this
is

petition

mr.

--
petition
of
amos
reece.
mr.
daniel
duke
may
it
--
mr.
daniel
duke
--
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
what
i
am
not
contending
before
i
go
into
the
facts,
because
i've
heard
many
of
these
cases
and
they
impinged
upon
the
same
general
violations,
and
i
think
i
might
expedite
it
and
also
clarify
some
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
case
if
i
state
first
what
i
am
not
contending
in
this
appeal.
the
petitioner
isn't
contending
that
the
state
of
georgia
doesn't
have
authority
to
regulate
the
mode
of
procedure
by
which
a
person
was
charged
with
the
capital
felony
may
be
tried
and
indicted.
we
are
not
contending
that
this
petitioner
has
a
right
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
have
members
of
the
negro
--
negro
race
proportionately
represented
on
the
grand
jury
list
or
on
the
grand
jury
that
indicts
here.
we
don't
contend
that
he's
entitled
to
have
members
of
the
negro
race
on
a
particular
trial
jury
which
tried
it.
we
do
contend
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
the
petitioner
is
protected
against
the
discrimination
against
members,
qualified
members
of
his
race
in
the
selection
of
--
and
the
make
up
of
the
grand
jury
and
petit
jury
list
and
in
selection
of
grand
jury,
also
in
petit
jurors.
both
of
the
questions
arise
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
case
before
the
court,
the
questions
presented
are
questions
that
have
been
before
this
court
on
many
occasions,
and
it's
in
the
application
of
the
facts
to
the
general
principles
of
law
that
i
wish
to
address
myself
because
there
are
some
unique
features
to
this
case.
this
man
has
been
tried
twice
under
the
same
indictment.
on
the
afternoon
of
october
the
20th,
1953,
a
white
female
was
ravished
in
cobb
county,
georgia.
later
that
afternoon,
the
petitioner
here,
amos
reece,
that's
late
in
the
afternoon
of
october
the
20th,
and
these
dates
are
important,
because
it
--
it's
around
the
dates
and
the
application
of
the
facts
to
the
principles
involved
here
that
we
claim
that
his
rights
have
been
denied
to
him.
late
in
the
afternoon
of
october
the
20th,
1953,
he
was
arrested,
and
he
was
lodged
in
the
common
jail
of
cobb
county,
georgia.
now
at
that
time,
the
grand
jury
which
had
been
summoned
in
cobb
county,
and
had
been
impaneled
and
sworn
on
october
the
12th,
eight
days
prior
to
the
commission
of
the
offense.
the
grand
jury
had
been
adjourned
on
october
the
19th,
the
day
before
the
commission
of
this
offense.
the
prisoner
--
the
--
the
petitioner
was
arrested
late
on
the
afternoon
of
october
the
20th.
on
the
morning
of
october
the
21st,
while
the
petitioner
was
in
jail,
the
judge
in
the
superior
court
reassemble
the
grand
jury
by
an
order
calling
him
to
be
back
on
the
morning
of
october
the
23rd.
and
in
that
order,
the
court
recited
that
certain
persons
were
being
held
in
the
common
jail
and
that
the
solicitor
general
would
present
them
for
indictment.
the
name
of
amos
reece,
the
petitioner,
who
was
arrested
the
day
before,
was
not
among
those
others
remained
in
the
order
and
registered
in
the
clerk's
office.
the
grand
jury
assembled
two
days
after
he
had
been
incarcerated
at
the
time
when
he
did
not
have
an
attorney.
on
the
23rd
of
october,
1953,
the
petitioner
was
indicted
for
a
capital
felony.
the
next
morning
was
saturday,
and
on
saturday
the
24th
of
october,
two
local
attorneys
were
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner.
on
october
the
30th,
1953,
the
petitioner
was
arraigned
in
court.
prior
to
pleadings
and
the
merits
of
the
indictment
which
had
been
returned
on
the
23rd,
he
filed
among
several
motion,
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
but
he
did
not
file
a
motion
to
set
aside
and
void
to
the
near
impaneled
of
petit
jurors
which
were
--
which
were
then
being
put
upon
him.
evidence
was
taken
by
the
court
on
october
the
30th,
1953,
as
to
discrimination
and
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
the
evidence
showed
that
there
was
six
names
of
negro
persons
out
of
approximately
600
names
in
the
grand
jury
box
that
one
of
those
persons
did
not
live
in
the
county,
therefore,
he
could
not
have
been
a
juror.
three
of
the
persons
were
82
years
old.
three
of
the
persons
were
62
years
old,
out
of
the
six
that
appeared.
the
same
six
persons,
names
appeared
in
a
--
the
box
of
2500
white
persons
whose
names
appeared
in
the
petit
jury
list.
so,
at
that
point,
the
same
objections
could
have
been
made
as
to
the
petit
juror
being
put
upon
him
at
that
trial,
that
was
made
pertaining
to
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
he
claimed
in
that
petition
through
the
attorneys
who
represented
him
and
i'll
state
to
the
court
that
i
prepared
the
petition,
the
local
attorneys
who
appointed
did
delete
certain
paragraphs
from
the
petition.
and
if
you
read
the
petition,
i
laid
the
file
at
the
second
trial,
i
think
the
court
will
recognize
why
those
local
attorneys
deleted
the
certain
paragraphs
that
i
had
inserted
into
the
petition.
it
was
purely
a
matter
of
protecting
their
local
situation.
but
the
court
heard
the
evidence.
the
evidence
disclosed
what
i
have
just
recited.
there
was
other
evidence
that
this
court
might
be
interested
in
that
could
have
been
either
for
or
in
behalf
of
the
motion
or
against
the
motion.
but
since
we
have
no
evidence
of
that
kind,
i'm
not
suggesting
or
going
into
it,
even
though
the
state
in
its
brief
has
sought
to
introduce
into
the
record,
to
the
instrumentality
of
its
brief,
facts
that
i
consider
that
should
not
be
applicable
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings.
that's
in
the
first
case.
the
case,
after
the
court
rejected
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
the
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
appears
in
210
georgia
at
page
578.
headnote
1
is
the
part
of
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
that
i
am
seeking
to
bring
now
before
this
court
by
review,
but
i'm
very
candidly
stating
that
i
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
will
consider
reversing
that
headnote
at
this
time
or
not.
but
it
should
be
considered
for
the
purpose
of
going
into
the
merits
of
the
plea
filed
by
the
state
at
his
second
trial
on
june
22nd,
1954.
and,
of
course,
i'm
insisting
that
this
court
should
go
in
to
the
matter
and
reverse
this
now
because
the
case
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
210
georgia
page
578,
not
due
to
the
raising
of
the
federal
question
challenging
the
legality
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
this
petitioner.
it
was
reversed
because
of
the
judges'
charge
on
the
question
of
insanity,
i
handle
that
appeal,
i
didn't
handle
the
trial.
we
didn't
appeal
from
this
ruling
in
the
210
georgia,
the
headnote
1.
but
in
that
ruling,
the
supreme
court
stated,
“we
will
not
consider
the
evidence
introduced
to
sustain
the
plea
to
quash
this
indictment
because
that
plea
came
too
late.
and
whether
he
had
counsel
or
not,
it
was
incumbent
upon
this
petitioner
to
make
a
plea
challenging
or
to
quash
the
indictment
prior
to
the
indictment.
i
could
see
that
there
are
georgia
cases
that
hold
that
where
one
challenges
a
juror
proper
defect
or
where
one
challenges
an
indictment
were
returned
by
a
grand
jury
because
the
officials
who
summon
the
grand
jury
had
not
complied
with
some
regulatory
means
by
which
the
grand
jury
was
brought
in
and
assembled,
but
not
one
of
those
cases
deals
with
a
--
the
raising
of
a
fundamental
right
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that's
significant.
because
in
the
crumb
case
and
i'm
going
to
give
this
court
some
cases
that
i
happen
to
have
handled
before
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
in
the
trial
courts.
the
crumb
case,
is
a
case
that
arose
in
georgia
on
a
misdemeanor
where
a
wealthy
landowner
had
broken
the
fences
and
run
into
the
farm
of
a
--
of
a
negro
man.
and
the
negro
man
had
taken
the
pistol
to
remove
him
from
his
property
after
calling
the
sheriff
and
getting
no
help.
and
finally,
the
sheriff
came
and
the
negro
man
was
indicted
on
for
five
misdemeanor
charges
and
lies
him
jail.
and
he
had
to
escape
a
mob.
and
we
went
into
this
local
county
to
defend
him
under
armed
guards,
and
i
made
the
motion.
he's
had
been
on
ban
for
eight
months.
and
i
made
the
motion
prior
to
go
in
the
trial.
and
i
attacked
the
indictment
and
the
petit
jury
list
in
one
and
the
same
proceeding.
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
justice
atkinson,
who
is
now
dead,
ruled
that
the
proceeding
was
illegal.
negroes
had
been
excluded
from
this
panel
and
if
they
constituted
a
sizeable
--
well
they
--
they've
constituted
a
sizeable
majority
of
the
seventh
amendment
county.
then
the
cofield
case
from
troup
county,
and
the
grimes
case
from
walton
county
cases,
were
the
same
identical
plea
made
prior
to
going
to
trial
on
the
indictment
but
made
after
the
indictment.
and
where
the
man
who
have
the
accused
had
been
in
jail
for
weeks.
and
where
the
grand
jury
was
summoned
and
impaneled
and
sworn
after
he
had
been
incarcerated,
they
had
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world
to
know.
in
this
case,
the
contention
is
the
man
was
without
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
indictment.
that
he
had
been
in
jail
approximately
48
hours.
that
had
he
had
counsel,
the
counsel
should
have
relied
upon
the
order
of
the
court
reassembling
an
adjourned
grand
jury
which
had
already
been
impaneled
and
sworn.
and
since
they
didn't
name
the
prisoner,
the
petitioner,
even
had
he
been
had
the
benefit
of
counsel.
counsel
could
have
relied
on
it
and
said
they
--
they
won't
consider
his
case.
now,
at
the
second
trial,
after
the
reversal,
the
motion
was
prepared
which
we
sought
to
prove
the
method
of
discrimination.
we
set
forth
in
detail
that
a
scheme
and
device
had
been
pursued
by
the
officials
of
the
county
to
prevent
negroes
from
being
on
the
specific
panels
of
trial
jurors
that
was
then
being
put
upon
him
in
june
22nd,
1954.
that's
the
second
trial.
in
addition
to
that,
and
in
an
effort
to
make
it
necessary
for
the
officials
in
the
local
counties
to
comply
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
by
having
qualified
negro
people
participate
in
the
administration
of
justice.
we
alleged
three
different
propositions.
one
was
that
never
had
a
judge
of
the
superior
court
appointed
one
of
six
negro
--
i
mean
one
of
six
jury
commissioners
from
qualified
members
of
the
negro
race.
because
there,
we
had
the
situation
of
an
infinitesimal
number
of
negro
peoples
names
being
in
the
box
were
sought
well,
accidentally
or
by
what
it
means
and
it
taxes
the
credulity
of
any
person
to
think,
that
on
that
of
the
six
persons
whose
names
appeared
in
the
grand
jury
list
and
in
the
petit
jury
list,
out
of
2500
in
the
petit
jury
list,
and
580
something
in
the
grand
jury
list.
out
of
the
six
negroes,
one
didn't
live
in
the
county
and
three
way
to
two
years
of
age
and
the
testimony
showed
that
they
had
high
blood
pressure
and
were
hard
of
hearing.
those
things
just
don't
happen.
so
in
order
to
get
around
that,
said
if
you
would
appoint
one
or
two
negro
persons
on
the
jury
commission
and
these
counties,
in
the
rural
counties
where
they
constitute
a
sizeable
minority
or
majority
of
the
citizens,
you
will
get
a
bona
fide
in
compliance
with
the
constitutional
mandate,
and
negro
people
will
begin
to
participate
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
until
you
do
that,
they
will
always
erect
some
systems,
sophisticated
system
of
circumventing
the
spirit
of
the
constitutional
mandate.
and
i
say
that
advisedly
out
of
many
years
of
experience
as
a
public
official
and
as
one
who
takes
three
of
these
--
these
type
cases
per
year.
that's
all
a
man
can
stand
for
this
type
today.
now,
when
we
filed
that
petition,
charged
in
the
petition,
prior
to
go
into
trial
at
the
second
time
when
the
new
venire
of
petit
jurors
has
been
put
upon
us.
we
could
have
never,
prior
to
that
time,
have
challenged
that
petit
jury,
because
that
was
the
first
time
that
it
have
been
put
on
us.
all
the
rules
pertaining
to
when
and
the
time
element
in
challenging
a
--
an
indictment
returned
by
jury
from
which
qualified
members
of
the
negro
race
had
been
excluded
because
of
their
race
and
color,
all
of
those
rules
could
not
be
applicable
to
this
type
of
situation.
so,
we
had
it
spelled
out
there
at
some
length
and
so
the
court
--
i
mean,
the
state
asked
for
an
hours'
adjournment.
we
had
subpoenaed
53
witnesses.
we
had
the
tax
receiver
to
show
the
yellow
slips
of
paper.
and
we
had
the
whole
works
there,
and
we
were
going
into
it.
so
they
came
back
with
a
plea.
they
called
it
a
demurrer.
they
called
it
res
judicata,
and
they
called
it
a
waiver,
all
three.
i
argued
it,
we
formed
the
court
that,
if
you
consider
that
the
matter
of
quashing
the
indictment
cannot
now
be
considered
because
of
the
ruling
in
210
georgia
page
578
had
not
won
because
it
came
too
late,
certainly,
that
could
not
be
applicable
to
our
charges
here
that
the
petit
jury,
that
petit
jury
that's
now
being
put
upon
this
man
has
had
eliminated
from
a
qualified
members
of
the
negro
race.
he
said,
“well,
you
went
to
trial
last
year
and
accepted
the
petit
jury,
therefore,
you
waived
your
right
to
challenge
this
petit
jury
that
--
then
they
also
replied
that
it
was
res
judicata.
the
supreme
court
had
passed
on
the
matter.
the
supreme
court
said,
“we
won't
look
at
the
evidence
in
this
case
as
to
the
indictment.”
now
why,
why
they
stated
that?
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
because
the
court
knew
that
they
would
reverse
the
case,
that
we'll
leave
us
to
go
back
to
the
court,
that
in
some
way,
there
might
be
a
president
there,
that
without
playing
on
a
procedural
matter,
the
right
of
a
man
to
make
this
challenge.
well,
i
was
confronted
with
that
problem.
erroneously
or
correctly,
i
decided
not
to
appeal
the
ruling
made
in
the
210th
georgia,
but
to
insert
all
of
that
plea
at
the
second
trial
and
bring
it
up
as
a
part
of
the
record
if
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
show
what
it
happened,
because
that
ruling
clearly
violated
the
right
of
this
petitioner
to
the
aid
and
benefit
of
counsel.
if
you
can
cut
off,
you
can
say
to
a
--
a
petitioner
in
one
breath
that
you
must
file
a
technical
plea,
and
that
plea
must
be
filed
prior
to
the
indictment.
and
then
you
tell
him
that
you
don't
have
any
right
to
have
a
--
call
a
lawyer
to
do
that
for
you.
then,
if
you
have
to
follow
the
state
procedure,
if
this
court
must
follow
the
state
procedure
in
that
respect,
then
this
court
is
taking
away
from
itself
the
power
to
reexamine
and
to
determine
whether
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
ones
rights
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
been
deprived.
i
go
further
at
the
--
upon
the
presentation
of
the
challenge
to
the
array
of
the
petit
jury
at
the
second
trial,
the
court,
after
hearing
the
argument,
we
setup
in
the
second
one
that
this
man
was
in
jail
without
counsel,
that
he
was
of
low
mentality
and
there's
some
evidence
here
to
show
that
he
had
a
very
low
mentality.
he
didn't
sustain
his
plea
of
insanity
but
he
--
he
stated
a
plea
of
semi
or
to
be
semi-moron.
we
took
the
position
that
the
court
must
permit
us
to
put
in
evidence
to
show
the
scheme
and
device
by
which
persons
had
been
negro
--
qualified
members
of
the
negro
race
had
been
eliminated
from
the
petit
jury
list
of
the
county.
now,
the
jury
list
of
the
county
of
cobb
consisted
of
2500
names
of
person
in
the
petit
jury
list.
another
box
contained
25%
of
those
names
in
the
grand
jury
list.
the
six
negro
names
that
appeared,
appeared
in
both
list,
both
the
grand
jury
list
and
the
petit
jury
list,
you've
already
heard
the
other
facts
as
to
the
age
of
it.
now,
the
court
sustained
the
demurrer.
the
record
doesn't
show
what
happened
but
the
court
just
said
they
sustained
demurrer
and
dismissed
the
plea.
they
didn't
state
whether
it
was
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
pleading,
the
--
the
order
at
which
you
have
before
you
doesn't
state
that
it
was
on
the
plea
of
res
judicata.
the
order
doesn't
state
that
it
was
because
they
were
saying
we
had
waived
our
right,
it
just
said
we
sustained
and
dismissed.
well,
i
had
to
take
it
there.
so
we
have
it
here.
so
it
had
to
be
one
of
them.
whichever
one
it
was,
we
contend
that
that
ruling
itself
prevented
us
from
making
a
record.
that
under
the
rulings
of
this
court,
this
court
would
have
to
determine,
whether
or
not,
the
plea
was
good
in
the
first
instance
and
while
i
haven't
found
any
cases
stating
that
this
court
will
be
the
judge
as
to
whether
it's
res
judicata
or
not,
i
think
that
there
is
a
ruling
in
the
court
that
you
can
reinsert
the
name
res
judicata
and
it
would
be
--
it
would
have
the
same
effect.
because
this
court,
as
stated
in
many
cases,
that
this
court
is
the
judge
of
the
pleadings
are
right
where
they
said
all
right,
deprivation
of
a
right
arising
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
that
this
court
will
make
an
independent
determination
of
the
facts
in
spite
of
a
state
ruling
own
the
matter
of
discrimination.
so
it's
only
illogical
extension
of
that
rule
saying
that
this
court
would
have
to
also
examine
to
see
if
there
had
been
a
waiver
or
to
see
if
it
was
res
judicata.
well,
how
could
it
--
a
matter
of
stating,
the
court
ruling
in
210
georgia
that
regardless
of
the
evidence
brought
by
this
petitioner
to
show
discrimination
against
members,
qualified
members
of
the
negro
race
within
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him,
regardless
of
the
evidence,
regardless
of
the
old
man
on
it,
we
won't
consider
it
because
it
was
brought
too
late,
were
brought
after
indictment
and
it
makes
no
difference
mr.
petitioner
whether
you
had
counsel
or
didn't
have
counsel.
how
could
that
be
res
judicata
that
a
jury
--
petit
jury
summoned
a
year
after
which
to
try
the
man
at
the
second
trial
that
ruling
had
adjudicated
the
fact
of
discrimination
as
to
the
petit
jury.
or
how
could
it
be
a
waiver?
so,
we
come
down
did
we
state
enough
and
i
will
plea
to
show
to
get
into
court
to
prove
it
there.
if
we
did,
then
the
court
committed
error
in
--
in
dismissing
our
plea,
and
he
should
be
remanded
for
further
trial.
now,
the
state
doesn't
seriously
contend
in
its
brief.
the
state
doesn't
contend
in
its
brief
that
the
court
was
right.
the
state,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
211
georgia
page
339,
hurdles
the
whole
question.
it
wouldn't
go
into
the
question.
we've
just
stated
that
we
passed
on
this
case
and
that
plea.
but
they
didn't
--
in
spite
of
the
facts
in
the
record,
they
characterized
our
plea
at
the
second
trial
as
the
same
plea
we
had
made
at
the
first
one.
and
the
record
was
before
when
filed
a
motion
for
a
rehearing
and
i
alleged
it.
they
haven't
said
anything
until
this
late
hour
to
characterize
it
as
to
what
it
really
was.
now,
there
was
the
reason
that
they
didn't
want
me
to
go
into
the
facts
in
that
case,
of
course.
and
i
think
the
reason
is
born
out
by
something
and
i
had
hoped
that
the
state
would
be
here.
i
had
hoped
that
the
state
of
georgia
would
--
would
have
counsel
here
to
answer
my
reply
brief,
because
in
my
reply
brief,
i
take
page
by
page,
and
cite
where
the
state
had
misquoted
the
record
to
this
court.
and
i
went
further
than
that,
i
went
over
in
person
and
i
asked
him.
i
said,
“don't
you
want
to
correct
it?”
now,
i
filed
a
two-page
supplement
here
which
emphasizes
everything
that
i
had
said
here.
it
came
too
late
for
me
to
be
able
to
put
it
in
the
reply
brief
so
i
filed
it
here
for
whatever
consideration
this
court
wishes
to
give
it.
that
this
court
would
turn
to
the
states
brief.
mr.
daniel
duke
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
duke
you
could
eliminate
all
--
just
all
of
them
by
doing
that.
mr.
daniel
duke
now,
but
the
significant
thing
--
mr.
daniel
duke
some
georgia
counties
have
a
--
the
grand
jury
suits
for
three
months.
i
mean
they--
they're
eligible
--
eligible
to
serve
for
three
months.
mr.
daniel
duke
they
can
be
recalled,
and
the
court
will
enter
upon
the
minutes
that
he's
recalled
of
--
of
any
matters
occur
during
the
term
of
their
service.
in
the
rural
counties,
a
grand
jury
is
summoned
in
this
manner.
they
have
two
boxes
and
it
kept
under
locked.
they
put
the
tabs
in
of
the
names
that
have
been
made
by
six
men,
six
jury
commissions,
appointed
by
the
superior
court
judges.
these
jury
commissioners
usually
rely
on
the
clerks
as
a
matter
of
fact.
however,
they
can
get
independent
information.
but
it's
a
normal
thing.
the
clerk
of
the
court
will
go
and
compile
list
of
names
from
the
tax
digest
of
the
county.
in
this
particular
county,
and
in
nearly
every
county
of
the
state
and
is
embodied
in
statute
and
by
a
ruling
of
the
department
of
revenue,
and
i
see
no
actual
objection
to
that.
it
sometimes
facilitates
a
speed
in
handling
matters.
they
have
the
negro
taxpayers
all
in
a
--
one
or
segregated
from
the
white
taxpayers
by
volume,
and
they
would
be
on
black
paper
and
white
taxpayers
on
white
paper.
they
go
and
they
are
supposed
to
look
at
the
taxpayers
at
--
at
this
particular
time,
who,
with
21
years
of
age
and
older,
that
they
thought,
according
to
the
statutory
scheme
were
qualified
to
be
jurors.
as
a
rule,
the
25%
of
the
petit
jurors
must
be
in
the
grand
jury
box,
and
they
usually
comply
with
that.
periodically,
two
intervals
i
think
the
jury
commissioners
assembled
and
they
reformed
the
list.
and
they
maintained
in
a
box,
and
also
the
names
of
the
jurors
are
maintained
in
the
clerk
--
superior
courts
office
and
dig
black
books,
alphabetical
according
to
militia
districts,
for
voting
precincts
in
the
county.
all
those
books
will
indicate
the
white
jurors
and
then
they'll
have
a
section
for
negroes
if
they
held
them.
then
those
names
are
put
in
the
petit
jury
box,
it's
locked.
all
of
the
names
in
this
county,
2500,
in
the
petit
jury
box,
there
might
be
10
more,
but
that's
a
proximity
number,
500
and
something
or
25%
exceeded
a
little,
25%
of
those
same
names
go
into
the
grand
jury
box.
mr.
daniel
duke
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
duke
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
duke
so,
the
court,
when
if
a
new
term
begins
in
the
court,
and
the
grand
jury
served
with
the
terms
of
the
court,
the
court
will
call
the
clerk
and
the
deputy
sheriff,
they
roll
the
boxes
in,
they
usually
shake
them.
and
the
court
turns
his
head
and
he
reaches
in
and
closed
them,
and
the
clerk
takes
them
and
writes
them
on
a
name
until
they
got
a
sufficient
number.
they
always
have
more
than
they
actually
need
to
comprise
the
grand
jury,
because
they
recognized
it
when
they
impanel
them
and
swear
them
that
there
will
always
be
excuses
made.
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
1952,
as
i
stated,
there
was
--
the
name
of
six
negroes
were
put
in
the
jury
box.
out
of
--
at
that
time,
the
males
who
would've
--
whose
names
appeared
on
the
tax
digest
who
could've
been
picked
out
1780
negro
males
who
paid
taxes.
now,
the
ratio
by
population
would
be
greater
in
that
county,
but
--
and
--
and
the
ratio
now
would
be
high,
because
more
of
the
negroes
are
paying
taxes.
they
have
to
build
you
a
pharma
plant
there,
and
the
negroes
wages
have
increased
and
they
bought
things
and
we're
taxing
more
things
now
that
we
did
then.
we
constantly
--
taxing
more
of
the
little
things
so
as
the
constant
--
yes
they're
all
the
negro
people.
now,
names
appear
on
the
tax
digest.
but,
basically
that
is
a
malice
by
which
we
select
grand
jurors.
now,
the
petit
jury
boxes
appeal
in
the
same
way
except
they
don't
serve
itself.
mr.
daniel
duke
23.
mr.
daniel
duke
well,
that's
not
quite
clear.
i
think
in
some
counties,
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice,
the
judge
says
who
am
i,
when
they
draw
him
out,
if
your
name
comes
out,
six,
you
call
six,
if
you
don't
have
a
legal
excuse,
you're
number
six.
he
does
that
as
a
matter
to
be
fair
to
himself.
i've
never
been
quite
satisfied
as
to
what
happens
in
some
of
them
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
they
consciously
eliminate,
i
wouldn't
say.
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far
--
mr.
daniel
duke
--
to
sustain
my
position
here
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
do
it.
mr.
daniel
duke
if
--
if
i
thought
that
happened,
i
would
make
the
challenge
then
and
i
would
claim
it
and
try
to
put
in
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
duke
--
to
show
it
did
happen.
mr.
daniel
duke
we
don't
understand
them.
mr.
daniel
duke
we
do
and
--
and
i'm
certain
that
that
happens.
mr.
daniel
duke
we
--
we
don't
have
the
same
practice
that
they
had
in
louisiana,
but
they
draw
36
names,
usually.
and
23
of
those
names
comprise
a
grand
jury
for
return.
mr.
daniel
duke
sometimes
it'd
be
three
months,
subject
to
recall.
i
mean,
during
the
three
months
interval,
they
may
not
serve
over
two
days.
within
the
larger
counties,
it'd
be
two
months
and
they
serve
twice
a
week
and
they
--
they
continue.
but
the
various
--
some
discretion,
but
that's
the
practice.
mr.
daniel
duke
but
the
challenge
made
here
to
the
indictment,
and
this
case
embodies
a
lot
more
than
just
a
challenge
to
this
indictment
or
to
quash
the
indictment,
the
main
thing
it
brings
this
case
here
is
the
--
is
the
opinion
in
the
211th
georgia
when
they
deprived
him
of
the
right
to
put
in
evidence
of
discrimination
that
is
trial
as
to
the
petit
jury.
mr.
daniel
duke
i
sought
to
go
back
to
put
in
then
incorporate
in
that
also
the
same
reason
as
to
the
grand
jury.
and
my
position
is
here,
that
they
might,
under
the
rogers
case
from
alabama
had
stated
that
you've
got
two
things
here
that
they
prolix
it
too
much,
we've
done
adjudicated
that
and
might
have
a
serious
problem
there.
but
they
certainly
couldn't
say,
“you
can't
challenge
this
particularly.”
the
near
impaneled
of
petit
jurors
put
upon
you
because
you
waived
that
right
back
there
when
you
brought
up
the
matter
of
the
grand
jury,
where
they
didn't
even
challenge
the
petit
jury.
it
might
have
been
that
the
petit
jury
at
that
time
that
--
that
the
lawyers
handling
it
and
that's
contrary
to
the
reality
of
this
situation,
of
course.
but,
it
could
have
well
been,
that
--
have
they
had
many
negroes
in
the
jury
box
that
they
had
made
or
bona
fide
the
attempt
or
there
had
been
no
discrimination
whereas
a
year
from
then,
they
might
concoct
some
system
that
it
--
for
the
purpose
of
the
trial,
eliminate.
qualified
negroes
whose
names
were
in
the
box
but
who
hadn't
been
drawn,
who
had
been
removed
after
being
drawn.
there
are
many
reasons,
as
a
matter
of
proof,
and
that's
the
reason
that
i'm
here.
but
here's
the
insignificant
thing
in
this
case,
the
state
in
its
brief
in
a
footnote,
and
this
a
--
this
is
to
my
mind
where
a
life
is
involved,
and
where
a
state
itself,
its
law
department,
is
before
this
court.
i
would
not
recommend
this
type
procedure
in
any
type
proceeding
but
it
is
--
it
becomes
magnified
when
it
happens
here.
if
you
look
at
the
state's
brief
at
page
11
footnote
8,
i
want
to
call
your
particular
attention
to
the
matter
here
that
i
encouraged
him
to
come
because
i
took
the
claims
to
go
and
get
the
facts.
i
say
the
record
of
the
court
show,
now
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record,
you
won't
find
any
evidence
except
this
in
what
i
say
and
reply
to
it.
i
don't
approve
the
method,
but
after
they
brought
it
into
the
record,
and
i
asked
them
to
correct
it,
then
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
go
and
get
the
facts
and
to
show
this
court
what
the
real
facts
were,
and
that's
what
i
did.
and
i
think
that's
one
reason
why,
perhaps,
they
aren't
here
today,
and
i
don't
know
this
court,
after
reading
this,
may
want
them
up
here
to
answer
some
of
this.
the
record
that
the
court
shows,
this
is
what
the
state
of
georgia
stating,
that
since
1952,
now
mark
this
word,
1952,
negroes
have
frequently
served
on
petit
juries
and
several
times
on
grand
juries.
in
addition,
several
more
were
called
for
grand
juror
service
but
were
excused
on
their
own
request.
at
one
draw,
during
this
year,
that's
1955,
now,
and
these
things
happened
in
1953
and
1954,
three
negroes
served
on
a
jury
trying
the
case.
well
now,
of
course,
that's
a
--
well
now
what
are
the
facts
about
that?
why
did
they
use
the
year
of
1952?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1952,
we
have
in
the
record
what
had
happened.
they
had
six
names.
one
of
them
would
--
didn't
even
live
in
the
jurisdiction.
three
of
them
waited
two
years
of
age
and
they
were
hard
of
hearing
and
had
high
blood
pressure.
and
that
was
an
infinitesimal
number,
conscious
limitation.
that
was
in
1953
when
we
put
in
the
plea
or
when
the
attorneys
put
in
the
plea
in
october,
1953.
that
condition
exists,
so
why
do
we
go
back
and
say
1952?
well,
i'll
let
this
court
draw
its
conclusions,
but
what
are
the
facts?
that
decision
was
reversed.
we
sought
to
bring
it
up
again,
in
addition
to
a
test
to
the
petit
jury.
on
june
the
22nd,
1954,
is
when
i
filed,
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
a
long
objection
to
that
method
of
selected
names
where
i
stated
that
they
should
--
they
had
consciously
eliminated
members
of
the
negro
race
from
the
jury
commission.
30
days
thereafter,
they
called
the
jury
commission
back.
that
was
in
1954
and
they
are
not
1952,
and
no
figures
are
given
here.
we
had
no
way
of
anticipating
in
such
thing,
as
this
would
be
in
the
record,
by
brief
even.
so
what
happens?
first
of
august,
1954,
the
jury
commission
was
called
back,
what
did
they
do
when
they
were
called
back?
they've
put
57
negroes
name
in
the
grand
jury
box
--
i
think
that's
correct
i've
got
the
copy
of
it
here.
the
records
maintained
and
they
open
it
to
the
clerk
superior
court
of
cobb
county,
showed
that
the
jury
commission
of
cobb
county,
georgia
were
reassembled
for
the
purpose
of
revising
the
jury
list
on
august
the
1st,
1954.
it
was
june
the
22nd
when
we
made
this
wholesale
attack
when
we
had
the
witnesses
there
and
they'd
subpoenaed
by
duces
tecum
of
the
records
into
the
court,
39
days
after
the
second
trial
for
this
petition.
it
was
at
a
second
trial
that
he
made
a
motion
challenging
the
array
of
the
petit
jury,
put
upon
him.
on
august
the
30th,
the
jury
commission
of
the
county
certified
a
new
and
revised
list
to
the
grand
jurors
of
cobb
county,
the
new
list
of
jurors
contained
the
name
of
27
negro
citizens.
therefore,
immediately
after
the
petitioner
made
his
charge,
prior
to
going
to
trial
on
the
indictment,
the
jury
commission
of
the
county
reassembled
and
revised
the
list.
then
they
put
157
or
160
negroes
names
in
the
petit
jury
box.
now,
my
contention
is
that
that
coming
immediately
after,
this
wholesale
challenge
proves
that
they
were
conscious
of
their
conscious
discrimination.
and
my
contention
is
also
that
it
was
not
quite
the
thing
to
do
for
the
state
in
its
brief
to
say
since
1952,
they
had
the
date,
why
didn't
they
say
since
august,
1954,
some
days
after
we
had
made
this
challenge.
now,
i
wish,
in
my
concluding
remarks
to
say
that
they
--
that
i
quote
that
this
court
will
pass
upon
the
matter
of
the
jury
commission
in
this
case
because
it's
open
on
an
abstract
principle
of
law.
this
court
can
state,
if
you
can
prove
as
a
part
of
the
pattern
of
discrimination
and
the
selection
of
jurors
that
they
discriminated
even
so
far
as
selecting
the
jury
commissioners,
then
we've
got
a
price
to
go
into
and
make
them
comply
with
the
mandates
and
with
the
spirit
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
because
until
we
do
that,
we
won't
get
much
rectification
for
the
wrong
in
rural
counties
in
my
section
of
the
country.
