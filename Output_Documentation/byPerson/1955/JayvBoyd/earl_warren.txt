mr.
maslow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
case
was
decided
against
the
deportee,
it
wouldn't
go
to
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
caughlan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
caughlan,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
caughlan,
before
you
get
to
that.
i
don't
quite
get
that
--
your
point
on
the
reporting
to
congress
because
they
don't'
report
to
congress
unless
it's
planted,
unless
his
suspension
is
granted.
now,
if
it's
--
if
it's
denied
to
the
applicant
on
--
on
confidential
information,
it
would
never
get
--
never
get
to
congress.
so,
how
--
how
does
that
manifest
desire
on
the
part
of
congress
to
prevent
a
confidential
information
being
used?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
were
--
i'm
just
talking
about
the
congress,
you're
--
you're
talking
about
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
fact
that
they
--
that
they
didn't
provide
for
it
or
they
provide
for
listing
all
of
the
evidence
on
which
it
was
based.
but
it's
only
when
--
when
the
ruling
is
favorable
to
the
--
to
the
applicant
that
they
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
a
hearing
was
required
or
not,
your
position
would
be
just
the
same.
now,
let's
assume
that
there
was
no
hearing
provided
for
by
the
attorney
general
then
wouldn't
he
be
free
to
act
in
his
discretionary
capacity
on
any
information
that
he
might
have
from
any
place
as
he
would
in
the
clemency
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
even
though
the
--
the
attorney
general
had
not
prescribed
a
procedure
for
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
connection
with
the
suspension?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it's
all
right.
mr.
lindsay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
it,
mr.
lindsay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
34
of
the
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
in
--
it's
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
there
in
the
record
here
to
show
what
--
what
the
confidential
information
was
against
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
we
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know
what
the
confidential
information
was
that
they
acted
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
we
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know
that
it
wasn't
the
type
that
they
took
from
the
street?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
someone
said
on
the
street
that
he
was
a
dangerous
radical
and
he
was
trying
to
destroy
the
government
and
so
forth,
would
you
mean
that
they
wouldn't
use
that
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
information
would
you
say
they
did
use
under
that
--
your
interpretation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we're
talking
about
the
kind
of
information
that
they
used
but
which
they
got
off
the
street.
now,
what
kind
of
information
would
it
be
that
they
got
off
the
street
that
they
would
use
against
the
man,
the
confidential
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
said
he
did,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
read
it
again
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
please,
i'd
like
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
the
fbi
report
was
clear
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
that
they
would
--
they
would
file
one
report
in
the
case
showing
that
it
was
clear,
the
record
was
clear
and
then
file
another
one
in
the
case
that
--
showing
that
he
was
not
clear
but
the
defendant
have
--
would
have
no
access
to
that
or
not
even
know
that
it
was
filed.
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
would
--
your
reporting
agency
would
split
it
up
in
that
way,
might
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
showing
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he
--
he
was
clear
on
the
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
another
undercover
one
that
would
show
that
he
was
not
clear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
no
information
to
the
--
to
the
deportee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lindsay,
before
you
proceed,
before
you
leave
this
subject,
you
commented
on
the
testimony
of
one
of
these
service
investigators
but
you
didn't
comment
on
the
evidence
of
the
others.
would
you
do
that
please
and
give
us
your
version
of
that
and
i'm
referring
to
12
--
page
12
of
this
amicus
brief
that
you
pointed
to.
the
first
one
said
that
it
was
just
merely
information
we
received
off
the
street
and
then
it
goes
on.
the
next
one
says
described
it
as
"what
might
be
termed
as
hearsay
evidence
which
could
not
be
gotten
into
the
record."
and
then
there's
some
following
that,
how
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
explain
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
other
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
says
--
says
such
things
perhaps
as
income
tax
reports
or
maybe
a
witness
who
didn't
want
to
be
disclosed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
he
has
--
he's
entitled
to
exclude
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
the
thing
that's
bothering
me
is
this
--
is
this
one
hearing
that
you
have
on
the
deportation
and
on
the
suspension.
now,
if
the
hearing
officer
can
take
into
consideration
not
only
the
--
the
evidence
which
is
in
the
record
but
also
any
kind
of
hearsay
testimony
or
--
or
information
he
gets
off
the
street
or
anything
of
that
kind.
how
can
he
differentiate
between
the
suspension
proceeding
and
the
--
the
deportation
proceeding
when
he
comes
to
make
his
determination
as
to
whether
a
man
should
be
deported
on
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
is
this,
in
the
deportation
hearing,
perhaps
there
is
a
conflict,
direct
conflict
of
--
of
testimony.
the
government
contends
one
thing,
the
--
the
subject
contends
another
and
in
that
case
i
thought
the
hearing
officer
was
suppose
to
give
a
fair
and
the
impartial
trial
on
that
evidence.
but
under
these
regulations,
you
permit
him
to
go
out
on
the
street
and
get
any
kind
of
information
he
wants.
any
kind
of
hearsay
that
he
wants,
look
into
--
to
the
income
tax
reports
and
take
the
testimony
of
witnesses
who
don't'
want
to
appear
and
let
him
use
that
in
the
proceeding
to
see
whether
he'll
also
recommend
a
suspension
or
not.
how
can
he
separate
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
a
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
humanly
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
a
judge
trying
a
case
was
to
have
one
hearing
in
court
and
on
the
record
there
was
a
conflict.
and
then
he
went
outside
and
--
and
had
subside
hearings,
took
into
consideration
the
very
things
that
are
being
taken
into
consideration
here
then
made
his
decision,
do
you
think
that
would
stand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
he
has
a
right
then
to
go
out
and
say,
"well,
i
excluded
it
because
the
record's
got
to
be
clear,
but
i'll
--
i'll
go
in
the
back
room
and
i'll
--
i'll
hear
what
it
is
and
now
use
it
in
the
case."
do
you
think
he
can
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
lindsay,
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
this,
under
244
(a)
that's
the
--
that's
the
section
giving
him
the
--
the
attorney
general
the
discretion.
let
us
assume
that
the
deportee
prove
that
he
had
been
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
a
continuous
period
of
not
less
than
10
years
immediately
following
the
commission
of
an
act
or
the
assumption
of
a
status
constituting
a
ground
for
deportation
and
proves
that
during
all
such
period
he
has
been
and
is
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
do
you
believe
that
those
things
were
shown
that
there
was
still
an
unlimited
discretion
in
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
the
minimum
requirements,
suppose
he
proved
that
he'd
been
here
the
10
years
and
had
--
had
--
during
all
of
such
time
had
been
a
person
of
good
moral
character
and
that
it
would
result
in
exceptional
and
extremely
unusual
hardship
to
him
or
to
his
spouse,
parent
or
child
who
is
a
citizen,
could
he
still
--
would
he
still
then
have
unlimited
discretion
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
used
it
in
that
sense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
is
unlimited?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
he
get
--
does
he
get
a
right
to
present
his
side
of
the
story
on
the
confidential
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
the
thing
they
act
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
it
act
on
--
apparently
on
the
--
on
what's
in
the
record,
they
act
on
the
confidential
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
lindsay,
do
you
think
there's
any
distinction
between
the
situation
where
the
examiner
is
permitted
to
take
into
consideration
this
confidential
information
on
the
one
hand
and
where
perhaps
the
attorney
general,
after
he
had
reviewed
all
of
the
proceedings,
might
himself
take
--
take
confidential
information
into
consideration
to
determine
whether
he
would
overrule
his
board
or
not?
if
--
if
there's
to
be
a
hearing
that
is
a
fair
hearing
as
--
as
this
sense,
it
must
be
a
fair
hearing,
do
you
not
think
that
the
hearing
officer
should
be
required
to
give
a
hearing
based
upon
evidence
and
then
make
his
findings
and
report
it
through
the
--
through
the
board
of
appeals
and
eventually
up
to
the
attorney
general
with
--
with
what
discretionary
power
he
may
--
may
have
to
act
on.
isn't
it
one
thing
for
him
to
act
and
that
when
another
thing
for
this
man,
who
is
presumably
deciding
a
thing
on
a
record,
to
take
into
consideration
confidential
information
of
a
hearsay
nature
concerning
which
the
--
the
deportee
knows
absolutely
nothing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
says
so,
but
he
doesn't
tell
--
he
doesn't
tell
what
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
man
therefore
doesn't
have
an
opportunity
to
--
to
prove
under
24
--
244
(a)
(5)
that
during
all
of
such
times
he
has
been
and
he's
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
no
matter
of
what
--
what
proof
he
might
make,
the
confidential
information
can
just
wipe
it
out
and
--
but
he
has
no
opportunity
to
--
to
answer
it.
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
we'll
take
244
(a)
(5).
that
says
that
the
discretion
should
be
exercised
when
the
man
proves
he
has
been
in
the
country
10
years
and
that
during
all
of
that
time
he
has
been
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
now,
he
--
he
goes
into
--
into
the
hearing
and
he
proves
that
to
--
to
--
apparently
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
--
of
the
hearing
officer,
of
the
record,
nothing
is
said
about
it
and
then
when
the
order
comes
out
it
says
on
confidential
information
we
deny
it.
how
--
how
can
a
man
prove
anything
in
a
--
in
a
hearing
under
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
can
a
man
prove
anything
concerning
charges
he
doesn't
know
anything
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
unfortunately
--
unfortunately
there
are.
if
the
charges
were
there
maybe
he
could
prove
it,
but
--
but
he
can't
prove
anything
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
hearing
officer.
the
hearing
officer
can
take
any
kind
of
--
of
hearsay
and
the
consideration
that
he
desires,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
lindsay,
you
--
you
say
that
there
are
some
limits
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
and
that
he
could
not
say,
“i
won't
let
--
i
won't
let
a
man
stay
here
because
his
red
headed
and
i
don't
like
that.
i
--
i
won't
let
this
other
man
stay
because
he's
black
headed
and
i
don't
like
--
i
don't
like
that.”
you
say
that
--
that
he
couldn't
do
that.
now,
how
would
anybody
know
that
that's
what
he
based
his
decision
on
if
all
he
says
is
i
did
it
on
confidential
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
put
some
limit
on
his
discretion.
it
was
the
reason
as
i
am
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
i
don't
see
how
you
could
determine
whether
he
had
exceeded
that
discretion
or
not
if
you
couldn't
show
what
the
confidential
information
he
acted
on.
that's
--
that's
my
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
you
ever
know,
mr.
lindsay,
if
all
they
ever
said
was
we
do
this
on
confidential
information
which
we
refuse
to
reveal,
how
would
you
ever
determine
that
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
in
that
statute
that
he
has
an
--
to
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
it
or
does
it
just
say
that
--
that
in
the
discretion
of
the
officers,
that
being
the
fact,
he
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
lose
his
family.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
little
different
