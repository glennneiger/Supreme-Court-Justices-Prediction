justice

would
--
would
a
hearing
be
necessary?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
--
that's
a
question
i
wanted
to
raise
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
under
--
if
you
turn
to
page
56
of
your
brief,
20
--
244
(a)
(5),
”he
may
suspend
in
his
discretion
in
case
of
an
alien
who,”
and
then
drop
down
into
(5)
and
you'll
find
that
says,
"who
proves
that
during
all
of
such
period
he
has
been.”
it
apparently
implies
an
opportunity
to
prove
which
makes
it
possible
the
argument
that
--
that
he's
entitled
to
a
rehearing.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
doesn't
the
statute
provide
for
a
hearing
and
it
says
that
the
alien
who
proves
isn't
--
isn't
that
implicit
--
a
hearing
implicit
in
--
in
the
word
prove?
