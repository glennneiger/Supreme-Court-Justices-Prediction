justice

what
is
the
largest
--
what
is
the
predominant
cause
for
the
20,000
arguments
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
your
illegal
entry
unrelated
from
disclosure
of
adverse
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
it's
maybe
illegal
because
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
the
seven
of
the
20,000
that
belongs
to
an
excludable
subversives
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
word
i
reject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
exactly
is
the
number?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
i
guess
i
haven't
made
my
point.
90%
of
illegal
entry,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know,
of
the
90%,
what
percentage
is
attributed
to
excludability
because
of
associations
at
least
per
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
this
is
in
where
--
that
is
your
remark,
the
review
of
a
subversives
activity.
it
may
be
excluded
in
causing
subversive
activity
or
would
have
been
excluded
as
it
came
in
by
the
questions
of
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
want
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
all
the
attorney
general
has
suspended
some
people,
has
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
there
is
no
public
--
this
notification
of
congress
was
not
made
publicly
going
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
it
says?
justice
felix
frankfurter
getting
a
list?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
said
--
the
statute
says
it
was
the
reason
for
such
suspension
that
such
report
shall
be
submitted
on
the
first
and
15th
day
of
each
calendar
month
in
which
congress
is
in
session.
now,
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you're
saying
that
the
attorney
general
communicate
confidentially
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
somebody
in
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
he
give
any
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
answer
that
this
provision
of
an
act
of
congress
requiring
you
to
report
with
the
reason,
it's
interpreted
in
the
act
to
be
that
he
have
made
--
whispered
to
somebody's
ears
what
the
reasons
are,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
you
can
say
this,
he
was
--
you
have
said
the
contrary
namely
that
there's
nothing
in
print
which
gives
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
there
were
reports
to
congress
according
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
problem
would
never
arrive,
mr.
lindsay,
except
where
he
found
that
he
was
deportable.
the
suspension
problem
doesn't
arrive
except
in
after
determination
of
deportability,
mr.
lindsay,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
therefore
--
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
everything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you've
opened
up,
but
i
do
not
see
the
force
of
your
point
he'd
been
found
deportable.
the
argument
is
that
having
been
found
being
deportable,
congress
didn't'
say
therefore
he
should
be
deported.
congress
deposited
some
relieving
power
in
the
power
of
the
attorney
general.
congress
didn't
let
the
attorney
general
to
his
own
undisclosed,
uncontested
determination
of
whether
you
should
have
this
right
of
litigation
or
not.
it
doesn't
follow
because
congress
could
have
passed
a
statute
which
left
this
in
the
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
it
doesn't
follow
that
even
he
himself
might
have
that
power,
that
if
he
does
formulate
a
scheme,
a
procedure
for
determining
something
that
that
procedure
must
have
some
rational
relation
to
the
end
to
be
determined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
you
can't
do
that
but
you
can
determine
the
procedure
by
which
he
can
determine
it
and
which
enables
you
to
meet
it.
you're
going
to
go
in
due
course
to
the
question
whether
--
although
congress
left
him
free,
he
determined
to
setup
the
procedures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
he's
bound
by
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
driven
back
to
the
regulations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
political
powers
may
be
give
him
juridical
procedure.congress
may
do
lots
of
things
without
sending
it
over
to
the
courts
or
requiring
a
court
procedure
but
from
time
to
time
does
a
conference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
against
that,
i
put
the
la
abra
case
in
which
congress
could
have
settled
the
matter
by
legislation
or
through
political
channel
or
diplomatic
channels
but
the
perfect
view
is
through
the
court
channels.
so,
we
don't
get
totally
involved
by
these
abstract
categories
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
return
to
my
desire
to
enlightenment
from
you
as
to
whether
or
not
a
regulation
by
which
the
attorney
general
found
himself,
and
i
say
found
himself
by
official
reason.
what's
the
implication
through
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
$4020?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
$4020
you
conceive
this
act
of
grace?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
look
at
--
really
i
must
say,
we
weaken
your
argument
by
insisting
that
this
applies
to
deportable
aliens,
of
course
that's
what
it
applies
to,
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
so,
what's
the
point
of
that
observation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
the
attorney
general
act
according
to
some
rational
standard
and
so
he
wouldn't
be
discriminated?
presumably,
in
allowing
this
--
this
act
of
grace,
i
agree
with
your
characterization,
in
allowing
this
act
of
grace
presumably
not
to
--
not
to
kiss
it
by
favor
but
kiss
it
by
reason,
if
i'm
not
contradicting
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
it
isn't
individualistic
so
far
as
standard
goes.
the
attorney
general,
no
matter
who
he
is,
can't
say
i
like
this
feller
and
i
don't
like
that
feller.
there
must
be
some
underlying
standards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
arises
whether
--
and
the
question
arises
whether
in
construing
a
regulation
by
him,
i
take
it
that's
what
justice
harlan
means
by
administrative
proceedings.
in
construing
the
regulation
by
him
which
he
saw
fit
to
formulate,
to
set
up
isn't
conflict
--
asking
on
confidential
information.
doesn't
that
have
such
likely
a
rule
that's
caprice
in
conduct
and
what
you
know
to
be
the
variant
and
capricious
nature
of
confidential
information?
that
isn't
to
be
presumed
that
it's
not
to
be
by
that
method
of
caprice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
waiting
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
a
judge
exercises
the
power
of
suspension,
except
when
the
standard
--
when
the
specific
procedure
is
formulated,
it
is
left
to
his
individual
private
secret
talk
in
--
in
his
chambers
with
or
without
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
point
is
when
you
do
have
probation
status
or
parole
status
such
as
maybe
suggested
by
the
madison
law
institute
in
its
proposed
code,
then
you
have
to
construe
those
standards
and
that's
what
the
attorney
general
is
telling
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
may
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
undermine
the
scheme
that
he's
setup.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
put
to
you
a
hypothetical
case
(inaudible)
i
think.
suppose
somebody
was
capable
--
suppose
somebody
on
information
and
belief
is
ready
to
prove
that
the
instance
in
confidential
information
and
this
fellow
(inaudible)
says
that
it
is
a
very
vigorous
and
belligerent
and
it
would
free
the
disturbing
(inaudible)
impression
of
that
in
one
way
or
the
other,
at
the
last
presidential
election
against
the
president
of
the
united
states.
suppose
you're
ready
to
prove
that,
would
you
say
it
can
be
allowed
and
that's
why
the
attorney
general
exercises
discretion
the
way
he
did,
would
you
think
that
result
from
the
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
--
he
could
then
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
a
petition
to
put
it
--
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

statement.
i'm
assuming,
the
fellow
is
about
to
be
deported,
he
denied
the
suspension,
he
files
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
which
he's
ready
to
prove
that
the
only
matter
in
the
file
of
a
confidential
nature
where
he
has
made
various
activities
to
complete
politically
for
the
opposing
party
in
1950
or
was
it
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
--
could
he
be
allowed
--
would
you
allow
him
to
prove
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
how
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
--
i
have
to
take
your
word
for
it
with
every
respect
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
taking
a
case
where
suspension
had
been
denied
because
the
deportee
was
a
mischievous
active
campaigner
against
--
a
successfully
mischievous
active
campaigner
in
his
district
against
the
present
president
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
of
all
the
caprice
that
you
say
limits
the
attorney
general
could
in
fact
have
moved
him
and
exclusively
moved
him
but
you
can't
establish
that
he
did
exercise
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
it
to
your
(inaudible)
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
need
not
hold
a
hearing,
it
doesn't
mean
if
he
does
hold
a
hearing,
he
can
be
capricious
in
doing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
can
the
attorney
general
withdraw
the
hearing
procedure
in
a
particular
case
and
restore
it
in
the
next
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
a
particular
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
on
a
particular
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
he
had
a
hearing
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
a
particular
case
which
came
before
him
but
he
abolished
it
to
the
--
the
day
before
the
hearing.
is
that
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
mr.
lindsay,
ab
initio
he
didn't
held
any
hearing.
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
point
for
which
i
agree
with
you
is
that
under
the
statute,
the
attorney
general
can
act
without
any
over
procedure
at
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you.
i
do
not
agree
with
you
that
therefore
since
he
could
--
that
therefore
a
part
is
better
than
nothing,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
it
doesn't
follow
it.
let's
not
withdraw,
may
be
he
could
(inaudible)
justice
felix

you
mean
an
oral
hearing?
you
mean
an

--
justice
felix

230.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
take
care
of
the
problem.
