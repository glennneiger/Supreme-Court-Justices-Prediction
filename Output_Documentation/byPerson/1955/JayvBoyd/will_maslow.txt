mr.
will
maslow
if
the
court
please,
this
case
is
hereby
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
had
affirmed
a
district
court
refusal
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
alien
petitioner
here
had
sort
by
that
writs
to
review
an
order
of
the
immigration
service
which
had
directed
his
deportation
and
simultaneously
had
denied
his
application
for
suspension.
the
alien,
however,
no
longer
contest
his
deportability
and
the
sole
issue,
therefore,
before
this
court,
is
whether
the
attorney
general
has
lawfully
denied
the
alien's
application
for
this
discretionary
relief.
the
alien
as
a
british
subject,
65
years
old,
who
has
lived
in
this
country
continuously
since
1921,
a
period
of
35
years,
he
was
ordered
deported
in
1951
because
he
admittedly
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
united
states
from
1935
to
1941.
at
that
time,
the
alien
was
not
eligible
for
the
discretionary
relief
of
suspension.
however,
in
1952,
the
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
for
the
first
time,
allowed
the
attorney
general
to
suspend
the
deportation
of
those
found
guilty
of
having
been
past
members
of
the
communist
party.
accordingly,
the
alien
petitioned
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
withdraw
the
order
of
deportation,
to
reopen
the
deportation
hearing
and
to
consider
his
application
for
suspension.
that
was
done,
and
in
1953,
the
reopen
hearing
began.
now,
at
that
time,
to
qualify
under
the
statute
for
this
discretionary
relief,
four
conditions
had
to
be
met.
first,
the
alien
had
to
show
that
he
had
been
continuously
a
resident
of
united
states
for
the
last
10
years.
secondly,
he
had
to
show
that
he
had
been
a
good
moral
character
during
that
period.
thirdly,
he
had
to
show
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
the
deportation
would
result
an
exceptional
and
extremely
unusual
hardship
to
him
or
to
his
family.
and
fourthly,
the
--
no
final
order
of
deportation
could
be
in
effect
to
qualify
him
for
this
discretionary
relief.
the
attorney
general
who
was
given
the
statutory
power
to
suspend
deportation
has
delegated
it
by
regulation
to
a
core
of
officers
in
the
immigration
service
known
as
special
inquiry
officers.
and
he
has
likewise
prescribed
most
precisely
the
hearing
procedure
to
pass
upon
these
claims.
the
special
inquiry
officer
therefore
who
heard
this
alien's
application
in
1953
found
specifically
that
the
alien
had
met
all
of
the
statutory
qualifications.
indeed,
he
found
in
addition
that
the
alien
had
not
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
since
1940.
and
then
his
opinion
goes
on
to
state
and
i
quote
all
of
the
opinion,
it's
just
two
sentences
and
it
maybe
found
at
page
48
of
the
record.
this
is
the
language
of
the
special
officer,
“however,
after
considering
confidential
information
relating
to
the
respondent,
as
is
provided
for
under
8
cfr
244.3,
it
is
concluded
that
the
respondent's
case
does
not
warrant
favorable
action
and
that
his
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
should
be
denied.”
there
is
nothing
further
in
the
opinion
about
it
nor
is
there
any
reference
--
was
there
any
reference
in
the
hearing
to
any
confidential
information.
at
this
reopened
hearing,
the
only
witnesses
called
were
those
called
by
the
alien,
the
government
made
no
effort
to
introduce
any
evidence
that
in
any
ways
derogatory
to
the
alien.
and
as
far
as
anyone
can
tell,
by
looking
at
the
record,
there
is
nothing
there
to
justify
the
denial
of
his
application.
mr.
will
maslow
nothing,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
government
introduced
at
this
hearing,
an
fbi
investigative
report.
that
report
discloses
nothing
derogatory
to
the
alien.
he'd
simply
gave
his
fingerprints,
lack
of
criminal
record,
his
alien
registration
number
and
so
on.
when
the
alien
--
when
the
alien's
application
for
a
suspension
was
denied,
he
appealed
as
he
had
a
legal
right
to
do
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
that
board
dismissed
his
appeal
explicitly
resting
their
dismissal
on
this
regulation,
244.3.
thereafter,
he
made
the
same
contention
in
the
district
court,
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
each
of
this
likewise
dismissed
his
appeal
and
explicitly
upheld
the
validity
of
regulation
244.3.
that
regulation,
your
honors,
may
be
found
at
page
61
of
the
government
brief.
the
crucial
case
--
mr.
will
maslow
the
crucial
--
yes,
your
honor.
the
crucial
case
--
the
crucial
question
on
this
case
therefore
is
whether
the
attorney
general,
having
on
the
one
hand
by
regulation,
directed
that
a
hearing
should
be
conducted
to
pass
upon
an
alien's
application
for
suspension,
may
on
the
other
hand,
vitiate
that
hearing
by
authorizing
his
subordinates
to
deny
such
relief
to
an
alien
admittedly
eligible
and
qualify
for
it
solely
on
the
basis
of
confidential
information,
not
of
record,
and
which
is
not
disclosed
to
the
alien.
incidentally,
i
might
say
that
in
the
first
accardi
case,
mr.
justice
clark
in
footnote
number
5
stated
that
that
was
not
the
issue
before
the
court
in
the
accardi
case,
namely,
the
validity
of
this
regulation
authorizing
the
nondisclosure
of
non-record
information.
now,
the
alien,
in
this
proceeding,
makes
three
contentions.
we
contend,
first
of
all,
that
the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
attorney
general
was
not
authorized
by
congress
and
is
therefore
invalid.
secondly,
we
contend
that
even
assuming
that
the
regulation
is
valid,
it
is
inconsistent
with
other
regulations
promulgated
by
the
attorney
general
and
inconsistent
with
other
provisions
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
and
that
this
court
must
therefore
reconcile
these
inconsistencies
by
directing
that
a
fair
resume
of
the
confidential
information
be
disclosed
to
the
alien.
this
is
what
this
court
ordered
in
the
selective
service
cases
beginning
with
united
states
against
nugent,
simmons
against
united
states.
my
associate,
mr.
caughlan,
will
argue
the
second
point.
now,
independently,
appoints
one
and
two
--
mr.
will
maslow
no,
sir
he
did
not.
he
was
no
position
to
ask
for
a
resume
because
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
he
did
not
know
that
confidential
information
would
be
used
against
him.
mr.
will
maslow
no,
sir
he
did
not.
now,
independently
of
these
two
points,
our
third
contention
is
that
in
violation
of
an
explicit
regulation
of
the
attorney
general,
which
as
you
know,
has
the
effective
law
and
is
binding
upon
the
service,
and
in
effect,
spells
out
the
alien's
rights.
the
special
inquiry
officer
has
failed
to
state
the
reasons
for
denying
the
application
for
a
suspension.
now,
there
is
a
specific
regulation
that
makes
that
requirement
and
that
regulation
is
likewise
found
in
the
appendix
to
the
government
brief,
its
regulation
242.618.
my
associate,
mr.
caughlan,
will
--
has
argued
the
third
point.
now,
before
i
address
myself
to
the
first
point,
namely,
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
i
think
it's
essential
to
describe
the
process
by
which
the
immigration
service
passes
upon
this
applications.
the
service
has,
in
the
last
five
years,
deported
an
average
of
20,000
persons
a
year,
and
that
figure,
your
honors,
is
exclusive
of
the
so-called
mexican
wetbacks,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
home
are
expelled
without
formal
procedures.
and
even
larger
number
of
hearings
is
held
each
year
and
our
brief
cites
a
letter
from
an
assistant
commissioner
of
immigration
that
there
are
--
there
was
in
the
last
fiscal
year,
35,00
of
these
deportation
hearings.
in
forfeit
of
these
hearings,
deportation
is
not
an
issue
so
that
you
have
perhaps
20,000
hearings
a
year
in
which
the
sole
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
order
of
deportation
shall
be
suspended.
incidentally,
the
term
suspended
is
a
word
of
art
because
if
suspension
is
actually
granted,
the
deportation
proceeding
is
canceled
and
the
alien's
right
to
remain
in
this
country
is
legalized.
now,
to
deal
with
these
mass
of
applications,
the
attorney
general,
as
by
regulation
prescribed
a
hearing
procedure.
first
of
all,
he
is
--
the
regulations
provide
--
these
regulations
are
all
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae.
regulations
provide
that
the
application
for
a
suspension
can
only
be
made
during
the
hearing.
in
fact,
this
is
almost
a
statutory
requirement
because
until
the
deportation
--
if
a
deportation
order
is
outstanding,
the
alien
is
not
qualified
under
the
statute,
and
therefore,
the
deportation
order
must
be
set
aside
as
was
done
in
the
case
at
bar,
or
else
--
and
that
is
the
common
procedure.
in
one
hearing,
the
special
inquiry
officer
disposes
of
the
question
of
deportability
and
the
second
question
of
whether
suspension
shall
be
granted
and
the
service
encourages
this
because
it
does
not
want
to
have
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
having
two
hearings.
now,
the
hearing
whose
incidents
are
described
in
regulation
24.2
in
the
government's
--
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
is
a
formal
one.
the
term
hearing,
incidentally,
is
in
the
regulation
itself.
there
is
a
regulation
that
specifically
says
that
this
shall
be
called
a
hearing.
the
alien
is
represented
by
counsel,
witnesses
are
sworn,
they
are
examined
and
cross-examined,
the
exhibits
are
put
to
the
record,
a
transcript
is
kept,
there
is,
in
other
words,
all
of
the
indicia
of
what
we
know
as
an
administrative
hearing.
following
the
hearing,
the
regulations
require
the
special
inquiry
officer
to
hand
down
a
written
decision.
in
that
decision,
according
to
regulations,
he
must
dispose
of
the
issue
of
deportability.
then
the
regulations
provide
that
if
the
alien
has
made
an
application
for
suspension
that
his
decision
shall
contain,
and
here
i
quote
again
from
the
regulation
appearing
at
government's
brief
page
60,
his
decision
shall
contain,
"a
discussion
of
the
evidence
relating
to
the
alien's
eligibility
for
relief
and
the
reasons
for
granting
or
denying
such
application."
then
he
issues
an
order
which
specifies
whether
or
not
the
alien
shall
be
deported
and
whether
or
not
suspension
shall
be
granted.
it
is
unlike
the
practice
that
existed
in
1947,
for
example,
where
the
hearing
officer
may
have
made
recommendations.
he
has
the
authority
to
issue
the
order.
the
order
of
the
special
officer
is
final
unless
he
decides
it
takes
an
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
appeal
may
be
taken
from
the
order
of
deportability
for
the
order
granting
or
declining
suspension.
each
side
has
an
appeal.
the
alien,
thereafter,
has
no
further
administrative
rights
of
appeal
although
the
service
thus.
the
service
may
appeal
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
attorney
general
as
on
motion
may
review
and
reverse
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
although,
this
is
the
power
which
he
rarely
exercise.
now,
if
the
attorney
general
allows
the
order
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
stand,
the
suspension
order
is
still
not
effective.
he
is
required
by
section
244
(c)
of
the
act
just
likewise
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief
to
report
the
action
taken
to
congress.
and
the
statute
provides
that
each
case
to
which
suspension
is
granted
by
the
attorney
general
that
he
must
furnished
congress,
and
i
quote,
"a
complete
and
detailed
statement
of
the
facts
in
pertinent
provisions
of
law
in
the
case
with
the
reasons
for
such
suspension."
the
congress
then
has
two
alternatives.
it
may,
by
affirmative
resolution,
agree
with
the
attorney
general,
in
which
case,
the
proceedings
of
counsel
that
his
stay
is
legalized
or
it
may
disapprove.
if
it
fails
to
approve,
the
alien
must
depart
from
this
country.
mr.
will
maslow
well,
your
honor,
it's
only
one
hearing.
if
the
hearing
which
there
are
two
issues,
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
deportability
and
in
hearing
on
the
issue
of
suspension.
mr.
will
maslow
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
regulations
prescribed
that
the
very
beginning
of
the
hearing
before
the
witness
as
even
before
the
alien
has
--
they
even
put
on
every
evidence,
the
regulations
prescribed
that
the
special
officer
shall
advice
the
alien
of
his
right
to
this
application.
and
then
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
officer
of
the
order
in
which
the
proof
is
taken.
now,
the
nub
of
this
case
therefore
is
regulation
244.3
which
empowers
these
special
officers
aboard
in
the
case
of
any
alien
qualified
for
suspension
to
grant
or
denies
such
relief
on
the
basis
of
confidential
information.
without
disclosing
it
to
the
alien,
it's
in
the
opinion
of
the
special
officer
or
of
the
board,
with
that
determinations
made
on
appeal,
such
disclosure
would
be
prejudicial
to
public
interest
safety
or
security.
your
honors
will
note
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
special
inquiry
officer
consult
with
anyone
into
the
department
before
he
labels
these
materials
confidential.
there
is
no
regulation
that
prescribes
any
procedure
whereby
his
actions
can
be
reviewed.
he
is
not
required
to
consult
with
security
officers
of
the
government.
he
does
this
entirely
on
his
own.
the
court
will
also
note
that
this
regulation,
244.3,
is
not
limited
to
cases
involving
subversives,
who
are
a
very
tiny
percentage
of
all
of
the
aliens
ordered
deported.
mr.
will
maslow
in
90%
of
the
cases,
your
honor,
the
predominant
cause
is
an
illegal
entry.
the
remaining
cases
--
mr.
will
maslow
it's
an
illegal
entry
but
first
--
mr.
will
maslow
well,
under
this
regulation
--
mr.
will
maslow
i'm
trying
to
answer
it,
your
honor,
but
i
want
to
understand
the
question
first.
in
the
--
if
an
alien
sneaks
across
the
border
or
it
doesn't
appear
for
inspection
or
has
a
made
a
fraudulent
representation
or
was
in
a
category
that
was
excludable.
mr.
will
maslow
at
least
90%.
mr.
will
maslow
you'll
find
that
information
in
my
article
in
the
current
issue.
mr.
will
maslow
90%.
mr.
will
maslow
90%,
it
varies
slightly
to
--
mr.
will
maslow
90%
of
the
total
deportations
are
due
to
illegal
entry.
mr.
will
maslow
it's
hard
to
tell
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
how
anyone
could
answer
it.
mr.
will
maslow
well,
that's
only
a
very
tiny
percentage.
mr.
will
maslow
now,
these
words
in
the
regulation,
244.3,
have
a
very
awesome
sound
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest
safety
and
security
but
in
practice,
the
special
officers
of
the
service
are
not
prestigious
about
the
type
of
material
that
they
label
as
confidential.
i
say
that
on
the
authority
of
a
reports
of
the
house
committee
on
government
operations
which
is
cited
on
the
brief
of
amicus,
which
made
an
intensive
study
of
the
operations
of
one
particular
suspension
case.
but
in
that
study,
they
examined
under
oath
a
great
many
officials
of
the
service
including
the
assistant
commissioner
in
charge
of
investigation.
in
that
reports,
and
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
reveals
that
without
question,
there
are
two
types
of
confidential
information.
there's
the
classified
type
and
there's
the
non-classified.
i
think
particularly
revealing
are
the
descriptions
under
oath
given
by
various
levels
of
authority
as
to
what
is
confidential
information.
one
investigator
testified
that
it
was
merely
information
we
received
off
the
street.
a
special
inquiry
officer
testified,
"what
might
be
termed
hearsay
evidence
which
could
not
be
gotten
in
the
record."
a
third
said
there
was
said
--
it
--
it
was
evidence
that
came
from
witnesses
whose
names
at
service
that
i
want
to
disclose.
and
finally,
this
--
the
assistant
chief
himself
in
the
describing
confidential
information
within
the
meaning
of
this
regulation
says
they'd
included
such
things
as
income
tax
reports.
now,
this
is
not
merely
occasional
aberration
or
a
violation
of
the
regulation
by
one
or
more
officers
because
the
investigator's
manual,
which
was
revealed
that
a
confidential
document
but
whose
existence
was
revealed
by
this
house
committee
goes
on
to
instruct
the
investigators
that
they
shall
make
a
report
of
information
offered
by
adverse
witnesses
unwilling
to
testify
and
recite
bluntly
that
this
report,
"though
not
made
a
part
of
the
hearing
record
will
be
considered
in
making
a
decision
on
the
case."
this
is
what
special
inquiry
--
this
is
what
confidential
information
means
in
practice
and
not
in
the
words
of
the
regulation.
mr.
will
maslow
no,
sir
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
constitution.
mr.
will
maslow
i
must
point
out,
your
honor,
however,
that
where
the
special
inquiry
officers
sit
alone
in
the
case
until
very
recently
he
did
so.
he
has
access
to
the
confidential
information
on
the
suspension
portion
of
the
case,
but
he
also
has
to
decide
the
deportation
portion
of
the
case
and
he
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
shield
his
mind
from
the
prejudicial
material
which
is
not
of
record
and
not
disclosed
to
the
alien,
so
that
it's
possible
for
the
special
officers
--
mr.
will
maslow
it's
not
an
issue
here
because
here
deportability
is
submitted,
but
the
regulation,
which
we
challenged,
makes
it
possible
for
the
special
officer
who
has
to
decide
deportability
also
with
the
same
material
that's
very
prejudicial
to
the
aid.
now,
regulation
244.3
is
certainly
not
indispensable
to
the
administration
of
the
act
because
from
1940
to
1952,
there
was
no
such
regulation.
the
government
brief
cites
an
intensive
study
of
the
immigration
law
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
1950
that
led
to
the
codification
of
this
act.
there
is
one
line
in
that
925
page
reports
that
in
any
way
relates
to
confidential
information
in
suspension
cases.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act,
there
is
nothing
in
the
congressional
--
in
the
reports
of
the
congressional
committees,
nor
was
i
able
to
find
the
single
line
in
a
congressional
debate
that
went
on
for
weeks.
and
i
suspect
that
the
government
was
not
able
to
either
because
they
didn't
cite
it
although
they
cite
it
in
many
other
things
in
their
brief.
now,
it
will
be
noted
that
regulation
244.3
allows
this
special
officer
to
grant
as
well
as
to
deny
an
application
on
the
basis
of
confidential
information,
but
if
he
does
so,
that
special
officer
would
have
a
hard
job
complying
with
the
statutory
mandates
that
the
case
of
suspension
that
a
complete
and
detailed
statement
of
the
facts
must
be
reported
to
congress
together
with
the
reasons
for
granting
suspension.
congress
wanted
a
complete
report
and
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
would
allow
the
attorney
general
to
withhold
the
information
from
it
since
it
is
the
final
authority
in
passing
upon
the
suspension
cases
upon
the
attorney
general's
claim
that
confidential
information
was
involved.
my
associate
will
argue
the
points
(inaudible)
mr.
will
maslow
well,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing,
sir,
whether
there
is
any
case
in
which
the
confidential
information
has
been
reported
to
congress
or
has
not
been.
mr.
will
maslow
well,
they
are
not
confidential
by
statutes,
but
they
are
not
public
documents.
they
are
reported
to
the
immigration
committee,
but
they're
not
printed
in
the
congressional
record
or
otherwise.
mr.
will
maslow
there's
no
report
required.
now,
when
congress
--
the
congress
that
enacted
the
mccarran-walter
act,
it
was
familiar
with
the
problems
of
confidential
information
because
there
is
one
section
of
the
act
where
it's
authorized.
that's
235
(c)
but
it
relates
to
exclusion
of
immigrant
aliens.
a
class,
which
this
court
has
said,
the
congress
has
almost
plenary
power
over,
and
there,
there
are
many
distinctions
and
the
--
the
regulation
itself
is
carefully
limited
so
that
the
before
the
attorney
general
may
use
his
confidential
information
in
the
inclusion
cases,
he
is
required
to
consult
with
appropriate
security
agencies.
mr.
will
maslow
he
suspended
an
average
of
4000
a
year.
mr.
will
maslow
well,
it's
made
publicly
in
the
sense
that
the
congressional
record
reports
that
a
communication
was
received
from
the
attorney
general.
i
say
it's
not
made
a
public
document.
mr.
will
maslow
that's
all.
mr.
will
maslow
no
less
than
nothing.
it
merely
gives
the
date
of
the
report.
mr.
will
maslow
no.
mr.
will
maslow
no,
sir.
i
don't
mean
that
at
all
term.
mr.
will
maslow
i
don't
know,
sir,
because
that
document
is
not
a
public
document.
i
don't
know
whether
anyone
would
be
free
to
examine
that
document.
mr.
will
maslow
oh
i
can't
--
i
can't
say
that.
mr.
will
maslow
but
i
note
--
mr.
will
maslow
yes,
but
the
house
--
the
house
immigration
subcommittees
and
the
staff
of
those
subcommittees
do
have
a
complete
file
with
the
reasons
and
so
on,
whether
--
mr.
will
maslow
it
is
--
mr.
will
maslow
that
is
the
actual
practice
as
i
understand
it,
sir.
mr.
will
maslow
i'd
like
to
address
myself,
your
honors,
to
two
points.
first,
the
meaning
of
section
235
(c)
and
second
the
claimed
analogy
between
the
power
to
suspend
and
the
power
to
pardon.
section
235
(c)
relates
to
the
exclusion
of
immigrants
aliens.
that
is
the
class
which
for
all
practical
purposes
has
no
rights
under
the
constitution.
this
class
here
is
not
a
deportee.
it's
an
alien
who
is
deportable
because
under
the
statute
suspension
cannot
be
granted
if
a
final
order
of
deportation
has
been
issued.
at
the
moment,
therefore,
when
his
application
is
considered,
he's
not
a
deportee,
he's
a
person
against
whom
a
deportation
proceeding
is
pending.
now,
when
congress
authorized
the
use
of
confidential
information
and
by
the
way
this
court
has
not
yet
upheld
that
use
and
knauff
and
mezei
cases
dealt
with
the
war
time
or
emergency
statute.
section
235
(c)
is
the
statute
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
emergencies.
but
assuming
that
235
(c)
is
valid,
congress
said,
"you
don't
have
to
give
him
a
hearing
if
you
use
confidential
information,"
because
it
recognized
that
you
can't
have
both
concepts,
a
hearing
and
confidential
information.
mr.
lindsay
has
said
that
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
none.
i
think
that
the
half
a
loaf
is
poisoned,
it
is
not
better
than
none.
the
alien
who
comes
to
the
hearing,
thinking
that
he
is
getting
a
right
of
some
kind
and
as
said
walks
into
a
snare,
he's
no
better
off
and
that
there
were
no
hearing
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
may
be
worst
off.
now,
as
to
the
analogy
to
pardon,
the
action
of
a
president
in
refusing
to
issue
a
pardon
is
absolutely
non-reviewable,
no
matter
how
arbitrary
it
is.
the
acts
of
the
president
or
those
of
an
independent
branch
of
the
government
and
this
court
cannot
review
them.
but
this
court
can
review
and
the
government
has
conceded
that
this
court
can
review
a
manifest
abuse
of
discretion
by
an
attorney
general
and
there
are
cases
where
the
lower
courts
have
made
this
reversal.
i
want
to
point
out
other
distinctions
in
the
pardoning
power.
the
pardoning
power,
unlike
the
power
here,
is
not
divided
among
the
whole
hierarchy
with
a
special
officer,
board
of
immigration
appeals,
the
attorney
general
and
congress,
it's
the
act
of
a
single
man
who
in
private,
according
to
his
own
conscience,
decides
to
act.
secondly,
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
the
power
to
review
the
two.
now,
mr.
lindsay
was
asked
by
several
members
of
the
court
as
to
where
the
judges
--
where
the
attorney
general's
discretion
ends
and
the
government's
brief
concedes
that
where
it
appears
in
someway
that
there's
been
abuse
of
discretion,
this
court
can
review
them.
now,
it
doesn't
have
to
appear
on
the
record
if
we
can
show
by
independent
means
that
the
attorney
general
has
been
bribed
or
is
corrupt
or
is
actuated
by
racial
or
religious
prejudice,
the
court
would
still
review
it
whether
it
appeared
on
the
record
or
in
his
decision.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
as
well
that
this
court
in
mcgrath
against
kristensen
stated
that
the
alien
had
a
legal
right
to
be
considered
for
suspension.
that's
the
right
that
granted
him
by
the
regulations.
that's
a
far
different
situation
from
the
criminal
--
convicted
criminal,
who
as
of
matter
of
grace,
entreats
the
president
to
pardon
him.
he
has
no
rights
at
all.
this
alien
has
a
right
to
be
considered.
and
in
the
mcgrath
case,
this
court
reversed
the
attorney
general
when
he
found
that
the
alien
was
not
eligible
for
it.
i'd
like
also
to
quote,
because
i
think
the
language
is
apt,
the
paragraph
from
a
decision
in
this
circuit
--
in
this
district,
the
decision
of
judge
morris
involving
the
use
of
confidential
information.
he
said
there
is
no
place
in
this
government
for
arbitrary
actions
and
there
is
no
way
to
know
whether
such
action
is
arbitrary
or
not,
unless
the
basis
upon
which
it
is
taken
is
revealed.
if
--
when
congress
gave
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
act
in
his
discretion,
it
didn't
intend
that
he
would
have
an
absolute
and
limitless
power.
the
term
discretion
is
a
word
that
means
implicit
in
it
that
the
discretion
will
not
be
arbitrary.
thank
you.
