justice
john
m.
harlan
was
anything
said
at
the
hearing
that
indicated
that
this
confidential
information
was
going
to
be
relied
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
alien
asked
for
a
resume
following
the
coming
down
of
this
sentence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
after
the
report,
did
he
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
enlighten
me
in
my
ignorance
on
one
thing,
these
regulations
that
refer
to
the
hearings
on
the
back
of
the
government's
brief,
are
those
the
deportation
hearings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
you
have
to
make
your
application
for
a
suspension
continued
upon
an
adverse
order
of
deportation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
regulation
that
permits
the
use
of
confidential
information
to
the
deportation
proceedings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
limited
to
these
suspension
proceedings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
an
issue
--
that
issue
isn't
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
attorney
general
could
exercise
his
suspension
powers
about
reporting
in
hearing
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
substitution
rejection?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
to
reconcile
on
another
way,
can't
you
manage
to
say
that
the
requirement
of
a
hearing
bear
or
otherwise
is
not
an
element
of
this
discretionary
branch
of
the
deportation
proceedings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
if
that's
so
clear
as
you
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
doesn't
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
these
all
get
back,
mr.
lindsay,
to
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
has
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
give
no
hearing
or
any
kind
of
a
hearing
that
he
wants
to
give.
and
your
point
is,
i
take
it,
that
congress
has
left
it
to
his
discretion.
he
didn't'
have
to
set
up
any
kind
of
a
hearing,
having
set
up
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
he
has
set
up,
the
--
the
only
questions
is
the
--
the
administrative
due
process
has
been
followed
and
not
procedural
due
process,
isn't
that
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
following
the
regulations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
see
the
benefit
the
statute
provides.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
suggest
to
you
that
when
you
back
away
from
the
proposition
that
congress
gave
absolute
power
to
the
attorney
general,
you're
getting
into
dangerous
quagmire.
