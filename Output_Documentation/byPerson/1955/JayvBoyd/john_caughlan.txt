mr.
john
caughlan
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
point
which
petitioner
wishes
to
make
at
this
time
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
prescribed
two
regulations
or
two
sets
of
regulations
which
both
require
a
fair
hearing
and
which
permit
the
use
of
confidential
information
that
these
two
inconsistent
regulations
can
be
reconciled
only
by
requiring
that
a
fair
summary
of
the
confidential
information
contained
in
--
the
confidential
information
used
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
shall
be
furnished
to
the
applicant.
now,
this
portion
of
the
argument
assumes
that
the
regulation
244.3,
the
regulation
which
--
which
permits
the
use
of
confidential
information
is
a
valid
regulation.
there
is
no
requirement
specifically,
of
course,
in
the
statute
in
section
244,
the
immigration
act,
providing
for
suspension
of
deportation
that
any
hearing
or
any
specific
type
of
procedure
be
filed
by
the
attorney
general
in
determining
a
suspension
of
deportation
application.
however,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
mr.
meslow,
suspension
of
deportation
has
been
a
very
important
part
of
the
congressional
scheme
with
reference
to
immigration
nationality
and
--
with
reference
to
immigration,
since
the
first
enactment
of
a
statute
providing
for
suspension
in
1940.
mr.
john
caughlan
insofar
as
the
statute
indicates
and
so
far
as
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general,
if
he
saw
fit
to
do
so,
could
simply
eliminate
any
hearing
at
all.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
--
i
don't
think
we
reach
that
position
in
this
case.
now,
we're
not
contending
that
due
process
would
necessarily
be
violated
in
failing
to
grant
a
--
in
failing
to
grant
a
hearing
on
suspension.
the
fact
is,
of
course,
that
the
attorney
general
has
from
the
first
instance
in
which
congress
pass
a
suspension
statute,
sir,
has
required
--
has
authorized
and
is
directed
some
kind
of
hearing
on
suspension.
our
position
here
is
that
having
directed
a
hearing
and
under
the
current
statute
which
is
referred
to
on
page
23
of
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
american-jewish
congress,
under
the
current
statute
the
hearing
specifically
referred
to
--
that's
at
the
top
of
page
23,
8
cfr
242.53
specifically
provides
that
the
special
inquiry
officer
conduct
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing.
now,
this
requirement
for
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
is
a
requirement
which
is
set
forth
to
some
detail,
the
method
in
which
the
hearing
should
be
conducted
and
it's
requiring
that
was
discussed,
the
requirement
that
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
first
accardi
case.
the
requirement
for
a
fair
hearing
was
involved
there
in
a
suspension
case
at
that
--
in
that
case
it
was
at
the
second
state
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
but
the
court
stated
that,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
clark
and
the
majority
of
the
court,
that
the
board
must
exercise
its
own
independent
discretion
after
a
fair
hearing
which
is
nothing
more
than
the
regulations
accord
the
petitioner
as
a
matter
of
right.
then
the
opinion
goes
on
to
say
that
the
attorney
--
that
the
petitioner
may
still
fail
to
convince
the
board
or
the
attorney
general
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion
that
he
is
entitled
to
suspension,
but
at
least
he
will
have
been
afforded
that
due
process
required
by
the
regulations
in
such
proceedings.
mr.
john
caughlan
precisely,
precisely,
if
he
prescribes
a
hearing
as
he
has
done,
it
must
be
a
fair
hearing
and
we
take
the
position
that
that
--
and
we
believe
that
that
is
the
position
which
was
taken
by
this
court
in
the
accardi
case.
we
here
have
a
--
a
situation
where
he
has
specifically,
and
in
so
many
words,
prescribed
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing.
now,
then
we
come
to
regulation,
the
confidential
information
regulation
in
which
the
attorney
general
said,
"but
the
special
inquiry
officer
may
utterly
disregard
the
provisions
for
a
fair
hearing
and
he
may
base
his
decision
--
he
may
predicate
his
decision
on
information
which
is
not
disclosed
to
the
applicant
and
which
is
a
confidential
character."
what
could
be
more
unfair
than
to
provide
for
a
hearing
in
words
and
then
to
say
that
the
hearing
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
--
the
decision
that
you
remain,
that
the
decision
may
be
predicated
on
that
character
of
information
described
in
mr.
meslow's
argument,
namely,
information
got
off
the
street,
hearsay,
gossip
or
what
have
you.
now,
this
represents
what
appears
to
us
to
be
irreconcilable
conflict.
on
the
one
hand,
a
provision
for
a
fair
hearing,
on
the
other
hand,
a
provision
for
a
no
hearing.
mr.
john
caughlan
the
language
--
mr.
john
caughlan
to
--
to
which
i
refer
in
connection
with
--
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
not
--
unfortunately,
your
honor,
printed
in
full
in
the
--
in
either
the
government
or
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
language
is
contained
in
section
242
and
i
have
the
--
i
have
the
code
before
me
and
it
reads
as
follows.
the
special
inquiry
officer,
this
is
8
cfr
242.53
subparagraph
(b).
mr.
john
caughlan
8
cfr
242.53
subparagraph
(b),
reading
as
follows,
”the
special
inquiry
officer
shall
conduct
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing.”
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
on
the
--
the
whole
hearing
because
there
is
only
one
hearing.
now,
the
balance
of
that
section,
section
242
(c)
--
53
(c)
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
at
page
61
--
page
60,
and
that
--
that
provides
that
the
in
section
(d)
provide
specifically
for
the
consideration
of
matters
in
connection
with
suspension
of
deportation
so
that
the
regulation
that
i've
just
quoted
regarding
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing,
your
honor,
relates
to
the
whole
process,
the
deportation,
the
question
of
deportability,
and
the
question
sent
of
suspension
of
deportation.
the
two
are
not
separate
in
the
--
mr.
john
caughlan
it
says
so
right
in
the
--
in
the
regulation,
if
the
court
--
if
your
honor
please.
section
242
(a)
--
section
242.53
(a)
relates
to
the
--
the
conduct
of
the
hearing,
(b)
that
i
refer
to
relates
to
the
--
comparing
on
the
fair
and
impartial
hearing
and
the
section
(c)
relates
to
the
order
of
evidence
providing
that
--
not
the
order
of
evidence
but
the
nature
of
the
evidence
requiring
that
the
special
inquiry
officer
shall
advice
the
alien
of
his
rights
that
he
shall
state
the
grounds
--
that
he
shall
have
the
right
to
present
evidence
on
the
grounds
of
deportation,
factors
bearing
on
response
as
eligibility,
and
such
other
matters
as
may
be
pertinent
in
the
issue
of
the
case.
so
that
if
one
regulation,
it
applies
to
one
hearing
and
that
one
hearing
relates
both
to
deportability
and
suspension.
the
application
has
been
made
at
the
suspension
hearing.
now,
it's
our
position
then
that
you
have
here
what's
black
on
the
one
side
and
what's
white
on
the
other,
that
this
can
be
reconciled
and
should
be
reconciled,
must
be
reconciled
only
by
the
--
the
procedure
formulated
by
this
court
in
consideration
of
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
in
the
nugent
case.
mr.
john
caughlan
that's
the
regulation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
that
is
regulation
242
--
244.3
and
that
appears
on
page
61
of
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief.
so
that
the
one
regulation
calls
for
a
fair
hearing,
the
other
regulation
calls
for
the
use
of
confidential
information
without
that
hearing.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
the
--
the
two
are
--
certainly
do
appear
--
appeared
to
be
inconsistent.
in
other
words,
he
has
apparently
taken
the
--
the
right
of
a
hearing
given
under
section
242
--
under
section
(b)
--
subsection
(b)
a
way
when
he
has
used
the
confidential
information
hearing.
mr.
john
caughlan
well
--
mr.
john
caughlan
if
he
had
placed
the
--
them
in
the
--
in
the
same
section,
in
section
242,
then
the
--
it
would
have
been
in
one
section,
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
john
caughlan
if
the
two
were
--
were
in
one
section,
well,
if
--
i
--
i
would
say
would
have
no
substantially
different
effect
if
the
two
were
included
in
one
section,
it
would
simply
emphasize
the
fact
that
a
--
that
some
reconciliation
would
have
to
be
made
between
the
provisions
of
one
portion
of
the
section
and
the
other
which
is
what
we
contend
for
here,
that
this
can
only
be
reconciled
by
requiring
some
summary,
not
the
source
of
the
information
but
some
fair
summary
of
the
information
of
some
resume,
of
the
information
that
was
involved
such
as
to
require
in
the
interpretation
of
the
universal
military
training
and
services
act.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
as
was
already
pointed
out
as
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
was
already
indicated
in
connection
with
that,
the
attorney
general
could
abolish
a
hearing.
he
has
chosen
a
procedure
of
having
here
and
it
is
--
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
we
believe
that
it
is
a
necessary
procedure
for
other
reasons
that
is
--
it's
that
--
it
is
necessary
in
carrying
out
the
intent
of
congress
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
upon
suspension.
it
--
it
isn't
simply
a
matter
of
something
that
the
attorney
general
--
that
there
must
be
some
provision
for
--
for
formulating
the
information.
now,
it's
our
position
then
that
the
nugent
case
represents
a
manner
in
which
these
two
can
be
reconciled.
our
third
point,
which
i
now
--
which
to
come
to,
is
that
regardless
of
whether
section
244.3
going
for
section
--
regulation
going
for
confidential
information
is
authorized
regardless
of
whether
this
court
should
require
in
reconciling
these
two
irreconcilable
provisions
that
the
confidential,
some
resume
of
the
confidential
information
be
framed
that
there's
another
reason
in
which
must
call
for
a
reversal
of
the
action
in
this
case.
now,
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
regulation
regarding
decisions
on
special
inquiry
officers
which
is
printed,
decisions
of
special
inquiry
officers
which
is
printed
on
page
60
of
the
government
brief.
this
regulation,
appearing
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
first
relates
to
what
shall
be
contained
in
a
decision
on
the
issue
of
deportability.
the
last
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
relates
to
the
issue
pertinent
here.
if
the
respondent
has
applied
for
discretionary
relief
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
242.54
(d),
the
decisions
shall
also
contain
a
discussion
of
the
evidence
relating
to
the
alien's
eligibility
for
a
relief
and
reasons
for
granting
or
denying
such
application.
now,
here
is
what
the
record
gave
as
to
reasons
for
granting
deportability.
this
appears
on
page
47
and
48
of
the
record.
on
page
47
and
the
top
of
page
48
in
the
very
short
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer,
which
consumes
only
two
pages
of
the
record,
there
is
contained
a
three
or
two
and
half
paragraph
summary
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
in
which
the
facts
concerning
the
petitioner
are
discussed.
the
facts
relating
to
that
he
has
shown
his
good
moral
character
is
the
extremely
unusual,
the
exceptionally,
extremely
unusual
hardship
which
we
call
him,
the
other
fact
is
relating
to
eligibility.
this
is
the
only
thing
else
in
the
record
regarding
which
relates
in
any
way
to
reasons
for
denial
of
suspension
of
deportability.
on
the
record
--
for
denial
of
suspension
of
deportation
--
on
the
record,
the
respondent
appears
to
be
qualified
for
suspension
of
deportation.
however,
after
considering
confidential
information
relating
to
the
respondent
as
this
is
provided
for
under
section
8
cfr
244.3,
it
is
concluded
that
the
respondent's
case
does
not
warrant
favorable
action
and
that
his
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
be
denied.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
this
is
not
a
statement
of
reasons
for
denying
suspension
of
deportation
and
i
don't
see
anyway
in
which
it
could
be
tortured
into
that.
this
is
a
statement
of
why
no
reasons
are
given
for
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
john
caughlan
a
question
was
raised
just
before
the
recess
as
to
whether
or
not
a
hearing
is
mandatory
under
section
244
of
the
act.
whether
or
not
a
hearing
is
mandatory,
we
submit
that
there
--
it
is
contrary
to
the
expressed
intent
of
congress
to
permit
the
use
of
confidential
information
in
connection
with
the
suspension
proceedings.
when
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
use
of
confidential
information,
it
had
no
difficulty
in
expressing
its
intent
unmistakably
as
witness
section
235
(c)
of
the
immigration
nationality
act,
which
is
referred
to
on
pages
37
and
38
of
the
government
brief,
which
relates
to
the
question
of
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
admission
and
that
is
on
the
exclusion
of
persons
applying
for
admission
and
congress
explicitly
stated
that
in
such
proceedings
without
any
inquiry
or
without
any
further
inquiry
by
a
special
inquiry
officer,
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
use
confidential
information
and
not
disclose
it
to
the
alien
applicant.
on
the
contrary,
as
is
already
been
pointed
out,
section
244
of
the
act
which
authorizes
suspension
of
deportation
specifically
requires
that
congress
be
furnished
a
--
with
the
reasons
that
suspension
of
deportation
is
granted.
the
regulation
challenge
here,
however,
without
differentiating
says
that
whether
it
is
granted
or
denied
--
whether
it
is
granted
or
denied
it
may
be
based
upon
confidential
information.
now,
this
violates
a
--
the
other
section
of
the
statute
which
is
--
the
other
section
of
regulations
which
we
contend
specifically
are
nullified
--
mr.
john
caughlan
--
by
the
use
of
confidential
--
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
regulation
which
is
here
challenged
--
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
true.
our
position
is
that
congress
did
not
authorize
the
use
of
confidential
information
and
the
language
of
section
244
(c)
which
requires
a
report
when
it
is
granted
indicates
that
in
such
cases,
certainly,
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
granting
should
be
based
upon
confidential
information.
that
is
it
didn't
intend
the
use
confidential
information
in
a
suspension
hearing
where
suspension
is
granted
because
if
confidential
information
is
used,
congress
isn't
being
given
the
reasons
that
the
suspension
is
granted.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
--
of
course
in
that
situation,
i
am
apart
from
the
question
of
congressional
intent
would
deprive
the
alien
of
any
right
of
appeal
which
is
specifically
granted
to
--
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
on
suspension
of
hearing,
he
has
that
specific
right
to
apply
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
under
section
--
under
the
regulation
6,
8
c.f.r.6.1,
he
has
the
right
to
appeal.
that
right
is
wiped
out.
mr.
john
caughlan
if
the
attorney
general
had
not
prescribed
any
procedure
for
appeal
at
all,
that
there
was
no
provision
whatsoever
--
mr.
john
caughlan
in
suspension
cases.
mr.
john
caughlan
if
this
was
exercised
without
any
right
of
--
of
appeal
or
any
other
regulations,
we'd
be
confronted
with
a
different
situation.
i
would
still
say
that
congress
hadn't
authorized
the
use
of
--
of
confidential
information.
i
don't
believe
that
that
can
be
found
in
the
act.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
that
confidential
information
should
be
used.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
that
--
that
--
mr.
justice
clark,
that
would
--
would
be
true
but
we
feel
while
the
due
process
issue
as
such
isn't
raised
here,
we
feel
that
congressional
intent
as
i've
just
outlined
has
indicated
that
the
attorney
general
wasn't
authorized
to
use
confidential
information.
mr.
john
caughlan
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
john
caughlan
but
his
regulation
of
course,
which
is
a
different
situation
indifferently,
permits
the
use
of
confidential
information
whether
he's
granting
or
denying
the
regulation.
mr.
john
caughlan
that's
a
question
that
frankly
puzzles
me
when
he
would
use
it.
it's
in
the
regulations
and
i
could
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
perhaps
he
would
want
to
grant
some
person,
who
on
the
record
would
appear
to
be
not
a
very
good
--
not
a
very
likely
prospect
for
some
--
mr.
john
caughlan
maybe
something
like
that,
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
john
caughlan
we'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time.
