what
is
the
language
to
which
you
refer
from
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
present
in
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
a
fair
hearing.
where
is
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
do
you
have
--
now
referred
to
242.53
(b)
implying
a
fair
and
partial
hearing,
is
that
the
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
another
regulation
which
provides
for
the
use
of
so-called
confidential
information.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he
had
the
right
to
promulgate
one
regulation,
would
he
--
or
not
have
the
right
to
promulgate
the
other
even
if
he
was
describing
required
things
that
any
people
might
not
think
were
consistent
with
the
fair
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
--
why
is
it
not
the
same
as
though
in
242
(b)
--
63
(b)
he
had
said
to
be
a
fair
hearing
except
to
the
extent
that
to
accept
that
the
--
and
maybe
offered
an
evidence
a
confidential
communication
without
letting
the
accused,
if
you
want
to
call
it
the
accused,
know
where
it
came
from.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
the
same
as
though
it's
all
been
in
one
just
like
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
--
would
not
and
it
had
been
the
same
as
though
it
is
now
as
were
to
be
in
a
different
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
the
limitation
you
put
on
it
unless
you
would
read
--
can
you
read
two
sentences
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
along
what
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
--
does
he
state
right
before
the
sentence
you
read
what
he
means
by
confidential
information,
they
didn't
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
five
words
you
use
that
and
it's
pretty
important
when
the
trial
is
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
meant
there
when
you
said
emphasize
and
not
going
to
the
question
of
eligibility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
that
the
--
the
deported
alien
that
have
been
declared
deportable
does
not
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
to
determine
his
eligibility?
i'm
not
talking
about
to
determine
the
question,
to
determine
his
eligibility.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
has
to
have,
doesn't
he,
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
he
can
prove.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
says
--
it
says
without
any
qualification
that
i
can
see
that
he,
an
alien,
can
be
allowed,
must
be
allowed
to
prove
these
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
suspend.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whatever
it
is
he
has
to
be
allowed
to
prove
it.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
could
--
that
should
carry
that
idea
to
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
point
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
you
for
this
reason,
if
the
statute,
that
it
seems
to
me,
give
him
a
right
to
prove
his
good
character
for
10
years
that
he's
been
here
for
10
years
and
then
the
other
conditions.
before
the
attorney
general
can
exercise
his
discretion,
he
has
a
right
to
prove
that
character.
then
how
could
the
attorney
general,
after
he
has
proven
good
character
and
a
hearing
because
that
would
after
imply
a
hearing
under
all
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
how
could
the
attorney
general,
after
it
was
established
by
hearing
by
the
congress
that
said
he
could
prove
it,
tear
it
down
by
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
his
character
was
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
kind
of
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
kind
of
hearing,
the
statute
usually
--
i
mean
the
court
has
always
interpreted
as
i
understand
it,
when
a
man
is
given
a
right
to
prove
something
that
means
he's
got
to
have
a
right
to
have
a
hearing,
some
kind
of
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
congress
has
given
a
status
to
a
deportee
to
this
extent,
it
has
said
that
he
can
be
allowed
to
prove
three
things
and
if
--
if
those
are
proven
then
he's
eligible
for
the
attorney
general
to
consider
in
his
discretion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
you
will
suspend
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
the
--
the
attorney
general,
as
i
see
it,
is
not
given
a
discretion
with
reference
to
these
three
matters,
they're
subject
to
prove
it
in
some
kind
of
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
if
the
alien
prove
it
then
he
can
call
on
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
his
discretion
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
would
work
in
unusual
hardship,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
you
would
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you'd
have
a
right
to
do
it,
to
exclude
him
then
but
could
he
exclude
him
on
the
basis
of
taking
new
evidence,
hearsay
evidence
as
to
the
matters
which
had
been
proven
in
the
hearing
to
wit
good
character?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
was
asking
which
maybe
--
which
may
not
be
appropriate
even
though
he
has
discretion,
does
he
have
discretion
to
deny
the
eligibility
or
to
deny
him
the
suspension
by
refusing
to
accept
the
previous
finding
that
settled
the
question
of
his
eligibility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
without
regulation,
i'm
talking
about
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
eligibility.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
proven,
how
then
can
--
proven
under
authority
of
congress,
under
a
statute,
how
then
can
the
attorney
general
refuse
to
regard
him
as
proven?
