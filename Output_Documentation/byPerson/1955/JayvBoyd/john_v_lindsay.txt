mr.
john
v.
lindsay
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
i
should
like
at
the
outset
to
correct
if
i
may
one
or
two
impressions
that
may
have
been
made
by
argument
of
counsel.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
reference
by
mr.
maslow
to
the
type
of
confidential
information
that
is
used
pursuant
to
regulation
244.3,
the
regulation
in
question
in
this
case.
and
the
first
--
first
reference
that
he
made
was
the
testimony
by
one
of
the
immigration
service
investigators
to
the
effect
that
"some
of
these
confidential
reports
were
merely
information
we
received
off
the
street."
i
wish
that
mr.
maslow
had
seen
fit
to
read
the
rest
of
that
paragraph
which
goes
as
follows
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he's
referring
--
this
refers
at
page
34
of
the
amicus'
brief
which
was
--
which
mr.
maslow
referred
to
orally
in
argument
prior
to
the
recess
and
he
was
describing
of
the
type
of
confidential
information
that
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
page
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
at
footnote
--
i
believe
it's
footnote
34
which
appears
that
page
12
of
the
brief
filed
by
the
american
jewish
congress.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
you
will
note
that
the
same
statement
appears
here
that
--
at
the
top
of
page
12,
a
service
investigator,
one
of
whose
functions
is
to
assist
the
special
inquiry
officer
in
preparing
a
case
for
hearing,
describe
such
confidential
material
as
"merely
information
we
received
off
the
street."
the
actual
quotation
has
another
sentence
added
to
it
which
reads
as
follows,
“in
the
matter
of
character
investigation,
we
wanted
nothing
along
those
lines.”
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
cited
in
any
of
the
government
papers
before
the
court.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i'll
be
glad
to
submit
--
i'll
be
glad
to
submit
a
reply
brief
to
the
amicus'
brief
which
will
clarify
this
particular
point,
if
the
chief
justice
wishes.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
they
would
be
contained
in
the
hearings
and
that's
where
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
and
--
and
that's
where
it's
found.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'll
read
the
two
sentences
together
as
they
appear
in
the
--
in
the
hearings.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
here's
--
here's
how
it
actually
appears
in
the
hearings,
“some
of
these
confidential
reports
were
merely
information
we
received
off
the
street.
in
the
matter
of
character
investigation,
we
wanted
nothing
along
those
lines
that
was
understood.”
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
received
--
along
the
lines
of
merely
information
received
off
the
street.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
my
--
the
--
the
point
that
i
was
--
that
i
was
making
at
the
outset
did
not
apply
to
the
--
the
instant
case
at
hand,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
what
i
was
referring
to
was
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
we
do
not
know
what
the
confidential
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
because
the
use
of
the
confidential
information
in
--
in
this
--
as
prescribed
by
the
regulation
244.3
is
limited
to
the
confidences
respected
only
in
cases
where
it's
necessary
to
protect
the
public
interest,
safety
or
security.
and
i
take
it
that
what
was
being
said
here
in
the
testimony
that
was
referred
to
by
mr.
maslow's
argument,
i
take
it
that
what
was
really
being
said
was
that
we
don't
consider
that
type
of
information,
the
type
of
information
that
is
--
that
is
included
within
the
scope
of
this
regulation.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
what
i
--
that
is
the
--
the
result
that
i
would
reach
from
reading
this
--
this
excerpt
which
was
partially
quoted
by
mr.
maslow.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
do
--
i
do
not
know.
i
would
imagine
that
in
most
cases
the
type
of
information
which
would
not
be
disclosed
would
be
information
of
the
security
nature.
in
most
cases
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
i
would
think
it
would
be
classified.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
would
not
think
that
they
would
use
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
was
--
i
was
quoting
from
the
testimony
of
the
--
the
service
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
before
the
hill
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
in
which
he
said
this,
in
which
the
chief
of
investigation
said
this,
"some
of
these
confidential
reports
were
merely
information
we
received
off
the
street.
in
the
matter
of
character
investigation,
we
wanted
nothing
along
those
lines
that
was
understood.”
in
other
words,
if
it
came
in
--
in
a
--
from
a
security
agency,
marked
confidential
and
it
contained
information
received
off
the
street,
it
would
not
be
used.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he
--
he
does
not.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
now,
secondly
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
the
usual
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
the
usual
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
correct
or
--
or
from
the
central
intelligence
agency.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
there
was
--
apparently
in
this
case
there
was
an
fbi
report
that
was
introduced
that
did
not
contain
security
information
or
did
not
contain
information
which
was
deemed
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
to
forward
in
the
scope
of
the
regulation.in
other
words,
necessary
to
keep
confidential.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
if
the
--
if
the
report
--
if
the
report
that
had
been
filed
--
if
the
information
which
the
special
inquiry
--
inquiry
officer
had
was
of
the
type
that
could
not
be
revealed,
it
would
not
be
--
it
would
not
be
revealed
to
the
alien.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
they
might.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
they
might.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
they
might.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
should
like
to
--
to
point
out,
however,
that
--
that
the
figures
for
last
year
of
the
cases
appealed
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
that
there
were
4000
deportation
cases
approximately.
now,
this
is
a
rough
estimate,
out
of
a
total
of
some
6000
cases
that
were
considered
by
the
board.
out
of
those
cases,
only
410%
involves
suspension.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
approximately
four-fifths
of
the
so-called
deportation
cases
that
are
heard,
deportability
is
not
contested.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
to
give
the
alien
voluntary
departure
which
is
quite
different
from
suspension
of
deportation
or
suspension.
there's
a
good
practical
reason
for
not
splitting
up
the
hearing
in
this
particular
case.
there
were
--
there
was
one
hearing,
it
was
closed
and
then
reopened
again
to
consider
the
question
of
suspension
of
deportation.
but
in
most
cases,
there's
no
question
about
deportability
and
in
most
of
the
cases
in
which
there's
no
question
about
deportability,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
aliens
to
be
given
voluntary
departure,
that
is
to
say
allowed
to
leave
the
country
freely
without
being
deported
in
order
that
he
will
not
be
barred
if
he
tries
to
reenter
at
a
later
date
because
he
has
been
deported
in
the
past.
suspension
does
not
require
the
alien
to
leave
the
country
at
all.
his
status
is
adjusted
and
he
is
allowed
to
stay
here
as
a
permanent
resident.
now,
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
and
this
is
mentioned
in
the
government's
brief
in
a
footnote
that
of
the
suspension
of
deportation
cases,
there's
10%
of
the
number
of
total
of
deportation
cases
that
confidential
information,
the
government
is
advised
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
from
their
records,
is
used
in
less
than
5%.
now,
i
should
like
to
if
i
may
to
proceed
to
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
true.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
explain
it
this
way
that
on
the
question
of
eligibility
for
suspension
of
deportation,
it
is
true
that
the
normal
rules
of
evidence
apply
in
these
--
in
these
hearings.
if
it's
a
matter
of
hearsay,
it
will
normally
be
excluded,
there
is
confrontation.
all
of
the
usual
historical
safeguards
against
arbitrary
action
are
taken
in
the
deportation
proceedings.
when
it
--
and
--
and
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
they
certainly
are
taking
in
deportation
proceedings
and
the
same
is
true
in
this
discretionary
relief
of
suspension
of
deportation.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
operation
of
the
discretion,
bear
in
mind
that
this
discretionary
power
and
this
is
the
government's
position
is
so
broad
and
so
unique
and
so
much
of
a
blank
check
that
the
congress
has
provided
that
it
does
not
even
become
operative
until
the
alien
can
show
that
he
is
eligible
for
this
relief.
the
reason
--
and
when
the
discretion
does
become
operative,
then
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
--
it
is
entirely
within
the
legislative
purpose
that
the
attorney
general
can
take
into
consideration
in
making
his
decision
any
information
that
he
deems
appropriate
and
necessary
providing
he
stays
within
the
limits
of
the
applicable
regulations.
now,
this
might
include
hearsay
evidence.
it
might
include
evidence
that
you
couldn't
get
in,
in
a
court
of
law
and
that
is
the
type
of
information
i
believe
that
you're
referring
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
page
12.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
an
informant?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
that
the
attorney
general
in
--
in
exercising
this
discretionary
relief
is
entitled
to
use
that
kind
of
information
if
he
thinks
it's
relevant
and
necessary
to
use
and
necessary
in
the
public
interest
to
keep
it
confidential.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
now,
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
go
--
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
think
that
the
statute,
that
the
congress
allows
that
same
wide
unbridled
unfeathered
discretion
to
operate
in
the
actual
case
of
qualification
for
a
suspension
of
deportation.
but
contrary
to
that,
the
attorney
general
has
chosen
to
prescribe
for
himself
regulations
which
require
the
use
of
record
information
in
determining
the
question
of
eligibility
before
the
discretion
becomes
operative.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i'll
--
i'll
address
myself
to
that.
in
the
relatively
few
cases
in
which
deportability
is
in
issue,
the
regulations
--
the
statute
requires
and
the
regulations
conformed
to
the
statue
that
every
safeguard
or
procedural
due
process
should
be
accorded
to
the
alien
and
i'll
refer
to
those.
secondly,
the
statute
also
provides
and
the
regulation
is
consistent
that
the
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer,
which
is
appealable
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
shall
be
based
upon
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
which
is
on
the
record
that
the
--
the
alien
has
a
right
to
take
the
decision
which
--
which
is
based
only
on
the
record
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
they
take
a
look
at
it
to
see
whether
or
not
the
record
evidence
was
substantial,
probative
and
--
and
reasonable
then
he
can
go
to
court
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
this
alien
contested
the
issue
of
deportability.
he
went
to
the
special
inquiry
officer.
he
went
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
then
he
went
to
court.
and
he
lost
in
all
three
places.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
he's
--
he's
required
to
separate
the
two
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
because
--
because
the
alien
--
he
is
required
to
base
his
decision
and
make
his
findings
on
--
on
information
only
and
testimony
only
as
to
which
the
alien
has
access,
may
cross-examine,
is
given
notice
of
and
all
the
rest
and
it's
on
the
record.
if
the
record
doesn't
support
the
finding
of
the
special
inquiry
officer,
without
reference
to
any
of
this
other
material
which
may
possibly
at
this
point
come
in,
in
most
cases
it
would
come
in
after
the
issue
of
the
deportability
is
decided
and
then
you
go
into
this
other
end
of
it.
but
if
it
should
and
it's
permissible
that
it
might,
if
it
should,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
is
in
a
position
to
reverse
it
and
if
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
doesn't
do
it,
the
court
can
do
it.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
think
that
it
happens
that
a
judge
in
the
course
of
a
trial
that
counsel
will
try
to
get
in
the
evidence.
a
material
which
is
not
admissible
and
yet
--
and
the
judge
we'll
exclude
it,
let's
assume
it's
a
non-jury
trial.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
the
judge
will
exclude
it.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he
--
he
cannot
use
it
in
the
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
he
can't
--
he
cannot
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
use
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
on
--
if
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
when
the
--
when
the
trial
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
when
the
--
the
trial
is
over,
let's
assume
it's
a
criminal
trial
and
the
man
has
been
convicted,
then
of
course
the
judge
will
consider
any
information
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
--
to
guide
him
in
making
a
judgment
in
an
individualistic
manner
as
to
whether
suspension
should
be
granted
in
probation.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i'll
concede
that
point,
but
i
--
but
i
will
not
concede
that
--
that
in
a
hearing
procedure
on
a
question
of
eligibility,
and
we're
not
concerned
with
deportability,
there's
been
no
challenge
to
that
here,
not
at
all.
on
the
question
of
eligibility,
the
attorney
general
isn't
even
required
to
hold
a
hearing
--
a
hearing
and
yet
he
does.
now,
i
--
i
cannot
see
that
there's
been
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
that
has
any
relationship
to
the
instant
case
because
there
was
a
deportation
proceeding
which
preceded
this
and
in
this
case
the
deportation
proceeding
did
precede
the
proceeding
having
to
do
with
suspension
at
which
the
alien
was
found
deportable,
found
by
the
bia,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
be
deported
and
found
by
the
court
that
the
evidence
was
substantial,
probative
and
reasonable
on
the
record.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
true
and
--
and
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
yes
--
yes
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
of
course,
it
doesn't.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
now,
let
me
address
myself
to
that
point.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
before
we
go
any
further
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
what
has
the
attorney
general
done
with
respect
to
prescribing
a
hearing
in
this
case
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
nature
of
his
power
is
that
we're
dealing
with.
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
suspension
of
deportation
is
an
act
of
grace,
that
wherein
otherwise
fully
deportable,
admittedly
deportable
and
mandatorily
deportable
alien
is
concerned
that
the
congress
has
vested
in
the
attorney
general
an
unusually
wide
and
somewhat
unique
discretionary
power
to
withhold
deportation.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
--
in
a
suspension
of
deportation
case?
it's
not
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
answer
that
this
--
this
way.
as
i
read
section
244,
the
suspension
provision,
it
provides
as
follows
that
as
herein
after
prescribed
in
this
section,
“the
attorney
general
may,
in
his
discretion,
suspend
deportation
et
cetera
of
an
alien
who
is
deportable
for
various
reasons.”
and
then
it
goes
on
and
it
gives
the
list
of
qualifications
which
are
very
stringent
qualifications
that
must
be
met
before
this
discretionary
power
becomes
operative.
in
other
words,
if
you
turn
to
(c),
subparagraph
(c)
on
the
following
page,
“upon
application
by
any
alien
who
is
found
by
the
attorney
general
to
meet
the
requirements
of
(4)
or
(5)
of
subsection
(a),
the
attorney
general
may,
in
his
discretion,
suspend
deportation.”
in
other
words,
congress
had
a
purpose
to
deport
deportable
aliens
and
it
very
carefully
withdrew
all
discretion
from
the
attorney
general
when
it
came
to
that.
section
241,
the
deportation
section
says
that
the
attorney
general
must
deport
and
then
list
section
after
section
of
the
most
carefully
spelled
out
provisions
hitting
aliens
who
the
congress
has
decided,
whether
or
not
we
agree
with
the
substantive
grounds
and
as
--
is
not
any
of
my
business
or
the
court's
business
at
this
point,
must
be
deported
and
it
then
goes
on
after
saying
in
section
241
that
deportation
must
be
affected
of
these
aliens,
it
prescribes
in
section
242
of
the
act
very
careful
procedures
to
effect
this
deportation.
now,
i'm
referring
to
page
15
of
the
government's
brief
in
footnote
10.
note
what
the
statute
provides,
“that
the
special
inquiry
officer
shall
conduct
proceedings
that
determination
of
deportability
in
any
case
shall
be
made
only
upon
a
record
at
which
the
--
the
alien
shall
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
present.”
turning
the
page,
“the
attorney
general
may
prescribe
regulations
which
shall
include
requirements
that
the
alien
shall
be
given
notice
of
the
charges,
shall
have
the
privilege
of
being
represented,
reasonable
opportunity
to
examine
the
evidence
against
him,
to
present
evidence
on
his
own
behalf,
cross-examine
and
that
this
procedure
so
prescribed
should
be
the
solemn
exclusive
procedure.”
now,
this
is
deportation.
when
it
comes
to
suspension,
the
only
thing
that
the
congress
saw
fit
to
say
was
that
the
attorney
general
in
four
words
“may,
in
his
discretion,”
suspend
deportation.
the
alien
in
order
to
be
even
qualified
for
this
extraordinary
relief
is
required
to
show
that
he
meets
these
most
stringent
requirements.
now,
there
may
be
lots
of
other
aliens
who
have
done
--
committed
no
worst
substantive
offense
perhaps
less,
who
have
got
to
leave
the
country
but
they
can't
meet
these
requirements.
my
point
is
this
then
that
congress,
knowing
that
it
was
giving
the
attorney
general
a
blank
check
and
that
it
had
to
give
the
attorney
general
a
blank
check
in
order
to
make
this
power
useful
or
effective.
it
--
it's
no
good
unless
it's
as
broad
as
it
can
possibly
be
for
this
reason,
but
you
can't
categorize
cases
where
the
attorney
general
should
grant
the
armor
of
clemency
anymore
than
you
can
categorize
the
cases
in
which
the
congress
has
seen
fit
to
enact
special
bills.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
would
agree,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
--
that
the
court
can
take
a
look
at
the
prescribed
--
the
prescribed
procedure
that
the
attorney
general
has
--
has
promulgated.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
i
will
agree
he's
bound
by
it.
accardi
tells,
it
said
he's
bound
by
it.
and
accardi
says
that
the
alien
must
be
given
whatever
benefits
the
regulations
in
fact
--
in
fact
provide.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
we're
driven
back
to
the
regulations.
now,
let's
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
do
and
let
me
quote
to
you
just
one
sentence
out
of
the
senate
committee
report
that
accompanied
this
bill,
“technical
compliance
by
the
alien
with
the
formal
eligibility
requirements
does
not
necessitate
a
conclusion
that
he
will
be
granted
suspension
of
deportation.”
and
there
are
cases
which
--
and
that
there
are
recent
cases
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals,
district
of
columbia.
one
that
is
particularly
note
worthy
where
the
special
inquiry
also
did
find
that
the
alien
met
the
minimum
requirements
of
eligibility
and
he
still
--
the
special
inquiry
officer
still
denied
suspension
of
deportation
on
the
question
of
hardship.
he
said
this
meets
the
minimum
requirement
but
he's
got
no
family
here,
admittedly
he
claims
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
work
if
he
gets
deported,
he
doesn't
know
--
he
can't
speak
the
language
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
still
in
the
exercise
of
discretion,
i
deny
suspension.
i
am
referring
to
the
melachrinos
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
said
this,
he
further
found
that
while
the
appellant
met
the
minimum
statutory
requirements
so
far
as
eligibility
for
suspension
of
deportation
was
concerned,
suspension
of
deportation
was
not
warranted
and
so
forth.
now
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
say
--
i
think
unlimited
of
course
is
a
--
is
a
broad
word.
i
have
the
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
the
government
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
almost
unlimited.
i
think
it
comes
--
that
--
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
define
what
the
nature
of
this
beast
is
that
we've
--
that
we've
got
in
front
of
us.
the
government's
view
of
it
is,
is
that
it
comes
close
to
being
as
broad
as
the
power
of
the
president,
chief
executive
in
granting
a
pardon.
now,
obviously
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
which
is
unlimited.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
now,
obviously,
the
pardoning
power
is
one
which
is
an
ancient
right
of
the
crown
which
is
deeply
embedded
in
our
constitution
and
it
might
be
presumptuous
to
say
that
this
particular
power
is
as
broad
as
that.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
this
power
as
being
as
broad
as
the
power
of
the
congress
in
a
sense
to
enact
a
private
bill.
you've
got
in
a
way
the
same
considerations
here
and
after
all
the
congress
was
sick
to
death
of
enacting
private
bills
and
it
gave
this
broad
power
to
the
attorney
general
to
take
an
alien
who's
got
to
leave,
the
congress
has
said
he's
got
to
leave
and
arbitrarily
say,
"no,
you
can
stay
because
it's
going
to
be
hardship
on
you
or
your
wife."
the
same
thing
is
done
by
the
congress
when
it
enacts
a
private
bill
and
this
is
suggestive
to
me
of
a
political
power,
not
adjudicated
power.
the
very
fact
that
is
made
reviewable
by
the
congress,
the
suspension,
the
granting
of
this
--
of
this
clemency
is
made
reviewable
by
the
congress,
to
me
is
suggestive
of
a
political
power.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
this
particular
type
of
discretion,
although
it
is
limited
to
the
extent
that
if
it
affirmatively
appears
that
its
exercise
has
been
so
arbitrary
or
capricious
that
nobody
can
swallow
it,
that
it
is
just
short
of
that
and
that
it
is
almost
--
or
it's
analogous
to
the
action
of
the
congress
in
enacting
a
private
bill
and
the
action
of
the
president
or
the
governor
of
a
state
in
commuting
a
sentence
or
granting
a
pardon
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
that's
--
i
recall
the
case
of
norwegian
nitrogen
company
in
volume
288.
and
there
the
--
as
i
recall
it,
this
court
said
what
in
substance
the
congress
did
was
to
transfer
a
legislative
process
from
itself
to
the
president
and
the
president
was
required
to
accept
and
receive
the
advice
of
the
tariff
commission,
if
you
recall.
and
the
tariff
commission
was
required
to
hold
hearings
on
the
question
of
rates,
tariff
rates.
and
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
tariff
commission
as
a
result
of
these
hearings
could
take
any
consideration
a
lot
of
information
which
was
never
disclosed
to
complaining
parties
to
the
tariff.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
it
would
advice
the
president
as
to
what
action
should
be
taken.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
all
right,
let's
talk
about
that.
let
me
--
i
think
that
it's
all
but
conceded.
i
take
it
its
conceded
on
oral
argument
and
i
know
it's
conceded
by
--
by
the
brief
of
amicus
and
from
the
question
presented
on
page
2
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
it's
conceded
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
required
to
hold
a
hearing.
so,
he
has
prescribed
that
on
the
issue
of
eligibility.
in
other
words,
these
minimum
requirements
that
have
to
be
met
and
bear
in
mind
when
i
refer
to
those
minimum
requirements
and
i'll
refer
to
this
a
little
bit
more
fully
in
a
moment,
i
mean
that
the
congress
intended
that
this
power
was
to
be
used
sparingly.
on
the
question
of
eligibility,
the
attorney
general
has
prescribed
a
hearing.
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
pardon?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
it
--
my
information
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
is
that
approximately
10%
of
the
uncontested
deportability
cases
involve
suspension.
the
rest
of
the
--
the
bulk
of
them
is
the
question
of
voluntary
departure
which
is
quite
a
different
thing.
now,
that's
--
those
figures
are
very
rough
and
they
are
referred
to
in
the
footnote
of
the
government's
--
in
a
footnote
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
how
many
get
suspended
frequently?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
would
--
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
wouldn't
know
how
many
suspension
cases
that
came
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
as
suspension
was
upheld.
i
--
i
couldn't
tell
you
that.
i
have
to
supply
those
figures.
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that,
mr.
justice
minton,
if
you'd
like
to.
but
i
--
but
i'd
like
to
pursue
this
thought
about
the
hearing
for
just
a
minute
more.
i
--
i
submit
that
you
are
required
to
log
at
all
four
corners
of
the
regulations.
now,
the
regulation
providing
for
--
the
use
of
confidential
information
in
the
decision
making
process
of
the
attorney
general
was
promulgated
in
this
instance
at
the
same
that
the
other
regulations
were
submitted.
so,
you're
--
you're
not
within
accardi,
you're
outside
of
accardi.
and
--
and
i
--
i
do
not
understand
the
logic
of
saying
that
where
the
attorney
general
has
to
give
no
bread
that
a
half
a
loaf
is
worse
than
nothing.
i
can't
understand
that
in
--
in
this
type
of
clemency
proceedings,
after
all
what
he
has
done
has
prescribed
a
hearing
which
is
in
aid
of
his
decision
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
alien
fares
no
better,
if
anything,
he
fares
worst
if
the
attorney
general
turns
around
tomorrow
and
abolishes
the
hearing,
wipes
it
out
completely
and
says
that
the
suspension
of
deportation
decision
shall
be
based
on
submission
of
papers
to
the
attorney
general
and
he'll
make
his
decision
accordingly.
i
don't
think
that
the
alien
is
in
a
better
position.
i
think
he's
in
the
worst
position
because
he
has
not
given
the
right
to
present
his
side
of
the
story.
well,
i
should
like
to
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no
he
--
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
where
it's
in
the
--
where
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
national
government
to
do
it,
they
do.
and
--
and
a
judge
--
a
judge
does
the
same
thing
when
he
grant
suspension
of
sentence.
and
--
and
the
president
does
the
same
thing
when
he
grants
a
pardon
and
that
is
exactly
what
we've
got
here.
and
--
and
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i
think
i
have
to
say
this
that
if
the
hearing
officer
makes
his
decision
on
the
basis
of
confidential
information,
he
has
to
say
so.
and
he
does
say
so.
and
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no,
he
doesn't,
but
he
goes
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
--
which
knows
what
it
is.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i
don't'
agree
with
you.
the
section
242.53,
conduct
of
hearings,
for
example
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he
proves
everything
that
he
is
--
that
he
is
required
to
prove
to
show
that
he
is
eligible
for
this
extraordinary
relief.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
this
is
not
--
i
--
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
not
a
proceeding
where
there
are
charges.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
not
adversary.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
correct
in
following
the
regulations.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
if
the
--
if
the
--
if
under
accardi,
the
alien
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
has
in
fact
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
correct.
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
i
would
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
pardon?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he
can
--
he
can
prove
it
by
great
many
methods
and
--
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
but
that's
--
it
strictly
goes
to
the
question
of
eligibility
and
--
and
mr.
justice
harlan
put
his
finger
on
it
when
he
said,
"after
all
what
was
congress
trying
to
do?"
congress
was
not
trying
to
--
to
prevent
or
to
give
relief
to
deportable
aliens
except
under
the
most
unusual
circumstances
and
even
anyone
could
take
a
look
at
it.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
let
me
answer
that
this
way.
congress
--
congress
in
the
judgment
of
the
government
thought
that
this
power
should
be
exercised
only
in
the
most
unusual
case.
it
should
be
exercised
sparingly.
in
the
first
place,
it
discriminates
against
other
aliens
who
are
being
deported
all
the
time
for
reasons
which
congress
said
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
agree
with
you
that
this
is
an
individualistic
power
just
as
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
that
gets
back
to
the
point
i
made
to
the
chief
justice,
which
is
i
agree
there
is
a
limit
on
the
exercise
of
this
power.
and
that
is
that
if
it
appears
affirmatively
to
be
so
capricious,
so
that
the
attorney
general
says
that
--
that
he
will
grant
suspension
for
this
man
because
he's
got
red
hair
and
not
for
this
man
because
he
doesn't
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
of
course
that
is
reviewable.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
any
--
well,
it
maybe
--
it
maybe
a
statement
but
i
--
but
i
should
still
like
to
comment
upon
it
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
and
say
this
that
the
same
applies
--
the
same
applies
when
a
judge
exercises
the
power
of
suspension
of
sentence.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
--
and
under
these
circumstances,
i
cannot
see
how
it
can
be
said
that
a
regulation
which
provides
for
the
use
of
this
information
in
a
clemency
proceeding
is
unreasonable.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
when
it's
in
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
now,
i'll
get
back
to
the
concession
that
is
made
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
which
is
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
required
to
hold
any
type
of
hearing
at
all.
and
that
when
he
sets
up
a
procedure
which
aids
him
in
finding
out
whether
the
man
can
meet
the
test
of
qualification,
eligibility
so
that
the
discretion
becomes
operative,
then
he's
met
all
the
requirements,
one
of
the
statute
and
two
of
procedural
due
process
and
of
course
there's
no
constitutional
question
here
raised
anyway.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
would
agree
--
i
would
agree
that
if
it
affirmatively
appears
that
confidential
information
has
been
used
and
it
affirmatively
increases
--
it
is
so
arbitrary
and
capricious
that
it
cannot
--
that
--
that
no
right-minded
man
could
possibly
agree
with
it,
the
court
would
have
the
right
to
take
a
look
at
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
that's
a
very
rare
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
because
you're
not
determining
a
question
of
eligibility
for
this
relief.
and
that's
--
and
that's
what
we
come
down
to.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
think
you
do
and
that's
why
i
said
that
--
that
i
do
think
that
--
but
i
do
think
that
the
cases
--
i
think
i've
got
to
concede
this
much
that
if
it
does
appear
and
this
is
what
a
second
circuit
decisions
as
you
will
note
in
the
government's
brief
will
bear
out
that
if
it
affirmatively
appears
that
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
which
is
this
broad
is
entirely
capricious
why
then
it
might
be
reviewable
by
the
courts.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
would
not
think
that
that
type
of
--
of
thing
would
be
within
the
limitations
of
section
22
--
244.3.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it's
not
in
the
public
interest,
safety
or
security
to
keep
that
type
of
information
confidential.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
say
that
he
could
not
keep
it
confidential.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
record.
that
would
have
to
be
given
as
his
--
if
he
was
going
to
grant
suspension
for
that
reason,
assuming
--
assuming
qualification
have
been
met,
if
he
decided
that
was
the
reason
that
he
wanted
to
grant
suspension,
he
put
it
in
the
--
he
put
it
in
his
statement
and
send
it
to
the
congress.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
would
not
allow
him
to
prove
it,
and
i
don't
thing
that
that
would
be
in
the
file
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
because
that
doesn't
meet
the
standard.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
you're
taking
a
case
where
suspension
had
been
granted.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
unless
it
appeared
affirmatively
on
the
face
of
the
proceeding,
you
could
not
inquire,
you
could
not
--
you
can't
probe
his
mind
to
find
out
what
led
him
to
grant
or
deny
suspension
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
in
these
cases.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
think
that's
the
result
that
you
reach
if
you
concede
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
required
to
hold
a
hearing
in
these
--
in
these
proceedings.
i
--
i
--
if
you
give
me
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
if
you
permit
me
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
but
i
--
i
will
say
this
also
that
there
isn't
decision
of
this
court
which
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
when
a
--
the
attorney
general
or
any
other
cabinet
officer
prescribes
a
hearing
or
prescribes
a
procedure
which
is
in
aid
of
his
making
a
decision
that
it's
got
to
be
this
type
of
procedure
or
got
to
be
that
type
of
procedure
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
providing
--
providing
his
regulations
appear
in
writing
that
the
alien
in
this
particular
case
knows
about
them
and
the
--
and
the
attorney
general
follows
them.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
that
the
attorney
general
can
amend
his
regulations
and
abolish
a
hearing.
i
think
he
can.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no,
not
for
a
particular
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
would
--
i
would
say
if
it
followed
the
usual
procedure
of
a
notice
through
the
--
through
the
federal
register
and
the
rest
of
it
that
there
would
be
--
it
would
be
perfectly
permissible
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
if
he
redrafted
his
regulations
and
gave
up
and
submitted
them
to
the
public
via
the
federal
register
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
and
in
that
--
in
that
revision,
he
has
abolished
a
hearing,
it
would
stand
up
in
court.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
think
he
could
do
that.
no,
i
don't
--
i
mean
--
i
mean
he's
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
he's
prescribed
a
hearing
and
the
--
and
the
alien
conducts
himself
accordingly
and
then
when
the
alien
walks
into
the
hearing
room,
a
special
inquiry
officer
gets
up
and
walks
out
and
says
i
just
discovered
the
attorney
general
has
abolished
the
hearing.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
i
mean,
i
--
i
think
that
that's
not
compliance
with
the
existing
regulations
and
you
can't
change
the
regulations
unless
you
follow
other
established
rules.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
we're
getting
a
little
--
we're
getting
a
little
technical
about
how
you
go
about
change
in
the
regulations
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
it
would
seem
to
me.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
don't
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
answer
to
that
question
a
situation
which
the
second
circuit
was
confronted
with
in
--
in
1950
of
a
case
called
the
kaloudis
case
which
is
cited
at
page
20
of
the
government's
brief.
now,
there,
you
have
not
quite
this
situation
on
all
force,
we
did
in
the
second
circuit
a
little
bit
later.
we've
got
the
same
situation
as
you
got
here
and
it's
been
--
and
it's
been
settled
in
that
circuit.
but
in
the
kaloudis
case
this
very
question
came
up
of
how
far
can
you
go
in
probing
the
mind
of
the
officer
who's
exercising
this
discretion?
there,
the
case
was
--
the
alien
had
been
sometime
in
the
past
a
member
of
the
international
workers
order.
now,
there
have
been
no
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
information
as
to
whether
he
was
a
member
with
knowledge
of
any
character
that
it
may
have
had,
that
he
was
an
actively
engaged
member
whether
he
joined
it
for
insurance
purposes
or
why.
and
the
second
circuit
said
this,
"true
without
an
inquiry
we
cannot
know
where
the
membership
in
the
--
in
the
iwo
was
prejudicial
for
we
cannot
tell
whether
the
attorney
--
the
attorney
general
had
adequate
grounds
for
proscribing
it.
on
the
other
hand,
we
cannot
say
that
he
did
not
and
if
the
relator
has
any
privilege
of
inquiring
into
the
grounds
he
has
been
wronged
and
the
rich
should
have
gone."
this
is
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
an
alien
has
no
such
privilege
unless
the
ground
stated
is
on
its
face
insufficient,
he
must
accept
the
decision
for
it
was
made
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
which
we
have
again
and
again
declared
that
we
will
not
review,
skipping
a
bit.
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
suspend
deportation
is
a
dispensing
power.
like
a
judge's
power
to
suspend
execution
of
sentence
or
the
president's
to
pardon
a
convict.
it
is
a
matter
of
grace
over
which
the
court's
have
no
review
unless
it
affirmatively
appears
that
denial
has
been
actuated
by
considerations
of
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
make
relevant.
now,
a
little
bit
later
came
the
matranga
case
which
i
shan't
go
into,
decided
by
the
second
circuit
in
1952
at
which
this
very
question
was
in
point.
and
the
second
circuit
squarely
held
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
discretionary
decision,
not
going
to
the
question
of
eligibility
but
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
suspension
should
be
sustained,
should
be
granted
or
not
and
that
the
attorney
general
therefore
may
consider
confidential
information.
in
this
case,
the
regulation
hadn't
yet
been
promulgated.
it
was
prior
to
the
1952
act
and
prior
to
the
new
regulations.
one
--
one
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
what
the
court
said
--
said
was
this,
"since
it
was
used,
the
confidential
informations,
for
its
bearing
of
--
for
its
bearing
on
the
formulation
of
a
discretionary
decision,
our
precedence
bar
relief."
then
a
bit
--
a
bit
up
above
that
it
--
"the
decision
states
in
any
event
the
record
does
not
show
the
use
of
confidential
information
in
the
determination
of
these
issues,"
referring
to
eligibility.
the
--
the
statutory
minimum
requirements,
10
years
continuos
residence,
a
showing
of
good
moral
character
during
that
period,
no
final
order
of
deportation
being
issued
by
the
attorney
general
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he
may
have
a
hearing
and
he's
given
a
hearing.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
that
--
that
it
--
it
says
prove
and
--
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
argument
i
will
concede
that
--
that
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
that
he's
got
to
have
a
hearing
to
prove
minimum
qualification.
i
don't
--
i
want
to
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
he
could
do
it
by
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he
could
--
he
could
it
for
affidavit.
he
could
do
it
on
paper
application.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
let
me
answer
it
this
way
if
--
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
black.
there
is
another
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
says
that
the
attorney
general
may
withhold
deportation
where
there
--
in
his
opinion
there
is
a
likelihood
that
the
alien
will
be
subjected
to
physical
persecution
in
the
country
to
which
he
is
being
deported.
there
is
no
hearing
prescribed
for
that.
it's
done
purely
on
papers
but
the
alien
is
given
an
opportunity
under
the
practice
to
submit
a
showing
as
to
--
as
to
his
view
as
to
why
he
would
be
subjected
to
physical
persecution
if
he
was
sent
to
that
country.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no,
they
call
it
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
what
it
says
is
--
what
the
provision
says
is
actually
this,
"the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
withhold
deportation
of
any
alien
within
the
united
states
to
any
country
in
which
--
in
which
in
his
opinion
the
alien
would
be
subject
to
physical
persecution
and
for
such
period
of
time
as
he
deems
to
be
necessary
for
such
reason."
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it's
a
bit
different,
i'll
concede
that.
i'll
concede
that.
let
me
say
this,
here's
--
here's
one
more
point,
it
is
provided
in
the
act
that
an
alien
who
receives
a
pardon
or
an
alien
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
as
to
which
the
judge
recommends
against
deportation
does
not
come
within
the
specific
spelled
out
provisions
as
to
deportability.
you
wouldn't
--
you
couldn't
make
an
argument
that
the
alien
would
be
entitled
to
know
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
factors
and
--
and
considerations
that
the
judge
took
into
consideration
or
that
the
governor
of
a
state
took
into
consideration
when
he
denied
pardon
in
the
case
of
the
governor
or
denied
or
declined
to
make
a
recommendation
against
the
deportation
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
and
yet
the
effect
is
the
same
--
and
yet
the
effect
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
don't
think
he
does
tear
it
down
and
i
don't
think
that
--
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
i
don't
go
so
far
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
go
so
far
either
as
to
say
that
--
that
it's
absolutely
necessary
under
interpretations
of
this
court
to
require
a
hearing
and
--
and
to
prove
these
minimum
qualifications.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
the
type
--
yes,
i
mean
the
normal
type
for
adversary
hearing
which
this
is
not
because
it's
not
an
adversary
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
it's
not
an
adversary
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
may
i
answer
your
question
this
way,
your
honor,
and
i
see
my
time
is
up
so
i'll
make
it
brief.
in
exclusion
cases,
knauff
and
mezei
are
two
cases
which
deal
with
exclusion
and
they
hold
that
confidential
information
there
may
be
used
without
a
hearing
to
exclude
an
alien.
now,
there
--
there
isn't
any
area
of
discretion
in
the
attorney
general.
the
alien
has
met
all
qualifications,
his
visa
is
open,
he's
in
line,
his
health
is
okay,
his
papers
are
in
order
and
yet
because
of
confidential
information,
the
attorney
general
is,
under
the
statute
and
upheld
by
this
court,
is
entitled
to
say,
"we
will
not
let
him
in
without
any
hearing.
he
cannot
prove
anything.
he
can't
even
show
that
he's
eligible
under
the
code
and
all
the
rest
of
it."
now,
in
the
instant
case,
the
alien
here
is
even
in
a
worst
position.
he
is
in
an
inferior
status.
his
status
has
been
adjudicated,
he's
out.
he
is
to
be
deported.
the
alien
who's
coming
in
hasn't
even
had
a
chance
to
--
to
show
anything.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
right.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
right.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
think
he's
got
to
take
proof
on
that
and
then
i
think
he's
got
to
take
the
alien
submission
of
proof,
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
alien
who's
being
sent
off
to
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
there
--
there,
you
and
i
are
different.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
very
different.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
just
--
i
just
quoted
you
a
case
decided
recently
by
the
court
of
appeals
where
unusual
hardship
--
minimum
requirement
of
unusual
hardship
and
it
was
pretty
tough
if
you
read
that
case
when
you
come
to
it
in
the
government's
brief
and
the
attorney
general
still
said,
"i
will
not
exercise
discretion
in
favor
of
the
alien
in
this
case."
that's
the
--
that's
the
melachrinos
case
which
appears
in
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
in
volume
230.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no,
because
of
his
own
regulation.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
--
i
would
prefer
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'd
prefer
when
it
comes
to
the
--
this
question
of
proof
to
adopt
the
suggestion
of
mr.
justice
minton
that
--
that
he
could
still
--
that
the
requirements
of
due
process,
procedural
due
process
in
this
extraordinary
type
of
relief
couldn't
be
met
on
proof
by
a
submission
on
papers.
i'd
go
--
i'd
go
that
far
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
don't
think
he
can.
i
think
he
finds
--
he
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
he
finds
that
the
alien
then
has
met
the
minimum
qualifications
for
eligibility.
