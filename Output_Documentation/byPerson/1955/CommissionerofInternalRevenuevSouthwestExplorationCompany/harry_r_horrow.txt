mr.
harry
r.
horrow
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent,
huntington
beach
company,
is
one
of
the
upland
owners
on
whose
land,
the
oil
wells
--
oil
wells
were
located
which
were
drilled
under
the
ocean
and
into
the
tidelands.
the
respondent
received
17.75%
of
the
net
profits
from
the
production
of
that
oil
and
gas.
the
respondent
claimed
depletion
on
those
net
profits
payments
and
depletion
was
allowed
by
the
court
below.
the
respondent
contends
that
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
that
the
depletion
deduction
should
be
a
portioned
to
those
who
share
in
the
income
from
production
in
accordance
with
their
shares.
that
is
to
say,
in
the
case
of
the
respondent,
depletion
should
be
allowed
on
its
net
profits
payments.
in
the
case
of
southwest,
depletion
should
be
allowed
only
on
the
portion
of
the
income
which
it
is
entitled
to
keep
and
depletion
should
be
allowed
on
the
portion
of
the
income
from
production
which
it
is
required
to
pay
over,
the
royalties
to
the
state
and
the
net
profits
payments
to
the
upland
owners.
of
course,
these
net
profit
payments
are
taxable
to
the
upland
owners
and,
of
course,
the
royalties
and
the
net
profits
payments
that
are
paid
by
southwest
would
not
be
taxable
to
southwest.
the
facts
in
--
in
this
case
differ
in
no
material
respect
from
those
in
the
companion
case,
286.
they
have
been
stated
by
the
government
counsel,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
steps
involved
in
bringing
about
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
on
the
state
lands.
the
first
step
was
a
call
for
bids
on
the
state
lease.
under
that
call,
the
only
persons
eligible
to
bid
for
the
state
lease
were
the
upland
owners
or
those
to
whom
the
upland
owners
were
willing
to
sell
their
property
or
grant
the
use
of
their
property.
they
were
not
compelled
under
the
state
law
to
grant
the
use
of
their
property
to
anybody,
certainly
not
to
southwest.
southwest
at
that
time
had
been
an
inactive
corporation.
it
own
no
property,
controlled
no
property
in
the
area
and
had
no
--
no
right
to
insist
that
huntington
beach
or
the
other
upland
owners
convey
to
it
the
right
to
use
the
property
in
order
to
make
it
eligible
for
the
bid.
the
upland
owners
chose
not
to
bid
for
the
state
lease.
they
chose
not
to
sell
their
property.
they
chose
instead
to
grant
the
use
of
their
property
to
southwest
and
make
southwest
eligible
to
bid
on
the
state
lease.
southwest,
thereby,
become
the
only
eligible
bidder.
and,
of
course,
the
state
lease
was
granted
to
southwest,
but
that
lease
was
not
unconditional.
southwest
had
no
right
under
that
lease
to
enter
upon
the
tidelands
and
produce
upon
the
tidelands.
the
lease
required
that
southwest
use
the
property
of
the
upland
owners
and
drill
its
wells
through
the
upland
owners'
property.
so
that
the
grant
by
the
state
of
the
right
to
extract
the
oil
from
the
--
the
submerged
lands
was
not
effective.
it
was
not
complete
without
the
grant
that
was
made
by
the
upland
owners.
both
grants
were
necessary
in
order
to
permit
southwest
to
enter
upon
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
in
the
tidelands.
in
consideration
of
the
grant
of
the
use
of
their
property,
southwest
agreed
to
pay
the
upland
owners
24.5%
of
the
net
profits,
in
the
case
of
the
respondent,
17.75%
of
the
net
profits
from
all
of
the
operation
on
the
state
lands.
the
upland
owners
were
not
limited
to
a
share
in
the
net
profits
from
the
wells
that
were
located
on
their
lands.
it
is
true
that
the
lease
required
that
the
wells
be
located
on
their
lands.
but
if
the
lease
should
be
modified
so
as
to
permit
vertical
drilling
into
the
tidelands,
the
upland
owners
will
share
in
the
net
profits
from
those
wells
as
well
as
the
producing
wells
that
are
now
located
on
their
property.
the
grant
of
the
use
of
a
property,
the
agreement
covering
the
share
in
net
profits
were
inseparably
apart
of
the
state
lease.the
state
lease
was
not
operated
without
the
grant
that
was
made
by
the
upland
owners.
no
production
could
have
taken
place
without
that
grant
and
the
grant
of
the
use
of
a
property,
the
right
to
share
in
the
profits
were
coextensive
with
the
lease.
the
lease
was
for
a
term
of
20
years
or
so
long
thereafter
as
oil
and
gas
might
be
produced
and
the
same
was
true
of
the
grant
to
the
upland
owners
for
the
use
of
their
property
as
well
as
their
share
in
the
profits.
now,
the
respondent
contends
that
under
those
arrangements,
it
had
an
economic
interest
in
the
production
of
the
oil
and
gas
in
the
tidelands.
i
say
economic
interest
because
that
is
the
term
that
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
has
used
in
all
of
its
decisions
relating
to
a
depletable
interest.
but
this
court
has
used
the
term
economic
interest
in
describing
a
depletable
interest
because
it
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
is
the
economic
relation
of
the
taxpayer
to
the
oil
and
gas
production,
not
the
legal
relation
that
control
his
right
to
depletion.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
concepts
of
property
law
are
under
the
--
the
applicable
state
jurisdiction,
the
niceties
of
conveyancing
are
ignored,
the
sole
question
in
determining
whether
the
taxpayer
has
a
depletable
interest
is
whether
he
has
a
capital
investment
in
the
oil
and
gas
in
place
and
must
look
solely
to
the
production,
the
income
from
the
production
for
a
return
of
his
capital.
the
respondent
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
the
resource
which
is
depleted
is
our
property
right
which
is
our
right
to
share
in
the
income
from
production,
our
net
profits.
as
the
income
rises
or
falls,
our
property
interest
will
produce
more
or
less
income
and
when
the
oil
is
exhausted,
when
the
mineral
content
has
been
entirely
removed,
our
property
is
exhausted.
the
depletion
allowance
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
our
property,
if
your
honor
please,
is
the
right
to
share
in
the
profits.
the
property
that
we
owned,
the
surface
and
the
right
to
use
the
subsurface
in
drilling
the
wells
that
was
property
which
we
had
--
in
which
we
had
a
capital
investment.we
invested
that
in
the
production
that
was
taking
place
under
the
state
lease,
entitle
--
entitled
to
the
oil
or
to
the
oil
deposit
is
not
necessary
for
depletion.
i
might
add
that
southwest
had
no
title
to
the
mineral
deposit
because
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
under
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
if
the
wells
had
--
had
been
permitted
to
be
drilled
in
the
tidelands
and
no
agreement
had
been
made
between
the
upland
owners
and
southwest,
the
upland
owners
will
have
no
share
in
the
income
from
production.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
correct.
but
the
state
law
required
that
the
wells
be
drilled
through
our
property.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
state
can
change
that
but
the
state
cannot
change
our
agreement,
your
honor.
our
agreement
provides
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
net
profits
from
all
the
operations
on
the
state
lands
whether
or
not
those
operations
take
place
through
slant
drilled
wells
or
whether
they
take
place
through
vertical
wells.
we
have
a
continuing
right
to
share
in
the
income
from
production
of
the
oil
and
gas
under
that
lease
as
long
as
that
lease
is
in
effect
or
any
renewal
or
extension
of
that
lease.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
i
may
take
that
up,
i'd
like
to
--
now,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
--
the
theory
of
the
government
in
which
we
confer.
the
government's
theory
is
predicated
on
its
interpretation
of
the
burton-sutton
case.
that
case
involved
a
right
to
share
in
the
net
profits
under
a
lease
which
the
gulf
refining
company
had
obtained
and
then
in
turn
assigned
to
an
operator.
the
operator
agreed
to
pay
gulf
50%
of
the
net
profits
and
this
court
held
that
that
net
profits
interest
standing
alone
was
depletable.
we
found
no
difference
between
a
net
profits
payment
and
the
situation
in
kirby
where
there
was
a
royalty
interest
together
with
a
share
in
the
net
profits.
the
government
had
contended
in
burton-sutton
that
a
net
profits
interest
standing
alone
was
not
depletable.
if
the
taxpayer
had
to
own
something
else
to
give
him
his
economic
interest,
a
royalty
or
other
interest,
then
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
true,
that
the
net
profits
interest
standing
alone
was
depletable
because
the
mark
of
an
economic
interest
was
a
share
in
the
income
from
production
and
sole
dependency
on
production
for
that
income.
the
burton-sutton
case
left
open
this
question,
if
the
gulf
refining
company
which
held
a
share
in
the
net
profits
sold
that
net
profits
interest
for
cash
or
if
the
operator
turned
around
and
sold
another
portion
of
the
net
profits
to
a
third
party
when
the
purchaser
of
that
net
profits
interest
be
entitled
to
depletion.
and
the
government
contends
that
it
would
be
because
the
taxpayer
would
have
a
capital
investment
in
the
production
of
the
oil
and
gas,
it
could
look
solely
to
the
production
for
a
return
of
its
capital
or
the
possibility
of
profit.
we
conquer
in
that
view.
but
the
respondent
does
not
rest
its
case
on
that
point.
there
are
additional
factors
here
which
attached
to
--
to
our
net
profits
interest
which
we
believe
require
the
recognition
of
an
economic
interest
on
the
part
of
respondent
without
regard
to
the
acceptance
to
the
government's
theory.
now,
there
are
four
factors
that
we
think
are
present
here.
one,
the
upland
owners
had
control
over
the
right
to
produce.
two,
there
was
required
and
continuing
use
of
their
property
and
production.
three,
the
operator,
southwest,
in
order
to
acquire
its
economic
interest
had
as
a
condition
precedent
to
pay
the
upland
owners
a
share
in
the
net
profits.
and
--
and
the
fourth
factor
is
the
continuing
control
which
the
upland
owners
exercised
over
the
production.i'd
like
to
take
up
each
one
of
those
points
briefly.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
under
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
under
the
broad
theory
of
burton-sutton,
it
would.
but
under
the
particular
facts
of
our
case,
that
situation
would
be
different
from
ours
because
the
property,
the
use
of
which
is
granted
for
the
net
profits
interest
is
not
used
in
production.
it's
not
used
in
the
extraction
of
the
oil
and
gas.
the
owner
of
the
property
does
not
have
any
control
over
the
right
to
produce.
the
acquisition
of
the
economic
interest
of
the
operator
is
not
--
does
not
take
place
as
a
result
of
being
required
to
pay
a
portion
of
the
net
profits
and
there
is
not
the
continuing
control
over
production
that
is
present
here
in
our
situation.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
suggest
this
important
difference.
in
order
to
get
the
right
to
produce,
southwest
had
to
pay
the
upland
owners,
the
share
of
the
profits,
just
as
it
had
to
pay
the
state
of
california
royalty.
in
our
opinion,
there
is
no
difference
in
substance
or
effect
between
the
royalty
that
southwest
had
to
pay
to
the
state
to
acquire
the
right
to
produce
and
the
share
in
the
net
profits
that
it
had
to
pay
to
the
upland
owners
in
order
to
acquire
the
right
to
produce.
in
both
cases,
those
payments
diminished
the
economic
interest
of
southwest
because
to
the
extent
that
southwest
is
required
to
pay
these
amounts
out
of
income
from
production.
it
does
not
have
that
much
income
from
production
on
which
it
could
claim
or
should
--
should
get
depletion.
well,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
take
up
these
four
points
that
i
think
represent
factors
applicable
here
requiring
the
recognition
of
our
interest,
economic
interest
whether
or
not
the
broad
rule
of
burton-sutton
or
the
broad
interpretation
of
burton-sutton
is
accepted.
the
first
one,
is
matter
of
control
over
the
right
to
produce
just
as
in
burton-sutton,
the
upland
owners
have
the
choice
of
operating
the
property
themselves
taking
and
bidding
on
the
state
lease
and
they
are
the
only
ones
eligible
if
they
chose
to.
they
chose
not
to
grant
the
use
of
their
property
to
southwest
or
permitting
someone
else
to
operate
the
property.
in
burton-sutton,
gulf
shows
not
to
operate
the
property.
it
assigned
the
lease
to
an
operator
for
sharing
the
net
profits.
and
we
contend
that
our
position
is
identical
in
effect
with
the
situation
that
gulf
had
in
burton-sutton.
on
the
second
point,
the
use
of
our
property
in
production.
the
key
to
depletion
is
an
economic
interest.
if
more
is
needed
unless
--
then
--
then
a
share
in
the
net
income
is
not
our
economic
interest
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
our
property
must
be
used
both
under
the
law
and
--
and
the
easement,
the
state
lease,
to
produce
that
oil
and
gas.
i've
discussed
the
third
point,
the
matter
of
--
of
the
--
the
payment
by
southwest
of
the
net
profits
as
a
condition
precedent
to
acquiring
its
--
its
right
to
produce.
the
fourth
element
is
the
continuing
control
that
the
upland
owners
hand
over
the
production.
at
the
time,
the
use
of
the
uplands
was
granted
to
southwest,
an
agreement
was
entered
into
which
prescribed
in
detail
how
southwest
was
to
conduct
its
operations.
it
had
to
conform
the
good
drilling
practice.
it
had
to
give
complete
information
on
the
pumps,
mechanical
condition.
it
had
to
conform
to
any
conservation
program
that
a
majority
of
the
producers
should
agree
to.
and
in
extracting
the
oil,
it
had
to
agree
to
follow
good
engineering
practice
and
those
requirements
were
essentially
the
same
as
the
requirements
that
were
laid
down
in
the
state
lease.
and
they
both
reflect
the
concern
that
one
who
has
an
interest
in
production
exercises
or
expresses
in
seeing
to
it
that
there
is
maximum
economic
recovery
from
the
oil
and
gas
to
assure
maximum
income
on
its
share
of
the
--
the
income
from
production.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
sir.
i
think
mr.
zarky
has
stated
that
insofar
as
the
regulations
express
the
view
that
a
net
profits
interest
is
not
depletable.
that
position
has
been
squarely
rejected
by
this
court
in
kirby
and
burton
sutton.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
regulations
were
issued,
your
honor,
following
elbe
and
o'donnell
and
bankline
oil.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
those
regulations
conformed
to
the
regulations
that
were
in
effect
following
elbe
and
o'donnell,
which
i
believe
were
decided
in
1939.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
--
there
has
been
no
--
no
substantial
change
in
this
portion
of
the
regulations
since
elbe,
o'donnell
and
bankline
oil.
in
these
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well,
these
regulations,
your
honor,
were
before
this
court
in
the
kirby
and
burton-sutton
cases.regulations
in
this
form
were
before
this
court
in
those
two
decisions.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
burton-sutton
case,
your
--
your
honor
knows,
it
was
decided
in
1946.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
years
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
at
any
rate,
insofar
as
they
express
the
view
that
a
net
profits
payment
is
not
depletable,
they
are
squarely
contrary
and
inconsistent
with
the
burton-sutton
decision
in
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
--
in
the
kirby
case.
and,
your
honor,
i
believe
we
referred
to
the
portion
of
the
regulations
dealing
with
the
contractual
relation
clause
in
the
preceding
sentence
on
page
48.
that
statement
does
not
reach
this
situation
because
that
regulation
pertains
to
a
taxpayer
who
has
no
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
deposit.
it
is
our
contention
that
we
had
a
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
deposit
represented
by
the
dedication
of
our
property
to
the
production
of
the
oil
and
gas.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
made
possible
by
the
california
legislation,
but
once
those
agreements
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
made
necessary,
yes,
your
honor.
but
once
those
agreements
had
been
entered
into
whereby
we
--
we
stipulate
it
for
a
share
in
the
profits,
the
legislation
could
not
deprive
us
the
benefit
of
that
agreement.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
i'd
like
to
close
it
with
this
--
with
this
point.
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
economic
realities
control
depletion.
the
economic
realities
of
this
situation
are
these.
there
are
three
interests
that
share
in
the
income
from
production.
one,
mistake
through
its
royalties.
secondly,
southwest
as
the
operator
of
the
property.
and
the
third
is
the
--
the
upland
owners
who
share
in
the
net
profits.
if
depletion
is
allowed
to
the
upland
owners,
recognition
will
be
given
of
the
economic
realities
of
this
situation
and
the
deduction
will
be
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
the
economic
interest
as
they
appear,
namely,
on
the
basis
in
which
the
parties
share
in
the
income
from
production.
