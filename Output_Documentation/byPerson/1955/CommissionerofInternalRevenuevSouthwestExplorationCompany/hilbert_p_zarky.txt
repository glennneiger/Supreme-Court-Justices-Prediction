mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
the
court
please.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
case
and
the
next
succeeding
case
both
present
one
single
income
tax
question
involving
the
statutory
right
to
depletion.
the
question
which
both
cases
pose
comes
out
of
the
following
over
simplified
situation.
the
lessee
of
an
oil
and
gas
well
is
required
to
drill
the
well
on
a
slant
and
in
drilling
the
well
it
must
go
through
the
property
of
an
adjacent
landowner.
it
obtains
the
necessary
easements
and
rights
of
way
from
the
adjacent
landowner
permitting
it
to
conduct
its
drilling
operations
in
this
manner.
as
consideration
for
those
easements,
it
undertakes
to
pay
to
the
adjacent
landowner,
a
portion
of
production
from
the
oil
and
gas
wells
measured
by
a
stipulated
percentage
of
its
net
profits
from
operations
throughout
the
life
of
the
lease.
now,
the
narrow
question
of
the
case
is
--
concerns
these
net
profit
payments
which
the
lessee
pays
to
the
adjacent
landowner.
and
the
question
is
who
is
entitled
the
reduction
for
percentage
depletion
on
those
income
payments?
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
is
the
lessee
of
the
well.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirming
the
tax
court
held
here,
not
the
adjacent
landowner
would
be
entitled
to
the
deduction.
the
taxpayer
in
the
next
succeeding
case
is
the
adjacent
landowner.
in
its
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
it,
not
the
lessee
was
entitled
to
the
deduction.
and
so,
of
the
same
transaction
we
had
two
court
decisions
which
were
an
out
and
out
conflict.
and
on
the
government's
petition
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
that
conflict.
i
said
it's
a
conflict
because
everyone
agrees
that
it's
either
the
lessee
or
the
adjacent
landowner
which
is
entitled
to
deduction
and
not
both.
now,
in
the
courts
below,
the
commissioner
who
was
faced
with
claims
of
competing
taxpayers
to
what
was
the
very
same
deduction
was
required
to
take
inconsistent
positions.
and
to
protect
the
revenue,
he
denied
the
deduction
to
both
taxpayers.
and
in
the
courts
below
we
argued
inconsistently.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
we
argued
that
the
lessee
was
not
entitled
to
deduction
and
the
court
of
claims
we
argued
the
adjacent
landowner
was
not
entitled
to
deduction.
but
now,
that
this
court
has
made
it
possible
to
have
a
harmonious
decision
in
both
cases,
the
commissioner
is
free
to
abandon
his
technical
inconsistent
position
that
he
took
in
the
court
below
and
the
commissioner
is
free
to
take
a
position
in
this
court
which
he
believes
is
the
position
legally
sound.
our
position
is
that
it
is
the
adjacent
landowner
and
not
the
lessee
to
whom
the
deduction
should
be
granted.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
it's
physically
indifferent.
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we're
worse
off
as
with
the
position
we
take
from
the
revenue
viewpoint
in
the
years
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
we're
losing
revenue
by
the
position
we
take
in
these
--
with
these
particular
taxpayers.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
we're
following
the
court
of
claims
and
disagreeing
with
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
--
that's
it,
your
honor.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
our
position
in
short
is
this.
that
when
the
adjacent
landowner
made
it
physically
possible
for
the
lessee
to
drill
for
oil
and
exploit
the
resources,
when
the
lessee
--
when
the
adjacent
landowner
made
that
possible
by
giving
necessary
rights
through
its
property
and
when
it
received
in
return
a
share
in
production
measured
by
the
lessee
in
its
profits,
it
obtained
a
depletable
interest.
to
that
extent,
mainly
to
the
extent
of
the
adjacent
landowner,
received
these
payments,
it
should
be
entitled
to
the
--
the
deduction
for
depletion.
and,
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
the
lessee
makes
these
payments,
it
may
not
include
the
payments
in
the
(inaudible)
which
it
claimed
depletion.
so
that
if
the
court
agrees
to
the
government's
position
you
will
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
and
--
and
affirm
the
court
of
claims.
and,
of
course,
if
we're
wrong
it
will
be
quite
the
reverse.
the
argument
which
we
make
is
based
on
two
principles
in
alternative
contentions.
our
first
contention
is
based
on
the
particular
and
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case.
we
say
that
when
the
adjacent
landowner
enabled
production
to
take
place
by
granting
the
necessary
rights
and
by
taking
a
share
in
net
profits,
it
came
within
the
principle
which
this
court
applied
as
we
read
kirby
petroleum
company
against
commissioner,
and
burton-sutton
against
commissioner,
the
first
in
326
u.s.
and
the
second
in
the
328
u.s.,
where
this
court
held
that
under
those
circumstances
of
those
cases
an
interest
in
net
profits
mark
a
depletable
interest
in
the
oil
and
gas.
as
i
say,
our
first
argument
is
only
because
the
adjacent
landowner
enabled
production
to
take
place.
our
alternative
argument
pays
no
heed
to
these
particular
peculiar
circumstances.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
that
the
case,
as
we
see
it,
fits
within
kirby
and
burton-sutton,
then
we
ask
if
the
case
is
to
be
decided
on
broader
principles.
namely,
that
an
interest
in
net
profits
which,
as
in
this
case,
is
coextensive
with
the
lessee's
interest
in
the
lease,
should
be
held
to
be
a
depletable
interest,
no
matter
how
it
was
acquired.
and
no
matter
from
whom
it
was
obtained.
we
are,
here,
frankly
asking
the
court
to
extend
the
decisions
in
the
kirby
and
burton-sutton
cases
in
our
alternative
argument,
a
problem
which
the
court
doesn't
reach
necessarily,
if
it
agrees
with
us
on
our
first
proposition.
now,
the
exact
circumstances
from
which
the
issue
in
both
these
cases
arises,
is
as
follows.
in
1938,
the
state
of
california
adopted
a
legislative
policy
with
respect
to
exploitation
of
the
oil
and
gas
reserves
which
were
lying
in
the
offshore
deposits.
it
provided
for
the
granting
of
state
leases
in
areas
which
were
known
to
be
producing
areas.
as
a
part
of
that
legislative
policy,
california
acted
to
protect
its
features
against
residue
oil,
that
would
be
filling
on
the
waters,
et
cetera
during
production,
by
saying
that
when
some
large
lands
were
leased
by
the
state,
drilling
should
take
place
in
one
or
two
ways.
either
the
well
should
be
drilled
from
filled
lands
or
else
the
well
should
be
slant
drilled
from
upland
owner's
property.
in
other
words,
so
that
the
production
operations
would
take
place
on
the
surface
away
from
the
beach
on
upland
properties.
it
is
stipulated
in
this
case
that
were
no
filled
lands
available
in
the
area
which
the
state
did
lease.
so
that
under
the
legislation
it
would
be
required
that
the
wells
be
slant
drilled
and
only
slant
drilled
from
adjacent
property
owners
land.
in
1938,
the
state
through
its
proper
authority
gave
notice
that
it
intended
to
lease
an
area
lying
off
huntington
beach,
california,
an
area
in
which
vertical
wells
had
been
drilled
and
had
been
producing
from
the
land
of
--
of
upland
owners.
so
that
the
state
knew
there
were
deposits
there
which
might
be
drained
by
the
vertical
wells.
in
accordance
with
state
law,
the
notice
of
the
lease
provided
that
the
wells
would
have
to
be
slant
drilled
from
the
adjacent
property
owners.
it
required
and
again
in
accordance
with
the
expressed
mandate
of
the
legislation,
that
a
bidder
for
the
lease
in
order
to
qualify
would
have
to
present
evidence
that
it
had
first
obtained
the
necessary
rights
of
way,
easements
to
permit
it
to
slant
drill
through
the
property
of
the
upland
owners
to
--
but
its
derricks,
machinery,
conduct
all
its
producing
operations
from
the
surface
of
the
upland
property.
southwest,
which
is
a
taxpayer
in
this
case,
that
prior
to
submitting
its
bid
obtained
from
certain
of
the
upland
owners,
the
necessary
easements
and
rights
of
way
which
would
permit
it
to
slant
drill
and
which
would
permit
it
to
qualify
as
a
bidder.
it
submitted
its
bill,
its
bid
having
obtained
those
easements
and
the
upland
owners,
again
in
accordance
with
state
law,
indicated
on
the
bid
by
endorsement
that
they
had
granted
those
necessary
easements
and
rights
of
way.
southwest,
obtained
the
lease
for
the
state
land
and
thereafter
it
entered
into
a
supplemental
agreement
with
some
of
the
landowners
of
which
huntington
beach,
the
taxpayer
in
the
next
case
is
one,
by
the
which,
as
consideration
for
the
easements
which
it
had
obtained,
southwest,
undertook
to
pay
a
total
of
24
1/2%
to
the
upland
owners
of
its
net
profits
from
operation
of
these
leases
during
the
life
of
the
lease.
and
as
i
indicated,
the
question
is,
as
to
the
depletable
nature
of
those
net
profit
payments
which
southwest,
the
lessee,
and
operator
of
the
well
pays
to
the
upland
owners.
in
a
very
real
sense,
taking
the
--
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1938,
in
view
of
the
provisions
that
the
state
legislature
had
made,
in
view
of
the
requirements
of
the
lease
which
southwest
had
obtained,
by
which
it
was
required
to
drill
these
wells
on
a
slant,
we
believe
that
when
the
upland
owners
gave
that
right
to
southwest,
they
gave
up
valuable
property
rights.
and
they
gave
up
property
rights
which
were
essential.
if
the
lessee
was
ever
going
to
obtain
the
bid,
it
was
going
to
produce
oil
and
gas
from
these
deposits.
and
when
the
upland
owners,
as
consideration
for
that
grant,
received
a
participation
in
the
net
profits
of
the
lessee
from
the
lease
or
the
course
of
the
lease,
we
believe
that
the
upland
owners
acquired
the
same
kind
a
depletable
interest
which
this
court
held,
a
recipient
of
the
net
profit
payments
had
in
both
the
kirby
and
the
burton-sutton
cases,
where
this
court
in
overturning
the
government's
contentions,
ruled
that
an
interest
in
net
profits
could
be
a
depletable
interest.
and
the
government
had
contented,
prior
to
both
kirby
and
burton-sutton,
that
only
an
interest
in
gross
production
could
mark
a
depletable
interest.
and
this
court
disagreed,
holding
that
an
interest
in
net
profits
was
itself
an
interest
which
could
become
exhausted,
as
the
deposits
were
exhausted
by
production.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
they
have
no
legal
interest
in
the
deposit
themselves.
and
as
i
shall
hope
to
develop
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
their
interest
to
tax
from
the
fact
that
they
were
entitled
to
share
in
the
profits
from
the
production.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
they
had
no
--
no
legal
interest
justice
minton.
we
think
that
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
is
--
that
is
probably
so.
but
we
think
there
is
--
this
is
one
which
necessarily
became
depleted,
exhausted
as
those
deposits
were
exhausted
by
production.
and
that
that
is
the
kind
of
interest
which
congress
said
should
be
subject
the
deduction
for
depletion.
have
i
answered
you?
shortly
justice
minton,
i
hope
to
develop
it
more
at
length
as
i
sketch
the
background
of
the
case.
as
we
see
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
there
are
certain
basic
principals
on
which
everyone
can
agree.
and
we
think
that
these
basic
principles
are
--
point
the
way
to
what
the
answer
should
be
in
this
case.
the
deduction
for
depletion,
of
course,
is
granted
by
congress
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
exploitation
of
mineral
deposits
involves
the
wasting
of
a
capital
asset.
and
by
annual
deductions
for
depletion,
congress
permits
parties
having
an
interest
in
the
deposit
to
recover,
tax
free,
that
interest
as
it
becomes
exhausted.
but
both
parties
are
claiming
in
the
present
case,
is
percentage
depletion,
which
congress
granted
as
a
arbitrary
and
less
complicated
way
of
calculating
the
deduction
but
which
stands
on
the
very
same
general
philosophy,
namely,
that
an
interest
is
being
depleted.
this
ought
to
be
emphasized
in
view
of
some
of
the
misapprehensions
of
perhaps
the
tax
court
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
on
the
percentage
depletion,
a
taxpayer
need
not
have
a
monetary
investment
in
the
deposits.
and
if
it
does
have
a
monetary
investment
it
will
be
entitled
to
percentage
depletion
long
after
we
capture
that
investment.
so,
the
--
the
fact
that
southwest,
that
the
upland
owners
did
not
have
a
monetary
investment
in
the
state
lands,
should
not
at
all
diminish
from
their
right
to
the
deduction.
and
in
fact,
in
a
real,
very
real
sense
by
giving
up
valuable
property
rights,
they
did
make
a
capital
investment
in
these
producing
wells.
and
that
capital
investment
will
actually
be
gone
when
the
deposits
are
exhausted
physically.
now,
this
court
has
held
consistently
through
all
the
cases
for
that
legal
title
or
a
legal
interest
in
the
underlying
deposits
is
not
essential
to
the
deduction.
that
is,
a
taxpayer
may
be
entitled
to
depletion,
even
though
under
local
law
he
is
not
regarded
as
having
a
legal
interest
or
an
interest
which
he
could
have
enforced
in
any
local
court.
the
only
important
thing
that
runs
through
the
decision
is
marking
a
taxpayer's
depletable
interest,
is
his
relationship
to
the
production
of
the
minerals.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
has
consistently
looked,
not
to
legal
title,
not
to
the
form
of
the
instrument,
the
words
used
but
to
whether
a
taxpayer
is
receiving
income
which
is
dependent
solely
upon
production
of
the
oil
and
gas.
if
he
is
receiving
that
kind
of
income,
it
is
clear
that
it
is
ultimately
will
come
to
an
end
when
the
deposit
is
exhausted.
and
if
he's
receiving
that
kind
of
income,
he
should
be
entitled
to
the
deduction
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
his
right
to
the
income
will
ultimately
come
to
an
end.
now,
if
southwest,
had
granted
the
upland
owners
here,
a
fractional
part
of
gross
production,
that
is,
if
they
had
said
to
the
upland
owners,
in
consideration
of
your
granting
us
right
through
you
property
to
drill,
to
conduct
our
production
operations
in
your
service
--
service,
we
will
give
you
one-eighth
of
all
gas
and
oil
produced
or
one-eight
of
the
proceeds
of
all
oil
and
gas
produced.
i
don't
suppose
that
anyone
could
have
any
serious
problem
but
that
the
upland
owners
had
a
depletable
interest.
it's
because
the
upland
owners
are
receiving,
not
a
share
of
gross
production,
either
in
kind
or
the
sale
value
of
it,
but
it's
because
they're
receiving
a
percentage
of
net
profits
from
production,
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
tax
court
reach
the
opposite
conclusion.
but
if
burton-sutton
and
kirby
settled
anything,
it
settled
the
fact
that
an
interest
in
net
profits
could
be
an
interest
in
production.
that
is,
that
the
recipient
must
look
to
the
production
of
the
oil
and
gas
to
recoup
his
capital
investment,
whatever
it
may
be,
and
that
it
should
be
depletable.
now,
this
is
true,
kirby
and
burton-sutton
differ
from
this
case.
in
kirby,
for
example,
the
net
profit
payments
for
being
paid
to
the
lessor,
a
lessor
in
consideration
of
granting
a
lease
to
the
oil
wells
had
reserved
a
gross
royalty
and
also
a
share
of
the
operators'
net
profits.
the
government
contended
that
only
the
gross
royalty
was
subject
to
depletion.
and
this
court
said
no.
that
both
the
gross
royalty
and
the
interest
in
net
profits
were
depletable.
burton-sutton
didn't
involve
a
lease.
it
involved
an
assignment
of
a
lease.
and
this
time,
the
transferor
of
the
lease
reserved
only
an
interest
in
net
profits.
and
the
government
there
contended
that
that
case
should
be
different
from
kirby
because
in
kirby,
when
the
lessor
reserved
both
an
interest
in
gross
production
and
an
interest
in
net
production,
the
interest
in
net
production
took
its
color
from
the
gross
royalty
in
order
to
be
depletable
along
with
the
gross
royalty.
and
again,
this
court
disagreed
and
said
it
wasn't
the
fact
that
the
lessor
had
to
deserve
the
gross
royalty
that
made
the
net
profit
interest
depletable
in
kirby
--
in
kirby.
it
was
the
fact
that
the
interest
in
gross
--
in
net
production
reserved
by
the
lessor
there,
marked
an
interest
in
production
and
was
depletable.
and
so
it
held
that
burton-sutton,
the
assignor,
had
a
depletable
interest
and
that
the
assignee
was
entitled
to
exclude
from
income
the
payments
from
its
net
profits
made
to
the
assignor.
now,
it's
clear
that
in
both
those
cases
differ
from
this
--
in
this
essential
respect.
in
both
cases
the
ultimate
operator
of
the
wells
has
obtained
the
right
to
exploit
from
the
assignor
in
burton-sutton
and
from
the
lessor
in
kirby.
and
i
assume
that
the
real
point
at
which
we
in
southwest,
come
to
clash
in
this
case
is,
what
significance
should
it
have
that
the
recipient
of
the
net
profits
in
both
those
cases
had
the
ability
to
grant
directly
the
right
to
exploit
and
that
the
upland
owners
here
did
not
have
the
right
themselves
to
drill
for
the
property,
drilling
the
property
and
exploit
the
oil
and
gas.
but
we
think,
to
begin
with,
that
the
cases
are
essentially
alike
in
this
respect,
that
very
practical
sense
what
the
upland
owners
here
gave
the
lessee
was
as
much
essential
to
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
as
well
as
the
right
to
drill
in
kirby
and
burton-sutton
because
without
the
assent
of
the
upland
owners,
that
is
without
their
granting
their
right
to
the
lessee
to
go
through
their
property,
the
lessee
couldn't
qualify
for
the
merits.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
granting
the
easement
it
was
the
upland
owners
who
were
the
only
parties
in
a
position
to
bid
for
the
state
lease.
and
when
they
granted
that
right
to
southwest,
they
put
southwest
in
the
position
where
it
could
drill
for
the
oil
and
gas.
but
the
cases
are
alike
in
a
not
very
essential
respect,
too.
namely,
that
in
burton-sutton,
what
you
had
as
i
said
was
an
assignment
of
the
lease,
except
for
a
personal
covenant
to
require
a
re-conveyance
of
the
property
if
the
operator
didn't
operate
the
property,
the
assignor
in
burton-sutton
after
the
assignment
had
no
present
interest
in
the
property,
no
present
legal
interest.
the
only
relationship
which
the
assignor
after
the
assignment
in
burton-sutton
had,
was
the
right
to
receive
a
stipulated
percentage
of
the
net
profits
from
the
production
of
the
oil
and
gas.
and
so
that
in
those
two
respects
the
upland
owners
here
stand
in
the
same
position
that
the
assignor
did
in
burton-sutton,
namely,
after
the
transfer,
both
parties
are
entitled
to
receive
a
portion
of
production
measured
by
net
profits.
in
both
cases
neither
of
the
recipients
had
any
present
interest
in
the
producing
wells
and
so
that
we
think
in
those
essential
respects,
this
case
falls
within
burton-sutton
in
order
to
be
governed
by
decision
there.
now,
burton-sutton,
i'd
like
to
point
out,
was
not
unique,
involving
a
situation
where
the
party
receiving
the
payments,
had
made
an
out
and
out
transfer
of
all
his
property
rights.
the
first
case,
which
reached
this
court,
involving
a
similar
situation
was
palmer
v.
bender,
cited
back
1933,
opinion
written
by
justice
stone.
now,
in
palmer
against
bender,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
this
because
this
is
a
juncture
in
which
the
taxpayer
and
the
government
failed
to
see
eye
to
eye.
in
palmer
v.
bender,
you
had
louisiana
leases
of
issue.
there
had
been
a
transfer
of
those
leases.
and
the
question
was
whether
there
had
been
a
sale
of
the
property
or
whether
by
reserving
royalties
the
--
there
had
been
a
retention
of
an
interest
which
was
depletable.
the
government
argued
very
strenuously
in
that
case
that
the
particular
forms
of
the
instrument
on
a
louisiana
law
amounted
to
an
out
and
out
transfer
with
no
retention
of
an
interest.
and
the
taxpayer
in
palmer
v.
bender
argued
just
as
strenuously
the
other
way,
that
under
louisiana
law,
the
reservation
of
a
royalty
meant
that
there
was
a
sub
lease
and
a
reversionary
interest.
and
that
the
case
should
be
regarded
as
a
retention
of
a
depletable
interest.
this
court
said
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
under
the
louisiana
law
the
transfers
were
assignments
or
whether
they
were
subleases.
justice
stone's
opinion
says,
we
look
--
don't
look
to
local
law
to
measure
what
congress
has
granted.
we
look
to
the
practical
effects,
what
the
provisions
for
payment
are.
when
the
transferor
in
the
palmer
bender
case
had
reserved
a
gross
royalty,
that
meant
a
continued
share
in
production
from
the
oil
and
gas
wells.
and
that
continued
interest
in
production
meant
that
there
could
be
no
out
and
out
sale.
that
there
had
to
be
at
the
retention
of
a
depletable
interest.
the
next
--
next
situation
that
came
up
involving
that
precise
problem
was
thomas
v.
perkins,
in
the
301
u.s.
again,
there
was
an
out
and
out
transfer.
and
unlike
palmer
v.
bender,
and
burton-sutton,
i
couldn't
even
find
a
personal
covenant
to
re-convey
in
the
event
the
lessee
didn't
exploit
the
leases.
and
in
thomas
against
perkins,
unlike
palmer
bender,
there
was
a
reservation
of
an
oil
payment.
that
is
a
stipulated
sum
of
money
payable
out
of
the
oil
and
gas
produced.
and
again,
in
the
phase
of
the
contention
that
by
the
assignment
there
had
been
a
transfer
of
the
property
so
that
no
depletable
interest
remained
of
the
transferor,
this
court
held
no,
that
the
oil
payment
marked
the
continued
interest
in
the
property
which
was
depletable.
and
again,
as
i
said,
in
burton-sutton,
we
had
another
transfer
where
the
retention
of
an
interest
in
net
profits
was
held
to
be
a
depletable
interest.
now,
when
you
take
the
three
cases
together,
it
seems
to
us
it
means
this.
we
don't
look
to
see
whether
the
transferor
retained
a
legal
interest
under
local
law.
we
don't
have
to
look
to
see
whether
the
upland
owners
here
received
a
legal
interest
under
local
law.
so
long
as
they
stood
in
a
position
where
they
enabled
production
to
take
place
and
so
long
as
they
received
the
kind
of
payments
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
depletable,
then
we
think
that
it
follows
that
the
upland
owners
must
be
held
they're
entitled
to
a
depletable
interest.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
they
get,
dollar-wise
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
right.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
correct.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
24
1/2%
total
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
17
to
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
you
follow
judge
madison
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
in
computing
his
income,
take
the
lessee
first.
it
would
exclude
from
its
income
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
to
one
of
the
upland
owners
which
is
huntington
beach
in
that
case.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
right.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i'll
have
to
answer
in
different
way,
justice
black,
because
it
depends
on
the
computations
on
the
taxpayer.
on
the
amounts
which
--
which
the
upland
owner
gets,
it
would
be
entitled
for
the
deduction
of
27
1/2%
of
the
dollars
which
it
receives.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
from
--
from
some
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes,
except
for
the
amount
that
it
pays
the
state
of
california.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
the
result
the
consequence
of
judge
madison's
opinion.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
correct.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
in
other
words,
if
we
forget
the
state
of
california,
the
lessee
will,
under
one
decision,
get
the
full
allowance.
that's
out
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
he
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
would
--
would
--
wouldn't
get
anything
under
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
under
the
court
of
claims'
opinion,
the
lessee
would
get
it
on
everything
except
what
it
pays
the
adjacent
landowner.
and
the
adjacent
landowner
would
get
it
on
the
actual
dollars
which
it
received.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
not
necessarily.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
depletion
allowance
is
27
1/2%
of
the
gross
income
from
the
property,
but
not
to
exceed
50%
of
the
net
income
from
the
property.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
upland
owners,
every
dollar
which
they
get
is
both
their
gross,
and
assuming
no
expenses,
their
net
income.
so
that
50%
limitation
would
not
apply.
but
in
the
case
of
southwest,
that
50%
limitation
might
in
some
years
be
a
very
real
guideline.
so
that
they
would
not
get
the
full
27
1/2%.
i
think
--
i
--
i
don't
know
their
tax
computation.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
27
1/2%
on
their
gross
income,
but
not
to
exceed
50%
of
their
net
income
from
that
property.
i
don't
know
if
i
make
myself
clear,
justice
black.
it's
not
very
easy.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
without
knowing
the
precise
tax
computations
which
lessee
has,
i
would
not
know
that
that
50%
limitation
comes
into
play
or
not.
but
that's
the
statutory
limitation
on
the
overall
amount
of
percentage
depletion
deduction
which
a
particular
tax
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
$100,000
which
is
paid
to
the
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
sorry,
justice
black
that
that
begs
the
question.
you
must
start
out.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
it
isn't
possible
to
say
there's
$100,000
worth
of
depletion.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
there'd
be
a
100
--
let's
say
the
gross
--
the
gross
proceeds
from
the
well
is
$100.
then
the
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
27
1/2%
of
that,
but
not
to
exceed
50%
of
the
net
--
the
net
property.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
then
assuming
everything
else
to
be
same,
17
1/2%
would
go
to
huntington
beach,
other
upland
owners
would
get
up
to
24
1/2%,
the
rest
would
be
to
southwest
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
just
--
just
to
simply
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
under
ninth
circuit
formula,
southwest
would
get
it
all.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
our
--
our
contention.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
my
rebuttal
time
is
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
expired.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
the
court
please,
this
is
the
companion
case
to
the
southwest
exploration
company
argument.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
is
one
of
the
upland
owners,
huntington
beach
company.
and
the
court
of
claims
held
that
it
was
entitled
to
depletion
on
the
income
payments
which
southwest
company
had
made
to
it.
just
to
clarify
what
the
situation
is
with
respect
to
the
division
of
the
allowance
the
year
here
involved
was
1948
and
in
that
year
the
gross
income,
which
southwest
had
obtained
from
the
leases,
was
approximately
$20,000,000.
after
deducting
it,
its
expenses,
it
had
a
net
income
of
some
$7,300,000
of
which
it
had
paid
to
huntington
beach,
$1,300,000,
maybe
it
share
of
the
net
profits.
now,
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
correct
in
the
southwest
case,
southwest
would
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
based
on
the
entire
$20,000,000
of
income
it
obtained
from
the
property.
so
that
its
actual
depletion
deduction
would
be
about
$5,500,000.
now,
if
the
court
of
claims
is
correct,
then
out
of
the
southwest
$20,000,000,
it
must
exclude
the
$1,300,000
it
paid
to
the
upland
owner
here.
so
that
its
depletion
base
would
be
$18,700,000
instead
of
$20,000,000
and
the
depletion
base
of
huntington
beach
would
be
$1,300,000,
the
net
profit
payments
which
it
received.
the
court
of
claims
in
holding
that
huntington
beach
had
a
depletable
interest
followed
what
is
our
first
alternative
argument,
namely,
that
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
upland
owners
had
contributed
valuable
rights
which
enabled
production
to
take
place
and
that
they
have
received
a
depletable
interest
in
the
form
of
net
profit
payments
which
became
within
the
rationality
of
burton-sutton
and
kirby.
that
i
--
the
court
of
claims
gave
a
practical
example,
which
i
think
is
very
persuasive,
it
posed
this
hypothetical
situation
that
imagine
that
the
owner
of
land
had
given
an
easement
for
a
golf
course
permitting
it
to
use
the
surface
of
the
land,
so
that
the
golf
club
had
complete
rights
with
respect
to
that
surface.
and
that
thereafter,
minerals
were
discovered
to
underlie
the
surface
and
the
owner
of
the
property
had
given
a
mineral
deed
to
a
third
party.
but
that
third
party
cannot
exploit
the
minerals
without
digging
through
the
surface
of
the
land
and
so
he
must
turn
to
the
golf
club
to
obtain
the
necessary
property
rights
to
permit
that
to
take
place.
so,
the
court
of
claims
says,
suppose
that
the
owner
of
the
mineral
rights
now
deals
with
the
owner
of
the
surface
or
the
person
who
has
an
easement
with
the
surface
and
obtains
the
right
to
break
through
the
surface
and
will
pay
for
the
life
of
mineral
lease
a
portion
of
the
net
profits
from
production.
court
of
claims
assumed
that
that
would
be
an
easy
case
that
the
owner
of
the
surface
ought
to
have
the
deduction
for
depletion.
“and,”
said
the
court
of
claims
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
claims,
“this
case
should
be
no
different
that
the
upland
owners
do
not
have
their
property
immediately
and
physically
above
the
mineral
deposits
and
that
the
physical
mineral
deposit
lies
at
an
angle.”
the
important
thing
is
that
their
property
is
being
used
and
their
property
is
enabling
the
production
to
take
place.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes,
sir.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
was
just
going
to
that,
mr.
justice
burton.
as
a
background,
i
must
talk
about
three
cases,
which
have
preceded
kirby
and
burton-sutton,
and
which
the
court
of
claims
and
we
distinguished
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
that
was
a
trilogy
of
cases
all
reported
in
the
303
u.s.
one
case
is
helvering
v.
o'donnell.
the
taxpayer
in
that
case
own
one-third
of
the
stock
in
a
corporation
that
had
oil
and
gas
leases.
he
sold
his
stock
to
another
corporation
which
undertook
to
acquire
the
oil
properties
from
the
first
corporation
and
as
consideration
for
the
stock
which
it
acquired
was
going
to
pay
mr.
o'donnell
one-third
of
the
net
profits
from
its
production
after
it
acquired
the
oil
properties.
this
court
held
that
the
net
profit
payments
received
by
the
selling
stockholder
were
not
depletable.
the
next
case
is
elbe
oil
land.
there,
the
owner
of
oil-bearing
property
had
transferred
it
for
a
large
dated
consideration,
partly
payable
immediately
and
partly
payable
in
installments
in
the
future
if
the
transferee
elected
not
to
abandon
the
transaction.
in
addition,
the
transferee
undertook
to
pay
to
the
transferor
a
percentage
of
its
net
profits
after
it
had
recouped
its
entire
investment
including
this
purchase
price
which
it
had
paid
for
the
property.
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
the
installment
payments
were
themselves
subject
to
depletion
or
whether
they
were
sales
profits.
there
having
been
no
net
profits
paid
in
that
case.
and
the
third
case
is
helvering
v.
bankline
oil
company
where
the
taxpayer
had
a
contract
with
a
lessee
of
the
wells
to
buy
the
gas
as
it
float
in
the
wells
and
to
process
it
making
natural
gas
and
gasoline.
and
in
bankline,
the
taxpayer
claimed
that
it
was
buying
under
its
contract,
the
gas
at
a
favorable
price
less
than
market
price
and
then
it
should
be
entitled
to
depletion
on
the
difference
between
the
price
that
paid
under
the
contract
and
the
price
which
it
would
have
paid
and
had
it
been
buying
at
market
price.
now,
we
distinguish
those
three
cases
on
the
ground
that,
and
none
of
them
as
here,
was
the
party
receiving
the
net
profit
payments,
doing
anything
essential
to
the
production
of
oil
and
gas.
when
the
stockholders
sold
his
stock
in
o'donnell,
he
wasn't
like
the
upland
owners
here
enabling
the
lessee
to
get
to
the
property,
except
in
a
more
--
most
indirect
sense.
elbe
itself
is
peculiar
because
you
were
trying
to
test
whether
there
was
a
sale
measured
by
the
fact
that
the
net
profit
payments
had
been
retained
and
this
court
said
that
interest
was
not
one
which
qualify
the
sale
in
anyway.
and
indeed
in
burton-sutton,
the
court
indicated
that
elbe
should
not
be
extended
beyond
its
facts.
and
bankline
represented
nearly
a
favorable
contract
to
purchase.
now,
to
get
more
to
the
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
burton,
for
those
trilogy
of
cases,
the
treasury
amended
its
regulations
immediately
thereafter
to
provide
that
a
favorable
contract
and
interest
in
net
profits
is
not
a
depletable
interest.
and
the
government
so
thought
that's
what
the
three
cases
stood
for.
and
that's
why
when
kirby
and
burton-sutton
was
here,
the
government
relying
on
those
regulations
contented
very
rigorously
that
nothing
short
of
an
interest
in
gross
production
could
be
depletable
and
that
an
interest
in
net
production
or
net
profits
could
not
be
depletable.
this
court,
of
course,
held
to
the
contrary
in
both
cases.
so
that
this
court
in
effect
did
not
feel
that
the
regulations
was
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
to
the
extent
that
the
regulations
say
that
an
interest
in
net
profits
is
not
a
depletable
or
economic
interest
in
the
property.
the
regulations
are
in
contradiction
to
what
kirby
and
burton-sutton
held.
and
my
understanding
is
that
under
the
new
code,
the
proposed
treasury
regulations
contemplate
omitting
that
particular
sentence
in
order
to
have
the
regulations
conform
to
the
kirby
and
burton-sutton
cases.
so
that
actually
to
the
extent
that
the
argument
rests
here
on
the
regulations
is
the
very
same
argument
which
the
government
twice
advanced
unsuccessfully
in
this
very
tribunal.
so
that
we
do
not
feel
that
the
regulations
at
all
point
to
the
fact
that
the
upland
owners
cannot
have
a
depletable
interest.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
ran
down
some
of
the
arguments,
which
the
ninth
circuit
accepted,
to
indicate
why
we
think
they
are
wrong.
to
a
large
extent,
the
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
kirby.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
not
in
burton-sutton,
your
honor.
i
say
this
for
this
reason,
prior
to
the
transfer
in
kirby
and
burton-sutton,
there
was
a
difference
because
the
transferor
stood
in
a
position
where
they
could
exploit
the
minerals.
but
after
the
transfer
in
burton-sutton,
gulf,
the
assignor,
had
no
further
interest,
any
further
legal
interest,
in
the
minerals
in
place.
so
far
as
gulf
was
concerned,
it
was
as
much
a
stranger
to
what
was
taking
place
after
the
less
--
after
the
assignment
than
the
upland
owners
here.
but
gulf
did
have
an
interest
and
that's
what
this
court
held
was
important.
it
maintained
an
interest
by
having
reserved
the
share
of
the
net
profits
of
the
operator
and
it
was
that
economic
interest
which
this
court
said
having
them
retained
by
gulf.
it
meant
that
gulf
must
look
to
the
depletion
allowance
to
recover
whatever
capital
investment
it
had
in
the
minerals
in
place.
so
we
feel
that
this
case
stands
just
like
burton-sutton.
there
have
been
arguments
made
which
indicate
that
authorities,
that
burton-sutton
is
different
because,
for
example,
there
was
a
covenant
there
to
reconvey
to
the
assignor
if
the
assignee
didn't
develop
the
property.
there
have
been
arguments
in
here
that
this
is
not
a
rent
or
royalty.
this
is
a
personal
covenant
of
southwest.
but
the
fifth
circuit,
you
will
recall,
decided
burton-sutton
in
the
government's
favor.
it
had
held
that
--
and
that
profit
payments
were
not
depletable
and
the
fifth
circuit
did
so
on
the
very
philosophy
that
that
was
a
personal
covenant
that
the
assignor
had
no
interest
in
the
minerals
and
this
had
followed
the
previous
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit.
so
that
so
far
as
the
legal
interest
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
upland
owners
here
stand
in
the
same
--
almost
the
same
situation
if
the
assignor
did
in
burton-sutton
after
the
assignment.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
think
that
those
regulations
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
how
i
would
distinguish
the
present
peculiar
situation
from
helvering
and
o'donnell,
elbe
oil
land
and
bankline.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
but
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
think
that
the
regulations
and
i'm
puzzled
by
just
what
they
can
mean
today
after
burton-sutton
and
kirby.
treasury
thought
that
the
trilogy
o'donnell,
elbe
and
the
bankline
stood
flattened
for
the
proposition
that
no
interests
in
their
profits
could
ever
be
depletable
whether
reserved
by
the
lessor,
reserved
by
an
assignor
or
acquired
by
stranger.
now,
we
know
that
that
isn't
so
that
at
least
in
the
lessor
and
the
--
and
the
assignor
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
the
upland
owners
here.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
well,
the
regulations
were
not
written
with
that
in
mind.
they
were
written
in
--
in
mind
that
there
was
a
flat
rule
of
law,
net
profits,
no
depletion,
no
matter
how
you
acquire
it.
and
they
were
written,
of
course,
before
the
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
kirby
and
burton-sutton
so
that
they
must
be
regarded
as
--
to
a
large
extent
distinguished
by
what
kirby
and
burton-sutton
held.
so
that
to
the
extent,
the
arguments
here
are
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
legal
title
for
the
minerals,
that
there
were
no
reversionary
interest,
no
right
to
drill
in
the
upland
owners,
that
there
was
a
personal
covenant
that
the
regulations
governed
it.
all
those
are
arguments
which
the
government
had
advanced
and
which
this
court
rejected
in
kirby
and
burton-sutton.
and
we
think
that
the
same
arguments
are
really
being
resurrected
here
today
to
achieve
the
result
which
this
court
said
is
not
the
law
in
those
two
cases.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
that
too,
justice
black.
but
there
are
many
instances
where
the
administrator
just
have
too
many
things
to
do
and
don't
get
around
to
it
fast
enough.
but
the
position,
which
we
take
here
today,
is
taken
advisably
with
the
commissioner's
acquiescence
so
that
this
--
does
reflect
the
present
position
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
suppose
that
one
had
nothing
else
to
do,
it
would
be
very
fast.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
they
didn't
take
it
up
with
me.
that
was
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
when
we're
through
litigating
for
the
--
for
the
client,
then
we're
through
with
it.
we
have
no
authority
to
--
to
change
the
regulations
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
thought
may
well
have
been
that
kirby
and
burton-sutton
spoke
for
themselves
and
that
exactly
where
the
line
should
be
drawn
was
not
too
clear,
but
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
regulations
make
the
flat
blunt
statement.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
part
here,
“thus,
an
agreement
between
the
owner
of
an
economic
interest
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
on
page
48
of
the
government's
brief
in
southwest.
i'm
not
sure
we
reproduced
it
in
huntington
beach.
“thus,
an
agreement
between
the
owner
of
an
economic
interest
and
another
entitling
the
latter
to
purchase
the
product
upon
production.”
that
part
we
think
is
good
law.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
“thus,
an
agreement
between
the
owner
of
an
economic
interest,
and
another
at
the
last
final
paragraph,
entitling
the
latter
to
purchase
the
product
upon
production.”
we
think
that
that
is
good
law
under
bankline.
“or
to
share
in
the
net
income
derived
from
the
interests
of
such
owner
does
not
convey
a
depletable
economic
interest.”
that
we
think
is
bad
law
under
kirby
and
burton-sutton.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
the
bureau
--
the
internal
revenue
service
is
now
preparing
regulations
under
the
new
1954
code
which
didn't
change
the
basic
statute
from
the
39
code.
and
it's
a
long
time
consuming
process
to
get
out
all
the
details.
they
are
far
from
being
ready
for
approval.
but
my
understanding
is
that
internal
revenue
service
intends
to
delete
that
last
part
of
the
sentence.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
pass
to
our
alternative
argument,
which
is
that
without
regard
to
whether
or
how
the
upland
owners
acquired
this
interest
in
net
profits.
we
ask
the
court
to
hold
that
it
had
an
economic
interest.
now,
we
recognized,
we're
asking
the
court
to
go
beyond
what
was
decided
in
kirby
and
burton-sutton.
now,
we
think
we're
asking
for
a
sensible
logical
extension
of
those
cases
to
make
a
workable
rule.
an
interest
in
gross
production
is
obtained
by
the
life
of
the
lease
like
a
gross
royalty.
that's
depletable
no
matter
who
has
it
or
how
he
obtained
it.
and
its
common
in
the
industry
for
the
lessor
to
fragment
his
reserved
royalty
and
sell
it
to
others
and
its
common
for
the
lessee
to
fragment
his
interest
by
granting
overriding
royalty.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
by
--
in
many
situation,
you
will
find
hundreds
of
people
having
minute
fraction
of
the
right
to
--
every
barrel
of
oil
produced
or
the
proceeds
from
their
sale.
and
no
one
doubts
that
those
interests
are
depletable
so
long
as
they're
(inaudible)
with
the
lease
no
matter
how
they
go,
whether
by
sale,
assignment,
by
inheritance
just
so
long
as
the
party
who
has
the
interest
has
an
interest
in
gross
production
that
is
depletable.
now,
the
question
we
pose
is,
if
as
kirby
and
burton-sutton
hold
an
interest
in
net
profits
is
so
like
an
interest
in
gross
production
as
to
be
depletable
in
the
circumstances
of
those
cases,
should
not
the
same
rule
apply
to
an
interest
in
net
profits
no
matter
how
its
conveyed
or
to
whom
its
conveyed
or
how
its
obtained.
that
is
if
the
lessor
or
assignor
and
kirby
and
burton-sutton
having
retained
an
interest
in
net
profits
is
entitled
to
depletion.
shouldn't
a
transferee
for
cash
consideration,
donation
by
gift,
by
inheritance,
shouldn't
the
transferee
stand
in
the
same
position
that
the
transferor
did?
and
if
that
interest
can
be
carved
out
by
the
lessor,
why
shouldn't
the
lessee
be
able
to
carve
it
out,
just
as
the
lessee
can
grant
an
interest
in
gross
production
by
an
overwriting
royalty,
why
shouldn't
the
lessee
be
able
to
sell
an
in
interest
in
net
profits
and
convey
depletable
interest
even
if
it's
for
a
cash
consideration.
this
would
be
a
simple
rule.
it
would
be
a
workable
rule.
everyone
would
know
precisely
where
everyone
stands.
if
you
didn't
have
to
concern
yourself
with
whether
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case
or
another
case
fitted
in
to
the
rationality
of
kirby
and
burton-sutton.
if
the
court
agrees
with
us,
then
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
upland
owners
obtained
this
interest
by
conveying
an
interest
in
their
property.
it
could
be
consider
just
as
though
the
upland
owners
had
bought
for
cash
from
southwest
the
right
to
receive
24.5%
of
its
net
profits
for
the
term
of
the
lease.
and
that
ought
to
be
as
depletable
in
the
hands
of
the
upland
owners
as
if
for
cash,
they
had
bought
the
right
to
receive
one-eighth
of
gross
production
from
the
leases.
in
other
words,
if
this
court
will
put
them
both
on
the
same
basis
so
that
an
interest
in
net
profits
which
stand
precisely
as
an
interest
in
gross
production,
we
think
that
we
have
a
logical
extension
in
the
two
case
and
would
have
a
rule
which
would
make
for
more
uniform
results
and
would
be
administratively
a
lot
more
workable
and
taxpayers
would
be
able
to
predict
where
they
stand
rather
than
having
to
worry
about
whether
particular
circumstances
do
or
do
not
fall
within
the
share
or
reliance
of
kirby
and
burton-sutton.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
all
right.
may
i
just
comment
on
the
regulations?
the
existing
regulations
were
amended
by
a
treasury
decision
as
i
recall
in
the
early
part
of
1940
to
reflect
the
o'donnell,
elbe
and
bankline
cases.
now,
your
honor
is
correct
that
those
regulations
were
not
applicable
in
burton-sutton
but
they
were
the
regulations
applicable
in
kirby,
and
you
will
find
it
in
footnote
4
of
the
kirby
opinion,
a
quotation
from
the
regulations
which
include
that
disputed
sentence.
now,
of
course,
in
both
burton-sutton
and
in
kirby,
we
were
contending
that
the
regulations
were
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
had
all
along
remained
unchanged
so
that
our
position
had
been
calling
that
the
applicable
regulation
were
governing
in
kirby
and
that
what
they
stated
was
the
correct
rule
of
law
not
only
because
they
governed
those
particular
years,
but
because
there
were
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
has
remained
unchanged
all
the
way
through.
and
as,
your
honor,
may
recall
in
burton-sutton,
the
court,
in
speaking
of
the
regulations,
broadly
said
that
they're
not
very
helpful.
they
tell
us
what
to
do
once
you
decided
what
is
a
rent
or
royalty
but
they
don't
tell
us
what
is
a
rent
or
royalty.and
in
--
the
net
profit
payment
regulation
was
intended
to
be
specific.
after
kirby
and
burton-sutton,
we
think
they
are
equally
unhelpful
in
deciding
the
issue
posed
by
this
case
because,
had
the
regulations
been
applied
literally.
i
think
the
government
should
have
prevailed
in
both
kirby
and
burton-sutton
because
to
the
extent
that
they
say
that
an
interest
in
net
profits
is
not
an
economic
interest.that
was
precisely
what
the
court
held
was
not
true
in
both
kirby
and
burton-sutton.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sorry,
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
no,
we
took
the
opposite
side
in
the
court
of
claims.
we
argued
very
--
as
rigorously
as
we
could
by
the
same
contention
which
southwest
makes
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
we
took
one
position
in
ninth
circuit.
we
took
the
opposite
position
in
the
court
of
claims
and
lost
both
of
them.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
we
--
we
were
persuasive
no
matter
which
--
which
side
we
argue
that.
[laughs]
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes,
that's
before
we
took
a
tactical
inconsistent
position
because
we
had
to.
but
now
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
court
of
claims,
we
believe,
should
be
affirmed
to
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right
and
we
agreed
that
one
of
the
two
parties
must
get
it
and
we
also
contend
that
both
of
them
can
have
it.
