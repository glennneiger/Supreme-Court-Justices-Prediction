justice
stanley
reed
but
before
--
before
you
leave
the
regulation,
isn't
--
isn't
there
a
difference
between
the
interest
in
the
--
in
the
burton-sutton
and
the
--
the
--
what's
the
other
case,
kirby?
justice
stanley
reed
--
different
interests
of
what
we
have
here?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
do
you
--
do
you
interpret
the
regulation
where
it
says
thus
an
economic
that
it
does
not
possess
an
economic
interest
merely
because
the
factual
relation
with
the
owner
that
that's
an
economic
offense?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
solely
as
a
contract
entirely
apart
from
many
power
that
the
landowner
has
to
--
to
give
access
to
or
not
to
give
access
to
the
owner,
is
it
--
is
that
what
distinguishes
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
cases
from
the
others?
justice
stanley
reed
but
i'm
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
to
recognize
by
--
and
this
regulation
itself.
justice
stanley
reed
which
profits,
comes
from
a
--
from
a
power
over
the
land
itself
and
over
the
way
to
get
to
the
oil,
will
that
distinguish
it?
justice
stanley
reed
i'm
speaking
now
with
the
regulations.
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
horrow,
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
regulations
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
well,
do
you
--
are
you
familiar
when
those
regulations
were
issued?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
the
reason
i
was
asking
that
was
because
the
government
brief
says,
treasury
regulations
(inaudible)
were
promulgated
under
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
justice
stanley
reed
but
in
--
in
burton-sutton,
the
treasury
regulation
referred
to,
regular
--
treasury
regulations
of
1994.
justice
stanley
reed
but
were
they
--
what
in
the
preceding
regulations
was
--
was
this
the
same
regulation
in
the
preceding
regulation?
justice
stanley
reed
they're
--
they
may
have
been
but
they
--
if
--
if
the
government
is
correct
in
saying
the
petitioner
promulgated
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
if
i
take
it
what
they
are,
then
they
didn't
cover
the
years
1936,
1937
and
1938
which
burton-sutton
covers.
so
that
--
if
--
if
i'm
--
if
that
is
correct,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
not,
i
merely
notice
that
these
regulations
weren't
referred
to
in
burton-sutton
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
and
when
--
and
when
these
were
promulgated
in
1939,
burton-sutton
covered
1936,
1937
and
1938
and
we
would
have
the
issuance
of
these
regulations
after
burton-sutton.
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
and
also,
it
covers
fiscal
year's
ending
in
1936,
1937
and
1938.
perhaps,
mr.
zarky
knows
about
the
plaintiff
--
the
economics
of
the
later
years.
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
i
--
i
was
assuming
you
answered
the
question.
justice
stanley
reed
as
supported
by
the
california
legislation.
justice
stanley
reed
made
--
made
necessary
with
california.
justice
stanley
reed
perhaps
you'll
--
