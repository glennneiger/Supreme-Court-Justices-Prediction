how
much
would
they
get?
i
can't
understand
all
those
cases.
i
want
to
find
out
how
much
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
mean
is
this.
as
i
understand
it
they
had
this
depletable
ownership
there,
whatever
california
had
given.
gave
it
to
this
man
and
he
had
to
get
permission
from
the
upland
man
to
put
a
pipe
through
there
or
something
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
both
of
them
were
sanctioned
in
order
to
get
their
oil
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
out
without
it.
as
i
understand
it
these
upland
people,
according
to
their
contract
in
agreement,
were
to
get
17
1/2%
of
the
net
profit,
all
through
the
term
of
taking
that
oil
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
now,
how
much,
if
you
follow
judge
madison,
how
much
would
each
one
get
of
the
depletion
allowed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
second
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
it
not
from
--
but
that's
--
that's
getting
me
mixed
up.
so,
what
i
want
to
get
at
is,
as
--
as
i
read
it,
maybe
i'm
am
wrong,
maybe
it
is
too
simple
to
my
mind
and
that's
what
i
meant.
as
i
understood
it
is
what
is
that
17
3/4%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
that
meant
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
did
he
get
it
so
long
as
that'd
keep
oil
coming
out
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
percentage
of
the
depletion
would
he
get,
17
3/4%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
--
if
only
of
the
dollars
it
receives.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
what
the
other
--
now,
that's
what
i'm
getting.
would
the
other
man
who
had
traded
whether
he
gets
the
remainder
of
the
100
cents
on
the
dollar
of
that
depletion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
would
have
a
--a
division.
suppose
they
were
partners.
one
of
them
had
17
3/4%
and
was
up
on
the
other
of
the
end
of
wing.
under
the
depletion
of
that,
each
one
would
get
80%,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
result
of
judge
madison's
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
we
cannot
--
we
can
know
that
whatever
we've
decided
in
the
other
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
each
one
gets
the
percentage
according
to
the
average
he
will
get
between
now
and
the
time
it's
all
depleted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
upland
man,
who
has
--
who's
getting
17
3/4%
until
it's
all
over
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
wouldn't
get
any
depletion
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
the
actual
result
they
either
claim,
though
instead
of
having
this
arrangement,
they
were
part,
one
having
17
3/4,
and
the
other
the
remainder
of
the
percentage.
under
judge
madison's,
opinion
is
that
the
way
it
would
be
divided
the
depletion
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
--
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
27
1/2%
on
their
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
are
$100,000
depletion
in
one
year,
how
do
they
divide
it
under
the
madison
point
of
view?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
care
who
it's
paid
to.
$100,000
depletion
as
a
whole.
that's
what
is
paid
on
depletion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
maybe
it
does,
but
is
that
--
is
it
possible
to
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
might
be
--
it's
possible
that
there
might
be
a
$100,000
paid,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
depletion
would
be
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
taking
all
that
out,
it
was
$20,000.
how
much
would
each
one
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
with
madison
formula.
on
the
other,
southwest
would
get
it
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
said,
under
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
those
regulations
were
denied
by
the
court
opinion,
why
have
they'd
been
left
standing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
does
it
take
him
to
take
into
regulation
back
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
meant
was,
they've
evidently
taking
it
up
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
you
take
up
with
them?
have
you
taken
up
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it,
but
i
wondered
why
when
you
call
--
when
their
attention
was
called
to
it
that
some
steps
were
not
taken
and
you
changed
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
which
part
of
this
regulation
do
you
consider
is
out
by
reason
of
kirby
and
sutton?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
part
that
justice
reed
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
brief,
where
is
that
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
thus,
where
is
that
now,
page
48?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
last
quote?
