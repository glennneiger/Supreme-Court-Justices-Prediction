mr.
melvin
d.
wilson
if
the
court
please.
our
viewpoint
of
some
of
the
facts
and
some
of
the
law
are
somewhat
different.
instead
of
the
state
law
and
state
lease
in
contending
the
upland
owners
to
be
beneficiaries,
we
think
they
were
the
target
of
the
1938
state
lands
act.
the
only
legislation
in
california
prior
to
this
1938
legislation
which
permitted
state
officials
to
lease
state
oil
reserves
was
a
1921
act
and
some
minor
amendments
thereafter.
now,
that
act,
limited
the
state
to
give
exploratory
permits
on
--
for
wildcatting,
where
there
were
not
on
--
in
areas
not
known
to
be
geologic
structures.
therefore
the
--
by
1938,
there
were
a
lot
of
wells,
shoreline
wells
drilled
along
the
shores
of
california
in
particular
at
huntington
beach.
they,
of
course,
proved
up
the
tidelands.
proved
that
those
were
geologic
structures
near
the
shoreline
wells,
but
the
state
couldn't
lease
those
wells
and
--
and
cause
offset
wells
to
be
drilled.
now,
those
upland
owners
were
draining
the
tidelands
of
the
state.
but
the
state
couldn't
stop
them
because
that's
the
case
law
that
the
law
--
the
nature
of
oil
is
such
that
if
the
well
doesn't
encroach
on
the
other
fellow's
property,
he
can
get
that
incidental
draining
without
being
stopped
by
the
court.
and
california
could
not
--
could
not
lease
these
mineral
resources
under
the
waters
and
drill
offset
wells
to
stop
that
drains
because
the
state
law
didn't
permit
it.
so,
the
purpose
of
this
state
law
was
to
enable
a
state
to
get
--
to
stop
that
drainage.
and
it
took
command
over
the
uplands
for
that
very
purpose.
the
upland
owners
were
the
targets
of
that
law,
and
not
the
beneficiaries
of
it.
the
law,
of
course,
armed
the
--
authorized
the
appointment
of
state
lands
commission,
who
could
lease
these
tidelands,
but
only
where
necessary
to
stop
drainage.
and
it
gave
them
authority
to
condemn
the
uplands
or
right
to
way
therein
or
to
lease
them
and
turn
them
over
to
the
state
lessee.
so
that
the
state
lessee
would
be
required
under
the
law
to
drill
offset
wells
and
thus
stop
that
drainage.
now,
that's
exactly
what
happened.
at
huntington
beach,
they
had
these
--
they've
had
wells
right
along
this
area
that
they're
involved
in
this
case.
there
were
11
shoreline
wells
and
--
and
they
were
draining
the
state's
reserves.
and
the
commission
evidently
thought
that
was
the
most
aggravated
case
in
the
state
and
i
believe
that
was
the
first
lease
to
be
granted.
and
there
were
no
filled
land
there,
although
later
on,
that
it
--
it
proved
that
the
state
could
have
authorized
the
lessee
to
make
an
island
and
drill
the
--
drill
the
uplands
from
the
island.
of
course,
if
they'd
done
that,
and
had
paid
nothing
to
the
upland
owners,
they
would
have
suffered
no
depletion.
the
--
the
property
could
have
been
completely
exhausted,
but
the
upland
owners
would
have
suffered
no
depletion
because
they
still
have
their
land,
they
still
have
their
own
oil
resources
under
their
own
land.
but
at
that
time,
the
commission
decided
that
it
would
use
the
uplands
to
militate
against
the
upland
owners
to
stop
the
drainage
that
they
were
carrying
on,
and
which
they
had
the
power
to
do.
but
the
commission
decided
that
they
wouldn't
initially
condemn
those
uplands,
that
they
would
give
the
upland
owners
a
--
a
right
to
make
a
law
and
jury
arrangement,
whether
it'd
be
better
for
the
state
lease.
but,
of
course,
if
the
upland
owners
had
been
obstructionists
or
had
demanded
an
excessive
rental,
so
that
no
one
would
bid
for
that
state
lease
with
the
state,
the
commission
would
not
allow
the
upland
owners
to
float
them
and
go
on
with
their
drainage
and
stop
the
operation
of
the
state
law,
they
would
have
condemned
the
upland
and
paid
the
upland
owners
a
specific
sum
of
money
for
their
land
or
specific
rental
for
the
use
of
their
land,
not
dependent
in
--
on
production
or
the
income
from
the
state
lease
and
the
upland
owners
lack
of
a
depletable
interest
would
have
been
entirely
clear.
or
the
state
could
under
those
circumstances
have
allowed
their
lessee
to
make
an
island
and
drill
and
exhaust
the
resources
from
that
island.
as
i
say,
the
--
the
lack
of
depletion
of
the
upland
owners
then
would
have
been
entirely
clear
again.
but
with
this
threat
of
condemnation
hanging
over
them,
the
upland
owners
were
willing
to
make
an
--
an
arrangement
with
the
southwest
production
company,
southwest
exploration
company
for
the
use
of
those
real
sites.
and
they
did
so.
and
southwest
received
the
lease
and
immediately
drilled
those
11
offset
wells,
that
they
were
required
to
do.
they
had
to
drill
every
one
of
them
even
though
every
one
of
them
had
been
dry.
so
the
state
became
the
dominant
party
under
that
lease,
not
the
subservient
party.
the
upland
owners
became
the
subservient
party
and
the
drainage
by
the
upland
owners
was
stopped.
now,
southwest
and
the
upland
owners
entered
into
three
contracts.
the
first
one,
although
it's
a
little
short
contract,
and
said
that
southwest
could
not
bottom
in
if
this
well's
under
the
uplands.
mr.
melvin
d.
wilson
no
--
no,
your
honor,
vertical
wells.
but
they
would
--
they
would
drain
quite
an
area
there.
that's
well
known
in
the
oil
fields
and
they're
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
case
law.
this
court
has
so
held
in
ohio
oil
company
versus
indiana.
and
was
--
that
was
the
rule
in
california.
oil
and
gas
travels
underground.
this
contract
provided
that
the
southwest
could
not
bottom
any
of
its
well
under
the
uplands.
therefore
couldn't
drain
any
of
the
upland
oil
resources.
the
arrangement
was
that
the
--
that
southwest
and
the
standard
oil
company,
the
lessee
of
the
uplands,
would
agree
on
the
operations
of
the
properties.
see
here,
but
two
oil
lessees
on
the
same
property.
here
with
the
--
the
uplander's
well
is
near
the
shore,
hence
southwest
came
back
farther
from
the
shore
and
had
to
go
right
through
and
under
those
wells
and
between
them.
and
they
used
the
same
surface
for
their
--for
their
derricks
and
their
power
units
and
their
pipes.
and
naturally,
there
had
to
be
some
regulation
for
the
joint
use
of
that
property.
and
--
and
under
that
regulation,
standard
oil
company
required
southwest
to
bottom
all
of
its
wells
at
least
200
feet
from
the
high
tide
line.
so,
southwest
was
not
draining
the
uplands
and
not
paying
any
rent
for
the
use
of
their
mineral
resources.
now,
the
--
the
most
important
contract,
i
think
that
the
parties
entered
into,
is
the
exhibit
9
(i)
found
and
on
page
59
of
our
record.
and
i
would
like
to
read
a
few
paragraphs
from
that
lease,
from
that
contract.
this
is
what
i
call
the
rental
contract
by
which
southwest
agreed
to
pay
a
rental
to
the
upland
owners
for
their
drilling
sites.
on
page
68
of
the
record,
southwest
agreed
to
pay
to
the
upland
owners
as
rental,
not
a
share
of
net
profits
but
an
amount
measured
by
a
share
in
net
profits.
and
on
page
69
in
paragraphs
9
and
10,
you
will
see
that
when
they
spoke
of
the
amounts
paid
to
the
upland
owners,
they
called
it
rental.
the
back
on
page
62,
where
the
party
spoke
of
the
amount
paid
to
the
state
of
california,
they
called
it
royalties.
paragraph
3
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
everytime
that
they
spoke
of
that
amount
paid
to
state
of
california
called
that
royalties.
every
time
they
spoke
of
the
amount
paid
to
the
upland
owners
they
called
it
rent.
now,
in
page
70
of
the
record,
if
the
court
please.
paragraph
13,
now
the
counsel
for
the
government
argues
that
in
effect,
the
upland
owners
were
co-lessors
with
the
state.
that
they
are
releasing
to
the
southwest,
something,
some
oil
reserves
they
claim
they
have
an
interest
in
the
oil
reserves,
so
they
claimed
they're
co-lessors
with
the
state.
but
listen
what
they
agreed
to.
paragraph
13,
"it
is
understood
and
agreed
that
nothing
herein,
that
is
the
use
of
the
uplands
and
the
payment
of
rental,
shall
add
to
the
rights
given
to
southwest
under
such
state
easement."
in
other
words,
the
exclusive
right
and
to
drill
and
extract,
that
the
upland
owners
right,
there's
nothing
to
that.
that
same
paragraph
says
that
if
--
if
southwest
doesn't
pay
the
rent,
the
upland
owners
can't
cancel
the
contract.
paragraph
14
on
page
70
says
that
if
that
where--
whereas
this
rental
is
--
is
an
amount
measured
by
net
profits,
but
still
if
in
the
overall
operation
of
that
lease,
southwest
has
a
loss,
operates
that
lease
in
an
overall
loss,
that
it
cannot
get
back
these
rentals
that
it
paid
year
by
year
out
of
these
apparent
net
profits.
so,
that
that
rental
would
be
paid
out
of
--
through
southwest
capital.
and
therefore
it
was
a
personal
covenant.
on
page
72
of
the
transcript,
in
this
same
contract,
paragraph
19,
it
says
that
this
--
this
agreement
to
pay
a
rental
to
the
upland
owners
shall
not
be
construed
to
give
the
upland
owners
any
right,
title
or
interest
into
said
state
plants
or
under
said
state
easement.
and
it
also
says
that
the
southwest
can
modify
or
cancel
and
terminate
the
state
easement
without
the
consent
of
the
upland
owners.
page
73
of
the
contract,
of
the
record
of
paragraph
23,
it
says
that
the
parties
shall
not
be
considered
partners
in
the
operations
of
the
state
lease.
now,
the
--
the
upland
owners,
of
course,
they're
already
getting
a
one
depletion
deduction
for
their
property.
they've
--
they've
leased
their
property
years
ago
to
standard
oil
company.
they're
getting
royalties
and
getting
depletion
deductions
on
it,
for
their
natural
resources.
now,
they
want
to
get
a
--
a
depletion
deduction
for
use
of
their
surface
and
the
dirt
of
their
land,
a
non-mineral
property.
but
the
holding
by
this
court
said
the
upland
owners
have
an
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place,
an
economic
interest
in
this
mineral
in
place
would
violate
these
five
propositions.
it
violates
the
agreement
of
the
parties
that
they
had
no
interest
in
the
lease
of
the
mineral
with
deposit.
it
would
violate
the
lease,
the
state
lease
which
says
that
southwest
cannot
assign
an
interest
in
the
lease
without
the
written
consent
of
the
commission
and
that
no
such
consent
was
requested
or
obtained.
it
would
violate
the
state
lands
act
which
says
that
the
state
cannot
sell
its
mineral
resources
and
can
only
rent
them
on
a
royalty
basis
and
that
upland
owners
pay
no
royalty
to
the
-
to
the
state
of
california
in
connection
with
this
lease.
it
would
violate
the
constitution
of
california
which
says
that
--
that
no
--
no
state
official
can
give
anything
to
anyone.
now,
here
these
folks
claim
that
they're
co-lessors
with
the
state.
they
didn't
have
anything
to
begin
with
and
they
claim
now
that
they
are
co-lessors
with
the
state
and
they're
giving
us
rights
to
extract
the
oil.
but
that
that
would
mean
they
must
had
had
a
gift
from
california
which
would
violate
the
constitution.
and
then
the
fifth
violation
of
this
would
constitute
--
would
be
a
violation
of
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
state
law,
the
purpose
of
which,
was
to
stop
the
upland
owners
from
--
from
continuing
their
drainage.
and
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
think
that
that
law
with
that
purpose
would
vest
any
rights
in
them
or
give
them
greater
rights
than
they
already
have.
the
reasonable
interpretation
is
that
it
cuts
off
the
rights
that
their
state
was
aiming
at.
so,
the
upland
owners
are
not
renting
to
southwest
any
mineral
property.
they're
simply
renting
a
facility,
a
non-mineral
property,
something
that
we
didn't
really
physically
need
except
for
the
state
law.
we
didn't
need
it
at
all.
we
could
have
drilled
from
barges
or
structures.
that
all
they
have
then,
is
a
mere
right
to
receive
a
sum
of
money.
it
happens
to
be
measured
by
a
share
of
net
profits
from
the
lease.
they
have
no
economic
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place.
they
only
have
a
personal
covenant.
and
this
court
has
held
in
the
cases
mentioned
by
counsel
that
a
--
a
mere
right
to
net
profits
by
a
stranger
to
a
lease,
one
who
has
no
--
no
economic
interest
in
it
is
not
depletable.
now,
counsel
has
not,
in
his
argument
or
in
the
brief
mentioned
the
regulations.
now,
the
regulations
are
absolutely,
expressly
in
point
on
the
subject
and
--
and
decide
the
matter,
we
think,
in
our
favor
of
regulations.
mr.
melvin
d.
wilson
thank
you.
all
right,
sir.
mr.
melvin
d.
wilson
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court,
just
to
review
briefly
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
upland
owners
have
depletable
interest
and
economic
interest
in
the
mineral
resources
under
the
tidelands
adjoining
their
uplands.
they've
claimed
they
do,
does
they
receive
rent
for
the
--
the
drill
sites
on
their
uplands
and
they
also
claim
that
under
the
state
law
that
the
effect
of
the
state
law
was
to
terminate
the
drainage
from
the
state
tideland
that
was
taking
place
from
the
uplanders
vertical
wells.
the
state
obtained
the
use
of
the
uplands
as
drill
sites
through
respondent
and
under
threat
of
condemnation
to
accomplish
that
purpose
and
in
the
manner
that
would
not
despoil
the
beaches.
but
the
state,
of
course,
could
not
prevent
the
upland
owners
from
receiving
rent
for
the
use
of
their
property,
but
this
was
ordinary
rent
for
the
use
of
inexhaustible
land
not
a
royalty
for
the
consumption
of
a
mineral
resource.
southwest
was
not
consuming
the
mineral
resource
under
the
uplanders
land.
they
were
running
that,
just
leasing
that
to
standard
oil
company.
and
before
this
situation
started,
they
had
no
interest
in
the
state's
mineral
resource
under
the
tidelands
and
they
have
agreed
that
none
of
these
arrangements
gave
them
an
interest
in
the
state
lease
or
the
state
tidelands.
simply
that
their
rent
is
commensurate
with
usefulness
of
the
land
but
that
is
customary.
many
storeowners
who
rent
their
stores
are
based
on
a
percentage
of
sales
of
their
tenant.
they
simply
had
an
economic
advantage
derived
from
production
and
they
are
strangers
to
the
state's
mineral
reserves.
now,
the
regulations
and
the
cases
of
this
court
are
very
clearly
defined
depletable
interest
and
i
would
like
to
read
the
regulation
found
in
our
respondent's
brief
on
pages
1
and
2.
it
will
take
just
a
moment
and
it's
--
i
think
right
in
point.
the
case
starting
on
page
1,
it
says
that
section
23
(m)
provides
that
they
should
be
allowed
as
deduction
in
computing
net
income
in
the
case
of
oil
and
gas
wells,
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depletion.
under
such
provisions,
the
owner
of
an
economic
interest
in
mineral
deposits
is
allowed
annual
depletion
deductions.
an
economic
interest
is
possessed
in
every
case
in
which
the
taxpayer
has
required
by
investment
any
interest
in
mineral
in
place
and
secured
by
any
form
of
legal
relationship,
income
derived
from
the
severance
and
sale
of
the
mineral
to
which
he
must
look
for
a
return
of
his
capitals
or
rather
the
affirmative
portions
of
the
regulation.
i
think
the
next
two
sentences
cover
the
upland
owner
situation.
but
a
person
who
has
no
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
deposit
does
not
possess
an
economic
interest
merely
because
through
a
contractual
relation
to
the
owner,
he
possesses
a
mere
economic
advantage
derived
from
production.
thus,
an
agreement
between
the
owner
of
an
economic
interest
and
another
entitling
the
latter
to
purchase
the
product
upon
deduction
or
to
sharing
the
net
income
derived
from
the
interest
of
such
owner
does
not
convey
a
depletable
economic
interest.
and
we
believe
that
that
regulation
is
--
is
clear
and
expressly
covered
this
situation.
it
shows
that
southwest
has
a
depletable
interest
and
the
upland
owners
do
not
have.
now,
that
regulation
was
written
in
1939
and
embodies
five
decisions
of
this
court,
defining
depletable
interest.
the
first
two,
lynch
versus
alworth-stephens
company
and
palmer
versus
bender
fixed,
defined
depletable
interest
and
the
next
three
decided
this
for
a
few
months
before
this
regulation
was
promulgated,
limited
depletion
deductions.
those
cases
were
the
bankline
oil
company,
the
o'donnell
and
the
elbe
case.
by
the
time,
i
could
--
i
could
point
out
just
practically
as
if
the
names
of
those
cases
were
in
this
regulation
just
exactly
the
paragraphs
and
the
sentences
that
--
that
they
--
that
are
covered.
now,
that
regulation
has
been
before
this
court
three
times
and
three
depletion
cases
since
that
regulation
was
written.
in
the
anderson
versus
helvering,
kirby
petroleum
and
burton-sutton
and
this
court
has
never
criticized
that
regulation
nor
criticized
nor
overruled
any
of
the
cases
upon
which
it
was
based.
congress
in
the
17
years,
this
regulation
has
been
on
the
books
has
not
seen
and
found
it
necessary
to
clarify
the
regulation.
we
think
it
establishes
the
depletion
theory
that
a
person
must
have
the
right
to
go
upon
the
property,
drill
and
extract
the
mineral
resource
and
receive
some
income
therefrom
and
to
have
retained
some
interest
therein,
either
a
partnership
interest
or
a
tenants
in
common
or
a
right
of
reversion
or
a
contingent
right
of
reversions
not
have
counter
disposed
of
their
interest.
we
didn't
think
the
regulation
not
only
is
clear
but
that
it's
valid.
of
course,
it
conforms
to
the
five
decisions
of
this
court
upon
which
it
was
based.
it's
not
been
criticized
in
the
three
subsequent
decisions.
congress
has
deemed
to
have
approved
it
and
they
have
amended
the
revenue
code
nine
times
since
that
regulation
was
promulgated
and
have
never
amended
the
section
relating
to
depletion
of
oil
and
gas
wells.
they
are
presumed
to
have
noticed
that
the
regulation
conforms
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
so
this
regulation
is
thrice
--
thrice
fortified
based
on
an
interpretation
of
the
judicial
department
promulgated
by
the
legislative
department
and
approved
by
--
by
the
executive
department,
approved
by
the
legislative
department.
we
believe
that
it
has
a
force
and
effect
of
law
and
is
embedded
in
the
law
and
fully
as
if
it
where
in
the
statute
itself
and,
of
course,
this
court
does
not
strike
down
the
valid
law.
now,
the
government
and
the
upland
owners
are
asking
really
for
two
depletion
deductions
on
their
land
or
based
on
their
land,
one,
for
their
mineral
resource
to
which
is
being
consumed
by
their
lessees,
the
standard
oil
company,
of
course,
which
is
no
--
no
question
and
then
another
depletion
deduction
based
on
the
use
of
their
--
their
lands,
their
inexhaustible
asset,
a
non-mineral
property.
they
would
deny
to
--
to
southwest
depletion,
deduction
on
a
portion
of
the
gross
income
from
the
state
lease,
its
mineral
property.
but
if
southwest
that
has
assumed
all
the
risks
of
drilling
these
wells
and
incurred
all
the
expense
of
drilling
and
operating
the
wells
and
we
believe
that
southwest
is
entitled
to
the
encouragement
intended
by
congress
for
those
who
explore
and
produce
natural
resources.
