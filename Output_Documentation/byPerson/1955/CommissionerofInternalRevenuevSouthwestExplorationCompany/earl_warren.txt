chief

suppose
mr.
horrow,
in
order
to
make
this
oil
merchantable
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
pipeline
from
the
well
and,
let's
say,
three
or
four
miles
in
place
it
was
convenient
for
--
for
handling
the
oil
and
southwest
acquired
an
easement
over
--
over
the
land
for
that
pipeline
and
paid
for
it
by
a
percentage
of
the
--
of
the
net
profits.
would
the
owners
of
that
land
have
a
depletion
allowance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

have
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
see
how
--
how
these
things
apply
because
it
--
its
just
by
position
of
your
land
that
--
with
relation
to
the
state
pool
that
you
claim
to
be
entitled
to
this
depletion
allowance.now
--
and
we
could
also
say
that
it's
because
of
the
relationship
of
this
--
of
this
land
that
you
get
an
easement
over
is
in
the
similar
relation
to
your
land
that
is
necessary
for
you
to
--
necessary
for
them
to
have
that
in
order
to
produce.
now,
why
wouldn't
that
produce
the
same
effect
so
far
as
depletion
is
concerned?
