mr.
nathan
baker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
brought
under
the
jones
act
that
recovered
damages
for
the
death
of
a
fireman
employed
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
by
reason
of
the
negligence
of
this
defendant
railroad.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
before
the
trial
judge
and
the
jury,
the
trial
judge
directed
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
defendant
and
took
the
case
away
from
the
jury.
the
trial
judge
in
his
opinion
conceded
there
was
some
evidence
of
negligence.
it
was
also
conceded
by
the
trial
judge
because
of
the
concession
by
the
defense
during
the
course
of
the
trial
that
there
was
an
accidental
death.
but
the
trial
judge
felt
that
there
was
no
causal
relation
between
the
negligence
and
the
accidental
death.
there
was
mere
speculation
and
refused
to
have
the
jury
hear
it
and
make
the
decision.
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
was
affirmed
on
the
same
question
of
proximate
cause.
the
major
question
involved
on
this
appeal
is
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
facts
presented
from
which
inferences
can
be
drawn
by
a
jury
to
show
causal
relation
between
the
negligence
and
the
accidental
death
of
this
deceased.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
interesting.
there
were
no
eyewitnesses
to
this
accident,
but
there
are
certain
facts,
physical
facts
which
were
proven
which
i
will
soon
show
--
show
to
the
court,
which
physical
facts
are
direct
evidence
and
most
of
the
facts
to
which
i
will
now
allude
are
uncontradicted.
first,
and
it's
not
in
the
order
of
importance,
it's
just
sending
forth
these
facts
and
then
i'll
attempt
to
correlate
them.
the
deceased
was
found
drowned
wearing
only
an
underwear
and
with
his
shoes.
next,
we
have
the
--
and
shoes,
just
underwear
and
his
shoes.
next,
have
the
fact
that
he
was
found
with
a
searchlight
in
one
of
his
hands.
we
next
have
the
fact
that
this
man,
who
was
i
fireman
on
this
tug,
an
employee
of
the
defendant
railroad,
that
his
clothes,
his
street
clothes
were
found
in
the
first
tug
and
he
was
assigned
to
watch
four
tugs
and
the
first
tug
was
the
altoona,
docked
against
the
pier.
and
in
the
ordinary
usual
place
where
he
undresses
and
changes
his
clothes,
they
found
his
street
clothes
there
with
the
exception
of
his
shoes.
next,
we
have
the
fact,
the
physical
uncontradicted
fact
that
in
the
same
location,
in
the
engine
room
where
he
had
his
street
clothes
in
a
bag,
was
found
his
working
clothes
and
a
little
lunch
basket
all
untouched.
we
have
the
next
physical
fact
that
the
last
time
he
was
seen
alive
was
seven
o'clock
at
night
when
he
was
walking
up
the
dock
towards
the
altoona,
the
vessel
which
was
docked
alongside
of
the
pier.
that
was
the
time
he
was
seen
alive,
walking
towards
this
vessel.
all
of
these
facts
so
far
are
undisputed.
we
have
additional
fact
that
his
duty
was
to
take
care
of
the
fires
and
keep
the
steam
up
in
the
boilers.
i
think
this
was
the
christmas
eve
and
they
were
to
keep
him
going
until
the
--
over
christmas
until
the
following
day
and
it's
undisputed
that
with
the
following
day
that
these
tugs
continued
in
the
normal
course
of
operation
and
his
job
was
to
keep
those
fires
up,
up
to
the
time
when
his
job
was
to
be
complete
that
night
and
he
was
to
go
off
duty
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning.
at
11
o'clock
that
night
and
just
to
correlate
the
time,
at
seven
o'clock,
he
was
seen
walking
towards
the
altoona.
at
11
o'clock,
another
fireman
who
was
to
relieve
him
on
that
particular
vessel
noticed
the
fires
had
not
been
attended
to
for
about
three
hours,
that
would
bring
back
the
time
when
he
was
apparently
missing
to
about
eight
o'clock
or
an
hour
after
he
was
last
seen
walking
towards
this
vessel.
and
the
same
fireman
who
relieved
him
or
was
supposed
to
relieve
him
on
this
vessel,
found
an
injector
was
on.
mr.
nathan
baker
injector
was
on
the
last
vessel,
the
fourth
vessel,
which
was
named
williamsport.
what
is
the
injector?
they
inject
in
the
cons
would
be
undisputed
evidence
was
apparatus
operated
manually
for
the
purpose
of
putting
water
into
the
boiler
when
it
needed
water
and
that
when
the
boiler
would
be
dry
and
needed
water
that
will
be
some
sort
of
a
whistling,
sizzling
sound
which
could
be
heard
for
half-mile
around.
now,
this
injector
was
on
at
11
o'clock
that
night.
it's
operated
manually
to
put
it
on
or
take
it
off.
the
man
who,
last,
was
on
that
vessel
before
the
deceased
shows
was
a
man
by
name
of
barker
and
he
testified
all
in
the
plaintiff's
case
that
he
shut
off
all
the
injectors
about
five
o'clock
that
evening.
so
that
the
necessary
inferences
that
there
was
no
one
that
had
put
that
injector
on
except
schulz
who
was
the
only
person
who
followed
barker
upon
this
vessel.
that
too,
i
submit
to
your
honors
are
undisputed.
mr.
nathan
baker
the
injector
was
on
the
fourth
vessel
out.
mr.
nathan
baker
in
the
engine
room,
in
the
boiler
room,
that's
the
williamsport.
the
defense
admitted
that
there's
no
foul
play.
they
admitted
in
the
record
there
was
no
suicide.
they
admitted
that
the
man
was
sober.
they
admitted
his
not
old
man
and
in
all
--
other
words,
they
admitted
an
accidental
death,
but,
of
course,
denied
any
causal
relation.
there
are
other
facts
concerning
the
conditions
that
existed
that
night.
some
of
these
are
disputed
to
some
extent
mainly
to
proof
that
the
plaintiff
provides
that
there
were
no
rights
on
the
--
on
--
on
these
tugs
that
it
was
dark
from
the
outboard
side
of
the
altoona,
the
first
one
next
to
the
pier,
to
the
fourth
tug
out
the
williamsport.
three
or
four
or
more
of
the
witnesses
testify
to
this
darkness
condition.
it
was
undisputed
that
none
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
in
going
from
tug
to
tug
they
have
to
use
flashlights.
there
was
also
proof
in
the
case
that
the
deceased
was
assigned
to
four
tugs
that
night
and
that
this
is
not
--
time
was
actually
not
capable
of
taking
care
more
of
two
tugs
at
a
time.
the
evidence
indicates
that
when
he
was
relieved,
he
was
relieved
by
man
who
took
care
of
two
tugs
instead
of
the
four
tugs
which
he
had.
with
these
facts,
the
fact
that
an
accident
is
admitted,
admitted,
a
fact
that
there
was
proof
of
negligence,
some
of
which
may
have
been
disputed.
it
is
submitted
to
your
honors
that
there
were
sufficient
facts
for
which
a
reasonable
inference
could
be
drawn
by
a
jury
that
the
accidental
death
of
the
deceased
was
due
to
the
negligence
of
this
defendant.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
case
is
quite
similar
to
the
sadler
case
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
also
quite
similar
where
a
man
was
drowned
between
several
tugs.
thereto,
the
man
that
it
--
thereto,
it
was
necessary
for
the
person
to
use
flashlights
to
get
around
the
tugs.
there,
too,
the
darkness
was
the
cause
of
the
--
of
the
injury
or
death
of
this
man
and
the
court
there
held,
and
i've
cited
it
on
page
16
of
my
brief
and
was
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
and
without
reading
the
law,
the
court
there
held
that
while
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
certainty
what
cause
decedent
to
fall
between
the
barges,
it
is
a
reasonable
inference
from
the
evidence
that
in
attempting
to
go
from
one
to
the
other,
he
fell
between
them
as
result
of
the
defective
lighting.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
reasonable
inferences
indicate
the
time
when
this
accident
happened.
from
all
of
these
facts,
the
jury
could
have
very
easily
found
the
time
to
be
between
seven
and
i
said
10
o'clock
in
my
brief,
i
think
i
can
bring
it
down
closest,
seven
to
eight
that
night
because
it
was
11,
they
found
it
was
neglected
about
three
hours
and
brought
it
down
for
about
eight
o'clock.
so
between
seven
and
eight
o'clock,
his
death
took
place.
mr.
nathan
baker
they
found
the
fires
that
he
was
supposed
to
attend
on
these
tugs
below
and
neglected
indicating
that
there
were
neglected
for
a
period
of
about
three
hours.
so
that
he
was
missing
during
those
three
hours
apparently
from
those
facts.
now,
the
place,
where
could
the
jury
reasonably
find
a
place
where
this
man
was
injured.
he
certainly
wasn't
running
around
the
docks
in
his
underwear
and
his
shoes.
he
was
on
the
vessel,
the
first
vessel,
the
altoona.
his
clothes
were
there.
he
was
changing
his
clothes.
that
isn't
the
question
of
inferences.
i
think
it's
direct
testimony.
he
had
taken
off
his
work
--
regular
clothes
and
they
were
hanging
there
in
the
first
tug
against
the
pier.
his
work
clothes,
he
still
didn't
put
him
on.
and
during
the
course
of
changing
his
clothes,
he
was
compelled
to
take
a
search
light
in
his
hand
and
do
something,
to
do
something
in
the
requirement
from
the
course
of
his
work.
and
what
happened
--
mr.
nathan
baker
the
weather
was
very
cold,
freezing
--
mr.
nathan
baker
very
cold.
it
was
some
ice
around
different
locations
of
the
various
part
of
the
barge.
that's
an
evidence
also
with
a
temperature
chart,
weather
charts.
so
what
is
the
reasonable
inference
that
the
jury
can
draw
up
in
those
interesting
facts?
the
fourth
vessel
out,
the
williamsport,
had
the
injector
on.
and
i
submit
it
to
your
honors
that
a
reasonable
inference
can
be
drawn
from
those
facts
by
a
jury
in
an
emergency
roles
which
compelled
him
to
the
course
to
change
his
clothes
to
go
to
the
fourth
vessel
across
the
other
two
intermediate
vessels,
get
to
the
fourth
vessel
out,
the
williamsport,
put
on
the
injector
in
order
to
put
water
into
the
boiler
and
on
his
way
back
in
causing
--
from
tug
to
tug,
something
happened
so
as
to
cause
him
to
fall
in
between
the
barges
and
drowned.
mr.
nathan
baker
there
was
no
question.
mr.
nathan
baker
as
i
understand
it,
he
then
puts
the
water
up
to
proper
level.
mr.
nathan
baker
and
then
everything
is
all
right.
then,
you
have
to
take
it
off
again
manually.
it's
all
manually.
mr.
nathan
baker
it
was
taken
off.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i'm
very
frank
to
say,
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is.
i
know
that
it
has
to
be
taken
off
manually
and
usually
taken
off
either
a
few
minutes
or
an
hour,
whatever
it
is,
but
it
have
to
be
taken
off
also
manually.
this
was
not
taken
off
manually.
mr.
nathan
baker
no,
no,
it's
just
they
--
like
a
button
or
a
lever
that
you
press
it,
you
press
the
lever
and
then
up
goes
the
water
and
you
leave
it
alone.
mr.
nathan
baker
each
boiler
has
an
injector
and
there's
one
boiler
on
each
tug.
and
then
when
the
--
you'd
have
to
take
the
injector
off
manually,
too.
that
is
in
the
evidence.
mr.
nathan
baker
(inaudible)
mr.
nathan
baker
no,
no,
it's
put
on
and
left
on.
that's
in
the
evidence
and
then
just
let
alone.
it
stays
in
the
--
how
much
water
it
needs
and
then
the
person
who
find
is
suppose
to
go
back
and
then
take
it
off.
this
was
not
taken
off.
mr.
nathan
baker
water.
mr.
nathan
baker
no.
mr.
nathan
baker
no,
when
the
--
when
there's
a
need
of
water
so
as
to
require
an
injector
to
put
on,
the
steam
starts
in
sizzling
or
making
sizzling
sound
and
according
to
one
of
the
witnesses,
he
says
you
can
hear
it
half-mile
away.
mr.
nathan
baker
that's
one
of
the
reasonable
inferences
that
a
jury
can
draw
from
those
circumstances.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
all
of
these
facts
including
the
fact
that
he
did
have
the
flashlight
in
his
hand,
he
was
found
drowned
with
the
flashlight
in
his
hand.
its
indication
that
he
was
doing
his
work,
as
i
say,
he
was
passing
from
tug
to
tug
and
the
jury
can
reasonably
find
that.
it
also
indicates,
i
submit,
that
at
the
point
where
he
was
doing
his
work
at
the
time
when
he
was
drowned,
it
was
dark
and
that's
why
he
was
using
a
flashlight.
mr.
nathan
baker
negligence
is
the
fact
that
there
was
no
light
and
that
there
was
darkness
in
that
vicinity
of
the
barges.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
might.
no
light
in
the
barge.
there's
no
question
that
there
is
no
light
in
the
barge.
they
all
agree
that
there
was
no
light.
there
were
some
testimony
submitted
by
the
defense
that
there
was
some
sort
of
a
light
from
the
dock
which
might
put
some
light
in
the
vicinity
of
the
barges.
that
was
disputed
by
the
plaintiff's
evidence
which
indicated
it
was
completely
dark
on
the
out
port
side
of
the
--
of
the
altoona
and
the
other
three
vessels
were
completely
dark,
in
complete
darkness
and
that
they
were
getting
about
with
the
use
of
this
flashlight.
mr.
nathan
baker
no,
no
evidence
was
submitted
about
that.
there
was
--
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
lurching
or
improper
luring.
there
was
no
evidence
to
that.
there
was
this
evidence
of
the
darkness.
there
was
evidence
as
i
had
pointed
out
that
the
--
they
usually
would
used
a
man
for
two
tugs
and
--
and
here
they
used
the
man
for
four
tugs
because
of
the
fact
that
--
i
supposed
of
the
shortage
to
help
christmas
eve
or
something
like
and
which
we
also
claim
as
one
of
the
other
evidence
of
negligence.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
these
facts
raised
reasonable
inferences
for
the
jury
from
which
they
could
draw
the
reasonable
inference
that
there
was
a
causal
relation
between
the
negligence,
which
i
have
outlined
here,
and
the
accidental
death.
mr.
nathan
baker
according
to
the
evidence,
there
was
complete
darkness.
mr.
nathan
baker
no,
there
were
lights
on
the
dock.there
was
evidence
of
certain
--
mr.
nathan
baker
--
flashlight
or
searchlight.
mr.
nathan
baker
no,
the
evidence
was,
your
honor
--
mr.
nathan
baker
it
was
completely
dark.
every
tug
was
completely
dark,
no
lights
whatsoever.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honors
--
yes,
were
different.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
submit
to
your
honor
also
that
this
case
comes
within
the
lavender
versus
kurn
case
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
that
where
the
evidence
is
such
that
a
jury
may
draw
different
inferences.
the
jury
could
choose
what
seems
to
them
the
most
reasonable
inference,
it's
my
paraphrasing
of
the
--
of
the
language
in
that
case.
i
submit
to
your
honor
also
that
the
most
logical
inference
that
the
deceased
is
--
is
that
the
deceased
fell
into
the
water
while
crossing
from
the
tug
to
tug
in
the
darkness.
there's
also
evidence
here
of
icy
conditions.
mr.
nathan
baker
yes.
mr.
nathan
baker
that
he
was
crossing
from
tug
to
tug
and
the
fact
that
his
clothes
where
he
changed
was
on
the
first
tug.
he
had
changed
his
clothes.
and
then
complete
change
--
he
start
to
change
clothes
and
he
was
still
in
his
underwear.
he
had
a
searchlight
in
his
hand.
he
had
his
shoes
on.
the
injector
on
the
fourth
vessel
out
was
on.
the
only
person
who
could
put
it
on
was
the
deceased
on
the
unquestioned
evidence.
and
therefore,
the
reasonable
inference
is
that
he
went
from
the
first
tug
to
the
fourth
tug,
put
on
the
injector
and
on
the
way
back,
he
fell
between
the
tugs
in
darkness
while
he
have
this
searchlight
in
his
hand.
mr.
nathan
baker
in
his
hand.
and
he
was
found
drowned
and
dead
with
the
searchlight
clogged
in
his
hand
and
that's
undisputed
by
the
police
evidence
here.
quite
an
interesting
--
quite
interesting
fact.
mr.
nathan
baker
oh,
yes.
mr.
nathan
baker
oh,
yes,
that
was
his
job.
mr.
nathan
baker
that
was
part
of
his
job.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
court
below
recognized
the
fact
that
there
was
evidence
of
negligence
and
improperly
directed
the
verdict
and
that
it
should
been
submitted
to
the
jury
from
these
facts
to
determine
all
of
these
factual
questions.
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
also
other
cases
which
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
discuss
at
this
time.
now,
i
have
another
point,
a
--
a
second
point
and
that
point
was
not
dealt
upon
--
dealt
with
by
the
trial
judge
nor
by
the
appellate
judge
of
the
second
circuit,
whether
or
not
the
deceased
was
a
seaman
or
a
member
of
the
crew.
and
i
feel
that
perhaps
i
ought
to
at
least
refer
to
it
because
after
all
in
order
for
this
man
to
sue
under
the
jones
act,
he
must
be
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
and
very
briefly,
i'll
do
it,
is
that
mr.
schulz
was
an
extra
fireman,
dispatched
to
different
tugs
each
day,
that
this
particular
tug
that
day
was
dark
and
his
job
was
known
as
a
watch
fireman
for
that
day.
mr.
nathan
baker
no
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
see,
what
he
is,
is
on
a
--
he
has
what
is
known
as
an
extra
fireman.
he
gets
on
a
--
a
list,
in
a
seniority
list
and
they
take
that
list
and
one
day
he
goes
on
a
ship
that
--
a
tugboat
as
a
fireman
which
is
docked.
the
next
day,
it's
a
running
tug
that
goes
out
for
three
to
four
days.
the
next
day
it's
a
boat
that
goes
off
for
24
hours.
they
have
different
names.
this
day,
he
was
selected
to
be
a
watch
fireman
on
the
tug
which
is
standing
still
in
dock
overnight.
now
--
mr.
nathan
baker
yes.
mr.
nathan
baker
yes,
this
was
the
first
day,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
baker
now,
the
evidence
indicate
that
the
duties
which
he
had
to
tend
to
fire,
to
keep
the
steam
up,
was
the
same
duty
as
this
fireman
when
he's
on
a
running
tug.
there's
no
difference,
the
same
requirement,
the
same
qualifications.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
--
that
this
case
presents
a
question
of
fact
at
least
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
he's
a
seaman
or
member
of
the
crew
and
in
view
of
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
including
the
(inaudible)
case
that
the
question
of
fact,
the
triers
of
the
fact
and
those
number
of
decisions
that
i
quote
in
my
brief
on
that
point
and
--
and
it's
a
question
for
the
triers
of
the
fact
and
it
should
have
been
submitted
to
jury
to
term
that
point.
there's
a
recent
decision
of
this
court,
(inaudible)
against
texas,
cited
in
my
brief,
november
07,
1955
where
the
circuit
court
decided
the
question
of
law,
this
question,
the
similar
question
and
this
court,
the
supreme
court
reversed
and
decided
that
the
lower
court
was
right
in
treating
of
the
question
of
facts.
the
(inaudible)
case
cited
in
my
brief
shows
that
although
vessel
is
dark,
it's
considered
navigation.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
this
man
was
a
fireman,
definitely
was
an
aid
of
navigation,
he's
not
a
longshoreman.
the
history
of
the
legislation
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
act
shows
that
it's
longshoreman
and
repair
workers
that
are
considered
a
shore
workers,
but
it
considered
is
not
--
is
not
members
of
the
crew,
but
this
man
was
neither
that
he
was
an
assistant
of
long
shore
work,
he
wasn't
repairing
the
vessel.
he
was
actually
doing
a
--
a
crew
member's
job.
actually,
the
same
as
any
other
crew
members
of
fireman
definitely.
i
submit
your
honor
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
and
the
fact
that
the
railroad
saw
fit
that
particular
day
to
give
him
more
than
one
vessel.
i
submit
to
your
honor,
it
does
not
deprive
him
the
status
of
being
the
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
nathan
baker
may
i
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i'll
try
to
be
very
brief
in
my
reply.
first,
chief
justice
warren,
you
asked
a
question
about
the
temperature.
there
is
direct
evidence
from
stetson,
the
assistant
foreman
in
page
24
of
the
record
that
at
the
time
of
this
evening,
the
temperature
was
10
above
zero.
that
was
his
testimony,
the
assistant
foreman.
that's
outside
of
the
weather
reports.
i
submit
also
that
the
reference
to
the
darkness
at
least
counsel's
argument
has
indicated
a
question
of
fact
and
in
the
question
of
darkness
as
direct
evidence
in
addition
to
the
fireman
who
took
the
place
of
this
deceased
from
mr.
kaufman,
a
crew
dispatcher,
called
the
crew
dispatcher.
on
page
14
of
the
record,
he
says
there
were
no
lights
on
the
boat
and
that
was
it
was
so
dark
in
a
boat
that
he
had
to
use
flashlight
and
a
mr.
stetson,
the
assistant
foreman
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad
on
page
21
of
the
record
says
that
he
used
the
railroad
light,
the
large
railroad
light
in
getting
about
from
boat
to
boat
under
those
circumstances.
at
least
it
raised
a
--
a
disputed
question
of
facts
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
on
the
question
of
johnson
versus
palmer
upon
which
the
circuit
court
rested
its
opinion,
i
think
that
can
be
distinguished
in
the
present
case
because
in
the
johnson
case,
there
was
just
the
question
of
the
one
point
of
negligence,
the
absence
of
the
giving
of
a
signal
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
he
met
his
death
at
that
time.
but
here,
we
have
darkness
proven
to
be
a
continuing
act
at
all
times
while
he
was
on
that
vessel,
so
that
it's
entirely
different
so
that
while
that
darkness
was
present
as
a
continuing
act,
the
indication
is
that
it
was
that
negligence
that
the
jury
can
raise
a
necessary
inference
that
the
negligence
was
during
the
period
of
time
when
that
darkness
prevailed
when
he
met
his
accidental
dead.
i
think
it
can
be
distinguished
from
that
way.
i
like
to
state
to
the
court
that
the
two
exhibits
mainly
the
exhibit
p11
in
our
brief,
i
set
it
forth
as
the
exhibit
p1,
it
should
be
p11
and
by
error,
we
have
not
left
it
with
the
clerk,
so
it
was
not
made
part
of
record.
the
main
purpose
of
that
exhibit
shows
that
in
that
exhibit,
the
police
record
shows
that
when
he
was
found
and
taken
out
of
the
water,
he
had
a
flashlight
in
his
hand,
when
taken
out
of
the
water
only
underwear
and
shoes
are
on,
as
i've
been
arguing
throughout
this
appeal
and
i
see
also
a
photograph
here,
exhibit
c,d.
i
was
wondering
if
i
can
ask
the
admission
of
the
court
to
leave
it
with
the
clerk
so
it
would
be
included
in
the
original
record.
mr.
nathan
baker
and
i'd
be
very
happy
to
make
a
--
part
of
the
printed
of
record
if
he
shows
--
so
desired.
mr.
nathan
baker
thank
you.
mr.
nathan
baker
they
are
exhibits.
mr.
nathan
baker
i'll
leave
it
with
the
clerk.
thank
you.
