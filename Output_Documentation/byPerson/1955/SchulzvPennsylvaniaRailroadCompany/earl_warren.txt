railroad.
mr.
baker,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
when
this
injector
needed
some
kind
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
treatment
that
--
that
there
was
an
alarm
sounded
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
be
heard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
had
he
been
on
that
ship?
was
this
his
first
day
or?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
he
been
out
there
some
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
was
the
first
day
that
he'd
--
he'd
this
combination
of
four
--
four
tugs
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
these
--
these
tugs
were
on
this
night.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
allen,
if
--
if
that
noise
had
sounded,
might
it
be
an
indication
that
the
--
the
watchman
was
not
attending
to
his
duties
properly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
therefore,
he
might
have
hurried
to
that
---
that
boat
to
take
care
of
the
emergency
before
the
--
the
alarm
did
sound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
portions
of
all
the
boats?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
--
how
far
would
the
nearest
light
be
to
the
last
tug?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
there
was
any
--
if
there
was
any
ice
in
regardless
of
where
it
--
it
was,
i
suppose
that
would
be
some
evidence
as
to
whether
it
was
negligence
to
leave
the
tugs
unlighted,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
your
--
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
282,
alma
schulz,
administratrix
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
mr.
allen,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
--
wasn't
the
temperature
40
degrees
some
hours
before
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
it
--
did
the
record
show
that
it
steadily
increased
throughout
the
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
that
it
was
just
50
degrees
the
next
day.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
normally
any
difference
in
temperatures
on
one
side
of
that
river
and
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
judge
did
find
that
there
was
negligence,
didn't
he?
but
merely
didn't
find
that
there's
any
causal
connection
between
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
negligence
and
the
death.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
there
was
some
mark
to
identify
where
he
had
fallen,
would
there
be
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
only
weakness
in
this
case
as
you
see
it,
the
only
fatal
weakness
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
where
--
where
he
went
into
the
water.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
baker.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
may
be
left
to
the
clerk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
it
will
not
be
necessary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
