mr.
joseph
p.
allen
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
presenting
two
questions,
whether
or
not
the
court
below
is
in
conflict
with
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
sadler
against
pennsylvania
railroad
company
and
whether
or
not
in
holding
that
proximate
cause
could
not
be
established
by
circumstantial
evidence
and
whether
or
not
the
court
below
deviated
from
the
principles
annunciated
from
lavender
v.
kurn.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
neither
one
of
these
questions
are
actually
presented
in
this
case.
the
court
below
neither
the
trial
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
proximate
cause
could
not
be
established
by
a
circumstantial
evidence,
but
explicitly
held
that
this
case
came
within
the
language
in
lavender
v.
kurn
that
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
probative
facts
which
we
form
evidentiary
basis
leading
to
a
conclusion
that
any
negligence
in
the
part
of
the
defendant
contributed
to
the
death
of
the
decedent.
most
of
the
facts
have
been
developed
through
extensive
use
of
a
discovery
and
inspection
procedure
and
most
of
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
the
decedent
was
assigned
to
watch
four
tugboats
on
christmas
night,
1949.
he
reported
late
for
work.
in
the
meantime,
another
watch
fireman
had
been
assigned
to
check
these
four
boats,
that
watched
fireman
built
up
the
fires,
pump
water
into
the
boilers
and
then
turn
the
injectors
off
by
which
he
had
pumped
water
into
the
boilers.
if
the
concluding
of
that
job
on
the
four
boats
to
which
the
decedent
had
been
assigned,
he
met
decedent
at
approximately
five
o'clock.
they
then
return
to
the
crew
dispatcher's
office
at
which
time
the
decedent
announced
to
the
crew
dispatcher
and
the
witness,
barker,
that
he
was
going
to
check
his
boats
and
he
would
return.
he
did
check
his
boats
and
he
did
return
to
the
crew
dispatcher's
office
at
seven
o'clock.
that
is
the
last
that
anyone
saw
of
the
decedent.
when
he
left
the
crew
dispatcher's
office,
walking
down
pier
h
towards
the
four
boats
to
which
he
had
been
assigned.
it
was
then
approximately
seven
to
07:15
at
night.
now
from
there,
there
is
a
almost
a
complete
blank
or
a
complete
gap
in
the
evidence
with
respect
to
what
happened
and
disputably,
the
injector
was
turned
off
by
mr.
barker
at
five
o'clock
and
disputably,
andre,
the
next
watchman
who
came
on
duty
at
11
o'clock
found
the
injector
on.
now,
the
injector
according
to
the
testimony
in
the
record
has
a
two
full
purpose.
one,
it
is
used
to
pump
water
into
the
boiler,
and
two,
when
the
boiler
gets
hot,
it
is
turn
on,
the
injector
is
turned
on
manually.
again,
the
--
being
to
put
water
into
the
boiler,
but
this
time
the
purpose
is
to
all
of
the
steam.
now,
with
the
respect
to
the
absence
of
any
probative
facts
as
held
by
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court,
what
the
petition
seeks
to
do
in
this
case
is
not
supply
probative
facts
by
either
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence,
but
he
seeks
to
advance
a
theory
not
based
on
any
facts
in
the
record
but
substituted
for
facts
which
was
permit
reasonable
inferences.
now,
his
theory
is
this,
as
i
understand
it
from
his
brief,
sometime
while
the
--
while
the
decedent
was
changing
his
clothes
preparatory
to
going
to
work,
an
emergency
arose
on
the
fourth
tug,
the
outboard
tug
of
the
four
to
which
he
had
been
assigned,
causing
him
or
making
it
necessary
for
him
to
drop,
to
stop
changing
his
clothes,
pick
up
his
flashlight
and
cross
from
the
first
boat
to
the
fourth
boat.
now,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
emergency?
that
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
injector
was
found
open
at
11
o'clock
by
the
next
watchman
to
come
on
and
it
indicates
that
the
emergency
was,
of
such
a
nature,
that
there
was
excessive
pressure
in
the
boiler
indicating,
if
that
were
true,
it
would
represent
a
dangerous
situation
with
respect
to
that
boat.
but
the
undisputed
testimony
is
that
if
there
is
excessive
pressure
in
a
boiler,
each
boiler
is
equipped
with
the
safety
valve
and
that
safety
valve
blows
off
the
excessive
steam
and
thus
at
least
temporarily
would
eliminate
that
emergency
and
that
noise,
which
that
safety
valve
gives
off
unquestionably
from
the
witnesses'
testimony,
can
be
heard
for
a
half-mile
and
there
isn't
any
evidence
in
this
record
and
any
number
of
witnesses
testified
who
were
in
this
vicinity.
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
that
anyone
heard
such
a
noise
as
would
be
given
off
if
the
safety
valve
blew.
now
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
it
was
christmas
night,
sir.
yes,
sir
and
there
were
people
around.
there
were
two
men
in
the
crew
dispatcher's
office.
there
was
an
assistant
road
foreman
engines
and
these
boats
were
set
up
in
tiers.
they
were
tied,
moored
abreast
to
one
side
of
the
dock.
and
each
boat
or
each
tier
of
boats
had
a
fire
watchman.
most
of
whom
testified
the
man
on
the
next
tier
--
in
the
second
tier
testified
some
of
the
man
--
one
of
the
man
on
the
fourth
tier
testified,
nobody,
who
was
present
on
that
dock,
on
that
evening,
heard
any
noise.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
that
maybe,
sir,
that
maybe.
but
in
any
rate,
there
is
no
evidence.
i
might
say
too
that
mr.
--
that
all
of
these
--
most
of
these
facts
were
developed
in
the
plaintiff's
case.
the
only
testimony
was
the
defendant
put
on
was
the
formalization
of
a
stipulation
concerning
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
complied
with
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
certainly,
it
would
be,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
no
because
he
couldn't
hear
it.
the
only
testimony
in
the
record,
it's
not
an
alarm,
sir.
it's
a
regular
safety
valve
and
the
noise
come
from
the
steam
admitting
--
being
admitted
through
the
safety
valve.
now,
he
went
on
board
with
those
boats
at
seven
o'clock
and
he
testified
that
he
had
fire
the
boat.
he
--
he
didn't
testify,
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
told
one
of
the
witnesses
that
he
had
checked
the
boats
at
seven
o'clock
and
barker,
the
fellow
who
had
checked
them
before
him,
said
that
he
had
fixed
the
fire
so
it
will
run
for
one-half
to
two
hours,
which
would
take
the
fire
up
to
about
seven
o'clock.
in
other
words,
i
think
it's
just
as
reasonable
that
mr.
schulz
turn
that
injector
on,
on
the
outboard
boat
when
he
went
aboard
at
seven
o'clock
because
that's
about
the
time
according
to
the
preceding
witness
from
this
--
he
would
have
had
attend
to
those
fires
because
the
water
would
have
lasted
for
an
hour
and
half
to
two
hours
when
he
came
on
about
between
six
or
seven
o'clock
when
he
checked
his
boats.
he
would
have
put
it
on
then
and
sometime
in
that
interim.
from
then
on,
he
unspeakably
disappeared.
now,
mr.
baker
mentioned
something
about
ice.
the
only
testimony
with
respect
to
the
ice
was
one
of
the
witnesses
have
said
that
the
--
the
temperature
as
far
as
he
recollect
was
10
above
zero.
on
page
82
of
the
record,
however,
is
the
official
weather
report
of
the
temperatures
recorded
at
battery
place,
new
york
city
which
is
just
across
the
river
from
pier
h.
and
that
weather
report
shows
that
the
temperature
varied
from
five
o'clock
in
the
night
in
question.
it
was
40
degrees
until
sometime
later
in
the
day
--
later
the
next
day.
in
the
afternoon,
the
temperature
kept
rising
until
it
was
approximately
50
degrees
and
in
middle
50s
the
following
day.
one
witness
testified
there
was
ice
and
that
was
a
witness
who
was
assigned
to
watch
boats
in
the
next
tier
and
he
testified
that
he
saw
ice.
but
he
testified
that
the
only
place
he
saw
the
ice
was
on
the
front
bumping
mat
--
the
front
bumping
mat
of
the
four
boats
to
which
the
decedent
had
been
assigned.
and
in
connection
with
that
with
respect
to
the
lights,
it's
undisputed
that
there
were
two
floodlights
at
the
outer
end
of
the
pier,
500
watts
was
used
to
reflect
this
which
shown
down
and
there
are
also
floodlights
from
the
both
head
side
of
the
pier
from
inland.
it
was
also
shown
out
in
the
pier
and
the
testimony
establishes
that
those
lights
illuminated
the
entire
pier
and
portions
of
the
boat
at
least
at
the
very
least
portions
of
the
boat,
giving
every
--
given
the
benefit
of
every
favorable
inference
to
the
petitioner.
at
least
portion
of
the
boats
were
illuminated.
now
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes
sir,
the
bows.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
well,
the
--
the
pier
is
600
feet
long,
sir,
and
at
the
end
of
the
pier
600
feet
after
milan
is
a
two-storey
crew
dispatcher's
house.
on
top
of
which
are
two
floodlights
throwing
light
inland.
the
boats
which
we
are
concern
are
approximately
300
feet
from
that
crew
dispatcher's
shack.
then,
inland
another
300
feet
is
the
--
is
the
boat
head
and
then
125
feet,
i
believe,
further
inland
are
another
series
or
bank
of
floodlights
projecting
the
light
out.
now,
one
of
the
witnesses
specifically
said
that
that
illuminated
the
bows
of
all
the
boats,
but,
of
course,
there
were
shadows
resulting
from
the
superstructures
of
the
tugs.
in
addition
to
which
the
man,
of
course,
carried
flashlights
as
the
decedent
did.
i
think
it
was
found
incidentally
--
he
was
found
not
--
over
a
month
later
january
31st.
he
was
discovered
floating
in
the
water
at
a
pier.
i
think
two
piers
away
from
the
pier
on
which
he
was
assigned.
in
the
court
below,
the
petitioner
strenuously
urged
that
the
ice,
the
presence
of
ice,
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
ice,
was
some
evidence
of
negligence
which
could
be
causally
related
to
the
decedent's
death.
but
in
his
brief
on
that
point
in
this
court,
that
is
apparently
abandoned.
and
it's
abandoned
because
the
petitioner
apparently
agrees
with
the
court
of
appeals.
he
states
that
concededly
there
was
an
ice
all
over
the
pier.
there
was
an
ice
all
over
the
docks.
we
don't
know
the
place
from
where
the
decedent
fell,
hence,
we
can't
say
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
ice
is
causally
connected
with
decedent's
death.
the
same
exact
reasoning,
of
course,
applies
to
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
lights
as
the
court
of
appeals
so
stated,
that
concededly
not
all
the
tugs
were
dark.
the
tugs
themselves
had
no
lights
too.
true,
they
were
taken
out
of,
they
were
temporarily
removed
from
navigation
for
two
days,
but
the
lights
--
the
light
was
supplied
by
these
series
of
floodlights
and
as
one
of
the
witnesses
testified,
by
the
atmospheric
conditions.
that's
the
witness
who
testified
that
seeing
the
ice
on
the
front
bumping
mat.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
i
think
yes,
sir.
it
might
be.
i
think
that's
what
the
district
court
had
in
mind
when
the
district
court
said
there
--
there
is
some
evidence.
of
course,
what
trouble
the
district
court,
what
trouble
the
court
of
appeals,
based
on
this
case
of
johnson
versus
palma
which
was
in
this
court
twice
once
under
rule
50
(b)
on
a
technicality
of
the
motion
and
the
second
time,
certiorari
was
denied.
but
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
this
case
was
similar
to
the
johnson
case
in
which
the
decedent
on
the
johnson
case
was
assigned
as
a
float
man.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
a
float
man,
sir.
his
tugs
were
going
to
remove
two
floats
which
were
tied
up
to
two
bridges
in
the
east
river.
his
job
was
to
release
the
lines.
now,
what
he
did
was
leave
his
tug
across
the
float,
release
one
line
and
then
cross
a
bridge
and
release
another
line.
when
he
did
that,
the
captain
of
the
ship
lost
sight
of
him,
but
the
captain
did
hear
a
shout
of
all
gone
indicating
that
the
line
had
been
cleared.
they
never
found
the
decedent.
he
was
missing
and
some
two
hours
later
after
they
had
made
a
short
journey,
they
came
back
and
the
decedent's
body
was
found
in
the
water.
now,
in
that
case,
judge
(inaudible)
the
district
court
rely
upon
the
original
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
have
been
reversed
on
the
--
on
different
grounds
stated
that
the
complete
absence
of
any
evidence
whether
it
would
be
circumstantial
or
direct
as
to
the
place
of
the
accident,
the
wherever
of
the
accident
or
the
how
of
the
accident
may
avoid
a
gap
in
the
evidence
which
in
the
--
within
the
language
of
lavender
v.
kurn
presented
just
the
type
of
case,
which
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
any
probative
facts
which
could
form
the
basis
for
an
inference
that
any
--
any
negligence
was
causally
related
to
the
death
of
the
decedent.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
i
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
i
would
say
--
with
some
qualifications,
i
would
say
yes,
that
it
was
reasonable
to
infer
that
something
happened
which
caused
him
to
leave
the
boat,
something
happened
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
--
personal
or
duty.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir,
i
would.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
with
only
one
exception
and
i
have
tried
to
riddle
out,
if
he
dropped
something.
while
changing
his
clothes,
where
he
changes
his
clothes
is
levelled
with
the
deck
and
the
deck,
as
i
understand,
it
steps
right
out.
he
might
have
taken
off
his
trouser,
dropped
something,
picked
this
flashlight
up
and
gone
out
for
his
own
purposes.
but
you
see
the
difficulty
with
that,
sir,
is
to
where
it
gets
us
in
this
particular
case
is
that
we
don't
know
where
he
went.
and
--
if
--
when
you
read
the
record,
you'll
see
it's
quite
clear
that
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence,
sir,
i
would
say
this,
i
--
i
would
say
in
--
in
reaching
that
inference,
i
would
have
--
may
i
answer
the
question,
sir?
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
i
would
have
to
tie
them
with
the
question
of
--
of
the
burden
of
proof
and
i
can
formulate
any
number
of
theories
or
postulates
each
one
of
which
on
the
basis
of
this
record
will
be
equally
probable.
and
i
say
that
when
you
have
a
hypothesis
or
a
postulate
which
entails
liability
and
postulate
or
hypothesis
which
does
not
entail
liability
both
equal,
then
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
sustain
the
burden
of
proof
required
under
the
jones
act.
thank
you
very
much
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
allegation
of
insufficient
help
provided
the
decedent
on
the
night
in
question.
the
crew
dispatcher
upon
receiving
a
telephone
call
from
the
decedent
that
the
decedent
would
be
late
for
work
advised
the
decedent
to
come
to
work
anyways
since
if
he
did
not
it
would
leave
his
trick
or
shift
one-man
short.
another
watch
fireman
testified
that
he
recalled
hearing
some
work
--
hearing
some
word
that
the
middle
shift
to
which
the
decedent
had
been
assigned
was
short.
he
testified
that
the
witness,
andre,
who
was
to
be
watch
fireman
who
relived
the
decedent
testified
that
it
was
difficult
for
one
man
to
take
care
of
four
boats
to
which
the
decedent
admittedly
had
been
assigned.
he
didn't
testify
or
indicate
in
any
way
that
it
would
be
more
dangerous
but
he
testified
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
that
he
couldn't
properly
take
care
of
the
boats,
and
maintaining
the
fires,
and
maintaining
the
water
in
the
boilers
and
doing
the
jobs
which
watch
fireman
were
required
to
do.
admittedly,
the
decedent,
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
was
the
only
man
on
this
night
assigned
to
watch
four
boats.
however,
the
witness,
barker,
who
in
the
decedent's
absence
had
taken
care
of
the
decedent's
boats,
for
that
period
of
time,
i
think
from
about
five
o'clock,
around
five
o'clock,
was
actually
taken
care
of
three
of
his
own
boats
and
the
four
boats
to
which
the
decedent
had
been
assigned
and
the
crew
dispatcher
testified
that
it
was
not
unusual
to
assign
a
watch
fireman
to
watch
four
boats.
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
help
in
--
in
and
of
itself
is
no
way
connected
or
can
be
connected
with
the
death
of
the
decedent
and
i
think
that
the
case
on
this
aspect
is
governed
by
the
same
principles
as
governed
the
case
of
reynolds
against
atlantic
coast
line.
in
that
case,
the
allegation
also
was
that
the
decedent
had
not
been
supplied
with
sufficient
help.
he
was
a
freight
brakeman
on
a
moving
train
and
his
job
was
to
cross
between
cars
of
a
moving
train
to
signal
to
the
engineer
at
the
time
when
a
switching
movement
was
to
be
--
was
to
be
made.
it
was
--
it
was
testified
--
it
was
--
or
there
was
an
allegation
that
the
reynolds
case
was
disposed
off
on
a
demurrer
made
in
the
complaint,
but
the
allegation
was
that
because
the
respondent
had
not
supplied
the
decedent
with
an
additional
brakeman,
he
had
to
make
an
additional
crossing.
he
had
to
make
one
more
crossing
between
cars.
but
the
court
of
alabama
and
it
was
sustained
by
this
court
on
a
peculiar
decision,
stated
that
the
fact
that
he
had
to
make
this
additional
crossing
was
no
more
hazardous
than
the
work
which
he
ordinarily
performed.
and
what
for
the
intervention
of
some
other
force,
it
could
not
have
caused
his
fall
which
was
as
in
this
case
completely
unexplained
as
to
why
or
how
he
had
fallen
from
the
train
and
that
resulted
in
--
an
affirmance
in
this
court
of
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
first
of
all,
as
i
--
there
were
three
elements
as
i
understand
which
the
petitioner
relies
upon.
i
think
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
condition
of
the
--
of
the
ice
on
the
barges
is
untenable
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
weather
report
clearly
established
it
was
40
degrees.
nobody
testified
that
they
saw
ice.
the
only
testimony
with
respect
to
the
ice
was
that
it
was
on
the
front
bumping
mat,
a
place
in
which
the
decedent
could
not
possibly
have
been
at
any
time.
with
respect
to
the
lights
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir,
it
was
40
degrees.
it's
--
it's
at
page
82
of
the
record.
the
temperature
was
40
degrees
at
5
p.m.
and
then
it
steadily
increased
until
later
in
the
day
--
next
day
which
we're
not
concerned
with
--
it
got,
as
i
remember
correctly,
up
to
the
middle
50.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
no,
sir.
the
record
shows
the
complete
weather
report
is
in
the
record
at
page
82
and
it
shows
the
hourly
temperatures
at
battery
place,
new
york
city
just
across
the
river
and
it
shows
it's
increasing
from
40
degrees
to
41
to
42
throughout
the
night.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
i
would
say
no,
sir,
but
that
is
not
clear
in
the
record.
it's
--
it's
the
evidence
which
was
placed
in
the
record
by
the
petitioner
here
as
being
obtained
in
response
to
an
inquiry
from
the
weather
bureau,
i
understand,
and
they
supplied
them
information,
the
petitioner
placed
it
in
the
record.
it's
only
a
short
distance
across
the
river,
sir.
with
respect
to
the
lighting,
sir,
the
--
unquestionably
is
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
pointed
out
and
as
the
record
establishes
and
as
the
petitioner's
brief
establishes,
there
is
no
question
but
that
these
floodlights
at
the
outboard
into
the
dock
and
the
inboard
in
beyond
the
bulkhead
illuminated
the
entire
pier
and
some
portions
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
tugboats,
in
addition
to
which
all
of
the
men
were
given
a
flashlight.
now,
that
is
some
dispute
as
to
that
testimony
as
to
why.
some
said
that
it
was
necessary
when
they
went
below
because
there
were
no
lights
on
these
boats.
they
were
taken
out
of
navigation
temporarily
for
one
or
two
days.
all
the
men
said
that
they
used
it
around
the
boats.
one
of
the
witnesses,
however,
who
was
in
the
second
tier
or
the
fourth
tier,
i
think,
it
was
not,
but
it
was
the
next
tier
to
the
decedent's
boats,
said
that
he
--
he
didn't
have
to
use
his
flashlight
walking
around
these
boats
and
that
is
the
closest
evidence
with
respect
to
what
the
conditions
were
at
about
this
time.
in
addition,
the
assistant
road
foreman
of
engines
stated
that
the
pier
was
lit
up
and
this
--
it
was
lit
up
like
daylight.
with
respect
to
the
allegation
of
--
of
the
lights,
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
he
apparently
abandons
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
ice
and
he
states
at
page
26
that
he
does
this
because,
concededly,
the
barge
or
the
boats
in
the
dock
was
not
completely
covered
with
ice
and
therefore
it
cannot
be
causally
related.
i
think
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
with
equal
force
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
that
unquestionably
since
this
complete
area
was
not
in
complete
darkness
that
cannot
be
causally
related
with
a
fall
of
the
decedent.
i
think
with
respect
to
the
insufficient
help,
again,
without
the
intervention
of
some
other
force,
we
admit
the
fact
alone,
if
conceding
or
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
that
there
was
insufficient
help,
that
could
not
contribute
to
the
decedent's
death.
it
didn't
make
his
work
any
more
hazardous.
it
perhaps
made
it
--
if
it
did
made
it
more
difficult,
made
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
properly
tend
to
the
four
boats.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir.
his
--
his
words,
if
i
remember
exact
--
correctly,
there
is
some
evidence
of
negligence
but
not
a
shred
of
evidence
which
would
causally
connect
it
with
the
decedent's
accidental
death.
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
then
said
that
the
evidence
of
negligence
however
is
doubtfully
sufficient
to
take
it
to
the
jury
and
in
beyond
--
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
no
evidence
which
would
causally
connect
it
to
the
decedent's
death.
there
--
there
is
an
--
an
additional
point
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
proceeding
under
the
right
act
here
which
has
never
been
determined
in
either
court
below
but
it
is
important
to
the
petitioner's
case
because
they
must
necessarily
establish
that
the
decedent
was
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act
and
a
member
of
the
crew
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
our
position
briefly
on
that
is
that
the
decedent
was
not
a
member
of
the
crew.
he
was
assigned
to
watch
these
four
tugboats
and
he,
on
the
next
night
or
the
night
previous,
he
could
have
been
assigned
to
watch
any
number
of
other
tugboats.
he
didn't
have
any
permanent
connection
with
any
one
of
these
ships.
he
lived
ashore,
he
ate
ashore,
he
had
locker
facilities
ashore.
he
was
not
on
board
primarily
to
aid
the
navigation.
his
job,
i've
compared
them
to
those
of
a
watchman.
his
job
was
to
take
care
of
the
flyers,
to
take
care
of
the
water
in
the
boilers
and
generally
to
see
if
the
ships
were
in
condition.
they
were
taken
out
of
navigation
temporarily
and
admittedly
were
to
go
back
after
the
holiday.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
he
had
no
permanent
connection
with
any
of
these
ships,
he
was
not
on
board
primarily
to
aid
the
navigation,
mitigates
against
the
finding
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew.
in
addition
to
that,
i
personally
find
it
difficult
to
visualize
how
he
could
be
a
member
of
--
of
a
crew
of
four
different
ships.
i
have
no
difficulty
with
accepting
the
fact
that
one
man
can
--
can
be
the
crew
of
a
ship,
but
i
have
difficulty
establishing
into
my
own
satisfaction
that
one
man
can
be
a
member
of
four
crews
or
be
the
crew
of
four
ships.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
in
--
in
that
--
in
that
contention,
sir,
the
--
the
--
our
position
has
always
been
that
the
proper
remedy
is
the
compensation
act.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir.
we
have
--
we
have
maintained
that
in
the
district
court.
we
--
it
wasn't
--
it
was
argued
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
not
orally,
but
we
have
--
or
on
the
record
stating
that
the
proper
remedy
for
the
petition
that
they
pursue
in
this
case
is
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes,
sir,
the
--
the
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
no,
sir.
the
decedent
has
protected
her
rights
under
that
statute
as
i
understand
that
she
has
filed
the
necessary
papers
to
protect
their
interest.
in
summary,
i
would
just
like
to
distinguish
briefly
the
case
of
sadler
against
pennsylvania
railroad
company
and
lavender
v.
kurn
by
stating
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
place
of
accident
was
definitely
ascertained.
in
--
in
the
sadler
case,
the
--
the
decedent
was
found
threading
the
water
between
the
two
barges
and
the
inference,
of
course,
was
inescapable
that
he
had
fallen
from
that
point
right
above
the
water
at
which
point
admittedly
the
lighting
was
poor.
completely
different
from
this
case
where
the
place
of
accident
cannot
be
established
by
evidence
by
circumstantial
or
direct
evidence.
in
--
the
same
thing
as
true
of
lavender
v.
kurn
where
the
place
of
accident
was
established
at
a
mound
near
the
defendant's
right-of-way
and
the
reasonable
inference
there
was
that
the
decedent
had
been
injured
at
that
place
by
--
by
the
passing
train
when
the
nail
hooks
swung
out.
those
cases
--
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
i
think
--
then,
if
there
was
some
mark,
if
there
was
a
broken
rail
or
some
indication
from
where
he
fell
and
it
was
a
point
at
which
there
was
some
darkness,
some
ice,
yes,
sir,
then,
i
think
it
would
come
within
the
sadler
against
pennsylvania
railway.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
where
or
how,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
allen
yes.
i
think
that
there's
an
inference
as
to
when
--
the
inference
as
to
when
being
determined
by
the
fact
when
he
was
last
seen,
when
he
was
discovered
missing,
that
narrows
it
down
or
maybe
a
four-hour
period.
but
there's
no
permissible
inference
here
as
to
from
where
he
fell
or
how
he
fell
or
as
the
district
court
in
palmer
v.
johnson
added
as
to
why
he
fell.
thank
you
very
much.
