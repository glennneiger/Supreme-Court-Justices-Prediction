where
was
the

justice

what
part
of
it?
justice

you
said
they
found
what
for
three
hours?
justice

what
was
the
weather?
justice

very
cold?

what
happened

justice

l.
black
what
happened
when
the
injectors
is
put
on?
does
it
--
justice

l.
black
and
then
what
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
don't
take
it
off,
what
happen?
you
say
this
was
not
taken
off.
justice

black
did
the
evidence
show
whether
it
was
disputed
to
go
from
boat
to
boat
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
he
fell
on?
justice
hugo

black
that
was
his
duty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
none
of
them
are
members
here
though?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
an
unreasonable
inference
that
the
--
the
reason
the
man
couldn't
draw
the
inference,
that
the
man
who
was
in
the
boat,
i
suppose
the
reason
they
weren't
--
they
found
later,
and
it's
his
duty
to
go
out
with
his
underclothes
on,
a
flashlight
in
his
hand
as
he
went
out
of
there
because
he
wanted
go
out
to
perform
his
duty
and
that
he
didn't
go
out
--
that
he
went
out
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
either
by
one
cause
or
another
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
that
he
fell
off
the
boat?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
say
that
it
also
was
a
reasonable
inference
if
he
was
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
that
he
had
his
flashlight
in
his
hands
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
like
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
he
fell
off
the
boat,
would
you
suppose
that
the
man
would
be
a
very
unreasonable
man
in
the
ordinary
walks
of
life
if
we
reach
the
conclusion
under
those
circumstances,
if
he
knew
the
boat
was
unlighted
and
faced
it,
he
didn't
have
--
had
ice
on
it
in
some
places.
that
the
man
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
probably
fell
off
with
his
flashlight
in
his
hand
and
stayed
there
with
him
after
he
died.
does
that
sound
like
an
--
an
inference
that
a
reasonable
man
couldn't
meet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
exhibits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
exhibits,
yes.
