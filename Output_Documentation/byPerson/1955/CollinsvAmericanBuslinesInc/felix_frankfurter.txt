justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
explaining
the
subject
to
mean
if
--
do
tell
us,
the
arizona
compensation
awards
are
greater
than
the
--
than
the
california
award,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
an
insurance
for
the
greater
would
take
care
of
the
lesser.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
i
don't
quite
follow
it.
but
they
would
have
to
carry
it
both,
they
could
carry
the
insurance
that
could
inevitably
has
a
lesser
included
to
greater
that
has
to
insure
in
both
--
that
happens
to
both
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
automatically
insured
from
the
state,
in
the
arizona
state
fund?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
let
me
ask
you
a
further
question.
is
there
any
disadvantage
in
driving
into
--
to
insure
outside
rather
on
the
fund?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
usually
what
the
matter
in
insuring
cost.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
it
trouble
you
if
before
you
go
into
our
cases,
you
would
stick
on
your
proposition,
the
propositions
of
law
you're
sending
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
as
a
general
problem.
i
--
i
think
the
issue
is
a
little
matter
about
the,
i
mean,
this
--
this
does
not
--
it's
because
of
the
argument
or
the
suggestion
of
intention
that
it
would
require
the
practical
services
that
carry
--
they
take
out
to
cover
insurance
and
the
cost
of
another
insurance
or
the
insurer
which
is
appreciately
--
i
take
it,
there
must
be
this
--
it
can't
be
negligible,
appreciably
higher
than
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
if
arizona
could
constitutionally
--
i'm
sorry,
the
right
to
insurance
to
cover
out
of
state
injury,
then
the
problem
wouldn't
arise,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
that
it
was
a
--
the
problem
is
narrow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
it's
the
whole
concept
of
burden
implied
financial
burden
or
at
least
predominantly
involved
financial
burden.
that's
the
burden
implied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
picture
that
gave
this
court
some
trouble
on
your
statute
first
came
before
us
25
years
ago,
whenever
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
to
elaborate
it
on
me,
mr.
franks,
to
ask
you
this,
as
you
state
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
mr.
franks,
and
it
appears
from
the
brief
filed
in
here,
the
american
buslines
are
not
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
not
here.
just
one
in
the
standing
ordered
basis
that
the
state
claim
that
an
award
doesn't
pay
and
has
to
be
paid
by
the
employer
is
a
burden,
isn't
it?
what
is
the
state's
interest
or
legal
claim
encouraging
that
the
commerce
clause
bars
or
limits
the
state's
power
to
give
an
award
which
employer
--
to
which
the
employer
does
not
object?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
think
--
think
that
the
decision
is
on
the
ground
that
the
commerce
clause
limits
(inaudible),
in
what
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
its
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
the
depletion
of
state
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
depletion
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
burden
--
that's
a
burden
upon
commerce,
how
was
that
in
--
how
did
the
burden
on
commerce
with
result
of
the
depletion
of
the
fund?
i
know,
because
in
that
extent,
the
state
funds
are
less.
but
where
in
the
--
where
--
what's
your
position
in
saying
that
the
commerce
is
a
burden?
we're
not
engaging
in
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
isn't
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
it
--
i
can
hear
you
would
object
in
the
court
on
--
i
think,
on
the
merits.i
can
hear
a
ground
of
due
process
that
you
or
for
the
person
and
the
award
is
paid
by
the
state
department
only
if
the
--
if
the
bus
line
is
--
it's
insured
in
the
state
fund
in
this
instance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
long
as
the
--
song
long
as
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
long
as
the
busline
would
get
premium
into
the
state
fund,
you're
not,
at
this,
affected.
i
can
see
that
the
argument
that
if
this
prevails,
then
the
interstate
cash
would
no
longer
insure
in
the
state
fund
and
to
that
extent,
if
that
that
--because
this
is
kind
of
a
plain
offense
to
commerce
clause
and
affects
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
how
is
--
how
--
how
you
in
a
position
to
maintain
does
a
burden
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
full
case
turned
on
throughout
that
this
has
involved
a
burden
on
commerce,
was
the
alternate
below
with
the
carriers,
did
the
carrier
push
the
argument
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
be
said?
suppose
this
case
here,
this
briefing
(inaudible),
your
appropriate
suggestion
a
little
a
while
ago
to
the
court,
you
have
in
mind
what
kind
of
mandate
issued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
quite
follow
what
it
was
that
the
company
do
but
suppose
this
--
a
different
issue,
suppose
this
court
in
finding
that
there
was
a
federal
question,
finding
that
in
fact
the
decision
turned
on
--
on
a
construction
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
suppose
this
court
should
live
and
the
assumed
limitation
upon
the
state's
power
derived
from
the
commerce
clause
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
this
case,
this
court
would
send
the
case
saying
that
--
that
limitation
that
--
you
can
think
that's
a
constitutional
worry
of
your
mind
and
you
can
pray
this,
as
it's
been
indicated.
this
judgment
is
different
in
direction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
this
position
and
can
--
not
inconsistent
in
what
this
court
does.
if
this
case
goes
back,
can
your
state
court,
does
your
state
court
free
this
record
to
say
there
is
a
defect
aim
on
the
state
law
and
you
can't
have
this
award
under
the
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
for
this
court
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
that,
that's
a
purely
state
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
wanted
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
thought
that
was
supposed
to
be
on
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
dare
say
there
is
a
quick
answer
that
in
my
own
mind
and
i
had
a
little
struggle
with
this,
where
in
arizona's
interest
claimed
there's
burden
on
commerce,
it's
a
rather
unusual
thing
for
a
state
to
say
what
have
been
--
that
we
can't
do
this
because
there's
a
burden
on
commerce
to
be
immediately
affect
the
party
basing
on
claim.
i'm
sure
--
it
must
be
a
quick
answer
but
i
don't
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
they
find
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
found
reason
for
their
own
statute,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
we
could
say
that
they
find
reasons
on
their
own
statute,
we
would
have
to
dismiss
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
own
suggestion
is
that
a
state,
any
state
as
a
member
of
the
union
could
say,
“we
deny
that
they
have
power
of
the
state
because
as
a
faithful
member
of
the
union,
we,
as
our
business,
affects
the
commerce
clause
and
we
have
to
deny
those
powers
because
they
want
to
respect
the
commerce
clause.”
is
that
it?
is
that
the
last
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
be
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
--
you
can
make
that
position
perfectly
easy.
as
a
matter
of
law
--
i
mean,
as
a
matter
o
law,
there's
no
difficulty
where
the
state,
taking
that
position
in
the
construction
of
its
statute
wherein
it's
a
different
stage,
they
say
there's
a
constitutional
compulsion
that
they
have
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
a
suggestion
.what
i
get
from
your
--
what
i
get
perhaps
unjustifiably
from
your
--
what
i
heard
from
what
you
say
is
that
you
really
think
the
court
should
have
been
--
should
have
gone
on
the
state
ground,
and
on
the
whole
level,
it's
a
very
considerable
reason
while,
in
fact,
consciously
or
unconsciously,
they
did.
and
then,
mr.
frank
makes
a
suggestion
having
had
a
reason
to
experience
with
the
commerce
clause,
there
are
very
alert
students
of
the
commerce
clause
and
a
lot
of
them
waived
through
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
--
this
is
an
illustration
of
alert
regards
by
the
state,
by
an
alert
respect
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
seriously
consider
a
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
we
seriously
consider
a
problem?
