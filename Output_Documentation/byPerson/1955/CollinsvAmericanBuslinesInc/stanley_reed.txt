but
if
--
if
he
insured

the
employer
would
be
protected
in
both
states
and
so
would
the
employee.
justice
stanley
reed
he
insured
with
the
fund
in
california.
justice
stanley
reed
but
the
--
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
would
be
protected
as
the
california
being
the
residence
of
the
employee.
so,
by
insuring
under
the
california
upon
the
law,
he's
protected
in
accordance
with
the
california
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
--
but
he
got
the
workmen's
compensation
wherever
he
went?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
actually
wouldn't
do
that
if
they
could
get
full
protection
from
california.
justice
stanley
reed
and
they
--
they
would
have
the
full
protection
of
the
california
law
in
an
arizona
accident.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
but

justice
stanley
reed
but

him
in
california
for
an
accident
that
took
place
in
arizona.
justice
stanley
reed
perhaps
you
said
(inaudible)
does
this
company
have
workmen's
compensation
insurance
in
arizona?
justice
stanley
reed
what
did
it
do
with
the
--
what
do
you
do
in
the
arizona
--
justice
stanley
reed
no,
no,
do
you
--
do
you
take
out
of
policy?
do
you
notify
the
--
the
workmen's
compensation
board
if
you're
carrying
insurance
there
and
to
pay
half
a
portion
of
your
wages?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
your
--
your
view
to
this
--
to
this
company
carry
workmen's
compensation
under
the
arizona
--
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
franks.
justice
stanley
reed
now,
what
--
what
is
that
first
conclusion?
justice
stanley
reed
and
therefore,
it
was
not
covered
in
your
act?
justice
stanley
reed
and
that
still
stands?
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
counsel,
would
you
call
my
attention
again
or
--
if
you
said
that
the
--
the
arizona
court
relied
partly
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
party
had
ensured
in
california?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
--
what
happened
below,
was
it
not
mr.
franks
that
the
commission
was
ordered
to
dismiss
this
claim
that
had
been
filed
with
it?
i
don't
find
any
--
any
mandates
here
except
on
page
39
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
stanley
reed
and
that
--
and
that
was
on
the
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
don't
--
don't
look
for
it.
justice
stanley
reed
and
they
--
and
they
had
held
that
these
parties
were
not
entitled
to
recover
under
the
act
of
arizona?
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
that.
justice
stanley
reed
now,
--
now,
it
went
back
to
them.
it
will
--
when
it
goes
back,
it'll
go
back
to
the
point.
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
how
--
how
--
before
you
go
on,
could
--
justice
stanley
reed
how
did
these
people,
petitioners
here,
how
--
how
do
they
come
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act?
what
bring
--
the
--
the
statutes
bring
them
under
without
paying
anything
or
filing
anything,
or
saying
anything?
