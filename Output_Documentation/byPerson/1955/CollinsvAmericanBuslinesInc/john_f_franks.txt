mr.
john
f.
franks
may
it
please
the
court.
speaking
for
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona
and
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
this
instance,
we
bear
under
circumstances
that
are
somewhat
confusing
to
us.
i
just
recalled
that
when
counsel
was
asked
to
state
his
proposition,
he
stated
that
in
the
negative
and
it
is
that
negative
approach
that
it
--
confuses
us,
if
the
court
please.
the
instant
case
has
not
reached
this
court
on
the
basis
or
for
the
reasons
that
were
present
in
southern
pacific
versus
arizona.
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
passed
upon
a
legislative
enactment
of
the
state
of
arizona
which
placed
certain
restrictions
upon
an
interstate
carrier.
the
arizona
court
upheld
the
state
legislation
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
burden
upon
the
federal
commerce.
in
that
case,
the
court
or
the
state
of
arizona
took
an
affirmative
action.
it
placed
what
was
finally
deemed
by
this
court
to
be
a
burden
upon
a
free
flow
of
commerce
between
the
states.
now,
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
type
of
argument,
which
was
afforded
in
the
southern
pacific
case,
was
positive
argument
on
both
sides,
and
i
do
not
find
that
in
the
instant
case.
here,
in
collins
versus
american
buslines,
the
instant
case,
and
versus
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona,
they
find
that
neither
the
state
agency,
the
industrial
commission
nor
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
gave
sanction
to
any
act
or
practice
which
could
be
construed
to
interfere
in
any
manner
with
the
free
flow
of
commerce
between
the
state.
on
the
contrary,
if
the
court
please,
such
action
was
expressly
avoided.
and
hence,
even
though
we
haven't
been
inclined
to
burden
a
commerce
between
the
states,
we
find
ourselves,
before
this
court,
where
an
effort
is
apparently
being
made
by
petitioners
to
relieve
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
arizona
of
any
compulsions
that
it
may
have
had
regarding
the
effect
of
the
federal
commerce
clause
when
it
rendered
its
decision.
we
fully
appreciate,
of
course,
the
fact
that
this
court
has,
on
occasion,
taking
jurisdiction
in
order
to
pass
upon
an
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute
by
the
state
court
or
the
state
court
seemingly
interpreted
the
federal
statute
as
a
prohibition
against
certain
local
interpretation.
and
the
cases
are
cited
in
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
constitutes
the
record
in
this
case.
we
still
feel
in
the
instant
case
that
the
arizona
jurisdiction
should
be
left
to
its
own
state-level
interpretation
in
the
instant
fact
situation.
and
it
is
in
this
connection
that
we
appear
and
present
argument
in
behalf
of
the
state
agency
in
arizona
that
took
the
initial
position
in
this
case,
pursuant
to
an
earlier
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
the
watson
brothers
case
as
counsel
had
pointed
out.
now,
counsel
for
petitioner
has
taken
the
liberty
in
this
case
of
--
of
extending
his
brief
beyond
the
actual
paper
record
of
the
case
and
we
certainly
have
no
quarrel
with
that
under
the
circumstances.
this
particular
case,
if
i
might
point
out
to
the
court,
reached
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
under
a
rather
sketchy
record.
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
was
filed
with
this
--
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona,
and
a
hearing
was
held
before
that
body,
and
it
was
the
record
of
that
hearing
that
went
direct
to
the
supreme
court
to
the
state
of
arizona
on
certiorari.
the
hearing
record
was
rather
sketchy.
the
commission
merely
made
an
attempt
to
ascertain
whether
a
man
was
regularly
employed
in
arizona
under
the
ruling
of
the
prior
watson
case,
so
the
hearing
was
merely
concerned
with
ascertaining
where
the
man
lived,
where
and
was
he
employed,
and
whether
or
not
he
was
covered
in
the
state
of
california
under
the
california
workmen's
compensation
act.
and
of
course,
the
inquiry
was
made
regarding
dependents,
the
widow
status,
and
the
status
of
the
child.
the
case,
as
i
say,
reached
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
on
that
type
of
a
sketchy
record.
and
therefore,
we
find
it
necessary
here
to
refer
to
some
actual
situation,
some
aspects
of
the
situation
which
of
course
do
not
appear
in
the
actual
paper
record
before
this
court
now.
but
i'm
firmly
convinced
that
there
were
many
matters,
all
of
common
knowledge,
to
the
members
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
when
the
decision
in
the
case
was
entered,
and
that
they
must
have
had
an
effect
upon
the
court
in
the
reaching
of
this
result
which
we
have.
the
record
here
does
indicate
in
the
basic
fact
situation
that
we
do
have
a
carrier
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
there
is
no
dispute
over
the
fact
that
we
have
a
claim
for
death
benefits
under
the
arizona
workmen's
compensation
act
arising
from
the
accidental
death
of
an
employee
of
this
interstate
carrier
which
employee
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
california.
he
was
hired
in
the
state
of
california,
and
he
was
fully
covered
for
workmen's
compensation
benefits
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california.
his
work,
however,
like
many
of
the
other
employees
or
the
interstate
carriers,
required
him
to
be
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
state
of
arizona
at
certain
intervals.
now,
the
record
does
not
fully
show
the
exact
extent
and
nature
of
the
arizona
workmen's
compensation
act,
and
i
believe
that
it
is
important
to
consider
for
a
moment
some
of
the
peculiar
features.
we
can
describe
the
arizona
act
as
unique
among
the
acts
of
the
various
states.
to
begin
with,
in
arizona,
we
have
what
is
termed
an
"exclusive
remedy
act".
now,
that
alone
is
not
unique.
some
other
states
do
have
the
exclusive
remedy
act
but
not
all
of
them,
and
california,
new
mexico,
nevada,
colorado,
the
states
immediately
bordering
arizona
are
in
the
latter
category.
they
have
workmen's
compensation
acts,
or
schemes
or
patterns
of
workmen's
compensation
acts
which
are
not
in
the
exclusive
remedy
cover
--
category.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
that
is
the
case.
now,
in
the
exclusive
remedy
act,
in
the
absence
of
rejection
of
the
act
by
an
employee
prior
to
injury,
the
act
itself
is
deemed
by
law
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy
for
the
injured
employee,
and
the
exclusive
remedy
for
dependents
in
the
event
of
accidental
death.
the
arizona
act
is
also
one
of
extraterritorial
coverage
and
that
employees
hired
in
arizona
and
regularly
employed
in
arizona,
by
arizona
employers,
are
deemed
to
be
covered
under
the
arizona
act
even
though
performing
duties
for
their
employer
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
state
of
arizona.
we
didn't
have
a
feature
which
truly
makes
the
arizona
workmen's
compensation
act
unique.
it
is
an
act
of
unlimited
benefits
from
a
compensation
and
death
benefit
standpoint.
awards
in
arizona
in
workmen's
compensation
cases
are
based
upon
a
percentage
of
average
monthly
wage
and
permanent
disability
awards
can
continue
for
life
without
monthly
or
weekly
limitation.
likewise,
death
benefit
awards
to
widows
may
continue
for
the
life
of
the
widow
in
monthly
payments
based
upon
a
percentage
of
the
deceased's
average
monthly
wage.
from
the
underwriting
and
the
actuarial
standpoint,
and
in
the
fiscal
matters
pertaining
to
the
administration
of
the
arizona
workmen's
compensation
act,
the
act
is
one
where
the
state
fund
is
practically
a
monopolistic
fund.
it
is
not
an
act
that
attracts
the
interest
of
private
carriers
to
any
great
extent,
although,
the
act
is
written
to
permit
coverage
by
private
carriers
at
the
option
of
the
employer.
insurance
rates,
applicable
to
policies
carried
by
the
state
fund
in
arizona,
the
state
fund
administered
by
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona,
are
made
lower
by
statute
than
the
rates
applicable
to
policies
carried
through
the
private
carrier
companies.
our
act,
29
years
ago,
was
purposely
written
that
way
in
order
to
ensure
a
bulk
of
the
business
in
the
state
fund.
the
compilers
of
the
act
realized
that
the
state
fund
could
not
pay
the
enormous
benefits
provided
by
the
act,
unless
it
had
the
bulk
of
the
coverage.
and
therefore,
the
private
carrier
situation
was
discouraged,
although,
they
were
permitted
to
come
in
and
write
at
higher
rates.
the
rates,
which
private
carriers
must
charge
if
they
choose
to
become
qualified
in
the
first
instance
and
write
workmen's
compensation
insurance
in
arizona,
are
10%
higher
than
the
rates
applicable
in
the
state
fund.
now,
the
members
of
the
industrial
commission,
the
agency
which
controls
the
state
fund
and
which
also
controls
the
underwriting
phases
of
all
coverages
under
the
act,
has
no
power
to
make
a
selection
of
coverage
for
the
employer.
the
employer
has
the
option
to
ensure
him
the
state
fund
if
he
chooses
to
do
so,
if
he
has
the
liability
in
arizona
under
the
act,
or
he
has
the
option
to
ensure
by
a
private
carrier
or
assuming
that
he
can
find
a
private
carrier
interested
in
his
business,
or
he
may
become
a
self-insure
under
the
act
by
meeting
certain
qualifications
regarding
financial
responsibilities,
size
of
his
operations
and
so
forth,
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
industrial
commission.
now,
i
mentioned
in
this
point
that
the
industrial
commission
has
no
power
to
make
this
selection
of
coverage
for
the
employer
because
one
of
the
main
arguments
of
petitioners
in
this
case,
in
urging
the
desired
result,
is
that
the
interstate
carrier
can
solve
all
of
his
problems
by
carrying
his
insurance
with
a
private
carrier
of
insurance
in
arizona.
we
say
that
such
contention
would
make
the
private
carrier
coverage
mandatory
in
such
an
instance
if
the
commission
were
to
tell
the
employer
that
he
must
go
to
a
private
carrier.
and
thus,
the
option,
specifically
given
by
the
statute,
would
be
nullified
and
certainly
the
employer
would
be
discriminated
against,
no
question
about
that.
the
act
gives
the
option
to
the
employer
when
he
has
a
liability
in
our
state.
now,
particular
attention
should
be
given
to
the
basis
for
benefits
under
the
arizona
act,
a
point
which
was
a
subject
of
comment
by
chief
justice
laprade
in
the
opinion
below.
a
statutory
basis,
as
i
have
stated,
is
the
average
monthly
wage
of
the
employee
when
we
consider
the
employee
in
interstate
commerce
or
i
should
say
the
employee
of
an
interstate
carrier
disregarding
the
interstate
commerce
feature.
such
as
the
employee
in
this
case,
we
find
a
man
who
has
an
overall
average
monthly
wage,
whether
he
earns
all
of
it
in
arizona
or
not.
only
a
part
of
that
wage
could
be
deemed
or
have
been
earned
in
arizona.
and
in
this
instance,
with
the
state
fund
carrier,
being
limited
to
insurance
premiums
on
the
arizona
portion
of
the
wage,
our
supreme
court
has
made
that
observation.
a
limitation
in
premium
collection
for
this
insurance
would
be
on
the
portion
of
the
wage
of
the
employee
earned
within
the
limits
of
the
state
of
arizona.
and
yet,
compensation
benefits
are
based
upon
the
overall
average
monthly
wage.
our
act
is
a
loss
of
earning
capacity
act
in
which
an
attempt
is
made
to
partially
at
least
restore
the
lost
earning
capacity
of
an
injured
man.
and
therefore,
his
overall
average
monthly
wage
constitutes
the
basis
for
compensation
benefits
and
a
great
portion
of
that
overall
monthly
wage,
in
this
instance,
is
not
the
source
of
charged
premiums
to
the
insurance
carrier,
in
this
instance,
the
state
fund
of
arizona.
now,
this
latter
situation,
as
i've
pointed
out,
was
the
subject
of
comment
in
the
opinion
below.
now,
with
this
type
of
situation
present,
one
can
readily
assume
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
had
difficulty
in
administering
its
workmen's
compensation
act,
particularly
with
reference
to
those
employees
who
were
actually
not
domiciled
in
arizona,
but
who
might
have
occasion
to
come
into
the
state
or
who
might
have
occasion
to
cross
over
the
state
at
intervals.
and
it
is
a
fact,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
has
been
a
great
amount
of
difficulty
in
this
respect.
once
again,
i
am
pointing
to
some
of
the
things,
taking
the
liberty
of
pointing
to
some
of
the
things
that
are
not
actually
in
the
paper
record
before
us.
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
the
watson
brothers
case,
a
1953
case,
cited
in
the
brief
and
mentioned
by
counsel,
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona
was
actually
groping
in
the
dark,
in
the
field
of
employers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
commission
was
attempting
to
cover
employees
of
such
employers
while
in
the
state
of
arizona.
and
in
doing
so,
it
had
to
consider
methods
of
collecting
premium
and
methods
of
determining
accurate
and
equitable
basis
for
computing
compensation
benefits,
with
premiums
being
limited
to
a
portion
of
a
wage,
with
compensation
benefits
being
based
upon
a
total
overall
average
monthly
wage.
interstate
employers
were
constantly
perplexed
regarding
the
extent
of
their
liabilities
and
their
responsibilities
in
the
state
of
arizona
and
there
were
numerous
controversies.
the
matter
finally
reached
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
when
the
watson
brothers
transportation
company
and
interstate
trucking
association
refused
to
pay
to
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona
insurance
premiums
on
alleged
coverage
for
certain
of
their
employees
who
happened
to
operate
in
the
state
of
arizona
at
certain
intervals.
the
situation,
as
it
existed
in
the
watson
brothers
case,
could
only
be
resolved
by
a
consideration
of
the
entire
workmen's
compensation
act
in
arizona.
and
the
court
in
that
case
gave
them
two
conclusions,
one,
to
the
effect
that
the
exacting
of
premiums
from
employers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
would
constitute
an
undue
burden
upon
the
free
flow
of
commerce
between
the
states.
and
secondly,
that
the
employees
actually
considered
in
the
watson
brothers
case
were
not
regularly
employed
in
the
state
of
arizona
under
the
statutory
definition
of
regular
employment.
this
latter
conclusion
was
abandoned
and
repudiated
in
the
instant
case,
the
collins
case,
but
the
first
conclusion
was
affirmed.
mr.
john
f.
franks
the
first
conclusion
was
that
to
impose
the
act
upon
employers
in
the
interstate
commerce
would
constitute
an
undue
burden
upon
the
interstate
commerce,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
one
of
the
conclusions
in
the
watson
brothers
case.
mr.
john
f.
franks
the
court,
mr.
justice
reed,
did
affirm
that
conclusion
in
the
instant
case
but
repudiated
the
other
conclusion
regarding
the
regular
employment,
yes.
but
i
would
point
out,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
this
case,
in
the
opinion
below,
the
court
did
make
this
positive
observation.
we
do
not
decline
jurisdiction,
merely
for
the
reason
that
decedent
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
but
in
view
of
an
additional
consideration
that
he
was
also
covered
in
another
jurisdiction.
now,
at
that
point,
the
court
is
not
speaking
of
duplicate
premium
requirements
or
the
cost
involved.
they're
speaking
solely
of
the
coverage,
coverage
in
another
jurisdiction.
and
at
another
point
in
the
decision
below,
again,
reference
is
made
to
double
coverage,
not
double
premium
or
double
cost,
but
double
coverage.
and
i
interpret
that
to
mean
coverage
under
the
act,
which
of
course
includes
all
of
the
facets
of
coverage,
the
obtaining
insurance,
the
--
becoming
a
party
litigate
to
controversies
that
might
arise
concerning
average
monthly
wage
and
questions
of
that
nature.
now,
even
though
the
court
below,
in
its
opinion,
seemingly
said
that
the
federal
commerce
clause
was
the
reason
for
its
position,
the
language
which
i've
just
quoted
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
court
actually
had
in
mind
the
effect
of
the
peculiar
provisions
of
the
arizona
act
upon
a
non-resident
employer
who
had
covered
his
employees
in
another
state.
and
i
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
in
this
way,
coverage
in
the
state
of
california,
for
instance,
involves
a
payment
of
premiums
to
the
state
of
california.
it
involves
being
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
state
and
the
forum
which
process
his
claims
and
the
other
forums
which
handle
the
underwriting
phases.
that
same
thing
would
have
to
be
true
in
the
state
of
arizona
if
the
employer
were
covered
in
arizona,
paying
premiums
in
arizona,
either
to
a
state
fund
or
to
a
private
carrier
authorized
to
ensure
in
arizona,
and
being
subject
to
the
forums
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
matters
of
litigation
and
coverage.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor.
a
great
deal
of
difference,
an
entirely
different
field,
the
workmen's
compensation
in
arizona
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes.
mr.
john
f.
franks
if
your
--
if
your
honor
please,
the
--
the
types
of
insurance
are
not
written
together.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
is
correct.
you'll
find
that
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
in
the
practice
of
the
insurance
field,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
i
doubt.
mr.
john
f.
franks
i
doubt
that
they
are
such
--
there
are
two
divergent
fields
and
aspects.
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
would
be
one
difference,
your
honor,
yes,
the
extended
coverage.
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
in
arizona,
the
coverage
is
entirely
different
than
it
might
be
in
another
state
due
to
the
tremendous
liability
in
arizona,
the
unlimited
liability,
higher
premiums.
basically,
higher
premiums
in
the
state
fund
plus
10%
higher
than
that
if
insured
with
a
private
carrier.
mr.
john
f.
franks
one
of
the
differences,
if
your
honor
please,
yes.
but
speaking
of
coverage
differences
in
type
of
procedure
and
a
duplicate
situation
in
being
subject
to
the
forums
of
another
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
f.
franks
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
assume
that
he
would
be,
no.
mr.
john
f.
franks
possibly
so,
your
honor,
and
if
they're
speaking
of
the
instance
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
of
course,
in
this
particular
case,
if
your
honor
please,
there
was
no
coverage
in
arizona
on
this
particular
employee.
but
if
they
had
been
covered,
then
he
would
have
coverage
in
california
under
the
california
act,
in
arizona
under
the
arizona
act,
an
entirely
different
act
of
benefits,
duplicate
coverage
as
i
see
it
in
two
different
places.
mr.
john
f.
franks
possibly
so,
your
honor.
under
--
we
do
have
extra
territorial
coverage
in
arizona.
in
other
words,
an
employee
in
arizona
higher
than
coverage
in
arizona
would
be
covered
if
out
into
another
state
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
of
business,
also
true
of
the
state
of
california,
yes,
which
would
fly
in
the
instant
case,
the
man
being
covered
in
california
and
injured
and
killed
in
arizona.
mr.
john
f.
franks
no,
mr.
justice
burton,
there
is
not.
i
believe
that
the
full
phase
in
credit
cases
cited
by
counsel
in
brief,
cases
of
this
court
in
that
respect,
would
take
care
of
that
situation
where
one
state
could
allow
a
deduction,
or
a
credit
for
a
recovery
made
in
another
state.
did
i
answer
your
honor's
question
in
that
respect?
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor,
that
--
i
believe
your
honor's
reference
is
to
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that
i
quoted.
that
particular
quotation
appears
on
--
beginning
at
page
21
of
the
record
which
happens
to
be
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
starts,
we
do
not
decline
jurisdiction
merely
for
the
reason,
etcetera.
well,
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
have
argued
in
this
case
due
to
the
effect
that
the
opinion
below
is
fully
justified
under
construction
of
the
state's
statutes
alone.
and
further,
it
would
have
to
be
our
position
that
a
finding
regarding
the
federal
commerce
clause
in
the
opinion
below
is
merely
an
immaterial
consideration
so
far
as
the
lower
court
was
concerned.
now,
we
are
naturally
concerned
with
the
type
of
mandate
that
this
court
might
seem
fit
to
give
to
the
arizona
court.
it
would
be
one
thing,
of
course,
to
relieve
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
of
any
compulsions
that
it
might
have
regarding
the
interstate
commerce
clause
in
this
instance.
on
the
other
hand,
in
checking
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
i
find
that
it
is
provided
that
in
all
cases
of
mandates
from
this
court,
the
clerk
shall
immediately
send
what
is
termed
a
remittitur
to
the
superior
court
as
referred
to
in
the
rule.
the
rule
of
course
does
not
say
anything
about
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
i
think,
when
the
rule
was
compiled,
they
probably
did
not
visualize
this
type
of
situation.
but
assuming
that
that
would
have
to
be
done,
then
i
would
maintain
that
that
would
end
the
matter
and
there
would
be
no
further
opportunity
to
argue
or
seek
any
clarification
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
but
we
also
say
in
this
case
that
the
effect
of
the
peculiar
workmen's
compensation
act
in
the
state
of
arizona
is
not
to
be
ignored
when
we
think
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
free
flow
of
commerce
between
the
state.
i
attempted
to
point
out
the
difficulties
in
administering
the
arizona
act
with
reference
to
premium
requirements
and
compensation
benefit
provisions
in
connection
with
employees
who
are
covered
in
another
state
but
who
happened
to
be
within
the
territorial
limits
of
arizona
at
interval.
the
record
has
been
one
of
subjecting
such
employees
or
the
employers
to
litigation
and
controversy;
a
controversy,
which
culminated
in
the
1953
case
of
watson
brothers.
now,
to
require
compliance
on
the
part
of
such
employers
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce,
subjects
them
to
many
uncertainties
regarding
the
status
of
their
operation.
it
subjects
them
to
hindrances
and
complications
in
the
matter
of
obtaining
insurance
coverage
that
the
employer
desire
uniformity
in
the
handling
of
his
insurance
business
or
coverage,
he
may
very
well
find
that
his
own
carrier
of
insurance
is
not
interested
in
the
state
of
arizona.
in
fact,
he
may
find
that
his
carrier
is
not
authorized
to
write
insurance
in
arizona.
out
of
hundreds
of
workmen's
compensation,
the
insurance
carriers
in
the
nation
and
in
the
world,
only
12
of
them
have
seen
fit
to
qualify
and
write
insurance
in
arizona.basically,
arizona
is
not
a
field
to
the
private
carrier.
and
yet,
those
employers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
are
generally
in
the
habit
of
dealing
with
the
private
carrier
in
other
states.
it's
true,
they
might
have
a
carrier
who
is
already
representing
them,
who
is
authorized
to
write
insurance
in
arizona,
but
in
this
instance,
they
find
that
the
rates,
which
the
private
carrier
must
charge
them,
are
10%
higher
than
the
rates
available
through
the
arizona
state
fund.
in
this
instance
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
the
--
the
state's
position,
i'm
speaking
of
the
--
referring
to
the
state,
it
would
be
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
the
state
agency
would
have
to
pay
the
award,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor,
the
employer
does
not
pay.
if
these
employees,
such
as
the
deceased
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor,
in
this
instance,
to
the
possible
amount
of
$60,000
or
$70,000,
yes,
that
is
what
would
be
involved.
mr.
john
f.
franks
without
premium,
if
i
may
state.
mr.
john
f.
franks
if
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
in
--
our
business,
as
an
insurance
underwriter,
which
we
are,
we
must
of
course
deal
with
that
situation.
if
people
--
if
--
if
people
of
this
nature
are
deemed
to
have
the
liability
in
arizona,
then
of
course,
they
have
an
insurable
liability
which
would
fall
on
the
state
fund
in
the
great
many
instances.
mr.
john
f.
franks
the
busline
is
insured
in
the
state
fund
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
excuse
me.
mr.
john
f.
franks
no,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
the
contention.
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
if
i
--
mr.
justice,
if
i
might
make
this
observation,
unfortunately,
we
are
arguing
the
federal
commerce
matter
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
here.
it
was
not
argued
below.
it
was
not
raised
below,
except
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
no,
your
honor,
the
carrier
did
not
appear
below.
the
matter
was
purely
between
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona
and
the
claimant,
but
the
record
before
the
commission
dealt
only
with
the
phase
of
the
prior
watson
brothers
case
regarding
regular
employment
in
arizona.
the
federal
commerce
clause
question
was
not
considered.
and
in
the
initial
arguments
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
arizona
at
the
briefing,
the
federal
question
was
not
pressed.
the
court
itself
seized
upon
the
commerce
clause
after
repudiating
the
portion
of
the
watson
brothers
case
that
the
industrial
commission
had
relied
upon.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes.
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
say
that
that
were
the
case
in
arizona
in
the
interest
of
the
state
fund.however,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could.
mr.
john
f.
franks
i
would
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
--
agree
with
you
whole-heartedly.
mr.
john
f.
franks
i
will
have
to
answer
that
in
this
way,
if
your
honor
please,
that
i
am
not
sure
what
the
result
would
be.
in
view
of
the
rules
of
court
in
arizona,
they
might
possibly
immediately
send
it
back
to
the
industrial
commission
and
say,
“pay,”
i
--
i
don't
know.
whether
we'd
have
an
opportunity
to
reexamine
the
matter
before
the
arizona
court,
i
do
not
know
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
are
urging
here
the
consideration
of
the
federal
question.
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
please,
to
me,
the
answer
here
is
simply
this,
that
the
courts
in
arizona
did
not
seem
fit
to
burden
interstate
commerce
and
refused
to
do
so.
they
took
no
affirmative
action
in
that
respect.
and
in
defining
what
they
did,
and
i'm
satisfied
that
they
had
ample
reasons
in
the
own
--
in
their
own
statutes
and
that
those
reasons
were
strong
in
the
minds
of
the
court.
following
the
watson
brothers
decision,
they
in
effect
said,
“our
act
is
not
applicable.”
and
then,
in
effect,
said,
“in
lieu
and
behold
here,
we
find
the
commerce
clause.”
mr.
john
f.
franks
now,
i'm
afraid
that's
what
happened,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
not
--
not
exactly,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
john
f.
franks
my
argument
would
be
that
when
a
state
feels
that
due
to
the
peculiar
scheme
--
scheme
perhaps
is
not
a
good
word,
although,
it's
used
in
the
case,
but
a
peculiar
pattern
or
system
of
our
own
acts,
our
own
statute
pertaining
to
the
field
of
workmen's
compensation,
when
we
feel
they
are
not
applicable
to
a
certain
situation
then
that
should
end
the
matter.
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes.
well,
i
certainly
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
that
is,
of
course,
the
main
reason
we're
here.
i'm
trying
to
point
out
in
defense
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
that
i
fear
they
had
the
reasons
without
having
to
refer
to
commerce
between
the
states,
but
for
some
reason
that
i
say,
it
was,
for
the
first
time,
raised
by
the
supreme
court
itself
practically.
it
was
argued
on
motion
for
rehearing,
after
the
decision,
petitioner's
motion
for
rehearing,
then
the
commerce
question
was
argued.
and
the
supreme
court,
as
a
matter
--
it
wasn't
argued,
it
was
presented
in
petition
but
there
was
no
argument.
and
summarily,
the
petition
was
dismissed
by
the
court
and
we
had
the
application
for
a
rehearing.
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
that
might
be
a
--
an
entirely
correct
observation,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
that,
mr.
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
mr.
justice
reed,
the
mandate,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
in
the
record
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
franks
but
the
--
the
effect
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
was
to
sustain
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
i
might
explain
to
you
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
is
correct.
not
--
not
on
in
any
interstate
commerce
theory,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
--
on
this
regularly
employed
theory,
yes.
now,
under
the
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
if
--
when
it
goes
back
from
here,
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
is
--
one
of
the
things
that
puzzled
me
is
to
how
it
might
go
back
to
the
industrial
commission.
if
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
merely
send
it
back
in
a
form
of
the
common
mandate,
which
their
rules
as
far
as
superior
court
is
concerned,
referred
to
as
remittiturs,
then
i
assume
the
commission
would
have
nothing
further
to
do
but
to
reverse
its
own
position,
and
in
effect,
to
pay
this
claim
or
grant
suitable
award
in
this
claim.
that
is
probably
what
would
happen,
yes.
under
the
laws
of
arizona,
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona
is
a
quasi-judicial
body
and
it
constitutes
a
forum
in
which
claims
are
adjudicated
and
claims
cases
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
on
writ
of
certiorari.
that
is
not
true,
however,
in
rate
or
premium
cases,
which
happened
to
be
the
watson
brothers
case
to
which
we
refer.
those
cases
go
by
direct
appeal
and
trial
de
novo
to
the
superior
courts
and
then
to
the
supreme
court
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
watson
brothers
case,
because
in
that
case,
they
had
a
trial
record
and
these
matters
of
how
this
commerce
is
affected
and
the
cost
of
premiums,
if
counsel
please,
was
all
thoroughly
gone
into
in
the
trial
record.
and
i
--
i'm
convinced
that
it
was
actually
the
trial
record
in
the
watson
brothers
case
that
somewhat
influenced
the
court
in
this
case,
it
not
having
an
adequate
record
before
it.
it
must
have
been
where
they
got
the
federal
aspect
that's
from
the
record
of
the
watson
brothers
case
a
prior
case.
mr.
john
f.
franks
that
perhaps
is
true,
your
honor.
i
certainly
was
alert,
obvious
from
the
opinion
and
pointed
out
the
status
of
the
record
before
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
franks
seemingly,
mr.
justice
minton,
yes,
in
this
case.
now,
that
is,
of
course,
one
of
the
arguments
between
counsel
here
where
we
draw
some
fine
lines.
i
have
referred
to
the
statement
of
the
court
where
they
talk
about
duplicate
coverage
in
some
point.
mr.
john
f.
franks
well,
that
could
possibly
be,
your
honor.
i
see
that
it
might.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
f.
franks
if
the
court
please,
if
your
honor
please,
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona
is
the
forum
for
all
processing
of
industrial
claim
even
where
there
is
all
process
in
the
forum.
the
quasi-judicial
body
adjudicates
even
where
there
is
no
insurance.
if
an
employer
fails
to
comply
with
the
act,
if
he
--
if
he
ignores
the
act
and
carries
no
insurance
and
takes
the
risk
of
liability
unto
himself,
the
industrial
commission,
still
upon
claim
being
made,
is
commanded
by
the
law
to
process
that
claim
and
enter
an
award,
which
is
in
effect,
a
judgment
against
the
employer
himself,
there
being
no-insurance
carrier.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
employer,
american
buslines,
carried
a
policy
with
the
state
fund,
but
only
covering
their
employees
at
the
docks
in
phoenix
or
the
office
help
in
phoenix,
not
the
policy,
specifically,
eliminated
the
employer
--
the
employees
in
this
category
because
of
the
watson
brothers
decision
which
said,
“we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
them.”
but
the
claim
was
properly
filed
with
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
there
is
no
argument
about
that.
our
dispute
is
whether
it's
over,
whether
the
state
fund
as
an
insurance
carrier
is
liable
for
the
payment
of
the
benefits
that
might
be
due
to
this
widow
and
child
under
the
arizona
act.
now,
of
course,
we
still
bear
in
mind
that
the
widow
is
fully
protected
under
the
california
act.
and
i
believe
counsel
has
pointed
out
in
footnote
to
his
brief
that
she
did
file
her
claim
in
california.
however,
this
probably
had
been
held
in
abeyance
pending
this
matter,
but
reserved
her
statutory
limitation
rights.
the
claim
was
undoubted
or
apparently
filed.
if
the
court
please,
our
conclusion
is
merely
this,
very
frankly,
we
feel
that
there
were
reasons
for
the
court's
decision
below
resting
in
state
statute.
the
court
should
be
permitted
to
construe
its
state
statutes
and
that
the
federal
question,
which
they
injected
into
this
case
in
their
opinion,
is
probably
secondary
and
that
the
state
should
be
free
to
construe
its
own
acts,
especially,
where
they
have
placed
no
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
thank
you.
