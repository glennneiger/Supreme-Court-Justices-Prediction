are
you
arguing
--
is
your
argument
--
have
to
be
base
on
the
fact
that
they
had
three
offenses
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
sounds
like
you're
seeing
it
as
three
offenses
to
me.
justice
hugo

under
the

doctrine.
justice

black
under
the
blockburger
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if,
it's
all
one
--
if
it's
only
one
attempt,
then
i
--
i
would
suppose
to
(inaudible)
that
refusal
couldn't
make
any
difference
which
time
he
refused
it'd
just
be
one
opinion.
and
if
it's
three
offenses
i
wouldn't
suppose
they
could
try
it
for
failure
to
report
to
the
hospital
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
going
beside
myself
to
say
if
in
the
case
of
this
kind
that
there's
only
offense
and
it's
quite
the
construction
statute.
i
don't
--
i
don't
like
to
see
if
for
the
advocacy
of
the
offense
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
looking
into
6
(j),
it
looks
to
me
like
the
crime
he's
had
under
6
(j)
is
to
find
in
it
,
to
hand
to
me
over
is
clearly
is
a
violation
of
the
order
of
the
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
each
board
has
made
its
own.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
does
the
fact
get
--
they
--
they
provide
some
different
statements
about
it
and
an
order
came
to
the
fact
if
his
crime,
is
in
violating
the
order
of
the
board
to
travel
where
in
this
place
where
the
board's
order
was
given.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
only
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
of
your
armgument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
were
dividing
it
up
into
three
parts.
6
(j)
plainly
defines
the
crime.
it
says
that
if
--
if
he
failed
to
do
this,
he
has
neglected
to
perform
a
duty.
then
section
12
(a)
said
if
a
person
who
is
knowing
to
fail,
neglected
to
perform
a
duty.
that
means
he
failed
to
--
to
follow
the
order
of
the
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
made
it
its
own.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
i
don't
quite
get
and
i
can't
quite
follow
you
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
method
of
arguing
but
i
(voice
overlap)
--
conclusion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
read
the
statute
to
define
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
order
is,
that
they
can
order
him
to
go
and
perform
this
work.
he's
violated
that
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
one
order
as
in
your
viewpoint
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
says
that
he
must
go
and
do
some
work.
he
must
report
and
do
that
work
until
he
leaves
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
whenever
he
violated
he
violated
the
board
through
the
original
order.
it
can't
be
divided
up
by
numbering
the
parts
one,
two,
three
and
four
under
sixth
and
seventh
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
a
witness
is
summoned
in
one
district
to
go
to
another
and
he
failed
to
go,
is
that
a
criminal
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
makes
--
that
--
you
mean
under
the
criminal
contempt
statute,
which
makes
it
a
crime
--
an
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
it
has
been
used
there?
are
there
many
cases
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
what
effect
of
circumstances
can
a
man
commit
a
crime
at
a
place
where
he's
never
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
name
of
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
the
order
contained
two
orders,
what
are
the
two
orders?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
he
fails
to
make
the
first
one,
can
he
be
prosecuted
for
two
offenses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
he
could
be
indicted
for
both
--
for
two
offenses
for
violating
what
you
called
the
two
orders
in
one?
