but
when
he
said
he'd
refused,
he
showed
up
at
the
draft
board
and
said,
â€œi
refuse
to
go
down
there."
and
he
changed
his
mind
and
went
down
there.
could
you
persecute
him
for
the
refusal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
duties
do
you
think
are
involved
in
this
whole
process
for
you
to
understand?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
registrant
gets
the
notice
to
report
to
the
board
for
the
instructions,
and
shows
up,
and
he
says
nothing,
you
tell
the
report
to
kansas
10
days
later
then
he
goes
on
a
motor
trip
as
was
through
15
and
20
towns.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
does
the
venue
lie
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
there's
only
a
single
offense
here
which
is
the
ultimate
failure
to
report
(voice
