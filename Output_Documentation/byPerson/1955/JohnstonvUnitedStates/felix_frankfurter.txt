justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
--
what
actually
happened
when
you
report,
that
johnston,
johnston
showed
up
at
the
board.
what
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
say
--
say
good
morning
and
they
say
good
morning,
what
happens
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
know
--
would
you
know
what
hospital
to
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
go
straight
to
the
hospital,
suppose
he
went
straight
to
the
hospital?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
be
punishable
for
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
repeat
my
question.
are
there
three
offenses
here
or
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
client
or
any
client
of
yours
for
the
judges,
it
is
three
times
he's
stating
that
he
separately
accepted
the
defense
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
now
there's
different
positions
towards
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
--
and
you're
saying
that's
just
one
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
indicted
in
three
separate
counts
at
three
separate
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
covington,
(inaudible)
give
us
the
word
--
what
it
is
it
that
was
indicted
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
a
(inaudible)
charge,
what
is
the
statute
on
which
that
took
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
under
which
you
claim
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
public
claims
unless
you
disagree
that
the
indictment
was
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
says,
"the
same
or
neglect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
cuts
out
something
to
work
and
to
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
do
something
and
refuse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
just
--
they
just
fail
on
what
is
left.
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
you
know
--
you
know
the
government
can
set
out
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
got
all
three
in,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
covington,
i'd
like
to
know
what
is
the
fact
in
deciding
this
case
and
what
i
have
to
decide
in
this
case.
it
seems
they
wanted
to
look
at
the
fact.
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
in
this.
the
materials
for
the
decision
are,
one
is
indictment.
you
could
take
him
by
his
allegations
(inaudible)
two,
the
statute
on
which
the
judge
will
have
to
say
what
is
the
relevant
regulation.
three,
the
motion
to
dismiss
because
of
the
failure
is
displayed.
any
other
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
only
fact
which
we
call
fact
are
the
facts
within
the
framework
of
those
documents
that
are
renewed
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
the
government
makes
an
allegation
that
he
fails
or
neglected
to
do
someting,
which
by
statue,
which
failure
or
neglect
is
made
a
crime,
the
indictment
must
be
valid
(inaudible)
provision
with
reference
to
that
failure
or
neglect
to
satisfy
although
the
trial
may
show
that
the
government
can't
make
good
out
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
disagree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
mean
by
phony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
what
the
government
alleges
is
a
matter
of
law
is
not
what
i'm
challenging
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
alleges
as
an
indictment
in
terms
of
a
statute
which
makes
that
allegation
an
offense
is
obedient
to
the
statute,
although,
the
facts
to
disclose
is
the
fact
that
it
may
not
square
with
the
allegations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
you've
paid
enough
attention
to
what
i've
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
as
i've
said
nothing
can
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
on
the
basis
of
what
i'm
to
decide
with
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
may
judge
and
make
an
allegation
to
satisfy
the
statute
both
as
a
substantive
law
and
the
constitution
as
to
venue
does
not
include
the
hardships
that
they
may
have
completely
misalleged
the
fact
that
subsequently
adjuring
an
important
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
put
in
the
little
word
"only"
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
are
three
parts
and
there
are
three
offenses
here
under
that
document
to
which
you
have
that
are
mentioned
at
the
beginning,
then
i
should
think
it's
open
to
the
government
to
choose
anyone
of
the
three.
so,
that
they
committed
and
violated
all
three,
the
government
didn't
have
to
indict
but
all
three,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
choose
the
one
that
is
most
convenient
for
your
defendant.
the
government
makes
may
choose
anyone
of
the
three
if
they
violated
all
of
the
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
go
beyond
that.
you
must
say,
couldn't
have
occurred
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
this
allegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
if
this
--
this
thing
on
page,
wherever
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
that's
-
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
page
59.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
you
--
in
the
appendix.
that
should
be
his
letter
under
that
order.
it
was
or
rather
it
could
have
been
disobedience
or
failure
to
report
to
the
hospital
work
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
probably
if
they
haven't
got
three
links
and
i've
discovered
the
three
parts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
it's
formation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
they
--
if
this
fellow
had
turned
up
at
the
norristown
hospital,
he
still
would
have
been
guilty
subject
to
indictment
for
the
two
and
trial
on
performance.
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
technically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
be
making
the
most
persuasive
argument
here,
but
it's
the
fruit
of
misconduct,
sporadic
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
government
which
they
did
anyway.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
because
we
didn't
add
to
what
you
were
telling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
it
heard,
what
the
duties
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
of
it
is
to
report
at
norristown.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
trying
to
put
to
you
into
considering
for
me
that
--
that
you
may
violate
these
three
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it's
duty
as
of
the
whole
thing
and
thereby
whose
duty
aid
has
the
duty
to
work
with
at
the
hospital.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
indictment
could
be
a
domestic
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's,
of
course,
(inaudible)
is
disobedient
to
all
or
abuse
then
i
should
think
on
your
own
theory,
the
venue
of
the
offenses,
respectively,
is
the
place
where
the
particular
(inaudible)
has
to
performed
with
which
he
failed
to
perform.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
board
will
just
come
to
ignore
this
--
ignore
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
all
of
the
order
takes
place
there.
but
if
they
make
a
shop
that's
a
constitutional
purpose.
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
requires
a
thing,
(inaudible)
one
opinion
of
the
district
of
columbia.
i
must
through
another
day
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
third
through
the
city
of
boston
including
their
(inaudible)to
make
it
appear
in
all
those
different
places.
and
i
(inaudible)
i
was
told
i
had
to
stay.
i
defied
the
law
and
appear
at
none
of
the
same
places.
i
can
be
indicted
for
offense
at
each
place.
i
can't
be
prosecuted
at
any
one
place
for
all
three
because
the
three
localities
are
on
a
different
venue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
if
he
goes
to
the
board,
obeys
that
far
as
to
the
documents
that's
before
our
attention,
he
doesn't
go
through
that
his
knowledge
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
doesn't
he
turn
up
his
knowledge
on
to
submit
to
the
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
--
wouldn't
that
be
another
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposing
even
though
he
gets
these
instructions
from
the
board
to
go
to
norristown,
and
to
be
there
the
next
monday
at
10
o'clock
at
the
norristown
hospital.
but
he
doesn't
turn
up
at
the
norristown
hospital
the
next
tuesday
at
10
o'clock.
would
that
be
an
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
would
the
offense
be
committed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
wouldn't
be
an
offense
at
norristown
where
they
show
--
show
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
i
suppose
he
--
suppose
he
goes
to
the
board
and
then
i
won't
go
to
norristown
and
i
won't
work.
does
he
commit
one
offense
or
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
trying
to
construe
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
he
--
he
disobeys
like
--
like
a
colloquy
to
do
it,
that's
applied,
if
it
was,
the
offense
for
disobedience
of
what
the
board
tells
him
to
do.
if
the
board
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
tells
him
what
to
do
to
get
the
norristown
and
when
he
gets
to
norristown
to
do
the
work
there
assigned
that
either
he
doesn't
go
to
norristown
at
all,
or
goes
to
norristown
and
he
doesn't
do
the
work
which
he's
assigned,
the
offense
he's
committed,
is
disobeyed
at
the
board
place
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
doesn't
(inaudible)
the
venue
in
every
instance
must
be
at
the
place
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
supposing
where
he
does
come
to
know
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
he
is
that
he
well
may
be
a
very
courteous
man
and
he
says
and
the
board
doesn't
go
(inaudible)
very
well,
i'll
go
to
norristown
to
(inaudible)
what
crime
or
crimes
was
committed
and
where
are
they
or
where
they
may
be
prosecuted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
appear
in
the
indictment,
mr.
imlay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
practically
in
terms
of
particulars
which
fill
out
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
imlay,
since
the
--
to
make
it
sure
that
that
was
enforced,
there
must
have
been
numerous
prosecution
of
this
nature,
namely,
for
disobedience
of
the
order,
am
i
right
out
of
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
numbers,
i
mean,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
offense
numbers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
me
whether
i'm
also
writing
the
impression
that
sometimes
there'd
be
eventually
a
play
in
the
district
where
the
board
is
and
at
some
times
we
play
in
the
district
where
the
reporting
--
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
was
going
to
ask
you
the
basis
on
which
or
whether
there
is
some
generalizing
--
underlying
unity
for
one
or
maybe
one
--
one
venue,
for
laying
in
the
venue
in
one
place
rather
than
the
other.
and
--
you
just
give
them
a
--
a
good
illustration,
the
oklahoma
situation,
i
get
why
you
set
out
from
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
--
are
there
any
decree,
any
pattern
in
respective
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
it's
much
more
important
to
analyze
what
the
crime
is
than
to
bother
about
the
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
what
we're
concerned
with
is
a
constitutional
provision
which
served
the
venue
and
shall
be
laid
in
the
district
wherein
this
crime
shall
have
been
permitted,
though
the
analysis
requires
a
local
invasion
of
the
crime
either
the
doing
of
what
is
forbidden
or
the
not
doing
of
what
we
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
crucial
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
--
the
trouble
here
is
that
the
statute
says,
"it
would
be
safe
to
obey
any
order
with
local
board."
now,
the
order
may
be
to
come
to
the
board
and
he
will
then
tell
you
what
to
do
next
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
order
may
already
uprise
him
what
he
is
to
do.
and
if
that
in
another
district
has
failed
to
turn
up
there,
the
constitution
allowing
congress
to
impose
that
duty
at
a
particular
place,
the
failure
to
do
it
at
that
particular
place
localizes
the
crime
at
the
place
of
omission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
i
suggest
to
you
analyze
what
is
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
concede
the
crime
should
be
and
then
the
rest
is
relatively
easy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
those
cases
where
they'd
be
in
either
one
place
or
the
other
for
continuing
things,
the
chain
may
go
from
one
district
to
another
and,
therefore,
the
venue
is
properly
either
the
first
or
the
third
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
imlay,
may
i
ask
you
whether
in
your
view,
the
indictment
could
have
been
withdrawn
so
that
unmistakably,
the
breach
of
duty
for
the
place
of
the
board,
suppose
the
--
the
drafter
had
said
had
failed
to
perform,
did
knowingly
neglect
to
perform
a
duty
intended
upon
him
by
the
provisions
of
the
said
act
and
that
he
failed
to
repot
to
the
board
for
instruction
when
and
where
the
proceeding
of
such
an
indictment,
is
such
an
indictment
be
valid
under
16
(j)?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
indictment
particularized
on
the
basis
of
--
in
the
appendix
to
which
it
was
probably
called
the
appendix
and
said
report
at
the
hour
and
the
day
named
in
this
order
--
in
the
hour
and
the
day
named
in
this
order
in
your
order
to
report
to
the
local
board
above
at
10
a.m.
on
the
27th
day
of
november,
where
you
will
be
given
instructions
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
employment.
suppose
the
--
the
draftsmen
had
--
had
laid
the
indictment
in
those
particularized
term,
namely,
that
he's
neglected
to
report
to
the
board
in
order
that
--
where
he
would
be
noted
to
receive
their
instructions
to
proceed.
why
wouldn't
that
be
within
the
term
of
the
notice
to
be
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
hasn't
--
then
why
didn't
you
tell
her
to
put
in
this
--
that
he
should
report
to
get
the
hour
and
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
have
reference
--
no,
i
have
reference
to

your
page

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
tell
him
that
the
johnston's

justice
felix

you
are
ordered
to
report
to
the
local
board
named
above
it
at
10
a.m.
on
the
27th
day
of
november
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
1953
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
you
will
be
given
instruction.
i'm
grafting
a
different
kind
of
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
and
laying
the
charge
in
the
very
terms
of
that
paragraph
that
he
didn't
obeyed
that
paragraph,
would
that
be
an
indictment
valid
under
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
does
it
not
turn
them
on
what
the
indictment
alleges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
--
they're
not
to
enter
the
trial
of
fatal
bearing
between
the
crime
that
was
charged
and
the
crime
that's
proven.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
i
suggest
--
wholly
a
part,
i
just
suggest
in
the
inferences
of
clarity
--
of
clarity
and
not
misleading
readers
of
fine
prints
or
mostly
we
don't
read
the
fine
prints
of
that
paragraph
to
be
needed
in
the
future.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
a
good
idea
that
he
must've
had
confronted
within.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
really
is
whether
congress
has
power
to
impose
the
term
of
your
duty
and
what
kind
of
duties
it
may
impose
whether
the
same
board
determines
his
duty
and
certainly
by
making
it
an
offense
not
to
perform
that
duty.
so
the
real
question
is,
they,
congress
made
you
do
something
at
a
place
i
live
--
where
you
live.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
imlay,
if
you
make
this
--
if
you
make
this
a
little
concrete,
that
the
legal
problem
with
the
virtue
more
clearly,
the
board
said
that
you
cast
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
pennsylvania
which
is
the
western
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
told
to
report
there
on
the
27th
of
november.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
told
him,
you
be
as
narrative
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
(inaudible)
of
pennsylvania.
you
reported
(inaudible)
which
is
in
the
east,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
crime,
(a),
whether
if
congress
did
make
it
as
a
crime
for
him
not
to
turn
up
in
(inaudible)
laid
an
offense
and
whether
constitutionally
congress
could
make
it
an
offense.
well
somebody
with
an
authority
and
new
cast
to
tell
a
registrant,
you
should
turn
up
--
turn
up
authority.
i
do
not
understand
that
the
colloquy
of
--
contend
the
constitution
if
the
congress
couldn't
make
that
an
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
they
could
make
it
an
offense
at
least
to
(inaudible)
and
pass
it
to
an
important
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
city
of
washington.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
gets
down
the
question
of
construction
whether
the
statute
makes
it
an
offense,
not
to
be
at
a
particular
place,
different
from
the
place
of
which
the
order
of
the
authority
told
you
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
hadn't
turned
up
that
new
--
new
castle
on
the
27th
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
--
it
was
you
who
say
the
venue
would
have
to
be
laid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
congress
pass
a
statute,
they
said
explicitly
that
a
registrant
who
--
after
he
report
to
the
board
shall
not
go
to
the
place
where
the
board
held
him
to
report,
he's
triable
at
the
place
where
he's
suppose
to
report.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
not
opposing
the
statute
as
they
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know
all
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
court
has
held
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
passed
a
statute
to
say
that
a
fellow
who
wants
to
stay
in
his
status
and
not
to
come
here
and
maybe
guilty
of
an
offense
for
not
coming
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
offense
with
the
blackmar
case
was
--
was
the
effect
of
not
reporting
at
a
place
where
mr.
blackmar
said,
"i
don't
want
to
go
there.
(inaudible)
is
a
much
more
--
it's
a
(inaudible)
place
for
me
to
spend
my
time."
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
he
should
have
been
prosecuted
and
pairing
by
some
united
states
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
offense,
what
congress
had,
what
kind
of
a
statute,
if
it
says,
he
should
report
at
the
place
to
which
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
directs
him
to
be,
then,
his
duty
is
to
be
on
that
place,
an
omission
to
be
there
is
an
offensive
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
like
--
i
should
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
to
you
mr.
covington,
that
this
courtesy
is
not
usually
an
argument.
