versus

and

versus

a.
patteson.
mr.
imlay,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
notice
in
the
--
in
the
form,
it
says
not
to
report
but
to
proceed,
it's
his
failure
to
report
to
the
hour
and
on
the
day
named
in
this
order
or
to
proceed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
place
of
employment
pursuant
to
instructions
or
to
remain
in
this
employment,
specified
time
will
constitute
a
violation
of
the
law
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
i'm
telling
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
doesn't
tell
him
that
his
--
it
will
be
a
violation
of
the
law
for
him
not
to
report.
it
says,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
for
him
not
to
proceed,
doesn't
it
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
there
be
any
hardship
on
the
government
to
prosecute
this
man
in
the
place
where
the
order
was
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
generally
speaking,
would
--
would
that
cast
any
additional
burden
on
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
the
other
hand,
suppose
a
draftee
lived
in
florida
and
he
was
sent
to
the
state
of
oregon
to
work,
would
it
pass
any
great
burden
on
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
was
done
in
one
of
these
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
imlay,
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
on
the
line
of
justice
frankfurter's
questions.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
in
no
case
has
there
been
a
prosecution
for
such
as
this,
such
as
these
cases
in
the
place
where
the
local
board
gave
the
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
searched
to
--
to
see?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
imlay,
if
i
may
advert
once
more
to
this
document
in
your
appendix,
remember
i
asked
you
a
little
while
ago
about
the
clause
in
there
which
says
"or
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
employment
pursuant
to
instructions."
and
as
i
recall
it,
you
told
me
that
that
was
merely
layman's
language
informing
the
registrant
what
he
was
to
do
but
wasn't
the
official
part
of
the
document.
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
official
threats
of
the
document
was
contained
in
what
appears
at
the
top
of
it,
order
to
report
for
civilian
work.
that
is
right,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
if
this
is
the
order
to
report
for
civilian
work.
why
would
you
then
prosecute
the
man,
under
your
theory,
in
the
place
where
the
board
was
sitting
and
not
where
the
work
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
--
if
you
have
two
orders
contained
in
this
document
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
violation
of
either
of
which
is
--
is
an
offense.
what
is
there
in
the
law
that
says
that
one
of
those
offenses
is
committed
at
the
--
at
the
place
of
the
--
of
the
board
and
the
other,
some
other
place
out
of
the
district?
now,
how
--
how
can
we
break
that
up
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
let's
just
read
these
two
sections
again.
now,
you
said
that
the
language
or
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
employment
pursuant
to
instructions
was
layman's
language
because
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
--
of
the
order
and
was
in
the
nature
of
instructions.
but
look
at
the
order
itself,
it
says,
you
are
ordered
to
report
to
the
local
board
named
above
at
10
a.m.
on
the
27th
of
november,
1953,
where
you
will
be
given
instructions
to
proceed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
place
of
employment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
it
doesn't
say
to
--
you'll
be
given
instructions
to
report
to
the
place
of
employment
and
says
you'll
be
giving
--
given
instructions
to
proceed,
and
if
he
doesn't
proceed,
i
suppose,
heâ€˜s
in
violation
of
the
order,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
the
things
i
can't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
get.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
i
--
i
understand
that
this
is
his
--
of
--
his
official
order.
now,
where
in
this
order
does
it
--
does
it
order
him
to
report
to
his
place
of
employment?
where
does
it
do
more
than
order
him
to
proceed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
believe
that
that
is
true
even
though
it
says
below,
failure
to
report
at
the
hour
and
on
the
day
named
in
this
order
which
means
at
the
board
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
the
employment
pursuant
to
instructions
or
to
remain
in
this
employment,
the
specified
time,
will
constitute
a
violation
of
the
universal
military
training
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
was
in
--
if
he
was
in
hawaii
when
he
received
the
--
this
order
that's
represented
by
the
statute
in
your
appendix
and
he
failed
to
come
to
new
castle,
he'd
be
prosecuted
in
new
castle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
if
the
order
--
if
the
order
directed
him
to
--
to
report
for
work
in
hawaii
and
he
didn't
go
back
to
hawaii
to
report,
you
prosecute
him
in
hawaii.
that's
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
got
one
of
those
cases
here
though,
kansas
and
oklahoma
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
kansas
to
oklahoma
and
i
guess
he
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
it
that
far
that
you
could
do
at
any
place
you
want
under
your
theory,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
imlay,
i
--
i
understood
you
earlier
in
your
argument
to
say
that
there
were
three
orders.
one,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
to
report
to
the
board,
the
other
was
to
report
to
his
place
of
employment,
then
the
third,
was
to
remain
there
for
24
months.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
let's
say
--
let's
say
that
he
did
report
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
place
of
employment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
having
first
reported
to
the
board.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
didn't
stay
the
24
months.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
could
prosecute
him
for
not
staying
for
24
months?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
could
also
prosecute
him
if
he
didn't
report
to
the
place
of
employment,
could
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
you
have
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
if
he
didn't
report
to
his
place
of
employment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
he
committed
one
crime
or
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he's
committed
more
than
one
crime
if
he
doesn't
report
to
the
place
of
employment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
committed
that
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
he's
committed
one
crime
under
any
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
he
is
to
report
to
the
board
first
or
to
report
to
his
place
of
employment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
one
crime,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
then
why
shouldn't
it
have
one
venue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.

justice
earl
warren

covington.
