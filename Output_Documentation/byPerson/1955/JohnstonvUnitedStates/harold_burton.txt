it
didn't
make
any
difference
that
what
time
he
started
to
proceed
to
this
is
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
he
wouldn't
know
then
when
he
had
violated
this
order
to
--
to
proceed
and
until
the
time
came
for
him
to
arrive
at
the
other
end.
justice
harold
burton
but
even
though
he
refuses
to
proceed
he
may
make
up
his
mind
--
justice

and
change
his
mind

justice

if
he
changed
his
mind
that

at

anytime
to
go?
justice

well,
in
--
in
6
(j),
you
were
reading

a
moment
ago.

6
(j)
you
were
reading
it
from
a
moment

is
that
because
they
regarded
military
service
as
beginning
of
that
point
whereas
here
is
not
military
service
and
doesn't
begin
because
of
the
work?
justice
harold
burton
i
suppose
that
the
pay
begins
then,
not
when
it
gets
to
the
other
end
whereas
here
that
whenever
he
gets
there

justice

gets
the
transportation.
justice
harold

but
doesn't
--
i
--
i'm
unable
to
do
a
way
with
6
(j)
as
you
have.
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
now,
in
these
cases,
did
they
get
that
far?
that
he'd
reported
to
the
board
and
then
did
they
give
him
the
hour
and
date
in
which
he
was
to
be
at
the
hospital?
