mr.
carl
h.
imlay
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
covington
has
said
that
each
of
the
registrants
and
each
of
these
three
cases
was
finally
classified,
(inaudible)
there's
no
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
classification
and
each
was
given
a
final
type
physical
examination
and
found
eligible
under
section
6
(j)
of
the
universal
of
military
training
and
service
act
for
assignment
to
work
at
national
importance.
in
each
case,
each
registrant
was
assigned
to
work
in
a
state
hospital
lying
outside
of
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
local
board
was
located.
it's
admitted,
i
believe,
that
that
order
sent
by
the
local
board
to
the
registrant
in
each
case
was
violated
in
some
particular.
we
have
mr.
covington
referred
the
court's
attention
to
page
56
of
the
government's
brief
where
we've
set
forth
that
order.
that
order
really
is
the
origin
of
the
duties
about
which
there's
a
conflict
of
opinion
here.
i
think
that
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
left,
i'll
just
point
out
a
--a
few
things
about
this
particular
order.
it's
captioned
in
order
to
report
for
civilian
work
of
course.
it's
sent
to
the
registrant
and
was
in
each
of
these
three
cases
at
his
mailing
address,
which
might
be
anywhere.
it
isn't
related
especially
to
his
residence
or
his
home
or
any
fixed
place.
the
registrant
is
notified
of
his
assignment.
in
the
session
tomorrow,
i'll
explain
a
little
more
about
the
procedure
surrounding
that
the
assignment.
and
then,
the
order
really
breaks
down
into
two
different
orders.
the
first
of
these
is
your
order
to
report
the
local
board
and
the
time
for
reporting
at
the
local
board
is
set
forth
in
this
order.
now
this,
the
registrant
gets
this
--
this
order
10
days
ahead
of
time
so
he's
well
advised
that
--
of
the
situation
when
he
gets
this
order
form.
then
you're
ordered
to
report
to
the
local
board
where
you
will
be
given
instructions
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
employment.
the
instructions
to
proceed
do
not
mean
the
instructions
as
to
how
he
has
to
make
the
trip,
when,
what
mode
of
conveyance.
the
instructions
actually
given
these
registrants
when
they
come
to
the
local
board
are
instructions
as
to
the
precise
time
at
which
they're
to
report
the
place
of
employment
and
the
person
usually
to
whom
they
are
to
report.
in
some
instances
where
the
--
where
it
--it
would
work
a
hardship
on
the
registrant
to
come
to
the
local
board,
in
fact,
in
some
instances
the
registrant
is
instructed
to
report
straight
to
the
place
of
employment
and
by
mail
usually
those
are
cases
where
the
local
board
is
some
distance
removed
from
where
the
registrant
happens
to
be
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
they
did.
they
handed
him
instructions
in
each
case
telling
him,
i
believe,
to
whom
to
report
and
what
time.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
this
indictment
--
i
might
say
this
--
these
--
these
cases
were
disposed
off
by
way
of
sort
of
a
speaking
demurrer
on
--
and
that
did
and
some
of
the
background
facts
were
inquired
into
and
on
that
basis
i've
referred
the
court's
attention
to
the
actual
order
here.
we
--
we
--
we've
dealt
with
just
more
than
the
face
of
the
act
itself
and
the
terms
of
the
indictment
here.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
think
we
may,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
second
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
instant
cases
involved
the
question
of
whether
venue
for
the
crime
of
failing
to
report
for
work
of
national
importance
lies
in
the
judicial
district
of
the
local
board
which
issued
the
order,
commanding
that
the
registrant,
the
conscientious
objector
registrants
report
to
the
work
or
whether
venue
for
this
crime
of
failing
to
report
lies
in
the
judicial
district
for
the
registrant
who
was
obligated
to
report
and
do
the
work.
now,
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
sitting,
i'd
referred
the
court
to
the
order
to
report
form
which
was
to
send
each
of
these
registrants
and
which
defines
the
duties,
the
obligations
of
each
of
the
registrants
in
these
cases.
that
order
appears
on
page
56
of
the
government's
brief.
now,
i
had
explained
that
this
form
notifies
the
registrant,
the
conscientious
objector
registrant
of
his
assignment
to
work
of
national
importance
and
each
of
these
cases
that
work
lay
outside
of
the
judicial
district
in
which
his
local
board
was
located.
i
also
referred
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
literal
terms,
this
order
is
comprised
really
of
two
orders.
the
first
order
compels
the
--
the
registrant
to
report
to
his
local
board
at
a
specific
time
where
he
would
be
given
instructions
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
employment.
i
had
explained
that
on
reporting
to
the
local
board
the
registrant
was
notified,
the
registrant
already
had
his
work
assignment.
he
--
he
had
--
was
notified
10
--
10
days
before
the
time
for
reporting
for
the
local
board
of
his
specific
work
assignment.
but
in
order
to
brief
him
and
--
and
ensure
that
he
would
understand
in
every
particular,
the
nature
of
his
duty,
he
--
he
was
ordered
to
come
to
the
local
board
and
--
in
this
cases
while
the
registrant
has
given
a
--
usually
a
written
instruction
sheet
telling
him
the
precise
person
to
whom
to
report
at
the
destination,
at
the
--
in
this
case
a
--
a
state
hospital
was
the
work
of
national
importance
assigned
to
each
of
these
registrants.
he
was
also
given
the
hour,
the
time
for
reporting
at
the
place
of
employment.
that
might
be
anywhere
from
a
few
hours
to
several
days,
maybe
a
--
a
couple
of
weeks
away
from
the
time
when
he
reported
to
the
local
board.
now,
that
is
the
first
order
to
report
to
the
local
board,
the
second
order
on
this
form.
you
are
ordered
to
report
for
employment,
pursuant
to
the
instructions
of
the
local
board
to
remain
in
employment
for
24
consecutive
months
until
such
time
as
you
are
released
or
transferred
by
proper
authority.
this
order,
in
other
words,
has
a
two-fold
purpose
to
get
him
to
the
local
board
in
the
first
instance
and
in
the
second
instance
to
get
him
to
his
place
of
employment
at
--
at
the
proper
time.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
if
he
didn't
report
to
the
local
board,
mr.
justice
clark,
the
prosecution
would
lie
in
the
judicial
district
to
the
local
board.
that
was
true
under
the
world
war
ii
regulations
where
many
of
the
orders
sent
to
the
registrants
during
that
world
war
ii
period,
just
required
that
they
report
to
the
local
board
at
that
time,
as
i
will
explain
a
little
later,
the
reporting
to
the
local
board
was
the
first
step
in
the
trip
to
the
public
service
camp.
reporting
to
the
local
board
now
is
not
for
transportation
to
a
camp
or
for
delivery
to
a
camp,
it's
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
registrant
a
--
a
more
detail
explanation
of
what
his
--
the
procedure
he
should
follow
in
reporting
to
his
place
of
work.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
think
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
there
--
there
are
probably
three.
now,
i
might
say
this,
the
order
is
couched
as
two
orders.
but
i
think
the
--
the
registrant
is
obligated
to
report
to
his
local
board,
one.
two,
he
is
obligated
to
report
to
the
--
to
the
--
work
assignment
which,
of
course,
is
usually
some
distance
away.
there
is
a
policy
at
the
selective
service
system,
not
to
--
not
to
assign
this
conscientious
objectors'
employment
in
the
local
of
their
residence
but
to
send
them
away.
they
have
a
policy
to
usually
assign
the
--
the
conscientious
objector
to
some
work
assignment,
maybe,
50
or
more
miles
away
from
the
area
of
his
residence
which
is
usually,
but
not
inevitably,
in
the
locality
of
the
local
board.
the
second
obligation
that
he
has
is
a
report
from
employment
and
relay
the
third
which
is
comprise
in
this
second
order
is
to
remain
in
employment
for
24
consecutive
months
or
until
sooner
relieved
by
the
selective
service
of
officers.
in
other
words,
this
--
this
order
follows
him
and
--
and
exist
as
a
--
as
an
obligation
for
the
whole
term
of
his
national
--
his
work
of
national
importance.
i
will
--
this
is
far
different
system
than
obtained
during
the
world
war
ii,
which
i'll
get
to
that
in
just
a
few
moments.
so,
in
other
words,
the
first
order
obligates
him
to
report
at
one
place,
the
second
order
obligates
him
to
report
at
another.
now,
this
has,
in
other
words,
a
two-fold
thrust.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
that
language,
it
has
probably
been
relied
on
by
the
registrants.
this
is
an
explanatory
paragraph
which
is
supposed
to
tell
the
registrant
in
--
in
simple
language
what
his
obligations
are.
now
the
--
this
--
this
language,
of
course,
might
be
susceptible
of
a
--
of
such
a
construction
as
the
registrants
have
--
have
put
on
it
if
--
if
for
anything
more
than
a
simple
explanation.
now,
of
course,
there
is
always
a
duty
to
proceed
whenever
you
are
ordered
to
go
from
one
place
to
another.
but
we
submit,
and
i
think
that
an
explanation
of
the
--
of
the
present
procedures
will
show
that
the
only
fixed
duty
is
to
report
at
the
place
of
work.
there's
always
a
subsidiary
duty
to
proceed
whenever
you're
--
you're
compelled
to
go
from
one
place
to
another.
a
court
subpoena,
for
instance,
who
obligates
the
person
to
whom
the
subpoena
is
directed
to
proceed,
that's
the
only
way
that,
of
course,
that
he
has
of
getting
to
the
place
where
his
obligation
or
his
duty
lies.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
now,
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
this
was
not,
of
course,
intended
as
a
technical
construction
of
the
--
of
the
regulations.
it
was
intended
--
it's
--
it's
layman's
language
so
to
speak.
it
--
it
explains
to
the
registrant
that
he
is
to
--
to
go
forward
perhaps
but
i
don't
think
that
it
was
intended
to
explain
to
him
the
--
the
technical,
legal
consequences
of
--
of
the
failure
to
--
to
report
at
the
place
of
work.
against
this
language
in
this
instruction,
of
course,
is
the
--
the
title
of
this
order
which
is
an
order
to
report
for
civilian
work,
and
also,
the
second
order,
you
are
ordered
to
report
for
employment,
the
registrant
is
forewarned
that
--
that
he
is
ordered
to
report
for
employment
and
we
submit
that
that
--
it
tells
him
in
--
in
precise
language
what
his
duties
are.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it's
a
criminal
contempt
of
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
might
just
say
this
that
one
of
the
landmark
cases
in
this
--
in
this
field
of
--
in
--
in
this
--
that
concerning
this
problem
of
where
venue
of
a
crime
of
omission
lies
is
the
case
of
regina
versus
milner,
an
english
case
cited
by
the
registrants
in
their
brief
and
also
cited
in
this
court's
anderson
opinion
and
frequently
cited
for
the
proposition
that
where
a
duty
to
--
where
the
crime
consist
of
a
failure
to
act,
then
here
lies
where
the
failure
occurred
regardless
of
where
the
person,
the
violator
happened
to
be
when
the
crime
was
committed.
now,
going
back
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
regina
versus
milner
concerned
a
--
one
who
--
a
defendant
who
was
declared
of
bankrupt
and
a
--
an
english
court
in
one
county
served
notice
on
this
defendant
to
surrender
himself
to
the
court
in
that
county.
the
notice
was
sent
to
a
--
a
neighboring
county
where
he
was
then
located
and
where
he
lived.
he
failed
to
appear
at
the
appointed
hour
of
the
court
and
was
indicted
for
failing
to
appear
at
the
court
at
the
appointed
hour.
the
english
court
held
at
the
place
where
this
offense
was
committed,
if
it
was
committed
at
all,
was
the
county
in
which
the
court
was
located.
the
court
said,
assuming
the
facts
to
be
as
alleged,
as
soon
as
three
o'clock
came
and
the
prisoner
did
not
surrender
at
birmingham,
he
committed
the
offense
there.
now,
i
think,
this
might
be
said
to
be
the
common
law
or
the
--
the
traditional
approach
to
this
problem,
of
course,
where
we
have
a
specific
venue
provision
on
the
subject
of
contempt
now.
but
the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
in
these
particular
cases,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would
work
a
hardship
from
the
point
of
view
of
convenience.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
don't
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
--
it
would
cast
a
burden
there.
in
most
cases,
your
honor,
i
might
explain
this.
there
is
a
policy
of
the
selective
service
system,
not
to
send
these
conscientious
objectors
out
of
their
own
state.
much
has
been
said
about
the
possibility
of
sending
them
to
hawaii
or
alaska.
there
is
a
policy
not
to
send
them
out
of
their
own
state.
now
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
was
done
in
one
of
these
cases.
i
might
explain
that
too,
your
honor.
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
a
constitutional
provision
requiring
that
anyone
going
to
work
for
the
state,
sign
a
loyalty
oath
which
includes
an
--
a
--
oath
to
bear
arms
for
the
state
of
oklahoma.
now,
many
of
these
registrants,
especially
where
they
--
they
don't
select
their
own
employment
which
they're
entitled
to
under
present
regulations
are
assigned
to
state
hospitals
which
presently
have
a
great
need
for
--
for
personnel.
in
oklahoma,
it
would
be
impossible,
i
would
say,
but
--
now
too
much
exaggeration
to
assignment
of
these
men
to
--
to
a
state
hospital
because
he
couldn't
take
that
oath.
so,
in
--
in
the
case
of
a
--
of
patteson,
he
was
assigned
to
hospital
work
in
the
state
of
kansas.
and
that
is
what
compelled
into
--
go
from
the
district
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
to
the
--
to
the
district
of
kansas.
the
other
case,
cases
involved
the
district
--to
district
assignments
and
that
is
probably
more
frequent,
and
that's
probably
the
real
--
the
most
lively
problem
involved
because
some
of
the
states,
of
course,
which
have
more
than
one
district,
this
problem
will
frequently
arise.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
think
there
are
quite
a
few,
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
right
that's
because
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
the
--
the
--
i
think
in
those
cases
where
the
registrant
fails
to
do
a
duty
at
the
local
board
where
he
fails
to
send
it
in
his
classification
questionnaire,
where
he
fails
to
keep
the
local
board
notified
of
his
current
mailing
address
and
where
he
fails
to
do
any
act
which
is
required
to
be
done
at
the
local
board,
i
think
it's
--
it's
wholly
consistent
with
our
position
to
prosecute
him
for
that
omission,
where
the
omission
occurred
that
is
in
the
judicial
district
where
the
local
board
is
located.
however,
this
order
in
our
position
is
that
where
the
duty
is
to
go
else
--
to
--
is
to
do
something
elsewhere,
in
this
case
to
report
to
an
employer
elsewhere
why
the
omission
must
occur
where
the
duty,
where
the
act
is
--
is
compelled
be
done.
it
doesn't
arise
where
the
local
board
is
because
the
local
board
issued
the
order
there
or
because
the
--
the
registrant
happens
to
be
there
in
the
area
of
the
local
board
at
the
time,
the
--
the
zero
hour
came
and
he
didn't
appear
for
his
work
assignment,
we
submit
and
i
--
i
will
get
to
those
cases
later
that
this
does,
this
crime
does
come
within
the
general
role
that
the
--
where
the
--
where
the
crime
consist
of
an
omission
to
act
why
it's
committed
where
the
permission
occurs.

that's
quite

mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.

mr.

mr.

mr.

imlay
the
interest
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
know
of
none,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i've
talked
extensively
with
the
selective
service
officers
and
i
know
of
no
such
case.
the
--
i
--
i
know
of
no
such
--
no
case
involving
a
disobedience
of
an
order
to
proceed
or
--
or
any
case
that
are
founded
on
the
theory
that
the
registrant
didn't
set
out
on
the
journey
to
the
place
of
employment
which
is
really
the
theory
of
the
registrants
here.
the
section
6
(j)
of
the
act,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
referred
to,
provides
that
any
person
who
knowingly
fails
or
neglects
to
obey
any
such
order,
any
such
order
from
his
local
board,
meaning
an
order
which
is
--
which
would
compel
him
to
perform
civilian
work
from
his
local
board
shall
be
deemed
for
the
purposes
of
section
12
of
this
title
to
have
knowingly
failed
or
neglected
to
perform
a
duty
required
of
him
under
this
title.
now,
obviously,
the
--
the
crime
defined
by
the
act
is
a
failure
or
neglect
to
do
a
duty
and
that
comes
to
the
question
of
just
what
was
the
duty
here.
now,
of
course,
our
contention
is
the
duty,
after
reporting
at
the
local
board
in
partial
compliance
with
this
order,
is
to
--
to
report
for
employment.
now,
the
registrants
advanced
the
theory
in
--
in
on
this
theory,
they're
somewhat
sustained
by
the
patteson
opinion
that
there
is
a
--
that
this
form
and
the
regulations
in
the
act
obligate
the
registrant
after
receiving
his
order
to
report
to
proceed
from
the
area
of
the
local
board
to
setout
on
the
trip
to
the
place
of
employment.
they
--
by
shifting
the
obligation
to
the
travel
duty
instead
of
the
duty
to
report,
they
attempt
to
shift
the
venue
back
to
the
area
of
the
local
board.
however,
the
patteson
opinion
deems
that
the
duty
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
employment
was
violated
in
each
of
these
cases
when
the
registrant
walked
into
the
local
board
at
the
time
he
was
ordered
to
report
to
the
local
board
and
made
some
statement.
i
might
say
that
some
of
the
statements
that
were
made
to
the
local
board,
well
some
--
very
frequently,
some
of
the
statements
that
are
made
are
equivocal
at
best.
but
in
this
case,
it's
stipulated
that
the
registrant
walked
in
and
tell
the
local
board
that
--
that
he
couldn't
accept
the
assignment.
the
patteson
opinion
deemed
that
that
was
a
crime
that
that
refusal
then
and
there
was
the
--
the
basis
of
the
criminal
act.
the
registrants
concede,
however,
that
this
statement
really
a
future
intent
was
just
mere
evidence
of
such
refusal
that
it
wasn't
the
--
the
crime
but
mere
evidence
of
--
of
an
implied
refusal
to
go
forward.
or
at
least,
that's
our
interpretation.
i
might
say
that
in
fairness
to
the
registrants
in
a
reply
brief
--
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
10,
they
state
that
--
the
stated
refusal
of
the
registrant
confined
with
failure
to
proceed
constitutes
the
offense.
so,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
--
to
the
regulations
in
time
i
have
left
and
just
make
a
brief
explanation
of
--
of
what
the
registrant
is
obligated
to
do
under
present
procedures.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
that's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
that
--
that
epitomizes
the
problem,
i
believe.
the
--
very
frequently,
these
registrants
are
given
10
days
or
two
weeks
between
the
time
that
they
go
to
the
local
board
and
the
time
they're
obligated
to
go
to
the
work.
very
frequently,
they
go
to
some
other
judicial
district.
they
might
formulate
the
scheme
not
to
report
to
work
in
that
other
judicial
district.
that
might
be
--
under
the
theory
of
the
registrant,
that
would
be
the
locality
where
they
refuse
to
proceed
or
go
forward.
that,
i
think,
illustrates
why
the
place
of
omission
to
report
really
is
the
--
should
be
the
place
where
venue
should
lie.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
only
--
only
in
those
instances
where
he
didn't
comply
with
the
first
order
on
the
order
form
and
didn't
report
to
the
local
board.
if
he
did
report
as
these
registrants
did
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
the
only
crime
that
we
can
charge
him
with,
in
our
estimation,
is
--
is
failing
to
report
to
the
place
of
employment.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
we
could
bound
any
charge,
any
registrant
with
--
with
not
reporting
to
the
local
board
--
if
he
reports
to
the
local
board,
no
matter
whether
he
--
he
accepts
the
instructions
or
whether
he
rejects
them,
if
he
reports
to
the
local
board,
he
satisfied
the
first
obligation.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
do
you
have
reference
to
the
patteson
indictment,
mr.
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
think
it
would.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
think
it
would.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
there
may
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
the
indictments
in
each
case
really
charge
a
--
a
neglect
and
failure
to
report
at
the
place
of
work.
i
think
they
can
--
they
all
fairly
state
that
in
each
case.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
that
might
be
a
--
an
intricate
idea,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
a
lot
of
these
registrants
when
they're
ordered
to
report
to
the
local
board
are
not
well
advised
as
to
the
purpose
of
reporting.
i
think
that
was
really
the
reason.
under
the
world
war
ii
system,
when
the
registrant
reported
to
the
local
board,
it
was
not
to
receive
instructions
as
to
what
time
and
to
whom
he
should
report
at
the
destination.
it
was
for
immediate
transportation
to
the
place
of
employment.
at
that
time,
the
--
the
registrant
was
delivered
to
the
place
of
employment.
the
--
the
time
at
departure
was
set
by
the
--
by
the
selective
service
system,
the
mode
of
conveyance.
today,
after
the
--
the
registrant
reports
to
the
local
board,
he's
on
his
own
so
to
speak.
he's
given,
perhaps,
several
days
in
which
to
make
the
trip.
sometimes
he
might
go
by
train
or
by
bus.
he
might
go
by
his
own
private
conveyance.
he
sets
the
time
of
departure.
he
is
in
--
taken
down
to
a
--
or
constructively
delivered
to
a
railroad
station
and
told
to
depart
at
such
and
such
a
time
so,
the
--
there
--
there's
really
no
fixed
duty
to
make
the
trip
as
under
current
regulation
as
was
contended
for
by
the
registrants.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
think
there
--
there
are
several
circumstances,
mr.
justice
black.
for
instance,
failure
to
file
a
tax
return
is
a
failure
committed
where
the
--
the
collector's
office
is
located
rather
than
where
the
accused
happens
to
be
when
the
omission
to
act
occurs.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
the
--
i
think
the
--
the
tax
case,
the
commerford
case
of
the
second
circuit
is
--
is
followed
on
that
point.
certiorari
was
denied.
we've
cited
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
commerford,
united
states
versus
commerford,
c-o-m-m-e-r-f-o-r-d,
64
f.2d
28.
that's
the
second
circuit
case.
there
are
cases
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
yes,
mr
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
right.
i
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
there
are
many
instances
of
that.
this
court
had
the
--
the
case
of
rumely
versus
mccarthy
cited
at
our
brief
on
page
46.
in
that
case,
a
new
york
defendant
was
charged
with
failing,
neglecting
and
omitting
to
report
enemy
property
and
credits
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
with
the
alien
property
custodian
in
the
district
of
columbia.
for
all
we
know,
rumely
had
never
been
to
the
district
of
columbia.
however,
by
failing
to
do
a
duty
in
the
district
of
columbia,
he
had
committed
--
that
this
court
held
that
he
had
committed
the
--
the
crime
of
omission
in
the
district
of
columbia.
a
similar
result
was
reached
in
united
states
versus
lombardo,
also
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
47,
where
a
defendant
and
this
is
a
much
more
--
a
much
more
exaggerated
example
than
any
other,
i
believe.
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
a
--
a
defendant
in
the
western
district
of
washington
who
failed
to
file
--
file
certain
reports
under
the
white-slave
traffic
act
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
properly
triable
in
the
district
of
columbia,
another
crime
of
omission
or
failure
to
act
imposed
by
congress.
the
new
york
central
case
cited
at
our
brief
on
page
47,
involved
a
willfully
failing
to
file
rate
and
charged
schedules
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
--
in
washington
d.c.
the
case
was
properly
triable
in
washington
d.c.
rather
than
in
new
york
of
failure
to
support
inference.
frequently,
the
state
courts
are
called
on
to
decide
where
the
obligation
to
support
inference
lies.
does
it
lie
where
the
defendant
is
located
in
one
county
or
does
it
lie
where
the
inference
are
in
another
county?
the
obligation,
the
courts
have
held
in
state
versus
peabody,
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
the
obligation
lies
where
the
inference
are
located,
not
where
the
defendant
happens
to
be
situated
when
the
--
when
the
time
for
performance
comes
around.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
right.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
didn't
want
to
confound
that
by
--
by
saying
that
the
caption
on
the
--
on
the
order,
order
to
report
for
civilian
work,
is
a
complete
description
of
this
document.
this
document
is
--
it
incorporates
really
two
basic
orders
which
could
have
been
put
forward
--
put
forth
in
a
--
in
two
--
two
different
documents.
the
first
order
is
to
report
to
the
local
board,
the
second
order
is
to
report
for
employment.
i
think
that
this
is
a
--
this
--
the
obligation
under
this
order
begins
in
the
locality
of
the
local
board
but
after
--
after
partial
compliance
with
the
first
order,
i
believe
that
the
--
the
--
then
the
obligation
under
this
order
shifts
to
the
place
of
employment
and
when
the
--
after
the
registrant
has
been
given
his
instructions
while
this
order
then
compels
him
to
go
to
the
place
of
work.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
he
goes
there
and
starts
his
job,
his
job
of
national
importance
which
he
is
to
undertake
and
hold
for
24
months,
if
he
leaves
the
--
the
job
anytime
during
that
24
months,
then
you
have
a
violation
of
this
self
--
same
order.
under
the
world
war
ii
regulations,
why
--
when
a
man
went
down
and
--
to
the
train
depot
and
got
on
the
train
under
government
auspices,
when
the
trip
began,
he
was
transferred
to
another
authority
and
the
local
board's
obligation
was
--
was
discharged
as
to
him.
then
he
became
--
when
the
trip
commenced
an
assignee
of
the
camp
which
was
the
place
of
destination
under
the
public
work
camp
program
but
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
the
--
the
statute
punishes
a
failure
to
--
to
obey
an
order.
now,
here
we
have
two
orders.
if
the
man
does
--
if
the
conscientious
objector
does
not
report
to
the
local
board
in
compliance
with
the
first
order,
he
has
committed
one
crime
which
is
triable
in
the
judicial
district
of
the
local
board,
because
there,
the
obligation
was
set
and
there
the
omission
occurred.
however,
after
--
if
he
does
obey
this
first
order
in
part
compliance
with
this
--
with
this
order
form,
then
the
obligation
imposed
on
him
shifts
to
the
place
of
employment,
and
there,
under
6
(j)
of
the
act,
if
he
doesn't
appear
of
--
the
failure
occurs
in
--
at
the
place
of
work.
now,
that
is
the
--
in
other
words,
this
is
--
it
might
be
considered
a
list
of
obligations
rather
than
one
order
and
any
--
a
failure
of
--
at
any
point
is
--
is
--
it
can
be
prosecuted
where
the
failure
occurs.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
he
isn't,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
the
--the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
the
first
order
here
where
you
will
be
given
instructions
to
proceed
to
the
place
of
employment
--
employment,
means
that
he
will
be
given
certain
instructions
on
how
he
is
to
proceed
meaning
what
procedures
he's
to
follow.
the
selective
service
does
not
provide
his
transportation
except
where
it's
necessary.
they
have
no
funds
to
do
so.
they
don't
appoint
the
time
when
he
is
to
undertake
the
trip.
in
other
words,
the
word
"proceed"
doesn't
mean
travel
or
--
or
when
he
is
to
start
the
trip.
it
means
--
and
--
and
in
literal
application,
what
happens
is
that
when
he
comes
in,
he's
given
a
very
short
little
instruction
sheet,
usually,
telling
what
person
to
whom
he's
to
--
to
report
at
the
destination
and
the
time.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
might
say
this.
the
--
the
first
order,
you
are
ordered
to
report
to
the
local
board
named
above
where
you
will
be
given
instructions,
in
each
case,
the
registrant
did
that.
he
was
given
instructions.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
now,
we
get
down
to
the
second
order.
you
are
ordered
to
report
for
employment
pursuant
to
the
instructions
of
the
local
board.
you
are
ordered
to
report
pursuant
to
the
instructions
of
the
local
board.
that
is
the
obligation
that
the
omission
of
which
occurred
at
the
place.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
the
--
this
instruction
qualifies
the
order
--
orders
given
above.
it's
a
simple
explanation
to
--
to
the
registrant
of
what
he
is
to
do.
now,
ordinarily,
when
a
person
is
to
report
at
a
place
at
a
fixed
hour,
it
--
it
would
be
the
usual
thing
to
say
that
you
must
proceed
there.
that's
an
explanation
to
--
that
--
that
it
perhaps
is
in
artful
but
is
on
the
whole
accurate.
if
a
person
is
to
go
to
work
on
monday,
why
it's
understood
that
he
must
proceed
to
the
place
of
work,
particularly
where
in
most
case
at
the
place
of
work,
it
is
--
it
is
at
some
distance.
i
don't
think
that
this
explanation,
however,
an
article
would
qualify
the
two
orders.
these
registrants
are
--
are
held
to
know
their
--
their
duties
under
the
--
under
the
selective
service
laws
and
if
they
don't
know
them,
the
very
purpose
for
this
meeting
at
the
local
board
for
their
coming
in
is
to
--
is
to
ask
questions
and
find
out
more.
it
would
probably
be
unnecessary
for
these
registrants
to
come
to
the
local
board.
and
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
in
some
cases
that
process
is
short
circuit
at
somewhat.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
we
don't
--
we
don't
take
that
position
because
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
we
don't
take
the
position
that
the
proceeding
in
the
sense
of
traveling
to
the
destination
is
a
fixed
obligation
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
he
refused
to
report
the
duty,
of
course,
because
he
refused
to
--
to
report.
that's
given
his
one
order
to
report
and
do
the
work.
he
--
he
neither
report
it
nor
did
he
do
the
work.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
we
only
indicted
each
of
these
registrants
for
failure
to
report
and
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
obviously,
a
failure
to
report
to
employment
is
a
failure
committed
at
the
place
of
employment
that
this
has
been
our
estimation
and
that
is
the
--
commonly
understood,
meaning
of
that
--
of
that
order
and
we
think
the
order
is
--
is
the
disobedience
to
that
part
of
the
order
is
--
is
charged
here
sufficiently
in
these
indictments.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
no
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
the
case
and
the
statute,
in
fact,
in
section
6
(j)
of
the
act
says,
"any
person
who
fails
or
neglects
to
obey
any
such
order
from
his
local
board."
now,
the
orders
i
said
is
--
is
really
two
orders.
one
of
the
--
the
second
order
which
--
with
which
we're
concerned
is
to
report
to
the
employment.
true
that
the
order
issues
from
the
local
board
but
it's
also
true
that
the
act,
which
is
compelled
to
be
performed
by
the
registrant,
is
to
be
performed
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
in
other
words,
it's
to
be
performed
where
the
work
is
located.
now,
that
in
our
estimation,
under
section
6
(j)
of
the
act,
is
a
--
a
failure
or
neglect
to
obey
the
order
and
the
disobedience
occurs
in
the
place
of
work.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
at
new
castle,
even
though
the
order
reached
him
while
he
was
in
--
in
hawaii
because
the
--
the
--
in
those
cases
now,
this
order
is
mailed
to
the
mailing
address
of
the
registrant
in
the
--
in
those
cases
where
the
local
board,
where
he
fails
to
report
to
the
local
board,
why
the
venue
lies
at
the
--
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
local
board
no
matter
where
he
is
when
he
receives
that
order.
and
very
often,
they
are
far
away
from
the
local
board
when
they
receive
the
order
which
is
mailed
to
his
mailing
address.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
right.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
theoretically
to,
as
i
said,
we
--
we
don't
--
we
usually
refer
this
man
out
of
the
state
in
which
they
--
they
lived
and
assume
what
the
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
theoretically,
i
suppose
they
could,
but,
actually,
that
problem
--
it
doesn't
really
concern
us
here
and
i
don't
think
ever
will
concern
us
because
they
don't
make
that
type
of
order,
obligating
a
man
to
travel
long
distance.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
the
order
to
report
to
the
local
board,
mr.
justice
black,
is
the
first
order.
the
order
to
report
for
employment
is
the
second
order.
two
orders,
two
places.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
if
--
i
--
i
think
that
if
he
didn't
obey
the
first
order,
i
--
i
think
that
--
we
--
he
would
only
be
indictable
under
that
for
a
failure
to
appear
to
the
local
board.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
don't
think
he
can.
i
think
that
if
we
had
that
problem,
why,
i
--
i
think
that
it
would
--
as
--
they're
--
they're
links
in
the
chain,
in
both
in
the
process
of
induction
and
the
process
of
assigning
conscientious
objectors
to
work
of
national
importance.
i
think
that
where
--
unless
the
--
the
person
has
--
has
done
a
--
an
act
which
violates
all
of
the
duties
henceforward
in
the
--
in
the
process
of
abandoning
the
duties
under
that
chain,
i
think
we'll
--
we
would
have
to
prosecute
him
one
at
a
time
in
the
case
of
that
sort.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
there's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
there
--
not
exactly.
there
are
two
orders.
the
three
--
there
are
three
obligation,
three
separate
duties
which
must
be
carried
out.
the
first
duty
is
in
the
area
of
the
local
board.
the
second
two
duties
necessarily
are
in
the
area
of
the
work
assignment.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
upon
the
report
and
the
other
to
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
stay
on
duty
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
for
24
consecutive
months.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
he
is
committed
one
crime.
he's
--
he's
committed
the
crime
--
he's
--
he's
violated
the
whole
order
in
that
case.
that
the
whole
order
for
that,
i
mean
you
are
ordered
to
report
and
to
remain
in
employment
for
24
months.
if
he
does
not
report
or
if
he
fails
after
reporting,
fails
to
stay
for
24
months,
he's
violated
the
--
the
terms
of
that
second
order
either
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
one
crime
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
one
order,
one
crime,
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
if
he
could
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
right.
he's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
one
order,
one
crime.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
because
the
first
order
is
--
i'm
--
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
terms
second
order
in
our
colloquy
on
that.
the
first
order
is
to
report
to
the
local
board
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
that's
the
venue
as
local
board.
the
second
order
is
to
report
for
employment
and
to
remain
in
employment
for
24
months.
now,
a
violation
of
that
second
order
may
occur
either
where
the
registrant
fails
to
report
for
employment
or
where
he
fails
to
carry
through
for
24
months
as
ordered.
thank
you.
