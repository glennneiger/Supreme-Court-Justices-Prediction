well,
what
about
6
(j)
of
the
act?
justice
stanley
reed
and
do
we
have
some
cases
merely
on
that
one
to
two
years
ago?
justice
stanley
reed
well
there
were
some
other
cases
here
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
about
that
--
that
were
passed
on
in
this
court,
right?
justice
stanley
reed
i
suppose
the
--
the
registrant
could
have
been
indicted
for
refusal
to
proceed
in
the
--
in
the
particular
district
which
they
refused
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
stanley
reed

come
you
don't
take
that
position
but
did
an
indictment
for
that
but

justice
stanley
reed
--

you
could
have?
justice
stanley
reed
that
the

that
the
statute
said
refused
to
perform
any
duty.
justice
stanley
reed
certainly,
he
refused
to
perform
the
duty
and
told
you
he
wouldn't
but
this
person
--
the
district,
did
he
not?
justice
stanley
reed
no,
but
he
--
has
refused
to
perform
these
duties
required
of
him
under
the
language
statute
of
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
when
you
came
to
indict
him
was
--
did
you
make
a
(inaudible)
i
read
the
indictment
as
to
how
--
making
a
distinction
between
performing,
using
to
perform,
and
the
recording,
ordered
him
to
report.
you
only
--
they
only
indicted
him
for
failing
to
report.
