mr.
hayden
c.
covington
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
involve
an
important
question
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
three
men
had
cases
in
the
district
courts
that
raised
one
single
question,
namely,
that
of
venue
and
jurisdiction.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
district
court
located
where
a
hospital
is
situated
to
which
these
registrants
have
been
ordered
to
do
civilian
work
as
conscientious
objectors
by
their
local
boards
had
jurisdiction
or
does
the
constitution,
that
is,
the
amendment
as
well
as
article
iii,
limit
the
jurisdiction
exclusively
to
the
place
where
the
local
board
was
situated.
the
question
involved
here
is
one
that
was
mentioned
but
left
open
in
the
case
of
--
decided
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
anderson,
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs.
the
facts
in
these
cases
were,
that
johnson
and
sokol
were
indicted
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
johnson
and
sokol
were
charged
with
having
failed
to
perform
civilian
work
at
hospitals
located
in
the
eastern
district.
they
were
registered
with
draft
boards
in
the
western
district
near
pittsburgh
and
they
were
charged
with
violating
the
selective
training
and
service
act,
because
they
did
not
do
this
work
as
far
as
the
indictments
show.
stipulations
were
filed
in
the
cases
showing
that
these
men
registered
with
these
boards,
that
they
completed
their
administrative
remedies
by
appealing
their
cases
were
passed
by
these
conscientious
objectors
ordered
to
do
work
at
these
two
separate
hospitals
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
they
went
to
their
boards
and
explained
to
the
boards
that
they
refused
to
perform
this
work.
johnson
filed
a
letter
with
the
board.
sokol
merely
notified
his
board
orally
that
he
was
not
proceeding
further.
the
stipulation
show
that
neither
these
two
men
proceeded
any
further.
they
remained
in
the
district
and
did
not
take
this
second
step
that
they've
been
ordered
to
take
to
proceed
on
to
the
hospital.
the
patteson
case
comes
up
from
kansas.
that
it
involved
an
oklahoma
city
man
charged
with
failing
to
comply
with
an
order,
issued
by
an
oklahoma
city
draft
board
to
do
work
at
the
state
hospital
located
in
topeka,
kansas.
the
case
started
out
in
kansas,
judge
mellott
transferred
the
case
down
to
oklahoma
city.
judge
wallace
transferred
it
back.
then
judge
mellott
sustained
my
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
the
government
took
an
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
as
they
did
to
the
third
circuit
in
the
pennsylvania
cases
after
judge
ganey
sustained
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
that
case.
the
tenth
circuit
ruled
in
my
favor.
the
third
circuit
ruled
against
us
on
the
point.
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
vital
and
crucial
step
in
these
cases
was
that
of
proceeding
from
the
local
board
at
oklahoma
city
to
the
state
hospital
in
kansas.
and
that
the
refusal
to
take
this
step
and
the
failure
to
take
it
constituted
the
offense
and
that
it
was
committed
in
the
district
of
oklahoma
city.
that
is,
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
and
therefore,
judge
mellott
was
right
when
he
sustained
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
third
circuit
held
that
really
what
was
involved
here
was
the
ultimate
work
that
these
men
were
ordered
to
do.
and
that
since
this
work
should
have
been
performed
and
was
to
be
performed
at
these
two
hospitals
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
that
the
failure
to
do
that
work
occurred
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
these
men
did
not
leave
the
western
district,
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
their
local
board
was
located
in
the
western
district,
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
the
order
was
made
in
the
western
district,
and
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
the
refusal
or
the
failure
took
place
in
the
western
district.
now,
the
thing
that
is
crucial,
which
in
my
judgment
proves
the
omission
on
the
part
of
the
third
circuit,
in
seeing
the
real
issue
involved
here
was
that
they
overlooked
the
vital
fact.
and
i
would
like
to
call
attention
of
the
court
to
the
last
page
of
the
government's
brief.
and
this
contains
a
copy
of
one
of
the
orders.
this
is
the
identical
order
that
was
issued
to
each
of
these
men
and
if
i
may
do
so,
i
would
like
to
have
you
gentlemen
make
a
note
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
put
32
c.f.r.1606.51--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
32
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
it's
at
the
last
page
of
the
government's
brief,
page
56.32
c.f.r.1606.51
(a).
now
that's
the
regulation
that
i
neglected
to
put
in
my
reply
brief,
which
i
should
have
done.
i'd
like
to
ask
the
chief
justice
he'd
allow
me
this
file
a
typewritten
copy
of
it
in
a
day
or
two,
if
i
may,
for
the
convenience
of
the
justices.
now,
that
regulation
says
that
these
forms
are
a
part
of
the
law.
they
are
a
part
of
the
regulations.
now,
what
i
want
call
you,
your
attention
to
is
the
fact
that
this
order,
you
notice,
has
three
commands.
command
number
1
is
to
go
to
the
board.
now
these
three
commands
are
vital
in
this
case.
number
1
is
to
come
to
the
board.
number
2
is
to
proceed
from
the
board
to
the
hospital.
and
number
3
is
to
perform
the
work
at
the
hospital.
i
also
call
your
attention
to
the
warning
that's
in
that
which
indicates
again
that
there
are
three
separate
and
distinct
steps
in
three
separate
and
distinct
offenses.
number
1
says,
if
you
don't
show
up
at
the
board,
you're
guilty
of
violating
the
law.
number
2
is,
if
you
don't
show
up
--
rather
if
you
don't
proceed
from
the
board
to
the
hospital,
you're
guilty
of
violating
the
law.
and
number
3
is,
if
you
do
not
stay
at
the
hospital
and
perform
the
work,
you
shall
violate
the
law.
now
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
mr.
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
occurs
is
that
when
the
man
gets
there,
he
is
given
instructions
as
to
where
to
proceed
to.
go
to
the
hospital,
and
he
is
told
what
time
to
be
there.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
oh
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
shown
on
the
face
of
the
order.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
of
course,
if
he
went
straight
to
the
hospital,
he
would
not
be
complying
with
the
board's
order
because
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
--
it
--
technically,
yes.
i'm
quite
sure
of
that.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes,
sir.
there
are.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
he
would
be.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
not
if
there
were
three
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no.
i
wouldn't
be
taking
any
different
position.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
i
would
--
it
would
depend
on
what
the
circumstances
were.
number
1
is,
if
he
did
not
show
up
at
--
at
the
board
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--he
would
be
violating
the
law.
and
of
course
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
but
on
number
2
--
on
number
2
may
i
answer.
on
number
2,
it
would
be
obvious
he
couldn't
be
guilty
of
that
because
they
had
not
yet
given
the
order.
on
number
3,
he
couldn't
be
guilty
of
that
because
he
could
not
get
assignment
to
do
this
work
until
he
got
to
the
hospital.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that
is
right,
your
honor,
but
bear
in
mind
as
this
court
said
in
falbo
that
the
whole
selective
process
is
a
connected
series
of
steps
that
begin
with
registration
and
ends
with
the
induction
under
the
armed
forces
are
into
the
cps
work
under
the
1940
law
which
would
be
civilian
work
now.
now,
judge
kaufman
in
united
states
against
romano,
used
the
metaphor
that's
very
much
in
point,
and
he
said
that
each
of
these
is
like
a
link
in
a
chain.
and
of
course,
the
failure
to
do
any
one
of
these
particular
links,
take
one
either
one
of
these
links
or
steps
is
a
separate
offense.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
--
but
i
think
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
may
it
please,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
happened
in
these
cases.
and
what
happened
in
these
cases
were,
that
these
men
obeyed
command
number
1,
order
number
1
in
this
written
order.
they
went
to
the
board.
so
that
couldn't
possibly
be
a
violation
there.
the
only
order
that
the
facts
show
that
was
violated
in
this
case
was
the
failure
to
proceed
from
the
board
to
the
hospital,
which
was
the
second
order.
now
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
it
--
your
honor
the
evidence
doesn't
show
here
just
what
time
you
assume
that
the
board
would
be
reasonable
about
it
and
allow
him
to
get
there,
providing
that
ordinary
use
and
means
of
transportation
were
taken.
now
sometimes,
they
may
allow
him
two
or
three
days
and
again
they
may
allow
him
a
day.
but
the
man
has,
in
this
act,
a
discretion
as
to
how
he
used
to
travel.
under
the
1940
law,
the
conscientious
objector
was
given
a
bus
ticket
or
a
railroad
ticket
to
proceed
from
the
board
to
cps
camp.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
but
in
any
event,
that
would
all
depend
on
the
proof
that
would
take
place.
that
would
be
a
question
more
of
proof
as
to
whether
he
violated
or
not.
but
if
number
2
order
was
violated
by
refusing
to
proceed,
and
the
issue
is
not
here,
whether
or
not
the
man
is
guilty
or
not
guilty,
it's
where
did
the
offense
take
place.
that's
the
point.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
if
he
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
sir?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
but
that
--
that
is
absolutely
right.
but
he
does
not
comply
with
that
second
order
until
he
gets
to
the
hospital
and
when
he
gets
to
the
hospital
then
he's
complied
with
it.
then
he's
got
number
3
order
to
face
when
he
gets
to
the
hospital.
when
he
is
handed
this
work
to
accept
employment.
it's
not
service
in
the
army,
it's
ordinary
employment.
it's
a
contractual
relationship.
now,
my
point
is
and
this
is
the
crucial
thing
that
had
been
overlooked
by
the
government
and
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
and
it's
a
thing
that
the
tenth
circuit
very
clearly
saw
the
distinction
and
the
difference
between.
the
government
has
overlooked
and
taken
out
of
this
case
completely,
this
command
number
2.
they
say
that
the
man
is
guilty
of
violating
order
number
3.
whereas
the
record
in
the
case
shows
that
the
men
are
guilty
of
violating
order
number
2.
well
now,
that's
the
only
position
that
the
government
can
take
in
this
case
in
order
to
win,
gentlemen.
they
have
to
cut
that
out
of
the
law.
but
they
cannot
perform
such
a
major
operation
on
the
law
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
because
this
order,
which
is
a
part
of
the
regulations,
was
a
command
number
2
that
they
go
from
this
draft
board
to
those
hospitals
and
there
perform
work.
they
went
to
the
board.
they
refused
to
proceed
farther
--
farther
in
the
matter,
any
--
any
further.
and
that
refusal
to
take
that
second
step,
a
defiance
of
the
second
link
or
chain
in
this
link
of
a
chain
of
this
process,
constituted
the
offense
in
this
case.
now,
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
allow
the
government
to
manufacture
through
some
sort
of
wordy,
hocus-pocus,
a
new
offense,
an
offense
that
was
not
committed.
people
have
the
right
to
be
tried
in
the
district
where
the
controversy
arose
and
the
conflict
occurred
and
the
crime
occurred.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
--
i
wonder
if
i
could
do
this,
your
honor.
may
i
call
your
attention
first
to
the
statute?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
the
statute
appears
on
pages
3
and
4
of
my
brief.
now,
section
6
(j)
is
the
provision
of
the
act
in
respect
to
conscientious
objectors.
it
says,
it
--
it
outlines
the
procedure
for
the
conscientious
objector
in
the
department
of
justice,
but
this
statute
is
merely
declaratory.
it
says
that
if
a
conscientious
objector
neglects
or
fails
--
neglects
or
fails
to
do
the
work
that
he
is
ordered
to
do,
he
should
be
guilty
of
violating
the
law.
but
turn
now
to
the
fourth
and
this
is
the
really
--
the
statute
that's
involved,
but
the
government
wants
to
ignore
this
--
this
statute.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
sir?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no,
i
was
reading
from
the
act.
i
mean
i
was
reading
from
the
order
a
moment
ago.
i
now
call
your
attention
to
the
third
page
of
my
brief.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
that
is
it,
your
honor.
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
my
main
brief.
and
it
says
there,
the
fourth
line,
"of
any
such
person
who
knowingly
fails
or
neglects
to
obey
any
such
order
from
his
local
board
shall
be
deemed
for
the
purpose
of
section
12
of
this
title
to
have
knowingly
failed
and
neglected
to
perform
a
duty.
now,
notice
that
it
says
just
two
words,
"failed
and
neglected",
but
turn
now
to
--
i
mean
look
on
to
section
12
(a),
next,
which
is
the
criminal
sanctions
clause
of
the
entire
act.
it
says,
"any
person,
who
or
any
person
or
who
in
any
manner
shall
knowingly
fail
or
neglect
or
refuse
to
perform
any
duty
required
of
him
under"
and
then
it
goes
on
down
there
"shall
upon
conviction
on
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
of
competent
jurisdiction
be
punished."
now,
notice
that
the
--
the
statute
there
uses
the
word
"refused."
the
government
in
their
argument
and
their
approach
to
this
matter
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
third
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
accepted
it,
they
just
cut
that
word
"refused"
out
of
the
law.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
"or
refuse."
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
it
--
it
says
well
the
point
--
it's
--
it's
something
that
comes
up
incidental
to
their
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
they
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
don't
pass
them
on.
they
set
it
up.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
fail
or
neglect
or
refuse.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
i
think
so.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
now,
let's
turn
to
the
record
in
the
first
two
cases
that
is
the
johnston
and
sokol
case
were
two
separate
cases
in
the
courts
below.
the
record
643,
on
page
3
of
the
record,
we
have
the
sokol
indictment.
it
says
there
about
six
lines
down,
"did
knowingly
neglect
to
perform
a
duty
imposed
upon
him
by
the
provisions
of
said
act
and
that
he
failed
or
report
to
the
philadelphia
state
hospital
in
the
roosevelt
boulevard
in
south
hampton
road,
philadelphia,
pennsylvania
for
assignment.
and
then,
turn
to
page
4
and
we
have
the
indictment
in
the
companion
case
of
sokol
and
it
says
about
the
sixth
line
of
from
the
end
of
the
indictment,
"and
that
he
failed
and
refused
to
obey
an
order
of
the
local
board
87,
new
castle,
pennsylvania
directing
him
to
report
for
employment
at
norristown
state
hospital
in
norristown,
pennsylvania.
now,
that's
the
only
one
of
these
indictments
which
says
refused
to
obey
an
order.
the
other
one
said
he
failed
to
show
up
at
the
hospital
in
the
sokol
case.
now,
let's
take
the
record
in
the
patteson
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
tenth
circuit
case.
the
indictment
is
on
page
1
and
six
or
seven
lines
up
there,
it
says,
for
the
said
dudley
a.
patteson,
ordering
him
to
report,
talks
about
mailing
him
the
order
to
report
on
july
26,
1954
and
that's
at
the
board.
for
a
civilian
work
contributing
to
the
maintenance
of
the
national
health,
safety,
and
interest
and
said
board
deemed
appropriate
and
he,
the
said
dudley
a.patteson,
did
knowingly
and
willfully
refuse
and
neglect
and
fail
to
report
at
the
topeka
state
hospital
at
the
time
and
place
so
designated
on
the
said
order.
now,
that's
--
that
is
the
indictment
in
each
of
the
three
cases.
now,
the
procedure
i'd
like
to
mention
now,
the
procedure
under
the
selective
service
law,
you
gentlemen
well
know
from
the
cases
that
we've
had
here,
that
the
first
step
is
registration.
the
second
step
is
filing
a
questionnaire.
the
third
step
is
taking
a
pre-induction
physical
examination
and
comes
the
appeal.
then
there
is
an
appeal
board
determination
and
that,
of
course,
is
followed
by
an
order.
if
the
man
is
classified
for
military
service,
he's
ordered
to
go
to
the
induction
station
to
submit
to
induction
to
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
if
he
had
been
classified
as
a
conscientious
objector,
he
is
ordered
to
report
to
the
board
and
there
proceed
to
the
hospital
as
you've
seen
in
these
orders
here,
this
ordered
here.
there
is
one
additional
difference
in
the
conscientious
objector
procedure.
while
the
case
is
on
appeal
or
rather
after
the
case
comes
back
from
the
appeal
board
after
the
department
of
justice
procedure
mentioned
in
section
6
(j)
is
completed,
it
comes
back.
then,
it
becomes
necessary
that
the
registrant
first
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
choice
of
the
type
of
work
he
wants
to
take
that
contributes
to
national
importance
in
health
and
welfare.
then
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
then
the
board
offers
him
the
three
and
he
can
select
one.
if
they
can't
agree
on
that,
then,
there's
a
hearing
after
that
with
the
state
director
present.
and
if
they
don't
agree
on
that,
then
the
state
director
and
the
board
together
arbitrarily
or
wouldn't
say
arbitrarily,
pursuant
to
law,
select
a
type
of
work.
and
then
after
that
selection,
then
this
final
order
comes.
and
then,
of
course,
the
--
that's
--
that
procedure
was
followed
in
these
cases.
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
procedure
followed
and
the
steps
taken
on
a
different
classification.
my
basic
contention
here
is
that
this
third
order
was
--
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
only
order
that
is
involved
in
these
three
cases
is
the
one,
number
2,
proceed
to
the
hospital
and
a
failure
and
a
refusal
to
proceed
to
the
hospital.
and
that
is
the
one
that
we
must
look
at
in
these
cases.
the
government
has
not
really
drawn
a
very
specific
indictment
and
gone
into
great
detail.
they
didn't
make
any
attempt
to
distinguish
between
these
separate
orders
in
this
written
order.
my
point
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
and
since
the
constitution
deals
with
realities
and
not
shells
and
shadows
and
allegations,
the
records
in
these
cases
show
what
the
facts
were.
the
facts
show
that
these
men
violated
order
number
2.
and
this
violation
occurred
when
they
went
to
the
board
and
refused.
or
if
they
didn't
show
up
at
the
board,
it
would
be
a
failure
to
report
to
the
board
or
a
refusal
to
report
to
the
board.
but
here
they
came
to
the
board
and
the
fact
that
they
said
what
they
did
or
filed
a
letter
is
really
immaterial.
they
could
have
been
moot,
absolutely,
stand
moot
and
say
nothing.
and
turn
away
and
walk
out
after
they
have
been
given
these
orders
to
proceed
and
go
to
the
hospital
and
that
would
be
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
second
order.
now
since
that
--
that
is
the
fact,
how
in
the
world
can
the
government
come
along
and
manufacture
a
violation
of
this
third
order
by
merely
saying
that
he
did
not
do
the
work.
it's
true
that
he
didn't
do
the
work,
but
the
work
did
not
come
into
play
until
the
second
order
has
been
violated.
i
mean
it
has
been
complied
with.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
don't
think
so,
because
after
all,
if
he
went
ahead,
then
he
--
it
would
just
be
--
then
it
would
be
a
nullification
of
what
he'd
previously
said.
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
you
don't
indict
a
man
for
a
declaration.
you
can't
convict
him
for
saying
“i
intend
to
kill.”
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
you
convict
him
because
he
kills,
shoots.
now,
if
a
man
says,
“i'm
going
to
kill
somebody,”
and
then
he
changed
his
mind
and
doesn't
do
it,
well
then,
of
course,
you
can't
indict
him
and
can
convict
him
of
murder.
but
if
he
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
kill
him,”
and
then
he
goes
ahead
and
kills
him
why
then,
you've
got
him
for
murder.
and
it's
the
same
situation
here.
these
men
are
not
to
be
tried
because
of
their
declarations.
the
declaration
becomes
material
as
an
evidentiary,
a
subsidiary
matter
because
it
proves
that
they
refused.
but
they
could
have
refused
and
failed
even
without
saying
a
word
in
these
cases.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right
and
these
motions
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
i
don't
agree
--
i
don't
agree
to
that
on
--on
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
disagree
with
that
because
of
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
suppose
now,
that
the
government
comes
along
with
the
phony
indictment.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
alright
now
then,
i'm
just
going
to
say
this.
they
say
that
a
man
violates
the
law
by
not
doing
civilian
work.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
think
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
venue
under
the
sixth
amendment,
your
honor,
you
can
go
behind
the
indictment
as
we
did
with
the
motion
papers
and
the
motion
to
dismiss.
and
as
the
court
permitted
us
to
do
in
the
sokol
and
johnston
cases
by
filing
stipulations
between
the
state
--
between
the
government
and
the
defendants
in
the
case
as
to
what
had
happened.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
out
is
this,
your
honor,
let
me
make
a
hypothetical
situation.
suppose
the
---
and
--
and
just
to
show
you
the
extreme
hardships
they
fought
--
your
suggestion
as
hypothetically
is
correct.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
if
--
if
not
then
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
alright.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
still
the
court
--
if
the
court
takes
the
indictment,
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
supporting
affidavits
and
the
stipulations,
then
you've
got
all
the
facts
that
the
court
below
had
and
which
they
determined
these
questions
on.
and
they
show,
not
a
violation
at
the
hospital
in
the
district
where
these
indictments
were
returned,
but
they
show
a
violation
only
in
the
district
where
the
boards
were
relocated.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
only.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
but
your
honor,
they
have
not
violated
the
third
one.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
the
point.
and
i
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
allow
an
indictment
to
be
brought
charging
a
violation
of
the
third
one
which
did
not
occur.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
i'm
saying
if
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i'm
saying
it
couldn't
have
occurred.
allegation
under
the
facts
in
these
cases.
absolutely
couldn't
have
occurred.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
the
record.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
oh,
the
order.
it's
on
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
page
59
at
the
back
of
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
mean
56,
in
the
government's
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
it
couldn't
have
been.
absolutely,
couldn't
have
been.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
they
couldn't
have
been
because
the
one
that
it
shows
they
violated
was
the
failure
to
proceed.
now,
how
could
it
be
if
--
if
there
are
three
chains
and
are
part
in
it
--
i
mean
three
links
in
a
chain.
and
i
get
no
further
than
the
first
link
that
i
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
third
link.
it
just
couldn't
be.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
i
--
i
must
say
that
they
--
we
do
have
three
links
in
this
order.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
we've
got
one
written
order
that
commands
three
separate
things.
number
one,
come
to
the
board.
that's
--
that's
a
link.
number
two,
proceed
from
the
board
in
this
district
to
the
board
in
the
--
and
i
mean
to
the
hospital
in
another
district.
that's
the
second
link.
we've
got
the
third
link
which
is
do
--
do
work
at
the
hospital.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that
is
the
position,
technically
correct.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
technically
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
it'd
be
entirely
irrelevant
to
this
question.
and
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
am
--
my
only
question
is
this.
where
did
this
offense
occur?
nothing
else.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
the
duties
are
plain
in
this
order,
your
honor.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
one
--
but
that
was
never
gotten
to,
the
one
that
was
violated,
the
one
that
was
violated
was
the
duty
to
proceed
from
the
board
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
to
the
eastern
district.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
not
on
--
you
can't
do
it
in
the
one
act,
that's
definite.
there's
where
the
--
there's
where
the
error
is.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
if
he
didn't
report
at
all,
mr.
justice
minton,
then
he
would
be
guilty
of
failing
to
report
to
the
board.
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
failing
to
proceed
to
the
hospital
and
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
failing
to
perform
the
work.
well,
your
honor,
there
must
be
some
definite
lines
drawn
in
this
matter
because
you
just
can't
charge
a
man
with
violating
the
selective
service
law.
he's
got
to
be
charged
with
the
precise
violation.
and
the
precise
violation
here
in
this
case
is
that
he
failed
to
take
the
second
step,
not
the
third
step.
the
third
step
is
done
only
in
the
district
where
these
prosecutions
were
brought.
the
second
step
is
done
only
in
the
district
where
the
boards
were
located
and
where
we
claim
that
the
persecution
should
have
been
brought.
and
therefore,
therein
lays
the
distinction
there.
you
cannot
have
an
offense
of
just
violating
the
selective
service
law.
now,
let
me
tell
you
the
hardships
that
come
from
this
sort
of
a
thing.
and
surely,
you
must
consider
the
hardships
that
are
involved
on
our
side
in
determining
if
you
permit
the
government
to
do
this
sort
of
thing.
just
to
charge
a
man
with
violating
a
fictitious
offense
that
never
--
he
never
had
a
chance
to
do.
there
was
no
chance,
no
effort,
no
--
no
opportunity
to
refuse
to
do
work
at
that
hospital,
because
he
never
got
there.
he
was
never
given
the
opportunity
at
the
hospital.
he
has
to
be
at
the
hospital
before
he
can
refuse
work.
it's
a
contractual
relationship.
he
has
to
make
a
contract
with
the
hospital.
this
contract
can't
be
made
until
he
gets
to
the
hospital.
and
in
this
circumstance,
the
only
offense
that
he
can
be
guilty
of
is
the
one
that
occurred
at
the
board.
and
it's
--
you
can't
make
a
man
guilty
of
an
anticipatory
offense.
you
don't
have
any
anticipatory
offenses
here.
it's
real,
actual,
facts
that
occurred
here.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
if
your
honor,
still
that
doesn't
make
him
a
domestic
rebel
that's
liable
to
be
charged
with
anything.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
that
the
effect
of
this
argument
of
the
government
is
that
if
a
man
violates
one
of
these
orders
he
can
be
persecuted
anywhere.
he
can
be
prosecuted
where
he
didn't
violate
the
law.
now,
these
men
can
be
ordered
to
go
to
alaska.
they
can
be
ordered
to
go
to
hawaii.
and
if
a
man
can
be
taken
out
of
his
--
the
district
where
the
offense
occurred
and
sequestrated
from
his
witnesses
and
from
his
attorney
and
everywhere
else
and
taken
thousands
of
miles
away
to
stand
trial
then
i
say
that
there
has
been
by
semantics
a
resurrection
of
the
practice
that
was
condemned
in
the
sixth
amendment
and
in
the
constitution,
namely,
we
--
we're
all
familiar
with.
they
took
the
columnist
over
to
london
and
tried
him
there
instead
of
here.
now,
if
a
man
goes
to
eastern
district
and
violates
the
law
there
then
fine.
he
can
be
prosecuted
there.
that's
what
i
--
the
position
i
take
in
the
matter.
but
if
he
never
goes
there,
then,
how
can
he
be
guilty.
that
it
is
just
as
simple
as
that.
and
because
he
harged
a
man
with
violating
a
draft
board
order
that
has
three
separate
commands
in
it,
doesn't
authorize
the
prosecution
in
a
place
where
an
offense
never
occurred,
gentlemen.
i
--
well
your
honor
the
--
we're
not
here
challenging
the
validity
of
the
indictment,
we're
only
challenging
the
venue
in
jurisdiction.
sir?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
don't
think
so.
you
mean
it
was
not
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
say
i
could
be.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
but
he
didn't
report.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no,
i
don't
quite
understand
you,
justice
minton.
i
--
i
definitely
say
that
none
of
these
facts
were
laid
in
this
venue
and
any
of
the
courts
where
it
isn't
brought.
because
on
the
facts
shown
on
the
stipulations
and
in
then
the
motion
in
the
system
is,
the
offense
of
refusal
to
proceed
or
to
comply
with
the
second
order,
took
place
in
the
district
where
the
local
boards
were
located
by
--
it
took
place
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania,
it
took
place
in
the
district
of
--
western
district
of
oklahoma
and
did
not
take
place
in
the
district
of
kansas
and
did
not
take
place
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no,
it's
not
that
there
are
three
offenses
charged.
i'm
merely
saying
that
it's
--
my
argument
is
based
on
this.
that
there
are
three
separate
orders
or
commands
in
this
order
that's
involved.
and
the
one
that's
shown
to
have
been
violated
is
the
command
to
proceed
from
the
board
to
the
hospital.
and
that
is
the
crime
here.
he
couldn't
be
guilty
of
failing
to
report
to
the
board
because
he
reported.
he
couldn't
be
guilty
of
failing
to
do
the
work
because
he
was
never
there
to
enter
into
the
contractual
relationship
with
the
hospital.
so
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
your
honor,
it's
possible.
i'm
not
saying
that
there
are
three
offenses
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
sir?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
i
don't
think
that
it
could
be
three
offenses
because
there's
only
one
refusal
here
and
the
only
refusal
was
the
refusal
to
proceed.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
the
thing.
there
aren't
three
separate
offenses
that's
possible
to
be
committed.
but
there's
only
one
offense
that
can
be
committed
in
the
facts
in
this
--
in
this
case.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
if
your
honor,
there's
bound
to
be
several
different
offenses
because
there
are
several
different
duties
and
several
different
commands.
you
take
the
regulations.
they're
the
one
--
they're
part
of
the
--
the
law.
if
a
man,
say
at
times,
since
he
fails
to
register
that's
an
offense
isn't
it,
definitely.
separate
from
what
we
have
here.
if
he
fails
to
file
his
papers,
his
questionnaire,
it
he
fails
to
appear
before
the
board,
that's
a
separate
offense.
if
he
fails
to
take
physical
examination,
that's
a
separate
offense.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right
and
all
of
those
cases
they
take
place
at
the
board.
i
mean
they
--
the
--
the
violation
takes
place
in
the
district
court
where
the
board
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that
is
quite
correct
but
that's
not
the
situation
here.
the
--
the
situation
here,
is
a
separate
and
distinct
offense
only
which
could
have
only
have
occurred
here
now.
i'd
like
--
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
take
up
the
--
the
issue,
which
is
that
of
travel.
that's
--
that
is
a
very
vital
point
here,
namely,
travel.
the
government
admits
this.
they
admit
that
if
this
man
had
been
ordered
to
do
military
service
they
could
not
prosecute
him
anywhere
except
where
the
board
was
located.
if
he
showed
up
at
the
board
and
refused
to
go
to
the
induction
station,
i
admit
that
the
only
place
of
prosecution
is
where
the
board
is
located.
that's
been
their
policy.
under
the
old
law,
1940
law,
they've
prosecuted
conscientious
objectors
when
they
--
they
showed
up
the
board
and
refused
to
go
to
the
cps
camps
in
the
district
where
the
board
was
located.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
no,
your
honor.
it
--
the
way
they
make
the
distinction,
which
i
cannot
follow
at
all,
is
that
a
registrant
is
what
they
call
delivered.
he
gets
travel
instruction
papers,
and
a
bus
ticket
or
a
railroad
ticket
and
if
there
are
more
than
one
or
two
selectees
and
a
--
a
leader
is
appointed
but
if
he
is
the
only
one
and
he
goes
by
himself,
but
he
refuses
to
go
to
he
induction
station
he
is
prosecuted
where
the
board
is
located.
now,
that's
the
policy.
if
that's
good
for
a
man
who's
been
ordered
to
do
military
service
and
doesn't
do
it,
then
why
doesn't
it
apply
in
the
case
of
a
conscientious
objector?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no,
no
it's
not,
that's
not
the
case,
your
honor.
it's
paid,
military
pay.
it
does
not
start
until
he
is
been
inducted
into
the
service.
the
only
pay
he
gets
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
is
transportation
pay.
the
reason
the
conscientious
objector
doesn't
get
transportation
pay
is
because
he's
going
to
--
if
he
goes
to
the
board
--
i
mean
goes
to
the
hospital,
he's
going
to
get
a
good
job,
anyway
at
least
maybe
the
prevailing
wage
scale.
there's
no
provision
for
the
payment
of
transportation
charges.
and
there
in
lays
the
distinction
that
the
government
makes.
but
is
that
a
distinction?
if
--
if
travel
is
such
a
vital
link
and
a
refusal
to
do
travel
is
an
offense
in
a
military
case
that's
committed
at
the
board,
then
why
is
the
refusal
to
do
travel
in
a
conscientious
objector
case
not
committed
in
the
district
court
where
the
local
board
is
located.
the
position
that
the
government
takes
is
absolutely
inconsistent.
and
the
only
distinction
they
can
make
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
conscientious
objector,
he
has
discretion
to
choose
his
means
of
travel
and
he
can
pay
his
way.
whereas
in
the
case
of
a
military
service,
the
government
pays
his
way
and
he
cannot
exercise
his
discretion.
he's
got
to
go
by
bus
or
by
railroad
or
whatever
other
means
that
they
have
there
for
the
transportation
of
soldiers.
but
after
all,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
a
man
gets
to
the
induction
station
or
how
he
gets
to
the
hospital.
he
must
travel
and
travel
is
an
essential
link
or
duty
to
perform
which
in
these
cases
was
not
performed.
and
if
jurisdiction
and
venue
would
later
prosecute
a
man
that
had
been
ordered
to
do
military
service
in
the
district
where
the
local
board
is
located,
then
i
have
to
see
and
yet
have
explained
to
me
by
the
government
why
the
conscientious
objector
position
is
not
the
same.so,
travel
is
a
very
necessary
and
vital
link.
what
they've
done
is
to
define
an
--
an
anticipatory
offense.
a
man
should
not
be
convicted
because
of
an
anticipatory
offense.
he
can
only
be
convicted
for
something
that
he
fails
and
neglects
to
do.
and
none
of
these
men
had
an
opportunity
to
refuse
to
do
the
civilian
work
at
the
hospital.
that
is
my
point,
gentlemen.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
--
that's
the
point.
the
order
of
the
board
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
sir?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
well
that's
to
my
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
may
be
--
i
may
be
going
at
it
the
wrong
way.
but
as
i
read
the
order,
he
has
three
separate
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
realize
that
but
the
--
the
statute
says
that
he
shall
be
guilty
of
an
offense
if
he
disobeys
the
order.
then
we
turn
to
see
what
the
order
is
and
that
was
exactly
what
i
was
trying
to
do.
turn
to
this
order
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
--
that's
right.
but
it's
the
order
of
the
board,
not
the
order
of
the
hospital.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
didn't
say
it.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
sir?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
the
third
offense
would
be
if
he
went
to
norristown
and
then
refused
to
do
the
work.
that's
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
it'd
be
committed
where
the
board
was
located
because
he
did
not
travel
or
proceed
from
the
board
to
the
hospital.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that
is
exactly
--
i'm
trying.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that
is
--
that's
always
been
my
decision.
not
now,
it's
always
been
my
decision.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
he
only
commits
one.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
the
very
one
that
i
have
been
talking
about
all
afternoon.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well
,all
right.
i'm
just
telling
you
that
the
only
offense
that
he'd
be
guilty
of
is
the
failure
to
proceed
to
the
hospital
to
do
the
work.
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
two.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
not
in
every
instance.
only,
it
would
not
be
at
the
board
if
he
went
to
the
hospital,
entered
upon
the
work
and
then
left,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
then,
of
course,
the
only
place
the
offense
could
be
committed
is
that
the
board
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
and
that's
--
that's
the
position
i've
taken
in
my
briefs
in
which
i
take
here.
that
unless,
and
until
a
man
gets
to
the
hospital
and
enrolls
in
the
hospital
for
work,
accepts
employment,
makes
a
contract,
then,
the
only
thing
that
he
has
violated
is
the
order
that
the
board
gave
him
and
that
violation
occurred
where
the
board
is
located.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
the
crime
would
be
a
violation
of
the
board's
order
to
enter
into
the
contract,
proceed
or
rather
to
report
for
work.
i
would
take
the
analogy
--
rather
not
the
analogy
but
the
reasoning
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
jeffries
case
that
they
cite
in
their
opinion,
which
is
an
old
case
that
i
had
--
that
came
up
in
kansas
about
10
years
ago.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
yes,
ten
years
is
a
long
time
with
me
in
this
work,
i'll
guarantee
you.
why,
it
was
under
the
1940
act.
he
reported
at
the
board.
he
told
the
board
just
exactly
what
this
board's
told.
he
was
ordered
to
do
cps
work.
he
refused.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
rejected
my
argument
that
he
had
reported
at
the
board
for
this
cps
work
and
wasn't
guilty
of
that.
they
said
that
unless
a
man
reports
at
the
board
for
the
purpose
of
doing
this
work,
he
has
not
reported
for
a
civilian
work
in
the
jeffries
case
and
they
cite
that
case
in
this
patteson
thing.
now,
my
--
that
answers
the
question
that
you
put
to
me.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
except
this,
your
honor.
if
i
--
if
i
am
consistent
with
what
this
court
considered
in
the
gibson
case,
in
the
procedure
in
the
gibson
case
was
that
he
was
indicted
in
the
district
where
he
left
that
cps
camp.
that
was
a
policy
that
was
pursued
and
i
take
the
anderson
opinion,
too,
by
saying
that
if
a
man
goes
into
another
district
and
violates
an
order
or
refuses
in
another
district
to
comply
with
an
order
then
he
may
be
guilty
there.
that
was
dictum
in
the
anderson
case.
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
law
of
frankfurter.
i
think
that
the
only
way
that
we
can
avoid
getting
into
traps
is
to
lay
the
venue
in
all
of
these
cases
where
the
board
is
located
because
this
is
only
one
order
involved
but
the
court
--
this
court
held
to
the
contrary
in
anderson
case.
in
the
anderson
case
the
contention
was
made
that
when
a
man
went
to
the
induction
station
and
refused
to
step
forward
and
submit
the
induction
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
in
the
western
district
to
washington
at
the
induction
station
where
he
refused
to
submit
the
induction
and
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
eastern
district
of
spokane.
now,
personally,
i
think
that
the
doctrine
of
the
anderson
case
even
on
the
decision
made
ought
to
be
reconsidered
because
actually
what
they
had
was
the
order
of
the
local
board
and
until
a
man
complies
with
the
order,
he
has
violated
the
order
that
was
issued
at
the
board
because
the
place
of
venue
is
the
place
where
the
board
is
located
and
the
place
where
the
order
was
given.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes,
your
honor,
he'd
gone
clear
through
the
process
right
down
to
the
point
where
he
was
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that's
right.
it's
a
distinctive
situation
from
here
and
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
it.
i
just
say
that
what
was
said
in
anderson
doesn't
apply
here.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes,
indeed.
at
the
last
paragraph
in
the
anderson
opinion,
this
court
said
specifically
that
this
precise
question
we
have
here
is
open
and
we
do
not
decide
it.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
take
what
time
i
have
left,
a
few
minutes,
to
talk
about
the
question
that
justice
black
asked
me
yesterday
concerning
the
one
order
that
we
have
before
us.
it's
true
that
we
have
one
order
and,
of
course,
like
any
court
order,
it
may
have,
it
is
further
ordered
adjudged
in
the
decree
then
that's
what
he
have
here,
three
such
orders
but
it's
one
paper
order.
now,
the
trouble
that
we
have
been
talking
about
here
for
two
days
hairsplitting
the
single
order
into
three
separate
offenses
comes
about
as
results
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
anderson.
i
approach
this
case
in
order
to
argue
it
consistently
with
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
decision.
but
personally,
i
think,
united
states
against
anderson
was
erroneously
decided
for
the
reasons
that
mr.
justice
black
brought
out
yesterday.
we
have
here
one
order,
and
regardless
of
the
place
where
it
is
violated
are
not
carried
out,
it
is
the
place
of
the
board,
the
place
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
that
determines
it.
the
question,
the
cases
of
non-action
that
we
have
both
referred
to
in
our
briefs
are
all
cases
of
non-action
of
men
failing
to
come
to
the
place
where
the
board
of
the
court
was
situated
and
i
admit
that
the
failure
to
do
that
is
an
offense
where
the
board
is
located
and
those
cases
support
me
on
this
proposition.
they
are
authority
for
us
that
venue
lays
at
the
place
where
the
board
is
located.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
don't
say
that,
no.
i
say
that
there's
a
single
offense
depending
on
what
link
he
bought
that.
if
we
have
here
a
chain,
the
courts
have
so
held
it
is
chain
and
there's
only
a
single
offense
as
long
as
the
man
complies
with
all
the
orders.
and
when
he
boxed
at
one
order
then
he
is
guilty
of
only
one
offense
and
the
third
offense
becomes
an
anticipatory
offense
that
never
becomes
involved
here.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i'm
not
concerned
about
that.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
say
this,
your
honor,
that
the
sixth
amendment
was
intended
to
prevent
either
congressional
evasion
of
rights
of
people
under
the
constitution
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
are
both
but
still
that's
my
answer
to
it.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes.
that
is
all
true
and
that's
supports
my
proposition
too.
that
--
the
offense
here
occurs
at
the
tribunal.
i
made
an
illustration
in
my
reply
brief
and
it's
--
and
it's
brightly
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
and
that
is
still
true,
may
it
please
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
it
is
the
same
situation
here.
what
we
have
here
is
the
failure
to
--
to
come
to
the
board
and
the
failure
to
proceed
out
of
the
board.
now
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
why
that
wouldn't
--
put
it
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
prosecute
someone
in
paris.
it's
the
very
illustration
i
gave
in
my
reply
brief
in
analogy
and
i
want
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
--
each
one
of
you
to
remember
this.
and
if
i
tried
to
bring
it
close
to
home,
suppose
an
employee
of
this
court
was
ordered
to
go
to
richmond
to
pick
up
a
record
in
a
state
case
where
certiorari
had
been
granted,
and
he
says,
"no,
i'm
not
going."
now
then,
under
the
arguments
that
has
been
made
against
me,
the
only
place
where
he
can
be
prosecuted
is
in
richmond
which
is
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
--
now,
wait
a
minute.
here
--
i
want
to
answer
you
and
i'd
like
to
answer
it
because
i
don't
know
what
--
maybe
the
results
of
failure
to
answer
but
now
the
point
is
this,
if
congress
makes
an
act,
saying
that
a
man
should
obey
an
order
of
a
certain
board
doing
to
go
a
certain
place,
that
becomes
in
congressional
order
issued
at
the
place
of
the
board
and
then
you
would
be
at
the
place
of
the
board.
now,
if
what
is
suggested
to
me
is
correct,
then
if
a
man
defines
an
order
of
this
court
then
this
court
would
never
have
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
a
man
for
contempt
if
he
failed
to
go
to
richmond
and
get
a
record
and
it's
ridiculous.
and
besides
that,
it
puts
a
tremendous
burden
and
it
puts
an
unlimited
power
in
the
hands
of
administrative
agents
and
his
prosecutors
to
get
a
man
completely
out
of
the
district
where
the
controversy
arose
where
all
the
witnesses
are
and
get
him
into
a
foreign
area
where
nobody
knows
anything,
and
nobody
is
interested
in
it.
i
think
that
we've
got
to
be
realistic
people
and
deal
with
realities
and
not
fiction.
and
that's
what
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
that's
--
that's
exactly
what's
being
suggested
here.
and
i
say
the
whole
trouble
is
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
anderson.
i
didn't
want
to
assault
it
but
now
i'm
doing
it
unequivocally
and
ask
the
court
to
overrule
it.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
i
don't
mean
to
--
be
discourteous
and
i
am
not.
i
am
merely
as
emphatic
as
you
are,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
