mr.
bernard
weiss
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
comes
before
this
court
to
settle
a
conflict
in
legal
principles
arising
out
of
decisions
rendered
in
two
cases
in
this
particular
case
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
the
sixth
circuit.
now,
in
the
sixth
circuit
case,
the
name
of
the
case
was
cleveland
allerton
hotel
incorporated
versus
commission
of
internal
revenue,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
lessee
of
real
property,
the
owner
of
a
valuable
building
on
such
lease
land
is
entitled
to
deduct,
as
an
ordinary
expense
of
doing
business,
the
amount
of
a
payment
over
and
above
the
determined
value
of
the
land
on
the
date
of
the
purchase
in
order
to
be
relieved
of
the
burdensome
terms
of
the
lease.
in
the
second
circuit
under
an
identical
facts,
and
i
will
come
to
the
fact
in
a
moment,
held
that
the
petitioner,
lessee,
is
entitled
to
as
a
purchaser
of
a
bundle
of
rights,
which
bundle
of
rights
being
a
capital
asset
is
not
adoptable
under
section
23
(a)
of
the
u.s.
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
and
instead
that
the
bundle
of
rights
consist
of
are
reversionary
interest
in
land
and
a
reversionary
interest
in
building
and
that
the
--
that
an
allocation
of
the
amount
of
the
cost
of
the
--
of
the
property
may
be
allocated
between
the
value
attributable
to
the
building
and
the
reversionary
interest
--
reversionary
value
in
the
building
and
then
to
be
spread
over
the
remaining
economic
life
of
a
building
which
both
parties
to
this
proceeding
agree
is
30
years.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
these.
in
april
1924,
this
petitioner
entered
into
a
long
time
lease
under
the
terms
of
which,
he
was
required
to
construct
and
did
in
fact
construct
a
22-storey
concrete
and
steel
building
on
the
corner
of
seventh
avenue
and
38th
street,
new
york
city
at
a
cost
of
$3
million
under
the
terms
of
the
lease,
title
to
the
improvement.
title
to
the
building,
improvement,
conditions,
furniture
and
fixtures
was
to
remain
in
the
tenant
throughout
the
term
of
the
lease.
we
had
one
peculiar
provision
in
this
lease.
i'll
--
i'll
first
go
to
the
term
of
the
lease.
the
term
lease
of
the
lease
was
the
original
--
the
initial
term
of
the
lease
is
21
years.
the
lessee
had
the
right
and
had
the
option
to
renew
the
lease
for
an
additional
21
years
and,
thereafter,
from
additional
21
years
if
he
saw
fit
to
do
so.
under
the
terms
of
the
lease,
this
petitioner
was
to
pay
for
the
year
--
first
21
years
of
rental,
a
net
ground
rental
of
$100,000
plus
the
income
tax
thereon
which
both
parties
to
this
--
which
both
parties
to
that
agreement
agreed
was
equal
to
$18,840,
this
$18,840
being
an
additional
amount
of
payment
to
cover
the
income
tax
on
the
$100,000.
the
lease
--
the
lease
contained
a
provision
to
the
effect
that
at
the
termination
of
the
last
term
of
the
lease.
the
title
to
the
building
and
improvements
was
to
pass
to
the
landlord
at
his
option.
and
in
the
event
that
he
accept
the
title
for
this
property,
he
was
to
receive
it
free
and
clear
of
all
incumbencies
with
--
and
without
paying
therefore.
and
if
he
refused
to
accept
title
to
the
property,
title
to
the
building
and
improvements,
this
petitioner
was
required
to
raise
this
building
and
that
is
in
his
own
cost.
mr.
bernard
weiss
yes,
two
options
--
mr.
bernard
weiss
--
for
renewal.
i
haven't
given
him
the
terms
of
the
options
of
renewal.
mr.
bernard
weiss
the
terms
of
the
option
for
renewal
where
these.
that
in
the
event
that
this
petitioner
were
to
renew
the
lease,
the
property
--
the
land
had
to
be
appraised
as
if
vacant
and
unimproved
and
evaluation
of
6%
--
and
6%
of
--
of
the
evaluation
of
this
land
as
if
vacant
and
unimproved
would
determine
the
amount
of
the
rental
to
be
paid
for
the
succeeding
21
years.
but
in
no
event
was
the
rental
to
be
less
than
$100,000,
plus
this
additional
sum
of
$18,840
representing
the
income
tax
thereon.
in
april
of
1945,
this
petitioner
renewed
the
lease
and
he
renewed
it
at
the
--
at
the
so-called
--
but
i
would
like
to
refer
to
as
the
saving
clause,
the
minimum
clause,
a
$100,000
plus
the
$18,840.
and
the
reason
for
that
being
that
the
landlord
waived
an
appraisal
of
the
land
for
the
reason
that
6%
of
the
value
of
the
land
on
the
date
the
lease
was
renewed
would
have
reduced
a
rental
of
less
than
$100,000.
in
may
of
1945,
this
petitioner
entered
into
a
contract
of
purchase
of
the
fee
to
the
land.
and
at
the
same
time,
we
--
the
agreement
provided
that
the
taxpayer
--
that
the
lessee
was
to
be
--
was
to
be
--
i
lost
the
train
of
my
thought.
i'll
ask
--
i
just
--
i'm
sorry.
it's
just
an
aberration.
let
me
see
where
i
left
off.
the
--
mr.
bernard
weiss
well,
now,
he
agreed
to
pay
$2,100,000
--
mr.
bernard
weiss
--
for
both
the
fee
to
the
land
and
a
cancellation
of
the
lease
and
a
release
of
the
obligations
of
the
lease.
mr.
bernard
weiss
in
june
of
1945,
title
to
the
property,
in
fact,
passed
through
this
petitioner
who
at
the
same
time
received
the
release
of
the
obligations
of
the
lease
and
the
cancellation
thereof.
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states
found
that
the
value
of
this
land,
vacant
and
unimproved,
on
the
date
of
the
purchase
of
this
land,
of
the
fee
to
the
land
was
$660,000.
if
$660,000
was
the
value
of
the
land,
vacant
and
unimproved,
under
the
terms
of
this
lease,
this
taxpayer
would
have
been
required
to
pay
a
rental
of
less
than
$40,000
per
year.
nevertheless,
under
the
terms
of
this
lease,
he
was
required
to
pay
$118,880
--
$119,840.
now,
the
reason
for
this
--
for
this
petitioner
renewing
the
lease
under
such
an
outrageous
condition
that
existed
at
the
time
was
this.
the
petitioner
having
constructed
a
building
at
a
cost
of
$3
million
had
a
remaining
--
which
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
purchase
the
property
had
a
remaining
economic
life
of
30
years
and
a
60%
value
of
the
original
cost.
now,
if
he
failed
to
renew
this
lease,
he
would
have
lost
his
interest
in
the
property
and
he
desire
to
retain
that
interest
most
naturally.
the
contentions
of
the
taxpayer
throughout
had
been,
throughout
all
the
proceedings
in
the
tax
court,
circuit
court
and
here,
is
that
the
tax
--
that
this
lessee
entered
into
this
transaction
for
the
purpose
of
being
relieved
of
the
burdensome
terms
of
a
lease.
and
it
is
the
contention
of
this
petitioner
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
any
lease
legally
entered
into
which
requires
a
--
a
lessee
to
pay
three
times
the
value
of
that
--
of
a
--
three
times
the
rental
value
of
a
property
for
a
period
of
21
years
from
the
time
you
have
--
you
renew
the
lease
is
a
burdensome
lease.
and
that
any
payment
made
to
get
out
from
under
such
a
lease
is
an
ordinary
expense
under
section
23
(a)
of
u.s.
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
shouldn't
be
allowed
as
a
deduction.
mr.
bernard
weiss
he
had
fully
depreciated
--
his
original
cost
was
fully
depreciated.
mr.
bernard
weiss
oh,
yes.
the
original
cost
had
been
depreciated
and
that
is
not
involved
in
the
case
in
view
of
the
ruling
of
the
court
and
it
will
be
recall
that
this
petitioner
made
a
request,
made
three
separate
requests.
one
of
which
was
not
acted
on
and
both
sides
--
there's
no
quarrel
with
the
finding
of
the
court
that
the
taxpayer
was
entitled
at
least
to
depreciation
on
the
value
of
the
building
at
the
date
of
the
acquisition
of
the
fee
in
1945
from
the
--
from
the
landlord
over
the
remaining
life
of
the
lease.
that
is
not
involved
in
this
proceeding
except
insofar
as
the
commissioner
would
like
this
court
to
consider
that
this
relief
that
the
petitioner
--
that
the
lessee
would
receive
by
allowing
him
depreciation
is
sufficient
depreciation
and
--
and
that
he
should
be
satisfied.
unfortunately,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
interpreted
this
way,
the
reversionary
value
with
the
building
to
mean,
that
this
building
shall
be
valued
as
if
it
were
21
years
older
and
we'll
take
the
value
--
the
--
then,
we
will
take
that
value
and
reduce
it
by
a
discount
to
arrive
at
what
amount
of
money
would
be
paid
today
to
arrive
at
some
sort
of
a
figure
which
represents
the
depreciated
value
of
the
building
21
years
since.
and
then
that
figure
would
be
allowed
by
way
of
depreciation
over
the
next
21
years.
that
is
the
way
they
are
interpreting
these
words
and,
of
course,
that
would
simply
mean
less.
under
a
calculation
that
they've
arrived
at
in
which
they've
told
me
in
which
it
has
nothing
--
it
doesn't
appeal
in
this
proceeding,
they
would
have
arrived
at
a
value
for
this
building
of
approximately
$185,000,
despite
the
fact
that
here
is
a
man
paying
$2,100,000
for
a
land
only
worth
$660,000.
now,
the
testimony
in
this
case
which
is
undisputed
and
uncontradicted
shows
that
the
same
landlord
sold
an
identical
twin
puzzle
to
another
party
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
the
identical
dimensions
for
$600,000.
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
claim
that
the
petitioner
in
making
the
payment,
this
excessive
payment
over
and
above
the
$660,000
or
$1,440,000,
was
paying
that
amount
of
money
to
be
rate
of
a
burdensome
lease.
why?
the
next
21
years,
this
taxpayer
would
have
been
--
this
lessee
would
have
been
required
to
pay
a
rental
of
two
and
one
half
million
dollars.
and
by
making
this
payment,
he
has
a
valuable
piece
of
land
worth
$660
and
the
balance
is
merely
an
amount
paid
to
save
himself
these
rental
payments
throughout
the
next
21
years.
and
that
is
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
that
was
an
ordinary
--
that
that
item
constitutes
an
ordinary
expense.
it's
an
amount
paid
to
get
rid
of
a
--
the
burdensome
terms
of
a
lease
and
that
it
is
no
different
and
the
rule
should
be
no
different
merely
because
a
purchase
of
land
took
place
at
the
very
same
time
that
the
cancellation
of
the
lease
was
being
work
out
or
paid
off.
mr.
bernard
weiss
the
tax
court
in
its
decision
determined
that
the
petitioner
in
acquiring
the
fee
to
the
land
and
paying
$2,100,000
therefore
did
so
in
order
to
obtain
a
release
in
the
obligations
of
a
lease.
that
language
to
me
can
only
mean
one
thing
and
with
due
deference
to
the
court
below,
this
taxpayer
cannot
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
a
third
party
and
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
to
treat
this
taxpayer
as
if
he
were
a
person
who
would
have
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
property.
and
in
the
case
of
such
a
person
who
has
no
rights
in
the
property
at
all,
the
basis
of
cause
would
have
been
if
you
are
acquiring
land
with
a
lease
on
it
that
you
would
have
to
take
your
cost
and
allocate
the
value
of
your
cost
between
the
land
and
the
value
of
the
lease.
obviously,
the
landlord
couldn't
sell
that
which
he
did
not
own.
he
did
not
own
the
building.
the
building
was
owned
by
the
lessee
and
he
did
not
have
to
purchase
this
building
again.
he
had
all
the
rights
of
ownership.
he
had,
throughout
the
time
of
the
lease,
he
had
the
right
to
receive
all
of
the
rents.
he
had
the
--
he
had
the
use
of
the
property.
what
did
he
acquire
over
here
except
to
be
relieved
of
the
payment
of
$118,840
for
the
next
21
years.
he
did
acquire
a
capital
asset,
yes,
land.
it
was
only
worth
$660,000.
and
in
view
of
that,
that
is
the
reason
why
we
claimed
in
--
in
the
ordinary
business
parlance,
you'll
always
make
an
investment
to
save
money.
we
are
increasing
the
income
of
this
taxpayer
by
this
expenditure.
how
were
you
doing
it?
not
by
increasing
the
gross
income
which
they
already
have
and
which
will
not
be
disturbed
by
this
purchase,
but
by
eliminating
a
deduction,
an
expense
that
is
a
recurring
expense
for
the
next
21
years.
and
this
amount
of
money
is
being
paid
now
and
it's
just
the
opposite
of
what
took
place
in
the
hort
case
when
the
tenant
paid
hort
to
as
the
landlord
an
amount
of
money
to
get
out
of
burdensome
lease
--
lease.
hort
tried
to
claim
that
this
amount
was
not
taxable
or
should
be
treated
first
out
of
--
he
treated
--
he
sought
to
treat
all
together
as
a
reduction
of
his
cost
of
his
property,
but
the
--
but
this
court
properly
held
that
all
that
was
happening
there
was
that
this
taxpayer
was
receiving
currently
the
rent
that
would
have
been
received
over
a
period
of
years.
and
by
taxing
him
in
this
year,
what
happens
is
that
in
the
subsequent
years,
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay.
he'll
have
that
much
less
income.
in
other
words,
the
rental
payments
would
have
been
--
would
not
have
been
received
by
hort
and
that
is
what
we're
doing.
we're
just
doing
just
as
the
opposite.
we
are
a
tenant.
we
are
caught
in
a
dilemma.
and
as
a
result
of
this
dilemma,
we
are
required
to
make
this
unconscionable
expenditure.
now,
we
claim
if
it
is
--
it
is
possible
that
in
determining
the
value
of
the
land,
there
was
something
said
by
the
court
below,
that
you
must
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
land
has
got
an
improvement
on
it
which
cost
$3
million.
this
value
of
$660,000
means
$6600
of
front
foot
is
only
a
little
piece
of
land,
100
by
200.
it
takes
into
consideration
the
fact
that
an
adequate
improvement
is
going
to
be
put
on
that
land.
and
in
fact
that
is
on
that
land,
then
that's
what
that
$660,000
represents.
and
therefore,
the
only
logical
thing
in
this
case
would
be
to
do
one
of
two
things,
either
to
allow
the
whole
thing
in
the
one-year,
in
the
year
of
payment
as
was
done
in
the
cassatt
case
and
the
denholm
&
mckay
case
and
as
was
--
as
was
done
in
the
cleveland
allerton
case
or
in
the
alternative.
it
might
be
better
taxwise
and
that
maybe
accounting-wise
and
for
the
public
revenue
to
say
that
pro
rata
over
the
period
for
which
--
which
will
be
benefited
by
this
expenditure
that
an
aliquot
amount
should
be
taken
and
deducted
on
each
of
the
subsequent
years.
that
is
the
second
proposition
contended
for
by
this
petitioner
in
the
alternative
that
the
amount
and
there's
nothing
new
about
this
type
of
a
contention.
i
have
quoted
a
number
of
cases
in
this
--
in
my
brief,
the
miller
case
and
the
hamlin's
trust
case
which
had
the
--
had
a
situation
where
the
landlord
was
buying
out
the
interest
of
the
tenant.
we
had
a
major
of
title.
a
--
a
minor
interest
in
real
estate
was
being
absorbed
by
the
major
interest.
nevertheless,
the
law
has
been
and
still
is
that
that
amount
of
money
paid
to
buy
out
the
interest
of
this
tenant
even
though
you're
cancelling
the
lease
is
to
be
written
off
over
the
time
of
the
cancelled
lease
or
there
are
some
cases
now
which
take
the
same
sum
and
write
it
off
over
a
new
lease
that
may
have
been
given
to
somebody
else
when
they
cancelled
out
the
other
lease.
but
there,
these
two
--
this
is
nothing
new
and
it's
not
unreasonable.
it's
not
unfair
to
the
revenue,
but
to
come
in
and
attempt
to
say
that
this
taxpayer
is
going
--
is
being
treated
fairly
by
attempting
to
come
in
with
some
ridiculous
basis
that
this
man
would
be
paying
$2,100,000
today
for
a
depreciated
building,
21
years
hence,
and
then
take
the
--
the
discounted
value
of
that
amount
of
money
and
say
that
that
is
the
figure
that's
to
be
written
off
over
the
next
30
years.
i
think
that's
just
plain
ordinary
months.
and
while
the
court
below
did
not
go
into
this
face,
it
is
not
aware
of
this.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
talking
to
--
to
the
general
counsel's
office
and
official
to
the
treasury
department
that's
how
they
construe
this
language.
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
were
forced
to
take
this
case
in
here
against
the
better
judgment
of
the
taxpayer
himself.
if
he
was
one
to
be
dealt
within
that
manner,
he
thought
that
the
right
place
to
do
is
to
decide
what
is
the
law
in
this
situation
and
that's
why
we're
here.
and
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
take
a
--
a
recess
and
give
the
other
side
a
chance
to
say
something
on
this
subject
and
then
i'll
come
back
on
when
--
mr.
bernard
weiss
that's
right.
it
was
the
value
of
the
fair
--
it
was
the
value
of
the
land
as
if
vacant
and
unimproved,
but
that
was
the
terms
of
your
lease.
it
must
be
remembered.
that's
how
they
were
supposed
to
figure
it
out.
and
an
identical
puzzle
of
land
which
happen
to
be
vacant
owned
by
the
same
owner
were
sold
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
that
man
testified
in
this
case
and
he
also
set
the
fair
rental
value
at
$40,000
for
our
property.
and
he
said
he
would
have
been
happy
to
receive
between
35
and
$40,000
as
a
net
rental
on
his
property
at
a
very
moment
that
this
thing
was
happening.
mr.
bernard
weiss
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
makes
the
slightest
bit
difference.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
taxpayer
own
--
owned
the
building.
he
owned
it
under
by
agreement
here
for
its
useful
life
and
its
useful
life
was
--
was
50
years
originally,
20
--
20
had
expired,
at
least,
30
remained
under
the
agreed
facts.
so
there
was
no
necessity
for
this
taxpayer
to
go
out
there
and
buy
that
which
he
owned
and
had
the
right
to
use.
he
was
now
coming
in
there
when
we
talk
about
a
value
of
$660,000
and
that
it
must
be
remembered
that
under
the
terms
of
the
lease,
the
rent
was
fixed
at
6%
of
the
value
of
the
land
vacant
and
unimproved.
it
would
have
been
$40,000
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
this
minimum
cost
was
in
there
requiring
this
taxpayer
to
pay
$118,840.
and
it
was
to
be
relieved
of
this
amount,
this
excessive
rent
that
the
taxpayer
was
forced
to
acquire
the
property.
and
in
acquiring
the
property,
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
when
you
acquire
a
capital
asset,
it
must
be
set
up
as
a
capital
asset
but
to
say
that
you
--
you
are
requiring
a
--
that
i
would
go
out
and
actually
buy
something
which
i
already
own
is
ridiculous.
on
its
face,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
make
the
slightest
bit
of
sense.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
was
--
there's
an
argument
in
here
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
because
before
we
lose
the
trend
here,
there
is
a
statement
then
here
to
the
effect
that
the
income
would
be
distorted
if
we
allow
this
full
deduction
in
the
one
end.
now,
every
time
you
make
--
under
the
ordinary
case
which
they
even
--
which
the
respondent
concedes
when
you
cancel
a
lease
and
you
make
a
payment,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
you
are
distorting
the
income
for
that
year
because
it
will
be
deducted
in
that
year,
it
won't
be
deducted
thereafter.
that
--
that's
the
natural
or
nothing
and
i
say
that
it
will
give
no
harm
to
the
respondent
at
all
if
this
taxpayer
were
allowed
even
the
full
amount
in
the
one
year
which
would
only
mean
that
the
taxpayer
would
have
no
deductions
in
this
subsequent
years
and
the
government
would
--
and
the
commissioner
would
then
be
collecting
the
tax
or
in
the
alternative
to
take
the
period
that
is
benefited.
this
excess
value
above
the
660
is
entirely
due
to
the
lease
and
to
nothing
else.
if
it
weren't
for
this
lease
and
the
taxpayer
had
no
building
on
it,
he
could
then
have
gotten
a
renewal
like
that.
and
the
--
the
man
just
wouldn't
go
in
for
the
thing.
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense.
and
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
--
of
the
court
actually
saying
that
this
taxpayer
who
is
out
with
this
money,
this
excess
value,
should
not
be
entitled
to
get
this
whole
figure
of
$1,440,000
either
as
an
expansive
for
or
to
be
written
off
over
the
period
that's
going
to
be
benefited
because
this
lease
had
21
more
years.
here,
the
unexpired
portion
of
the
lease
had
21
more
years
to
run.
that
is
the
amount
of
the
deduction
that
will
be
absent
from
the
tax
return
which
he
would
have
had
--
had
the
--
had
the
lease
continued
and
therefore,
the
commission
who
is
collecting
the
tax
throughout
this
period
of
$118,000.
now,
if
you
want
to
be
accounting-wise,
it
might
make
sense
to
say
that
this
$1,440,000
should
be
written
off
and
be
place
in
there
in
lieu
of
this
$118,840
and
which
would
give
the
taxpayer
roughly
$68,000
a
year
to
be
written
off
over
the
21-year
remaining
life
of
an
unexpired
life
of
a
cancelled
lease.
and
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
it
does
makes
broad
sense
that
this
taxpayer
should
be
permitted
to
deduct
this
amount
of
money
and
this
business
about
a
reflationary
interest
or
valuing
even
land.
when
a
person
purchases
land
for
$660,000
and
places
a
building
thereon
for
$3
million,
there
is
no
authority
anywhere
which
says
that
because
you'll
now
have
a
building
on
it
that
you
have
a
right
to
take
any
part
of
the
cost
of
that
building
and
transfer
it
over
to
the
land
and
increase
the
value
of
the
land
and
that's
what
is
being
contended
for
by
the
commissioner
on
this
case.
and
that
is
the
mistake
that
the
court
below
is
making
when
it
makes
that
statement.
what
it
really
is
trying
to
say
is
that
you
take
into
consideration
the
use
to
which
this
property
can
be
put
the
maximum
use
and
the
rental
value
that
--
that
surrounds
this
property.
that's
what
he's
trying
to
say
and
when
we
place
a
value
$660,000
on
this
thing
by
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
--
one
of
the
greatest
real
estate
experts
that
was
on
the
stand
in
this
particular
case,
he
knew
this
property
backwards
and
forwards.
you
have
the
man
on
the
stand
in
here
who
have
dealt
in
over
$190
million
worth
of
property.
this
man
knew
all
the
property
in
the
neighborhood
and
knew
exactly
what
the
values
were
and
how
these
values
are
determined.
and
to
say
that
this
taxpayer
should
be
penalized
on
some
technical
language
of
--
by
the
use
of
the
words
bundle
of
rights.
what
--
what
is
the
bundle
of
rights
that
this
taxpayer
received
outside
of
the
fact
that
he
got
out
of
this
lease?
he
already
had
the
use
of
the
property,
the
gross
income
he
was
getting,
an
outsider
who
acquires
an
interest
in
this
property.
what
does
he
do?
he
--
first
is
he
has
no
--
in
the
first
place,
he
has
no
investment.
he
has
no
right
to
receive
the
income.
an
outsider
would
have
received
income
if
he
acquired
this
lease.
do
we
receive
any
income
by
reason
of
that?
no,
we
don't
receive
income.
we
merely
eliminate
an
expense
and
that
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
case
of
the
--
the
hypothetical
case
that
was
cited
by
the
respondent's
counsel.
i
think
i've
said
enough.
