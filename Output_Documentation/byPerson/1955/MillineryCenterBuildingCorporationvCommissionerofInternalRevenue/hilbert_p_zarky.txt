mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
the
court
please.
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
this,
this
taxpayer
in
purchasing
the
property
for
$2,100,000
had
necessarily
paid
some
value
for
the
improvements
on
the
property.
because
the
record
contained
no
evidence
and
because
there
were
no
findings
by
the
tax
court
as
to
how
much
of
that
purchase
price
was
properly
and
fairly
allocable
to
the
building,
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
tax
court
for
proper
determinations
of
value.
and
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
is
that
that
value,
whatever
it
maybe,
maybe
deducted
by
the
taxpayer
in
a
way
of
depreciation
deductions
or
the
remaining
useful
life
of
the
building,
30
years.
that
decision,
we
submit,
is
absolutely
correct
as
a
sensible
decision.
the
court
was
quite
correct
in
rejecting
the
taxpayer's
primary
argument
that
it
was
entitled
to
deduct
in
one
year
as
a
business
expense,
their
difference
between
the
value
of
the
bare
ground
unimproved
and
the
$2,100,000
which
had
paid
for
the
property.
in
its
ultimate
aspects,
this
case
is
really
one
of
where
taxpayer
has
acquired
the
capital
asset.
by
that,
i
mean
an
asset
which
will
give
benefits
flowing
over
a
long
period
of
time.
the
benefits
will
not
be
exhausted
in
one
year.
it's
a
cardinal
principle
of
tax
law
that
when
you
acquire
an
asset
of
that
nature,
if
the
asset
is
an
exhausting
asset,
an
asset
which
will
ultimately
come
to
an
end
in
its
useful
life.
you
will
deduct
over
the
period
of
that
life
a
proportion
amount
of
what
you
paid
for
it.
now,
that's
sensible
and
it
results
in
a
fair
reflection
of
income
because
it
certainly
would
distort
a
taxpayer's
income,
sometimes
take
as
advantage,
sometimes
take
as
disadvantage
to
be
able
to
deduct
in
full
in
the
first
year,
the
full
cost
of
an
item
which
will
result
an
income
being
earned
in
future
years.
and
it's
fair
to
the
taxpayer
and
a
revenue
alike
to
insist
that.
as
the
income
is
being
earned
from
the
use
of
this
asset,
you
deduct
or
match
against
the
income
of
each
future
year
that
aliquot
part
of
the
cost
of
that
item.
and
we
submit
that
that's
this
case,
pure
and
simple.
this
taxpayer
now
owns
to
be
simple
without
any
strings
attached
to
it
a
building
having
a
useful
life
of
30
years.
during
the
next
30
years,
this
taxpayer
is
going
to
earn
income
from
that
building.
and
against
that
income,
it
will
deduct
whatever
values
are
found
by
the
tax
court
to
be
that
part
of
the
purchase
price
that
went
into
the
building,
a
proportion
amount
each
year.
the
taxpayer's
insistence
that
it's
entitled
to
deduct
in
the
first
year,
the
difference
between
what
it
paid
for
the
property
and
the
bare
ground's
value
unimproved
which
was
the
position
of
sixth
circuit
took
in
cleveland
allerton,
we
think
is
mistaken
and
then
demonstrably
sold.
in
cleveland
allerton,
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
taxpayer
here
attempts
to
analogize
its
position
to
that
of
a
lessee
who
pays
to
get
out
from
under
a
lease
and
then
all
connection
with
the
property.
now,
the
principle
is
also
clear
that
such
a
lessee
is
entitled
to
deduct
in
the
year
when
he
terminates
his
lease
whatever
he
has
to
pay
to
get
out
from
under
it
having
severed
all
connection
with
the
property
that
payment
is
the
end
of
the
road
and
he
deducts
at
that
year.
now,
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
the
cleveland
allerton
analysis
and
the
taxpayer's
analysis
here.
it
first
assumes
that
everything
paid
to
the
landlord,
the
fee
owner,
over
and
above
the
bare
value
of
the
land
is
necessarily
a
payment
to
get
rid
of
a
lease.
i
hope
to
demonstrate
that
that
can't
be
sold.
and
the
second
mistake
is
in
thinking
that
even
if
it
were
or
even
if
at
some
part
of
the
payment
were
paid
to
get
rid
of
the
lease,
it
could
be
deducted
in
one
year.
let
me
first
turn
to
the
proposition
as
to
whether
such
a
payment
is
one
to
get
rid
of
a
lease.
the
taxpayer's
argument
emphasized
and
we
think
it
gets
it
into
an
error,
the
fact,
that
it
had
a
record
of
the
building,
it
had
paid
the
cost
of
construction
and
it
had
title
to
the
building.
therefore,
the
argument
runs,
everything
we
pay
over
and
above
the
value
with
the
land
can't
be
paid
for
the
building,
it
must
be
paid
for
something
else.
and
that
something
else
is
to
get
rid
of
the
lease.
well,
this,
we
submit,
confuses
title
to
the
building
with
ownership
of
the
building.
the
lessee
had
title,
it's
true,
but
in
order
to
enjoy
the
use
of
the
building,
the
tenant
had
to
observe
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
not
the
lease
of
this
was
to
pay
rent
each
year.
this
taxpayer
could
only
use
this
building
by
paying
$118,000
a
year
rent
and
it
had
to
pay
so
for
--
to
use
this
building
for
the
next
30
years.
it
would
have
cost
it
his
rent
some
$3,500,000
over
the
next
30
years.
but
by
buying
the
property,
it
no
longer
has
that
obligation.
i
think
i
can
illustrate
what's
wrong
with
the
assumption
by
an
easy
example.
take
the
lessee
who
comes
to
the
landlord
and
says,
i
want
to
get
out
from
under
this
lease.
you
--
you
keep
the
property
as
you're
entitled
to
do
under
the
terms
of
the
lease
when
the
lease
comes
to
an
end
whether
at
the
end
of
the
term
or
prematurely
and
i'll
pay
you
whatever
i
have
to,
to
get
out
from
under
the
lease.
that's
the
first
tenant.
the
second
tenant
says
to
the
landlord,
“i
want
the
building.
i
want
to
own
the
building.
i
want
to
pay
you
for
it.
what
do
you
take?”
now,
i
submit
that,
just
common
sense,
that
if
the
landlords
when
they
get
the
building
and
end
the
lease,
he's
going
to
exact
much
less
to
let
the
tenant
out,
then
the
landlord
who's
going
to
transfer
full
ownership
and
possession
to
the
--
to
the
lessee
who
now
becomes
the
owner.
so
that,
obviously,
the
difference
paid
between
the
bare
value
with
the
ground
and
what's
paid
to
acquire
ownership
in
possession
in
its
full
sense
is
different
than
what's
paid
to
get
out
from
under
a
lease.
let
me
pause
at
this
moment
to
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
to
indicate
that
this
lease
is
owner
as
to
the
taxpayer.
the
only
evidence
and
the
only
finding
that
relate
to
value
is
what
the
experts
testify
as
to
what
the
land
was
worth
unimproved
and
without
the
lease.
now,
that's
either
just
the
beginning
or
completely
irrelevant
but
it
doesn't
touch
on
the
values
that
the
taxpayer
had
to
pay
for
it
to
acquire
ownership.
we
don't
know
what
this
building
is
worth
in
its
improved
state.
we
don't
know
what
it
could
be
rented
for
in
an
arms-length
transaction
without
the
lease.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
admitted
evidence
that
would
touch
on
the
value
of
this
property
is
a
statement
given
on
cross-examination
which
is
not
in
the
printed
record
in
this
court.
it
was
before
the
tax
court
which
indicates
that
the
taxpayer
put
a
mortgage
of
$1,900,000
on
the
property
for
which
it
paid
$2,100,000.
so
that
even
if
the
mortgage
were
90%
of
the
value
with
the
property
which
showed
that
the
$2,100,000
was
fair
market
value
but
that,
of
course,
is
not
a
question
for
this
court.
that's
the
problem
that
the
tax
court
will
be
faced
with
on
a
remand.
but
the
one
sure
thing
is
that
the
taxpayer
ought
not
to
be
able
to
deduct
in
one
year
this
amount
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
paid
to
get
rid
of
an
onerous
lease
when
it's
based
on
the
false
assumption
that
anything
over
the
bare
value,
bare
the
value
of
that
bare
ground
was
something
the
taxpayer
didn't
have
to
pay
for.
it
had
to
pay
for
the
property
if
it
wanted
to
go
into
possession
without
paying
any
future
rent.
it's
going
to
save
that
$3,500,000
over
the
next
30
years.
its
income
to
that
extent
will
be
increased
and
it
will
have
one
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
a
matching
deduction
each
year
for
that
part
of
the
value
which
it
paid
for
the
building.
we
assume
--
we
--
we
submit
that
the
case
can't
be
any
clearer
or
any
fairer
in
its
tax
results.
the
taxpayer's
alternative
proposition
is
that
if
it's
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
full
difference
between
the
bare
ground
value
and
the
value
of
the
building,
at
least,
it
should
amortize
it
over
the
rest
of
the
period
of
the
lease
instead
of
over
30
years,
the
useful
life
of
the
building.
now,
again,
we
submit
that
that
would
not
be
the
proper
tax
treatment.
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
saying
that
you
must
allocate
this
over
the
30
years,
the
useful
life
of
the
building.
of
course,
to
the
extent,
you
paid
value
for
the
building
that's
what
period
of
the
time
you're
going
to
get
the
tax
benefits
and
that's
the
period
of
time
through
which
you
should
take
the
deductions.
obviously,
the
remaining
unexpired
period
of
the
lease
here
has
no
significance
for
two
reasons.
it
bears
no
necessary
relationship
to
what
the
taxpayer
acquired.
assume
what
the
--
if
you
will,
the
change
of
facts
in
this
case
where
the
taxpayer
renewed
the
lease
only
one
month
before
it
purchased
the
property.
and
i
may
--
may
interject
to
say
that
that
certainly
may
have
some
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
it
paid
full
value,
whether
it
was
getting
out
of
an
onerous
lease
when
he
had
one
month
before
had
renewed
the
lease
a
full
21-year
period.
but
let's
change
the
facts
and
say
that
one
month
before
the
renewal,
the
taxpayer
had
bought
the
property.
that
is
when
there's
only
one
month
of
the
original
term
left.
if
the
taxpayer
were
right
in
saying
that
the
rule
should
be,
it's
entitled
to
deduct
this
amount
whatever
it
may
be
or
the
remaining
period
of
a
lease,
it
would
have
a
deduction
in
that
one
year
because
only
one
month
was
left
to
the
lease,
when
in
fact,
it
now
owns,
in
its
fullest
sense,
a
building
which
it
didn't
own
before
it
acquired
full
ownership
by
paying
the
purchase
price
which
was
demanded.
so
that
we
think
that,
as
its
stands,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
unsalable.
i
should
make
only
one
more
observation
of
the
taxpayer's
observations
about
some
conversations
that
we've
had
with
internal
revenue
service
about
value.
as
i
take
it,
whatever
those
conversations
were,
they
do
not
represent
the
government's
position,
ultimate
position.
they
were
made
in
the
course
of
negotiations
for
a
settlement
of
the
case.
whether
they're
correct
or
incorrect,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
know
this
that
i
would
hate
to
make
a
determination
of
value
on
the
record
in
this
case
when
most
if
not
all
of
the
ultimate
relevant
facts
had
not
been
introduced
into
the
record.
and
without
knowing
what
the
value
of
the
building
was,
what
its
rental
value,
sale
value
or
any
other
factor
which
would
determine
how
much
of
this
$2,100,000
went
to
acquire
the
use
of
the
building
without
the
added
information,
i
say,
i
don't
think
anyone
could
has
it
or
guessed
as
to
what
deductions
attached,
they
will
be
entitled
through
over
the
next
30
years.
