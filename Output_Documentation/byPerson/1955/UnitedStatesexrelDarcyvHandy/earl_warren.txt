was
that
from

chief

that
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
matter
away
from
the
jury
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that
the
jury
could
not
possibly
hear
what
was
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
margiotti,
the
thing
--
one
thing
that's
bothering
me,
all
of
these
things
were
known
apparently
to
or
must
have
been
known
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
during
the
trial
of
the
case.
did
they
raise
these
questions
on
appeal?

why?

earl
warren

not?
chief
justice
earl

shouldn't
they
appeal?

justice
earl
warren
shouldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
were
done
in
open
court
and
were
known
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel,
should
they
not
had
been
raised
on
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
they
--
if
they
did
--
did
they
make
objection
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
i
thought
i
read
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
the
lawyer
who
was
present
chancellor
of
the
bar
of
that
state
represented
this
defendant
on
his
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
wouldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
raise
those
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long

year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1951?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1948?
chief
justice
earl
warren
three

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
the
district
court
find
against
you
on
that?

justice
earl
warren

did
the
district
attorney
have
to
say
about
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
about
all
anyone
could
say,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughter]
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
judge
--
but
the
judge
found
that
--
that
your
allegation
was
not
found
incidentally.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
so
about
that,
yes.
chief
justice
earl

in
the
courtroom.
is
there
any
