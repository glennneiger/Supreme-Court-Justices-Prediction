mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
yes,
your
honor.
please
your
honorable
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
third
circuit
of
pennsylvania
in
which
a
decision
of
board
of
three
--
by
a
decision
board
of
three,
a
decision
of
the
district
court
refusing
the
petitioner
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i'll
the
give
the
court
some
history
of
the
case
only
as
it
pertains
this
particular
matter
because
the
killing
in
the
case
occurred
in
december
of
1947,
the
particular
petition
giving
rise
to
this
appeal
was
not
filed
until
april
of
1951
and
prior
to
that
time
means
--
other
--
other
appeals
have
been
taken
to
the
supreme
court,
the
matter
had
come
to
this
court
too,
under
the
(inaudible)
case
and
there's
no
necessity
in
going
into
that
history
unless
the
court
is
interested
and
if
it'd
be
hard
--
had
the
--
for
i'll
answer
any
particular
question
that
is
asked.
so,
i'll
begin
particularly
with
the
filing
of
the
petition.
a
petition
was
filed
before
his
honor,
judge
murphy
of
the
middle
district
to
pennsylvania
at
scranton.
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
although
served
with
the
copy
of
the
petition,
did
not
file
an
answer.
in
that
petition,
for
the
first
time
were
raised
three
important
questions,
all
based
upon
the
fact
that
was
claimed
by
the
petitioner
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
in
violation
of
--
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
those
facts
were
not
facts
that
appeared
on
the
record
at
the
time.
the
court
had
a
transcript
of
the
proceeding
of
the
trial.
but
there
was
nothing
before
the
court
on
the
very
questions
that
were
raised
of
the
petition.
as
i
said,
the
commonwealth
filed
no
answer
to
that
petition
and
fixed
the
--
the
judge
fixed
the
date
for
a
hearing
or
for
argument
rather,
and
i
was
required
to
go
from
pittsburg
to
scranton
by
automobile,
encountered
an
unexpected
detour
that
took
me
a
little
more
time.i
was
late
20
minutes.
when
i
got
to
court
i
found
that
the
judge
had
decided
the
case
and
had
--
had
denied
the
writ
without
any
answer
filed
on
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
to
the
various
allegations
of
the
petition.
and
then
after
--
and
he
wrote
an
opinion.
and
after
the
opinion
was
filed,
about
a
week
or
two
after
the
opinion
was
filed,
the
commonwealth
filed
an
answer,
nunc
pro
tunc,
in
connection
with
the
petition.
there
was
an
appeal
taken
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
on
that
occasion
by
a
decision
of
four-to-three,
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
same
judge
to
hear
the
facts
on
issues
raised
by
the
averments
of
the
petition,
although,
denied
by
the
commonwealth.
and
so,
we
proceeded
to
a
hearing
before
his
honor,
judge
murphy,
the
same
judge,
which
lasted
about
eight
days
in
which
much
testimony
was
taken.
at
the
time
the
first
petition
was
filed,
it
was
contended
by
us
by
the
petitioner
that
the
defendant
had
received
an
unfair
trial
in
this
regard.
that
he
was
not,
while
he
had
counsel,
although
counsel
had
been
employed
by
his
father,
that
counsel
paid
no
attention
to
the
case
and
interviewed
of
about
a
half
hour.
and
that
--
that
he
did
not
prepare
the
defense,
didn't
introduce
any
defense,
told
the
defendant
he
was
not
required,
not
going
to
take
the
witness
stand
and
he
made
the
decision
for
the
defendant
although
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
on.
didn't
introduce
any
character
evidence,
evidence
was
available.
and
didn't
introduce
any
psychiatric
test
upon
that
question
was
involved.
so,
we
raised
the
question
at
the
--
the
trial
was
a
sham
trial
with
no
defense
at
all.
we
also
raised
the
question,
he
was
tried
in
a
--
a
--
an
atmosphere
of
his
theory
and
that
he
could
possibly
get
a
fair
trial
under
the
circumstances.
and
furthermore,
that
a
judge
who
had
tried
two
codefendants
on
the
case,
judge
boyer,
had
been
guilty
of
such
misconduct
as
to
deprive
the
defendant
and
petitioner
of
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
well,
then
that
case
was
disposed
of
by
the
circuit
court.
they
returned
us
to
the
same
judge
to
present
the
facts.
they
eliminated
the
question
of
the
ability
of
the
trial
lawyer,
the
defense
lawyer,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
really
gave
to
this
defendant
a
--
a
fair
trial
himself,
now,
whether
he
had
--
act
as
a
lawyer
should
do
on
his
behalf.
now,
the
only
reason
i'm
quoting
that
is
because,
while
they
eliminated
that
question,
we
took
out
all
evidence
on
that
question
at
the
hearing
before
judge
murphy.
and
yet
in
the
opinion
that
followed
from
which
we
have
appealed,
they
refer
several
times
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
a
good
trial
lawyer.
that
his
lawyer
didn't
do
this
and
his
lawyer
didn't
do
that.
and
so,
in
one
instance,
when
we
raised
the
question,
we're
told
we
can't
raise
it.
and
when
we
don't
raise
it
they
say
he
was
a
good
lawyer.
and
so
he's
out
of
the
question.
i
am
only
calling
that
to
your
attention
because
that
question
may
arise
during
the
course
of
this
argument.
and
we
confined
ourselves
to
the
two
questions
which
is,
of
course,
that
it
was
the
mandate
of
the
circuit
court
required
us
to
follow.
and
that
was
first,
whether
there
was
such
a
--
such
a
--
such
prejudice
to
us
to
do
the
exterior
in
the
community
that
deprived
the
defendant
of
an
unfair
--
of
a
fair
trial.
and
second,
the
misconduct
if
any
of
the
so-called
--
of
the
so-called
misconduct
of
judge
boyer
who
had
tried
the
previous
case.
and
so,
the
evidence
was
presented
around
these
two
questions.
now,
in
order
to
make
my
position
clear,
i'll
give
you
only
a
short
statement
of
the
facts
just
enough
to
know
what
the
killing,
how
the
killing
occurred.
the
defendant
was
22
years
of
age
up
until
the
time
he
admit.
three
other
defendants
had
borne
a
very
good
reputation
and
had
been
a
good
boy.
he
was
a
son
of
a
tipstaff
of
a
court
in
philadelphia,
judge
brack's
tipstaff
and
he
had
been
mentally
afflicted
and
had
some
mere
trouble,
but
he
met
with
this
bad
company.
and
they
engaged
in
some
robberies,
several
of
them,
maybe
10
or
15.
i
don't
remember
the
exact
number
prior
to
this
particular
one.
on
this
occasion
while
he
was
at
home,
asleep,
they
went
awakened
him
and
he
went
with
his
companions
to
the
scene
of
the
killings.
now,
what
happened
there
was
that
they
went
in
to
an
inn
called
the
feasterville
inn
--
feasterville's
inn.
there
they
held
up
a
bartender
and
rifled
the
cash
register.
there
were
some
shots
fired
on
the
inside
but
nobody
was
killed.
and
--
although
someone
died
years
later
beyond
the
statute
of
limitations.
however,
i
have
pointed
the
year
and
the
day
afterwards
whether
he
died
as
the
result
of
the
shot
or
not,
i
don't
know.
but
that's
not
involved
in
the
case.
but
as
the
four
were
leaving
the
feasterville
inn,
the
zeitz,
the
leader
of
the
organization,
driving
the
automobile
with
his
one
hand
on
the
car
and
the
other,
he
fired
a
shot
out
the
window
and
he
shot
at
a
bystander
named
kelly
and
killed
him.
the
defendant
was
in
the
car
at
the
time.
now,
he
had
participated
in
the
robbery
and
participated,
of
course,
getting
away
from
there,
that's
what
he
was
doing
at
the
time.
and
under
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
a
killing
that
occurs
in
perpetration
of
robbery,
is
murder
of
the
first
agree.
and
furthermore,
the
jury
hearing
the
case
has
the
duty
to
fix
the
penalty
if
they
find
a
person
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
either
a
death
or
life
imprisonment.
and
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
the
record
so
far
as,
i
think,
that
is
someone
--
some
witness
testified
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
shot
into
the
floor
or
shot
in
the
direction
of
somebody.
but
you
mean
in
the
inn
--
it
--
at
the
inn,
not
outside
the
inn,
no.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
no,
he
did
not
shoot
at
the
man
at
the
bar.
the
record
does
--
does
not
show
that
he
shot
at
anybody.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
i
--
i
know
you're
asking
--
asking
me
that
question.
i
know
from
talking
to
him
that
he
told
me,
he
shot
into
the
floor.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
but
that,
i
don't
know
whether
that's
in
the
record
or
not.
i
don't
think
it
is.
because
he
didn't
take
the
stand
and
that's
what
he
would
have
said
if
he
have
taken
the
stand.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
fright
--
frightening
other
bystanders
who
were
going
toward
them
to
stop
them
from
coming
toward
--
but
he
did
not
shoot
at
any
individual
and
he
was
not
--
did
not
shoot
the
man
that
was
killed.
at
least
the
person
whom
he's
tried.
now,
furthermore,
in
pennsylvania
where
four
--
where
two
or
more
persons
are
charged
with
murder,
indicted
with
murder,
they
have
--
the
right
of
severance
is
given
to
them
as
a
matter
of
right
to
the
question
of
discretion
in
the
court
at
all,
a
matter
of
right
just
to
protect
the
defendant.
in
this
particular
case,
our
question
came
up.
the
judge
expressed
the
opinion
that
he
hoped
that
they
wouldn't
ask
for
such
a
severance
because
it
would
cause
the
county
an
awful
lot
of
money
and
to
take
a
lot
of
time,
and
said
so
in
open
court
at
the
time
the
matter
was
heard.
but
at
any
rate,
it
was
insisted
that
there
was
a
severance.
and
so
there
was
severance
granted
and
the
defendant
obtained
a
trial
by
himself.
so,
they
put
the
first
persons,
call
for
trial,
were
two,
foster
and
zeitz.
now,
zeitz
is
the
man
who
fired
the
shot
and
the
four,
of
course,
foster
did
not
fire
any
shots
at
all
but
he
was
in-company
with.
and
they
were
tried
together.
and
immediately
thereafter,
bear
in
mind,
not
a
week
or
two
afterwards,
but
the
very
next
trial
there,
after
the
result
of
the
first
case,
this
defendant
was
put
on
trial.
that
the
trial
terminated
on
friday.
they
couldn't
try
him
on
saturday
or
sunday,
but
they
put
up
on
trial
on
monday
morning,
june
the
4th.
june
4th
was
the
date
and
he
--
when
the
trial
began
--
or
june
the
7th,
pardon
me.
now,
the
--
we
showed
at
the
time
of
the
--
in
our
hearing
to
show
our
prejudice
and
feeling.
we
showed
evidence
from
publications
of
newspapers
both
daily
and
weekly
newspapers.
bucks
county
is
a
county
that
has
small
communities
in
it.
doylestown,
i
believe,
is
the
largest
but
doylestown
and
bristol
are
probably
the
largest
towns
in
it.
and
most
of
the
county
is
rural.
and
there
are
numerous
--
there
are
several
daily
papers,
the
one
daily
paper
of
several
weekly
papers.
but
the
philadelphia
metropolitan
paper,
the
county
is
next
to
philadelphia,
circulate
quite
freely
in
bucks
--
in
bucks
county.
now,
we
showed
by
publication
that
there
was
much
publicity.
that
the
people
of
the
county
had
become
indignant
over
this
killing.
and
i
can
understand
it
because
of
the
nature
of
the
crime.
and
that
they
referred
to
them
as
bandits
and
trigger-happy
boys
and
thugs.
they
were
boastful
and
they
were
callous.
they
were
holdup
men.
they
were
gangsters.
they
particularly
referred
to
them
as
being
philadelphians
and
they
had
not
business
crossing
county
lines
and
coming
into
bucks
county
where
decent
people
lived.
they
were
hard
boiled
and
many
statements
of
that
kind.
and
then,
there
were
many
editorials
calling
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
people,
the
duty
of
jurors
in
cases
of
this
type,
what
they
were
required
to
do.
and
showing
that
in
many
instances
jurors
were
with
these
and
would
not
perform
their
duty.
and
complementing
jurors
who
did
perform
their
duty.
and
there
were
--
there
were
radio
--
radio
statements
and
television
shows
for
the
put
on
and
there
were
in
addition
to
--
to
this
publicity
we
called
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
they'd
put
television
pictures
of
--
pieces
of
pictures
of
the
individuals
or
some
television
accounts
of
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
and
that's
what
i
mean.
i
didn't
mean
of
the
particular
case.
that
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
and
that's
one
of
the
things
i
complain
about
the
other
lawyer.
and
they
say,
why
didn't
he
ask
for
a
change
of
venue.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
what's
that
your
honor?
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
i
think
he
should
have
been
under
the
circumstances
just
as
your
honor
apparently
is
asking
questions.
the
--
and
as
the
--
the
majority
opinion
here
says
that
they
should.
substantially
that
too,
and
i'll
come
to
that,
your
honor.
now,
the
--
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
of
foster
and
zeitz
issued
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
was
charged,
told
the
jury
that
in
his
opinion
the
evidence
warranted
the
death
penalty,
murder
of
the
first
degree
and
the
death
penalty.
that
was
his
--
his
conclusion,
his
--
his
opinion
but
of
course
at
the
end
left
the
finding
to
the
jury.
and
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
first
--
this
trial
of
foster
and
zeitz.
and
that
was
published,
your
honor.
that
was
published
just
before
our
trial
began.
in
addition
to
that,
and
this
is
very,
very
serious,
when
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
on
friday,
the
judge
in
open
court
praised
the
jury.
now,
he
told
the
jury
that
he
couldn't
see
how
they
could
have
rendered
any
other
kind
of
a
verdict
and
it
was
a
proper
verdict.
now,
what
made
matters
worse,
the
daily
paper
published
to
that
--
that
community.
in
headlines
and
big
headlines
heralded
the
story,
"judge
praises
death
verdict."
i
call
that
to
your
attention
in
order
to
show
that
this
was
part
of
judge
boyer's
conduct.
this
is
the
beginning
of
something
that
i'm
going
to
follow
up
with
because
it
involves
his
participating
in
the
trial
of
the
petitioner.
and
that's
the
reason
it's
important.
now,
the
philadelphia
--
the
philadelphia
bulletin
on
june
the
8th,
which
is
the
second
day
of
the
darcy
trial
that
--
which
was
the
day
when
the
jury
was
finally
selected
issued
a
--
wrote
a
--
carried
an
article
complimenting
the
--
the
jury
of
doylestown
in
bucks
county
for
having
rendered
a
verdict
of
murder
of
the
first
degree
and
showed
it
was
an
--
vindication
for
women
being
on
the
jury
because
there
were
some
women
on
the
jury.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
am
relying
on
reversal
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
in
this
case,
the
--
on
the
fact
that
the
--
on
the
totality
of
the
evidence
involved
in
the
case,
a
reading
of
the
two
opinions,
the
majority
opinion
and
the
minority
opinions.
the
minority
opinions,
which
are
very
strong,
one
by
judge
kalodner
and
one
by
judge
biggs,
the
chief
judge.
both
--
both
expressions,
i
think,
a
reading
of
those
two
opinions.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
it's
--
it's
more
important
than
listening
to
all
our
arguments.
i
think
you
can
get
it
right
from
those
two
opinions,
and
i
mean
that.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
except
one
thing.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
mean
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
mean
the
entire
picture.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
mean
the
entire
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
no.
i
--
i
don't
mean
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
don't
mean
that
i
mean
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
mean
--
i
mean
this
--
this
question
of
the
--
of
the
publicity,
the
prejudice
that
existed.
that
plus
the
conduct
of
the
judge.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
no
question.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
--
i
do,
principally,
your
honor,
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
no,
i
mean
as
to
what
--
when
you
asked
me
whether
this
is
true
in
my
case.
i
meant
to
say
that.
see
that's
what
i
meant
with
that
answer.
i
think
that's
correct
but
i'm
--
i'm
about
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
i
-
i'm
going
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i'm
satisfied
that
i'm
going
to
get
to
it
and
get
to
it
in
plenty
of
time,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
and
now,
in
addition
to
all
these,
we
called
numerous
witnesses,
preachers
and
businessmen
and
doctors
and
others,
people
in
all
walks
of
life
to
testify
that
they've
heard
in
the
community
that
the
testimony,
that
the
--
the
men
ought
to
be
hanged.
that
they
should
be
hangup
like
rats.
that
they
should
be
--
they
should
not
receive
any
--
any
trial
at
all.
that
they
ought
to
shot
and
all
sorts
of
expressions
of
that
kind.
now,
there
was
no
contradiction
as
to
the
publicity.
there
was
no
contradiction
as
to
these
statements
by
--
that
appeared
in
the
newspaper
about
the
trial
judge.
and
there
was
no
contradiction
of
the
witnesses
who
testified.
the
commonwealth
relied
simply
on
the
question
that
all
this
did
not
amount
to
something
that
they
--
they
--
did
not
amount
to
some
violence
that
we
had
not
shown.
that
there
were
gatherings
of
persons
who
were
armed
or
who
had
threatened
to
go
to
the
jail
or
go
to
the
courtroom
and
raise
a
disturbance.
and
we
haven't
showed
any
disturbance.
and
that's
the
only
answer
there
was
to
all
that.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
now
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
we
go
to
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
your
honor
please.
the
best
answer
to
that
will
be
in
the
opinions,
now
and
i'll
come
to
that
and
everything.
because
this
--
there's
a
lot.
there
are
four
volumes
here
and
a
lot
of
time
could
be
taken
up
but
i
think
i'll
go
right
to
the
findings
of
the
majority
opinion.
and
i
think
probably
that's
--
that's
the
best
thing
for
us.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
just
what
i've
said.
the
--
the
--
they'd
found
--
absolutely
said
that
the
--
there
was
no
hostility.
that
there
was
no
--
no
threats
of
violence
and
that
there
were
no
mobs.
that
there
were
no
gatherings.
there
was
no
violence
exhibited
and
based
his
opinion
on
that.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
not
at
all.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
now
--
now,
here
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
what's
that,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
oh,
he
found
the
trial
was
fair.
he
found
the
trial
was
fair
even
without
the
commonwealth
filing
an
answer,
your
honor,
because
in
the
first
opinion
when
we
had
alleged
the
same
things,
--
where
is
this?
oh,
here.
now,
here's
the
--
like
i
call
your
attention,
your
honor,
to
page
1248,
volume
4
of
the
--
of
petitioner's
transcript
of
the
record.
he
said
that
the
--
the
circuit's
or
the
court
says,
"that
most
it
indicates
that
during
two
weeks"
and,
of
course,
we
contend
that
all
these
feeling
became
more
intense
because
it
published
all
the
testimony
of
the
case
during
the
other
trial,
and
was
done
during,
just
immediately
before
the
defendant
was
put
on
trial.
that
--
that
most
it
indicates
that
during
the
two
weeks,
immediately
preceding
the
relator
trial,
the
community
in
general,
had
experienced
a
revival
and
quickening
of
interest
in
the
homicide
attended
by
many
expressions
of
indignations
against
its
perpetrators.
but
it
does
not
appear
that
feeling
ran
so
high
that
hostility
towards
the
relator
was
so
intense
and
so
general
as
to
make
it
seem
incredible
that
the
search
for
a
satisfactory
jury
would
yield
12
persons
as
open
minded
about
this
case
as
the
juries
here
claimed
to
have
been.
the
situation
certainly
would
have
justified
a
decision
to
wait
a
while
before
trying
the
relator
and
i've
asked,
your
honor,
judge
--
judge
minton
and
--
or
else
to
try
him
in
another
community
if,
justice
minton
pardon
me,
if
trial
immediately
after
conviction
of
his
confederates
was
deemed
important.
we
may
be
persuaded
that
in
the
circumstances
it
would
have
been
wise
to
take
such
precautions.
if
not
convinced,
the
failure
to
follow
up
that
the
wiser
course
was
a
denial
of
the
absence
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
that
--
that
was
what
the
--
what
the
majority
of
the
--
the
majority
opinion
said
on
that
question.
and
the
--
judge
kalodner
didn't
refer
to
that
at
all
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
judge
biggs
--
and
judge
biggs'
opinion
he
said
which
is
not
very
long
but
very
short
into
the
point,
said
darcy
was
tried
--
darcy
was
tried
--
darcy's
trial
was
so
distorted
by
circumstances
both
in
and
out
of
the
courtroom
has
to
result
in
the
fundamental
--
in
fundamental
unfairness.
the
brutal
crime
committed
by
darcy,
foster,
zeitz
and
capone
had
angered
the
citizens
of
bucks
county
by
editorials,
new
stories
and
comments.
the
press
prejudiced
darcy's
case
and
prejudiced
the
minds
of
the
citizens
that
were
against
them.
i
cannot
believe
that
all
members
of
the
jury
remained
uninfluenced
by
these
publications.
so,
darcy
had
been
granted
a
separate
trial.
the
service
was
worthless
when
it
was
proceeded
with
only
three
days
after
the
--
that
this
proceeding
was
only
three
days
after
the
other
trial.
now,
then
that's
what
was
said
on
the
question
of
publicity.
now,
comes
the
question
of
the
conduct
of
the
judge.
and
that
is
probably
the
most
important
thing
in
this
case.
judge
boyer,
by
the
way
in
that
--
in
that
county,
they
do
not
wear
robes.
at
least
they
weren't
at
that
time.
there
were
two
judges,
judge
boyer
had
tried
the
foster-zeitz
case
and
judge
keller
was
trying
the
defendant.
and
the
--
judge
--
judge
boyer
was
a
well
respected
citizen.
he'd
been
elected
twice.
he'd
been
district
attorney
of
the
county.
he'd
been
appointed
district
attorney
and
elected
district
attorney
and
he's
a
pretty
well
known
citizen
there.
undoubtedly,
he
carried
a
great
deal
of
weight.
now,
his
statements
about
the
guilt
of
the
defendants
and
particularly
where
you
have
a
question
of
the
--
the
death
penalty
being
warranted
in
both
whether
the
--
whether
the
individual
fired
the
shot
and
where
the
individual,
the
other
defendant
did
not
fire
the
shot
and
we
were
trying
--
they
were
trying
the
case
at
the
time
of
a
defendant
who
had
fired
no
shot.
that
would
have
some
bearing,
we
believe,
on
--
on
the
jury
if
they
knew
the
--
the
judge's
feelings.
however,
here's
what
occurred.
the
judge
during
the
darcy
case,
entered
the
courtroom
and
he
sat
on
the
bench
with
the
trial
judge.
now,
several
times
and
engaged
in
whispered
conversations.
nobody
could
tell
what
they
were
whispering
about.
and
i
contend
that
that's
far
worse
because
the
jury
could
imagine
almost
anything
under
those
circumstances.
whispered
conversations,
on
one
occasion,
he
participated
in
a
ruling
and
that's
part
of
the
record.
it's
referred
to
in
the
record.
he
--
he
sat
then,
participated
in
the
ruling.
it
was
a
side
bar
matter
and
mr.
achey,
who
was
trying
the
case
for
the
defendant,
objected
his
conduct
and
to
his
participating.
and
he
said,
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
his
language
was,
"i
don't
mind
trying
this
case
against
one
judge
but,"
and
then
he
was
cutoff.
and
judge
boyer
said,
"well,
we
judges
--
we're
not
required
to
obtain
counsel's
permission
to
confer
among
ourselves.
we're
not
required
to
have
your
permission
to
do
that."
and
he
remained
on
the
bench.
and
he
came
on
the
bench
during
the
trial
of
this
case
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
that
was
definitely
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
your
honor
the
record
so
--
so
shows
for
the
jury
is
sitting
by
although
this
is
somewhere
like
where
those
pilars
are.
the
jury
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
your
honor,
it
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
was
right
at
the
bench
sidebar,
in
pennsylvania
it's
called
the
--
is
referred
to
--
means
a
--
a
ruling
or
an
action
of
the
court
which
counsel
participate
in,
in
low
tones
of
voices
so
that
the
jury
don't
hear
what's
going
on
but
it's
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
your
honor,
they
were
not
raised
on
appeal
until
the
petition
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
was
filed.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
i
was
not
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
didn't
get
into
that
case
until
--
until
this
petition
was
filed
until
shortly
before
this
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
it
seems
to
me
they
should
have
--
someone
should
have
raised
these
questions.
they
should
have
done
it.
but
i'm
not
responsible
to
the
fact
that
they
didn't
raise
them,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
mr.
achey
is
dead.
and
we
took
the
position
that
mr.
achey
wasn't
--
did
not
try
this
case
properly.
and
i
don't
like
to
argue
that
question
because
that's
not
before
us.
but
we
raised
that
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
(inaudible)
that's
the
reason
i
referred
to
him
a
little
while
ago.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
he
did,
that
was
mr.
mcbride
and
a
very
fine
lawyer
whom
i
know
person
and
know
favorably.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
a
very
good
lawyer.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
but
he
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
he
asked
of
that
question.
he
said
he
didn't
look
into
it
and
that
it
was
not
called
to
his
attention
by
mr.
achey
who
had
tried
the
case.
and
the
questions
he
raised
is
what
he
found
on
the
record
and
what
mr.
achey
called
to
his
attention.
and
this
was
not
called
to
his
attention
by
mr.
achey.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
reason,
your
honor.
and
--
but
they
were
raised
just
as
soon
as
--
soon
as
i
get
into
the
case.
i
had
it
investigated
along
that
line,
raised
just
as
soon
as
they
possibly
could
raise
them
and
there
is
no
question
about
that
there
were
plenty
of
notice.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
--
the
case
was
tried
in
--
i
don't
know
the
--
the
killing
occurred
in
1947.
i
found
the
petitioner
the
day
before
my
birthday
so
that
means
that
i
didn't
have
--
it
was
april
the
3rd,
almost
fell
on
april
1st
but
it
didn't.
[laughs]
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
what?
1951.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
1951.
the
case
was
retried
in
1948.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
now
--
now
then,
this
judge
not
only
participated
in
this
particular
ruling
but
he
came
on
the
bench
several
times,
several
sessions.
and
it's
the
--
the
test,
the
record
is
full
of
testimony.
that
he
remained
there
from
10
or
15
minutes
to
half
hour
or
an
hour
and
at
times
would
occupy
a
seat
opposite
to
where
the
jury
over
in
that
side
and
over
here
on
this
side,
there
was
a
place
with
some
chairs
over
there
where
he
was
in
full
view
of
the
jury.
and
he
sat
right
there,
had
a
night
session
even.
and
they
so
--
they
so
find
in
the
decision
--
in
the
opinions
of
the
--
of
the
circuit
court.
so,
i'm
--
i'm
quoting
from
them
in
addition
to
their
testimony.
and
in
full
view
and,
of
course,
i
take
it
that
the
--
the
justice,
judge
hasty
who
rendered
the
majority
opinion
said
that
he
didn't
think
that
--
that
the
judge
had
done
any
harm.
and
until
--
unless
he
had
done
some
harm,
there
was
a
--
there's
no
reason
why
that
that
conduct
would
come
within
the
prohibition
of
the
due
process
clause,
they
say.
and
judge
kalodner
take
--
takes
the
--
but
that
he
said,
if
there
had
been
evidence
of
a
note
passing,
it
was
our
contention
that
a
note
had
passed
at
the
end
of
the
charge
from
the
judge
to
the
district
attorney.
had
the
district
attorney
after
receiving
this
note
that
this
was
all
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
stood
up
before
the
court
and
raised
some
objection
to
the
court's
charge
at
that
time.
we
had
to
take
and
met.
that
was
our
position.
that
they
said
if
there's
--
if
there
after
the
lower
court
had
found
that
as
fact,
that
would
have
been
different.
we've
been
considered
and
would
have
brought
it
within
the
prohibition
of
the
due
process
clause.
judge
kalodner
in
writing
the
minority
opinion
says,
that
there
was
enough
in
the
record
itself
up
to
that
time
to
show
he'd
done
something
that
was
wrong,
called
attention
to
the
--
turn
to
the
publications
of
his
opinion.
he's
praising
the
jury
that
the
death
penalty
which
was
the
right
thing
to
do
just
before
this
trial
occurred.
how,
his
standing
in
the
community,
how
they
would
look
to
him
and
how
they'll
be
--
how
would
they
--
they'd
be
influenced
by
it.
the
fact
that
he
came
into
court,
sat
on
the
bench.
they
would
look
at
him
and
watch
him
for
some
help
or
guidance
just
like
they
were
the
judge
himself
who's
trying
the
case.
and
that
he
participated
in
the
trial.
and
that
was
a
prejudicial
act
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
irrespective
of
--
of
the
note
passing
incident.
that
--
but
i
claim
that
the
evidence
was
so
strong
on
the
note
passing
incident
that
should
have
been
found
in
our
favor
and
i'll
come
to
that.
and
so,
if
you
look
in
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
on
page
--
on
page
--
may
i
call
your
attention
to
page
1133
(a)
which
is
a
map
introduced
by
the
commonwealth
to
show
the
--
what
the
--
how
the
room
was
constituted.
it
will
show
where
judge
boyer
sat
at
night.
or
when
he
--
one
night
when
he
came
in,
that
was
friday
night
before
the
charge.
his
name
is
--
is
written
there
at
the
chair.
and
you'll
observe
the
jury
box
is
--
is
to
the
very
left,
right
opposite
that.
and
--
but
across,
everything
else
that
appears
in
the
courtroom
of
a
--
except
benches.
and
on
page
--
and
as
an
examination
of
page
1
--
1121,
that
gives
you
a
picture
of
the
--
no
--
it
gives
you
a
picture
that
shows
the
jury
box
and
shows
the
chair
where
judge
boyer
sat
on
friday
night.
and
it's
our
contention
that
he
sat
there
during
the
charge
on
page
1121
(a).
and
now,
we
called,
your
honor,
three
witnesses.
miss
ford,
who
is
sitting
on
the
bench,
eight
feet
away
from
judge
boyer,
miss
gordon,
not
related
to
any
of
the
parties,
but
friendly
to
miss
ford
and
miss
--
and
joe
darcy
a
brother
of
the
--
the
petitioner
and
(inaudible)
a
sister
of
the
petitioner.
i
--
three
of
them
testified.
the
two
women
gordon
and
ford
testified.
and
while
they
were
seated
there,
at
the
end
of
the
charge,
they
observed
that
biester,
the
district
attorney
was
seated
alongside
of
the
judge,
not
had
his
usual
place
which
was
the
commonwealth's
table
but
alongside
of
judge
boyer.
they
observed
him,
give
--
raise
his
hand,
judge
boyer
lays
his
hand
and
pass
a
note
to
mr.
biester,
whereupon,
mr.
biester
read
it
and
he
proceeded
from
that
direction,
made
his
way
to
the
bench
at
the
end
of
the
charge
and
at
that
time
made
some
comment
or
some
objection
to
the
court
about
the
charge
which
i'll
refer
to
later.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
he's
--
he's
dead.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
am
not
from
that
county,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
and
i
imagine
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
but
at
least,
here's
the
gentleman
--
the
district
attorney
doesn't
know.
i
don't
either.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
all
right.
but
he
died
prior
to
this
hearing,
your
honor.
i
can
tell
you
that.
at
least
that's
what
i
was
told.
now
then,
these
two
--
these
two
--
these
witnesses
testified
that
that
had
occurred.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
he
--
the
court
did
and
i
take
the
position,
your
honor,
on
that
point
that
where
the
evidence
is
not
uncontradicted
and
there's
no
and
it's
reasonable,
not
unreasonable
and
it
does
not
come
from
a
corrupt
source
and
there's
no
other
circumstance
to
show
that
it's
not
worthy
of
belief
that
the
district
--
that
--
that
the
court
is
bound
by
that
testimony
because
of
some
controversy.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
i
tell
you
what
the
district
attorney
had
to
say
about
it.
the
district
attorney,
who
is
now
a
judge,
testified
when
came
to
this
situation,
i
do
not
recollect
whether
it
occurred
or
not.
and
he
also
testified
that
when
was
he
certain,
he
would
say
it
was
certain
and
he
was
not
certain
he
was
going
to
say
i
didn't
recollect.
that
was
the
district
attorney.
and
he's
the
judge.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
that
those
things
don't
happen
everyday.
i've
tried
cases
for
many,
many
years.
i've
never
had
a
judge
or
anybody
pass
or
of
the
matter,
a
judge
pass
me
a
note
about
a
judge's
charge.
and
if
it
did,
it'd
be
impressed
upon
my
mind
because
it
doesn't
happen
now
everytime
i
go
into
court.
that
--
that
would
be
an
impressive
matter.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
would
hand
me
a
note
now,
your
honor,
i'd
remember
it
for
a
long,
long
time.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well,
that's
what
he
said
and
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
that's
correct.
he
found
out,
your
honor,
but
he
said
because
it
was
contradicted.
but
it
wasn't
contradicted.
i
say
that,
that
was
not
a
contradiction
because
that's
non-negative
testimony
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
well
that's
our
position
there.
then
in
addition
to
that,
we
call
joe
darcy
who
is
a
brother
of
the
petitioner,
who
said
the
same
testimony
except
the
fact
that
he
had
observed
that
the
judge
had
leaned
over,
his
table
in
front
of
them
and
written
out
the
note.
the
other
two
witnesses
had
not
observed
that,
which
in
my
mind
was
evidence
that
they
were
telling
the
truth.
and
then,
recall
the
sister,
mrs.hackman,
who
sat
a
little
further
away.
she
hadn't
observed
that
incident
at
all.
and
that
she
didn't
testify
to
anything
worthwhile.
now,
the
thing
that's
important
too,
your
honor
is
this,
when
this
judge
testified
to
this,
and
biester
testified,
he
didn't
recollect,
i
asked
them
whether
or
not
he
did
get
up
and
whether
they
did
get
before
the
court.
and
he
said
they
did.
i
asked
them
if
the
court
had
anything
--
had
asked
them
if
he
had
admitted
anything
from
his
charge
to
call
his
attention.
and
that
mr.
achey
had
said,
"none,
your
honor,"
and
that
he
remained
silent.
he
said
he
did.
i
said,
"well
when
did
you
make
up
your
mind
that
you
were
going
to
do
what
you
did
do."
all
he
says,
"i
can't
tell
this,
i
can't
rationalize
my
memory."
well,
i
said,
"let's
see
now,
you
--
you
objected
to
what
was
said
concerning
second
degree
and
first
degree
murder
in
flight
or
unintentional
killing,"
"yes."
well,
i
said,
"when
would
you
make
up
your
mind
to
make
an
objection
of
that
kind?"
why,
he
says
immediately
after
i
heard
her.
well,
he
had
heard
it
long
before
that
because
it
came
long
before
that
as
is
shown
in
our
record
--
please
turn
to
that
page
--
and
we
have
showed,
pointed
out
in
the
record.
and
if
he
had
that
in
his
mind,
that's
when
he
would
have
done
it
just
at
time
the
judge
made
the
mistake.
or
if
he
didn't
do
it
then
when
the
judge
said,
"do
you
have
anything
to
say?"
he
would
have
gotten
up
and
he
would
have
then
made
his
objection
because
that
was
his
first
opportunity
to
speak
without
interrupting
the
court.
in
place
of
that
when
the
court
asked
him,
he
had
nothing
to
say.
he
said,
nothing
at
all
but
just
sat
there.
now,
the
day
after
that
he
got
up
and
made
his
objection.
now,
something
had
to
happen.
a
nod,
a
prod,
a
touching
of
the
foot,
a
touching
of
the
arm,
something
had
to
happen
that
calls
to
that
lawyer's
attention
to
get
up
there
and
make
that
objection.
and
so
you
have
that
further
fact
to
consider
as
to
whether
or
not
this
--
this
testimony
should
have
been
received
by
the
court
and
he
should
have
rendered
it.
he'd
found
the
facts
as
we
claim
them
to
find
them.
and
i
think
that
by
reading
the
record
as
a
whole,
your
honor,
as
you
go
along,
reading
the
record
and
questions
that
were
asked
by
judge
murphy,
keeping
in
mind
that
he's
the
same
judge,
that
in
this
case
after
i
make
it
a
charge
that
we
did
in
our
petition
originally,
that
he
rendered
a
decision
against
us
and
denied
the
writ
without
even
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and
it
was
the
same
judge
that
was
--
that
made
--
made
the
--
made
the
decision
here,
as
reading
the
record
and
observing
very,
very
carefully
what
the
--
his
--
his
demeanor
and
his
questions
that
he
asked.
it
may
give
you
some
idea
of
whether
what
he
had
in
mind,
i
don't
know.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
he
acted
improperly,
but
i
wish
to
merely
call
those
matters
to
your
attention
because
they're
in
the
record.
so
that
there
--
there
couldn't
be
--
i'm
just
calling
to
my
attention,
your
honor,
that
at
this
time
i
have
about
15
minutes
left,
is
that
right?
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
could
i,
with
your
permission,
your
honor,
refrain
from
proceeding
further
and
reserve
these
13
minutes
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
for
rebuttal?
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
please
may
i
first
set
address
to
time
that
judge
boyer
died.
he
died
august
the
9th,
1951
which
was
sometime
after
we
filed
our
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
petition
set
forth
the
charges
that
are
involved
in
this
present
proceeding
against
his
conduct.
at
that
time
he
was
ill
but
not
too
ill
that
he
couldn't
have
testified
but
there's
no
effort
made
by
the
common
law
to
take
his
deposition
and
in
that
last
illness,
of
course,
he
died
and
during
that
time
petition
was
filed
and
the
commonwealth
filed
an
answer
to
our
petition.
and
there
was
a
decision
by
the
lower
court
in
a
reversal
in
that
meantime.
now,
as
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
your
honor,
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
supreme
court
merely
acted
on
our
petition.
what
we
did,
we
filed
a
petition
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
setting
forth
substantially
the
same
facts
that
are
set
forth
in
the
petition
here
involved
for
the
purposes
of
exhausting
our
state
remedies.
and
the
commonwealth
filed
an
answer,
i
believe,
i'm
not
too
sure
about
that
part
be
that
as
it
may,
on
that
petition
in
answer
to
supreme
court,
refuse
the
hearing
and
never
heard
the
facts.
and
then
of
course
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i
believe
that's
--
i
believe
that
that
is
the
most
important
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
--
point
in
this
case
and
i'm
just
coming
to
that
but
i
want
to
clear
up
some
of
this
early
points.
i
want
to
clear
up
too
about
these
questions
about
abduct
--
a
two
men
court
in
pennsylvania.
there
is
no
such
thing.
i
applied
cases
in
over
half
the
counties
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
both
to
say
private
practitioner
as
attorney
general
and
i've
never
heard
of
the
practice
of
--
of
a
two-judge
court
or
a
three-judge
court
in
the
trial
of
cases,
never,
never
occurred
and
i've
tried
many,
many
homicide
cases
both
for
the
commonwealth
and
for
the
defense,
numerous
cases
and
that
has
never
occurred
in
my
entire
experience.
it's
the
most
unusual
thing.
this
two-man
court
is
a
--
is
locked
at
in
pennsylvania.
it
occurs
in
only
two
or
three
districts
where
we
have
small
counties
and
two
judges
sit
with
the
presiding
judge,
not
one
but
two
and
they're
lay
judges,
farmers,
businessman,
ditch
diggers,
anything
so
long
as
they
can
get
votes
and
they're
called
a
judge
and
we
all
took
fun
at
them.
we
called
them
judge
and
they
liked
to
be
called
a
judge
and
they
enjoy
that
and
all
they
do
is
sign
papers
and
writs
when
the
--
when
the
presiding
judge
is
not
in
the
county
but
in
his
own
county.
he
has
to
come
from
another
county
and
to
those
small
counties
and
they're
only
two
or
three
districts
where
that
occurred
and
they
don't
advise
the
trial
judge
on
questions
of
law
and
before
in
the
to
trial.
they're
consulted
on
the
question
of
silence
and
that's
as
mr.
lawley
had
said.
now,
the
chair
referred
to
where
judge
boyer
sat
has
been
called
a
chair
for
the
tipstaff.
that
is
not
correct.
the
evidence
is
all
to
the
effect
that
that
chair
as
well
as
all
chairs
within
the
railing
like
it
is
in
here
are
set
aside
with
members
of
the
bar,
not
for
a
tipstaff.
and
the
tipstaff,
the
person
in
charge
of
the
jury
sat
on
the
upper
--
other
side.
and
so
far
as
judge
boyer
is
concerned,
that
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
my
opinion
that
that
is
the
most
important
thing
than
my
opinion
is
conduct,
shocks
the
conscience
of
the
ordinary
individual.
i've
never
heard
of
such
conduct.
you
can
search
your
own
minds.
you're
all
experienced
men
in
trial
of
cases
and
hearing
cases
that
you
ever
heard
of
such
conduct
of
a
judge,
particularly
a
judge
could
express
himself
who
had
been
held
as
a
judge
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty
for
these
boys
and
that
had
appeared
in
the
newspapers.
there
isn't
only
one
newspaper
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
those
times,
but
that
newspaper
carried
--
was
a
correspondent
for
the
bristol
newspaper
which
is
the
other
large
town
in
the
county
and
was
published
over
there
and
it
was
carried
over
and
ready.
all
these
facts,
with
that
expression
and
that
feeling
when
they
granted
the
severance
and
when
they
objected
to
the
granting
of
severance
on
some
penny-pinching
justice
idea
that
they
would
like
to
try
these
cases
all
together.
it's
going
to
cost
money
and
they
made
statements
like
that
from
the
bench
and
then
half
of
the
trial
of
the
case
as
judge
made
these
statements
and
there's
no
and
it
was
respected
and
it
was
in
the
court
and
the
acts
of
manner
which
he
did.
there
is
no
question
of
what
this
conduct
was
shown.
now,
what
did
he
do?
he
went
on
the
bench.
they
say,
they
started
out
and
they
put
up
a
trial
balloon
by
taking
the
position
that's
necessary
for
judge
boyer
to
go
on
the
bench
every
morning.
every
morning
in
order
that
they
would
dispose
of
miscellaneous
business,
then
he
would
withdraw
and
go
to
some
other
courtroom
and
wouldn't
appear
again.
well,
that
balloon
soon
was
punctured
and
naturally
punctured
because
it
didn't
stand
under
the
facts.
he
came
back
and
he
participated
in
the
trial
and
what
punctured
it
was
the
record.
and
that
was
the
first
thing
i
had
as
to
his
conduct
when
i
read
the
record
and
i
saw
he
sat
on
the
bench
and
he
participated
in
a
ruling
unfavorable
to
the
defendant.
and
that
--
that
was
a
very,
very
important
ruling
because
it
involved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
testimony
of
previous
misconduct
on
the
part
of
this
defendant
should
be
admitted
as
evidence.
achey
take
the
position,
should
not
--
the
state
taken
the
position,
yes,
it
should
because
that
kind
of
evidence
will
help
the
jury
in
passing
on
the
penalty.
and
they
take
with
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
judge
boyer
advised
that
he'd
be
admitted
and
judge
boyer
--
mr.

that?
mr.

j.
margiotti
he

and
the
chief

mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
yes.
i'd
say
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti

appears
right
in
the
record.
mr.

judge

me
have
it,
would
you
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
your
honor
please,
it
had
to
be
a
whispered
conversation
because
in
pennsylvania

what
we
call
a
"sidebar"
and
that

the
whole
--
everything
what
was
said
by
all
the
parties
and
that
was
taken
down
stenographically
and
thank
god
for
that
because
if
it
hadn't
been
taken
down
stenographically
most
people
would
have
said
i
don't
recall.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
record.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
you'd
know
it
from
the
--
from
--
we
don't
know
it.
so
far
as
--
as
so
far
as
judge
(inaudible)
concerned,
he
testified
that
he,
thereafter,
left
the
bench
but
he
doesn't
say
how
soon
thereafter
he
left
the
bench.
judge
keller
who
was
a
trial
judge
was
brought
into
court
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
to
(inaudible)
from
the
southern
part
of
the
state
to
the
northern
part
of
the
state
and
it
was
in
that
courtroom
as
a
witness,
and
i
thought
they're
going
to
call
him
as
a
witness.
they
refuse
to
call
him
as
a
witness
but
they
presented
a
certificate
in
which
he
stated
what
he
knew
about
the
situation
and
they
introduced
a
certificate.
i
objected
to
it
on
the
ground
that
the
best
evidence
was
a
judge
himself
since
he
was
in
court.
they
refused
to
call
him.
the
court
took
the
certificate.
judge
--
judge
keller
left,
went
back
to
doylestown.
i
was
thinking
of
calling
him
and
i
was
going
to
take
some
risk
in
doing
that
but
being
a
judge
i
was
going
to
call
him
anyhow
but
he
--
when
i
went
to
call
him,
he
was
gone.
and
so
far
as
his
certificate
is
concerned,
you'll
find
it
on
page
--
pardon
me
for
taking
up
a
little
time,
your
honor.
my
--
i
have
a
bad
eye.
i
have
a
kind
of
an
operation,
i
can't
help
--
where
is
it?
the
certificate
is
found
on
page
1133
(a)
and
was
reference
to
this
transaction
in
paragraph
--
in
page
1138
(a).
he
says,
on
several
occasions,
he
says,
during
the
darcy
trial,
the
honorable
kelvin
s.
boyer,
the
additional
law
judge
occasionally
joined
the
undersigned
and
sat
with
them
at
the
beginning
of
several
sessions
of
court,
devoted
to
the
trial
of
a
case
for
the
purpose
of
transacting
miscellaneous
business.
after
which,
he
withdrew
when
the
case
was
in
progress.
on
several
occasions,
however,
judge
boyer
remained
for
brief
periods
while
evidence
was
presented
and
that's
the
judge
himself
who
sat
on
the
bench
and
did
the
ruling.
remaining
for
brief
periods
on
cross-examination,
i
could
have
had
developed
what
those
brief
periods
were
whether
they
were
10
minutes
or
a
half
hour,
what
he
meant
by
brief
periods
and
how
many
they
were,
but
they
didn't
have
them
for
cross-examination.
on
one
of
these
occasions
and
then
he
went
on,
it
goes
on
tells
what
occurred
with
reference
to
that
particular
ruling
that
was
made.
and
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
yes,
there
was
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
there
--
there
was
--
i
know
there
was
evidence
of
that
kind
unless
my
associate
could
pointed
out
for
me,
your
honor.
i
can't
just
quickly
do
it
for
you
but
i'll
do
the
best
i
can
but
while
--
while
i'm
going
to
something
else
that
will
be
done.
but
i
know
that
that
occur
because
it
was
definite
evidence
on
that
particular
subject
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
i'll
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
margiotti
thank
you
very
much.
my
time
is
a
little
too
fast
