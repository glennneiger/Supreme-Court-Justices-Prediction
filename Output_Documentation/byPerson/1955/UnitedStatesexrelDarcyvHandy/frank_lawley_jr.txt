mr.
frank
lawley,
jr.
permission
of
the
court.
but
first,
i'd
like
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
frank
lawley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
lawley,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
i'd
first
like
to
answer
the
question
asked
by
the
chief
justice,
concerning
whether
the
defendant,
david
darcy,
fired
any
shots.
we
have
printed,
in
--
beginning
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
the
facts
of
the
crime
as
recited
by
the
district
court.
at
the
top
of
page
7,
the
district
judge
states
that
during
the
course
of
the
robbery,
darcy
fired
two
shots
and
then
engaged
in
a
scuffle
with
two
--
two
patrons
in
the
bar.
after
--
after
the
conspirators
left
the
feasterville
tavern,
they
continued
on
to
another
tavern
and
committed
another
robbery
the
same
night.
they
were
apprehended
about
1:00
o'clock
in
the
morning
by
the
philadelphia
police.
at
that
trial,
the
defendant
was
represented
by
webster
achey
and
on
appeal
was
represented
by
mr.
thomas
d.mcbride
present
chancellor
of
the
philadelphia
bar
who
is
present
in
court
today.
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
a
continuance
was
granted
to
permit
counsel
time
to
file
a
petition
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
order
to
exhaust
state
remedies.
the
petition
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
making
the
same
allegations
as
here
made
and
it
was
denied
on
april
the
10th.
this
court
later
denied
certiorari.
then
the
case
was
referred
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
judge
refused
without
opinion.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
the
hearing
was
held.
i
would
like
to
state
that
we
can
find
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
the
defense
reasons
who
are
not
testifying
and
the
doctor
and
so
on
as
related
by
mr.
margiotti.
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
the
defendant's
reputation
to
the
fact
that
he
was
mentally
afflicted
or
had
ear
trouble.
there
were
two
persons
shot
inside
