mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
me
the
question
as
to
whether
the
question
of
judge
boyer's
statements
and
actions
had
been
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
the
answer,
sir,
is
yes
and
the
supreme
court
stated
in
its
opinion
that
it
could
find
nothing
in
the
statements
or
actions
to
indicate
anything
prejudicial
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
and
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
whether
the
district
court
made
findings
of
fact.
there
were
two
judges
who
sat
in
the
district
court.
judge
murphy
and
chief
judge
watson
both
conquered
in
the
findings
of
fact
contained
in
judge
murphy's
opinion.
they
stated
that
he
had
failed
to
prove
his
allegations
and
they
concluded
that
he
had
--
that
he
had
received
a
fair
trial.
on
the
first
broad
allegation
of
hysteria
and
prejudice,
darcy
was
represented
at
that
trial
by
experienced
trial
counsel.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
he
knew
in
march
the
trial
was
in
june.
he
knew
in
march
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
commonwealth
to
start
darcy's
trial
immediately
after
that
of
his
coconspirators,
yet
we
find
that
there
was
no
motion
or
change
of
venue
nor
for
a
continuance
and
that
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
in
march,
in
march,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
determining
the
significance
of
the
failure
to
ask
for
a
change
of
venue
or
a
continuance,
we
cite
mr.
justice
clark's
statement
in
stroble
versus
california
wherein
he
stated
that
to
determine
the
significance,
to
determine
whether
there
was
history
and
prejudice,
he
thought
it
was
significant
that
two
deputy
public
offenders
in
los
angeles
had
not
requested
a
change
of
venue.
and
a
similar
statement
is
contained
in
united
states
versus
rosenberg
in
the
second
circuit.
chief
judge
swan
there
stated
that
if
counsel
did
not
realized
the
importance
of
newspapers
at
the
time,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
jury
did
either.
we
have
in
our
brief,
beginning
on
page
39,
charted
the
procedural
facts
of
the
three
cases,
stroble,
rosenberg
and
darcy.
in
the
three,
we
note
that
in
stroble
the
question
was
first
raised
immediately
on
motion
for
a
new
trial.
here,
the
question
was
not
raised
until
present
counsel
raised
it
some
two
years
later.
he
now
makes
a
statement
that
it
was
where
the
court
sua
sponte
to
move
to
change
the
venue.
we
say
that
this
cannot
be
done.
under
pennsylvania
law,
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
of
the
(inaudible)
and
for
the
state
or
for
the
court
to
have
changed
it,
would
have
denied
him
of
this
constitutional
right.
further,
our
constitution
provides
that
the
court
shall
have
the
power
to
change
venue
under
the
provisions
of
the
law.
the
law,
the
statute
states
that
venue
may
be
changed
on
application
of
the
defendant.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
if
--
if
the
defendant
would
raise
the
question,
yes,
we
do
have
the
power
to
change
the
venue
if
the
defendant
feels
that
the
newspapers
are
unduly
exciting
the
people.
here,
there
was
no
manifestation
at
his
trial
that
in
any
way,
shape
or
form,
the
newspapers
had
created
an
atmosphere
of
hysteria
and
prejudice.
there
is
no
situation
here
akin
to
moore
versus
dempsey,
frank
versus
mangum
or
any
of
those.
the
district
court
so
found
and
specifically
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
finding.
there
is
no
showing,
there
is
no
proof
that
the
jury
was
in
fact
influenced
in
anyway
by
any
newspaper
article.
there,
the
proof
is
that
the
jury,
as
a
jury,
after
selection
read
nothing
that
they
were
segregated.
they
were
kept
free
from
access
to
any
forms
of
communication.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
after
the
trial
began
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
kept
together
under
the
supervision
of
four
tipstaffs
and
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
live
in
a
hotel,
took
their
meals
in
a
group
and
they
were
in
the
--
under
the
supervision
of
these
persons
at
all
times.
they
were
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
not
to
read
papers,
no
radio,
television
or
anything
else.
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
judge
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
that
would
have
been
on
friday
or
saturday
prior
to
june
7.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it
--
it
would
have
been
available,
yes,
sir.
may
i
point
out
that
first
there
is
no
proof
that
they
did
in
fact
read
it.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
intelligence,
sir,
has
a
circulation
or
did
have
at
that
time
of
approximately
5000
in
a
county
of
over
100,000
population.
next,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
printed
the
voir
dire
examinations
of
the
jurors
printed
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
record
today
is
the
same
as
it
was
on
--
in
june
of
1948
as
to
what
the
jurors
did
read.
there's
no
proof
that
they
read
anything
more
or
anything
less
than
what
is
contained
in
their
voir
dire
examinations.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
don't
believe
there
were
challenges
for
a
cause.
there
were
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
use
10
of
the
20
allowed
by
law.
the
peremptory
challenges
were
no
exhausted.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir,
if
at
the
time
they
did
not
know
that
he
would
be
present
at
all
in
the
courtroom
other
than
counsel
would
know
that
he
will
be
present
in
the
morning
in
the
opening
of
court
and
if
i
may
i'll
explain
that
just
a
little
later
on
in
my
argument.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
going
to
go
into
it.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
point
out
further
the
question
of
hysteria
and
prejudice
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal.
when
counsel
--
when
trial
counsel
was
assisted
by
thomas
d.
mcbride,
the
present
chancellor
of
the
philadelphia
bar.
as
to
the
articles
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
on
appeal,
sir.
he
was
not
trial
counsel.
the
trial
counsel
was
mr.
achey,
who
is
dead
and
mr.
power
and
they
were
engaged
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
mr.
mcbride
took
it
up
in
association
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
the
end
and
then
mr.
margiotti
took
over
from
there.
if
i
may
serve
--
serve
the
papers
themselves,
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
the
newspaper
articles
were
factual
in
nature.
the
editorials
to
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
refer,
there
were
nine
during
the
period
upon
which
he
relies.
in
point
of
time,
they
range
from
three
days
after
the
crime
until
a
day
before
the
trial.
only
two
of
these
refer
to
the
defendants
and
then
the
reference
is
indirect.
the
allegation
here
is
that
there
was
an
out
of
court
campaign
to
secure
the
death
penalty
for
the
defendants.
we
say
it
is
difficult
to
determine
how
there
was
such
an
out
of
court
campaign
in
view
of
the
fact
that
exhibit
42
contained
on
page
998
(a)
of
the
record
concludes
that
if
these
defendants
are
sent
away
for
impressive
periods,
it
should
discourage
forays
into
the
county.
if
--
we
submit
--
if
it
was
an
evidence
of
a
campaign
to
get
the
death
penalty,
the
statement
to
send
away
for
impressive
periods
has
no
--
no
meaning.
further,
the
editorials
refer
to
professional
jurors
in
philadelphia,
they
refer
to
crime
in
general
but
there
is
no
campaign
proved.
there
has
been
no
campaign
proved
to
secure
a
death
penalty
for
these
persons.
his
--
in
--
in
fact
in
main,
his
argument
is
that
the
adjectives
used
in
the
story
were
prejudicial
to
the
defendant.
the
facts
as
to
these
adjectives
that
they
were
bandits
and
so
on
came
out
at
his
trial
as
they
did
in
stroble
versus
california.
there
the
adjectives
used,
we
submit,
where
much
worst
and
much
more
widespread
because
we
were
dealing
there
with
metropolitan
papers
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
where
a
werewolf,
fiend,
sex
mad
killer
and
so
on.
the
facts
came
out
at
the
trial
and
this
court
held
--
affirmed
the
judgment
in
that
proceeding.
he
further
states
--
petitioner
further
states
that
there
was
an
alleged
feeling
in
the
community
against
these
people,
against
these
defendants.
he
stated
yesterday
that
i
call
witnesses
from
all
walks
of
life
to
show
this.
seven
witnesses
were
called.
there
was
an
aunt
of
one
of
the
conspirators.
there
was
the
sister
of
darcy,
(inaudible),
an
attorney
for
zeitz
who
is
now
dead,
a
friend
of
the
family,
a
doctor
who
examined
darcy
and
who
wrote
a
letter
to
the
governor
seeking
clemency
and
two
preachers.
the
testimony
of
these
persons
as
the
district
court
found
was
not
oriented
as
to
time,
as
to
place,
or
the
person
on
--
in
our
attempt
to
bring
it
out
from
whom
they
heard
this,
we
clearly
unsuccessful.
they
could
not
say
when
they
heard
it,
where
they
heard
it
or
from
whom
they
heard.
but
even
so,
reverend
damroach
stated
that
even
under
the
facts
that
he
heard
he
was
not
willing
to
say
that
there
was
prejudice
against
these
people
and
that's
contained
in
the
record.
and
reverend
babinski,
at
the
time
when
the
hysteria
and
prejudice
was
supposed
to
be
sweeping
the
county,
after
this
heist
trial,
he
stated
that
there
were
no
expressions
of
threats
or
violence
and
that
there
was
no
change
of
feeling.
there
was
indignation,
yes
and
we
submit
that
there
would
be
a
strange
community
where
there
would
not
be
in
the
indignation.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
from
the
countryside,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
jurors
answers
on
the
voir
dire
contained
in
our
appendix,
we
submit,
indicated
that
there
was
no
fixed
opinion.
this
court
has
held
that
the
mere
reading
of
the
newspapers
alone
does
not
disqualify
and
that
there
was
no
indication
that
they
would
not
decide
this
case
on
the
facts
and
the
evidence
presented.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
jury
was
out
several
hours.
sir,
we'll
get
that
reference
and
i'll
give
that
to
you
before
i
sit
down.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
that
is
possible,
sir.
i
--
i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
and
in
pennsylvania
they
determine
not
only
the
guilty
essence,
the
degree
but
also
the
penalty
when
it
is
murder
case.
the
fact
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he
pleaded
not
guilty,
sir,
but
the
entire
proceeding
is
an
indication
that
there
was
an
attempt
only
to
save
him
from
the
chair.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
present
counsel
on
page
7
of
this
brief,
states
that
he
did
engage
in
a
robbery
and
while
fleeing
a
person
was
shot
and
under
the
law
of
pennsylvania
that
is
murder
in
the
first
degree.
so
that
the
question
was
for
the
--
as
to
the
penalty
alone
and
mr.
farrier,
an
attorney
for
our
for
our
coconspirators
stated
in
the
district
court
that
he
got
into
the
case
solely
with
the
idea
of
saving
zeitz
or
saving
his
client
from
the
chair.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
on
page
28
of
our
brief
in
a
footnote,
we
set
forth
the
statement
as
to
mr.
achey
as
--
as
contained
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court.
in
addition,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
also
found
that
mr.
achey
was
a
good
lawyer
and
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
when
they
send
it
back
for
hearing
on
the
question
of
hysteria
and
prejudice
specifically
stated
that
you
could
not
go
into
the
question
of
the
counsel,
the
--
the
competency
of
this
man.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it
was
unfounded,
yes,sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
five
of
them
did,
five
of
the
seven.
justice
biggs
or
judge
biggs
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
believe
that
two
of
them
judge
biggs
and
judge
mclaughlin.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
think
they
all
agreed
that
the
affidavits
of
juror
should
be
stricken
form
the
record.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
darcy
selected
the
counsel
and
then
you
had
his
counsel
within,
i
think,
five
days
after
the
crime.
he
was
represented
by
his
own
counsel,
darcy's
family
selected
the
counsel
and
he
was
represented
by
this
man
from
the
time
of
the
five
--
shortly
after
the
crime
until
the
time
of
trial
and
thereafter,
a
period
of
six
months
or
more
after
the
trial
--
he
still
continue
to
represent
it.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he
had
two
lawyers,
mr.
power
as
the
--
as
evidence
indicated
in
the
court
below
in
the
district
court,
mr.
power,
although
a
younger
man
had
considerably
experience
and
was
a
good
trial
lawyer.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
judge
--
judge
biggs
and
judge
mclaughlin
felt
that
they
should
be
alive
to
go
into
the
question
as
to
the
adequacy
of
counsel
upon
remand.
the
five
--
the
--
the
remaining
five
did
not.
they
found
affirmatively
that
the
record
indicated
that
he
had
been
adequately
represented
and
they
cited
justice
minton's
opinion
in
weber
versus
ragen
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir
they
did.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
margiotti
yesterday
mentioned
the
question
of
tv.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
evidence
of
tv
coverage
that
we
stipulated
in
the
district
court
as
to
the
only
films
presented.
darcy
was
on
the
screen,
ten
seconds.
the
group
of
the
four
defendants
was
on
the
screen,
15
seconds.
other
than
that,
there
is
no
showing
of
any
other
tv
coverage.
there
is
no
showing
of
the
number
of
--
of
tv
sets
back
in
1947.
there
is
no
showing
that
any
of
the
jurors
had
tv
sets.
in
short,
there
may
have
been
coverage
of
a
--
of
a
slight
amount
in
connection
with
the
news
story
but
certainly
nothing
that
would
create
any
hysteria
or
prejudice.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
prior
to
trial,
the
arrest,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
picture
was
shown
either
in
the
end
of
december
of
1947
or
in
january
of
1948
and
the
trial
was
not
until
june.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
december
23rd,
1947.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
either
immediately
after
the
testimony
is
somewhat
conflicting.
either
immediately
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
or
in
january
of
1948.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
film
itself
was
not
accompanied
by
any
sound.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
was
said.
there
--
there
is
an
indication
that
it
was
shown
in
philadelphia
at
the
time
when
the
officer,
the
police
officer
who
apprehended
this
individual
received
an
award,
a
medal
so
to
speak.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it
was
taken
outside
of
a
--
of
a
courthouse
or
a
jail
as
i
recall
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
after
their
arrest
but
in
any
event
was
published
to.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
oh,
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i'm
getting
to
judge
boyer
right
now,
sir.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
that
he
died
prior
to
the
district
court
hearing.
the
same
and
as
i
stated
before
the
same
question
were
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
further
that
on
direct
appeal
this
counsel
did
not
raise
any
question
as
to
judge
boyer.
the
district
court
found
that
the
allegations
concerning
him
had
not
been
proved.
mr.
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
uncontroverted
facts
concerning
judge
boyer
i
believe
to
be
this.
first
that
the
morning
sessions
and
the
afternoon
sessions
when
court
convened
he
was
on
the
bench,
the
reason
for
that
is
it
was
the
practice
in
bucks
county
at
that
time
that
prior
to
the
start
of
any
trial
or
what
was
going
on
in
that
courtroom,
they
had
a
miscellaneous
session
where
there
were
motions
rule
to
show
cause
and
so
on.
the
evidence
says
that
sometimes,
immediately,
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
miscellaneous
session,
he
left
the
bench.
in
other
times,
judge
keller,
the
presiding
judge
stated
that
he
remained
on
the
bench
and
listened
to
the
evidence.
the
uncontroverted
evidence
further
is
that
at
onetime
--onetime
during
the
trial
he
did
participate
at
sidebar
in
a
ruling
on
evidence
on
a
difficult
question
as
characterize
by
the
trial
judge,
the
difficult
of
question
of
evidence.
it
was
at
sidebar,
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
it
was
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
they
--
they
conferred
and
it
is
on
the
trial
record
that
he
did
make
a
statement
to
counsel
and
counsel
objected
after
which
judge
boyer
withdrew
from
the
bench.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
objected
to
him
participating
in
the
ruling
and
he
withdrew
and
--
and
left
it
back.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it's
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it's
803
of
the
original
record,
sir.
it's
contained
in
this
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
it
is
also
on
the
trial
record
and
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
what
--
what
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
what
we
mean
by
a
sidebar
in
pennsylvania.
let
us
assume
that
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
black
were
sitting
alone.
at
anytime
in
pennsylvania,
when
we
desired
to
converse
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
counsel
for
both
sides
approach
the
bench
and
in
some
cases
lean
over,
the
court
reporter
if
necessary
comes
up
and
puts
his
machine
or
invoked
on
the
bench.
then
the
conferences
held
either
a
emotion
or
an
argument
on
the
question
that
it's
on.
the
--
upon
the
conclusion
then
you
come
back
into
open
court
and
again
speak
in
such
tone
that
the
jury
can
hear
it.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he
--
he
left
the
bench,
i
mean
that
he
went
out
of
the
bench,
went
off
to
the
bench
and
either
into
his
chambers
or
into
another
courtroom,
the
evidence
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
both
judges
where
on
the
bench
at
that
time,
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
then
the
evidence
says
judge
keller
statement
under
the
22
--
section
2254.
his
state
was
that
judge
boyer
left
the
bench
and
that
no
other
time
in
the
trial
assisted
him
in
the
conduct
of
the
case.
that
was
the
evidence
and
that
was
--
as
it
was
found
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i'm
going
on,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
further
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it
was
against
him.
they
--
they
admitted
--
they
admitted
it
but
the
question
was
never
raised
--
the
ruling
was
never
challenged
on
appeal
by
anybody.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
correctness
of
ruling
is
not
challenged
even
today.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
certain
counties
--
may
i
--
may
i
it
put
it
this
way.
historically,
in
oyer
and
terminer
courts,
it
was
required
there
would
be
two
judges.
some
of
our
statutes,
old
statutes
provide
that
in
certain
counties
you
had
to
have
two
judges.
today,
in
counties
where
there
is
not
a
separate
judicial
district
where
the
population
is
small
so
that
one
judge
serves
two
counties.
it
is
required
that
there
be
a
lay
judge,
not
learned
in
the
law,
a
lay
judge
who
also
must
sit
with
the
--
what
judge
learned
in
the
law
to
conduct
a
trial.
the
--
there's
a
reference
to
it
in
our
brief,
an
article
by
president
judge
(inaudible)
the
former
president
of
pennsylvania
bar
association
wherein
he
details
the
history
of
two
judges
presiding
at
a
trial.
further
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
--
the
old
statutes
requires
that
it
be
done
in
--
in
capital
cases
in
certain
counties.
they
have
been
so
--
so
as
they
wiped
out
with
the
exception
of
the
counties
wherein
the
judge
is
not
sitting
in
that
county
alone.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
in
bucks
county
one
judge
is
all
that
is
necessary.
there
is
no
prohibition
for
having
more
than
one
judge.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
judge
keller
was
the
presiding
judge.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
as
i
recall
judge
boyer's
remark,
sir,
he
said
something
that
he
knew
nothing
that
would
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
as
i
recall,
sir.
he
said
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
as
i
recall,
he
said
that
he
felt
that
he
had
the
right
to
be
there.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
but
he
did
leave.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
well,
it
was
on
a
ruling
on
evidence,
sir
and
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
we
do
know,
sir.
i
will
get
that
point
of
view
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
all
right.
so
now,
the
uncontroverted
evidence
further
shows
that
at
short
times
he
sat
as
a
spectator
in
the
courtroom
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
a
whole
week
including
one
night
session.
that
at
times
he
sat
as
a
spectator
in
the
courtroom,
not
as
a
special
chair
as
contained
in
the
opinion
of
--
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
--
the
testimony
is
conflicting
as
to
exactly
where
he
sat,
the
indication
is
he
always
sat
in
various
chairs
as
a
spectator.
he
was
in
street
clothes.
if
i
may
refer
you
to
page
1120
--
1121
(a)
of
the
record,
you
will
note
the
chair
at
the
bottom
of
the
isle
sort
of
in
the
center
--
lower
center
of
the
picture.
that
is
one
of
a
roll
of
chairs
immediately
in
front
of
the
rail
and
the
testimony
is
that
at
sometimes
he
sat
on
that
chair,
and
other
times
he
sat
on
other
chairs
on
that
railing.
you
can
get
some
idea
of
the
prospective
by
turning
to
page
1120.
another
view
of
the
courtroom,
the
chair
would
be
at
the
extreme
left
end
of
the
picture.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it's
for
the
tipstaff,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
just
about,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
just
about
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
in
an
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
in
an
amphitheater
style,
sir.
there
is
a
map
also
contained
on
page
1131
(a)
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
a
person
who
is
detailed
either
the
keyboarder
or
tipstaff
in
charge
of
the
jury
as
to
--
to
keep
the
jury
together
to
keep
them
in
order.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
to
quiet
persons
who
might
be
making
some
noise
and
so
on.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes.
now,
as
to
the
controverted
evidence
concerning
judge
boyer,
on
the
note
passing,
the
alleged
note
passing
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
evidence
is
not
clear.
we
cannot
agree
on,
the
district
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
that
would
be
true
insofar
as
it
relates
to
his
being
on
the
bench
at
the
beginning
of
the
day.
the
district
court
found
that
he
was
not
present
at
the
night
sessions.
specifically,
found
that
he
was
not
present
at
the
night
session.
i
was
dealing
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question.
i
was
dealing
with
his
presence
as
a
spectator.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
the
jury
was
in
the
box
during
the
transaction
of
the
miscellaneous
business.
after
that,
he
went
away
and
the
evidence
also
indicates
that
he
was
trying
cases
in
another
courtroom.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
as
a
spectator,
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
don't
know.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
unusual
on
that
in
pennsylvania
and
the
judge
sitting
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
just
concluded
one
last
week
where
one
judge
was
presiding
and
another
was
sitting
in
the
courtroom
as
a
spectator.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
that
was
a
--
malfeasance
in
office,
a
perjury
and
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he
was
interested.
he
sat
in
as
a
spectator
in
street
clothes
over
in
the
other
side
room,
away
from
the
jury
the
same
as
this
one
and
i
don't
think
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
that
nor
do
i
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
this.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
for
at
--
to
sit
as
a
spectator?
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
may
i
correct
one
thing,
president
--
judge
keller
was
the
president
judge.
judge
boyer
was
the
junior
member
of
the
bench.
i
can't
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
unusual
because
i
do
know
that
it
is
a
practice
for
a
judge
to
sit
as
a
spectator.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
we
will
agree
that
he
was
respected.
we'll
agree
with
mr.
margiotti's
statement
that
he
was
well
respected.
we
--
we
say
that
that's
a
two-edged
sword
that
the
fact
that
he
was
respected
is
--
is
in
it
of
itself
some
evidence
that
he
would
not
engage
in
this
as
his
--
in
his
allegation.
in
answer
to
justice
clark's
question,
i
--
i
said
before
that
in
some
counties
it
is
required.
in
bucks
county,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
the
usual
facts.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
personally
know
of
none,
sir,
no.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i'm
not
from
bucks
county.
i'm
from
the
attorney
general's
office
in
harrisburg.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
that
i
know
of.
i've
been
unable
to
find
a
case
wherein
the
question
has
ever
been
raised.
mr.
margiotti
states
that
it
was
--
in
his
brief
that
it's
unprecedented
to
have
more
than
one
judge.
i
find
that
there
are
cases
where
there
are
two
judges.
there
is
one
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
where
they
raise
the
question
as
to
only
one
judge
sitting
when
there
should
have
been
a
lay
judge
present
in
addition
to
the
judge.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
in
the
country
counties,
yes.
two
judges,
especially
in
a
real
small
counties
two
judges
are
required
under
our
law.
you
cannot
hold
a
murder
trial
with
only
one
judge.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
they
were
in
ours,
even
in
allegany
county
back
in
the
1840,
sir.
our
law
now
says
that
one
judge
shall
constitute
anywhere
in
term.
it
does
not
say
that
only
judge.
further,
as
to
the
note
passing,
there
is
an
allegation
made
that
during
the
charge
of
the
court
the
--
judge
boyer
wrote
a
note,
passed
it
to
the
district
attorney
who
jumps
up
as
one
person
said
and
went
over
in
front
of
the
judge
waited
for
him
to
finish
his
paragraph
of
his
charge
and
--
and
then
spoke
to
him
with
reference
to
the
alleged
contents
of
the
note.
first,
there
is
no
proof
as
to
what
this
note
was
supposed
to
have
contained.
secondly,
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
the
note
was
not
passed.
third,
the
court
of
appeals
majority
refused
to
disturb
that
finding.
fourth,
judge
murphy
found
that
he
was
not
even
present
at
the
time.
next,
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
among
darcy's
own
witnesses
as
to
how
this
alleged
event
was
supposed
to
have
occurred
and
we
set
that
out
to
considerable
detail
beginning
on
page
63
of
our
brief.
the
three
persons
who
testified
as
to
this
were
a
brother
of
darcy,
an
aunt
of
darcy
and
a
friend
of
the
family.
the
three
persons,
two
of
whom
related
to
the
defendant
testified
that
this
occurred
significantly
enough,
even
though
they
testified
that
they
have
been
talking
about
it
for
six
years.
they
did
not
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
trial
counsel
nor
to
the
attention
of
appellate
counsel.
we
submit
that
the
possibility
of
recent
invention
is
there.
if
this
was
such
a
great
disturbing
thing,
would
they
not
have
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
counsel
for
their
brother
or
there
nephew
as
the
case
might
be.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
district
attorney
testified
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
this
occurring.
on
cross-examination
by
mr.
margiotti,
he
stated
that
to
his
best
recollection
it
did
not
occur.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he
didn't
flatly
denied.
judge
(inaudible)
is
now
a
judge
in
that
county
was
--
it
was
six
years
before
he
is
testifying
as
to
his
recollection.
he
would
not
be
categorical
yes
or
categorically
no.
he
said
to
the
best
of
his
recollection
it
did
not
occur.
further
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
it
was
made
at
the
time
--
at
the
same
time
as
his
participation.
that
would
be
before
he
died
but
at
the
time
it
was
made
he
was
extremely
ill,
he
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge
boyer,
i
don't
believe
ever
knew
of
the
allegations
against
it.
he
died,
he
never
testified
anywhere.
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he's
been
there
almost
two
complete
terms
of
ten
years
each.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
believe
he
was,
sir.
yes,
sir,
he
was
a
former
district
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he's
also
a
former
united
states
attorney.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
they're
not
set
out
one,
two,
three,
no,
sir.
but
they're
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
appendix
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
are
specifically
does
contain
the
findings.
after
the
--
after
the
opinion
came
down,
counsel
for
a
petitioner
requested
that
the
--
raised
that
the
requested
findings
of
fact
be
affirmed
or
denied.
that
was
done
in
an
appendix
to
the
opinion
that
is
contained
in
the
record.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
afraid
so,
sir.
the
--
in
addition
to
the
discussion
contained
in
the
opinion
in
chief.
the
opinion
is
quite
lengthy,
typewritten
ran
about
50
pages.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
--
the
findings
relative
to
judge
boyer
by
the
district
court
were
that
he
did
sit
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
you
mean
as
to
the
note
passing?
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
without
fact
report.
further,
i
would
recall
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
1242
(a)
is
the
key
to
the
opinion
on
the
findings
of
fact.
further,
i
stated
that
the
three
witnesses
were
conflicting
in
their
testimony
as
to
how
this
alleged
occurrence
took
place.
the
court
--
the
district
court
thus
was
confronted
with
a
--
a
conflict
of
testimony
--
testimony
by
persons
interested
in
the
outcome
--
critically
interested
in
the
outcome
it
involved
a
relative
and
the
district
judge
found
that
it
did
not
occur
and
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
disturb
that
finding.
judge
keller
stated
that
on
the
sidebar,
after
the
sidebar
conference,
judge
boyer
did
not
in
any
other
way
assist
him
in
the
conduct
for
the
trial,
the
inference
there
being
that
he
did
not
assist
through
the
passing
of
the
note
to
the
district
attorney.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
--
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
well,
the
italicized
things,
sir
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
i
--
i
think
he
is,
quoting
correctly
from
the
majority.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
is
one
conflict,
the
--
there's
the
difference
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
third
line
that
he
ever
--
he
even
attended
an
evening
session
that
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
he
did
not.
the
question
at
times
during
the
trial
judge
who
adjoined
him
on
the
bench
for
whispered
consultations
within
view
of
the
jury,
the
evidence
and
the
finding
by
the
district
court
is
that
at
one
time
it
occurred.
the
question
during
judge
keller's
charge
to
the
jury,
judge
boyer
sat
facing
the
jurors
within
the
enclosure
reserved
for
the
members
of
the
bar.
the
district
court
found
that
he
was
not
even
there
during
that
occurrence.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
do
not
believe
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
they
consider
very
well.
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
--
that's
the
difference.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
--
the
--
if
i
may,
sir.
i
think
first,
the
district
court
findings
are
supported
by
the
record.
secondly,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
--
in
considering
it
did
not
specifically
go
in
and
check
in
to
find
what
evidence
there
was
or
was
not
as
to
his
specific
findings.
if
i
may
further
point
out
in
this
note
passing
incident,
the
tipstaff
sitting
immediately
behind
the
jury
on
the
other
side
of
the
courtroom
stated
that
it
did
not,
that
no
note
was
passed.
the
district
attorney
stated
that
he
was
seated
on
another
table
during
a
majority
of
the
charge.
but
an
even
more
importance,
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
this
jury,
and
isn't
that
the
important
question
as
to
whether
this
jury
saw
any
note
passed.
during
a
charge
of
a
court,
where
is
the
jury
looking?
at
the
trial
judge
listening
to
the
matters
that
he
is
giving
them,
the
charge
that
he
is
giving
him
on
the
evidence
and
on
the
law.
the
jury
is
faced,
is
sitting
on
onside
of
the
courtroom
facing
the
judge
in
the
center
of
the
room,
the
occurrence
was
supposed
to
have
taken
place
in
the
extreme
other
side
of
the
courtroom.
we
submit
that
first
it
did
not
occur.
secondly,
if
it
did,
there's
no
showing
that
the
jury
in
anyway
saw
it.
and
thirdly,
there
is
no
showing
that
they
were
in
anyway
prejudice
by
it.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
there
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
if
i
may
that
it
--
we
can't
conclude
that,
if
i
may
correct
myself.
i
would
say
one
other
thing
though
on
the
--
on
the
question
as
to
prejudice
of
this
jury.
they
were
dealing
here
with
a
case
where
admittedly
it
was
a
cold-blooded
murder
where
the
confessions
were
not
repudiated,
where
there
was
no
contradiction
of
the
testimony
and
the
--
even
counsel
today
admits
that
it
was
first
degree
murder.
the
only
question
for
them
was
the
penalty
--
i
mean
that
would
give
them
any
problem
was
the
penalty
and
they
were
persons
that
you
will
read
from
the
appendix,
persons
of
maturity,
persons
from
diversified
walks
of
life
who
we
feel
entered
--
entered
the
jury
box
with
open
minds
and
who
gave
a
verdict
on
the
evidence.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
supreme
court,
367
pennsylvania
at
1
--
page
134
stated
that
there
was
nothing,
nothing
to
indicate
that
any
statements
or
actions
on
the
part
of
judge
boyer
were
prejudicial
to
darcy
receiving
a
fair
trial.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
--
i
--
the
only
way
i
can
answer
this
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
--
i
think,
it
was
stated
it
was
a
practice
--
common
practice
for
--
in
that
county
at
that
time
for
him
to
be
in
the
bench
at
the
opening
of
trial
for
the
miscellaneous
business.
other
than
that,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
is
no
--
no
procedure
set
up
whereby
it
can
be
done.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
the
only
cases
indicating
are
those
where
there
is
a
lay
judge
involved.
we've
--
we've
cited
that
in
our
brief.
it's
--
it's
on
page
58
of
our
brief.
common
--
the
required
in
the
remaining
judicial
districts
wherein
there
are
judges
both
learned
the
law
and
lay
or
associate
judges.
myra
and
murray
versus
the
commonwealth,
it's
an
old
case
and
it's
still
done
today
as
evidence
by
the
article
in
the
bar
association
written
by
one
of
the
few
remaining
judges
who
is
from
the
small
county
not
comprising
a
separate
judicial
district.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
he
advises
us
to
sentence
in
the
--
other
than
the
capital
case.
he
advises
us
to
sentence.
he
--
that
the
theory
apparently
is
this,
sir.
that
he
is
from
the
county.
he
knows
the
people,
whereas
the
judge
coming
in
from
another
county
may
not
know
the
people
as
well.
it's
a
carry
over
from
fact
in,
in
england
where
blackstone
says
two
judges
were
required
to
carry
on
a
court
of
oyer
and
terminer.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
in
bucks
county,
they
are
under
our
act
of
assembly
which
states
that
one
judge
shall
be
--
be
sufficient
to
hold
it.
there
is
no
prohibition
as
to
more
than
one
judge,
it
just
says
that
he
only
need
one.
it
was
a
departure
from
the
prior
law
where
we
did
require
two.
now,
it
says
we
only
need
one.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
some
judges
we
have
--
some
counties
we
have
--
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
not
bucks
county.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
do
not,
sir.
i
know
that
--
in
researching,
we
found
this,
we
did
not
--
we
don't
know
how
widespread
it
is
in
this
other
states.
i
notice
this
morning
though
from
--
apparently
it
is
done
throughout
in
--
in
various
states
to
the
greater
less
extent.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
sir,
i
think
that
is
the
question
and
i
think
further
the
answer
is
that
it
did
not
because
the
--
the
facts
are
that
he
sat
one
time
and
he
sat
as
a
spectator.
there
is
no
showing
that
many
of
these
other
things
occurred.
they
--
what
is
done
is
they
take
the
newspapers
hearsay
as
truth.
in
--
in
many
of
the
showings
for
example,
they
--
they
conclude
that
he
was
personally
prejudice
because
of
the
statement
in
the
sentencing
of
this
--
of
the
coconspirators
a
week
before
of
the
verdict.
what
did
he
say?
he
says,
"ladies
and
gentlemen,
i
don't
see
how
under
the
evidence
your
verdict
could
have
been
any
--
other
--
any
different.
under
the
evidence,
the
evidence
there
was
the
same
as
it
is
here,
that
it
was
uncontradicted.
and
--
and
in
addition,
may
i
say
that
in
pennsylvania,
if
he
had
been
the
only
judge
in
the
county
that
his
statement
in
front
of
the
foster-zeitz
jury
would
not
have
disqualified
him
from
carrying
on
the
week,
the
following
week
in
the
darcy
trial.
in
pennsylvania,
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge
as
to
the
evidence,
as
to
the
penalty,
as
to
the
guilt
is
proper
and
in
some
cases
are
court's
have
even
said
under
circumstances
it's
his
duty
to
give
his
opinion
to
the
jury
and
that,
one
of
the
key
cases
is
commonwealth
versus
simmons
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
i
think
i've
--
i've
answered
all
the
questions
except
the
one
of
judge
harlan.
i
don't
know
whether
i've
answer
it
in
the
--
in
the
conduct
from
my
argument
thus
far.
have
i,
sir?
mr.
frank
p.
lawley,
jr.
thank
you.
i
would
say
then
under
--
under
the
entire
record
in
this
case,
that
first,
the
district
--
the
state
courts
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
found
that
this
man
have
received
a
fair
trial.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
then
it
went
back
to
the
district
court,
a
hearing
was
held
and
again
they
said
it
was
a
fair
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
and
i
might
say
that
in
the
dissent
of
judge
kalodner,
there
are
many
things
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
the
staring
at
the
jury.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that.
finally,
i
would
say
that
this
case
has
been
longtime
between
the
--
the
crime
and
the
present
time
and
that
the
passage
of
time
itself
may
indicate
in
your
minds
that
possibly
there's
something
wrong.
we
ask
you
that
that
not
be
a
consideration
that
in
a
protracted
proceeding
such
as
this.
there
is
a
tendency
to
forget
the
facts
of
the
crime
itself
and
we
refer
you
again
to
page
--
beginning
on
page
6
of
our
brief
to
show
the
facts
of
the
crime
itself.
