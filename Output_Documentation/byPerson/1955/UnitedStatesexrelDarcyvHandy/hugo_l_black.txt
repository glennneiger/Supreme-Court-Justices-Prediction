sometimes
one
judge
ask
another
to
help
him.

were
there
any
rules
of
any
kind
under
which
one
judge
can
ask
another
to
come
in
and
sit
with
him
on
an
important
case
in
connection
with
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black

in
any
other
cases
that
indicates
one
way
or
the
other?

hugo
l.

this
extra
judge
do
when

black
do
you
know
what
is
the
basis

quote
from
corpus
juris
in
connection
with
the
practice
of
more
judges
than
one
to
sit
and
cooperate
entirely.
you
know
how
widespread
that
is
in
the
