and
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
could
tell
us
on
what
you
rely
for
a
reversal
in
this
case
because
that's
the
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
it?
justice
felix

is
that
--
justice

is
that
all
we
have
to
do
then?
justice
felix

now,
apart
from
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
well,
apart
from
those
when
you
said
the
totality,
you
mean
that
the
whole
trial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
we
have
to
understand
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
go
to
be
a
little
more
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
really
mean
--
you
mean
this
is
what
will
give
the
chance
to
put
as
an
evidence
of
the
cross-examination,
all
those
speeches?
justice
felix

(voice

--
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

well
that
the
main
reliance
of
the
defendant
is
on
the
latter,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
true
of
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
want,
or
you
think?

well,
i'm
just
right

justice

all
right.
justice

may
i
ask
if
you
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you.
justice

you
referred
a
minute
ago
to
the

the
affirmance
in
your
supreme
court
on
april
10th,
1951,
is
that
right?
justice

i
find
in
reading
that
report
about
the
criticism
about
judge

that
you've
judged
in
an

that
the
objection

justice

is
that
correct?
justice

is
it
not?
that
your

did
entertain
that
objection

from

the

the

in
this
case
were
they
drawn
generally
from

that
these
were

which
you

what
you
mean
by

justice

now,
when
you
say
he
left
the

justice

you
may
--
you
mean
that
the

meaning
he

it
was
conducted,
he
was
on
the
bench
for
doing
business
in
the
way
(voice

justice

all

justice

all
right.
justice

what
is
the

in

justice

but
when
this
objection
was
made,
judge

who
is
the
presiding

was
he

this

justice

when
this
objection
was

you
didn't

no.

there
is
far
wisdom
of
this

justice

how
do
we
know
what
the
matter
of
law
regarding
which
he
joined
in
the
ruling,
was
it
a
matter
as
to
which
--
it
wasn't
a
question
of
right
or
wrong
but
a
question
discretion
of
the

judge.
justice

so
that
the

might

one

sat
with

the
two
of
them
did.
justice

but
you
--
i
gather
from
what
your

your
answer,
let's
say
(inaudible).
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
we
cannot
tell
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
minimum
number,
unquestioned
number
of
sessions
during
which
he
was
in
court
while
the
darcy
trial
at
such
was
on?
justice

i'm
not
asking
the
length
of
time
he
sat
but
actually
his
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
say
--
then
you
say
it
couldn't
have
been
more
than
one
surprise,
and
can
we
say
anything
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
practice
for
a
judge
who
is
not
actually
trying
a
case
or
attend
as
a
spectator?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

he
was
just
interested.
justice

(inaudible)
but
you
say
it
was
in
view
of
performance?
justice

no.
a
case

a

were
deeply
obviously
within

(inaudible)
authority
in

to
sit
rather

justice
felix

will
you
dismiss
it
as
argumentative
or
established
that
judge
boyer
was
the
first
to
consider
this
apart
from
the
fact
that
any
of
your
judges
could
have
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
not
uncommon
(inaudible)
time,
two
judges
was
required
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lawley,
may
i
come
to
you
to
--
turning
to
page
1253,
volume
4
of
the
record
in
which
judge

summarizes
what
he
in

from
the
statement

what
he
call
the
factual
findings
and
judge
hastie's
opinion
on
behalf
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
indicated
to
wield
which
one
of
those
factual
findings
as
they
call
you
would
say
not
valid
to
be
taken
by
(inaudible)
factual
findings.
justice
felix

it's
only
italicized
--
justice

i
take
it

i
haven't

i
am

that

has
to
go
back
to
what
the

found

justice

(voice

members

make

contested
in

carefully
considered
by
the

i
assume
if
one
had

i
assume
that
one
categorically

it
undoubtably
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
answer.
but
my
question
is,
do
that
mean
i
have
to
search
the
record
to
see
what
the
district
--
district
court
finding
were
against
the
evidence
which
led
the
court

appeals
to
reject
it
or
that
he
just
--
i
should
read
the

(inaudible)
unless
i
have
to.
justice
felix

the
latter
you
can't
show
it.
it's
humanly
impossible
to
expect
the

say,
"yes,

were

did

fact

justice
felix

would
that
contravene
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
--
do
you
think
that
pennsylvania
can't
require
(inaudible)
two
judges
sit
in
a
case
with
the
responsibility
of
a
judge.
i
don't
suppose
anybody
would
question
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
problem
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
in
this
case
is
whether
the
comment
of
judge
boyer
in
view
of
his
relation
to
the
--
this
crime
and
enforcement
of
--
of
your
statutes
of
murder
in
this
crime,
so
behave
himself
and
he
didn't
decide,
did
not
assume
responsibility
and
was
in
charge
with
this,
involved
including
of
an
alien
force
in
the
content
of
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest,
perhaps,
i
should
(inaudible)
i
suggest
with
a
little
time
you
have,
it
would
be
useful
in
respect
dealing
with
actual

as
to

in
your
view

about
judge

justice

well,
then

justice

you
think
that's

how
can
