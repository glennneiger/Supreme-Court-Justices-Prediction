mr.
lester
s.
jayson
may
it
please
the
court.
the
tort
claims
act
of
course
is
a
broad
way
of
what
the
government's
immunity
can
sue.
it's
not,
however,
an
unlimited
waiver.
and
one
of
the
fundamental
limits
they've
used
on
the
coverage
of
the
act
in
which
it
is
now
settled
is
that
an
exclusive
claim's
based
upon
a
performance
of
the
governmental
function,
that's
both
the
majority
in
the
dalehite
case
so
held
and
the
dissent
does
not
disagree
with
that
failure
to
the
case.
it's
pretty
held
that
there's
a
center
scope
that
there
was
a
misapplication
of
that
exclusion
and
i'll
go
into
that
a
little
later.
the
governmental
function
exclusion
we
think
has
two
textual
basis
--
bases
in
the
act.
the
first
is
section
2674,
which
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
and
the
second
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
under
like
circumstances,
and
when
i
asked
him
for
identical
circumstances,
we're
asking
that
the
circumstances
be
viewed
in
all
of
the
circumstances
and
make
the
analogy
then.
now,
i
might
say
that
section
1346
has
somewhat
analogous
language.
then,
there
is
section
2680,
the
discretionary
function
exception,
which
bars
claims
arising
out
of
the
performance
or
the
failure
to
perform
a
discretionary
function.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear,
and
this
is
not
change
of
position
by
any
means.
we
don't
contend
here
that
this
light
was
out
because
of
any
discretionary
act
by
the
coast
guards
who
then
inspected
that
act,
who
would
--
who
inspected
that
light
house.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
we
don't
know.
no,
he
didn't
exercise
any
judgment.
we're
not
relying
on
that
factor.
accordingly,
we
don't
rely
on
the
discretionary
function
exception
in
the
sense
that
the
discretionary
function
exception
excludes
claims
involving
the
exercise
of
judgment
by
a
particular
governmental
official.
our
emphasis
here
is
on
section
2674.
that
has
to
be
met
first
because
that
lies
at
the
threshold
of
the
act.
however,
we
do
say,
and
i
might
inject
it
parenthetically
only
here
that
if
we
go
beyond
section
2674,
then
we
think
the
discretionary
function
exception
also
excludes
the
claim,
not
because
of
an
individual
act
of
judgment
by
an
employee,
but
because
we
think
that
if
we
examine
the
cases
dealing
with
the
words,
“discretionary
function,”
there
are
great
many
cases
in
that
field.
you'll
find
that
those
cases
will
apply
that
phrase
to
a
situation
where
you
have
a
governmental
activity
even
though
no
act
of
judgment
is
involved.
for
example,
you
may
have
a
case
of
negligent
fire
fighting
where
the
fireman
on
the
scene
was
negligent.
and
the
courts
will
say
there
are
such
--
many
such
cases
that
the
courts
will
say,
“there's
no
liability
because
this
is
a
discretionary
function.”
now,
insofar
as
that
concept
caries
over,
we
rely
on
2680,
but
what
we're
really
saying
is
that
2680
means
the
same
thing
as
2674.
and
i'd
like
to
put
that
apart
for
the
moment
because
our
emphasis,
our
primary
reliance
is
2674.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
we
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
we
think
that
any
activity,
which
now
is
or
which
historically
has
been
regarded
as
the
special
aim
or
function
of
government
falls
within
the
2674
exception.
for
example,
law
enforcement.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
law
enforcement,
the
apprehension
of
criminals,
the
prevention
of
crime,
fire
fighting,
the
prevention
of
fire,
the
extinguishing
of
fires,
weather
reporting,
the
regulation
of
commerce,
health
inspection,
these
are
areas
which
through
the
years
have
always
been
regarded
as
the
special
aim
of
government.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
don't
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
your
honor,
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
date.
for
example,
assume
a
federal
territory
where
there
is
no
u.s.marshal.
some
members
of
the
community
go
around
and
then
force
law.
subsequently,
the
government
sends
in
a
u.s.marshal.
clearly,
law
enforcement
is
a
governmental
function
and
the
fact
that
somebody
else
undertook
before
doesn't
stop
it
from
being
what
we
regard
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
it
appears
in
the
legislative
history
and
it
appears
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
constrained.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
don't
say
that.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no,
no,
i
don't
--
you
didn't
let
me
complete
my
thought
on
that
example.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
then,
i
was
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no,
no
because
i
think
that's
where
history
is
important.
you
look
to
the
function
and
you
say
that
normally
this
is
an
activity
which
has
been
handled
by
private
individuals.
let
me
give
you
--
let
me
just
carry
out
an
illustration
just
a
little
further.
before
the
advent
of
the
automobile,
no
one
would
have
thought
that
control
the
traffic
on
a
highway
and
the
establishment
of
caution
signs
or
danger
signs
was
necessarily
a
governmental
function.
but
as
progress
comes
along
and
the
automobile
comes,
it's
no
well
settled
that
the
control
of
traffic
on
the
highway
is
a
governmental
function.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
it
means
--
it
may
mean
also
that
it
doesn't
aid
to
the
exclusion
of
everybody
as
we
have
here
in
the
lighthouse
situation
or
it
may
mean
that
this
is
well
recognized
as
dominantly
governmental.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
and
if
you
go
back
far,
in
connection
with
every
one
of
these
illustrations
i've
given
you,
law
enforcement
and
so
forth,
you'll
find
that
you
trace
it
back
at
one
time.
it
was
done
by
individual
members
of
the
community.
but
today,
one
of
the
principle
--
one
of
the
basic
objectives
of
government
today
is
to
provide
for
the
protection,
the
safety,
the
health
of
the
community
through
this
type
of
activity,
and
it's
also
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no,
we
don't
quite
go
--
by
any
means
go
that
far,
your
honor.
a
reason
of
illustration
is
the
stepping
into
the
government
to
regulate
aircraft
in
flight,
and
that
has
a
direct
analogy
to
the
regulation
of
automobiles
on
the
highway.
it's
well
settled
that
the
regulation
of
traffic
on
the
highway,
the
responsibility,
the
duty
of
putting
up
signs
and
saying,
“danger
ahead,
caution,
school
crossing,”
or
what
have
you
is
an
obligation
which
nobody
undertakes
other
than
the
government
because
no
private
person
has
any
legal
obligations
to
do
it.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
gist
of
the
complaint
is
not
that
the
united
states
created
any
hazards,
which
caused
to
adapt
the
grounding
of
the
tug.
the
gist
of
the
complaint
here
is
that
the
united
states
could
have
avoided
the
grounding
of
this
tug
by
posting
a
warning
that
there
was
danger
here,
a
danger
in
the
water.
in
other
words,
with
just
the
essence
of
the
complaint
is
that
the
coast
guard,
through
negligence,
failed
to
fulfill
its
uniquely
governmental
function
of
promoting
safety
at
sea.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
male
truck
driver,
driving
a
mail
truck
is
engaging
in
an
activity,
which
all
of
us
recognize
everyone
engages,
and
namely,
driving
a
truck.
now,
we
--
we
can
disassociate
that
driving
of
a
truck
from
the
ultimate
end
which
is
the
delivery
of
the
mails.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
but
you
see
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
--
in
the
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
--
in
the
illustration
that
you
gave
your
honor,
of
driving
the
truck,
the
thing
that
the
plaintiff
was
injured
by
negligent
driving
he's
complaining
about
is
the
negligent
driving.
and
when
you
transpose
that
to
this
case
as
just
mr.
justice
minton
pointed
out,
the
complainant
is
not
complaining
about
something,
which
has
a
private
counterpart.
he's
complaining
about
the
failure
of
the
end
objective,
preventing
--
preventing
an
accident
at
sea.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
light
should
have
been
kept
burning.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
it
doesn't
--
so
far
as
this
point
that
is
concerned,
they
don't
care
how.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
they
don't
care
whether
it
was
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
accepting
the
allegation
of
their
complaint,
he
failed
to
--
the
notice
of
disconnection.
if
we
ever
go
back
to
trial,
actually,
we
will
prove
that
some
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
but
my
--
but
our
point
is
that
the
claim
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
in
the
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
in
the
dalehite
case
or
in
any
of
these
cases
involving
a
public
function,
you
can
look
to
see
what
actually
caused
the
damage.
why
didn't
the
coast
guard
put
out
the
fire?
someone
suggested
they
should
have
pulled
one
these
vessels
out
to
sea
soon
enough,
but
this
court
didn't
examine
the
precise
facts
that
gave
rise
to
the
negligence
of
the
coast
guard.
the
court
said,
“we
don't
have
to
examine
all
these
facts,
because
the
claim
is
barred.”
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
think
the
principles
in
announcing
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
well,
certainly
not,
your
honor,
but
that
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
principle
is
that
the
effect
of
the
tort
claims
act
is
a
way
of
immunity
that
the
court
says
there,
only
from
recognized
causes
of
action.
now,
there's
never
been
a
recognized
cause
of
action
for
the
failure
of
the
government
to
afford
these
public
services,
like
providing
for
the
protection
of
safety
or
the
health
of
the
community.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
--
would
consider
very
seriously
a
complaint
which
alleged
here
that
the
scc
was
negligent
and
not
preventing
a
stop
for
it.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
now,
in
attaining
these
public
or
governmental
functions
in
attaining
these
goals
that
i'm
speaking
about,
law
enforcement,
prevention
of
crime,
fire
prevention,
the
government
of
course
engages
in
a
various
type
of
activity,
which
do
have
their
private
counterpart,
driving
for
example
or
various
others,
repairing
a
building,
putting
up
a
building.
we
have
no
claimed
ever
that
this
lighthouse
had
fallen
and
struck
somebody
on
the
ground
that
the
tort
claims
act
would
have
largely
recovered
because
that's
not
so.
the
erection
of
the
structure
has
its
private
counterpart,
has
its
private
duties
and
analogous
liability.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
your
honor,
we
don't
--
we
don't
disagree
with
that
position
at
all.
let
me
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
put
it
in.
there's
no
doubt
that
everything
the
government
undertakes
in
one
sense
is
governmental.
you
can't
disassociate
the
government
from
its
activities.
but
when
it
comes
to
measuring
the
liability
of
the
government,
then
in
that
case,
this
court
said,
“when
the
court
--
when
the
government
comes
into
court,
you
can't
disassociate
it
from
its
being
as
government,”
unless
congress
otherwise
provide,
your
honor
said
in
that
opinion.
now,
here,
congress
has
provided,
congress
has
made
a
distinction
between
where
the
government
acts
a
government
and
where
it
acts
as
a
private
party.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
well,
now,
the
question
then
is,
is
this
a
situation
in
which
a
private
person
would
find
himself?
we
contend
that
no
private
person
could
ever
find
himself
in
an
analogous
situation.
first,
because
no
private
person
has
any
legal
obligation,
unless
leave
an
authority
to
go
out
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
to
maintain
the
lighthouse
and
to
tell
the
public
of
this
unhidden
danger
here.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
in
this
--
in
this
instance,
he
could
not
because
for
over
a
half
a
century,
congress
have
had
a
statute
on
the
books
expressly
prohibiting
not
only
a
private
person
but
any
public
body
from
undertaking
the
establishment
of
a
navigational
aid,
except
for
private
purposes.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
and
i
know
of
no
statute,
your
honor,
which
prevents
anyone
from
fighting
fire.
and
yet,
this
court
in
the
dalehite
case,
exonerating
the
government
for
a
so-called
negligent
fire
fighting
because
the
activity
had
no
private
parallel
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
and
we
--
we
agree
with
that
phase
of
it.
the
activity
involved
here,
promoting
safety
at
sea,
warning
navigators
of
the
hidden
dangers
in
the
water
is
an
activity
which
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
country
have
been
recognized
and
assumed
by
the
federal
government
since
1789,
since
the
ninth
statute
enacted
by
the
first
congress,
the
federal
government
undertook
to
operate
and
to
maintain
the
lighthouses
and
other
navigational
aids.
and
if
history
means
anything,
it
must
mean
something.
we
never
disassociate
so
with
history.
this
function
has
always
been
an
exclusively
governmental
function.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
oh,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
difference
is
that
the
railroad
has
itself
created
a
danger
or
hazard.
and
therefore,
anyone,
anyone
who
creates
a
hazard
--
hazard
duty
at
common
law
in
a
recognized
duty
to
warn
others,
but
no
one
has
the
duty
to
go
out
on
a
publicly
travelled
duty
and
stand
there
and
warn
the
public
of
something
that
he
didn't
himself
create.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
but
no
one,
other
than
the
government,
undertakes
these
obligations
for
the
community
at
large.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
trinity
house,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
trinity
house
has
a
quasi-judicial
--
a
quasi-public
organization.
it's
had
its
charter
from
the
crown
or
--
i
think
in
the
16th
century.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
case
that
my
friend
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
but
it's
always
had
this
function
in
england,
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
case
as
my
friend
cited,
the
gilbert
case,
as
my
recollection
of
that
case
and
it
was
cited
in
our
main
brief.
the
situation
there
was
that
the
trinity
house
has
left
a
part
of
the
structure
in
the
water,
which
a
vessel
went
into
and
damages
were
imposed.
now,
that
fixing
with
the
argument
we're
making,
if
anybody
means
a
structure
in
the
water,
he
himself
has
created
the
hazard.
that
liability
will
and
should
be
imposed.
if
we
had
wrecked
a
vessel
and
failed
to
mark
it,
plus,
ourselves
creating
the
hazard,
we
would
not
deny
liability
because
that's
the
same
type
of
liability
which
everyone
has.
but
if
someone
else
sinks
the
vessel
and
that
person
fails
to
warn,
so
that
we
have
now
a
danger
to
the
public
and
it
is
navigational
in
general.
now,
the
coast
guard
then
goes
(inaudible)
and
marked
that
common
danger,
we
would
say
we're
not
liable
because
now,
we're
acting
in
our
public
capacity.
we're
acting
in
this
capacity
as
a
government
--
by
a
government
so
to
speak.
now,
i
had
recognized
that
sometimes
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line,
but
i
think
that's
not
out
fault,
it's
the
fault
of
congress
because
they've
said
in
section
2674,
“you
can
only
impose
liability
in
a
situation
where
a
private
person
would
be
liable
under
like
circumstances.”
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
yes
and
that
situation
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no,
because
in
that
situation,
it's
true,
the
discretionary
function
exception
would
also
come
into
play,
but
it's
that
situation
where
the
two
exceptions
over
last
in
our
view,
which
say
that
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
discretionary
function
because
the
court
wouldn't
have
to
examine
to
see
why
the
light
was
out.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
insofar
as
the
claiming
that
the
light
should
have
been
burning
that
we
had
a
duty
to
keep
the
light
burning
as
a
public
service
to
perform,
and
one
marries
the
hidden
danger
of
the
sea,
we
think
this
claim
cannot
be
brought
under
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
as
the
course
of
the
light
going
out?
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
we
don't
think
that
the
--
there
would
be
any
difference.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
drunken
employee
certainly
is
committing
an
offense
and
there
would
be
some
means
of
public
prosecution
to
that
man
just
the
same
as
if
they
were
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no
civil
liability.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
think
we
have
the
same
situation
basically,
because
we
say
that
if
the
essence
of
the
two
points
that
they
have
to
keep
a
public
warning
up
doesn't
make
any
difference
why
the
light
was
out,
no
means
of
examining.
our
contention
is
that
if
the
function
that
when
--
when
looking
at
it
is
one
which
is
peculiarly
governmental,
and
then
the
congress
never
extended
that
type
of
liability
to
be
imposed
on
the
united
states.
and
we're
not
asking
here
for
any
--
this
is
not
a
question
for
suppression
on
the
court.
it's
already
been
brought
out
and
the
matter
was
passed
upon
in
the
feres
cases.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
that's
--
that's
the
result
that
reached
no
question
about
it.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
if
the
right
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
rationale
of
the
case,
there
is
one
part
of
the
rationale
that
we
rely
on
as
where
the
court
pointed
out.
there
has
never
been
alike
liability
between
a
soldier
and
the
government.
we
say
that
applies
here.
we
know
that
the
court
voted
that
language
and
relied
upon
it
and
applied
it
directly
in
the
dalehite
case
in
the
coast
guard
portion
of
the
case.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
but
your
honor,
we
must
recall
that
in
dalehite,
there
were
two
types
of
negligence
charged
to
the
government.
there
was
the
first
with
regard
to
the
negligent
manufacturing,
packaging
and
shipping
of
this
fertilizer
in
which
point
the
court
applied
the
discretionary
function,
exception
because
those
did
have
a
private
counterpart
manufacturing,
packaging,
had
--
had
their
private
counterpart.
but
the
court
was
also
concerned
with
the
allegations
and
the
findings
that
the
coast
guard
was
negligent
in
fire
fighting,
and
it's
that
case
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
and
it's
that
phase
--
it's
that
phase
of
the
case
that
we
rely
on.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
of
course,
it
is
not,
but
there's
just
isn't
no
liability
that
a
common
law
for
a
municipality
stated
a
fight
of
fire
properly,
so
there
is
no
liability
for
a
municipality
to
state
it
and
put
up
caution
signs
on
the
highway,
which
have
a
direct
analogy
here,
danger
signs,
stop
signs,
stop
lights
and
so
forth,
and
that's
the
same
type
of
case
which
we're
relying
upon
here.
now,
that
that
doesn't
mean
--
that
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
we're
going
to
contend
that
the
tort
claims
acts
bars
a
claim
based
upon
anything
that
tends
to
promote
these
objectives.
the
point
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
whatever
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
in
any
situation,
where
the
government,
in
seeking
to
obtain
one
of
these
objectives
and
engages
in
an
activity
like
that
of
a
private
person
and
a
liable
person
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
but
that
isn't
his
complaint.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
essence
of
his
complaint
is
not
the
turning
on
of
the
switch.
the
essence
of
his
complaint
is
that
there
was
no
light
out.
he
doesn't
really
care
why
the
light
was
out,
but
why
was
it
out.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
complaint
specifies
freedom
in
case
of
negligence,
just
as
the
findings
in
dalehite
at
a
great
number
indication
as
to
why
the
coast
guard
was
negligent.
the
court
in
dalehite
never
examined
those
findings
and
we
suggest
that
the
court
has
no
occasion
to
examine
the
--
the
allegation
here.
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
claim,
just
to
the
claim,
there
was
negligent
firefighting
never
recognized
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
not
in
this,
no.
not
in
this
setting.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no,
your
honor,
because
maintenance
of
navigational
aids,
maintenance
of
the
lighthouses
is
a
uniquely
governmental
function
just
like
fire
fighting
in
our
view.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
it
might
well.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
the
command
on
this
part
is
when
you
get
to
look
to
all
of
the
circumstances.
you
will
recall
that
in
the
feres
case,
the
circumstance
of
the
injury
was
malpractice.
and
on
the
assertion,
he
had
left
the
tower
in
one
of
the
soldiers
whom
he
operated
on.
another
claim
there
was
that
one
of
the
soldiers
had
died
in
the
barracks
because
of
the
effective
heating
plant.
of
course,
you
have
the
direct
private
analogy
to
a
landlord
who
has
a
duty
to
take
care
of
his
--
the
heating
plant
on
behalf
of
his
tenant,
but
the
court
went
on.
it
went
beyond
those
--
little
of
those
circumstances
and
found
that
there
was
a
uniquely
governmental
relationship
here.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
just
as
there
is
a
uniquely
governmental
relationship
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
would
then
propose
of
your
last
questions.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
well,
as
your
honors
know,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no,
we
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
we
know
and
anyone
reading
the
legislative
history
of
the
tort
claims
act
must
know
that
the
tort
claims
act,
congressman
sponsors
were
recognized
that
they're
going
to
go
cautious
of
it.
as
a
matter
fact,
there
are
many
conditions,
proceedings
for
the
right
to
sue.
there
are
many
exceptions,
many
exclusions.
and
as
recently
as
this
past
august,
congress
reaffirmed
this
awareness
that
because
of
the
act's
limitation,
because
there's
many
occasions
where
there
still
be
a
need
for
the
private
bill
rendered.
the
court
may
be
aware
that
they
passed
a
bill
providing
for
relief
for
those
who
suffered
damage
under
the
texas
city
disaster.
but
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
the
community
reports,
dealing
with
that
bill,
congress
was
very
careful
to
say
that
they
were
not
superseding
or
invalidating
this
court's
decision
in
dalehite,
but
that
they
recognized
both
before
and
since
the
enactment
of
the
tort
claims
act,
there
are
certain
voids
in
the
law.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
by
a
new
legislation.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
there
must
be
an
actionable
duty.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
there
must
be
an
actionable
duty
thereto.
there
is
certainly
a
duty
on
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
yes,
there
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
there
was
always
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
let
me
recall
for
you
a
decision
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
over
30
years
ago
in
this
court's
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
there
is
always
that
duty
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
--
but
just
as
there
is
always
a
duty
to
keep
that
light
burning,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
an
actionable
duty?
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
your
honor,
the
truck
driver
could
have
been
sued
so
and
we've
gotten
he
could
not
have
because
the
statute
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
there
was
a
decision
by
this
court
some
30
years
ago,
turner
against
the
united
states
in
248
u.s.,
which
i
think
indicates
the
nature
of
our
argument.
mr.
justice
brennan
is
writing
for
the
court
at
that
time
say
that
the
reason
there
is
no
liability
in
this
type
of
situation
as
dealing
with
a
governmental
activity,
i
think
with
just
governmental
activity
is
not
because
of
the
immunity
of
this
problem,
but
because
there
is
no
recognized
substance
of
light
at
common
law
to
recover
damages
for
the
failure
of
the
government
to
perform
its
public
duties
efficiently.
therefore,
he
held
in
that
case
where
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
some
immunity
unless
the
act
itself
creates
such
a
right.
the
claim
is
not
acting.
now,
it's
long
been
settled
by
this
court
because
aside
from
three
different
occasions
that
this
tort
claims
act
does
not
create
new
rights.
it
only
permits
suit
where
there
has
been
a
recognized
right
at
common
law.
now,
as
this
principle
was
to
be
applied
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
case
involving
negligent
weather
forecasting
and
very
recently
implied
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
case
dealing
with
negligence
of
the
fire
service,
allegedly,
failing
to
suppress
fire.
it's
also
been
applied
in
the
prisoner
case
where
a
prisoner
sues
the
united
states,
alleging
that
some
negligence
occurred
and
caused
him
injury,
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
prisoner
as
such
that
there
is
nothing
like
it
at
common
law.
we
say
that
the
closest
analogy
to
this
report
is
that
involving
cities
and
states
and
thereupon,
it
provides
safety
on
the
highway.
i
suggest
that
it's
virtually
unanimous
rule
that
if
a
city
or
a
state
is
not
liable
at
common
law
because
it
fails
to
maintain
the
stop
sign
or
a
precaution
sign
or
a
safety
marker
or
a
guideline
on
the
highway.
now,
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
perhaps
the
united
states
(inaudible)
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
that,
cities
are
liable
for
defective
streets
and
it's
always
been
regarded
as
an
exceptional
situation
based
primarily
upon
the
fact
that
the
city
has
physical
control
of
the
streets.
we,
of
course,
have
no
such
control
here
on
the
waters
and
the
street
situation
is
not
the
same
or
is
supposing
an
analogy
as
controlling
traffic
or
putting
up
signs
on
the
street.
do
you
think
that
development
is
a
much
better
analogy
your
honors
under
the
defective
condition
of
its
virtue?
now,
there'd
been
some
suggestion
that
when
the
united
states
undertakes
as
a
volunteer
to
provide
one
of
those
public
services
to
the
much
for
--
under
a
duty
to
carry
them
out
carefully,
i
will
suggest
that
if
we
do
have
a
governmental
function
exclusion
or
as
we
may
have
now
settled
to
impose
liability
of
a
volunteer
was
in
effect
to
destroy
that
exclusion
because
all
of
these
services
like
police
protection,
weather
forecasting,
firefighting,
control
of
--
or
control
of
health
inspection
are
undertaken
by
the
government
in
a
voluntary
manner
with
the
expectation
that
we
would
rely
upon
them.
congress
never
contemplated
that
that
type
of
activity
would
be
used
to
impose
liability
on
the
united
states.
we
say
that
the
maintenance
of
lighthouses
and
other
navigational
aids,
to
assist
and
to
guide
marines
has
always
been
historically
and
traditionally
since
the
beginning
of
this
country,
exclusively
a
governmental
function
with
the
exception
of
these
little
private
aids,
which
can
relate
to
private
purposes.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
we
think
that
there
are
certain
activities,
which,
at
first
glance,
any
lawyer
or
any
judge
will
know
that
this
is
uniquely
governmental.
law
enforcement
is
such
an
activity.
if
the
fbi
fails
negligently
to
prevent
a
bank
robbery,
i
don't
think
any
court
would
permit
suit
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
scc,
as
i
mentioned
before,
negligently
fails
to
present
the
stock
hold.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
seriously
consider
a
claim
being
filed.
and
yet,
these
are
uniquely
governmental
activity
regulation
--
regulation
of
stock
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
think
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
think
--
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
i
think
that
the
regulation
can
only
be
carried
on
by
the
government.
there's
no
private
person
who
can
regulate
because
no
private
person
has
the
authority
of
a
sanction
or
law
behind
it.
mr.
lester
s.
jayson
and
where
that
is
involved,
i
don't
think
that
the
tort
claims
act
would
encompass
liability.
we
ask,
therefore,
that
the
judgments
here
be
affirmed
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
sit
down.
