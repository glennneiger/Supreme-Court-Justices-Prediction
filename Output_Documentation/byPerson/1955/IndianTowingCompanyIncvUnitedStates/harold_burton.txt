justice
harold
burton
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
you
have
been
diverted
from
your
final
argument.
put
your
attention
back
to
the
post
office
situation.
suppose
the
post
office,
through
its
negligent
act,
failed
to
deliver
to
an
addressee
an
important
letter,
and
the
addressee
was
damaged
thereby,
would
he
recover
from
the
government?
justice
harold
burton
he
couldn't?
justice
harold
burton
then,
of
course,
if
the
--
if
the
post
office
is
driving
its
truck
on
the
street
and
hits
a
child,
it
can
recover?
justice
harold
burton
well,
now,
let's
analogize
that
to
this
situation
here.
the
government
has
this
light,
and
if
anybody
had
been
--
been
damaged
in
the
operation
of
--
of
that
light,
that
is
the
person
for
whom
it
was
--
it
was
set
up
to
guide
and
direct,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
recovery?
justice
harold
burton
but
now
then,
if
the
--
if
this
person,
who
was
going
out
to
service
the
light
and
had
been
driving
a
truck
had
run
over
a
child
and
hurt
it,
the
government
will
be
liable.
but,
when
--
when
somebody
is
injured
with
the
service
who
was
intended
for,
that
the
government
is
set
up
in
this
discretionary
exercise
of
its
power,
that
person
can't
recover.
justice
harold
burton
what?
justice
harold
burton
let
me
ask
you
a
question
please.
this
is
a
negligence
case.
before
the
government
could
be
liable,
there
must
be
a
duty
to
use
care,
and
that
duty
arises
out
of
the
pages
to
exercises
the
discretionary
function
without
negligence?
justice
harold
burton
what?
justice
harold
burton
but
can
--
can
such
a
duty
arise
out
of
the
exercise
of
the
discretionary
power?
justice
harold
burton
the
old
duty
to
use
care
towards
a
person
and
instruct
on
the
street.
justice
harold
burton
yes.
