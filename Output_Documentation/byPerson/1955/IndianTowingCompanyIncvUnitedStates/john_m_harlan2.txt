justice
john
m.
harlan
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
the
government's
reliance
on
the
clause?
it
says
that
the
liability
must
be
composed
only
under
such
circumstances
where
the
united
states
with
private
person
would
be
liable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
do
you
--
i
don't
quite
understand
your
position.
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
in
order
to
bring
yourself
within
the
tort
claims
act
that
you
must
show
there's
a
comparable
private
activity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it's
open
under
the
feres
and
dalehite
cases
to
argue
that
all
this
clause
means
is
that
assuming
that
this
is
a
solely
governmental
function
with
the
united
states'
liability
is
not
to
be
judged
on
any
other
standards
or
any
other
basis
than
those
of
a
private
individual,
if
private
individuals
had
engaged
in
this
business?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
my
question
was
whether
the
argument
is
still
open
under
the
feres
and
dalehite?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
montgomery,
would
you
mind
giving
me
that
previous
citation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
that
coast
guard
activities
passed
the
regulation
saying,
â€œthe
interest
of
the
economy
program
are
going
to
have
the
lights
going
and
a
couple
of
hours
a
night
instead
of
all
nights.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
now,
that's
--
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
was
there
any
kind
of
an
allegation
that
could
have
been
made
here
in
reference
to
alleged
negligence
in
maintaining
this
light
that
would
have
satisfied
your
view
of
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose,
in
the
allegation,
it's
been
that
the
government
had
maintained
a
drunken
employee
on
the
--
on
that
light.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
civil
liability?
