it
has
--
it
has
a
bearing
on
the
sense
of
conviction
of
the
government
that
there
is
a
great
(inaudible)
conviction
question,
fundamental
of
execution
of
question,
in
some
aspect
and
in
some
other
aspect.
justice
felix

well,
whatever
it
is,
there's
nothing
in
itself.
suppose
that
decision
is
out
of
the
window,
the
original
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
maritime
law
does
recognizes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
the
maritime
law
is
becoming
the
largest,
most
(inaudible)
justice
felix

(inaudible)
there
is
no
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
proposition
would
fall
under
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me
the
general
question,
and
this
isn't
your
first
argument
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice

--
anybody
else
can
conclude,
not
only
the
judge
why
the

is
prohibited
from

justice

i
can't
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
tend
to
admit
bar
by
talking
about
what
is
government
and
what
is
not
government
in
government
function?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice

are
there
two
types
of
category
--
justice

--
in
general
of
government
(inaudible)
justice

i
understand,
i

and
nobody

does
it

justice

(inaudible)
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

i'm
merely
suggesting
--
justice

--
you're
going
to
have
to
a

whether
the

if
the

even
the
attorney

would

varies
with

would
he
on
behalf
of
the
government
urged
this
commission,
if
they
say
this
is
to
be
restricted
merely
to
injuries
being
running
over,
(inaudible)
justice

the
government
could
have
not
believed
in
saying
mere
fact
(inaudible)
be
compensated
through
all
is
the
only
way
to
talk.
is
there
any
suggestion
that
his
act
to
perform
with
such
great
(inaudible)
was
intended
to
be
restricted
merely
to
ordinary
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
another
--
there's
another
important
thing
to
have
a
general
system
important
to
report
instead
of
the
abuses
or
the
inconvenience
in
the
birth
of
the
private
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
private
bills
in
the
court
one
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
--
all
that
show
is
they
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
had
been
a
case
for
damages
with
failure
of
awarding
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fire
fighting
--
the
fire
fighting
case
that
do
not
turn
on
governmental
(inaudible)
conduct.
they
turn
on
to
something
else,
just
(inaudible)
the
fire
--
private
fire
fighting
officials
aren't
(inaudible)
but
i
don't
know
why
(inaudible)
no
future
allowed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
same
reason
in
any
other
action,
suppose
all
it
comes
down
to
is
undesirable,
they
couldn't
--
(inaudible)
of
the
litigation,
because
every
time
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
same,
but
like.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
is
the
regulation
of
commerce
comes
within
the
special
aim
of
government?
what
date
are
we
to
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
it
becomes
so
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
you
get
this
--
where
did
you
get
this
phrase
into
conflict
of
governmental
function
in
relation
to
this
act?
it
isn't
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
you
get
it
from?
what
--
what
--
how
do
i
divide
a
conflict?
can
we
say
it's
there,
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
--
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
blame
the
position
with
tomorrow,
next
--
for
the
next
conversation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thereafter,
that
becomes
governmentally
yours
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
that
as
the
government
does
it?
would
it
mean
anything
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
by
looking
even
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
body,
where
the
body
comes,
assuming
a
100
years
ago,
(inaudible)
you
just
go
to
the
police
forces
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
also,
the
government
can
take
over
more
and
more
and
more.
after
all,
the
more
the
government
does,
the
more
the
tort
act
prints.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
there
anymore
uniquely
governmental
than
a
male
truck
driver,
driving
a
mail
truck?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
shed
a
light
as
what
is
done
all
over
the
united
states
every
night?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
physically
what
was
not
done
here
that
should
have
been
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
light,
i
just
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
(inaudible)
just
tell
me
what
this
fellow
failed
to
do
which
under
--
he
was
under
duty
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
a
failure
of
disconnection
that
happens
all
over
the
united
states
everyday,
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
anything
that
(inaudible)
the
lighthouse,
which
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
tomorrow
terminates,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
this
is
dalehite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
the
--
that
the
coast
guard
is
immunized
no
matter
what
he
does?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
principle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
--
did
the
government
--
is
it
the
service
of
the
government
to
provide
trucks
or
is
it
a
service
of
the
government
to
provide
trucks
for
certain
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
hence,
this
act
(inaudible)
against
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
said
he's
(inaudible)
in
which
this
party
expressly
disavows
rejection.
now,
that's
the
(inaudible)
untenable
condition,
in
a
private
action,
and
present
that
as
a
public
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
having
done
so,
you
must
get
that
out
of
the
specific
phrases
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
in
light
circumstance.
is
it
--
had
you
--
in
your
phrase,
you
would
have
had
assert
those
metaphysical
problem
by
which
the
state
court
try
to
get
away
from
the
fact
that
in
those
days,
there
were
sovereign
immunity
and
they
have
to
get
some
--
some
legal
document
to
get
away
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
point
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
here,
there's
lots
of
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
had
quite
a
private
(inaudible)
the
statutes.
i
suppose
i
don't
know
how
far
back,
certainly
which
can
give
--
preventing
anybody
from
carrying
mail
as
a
private
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
just
one,
mr.
jayson,
because
of
the
activity,
not
because
the
government
has
engaged
in
it,
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
activity
in
fire
fighting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
have
decided
that
that's
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
third
case
really
isn't
different
for
me
as
night
from
day,
which
they
held
and
i
would
wonder,
namely,
to
be
that
congress
had
established
a
different
status
in
affirming
and
the
relation
of
--
of
united
states
on
its
(inaudible)
that
it
had
in
many
ways
an
open
relation
to
--
to
those
(inaudible)
that
was
the
custom,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
result
that's
(inaudible)
a
reason
for
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
reason
for
the
prior
decision
in
standard
oil
against
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
dalehite
is
the
--
the
whole
cluster,
the
whole
part,
whole
action,
(inaudible)
that
they
had
and
appeared
as
an
important
postwar
or
still
war
operation,
which
weigh
out
in
the
part,
purely
something,
except
the
united
states
and
this
was
a
means
of
telling
us
a
high
amount
of
quality
on
the
highest
level.
that
again
is
this
fellow,
not
turning
on
the
switch
which
was
only
turned
on
or
turned
off
everyday
of
the
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
not
forget
the
fire
fighting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
question,
question,
excuse
me.
(inaudible)
in
which
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
say
the
government
would
be
liable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
turning
on
the
switches,
by
turning
on
the
switches.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
--
does
the
complaint
fail
to
state
negligence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
the
gist.
i
want
to
know
what
obligation
is
done.
it
says
how
an
allegation
says,
it
isn't
a
failure,
negligence
to
turn
on
the
switch,
and
to
see
if
then
there
was
light
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
and
nothing
that
he
can
allege
in
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
a
difference
--
i
know
(inaudible)
hypothetical
cases,
but
suppose
in
1948,
and
there's
a
current
revision
for
all
lighthouse
legislation.
they
came
from
private
enterprises
people,
the
(inaudible)
congress
and
they
say,
let's
(inaudible)
or
in
certain
areas
rather
than
the
private
people
who
put
out
buoys
and
lighthouses,
as
(inaudible)
and
yet
you
would
say,
but
they
did
try
it
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
they
turned
on
things
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
well,
that's
it,
the
soldier
and
his
government.
there's
something
very
deep
into
anything
else
in
the
world,
because
congress
recognized
it
and
provided
you
a
different
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
the
review
provided
for
this,
provided
a
bill
(inaudible)
which
is
a
very
thing
they
wanted
to
avoid
by
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
is
that
in
the
case
of
feres,
the
case
here
is
remote
as
(inaudible)
against
maryland,
frankly,
just
as
remote,
or
(inaudible)
but
i
wouldn't
cite
that
because
the
essence
of
that
case
was
that
the
status
of
the
soldier
(inaudible)
and
i
say
here
that
suppose
it's
very
broadly
legislated,
you
can
talk
about
government
here,
played
by
the
government,
pleaded
to
the
government.
here
is
an
analogizing
to
what
is
done
in
private
industry,
in
order
for
one
--
for
two
reasons,
one,
to
the
injustice.
two,
to
prevent
the
(inaudible)
holding
what
was
done
from
private
legislation
and
the
burden
on
congress
to
private
legislation.
what
we
now
say
is,
it
is
just
where
we
were
before
this
act
was
passed
prevailing
that
somebody
must
get
a
congressman
and
senator
to
secure
(inaudible)
private
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
effect.
that's
the
result
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
say
this,
but
that's
what
--
it
is
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely
validates
that
decision,
that's
the
decision.
how
can
they
invalidate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
they
can
change
the
law
within
a
--
but
what
they
are
doing
here
is
to
shuffle
out
a
lot
of
money
to
partners
that
the
whole
history
of
the
tort
claims
act
--
i
know
little
about
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
no
action
for
duty
in
the
truck
driver
before
this
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
no
action
of
the
duty
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
government
is
to
weigh
to
community.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
no
actionable
duty
on
the
part
of
the
truck
driver
when
he
go
over
that
part
of
the
trial
to
see
--
how
this
statute
is
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it's
a
suit
against
the
government.
they're
not
talking
about
private
here,
against
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
doing
(inaudible)
to
a
uniquely
governmental
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
could
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
unique
that
it
wasn't
heard
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
statement
must
have
qualified
for
providing
(inaudible)
