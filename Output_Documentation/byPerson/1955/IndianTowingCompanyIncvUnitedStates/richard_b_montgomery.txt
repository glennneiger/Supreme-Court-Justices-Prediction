mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
simple.
the
petitioner
alleges
that
the
failure
of
a
light
on
chandeleur
island
in
louisiana
on
october
1st,
1951
was
a
cause
of
the
grounding
of
a
tug
in
navajo.
the
petitioner
specifically
alleges
the
negligence
of
one
chief
petty
officer,
stone.
this
can
best
be
set
forth
by
the
allegations
of
the
petitions,
which
i
will
read
to
you.
the
failure
of
the
said
light
was
due
to
the
negligence
of
chief
petty
officer
stone
and
other
officers
and
members
of
the
coast
guard
in
charge
of
aids
to
navigation,
and
to
the
officers
of
the
coast
guard
cutter
salvia,
who
failed
to
properly
check
their
light
which
works
on
a
sun
relay
system,
that
they
failed
to
check
the
--
the
battery
and
the
sun
relay
system
which
causes
the
light
to
go
on.
and
is
alleged
upon
information
and
belief
that
there
was
a
loose
connection
which
could
have
been
discovered
upon
proper
inspection,
that
the
said
coast
guard
officers
and
other
personnel
of
the
coast
guard
on
duty
of
this
area
had
also
failed
to
properly
check
the
light,
and
to
make
any
attempt
to
repair
the
same
with
due
diligence
or
to
notify
marines
using
the
light
for
navigation
purposes.
the
next
allegation
is.
the
said
chief
petty
officer
stone
did
not,
when
he
checked
the
lighthouse
on
september
the
7th,
1951,
properly
checked
the
connections
which
were
out
in
the
weather.
no
attempt
was
made
to
check
the
light
to
see
whether
it
was
operating
properly
between
september
the
7th
and
october
the
1st,
1951,
october
the
1st
being
the
date
of
the
grounding.
and
that
therefore,
the
said
grounding
was
due
solely
to
the
negligence
of
the
coast
guard
in
the
maintenance
and
servicing
of
said
light,
and
in
say
you
to
properly
maintain
the
light
or
to
notify
that
vessels
of
the
said
light
was
not
functioning.
the
government
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
per
curiam
decision,
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court,
facing
its
--
its
opinions
squarely
on
the
majority
opinion
in
the
case
of
dalehite
versus
united
states.
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted,
and
as
your
honors
know,
this
case
was
argued
once
before
and
is
now
on
reargument.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
case
comes
squarely
within
the
fair
view
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
we
alleged
an
individual
act
of
negligence
by
a
coast
guard
officer.
we
do
not
come
under
any
of
the
exceptions
to
the
act.
the
exceptions
to
the
act
as
you
know
are
any
claim
arising
by
reason
of
claimed
negligence
in
a
discretionary
governmental
function.
any
claim
arising
out
of
laws
and
miscarriage
of
letters,
any
claim
arising
in
respect
to
the
assessment
of
collections
of
taxes,
any
claims
which
are
provided
for
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
or
the
public
vessels
act,
any
claim
arising
out
of
an
admission
of
any
employees
of
the
government
under
the
alien
acts,
any
claim
for
damages
caused
by
the
position
or
establishment
of
a
quarantine,
any
claims
for
injuries
while
vessels
are
passing
through
the
locks
of
the
panama
canal
zone,
and
the
--
any
claim
arising
out
of
assault,
battery,
false
imprisonment,
false
arrest,
malicious
prosecution,
abuse
of
process,
libel,
slander,
misrepresentation,
desist
or
interference
with
contract
rights,
any
claim
for
damages
caused
by
the
physical
operations
of
the
treasury
or
by
the
regulation
of
the
monetary
system,
any
claim
arising
out
of
the
combatant
activities
of
the
military
or
naval
forces
or
the
coast
guard
during
time
of
war.
now,
this
is
a
coast
guard
which
is
specifically
was
a
peacetime
activity.
any
claim
arising
in
a
foreign
country,
and
any
claim
arising
from
the
activity
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority.
now,
in
the
beginning
of
this
case,
the
government
relied
on
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
discretionary
act.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
government
still
sticks
to
that
position.
in
the
first
place,
the
establishment
of
the
light
would
have
been
a
discretionary
governmental
function.
if
the
head
of
the
coast
guard
had
decided
that
that
light
was
not
essential
to
navigation
and
ordered
that
light
put
out,
i
would
have
no
case
and
i
would
not
be
before
this
court.
if
they
had
decided
to
destroy
that
light,
i
would
have
had
no
case,
but
that
was
not
the
case.
the
coast
guard
thought
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
that
light
to
be
there.
and
the
light
was
--
it
is
alleged
that
the
light
was
made
up
immediately
put
back
into
use.
it
is
clear,
therefore,
that
we
do
not
come
under
that
part
of
the
dalehite
majority
opinion,
which
based
this
--
the
dismissal
of
the
texas
city
claims
upon
a
discretionary
government
function.
it
is
to
be
noted
that
continuously
throughout
that
opinion,
the
majority
of
this
honorable
court
says
that
there
was
no
individual
act
of
negligence
alleged
as
honor
justice
reed
said
that's
specifically
and
particularly
in
that
decision.
therefore,
this
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
that
case
on
that
ground.
furthermore,
it
seems
to
us
that
nowhere
in
the
act
do
we
come
under
the
very
important
exception,
which
is
exception
a
in
1680
wherein
it
says,
“no
--
no
official
of
the
government
enforcing
the
law
which
--
whether
the
law
be
constitutional
or
not,
or
whether
the
discretionary
function
shall
be
guilty
of
such
fault
as
to
allow
a
suit
against
the
united
states
government.”
it
doesn't
see
--
it
is
impossible
to
say,
“we
submit,
with
all
due
respect,
that
this
could
be
considered
in
any
sense
of
discretionary
function.”
this
man's
duty,
this
coast
guard
man's
duty
was
to
do
one
thing
and
one
thing
alone.
he
was
out
--
sent
out
there
to
check
that
light
and
see
that
it
would
work
properly.
the
court
has
to
accept
the
allegations
that
he
did
not
do
this.
the
court
has
to
accept
the
allegations
of
negligence
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
we
therefore
say
that
we
have
made
out
a
case
in
which
there
is
the
negligence
of
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
coast
guard
cutter,
an
employee
of
the
united
states
of
america,
acting
in
due
course
of
his
business
that
it
is
an
act
of
--
of
admission
but
the
act
specifically
provides
for
damages
in
case
of
an
omission.
so,
we
say
that
insofar
as
the
question
of
discretion
is
concerned,
we
definitely
come
under
the
act.
the
next
question,
which
has
been
raised
by
the
government
in
defense
of
this,
in
--
in
argument
of
it
is
that
this
is
the
ultimate
end
of
a
government
function.
the
--
the
very
learned
counsel
for
the
government
says
that
i
will
not
come
to
grips
with
his
argument.
well,
i
can
find
nowhere
in
the
act
or
anywhere
else
in
the
opinions,
in
the
feres
opinion,
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
dalehite
case
where
any
such
defense
or
words
are
used.
i
have
read
and
reread,
and
when
of
course
when
you
use
a
negative,
you
can
always
possibly
be
proven
to
be
wrong.
what
i
have
read
and
reread,
the
feres
opinion
and
the
dalehite
opinion,
and
i
find
no
such
saying
that
there
wouldn't
be
liability
in
case
the
damage
was
caused
by
the
ultimate
function
in
which
the
negligence
happened.
that
is
his
argument.
that
although
negligence
of
the
coast
guard
cutter
in
going
out
there
would
be
actionable,
because
the
ultimate
function
of
the
lighthouse
service
was
to
set
out
--
up
a
lighthouse.
there's
no
negligence
or
negligence
--
i'll
rather
put
it
this
way.
that
damage
caused
by
the
failure
of
that
ultimate
service
caused
by
that
negligence
of
an
individual
is
not
actionable.
he
has
taken
certain
decisions
of
state
courts
wherein
they
talked
about
governmental
functions
and
applied
this
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
although,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
emanate
such.
if
it
had
been
the
intention
of
congress
to
make
that
an
exception
to
the
--
to
the
types
of
claims,
which
are
actionable,
they
could've
put
it
in
their
exceptions.
they
could've
said
that
where
the
function
itself
causes
the
--
the
damage,
they
put
in
every
other
thing
and
to
show
that
congress
did
not
mean
that,
that
congress
thought
that
under
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
that
there
was
a
claims
for
damages.
they
specifically
exempted
damage
to
the
mail,
and
if
there
ever
is,
the
function
--
an
ultimate
function
is
the
delivery
of
the
mail.
but
i
always
understood
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
a
statute
was
if
they
wrote
in
exceptions
and
didn't
--
and
left
out
one
thing,
then
that
was
an
--
then
that
was
considered
as
not
being
accepted.
in
this
particular
case,
they
could,
as
i
say,
they
could
have
vary
easily
when
they
talked
about
the
coast
guard
and
accepted
the
failure
of
a
light,
but
they
didn't.
and
the
reason
for
use
of
the
governmental
functions,
words
or
of
the
phrase
comes
up
in
many
of
the
cases
involved
in
municipalities.
counsel
tries
to
make
these
cases
proved
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
excluded
in
a
decision,
which
are
not
deciding
for
the
decision,
but
for
a
very
learned
statement
by
justice
gray
of
this
court,
the
case
is
workman
versus
mayor
of
new
york,
179
u.s.552,
which
is
not
in
my
brief.
i
only
discovered
this
dissenting
opinion
recently
since
i've
been
in
washington.
in
that
case,
a
fire
tug
ran
into
a
vessel
on
the
way
to
the
fire.
chief
justice
white
decided
the
case.
the
question
was.
was
there
a
real
liability?
chief
--
although
the
state
of
new
york
held
that
fire
--
that
--
that
damages
arising
from
fire
were
not
actionable,
he
held
that
they
were
under
the
general
maritime
law,
so
the
case
has
no
--
has
no
bearing
as
i
see
it
on
this
case.
when
both
chief
justice
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
sir,
i
was
coming
to
what
they
said
about
that.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
that
could
be
so
because
he
--
but
he
put
it
on
general
maritime
law
but
he
said
that
very
definitely,
there
--
there
would
be
liability
if
the
proper
statute
was
enforced.
and
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
no,
the
decision
was
really
that
they
couldn't
--
the
maritime
law
that
the
maritime
law
governs
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
right,
sir.
that's
absolutely
correct,
sir,
179
u.s.552,
decided
by
chief
justice
white.
he
said
that
the
law
of
new
york
did
not
govern
in
that
case,
because
he
could
not,
more
than
maritime
law,
which
has
been
made.
but
he
went
on
to
say
in
that
case
that
the
--
the
distinction
between
cases
where
the
municipalities
could
be
liable
for
failure
to
maintain
bridges,
and
failure
to
proper
repair
streets,
and
fire
had
and
--
and
the
fire
department's
work
was
that
the
fire
department's
work
was
really
a
function
of
the
state
government.
now,
although
it
was
delegated
to
the
municipality,
it
was
a
function
of
the
government.
and
since
the
state
had
not
authorized
suit
against
it,
you
could
not
sue
a
municipality
for
something,
which
inherently
belonged
to
all
the
people.
but
he
said,
“that
was
what
was
known
as
a
governmental
function
for
that
reason,
but
did
as
to
everything
else
in
municipality
did
as
for
instance
in
repairing
streets,
maintaining
bridges
that
that
they
could
be
sued
for,
because
although
it
was
a
function
of
the
municipality,
it
was
a
municipal
function.”
and
that
is
--
and
last
time
i
argued
this
case,
as
honor
judge
frankfurter
asked
me
how
i
could
distinguish
the
various
cases
of
the
states,
involving
stoplights.
well,
i
now
think
that
the
distinction
is
this,
there
are
many
states
that
now
hold
that
stop
lights
or
the
failure
to
operate
a
stop
light
properly
comes
--
is
actionable
against
the
municipality.
the
ones
who
--
who
do
not
fail
to
distinguish
that
the
operation
of
the
stoplights
are
not
part
of
the
police
work
of
the
city.
the
police
department
falls
in
the
same
category
as
justice
gray
says
about
the
fire
department,
and
the
new
york
and
illinois
make
that
distinction.
they
--
and
in
the
new
york
case
particularly,
the
--
the
stoplights
are
not
operated
in
the
state
by
the
police
department,
but
by
an
authority
which
is
given
the
--
given
the
duty
of
operating
those
stoplights.
now,
going
back
to
this
case,
the
coast
guard
was
not
operating
in
time
of
war.
the
operation
of
that
light
was
not
operating
as
part
of
its
duty
of
being
an
active
combatant
unit.
it
was
operating
it
solely
as
a
governmental
agency.
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
the
light
went
out
does
not
--
and
did
the
damage
instead
of
the
officer
individually
doing
the
damage,
does
not
come
under
any
restriction
or
exemptions
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
simply
because
that
comes
in
my
opinion
under
his
argument
on
what
is
novel.
a
novel
cause
of
action
and
that
comes
under
the
feres
case
it
seems
to
me,
more
than
it
does
to
dalehite
case.
now,
in
the
dalehite
case,
in
my
opinion,
i
don't
--
the
question
of
the
negligence
in
the
fire,
if
i
may
proceed
and
then
take
up
your
point
sir,
in
--
in
which
followed
right
into
the
course
of
my
argument,
fire
fighting
has,
since
the
time
of
henry
viii
been
considered
as
an
exception
to
all
other
rules.
as
many
of
the
authorities
say,
when
--
where
--
there
can
never
be
any
liability
imposed
when
it
--
as
a
result
of
fire
fighting,
a
negligence
in
fire
fighting
because
of
the
fact
that
that
is
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people,
and
it
has
to
be
done
instantaneously
and
decisions
have
to
be
made.
of
course,
in
my
opinion,
you
could
--
that
--
that
is
the
one
great
exception
to
all
rules
and
has
been
held
so
through
all
english
authority.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
to
the
--
to
the
fact
that
there
--
to
the
government's
contention
that
they
--
because
the
light
was
the
ultimate
end
of
a
government
service,
there
could
be
no
liability
to
people,
damages
caused
by
it.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
sir
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
sir,
i
agree
thoroughly
with
what
--
what
you
say.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
sir?
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
i
don't
understand
his
argument
either,
sir,
but
i'm
trying
to
show
that
there
can't
possibly
be
any
such
exception
in
the
tort
claims
act
or
any
--
or
any
failure
to
have
a
cause
of
action
for
the
--
for
the
light
going
out.
i
could
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
sir,
i'm
more
like
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
sir?
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
in
the
last
--
in
the
last
discussion
before
this
honorable
court,
that
was
one
of
the
important
arguments,
and
that
is,
if
i
have
to
bring
--
it
seems
to
me
that
i
carry
the
burden
after
thinking
that
over
of
showing
to
your
honors
that
this
comes
under
the
tort
claims
act,
that
i
cannot
leave
it
up
to
him
in
his
defense,
that
it
is
my
duty
to
show
that
this
type
of
--
of
disaster,
this
type
of
damage
definitely
comes
under
this
battled
tort
claims
act.
and
he
has
made
the
point
that
was
made
before
and
i
was
merely
anticipating
it.
maybe
that
is
bad,
a
bad
way
to
argue
my
case,
but
your
honor,
remember
this
is
the
second
time
and
i
have
yet
--
i
yet
do
not
know
what
the
decisions,
what
the
reasons
for
any
of
the
decisions
that
i'm
arguing
against
were
based
on.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
but
--
but
he
has
also
argued
strenuously
the
other
point,
which
i'm
--
i
was
trying
to
take
up
because
i
think
they
fade
into
each
other.
it
could
be
that
i
have
--
have
put
my
--
i
should
have
thought
it
was
the
noble
point
and
then
go
on
into
this,
but
--
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
question
of
the
whether
or
not
i
had
a
claim,
came
first.
well,
to
get
to
he
point
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
i
--
may
i
ask
you
if
i
have
made
my
reasons
for
arguing
this
question
of
the
end
result?
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
no,
sir,
i
was
merely
going
to
suggest.
you
asked
me
the
last
time,
sir,
of
what
i
thought
was
the
distinction.
well,
i
think
there's
a
distinction
between
the
good
cases
and
the
bad
legally.
[laughs]
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
the
ones
that
are
against
me,
sir.
[laughter]
may
it
please
the
court
to
go
on.
the
next
argument
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
you
would
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
sir,
if
--
i
believe
and
submitted
to
--
to
place
to
rely
that
it
was
not
discretionary,
then
you
relied
--
it
was
a
discretionary
act.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
the
next
question.
yes,
sir,
i
think
i
can
--
i
think
i
can
--
i
may
--
i
think
i
can.
that's
the
best
i
could
say
when
you
get
into
this,
this
line
of
argument.
sometimes,
it
--
it
comes
like
the
admiralty
law,
when
--
when
is
it
admiralty
and
when
it
--
when
it
isn't
as
you
get
to
the
dividing
line
that
is
very
difficult
to
--
to
elucidate.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
sir,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
it
is
--
it
is
my
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well
--
well,
the
--
the
feres
case
went
off
on
two
points.
one,
that
--
that
under
the
section
which
was
quoted
by
justice
harlan,
there
could
be
no
recovery
where
they
had
been
no
remedy
before.
the
--
the
justice
jackson
will
dissent
it
in
the
--
in
the
dalehite
case.
he
said
that
he
knew
of
no
instance,
even
among
the
militia,
even
where
between
the
state
and
the
militia
that
a
cause
of
action
had
ever
been
allowed
of
this
--
of
that
type.
he
went
on
to
say
that
no
one
could
ever
raise
conscript
or
--
or
have
an
army,
that
therefore,
there
was
no
such
remedy
and
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
--
of
the
act
to
create
a
remedy
when
none
had
existed
before.
judge
holmes
to
the
fifth
circuit
describes
it
as
a
unique
remedy,
a
unique
right
of
action,
which
has
never
been
existed
before.
now,
i
say
that
that
applies
also
to
fire
fighting,
whether
by
the
coast
guard
or
the
forest
rangers
because
it
has
been
universally
held
that
no
such
right
ever
existed
against
anyone.
but
i
say
that
this
is
not
that
type
of
case,
that
in
the
government's
own
brief,
they
show
that
there
are
over
3,300
private
beacons,
lights
and
other
aids
to
navigation.
after
all,
a
light
is
nothing
but
an
aid
to
a
navigation.
there
are
many
private
aids
to
navigation,
and
the
act
itself
by
which
the
government
regulates
aids
to
navigation,
and
lighthouses,
they
say
that
private
ones
can
be
authorized.
now,
there's
no
question,
and
no
one
--
i
don't
believe
will
deny
that
if
for
instance
on
a
railroad
bridge,
they
had
a
red
light
with
a
--
a
green
light
when
it
should've
been
red,
that
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
in
common
law
thought
against
the
railroad
company.
he
specifically
shows
in
his
brief,
original
brief
that
they
allowed
aids
to
navigation
in
channels,
which
are
used
by
corporations
for
there
own
vessels.
supposed,
by
reason
of
an
error,
in
the
marking,
the
vessel
went
on
ground
and
a
seaman
was
injured,
the
seaman
most
certainly
could
sue
the
corporation
for
his
failure
to
properly
mark.
it
has
been
held
that
if
you
have
a
right
and
it's
not
properly
marked.
now.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
no,
i
merely
--
but
i
have
to
show
in
order
to
get
around
the
various
case
that
it
would
not
be
a
novel
cause
of
action
to
sue
for
the
failure
of
obedience.
i
do
not
or
i
like,
i
do
not
believe
as
i
said
in
my
opening
argument
that
there's
anything
sacred
about
this
light,
about
the
government
operating
the
light
and
that
there
have
been
causes
of
action
since
time
immemorial
for
the
failure
of
the
properly
maintained
lights
so
that
this
is
not
a
novel
action.
this
not
an
unusual
action
like
there
would
be
in
the
feres
case,
and
like
there
would
be
in
--
in
the
case
--
the
dalehite
case.
i
am
not
saying
to
you,
i
agree
with
justice
jackson
of
course,
in
which
he
said
there
is
liability.
there
was
the
intention
of
this
act
to
grant
liability,
to
create
liability.
and
then,
he
thought
that
he
did
not
contend
that
it
should
be
confined
to
automobile
act
in
cases
in
those
sorts
of
things.
he
believed
that
even
the
--
the
so-called
discretionary
act
was
such
act
as
to
make
the
government
liable
in
that
case,
and
he
--
and
justice
frankfurter
and
justice
black
discerned
it.
i
am
--
i
thought
in
my
argument,
by
trying
to
show
that
in
my
opinion,
this
came
squarely
under
the
act.
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
those
two
cases.
my
case
from
those
two
cases,
i
--
i
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
although
the
americans
--
in
america,
you
did
not
have
private
lighthouses,
because
they
didn't
have
cooperation
at
the
time
this
country
was
established,
who
could
handle
lighthouses.
england
had
private
lighthouses
up
to
1860.
the
--
the
encyclopedia
britannica
and
the
work
by
hardy
on
the
history
of
lighthouses
showed
that
they
had
private
lighthouses
and
that
the
corporation
of
trinity
was
a
private
corporation
and
operated
all
the
lighthouses
in
--
in
england.
and
in
the
case
of
gilbert
versus
corporation
of
trinity
house,
queens'
bench,
vol.xvii,
1866,
at
page
795,
the
courts
says,
“in
no
uncertain
terms,”
that
when
they
operated
those
lighthouses,
there
was
a
duty
under
the
common
law
to
maintain
them.
that's
not
in
my
brief,
sir.
i
just
found
that
yesterday
morning.
there
was
duty
to
maintain
them,
the
failure
to
properly
maintain
them.
he
gave
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
yes,
sir,
and
they
were
not
only
trinity
house
light
who
operated
the
lights,
but
other
private
corporations
operated
the
lights.
so
that
i
say
that,
this
was
never
a
unique
government
function.
it
was
never
a
governmental
function
in
the
sense
that
there
wasn't
an
ordinary
common
law
remedy
for
the
operation
of
aids
to
navigation.
i
say
the
date
that
in
america,
private
--
private
operated
aids
to
navigation
where
there
are
definitely
actions
for
negligence.
this
cannot
be
considered,
analogous
to
fire
fighting
or
analogous
to
the
case
of
feres.
i
say
that
as
--
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
falls
outside
the
category
completely
of
those
two
cases.
i
say
that
furthermore,
it
falls
within
the
opinion
of
the
--
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
jackson.
and
i
say
that
i
cannot
see
how
he
can
say,
“i
cannot
see
where
it
comes
under
any
possible
exception
to
the
act,”
because
there
--
if
what
--
what
he
is
saying,
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
because
--
because
the
united
states
took
over
the
light.
and
therefore,
that
there
was
no
tort
claims
act,
no
one
could
sue
that
it
followed
ipso
facto
that
there
was
no
--
that
there
is
no
such
cause
of
action
in
existence,
and
therefore,
is
a
novel
cause
of
action.
he
says
this
that
the
government
couldn't
be
sued
in
america.
it
therefore
follows
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
known
to
the
law.
and
that
i
am
trying
to
create
a
new
cause
of
action.
i
say,
as
cause
of
action
at
common
law,
there's
causes
of
action
against
any
private
individual.
and
therefore,
this
is
not
a
novel
cause
of
action.
it
is
not
a
unique
governmental
function.
as
a
matter
of
actual
knowledge
and
fact,
it
is
only
a
--
a
governmental
function,
because
the
government
took
the
oath.
in
other
words,
if
the
government
decided
to
operate
the
switch
or
run
the
signals
on
railroads
because
of
safety
measures,
then,
once
they
took
it
over,
then
there
could
be
no
cause
of
action.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
correct,
and
i
say
that
a
--
that
a
--
that
you
cannot
possibly
say
that
there
is
--
that
this
is
a
novel
cause
of
action.
this
is
a
cause
of
action
which
--
many,
many
causes
of
action
against
private
people
operating
beacons
and
aids
to
navigation,
and
i
don't
understand
why
a
lighthouse
stands
in
a
--
and
apart
all
by
itself.
the
government
also,
unless
it
grants
you
permission,
operates
the
boards,
operates
other
aids
to
navigation.
they
grant
permission
under
the
statute.
and
so,
why
should
a
light,
just
because
the
government
decided
that
not
let
anybody
else
operate
a
lighthouse,
why
that
stands
sacred,
after
all,
it's
nothing
more
than
aids
and
navigation,
sir?
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
i
believe
that,
sir.
i
think
that
that
is
the
--
you
--
you
have
put
my
argument
--
as
i've
been
trying
to
put
it
much
better.
i
say
that
that
--
that
all
that
means
is
that
if
private
individuals
could
engage
or
how
to
get
engage
in
it,
or
do
engage
in
it,
i
won't
be
allowed
to
engage
in
it.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
it
certainly
is.
under
the
feres
case,
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
i
definitely
think
so
because
the
feres
case
goes
off
on
the
point
that
nowhere
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
there
ever
been
such
a
cause
of
action
even
considered,
and
he
says
that
even
been
as
mr.
justice
jackson
says
there's
even
--
the
only
case
on
it
decided
that
they
could
never
be
such
a
cause
of
action.
and
that
therefore,
specifically,
the
united
states
--
that
congress
should've
specifically
authorized
such
a
cause
of
action.
but
each
one
of
those
two
cases,
sir,
the
dalehite
case
and
the
feres
case
involved
other
things
beside
this
specific
point.
in
the
--
in
the
feres
case,
justice
jackson
said
that
congress
could
not
have
meant
for
a
soldier
to
have
a
cause
of
action
because
of
this
type,
because
they
were
under
the
tort
claims
act,
because
there
were
other
legislations
which
took
care
of
the
soldiers
and
which
were
in
conflict
with
this,
and
which
were
more
benefit
to
the
soldier
than
this
would
be,
and
that
if
congress
intended
--
if
congress
intended
that
a
soldier
should
come
under
this
act
under
those
circumstances,
they
would
have
said
so.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
sir,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
sir,
i
think
that
that
--
your
question
brings
out
the
first
part
of
my
argument
where
justice
frankfurter
asked
me
what
specific
point
i
was
arguing
to.
congress,
specifically
in
section
1680,
exempted
--
accepted
any
claim
arising
out
of
the
laws,
miscarriage
or
negligence,
transmission
of
letters
or
postal
matters.
they
specifically
exempted
the
coast
guard
in
war,
but
they
made
no
attempt
to
exempt
the
operation
of
light.
and
since
the
--
since
the
question
in
this
particular
case
is
a
--
is
not
a
discretionary
matter,
it
doesn't
come
under
the
exemptions.
and
i
say
further
that
under
--
what
i
have
read
about
the
interpretation
of
statutes,
it
falls
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
sort
of
thing
to
be
exempted
when
they
didn't
specifically
put
it
among
the
other
12
exemptions,
which
they
spelled
out
in
detail.
and
i
say
that
is
the
distinction,
that
congress
is
--
and
it
isn't
the
fact
that
it's
the
function
that
causes
the
damage.
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
discretionary
function,
and
that's
the
only
use
of
words
throughout
the
number
of
times
that
the
attorney
general
appeared
before
the
committees.
there's
no
such
talk
in
any
opinion
of
an
ultimate
function.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
no,
they
used
that
as
an
example,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
not
that
i
read.
they
used
the
word
--
they
--
they
used
the
language
which
we
find
in
these
exceptions,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
the
end
of
the
case
went
into
the
exceptions
because
he
had
the
exception
of
an
assault
and
it
would
--
it
had
to
be
determined
in
that
case
whether
it
fell
within
that
exception.
what
i
say
that
--
whenever
you
say
they
don't
or
that
he
didn't
--
they
don't
--
you
don't
know
where
you
going
to
end
up.
the
government
might
able
to
show
you
one
instance,
but
my
reading
of
it
doesn't
show
any
--
any
such
intention.
they
intended
to
get
around
discretionary
functions
on
a
policy
level,
and
that
was
the
intention.
in
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
government
says,
the
attorney
general
says
throughout
that
it
is
to
the
intention
to
get
away
from
the
ideas.
the
monarch
could
do
know.
the
king
could
do
no
wrong
from
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
no,
sir,
although
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
--
although
the
government
in
his
brief
tried
to
show
us
the
way
back
when
the
question
of
wavering
sovereign
immunity
hadn't
really
gotten
to
be
serious
that
they
refused
to
give
damages
for
the
failure
of
a
lighthouse,
congress
did.
well,
i
think
that
was
so
far
back
to
that
--
that
that
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
case
as
far
as
what
went
on
before
congress
in
--
in
the
party.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
it
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
right,
sir.
that's
right,
that's
right,
sir.
but
--
but
you
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
i
sir,
i
--
i
say
that
it
should
have
been
--
i
mean,
i
--
i
think
that
justice
jackson
more
or
less
disagreed
with
the
feres
case
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
but
i
can
well
understand
why
you
--
why
you
can
use
that
phrase
in
--
in
12
--
in
1679
to
say
that
“gladly,
there
has
never
been
such
a
cause
of
action
where
the
law
had
never
hide
of
such
of
cause
of
action
that
you
could
exclude
it
from
being
under
the
tort
claims
act.”
in
other
words,
since
in
every
country,
fire
fighting
--
there's
--
it's
never
been
considered
that
there
should
be
claims
for
arising
out
of
the
fighting
of
fires.
in
--
--in
--
there's
never
been
claims
arising
where
the
armies
had
been
raised
by
soldiers
against
their
government.
i'd
say
that
those
are
--
are
very
exceptional
but
that
that
--
this
--
that
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
because
they
are
analogous
situations.
and
if
the
government,
which
it
could
do
it,
couldn't
turn
over
its
army
to
--
to
a
private
individual,
but
if
this
is
in
england,
they
turned
it
all
--
the
lighthouses
over
their
private
individual,
there
would
be
causes
of
action.
what
--
it
isn't
just
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
decides
that
private
individuals
can't
compete
with
them
and
there's
no
federal
tort
claims
act.
does
that
destroy
a
common
law
remedy?
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
there's
never
been,
sir
that
--
that
i
know
of,
although,
i
don't
see
why.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
then,
i
don't
understand.
i
can't
understand
a
reading
in
the
opinions
in
the
state
courts
and
everyone
else
if
--
if
it
--
if
i
cannot
understand
why
they
couldn't
be
damages
under
the
--
under
the
dalehite
case.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
--
that's
private,
but
that
was
a
private
operated
company,
sir.
there
hasn't
been
a
case
against
the
municipality
for
the
failure
to
--
in
fighting
a
fire
or
for
negligence
of
a
fireman.
i
can't
go
around
that
fact,
sir.
i
know
of
no
case
where
they've
allowed
damages
in
england
or
i
wish
i
could
find
one,
but
there
isn't
any.
that
is
in
remedy,
which
has
never
been
allowed
and
all
the
authorities,
starting
with
henry
viii
say,
“it's
impossible
to
allow
damages
against
anyone.”
i
doubt
seriously
if
a
group
of
citizens
in
fighting
a
fire
decided
to
dynamite
a
house
because
with
--
even
though
they
didn't
have
the
authority
of
the
city
that
they
would
be
liable
if
it
was
done
with
discretion.
and
they
did
it
because
they
believe
it
wasn't
done
maliciously.
i
will
plea,
but
they
believe
it
was
necessary
to
save
the
city,
and
that's
why
i
say
that
can
--
you
can
explain
that
situation
under
the
language,
which
is
used
in
the
--
in
the
feres
case
and
it
doesn't
affect
my
case.
i'm
talking
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
that's
correct,
sir,
and
i
was
answering
the
argument
about
why
the
feres
case
and
why
the
dalehite
case
did
not
create
any
exceptions
to
the
--
to
the
rule
that
those
were
the
two
distinctions
that
there
never
had
been
a
common
law
remedy,
and
that
the
only
way
one
could
be
created
would
be
for
congress
to
specifically
create
it,
because
the
fact
is
that
there
never
has
been
a
common
law
remedy
for
fire
--
for
fighting
fire
and
for
the
damage
it
was
done
in
fighting
fires
by
anyone.
and
there
never
has
been
a
case
where
there's
been
a
soldier
allowed
to
recover
against
this
government
or
against
anyone
else
against
the
state
as
a
militiaman.
those
are
the
only
two
exceptions
that
could
be
brought
under
the
--
that
clause
of
the
section
to
which
justice
harlan
was
referring.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
it's
gilbert
versus
the
corporation
of
trinity
house,
law
reports,
queens'
bench
division,
vol.xvii,
year
1886
at
page
795.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
counsel
was
trying
to
make
a
distinction
by
saying
that
there
was
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
maintain
that
light.
well,
it
sort
of
shocks
me
because
once
the
government
creates
the
light,
an
aid
to
navigation,
they're
certainly
on
obligation
not
to
let
that
light
go
out
with
mariners,
warning
being
warned.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
always
report
discontinues
in
aid
to
navigation.
it
sends
out
notices
to
mariners
that
the
aid
is
going
to
be
discontinued.
and
if
someone
went
out
on
the
road
and
--
and
started
in
to
set
up
signs
to
prevent
accidents
for
some
reason,
the
dangerous
situation
exists
deeply
on
obligation
to
do
it
correctly.
now,
there
isn't
any
doubt
but
the
government's
argument
comes
to
the
fact
that
whenever
the
government
takes
over
a
function
and
makes
it
uniquely
theirs,
then
there's
no
right
under
the
tort
claims
act.
aids
to
navigation
--
will
not
--
are
not
considered
until
the
government
took
it
over
to
a
very
unique
government
function.
and
if
you
have
a
private
canal,
as
i've
said,
you
can
set
up
or
suppose
to
set
up
the
light
if
your
vessel
is
using
it
and
the
government
grants
permission
in
cases
of
private
canals
being
used
by
one
company
to
set
up
whatever
aids
they
need.
and
if
a
seaman,
as
i
said,
was
injured
on
a
vessel,
which
because
the
government
--
because
the
private
place
can
set
up
an
improper
aids
to
navigation,
their
safety
would
be
a
cause
of
action.
as
i
understood
what
the
sentence
meant,
it
meant
that
there
had
to
be
a
common
law
remedy.
that
it
couldn't
be
something
that
--
there's
never
been
a
common
law
right
created
for.
they're
bound
to
become
law
rights
where
improper
aid
to
anybody
is
--
is
used
as
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
sir?
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well,
i
said
--
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
i
say
--
i
say
that
there's
always
been
such
a
doctrine
like
places,
new
haven.
it's
always
said
that
if
you
thought
to
do
something,
the
government
as
i
said
didn't
have
to
put
up
this
light.
that
would
have
been
a
discretionary
measure
for
having
to
put
up
the
light
--
having
allowed
mariners
to
depend
upon
the
light,
the
light
going
out
becomes
a
chance
to
america.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well
that's
--
that's
a
doctrine
which
comes
down
through
the
fact
that
say
anyway
you
have
a
charity
then
there
is
no
liability.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
not
everywhere.
there
are
some
states
--
within
the
state
to
do.
it's
a
theory
that
--
that
it
will
make
the
people
make
for
charity
to
do
more
good
to
the
ultimate
number
of
people
by
not
allowing
their
recovery
because
otherwise,
these
institutions,
which
are
running
on
private
charity
wouldn't
be
able
to
function
to
the
benefit
of
the
--
of
people.
mr.
richard
b.
montgomery
well
i'm
speaking
--
sir,
i'm
speaking
for
my
state
only
because
i
have
listened
to
the
law
for
charity
institution.
