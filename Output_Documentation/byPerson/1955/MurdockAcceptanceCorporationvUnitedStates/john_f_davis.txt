mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please.
as
mrs.
grayson
has
said
the
facts
in
this
case
are
supremely
simple.
leon
oatis
was
driving
his
1951
chevrolet
along
in
louisiana
in
april
of
1953.
investigators
of
the
internal
revenue
service
stopped
him
and
found
20
gallons
of
unpaid
whiskey
--
untaxed,
unpaid
whiskey
in
the
automobile.
we
don't
know
what
happened
to
mr.
oatis
and
we
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
whiskey,
but
we
are
interested
in
the
1951
chevrolet.
when
oatis
had
purchased
this
car
in
the
preceding
november
at
a
price
of
$2200
which
seems
a
rather
extraordinarily
large
sum
to
pay
for
a
car
which
was
at
least
one
year
old
and
maybe
two,
he
borrowed
on
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
a
two-door
chevrolet.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
bought
it
in
1952,
november
of
1952.
it
was
a
1951
car.
so
that
it
was
at
least
one
year
old
and
since
the
model
is
changed
in
november
it
could
have
been
two
years
old.
it
was
a
used
car
at
the
time
he
purchased
it.
he
borrowed
on
this
car
$1590,
the
conditional
sales
contract.
in
that
contract,
it
was
transferred
to
murdock
acceptance
corporation,
the
petitioner
here.
after
the
car
was
seized
with
the
whiskey
in
it,
the
united
states
attorney
filed
a
libel
of
information
in
the
district
court
asking
for
forfeiture
of
the
car
to
the
united
states.
this
is
provided
by
the
statute.
and
murdock
acceptance
corporation
filed
an
answer
asserting
its
interest
on
the
basis
of
the
conditional
sales
contract
and
asking
for
mitigation
or
remission
of
the
forfeiture.
now,
this
procedure
of
course
arises
under
a
statute,
18
u.s.c.
3617,
which
is
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
it
provides
three
conditions
which
a
finance
company
must
fulfill
in
order
to
be
successful
in
its
petition
for
mitigation.
it
must
have
shown
in
the
first
place
that
it
inquired
its
interest
in
good
faith.
it
must
show
that
it
had
no
reason
to
believe
the
car
was
going
to
be
use
for
illegal
purposes.
and
it
must
show
that
proper
inquiry
has
been
made
at
the
headquarters
of
the
sheriff,
the
chief
of
police,
of
the
federal
revenue
agent
at
--
at
three
places,
one,
the
place
where
the
purchaser
live,
two,
the
place
where
the
purchaser
bought
the
car,
and
three,
any
other
place
where
the
finance
corporation
makes
investigation
as
to
credit.
and
it
must
receive
a
reply
from
--
in
response
to
these
inquiries
that
the
purchaser
has
no
record
or
reputation
as
a
liquor
violator
either
of
state
or
federal
law.
now,
the
murdock
acceptance
corporation
before
it
acquired
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
--
in
these
three
places,
yes.
in
this
case,
there'd
be
only
two
because
there
was
no
credit
investigation
made
except
in
the
place
where
it
was
purchased
so
that
that
coincides
with
the
place
of
purchase.
but
under
the
law,
they
have
to
make
inquiry
at
the
place
of
residence,
the
place
of
purchase
and
if
there
is
any
additional
inquiry
as
to
credit,
they
must
make
this
inquiry
coextensive
with
their
credit
investigation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
technically
--
i
think
we
can
say
they
did
make
it
at
the
place
of
--
of
residence.
there
was
only
one
inquiry
made
but
the
office
at
which
they
inquired
covered
both
the
place
of
residence
and
the
place
of
business
so
that
there
is
no
issue
before
this
court
as
to
whether
they
made
the
inquiry
at
the
proper
places.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
no
question
that
it
was
made
in
the
proper
place.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
that
is
right.
i
would
--
i
would
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
it
isn't
mentioned
in
our
brief
but
it
appears
in
the
record
and
i
think
it's
a
fact
that
should
be
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
because
it
may
give
the
--
maybe
the
reason
that
no
reply
was
received
that
the
inquiry
was
made
in
the
wrong
name
apparently.it
was
made
in
the
name
of
leon
oatis,
o-t-i-s
instead
of
o-a-t-i-s.
and
it's
possible
that
the
revenue
office
had
it
out
--
undoubtedly
they
had
them
out
alphabetically
and
they
may
not
have
checked
under
o-a-t-i-s,
they
may
have
only
checked
under
o-t-i-s.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
--
we
--
certainly
it
would
be
a
matter
to
take
into
consideration
in
the
question
of
--
of
discretion
because
they
had
the
duty
to
make
the
inquiry.
they
had
the
conditional
sales
contract
and
they
knew
who
the
man
was
and
they
apparently
made
an
inquiry
under
the
wrong
name.
so
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
well,
no,
the
--
the
wrong
spelling
of
the
name
at
least
let's
say.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
--
this
--
the
inquiry
appears,
it's
printed
at
page
9
of
the
record
and
--
and
it
appears
that
they
ought
--
leon
o-t-i-s.
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
--
of
--
o-a
--
i
have
no
--
no
--
i
have
no
way
of
knowing,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
i
merely
present
this
as
an
example
of
the
--
the
type
of
inquiry
was
made.
they
inquired
--
they
made
a
mistake
in
the
spelling.
if
they
had
--
had
a
record,
they
might
have
missed
it.
i
do
not
know
if
they
had
it
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
neither
of
the
courts
below
has
made
any
--
any
mention
of
this
fact.
the
only
reason
i
mentioned
it
at
all
is
that
it's
transparent
here
on
the
record.
it
is
a
fact
that
they
made
this
inquiry
in
this
way,
for
what
it
maybe
worth.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it's
worth
something.
i
think
it
is
an
indication
to
this
court
that
the
court
cannot
overlook
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
was,
whether
the
court
wants
to
give
any
weight
to
it
or
whether
they
wouldn't
say
that
it's
been
waived
because
it
wasn't
raised
below.
i
don't
know
but
it's
--
it's
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
bear
on
that
element
of
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
but
it
made
there
on
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
once
you've
got
a
compliance
with
the
minimum
requirements.
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
court
didn't
mention
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
the
discretionary
element
is
still
in
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
on
the
--
on
the
whole
facts
there's
a
--
there's
a
showing
that
there
was
one
inquiry
made
and
only
one
inquiry
made
and
even
if
that
meets
the
minimum
requirements,
still
the
court
in
its
discretion
might
well
feel
that
this
is
not
a
basis
on
which
a
finance
company
should
make
--
should
take
the
paper.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
court
went
on
the
basis
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
district
court
went
on
two
bases.
first,
they
said
there
was
not
a
negative
reply
and
then
the
district
court
went
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
wasn't
an
--
an
outright
negative
reply.
and
then
they
went
on
and
say,
but
even
if
we
construe
this
as
a
negative
reply,
still
we
think
that
when
this
language
is
put
before
a
finance
company,
they
put
enough
on
--
on
the
one
sufficiently
so
that
we
--
i,
the
district
court,
i'm
going
to
exercise
my
discretion
to
say
that
they
didn't
do
the
reasonable
thing.
they
should
have
gone
further
with
this
information
that
they
didn't
have
a
complete
picture.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
what
the
district
court
says.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
they
make
no
reference
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
this
factor
that
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
they're
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
is
precisely
the
position
we
must
take
in
this
case.
the
district
court
--
well,
i
don't
know
what
was
shown
to
the
district
court
but
to
the
court
of
appeals
at
any
rate,
it
was
shown
to
the
district
--
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
form
of
reply
was
intended
to
be
a
clearance
from
the
treasury
department
and
the
court
of
appeals
still
affirmed
a
position
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
that
even
so
congress
has
said
that
there
must
be
a
certain
kind
of
reply
made
to
this
kind
of
inquiry.
and
even
though
the
treasury
department
thought
they
were
giving
that
kind
of
reply,
reasonable
people
receiving
this
paper
shouldn't
read
it
as
giving
them
that
clearance.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
--
the
--
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
puts
them
on
notice
so
that
they
should
make
some
other
inquiry.
and
they
said
congress
is
the
one
that's
legislating
this
matter,
not
--
not
the
treasury
department
and
we
will
--
we
will
make
our
own
judgment
as
to
whether
this
meets
with
the
statutory
requirement.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
precisely
it.
and
i
may
say
in
this
that
i
must
--
by
no
means
agree
with
mrs.
grayson
and
it
is
incumbent
on
us
to
establish
the
term
willful
negligence
--
willful
negligence.
all
that
--
all
that
we
feel
in
this
case
is
that
that
there
must
be
a
showing
that
whether
or
not
there
was
--
there
was
an
absolute
negative
whether
this
is
an
absolute
negative.
to
be
sure
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
don't
--
i
do
not
know.
this
statute
--
this
statute
was
passed
in
--
in
1935
so
that
it's
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
years
that
they
can
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
has
been
making
--
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
the
remissions
made
by
the
treasury
department,
by
the
secretary
of
treasury
are
made
under
a
different
statute
so
that
they
are
not
--
there
isn't
this
requirement
in
the
--
in
the
--
as
far
as
the
administrative
remissions
are
concerned.
what
has
been
happening
is
that
during
that
20
years
where
there
have
been
forfeiture
procedures
in
the
court
so
that
it's
--
got
before
the
court,
remission
has
not
been
opposed
by
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
it
has
generally
been
thought
and
the
united
states
attorneys
who
had
not
raised
this
point
in
forfeiture
proceedings
have
felt
that
it
was.
and
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
down
in
--in
new
orleans
suddenly
was
stricken
with
this
idea.
this
doesn't
appear
to
meet
the
terms
of
the
statute,
why
don't
i
try
it
out
and
he
went
and
tried
it
out
and
--
and
the
court
agreed
with
him.
and
that
is
--
i
agree
with
mrs.
grayson
that's
a
handicap
we
have
to
get
over.
i
mean
that's
--
that's
an
argument,
a
very
valid
argument
against
the
interpretation
which
is
followed.
but
we,
nevertheless,
have
to
meet
this
question,
"did
or
did
not
the
court
properly
interpret
the
--
interpret
the
statute?"
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
will
not
come
up
again.
and
that's
right
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
this
is
--
this
is
the
only
case
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well
--
well,
we
didn't
want
to
visit
it
on
this
company.
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
--
we
--
we
did
as
a
--
as
a
government
visit
it
on
this
company.
although,
may
i
say
this,
when
the
form
was
changed
in
this
case,
when
the
form
of
reply
was
changed,
an
opportunity
was
given
to
this
company
to
compromise
this
particular
case
so
there
wouldn't
be
prejudice
against
this
particular
company.
and
they
felt
that
this
particular
issue
was
important
enough
to
litigate
so
that
they
refused
to
make
any
--
any
offering
--
compromise
to
settle
this
particular
case.
the
case
itself
is
--
is
therefore
not
important,
it's
the
issue
and
the
issue
was
not
important
because
of
the
fact
that
we
have
changed
the
form.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
would
get
an
answer
which
is
just
the
first
sentence
of
this
answer
that
--
which
is
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they'd
say
no
record
or
reputation
as
a
liquor
law
violator
as
of
blank
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
signed
j.b.
investigator
in
charge,
alcohol
tax
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
would
not
oppose
remission
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
was
a
warning
contained
in
the
previous
form.
there
was
the
--
the
investigator
said,
“warn
this
people.”
he
said,
"this
is
the
answer
we
give
you,
but
you
should
know
that
we
do
not
have
complete
information."
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
maybe
they
knew
it,
maybe
they
didn't.
the
investigator
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
them
that
warning.
and
the
court
said,
"with
that
warning
you
no
longer
have
an
unqualified
negative."
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
maybe
that
needs
some
explanation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
of
course
to
encourage
finance
companies
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation
before
they
provide
the
money
for
who
--
like
its
cars.
now,
in
order
to
encourage
a
--
the
--
the
best
possible
type
of
--
of
practical
investigation
they
said
you
must
go
to
officials
and
they
named
the
state
officials
and
they
named
the
federal
officials.
now,
actually
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
best
records
the
most
complete
records
of
violation
are
kept
by
the
federal
officials
and
if
this
statute
is
to
be
as
effective
as
possible
in
preventing
the
financing
of
--
like
its
cars,
it's
very
advisable
that
the
finance
companies
make
the
inquiry
at
the
place
where
they
will
get
the
most
information
which
is
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
which
keeps
an
alphabetical
list
of
the
entire
business.
so,
the
alcohol
tax
unit
was
--
would
be
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
they
would
no
longer
come
to
them
because
it
wouldn't
give
them
protection.
they
would
go
to
a
sheriff,
they'd
go
to
a
police
chief,
they'd
go
to
somebody
else.
and
that
is
the
reason
for
changing
the
form,
it's
--
it's
now
a
form
which
is
neutral
as
to
what
it
covers,
it
just
says
we
have
no
record
of
any
reputation
as
a
liquor
law
violator.
that
presumably
will
--
will
satisfy
the
statute
and
at
the
same
time
it
will
give
the
finance
companies
the
protection
when
they
come
to
the
place
where
the
most
information
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
is
contained.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
the
first
place,
they
do
have
the
most
complete
records
that
are
available
including
some
records
of
state
violations.
so,
they
--
they
have
the
most
--
they
have
the
most
that
there
is
available.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
gives
them
a
clearance
under
the
statute,
yes.
i
would
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
would
hold,
but
i
don't
know.
maybe
the
--
maybe
the
--
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
form
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
form
was
changed
because
no
one
would
come
to
them
any
longer
for
information.
they
would
be
driven
to
the
lesser
sources
of
supply
if
they
gave
a
form
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
which
didn't
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
congress
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
congress
--
congress
in
passing
this
felt
that
there
was
a
limit
to
what
they
could
impose
on
finance
companies.
i
--
i
don't
know
why
but
congress
felt
that
there
was
this
limit.
and
so,
they
put
this
in
the
alternative.
they
said,
"you
shall
go
to
the
local
sheriff
or
the
chief
of
police
or
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
then
they
would
--
i
think
in
rewriting
the
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
that
obviously
would
be
the
same
as
the
case
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
if
there
--
there
is
--
it
--
it
maybe
implied
in
fact
as
things
turnout.
actually,
the
federal
alcohol
unit
does
have
more
complete
records
than
just
convictions.
and
there
may
be
other
sources
that
have
more
complete
records
in
some
states
too.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
on
the
basis
of
discretion
which
is
the
second
basis
which
this
judge
acted
upon,
i
think
that
a
judge
would
have
a
right
to
do
that.
but
when
the
statute
itself
places
these
officers
in
the
alternative,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
argue
here
that
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
all
of
those
officers.
i
think
if
they
give
a
negative
reply
or
negative
reply
from
anyone
of
these
officers
is
sufficient.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
is
possible
--
that
is
a
possible
interpretation
but
it
would
--
it
would
mean
that
the
statute
was
pretty
meaningless
in
using
what
the
alternatives
are.
it
would
appear
that
congress
intended
them
to
be
able
to
get
a
negative
reply
from
anyone
of
these
three
officers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
and
that
is
the
question
before
--
that's
the
first
question
before
this
court
whether
this
is
a
negative
reply
or
when
you
say
no,
but
and
then
go
on
to
explain
but
take
my
answer
with
caution.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
says
in
the
alternative.
the
statute
says
and
there
are
quite
a
few
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
"was
informed
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
at
the
headquarters
of
the
sheriff,
chief
of
police,
principal
federal
internal
revenue
officer
engaged
in
the
enforcement
of
the
liquor
laws
or
other
principal,
local,
or
federal
law-enforcement
officer."
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
and
we
believe
those
are
as
running
through
--
throughout.
there's
no
end
anywhere.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
there
would
be
an
end
in
that,
sir,
if
it
meant
a
law
phrase.
that
has
been
the
--
the
uniformed
interpretation
by
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
--
you
have
this.
i
--
i
think
there's
no
difference
in
this
that
the
internal
revenue
people
intended
the
first
form
and
they
intended
this
form,
they
intended
both
of
them
to
meet
the
statute.
the
court
has
held
that
the
form
did
not
meet
the
--
didn't
meet
the
requirements
in
the
statute.
i
--
we
wouldn't
--
we
wouldn't
raise
the
question
with
respect
to
the
new
form
if
it
were
raised
by
the
court.
i
don't
know
what
they
would
decide.
i
would
think,
however,
that
they
would
say
congress
has
made
this
--
made
this
decision
that
you
can
make
the
ultimate
inquiries
of
these
various
people
and
that
if
you
get
an
absolute
negative,
you're
entitled
to
rely
on
it
that
when
you
add
--
when
they
add
something
else
there
meaning
to
warn
you,
when
they
don't
add
anything
else,
they're
not
meaning
to
warn
you.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
not
quite.
before
this
law
was
passed
in
1935,
there
was
--
the
power
was
--
an
administrative
power
to
--
to
remit.
the
treasury
department
remitted
the
--
the
forfeiture.
under
the
prohibition
law,
the
courts
remitted
forfeitures
of
--
they
--
they
gave
the
finance
company
their
lien.
but
under
the
other
laws,
under
this
--
the
liquor
law,
the
secretary
of
treasury
had
discretion
and
it
was
unreviewable
by
the
courts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
know
why
it
was
changed,
your
honor.
there
was
a
feeling,
i
believe,
that
--
that
they
might
--
they
ought
to
have
a
right.
they
--
the
--
the
administrative
law
wasn't
reviewable
and
maybe
they
found
they
were
being
too
strict
and
they
wanted
to
have
the
courts
review
the
situation.
anyway,
it
was
in
1935,
let's
say,
at
the
time
of
the
repeal
of
the
--
of
the
liquor
law
that
they
said
the
courts
rather
than
just
the
treasury
department
should
make
this
determination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
1935
and
i
think
that
was
in
the
liquor
repeal
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
way
back,
the
--
the
first
case
upholding
that
--
well,
not
the
first
case
but
--
but
the
very
important
case
was
the
goldsmith
and
the
grant
case
which
--
let's
see
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
remember
the
date
of
that
case
but
it
was
a
case
which
was
decided
4-to-3
by
this
court
in
which
--
no,
it
wasn't
decided
4-to-3,
it
was
decided
8-to-1
with
justice
mcreynolds
feeling
that
you
couldn't
forfeit
the
right
of
a
--
of
a
finance
company
and
the
rest
of
the
court
saying
it
was
--
it
was
constitutional.
it
was
--
there
was
power
to
--
to
forfeit
the
right
of
the
--
of
the
finance
company
even
they
were
entirely
innocent.
justice
mcreynolds
dissented
in
that
case
and
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes,
that
was
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
as
far
as
forfeiture
goes
there's
no
question
that
forfeiture
goes
way
back
in
the
customs
laws,
way
back
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
one
stamp
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
one
stamp.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
--
it
changed
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
changed
it
with
respect
to
the
internal
revenue
law.
there
has
been
changes
made
before
with
respect
to
the
customs
law
and
there
had
been
changes
with
respect
to
the
prohibition
law
itself
and
there
had
been
other
--
other
cutting
away
of
this
absolute
forfeiture
but
this
was
transferring
really.
it
wasn't
a
new
thing.
it
was
really
transferring
from
administrative
rule
to
the
court
rule
the
right
to
remand.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
well,
even
now
he
can
compromise,
i
mean
the
remission
statute
is
--
is
definitely
cut
across
the
right
to
compromise.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
what
--
that's
the
intent,
as
i
say
this
is
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
present
one
is
an
absolute
negative
in
form.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
contains
no
warning
to
this
man
that
he
ought
to
investigate
further.
it
just
uses
in
effect
the
language
of
the
statute
and
it
says
no
--
no
record,
no
reputation
for
liquor
violation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
result
of
that
would
be,
if
we
made
that
statement
which
would
be
--
would
be
--
there'd
be
nothing
wrong
with
the
statement
except
that
no
one
would
come
to
the
best
source
of
information
to
get
the
information
before
they
finance
the
--
the
purchase
of
automobiles
because
it
wouldn't
do
them
any
good.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
--
no
--
no.
if
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
isn't
a
defective
affidavit.
it's
--
it's
a
statement
that
we
have
no
record
or
knowledge
of
his
reputation
as
a
liquor
violator
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
which
is
apparently
what
the
--
what
the
congress
contemplated
would
be
replied
in
--
in
this
--
in
this
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
we
didn't
draft
a
new
provision.
it's
their
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it's
their
intent.
and
actually
it
isn't
in
the
record
in
this
case
and
what
was
referred
to
in
our
briefs.
it's
something
which
happened
after
the
--
the
decision
was
made.
in
--
in
their
attempt
to
--
to
keep
the
finance
companies
from
underwriting
the
bootleg
business,
they
decided
that
they
would
give
the
best
information
they
could
to
these
people
which
would
give
them
the
protection
and
that's
the
form
they
deal
it
--
do
it
in.
it's
not
--
it's
not
an
attempt
to
conceal
anything.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
state
any
--
any
facts
which
are
not
so.
it
merely
doesn't
add
--
add
a
warning
which
the
commissioner
had
previously
thought
was
a
proper
warning
for
which
the
courts
have
said
prevented
his
warnings,
his
statement
from
being
adequate
to
--
to
protect
the
insurance
company
--
the
finance
company.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
they
do
keep
more
--
they
do
keep
some
state
records.
they
attempt
to
keep
as
full
a
record
as
they
can
of
all
of
the
violations.
so
that
it's
--
let's
--
they're
--
they're
trying
to
give
as
much
information
as
they
can
on
this
thing.
and
the
only
reason
for
dropping
this
is
that
they
have
no
intention,
they
---
they
would
just
drive
people
away
from
getting
the
best
information
they
could
gather.
i
may
say
it
too
that
when
we
say
that
there's
discretion
in
this
--
in
the
district
court
to
deny
remission,
we're
not
claiming
any
unreviewable
discretion,
we're
not
claiming
absolute
right
as
there
was
in
the
administration
--
in
the
secretary
of
treasury
and
make
a
decision
which
isn't
reviewable.
we
merely
say
that
when
there
is
this
type
of
single
inquiry
made
of
one
office
and
nothing
more
then
they
may
if
they
wish
deny
remission.
