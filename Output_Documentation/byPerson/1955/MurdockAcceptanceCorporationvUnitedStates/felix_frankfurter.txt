justice

what
you're
saying
is
that
the

is
having

standard

what

i

i
must

i'm

if
the
alcohol
unit
now
can
give
no

absent

negative,
if
they
haven't

any
records
and
for
all
they
know
there
might
be
records
elsewhere.
why
do
they
not

why
do
they
not
continue
the
agnostic
qualification?
justice

and
yet
a
new
form
gives
them
a
complete
clearance.
justice
felix

well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
if
they
have
no
more
knowledge
about
state
records
than
they
had
at
the
time
of
this
form.
why
do
they
not
in
conformity
and
with
complete
truth
just
say
that?
why
was
the

why
was
the
form
changed?

if
you
happen
to
know.

that

you

for
not
satisfying

i
understand
that

if

now
wouldn't
go
to
the

unit
and
go
to
the

person,
then
in
view

in
view
of
what
you
said
and
what
you
might
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
would
be
justified
in
saying,
when
the

says,

got
no

certainly,

should

it

it's

the

a

give
