what
you
--
what
you
say
then
as
to
entities
that
if
this
had
been
spelled
out
to
say,
"we
know
in
this
office
of
no
federal
or
state
violation."
that
would
have
been
a
full
compliance
to
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statute
--
going
out
to
construe
the
statute
liberally
to
arrive
at
that
result
here,
the
statute
by
putting
it
in
the
alternative
obligation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
understood
your
brief
that
there
was
no
question
that
you
--
that
the
inquiry
--
scope
of
the
inquiry
was
added
in
compliance
to
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
proper
place,
you
don't
question
that
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
might
excuse
the
revenue
office
but
you
can't
lay
that
on
the
doorstep
of
the
plaintiffs.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
when
you
agree,
your
stipulation
of
the
facts,
you
certainly
didn't
rely
on
that.you
say
that
an
inquiry
regarding
the
record
and
or
reputation
of
leon
oatis,
spelled
o-a-t,
was
made?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
real
reason
you're
injecting
that
point,
isn't
it?
because
wouldn't
you
agree
that
if
this
--
if
we
hold
that
this
is
a
sufficient
compliance
that
the
discretionary
point
is
out
of
the
case,
there's
no
evidence
to
justify
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
of
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
court
went
on
the
premise
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
--
the
absence
of
a
full
inquiry
resulted
from
this
answer
of
the
revenue
people,
of
the
--
of
the
federal
people
and
in
response
to
this
inquiry.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that's
what
the
district
court
says.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
going
to
say,
so
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned,
the
only
predicate,
the
only
premise
for
its
alternate
holding,
namely,
the
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion
is
the
--
is
the
reply
from
the
revenue
people
itself,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you're
saying
here
that
if
you
are
driven
to
that
second
point,
you
got
some
other
things
in
the
record
that
the
court
didn't
rely
on,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
years
has
this
form
of
reply
been
utilized
by
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
all
during
that
20
years,
the
department
has
been
making
remissions
on
the
basis
of
this
kind
of
answer,
has
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
remissions
of
forfeiture.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
people
who
were
entitled
to
--
regard
that
as
being
an
adequate
compliance
at
least
so
far
as
the
treasury
was
concerned,
an
adequate
in
--
in
compliance
with
the
--
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
don't
have
it
up
again
because
the
treasury
has
eliminated
this
ambiguity
by
its
change
and
form
of
answer.
so,
you
don't
have
it
up
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
you
just
want
to
visit
it
on
this
company
and
so
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
