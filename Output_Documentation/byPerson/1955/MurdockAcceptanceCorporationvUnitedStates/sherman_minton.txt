but
that
was
the
only
language
on
that
rubber
stamp
but
if
they
don't
use
that
now,
they
could
have
another
office
stamp,
couldn't
they?
justice
sherman
minton
they
could
then,
couldn't
they?
i
mean
--
justice
sherman
minton
that's
the
only
one
they
did
use
but
there's
nothing
on
earth
that
prevented
them
from
having
a
different
form.
justice
sherman
minton
there
was
a
standard
form
but
--
but
--
that
there
was
standard
form
but
it
made
it
just
as
vague
as
--
as
if
it
hadn't
been
a
standard
form.
i
mean
the
--
it
is
not
--
it
--
it
didn't
cover
the
whole
field
in
the
answer
and
then
apparently
on
purpose
it
didn't
--
didn't
cover
the
field.
justice
sherman
minton
but
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
reputation
in
saying,
there
is
no
reputation
that
--
that
we
know
of
and
we
don't
know
what
reputation
he
may
have
somewhere
else.
justice
sherman
minton
but
if
you
--
justice
sherman
minton
--
if
you
make
one
--
if
you
make
an
inquiry
as
to
credit
in
the
community
in
which
the
purchaser
lives,
you
also
must
make
inquiry
of
the
officers
there?
justice
sherman
minton
yes,
but
it
said
it
didn't
have
information
as
to
all
the
reputations
in
all
the
state
communities
and
so
forth.
justice
sherman
minton
under
you
present
practice,
mr.
davis,
the
government
gets
an
answer.
it
really
isn't
an
absolute
negative
but
they
accepted
it
as
being
absolute
enough,
isn't
that
so?
they
know
it's
not
absolute.
justice
sherman
minton
and
if
you
accept
it,
then
don't
you
say
that
the
statute
doesn't
mean
absolute
negative,
it
means
this
much
negative
or
nearly
negative?
justice
sherman
minton
but
you
know
it's
not
absolute
because
you
know
