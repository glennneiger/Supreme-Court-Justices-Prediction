ms.

hulen

may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
arises
out
of
the
seizure
of
an
automobile
as
violating
the
statute
against
a
vehicle
transporting
whiskey
without
tax
on
it
which
is
section
26
u.s.c.a.
3321.
a
petition
was
--
for
remission
was
filed
by
the
murdock
acceptance
corporation
under
section
18
u.s.c.a.
3617.
the
position
being
taken
and
it
now
being
admitted
that
murdock
acceptance
corporation
was
a
good
faith
lienor,
that
it
acquired
its
lien
on
this
automobile
in
good
faith
with
no
knowledge
that
it
would
be
used
for
the
transportation
of
--
of
liquor
in
any
form.
and
that
it
inquired
its
lien
after
an
investigation
and
inquiry
as
required
by
the
statute
at
the
proper
place
and
from
the
proper
federal
law-enforcement
office
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit.
that
it
had
received
form
the
alcohol
tax
unit
its
standard
form
reply
always
used
when
the
subject
had
no
reputation
or
record
for
violating
the
liquor
laws
of
the
state
--
of
any
state
of
the
united
states.
it,
therefore,
filed
its
petition
as
now
admitted
that
it
has
complied
to
that
extent
with
every
phase
of
the
statute.
its
petition
for
remission
was
denied
by
the
district
judge
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
where
the
car
was
seized.
in
his
opinion,
the
district
judge
stated
and
took
the
position
that
he
had
discretion
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
claimant
had
complied
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute
as
to
inquiry
and
regardless
of
being
a
good
faith
lienor,
that
he
had
discretion
to
deny
the
remission.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
was
--
there,
the
decision
of
the
district
judge
was
almost
summarily
affirmed.
now,
of
our
own
petition
for
rehearing,
mr.
justice
tuttle
wrote
a
strong
dissenting
opinion.
as
late
as
the
--
as
the
briefs
in
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari,
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
the
discretion
of
that
district
judge
is
not
reviewable
by
this
court.
we
have
an
illustration
in
this
case
of
our
great
democracy
at
work
and
that
we
have
here
a
case
involving
one
1951
chevrolet
which
after
three
years
of
storage
and
the
passage
of
time
could
not
be
worth
over
$500.
we
have,
however,
in
this
case,
the
murdock
acceptance
corporation
which
indirectly
is
standing
before
this
court
on
behalf
of
our
finance
company.
we
all
realized
that
our
economy
is
bottomed
on
credit
buying,
that
our
manufacturing
industry
is
bottomed
on
the
continuance
of
that
large
credit
buying.
we
also
realized
that
credit
selling
to
continue
in
the
course
in
which
it
is
now
progressing
must
be
also
bottomed
on
stability
of
its
security
on
the
knowledge
that
its
right
in
two
(inaudible)
will
be
determined
by
a
court
of
law
according
to
established
principles
with
the
right
of
review,
not
merely
as
done
before
1936
by
mercy
and
justice.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
simple.
it
was
tried
on
an
agreed
statement
of
facts
which
is
only
two
pages
in
length.
this
car
was
sold
by
--
the
paper
was
purchased
by
murdock
acceptance
corporation
which
is
a
tennessee
corporation
operating
in
surrounding
state.
at
its
jackson,
mississippi
office,
it
was
tendered
to
murdock
acceptance
corporation
by
a
dealer
and
prior
to
acquiring
the
--
the
paper,
murdock
acceptance
corporation
made
inquiry
of
the
proposed
purchaser.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
type
of
inquiry
or
the
wording
of
the
inquiry.
the
inquiry
is
made
as
to
both
record
and
reputation.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
location
of
the
inquiry.
the
inquiry
was
made
of
the
highest
federal
law-enforcement
office
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
it
was
made
at
the
proper
place
and
that
it
is
admitted
and
agreed
that
the
jackson
office,
which
was
a
statewide
office,
had
statewide
jurisdiction
and
the
inquiry
could
have
been
made
at
no
other
place
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
that
had
it
been
made
in
any
other
of
the
--
what
they
call
the
"field
offices"
which
might
have
been
a
little
closer
to
the
residence
of
the
--
of
purchaser
that
they
would
have
immediately
been
referred
to
the
jackson
office.
and
therefore,
no
question
is
raised
by
the
government
as
to
the
place
of
inquiry
or
as
to
--
or
the
office
has
made.
it
is
admitted
that
the
inquiries
made
of
the
only
federal
law-enforcement
officer
that
where
inquiry
could
have
been
made.
then
the
paper
was
purchased
upon
the
receipt
of
the
following
answer
from
the
alcohol
tax
unit.
and
that
answer
was
a
form
answer
rather
in
the
nature
of
bureaus
and
administrative
bodies.
it
was
stamped
on
the
bottom
of
the
letter
of
inquiry.
the
only
blank
in
the
answer
was
for
the
date
and
for
the
signature
of
the
officer
signing
it.
it
was
the
form
answer
admittedly
used
in
every
case
where
there
was
no
record
or
reputation
for
violation
of
liquor
laws.
it
was
--
therefore,
the
only
answer
which
the
murdock
could
have
gotten
where
there
was
no
record
or
reputation
or
for
violation
of
liquor
laws,
that
answer
contained
the
following
languages
and
stated
it
was
a
stamp.
no
record
or
reputation
as
of
blank
date
period.
this
office
does
not
have
a
complete
file
of
our
local
and
state
arrest
and
prosecutions
nor
does
it
have
knowledge
of
what
reputation
that
kept
--
prospect
might
have
among
state
officers
(voice

--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
sir,
they
could
now.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
they
had
--
no,
it
is
admitted,
mr.
--
just
the
--
that
that
was
the
only
one
they
would
or
could
use
at
that
time
where
they
had
no
record
or
reputation.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
they
could
have
--
could
have
prescribed
and
in
fact
we
are
informed
now.
we
--
though,
we
do
not
know
that
since
this
case
has
arisen,
they
have
changed
that
form,
whether
it
would
continue,
we
don't
know
what
the
--
but
at
that
time
that
form
had
been
in
use
for
we
know
--
i
don't
know
how
long
but
i
know
since
before
1936.
because
that
same
reply
had
been
approved
by
the
treasury
department
and
our
remission
had
been
granted
by
the
treasury
department
on
that
exactly
the
same
reply
before
the
new
statute
in
1936,
giving
the
courts
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
remission.
and
the
--
the
treasury
department,
had
for
many
years
before
then
as
--
as
admitted
by
the
government,
held
that
that
form
reply
was
satisfactory
and
sufficient
and
that
that
was
--
was
a
reply
that
they
had
no
record
or
reputation.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
well,
it
didn't
cover
the
field
so
the
government
says,
"now,
that
is
the
point
that
we
wish
to
discuss
with
your
honor."
of
course
they
could
have
used
another
form
but
it
is
admitted
that
that
is
the
only
one
that
--
that
the
atu
you
would
give
them.
and
it
is
a
form
that
they
used
in
every
case
regardless
whether
there
was
no
record.
now,
if
there
was
a
record
or
reputation
at
that
office
or
with
that
headquarters,
they
would
write,
"so
and
so
has
a
record
in
such
and
such
a
court
and
we
understand
that
he
--
or
we
think
at
this
office
that
he
has
a
reputation."
if
he
had
a
record
or
reputation
that
was
written
on
--
on
the
bottom
of
the
letter,
if
not,
the
stamp
was
used
which
what
they
intended
and
felt
was
a
complete
denial
as
complete
as
they
would
make
or
could
make
in
any
case.
if
a
member
of
this
court
should
happen
to
have
bought
a
car
on
time
then
the
inquiry
would
have
had
to
be
made
of
a
member
of
this
court.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
first
statement
in
the
reply
was,
"no
record
or
reputation
as
of
this
day."
this
office
does
not
have
a
complete
file
of
state
arrest
and
we
do
not
know
what
reputation
the
purchaser
may
have
with
state
(inaudible)
may
we
examine
that
--
that
answer
just
a
moment
and
that's
what
murdock
did
phrase
in
--
in
receiving
the
first
answer.
these
answers
have
been
given
or
stated
for
25
or
35
years
and
they've
always
been
received
in
the
same
form.(voice

--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir,
nationally.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
no
--
no,
sir.
nationally
used
and
used
for
at
least
35
years
and
the
only
answer
that
would
be
used.
you
couldn't
have
gotten
another
answer
out
of
the
bureau
because
that
was
their
rule
and
regulation.
now,
let's
look
at
that
answer
for
just
a
moment.
it
merely
told
the
claimant
what
he
already
knew.
he
knew
that
no
one
office
or
headquarters
could
possibly
have
a
record
of
every
arrest
and
prosecution
and
every
justice
of
this
court
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
everywhere
--
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
it
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
you
must
make
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
oh,
yes,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
if
your
honor
please,
the
sheriff
is
in
the
alternative
as
to
the
officers
that
you
must
make
it.
but
accumulative
as
to
the
place
that
you
must
make
it,
you
must
make
it
in
the
place
of
residence
in
the
place
where
the
transaction
is
closed
and
the
sale
is
made
and
in
the
place
where
credit
references
were
made.
in
this
instance,
the
credit
references
were
all
in
jackson-hinds
county.
the
sale
was
consummated
in
hinds
county
but
the
purchaser
lived
outside
of
hinds
county
about
30
or
40
miles.
now,
the
inquiry
should
have
been
made
at
each
of
these
places.
however,
when
the
inquiry
is
made
--
can
be
made
at
any
one
of
three
and
that
is
admitted
by
the
government
in
its
brief
several
times
and
it's
been
held
that
it
does
not
have
to
be
made
of
our
three
officers.
it
can
be
made
either
of
the
sheriff
at
his
headquarters
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
--
or
the
city
officials
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
yes,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
here
the
inquiry
was
made
in
an
office
to
which
it
had
jurisdiction
of
all
three
places.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
that's
right.
it
said
it
did
not
have
a
complete
file,
if
your
honor
please,
of
all
state
arrest.
in
other
words,
it
didn't
have
some
files
of
state
arrest
and
it
did
not
have
information
as
to
reputation
among
state
officers.
if
your
honors
please,
reputation
is
a
matter
of
the
mind.
if
they
had
--
if
the
atu
office
had
known
that
he
had
a
reputation
with
state
officers
then
that
would
have
consisted
or
constituted
a
reputation
at
that
office
or
with
that
office
there.
reputation
is
purely
a
matter
of
the
mind.
that
answer
not
only
told
them
what
they
already
knew
but
it
was
the
only
truthful
office
answer
that
any
officer
anywhere
can
give.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
what
they
have
changed
to
now.
we
--
at
least
they
used
the
word
liquor
law
violator,
no
record
or
reputation
as
a
liquor
law
violator
and
stop
there.
i
think
the
government
now
admits
that
that
is
sufficient.
that
we
didn't
have
to
make
the
inquiry
anywhere
except
the
atu
that
the
location
was
sufficient,
that
we
didn't
have
to
then
make
the
shot.
but
they
--
the
government
takes
the
position
that
that
qualifying
language
is
sufficient
that
it
was
not
a
negative
language,
if
your
honors
please,
and
not
only
told
them
nothing
we
do
not
know
anyway,
is
not
only
as
judge
--
mr.
justice
tuttle
pointed
out
so
brilliantly
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
the
only
truthful
answer
that
any
officer
could
make.
otherwise,
you
cannot
have
an
officer
guarantee.
the
statute
does
not
require
that
you
have
an
officer
guarantee
to
you.
he
has
--
and
to
say
to
you,
he
has
no
record
or
reputation
with
this
office
or
with
us
and
any
that
we
know
of,
but
we
--
we
know
that
he
has
none
with
no
office
or
anywhere
in
the
world
with
no
other
office.
no
officer
can
be
expected
to
guarantee
that
or
to
make
such
a
statement.
therefore,
the
silence
at
the
end
of
the
answer
was
merely
a
general
statement
known
to
the
person
who
inquired
and
the
only
truthful
statement
he
can
make.
but
not
only
that,
murdock
acceptance
corporation
knew
and
it
is
admitted
they
knew
that
there
were
long
line
of
cases
going
clear
back
to
1937,
where
the
courts
of
every
court
of
appeals
where
it
has
arisen,
beginning
in
united
states
versus
one
dodge
in
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
88
f.2d.
that
inquiry
only
needed
to
be
made
of
any
one
of
the
officers,
either
the
sheriff's
office
or
the
atu
office
or
the
city
office.
and
that
if
they
had
--
that
purchaser
had
no
record
or
reputation
of
liquor
law
violator
with
that
office
or
at
that
office
that
then
it
was
immaterial
whether
or
not
he
had
record
or
reputation
with
any
other
officers
or
at
any
other
location
or
among
any
other
officers.
that
being
true,
what
he
was
told
by
the
atu,
the
courts
have
said
was
immaterial
that
we
had
--
he
has
no
record
or
reputation
with
us
as
a
liquor
law
violator.
we
just
don't
know
what
he
may
have
--
don't
guarantee
that
we
know
everything
about
him
and
that
we
cannot
guarantee
that
he
has
none
anywhere
and
that's
all
it
said
and
under
the
decisions
of
every
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
this
inquiry
was
made,
there
were
--
there
were
at
least
15
or
20
decisions
to
that
effect,
then
the
inquiry
was
absolutely
satisfactory
and
sufficient.but
not
only
that,
if
the
court
please,
then
we've
come
to
the
most
outstanding,
i
think,
admissions
of
the
government
in
this
case.
they
not
only
admit
that
--
that
murdock
acceptance
corporation
was
a
good
faith
lienor
with
no
knowledge
or
information
whatsoever
detrimental
beyond
that
answer
if
that
could
be
called
detrimental.
that
they
received
the
only
answer
that
would
be
given
to
them
by
the
atu
if
there
was
no
record
and
the
only
answer
that
they
could
get
from
the
highest
federal
enforcement
officer
where
there
was
no
record.
but
they
also
admitted
that
the
atu
interpreted
that
answer
as
being
a
flat
denial
of
any
record
or
reputation
that
they
intended
it
to
be.
that
they
intended
that
answer
to
protect
a
claimant
making
an
inquiry.
now,
the
government
stands
before
this
court
and
makes
those
admissions.
we
thought
it
did.
we
intended
it
to
do
it.
they
also
go
further
and
admit
that
for
20
years
since
the
new
statute
was
passed
in
1936,
giving
the
courts
jurisdiction,
the
sufficiency
of
that
answer
has
never
been
challenged
in
any
court.
that
there
has
been
any
number
of
district
courts
who
have
held
--
held
the
claimant
entitled
to
remission,
where
exactly
the
same
answer
was
given.
but
after
justice
--
department
of
justice
ever
challenging
the
sufficiency
and
the
answer
and
without
it
ever
being
questioned
that
they
also
admit
that
that
fact
was
known
to
the
--
to
the
murdock
acceptance
corporation.
in
fact,
they
do
not
deny
the
effectiveness
of
this
--
certified
copies
we
have
attest
in
our
brief
of
cases
from
the
state
of
mississippi
where
the
identical
answer
came
up
in
decisions
not
challenging
that
answer
but
where
some
other
question
was
involved
and
where
that
answer
was
the
one
that
was
received
and
where
the
court
held
that
--
again
and
again
that
they
were
entitled
to
remission.
and
where
mr.
wimbish,
the
director
of
the
mississippi
department
of
the
atu,
testified
on
the
stand
that
that
was
--
and
four
years
before
this
paper
was
accepted
that
that
was
the
answer
by
which
they
meant
they
had
no
record
or
reputation.
it
therefore
says
it
admitted
that
they
intended
it
that
they
interpreted
it
in
that
way.
that
the
department
of
justice
had
never
challenged
it
but
the
district
courts
had
held
it
sufficient
for
20
years.
and
as
they
go
further
and
admit
that
the
treasury
department
prior
to
1936,
when
enforcing
the
old
statute
by
which
they
--
they
were
given
discretion
only
to
grant
remissions
or
where
there
had
not
been
any
willful
fraud
--
willful
negligence
on
the
purpose
of
fraud,
that
the
department
of
treasury
interpreted
that
answer
as
sufficient
not
to
constitute
willful
negligence
for
intent
--
or
purpose
of
fraud.
therefore
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
if
there
where
no
other
circumstances
whatsoever.
no
bad
faith.
no
other
set
of
facts
or
circumstance
which
--
with
which
they
are
not
admittedly
here,
which
would
give
a
bad
complexion
to
the
case
which
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
--
really
show
bad
thing.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
i
--
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
we'll
look
at
the
government's
brief,
you'll
see
that
their
position
is
that
there's
nothing
except
this
answer.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
that
this
answer
alone
is
--
is
all
that
they
can
say.
that
outside
of
this
answer
it
was
a
good
faith
purchase
with
no
knowledge
or
information
of
any
kind
that
would
lead
them
to
believe
that
our
vehicle
would
be
ever
be
used.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
if
he
--
well,
yes,
sir.
i've
read
this
over.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
i
--
i
submit
that
it
is
for
review
by
this
court
and
the
test
is
whether
that
answer
and
that
accepting
of
that
answer
constituted
willful
negligence.
they
admit
that
it
did
not
constitute
fraud.
that
there's
no
element
of
bad
faith
or
fraud
involved
whatsoever.
now,
then
the
fundamental
question
on
that
issue
is
before
this
court.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
sir?
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
the
word
--
the
phrase
"willful
negligence
and
purpose
of
fraud"
goes
back
to
the
act
of
1866
and
it's
been
continued
throughout
until
the
new
act
of
1936.
the
treasury
department
was
granted
discretion
to
allow
remission
where
there
had
not
been
willful
negligence
or
purpose
of
fraud.
it
was
advanced
forward
in
the
act
of
--
and
which
is
now
--
which
is
19
u.s.c.a.
1618
which
was
the
act
of
1922
made
applicable
to
the
internal
revenue
department
which
said
that
the
treasury
department
could
grant
remission
where
there
was
no
purpose
of
fraud
or
willful
negligence.
now,
our
position
here
is
that
the
judge
had
no
--
the
judge
below
had
no
discretion
that
--
arbitrary
discretion.
one
judge
couldn't
say
on
that
answer
to
--
it
was
nothing
--
no
other
facts
and
circumstance
that
that
answer
is
sufficient
to
allow
remission
and
another
one
say
that
answer
and
nothing
else,
there's
not.
but
it
is
a
matter
of
review
for
the
court
and
a
question
before
this
court
whether
or
not
that
answer
alone,
standing
alone,
was
approved
of
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
willful,
not
negligence
but
willful
negligence
which
has
come
down
in
the
statute
since
1866.
how
could
it
be
willful
negligence
when
the
courts
for
20
years
had
told
them
that
if
the
officers
that
they
inquired
of
had
no
record
or
no
--
they
had
no
record
or
reputation
with
those
officers
then
what
--
some
other
office
--
officer,
you
don't
need
to
go
to
all
like
they.
if
the
officers
inquired
of
they
have
no
record
or
reputation
with
them
or
that
office
that's
enough.
how
could
it
be
willful
negligence
when
the
department
itself
for
20
years
had
told
publicly
on
the
stand,
we
mean
that
as
a
complete
denial,
we
intended
as
a
complete
denial
and
we
interpreted
it
as
being
a
complete
denial.
how
could
it
be
willful
negligence
on
the
part
of
murdock
when
the
district
courts
and
the
justice
department
had
gone
for
20
years
and
allowed
remission
after
remission
on
that
answer
and
that
answer
alone,
no
other
inquiry?
and
then
you
could
say
that
that
was
willful
negligence
for
them
to
stand
and
accept
that
answer.
how
could
it
be
willful
negligence
when
that
is
the
very
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
that's
the
second
requirement
of
the
statute.
there
are
three,
of
course,
requirements
of
the
statute.
the
first
two
are
admitted
here
except
--
except
unless
they
contend
that
this
answer
gives
them
something
to
stand
on.
the
first
one
is
good
faith.
it
must
be
approved
of
good
faith
lienor
which
is
admitted.
the
second
that
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
would
be
used
for
the
violation
of
the
--
of
laws
of
any
state
of
the
united
states.
the
only
thing
they
knew,
which
is
admitted
here,
was
this
answer
which
was
received
from
the
atu
then
the
third
requirement
is
the
making
of
the
inquiry
which
they
--
what
we
must
make
of
only
one
--
we
make
of
only
one
of
the
three
officers
in
the
atu
as
the
profit
officer
and
get
a
negative
reply.
now,
the
statute
--
this
honorable
court
has
held
that
it
should
be
interpreted
according
to
the
test
laid
down
by
the
department
of
the
treasury
--
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
the
statute
was
enactedclearly
insofar
as
i
see
to
take
from
the
treasury
department
the
pure
discretion
which
was
not
reviewable
by
the
court
and
to
give
it
to
--
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
court.
but
under
that
statute,
which
this
court
in
united
states
versus
one
1939
ford,
stated
should
be
the
basis
of
determination
of
its
construction
of
that
statute.
well,
it
should
be
that
those
tests
in
what
--
and
the
acts
of
the
treasury
department
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
it
is
admitted
here
and
stated
that
the
treasury
department,
before
it
became
a
judicial
matter,
granted
remissions
consistently
without
questioning
it
whether
this
answer
was
received
and
interpreted
it
as
being
a
sufficient
answer.
the
question
is,
what
did
--
does
the
statute
mean
by
inquiring,
which
we
did,
and
getting
an
answer
that
he
had
no
record
or
reputation.
does
the
statute
demand
that
you
get
an
answer
from
that
one
place,
the
only
place
you
have
to
go
and
make
the
inquiry
that
we
know
he
has
no
record
or
reputation
anywhere
or
does
the
statute
merely
say
you
need
only
to
go
to
one
officer?
congress
knowing
quite
well
that
one
officer
would
not
know
whether
he
had
a
record
or
reputation
anywhere
in
the
world
and
would
not
know
what
his
reputation
might
be
in
some
other
place,
but
you
only
have
--
the
congress
said,
you
only
have
to
go
to
one
office
and
get
a
negative
reply.
and
what
congress
meant
was
that
a
negative
reply
as
far
as
that
office
was
concerned.
the
government
has
taken
a
position
that
we
should
have
made
the
same
inquiry
as
you
do
of
critic
of
--
of
the
credit
and
that
we
wouldn't
stop
for
the
credit
investigation
unless
they
guaranteed.
if
your
honor
please,
if
--
if
a
credit
--
any
credit
agency
ever
said,
"we
guarantee
that
this
person
has
--
is
good
--
a
good
credit
risk."
then
it
would
have
been
a
most
unusual
credit
agency.
in
fact,
the
associated
credit
bureau
of
america
use
a
form
in
making
their
credit
reports
and
they
--
it
contains
this
language,
"this
report
is
given
simply
as
an
aid
in
determining
the
propriety
of
extending
credit
of
the
value
or
condition
of
the
--
of
an
existing
credit
and
it's
based
upon
information
obtained
from
sources
deemed
reliable,
the
accuracy
of
which
hour
is
in
no
matter
guaranteed."
and
that
in
effect
was
all
that
the
atu
was
saying
and
all
that
any
truthful
officer
could
say.
in
our
opinion
he
--
he
has
no
record
or
reputation
with
us
as
a
liquor
law
violator.
insofar
as
we
know
he
has
none.
but
we
do
not
guarantee
that
we
cover
the
well
and
that
we
can
cover
everything
that
might
have
happened
in
any
court
or
in
any
office
of
the
united
states.
we
are
submitting
to
your
honors
that
this
administrative
interpretation
concurred
in
by
other
courts
over
a
period
of
20
to
30
years
is
--
if
reasonable
whatsoever
is
binding.
and
it's
binding
on
this
court
under
the
authority
of
bowles
versus
seminole
rock
&
sand
company.
that
also
the
same
result
is
reached
by
a
liberal
construction
of
this
highly
penal
statute.
this
forfeiture
of
property
or
property
rights
by
a
liberal
construction
of
that
statute
would
be
that
the
--
the
statute
does
not
require
that
a
claimant,
before
he
can
buy
a
paper,
must
go
find
some
officer
who
will
say,
"i
guarantee
and
i
know
of
it.
i
have
--
i
have
a
record
of
every
arrest
and
prosecution
in
the
united
states
and
i
guarantee
that
he
has
no
record
or
reputation."
that
the
statute
couldn't
less
--
should
not
be
in
construe
as
required
--
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
i
--
i
agree
with,
your
honor,
and
thoroughly.
by
putting
it
in
the
alternative
that
the
congress
knew
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
officer
to
have
known
and
if
it
had
wanted
a
further
or
require
any
further
inquiry
of
--
except
the
one
officer
would
have
made
so.
now,
we
submit
that
the
federal
government
should
not,
in
all
justice
and
fair
play,
stand
before
this
court
and
say,
"we're
here
as
a
good
faithful
lienor."
he
made
the
inquiry
at
the
right
place,
the
only
place
he
needed
to.
he
got
the
only
answer
he
could
get.
he
got
an
answer
that
the
government,
through
his
justice
department
with
the
atu,
that
the
courts
has
for
20
or
30
years
interpreted
as
being
a
sufficient
answer
that
it
is
admitted
that
the
murdock
knew
those
facts
and
found
those
facts
and
then
stand
before
this
court
and
say
that
there
has
been
willful
negligence
on
the
part
of
murdock.
we
submit
that
that
would
not
be
fair
play
or
judgement.
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
(inaudible)
ms.
elizabeth
hulen
grayson
if
the
court
please.
there
is
just
question
that
i
felt
maybe
had
not
been
completely
answered.
that
was
the
statement
of
first
the
warning.
there
was
no
warning,
if
your
honor
please,
to
this
answer.
if
it
had
been
given
as
to
one
purchaser,
yes,
it
might
have
been.
but
when
each
and
every
purchaser
was
given
--
you
were
given
the
same
answer
then
it's
not
possible
for
each
and
every
person
to
have
a
record
of
reputation
much
less
probable.
so,
there
was
no
warning
as
to
this
particular
individual.
it's
--
it
was
warning
as
to
everybody
regardless
where
any
inquiry
is
made.
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
now
the
courts
are
turned
to
interpret
the
statute
now
rather
than
the
treasury
department.
if
your
honors
please,
yes,
the
courts
are
now
--
maybe
perhaps
for
the
first
time
having
this
presented,
although
the
district
courts
all
over
the
country
have
had
it
presented
and
it
decided
that
they
were
entitled
to
remission.
but
the
rule
in
interpretation
of
the
kind
of
answer
that
is
required
by
the
statute
that
should
be
effective
here
is
of
where,
over
a
period
of
30
years,
those
officers,
given
the
duty
of
enforcing
the
statute,
have
interpreted
that
statute
in
one
way
for
20
to
30
years,
concurred
in
by
the
judiciary,
concurred
in
by
the
department
of
justice
that
then
that
method
of
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
controlling
on
this
court
if
it
is
at
all
reasonable,
if
it
is
subject
whatsoever
to
that
construction.
so,
we
are
asking
this
court
to
construe
it
liberally
as
a
highly
forfeited
penalize
--
penal
statute
and
to
construe
it
in
accordance
with
this
long
established
departmental
or
administrative
construction
which
is
they
admit
it's
reasonable.
that
so
far
as
they
go
in
their
briefs
as
to
say
it's
possible
for
it
have
another
construction.
and
as
this
court
said
in
u.s.
versus
one
1939
ford,
the
forfeiture
acts
are
exceedingly
drastic.
they
were
intended
for
the
protection
of
the
revenues
not
to
punish
without
fault.
it
would
require
unclouded
language
to
compel
the
conclusion
that
congress
abandoned
the
equitable
policy
observed
for
a
very
long
time
of
relieving
those
who
act
in
good
faith
and
without
negligence.
