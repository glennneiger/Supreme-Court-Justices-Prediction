now,
mrs.
grayson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
question
that
i
want
--
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask,
ms.
grayson.
was
this
used
nationally
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
--
it
was.
not
just
a
local
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
acceptance
company
made
the
inquiry
under
the
wrong
name?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
the
--
did
the
revenue
--
internal
revenue
department
or
the
liquor
department
have
a
record
of
any
kind
of
o-a-t-i-s?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
worth
anything
in
view
of
your
stipulation
from
the
fact
that
you
didn't
raise
it
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
suppose
the
same
inquiry
was
made
of
that
same
office
today
under
the
same
facts
of
this
case.
what
--
what
answer
would
--
would
the
acceptance
company
get?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
they
acted
on
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
is
the
position
of
the
department
administratively
at
the
present
time,
would
that
be
good?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
aren't
you
--
aren't
you
making
a
fetish
of
the
form
rather
than
in
the
substance
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
if
they
--
if
they
would
give
another
--
use
another
form
now
to
--
to
give
the
same
information
to
the
acceptance
corporation
and
you
say
that
one
isn't
good
and
the
other
one
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now,
you
--
you're
just
going
to
make
them
bind
to
anything
else
and
--
and
make
the
form
good?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
it
does
for
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
if
--
if
this
people
would
now
get
a
complete
negative
under
the
same
facts
under
which
they
--
they
got
to
qualify
negative
as
you
say
and
you
--
you
recognized
this
latter
situation
as
complying
with
the
statute.
haven't
you
got
a
distinction
without
a
difference
so
far
as
those
two
forms
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion
with
--
with
a
judge
even
though
the
insurance
company
does
inquire
of
the
liquor
department,
why
do
you
change
your
form
so
as
to
just
give
a
denial?
why
don't
you
--
why
don't
you
change
your
form
so
as
to
say
this
is
a
denial
so
far
as
we're
concerned
but
in
order
to
satisfy
the
statute,
you
must
search
other
places
and
satisfy
yourself.
you're
trying
to
avoid
that,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
you're
willing
to
have
a
defective
affidavit
in
order
to
get
more
business
for
the
alcohol
department?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
you
figure
it
out?
i
don't
understand
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
nature
of
things,
it's
implicit
in
the
--
in
the
form,
your
second
one,
isn't
it
that
they
don't
keep
all
the
state
records
and
therefore
don't
know
everything
that
all
the
--
all
the
state
officers
know?
isn't
that
implicit
in
it
when
they
say
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
there
is
no
reputation
or
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
have
one
minute,
ms.
--
ms.
grayson
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
