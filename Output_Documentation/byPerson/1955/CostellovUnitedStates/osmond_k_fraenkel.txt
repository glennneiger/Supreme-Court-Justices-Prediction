mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
expect
to
take
about
half
of
my
time
in
the
--
of
our
time
in
the
direct
presentation,
leaving
to
mr.
--
my
associate
mr.
shilensky
time
for
rebuttal
after
the
argument
by
the
government.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
prosecution
for
income
tax
frauds,
at
which
the
government
sought
to
convict
the
defendant
and
succeeded
on
the
basis
of
the
net
worth
expenditure
theory
with
which
this
court
is
familiar.
and
the
problems
which
arise
in
that
connection
are
not
here
since
this
court
has
limited
our
certiorari
to
the
one
point
arising
out
of
the
indictment.
the
--
prior
to
the
trial,
the
defendant
had
moved
for
an
inspection
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
saying
was
not
based
on
any
evidence,
that
motion
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
the
papers
were
not
sufficiently
specific.
at
the
trial,
defendant's
counsel
announced
his
intention
of
establishing
there
what
he
had
not
been
able
to
establish
previously,
and
began
questioning
each
witness
who
appeared
at
the
trial,
whether
or
not
that
witness
had
also
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
in
the
beginning,
the
government
objected
and
the
objection
was
sustained,
but
the
summaries
are
not
disclosed.
the
government
did
not
persisted
its
objection,
and
therefore,
all
of
the
witnesses
were
asked,
because
one
of
the
witnesses
as
to
whom
the
objection
was
originally
sustained
was
later
allowed
to
answer
the
same
question.
all
of
these
were
asked,
whether
or
not,
they
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
it
transpired
that
no
one
of
the
witnesses
who
produced
the
large
record,
which
is
before
your
honors,
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
who
had
had
any
personal
transaction
to
whatsoever
with
the
defendant.
not
even
with
the
one
government
agent
by
name
of
her
own
name
who
had
--
had
a
conversation
with
defendant
which
is
in
evidence.
and
there
are
only
three
persons
of
all
those
witnesses
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
who
were
all
government
agents
who
testified
at
the
trial
as
experts
basing
their
testimony
there
of
course,
on
the
testimony
which
had
previously
been
given
at
the
trial
by
various
individuals
who
have
had
personal
transactions
with
the
defendant.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
proof,
the
defendant
again
at
the
trial
moved
the
application
to
dismiss
the
indictment
which
we
denied.
in
the
court
of
appeal,
judge
hand
characterized
the
testimony
at
the
trial
by
saying,
those
who
had
appeared
and
had
had
no
personal
acquaintance
with
costello
or
his
affairs,
they
were
accountants
or
experts,
and
we
find
it
impossible
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
their
computations
must
have
been
based
on
hearsay.
now
--
as
we
view,
this
case
it
rests
on
three
rather
simple
propositions.
first,
the
man
of
the
constitution
for
a
prosecution
of
this
character
and
there's
no
question
that
this
prosecution
comes
within
it's
power
to
describe
in
the
constitution
as
infamous
because
of
the
nature
of
the
punishment
permissible
must
be
prosecuted
by
indictment
means
more
than
a
formal
claiming
of
an
indictment,
a
mere
piece
of
paper.
and
secondly,
that
that
means
that
there
must
be
before
the
grand
jury
some
substantial
competent
evidence.
and
third,
that
there
must
be
a
remedy
in
case
such
a
requirement
be
not
complied
with.
the
only
available
remedy
in
view
of
the
fact
that
an
application
to
dismiss
an
indictment
is
interlocutory
or
not
appealable,
the
only
available
remedy
is,
therefore,
after
conviction,
it
must
result
in
a
reversal.
and
we
think
those
views
having
been
well
expressed
by
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
estelle,
the
estelle
case
which
we
have
cited
on
our
brief
although
this
quotation
does
not
appear
there.
i'm
referring
to
an
almost
identical
provision
of
the
oklahoma
constitution,
that
court
said,
“this
section
of
the
constitution
does
not
mean
an
accusation
in
the
form
of
indictment.
it
does
mean,
a
presentment
or
indictment
found
and
returned
by
a
grand
jury,
legally
selected,
impaneled
and
sworn,
and
upon
competent
evidence
is
authorized
by
law,
and
a
trial
of
a
person
for
such
crime,
without
an
indictment
thus
found
is
in
violation
of
constitutional
right
and
void.”
rather,
concept
that
a
grand
jury
should
act
on
competent
evidence,
to
the
exclusion
of
hearsay,
is
one
well
found
in
american
law.
as
early
as
1831,
the
then
solicitor
general
of
massachusetts,
daniel
davis,
in
a
book
called,
“precedents
of
indictments”
published
that
in
boston
said,
“that
it
is
a
rule
without
an
exception,
that
no
evidence
can
be
admitted
or
received
by
the
grand
jury
which
would
not
be
admitted
on
the
trial
of
the
defendant,
such
as
hearsay
evidence.”
and
that
thought
has
been
voiced
on
numerous
occasions,
by
mr.
justice
field
in
a
charge
to
the
grand
jury
in
california,
by
a
judge
in
boston,
by
another
judge
in
california
more
recently.
it
has
been
voiced
in
statements
in
numerous
federal
decisions.
it
has
actually
resulted
in
the
reversal
of
convictions
and
the
question
of
indictments.
it
is
true
that
in
several
of
the
cases
in
which
that
result
followed,
the
objection
was
not
on
the
basis
of
hearsay
are
such
but
on
the
basis
of
other
disqualification
or
incompetence
of
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
know
officially
only
what
judge
hand
has
told
us,
because
the
defendant
has
not
been
afforded
the
opportunity
to
see
the
grand
jury
minutes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
know
that
the
trial
court
did
see
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
was
going
to
say,
we
know
that
the
trial
court
saw
the
grand
jury
minutes
in
a
different
context.
we
do
not
know
whether
they
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
whether
they
have
been
sent
here.
i
have
been
informed,
i
was
not
present
at
the
trial,
but
i
am
informed
that
when
the
grand
jury
minutes
where
handed
up
at
the
trial,
they
were
a
very
thin
bundle.
nothing
indicating
that
it
--
there
was
readable
actual
testimony
taken.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
we
have
found
no
positive
reclaimant
that
there
must
be
but
modern
practice
is
that
there
is.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
i
don't
suppose
that
that
--
oh,
you
mean
it's
constitutionally
required
that
there
should
be?
certainly,
it
could
be
constitutionally
required.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
don't
think
it's
a
necessity.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
i'm
not
claiming
that
the
constitution
compels
the
taking
of
minutes.
i
--
however,
i
also
see
nothing
in
the
constitution
to
prohibit
congress
from
requiring
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
mr.
justice.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
taking
of
the
minutes
be
required,
but
i
may
say
this.
that
even
in
olden
times,
in
some
of
the
states,
as
my
research
has
indicated,
whether
one
or
minutes
taken,
states
which
have
recognized,
i'm
coming
to
that
shortly,
which
have
recognized
the
principle
for
which
i
am
contending,
and
it
established
a
practice
whereby
that
principle
can
be
vindicated.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
permitted
testimony
by
persons
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
to
show
what
there
was
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
that's
not
this
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
you
have
precisely
before
you
on
the
record,
the
fact
that
no
one
of
a
host
of
witnesses
who
had
various
transactions
with
the
defendant,
including
as
i
said,
the
only
government
agent
who
had
such
transactions,
that
no
--
only
such
persons
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
you
know,
the
three
agents
did
testify.
now,
i
am
frank
to
say,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
establishes
beyond
the
peradventure
of
a
doubt,
whether
there
was
--
may
have
been
someone
else.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
yes.
we
know
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
we
know
the
three
government
agents,
testified
in
both
places.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
we
know
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
know.
we
have
here
before
you
--
you
had
before
you
the
record
of
the
trial
which
indicates
that
these
three
agents
whose
names
were
murphy,
leath,
l-e-a-t-h,
and
(inaudible)
testified.
now,
at
the
trial
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
yes.
you
have
that
--
that's
one
reason.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
will.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
murphy
testified
in
the
main
with
regard
to
the
asset's
net
worth
changes
of
the
defendant
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
various
witnesses,
bank
accounts
and
other
things
of
that
kind.
leath
made
the
overall
summarization
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
various
persons
with
whom
mr.
and
mrs.
costello
had
dealt,
considering
the
expenditures
which
they
had
incurred.
so,
and
he
testified
on
the
basis
of
a
large
exhibit,
which
is
in
the
volume
4
of
the
record,
365
(a),
i
think,
with
several
subsidiary
schedules
which
summarize
that.
in
fact,
the
exhibit
will
indicate
the
basis
of
the
government's
reliance
by
referring
to
witnesses
and
exhibit
numbers.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
exhibit
is
on
page
3,
beginning
on
page
42,
you
have
exhibit
363
and
there's
363a
and
so
on,
those
are
--
you
have
the
expenditures,
the
expenditure's
exhibit
--
schedule
d
of
that
exhibit
begins
on
page
46
of
that
volume.
and
you
will
see
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
small
volume,
volume
4
where
the
pages
are
separately
numbered,
and
that
opens
out,
there
are
several
pages,
three
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
with
all
kinds
of
individuals.
if
your
honor
will
look,
it
starts
out
with
fort

where
a
rental
for

was
paid.

were

various
other
--
liberty

all
kinds
of
suppliers
with
whom
the
defendant
and
his
wife
had
dealings.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
exhibit
was
based
on
the
testimony
of
witnesses
at
the
trial.
witnesses
either
who
had
had
personal
dealings
or
who
produced
records
from
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
entirely.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
your
honors
will
see
for
instance,
301,
the
extreme
right
exhibit
numbers,
which
refers
to
exhibit
numbers
at
the
trial
of
documents
introduced
at
the
trial
by
various
witnesses.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
they
didn't
testify
to
any
hearsay
at
the
trial.
they
testified
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
yes.
but
the
exhibits
--
the
exhibits
were
mere
summaries,
your
honor.
the
exhibits
were
summaries
on
the
basis
of
documents
which
were
properly
in
evidence.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
the
exhibits
for
instance,
your
honor,
would
open
this
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
they
summarized
the
testimony
of
the
other
witnesses.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
and
they
expressed
it.
they
therefore
--
they
--
and
they
gave
a
total
for
instance.
they
said,
the
total
expenditures
as
testified
to
by
all
of
the
other
witnesses
and
as
reflected
on
this
chart
is
so
many
dollars,
and
that
to
the
net
worth
changes.
make
certain
adjustments
in
the
net
worth.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
exhibit
--
this
exhibit
schedule
d,
which
i
have
referred,
this
paper
is
not
hearsay.
this
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
was
clearly
hearsay
before
the
grand
jury.
but
of
course
before
the
grand
jury,
there
was
no
basis
for
it.
at
the
trial,
it
was
not
independent
testimony
at
all.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
was
merely
a
summarization.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
they're
opinions
in
a
sense.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
in
any
cases
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
they
were
admitted
at
the
trial
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
as
summaries
of
things
properly
in
evidence.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
that
--
well
--
not
this
--
not
this
exhibit,
because
it
appears
at
the
trial.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
some
similar
data,
maybe.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
because
--
because
this
data
was
prepared
during
the
trial
as
counsel
for
the
government
said
at
one
stage,
“it
isn't
even
ready
yet,
because
we
have
some
other
witnesses
we
don't
know
about.”
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it
--
it's
a
fair
assumption
that
something
like
that
was
done
here.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
for
sure.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
in
any
case
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
of
course,
this
much
i
must
say
at
the
outset,
there
is
no
case
anywhere
that
i
was
able
to
find
and
i
think
there's
none
that
the
government
is
able
to
find,
which
deals
with
that
precise
situation.
we'd
have
to
take
the
cases
as
we
find
them,
and
the
cases
indicate
this.
in
the
federal
courts,
there
has
been
a
consistent
statement
of
opinion
in
almost
all
of
the
circuits.
that
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
must
be
competent
and
that
an
indictment
should
not
rest
solely
on
incompetent
or
hearsay
evidence.
accompanied
with
some
decisions
as
i
was
indicating,
resulting
in
either
quashing
of
indictments
or
reversals.
generally,
in
terms
of
hearsay,
i
never
specifically
in
the
terms
of
a
limited
variety
of
hearsay
because
that
hasn't
arisen,
in
the
states,
there
is
a
considerable
variety
of
expression,
but
almost
no
case
which
actually
decides
contrary
to
the
position
for
which
we
are
here
contending.
and
a
number
of
cases
which
expressly
adopt
the
point
of
view
for
which
we
are
contending
and
to
rest
it
not
as
the
government
would
seek
that
the
court
believe
because
of
particular
state
statutes
although
such
do
exist.
but
because
of
the
state
courts'
belief,
that
the
constitutional
requirements
compelled
the
result.
thus,
in
new
york,
where
there
is
a
statute
expressly
limiting
the
grand
jury
to
competent
evidence
and
excluding
hearsay,
and
where
the
courts
have
quashed
indictments
based
on
hearsay.
the
court
of
appeals
has
pointed
out
that
that
is
a
rule
based
on
the
constitutional
requirement.
this
power,
said
the
court,
is
based
upon
the
inherent
right
and
duty
of
the
courts,
to
protect
the
citizens
in
his
constitutional
prerogatives
and
to
prevent
oppression
or
persecution.
it
is
a
power
which
the
legislature
couldn't
curtail
nor
abolish,
and
to
the
extent
that
legislative
enactments
are
designed
to
affect
either
of
these
ends,
they
are
unconstitutional,
and
that
was
said
in
connection
with
an
argument.
that,
new
york
law
permitted
an
indictment
to
be
quashed
only
on
certain
grounds
and
this
was
not
among
them.
now,
in
several
of
the
states
that
you
--
has
not
been
followed
and
statutes
limiting
the
quashing
of
indictment
had
been
strictly
construed.
and
in
other
states,
the
courts
have
simply
said,
“we
will
not
concern
ourselves
with
the
problem.
we
will
make
no
inquiry.”
but
we
know
of
no
case
where
the
facts
have
been
developed,
where
a
court
has
refused
to
take
action.
now,
in
alabama,
in
new
york,
in
oklahoma,
there
are
precise
decisions,
reversing
convictions
or
quashing
indictments.
in
several
other
states,
such
as
california,
chief
justice
knows
the
method
is
approached
in
a
somewhat
different
way.
they
--
they
are
used
through
a
prohibition
as
the
basis
for
an
inquiry.
now,
the
extent
of
the
inquiry
permitted
there
is
a
great
deal
from
state
to
state.
but
in
no
state
where
the
general
principle
is
accepted,
is
there
a
denial
of
some
right
of
inquiry?
now
here,
that
problem
does
not
necessarily
arise
because
we
submit
that
the
facts
had
been
exposed
sufficiently
by
what
occurred
at
the
trial.
and
that
we
have
here
somewhat
the
same
kind
of
a
situation
as
exist
in
connection
with
illegal
searches
and
seizures.
now,
that
this
court
can
well
lay
down
a
rule
similar
to
the
one
there
involved,
recognizing
as
it
was
stated
only
this
morning
here,
that
in
the
supervision
of
federal
courts,
this
court
adopts
principles
that
are
not
necessarily
coexistent
with
the
constitution.
so
that,
just
as
there
has
been
held
a
remedy
can
be
devised
to
determine
whether
or
not
evidence
has
been
obtained
with
the
result
of
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
or
unlawful
wiretapping.
the
conviction
based
on
the
use
of
such
illegally
obtained
evidence
will
be
set
aside.
so
here
this
court,
can
likewise
rule,
but
unless
there
is
competent
evidence
before
a
grand
jury,
the
conviction
so
obtained
cannot
stand.
now
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
there
was
no
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
was
no
practical
way
at
the
trial
for
the
defendant
to
develop
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
that
fact.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
because
he
could
do
no
more
than
ask
the
witnesses
who
had
appeared
at
the
trial.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
there
is
one
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
thing
that
is
significant.
the
defendant
made
some
effort
to
find
out
what
at
least
the
witnesses
who
testified
at
the
trial
had
testified
to
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
what
exhibits
were
put
into
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
all
of
those
evidence
were
brought
by
objections
which
were
sustained.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
except
in
one
instance,
where
the
court
overruled
an
objection
presumably
thinking
that
the
answer
of
the
witness
was
going
to
give
was
going
to
be
different
from
the
answer
given.
the
witness
leath
was
asked,
“now,
when
you
testify
before
the
grand
jury,
did
you
base
your
testimony
on
the
exhibits
and
testimony
that
are
in
evidence
here?”
objection
sustained.
did
you
testify
as
to
a
sum
total
of
expenditures?
answer
my
testimony,
sir,
before
the
grand
jury
was.
and
then,
the
court
said,
“why
don't
you
answer
the
question
you
were
asked?”
that
was
a
question
which
objections
--
taken
the
objection
overruled,
and
the
answer
was,
“no.”
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
so
we
have
--
so
we
have
a
witness,
the
witness
who
at
the
trial
testified
to
the
sum
total
of
expenditures
saying
that
before
the
grand
jury
he
hadn't
done
so.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
record
does
not
indicate,
your
honor,
one
way
or
the
other.
i
will
say
this,
that
the
government
has
never
claimed
that
there
were
other
witnesses.
even
in
its
footnote
in
its
brief
here
where
he
talks
about
documents
which
may
have
been
before
the
grand
jury.
it
doesn't
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
those
documents
were
before
the
grand
jury.
in
other
words,
the
government,
which
is
in
possession
of
the
facts
has,
so
to
speak,
played
the
cat
and
mouse
game
with
us.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
we
asked
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
that
forum,
i
don't
think
that
that
precise
formulation
took
place
at
the
trial.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
at
the
very
--
early
part
of
the
trial,
defendant's
lawyer
said
that
he
expected
to
show
that
there
was
no
competent
proof
before
the
grand
jury.
and
that
was
--
that
was
at
the
time
when
his
objections
were
still
being
overruled.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
is
when
he
is
--
when
the
government
objects
throughout
of
being
sustained.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement.
and
i
think
also
that
it
is
clear
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
originally,
the
court
took
the
position
that
what
transpired
before
the
grand
jury
was
a
collateral
issue
and
therefore
not
properly
gone
into
at
the
trial.
and
as
i
say,
when
the
question
first
came
up,
the
government
objected
and
the
court
sustained
the
objection.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
a
motion
to
quash
had
been
made
and
denied.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
on
page
115,
it
simply
said
it
was
objection.
and
then
on
page
126
and
then
on
127
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
volume
1.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
on
page
126
of
the
record,
there's
some
colloquy.
i
certainly
have
a
right
to
interrogate
this
witness
as
to
whether
or
not
he
appeared
before
a
grand
jury.
“that
is
exactly
what
i
have
said
you
have
not
the
right
to
do.
you
and
i
disagree
on
that.
if
you
have
a
ruling,
and
you
may
use
it
wherever
you
think
it
appropriate.”
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
at
the
trial.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
was
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
trial,
a
motion
was
made
on
an
affidavit.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
to
quash
and
to
inspect
the
grand
jurymen's
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
affidavit
was
not
--
the
affidavit,
your
honor,
will
be
--
you
will
find
on
page
83.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
page
83.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
--
83,
in
the
first
volume,
the
affidavit
of
defendant.
he
says,
“your
deformity
is
firmly
convinced
that
there
could
be
no
legal
or
competent
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
which
would
justify
the
indictment.”
at
that
time
of
course,
the
defendant
didn't
know
who
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
since
he
was
denied
access
to
the
grand
jury
minutes,
he
couldn't
particularize.
at
the
trial,
the
defendant's
attorney
asked
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
in
order
to
cross-examine
the
witness,
page
127a,
and
he
said,
“the
court
denied
that,”
so
that
the
defendant
had
never
had
access
to
the
grand
jury
minutes.
although
as
i
stated,
they
were
handed
up
to
the
clerk
for
the
limited
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
testimony
of
a
certain
witness
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
was
inconsistent.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it's
the
practically
universal
custom
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
deny
an
application
for
inspection
of
grand
jury
minutes,
almost
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
he
made
the
application
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
he's
renewed
a
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
before
trial.
and
he
renewed
it
at
the
trial,
it
was
again
denied.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
think
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
think
it's
pretty
general
now.
in
any
case
they
were
recorded
in
this
case,
that
much
is
clear.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
well,
judge
hand,
many,
many
years
ago
said,
“he,
who,
denied
it
and
he
hoped
no
judge
would
ever
grant
such
an
application,”
expressing
a
strange
reluctance
dealing
that
much
information
to
a
defendant
accused
of
crime.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
was
also
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i'm
--
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
was
technically
sufficient
mr.
chief
justice.
i
recognize
that
more
than
that
probably
should
had
been
said,
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
all
it
was
said.
however,
as
judge
hand
pointed
out
in
his
opinion,
an
attempt
was
made
at
trial
to
find
out
the
facts,
and
he
felt
that,
therefore,
the
defendant
had
done
what
he
could
to
find
out
the
facts.
and
since
the
facts
were
disclosed
as
they
were,
the
issue
was
before
the
court
as
i
believe
it
is
here.
the
facts
being
that
you
have
in
effect
what
our
expert
witnesses,
because
the
third
one
of
these
agents,
(inaudible),
testified
as
to
the
tax
that
might
be
due
on
the
basis
of
the
income
which
leath
testified
arose
from
the
expenditures
on
the
basis
of
the
assets
which
murphy
testified
existed.
and
you
have
therefore
three
experts
summarizing
things
without
any
basis
before
the
grand
jury
as
we
firmly
believe
and
there's
nothing
ever
been
suggested
to
the
contrary
to
support
the
testimony
of
those
experts.
and
of
these
cases
that
we've
cited
on
our
prior
brief,
experts
can't
lift
themselves
up
by
their
bootstraps
and
express
opinions
on
facts
that
are
not
previously
found.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
record
didn't
show
categorically
that
no
one
else
were
before
the
grand
jury.
that
i
must
say
what
i
have
then
said
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
there
is
no
way
that
a
defendant
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
can
ever
do
that.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
did
everything
to
find
out.
we
asked
for
the
minutes.
we
questioned
the
witnesses
who
were
there.
and
the
government
has
never,
even
in
argument,
made
a
claim
that
there
was
any
other
witness
before
the
grand
jury.
and
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
the
government
who
have
established
that
that
it
was
a
fact.
i
think
i
will
leave
the
rest
of
the
case
to
my
associate.
