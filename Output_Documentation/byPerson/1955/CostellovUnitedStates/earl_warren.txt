you
have
followed

yourself?
chief

mr.
fraenkel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
was
no
way
of
--
of
indicating
from
this
record
whether
anymore
witnesses
testified
than
these
three
agents
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
--
could
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl

yes.
chief

warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
the
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
question
--
question
that
i
asked
is
this.
do
we
know,
that
these
three
agents
were
the
only
three
witnesses
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury
or
could
there
have
been
others
testified
that
are
not
reflected
in
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
volume
is
that?
chief
justice

chief
justice

warren
is
this

warren
at

trial.
chief
justice

page
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
affidavit
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
affidavit
of
the
defendant
simply
says,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
your
deponent
has
reported
all
of
his
income
for
said
years,
your
deponent
is
firmly
convinced
that
there
could
be
no
legal
or
competent
evidence
before
a
grand
jury
which
would
justify
the
indictment.
is
that
what
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
all
it
was
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
fraenkel.

at
volume

chief
justice

warren
oh,
volume

chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

more
--
more
liberal
rule
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say,
mr.
frankel,
also
that
some
of
this
evidence,
at
least
the
negative
evidence
could
not
be
hearsay,
and
--
and
most
under
any
circumstances
have
been
competent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
why
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
frankel,
would
you
mind
indicating
to
us
those
parts
of
the
testimony
of
these
three
agents
that
you
consider
not
to
be
hearsay?
you
mentioned
--
you
mentioned
the
negative
evidence
where
they
investigated
the
land
records,
the
banks,
and
--
and
the
inheritances
and
things
of
that
--
that
kind
to
show
that
there
--
there
were
none
except
those
that
they
introduced.
now,
what
--
are
there
any
other
phases
of
the
testimony
that
you
consider
are
not
hearsay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shilensky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shilensky,
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
some
of
this
testimony
was
not
hearsay?
do
you
agree
with
them
that
the
negative
testimony
was
not
hearsay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
investigation
of
the
banks
and
the
land
offices
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
investigated
every
bank
in
the
country,
would
they
have
to
bring
a
man
from
every
bank
in
the
company
--
in
the
country
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
say
that
he
had
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
was
evidence
in
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
negative
evidence
was
in
there,
wasn't
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
shilensky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shilensky,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
shilensky,
i
understood
your
associate
yesterday
to
say
that
to
admit
that
the
motion
that
you
made
was
inadequate,
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
because
he
merely
said,
because
i
am
innocent,
there
could
not
have
been
competent
evidence
before
this
grand
jury
and
i
--
i
thought
that
mr.
frank
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
admitted
that
--
that
was
not
an
adequate
motion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
was
talking
about
what
happened
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
they
haven't
introduced
testimony
of
that
kind,
don't
you
believe
he
would
have
argued
that
--
that
the
man
might
have
had
some
bank
accounts
that
even
if
weren't
showed,
he
might
have
had
some
inheritances,
might
have
had
some
land
deals
and
so
forth
that
they
have
it
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
in
many
others'
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
mr.
shilensky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
take
three
minutes
to
summarize
it
well.
