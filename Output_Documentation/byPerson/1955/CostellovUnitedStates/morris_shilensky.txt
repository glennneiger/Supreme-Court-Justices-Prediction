mr.
morris
shilensky
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
take
the
holt
case
first
because
it
was
last
mentioned.
that
case
stands
for
the
principle
which
is
the
only
principle
that
stands
for,
that
when
there
is
some
competent
evidence
and
some
incompetent
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
the
courts
will
not
undertake
to
determine
as
they
do
before
petit
juries,
whether
the
incompetent
evidence
influenced
the
grand
jury.
now,
the
very
proof
that
there
was
sufficient
competent
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
in
the
holt
case
was
that
holt
was
convicted
at
the
trial,
without
the
confessions.
so
obviously,
there
existed
and
i
of
course
don't
know
whether
that
was
before
the
grand
jury
in
the
holt
case,
but
there
existed
competent
evidence
other
than
his
confession
on
which
the
grand
jury
could
have
acted.
and
the
opinion
on
the
holt
case
of
course
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
all
the
court
was
deciding
that
it
could
not
undertake
to
sift
out
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
to
determine
whether
the
bad
affected
the
grand
jury.
in
this
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes,
i
would
say
that.
now
in
this
case,
the
court
below
recognized,
that
if
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
i'm
not
discussing
where
there's
(inaudible)
or
an
income,
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
the
indictment
can't
stand
because
it
has
no
beginning.
mr.
morris
shilensky
you
mean
in
the
holt
case,
your
honor?
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
i
--
i
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
but
when
it
acts
on
its
own
information,
your
honor,
historically,
it
acted
on
its
oath
that
they
knew
the
facts.
they
took
an
oath.
this
goes
back
historically
and
i
don't
think
it's
true
in
this
country
anymore
because
of
the
complexity
of
society.
i
don't
think
grand
juries
are
on
the
position
to
act
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
--
but
historically
when
the
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
oh,
imagine
sir,
but
where
they
do
act
on
their
own
knowledge,
it
is
on
their
oath
that
they
know
something
to
be
so,
and
they
as
it
were,
the
juror
who
knows
it
testifies
as
it
were
to
his
brethren
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
morris
shilensky
sometimes
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes.
sometimes,
i
guess
they
did
that.
now,
in
this
case
your
honor
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
would
say
that
the
testimony,
negative
testimony
that
no
gift
tax
return
was
filed,
if
made
by
an
agent
who
is
in
a
position
to
check
that
is
not
hearsay
but
not
at
the
substance
of
crime.
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
the
banks,
your
honor.
if
one
wants
to
prove
that
a
bank,
a
particular
bank
has
no
account
for
mr.
costello,
you
call
an
officer
of
the
bank
where
you
produce
their
books,
or
you
have
someone
who
knows
it.
these
agents
acted
on
a
letter.
they
wrote
a
letter
to
a
bank
and
said,
“do
you
have
an
account
to
mr.
costello?”
and
the
bank
will
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
no.
mr.
morris
shilensky
no.
because
the
negative
proof
is
of
no
great
consequence,
your
honor.
the
affirmative
proof
is
the
thing
that
turned
--
that
turn
into
a
trick
in
this
case.
mr.
morris
shilensky
the
affirmative
evidence
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
--
at
the
trial?
mr.
morris
shilensky
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
shilensky
oh,
yes.
but
it
did
not
turn
that
--
it
was
no
more
than
just
excluding
possibilities,
your
honor.
it
didn't
turn
the
case,
couldn't
have.
mr.
morris
shilensky
please.
i've
had
the
exceptional
opportunity
to
being
able
to
prepare
my
argument
as
an
answer
to
the
court's
questions
which
were
opposed
during
yesterday's
session.
i
will
proceed
through
it
rather
rapidly
because
i'd
like
to
leave
sometime
for
further
questions
by
the
court
after
my
prepared
presentation.
before
proceeding,
however,
to
answer
the
several
questions,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there's
been
a
tremendous
narrowing
of
the
issue
on
this
appeal.
originally,
it
was
argued
by
the
solicitor
as
he
did
in
his
brief
that
the
grand
jury
is
a
powerful
secret
largely
uncontrolled
body
whose
indictment
is
not
reviewable
by
the
courts.
this
was
based
in
part
on
judge
hand's
statement
of
1910,
that
the
grand
jury
was
an
irresponsible
utterance
of
the
community
at
large.
but
now,
judge
hand,
in
the
opinion
below
and
my
adversaries,
had
recognized
that
on
a
proper
showing,
such
as
that
the
indictments
based
on
new
evidence
or
an
indictment
which
is
based
on
so-called
the
aggravated
hearsay
like
a
police
officer
testifying
that
someone
told
him
that
the
indictee
was
the
murderer,
and
those
cases,
the
courts
must
set
aside
the
indictment.
in
other
words,
the
grand
jury
is
like
all
other
agencies,
judicial
and
otherwise,
provided
for
under
the
constitution
and
they
are
governed
by
rules
and
it
is
not
in
an
artistic
body,
thus,
if
a
grand
jury's
indictment
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
no.
i
--
i
didn't
say
that.
i
say
that
he
didn't
mean
that
because
as
he
later
said
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
well,
he
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
--
he
regard
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
agree
with
that.
if
the
grand
jury's
indictment
is
presumed
to
be
a
finding
of
probable
cause,
it
is
at
least
not
conclusive
as
the
solicitor
per
se.
now,
we
then
proceed
to
the
question
as
to
what
showing
a
defendant
must
make
in
order
to
invoke
the
supervision
of
the
courts.
that
leads
me
to
mr.
justice
reed's
question
as
to
whether
we
ask
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
during
the
trial,
we
did.
at
page
135
of
volume
1,
at
that
time,
the
agent
(inaudible)
was
on
the
stand.
he
was
the
one
agent
who
was
in
a
position
to
testify
to
something
which
wasn't
hearsay
because
he
talked
to
the
defendant
in
1939.
but
he
wasn't
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
we
didn't
know
it
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
we
said
to
the
court,
look
at
the
minutes,
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
court
during
the
recess
said,
after
recess,
i
advice
you
that
i
have
read
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
i
state
to
you
that
i
find
no
contradiction
on
the
grand
jury
minutes
with
anything
that
this
witness
has
said,
no
suggestion
that
the
witness
had
not
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
the
judge
merely
said,
i
read
the
minutes
and
there's
no
contradiction
somewhat
cue.
our
counsel
said,
defendant's
counsel
said,
"i
offer
to
prove,
your
honor,
that
this
witness
was
not
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
courts
that
i
declined
to
accept
the
offer
because
i
think
it's
immaterial."
and
then
counsel
had
ought
to
say,
"i
made
a
motion
before
i
may
explain
to
your
honor
in
this
case
from
inspection
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
competent
evidence
before
this
grand
jury."
the
court
said,
"was
the
motion
decided?"
"yes,
i
was
refused
the
grand
jury
minutes."
then
your
record
is
protected.
counsel
persists
that
i
expect
to
show
during
the
course
of
this
trial
that
there
was
no
competent
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
from
which
this
indictment
is
based.
and
the
court
said,
"you
have
offered
to
do
that,
but
i
shall
decline
to
accept
the
offer
of
proof,
because
it
is
not
an
issue
before
this
jury,
whether
or
not,
the
indictment
was
based
on
competent
evidence
before
the
grand
jury."
your
motion
which
was
denied
summons
the
law
on
that
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
and
your
record
is
protected.
even
then,
of
course,
we
didn't
know
that
the
witness
of
that
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
later,
and
we
profess
further,
the
government
conceded
that
that
witness,
the
one
agent
who
had
interviewed
the
defendant
had
not
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
we
moved
at
every
stage
of
the
case
and
every
opportunity
we
have
to
urge
that
the
grand
jury
have
acted
without
legal
basis
but
to
no
avail,
and
as
judge
hand
said,
at
153
of
the
record,
the
defendant
had
done
all
he
could
to
raise
the
point.
mr.
morris
shilensky
at
the
time
the
motion
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
at
the
time
the
motion
was
made
before
trial,
your
honor,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record,
because
we
didn't
have
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
show
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
had
any
testimony.
at
--
simultaneously,
with
that
motion,
the
defendant
asked
for
the
grand
jury
minutes.
now,
later
at
the
trial,
i
think
there
were
six
occasions,
your
honor,
drops
by
when
the
motion
was
made,
both
during
and
after
the
trial,
when
it
was
known
who
the
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
were.
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes.
mr.
morris
shilensky
before
the
trial,
before
the
trial,
the
affidavit
could
not
say
what
the
grand
jury
it
had
because
the
defendant
had
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
i
would
say
it's
one
by
the
court,
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
should
be
determined
by
the
court
and
not
by
the
jury.
the
court
could
have
cause
--
maybe
the
motions
were
made
to
the
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
--
not
to
the
jury.
mr.
morris
shilensky
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
narrow
question,
your
honors,
because
you
have
permitted
us
to
come
up
on
the
broader
question.
i
say
this
that
if
--
and
i'd
like
to
refer
for
a
moment
to
the
second
circuit
decisions.
we
say
this,
that
either
we
are
given
the
minutes
or
we
are
not
punished
for
not
having
them,
now,
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
against
(inaudible)
and
just
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes.
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes.
well
we
can't
say
here,
we
can't
say
here
that
your
honors
could
reverse
merely
because
we
didn't
get
the
minutes.
so,
i
think
that's
direct
answer
to
your
question.and
we
would
not
ask
you
to
reverse
merely
because
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
your
honor
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
may
i
say
this
your
honors,
that
i
don't
think
that
your
decision
so
far
have
gone
that
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
minutes
after
he
has
been
presented
to
the
court,
after
he's
been
apprehended.
and
the
case
has
won
on
the
way
or
practically
over
and
he
raises
a
point
timely.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
your
honors
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
secrecy
must
prevail
at
that
stage.
mr.
morris
shilensky
you
have
done
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
shilensky
and
the
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes.
mr.
morris
shilensky
well,
your
honor,
we
prove
the
no
proper
evidence
suggest
this
way.
we
have
shown
affirmatively
what
was
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes,
the
three
witnesses.
we
have
indulged
in
the
presumption.
mr.
morris
shilensky
we
wouldn't
know
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
we
say
this
your
honor,
that
where
we
are
denied
the
minutes
by
the
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
--
agency
which
has
the
minutes
and
can
come
forward
and
say
--
ah,
but
there
is
one
fourth
witness
and
tell
us
who
the
fourth
witness,
tell
the
court.
i'll
come
to
that,
your
honor,
because
i
have
some
just
a
little
to
say
on
that
in
proper
order,
if
i
may.
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
your
honors,
there
surely
comes
a
time
when
a
defendant
has
laid
out
a
case
which
calls
the
court
to
review
what
the
grand
jury
has
done.
i
think
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
morris
shilensky
now,
whether
we
have
gone
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
think
in
a
whole
case,
your
honor,
insofar
as
it
said
that
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
there
was
no
competent
evidence
entitles
the
indictment
to
be
upheld.
mr.
morris
shilensky
your
honor,
that
is
a
fair
holding
because
what
they
said
in
the
whole
case
was
that
they
would
not
set
it
aside
because
of
the
improper
testimony
which
went
in
along
with
the
competent
testimony.
mr.
morris
shilensky
he
could
say
that.
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
--
i
think
he
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
think
he
did
that.
mr.
morris
shilensky
now,
the
question
then,
i
proceed
to
is
did
this
defendant
do
as
hand
says,
everything
he
could
possibly
do,
to
invoke
the
aid
of
the
court.
now,
he
said
that
we
find
that
it's
impossible
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
there,
meaning
the
witnesses
computations
must
have
been
based
on
hearsay.
judge
frank
in
his
concurring
opinion
says,
"here
we
have
a
grand
jury
returning
an
indictment
on
the
basis
of
evidence
which,
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant,
could
properly
--
could
not
properly
be
received
at
the
trial."
now,
we
are
asked
to
assume,
as
i
said
before,
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
but
we
can
safely
to
go
along
with
it,
that
the
three
witnesses
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
testified
precisely
as
they
did
at
the
trial,
no
more,
no
less,
that's
when
we're
asked
to
do.
now,
in
that
respect,
i
think
my
adversary
has
led
himself
down
the
golden
path,
because
he
swore
in
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court.
a
directional
arrow
to
a
bed
of
roses.
he
left
the
impression,
and
i'm
sure
it
wasn't
delivered
that
the
agents
here
say,
in
this
case,
was
almost
the
shuffle
kind.
the
witness
who
reports
what
he
saw
in
books,
records,
and
the
like
and
that
the
testimony
was
of
that
nature
before
the
great
--before
the
trial
court
and
therefore,
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
it
wasn't
anything
of
the
kind
and
we'll
take
briefly
each
of
the
three
witnesses.
so,
merely
at
the
trial
made
a
calculation
on
a
tax
return
supply
and
he
said,
"if
you
assume
as
income
of
mr.
and
mrs.
costello
that
that
was
joined
(inaudible),
the
money
they
spent
to
get
what
the
--
to
show
they
earned
but
you
put
in
the
incomes
figure
the
money
they
spent
or
invested
and
then
you
calculate
the
tax,
you
come
to
x
thousands
of
dollars
that
they
owe
the
government.
that's
all
that
was
assumed
here.
and
that's
not
shuffled
or
anything
of
a
kind,
so
that's
the
very
testimony
with
calculation
almost
then.
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
i
think
there
are
three
witnesses,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
shilensky
this
witness
--
this
witness.
mr.
morris
shilensky
that's
right
and
now
the
next
witness.
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes.
mr.
morris
shilensky
he
would
be
--
be
clear
for
it.
he
said
if
you
assume
that
its
income,
this
is
the
tax.
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes
--
yes,
parts
of
the
trial.
mr.
morris
shilensky
but
he
didn't
testify,
he
asked
--but
he
didn't
even
say
--
he
didn't
even
say,
if
you
assume
the
witness'
testimony
is
correct,
this
were
the
tax.
he
said,
if
you
assume
that
the
income
was
equal
to
their
expenditure
of
this
with
the
tax,
truly,
mathematical
calculation
by
an
expert,
well,
who'll
argue
with
myself
and
my
tax
return
and
--
and
there
would
be
many
--
other
people
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
morris
shilensky
your
honor,
i
would
it
all,
i
think
it
approaches
the
constitutional
thing.
it
surely
--
it
surely
comes
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
supervisory
powers.
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes,
your
honor,
if
by
this
court
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
wouldn't
say
by
this
court
except
to
the
extent
inferred
than
there
is
the
reservation
in
the
whole
case
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
--
except
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
i
would
say
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes.
very
briefly
done,
your
honor,
because
of
the
limit
of
this.
now,
may
i
finish
with
these
three
witnesses
briefly?
now,
murphy
testified
that
he
wrote
to
the
banks
and
they
replied
that
they
had
no
accounts
with
the
--
these
dollars.
hearsay,
if
there
had
a
law,
so
to
say,
letters
to
and
from
people
think
that
was
a
point
of
any
importance,
it
would
have
been
objected
there
at
the
trial.
the
fact
that
we
didn't
object
to
it
at
the
trial
doesn't
make
any
less
hearsay.
and
then
he
went
on
to
testify
for
three
things,
that
he
checked
the
records
and
there
were
no
gift
tax
returns,
that
he
checked
real
estate
land
records
and
filed
no
real
estate
acceptance
on
the
exceptions,
and
that
there
were
no
inheritances.
nobody
said
there
were
any
of
those
three
things.
there
was
no
contention
to
that
and
so
little
effect
with
that
negative
testimony
he
have
that
judge
hand
and
judge
frank
didn't
even
think
of
worthwhile
mentioning
this
when
they
put
all
of
the
testimony
into
the
category
of
hearsay
testimony.
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
don't
think
we
could
have
argue
with
your
honors
opinion
on
the
holland
case.
mr.
morris
shilensky
in
the
holland
case,
i
--
i
think
we
wouldn't
have
been
foreclosed
because
you
said
there
that
the
government
has
to
follow
down
leads
given
by
the
defendant
and
exclude
with
which
they
reasonably
can,
only
if
they
reasonably
can
do
it
and
exclude
the
possibility
or
the
likelihood
that
the
funds
spent
came
from
those
sources.
now,
if
there
is
no
lead
given
by
the
defendant,
there's
no
necessity
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
exclude
land
inheritance
and
other
things
no
suggestion
on
the
case.in
any
event,
judge
hand
studied
this
point
because
the
decision
was
based
on
that
thought
so
little
of
this
evidence
that
he
didn't
even
mentioned
it.
and
it
was
very
insignificant
at
the
trial,
it
wasn't
contested,
it
wasn't
assumed
in
the
cases.
now
(inaudible)
was
a
special
--
special
agent.
mr.
morris
shilensky
i
don't
hold
it
against
them
that
they
did
that,
your
honor,
but
i
say
that
that
kind
of
testimony,
even
in
its
negative
character
if
it
could
be
classified
as
not
hearsay
adds
nothing
to
the
basis
for
the
indictment.
they
might
have
testified
to
other
facts
which
had
no
bearing
on
the
crime.
they
might
have
had
in
a
rebuttal
case.
but
the
affirmative
crime,
the
affirmative
evidence
it
required
didn't
involve
establishing
that
he
didn't
receive
any
inheritance,
no
such
testimony.
now
(inaudible)
was
a
special
--
special
agent.
he
was
charged
and
this
is
the
policy
question,
he
was
charged
under
the
law
with
making
a
recommendation
of
indictment,
that's
his
job,
and
he
is
the
witness
who
goes
before
the
grand
jury
and
testifies
as
to
one.
let's
assume
again
that
his
testimony
is
the
same
at
the
trial.
he
doesn't
testify
that
he
went
to
books
and
records
at
the
trial
and
found
(inaudible)
bills
and
other
bills.
he
doesn't
testified
at
all.
he
says,
"i
made
up
a
chart.
i
listened
to
the
witnesses
in
court
and
i
looked
at
the
exhibits
which
were
introduced
in
court,
and
i
just
jotted
them
down.
i
added
them
up,
i
subtract
the
certain
things,
i
multiplied
and
i
did
other
things
and
here's
the
end
result."
now
clearly,
if
that
testimony
would
have
been
adduced
without
the
supporting
witnesses,
your
honors
would
have
treated
it
as
you
did
in
the
holland
--
as
you
said
you
would
in
the
holland
case,
when
you
said
that
these
charts
may
go
before
a
jury
with
very
strict
instructions
by
the
court
that
they
don't
acquire
an
existence
of
their
own,
independent
of
the
evidence
which
gives
rise
to
them.
they
were
charts.
some
reasons
of
what
the
witnesses
have
testified
to,
not
the
expert
witnesses
recollection
or
recalling
or
copying
out
of
what
he
sort
in
multitudes
of
records
which
might
be
some
extension
of
the
shuffle
thing.
that
was
not
these
witnesses
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
it's
--
all
testimony
too
your
honor.
mr.
morris
shilensky
all
testimony
too
and
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes,
they
did.
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
shilensky
i'll
give
you
a
kind.
a
barber
testified
--
a
barber
testified
at
the
trial
that
mr.
costello
came
in
everyday
for
a
shave,
came
in
once
a
week,
i
think,
for
a
haircut,
and
so
and
so
often
for
a
manicure.
and
then
he
said,
i
don't
remember
just
what
it
was
but
my
prices
were
$1.25
shave
and
haircuts
such
and
such
a
period
and
then
he
made
the
calculation
and
he
said,
therefore,
it
must
be
x
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
--
hundreds
of
dollars
a
year.
mr.
morris
shilensky
the
total
items
of
that
type
of
testimony,
your
honor,
was
$23,000,
that
the
barber
recalled.
mr.
morris
shilensky
oh,
i
don't
remember
a
figure
but
my
associate
would
know.
mr.
morris
shilensky
there
were
some
brokers
figures
but
there
was
$23,000,
your
honor,
of
mr.
costello
spending
which
didn't
have
a
shred
of
record.
nothing.
mr.
morris
shilensky
the
amount
of
evasion
that
you
include,
if
you
include
mrs.
costello's,
now
i'll
get
to
that
because
that's
$105,000
that
the
total
amount
they
prove
in
the
four
years
was
$300,000
and
some
more
thousand
dollars
of
expenditure.
mr.
morris
shilensky
but
much
was
reported
in
the
tax
return.
mr.
morris
shilensky
a
very
substantial
portion.
mr.
morris
shilensky
i'll
have
the
figure
in
a
moment,
your
honor,
because
i
didn't
make
the
calculation
that
way
but
i'd
like
to
say
this
that
it
was
well
over
a
theory
of
the
total
for
the
four
years.
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
i'd
say
not.
mr.
morris
shilensky
i'd
say
--
before
--
they
had
before
they
came
to
trial.
mr.
morris
shilensky
oh,
yes
in
preparation
for
the
trial,
they
undoubtedly
had
choice.
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
not
way
back.
not
way
back
because
--
mr.
morris
shilensky
no,
i
think
it's
unfair
to
say
that.
mr.
morris
shilensky
yes,
one
of
these
reasons,
that
when
they
went
in
for
an
indictment,
when
they
went
in
for
an
indictment,
your
honor,
they
came
out
with
the
indictment
--
i
see
my
time's
up.
mr.
morris
shilensky
the
--
when
they
came
out
with
the
indictment,
it
was
the
14th
of
march,
the
day
before
the
statute
of
limitation
were
in.
and
it's
true
the
one
witness
testified
they've
been
working
on
it
for
months,
but
they
continued
working
on
it
afterwards
and
the
figures
of
the
trial
differed
widely
from
the
figures
of
the
indictment.
and
--
and
therefore,
i
say,
that
there
was
much
between
the
date
of
the
indictment
and
the
(inaudible)
mr.
morris
shilensky
well,
may
i
say
a
concluding
sentence.
mr.
morris
shilensky
there's
one
other
item
and
then
just
one
sentence
of
course.
the
expenditures
of
mrs.costello
were
$105,000.
there
was
no
record
connection
between
mrs.
costello
and
mr.
costello.her
expenditures
were
charged
disavowed,
he
gave
her
the
money
without
any
records
to
show
that.
but
there
was
testimony
at
the
trial
of
witnesses,
the
lawyer
and
a
couple
of
other
people
of
the
court
whose
testimony,
the
government
argued,
entitled
the
jury
to
tie
in
that
$105,000
to
mr.
costello.
that
couldn't
be
before
the
grand
jury.
it
would
be
impossible.
now,
the
concluding
part
is
this,
your
honors.
if
you
had
any
misgivings
about
accepting
judge
hand's
finding
that
there
was
only
hearsay,
the
grand
jury
minutes,
i
suggest,
should
be
ordered
and
filed
in
this
court
so
it
could
be
printed
and
become
a
part
of
this
record,
and
then
we
could
see
whether
it
is
as
judge
hand
found
for
a
hearsay.
now,
whether
it's
competent
to
support
the
indictment
or
as
you
did
in
the
remmer
case
and
on
another
occasions,
you
send
it
back
to
the
court
and
say,
"look
at
these
minutes.
report
are
these
minutes
hearsay?"
or
is
it
of
such
great
value
of
evidence
that
we
were
not
going
to
disturb
it,
as
of
--
stands
down.
this
case
stands
for
the
principle
that
hearsay
evidence
by
agents
who
are
charged
with
seeking
an
indictment,
it's
their
duty,
unsupported
by
any
facts,
may
support
an
indictment
and
the
constitutional
provision
for
an
indictment
is
no
protection
at
all.
