which
volume?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
that
they
produce
evidence
in
connection
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
--
whether
you
were
there
or
not
as
counsel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
way
--
in
what
way
did
the
defendant
seek
to
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
was
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
objection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
the
ground
upon
which
the
court
refused
to
permit
the
defendant
to
bring
that
before
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
on
the
ground
that
it
should've
been
more
previously
by
a
motion
to
quash
or
some
other
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effort
was
made
before
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
quash?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
in
the
affidavit
--
what
did
the
affidavit
setout
if
nothing
had
been
offered
except
hearsay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
rule
of
that
--
about
being
confronted
by
the
witnesses
against
him,
is
that
hearsay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
draw
any
distinction
between
the
rights
to
be
confronted
--
have
the
witnesses
confronts
you
in
connection
with
an
indictment
in
connection
with
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
have
you
looked
into
the
cases
sufficiently
to
know
whether
in
this
country,
either
in
colonial
trials
or
since,
grand
juries
have
been
permitted
to
act
on
their
own
knowledge
without
regard
to
any
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
it's
necessary
for
you
to
assume
that
those
for
me,
it's
very
few,
to
assume
that
you
could
convict
the
man
on
this
evidence,
on
this
--
this
statement,
they
did
missed
him
without
confronting
him
with
the
equipments,
in
a
trial
for
his
liberty
or
his
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
your
argument
when
you
limit
it
to
the
grand
jury
better
than
i
care
when
you
appeared
to
take
the
position
that
they
--
somehow
they
get
to
--
be
a
sanctity
about
the
fact
that
someone
is
looking
at
some
books.
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
the
one
the
man
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know.
i
only
want
you
to
consider
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
this
myself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury
indictments.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
probably
also
would
be
different
if
you
don't
speak
in
terms
of
hearsay
as
to
speak
in
terms
of
being
confronted
by
the
witnesses,
between
offering
a
summary
of
bookkeeping
facts
such
in
a
civil
case
and
in
a
criminal
case
where
you're
going
to
take
somebody's
liberty
in
his
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
suggest
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
one
other
question
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
would
ask
you
some
more.
do
we
have
to
assume
here
that
the
only
evidence,
it
was
all
of
the
evidence
of
these
three
papers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
there's
an
assumption
--
a
presumption
that
there
was
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
upon
whom
does
the
burden
rests
in
connection
with
the
challenge
for
the
grand
jury
and
to
what
evidence
is
offered
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
we
to
assume
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
accept
that,
i'm
not
saying
whether
we
should
or
not
but
if
we
do
accept
it,
certainly
there
should
be
some
way
for
him
to
make
a
motion
and
summon
witnesses
and
prove
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
stand
on
that
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
enough
evidence
so
that
the
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
--
we
find
that
there
was
a
reasonable
ground
at
least
he
was
guilty
of
this
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
indicate
that
was
based
on
the
constitutional
rule
on
a
court-made
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
--
i
was
just
wondering
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
commonly,
for
a
long
time
at
least,
it
was
thought
that
the
grand
jury
couldn't
act
on
its
own
information?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
some
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
places
in
the
country,
they
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
intending,
are
you
that
this
issue
is
a
valid
issue,
it's
one
to
be
tried
by
the
jury
which
determines
the
guilt
for
innocent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
assuming
that
this
was
all
that
you
say
within
your
definition.
are
you
invoking
a
constitutional
rule
or
rules
made
by
the
court
that
you
provide
for
the
capacity
over
the
trial
of
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
assuming
then
that
there
that
i'm
--
at
this
time,
i,
by
no
means
sure
that
your
constitutional
point
is
so
strong.
assuming
that
if
it's
--
you're
invoking
an
application
of
a
rule
in
those
statutes,
do
you
claim
that
there
has
been
up
to
this
date
a
rule
established
to
that
character
which
is
controlling
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
whole
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
whole
case
cited
within
to
the
belief
that
this
court
is
fair
with
acting
on
with
the
assumption
the
grand
jury
that
best
perform
its
function
if
after
its
indictment
will
return,
it
was
led
alone,
i
would
think.
but
assuming
now
that
there
has
been
no
rule,
do
you
--
are
you
reserving
time
to
argue
it
that
which
would
have
to
come
and
i
would
say,
the
policy,
is
it
good
or
bad?
and
if
so,
why?
