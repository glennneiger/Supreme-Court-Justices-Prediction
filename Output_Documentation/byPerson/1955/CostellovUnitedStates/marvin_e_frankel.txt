mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
plan
to
devote
the
bulk
of
these
oral
presentations
to
what
i
hope
will
be
answers
to
questions
put
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i'm
anxious
that
the
court
didn't
have
a
concrete
picture
of
what
was
proved
at
the
trial
in
this
case,
and
what
we
know
or
must
necessarily
assume
was
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
in
this
four-volume
record,
you
have
the
record
of
a
five
week
trial
that
reflects
the
most
painstaking,
laborious,
detailed
kind
of
investigation
extending
over
months
and
years
into
the
court
long
and
difficult
to
ascertain
financial
affairs
of
mr.
costello.
this
case
is
a
careful
structure
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
little
bits
of
evidence.
no
one
or
10
or
50
of
which
are
in
themselves
at
all
incriminating.
no
one
or
10
or
50
of
the
140
witnesses
at
this
trial
could
have
established
the
government's
case
against
frank
costello.
it
is
plain
as
day
from
the
most
cursory
examination
of
this
case
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
government
with
hope
and
suspicion
only
went
before
a
grand
jury
to
get
an
indictment
hoping
to
get
the
evidence
later.
it
is
clear
as
day
that
the
evidence
was
all
known
and
all
had
been
carefully
sifted
before
the
internal
revenue
service
recommended
prosecution,
department
of
justice
agreed
with
that
recommendation.
and
the
grand
jury
believed
on
the
presentation
made
before
it
that
costello
should
be
brought
to
trial
for
attempted
tax
evasion.
now,
leaving
aside
for
just
a
moment
the
testimony
of
these
three
agents
about
which
i
plan
to
speak
at
length.
what
was
there
in
this
record?
what
was
produced
by
these
140
odd
witnesses?
i'd
like
to
turn
again
to
the
exhibits
referred
to
by
mr.
fraenkel
in
his
argument.
first,
to
page
42
of
volume
4
of
the
record,
government's
exhibit
363.
the
court
will
see
there
that
the
basis
for
the
inference
of
unrecorded
income
is
two
things,
a
total
of
net
worth
increases
in
two
of
the
four
prosecution
years,
these
with
decreases,
and
very
large
annual
expenditures
by
costello
and
his
wife.
you
will
see
too
examining
this
exhibit
that
the
heart
of
the
government's
case,
in
the
sense
of
putting
over
and
establishing
clearly
these
huge
excess
and
available
assets,
the
heart
of
the
case
was
the
expenditures.
and
now,
if
you
will
turn
to
page
46
of
this
same
volume,
you
will
get
a
bird's
eye
view
on
this
page
and
the
pages
following
of
these
expenditures.
mr.
fraenkel
has
referred
to
then.
you
will
see
that
these
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
volume
4,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
volume
4
and
at
this
exhibit
363d
on
page
46
of
volume
4
which
opens
that.
you
will
see
that
the
103
witnesses
whose
testimony
is
summarized
on
this
exhibit,
each
in
turn
came
from
a
store,
a
merchant,
a
dentist,
a
doctor,
somebody
who
had
received
money
from
costello
or
his
wife
for
goods
and
services.
you
will
see
that
each
item,
practically
without
exception
is
a
relatively
small
one,
a
few
hundred
dollars,
some
as
little
as
$15.
and
you
will
see
from
this
and
from
the
testimony
on
which
it
is
based
that
these
represents
a
series
of
witnesses
for
some
four
weeks,
one
after
the
other,
bringing
through
the
trial
jury
the
records
from
macy's,
in
b.
altman's,
and
the
doctor,
and
the
maid,
and
so
on.
in
some
cases
they
were
not
records.
in
most,
they
were.
adding
up
these
figures,
no
one
item
of
testimony,
no
20
or
50
items
at
all
incriminating,
each
are
simply
clear,
simple,
and
unquestioned
demonstration
that
costello
had
spent
so
much
and
so
much
money
with
this
merchant
or
that
person
who
rendered
service.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'm
turning
to
that
now.
i'm
turning
now
to
precisely
that
question
and
i'm
turning
to
the
knowledge
of
these
three
agents
who
we
know
did
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
now
very
quickly,
almost
as
quickly
as
i
can
say
it,
you
can
find
the
summary
of
that
knowledge,
beginning
at
page
1382
of
the
record,
that's
in
volume
3,
1382,
the
testimony
of
agent
murphy.
and
if
you
read
the
eight
or
nine
or
10
pages,
beginning
with
1382,
you
will
find
this.
that
these
gentlemen
were
not
merely
--
had
not
merely
been
accountants
who
were
able
to
tell
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury
of
the
niceties
of
accounting,
and
were
able
to
give
expert
testimony
only
in
that
sense.
these
are
special
agents,
the
government's
investigators
in
this
kind
of
case.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
indictment
was
found,
your
honor,
in
march
of
1953,
and
i
believe
the
trial
begins
early
in
1954,
in
april
of
1954,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
can
remember
only
one,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
first,
agent
murphy
who,
right
here
on
page
1382
says,
his
investigation,
his
assignment
to
the
case
was
in
june,
1952,
approximately
10
months
before
the
indictment
was
returned.
but
i
think
there
will
be
no
quarrel
with
this,
that
the
record
showed
by
the
kind
of
material
in
the
record
that
costello's
affairs
had
been
under
investigation
often
on
for
sometime
before
this.
the
record
contains
among
other
things
a
statement
to
a
treasury
agent
going
back
to
1937.
and
the
information
in
the
record
covers
that
whole
period
from
1937
through
1949,
the
whole
picture
of
his
financial
history.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that
agent
murphy
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
should
think
so
your
honor,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right
your
honor.
i
think
the
--
i've
suggested
and
i
--
i
don't
know
but
i
don't
think
there'll
be
any
disagreement
on
it
that
this
is
a
picture
of
an
investigation
that
had
preceded
by
sometime
even
that.
but
there,
you
have
at
least
nine
months
from
my
quick
reference
to
this
page
in
my
offhand
memory.
now,
what
did
these
agents
know?
what
knowledge
did
they
have
to
the
grand
jury?
murphy
testified,
they
had
searched
and
located
all
the
assets
and
liabilities
of
costello
and
his
wife.
they
had
circularized
hundreds
of
banks
in
new
york,
arkansas,
florida,
louisiana,
and
brokerage
houses
to
find
where
costello
had
assets,
and
--
and
this
is
important
under
the
court's
recent
net
worth
decisions,
where
costello
didn't
have
assets.
they
had
searched
real
estate
records,
to
find
what
real
estate,
if
any,
the
costellos
own,
and
they
had
found
three
parcels,
not
more
an
important
fact.
they
had
searched
surrogates
records
and
other
pertinent
records
to
find
what
inheritances
if
any
the
costellos
had
have,
and
they
found
one
small
one
and
no
other.
and
as
the
court
knows,
the
availability
of
nontaxable
receipts
like
inheritances
is
an
important
question
in
this
kind
of
net
worth
expenditures
proof.
now
finally,
these
agents
had
tracked
down
all
of
these
minute
numerous
expenditures
of
the
costellos.
the
ladies
and
gentlemen,
from
macy's
and
b.
altman's
and
the
other
places
didn't
accidentally
show
up
at
this
trial.
they
had
all
been
interviewed
and
they
were
evidence
discovered
obviously
by
these
agents,
and
murphy
so
testified
at
the
trial.
now,
these
then
was
the
knowledge
that
the
agents
had
before
the
grand
jury.
and
i
might
interpolate
here
that
i
think
there
will
be
no
quarrel
with
our
assumption
that
the
agents
gave
to
the
grand
jury,
intelligently
and
as
fully
as
the
grand
jury
required
through
its
understanding,
the
knowledge
they
had.
on
any
other
assumption,
petitioner's
case
would
go
up
in
smoke
because
he
has
assumed
and
we
have
gone
along
with
him
that
the
agents
could
give
the
grand
jury
no
more
than
they
knew,
and
he
says
that
what
they
knew
was
hearsay.
and
what
we
say
is,
you
have
to
assume
by
the
same
token
that
they
didn't
give
the
grand
jury
less
than
they
knew,
because
the
alternative
would
be,
that
even
if
all
144
witnesses
at
this
trial
had
said,
“yes,
we
were
before
the
grand
jury.”
if
you
didn't
assume
that
they
told
the
grand
jury
what
they
knew,
then
it
would
be
meaningful.
and
in
every
case,
by
the
mere
assertion
on
information
and
belief,
the
mere
assertion
of
innocence
and
the
mere
suggestion
that
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
was
insufficient,
you'd
had
to
open
up
the
grand
jury
minutes,
a
step
which
this
court
has
--
as
recently
as
united
states
against
johnson
in
319
u.s.
rejected,
a
step
which
would
mean
that
every
case
would
be
not
only
a
trial
before
the
petit
jury
but
a
retrial
of
a
kind
of
nisi
prius
determination
by
a
grand
jury
that
the
defendant
would
be
brought
to
trial.
whatever
the
precedents
are
in
a
very
few
states,
particularly
new
york,
which
mr.
fraenkel
has
mentioned,
it
has
been
clear
throughout
our
history
and
throughout
the
history
of
england
from
which
we
adopted
our
grand
jury
that
no
such
procedure
is
permissible.
now,
as
i
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
now,
this
information
that
i
have
summarized,
the
assets,
the
liabilities,
the
expenditures
of
the
costellos,
was
the
information
that
these
agents
had
collected.
now,
i
might
say
only
in
passing
and
not
to
destroy
in
full
the
question
before
the
court
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
us
that
all
these
questions,
even
within
the
--
all
these
testimonies,
even
within
the
technical
rules
of
evidence
was
hearsay.
at
least,
when
the
agents
testified
that
we
did
this
and
we
investigated
that
and
we
came
up
with
these
negative
findings,
there
was
no
objection
by
petitioner's
counsel
on
the
ground
that
this
testimony
was
incompetent.
and
further,
as
i've
said,
it
was
testimony
that
was
important.
this
negative
testimony,
negating
other
assets,
negating
cash
at
this
turning
point,
it
was
testimony
which
was
important
for
the
net
worth
expenditures
demonstration,
the
government
was
making
at
the
trial.
now,
even
assuming
that
this
evidence
was
technically
within
a
part
of
that
huge
hearsay
rule,
we
say
that
there
was
no
practical,
reasonable,
common
sense
basis
for
holding
that
the
grand
jury
could
not
indict
on
this
ground.
now,
the
only
real
practical
objection
or
the
only
real
difficulty
that
might
have
arisen
in
connection
with
this
evidence
in
its
posture
before
the
grand
jury
could've
been,
first,
were
the
agents
stupid
or
careless
when
they
copied
the
figures
from
macy's
and
b.
altman's
and
so
forth.
or
second,
were
the
agents
lying?
now,
these
are
questions
with
any
kind
of
evidence
that
a
grand
jury
is
always
required
to
ask
itself,
and
always
permitted
to
answer
for
itself
with
finality.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
--was
such
cross-examination
at
the
trial,
your
honor,
yes.
leath
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
it
tends
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh,
no,
no.
no.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
attempts
to
upset
for
the
most
part,
to
upset
the
theory
on
which
these
computations
were
involved.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
no,
there
was
none.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
were
one
or
two
items
of
expenditure
about
which
when
the
witness
was
on
the
stand.
there
were
some
questions
about
the
propriety
of
introducing
it
or
the
adequacy
of
the
proof
of
it.
but
for
the
most
part,
these
expenditures,
this
--
this
heart
of
the
case
and
the
assets,
built
on
bank
records
and
brokerage
records
and
so
on,
are
fully
proved
at
the
trial.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor,
she
was
not.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
but
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that
a
rolls
royce
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
there
was
only
one
witness
for
the
defense.
and
that
witness
was,
indeed,
an
expert.
he
was
an
accountant
who
setup
his
summary
of
the
evidence,
and
his
assumptions
on
the
basis
of
which
it
would
be
shown
that
there
was
no
tax
evasion,
but
there
was
no
contradiction
of
any
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
now,
of
course,
the
whole
thrust
of
our
argument
and
we
think
fairly
read
although
there
is
some
broad
language
in
it,
the
effect
of
the
opinion
below
as
applied
to
these
facts,
is
that
to
ask
whether
the
question
--
whether
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
was
competent
or
incompetent
in
terms
of
the
trial
rules
of
evidence
is
the
wrong
question.
and
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
that
dealing
with
this
very
kind
of
treasury
agents'
testimony,
the
eighth
circuit,
on
two
older
decisions
of
which
the
petitioner
relies,
has
held
that
this
evidence,
this
kind
of
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
was
competent.
and
therefore,
that
an
indictment
based
on
it
cannot
be
set
aside.
now,
we
would
think
it
makes
little
difference
whether
your
determination
is
based
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
is
competent,
perhaps
competent
in
some
sense
referring
to
the
functions
of
the
grand
jury
or
on
the
ground
that
the
mere
hearsay
label,
because
some
particular
evidence
would
technically
be
hearsay
at
the
trial,
is
not
sufficient
to
nullify
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
at
least,
where
the
evidence
is
rationally,
reasonably
probative
of
the
facts.
it's
there
rational
reasonable
basis
on
which
layman,
the
lay
tribunal
which
is
the
grand
jury,
could
reasonably
decide
that
one
of
their
fellow
citizens
should
be
accused
and
be
brought
to
trial.
now,
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
this
same
evidence
came
before
the
petit
jury
in
the
form
of
a
parade
of
witnesses.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
the
people
who
could
testify
that
these
are
macy's
records
and
they
showed
$200
spent
by
the
costellos
in
such
year,
in
such
year,
in
such
year.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
have
thought
that
within
the
technical
rules
of
evidence,
because
these
come
within
a
shot
full
of
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule.
it
was
necessary
and
proper
to
bring
these
people
in
with
their
documents
to
testify
before
the
petit
jury.
we
have
thought
that
if
a
defendant
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
think
that
there
is
certainly
a
more
liberal
rule
before
the
grand
jury.
and
that,
as
such,
in
their
standard
wigmore
form,
the
trial
rules
of
evidence
do
not
apply
to
the
grand
jury.
now
that
is
not
to
say,
it
is
by
no
means
to
say
and
learned
--
judge
learned
hand
carefully
excluded
this
case
that
the
grand
jury
may
act
on
mere
rumors,
suspicion,
or
evidence
which
is
not
rationally
probative
of
what
they're
supposed
to
be
finding
out.
that
is
merely
to
say
that
the
trial
rules
of
evidence,
which
is
what
they
are,
which
contemplate
the
whole
adversary
paraphernalia
of
the
trial
court
with
objections
and
rulings
by
a
trial
judge,
that
these
have
no
--
had
application
to
the
grand
jury.
that
merely
defines
that
the
grand
jury
acted
wholly
or
partly
on
evidence
which
would
have
been
excluded
on
objection
if
there
were
any
place
of
objection
in
the
grand
jury,
is
no
basis
for
holding
than
an
indictment
is
invalid.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
was
no
dispute
over
the
partly,
indeed
the
rule
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
there
were
an
objection.
and
i
--
i
add
that
because
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it's
familiar
law
that
if
there
was
not
an
objection
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
such
evidence
which
is
probative.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
i
have
mentioned
that
in
a
footnote,
because
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
ask
for
a
dismissal
in
a
way
that's
improvidently
granted,
but
it
is
a
fact
that
i
think
should
be
before
the
court.
it
is
also
a
fact
that
as
i
understood
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
mr.
fraenkel,
engaged
in
some
discussion,
as
to
whether
the
mass
of
this
affirmative
evidence
was
hearsay.
and
we
think
that
the
mysteries
reflected
in
that
discussion,
the
technicalities
involved
in
the
application
of
the
hearsay
rule
have
no
place
in
judging
the
nature
of
the
substantial
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
an
indictment
of
the
grand
jury
before
you
may
be
brought
to
trial.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
think
certainly
no,
and
of
course,
while
i
--
i'm
not
going
into
it
and
--
and
do
not
propose
to
discuss
it
at
length.
as
far
as
1789
is
concerned,
we
have
reviewed
the
precedence
in
our
brief
at
some
length.
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
there
that
a
question
like
this,
a
proposal
to
review
the
grand
jury's
determination,
whether
they
were
sufficient
or
sufficiently
competent
evidence
to
indictment,
was
never
countenance
in
the
english
law
adopted
in
our
constitution.
now,
we
recognize
full
well
that
in
the
realm
of
personal
liberties
and
in
the
realm
of
the
bill
of
rights,
there
is
development.
and
we
conceive
that
if
there
were
some
substantial
interest
at
stake
here,
we
could
develop
beyond
the
english
rule
embodied
in
the
fifth
amendment.
but
what
we
say
in
the
upshot
is
that
there
is
no
such
sanctity
in
the
hearsay
rule
with
all
its
ramifications
that
it
should
be
written
into
the
constitution.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
of
course
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
of
course,
there
is
in
fact
a
distinction,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
no
one
has
a
right
if
he
is
a
potential
defendant
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
or
even
to
know
that
the
grand
jury
is
considering
a
possible
indictment
against
him.
the
ordinary
situation
is
that
the
grand
jury,
unless
the
prosecution
or
its
own
curiosity
leads
it
further,
hears
the
evidence
for
prosecution.
this
is
an
ex
parte
inquiry
where
there
are
no
objections
and
where
there
is
no
confrontation,
and
where
there
is
no
cross-examination
itself,
perhaps,
the
most
important
probably,
the
most
important
basis
for
the
hearsay
rule.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
this
court
has
said
in
the
hurtado
case
and
our
opponents
acknowledged
in
their
brief,
that
although
it
is
a
rare
thing
and
we
do
not
rely
heavily
upon
it,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
historic
power
of
the
grand
jury
to
act
on
its
own
knowledge
has
ever
been
taken
away.
and
i
think
it's
assumed
on
both
sides
that
the
grand
jury
has
such
power.
and
of
course
if
you
pursue
that
far
enough,
you
will
find
that
this
own
knowledge
which
a
grand
jury
can
act
on
like
much
of
the
knowledge
that
all
of
us
carry
with
us
traces
to
hearsay
of
one
kind
or
another.
but
here,
where
we
have
a
very
concrete
case,
and
where
we
have
all
the
indicia
of
care
and
fairness,
we
--
although
we
do
it
in
our
brief,
had
not
thought
that
our
oral
presentation
should
follow
all
these
possible
ramifications.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh
no,
your
honor,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
we
--
we
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
went
away
down
that
path
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
or
--
or
what
we
would
do
about
that
path
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
if
we
were
worried
about
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
but
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
thought
i
was
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
being
led,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
concur,
your
honor,
and
whoever
led
me,
i've
returned
from
any
--
any
suggestion
i
might
have
made
that
the
arguments
we
present
here
go
in
any
way
to
modify
the
rules
of
evidence
and
the
rights
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination
at
a
trial
before
the
petit
jury.
i
was
interested
primarily
and
we
have
been
throughout,
precisely
in
distinguishing
the
mode
of
proceeding
at
a
trial
and
the
requirements
for
determination
of
guilt
from
the
mode
of
proceeding
before
the
grand
jury
where
there
was
no
cross-examination
of
anybody.
no
confrontation
by
the
prospective
defendant.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
the
--
we
have
assumed
for
purposes
of
this
case
as
the
court
below
assumed,
that
in
its
posture
before
the
grand
jury,
the
knowledge
which
the
agents
presented
through
the
grand
jury
is
within
the
hearsay
rule
for
the
most
part
at
least.
i
indicated
those
exceptions
for
that
negative
investigation
which
we
think
is
important
and
to
which
the
agents
did
testify
at
the
trial
without
objection.
and
what
we
say
is,
that
merely
because
you
can
dub
this
evidence
hearsay
is
not
enough
in
point
of
precedent
or
in
point
of
this
substantial
guarantee
that
the
right
to
indictment
gives
is
not
enough
for
invalidating
an
indictment.
and
let's
illustrate
that,
if
we
may,
in
terms
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
by
no
means,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
burden
rests
extraordinarily
heavily
on
the
defendant
who
is
challenging
the
determination
of
the
grand
jury,
and
we
have
cited
in
the
vicinity
of
page
54
of
our
brief
cases
where
the
courts
go
forward
to
presume
that
evidence
which
could
have
been
before
the
grand
jury
or
was
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
i
want
to
say
parenthetically
in
regard
to
that,
mr.
fraenkel
has
cited
us
for
not
asserting
that
there
was
other
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
i'll
be
frank
with
the
courts
to
say
that
i
do
not
know.
it
did
not
seem
to
me
appropriate
since
the
minutes
have
not
been
disclosed,
and
since,
two
courts
have
felt
that
the
minutes
should
not
be
disclosed,
to
attempt
to
make
it
shown
that
this
late
day
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
was
additional
material
before
the
grand
jury.
we
have
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
that
the
showing
our
opponents
have
made
is
a
demonstration
that
these
three
agents
were
all
that
were
before
the
grand
jury.
we
have
said
that
the
courts
below,
particularly
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
have
assumed
that
through
our
argument,
but
we
have
made
the
footnote
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
put
to
your
--
to
the
court
the
suggestion
that
in
the
other
cases
where
there
has
been
an
opportunity
for
an
assumption,
the
presumption
has
been
the
other
way.
the
presumption
has
been
in
favor
of
the
grand
jury
and
in
favor
of
the
propriety
of
its
action.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
think
it
follows,
your
honor,
that
you
must
make
that
assumption.
the
--
let's
trace
it.
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
the
defendant
claimed
he
was
innocent.
therefore,
the
grand
jury
could
not
have
had
any
competent
evidence.
therefore,
he
should
be
allowed
to
see
the
minutes.
now
mr.
fraenkel
has
acknowledged
quite
correctly,
i
think,
that
the
denial
of
that
motion
for
inspection
of
the
minutes
was
certainly
proper,
because
if
that
kind
of
motion
could
prevail,
everybody
would
always
inspect
the
minutes.
then,
he
went
through
the
trial
and
he
claimed,
as
he
claimed
in
his
brief,
that
by
his
showing,
that
only
these
three
agents
of
all
those
at
the
trial
had
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
he
had
established
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment.
he
did
not
again
seek
--
seek
inspection
of
the
minutes
at
that
point.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
motion
had
been
denied
before
trial
by
judge
weinfeld.
the
case
was
tried
by
judge
mcgohey
and
there
is
no
reassertion
before
judge
mcgohey
of
a
claim
or
demand
for
inspection
of
the
minutes.
the
assertion
simply
is
that
he
had
made
his
showing
and
on
the
basis
of
that
showing,
the
indictment
should
be
set
aside.
and
it's
on
that
basis
that
it
went
through
the
court
below
and
came
here.
we've
also
noted
in
our
brief
that
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
haven't
finished
my
answer
to
your
real
question,
your
honor.
he
had
exhausted
every
effort
and
as
things
stood,
he
could
not
find
out
anymore
about
what
had
transpired
before
the
grand
jury.
but
we
think
it
does
not
follow
that
we
must
therefore
assume
that
the
case
is,
as
he
states
it,
these
three
and
no
others
appeared
before
the
grand
jury.
the
fact
is
that
what
went
on
before
the
grand
jury
is
almost
never
known
to
the
defendant.
this
is
a
perfectly
fortuitous
occurrence.
several
times,
defendants
have
made
incipient
efforts
to
retry
before
the
petit
jury
the
finding
of
the
grand
jury,
and
if
asked
questions
like
this,
“did
you
appear
before
the
grand
jury?”
and
the
questions
have
been
objected
to
by
the
government,
and
the
objections
have
been
sustained
and
we
think
properly,
because
that
issue
is
not
a
relevant
issue
at
the
trial,
and
need
not
be
explored
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
you
--
you
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
you
can
indict
people
and
--
and
that
the
government
faithfully
does
without
the
defendant
knowing
who
were
the
witnesses
against
him.
he
knows
who
the
grand
jury
was.
and
if
that
grand
jury
under
oath
has
determined
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
bring
him
to
trial.
but,
it
is
not
by
any
means
uniform
custom
that
the
names
of
the
witnesses
are
endorsed
on
the
indictment
or
that
the
defendant
has
any
other
way
of
knowing
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
when
he
does
know.
now
--
now,
i
understand
that
the
custom
in
the
southern
district
where
this
case
comes
from
is
not
to
endorse
the
names.
and
here,
these
questions
for
reasons
that
i
do
not
know
although
they
were
first
objected
to
and
the
objection
sustained
were
then
permitted,
but
we
leave
with
the
court
the
question,
whether
this
showing
is
sufficient
even
to
assume
that
this
was
all
the
grand
jury
had
and
we
suggest
that
the
presumption
is
to
the
contrary.
but
like
the
court
below
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
i
would,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
that
inspection
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
ought
to
be
permitted
on
this
kind
of
issue.
if
--
if
my
answer
were
otherwise,
i
think
i
would
be
driven
to
the
point
of
saying
that
the
kind
of
motion
this
defendant
made
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
should
also
be
granted.
because
here
--
here
is
a
perfect
accident
of
procedure
that
makes
it
possible
for
him
to
know
whereas
other
defendants
don't
know,
that
of
the
witnesses
at
the
trial,
only
these
three
were
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
if
that
--
the
kind
of
accidental
foundation
is
to
be
a
basis
for
exploration
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
revision
of
the
grand
jury's
determination,
we
don't
think
it
should
rest
simply
there
but
that
you
would
be
led
to
opening
up
these
minutes
and
making
this
kind
of
revision,
much
more
broadly.
as
in
the
states
which
entertain
this
kind
of
complaint
against
the
indictment
with
it.
those
states
usually
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
direction
of
the
decisions
of
--
of
the
one
decision
of
this
court
that
i
will
mention
and
rely
on
strongly,
and
of
some
dicta
is
that
way,
that
the
determination
of
probable
cause
by
a
grand
jury
is
conclusive.
the
court
has
used
that
language,
but
we
don't
go
nearly
that
far
in
this
case.
and
judge
learned
hand
did
not
go
nearly
that
far.
he
said,
that
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
grand
jury
had
no
evidence
before
it,
which
rationally
tended
to
prove
the
fact,
then
he
would
be,
he
and
his
brethren
would
be
the
first
to
hold
that
such
an
indictment
was
invalid.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
say
that,
we
--
we
are
prepared
to
stand
on
that
ground
your
honor.
the
fact
that
i
suggest
the
alternative
basis
of
decision,
i
hope
doesn't
mean
abandoning
any
one
of
them
even
though
they
might
not
all
be
perfectly
consistent.
but
our
main
argument
here
is
that
by
that
test
and
on
this
showing,
and
on
the
assumption
that
these
three
agents
were
the
only
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury,
costello's
complaint
fails.
that
here,
the
agents
have
shown,
that
they
had
knowledge
before
the
grand
jury,
voluminous
detail,
rationally
probative
knowledge
on
which
the
grand
jury
could
reasonably
determine
that
costello
should
be
brought
to
trial.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
grand
jury?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
i
say
that
because
these
agents
have
shown
that
they
had
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
adduced
at
the
trial.
now,
the
united
states
attorney
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
had
a
record
of
the
facts.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
that
--
that
is
correct
and
that's
where
the
hearsay
come
--
comes
in.
they
knew
what
macy's
book
showed.
they
knew
what
b.
altman's
book
showed.
they
knew
what
the
surrogate
courts'
record
showed
and
the
real
estate
records
and
the
bank
records
and
so
on.
and
they
went
to
the
grand
jury
and
they
said,
“these
records
show
this
and
we've
copied
out
this
number.
and
this
means
this
and
we
claim
that
costello
has
evaded
his
taxes.”
now,
what
could
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
--
i
was
simply
going
to
say
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
it's
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i'm
--
i
--
unless
it
gets
me
into
too
much
trouble,
i
would
be
happy
to
accept
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
that
suggestion
but
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
but
what
i'm
saying
really
is
that,
however
you
put
it,
however
you
put
it,
this
grand
jury
had
rationally
probative
evidence
that
was
sufficient
for
reasonable
men,
reasonably
to
decide
that
costello
should
be
brought
to
trial.
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
we
think
--
we
think
that
that
is
certainly
all
you
need.
now,
the
grand
jury
which
if
our
research
is
correct,
is
itself
an
extremely
independent
historically
and
extremely
independent
and
largely
self
ruled
tribunal,
the
grand
jury
could
have
said
this
doesn't
convince
us.
we
want
to
see
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
macy.
we
want
to
see
their
books
and
not
perhaps
the
photostats
that
you've
brought
or
whatever
the
agents
had
with
them.
and
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
u.s.
attorney
would
have
gone
ahead
and
parade
it,
10
or
20
or
50
or
all
hundred
on
of
these
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
until
it
became
convinced.
but
what
we
say
about
this
lay
tribunal
is
that
it's
impossible
on
the
basis
of
this
showing
to
hold
that
it
behave
unfairly,
unreasonably,
oppressively
in
being
convinced
on
this
showing
that
there
was
probable
cause.
now,
the
united
states
attorney
on
his
own
motion
could
have
paraded
10
or
20
or
more
of
these
witnesses
with
their
little
pieces
of
documentary
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
and
then
we
would
have
within
petitioner's
proposed
rule,
some
competent
evidence.
the
enlightenment
of
the
grand
jury
would
not
have
been
enhanced,
because
no
dozen
or
two
dozens
of
these
witnesses
were
enough
in
themselves
to
make
out
this
case.
you
needed,
maybe
a
hundred
of
them
or
more
in
toto
to
build
up
this
case.
no
one
of
them
or
any
of
them
had
facts
which
were
in
themselves
incriminating.
now,
let
me
even
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
have
said
that
--
that
some
of
the
testimony
of
the
agents
at
the
trial
which
we
assumed
they
had
for
the
grand
jury
does
not
seem
to
us
to
be
hearsay.
but
i
have
argued
further
in
defense
of
the
court
below,
that
that
label,
that
rubric,
that
term
from
a
new
relevant
context,
the
context
of
an
adversary
trial,
that
term
hearsay
is
not
a
mechanical
answer
to
the
substantial
question
that
might
arise
under
the
fifth
amendment
if
there
were
any
real
showing
that
a
grand
jury
had
behaved
unfairly,
unreasonably,
in
a
way
that,
the
kind
of
lay
tribunal
of
grand
jury
is,
should
not
act
if
there
was
to
be
any
substantial
guarantee
in
the
right
to
an
indictment.
or
i
will
even
say
that
you
have
wholly
different
problem.
if
you
have
a
murder
case,
or
some
other
crime,
where
an
investigator
goes
before
the
grand
jury
and
says,
“there
were
two
eye
witnesses
to
this
murder,
and
they
told
me
that
the
accused
committed
the
murder.”
now
there,
i
think
you'd
have
hearsay
of
an
entirely
different
order.
there
would
be
no
justification
for
that
kind
of
shortcut.
a
proper
grand
jury
should
be
suspicious
of
that
kind
of
evidence.
a
well
behaved
prosecutor
would
probably
not
want
to
take
a
shortcut
of
that
kind.
there,
although
we
certainly
don't
reach
it
here,
you
might
well
reach
the
situation
referred
to
in
the
opinion
below
of
an
absence
of
rationally
probative
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
a
situation
where
again
in
judge
hand's
words,
the
grand
jury
had
advocated,
but
you
have
--
you
have
no
such
situation
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
no.
that's
--
i
just
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
now,
all
the
rest
is
hearsay
in
the
sense
that
the
foundation
witnesses
who
carried
the
books
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
and
the
papers
and
so
on
at
the
trial
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
were
not
there.
and
i
say
that
that,
for
purposes
of
this
substantial
right,
is
--
is
an
innocuous
matter.
and
that
--
only
an
arid
insistence
on
hearsay
and
the
--
and
the
sacrosanct
character
of
wigmore
and
the
hearsay
rule
would
insist,
would
demand
a
transfer
from
the
trial
situation
where
this
rule
have
some
relevance,
although
it
is
even
being
questioned
there.
we
don't
question
it
here.
would
insist
on
a
transfer
of
the
rule
from
that
context
to
the
context
of
a
wholly
different
situation
in
the
grand
jury
room
where
all
the
paraphernalia
for
administering
these
exclusionary
rules
is
absent.
and
the
basic
justification
for
the
hearsay
rule,
the
right
to
cross-examination
does
not
exist.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
you
mean
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
there
are
--
there
are
documents,
your
honor,
in
this
record
admitted
in
accordance
with
the
criminal
and
civil
rules
with
no
--
with
no
witness
at
all
to
bring
them
in.
i
mean
there
are
--
there
are
tax
returns,
records
of
oil
leases,
deeds
and
matters
like
that
which
are
admitted
at
the
trial
without
objection,
with
no
certifying
or
authenticating
witness
and
which,
i
suggest
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
this
in
a
footnote,
you
could
well
presume
were
before
the
grand
jury
as
well.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
want
to
mention
two
other
precedents.
one
of
this
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no.
i
want
to
refer
to
a
case
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
want
to
refer
your
honor
to
--
however,
i
may
have
described
it
to
holt
against
the
united
states,
which
is
in
218
u.s.
245
is
described
at
pages
31
and
32
of
our
brief.
it
is
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
now
in
that
case
and
i'm
--
i
might
state
at
the
outset
the
exact
lines
of
my
purpose
in
invoking
this
case.
this
case,
as
we
view
it
now,
after
reflecting
on
it,
goes
much
further
in
upholding
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
than
does
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
the
decision
we
seek
here.
briefly,
the
case
involved
this.
there
was
a
showing
that
the
grand
jury
had
before
it
incompetent
evidence
in
the
form
of
confessions
unlawfully
coerced
and
procured
by
unlawful
inducements.
there
were
threats
and
inducements
which
resulted
in
those
confessions.
and
it
was
shown
and
the
court
decided
on
this
basis
that
there
were
these
confessions
before
the
grand
jury
and
“very
little
other
evidence.”
the
nature
of
which
was
not
specified.
now,
there,
rejecting
a
claim
that
the
indictment
should
have
been
set
aside,
mr.
justice
holmes
stated
briefly,
first,
that
this
was
a
matter
largely
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
and
second
and
more
important,
that
if
objections
of
this
kind
were
to
be
entertained,
the
abuses
of
criminal
procedure
would
be
enhanced.
now,
let
me
spell
out
which
is
all
necessary,
the
significance
of
that
case.
there
you
had
before
the
grand
jury
incompetent
evidence
of
the
most
damaging
kind,
not
merely
incompetent
because
some
dry
rule
of
evidence
made
it
so,
but
because
a
very
fundamental
constitutional
policy
made
it
so,
evidence
of
the
most
damaging
kind,
evidence
taken
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
and
evidence
in
its
nature
inherently
untrustworthy
and
no
other
evidence.
it's
interesting
to
note
for
very
little
other
evidence
the
nature
of
which
is
not
shown.
i've
looked
at
the
record
in
that
case
and
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
evidence
of
these
confessions
was
attempted
to
be
introduced
at
the
trial
and
was
excluded
unlike
the
testimony
of
the
agents
in
this
case.
now,
we
think
it
would
be
unrealistic
in
the
extreme
to
doubt
that
the
grand
jury
in
the
holt
case
acted
wholly
or
entirely
on
the
basis
of
those
unlawful
confessions.
now,
we
have
said,
and
i
think
we've
lead
ourselves
be
drawn
into
a
hypertechnical
trap
that
the
case
is
not
squarely
implied
because
there
was
some
other
evidence
alleged
to
have
been
before
the
grand
jury.
we
think
now
that
the
case
is
not
only
incoherent
but
it
makes
this
case
a
fortiori,
because
it
illustrates
the
artificiality
and
the
impropriety
of
transplanting
the
rules
of
evidence
from
the
trial
jury
to
the
grand
jury.
now,
in
the
holt
case,
if
you
have
a
petit
jury
at
jury
trial,
and
an
effort
to
introduce
those
confessions
as
you
did,
and
they
had
been
introduced
before
the
petit
jury,
over
objection,
the
conviction
would
be
reversed
for
the
very
good
and
substantial
reason
that
in
any
sensible
administration
of
this
trial
rules,
because,
you
cannot
know
what
improper
evidence
the
grand
jury
may
have
a
light
--
the
petit
jury
may
have
a
light
on.
you
have
to
reverse
if
evidence
more
than
trivial
was
wrongfully
admitted.
but
here,
everybody
concedes
and
the
holt
case
flatly
hold
that
if
there
is
some
competent
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
the
fact
that
there
are
loads
of
incompetent
evidence
makes
no
difference.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
opinion
does
not
show.
but
the
briefs
in
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
record
show
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
that
there
were
threats
made
to
the
defendant.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
wholly
unlike
the
evidence
here
which
came
in
or
which
was
admissible,
which
violated
no
rights
of
the
defendant
which
was
lawfully,
fairly,
carefully
obtained.
and
i'd
like
to
mention
one
other
case
for
another
point,
and
that
is
the
second
circuit's
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
the
--
this
was
an
army
captain
going
before
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
that
indictment
was
upheld.
now,
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
if
i
could
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
learned
hand
who
wrote
for
the
court
below
in
this
case,
the
dissenting
opinion
in
united
states
against
remington
in
208
f.2d
567.
now
there,
the
ultimate
issue
was
one
with
which
we're
not
concern
but
the
majority
assumed
and
judge
learned
hand
stated
at
length
to
his
conclusion
that
an
indictment
that
was
involved
in
that
case
was
invalid.
and
judge
hand
based
his
conclusion
on
two
things.
first,
that
a
grand
jury
had
treated
a
witness
oppressively,
and
second,
and
this
was
his
clinching
reason,
that
the
grand
jury
had
overwritten
a
marital
privilege
in
accepting
the
testimony
of
this
same
witness.
now
there,
if
you
examine
the
opinion,
you
see
an
application
of
a
rule
of
evidence
and
other
considerations,
not
mechanically,
not
simply
laying
against
the
evidence
the
rules
in
wigmore,
but
sensibly,
reasonably,
and
a
determination
that
a
grand
jury
had
not
acted
reasonably
and
fairly,
and
that
its
action
should
be
set
aside.
now,
that
is
a
clear
indication
of
an
important
point
that
neither
judge
hand
nor
his
brothers
on
the
court
below
have
suggested
that
an
indictment
under
any
circumstances
with
any
kind
of
incompetent
and
unfair
and
unprobative
evidence
is
always
inviolable.
that's
by
no
means
what
they
suggest
for
what
they
hold
is
that,
merely
to
say
that
the
grand
jury
didn't
know
it's
wigmore
and
didn't
obey
a
technical
rule
of
evidence
is
not
enough
to
set
aside
its
action.
and
we
say,
that
costello
has
been
justly
indicted,
fairly
tried,
and
properly
convicted,
and
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
a
petit
jury
and
in
a
verdict
approved
by
two
courts.
and
we
say
that
in
these
circumstances,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
to
send
the
case
back
now,
for
a
grand
jury
to
determine
whether
there
is
probably
cause
to
indict
would
enforce
no
substantial
right
and
would
in
the
--
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
johnson
case,
go
far
to
make
the
grand
jury
upon
in
a
technical
game
or
rather
than
respecting
it
as
the
great
historic
tribunal
of
lay
inquiry
into
criminal
wrong
doing.
