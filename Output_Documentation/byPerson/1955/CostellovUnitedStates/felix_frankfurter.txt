do
we
know
--
do
we
know
here
--
are
there
any
means
of
knowing
what
the
hearsay
was
which
is
before
the
grand
jury
as
the
basis
of
the
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
have
here
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
seeing
that
it's
cogitated,
what
did
--
how
did
he
know
what
he
knows?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
any
requirement
of
federal
law
that
they
must
be
admitted
to
the
grand
jury
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
it's
constitutionally
required
that
there
should
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
those
minutes
of
grand
jury
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
things
that
aren't
prohibited
by
the
constitution
aren't
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
fraenkel,
i'd
like
for
myself,
and
that
is
written
just
as
this
problem.
that
was
in
my
connection
with
grand
juries
in
the
past,
in
federal
grand
jury.
i'm
greatly
aware
of
the
difference
between
a
conduct
of
federal
grand
jury
and
the
state
grand
jury.
i
would
like
to
know
exactly
what
question
is
before
us,
because
i
don't
want
to
decide
in
that
judgment
as
to
whether
an
indictment
should
be
based
on
hearsay
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
who
did
testify?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
those
three
--
did
those
three
agents,
i
would
ask
a
series
of
questions
in
order
to
really
focus
this
case
to
it's
proper
considerations
and
not
the
abstraction
which
brought
the
case
here
or
which
was
stated
by
judge
hand.
do
we
know
who
the
three
witnesses
were
and
were
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
went
also
before
the
petit
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
what
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
three
people
--
what
the
three
people
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury
testified
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
what
they
testified
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
only
testified
about
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
telling
us
what
they
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
--
cover
it
with
page
--
exhibit
--
what
page
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
exhibits
summarizing
and
apparently
before
we
had
--
of
transactions
which
the
defendant
had
with
other
people,
and
perhaps
there's
been
others,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
data
were
taken
--
and
these
data
were
put
down
on
this
schedule
of
exhibits
by
people
who
did
that
who
did
not
have
first
hand
on
his
knowledge
of
what
he
bought
or
what
he
bought
that
one
would
tell
us
and
so
on,
and
if
the
underlying
data,
out
of
which
this
exhibit
was
made
up,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
exhibits
are
largely
subtractions
from
in
compilation,
made
out
of
these
records.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
three
witnesses,
who
did
appear
then
were
the
only
people
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
testified
to
--
testified
what
is
called
hearsay
at
the
trial
and
which
was
competent
at
the
trial,
because
the
underlying
data
were
authenticated,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
they
were
put
in
these
exhibits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
but
the
--
but
these
three
witnesses
were
witnesses
at
the
trial
who
put
in
these
exhibits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
these
three
witnesses
testified
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
in
these
exhibits,
in
these
trials,
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
exhibits
are
hearsay,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
witness
who
testify
to
them
could
only
testify
that
he
carefully
and
accurately
abstracted
what
the
other
witnesses
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
call
that
hearsay
at
the
trial
and
gives
it
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
summarizations
are,
in
any
technical
sense,
hearsay,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
call
them
opinions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
--
it
was
admitted
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
all
i
know,
these
exhibits
and
these
summaries,
without
the
presence
of
the
underlying
data
to
(inaudible)
the
witnesses
of
making,
(inaudible)
and
so
on,
that
was
the
testimony
these
three
people
gave
at
the
grand
jury,
am
i
--
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
data
on
this
piece
of
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
similar
data.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
speak
from
personal
knowledge
that
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
done
in
the
morse
trial
and
others
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
that
treasury
agents
or
agents
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
have
abstracted
--
extracted
and
abstracted
data
from
brokerage
accounts
and
so
on.
brokerage
accounts
running
to
the
hundreds
and
they
put
that
exhibit
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
basis
for
grand
jury
action,
and
that's
what
was
done
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
shouldn't
defend
a
case
on
that
basis
and
not
the
abstract
question
whether
hearsay
which
means
everything
and
nothing
in
the
law
is
made
as
a
basis
of
an
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
help
you,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fraenkel
by
suggesting
that
your
short
answer
is
judge
hand's
statements
in
his
opinion.
the
defendant
did
all
he
could
to
bring
them
--
the
questions
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
as
much
as
the
--
he
says,
mr.
fraenkel,
but
in
my
time,
certainly
only
selected
cases
was
stenographically
before
the
--
that
there
was
a
stenographer
during
the
--
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
remember
it
only
in
rare
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
won't
deny
that
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
one
reason,
it's
not
the
main
reason
why
that
has
been
the
rule,
certainly
that
was
(inaudible)
in
courts
throughout
the
country
for
not
giving
inspection
of
grand
jury
minutes,
go
up
the
street
on
--
in
the
state
supreme
court
that
--
those
motions
were
granted
all
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
us
where
in
the
indictment
it
was
found
and
when
this
trial
was
held?
isn't
that
mostly
at
this
point
as
though
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
exception
on
the
--
postponed
to
answer,
they
didn't
take
it
up
in
this
setting,
did
the
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
show
when
they
begun
their
inquiry,
their
study
of
these
brokerage
and
merchants
have
found?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
record
is
explicit
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
hearing
--
hearing
before
the
grand
jury
took
place
in
february
or
march
of
1953,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
these
agents,
at
least
one
agent
had
been
on
this
particular
investigation
nine
months
--
for
nine
months
since
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
may
i
interrupt,
mr.
frankel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
the
indictment
is
handed
down
on
march
14th.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
or
rather,
that
you
can
take
judicial
notice,
to
know
how
--
how
many
days
this
grand
jury
had
been
in
session
before
this
indictment
was
on
the
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
cross-examination
of
these
three
agents
at
the
trial,
or
is
the
cross-examination
subject
the
accuracy
of
their
tabulation,
the
cross-examination
and
the
proof
of
the
finances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
--
on
what
order?
what
kind
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
say
it
isn't
copies
to
make
what
the
macy
account
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
--
i
mean,
merely
the
--
the
pertinency
of
the
raw
figures,
there
were
x
number
of
brokerage
accounts
that
this
defendant
had,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
would
--
(inaudible)
where
they
can
accomplish
the
--
either
short,
either
long
on
this
--
of
these
securities
and
to
be
--
be
this
proper
to
accept
that.
was
there
any
attack
on
the
accuracy
of
their
--
the
--
of
the
obstructions
made
in
these
tabulations
from
the
original
books
of
the
broker
of
which
the
tabulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
mrs.--
mrs.
costello
a
witness
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
was
not
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
anybody
a
witness
to
say
that
a
rolls
royce
--
i'm
giving
a
hypothetical
case,
supposedly
bought
in
1951
was
in
fact
not
bought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
some
--
some
piece
of
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
refer
as
a
--
was
it
pertinent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
court
--
this
court
long
ago,
way
back,
40
years
ago
it
did
held
that
such
a
summary
by
incompetent
persons
of
complicated
mass
of
raw
data,
thinking
as
competent
evidence.
and
by
this
time
it
has
established
itself
(inaudible)
nobody
has
challenged
it
anymore.
and
that's
what
the
essence
of
these
figures
were,
weren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
of
any
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
if
you
discuss
technical
hearsay,
this
--
this
whole
question
in
the
area
of
the
(inaudible)
to
what
extent
would
the
bookkeeping
argument
either
immediately
or
accumulatively
or
(inaudible)
that
the
law
has
changed
enormously
but
has
allowed
without
bringing
in
the
fellow
who
made
the
first
initial
inquiry,
but
on
this
(inaudible)
is
a
big
shock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
50
years
ago,
you
have
to
bring
down
the
last
boy
in
the
court,
to
hold
up
the
whole
--
is
all
that.
i
should
think,
critically
the
federal
court
would
go
along
but
now
you
can
bring
in
a
complicated
accounting
without
reason
in
every
blessed
person
who
checks
or
received
the
cash
or
put
it
into
a
(inaudible)
to
get
a
cash
here,
so
that,
what
is
hearsay,
the
point
of
view
of
certain
constitutional
law
isn't
something
which
is
fixed,
1789
or
maybe
1889
or
1900
and
that's
--
but
that's
not
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
accompany
myself
down
the
path
that
indicate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
grand
jury,
the
basis
of
an
indictment,
and
the
basis
of
a
conviction,
i
can't
imagine
a
more
--
a
more
patent
wide,
drawn,
indeed
different,
and
what
had
graduate
in
that
town
and
what
can
secure
a
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
drawn
to
another
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
just
going
to
say
that,
but
of
course
it's
your
duty
not
merely
with
adequacy
to
cut
the
case
down
to
limit
its
size
as
you
mention.
you
take
your
broader
position
in
this
present
case.
and
i
--
i
do
not
think
you
should
have
said
to
the
suggestion
that
it
isn't
for
the
grand
jury
to
have
reasonable
grounds
for
finding
guilt.
that
isn't
its
job.
its
job
is
to
have
reasonable
grounds
for
making
a
charge
which
is
a
very
different
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
was
there
in
this
record
any
evidence
to
the
point
that
the
underlying
data
of
the
agent
summary
in
the
exhibit
represented
a
cost
of
living
which
gave
customers
in
it
through
the
record?
that
would
be
--
that's
for
your
amusement
if
you
look
at
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
(inaudible)
case
in
227,
that
was
a
case
where
a
landlord
(inaudible)
where
books
were
entered
or
admitted
in
a
criminal
case
which
sends
a
very
esteemed
man
to
jail.
they
were
admitted
because
although
the
entrance
were
uncalled,
the
books
had
been
represented
across
the
business,
and
therefore
required
the
kind
of
reliability
and
trustworthiness
that
required
even
the
facts
that
that's
what
people
acted
upon.
now
then,
you
like
that
to
be
brokerage
--
breakage
accounts
into
that
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
arguing
that
this
case
requires
a
good
deal
of
fighting
into
the
very
questions
of
whether
such
books
without
the
original
person
who
did
the
pencil
or
ink
in
them
upon
which
this
sum
was
drawn
did
have
to
be
present
on
any
--
on
what
you
called
the
arid
hearsay
rule.
and
that
become
established
until
this
court
(inaudible)
212
in
the
record,
so
that
is
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
--
what
were
the
circumstances
that
made
the
confession
incompetent
in
the
holt
case,
mr.
frankel?
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
look
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
that
the
--
that
the
exigency
that
while
as
a
matter
of
what
we
call
sometimes
truthfully
but
in
such
a
way
for
excluding
extorted
confession
points
to
the
same
notion
as
our
criminal
proceedings.
what
made
it
incompetent
or
the
circumstances
that
it
would
--
the
evidence
couldn't
be
admitted
as
you
indicated
and
if
it
had
been,
it
would
have
reversed
the
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
agree
that
--
you
will
have
agreed
that
evidences
to
a
confession
amongst
the
most
powerful
types
of
evidence
will
get
this
for
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
--
including
a
charge
of
witchcraft,
did
they
even
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
their
own
knowledge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they're
responsible
not
artistic.
those
are
very
different
concepts.
and
judge
hand,
you
--
you
mean
the
word
irresponsible
and
maybe
not
artistic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
didn't
mean
it
when
he
first
said
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
mind
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
can't
go
to
his
mind
but
he
has
the
way
of
using
words
that
precedes.
when
he
said
irresponsible,
he
meant
that
that
is
for
the
grand
jury.
it's
a
very
different
thing
(inaudible)
and
from
the
cabinet
officer
whose
under
particularly
by
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you're
not
saying
their
reputation
was
fair
enough
or
the
inspection
of
grand
jury
minutes
were
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
that
is
in
the
--
that
problem,
it
doesn't
exclude
the
alternative
from
the
situation
or
you're
not
entitled
to
the
minute
and
you're
never
entitled
to
raise
the
question
if
you
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
ways
in
which
other
litigants
can
raise
a
question
which
has
a
very
–
very
limited
scope.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
that
but
there
is
the
policy
which
this
court
has
recognized
against
giving
minutes
and
i
hope
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
information
will
never
arise
that
we
would
have
in
the
federal
courts
the
situation
in
new
york
state

we
have
indicated
that
clearly,
radically
that
disclosure
of
grand
jury
minutes
is
not
part
of
the
federal
criminal
practice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
by
the
state
rule
often
by
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
new
york
criminal
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
the
new
york
state
court
has
something
that
everybody
has
a
good
care
about
criminal
justice
would
recognize.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
unnecessary
modes
of
leaving
that
because
you've
got
all
the
--
all
the
knowledge
you
have
and
to
establish
to
your
point,
you
have
a
party
mr.
shilensky?
justice
felix

when
it
comes
to
deprivation
of
citizenship
or
denaturalization,
this
court
has
said,
the
man
might
have
acquired
their
citizenship
as
illegal
as
possible
but
unless
the
government
of
the
united
states
comes
up
to
a
certain
status
and
approved,
they
don't
think
about
their
case.
now,
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury
is
such
that
to
undermine
its
rules
puts
upon
an
accuse
the
verdict
which
he'd
be
governed
to
the
state
if
he
doesn't
sustain
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
whole
case
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
justice
holmes
is
very
careful
to
say
if
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
being
a
careful
judge,
he
limited
the
decision
to
what
was
enforced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
gathered
himself
by
the
hypothesis
--
hypothesis
of
the
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
hope
your
answer
was
the
answer
which
make
it
an
adverse
judgment
on
the
government
that
it
is
careful
on
its
own
accountancy
that
it
doesn't
charge
anybody
with
tax
evasion
when
it
might
have
a
good
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
were
these
common
result?
what
were
they
shown
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
charts
--
chart
don't
summarize
all
the
opinions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
kind
of
all
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
was
the
item,
the
total
item
of
the
barber.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
barber
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
they
brokers
figures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
--
and
what
was
the
amount
of
evasion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
$300,000
of
the
amount
that
were
involved,
how
much
depended
upon
the
barber
and
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
is
--
what
in
amount
figures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
then
would
say
that
the
–
that
the
items
that
related
to
the
brokers
account
and
recognizes
like
(inaudible)
well,
date
that
they
had
before
they
came
to
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
way
back
and
able
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
they
had
it
when
they
want
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
knows
that
you
were
done
with
the
case
until
they
go
to
the
court.
and
i'd
have
to
dislodge
myself
as
my
theory
not
to
know
that
pleadings
like
that
is
(inaudible)
for
months
before
they
go
to
the
grand
jury.
