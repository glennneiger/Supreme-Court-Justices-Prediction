justice
stanley
reed
why
--
why
did
you
say
he
didn't
have
access
to
them?
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
and
he
made
that
application?
justice
stanley
reed
it
was
denied.
he
made
it
before
the
trial.
justice
stanley
reed
before
trial?
justice
stanley
reed
but
i
--
i
believe
you
said
mr.
fraenkel
that
the
record
didn't
show,
who
decides
these
three
were
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
stanley
reed
and
you
have
no
way
--
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
and
you
have
no
way
to
find
it
out.
you
did
everything
you
could.
justice
stanley
reed
does
the
record
show
how
the
information
was
gathered?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
--
this
same
evidence
which
came
before
the
petit
jury?
justice
stanley
reed
you
mean
the
sales,
the
keepers
of
the
account
in
macy's
for
instance.
justice
stanley
reed
and
the
department
thinks
that's
necessary
to
bring
special
witnesses
from
macy's
to
testify
rather
than
the
account
in
support
of
it?
justice
stanley
reed
no
dispute
over
the
partly,
i
take
it.
justice
stanley
reed
that
part,
it
may
rely
partly
on
the
evidence
which
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
so,
what
we
have
is
whether
exclusively
evidence
which
would
--
that
one
before
the
grand
jury
would
not
be
admitted
before
the
trial
court?
justice
stanley
reed
because
there
were
no
objections,
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
intended
to
add
objection.
justice
stanley
reed
i
would
--
you
assume
that
only
these
three
were
there.
justice
stanley
reed
well
we
--
we
must
assume
that,
must
we,
mr.
frankel,
since
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
defendant
made
every
effort
to
get
the
record
to
the
grand
jury
and
be
able
to
prove
precisely
who
was
there?
justice
stanley
reed
oh,
i
--
i
understood
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
judge
--
judge
hand
said
that
he'd
exhausted
every
effort.
what
did
he
do?
justice
stanley
reed
were
those
his
words?
justice
stanley
reed
perhaps,
in
one
way
he
doesn't
know
it
--
what
he
does
know,
is
it?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
let's
assume
that
he
repeated
his
motion
after
the
witnesses
had
testified,
would
you
make
that
same
statement
of
the
--
of
not
to
assume
they
were
the
only
people?
justice
stanley
reed
or
--
or
in
saying
that
any
reasonable
belief
of
the
grand
jury
that
a
man's
reasonable
suspicion
of
guilt
is
enough
to
indict
one.
justice
stanley
reed
a
grand
--
a
grand
jury
indicts.
and
if
from
one
--
your
court
or
another,
they
get
information
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
that
they
think
is
reasonable
to
accept,
that
make
an
indictment,
give
an
indictment.
justice
stanley
reed
they
have
knowledge
of
the
record
to
the
facts.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
they
had
knowledge
of
the
record.
justice
stanley
reed
oh,
because
these
three
men
had
gone
out
checking
accounts.
justice
stanley
reed
now,
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
that's
--
these
people
that
have
been
charged
on
the
books
by
the
people
who
brought
it.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
all
you
need.
justice
stanley
reed
before
--
before
you
go
on,
you
were
--
you
were
going
to
refer
to
a
case
from
this
court
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
what
it
held
in
regard
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
evidence
that
it
was
sufficient
that
the
grand
jury
had
reasonable
evidence
before
it?
justice
stanley
reed
i
thought
you've
mentioned
such
a
case.
justice
stanley
reed
well
--
before
you
leave
the
holt
case
was
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
that
a
case
of
a
written
confession
that
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
a
witness
merely
testified
that
the
man
had
confessed
to
it?
justice
stanley
reed
well
i
--
i'm
not
in
the
--
the
impression
that
you
say
you
don't
allege
error
because
the
grand
jury
minutes
were
refused.
justice
stanley
reed
but
you
do
--
then
do
you
allege
error
because
no
proper
evidence
was
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
stanley
reed
and
how
--
how
do
you
prove
that
no
proper
evidence
have
done.
justice
stanley
reed
you
mean
of
what
witnesses.
justice
stanley
reed
how
--
how
do
you
know
all
the
witnesses
were
before
the
court.
justice
stanley
reed
where
they
should?
justice
stanley
reed
but
--
but
there
was
other
evidence
--
justice
stanley
reed
no
--
no.
justice
stanley
reed
but
on
--
on
that
first
witness.
justice
stanley
reed
but
--
but
before
you
read
--
justice
stanley
reed
he
was
testifying
as
to
the
result
from
an
income
tax
standpoint
that
would
arise
if
other
evidence
which
is
produced
by
witnesses
who
can
testify
in
regard
to
the
purchasing
were
correct.
justice
stanley
reed
i
know,
but
there
was
other
evidence
of
that.
