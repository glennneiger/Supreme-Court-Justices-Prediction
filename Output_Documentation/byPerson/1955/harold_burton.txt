justice
burton
well,
that
--
that
means
without
the
saying
that
the
state
can
use
in
that
(inaudible)
justice
burton
it
was
a
mere
fact
that
it
later
is,
it
turns
out
to
be
false
is
sufficient
to
justify
a
new
trial
i
suppose?
justice
burton
well
--
well,
of
course,
at
the
trial,
he
had
the
same
opportunity
to
show
that
he's
perjured
than
he
would
now.
justice
burton
do
you
have
the
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
in
florida?
justice
burton
does
it
have
to
be
brought
within
a
certain
time,
is
there
a
time
limitation
on
this?
justice
burton
did
he
appeal
from
that?
justice
burton
did
the
state
(inaudible)
justice
burton
have
these
other
habeas
corpus
been
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
justice
burton
(inaudible)
i'm
thinking
it
was
res
judicata
but
i
was
thinking
whether
the
supreme
court
of
florida
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
that
has
been
filed.
justice
burton
well,
actually,
what
is
before
the
at
the
time
they
entered
the
order
with
your
signing
up,
they
had
a
full
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
a
previous
habeas
corpus
has
been
filed.
justice
burton
is
there
anything
--
is
there
anything
in
this
case
to
show
that
these
cattle
were
all
taken
at
the
identical
time
and
place?
justice
burton
it
says
they
were
taken
on
the
29th
of
july
or
the
7th
of
july
or
whatever
it
is
but
further
than
that
it
doesn't
go,
does
it?
justice
burton
the
record
of
his
conviction
isn't
here
that
--
justice
burton
where
is
that?
justice
burton
do
you
see
as
this
counsel
had
showed
they
were
on
the
same
day?
justice
burton
you
mean
you
didn't
--
justice
burton
yes,
that
--
that
he
claimed
--
justice
burton
--
should
be
possible.
would
we
--
would
we
be
required
to
presume
that
if
a
--
justice
burton
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
and
certainly
the
indictment
doesn't
or
the
information
doesn't
allege
it.
justice
burton
well,
he
might
have
thought
that
there
were
three
crimes
--
justice
burton
--
(voice
overlap)
the
same
time.
justice
burton
but
did
the
--
justice
burton
well,
let
me
do
have
collateral
effects
by
habeas
corpus?
justice
burton
let
us
not
face
the
record
here.
this
man
alleges
matters
berfore
the
record.
justice
burton
and
he
alleges
in
his
petition
to
matters
that
he
holds
the
record.
justice
burton
--
tax
collaterally
with
him
with
--
by
habeas
corpus.
justice
burton
you
just
admitted
that
you
--
you
can
collect
--
justice
burton
(voice
overlap)
habeas
corpus.
justice
burton
and
he
certainly
could
have
done
it
by
coram
nobis,
couldn't
he?
justice
burton
assuming
he
knows
the
record
(voice
overlap).
justice
burton
what
can
you
show
under
--
under
coram
nobis
in
florida?
justice
burton
well
that
certainly
wasn't
a
form
--
create
--
a
face
of
the
record?
justice
burton
that
certainly
wasn't
on
the
face
of
the
record.
justice
burton
no,
it
never
does.
justice
burton
of
course
not.
justice
burton
well
you
can't
--
so
you
can't
attack.
justice
burton
do
you
think
any
court
would
clarify
its
judgment
upon
the
record
if
its
judgment
of
guilt
where
it
chose
to
read
the
--
the
conviction
is
based
upon
perjured
testimony?
justice
burton
well,
i
don't
see
any
--
justice
burton
have
it
(inaudible)
