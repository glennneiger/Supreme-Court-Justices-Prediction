justice
black
well
--
justice
black
--
perhaps
you
can't
have
a
second
habeas
corpus
in
florida
unless
you
have
explained
why
on
your
--
you
didn't
raise
the
question
in
the
first.
justice
black
or
could
have
been
adjudicated.
justice
black
can
i
--
can
i
ask
you
about
the
washington
v.which
i'm
reading,
(inaudible)
for
us
because
of
what
has
the
record
said.
that
it
seems
to
bear
out
what
he
said
that
they
first
declared
this
rule.
and
then
said
that
he
wasn't
trying
to
affect
the
petition
through
the
first
count
on
the
ground
that
he
failed
to
state
the
date
on
which
the
various
defenses
were
committed.
justice
black
and
that's
--
that's
what
precisely
what
he
had
tried
to
do
in
the
first
day
in
this
court.
justice
black
and
then
they
stated
the
rule
that
they
wouldn't
let
him
know.
and
then
they
went
ahead
and
analyzed
the
indictment
in
the
former
cases.
he
said
that
the
indictment
was
good.
justice
black
but
he
was
out
of
court
and
that
is
the
rule
which
we
--
we
must
assume
they
have
and
which
we
must
assume
they
act
on.
but
how
can
we
do
that
if
--
if
they
don't
act
on
it?
if
they
haven't
acted
on
it,
in
the
very
cases
where
they
declared
than
if
they
just
did.
it
sounds
more
like
an
admonition,
doesn't
it?
justice
black
have
you
any
cases
where
they
get
the
--
the
problem
or
the
right
to
raise
their
question
of
that
kind,
constitutional
question?
justice
black
do
you
mean
that
--
do
you
mean
that
if
it's
hard
to
admit
it
that
he
was
bearing
six
sentences
or
six
different
offenses
that
barred
and
wouldn't
supply
any
remedy
for
such
a
situation.
if
that
--
if
that's
why
he
admitted
the
fact
--
justice
black
well
the
jury's
verdict
indicates
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
black
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
record.
justice
black
it
was
something
part
of
the
coram
--
justice
black
may
i
ask
you,
you
said
something
awhile
ago
that
i
didn't
quite
understand.
did
this
man
have
a
lawyer
in
his
original
trial?
justice
black
may
i
ask
you
this
and
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
thing.
if
his
allegations
are
true,
what
sentence
do
you
think
was
the
maximum
the
judge
could
have
given
him?
justice
black
and
he
has?
justice
black
he
now
has
16
more
years
to
serve?
justice
black
how
much
more?
justice
black
often
he
would
get
-
he
would
get
off
for
good
behavior
if
he
had
just
had
ten
years
presumably?
justice
black
well
the
issue
you
have
here
then
is
that
a
man
who,
under
florida
law,
that
his
allegation
got
through
and
which
you
have
not
denied
could
not
have
been
sentenced
for
more
than
10
years,
he's
now
serving
apart
of
the
30-year
sentence
and
your
issue
that
you
attend
to
us
here
that
he
has
no
right
to
relieve
because
of
the
fact
that
no
appeal
was
taken
and
that
the
question
was
not
raised
in
that
way.
justice
black
and
that
irrespective,
and
assuming
that
he's
serving
a
30-year
sentence,
when
under
florida
law,
nobody
could
legally
be
given
more
than
10
that
he
has
no
remedy.
justice
black
as
it
is,
well
i
--
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
relevant
to
ask
you
what
i
was
about
to
ask
(inaudible)
it's
a
rather
strange
situation
to
me.
justice
black
now,
i
understand
it
further
that
the
--
if
his
allegations
are
true,
or
that
--
that
the
attorney
general's
office
is
evident,
it
has
not
even
made
inquiries
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
his
allegations
are
true,
which
if
true,
would
show
that
he
was
serving
30
years
sentence
where
the
law
could
not
legally
give
him
the
10.
