mr.
william
h.
webb
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
refer
to
petitioners
as
cold
metal
and
the
respondent
as
united.
this
case
like
the
one
which
has
just
been
argued
to
your
honors
involves
the
proper
construction
of
amended
rule
54
(b),
the
applicability
of
the
rule
to
this
case
and
the
validity
of
the
rule
if
it
is
given
the
broad
or
affirmative
construction
which
has
been
accorded
to
the
rule
by
several
courts
of
appeals
including
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
bendix
case
and
also
in
this
case.
more
specifically,
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
a
judgment
entered
on
cold
metal's
claim
is
a
final
judgment
because
it
contains
the
talismanic
language
of
amended
rule
54
(b),
even
though
there
remains
completely
unadjudicated,
a
counterclaim
filed
by
united
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence
as
cold
metal's
claim
and
which
seeks
a
recoupement
or
set
off
against
the
very
judgment
from
which
united
appealed.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
on
cold
metal's
motion
to
dismiss
united's
appeal,
held
the
judgment
final
and
appealable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
contains
the
findings
or
certificate
specified
in
amended
rule
54
(b)
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
judgment
does
not
adjudicate
even
a
whole
claim
and
certainly
does
not
adjudicate
the
counterclaim
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction.
i
think
the
factual
background
of
this
case
points
up
even
more
strongly
than
the
sears
case,
devices
inherent
in
this
so-called
affirmative
construction
of
amended
rule
54
(b)
as
enunciated
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
bendix
case
and
in
this
case
and
by
a
panel
of
the
court
in
the
second
circuit
and
also
by
the
first
circuit.
it
points
up
the
fact
that
that
construction,
that
affirmative
construction
actually
invests
the
district
court
with
power
to
fix
and
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
appeal
and
this
court
in
contravention
of
section
1291
of
28
u.s.c.
and
in
contravention
of
this
court's
prior
determinations
of
what
constitutes
a
final
judgment
under
1291.
the
court's
construction
and
application
of
the
rule
in
the
case
at
bar
will
inevitably
lead,
of
course,
to
a
further
appeal
on
the
same
transactions
or
occurrences
as
those
involved
in
the
present
appeal.
i
shall
state
the
facts
rather
completely
so
that
your
honors
will
fully
appreciate
the
nature
of
this
rather
lengthy
controversy.
i
think
we've
almost
done
in
mr.
(inaudible)
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
--
the
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
i
shall
try
to
do
that,
your
honor.
in
my
view,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
has
held
in
the
bendix
case
and
in
this
case
that
if
the
district
court
will
insert
in
its
order
the
talismanic
language
of
rule
54
--
amended
rule
54
(b)
then
that
judgment
becomes
a
final
and
appealable
judgment
and
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
court
of
appeals
whether
that
this
judgment
comes
within
the
proper
scope
of
section
1291
as
construed
and
applied
by
this
court
in
earlier
years.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
--
that
that
is
exactly
what
would
happen.
i
think
that's
the
--
the
view
as
expressed
by
the
court
in
the
bendix
case.
i
think
i
would
like,
before
going
to
the
facts,
to
state
to
your
honors
what
i
believe
to
be
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
questions
or
a
few
of
them
that
he
asked
during
the
preceding
argument.
i
think
the
question
came
up
as
to
the
effects
of
amended
rule
54
(b).
i'd
like
to
take
first
the
effects
of
amended
rule
54
(b)
when
given
the
negative
--
so-called
negative
construction.
and
to
that,
if
you
have
a
determination
made
by
the
district
court
as
specified
in
the
rule
and
that
is
carried
into
the
judgment,
then
everyone
knows
that
the
district
court
is
perfectly
willing
to
relinquish
the
--
that
phase
of
the
case,
that
it's
through
with
that
particular
claim
and
the
parties
know
then
that
an
appeal
should
be
taken
if
the
judgment
complies
with
section
1291
and
is
a
final
judgment.
now,
if
the
determination
specified
in
the
rule
is
not
made
then
this
means
that
the
district
court
is
--
wants
to
hang
on
to
that
particular
phase
of
the
case
and
everybody
knows
that
the
judgment
is
not
final
and
that
no
appeal
can
be
taken.
now,
let's
go
for
just
a
moment
to
the
affirmative
construction
of
the
rule.
i
think
that
it
brings
about
the
following
results.
first,
it
alters
the
statutory
concept
of
appealability
through
the
promulgation
of
rules
of
district
court
procedure.
second,
it
enlarges
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
of
this
court,
extending
appellate
jurisdiction
to
judgments
which
were
not
previously
appealable.
mr.
william
h.
webb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
h.
webb
congress
could
do
that,
your
honor,
but
congress
has
not
done
so.
mr.
william
h.
webb
i
don't
think
so,
may
i
say
that
there
are
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
section
1291,
of
course,
was
reenacted
in
the
law
after
amended
rule
54
(b)
was
promulgated.
in
the
second
place,
the
situation
under
the
law
as
it
stands
now
is
this.
congress
has
given
this
court
power
to
fix
rules
of
procedure
in
the
district
court.
it
has
delegated
authority
to
this
court
in
that
regard.
now,
under
this
so-called
affirmative
construction,
this
court
in
turn
has
delegated
that
power
to
the
district
courts
because
the
district
courts
acting
within
their
discretion
have
the
power
to
determine
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
final
judgment
and
it's
purely
discretionary.
i
don't
believe
that
there's
anything
in
the
historical
background
of
these
rules
with
--
or
of
the
statutes
which
would
even
indicate
that
either
congress
or
this
court
have
the
slightest
intent
of
placing,
on
a
purely
discretionary
basis
in
the
hands
of
the
district
court,
a
complete
determination
of
this
matter
of
--
of
appealability,
the
appealable
jurisdiction.
and
then
another
thing,
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that
this
court
in
response
to
the
statutory
command
of
congress
would
have
the
power
to
set
forth
in
a
rule,
to
define
by
a
rule
what
is
a
final
judgment.
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
what
has
been
done
in
amended
rule
54
(b).
there
is
no
definition
in
amended
rule
54
(b)
at
all
of
what
constitutes
a
final
judgment
that
is
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
no.
but
that
has
been
construed
by
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
webb
if
congress
says
that
it
shall
be
final
for
purposes
of
appeal
if
this
--
if
a
certain
stamp
is
placed
on
it
then
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
--
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
--
it
would
appealable.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
i
think
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
well,
i
think
that
it's
probably
could
be
done
but
i
don't
think
it
has
been
done.
now,
to
go
on
with
my
statement
of
the
effects
of
the
affirmative
construction,
as
i've
already
indicated,
i
think
that
the
affirmative
construction
reallocates
judicial
power
between
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
and
between
the
district
court
and
this
court.
there's
a
complete
inversion,
i
believe,
of
judicial
process
as
judge
learned
hand
stated
it
in
the
flegenheimer
case.
next,
it
enables
the
trial
court
in
its
discretion
from
day
to
day
and
from
case
to
case
to
determine
appealability
disregarding
in
the
process
the
command
of
section
1291
and
this
court's
decisions
construing
the
statute.
next
it
abridges,
i
believe,
and
modifies
substantive
rights
of
litigants
contrary
to
the
express
command
of
the
enabling
act
under
which
the
rules
were
promulgated.
next,
i
think
it
will
create
complete
lack
of
uniformity
in
the
courts
and
even
within
the
same
court
in
regard
to
appellate
jurisdiction.
next,
it
provides
a
purely
mechanical
way
of
determining
finality
and
i
assume
but
that
might
be
a
very
healthy
way
of
determining
finality,
it
would
remove
a
lot
of
this
controversy
that
has
gone
on
for
a
good
many
years
but
a
mechanical
way
of
determining
finality
necessarily
disregards
substance.
mr.
william
h.
webb
well,
i
think
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor,
if
thus
disregards
substance
i
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
it
will
destroy
a
substance
because
you
can't
work
out
a
mechanical
way
of
accomplishing
a
thing
of
this
character
which
will
do
justice
under
all
circumstances.
mr.
william
h.
webb
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
well,
i
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
well,
if
it's
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
if
it's
a
purely
mechanical
rule,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
see
how
the
court
of
appeals
even
acting
under
the
ulrich
statute
could
correct
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
william
h.
webb
theoretically,
but
it
takes
a
little
finagling
to
find
out
at
times
just
exactly
what
the
final
decision
is.
mr.
william
h.
webb
first,
that
of
course
is
remedied
by
the
negative
view
of
the
floor.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
worry
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
--
about
a
repetition
of
the
--
the
dickerson
case.
next,
i
think
your
honor
it
permits
the
district
court
to
send
cases
to
the
court
of
appeals
merely
for
the
purpose
of
simplifying
litigation
what
this
court
has
said
that
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
provide
for.
next,
it
permits
the
district
court
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
i
think,
your
honor,
if
the
rule
is
given
the
so-called
affirmative
construction,
yes,
it
is
very
a
great
substantive
change.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes
--
yes,
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
can
invade
--
i
believe
that
the
district
courts
could
send
up
to
the
courts
of
appeals
cases
from
time
to
time
merely
for
the
purpose
of
simplifying
litigation
and
for
the
purpose
of
getting
guidance
to
help
them
in
connection
with
the
disposition
of
other
phase
--
other
phases
of
the
case
and
of
course
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
that
cannot
be
done.
mr.
william
h.
webb
well,
i
think
that
under
the
enabling
act,
this
court
was
given
a
complete
authority
to
promulgate
appropriate
rules
of
procedure
in
the
district
courts,
at
the
district
court
level.
and
i
believe
that
the
court
has
that
complete
power
as
it
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
--
has
declared
in
the
sibbach
case
and
in
other
cases.
but
nevertheless,
i
do
believe
that
there
are
appropriate
restrictions
on
that
power
specified
in
the
enabling
act
itself.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
webb
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
factual
situation
involved
in
the
sibbach
case,
your
honor,
to
adequately
answer
your
question.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
webb
no.
mr.
william
h.
webb
firmly,
has
the
power
to
do
so,
your
honor.
but
i
say
it
hasn't
done
so
in
this
instance.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
mr.
william
h.
webb
i
think
that
is
correct
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
that's
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
action.
another
result
of
this
affirmative
construction,
if
i
may
go
on
with
my
enumeration
of
them
is
that
it
means
that
this
court
has
approved
or
declared
by
rule
judicial
modification
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
a
power
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
does
not
have.
and
next,
it
compels
these
conclusions
which
i
stated
earlier,
i
believe,
that
congress
has
delegated
to
this
court
the
authority
to
determine
finality
and
appealability
and
that
this
court
has
delegated
to
the
district
courts
on
a
purely
discretionary
basis
the
power
to
determine
finality
and
appealabilty.
i
don't
find
as
i
have
stated
earlier
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
enabling
act
nor
do
i
find
in
the
history
of
the
rules
any
suggestion
on
the
part
of
anyone
that
congress
intended
to
delegate
to
this
court
the
power
to
determine
appellate
jurisdiction
nor
do
i
find
that
the
--
that
there
was
any
intention
anywhere
to
delegate
on
a
purely
discretionary
basis.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor.
going
now
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
november
1934,
cold
metal
filed
its
complaint
seeking
inter
alia
specific
performance
of
a
contract
that
have
been
entered
into
in
1927
between
it
and
united
and
under
which
united
was
to
acquire
certain
rights
under
a
patent
which
it
later
acted
and
which
became
patent
195.
united
sought
dismissal
of
that
action
in
its
answer.
in
january
1935,
there
was
a
hearing
on
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
to
restrain
united
from
the
performance
of
certain
acts
which
we
believe
were
improper
in
view
of
the
contractual
relationships
existing
between
the
parties.
the
injunction
was
denied.
that
was
reversed
however
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
went
back
then
to
the
district
court
and
in
view
of
the
holdings
of
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
case
was
there
the
first
time
cold
metal
filed
a
supplemental
complaint
in
which
it
sought
alternatively
rescission
of
the
contract
for
specific
performance.
the
case
came
on
for
final
hearing
before
the
district
court
in
october
of
1937.
and
in
january
1938,
the
district
court
rendered
an
opinion
denying
rescission
of
the
contract
and
granting
specific
performance.
in
june
of
1939,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court
as
to
no
rescission
and
affirmed
the
granting
of
specific
performance.
then
in
june
1941,
after
the
mandate
had
gone
down,
united
moved
for
a
leave
to
file
what
it
called
a
second
supplemental
answer
and
counterclaim.
and
in
that
pleading
where
they
filed
at
that
time,
it
sought
substantially
the
same
relief
as
it
now
seeks
in
its
pending
counterclaim.
in
february
1942,
that
motion
was
denied
in
an
opinion
which
is
the
court
of
the
43
f.
supp.
then
the
decree
on
mandate
was
not
entered
immediately
but
it
was
entered
in
september
of
1943.
and
that
decree
provided
that
cold
metal
was
entitled
to
recover
royalties
from
united
under
this
contract
and
that
decree
appointed
a
master
to
determine
the
amount
that
was
due
under
the
contract
and
the
rate
at
which
the
royalty
payments
were
to
be
made.
there
was
an
accounting
held
before
the
master
and
in
that
accounting,
one
of
the
contentions
which
was
made
by
united
was
that
there
was
a
failure
of
consideration.
and
united,
in
support
of
its
defensive
failure
of
consideration,
asserted
substantially
the
same
things
as
it
has
asserted
in
this
counterclaim
which
i
am
going
to
come
to.
mr.
william
h.
webb
no.
the
court
--
the
case
has
been
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
three
different
occasions.
in
79
f.2d,
i
believe,
it
was
the
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
and
then
in
107
f.2d
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
it
was
there
again
in
a
decision
reported
at
190
f.2d
and
then,
of
course,
it
got
there
on
this
recent
appeal.
so,
it's
four
times
instead
of
three,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
that
--
well
--
well,
they
could
have
taken
that
case
up
at
that
time
because
there
was
a
denial
of
an
injunction.
that's
right,
a
certain
injunctive
relief
had
been
asked
for
and
the
case
went
up
under
1292.
but
in
1949,
now
going
to
this
counterclaim,
in
1949,
while
this
case
was
before
the
master
while
the
accounting
was
going
on,
united
filed
in
the
district
court
what
it
called
an
?ancillary
cross
complaint?
that
civil
action
no.
7744.
that
cross
complaint
was
again
based
on
the
same
facts
as
those
asserted
by
united
in
the
accounting
proceeding
as
constituting
failure
of
consideration,
but
in
that
ancillary
cross
complaint,
united
was
seeking
first
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
cold
metal
from
prosecuting
certain
suits.
second,
it
was
asking
for
an
accounting
as
to
royalties
cold
metal
had
received
from
others.
third,
it
was
asking
that
the
royalties
they
set
off
against
any
award
that
might
be
made
to
cold
metal
in
this
case
which
is
equity
2991.
and
fourth,
they
were
asking
--
united
was
asking
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
fact
that
it
says
it
was
forced
to
participate
in
certain
of
the
patent
infringement
that
the
infringement
litigation
of
cold
metal
had
brought
against
others.
well,
on
august
28,
1950,
on
cold
metal's
motion
that
ancillary
cross
complaint
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
ancillary
to
equity
2991.
and
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
i
might
add,
unless
the
cross
complaint
could
have
been
considered
as
ancillary
to
this
case.
the
court
dismissed
it.
united
appealed
and
in
june
1951,
in
an
opinion
reported
at
190
f.2d
217,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
united's
pleading
was
in
reality,
a
counterclaim
in
this
action
and
it
remanded
the
case
for
further
considerations
by
the
district
court.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
held
that
this
pleading
was
a
counterclaim
that
it
grew
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence
as
cold
metal's
main
claim
and
that
it
would
have
been
a
compulsory
counterclaim
had
it
matured
when
united's
original
answer
was
filed.
but
nevertheless,
there
is
that
positive
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence
as
cold
metal's
main
claim.
but
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
district
court,
united
amended
its
pleading
in
october
1951.
and
after
getting
leave
of
court
to
file,
it
did
file
this
counterclaim.
now,
the
cold
metal
filed
its
reply
thereafter.
now,
in
that
still
pending
and
unadjudicated
counterclaim,
united
has
pleaded
the
same
facts
as
those
on
which
it
relied
before
the
master
in
support
of
its
defensive
failure
of
consideration.
and
in
the
counterclaim,
the
same
facts
are
relied
upon
as
a
basis
for
recoupment
or
set
off
against
the
amount
ultimately,
awarded
to
cold
metal
by
the
master
and
the
district
court
on
the
claim
asserted
in
the
complaint.
more
specifically,
in
this
counterclaim,
united
is
asking
for
injunctive
relief
against
some
suits
brought
by
cold
metal.
it
is
asking
for
an
accounting
as
to
this
royalties
alledgedly
collected
by
cold
metal
in
united's
field
of
license
and
it
is
asking
for
a
recovery
from
cold
metal
of
those
royalties
to
a
sufficient
extent
to
enable
it
to
have
recoupment
or
setoff
as
against
any
amount
that
cold
metal
has
been
awarded
in
this
case.
and
united
also
is
seeking
damages
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
if
has
had
to
participate
in
certain
patent
litigation
which
cold
metal
brought
against
others.
now,
united
did
not
even
seek
a
hearing
on
that
counterclaim
while
this
case
was
before
the
master
although
it
was
filed
at
that
time.
but
in
may
of
1954,
the
report
of
the
master
came
down
and
the
--
the
master
awarded
cold
metal
some
$300,000
in
royalties.
and
in
the
summer
of
1954,
while
the
parties
were
preparing
objections
to
the
master's
report,
this
counterclaim
was
about
to
come
on
for
trial
before
judge
miller
in
the
district
court
and
both
parties
went
to
judge
miller
and
said,
"well,
let's
hold
this
up
until
after
we
dispose
of
the
matter
of
the
objections
to
the
report
of
a
special
master
which
we
are
at
present
preparing.
for
those
that
the
judge
was
perfectly
to
postpone
the
trial
pending,
the
disposition
of
those
objections
by
the
district
court."
in
december
of
1954,
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
objections.
in
january
of
1955,
the
district
court
filed
an
opinion
and
entered
an
order
confirming
the
master's
report
and
directing
entry
of
judgement
for
cold
metal.
in
february
of
1955,
united
appealed.
cold
metal
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
a
final
appealable
order
in
view
of
the
dependency
of
this
unadjudicated
counterclaim
seeking
recoupment
and
also
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
judgment
did
not
contain
the
talismanic
language
of
rule
54
(b)
as
an
amended.
then
in
march
of
1955,
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
judgment
was
not
a
final
decision
and
dismissed
united's
appeal
without
prejudice
to
the
right
of
united
to
apply
to
the
district
court
for
a
new
order
if
the
district
court
offered
to
include
this
language
a
determination
required
under
rule
--
amended
rule
54
(b).
so,
on
march
30th
of
1955
on
united's
motion,
the
january
15,
1955
order
was
vacated
and
--
and
an
amended
order
was
added
and
that
amended
order
is
substantially
identical
with
the
original
order
of
january
19,
1955
except
that
it
does
include
the
express
determination
of
no
just
reason
for
delay
and
a
direct
entry
of
judgment
pursuant
to
amended
rule
54
(b).
and
on
march
31st,
enforcement
of
that
judgment
was
stayed.
we
attempted
to
prevail
upon
the
district
court
to
not
enter
the
--
an
amended
rule
54
(b)
order
because
we
felt
that
we
were
entitled
to
get
an
adjudication
of
this
counterclaim
that
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction
prior
to
having
to
again
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
you
will
find
in
the
record,
they
show
that
the
district
court
really
did
not
give
consideration
to
the
counterclaim
and
inserted
what
it
termed,
this
magic
sentence
or
rule
54
(b)
in
the
order
despite
the
tendency
of
the
counterclaim
seeking
recoupment
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
impressed
upon
him
after
the
time
that
the
proposed
amended
order
was
presented.
the
sole
reason
given
by
the
district
court
for
including
this
magic
sentence
in
the
order
was
that
it
originally
intended
to
enter
a
final
judgment
and
that
it
wanted
enlightenment
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
assist
it
in
determining
the
issues
raised
by
the
counterclaim.
that
appears
at
pages
69,
70
and
71
of
the
record,
your
honor.
even
though
the
district
court
did
use
that
talismanic
language
of
the
rule,
it
obviously
did
not
intend
to
relinquish
control
over
or
the
right
to
modify
that
judgement
for
it
expressly
said.
and
you'll
find
this
at
page
68
of
the
record,
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
then,
the
counterclaim
can
be
asserted
against
the
judgment.
united,
of
course,
appealed
from
the
district
court's
order
and
we
again
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
amended
order
and
judgment
did
not
constitute
a
final
decision
under
section
1291,
since
there
was
no
adjudication
of
united's
counterclaim.
and
in
april
of
1955,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
that
motion
and
filed
a
short
opinion
in
the
holding
that
a
determination
made
by
the
district
court
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
was
the
very
kind
of
thing
that
rule
54
(b)
was
written
to
provide
for.
well,
does
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
webb
they
appealed
and
we
appealed
from
certain
faces
of
it.
mr.
william
h.
webb
the
injury
to
us
was
this,
your
honor.
we
will
have
to
go
back
if
--
if
this
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
should
entertain
the
appeal
and
should
affirm
for
example
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
the
court,
we'd
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
we
would
have
to
have
another
trial
on
this
counterclaim
going
over
a
lot
of
the
same
facts
--
practically,
the
same
facts
that
we've
already
gone
over
before
the
master
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
h.
webb
if
we
tried
it
out
now?
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
mr.
william
h.
webb
that
is
correct.
we
would
have
two
trials
instead
of
one.
we
added
two
appeals
instead
of
one,
two
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals.
because
if
the
court
should
entertain
the
appeal,
then,
it
goes
back,
we
have
a
retrial
and
then
we
come
up
again
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes.
that
is
correct.
and
also,
the
judgment
that
we
have
here
wouldn't
necessarily
be
final
because
what
they're
asking
for,
your
honor,
is
recoupment.
recoupment,
of
course,
is
a
defensive
matter
and
in
reality
we
say
that
the
district
court
has
not
even
disposed
of
a
whole
claim
because
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
have
a
case
within
a
case.
this
is
one
case,
these
counterclaims
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
already
held
or
as
out
of
exactly
the
same
transaction
and
we
couldn't
collect
on
the
judgment
that
we
have
until
after
we
went
back
and
went
through
the
trial
on
the
counterclaim
and
came
to
--
and
went
through
a
further
appeal.
does
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
webb
well,
i
say
your
honors
that
measured
by
any
proper
standard,
the
judgment
in
issue
is
not
final
and
appealable.
if
we
--
it
would
not
have
been
final
and
appealable
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
rules
cited
cases
in
our
brief
which
fully
support
that
view.
it
would
not
have
been
appealable
under
original
rule
54
(b).
and
i
say
that
it
cannot
be
considered
as
appealable
here
under
amended
rule
54
(b)
if
proper
effect
is
given
to
section
1291.
because
it
is
not
a
final
decision
as
that
term
is
understood
in
the
law.
and
of
course,
finality
is
a
congressional
requirement
insofar
as
appealability
is
concern
except
in
those
few
instances
covered
by
section
1292.
there
is
--
mr.
william
h.
webb
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
webb
that
is
correct.
now,
referring
again
to
judge
minton's
question
this
morning,
if
i
may,
an
argument
has
been
made
by
professor
moore
in
his
status.
that
if
this
court,
by
judicial
decision,
can
define
finality
within
the
meaning
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes.
then,
it
has
the
power
by
rule,
which
has
the
force
of
statute
to
define
finality
for
a
limited
situation,
namely,
where
an
action
involves
multiple
claims.
well,
i
think
that
the
complete
answer
to
that
argument
is
that
this
clerk
has
not
define
finality
in
amended
rule
54
(b)
as
affirmatively
construed
but
has
delegated
to
the
district
court,
the
complete
power
to
define
on
a
purely
discretionary
basis,
the
requirements
of
finality
and
appealability.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
h.
webb
if
i
have
about
a
half
minute,
i
would
like
to
state
to
the
court
that
our
position
is
not
that
you
have
to
throw
out
amended
rule
54
(b).
our
position
is
that
amended
rule
54
(b)
should
be
given
the
negative
construction.
and
that
amended
rule
--
and
that
the
judgment
that
we're
dealing
with
here
cannot
be
considered
as
a
final
decision
if
that
rule
is
given
the
proper
construction
and
the
only
one
which
we
believe
it
can
be
validly
given.
mr.
william
h.
webb
this
judgment
that
we
have?
mr.
william
h.
webb
yes,
your
honor,
certainly
not
a
final
judgment.
mr.
william
h.
webb
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
webb
well,
i
haven't
added
it
up
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
but
we
ask
for
interest
going
a
long
ways
back
of
the
entry
of
the
original.
mr.
william
h.
webb
we
didn't
get
it.
no.
thank
you,
your
honors.
