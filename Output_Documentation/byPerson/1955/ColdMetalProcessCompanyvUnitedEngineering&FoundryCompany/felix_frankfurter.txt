you
state
(inaudible)
justice

may
i
ask
one
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
if
you
argued
the
matter
before
--
or
if
you
consider
that
when
you
say
that
although
the
talismanic
words,
to
use
your
phrase,
are
here
before
your
honors
and
suppose
to
show
that
this
order
of
judgment
is
to
be
processed,

not
have
been
appealable
under

that's

a

action.
justice

would
you
mind

would
you
mind
explaining
why

why
he
couldn't
go
further
with
the
counterclaim
until
he
has
a
right
on
the
claim

on
this
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
why
contradicted
claims
by
a
plaintiff
can't
be
disposed
off
by
a
trial
judge.
i
suppose
that's
from
every
judge.
but
you
say

suppose
the
old

the
old
stuff
that
we
all
brought
up

a
long

never
borrowed

it
hadn't

justice

with

--
justice

yes.
justice

that
in
part
--
the

doesn't
matter.
you
said
they
contemplated

it
was
a
ligation

it
could
be

court,
before
he
had
his
lecture.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
you
argue
with
this
about?
is
this
after
bendix?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
probably
like
you
having
had
a
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
--
if
it
--
the
argue
that
was
pending,
the
court's
--
the
government
in
fact
had
done
anything
to
present
in
doing
also
what
--
justice

there's
no
bendix
case
has
been
argued
before,
i
knew
it
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix

yes.
so
that
--
so
that
he
was
already
bound
by
a
decision
of
the
court
in
there.
justice
felix

may
i
trouble
you?
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
brown?
just
--
just
supposing,
make
a
wild
assumption
that
this
court
was
of

who
appeared
is
correct.
correct
the
lower
court,
the
court
of
appeals

a
reversal.
suppose
this
question
holds,
it
does
not

it
does
not
allow
to
review
under

more
or
less
relevant.
what
would

what
would
be

you
change
your
position

may,
suppose
you
distinguish

irregardless
of
rule

then
you're
in

aren't
you?
then
--
that's
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
(voice

--
justice

suppose
you
have
pushed
that
and

you
don't
get
to
leave
by
the
court
of
appeals.
what
would
have
happen
in
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
they
--
couldn't
they
--
they
could
try
that
conference
anyhow
and
somehow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
get
a
line
as
i
understand
it
and
must
be
the
correction.that's
still
a
live
claim,
isn't
it?
justice

and
would
you
affirm
here,
what
would
happen
to
that
counterclaim
if
you
proceed
on
it?
