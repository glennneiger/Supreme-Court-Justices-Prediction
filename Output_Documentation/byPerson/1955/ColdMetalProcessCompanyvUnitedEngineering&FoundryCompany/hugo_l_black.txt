justice
hugo
l.
black
why
in
history?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
talking
about
this.
you
said
that
it
was
suggested,
that
the
device
you
understand
to
weigh
so
you
just
ask
for
review,
appealable
or
not,
to
destroy
its
substance
if
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
congress
wouldn't
leave
it
to
the
court,
send
it
to
the
district
court
as
have
been
suggested.
that
if
it's
as
the
state
ignores,
whatever
that
means,
abuse
the
discretion
declining
to
enter
a
statement
instead
of
judging
it
final,
the
appellate
court
still
--
still
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
where
the
--
i
--
i'm
not
saying
which
is
right
or
which
is
wrong,
but
i
don't
see
where
that
you
draw
everything
for
this
kind
of
stuff.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
provide
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
--
or
the
district
court
to
give
some
kind
of
finality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
lawyers
would
know
that
their
case
was
either
appealable
or
not
appealable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
mechanical
now,
isn't
it,
it's
purely
mechanical,
it
just
have
to
be
final
in
that
ends
it.
that's
the
mechanical
rule
theoretically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

sometimes
your
crime
might
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
because
you
made
a
mistake
and
that's
the
authority
to
say
the
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
however
if
congress
refused
to
bring
about
a
change,
i'm
not
saying
here
but
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
giving
the
court
power
to
make
rules
certainly
with
congress
if
their
(inaudible)
has
given
the
power
(inaudible)
enacted
and
passed
1789
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
it
might
be
a
strong
argument
than
they
have
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
could
make
a
difference
about
the
year
it
was
passed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
the
first
time
the
case
was
just
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
face
on
the
merits
of
the
controversy
before
the
accounting
was
held?
they
did,
your
honor.
they
passed
on
the
merits
of
the
controversy
granting
specific
performance
to
cold
metal.
namely,
they
ordered
that
cold
metal
under
the
agreement
was
entitled
to
recover
royalties
from
united
under
this
contract
which
had
been
entered
into.
and
then
as
i
say
the
case
went
back
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
it
--
how
did
they
get
that
up?
was
that
a
final
judgement
within
1291?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
and
it's
just
with
this
time
with
a
practical
matter.
what
interest
it
would
be
to
use
to
prevail
the
court
of
appeals
in
having
their
appeal
in
the
court?
as
i
understand
it,
they
haven't
--
you
have
a
judge
against
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
appealed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
district
court
said
that
it
would
rather
have
that
judgment
acted
on
before
it
--
it
might
dispose
the
whole
thing
rather
have
enacted
on
before
the
so-called
counterclaim
or
whatever
it
is
to
catch
on.
now,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
legal
point
but
i'm
just
curious
from
the
practical
standpoint
as
to
the
injury
used
if
the
court
did
proceed
to
determine
that
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
to
do
that
if
you
tried
it
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
tried
it
now.
would
you
have
to
go
over
the
same
facts
or
is
it
your
idea
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
went
back,
they
would
require
you
to
travel
over
the
same
field
and
offer
the
--
all
of
your
evidence
would
have
to
be
introduced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
in
effect
you
have
two
trials
instead
of
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
on
the
facts
on
the
validity
of
your
claim
against
them.
but
would
not
have
passed
on
the
validity
of
their
claim
against
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
--
your
idea
is
just
as
practical
of
slitting
up
one
cause
of
action
providing
an
unduly
cause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
the
--
in
answer
to
my
question
mean
would
explain
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter
in
the
beginning.
and
here,
according
to
you,
you
have
a
case
where
under
1291
could
not
possibly
be
taken
up
because
it's
splitting
up
at
two
courses
that
acted
as
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
you
have
after
the
face
in
front
the
question,
the
situation
squarely
as
to
whether
the
rule
54
(b)
as
effective
from
--
in
anyway
from
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time,
had
there
been
any
recoupment
or
counterclaim
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
question
is
that?
is
this
--
how
much
is
the
judgment
against
the
denial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
interest
in
the
day
of
the
judgement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
interest
before
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
you
went
back
now
and
tried
to
counterclaim
as
is
defined
here.
the
judgement
against
should
be
fair
given
so
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
will
lose
here
and
it
goes
back.
you
would
have
to
pay
there
before
that
judgment.
it
would
be
the
same
claim,
the
counterclaim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that'd
stayed
the
judgement
stays
but
it
entered
in
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
--
if
they
arise,
as
i
gather,
the
judgment
since
i
appealed
no
good,
its
just
there.
i
don't
suppose
the
court
with
that
evidence
run
on
a
matter
that
could
feel
as
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
if
you
ever
lose
here.
that's
what
i
want
to
emphasize
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
interest
goes
about
24,000-25,000
a
year,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
have
to
try
this
--
we
have
to
try
this
independent
counterclaim
with
this
valid
judgment
against
you
all
these
years
that
you
win
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
have
to
be
$125,000
that
united
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
trying
to
find
out
the
factual
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
judgment
does
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
bear
interest,
could
it,
it
would
be
set
aside.
they're
trying
to
keep
it
--
sent
it
back
down
now,
they
don't
want
that
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
lose
here,
do
you
have
any
argument
in
there
about
what
should
be
done
as
to
the
judgment
by
the
court
of
appeals?
if
that
judgment
is
not
--
that
judgment
should
be
considered
as
not
appealable
and
no
good.
i
suppose
you
--
you
could
argue
that
you
would
not
have
to
pay
the
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
you
would
argue
when
it
got
back,
entered
just
an
interlocutory
judgment
like
they
always
get
in
and
of
course
it
doesn't
bar
it
until
it's
final.
justice
hugo
l.
black
be
there
just
like
you'd
never
--
you'd
never
gone
up
and
wasn't
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
should
take
you
examined
them
by
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
interest
would
be
a
little
troublesome
if
it
went
along
too
long
and
it
is
not
considered
there,
interlocutory
judgment
falls
perfectly.
but
i
would
suppose
you'd
argue
that
this
is
not
an
interlocutory
judgment
that
deals
with
another
interlocutory
judgment
for
everything
else,
there's
no
interest,
it's
just
the
same
as
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it's
still
an
interlocutory
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
interlocutory
judgments
are
not
final
until
it
becomes
final
for
all
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
be
like
on
that
basis,
isn't
it?
you
win,
he
loses,
he
--
he
(inaudible)
if
you
lose,
he
wins,
if
he
loses,
you
win
on
the
interest
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
get
it
though,
did
you?
