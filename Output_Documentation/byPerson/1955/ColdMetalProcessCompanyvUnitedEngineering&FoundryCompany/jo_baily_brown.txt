mr.
jo.
baily
brown
may
it
please
the
court
sir.
i
don't
propose
to
expose
myself
and
my
ignorance
to
argue
into
this
court
its
rule
making
power.
i
do
not
question.
we
do
not
question
the
power
of
this
court
to
make
rule
54
(b).
we
do
not
question
the
purpose,
effect,
and
wording,
and
proper
interpretation
of
rule
54
(b).
we
are
here
standing
squarely
under
that
rule
and
it
has
been
applied
to
our
case
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
trial
judge
who
are
going
back
a
little
and
i
saw
--
try
not
to
repeat
what
mr.
webb
has
said.
there
was
a
litigation
between
these
parties
under
a
contract.
it
land
up
first
on
the
preliminary
injunction
motion
and
then
it
went
up
again
on
final
hearing
and
there
was
a
final
decision
made
on
the
contract
in
2991,
which
is
the
case,
the
parent
case
that's
here
before
you.
that
case
then
went
back
to
the
lower
court
and
appointed
a
master
to
determine
how
much
united
owed
to
cold
metal
under
the
contract
in
suit.
that
was
the
matter
that
was
referred
to
the
master.
the
master
took
10
years
on
this
partly
due
to
the
--
the
war
coming
in
between
and
due
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
brought
a
suit
to
have
the
parties
declared
void
for
having
been
obtained
by
fraud
in
the
patent
office
and
that
took
some
of
the
time
out
of
it.
but
there
was
a
10-year
long
proceeding
on
accounting
which
entered
in
a
decision
by
the
master
awarding
$387,000
plus
with
interest
of
6%
from
united
to
cold
metal.
now,
that
came
up
to
--
before
a
hearing
before
judge
wilson,
who
is
a
district
judge
having
charged
with
this
case
at
that
time.
and
it
was
argued
on
the
basis
of
the
master's
report
entirely
and
upon
the
record
entered
before
the
master.
nothing
else
was
presented
to
judge
wilson.
judge
wilson
heard
it,
took
exhausted
briefs,
gives
the
whole
aid
to
have
it
argued
and
finally
affirmed
the
master's
report,
and
sua
sponte
without
any
request
to
either
party
entered
a
final
judgement
and
an
order
confirming
the
master's
report
and
awarding
this
amount
with
interest
against
united.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
this
counterclaim
had
been
filed
several
years
before,
yes
sir.
i'll
come
back
to
that
just
a
minute.
now,
apparently
judge
wilson
thought
and
in
fact,
he
later
said
that
he
intended
to
enter
a
final
appealable
order
and
thought
that
he
was
doing
so.
i
thought
that
he
was
doing
so.
perhaps,
i
wasn't
conscious
as
i
am
now
about
54
(b).
in
fact,
i
know
i
wasn't.
and
i
may
have
overlooked
it,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
i
did
or
not
but
so
did
the
court.
we
took
an
appeal
and
so
did
cold
metal
when
there
wasn't
a
word
said
about
had
been
appealable
or
not
appealable.
both
parties
took
their
appeal.
we
talked
about
the
record.
we
entered
into
stipulation
as
to
what
was
going
to
the
record
and
after
the
time
had
run
out,
when
judge
wilson
could
do
anything
about
it.
then,
cold
metal
moved
to
dismiss
our
appeal
in
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
went
up
there
and
i
tried
to
say,
that
why
this
isn't
an
appealable
matter
because
it's
the
only
thing
in
2991.
that's
the
parent
case.
master's
report
was
the
only
thing
before
the
judge
and
he's
disposed
of
it.
but
in
effect,
the
judge
--
judge
maris
was
presiding
who
is
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
the
bendix
case
in
effect
and
i'm
not
trying
to
quote
him.
i'm
--
i
apologize
for
the
fact
that
the
transcript
of
record
before
judge
wilson
indicates
that
i
quoted
judge
maris.
that
was
--
that
was
an
error
of
the
--
the
reporter.
i
said
in
effect
it
said
and
i'm
saying
now.
in
effect,
judge
maris
said,
well,
gentlemen,
you've
got
rule
54
(b).
you
have
a
finding
what
has
been
called
the
counterclaim.
why
haven't
you
complied
with
that?"
well,
there
wasn't
much
i
could
say
and
i
don't
think
i
did
say
very
much
and
we
got
thrown
out
the
same
day.
our
appeal
was
dismissed.
but
in
judge
maris'
opinion
or
order,
he
said
without
prejudice
to
the
lower
court,
entering
a
final
judgment
in
compliance
with
54
(b).
so,
we
went
back
to
pittsburgh
and
gave
the
five
day
of
notice
which
our
opponents
required
of
asking
for
an
amended
order
and
went
before
judge
wilson.
judge
wilson
gave
us
a
long
hearing.
we
said
that
we
wanted
to
--
an
order
under
54
(b)
to
comply
with
it
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
dismissed
our
appeal
as
not
having
complied
with
54
(b).
mr.
webb
argued
at
great
length
just
as
we
had
here
today
that
the
court
had
no
power
to
enter
such
an
order,
and
if
it
did,
it
would
be
reversed
and
if
it
did
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
blah,
blah,
blah.
well,
judge
wilson's
--
the
transcript
to
the
argument
before
him
is
in
the
record
and
i'm
pretty
sure
the
judge
would
be
interested
in
it.
he
said
specifically,
why,
i
intended
to
enter
a
final
order
in
here.
i
thought
i
was
entering
a
final
order.
this
is
a
kind
of
case
that
ought
to
be
appealed.
i
won't
know
how
to
go
into
further
with
this
case
by
way
of
counterclaim
or
otherwise
until
i
have
decisions
from
the
court
of
appeals
on
questions
that
have
been
raised
on
the
master's
report
and
which
have
been
decided.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
i
think
i
can,
sir.
i'll
try.
strangely
as
it
may
seem,
although
this
is
a
suit
on
a
contract
provided
it's
under
a
patent
license
throughout
the
10
years
before
the
master.
cold
metal
maintained
that
the
license
have
never
been
issued,
had
never
been
possessed
by
united
and
that
there
was
no
license
in
effect.
now
that
was
--
the
master's
record
is
full
of
it
and
it's
clearly
appears
in
a
number
of
pages
in
the
record.
and
judge
wilson
although
he
affirmed
the
master's
report,
he
recognized
mr.
webb's
--
to
be
in
these
arguments
to
the
effect
that
we
had
no
license
and
had
nothing
really
to
be
paid
for
and
he
also
recognized
the
fact
that
our
--
that
the
mills
involved
upon
which
draws
that
had
been
assessed.
it
was
a
large
number
that
had
been
thrown
out
because
they
were
sold
in
foreign
countries
and
a
lot
of
questions
like
that,
that
would
affect
the
amount
of
judgment
that
would
eventually
be
recoverable
by
cold
metal.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
this
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
it
quite
--
it's
quite
so,
sir,
i
remember
that.
i
think
i
was
thought
that
in
law
school
about.
i
always
called
it
a
pot
instead
of
a
kettle
but
i
suppose
it
means
the
same
thing.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
but
there
are
other
questions
--
there
are
other
questions
involved
and
may
i
--
may
i
sir,
i
say
i
think
answering
your
question
point
out
some
other
things.
the
counterclaim,
that
is
the
so-called
counterclaim
that
is
pending
arose
out
of
transactions
occurring
after
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
heard
the
case
on
appeal
from
trial.
in
other
words,
cold
metal
had
maintained
then
as
it
still
does
that
united
had
no
license
rights
and
the
court
of
appeals
after
trial
it
said,
"yes,
you
have
this
license
rights
but
you
must
pay
for
them."
and
then
--
then
apparent
and
then
in
effect
left
the
case
there.
now
that
was
in
1939.
well
now,
instead
of
following
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
united
went
out
and
commenced
licensing
distilled
companies
unlimited.
and
i
used
the
word
"quoted"
because
it's
in
their
license
to
make
the
very
thing
that
united
was
licensed
to
do.
in
addition,
they
collected,
they
say
$28
million
and
then
it
was
later
placed
in
the
record
they
said,
they
collected
$30
million
in
this
field
which
normally
would
view
within
united
exclusive
license.
now,
judge
biggs
in
his
decision
on
190
f.2d
said
united
had
no
rights
that
could
it
litigate
until
after
our
decision
in
1939.
because
in
an
earlier
decision
by
the
same
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
have
said,
"this
contract
cannot
be
enforced.
it
lacks
terms
and
it
--
if
not
get
fully
specific
enforcement."
consequently,
your
honor,
i'm
answering
your
question
now,
there
were
issues
that
rose
in
there
after
1939
and
after
1940
and
contending
even
after
the
present
day
because
cold
metal
is
still
suing
republic
steel
company
and
united
states
government,
i
believe,
and
a
lot
of
other
companies
for
the
use
of
the
very
mills
upon
which
united
had
been
required
under
master's
report
to
the
order.
so
that
it
isn't
something
that
is
inherent
in
the
matter
that
was
before
the
master.
it's
inherent
in
the
things
that
occurred
since
and
it's
inherent
in
the
trial
of
the
case
which
requires
a
separate
trial.
because
before
to
master
these
things
--
well
that
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
we
would
all
set
any
payment
that
you
would
have
to
make,
yes
sir.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
but
i
don't
understand,
as
i
read
your
equity,
your
civil
rules
of
procedure
you
can
defeat
a
judgment
by
another
action
and
the
ancillary
--
ancillary
proceeding
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
if
it
wasn't
--
it
was
--
it
--
for
example
on
the
decision
in
1939,
the
court
said,
"you
have
an
exclusive
license.
you
must
pay
for
it."
now,
then,
we
say
that
they've
already
collected
more
than
that
much
money
from
their
customers
but
that
wasn't
before
the
master
and
couldn't
be
accounted
before
the
master
and
refused
to
have
any
part
of
it.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
it's
going
to
be
before
the
court
in
this
other
action.
and
now,
let
me
--
sir
come
back
to
this.
i
want
to
--
i
want
you
to
understand
how
this
thing
arose.
this
came
in
as
a
counterclaim
because
judge
biggs
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
made
a
start.
we
filed
an
ancillary
complaint
to
enforce
the
court's
decree
in
1939
and
in
--
and
the
2506
before
in
which
he
said
we
had
a
license
but
cold
metal
was
constantly
ignoring
it
and
defying
it
and
violating
it.
and
we
understood
and
you
correct
me,
sir.
we
understood
that
that
was
one
of
the
functions
of
an
ancillary
suit
to
enforce
the
decree
of
a
court
after
it
had
become
final.
and
we
filed
an
ancillary
of
cross
complaint.
and
we
filed
it
in
the
district
court
where
cold
metal
had
pending
a
litigation
and
we
went
clear
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
lower
courts
says
it's
not
ancillary
and
threw
it
out.
well,
judge
biggs
said
it's
clearly
ancillary,
there's
no
question
about
that
why
it
should
have
been
a
counterclaim.
it
should
not
have
been
ancillary
to
it.
it
should
have
been
a
counterclaim.
well
i've
always
found
that
you
get
along
faster
ruling
with
the
court
and
then
you're
trying
to
form.
so
we
went
back,
still
convinced
that
it
was
properly
an
ancillary
suit
and
we
called
it,
and
the
man
did
ancillary
complaint
and
in
part
the
counterclaim
and
that's
the
way
it
stands
today.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
let
me
--
let
me
come
down
to
two
or
three
other
things.
mr.
--
my
opponent
has
argued,
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
rule
is
beyond
the
rule
making
power
of
this
court.
now
i'm
not
going
in
to
that
at
all
except
that
i
might
be
ask
questions.
we
have
no
doubt
of
it
being
properly
within
the
rule
making
power
of
the
court.
and
i
have
enough
presumption
to
try
to
tell
you
anyhow
if
i
even
thought
it
wasn't.
i
think
that's
--
you
made
the
rule
and
you've
got
to
deal
with
it.
that's
the
way
i
look
at
it.
as
far
as
i'm
concern,
it's
a
good
rule.
so
far
as
the
third
circuit
is
concerned,
it's
a
good
rule
and
we
stand
on
the
bendix
case
which
applies
to
us.
now,
these
--
a
lot
of
these
preliminary
questions
and
the
ones
that
you
are
--
honor
judge
--
mr.
justice
frank
was
asked
had
been
brought
up
before
the
trial
court.
mr.
webb
argued
to
judge
wilson,
"well,
you
can't
enter
a
final
decision
in
this
case.
you've
got
pending
a
counterclaim
over
here.
it's
like
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
counterclaim.
this
field,
the
case
i've
decided,
this
is
2991
and
the
pleadings
and
everything.
and
everything
the
master
did
is
before
me
and
that's
what
i'm
deciding,
that's
what
i
intend
to
decide
finally
and
there's
nothing
else
before
me
and
you
didn't
raise
anything
else
before
me,
mr.
webb."
and
that's
the
way
it
was.
now,
we
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
same
thing
came
up.
the
only
thing
that
was
argued
in
our
first,
in
the
first
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
54
(b).
that
we
have
that
complied
with
54
(b).
now,
i
don't
want
to
misstate
mr.
webb's
position
in
his
motion
or
his
brief.
he
did
have
a
sense
or
to
which,
in
effect,
said
this
is
not
a
final
decision
and
couldn't
become
under
54
(b).
but
everything
they
argue
about
it
before
that
court
was
whether
or
not
we
have
to
comply
with
54
(b).
and
we
found
that
we
did
have
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
oh,
yes.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
oh,
yes,
sir.
and
this
--
this
was
our
--
all
of
these
has
happened
within
a
year.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
just
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
the
bendix
case
had
been
decided
before
we
got
up
there
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
--
all
of
these
happened
last
year.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
we
thought
so
and
as
we
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
that
was
the
law
in
that
circuit
and
when
we
complied
with
it,
we
were
there.
but
i
want
to
make
this
point,
sir.
cold
metal's
counsel
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
argued
to
judge
wilson,
"if
you
give
this
order
under
54
(b),
you
will
be
exceeding
your
discretion."
and
he
said
in
effect,
"you'll
be
reverse
for
the
court
of
appeals.
and
maybe
--
maybe
use
the
word
correcting."
then
when
they
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
same
argument
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
spite
of
its
active
arguments
here
today,
said,
"why
this
is
the
very
kind
of
case
that
the
rule
was
written
to
provide
it
for.
to
take
away
this
doubt
about
multiple
claims
when
one
of
them
has
been
adjudicated
and
the
trial
court
thinks
that
and
go
up
on
appeal,
he
can
say,
"i'm
going
to
enter
a
final
judgment
disposing
this
claim
and
i'm
going
to
certify,
there's
no
reason
for
delay
and
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
the
court
of
appeals."
now,
to
say
that,
"just
what
it's
for,"
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
do."
and
i
might
add,
sir,
because
i
think
it
may
have
some
effect
on
you
pursuant
to
their
refusal
on
the
second
motion
to
dismiss.
the
case
was
briefed
and
argued
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
tuesday,
i
think,
of
october
after
these
two
dilatory
motions
were
dismissed.
we
ask
the
court
to
expedite
that
case
because
it's
tremendously
important
to
us
because
our
customers
are
--
still
being
sued
for
making
--
for
using
the
very
mills
upon
which
we've
been
held
over
royalty.
and
those
cases
are
going
on,
one
of
them
spending
now
in
the
sixth
circuit
of
appeals
against
republic
steel
company.
so,
we
ask
the
court
to
expedite
the
appeal.
to
let
us
have
a
summer
session
and
get
through
with.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
do
that
but
they
said,
"we'll
put
you
down
for
the
first
case
in
the
fall"
which
they
did.
we
went
on
the
first
case
arguing
the
fall
and
we
argued
down
there
for
a
whole
day
and
both
side
filed-exhaust
their
briefs.
and
these
questions
of
jurisdiction
were
all
more
or
less
referred
to
but
the
court
said,
"we
have
this
case.
we're
going
to
decide
it."
then
the
following
monday,
this
court
handed
down
--
allowed
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
so
far
--
we,
of
course,
we
don't
know
what's
in
the
court's
mind
but
we
assume
that
they're
waiting
until
this
court
exposes
for
this
jurisdictional
question.
suppose
in
a
way
mr.
webb
raised
it,
it's
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
whether
you
had
power
to
make
the
rule
which
the
third
circuit
has
applied
to
us.
now,
i
don't
think
really
that
there's
much
else
from
we'd
argued
here
beyond
answering
your
questions.
it's
--
we
are
caught
in
the
--
we
are
caught
in
the
way
in
the
--
in
the
cogs
of
a
wheel
here.
we
--
we
believe
where
--
we
--
we
complied
with
54
(b)
as
we
understood
it.
and
the
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
sir,
i
thought
about
that
and
for
what
will
--
of
course
i'll
say
it.
i
think
you'd
have
a
chaos
below.
if
you
should
say
this
rule
is
invalid,
we
had
no
right
to
make
this
rule
and
we're
going
to
wipe
it
out
then
it
will
be
cleared.
we
would
go
back
and
take
an
appeal,
not
under
the
rule
and
we
would
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
tell
us
whether
we
were
there
or
not.
but
if
you
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
because
of
certain
commodity
on
my
associates,
we
put
that
in
as
a
kind
of
anchored
of
when
words.
but
frankly,
it
isn't
my
argument.
i
--
i
think
we
are
smacked
under
54
(b).
i
think
it's
a
good
rule
and
we
well
understand
it.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
may
i
--
may
i
--
well,
may
i
interrupt
you,
sir,
i
must
make
an
apology.
i
do
think
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out
that
there
were
and
judge
maris
did
in
his
opinion,
there
were
certain
special
cases,
exceptional
cases
where
this
court
has
said
that
a
trial
court
can
make
a
partial
disposition
of
a
case
and
let
part
of
it
go
out.
now,
since
this
was
a
case
that's
going
on
for
10
years
and
since
it
was
decided
and
requested
before
the
master
and
since
it
has
these
other
very
important
things,
i
would
have
thought
if
you
wipe
out
the
rule
then
the
court
of
appeals
might
say,
"we'll
take
it
anyhow."
now
that,
i
think,
would
probably
be
issuing
a
discretion
then
the
court
of
appeals
did
decide
whether
it
was
observation
finality
to
prevented
that.
do
i
answer
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
let
me
--
let
me
answer
that
question.
i
think
it's
graphical.
before
the
master,
you
barely
took
the
position
that
the
rate
of
gross
here
to
be
place
under
the
license.
it's
determined
by
two
letters
that
had
been
exchanged
between
the
parties.
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
found
that
those
did
--
evidence
and
understanding
which
the
master
of
a
lower
court
could
supply
to
the
contract
as
the
rate
are
broadening.
and
that's
what
the
master
did
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
lower
court.
but
cold
metal
insists,
"well
i
know
that's
not
the
right
way.
we
order
to
take
every
mill
that
united
has
built,"
and
they
run
into
hundreds
and
they
run
into
hundreds
of
millions
and
find
out
how
much
it
cost
to
build
them,
how
much
profit
has
been
made
by
those
mills,
how
much
tonnage
has
been
rolled
on
them,
what
would
be
a
fair
rule
per
tonnage,
and
that's
what
they
want
to
try
in
this
case
and
that's
what
they
would
try
to
try.
if
you
should
say
a
way
that
to
throw
this
out
and
you've
got
to
go
back
and
try
to
counterclaim
before
you
try
the
others.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
i
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well
now,
that's
another
--
isn't
that
--
that's
--
i
didn't
mention
to
you
that
what
mr.
webb
told
you
that
this
counterclaim
was
set
down
to
court
trial
before
judge
miller,
was
a
different
judge
from
judge
miller.
before
--
after
the
master's
report
had
come
down.
but
before
objections
had
been
filed
to
any
party
and
judge
miller
called
it
before
him
and
said,
"now,
here
i
am
and
i
have
orders
to
try
this
case."
and
mr.
webb
and
i
joined
the
other
and
say,
"well,
this
counterclaim
should
not
be
tried
until
after
the
master's
report
is
disposed
of."
now
i
don't
--
i'm
not
criticizing
mr.
webb
that
he
interpolated
that.
he
says,
until
the
objections
are
disposed
of,
that
isn't
what
we
said
and
that
isn't
what
judge
miller
said.
he
says
that
parties
who
want
to
dispose
of
the
master's
report
before
this
is
tried
and
among
other
things
because
they
should
think.
that
disposition
of
the
master's
report
finally
may
render
on
this
as
certified
suit.
that's
in
judge
miller's
order
which
is
in
our
record.
so,
that
--
we
argued
--
held
here
judge
miller,
judge
wilson,
the
third
circuit
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
three
powers.
we've
been
up
there
before
three
powers.
judge
biggs
sat
with
one
judge,
judge
maris
sat
with
another,
judge
goodrich
sat
with
another
they
all
agreed
with
that
this
case
should
go
up
and
should
be
on
appeal.
and
that
the
lower
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion,
what
acted
within
the
scope
of
the
rule
as
they
interpreted
and
that
we
have
thought
they
are
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
$387,650
with
interest
from
may
1954.
interest
of
6%
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
that's
what
the
court
held.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
yes.
the
master
held
no
interest
was
due
in
view
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
that
runs
nearly
$2000
a
month.
and
that's
running
against
us
now.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
the
judgment
was
stayed
when
we
took
our
appeal
as
you
know
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
if
we
file
and
we
rather
lose.
well,
i
suppose
the
interests
were
on
this,
it's
been
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
--
i
can't
speculate
on
that.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
we
feel
very
certain
that
we're
going
to
win
and
when
we
get
into
the
third
--
with
that
on
the
--
on
--
on
the
record
and
argument
that
has
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
yes,
sir.
just
about
--
about
nearly
$2000
a
month.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
filed
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
that
could
happen
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
if
--
well,
[laughs]
i
like
--
i
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
yes.
and
i
--
i
can't
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
i
can't
be
sure
that
i
could
answer
all
the
ramifications
of
that
in
order
in
the
question
at
this
time.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
the
judgment
bares
interest
at
6%.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
no,
they
--
i
think
they
want
the
judgment
to
stay
there
and
they
want
it
to
be
final
but
they
want
to
delay
this
case
for
about
three
more
years
while
they
are
shaking
down
people
like
republic
steel
corporation
and
other
big
companies
which
they
are
now
suing
as
infringes
of
the
very
patent
upon
which
we
are
required
to
pay
royalty
and
interest
on
their
right.
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
of
course,
i
think
that
depend
a
good
deal
on
what
this
court
says
and
the
basis
upon
which
they
reverse,
if
they
did
reverse.
if
they
should
reverse
by
saying
54
(b)
was
an
invalid
exercise
of
our
rule
making
power
and
we
made
something
appealable
that's
not
in
accord
with
the
1291
section,
why
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
we
know.
i
--
i
have
--
now,
i
have
--
of
course
i'm
not
committed
with
this
but
my
present
feeling
is
that
we
would
go
back
and
say,
"well,
54
(b)
has
been
wiped
out
at
the
supreme
court."
now,
you'll
have
to
decided
whether
without
54
(b),
you'll
have
an
appealable
case
before
and
we
have
said
--
we
ask
that
you
treat
it
as
such
and
proceed
with
it.
now,
if
they
said,
"well,
the
only
reason
we
took
the
case
was
54
(b)
then
we'd
be
thrown
back
into
the
lower
courts."
then
quite
possibly
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
it
could
be.
it
might
be.
i'm
not
sure
just
presently.
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
well,
it
would
be
pretty
troublesome,
i
can
say
that
from
any
point
of
view.
it
would
be
troublesome
for
one
side
to
the
other.
now,
if
--
if
i
may
--
mr.
jo.
baily
brown
that's
probably
so
and
then
we
would
probably
say
that
when
you
heard
our
counterclaim,
there
would
be
no
judgment
because
there
will
be
an
offset
here
and
there's
no
--
no
final
result.
but
--
may
i
say
these
one
or
two
words
along
the
line
of
just
a
practicing
lawyer.
we
have
these
problems
all
the
time
of
whether
or
not
at
the
final
judgment
and
i
know
judge
wilson
said
to
us,
it's
in
his
report,
is
we
have
these
things
all
the
time,
is
the
trouble
as
whether
we'd
know
whether
it
--
we
should
make
this
a
final
judgment.
and
when
we
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
remember
judge
goodrich
said,
"well,
we
have
these
cases
coming
up
here
all
the
time.
now,
you've
got
54
(b),
why
don't
you
people
act
under
it.
that
removes
the
trouble
and
difficulty
that
we
have
of
this
thing."
now,
that's
the
attitude
if
i
may
presume
to
speak
purposely
and
i
think,
they
think
you
have
good
rule
that
is
workable,
that
it
takes
away
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
as
to
when
a
partial
decision
is
appealable
or
not
appealable.
so
far
as
i
know
at
the
present
time,
i
think,
the
second
circuit
has
withdrawn
the
opinions
in
which
they
attack
the
rule
as
giving
undue
power
to
the
trial
courts,
and
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
couldn't
--
well,
i
can't
blame
them.
as
far
as
i
know,
all
of
the
cases
in
which
they
have
been
directly
involved,
54
(b)
and
an
application
of
it
are
now
in
favor
of
the
rule
and
for
applying
it
provided
it
supplied
with
proper
discretion
to
a
claim
which
has
been
settled
even
though
other
claims
whether
it
would
be
called
counterclaims,
cross
claims
or
what,
of
course,
the
alternative.
may
i
--
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
patience.
