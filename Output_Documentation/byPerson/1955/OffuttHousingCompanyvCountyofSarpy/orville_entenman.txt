mr.
orville
entenman
--
please
the
court,
your
honors.
in
answering
the
one
question,
i'll
be
calling
your
attention
to
the
nebraska
authority
for
taxing
the
leasehold
or
the
interest
of
offutt
housing
company
in
this
matter
of
proceeding.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
decision
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
it's
set
out
in
the
record
at
page
206
quoting
from
judge
chappell's
opinion.
this
court
in
ashby
versus
peters,
a
nebraska
case,
page
1
--
206,
the
last
paragraph,
held
that
saved
for
the
purposes
of
convincing
a
lease
of
more
than
one
year
is
not
real
estate
and
also
it
quotes
another
case.
generally,
a
leasehold
for
a
term
of
years
is
a
chattel
real
falling
within
the
classification
of
personal
property.
for
all
practical
purposes,
it
maybe
equivalent
to
those
absolute
ownership.
in
that
connection,
he
sets
out
section
77-1209
of
the
revised
statutes
in
nebraska
for
1943,
which
provide
all
improvements
put
on
leased
public
lands.
i
might
stop
right
there
and
say
that
was
particularly
up
and
go
in
nebraska
on
school
lands
where
they
had
been
leased
and
the
improvements
did
not
become
the
property
of
the
state
or
the
owner
of
the
school
land.
it
shall
be
assessed
to
the
owner
of
such
improvements
as
personal
property.
now,
the
next
phrase
“together
with
the
value
of
the
lease
and
listed
and
assessed
in
a
place
where
the
land
is
situated.
now
after
the
--
during
the
construction
of
offutt
housing
buildings,
they
were
not
complete
on
the
assessment
date
of
march
10th,
1952.
they
were
complete
--
not
completed
and
that
is
the
date
set
out
by
nebraska
for
the
ownership
for
personal
property.
every
person
corporation
must
lease
a
property
they
own
on
march
10th
of
that
year.
however,
they
were
completed
in
june.
the
law
also
requires
that
each
one
leased
for
assessment
is
property
valued.
that
was
not
done
except
for
some
furniture
and
fixtures.
the
assessor
then
later
in
june
assessed
this
property.
first,
the
fixtures
and
the
office
equipment
in
the
amount
of
$205.
the
appliances,
that
was
the
ranges,
the
electric
stoves
or
gas
stoves,
the
electric
refrigerators,
and
remember
there
were
611
of
them.
the
washing
machines
and
equipment
of
that
type
purchased
by
offutt
housing
and
placed
here
also
base
on
chattel
mortgages
and
conditional
sales
contracts
filed
in
the
county,
valued
them
at
$69,695.
then
the
buildings,
he
arrived
with
his
valuation
there
by
determining
that
they
were
only
75%
completed
on
the
assessment
day
of
1952.
then
basing
his
valuation
from
an
inspection
also
from
this
mortgage
of
$4,950,000.he
determined
that
the
value
of
that,
75%
complete
and
assessing
it
in
comparison
with
light,
property
in
the
county,
residential
property,
buildings
knowing
the
value
of
them
and
what
he
was
putting
on
them,
he
valued
that
in
1955,
$755,000,
a
$5
million
project.
i
don't
think
they
can
complain
here
that
we've
taxed
any
more
than
offutt
housing
company's
interest.
and
no
objection
was
made
to
that
assessment.
and
of
course,
the
nebraska
law
provides
that
where
the
taxpayer
does
not
file
the
schedule
and
the
assessor
does
it,
that
he
must
send
notice
to
the
taxpayer
and
he
has
a
right
to
come
in
before
the
board
of
equalization,
that
was
not
done.
then,
we've
checked
the
1953
assessment.
those
assessments
pair
in
the
complete
record
or
the
record
here
at
page
144
(a)
and
144
(b).i
like
to
comment
just
a
bit
on
the
distinction
between
the
1953
and
the
1952
assessment.
nebraska
getting
to
some
trouble
on
their
revaluations
and
making
comparison
between
personal
property
and
real
estate.
and
i've
point
out
here,
there
is
no
tax
on
the
real
estate.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
attempt
to
tax
any
real
estate
leased
in
this
case.
but
in
the
personal
property
field,
there
were
some
changes.
first,
they
do
to
a
decision
in
the
nebraska
court
which
mandamus
the
--
for
the
--
or
the
tax
commission
that
lengthens
state
tax
commission
to
value
property
as
its
actual
value.
and
as
a
result
of
that
then,
you
will
see
in
the
valuation
for
1953,
it
is
now
considered
75%
or
100%
completed,
then,
all
residential
property
in
the
state
or
particularly
sarpy
county,
partly
in
douglas
was
given
a
40%
increase
on
the
valuation.
for
here,
there
were
$4000
houses,
that
is
only
valued
at
$800
and
$900.
they
got
them
up
40%.
in
other
words,
if
your
assessed
value
had
been
a
thousand
dollars
in
1952,
in
1953,
that
would
probably
been
$1400.
there
was
a
40%
increase.
well
at
least,
they
got
the
same
increase.
and
--
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
mr.
orville
entenman
well,
i
really
believe,
your
honor,
that
this
court,
that
the
--
that
the
determination
of
the
tax,
the
validity
of
the
tax
is
the
question
for
the
state
of
nebraska
in
the
state
court.and
they
admit
it
in
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
i
think
what
this
court
has
got
to
be
concerned
with
have
we
taxed
any
property
of
the
united
states
belonging
to
the
government.
now,
the
--
the
question
here
and
our
court
held
that
this
was
properly
taxed
as
personal
property
under
the
leasehold.
mr.
orville
entenman
that's
right.
mr.
orville
entenman
no,
we
couldn't.
mr.
orville
entenman
well,
that's
correct.
we
--
we
feel
that
this
--
that
it
couldn't
be
taxed
as
real
property.
it
would
be
no
--
under
the
nebraska
law.
mr.
orville
entenman
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
orville
entenman
that's
right.
mr.
orville
entenman
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
orville
entenman
that's
what
i
do.
whether
--
whether
we've
taxed
any
nebraska
property
or
any
property
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
orville
entenman
if
the
--
if
the
lease
and
--
mr.
orville
entenman
if
they
can
find
their
tax
and
assessment
to
the
leasehold
--
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
mr.
orville
entenman
it
would.
mr.
orville
entenman
that's
right
and
we
--
mr.
orville
entenman
and
we
contend
here
that
the
leasehold
is
taxable.
now
--
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
mr.
orville
entenman
the
house
and
lot
both
belong
to
me.
i
would
pay
the
taxes.
there
would
be
no
tax
on
the
leasehold.
as
i
say
where
the
leasehold
interest
has
come
in
to
be
considered
in
nebraska
is
where
the
school
lands
particularly
are
leased
to
individuals,
and
they
put
the
improvements
on
them.
and
when
that
lease
is
sold,
for
the
period
of
five
or
ten
years
the
improvements
are
sold
separately.
there
--
there's
also
a
sale
event.
and
for
taxation
purposes,
the
improvements
are
taxed
separately
then
the
value
of
the
leasehold
interest
in
that
public
land.
mr.
orville
entenman
we
say
it
does
because
we
say
this
is
public
land.
that
these
are
the
--
mr.
orville
entenman
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
orville
entenman
the
public.
mr.
orville
entenman
and
just
--
mr.
orville
entenman
that
was
section
12,
section
77-1209
of
the
revised
statutes
of
nebraska
and
i
just
--
that
was
set
out
in
page
207
of
the
record.
i
just
quoted
it
and
it
was
setout
in
the
supreme
court
decision
at
nebraska.
mr.
orville
entenman
oh
yes.
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
should
affect
this
decision.
if
you'll
find
that
the
leasehold
interest
here,
that
the
interest
that
offutt
housing
company
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
title
to
the
land
which
we
haven't
taxed
the
real
estate
at
all,
their
land
underneath,
nor
have
we
taxed
any
value
at
this
time
in
the
leasehold
in
that.
now
what
we
have
taxed
here
to
arrive
at
our
value
is
the
value
of
these
buildings
and
as
our
nebraska
court
found
here
we
were
taxing
the
leasehold
interest.
mr.
orville
entenman
no.
mr.
orville
entenman
in
quoting
this
section
77-1209
again,
it
says,
“all
improvements
put
on
leased
public
lands
shall
be
assessed
to
the
owner
of
such
improvements
as
personal
property,
then,
i
claimed
the
next
three
words
together
with
the
value
of
the
lease.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
have
both
interest
there
that
the
value
of
the
lease
without
the
ownership
of
the
building.
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
mr.
orville
entenman
i
think
that
i
should
say
this.
we
didn't
want
to
mislead
this
court
that
we
distinguish
between
any
valuation
there.
and
i
think
i
can
develop
that
briefly
here
that
there
is
no
value
that
you
can
claim
that
we
assess
that
belong
to
the
federal
government
today
in
those
buildings
because
the
federal
government
has
not
placed
one
dime
of
money
into
this
project.
not
one
cent.
it
has
come
mostly
from
the
manufacturer's
trust
and
whatever
money
that
carl
wilson
built
and
then
he
was
the
president
of
the
contractor
company
and
also
the
president
of
the
offutt
housing
company
that
now
has
a
lease.
and
i
--
i
wish
to
point
out
further
here
that
the
--
the
tax
that
is
levied
on
this
assessment
will
never
be
a
burden
on
the
united
states.
mr.
orville
entenman
we
think
that
is
the
position
that
there
isn't
any
--
there
would
be
no
other
result
no
matter
how
you
interpreted
this.
that
--
mr.
orville
entenman
i
mean
in
the
amount
of
the
assessment.
mr.
orville
entenman
that's
right.
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
now
i'd
like
to
point
this
out
further
though
in
--
in
denominating
this
as
personal
tax.
now,
there
can
never
be
any
lien
against
the
interest
of
the
government
here.
and
if
you
will
examine
this
record,
they
have
agreed
to
pay
this
tax
by
the
lease.
there's
a
clause
right
in
the
lease
that
they
will
pay
any
taxes
that
are
assessed
on
this
property.
the
mortgage
provides
that
and
they
will
may
--
their
--
their
monthly
payments
on
these
fha
mortgage
just
like
any
other
requires
that
they
pay
a
certain
amount
each
month
to
take
care
of
this
tax.
mr.
orville
entenman
of
--
mr.
orville
entenman
now
that,
is
if
there
is
--
that
comes
into
play
only
if
there
is
any
consent
by
congress
that
this
land
that
this
is
sitting
on
should
also
--
mr.
orville
entenman
no,
that
was
not
the
wording
of
that
section.
i
think
there
has
been
some
confusing
or
fusion
on
that,
because
that's
the
section
6
of
the
1947
act
provided
there
that
the
lessee's
interest
--
mr.
orville
entenman
well,
the
lease
has
the
same
thing.
they
make
provision
too
that
there
be
a
--
a
renegotiation
of
the
contract
in
case
that
congress
would
say
that
the
real
estate
here
that
is
the
building
that
you're
sitting
on
should
now
be
valued
at
some
$350
an
acre
property.
it's
the
value
around
there.
it
can
be
assessed
maybe
at
a
hundred
but
that
has
never
been
assessed
since
it
was
--
became
the
federal
government.
now
i
point
out
here
though
that
there
will
be
no
lien,
because,
first,
the
statute
i
just
read
you
gives
you
--
gives
them
a
personal
action
in
personam
that
you
stated
in
many
other
cases
here
against
the
offutt
housing
company
not
against
the
united
states.
and
if
there
is
any
lien
on
this
leasehold
interest,
then,
i
believe
that
the
property,
the
lien
that
nebraska
would
have
be
gone
if
that
lease
would
cancel,
we
would
have
nothing.
mr.
orville
entenman
yes.
mr.
orville
entenman
no.
we
could
--
mr.
orville
entenman
the
tax
for
the
1952
was
$10,000
roughly
it's
in
matter
of
dollars,
and
in
1953,
due
to
that
change
in
valuation,
it
went
to
$15,000
and
i
like
to
have
you
examine
this
project
analysis
in
here
in
which
there
was
a
figure
for
$13000
per
street.
and
your
honors,
i
can't
see
how
for
really
help
for
10
blocks
the
streets
is
all
that's
been
here,
they
could
ever
spend
$10,000
or
$13,000.
mr.
orville
entenman
nothing
further
than
the
mortgage,
i
believe,
and
the
conditional
sales
contracts
on
the
individual.
mr.
orville
entenman
$4,950,000.
