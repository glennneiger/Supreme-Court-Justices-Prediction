mr.
robert
l.
stern
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
back
here
again
and
to
find
the
solicitor
general
and
i
still
on
the
same
side.
this
is
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
property
tax
by
the
county
of
sarpy
in
nebraska
against
imposed
upon
a
housing
project
built
for
military
tenants
and
a
military
reservation
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
united
states.
the
taxpayer
or
petitioner
here
is
a
private
company
which
has
leased
the
land
and
buildings
from
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
75
years.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
this
tax
is
invalid
because
it
is
imposed
upon
territory
which
is
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
that
congress
has
not
waived
the
immunity
from
state
taxation
of
that
territory
for
this
project.
and
secondly,
if
the
court
should
disagree
as
to
that,
the
only
statute
which
conceivably
permits
taxation
with
respect
to
this
project
is
the
one
authorizing
taxation
of
the
lessee's
interest
and
this
tax
here
was
not
imposed
upon
any
lessee's
interest
but
on
the
property
itself
which
belongs
to
the
united
states.
the
--
the
project
was
directed
under
the
wherry
military
housing
act
of
1949.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i'm
not
sure
what
they
mean,
your
honor,
but
i'm
sure
they're
wrong.
because
the
uncontradicted
evidence
is
that
the
--
they
assessed
their
tax
to
that
--
i
can
tell
you
what
they
mean,
i
--
i
shouldn't
have
said
that.
the
--
that
their
opinion
as
a
whole
means
that
they
interpret
the
whole
factual
language
as
putting
the
ownership
of
these
buildings
in
the
petitioner
and
therefore,
they
say
it
is
proper
to
tax
the
petitioners,
lessee
--
the
lessee,
the
petitioner
as
owner
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
buildings.
and
they
have
to
come
to
that
result,
your
honor,
in
order
to
sustain
the
tax
because
the
only
nebraska
statute,
they
sight
which
would
sustain
this
tax
just
--
was
set
forth
at
page
37
of
our
brief
says,
a
lot
of
taxation
of
this
such
property
to
the
owner
and
therefore
--
and
that's
the
premise
of
their
decision.
i'll
deal
with
that
at
some
length.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
yes,
the
assessment
form
is
the
--
except
that
it's
copied
on
page
144
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
of
the
record,
the
assessment
form.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
it
says,
"improvements
on
leased
land,"
down
at
the
bottom.
this
is
the
form
the
assessor
filled
up
but
the
--
our
client
didn't
fill
out
any
form
because
we
didn't
think
we
were
liable.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
it's
called
a
schedule
for
personal
property
taxes
in
which
he
puts
down
his
estimate
of
the
value
of
these
things.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
and
then
down
--
further
down
improvements
on
leased
land.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
and
then
--
the
whole
thing
is
under
the
business
classified,
apartment
house
as
you
can
see.
and
apart
from
--
if
there's
any
doubt
as
to
what
that
means,
the
assessor
himself
testified
under
examination
that
he
was
taxing
the
value
of
the
building.
he's
talking
just
about
the
buildings
which
as
i
mentioned
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
but
he
said
orally
too.
in
the
testimony,
he
was
taxing
the
value
of
the
building.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
there's
no
question
about
the
land,
the
value
of
the
buildings
but
not
a
lessee's
--
but
not
merely
the
lessee's
interest
in
the
building.
although,
if
they
don't
know
the
--
if
the
petitioner,
we
don't
own
the
buildings,
but
the
government
owns
the
buildings.
they're
taxing
all
the
value
of
the
buildings
and
they're
taxing
the
government's
interest
and
not
the
lessee's
interest.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
explain
--
i
will
explain
all
that.
this
statute
resulted
from
the
fact
that
housing
conditions
that
are
military
reservations
in
1949
and
in
some
extent
still
were
deplorable
and
that
house
--
and
that
military
personnel
who
wish
to
have
their
families
with
them
were
forced
to
live
under
very
bad
conditions
and
pay
exorbitant
rents
for
housing.
as
they
--
in
order
to
meet
this,
to
meet
the
laws
of
personnel
which
resulted
to
the
--
to
the
military
force
which
resulted
from
this
and
there
was
testimony
before
the
congress
that
this
was
the
--
the
greatest
reason
for
losing
military
personnel
in
adequate
housing.
this
--
the
fha
authority
was
expanded
under
the
statute
to
permit
it
to
ensure
housing
to
be
built
on
or
adjacent
to
these
reservations.
when
the
secretary
of
the
defense
of
the
air
force
or
whatever
it
might
be
certified
that
there
was
a
need.
the
statute
also
authorized
the
leasing
of
government
land
for
the
construction
of
this
project
and
this
was
done
for
two
reasons.
the
first
was
that
land
owned
by
the
united
states
often
was
the
only
land
close
enough
and
suitable
enough
for
use
to
fill
this
demand.
and
the
other
reason
according
to
the
committee
reports
was
that
that
would
enable
the
land
to
be
obtained
at
nominal
cost
so
that
the
rents
to
the
military
subtenants
would
be
lower.
the
object
of
course
was
to
provide
them
with
housing
at
a
low
cost
that
was
feasible,
when
this
case
arises
on
the
offutt
airbase,
the
headquarters
of
the
strategic
air
command
near
omaha,
nebraska
and
area
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
the
project
was
--
the
land
was
leased
to
the
petitioner
for
75
years.
a
nominal
rent
was
charged
in
order
to
keep
the
cost
down,
a
rent
with
$100
a
year.
the
lease
provided
that
the
buildings
belong
to
the
united
states
as
i've
said
and
i
have
more
to
say
about
that
later.
the
buildings
were
completed
and
occupied
by
1952.
now,
there
are
many
government
--
governmental
controls
left
over
this
project.
this
wasn't
just
a
lease
of
land
to
somebody
and
then
he's
left
alone
to
do
what
he
wanted.
the
government
assumes
demand
financial
risk
by
assuming
the
mortgage.
it
limited
the
amount
which
could
be
invested
for
apartment
unit
and
in
the
interest
rate.
more
importantly,
it
determines
and
controls
the
maximum
rentals.
and
the
record
shows
that
the
rentals
were
established
on
the
assumption
that
no
property
tax
would
be
imposed
and
if
they
were
the
rentals
would
be
raised
upward
to
the
military
personnel,
so
they
would
have
to
pay
for
that.
the
--
not
only
does
the
government
determine
what
the
rent
shall
be
or
the
maximum
rent,
it
determine
who
may
live
in
the
project.
they've
got
to
--
we've
got
to
let
live
in
the
project
whatever
military
employees
that
commander
tells
us.
the
lease
controls
the
length
of
subleases
so
as
to
make
sure
that
military
tenants
can
get
out
after
a
year
on
a
month-to-month
basis
or
if
they're
transferred
or
if
their
service
is
terminated.
the
lease
can't
be
assigned.
government
controls
standard
and
maintenance
to
some
extent.
the
property
can't
be
remodeled
without
the
--
or
changed
any
substantial
way
without
government
approval.
and
the
commander's
rules
with
respect
to
safety
and
so
forth,
the
commander
of
the
airbase,
they
must
be
observed
by
the
petitioner
or
lessee
here.
now,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
federal
government
or
petitioner
provides
the
main
governmental
services
to
the
land
upon
which
this
project
is
built.
the
air
force
itself
provides
fire
and
police
protection,
sewage,
water
service
are
connected
with
the
air
force
main.
roads
on
the
project
are
built
by
the
petitioner
and
the
access
roads
are
built
by
the
air
force.
a
number
of
these
services,
the
petitioner
pay
the
air
force
for
or
the
tenants
directly
or
indirectly
pay
for
it
through
the
rent
or
directly
to
utility.
this
case
doesn't
involve
school
taxes.
the
area
is
not
in
a
school
district
and
the
reason
is
that
the
federal
government
under
another
statute
finances
the
schooling
for
the
people
who
have
on
this
project.
so,
the
main
governmental
services
which
cost
money
are
not
provided
by
sarpy
county.
and
this
refutes
respondent's
argument,
if
i
may
anticipate
a
little,
that
it's
unfair
not
to
have
local
taxes
paid
by
this
project.
on
the
contrary,
the
equities
are
all
the
other
way.
since
the
county
doesn't
provide
these
services
and
the
federal
government
or
petitioner
do,
it
would
unfair
to
charge
them,
to
make
them
pay
taxes
to
what
they
don't
get.
and
particularly,
since
the
tenants
have
to
pay
for
a
lot
of
these
services
as
i've
said
once
directly
to
the
federal
government
or
to
petitioner.
now,
as
i've
also
said
no
return
was
filed
by
the
petitioner
here.
the
assessor
filled
out
a
return
in
which
he
placed,
said
what
he
thought
the
value
of
the
buildings
was,
he
didn't
say
anything
about
the
lessee's
interest
and
the
case
was
brought
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
for
sarpy
county
and
what
i
think
and
not
merely
because
it
went
our
way,
is
an
excellent,
of
oral
opinion
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari.
he
held
that
the
tax
was
imposed
on
the
building.
there
was
no
attempt
to
attack
the
lessee's
interest
that
the
buildings
were
the
property
of
the
united
states
that
the
lessee's
in
the
statute
couldn't
possibly
be
applicable
and
he
expressed
in
his
opinion
some
doubt
as
to
whether
it
would
be
anyhow
and
that
therefore,
the
tax
was
void.
nebraska
supreme
court
reversed
primarily
on
the
ground,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
property
was
a
purely
paper
interest.
the
united
states
didn't
really
own
the
property
and
that
therefore,
the
tax
could
be
justified
as
a
tax
in
the
lessee's
interest.
in
the
first
question,
i
want
to
touch
because
it
sort
of
underlie
the
theory
of
the
decision
below
is,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
united
states
or
the
petitioner
owns
the
property.
because
that
was
the
premise
upon
which
the
decision
below
rested.
now,
the
usual
rule
as
this
court
doubtless
knows
is
that
the
lessor
owns
buildings
constructed
on
leased
land
though
that
again
is
subject
to
the
intention
of
the
parties.
they
can
alter
that
by
contract
if
they
want
to.
but
here
the
parties
did
take
care
of
it
by
contract
but
instead
of
altering
the
usual
rule
they
made
perfectly
clear
that
the
buildings
were
to
belong
to
the
lessor,
the
government
as
they
were
built.
paragraph
11
of
the
lease
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
7
and
8
of
our
brief
provides
--
and
i
begin
on
page
8,
second
sentence
that
the
buildings
and
improvements
erected
by
the
lessee
shall
be
and
become
as
--
as
completed
real
estate
and
part
of
the
leased
lands
and
public
buildings
of
the
united
states.
and
the
prior
sentence
said
that
upon
the
expiration
of
the
lease,
the
building
shall
remain.
the
property
of
united
states
and
they
couldn't
remain
the
property
of
united
states
if
they've
never
been
the
property
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
primarily,
the
court
said
the
lease
is
for
75
years
and
there
were
some
testimony
that
it
wouldn't
be
economical
to
maintain
the
buildings
for
more
than
35
years
and
therefore,
they
said
it
was
a
fictitious
lease
adopted
just
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
taxes.
the
testimony
at
greater
length
of
the
--
the
--
there
was
other
testimony,
however
that
the
buildings
could
be
maintained
for
more
than
35
years
under
proper
conditions
and
maintenance.
i
think
if
you
put
all
that
together,
you
come
out
with
the
conclusion,
it
might
not
be
economical
for
a
businessman
to
do
so
but
the
building
could
last
longer
than
75
years
and
we
all
know
that
government
buildings
often
do
last
longer
than
they're
suppose
to,
from
our
experience
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
in
the
court
below
respondent
admitted
that
under
the
term,
as
i
read
their
briefs,
under
the
terms
of
the
lease,
the
government
was
the
owner
of
the
building,
they
purported
to
be
the
owner
of
the
building,
but
they
said
that
this
was
a
sham
and
a
fraud
for
the
reason
that
i've
indicated.
well,
if
it
is
a
sham
or
a
fraud,
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
the
fraud
or
our
client
because
these
was
all
done
in
a
government's
form
lease
but
we
think
it
obvious
that
there
wasn't
any
sham
or
fraud
to
it
even
if
the
purpose
of
shaping
the
contract
in
this
way
was
to
evade
or
not
to
evade
but
to
avoid
local
taxes.
that,
we
think,
is
immaterial
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
kern-limerick
case
in
347
u.s.
often
title
is
determined
by
contracts,
by
the
form
of
contracts.
and
if
property
rights
are
to
be
determined
by
contract,
the
contract
is
controlling
and
nonetheless
so
because
government
lawyers,
like
other
lawyers
perhaps
contracts
with
an
awareness
of
these
problems
and
with
a
purpose
to
do
what
they
think
will
be
in
the
best
interest
of
their
client.
but
we
think
the
--
apart
from
the
mere
language
of
the
contract
in
order
to
show
that
that
language
should
be
disregarded
or
the
other
side,
this
county
here
must
sustain
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
government's
interest
is
less
than
that
of
an
ordinary
lessor
who
conceivably
has
an
interest
in
the
--
in
property
and
its
interest
has
never
regarded
a
sham
or
fraudulent.
here
on
the
contrary,
it's
easy
to
see,
i
think,
from
the
facts
which
i've
outlined
that
the
government's
interest
in
this
property
is
greater
than
that
of
the
ordinary
lessor
--
lessor
because
the
ordinary
lessee
isn't
restricted
the
way
that
lessee
of
this
project
is
by
the
lessor.
the
most
important
that
the
bundles
of
--
bundle
of
rights
normally
vested
in
a
lessee
are
not
unrestricted
here.
they're
controlled
by
the
government.
the
ordinary
lessee
can
do
what
he
wants
with
the
property
that
he
leases
and
can
at
least
rent
it
or
for
what
he
chooses
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
economic
forces
and
make
as
much
money
as
he
wants
to.
that's
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
government
leased
to
petitioner.
the
government
leases
63
acres
of
land.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
and
--
and
--
on
the
land,
petitioner
built
buildings.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
at
its
own
expense,
not
well.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
they
borrowed
the
money
from
a
mortgagee
and
the
mortgage
is
insured
by
the
government.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
then,
however,
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
no,
the
lease
provides
that
as
the
buildings
were
completed
they
became
the
property
of
the
united
states
in
that
provision
i've
read
to
you,
i've
showed
you
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
--
well
that's
on
pages
7
and
8
of
our
brief
or
page
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
it's
in
138
of
the
record.
it's
the
same
--
it's
the
clause
11
of
the
lease.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
clause
11
of
the
lease.
so
that
--
since
the
buildings
became
the
property
of
the
united
states
as
they
became
completed,
they
became
subject
to
the
lease
just
to
the
land.
they
became
a
part
of
the
real
estate,
as
buildings
normally
do,
buildings
and
apartment
house
of
this
sort.
so,
they
were
leased
too,
the
buildings
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
buildings
cost
about
$5
million.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
land
was
land
on
an
airbase.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
it
doesn't
show
in
the
record
what
it
was
--
what
it
was
worth.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
government
doesn't
received
the
rent,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
receives
the
rent
but
the
government
fixes
--
government
fixes
the
rent.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
government
gets
a
hundred
dollars
a
year.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
$100
a
year
for
the
land
and
for
the
and
for
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
but
--
that
shows
that
there's
governmental
interest
in
this
thing.
the
government
wasn't
trying
to
make
money
out
of
this.
the
government
was
trying
to
have
a
project
built
to
serve
the
governmental
function
in
providing
housing
for
the
military
personnel
as
cheaply
as
possible
and
if
the
government
in
charge,
since
there's
rent
is
sort
of,
not
quite
but
it's
sort
of
cost-plus
basis
that
is
they've
got
to
fix
rent
which
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
no,
no.
the
government
allows
the
mortgage
--
allows
the
--
the
petitioner
to
charge
rents
which
it
hopes
unfortunately
for
our
client
hasn't
worked
that
way
but
it
hopes
to
allow
at
a
reasonable
profit
over
and
above
the
cost
of
the
project
including
the
amortization.
in
order
to
keep
the
rent
down
to
the
housing,
to
the
tenants,
they
don't
charge
more
than
the
nominal
rent
because
if
they
charge
much
more
than
a
$100
a
year
it
would
be
passed
on
to
the
tenants.
this
land
is
--
this
land
is
there
for
military
purposes.
it's
being
used
for
military
purposes
to
provide
housing
in
a
way
which
would
avoid
congress
having
to
put
up
a
few
billion
dollars
all
at
once.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
yes.
that's
--
that
--
the
government
right
from
the
beginning
established
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
yes.
that's
why
the
government
--
that
is
part
of
the
whole
picture.
the
government
fixes
the
rents
for
the
tenants.
it
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
it's
--
they
built
--
they
wouldn't
have
been
built
if
it
hadn't
been
for
government
financing.
there's
no
private
people
will
put
up
a
housing
on
these
military
reservations
without
government
leased
insurance
because
they
don't
know
for
sure
that
the
project,
that
the
--
that
the
government
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
no.
the
--
the
proposed
return
for
the
lessee
as
shown
by
the
project
analysis
is
about
$30,000
a
year,
maybe
$50,000.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
it's
not
6%
of
$5
million.
that
would
be
a
very
large
amount.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
it
--
that's
just
about
what
i
was
going
to
say,
your
honor.
in
substance,
the
petitioner
here
is
any
more
than
a
manager,
even
though
there
is
--
technically
there
is
leeway,
the
government
fixes
the
rent.
they
have
obligations
to
do
things
and
in
substance
the
same
as
a
management
fee.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
tax,
the
first
year
with
$10,000,
the
second
year
was
$15,000
and
there
hasn't
been
any
since
because
under
the
injunction
granted
below.
there
hasn't
--
there
haven't
been
allowed
to
grant
one
under
temporary
injunction.
what
i
was
about
to
say
is
that
the
--
most
important
rights
of
a
lessee
here
are
controlled
by
the
government.
he
can't
rent
to
whom
he
wants.
he
can't
charge
what
he
wants.
he
can't
use
the
property
for
what
he
wants
and
he
can't
even
make
the
length
of
a
sublease
of
what
he
wants
without
government
approval.
and
that
to
my
mind
shows
that
the
government
has
greater
control
over
this
project
than
an
ordinary
lessor
has
over
property
on
his
project
operated
by
an
ordinary
lessee.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
only
for
the
first
two
years
before
an
arrangement
was
made
as
the
--
the
record
shows
it
was
contemplated.
from
then
on,
it
would
be
passed
on
to
the
--
to
the
tenants.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
this
project
after
this
record
was
closed,
i
think
the
money
is
being
put
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
yes,
because
--
and
the
records
shows
in
the
project
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
right.
that's
why
the
government
is
really
interested
in
this
case
in
a
long
run,
in
this
whole
series
of
cases
more
than
the
property
on
this,
because
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
what?
mr.
robert
l.
stern
to
the
--
to
the
air
force
personnel.
that's
what
the
government
wants
to
avoid
but
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
provide
housing
for
these
people
that
is
low
cost
as
possible.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
not,
78%
completed,
your
honor,
according
to
the
record
and
the
rest
was
completed
within
a
couple
of
months.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
for
the
--
there
haven't
been
any
attempt.
they
make
something
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
to
each
building
--
yes,
but
that
means
each
building
has
completed
of
78%
of
the
buildings
were
fully
completed
according
to
the
record.
that's
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
wont
bother
with
the
record
references
but
78%
of
the
building
were
occupied
and
completed
by
that
time
and
for
future
years,
of
course,
a
100%
of
them
were
in
connection
--
may
i
refer,
your
honor,
to
record
164
the
very
last
couple
of
lines
in
the
project
analysis
which
says,
"if
such
taxes
are
assessed,
rents
will
have
to
be
adjusted
accordingly."
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i
don't
suppose
indirectly
but
not
directly.
it
wouldn't
work
that
way
directly.
i
won't
say
it
would
be
terrible,
your
honor,
i
supposed
the
--
the
salaries
of
people
in
the
air
force
probably
ought
to
be
increase
anyhow
to
keep
people
in
the
air
force.
but
the
--
but
the
record
indicates
and
what
we
all
know
that
rents
are
--
are
among
other
things
which
call
into
the
fact
that
rents
are
high
and
pay
is
low
are
among
the
various
factors
which
cause
people
to
leave
the
military
services
and
the
more
you
raise
the
rents
or
the
more
you
don't
raise
the
salary,
the
effect
is
going
to
drive
people
out
and
this
is
--
this
is
one
of
the
factors.
i
can't
--
i
can't
pin
it
down
to
say
that
salaries
would
go
up
to
$2
if
the
tax
were
$2
or
more
than
that.
in
short,
my
argument
on
this
question
of
who
owns
the
building
is,
the
lease
says
the
government
owns
them.
on
the
base
of
the
record
as
a
whole
the
government
has
more
control
than
the
ordinary
lessor,
the
lessee
has
less.
therefore,
you
can't
say
that
the
lease
is
fictitious.
the
buildings
performed
a
governmental
function
in
providing
military
housing
and
we
think
it
clear
that
the
buildings
are
government
property
and
the
tax
consequences
which
flow
from
that
must
flow
from
that
fact.
now,
i
am
going
to
move
to
the
--
to
the
argument
that
this
property
cannot
be
taxed
because
it's
on
land
over
which
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
whether
or
not
it
belongs
to
the
government,
whether
or
not
the
buildings
or
the
appliances
belong
to
the
government
or
belong
to
private
--
private
individuals.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
well,
that's
part
of
it,
if
--
if
this
is
--
if
this
area
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
if
the
united
states
hasn't
permitted
them
to
tax
to
what
lessee's
interest,
then
they
can't
because
you
can't
--
state
cannot
tax
any
property
unless
his
interest
is
a
kind
of
property.
a
land
on
which
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
without
the
consent
of
congress.
if
the
court
finds
the
congess
has
given
its
consent
under
the
lessee's
interest
statue,
to
which
i
will
come,
then
we
say
this
tax
isn't
on
the
lessee's
interest
because
it's
on
the
buildings
and
that's
not
the
lessees
interest.
that's
the
property
of
the
united
states.
those
are
the
two
main
problems
in
my
argument.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
furniture
and
fixtures
can't
be
tax,
your
honor,
for
--
for
either
one
or
two
reasons.
one,
because
it's
--
if
it's
on
an
exclusive
federal
enclave,
it
can't
be
taxed
unless
congress
has
consented.
two,
congress
has
to
consent
it
even
under
that
lessee's
interest
statute
because
those
--
those
appliances
haven't
been
leased
from
anybody.
they're
just
the
same
as
any
other
private
property
on
a
reservation
and
the
only
consent
which
anybody
refers
to
is
a
consent
to
tax
a
lessee's
interest
and
these
--
those
appliances
haven't
been
--
not
being
leased,
not
coming
under
any
lease
can't
be
called
a
lessee's
interest.
but
the
appliance
is
only
a
very
small
part
of
this
case
and
i
think
i've
summarized
my
argument
on
that
and
probably
won't
come
back
to
it.
now,
the
first
--
the
first
argument,
your
honor,
which
has
to
--
which
covers
the
point
of
lessee's
interest
as
well
as
anything
else,
is
that
this
cannot
--
this
tax
cannot
be
sustained
because
congress
has
not
consented
to
taxing
--
to
this
tax
on
lands
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it's
established
that
states
and
counties
cannot
tax
even
private
property
on
areas
over
which
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
in
the
surplus
trading
case
in
281
u.s.
there
were
blankets
own
by
a
private
company
on
a
military
reservation,
exclusive,
and
this
court
held
that
the
state
couldn't
impose
a
property
tax
on
them.
that
case
has
been
--
and
others
before
and
since
have
sustained
that
principle
and
there
hasn't
been
any
deviation
from
it.
the
--
some
of
those
case
involved
lease
property,
arlington
hotel
against
fant,
there
was
a
lease
for
50
years
of
--
of
land
on
a
reservation
for
50
years.
it
was
held
the
state
had
no
authority
over
it.
for
the
fact
that
the
lease
doesn't
make
any
difference.
now,
congress,
of
course,
may
waive
the
federal
immunity
from
taxation
and
it
is
done
so
in
a
number
statutes
which
used
expressed
language
saying
that
on
federal
areas,
certain
kind
of
taxes
or
other
laws
may
be
applicable.
most
important
here
is
the
buck
act
of
1940
which
permits
the
states
to
impose
sales,
used,
income
and
gasoline
taxes
on
these
areas
in
expressed
language.
but
it
doesn't
allow
him
to
impose
property
taxes
on
this
areas,
just
the
main
kind
of
taxes
and
it
does
so
very
expressly
which
shows
that
when
congress
want
to
this,
it
knows
how
to
do
it
expressly.
now,
there
is,
of
course,
special
reason
why
congress
should
have
to
be
quite
expressed
in
waiving
an
immunity
of
this
sort
and
that
is
because
people
and
states
and
the
federal
government
shouldn't
have
to
guess
as
to
where
the
jurisdiction
lies
over
--
over
particular
territory.
that
policy
was
embodied
in
an
act
1940,
involved
in
a
case
before
this
court,
adams
against
united
states
in
which
it
was
pointed
out
the
need
for
definiteness
in
accepting
jurisdiction
by
the
federal
government
over
these
areas
and
is
just
as
much
need
for
--
need
for
definiteness
in
--
in
losing
or
waiving
jurisdiction
as
there
is
in
accepting
it.
well,
now
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
the
congress
--
if
congress
means
to
waive
its
jurisdiction,
it
does
so
explicitly.
and
here,
as
i
am
going
to
show
you
in
most
of
the
rest
of
argument
it
hasn't
done
so
explicitly
and
we
do
extend
so
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
there
--
there
are
cases
which
hold
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
they
had
--
but
--
but
there
--
well
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
draftsmanship
was
ever
was
intended
to
reach
this,
your
honor,
as
i
will
show
you
in
the
next
few
minutes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
the
building.
what?
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
it's
in
the
record
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
--
the
property
was
mortgage
and
the
government
insured
the
mortgage.
i
don't
think
its
relevant
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
that's
the
leasehold
interest.
that's
everything
the
lessee
has
including
its
interest
in
the
building,
whatever
that
is,
not
the
title
of
the
building.
now,
let's
turn
to
the
statutes,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
--
and
the
question
here
we're
considering
is
whether
congress
has
waived
the
immunity
from
exemption
of
property
on
a
federal
--
exclusive
federal
area.
and
i
submit
that
no
one
reading
the
wherry
act,
would
ever
suspect
that
it
contained
any
such
waiver.
there
isn't
any
such
expressed
language
in
at
all.
the
only
legislative
history
which
even
refers
to
the
question
of
taxability
is
a
small
colloquy
in
the
committee
hearings,
set
forth
on
page
24
of
our
brief,
in
which
a
congressman
said,
if
they
were
bill
off
the
reservation,
the
housings
would
be
taxed.
nobody
contradicted
him.
the
administrator
was
there
and
i
think
that
shows
that
people,
if
--
if
they
thought
that
was
too
narrow,
they
would
have
said,
"well,
even
if
it's
on
the
reservation,
it
could
be
taxable,"
but
nobody
said
that.
so,
the
only
specific
mention
to
--
of
it
in
the
whole
history
of
this
bill
is
the
statement
--
if
it's
off
the
reservation,
it
can
be
taxed.
so,
let's
turn,
however,
to
sections
of
the
statute
which
maybe
regarded
as
pertinent
but
first,
i
want
to
refer
to
which
is
the
only
section
which
has
anything
to
do
with
taxation
at
all
quoted
in
page
25
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
section
80
--
no,
25
and
24,
section
807
and
that
provides
that
nothing
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
exempt
any
real
property
acquired
and
held
by
the
commissioner,"
that's
the
fha
from
local
taxation.
now,
let's
look
at
that
again,
"nothing
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
exempt."
this
mean,
this
title
shan't
exempt
and
the
reason
for
that
provision,
that
was
put
in
to
standard
provision
in
fh
--
various
titles
of
the
fha,
so
as
to
mean
that
if
the
fha
takes
over
property
under
fault.
that
property
won't
go
off
to
tax
growth.
so,
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
--
was
to
make
it
clear
that
the
property
which
was
otherwise
taxable
wouldn't
become
nontaxable
because
the
fha
acquired
it.
the
--
the
court
below
conceded
that
this
section
isn't
applicable
here
because
the
fha
haven't
acquired
this
property,
the
commission
hasn't
acquired
it
but
even
more
significantly,
this
section
is
significant
for
what
it
says
and
for
what
it
doesn't
say.
it
only
expresses
an
intention,
as
i've
said
that
property
which
is
taxable
otherwise
shall
stay
taxable
on
its
face.
it
doesn't
mean
or
provide
that
property
which
never
was
taxable
because
on
exclusive
federal
enclave
will
become
taxable
under
this
statute
and
that
--
if
i
may
--
that
if
i
may
say
so,
i
think,
there's
a
theme
underlying
my
--
this
portion
of
my
argument.
the
intention
was,
as
i
see
it
that
if
the
land
next
door,
just
like
this
land
is
taxable
as
it
would
be
or
off
to
reservation
then
the
project
should
be
taxable.
if
the
land
next
door,
50
feet
away
isn't
taxable.
if
the
building
next
door
wouldn't
be
taxable
because
it's
exempt,
then
this
project
shouldn't
be
taxable
and
i
think
that
make
sense
and
i
think
that's
what
congress
really
had
in
mind,
although
there
isn't
very
much
to
talk
about
it
as
--
as
i
have
indicated.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
commissioner,
no
--
the
commissioner
insures
the
mortgage
then
he
exercise
lots
of
controls
over
it
because
he
takes
the
preferred
stock.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
in
section
807.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
well,
that's
the
standard
provision
which
--
which
means
that
if
the
--
if
the
property
is
defaulted
under
fha
generally
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
no.
he
forecloses
it
then
he
gets
the
title.
they
didn't
want
that
to
go
off
to
tax
rules
but
if
it
never
was
on
the
tax
rules
because
it's
on
the
exclusive
reservation.
this
couldn't
be
applicable
and
that's
--
that's
the
only
specific
provision
the
statute
relating
to
taxes.
however,
the
court
below
relied
on
section
--
section
805
which
is
set
forth
at
page
63
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix
and
let's
look
at
that
section.
the
first
part
of
it
at
least
is
pretty
long
that's
the
most
relevant
part.
whenever
the
secretary
determines
that
it
is
desirable
to
lease
real
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
1947,
and
i'll
skip
a
little,
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
lease
such
property
under
authority
of
said
act.
that's
the
act
of
1947,
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
and
so
forth.
now,
there
--
there
again
nobody
reading
that
which
anything
in
it
about
taxation
or
--
or
any
intention
to
waive
--
to
waive
the
--
the
federal
immunity
but
let's
go
back
then
to
the
1947
act.
under
the
1947
act
which
is
set
forth
in
the
next
--
beginning
on
page
65,
a
little
further
on,
defines
section
1
of
that
statute
is
the
section
which
authorizes
the
secretary
to
lease
real
and
personal
property
under
certain
conditions
which
are
the
same
conditions
referred
to
in
the
1949
act.
now,
that
section
1
is
authorizing
section
of
the
1947
act.
there's
no
question
that
section
is
incorporated
by
reference,
if
you
want
to
call
that,
in
the
1949
act.
but
our
position
is
that
that
section
which
is
the
authorizing
section
is
the
only
part
of
the
1947
act
which
is
taken
over
to
the
1949
act.
that's
all
congress
was
thinking
about
when
they
said,
under
the
authority
of
said
act.
now,
if
you
look
the
next
four
sections
of
the
1947
act,
2,
3,
4,
and
5
in
the
next
couple
of
pages,
near
the
back
of
our
appendix,
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
these
subjects
who
obviously,
they
could
have
been
incorporated.
so,
the
whole
case
from
the
other
sides
point
of
view
comes
down
to
whether
the
first
section
of
sentence
of
--
first
sentence
of
section
6
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
68,
the
last
page
of
our
appendix
was
incorporated.
and
that
sentence
says,
that's
where
the
lessee's
interest
comes
in
your
honor,
it
says,
"the
lessee's
interest
made
or
created
pursuant
to
the
revisions
of
this
act
shall
be
made
subject
to
state
or
local
taxation."
our
first
--
our
position
on
that
is
that
that
was
not
intended
to
be
taken
over
under
the
very
general
language
of
the
1949
act.
no
one
in
the
1949
act
said
anything
about
immunity
from
taxation.
the
only
language
is
under
the
authority
of
that
act
and
we
don't
think
that's
expressed
enough
and
it
was
expressed
enough
indication
of
congressional
intention
to
be
a
waiver
of
immunity.
there
was
a
good
reason
for
not
carrying
--
for
congress
not
understanding
that
it
was
carrying
this
provision
over.
if
you
look
at
the
difference
and
purposes
of
the
two
statutes.
the
1947
act
was
the
statute
for
--
for
leasing
surplus
factory
facilities
to
private
industry
when
they
couldn't
be
used
by
the
government.
it
has
--
it
has
to
be
a
finding
that
the
land
is
of
no
--
that
the
plants
are
of
no
use
to
the
government
at
that
present
time.
and
if
that
so
--
of
course
there's
good
reason
why
the
lessee
at
--
we
should
--
in
them
should
be
taxed
that
this
leased
a
private
business
for
non-governmental
purpose.
here
the
purpose
was
just
the
opposite.
congress
is
providing
for
the
leasing
of
land
only
because
there
was
a
current
governmental
need
for
military
housing.
and
if
the
property
is
taxable
the
taxes
pro
tanto
to
some
extent
cut
into
the
governmental
purpose
providing
housing
at
its
lower
price
as
possible
for
the
military
personnel.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
if
it
--
if
section
6
applies
the
lessee
originally
pays
the
--
can
be
required
to
pay
a
tax
on
the
lessee's
interest
but
not
upon
the
whole
value
of
the
property
which
it
doesn't
own.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
then
it
would
be
passed
on
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
not
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
if
the
--
this
is
none
of
the
renegotiation
clause
but
if
--
if
any
kind
of
a
property
tax
is
imposed,
the
fha
on
--
will
take
that
into
account
in
determining
the
maximum
rents
and
if
the
lessee
has
to
pay
taxes
which
it
was
assumed
in
the
original
or
when
the
rents
originally
fix,
he
didn't
have
to
pay.
they
have
agreed
it's
the
general
understanding,
it
isn't
in
the
lease
but
that's
the
way
it
works
and
the
way
it's
been
done
generally.
they
will
raise
the
rents
and
proportion
them
up.
it
isn't
in
the
--
under
the
renegotiation
clause
in
section
6
itself
because
that's
said
the
government's
rent
maybe
reduced.
that's
only
$100
a
year
and
that's
really
inapplicable
here
because
that's
only
a
nominal
rent
anyhow.
it
works
another
way.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that
says
--
that's
the
lease
to
the
government
--
from
the
government.
that's
not
the
lease
to
the
lessee's.
any
lease
of
property
authorized
under
the
provision
of
this
act.
that's
the
lease
by
the
government
shall
contain
a
provision
that
if
in
the
extent
such
property
is
made
taxable.
now,
you
note
here,
the
contrast
between
such
property
and
the
lessee's
interest.
the
first
sentence
allows
the
tax
and
the
lessee's
interest
and
this
relates
to
the
government's
property.
and
here,
as
i
shall
show
or
maybe
i
have
shown
about
the
tax
was
imposed
in
the
buildings
and
the
buildings
of
the
government's
property.
so
even
--
my
--
my
second
argument,
your
honor
as
i've
said
it,
even
if
this
is
applicable,
they
haven't
come
--
come
within
it
because
they
didn't
tax
the
lessee
--
they
tax
the
government's
property.
well,
one
more
observation
on
section
6
before
i
try
to
do
draw
this
to
a
conclusion.
the
history
of
section
6
itself
shows,
in
our
opinion,
that
it
wasn't
intended
to
apply
to
exclusive
federal
enclaves.
without
going
into
detail
orally
because
that's
a
little
difficult,
it
shows
that
it
was
thought
by
the
framers
that
lessee's
interest
of
what
was
involved
in
the
1947
act,
the
appliance,
the
factories
could
be
taxed
anyhow
by
states
which
permitted
them
to
be
taxed
and
it
is
common
law
and
is
common
law
of
this
court
that
lessee's
interest
generally
can
be
tax
if
they
are
in
the
state
of
california.
so,
in
the
committee
which
this
provision
was
drafted,
some
people
said,
"well,
you
don't
need
something
in
the
statute
to
allow
taxation
of
this,"
and
others
said,
"well,
it
won't
do
any
harm
to
put
it
in.
it'll
be
the
substance,
it'll
be
declaratory
anyhow."
so,
they
put
it
in.
now,
that
full
discussion
doesn't
make
sense
at
all
if
they
were
talking
about
exclusive
federal
areas
because
in
exclusive
federal
areas,
states
can't
tax
lessee's
interest.
they
must
have
been
talking
on
the
--
on
the
--
basing
this
or
writing
on
the
assumption
they're
talking
about
lands
which
could
be
taxed
otherwise
and
that
wouldn't
be
an
exclusive
federal
area.
well,
now
let's
look
at
the
--
theirs
is
--
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
section
6
itself
doesn't
apply
to
such
areas,
that
it
wasn't
intended
to
be
incorporated
in
the
1949
act,
anyhow
but
that
statute
isn't
specific
enough.
but
let's
look
at
the
a
anomalous
consequences
which
would
result
if
the
other
conclusion
is
reached.
on
a
military
base
like
this,
right
next
door,
hundred
yards
away,
in
this
although
this
isn't
in
the
record,
this
isn't
a
fictitious
example.
there
could
be
government
owned
apartment
houses
with
appliances
owned
by
private
individuals.
there
could
be
a
government
owned
building
with
a
private
contractor
and
owning
his
own
machinery
and
that
actually
is
the
case
to
some
extent
right
on
this
project,
a
hundred
yards
away
from
these
apartments.
this
privately
owned
machinery,
the
privately
owned
appliances
couldn't
be
taxed.
right
on
the
land
this
project
is
on.
the
tenants
owned
their
own
property.
the
utility
companies
owned
their
own
property.
they
can't
be
taxed,
they
are
not
lessee's
interest
of
any
sort,
they're
just
private
property
on
a
government
reservation,
just
like
that,
just
as
if
they
were
located
50
yards
away
of
course
across
right
outside
of
the
leased
land.
they
couldn't
be
taxed.
it
certainly
would
be
strange
for
congress
to
intend
that
government
leased
--
property
of
the
government
could
be
taxed
or
property
leased
from
the
government
could
be
tax
when
property,
which
is
privately
owned
or
leased
from
a
private
person
right
next
door
couldn't
be
taxed.
that
just
doesn't
make
sense
and
i
don't
think
that
statute
should
be
construed
so
as
to
reach
that
result.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
it's
a
government
enclave,
yes.
they
--
they're
going
to
argue
at
the
20
acres
of
this.
they
don't
say
its
20
acres
but
a
part
of
it
only
is
20
acres
isn't
subject
to
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
both
courts
below
disagreed
with
that
and
i
don't
intend
to
take
time
on
that
orally.
that's
considered
in
our
briefs.
in
conclusion
on
this
point
therefore,
we
believe
that
in
order
to
avoid
this
anomaly
and
in
order
to
reach
the
result
which
i
think
is
the
one
which
--
which
provides
a
standard
which
should
be
applied
in
these
cases
that
this
project
should
be
tax
just
like
the
land
next
door.
it
should
be
tax
if
the
fellow
next
door
can
be
taxed
and
it
shouldn't
be
taxed
if
the
fellow
next
door
can't
taxed.
and
here
the
fellow
the
next
door
couldn't
be
taxed,
its
unexclusive
federal
enclave.
in
order
to
avoid
the
unjust
result,
whereby
this
county
collects
taxes
for
services
which
it
doesn't
provide
where
they're
provided
mainly
by
the
federal
government,
this
tax
cannot
stand.
and
i
add
that
the
district
court
for
sarpy
county
said
they
wouldn't
be
any
lost
to
sarpy
county
if
that
result
will
reach
because
this
property
had
never
been
on
the
tax
growth
of
sarpy
county.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
the
federal
housing
act,
is
an
amendment
of
the
fha,
is
titled
--
it
was
title
8
of
the
fha.
the
military
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
fha
is
the
housing
act,
the
national
housing
act
or
the
federal
housing
act,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
it's
a
new
title
for
military
housing
in
the
--
in
title
12
which
has
to
do
with
the
--
which
has
to
do
with
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
only
through
that
one
little
clause
which
i
mentioned,
where
it
said
you
could
lease
under
the
authority
of
the
act
of
1947
--
the
only
time.
we
don't
think
that's
enough
for
tying
--
to
bring
in
tax
immunity.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
wherry
act
of
section
--
says
--
in
section
805
is
that
the
clause
i
mentioned,
that's
all
it
says
in
effect.
the
wherry
act
of
807,
which
i
also
referred
to.
now,
i
think
i've
given
the
substance
of
our
argument
that
this
tax
can't
stand
in
any
event
because
it
isn't
in
the
lessee's
interest
but
on
the
property
of
united
states
and
i
just
want
to
refer
to
one
case.
this
maybe
the
one
case
i
--
one
other
case
i
referred
to
in
this
course
of
my
argument,
the
allegheny
county
case
in
322
u.s.
we
submit
is
directly
in
point
on
that
proposition.
in
the
allegheny
county
case,
there
was
a
lease
by
the
government
of
machinery
to
a
private
company
and
the
allegheny
county
there
taxed
the
full
value
of
the
machinery
leased
by
the
government
to
the
private
company.
this
court
held
that
that
was
tax
on
the
government's
own
--
government
own
machinery
and
was
void,
couldn't
stand.
and
in
the
--
in
the
course
of
it's
opinion
the
court
pointed
out
that
maybe
the
lessee
there,
domestic
company,
possessed
a
leasehold
interest
in
this
machinery.
but
the
court
said
nobody
has
tried
to
tax
the
leasehold
interest.
there
hasn't
any
effort
to
segregate
the
leasehold
sold
interest.
therefore,
we
aren't
concern
with
that,
this
is
a
tax
from
the
government's
property
and
it
is
void
and
can't
stand.
and
we
think
that's
precisely
the
situation
here
if
you
assume
that
section
6
of
the
1947
statute
is
applicable
and
that
a
tax
on
the
lessee's
interest
can
be
imposed.
i
think
i'll
reserved
the
remainder
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
may
it
please
the
court.
i
guess
i'd
better
answer
the
last
question
first.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
value
of
the
lessee's
interest
because
nobody
made
any
attempt
to
valuate
a
lessee's
interest
or
no
one
ever
claimed
that
the
lessee's
interest
was
being
taxed
until
you
got
up
into
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
worthless,
your
honor,
but
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
it's
worth
--
it
answers
justice
black's
contention,
we
say,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
it's
worth
anything
like
the
value
of
the
buildings
because
to
put
it
briefly,
nobody
in
his
right
mind
would
pay
for
these
buildings
under
this
lease
subject
to
all
the
restrictions
that
are
on
them.
the
most
important
which
is
you
can't
charge
what
you
want
for
them,
what
he
would
pay
there
for
those
same
buildings
fee
simple
absolute
title.
now,
we
think
the
mater
case,
since
--
since
there
was
no
attempt
to
segregate
a
lessee's
interest,
the
master
case
is
controlling
because
there,
there
was
a
leasehold
interest
in
master
and
the
tax
was
on
the
value
of
the
machinery
and
the
court
said
there
wasn't
any
attempt
to
tax
the
--
to
segregate
the
lessee's
interest
and
the
tax
is
void
because
it's
on
the
physical
property.
and
here
my
adversaries
are
very
candid
and
stating
what
is
the
obvious
fact
from
the
record
in
the
forms
of
the
testimony
that
they
are
trying
to
tax
the
buildings
and
nothing
but
the
building.
now
your
honor
asked
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i'm
not
sure
if
that
pennsylvania
whether,
it
was
--
it
was
on
machinery
which
pennsylvania
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i
think
pennsylvania
law
--
under
pennsylvania
law,
i
think
it
was
the
other
way
around.
i
think
it
was
part
of
the
realty.
they've
tried
to
tax
it
to
the
landowner,
the
machinery,
but
this
court
said
who
owns
the
machinery
is
a
federal
question.
the
government
owns
the
machinery,
united
states
and
pennsylvania
law
isn't
controlling
as
to
that.
this
tax,
which
is
based
on
the
valuation
of
the
machinery,
is
based
on
the
valuation
of
government
property
and
pennsylvania
can't
tax
that.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
and
they
--
and
they
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
government
property
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
they
don't
concede
that
it's
a
government
property
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
incidence
of
the
tax--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
they
don't
concede
that
it's
government
property,
they
concede
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
the
lease
makes
it
government
property.
under
the
lease,
the
buildings
are
part
of
the
real
estate.
the
lease
was
a
government
contract.
the
intention
was
to
make
sure
that
the
buildings
are
government
property
as
they
were
completed
and
by
all
indicia,
they
are
government
property.
now,
the
only
argument
which
is
made
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
all
right.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
let
me
address
myself
to
that.
first
of
all,
to
clear
one
piece
of
deadwood
away
as
far
as
the
constitutional
questions
are
concerned,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
call
it
realty
or
personally
as
your
honor
implied.
secondly,
if
you
assume
there
--
remember
we
have
two
points
here.
if
you
assume
that
this
whole
project
is
not
exempt
because
it's
on
a
federal
on
claim,
that
was
my
first
argument.
i
spent
most
of
the
other
day
on
that.
i
won't
get
back
to
that
very
much
today.
if
you
assume
that
--
if
that
--
we're
not
wholly
exempt
because
of
that,
then
offutt
as
a
lessee
has
a
lessee's
interest
which
under
that
--
under
that
1947
statute
or
if
you
assume
it
is
not
unclear
which
it
is,
without
the
1947
statute,
the
lessee's
interest
could
be
taxed
if
anybody
had
valuated
a
lessee's
interest
and
taxed
it,
but
that
hasn't
been
done
in
this
case.
i
commend
to
your
honor
that
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
who
was
very
close
to
this--that's
the
nebraska
state
court.
he
said
i
know
of
such
finding
that
they
could
or
couldn't
have
taxed
a
lessee's
interest,
nobody
has
tried
to
tax
one.
i
don't
know
how
to
evaluate
it,
there
isn't
any
evidence
on
that.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
if
--
if
it
gets
back
to
the
second
point,
if
the
time
hasn't
expired,
nebraska
could
assess
a
leasehold
interest.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
that
depends
on
the
local
law.
up
to
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
there
ever
has
been
any
--
there's
no
nebraska
case
indicating
how
they
assess
leasehold
interest.
as
mr.
entenman
pointed
out
on
these
public
school
lands,
the
buildings
are
owned
by
the
lessee
as
--
and
not
by
the
lessors
or
the
problem
has
not
ever
risen.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
it
can
be
--
it
can
be,
but
in
this
case,
it
certainly
isn't
anyway
as
near
as
valuable
as
a
fee
because
of
the
controls
apart
from
other
things
because
of
the
control
which
the
government
puts
on
this,
this
is
a
government
project
primarily.
the
government
initiated
it,
started
it,
supervised
it,
and
they
used
this
petitioner
largely
as
a
manager
of
the
buildings.
now
they
say
that
--
that
this
is
worth
$5
million.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
trust
put
up
the
money
but
the
government
had
to
insure
the
mortgage
the
government
bears
the
risk
not
the
manufacturer's
trust
company.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
sir
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
well
certainly
by
--
this
is
a
continuing
suit.
certainly
by
1953,
they
were
all
completed.
the
record
shows
and
it's
discussed
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
in
1952
and
1953
and
the
future,
it's
an
injunction
suit
in
part.
for
1952,
78%
were
completed
by
the
tax
day
at
least
and
the
people
are
living
in
it.
now,
without
regard
for
the
rest,
they
were
completed
and
the
title
was
passed
to
them
by
march
10th,
that's
admitted
in
the
record.
i
--
i
don't
understand
mr.
entenman.
he
said
the
whole
thing
isn't
completed
but
buildings
are
completed,
there
are
great
many
buildings,
they're
completed
as
they
move
along.
and
now
i
think
i've
said
and
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
whether
the
government
has
any
beneficial
interest
here
or
rather
in
contrary,
whether
all
the
beneficial
interest
was
in
--
was
in
the
petitioner.
and
we
think
first
of
all
an
ordinary
lessor
has
a
beneficial
interest.
it's
always
been
assumed
that
an
ordinary
lessor
has
a
beneficial
interest.
the
government
here
as
i
said
the
other
day
has
a
greater
interest
in
the
ordinary
lessor
because
it
controls
practically
everything
that's
done
with
this
project
which
an
ordinary
lessor
can't
do.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
but
the
controls
are
exercised
through
--
through
the
list,
your
honor
in
large
part
as
well
as
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well
but
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no
but
this
its
financial
interest
--
financial
interest
comes
from
insurance
of
the
mortgage
and
also
from
its
interest
in
what
its
military
subtenants
have
to
pay.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
well
i'd
like
to
address
myself
i
can't
--
i
have
agreed
that
if
this
is
not
treated
as
wholly
exempt
because
it's
in
an
enclave
and
interest
could
have
been
taxed
if
any
attempt
has
been
made
to
tax
it.
but
the
cases,
the
sra
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case
and
others
where
there
was
a
fair
legal
title
in
the
government
and
the
full
beneficial
ownership
was
in
somebody
else.
it
was
a
conditional
sale
on
the
sra
case
but
here,
none
of
those
cases
were
leases
in
which
the
government
had
the
same
interest
as
an
ordinary
lessee
--
lessor
or
more.
and
that
i
think
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
you
don't
tax
an
ordinary
lessee
for
the
value
of
the
property.
even
without
these
things
i'm
talking
about,
the
fact
that
the
rent
is
low
doesn't
make
any
difference,
the
rent
is
low
to
serve
a
governmental
purpose.
and
that
shows
that
the
government
is
more
interested
in
this
project
not
that
it's
less
interested.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh
well,
i
do
--
i
do
want
to
make
one
other
observation
and
it's
probably
isn't
unnecessary.
whether
this
is
--
whether
this
is
realty
or
personally
or
something
like
that
could
depend
upon
nebraska
law.
whether
this
property
is
owned
by
the
united
states
or
not,
whether
the
lease
is
controlling,
that
doesn't
depend
upon
the
nebraska
law.
that's
federal.
that's
a
question
for
this
court
to
decide.
and
the
nebraska
decision
certainly
isn't
controlling
as
to
whether
this
property
belongs
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
can't
reargue
all
of
what
i
covered
the
other
day,
your
honor,
as
--
as
to
the
enclave
point.
i
would
suggest
however,
that
--
that
my
suggestion
there
that
congress
intended
in
this
statute
that
government
property
or
rather
that
the
lease
property
should
be
treated
the
same
as
the
lease
property
next
door
should
be
treated,
should
be
taxed
no
more
and
not
--
and
not
any
less
is
an
accurate
reflection
of
congressional
intention.
that
would
mean
that
if
you
were
in
an
enclave
entirely
private
property,
it
could
all
be
taxed
and
the
lessor
or
the
lessee
would
make
any
difference.
if
--
if
it
were
an
area
where
the
united
states
did
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
of
the
case
and
many
of
the
reservation
in
california,
and
you're
in
a
state
where
they
tax
the
leasehold
interest
as
california
and
some
other
states
then
you
can
tax
the
lessees
interest
even
without
the
1947
statute.
if
that
was
declared
in
his
legislative
history,
just
to
be
declaratory
what
the
law
on
those
states
would
be
anyhow.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you're
on
an
exclusive
area
where
the
property
next
door
couldn't
be
taxed
if
it
were
privately
owned,
then
we
don't
think
congress
would
have
intended
this
kind
of
project
to
be
taxed
by
a
local
government
which
doesn't
furnish
any
services
for
it
and
would
thereby
be
requiring
the
military
tenants
to
pay
double
--
to
pay
taxes
for
what
they
weren't
benefiting
for
and
to
what
they
actually
were
paying
for
in
another
way.
now
i
don't
think
that
section
6
is
clear
enough
if
you
follow
it
through
how
it
came
in
to
the
statute
and
everything
if
its
clear
enough
that,
that
was
intended
to
apply
to
an
enclave.
to
conclude
that
it
was,
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
find
one
that
congress
realize
they
were
incorporating
section
6
and
not
just
section
1
when
they
wrote
the
1949
statute.
of
course,
the
other
conditions
they
were
referring
to
were
all
in
section
1,
2,
3,
4
and
5
as
i
said.
they
clearly
weren't
incorporated.
then
you
have
to
assume
congress
believed
and
knew
that
section
6
applied
to
enclaves.
and
the
history
of
it
indicates
that
the
congressman
there
couldn't
have
thought
that
it
did
or
what
they
said
when
they
drafted
it,
senator
tydings,
secretary
penny,
and
secretary
royal
didn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
you
got
to
put
both
of
those
things
together
before
you
can
find
that
it
applies
--
it
applies
to
an
enclave.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
in
part,
it's
a
new
grant
of
authority
as
far
as
the
leasing
is
concerned,
they
referred
back
to
the
1947
act
and
removed
some
of
the
conditions
in
section
1
of
that
act.
it
also
grant
the
secretary
new
power
to
certify
to
the
fha
that
this
project
should
be
insured
and
is
necessary
and
the
fha
goes
along
insures
it
pretty
much
as
a
matter
of
course.
you
see
previously
the
fha
wouldn't
lend
unless
they
thought
it
was
a
good
commercial
project.
now
for
military
basis,
as
we
all
know,
sometimes
they're
abandoned
and
nobody
would
put
his
money
into
a
thing
like
that
unless
the
government
would
underwrite
the
project.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
it
is
the
latter,
your
honor,
except
that
i
think
it
only
refers
to
section
1
of
the
1947,
that's
all
they
meant
the
authorizing
part
of
the
1947
act
but
it
is
the
latter.
and
now
in
1955,
as
our
briefs
indicate,
they
amended
it
again
and
took
out
the
reference
of
the
1947
act
for
the
future,
not
to
these
projects,
for
future
projects,
but
that
indicates
that
congress
really
isn't
when
it
--
when
all
this
litigation
is
coming
along
and
certainly
to
some
extent
was
in
the
public
eye
that
from
now
on,
they
aren't
--
don't
want
any
of
these
new
projects
in
the
future
to
be
taxed.
they
took
up
the
reference
of
the
1947
act
and
from
then
on,
nothing
on
an
enclave
can
be
taxed
at
all.
thank
you,
your
honor.
