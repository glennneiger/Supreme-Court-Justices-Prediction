unknown
speaker
is
the
assessment
there
ready?
unknown
speaker
what
was
--
what
was
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
this
is
what
the
assessor
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see
household
appliances
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
do
they
lease
for
the
government?
unknown
speaker
and
nothing
else.
unknown
speaker
as
its
own
expense.
unknown
speaker
and
if
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
that
its
own
expense.
unknown
speaker
and
it
agreed
that
the
end
of
the
time
--
unknown
speaker
where
--
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
on
page
33,
i'm
looking
at
this
record.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
what
you've
talked
before.
unknown
speaker
the
rent.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
as
liable
to
increase
of
the
rent.
unknown
speaker
when
the
first
assessment
was
made
the
entire
construction
611
units
have
been
completed?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
looked
at
it
on
the
count
of
138
says
that
the
building
improvements
only
become
a
part
of
the
lease
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
on
a
completion
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
furniture
and
fixtures.
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
about
the
--
of
the
$5
million
mortgage
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
$5
million
mortgage
to
the
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
that
involved
with
this?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
just
for
personal
property
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
commission
have
to
do
with
this?
he'd
made
to
him?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
speaking
of
--
of
any
real
property
acquired
and
held
by
the
federal
housing
commission.
unknown
speaker
that's
because
it's
the
government
enclave?
unknown
speaker
wherry
--
wherry
housing
act,
a
part
of
the
amendment
to
the
military
leasing
act?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
amendment
of
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
to
military
leasing
act
of
1947.
unknown
speaker
so,
wherry
act
says
that?
unknown
speaker
you
claim
the
united
states
doesn't
own
a
property.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
--
suppose
we
will
decide
that
a
property
was
owned
by
the
government,
would
you
have
a
different
conclusion
there?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me.
unknown
speaker
well
have
you
--
have
you
taxed
the
leasehold
interest
here?
unknown
speaker
you've
taxed
only
the
improvements.
unknown
speaker
--
the
improvements
--
unknown
speaker
so
those
buildings
are
--
are
the
property
of
the
government
who
have
no
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
your
last
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well
i've
always
understood
the
billing
build
upon
the
land
is
part
of
the
land.
is
there
something
in
the
contract
or
circumstance
of
this
case
that
severed
these
buildings
on
the
land
and
make
some
chapters
or
make
some
--
some
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
does
that
make
them
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
does
that
make
them
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
i
was
to
build
upon
the
99-year
leases
and
outlive
the
lease
but
i
always
understood
it's
part
of
the
land.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
--
how
many
years
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that's
section
11
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
difference
between
the
two
cases.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you're
going
to
comment
to
section
11
later.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
s.r.a.
case
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
brief
would
say
--
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
the
--
it
was
a
lower
court
finding?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
guarantee
of
the
mortgage
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
--
wasn't
it
more
than
an
extend?
what
was
the
language
of
the
act
in
directing
or
i
what
is
the
direction?
unknown
speaker
well
there's
--
there's
a
difference
between
an
authorization
and
a
correction.
it
was
the
--
it
was
merely
to
give
the
federal
housing
administration
the
power
to
insure?
unknown
speaker
or
was
it
a
direction
that
they
should
ensure
when
asked
to
do
so
by
the
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
nothing
but
authority.
unknown
speaker
no
indication.
unknown
speaker
and
--
and
they
had
that
certification
of
course.
unknown
speaker
under
those
circumstances,
they
were
compelled
to
insure?
unknown
speaker
now
(inaudible)
whether
or
not
the
government
has
a
responsibility
over
and
above
the
parties
of
the
land
or
whether
they
weren't
making
sure
that
the
money
that
was
put
into
it
would
in
turn
against
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
it
is
--
in
nebraska
mr.
entenman,
if
you
own
a
house
and
lot
--
unknown
speaker
--
distant
to
me,
who
would
have
to
pay
the
taxes?
unknown
speaker
that
--
that's
a
special
statute.
unknown
speaker
--
relating
to
the
public
land.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
apply
--
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
situation.
unknown
speaker
what
limit
it
to
the
state
public
land?
unknown
speaker
any
--
any
land
belonging
to--
unknown
speaker
--
the
governmental
body.
unknown
speaker
where
--
where
is
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
about
renegotiations
--
unknown
speaker
--
of
the
lease?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
pay
--
you
have
it
--
precise
works
in
front
of
them
but
they
have
it,
they
have
to
pay
any
tax
to
the
state
on
this
property.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stern.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
you
yesterday
--
the
other
day,
your
view
as
you're
arguing
this
case,
i
understood
you
to
--
to
assert
that
--
that
these
--
these
properties
were
completed.
these
houses
were
completed
and
therefore,
under
section
11,
had
become
the
property
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
what
years
were
involved?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
