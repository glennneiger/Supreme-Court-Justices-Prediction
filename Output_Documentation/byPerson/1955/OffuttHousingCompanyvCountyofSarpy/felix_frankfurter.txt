so
the

for

no.
but
did
you
found
the

what
was
the

(inaudible)
justice

if
the

would
be
paid
by

would
have
come
out
of

you
called
(inaudible)

--
probably
with
the
consent
of
the

justice

what

on
to

is
a
matter
of

--

(inaudible)

is
there
any
suggestion
that
the

have
another

another
aspect
of

that
if

have

justice

--
that
sort?
justice

that
could
easily
avoided
by

--
justice

the
trouble
is,
there
is
still
left
with
escapable
from
(inaudible)
justice

one
of
--
one
of
many,
many,
many
cases
trouble
the
court
before
congress
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
found
a
little
(inaudible)
in
mere
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
petitioner
carried
to
my
view,
that
if
the
petitioner
is
nebraska
could
not
pass
the
leasehold,
meeting
the
value
of
the
lease
as
personal
property
which
i
take
it
nebraska
(inaudible)
leasehold
personal
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
us
what
you
say
--
that
you
reject
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they,
what
is
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
lease
--
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
i
would
like
to
have
your
view
on
this.
suppose
without
any
of
this
--
without
bothering
by
form
and
substance,
suppose
i
were
to
conclude
that
--
that
offutt
is
a
lessee
in
the
ordinary
conventional
sense
terms,
is
it
your
position
if
nebraska
could
or
couldn't
show
the
wherry
act
taxed
the
words
of
that
--
that
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
leads
to
--
to
an
asset
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
certainly
--
the
power
to
class
--
the
choice
in
classifying
whether
it's
to
be
treated
as
realty
or
personal
is
for
the
state
in
which
the
property
is
and
therefore
it
cannot
turn
on
whether
nebraska
regardless
if
the
person
would
be
real
--
perhaps
it's
really
in
with
this
--
this
interest
whatever
you
label
which
offutt
company
has
in
this
effort.
it's
something
that
nebraska
can
tax
in
view
of
its
relation
to
governmental
immunities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
why
--
why
are
you
--
why
does
it
seem
important
to
you
for
you
to
differentiate
your
ground
of
support
from
what
one
reads
or
at
least
(inaudible)
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
nebraska
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course
if
somebody
who
has
an
interest
to
a
property
for
a
thousand
years
for
practical
purposes
has
dominion
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
you
mean?
or
you
mean
something
more
esoteric
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
can
understand
that
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
adams,
is
this
interest
is
that
the
neutral
enough
words
that
this
monetary
value
that
belonged
to
the
offutt
in
relation
to
this
building.
is
that
(inaudible)
with
the
consent
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
lease.
so
that
he
got
something
of
value.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
(voice
overlap)
is
whatever
label
nebraska
depends
on,
whatever
the
common
law
you
maybe
as
to
what
a
leasehold
is.
whether
that
something
in
which
you
can
get
money
tomorrow
on
the
air
force
or
whatever
(inaudible)
whether
that's
taxable
thing.
does
it
make
any
difference
what
(inaudible)
you
based
on
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
dont
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
official
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
is
--
what
page
is
that?
(inaudible)
--
all
right
what
is
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
831?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
petitions
then
to
that
application
of
constructive
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
yours
but
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
renegotiated
to
cover
both
the
taxation
of
what
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
going
to
happen
to
the
maryland
case
that
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
but
the
failure
of
the
government
to
seek
review
and
to
determine
the
legal
question
but
i'm
curious
to
know
what
did
happen
to
that
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happened
after
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
of
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
maryland
case
had
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
that
--
is
that
the
reason
you
have
with
the
chief
justice's
question
as
today,
namely,
that
under
your
--
under
nebraska's
tax
system,
this
must
come
within
the
nebraska
court's
personal
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
doesn't
come
within
the
nebraska
court's
personal
property,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
this
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
matter
of
nebraska
and
that's
why
--
that's
why
i
gather
in
the
chief
justice's
question
that
you
must
hold
this
is
personal
property
not
within
the
limit
of
the
federal
constitution
with
the
power
vested
to
do
what
he
did.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
nebraska
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
law
determines
what
its
taxes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
question
is
whether
that
determination
collide
with
anything
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
constitutes
and
says
you
can
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
position
wouldn't
be
any
different,
would
it,
if
nebraska
regarded
this
as
real
property
and
good
estate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
--
and
it
was
taxed
to
the
real
estate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
(voice
overlap)
this
very
estate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
nebraska
regard
the
leasehold
as
real
property
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
both
common
law
statutes
probably
exactly
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
label
--
label
determination
for
nebraska.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
collision
problem
which
is
for
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
entenman,
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this
at
the
core
of
phrase
of
the
word
of
chief
justice
just
a
minute
ago.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
and
perhaps
mr.
stern
can
do
it
when
he
gets
on
(inaudible).
is
it
oversimplifying
this
case
on
one
aspect
by
assuming
that
nebraska
neither
used
realty
of
person
but
taxed
an
interest
whatever
interest
offutt
company
may
have.
it's
just
the
meaning
of
the
word
interest
that
chief
justice
said
two
minutes
ago,
would
the
case
is
always
a
simplifying
case
from
the
point
of
view
of
power,
the
question
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
though
neither
of
you
could
be
here
arguing
the
title,
leasehold,
personal
property,
realty,
but
nearly
argued
whether
a
there
wasn't
interest
which
b
nebraska
could
tax
in
the
light
of
the
government's
relation
to
the
end
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
--
then
there
would
be
no
other
results
so
to
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
must
accept
--
we
must
accept
what
nebraska
said
that
this
in
each
view
is
personal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
none
of
our
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
provided
only
that
it
may
be
nominated
with
the
taxable
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
money
--
money
amount
of
the
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
sheds
any
light
as
to
the
value
of
this
interest,
whatever
it
maybe,
the
value
of
the
interest
in
case
the
offutt
company
ask
the
permission
of
the
government
to
assign
it
to
some
other
eager
investor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
not
to
infer
that
it's
worthless,
are
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
before
you
move
on,
the
master
case,
to
check
my
recollection,
the
master
case
attached
was
sought
to
be
imposed
on
what
by
common
law
notice
would
have
been
deemed
part
of
the
realty,
but
in
pennsylvania
it
was
thought
to
be
deemed
prior
to
the
person,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
pennsylvania
law,
i
mean
anybody
else
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
because
of
the
incident
of
the
tax
fall
on
what
was
conceded
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
government
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
well
the
incidence
of
the
tax
here
fall
on
what
is
considered
the
government
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
bother
about
it.
(inaudible)
no
matter
what
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
tax
here
fall
on
something
that
it's
a
government
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
bother
about
their
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
forget
about
that.
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
a
property
hasn't
got
an
assessable
interest
in
the
lease
transferrable
with
the
consent
of
the
government
which
is
an
interest
apart
from
anything
that
the
government
cares
about
and
should
care
about
and
is
therefore
taxed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
of
that
if
we
do
not
accept
your
first
point,
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
accept
it
(inaudible)
then
as
to
your
second
point,
the
utmost
you
can
ask
is
the
case
be
sent
back
for
proper
evaluation
for
this
whole
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
interest,
whatever
--
whatever
they
call
them
as
a
local
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you've
had
cases
only
very
recently
of
this
court
which
make
my
(inaudible)
assume
of
the
lease,
the
leasehold
interest
maybe
very
valuable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
maybe
a
--
they
have
control
without
having
monetary
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
--
i
repeat
that
although
that
finding
hold
on
the
lessee
and
yet
not
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
it
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
mere
fact
that
it
has
an
interest,
doesn't
preclude
taxing
the
interest
of
the
--
the
other
interest
and
the
(inaudible)
case
is
conclusive
adjudication
on
that.
