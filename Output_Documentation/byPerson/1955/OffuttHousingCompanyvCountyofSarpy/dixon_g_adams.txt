mr.
dixon
g.
adams
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
first,
that
congress
has
consented
to
this
tax.
and
that
in
so
doing,
congress
has
waived
any
immunity
that
might
result
from
exclusive
jurisdiction.
secondly,
this
tax
was
not
imposed
upon
any
property
or
interest
in
property
of
the
united
states,
and
only
the
property
of
the
offutt
housing
company,
the
petitioner
has
been
taxed.
now
we
rely
upon
a
flat
consent
by
congress
to
this
taxation
in
the
--
the
legislation
under
which
this
project
was
constructed.
the
list
and
i
referred
to
page
132
of
the
record.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it
is
printed
at
page
24
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice,
a
particular
language
in
section
6
of
the
act
of
august
5th,
1947,
the
second
paragraph
on
page
24.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
section
6.
now
the
lease
recites
as
follows.
witnesses,
that
under
the
authority
of
the
act
of
august
5th,
1947,
10
u.s.c.
1270
and
the
act
of
august
8,
1949
public
law
211
81st
congress,
and
goes
on
to
lease
63
acres
of
bare
land
to
the
petitioner
here
for
a
consideration
of
$100
per
year.
now
the
wherry
act
was
not
a
leasing
act.
it
was
an
amendment
to
the
national
housing
act
and
it
extended
the
provisions
of
the
national
housing
act
to
this
type
of
rental
housing,
but
it
gave
no
new
authority
to
lease.
the
congress
looked
to
its
prior
authority
which
was
contained
in
the
act
of
august
5th,
1947,
which
is
set
out
on
this
first
section
which
is
set
out
on
page
22
of
the
appendix
in
our
brief.
this
was
a
general
military
leasing
act.
now
the
leases
made
under
the
authority
of
the
1947
act
were
generally
limited
to
a
term
of
five
years,
and
they
were
also
cancelable
in
the
event
of
a
national
emergency.
and
this,
of
course,
would
not
work
under
the
wherry
act
because
it
made
profits
impelled
profits
and
made
financing
very
difficult.
so
these
provisions,
these
limitations
were
removed
in
the
wherry
act
in
section
805
of
the
wherry
act.
but
the
wherry
act
itself
in
section
805
which
is
setout
at
page
26
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
recites,
'whenever
the
secretary
of
the
army,
navy,
or
air
force
determines
that
it
is
desirable
to
lease
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
august
5th,
1947
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
this
title,
the
secretary
concerned
is
authorized
to
lease
such
property
under
the
authority
of
said
act.
and
that
goes
on
to
say
that
the
two
limitations
as
to
duration
and
as
to
cancellation
in
the
event
of
a
national
emergency
should
not
apply.
the
rest
of
the
act
of
august
5th,
1947
was
not
disturbed.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
section
6
was
incorporated
and
that
the
consent
of
taxation
applies
to
this
property.
now
this
consent
was
the
basis
for
decision
in
all
of
the
cases
decided
by
appellate
courts
both
state
and
federal,
which
have
passed
upon
the
consent
proposition
in
wherry
act
cases.
the
first
such
case
was
meade
heights,
incorporated,
versus
state
tax
commission
of
maryland
decided
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
there
as
here,
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
land.
the
distinction
in
the
maryland
case,
meade
heights
case,
was
that
the
least
involved
purported
or
vested
title
in
the
lessee
title
to
the
improvements.
here,
the
lease
purports
to
vest
title
to
the
improvements
of
the
united
states.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
have
taxed
it
as
personal
property.
we
taxed
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
don't
contend
that
we've
taxed
the
lease
hold
interest.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
claim
that
the
petitioner
owns
a
property
and
we
will
demonstrate
that.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
if
this
court
decided
that
the
property
was
owned
by
the
government,
i
would
say
that
the
most
we
could
tax
would
be
the
leasehold
interest.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
most
that
we
could
tax
would
be
the
leasehold
interest.
but
in
the
meade
heights
case,
the
court
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
have
not
taxed
--
we've
taxed
it
as
personal
property.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
buildings
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
--
and
the
other
personal
property
which
is
admittedly
the
appliances.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
that's
right.
if
they
belong
to
the
government,
but
they
don't
belong
to
the
government
unless
four
meters
to
control
on
the
substance.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
--
we
submit
that
these
buildings
do
not
belong
to
the
government,
they
belong
to
the
petitioner.
now,
the
court
in
the
meade
heights
case
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
yes,
sir.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
surely.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
well
as
i
read
your
honor,
the
nebraska
court's
opinion,
a
leasehold
in
nebraska
is
taxable
as
personal
property.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
that
is
the
way
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
no.
i
--
i
don't
reject
that
except
that
i
say
we
taxed
them
as
personal
property.
we
don't
want
to
make
any
playing
that
we
tax
the
leaseholder,
we
tax
them
as
improvements
upon
leased
lands.
but
we
think
they
belong
to
the
petitioners
so
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
buildings.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
buildings.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
think
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i'd
like
to
answer
it
this
way.if
you
should
conclude
that
what
the
petitioner
has
is
a
leasehold
interest,
i
still
think
we
can
tax
it.
because
nebraska
--
the
nebraska
opinion
at
page
206
are
being
said
that
in
nebraska,
a
leasehold
is
classified
as
personal
property.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
that's
right
and
whether
or
not
any
interest
of
the
government
is
actually
being
taxed
by
--
i
mean
that
is
why
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i'm
not
trying
to
make
any
distinction.
i
merely
go
into
that
because
the
title
here,
the
paper
title
to
these
things
is
--
is
in
the
united
states
under
the
lease.
so
i
do
think
it's
important
that
the
court
recognized
it
in
substance,
these
buildings
are
the
property.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
that's
right.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
no,
i
think
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
there
--
there's
this.
that
the
--
the
evidence,
the
record
will
show
that
these
buildings
will
never
outlast
the
terms
of
the
lease,
that
they're
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
is
it
what?
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
believe
it
makes,
it
makes
some
personal
property,
yes.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
--
we
believe
that
what
our
court
was
saying
is
that
here,
the
entire
beneficial
interest
to
this
property
is
in
the
lessee
and
that
you
can
tax
it
as
personal
property.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
yes,
under
the
lease.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
oh
yes,
he
has.
he
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
don't
think
so.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
think
they
have
something
(voice
overlap)
of
value
as
demonstrated
by
the
fact.
the
mortgage
that
they
have
for
almost
$5
million.
now
the
meade
heights
case
found
that
there
was
consent
by
congress
to
this
taxation.
and
just
in
passing,
i'd
like
to
say
that
counsel
said
that
he
was
happy
to
see
that
the
solicitor
general
is
still
on
his
side,
but
i
note
from
the
opinion
of
the
meade
heights
case
that
the
solicitor
general
who
i
believe
is
the
same
gentlemen
was
at
that
time
the
chief
justice
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
he
found
that
there
was
consent.
he
now
urges
the
other
way.
the
next
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
next
wherry
act
case
to
which
i
would
like
to
refer
is
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
fort
dix
apartments
corporation
against
borough
of
wrightstown.
again,
land
where
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
that
case
involved
both
types
of
leases,
one,
which
vested
the
title
to
the
improvements
in
the
lessee
and
another
which
purported
to
vest
title
in
united
states.
and
the
new
jersey
court
in
a
decision
which
one
judge
said
and
held
that
they
were
subject
to
taxation
by
new
jersey.
conley
housing
corporation
against
coleman,
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
held
to
the
same
effect
that
there
was
a
consent
here,
and
there
the
titled
was
vested
in
the
lessee.
dayton
development
fort
hamilton
corporation
against
boylan,
the
new
york
supreme
court
case
held
in
the
same
effect.
there
is
an
error
in
the
citation
of
that
in
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae,
the
correct
citation
is
133
new
york
supp.2d,
page
831
rather
than
820.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
brief
in
the
amicus
for
grant
county
or
washington.
the
change
should
be
in
the
page
number,
it
should
be
831.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
correct
citation
is
dayton
development
fort
hamilton
corporation.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it
should
be
831.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
page
8
(voice
overlap).
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
now
those
are
the
--
and
of
course
this
--
this
case
including
this
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska's
opinion
and
the
only
cases
which
have
passed
upon
this
question
of
consent
and
they
only
have
found
that
the
congress
consented
to
this
taxation.
there
is
a
virginia
decision
cited
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner
but
there
the
court
didn't
pass
upon
the
question
of
consent.
they
merely
said
that
this
is
a
leasehold
interest
and
virginia
doesn't
have
a
statute
which
will
reach
the
interest.
so
they
didn't
pass
on
the
question
of
consent.
now
the
petitioner
argues
that
section
6
of
the
1947
act
is
not
applicable
to
leases
made
under
the
1949
act,
the
wherry
act,
and
that
the
very
reference
in
the
wherry
act
to
the
1947
act
isn't
sufficient.
but
congress
must
have
reviewed
the
1947
act
when
they
removed
these
two
limitations
as
to
length
of
lease
and
the
cancellation
in
the
event
of
the
national
emergency
and
they
could
have
said
that
section
6
is
not
to
apply
but
they
didn't
--
so
we
submit
that
if
it
did.
in
another
way,
there
is
an
indication
here
that
section
6
of
the
1947
act
applies
to
leases
made
under
the
wherry
act.
the
court
will
note
that
section
6
contains
two
sentences.
the
first
is
the
lessee's
interest
made
or
created
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
made
subject
to
state
or
local
taxation,
that's
the
first
sentence.
the
second
sentence
says
any
lease
of
property
authorized
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
contain
a
provision
that
if
and
to
the
extent
that
such
property
is
made
taxable
by
state
and
local
governments
by
act
of
congress.
in
such
event,
terms
of
such
lease
shall
be
renegotiated.
those
two
sentences
are
section
6
of
the
1947
act.
then
looking
at
the
lease
involved
at
page
137
of
the
record,
paragraph
8
of
the
lease,
which
deals
with
taxes,
the
court
will
note
that
there
are
also
two
sentences
in
that
paragraph
for
the
lease.
the
first
one
provides
that
the
lessee
shall
pay
to
the
proper
authority
when
as
the
same
become
due
and
payable,
all
taxes,
assessments
and
similar
charges
which
at
anytime
during
the
term
of
this
lease
maybe
taxed,
assessed
or
imposed
upon
the
government
or
upon
the
lessee
with
respect
to
or
upon
the
lease
premises.
the
second
sentence
provides
in
the
event
any
taxes,
assessments
or
similar
charges
are
imposed
with
the
consent
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
upon
the
property
owned
by
the
government
and
included
in
this
lease.
as
opposed
to
the
leasehold
interest
of
the
lessee,
therein,
this
lease
shall
be
renegotiated.
so
we
submit
that
the
government
itself
and
the
government
prepared
this
lease
recognized
that
section
6
would
apply
to
leases
under
the
wherry
act.
and
so
they
complied
with
the
statutory
mandate
and
included
that
provision
in
their
lease
and
they
cannot
now
be
heard
to
say
that
section
6
doesn't
apply
to
wherry
act
leases.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
our
construction
of
that
paragraph
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
well
i
--
i
think
they
mean
that
--
that
there's
--
if
there's
anything
here
in
this
--
i
don't
think
they've
answered
this
question
--
my
contention
there.
it
never
answered
that.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
--
i
think
their
position
to
be
that
they
say
well
congress
has
never
consented
to
the
taxation
of
anything
but
if
it
should
then
this
lease
shall
be
renegotiated.
but
do
we
submit
that
that
can't
be,
what
would
be
--
there's
$100
a
year
rental
to
the
government,
what
would
be
the
sense
of
renegotiating
that?
the
lease
--
under
this
provision,
the
lease
they
could
renegotiate
would
be
half
of
it
or
$50
a
year.
so
--
so
it
doesn't
make
sense.
now
our
construction
of
section
6
is
this.
that
the
first
sentence
refers
to
the
property
owned
by
the
lessee
and
here
that's
the
buildings
and
the
other
personal
property.
and
the
second
sentence
in
section
6
refers
to
the
land,
and,
of
course,
we
haven't
taxed
the
land,
but
the
land
clearly
belongs
to
the
government.
now
should
the
government
consent
to
the
taxation
of
the
land,
this
lease
would
be
renegotiated.
as
to
the
improvements,
there
already
have
been
consents.
the
maryland
court
said,
as
we
read
this
provision
it's
called
for
renegotiation
only
in
the
event
that
congress
should
consent
to
taxation
of
the
government's
interest
in
addition
to
that
of
the
lessee,
which
is
recognized
as
fully
taxable
as
of
the
date
of
execution.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
government
intervened.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it
was
not
appealed.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
march
13th,
1953.
i
understand
from
the
petitioner's
brief
that
they
were
seeking
certiorari
in
the
fort
dix
case
but
that's
where
my
information
functions.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
no.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
that's
right.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
--
i
think
the
lease
involved
was
the
same
with
the
exception
of
--
in
the
maryland
lease,
the
lease
purported
or
vested
title
to
the
improvements
in
the
lessee.
and
here
they
change
the
form
of
lease
to
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
that's
right.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
that's
right.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
yes,
sir.
we
plan
to
comment
on
that
quite
extensively.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
yes.
now,
so
that's
where
we
--
we
rely
for
express
consent.
but
we
--
we
say
that
in
two
ways,
congress
has
consented
to
this
tax
by
implication.
first
of
all,
there
is
section
807
of
the
wherry
act
which
is
setout
on
page
26
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
and
which
provides
as
follows.
nothing
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
exempt
any
real
property
acquired
and
held
by
the
commissioner
under
this
title
from
taxation
by
any
state
or
political
subdivision
thereof
to
the
same
extent
according
to
its
value
as
other
real
property
is
taxed.
now
we
don't
say
that
that
is
a
direct
consent
but
we
do
say
that
the
inclusion
of
this
section
by
congress
would
appear
to
evidence
and
intent
or
an
indication
that
congress
intended
that
this
property
should
be
treated
the
same
as
any
other
property
insured
by
on
which
the
federal
housing
commission
insured
the
mortgage,
it
shouldn't
be
put
on
any
other
basis.
that's
the
only
construction
of
it
that
we
can
make.
this
was
the
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
--
we
think
it
was
--
it
was
an
indication
that
congress
intended
that
this
property
should
be
treated
the
same
as
any
other
property
on
which
there
was
an
fha
insured
mortgage.
now
the
district
court
in
new
jersey
decided
the
case
for
the
demurral
there
the
municipality
under
this
section.
and
the
district
court
there
said
that,
certainly,
a
private
corporation
like
the
petitioner
shouldn't
be
preferred
to
the
commissioner.
but
we
don't
say
that
this
is
a
direct
consent
of
taxation,
but
we
say
it's
an
implied
consent
to
taxation.
now,
in
the
third
way,
we
say
there's
consent
by
implication.
this
is
a
lease
for
75
years
to
a
private
corporation.
and
it
was
authorized
by
congress
and
congress
in
section
805
of
the
wherry
act
set
no
term,
no
length
of
time
on
this
lease,
presumably
this
could
be
a
lease
for
150
or
200
years.
that
the
same
section
also
gave
the
secretaries
power
to
sell
the
property.
and
we
believe
that
such
a
statute
as
that
impliedly
waves
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
impliedly
consents
to
this
tax.
and
as
authority
for
that,
we've
cited
the
case
of
s.r.a.
versus
minnesota
decided
by
this
court
which
involved
property
over
which
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
it
was
sold
as
authorized
by
congress
under
an
executory
contract
of
sale.
a
legal
title
remaining
in
the
united
states.
and
the
s.r.a.
incorporated
there
contended
that
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
you
couldn't
tax
anything
over
which
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction,
but
the
court
there
announced
what
it
called
the
rule
of
necessity
and
said
that
certainly
the
unrestricted
transfer
of
this
property
waived
any
--
any
such
claim
that
the
united
states
still
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
we
believe
that
a
--
a
lease
of
this
type
for
75
years
to
a
private
profit
seeking
corporation
brings
at
somewhere
close
to
the
rule
of
this
court
as
announced
in
s.r.a.
against
minnesota.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it
was
an
--
there
had
been
no
date.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it
was
an
executory
contract
sale
--
initial
sale.
now
the
petitioner
relies
quite
strongly
upon
surplus
trading
versus
cook.
but
we
think
it's
distinguishable,
there
was
no
lease
involved
and
there
was
absolutely
no
question
of
consent
by
congress.
now
as
to
who
owns
the
buildings,
the
petitioner
here
confuses
title
the
abstract
concept
title
with
beneficial
ownership
and
here
the
entire
beneficial
ownership
is
in
the
petitioner.
clause
11
of
the
lease
purports
to
vest
title
in
the
united
states,
that's
the
clause
that
--
that's
on
page
138.
the
petitioner
suggests
in
its
brief
that
--
that
the
army
used
the
old
form
and
the
air
force
didn't
but
the
moses
lake
case
indicates
that
the
air
force
did
the
same
thing
when
they
first
started
making
leases
under
the
wherry
act,
they
vested
title
to
the
improvements
in
the
lessee.
and
when
it
appeared
that
these
units
were
going
to
be
assessed,
they
changed
the
form
of
the
lease
and
read
--
in
moses
lake
they
actually
presume
to
modify
the
lease
retroactively
to
vest
title
to
the
improvements
of
the
government.
but
that's
the
form,
that's
the
paper.
the
substance
is
this.
and
that,
first
of
all,
it
was
never
the
intention
of
congress
that
title
to
this
building
should
be
in
the
united
states
and
any
reading
of
the
debates
in
congress
for
instance
our
brief
at
page
16
will
indicate
that
congress
understood
that
title
to
these
things
as
to
be
on
the
lessees.
mr.
manoli
said
it's
a
strictly
private
enterprise
building
which
probably
construction
is
moved
out
and
the
whole
matter
is
turned
over
to
private
enterprise.
and
mr.
johnson
said,
i'm
reading
down
toward
the
bottom.
in
other
words
we
propose
to
have
contractors
build
houses
on
military
installations
and
pay
the
rental
allowance
provided
by
law
for
service
personnel
in
form
of
rent
to
the
contractor
so
that
in
30
years,
the
house
will
be
paid
out.
when
the
installments
have
been
paid
out
to
the
contractors,
the
house
and
land
become
the
property
of
the
government
not
before
but
after
and
other
indications
in
the
debates
in
the
committee
are
the
same.
senator
capehart
said,
there
possibly
should
be
a
provision
that
if
the
base
abandoned
and
the
houses
are
there
without
military
tenants,
the
owners
would
be
permitted
to
rent
them
to
civilians
or
sell
them.
that's
at
page
41
of
the
senate
hearings.
now,
the
building
is
here
have
a
usual
life
of
less
than
the
term
of
the
lease.
and
i
would
like
to
read
the
testimony
on
that
subject
at
page
108
of
the
record.
this
is
the
president
of
the
petitioner
corporation
testifying.
mr.
wilson
question
-
"how
long
have
you
been
engaged
in
the
building
and
rental
of
houses
in
that
business?"
answer
-
"42
years."
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
108,
your
honor.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
about
the
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
question
-
"now
from
your
experience
then,
with
the
construction
of
houses,
and
the
building
and
renting
of
houses,
what
would
be
the
expectancy
of
these
units
that
were
constructed
at
off
the
field."
answer
-
"we
are
thinking
rather
go
along
with
the
f.h.a.
and
the
mortgage
folks,
we
put
a
35-year
life
on
these
buildings."
and
on
page
113,
the
petitioner's
counsel
tried
to
qualify
that,
and
he
said.
question
-
"you
testified
that
the
life
of
these
buildings
were
estimated
to
be
35
years
did
you
not?"
answer
-
"i
did."
based
upon
your
experience
these
buildings
with
proper
maintenance
when
repaired
this
type
of
construction
for
these
buildings
be
maintained
and
referred
to
have
a
longevity
in
excess
of
the
term
of
the
lease.
answer
-
"yes
they
could."
question
-
"would
you
deem
it
profitable
throughout
the
housing
company
to
maintain
them
and
refer
them
so
that
their
longevity
will
exceed
the
term
of
the
lease?"
answer
-
"do
you
mean
the
term
of
the
75-year
lease?"
question
-
"yes
sir."
answer
-
"i
have
always
considered
that
any
building
that
was
75
years
old
was
not
worth
maintaining
any
prior
than
that.
so
that's
all
the
testimony
that
's
in
this
record
on
useful
life
of
these
buildings,
and
we
submit
that
at
the
end
of
this
lease,
there
won't
be
anything
left
for
the
government
to
inherit."
now,
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
nebraska
supreme
court?
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
but
if
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
there's
a
finding
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court's
opinion,
yes
sir.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
don't
believe
there's
a
lower
court
finding,
is
there?
i'll
have
that
checked
to
see
if
we
could
(inaudible).
now
the
petitioner
has
here
a
75-year
lease
for
which
it
pays
$100
a
year.
it
has
the
right
to
possession
for
75
years
and
the
right
to
all
profits
out
of
this
project
for
75
years.
the
petitioner
mortgage
of
its
interest
which
it
now
claimed
a
worth
little
or
nothing
to
manufacturer's
trust
company
of
new
york
for
almost
$5
million.
and
in
this
mortgage
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
170,
it
mortgaged
three
things.
it
mortgages
leasehold
interest
in
the
land,
it
mortgaged
of
the
buildings
and
improvements,
and
it
mortgaged
its
other
personal
property
on
the
lease
premises.
it
also
worn
to
its
title
to
these
things
in
the
mortgage,
that's
on
record
171.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
171.
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page
it
says
the
intention
being
to
convey
hereby
an
absolute
title
and
be
simple
including
all
rights
homestead
and
other
rights
and
interest
as
aforesaid.
now,
at
another
point
in
the
mortgage,
record
176,
it's
provided
that
all
awards
of
damages
in
connection
with
any
condemnation
for
public
use
of
or
injury
to
any
of
the
said
property
are
hereby
signed
and
shall
be
paid
to
the
mortgagee.
so
if
the
property
is
condemned,
the
manufacturers
trust
company
gets
the
award.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
say
it
retained
none.
the
petitioner
argues
that
its
these
restrictions
on
the
lease
in
the
form
of
right
to
designate
subtenants
with
certain
exceptions.
the
right
to
control
rentals,
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it's
a
restriction
of
a
type
but
we
don't
think
it
detracts
it
in
the
lease
from
the
value
of
the
petitioner's
interest
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
might
make
it
more
valuable
because
the
government
is
practically
guaranteeing
100%
occupancy
of
these
buildings.
now
if
the
government
fails
to
designate
a
tenant
within
30
days
under
paragraph
3
of
this
lease,
then
the
petitioner
can
rent
to
anybody,
any
civilian.
there's
no
military
connection.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
we
don't
find
any
that
they
can
get
it
back
for
75
years.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
they
can
condemn
it.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
yes.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
but
they'd
have
to
pay
for
it.
and
the
prior
--
the
condemnation
award
would
be
split
between
the
mortgagee
and
the
lessee
here
based
upon
their
respect.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
full
value
as
we
read
the
--
possibly
not
the
land
but
certainly
the
buildings.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
as
we
read
the
lease.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
believe
that
the
rent
would
be
the
same.
there's
a
provision
in
the
lease
that
after
the
f.h.a.
mortgage
is
paid
off
from
then
on
the
rents
are
to
be
agreed
upon
between
the
government
and
the
housing
company,
but
in
any
event
they
can't
be
less
than
they
were
before.
but,
i
think
that
the
civilian
tenants
would
probably
receive
the
same
rentals.
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
indication
one
way
or
another.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it's
in
paragraph
3
of
the
lease
at
page
134.
generally,
if
the
commanding
officer
fails
to
designate
military
or
civilian
personnel
of
the
army,
navy,
marine
corps
or
air
force
to
whom
the
unit
or
units
shall
be
leased
within
30
days
after
receipt
of
written
notice
from
the
lessee
that
such
unit
or
units
are
available
for
lease
then
they
can
go
ahead
--
they
can
go
ahead
and
rent
it
to
civilians.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
yes.
it
could
be
rented
to
someone
with
no
military
connection.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record
reflects
that
one
way
or
another.
there's
no
provision
in
the
lease
that
requires.
i
don't
think
that
the
rentals
would
be
the
same.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
the
f.h.a.,
federal
housing
administration
insured
the
mortgage
but
of
course
the
petitioner
pays
the
same
premium
for
that,
i
would
pay
mortgage
on
my
house.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
well
the
specific
purpose
of
the
wherry
act,
your
honor,
was
to
extend
these
mortgage
insurance
provisions
to
this
type
of
rental
houses,
but
the
premium
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
of
the
national
housing
act
to
military
rental
houses.
prior
to
this
time
apparently,
it
had
been
difficult
or
impossible
for
f.h.a.
to
insure
this
type
of
loan
because
there
was
too
much
risk
involved.
the
congress
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
well
the
wherry
act
itself
--
it
was
an
authorization
to
extend
the
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
yes.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
it
extend
--
it
gave
them
the
authority
to
it.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
well,
on
a
certification
by
the
secretary
of
the
department
concerned
that
there
was
no
--
and
that
this
was
a
permanent
base
and
that
there
was
no
indication
of
that
--
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
--
activities
would
be
curtailed,
i
guess.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
they
did.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
don't
want
to
say
one
way
or
another
whether
they
were
compelled
to
but
at
least
they
did.
they
did
insure
the
mortgage.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
housing
administration
acts
in
any
different
capacity
here
than
it
does
on
any
--
any
other
loan.
another
indication
of
ownership
here
is
the
fact
that
the
hazard
insurance,
the
proceeds
of
the
hazard
of
insurance
are
payable
to
the
lessee
and
the
security
holder.
that's
also
provided
by
the
lease
and
the
mortgage.
in
other
words
if
the
building
is
burned
down,
the
lessee
and
the
security
holder
can
split
up
the
insurance
money
and
the
government
gets
nothing.
so
that
we
think
that's
another
indication
that
the
petitioner
actually
owns
the
buildings
and
improvements.
the
cases
we
have
examined
have
held
that
their
title
in
the
united
states
does
not
prevent
taxation
of
the
whole
value
of
property
to
the
equitable
owner.
the
petitioner
relies
upon
the
united
states
against
allegheny
county
but
we
distinguish
that
case
which
is
commonly
called
the
master
case.
and
that
here
we're
not
trying
to
tax
any
government
property.
there,
pennsylvania
was
trying
to
tax
the
property
of
the
government
by
calling
it
the
property
of
master,
at
least
that's
what
the
court
said.
but
here,
the
government
owns
no
property
and
these
things
that
they
rely
on
as
government
interest
in
this
thing
are
really
not
government
interest
at
all.
the
court
in
the
master
case
said
that
we're
a
private
interest
in
government
property
are
so
preponderant
that
all
the
--
the
government
has
the
naked
title
then
the
whole
value
is
taxable
to
the
equitable
owner.
and
the
conditional
sales
cases
like
s.r.a.
against
minnesota
and
new
brunswick
against
united
states
were
to
the
same
effect,
that
the
bare
legal
title
in
the
government
doesn't
prevent
the
taxation
of
the
property
to
its
equitable
owner.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
outside
the
lease.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
no.
no,
there
is
a
distinction.
they
don't
reserve
the
right
normally
under
an
f.h.a.
mortgage
to
determine
the
rental.
mr.
dixon
g.
adams
well,
i
believe
so,
but
they
do
--
they
do
prescribe
the
rentals
here.
but
we
--
we
think
this,
that
these
rentals
while,
of
course,
congress
hope
to
hold
them
down
are
necessarily
based
upon
what
the
amortize
cost
of
the
project
is.
in
other
words,
the
rentals
had
to
be
enough
to
amortize
the
--
the
loan
and
--
and
allow
a
reasonable
profit
to
this
lessee
or
he
never
would
enter
into
the
transaction.
so
that's
--
that's
what
the
rentals
are
based
upon.
in
concluding
my
part
of
this
argument
and
i
will
turn
part
of
it
over
to
mr.
entenman,
my
colleague
here.
i
just
like
to
say
that
the
--
the
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
states
could
reserve
the
rights
for
instance
to
execute
civil
and
criminal
process
upon
these
--
these
reservations.
to
the
end
that
the
reservation
wouldn't
become
a
refuge
or
sanctuary
for
completely
private
personal
property
that
had
no
other
basis
for
immunity
other
than
its
mere
location
upon
the
land.
and
we
believe
that
this
is
specially
true,
this
place
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
become
a
sanctuary
for
private
property
and
this
is
specially
true
where
congress
has
spoken
as
clearly
and
it's
expressly
as
it
has
here
that
this
property
should
in
any
event
be
subject
to
taxation.
