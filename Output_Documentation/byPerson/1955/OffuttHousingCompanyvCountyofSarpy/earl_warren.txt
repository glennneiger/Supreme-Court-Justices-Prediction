mr.
stern,
before
you
get
to
that,
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
question
as
to
whether
they
can
tax
the
lessee's
interest
in
the
land?
chief

if

if

could

in
the
event
this

some
of

rented
to

it
must
--
do
they
get
the
benefits

chief

what
would
happen
if

do
you
consider

do
you
consider
it
necessary
to
--
to
hold
that
this
property
is
personal
property
owned
by
the
lessee
in
order
to
sustain
your

if

now,
i'm
going
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
entenman,
do
i
understand
you
then
that
if
this
court
should
conclude
that
those
houses
are
real
property,
and
the
ownership
is
in
the
united
states
that
there's
nothing
we
could
do
here
to
help
you
notwithstanding
the
way
we
have
sovereign
immunity
in
the
--
in
the
1947
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
understood
you
to
say
though
that
under
nebraska
law,
the
ownership
of
those
houses
must
be
in
the
lessee
and
that
they
must
be
considered
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
personal
property
in
order
for
you
to
have
the
right
to
--
to
tax
--
tax
them
under
nebraska
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
get
at
whether
you
--
whether
you
relied
entirely
of
ownership
of
the
--
of
the
property
by
the
lessee
as
a
personal
property
or
whether
--
whether
you
could
consider
the
--
the
interest
of
the
lessee--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
of
the
property
as
--
as
the
lessee.

chief

but
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
1949
act,
a
new
grant
of
authority
to
the
--
to
the
secretary
to
do
these
things
or
is
it
--
is
it
merely
an
enlargement
of
his
rights
under
--
under
the
1947
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
i
mean
is
this.
is
this
a
--
a
new
grant
of
authority
or
is
this
just
enlarging
the
provisions
of
the
1947
act
giving
the
government
the
right
to
--
to
lease
in
accordance
with
that
act
with
the
exception
of
the
two
limitations
that
it
placed
on
it,
namely,
the
length
of
the
lease
and
one
other
which
escape
from
me
at
the
moment.
