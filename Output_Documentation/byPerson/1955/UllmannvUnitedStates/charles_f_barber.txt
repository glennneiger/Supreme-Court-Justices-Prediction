mr.
charles
f.
barber
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
petitioner's
argument
that
no
immunity
statute
could
be
valid
under
the
fifth
amendment.
that
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
provides
a
privilege
of
absolute
silence.
in
the
latter
part
of
my
argument,
i
will
address
myself
to
its
more
particular
objections
to
this
statute.
i'm
going
to
stand
back
just
a
moment
and
look
into
the
past.
petitioner
has
asked
this
court
to
rethink
constitutional
doctrine
that
requires
as
i
think
to
take
a
short
look
at
the
rules
of
that
doctrine.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
the
accommodation
to
be
made
between
two
principles
of
equal
dignity,
both
to
be
preserved
which
are
here
in
conflict.
petitioner's
dealt
wholly
with
one
of
this,
the
principle
in
which
in
our
law
has
constitutional
sanction
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
that
there
may
be
no
doubt
about
it.
that
we
embrace
that
principle
in
words
which
are
recently
had
been
cited
by
this
court
as
one
of
the
great
landmarks
and
men
struggled
to
be
free.
the
competing
principle
is
at
equal
dignity,
and
stands
at
the
foundation
of
justice
under
law.
that
is
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
every
man's
testimony
we
find
evidence
that
this
principle
is
the
more
ancient
in
the
declaration
of
sir
francis
bacon
then
the
king's
attorney
general
in
the
account
of
(inaudible)
case,
which
was
at
trial
for
contempt,
for
refusal
to
answer
questions
put
by
the
house
of
lords.
all
subjects
declared
by
sir
francis
owe
to
the
king,
tribute
and
service,
not
only
of
their
hand
indeed,
but
also
with
their
witness
and
discovery,
whether
it
be
of
their
own
fact
or
another's.
when
two
such
fundamental
principles
come
in
conflict,
the
usual
judicial
method
is
to
seek
for
an
accommodation.
when
these
two
principles
presented
themselves
in
conflict
in
the
aaron
burr
trial
and
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
privileges
applied
to
willie,
aaron
burr's
secretary,
chief
justice
marshall
at
the
onset
observed
that
the
principle
which
entitles
the
united
states
to
every
man's
testimony,
and
the
principle
by
which
every
witness
is
privileged
not
to
accuse
himself
can
neither
of
them
be
entirely
disregarded.
in
the
immunity
act
of
1954,
congress
has
worked
out
an
accommodation
between
these
principles.
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
wisdom
of
that
act.
that
was
seriously,
ponderously
debated
in
congress.
our
question
here
is
this.
has
congress
made
an
allowable
judgment,
allowable
under
our
constitution?
i
rely
heavily
on
history
for
the
entire
tradition
of
anglo-american
law
from
the
earliest
times
to
the
present,
not
including
the
--
not
excluding
the
formulation
of
the
constitution
itself
and
without
significant
precedent
to
the
contrary,
teaches
that
this
sort
of
accommodation
is
a
lawful
and
permissible
one.
the
--
the
tradition
of
granting
immunity
from
prosecution
in
exchange
for
testimony
has
roots,
definite
precedents
nearly
as
old
as
the
precedents
which
we
rely
on
to
show
the
emergence
of
the
privilege
itself.
thus,
in
1725,
we
find
the
british
parliament
enacting
a
bill
to
indemnify
evidence
of
all
present
masters
and
chancery
in
order
to
facilitate
an
--
an
inquiry
--
i'll
correct
myself
--
in
order
to
facilitate
the
trial
of
lord
chancellor
makerfield
who
had
lately
been
impeached,
a
trial
i
should
add
not
without
political
implications
in
that
day.
this
precedent
was
cited
along
with
a
number
of
others.
a
few
years
later,
in
1742,
in
a
memorable
debate
in
the
house
of
lords,
on
the
question
of
whether
a
bill
to
indemnify
evidence
should
be
passed
to
facilitate
an
inquiry
in
to
the
affairs
of
the
(inaudible),
robert
walpole
unto
who,
until
very
recently
had
been
prime
minister.
at
that
time,
the
bill
failed.
it
failed
on
grounds
of
wisdom.
the
precedence
for
such
a
bill
was
recognized.
as
with
more
following
review
of
the
early
history
concludes
and
his
scholarship
in
this
field,
i
think
is
undoubted.
the
tradition
of
granting
immunity
from
prosecution
as
a
lawful
method
of
annulling
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
unquestioned
in
english
history.
the
privilege
as
petitioner
has
noted
is
found
in
our
colonial
history
as
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
common
law
tradition.
as
such,
it's
found
its
way
into
the
bill
of
rights.
but
petitioner's
argument
that
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
should
be
read
as
conferring
an
absolute
privilege
of
silence,
i
think
is
foreclosed
by
the
proceedings
in
the
constitutional
convention
and
in
congress
in
connection
with
the
enactment
of
the
fifth
amendment.
madison's
journal
of
the
convention
shows
that
when
the
president's
power
to
grant
reprieves
and
pardons
was
under
discussion.an
amendment
was
proposed.
the
amendment
was
this
that
the
language,
the
power
--
the
president
shall
have
power
to
grant
reprieves
and
pardons
should
be
--
that
that
language
should
be
amended
to
add
the
words
"after
conviction,"
but
his
journal
shows
that
this
proposal
was
withdrawn.
after
james
wilson
of
pennsylvania
pointed
out
that
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
journal,
“that
pardon
before
a
conviction
might
be
necessary
in
order
to
secure
testimony
of
accomplices.”
james
wilson,
who
made
this
observation
will
be
recalled,
he's
one
of
the
outstanding
lawyers
at
the
day.
he
was
the
first
professor
of
law
at
the
college
of
philadelphia,
soon
to
become
the
university
of
pennsylvania,
and
as
your
honors
know,
was
one
of
the
original
members
of
this
court.
we
find
further
evidence
that
the
privilege
is
embedded
in
the
constitution
in
the
proceedings
in
connection
with
the
fifth
amendment.
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
originally
proposed
by
madison.
it
read
as
follows,
“no
person”
--
of
development
clause
--
“no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.”
when
this
provision
came
on
for
debate,
john
lawrence
of
new
york
raised
an
objection
to
that
language.
he
said,
“it
contains
a
general
declaration,
somewhat
conquer
to
laws
passed.”
he
thought,
from
the
annals,
i'm
quoting
from
the
annals.
“it
ought
to
be
confined
to
criminal
cases,”
and
proposed
an
amendment
which
was
adopted.
and
so,
the
fifth
amendment
as
we
know
it
reads,
"no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself."
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
refinement
of
language
too
came
from
one
of
the
distinguished
lawyers
of
the
day.
john
lawrence
had
been
aid
to
camp
to
washington,
had
been
the
presiding
judge
advocate
in
one
of
the
most
famous
state
trials
in
our
history,
that
of
major
john
andré,
and
was
soon
to
be
appointed
a
united
states
judge
for
the
district
of
new
york.
perhaps,
i
should
mention
the
citations
to
the
constitutional
convention
and
to
the
proceedings
in
the
annals
because
this
turned
up
as
we
continue
to
research
following
the
submission
of
our
brief.
i
have
previously
given
--
given
them
to
petitioner.
the
reference
from
the
journal
of
the
convention
is
from
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
i'll
be
glad
to,
your
honor.
petitioner
has
spoken
eloquently
of
the
just
grievances
of
the
puritans
and
other
religious
descendants.
i
suggest
that
they
are
forever
protected
against
the
rebirth
of
the
inquisitions
of
the
17th
century
by
the
first
amendment,
so
to
the
right
of
political
dissent
unless
and
until
--
and
until
that
crosses
the
boundary
of
protected
activity
by,
for
example,
incitement
of
the
violent
overthrow
of
constitutional
government.
i
will
not
hear
it
as
the
one
of
the
dennis
issues.
that
is
a
separate
difficult
problem.
my
point
is
that
absolute
protection
against
criminal
consequences
for
peaceable
and
orderly
dissent
is
found
in
the
first
amendment,
but
i
find
no
evidence
and
petitioner
has
pointed
to
none
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
intended
to
confer
on
the
witness
in
a
lawful
inquiry
into
serious
crime,
a
privilege
of
absolute
silence.
the
tradition
of
granting
immunity
at
a
lawful
method
of
compelling
testimony
is
equally
embedded
in
our
law
which
has
developed
since
the
constitution.
in
1808,
we
find
thomas
jefferson
granting
a
pardon
to
one
dr.
bolling
that
his
testimony
might
be
compelled
at
the
trial
of
aaron
burr.
i
rely
on
the
fact
that
thomas
jefferson,
who
was
well
acquainted
with
our
constitutional
liberty,
used
that
device.
as
it
happened,
dr.
bolling
volunteered
his
testimony,
refused
the
pardon
so
we
do
not
have
a
--
a
precedent
for
compulsion.
from
the
early
1800s,
the
states
and
since
the
middle
of
the
19th
century,
the
united
states
have
had
statutes
granting
immunity
in
particular
kinds
of
cases
in
exchange
for
testimony.
by
1892,
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
had
been
upheld
in
at
least
eight
states,
including
new
york
and
massachusetts.
in
that
year,
they
came
before
this
court
and
--
or
the
federal
statute
came
before
this
court
in
consummate.
as
we
know,
the
court
there
declared
unconstitutional,
the
earlier
federal
statute,
on
the
ground
that
the
immunity
given
was
not
coextensive
with
the
exposure
to
criminal
liability
brought
on
by
the
testimony.but
in
that
case,
the
court
suggested
the
device
which
has
since
been
so
extensively
been
used.
there,
the
court
said,
“in
view
of
the
constitutional
provision,
a
statutory
enactment
to
be
valid
must
afford
absolute
immunity
against
future
prosecution
for
the
offense
to
which
the
question
relates.”
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
that
is
--
is
a
little
bit
in
doubt.
the
--
the
precedence
as
i
understand
them
are
something
that
sir
john
marshall
in
the
first
case
so
held.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
since
that
time,
the
court
so
held,
referring
to
this
wilson
case
but
there
is
a
more
recent
case
which
involved
a
pardon
where
a
--
a
sentence
of
death
was
reduced
to
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
the
question
came
up
and
then
the
pardon
was
refused.the
question
came
up
whether
the
pardon
was
a
private
act
between
the
president
and
the
person
to
whom
it
was
extended
or
whether
the
pardon
was
operated
to
restrain
the
hands
of
all
departments
of
the
government,
which
had
before
them,
a
lawful
judicial
order
of
execution.
the
court
there
held
that
the
pardon
did
operate
to
restrain
all
departments
of
the
government.
i
suggest
that
may
have
cut
in
a
little
bit
to
the
earlier
doctrines.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
it
was
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
the
statute
which
congress
passed
after
the
civil
war
has
usually
been
--
often
been
referred
to
where
the
general
amnesty
statute
and
that
was
upheld.
there
is
a
case
involving
a
conflict
between
that
statute
and
the
pardon
of
the
president.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
and
--
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
it
could,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
suggest
that
this
is
a
sort
of
extension
of
amnesty.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
point.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
don't
--
i'm
sorry
i
don't
get
this
point.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
if
he
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
he
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
yes,
he
is
heading
directly
into
--
weigh
the
--
weigh
the
authority
to
go
back
200
years
to
the
origin
of
that
authority.
it
was
originally
the
sole
prerogative
of
the
king
to
pardon,
to
forgive
for
crime.
it
wasn't
until
the
18th
century,
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
when
parliament
at
the
latter
days
of
this
court
felt
strong
enough
and
flexed
its
muscle
and
took
upon
itself
the
power
to
grant
pardons.
it
was
called
pardons.
it
was
called
amnesty.
since
those
days,
200
years
ago,
the
legislative
power
to
excuse
crime,
ab
initio
if
you
will
as
numerous
presidents,
the
civil
war
amnesty
statute
being
one
which
comes
to
mind
as
the
one
which
has
been
upheld
by
this
court.
so,
we
come
to
brown
versus
walker.
petitioner
speaks
of
that
case
as
coming
to
this
court
by
the
narrowest
of
margins.
it
wasn't
by
the
four-decision.
the
four
dissenting
judges
drew
not
upon
the
authority
or
the
experience
of
the
past.
they
cited
no
precedent
to
the
--
in
support
of
their
judgment
with
two
exceptions,
one
being
a
previous
court
of
appeals
case
which
gave
rise
to
the
conflict
which
was
resolved
in
brown
versus
walker.
the
other,
being
a
pennsylvania
case,
where
in
dictum
a,
concerning
the
right
of
electors
to
claim
an
oath
of
persons
coming
to
vote
that
they
had
during
the
late
--
during
the
revolution
remained
faithful
at
all
times
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
the
united
states,
was
declared
a
wrongful
--
a
wrongful
vote,
one
that
could
not
be
demanded.
the
pennsylvania
court,
it
is
true,
talked
in
terms
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
when
the
same
problem
came
before
this
court
after
the
civil
war,
the
statutes
of
that
type
were
struck
down
as
ex
post
facto
law.
since
brown
versus
walker,
and
i'll
deal
with
some
of
the
points
made
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
a
moment.
the
doctrine
of
that
case
has
been
relied
on,
referred
to,
quoted
in
a
dozen
of
solved
cases
and
it
is
of
a
unique
quality
because
since
that
decision
in
1896,
i
think
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
there
has
not
been
a
dubitante,
there
has
not
been
a
doubt,
there
has
not
been
a
referral
back
to
this
closed
question
in
1896,
with
one
possible
exception
and
that
is
there
have
been
a
few
references
in
dissenting
opinions
of
mr.
justice
black
which
refer
to
the
privilege
in
terms
of
a
privilege
of
absolute
silence.
there
are
comments
in
phrases
that
are
not
directed
to
the
issue
we
have
before
us,
but
--
but
for
those,
i
know
of
not
a
hint
in
any
opinion
of
this
court
that
casts
doubt
upon
the
doctrine.
now,
to
come
to
the
objections,
petitioner
says
that
this
statute
doesn't
protect
him
from
criminal
prosecution
as
it
must
under
the
fifth
amendment,
taking
a
point
beyond
his
doctrine
that
most
immunity
statute
would
be
justified.he
says
because
he
is
still
exposed
to
state
prosecution.
in
dealing
with
this
argument,
i'd
like
to
approach
it
in
the
alternative.
i'm
in
a
happy
position
of
having
authority
about
as
solid
as
an
attorney
before
your
bar
can
have
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
federal
immunity
statute
to
protect
the
witness
from
state
prosecution.
but
i
have
here
a
statute
where
congress
sought
to
exercise
its
entire
power
and
to
grant
such
immunity
if
it
could
and
we
think
it
could.
the
problem
is
an
aspect
of
dual
sovereignty
which
has
given
rise
to
many
vexing
problems
in
our
federal
system.
this
court,
however,
has
approached
that
problem
in
the
context
of
immunity
statutes
from
every
end.
it
has
upheld
state
prosecutions
against
the
argument
that
the
state
could
not
and
in
fact
did
not
protect
against
federal
prosecutions.
it
is
--
it
upheld
federal
statutes
against
the
argument
that
they
did
not
and
could
not
protect
against
the
state
prosecutions.
and
finally,
it
is
in
the
belmont
case
upheld
a
conviction
in
federal
court,
not
without
where
he
dissent
i
should
note,
based
upon
testimony
which
had
been
given
in
a
state
proceeding
under
a
state
immunity
statute.
the
reasoning
follows
from
a
long
series
of
decisions
expressing
the
principles
underlying
our
federation
then
from
fact
the
bill
of
rights
is
a
restraint
on
the
federal
government.
and
so,
the
grant
of
immunity
has
always
been
interpreted
as
a
restraint
only
on
the
sovereignty
which
grants
the
immunity.
that
is
the
authority.
as
i
have
said,
i
don't
have
to
rely
wholly
on
that.
if
the
court
reexamines
this
early
doctrine
and
comes
to
the
next
question,
i
think
we
must
prevail
on
that.
as
judge
weinfeld
notes
in
his
opinion
on
this
question,
the
house
report
accompanying
the
bill,
makes
it
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
give
the
witness
the
greatest
protection
which
it
--
was
within
its
power
to
confirm.
this
court's
decision
in
adams
versus
maryland
was
before
congress
at
the
time.
it
was
suggested
to
congress
that
while
the
problem
of
adams,
the
maryland
concerned
only
the
testimony
actually
given
before
a
congressional
committee.
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
problem
involved
in
this
sort
of
case
was
broader.it
involved
not
only
the
testimony
but
leads
which
might
be
derived
from
the
testimony.
a
question
was
raised
in
the
course
of
the
hearings
whether
the
rationale
of
adams
versus
maryland
would
extend
to
protect
against
criminal
consequences
and
state
prosecutions
in
that
broader
content.
our
position
is
that
it
would.
the
statute
is
limited
to
national
security
measures,
treason,
sabotage,
espionage,
like
this
case.
investigations
into
matters
concerning
the
national
security
come
close
to
the
heart
of
the
exercise
of
federal
power.
congress,
under
the
constitution,
is
obliged
to
provide
for
the
common
defense.
this
court
could
hardly
say
that
legislation
like
this
designed
to
develop
facts
relating
to
wartime
espionage
is
not
reasonably
necessary
and
proper
and
appropriate
to
the
exercise
of
that
federal
power.
if
that
is
so,
under
the
supremacy
clause,
we
think
that
a
witness
who
testified
under
the
statute
would
be
protected
against
prosecution
in
state
courts.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
problem
of
statutory
construction,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well
i
--
maybe
we
can
look
together
at
the
statute
and
then
i
will
state
the
rationale
on
which
we
rely.
the
statute
is
found
at
page
54
and
55
of
our
brief.
it
says
"but
no
such
witness
shall
be
prosecuted
or
subjected
to
any
penalty,"
the
bottom
of
page
54
running
over
on
55.
"no
such
witness
shall
be
prosecuted
or
subjected
to
any
penalty
on
account
of
transaction
matter
or
a
thing."
and
then,
as
to
the
testimony
itself,
tracking
brown
--
the
adams
versus
maryland
case,
it
says
"nor
shall
a
testimony
be
so
--
so
compelled,
be
used
as
evidence
against
him"
the
last
three
words
"in
any
court."
we
think
"in
any
court”
means
that
this
court
held
in
adams
versus
maryland,
any
federal
or
state
court.
we
think
that
a
command
that
no
such
witness
shall
be
prosecuted
applies
the
proceedings
in
federal
and
state
courts.
now,
the
rationale
of
our
power
--
the
rationale
of
our
argument
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
this,
we
borrow
directly
from
the
rationale
used
by
this
court
in
adams
versus
maryland.
the
inquiry
is
necessary
and
appropriate
to
the
exercise
of
a
delegated
federal
power.
the
means
used
is
not
inappropriate
to
that
end,
federal
law
or
federal
and
state
laws
conflict
is
supreme.
well,
we
have
the
statute
before
us,
i
would
like
turn
to
this
question
of
whether
the
statute
places
in
the
district
court
a
non-judicial
function.
i
question
whether
the
court
will
reach
any
serious
question
in
this
area.
the
statute
speaks
for
itself.
looking
on
page
54,
it
provides
that
whenever
in
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
attorney,
a
testimony
of
any
witness
and
so
on,
dropping
down
below
the
numbers,
is
necessary
to
the
public
interest.
he,
upon
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
shall
make
application
to
the
court
that
the
witness
be
instructed
to
testify,
and
upon
order
of
the
court,
such
witness
shall
not
be
excused
from
testifying.
to
analyze
the
statute,
we
think
in
the
first
place,
it
authorizes
the
united
states
attorney
to
do
certain
things.
that
is
one
of
his
judgment,
testimony
is
necessary
to
seek
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
and
then
go
before
the
court.
it
empowers
the
court
to
do
certain
things,
to
issue
an
order
when
it
determines
that
the
testimony
is
within
the
framework
of
the
statute
and
no
legal
reason
exists
for
the
refusal
to
testify.
and
finally,
the
statute
itself
grants
the
immunity
to
those
who
are
compelled
to
testify.
i
suggest
that
this
talk
about
the
attorney
general
granting
the
immunity
or
the
court
granting
the
immunity
is
simply
a
looseness
of
expression.
it
is
congress
that
grants
the
immunity
when
the
conditions
set
forth
in
this
statue
are
complied
with.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
let
me,
first,
in
explanation
of
my
suggestion
point
to
the
fact
that
i
referred
to
the
command
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute
which
says
“but
no
such
witness
shall
be
prosecuted.”
it
is
that
command
which
i
read
as
what
we've
talked
about
loosely
at
the
grant
of
immunity.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
if
it
said
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
i
think
it
would
present
a
different
problem.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
is
the
problem
which
we
will
have
to
discuss
for
sure.
when
and
if
we
come
before
this
court
on
sections
(a)
and
(b)
of
this
statute
or
there
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
i
should
think
so.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
before
embarking
on
that
discussion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
wouldn't
conceive
for
a
moment
that
the
function
of
the
district
court
would
be
a
rubber
stamp
function.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
if
we
look
on
page
53
where
the
sections
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
statute
are
recorded,
we
find
in
the
language
to
the
full
margin
about
the
fifth
line.
such
an
order
may
be
issued
by
united
states
district
court.
now,
that
suggests
discretion.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
if
we
look
down
in
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
but
i
–
i
have
to
point
out
that
it
is
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
further
to
the
same
effect
is
the
language
in
the
fifth
line
from
the
bottom,
“and
thereafter,
having
secured
the
approval
of
the
united
states
district
court.”
now,
when
we
face
that
language
in
a
case
before
this
court,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
our
position
would
be
that
that
gives
him
a
power
to
approve
the
exercise
of
discretion
on
issues
of
public
policy
which
has
been
taken
by
the
attorney
general
or
whether
we
will
construe
it
as
we
do
subsection
(c)
as
reading
the
approval
as
the
approval
within
a
normal
function
of
the
court
when
presented
with
the
contumacious
witness,
which
is
in
the
nature
of,
is
this
a
lawful
investigation?
is
it
--
is
--
are
the
questions,
questions
which
may
be
asked
this
witness.
in
this
case,
it's
--
does
the
inquiry
reasonably
relate
to
the
national
security
or
defense
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it's
fair
to
say
he
did
say
approval
as
to
both
and
it's
fair
also
to
notice
that
the
house
committee
report,
which
this
court
has
said
from
time
to
time,
is
the
authority
when
this
conflict
does
distinguish
in
a
murky
way
between
the
two.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i'm
--
i'm
speculating
because
i
have
to
reason
from
the
fact.
the
--
this
isn't
laid
out
on
the
record.
the
history
of
this
statute
shows
that
there
was
conflict
a
between
the
views
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
views
of
congress.
the
attorney
general
is
responsible
for
law
enforcement.
the
attorney
general
is
the
officer
of
the
government
who
knows,
who
is
responsible
for
assembling
all
relevant
information
as
to
whether
persons
have
committed
crime
within
the
federal
jurisdiction.
the
attorney
general,
from
the
beginning
of
this
discussion
of
immunity
statutes,
which
goes
back
to
1947,
whenever
he
appeared,
whenever
he
addressed
the
communication
to
congress,
invited
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
his
opinion,
it
was
unsound
unless
the
attorney
general
was
given
an
opportunity
to
express
his
views,
otherwise,
congress
might
inadvertently
confer
what's
--
what
these
debates
refer
to
as
an
immunity
ban
on
witnesses
which
had
no
intention
to
--
to
immunize
from
prosecution.
as
this
conflict
came
to
ahead,
the
final
statute
was
one
which
did
not
give
the
attorney
general
what
the
opponents
of
the
attorney
general's
power
called
a
veto
power.
he
did
not
give
him
a
veto
power
but
it
gave
him
the
privilege
of
presenting
his
views
to
the
district
court.
well,
per
necessitate,
there
we
have
a
situation
where
congress
has
said,
“we
will
compel
this
man
to
testify.”
there
is
a
condition
subsequent.
the
attorney
general's
view
shall
be
presented
to
the
court.
well
now,
in
that
case,
the
court
--
there
was
a
contemplation
of
a
function
for
the
court
in
giving
way
to
the
attorney
general's
views.
but
when
they
came
to
the
attorney
general's
section,
there
is
no
such
necessity
for
accommodation.
there
is,
however,
a
safeguard,
a
real
function
in
the
court
and
that
is
this.
again,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
things
that
they
were
concerned
about
very
seriously
was
the
immunity
act
problem.
if
before
a
man
was
--
come
testified
and
by
that
claim
--
after
claim
and
got
his
immunity,
the
court
entered
into
the
picture
to
determine
that
the
investigation
was
in
fact
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
there
was
some
small
safeguard
against
a
grand
jury
running
wild
in
a
proceeding
where
the
immunity
statute
have
been
invoked.
now,
i
suggest
that
there
is
a
function
for
the
judge,
but
it
is
not
a
function
which
raises
any
serious
constitutional
question
as
to
the
exercise
of
non-judicial
function
by
the
court.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
is
an
original
suggestion
in
the
sense
that
i
have
seen
no
inquiry
of
it
and
i
can
suggest
another.
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
dissent,
wigmore
says
the
only
reason
to
him
that
makes
any
sense
in
brown
versus
walker
was
that
the
witness
who
testified
and
let
loose
upon
himself
evidence
which
might
be
used
against
him
might
not
be
able
to
prove
his
immunity.
the
secret
nature
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
was
alluded
to
it.
this
order
of
the
court,
invoking
a
statute
granted
to
immunity,
of
course,
is
a
permanent
memorial
of
the
fact
that
the
witness
concerned
has
been
called
to
testify
and
would
indicate
in
general
the
subject
matter
with
which
he
was
--
this
testimony
was
concerned,
thereby,
making
it
more
facilitating
his
defense,
should
he
be
prosecuted
in
a
state
or
federal
court
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony?
now,
i
have
no
--
nothing
in
the
congressional
proceedings
to
point
to
--
to
indicate
that
that
was
seriously
considered
by
the
congress,
but
it
is
an
aspect
of
the
statute
which
helps
us
meet
one
of
the
objections
which
was
urged
very
seriously
by
mr.
justice
shiras
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
of
course.
of
course
that's
that
--
that
is
our
--
our
first
position.
we
say
that
this
function
of
the
court
is
a
description
in
the
statute,
obvious
function
whenever
a
contumacious
witness
is
brought
before
it.
as
i
understood
your
argument
or
your
suggestion,
i
should
say,
it
was
the
--
well,
this
must
mean
something
different
because
it's
in
the
statute.
so,
we
have
been
exploring
what
possibly
different
it
might
mean.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
that's
--
that
certainly
is
our
position.
i
would
argue
and
support
of
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
section
(c)
that
requires
a
broader
or
different
interpretation.
and
that
if
it
be
deemed
that
a
broader
and
different
interpretation
raises
a
serious
constitutional
question,
we
have
weighed
the
authority
that
that
interpretation
which
raises
the
question
should
not
be
read
into
the
statute,
but
we
should
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
on
that
particular
question,
we
do
have
legislative
history
that
explains
it.
the
statute
down
to
the
last
phrase
where
the
statute
has
originally
ground,
it
was
pointed
out
that
this
might
loose
for
the
statute
the
advantage
which
this
court
had
just
found
in
adams
versus
maryland.
so,
the
particular
language
from
the
compulsory
testimony
act
of
1895
was
attacked
right
on.
so,
there
is
an
overlap.
in
other
words,
i
would
suggest
--
it
would
be
my
position
that
the
earlier
any
matter
or
a
thing
includes
--
includes,
of
course
includes
the
testimony
and
the
evidence
given
in
response
to
the
question.
but
this
was
added
out
of
abundance
of
caution
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
statute
might
be
read
and
not
to
confer
the
immunity
from
state
prosecutions
which
the
court
had
found
in
the
1857
act
and
answers
to
merits.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
yes,
i
think
those
are
the
reasons
that
were
added.
now,
my
suggestion
that
the
first
clause
includes
state
prosecutions
is
taken
from
the
last
line
of
page
54
but
no
witness
shall
be
prosecuted.
i
read
that
as
a
command,
both
to
federal
courts
and
the
state
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes
sir,
yes,
sir.
the
house
committee
said
this,
“the
language
of
the
amendment
that
no
witness
shall
be
prosecuted
and
so
forth
is
sufficiently
broad
to
ban
a
subsequent
state
prosecution
if
it
be
determined
that
congress
has
the
constitutional
power
to
do
so.”
in
other
words,
they
were
intentionally
granting
the
statute
to
have
the
broadest
possible
scope
as
they
say
to
confer
the
fullest
protection
that
can
be
afford
of
the
witness
under
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
right,
yes
sir,
but
out
of
caution
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
the
way
i
understand
the
legislative
history,
yes.
finally,
petitioner
makes
an
attack
on
the
regularity
of
the
proceeding,
good
faith
of
the
attorney
general.
he
said,
“this
is
an
inquisition
on
political
belief,
the
vise
to
entrapping
in
perjury.”
i
won't
take
long
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
question,
that
suggestion.
the
questions
which
were
asked,
which
this
court
noted
when
they
turned
to
the
question,
were
not
about
political
parties
or
political
beliefs.
it's
whether
various
persons
employed
by
the
government
did
engage
in
a
common
enterprise,
having
its
objective
the
attaining
from
government
files
of
classified
information
relating
to
the
national
defense
and
security
of
the
united
states.
that
is
espionage
i
think
by
any
definition
of
the
word.
the
second
branch
of
this
attack
rest
on
proposition
that
petitioner
should
be
excused
from
testifying
because
he
fears
a
prosecution
for
perjury.
that
suggestion
goes
to
the
bottom
of
the
adversary
system.
cases
are
decided
on
facts.
it's
been
the
experience
of
the
common
law
that
facts
are
more
likely
to
be
developed
if
the
persons
asked
to
testify
to
those
facts
are
compelled
to
speak
truly
on
pain
or
punishment.
for
that
reason,
this
immunity
statute
of
course
excludes
convictions
for
perjury.
when
this
court
first
faced
that
problem
in
the
glickstein
case
in
222
united
states,
it
said,
“this
must
be
the
result
as
it
cannot
be
conceived
that
there
is
power
to
compel
the
giving
of
testimony
where
no
right
exist
to
require
that
the
testimony
shall
be
given
under
such
circumstances
and
safeguards
as
to
compel
it
to
be
truthful.”
petitioner
suggests
that
this
statute
may
be
used
as
an
instrument
of
government
--
governmental
tyranny.
so,
it
may,
so
may
any
governmental
power.
if
i
may
borrow
from
mr.
justice
holmes,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
assume
that
it
will
not
become
an
instrument
of
tyranny
while
this
court
exists.
the
department
of
justice
regards
the
power
to
invoke
this
statute
in
the
words
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
as
one
of
tremendous
responsibility.
the
exercise
of
which
must
be
guarded
by
discretion
and
wisdom.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
oh,
of
course
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
should
assume
not.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
should
assume
that
if
the
attorney
general
is
plainly
and
clearly
proceeding
beyond
the
confine
of
the
statute,
if
the
attorney
general
--
if
a
speech
should
be
given,
let's
not
say
the
attorney
general.
put
it
down
the
line,
that
this
proceeding
is
just
to
get
these
people
then
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
this
is
in
the
area
of
reviewability
of
judicial
--
of
administrative
discretion
where
the
discretion
had
been
placed
in
the
executive
department.
now,
this
court
has
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
take
to
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
now,
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
question
was,
are
there
any
imaginable
circumstances
where
the
court
could
step
in
and
restrain
the
exercise
of
that
discretion?
mr.
charles
f.
barber
of
the
granting
of
immunity,
and
i'm
--
my
answer
is
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
there
would
be
no
circumstances
where
the
court
would
not
have
a
function,
would
not
--
under
the
law
as
we
know
it,
would
not
have
the
power
to
restrain
that
exercise.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
but
that's
--
that
time
is
taking
it
to
the
most
extreme
case.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
don't
think
so,
and
i
don't
think
so.
i'd
say
the
statute
places
the
--
the
exercise
of
judgment
in
the
first
instance
in
the
united
states
attorney,
but
it
permits
him
to
go
before
the
court
only
with
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general.
now,
whether
that
is
a
personal
approval
or
approval
of
the
--
the
officers
that
the
attorney
general
makes
responsible
for
this,
of
course,
at
the
present
time
the
most
active
person
in
it
is
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
internal
security
division.
now,
in
this
case,
the
judgment,
the
discretion
was
exercised
by
the
attorney
general
in
person
as
shown
in
the
record
by
his
letter
to
judge
lumbard,
the
united
states
attorney
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
the
question
whether
it
could
be
delegated
to
an
assistant
attorney
general,
it
isn't
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
what
i
would
say
if
we
have
to
face
it.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
thank
you,
your
honor,
yes.
my
suggestion
might
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
f.
barber
wherein
the
judgment
in
subject
to
the
approval
of
that
was
a
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i'm
not
sure
how
far
would
that
carry
me
and
if
i
thought
about
it
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
your
honor.
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
flash
back
on
where
i
started
and
that
is
this.
our
question
is
whether
congress
has
made
on
allowable
judgment.
i
think
we
find
that
the
tradition
of
our
law
answers
yes.
but
now,
much
can
be
said,
pro
and
con
on
the
wisdom
of
this
legislation.
one
of
the
startling
thing
in
the
preparation
of
this
case
has
been
to
know
that
the
arguments
in
congress
in
1952
and
1953,
the
arguments
in
congress
in
1895,
the
arguments
in
congress
in
1857,
the
arguments
in
the
house
of
lords
in
1803,
the
arguments
of
the
house
of
lords
in
1742
are
all
but
for
style
of
language
interchangeable.
the
question
of
the
wisdom
of
this
sort
of
legislation
when
you're
forced
to
make
an
accommodation
between
two
principles
which
you
hold
dear
is
a
hard
one
to
make
under
our
constitution
that
judgment
in
the
first
instance
is
placed
in
congress.
congress
has
made
a
decision.
we
think
that
decision
is
unallowable.
and
for
that
reason,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
law
below
should
be
affirmed.
