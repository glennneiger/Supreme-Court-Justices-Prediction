you're
--
you're
addressing
yourself
right
at
this
problem
but
only
to
the
problem
of
statutory
construction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
going
to
take
up
the
question
of
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
do
this
or
you're
combining
the

justice

the
first
clause
in
view
of
the
murdock
case
might
not
apply
to
the
prosecution
of
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
the
clause
was
added,
it
might
prefer
only
to
testimony
that
he
gave
instead
of
the
crime
which
he
might
be
charged
it
upon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
--
even
though
they
didn't
understand
anything
about
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
your
point
of
view
then,
the
addition
of
the
last
clause
was
unnecessary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

of
caution.
