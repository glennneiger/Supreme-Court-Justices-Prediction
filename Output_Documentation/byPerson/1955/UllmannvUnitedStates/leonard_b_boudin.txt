mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
the
court
please.
we
seek
here
the
review
of
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
affirming
the
petitioner's
conviction
for
contempt
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
for
refusing
to
answer
second
question
before
a
federal
grand
jury.
questions
as
to
which
he
said
it
properly
and
undeniably
as
a
constitutional
privilege
against
self
incrimination
of
the
questions
which
were
weld
by
the
trial
court
to
be
--
by
the
district
court
to
be
answerable
under
the
immunity
act
of
1954,
which
i
will
first
describe
at
length
to
this
court.
the
immunity
act
of
1954,
which
appears
in
the
appendix,
is
the
first
general
immunity
statute
in
the
history
of
this
country,
notwithstanding
various
observations
that
appear
on
the
brief.
it
is
a
statute
which
had
its
origin
in
the
attempt
of
certain
congressional
committee
to
secure
information
with
respect
to
communism,
and
its
principle
sponsor
was
senator
mccarran.
it
was
eventually
tasked
very
hastefully
in
the
closing
days
of
the
83d
congress,
and
it
deals
not
only
with
the
congressional
committee,
which
was
the
main
purpose
of
this
bill.
there
are
also
deals
that
subpoenas
came
in
at
the
end,
congressional
committee
from
grand
jury,
an
ancillary
purpose
which
at
this
point
i
will
make
shortly.
this
bill
provide
with
respect
to
congressional
committee
that
in
the
event
that
the
witness
had
set
its
privilege
before
a
congressional
committee
and
the
committee
by
a
two-thirds
vote
or
the
house
involved
by
a
majority
vote
desires
to
compel
the
testimony
notwithstanding
the
privilege,
then
an
application
could
be
made
to
a
district
court
for
a
notice
to
the
attorney
general
who
can
appeal
and
oppose
or
support,
and
the
district
court
will
then
decide
whether
immunity
is
to
be
given
in
the
case
of
the
congressional
committee
witness
and
that
order
will
be
followed.
if
the
merit
is
to
be
given,
then
the
witness
will
be
compelled
to
testify.
that
section
or
those
sections,
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
statute,
i
mentioned
to
give
you
the
full
statute,
they
are
not
before
this
court
directly.
what
is
before
this
court
is
section
(c)
of
the
statute
which
reads
in
material
language
as
follows.
whenever
in
a
judgment
of
a
united
states
attorney,
the
testimony
of
any
witness
or
the
production
of
books,
papers
or
other
evident
by
any
witness
in
any
case
or
proceeding
before
any
grand
jury
or
court
of
the
united
states
involving
and
then
referred
to
--
then
there
comes
a
reference
to
various
statutes
dealing
with
national
defense,
national
security
in
sedition.
in
those
so-called
national
security
cases
which
i
will
use
in
my
discussion
here
today
without
conceding
the
propriety
or
the
applicability
of
the
term,
it
is
provided
that
where
the
judgment
of
the
u.s.
attorney
is
to
the
effect
that
the
testamentary
“is
necessary
to
the
public
interest,
he,
upon
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
shall
make
application.”
i
emphasize
the
word
“application”
to
the
court
“that
the
witness
shall
be
instructed
to
testify
or
produce
evidence
subject
to
the
provision
of
this
section
and
upon
order
of
the
court,”
and
i
emphasize
the
words
“upon
order.”
“the
witness
shall
not
be
excused
in
testifying
or
to
testify
and
receive
what
is
referred
to
generally
in
the
statute
as
an
immunity
against
prosecution,
as
an
immunity
against
penalties
or
forfeiture.”
the
statute
is
not
clear,
of
course,
as
to
whether
--
and
no
statute
actually
has
been
as
to
whether
it's
intended
by
the
term
“penalty
or
forfeiture,”
a
point
that
we
will
discuss
later
on.
it
should
be
noted,
however,
in
my
passing
reference
with
the
statute
here
that
while
it
appears
that
immunity
is
given
against
the
use
of
the
testimony
in
any
court,
state
or
federal,
following
this
court's
decision
in
adams,
which
is
common
upon
the
house
committee
report.
it
is
by
no
means
clear,
although,
this
is
not
the
burden
of
my
main
argument
that
the
witness
cannot
be
prosecuted
in
a
state
court
for
the
crimes
which
were
revealed
by
his
compelled
testimony.
i
mentioned
that
because,
as
i
say,
it
is
a
point
we
make,
although,
not
central
to
our
thing.
now,
as
to
the
facts,
the
petitioner
is
one
of
a
series
of
government
employee.
he
worked
12
years
to
the
united
states
government,
retiring
honorably
in
1947.
a
group
of
government
employees,
particularly
those
in
the
treasury
department,
who,
for
about
eight
years,
had
been
subject
to
accusations
by
one
elizabeth
bentley
of
being
members
of
the
communist
party
and
of
an
espionage
reign
in
the
treasury
department.
as
the
record
shows
to
this
court,
we'll
undoubtedly
know
from
general
observation,
these
charges
were
received
great
currency.
i
received
the
imprimatur
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
a
point
later
to
be
discussed
by
me.
and
these
witnesses,
including
the
petitioner,
have
for
eight
years
and
here
before
a
congressional
committee,
grand
jury
repeatedly,
sometimes
before
the
same
committee,
sometimes
before
the
same
grand
jury,
sometimes
before
several
committees,
and
in
the
particular
case,
my
client
was
called
before
the
fbi
in
april
1947,
a
grand
jury
in
new
york
in
november
1947
and
i
will
discuss
the
other
half
after
the
recess.
without
going
into
all
the
gory
details,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
say
that
over
a
period
of
seven
and
a
half
years,
the
petitioner
was
called
eight
times
before
one
inquisitorial
body
or
another.
subjected
to
essentially
the
identical
inquiry
with
some
variations
for
view
of
the
contacts
to
the
inquiry,
but
all
of
them
were
predicated
in
one
way
or
another
on
the
bentley
charges
of
espionage
in
the
treasury
department
in
the
communism.
and
although
in
the
early
days
when
things
were
a
little
quiet
internationally
as
far
as
this
situation
is
concerned,
the
petitioner
for
example,
in
his
six-hour
interrogation
by
the
fbi
in
april
1947,
denied
all
the
charges
that
ms.
bentley
had
made
with
effect
to
espionage,
communist
party
membership
entered
with
no
prosecution
that
either
substantively
were
under
the
false
claims
act.
when
it
came
to
and
when
he
--
in
1948,
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
he
unequivocally
made
the
statement
appearing
at
page
12
of
the
brief
that
the
charges
were
false,
that
he'd
never
been
a
spy.
as
things
moved
on
and
times
changed
in
ways
that
are
well
known
to
the
court
that
were
reflected
as
more
recent
decisions,
the
petitioner
moved
back
because
of
the
very
reasonable
apprehension
upon
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
the
latest
of
these
inquiries,
and
of
course,
the
one
that
brings
us
to
this
court,
that
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
november
of
1954,
preceded
for
the
peculiar
reasons
that
have
a
copy
of
all
of
these
inquiries
by
only
three
weeks
before
subpoenaing
of
the
petitioner
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
district.
and
i
should
say
because
it
reflects
the
general
attitude
of
these
investigations
which
have
the
bearing
here.
but
simultaneously,
four
grand
juries
in
the
united
states
were
conducting
investigations
into
the
same
alleged
conspiracy
into
espionage.
somewhat,
this
is
being
called
before
several
grand
juries.
witnesses
are
being
called
before
grand
juries
in
areas
where
they
didn't
reside
and
in
a
sense
following
a
pattern
which
as
we
well
publicize
in
the
area
of
congressional
committee
operation,
but
which
we
have
hoped
our
grand
jury
system
would
not
spoil
air
to.
the
petitioner
was
called
in
november
1954
before
the
grand
jury
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
was
asked
questions
in
the
following
character.
first,
ms.
bentley
made
the
following
charges
of
espionage
“are
you
or
were
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
were
you
a
member
of
an
espionage
ring?
was
harry
dexter
white,
former
under
secretary
of
the
treasury,
was
mr.
currie,
former
administrative
assistant
of
franklin
d.
roosevelt,
our
president,
was
this
man
--
was
that
man
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
a
member
of
an
espionage
ring?”
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
petitioner
had
previously
denied
these
charges
under
oath,
some
five
years
ago.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
charges
(inaudible),
allegedly
under
investigation
in
1954,
were
charges
of
espionage
occurring
from
1941
to
1945.
petitioner
asserted
his
constitutional
privilege
in
the
southern
district
and
was
called
upon
notice
to
him
and
his
counsel
before
judge
weinfeld
in
the
southern
district,
and
the
government
made
an
application
to
judge
weinfeld,
the
director
of
petitioner,
answer
under
the
immunity
act
of
1954
which
i
summarize
to
your
honors.
we
had
an
extended
argument
before
judge
weinfeld
and
i
have
given
the
transcript
to
this
court
as
i
did
to
the
court
of
appeals
below.
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
the
petitioner
took
the
following
position.
he
said,
“this
is
not
a
bona
fide
inquiry
into
crime.
this
is
a
broad
political
issue
raised
by
the
attorney
general.
he
had
publically
charged
me
and
members
of
the
old
administration
with
espionage.”
and
the
attorney
general
having
testified
publically
that
he
has
had
proof
of
espionage
since
1945,
“but
don't
let
us
throw
down
and
i
cannot
survive
an
attack
by
the
attorney
general
if
i
testify.”
the
attorney
general
is
bound,
either
to
follow
my
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
with
an
indictment
for
substantive
crime
if
he
can
pick
something
out
of
my
testimony
or
it
is
more
likely
an
indictment
for
perjury,
and
not
so
much
in
the
area,
though
i
don't
discount
that
of
a
perjury
for
denying
the
espionage
charges,
but
perjury
for
denying
charges
relating
to
communist
party
affiliations
or
the
knowledge
of
others
because
the
problem
there
is
a
very
special
one
as
this
court
knows.
the
question
of
what
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
or
was
and
one's
knowledge
if
someone
else's
membership
of
the
communist
party,
far
from
being
the
precise
thing
we
had
thought
membership
was
some
years
ago
has
turned
out
in
cases
in
the
records
before
this
court
with
remington
and
other
cases
which
i've
cited
my
brief
to
be
a
far
less
substantial
doctrine.
and
the
witness
who
i've
lightheartedly
denies
or
likely
denies
known
as
lighthearted
in
this
area,
of
course,
knowledge
of
membership
of
other
people
or
himself
made
base
a
prosecution
for
perjury,
not
based
upon
proof
that
he
was
a
member,
but
based
upon
a
broad
scheme
of
circumstantial
evidence,
now
supported
by
the
communist
control
act's
criteria,
14
or
15
criteria
to
what
is
the
member
which
may
find
him
guilty
of
perjury
and
so
he's
subjected
to
a
prosecution
for
perjury
regardless
of
the
actual
innocence.
these
charges
in
essence
and
because
i
must
analyze
the
law
very
closely
to
your
honors,
i
can't
go
into
too
great
detail
now,
but
those
are
made
under
oath
by
petitioner
and
affidavit
to
judge
weinfeld.
judge
weinfeld
said
that
he
first
requested
an
affidavit
of
good
faith
in
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
such
an
affidavit,
a
formal
one,
alleging
no
fact
to
support
it,
was
given
by
the
united
states
attorney.
secondly,
judge
weinfeld,
although
requested
by
us,
to
examine
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
see
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
crime,
and
to
see
whether
they
did
not
support
our
position
that
what
was
happening
was
simply
the
usual
practice
of
congressional
committee
in
calling
witnesses
before
them
and
asking
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
judge
weinfeld
declined
to
examine
the
grand
jury
minutes.
he
took
the
position
ultimately
at
any
rate
that
the
question
of
whether
immunity
should
be
granted,
assuming
that
the
united
states
attorney
said
this
was
an
investigation
into
a
national
security
crime
were
the
question
for
the
united
states
attorney,
not
for
the
judge.
and
so,
judge
weinfeld's
refusal
to
deliver
the
grand
jury
minutes
was
consistent
with
his
interpretation
of
the
statute.
allow
us
--
i
may
now
indicate.
i
think
that
even
he
was
right
in
his
construction
of
the
statute,
which
we
will
challenge,
as
the
judge
supervising
the
grand
jury,
he
had
the
duty
described
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
hoffman
case
to
supervise
and
prevent
its
excessive,
any
abuse
of
its
processes,
a
doctrine
referred
to
so
well
in
the
--
in
the
hoffman
case
and
previously
articulated
by
this
court
or
suggested
at
any
rate
in
hale
against
henkel.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
thought
that
if
judge
weinfeld
examined
the
grand
jury
minutes,
he
would
see
there
was
no
evidence
of
crime
that
the
grand
jury,
in
calling
this
inquiry,
was
engaged
in
a
general
dragnet
inquiry
as
to
whether
somebody
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
but
really,
it
wasn't
searching
for
evidence
of
espionage
and
it
had
no
evidence
of
espionage
before
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
possibly
and
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
or
from
an
examination
of
ms.
bentley's
own
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
which
might
have
exposed
what
we
think
has
been
happening
in
the
last
10
years.
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
explicitly
indicated,
as
i
remember
the
transcript,
that
while
we
go
--
we
had
a
right
to
them,
we
at
least
one
of
the
judge
to
see
them.
we
wanted
some
protection
but
we
couldn't
get
total
protection.
now,
and
of
course,
judges
have
looked
if
your
honor
knows
the
grand
jury
minutes
without
a
party
being
allowed
to
see
them
and
the
court's
of
appeal
have
affirmed
that
policy.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
we
brought
the
entire
issue
here.
we've
raised
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
we
stated
--
we
stated
in
the
court
below
that
judge
weinfeld
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
have
stated
in
our
brief.
i
can't
remember
the
precise
point
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
--
may
i
come
to
that
in
a
moment
so
we
can
check
that.
now,
judge
weinfeld,
at
the
beginning
of
the
discussion,
indicated
that
he
thought
that
a
grant
of
the
--
that
the
order
which
he
would
ultimately
enter
should
contain
a
specific
grant
of
immunity.
later
on
--
and
that
appears
in
the
transcript
--
he
decided
that
he
would
make
no
reference
in
the
order,
either
to
a
grant
of
immunity
or
to
the
kind
of
immunity
that
we
were
going
to
receive.
in
other
words,
he
was
not
merely
even
going
to
describe
that.
now,
as
i've
indicated
in
my
brief,
the
reason
why
he
undoubtedly
did
that
was
because
he
thought
this
would
be
a
concession
to
our
general
theory
that
he
was
granting
the
immunity
because
he
described
it.
but
as
a
result,
the
petitioner
took
the
position
before
judge
weinfeld
and
does
here,
as
he
did
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
he
does
not
know
the
extent
of
the
immunity
which
had
offered
him
upon
his
testimony.
now,
after
judge
weinfeld
overruled
our
objections
and
directed
the
witness
to
answer
questions,
including
those
with
respect
to
political
affiliations
that
we
thought
were
improper,
we
appealed
that,
we
--
the
client
to
answer
those
questions
before
the
grand
jury
and
on
the
bases
of
the
record
of
stipulated
facts
before
judge
murphy,
who
did
not
review
the
matter
de
novo.
we
--
petitioner
was
convicted
of
contempt,
sentenced
to
six
months
in
prison
with
the
right
to
purge
and
we
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
one
of
the
tedious
arguments
ever
held,
namely,
eight
days
after
the
conviction
with
full
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals,
we
argued
this
matter
before,
our
second
circuit,
chief
judge
clark,
judge
frank
and
judge
galston,
sitting
by
designation.
the
extraordinary
thing
about
the
three
opinions
which
appear
at
pages
55,
59,
and
60,
is
that
each
of
the
three
judges
who
affirmed
the
conviction
below,
expressed
basic
sympathy
with
our
position
and
suggests
that
if
the
matter
had
come
to
them
de
novo,
they
might
well
have
decided
this
issue
in
our
favor.
and
by
this
issue,
i
should
be
fair
to
the
court
and
my
opponent
and
indicate
not
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
is
one
of
the
issues
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment,
but
the
broad
constitutional
issue
of
whether
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
compulsory
testimony.
we
are
now
here
on
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
turned
out
it
was
the
basis
for
the
grant
of
certiorari
raising
two
issues.
they
are
interrelated
but
they
are
distinct.
the
first
is
a
statutory
construction
issue.
was
the
court
under
the
duty
of
determining
whether
immunity
should
be
granted
or
was
that
the
sole
function
of
the
united
states
attorney
as
judge
weinfeld
held?
because
it
was
perfectly
clear
from
this
record
that
judge
weinfeld
did
not
examine
the
record,
made
those
study
to
determine
whether
if
he
had
discretion,
he
would
have
exercised
it
because
he
said,
“i
have
no
discretion
at
the
first
issue,”
and
i'm
going
to
discuss
that
first
in
deference
to
the
established
policy
of
the
court
even
though
the
constitutional
issues
are
so
important.
and
the
second
issue,
the
constitutional
issue,
which
i
will
next
discuss,
is
this.
is
this
immunity
law
which
moves
and
moves
in
the
realm
of
the
first
amendment
and
which
carries
with
it
the
extra
ordinary
sanctions
which
we
are
--
have
described
and
will
describe?
is
this
immunity
law
constitutional?
and
i
may
say
in
passing
that
we
are
not
taking
on
every
immunity
law
and
i
prepared
to
distinguish
brown
against
walker
even
though
we
think
this
is
an
original
proposition,
it
too
should
be
overruled.
now,
let
me
turn
first
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
if
i
may.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course.
this
appears,
sir,
in
the
statement
made
by
the
united
states
attorney's
formal
application
appearing
at
page
2
and
3
and
4
of
the
record
where
the
first
question
--
i
don't
know
what
your
honor
wants
me
to
read
or
whether
this
reference
is
insufficient.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
all
other
questions
relating
thereto.
there
is
no
limitation
in
this
order
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
to
those
particular
questions.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
order
appears
at
page
44
of
the
record.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
gives
us
the
equivalent
language
of
–-
yes,
to
produce
evidence
with
--
this
is
on
page
44,
“with
respect
to
matters
on
the
inquiry
before
said
grand
jury.”
in
other
words,
to
instruct
the
witness
to
answer
the
questions
propounded
to
him
before
the
grand
jury
and
to
testify
and
produce
evidence
with
respect
to
the
matters
on
the
inquiry.
i
think
that
answers
your
question,
sir,
as
to
that
point.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
sir,
page
44
of
the
record.
the
order
of
judge
weinfeld
is
about
the
second
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
begins
with
the
word
“accordingly”
on
page
44
of
the
record.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
think
so.
i
don't
know.
that
--
that
was
never
laid
out
by
the
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
or
he
would
be
guilty
of
contempt.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
my
--
i
said
i
want
to
rest
on
--
i
don't
want
to
rest
on
that
point.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
want
to
rest
on
that
point.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
that
was
error,
but
i
think
it's
a
small
error
compared
to
the
basic
problem.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
know
you're
not
asking
me
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
not
surrendering
that
point.
that's
clear,
but
i'm
not
emphasizing
it.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statute,
i
should
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
fairness
to
my
opponent
that
my
recollection
is
in
looking
at
some
of
the
old
records
such
as
hale
against
hankel
in
that
group
of
cases,
that
they
were
orders
following
the
general
phraseology
which
didn't
limit
it
to
the
questions
put.
now,
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
the
different
problem,
economic
regulation
of
course,
and
first
amendment
problems,
but
to
that
extent,
the
government
may
have
been
guided
in
drawing
this
order
and
judge
weinfeld
by
following
this
old
precious
and
i
owe
that
to
the
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course,
of
course.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
correct,
sir.
that
--
this
is
the
first
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
your
honor
is
quite
right.
i
hadn't
notice
that
distinction.
this
is
true.
this
is
the
first
statute,
federal
statute
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
in
which
a
judge,
as
we
construe
it,
directs
immunity.
in
all
the
other
cases,
the
immunity
is
automatic
where
the
witness
appeared.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
sir,
i'll
accept
that
modification.
now,
i
came
to
the
construction
of
the
statute.
the
court
will
note,
the
court
should
note
because
one
can't
look
at
the
statutes
alone,
the
words
upon
order
and
the
words
application
while
suggesting
an
appeal
to
the
discretion
of
a
federal
court,
the
appeal
which
i
think
is
inherent
in
every
application
to
a
court
unless
is
explicitly
stated
that
the
--
the
discretion
of
the
court
is
not
intended.
while
those
words
seem
to
suggest
discretion
in
the
court,
i
cannot
say
that
they
absolutely
require
it.
we
therefore
must
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
and
when
i
make
this
concession
that
those
are
not
words
which
permit
any
leeway
in
construction,
i
remind
the
court
of
what
i
said
at
the
beginning.
this
statute
was
rushed
through
at
28th
century
speed,
i
regret
20th
century
in
a
rare
way
which
we
now
use
it.
it
was
on
historical
period
in
which
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
and
this
one
on
two
or
three
other
statutes
were
passed,
and
nobody
had
a
chance
to
formulate
language
precisely.
they
know
whom
they
were
gunning
for.
they
didn't
know
how
best
to
do
it.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
clearly
shows
that
we
are
right
in
our
construction
and
it
was
intended
that
the
court
play
a
part
in
the
grant
of
immunity,
play
a
censorious
controlling
thought.
in
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
going
to
give
you
--
now,
i'll
give
you
the
bill
of
particulars,
quite
right.
immunity
legislation
was
proposed
beginning
with
senator
mccarran
from
1951
on
in
this
field
of
communism.
it
started
and
it
continues
with
a
severe
conflict
between
the
attorney
general
and
congress
as
to
who
should
grant
immunity,
at
least
at
the
beginning
in
the
congressional
field.
the
attorney
general
didn't
trust
congress.
congress
didn't
trust
the
attorney
general
and
my
bill
of
particulars
in
the
brief.
i
am
discussing
now
the
trust
of
the
morality.
i'm
discussing
the
trust
of
the
ability
to
use
discretion
properly.
senator
mccarran
was
a
vigorous
proponent
in
the
field
of
immunity
legislation
and
wiretapping
and
everything
else
of
congressional
power
as
against
executive
power,
whatever
my
other
differences,
whether
there
might
have
been,
there,
he
was
clear.
and
so,
s-16
which
came
through
first
and
which
is
the
only
bill
that
was
passed,
limited
to
congressional
committee
didn't
touch
on
grand
jury.
that
bill
was
buckled
up
to
two
years.
s-16
gave
congress
complete
control
over
the
immunity
power
with
respect
to
its
witnesses.s-16
remained
on
the
books
in
the
matter
of
--
to
remain
passed
by
the
senate
but
not
by
the
house,
and
the
matter
came
to
the
house
judiciary
committee.
there,
the
administration
through
representative
keating
supported
a
bill
known
as
h.r.
6899
referred
to
in
our
brief.
h.r.
6899
dealt
with
both
congressional
committees,
grand
jury
--
and
grand
juries
and
courts
as
well
and
gave
the
attorney
general
exclusive
power,
exclusive
control
over
the
immunity
power
with
respect
to
congressional
committees,
courts
and
grand
juries.
and
this
control,
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief,
uses
the
following
words
and
you'll
see
how
the
statue
has
been
modified.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it's
on
page
16,
the
language,
page
16
of
our
reply
brief
before
this
court.
whenever
in
the
judgment
of
the
attorney
general
were
those
words
remained
of
course.
in
any
case
before
a
grand
jury,
the
testimony
is
necessary.
such
witness
shall
not
be
excused
from
testifying
on
a
ground
that
the
testimony
required
of
him
may
incriminate
him.
and
in
the
passage
which
i
have
not
set
forth
in
my
brief
which
should
have,
i
may
say
that
the
original
bill
shows
another
paragraph
significant
and
that
it
gives
the
quality
of
the
conflict
between
congress
and
the
attorney
general.
the
judgment
of
the
attorney
general
at
any
testimony
if
necessary
shall
be
confirmed
by
him
in
a
written
communication,
foreclosed
and
shall
be
made
a
part
of
the
record
of
a
hearing
or
proceeding
in
which
such
testimony
or
evidence
is
given.
if
this
bill
had
passed
the
administration
bill
supported
by
the
attorney
general
before
the
committee,
we
would
not
be
here
today
arguing
this
particular
point,
but
it
didn't
pass.
it
didn't
pass
despite
the
vigorous
position
taken
by
the
attorney
general
in
support
of
it
referred
to
on
our
main
brief
at
pages
40
and
41.
what
happened
was
--
at
page
39
--
what
happened
was
that
the
subcommittee,
the
subcommittee
agreed
with
the
attorney
general,
but
the
main
committee
refused
to
agree.
and
the
house
judiciary
committee
rewrote
h.r.
6899,
rendered
a
report
in
which
have
said
we
have
--
or
that
full
committee
has
“substituted
its
own
version
as
a
complete
substitute,
both
to
s-16
as
it
has
passed
the
senate
and
as
it
has
been
reported
by
the
subcommittee.”
and
what
was
that
rewriting?
well,
that
rewriting
was
to
interpolate
the
words,
“he,
upon
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
shall
make
application
to
the
court.”
those
words
were
not
an
h.r.
6899.
those
words
were
put
in
by
the
full
committee.
and
when
the
full
committee
discussed
the
reasons
for
putting
in
for
changing
the
bill,
what
did
the
full
committee
say?
it
said,
“the
full
committee
amendment
requires
that
application
be
made
to
a
court,
whereas,
on
the
h.r.
6899”
--
i'm
reading
from
page
40
of
my
brief
--
“only
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
was
necessary,
prior
to
the
granting
of
immunity.”
is
there
anything
ambiguous
in
that
statement
and
is
there
anything
ambiguous
in
the
statement
which
follows,
which
is,
after
discussing
the
fact
that
before
congressional
committees,
"the
approval
of
united
states
district
court
foreclosed
the
required,”
the
committee
report
goes
on
to
say,
“in
cases
before
a
grand
jury
or
a
court
similar
precaution
exists.”
“in
all
cases,”
and
these
words
are
very
important
here,
“where
the
bill
authorizes
a
grant
of
immunity
after
the
privilege
have
been
claimed,
there
are
at
least
two
other
independent
but
interested
parties,
two
other
independent
but
interested
parties
who
must
concur
in
the
grant
of
immunity
in
order
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
bill.”
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
reading
from
house
report
2606
83d
congress
appearing
at
page
40
of
my
main
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
page
40.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
report
is
on
page
4
--
page
8.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
have
set
forth
the
entire
language
at
page
15
footnote
1,
because
the
government
i
think
incorrectly
claimed
that
we
might
have
misled
the
court.
so,
i
had
best
refer
you
to
page
15
or
our
reply
brief.
now,
the
words,
“two
other
independent,”
but
interested
parties
must
refer
in
the
case
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding
to
two
other
than
the
united
states
attorney
but
who
other
parties
there?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
all
right,
but
it
says,
“two
other
independent.”
who
did
the
other
referred
to?
in
other
words,
the
u.s.
attorney
is
the
one
who
comes
in
first,
then,
there
must
be
two
other
independent
that
interested
parties
that
must
concur.
those
two
other
can
only
be
the
attorney
general
and
the
united
states
district
court.
otherwise,
the
word
“other”
is
ruined.
now,
we
are
not
resting
alone
on
this
committee
report
as
long
though
it
is
because
representative
keating,
the
manager
of
the
bill
testified
and
stated
before
the
--
in
doing
the
congressional
debate,
the
language
i've
quoted
at
page
41
and
42
of
my
brief
at
the
bottom,
it
does
not
leave
the
final
determination
as
to
the
granting
of
immunity
in
either
the
hands
of
the
investigating
committee
or
the
attorney
general,
but
rather,
the
court.
now,
there
is
nothing
ambiguous
about
that
language.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
know
that,
i
know
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
let
me
read
to
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
one
passage
from
mr.
keating's
speech
at
page
8324
congressional
record,
and
i
would
like
to
see
if
there's
anything
murky
in
this
particular
phrase.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
reading
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
have
no
doubt
it's
a
legislative
history.
it's
almost
as
unsatisfactory
as
the
legislation
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
i
may
have
to
depend
on
your
own
later
on.
the
fact
is
that,
here,
i
can
see
no
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
understand
that.
i
have
no
right
to
object
even
though
i
have
to.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that
when
representative
keating
stated
on
the
floor,
it
required
in
the
case
congressional
hearings,
investigations,
virtual
agreement
between
all
three
branches
of
the
government.
and
then,
when
he
said
the
next
sentence
without
any
interpolation,
in
court
proceedings
that
requires
approval
of
both
the
prosecutor
in
the
court,
there,
whatever
murkiness
made
maybe
elsewhere,
i
don't
see
any
murkiness.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
perhaps
--
perhaps
i
could
come
back
to
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
can't
find
the
thing
at
the
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
very
well.
i
have
not
surrendered
on
the
legislation
at
all.
i
merely
brought
out
my
rear
guard
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
now,
sir
--
and
now,
sir,
of
course,
i
bring
up
the
attorney
general
as
my
last
witness,
because
on
september
13,
shortly
after
the
passage
of
this
law,
the
attorney
general
said,
talking
about
immunity
and
talking
about
the
immunity
before
grand
juries,
“it
will
be
granted
by
a
federal
district
judge.”
this
appeared
at
page
43
of
my
brief.
now,
i
have
considered
in
my
brief
that
he
isn't
bound
here
by
his
statement
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
actually,
the
court
denies,
yes.
judge
weinfeld
said
he
isn't
granting
immunity.
he
should
always
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
it
makes
sense.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
right.
now,
may
i
point
out
to
your
honor,
two
things?
first,
of
course,
the
direction
to
testify,
that
could
not
have
been
intended
by
representative
keating
or
the
attorney
general
or
anyone
else
but
that's
an
inherent
power
of
the
court
in
its
relationship
to
a
grand
jury.
the
court
only
has
the
power
to
supervise
to
the
grand
jury.
to
direct
the
witness
is
a
condition
to
contempt
proceeding.
there
must
be
something
else
intended
and
that
can
only
be
the
grant
of
immunity.
now,
when
the
attorney
general
said
in
the
speech
i
referred
to
will
be
granted
by
a
federal
district
judge.
his
preceding
sentence
next
to
the
last
was,
“the
immunity
will
be
granted
under
the
new
law.”
and
when
he
talks
about
this,
he
said,
“it”,
the
immunity,
will
be
granted
by
a
federal
district
judge
after
advised
by
the
attorney
general.
advice,
that
wasn't
the
position
they
took
on
--
took
in
the
court
below.
their
position
was
that
the
court
had
to
grant
immunity
if
they
ask
for
it
in
a
national
security
case.
we
say
their
words
are
correct.
all
they
were
supposed
to
do
is
give
advice.
now,
i
don't
want
to
move
too
far
on
this
--
on
the
statutory
construction
but
i'm
still
concerned
about
the
constitutional
aspect.
surprising
to
say,
i
think
whether
we
take
a
language
of
the
statute
in
the
reference
of
the
word
"application”
without
limitation,
and
the
reference
to
the
word
upon
order
and
that
shallow
order,
either
we
are
correct
on
our
construction
of
the
statute
in
the
court
below
is
an
error.
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
say
it's
no.
they
really
don't
concede
it.
judge
weinfeld
had
doubted
the
constitutionality
and
the
commentators
have
also
as
in
constitutionality
of
the
whole
congressional
part
of
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
constitutional
issue
because
that
is
so
important
here.
i
said
before
that
we
felt
that
the
minority
view
when
there
were
four
justices
in
that
minority
in
1896
in
brown
against
walker
was
the
correct
view
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
compulsory
testimony
could
not
be
required
under
immunity
act
whatever
bargain
might
be
made
between
witness
and
government,
whatever
voluntary
bargain.
it
is
a
hard
--
a
difficult
burden
of
course
to
take
on
all
the
regulatory
statutes
and
to
argue
that
all
of
them
are
unconstitutional
and
that
is
–
would
be
the
burden
of
our
arguments
that's
carried
forward.
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
carry
that
argument
here
for
two
reasons.
first
is
that
we
will
indicate
brown
against
walker
is
not
really
the
authority
that
it
appears
to
be
in
the
government's
brief,
because
of
the
peculiar
fact
situation
there
and
i
think
it's
known
to
the
members
of
the
court
which
i
will
recite
briefly.
secondly,
because
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
matters
of
economic
regulations
as
which
there
are
different
standard
rules
and
principles,
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
problem
of
--
what
our
first
amendment
rights
and
whether
ultimately,
our
claim
of
the
first
amendment
rights
will
be
found
to
move
to
the
level
of
rights
which
are
subject
to
regulation
–
reasonable
regulation
even
upon
the
first
amendment,
then
this
pose
of
the
fact
that
they
are
our
first
amendment
right
and
not
economic
problems
that
are
under
the
discussion
here.
and
secondly,
that
in
this
particular
field,
in
the
year
1955,
and
i've
read
even
in
the
years
1947
to
1955,
maybe
in
the
years
1959
and
1960,
the
sanctions
which
are
operative
against
the
political
dissent
are
so
severe,
governmental
private,
federal
and
state,
group
and
organizational,
that
one
cannot
say
that
a
guarantee
against
the
immunity
from
prosecution
really
protects
them
if
one
wants
reality
to
guide
decisions.
now,
i
come
down
to
my
phrase,
what
did
brown
against
walker
involve?
as
the
court
knows,
i
think
it
involved
an
auditor
at
the
allegany
railroad
who
was
called
before
a
grand
jury
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
determine
not
whether
he
committed
any
crime
but
whether
the
railroad
got
an
unlawful
rebate.
this
--
this
court,
the
court
here
in
analyzing
his
approach
who
is
represented
by
counsel,
a
very
distinguished
for
railway
order,
a
james
c.
carter
of
the
new
york
bar,
and
mr.
carter
wrote
a
brilliant
brief
on
the
subject
of
the
fifth
amendment.
there
was
only
one
mistake
i
think
in
the
brief
that
he
somewhat
exaggerated
when
he
suggested
that
this
railway
order
was
in
any
danger,
but
the
examples
he
took
of
the
danger
for
the
railway
order
indicates
the
differences
between
that
case
and
ours.
he
suggested
perhaps
an
auditing
record
divulged
by
the
auditor
which
showed
that
the
auditor,
humble
employee
was
in
a
certain
status
at
a
certain
time
where
there
was
money
embezzled
or
a
murder
had
taken
place.
and
so,
that
might
furnish
a
chain
of
circumstances
leading
to
his
conviction
for
the
state
crime.
now,
obviously,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case,
this
was
stretching
even
on
a
memo
which
deserves
very
wide
stretching
for
the
protection
of
--
of
defendant
and
witnesses
very
far.
there
was
no
danger
to
the
witness
in
that
case.
it
was
clearly
as
the
expression
that
yield
protecting
the
corporation
or
fronting
for
the
corporation.
and
then
deal
what
the
court
did
to
corporation
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
hale
against
henkel
and
the
decision
which
followed,
we
can
understand
how
this
particular
case
was
decided.
nevertheless,
there
was
this
very
strong
dissent,
but
i
suggest
as
i
do
in
my
hearings
as
i
do
in
my
briefs
that
this
was
a
terrible
case
and
an
unfortunate
one
for
us
to
have
to
follow
here
today
and
elsewhere
in
which
to
decide
some
important
constitutional
issue
as
a
privilege,
because
as
the
court
knows,
the
privilege
was
born
in
a
period
of
the
protection
of
political
and
religious
defense
in
puritans
in
england.
it
was
carried
forward
here,
almost
imperceptibly
without
even
being
in
various
english
statutes
which
contained
many
other
rights
because
it
was
assumed
to
be
a
necessity
for
democracy.
it
was
carried
forth
in
our
bill
of
rights
which
as
the
court
know
would
make
a
condition
to
the
ultimate
adaption
of
the
constitution.
and
i'm
unable
in
assessing
to
distinguish
here
between
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
ninth
amendment,
the
ultimate
repository
of
the
people's
rights
that
all
of
these
things
were
intertwined
as
the
fight
which
were
the
conditions
to
the
adaption
of
the
constitution.
now,
in
this
particular
area,
what
everyone
may
say
about
regulation
of
railroads,
or
antitrust
regulation,
when
you
get
a
real
case
of
political
dissent,
are
we
going
to
be
bound
by
the
statement
made
in
the
case
like
brown
against
walker,
or
must
not
the
most
liberal
approach
be
used
to
the
interpretation
of
these
constitutional
provision?
is
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
have
to
remember
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
queen,
the
historic
argument
of
the
privilege
and
that
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
the
same
case,
are
we
not
to
remember
that
the
history
of
the
privilege
was
intertwined
with
that
of
the
first
amendment?
because
what
everyone
may
say,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
position
taken
by
the
puritans
in
fighting
against
the
oath
ex
officio
was
not
a
position
taken
against
the
tortures
which
the
attorney
general
now
ascribes
the
privilege.
it
was
not
a
question
protecting
innocent
puritans
as
the
attorney
general
suggests
in
one
of
his
brief.
i
carry
them
to
which
one,
whether
puritans
were
guilty
or
innocent
was
not
important
because
guilt
or
innocence
doesn't
exist
when
one
discuss
talks
in
the
field
of
politics
or
political
dissent.
you
have
not
guilt
or
innocence
for
the
problem
of
rights.
the
right
to
political
dissent
was
the
right,
which
lifts
the
oath
ex
officio
and
then
the
right
which
must
destroy
this
immunity
law
today.
now,
i
will
not
go
into
the
detailed
history
of
the
privilege
which
we
have
given
on
our
brief,
which
the
court
had
shown
such
awareness
of.
one
may
say
in
a
sense
that
the
privilege
after
being
--
after
being
a
mark
of
dishonor
for
so
many
years
as
a
result
of
the
publicity
put
out
by
various
forces
in
government
and
the
press
has
risen
to
a
new
high
and
the
result,
i
think
of
two
forces
in
this
country,
one
thing,
griswold,
to
whom
we
owe
so
much
for
his
historical
study,
and
the
other
that
worked
for
this
court
in
the
last
term.
here,
we
have
for
the
first
time
the
privilege
lifted
to
that
level
of
respectability,
which
is
discerned
unless
history
has
to
be
disregarded
contrary
of
the
warning
by
the
chief
justice
and
judge
magruder
in
the
maffie
case
in
the
first
circuit.
and
here
is
our
chance
to
protect
the
privilege
in
the
area
in
which
it
was
intended
and
that
as
i
think
is
the
court's
function.
now,
i
have
discussed
this
in
terms,
not
in
terms
of
the
sanctions
which
officers
have
yet,
which
was
really
the
burden
of
our
argument
in
the
court
below,
but
in
terms
of
why
the
privilege
prohibits
compulsory
deals
with
people
when
you're
dealing
with
first
amendment
rights.
but
i
want
to
turn
to
the
second
point
of
this
argument
because
it
tells
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
would
say
at
least
first
amendment
right
if
the
court
--
if
the
justice
will
remember,
i
think
it
applies
to
everything.
i
don't
think
i
should
limit
it
to
first
amendment
right
because
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
must
contain
the
most
literal
meaning
and
the
most
liberal
construction
that
it
permits,
namely,
compulsory
bargains
in
any
field
are
unconstitutional.
but
if
there
is
a
reluctance
as
there
always
is
despite
(inaudible)
also
decided
in
1896
by
brown
against
walker.
if
there's
a
reluctance
to
recognize
a
new
situation
which
requires
an
uncovering
of
the
statutes,
at
least
i
say,
in
the
area
where
the
privilege
was
created,
let's
give
it
its
full
meaning.
let's
wait
until
an
economic
regulatory
statute
comes
to
the
court
and
then
decide
that
issue.
i
have
a
heavy
burden
and
i
think
i'm
sustained
by
both
law
and
morality
here,
but
if
a
heavy
burden
here
in
the
attack
against
brown
against
walker
and
i
don't
want
to
attempt
to
invalidate
every
regulatory
statute
in
the
field
of
economic
regulations.
i
think
i've
answered
the
court's
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
would
say
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
say
particularly
in
the
field
of
first
amendment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
think
i
could
say
if
i
were
the
court,
just
taking
that
position
for
the
moment,
that
we
will
not
pass
upon
the
problem
of
economic
regulatory
statutes
which
don't
involve
matter
--
they
don't
involve
matters
of
political
dissent.
we
will
only
decide
here
one
issue.
in
the
area
where
the
privilege
had
its
origin,
there,
we
think
clearly
compulsory
bargains
are
improper.
the
kind
of
reasonable
regulation
that
we
think
is
permitted
on
the
statutes
of
economic
regulations,
we
will
not
apply
to
the
first
amendment
area.
i
think
a
distinction
can
be
made
if
the
court
wants
to
and
particularly
because
that's
the
area
which
is
necessary.
i'm
not
sure
it's
practically
necessary
in
the
field
of
economic
regulation.
it
may
be
a
literal
reading
of
the
constitution
as
i
read
it,
but
the
practical
necessities
for
it
do
not
exist
there.
the
first
amendment
will
not
be
destroyed
and
that's
what
i
think
we
have
to
protect
here,
unless
we
are
to
say
that
the
privilege
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
first
amendment,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
do
that.
until
have
i
--
without
--
without
getting
your
honors
agreement,
i've
made
the
point
here
that
i
think
that
the
distinction
can
be
made
if
one
said
that
at
least
in
the
area
where
the
privilege
was
created,
the
first
amendment,
we
will
not
--
we
will
insist
upon
a
little
reading
of
the
constitution.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
not.
i
--
you
remember
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
no,
no,
everything
is
not.
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
one
subject,
economic
regulation
and
other
subjects
in
the
field
of
what
we
call
public
crime.
now,
what
is
sedition
to
one
person
may
very
well
be
a
first
amendment
problem
to
another.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
your
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
but
i'm
--
of
course
it
may
not
be
a
saboteur
case.
it
may
actually
be
a
first
amendment
case
post
in
terms
of
sabotage.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
and
i
will
answer
you,
sir
that
i
was
not
prepared
to
take
on
all
economic
regulatory
statutes
but
my
view
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
that
it
prohibits
a
compulsory
bargain
in
any
area.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
so
and
it
seems
to
me
i
may
have
to
come
--
fall
back
on
the
broader
attack
against
brown
against
walker
and
say
that
in
no
area
can
immunity
be
compulsory
given
and
then
compel
to
testify
against
himself.
that
may
very
well
be
the
sound
of
their
argument
on
the
critical
analysis
that
you're
giving
and
i
don't
withdraw
from
it,
perhaps,
and
i
have
not
taken
the
easier
burden
when
i
suggest
that
the
first
amendment
area
is
a
preferred
area
to
fight
this
out.
and
i
therefore
withdraw
from
that
position.
i
move
to
that
position.
i
prefer
to
say
that
all
immunity
statutes
on
analysis
are
unconstitutional
if
they
compel
testimony
that
no
immunity
statute,
i
would
say,
is
unconstitutional
if
it
represents
a
voluntary
bargain
made
between
government
and
the
witness.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
correct.
now,
i
turn
to
what
i
had
thought
was
the
most
important
one.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
say
that
immunity
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
may
have
answered
you
too
quickly,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
understand
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
you
have
inquired
--
i
do
not
concede
that
in
any
area,
immunity
can
be
enforced
and
a
witness
compelled
to
testify.
i
do
agree
that
a
witness
can
make
a
contract
with
the
government
where
they
use
the
term
“contract
or
bargain
or
arrangement,”
under
which
he
testified
pursuant
to
an
agreement
to
immunize
him
and
he
thereupon
receives
whatever
the
immunity
is
the
great
take.
and
now,
may
i
turn
to
the
thought
which
i
have
thought
was
the
most
important
part
of
my
argument
but
as
usual,
life
moves
on
in
these
arguments
and
that
is
the
point
made
by
the
chief
judge
below,
the
point
which
we
have
made
now
for
several
years.
and
that,
in
a
sense,
doesn't
require
--
doesn't
require
my
--
this
going
brown
against
walker.
and
--
and
i
think
that
the
court
understands
that
whenever
my
right
may
be
to
criticize
a
court,
this
court
and
the
court
against
brown
against
walker,
i
have
indicated
a
very
realistic
understanding
of
why
brown
against
walker
was
decided.
it
was
a
very
bad
framework
for
a
decision
on
this
constitutional
issue,
but
i
refer
to
the
point
made
by
chief
judge
clark
at
page
59
of
its
opinion
when
he
said
this.
first,
he
took
our
first
point
which
i've
just
been
discussing
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
reed,
when
he
said
that
this
statute
undermines
and
so
far
forth
nullifies
one
of
the
basic
differences
between
our
justice
and
that
of
resistance
we
condemn,
namely,
the
principle
of
the
individual
should
not
to
be
forced
to
condemn
himself.
that
is
the
point
which
i
just
made
well
or
poorly.
the
second
point
is
a
distinct
point.
practically,
as
we
know,
no
formal
immunity
can
protect
the
minority
deviator
from
society
dooms
when
he
departs
its
norms.
and
his
third
point
is,
and
realistically
viewed,
there
is
much
in
the
defendant's
contention
that
at
the
end
of
the
road
is
a
charge
of
perjury
supported
by
the
oath
of
the
renegade
or
a
paid
informer,
this
is
chief
judge
clark.
and
as
to
the
second
of
these
points,
our
brief
elaborates
and
i
wonder
whether
it
is
really
necessary
to
go
into
it
fully,
the
kinds
of
sanctions
operative
today
in
the
area
of
political
dissent.
we're
not
now
discussing
whether
they're
right
or
wrong
but
whether
if
they
exist.
the
fact
that
in
the
areas
of
government
employment,
a
defense
employment,
a
private
employment,
people
are
excluded
because
of
their
political
views,
views
which
--
which
they
will
be
compelled
under
this
statute
to
reveal
publicly
and
grand
jury
taken
and
congressional
committee
cases
privately
for
the
moment
in
grand
jury
cases,
publicly
in
court
cases.
we
point
out
that
the
areas
of
extending
government
control
are
sold
many
today.
now,
what
we
really
have,
almost
a
close
society
of
the
kind
we
had
at
medieval
days
when
each
man
was
dependent,
not
upon
his
ability
as
an
individual,
the
old
pioneer
tradition
to
this
country
but
was
dependent
upon
his
fellows,
on
his
trade
union,
his
housing
development,
his
social
club,
dependent
for
his
everyday
livelihood
and
for
his
existence.
and
the
terrible
things
that
we've
been
through
in
the
last
10
years
when
we
saw
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
thrown
out
of
a
parent-teachers
association,
and
we
saw
other
witnesses
their
house
were
stoned,
compelled
to
move
with
their
children.
these
are
the
things
that
we
talk
about
that
could
not
exist
in
brown
against
walker
where
the
order
went
back
to
him
desperate
cheerfully
after
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
these
are
the
things
that
have
destroyed
people
today.
this
is
what
we
say
we
need
protection
against,
and
the
government
has
used
a
marvelous
expression
here,
one
that
i
think
will
play
it
for
the
rest
of
this
policy
prophylaxis.
imagine
calling
this
prophylaxis,
destroying
people's
lives
in
so
many
areas
that
have
no
place
to
go.
but
when
they
talked
about
areas
to
which
prophylaxis
is
applied,
that
assumes
that
there
is
an
area
in
existence
where
people
can
go.
well,
if
we
are
to
be
honest
and
we
must
as
lawyers
and
judges
and
arguers
drawn
at
in
many
areas
in
which
people
who
had
dissensions
can
go
today,
there
are
not
many
aspects
of
life
in
which
even
private
employment
where
they
can
live.
and
i
pass
over
for
the
moment,
the
fact
that
in
the
end
of
this
road,
aside
from
the
point
made
by
judge
clark,
the
end
of
the
road
is
a
detention
and
a
concentration
camp,
called
a
detention
camp,
but
i
must
have
used
other
words,
under
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
if
the
attorney
general,
in
a
period
of
national
emergency
declared
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
says
that
he
believes
that
a
person
is
guilty
of
espionage.
well,
can
that
really
be
suggested
by
the
government
that
all
of
these
sanctions
of
things
we're
immunized
against,
they
don't
mean
that
the
man
who
had
declared
a
security
risk
and
who
admits
it
under
a
grand
jury
--
a
grand
jury
proceeding
that
information
going
to
the
fbi
or
a
congressional
committee
proceeding
or
otherwise
that
that
man
is
going
to
go
to
the
passport
office
on
8th
street
and
get
a
passport.
they
don't
mean
that
that's
a
privilege
he's
entitled
to.
they
don't
mean
that
he
doesn't
have
to
register
under
the
communist
control
act.
they
don't
mean
that
he
can
--
that
he
can
sign
an
affidavit
now
even
though
he's
a
communist
and
be
an
officer
of
the
labor
union.
all
of
these
sanctions
are
going
to
operate
regardless
of
the
fictitious
immunity
given
under
the
statute
and
the
government
knows
it,
and
the
term
“prophylaxis”
is
a
very
term
in
a
way
because
what
happens
in
prophylaxis,
you
destroy
the
bacteria
or
the
germs
in
the
body.
unfortunately,
we're
talking
here
of
human
beings.
we're
talking
about
the
people
that'll
be
destroyed,
very
good
term.
now,
we
have
discussed
here
incidentally
aside
from
the
federal
governmental
sanctions
which
they
may
say
are
civil
but
which
have
risen
to
such
a
level
and
are
so
multifarious
as
the
word
civil
is
no
longer
appropriate.
they
are
destructive
whether
you
call
them
on
civil
or
criminal.
quite
aside
from
that,
we
have
pointed
out
here
that
there
are
state
laws
that
are
operative,
and
that
those
state
laws
will
apply
in
the
present
case
and
that
there's
no
power
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
to
stop
state
bodies
where
there
are
legislative
committees
and
subpoenaing
people
after
they
have
revealed
their
crimes
before
a
federal
congressional
committee
or
whether
they
are
--
or
whether
they
are
witnesses
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
who
in
accordance
with
the
policy
now
in
compliance
of
cooperation
with
the
--
between
federal
and
state
authorities
in
this
period
of
subversive
activities,
a
high-powered
cooperation,
there
is
an
intercommunication
so
that
what
goes
to
one
place
may
very
well
go
to
the
other.
we
have
pointed
that
we
have
made
three
points
here
and
time
will
not
permit
me
to
them,
first,
the
court
on
reevaluating
the
case
is
dealing
with
state
and
federal
crimes
will,
i
think,
agree
with
my
analysis
that
murdock
not
withstanding
again
because
of
the
facts
in
that
case.
the
double
sovereignty
rule
is
not
the
proper
rule
in
this
country
and
that
the
federal
government
must
take
cognizance
of
the
possibility
of
state
criminal
prosecution.
secondly,
that
it
cannot
be
given
to
a
single
state
--
a
federal
prosecutor
the
power
to
enjoin
a
state
prosecution
of
an
individual.
whatever
may
be
the
rules
of
supersedure
on
the
field,
you
can't
give
the
united
states
attorney
the
right
to
suspend
state
laws.
and
thirdly,
that
the
(inaudible)
to
where
the
congress
even
intended
it
here,
although
i
admit
that
that's
an
ambiguous
aspect
to
this
legislation.
i
want
to
save
my
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
boudin.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
whether
it
is
worth,
the
argument
made
in
congress,
in
this
session
were
very
different
from
those
historically
made
and
adjust
themselves
to
the
point
which
i've
made.
secondly,
i
don't
know
if
any
english
immunity
law
which
the
court
has
upheld
as
requiring
compulsory
confession,
there
may
be
such,
but
i
don't
know
of
any.
that
(inaudible)
which
is
referred
to
here
wasn't
as
i
recall
it
and
defeated
after
lord
hardwicke,
not
making
the
speech
which
the
government
puts
in
his
brief
said,
“that
the
public
has
not
a
right
to
require
from
any
man
they
should
betray
himself
because
every
man
may
plead.
he's
accepted
from
that
demand
by
the
public
faith.”
the
contrary
to
the
argument
made
by
the
government,
the
government
began
by
denying
that
section
(c)
is
an
appeal
to
the
court's
discretion.
today,
it
almost
moved
to
the
point
of
denying
that
(a)
and
(b),
the
english
congressional
committees
gives
the
court
any
latitude
despite
the
use
of
the
word
"approval".
now,
i
suggest
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
a
court
have
a
greater
power
of
discretion
in
connection
with
grand
juries
because
historically,
that's
in
the
court's
power
rather
than
the
contrary
with
respect
to
the
congressional
committee.
thirdly,
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
burdick
against
the
united
states,
the
case
which
was
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
pardon
withheld
not
compellable,
236
u.s.
fourthly,
the
question
here
is
not
whether
dennis
is
right.
the
question
is
whether
a
compulsory
confession
can
operate
to
a
person's
injury
not
whether
congress
has
the
power
by
testimony
outside
of
its
own
to
restrict
him
activities
and
put
him
in
jail
and
oppose
other
sanctions
against
him.
now,
finally,
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
the
reality
of
the
situation
which
didn't
exist
in
1896,
didn't
exist
in
1857
or
in
1862
where
the
time
of
any
of
the
lords.
we
have
gone
through
a
terrible
period
here
and
neither
powerful
dramatically
nor
do
i
have
to
as
the
court
knows,
whether
it's
been
happening
in
the
last
eight
years
in
this
country,
we're
going
through
a
loyalty
oath
and
acquisitions
and
congressional
committee
hearing,
a
terrible
thing.
no
matter
what
side
you're
on,
we
all
recognize
the
destruction
it's
made
to
men's
lives,
suicides
or
many
in
this
area
and
to
men's
souls.
and
i
suggest
here
that
this
court
which
has
began
the
process
of
stopping
the
destruction
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
destruction
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
an
opportunity
today
not
to
solve
the
whole
problem,
obviously
not,
but
to
play
an
important
part
in
accordance
with
the
historic
function
in
and
of
the
courts
under
the
first
and
the
fifth
amendment
of
article
3
in
protecting
our
civil
liberties
by
saying
at
least
here,
we
will
stop.
we
will
not
let
a
man
destroy
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth.
that's
the
only
function
i
ask
this
court
to
perform
today.
thank
you.
