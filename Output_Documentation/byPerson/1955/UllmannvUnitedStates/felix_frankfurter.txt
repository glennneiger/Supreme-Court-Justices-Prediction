justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
i
caught
what
--
in
your
view
is
irrelevant
in
your
request
to
judge
weinfeld
who
examined
the
grand
jury
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
derived
that
from
the
minutes
from
what
the
--
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
in
charge
told
the
grand
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
witnesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
those
minutes
--
assuming
he
had
grant
your
motion,
would–
would
the
minutes
have
to
be
drawn
over
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
before
you
do
that
mr.
boudin,
may
i
trouble
you
to
help
me
know
where
i
can
see
precisely
what
this
witness
was
asked,
his
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
just
want
to
know
if
--
and
the
order
is
to
answer
the
question
set
forth
on
pages
2,
3
and
4.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
say,
“and
all
of
the
purpose
it
uses?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
at
page
44?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
amendment
pursuant
to
the
provisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
this
relevancy
is
--
before
we
come
back
to
the
grand
jury
room
and
then
these
questions
were
propounded
to
be
answered
in
some
other
questions
that
are
not
plainly
repetitive
for
me
to
know.
and
then
i
set
out
in
the
application.
i
myself
thought
it
was
irrelevant.
we
have
to
go
through
and
all
over
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
--
or
would
he
(voice

–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
would
be
guilty
in
court
of
contempt
if
he
--
what
i
read
is
that
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you're
resting
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
and
i
want
to
hear
it
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
–
it
bares
on
from
my
point
of
view
the
function
of
a
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
merely
that.
and
perhaps
the
only
difference
in
those
cases
is
this,
namely,
the
whole
function
of
who
gives
immunity
is
involved
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
it's
not
involved
in
those
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
what
it
is
that
the
judge
is
empowered
to
purge
by
his
traditional
order
used
to
be
irrelevant
with
his
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
neutral
words
that
judges
are
filing
that
the
immunity
--
some
of
the
immunity
covers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
are
you
going
to
give
me
bill
of
particulars
for
that
reasons?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix

and
what

is
that?

(inaudible)
justice

why
--
why
is
that?
why
not,
why
didn't
he
put
the
u.s.
attorney
and
the
attorney
general.
justice

well,
if
you
--
if
you
read
the
whole
pleadings,
in
those
provisions
with
a
subsequent
(inaudible)
to
the
questions
presented
by
the
revenue
(voice

--
justice

if
you
read

i
think
i
might
disclose
to
you
my
--
justice

--
i
mean
why
i
shouldn't
--
i
wish
to
report
to
the
committee
(inaudible)
i
think
mr.
keating's
speech
is
equally
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
which
--
which
part
are
you
reading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
difficulty
derives
from
the
fact
that
in
both
the
report
to
this
proceeding.
in
one
phrase,
one
casual
issue
where
they
talked
about
the
investiture
aspect
in
the
court's
relation
with
--
and
if
that
language
--
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
like
notice
to
a
conclusion.
i'm
not
saying
i
reject
your
argument.
i'm
merely
now
examining
the
evidence
to
the
conclusion
that
it
support.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
how
it's
unsatisfactory.
it
doesn't
state
if
it's
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
because
i
can
argue
the
legislation
your
position
much
more
clearly
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
a
hostile
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
haven't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
wouldn't
care
about
the
--
the
character
--
i
don't
--
i
think
it
will
be
–
would
help
the
court,
if
i
may
say
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
you
to
read
the
paragraph
in
which
it
includes
these
congressional
aspects
and
paragraph
into
the
courthouse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we'll
see
why
it
says
murky.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
is
the
often
illustration
why
counsel
goes
first
to
the
legislative
history
instead
of
first
going
to
the
legislative
history
and
see
how
far
that
would
carry
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
mine
with
all
conviction,
it's
my
due
to
legislation
to
carry
it
further.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
arguing
that
this
is
not
and
i
have
to
be
informed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
--
of
course
the
court
has
to
order
it.
that's
not
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
what
is
it
that
needs
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
inform
the
ordering
immunity.
i
did
inform
you
at
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
an
essential
piece
of
machinery.
he
is
an
essential
function
for
the
effectuation
of
this
statute,
but
the
question
is
whether
he
has
discretionary
power
to
withhold
or
whether
he's
a
merely
ministerial
officers
so
that
it
could
be
mandamus
or
whether
he'd
function
therefore
in
restrictive
for
the
relevance
of
the
question
and
not
to
the
–
to
the
granting
or
withholding
assuming
the
questions
relevant.
those
are
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
establish
one
thing,
then
i
know
exactly
what
the
answer
to
my
questions
about
vesting
that
power
of
the
court
if
the
answer
is
another
reason,
i'm
troubled
with
all
of
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
the
court
can
see
is
the
government
deemed
irrelevant
for
its
position
with
this
argument
whether
if
these
were
a
congressional
multiple
direct
investigation
that
the
judge
is
not
dealing
in
his
state
of
office.
suppose
--
let
me
say
that's
not
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
weinfeld
made
a
distinction
between
the
function
of
the
court
in
reference
to
the
investigation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
situations
--
are
there
only
some
situations,
first
amendment
and
regulatory
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
this
whole
grand
jury
proceeding
growing
out
of
the
saboteur
landing
and
the
questions
were
up
for
the
witnesses
who
were
called
and
they
refused
to
answer
within
privilege.
you'd
have
to
make
a
different
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
first
amendment,
do
we
carry
the
first
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
the
sabotaging
as
i'm
telling
you
that
is
not
two
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
regulation?
no.
is
it
first
amendment?
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
could
happen
to
the
court
if
it
isn't
bothered
by
brown
and
walker
even
though
its
origin
was
different
with
the
first
amendment
situation.
now,
was
there
an
inquiry
of
alleged
espionage
of
the
first
amendment
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
fully
agree
with
you
with
the
power
to
which
mr.
carter
presented
that
situation.
i
don't
supposed
there
ever
was
any,
things
that
we
--
purpose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
not
familiar
to
us.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
differentiation
between
lawfully
is
to
me
a
very
difficult
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
you're
asking
this
court
to
read
the
fifth
amendment
literally
without
any
qualification
unless
immunity
is
different
from
prosecution
thereof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
you
would
ask
the
court
to
reconsider
brown
and
walker
and
refused
to
read
the
fifth
and
ask
the
court
to
read
the
fifth
amendment
literally
and
not
to
interpolate
or
ask
to
it
by
implication.
no
question
shall
be
compelled
if
the
witness
against
himself
in
criminal
cases
unless
he'd
be
given
immunity
from
criminal
prosecutions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barber,
i
suppose
you
are
suggesting
that
the
presidential
bargaining
--
presidential
bargaining
business
deal
with
this
problem.
is
my
recollection
was
correct,
that
a
party
requires
acceptance
that
the
parties
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
just
as
that
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
to
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
does
goes
often.
what
about
the
general
amnesty
statute,
one
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
congress
passed
general
amnesty
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
except
as
to
power
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
congress
can
view
on
this
problem
by
general
amnesty
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
they're
subject
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
one
of
the
statute
they're
supposed
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

that
the
power
of
the
congress
to
pass
at
the
amnesty
is
ambiguous
to
surrender
to
withhold
history
from
the
acceptance
of
the
same
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
suppose
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
suggesting
that
it
wouldn't
--
may
have
had
power
of
congress
to
pass
that
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
suppose
that
general
amnesty
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
be
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
hasn't
done
--
congress
has
intervened
between
itself
in
the
controversies
of
the
act
and
the
action
(inaudible)
it
is
the
opposite
of
what
it
has
done
(inaudible)
and
therefore,
we
have
to
see
so
far
as
what
is
concerned,
what
power,
with
what
power
before
he's
charged.
the
impact
of
–
when
–
what
finally
happens
and
basing
to
what
congress
has
done,
i
think
i
answered
the
problem
of
what
--
where
in
this
court
comes
in.
but
the
court
places
its
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
suppose
the
congress
--
suppose
this
statute
had
said
in
words
and
the
court
–
and
if
the
court
shall,
within
its
discretion
the
congress
such
application
having
been
duly
made
issue
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
that
be
the
problem?
would
that
present
a
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
serious
problem
--
this
serious
problem
is
conferring
juries
upon
court
which
the
court
has
no
business
to
exercise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
suggest
for
the
purpose
that
you
cannot
separate,
you
cannot
discuss
(c)
without
discussing
(a)
and
(b),
and
seeing
whether
what
is
written
carries
with
its
differences
which
--
which
do
not
--
it
would
admit
the
series
of
questions
in
(a)
and
(b).
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
(c)
either
in
the
language
that
makes
it
entirely
different
and
if
you're
right
as
ultimately
that
at
the
ministerial
act
that
the
--
the
district
court
is
mandamus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
their
aim
in
the
language?
and
on
the
language
--
unless
the
language
is
very
explicit
to
suggest
the
--
to
understand
performance
that
the
district
court
will
see
what
is
the

if
the
language,
if
the
explicitness
of
the
language
and
the
purpose
of
that
in
this
consideration,
that
do
raise
a
question
there
and
either
do
not
raise
a
question

justice

by
ministerial,
i
would
draw
a
lot
of
ministerial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
we
know
how
to
--
is
--
the
argument
was
made
from
(inaudible)
justice
felix

you
have
a
right
to
say
that.
i
understand,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
spare
on
--
spare
on
this
aspect
to
recall
it,
congress
has
given
you
if
it's
to
say
that
he
did
say
approval
as
to
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
as
you
know,
i
don't
--
i
still
think
it's
murky.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
should
--
why
if
you
have
to
do
that
kind
of
crab
walking,
at
least
i
have
to
do
on
this
two
section.
why
should
the
congress?
what
reason
is
there
as
the
language
(inaudible)
what
reason
is
there
why
a
judgment
had
more
judges?
what's
giving
more
discretion
in
the
reference
to
congressional
demand
or
acquisition
is
there
with
the
attorney
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
to
contend
or
would
have
to
contend
that
immunity
extends
the
state,
the
potential
state
prosecution,
there's
another
individual
and
just
might
have
wanted
(inaudible)
whether
it's
desirable
to
this
plaintiff,
the
immunity
and
practices
administrated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barber,
you
--
you
have
to
get
the
court
in
somehow
a
grip
on
--
on
the
--
in
order
to
make
a
section
to
your
sanction
apart
from
the
congressional
power
to
overcome
this
intent
in
connection
with
this
(inaudible)
you
have
to
have
the
court
because
no
administrative
agency
nor
executive
agency
to
have
power
to
convict
for
contempt
but
is
the
(inaudible)
well,
you
have
to
get
the
court
(voice

--
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

it
must
make
--
this
and
in
doing
this
statute
in
its
entirety,
not
to
the
separate
rules,
of
course,
this
is
an
exemption
and
the
language
might
have
to
(inaudible)
it
is
not
the
accountable,
a
reading
of
the
entire
of
the
court
in
relation
to
a
senatorial
committee
or
the
senate.
think
of
a
court,
think
of
giving
a
power
and
a
power
to
a
court
to
exercise
the
different
judgment
from
that
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
attorney
general,
and
yet,
you
have
to
convince
the
court
when
it
comes
to
--
your
opinion,
the
attorney
general
of
the
court
must
be
obedient.
that's
when
it
gets
down
to,
to
the
practicality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm,
happy
to
--
i'm
happy
to
infer
this.you
do
not
need
to
think
an
argument
as
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
bound
--
i
don't
quite
see
the
relevance
of
this
because
if
i
accept
your
views,
it's
unreviewable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pages
--
justice
felix

--
that
come
from
such
explicitness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
–
i
suppose
what
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
what
you
meant
of
unimaginable
--
the
report
to
serve
by
this
(inaudible)
about
this
case.
you
don't
have
to
narrow
the
case
to
something
that
will
attract
the
conflict
of
man
kind
etcetera,
etcetera.
the
court
could
not
--
the
enforcement
are
not
depriving
something
that
(inaudible)
as
we
have
to,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that
anybody
as
attorney
general
once
you
gift
or
not
or
couldn't
give
any
--
draw
a
doctrine
that
would
--
would
indicate
in
(inaudible)
mind
as
he
had.
it
would
create
a
situation
that
you
wouldn't
leave
anything.
