before
you
move
on
to
the
conclusion
of
law,
what
are
we
to
understand
as
the
government's
position
in
regards
to
what
i
call
findings
of
fact,
do
you
challenge
any
of
them
or
all
of
them
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
very
--
are
you
going
to
point
out
which
ones
they
are
or
are
they
also
included
in
the
conclusions
of
law
or
--
or
they
not
count
to
be
segregates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
up
to
that
--
i
wish
be
assumed
and
i
--
i
do
assume
that
up
to
that
time,
up
to
2834,
you
do
not
challenge
that
the
findings
of
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
sustainable
and
justifiable
as
the
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
making
--
are
you
indicating
either
your
brief
or
your
argument
which
we
may
assume
under
attack
and
which
we
may
assume
is
the
starting
point
of
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
on
the
direction
if
the
french,
owner
or
the
process
to
all
the
patents
but
you
say
the
patent
is
useless
to
gain
profit
and
up
to
that
time
of
the
people
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
du
pont.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
submission
to
restriction
of
few
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
went
to
a
prior
art
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
words
of
the
secret
process
did
not
--
has
not
on
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
du
pont
take
any
active
measure,
that
is
this
company
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
worried
about
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
true,
is
there
any
overt
acts
on
du
pont's
part
with
reference
to
anybody
of
potential
competitors
other
than
what
you
are
arguing,
monopoly
tradition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
prevent
--
i
mean
take
the
shoe
prints
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
whether
they
like
to
prevent
its
plan
from
using
a
competitive
machinery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
it
was
exclusive
licensee
or
whatever
of
--
of
the
french
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
raising
a
legal
question.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
want
to
know
whether
as
a
matter
of
facts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
government
charge
or
anything
substantial.
if
anything
was
done
from
any
other
company
to
the
scale
of
this
finding,
discovering
an
effective
and
possible
formula
to
manufacture
it
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
challenging
those
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
was
olin
not
able?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
tried
to
--
inability
was
still
on
the
part
of
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
independently
found
the
secret
formula
without
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
construct
an
act.
apart
from
the
conventional
unfair
competition,
there's
an
unpatented
leeway
process
and
another
person
independently
without
utilizing
any
employee,
without
any
misconduct
--
any
misconduct,
independent
work
in
the
laboratory,
hits
upon
the
same
secret
process
and
doesn't
promote
it
under
the
name
that
misleads
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weston,
did
cellophane
replace
an
entire
commodity
expert
(inaudible)
serving
that
one
film
that
is
created,
a
new
model?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
its
kind
with
a
little
of
its
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
to
the
things
that
it
explained,
did
it
place
competitors
in
regard
the
functions?
did
that
market
shrink
from
the
commodity
of
this
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
--
there
was
--
there
were
commodities
that
served
the
function
that
cellophane
did
before
cellophane
didn't
appeal,
is
that
what
i'm
--
as
you
understand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
wrappings
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
particular
thing
that
cellophane
does
or
did,
that
that
has
to
persons,
that
has
to
people
who
conceded
it
as
giving
that
--
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
--
these
other
packaging
is
comparable
as
these
in
finding
280.
did
they
come
into
the
field
after
the
cellophane?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
indicate
them?
we
have
a
submission
date
to
determine
how
much
of
(inaudible)
as
the
cellophane
as
that
market
have.
in
other
words,
when
the
cellophane
increase,
the
market
of
those
who
are
competing
with
the
cellophane
would
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it
be
of
his
--
what
you
call
a
superior
quality
of
superior
(inaudible)q
is
that
relevant
to
your
--
to
your
mind
with
this
problem
as
i've
got
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
did
you
read
that
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weston,
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
raise
the
question
of
size
as
meaning
by
that,
the
extensive
demand
for
or
use
of
this
party
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
relevant
factor
in
your
field
for
adjudication
(inaudible).
if
it
is
in
short
by
way
of
contract?
suppose
instead
of
dealing
with
a
commodity
or
his
friend
has
just
had
and
used
all
over
the
united
states
resulting
to
mean
(inaudible)
suppose
it
had
been
a
commodity
which
only
the
power
of
the
wealth
can
be
--
can
be
deprived
so
that
the
--
the
market
in
restriction
to
american
species.
otherwise,
the
monopoly
position
of
--
in
your
view
unless
like
this,
would
the
legal
question
be
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
speaking
of
a
commodity
whether
it's
a
very
fine
--
something
that's
called
$10
unit,
therefore
it
involves
decision
instrument
instead
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
going
to
make
a
--
for
instance,
a
problem
--
for
instance,
as
a
matter
of
practical
or
a
special
kind
of
--
of
grace,
cigarette
or
what
you
see,
some
luxury
articles.
otherwise,
the
condition
would
say,
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
by
using
the
size
of
penetration,
the
economic
penetration
of
this
particular
commodity
is
a
relevant
fact
at
all
--
entered
at
all
into
your
calculations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
not
the
proper
size
of
a
luxury
trade
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
think
the
downfall
make
a
difference
whether
you're
dealing
with
a
commodity
that
has
the
national
market,
has
a
--
has
a
--
100%
would
buy
or
merely
50%,
100,000
would
buy,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
patent
for
it,
the
government
has
made
that
concession,
the
attorney
general
and
that
conferred
with
the
geographical
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true
of
aluminum?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
is
that
this
have
to
resort
when
go
straight
because
of
either
you
had
an
excluding
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
tell
us
what
they
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on,
you
find
(inaudible)
is
that
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
soon
as
they
buy
the
--
the
cellophane
from
du
pont.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
du
pont
itself
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
words
might
as
--
what
are
the
differences
in
appeal
in
buying
du
pont
cellophane
as
against
these
valued
products?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
shows,
finally
show
why
cigarettes
are
consented
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
maybe
not
that
fit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gessell,
can
you
tell
(inaudible)
what's
the
importance
of
the
manufacturing
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
would
at
the
time
maybe
an
unimportant
thing
as
to
determine
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
the
government
means
by
saying
by
mere
fact
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
lack
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
entry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weston,
what
--
the
decision
of
this
court
has
deemed
it
a
violation
of
the
sherman
law
and
the
owner
of
a
secret
process
to
give
the
exclusive
right
as
to
the
event
to
this
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
on
what
information
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
--
certainly,
what's
illegal
under
the
common
law
(inaudible)
justice

frankfurter
assuming
it's
an
appropriate
(inaudible)
time
and
circumstances
appropriate
with
the
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
if
there's
a
company
that
can
--
got
the
business
all
over
the
world
does
and
know
have
done
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
at
common
law.
that's
the
connection
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
common
law
may
have
made
inroads
under
common
law
but
i
do
not
know
(inaudible)
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
--
you'd
restrict
that

i'm
--
i'm
asking
because
it's
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
been
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
just
seems
that
it
was
an
exclusive
assignment,
that's
all
it
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
got
away
from
that.
what
--
do
you
say
that
patents
that
were
filed
by
the
