mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
fact
case,
a
case
which
we
come
before
you
on
now
with
the
concession
from
the
government
that
they
do
not
challenge
the
findings
of
fact.
the
difficulty
i
had
with
mr.
weston's
argument
was
a
very
real
difficulty
and
that
was
that
he
didn't
present
to
your
honors
what
this
record
shows
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
were
the
facts.
it
is
very
easy
to
develop
a
theory
of
monopolization.
i
supposed
in
any
industry,
if
one
can
select
a
fact
here,
a
half
fact
there,
a
quarter
truth
here
and
put
them
together
with
theory
and
surmise
but
we
litigated
these
issues
in
the
district
court.
these
arguments
were
made
advance
and
pressed.
there
were
witnesses
who
appeared
and
testified.
there
were
many,
many
documents
read,
studied
and
analyzed.
the
court
went
out
into
the
field
and
looked
at
these
products
being
sold,
examined
how
they
were
made
and
saw
the
actual
operations
of
the
marketplace.
and
we
had
buyers
and
we
had
sellers
who
came
and
said
that
this
is
not
the
way
the
industry
works,
that
is
--
where
the
government
says
it
is,
but
it
worked
in
a
different
way.
so,
that
my
theme
here
is
talk
to
the
court
today
about
the
facts.
and
my
argument
is
that
when
the
facts
of
this
industry
are
understood,
you
come
and
are
compelled
to
the
conclusion
that
this
complaint
was
properly
dismissed
below.
and
i
intend
in
every
way
i
know
how
to
bring
before
your
honors
what
is
in
this
eight
volumes
which
is
only
a
portion
of
the
record
below
and
which
it
took
weeks
and
weeks
and
days
of
trial
to
develop
with
examination
and
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
discovery,
discussion
of
individual
documents
and
bring
it
to
you
in
terms
of
these
findings
which
aren't
challenged
to
show
you
what
this
true
industry
position
is.
out
in
the
first
place,
let's
look
at
what
we
were
charged
with
because
that's
what
we
litigate,
we
had
a
complaint
and
we
tried
it
out.
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
page
6
of
volume
i
where
the
complaint
is
found,
you'll
see
a
recital
there
of
the
offenses
charged.
now,
this,
i
say
to
you,
is
the
starting
point
for
this
analysis.
the
government
concedes
there
was
no
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
the
government
concedes
there
is
no
attempt
to
monopolize.
the
government
concedes
there
is
no
monopolization
as
to
caps
and
bands,
another
issue
in
this
case
that
we've
litigated,
and
the
government
has
dropped
all
of
paragraph
22
(e)
with
respect
to
restraints
on
the
distribution
side
of
this
case
as
to
which
there
are
many
unchallenged
findings
and
the
record
isn't
even
here.
so
we
are
in
this
court
now
with
a
very
specific
single
charge,
that
is
the
charge
of
monopoly
power,
the
charge
of
market
control.
you
will
see
in
22
(a)
the
definition
of
the
power
over
price
which
was
alleged.
it
was
alleged
that
we
had
a
power
to
fix
and
then
train
arbitrary
noncompetitive
prices
in
terms
of
sale.
and
that
was
what
we
litigated.
and
you
will
see
in
(b)
and
(c)
power
to
exclude.
and
it
is
said
on
the
top
of
page
7
that
these
powers
have
become
self-sustaining
and
self-perpetuating.
now,
the
court
understands,
i
hope,
that
there
are
no
agreements
here
that
are
attacked
to
be
stricken
down.
there
is
no
practice
in
terms
of
any
trade
or
commerce
or
conduct
which
is
attacked.
we
are
there
with
that
position
and
this
case
is
a
challenge
to
that
position
on
the
ground
that
it
gives
us
as
of
the
date
of
the
complaint,
1947,
power
over
price
and
power
to
exclude
and
those
are
the
issues
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
those
agreements,
your
honor
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
this
charge
covered
with
--
the
complaint
was
filed
in
1947
and
the
charge
says
that
we
have
monopolized
and
are
presently
monopolizing,
so
i
take
it,
it
covers
the
period
from
1923
to
1947.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
when
first
agreement
was
made
and
when
we
entered
the
business.
but
the
--
the
issue
that
comes
to
the
court
in
my
judgment
is
whether
or
not
our
position
is
a
position
of
monopoly.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
only
if
it
--
you
first
determine
that
it
is
the
position
of
monopoly,
then
the
question
of
how
we
achieved
it
becomes
quite
relevant.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
section
1.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes,
your
honor,
for
this
reason
that
they
must
show
because
we're
not
litigating
section
1
questions
here.
they
must
show
that
that
agreement
had
a
causal
relation
and
effect
on
our
position.
you
must
show
that
that
agreement
was
one
of
the
contributing
factors
to
our
position.
the
court
explicitly
found
it
was
not.
so
if
i
take
your
assumption,
which
your
honor
appreciates
i
--
i
don't
agree
with,
that
there
was
a
division
of
territory.
the
case
showed
clear
that
that
agreement
could
not
and
did
not
contribute
in
anyway
to
our
position,
for
reasons
which
i
intend
to
cover
in
my
argument.
and
i
say
they
must
show
that
causal
relation.
but
starting
first
with
our
position,
which
is
the
question
of
attack,
i
submit
that
that
is
a
question
of
fact
which
has
to
be
determined
by
normal
fact
finding
processes
and
that
these
issues
of
power
cannot
be
speculated
about
but
they
must
be
proven.
the
fact
that
we
have
68%
of
the
cellophane
business
or
75%
depending
on
whether
you
look
at
it
in
1947
or
the
time
of
the
decision
is
no
qed.
you
don't
just
automatically
say
that
somebody
has
75%
of
a
product,
that
they
the
power
to
exclude
and
power
over
price.
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
every
decision
on
this
subject
have
--
have
spoken
continually
of
the
need
of
analysis
of
the
market
setting,
of
the
patents
of
phrase
that
are
followed
in
practice,
of
the
buyers
habits,
of
what
takes
place
in
the
marketplace.
and
we
must
look
to
those
things
to
determine
the
significance
of
the
percentage
or,
if
you
will,
to
determined
the
significance
of
any
other
single
fact.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
we
recognize
and
we
state
to
the
court
that
cellophane
is
a
product
capable
of
being
monopolized.
we
are
not
saying
that
you
have
to
show
a
monopoly
over
flexible
fact,
the
material.
we
say
that
cellophane
is
--
is
the
product
we
made.
it
is
made
in
substantial
volumes
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
we
have
these
powers
as
to
cellophane
not
whether
we
have
these
powers
over
flexible
packaging
materials.
and
that's
the
way
the
court
below
approached
the
case.
and
he
determined,
we
did
not
have
these
powers
over
cellophane,
either
is
the
price
or
as
to
power
to
exclude.
and
in
determining
the
issue
of
price,
he
looked
not
only
to
cellophane,
its
manufacture
and
sale.
when
he
looked
to
the
market
setting
to
the
conditions
under
which
it
is
sold,
to
the
competitive
influences
in
the
market
to
determine
whether
those
were
such
as
to
deprive
the
part
of
the
power
to
price
of
cellophane
in
the
manner
which
we
were
charged
of
being
able
to
do
in
the
complaint,
arbitrarily
to
set
predetermined
rates
of
profits.
we
have
a
very
unusual
case
here
on
power
to
price
--
over
price
which
is
the
first
thing
i
want
to
discuss
because
we
are
not
before
this
court
with
any
charge
of
the
predatory
use
of
this
price
and
power.
every
case
that
i
know
of
in
this
field
has
involved
--
that
has
involved
the
power
over
price
has
been
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
predatory
use
of
that
frequently
coupled
with
exclusion.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
is
true
of
aluminum,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
it
was
shown
that
by
the
--
the
power
over
the
price
of
ingots,
a
squeeze
had
been
placed
upon
the
fabricators,
keep
them
from
competing
without
cause.
a
straight
clear
example
of
--
of
a
predatory
use
of
price
and
in
the
redding
cases
for
example
where
this
was
early
presented
to
the
court,
there
are
persons
who
--
who
shipped
over
the
railroad
or
required
to
charge
certain
prices
for
their
products
in
the
market
as
a
condition
of
shipping
over
the
railroad.
the
same
thing
was
do
--
present
in
the
--
present
in
socony-vacuum
cases
where
it
was
shown
that
these
prices
had
been
static
and
remained
unchanged
and
we're
not
responsive
to
business
and
economic
pressure.
corn
products
case,
there
was
specific
proof
of
the
use
of
this
predatory
power.
now,
we
don't
have
that
here.
we
have
no
selling
below
cost.
we
have
one
price
throughout
the
country,
to
all
users.
there
has
been
no
arbitrary
increases
in
price.
there
had
been
no
price
jiggles,
price
up
and
down
to
shake
out
a
competitor
or
take
advantage
of
the
situation
in
a
particular
locality.
there
had
been
no
static
prices.
the
prices
have
been
responsive
to
competitive
and
economic
pressures.
there's
been
no
price
conspiracy.
it
was
charged
and
litigated
and
the
court
found
that
we
didn't
have
it
and
so
they
accept
the
finding.
there
has
been
no
resale
price
maintenance.
there's
no
--
been
no
tying,
no
full
line
forces.
so,
that
we
come
to
this
question
of
power
over
price
without
any
of
the
customary
indicia
of
that
power,
which
have
been
the
decisive
factor
without
the
existence
of
that
power.
it
has
been
the
basis
of
a
determination
of
monopolization
under
section
2.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
--
the
suggestion
is
that,
your
honor,
but
i
intend
to
develop
that
that
was
not
so
because
there
were,
in
this
field,
in
the
market
place
where
we
--
we
work
and
did
our
business,
competitive
forces
which
did
not
give
us
control
over
price.
i'm
coming
to
it
in
more
detail
in
a
moment,
but
this
has
been
a
history
of
price
reduction
as
your
honors
are
probably
aware
from
the
briefs,
some
20
or
more
price
reductions
in
response
to
competitive
forces.
now,
the
question
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
say
cellophane
is
a
part
of
trade
and
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
section
2,
mr.
justice
reed,
and
it's
capable
of
being
monopolized.
but
i
say
that
it
was
not
monopolized
here
because
in
the
market
setting
in
which
it
was
sold,
the
competitive
forces
from
other
cellophane
producers
and
from
producers
of
flexible
packaging
materials
was
such
as
to
the
private
of
monopoly
power
over
price
and
that,
therefore,
it
did
not
have
monopoly
power
over
price.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
we
say
--
we
say
equally
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
we
--
we
say
equally
we
had
no
power
to
exclude
others
from
the
manufacture
of
cellophane.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that's
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
for
--
for
determining
the
question
of
our
power
over
price.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
court
did
not
decide
that,
your
honor,
and
we
do
not
contend
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
here
to
show
a
monopolization
of
flexible
packaging
materials.
we
say
that
in
the
language
of
section
2,
this
is
a
part
--
the
substantial
part
of
trade
and
commerce
cellophane
and
that
it
is
capable
of
being
monopolized
but
--
that
we
did
not
do
so.
that
you
have
to
show
a
power
to
exclude
from
others
from
the
manufacture
of
cellophane
and
we
say
we
did
not
have
that
power,
the
reasons
which
i
intend
to
cover
in
that
section
of
the
argument.
and
i
am
now
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
power
over
price
and
there
we
say,
the
competition
between
the
other
materials
is
both
relevant
and
pertinent
to
determine
what
our
power
over
price
was.
were
we
able
to
set
it
to
reach
predetermined
rates
of
profits?
were
we
able
to
set
it
arbitrarily?
were
we
able
to
raise
prices?
were
we
able
as
charged
in
paragraph
29
of
the
complaint,
which
your
honors
will
find
on
page
8,
to
price
cellophane
to
yield
predetermined
profits
without
regard
for
cost
of
productions
or
other
factors
determinative
in
a
competitive
industry?
and
we
say
we
did
not
have
that
power
and
that
in
determining
that
you
must
look
beyond
simply
competition
cellophane
and
other
cellophane
producers,
but
you
must
look
to
all
of
the
competitive
factors
in
the
market.
now
it
is,
i
think,
clear,
your
honor,
that
the
question
you
addressed
to
mr.
weston
suggested
an
answer
which
on
analysis
it
should
not
be
accepted.
i
think
mr.
justice
reed,
you
asked,
would
not
you
obviously
have
power
over
price
if
you
have
75%
of
the
manufacture
of
cellophane.
i
think
--
or
it
is
clear
that
you
would
not
obviously
have
that
power
over
price
if
in
order
to
sell
your
goods,
you
met
in
competition
not
only
the
manufacturers
of
the
other
25%
of
cellophane,
but
the
manufacturers
of
other
flexible
packaging
materials
who
because
of
their
competitive
activity
forced
your
prices
lower
and
lower,
kept
from
you
the
power
to
raise
the
prices
or
to
seek
arbitrary
levels
of
profit
and
that's
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
depends
on
what
the
market
is
and
here
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
the
question
is
what
is
the
market
for
determining
price
and
we
say
and
that
is
what
i
am
coming
to
the
stage
of
my
argument
that
it
is
the
flexible
packaging
market.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
your
honor,
i
think
that
depends
on
each
case
on
the
facts.
we
--
we
presented
here
--
we
presented
here
evidence
to
show
that
the
relevant
market
was
the
market
for
flexible
packaging
materials
and
that
is
the
market
which
the
court
found
it
was
relevant
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
which
were
shown.
so
that
in
this
case,
that
is
the
answer.
now,
it
--
it
depends
upon
what
the
product
is,
how
its
merchandized
and
a
host
of
other
factors
which
makes
it
difficult
to
generalize
and
take
the
case.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
meant
as
a
matter
of
theory.
it
is
a
--
as
a
matter
of
theory,
which
is
the
basis
on
which
the
government
argues
to
your
court
that
it's
a
separate
product
in
--
in
substantial
sales.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
in
this
market,
it
cannot
be.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
and
except
the
government
has
argued,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
and
on
that
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
this
case
must
be
decided,
that
you
must
just
take
this
product
and
move
it
away
from
the
realities
of
a
marketplace
and
say
--
and
reach
your
conclusions
about
it
without
hearing
what
the
buyers
and
sellers
have
to
say
concerning
it
all
the
factors
in
the
market
setting.
now,
i
say
that's
wrong
and
it's
against
the
teachings
of
the
cases.
now,
i
have
something
of
a
task
before
me
and
that
is
to
see
if
i
cannot
present
to
your
honors
some
picture
of
what
this
flexible
packaging
market
is
like.
and
i've
chosen
as
the
best
way
to
do
that
to
present
to
your
honors
some
folders
which
i
have
prepared
from
exhibits
that
are
in
evidence.
they
were
on
mr.
(inaudible)
desk
but
i
think
he's
absent.
and
perhaps,
it
would
be
possible
for
someone
to
hand
them
up
to
the
court.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
there
are
seven
--
there
are
seven
volumes
in
all.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
in
each
of
these
volumes
and
that
is
what
i'm
going
to
ask
you
to
turn
to
first.
you
will
find
at
the
back
some
white
pages
that
one
of
these
could
go
to
each
member
of
the
court,
at
the
back,
if
you
will
turn
first
to
the
back,
you
will
find
what
appears
on
white
pages
under
part
two,
a--
a
group
of
these
materials
and
they
are
designated
unconverted
materials
and
if
your
honors
will
examine
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that's
quite
all
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
they
are
all
different
as
to
end-use.
they
are
all
the
same
as
to
the
white
pages
at
the
back.
they
are
all
the
same
as
the
white
pages
at
the
back
and
all
different
as
--
and
uses.
at
the
back,
you
will
see
physical
samples
of
these
different
materials
starting
on
the
white
pages,
the
foils,
the
acetate,
glassines,
the
greaseproof
papers,
the
pliofilm,
polyethylene,
the
saran,
vegetable
parchment
and
the
cellophane
wax
paper
on
the
last
sheet.
those
will
give
you
some
idea
of
what
these
materials
are,
what
they'd
be
like,
what
they
look
like,
the
red
dot
that
you
see
underneath
them
gives
some
indication
of
the
degree
of
their
transparency
in
the
raw
non-converted
form.
now,
50%
of
the
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
there
are
different
manufacturers,
mr.
justice
reed.
there
are
both
large
and
small
companies
making
these
products,
companies
like
goodyear,
eastman
kodak.
it
would
be
found
in
it
various
glassine,
manufacturers.
they
are
all
listed
in
the
findings.
now,
these
--
these
products
in
the
--
on
the
white
sheets,
which
are
similar
in
all
of
your
books,
are
the
--
are
the
products
as
they
are
made
by
the
manufacturer.
about
50%
of
du
pont's
sales,
for
example,
are
in
the
form
of
the
plain
and
the
moistureproof
cellophane
which
you
see,
examples
of
--
on
the
very
last
sheet.
these
are
sold
in
rolls
to
users
of
flexible
packaging
materials.
du
pont
has
salesman
to
travel
on
the
road
and
sell
them.
your
honors
may
be
interested
to
know
that
there
are
approximately
60
different
kinds
of
cellophane
not
just
one
kind
or
two
kinds.
these
are
tailor
made
for
different
end-uses.
types
of
cellophane
designed
to
wrap
up
doughnut.
types
of
cellophane
designed
to
wrap
tomatoes.
types
of
cellophane
designed
to
meet
different
marketing
problems
and
the
wax
papers
and
the
glassines
and
the
other
materials
are
sold
also
in
large
varieties
for
the
same
purpose.
then
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
converted
materials
which
appear
at
the
beginning
of
the
volumes,
you
will
see
examples
of
wrappers
that
are
actually
used
in
the
trade.
these
are
wrappers
which
were
made
by
a
large
group
of
people
in
the
market
known
as
converters
who
buy
the
raw
materials
in
the
form
we
were
looking
at
a
moment
ago
and
then
who
print
it
or
who
process
it
or
who
combined
it
with
other
materials
and
make
it
to
suit
the
needs
of
a
particular
packager
or
a
particular
user.
coloration
is
put
on,
design,
advertising
material
and
so
forth.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
from
du
pont.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
they
then
process
it
on
the
orders
of
the
particular
packager
who
wants
the
particular
design
of
package.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
du
pont
does
not.
du
pont
is
neither
vertically
or
horizontally
integrated
in
this
business
in
any
way.
and
the
findings
are
clear
that
there's
no
control
of
any
kind
over
these
converters
and
they
are
free
to
deal
with
whom
they
choose
and
what
volume
they
choose.
they
have
some
4000
salesman
on
the
road
themselves
merchandizing
cellophane
and
about
40%
of
du
pont
cellophane
is
in
that
fashion
through
the
converters.
and
these
converters,
if
your
honor
please,
don't
just
buy
cellophane.
they
buy
all
of
these
materials
or
a
substantial
variety
of
this
material
and
they
all
fit
in
to
their
business
and
their
sales
that
are
out
on
the
road
and
they
sell
them
interchangeably
on
one
or
the
other
as
the
needs
of
a
particular
customer
at
the
particular
moment
suggests.
these
materials
as
the
court
found
are
functionally
interchangeable.
they
are
sold
at
the
same
time
to
the
same
classes
of
customers,
to
the
same
customers
for
the
same
uses,
for
the
same
purposes
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
on
that.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
in
a
word,
there
is
no
difference
that
one
can
put
in
a
word,
your
honor.
it
depends
first
of
all
on
the
use
and
it
depends
on
the
individual
needs
of
a
particular
packager
and
--
and
it
depends
on
the
price
quality
combination,
the
price
in
relation
to
the
composite
of
properties.
cellophane
has
deficiencies.
you
would
think
it
had
none
listening
to
mr.
weston.
it
has
serious
deficiency.
and
perhaps,
i
shouldn't
be
saying
that
but
it
is
sold.
and
those
deficiencies
are
capitalized
by
the
other
material.
it
has
certain
advantages
too.
and
it
is
the
composite
of
properties
in
relation
to
the
price
and
the
proof
showed
that
in
this
industry
certain
of
these
properties
had
come
to
be
known
as
properties
of
consequences
and
they
are
the
ones
upon
which
the
trade
operated.
i'll
take
an
example,
if
i
may
at
this
moment,
in
frozen
--
in
frozen
foods,
cellophane
proved
to
be
too
brittle
under
temperature
and
--
and
tear
and
it
lost
out
to
wax
paper
and
substantial
volumes
of
its
business
has
gotten
back
on
some
packages
and
i'm
going
to
come
for
more
of
that.
but
i
want
first
to
ask
you
to
turn
if
you
would
to
page
40
and
41
of
my
brief
because
there
you
see
the
end
result,
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
just
that
these
wrapping
materials,
the
hard
candies
or
the
bread
or
the
ham
or
the
bacon
which
i
distributed
to
the
bench,
but
take
a
look
at
these
statistics,
if
your
honors
will,
on
pages
40
and
41.
you
will
see
in
white
bread,
for
example,
that
wax
paper
and
glassine
are
sold
to
rough
white
bread
and
so
as
du
pont
cellophane.
du
pont
cellophane
sells
between
eight
and
nine
million
pounds
to
the
white
bread
manufacturers
but
that
is
only
6%
of
the
total
usage
by
the
white
bread
manufacturers
of
these
wrapping
materials.
and
if
you
go
on
down
the
list,
you'll
see
by
these
various
industry
and
users
on
page
40
that
while
we
have
substantial
volume
in
these
deals,
we
meet
other
materials
and
with
the
sole
exception
of
cigarettes
are
percentage
of
the
total
is
small.
and
if
you
look
on
page
41
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
six
--
well,
let's
take
the
specialty
breads,
48%
of
specialty
breads.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
oh,
white
--
the
white
breads.
6%
of
white
breads
are
wrapped
in
cellophane.
in
that
case,
you
notice
the
parenthesis,
your
honor,
we
said
all
u.s.cellophane
producers
which
is
an
exception
from
the
heading
and
that's
why
i
wanted
to
slip
down
for
the
others.
in
all
the
other
cases,
up
to
that
one
instance,
the
percentage
or
the
percentages
of
du
pont
cellophane,
du
pont
cellophane
is
48%
or
45%
of
specialty
breads
and
cakes.
there's
20%
to
30%
of
frozen
food
wraps
and
the
other
wraps
of
frozen
food
or
specialty
breads
are
of
the
other
materials
listed
in
the
third
column.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
there
are
other
two
producers,
american
viscose
and
olin.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
only
makes
6%.
that's
right.
and
on
the
right
of
page
41,
you
will
see
the
results
of
a
very
detailed
analysis
which
we
made
by
going
into
the
field
and
counting
literally
millions
of
invoices
on
ibm
cards.
and
there's
what
the
--
what
the
business
of
a
representative
group
of
these
converters
as
the
court
show
--
found
shows.
but
19%
of
their
business
is
represented
by
cellophane
and
all
of
the
rest
of
their
business,
they're
selling
these
products
at
the
same
time
to
the
same
people
for
the
same
users
--
uses
are
in
these
other
materials.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
there
has
been
more
successful
competition
by
the
other
materials
on
--
on
the
packages
for
that
end-use
obviously.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
the
record
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
the
record
does
show
this.
it
shows
that
the
in
the
case
of
cellophane,
that
cellophane
--
in
case
of
cigarettes
that
cigarette
manufacturers
are
slowed-chain.
they
--
they
have
merchandised
a
package
which
has
come
to
have
large
consumer
acceptance
so
much
so
than
in
the
war
when
foil
went
off
and
cellophane
stayed
on,
many
people
couldn't
believe
it
was
made
by
the
same
company
whose
made
it
before.
cellophane
displaced
glassine
for
substantial
amount
of
this
package,
it
is
competing
on
the
package
of
paper
and
foil
because
it's
like
a
composite
package
and
the
proof
shows
that
glassine
and
pliofilm
and
these
other
people
are
busy
at
--
at
this
business.
and
du
pont
is
busy
improving
quality
to
avoid
a
--
a
shift.
now,
what
we
--
what
we
would
like
to
do
against
this
background
is
to
deal
for
a
moment
with
this
suggestion
that
we're
concerned
with
substitutes
--
substitutes,
the
word
appears,
oh,
i
guess
20
or
30
times
in
the
government's
brief
and
it
--
it's
very
--
it's
assiduously
used
by
mr.
weston
on
his
argument.
the
suggestion
is
that
under
some
kind
of
circumstances,
somewhere
or
other
--
other
materials
may
come
in
or
just
--
as
mr.
hand
--
judge
hand
said
that
there's
a
substitute
for
everything,
but
we're
not
concerned
with
substitutes
here.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
substitutes.
if
there's
any
substitute
at
all,
this
--
and
suggested
by
or
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
cellophane.
wax
paper,
glassine
and
these
other
materials
are
found
to
have
been
dominant
in
the
market
at
the
time
we
started
to
make
cellophane.
they
are
dominant
today.
there
is
not
a
theoretical
substitution
here
but
a
constant
and
continuous
shifting
back
and
forth
of
business,
day-to-day
in
individual
accounts
and
by
end
use.
the
finding
show
that
this
has
spread
throughout
these
end
users
that
it
is
--
something
that
takes
place
rapidly
and
continuously
and
that
come
from
a
whole
host
of
factors.
in
the
first
place,
if
your
honors
please,
cellophane
is
consumed.
it's
an
obvious
fact
but
it's
an
important
one.
it
is
used
up
on
the
package
so
that
cellophane
has
to
be
constantly
sold
and
resold.
the
inventories
of
the
packagers
are
low.
all
of
the
machinery
in
this
business
is
functionally
interchangeable.
you
can
print
different
materials
on
the
same
machine
with
these
colorations
or
design.
you
can
make
a
bag
for
peanuts
with
cellophane
or
a
bag
for
peanuts
with
glassine
with
the
same
machine.
the
packager's
equipment
all
permits
a
ready
shift.
there
are
numerous
suppliers
in
the
market
and
the
buyers
are
very
knowledgeable,
companies
like
general
foods,
not
the
housewife
or
the
buyers
here.
they
have
trained
staff
of
technicians
and
experts
who
measured
these
products
and
watch
their
prices
and
watch
their
qualities
and
there
is
a
--
a
--
an
intense
competition
between
them
brought
about
in
their
own
self-interest
because
they
must
keep
their
package
prices
in
line
and
they
must
have
the
best
packaging
that
they
can
and
their
own
success
and
profits
depend
on
it.
and
here
is
a
business
with
all
of
those
factors
present
of
a
constant
change,
over
low
inventory,
machines
that
are
interchangeable,
materials
that
are
interchangeable,
intense
competition,
most
of
this
is
in
food,
your
honors
are
aware
of
the
intense
competitions
among
food
manufacturers
and
it
is
a
rapidly
expanding
business.
and
what
happened?
by
sales
and
by
advertising,
all
of
these
products
are
held
out
to
general
foods
or
to
a&t
or
who
you
will
as
being
the
best
for
his
to
pay
the
chips
or
the
best
for
his
frozen
food
or
the
best
for
his
fresh
products.
the
ads
are
in
this
record,
scores
of
ads.
the
trade
literature
shows
it.
the
court
--
judicial
notice
of
large
volumes
of
trade
--
literature
which
are
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court,
for
all
of
these
different
products
are
competing
for
the
packaging
trade.
the
court
went
out
and
went
into
the
field
and
watched
this
sold
and
saw
their
competition
at
atlantic
city
when
we
went
through
two
big
floors
of
an
exposition
there.
now,
this
--
this
type
of
competition
was
testified
to
by
every
manufacturer
who
was
on
a
stand.
it
wasn't
just
du
pont
officials
that
were
suggested
by
the
government's
brief,
but
the
leading
manufacturers
of
wax
paper,
the
manufacturers
of
glassine,
the
manufacturers
of
these
other
products
testified
and
described
the
nature
of
the
competition,
how
it
affected
their
business
and
what
was
going
on.
and
this
competition
is
a
competition
in
both
quality
and
in
price.
there
is
a
constant
effort
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
material
and
a
constant
effort
to
lower
its
price.
the
finding
show
that
in
this
period,
du
pont
is
supposedly
static
monopolist
with
these
powers
met
over
$24
million
dollars
on
research
in
the
improvement
of
these
different
products
and
of
developing
ways
of
opening
new
markets
and
making
them
more
acceptable
to
the
trades
where
they
were
used.
the
other
materials,
glassine,
wax
papers
are
doing
the
same.
there
had
been
an
intense
quality
competition,
an
intense
competition
in
terms
of
the
composite
of
properties,
which
is
to
be
offered
to
the
packages.
and
there
has
contrary
of
the
suggestions
from
the
--
mr.
weston
earlier
this
morning,
had
been
intense
price
competition
and
i
plan,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
i
returned
from
--
when
we
return
to
discuss
the
price
aspects
of
the
competition
in
this
deal.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
up
to
the
recess,
i
had
tried
in
a
few
brief
minutes
to
tell
the
court
what
30
witnesses
said
what
over
600
exhibits
say,
that's
of
course
necessarily
only
a
summary.
we
had
most
detailed
proof
on
this
phase
of
the
case.
and
if
you
will
look
at
our
brief
at
the
appendix
page
9a,
you
will
find
summarized
there
a
number
of
the
key
findings
which
the
district
court
made
concerning
the
inter
product
competition.
i
direct
the
court's
attention
particularly
to
the
finding
838
on
page
9a
and
to
the
findings
which
come
immediately
at
the
sequence
after
that.
now,
as
to
price,
the
--
the
court
said
this.
“competitive
influences
in
the
flexible
packaging
markets
place
limitation
upon
du
pont's
pricing
policies
and
procedures.”
they
force
reduction
of
du
pont's
prices
and
deny
it
power
to
raise
prices
in
the
manner
of
a
monopolist.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
from
record
302.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
19a
of
our
appendix
again,
you
will
see
set
forth
there
many
of
the
key
findings
concerning
prices.
thus,
the
court
said
that
under
market
conditions
which
prevail,
du
pont
doesn't
posses
power
to
raise
prices
without
regard
to
competitive
pressures,
and
that
the
market
would
penalize
any
attempt
to
do
so
with
lower
sales
and
smaller
profits.
the
detailed
quotations
from
record
301
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
are
illustrative
of
the
price
competition
and
there
are
other
findings
on
the
pages
immediately
follow.
the
court
refers
to
the
fact
that
cellophane
prices
have
not
been
arbitrary
and
noncompetitive
and
found
specifically
that
we
did
not
have
the
power
to
price
in
that
fashion.
now,
what
is
the
government's
answer
to
this?
it
is
i
think
an
answer
that
can
only
be
made
by
someone
who
has
not
a
detailed
knowledge
of
the
record.
the
government
says
there's
a
price
gap.
it
says
that
here
are
some
--
the
prices
of
glassine
and
wax
paper
low
in
level
and
here
is
the
price
of
cellophane
and
higher
than
that
is
the
price
of
film
such
as
pliofilm
and
polyethylene.
and
it
says
that
accordingly
as
a
matter
of
theory,
it's
obvious
that
du
pont
is
in
a
price
market
by
itself.
the
findings
of
the
court
are
all
for
the
contrary.
the
lower
price
goods
which
were
the
big
volume
sellers,
the
dominant
goods
on
the
packages,
the
pack
--
the
goods
that
were
the
major
items
that
each
of
these
end
users
were
lower
priced
and
the
whole
history
of
du
pont's
price
at
the
time
it
got
into
this
business
in
1923
has
been
the
reduce
price,
to
reduce
price,
to
reduce
price,
to
reduce
price,
to
get
down
to
where
it
is
able
better
to
compete
with
the
lower
priced
waxings
and
glass
papers.
and
the
court
found
that
with
every
one
of
those
price
reductions,
du
pont
was
able
to
increase
the
sales
of
its
cellophane
and
did
found
also
that
there
was
a
high
degree
of
cross
elasticity
of
demand
between
the
ratio
of
these
prices
and
that
as
the
cellophane
price
is
reduced,
its
sales
were
improved.
the
government
tends
very
much
to
over
emphasize
the
importance
of
this
price
gap.
it
makes
a
difference
of
two
and
a
half
meals
on
a
local
bread.
it
makes
the
difference
between
the
higher
and
the
lower
prices,
the
range
is
in
about
one
cent
per
1000
square
inches.
the
prices
are
close
and
close
in
degree,
and
they're
made
closer
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
you
see,
the
government
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
can't
give
it
to
you
in
percentages
because
the
--
the
figures
that
are
relied
on
are
--
are
pound
figures
and
of
course
the
figure
that's
important
for
the
packager
is
per
1000
square
inch.
i
think
in
--
in
think
in
the
range
of
two
and
a
half
percent
higher,
two
and
a
half
times
higher
than
wax
paper
and
glassine
would
be
a
fair
statement
of
the
percentage
in
the
time
we
are
concerned
with,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
major
types.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
but
it
--
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there
are
other
factors
here
that
operate.
there
is
not
one
cellophane.
there
is
not
one
wax
paper.
there
are
60
cellophane
and
30
or
40
wax
papers
and
glassine.
they
are
priced
differently.
in
addition
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
on
the
lower
side,
mr.
justice
black.
yes,
on
the
lower
side.
now,
in
addition,
these
--
these
products
you
see
are
important
to
the
user,
not
always
in
their
raw
form
but
in
terms
of
what
it
cost
after
they
have
been
processed,
after
they've
been
prepared
for
a
package,
after
they've
been
printed
in
a
manner
of
these
converted
items
which
i
showed
to
the
members
the
court
before
the
recess.
and
the
record
shows
that
there
is
really
what
you
would
call
a
spectrum
of
prices,
of
--
of
whole
range
of
prices
in
close
proximity
to
each
other
depending
on
what
materials
are
combined,
how
they
are
processed,
what
type
of
material
is
used
and
so
forth.
and
then
of
course,
cutting
across
this
is
also
the
problem
of
quality
and
--
and
it
may
be
that
in
a
particular
material
with
a
slightly
higher
price,
one
can
get
and
a
--
a
greater
composite
of
quality
advantages
and
a
greater
value.
but
the
inter
product
competition
price
wise
is
sharp
and
continuous
and
the
findings
are
that
it
was
intense
and
the
findings
are
that
businesses'
loss
and
gain
by
reason
of
this
price
competition.
let
me
give
you
a
couple
of
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
but
i
think
we
could
compute
it
because
we
know
what
the
total
cellophane
sales
were
for
bread.
the
--
the
interesting
thing
about
the
bread
situation,
mr.
justice
black
that
shows
the
--
the
closeness
of
this,
is
shown
by
the
record
in
this
fashion.
the
record
shows
that
as
the
price
of
flour
change,
and
therefore
the
price
of
the
bread
to
the
baker
went
up
or
down.
that
was
often
the
determining
factors
to
whether
we
stayed
with
cellophane
and
went
to
wax
paper
or
whether
we
went
to
glassine,
similarly
in
the
candy
bars.
as
the
cost
of
the
raw
ingredients
change,
many
of
these
user,
not
all
of
them
but
many
of
them
would
shift
back
and
forth
due
to
these
economic
factors
because
this
difference
was
so
slight
in
their
margin
of
profit
that
they
were
very
conscious
of
this
price
differential.
but
in
every
one
of
these
end
users
that
we've
been
looking
at,
people
side
by
side
are
using
different
materials
for
the
same
use.
it
is
possible
to
go
into
a
supermarket
and
see
bread
wrapped
in
glassine
and
wax
paper
side
by
side
selling
to
the
consumer.
and
these
price
findings
which
were
the
end
result
of
the
court's
analysis
of
all
this
material,
in
our
judgment
conclusively
show
as
a
matter
of
specific
fact
that
there
was
no
power
to
raise,
there
was
no
power
to
obtain
predetermined
rates
of
profit
or
to
price
arbitrarily.
du
pont
was
forced
to
lower
its
price
and
it
was
forced
to
keep
its
price
low
by
this
competition
and
it's
clear
if
it
raised
its
price,
it
would
lose
business
and
lose
profits.
and
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
the
price
leadership
argument
that
you've
heard
this
morning.it's
one
thing
to
have
a
price
leadership
where
you
have
lets
say
two
companies,
one
with
75%
and
one
25%
and
whichever
way,
the
75%
produced
or
goes
the
other
follows.
if
the
man
with
75%
has
freedom
of
action
to
price
as
he
chooses,
but
if
his
price
is
dictated
by
competitive
factors,
it
makes
no
difference.
i
submit
for
the
best
competition
from
cellophane
or
competition
from
some
other
material,
because
what
we're
concerned
with
is
the
existence
and
the
continuation
of
the
kind
of
competitive
economy
which
the
sherman
act
is
designed
to
promote
and
encourage.
and
these
competitive
influences
and
pressure
from
other
materials
have
--
have
on
the
findings
which
are
conceded,
deprived
upon
of
that
freedom
of
power
over
price
which
one
might
surmise
existed
otherwise
at
some
given
percentage
whatever
that
is.
of
course,
even
in
the
field
of
cellophane,
we
have
analyzed
the
evidence
in
our
brief.
i
don't
intend
to
deal
with
that
now,
but
to
show
on
the
court's
findings
in
the
field
of
cellophane
standing
alone
the
power
of
a
price
is
not
established,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
that
--
unless
there
are
some
questions
from
anyone
in
the
court
that
covers
the
section
of
my
argument,
concerned
with
power
over
price
and
i
--
i
wanted
to
turn
next
and
deal
with
the
other
major
power
that
we're
concerned
within
the
case,
the
power
to
exclude.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
in
fact,
you
see
there
was
price
competition
between
it
and
sylvania.
they
did
not
always
sell
at
the
same
price.
they
were
not
always
the
leader.
sylvania
led
at
some
occasions.
du
pont
led
on
other
occasions.
it
is
--
there's
nothing
to
show
the
existence,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
any
power.
you
can't
surmise
a
power
from
--
from
a
percentage.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
have
no
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
the
findings
don't
support
your
honor's
characterization
of
the
agreement
in
this
respect.
they
never
under
that
contract
manufactured
an
amount
that
came
within
those
prohibitions.
the
court
found
that
there
was
one-third
of
their
total
production
in
excess
of
what
they
did
produce
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
would
have
been
available
to
them.
so,
we're
dealing
with
a
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
purely
a
--
of
no
consequence
in
the
operations
of
this
market.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes,
before
they
came
to
the
30%
royalty,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
a
large
area
of
one-third
of
their
production,
which
they
did
not
utilize,
which
did
not
carry
any
increase.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
and
in
addition,
the
finding
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
what
they
--
above
what
they
did
sell.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
and
measured
and
--
and
looking
at
the
findings,
the
court
said,
“why
didn't
they
do
it?
was
it
the
agreement
or
was
it
something
else?”
and
the
witnesses
said,
“the
reason
we
didn't
do
it
was,
that
we
went
broke,
going
into
the
artificial
horse
hair
business.
we
didn't
have
the
funds
to
do
it
and
there
were
other
factors,
not
the
agreement
that
operates.”
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
near
as
a
lower
competitor.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
you
see,
ours
is
not
that
situation.
ours
is
a
situation
quite
different
from
that,
mr.
justice
black,
in
this
respect.
your
question
presumes
that
price
is
the
only
factor
that
determines
whether
a
person
buys
a
ford
or
a
cadillac
and
i
dare
say
in
our
own
individual
experience
that
may
be
true.
i'm
sure
i
would
buy
a
cadillac
instead
of
a
ford
if
i
could
afford
it.
but
that
is
not
what
the
buyers
and
the
sellers
said
in
this
market
who
are
buying
flexible
packaging
materials.
there,
we
move
out
of
the
realm
of
our
individual
experience
and
we
have
to
accept
proof.
and
the
proof
was,
that
the
buyers
and
sellers
consider
price
an
important
factor,
but
not
the
only
factor.
they
consider
also
quality
and
the
combination
of
properties,
the
degree
of
moisture
proof
protection,
the
machine
running
characteristics,
the
expense
at
which
it
can
be
processed
and
a
whole
series
of
factors
and
that
what
they
buy
is
a
price
quality
combination
and
they
look
for
the
optimum
degree
of
quality
in
these
combinations
that
they
can
find
for
a
given
price.
now,
glassine,
two
and
a
half
times
is
again
not
a
correct
position
on
the
market
entirely
because
many
glassine
sold
right
up
at
the
level
of
cellophane,
seeking
to
get
at
those
combination
of
properties
which
were
particularly
true
of
cellophane.
so
that
in
the
market,
where
you
have
this
price
quality
combination
type
of
competition,
the
price
wasn't
the
only
decisive
factor
and
if
two
men
of
bakers
in
a
given
town,
put
out
their
white
bread
to
the
tray
and
one
is
taking
cellophane
and
the
other
is
taking
glassine,
i
don't
think
you
can
any
longer
theorize
that
these
--
that
there
is
a
difference,
appreciable
difference
in
a
distinctive
market
present
on
the
basis
of
the
disparity
of
price.
if
two
people
competing,
they're
doing
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
precisely.
it's
the
difference
between
the
theory
and
the
facts.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
show
that.
it
does
show
that
the
price
of
cellophane
package
for
example,
if
i
remember
the
figures
correctly
is
.000015
cents
per
package.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
these
other
factors
we're
talking
about
and
clearly
that
must
be
true
in
--
in
the
bread
instance
where
you
see
it's
actually
operating
in
a
given
supermarket.
now,
the
power
to
exclude.
again,
it
seems
to
me
i
have
to
deal
with
the
facts.
and
on
the
facts,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
clearly
the
better
of
this
phase
of
the
argument.
now,
what
would
you
look
for
if
you're
looking
for
power
to
exclude,
not
just
the
position?
i
ask
the
court
to
recall.
there's
no
agreement.
there's
no
artificial
barrier
to
restraint.
what
would
you
look
for?
well,
the
first
might
be,
that
you
control
an
essential
raw
material,
so
that
under
no
circumstances
can
anyone
else
get
this
raw
material
and
get
into
the
business.
it's
clear
on
the
findings
that
we
had
no
such
control.
you'd
say,
“do
we
control
some
essential
equipment?
do
we
have
some
kind
as
a
shoe
machine
company
did
or
others
have
in
monopoly
cases?”
some
control
over
the
machinery
that's
used
in
the
distribution.
the
findings
are
again
clear
that
we
did
not
and
that
they're
functionally
interchangeable.
you'd
say,
“is
there
any
excess
capacity
overhanging
the
market
which
can
be
turned
on
and
off
with
a
faucet
to
drive
out
competitors?”
the
findings
again
are
explicit.
that
we've
expanded
only
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
short-range
demand
and
that
there
is
no
excess
capacity
in
the
market.
the
court
said,
“the
capacity
was
not
expanded
with
the
purpose
of
stifling
competition,
creating
excess
capacity
to
overhang
in
the
market
or
forestalling
potential
competitor.
we
look
to
see
whether
we
bought
up
any
plans
or
bought
out
any
competitors.
there's
no
evidence
of
any
of
that.
you
look
to
see
if
by
reciprocity
in
some
kind
of
trade
arrangements,
we
had
some
particular
hold
on
essential
customer,
by
requirement
contracts
or
what
you
will.
there's
nothing
of
that
sort.
the
findings
are
all
specifically
to
the
contrary,
on
the
distribution
side,
on
the
raw
material
side
and
on
the
plant
capacity
side.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
they
--
they
recite
--
they
say
those
are
two
acts
of
exclusion.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
is
what
they
say
as
i
understand
them,
mr.
justice
reed.
i
--
i'm
going
to
discuss
them
right
at
this
moment,
but
i
want
preliminarily
again
to
point
out
as
i
sought
to
do
before
the
recess
that
we
are
concerned
with
whether
we
have
monopolized,
whether
we
have
a
position
which
gives
us
monopoly
power.
if
we
do
not
have
that
position,
if
we
--
if
we
do
not
have
that
position,
then
whether
or
not
we
excluded
someone
20,
30,
40
years
ago
and
i
say
we
didn't.
but
whether
we
did
or
not,
it's
not
germane.
it
only
goes
to
how
did
we
get
where
we
are.
but
you
can't
start
of
by
saying
where
you
are
is
monopoly.
and
if
i
may
say
so,
that
is
where
throughout
the
trial,
we
had
the
greatest
clear
difference
with
the
government
and
it's
the
one
we
have
now.
the
government
assumed
the
monopoly
and
said,
“look,
you
exclude
it.”
but
the
question
is,
do
we
have
a
monopoly
position?
i've
just
shown
that
we
don't
as
to
price.
and
i
am
now
saying,
“we
do
not
have
it
as
to
exclusion
of
competitor.”
and
once
you
reach
that
question,
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
no
difference
what
your
conduct
of
section
1
was
--
may
have
been,
20,
30,
40
years
ago.
and
i
hasten
to
say
again
that
i
don't
--
i
believe
our
conduct
was
entirely
proper.
but
let
me
take
a
--
a
far
fetch
but
example
in
the
case.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
the
court
found
on
all
the
witnesses
that
we
had
no
such
intent
and
that's
accepted.
so,
they
tend
the
issue
it
seems
to
me,
unless
you
say
as
a
matter
of
law
it
--
it
rides
against
all
other
evidence.
it's
already
decided
our
way.
but
you
see
i
say
there's
another
link
in
this,
mr.
justice
reed.
you
have
to
show
a
causal
relation
between
your
position
and
your
agreement.
you
can't
just
read
the
agreement
and
say,
by
its
terms,
it
excluded
and
therefore,
that
causes
your
position.
we're
not
litigating
whether
or
not
it's
a
restraint
under
section
1.
there's
no
section
1
charge.
so,
you
have
to
--
to
litigate
a
section
2
(k)
particularly
with
agreements
dead
and
gone
and
buried.
you've
got
to
show
some
causal
relation.
now,
let
me
see
if
i
can
illustrate.
let
me
see
if
i
can
illustrate.
this
entire
business
was
built
on
moistureproof
cellophane.
there
wasn't
any
business
without
moistureproof
cellophane.
moistureproof
cellophane
on
the
court's
findings
and
in
fact
is
a
wholly
different,
unique
important
product.
it
was
invented
and
discovered
solely
by
du
pont
with
no
contribution
from
anybody.
we
had
a
broad
concededly
valid
product
patent
and
that
was
in
existence
from
1929
up
until
a
year
before
the
complaint
was
filed.
now,
no
one
could
sell
into
this
country
any
moistureproof
cellophane
until
that
patent
stood
in
the
way.
no
one
could
manufacture
moistureproof
cellophane,
because
that
patent
stood
in
the
way
and
the
french
product
was
a
--
was
a
mere
frill.
it
was
used
to
wrap
perfume
bottles.
it
was
a
gadget
to
do
that.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
our
modern
packaging
markets.
it
couldn't
be
used.
we
tried
to
use
it.
it
was
no
good.
people
wouldn't
buy
it.
it
broke,
it
stuck,
get
gummed
up
and
let
moisture
through.
it
was
nothing
and
we
invented
this
new
product
and
we
had
a
patent
on
it.
now,
can
you
still
say,
“owe
it
back
in
1923,
there
was
an
agreement
that
kept
someone
out.”
the
thing
that
kept
anybody
out
of
this
business
if
anything
did
keep
them
out
was
not
an
agreement
but
the
supervening
fact
of
an
important
patent,
as
the
court
found
and
there's
no
causal
relation.
anymore,
there
would
be
a
causal
--
we
--
we
litigated
very
heavily,
mr.
justice
reed.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
prices
were
fixed
in
the
argentine.
the
court
found
they
weren't.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
but
suppose
they
were.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
there
were
--
there
were
two
--
there
were
one
license
given
under
it
only.
the
license
was
given
to
sylvania.
olin
was
subsequently
licensed
under
companion
process
patents,
but
the
product
patent,
i'm
quite
sure
had
expired
by
the
time
of
that
license.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
it
was
given
to
sylvania.
here
is
what
happened.
they
started
to
manufacture
cellophane.
we
sued
them
for
infringement.
the
patent
was
valid.
they
were
illegally
manufacturing
and
in
the
settlement
of
the
infringement
action,
they
obtained
a
license,
an
exclusive
license.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
directly
from
du
pont.
now,
they
obtained
process
information
by
--
from
a
concern
in
--
in
abroad
known
as
(inaudible),
whose
people
had
stolen
it
from
the
french.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
cellophane
did
not.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
there
was
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
the
findings
are
that
no
one
ever
asked
for
a
license.
it
was
denied.
there's
no
proof
that
anybody
did.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
weston
says,
“now
the
court
went
all
haywire
below,”
because
he
constantly
talks
about
actual
exclusions.
well,
you
know
if
you
--
if
you
ever
been
at
the
trial
the
way
--
the
way
i
was
for
those
many
weeks,
that
would
sound
rather
amusing
to
you,
because
they
claimed
specific
exclusion
and
they
said
to
the
trial
judge,
“a,
b,
c,
d
and
e
were
excluded.”
and
so
naturally,
people
from
those
companies
came
and
took
the
stand
and
testified
and
documents
concerning
the
dealings
with
them
were
analyzed.
and
the
court
on
the
evidence
found
that
they
weren't
excluded.
and
this
district
judge
wasn't
misled
in
entering
in
the
findings
and
say,
“there
wasn't
any
exclusion
of
this
people
because
it
was
specifically
charged.”
and
i
propose
to
that
if
i
may
say
so,
when
we
were
dealing
with
this
important
secret
process
that
they're
talking
about,
which
they
say
was
the
act
of
monopolization.
you
know
what
the
issue
was
we
litigated
below?
they
said
our
agreements
with
the
french
were
illegal,
because
there
was
no
bona
fide
secret
process
that
it
was
all
a
sham
and
a
delusion
that
we
had
divided
these
markets
and
there
wasn't
any
proper
process
and
we
litigated
that
issue
out
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
an
important
process.
and
now
the
government
says,
“you
see.
it
was
apparently
important
process
and
they
are
monopolist
because
they
acquired
it.”
and
i
suggest
that
--
that
any
--
any
fair
question
of
how
you
litigate
a
case
would
show
that
that
argument
is
simply
made
up
for
the
purposes
of
argument
and
hasn't
any
substance.
we
were
confronted
with
the
same
thing
in
prices.
we
were
claimed
to
be
a
monopolist
that
we
raised
prices,
that
the
lowered
prices,
that
you
kept
prices
the
same.
if
we
paid
attention
to
competition,
if
we
didn't
pay
attention
to
competition,
it
was
all
a
theory.
now,
coming
back
to
exclusion
if
i
may,
there
is
a
question
of
olin.
olin
was
never
specified
in
the
court
below
as
an
excluded
competitor.
we
never
litigated
that
issue
in
the
court
below
and
there
was
no
finding
of
any
kind
which
indicates
that
du
pont
did
anything
to
exclude
olin.
the
government
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
we
did
nothing
as
against
olin.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
kind
that
we
did
anything
to
deter
olin.
it's
affirmatively
from
their
people
that
we
did
not.
they
didn't
even
come
to
us
for
a
license,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
asked
why
and
they
said,
“well,
they've
had
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
with
du
pont
over
the
years.”
they
didn't
think
they
ought
to
come
talk
to
him.
it's
unlikable.
they
didn't
like
the
du
pont
company,
but
they
never
cam,
never.
now,
the
government
didn't
even
ask
below
for
a
finding
that
we
excluded
all
of
them.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
suppose.
i
would
rather
put
it,
but
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
--
i
suppose
it
is.
in
the
first
place
i
say
that
they
can't
have
that
argument
as
to
olin
because
it
--
it
wasn't
an
issue
below
and
second
of
course,
the
patent
was
expand,
this
brought
product
patent
and
we
--
we
had
that
patent.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
being
we
have
was
not
du
pont,
it
was
the
ownership
of
our
own
invention.
the
--
the
government
talks
in
its
brief
at
great
length
about
the
lack
of
entry
and
places
a
great
emphasis
upon
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
lack
of
entry.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
entry
into
this
business.
there
are,
i
think,
on
the
findings,
a
--
a
good
number
of
explanation
for
that.
not
only
did
the
--
the
record
show
that
in
this
period,
we
had
of
some
18
years,
we
had
about
seven
years
of
depression
and
recession
and
six
years
of
war
and
emergency
restriction.
but
there
were
periods
from
1932
to
1936
for
example
where
du
pont
wasn't
able
to
sell
the
production
of
its
old
plant
because
--
even
with
price
reduction.
and
we
had
one
company
come
in
before
these
conditions
developed
and
one
company
come
in
immediately
afterwards.
businessmen
testified
as
to
why
they
didn't
come
in.
they
said
it
was
because
of
the
lack
of
funds
or
they
weren't
interested
in
going
into
this
field
or
that
they
--
and
i
think
this
is
the
reality.
they
preferred
to
compete
like
goodyear
did
with
pliofilm
or
like
dow
chemical
did
with
saran,
with
their
own
product
in
this
market
rather
than
to
come
with
cellophane
and
they
competed
nonetheless
strenuously.
and
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
particularly
significant
that
over
this
whole
period,
there
isn't
a
single
person
that
came
forward
and
the
government
certainly
went
up
and
down
the
country
looking
for
them.
who
said
that
du
pont
had
done
anything
for
which
they
could
complain?
there
wasn't
a
single
complainant
on
any
face
of
this
case
before
the
court.
references
made
to
profits
and
it's
suggested
that
our
profits
were
temptingly
high.
there
isn't
any
proof
that
relates
our
profits
to
anything
that
relates
to
the
profits
of
sylvania,
that
relates
into
the
profits
of
the
other
manufacturers
and
that
clearly
is
an
argument
and
nothing
more.
as
far
as
the
secret
--
engrossing
of
the
secret
process
is
concerned
we
have
a
situation
where
the
evidence
showed
the
year
after
we
got
it.
it
was
stolen
and
became
available
to
this
company,
which
set
up
plants
in
three
places
abroad.
now,
the
sylvania
agreement,
to
which
mr.
justice
reed
referred
is
the
remaining
phase
of
this
exclusion
case.
that
was
a
license
of
a
product
patent
on
an
exclusive
basis
to
sylvania.
there
was
nothing
in
it
about
plain
cellophane.
at
the
time
sylvania
had
no
patents
to
license
back,
it
did
license
back
three
or
four.
there
is
no
consequence
in
the
case.
the
agreement
contained
this
provision
with
respect
to
royalties
which
had
no
causal
relation
because
it
never
became
operated,
and
the
provision
which
of
course
is
entirely
lawful
in
the
licensing
of
a
product
patent.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
the
--
that
the
royalties
would
increase
after
a
specified
percentage
of
the
combined
production
--
combined
sale.
and
that
i
think
is
nothing
more
or
less
if
you
take
it
on
the
most
strenuous
basis
from
the
government
side
in
a
quantity,
license
on
a
quantity
basis,
which
is
of
course
much
more
liberal
than
that.
but
even
if
you
take
it
as
a
quantity
license,
certainly
there's
nothing
in
any
of
the
decisions
that
says
you
cannot
license
a
valid
product
patent
with
a
quantity
limitation
in
it.
but
after
all,
we
put
the
amount
of
business
entirely.
now,
the
affirmative
side
of
this
case
on
which
i
wish
to
spend
the
moment,
seems
to
me
equally
impressive
and
really
the
most
germane
part
of
the
argument
on
this
phase
of
the
case.
the
question
is,
why
did
we
get
where
we
are?
how
did
we
get
this
position?
and
it's
clear
on
the
findings
that
--
and
the
court
found
that
we
were
able
to
gain
our
share
of
this
business
because
of
efficiency
in
the
manufacture
of
the
product,
because
of
the
superior
quality
of
our
goods
and
because
of
the
value
of
the
services
we
gave
our
customers.
now,
that
is
not
a
finding
just
taken
out
of
the
air.
it's
a
finding
based
on
testimony
and
exhibits
that
examined
in
detail
why
it
was
we
were
able
to
sell,
why
it
was
we
were
able
to
succeed.
and
of
course
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
we've
got
a
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
and
the
correlatives
have
been
taken
out
here
in
the
united
states.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
we
--
we
got
some
patents.
and
of
course,
mr.
justice
reed,
at
the
time
we
started,
this
was
not
just
an
agreement
you
know.
we
--
we
had
a
joint
--
we
had
a
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
they
were
processed
patents
of
minor
consequence
and
they're
related
only
to
plain
cellophane.
then
we
came
along
later
with
our
own
invention
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
of
this
moistureproof
patent,
which
is
the
basic
patent.
of
course,
these
arrangements
with
the
french
weren't
quite
as
they
were
portrayed
this
morning.
we
set
up
a
company
with
the
french.
the
french
had
48%
of
the
stock.
we
were
not
competitors
when
we
set
it
out.
timken
and
those
cases
have
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
this
kind
of
event
or
situation.
there
were
no
potential
competitors.
nobody
else
find
to
get
into
the
business.
two
people
who
wanted
to
produce
and
pioneer
a
product,
they
get
together
and
formed
a
company
and
put
in
manpower
and
money,
patents
and
know-how,
take
out
shares.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes,
the
french
licensed
the
process
with
a
territorial
limitation,
which
the
evidence
shows
was
a
requirement
that
they
imposed
and
the
court
found
that
that
was
not
done
with
any
intent
or
purpose
of
restraining
trade.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
we
bought
them
out
in
1935
and
they
were
free
to
sell
thereafter
in
this
country
except
as
they
use
processes
that
they
had
received
from
us
or
the
exclusive
process
which
they
had,
with
which
we
have
done.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
those
agreements
came
about
in
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
--
those
companies
were
licensees
of
the
french.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
and
the
agreements
provided
that
the
french
could
have
and
could
pass
on
to
their
licensee
any
information
they
got
from
us.
and
so,
we
simply
dealt
directly
with
them
instead
of
passing
it
to
them
through
the
french.
but
those
--
those
agreements
were
not
of
our
--
those
agreements
flew
out
--
came
out
in
the
original
arrangement.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
as
far
as
used
--
as
far
as
using
technology
license
from
us
is
concerned,
yes.
by
their
terms,
the
agreement
so
read.
but
your
--
your
honor
understands
that
across
these
agreements
was
--
was
a
powerful
law
that
couldn't
be
surmounted
on
the
court's
finding.
there
was
a
product
patent
of
our
own
invention
which
--
which
barred
him
for
us.
and
that
these
agreements
in
fact
had
no
causal
relation
at
all
to
our
position
because
other
factors,
intervening
factors
excluded
so
that
the
agreement
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
no.
we
didn't
raise
the
tariff,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
the
tariff
agency
failed
to
assess
the
proper
tariff.
we
brought
a
suit
and
the
court
said
that
the
tariff
agency
have
been
assessing
the
wrong
tariff
and
so
it
went
up
and
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
anything
more
than
our
--
our
right
as
a
citizen
to
say
we
wanted
the
tariff
applied
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
that
was
the
legislative
policy
of
the
congress
and
the
importers
came
in
and
said,
“look
at
here.
this
is
going
to
keep
out
imports.”
as
we
show
the
court
and
congress
said,
“we're
going
to
put
the
tariff
on
anyhow.”
now
that
--
that's
clearly
isn't
the
monopolization
act
on
the
part
of
du
pont.
now,
coming
--
coming
to
this
patent,
i
have
not
spent
much
time
on
it,
but
i
think
its
significance
to
the
case
is
quite
clear.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
we
have
a
section
on
our
brief
that
deals
with
the
patent,
which
begins
at
page
111.
now,
we
acquired
whatever
position
we
had
by
the
lawful
exploitation
of
these
patent.
and
i
submit
that
any
position
so
acquired
is
immune
from
challenge
under
the
sherman
act.
it
seems
--
section
2,
it
seems
to
me
that
any
--
any
other
decision
would
be
as
we
say
in
our
brief
an
attack
on
the
basic
constitutional
provisions
with
respect
to
patents.
here
was
an
invention
which
we
made
ourselves,
which
no
one
contributed
anything
to
but
ourselves.
no
other
patents
were
brought
in
to
expand
it
or
to
exploit
it.
we
did
nothing
that
extended
the
scope
of
this
patent
beyond
the
scope
of
the
patent
grant
and
it
was
of
our
own
invention
and
discovery.
it
is
concededly
valid
and
it
went
to
the
heart
of
this
business.
some
90%
of
the
business
was
business
dependent
on
this
patent.
this
moistureproof
patent
is
the
only
patent,
only
product
which
was
of
any
consequence.
it
took
us
two
years
to
develop
the
theory
of
what
we
were
going
to
do
and
another
two
years
to
get
the
plant
and
machinery
into
operation
and
after
four
years,
we
did
and
it
is
the
thing
that
made
the
business
what
it
is
today.
the
french
didn't
contribute
anything
to
that
and
the
findings
are
explicit
on
that.
now,
what
did
we
do
with
this
patent?
we
put
it
into
operation.
we
expanded
plant.
we
gave
more
jobs.
we
constantly
lowered
and
lowered
the
price.
we
improved
the
quality.
we
adopted
many
different
types
for
different
uses.
we
did
everything
that
the
patent
laws
are
supposed
to
encourage.
and
on
the
trial,
we
heard
as
we
lowered
price
or
as
we
improved
quality
or
did
any
of
these
things,
we
are
engaging
an
act
of
monopolization.
and
i
submit
that
those
are
acts
which
the
patent
law
expects
us
to
perform.
and
that
any
position
which
is
the
result
of
that
conduct
is
a
position
which
cannot
be
attacked
under
section
2
and
the
court
found
explicitly
that
that
was
where
our
position
came
from.
that
we
had
no
intent
to
do
anything
differently
and
that
our
conduct
was
all
appropriate
in
the
development
of
this
patent
of
product.
our
superior
skills
and
our
technical
efficiency
were
what
made
us
successful
in
this
venture.
and
that
patent
is
a
patent
which
the
government
has
not
challenged
and
cannot
challenge.
and
it's
because
of
those
factors
that
the
district
court
below
said
that
this
entire
record
disclosed
the
existence
of
a
condition
in
harmony
with
our
whole
notions
of
free
enterprise
and
a
competitive
economy.
and
i
submit
that
that's
what
the
record
shows
and
no
basis
exists
for
adjudicating
that
our
position
is
unlawful
or
that
our
position
was
illegally
achieved.
