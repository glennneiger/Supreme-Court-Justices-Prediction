understood
you

a
little
while

that

that

could
be
monopolized.
and
i
take
it

may
i
ask
this
question.
you

did
not
have
power
to
fix
the
prices.
what
law
is
there
against
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that
--
that's
true,
but
what
i
was
thinking
about
was
the
--
was
the
contract
that
you
have
with
sylvania
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
prohibited
them
from
selling
beyond
25%,
unless
they
paid
30%
royalty.

could
afford

they,
if
they
had
to
pay
30%
royalty?

there
any
evidence
on
the
record

that
effect?

said
there
was
no
finding.
was
there
any
evidence
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
agreements
you
made
with
the
french
company
and
the
english
company
and
the
german
company,
limited
with
territory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
all
those
agreements
limit
them
territorial?
are
they
to
function
to
keep
them
out
of
this
company?(voice
