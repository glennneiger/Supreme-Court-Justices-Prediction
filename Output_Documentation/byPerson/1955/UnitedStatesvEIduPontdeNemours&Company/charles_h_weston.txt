mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
it
please
this
court.
this
suit
was
instituted
late
in
1947.
the
government's
complaint
charged
that
du
pont
had
been
monopolizing
interstate
commerce
in
cellophane
from
about
1923.
the
complaint
made
certain
other
charges
that
they
are
not
material
now.
after
a
lieu
trial,
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
evidence
did
not
sustain
any
of
the
government's
charges.
the
court
gave
several
grounds
for
its
rule.
the
one
which
is
attracted
the
most
attention
is
that
du
pont
did
--
could
not
have
monopoly
power
over
trade
in
cellophane
because
it
did
not
have
monopoly
control
over
trade
in,
what
the
court
called,
“flexible
packaging
materials”.
the
court
also
held
that
du
pont
did
not
have
power
to
exclude
competitors
that
certain
agreements
which
it
had
made
which
allocated
market
areas
were
not
in
illegal
restraint
of
trade
and
that
a
product
patent
on
a
moistureproof
cellophane
which
du
pont
had
and
which
was
in
existence
during
part
of
the
period
covered
by
the
monopolization
charge
was
a
defense
to
the
monopoly
charge.
the
government
is
asking
for
reversible
upon
the
ground
that
the
court
seriously
misconstrued
the
sherman
act
in
its
rulings
on
the
various
issues,
which
were
presented
to
it.
the
proof
which
the
government
introduced
was
entirely
documentary.
it
consisted
almost
entirely
of
du
pont
documents,
agreements
which
was
made,
minutes
of
meetings
of
its
executive
committee,
du
pont
correspondents,
internal
du
pont
memoranda
and
reports.
this
proof
is
contemporaneous
record
of
du
pont's
action
and
it
comes
straight
from
horse's
mouth.
du
pont
put
in
evidence
over
1000
exhibits
and
called
20
witnesses.
it
also
took
16
depositions
and
introduced
in
evidence
summaries
of
these
depositions.
the
opinion
which
the
court
filed
is
a
very
lengthy
one.
part
of
its
length
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
court
included
in
its
opinion
854
findings
of
fact.
du
pont
submitted
to
the
district
court
854
proposed
findings
of
fact.
the
court
adopted
all
of
these
without
a
single
substantive
change.
one
of
the
findings
which
it
made
does
not
make
sense
on
its
face.
one
of
the
proposed
--
an
error
crept
into
one
of
the
proposed
findings
and
the
court
took
over
this
finding
as
it
was
written.
it
did
not
notice
that
the
finding
with
this
error
contradicted
another
finding.
it
was
contrary
to
the
exhibit
cited
for
support
and
also
did
not
make
sense.
the
government
does
not
contend
that
the
findings
were
invalid
because
of
the
court
adopted
wholesale,
the
findings
which
du
pont
proposed.
but
we
think
its
action
in
this
respect
is
not
entirely
immaterial.
du
pont's
brief
states
that
this
case
was
meticulously
tried.
i
suppose
the
trial
includes
adjudication.
the
government
is
contending
that
the
court
misconstrued
the
sherman
act.
to
find
out
what
that
construction
was,
we
have
to
look
at
the
court's
findings
and
opinion
and
this
was
shown
both
by
what
is
in
them
and
what
--
what
is
not
in
them.
certain
very
important
evidence
was
given
the
silent
treatment
and
we
think
this
is
not
unrelated
to
the
source
of
the
findings.
and
so,
we
believe
that
paternity
should
be
established
whether
or
not
we
question
the
legitimacy
of
the
offspring.
the
court's
conclusion
of
law
is
at
some
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
reverse
any
finding
of
fact
upon
the
grounds
that
it
is
not
supported
by
evidence
or
is
contrary
to
the
evidence.
we
challenge
only
those
conclusions
of
the
court,
which
it
labeled
findings
of
fact
with
which
in
fact
rest
upon
and
grew
out
of
its
construction
of
the
underlying
statute.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
majority
of
them,
you
will
find
under
what
the
court
calls
conclusions
of
the
master
facts
which
appears
at
page
282
of
the
record
and
runs
through
285.
there
are
certain
others
of
the
same
character.
we
have
mentioned
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no
reason
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
challenged
those
which
have
essentially
the
same
character
as
those
in
what
the
court
call
conclusions
of
the
master
facts.
in
some
cases,
you
repeated
practically
the
same
finding
in
different
places
in
his
finding.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i've
already
said
that
we
are
not
attacking
any
finding
on
the
basis
that
it's
not
supported
by
evidence.
some
findings
are
difficult
to
assess
because
they
use
such
an
ambiguous
word
as
competition
which
may
have
very
different
meanings
in
its
different
applications.
and
among
the
findings
which
we
do
attack
outside
of
those
latter
conclusory
--
conclusory
findings
are
356,
the
721,
727,
i
think
--
i
--
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
to
be
bound
to
say
that
there
are
no
--
no
other
findings
than
those
as
i
have
mentioned
but
we
assume
that
under
the
new
rules,
it
is
not
necessary
to
specify
precisely
the
findings
attacked.
there
is
so
much
ambiguity
in
some
of
the
findings
that
you
hardly
know.
if
you
give
the
one
meaning,
we
would
have
to
attack
them,
if
you
give
them
another,
it
would
not
be
attacked.
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
721
and
727
and
356.
now,
the
court's
conclusion
of
law
if
you
care
to
look
at
it,
it
can
be
found
in
page
9
of
our
brief,
it's
relatively
short
and
i
think
i
will
read
it.
this
is
headed
conclusions
of
law.
the
facts
destroyed
the
charges
here
made.
there's
been
no
monopolization
or
conspiracy
or
combination
or
attempt
to
monopolize
shown.
the
record
reflects
not
the
dead
hands
of
monopoly
but
rapidly
declining
prices,
expanding
production,
intent
competitions
stimulated
by
creative
research,
the
development
of
new
products
and
uses
and
other
benefits
of
a
free
economy.
du
pont
nor
any
other
company
similarly
situated
should
be
punish
for
its
success.
nothing
warrants
intervention
of
this
court
effectively.
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
i
find
in
that
a
good
many
conclusions
and
some
rhetoric
but
only
think
overtones
of
law.
on
appendix
to
du
pont's
brief
is
instances
of
alleged
contradiction
between
various
statements
in
the
governments
brief
and
certain
findings
of
the
court.
we
deal
with
that
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
will
just
state
what
our
position
is.
it
is
that
in
most
instances
and
careful
examination,
it
would
be
seen
that
there
is
no
actual
contradiction.
and
where
there
is
contradiction
that
is
with
one
of
the
conclusory
findings
which
we
are
attacking.
i'd
like
to
illustrate
one
of
these
conclusory
findings.
finding
835
at
record
282,
i
will
read
it,
the
record
establishes,
this
is
the
finding,
the
record
establishes
du
pont
has
not
monopolized
trade
and
commerce
in
cellophane
or
in
caps
and
bands.
there's
nothing
there
except
the
word
“monopolized”
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
heart
of
section
2.i'll
read
one
other
finding,
finding
37,
and
i
should
say
that
finding
37
is
one
of
these
conclusory
findings
which
we
do
attack,
it's
repeated
in
finding
8
in
one
of
the
conclusory
findings.
this
is
finding
37
at
record
72,
irrelevant
market
for
determining
the
extent
of
du
pont's
market
control
is
the
market
for
flexible
packaging
materials
(judicial
notice
after
examination
and
observation).
this
is
a
compound
of
law
effect
and
judicial
notice.
i
just
don't
know
in
my
proportions.
from
the
time
available,
it's
possible
to
state
only
the
facts
which
we
regard
as
of
major
importance.
the
fact
stated
will
be
facts
found
by
the
district
court
and
in
some
instances,
facts
established
by
undisputed
evidence
but
ignored
in
the
findings.
du
pont
became
interested
in
getting
into
manufacture
of
cellophane
in
early
1920s
after
it
had
learned
that
a
french
company
called
la
cellophane
had
developed
a
successful
process
for
making
cellophane.
the
court
found
this
process
had
been
developed
as
the
result
of
years
in
research
and
practical
operating
experience.
and
the
court
found
that
it
would
have
taken
du
pont
from
five
to
eight
years
to
reach
the
same
point
of
development
and
would
have
cost
it
a
considerable
sum
of
money.
a
witness
for
du
pont,
chemical
director
of
its
cellophane
subsidiary
testified
that
the
process
had
at
least
50
variables
and
that
a
company
starting
from
scratch
would
have
to
test
out
each
of
these
50
variables
in
all
their
permutations
and
combinations
which
he
said
he
wasn't
a
mathematician
but
went
into
the
million.
this
testimony
is
not
mentioned
in
our
brief,
it's
at
record
2063.
i
also
want
to
emphasize
that
the
court
found
that
up
to
time
of
the
trial,
no
other
--
the
only
other
commercial
process
which
had
been
developed
was
inferior
to
cellophanes
in
cost
of
manufacture
and
quality
of
product.
la
cellophane
and
du
pont
both
kept
this
process
secret
by
a
system
of
fences,
plant
guards
and
passes.
when
the
director
of
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
there
was
no
patent
at
that
time.
there
were
patents
--
some
--
the
french
had
some
patents
that
du
pont
decided
and
counsel
for
du
pont
conceded
in
the
lower
court
that
they
were
practically
useless.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
secret
process.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
was
--
it
was
a
very
intricate
process
involving
chemical
compositions
and
chemical
controls
especially
designed
machinery,
especially
designed
plan.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes
because
i
--
i
will
come
to
it
in
a
minute.
this
was
all
put
in
du
pont's
hands
and
under
an
agreement
whereby
nobody
else
could
get.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
an
agreement
to
keep
others
from
getting
a
secret
process.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
it
--
it
certainly
--
the
secret
process
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes
and
that
he
would
not
--
not
come
in
into
the
territory
himself,
that
he
would
not
any
--
let
--
let
any
licensee
of
his
come
into
the
territory
and
that
you
would
have
an
exclusive
dominion
in
the
given
territory.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
had
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
had
some
old
patents
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
it
had
some
patents
which
had
been
taken
out
a
number
of
years
earlier
when
du
pont's
--
and
it
did
transfer
what
it
had
to
du
pont
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
but
when
du
pont's
counsel
came
to
investigate
that,
they
found
that
the
patent
situation
was
practically
useless.
they
said
we
won't
be
able
to
maintain
a
monopoly
on
the
basis
of
the
patents.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
because
the
patents
were
apparently
very
sketchy.
and
it
was
testified
that
you
could
not
have
made
cellophane
as
la
cellophane
made
it
by
following
the
instructions
of
the
patents.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
think
that
is
not
the
questioned
at
all.
it's
found
by
the
district
court.
and
court
found
that
it
--
it
was
essential
to
commercial
manufacture.
now,
du
pont
looked
into
the
profit
possibilities
that
having
a
company
making
cellophane
and
which
would
have
exclusive
rights
in
north
and
central
america,
it
is
decided
that
the
profit
possibilities
were
excellent.
1923,
it
made
an
agreement
with
la
cellophane
and
la
cellophane
turned
over
its
complete
information.
it
sent
over
an
engineer
to
plan
and
supervise
the
construction
of
the
new
plant,
it
trained
personnel
in
france
and
united
states.
the
agreement
between
the
companies
granted
to
du
pont
exclusive
rights
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
is
that
when
--
record
3245
it
begins,
there
--
there
was
a
subsequent
greentouch
gx-1001
and
that
was
implemented
by
another
agreement,
gx-1003.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
at
record
3245.
the
exclusive
selling
rights
were
without
any
limitation
in
time.
exclusive
manufacturing
rights
were
without
limitation
of
time
except
as
against
la
cellophane
itself
and
it
was
impliedly
authorized
to
come
in
and
manufacture
after
december
31,
1935,
more
than
12
years
after
this
agreement
was
made.
it
expressly
provided
that
these
exclusive
rights
should
continue
in
effect
if
french
saw
their
stock
interest
in
the
new
company.
i
should
say
that
the
french
got
48%
of
stock,
du
pont
52%.
in
1929,
du
pont
got
all
the
stock,
but
later
merged
with
du
pont.
now,
we'll
generally
refer
to
the
--
this
new
company
as
--
as
du
pont.
the
court
found
that
la
cellophane
was
not
willing
to
turn
over
the
secret
process
unless
du
pont
can
find
manufacture
sale
to
north
and
central
america.
it
did
not
find
that
la
cellophane
demanded
that
it
be
excluded
from
du
pont's
territory.
du
pont
came
into
the
cellophane
business
and
--
and
were
set
up
which
was
designed
to
prevent
any
--
and
it
would
be
american
manufacture
from
obtaining
access
to
necessary
technology.
the
things
work
according
to
plan.
du
pont
would
have
a
monopoly
with
the
north
and
central
american
trade
for
indefinite
future.
things
did
work
according
to
plan.
in
fact,
the
only
real
reach
in
it
resulted
from
the
filing
of
this
present
suit,
for
27
years
until
1951,
only
one
company
came
into
the
business
and
it
came
in
under
circumstances
which
the
parties
could
hardly
foreseen
and
which
was
not
likely
to
be
repeated.
now,
plan
to
exclude
competitors
and
success
in
achieving
it
pinpoint
power
to
exclude
in
very
unusual
degree,
but
in
this
case,
these
powers
pinpointed
even
more
precisely.
a
very
substantial
company
tried
and
tried
hard
to
get
into
the
business
and
failed
until
du
pont
itself
opened
the
door
in
1951
after
the
suit
has
been
tried.
now,
the
company
which
came
in,
in
1930
was
sylvania,
called
sylvania.
it
came
in
because
it
was
able
to
obtain
the
same
complete
information
about
the
la
cellophane
process
that
had
enabled
du
pont
to
begin
to
manufacture
cellophane
in
1924.
and
this
came
about
in
this
way.
la
cellophane's
chief
engineer
absconded
with
blueprints
and
complete
information
about
its
process.
a
syndicate
was
formed
and
with
this
information,
a
belgian
company
was
established
to
manufacture
cellophane
under
the
la
cellophane
process.
it
established
sylvania
as
an
american
affiliate
and
in
turn
transmitted
to
it
this
complete
information.
la
cellophane's
former
chief
engineer
came
over
to
design
and
supervise
construction
of
sylvania's
plant
which
at
fredericksburg,
virginia.
now,
i
mentioned
that
the
company
started
to
manufacture
cellophane
in
1951.
this
is
olin
industries,
which
would
be
called
olin.
it
became
interested
in
getting
into
the
cellophane
business
as
far
back
as
1929.
three
different
years
conferred
with
representatives
with
the
one
company
which
had
a
commercial
independent
process
for
making
cellophane.
it
visited
that
company's
plants
in
germany.
it
decided
after
a
complete
investigation
that
this
was
not
a
satisfactory
process,
then
spend
about
a
million
dollars
in
trying
to
develop
the
process
of
its
own.
it
finally
gave
up
this
attempt
in
1944.
these
facts
were
given
by
du
pont
witness,
vice
president
(inaudible),
on
direct
examination
by
du
pont's
counsel.
du
pont's
brief
suggests
that
this
evidence
should
be
ignored
because
the
government
in
pretrial
proceedings
had
not
name
olin
as
an
excluded
company.
i
submit
that
evidence
is
evidence,
whether
it
was
known
to
the
government
in
advance
of
the
trial
or
whether
it
was
introduced
by
the
defendant
or
by
the
government.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
it
--
it
--
but
it's
under
the
american
tobacco
case.
it
is
possession
of
power
to
exclude
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
rather
than
it's
exercising.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
there
was
no
overt
--
no
overt
act
in
du
pont's
part
in
that
connection.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no
--
no
overt
act.
it
was
--
really
wasn't
necessary.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
as
if
they
never
reached
that
point.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
there
was
no
proof
that
it
--
it
was
an
overt
act
other
than
stopping
at
--
stopping
it
at
the
source,
if
we
may
say
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
by
foreclosing
access.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
it
is
also
--
this
wasn't
a
license
if
this
was
to
go
on
forever.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
was
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
--
we
did
charge
that
they
had
taken
steps
to
prevent
certain
companies
from
getting
into
the
business.
the
court
found
against
us
on
those
charges
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
are
not
challenging
those
findings.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
we
certainly
do.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
that
on
the
power
to
exclude
that
--
that
was
the
basis
of
it.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
it
--
but
it
came
in
as
we
--
as
i
just
explained
that
through
circumstances
that
it
could
it
hardly
been
foreseen.
in
other
words
--
in
effect,
the
la
cellophane
process
was
stolen.
i
may
say
that
la
cellophane
sued
this
belgian
company
and
evidently
the
suit
was
regarded
as
pretty
serious
because
it
was
settled
by
transferring
about
one-third
of
the
belgian
company
stock
to
la
cellophane
in
the
settlement
of
this
suit.
so
that
sylvania
came
in
because
somebody
had
ran
of
with
information
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
sylvania
was
that
--
got
that
right,
but
now,
olin
is
the
company
that
was
not
able
to
manufacture,
wasn't
just
trying
to
and
i'm
going
to
say
now
how
--
how
du
pont
brought
it
in,
in
1951.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
because
it
turned
to
the
only
independent
source
of
this
german
company
and
found
his
process
satisfactory
and
it
was
unable
to
develop
in
the
other
process
of
its
own.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
because
this
was
--
this
was
apparently
the
only
satisfactory,
workable
way
of
making
cellophane
and
it
was
exclusively
in
du
pont's
possession
as
far
as
this
county
was
concerned.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
of
course,
a
company
can
use
its
own
discoveries
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
but
you
cannot,
i
think,
deal
with
so-called
secret
processes
and
use
them
as
means
of
agreement
with
other
companies
in
a
way
that
would
go
beyond
what
would
be
permissible
with
those
with
patent
rights.
a
--
a
--
when
patents
are
use
in
such
way
as
to
allocate
market
territories,
in
ways
beyond
the
limited
rights,
the
monopoly
rights
with
patent,
they
do
not
constitute
a
defense
to
the
sherman
act.
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
--
i
think
it
does
not.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
now,
how
did
olin
come
into
the
business?
after
this
suit
was
filed,
du
pont
decided
that
it
would
not
go
ahead
with
plans
which
it
had
for
--
taking
a
--
adding
a
new
plant
and
it
would
be
desirable
to
bring
a
new
competitor
into
the
business.
it
prepared
a
memorandum
which
was
submitted
to
companies
which
might
be
interested.
the
opening
sentence
in
this
memorandum
is
to
help
meet
the
u.s.need
for
more
cellophane
and
to
reduce
the
hazards
of
being
judge
to
have
a
monopoly
of
the
u.s.cellophane
business,
du
pont
is
interested
in
having
a
new
competitor
established
common
substantial
scale.
and
du
pont's
brief
had
suggests
that
the
secret
technology
which
was
essential
to
successful
manufacture
might
have
been
obtained
from
the
belgian
company.
but
sylvania
with
this
company's
subsidiary
and
was
doing
very
nicely
on
sharing
the
monopoly
which
--
sharing
with
du
pont,
the
monopoly
of
the
business
in
this
country
on
this
25%
--
75%
basis.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
that
was
--
it
was
remarkably
stabled
but
there's
no
evidence
of
agreement.
now,
this
was
a
monopoly
of
a
very
rapidly
growing
and
profitable
industry
and
the
belgian
company
was
not
likely
to
upset
the
(inaudible)
now,
the
significance
of
long
continued
non-entry
into
an
industry
depends
partly
on
what
opportunities
this
holds
out
for
others.
in
this
case,
the
growth
of
the
cellophane
industry
was
constant
and
spectacular
from
the
very
beginning.
but
we're
not
going
to
figure
it
in
the
court's
findings.
they
are
referred
to
in
our
brief.
profits
were
high,
very
high
and
certainly
sets
us
to
attract
others.
in
1929,
du
pont
bought
the
stock
which
the
french
shown
in
the
cellophane
subsidiary.
it
bought
that
stock
on
the
basis
that
it
was
then
worth
15
times
where
du
pont
had
paid
for
it
when
the
company
was
organized.
the
company
then
had
been
in
operation
for
five
years.
in
other
words,
du
pont
bought
on
the
basis
that
that
stock
had
tripled
in
the
value
in
each
year
of
operation.
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
they
make
300%
profit
every
year.
i'm
sure
that
du
pont
was
discounting
the
monopoly
outlook
for
that
company.
this
was
before
sylvania
had
come
in.
now,
i've
been
discussing
up
to
this
point
chiefly
facts
appearing
on
power
to
exclude.
du
pont's
power
over
the
prize
of
cellophane
is
not
really
in
dispute.
cellophane's
price
has
been
whatever
du
pont
chose
to
make
it.
but
the
court
did
not
find
that
it
did
not
have
this
power.
all
that
it
found
was
that
it
did
not
have
arbitrary
pricing
power.
and
what
the
court
meant
as
its
finding
showed
is
that
du
pont
did
not
have
pricing
power
free
from
such
indirect
and
impartial
limitation
as
resulted
from
competitions
of
lower
price
substitutes
for
cellophane.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
on
--
on
power
to
exclude,
but
obviously,
monopoly
power
over
prices
also
known
and
i
want
to
the
state
the
facts
on
that.
i
was
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
what
is
it?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
it
did
up
until
1930,
pennsylvania
came
in
and
i
want
to
show
what's
--
it's
--
whether
that
brought
a
change
in
this
situation
or
not.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
no,
it's
just
that
it
had
superiority
in
manufacturing
efficiency,
the
court
found
in
quality
of
its
product
and
service
to
customers
and
it
also
had
about
50
times
the
resources
of
this
company
and
the
company
never
competed
with
du
pont
in
price.
the
court
found
that
each
time
du
pont
issued
a
new
price
list,
sylvania
issued
a
list
copying
du
pont's
prices
dating
it
back
to
the
date
of
the
du
pont
list.
now,
this
did
not
only
did
sylvania
do
this
but
the
process
was
automatic.
sylvania's
office
manager
testified
that
the
standing
instruction
from
sylvania
management
was
that
when
he
obtained
a
copy
of
the
new
du
pont
price
list,
you
should
have
a
new
sylvania
list
printed
and
copying
du
pont's
price
list
and
sent
to
customers.
this
testimony
is
at
pages
756
and
757
and
also
not
mentioned
in
our
brief.
now,
du
pont
takes
the
position
that
this
is
mere
price
leadership.
price
leadership
implies
that,
at
least
sometimes,
there
is
a
change
in
leader.
it
implies
that,
at
least
occasionally,
the
followers
exercise
a
little
independent
judgment
before
following
the
leader
that
they
are
not
mere
automatized.
and
it
implies
that
there
is
more
than
one
private
in
the
ranks
that
it's
price
command
not
price
leadership.
now,
i
want
to
mention
a
few
facts
about
the
product
patent
which
du
pont
had
on
moistureproof
cellophane.
it
issued
in
november
1929
and
expired
in
november
1946.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
that
--
no,
this
is
solely
on
what
is
called
moistureproof,
which
is
--
means
as
the
name
implies
that
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
there
--
there
was
--
the
government
did
raise
the
issue
of
whether
du
pont
had
assembled
a
great
body
of
patent
which
serve
to
block
the
cellophane
industry.
the
facts
are
very
complex.
the
court
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we're
not
pressing
that
point.
so
that
the
only
--
only
patent
is
used
as
a
defense
by
du
pont.
they
did
have
some
accessory
patents
with
the
basic
patent
on
which
they
relies
its
product
patent.
now,
it
resulted
from
research
to
make
cellophane
more
resistant
to
moisture
which
was
recommended
by
the
director
of
the
cellophane
subsidiary,
provided
du
pont
was
prepared
to
spend
up
to
$5000
to
$10,000
before
calling
off
the
project.
the
evidence
does
not
show
how
much
the
research
cost
except
that
it
shows
that
it's
considerably
under
$41,000.
moistureproof
cellophane
is
made
by
taking
plain
cellophane,
and
--
the
plain
cellophane
film
and
running
it
through
a
solution
containing
such
things
as
resins,
paraffin
and
more
vegetable
fats.
when
its
--
went
through
this
solution,
there
is
a
very
thin
moistureproof
coating
applied
in
each
sides
of
the
film.
so
you
cannot
make
moistureproof
without
first
making
plain.
the
du
pont
had
illegal
power
to
exclude
to
manufacture
plain.
that
illegal
power
equally
excluded
others
from
making
moistureproof.
this
power
did
not
become
legal
because
du
pont
obtained
a
patent
which
gave
it
a
secondary
legal
power
of
exclusion.
it
never
had
to
invoke
that
patent
because
no
one
ever
came
in.
it
didn't
--
didn't
invoke
it
against
sylvania
but
this
suit
was
settled
--
settled
by
an
agreement
under
which
du
pont
licensed
sylvania
for
the
life
of
the
patent.
this
agreement
provided
for
a
--
relatively
small
royalty,
but
if
sylvania's
percentage
of
total
production
of
the
two
companies
exceeded
certain
stated
amounts,
it
was
an
absolutely
prohibitive
royalty.
in
addition,
the
agreement
--
the
license
agreement
provided
that
each
company
would
transfer
to
the
other
on
request
any
future
moistureproof
patent
which
it
might
obtain
and
that
such
a
patent
would
not
be
licensed
to
any
third
person
without
the
consent
of
both
parties.
now,
du
pont's
agreement
with
la
cellophane
required
it
to
exchange
with
all
its
future
acquired
information,
apparatus
and
patents,
so
that
this
moistureproof
patent
passed
to
la
cellophane
under
this
agreement,
but
only
for
use
outside
of
du
pont's
territory.
furthermore,
du
pont
had
entered
into
agreements
with
two
subsequent
licensees
of
la
cellophane,
an
english
company
and
the
german
company.
and
du
pont
had
made
agreements
for
exchange
of
present
and
future
technology
and
patents
with
each
of
these
companies
and
each
provided
that
this
all
was
to
be
used
only
in
the
respecting
exclusive
territories
of
the
parties.
now,
i
come
to
the
question
whether
competition
of
flexible
packaging
materials
prevented
du
pont
from
having
to
not
compare
us
to
cellophane.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
whether
competition
of
other
flexible
packaging
materials
prevented
du
pont
from
having
monopoly
power
as
to
cellophane.
it
could
be
put
this
way,
can
cellophane
be
monopolized
only
if
the
entire
packaging
field
is
monopolized.
but
the
district
court's
view
was
that
there
could
be
no
monopoly
control
over
cellophane
without
control
over
this,
what
it
called
the
flexible
packaging
materials
market.
i
want
to
say
that
there
is
no
defined
recognized
market
of
this
kind.
what
the
court
meant
by
this
was
the
materials
which
are
primarily
used
for
prepackaging,
retail
packages.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
selected
kind
of
market
to
start
with.
the
materials
which
the
court
designated
as
flexible
packaging
materials
are
cellophane,
other
films,
certain
products
made
of
paper
and
aluminum
foil.
we
can
set
aluminum
foil
at
one
side,
what
could
be
said
about
the
paper
products
applied
generally
--
generally
to
it
and
it
was
competitive
with
cellophane
anyway
only
for
very
limited
uses.
the
competition
of
the
other
films
can
also
be
disposed
off.
they
came
into
the
market
almost
at
the
end
of
the
period
and
covered
it
by
the
monopolization
charge.
competition
which
did
not
even
exist
in
this
period
could
not
have
precluded
possession
of
monopoly
pricing
power.
in
addition,
the
--
their
sales
were
very
small
and
their
prices
are
away
above
the
price
of
cellophane.
i
will
refer
to
what
was
said
in
a
du
pont
exhibit
to
the
1948
report
of
its
cellophane
division.
these
report
sales
that
nonviscous
films,
that
is
those
other
cellophane,
had
been
competitive
with
cellophane
only
to
a
very
minor
degree
that
some
are
used
very
little
or
not
at
all
in
packaging.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
we
think
that
that
--
that
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
issues
presented
by
this
monopoly
case.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes
and
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes
and
--
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
du
pont
was
so
completely
dominant
in
the
field
that
it
by
--
all
except
the
test
had
monopoly
power.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
over
cellophane.
and
i
have
just
shown
that
there
are
only
three
other
things
considered
and
really,
you'll
get
back
to
the
paper
products
because
these
films
came
into
the
picture
too
late
and
too
little.
now,
i
would
just
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
yes,
yes,
glassine
and
grease
--
all
that
first
group
of
paper
and
the
second
group
of
paper,
the
third
group
of
paper,
all
those
first
--
first
three,
the
big
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
--
it
did.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
--
it
did
both.
it
did
both.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
figures
on
growth,
overall
growth
over
a
period
of
years
or
somewhat
inconclusive,
cellophane
grew
faster
than
these
others.
they
--
none
of
them
stood
still.
it
is
obvious
that
packaging
has
grown
enormously,
but
cellophane
has
grown
faster
than
any
of
the
others.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
depends
on
what
you
call
by
function.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
cellophane
provided
something
different
than
any
of
the
others
did.
it
--
and
a
purchaser
of
packaging
materials
looks
at
its
composite
qualities
and
no
other
material
approached
the
composite
qualities
of
cellophane.
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
of
course,
they
we're
wrapping
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
was
no
--
no
--
it
was
the
first
film
of
the
kind
if
--
if
that
is
your
question.
the
film
--
of
course,
the
characteristic
of
that
is
transparency.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
no,
they
--
well,
it
--
you
have
to
distinguish
the
paper
products
were
in
there
and
they've
always
been
in
there,
the
first
three
groups.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
had
--
the
monopolistic
cellophane
had
a
monopoly
of
a
--
of
the
markets
where
cellophane
was
superior
to
anything
else
and
that
was
a
very
large
market.
there
was
no
competition
between
cellophane
and
these
other
materials
on
the
basis
of
price.
the
price
of
cellophane
was
an
early
period
seven
times
out
of
these
paper
products.
later
on,
it
was
four
times.
subsequently,
it
came
--
it
became
in
1949
about
double.
with
competition
in
this
sense,
that
some
purchasers
and
any
would
compare
these
superior
qualities
and
characteristics
of
cellophane
as
against
the
lower
cost
of
paper
made
products.
they
might
sometimes
choose
one
or
sometimes
choose
the
other
but
there
was
no
price
competition.
it
was
--
we
might
say
that
because
i
have
a
monopoly,
we'll
say,
oil
burners
that
because
there
are
some
gas
burners
that
somebody
else
has
but
then,
i
couldn't
have
a
monopoly
of
the
oil
burner
business.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
certainly
think
it
is.
let
us
look
at
the
situation,
just
brought
it
broadly.
cellophane
has
grown
enormously.
the
trade
and
the
profits
have
been
high.
but
it's
always
been
a
way
above
the
prices
of
these
paper
products.
it
did
not
differ
functionally
and
materially
from
the
lower
price
products.
how
could
it
have
grown
and
expanded
and
profited
when
the
other
products
were
always
available
at
half
or
less
cellophane's
price?
now,
the
--
of
course,
the
characteristics
of
these
wrapping
materials
are
shown
in
the
court's
findings.
we
refer
to
them
in
our
brief
and
they
are
functionally
wide
apart.
now,
what
did
--
what
did
this
du
pont
management
itself
think
was
the
competition
which
it
faced
in
its
cellophane
business?
in
reports
submitted
year
after
year
by
the
cellophane
division
to
the
executive
committee
and
reports
submitted
to
the
executive
committee
and
other
higher
officials,
provide
information
as
to
--
for
making
major
policy
decisions
such
as
plan
expansion.
the
sole
competition
referred
to
was
the
competition
of
other
cellophane
and
other
films.
there
are
three
and
--
out
of
23
reports,
there
are
three
trifling
references
to
paper
products
almost
completely
varied.
now,
i
submit
that
the
salients
respecting
competition
of
paper
products
cries
out
loud.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
a
1950
report,
prepared
by
the
cellophane
division,
which
still
among
other
things
with
cellophane's
future
competition.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
is
--
that
is
gx-587
at
record
4070.
you
might
possibly
be
interested
in

mr.
charles
h.

the

is

mr.
charles

oh,
well,

now,
the
subheadings
under
--
under
table
of
contents
relating
to
economics
and
competition,
the
two
dealing
with
competition,
competition
--
competitive
position-against
cellophane.
next
one,
competitive
position-against
non-cellophane
films.
now,
the
text
of
the
report
conforms
to
that,
those
headings,
there
is
not
a
mention
made
of
paper
products.
now,
i
want
to
read
the
first
sentence
under
the
part
dealing
with
competition,
that's
at
record
4070
under
that
heading.
competition
for
du
pont
cellophane
will
come
from
competitive
cellophane
and
from
non-cellophane
films
made
by
us
or
by
others.
i
may
say
that
du
pont
manufactured
also
certain
other
films.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
of
course,
as
you
notice
the
source
of
the
findings
and
--
and
there
--
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
is
not
favorable
to
du
pont.
there
is
a
table
which
shows
the
characteristics
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
physical.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
the
evidence
was
that
--
it
was
a
very
tough,
transparent,
flexible
and
it
also
had
the
moistureproof
qualities
as
--
as
--
will
not
just
develop
if
the
cost
is
around
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
$41,000.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
what
paper?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
each
one
of
this
can
perhaps
be
partly
paralleled
but
the
purchasers
buy
on
the
basis
of
composite
whole.
and
now
take
a
thing
like
fresh
meat
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
for
serve
--
yes,
for
serving
the
--
especially
retail
needs
where
the
customer
can
see
what
he's
buying.
now,
take
fresh
meat
in
the
self-service
stores
where
it's
sold
by
the
individual
units,
75%
of
that
has
been
du
pont's
cellophane.
now,
of
course,
there's
competition
in
the
sense
that
some
purchasers
see
only
a
small
advantage
between
the
qualities
of
--
which
cellophane
gives
and
it's
our
cost.
but
as
i
said,
this
is
not
competition
in
the
basic
price.
du
pont
has
had
the
power
to
fix
the
price
of
cellophane
at
the
particular
point
at
which
sales
volume,
probable
sales
volume
multiplied
by
a
price
would
yield
the
highest
profit
and
i
submit
this
is
the
essence
of
monopoly
pricing
power.
when
the
product
is
sufficiently
unique
to
invest
consumer
acceptance
that
cellophane
has,
it's
inevitable
that
there
are
some
uses
in
which
it
is
--
stands
out
above
all
others.
now,
take
the
ordinary
package
of
cigarettes
with
which
you're
all
familiar,
for
years
and
years,
cellophane
has
been
practically
exclusively
the
other
wrap
for
cigarette
packages.this
trade
alone
runs
into
many
millions
of
dollars.
now,
it
sales
to
users
like
the
cigarette
companies,
the
monopolies
to
cellophane
certainly
has
the
monopoly
pricing
power.
i
submit
that
this
power
does
not
vanish
into
thin
air
because
he
chooses
to
expand
his
sales
into
areas
where
there
may
be
a
relatively
small
margin
of
advantage.
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
makes
it
unlawful
as
everyone
knows
to
monopolize
any
part
of
the
interstate
commerce.
now,
direct
and
immediate
dominion
over
a
particular
product
or
a
segment
of
trade
which
constitutes
part
of
interstate
commerce
certainly
--
obviously
comes
directly
within
these
words.
and
most
of
the
decisions
deal
with
section
2,
the
courts
have
considered
only
whether
that
dominion
was
shown
and
when
it
was
shown
and
held
that
section
2
was
violated.
they
have
not
even
intimated
that
the
indirect
limitation
and
pricing
power
that
may
come
from
availability
of
substitutes
makes
the
power
which
is
exercised
over
the
commodity
itself
not
a
monopoly
power
which
section
2
condemns.
if
this
kind
of
indirect
nebulous
uncertain
limitation
on
pricing
power
where
a
defense,
section
2
of
the
act
would
be
a
dead
letter
because
there
are
substitutes
for
every
product.
there
is
always
this
--
this
kind
of
indirect
limitation
on
pricing
power.
the
competition
or
availability
of
substitutes
has
been
considered
in
a
few
cases,
the
courts
have
held
that
they
should
limit
their
attention
to
those
which
are
indistinguishable
or
substantially
indistinguishable
in
use
value
and
so
with
substantially
the
same
price.
now,
our
brief
used
the
words
substantially
fungible,
it's
a
shorthand
phrase
for
substantially
indistinguishable
in
use
value.
we
did
not
mean
that
one
product
had
to
be
precisely
the
same
in
all
its
physical
characteristics
to
be
indistinguishable
in
use
value.
du
pont's
brief
suggest
that
our
interpretation
would
mean
that
there
could
be
monopolization
of
a
particular
make
of
automobile.
there
was
this
purchaser
buys
as
what
the
car
as
a
whole
represents.
two
cars
of
approximately
the
same
price
or
for
the
great
body
of
purchasers
indistinguishable
use
value.
if
one
is
two
inches
longer
than
another
or
if
some
will
buy
that
car
because
they
think
it
gives
some
additional
prestige
or
comfort
and
others
will
not
buy
it
because
it's
harder
to
park
or
put
in
the
garage.
the
holding
of
the
court
that
du
pont
did
not
have
monopoly
pricing
power
was
rested
solely
on
the
ground
that
section
2
does
not
make
a
legal
pricing
power
which
is
limited,
however,
remotely
by
the
existence
of
a
free
market
in
lower
price
substitutes
of
the
kind
which
the
evidence
discloses.
if
this
was
a
misconstruction
in
section
2,
the
court
erred
in
its
determination
of
the
monopoly
pricing
power
issue.
and
if
--
since
possession
of
either
monopoly
pricing
power
or
power
to
exclude
is
a
monopolization
which
section
2
condemns
error
in
this
determination
of
the
monopoly
pricing
power
required
reversal.
we
also
submit
that
there
were
errors
in
its
determination
of
car
to
exclude
each
required
reversal.
in
american
tobacco
case,
it
was
held
that
mere
--
that
the
existence
of
power
to
exclude,
irrespective
of
its
exercise,
its
actual
exercise,
violates
section
2
that
what
is
forbidden
is
not
merely
power
of
total
exclusion
but
power
to
exclude
competition
to
its
substantial
extent
when
it
is
desired
to
do
so.
the
district
court
did
not
cite
the
american
tobacco
case
in
the
portion
of
its
opinion
dealing
with
power
to
exclude.
it
did
not
cite
this
case
anywhere
else
in
its
65
page
opinion
with
reference
to
this
matter,
except
for
its
short
quotation,
which
merely
sets
forth
the
basic
proposition
that
--
where
there
is
power
to
exclude
that
as
a
violation
of
section
2.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
think
as
to
power
over
prices
it
would
be
now
as
to
power
to
exclude.
there
might
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
--
i
think
that
it
would
also
depend
on
whether
it
--
there
was
free
entry.
in
other
words,
if
--
nobody
came
in
because
he
didn't
choose
to
do
so,
there
would
not
be
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
it
is
relevant
in
the
sense
that
size
could
not
be
obtained
without
the
size
of
trade
that
was
obtained
here,
could
not
be
obtained
unless
that
product
was
unique
and
for
which
there
was
a
great
demand.
now,
if
--
if
there's
a
raiser
through
other
raisers
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
well,
no,
no.
there
--
there
you
--
you
can
pay
your
price
and
get
--
get
your
product.
there
are
plenty
of
things
on
the
market.
you
may
want
to
buy
a
luxury
item
and
somebody
else
may
not
but
that
is
your
free
choice
and
there
is
no
monopoly
that
pinches
anybody
there.
now,
i've
mentioned
the
failure
to
cite
the
american
tobacco
case.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
that's
directly,
certainly.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
but
i
think
when
you
come
to
find
out
what
the
monopoly
is,
then
besides
the
market
may
has
some
bearing
on
it.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
say
what
the
court
did
--
the
grounds
upon
which
the
court
did
find
or
the
grounds
it
considered
in
finding
that
there
was
not
power
to
exclude.
it's
said
that
du
pont
did
not
prevent
it
particular
companies
from
coming
into
the
business.
well,
this
is
exercise
of
the
power
not
its
existence.
it
said
that
sylvania
come
in
and
stated,
this
is
both
exercise
of
the
power
and
the
question
of
whether
the
power
means
power
of
total
exclusion
or
something
less
than
that.
it
never
mentioned
the
exclusion
written
directly
into
the
agreement
with
la
cellophane.
it's
never
mentioned
in
connection
with
power
to
exclude.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
courts
have
held
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
this
court
has
held
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
--
that
will
be
true
if
it's
conspiracy
to
monopolize
but
not
straight
monopolization.
it's
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
it's
the
act
of
doing
it.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
the
power
alone.
well,
if
we
--
if
we
want
to
look
at
intent,
of
course,
it's
written
into
these
agreements.
du
pont
didn't
keep
--
provide
for
keeping
out
all
others
without
purpose.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
it's
necessary.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
could
i
read
what
the
court
said
in
the
griffith
case
in
334
u.s,
it
is
sufficient
that
a
restraint
of
trade,
this
is
at
page
105,
that
a
restraint
of
trade
or
monopoly
results
as
the
consequence
of
defendant's
conduct
or
business
arrangements,
it's
quoted
at
page
89
of
our
brief,
to
require
a
greater
showing
would
triple
the
act,
stated
in
the
aluminum
case.
no
monopolists
monopolizes
unconscious
of
what
he
is
doing.
specific
intent,
in
the
sense
in
which
the
common
law
used
the
term,
is
necessary
only
where
the
acts
fall
short
of
the
results
condemned
by
the
act.
now,
judge
learned
hand
in
the
aluminum
case
expressed
the
view
that
section
2
is
not
violated
if
monopoly
is
attained
solely
by
research,
superior
business
scale
or
what
have
you
and
not
accompanied
by
any
trade
restraining
conduct.
he
gave
us
an
example
of
company
which
in
free
and
fair
competition
was
the
sole
survivor
rivals
filled
by
the
wayside.
du
pont
can
get
no
comfort
out
of
this
interpretation
of
the
act.
very
foundation
of
its
monopoly
was
trade
restraining
agreements
and
agreements
which
incidentally
under
the
timken
roller
bearing
case
and
other
cases
were
clearly
an
illegal
restrain
of
trade.
furthermore,
du
pont
did
not
emerge
as
the
sole
survivor
in
a
competitive
struggle.
it
never
have
more
than
one
competitor
and
not
one
who
survived.
now,
this
moistureproof
patent
which
was
said
to
be
a
defense
to
the
monopoly
charge
and
du
pont
says
in
its
brief,
this
is
an
unprecedented
attack
from
the
patent
system
itself.
monopoly
rights
conferred
by
patent
are
to
be
respected.
but
when
they
are
blown
up,
when
the
immunity
from
the
sherman
act
asserted
in
the
name
of
monopoly
patent
rights
is
blown
up
as
it
has
been
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
deflation
is
an
order.
du
pont
had
to
go
in
monopoly
when
this
patent
issued
in
1929
issuing
the
patent
did
not
change
that
going
monopoly,
did
not
loose
its
monopoly
when
it
licensed
sylvania
in
1933,
licensing
--
if
anything
strengthened
the
monopoly
because
it
gave
du
pont
a
veto
over
sylvania's
licensing
any
third
person
under
--
under
any
later
acquired
sylvania
moistureproof
patent.
the
most
that
can
be
attributed
to
the
monopoly
rights
of
the
patent
is
that
it
gave
du
pont
a
secondary
defense
against
intrusion
into
the
part
of
the
industry
represented
by
moistureproof
cellophane.
since
no
one
ever
did
intrude
this
secondary
defense,
it
never
came
into
play.
there's
something
out
of
all
proportion
when
this
patent
is
viewed
in
relation
to
the
immunity
from
the
sherman
act
which
is
claimed
in
its
name.
on
the
one
side,
there
is
a
patent
never
adjudicated
as
to
validity,
developed
a
trifling
cost
for
applying
a
moistureproof
coating
to
cellophane
film.
on
the
other
side,
there's
the
charge
of
monopolizing
an
industry,
the
sales
in
the
year
the
patent
issued
were
$6
million
and
over
$57
million
from
the
year
it
expired,
a
charge
of
monopolizing
before
the
patent
issued
and
after
it
expired
and
the
charge
of
monopolizing
trade
in
plain
cellophane
which
was
never
within
the
scope
of
the
patent.
a
brief
makes
the
further
point
that
the
moistureproof
patent
was
used
to
implement
trade
restraining
agreements
because
it
was
brought
under
the
agreements
to
allocate
territories
and
that
--
this
use
of
the
patent
was
not
one
which
is
related
to
securing
pecuniary
reward
for
the
monopoly
given
by
the
patent.
another
patent
tainted
in
this
way
is
not
a
defense
against
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
are
claimed
to
have
been
the
process
by
which
we
reached
our
position.
those
agreements
are
not
extended.
the
first
agreement
went
out
in
1939.
the
other
agreement
relating
to
the
patent
went
out
in
1945.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
want
to
say
something
about
the
question
of
the
continuation
of
the
restraint
imposed
by
the
original
contract
with
la
cellophane
against
manufacture
in
the
united
states.
the
agreement
provided
that
la
cellophane
would
give
du
pont
an
unqualified
and
unrestricted
and
exclusive
right
to
every
process
relating
to
cellophane
manufactured,
owned
by
la
cellophane
or
which
it
may
hereafter
acquire.
and
it's
conferred
upon
du
pont
the
exclusive
right
to
manufacture
cellophane
in
north
and
central
america.
there's
no
time
limitation
on
this.
now,
this
--
a
cancellation
has
been
spoken
about.
we
refer
to
that
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief.
and
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
language
of
the
cancellation
notice.
there
are
several
of
them.
they're
all
the
same.
it's
page
32
--
3323
in
volume
5
of
the
record.
based
upon
the
provisions
in
contract,
this
just
came
from
du
pont
and
it
started
with
other
side
and
in
the
light
of
legal
developments
in
this
country.
we
construe
these
provisions,
these
agreements
as
imposing
no
restrictions
upon
the
sale
of
regenerated
cellulose
in
any
country
in
which
the
public
is
free
to
sell.
thus,
we
regard
each
party
as
free
to
export
such
film
to
any
country
in
the
world
subject
only
to
certain
limitation.
in
other
words,
we
said
about
cancellation
of
manufacturing
rights,
the
exclusive
rights
given
by
the
original
process
and
original
agreement.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
don't
--
do
not
know
of
any
case
that
has
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
held
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
--
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
that
--
that
is
where
i
would
say
at
the
very
least
this
was
not
appropriately
limited
in
time
and
circumstances.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
a
limitation
that
covers
--
covers
an
--
an
entire
continent
is
not
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
that
was
without
time
limitation.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
at
least
at
common
law,
there's
no
question
about
time
limitation.
it
had
to
be
limited
and
reasonably
limited
in
time.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case,
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
number
of
decisions
at
common
law
where
the
limitation
and
time
has
been
entered
so.
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
assignment
itself
doesn't
fit
when
you
bar
the
assignor
from
making
any
--
any
further
assignment
for
the
indefinite
future.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
can
run
forever
without
involving
imposition
of
continuing
restraints
and
in
this
case,
laying
the
foundation
from
monopoly
which
the
sherman
act
applies
to.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
this
question.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
both
sides
are
in
agreement
on
that,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
no.
no,
it
isn't.
no,
the
--
the
la
cellophane
was
contributing
what
it
had.
it
claimed
that
its
patents
had
a
good
deal
of
value
and
when
du
pont
came
to
look
into
it,
it
decided
they
didn't.
but
la
cellophane
in
good
faith
turned
over
all
its
secret
information
which
was
a
vital
importance,
its
production
line
know-how
assistance
in
getting
the
company
started
and
its
patents.
the
patents
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
of
course,
a
patent
has
a
limited
life
and
--
i
--
at
--
at
the
very
latest
patent
in
protection
against
the
sherman
act
for
17
years
on
this
theory
of
a
secret
process
that
burns
forever
can
go
even
beyond
the
immunity
which
is
sometimes
get
from
having
possession
of
patent.
now,
i
would
like
the
court
to
look
at
this
folder
that
was
passed
around
a
little
earlier
and
solely
at
the
unconverted
part
in
the
back
that
mr.
gesell
referred
to.
this
obviously
has
reference
only
on
the
question
of
transparency.
on
the
first
page,
the
only
one
that
is
clear
is
pliofilm
which
is
a
film,
in
other
words,
not
a
product.
the
two
top
in
the
next
page
are
both
films.
the
paper
one
at
the
--
at
the
bottom
are
obviously
not
clear.
then,
we
come
to
the
fourth
page
and
here
we
do
see
a
paper
product
which
is
quite
clear,
but
i
suggest
that
the
court
members,
the
court
just
lift
up
a
little
sheet
of
paper
over
the
wax
paper,
maybe
an
inch
then
look
at
the
red
thing
underneath
and
do
the
same
with
cellophane.
one
case
is
perfectly
clear
in
the
other
case
it's
so
murky
you
could
just
barely
make
out
the
outline.
another
thing,
just
take
your
thumb
nail,
likely
scratch
it
across
this
thing.
nothing
--
it's
of
--
it's
cellophane
paper,
in
effect
even
the
slightest,
it
leaves
a
permanent
blur
on
the
wax
paper.
now,
on
the
question
of
physical
characteristic,
difference
between
physical
characteristic,
cellophane
is
different
from
glassine
and
this
--
this
is
all
in
the
basis
of
the
court's
finding
and
clarity,
tear
strength,
bursting
strength,
premium
ability
--
permeability
to
gases,
dimensional
change
with
humidity
difference,
resistance
to
grease
and
oil
and
for
two
of
the
three
types
of
glassine
and
water
absorption
and
moisture
permeability.
those
facts
are
brought
up
at
page
78
and
79
of
our
brief.
wax
paper
is
different
from
cellophane
in
nine
of
the
11
physical
characteristic
properties
set
forth.
also,
at
page
45
of
our
brief,
you'll
see
set
of
--
a
little
column
near
the
bottom,
the
differences
between
cellophane
and
sulphite
paper.
now,
the
--
so,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
the
possible
question
as
to
this
being
a
--
really,
a
totally
different
product.
the
question
is
whether
competition
from
the
lower
level
so
to
speak
really
controls
cellophane's
price.
the
facts
are
incontestable
on
that
point.
cellophane,
when
it
was
way
above
the
price
was
increasing
its
sales
and
having
high
profits.
its
price
was
not
controlled
by
the
lower
price
products.
it
shows
to
drop
the
price
from
time
to
time,
get
a
larger
market,
partly
from
new
users,
partly
from
the
old
users
that
would
reduce
manufacturing
cost
and
the
increase
value
of
lower
manufacturing
cost
would
also
increase
profits.
i
think
very
little
has
been
said
if
anything
by
mr.
gesell
about
what
the
du
pont
management
thought
about
the
competition
of
these
paper
products.
it's
never
been
explained
why
the
du
pont
management,
the
top
management
left
them
out
of
consideration
when
it
was
considering
cellophane's
competition.
if
they
control
cellophane's
price,
why
wasn't
that
the
major
consideration?
it's
never
been
satisfactorily
explained
why
cellophane
forged
ahead
as
it
did,
if
it
did
not
materially
differ
functionally
from
any
other
competing
products.
the
--
these
material
differences
enabled
a
monopolist
of
the
product
to
exercise
a
degree
of
pricing
power
over
that
product
which
is
certainly
within
the
reach
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
monopolist
has
a
wide
range
when
this
other
products
or
maybe
two
and
half
times
under
its
price,
think
of
the
range.
it
practically
as
if
they
didn't
exist.
of
course,
there
would
be
some
uses
where
as
i
said
in
my
opening,
customers
will
fluctuate
because
they
will
compare
one
product
which
is
different
in
character
or
for
certain
advantages
against
another
offering
less
advantage
but
lower
price.
and
of
course,
a
numerable
findings
about
how
customers
shifted
back
and
forth
are
we
think
irrelevant.
now,
something
was
said
that
sylvania
--
does
that
mean
my
time
has
expired?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
something
was
said
that
--
near
the
end
mr.
gesell's
argument
that
sylvania
did
compete
with
du
pont
in
price.
i
take
issue
with
that.
i
think
it
is
whatever
this
system
might
before
it
would
be
found
if
anywhere
in
--
in
--
oh,
yes,
in
du
pont,
in
the
appendix
to
du
pont's
brief
under
the
heading
as
to
existence
of
price
competition
with
sylvania.
well,
if
you
look
at
that,
all
that
you
find
is
they
quoted
a
finding
with
--
same
with
the
--
after
january
1,
1947
of
a
price
differences
in
following
respects
without
noticing
the
respects.
two
of
the
respects
were
that
sylvania
had
a
higher
price
at
that
time.
that
was
a
--
in
a
condition
as
severe
undersupplied.
it
was
a
terrific
seller's
market
and
for
short
period
during
1947,
sylvania's
price
was
higher
than
du
pont.
that
is
not
price
competition.
i'm
not
talking
about
after
the
period
of
the
monopolization
charge
in
1950
and
1949.
the
other
earlier
reference
about
numerous
occasions,
it
was
competition
between
sylvania
and
du
pont's
basic
price
just
refers
to
be
sporadic
apertures
by
sylvania
from
this
list
price.
and
the
court
found
--
the
court
found
that
each
time
du
pont
issues
a
new
price
list,
sylvania
copies
its
list.
there
isn't
the
slightest
question
in
the
world
that
in
any
realistic
sense
there
was
never
any
price
competition
on
the
part
of
sylvania.
thank
you.
