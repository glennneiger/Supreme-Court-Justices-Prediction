mr.
thomas
fletcher
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
think
i
have
a
little
bit
different
view
of
the
questions
and
i
have
two
questions
presented
and
then
i
should
like
to
make
an
additional
statement
which
i
believe
would
clarify
some
of
the
questions
which
were
asked.
united
presents
two
questions
here.
its
first
question
is
whether
congress,
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause
in
enacting
the
natural
gas
act
as
a
complete
and
exclusive
scheme
of
regulation,
intended
and
provide
that
a
private
contract
fixing
rates
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
and
filed
with
the
commission
as
a
rate
schedule
should
render
inoperative
and
unenforceable.
the
rate
provisions
of
section
4
of
the
act
show
that
a
natural
gas
company
cannot
make
or
file
with
the
commission
a
change
in
rates
contemplated
and
required
by
section
4
(d)
and
so
that
the
commission
cannot
permit
or
accept,
but
must
reject
the
filing
of
a
change
in
rate
for
the
natural
gas
company
until
first
such
private
contract
is
set
aside
as
against
the
public
interest
in
a
proceeding
brought
specially
for
that
purpose.
the
second
question
united
presents
is
whether
congress
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
think
so,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
would
like
to
develop
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
believe
it
to
be.
i
believe
it
results
necessarily,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
from
section
1
(a)
considered
in
conjunction
with
particularly
sections
4
(a)
and
4
(b)
which
declare
the
public
policy
of
the
congress
and
which
set
up
yardsticks
of
prohibition
in
respect
to
the
act
following
which
the
provisions
which
my
friend
read
from
sections
4
(d)
and
(e)
i
believe
fall
naturally
into
place
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
just
a
second,
sir.
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
congress
in
the
natural
gas
act
has
empowered
the
federal
power
commission
by
its
own
order
or
the
court's
empowered
to
direct
the
commission
by
order
to
require
a
refund
of
moneys
collected
from
a
change
in
rates
for
the
sale
of
natural
gas
for
a
resale
for
industrial
use
only,
where
those
rates
are
not
subject
to
suspension
under
the
act.
those
are
the
two
questions
which
united
presents.
now,
catching
up
first
before
i
come
to
the
question
which
you
asked
me,
sir,
i
would
like
to
do
this.
in
the
original
contract,
there
was
an
expressed
provision
made
before
the
enactment
of
the
natural
gas
act,
that
the
contract
should
at
all
times
be
subject
to
all
lawful
rules,
orders
and
regulations
of
all
state
and
federal
bodies
having
lawful
jurisdiction.
this
particular
contract
or
amendment
involved
here
was
known
as
supplement
10
to
supplement
7.
it
went
from
46
to
56.
it
was
a
consent
on
the
part
of
united
to
take
less
than
the
minimum
declared
by
the
90%
or
80%
of
the
proceeds
received
by
the
distributor.
in
every
contract
and
in
every
amendment
which
was
filed,
the
commission
put
up
what
i
call
a
caveat.
the
last
one
on
the
one,
on
the
particular
contract
involved
here
is
set
verbatim
on
page
4
of
my
brief,
in
which
the
commission
said
that,
“in
permitting
these
contracts
to
be
filed,
that
act
was
not
to
be
construed
by
it
as
any
approval
of
any
contract
right
or
term,
claimed
or
asserted
by
virtue
of
the
contract
filed.”
now,
we
say
--
united
says
that
by
that
caveat,
mobile
and
united
were
wrong.
that
the
commission
did
nothing
in
permitting
supplement
10
to
supplement
7
to
be
filed,
except
to
permit
the
money
arrangement
itself
and
that
the
commission
never
at
any
time
approved
that
portion
of
the
contract
which
was
a
firm
contract
for
firm
rates
for
a
firm
period,
which
i
say
and
will
undertake
to
develop
in
a
moment
was
contrary
to
the
scheme
of
the
act.
now,
secondly,
with
this
conversion
tariff,
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
commission,
all
price
index
and
percentage
arraignments
and
tax
adjustment
clause
which
was
a
100%
of
supplement
10
to
supplement
7
were
outlawed
and
prohibited
and
we
were
compelled
to
file
a
conversion
tariff.
also,
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
commission,
section
154.85,
we
were
required
to
file
as
a
service
agreement
those
portions
of
the
several
contracts
not
superseded
and
replaced
by
the
conversion
tariff.
we
filed
that
statement
and
that
statement
showed
that
supplement
10
to
supplement
7
in
its
entirety
was
dropped
because
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
applicable
rules
and
regulations
and
that
docket
g2019
in
1952,
the
commission
ordered
that
conversion
tariff
as
to
these
rates
filed.
mobile
did
not
object
to
the
statement
that
dropped
supplement
10
to
supplement
7.
united
did
not
object.
nobody
took
a
19
(b)
appeal
and
in
the
court
below,
we
contended
under
the
sunshine
and
for
side
case
that
was
res
judicata
and
that
the
contract
thereupon
and
thereby
was
replaced
and
that
the
contract
which
the
court
below
ordered,
reinstated
had
not
been
in
existence
for
more
than
a
year.
now,
i
come
to
the
act
itself.
in
section
1
(a),
the
congress
declares
that
it
is
its
purpose
to
take
over
what
we
may
call
the
(inaudible)
gap
with
which
this
court
is
familiar.
it
said
that
that
business
was
affected
with
a
public
interest
and
required
regulation.
in
section
4
(a),
it
declared
that
all
rates
should
be
just
and
reasonable
and
that
any
rate,
not
just
unreasonable
was
unlawful.
no
exceptions,
no
provisos,
no
evens
and
buts,
either
just
unreasonable
or
unlawful.
it
did
not
rest
on
that.
it
came
to
section
4
(b)
and
it
got
specific
and
it
said,
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
charge
or
demand
or
collect
a
rate
that
is
tainted
with
undue
preference
or
advantage
or
undue
reasonableness
between
classes
of
the
same
service
or
localities.”
when
it
came
to
section
4
(c),
it
required
the
natural
gas
company
within
a
time
certain
to
file
all
rate
schedules
and
conditions
of
service.
together
with
is
the
language
of
the
act
and
the
court
will
find
that
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
on
page
3,
“together
with,”
says
the
act,
“all
contracts
relating
thereto.”
in
section
4
(b),
i
remind
you,
this
court
has
said
that
section
4
is
the
heart
of
this
act
and
as
we
go
along,
i
shall
undertake
to
describe
the
fact
that
rate-wise,
section
4
is
the
point
of
inception
and
origin
of
all
rate
business
before
the
commission.
it
is
where
the
stream
and
the
volume
of
the
commission
business
arises
and
comes
in
to
full
bloom
and
section
5
(a)
is
the
policeman
of
the
act
and
by
which
the
commission
can
dial
in
to
be
sure
that
proper
performance
is
held.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
there
is
--
there
was
a
settlement
of
the
rate
case
made,
mr.
justice
black,
and
it
was
put
into
effect
as
to
all
except
one
party
who
did
not
agree
to
it
and
except
as
to
mobile
who
undertook
to
reserve
as
of
course
it
had
the
right
to
reserve
its
position
in
this
litigation.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir,
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
now
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
think
that
is
correct,
sir.
that's
my
position
and
i
believe
that
is
the
necessary
effect
of
the
act.
now,
in
section
4
(d),
the
commission
--
i
mean,
the
act
placed
upon
the
natural
gas
company
the
duty
to
initiate
changes
in
rates.
when?
whenever
it
became
necessary
from
day-to-day
to
preserve
and
maintain
just
and
unreasonable,
what
is
just
and
unreasonable,
equal
and
uniform
application
of
the
same
rate
to
all
members
of
the
same
class
at
all
times,
and
the
statute
inception
4
(a)
did
not
accept
one
single
solitary
condition
whether
it'd
be
private
contract,
whether
it'd
be
whatever
inducements
make
a
private
contract.
now,
mobile
did
not
file
a
5
(a)
as
it
could
have
done
here
to
allege
that
any
rate
was
unreasonable.
it
first
came
in
and
asked
permission
to
intervene
in
the
case
in
which
the
increase
rates
were
sought.
that
was
granted.
it
then
filed
a
separate
proceeding,
first
on
--
i'm
sorry,
filed
in
the
same
proceeding,
a
motion
to
compel
the
commission
to
order
a
recall
of
this
order.
now,
that
case
was
a
consolidated
case.
it
involved
docket
g-2210
which
was
the
mobile
rates,
docket
g-2019
which
was
the
pipeline
rates
and
docket
g-1142
which
was
a
5
(a)
proceeding
which
the
commission
had
itself
initiated
in
1948
on
all
of
united's
rates
so
that
there
was
in
the
one
consolidated
proceeding
a
5
(a),
a
4
(e).
now,
mobile
then
sought
a
separate
collateral
proceeding
which
was
by
the
docket
g-2227
notified
a
proceeding,
mr.
justice
minton.
there
had
--
mobile
has
never
filed
a
5
(a)
proceeding
and
it
said
to
the
commission,
"we
want
you
to
recall
the
order
that
you
issued
and
a
knowledge
and
deny
the
filing
because
we
have
a
contract
and
we
have
not
consented."
and
the
commissions
says,
"your
consent
is
not
essential.
they
have
complied
with
the
statute.
this
must
be
hammered
as
the
statute
requires
and
we
deny
that."
mobile
secondly
says,
"we
want
you
to
cancel
the
consolidation
order
and
order
a
separate
hearing
as
to
mobile
solely
and
alone."
and
the
commission
says,
"no,
we
deny
that
because
this
is
a
consolidated
proceeding.
the
--
the
proceeding
is
already
underway,
evidence
is
in
course.
we
think
in
our
own
experience
is
more
helpful
to
us
to
have
the
consolidated
hearing
and
we
deny
that.”
thirdly,
mobile
says,
"we
want
you
to
cancel
and
annul
paragraph
d
of
your
order
which
permitted
these
rates
to
go
into
effect
and
substitute
an
order
denying
the
new
rates
to
become
effective
as
filed
under
section
4
(d)
and
the
commission
said,
"we
can't
do
that
because
that
would
be
improper.
we
have
no
authority
to
suspend
an
industrial
--
for
resale
rate
only.
we
can't
do
that.
we
must
go
forward
with
this
hearing."
and
that
one
was
not
raised
in
the
motion
for
a
rehearing
either.
or,
they
said,
"we
want
you
to
enter
an
order
requiring
a
refund
of
the
difference
between
the
proposed
rates
and
whatever
rates
you
finally
approved
as
an
outcome
of
the
hearing
and
the
commission
said,
"no,
we
deny
that
because
we
cannot
order
a
refund
of
a
non-suspendable
rate.
our
authority
to
refund
is
limited
solely
to
suspendable
rates
and
that
brings
the
issue
here.
now,
i'm
coming,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
if
that
be
the
case,
i
think
the
case
is
allegiant
and
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
that
hardship
and
that
matter
is
for
the
congress
and
not
for
the
court,
but
this
court
had
that
to
say
in
the
montana-dakota
case.
that
would
be
true
and
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
it
would
be
harsh.
yes,
sir?
mr.
thomas
fletcher
oh,
i
didn't
say
it
would
be
hardship
for
united,
mr.
justice
black.
no,
sir.
i
did
not
so
state
it.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
do.
i
remember
and
i
have
read
that
and
i'm
quite
familiar
with
that.
now,
the
question
then
comes.
what
was
the
intent
of
congress,
if
congress
intended
that
it
should
have
uniform
and
equal
regulation
applicable
to
all
alike,
it
would
be
wholly
obstructive
and
destructive
by
these
purposes
if
you
could
have
a
contract
that
grow
superior
to
the
statute
and
superior
to
the
purpose
and
intent
which
it
had
in
enacting
the
law.
you
simply
could
not
do
that,
otherwise,
the
even
and
uniform
application
which
in
section
1
(a),
it
specified
and
which
in
section
4
(a)
and
4
(b)
it
demanded
would
be
frustrated.
i
want
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
first,
before
i
get
in
to
the
matter,
answer
a
question
yesterday
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
mr.
wahrenbrock
in
which
i
did
not
get.
he
asked
him
a
question
in
4
(d)
whether
the
first
phrase
unless
the
commission
otherwise
orders
gave
any
additional
power.
my
understanding
of
that
phrase
is,
that
it
modifies
the
except
phrase
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
and
it
gives
power
to
the
commission
to
wave
portions
off,
but
not
all
of
the
30
days
required
notice.
the
last
sentence
of
the
section
gives
a
distinct
and
a
new
power
to
the
commission
where
for
good
cost
shown
it
can
permit
the
rate
to
become
effective
without
any
notice
whatever.
now,
i
want
to
answer
too,
if
i
may,
as
i
had
not
had
the
time
to
do,
the
suggestion
of
mr.
justice
black
about
the
question
of
the
equity
and
the
question
of
the
contract.
the
--
united
conceives
that
it
is
in
performance
of
section
4,
4
(d)
permits
a
change
in
contracts
is
our
contention.
contracts
as
used
in
section
4
(d)
is
used
in
no
different
fashion
from
that
in
section
5
(a).
no
rate
ever
becomes
final
whether
approved
under
4
(d)
or
4
(e)
rehearing
or
5
(e)
--
5
(a)
hearing
because
it
is
always
subject
to
change
by
the
commission
acting
under
the
balance
of
either
one
of
the
sections.
now,
when
this
matter
was
filed,
mobile,
as
it
should
have
done,
filed
a
proceeding
before
the
alabama
commission.
and
in
the
same
proceeding
from
which
counsel
quoted
mr.
pitman
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
on
cross-examination
by
the
commission,
the
president,
mr.
morris
of
mobile
said,
that
they
left
that
application
for
an
increase
of
the
rate
to
ideal
(inaudible)
because
their
attorneys
advised
them
that
their
earnings
was
so
very
excessive
that
the
alabama
commission
would
not
entertain
any
application
for
an
increase.
and
in
fact
they
said,
they
were
ordered
to
make
refunds
for
the
year,
i
believe,
it
was
1953.
our
position
is
and
chief
judge
hutcheson
in
the
tyler
case
held,
that
a
natural
gas
company
subject
to
the
act
could
not
stop
itself
by
contract
from
access
to
section
4
because
the
act
is
incorporated
into
and
became
a
part
of
the
contract
itself
and
that
it
was
subject
to
change
in
consideration.
now,
the
question,
i
believe,
it
was
mr.
justice
reed
of
whether,
the
contract
could
be
considered
in
a
full
rehearing.
it
has
been
consistently
our
contention
that
it
can
be,
and
this
court
in
the
midland
case,
which
involved
a
missouri
statute
that
is
precisely
like
or
so
precisely
like
that
to
add
that
the
difference
is
on
substantial.
mr.
chief
justice
taft
there
said
that
in
a
hearing
on
the
section
of
the
missouri
statute,
its
input
note
seven
of
the
opinion,
and
i
thought
i
had
5191,
yes,
5191,
which
is
like
4
(e)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
very,
very
substantially
similar
that
there,
the
hearing
was
not
only
upon
the
proposed
rate,
but
upon
the
contract
and
that
the
claimant
of
the
contract
there
had
the
right
to
defend
this
contract
and
to
adduced
for
the
commission's
consideration
what
evidence
he
had
in
support
of
it.
i
come
in
again,
if
i
may,
skipping
but
i
want
to
answer
the
court's
questions
as
i
understand
which
i
conceived
to
be
the
more
important.
i
think
my
brief
would
take
care
of
counsel.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
say's
what
is
the
gloss?
it
is
sir,
as
i
understand
it,
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
courts
hold
that
the
natural
gas
act
comes
from
it.
section
6
(3)
three
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
similar
to
section
4
(d),
and
if
i
may
digress
for
the
moment,
that
was
the
only
section
in
existence
at
the
time
of
armour's
case.
now,
i
do
not
agree,
that
there
is
any
difference
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
natural
gas
act.
when
one
reads
and
considers
the
necessary
connotations
of
section
1
(a)
in
the
light
of
sections
4
(a)
and
(b),
the
purpose
of
congress
to
take
over
the
(inaudible)
gap
and
completely
to
regulate
and
preempt
the
regulation
of
that
gap
is
as
evident
in
those
sections
as
it
was
evident
against
any
other
arrangement
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
certainly.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
but
it
does
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
and
equally
in
the
natural
gas
act,
but
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
i
understand
it,
the
word
contract
is
nowhere
used
by
an
expressed
phrase
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
arose
by
this
court's
decision
in
armour,
and
the
extent
of
the
decision
in
armour
which
only
was
after
63,
a
comparable
4
(d),
can
be
best
determined
to
my
way
of
thinking,
by
the
examination
of
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
brook,
which
in
the
most
strong
language
put
it
that
the
court
was
holding
that
by
the
filling
of
a
change
of
rates
under
section
63
comparable
to
section
4
(d)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
court
was
giving
to
a
party
bound
by
contract
the
arbitrary
i
think
was
his
term.
the
arbitrary
right
to
cancel
and
to
know
a
contract,
and
that
that
was
mischievous.
i
say
that
that
measures
the
scope
of
the
consideration
which
this
court
gave
to
armour,
and
a
statute
at
that
time
that
is
right
except
for
the
use
as
i
understand
it
of
the
word
contract
4
(d).
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
think
without
a
shatter
of
a
doubt,
it
could.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
think
that
the
question
of
what
constitutes
the
reasonableness
today
is
always
open
to
consideration
and
chief
judge
hutcheson
held
that
it
was
not
unilateral
abrogation
because
it
was
compliance
with
the
act.
now,
as
i
see
it,
mr.
justice,
section
4
is
initiated
by
the
company
and
it
has
a
continuing
duty
under
the
--
under
the
categorical
duty
of
4
(a)
and
4
(b)
to
offer
a
change
whenever
and
is
often
as
contracts
aside
because
the
statute
is
a
part
of
the
contract.
it
becomes
necessary
to
maintain
just
and
reasonable,
and
the
commission
is
never
foreclosed
by
section
5
(a).
they
are
both
equally
open
to
the
commission
upon
the
filling
by
the
company
or
initiation.
the
company
cannot
initiate
the
5
(a).
it
can
under
the
power
act,
the
natural
gas
company
can't
file
a
complaint
under
section
5
(a).
nobody
but
the
public
guardians
that
is
the
state
or
the
federal
power
commission
or
the
distributor
the
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
my
proposition,
mr.
justice
black,
is
and
i
understand
it
to
be
i
think
sustained
by
the
cases
i
have
cited,
that
whenever
any
provision
of
a
private
contract
comes
in
to
conflict
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
pro
tanto
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
pro
tanto,
the
conflict
with
the
act,
the
–
the
subject
matter
committed
the
regulation,
no.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
certainly,
not
because
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
--
of
the
contract
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
not
because
of
the
contract,
but
because
it
was
the
filed
rate.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
i
think
it's
obligation
to
buy
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
certainly,
mr.
justice
black,
but
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
its
obligation.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
my
difference
with
your
statement,
mr.
justice,
is,
that
it's
not
a
change,
as
i
please,
whenever
i
plead.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
think
that
it
is
a
change
on
the
section
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
not
at
will,
no.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
because
when
we
filed
under
4
(d),
the
information
we
attached
to
the
filing
is
tantamount
to
a
prima
facia
rate
case
and
it
cannot
become
effective
unless
the
commission
permits
it
saved
in
the
one
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
say
it
in
that
1
(a)
writ.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
now,
that
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
now
the
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
oh,
they
can
do
something
about
it
though,
mr.
justice
black.
they
can
enter
as
they
ordered
here
the
full
rehearing.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
act
itself.
that's
not
my
act.
that's
the
provision
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
reason
void
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
in
the
reason,
if
you
let
me
answer
this
way
i'll
give
you,
yes.
the
reason
for
it
is,
as
i
understand
it,
the
federal
trade
commission
report,
which
is
referred
to
in
section
1
(a)
and
which
induced
the
act,
itself
said
that
the
competition
in
industrial
rates
was
a
different
class
and
was
itself
so
fears
that
that
was
not
necessary
to
be
regulated
whatever,
and
this
is
a
resale
rate
and
for
that
reason,
this
resale
rate
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
act.
and
the
--
and
the
congress,
for
whatever
wisdom
it
had,
whether
it
was
wise
or
not,
did
provide
and
prohibit
the
suspension
of
a
rate
where
it
was
for
an
industrial
resale
only.
now
why
that
was,
i
don't
know,
sir.
but
it
is
in
the
law
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
my
statement
is,
mr.
justice
black,
that
when
i
am
under
the
compulsion,
as
i
think
the
natural
gas
company
is
by
section
4
to
propose
a
change
whenever,
it
is
necessary
to
meet
the
statutory
obligation
of
just
and
reasonable.
it
is
not
my
act,
it
is
not
my
whim,
it
is
not
my
caprice,
it
is
my
statutory
duty.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
the
issue
for
you
to
decide
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
the
issue,
if
you
let
me
answer
this
question,
i'll
come
to
your
question.
i
want
to
answer
your
question
if
i
can.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
but
i
don't
think
we
abrogated,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
as
changed
and
modified
by
the
act,
which
is
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
the
issue
to
be
decided,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
is
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
right.
and
the
question
here
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
the
question
here
is,
did
congress
by
the
natural
gas
act,
stipulate
that
that
was
superior
to
the
act?
if
they
did,
we
make
contracts.
if
they
didn't,
and
i
understand
they
didn't
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
with
the
difference,
that's
what
i
suggest
as
the
case
here.
thank
you.
