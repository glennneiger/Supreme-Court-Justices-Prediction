unknown
speaker
is
there
some
explanation
as
to
why
it's
not
been
repealed?
what
--
what's
the
good
reason
for
that
exception.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
part
of
section
4?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
suggestion
that
he
made
some
place
that
was
not
--that
was
--
it
is
put
in
there
because
they're
in
a
position
to
pass
it
on?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you?
your
--
your
statement
of
facts
has
sent
me
a
little
confused
as
to
this
question.
have
you
properly
stated
the
question
on
page
2
of
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
is
your
position
is
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
that
applies
only
to
what
was
sold
to
the
mobile
for
resale
to
other
clients?
unknown
speaker
not
for
consumption?
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
then
that
united
had
the
right
under
the
statute
to
raise
this
rate
by
filing
this
increased
rate
whether
the
commission
wanted
to
or
not?
and
been
--
it
had
then
be
attacked
and
revised
afterwards
and
they
--
had
the
right
and
the
commission
didn't
permit
it,
but
the
company
under
the
statute
raised
it.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
would
you
mind
pointing
to
the
statute
which
you
say
permits
that
contract
to
be
changed
that
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understood
you
to
my
other
question
that
means
that
in
(inaudible)
specific
provision
in
the
statute
that
says
that
very
thing.
the
power
commission
has
recommended
against
that
provision
and
would
like
to
have
it
changed,
but
it
hasn't
been
changed.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
proviso
about
two-thirds
the
way
down.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
i
understand
the
challenge
is
now
pending
here.
unknown
speaker
the
only
question
we
have
here
is
the
power
of
suspension
between
the
time
it
was
put
in
and
what
is
passed
on
by
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
that
means
to
me.
perhaps,
i
don't
fully
understand
it.
that
the
only
question
we
have
here
is
a
temporary
--
it's
a
permanent
rate,
i
would
--
maybe.
unknown
speaker
but
it
only
last
from
the
time,
so
long
--
until
the
commission
can
get
to
it
to
say
whether
it's
validated
or
invalidated.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
requirement
of
the
commission
that
money
being
paid
in
over
the
old
contract
rate
should
be
paid
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
says
now
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
it
does
above
it?
i
just
looked
at
it.
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
find
just
where
the
commission
claims
its
bar
from
forcing
a
company
to
abide
by
its
contract
unto
the
hearing.
unknown
speaker
as
to
industrial?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that's
because
you
can't
make
a
fixed
contract
since
you
might
make
--
a
gas
company
might
make
it
so
low
that
they'll
put
all
the
burden
carrying
a
gas
on
others?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
has
--
as
i
understand
it
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
customer
objects?
unknown
speaker
but
no
section
5
(a)
proceeding
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
could
you
file
under
5?
unknown
speaker
well
is
it
--
is
it
strict
the
unilateral
in
the
--
and
there's
to
be
--
there
maybe
some
action
taken
by
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
well
before
--
before
we
got
to
5
(a)
and
back
at
the
beginning
of
the
proviso
in
4
(e)
provided
that
the
commission
shall
not
have
authority
to
suspend
the
rate
charge
classification
for
the
sale
of
natural
gas
for
resale.
now,
is
it
your
argument
that
--
that
is
true
so
far
as
any
sale
of
natural
gas
for
resale
is
concern
except
where
there
is
a
specific
contract?
unknown
speaker
well
--
so
you
think
there
is
no
contract
at
all
if
they're
merely
purchases
under
the
general
rate.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
the
written
contract
of
--
(inaudible)
subsidiary
comes
in
and
says
we
want
to
buy
gas
at
your
regular
rate
for
industrial
use.
is
that
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
is
your
view
of
the
first
sentence
of
that
proviso?
what
does
it
apply
to?
that
first
clause
--
unknown
speaker
and
says
that
that
cannot
be
suspended.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it
can
be
suspended
so
far
as
the
contract
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
but
its
contract
or
not
contract,
you
can't
suspend.
unknown
speaker
well
congress
authorized
this
change
by
statute,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well
it
says
that
it
can't
change
its
rates,
the
utility
can't
change
its
rate
except
by
filing
a
schedule
and
giving
30
days
notice.
unknown
speaker
that
would
seem
to
indicate
that
they
can
do
it
that
way,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
if
a
contract
that
is
subject
to
regulation
maybe
changed
by
the
--
by
the
regulatory
power.
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
manner
that
congress
has
provided,
may
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
contract
maybe
--
maybe
changed.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
delegate
it
to
the
company
to
do
it
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
delegate
it
to
the
company
to
do
it,
to
make
a
change
under
the
statute.
it
--
it
--
the
change
is
made
by
filing
a
--
a
change
of
schedule
or
rates
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
--
the
reasonableness
of
this
rate
is
under
investigation
by
the
commission,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
oh,
sure
not.
unknown
speaker
but
the
reasonableness
of
the
new
rate
--
unknown
speaker
and
they
said
if
it
is
unreasonable,
why
--
it's
out.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
isn't
--
isn't
that
very
matter
before
the
commission
now?
unknown
speaker
--
as
to
the
validity
--
as
to
the
validity
of
the
proposed
increase?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
reasonable
--
unknown
speaker
all
right
--
unknown
speaker
--
of
the
new
rates
--
unknown
speaker
all
right,
it's
the
new
rates.
unknown
speaker
now
that's
--
that's
before
the
commission
now.
unknown
speaker
and
this
--
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
precisely
what's
before
us
here.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
--
let
--
let
me
state
my
difficulty.
as
i
understand,
the
court
of
appeals
directed
that
the
commission
go
ahead
with
the
hearing
and
set
aside
certain
orders
that
they
had
entered.
and
the
order
that's
objected
to
here
is,
whether
under
the
natural
gas
act
of
the
power
commission
may
become
the
effect
--
let
this
become
effect
to
the
schedule,
increasing
the
rate.
unknown
speaker
now,
isn't
that
all
we
have
up
here
before
us?
unknown
speaker
not
the
question
of
the
validity
of
your
contract
but
a
question
of
the
statutory
interpretation
as
to
whether
it
goes
into
effect
before
or
after
the
commission
completes
its
hearing?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
you're
right.
unknown
speaker
well
i'm
assuming,
if
the
contract
is
not
going
to
be
abrogated,
it's
a
valid
contract,
it
will
eventually
be
found
to
be
a
valid
contract
and
they
will
refuse
to
allow
the
entry.
but
isn't
the
question
that
we
have
here
pending
that
determination
whether
or
not
your
rate
continues.
unknown
speaker
the
rate
continues.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
the
filed
rate
remains
in
the
books.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
--
unknown
speaker
--
then
i
am
faced
with
something
that
i
asked
you
about
before
the
very
beginning
of
the
proviso,
provided
that
the
commission
shall
not
have
authority
to
suspend
the
rate,
charge
classification
or
service
for
the
sale
of
natural
gas
for
resale.
because
as
i
understand
that
you
say
that
applies
only
to
those
that
do
not
have
a
contract.
unknown
speaker
well
you
filed
the
petition
before
the
commission,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
did
you
ask?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
those
parts
of
the
commission's
order,
which
dismissed
your
petition,
should
be
eliminated.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
where
you
are
now.
unknown
speaker
well
i
think
--
grant
it
now
because
the
case
has
been
brought
up
here
by
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
where
--
where
is
the
--
where
is
your
petition
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
here's
our
petition.
i
think
we
made
petitions
in
mobile
somewhere
in
the
first
pages
sir,
the
petition
is
on
page
7.
unknown
speaker
these
are
amendments
and
i
have
difficulty
in
reading
of
it.
unknown
speaker
there
was
an
amendment
made,
the
very
first
thing
in
the
record.
