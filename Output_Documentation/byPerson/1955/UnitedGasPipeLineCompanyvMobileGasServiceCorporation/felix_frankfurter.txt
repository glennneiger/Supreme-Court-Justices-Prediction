justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wahrenbrock,
i
would
like
to
permit
to
ask
the
preliminary
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
make
it
clear.
do
i
understand
that
there
is
no
power
in
the
policy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
settled?
and
when
you
come
to
a
point
on
the
statute
--
the
legislation
is
clear,
that
the
commission
would
be
prohibited
to
suspend
a
rate
which
changes
theretofore
an
existing
legal
contract
clear?
is
the
statute
clear
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
power
even
this
case
that
the
statute
--
the
congress
has
said
in
appropriate
language
that
you
could
not,
reading
the
legislation
say
that
in
case
where
a
rate
implies
which
displaces,
disadvantageous,
an
outstanding
contract
even
in
that
case,
you
cannot
suspend
a
newly
filed
higher
rate
long
enough
to
take
a
look,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
any
other
--
is
that
the
only
ground
that
congress
hasn't
made
the
specific
recommendation?
often,
congress
doesn't
pass
an
act
(inaudible)
how
do
you
come
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
(c)
and
(d).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
bring
in
contract
under
the
suspension
clause
of
(e).
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
if
the
charge
(inaudible)
do
i
read
in
--
reading
in
haste
that
the
changed
schedule
can
take
effect
for
30
days,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
30-days
in
which
something
can
be
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
to
present
the
commission
when
it
change
of
an
existing
contract
rate
to
put
the
case
down
for
a
rehearing
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
pleadings
and
--
even
though
the
hearing
is
under
way,
it
has
no
power,
it
can't
delay
the
effectuation
of
the
date.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
rule
that
the
commission
rules
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
when
you
read
the
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
want
to
know
is
if
there
had
been
any
interpretation
of
this,
except
the
old
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
get
your
clause
on,
“unless
the
commission
otherwise
ordered.”
what
is
your
thought
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
i
--
i
can
do
all
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
but
why
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(inaudible)
doesn't
tell
me
that.
that
will
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
otherwise
orders,
but
then,
there's
a
specific
--
there's
a
specific
requirement,
namely,
that
in
any
event
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
told
by
you
that
the
commission
cannot
if
it
wants
to
suspend
this.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that's
appropriate
by
the
legislation.
and
i
find
only
this
--
the
commission
otherwise
ordered,
accept
that
for
30
days
it
can
be
in
effect,
accept
that
for
30
days.
if
i
were
restricted
to
those
words,
i
could
find
what
the
commission
otherwise
ordered.
my
orders
can't
be
for
three
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
through
all
the
provision
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
(inaudible)
that
i'm
agreeing
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
specific
provision
of
the
statute
for
that
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
cannot
be
done
in
that
situation
to
what
you
call
your
first
question
covered
by
the
specific
provision
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
argument
that
if
i
have
to
file
here,
it
should
be
found
to
be
unreasonable
this
new
rate
that
it
was
unreasonable
from
the
beginning
and
therefore
you
will
end
up
being
rich
for
hanging
on
something
that
doesn't
belong
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
a
matter
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
meant
whether
montana
gets
hardship
for
some
of
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
it
can
be
suspended,
there
is
time
to
make
that
determination,
if
it
cannot
--
there
isn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
chanler,
may
i
--
just
to
--
to
be
able
to
listen
more
intelligently
to
what
you
unfolds
here.
as
for
the
--
(inaudible)
from
what
you've
said
(inaudible)
that
4
applies
when
there
is
no
governing
outstanding
contract
rate,
5
applies
when
there
is
contract
rate,
i
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
it
doesn't?
as
i
understand
it
on
the
argument
where
it
states
your
position,
you
agree
that
the
existing
contract
rate
comes
under
the
restrictions
of
4
as
against
changes
and
so
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
i
not
--
did
not
--
in
what
you're
about
to
argue,
that
if
there
is
such
an
outstanding
contract,
then,
it
must
be
dealt
with
under
4
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
form
of
agreement,
then
there
is
a
contest
filed
in
the
controlling
state,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
chanler,
to
clear
out
my
difficulty,
(inaudible)
difficulty
i
have
in
your
argument
is
that
section
5
is
not
restricted
to
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
equally
applicable
to
a
previously
filed
tariff,
having
known
such
considerations
as
that
which
is
raised
by
a
contract
namely
--
great
reliance
on
its
law
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
in
forcing
your
argument
seems
to
be
(inaudible)
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
deal
with
it
but
--
but
that's
my
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
dealing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we're
dealing
here
with
a
contract
which
you
will
recall
(inaudible)
has
a
congenital
defect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
chanler,
before
you
get
to
either
with
your
arguments
in
this
case
for
the
ample
time
that
you
can
have
on
the
other
case,
would
you
be
good
enough
(inaudible)
that
section
4,
by
section
4,
congress
divides
what
i
should
like
to
call
an
interlocutory
scheme
and
section
5
is
the
--
is
the
procedure
for
a
final
disposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this?
section
4
doesn't
expose
the
rates
that's
filed
and
it
doesn't
involve
the
contract,
does
it?it
--
that
doesn't
concluded
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
then
let
it
go
into
effect
(inaudible)
that
--
suppose
that
section
5
doesn't
apply,
namely,
it
may
let
it
go
into
effect
and
yet
(voice
overlap)
on
the
face
of
it
mean
not
unreasonable
within
this
area
of
reasonableness
as
you
know
but
on
further
and
fuller
final
inquiry
it
may
add
in
the
case
of
interlocutory
and
final
injunction
conclude
that
the
originally
interlocutory
injunction
can't
stand
final
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
they
may,
having
allowed
it
to
stand
under
4,
somebody
from
--
alert
citizens,
they
look
at
here
and
your
counsel
(inaudible)
you
say
they
may
then
proceed
under
5.
when
you
say
that,
new
rates
for
me
is
the
difficulty
that
i
have.
i
have
difficulties
with
the
other
side
and
i
have
difficulty
with
your
side,
namely,
it
seems
that
the
2,
4,
and
5
aren't
just
valid
sections.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
notwithstanding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sections.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
therefore,
i
have
to
--
i
have
to
find
the
meaning
by
bringing
them
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
but
the
contract
has
been
found
(inaudible)
number
5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
--
it
was
the
contract
but
it's
found
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
inadequate
to
return.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
reason
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
and
follow
your
argument
mr.
chanler.
you
say
that
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
elkins
act
and
the
hepburn
act
for
all
practical
purposes
outlaw
an
existing
arrangement
between
shippers
and
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unlike
that
which
were
therefore
all
were
prior
to
a
case
where
a
shipment
were
made
before
the
elkins
act
on
a
rebate,
it
was
not
arguable
by
the
elkins
act.
but
payment
made
subsequent
even
that
would
disallow
the
(inaudible).
what
you
say
under
the
--
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
opposite
is
applied
congress
build
on
existing
industrial
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it
presuppose
their
social
value
or
rightness
as
an
existing
(inaudible).
it
gave
ample
room
for
their
chain
if
they
should
be
either
too
high
or
too
low.
what
you
say
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
that
which
is
reasonable
may
play
anywhere
between
10
cents
and
15
cents
so
far
as
profit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
concerned.
if
this
issue
is
merely
the
validity
of
(inaudible)
it
submerge
the
system
of
contract
by
fixing
the
issue
before
a
commission
nearly
on
whether
an
unrelated
new
schedule
is
in
it
of
itself
(inaudible)
and
that
presupposes
and
presumably
defeat
the
underlying
presupposition
of
the
statute
and
therefore
no
construction
should
be
given
to
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
are
you
going
to
speak
either
now
or
later
on
what
has
been
indicated
to
us
as
to
construction
administrative
practice
uniformity
of
pleading
attached
to
the
scheme.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
face
of
something
part
of
the
commission,
mr.
chanler,
what
you've
just
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
proceedings
before
the
commission
labels
section
4
and
section
5
considering
the
way
it
considers
before
the
argument
labeled
section
4
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
section
4
or
5
doctrine
where
there
is
before
the
icc,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
citation
of
this
six
circuit
deal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
date
of
the
decision
mr.
chanler
we
can
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
title?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
power
mr.
fletcher
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
as
to
power
and
that
one
in
controversy
but
--
but
isn't
there
a
profound
difference,
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chanler,
in
that,
the
interstate
commerce
act
cut
out
all
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
gives
them.
it
meant
to
give
them
because
of
mischievous
situation
about
rebates
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
one
mr.
fletcher.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
view
with
the
power
commission
in
considering
your
newly
filed
rate,
never
mind
this
new
(inaudible)
would
the
commission
in
its
hearing
regarding
your
new
rate
consider
to
operate
the
outstanding
contract
and
say
we
have
found
that
this
we
find
that
this
contract
during
its
duration,
the
cause
of
its
duration
and
the
income
and
the
revenues
and
exactly,
we
find
that
unreasonable
rate,
we
will
change
it,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
could
--
you
couldn't
have
a
comparable
situation
(inaudible)
