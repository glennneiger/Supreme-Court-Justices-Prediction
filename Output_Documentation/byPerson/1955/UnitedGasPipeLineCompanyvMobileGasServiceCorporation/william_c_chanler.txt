mr.
william
c.
chanler
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset,
it's
important
to
try
and
determine
just
what
the
issue
is
--
how
it
got
here.
the
issue
is
really
a
very
simple
one.
mobile
and
united
--
united
is
a
natural
gas
pipe
line
and
mobile,
a
local
gas
distributing
company
in
the
city
of
mobile,
entered
into
a
contract
in
1946
whereby,
united
agreed
to
furnish
mobile
all
the
gas
needed
by
it
for
a
particular
resale
with
the
ideal
cement
company
at
a
fix
rate
for
a
period
of
10
years.
in
1953,
united,
by
unilateral
action
of
filing
a
schedule
of
higher
rates,
sought
to
increase
the
contract
rate.
the
issue
is
whether,
under
the
natural
gas
act,
a
contract
between
two
utility
companies
for
the
sale
of
gas
at
a
fixed
rate
for
a
term
of
years
maybe
aggregated
unilaterally,
by
the
natural
gas
company
by
the
mere
act
of
filling
a
schedule
of
increase
or
whether
the
contract
is
valid
and
binding
between
the
parties
until
and
unless
it
has
been
set
aside
by
the
federal
power
commission
after
a
hearing
and
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
contract
is
against
the
public
interest.
the
case
gets
--
reaches
this
court
under
the
following
circumstances.
as
i
said,
this
contract
was
entered
into
in
1946.
it
was
a
modification
of
an
earlier
contract
entered
into
in
1936,
the
modification
downward.
united
agreed
to
sell
this
gas
for
the
resale
to
the
ideal
cement
company
at
a
special
low
rate,
so
that
mobile
could
make
a
contract
in
turn
with
the
ideal
cement
company,
the
new
company
in
the
area.
when
united
filed
its
schedule
to
increase
the
rates
under
section
4
(d)
of
the
act
--
i'll
go
into
the
meaning
of
the
section
a
moment.
mobile
filed
a
petition
with
the
federal
power
commission
alleging
that
its
contract
rate
could
not
be
changed
by
a
mere
filing
and
asking
that
the
filing
be
rejected
and
without
prejudice,
of
course,
to
a
hearing
under
5
(a)
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract.
the
commission
denied
our
petition
and
dismissed
our
proceeding,
so
that
the
rate
went
into
effect.
there
was
some
talk
yesterday
as
to
the
fact
that
it
went
into
effect
without
suspension.
that's
not
really
material
to
the
main
issue
here.
we
don't
like
this.
we
would
like
to
have
it
suspended
but
in
the
other
case,
it
will
be
argued
in
a
minute.
there
was
a
suspension
and
the
same
issue
arises.
the
question
is
not
whether
it
can
be
suspended.
the
question
is
whether
the
rate
can
be
changed
before
the
contract
has
been
itself
found
to
be
against
the
public
interest.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
sir,
that
determination,
the
real
--
when
we
come
to
discussing
the
statute,
i
will
point
out
that
the
real
question
we
had
here
on
statutory
construction
is,
that
when
you
construe
the
statute
carefully
you'll
find
that
in
a
hearing
commenced
by
a
filing
under
4
(d),
you
never
reach
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract
because
section
4
(d)
and
(e)
merely
authorized
the
commission
to
have
all
the
hearing
and
pass
upon
the
reasonableness
of
the
proposed
new
rate.
and
when
you
come
to
study
the
act,
i
think
it
can
easily
be
seen.
as
the
courts
below
held
that
the
proposed
new
rates
might
be
reasonable
and
therefore,
would
have
to
be
approve
in
a
4
(d)
proceeding
even
though
the
contract
rate
was
also
reasonable.
and
it's
for
that
reason,
that
we
insist
and
the
courts
below
agreed
for
this,
that
you
cannot
touch
a
contract
rate
until
after
the
contract
has
been
found
unreasonable.
and
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
in
5
(a).
so
that
a
suspension
under
4
(e)
gives
us
five
months
less
time
during
which
our
contract
is
being
violated
but
in
the
end,
the
rate
can
still
be
increased
as
it
was
in
the
other
case
even
though
i
think
it's
easily
demonstrable
there
that
the
contract
rate
was
perfectly
reasonable.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no,
sir.
we
didn't
file
under
5.
there
was
no
reason
for
us
to
file
under
5.
the
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh
we
would
want
to
file
under
5.
we
think
our
contract
is
all
right.
we
have
no
objection
to
our
contract,
we
think
it
should
be
sustained.
just
to
make
it
clear,
i
would
go
into
more
detail
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
act
in
a
moment.
but
section
4
is
the
act
provides
for
the
filling
of
rates
by
a
commission.
it's
printed
at
page
101
of
mr.
wahrenbrock's
brief
where
he
read
from
it
yesterday.
4
(c)
provides
that
under
such
rules
and
regulations
the
commission
may
prescribed
every
natural
gas
company
shall
file
with
the
commission
within
60
days
of
the
passage
of
the
act.all
schedules
showing
all
--
schedules
showing
all
rates
and
at
the
bottom
together
with
all
contracts,
which
in
any
manner,
affect
or
relate
to
such
rates.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
not
quite.
let
me
explain
what
4
means
here,
and
i
think
i
can
answer
your
honors
question.
4
(d)
--
well
4
(c)
says
if
there's
a
contract,
it
must
be
filed.
4
deals
with
contracts.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
4
(d)
says,
unless
the
commission
otherwise
orders,
no
change
shall
be
made
by
any
natural
gas
company
in
any
such
rate
or
contract
except
after
30
days
notice
to
the
commission
and
to
the
public.
in
other
words,
that
provision
prevents
the
parties
to
a
contract
from
secret
of
changing
their
rates
by
amending
their
contracts.
they've
got
to
tell
the
commission
before
they
can
change
the
rate.
mr.
wahrenbrock
says,
“that's
the
provision
that
authorizes
the
company
to
unilaterally
change
the
rate
because
it
says
no
company
may
--
natural
gas
company
may
not
change
a
contract
rate
without
30
days
notice,
because
that
means
they
can
change
it
unilaterally
with
30
days
notice."
well
obviously,
you
can't
change
a
contract
unilaterally
and
this
is
very
clearly
specified
in
the
act.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
that
again
is
the
substance
of
the
discussion
that
i
will
come
to
when
i've
set
the
--
when
i
show
you
just
how
it
arises.
it's
quite
technical
to
see
how
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
unless
the
parties
agree
to
the
change.
if
the
parties
themselves
have
negotiated
a
change
then,
the
natural
gas
company
files
the
propose
new
contract
rate
under
4
(d).
then
the
commission,
where
it
can
suspend
--
suspends,
where
it
cannot
lets
it
go
into
effect
and
holds
a
hearing
if
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
new
rate,
obviously,
they
want
to
see
whether
the
parties
got
together
and
put
in
an
exorbitant
rate
for
their
own
purposes,
or
something
like
that.
so
the
commission
then
looks
at
the
increase
contract
rate
just
as
it
looks
at
any
rate
increase.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
contract,
every
congressman
knows
that
a
contract
means
that
a
contract
can't
be
changed
unilaterally
and
when
they
said
you
can't
change
a
contract
rate
without
notice,
congress
assume
that
of
course
previously
the
change
had
been
agreed
to
between
the
parties.
this
court
so
held
in
the
case
many
years
ago
in
a
kansas
statute
that
a
provision
of
this
kind
was
a
notice
provision.
now
under
4
(e),
whenever
such
schedules
of
the
--
has
been
filed,
the
commission
may
on
complaint
on
its
own
motion
enter
into
a
hearing
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
such
rate
charge
classification.
in
order
words
of
the
new
rate
not
the
lawfulness
of
the
change
but
the
new
rate
and
if
after
a
hearing
--
during
a
hearing,
it
can
suspend
except
it
can't
suspend
these
commercial
resale.
there
was
so
much
talk
about
it
yesterday,
i'll
give
you
the
reason
for
that.
at
the
hearings
before
congress,
the
congressman
who
was
proposing
this
provision,
congressman
lee
stated
just
what
it
was.
he
said
why
resale
contracts
for
industrial
use
only
--
resales
for
industrial
only
are
usually
embodied
in
short-term
contracts.
and
those
don't
have
to
be
suspended
and
the
reason
they
don't
have
to
be
suspended
is
that
if
they're
binding
contracts,
the
rate
can't
be
change
for
both
parties
have
agreed
so
there's
no
reason
to
suspend
it.
that's,
i'm
sure,
the
reason
for
that
exception.
and
anyway,
that's
its
effect,
but
we're
not
concerned
and
perhaps
they
shouldn't
digress
about
the
suspending
question,
it
doesn't
help
as
much.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
4
(e)
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
--
speaks
of
a
hearing
on
the
new
rate
proposed
under
4
(d)
and
4
(d)
means
a
new
rate
whether
or
not
on
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
that's
right
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
in
4
(e),
they
can
investigate
the
proposed
new
rate.
then
after
full
hearings
completed
either
before
or
after
the
rates
goes
into
effect,
the
commission
may
make
such
orders
with
reference
thereto
as
would
be
proper
in
a
proceeding
initiated
after
it
had
become
effective.
well
that
shows
us
into
5
(a).
5
(a)
deals
in
what
the
commission
can
do
in
the
case
of
an
existing
rate.
5
(a)
says
that
whenever
the
commission
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
--
when
there's
a
contract
they
can't
change
it
under
4
at
all
so
the
provision
doesn't
come
in.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh
--
well
if
there
is
a
contract
and
the
parties
have
agreed
to
a
change,
it
cannot
be
suspended.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no.
let
me
--
well,
i
--
i
want
to
give
a
little
time
to
what
i
mean
by
contracts
here
in
a
moment.
it's
quite
important
to
understand
that.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
it
provides
for
any
proposed
change
of
a
rate
in
a
sale
by
a
natural
gas
company
to
a
local
distributing
company
for
resale
by
the
local
distributing
company
for
industrial
use.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
that
cannot
be
suspended.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no
sir.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
a
contract
or
not.
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
that's
right.
and
i
think
the
reason
is
--
were
stated
before
congress,
that
there
was
always
--
there
are
always
contracts
in
these
industrial
sales
because
industrial
companies
always
insist
of
these
contracts.
now
i'll
bring
that
up
later
on.
it's
very
important
to
understand
that.
they
always
have
contracts
for
industrial
sales,
and
if
they
have
contracts
and
the
contracts
are
binding,
as
i
think
they
clearly
are,
there's
no
need
to
suspend
the
change
when
the
buyer
has
agreed
to
the
change.
that's
the
reason
for
it,
but
i
don't
think
it
affects
the
real
merits
of
our
case.
now
in
5
(a)
provides
that
whenever
the
--
the
commission,
after
a
hearing,
had
it
by
its
own
motion
or
on
complaint
shall
find
that
at
any
rate
charge,
skip
down
all
contract
affecting
such
rate
is
at
page
103
(inaudible)
shall
find
that
at
any
rate,
all
contract
affecting
such
rate
is
unjust,
unreasonable,
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential.
the
commission
shall
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
charge
--
that's
the
case
and
so
forth
and
shall
fix
the
same
by
order.
in
other
words,
congress
said,
“if
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
contract
or
an
existing
rate,
the
commission
shall
hold
hearings
and
if
it
is
the
contract
rate
or
the
existing
rate
just
the
filed
rate,
is
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential,
or
exorbitant.
if
there's
anything
wrong
with
it,
then,
they
may
set
it
aside,
and
we
maintain
that
that
is
a
delegation
by
congress
to
the
federal
power
commission,
authority
of
congress
to
abrogate
contract
when
the
public
interest
requires
it.
that
it
is
an
exclusive
delegation
of
power
and
that
there
cannot
be
any
delegation
of
power
to
the
natural
gas
company
to
change
its
contract
by
a
mere
filing
under
section
4.
the
real
question
is
whether
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
of
what
sir?
mr.
william
c.
chanler
if
they
could
change
it
--
it
wouldn't
be
a
contract.
so
that
in
other
way
of
approaching
this
question
is,
did
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
power
act
is
exactly
the
same,
did
congress
intend
to
outlaw
all
rate
contract
in
this
business
the
way
this
court
had
held
that
it
did
when
it
enacted
the
interstate
commerce
act.
as
we
all
know,
the
mottley
case
--
mottley
had
a
contract
be
carried
free
which
he
proceed
with
settlement
of
an
accident,
which
he
lost
his
leg
and
then
when
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
passed,
this
court
held
--
congress
has
the
undoubted
power
to
violate
to
abrogate
contracts
and
congress
has
said
that
nobody
maybe
carried
on
the
railroad
except
in
accordance
with
the
published
rate
and
mr.
mottley
lost
his
rights.
then
came
the
armour
case
which
my
friends
rely
on
very
much
in
their
briefs
in
which
i
wish
to
allude
to
because
i
think
it
illustrates
clearly
the
difference
between
the
act
--
i've
just
been
describing
the
gas
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act.
armour
had
a
contract
for
the
transportation
of
its
brief
--
at
a
special
low
rate
with
the
railroad
company
almost
indicted
under
the
elkins
law
and
said,
“oh
you're
operating
under
a
legal
contract.”
and
this
court
said,
“no,
you
can't
operate
under
the
contract.”
the
interstate
commerce
act
doesn't
recognize
contracts.
i'm
reading
now
from
pages
14
and
15
of
my
brief
in
the
armour
case.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
the
filling
of
contracts
with
shippers,
and
no
method
of
making
them
public
defined
in
the
statute.
if
the
rates
are
subject
to
secret
alteration
by
special
agreement,
then,
the
statute
would
fail
of
its
purpose.
to
establish
a
rate
known
to
work
and
then
in
answer
to
armour's
suggestion
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
allow
contracts
in
some
portions
of
the
railroad
industry,
this
court
said,
“it
may
be
that
such
contracts
should
be
recognized
giving
stability
for
limited
periods
that
the
contracts
being
filed,
and
published,
and
the
rate
stipulated
known
an
opened
wall,
no
injustice
would
be
done.
but
as
we
have
said,
such
considerations
address
themselves
to
congress
not
to
the
courts.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
will
try
in
--
i
can't
deal
with
it
directly
because
it
is
a
rather
complicated
question
that
i
--
i
think
until
you'll
see
the
answer
to
it
in
a
moment.
but
i've
just
pointed
out
this
court
suggested
that
the
contracts
might
be
alright
if
they
were
filed.
and
in
the
gas
act,
congress,
gave
just
that
and
provided
that
they
should
be
filed.
and
that
all
changes
must
be
filed.
now,
that
means
that
a
contract
rate
must
be
publicly
filed
like
any
filed
rate,
published
rate
that
isn't
embodied
in
the
contract
in
exactly
the
same
way.
but
that
does
not
mean,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
a
contract
isn't
binding.
and
if
you
assume
that
a
contract
is
binding,
as
congress
must
have
assumed
when
they
use
the
words
and
did
not
use
it
in
the
commerce
act,
and
referred
to
it
in
the
hearings,
then,
it's
obvious
that
a
contract
rate
cannot
be
changed
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
--
by
the
company
merely
finding
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well,
it
has
the
congenital
defect,
sir,
that
it
may
be
changed
by
the
paramount
power
of
government
when
the
public
interest
so
requires
and
the
question
is,
how
did
congress
provide
that
it
should
be
changed
and
congress
in
5
(a)
says
that
when
the
commission
finds
that
any
existing
rate
or
any
contract
is
against
the
public
interest,
it
may
set
it
aside
in
fixed
new
rates.
that
is
the
only
way
we
maintain
under
which
a
contract
may
be
changed.
now
i
believe
it
was
--
judge
burton
--
judge
minton
said,
why
did
i
say
that
if
the
company
could
change
the
rate
by
a
mere
filling
under
section
4,
this
constituted
a
unilateral
abrogation
of
the
contract.
that
is
one
of
very
important
questions
that
we
must
understand
here.
perhaps
before
going
into
it,
i'd
like
to
digress
a
minute
to
explain
that
we're
talking
here
about
a
type
of
contract
that
is
both
customary
and
necessary
in
the
gas
business
and
if
they
are
not
sustained,
i
think
will
do
great
harm
to
the
gas
business.
we're
not
talking
about
contracts
with
domestic
consumers.
obviously,
i
couldn't
make
a
contract
to
get
gas
that
might
range
cheaper
than
my
neighbor.
that
could
be
an
unlawful
discrimination.
but
the
natural
gas
act
only
deals
with
these
recent
sales
and
wholesale
for
resale
to
distributing
companies.
there,
we
are
in
a
highly
competitive
business.
the
importance
of
ability
of
a
gas
--
natural
gas
company
to
make
such
contract
is
well
illustrated
by
the
tyler
case,
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs
and
which
has
submitted
to
the
brief
amicus
curiae
in
this
case.
it
had
a
contract,
tyler
distributing
company,
in
the
city
of
tyler,
a
contract
just
as
mobile
had
a
contract
with
the
same
petitioner,
united.
tyler
had
a
franchise
with
the
city
of
tyler.
the
franchise
expired.
well
some
citizens
of
the
city
of
tyler
went
to
the
downfall
and
said,
“we
can
get
you
cheaper
gas
and
the
company
is
getting
from
united.
so
the
tyler
company
went
to
united
and
said,
“we're
going
to
lose
this
business
and
as
you
can
lower
the
rates,”
and
united
said,
“alright
we'll
give
you
rates
--
such
a
rate
much
lower
for
the
duration
of
your
new
franchise,
otherwise,
you
won't
get
the
franchise
15
years.”
the
city
follows
the
tyler
--
wrote
a
letter
to
united
and
said,
“before
we
grant
the
franchise
we
want
you
to
tell
us,
the
governing
body
of
the
city
of
tyler,
that
you're
going
to
abide
by
this
contract
for
its
terms
and
that
if
we
take
over
the
distributing
business,
you'll
sell
to
us
for
the
same
price,
otherwise,
we're
going
to
give
the
gas
to
these
newcomers
have
found
a
well
near
the
city.
mr.
fletcher's
client
agreed
and
wrote
a
letter
saying,
“yes
we'll
not
charge
more
than
this
amount,”
and
they
got
the
franchise.
now
by
the
same
increase,
it
applies
to
us,
they
just
said,
“oh
well,
we're
going
to
increase
it
now.”
and
when
i
ask
in
the
argument
below
whether
they've
been
trying
to
put
one
over
on
a
good
citizens
of
tyler,
let's
say,
they
don't
know,
they
were
actually
in
good
faith
at
that
time,
they
believe
the
contract
was
binding.
but
now
they've
looked
at
the
books
and
think
they
can
get
out
of
it.
now
our
case
presents
another
things
of
these
contracts.
this
question
of
sales
--
for
resale
for
industrial
use.
ideal
cement
company
bought
an
aluminum
plant
in
the
city
of
mobile.
the
question
was,
was
it
going
to
establish
and
turn
it
into
a
cement
plant
in
mobile
for
the
benefit
of
everybody
in
mobile
and
united,
or,
was
it
going
to
remove
the
profiteer
to
its
own
plant
elsewhere
and
the
ideal
cement
company
said
to
mobile
distributing
company,
"if
you
can
guarantee
us
gas
at
12
cents
per
mcf
by
the
cubic
feet
for
10
years,
we
will
develop
a
plant
here.
so
mobile
wrote
to
united
and
united
agreed
in
1946.
that's
the
contract
i'm
talking
about
here.
you
may
sell
--
we
will
sell
gas
to
you
for
resale
to
ideal
for
10
years
at
12
cents
--
you
may
resale
to
them
at
12
cents
and
pay
us
90%
of
that,
which
meant
1.3
we
paid
to
them.
then
we
got
the
contract
and
the
ideal
cement
company
opened
up
its
plant.
now
they're
trying
to
violate
that
contract.
now
the
very
interesting
thing
has
happened
since
this
case
began.
united
has
undertaken
to
induce
my
client
mobile
and
its
other
local
--
and
the
local
industrial
consumers
to
let
them
take
our
contracts
by
assignments
so
they're
not
carrying
out
the
very
same
contract
that
they've
tried
to
abrogate
in
this
proceeding
by
selling
directly
to
the
ideal
cement
company
except
they
pay
us
two
cents
for
transportation.
in
other
words,
they
get
even
less
under
this
arrangement
and
they
did
it
under
a
contract
and
we
get
a
little
more.
we
get
2
cents
instead
of
1.03
cents
and
they
only
get
10
cents
instead
of
12.
i
was
very
much
surprise
when
i
learned
this
and
i
stated
in
my
brief
that
i
couldn't
understand
it.
my
attention
was
called
to
some
cases
that
this
court
had
in
which
the
panhandle
company
was
trying
to
take
over
the
ford
business
in
detroit
by
direct
sales
and
another
business
in
indiana.
and
this
court,
in
those
cases,
pointed
out
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
to
take
off
the
cream
of
the
business
and
get
it
away
from
the
local
distributing
company.
and
get
it
into
their
own
hands
which
would
increase
the
cost
of
gas
to
local
consumers
because
the
distributing
company
is
depending
on
their
industrial
sales
to
make
their
business
functional.
now
at
the
hearing
before
the
federal
power
commission
at
which
this
assignment
contract
that
i
just
spoke
of
was
being
presented.
mr.
fletcher's
client
presented
one
of
its
officials
to
testify.
they
said,
"what
is
the
objective?
united
wishes
to
accomplish
with
regard
to
adjust
fuel
rates
here?"
the
answer
is,
united
--
i'm
reading
at
page
19
of
my
brief.
united
is
found
for
over
a
long
period
time
they
had
again
better
serve
the
public
at
large
by
setting
large
volumes
of
industrial
gas.
this
proceeding
seeks
a
solution
of
the
fundamental
problem
presented
--
presently
encountered
in
the
sale
of
gas
for
industrial
costumers.
such
costumers
are
normally
willing
to
install
unnecessary
facilities
to
burn
gas
and
thereafter
to
purchase
gas
only
when
two
conditions
are
met.
first,
that
the
cost
of
gas
be
no
higher
than
competitive
fuels
and
second,
that
the
cost
of
gas
be
fixed
by
contract
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
because
the
rates
to
distributors
will
be
our
subject
to
regulation
in
change,
they
have
just
upset
our
contracts
before
the
commission.
the
distributors
are
unable
to
safely
put
long-term
rates
for
industrial
gas.
this
condition,
a
major
obstacle
to
industrial
sales
could
be
effectively
eliminated
by
permitting
the
pipe
line
company
to
contract
directly
with
the
industrial
costumer.
in
other
words,
united
has
found
another
way
of
accomplishing
the
results
that
this
court
did
not
allow
panhandle
to
accomplish
by
taking
over
the
direct
sales
of
the
industrial
business
by
showing
that
the
middleman,
the
distributing
company
is
incapable
of
making
a
binding
contract
because
it
can't
make
a
binding
contract
for
the
purchase
of
fuel,
and
of
course,
a
direct
sale
is
not
subject
to
regulation.
if
we
are
reversed
in
this
case,
mr.
fletcher
can
go
to
all
the
industrial
costumers
in
this
area
citing
this
case
and
say,
"you
see,
there's
no
use
you're
dealing
to
the
local
distributing
company.
it
can't
make
a
binding
contract."
they
make
a
--
we
make
a
binding
contract
with
them
to
sell
them
gas
at
a
lower
rate,
we
can
change
it
the
next
day
by
filing
a
higher
rate.
it's
been
so
held
by
the
courts
and
of
course,
they
scraped
the
cream
of
this
business.
that's
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
for
this
peculiar
business,
upsetting
our
contract
by
trying
to
increase
it
and
then
agreeing
to
serve
that
at
even
lower
rate
later
on.
i
think
they're
trying
to
establish
that
proposition.
now,
why
is
the
proposition
wrong?
to
understand
the
question
as
to
what
is
wrong
with
the
proceeding
under
4
(d)
and
4
(e),
one
must
realize
that
in
this
business
regulation,
there
may
be
several
reasonable
rates
for
the
identical
service.
i
think
that
great
many
people
have
been
misled
in
their
thinking
by
the
fact
that
most
of
the
discussions
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
rate,
particularly
in
this
court
and
other
courts,
has
turned
around
rates
fixed
by
the
commission
after
setting
aside
the
rate
fixed
either
by
contract
or
by
filing
by
the
company.
the
commission
fixes
a
rate
that
produces
only
5%
return.
the
company
says
that's
confiscatory.
or,
a
company
fixes
a
rate
producing
the
7%
return.
and
the
commission
says
that's
exorbitant
and
the
court
sustains
the
commission.
and
somewhere
in
between
there,
there
is
an
area
of
reasonableness.
and
when
the
commission
is
fixing
the
rate,
it
picks
out.
it
pinpoints
the
spot
there
where
it
thinks
the
rate
is
reasonable.
and
the
courts
will
not
disturb
the
commission
if
it
is
within
that
reasonable
area
to
produce
a
fair
return
on
its
investment
to
the
company.
the
state
of
california
allows
6%,
the
federal
power
commission,
5.5%
on
electric
business,
and
so
forth.
but
now,
if
you
look
at
the
act,
you'll
remember
that
the
commission
hasn't
any
power
to
fix
rates
until
after
it
has
set
aside
rates
that
have
been
originally
fixed
by
a
company.
the
company
existing
rates
are
filed
under
4
(c)
or
changes
are
filed
under
4
(d)
and
the
commission
may
not
draw
out
such
a
rate
until
a
hearing
under
4
(e)
in
which
it
has
the
same
powers
it
has
under
5
(a)
to
set
it
aside
if
it
is
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential
or
unlawful.
now,
what
is
the
position
of
the
commission
when
it
is
passing
upon
a
rate
that
has
been
fixed
by
a
company
either
by
filing
or
in
a
contract.
it
is
in
the
same
position
in
reviewing
the
commission
here
as
the
court
is
in
reviewing
the
company's
rate
as
the
court
is
in
reviewing
the
commission's
rate.
it
cannot
set
it
aside
unless
it
is
unreasonable,
unduly
discriminatory,
or
unduly
preferential.
now
a
company
isn't
obligated
to
always
put
in
a
rate
that
gives
it
5.5%
if
that
be
the
agreed
reasonable
return
or
6%.
the
company
for
its
own
purposes
may
of
course,
reduce
its
rates
to
meet
competition
provided,
first,
that
the
result
doesn't
create
an
undue
preference
or
an
undue
discrimination,
provided
second,
that
it
isn't,
it
doesn't
so
an
undue
burden
on
other
consumers
that
this
lower
rate
is
absorbed
by
the
company
and
provided
of
course,
that
it
isn't
so
low
as
to
prevent
the
company
from
performing
its
subject
utility
duties.
it
isn't
likely
that
the
company
would
propose
such
a
rate
but
a
contract
might
become
unreasonable
for
that
reason
by
the
action
of
time.
but
otherwise,
the
commission,
as
i
read
the
act,
has
no
duty
to
set
aside
a
rate
because
it's
less
than
fully
compensatory.
and
mr.
wahrenbrock
has
so
admitted
in
his
brief
in
the
sierra
case,
in
the
sierra
case
which
we've
come
to
next.
the
commission
itself
permitted
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
to
file
and
make
effective
rate
to
produce
only
4.75%
on
its
investment
although
it
was
conceded
that
5.5%
was
a
reasonable
rate
of
return
on
its
investment
and
mr.
wahrenbrock
said
to
the
commission,
"that's
perfectly
profited.
the
rate
is
not
discriminatory,
it
doesn't
hurt
anybody,
the
burden
is
absorbed
by
the
stockholders
of
the
company,
it's
not
up
to
the
commission
to
double
guess
a
company
as
to
which
of
several
rates,
all
of
them
reasonable,
it
may
wish
to
select.
so
there
is
no
end,
of
course,
this
court
has
often
held
in
the
railroad
industry
--
railroad
--
carry
the
loss
to
meet
the
competition,
trucks
and
water
cottage
were
also
here.
in
tyler,
texas,
they
had
competition
from
another
well.
in
the
particular
situation
we
had
in
our
case
here,
the
question
was,
whether
the
ideal
cement
company
would
buy
gas
at
all
or
move
elsewhere.
and
they
were
perfectly
justified
in
agreeing
to
end
into
a
contract
at
a
special
low
rate.
now
having
ended
into
a
contract
to
sell
at
a
special
lower
rate,
which
is
less
than
fully
compensatory.
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
do
it
and
it's
the
commission
permitted
them
to
do,
and
it
permitted
the
contract
filed,
the
question
is,
whether
the
company
can
come
in
and
file
under
section
4
(d)
a
new
schedule
of
rates
a
little
higher
but
still
not
exorbitant.
and
thus
break
the
contract.
if
they
can
file
under
4
(d),
that's
exactly
what
they
can
do
because
in
the
hearing
under
4
(d),
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract
rate
isn't
considered
or
reached
at
all.
mr.
wahrenbrock
conceded
and
they
--
they've
all
conceded
in
their
briefs
the
only
issue
in
a
proceeding
under
4
(e)
as
to
a
rate
proposed
under
4
(d)
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
new
rate.
this
court
below
pointed
out,
it
can
be
that
the
new
rate
is
reasonable
and
therefore,
if
it
can
be
filed
in
violation
of
a
contract,
becomes
the
legal
rate.
even
though
the
contract
rate
itself
is
perfectly
reasonable.
and
it
is
for
that
reason,
that
we
have
insisted
throughout
thoughts
on
those
statements,
that
a
contract
is
valid
in
binding
as
between
the
parties
until
and
unless
it
is
set
aside
in
a
proceeding
under
5
(a).
under
5
(a),
congress
has
given,
has
delegated
to
the
commission
its
power
to
abrogate
contracts
from
the
public
interests
suppliers.
they
tell
us
that
under
4
(d),
congress
delegated
the
power
to
the
natural
gas
company,
to
abrogate
its
contract
by
merely
filing
a
new
rate,
provided
the
new
rate
itself
was
reasonable.
now
they
based
their
arguments
in
part
--
primarily
on
the
wording
of
4
(d),
which
i
said
before
seems
to
me
a
very
long
stress
language,
page
101
again
of
mr.
wahrenbrock's
brief.
unless
the
commission
otherwise
orders
no
change
shall
be
made
by
any
natural
gas
company
in
any
rate
or
contract
except
after
30
days
notice
to
the
commission
and
to
the
public.
mr.
wahrenbrock
said
yesterday
"look,
it
says
no
change
shall
be
made
by
any
natural
gas
company."
that
means
that
congress
said
a
natural
gas
company
could
unilaterally
change
its
rate.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
changing
of
the
rate
of
a
contract
is
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
it's
a
repudiation
and
not
a
change.
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
changing
the
contract
means
change
--
no
--
in
fact
it
doesn't
say
they
can
change
it,
they
--
it
doesn't
even
say
they
can
change
the
contract,
they
can't
make
any
--
well
it
does,
it
says
"no
change
shall
be
made
without
notice".
well,
the
change
in
a
contract
rate
means
a
change
agreed
to
by
the
parties
in
the
contract
rate.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no
sir.
congress
said
that
a
contract
can
be
changed
if
it
is
found
against
the
public
interest.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
it
says
"no
rate
or
contract
maybe
changed
without
filing
of
notice".
i
submit
that
when
congress
said
"no
contract
maybe
changed
without
due
notice,"
the
congressman
knew
that
before
a
contract
could
be
change
at
all,
the
parties
must
agree
to
it,
otherwise,
the
contract
is
void
of
ab
initio
for
lack
of
mutuality.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir
and
i
think
congress
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
think
congress
expressly
provided
that
the
contract
could
be
changed
by
the
commission
after
a
finding
that
the
contract
is
against
the
public
interest.
after
all,
sir,
the
power
of
the
government
to
change
contracts
depends
first
on
a
finding
that
the
public
interest
requires
it.
now
as
i
said,
congress
can't
say
we
don't
want
any
contracts
in
this
business.
they
did
say
that
the
railroad
business.
although
it's
interesting
to
point
out
by
the
way,
that
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
contracts
are
--
do
exist
in
our
customary
--
between
shippers
for
true
rates
and
those
contracts
under
section
65
of
the
commerce
act
must
be
filed.
they
used
the
same
language
where
there
are
contracts.
they
used
it
here.
that
shows,
sir,
i
think,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
outlaw
all
contracts.
now
if
congress
didn't
outlaw
all
contracts
in
this
business,
to
whom
did
they
delegate
the
power
to
outlaw?
not
to
the
natural
gas
company
itself
that
decide
that
its
own
contract
is
against
the
public
interest.
they
delegated
it
to
the
commission
specifying
that
the
commission
could
only
do
so
after
a
finding
that
the
contract
injured
the
public
interest.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
what's
that
sir?
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
if
that
can
change
a
contract
rate,
then,
the
contract
can
be
changed
at
will
by
the
company
as
this
contract
was
changed
and
as
the
contract
in
the
sierra
case
was
changed
without
any
finding
that
the
contract
itself
was
ever
against
the
public
interest.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
the
reasonableness
of
a
new
rate
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
not
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
the
point
here
sir,
that
the
new
rate
might
be
reasonable
and
the
contract
rate
might
be
reasonable
too.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
then,
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
any
power
to
throw
out
a
contract
that
is
not
against
the
public
interest.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
think,
sir,
that
section
4
acts
retroactively
and
section
5
prospectively.
under
section
4,
the
company
files
a
rate,
purpose,
of
course,
is
to
have
the
company's
initiate
rates
as
much
as
possible
they
know
most
about.
so
the
company
files
the
rate
and
if
the
company
has
a
legal
right
to
file
a
rate,
in
other
words
if
it
hasn't
contracted
not
to
make
a
change,
it
files
the
rate
and
the
rate
goes
into
effect
either
in
30
days
or
after
five
months
suspension
if
it's
suspendible.
if
it's
not
suspendible
or
isn't
suspended,
it
goes
through
effect
in
30
days.
if
the
commission
wants
to
investigate
it,
it
requires
the
company,
if
it
suspends
the
rate,
requires
the
company
to
keep
books
so
that
a
refund
can
be
made
in
case
later
the
rate
is
found
to
have
been
exorbitant.
after
two
or
three
years,
the
commission
finally
makes
a
decision,
hearing,
that
the
new
rate
was
reasonable,
why
then
the
company
keeps
what
it's
been
getting.
if
it
finds
it
unreasonable,
it
fixes
a
new
rate
then
the
company
refunds.it's
all
retroactive.
under
section
5,
the
commission
may
not
--
the
commission,
of
course,
has
no
power
to
do
anything
under
4
until
it's
found
the
rate
unreasonable.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
it
can,
yes,
sir.
if
a
file
--
if
a
rate
is
filed
under
section
4
(d),
the
commission
may
let
it
go
into
effect
in
30
days
and
it's
the
rate.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh,
yes
sir.
for
instance,
any
rate,
suppose
a
rate
goes
into
effect
of
30
days,
the
commission
thought
it
was
all
right.
he
gets
a
violent
letter
from
somebody
who
says
"hey,
you've
got
to
look
into
that
rate,
it's
outrageous,
it
does
this
and
that".
well
it's
too
late
to
suspend
that,
so
they
proceed
under
5
(a).
usually,
they
get
those
letters
within
the
30
days
and
then
they
suspend
it
and
hold
a
hearing
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates
before
it
becomes
finally
effective.
after
it's
become
finally
effective,
suppose
they've
gone
through
a
long
hearing,
for
two
or
three
years
and
they
say
this
rate
is
perfectly
all
right,
and
put
into
effect,
the
very
next
day
somebody
can
come
in,
the
commission
say,
"here
are
some
circumstances
that
make
us
think
that
rate
is
too
high".
mr.
william
c.
chanler
and
begin
under
5
(a),
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
are
what?
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
the
only
place
where
they
become
significantly
different
is
in
the
situation
where
you
have
a
contract.
the
--
if
a
company
can
enter
into
a
contract
to
serve
at
a
fixed
rate
for
a
period
of
years,
then,
i
maintain
that
it
could
not
be
permitted
to
change
that
rate
by
merely
filing
unilaterally
an
increase
and
saying
the
increase
rate
is
valid.
therefore,
in
that
situation,
the
contract
remains
binding
as
between
the
two
parties
until
the
commission
acts
under
section
5
(a).
now
if
the
--
if
the
contract
hurts
anybody,
somebody
comes
up
and
say
"here,
these
fellows
made
a
contract.
they're
discriminated
against
me.
i'm
next
door."
or
the
contract
rate
is
too
high.
or
the
company
can't
perform
its
services
anymore
and
says
it's
got
so
many
low
rate
contracts,
it
isn't
making
any
money.
by
then,
the
commission
will
hold
a
hearing
and
find
out
whether
that's
a
fact,
and
if
so,
the
commission
exercising
the
power
of
the
government
to
set
aside
private
rights,
sets
aside
the
contract
on
the
grounds
that
the
public
interest
is
injured
by
that
contract
and
orders
a
new
rate.
until
that
happens,
we
maintain
--
the
contract
is
valid
and
possible
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well,
no,
sir,
because
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
it's
the
reasonableness
of
the
proposed
increase
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
--
no,
not
of
the
increase
but
of
the
new
rate
sir
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
--
it's
a
little
very
close.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
it's
the
new
rate
not
the
fact
that
they're
increasing
it.
if
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
it
isn't
because
the
whole
matter
has
been
wiped
out
by
this
conversion
tariff
--
but
it
should
be,
normally.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
you
know,
they've
taken
over
our
contract.
now,
so
i
can't
say
that
there's
anything
pending
before
the
commission.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
the
question
here
is
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no
sir.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
--
this
contract
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well,
it
raises
--
the
question
is
exactly
how
it
arises
sir.
it
arises
this
way.
if
i
am
right
when
i
say
that
when
a
company
files
an
increase
under
section
4,
it
is
violating
its
contract.
then
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
if
you
would
assume
that,
then
we
maintain
that
in
order
to
prevent
contracts
and
being
unilaterally
abrogated,
the
commission,
when
increase
is
filed
with
it
and
the
commission
is
told
that
that
violates
a
contract,
the
commission
must
reject
the
filing
of
having
been
unlawfully
made.
otherwise,
if
they
go
ahead
and
--
leave
it
in
their
files
as
a
file
of
increase,
the
commission
has
no
alternative
but
to
hold
a
hearing
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
new
rate
and
if
that
is
also
within
this
wide
area
of
reasonableness
as
well
as
the
contract
rate
to
permit
the
contract
to
be
abrogated
although
the
contract
is
still
perfectly
reasonable.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
the
question
is
whether
pending
that
determination
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
the
filed
rate
may
remain
on
the
books
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
it's
not
--
nothing
to
do
with
suspension,
it's
more
than
that.
we
say
the
filing
must
be
rejected,
it's
not
a
question
of
suspending
because
the
suspension
would
only
be
for
five
months
anyhow.
we
say
that
they
had
no
right
to
file
an
increase
of
an
existing
valid
contract.
they
had
to
wait
until
the
commission
had
found
that
the
contract
was
against
he
public
interest,
then,
the
commission
either
sets
a
new
rate
or
what
they
usually
do,
they
say
to
the
company
"that
contract
is
no
good,
go
make
another
one
and
bring
it
here
and
we'll
look
at
it."
mr.
william
c.
chanler
that's
what
he
could
do.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no,
sir.
if
--
because
they
nearly
always
do
have
contract.
it's
intended
to
apply
when
there's
a
contract.
it
said
the
congress
--
the
congressman
who
proposed
the
amendment
said
that
we're
doing
this
because
they
usually
are
involved
in
contracts.
but
i
say,
that
when
the
congressman
spoke
of
changing
rates
in
the
contract,
he
assumed
that
the
policies
have
agreed
to
the
change.
i
think
the
congressman
knows
the
word
contract
means
an
agreement
binding
on
both
parties.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well,
if
--
if
it's
been
found
wanting
under
5,
there
was
no
contract
and
then
they
would
file
again
under
4.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
section
4,
well,
i
don't
know,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
different
the
other
day,
after
the
commission
sets
a
contract
aside
and
directs
the
company
to
fix
a
new
rate,
i
would
have
thought
the
company
was
then
acting
under
section
4.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
recent
panhandle
case,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
were
acting
still
under
5
because
they
were
acting
under
the
direction
of
the
company
but
i
don't
know
that
that
--
i
think
that
only
confuses
us
here.
i
don't
think
it
helps
the
argument.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir.
as
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
ask
them
to
reject
the
filing
because
it
was
in
violation
of
our
contract
and
the
company
had
no
right
to
file
an
increase
in
violation
of
our
contract
in
the
absence
of
any
finding
that
the
contract
was
against
the
public
interest.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes
sir.
if
they
eliminate
--
if
they
grant
our
petition,
the
filing
is
rejected
and
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
but
we're
waiting
for
that.
if
you
affirm
below,
the
commission
will
be
ordered
to
reject
the
filing
as
of
the
date
when
it
was
made,
we
will
recover
the
amounts
that
we
have
paid
in
excess
of
our
contracts
since
it
became
effective
30
days
after
the
filing.
and
the
--
except
that
it
prevents
them
to
have
--
since
happened,
the
commission
could
and
in
the
other
case,
undoubtedly,
will
proceed
in
a
5
(a)
proceeding
to
examine
our
contract
and
see
whether
or
not
it's
against
the
public
interest
which
is
what
we
asked
them
to
do
in
the
first
place.
in
our
petition
we
pointed
out
to
the
commission,
that
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
our
contract,
they
should
hold
the
hearing
under
5
(a),
and
determine
the
validity
of
the
contract,
but
they
couldn't
let
the
company
throw
out
our
contract
before
there'd
been
any
such
hearing.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i'm
afraid
our
--
now
this
record
is
all
right
i
guess.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
what's
that?
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes
although
we've
misstated
something
on
the
front
page,
i
think,
i
forget
what
it
was.
misdescribed
somebody
i
think.
page
17,
wherefore
your
petitioners
respectively
phrase
that
the
commission
forthwith
enter
an
order
amending
and
modifying
its
order
of
july
10,
1953
so
as
to
provide
that
the
filing
of
--
was
she
defecting
us?
insofar
as
they
apply
to
the
service
of
mobile
to
mobile
for
resale
of
ideal
be
rejected.
and
further
phrase
that
in
the
event
of
foregoing
relief
be
denied.
the
commission
entered
an
order
amending
its
order
shows
to
provide
for
section
5
proceeding
as
to
the
validity
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir.
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
that's
right,
yes
sir.
that's
--
that's
the
whole
point.
now,
i
think
whether
a
lot
more
to
this
case,
but
i
don't
think
i'll
go
into
it
now
because
i
would
probably
end
up
confusing
you.
it
is
a
difficult
question.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
mr.
wahrenbrock
in
his
speech
states
that
the
commission
has
uniformly
construed
the
statute
as
permitting
contract
rates
to
be
abrogated
by
a
mere
filing.
in
my
brief,
i
challenged
that
statement
and
stated
that
i
believe
this
is
the
first
time
it
has
ever
been
authorized
by
the
commission.
mr.
wahrenbrock,
in
his
brief,
cites
in
support
of
his
statement
long
series
of
cases
revolving
around
the
panhandle
company
which
had
been
frequently
in
these
court.
panhandle
over
sold
its
gas.
it
sold
more
gas
than
it
could
deliver
on
the
contract.
it
contracted
to
deliver
more.
and
the
contracts
had
to
be
revised.
the
commission
held
hearings
under
section
5.
mr.
wahrenbrock
says
they
were
under
section
4.
the
commission
held
hearings
under
section
5
as
i
shall
demonstrate
conclusively
in
a
moment
and
ordered
them
to
limit
their
deliveries
and
to
change
their
rates.
now
when
they
ordered
them
to
change
their
rates
in
some
cases,
the
new
rates
were
filed
i
think
under
section
4.
we
did
think
so
until
today.
and
so
he
says,
these
were
section
4
proceedings,
but
the
new
rates
were
not
filed
until
after
the
commission
had
found
the
contracts
to
be
against
the
public
interest.
now
the
most
recent
case
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
refer
in
my
brief,
sir,
to
report
to
the
commission
to
decide
the
cases.
i
now
wish
to
read
from
a
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
from
the
sixth
circuit
handed
down
on
october
8
last
--
october
6
last
on
rehearing,
michigan
consolidated
versus
panhandle.
panhandle
and
michigan
ended
into
a
contract
in
1938
or
1939,
i
think,
which
involved
both
rates
and
terms
of
service.
in
1942,
the
commission
held
a
5
(a)
proceeding,
held
the
contract
against
the
public
interest
ordered
a
new
schedule
of
file.
the
new
schedule,
both
ceo
held
the
writ
to
be
against
the
public
interest
and
ordered
a
new
schedule
of
file.
panhandle
filed
a
new
schedule
that
both
changed
the
rate
and
changed
the
terms
and
conditions
of
service.
this,
in
this
case,
michigan
consolidated
said
"you
are
violating
the
terms
and
conditions
of
service"
and
they
were
not
properly
changed
by
you.
why
not?
because
there
was
no
finding
that
the
--
that
under
5
(a),
that
the
existing
terms
and
conditions
of
service
were
bad,
the
only
finding
was
that
the
rate
was
wrong.
consolidated
both,
i
think
the
commission
and
panhandle
said,
"oh,
this
was
a
filing
under
section
4,"
and
adapting
the
same
view
they
do
here.
we
don't
need
any
finding
and
as
far
--
and
a
filing
under
section
4,
i'll
read
just
one
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
said
"no,
this
isn't
a
new
filing
under
section
4.
you
were
directed
by
the
commission
after
us
finding
that
the
contract
rate
was
unlawful
under
section
5
to
file
a
new
schedule.
you
can't
change
anything
but
the
rates.
you
can't
change
the
terms
and
conditions
until
there's
been
a
finding
that
they
are
unreasonable.
on
rehearing
they
said,
"we
don't
pass
on
whether
if
it
were
a
section
4
proceeding,
you
could
file
without
a
finding."
mobile
and
the
tyler
case
don't
apply
here.
all
we
say
is,
that
this
is
a
section
5
proceeding.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
think
in
my
brief,
i
will
quote
--
i
quote
statements
by
the
commission
either
under
section
4
or
5
this
can't
be
done.
the
commission

commission
steps
out
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
the
commission
staff
counsel
is
here
and
he
doesn't
agree
with
me.
he
says
there's
no
difference
between
the
two
sections
and
he's
advised
the
commission
has
drawn
their
orders,
that
when
you
look
at
what
actually
happened,
the
court
say,
"no,
this
is
a
section
5
proceeding,"
regardless
of
what
they
denominated.
well
actually
all
these
panhandle
cases
were
denominated
originally
section
5.
and
then
when
they
found
the
contract
unreasonable
and
told
the
company
to
fix
new
rates,
it
was
assumed
and
i
don't
quite
quarrel
with
it,
that
that
was
under
4,
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that's
under
5
(2),
i
don't
think
it
matters
very
much.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
let's
see.
i
have
it
here
and
i
wish
i
find
it
sooner.
i
would
