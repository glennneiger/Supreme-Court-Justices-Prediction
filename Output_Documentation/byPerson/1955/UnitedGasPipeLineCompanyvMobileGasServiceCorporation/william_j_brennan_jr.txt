has
the
commission
ever
passed
on
the
reasonableness
of
this
40.5
cent
rate
of
mobile
yet?
justice

then
it
started
in
1952?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
as
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
i
understand
it,
it's
your
position
and
that
is
the
commission
that
there's
no
way
at
all,
even
if
it's
held
to
be
an
unreasonable
rate,
40.5
cent
for
mobile
to
get
anything
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

at
least
the
question
presented
to
us
for
which
we
took
certiorari
is
apparently
limited
to
that.
