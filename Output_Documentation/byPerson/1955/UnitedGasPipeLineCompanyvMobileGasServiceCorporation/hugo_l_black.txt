justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
question
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
the
customer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mobile
had
a
contract
with
united
by
gas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
much
per,
whatever
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
10.7
and
united
came
in
and
--
how
long
did
the
contract
been
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
united
then
came
into
the
commission
and
said,
“we
want
to
raise
the
rates.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
--
they'd
be
asked
to
raise
it
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
14.5
and
they
--
and
the
commission
has
permitted
that
rate
to
take
place
without
a
hearing?
is
that
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
did
it
permit
it
to
go
into
effect
without
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
get
just
what
the
issue
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
commission
--
did
the
commission
permit
the
increase
rate
to
go
in
effect
over
the
mobile's
objection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
go
into
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
commission
let
it
go
in
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
14.5
cents?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
issue
--
is
the
issue
as
stated
right
here
that
the
mobile
says,
"that's
wrong,”
because
the
commission
should
have
interfere
without
a
prior
contract,
but
that
helped
holding
hearing
determined
reasonableness
before
it
permitted
the
change
to
be
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
solely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
would
you
refer
us
to
that
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
state
please
or
refer
me
to
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
you
say
bars
the
commission
from
doing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
only
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you
very
much.
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
101
of
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
102?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
proviso
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you
very
much.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
this
proviso
that
i
just
read,
it
refers
to
schedule
and
tariffs.
does
it
say
anything
about
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whether
you
suspended
it
or
not,
the
effect
of
this
is
to
increase
the
price
to
mobile
above
the
agreement
that
it
made
by
the
gas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
until
that
time,
it's
got
to
pay
more
than
it
needs
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
the
only
authority
you
have,
your
--
(inaudible)
has
been
on
(e)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
said
nothing
about
contracts.
how
do
you
get
contract
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
(c)
and
(d)
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you're
going
to
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
what
you're
going
to
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
stated
the
commission
may
allow
changes
in
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
provision
that
you
just
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
rate
has
been
in
effect
for
a
number
of
years
as
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
under
the
commission's
order
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
now
you
--
you
say
that
you
got
to
keep
them
always
subject
to
the
commission's
order,
but
you
say
that
the
commission
has
no
power
at
all
to
prevent
a
company
raising
it
above
what's
been
held
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
by
contract
and
by
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
it
in
effect?
how
was
the
10.5
cent
rate
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
it
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
--
does
that
mean
if
the
commission
accepted
it,
it's
just
and
reasonable
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
--
has
it
yet
acted
on
this
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
--
that
would
be
much
hardship
for
united,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
--
your
claim
of
--
in
fact,
there
is,
isn't
it,
that
that
would
not
be
a
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
not
be
a
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
you
are?
if
mobile
and
united
had
agreed
to
change
their
contract
validly
and
make
a
real
change
instead
of
one
trying
to
repudiate
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
that
--
that
tariff
could
have
been
filed
and
the
proviso
would
have
apply.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
can't
apply
it
as
a
chain
when
it's
a
mere
repudiation
of
a
valid
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
your
argument,
is
this
contract
have
any
validity
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
purpose
of
law.
in
your
judgement,
is
this
contract
have
any
--
this
kind
of
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
any
validity
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
mobile
should
decide
it
didn't
want
to
continue
to
divide
its
10
cents.
and
it's
the
one
that
stopped.
could
you
sue
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
divided
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
divided
on
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
but
suppose
it
decide
it
and
didn't
want
to
buy
it
at
all.
they
said,
“we
don't
want
it
anymore.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
obligation
under
the
contracts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
binding
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
--
but
your
view
is,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
binding
on
it,
but
you
can
change
it
any
moment
you
please,
simply
by
filing
a
statement
if
we
raise
the
rate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
whatever
it
is,
you
can
do
it
at
will,
can
you
not,
you
can
change
the
rate
at
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
under
the
proviso
--
under
the
proviso
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
only
one
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
you
have
a
right
to
make
contracts
of
industrial
when
does
few
rate,
but
you
can
enforce
against
them,
but
that
you
can
file
a
rate,
new
rate
with
the
commission
above
the
contract
rate
at
any
moment
you
see
fit
and
the
commission
is
without
power
under
the
proviso
to
do
anything
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
enter
a
hearing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
until
that's
done,
you
get
the
increased
rate,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you'll
get
it
--
you'll
get
it
despite
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it's
a
very
valid,
easily
understood
provision
of
the
law,
which
will
argue
the
contract
that
way.
but
under
your
statement,
the
contract
binding
on
you
but
not
binding
on
them,
but
binding
on
them
but
not
binding
on
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
having
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
having
abrogated
it,
is
there
any
part
of
the
obligation
on
mobile
under
that
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
having
abrogated,
as
you
say,
validate
by
--
and
filing
an
increase
rate,
is
there
any
further
obligation
on
mobile
under
it's
contract
with
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
having
raised
the
rate
above
that,
which
is
provided
in
the
contract
with
mobile,
is
there
any
further
obligation
on
mobile
to
comply
with
that
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
changed
and
modified
by
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
repudiated
by
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
there's
a
new
contract.
to
change
in
a
contract
was
the
same
as
a
new
one.
i
would
always
thought
that
a
contract
is
a
mutual
obligation
between
two
or
more
(inaudible)
upon
a
valuable
consideration
for
local
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
to
this
change.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
difficulty
--
i
have
no
difficulty
insofar
as
you
rely
on
the
statute,
if
the
statute
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
change
of
a
contract.
that's
a
statutory
change
you
can
get
on.
