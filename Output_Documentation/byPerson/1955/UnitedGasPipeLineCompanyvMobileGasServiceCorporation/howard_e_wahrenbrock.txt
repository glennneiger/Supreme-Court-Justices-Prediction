mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
this
case
brings
before
the
court
a
controversy
as
to
the
effect
of
an
increase
in
a
utilities
filed
rate
on
its
contract
to
sell
at
a
previous
lower
rate.
united
gas
pipe
line
company,
which
is
the
petitioner
in
number
17,
is
an
interstate
natural
gas
company
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
used
in
the
natural
gas
act,
meaning
a
company
that
is
generally
subject
to
regulation
under
that
act.
and
that
company
has
on
file
with
the
federal
power
commission
under
the
regulations
of
that
commission
relating
to
the
filing
of
rates
in
accordance
with
the
filed
rate
procedure
of
the
natural
gas
act,
its
rates
for
the
sales
which
are
here
involved.
the
mobile
gas
service
corporation,
which
is
the
respondent
in
both
of
these
cases
is
a
local
distributor
of
gas
in
mobile,
alabama,
of
gas
which
it
purchases
from
the
united
gas
pipe
line
company.
the
specific
question
here
presented
is
whether
under
the
rate
filing
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
federal
power
commission
properly
accepted
a
utilities
filing
of
an
increase
in
its
filed
rate,
pending
a
hearing
on
the
increased
rate
where
the
utility
had
a
contract
to
sell
at
a
previous
rate
and
the
customer
objected
to
the
increase.
now,
the
previous
filings
which
are
here
involved
began
with
the
filing
of
the
basic
contract
which
had
been
entered
into
in
1936
and
which
was
to
continue
until
1950.
that
contract
was
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission
in
1938,
following
the
enactment
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
promulgation
of
the
commission's
rules
requiring
the
filing
of
rate
schedules
and
designated
as
that
company's
rate
schedule
number
20.
it
was
filed
in
a
sort
of
hybrid
way
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
commission,
whereby
the
contract
serves
two
purposes.
the
definition
in
the
contract
of
the
rate
and
the
service
constitute
the
rate,
the
schedule
of
the
rate.
the
contract
is
also
filed
as
a
contract
relating
to
that
rate.
in
1941,
an
amendment
was
filed
designated
as
supplement
number
7
to
that
rate
schedule
number
20,
which
change
the
contract
term
by
extending
it
until
1962
and
provided
for
a
price
of
80%
to
90%
of
the
buyer's
owned
price
for
industrial
gas
with
a
minimum
of
16
cents
per
mcf
to
united
gas
pipe
line
company.
in
1946,
a
further
amendment
was
filed
which
altered
the
80%
to
90%
ratios
for
a
particular
industrial
resale
to
a
--
to
the
ideal
cement
company
for
a
period
of
10
years
and
waived
the
16
cent
minimum.
the
resale
price
to
the
ideal
cement
company
which
mobile
would
charge
would
be
12
cents
per
mcf
and
united
would
take
its
80%
to
90%
of
that.
now,
in
1952,
pursuant
to
new
regulations
of
the
federal
power
commission,
united
filed
what
were
called
conversion
terms,
converting
all
of
its
prior
filings
into
a
new
compact
and
general
tariff
with
separate
sheets
for
separate
types
of
services.
the
effect
of
that
tariff
was
to
substitute
a
rate
of
10.7
cents
per
mcf
for
the
old
revenue
sharing
rate
of
80
to
90,
a
flat-cent
rate.
and
to
redefine
the
service,
the
practices
with
respect
to
measurement
and
billing
and
the
provisions
with
respect
to
the
btu
content
of
the
gas
to
eliminate
the
tax
adjustment
clause
so
that
the
rate
would
be
definite,
not
only
in
cents,
but
would
not
be
subject
to
adjustment
because
of
tax
changes.
to
prescribe
a
new
form
of
service
agreement
within
individual
customers,
which
would
be
the
only
form
of
contract
thereafter
to
be
entered
into
with
any
individual
customer.
and
in
lieu
of
a
presently
effective
service
contract
to
carry
forward,
stipulated
provisions
of
the
old
contract
which
are
designated
in
that
filing
and
which
were
not
superseded
by
the
new
rate
and
service
provisions
of
the
new
tariff.
on
august
the
1st
of
1952,
the
federal
power
commission
allowed
that
conversion
tariff
to
take
effect
in
part.
it
set
a
hearing
on
the
other
part
and
suspended
the
other
part,
the
other
part
consisting
of
united's
rates
governing
its
services
and
sales
to
other
pipelines.
those
were
increased
at
the
same
time
and
the
commission
suspended
those
increases
and
set
a
hearing
on
them,
but
on
the
--
on
the
changes
which
affected
this
rate
to
mobile
which
were
changes
in
form
leaving
a
10.7
cent
rate
in
effect
which
was
the
equivalent
of
what
the
average
payment
under
the
old
rate
had
been
and
therefore
involved
no
substantial
change
as
of
that
date.
that
was
allowed
to
go
into
effect.
now,
the
controverted
filing
which
is
involved
here
occurred
on
june
the
24th,
1953
when
united
filed
two
new
sheets
increasing
this
10.7
cent
per
mcf
rate
to
14.5
cents.
the
same
time
it
requested
waiver
of
the
30-day
notice
requirement
of
the
statute
and
asked
that
the
new
increase
rate
go
into
effect
in
20
days
on
july
the
15th.
there's
no
issue
here
about
that
waiver.
i
might
just
explain
that
the
statute
does
permit
the
commission
for
good
cause
shown
to
permit
a
rate
to
go
into
effect
without
the
30-day
notice.
and
the
commission
in
that
instance
refused
to
do
that
and
by
an
order
that
was
issued
on
july
the
10th
ordered
that
the
rate
should
not
go
into
effect
in
advance
of
30
days,
leaving
it
to
go
into
effect
at
the
end
of
the
30
days
provided
by
the
statute.
it
set
a
hearing
on
all
the
new
rates
which
were
provided
for,
the
increase
rates
which
were
provided
for.
it
consolidated
that
hearing
with
hearings
which
were
already
pending
on
united's
rates,
on
all
of
united's
rates
and
suspended
all
of
the
increase
except
the
one
increase
here
involved
in
the
amount
charged
for
gas
resold
by
mobile
to
the
ideal
cement
company.
that
being
a
sale
of
gas
for
resale
for
industrial
use
fell
within
the
provisions
of
the
power
act
which
are
printed
on
page
102
of
our
brief,
the
provision
that
the
commission
shall
not
have
authority
to
suspend
the
rate
charge
classification
or
service
with
the
sale
of
natural
gas
for
resale
for
industrial
use
only.
so,
that
rate
could
not
be
suspended.
it
went
into
effect
then
on
july
the
25th,
but
the
commission
did
by
this
order
set
a
hearing
on
that
together
with
all
other
rates
and
consolidated
that
hearing
with
the
pending,
the
proceeding
that
was
then
pending
before
it.
i
may
say
incidentally
that
this
prohibition
on
suspending
industrial
rates
is
one
which
the
commission
has
year
after
year
recommended
to
congress
be
repealed.
four
weeks
later,
mobile
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
know
of
none.
it's
been
--
this
has
been
stated
in
our
annual
reports
year
after
year.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
part
of
section
4
(e),
yes,
on
page
102
of
our
brief.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
is
somewhat
obscure,
but
the
explanation
--
that
seems
as
good
as
an
explanation
as
any
if
your
honor
please.
the
mobile's
petition
filed
four
weeks
later
asked
that
the
commission
modify
the
order
which
had
entered
on
july
10th
in
these
respects.
it
asked
that
it
reject
the
filing
of
the
increase
for
this
industrial
gas
to
mobile,
reject
the
filing
or
alternatively
that
it
set
a
separate
hearing
on
the
rate
to
mobile
and
that
it
provide
for
refund
to
mobile
of
any
excess
ultimately
determined
over
what
the
commission
should
ultimately
determine
to
be
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
this
gas.
the
commission
on
december
the
7th
entered
the
order
which
is
here
under
review,
dismissing
mobile's
petition.
it
refused
to
reject
united's
proffered
rate
increase,
pointing
out
that
although
there
was
a
previous
contract
for
the
earlier
rate,
the
rate
schedule
of
filing
conforms
to
the
act
and
to
the
rules.
it
said
that
it
was
the
only
way
in
which
a
natural
gas
company
could
increase
its
rates
by
filing
its
--
its
increase
with
the
commission.
the
commission
refused
to
separate
the
proceedings
from
the
other
hearing
saying
that
the
issues
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
this
rate
to
mobile
involved
very
many
common
issues
with
all
of
the
other
rates
of
the
united
gas
pipe
line
and
it
declined
to
order
a
refund
saying
that
the
commission's
authority
with
respect
to
refunds
was
limited
to
those
cases
in
which
it
had
power
to
suspend.
there
is
no
issue
presented
here
on
the
refund
in
view
of
the
decision
taken
by
the
court
below,
but
i
might
just
say
that
the
commission's
basis
for
that
is
found
in
the
provision
of
section
4
(e)
on
--
printed
in
our
brief
at
page
102
where
the
act
says,
“if
the
proceeding
has
not
been
concluded
at
the
expiration
of
the
suspension
period,
on
the
motion
of
the
natural
gas
company,
the
proposed
change
shall
go
into
effect,”
and
then
the
next
sentence,
“where
increased
rates
or
charges
are
thus
made
effective,
the
commission
may
by
order
require
the
natural
gas
company
to
furnish
a
bond
to
refund
with
interest,
the
portion
of
such
increase
rates
or
charges
by
its
decision
filed
and
not
justified.”
based
on
that
as
it
seems,
the
clear
reading
of
the
statute,
the
commission
declined
to
refund.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
the
question
is
whether
united
by
filing
this
increase
in
its
rates,
whether
the
commission
had
to
accept
that
filing,
properly
accepted
that
filing
where
there
was
an
outstanding
contract
by
united
to
sell
at
the
higher
rate
and
where
the
customer
objected
to
as
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
mobile.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
at
10.7
cents.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
contract
had
been
in
effect
since
1936
and
had
it
1930
--
1962
to
run.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
filed
an
increase
in
its
rate
schedule.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
to
14.5.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commission
said
that
it
--
that
the
rate
would
go
into
effect
but
it
set
it
for
a
hearing.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
yes.
the
commission
said
that
it
had
(voice
overlap)
the
commission
had
no
power
to
do
anything
but
let
it
go
into
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
question
here
is
whether
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commission
refused
to
reject
the
filing
of
the
increase.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
every
rate,
in
the
--
and
it
has
such
power
in
every
case,
except
where
this
prohibition
applies
where
it
may
not
suspend
and
that
is
where
the
gas
is
resold
for
industrial
use.
in
every
other
case,
the
commission
may
suspend
exactly
as
the
--
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
and
it
did
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
say
it
is
and
that
is
the
basis
of
our
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
we
say
that
it
is
and
that's
the
conflict
here.
that's
the
question
here.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
provision
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
that
--
that
is
the
--
the
--
i'm
now
stating
the
commission
--
the
commission's
position
after
the
commission
dismissed
this
petition
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
page
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it's
section
4
(e)
printed
on
page
102.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
102.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
provided
that
the
commission
shall
not
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commission
set
a
hearing
and
that
hearing
--
at
that
hearing,
the
reasonableness
of
this
rate
would
be
examined
into.
now,
that
--
that
hearing
was
set
and
that
--
that
question
was
preserved,
but
the
commission
simply
did
not
suspend
the
rate
from
taking
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
we
have
here
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
properly
allowed
united
to
file
this
increase,
the
increase
unless
the
commission
should
subsequently
find
it
unreasonable
and
hold
it
unlawful
in
which
case
there
would
be
no
increase.
but
in
the
mean
time,
allow
it
to
take
effect
or
what
--
the
reasonableness,
the
--
the
lawfulness
of
the
commission's
rejecting
that
--
that
finding.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
if
the
commission
finds
subsequently
that
the
increase
is
unlawful,
then
it
was
unlawful
from
the
time
it
came
in.
if
on
a
--
on
a
contrary
the
commission
initiated
its
own
proceeding,
it
could
only
act
prospectively
from
the
end
of
the
proceeding
instead
from
the
beginning.
so,
there
is
a
period
of
time
here
during
which
it
was
not
suspended
that
there
maybe
an
unrecoverable
amount.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
the
commission
said
that
it
has
no
--
no
power
to
require
a
refund
for
that
difference
in
the
meantime
because
the
refund
power
is
only
where
there
is
a
rate
that
is
capable
of
suspension.
we
have
this
prohibition
here.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
is
the
language
which
i
referred
to
that
begins
following
at
the
bottom
of
page
102
and
the
top
of
103.
“if
the
proceeding
has
not
been
concluded
and
an
order
made
at
the
expiration
suspension
period,
the
proposed
charge
shall
go
into
effect
where
increase
rates
are
charged,”
thus
made
effect
if
the
commission
may
require
the
refunding
operations,
but
it's
only
in
those
cases
where
there
has
been
a
suspension.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
the
proviso
shall
not
have
authority
to
suspend
the
rate
or
charge
for
the
resale
for
industrial
use
only.
the
--
the
proviso
does
not
deal
with
--
with
contracts
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
what
was
here
filed
was
a
rate
schedule
and
the
question
was
whether
the
commission
--
your
question
is
whether
the
commission
should
have
suspended
that.
there
was
no
question
of
suspending
a
contract.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
subject
to
the
commission's
ultimate
determination
of
its
lawfulness.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
this
is
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
(e),
the
filing
--
you're
talking
about
the
suspension
provision
which
deals
only
with
what
is
filed
which
is
a
new
rate
schedule,
all
the
rest
of
(c)
and
(d)
deal
equally
in
parallel
terms
with
contracts
and
with
rates.
there
is
no
distinction
between
them.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
we
--
we've
got
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
now
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
a
hearing.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no
and
that's
what
the
commission
did
here.
instead
for
hearing
within
10
days.
it
started
its
hearing
right
away
on
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
only
on
these
industrial
rates,
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
no,
that's
what
the
statute
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
alright.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
yes.
that's
--
there's
an
awful
lot
of
law
on
that,
if
your
honor
please.
but
our
--
the
mobile
then
on
--
on
a
denial
of
its
petition,
petition
for
rehearing,
rehearing
was
denied.
it
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
--
second
circuit
for
review.
the
third
circuit
reversed
with
judge
hastie
dissented
and
united
and
the
federal
power
commission
petitioned
for
certiorari
here.
now,
the
problem
is
solely
on
the
statutory
construction
as
mobile
agreed
in
--
in
the
court
below.
that
question
is,
“did
congress
exempt
filed
rates
from
change
by
a
new
filing
in
cases
where
the
customer
has
a
contract
for
the
old
rate
and
objects?”
we
believe
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
statutory
terms
will
show
that
the
commission
read
them
correctly
and
i
might
start
out
by
saying
that
sections
4
and
5
(a)
are
the
sections
that
are
here
involved
and
i'll
just
point
out
that
section
5
(a)
is
the
usual
provision
that
appears
on
page
103
of
our
brief
and
104.5
(a)
is
the
usual
provision
that
the
commission
may
investigate
rates
if
it
finds
them
unlawful
may
prescribe
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
be
thereafter
observed
and
enforced.
that's
the
commission
fixing.
now,
4
is
--
section
4
is
the
rate
we
have
here
involved,
the
two
subsections
which
precedes
(c)
that
appears
on
page
101
are
the
sections
which
established
the
standards,
statutory
standard,
(a)
says,
“rates
must
be
just
and
reasonable.
(b)
says
they
must
be
not
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential.”
those
are
the
two
sections
establishing
the
statutory
standard.
then,
we
come
to
(c)
and
(c)
says
that,
“every
natural
gas
company
must
file
its
--
all
of
its
rates
which
are
subject
to
a
regulation
of
the
commission
with
the
commission
and
file
all
contracts
affecting
or
relating
to
such
rates.”
now,
the
effect
of
that
filed
rate
procedure
is
under
the
--
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
federal
power
act
as
well.
it's
just
what
it
is
under
the
commerce
act.
as
this
court
said
in
the
montana-dakota
case,
petitioner
can
claim
no
rate
as
a
legal
right
that
is
other
than
the
filed
rate,
whether
it's
fixed
or
merely
accepted
by
the
commission
and
not
even
a
court
can
authorize
the
commerce
and
the
commodity
on
other
terms
than
those
that
are
filed.
section
(d)
then
is
the
one
which
provides
for
the
changing
of
rates
which
are
on
file
with
the
commission.it
starts
out,
“unless
the
commission
otherwise
orders,
no
change
shall
be
made
by
any
natural
gas
company
in
any
such
rate,
charge,
classification
or
service
or
in
any
rule,
regulation
or
contract
relating
thereto.”
and
i'd
like
to
interrupt
myself
to
say
that
the
statute
speaks
of
a
change
made
by
the
natural
gas
company,
not
by
the
parties
to
the
contract
or
not
by
the
commission
made
by
the
natural
gas
company
and
it
speaks
equally
of
a
change
in
a
rate
and
a
change
in
the
contract.
and
then,
i
might
say
that
mobile
objects.
“how
can
these
words
of
prohibition,
no
change
shall
be
made.”
they
tortured
into
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
to
change
a
contract,
but
mobile's
objection
ignores
the
exception
which
follows,
for
the
statute
goes
on
to
say,
“no
change
shall
be
made
except
after
30
days
notice
to
the
commission
and
the
public.
such
notice
shall
be
given
by
filing
with
the
commission
and
keeping
open
for
public
inspection
new
schedules
stating
plainly
the
change
or
changes
to
be
made
in
the
schedule
or
schedules
then
enforced
and
the
time
when
the
change
or
changes
will
go
into
effect.”
now,
notice
that
it
says
new
schedule.
no
change
shall
be
made
in
any
rate
or
contract
except
by
filing
new
schedules,
not
by
filing
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
reading
from
section
4
(e),
at
the
bottom
of
page
--
4
(d)
at
the
bottom
of
page
101,
unless
the
commission
orders,
no
change
shall
be
made
except
after
30
days
notice.
such
notice
shall
be
given
by
filing
with
the
commission
and
keeping
open
for
public
inspection
new
schedules.
now,
new
schedules
are
schedules
of
rates,
not
contracts.
it
doesn't
imply
that
there
must
be
agreement
of
the
other
party.
it's
the
public,
the
natural
gas
company
which
must
file
the
new
schedule
stating
the
change
and
the
time
when
the
change
or
changes
will
go
into
effect.
they
will
go
into
effect,
no
question
about
it.
statute
makes
them
go
into
effect.
the
question
is
then
whether
mobile
is
right
in
saying
that
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
pardon?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
says
no
change
shall
be
made
in
any
rate
or
contract
relating
thereto
except,
except
after
notice.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
the
paragraph
beginning
on
the
middle
of
101
(d),
“unless
the
commission
otherwise
ordered,
no
change
shall
be
made
by
any
natural
gas
company
in
any
such
rate,
charge,
classification
or
service
or
in
any
rule,
regulation
or
contract
relating
thereto
except
after
30
days
notice
to
the
commission
and
to
the
public.”
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
'unless'
is
what
is
taken
care
of
the
last
clause
in
the
paragraph,
the
last
sentence
which
begins
two
lines
from
the
bottom
of
101.
“the
commission
for
good
cause
shall
and
may
allow
changes
to
take
effect
without
requiring
the
30
days
notice.”
that's
just
the
waiver
of
the
notice
that
i
spoke
of
before.
we
can
forget
that
then.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
there's
no
question
as
to
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
no.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
well,
i
have
no
doubt
you
could
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there's
--
there's
no
problem
there.
that
--
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
agree
with
you,
but
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
no
other
order
here.
the
commission
has
not
otherwise
ordered.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
it's
not
relevant
here.
there's
no
--
no
issue
i
think
between
us
on
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'd
like
a
chance
to
think
about
that
some
more.
it's
never
been
suggested.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
possibility
on
that
(voice
overlap).
the
suspension
section
is
in
(e).
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
is
in
(e)
and
this
is
a
separate
section.
i
think
there
is
no
relation
between
the
suspension
power
and
this.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
know,
but
--
so
far
as
i
know,
there's
nothing
in
the
case
law
or
in
the
practice
or
in
the
issues
it
have
been
raised.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
the
contracts
we
say
are
as
a
result
of
the
statute,
subject
to
modification
by
whatever
rate
is
lawfully
effective
under
this
statute.
the
contracts
are
therefore
modifiable
and
as
modified,
they
are
enforceable
as
contracts
and
continuous
contracts.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
--
it
would
--
it
would
put
it
beyond
the
power
of
regulation
to
control.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
the
--
the
public
interest
as
stated
here
is
in
the
maintenance
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
a
rate
that
is
too
low
doesn't
have
to
be
so
low
as
to
make
the
company
go
bankrupt.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
company
is
continuing
to
earn
a
sufficient
rate
of
return
that
will
enable
it
to
finance
additions
and
betterments
and
not
raise
its
cost
of
money
which
would
adversely
affect
the
public
interest.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
it
had
been
but
costs
were
going
up.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
had
been
no
determination
by
the
commission
that
this
was
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
as
soon
as
this
increase
was
filed,
the
commission
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
it
had
been
filed.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
was
the
lawful
rate.
its
reasonableness
had
never
been
determined.
there
was
a
proceeding
before
the
commission
pending
to
determine
that
and
it
had
not
been
resolved.
meanwhile,
that
proceeding
was
pending.
this
increase
was
filed
and
the
commission
said
that
it
could
not
reject
the
increase.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
the
commission
already
had
a
proceeding.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
under
section
5
(a),
anybody
but
the
seller
virtually,
i
might
say.
the
seller
is
one
that
may
not
initiate
a
complaint.
a
state
commission
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
mobile
could
have,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
no,
there's
a
--
there
was
a
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
mobile
objected
and
as
a
result
and
the
commission
did
set
the
rate
down
for
investigation.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
they
--
that
was
the
proceeding
with
which
this
was
consolidated.
now,
i
have
arranged
to
divide
my
time
with
other
counsel
and
i
haven't
forgotten
my
argument,
but
i
feel
an
injustice
to
my
other
counsel.
i've
got
to
give
him
that
time.
