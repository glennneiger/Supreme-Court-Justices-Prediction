mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
a
remark
made
by
your
honor
referred
me
to
my
pencilled
notes
which
--
in
which
i
said
to
remind
myself
that
i
thought
that
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
to
have
this
court
decide
de
novo
something
that
had
been
previously
decided
by
three
courts
in
pennsylvania.
and
i
think
that
same
feeling
was
expressed
in
the
uveges
case
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
when
he
said,
â€œafter
all,
this
is
the
nation's
ultimate
judicial
tribunal,
not
a
super
legal
aid
bureau."
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
not
on
the
question
of
the
truths
or
falsity
of
--
of
his
allegations,
your
honor.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well,
he
didn't
have
a
hearing
of
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
well,
three
courts
decided
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
this
ingredient
of
unfairness
on
the
record
of
the
case.
see,
the
--
the
record
of
his
plea
and
the
attending
circumstances
were
first
and
--
and
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
were
first
considered
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
if
the
--
if
the
record
in
itself
refutes
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner
--
of
the
petitioner's
complaint.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
by
inference,
i
would
say,
your
honor.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
if
not
--
if
not
diametrically.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well,
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
this.
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
judge
who
sentenced
him
--
sentenced
this
defendant.
now,
this
is
his
opinion
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
he
makes
the
statement
of
fact
pertaining
to
the
record.
now,
the
petitioner
have
not
seen
fit
to
incorporate
this
is
a
matter
of
record,
but
this
is
a
statement
of
fact
by
the
present
judges,
a
common
plea
and
i
can
assume
that
--
that
we
can
assume
that
he
was
telling
the
truth.
he
would
have
no
occasion
to
do
otherwise.
in
pennsylvania,
your
honor,
a
criminal
prosecution
ordinarily
is
instituted
by
the
filing
of
a
--
of
an
information
in
the
office
of
the
justice
of
the
peace.
the
defendant
is
--
is
brought
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
at
which
time
he
can
either
plead
guilt
--
guilty
or
not
guilty.
he
can
demand
a
hearing
or
he
can
waive
it
to
court
in
most
instances.
now,
on
the
same
day,
your
honor,
that
this
man
was
arrested,
not
72
hours
later
as
they
would
have
to
believe
in
this
petition
sets
forth.
this
man,
a
warrant
was
issued
for
him.
he
was
arrested
and
brought
before
the
alderman
and
he
demanded
a
hearing
on
each
information
and
a
hearing
was
held
at
that
time
on
each
information,
witnesses
were
produced
and
defendant
was
also
sworn
admitting
in
each
case
the
offense
charged
in
the
information
whereupon
he
was
committed.
in
other
words,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
argue
in
here
that
he
was
choked
into
submission,
that
confession
was
forced
out
of
him
when
actually,
the
criminal
prosecution
began
in
the
normal
orderly
way
in
pennsylvania
and
after
a
hearing
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well,
he
was
put
in
jail.
i
don't
--
there's
nothing
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
--
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
was
held
incommunicado
except
his
own
statement.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
he
also
makes
a
statement
that
friends
and
nobody
came
to
visit
him.
well
obviously,
his
wife
didn't
come.
he
had
forged
her
name
to
seven
checks.
you
couldn't
--
no
one
could
expect
her
to
be
very
anxious,
the
same
so
that
--
but
the
sentence
of
the
court
was
not
until
six
or
seven
weeks
after
this
took
place.
the
man
was
in
the
local
jail.
the
man
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
--
to
fellow
prisoners
and
it's
--
it's
recalled
that
it
--
to
this
court's
attention,
that
this
man
is
a
previous
--
had
a
previous
conviction.
he
was
convicted
incidentally
for
the
same
charges,
burglary,
larceny
and
forgery.
he
received
a
very
mild
sentence.
i
believe
was
six
months
to
a
year.
he
had
enough
legal
astuteness
to
obtain
a
parole
which
--
which
has
to
be
done
by
petition
so
that
the
man
did
have
experience
in
court.
now,
referring
to
the
sentence,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner's
argument
of
what
the
sentence
of
more
or
less
refutes
their
own
--
their
own
contention.
the
minimum
sentence
under
which
this
man
could
have
been
given
was
157
years
and
he
was
given
17
1/2
years.
that
scarcely
bears
out
the
statement
by
counsel
that
the
judge
was
hostile
and
--
and
was
unfair
and
unfriendly
to
this
defendant.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
except
to
the
fact
that
there
are
a
number
of
them
involuntary,
yes.
mr.
justice
woodside
did
say
that
and
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
when
the
court
ask
about
what
is
the
rule
in
pennsylvania
concerning
counsel
that
in
this
instant
case,
mr.
justice
woodside
basis
his
--
his
opinion
on
the
uveges
case.
in
other
words,
this
case
is
already
been
decided
in
a
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
on
the
basis
of
the
uveges
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
page
24
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
woodside
quotes
from
the
part
of
it
where
he
says,
"you,
lack
of
education
and
experience
with
the
intricacies
of
criminal
procedure,
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
court
or
prosecuting
officials
and
a
competent
nature
of
the
offense
charged
may
in
some
combination
constitute
the
ingredient
of
unfairness
which
renders
the
absence
of
counsel
at
sentencing
a
denial
of
due
process."
and
following
this
court's
own
decision,
mr.
justice
woodside
decided
in
this
case
for
the
second
time
that
there
was
not
that
ingredient
of
unfairness.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
on
its
facts,
the
uveges
case
for
example,
the
uveges
boy
was
younger
than
this
boy,
considerably
younger
when
you
consider
how
a
person
can
mature
from,
let
us
say
16
to
19.
the
sentence
maximums
--
or
the
sentence
impose
in
the
uveges
case
is
greater
than
the
sentence
actually
imposed
in
this
case.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
think,
it
was
20
years,
if
i'm
--
20
to
40,
it
was
17
1/2
to
--
to
35
in
this
case
but
of
course
this
case
involved
many
crimes.
i
don't
believe
in
the
uveges
case
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
speak
up
for
himself
as
he
had
in
this
case.
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
just
read
two
paragraphs
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
now,
just
a
second,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
in
the
uveges
case,
you
have
--
that
uveges
had
the
mentality
that
this
defendant
has.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
no.
i
--
my
recollection,
it
fails
me
on
that,
your
honor.
there's
one
of
the
cases,
i
thought
it
was
the
uveges
case
where
they
brought
up
that
question
of
his
lack
of
--
of
mentality,
i
--
i
maybe
mistaken.
but
this
boy
had
a
grade
school
education.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well,
the
--
there
seems
to
be
different
allegations,
the
--
the
superior
court
seems
to
find
that
he
had
a
grammar
school
education.
the
petitioner
seems
to
say
he
had
a
six
year
grade
school
education.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
only
the
statement
by
the
superior
court
judges
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
grammar
school
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that
would
be
my
impression
of
it.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
--
i
wouldn't
like
to
state
it
as
a
fact,
something
that
was
not
--
which
had
not
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
--
as
i
recall
that
the
--
the
time
element
between
the
arrest
and
the
ultimate
sentence
was
less
in
the
uveges
case
as
i
recall
them.
in
other
words,
this
man
have
seven
weeks
to
--
in
which
to
contemplate
to
secure
counsel,
to
talk
to
his
fellow
prisoners
or
whatever
he
wanted
to
do
within
those
seven
weeks.
after
all
the
--
the
last
uveges
boy
was
--
was
a
juvenile,
as
i
recall.
but
i
would
like
to
--
to
read
the
court
just
the
beginning
of
what
took
place
when
this
defendant
came
before
the
bar
to
plead
guilty.
the
district
attorney
and
incidentally,
i'm
defending
my
predecessor,
not
myself,
your
honor.
if
that
please
your
honor,
stephen
j.
herman
of
washington
is
entering
his
plea
of
guilty
to
various
indictments
and
counts
drawn
at
number
56,
november
term
--
63,
november
term
inclusive
for
the
following
offences.
i'm
reading
from
page
10
of
the
record
your
honor.
i
will
try
to
take
them
in
chronological
order.
at
number
61,
november
term
1945,
this
defendant
is
charge
with
larceny
involving
three
counts.
the
first
of
an
automobile,
a
1939
ford
belonging
to
the
union
transfer
company
of
waynesburg
where
he
stole
--
where
he
stole,
unlawfully
took
it
at
brownsville
in
washington
county,
the
value
of
said
automobile
$950.
that
took
place
on
may
26
of
this
year,
the
second
count
in
the
same
indictment
at
61,
november
term,
charges
him
with
larceny
at
west
brownsville
on
august
5th
of
a
1941
chevrolet
automobile,
bearing
west
virginia
registration
plates
of
property
of
(inaudible)
of
morgantown
west
virginia.
now,
to
skip
down,
at
number
62,
november
term
1945
stephen
j.
herman
--
entering
--
is
entering
his
plea
to
guilty
of
charge
of
burglary
and
larceny.
this
involves
a
breaking
in
to
on
march
21st
of
1945,
saint
patrick
church
6212
greenside
avenue
in
canonsburg,
which
is
incidentally
40
miles
away
from
the
other
places
where
he
gained
entrance
to
a
rear
window
and
broke
into
two
--
four
boxes
and
from
the
one
stole
approximately
$20
in
cash
and
approximately
$6
dollars
in
cash
from
the
others.
he
made
his
get
away
after
he
completed
this
burglary
and
larceny
in
a
car
that
was
stolen
at
canonsburg.
now,
how
can
it
be
said,
your
honor,
that
anyone
can
stand
in
front
of
the
bar
of
a
court,
21
years
old
and
have
with
that
particularity
charges
read
to
him
and
not
say
anything
in
his
own
defense
if
there
was
anything
to
say,
protect
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
all
he
said.
there
was
nothing
said
about
being
not
guilty
of
those
charges
which
were
read
to
him
in
particularity.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
just
read
enough
to
--
to
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
this
wasn't
a
question
of
taking
this
man
up
in
front
of
the
bar
and
just
sentencing
him
without
making
him
completely
aware
of
what
he
was
charged
with.
the
court
also,
the
record
shows
that
this
petitioner
had
been
paroled
from
a
previous
defense
of
burglary,
larceny,
and
forgery.
that
in
addition
to
these
crimes
he
committed,
he
had
also
violated
that
parole.
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
--
your
honors
that
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
are
in
complete
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down
in
the
uveges
case.
and
that,
as
what
this
court
is
being
asked
to
do
and
what
this
court
will
be
asked
to
do
in
the
future
in
these
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
is
to
review
de
novo
the
records
contained
and
scrutinized
by
the
lower
court
and
the
intermediate
courts
of
pennsylvania.
now,
there
has
been
some
mention
of
the
supreme
court
having
not
passed
on
anything.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
has
got
at
the
source
of
all
this
difficulty
and
that
is
that
the
ordinary
small
county
in
pennsylvania
or
even
the
large
counties
that
courts
are
so
filled,
so
worked
on
criminal
matters
and
particularly,
its
habeas
corpuses
that
the
practice
has
--
has
necessarily
grown
to
be
rather
--
rather
lax.
i
--
i
--
however,
to
correct
that
would
probably
mean
a
reshuffling
or
recodification
of
a
lot
of
the
--
of
the
criminal
procedures
in
pennsylvania.
perhaps,
the
addition
of
new
judges
and
court
reporters,
we
have
difficulty
in
the
lower
courts
in
getting
court
reporters
that
are
available
for
all
these
things.
as
a
matter
fact,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
i
mentioned
it
or
not,
but
i
believed
that
there
is
in
the
congress
now
or
in
a
committee,
a
bill
sponsored
by
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
prosecutor
time
to
make
the
--
the
question
of
the
defense
of
criminals
in
federal
courts
either
to
safeguard
the
more
or
to
make
it
more
uniform.
and
apparently,
there's
a
--
there's
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
people
as
represented
by
their
congressman
because
that
bill
as
yet
not
pass
congress.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
--
and
in
addition
to
what
we've
discussed,
your
old
english
method
of
proceeding
through
your
justices
of
the
peace
and
alderman
which
are
not
actually
courts
of
record,
at
least
all
that
not
part
of
the
record
which
would
have
a
great
deal
of
effect
on
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case
in
order
to
show
what
had
happened
in
the
justice
of
peace
office.
i
had
to
rely
on
a
statement
made
by
the
common
pleas
court
in
his
decision,
so
that
the
--
the
procedures
are,
let
us
say,
antiquated
and
how
would
that
probably
can
only
be
corrected
by
statute.
however,
your
honor
i
might
further
add
that
we're
deluged
with
habeas
corpuses
and
the
--
it
seems
that
every
one
in
the
penitentiary
understand
that
for
$2
you
can
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
written
for
him
and
consequently
we
get
them.
they
all
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
it's
a
--
creates
an
amazing
amount
of
paperwork,
not
only
for
the
various
clerks
and
the
district
attorney
but
also
for
the
judges.
and
if
the
judges
seem
to
treat
them
perhaps
more
lightly
than
the
federal
courts
treat
them,
it
is
because
they
are
constantly
confronted
with
cases
that
have
no
merit
on
the
face
of
them
whatsoever.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
it's
been
--
your
honor,
its
--
if
we
wish
to
be
practical
about
it,
it's
been
my
thought
that
at
sometime
when
a
petition
was
presented,
and
i
knew
was
--
was
false
of
having
the
hearing
and
possibly
convicted
petitioner
forgery
if
he
persisted
in
testifying
towards
one
who
was
entirely
contradicted
by
the
record.
but
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
it
is
except
that,
i
think,
its
probably
statutory
your
honor
rather
than
be
corrected
by
this
court
because
this
court
shouldn't
be
required
to
review
case
after
case
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well,
he
could
--
one
thing,
the
attorney
general
or
justice
woodside
suggested
was,
of
course,
he
could
file
a
petition
with
the
pardon
board.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
it
is
a
judicial
proceeding
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
--
raised
--
whether
it
raised
the
question
your
honor
suggest.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well,
he
--
he
never
would
get
a
remedy,
that's
a
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
think
your
honor,
that
if
the
lower
court,
and
i
know
we
have
held
hearings
that
let
us
--
the
court
not
in
--
take
it
for
granted,
that
we
hold
no
hearing
in
these
cases.
of
course,
we
hold
hearings
and
cases
where
the
--
the
lower
court
feels
there's
enough
merit
in
the
petition
and
on
the
record
to
warrant
a
hearing,
but
its
only
in
the
cases
where
they
--
they
feel
that
a
--
a
hearing
is
not
justified
that
they
don't
hold
a
hearing.
so,
we've
held
many
--
many
hearings
even
during
my
slight
term
of
district
attorney,
your
honor
so
that
they've
--
they
--
they
--
the
court
takes
the
attitude
of
trying
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
shaft.
and
if
the
petition
on
the
record
thinks
they've
made
out
a
good
case
then
the
court
will
grant
that
hearing.
now,
your
honors
will
also
understand
that
while
there
is
a
record
the
--
there
are
many
things
that
take
place
on
this
cases
and
are
not
actually
a
matter
of
record.
of
which
the
lower
court
had
has
knowledge
of
a
lot
of
statements
made
perhaps
and
aren't
even
part
of
the
record.
so
that
the
--
we
--
when
the
case
reaches
this
court
it's
on
a
very
major
record
where
the
petitioners
trying
to
take
advantage
of
every
discrepancy
that
can
be
found.
i
might
add
while
we're
on
the
subject
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
sir?
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
yes.
a
hearing
would
cure
it,
your
honor.
but
as
i
say
if
the
court
doesn't
feel
that
the
--
that
the
hearing
is
a
--
is
justified
then
the
court
writes
an
opinion
on
the
--
on
--
on
what
he
--
on
the
record.
i'm
--
i
might
also
add,
and
this
is
not
prejudicial
because
this
does
not
exist
in
this
case
that
it's
amazing
in
how
many
of
these
belated
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
that
they
coincide
with
the
demise
of
some
witness
or
that
corner
someone
else.
however,
i'll
say
in
all
fairness
that
--
that's
not
true
in
this
case.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
certainly,
sir.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
--
i
will
say
this,
your
honor.
i've
been
district
attorney
four
years,
and
everybody
has
--
has
been
offered
the
right
to
counsel.
now,
this
took
place
before
that.
i
think
that
your
court
decisions
have
gradually
convinced
the
--
the
courts
and
district
attorneys
of
pennsylvania
that
as
a
matter
of
self-protection
that
they
--
they
should
follow
that
procedure.
and
i
can
assure
you
that
they
--
they
are
provided
with
counsel
at
the
present
time.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
line
is
rather
theoretical
rather
than
practical.
in
other
words,
the
law
says
certain
crimes
constitute
felonies
or
felonies
are
triable
in
a
court,
and
we
call
it
a
lawyer
intermitter.
misdemeanors
are
tried
in
a
court
of
quarter
sessions
and
the
--
there
are
certain
distinctions
which
--
however,
as
i
say
are
theoretical.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
hate
to
shock
the
court,
but
i
would
say
that
95%
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
think
95%.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
particularly
where
the
state
police
are
involved.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
right.
we
--
now
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
we
--
we
have
four
terms
of
grand
jury
a
year
where
we
dispose
of
any
place
from
150
to
200
cases
which
include
most
of
misdemeanors
and
felony.
and
i
suppose
that
they
fall
by
the
waysides
for
one
reason
or
the
other,
your
honor.
but
i
would
say
that
we
probably
don't
try
over
25
cases
a
year.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
150,000
to
200,000
people.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
can
bring
it
by
information
in
front
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
we
can
--
we
can
do
it
by
a
district
attorney's
bill.
however,
it's
usually
done
by
an
--
an
information
of
the
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
no.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
talking
about
the
subject
we
were
that
probably,
if
that
were
required,
that
might
solve
this
problem
of
great
extent.
because
after
all
what
does
a
man
sentenced
to
a
long
term
in
the
penitentiary
have
to
lose
by
signing
an
affidavit
to
anything.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
right.
and
as
i
say,
that
i
think
that
it
should
be
corrected
by
statute
and
the
court
should
not
be
put
to
the
tremendous
burden
to
which
they're
put,
both
the
federal
and
the
state
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
about
the
what
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
--
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
about
the
72-hour
period?
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
of
course,
you
have
the
bare
statement
by
the
defendant
that
he
was
the
petitioner,
that
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
washington
county
jail
and
having
--
had
a
lot
to
do
with
the
jail
during
past
few
years.
i
don't
know
why
the
placing
him
in
the
women's
quarters
would
make
it
any
different
from
being
in
the
men's
quarters.
however,
i
imagine
that
they
did
place
--
seem
in
a
place
which
would
give
them
time
enough
to
investigate
these
matters
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
information
should
be
lodged
or
whether
he
should
be
released.
in
other
words,
the
state
police
probably
had
enough
information
upon
which
to
--
to
lodge
him
on
a
warrant
in
the
jail
but
in
order
to
hold
him
before
the
justice
of
the
peace,
they
probably
made
it
sometime
to
corroborate
the
other
matters.
that
would
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
--
of
--
of
pennsylvania
said
that
that
isn't
an
unreasonable
time.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
but
nevertheless,
the
--
the
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
but
the
--
the
officers
of
pennsylvania
state
police
would
not
prosecute
the
man
or
--
or
proceed
before
they
first
tried
to
get
corroborating
testimony
because
they
--
that
prosecutor
wants
more
than
a
mere
confession.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
think
that
--
this
answer
which
i
didn't
personally
prepare
says
that
the
--
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
my
office
after
consulting
with
the
state
policeman
who
was
alleged
to
have
done
it
denies
it
on
the
ground
that
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor,
because
that
being
signed
by
an
assistant
district
attorney,
he
is
an
officer
of
our
court,
under
our
court
theory.
so,
he
would
--
he
would
not
be
in
a
--
his
words
should
be
the
same
as
having
been
verified
by
some
layman.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
no.
no,
no.
of
this
sentence?
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
no.
only
from
a
--
only
from
knowledge
which
--
which
he
had
--
had
gathered
from
--
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
and
like
he
says,
i
believe,
that
he
consulted
that
state
policeman.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
the
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i'll
--
i'm
reluctant
to
admit
it
was
very
poorly
phrased.
mr.
wray
g.
zelt,
jr.
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
