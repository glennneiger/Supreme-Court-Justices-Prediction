mr.
levy,
i'm
--
i'm
left
somewhat
uncertain
as
to
the
pennsylvania
procedure
as
to
what
sort
of
hearing
this
man
had
in
the
appellate
courts,
superior
courts,
you
call
it,
don't
you?
there's
--
there
the
--
the
only
opinion
we
have
is
in
there
which
points
out
that
the
--
the
record
of
the
former
trial
was
before
this
court,
is
that
--
that
is
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
and
his
hearing
and
what
step
were
taken?was
--
is
that
record
here
before
us?
unknown
speaker
is
here?
unknown
speaker
it's
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
the
statement
made
in
the
superior
court,
is
that
--
do
you
challenge
that
anyway?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
you
to
challenge
the
end
result
of
that,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
challenge
the
factual
statement
we
made
certain?
unknown
speaker
i
have
it
here
before
me,
it
shows
that
defendant
stood
at
the
,
the
assistant
district
attorney
advised
the
court,
the
various
statements
in
regard
to
what
has
gone
through.
unknown
speaker
you
--
you
don't
contend
that
he
was
mentally
invalid,
of
course?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but
--
but
was
not
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
habeas
corpus
filed
at
the
same
court
or
before
the
same
judge
that
had
taken
his
plea
of
guilty?
unknown
speaker
you
--
you
say
that
he
wasn't
unable
to
present
his
defense
--
he
wasn't
unable
to
present
his
defense,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
a
defense?
unknown
speaker
in
one
case,
the
sentence
he
got
was
within
the
limit
that
the
court
might
have
given
him.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
assume
in
your
argument
that
the
--
that
the
court
that
heard
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
had
a
right
to
report
it
to
that
hearing
all
that
he
had
learned
of
the
former
hearing?
certainly,
you'd
say
he
could
so
far
as
the
record
show
that.
unknown
speaker
but,
there
was
no
opinion
by
the
--
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
opinion
by
the
court
to
refuse
the
habeas
corpus
there?
unknown
speaker
except
the
denial,
which
--
what
you're
talking
about,
uveges
or
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
was
talking
about
your
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
i
noticed
the
county
court
of
--
court
of
common
pleas
on
page
19,
it
says,
many
of
this
(inaudible)
were
--
runs
concurrent.
unknown
speaker
so,
we
go
additional
time,
do
you
take
the
--
your
consideration
goes
down
to
as
what
you
say
as
to
having
150
odd
years.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
length
of
time
that
we
have
to
serve
to?
unknown
speaker
the
court
says
here,
17
years.
unknown
speaker
was
not
150?
unknown
speaker
but
you
read
it
out
from
there,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
court
says
here
that
to
promulgate
or
(inaudible)
to
get
as
much
as
17
1/2
years
might
have
a
counsel.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
fact
(inaudible)
to
proceed
on
any
one
offense?
unknown
speaker
any
one
of
that.
unknown
speaker
20
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
one
thought
that
i
can
ask
about.
if
it
--
would
you
say
that
the
fair
statement,
the
rule
of
--
that's
a
part
in
uveges,
that
that
is
dependent
on
the
circumstances
to
the
--
who's
better
then
to
judge
that,
couldn't
the
--
the
judge
himself
who
had
these
facts
before
him
and
the
allegations.
if
--
this
is
like
the
--
we've
had
other
--
other
cases
here,
i
won't
be
specific
but
we
were
--
the
judge
has
(inaudible)
with
some
hostilities
and
so
forth
against
the
accused.
unknown
speaker
here,
hearing
the
--
the
hearings
of
a
man
who
had
the
man
before
him,
they
heard
his
plea,
who
--
maybe
the
sentences.
then
on
--
on
habeas
corpus
grounds
he
has
all
the
matters
a
part
of
the
background
for
making
conclusions
as
to
whether
he
was
unfairly
treated.
it's
a
mere
fact
that
he
himself
sat
with
the
other
case
to
debar
him
as
the
judge
in
reaching
his
proper
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
starting
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
--
it's
very
simple
when
you
have
a
charge
that
involves
a
death
sentence,
it
says,
you
always
have
to
have
a
counsel
in
this
way.
the
court
will
be
very
simple
to
solve
the
whole
problem
by
saying
always,
he
must
have
a
counsel
if
you
have
any
crime
(inaudible)
of
any
crime
that's
also
a
sentence.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a
--
well,
it's
never
--
never
go
to
that
extent,
the
state
courts
and
--
unknown
speaker
they
say
you
don't
even
suggest
that
he
should.
but
when
it
comes
to
a
mere
question
of
appraisal
of
the
situation
that
each
person,
how
you're
going
to
improve
on
what
you
have
now,
is
you
look
at
all
those
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
going
to
lose
better
to
the
(inaudible)
how
the
trial
is
going.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
subject
to
change
when
he
is
open
then
obviously
violated
in
a
fair
hearing.
unknown
speaker
two
judges
have
done
that.
unknown
speaker
ms.
--
as
i
understood
your
statement
of
pennsylvania
law,
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
or
to
advise
of
the
right
to
counsel,
is
not
a
denial
of
due
process
in
itself
unless
there
are
some
unfair
ingredients
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
the
picture.
now,
will
you
enumerate
in
fair
--
unfair
ingredients
here
that
you
rely
upon?
unknown
speaker
what
--
to
what
was
the
total
sentence
he
might
have
given
him
on
the
three
that
he
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to?
unknown
speaker
do
you
consider
that
harmful
error,
if
it
were
error?
unknown
speaker
yes.
in
lieu
of
the
sentence
that
he
got,
would
that
had
been
harmful
error
in
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
didn't
have.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
has
--
has
everybody
any
statute
or
ruling
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
requiring
that
after
for
habeas
corpus
to
file
affidavits
to
the
correctness
of
his
charges
was
sustained
by
other
parties
than
himself,
with
his
own
affidavit
and
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
those
matters
been
largely
in
the
--
it's
all
of
the
states
to
what
procedure
to
--
unknown
speaker
of
course,
he
admitted,
did
he
not,
he
had
admitted
committing
burglaries,
felonies?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
--
in
open
court
and
the
court
had
expressed
in
that
way
anything
to
say,
why
he's
on
parole
and
the
court
asked
him
about
his
own
parole,
he
had
committed
other
felonies
and
burglaries.
he
said,
yes,
in
an
open
court.
unknown
speaker
that
was
after
the
confession
as
they
point
it
out.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
hearing
then
would've
possibly
(inaudible)
testifying
that
being
killed,
and
you
denied
that
that
i
suppose
the
officer
(inaudible)
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
trial
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
he
has
been
(inaudible)
to
the
judge
if
he
had
committed
felonies,
burglaries,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
open
court.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
the
point
on
page
13,
14,
15
and
16
was
not
terms
of
question
and
answer
of
--
or
question
by
the
judge,
"are
you
guilty?
it
was
sort
of
a,
i
might
say,
a
consultation
between
he
and
the
judge
going,
“oh
my,
you
did
this.”
and
that's
the
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
appeared
to
me
here
for
example
on
page
16,
he
talks
about
--
the
court
asked
him
if
he
secured
a
parole
on
the
counts
of
good
behavior
and
he
said,
yes,
(inaudible)
in
the
mean
time,
he
committed
(inaudible)
these
offenses,
and
many
of
them,
i
understand
with
the
district
attorney
with
forgeries,
and
he
answered
there
in
open
court,
without
anybody
(inaudible)
him
in
there,
and
that
i'm
sure,
a
month
and
half
out
after
that.
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
now,
you
want
the
court
to
have
mercy.
as
a
man,
i'm
being
merciful,
the
court
said.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
