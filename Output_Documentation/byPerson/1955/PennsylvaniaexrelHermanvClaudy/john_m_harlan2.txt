how
long
was
the
time
of
that
prior
plea
has
gone
down?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
why
eight
years
elapsed
before
this
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
you
--
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
go
ahead.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
your
position,
we
don't
have
to
go
as
far
as
that
to
bring
the
matter
of
reversal,
your
argument
is
something
here
that
you
think
might
make
a
good
rule
to
the
future,
but
it
isn't
necessarily
the
limits
of
your
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
a
sort
of
a
weasel
word
of
denial,
isn't
it?
it
is
denied
that
the
statement
here
made
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
order
to
obtain
pleas
in
the
charges
involved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
have
a
lawyer
before
the
justice
of
the
peace?
