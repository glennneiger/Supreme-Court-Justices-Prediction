on
the
docket,
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
on
the
relation
of
stephen
j.
herman,
petitioner
versus
dr.
john
w.
claudy,
warden.
mr.
levy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
mr.
levy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
habeas
corpus
was
it,
mr.
levy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
superior.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
levy,
to
revert
to
your
suggestion
that
this
court
formulate
a
--
a
rule
compelling
counsel
and
all
cases
that
involve
life
imprisonment.
now,
in
this
case
it
was
only
the
large
number
of
years
that
--
that
were
involved
that
--
that
impulse
us
to
the
idea
that
it
could
be
a
life
imprisonment
case
but
what
number
of
years
would
you
consider
in
such
a
rule
would
be
the
equivalent
of
--
of
life
imprisonment,
it
might
be?
thirty,
might
be
40,
might
be
50
in
this
case,
i
think,
you
said
it
was
157
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
something
of
that
kind
but
what
number
of
years
would
you
--
have
you
given
any
thought
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
watson.
ms.
matson,
i
beg
you
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
those
dates
again
please?
your
petition
was
filed
with
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that
ms.
matson,
may
i
ask
you
this.
i
notice
your
petition
was
verified.
i
noticed
that
the
--
the
response
of
the
district
attorney
was
not
verified.
is
there
any
difference
between
a
--
a
verified
answer
and
a
non-verified
ones
so
far
as
it's
effect
is
concerned
in
pennsylvania?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is,
it
would
have
no
greater
legal
effect
if
--
if
it
had
been
verified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may.
but
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
here?
i
noticed
in
your
petition,
you
say
that
at
this
time
the
assistant
district
attorney
frank
j.
(inaudible)
demanded
that
defendant
sign
pleas
to
all
laid
indictments.
and
when
defendant
asked
what
he
was
signing,
the
reply
was,
"sign
your
name
and
forget
it."
that
is
not
denied,
is
it
or
isn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
zelt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
zelt,
did
--
did
this
man
have
any
hearing
on
his
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
did
he
have
the
hearing
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
had
no
hearing
instead
of
having
three
courts
decided
as
you've
said
a
moment
ago?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
habeas
corpus
limited
in
your
state
to
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
in
this
case
refute
everything
that
it's
in
the
complaint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
inference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
take
for
instance
the
--
the
enforced
confession.what
is
there
that
you
can
point
to
in
the
record
that
shows
at
that
--
that
allegation
is
untrue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
held
incommunicado
for
72
hours
after
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
your
supreme
court
point
out
that
even
the
time
he
has
served
is
a
rather
abnormal
time
in
pennsylvania
for
a
crime
that
does
not
involve
violence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
distinguish
uveges
from
this
case
on
its
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
sentence
in
the
uveges
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
the
only
--
are
those
the
only
facts
that
you
distinguish
two
cases
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
said
in
the
uveges
case
that
he
doesn't
have
as
much
mentality
as
this
boy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
--
how
much
of
a
grade
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
did
go
beyond
the
six
--
sixth
grade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
that
he
graduated
from
high
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
graduated
from
grammar
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
all,
just
because
you
said
he
had
grammar
school
education.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
other
distinctions
on
the
fact
between
these
in
uveges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
zelt,
just
--
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
all
the
--
all
the
allegations
in
--
in
this
petition
are
--
are
true,
concerning
the
enforced
confession
and
so
forth.
how
can
this
man
ever
raise
them?
how
can
he
ever
have
any
remedy
if
your
courts
refuse
to
give
him
a
hearing
as
was
done
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
well,
that
--
that
isn't
judicial
proceeding,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
clemency.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
clemency,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
distinguish
from
any
judicial
proceeding
but
--
but
how
would
he
judicially?
how
would
a
man
ever
get
his
remedy,
if
the
courts
refuse
to
give
him
a
hearing
on
a
petition
of
this
crime
such
as
was
refused
in
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pretty
harsh,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
the
hearing
cure
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
a
hearing
cure
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
zelt,
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
please
in
--
and
it
is,
what
is
the
practice
in
your
trial
courts
of
the
--
of
the
judge
advising
a
defendant
as
to
asking
him
is
--
if
he
has
counsel
and
advising
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.
is
there
such
a
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
zelt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
unverified
answer
have
any
legal
effect
in
your
procedure,
mr.
zelt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
mr.
roney
in
--
in
the
office
at
the
time
of
this
affair?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
the
things
that
he
answered
could
not
be
of
his
own
knowledge,
could
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
his
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
he
--
he
says
he
consulted
them.
but
for
instance,
he
says
here
in
answer
to
this
--
to
the
allegation
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
at
the
time
of
the
plea
told
him
to
sign
--
sign
the
pleas,
"sign
your
name
and
forget
it."
now,
your
answer
--
the
answer
of
--
of
your
office
is,
it
is
denied
that
the
statements
were
made
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
order
to
obtain
pleas
to
the
charges
involved.
now,
of
course
that's
no
denial
at
all
and
then
the
second
place,
it
would
have
to
be
hearsay
with
him,
wouldn't
it?
that
the
--
if
it
wasn't
done
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
matson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
other
point
you
wanted
to
make
but
didn't
have
enough
opportunity
to
make
ms.
matson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
