mr.
herbert
monte
levy
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
pennsylvania
courts.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
having
define
to
review
the
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
which
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
brought
to
set
aside
the
conviction
that
stephen
j.
herman
on
27
--
27
different
offenses
involving
charges
of
burglary,
larceny,
and
forgery.
the
two
claims
that
were
raised
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
preserves
throughout
the
appeal
and
now
presented
to
this
court
are
claims
firstly
of
denial
of
right
to
counsel
and
that
herman
was
never
told
of
the
right
to
be
appointed
by
counsel,
which
we
contend
he
had
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
secondly,
the
point
which
my
colleague
mrs.
matson
shall
argue,
the
fact
that
the
detention
of
this
man
incommunicado
for
72
hours
during
which
he
was
physically
assaulted
and
threatened
with
the
resultant
plea
of
guilty
amounted
in
itself
to
a
separate
and
independent
violation
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that
the
two
factors
is
taken
together,
certainly
warrant
of
reversal
of
the
conviction
below.
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
herman
was
arrested
in
september
of
1945.
he
was
a
youth
of
21-years
of
age.
he
had
about
six
years
of
elementary
school
work
or
an
education
equivalent
to
it.
he
was
held
for
72
hours
in
a
women's
quarters
of
the
city
jail
which
in
itself
might
have
had
some
sort
of
an
intimidatory
effect,
though
we
won't
press
that
point,
was
subjected
according
to
the
allegations
of
his
petition
to
a
physical
assault
by
police
officers
during
the
course
of
which
they
grabbed
him
by
the
throat
and
threatened
to
choke
him
if
he
did
not
confess.
and
threats
were
made
against
his
safety
and
the
safety
of
his
wife.
he
was
held
incommunicado
during
this
time.
as
a
result
of
it
at
the
end
of
the
three
days,
he
signed
a
form
entitled
"waiver
of
grand
jury"
an
entry
of
plea
and
he
agreed
in
that
form
to
plead
guilty
to
three
indictments
of
burglary,
larceny,
and
forgery.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
let
me
clarify
that
your
honor.
the
allegations
were
made
in
the
petition
according
to
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
in
this
case
and
there
other
decisions,
allegations
in
the
petition
where
there
is
no
hearing
held,
and
there
was
no
hearing
held
here
must
be
accepted
as
true
unless
contradicted
by
the
record.
there
were
denials
of
some
of
these
allegations
made
by
the
state
which
we
consider
to
be
irrelevant
because
the
cases
were
disposed
of
without
any
hearing
whatsoever.
and
therefore,
the
superior
--
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
where
all
came
into
play
that
therefore,
you
must
look
at
the
allegations
that
were
made
and
accept
them
as
true
because
uncontradicted
by
the
record.
there
is
only
one
thing
on
which
we
were
actually
contradicted
by
the
record
and
that
was
the
state
that
made
him
a
petition
to
the
effect
that
this
man
did
not
have
any
knowledge
of
the
charges
against
him,
whereas
in
fact
the
charges
have
been
read
to
him
in
some
detail
upon
his
guilty
plea.
and
so,
we
would
want
to
withdraw
and
abandon
any
claim
based
upon
that
but
everything
else
was
not
contradicted
by
the
record.
every
allegation
was
not
contradicted
by
the
record
and
therefore,
must
be
accepted
as
true
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
and,
of
course,
under
the
rule
of
this
case
being
announced
in
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania's
rule.
when
--
though
he
had
signed
an
agreement
to
plead
guilty
to
only
three
indictments
he
was
actually
held
for
27
--
27
different
offenses
represented
by
8
indictments.
he
was
taken
before
the
alderman
who
was
equivalent
there
to
a
justice
of
the
peace.
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
silent
as
to
what
transpired
before
that
alderman.
he
late
--
he
later
pleaded
guilty
in
open
court
and
to
all
of
these
offenses.
but,
at
no
time
was
he
advised
to
the
right
of
counsel.
now,
the
reason
we
consider
this
to
be
important
is
that
the
27
different
offenses
for
which
he
was
facing
sentence
involved
a
possibility,
a
maximum
potential
sentence
of
315
years
which
i
would
say
is
substantially
more
than
life
imprisonment.
the
offenses
were
quite
complex.
we
point
to
our
brief
--
in
our
brief
to
various
complex
questions
of
law
which
the
philadelphia
or
pittsburgh
lawyer
might
have
been
necessary
to
dig
out.
and
we
furthermore
point
out
that
the
man
was
prejudiced
by
the
failure
to
have
counsel
in
these
regards.he
also
alleged
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
his
right
to
counsel
whatsoever.
he
stated
in
his
petition
that
he
had
--
had
one
past
court
experience
without
benefit
of
counsel
and
that
he
did
not
know
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
was
unfamiliar
with
the
requirements
of
formal
courtroom
procedure.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
prior
plea
was
two
years
before,
i
believe.
he
would
have
been
19
at
the
time
and
he
was
given
no
counsel
then.
the
sentencing
judge
did
not
advise
him
at
all
of
the
possible
consequences
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
this
was
alleged.
again,
this
is
uncontradicted
by
the
record
as
is
everything
that
i
say
here.
the
district
attorney
merely
read
the
indictments
or
summarized
them
and
the
man,
his
plea
of
guilty
had
been
recorded
already
by
the
district
attorney.
and
also
at
this
particular
point
or
just
before
this
hearing
began,
the
district
attorney,
according
to
the
allegation
of
the
petition
here,
told
the
man
when
he
showed
him
the
indictments,
the
eight
indictments
with
the
27
different
offenses
listed
in
there,
sign
your
name
and
forget.
and
of
course
this
isn't
reflected
in
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
but,
of
course,
this
is
something
which
is
not
contradicted
either
by
those
transcripts
of
proceedings.
now
then,
i
think
in
some
is
really
the
essential
facts
of
this
particular
case.
we
urge
in
terms
of
the
right
to
counsel
that
this
case
is
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
this
court's
decision,
a
few
years
ago,
in
the
case
of
uveges
against
pennsylvania.
each
of
the
elements
relied
upon
there
was
here
in
this
case
perhaps
in
aggravated
degree.
in
the
uveges
case,
i
might
add
that
there
were
no
dissents
from
the
theory
of
the
case
whatsoever
and
the
only
dissents
were
on
purely
procedural
points
as
to
whether
the
various
constitutional
questions
had
been
preserved.
in
our
case,
as
i
mentioned,
the
man
was
21-years
of
age
with
a
limited
educational
background.
in
uveges
he
was
17.
in
uveges
he
was
faced
with
only
four
district
attorneys'
indictments.
here
he
was
faced
with
eight
involving
27
separate
offenses.
the
period
of
sentence
was
almost
identical
in
both
of
these
cases.
again,
the
claim
was
made
in
both
cases
that
there
was
no
informing
of
the
prisoner
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
that
counsel
was
not
advised,
was
not
offered
to
him
nor
was
he
advised
of
his
right
thereto.
and
again,
there
was
a
claim
in
both
cases
that
the
plea
of
guilty
was
under
the
direction
of
the
district
attorney.
here,
we
also
have
physical
threats
and
assault
at
the
first
time
which
was
not
present
in
the
uveges
case.
and
again
here
as
in
uveges,
there
was
just
one
instance
of
prior
criminal
experience
before.
and
again
in
both
cases
there
was
no
attempt
of
the
court
to
deal
with
the
prisoner
by
telling
him
of
his
rights.
now,
the
situation
was
even
more
serious
here
than
in
uveges
because
in
this
case
herman
faced
the
possibility
of
315
years
of
sentence.
i
might
explain
that
under
the
pennsylvania
practice
in
determining
sentences
are
given
that
the
minimum
sentence
can
be
almost
anything
but
can't
accept
that
it
cannot
rise
higher
than
one
half
of
the
maximum
possible
sentences.
so
that
actually,
the
sentence
with
which
herman
was
faced
was
between
a
157
1/2
years
to
315
years.
now
arguing,
we
--
we
recognize
first
--
i
--
i
trust
that
i
need
not
to
go
into
the
various
past
decisions
of
this
court
involving
the
distinction
between
capital
and
noncapital
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
must
find
some
ingredient
of
unfairness
and
the
man's
inability
to
handle
the
case
himself
before
you
could
find
the
violation
of
due
process.
i
think
that
under
that
theory,
we
have
the
uveges
case
here
all
over
again
in
a
slightly
aggravated
form
so
that
really,
little
may
be
said
we
said
about
that
particular
point.
for
myself,
i'm
interested
in
pressing
upon
this
court
the
theory.
i
don't
know
how
successful
i
am
going
to
be,
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
tenable
theory
in
one
which
would
help
the
administration
of
justice.
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
time
again
and
i
quite
agree
with
it,
that
it
is
impossible
to
lay
down
any
mathematical
formulation
of
the
due
process
rule
in
relation
to
questions
--
in
relation
to
right
to
counsel.
and
of
course
that
is
impossible
there
are
so
many
potential
variables
that
it
just
can't
be
done.
the
court
has
laid
down
only
one
ironclad
rule
that
in
capital
cases
there
must
be
counsel
and
you
don't
go
into
the
question
of
the
amount
of
punishment.
and
we'd
enter
the
amount
of
prejudice
necessary.
we
suggest
that
the
same
rule
should
be
applied
to
cases
in
which
a
man
faces
the
possibility
of
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole.
that
was
faced
here
because
parole
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
can
only
begin
to
run
after
the
minimum
sentence
has
been
served.
so,
the
man
might
have
found
that
he
go
to
sentence
minimum
157
1/2
years
and
no
possibility
of
parole
until
that
time
was
up.so
that
in
effect,
this
man
was
facing
a
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole.
now,
in
the
bute
case,
the
bute
v.
illinois
before
dissenters
suggested
and
it
was
indicated
in
uveges
that
a
number
of
the
court
members
felt
this
way.
that
in
every
case
where
there
is
a
serious
offense
charge,
there
must
be
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
in
state
fourteenth
amendment
cases.
and
in
uvegas
it
was
pointed
out
some
members
of
the
court
felt
that
and
others
felt
only
when
there
where
some
ingredient
of
unfairness
that
was
operating.
we
suggest
that
one
rule
of
thumb
which
the
court
can
lay
down,
is
the
rule
that
where
a
man
is
faced
with
the
possibility
of
a
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole,
which
i
shall
call
an
absolute
life
sentence
for
purposes
at
least
of
argument
that
in
that
case
too
there
is
a
requirement
of
an
absolute
right
to
counsel.
we
attempted,
john
finerty
and
i
when
we
handled
the
case
of
williams
against
new
york
before
this
court,
attempted
to
press
upon
it
there
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
life
imprisonment
and
execution
and
that
when
a
court
deviated
from
the
jury's
verdict
and
gave
a
death
sentence
of
the
jury
had
recommended
life
imprisonment.
we
argue
that
there
was
such
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
punishments
that
there
was
a
requirement
of
a
full
hearing
with
the
right
to
cross-examine
--
cross-examine
on
the
basis
of
probation
and
police
reports.
this
court
rejected
that
contention.it
refused
to
make
that
distinction
there
between
life
imprisonment
and
the
death
sentence.
what
i
now
urge
upon
the
court
is
that
the
court
refused
here
to
make
the
same
distinction
and
adopt
as
a
rule
of
thumb
the
idea,
the
rule
of
law
that
a
person
who
faces
a
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole
must
have
an
absolute
right
to
counsel.there
have
been
cases
before
this
court
in
which
a
man
faced
a
life
imprisonment
though
it
was
not
clear
whether
or
not
there
was
a
possibility
of
parole.
i
had
been
unable
to
find
any
indication
at
this
point
that
i'm
urging
upon
the
court
now
was
ever
pressed
upon
this
court
before.
we
think
it
has
validity
because
in
either
case
a
man's
life
was
forfeited
to
the
state.
in
either
case
the
charges
against
him
are
of
course
of
the
utmost
seriousness,
either
in
that
totality
or
singly.
in
either
case
the
man
is
faced
with
spending
his
life
in
jail,
a
living
death
or
to
be
executed
in
one
short
moment.
and
i
might
say
that
the
chaplains
of
the
(inaudible)
for
example
have
told
me
that
those
who
have
lived
to
face
absolute
life
sentences
after
their
death
sentences
were
commuted
have
in
all
cases
said
that
they
would
have
preferred
the
electric
chair.
and
we
suggest
that
those
persons
are
entitled
to
the
same
protection.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
would
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
--
i
would
say
in
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
that
of
course
there's
really
no
way
to
find
out.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
except
insofar
as
the
reports
generally,
maybe
relevant
to
the
question
of
the
seriousness
of
these
two
things,
even
if
we
cannot
believe
all
conducts
of
status.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
in
terms
of
acquitting
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
precisely.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it
may,
i
--
i
would
prefer
the
rest
it
actually,
in
terms
of
this
being
virtually
as
serious
as
a
death
sentence
with
a
difference
and
quality,
not
having
any
effect
on
what
a
fair
trial
is
going
to
be.
i
might
add
to
that,
that
--
that
i
for
one
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
a
trial
for
the
same
--
well,
let
--
let's
take
this
example,
suppose
that
a
person
who
is
tried
in
new
york
for
a
capital
--
for
murder,
a
capital
offense
and
he's
tried
without
counsel.
this
court
would
say
in
a
flash
that
was
not
a
fair
trial.
suppose
the
man
is
tried
on
exactly
the
same
state
of
facts
out
in
the
state
where
there
is
not
capital
punishment
and
the
man
is
tried
without
counsel.
at
this
stage,
the
court
might
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
--
want
to
examine
the
fact.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
if
you
had
the
exact
same
cases
in
two
jurisdictions,
where
this
court
has
to
look
at
the
essential
fairness
of
the
trial,
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
hold
that
the
trial
in
one
place
was
fair
and
not
fair
in
another
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
--
on
exactly
those
same
circumstances.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
i
think
so,
your
honor,
except
insofar
as
the
chance
is
maybe
absent
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
record
of
the
hearing
on
the
guilty
plea
in
the
trial
court
is
here
before
you.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
the
record
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the
--
actually
it
takes
up,
i
would
say
the
large
part
of
the
--
large
bulk
of
the
record.
it
begins
at
page
10
of
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
decision
of
that
court?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
i
think
we
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
only
factual
statement
--
i
don't
think
we
would
challenge
any
factual
statements,
your
honor,
though
i'm
not
sure
that
it
states
all
the
facts
that
there
are.
the
only
one
thing
which
we
would
--
i
want
to
come
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
we
contend
that
he
was
unable
to
make
his
own
defense
and
competent
to
that
particular
extent.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
there
was
none
whatsoever.
the
allegations
of
the
petition
were
denied.
i
understand
this
was
the
first
time
in
this
county
that
a
plea
was
even
asked
for
in
opposition.
the
--
our
opponents
take
the
position
that
there
need
not
have
been
a
hearing
because
they
had
denied
the
allegations
of
the
petition,
which
is
something
i
frankly
cannot
understand,
as
you
think
need
not
be
hearing
only
if
the
allegations
are
admitted
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
--
of
ones
that
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it
was,your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
we
say
he
wasn't
able
to
present
an
intelligently
without
counsel
having
been
given
to
him.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
he
had
some
defenses.
he
claims
first
of
all
innocence
upon
all
except
one
count.
there
were
other
items
for
example,
on
one
particular
offense
he
was
sentenced
to
the
defense
of
false
pretense.
he
was
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
for
a
particular
period
whereas
under
pennsylvania
law
he
could
not
have
been
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
this
particular
offense
or
given
the
type
of
sentence
he
had.
we
point
out
some
other
particular
prejudices
that
he
had.for
example
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
oh,
yes.
we
make
no
complaint
of
that
your
honor.
in
one
case
he
was
charge
with
the
commission
of
seven
forgeries
all
of
which
involved
the
signing
of
his
wife's
name
checks
written
on
her
account
and
on
it
by
the
bank.
any
lawyer
of
course
would
see
at
once
that
there
are
questions
in
there
as
to
whether
he
had
the
authority
to
sign
his
wife's
name,
whether
in
fact
anybody
was
actually
defrauded.he
might
well
have
been
enabled
by
--
if
his
wife
had
refused
to
take
the
stand
against
him
under
the
privilege
to
escape
conviction
on
this
charge.
he
might
have
been
able
to
convince
the
jury
that
he
had
her
authority
to
sign
this
particular
thing.
also,
the
commonwealth
offered
an
evidence
checks
supporting
six
of
the
seven
cases
but
on
one
of
this
counts
the
check
wasn't
produced
so
that
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
opportunity
for
the
prosecution
to
show
that
a
person
other
than
defendant's
wife
had
been
defrauded.
and
again
her
testimony
might
not
been
admissible.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
the
district
attorney's
office
had
raised
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
the
defense
of
latches
which
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
ignored.
the
records
don't
show
that,
i
would
say,
with
all
due
deference
to
my
colleague,
mrs.
matson
that
an
attorney
preparing
such
petition
should
prepare
that
one
would
not
allege
any
such
reasons
in
his
petition
because
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
that
would
be
relevant.
this
has
just
never
taken
any
part
and
took
in
--
of
consideration
in
these
cases.
had
there
been
any
inclination
to
go
into
that
sort
of
thing,
it
could
have
been
shown
at
the
hearing.
this
isn't
in
the
record
but
just
an
illustration
that
the
man
in
1949
tried
to
get
a
copy
of
the
court
records
which
was
denied
him
by
the
pennsylvania
court
that
he
tried
to
file
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
1952,
which
apparently
got
lost
in
the
courts.
and
finally,
mrs.
matson
prepared
another
petition
that
was
filed
in
1953.
so,
there
is
no
explanation
of
the
reasons
for
the
delay.
but
again
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
such
necessity.
and
the
courts
at
pennsylvania
never
inquired
into
that.
i
might
add
to
that,
your
honor,
that
since
we've
touched
on
latches
i
might
perhaps
mention
that
at
this
particular
point
although
i
was
hoping
to
hold
that
there
a
rebuttal.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
--
let
me
just
phrase
it
your
honor.
i
--
i
might
say
on
that
that
you
have
for
example
the
case
of
palmer
v.
ashe,
where
after
quite
of
a
few
more
years,
when
we
had
in
this
particular
case,
15
years
after
sentence,
the
man
brought
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict
on
habeas
corpus
and
it
was
granted.
and
there
was
a
decision
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
a
few
months
ago
not
cited
in
our
brief,
the
morgan
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
--
u.s.
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
pointed
out
that
time
could
not
possibly
cure
a
void
sentence.
and
that
the
least
that
of
state
or
federal
government
could
do
would
be
to
set
aside
the
particular
conviction
after
it
was
found
to
have
been
void,
that
there
was
no
way
of
restoring
the
time
that
a
man
had
spent
in
jail
on
a
particular
offense.
so
that
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
for
stating
that
the
delay
in
filing
the
habeas
corpus
is
any
reason
for
denying
it.
the
dissenters
in
palmer
v.
ashe
thought
that
the
factor
of
delay
plus
improbability
of
a
lot
of
other
allegations
and
failure
to
allege
a
lot
of
essential
points
that
all
of
those
states
take
it
together
might
have
been
ground
for
the
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
courts
and
after
justify
it
constitutionally.
that
of
course
was
the
view
of
the
dissenters.
and
i
might
say
that
even
with
some
members
of
this
court
inclined
to
follow
that
dissent
that
there
are
numerous
gestations
between
that
case
and
ours,
making
ours
a
fortiori
case.
the
example
on
that
case,
there
was
no
complexity
of
charges
that
the
uncounseled
defendant
had
to
face.
in
this
case
he
had
to.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
allegation
of
incompetency
to
conduct
the
man's
own
defense
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
dissenter
said
that
the
court
below
had
the
right
to
assume
competency
in
the
absence
of
a
contrary
allegation.
this
was
the
dissenters,
the
majority
said
no
even
to
that.
in
our
case,
there
was
an
allegation
of
incompetency
ti
conduct
the
trial.
and
this
allegation
was
denied,
that
there
was
no
denial
again
of
the
--
not
by
the
record
but
by
the
district
attorney
and
there
was
no
denial
here
of
the
right
that
the
man
did
not
know
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
also,
in
the
palmer
v.
ashe
case
the
man
involved
had
never
denied
committing
the
crimes
for
which
he
had
been
sentenced
whereas
in
this
case
before
you,
herman
has
denied
committing
all
of
the
crimes
for
which
he
was
sentenced
except
one.
and
i
think
perhaps
most
importantly
in
the
palmer
v.
ashe
case,
there
was
no
allegation
there
that
the
man
in
question
did
not
know
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
here,
we
have
an
allegation
that
herman
did
not
know
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
this
allegation
stands
uncontradicted,
even
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
may
i
--
may
i
quote,
mr.
justice
reed
on
that.
you
state
--
stated
as
follows.
the
record
shows
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
make
him
understand
the
consequences
of
this
plea.
again
here,
the
record
is
similarly
silent.
whatever
a
decision
might
have
been
if
the
trial
court
had
informed
him
of
his
rights
and
conscientiously
had
undertaken
to
perform
the
functions
ordinarily
entrusted
due
counsel,
we
conclude
that
the
opportunity
to
have
counsel
in
this
case
was
necessary
element
of
a
fair
hearing.
again
the
facts
in
uveges
and
the
facts,
not
particular
case,
i
think
don't
tell
quite
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
now,
there
was
actually
no
--
nothing
incorporated
as
i
remember
in
his
opinion
that
was
not
actually
a
part
of
the
record
except
insofar
as
it
related
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
pardon?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
i
believe
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
--
i'm
talking
not
about,
we're
talking
about
two
different
ones.
i'm
talking
about
our
case,
the
herman
case.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
there
was
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
that's
at
--
begins
at
page
18
of
the
record
here
and
that's
the
court
in
which
this
young
man
was
sentenced.
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
in
there
which
is
important
into
the
record
except
in
terms
of
what
happened
on
the
arraignment.that
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
and
we
would
state
that
of
course
therefore,
cannot
be
considered
by
this
court
because
it's
not
a
part
of
the
record
before
it.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
sir,
i
believe
that
in
this
various
pennsylvania
cases,
the
cert
writ
has
run
to
the
intermediate
appellate
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
this
i'm
afraid
i'm
really
incompetent
to
answer.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
157.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
what
i
--
i
think
your
honor
is
a
very
tough
problem
that
probably
would
not
arise
so
much
because
generally
when
you
have
this
multitude
in
these
indictments
and
you
find
that
the
sentences
are
substantially
more
than
any
person's
normal
life
expectancy.
i
would
say
that
actually
it
should
be
measured
in
terms
of
not
of
life
expectancy
so
much
but
in
terms
of
what
a
--
the
age
that
the
number
of
years
that
a
person
might
possibly
under
any
combination
of
circumstances
lived
to.
i
--
we
don't
know
exactly
how
that
might
be
pinpricked
out
in
future
cases.
i
doubt
that
it's
going
to
come
up
too
much
because
you
don't
have
so
much
indeterminate
sentencing.
it's
usually
either
the
chair
or
gas
chamber
or
life
imprisonment
period
without
possibility
of
parole.
i
don't
really
know
how
this
court
could
pinprick
it
out
except
perhaps
on
some
basis
of
actuarial
tables
of
what
a
man
might
face.
but
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
case
before
us
we
have
something
like
a
157
1/2
years
minimum
sentence
that
this
is
so
clear
as
to
admit
there's
no
dispute.
and
the
--
and
the
fashion
with
the
supreme
court
i
would
prefer
to
say
that
the
--
the
court
could
deal
with
that
problem
when
they
get
to
it.
although,
i
--
i
frankly
say
that
it
might
be
in
some
cases
difficulty
then.
but
again,
i
think,
that
that
would
clarify
the
edge
tremendously
for
the
number
of
cases
that
are
in
the
courts,
it
will
be
in
the
courts
in
the
future
and
in
which
--
which
might
given
off
the
good
guide
to
future
courts
faced
with
the
future
decisions.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
when
we
say
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
in
this
particular
--
if
they'll
all
run
concurrently.
i
don't
know
precisely
what
that
figure
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
that's
what
he
gave
him
17
1/2
years
but
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
no.
he
didn't
--
the
court
did
not
give
him
the
maximum
possible
sentence.
but
in
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
in
these
terms.
a
man
maybe
tried
for
murder,
a
capital
offense,
face
a
death
sentence
and
yet
it
may
well
be
that
he's
going
to
be
convicted
in
the
end
by
manslaughter
--
for
manslaughter
and
get
perhaps,
let's
say
a
two
year
sentence.
now,
under
such
circumstances
this
court
has
ruled
that
interstate
case,
it
is
the
potential
of
what
the
man
faces,
the
death
sentence
that
determines
whether
or
not
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
rather
than
the
particular
punishment
which
was
actually
made
it
out.
and
what
we
suggest
here
is
again
using
that
same
task
here.
the
potential
of
what
the
man
faced
again
is
sentence
of
157
1/2
years
to
350.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
any
one
offense,
i
would
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
20
--
20
years.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
again,
we
suggest
considering
it
on
a
maximum
basis
of
what
can
happen
to
this
particular
man.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
precisely,
your
honor.
i
would--
i
think
it
might
even
say
that
you
took
my
next
words
out
of
my
mouth.
actually,
the
case
is
really
as
close
a
case
to
uveges
and
the
person
could
possibly
get.
there's
been
now
attempt
to
distinguish
it
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
in
his
brief
whatsoever.
and
i
think
it
is
crystal
clear
that
under
the
uveges
and
under
the
various
other
decisions
that
this
case
requires
a
reversal.
i
don't
wish
to
take
up
time
going
into
all
the
nuances
of
these
opinions
unless
the
court
should
like
me
to.
that's
all
spelled
out
in
the
briefs
that
we
have
submitted
and
the
--
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions
i'd
like
to
turn
the
matter
over
to
my
colleague,
mrs.
matson.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
the
--
there
wasn't
any
hostility
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
we
make
no
contention
that
that
would
be
bargained
from
reaching
the
conclusion,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that
--
that
might
some
interesting
point
that
it
is
before
this
court
here.
habeas
corpus
is
usually
returnable
before
the
same
judge
which
bothers
me.
in
terms
of
hostility,
the
only
thing
we
can
point
to
is
--
and
i
don't
mean
like
i
can
stress
this
to
much
be
quite
honest.
comments
like
now,
you
want
the
court
to
have
mercy.
there
is
an
end
to
being
merciful.
we
did
this
in
1944.
and
then,
throws
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
court,
i'm
afraid
i
took
my
own
copy
of
the
transcript
here,
not
the
marked
one.
and
this
kind
of
sentence,
will
you
explain
by
the
court,
will
you
explain
to
me
why
the
court
should
extend
in
any
way
to
you.
now,
i
would
state
that
whereas
a
court
can
decide
this,
actually,
the
court
before
which
the
guilty
pleas
were
ended,
did
decide
the
matter
but
only
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
they
made
no
comments
actually.
the
court
made
no
comments,
importing
any
personal
observations
of
the
matter,
anything
at
that
sort.
they
decided
it
solely
on
that
basis
of
the
written
record
in
the
transcript
of
the
arraignment,
so
that
exactly
the
same
facts
are
here
for
this
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
--
i
might
say
no.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
you
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
it
--
it
would
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
a
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
oh,
i
think
actually
this
is
that
particular
case
where
the
trial
judge
has
looked
at
all
the
facts
and
has
announced
the
world
constitutional
doctrine
based
on
those
facts.
there
isn't
any
question
of
fact
that's
before
this
court
where
the
trial
judge
may
have
weighed
conflicting
claims.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
two
judges
have
done
what
we
considered
to
be
announced
wrong
decisions
on
the
constitution
based
on
facts.
as
pennsylvania
courts,
referring
to
uveges
and
there's
in
other
cases.
i
might
say
that
in
uveges
also,
when
you
had
exactly
the
same
sort
of
situation
as
you
had
here,
i
believe,
that
is
also
a
case
brought
before
the
same
judge
who
would
handle
the
matter.
and
again,
i
think,
that
this
court
has
never
hesitated
to
scrutinize
records
of
anew
when
cases
come
up
here
for
constitutional
points
that
are
myriad
with
decisions
on
that.
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
all
i'm
thinking,
justice
frankfurter
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
pardon?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
you
don't
sit
here,
de
novo
but
you
do
examine
the
facts
of
new
with
careful
scrutiny.
this
has
happened
in
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
--
i
would
your
honor,
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
but
i
think
this
court
has.
for
example
in
confession
cases,
scrutinized
the
record
very
carefully
and
even
upset
convictions
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that,
i
think,
is
a
very
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that
--
that's
precise.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
thank
you.
thank
you
for
the
clarification.
i
was
asked
before,
i
--
i
do
want
to
close
and
give
mrs.
matson
an
opportunity,
but
i
was
asked
before
whether
we
contend
that
a
person
has
an
absolute
right
in
every
state
criminal
case
to
have
counsel.
we
don't
contend
that,
your
honor,
but
what
we
do
contend
is
that
a
person
in
every
state
criminal
case
should
have
the
right
to
be
told
of
his
right
to
counsel,
to
whatever
extent
that
maybe.
we
so
read
bute
v.
illinois,
since
that
was
actually
the
narrow
issue
that
was
presented
by
the
pleadings.
the
court
in
watts
and
turner
and
harris,
that
were
the
three
cases,
indicated
that
the
failure
to
advise
a
defendant
of
his
right
to
counsel
was
one
element
in
the
picture.
and
we
take
that
this
would
be
something
a
rule
that
could
be
applied
as
a
thumb
and
that
is
a
valid
rule
under
the
past
decisions
of
this
court.
but
again
we
--
we
do
want
to
stress
that
this
court
made
no
--
go
no
further
actually,
if
it
want
--
if
it
wants
to
handle
this
case
very
simply
and
to
right
per
curiam
uveges
v.
pennsylvania.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
pennsylvania
law
is
that
the
assistance
of
counsel
is
required
solely
in
capital
cases.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
am
i
correct
on
that?
i
--
i
would
prefer
if
mrs.
matson
could
argue
that.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
she's
(inaudible)
pennsylvanian.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
she
could
answer
that
one
too.
