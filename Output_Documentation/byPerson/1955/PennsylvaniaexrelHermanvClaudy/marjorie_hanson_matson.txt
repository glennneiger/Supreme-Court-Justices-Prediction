ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
if
the
court
please.
since
this
question
of
pennsylvania
law
on
right
to
counsel
in
noncapital
cases
is
currently
before
us,
i'll
start
with
just
a
moment
on
that.
our
appellate
courts,
both
the
superior
and
supreme
court
have
held
that
rather
there's
no
absolute
right
to
counsel
in
pennsylvania
in
noncapital
cases.
if
there
are
any
special
circumstances
in
which
ingredients
of
unfairness
appear,
then
the
person
has
a
right
to
have
counsel.
and
in
several
cases,
that
principle
has
--
has
been
applied
and
there
has
been
found
to
be
a
denial
of
the
right
of
counsel.
on
this
other
point
before
you,
this
is
not
the
principle
point
because
it
becomes
important
only
as
it
ties
in
with
the
question
of
the
denial
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
taking
of
the
plea.
that
if
in
the
point
which
have
raise
is
in
reference
to
the
way
in
which
this
defendant
was
handled
from
the
very
moment
that
he
was
taken
into
custody.
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
alleges
and
it
is
not
denied,
that
he
was
held
incommunicado
for
72
hours.
when
it
came
to
the
allegations
of
the
physical
abuse
or
threats
to
himself
and
directed
against
his
wife
and
child,
the
district
attorney's
office
denied
that.
their
denial
of
course
cannot
under
the
decision
in
this
case
be
given
any
particular
effect
because
the
court
announced
the
pennsylvania
rule
very
clearly
here
in
its
opinion
when
it
said
that,
"if
there
has
been
no
hearing
then
any
allegation
properly
pleaded
in
the
petition
not
be
accepted
as
true."
to
see
a
great
deal
of
--
of
this
problem
would
have
been
removed
here
and
we
might
not
be
here
before
you
if
the
lower
court
has
seen
fit
to
grant
a
hearing
in
this
case.
but
i
think
that
you
will
perhaps
understand
why
we
didn't
get
a
hearing
when
i
refer
to
some
of
the
time
element
involved
here.
our
petition
was
filed
on
april
to
30th
of
1953.
it
was
not
until
june
16,
that
the
court
saw
fit
to
issue
a
rule
to
show
cause
and
to
require
an
answer
to
be
filed.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
april
--
april
the
30th.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
and
the
rule
was
granted
in
june.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
and
an
answer
was
filed
by
the
district
attorney's
office
in
august
of
that
year.
and
then
we
waited
for
a
hearing
to
be
set
and
nothing
happened.
and
finally,
without
even
an
opportunity
for
oral
argument
which
was
the
very
most
clear
cut
violation
of
pennsylvania
practice.
the
judge
decided
this
case
and
failed
to
notify
me.
this
is
--
is
in
the
record
but
it
was
18
days
after
he
decided
the
case
that
they
saw
fit
to
give
us
any
notice
of
that.
then
we
took
our
appeal
to
the
superior
court
at
which
time
the
--
the
notary's
office
of
washington
county,
refused
to
accept
the
writ
from
the
pennsylvania
superior
court,
they
returned
it.
this
was
a
rather
peculiar
thing
but
the
washington
county
has
a
rule
of
court,
which
says
that
the
name
of
local
counsel
must
be
endorsed
on
every
paper
filed
in
their
court.
and
local
counsel's
name
was
not
endorsed
upon
the
writ
of
the
superior
court,
so
they
sent
it
back.
it
required
an
order
from
the
judge
in
washington
county
to
get
this
on
notary
to
accept
the
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
and
transmit
a
record
and
--
and
that
is
referred
to
here
in
the
record
and
not
the
printed
record
on
there.
with
this
kind
of
an
attitude
in
the
lower
court,
you
can
see
the
practical
problems
which
we
confronted
and
which
are
confronted
by
many
people
down
in
washington
county,
which
happens
to
have
a
--
a
very
bad
record
in
--
in
respect
to
this.
they
have
a
great
many
cases
before
the
superior
court
involving
very
similar
situations
to
that.
now
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
here,
with
stephen
herman,
who
was
picked
up,
held
incommunicado
question
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
the
rule
would
have
--
have
required
their
application
and
i
suppose
we
could
have
moved
to
strike
the
pleading
on
the
ground
if
it
not
being
verified.perhaps,
mr.
zelt
will
be
able
to
give
some
explanation
as
to
why
it
was
not.
but
--
since
no
hearing
was
granted,
you
see,
it
becomes
more
or
less
immaterial
because
the
denial
don't
count
anyway
under
pennsylvania
law.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
go
quite
that
far,
i
think,
that
it
could
have
been
stricken
off
for
not
being
verified.
but
since
it
was
not,
i
think
we
can
say
that
just
if
it
had
been
so
far
as
this
court
is
concern.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
yes,
your
honor.
we
rely
upon
the
following
things
as
evidence
of
ingredient
of
--
of
unfairness
entering
into
the
process.
in
the
first
place,
like
this
man
was
only
21-years
of
age.
he
had
had
only
six
years
of
formal
education.
he
had
only
been
in
trouble
once
before
at
which
time
he
did
not
have
counsel,
it
was
not
a
trial.
it
was
a
plea
entered
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
this
one
was
entered
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
he
alleged
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
his
right
to
--
to
have
counsel.
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
what
he
should
do
when
he
got
up
there
in
the
courtroom
having
previously
signed
of
what
was
called
a
"waiver
of
grand
jury"
agreeing
to
plea
--
plead
to
three
offenses.
this
was
in
fact
at
which
he
desperately
needed
counsel
because
he
was
suddenly
confronted
with
eight
indictments
containing
27
counts.
he
was
not
permitted
to
--
to
read
these
things
or
have
been
explained
to
him,
first
he
signed.
then
he
was
brought
up
before
the
court.
and
this
is
the
normal
practice
and
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
that
in
the
way
it
is
handled.
that
is
the
plea
was
signed
right
there
in
the
courtroom
probably
while
another
case
was
going
on
and
that
then,
the
defendant
having
signed
would
be
brought
before
the
bench
to
--
to
be
disposed
of.
in
addition
to
these
factors,
the
fact
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
sign
this
confession
back
on
september
the
8th
after
three
--
after
72
hours
of
being
held
incommunicado
and
questioned,
and
assaulted,
and
threatened.
if
--
if
herman
had
been
able
to
handle
this
situation
if
he'd
had
counsel,
he
would
have
known
at
the
point
when
he
got
up
there
and
found
that
he
had
entered
a
plea
to
27
different
offenses.
that
this
was
the
time
to
say,
"no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
do
these
things.
i
only
did
one
of
them
and
i
pled
guilty
only
because
i
signed
the
waiver
rather
in
the
confession
because
i
was
threatened
and
abused
and
mistreated."
but
he
would
have
had
to
--
to
take
that
step
there
in
the
courtroom
with
state
police
officer
james
wright
at
his
right
hand
with
a
judge
who
was
obviously
angry
over
his
being
in
there
a
second
time,
under
circumstances
where
very
few
people
of
even
superior
intelligence
would
have
enough
courage
to
get
up
and
say,
"everybody
in
this
courtroom
except
me
is
wrong
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
judge
before
you
send
me
away."
well,
of
course
herman
didn't
do
that.
the
fact
that
once
he
had
--
had
entered
his
plea
that
he
was
taken
advantage
of
by
the
court
and
--
and
this
is
a
very
serious
charge
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
things
which
we
have
pointed
out
indicate
that.
the
fact
that
the
judge
who
had
before
him
the
record
showing
he
had
agreed
to
plea
to
three
offenses
then
to
sentence
him
on
27
offenses.
why
--
why
shouldn't
this
judge
have
inquired
as
to
this
sudden
multiplication
of
charges
from
--
from
three
up
to
27?
this
was
something
which
put
the
court
on
--
on
inquiry,
it
seems
to
me,
and
the
court
failed
to
--
to
make
an
inquiry
and
sentenced
him
on
cases
where
it
was
obvious
that
no
case
could
have
been
made
out
if
this
man
had
been
put
to
trial.
so
that
all
of
these
things
constitute
the
ingredients
of
unfairness.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
there
was
burglary
that
was
in
20
years.
he
--
he
couldn't
have
--
he
could
have
given
him
a
longer
sentence
than
he
gave
on
--
in
this
case
because
burglary
is
20
years
in
pennsylvania
and
that
just
--
would
be
more
than
a
17
1/2.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
to
have
been
sentenced
on
all
of
these
different
term
counts?
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
yes.
if
--
if
a
sentence
is
--
is
wrongly
imposed,
even
if
it
had
no
additional
time
to
the
time
that
you
have
to
serve,
you
have
a
right
to
--
to
relate
against
it.
we
have
superior
court
decisions
squarely
on
that
point.
here,
this
--
this
judge
here
even
sentenced
him
to
the
penitentiary
for
an
attempt
which
--
on
which
that
is
not
permitted,
gave
him
an
indeterminate
sentence
before
pretense
which
is
--
is
not
permitted
on
defense
because
no
lawyer
wasn't
at
that
time
and
now
we
have
set
all
of
these
things
were
the
ingredients
of
unfairness.
i
should
like
to
save
our
remaining
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
--
five
minutes
of
time.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
i
believe
that
is
denied,
yes.
but
i
say,
it's
not
in
the
record.
of
course,
this
kind
of
thing
would
never
be
in
the
record
obviously.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
i
had
hoped
to
but
we
sort
of
got
side
tracked
on
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
--
these
other
points,
sir.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
we
--
i
--
i
have
about
five
minutes,
i'll
be
glad
to
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
let
me
tell
you
this,
that
your
honors
that
on
the
matter
of
the
coerced
confessions,
it
was
--
it
had
been
very
disturbing
to
some
of
us
in
pennsylvania
who
are
interested
in
civil
liberty,
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
don't
like
the
decisions
of
--
of
this
court
in
the
watt,
turner,
and
harris
cases.and
whenever
they
come
up
in
--
in
any
pennsylvania
case
it
is
the
dissenting
opinion
which
is
referred
to.
the
superior
court
which
handles
most
of
these
cases
because
appeal
in
habeas
corpus
go
to
the
superior
court
and
you
almost
never
are
able
to
get
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
to
allow
(inaudible)
so
that
essentially,
the
superior
court
is
the
court
of
last
resort
and
the
one
that
passes
on
--
on
these
things.
and
they
have
said
whatever
may
be
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
turner
(inaudible),
we
are
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
now,
that
was
their
language,
it's
quoted
in
our
brief.
and
they
then
proceed
in
--
in
most
of
the
situations
which
has
arisen
to
deny
that
holding,
a
part
from
incommunicado
for
as
long
as
15
days
has
anything
to
do
with
rather
the
confession
was
voluntary
or
not.
and
they
have
--
have
in
effect
ignored
the
requirements
of
the
decision
in
this
respect.
now,
it
isn't
vital
to
the
decision
of
the
herman
case,
that
your
honors
look
into
that
point
at
all
except
that
it
may
have
some
bearing
upon
whether
there
shouldn't
have
been
a
hearing
here
to
determine
what
the
facts
really
were.
but
it
is
present
in
pennsylvania
decisions
and
perhaps,
they
ought
to
have
a
little
bit
more
respect
for
the
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
your
honor,
as
we
have
outlined
this
argument
in
the
briefs
so
that
it
is
before
you
and
i'm
sorry
that
we
don't
have
time
to
go
into
it
further
at
this
time.
thank
you.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
i
wanted
to
have
it
be
perfectly
clear
on
this
matter
of
the
72-hour
detention
that
that
occurred
prior
to
september
the
8th.
this
is
our
position
here
that
we
we're
detained
for
72
hours
before
the
signing
of
the
--
of
the
waiver
of
which
was
on
the
same
day
as
the
hearing
before
the
alderman.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
district
attorney's
office
did
not
deny
that.
their
answer
here
says,
it
is
denied
that
the
delay
towards
constitutional
rights
were
denied
because
he
was
arrested
and
confined
for
a
period
of
72
hours.
this
is
not
an
unreasonable
length
of
time.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
there
check
probably
showed
that
he
actually
had
been
in
there
for
72
hours
before
the
september
8th
information
were
filed
and
that
that's
why
they
deny
--
didn't
deny
it.at
any
rate
it
wasn't
denied.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
that
was
a
month
and
half
later.
it
was
six
weeks
and
it
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
your
honor
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
--
there
he
was
having
signed
pleas
being
before
the
court
feeling
bound
down
by
the
confession
which
he
had
given.
and
certainly,
feeling
bound
by
the
papers
which
he
had
signed
there
in
open
court
and
what
was
he
was
going
to
say
when
a
judge
said,
"did
you
do
these
things?"
at
that
point,
his
only
answer
must
have
been
yes,
unless,
of
course
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
--
he
had
had
the
courage
to
stand
and
up
and
say,
"no.
i
didn't
do
any
of
these
things,
i
said
i
did
because
i
was
beaten.”
and
i
don't
think
you
can
accept
a
defendant
an
uncounseled
defendant
to
--
to
do
that.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
the
only
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
well,
you
your
honor
this
man
stood
up
there
before
the
--
the
judge.
he
had
just
been
told
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
charge
of
the
place,
"sign
your
name
and
forget
it."
is
he
then,
when
the
judge
says
that
--
that
and
you
have
committed
this
numerous
offenses,
is
he
to
--
at
that
point
suddenly
make
resistance,
this
--
this
is
expecting
too
much
of
him.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
just
--
just
this.
mr.
zelt
suggested
that
maybe
this
problem
could
be
cured
by
statute.
a
statute
as
already
been
passed.
the
act
of
1951
in
pennsylvania
provides
definitely
that
there
shall
be
a
hearing
when
a
rule
has
issued.
it's
--
it's
absolutely
clear
so
with
the
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
commonwealth,
ex
rel.
elliott
versus
baldi
of
1953
case
and
yet
the
rights
were
flagrantly
violated.
we
don't
need
--
need
a
statute,
we
have
one.
we
just
need
someone
to
pay
some
attention
to
--
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
i
don't
believe
there
is.
ms.
marjorie
hanson
matson
it's
the
act
of
may
25th
1951,
p.
l.
415,
sections
4
and
