justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
statement
of
facts,
you're
not
going
give
us
anything
except
that
is
beyond
dispute,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
think
--
you
think
that
kind
of
a
question
--
that
kind
of
--
on
here,
that's
frequent,
i'd
rather
go
to
the
chair
than
get
a
life
sentence
or
judges
say
that,
a
lawyer
say
that.
do
you
think
that
kind
of
a
subject
or
statement
is
worth
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
anything
only
formality's
act,
that
they
now
go
to
the
electric
chair
because
they
could
--
they
didn't
think
to
--
because
i
want
to
go
to
the
electric
chair.
that
adds
validity
to
then
march
into
the
electric
chair
but
all
the
speculative
things
as
to
whether
a
life
sentence
is
better
than
or
worst
appears
to
be
not
worth
of
much
of
an
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
cut
your
argument
but
it
does
touch
the
support
in
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
precisely,
that's
why
it
shouldn't
be
pressed
as
an
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
serious
business
in
the
lights
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
addressing
myself
to
this
psychological
speculation
that
seems
to
me
to
becloud
the
actions
here
and
sort
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
had
that
firstly.
michigan
has
no
capital.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
man
who
still
lives
has
a
chance
to
get
out
and
the
man
who
still
had
no
chance
to
get
out.
that
seems
to
be
a
cardinal
distinction,
not
with
reference
to
your
point,
but
a
reference
to
the
argument,
that
i'd
rather
be
dead
than
be
alive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy,
since
we're
talking
about
what
--
what
court
decided
what,
may
i
ask
about
a
--
a
procedural
point
that
irrelevant
to
the
merit
of
this
case.
that's
how
i
asked
the
district
attorney,
the
attorney
general
since
you're
not
a
pennsylvanian
lawyer.
but
why
is
this
writ
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
commonwealth
rather
than
to
the
--
what
court
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
superior
court
is
all
that
the
supreme
court
did
is
to
disallow
an
appeal
which
i
take
it
on
something
to
correction,
which
i
take
it
just
like
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
that
is
not
in
the
adjudication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
has,
i'm
asking
why
it
should?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i'd
ask
pennsylvania
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you've
stated
it
--
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you've
stated
it,
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
sit
here
de
novo
even
in
constitutional
statements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
approve
to
that
statement.
this
court
has
never
so
decided
as
you
have
said
that
it
would
not
allow
a
lower
court
by
claiming
a
finding
of
fact
to
conclude
an
inquiry
in
your
constitutional
claims.
we're
not
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
statement
which
is
a
very
important
one,
it's
very
easy
to
slip
from
your
statement
to
--
assuming
that
in
a
murder
case,
when
we
sit
back
under
your
court
of
appeals,
we
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means
except
unless
you
stated
as
a
legal
proposition
to
that
important
thing,
namely,
it
will
not
be
foreclosed
by
the
finding
of
a
state
court
that
a
state
of
facts
constitutes
a
voluntary
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
something.
your
statement
means
the
vagueness
and
ambiguity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
what
the
law
of
pennsylvania
wholly
apart
from
the
requirement
of
our
decisions,
the
(inaudible)
what
is
pennsylvania
law
as
to
the
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
no
other
cases
no
matter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
thought
she
was
arguing
for
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
yes.
but
i
thought
she
spent
arguing
in
other
courts,
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
isn't
that
--
before
you
sit
down,
aren't
you
proposing
to
argue
anymore
than
with
this
statement,
the
question
of
coerced
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me,
speak
for
myself
too
important
to
allow
yourself
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
leave
it
to
you,
but
unless
you
--
i
should
think
you'd
have
to
do,
your
counsel
report,
do
you
have
it
with
--
on
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
may
i
say
that
in
respect
to
the
pennsylvania
courts,
i
merely
give
a
respect
to
venues
but
--
but
if
the
situation
is
as
you've
stated,
it
seems
to
be
ought
to
be
more
important
on
the
difficulty
that
it
involves,
press
the
point
of
this
court.
and
so,
in
the
nature
of
things,
it
isn't
our
duty
to
pay
respect
to
their
decisions.
i
suppose
the
relationship
together
may
rhyme.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on
to
that,
mr.
district
attorney,
how
much
--
how
much
of
a
burden
on
your
--
might
have
tried
in
the
courts,
what
--
would
it
be
if
in
a
--
in
these
--
in
a
case
like
this,
instead
of
dismissing
out
of
hand,
an
experienced
questioning
judge
should
give
a
hearing
and
put
these
things
on
record
as
part
of
the
court,
would
really
know
the
facts
as
chief
of
the
forum
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
how
much
of
a
burden
would
that
be
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
pennsylvania
for
the
matter
to
be
dealt
within
that
way
instead
of
leading
into
this
argumentative
consideration,
depending
on
what
you
can
and
cannot
about
different
people
with
different
(inaudible)
occupation
infer
or
do
not
infer
of
the
dead
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
if
i
may,
that
this,
your
local
procedure,
what
type
of
it.
it
would
say,
and
--
and
the
decisions
would
rest
on
record
that
then
would
be
--
would
create
no
difficulty
here
with
difference
of
opinion.
it
would
take
this
on
appeal
into
the
federal
courts
even
by
way
of
habeas
corpus,
is
that
plenty
in
your
commonwealth
as
we
--
as
i
know
or
directly
from
the
proceedings
of
the
state
courts.
shortcuts
in
these
matters
are
sometimes
not
shortcuts
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
side
of
if
it
is
--
the
other
side
of
this
one
reversal
in
this
court
would
stimulate
hundreds
of
a
habeas
corpuses
in
your
state
courts
and
federal
court.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
a
fellow
--
every
fellow
takes
his
case
as
good
as
the
fellow
whose
case
is
reversed,
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
zelt,
may
i
ask
you
this?
what
line
of
pennsylvania
(inaudible)
as
misdemeanor,
is
that
here?
is
that
the
length
of
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
would
you
turn
to
make
my
question
to
your
practicality.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
your
--
in
your
experience
as
district
attorney,
of
the
seriousness,
it's
usually
called
it
felony,
serious
offenses
to
be
prosecuted.
in
what
percentages
of
the
three
was
guilty
as
against
going
to
trial,
this
doesn't
draw
--
draft
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it
will
shock
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
freed
of
guilty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think,
if
you
think
it
will
shock
the
court,
that's
--
they
--
they
run
by
that
from
1885
to
1895
in
--
in
pennsylvania.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
--
what
is
your
trial
law
with
serious
offense
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
washington,
a
county
of
a
population
around
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say
a
word
before
you
sit
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
the
expiration
part
of
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
our
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
a
word,
before
you
sit
down,
about
the
ground
that
they
last
urged
namely
that
the
confession
was
coerced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
reference
to
that
statute
in
you
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
reference
to
that
statute
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
give
me
--
just
give
me
the
year
and
i'll
look
it
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
25th,
you
said,
that
you're
raising
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
