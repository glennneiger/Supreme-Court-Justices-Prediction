justice
frankfurter
can
they
say,
your
suggestion
is
that
you
can
petition
that
for
habeas
corpus
on
ground
a
and
if
you're
sold
out
on
that
the
next
day
you
begin
another
habeas
corpus
on
ground
b
and
so
on.
justice
frankfurter
you
can
do
it
in
england
today
and
add
in
tonight.
justice
frankfurter
have
we
in
this
record
the
pleading,
the
proceedings
of
the
very
prior
habeas
corpus.
justice
frankfurter
they're
in
the
record.
justice
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
by
just
examining
a
careful
reading
of
it
--
of
the
petition
and
the
trial
as
far
as
we
can
tell
whether
the
ground
now
urged
had
been
previously
urged.
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that's
very
material
to
this
point
is
it?
justice
frankfurter
is
that
by
statute
or
by
local
practice?
justice
frankfurter
would
you
say
impliedly
and,
of
course,
can't
stay
on
the
basis,
that
there's
nothing
to
it.
we
must
see
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
yes.
justice
frankfurter
without
a
hearing
(voice
overlap)
justice
frankfurter
that
your
ultimate
position
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
florida,
in
a
particular
incident
is
barred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
discouraging
or
is
barred
from
having
a
policy
whereby
taking
three
animals
by
one
(inaudible)
act
must
be
dealt
with
as
though
it
were
a
single
offense
and
not
involve
punishment
for
each
animal
separately.
is
that
your
ultimate
position?
justice
frankfurter
what
is
your
ultimate
position?
justice
frankfurter
you
mean
there
are
prior
to
decisions
which
have
held
that
if
you
take
a
--
a
cow,
a
bull
and
a
heifer
all
at
once,
like
two
people
together,
that
is
just
one
offense?
justice
frankfurter
i'll
put
to
you,
that's
a
different
case
in
the
brief
before
us.
i'll
put
it
to
you.
there's
one
thing
to
say
whether
at
once
grabbing
of
three
animals
in
the
state
be
fit
to
prosecute
only
for
one
that
that
would
have
chosen
that
mode
to
prosecute
that
transaction,
but
that
i
do
not
necessarily
draw
from
that
conclusion,
the
state
can
say
it
may
have
contemporaneously
and
that
they're
all
(inaudible)
on
all
of
them.
justice
frankfurter
you've
got
to
say
that's
a
cruel,
unusual
punishment
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
through
the
district
court.
justice
frankfurter
and
--
and
that's
one
thing.
justice
frankfurter
it
is
the
only
--
must
be
--
justice
frankfurter
what
you're
--
what
you're
arguing
then
is
that
here
is
the
general
rule,
uncontested,
for
the
reason
of
the
uncontested
doctrine
of
criminal
law
in
florida,
and
in
the
case
of
this
person,
they
made
an
exception.
justice
frankfurter
and
--
and
that
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
frankfurter
i
suggest
to
give
you
another
distinction.
this
is
a
decision
of
1951
the
apparent
year
was
in
1949,
as
i
understand
it.
florida
may
change
its
mind.
that
should
be
1949
and
1951.
justice
frankfurter
well
that's
--
that's
was
fiction
that
they
usually
discuss.
justice
frankfurter
they've
wanted
a
fiction
that
whether
it
was
decided
in
1951
or
whether
it
was
decided
in
1930
or
1940
or
1949.
justice
frankfurter
well,
it
will
imply
irrational
arbitrarily
the
rest
it
will.
it
will
happen
later
with
you.
you
must
allow
the
court
also
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
be
getting
better
that
offended
any
provision
of
the
federal
constitution,
would
you?
justice
frankfurter
you
know
there
are
decisions
in
this
court
that
one
cannot
be
too
excited
about
which
allows
separate
punishment
for
ingredients
of
what
might
deemed
a
single
transaction.
justice
frankfurter
they're
not
conclusions
of
law,
now
it
is.
justice
frankfurter
that's
what
should
be
more
brilliantly
considered.
justice
frankfurter
but
--
but
a
statement
that
it
was
just
one
transaction
is
hardly
an
allegation
of
fact.
justice
frankfurter
those
are
allegations
of
fact.
justice
frankfurter
but
it
might
have
to
be
--
it
takes
ten
$1
bills
constitutionally?
justice
frankfurter
constitutionally,
he
has
to
pay.
he
may
make
a
separate
offense
taking
10
separate
dollars
--
justice
frankfurter
or
it
may
make
--
punishable
more
severely
taking
$10
than
$1?
justice
frankfurter
you
may
take
your
point.
you
say
it
hasn't
done
so,
they've
done
the
opposite
you've
discriminated
in
punishment
against
this
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
that's
okay.
justice
frankfurter
mr.
rutledge,
may
i
ask
you
this?
i
noticed
that
the
hearn
case
was
decided
by
a
divided
court.
what
i
would
like
to
know
just
about
three
years
--
a
little
over
three
years,
three
years,
two
months
-
after
they
denied
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
district.
i
wonder
if
you
could
tell
me
whether
the
make-up
of
that
value
of
hearn
had
changed
from
the
court
or
membership
of
the
court
which
denied
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
this
case
(inaudible)
the
name.
you
probably
have
that
in
mind.
that
isn't
even
decided
to
turn
the
way
you
indicated,
you
stated
correctly.
but
i
didn't
think
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
yes.
justice
frankfurter
hudson.
justice
frankfurter
(inaudible)
chapman
and
mathews,
as
i
remember
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
frankfurter
no,
not
the
three
--
the
three
are
all
gone.
justice
frankfurter
chapman.
justice
frankfurter
now,
that
--
now,
that
this
(inaudible)
as
well
as
it
were,
here
unanimously
prove
it
the
decision
now
(inaudible)
in
that
case,
i
think
it
was
not
an
unknown
decision
for
the
florida
court.
justice
frankfurter
that'd
be
a
fair
assumption.
justice
frankfurter
that's
important.
it
isn't
a
question
whether
it
should
bound
him,
but
it's
a
question
whether
it
may.
justice
frankfurter
that's
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
trouble
you?
justice
frankfurter
to
(inaudible)
where
that
and
particularly
would
you
just
summarize
where
i'd
find
those
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
alright.
justice
frankfurter
that's
1949.
justice
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
frankfurter
you're
suggesting
that
new
york
is
not
to
expect
less
from
a
lawyer
than
from
a
layman,
is
that
it?
justice
frankfurter
mr.
bowen,
i
thought
that
an
act
of
one
has
a
difference
about
procedure
(inaudible)
not
his
own.
i
thought
that
under
coram
nobis,
coram
nobis
is
the
most,
it
would
be
the
most
to
relieve
in
the
mooney
against
holohan
situation.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you
this
to
see
if
i
understand
you.
your
argument
which
is
(inaudible)
that
for
all
i
want
to
know,
this
was
not
a
single
revenue
--
single
revenue.
and
for
all
i
know,
that
would
depend
upon
the
testimony
of
the
trial
in
what
was
before
(inaudible)
if
in
fact
--
if
in
fact,
it
wasn't
all
in
one
transaction
like
the
hearn
transaction,
that
was
proper
--
a
proper
basis
for
taking
an
appeal.
and
that
is
by
another
decision
that
we've
got
in
hearn
--
in
the
hearn
case.
that
was
not
done.
later
on,
i
know
there
was
an
affidavit
which
would
--
did
set
forth
that
it
was
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
now
you
--
justice
frankfurter
that's
what
the
--
this
is
what
i
heard
you
say
that
in
1952,
they
appended
their
own
affidavit.
justice
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
frankfurter
there
was
an
affidavit
lately
that
--
that
what
i
would
regard
an
allegation
of
facts
and
not
a
clear
inference
of
law.
that
this
was
all
done
in
one
--
in
one
--
as
one
thing
and
one
event.
that's
true,
isn't
it,
the
allegation?
justice
frankfurter
now,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
allegation
in
1949
and
in
1952
is
not
--
need
not
had
been
practiced
--
need
not
have
been
contradicted,
did
not
raise
the
status
of
the
issue
because
that
issue
was
in
the
case
in
the
original
trial
but
it
was
sought
to
be
raised
and
it
should
have
been
raised
on
appeal.
is
that
your
position?
justice
frankfurter
there
were
six
but
it
shows
that
only
while
we
have
the
record
here
--
justice
frankfurter
in
that,
there
were
six
sentences.
justice
frankfurter
--
but
that
how
that
might
go
wrong.
justice
frankfurter
well,
he
may
have
--
he
may
have
thought
there's
all
in
all
six
categories,
hence,
it
would
take
you
at
the
same
time
each
constituted
a
separate
sentence
of
both
on
the
--
use
that
word,
offense.
justice
frankfurter
very
well.
now,
assume
he
made
that
mistake.
it
is
your
argument,
the
time
and
the
knowledge
it
showed
him
was
on
appeal
and
not
subject
of
an
appeal
--
justice
frankfurter
--
by
habeas
corpus
or
of
coram
nobis,
is
that
it?
justice
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
if
at
any
stage
of
this
--
if
any
of
the
proceedings
after
he's
convicted
that
any
of
his
effort
to
be
relieved
from
consequence
of
any
conviction,
state
as
a
ground
that
he
pretty
have
a
fair
trial
and
that
he
wasn't
properly
--
wasn't
--
did
not
--
because
he's
capable
of
this
properly
defenses.
justice
frankfurter
and
they're
anywhere?
justice
frankfurter
to
what
extent
are
juries
waived
in
a
jury
if
criminal
cases
have
been
filed?
justice
frankfurter
it
isn't
relevant
to
--
but
--
but
it's
not
without
a
moving
interest?
justice
frankfurter
it
is
not
relevant
through
our
immediate
problem,
but
it's
not
without
a
nomination
that
you
are
free
to
tell
it
-
why
the
difference?
why
do
they
raise
in
miami
and
not
in
jacksonville?
justice
frankfurter
and
it's
the
same
condition
hold
in
--
in
the
rural
county
in
florida?
but
that
rule
--
justice
frankfurter
no,
it's
about
waiving,
they
don't
do
nothing.
justice
frankfurter
but
not
--
not
preponderance.
justice
frankfurter
not
predominantly
but
not
--
justice
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this,
i
want
to
make
sure
exactly
what
it
is
that
you
(inaudible)
do
i
understand
you
to
suggest
that
if
this
case
on
the
record
we
now
have,
that
he
didn't
claim,
had
come
up
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
appeal
from
the
conviction,
that
court
would
have
found
the
error
and
made
revision
of
the
sentence.
justice
frankfurter
yes,
but
do
we
know
if
the
record
would
have
told
you?
justice
frankfurter
(inaudible)
property
that
if
the
allegation,
would
you
say
were
not
permanent
because
they
were
not
(inaudible)
had
been
substantiated
at
the
trial,
then
that
leads
on
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
you're
saying
that
the
--
the
only
-
the
only
thing
that
we
could
infer
from
your
question
this
argument
of
yours,
not
that
we
can
say
if
we
have
taken
an
appeal
that
doesn't
--
that
would
have
to
impede
except
that
it
was
illegal.
justice
frankfurter
but
that
if
the
record
had
revealed
the
fact
that
they're
now
claiming
was
an
affidavit,
then
he
would
have
--
justice
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
frankfurter
you
cannot
say
on
this
record,
that's
your
position.
that
merely
because
he
didn't
take
an
appeal
to
be
serving
30
years
maybe
instead
of
10.
