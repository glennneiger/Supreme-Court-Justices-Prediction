black
you
have
citation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
they
could
do
that
if
it's
a
question
we
have
to
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
doesn't
solve
your
problem,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
--
if
this
statute
was
valid,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
so
far
as
the
argument
is
heard.
whether
this
murder
has
been
committed
during
the
first
world
war
and
the
second
world
war.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
statute
of
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
this
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
crime
committed
during
the
first
or
second
world
war,
the
provision
is
that
the
government,
as
counsel,
call
the
man
before
the
court-martial
and
try
him
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that's
a
pleasant
way
for
making
a
(inaudible)
provides
the
bill
of
rights,
a
trial
by
jury,
indictment
by
attorney,
with
the
exception
of
whatever
extended
goal
for
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
military
court.
so
what
effect
did
they
held
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
because
i
would
like
to
have
you
discuss
this
from
your
statement
(inaudible)
do
you
have
a
provision
that
authorizes
(inaudible)
and
lend
possible
argument
to
the
provisions
you
take?
i
--
i
do
not
take,
do
you
not
in
certainly
landing
a
possible
argument
in
the
position
you're
asking
this
question.
i
take
in
turn
that
i
couldn't
be
able
to
do
it
because
it
said,
in
the
time
--
on
the
time
they
are
made
(inaudible)
under
those
circumstance
we
compel
some
of
it
instead
of
the
whole
constitution
and
i
hope
you
discuss
the
(inaudible)
of
military
trial
(inaudible)
as
compared
with
the
advantages
of
the
other
trial,
which
provides
the
trial
by
jury.
the
number
of
people
to
be
affected
by
it
now,
that
is,
who
will
be
affected
by
it
tomorrow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
up-to-date,
how
many
veterans
are
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
21
million?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
for
some
offenses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
1951?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
come
effective
before
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
their
tenure
of
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
what
(voice
overlap)
--
did
they
have
any
fixed
tenure
of
office
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
in
many
instances
that
they
have
typical
clause
and
section
of
(inaudible)
then
jurors
who
are
under
obligation
to
nobody
to
do
anything
if
he
has
that
argument
raised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
love
to
direct
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
accordingly,
those
are
in
fact
cases
at
the
time
(inaudible)
and
the
concept
is
to
withdraw
this
case
the
problem
is
different
(inaudible).
one
would
be,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
norm,
the
active
norm,
everyday
nothing
that
could
try
typically
a
crime.
the
other
was
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
we
just
look
at
the
plain
words
of
the
constitution
(inaudible)
that
you
say
congress
has
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
that
would
indicate
(inaudible)
now
in
the
land
and
naval
forces.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
it
could
be
construed
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
plenty
of
argument
on
each
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
the
word.
justice
hugo
l.
black
general,
we're
--
we're
going
to
conclude
the
case
this
afternoon,
so
if
you
haven't
finished
you
may
proceed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say
the
same
thing
about
arrest,
and
detention,
and
confinement,
why
would
it
be
necessary
to
do
some
of
those
things
and
not
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
he
get
a

justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
he
get
it?
i'm
just
curious.
i
don't
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
be
the
way
to
get
bail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume
that
--
i
don't
know
of
any
law
or
statute
that
defies
a
court
the
right
against
bail
for
a
man
who
did
illegal
things
or
awaiting
trial.
he
might
