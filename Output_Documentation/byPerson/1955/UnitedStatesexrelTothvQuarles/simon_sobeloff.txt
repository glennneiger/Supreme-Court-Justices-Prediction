mr.
simon
sobeloff
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course
if
the
statement
to
the
question,
as
announced
by
my
brother
is
correct,
there's
no
problem
before
this
court.
he
states
the
question
in
some
language
like
this.
can
the
air
force
arrest
a
civilian
in
no
way
connected
with
the
military
service
at
anytime
pertinent
to
the
case?
and
he
has
no
difficulty
in
arising
there's
a
negative
answer,
and
i
agree
with
him.
if
this
were
the
case
of
military
service
attempting
to
exert
jurisdiction
over
a
civilian,
who
at
no
time
had
any
connection
with
the
military,
at
no
pertinent
time,
i
would
agree
with
its
conclusion.
this
is
not
such
a
case,
this
is
a
case
of
a
man
who
while
in
the
military
service
is
a
--
it
is
said
he's
discharged,
committed
a
murder
and
the
question
is
entirely
different
from
what
he
states.
it's
a
question
whether
having
been
in
the
military
service
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
offense
and
not
being
subject
to
any
accountability
in
any
civil
court,
federal
or
state,
whether
under
such
circumstances
congress
could
validly,
as
it
attempted,
grant
military
jurisdiction
to
trial.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
both
the
alternatives
were
presented
to
the
congressional
committee
and
very
cogent
arguments
were
made
both
ways,
but
there
was
no
constitutional
compulsion
on
congress
to
adopt
the
method
that
they
now
seem
to
prefer,
namely,
a
trial
in
the
civil
court.
i
have
no
doubt
that
congress
could
constitutionally
have
said
that
a
soldier
while
in
the
service
commits
an
offense
and
is
discharged,
shall
be
answerable
in
a
federal
court
or
in
a
state
court.
certainly
in
the
federal
court
after
his
discharge,
but
they
could
equally,
validly
say
they
shall
continue
to
be
applicable
to
the
military
jurisdiction
after
his
discharge,
despite
his
discharge
provided
and
these
are
the
provisions
they
put
in
there.
provided
it
is
an
offense
of
sufficient
magnitude,
namely,
where
the
charge
--
where
the
penalty
maybe
five
years
or
more.
provided
that
you
observe
the
limitations
provisions,
he
gets
the
benefits
of
that
and
provided
that
there
was
no
civil
court
that
can
entertain
the
charge.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
that
is
the
--
that
is
i
think
the
only
real
question
here.
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
now
to
deal
with
some
of
these
subsidiary
questions
of
procedure.
if
there
is
time
i'll
--
i'll
come
to
that.
but
i
think
i'd
better
--
first
of
all,
say
a
few
words
about
the
facts
to
distinguish
this
actual
case
from
the
perfectly
imaginative
one
that
has
been
presented
here,
and
then
i
want
to
go
to
this
main
constitutional
question.
this
is
not
the
case
of
somebody
being
shanghaied
from
civilian
life
to
answer
military
terms.
this
man
and
two
others
were
according
to
the
charge
and
according
to
the
--
on
the
page
of
the
case
that's
in
this
record,
involved
in
the
murder
of
a
civilian
korean
while
they
where
soldiers.
and
on
a
military
reservation
or
military
base,
two
of
the
men
involved
were
tried
according
to
military
law
and
received
their
penalty.
this
man
has
not
been,
because
the
charge
--
the
circumstances
were
not
discovered
until
after
he
had
been
discharged,
some
weeks
after
he's
been
discharged.
the
others
were
still
in
the
service
and
they
were
answered.
now,
what
are
the
facts
as
to
surrounding
his
arrest?
much
has
been
spoken
here
and
in
the
brief
more
has
said
by
the
man
being
carried
to
a
long
distance
to
answer
charges.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
others
were
convicted.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
don't
know,
i
think
they
have
served
their
time
and
are
discharged.
i
--
i
think
they
got
comparatively
light
sentences.
i
think
both
of
them.
certainly,
one
of
them
has
been
discharged,
perhaps
both.
and
there
is
no
reason
in
fairness
or
in
justice,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
--
or
in
the
fifth
amendment
when
properly
interpreted
and
related
to
this
thing
that
prevents
treating
the
three
alike.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem,
but
i
say
preliminarily
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
other
two
where
tried.
this
man
was
not
tried
simply
because
of
this
--
pursuant
to
circumstance
that
he
has
been
discharged
in
the
mean
time.
i'm
only
contrasting
this
to
the
case
of
a
civilian
who
is
being
brought
into
military
jurisdiction
this
is
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
but
he
was
not
a
civilian
at
the
time
of
the
events.
now
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
it
would
because
the
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
statute
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes,
specifically
there
is
a
reference.
the
section
3
(a)
says,
“subject
--
subject
to
the
provisions
of
article
43.”
now,
article
--
article
43
is
a
limitations
article.
article
43
is
the
limitations
article.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
now,
i
don't
know
whether
there's
a
limitations
for
murder
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
limitation
for
murder
in
any
civil
court.
but
there,
limitations
would
apply.
he
would
get
the
benefit
of
limitation.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
--
i
agree
that
if
there
is
no
limitations
for
that
particular
kind
of
a
crime,
he
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
it.
but
if
there
is
limitations,
he
gets
the
benefit
of
it
under
3
(a)
but
that's
a
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
--
i
suppose
there
are
some
serious
contrast.
there
are
such
crimes
in
civil
law.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
commanding
officer
would
be
whoever
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
service
is
--
or
in
an
orderly
fashion
delegated
to
do
it.
then
if
you
examine
the
--
the
record
on
pages
75
to
78,
you
have
every
step
in
regular
military
channels
that
accounts
for
the
issuance
of
the
order
in
the
first
place
by
the
acting
secretary
of
the
air
force
down
to
the
squad
that
was
actually
--
that
actually
undertook
his
arrest.
now,
get
back
to
the
discovery
of
this
offense.
there
was
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
certainly.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no.
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
is
the
man
who
must
authorize
it.
the
commanding
officer
is
referred
to
in
this
connection
on
page
41
or
40
of
our
brief,
defined
article
7
on
page
40
and
article
--
on
page
41
article
7
(c)
--
9
(c),
an
officer,
a
warrant
officer
or
a
civilian
subject
to
this
code,
or
to
trial
thereunder.
in
passing
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there
is
something
more
than
a
civilian
subject
to
the
code,
it
provide
--
it
covers
not
only
a
civilian
subject
to
the
code,
that
is
in
his
daily
light
as
regulated
by
the
code,
but
it
also
includes
a
person
who
is
subject
to
trial
under
the
code.
that
language
or
to
trial
thereunder
was
inserted
in
this
statute,
in
this
section
and
in
the
preceding
section
7
(b),
which
is
on
the
preceding
page
or
to
trial
thereunder.
in
the
act
of
1950
at
the
same
time
that
3
(a)
was
passed,
in
other
words,
it
was
made
coordinate
so
that
when
they
granted
by
3
(a)
authority
to
the
military,
to
continue
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
trial
over
a
military
person,
who
before
is
discharged
and
committed
an
offense.
they
also
said
that
these
provisions
as
to
procedure
shall
apply
to
--
not
only
to
the
civilian
subject
to
the
code,
which
is
a
class
that
had
always
traditionally
been
subject
to
the
code,
but
also
this
new
class
or
those
who
are
subject
to
trial
here
under
the
code.
in
that
way
and
this
is
no
shell
game,
it's
a
familiar
practice,
a
familiar
technique
when
you
interpret
a
statute,
to
interpret
not
only
one
section,
to
interpret
all
the
sections
to
see
if
they
hang
together.
this
particular
provision,
giving
the
benefit
of
the
procedures
to
those
who
are
subject
to
trial
under
the
code,
as
well
as
who
are
subject
to
regulation
under
the
code,
to
life
under
the
code
like
soldiers
and
civilians
in
army
camps.
this
provision
was
adopted
at
the
same
time
they're
created
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
got
to
read
those
three
together
to
--
for
it
to
make
any
sense.
it
shows
that
congress
intended
not
only
to
make
a
declaration
of
policy,
they
shall
be
amenable.
amenable
then
to
do
nothing
about
it?
no,
amenable
and
is
subject
to
these
other
provisions.
if
you
read
7
(a),
7
(b),
and
9
(c),
and
you
see
that
they
were
tailored
to
cover
people
like
toth,
to
cover
people
who
were
being
made
subject
to
trial
under
the
military
code.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
sir.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
sir.
and
historically
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
there
have
been
--
no,
sir.
there
have
been
civilians
who,
traditionally,
have
been
subject
to
trial
under
the
military
code.
in
their
case
too,
there
is
no
provision,
as
there
is
no
provision
in
the
case
of
the
soldier
where
he's
to
be
tried.
the
military
jurisdiction
is
not
divided
into
districts,
like
the
civil
jurisdiction.
they
can
be
tried
anywhere
and
when
they
--
this
man
is
made
subject
to
that
code,
he
can
be
tried
anywhere.
now,
where
was
he
tried?
after
all,
lets
--
let's
not
--
we
shouldn't
talk
about
an
abstract
case,
let's
talk
about
this
case.
this
man
was
taken
back
and
forth,
trial
in
the
place
of
the
alleged
offense
where
the
witnesses
were
and
this
court
has
said
in
the
case
--
there
was
one
case
where
a
man
objected
to
being
extradited
to
cuba,
while
the
american's
troops
where
there.
he
wanted
to
be
tried
by
a
military
commission,
an
american
military
commission,
and
he
objected
to
being
tried
under
spanish
justice.
this
court
said
there
is
no
constitutional
right
of
that
sort.
it's
perfectly
in
accordance
with
our
sense
of
justice
and
law
for
a
man
to
be
tried
in
the
place
of
the
alleged
offense,
and
that's
all
that
was
happening
here.
now,
i
want
to
clear
away
any
suggestion
because
the
brief
is
full
of
this
and
they
talk
about
this
man
being
spirited
away
to
some
distant
place.
he
was
notified
of
his
rights.
he
was
given
every
opportunity
to
employ
counsel.
he
was
told
he
could
communicate
with
his
family,
he
did
communicate
with
his
father,
he
told
his
father
he
didn't
want
any
lawyer.
they
told
him
he
could
have
military
lawyers
and
he
could
have
civil
lawyers.
they
did
assign
him
a
military
lawyer
and
later
civil
lawyer
--
a
civil
lawyer
was
gotten
for
him
by
his
family.
again
and
again
he
was
told
of
his
right,
he
didn't
want
to.
when
he
got
to
korea,
he
was
asked,
“do
you
want
--
do
you
want
to
get
your
own
lawyer,
a
civil
lawyer?
you
want
to
communicate
with
the
chaplain?”
he
says,
“i
don't
need
any
civil
lawyer,
i'll
be
satisfied
with
a
military
lawyer
and
as
for
the
chaplain,
my
mother
will
pay
for
him.”
i
mean
throughout
this
record,
you'll
get
the
feeling
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
an
outrage
has
been
committed
by
seizing
a
civilian
and
subjecting
him
through
a
strange
system,
and
where
he
was
taken
to
a
distant
place
that
had
no
relation
to
the
alleged
offense.
it's
a
case
of
a
man
who
while
in
the
military
service
committed
an
offense.
it's
true
that
since
then
he
was
removed,
immediately
discharged
from
the
service
but
he
comes
directly
under
this
3
(a),
which
was
intended
to
reach
such
cases.
the
hollohan
case,
which
is
notorious,
is
a
case
where
a
man
--
where
people
is
--
are
escaping
justice,
civil
or
military,
because
of
a
lapse
in
the
statutes
as
they
were
before
3
(a)
was
adopted.
and
3
(a)
was
adopted
simply
not
to
get
--
let
people
get
away
with
murder
and
it
says
that
where
there
is
a
civil
court
that
can
entertain
the
charge,
fine,
then
3
(a)
doesn't
apply.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
it
doesn't
--
it
--
i
won't
concede
that
it
has
no
relation
to
discipline.
i
think
it
has
a
very
direct
relation
to
discipline
for
soldiers
to
know
that
if
they
commit
offenses,
they'll
be
answerable,
even
though
they
are
discharged.
of
course
congress
could
have
provided
that
in
such
case
it
shall
go
to
the
civil
court,
but
they're
not
limited
to
that.
secondly,
even
if
it
does
not
relate
directly
to
military
discipline,
it
relates
to
cases
arising
in
the
armed
forces
and
that's
what
congress
is
given
authority
under
article
1
of
the
constitution
to
regulate
in
its
own
way
that
has
historically
done
that.
and
--
i
meant,
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
invoked
here
and
which
is
said
to
require
indictment
and
jury
trial,
itself
contains
an
exception
as
broad
as
the
original
grants
of
congress
for
--
to
authorize
military
trial.
it
says
except
in
cases
arising
in
the
army,
i
forgot
the
precise
word,
but
it
was
broad
as
article
1.
so
you
have
here
a
case
where
congress
in
the
broad
grant
of
power
under
the
constitution.
now,
we
don't
have
to
go
into
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fifth
amendment
guarantees
even
such
a
person
due
process
in
other
respects.
there's
no
point
raised
here
that
he
wasn't
given
due
process.
if
you
look
at
the
military
code,
you'll
find
every
provision
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
in
civil
life,
accorded
him
except
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
and
trial
by
a
jury.
all
these
other
things
are
accorded
in
by
the
code
and
if
there
--
jury
trial
and
the
--
the
grand
jury
indictment
or
the
jury
trial
are
not
to
provided
for,
the
answer
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
specifically
accepts
cases
arising
in
the
armed
service.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
--
i
get
that
both
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
and
from
a
considerable
--
of
all
the
consideration
of
the
purpose
of
the
thing.
in
the
first
place,
the
constitution
says
that
congress
may
make
rules
for
the
government
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
that's
right,
for
the
government
--
government
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
now,
the
question
is
of
course
not
whether
a
civilian
can
be
subjected
to
that.
the
question
is
whether
a
military
person
who
is
discharged
can
by
congressional
act
continue
be
made
--
continually
--
can
continue
to
be
amenable
by
congressional
act
to
this
military
--
answer
in
military
justice.
now,
there
are
number
of
considerations
that
i
think
are
pertinent
on
that.
the
language
itself,
i
think
is
broad
enough
of
the
constitution
to
provide
that
but
let's
see
what
--
what
is
the
--
in
history.
in
the
first
place,
you
have
the
act
of
19
--
of
1863,
the
section
that
my
brother
talked
about
it
has
to
do
to
--
with
army
contractors.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
that
section
was
struck
down.
an
attempt
to
make
a
man
who
is
--
who
has
a
contract
with
the
military
subject
to
military
law
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
obviously,
from
a
case
where
--
of
a
soldier
who
--
while
a
soldier
commits
an
offense.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
sir?
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
sir.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
sir.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
that
section
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes.
well,
they
--
they've
done
that.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
other
sections
of
the
act
of
1863
have
--
another
section
of
that
act
provided
that
any
soldier,
who
committed
a
fraud
against
the
united
states,
could
--
would
continue
to
be
answerable
to
--
to
the
military
authority,
even
after
his
discharge.
now,
this
court
has
never
passed
on
the
validity
of
that
section.
although,
it
was
referred
to
in
the
hirshberg
case
in
terms,
which
seemingly
did
not
regard
that
that
act
is
unreasonable.
i
don't
want
to
over
claim
for
what
that
opinion
said,
the
question
wasn't
before
the
court
and
i
don't
think
i
can
gain
much
strength
from
it
but
certainly
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
it
--
it
doesn't
weaken
our
argument.
the
hirshberg
case
didn't
deal
with
that.
it's
the
only
instance,
however,
in
which
the
--
the
statute
was
mentioned.
five
times
the
lower
courts,
lower
federal
courts
have
upheld
that
section.
so
you
have
a
history
of
90
years,
in
which
soldiers
who
had
committed
acts
of
fraud
while
in
the
service
continued
to
be
responsible,
amenable
to
military
justice,
even
after
they
are
discharged.
and
in
that
connection,
there
is
the
language
of
mr.
justice
cardozo,
where
he
speaks
of
the
quiescence
of
the
years
as
an
argument
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
statute.
now,
in
addition
to
the
act
of
1863,
two
courts
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
assumed
that
it
was
a
reasonable
provision.
now,
in
his
brief,
our
opponent
concedes
that
his
contention
in
this
--
as
to
this
statute
is
correct,
then
the
statute
of
1863,
which
has
been
on
the
books
and
has
been
followed
for
90
years
would
have
to
fall.
now,
i
say
--
i
submit
if
anyone
has
a
heavy
burden
who
undertakes
that
contention.
and
then
it
does
not
violate
our
basic
concepts
of
fairness
that
the
time
and
place
of
an
offense
should
govern
--
govern
jurisdiction.
in
the
case
that
i
alluded
you
before,
this
neely
and
henkel
case,
where
the
man
wanted
military
--
a
military
court
try
him.
this
court
said,
“no.
you
were
tried.
you've
admitted
the
offense
--
charged
with
an
offense
in
cuba,
which
is
subject
to
spanish
law.”
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
makes
it
illegal
for
you
to
be
removed
to
the
place
and
to
be
tried
by
the
justice
that
prevailed
in
the
place
at
the
time
of
alleged
offense,
and
that
is
true
as
to
extradition.
this
court
has
held
that
a
governor
doesn't
have
to
give
an
order
--
give
a
hearing
before
he
grants
extradition.
of
course
there
is
always
present
the
possibility
of
a
review
of
the
jurisdiction
by
habeas
corpus,
that's
always
open
and
it
was
availed
of
here.
and
what
is
the
scope
of
an
inquiry
of
that
kind?
all
that
can
be
heard
on
such
a
preliminary
hearing
is
whether
this
is
--
the
question
of
identity,
whether
this
is
the
man
that
they
intend
to
get,
to
arrest
and
at
most,
even
this
isn't
clearly
established
but
at
most
the
additional
question
as
to
whether
the
requirement
they
should
face.
he
concedes
his
identity,
it's
overwhelmingly
shown
that
--
in
this
record
that
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
and
under
the
circumstances,
no
one
can
say
that
he
hasn't
had
exactly
what
he
would
have
even
under
the
civil
law.
even
though
the
civil
law
--
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
any
preliminary
hearing
before
removal,
except
where
a
statute
provides
it.
and
then
finally,
what
is
--
how
do
we
test
fundamental
fairness?
this
court
has
said
in
talking
of
military
jurisdiction,
that
there's
no
doubt
that
the
military
has
jurisdiction
or
congress
can
grant
the
military
jurisdiction
in
cases
--
in
the
manner
of
practice
by
civilized
nation.
now,
if
you
look
at
belgium
and
you'll
see
what
have
civilized
nations
done
in
this
situation,
you'll
find
that
the
countries
that
have
systems
of
justice
closely
related
to
ours,
having
a
common
origin
with
ours,
england,
canada,
australia,
new
zealand.
in
each
of
these
countries
they
have
laws
that
do
exactly
what
3
(a)
does.
let's
say
that
if
a
man
in
the
armed
services
commits
an
offense
that
he
would
be
answerable
to
the
military
court.
that
military
court
can
exert
its
jurisdiction
over
him
after
his
discharge.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
don't
know
about
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
contractors
but
there
are
a
great
many
civilians
who
--
who
work
with
the
army
in
army
camps
and
so
forth.
they
are
subject
to
military
justice
traditionally,
historically
so.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
--
i
don't
think
contractors.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
he
would
--
they
would
--
yes,
because
this
provision,
the
code
has
always
applied,
not
only
to
officers
and
men
in
the
service
but
to
civilians.
and
this
section
on
page
41
of
our
brief,
9
(c),
speaks
of
officers,
warrant
officers
or
civilians
subject
to
this
code,
that's
the
old
law,
and
then
this
new
language
or
one
who
is
subject
to
trial
thereunder.
in
other
words,
3
(a)
made
him
subject
to
trial
under
the
code,
even
though
he
wasn't
the
kind
of
civilian
who
is
subject
to
the
code.
in
other
words,
he
is
not
subject
to
the
code,
generally,
but
he
is
subject
to
the
code
for
the
purpose
of
trial
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
but
(inaudible)
mr.
simon
sobeloff
any
civilian
who
is
subject
to
the
code
would
be
subject
to
trial
now,
despite
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
but
now
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
and
if
we
had
a
treaty
with
korea,
toth
would
be
the
extradited
and
tried
in
a
court
there
and
he
wouldn't
have
either
civil
or
military
american
justice.
and
for
the
perfect
correctness
from
a
constitutional
stand
point,
he
couldn't
be
heard
to
complain
that
he
doesn't
want
to
be
tried
according
to
korean
justice,
which
may
give
him
none
of
this
protection.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
but
i
--
i
say
that
the
fact
that
there
are
cases
where
--
of
extradition,
which
have
been
approved
by
this
court
where
a
man
was
sent
to
a
country
to
answer
charges,
where
he
didn't
have
a
fifth
amendment
or
any
other
protections,
that's
not
an
argument.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
exactly.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
would
say
i
assign
this
weight
to
it
and
i
think
this
is
a
fair
and
balanced
answer
to
that
question.
after
all,
when
you
were
interpreting
broad
language
like
the
fifth
amendment,
you
want
to
ask
yourself,
what
does
our
innate
sense
of
justice
tell
us?
this
is
an
outrageous
thing
that
got
--
does
conflict
with
--
with
our
sense
of
right
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
is
it
a
dangerous
thing?
yes,
you
can
--
you
can
ask
that,
but
you
have
--
you
have
to
ask
that
question
with
some
limitation
too
because
there
are
many
powers
that
are
dangerous
and
there
--
and
they
are
not
there
for
improper
or
illegal
in
a
constitutional
sense.
even
the
most
common
place
powers
have
dangers,
they
maybe
abused.
that's
not
an
argument
against
the
existence
of
the
power
or
the
constitutionality
of
congress
granted
it
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
but
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
sir?
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
--
i
merely
wanted
to
suggest
that
no
one
can
say
that
this
thing
is
a
shocking
thing,
that
--
that
it
clashes
hopelessly
with
our
sense
of
justice
when
these
four
countries
have
done
it,
when
we
have
done
it
in
a
narrower
way,
under
the
act
of
1863
for
90
years.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
the
specific
provision
that
they
tried
to
invoke
in
the
fifth
amendment
contains
the
exception
which
makes
the
whole
thing
irrelevant
which
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
the
argument.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
there
--
there
is
no
specific
provision.
the
--
the
specific
provision
contains
the
exception
which
removes
it
from
--
from
that.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
right.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
right.
now
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
very
happy
that
you
direct
my
attention
to
that
because
it
enables
me
to
say
that
this
great
horror
that
is
painted
in
the
brief
about
making
millions
of
veterans
subject
to
military
justice
after
their
discharge
is
a
pure
figment
of
the
imagination.
actually,
this
law
has
been
applied
in
a
number
of
cases
that
can
be
counted
on
the
hands
of
a
man
--
on
the
fingers
of
a
man's
hand.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
there
--
there
are
millions
of
veterans.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
there
are
millions
of
veterans
but
there
--
there
are
statutes
of
limitation,
there
are
many
offenses
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
for
some
offenses.
actually,
this
has
been
employed
in
very
few
cases,
that's
one
answer.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
it's
the
fact
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
i
would
be
in
any
better
case
if
they
could
show
that
there
were
a
million
such
cases.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
right.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
then
i
want
to
say
that
this,
in
any
event,
would
apply
only
to
cases,
to
offenses
committed
after
1951
when
this
code
became
effective.
that
may
require
a
little
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes,
when
this
code
became
effective.
it
couldn't
be
retroactive
to
grant
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
it
--
it
became
effective
in
1950.
yes,
he
didn't
commit
the
offense,
discharged
with
the
commission
of
the
offense
in
the
fall
of
1952.
that
requires
a
little
amendment
of
my
answer
to
your
question
about
limitations
and
--
and
the
first
world
war,
anything
that
happened
before
1950
or
1951
would
not
be
covered
by
this
section.
now,
as
to
the
advantages,
i'm
not
one
to
minimize
the
importance
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
grand
jury
provision,
the
provision
for
trial
by
jury,
but
take
the
grand
jury
provision.
if
you
examine
this
code,
you'll
find
a
very
meticulous
procedure
laid
down
which
grants
the
suspect
greater
rights
even
than
a
civilian
had.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
before
military
judges,
it's
true.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
before
military
judges,
it's
true.
but
on
that,
let
me
read
you
what
justice
--
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
“in
a
military
case
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
i
don't
know
that
officers
have
fixed
tenure
on.
but
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
a
careful
investigation
is
required.you
cannot
be
arrested
except
on
the
personal
order
of
the
secretary
of
the
--
of
the
armed
--
of
the
branch
of
the
armed
services
that
is
involved.
he
must
be
given
--
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
an
explanation.
in
civil
life,
a
man
who
is
being
investigated
by
a
grand
jury
does
not
have
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
case.
he's
not
required
to
appear
before
the
investigators
but
he
is
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
and
to
have
counsel,
and
to
cross-examine
witnesses
during
the
preliminary
investigation
before
the
charges
formulated.
now,
i
say
that's
a
very
substantial
right
and
protection
and
one
that
even
in
civil
life
is
not
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
pertinent
consideration.
and
then
if
you
--
i
wish
your
honors
in
considering
to
this
case
would
leap
through
the
military
code
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
and
--
and
the
regulations.
and
by
the
way,
it's
said
here
that
congress
didn't
adopt
the
regulation.
congress
specifically
gives
the
president
the
power
to
adopt
regulations,
it
maybe
that
he
had
that
power
inherently
anyway
but
congress
specifically
gave
him
the
power
to
adopt
regulation
and
they
are
recognized
in
this
code.
i'd
like
to
read
just
a
sentence
from
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
sawyer
--
mr.
justice
sawyer
in
the
bogart
case
and
then
there
is
one
about
holmes.
this
court
has
no
more
right
to
assume
or
suppose
that
those,
who
by
the
constitution
and
laws
are
made
the
depositories
of
jurisdiction
over
military
offenses,
will
abuse
those
powers
than
those
who
by
the
same
constitution
and
laws
are
entrusted
with
the
general
civil
jurisdiction
of
the
land,
will
abuse
the
trust
devolved
upon
them.
and
then
there
is
the
other
expression
from
the
comparatively
recent
case
of
burns
and
wilson
in
this
court,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
recall
again
that
the
basic
guarantees
of
due
process
have
long
been
recognized
and
honored
by
the
military
courts
as
well
as
the
civil
courts.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
and
if
this
man
were
a
citizen
and
had
no
connection
at
any
pertinent
time
with
the
military,
i
would
agree
that
he
has
no
place
in
any
military
court.
but
it
is
certainly
no
irrational,
or
harsh,
or
unfair,
or
shocking
extension
for
congress
to
say
that
the
military
jurisdiction
which
would
attach
if
he
were
still
in
the
service
continues
with
respect
to
his
offenses
committed
while
in
that
service,
even
after
he's
been
discharged.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
precisely,
yes.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
it's
really
the
first
--
the
first
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
that's
right.
it's
under
the
first
article
of
the
constitution.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
arose
and
our
answer
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes,
as
to
that
our
answer
is
a
case
arises
when
the
circumstances
to
be
inquired
into
happened.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
when
the
crime
is
committed,
that's
when
this
case
arose.
they
weren't
talking
about
the
time
when
a
--
a
writ
was
issued
or
a
paper
was
filed.
they
were
talking
about
happenings.
when
you
talk
about
--
has
a
case
arising
on
the
high
seas
or
on
the
mississippi
river,
you
don't
mean
the
papers
that
were
filed,
that
they
have
to
be
filed
on
the
high
seas
or
the
mississippi
river.
but
the
events
to
be
inquired
into
happened,
its
--
the
circumstances
occurred
on
the
high
seas
or
in
this
case,
in
the
land
or
naval
forces.
that's
the
common
sense
meaning
of
it
and
has
--
did
arise,
this
is
a
case
that
did
arise
in
the
--
in
--
in
the
land
and
naval
forces.
look
what
an
absurd
result
would
follow
if
you
--
if
you
accept
our
adversary's
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion
to
say
that
a
case
arises
where
and
when
the
charge
is
instituted
and
not
when
the
facts
occurred.
it
would
result
that
a
man
in
civil
life,
who
commits
an
offense
and
then
becomes
a
soldier,
after
that,
would
be
subject
to
trial
by
a
court-martial
because
a
case
according
to
that
interpretation
arises
in
the
land
or
naval
forces.
but
obviously
that
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
papers
are
being
filed
while
he's
in
the
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
exactly.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
he
was
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
wasn't
a
civilian
when
the
papers
were
filed.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
if
--
if
he
--
if
it's
done
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
but
this
man
cannot
be
tried
in
a
civilian
court.
there
is
no
american
court,
federal
or
state
that
has
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
congress
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
congress
could
--
i'm
frank
to
say,
congress
could
constitutionally
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
and
there
was
very
respectable
argument
made
for
that
course.
i'm
not
contending
against
that
but
i
say
that
the
choice
was
for
congress
and
it's
not
for
the
court
to
decide,
we
prefer
this
alternative
to
the
other.
congress
was
the
judge
of
that
under
the
plenary
power
granted
them
under
article
1
and
clarified
and
shown
not
to
be
impaired
by
the
fifth
amendment
because
of
the
accepting
language
in
--
in
that
amendment.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
think
you
can
say
--
you
can
say
in
governing
the
land
and
naval
forces,
you
can
provide
that
any
member
of
those
forces
who
commits
an
offense
shall
continue
amenable,
notwithstanding
his
subsequent
discharge
because
their
jurisdiction
attaches
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
oh,
i
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
if
--
if
--
as
to
the
words
and
as
to
the
spirit,
but
that's
true
of
almost
every
case
that
comes
before
the
court.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
oh,
all
right,
i'm
--
i'm
very
grateful
to
the
court.
now,
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
if
i
may,
your
honors,
with
regard
to
some
of
these
procedural
questions
that
are
raised.
some
of
them
have
to
do
with
the
interpretation
of
3
(a),
the
statute
itself
and
some
have
to
do
with
a
question
of
procedural
due
process.
i
think
i've
already
spoken
of
the
provisions
about
arrest
and
trial
or
removal
because
i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
plain
that
article
3
(a)
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
7
and
9,
which
are
also
in
the
same
code
and
which
were
amended
and
tailored
to
fit
this
situation.
and
if
you
look
at
the
hearings,
the
report
of
the
hearings
you'll
see
that
they
had
exactly
the
hirshberg
decision
in
mind
and
such
cases
as
the
hollohan
case,
which
had
not
achieve
quite
the
notoriety
of
hollohan
but
were
already
coming
to
the
floor.
they
had
those
cases
in
mind.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
where
it
says
subject
to
trial,
when
you
say
that
a
man
shall
be
amenable,
notwithstanding
his
discharge
and
you
say
elsewhere
that
he
is
subject
to
trial
in
the
military
court,
and
shall
be
granted
certain
rights,
and
shall
be
treated
in
a
certain
way,
i
think
you've
covered
it.
i
think
you've
got
to
read
the
whole
code
to
see
what
that
body
of
law
is,
its
not
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
but
they
merely
say
in
3
(a)
--
in
3
(a)
they
say
that
he
shall
not
be
relieved
for
the
amenability
to
trial
by
courts-martial.
now,
it
doesn't
simply
say
it
shall
not
be
--
shall
continue
amenable
as
a
moral
matter
to
the
guilt
of
his
crime.
it
says
he
shall
not
be
relieved
of
amenability
to
trial
by
courts-martial.
he
was
certainly
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial
before
he
is
discharged.
the
congress
says
in
3
(a),
he
shall
not
be
relieved
of
that
amenability
to
trial.
now,
what
kind
of
trial,
what
kind
of
investigation,
what
kind
of
charges,
what
kind
of
authority
for
his
arrest?
you
have
to
look
to
the
courts-martial
regulations
and
the
code
to
see
what
that
is
because
he
is
--
you
don't
have
that
as
to
soldiers
either
in
the
statute,
you
have
it
in
these
rules.
and
these
rules
are
made
applicable
to
him
because
courts-martial
are
made
applicable.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
much
difficulty
about
that.
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
that
he
was
given
every
consideration
that
these
rules
entitled
him
to
or
that
any
one
sense
of
fairness
might
suggest.
now,
then
as
to
commanding
officer,
i've
said
something
about
that
but
i
think
it
maybe
well
to
add.
when
we
--
we
talk
of
a
commanding
officer,
the
commanding
officer
--
where
is
that
language?
in
41
in
our
brief.
the
commanding
officer,
now
that
doesn't
mean
the
man
who
would
give
him
orders
if
he
was
a
soldier
because
he
might
have
a
commanding
officer
--
one
commanding
officer
one
day
and
another
--
another
day.
the
commanding
officer
who
is
involved
at
the
time
in
this
matter
and
on
page
41,
section
(c)
--
9
(c)
"an
officer,
a
warrant
officer
or
civilian
subject
to
this
code
or
to
trial
thereunder
maybe
ordered
into
arrest
or
confinement
only
by
a
commanding
officer
to
whose
authority
he
is
subject.”
to
whose
authority
he
is
subject
for
arrest.
he
is
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
--
of
the
commanding
officer
of
the
fifth
base
or
whatever
that
--
the
title
was,
or
the
person
that
he
designates,
or
the
squad
that
he
sends
out
to
effect
that
arrest,
he
doesn't
--
the
general
doesn't
go
after
himself.
and
that
says
how
by
an
order
oral
or
written,
delivered
in
person
or
by
another
officer,
the
record
shows
how
that
was
done.
there
is
no
lapse,
there
is
no
lag
there.
the
authorities
order
such
persons
into
arrest
for
confinement
may
not
be
delegated.
suppose
that
that
means
that
the
original
order
of
arrest
has
to
be
examined
into
and
ordered
by
the
secretary
himself
and
that
was
done
in
this
case,
that
was
done
in
this
case.
but
the
actual
execution
of
the
order
is
--
is
delegated,
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
secretary
himself
shall
go
out
and
arrest
the
man.
now,
in
all
military
jurisdiction,
not
only
in
the
case
of
the
discharged
soldier,
but
in
the
case
of
an
active
soldier,
you
don't
find
any
statute
that
says
who
has
authority,
who
is
the
commanding
officer
that's
to
be
found
in
the
orders,
and
the
regulations,
and
the
designations
that
are
made
in
the
regular
course
in
military
trial.
and
this
doesn't
say
his
commanding
officer,
there's
nothing
to
intimate
that,
it
means
the
man
who
was
in
charge
at
the
time
when
he
was
in
the
service,
the
commanding
officer
who
is
designated
for
this
purpose.
now,
there
was
something
said
about
bail,
there's
no
provision
for
bail
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i'm
sure
that
that
would
be
such
an
absurd
to
the
construction
that
nobody
would
adopt
it.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
3
(a)
itself.
if
you
look
at
3
(a)
says
that
the
secretary
of
the
service
--
or
paragraph
11
(b)
of
the
manual
--
let
me
have
that.
it
says
that
the
secretary
personally
shall
sign
the
order
of
arrest.
it's
not
left
to
any
subordinate
to
decide
that
he
shall
be
arrested.
but
the
execution
of
the
order
of
course
is
done
by
the
--
the
foot
soldiers,
it
isn't
done
by
the
secretary.
in
this
manual
for
courts-martial
in
page
15,
the
jurisdiction
under
article
3
(a)
should
not
be
exercised
without
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
depart
--
department
concerned.
it
was
simply
an
additional
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
sir?
mr.
simon
sobeloff
without
the
consent.
well,
in
this
case
he
actually
did
the
ordering.
it's
an
additional
safeguard
against
wholesale
use
of
this
section
3
(a)
without
careful
effect.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
no.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
--
the
commanding
--
the
signing
of
the
order
by
the
secretary
is
what's
required
under
this
manual,
which
i
think
gives
a
protection
even
more
than
3
(a).
3
(a)
simply
says
that
he
shall
not
be
relieved
of
amenability.
he
does
not
in
itself
say
who
shall
order
the
arrest
and
so
forth.
but
taking
3
(a)
with
7
and
9,
you
see
that
the
code
is
made
applicable.
now,
the
code
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
order
--
the
order
signed
by
the
secretary
as
this
record
will
show
was
directed
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
fifth
airbase.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
to
arrest
this
man
for
such
and
such
reasons.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
orders
him
arrested
and
he
directs
that
to
the
commanding
officer
of
--
of
the
airbase.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
--
the
section
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
he
--
he
ordered
it,
so
of
course
an
order
includes
a
consent.
if
it
--
if
it
said
he
shall
order
it
and
he
merely
consented
there
might
be
a
question,
if
it
says
he
shall
consent
and
he
personally
ordered
it,
there's
no
problem.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
no,
he
--
he
is
the
one
who
orders
it
but
the
execution
of
it
is
by
a
commanding
officer
to
whom
he
sends
the
order.
article
3
(a)
gives
military
jurisdiction.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
i
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
the
documents
in
this
case
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
it
was
sent
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
fifth
airbase
and
he
designates
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
he
--
he
directs
a
certain
colonel
to
execute
it
and
the
colonel
sends
his
men
to
do
it.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
he
says,
"commander
of
the
fifth
airbase,
arrest
this
man.”
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
i
assume
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
assume
that
that's
raised.
but
he
personally
signed
it
after
reviewing
the
papers.
and
then
he
directs
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
and
then
he
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
then
he
directs
the
--
the
--
a
commandant
of
the
fifth
base.
and
he
--
as
you'll
see
from
the
record,
sends
it
to
the
colonel
and
the
colonel
to
--
to
his
subordinates.
now
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
i
don't
know.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
don't
know.
i
would
imagine
--
i
would
have
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i
would
imagine
because
--
i
don't
know
but
they
proceeded
here
as
they
usually
do
through
delegating
the
order
to
arrest.
i
suppose
that
the
thing
that
they
meant
was
that
the
actual
order
to
make
this
man
amenable.
the
actual
order
of
arrest
has
to
be
reviewed
by
a
high
official,
a
--
the
civilian
secretary.
i
don't
think
it
means
that
he's
got
to
go
out
to
make
the
arrest
himself.
now,
something
was
said
here
about
bail
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
right,
and
--
and
if
there's
any
--
and
they
did
in
this
case
what
they
do
in
any
case
where
an
order
is
issued
for
arrest.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i'm
sure
he
could.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i'm
sure
he
could.
i'm
--
i'm
equally
sure
that
the
general
wouldn't
have
to
go
out
and
do
it
himself.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
i'll
inquire.
i
mean
that
--
that
has
to
do
with
practice
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
but
i'll
inquire
of
the
air
force
about
that.
perhaps
this
point
is
not
of
sufficient
gravity
but
i
would
like
to
--
to
say
a
word
about
this
bail
business.
it's
pointed
out
that
nowhere
here
is
there
any
provision
for
bail.
well,
nowhere
is
there
very
much
of
a
right
of
bail
in
a
capital
offense
in
civil
courts
either.
but
actually,
this
man
is
in
no
position
to
complain
because
he
is
out
on
bail,
he's
out
on
bail
now
and
i
think
its
whipping
up
a
--
mr.
simon
sobeloff
--
scarecrow.
sir?
mr.
simon
sobeloff
well,
when
he
suit
out
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
he
was
discharged.
mr.
simon
sobeloff
that's
the
way
to
do
it,
you
can
always
--
you
can
always
do
that.
the
fact
that
this
doesn't
specifically
provide
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
and
it
didn't
hurt
this
man.
i
think
the
time
is
so
short.
i'd
better
not
go
into
other
matters
which
are
in
any
event
covered
in
our
brief.
