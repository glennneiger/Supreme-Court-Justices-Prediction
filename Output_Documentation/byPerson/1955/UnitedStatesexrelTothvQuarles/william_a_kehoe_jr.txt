mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
if
the
court
pleases.
the
case
at
far
arose
upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
we
are
here
before
the
court
and
the
case
comes
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
to
the
united
states
--
running
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
facts
of
the
case
very
briefly
stated
are
as
follows.
toth,
the
prisoner
on
whose
behalf
of
petition
was
filed
in
the
district
court
is
an
honorably
discharged
serviceman.
he
was
discharged
from
the
united
states
air
forces
on
december
8,
1952.prior
to
his
discharge,
he
had
served
in
korea.
from
the
time
of
his
discharge
on
december
8,
1952
up
until
the
present
time,
toth
was
then
and
is
a
civilian
resident
of
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania.
as
to
my
understanding
that
at
the
present
time,
he
is
employed
by
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
at
the
time
the
incidence,
which
we
will
allude
to
in
a
minute,
occurred
he
was
employed
in
civilian
capacity
at
a
steel
plant
in
pittsburgh.
on
april
8,
1953,
there
was
an
accusation
filed,
a
sworn
accusation
filed
against
toth
by
colonel
hurst,
who
was
attached
to
the
fifth
air
force
in
korea,
alleging
and
accusing
toth
of
having
committed
murder
and
also
accusing
him
of
conspiring
to
commit
murder
on
or
about
september
27,
1952
at
a
time
prior
to
his
discharge
from
the
service.
on
april
30,
1953,
the
acting
secretary
of
the
air
force
ordered
the
apprehension
of
toth
and
his
delivery
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
fifth
air
force
in
korea.
on
may
11,
1953,
i
allude
to
this
fact
because
of
the
argument
that
will
subsequently
be
made
about
who
is
toth's
commanding
officer
or
who
could
have
been
toth's
commanding
officer,
should
be
noted
that
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
ordered
him
to
be
delivered
to
the
commanding
general
of
the
fifth
air
force
on
may
11,
1953
according
to
the
record.
the
commanding
general
of
the
continental
air
command
at
mitchel
air
force
base
in
new
york
ordered
the
apprehension
or
arrest
of
toth.
on
may
13,
1953,
toth
was
arrested
by
a
major
and
captain,
and
three
air
policemen
and
as
they
entered
his
place
of
employment
in
pittsburgh,
he
was
subsequently
transported
to
korea.
on
may
27,
at
the
time
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed,
toth
was
in
confinement
on
the
order
of
the
air
forces
in
korea
and
he
was
in
confinement
until
september
3,
1953
when
the
district
court
sustained
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
ordered
his
discharge.
the
issue
which
is
presented
to
the
court
is
very
broadly
stated
as
whether
congress
invalidly
enact
legislation
which
would
seek
the
court-martial
of
a
civilian
who
was
not
connected
with
or
affiliated
in
any
manner
with
the
armed
forces
and
cause
such
a
civilian
to
be
arrested,
confined,
and
transported
from
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania,
some
13,000
miles
to
a
foreign
country
of
korea
without
any
hearing
of
any
type,
and
there
to
be
held
for
the
purposes
of
a
court-martial.
our
case
is
broken
down
into
three
broad
parts.
the
first
part,
if
we
can
put
it
that
way
is
the
failure
of
authority
under
the
constitution
for
congress
to
enact
legislation,
looking
to
the
court-martial
of
a
civilian.
the
second
part
is
a
complete
bar
in
the
constitution
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
and
the
third
part,
looking
to
the
uniformed
code
of
military
justice
itself
is
that
there
is
a
casus
omissus
in
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
make
it
very
clear
to
the
court
a
few
general
statements
that
toth
at
all
times,
pertinent
to
the
inquiry
here,
was
a
civilian.
he
is
still
a
civilian.
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
or
apprehended
by
the
air
force
police,
he
was
a
civilian.
as
i
stand
before
the
court
this
afternoon,
he
is
a
civilian.
if
when
he
was
arrested,
he
had
worn
or
was
wearing
an
air
force
uniform
or
any
part
of
an
air
force
uniform
which
would
connect
him
with
the
air
force,
he
would
have
been
subject
and
would
be
presently
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
in
a
civil
court.
that's
under
our
code.
he
had
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
military
forces.
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
reserve.
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
component
parts
of
the
air
force.
he
was
receiving
no
benefit
from
the
air
force.his
connection
with
the
air
force
had
completely
--
been
completely
severed
with
his
honorable
discharge.
more
importantly,
he
had
no
commanding
officer
under
any
manner,
shape
or
form.
he
was
completely
and
fully
a
civilian.
there
was
no
officer
of
the
air
force
who
could
order
him
to
go
and
he
would
have
to
go
or
to
come
and
he
would
have
to
come.
there
was
no
one
in
the
air
force
who
had
any
supervision
or
authority
over
toth
at
all
at
the
time
of
his
apprehension
and
up
until
the
present
time.
i
would
also
like
to
allude
to
the
fact
and
make
it
very
clear
that
the
court-martial
procedures,
which
have
been
in
effect
in
this
country
since
prior
to
our
constitution,
are
in
no
sense
to
the
word
“a
judicial
procedure.”
the
purpose
of
the
court-martial
is
not
to
give
justice.
the
purpose
of
the
court-martial
is
to
summarily
punish
disobedience
among
the
military
forces.
this
court
has
held
many
years
ago
that
a
court-martial
and
the
army
was
no
--
in
nowise
a
part
of
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government.
that
was
in
dynes
versus
hoover,
i
think
was
decided
in
1827
and
during
the
course
of
the
civil
war
in
ex
parte
vallandigham,
this
court
also
alluded
to
the
fact
that
an
appeal
from
a
military
commission
was
not
a
part
of
our
judicial
system.
the
purpose
of
a
court-martial
is
to
maintain
discipline
in
the
ranks.
we
say
that
we
would
like
to
emphasize
that
fact
because
there's
been
allusions
in
the
government's
brief
and
allusions
as
i
recall
them
at
the
time
of
the
prior
argument,
that
it
was
a
proper
function
of
congress
to
pass
this
article
3
(a)
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
to
see
that
discharged
servicemen
were
meted
out
justice.
now,
that
is
not
the
principle
or
problem
of
congress
when
it
enacts
regulations
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
once
the
man
is
discharged
from
the
service,
the
land
and
naval
forces
has
no
problem
in
connection
with
their
punishment.
and
we
say
again
as
we
said
that
the
--
have
said
in
our
brief
and
said
at
the
time
of
the
previous
argument
that
if
the
issue
which
is
presented
or
was
presented
to
congress
was
looking
to
justice
then
congress
can
enact
a
valid
statute
which
would
ensure
to
an
accused
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
the
history
of
court-martial
procedures
as
we
know
it
in
this
country
or
in
best
of
my
research
would
apparently
commence
with
the
mutiny
act,
which
was
passed
in
great
britain,
1689
at
the
time
that
william
of
orange
mounted
to
the
throne
of
england
and
the
irish
truce
which
were
--
had
served
--
were
--
were
serving
in
the
army
at
that
time
determines
the
mutiny
against
his
authority.
the
mutiny
act
which
was
passed
in
1689
was
for
a
very
brief
period
of
time
and
it
provided
for
the
punishment
of
soldiers
as
a
court-martial
procedure
toward
mutiny
from
the
army.
but
it
starts
off
in
this
fashion,
the
law
of
england
and
whereas
“no
man
may
be
forejudged
of
life
or
limbe
or
subjected
to
any
kinde
of
punishment
by
martiall
law
or
in
any
other
manner
then
by
the
judgment
of
his
peeres
and
according
to
the
knowne
and
established
laws
of
this
realme."
yet
nevertheless,
it
being
requisite
for
retaining
such
forces
as
are
or
shall
be
raised
during
this
exigency
of
affairs
in
their
duties,
an
exact
discipline
be
observed,
and
that
soldiers
who
shall
mutiny
or
stir
up
sedition,
or
shall
desert
the
majesty's
service,
be
brought
to
a
more
exemplary
and
speedy
punishment
than
the
usual
forms
of
law
shall
allow.
at
the
time
this
mutiny
act,
incidentally,
the
original
mutiny
act
was
in
existence,
i
think
from
april
until
november.
it
was
the
intent
of
the
parliament
even
in
those
crucial
days
to
see
and
to
make
the
statement
as
a
part
of
the
mutiny
act
that
the
jury
trial
would
not
be
denied
even
to
the
soldier,
except
in
the
particular
case
of
mutiny
or
rebellion.
the
mutiny
act
has
been
in
existence
i
think
under
various
phases
and
aspects
of
it
in
england
until
1881.
at
the
time
of
the
american
revolution,
there
was
an
existence
to
british
articles
of
war
of
1765.
to
digress
for
a
minute,
it
has
been
stated
that
both
the
british
army
and
the
american
army
during
the
time
of
the
revolution
had
the
same
--
same
articles,
identical
articles
for
the
government
of
the
troops.
and
the
british
act
of
1765
was
the
act
that
governed
the
british
troops
at
the
time
of
the
american
revolution.
that
those
articles
specifically
provided
that
in
the
event
of
murder,
or
capital
offense
committed
by
any
of
the
troops,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
commanding
officer
to
turn
that
soldier
over
the
civil
magistrate
to
be
tried
according
to
the
civil
law.
that's
section
11,
article
i
of
the
british
articles
of
1765.
and
if
your
honors
will
recall
for
a
moment
in
the
boston
massacre
of
1770,
which
the
british
troops
fired
on
the
citizens
living
in
boston
and
killed
i
believe
some
five
citizens
and
the
great
human
cry
they
raised
at
that
time
to
have
those
british
soldiers
summarily
punished
and
court-martialed.
john
adams
came
to
the
defense
of
the
british
soldiers
and
by
legitimate
means,
it
was
held
that
those
men
should
be
tried
in
the
civil
courts
of
massachusetts
and
sometime
after
the
massacre
occurred,
they
were
tried
in
the
civil
courts
of
massachusetts,
and
the
captain
in
charge
of
the
troops
was
acquitted
by
the
civil
court,
a
jury
trial.
and
i
believe
that
the
highest
penalty
meted
out
by
that
court
was
the
penalty
of
manslaughter.
after
the
british
articles
of
war,
the
continental
congress
in
massachusetts
passed
the
massachusetts
articles
of
war
in
1775.
it's
pretty
much
the
same
and
identical
to
the
british
articles
of
war,
except
that
the
soldiers
had
the
right
who
were
serving
in
the
massachusetts
colony
at
that
time
not
to
subscribe
to
those
articles
of
war
if
they
didn't
see
fit.
the
continental
congress
in
june
30
of
1775
passed
the
american
articles
of
war
and
they
were
based
on
the
british
articles
of
1765.
on
september
20th,
1766,
the
american
articles
of
war
were
revised
by
the
continental
congress
and
those
articles
specifically
provided
that
the
soldier
who
committed
murder
or
a
capital
offense
would
be
turned
over
to
a
civilian
magistrate
for
trial.
now,
the
same
congress
which
enacted
--
continental
congress,
which
enacted
the
american
articles
of
war
of
1776,
also
brought
into
being
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution
clause
14,
that
the
congress
shall
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
that
phrase
as
it
is
contained
in
the
constitution
is
lifted
from
the
articles
of
confederation,
word
per
word,
the
power
of
congress.
and
we
have
the
congress
that
first
started
--
the
confederate
congress,
not
the
constitutional
congress
but
the
congress
that
was
in
existence
in
1776
that
provided
or
instituted
this
provision
of
what
congress
should
do
with
respect
to
the
military,
specifically
providing
in
the
first
articles
which
it
adopted
that
a
man
who
was
accused
of
murder
or
a
capital
offense
should
be
turned
over
to
the
civil
magistrate
for
trial.
we
also
know
that
in
england,
about
that
time,
the
case
of
grant
versus
gould,
it
was
decided
and
in
that
case
the
issue
under
then
the
british
mutiny
acts
and
their
articles
of
war
was
whether
--
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
court
was
whether
or
not
the
accused
was
a
civilian
because
if
he
was
a
civilian,
he
could
not
be
court-martialed
irrespective
of
whether
he
had
served
in
the
army
before.
grant
versus
gould
is
reported
at
2
henry
blackstone,
page
69,
126
english
reports
at
434.
i
would
also
like
to
make
it
clear
that
brings
us
up
to
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted.
now,
since
the
time
the
constitution
has
been
adopted,
there
was
never
any
provision
in
any
articles
of
war
that
a
civilian
could
be
tried
by
the
military
and
looking
at
the
articles
that
were
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
navy
and
the
articles
that
were
adopted
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
army,
there
was
never
any
provision
in
any
code
or
any
statute
that
discharge
from
the
service
was
a
bar
to
subsequent
prosecution.
there
was
the
usual
statute
of
limitations
contained
in
the
articles
of
two
years
or
something
of
that
sort,
five
years.
no
statute
in
the
event
of
murder
but
there
was
never
any
provision
in
the
articles
that
discharge
from
the
service
was
a
bar,
that
honorable
discharge
from
the
service
was
a
bar,
or
that
dismissal
from
the
service
was
a
bar.
yet
up
until
the
time
--
up
until
the
present
time,
in
fact,
it
has
been
the
universal
holdings
of
the
courts
that
discharge
of
the
--
from
the
service
is
a
complete
bar
to
military
prosecution
for
any
offense
committed
in
the
service
prior
to
the
time
of
discharge.
up
until
march
2,
1863,
no
statute
had
ever
been
passed
or
no
allusions
were
ever
made
either
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
the
military
would
have
jurisdiction
over
civilians.then
during
civil
war
days,
the
37th
congress
at
the
3rd
session,
the
act
of
march
2,
1863
was
passed.
the
first
section
of
that
statute
specifically
states
that
there
were
--
this
was
for
the
emergency
that
was
existing
in
time
of
war.
it
was
a
war
time
measure.
the
senator
who
introduced
the
bill
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
--
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
senator
howard,
realized
that
this
field
which
was
in
many
sections,
the
first
section
dealing
with
embezzlements
by
troops
and
officers.
second
section
providing
that
irrespective
of
discharge,
that
they
were
still
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial.
the
third
section
i
believe
called
for
the
court-martial
by
the
military
of
any
civilian
contractor
who
embezzled
from
the
united
states
and
then
there
was
another
section
providing
for
informer
privileges
and
penalties
that
would
accrue
to
a
person
committing
fraud
against
the
united
states.
the
senator
who
introduced
the
legislation
in
the
senate,
senator
howard
in
introducing
the
bill,
stated
that
there
was
a
question
concerning
whether
the
military
could
court-martial
a
civilian.
but
that
was
not
a
problem
for
the
congress.
that
was
a
problem
for
the
judiciary,
the
courts
to
decide.

to
the
statute?
i
think
it's
12
stats
at
large
696.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
and
the
allusion,
this
reference
is
made
to
the
congressional
globe.
but
we
do
not
allude
to
what
senator
howard
said.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
well,
senator
howard
in
his
statement?
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
no?
in
the
brief?
that's
at
page
32,
the
footnote
on
page
32.
now,
senator
howard
who
was
the
manager
of
the
bill,
in
arguing
the
bill
before
the
senate,
they
have
to
the
bill
stated
that
the
military
could
court-martial
any
contractor
who
did
business
with
the
army
and
any
contractor
who
did
business
with
the
army
could
--
could
be
considered
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
just
as
though
he
was
serving
in
the
army.
now,
this
act
of
march
2,
1863
is
apparently
the
strongest
stone
upon
which
the
government
relies
in
their
presentation,
saying
apparently
that
this
court
should
not
strike
down
at
this
late
date,
legislation
which
has
been
in
existence
for
some
90
years.
and
they
referred
to
the
case
of
in
re
bogart
in
the
circuit
court
in
california.
i
think
the
case
was
decided
about
1872,
which
stands
for
the
proposition
that
this
act
of
congress
was
constitutional.
in
re
bogart
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
act
of
march
2,
1863
was
constitutional.
it
also
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
military
can
court-martial
a
civilian
at
any
time,
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
act
of
congress
of
march
2,
1863
in
existence.
and
the
government
would
apparently
want
to
adopt
the
bogart
decision
or
have
this
court
adopt
the
bogart
decision
which
refers
to
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
fact
that
cases
in
the
fifth
amendment
as
the
word
is
used
in
the
exception
in
the
fifth
amendment
means
nothing
more
than
events.
but
going
back
to
this
37th
congress,
which
adopted
the
legislation,
that's
the
act
of
march
2,
1863,
they
also
as
a
part
of
that
same
legislation,
the
same
act,
the
same
statute
has
a
different
section,
leave
it
with
section
3
enacted
the
provision
that
civilians
who
did
business
with
the
army
and
who
performed
any
embezzlement
or
embezzled
any
money
from
the
united
states
would
be
court-martialed.
that
provision
was
struck
down
in
the
case
of
ex
parte
henderson
approximately
1868
and
from
that
day
to
this,
it
has
never
been
arisen
--
it's
heard
again.
now,
on
march
3,
1863,
another
statute
was
approved
which
had
been
passed
in
that
same
congress.
it
could
be
called
civil
war
draft
act,
we
will
--
that
was
its
main
tenor
and
purpose.
but
that
was
the
act
--
one
of
the
sections
of
that
act
which
also
set
up
the
very
infamous
military
commissions
which
existed
during
the
civil
war.
this
court
had
occasioned
to
consider
the
act
of
march
3,
1863
through
the
day
after
one
that
we
have
in
issue
here
or
pass
it
over
that's
in
issue
here
and
in
ex
parte
milligan
struck
down
that
statute
and
up
until
the
present
time
we
had
thought,
this
court
had
made
it
very
clear
in
ex
parte
milligan
that
the
right
of
a
civilian
citizen
of
this
country
guaranteed
him
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
could
not
be
deprived
by
any
act
of
congress
setting
up
a
military
commission
or
military
government.
the
third
point
that
we
have
before
the
court
is
the
consideration
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
itself.
we
previously
stated
to
the
court
and
stated
in
our
brief
and
was
--
as
was
ruled
by
the
district
court,
there
is
a
casus
omissus
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
article
3
(a),
which
apparently
is
the
section
of
the
code,
the
government
says
is
in
jurisdiction
provides
that
irrespective
of
discharge
or
change
of
status
that
a
soldier
shall
not
be
relieved
from
amenability
to
trial
by
courts-martial
by
reason
of
the
termination
of
said
status.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
article
3
(a)
which
permits
the
military
to
arrest,
apprehend,
or
confine
a
civilian.
when
congress
said
that
the
military
--
that
this
amenability
would
still
--
still
exist,
it
didn't
say
that
the
military
would
have
jurisdiction
to
try
a
civilian
or
the
honorably
discharged
soldier.
it
merely
used
the
loose
words
--
loose
word
“amenability.”
there's
nothing
in
there.
there's
no
article
of
--
article
3
(a)
which
says
anything
about
jurisdiction
over
a
civilian.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
states
that
what
congress
intended
by
that
was
that
discharge
would
not
be
an
absolution
for
crime.
we
can
agree
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
article
3
(a)
may
be
an
intention
of
congress,
or
a
thought
of
congress,
or
a
resolution
of
congress
that
discharge
will
not
be
an
absolution
for
crime.
but
the
recognition
that
discharge
is
not
absolution
for
crime
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
--
over
the
discharged
person.
irrespective
of
the
constitution
itself,
the
statute
in
issue
does
not
confer
jurisdiction.
the
air
force,
if
i
may
characterize
their
argument
and
their
position
throughout
this
case,
apparently
has
--
playing
the
old
shell
game
with
the
court.
they
put
three
shells
up,
article
3
(a),
article
7,
and
article
9,
and
say
--
says
to
the
court
then
to
the
court
below
and
to
the
district
court,
that
jurisdiction
over
this
civilian
is
in
these
shells.
you
pick
up
the
shell
of
article
3
(a),
not
a
reference
to
jurisdiction.it
can't
be
interpreted
to
confer
a
jurisdiction.
it
was
no
intention
in
the
language
to
confer
jurisdiction.
you
pick
up
the
shell
of
article
7.
article
7
calls
for
the
apprehension
of
various
people.
they
say
apprehension
as
defined
in
article
7
(a),
as
apprehension
is
the
taking
into
custody
of
a
person
at
simple
arrest,
the
arrest
that
we
know
in
civilian
life
that
every
police
officer
arresting
without
a
warrant
has
the
right
to
do.
article
7
(b),
any
person
authorized
under
regulations
governing
the
armed
forces
to
apprehend
persons
subject
to
this
code
or
to
trial
thereunder
may
do
so
upon
reasonable
belief
that
an
offense
has
been
committed
and
that
the
person
apprehended
committed
it.
first,
we
say
under
article
7
(b)
that
toth
a
civilian
is
not
one
of
those
persons
who
are
subject
to
this
code.
article
2
of
the
code
at
least
very
definitely
and
completely
some
12
categories
of
persons
who
are
subject
to
the
code
and
an
honorably
discharged
serviceman
is
not
listed
in
those
categories.
secondly,
article
7
(b),
if
it
could
be
stretched
to
include
the
arrest
--
arrest
or
apprehension
of
a
civilian
merely
means
exactly
what
it
says.
all
they
can
do
is
take
him
into
custody
and
then
what
can
they
do
with
him?
the
regulations
were
--
which
were
issued
under
article
7
state
that
they
must
then
turn
him
over
to
his
commanding
officer,
the
arrested
person.
that
they
cannot
do
with
toth
and
in
any
event,
article
7
has
nothing
to
do
with
jurisdiction
for
court-martial
by
jurisdiction
to
try
by
court-martial.
if
you
pick
up
the
shell
of
article
7,
you
see
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
try
a
civilian.
if
we
look
to
article
9,
article
9
defines
arrest
and
confinement.
states
article
9
(a),
confinement
is
the
physical
restraint
of
a
person.
and
that
is
what
has
been
done
with
toth
up
until
the
time
in
september
3
that
his
discharge
was
ordered
by
the
district
judge,
he
was
held
in
confinement
by
the
air
force.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
article
3
(a).
if
your
honor
pleases,
we
can
adopt
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals,
its
--
congress
intended
that
discharge
would
not
be
absolution
for
a
crime.
that's
the
declaration
of
a
policy.
that
is
our
conclusion
on
article
3
(a).
it
may
have
been
congress'
intention,
the
intention
of
congress
to
confer
jurisdiction
over
a
discharged
serviceman.
but
with
all
due
respect
to
the
congress,
they
didn't
do
so
and
that
is
our
position
with
respect
to
that.
if
you
examine
the
three
articles
in
question,
which
are
the
only
articles
that
the
air
force
can
rely
on,
look
at
each
one
of
them,
you'll
see
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
court-martial
this
civilian.
and
the
--
in
its
brief,
the
government
practically
concedes
that
as
reference
to
commanding
officer
in
article
9
that
toth
cannot
have
a
commanding
officer.
he
is
a
civilian.
he
has
no
commanding
officer.
they
say,
“where
will
we
find
the
commanding
officer?”
you
will
look
to
the
regulations.
but
they
did
not
cite
a
regulation.
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
there
are
no
the
regulations
which
would
permit
the
confinement
or
trial
of
toth.
we
also
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
the
president
has
no
authority
to
promulgate
any
such
regulation
or
regulations.
the
authority
is
not
given
to
the
president
and
it
is
the
congress
who
has
the
authority
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
under
--
when
this
act
of
congress
is
broadly
looked
at,
the
court
will
see
that
congress
is
devoid
of
authority
under
section
1
of
the
constitution
to
enact
any
legislation
that
would
look
to
court-martial
of
a
civilian.
when
we
look
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment,
we'd
see
that
there
is
a
complete
bar
to
the
court-martial
and
deprivation
of
the
right
of
a
civilian.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
can
be
interpreted
that
way
and
i
think
that
is
the
reasonable
interpretation
to
name.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
that's
right.
of
course
toth
was
not
connected
with
the
military
and
had
no
commanding
officer,
and
was
subject
to
no
commanding
officer.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
not
at
the
time
his
confinement
was
ordered,
if
your
honor
please.
he
was
in
pittsburgh.
now
--
oh,
you
mean,
was
there
a
commanding
officer
in
charge
of
pittsburgh?
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
i've
misunderstood
your
original
question,
your
honor.
there
are
civilians
who
are
affiliated
with
the
armed
forces
such
as
a
camp
follower
type
that
a
person
who
signs
a
contract
with
the
army
could
go
to
korea
and
perform
some
engineering
functions
or
something
like
that
sort.
they
are
subject
to
a
commanding
officer
when
they're
working
in
that
particular
area.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
that
is
the
type
of
civilian
i
thought
your
honor
had
referenced
to.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's
like
saying
as
i
stand
before
your
honor
this
morning
as
a
civilian
that
the
commandant
of
a
military
district
of
washington
is
my
commanding
officer
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
he
has
absolutely
no
authority
over
me.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
but
the
only
persons
that
he
can
command
in
this
area
are
people
in
uniform,
subject
to
his
command.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
in
that
sense,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
when
we
look
again
at
the
uniform
code
as
the
board
of
act
of
congress,
if
we
can
call
it
that,
this
business
of
concurring
jurisdiction
to
try
and
honorably
discharged
serviceman
and
the
deprivation
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments,
i
believe
the
best
example
that
we
have
of
that
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
--
absolutely
no
provision
in
the
code
for
admission
to
bail.
if
we
examine
this
case,
unless
the
district
court
at
the
time
the
government
indicated
its
intention
to
appeal,
had
put
toth
on
a
bail
bond,
an
appeal
bond
he
would
still
be
held
in
confinement
for
some
two
years
by
the
air
force,
no
means
of
livelihood,
no
means
of
supporting
his
family,
no
means
of
hiring
attorneys
or
counsel,
no
means
even
of
buying
cigarettes,
has
no
money
at
all.
now,
the
--
as
my
understanding,
i
don't
have
a
citation
to
the
case
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
before
it
a
soldier,
man
in
service
who
is
requesting
the
right
of
bail,
no
provision
in
the
code.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
there's
no
necessity
for
any
such
provision
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
because
the
soldier
doesn't
need
bail.
he
is
receiving
his
pay
when
he
is
in
confinement.
his
family,
if
he's
--
if
he's
supporting
his
family
from
his
pay,
is
being
taken
care
of.
he
is
being
fed.
he
is
being
clothed.
his
insurance
and
all
his
other
benefits
that
he
gets
as
a
serviceman
keep
accruing
to
him
when
he's
in
confinement
awaiting
trial.
he
is
much
different
than
a
civilian.
not
only
that,
but
he
doesn't
need
money
for
attorneys.
attorneys
are
appointed
by
the
service
involved.
so
all
the
benefits
that
a
civilian
would
get
by
being
allowed
to
go
free
on
bail,
the
soldier
is
not
deprived
of
that,
other
than
his
freedom
and
that
is
apparently
was
not
important
to
the
court
of
military
appeals.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
--
that
one
little
example,
the
fact
that
congress
would
not
have
a
section
in
here
permitting
an
honorably
discharged
civilian
to
go
free
on
bail
pending
the
time
of
trial
shows
that
this
legislation
was
not
well
fought
out
and
that
article
3
(a)
does
not
serve
the
purpose
which
the
government
says
that
it
does.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
of
course,
if
your
honor
pleases,
if
we
hadn't
prevailed
in
the
district
court,
he
would
not
be
on
bail
now.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
i
believe
i
may
shed
some
light
on
this
article
9
(c),
that
the
authority
to
order
persons
into
arrest
or
confinement
may
not
be
delegated.
the
regulations
which
were
issued
under
the
code
of
president
truman,
regulation
21
(a)
defines
commanding
officer
as
a
reference
to
that
regulation
and
the
definition
of
commanding
officer
in
our
brief.
the
secretary
of
the
service
involved
is
not
a
commanding
officer.
he
is
not
defined
as
such.
the
--
when
the
--
this
article
9
(c)
refers
to
officers,
warrant
officers
and
civilians.
and
it
has
to
be
the
superior
officer,
of
the
officer
involved,
who
orders
him
into
arrest
which
means
that
it's
a
moral
persuasion
that
he
stays
in
his
quarters
or
orders
him
confined.
a
captain,
for
example,
who
was
ordering
a
lieutenant
into
arrest
cannot
delegate
that
chore
to
a
subordinate
officer.
it
has
to
be
a
superior
officer
to
the
officer
being
arrested
or
confined
who
performs
that
task.
now,
of
course
when
he's
going
to
confine
another
officer,
he
can
order
that
--
enlisted
personnel
will
actually
escort
him
to
the
jail
or
the
penitentiary,
wherever
they're
taking
him.
and
i
believe
if
that
that's
what
that
means
and
it's
most
peculiarly
applicable
to
toth
because
he
had
no
commanding
officer
who
could
delegate
any
power
to
anyone.
now,
going
back
to
the
original
argument
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
would
gather
from
his
argument
that
he
said
the
commander
of
the
fifth
air
force
in
korea
would
be
toth's
commanding
officer
at
the
time
this
arrest
was
ordered.
toth
was
in
pittsburg,
the
--
fifth
air
force
commander
had
no
authority
outside
of
the
korea
or
korean
area.
now,
the
acting
secretary
of
the
air
force
consented
to
his
arrest
or
his
apprehension
and
ordered
the
air
provost
marshal
to
affect
his
apprehension,
or
as
he
put
it
to
offset
his
apprehension.
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
air
provost
marshal
had
no
connection
as
a
commanding
officer
to
toth
and
under
the
regulations
issued
pursuant
to
the
code,
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
could
not
be
considered
a
commanding
officer.
the
solicitor
general
has
alluded
to
the
fact
that
toth
had
all
the
fair
hearings
and
preliminary
inquiries
that
were
necessary
and
that
he
would
have
received
as
a
civilian.
the
record
in
the
case
indicate
that
the
time
these
accusations
were
filed
against
toth,
four
men,
three
in
the
service
and
toth
out
of
the
service
were
accused
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder.
after
toth
was
escorted
from
pittsburg
to
korea,
one
of
these
men,
sergeant
kenneth
bogard
was
exculpated.
he
never
stood
court-martial
charges.
it
was
determined
upon
investigation
that
he
was
not
guilty,
that
was
after
the
fact
of
toth
being
transported
from
pittsburg
to
korea
that
the
investigation
started
to
determine
whether
there
was
reasonable
grounds
to
hold
him.
there
was
no
determination
prior
to
his
transportation
to
korea
or
whether
or
not
there
was
reasonable
grounds
to
hold
him.
now,
to
--
there's
a
reference
made
to
what
happened
to
the
other
two
men,
lieutenant
schreiber,
who
is
supposed
to
have
ordered
this
killing
and
airman
kinder,
who
was
suppose
to
pull
the
trigger.
as
we
advised
the
court
before,
those
cases
went
up
through
the
uniform
--
under
the
code,
went
up
to
the
court
of
military
appeal.
at
the
time
of
the
last
argument
we
advised
the
court
that
lieutenant
kinder
received
the
two-year
sentence,
he
was
the
triggerman
and
that
he
is
sentenced
and
subsequently
then
commuted
and
he
was
discharged
from
the
service.
schreiber's
conviction
was
upheld
by
the
military
court
of
appeals,
this
is
in
their
records
in
their
cases
some
time
last
may,
within
a
week
after
his
sentence,
according
to
my
information
was
confirmed.
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
commuted
his
sentence
and
gave
him
a
dishonorable
discharge,
and
permitted
him
to
leave
the
service,
and
i
think
he
left
the
service
on
may
18,
1955
having
served
approximately
18
to
20
months.
this
is
not
a
heinous
crime
that
this
man
has
been
charged
with.
i
think
that
the
treatment
by
the
air
force
revealed
that
fact.
now,
the
solicitor
general
would
also
infer
that
there
is
due
process
and
all
the
constitutional
guarantees
were
much
of
them
as
a
necessary
are
engendered
within
this
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
and
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
examine
the
code.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
code
be
examined
too
because
you
will
see
upon
examination
of
the
code
that
the
entire
purpose
is
summary
punishment,
discipline
in
the
rank,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
justice,
justice
is
not
meant
to
be
dispensed
there.
for
instance,
every
serious
offense
involving
more
than
a
year
in
--
imprisonment
is
automatically
reviewed
under
the
code.
why
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
it
is
true
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
it's
an
advancement
beyond
what
military
justice
was
before.
but
your
honor
--
for
example,
your
honor,
for
offenses
involving
a
sentence
of
more
than
a
year,
there's
an
automatic
review
by
the
services
involved.
the
sole
purpose
of
that
review
is
to
make
sure
that
the
man
in
the
navy,
who
may
have
been
sentenced
by
the
court-martial
to
five
years
imprisonment
for
being
awol
for
10
days,
doesn't
receive
a
greater
sentence
than
the
man
in
the
air
force
who
may
have
received
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
your
honor,
perhaps
you've
misinterpreted
--
interpreted
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
--
what
i've
said.
i
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
i
say
that
the
purpose
of
a
court-martial
and
that's
been
the
--
in
the
history
of
this
entire
country.
the
purpose
of
the
court-martial
is
not
to
dispense
justice.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
to
the
people
in
the
military.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
the
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
but
the
purpose
of
the
court-martial
in
the
military
is
to
have
summary
punishment
and
to
discipline
the
troops.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
what
effect
does
it
have
on
anybody
else
in
the
service?
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
if
--
if
that's
--
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
the
man
in
the
service
already
knows
that
if
he
commits
murder,
he'll
be
held
to
answer
for
it.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
well,
apparently
from
the
founding
of
our
country
up
until
1950,
it
was
never
thought
to
be
important
that
it
--
to
maintain
discipline
in
the
ranks
that
they
had
to
have
such
statute.
mr.
william
a.
kehoe,
jr.
perhaps
you're
right,
your
honor.
there's
one
other
reference
i'd
like
to
make
and
that
is
to
the
effect
of
how
this
code
will
affect
people
in
this
country.
we're
all
familiar
with
the
draft
act,
so
we
know
that
young
men
in
the
country
are
being
drafted
everyday.
ultimately,
this
code
will
affect
every
able
bodied
male
in
the
country.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
opinion
over
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
