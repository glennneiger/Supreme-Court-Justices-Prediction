justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
your
answer
is
for
me,
to
be
conclusive
if
our
problem
here
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
take
care
of
what
you
say
in
the
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
specific
provision,
that's
where
the
difference
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
the
question
is
what
the
exception
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
it
would
prove
the
argument
that
you
so
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
might
--
you
might
then
show
me
that
if
this
is
not
such
as
a
common
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
--
they're
not
dealing
with
a
very
important
power
of
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
got
the
document
in
this
very
case,
maybe
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
happens
merely
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happened
before
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
that
what
--
what
was
on
the
piece
of
paper
to
which
the
name
of
the
then
secretary
of
the
air
at
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
does
(inaudible)
did
he
originated
or
his
company
in
korea
said
we
want
this
fellow
and
that
has
to
go
before
the
secretary
of
the
air
to
get
his
approval.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
his
attention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
got
his
personal
signature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
second
--
this
is
the
second
time
you've
made
that
remark.
can
it
fairly
be
said
however
summary
or
whatever
limitations
there
may
be,
there
maybe
on
--
under
the
military
code,
that
justice
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
their
opinions
in
their
reversals
for
things
--
of
convictions
that
never
would
have
been
reversed
in
kingdom
come
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
well
aware
of
the
--
i'm
well
aware
of
the
fact
as
everybody
is
that
courts-martial
do
not
have
what
a
state
does,
as
a
federal
bill
of
rights,
a
requirement
or
subsequent
law.
and
our
question
is
(inaudible)
with
its
limitation
can
be
applied
to
this
kind
of
(inaudible)
constitutionally.
but
i
do
not
see
why
you
have
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
deny
there
being
what
has
been
a
great
advance
and
what
on
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
a
very
civilized
form
of
dealing
with
military
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
saying
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
to
dispense
justice
in
relation
to
the
military
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
