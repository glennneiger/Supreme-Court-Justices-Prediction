justice

mr.
kehoe,
while
you're
on
that
section,
that
article
9
and
the
commanding
officer,
the
language
doesn't
say
confinement
by
his
commanding
officer,
it
says
by
a
commanding
officer
to
whose
authority
he
is
subject.
is
that
a
possible
interpretation
as
a
commanding
officer
in
a
military
field
who
has
authority
over
a
civilian
could
maybe
in
his
area?
justice
harold
burton
so
he
doesn't
have
to
have
his
commanding
officer?
a
commanding
officer
has
authority
there?
justice
harold
burton
no,
but
he
was
a
civilian
who
was
in
the
area
that
did
have
a
commanding
officer?
justice
harold
burton
no,
the
commanding
officer
that
had
authority
over
the
jail
or
to
whatever
it
may
--
it
might
be
if
he
was
around
the
area.
i
mean,
the
point
that
i
was
making,
they
continually
said
that
he
had
no
commanding
officer.
well,
i
suppose
a
civilian
doesn't
have
a
commanding
officer,
a
commanding
--
but
a
civilian
is
subject
to
the
authority
of
a
commanding
officer
in
the
area
where
the
civilian
happens
to
be.
justice
harold
burton
there
is
--
justice
harold
burton
no,
i'm
talking
about
an
ordinary
civilian
but
he
happens
to
be
on
a
military
reservation
made
a
civilian
and
there
is
a
commanding
officer
there
who
has
authority
over
the
area.
and
i
thought
that
might
be
what
this
is
talking
about
rather
than
talking
about
his
having
a
commanding
officer
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
well,
the
--
the
commanding
officer
of
the
military
district
here
is
not
your
commanding
officer.
he
is
a
commanding
officer
of
this
area.
you
happened
to
be
here
and
on
a
certain
subject,
if
you
went
over
in
his
front
yard,
you'll
be
subject
to
his
authority.
justice
harold
burton
but
if
you
find
yourself
over
on
his
front
porch,
well
then
you're
in
an
area
that's
subject
to
his
authority?
justice
harold
burton
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
harold
burton
there's
quite
a
number
of
--
of
which
there
are
no
limitations
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
now,
commanding
officer,
as
mr.
justice
burton
pointed
out,
does
not
mean
the
man
who
at
the
time
of
the
war,
time
of
battle
in
giving
the
orders.
a
commanding
officer
means
a
commanding
officer
--
an
officer
who
is
in
command
in
that
situation
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
order.
this
code
provides
for
the
issuance
of
an
authority
to
arrest,
an
order
of
arrest
by
the
acting
--
by
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
in
person.
that's
a
safeguard
so
that
not
every
tom,
dick
and
harry
under
service
can
undertake
to
do
it.
and
as
in
other
situations,
he
issues
it
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
fifth
air
force
whatever
it
was,
and
the
authority
is
delegated
from
officer
to
officer
until
you
get
the
arresting
squad.
you
have
the
same
thing
in
civil
law.
justice
harold
burton
the
commanding
officer
--
justice
harold
burton
general,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
article
3
has
the
effect
of
limiting
the
discharge
from
an
absolute
to
a
condition
of
discharge?
the
government
could
have
a
hold
on
him?
justice
harold
burton
what?
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
is
a
theory
that
--
that
--
of
course,
the
statute
doesn't
put
it
in
those
words
but
that
would
be
the
theory
and
it's
not
an
irrational
extension.nobody
could
say
it's
an
irrational
extension
when
these
four
countries
that
i
have
mentioned
with
english
speaking
jurisprudence
have
thought
it's
fair
to
make
that
provision.
justice
harold
burton
is
it
a
dangerous
thing?
justice
harold
burton
well,
do
you
consider
discipline
applied
only
to
mr.
toth
himself?
if
toth
were
--
were
convicted
wouldn't
that
be
a
disciplinary
measure
to
the
other
people
who
are
still
in
the
service?
