i

i
was
wondering
if

if
they
meant

why
wouldn't
they
say
the
secretary
of
the

instead
of

but
is
there
anything

chief

--
would
it
be
applicable
to
this
particular
case?
chief

presumably,
that
would
mean
for
the

whoever?
chief

then
does

got

with

haven't
they
attempted

do
--
chief

--
the
same
thing
with

chief

i
thought
they
said

--
that
all
those

were

well,
what
is
that
--
chief

i
hope
not.
chief

but
general,
does

i

i'd
like

chief

well,
maybe
not
just
because
he
was
a
contractor
but
because
he
was
there
with
the

there
with
the
army.
chief

a
contractor,
who
was
out
in
the
field,
who
did
some
of
the
work,
i
suppose
he
would
be.
the
man
who
--
with

of

persons,

of

civilians,
the

so
that
any

is

around

during

affair
could
now
we
brought
back
to
korea
and
tried
by
a
court-martial?
chief

just
wondering
if
you
made
any
--
chief
justice
earl

--
differentiation?
chief
justice
earl

well,
that
wouldn't
prove

does
it?

according
to
your
information,

he
was

he

he
can

if
notwithstanding

--
chief

well,
no,

here
comes
forth
a

chief

but
general
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
bothered
me,
those
sections
can
be
tailor-made
to
this
situation
provided
for
arrest,
provided
for
detention
and
confinement
but
i
didn't
see
anything
about
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
consent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
consent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
now
say
that
the
commanding
officer
who's
referred
to
in
7
(c)
is
the
secretary
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
9
(c)
is
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
is
the
secretary
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
i'm
interested
in
is
finding
how
--
who
designates
this
commanding
officer?
who
is
he?
is
he
the
secretary
for
air
or
is
he
someone
that
the
secretary
for
air
or
somebody
under
him
designates
to
say
it's
not
the
commanding
officer
of
this
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
not
the
commanding
officer
of
the
place
where
the
crime
was
committed,
it
is
a
commanding
officer.
now,
who
designates?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
what
--
what
is
the
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
secretary
orders
him
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
section
of
the
code
requires
the
secretary
for
air
to
order
the
arrest
of
this
man?
i
thought
you've
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
read
that
he
must
consent
to
it,
not
that
he
must
order
it
but
he
must
consent
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
he
is
the
commanding
officer
who
is
referred
to
in
9
(c)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
last
sentence
says
the
authority
to
order
such
persons
into
arrest
or
confinement
may
not
be
delegated.
so
whoever
this
commanding
officer
is,
he
can't
delegate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
--
who
is
referred
to
when
it
says
he
cannot
delegate?
who
cannot
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl

who
cannot
delegate?

justice

thank
you,
general.
