mr.
--
solicitor
general,
the
problem
comes
here
(inaudible)
and
whether
you
like
it
or
don't
like
it,
the
question
of
power
of
congress
(voice

justice
stanley
reed
now,
that
--
that
means
that
it
comes
under
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

arising
in
the
land
and
naval
forces?
justice
stanley
reed
so
your
point
of
view
as
i
understand
it
comes
down
to
the
problems
of
when
this
case
--
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
when
the
crime
is
committed.
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
go
back
the
last
--
the
last
sentence
of
(c)
on
your
page
41.
the
authority
to
order
such
a
person
may
not
be
delegated.
surely
it's
possible
that
general
eisenhower
when
he's
the
commander
of
the
forces
in
europe,
had
to
pass
on
the
arrest
of
every
officer.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
thought
you
said
this
could
only
be
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
done
by
the
secretary
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
of
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
but
this
--
this
(c)
is
general,
it's
not
limited
to
--
to
3
(a),
the
regulation
is
limited
to
3
(a).
justice
stanley
reed
but
(c)
is
the
general
provision
that
applies
to
every
officer
of
the
grade
of
second
lieutenant
up
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
and
that
the
second
lieutenant
couldn't
be
ordered
to
arrest
by
general
eisenhower
whether
he's
commander
in
europe?
justice
stanley
reed
so
am
i,
and
that's
the
reason
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
perhaps
you
could
give
us
a
memorandum.
justice
stanley
reed
it
may
have
been
because
he
was
not
