you
--
you
seem
to
indicate
that
it's
obvious,
that
matter
of
course,
the
fellow
might
(inaudible)
suppose
this
one
from
california
but
not
in
new
mexico.
why
is
that
so
obvious
that
we
do
not
here
see
it
all
because
what
--
what
this
act
does
eventually
is
to
give
vital
instructions
that
you
can
come
up
with
against
the
united
states
(inaudible)
in
a
place
where
it
is
going
--
where
that
occurred?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
is
it
so
terrible
to
think
that
in
--
if
california
has
a
special
document
read
by
a
man
who
is
(inaudible)
it
means
subjection
of
that
report
(inaudible)
your
application
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
we're
confident
with
just
this
one,
why
that
simply
--
why
is
so
terrible
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
so
terrible
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
shouldn't
they
as
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
congress
will
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
a
question
of
different
types
of
employment
relations,
it's
a
question
of
what
little
significance
to
follow
from
(inaudible)
in
one
situation
against
another.
and
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
i
think
it
was
a
very
a
minded
(inaudible)
a
very
versatile
body
that
we
can't
tell
what
they
might
think
if
they
really
had
to
think
when
the
statute
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
how
do
we
get
--
where
would
we
get
this
general
law,
what
is
brought
in
employment.
still
it's
federal
law,
where
do
we
get
it
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
be
broad
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
during
the
erie
and
tompkins.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
erie
and
tompkins
hasn't
rejected
undesirability
of
that
and
now
to
use
it
(inaudible)
connection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
