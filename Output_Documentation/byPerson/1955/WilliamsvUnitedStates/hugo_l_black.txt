justice

l.
black
was
he
a
soldier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
sent
him
out
for
recreation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
if
the
government
assumed
the
risk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
is
that
an
unprecedented
kind
of
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
are
many
(inaudible)
i
think.
i
happen
to
note
some
of
them
that's
--
have
camps
for
their
employees.
they
transport
their
employees
to
those
camps
solely
for
recreational
purpose.
if
they
had
an
accident,
and
run
over
someone,
would
they
happen
to
be
liable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
instead
of
turning
an
authorized
truck
driver,
he
just
turned
it
over
to
half-a-dozen
of
them,
say,
even
let
either
one
driver
that
wished
it
to
drive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
that
we
don't
have
--
we
--
we
send
out
people
on
this
trip
for
recreational
purpose.
and
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
one
of
the
drivers
who
didn't
start
off
with
it
runs
over
somebody
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
they
be
liable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
get
back
to
the
question
of
authorization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now
you
are
raising
a
question
which
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
whether
you're
acting
in
the
line
and
scope
of
his
employ.
that
you
are
there
raising
the
question
that
he
--
there
was
no
authorized
use
for
recreational
purpose?
that
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
this
was
authorized,
let's
suppose
that
his
statement
was
true
and
full
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
we
don't
have
to
suppose
he
is
authorized
to
get
drunk.
let's
suppose
he
was
authorized
to
take
the
car
out,
to
go
on
a
recreational
trip
to
take
half-a-dozen
others
if
he
wanted
to
and
one
of
them
could
drive
and
that's
customary.
and
they
then
run
over
somebody.
would
you
say
that
he
was
not
acting
within
the
line
and
scope
of
his
employment
if
he's
authorized
by
the
commanding
officers
to
take
that
trip
for
that
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
governed
by
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
on
what
do
they
base
that?
aren't
there
a
number
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
aren't
there
a
number
of
states
that
hold
that
the
question
of
deviation
from
the
--
from
the
task
which
the
employer
has
imposed
to
the
employee
to
take
is
not
a
matter
that
can
be
put
within
sharp
definition,
but
determined
by
the
circumstance
and
left
for
the
circumstances
in
this
particular
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
get
back
then
to
the
question
of
whether
he
was
authorized,
and
if
--
why
would
it
not
be
an
official
mission
if
they
authorized
for
recreational
purpose,
soldiers
who
take
this,
go
to
places
anywhere
they'd
be
within
the
limits.
that
was
a
part
of
the
program
of
the
army.
why
would
it
not
be
an
--
an
authorized
purpose
to
go
there
and
why
do
you
say
that
that
wouldn't
be
for
an
official
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
question
of
fact?
a
certain
question
of
fact?
