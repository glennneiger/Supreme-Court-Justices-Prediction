personnel
to
use
the
trucks
after

working
hours
in
a
day
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
this
limited
places
of
amusements
such
as
this
camp.
and
if
this
man
drank
as
many

do
at
such
---
such
places
and
had
this
accident,

you
say
that
that
would
change
the
situation?

on
whether
this
situation
is
controlled
by
federal
or
state
law.

you
--
would
you
give
us
a
precise
answer
to
that?
