mr.
henry
c.
clausen
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
involves
also
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
situation
is
that
i
represent
the
plaintiff
who
was
injured
while
she
was
sitting
in
a
parked
automobile
at
agana
on
guam.
the
accident
happened
about
10:30
at
night.
a
--
an
army
corporal
named
seabourn
was
driving
an
army
truck,
crashed
into
the
plaintiffs
automobile
and
caused
her
very
serious
and
permanent
injuries.
the
negligence
and
the
injuries
are
admitted.
the
sole
question
really
here
is
whether
at
the
time
of
the
accident
the
corporal,
seabourn,
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
or
the
line
of
duty
as
set
forth
and
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
facts
preceding
were
that
the
accident
happened
at
10:30
pm.
at
about
10
--
and
about
8
o'clock
that
night,
the
corporal,
in
accordance
with
army
custom,
that
is
custom
that
have
been
prevalent
on
this
post
on
guam
had
gotten
a
so-called
trip
ticket
made
out
for
official
business.
in
accordance
with
the
custom,
the
trip
tickets
made
out
for
official
business
where
the
means
by
which
the
army
personnel
would
secure
a
vehicle
for
recreation
purposes.
and
the
--
this
vehicle
on
the
night
in
question,
after
the
corporal,
seabourn
had
gotten
the
vehicle,
was
checked-out
for
that
purpose
namely
recreation
to
drive
himself
and
two
other
army
men
named,
schmidt
and
vincent
for
recreation.
the
evidence
showed
at
the
motor
pool
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
at
the
motor
pool,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
that's
the
custom.
and
incidentally,
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
sergeant
stiles
was
excluded
on
motion
of
the
court.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
dispatcher,
your
honor,
the
evidence
on
the
dispatcher,
the
record
on
page
30
--
31,
the
--
the
--
answering
your
honors
question,
there
the
custom,
your
honor,
was
to
get
a
trip
ticket
made
out
for
official
business.
that's
the
type
of
trip
ticket
and
to
use
that
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
vehicle
to
drive
for
recreation.
in
other
words,
the
trip
tickets
were
all
made
out
for
official
business
but
the
men
would
use
those
for
the
purpose
of
driving
the
vehicle
for
recreation.
that
was
the
custom.
the
officers
on
this
particular
post
had
two
jeeps.
they
were
available
to
the
men
three
of
these
trucks.
now,
the
post
there,
so
the
court
may
understand
guam
and
the
post,
the
town
of
agana
is
situated
some
distance
from
the
post,
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
a
vehicle
to
go
for
recreation.
for
example
to
the
non-commissioned
officers'
club
which
the
man
did
on
this
night
in
question
preceding
the
accident.
the
place
of
their
recreation
into
which
they
went
was
from
the
post
to
the
non-commissioned
officers'
club.
there,
as
the
fact
showed,
the
men
drank.
the
corporal,
seabourn,
the
driver
at
this
non-commissioned
officers'
club,
drank
to
excess
and
to
such
an
excess
that
he
in
driving
them
from
the
non-commissioned
officers'
club
to
agana,
caused
his
two
companions
to
want
to
leave
him,
they
got
out.
schmidt
and
vincent
got
out.
and
then
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
this
girl
was
hit
when
she
was
in
the
automobile
so
far
as
seabourn,
the
corporal,
remembers.
now,
the
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
the
custom
had
been
in
practice
there
for
18
months
preceding
this
and
as
i
state,
the
officers
had
for
themselves
two
jeeps,
the
man
had
the
three
trucks
for
the
purpose
of
recreation.
and
again
i
point
out
that
when
i'm
saying
recreation,
i'm
putting
the
setting
of
this
recreation
not
in
the
united
states,
although
the
murphey
case
is
applicable
for
--
in
connection
with
our
northern
district
of
california
in
the
town
of
klamath.
but
here
is
an
island
outpost
where
the
men
are
cooped
up,
where
the
island
itself
is
34
miles
long
by
some
four
to
10
miles
wide
whereby
reason
of
the
overseas
status
of
the
men,
they
are
on
duty
24
hours
a
day.
and
where
--
where
it
is
necessary,
i
point
out
again,
to
have
vehicles
to
get
about.
in
any
event
the
--
the
basic
error
in
my
opinion
here
was
when
the
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
failed
to
apply
the
rule
of
respondeat
superior
which
is
the
law
of
california.
now,
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
contention
that
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
law
which
governs
is
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
--
where
the
accident
occurred.
in
this
case,
it
was
guam
and
the
code
of
guam,
specifically
section
2338
of
their
guamanian
code
incorporates
the
same
numbered
section
of
the
california
civil
code
which
adopts
the
common
law
doctrine
of
a
respondeat
superior.
and
therefore,
it
is
our
contention
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
law
to
be
applied
would
have
been
the
california
law
and
which
was
applied
in
the
johnson
case
and
which
was
applied
in
the
murphey
case,
two
prior
decisions
of
our
own
circuit
held.
i
--
i
say
therefore,
the
--
and
i'll
just
briefly
read
the
--
the
trial
court
rendered
an
opinion.
it
was
the
belief
of
the
trial
court
and
it
says
here,
even
assuming
that
the
practice,
this
practice
to
which
i've
adverted
testified
to
by
seabourn
and
schmidt
was
known
and
permitted
by
the
officer
in
charge,
it
would
not
make
the
united
states
liable.
the
sovereign
can
not
be
sued
without
its
consent
but
by
the
tort's
claim
of
--
claims
act
of
united
states
has
consented
to
be
sued
for
the
negligence
of
its
employees
only
when
they
are
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
and
then
the
court
says
federal
law
in
decisions
control
similarly
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
goes
on
to
say.
but
in
dealing
with
the
problem
of
federal
liability
for
tortious
acts
of
members
of
the
military
and
naval
forces
a
wholly
different
situation
is
presented
because
congress
saw
fit
to
adopt
the
drastic
modification
of
the
master
and
servant
doctrine.
now,
it
is
my
contention
that
that
is
--
is
--
does
violence
to
the
act
itself
because
the
act
states
that
their
claims
for
personal
injury
caused
by
the
negligent
or
wrongful
act
or
omission
of
the
employee
of
the
government
while
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
--
of
the
employment
are
permissible
if
a
private
person
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
the
omission
occurred.
and
that
has
been
so
held
by
my
own
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
johnson
and
the
murphey
cases.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
johnson
case,
which
was
a
case
of
1950,
involved
guam
also.
there,
the
injured
person
suffered
an
injury
while
riding
in
a
navy
reconverted
ambulance
driven
by
a
navy
chief
petty
officer.
and
the
fact
showed
that
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
he
was
on
a
deviation.
he
had
deviated
from
his
regular
assignment
which
was
to
deliver
a
report.
but
the
court
held
that
this
--
here
he
was
primarily
motivated
by
his
own
desire
to
serve
the
master
according
to
the
respondeat
theory
and
by
reason
of
this
deviation,
it
nevertheless
granted
the
master
liable.
now,
the
court
further
pointed
out
on
this
johnson
case,
181
f.2d
577,
that
california
law
controls
in
guam
and
that
the
same
scope
and
significance
should
be
given
the
law
as
applied
to
the
military
in
guam
as
would
be
given
under
the
california
courts.
furthermore,
that
where
this
driver
did
combine
with
his
business
for
the
master
the
--
his
own
personal
business,
nevertheless,
the
master
will
be
made
liable
when
third
persons
are
hurt.
and
moreover
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
man
was
driving
a
government
vehicle
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
a
government
employee
on
the
issue
of
--
of
authority
to
drive
does
justify
the
inference
that
there
was
authority
and
so
that
even
though
there
was
a
departure,
a
personal
errand
of
himself,
the
government
was
liable.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
he
was
assigned,
your
honor,
to
drive
the
truck
but
he
was
not
assigned
to
cut
the
hair
of
the
man.
in
other
words,
he
deviated
to
go
and
cut
the
hair
of
two
men
that
he
casually
met
at
some
club
or
off
to
enlisted
man's
place
and
that's
the
job
he
was
on
when
the
accident
happened.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
i
beg,
your
honors,
pardon?
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
well,
if
the
court
the
please.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
but
if
the
court
please,
under
the
california
law,
you
not
only
have
this
motivation
deviation
aspect
but
you
have
the
realm
of
the
risk.
in
other
words,
if
the
master
has
reasonable
cause,
if
he
has
a
reasonable
ground
that
he
can
foresee.
other
words,
if
the
master
may
foresee
what
will
happen,
if
the
master
permits
an
employee
to
drive
an
automobile
that
he
then
in
california,
your
honors,
held
liable.
the
court
in
the
johnson
case
discusses
that
aspect,
the
court
in
the
murphey
case
discusses
that
aspect.
in
other
words,
when
we
thought
of
a
--
of
vicarious
responsibility
for
--
or
liability
rather
in
the
respondeat
theory
aspect,
there
are
two
--
two
hazards
which
a
master
should
bear
in
mind.
one
is,
that
his
employee
may
deviate
and
may
ask
demand
to
deliver
a
report
as
in
the
johnson
case
when
you
must
realize
that
he
may
deviate.
another,
your
honor,
is
that
the
master
ought
to
foresee
the
probability
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
the
zone
of
the
risk
is
important
also
and
is
not
a
facet.
here,
your
honor,
if
i
may
just
advert
to
my
own
case,
seabourn
is
a
soldier,
he
is
a
corporal
and
certainly,
if
uncle
sam
lets
him
take
the
car
to
go
to
an
nco
club,
a
non-commissioned
officers'
club
and
there
drink.
then
the
united
states,
as
the
master,
should
foresee
that
the
soldier
will
drink
to
excess.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
they
sent
him
down
for
recreation
and
your
honor
there
i
am
a
piece
on
the
island
of
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
a
corporal
in
the
air
corps,
seabourn
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
well,
your
honor,
the
improvement
of
morale
in
the
army
includes
recreation.
now,
of
course
the
army
did
not
send
him
out
to
drink
to
excess
but
on
an
island
outpost
or
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
involving
the
klamath
case,
that's
not
klamath
falls,
oregon
but
klamath,
california.
it
was
held,
that
the
morale
of
a
soldier
and
its
peculiar
to
the
military
is
important.
and
for
that
purpose,
when
there
is
a
--
for
that
purpose,
it
is
permissible
to
--
to
give
to
the
soldiers
vehicles
for
recreation.
now,
then
here
on
guam,
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
they
sent
him
out
for
recreation.
he
went
with
their
permission
for
recreation.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
under
the
california
law,
respondeat
theory,
he
--
he
--
the
--
or
rather
if
the
government
is
responsible.
now,
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
your
honor.
not
always
although
he
is
on
duty
24
hours
a
day
in
guam.
now
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
now
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
well,
his
action
would
be
in
the
line
of
duty
as
contemplated
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act
at
this
instance
because,
your
honor,
in
addition
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
always
but
more
so
in
this
case
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
not,
your
honor
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
i
don't
say
that,
your
honor.
what
i
say
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
soldier
was
on
24
hours
duty
if
--
but
in
addition,
your
honor,
he
had
been
given
a
pass.
he
--
he
in
this
case,
the
soldier
had
been
given
a
pass
and
of
course
that
pass
was
recreation.
he
was
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no.
he
had
a
pass,
your
honor,
to
go
off
base
and
then
in
addition
to
that
he
had
a
truck
to
go
off
base.
he
had
gotten,
your
honor,
according
to
custom,
a
truck
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
exactly.
and
in
california,
your
honor,
you
can
show
that
the
negligent
giving
or
rather
i'll
put
it
this
way.
you
can
show
authority
to
drive
an
automobile
may
be
founded
upon
custom
and
exactly
in
this
case
because
here
for
18
months,
the
man
had
gotten
trip
tickets.
they
read
that
they
were
for
official
business
but
the
men
got
them
that
night
and
used
these
trip
tickets
to
take
the
car
or
the
automobile
off
post
and
that
would
be
the
only
place
they
could
go
would
--
would
be
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
seabourn
and
schmidt
both
testified
to
this
custom
and
that
as
i
have
stated
that
the
custom
was
in
operation
for
18
months.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
i'll
put
it
this
way,
your
honor,
that
there
was
--
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
--
is
correct.
there
--
there
was
no
denial.
the
--
the
custom
was
shown.
there
was
--
there
was
an
attempt
to
put
in
evidence
a
deposition
which
in
some
way
might
dilute,
might
tend
to
dilute
the
custom
but
that
deposition
was
stricken
from
the
file.
now,
that
was
obviously
an
attempt
of
this
sergeant
stiles
to
perhaps
exculpate
himself.
but
the
fact
nevertheless
was
the
custom
was
in
operation
there
on
this
post
for
18
months
and
it
is
as
i
have
stated.
now,
the
trial
court
admitted
the
evidence
of
the
custom
but
as
i
have
pointed
out,
stated
that
nonetheless.
and
this
is
a
basic
error
in
my
opinion,
it
felt
that
federal
laws
and
regulations
should
control.
well,
there
is
no
federal
common
law
and
hence
no
federal
respondeat
theory.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
stiles
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
stiles
denied
any
such
knowledge,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
was
that
before
this
man
on
this
day
got
the
truck,
he
had
been
out
in
the
morning
or
rather
he
had
be
been
out
on
that
afternoon
drinking,
went
back
to
the
post
at
7
and
got
the
truck
at
8
but
there
was
no
showing
except
an
inference
that
you
might
draw
that
perhaps
they
should
have
been
more
careful.
but
in
any
event,
the
fact
of
the
authorization
founded
upon
custom
is
clear.
now,
here
the
girl
who
was
injured
was
herself
employed
at
an
installation
on
guam.
she
was
also
an
air
corps
employee
at
night.
on
this
particular
night,
she
had
taught
school.
she
--
there's
no
claim
of
contributory
negligence.
she
is
an
innocent
victim.
she
has
laceration.
she
has
a
fracture
of
various
vertebrae.
she
has
permanent
limitations
of
her
leg.
she
has
persistent
pains.
she
has
uncontrollable
trembling
of
her
muscles.
she
has
permanent
injuries.
she
has
a
loss
of
ability
to
work
to
an
extent
of
35%
with
medical
expenses
and
loss
of
earnings.
and
in
my
opinion,
congress
intended
that
under
these
facts
where
california
law
would
permit
a
recovery
that
there
should
be
a
recovery
in
this
case.
the
murphey
case
to
which
i
adverted
at
179
f.2nd
743,
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
court
again
was
authority
for
the
proposition
that
recreation,
and
this
is
an
important
aspect
in
connection
with
the
trip
ticket
being
made
out
for
official
business,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
murphey
case
held
that
recreation
was
itself
for
the
benefit
of
the
master
and
hence
would
be
official
business.
in
the
type
of
factual
situation
of
the
murphey
case
namely
a
small
isolated
post
in
northern
california.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
your
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
no,
your
honor.
it
--
it
appears
that
for
example
in
the
morning,
of
the
--
when
these
three
men
had
been
out,
they
hitchhiked.
so,
when
night
came
they
--
they
would
propose,
have
to
have
some
army
vehicles
to
get
to
any
place
of
recreation
and
the
nco
--
the
nco
club
is
at
a
distance
away
from
the
post.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
well,
it
was
the
custom
of
the
men,
your
honor,
to
avail
themselves
of
these
trucks.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
or
the
officers
to
take
jeeps.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
and
my
point
would
be
that
if
an
officer
or
a
man
while
using
the
army
vehicle
under
those
circumstances,
even
though
he
did
get
drunk,
hurts
somebody
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
applies.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
that
also
was
custom.
what
would
happen,
your
honor,
would
be
that
in
the
morning
the
trip
ticket
would
be
made
out
to
some
one
individual
and
the
evidence
showed
that
then
the
man
passed
this
around
and
that
if
it
was
made
out
to
meet
clausen
while
any
--
any
other
man
during
the
day
when
i
got
through
with
this
truck,
could
have
the
truck
if
they
got
this
particular
ticket.
the
ticket
being
made
out
to
me
and
my
errand
having
been
completed,
the
fact
would
be
that
it
would
perhaps
as
in
this
case
be
made
out
to
24
hours.
so,
when
i
brought
the
truck
back,
some
other
man
would
get
the
ticket
and
in
this
case
sergeant
stiles
gave
the
ticket
to
seabourn.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
it
--
it
--
it's
a
different
way,
your
honor.
he
went
out
of
the
post
under
the
umbrella
of
the
ticket
that
covered
this
vehicle
and
it
again,
your
honor,
was
custom
on
this
post
for
some
18
months
to
pass
this
around
as
the
witnesses
testified
among
the
men
in
the
service
dock
where
this
man,
seabourn,
was
assigned.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
well,
i
can
read
something
else
into
it
and
your
honor
brings
up
a
point.
i
can
read
an
army
regulation
to
a
--
in
a
left-handed
way
to
--
to
authorize
this
procedure
and
may
i
say
this,
your
honor.
when
your
--
when
your
honor
speaks
of
an
army
regulation
which
is
not
the
law
of
california
court
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
when
your
army
--
when
your
honor
speaks
of
an
army
regulation,
there
are
changes,
there
are
interpretive
decisions
by
the
judge
advocate
general.
there
are
or
any
number
of
--
of
facets
to
that
which
you
must
consider.
we
can't
isolate
and
just
look
at
one
army
regulation.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
your
honor,
it
would
be
quite
--
quite
the
contrary.
the
commanding
officer
here
in
this
particular
case
would
know
that
this
practice
was
going
on
for
18
months.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
why
the
man
testified
that
his
--
that
--
that
the
--
that
his
superior,
a
lieutenant
werb
and
other
men
would
use
the
jeeps
and
that
the
men
themselves
would
use
the
truck.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
your
honor.
stiles'
testimony
was
excluded
on
motion.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
seabourn.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
the
--
the
corporal.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
and
also
schmidt.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
and
also
schmidt.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
no,
your
honor.
except
that
it
was
deemed
by
the
court
immaterial.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
yes,
your
honors.
i'll
put
the
--
the
--
and
your
honor,
the
johnson
case
that
i
have
cited
explains
out
the
--
this
great
particularity
with
the
johnson
case
--
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
--
decision
at
181
f.577
and
that
cites
the
pertinent
derivation
and
the
pedigree
of
the
law
of
guam.
mr.
henry
c.
clausen
some
of
the
questions
asked
by
your
honors
have
been
asked
of
the
witnesses
and
are
in
the
record
on
this
factual
aspect
and
i
would
like
to
advert
to
them.
for
example,
the
passenger
smith
was
asked
at
page
134
of
the
record
this
question,
is
it
correct
that
--
rather,
it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
the
trip
tickets
including
the
said
trip
ticket
mentioned
in
service
stock
was
always
passed
around
between
the
men
working
in
that
section
regardless
of
the
name
of
the
individual
to
whom
the
trip
ticket
was
made
out?
answer
-
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct,
although,
i
don't
know
if
this
vessel
--
this
vehicle,
had
a
trip
ticket.
then
state
whether
that
was
the
usual
procedure.
now
what
i'm
stating
to
your
honor
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record.
this
is
the
controlling
evidence.
so
regardless
of
any
finding
that
any
court
may
have
made
on
my
attack
on
the
finding,
it
would
be
unsubstantiated
if
this
is
the
evidence
of
what
i'm
saying
is
true.
question
-
state
whether
that
was
the
usual
procedure,
in
other
words,
to
pass
these
trip
tickets
around,
whether
the
use
of
the
vehicle
was
official
business
or
recreation
of
the
individual
using
it.
answer
-
yes,
sir.
that
was
the
usual
procedure.
when
it
was
for
recreation,
it
was
used
for
that
purpose
and
when
it
was
for
official
business,
it
was
used
for
that
purpose.
state
whether
the
trip
ticket
in
question
was
issued
therefore
for
official
business
was
by
this
usual
procedure
also,
for
your
use
of
the
vehicle
for
recreation?
answer
-
if
there
was
a
trip
ticket,
the
vehicle
could
have
been
used
for
official
business
or
for
recreation.
now
then,
at
page
139
of
the
witness
here,
is
the
passenger
in
the
car,
that's
schmidt,
138.
for
how
long
a
period
to
your
knowledge
was
the
procedure
noted
above
with
respect
to
the
mode
and
method
of
trip
tickets
covering
any
motor
vehicle
in
effect
on
the
island
of
guam?
answer
-
as
long
as
i
was
over
there,
and
i
was
over
there
for
about
15
months
as
of
about
march
3,
1949.
give
the
names,
rank,
grade
and
stations
of
the
various
people
in
the
united
states
armed
forces
who
to
your
knowledge,
authorized
or
followed
the
noted
mode
and
method
of
trip
tickets
and
procedure
prior
to
the
date
of
the
collision?
answer
-
every
one
in
my
outfit
use
this
procedure.
i
--
i
remember
the
names
of
private
first-class
slinker,
sergeant
rafael
herrera,
and
lieutenant
john
reese.
i
can't
remember
any
other
names.
i
don't
know
their
present
locations,
rank
or
station.
when
seabourn
set
forth
in
his
statement
the
trip
ticket
was
good
for
this
vehicle
until
9:30
a.m.,
friday,
march
the
4th.
state
the
mode
and
method
of
obtaining
such
a
trip
ticket
and
by
whom
it
was
issued.
answer
-
i
don't
know
who
issued
the
trip
ticket
which
seabourn
had
if
he
had
one.
but
the
method
of
obtaining
trip
tickets
was
to
take
the
vehicle
kept
in
the
squadron
area
down
to
the
dispatch
office,
obtain
a
trip
ticket
from
the
dispatcher
who
was
on
duty
and
there
was
a
dispatcher
on
duty
24
hours
a
day.
question
-
when
seabourn
states
in
his
statement,
the
trip
tickets
and
service
truck
were
always
passed
around
between
the
men
working
in
that
section
regardless
of
the
name
of
the
individual
the
trip
ticket
was
made
out
to.
state
how
long
such
a
procedure
had
been
followed
to
your
knowledge
in
your
section.
answer
-
the
procedure
was
followed
in
the
section
i
was
in
as
long
as
i
was
assigned
to
the
section.
i
was
in
the
section
about
a
year.
question
-
when
seabourn
set
forth
in
his
statement,
that
was
the
usual
procedure
whether
the
--
whether
the
use
of
the
vehicle
was
official
business
or
recreation
of
the
individual
using
it.
state
how
long
that
procedure
had
been
followed
to
your
knowledge
in
your
section
before
the
collision?
answer
-
that
procedure
was
also
followed
during
the
time
i
was
in
the
section
and
i
had
been
in
the
section
about
a
year
before
march
03,
1949.
question
-
state
the
individuals
in
your
section
who
followed
that
procedure
including
officers
and
enlisted
men.
answer
-
all
the
men
in
the
section
used
the
truck
and
some
of
the
men
that
i
remember
who
were
in
my
section
were
private
first-class
slinker,
sergeant
herrera,
lieutenant
john
reese,
the
same
as
i
mentioned
before.
and
your
honor,
without
laboring
them
out
of
here,
the
same
testimony
was
given
by
seabourn
on
pages
126,
127,
130
and
131.
i
did
wish
to
advert
to
counsel's
statement
that
i
was
basing
my
case
on
this
permissive
use
statute
of
california,
i
am
not.
california
follows
the
respondeat
theory
doctrine.
the
permissive
use
statute
is
merely
a
statute
which
says
that
if
you
permit
someone
to
take
your
vehicle,
you
--
you
are
responsible
up
to
a
given
sum
of
$5000.
but
the
murphey
case
points
out
that
california
follows
the
traditional
common
law,
respondeat
theory
superior
doctrine
and
which
can't
be
found
in
federal
law
since
there
is
no
federal
common
law.
now
that's
pointed
out
here
in
the
murphey
case
and
in
the
murphey
case
the
man
was
authorized,
your
honors,
to
take
the
vehicle,
drive
to
the
town
of
klamath
in
northern
california
and
instructed
to
park
the
car
right
at
the
place
of
amusement,
namely,
the
movie
house.
he
deviated.
he
didn't
do
that.
he
took
the
car,
brought
some
men
down
and
then
departed
and
deviated.
he
went
then
to
--
of
course,
to
pick
up
some
women.
and
then
he
had
something
to
drink.
and
then
when
he
--
he
was
going
away
in
some
prohibited
mission
to,
namely,
to
an
indian
ceremonial
and
while
enroute
on
this
deviated,
departure
mission,
he
caused
a
death
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
179
f.2nd,
743
reversed
the
trial
court
and
held
that
under
the
law
of
california,
applicable
under
the
federal
torts
claim
act,
that
the
government
in
this
case
intended
and
the
congress
intended
to
assume
that
risk
can
bear
that
burden.
