mr.
morton
h.
hollander
may
it
please
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
the
court.
since
i
have
only
a
very
few
minutes
before
the
recess,
i
would
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
shed
some
additional
light
on
some
of
the
factual
questions
that
were
asked
of
my
friend
on
the
other
side.
the
basic
contention
in
this
case
has
been
that
there
was
this
custom
so-called
loose
practice
of
allowing
trucks
to
be
taken
out
for
joyriding
purposes
by
soldiers.
but
this
case
of
course
was
tried
before
a
district
court
and
we
have
district
court
findings.
it
went
up
on
appeal
for
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
also
have
findings
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
district
court,
petitioner
proposed
a
finding
to
the
effect
that
there
was
such
a
custom
and
that
seabourn's
use
of
this
vehicle
was
authorized
because
it
was
in
accord
with
this
custom,
that
was
an
explicit
finding
proposed
by
petitioner,
proposed
by
the
plaintiff.
the
district
judge
after
appraising
all
of
the
evidence
that
has
been
introduced
expressly
rejected
that
proposed
finding,
holding
expressly
in
findings
of
facts
that
seabourn's
use
of
the
vehicle
was
not
authorized.
on
appeal,
petitioner
pressed
as
one
of
his
essential
specifications
of
error,
that
same
contention
that
the
district
court
erred
in
failing
to
find
that
seabourn's
use
of
the
vehicle
was
in
accord
with
the
so-called
custom
which
apparently
has
prevailed
according
to
petitioner
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
the
court
of
appeals
too,
in
passing
on
this
alleged
error
finding
that
seabourn's
use
of
the
vehicle
was
unauthorized
and
that
his
practice
to
answer
judge
--
mr.
justice
clark's
question
that
this
practice,
the
record
shows
at
page
180,
this
practice
was
without
--
without
the
knowledge
or
approval
of
their
superior
officers.
there
was
an
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
identical
finding
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
there
was
an
identical
finding
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
seabourn's
use
of
the
vehicle
was
unauthorized
by
the
army
regulations,
was
unauthorized
by
his
superior
officers
and
was
unauthorized
by
this
so-called
trip
ticket
which
he
had
obtained
prior
to
taking
the
vehicle
off
the
post.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
he
found
specifically
that
seabourn's
use
--
he
--
he
explicitly
rejected
the
proposed
finding.
there
was
a
proposed
finding
to
the
effect
that
seabourn
had
taken
the
vehicle
out
in
accordance
with
this
so-called
customs
and
he
refused
to
so
find.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
no.
he's
made
no
such
statement.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
into
--
on
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
spend
two
or
three
minutes
to
shed
some
additional
light
on
two
other
questions
that
were
asked
from
the
bench
during
the
course
of
petitioner's
argument.
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
there
was
any
other
means
of
transportation
available
to
soldiers
like
seabourn
or
whether
they
had
to
rely
almost
exclusively
on
transportation
afforded
by
the
army.
the
record
--
there
are
two
places
in
the
record
at
pages
16
and
at
pages
22,
it
definitely
establishes
--
definitely
establishes
that
there
was
other
transportations
available,
that
there
was
taxi
cab
transportation
available.
that
there
were
--
that
--
and
that
indeed
on
the
day
in
question,
seabourn,
the
driver
who
later
took
out
the
army
vehicle
at
night
and
his
two
companions
had
utilized
the
services
of
the
cab
and
they
already
had
that
very
afternoon.
the
--
the
other
factual
question
that
was
asked
was
by
mr.
justice
harlan
who
wanted
to
know
whether
there
was
any
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
stiles
knew
that
seabourn
was
drunk
at
the
time
that
he
took
the
vehicle
off
the
post
or
has
been
drinking.
i
--
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
some
slight
evidence
with
what
--
there
was
considerable
evidence
on
that
sort
in
sergeant
stiles'
affidavit,
which
as
my
adversary
has
correctly
pointed
out.
it
was
stricken
from
the
record
on
his
motion
at
the
trial
court.
for
that
reason,
i
will
not
discuss
its
content.
however,
there
was
other
information
that
was
--
there
was
other
evidence
that
was
properly
admitted
at
page
17
of
the
record
which
indicates
that
during
the
daytime,
seabourn
was
not
drunk.
that
information
is
set
forth
in
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
page
17
of
the
record.
however
i
should
like
to
point
this
out,
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
was
negligent
or
as
to
whether
or
not
sergeant
stiles
was
negligent
in
entrusting
a
vehicle
to
seabourn
is
at
all
before
this
court
at
this
time.
this
case
and
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
not
predicated
on
the
allegation
that
the
government
was
negligent
because
sergeant
stiles
negligently
entrusted
a
vehicle
to
corporal
seabourn.
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
is
limited
exclusively
--
exclusively
limited
to
the
asserted
negligence
on
the
part
of
seabourn
in
operating
the
vehicle
after
he
had
obtained
it.
and
obviously,
since
that
is
the
only
issue
of
negligence
which
was
raised
by
the
complaint,
it
was
the
only
issue
of
negligence
with
respect
to
which
the
government
put
on
any
defense.
it
was
the
only
issue
of
negligence
of
course
which
was
with
respect
to
which
the
government
found
it
necessary
to
cross-examine
it.
it
was
the
only
issue
tried
by
the
court,
that
is
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
seabourn
himself
was
negligent.
and
of
course,
it
was
the
only
issue
with
respect
to
which
the
trial
judge
made
any
specific
findings.
that
was
never
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
wasn't
even
mentioned
or
suggested
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
and
we
think
for
those
reasons
that
petitioner
actually
stopped
from
asserting
at
this
time
as
he
does
in
the
last
part
of
his
brief
that
this
case
presents
the
additional
question
or
suggests
that
this
other
avenue
of
governmental
liability
that
is
--
that
perhaps
the
government
was
liable
in
entrusting
the
vehicle
and
to
--
perhaps
the
government
through
sergeant
stiles
was
negligent
to
entrust
and
liable
in
entrusting
the
vehicle
to
corporal
seabourn.
that
has
never
been
in
the
case.
the
first
time
it
came
into
the
case,
the
first
time
it
succeeds
upon
was
in
the
petition
as
we
come
in
here.
we
believe
this
case
actually
boils
down
to
this
simple
proposition
reflected
by
this
very
brief
summary
which
i
am
about
to
give
of
the
operative
facts
involved.
seabourn,
a
soldier
stationed
at
guam,
was
given
a
pass
so
that
he
could
be
relieved
completely
from
his
military
duties
for
a
day
or
so.
he
took
advantage
of
that
pass
and
went
to
the
town
during
the
daytime
and
as
i
have
pointed
out,
hired
a
cab
with
two
of
his
companions
during
the
daytime
spending
his
day
--
spending
his
day
in
town
completely
removed
from
any
connection
with
any
official
governmental
--
with
any
official
governmental
duty,
completely
disassociated
from
the
performance
of
the
routine
military
mission
normally
assigned
to
him
in
which
he
was
discharging
when
he
was
not
out
there.
he
spent
the
whole
day
on
passing
town,
came
back
at
night
and
then
obtained
possession
of
this
vehicle
which
both
courts
found,
he
had
obtained
in
an
unauthorized
fashion
for
a
use
not
permitted
by
the
army
regulations,
for
a
use
not
permitted
by
his
superior
officers
and
for
a
use
not
permitted
by
the
trip
ticket
which
he
used
in
order
to
remove
the
vehicle
from
the
post.
having
obtained
that
vehicle,
he
went
out
with
his
two
companions
on
a
drinking
spree.
he
was,
as
the
evidence
shows
that
he
--
that
he
was
--
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
the
courts
pointed
out,
that
he
was
very
seriously
intoxicated
at
the
time.
while
on
that
intoxicated
state,
he
went
joyriding
with
this
vehicle
and
crashed
into
the
car
in
which
petitioner
was
sitting.
now
we
believe
that
under
that
basic
factual
setup.
no
court
--
no
court
in
the
land
has
and
we
do
no
think
that
any
court
in
the
land
should
hold
that
the
employer
of
--
the
employer
of
the
person
who,
on
a
day-off,
takes
unauthorized
possession
of
an
employer's
vehicle,
uses
it
for
a
purpose
prohibit
--
uses
it
for
a
purpose
prohibited
by
his
employer,
uses
it
for
a
purpose
in
no
way
connected
--
in
no
way
connected
with
the
discharge
of
the
duties
assigned
to
that
employee
in
the
scope
of
his
employment.we
believe
that
under
that
factual
setup,
no
court
in
the
land
has
and
no
court
in
the
land
should
uphold
the
employer
liable
under
a
theory
of
respondeat
superior.
the
touchstone
of
which
and
the
chief
criterion
which
must
be
met
is
performance
of
some
business
on
behalf
of
the
employer.
that
of
course
is
the
--
the
essential,
the
logical,
the
only
rational
justification
for
imposing
vicarious
liabilities
on
an
employer
not
for
his
tort
but
for
some
tort
committed
by
his
employee.
that
justification
is
that
the
employee
at
the
time
was
performing
some
work
of
interest
to
the
employer
was
in
some
way
performing
some
duty
the
employer
had
assigned
to
him
and
for
that
reason,
the
courts
have
always
imposed
this
respondeat
superior
liability
which
compels
the
master
to
answer
for
the
tort
of
the
service
committed
by
the
servant
while
the
servant
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
and
while
the
servant
while
then
acting
was
actively
discharging
some
business
of
the
employer.
now
that
same
traditional
--
that
fundamental
concept
of
respondeat
superior
was
not
--
was
not
ignored
by
congress
when
they've
taken
the
--
the
tort
claims
act
to
the
contrary.
congress
used
very
precise
language
to
make
absolute
and
certain
that
that
in
our
concept
of
respondeat
superior
would
be
transplanted
into
the
tort
claims
act,
so
that
the
united
states,
under
the
tort
claims
act
can
be
held
liable
only
--
only
where
its
employee
has
committed
a
tort
while
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
i
--
i
should
not
think,
your
honor,
that
that
would
affect
a
governmental
immunity
from
liability.
i
think
that
in
that
situation,
if
the
employee
even
though
specifically
authorized
to
use
the
vehicle
was
using
it
on
a
personal
purpose,
was
using
it
for
his
own
convenience,
for
his
own
pleasure,
was
using
it
for
a
reason
which
in
no
way
furthered
the
official
military
duties
to
which
he
has
been
assigned,
i
think
that
in
that
situation
there
--
there
still
would
not
be
liability
under
the
respondeat
superior
theory
of
liability
which
is
predicated
--
which
is
predicated.
every
court
passing
on
the
problem
has
held
on
the
employee's
performance
of
a
function
of
interest
to
his
employer.
the
employee
must
at
the
time
be
furthering
his
employer's
interest.
there
may
be
other
addends
of
liability
under
which
a
private
employer
may,
in
a
situation
which
the
chief
justice
puts,
be
held
liable.
there
is
in
california
for
example
a
permissive
use
statute.
under
that
statute
--
under
that
statute,
it
is
possible
for
an
employer
who
authorizes
an
employee
to
use
the
employer's
vehicle
to
be
held
liable
for
the
negligent
operation
of
that
vehicle
even
though
the
vehicle
was
not
being
operated
within
the
scope
of
the
--
of
the
employee's
employment.
indeed
it
is
possible
under
the
permissive
use
statute
in
california
and
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
about
nine
other
states
for
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
after
having
authorized
its
use
by
some
other
person
to
be
liable
for
its
negligent
operation
even
though
the
person
whose
use
is
authorized
had
no
employment
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
owner.
it
can
be
a
friend
or
any
--
anybody
to
whom
their
vehicle
was
entrusted.
under
the
permissive
use
statute
theory
of
liability,
it
is
possible
beyond
the
respondeat
superior
scope
of
employment
field
to
fasten
liability
on
the
owner
of
such
a
vehicle.
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
that
california
recognizes
the
sharp
distinction
between
that
type
of
liability
which
perhaps,
your
honor,
has
in
mind
and
the
normal
respondeat
superior
liability
where
the
employer
may
be
held
liable
only
where
the
employee
is
furthering
employer's
business
or
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
california
in
fact
limits
the
liability
of
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
under
the
permissive
use
statute
theory
of
liability
to
$5000
for
personal
injuries.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
$5000,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
does
it
apply
to
the
employee?
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
oh
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
possible
in
california
for
an
employee
who
is
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
but
who
is
authorized
to
drive
his
employer's
vehicle
to
expose
the
--
his
employer-owner
of
the
vehicle
to
liability
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
for
his
negligence
not
to
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well,
no
matter
what
he
does
with
the
vehicle,
the
employer
can
authorize
him
to
take
the
vehicle
out
for
purely
personal
use.
he
can
authorize
him
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
in
fact
to
go
out
and
get
drunk
with
the
vehicle.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well
then,
we
are
confronted
by
the
traditional,
the
--
the
problem
which
has
plagued
the
courts
in
the
traditional
distinction
between
a
frolic
or
detour.
we
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
deviation
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well,
that's
under
this
permissive
use
statute.
there
--
may
be
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
my
opponent
was
referring
to,
your
honor,
but
i
think
when
he
was
making
that
argument,
he
was
referring
to
the
type
of
liability
which
is
imposed
upon
the
owner
of
a
vehicle
not
because
of
any
employment
relationship
between
the
owner
and
the
driver,
not
because
the
driver
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
but
which
is
imposed
on
the
owner
only
as
an
incident
of
ownership
of
the
vehicle
and
having
authorized
its
use
he's
held
liable.
i
should
like
to
point
this
out
to
your
honors
that
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well
at
that
type
of
liability,
your
honor,
this
permissive
use
type
of
liability
is
not
recognized
by
the
tort
claims
act.
that
is
the
type
of
liability
which
the
express
wording
of
the
tort
claims
act
precludes
because
the
tort
claims
act
is
in
terms
limited
to
the
act
of
an
employee
of
the
government
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
that's
the
fundamental
precondition
of
liability
that
runs
throughout
the
entire
act.
once
you
show
that
the
employee
has
acted
outside
the
scope
of
his
employment
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
as
we
think
we
definitely
established
in
both
courts
below,
then,
it
is
impossible
to
rely
in
any
other
theory
of
liability
even
though
it
might
be
available
to
a
private
plaintiff
under
state
law.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
i've
got
no
one
as
being
off
limits,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
there
were.
a
number
of
them
were
in
the
town
of
agana
insofar
as
i
know,
the
term
is
not
off
limits.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well,
i
think
that
illustrates
the
extent
to
which
my
opponent
is
willing
to
abandon
the
conventional
respondeat
superior
test
and
substitute
in
its
stead
simply
because
this
particular
driver
was
a
soldier,
to
substitute
in
its
stead
because
this
particular
driver
was
a
soldier,
a
totally
unprecedented
type
of
liability.
of
course
every
employer
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
because
no
employer
has
ever
been
held
liable
in
this
country
under
the
theory
of
respondeat
superior
in
circumstances
of
this
sort
where
an
employee
takes
the
employer's
car
out
on
a
personal
mission,
uses
it
for
drinking
and
joyriding
and
has
an
accident.
no
court
has
ever
held
any
employer
liable
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
every
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
oh,
that
is
not
this
case,
your
honor.
i
have
no
doubt,
your
honor,
that
if
the
fort
belvoir
--
the
commanding
officer
dispatched
a
group
of
soldiers
in
the
evening
with
an
authorized
truck
driver,
an
authorize
truck
and
sent
them
into
a
camp
to
attend
the
u.s.o.
dance,
i
have
absolutely
no
--
that
--
that
if
there
was
negligent
operation
of
that
truck
that
the
government
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
if
--
if
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
if
the
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
if
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
i
think
your
honor,
that's
an
entirely
different
situation.
if
the
trip
is
one
actually
authorized
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
the
army
regulations
allow
use
of
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well
the
army
regulations,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
critical
because
the
army
regulations
do
allow
the
use
of
army
vehicles,
they
do
allow
expressly
use
of
army
vehicles
within
the
discretion
of
the
commanding
officer
where
the
army
vehicle
is
going
to
be
put
to
some
recreational
use
which
has
been
approved
by
the
army,
organized
by
the
army,
and
is
supervised
by
the
army,
and
controlled
by
the
army.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well,
i
--
i
think
they
dovetail,
your
honor,
i
think
they
dovetail
because
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
and
let
us
suppose
the
situation,
your
honor,
where
he
was
authorized
to
go
out
and
get
drunk
and
go
to
anywhere.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
mere
authorization,
standing
by
itself,
will
not
enable
a
quick
or
an
easy
answer
to
that
problem.
there
--
there
are
many
other
circumstances
which
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well
basically,
we
take
the
position
that
the
question
of
scope
of
employment
the
--
the
general
question
of
the
employment
of
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
its
employees,
federal
or
civilian
as
this
court
held
in
the
gillman
case,
as
this
court
held
in
the
feres
case,
as
this
court
held
in
standard
oil
in
332
u.s.
we
take
the
basic
position
that
a
federal
law
is
the
common
denominator
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
man
who
was
actually
an
employee
of
the
government
and
also
whether
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
i
want
to
point
this
out
though
to
your
honor
that
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
look
to
federal
law
or
whether
you
look
to
state
law.
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
stated
plainly
in
their
opinion
that
even
reference
to
state
law
would
be
of
no
comfort
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
hold
further
that
no
private
employer
under
the
law
of
any
state
would
be
held
liable
in
a
factual
situation
of
this
sort,
where
an
employee
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
petitioner
has
been
unable
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
oh
yes,
your
honor,
there's
absolutely
no
doubt
about
that.
the
only
difficulty,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
not
a
deviation
case.
he
wasn't
on
an
official
mission
from
which
he
had
deviated
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
i
--
i
can
conceive
of
situations
where
the
army
takes
such
a
vital
interest
in
a
particular
recreational
activity
that
the
discharge
of
that
recreational
activity
is
of
such
vital
and
acute
interest
to
the
military
establishment
that
its
discharge
might
conceivably
be
viewed
as
having
been
primarily
in
the
government's
interest
rather
than
the
individual
employees,
and
for
that
reason,
the
employees
engaged
in
that
activity
would
be
considered
as
having
been
within
the
scope
of
their
employment
at
the
time.
i
can
see
where
an
army
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
so.
i
think
that
the
question
of
fact
in
this
case
has
been
resolved.
and
i
think
it
was
resolved.
i
think
it
was
correctly
resolved.
it
was
resolved
by
the
district
court.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
resolved
again
by
the
court
of
appeals.
both
courts
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
our
short
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
matter
is
controlled
by
federal
law.
but
i
think
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
makes
absolute
--
absolutely
no
difference
because
whether
you
resort
to
federal
law
or
whether
you
resort
to
state
law,
a
petitioner
can
find
no
comfort
because
he
has
not
cited
and
we
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
in
any
jurisdiction
which
would
impose
liability
upon
a
private
employer
for
a
tort
of
this
sort
under
the
theory
of
respondeat
superior.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
yes,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
to
be
whether
on
the
merits
on
the
questions
of
negligence,
contributory
negligence,
proximate
causation,
damages
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
the
state
law
apply
absolutely.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
the
government
exclusively
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
who
is
an
employee
after
--
after
all
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
the
--
the
government
cannot
find
that
because
it
operates
within
the
48
states
in
the
territories
that
the
same
person,
as
soon
as
he
leaves
state
a
and
goes
across
to
state
b
is
an
employee
for
the
purposes
of
state
a
but
is
not
an
employee
for
state
b.
we
think
all
of
the
basic
considerations
are
set
forth
in
this
court's
three
opinions
in
the
feres
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
and
standard
oil.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
yes,
your
honor,
its
certainly
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
the
basis
is
still
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well,
the
basis
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
the
basis
for
liability
will
vary
as
far
as
the
merits
of
the
case
are
concerned,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
because
i
--
in
--
in
view
of
those
three
decisions
which
we
rely
on,
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
impute
to
congress
an
intent
in
writing
the
tort
claims
act
to
supplant
the
uniform
relationship
between
the
government
and
its
employees
by
the
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
unfair
to
--
to
impute
to
congress
a
--
a
contrary
result,
one
which
would
result
in
the
irrational
plan
of
subjecting
the
government
to
different
types
of
employment
relationships
in
the
48
states.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well
that
if
--
the
--
the
question
of
course
is
before
this
court
for
the
first
time,
three
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
--
have
passed
on
it
and
we
cite
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
oh
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
from
the
same
--
no
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
the
--
the
generally
established
principles
that
have
guided
the
federal
courts
traditionally
in
evaluating
the
scope
of
employment
question,
the
respondeat
superior
relationship,
you
would
get
it
from
the
cases
from
the
federal
cases
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
--
and
before
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
before
erie
and
tompkins,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
erie
and
tompkins,
of
course,
rejected
it
in
a
nongovernmental
sphere,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
there
--
there
were
immediate
exceptions
to
erie
against
tompkins
--
to
erie
against
tompkins
drawn
within
a
short
period
of
time
thereafter
with
respect
to
the
government
relationship
and
this
court
has
always
viewed
the
relationship
between
the
employee
and
--
and
the
government.
the
government
employment
relationship
has
always
been
viewed
as
exclusively
one
for
a
federal
law.
we
think
and
in
any
event,
your
honor,
that
in
this
case
it
essentially
did
--
no
difference
at
all
because
here
it's
clear
that
the
california
law
or
guamanian
law,
the
law
of
any
other
jurisdiction
will
coincide
perfectly
with
the
federal
law
on
the
question
and
that
you
reach
the
same
result
no
matter
what
law
you
look
to.
now
--
mr.
morton
h.
hollander
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
--
it
boils
down
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
his
activity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
tort
he
committed
was
activity
of
furtherance
to
his
employer's
interest
and
therefore
met
the
--
the
chief
criteria
for
determination
of
respondeat
superior
liability.
