here
the
officer?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
--
is
every
--
every
soldier
on
guam
all
the
time
declared
acting
in
the
line
of
duty
wherever
he
may
go?
unknown
speaker
but
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
whether
his
action
is
in
the
line
of
duty,
is
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
in
this
instance,
if
he
was
--
he
always?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
whatever
he
does
is
in
the
line
of
his
duty?
unknown
speaker
but
whatever
action
happens,
whatever
accident
happened,
on
the
time
that
he
violates
on
guam
is
an
act
that
happens
in
the
line
of
duty?
unknown
speaker
had
a
pass
to
use
the
truck,
was
that
in
the
act?
unknown
speaker
that
was
--
that
was
for
official
--
for
official
use,
then
you
come
to
the
question
of
custom
on
that?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
is
it
show
as
custom,
was
it
testimony
of
someone?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
denial
of
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
clausen,
i
--
i
can't
understand
why
he
has
to
(inaudible)
sneaking
or
whatever
you
call
it,
and
gets
the
truck
in
someone
else's
name,
just
try
it
with
that.
unknown
speaker
he
went
out
of
the
post
in
another
man's
ticket
then?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
an
order
of
the
commanding
officer
that
they'd
only
be
for
official
business
on
the
post?
unknown
speaker
the
custom
to
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
--
this
stiles
is
a
sergeant?
unknown
speaker
is
that
stiles'
testimony?
unknown
speaker
then
who
testified
that
that
was
the
custom?
unknown
speaker
that's
--
unknown
speaker
he
is
the
one
that
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
he
is
the
one
who
had
the
truck
out?
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
any
testimony
by
a
commanding
officer
or
any
officers
at
the
post
that
that
was
the
custom
if
they
knew
about
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
you
--
the
evidence
--
what
you
said
that
it
was
a
statute
that
gives
--
carries
the
--
the
law
of
california
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
what
--
under
that
permissive
--
unknown
speaker
does
the
permissive
use
statute
--
up
in
california
apply
to
an
employee?
unknown
speaker
to
an
employee.
unknown
speaker
if
he
--
unknown
speaker
whether
he
deviates
from
his
instructions?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
he
authorized
--
unknown
speaker
he
authorized
him
to
take
it
out
for
business
use
and
the
employee
use
it
for
his
own
--
of
his
recreation.
unknown
speaker
well
i
--
i
understood
your
--
followed
to
say
that
in
california
a
detour
or
deviation
can
be
a
purpose
for
which
this
vehicle
was
given
to
an
employee
or
another
person,
a
stranger,
applied
and
that
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
would
be
liable
under
that
because
he
had
permitted
to
use
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well
then
how
--
how
do
you
distinguish
the
--
unknown
speaker
don't
you
mean
--
perhaps
i
don't
seem
to
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
it's
controlled
by
federal
laws
of
law
--
so
far
as
the
liability
and
the
exception
that
you
say,
but
is
it
not
controlled
by
state
law
so
far
as
liability
of
admitted
--
of
persons
admittedly
covered
by
the
act?
unknown
speaker
that
--
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
federal
law
applies
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
determining
who
--
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
does
this
case
boil
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
soldier
was
engaged
in
the
recreational
activity
at
the
time
of
this
act?
if
it
was
recreational,
then
it
was
authorized.
and
if
it
was
authorized,
he's
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment.
if
it
wasn't,
it
wasn't.
