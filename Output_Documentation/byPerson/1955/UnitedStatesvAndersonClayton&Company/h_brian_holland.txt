mr.
h.
brian
holland
if
the
court
please.
this
--
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims
like
the
glenshaw
glass
and
the
goldman
theatres
cases
decided
at
the
last
term.
this
case
involves
the
scope
or
a
particular
application
of
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
concept
of
taxable
income
under
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
in
those
cases,
the
question
was
whether
punitive
damages
were
taxable
income.
in
the
instant
case,
the
question
is
whether
the
respondent
corporation
having
purchased
certain
shares
of
its
own
stock
realized
taxable
income
when
a
few
years
later,
it
resold
some
of
those
shares
at
a
prize
in
excess
of
the
prize
that
they've
had
paid
for
them.
the
facts
are
these.
the
respondent
corporation
was
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
delaware
in
the
year
1929.
had
his
principal
place
of
business
in
houston,
texas.
it
was
engaged
in
the
cotton
merchandising
business
which
according
to
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
court
below
is
primarily
a
management
business,
dependent
for
it's
success
upon
the
skill
and
experience
of
it's
principal
executives
who
are
called
upon
to
make
difficult
day-to-day
decisions
as
to
purchases
and
sales
of
spot
cotton
and
dealings
in
cotton
futures
both
domestic
and
foreign.
the
corporation
was
capitalized
at
the
outset
with
$26,000,000
of
preferred
stock
representing
the
value
of
the
assets
of
a
prior
business
which
it
took
over
in
1929
and
100,000
shares
of
common
stock
which
was
issued
to
and
held
exclusively
by
its
executives.
the
common
stock
was
no
per
stock
with
a
stated
value
of
$1
a
share
and
was
designed
according
to
the
findings
below
to
provide
a
vehicle
for
the
distribution
of
future
earnings
among
those
who
were
responsible
for
the
success
of
the
corporation
business.
it
was
understood
from
the
outset
that
the
common
stock
should
be
held
exclusively
by
the
management
that
no
outsider
should
be
permitted
to
own
any
and
that
the
holdings
of
common
stock
should
be
adjusted
from
time
to
time
in
accordance
with
the
varying
capacity
and
responsibilities
of
the
several
members
of
the
management
group.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
h.
brian
holland
no.
that
was
a
--
that
was
at
first
a
general
understanding
and
then
in
1931,
that
understanding
was
incorporated
in
a
written
agreement
to
which
the
corporation
and
the
then
common
stockholders
were
parties.
at
the
time
their
agreement
was
executed,
the
holders
of
the
common
stock
deposited
their
stock
with
a
trustee,
retaining
the
right
to
the
dividends
and
the
right
to
vote
and
executed
this
formal
agreement
which
contained
a
number
of
previsions,
all
of
which
were
designed
to
keep
the
stock
closely
held.
for
example,
the
agreement
provided
that
no
common
stock
should
be
sold
that
is
by
any
of
the
holders
without
the
approval
of
holders
of
75%
of
the
common
stock.
the
agreement
provided
that
on
the
death
of
any
common
stockholder,
the
corporation
should
purchase
his
shares.
it
provided
that
a
common
stockholder
could
withdraw
at
anytime,
withdraw
from
the
stock
holding
group
involving
his
resignation
as
an
officer
of
the
corporation
and
that
the
corporation
would
purchase
his
shares
from
him.
it
also
provided
that
the
holders
of
75%
of
the
common
stock
could
at
anytime
require
a
holder
of
that
stock
to
sell
any
product
of
his
holdings.
there
were
provisions
in
this
agreement
for
the
fixing
of
the
price
at
which
purchases
and
sales
where
to
be
made.
in
the
case
of
the
death
of
a
stockholder,
the
price
was
based
--
the
price
to
be
paid
his
estate
by
the
corporation
under
the
agreement,
was
to
be
based
on
the
balance
sheet
of
the
corporation
as
of
the
end
of
the
preceding
fiscal
year
adjusted
to
reflect
unrealized
appreciation
and
depreciation
in
it's
assets,
all
as
determined
by
the
executive
committee
of
the
corporation.
and
after
that
basic
prize
had
been
determined
based
on
the
balance
sheet
then
there
was
to
be
added
interest
of
4%
from
evaluation
date
to
the
date
of
the
stockholders
death.
similarly,
there
were
provisions
made
with
which
were
not
immediately
concern
now
for
the
termination
of
the
price
in
the
case
of
purchases
and
sales
arising
on
the
other
circumstances
then
for
the
death
of
the
stockholder.
the
agreement
also
provided
expressly,
that
any
stock
purchased
by
the
corporation
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement
might
be
resold
at
anytime
on
--
on
such
terms
as
should
be
determined
by
the
holders
of
not
less
than
75%
of
the
common
stock.
now,
in
1939,
one
of
the
principal
stockholders
of
the
corporation
died
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
the
corporation
purchased
his
shares
which
at
that
time
numbered
18,574.
paying
for
those
shares,
a
price
determined
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
contract
of
$50.79
per
share.
those
shares
were
not
retired.
in
fact,
shortly
after
they
have
been
purchased
some
of
them
were
resold
--
some
of
them
were
resold
during
the
year
1939,
some
more,
i
think,
during
the
year
1940,
in
both
instances
at
prices
lower
than
the
prices
paid
by
the
corporation
to
the
estate
of
a
deceased
stockholder.
we're
not
now
concerned
with
those
sales
but
we
are
concerned
with
sales
which
occurred
in
the
year
1943,
december
18th,
1943
of
6500
of
these
shares
which
had
been
acquired
by
the
corporation
in
1939.
these
sales
in
1943
being
made
to
five
of
the
executives,
i
think,
junior
executives
of
the
corporation
at
the
price
determined
in
accordance
with
the
contract
formula
which
i
have
mentioned
which
as
of
that
time
was
$112.68
a
share
or
$51.89
more
than
the
corporation
had
paid
for
those
shares
in
1939.
now,
on
the
books
of
the
corporation,
when
the
shares
were
purchased
from
the
decedents
estate
that
cost
$50.79
a
share
was
charged
to
a
treasury
stock
account
and
for
balance
sheet
purposes,
the
common
stock
capital
was
reduce
by
the
stated
value
of
$1
per
share
and
the
remainder
of
the
cost
of
$49.79
per
share
was
charged
to
surplus.
when
the
6500
shares
were
resold
in
1943,
the
treasury
stock
account
was
credited
with
the
original
cost
of
those
shares
and
the
excess
of
the
selling
price
over
the
cost
was
credited
to
surplus.
at
that
time
the
corporation
apparently,
although
the
record
isn't
too
clear
on
this,
had
setup
a
separate
capital
surplus
account
and
it
appears
that
the
excess
of
the
proceeds
over
the
cost
was
credited
to
that
capital
surplus
account.
and
that
result
of
these
transactions,
the
purchase
of
1939
and
the
sale
in
1943
of
these
6500
shares
was
that
the
corporation
ended
up
with
an
increase
of
approximately
$400,000
in
its
net
worth.
that
or
rather
the
tax
on
that
amount
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
litigation.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
it
went
to
capital
surplus.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
well,
there
is
an
indication
in
the
record
that
--
that
sometime
between
1939
and
1943,
the
corporation,
which
as
far
as
i
can
make
out,
had
only
surplus
account
prior
to
that
time,
readjusted
it's
surplus
in
some
way
and
apparently
divided
it
between
an
earned
surplus
account
and
a
capital
surplus
account.
the
corporation
did
not
treat
this
$400,000
as
taxable
income
but
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
held
that
it
was
taxable
as
a
long-term
capital
gain.
the
respondent
contended
and
the
court
of
claims
held
that
under
the
applicable
statute
and
the
regulations,
this
$400,000
was
not
income
at
all
and
therefore
of
course
not
subject
to
tax.
among
the
findings
made
by
the
court
of
claims
were
several
findings
which
i
think
amount
to
conclusions
of
fact.
one
being
that
the
purchased
of
these
shares
by
the
corporation,
amounted
to
a
withdrawal
by
the
selling
stockholder
of
his
share
of
the
earnings
accumulated
during
the
period
of
his
ownership
of
the
stock.
and
that
the
resale
of
the
shares
in
1943
by
the
corporation
amounted
to
a
contribution
of
capital
by
the
purchaser
of
the
shares
equal
to
accumulated
earnings
so
as
to
equalize
the
common
equity
of
all
of
the
stockholders.
the
court
of
claims
also
made
a
finding
that
the
shares
were
not
purchased
by
the
corporation
for
investment
or
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
in
its
own
shares
as
it
might
in
the
stock
of
another
corporation.
now,
that
latter
finding
has
reference
to
a
provision
of
the
regulations
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
the
record
doesn't
indicate
sir
--
actually
there
wasn't
any
market.
i
think
this
was
a
very
closely
held
stock
and
i
think
there
was
no
market.
the
applicable
statute
of
cost
is
section
22
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
the
definition
of
gross
income
which
defines
gross
income
as
including
gains
or
profits
and
income
derived
from
any
source
whatever.
that's
the
catch-all
provision
which
the
court
end
up,
head
into
consideration
last
term
in
the
two
cases
that
i
mentioned.
this
court
has
said
with
respect
to
that
catch-all
provision
that
evidences
--
the
intention
of
congress
to
exert
its
taxing
power
to
the
fullest.
the
court
has
also
pointed
out
that
the
language
of
that
provision
is
so
general
that
an
interpretative
regulation
is
appropriate
and
almost
since
the
beginning
of
the
income
tax
law,
the
regulations
have
dealt
with
this
question
of
the
tax
effect
of
the
transactions
by
a
corporation
in
its
own
share.
at
the
beginning
or
almost
at
the
beginning
under
the
revenue
act
of
1917,
the
regulations
flatly
provided
that
gain
was
realized
by
a
corporation
when
it's
sold
shares
which
it
had
held
in
its
treasury.
however
in
--
or
under
the
1918
act,
the
treasury
department
apparently
change
his
mind
because
it
promulgated
a
new
regulation
which
said
in
effect
that
the
proceeds
of
sale
of
the
treasury
shares
should
be
regarded
as
capital
and
not
income
and
therefore,
of
course
not
subject
to
income
tax.the
rule
remained
that
way,
so
far
as
the
regulations
were
concerned
from
about
1918
until
1934.
in
1934,
as
a
result
of
some
court
decisions
which
had
thrown
some
doubt
on
the
correctness
of
the
regulations
at
least
in
other
respects.
the
treasury
department
promulgated
a
so-called
treasury
decision
4430
which
later
became
a
part
of
the
regulations
and
which
is
the
regulation
applicable
in
this
case.
that
is
reproduced
on
page
3
of
the
governments
brief
and
in
view
of
its
importance
to
a
case,
i
think
perhaps
i
should
read
it.
it
says,
“whether
the
acquisition
or
disposition
by
a
corporation
of
shares
of
its
capital
stock
gives
rise
to
taxable
gain
or
deductible
loss
depends
upon
the
real
nature
of
the
transaction
which
is
to
be
ascertain
from
all
its
facts
and
circumstances.”
the
receipt
by
a
corporation
of
the
subscription
price
of
shares
of
its
capital
stock
upon
their
original
issuance
gives
rise
to
neither
taxable
gain
nor
deductible
loss
whether
the
subscription
or
issue
price
be
in
excess
of
or
less
than
the
prior
or
stated
value
of
such
stock.
but,
if
a
corporation
deals
in
its
own
shares
as
it
might
in
the
shares
of
another
corporation,
the
resulting
gain
or
loss
is
to
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
well
as
the
corporation
were
dealing
in
the
shares
of
another.
so,
also
if
the
corporation
receives
its
own
stock
as
consideration
upon
the
sale
of
property
by
it
or
in
satisfaction
of
indebtedness
to
it,
the
gain
or
loss
resulting
is
to
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
though
the
payment
had
been
made
in
any
other
property.
any
gain
derived
from
such
transaction
is
subject
to
tax
and
any
loss
sustained
is
allowable
as
a
deduction
that
were
permitted
by
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
this
court
had
the
section
of
the
regulations
or
a
predecessor
which
was
substantially
identical
with
it.
before
it,
in
the
reynolds
tobacco
company
case
which
was
decided,
i
think,
in
the
year
1939.
however,
the
question
involved
in
that
case
had
to
do
only
with
the
retroactive
application
of
this
change
in
the
regulations
which
as
i
have
said
took
place
in
1934.
the
treasury
decision
purported
to
make
the
new
regulation
retroactive
as
far
back,
i
think,
as
1924
or
1926,
the
transaction
involved
in
the
reynolds
tobacco
case
have
taken
place
in
1929
and
the
question
was
whether
the
new
regulation
or
the
old
regulation
applied
to
that
transaction.
the
court
held
that
the
old
rule
the
pre-1934
rule
under
which
a
corporation
was
held
to
realize
either
gained
or
loss
on
the
sale
of
treasury
stock
had
acquired
the
force
of
law
through
repeated
reenactment
of
the
underlying
statute
without
any
substantial
change,
and
that
therefore
the
new
regulation
could
not
govern
the
tax
consequences
of
a
transaction
which
took
place
in
1929,
five
years
before
it
was
adopted.
the
court
expressly
reframes
from
passing
on
the
question
whether
the
rule
of
the
old
regulation
could
be
altered
for
the
future
by
administrative
action
or
whether
legislative
action
was
necessary.
however,
in
later
cases
such
as
the
wilshire
oil
case
in
--
in
volume
308
and
the
reynolds
case,
not
the
reynolds
tobacco
case,
the
reynolds
case
in
volume
313,
the
court
did
deal
with
that
question
of
a
prospective
change
in
regulations
and
held
that
administrative
regulations,
even
though
buttress
by
repeated
reenactment
of
the
underlying
statute
did
not
become
so
completely
frozen
into
the
law
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
a
change
for
the
future
through
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
administrative
rule
making
power.
the
court
of
claims
in
the
instant
case
didn't
expressly
pass
on
this
question
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation
because
it
found
it
possible
to
decide
the
case
in
the
taxpayer's
favor
on
other
grounds.
however,
in
an
earlier
decision
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
governments
brief,
cited
in
1945
which
involved
this
regulation.
the
court
of
claims
expressly
approved
the
regulation,
sustained
its
validity
and
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
there
have
been
six
of
them
which
have
considered
this
question
of
the
validity
of
the
new
regulation
have
sustained
it.
and
i
submit
that
in
the
light
of
the
wilshire
oil
and
the
reynolds
cases,
there
can't
be
any
doubt
about
the
power
of
the
treasury
department
to
change
the
rule
for
the
future,
notwithstanding
the
implied
congressional
approval
of
the
earlier
rule.
the
court
of
claims
--
what
the
court
of
claims
held
was
that
under
what
it
considered
to
be
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
regulations,
this
$400,000
excess
of
the
proceeds
of
sale
of
these
treasury
shares,
over
their
cost
to
the
corporation
was
not
income
because
as
the
court
of
claims
construed
the
regulation,
the
respondent
corporation
engaging
in
these
transactions
and
it's
own
stock
was
not
dealing
in
it's
own
shares
as
it
might
in
the
shares
of
another
corporation.
and
the
reason
that
the
court
of
claims
gave
for
that
conclusion,
the
principal
reasons
were
these.
it
said
first
that
the
corporation
did
not
purchased
these
shares
at
opportune
times
that
is
it
wasn't
purchasing
--
purchasing
them
with
a
view
to
striking
a
bargain
or
for
what
the
hope
of
getting
them
cheap
and
making
a
profit
on
them
at
latter
date.
second
reason
it
gave
was,
that
in
--
in
purchasing
the
shares
the
corporation
was
fulfilling
a
contractual
obligation
that
is
the
obligation
under
this
1931
agreement
to
purchase
the
shares
held
by
the
estate
of
the
deceased
stockholder.
the
third
reason
that
it
gave
was,
that
the
time
of
the
resale
of
the
shares
was
not
dictated
by
the
potentiality
of
profit.
in
other
words,
the
shares
were
not
resold
by
the
corporation
because
it
could
get
a
good
price
for
them,
but
they
were
resold
in
accordance
with
its
policy
of
the
distributing
shares
among
the
management
group.
the
court
also
stressed
the
fact
that
the
overall
purposed
of
the
purchases
and
the
resales
was
not
to
make
a
profit
but
to
restrict
the
ownership
of
the
stock
and
to
provide
an
incentive
to
the
management.
in
brief,
the
court
of
claims
took
the
view
of
the
regulations
which
has
been
rejected
by
--
as
i
have
said
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
the
question,
namely
that
a
corporation
is
to
be
deemed
as
dealing
in
its
own
stock
as
it
might
in
the
stock
of
another
corporation
only
if
it
is
engaging
in
transactions
in
its
own
shares
with
a
profit
motive
typically,
when
it
buys
and
sells
it
shares
on
the
open
market.
now,
strangely
enough
in
its
earlier
decision
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
the
court
said
here
without
any
explanation
was
distinguishable
on
its
facts.
in
its
earlier
decision
in
that
case,
the
court
had
relied
on
some
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions,
the
reasoning
of
which
it
now
repudiates.
the
--
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
other
hand
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
this
regulation
is
that
the
motive
with
which
shares
of
stock
of
a
corporation
are
bought
or
sold
by
the
corporation
is
immaterial.
that
it's
immaterial
that
purchases
on
sales
are
made
in
the
fulfillment
of
some
contractual
obligation
that
the
corporation
may
have
assumed
that
what
is
important
and
the
only
thing
that's
important
is
what
the
corporation
does,
and
not
why
it
doesn't.
the
distinction
that
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
the
more
articulate
opinions
in
the
court
of
appeals
draw
--
the
distinction
that
is
drawn
between
taxable
and
non-taxable
transactions
by
a
court
in
--
in
dealings
by
a
corporation
in
its
own
stock,
is
the
distinction
between
transactions
which
involved
an
adjustment
of
the
corporations
capital
structure
and
those
which
don't
involve
an
adjustment
of
the
corporation's
capital
structure.
that
this
is
the
distinction
that
the
regulations
seek
to
draw,
i
think,
is
indicated
by
the
origin
of
the
regulation.
the
change
in
1934,
followed
upon
decisions
of
several
of
the
courts,
particularly,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
the
s.
a.
woods
machine
company
case
in
1932
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
language
that
this
case
revolves
around
that
if
a
corporation
deals
in
it's
own
shares,
as
it
might
in
the
shares
of
another
corporation
was
lifted
almost
verbatim
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
that
woods
machine
company
case.
that
case
involved
a
somewhat
different
question,
the
question
in
that
case
the
corporation
had
accepted
shares
of
its
own
stock
held
by
one
of
its
shareholders.
in
settlement
of
a
claim
which
it
had
against
the
stockholder
for
a
patent
infringement
and
the
question
was,
whether
in
receiving
those
shares
in
that
manner
and
for
that
purpose,
the
corporation
realized
income.
the
court
of
appeals
reversing
the
court
of
tax
appeals
said
that
it
did
and
it's
opinion
it
drew
this
distinction,
which
i
have
mentioned
between
capital
transactions
which
it
defined
as
being
transactions
in
connection
with
readjustment
of
the
corporation's
capital
structure
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
transactions
not
connected
with
the
readjustment
of
the
corporation's
capital
structure
which
it
defined
as
transactions
in
which
the
corporation
deals
in
its
own
shares
as
it
might
in
the
shares
of
another.
that
is
transactions
in
which
the
stock
of
the
corporation
is
treated
essentially
no
matter
what
--
what
the
correct
theory
maybe,
but
it's
treated
as
practical
matter
essentially
as
though
it
were
any
other
kind
of
an
asset.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
well,
i
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
i
think
it
means
buying
and
selling
its
own
shares
as
it
might
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
--
say
as
to
another
corporation.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
well,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
a
question
of
what
--
what
you
do.
of
course
if
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
the
--
the
authority
is
part
of
it
and
this
corporation
have
the
authority
both
under
the
delaware
law
and
under
its
own
charter.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
no.
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
no.
they
weren't.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
but
what
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
well
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
what
--
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was,
that
the
--
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
can
be
determined
by
seeing
the
context
in
which
it
was
used
in
its
--
in
the
place
it
originally
came
from
which
is
in
this
decision
of
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
where
the
court
attempted
to
draw
this
distinction
between
the
transactions
and
stock,
which
are
connected
with
the
readjustment
of
capital
structure.
that
would
be
typically
an
original
issue
of
stock
or
reduction
of
capital
on
the
one
hand
and
transactions
of
all
other
kinds
which
the
court
described
in
this
language,
which
we
now
find
in
the
regulations,
that
is
dealing
in
its
own
shares
as
it
might
in
--
in
any
kind
of
an
asset.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
well,
i
think
as
the
regulation
says
it
would
depend
on
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
h.
brian
holland
well
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
they
--
they
held
it
in
a
--
in
a
so-called
treasury
stock
account
so
that
--
mr.
h.
brian
holland
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that's
an
arguable
question.
ordinarily,
i
agree
that
if
a
corporation
retires
shares
in
the
formal
sense
and
reduces
its
capital
and
then
sometime
later
for
some
reason
decides
to
--
to
issue
some
more
shares
that
--
that
would
not
be
considered
a
--
a
transaction
in
which
taxable
gain
would
be
involved.
on
the
one
hand,
if
there
is
such
a
relationship
between
the
purchase
on
the
one
hand
and
then
there
--
the
issue
of
the
new
shares,
i
mean
if
they
all
seems
to
be
a
part
of
--
of
one
plan
then
i
think
perhaps
a
different
result
might
be
justified.
