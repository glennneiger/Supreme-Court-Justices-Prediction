mr.
john
c.
white
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
fall
of
1943,
in
anderson,
clayton
after
reviewing
its
operations,
concluded
that
certain
men
had
--
had
and
were
contributing
considerably
more
to
the
management
operations
of
the
business.
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
greater
participation
in
earnings.
mr.
holland
has
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
management
business
and
whether
it
makes
a
profit
or
not,
depends
on
the
experience
and
the
ability
of
the
management
and
therefore,
that
subject
has
required
constant
attention
from
the
corporation.
to
accomplish
this
purpose
of
giving
these
men
a
greater
participation
in
earning,
the
directors
approved
the
sale
to
them
of
the
6500
shares
of
treasury
stock,
at
a
price
of
a
$112.68
a
share.
now,
that
price
was
determined
by
an
analysis
of
the
surplus
of
the
corporation,
which
was
prescribed
by
the
charter
itself.
that
charter
is
a
very
unusual
charter,
it's
very
difficult
to
work
out
and
it's
worked
only
in
connection
with
a
stockholders
agreement
also.
but
the
price
of
a
$112.68
was
just
the
representative
of
what
had
been
accumulated
by
the
corporation
in
the
way
of
earnings
prior
to
the
transfer
to
these
shareholders.
now,
they
had
held
some
stock
previously,
but
these
were
additional
amounts
to
most
of
them.
they
gave
for
these
shares
their
demand
notes
under
which
they
had
the
right
to
attorney
stock
in
settlement
of
a
note
or
to
pay
the
amount
which
was
$112.68
per
share.
the
treasury
stock
had
been
acquired
at
the
death
of
mr.
anderson
and
at
that
time
its
share
--
his
share
in
the
distributed
or
undistributed
earnings
was
$50.79
or
that
amount
less
$1.
this
stock
was
originally
issued
to
him
at
$1
a
share
and
he
received
$943,373.46
for
it
or
his
estate
received
that
because
that
was
the
earnings
which
had
been
accumulated
while
he
owned
it
and
under
the
--
the
contract
while
he
was
entitled
to
share
in
those
earnings.
taxpayers
approach
to
this
problem
has
been
a
simple
one.we
raised
no
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
treasury
regulations.
we
simply
said
to
the
court
of
claims,
"apply
the
treasury
regulations
to
the
facts
of
this
case."
now,
there
was
little
controversy
as
to
the
facts
either.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
joint
request
for
findings
of
fact
and
the
court
followed
that
request
almost
verbatim
including
this
finding
that
in
substance,
these
transactions
involved
in
the
case
of
purchases
by
the
corporation,
a
withdrawal
of
the
earnings
and
the
--
for
the
fact
that
in
the
case
of
sales
by
the
corporation,
it
amounted
to
contribution
of
capital
and
the
deposited
earnings
by
deposit
of
the
same
amount
which
other
common
stockholders
had
at
risk
from
that
day
forward.
when
we
turn
to
the
regulations,
we
say
that
the
real
nature
of
the
transaction
must
be
ascertained
from
all
its
facts
and
circumstances
and
that
among
those,
is
did
the
taxpayer
deal
in
its
own
stock
as
it
might
those
of
another
corporation.
this
regulation
under
the
helvering
versus
r.j.
reynolds
tobacco
case
is
certainly,
it
seems
to
me,
an
order.
true
they
left
--
you
left
open
there
the
question
of
whether
a
rule
which
should
become
incorporated
in
the
statute
could
be
changed
by
regulation
rather
than
by
congress.
but
in
the
wilshire
case,
you
seem
to
say
that
for
the
future
a
regulation
can
be
changed.
but
we
said
to
the
court
and
we
say
to
this
court
that
the
regulation
was
not
changed
insofar
as
it
applies
to
this
particular
case
and
to
the
facts
which
the
court
of
claims
found
here.
now,
just
about
the
time
this
case
we
decided,
congress
had
this
subject
onto
consideration
and
it
enacted
the
rule
which
the
court
of
claims
put
into
effect
here.
it
said
that
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
to
a
corporation
on
the
receipt
of
money
or
other
property
in
exchange
for
stock
including
treasury
stock
of
such
corporation.
that
is
in
the
1954
act
and,
of
course,
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
particular
transaction.
the
committee
reports
pointed
out
that
on
the
present
law
whether
the
disposition
by
a
corporation
of
shares
of
its
own
capital
stock
gives
rise
to
taxable
gain
or
deductable
loss
depends
under
certain
decisions.
those
were
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
were
four
which
had
reversed
tax
court
decisions
upon
whether
the
transaction
constitutes
a
dealing
by
a
corporation
in
its
own
share,
which
is
to
be
ascertained
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
that
seemed
to
us
to
say,
that
so
far
as
congress
is
concerned
the
rule
was
it,
the
question
depends
on
whether
the
corporation
dealt
in
its
own
stock
as
it
might
dealt
with
another
corporation.
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
remove
the
uncertainties
of
the
present
law.now,
turning
to
the
facts,
we've
said
that
for
three
reasons
here
the
corporation
did
not
deal
any
stock
as
it
would
to
have
another
corporation
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
stock,
because
of
the
used
made
of
it
and
because
of
the
effect.
its
nature
i
have
already
pointed
out
it
was
unique,
it
was
issued
at
$1
a
share,
back
of
some
$25
million
of
6.5%
preferred
originally.
at
this
time,
it
stood
back
of
16
million
long-term
debentures
and
32
million
preferred
stocks
which
were
--
both
of
which
were
irredeemable.
there
were
no
preemptive
rights,
none
of
the
charters
the
directors
have
had
and
were
given
full
discretion
as
to
the
persons
to
whom
it
could
be
issued
and
the
price
that
which
it
could
be
issued.
if
it
were
retired,
as
justice
reed
suggested,
it
could
be
immediately
reissued
at
any
price,
the
directors
might
think
it
was
appropriate.
mr.
john
c.
white
as
to
the
--
we
think
that
again
that
is
one
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
the
court
of
claims
was
required
by
this
regulation
to
consider
and
i
don't'
know
that
the
change
in
that
one
fact
would
change
the
total
picture.
but
because
this
is,
in
its
nature,
so
very
unique
and
obviously
can
be
used
only
for
a
purpose
of
this
sort,
it
has
no
marketable
value.
that
it
was
not
permitted
to
be
marketed
that
we
think
that
that
is
an
important
fact.
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
that
we've
come
out
the
other
way,
but
that
is
a
strongly
supporting
fact.
another
feature
of
this
stock
was
that
after
1938,
when
a
company
was
reorganized
that
it
had
in
a
sense,
a
preference
of
its
own.
after
4%
accumulated
was
earned
on
preferred,
then
$5
a
share
on
its
share
of
this
common
was
turned
over
to
a
common
stock
surplus
which
was
setup
by
the
charter
itself
on
the
books
of
the
corporation.
and
that
$5
plus
4%
on
the
amount
in
the
common
stock
surplus
was
a
preference
to
common.
then
after
that
had
been
set
aside,
preferred
got
one-half
of
the
remainder
of
the
earnings
and
these
100,000
shares
of
common
got
the
other
half
of
the
earnings.
now,
as
i
say
we
--
we
think
that
the
nature
of
the
stock
is
important,
then
its
holding
was
limited
to
the
actual
participating
management.
upon
the
death,
it
was
retired
immediately
and
automatically
under
the
contract
at
a
price
which
was
designed
to
approximate
the
earnings
of
the
corporation
during
the
period
the
man
had
held
the
stock.
it
was
subject
to
reallocation
if
the
management
concluded
that
mr.
(inaudible)
and
mr.
(inaudible)
wasn't
earning
and
wasn't
performing
functions
which
entitled
him
to
the
amount
he
was
receiving,
he
could
be
directed
to
sell
it
to
transfer
to
someone
else.
if
mr.
(inaudible)
decided
that
he
was
tired
of
the
business
and
wished
to
retire,
he
could
turn
it
back
into
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
was
legally
obligated
to
distribute
to
him
in
payment
the
amount
which
has
been
earned
while
he
held
that
stock.
in
short,
there's
a
tax
court
found
in
an
earlier
case
involving
same
stock
and
at
8
t.c.706,
and
by
the
way
these
findings
of
the
tax
court,
a
part
of
the
record
here
by
stipulation,
this
stock
was
not
marketable
but
for
use
to
distribute
profits
in
proportion
to
active
participation
in
business.
it
was
not
only
designed
for
that
purpose,
it
was
used
for
it
while
before
anderson's
death,
23,000
shares
had
been
transferred
by
mr.
w.a.
clayton
and
mr.
m.d.
anderson
to
junior
members
of
the
management
because
those
junior
members
of
the
management
were
assuming
greater
responsibility
and
performing
more
important
duty.
the
payments
made
out
for
the
stock
was
solely
made
in
case
of
death
and
in
the
case
of
m.d.
anderson
as
i
say,
he
received
$900,000
more
than
he
originally
paid
for.
sales
made
by
the
corporation
which
were
of
this
stock
which
has
been
acquired
in
the
case
of
death
or
acquired
of
that
stock
were
made
only
to
management.
now,
as
the
affected
of
the
transaction
that's
been
indicated
in
part
but
this
stock
was
issued
for
$18,574.
corporation
paid
$943,000
for
it.
it
immediately
sold
or
shortly
thereafter
sold
3000
shares
of
it
at
less
than
it
paid
for
it
because
of
a
change
in
the
common
stock
surplus.
if
the
loss
was
not
deducted,
the
loss
--
there'd
be
a
loss
because
it
was
regarded
as
a
capital
transaction.
then
the
--
this
6500
shares
was
sold
for
the
$732,000
derived
in
a
way
i
have
pointed
out.
it
was
treated
on
the
books
of
the
capital
transaction.
the
$732,000
was
entered
into
the
common
--
charged
to
the
common
stock
surplus
of
the
corporation.
i
have
mentioned
the
findings
of
--
mr.
holland
also
did,
that
in
substance,
this
was
in
the
case
of
purchases
by
the
corporation,
a
withdrawal
of
earnings
and
in
the
case
sales
a
contribution
of
capital.
and
the
fact,
that
these
findings
were
jointly
requested
by
the
taxpayer
and
the
government.
so,
we
have
said
that
the
fact
as
they
are
and
as
the
court
--
as
the
government
agreed
they
were
and
as
the
court
of
claims
found
them,
brought
that
court
to
deflect
questions
whether
the
fact
that
shares
acquired
back
from
m.d.
anderson
were
not
legally
retired,
legally
compelled
the
decision
for
the
government
regardless
of
all
other
facts
and
circumstances
and
regardless
of
the
substance
of
the
transaction
which
it
had
placed
before
it.
that
was
frankly
an
open
position
of
the
government
and
the
court
below.
despite
government
active
thoughts,
the
taxpayer
believed
that,
that
must
be
the
government
position
here.
the
--
this
court
has
recognized
that
findings
of
fact
to
the
court
of
claims
are
either
binding
on
it
or
at
least
entitled
to
the
greatest
respect.
and
of
course
so
far
as
any
tax
or
trial
tribunal
is
concerned,
it
has
recognized
that
the
facts
found
by
them
are
to
be
respected
in
such
cases,
(inaudible).
i
think
the
care
with
which
the
court
of
claims
examined
the
facts
here
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
this
decision
was
written
by
judge
littleton
who
wrote
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
the
government
counsel
mentioned.
the
both
decisions
by
the
way
were
unanimous.
judge
littleton
brought
the
facts
in
that
case,
justified
--
making
it
taxable
and
the
facts
in
this
case
showed
that
the
transaction
was
--
did
not
amount
to
dealing
in
its
stock
as
it
would
those
of
another
corporation.
so
far
as
that
question
of
whether
it's
traded
share
or
an
issue
to
shares
that
are
sold.
it
seemed
to
us
and
the
court
points
out
that
that's
the
question
of
mechanics
of
form
rather
than
substance
under
these
particular
facts
where
$1
a
share
was
the
total
capital
involved
on
--
in
connection
with
the
stock
whether
the
corporation
actually
retired
that
stock
was
meaningless
from
every
economic
point
of
view.
this
treasury
stock
too
had
none
of
the
important
qualities
of
--
of
stock
while
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
corporation.
it
couldn't
--
it
didn't
vote,
it
couldn't
be
counted
for
forum,
it
didn't
receive
any
dividends
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
investor
would
pay
a
cent
more
for
it
than
for
the
property
of
the
corporation
because
it
held
the
stock
in
its
treasury.
we've
also
pointed
out
that
in
other
tax
fields,
the
government
has
treated
this
question
of
whether
treasury
stock
is
unimportant.
and
the
question
of
stock
dividends
for
instance,
originally
attempted
to
say
that
treasury
stock
is
property
and
therefore
when
it's
distributed
it
is
taxable,
even
though
the
stock
dividends
paid
from
an
issued
stock
are
not
taxable.
that
was
decided
against
it
by
the
tax
court
in
the
bruckheimer
case
and
then
the
treasury
in
p.d.
5290,
went
along
with
the
decision
of
the
tax
court.
in
the
question
of
whether
a
--
a
particular
purchase
or
redemption
is
equivalent
to
a
dividend,
the
courts
have
held
that
the
question
of
whether
the
stock
is
retained,
the
retired
is
unimportant.
and
then
the
case
of
invested
capital
again
it
has
indicated
that
it
regards
that
question
is
unimportant.
i
might
also
say,
that
so
far
as
the
s.
e.
c.
is
concerned
it
--
it
is
required
that
treasury
stock
be
treated
as
a
not
being
property
and
it's
also
required
that
any
income
made
from
it
be
placed
in
a
capital
account
rather
than
placed
in
earned
surplus.
we
have
thus
concluded
that
in
substance
of
this
transaction,
insofar
as
the
corporation
is
concerned
was
its
receipt
of
this
$112.68
under
---
under
a
binding
agreement
to
return
it
to
the
payor
upon
his
demand
or
if
he
wish
to,
he
could
turn
it
back
to
the
corporation
in
payment
of
his
notes.
it's
difficult
to
see
how
the
corporation
made
any
profit
from
this
contract.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
other
stockholders,
if
you
look
at
the
corporation
as
being
an
irrigation
of
stockholders,
it's
equally
difficult
to
see
how
they
profited
when
all
the
contribution
affected
was
an
equalization
of
the
position
of
the
two
--
of
--
of
these
new
shareholders
with
those
of
the
stock,
then
outstanding.
mr.
john
c.
white
no.
so
far
--
so
far
as
the
other
stockholders
were
concerned
they
were
left
in
the
exactly
the
same
position
because
as
the
--
under
the
charter
and
as
this
value
was
calculated
it
was
$112.68
a
share,
the
value
that
each
one
of
their
share
is
representing.
now,
assume
that
this
was
sold,
each
share
still
represented
$112.68
per
share
so
that,
it
meant
nothing
to
the
other
stockholders.
the
government
in
this
brief
and
mr.
holland
both
indicated
that
they
have
a
question
as
to
whether
the
view
or
purpose
for
which
the
transaction
is
entered
is
of
any
importance.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
question
of
gifts.
this
court
said
its
important.
the
question
of
whether
a
man
is
a
traitor
or
a
dealer,
it's
regarded
as
very
important.
the
question
of
hedging
is
regarded
as
rather
important
whether
or
not
he
has
a
motive
of
balancing
his
risks
or
not.
in
the
questions
of
whether
a
certain
payment
to
a
corporation
is
a
contribution
to
capital,
the
motive
is
also
of
considerable
importance.
and
now,
as
to
the
court
of
appeals
decisions,
actually
no
court
of
appeals
decision
involved
this
question
so
closely
until
long
after
the
transaction
here
involved
took
place.
the
tax
court's
decision
for
uniformity
and
along
the
lines
of
the
court
of
claims
decision
and
it
was
not
until
later
that
any
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
those
cases.
we
have
felt
that
these
courts
of
appeals
did
not
really
analyze
the
regulations
in
a
way
that
the
court
of
claims
did.
now,
the
--
through
it,
the
regulation
originated
with
the
woods
decision
that
wood's
decision
can
be
supported
only
the
ground
that
the
corporation
sold
a
property
or
right
of
another
sort
and
received
its
stock
in
exchange.
it
kept
that
stock
--
stock
by
the
way
and
did
not
retire
and
the
new
regulation
--
mr.
john
c.
white
the
tax
court,
the
same
day
about
that
this
court
of
claims
handed
down
its
decision,
threw
up
its
hands
and
said,
cited
four
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
and
went
along
with
them.
but
it
did
not
admit
that
it
was
wrong,
i
would
say
[laughter]
in
its
analysis
of
even
those
facts.
and
i
might
say
this
again
that
i
believe
that
there
are
no
other
facts
comparable
to
those
that
are
involved
in
this
case
in
any
of
the
tax
court
decision.
mr.
john
c.
white
yes.
mr.
john
c.
white
i
think
it
--
it
would
certainly
be
a
--
a
different
fact
situation,
but
the
question
to
my
mind
is
--
is
open.
you
have
said
that
whether
or
not
a
transaction
is
capital
or
income
that
in
the
gain
derived
from
labor
or
--
or
from
capital
or
that
including
from
a
sale
or
conversion
of
capital
assets.
well,
now
there's
a
question
where
their
treasury
shares
in
the
hands
of
the
corporation
are
capital
assets
or
assets
of
any
nature.
there
are
decisions
in
justice
--
judge
learned
hand
has
insisted
in
great
many
cases
that
it's
a
--
meaningless
to
say
that
the
corporation
holding
its
own
stock
has
anything
because
it
hasn't
any
dividends,
it
hasn't
any
right
to
vote,
it
had
--
has
only
the
chance
of
disposing
of
it
for
renewing
a
contract
to
some
other
shareholders.
in
the
stock
dividend
cases,
it's
where
the
government
first
said
here
as
an
asset,
they
abandoned
that
position.
so,
i
--
i
would
say
that
--
that
there
is
a
question
as
a
court
of
claims
have,
as
to
whether
any
dealing
in
treasury
stock
is
not
a
capital
transaction.
mr.
john
c.
white
i
think
first
that,
the
dow
chemical
case
might
be
taken
into
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
some
facts
about
like
that.
and
the
court
said,
that
it
could
not
imagine
facts
more
like
those
of
dealing
in
another
corporation
stock
that
were
involved
in
that
case.
the
corporation
simply
went
into
the
market
and
bought
some
shares
and
then
later
time
sold
them.
it
had
--
it
treated
as
if
it
were
an
asset
on
its
books.
its
purpose
was
to
realize
the
profit
because
they
thought
the
shares
were
low
at
that
time.
it
sold
them
their
profit.
there
to
my
mind
is
the
type
of
case
which
this
regulation
is
designed
to
cover
and
which
it
may
properly
cover.
although
as
i
say,
the
court
of
claims
indicates
that
it
had
a
sincere
doubt
as
to
whether
any
transaction
in
treasury
shares
could
be
regarded
as
taxable
rather
than
capital
in
nature.
mr.
john
c.
white
the
question
of
what
increase
in
value
is
of
a
--
of
a
nonexistent
--
mr.
john
c.
white
--
chosen
action
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
white
yes,
it
is
my
point.
mr.
john
c.
white
there
was
that
much
greater
share
in
--
mr.
john
c.
white
in
the
future
earnings.
mr.
john
c.
white
that's
correct.
it
affected
--
his
death
meant
that
the
members
(inaudible)
who
were
previously
getting
say
5%
might
being
--
now
getting
6%
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
white
for
--
for
instance,
this
sale
of
6500
share
was
only
84,000
outstanding
meant
that
common
stockholder
are
that
--
that
there
was
50,000
additional
preference
to
this
--
this
common
stockholder
and
it
meant
that
each
of
the
--
mr.
john
c.
white
well,
you
mean
escape
of
redistribution
of
--
of
future
earnings.
mr.
john
c.
white
anytime
you
retire
shares
or
anytime
you
reissue
them,
you
effect
that
same
redistribution.
nothing
in
the
world
except
none
recognition
of
its
importance
--
mr.
john
c.
white
if
in
--
except
from
the
strict
legal
point
of
view
it
was
because
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
the
stock
became
meaningless
and
serve
no
purpose.
it
could
have
been
--
we
could
have
retired
it
and
reissue
--
resold
this
--
reissued
this
without
any
difficulty
whatsoever
other
than
(inaudible)
mechanics.
mr.
john
c.
white
none
whatever.
mr.
john
c.
white
yes.
we
had
absolute
control
of
both
the
stock
in
the
treasury
and
the
stock
in
the
unissued
stock
if
--
if
this
has
been
retired.
no
preemptive
rights
and
with
the
director's
being
given
full
responsibility
for
its
reissuance.
thank
you,
sir.
