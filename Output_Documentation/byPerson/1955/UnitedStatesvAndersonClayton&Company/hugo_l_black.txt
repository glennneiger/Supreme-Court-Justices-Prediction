may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
has
been
just
regular
stock
and
it
didn't
have
these
conditions
that
you
speak
of,
that
you
possibly
point
out.
they
have
both
the
--
the
exact
amount
of
stocks
all
together
(inaudible).
they've
held
that
this
is
a
waste
of
time,
then
had
sold
as
to
this
same
officials
for
the
price
they
did
or
(inaudible).
i
think
it
was
sold
or
whatever
it
was.
would
you
say
that
it
was
taxable
under
the
regulation
involved,
for
the
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
if
it's
just
a
regular
corporate
--
say
the
texas
company
buys
6000
shares
of
its
stocks
(inaudible).
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
right
in
that,
all
the
stockholders
preceding
the
company
would
have
to
pay
any
increase
of
value
and
all
those
stockholders
who
could
preceded
the
ownership
of
the
company
would
have
to
pay
but
there
would
be
no
tax
collected
for
the
increase
value
during
the
time
the
company
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
claim
that
there
had
been
no
--
consequences
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
anybody.
