(inaudible)
unknown

what
do
you
--
what
do
you
understand
in
that
provision
the
regulation
to
mean,
where
it
says
it
may
deal
as
it
may
deal
with
the
shares
of
another
corporation?
what's
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
just
simply
mean
the
power
to
buy?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
to
--
unknown
speaker
--
if
it
just
have
the
power
to
buy
the
shares
of
your
corporation
and
--
and
the
--
and
have
the
power
to
buy
shares
of
another
corporation,
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
that
was
done
here,
wasn't
it?
they
just
bought
their
own
stock.
unknown
speaker
they
were
speculating
in
--
unknown
speaker
--
they
were
buying
it
for
an
investment?
unknown
speaker
they
bought
it
for
the
three
specific
purposes
that
the
court
of
claims
said
they
bought
it.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
--
i
--
i'm
wondering
what
the
--
what
that
--
what
that
means,
is
what
you
have
to
--
have
to
--
to
show
as
to
dealing
with
other
shares.
unknown
speaker
how
much
dealing
must
there
be?
unknown
speaker
how
much
dealing
must
there
be?
unknown
speaker
mr.
holland,
what
--
what
would
be
the
difference
between
purchasing
if
--
if
they
had
reduced
their
capital
and
that
have
been
sold
--
increase
the
capital
again
at
a
higher
price
of
shares.
would
that
been
just
like
this
transaction?
unknown
speaker
well,
take
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
instead
of
carrying
this
stock
in
--
in
their
treasury
as
i
understand
it
then,
they
have
to
use
the
amount
of
capital
understanding
of
shares
outstanding
of
the
amount
they
bought.
and
later
reinstated
the
original
amount
and
had
sold
at
the
price
that
they
received
for
these
shares
that
they
sold.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
they
did
put
it
into
a
surplus
account.
unknown
speaker
if
they
--
if
they've
done
what
i
suggest,
there
would
not
have
been
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
stock
had
not
had
these
special
provisions,
would
then
would
you
come
out
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
a
problem
--
between
the
time
that
the
corporation
acquired
the
stock
when
it
sold
it
while
the
--
the
stock
that
was
in
the
treasury
went
for
and
decided
this
the
same
as
the
other
stock.
it
didn't
belong
to
the
other
people.
it
didn't
belong
to
the
present
stockholders.
they
get
an
addition
when
they
sold?
unknown
speaker
the
tax
court
has
now
joined
the
court
of
appeals
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
understand
why
--
why
there
wasn't
a
profit
made
during
this
time
of
--
that
they
held
a
stock
with
the
sale
because
the
corporation,
i'm
going
to
say,
earned
a
million
dollars
the
--
before
this,
they
divide
it
among
all
the
shareholders
including
mr.
anderson.
now,
when
that
stock
went
into
treasury,
it
no
longer
have
to
pay
dividends
(inaudible).
is
that
much
more
to
the
other
people.
unknown
speaker
much
greater
income
to
--
unknown
speaker
in
the
future
earnings.
unknown
speaker
--
they're
just
doubled.
unknown
speaker
it's
--
it's
only
when
you
consider
it
does
--
as
the
court
of
claims
did,
as
i
understand
it,
as
a
retirement
and
a
further
issuance
of
shares
to
escape
the
earnings
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
--
simply
a
retirement
and
a
reissue.
