justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress,
instead
of
doing
this,
has
defined
the
attempts,
said
that
the
judge
shall
submit
to
the
jury
the
power
to
determine
whether
it's
guilty
of
the
felony
or
the
misdeamenor,
and
the
court
shall
fix
prices
accordingly,
would
that
be
a
valid
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
claimed
that.
suppose
they
just
provide
that
they
jury
can
as
it
do
in
many
state,
fix
punishment
and
committed
of
the
crime
with
the
punishment,
either
five
years
or
six
months,
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
congress
doesn't
do
that?
couldn't
let
the
jury
fix
the
punishment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
just
one
attempt
there,
just
take
one
attempt.
and
the
judge
that
filed
this
offense,
the
jury
can
fix
the
punishment
with
some
five
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
define
the
same
offense
and
when
it
choose
to
do
it
in
that
statute,
define
the
same
offense
instead
of
simply
using
the
common
method
of
giving
the
jury
the
right
to
fix
the
punishment
with
its
ranges
said
they
can
fix
either
one
that
they
do
it
by
finding
him
guilty
of
the
ones
that
was
the
greater
or
the
lesser,
could
they
do
that?
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
much
has
been
done
yet,
but
it's
after
me
like
you
are
arguing
rather
on
that
basis.
and
then
you
will
say,
in
addition,
that
since
it
has
done
that
and
by
their
mere
choice
of
which
you,
one
day,
find
him
guilty
of,
in
determining
whether
he
should
have
five
years
or
one,
are
you
saying
that
we
should
construe
the
act
and
give
him
authority
only
to
prosecute
for
the
small
ones?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
government
taking
the
position
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
can
choose
between
the
two
where
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
merely
by
saying
we
charge
him
under
this
one
instead
of
the
other
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
were
the
facts
are
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
when
the
facts
are
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
what
you're
arguing
basically
is
that,
here,
the
facts
would
--
identical.
justice
hugo
l.
black
insofar
as
the
act
of
(inaudible)
concerned,
there
could
be
charge
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
you
are
saying
that
giving
criminal
statutes
a
very
strict
and
narrow
construction,
the
government
shouldn't
be
given
the
power
to
prosecute
for
a
greater
offense
rather
than
the
small
ones.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
agree
--
i
don't
like
to
bother
you
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
do
you
agree
with
me
on
--
on
the
facts
on
this
case,
they
could
be
convicted
on
that
either?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
require
anymore
proof
of
the
judgment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
convict
of
the
one
than
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
--
would
it
be
that
fair
if
the
--
if
it
--
if
both
statutes
applied,
if
both
statutes
applied
in
fact
that
are
identical,
why
would
it
be
placed
as
facts
to
the
jury
by
guilt
as
concerned?it
might
be
a
question
of
gradation
of
which
it
extends
punishment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
have
--
and
they
submitted
as
to
both
as
to
this
one
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
ordinarily
true
but
i
assume
it
could
that
the
--
the
law
has
provided
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
had
the
right
to
determine
under
a
different
challenge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

difference
between
in
this
case
from
this
one,
i
think
may
be
the
answer
--
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
it
as
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
at
140
--
section
145
had
said
that
it
should
be
a
felony
punishable
by
10
years
in
penitentiary,
steals
$20
from
a
store.
suppose,
it
said
in
145
(a)
it
should
be
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
six
months
fine
--
in
--
in
a
jail
to
steal
$20
from
a
store,
which
law
would
govern
and
what's
the
difference
in
that
--
this.
i
mentioned
the
odds
of
the
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact
with
the
facts
that
i'm
giving
you
one
on
a
different
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
procedure
of
--
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
two
laws
like
that
assuming
that
they've
raised
whatever
is
to
be
raised
in
the
proper
manner?
can
--
if
it's
your
idea
that
congress
should
make
crimes
of
that
kind
and
have
one
a
felony
and
one
a
misdemeanor
but
they
are
precisely
the
same
thing,
just
one
section
following
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
here,
isn't
it?
it
could
be
the
one
in
jeopardy
that's
under
these
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
has
there
been
any
standard
given
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
made
the
choice?
it
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
either.
somebody
has
to
make
a
choice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
--
even
though
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
when
you
have,
you
have
in
effect
--
i'm
not
talking
about
actually,
you
have
in
effect
two
statutes,
both
of
which
provides
punishment,
define
a
particular
crime
and
this
instance
is
precisely
the
same
way,
as
i
understand
it,
covered
precisely
the
same
facts,
it
makes
one
a
felony
and
one
a
misdemeanor.
and
whatever
they've
raised,
i
--
i
think
they've
raised
something
so
that
that
they
could
be
considered
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
concerned,
they've
raised
the
question
as
to
whether,
i
would
suppose,
at
least,
whether
it
should
be
held
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
prosecuting
officer
or
the
judge
or
anybody
else
can
just
pick
one
of
them
out
and
they
were
given
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
--
that
i
--
but
i
just
want
to
find
that
out
from
you.
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
gilliland
case
precisely
like
that
and
that
there,
congress
had
two
separate
acts
which
were
made
precisely
at
the
same
conduct
and
offense
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
about
"could
have,"
but
at
the
same
language
or
was
a
different
statutes
in
different
language
and
if
--
if
not,
they
were
the
same.
were
the
acts
here
the
same
that
could
have
been
punished
under
the
other?
