mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
if
the
court
please.
this
case
involves
the
review
of
a
conviction
for
income
tax
evasion.
on
may
28th,
1954,
the
petitioner
was
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
on
three
counts
of
willfully
attempting
to
evade
his
income
taxes
for
the
years
1951,
1952,
and
1953
by
filing
false
and
fraudulent
returns,
understating
the
taxes
due
and
owing
to
the
united
states.
there
was
endorsed
on
the
indictment,
section
145
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
as
the
statute
violated
by
petitioner.
this
statute
provides
that
any
person
who
willfully
attempts,
in
any
manner,
to
evade
or
defeat
his
taxes,
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony,
and
upon
conviction
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000
on
prison
for
not
more
than
five
years
or
both.
after
a
jury
trial,
petitioner
was
found
guilty
as
charged
on
all
counts.
on
october
28th,
1954,
the
district
court
entered
its
judgement
of
conviction
on
each
count
and
sentenced
petitioner
to
four
years
imprisonment
on
each
count,
the
terms
to
run
concurrently.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
these
convictions
on
all
counts.
the
evidence
summarized
show
that
the
alleged
unreported
income
consisted
entirely
of
funds
misappropriated
from
petitioner's
employer,
the
st.
louis
labor
health
institute,
which
is
a
medical
center
providing
medical
care
and
dental
care
to
services
--
to
members
of
teamsters'
local
688
in
st.
louis,
missouri,
and
which
institute
is
supported
by
financial
contributions
from
employers
who
have
in
effect
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
teamsters
local
688
in
the
greater
st.
louis
area.
petitioner
was
a
business
manager
of
the
institute.he
authorized
expenditures.he
signed
and
he
drew
checks
on
the
institute's
bank
account.
the
unreported
income,
alleged
and
accepted
by
the
jury
as
true,
came
from
the
amounts
which
he
paid
out
of
the
institute's
funds,
amounts
which
he
paid
through
a
certain
subcontractor
for
work
and
labor
which
petitioner
knew
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
never
been
done,
and
which
amounts
on
receipt
by
the
subcontractor
were
turned
back
by
the
subcontractor
to
the
petitioner.
he
also
paid
out
institute
funds
and
the
other
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
unreported
income
was
funds
that
he
had
paid
out
to
another
subcontractor
for
painting
and
the
building
of
a
ratskeller
in
his
personal
residence,
that
is
the
signing
of
checks
and
the
paying
out
of
his
employer's
funds
by
work
done
purely
at
his
personal
residence.
the
amount
of
taxes
evaded
was
$757
in
1951,
$458
in
1952,
and
$209
in
1953.on
each
of
the
three
tax
evasion
counts,
the
trial
court
refused
to
give
an
instruction,
requested
by
petitioner,
which
would
have
told
the
jury
that
it
could
find
petitioner
guilty
of
a
lesser
crime
based
upon
section
3616
(a)
of
the
revenue
code
of
1939
and
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
section
3616
(a)
provides
that
any
person
who
delivers
or
discloses
to
a
collector
any
false
or
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
the
assessment
intended
to
be
made
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor,
and
shall
be
subject
to
a
$1000
fine
or
one
year
imprisonment
or
both.
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
the
defendant
may
be
found
guilty
of
an
offense
necessarily
included
in
the
offense
charged.
specifically,
this
requested
instruction
would
have
told
the
jury
to
find
the
petitioner
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
under
section
3616
(a)
if
it
believed
that
he,
the
petitioner,
the
defendant
had
delivered
a
false
income
tax
return
to
the
collector
with
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
the
assessment
of
his
tax.
the
court
of
appeals
rule
adversely
to
the
petitioner
on
--
on
this
issue
relying
on
its
earlier
case
of
dillon
versus
the
united
states.
the
rationale
of
the
dillon
case
is
that
no
lesser
instruction
was
required
because
section
3616
(a)
is
inapplicable
to
income
tax
violations.
this
review
here
this
afternoon
is
limited
to
the
single
question,
whether
if
the
trial
court
should
have
instructed
the
jury,
the
petitioner,
who
had
been
indicted
for
the
felony
of
attempted
evasion
of
income
taxes,
that
is
according
to
the
statute
endorsed
on
the
indictment,
could
be
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
of
filing
a
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
defeat
the
assessment.
now,
at
the
outset,
i
think
that
it
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
i
state
certain
very
elementary
and
certain
basic
propositions
with
which
the
petitioner
and
the
government
are
in
full
and
complete
accord.
first,
both
are
agreed
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
was
wrong
in
holding
section
3616
(a)
inapplicable
to
income
tax
violations,
its
legislative
history,
its
collocation
in
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
the
tacit
acceptance
by
various
lower
federal
courts
of
the
applicability
of
3616
to
income
tax
violations
and
the
government's
own
use
of
it
to
punish
certain
what
it
deems
in
"minor
income
tax
violations"
has
led
the
government
to
this
concession.
secondly,
both
are
agreed
that
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
charging
offense
under
section
3616
(a)
as
well
as
under
section
145
(b),
the
indictment
charges
a
willful
attempt
to
evade
income
taxes
by
filing
fraudulent
returns.
it
is
agreed
that
both
statutes
punished
exactly
the
same
act
and
both
punished
such
a
willful
attempt.
thirdly,
it
is
agreed
that
the
government's
proof
would
support
a
conviction
under
section
3616
(a),
as
well
as
under
section
145
(b).
and
lastly,
the
petitioner
and
the
government
are
in
perfect
agreement
that
each
offense
charged
here,
the
felony
and
the
misdemeanor,
does
not,
and
i
emphasize
that
again,
does
not
require
the
proof
of
a
fact
not
essential
to
the
other.
and
that
under
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
pereira
versus
united
states,
double
jeopardy
attaches
here
so
that
the
government
cannot
prosecute
and
could
not
have
prosecuted
this
petitioner
for
both
offenses,
that
is
the
felony
and
the
misdemeanor.
now
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
applicable
section
of
this
145
(b)
as
in
any
person
who
willfully
attempts
in
any
manner
to
defeat
or
evade
his
income
taxes
shall
be
guilty.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
and
any
person
who
willfully
attempts
in
any
manner
to
evade
or
defeat
any
tax
imposed
by
--
imposed
by
this
chapter.
and
it
is
under
this
alternate
section
of
145
(b)
that
it
has
been
agreed
that
this
indictment
was
returned.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
well,
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
i
believe
not.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
i
believe
not.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
no.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
the
government
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
yes.
the
government
and
petitioner
had
an
agreement
on
that.
now,
in
view
of
these
basic
agreements,
you
might
wonder
where
the
area
of
dispute
begins.
the
area
of
dispute
begins
with
the
government's
seeking
to
confine
the
application
of
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
--
of
criminal
procedure
to
the
single
situation
that
a
lesser
offense
instruction
is
entitled,
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
lesser
offense
instruction
only
where
there
exist
a
gradation
of
offenses.
that
is
a
situation
in
which
the
greater
offense
alleged
contains
--
contains
the
same
elements
as
a
lesser
offense
plus
some
aggravating
ingredient
not
found
in
the
lesser
included
offense.
so
that
if
there
is
a
failure
of
proof
in
connection
with
this
aggravating
ingredient,
and
the
jury
is
not
satisfied
of
it,
then
and
then
only
should
the
court
instruct
the
jury
and
may
the
jury
return
a
verdict
finding
the
defendant
guilty
of
a
lesser
offense.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
our
proposition
is,
your
honor,
that
that
doesn't
tell
us
the
whole
story,
that
we
go
further,
that
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
rule
including
lesser
concluded
offenses
which
on
reasoning
and
authority
is
simply
this.
that
--
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
government's
statement
of
the
gradation
theory
as
i
call
as
far
as
it
goes.
we
accept
that
propostion.
we
object
to
its
confinement
to
the
single
gradation
situation.
we
say
that
you
go
on
in
the
cases
whose
reasoning
is
supported
that
where
the
indictment,
by
its
terms
charges
a
major
offense,
and
even
though
a
lesser
offense
is
not
included
in
that
major
offense
as
a
constituent
part
thereof
where
the
indictment
by
its
terms
charges
a
lesser
offense,
then
the
defendant
is
also
entitled
to
a
lesser
offense
instruction.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
in
the
sense,
your
honor
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
no,
all
right.
in
the
sense,
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor
in
a
sense,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
subjected
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
and
a
$10,000
fine
on
the
one
hand
and
being
subjected
to
one
year
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
that's
correct.
then
i
would
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
no,
no.
the
position
that
i
take
here
and
the
position
taken
in
the
brief
that
the
government
doesn't
have
the
election,
that
the
judge
doesn't
have
the
election
to
determine.
then
in
order
to
avoid
certain
problems,
which
were
raised
by
the
government's
position,
that
the
court
can
only
sentence
under
the
misdeamenor
section.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
that
if
the
jury
finds
that
the
facts
in
alleging
the
indictment
that
the
defendant
has
filed
a
false
return
with
the
intent
to
defeat
his
assessment
that
the
jury
shall
return
a
conviction
under
section
3616.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
well,
it
is
our
position
here,
your
honor,
that
the
court
had
no
alternative
but
to
sentence
under
a
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
there
would
be
no
facts
that
would
be
different.
there
would
be
absolutely
no
facts
that
would
be
different.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
however,
i
don't
think
that
even
accepting
that
position
which
we
quite
willingly
accepted
in
the
brief,
supports
the
government's
position
that
it
had
a
choice,
an
election
to
prosecute
under
145
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
trial
judge
had
the
right
to
sentence
under
a
felony.
the
reason
that
we
take
the
position
is
very
simple.
how
can
you
say,
if
there
is
no
rational
basis,
as
your
honor
seems
to
believe,
there
is
no
instruction
that
can
be
framed
to
tell
the
difference,
and
--
and
we'll
accept
it?how
can
you
say
if
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
the
judge
to
have
instructed
the
jury
than
what
rational
basis
would
you
by
the
grand
jury
in
indicting?
what
rational
basis
was
used
by
the
government
in
deciding
to
proceed
under
145
(b)?
then
aren't
you
put
in
this
position
that
you
are
saying,
"well,
we'll
give
the
government
its
election"?
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor,
unless
you
set
up
some
ascertainable
standard
which
is
our
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
not
unless
there's
some
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
for
one
single
offense?
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
yes,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
that
will
be
perfectly
all
right.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
well,
that
is
correct.
we
take
the
position
here
that
the
act
should
and
be
construed
as
giving
to
the
trial
judge
the
power
only
to
sentence
for
the
lesser
offense.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
oh,
yes,
the
government
says
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
yes
and
the
government
tells
us
in
footnote
9
in
its
brief,
page
13,
that
while
it
is
traditionally
used
3616
(a)
and
its
--
its
footnote
9,
page
23,
“we
have
traditionally
used
these
two
statutes
in
order
to
make
a
choice.”
and
that
what
we
have
done
is
that
even
though
we
recognized
it
under
3616,
there
may
be
technically
enough
evidence
to
indict
for
felony,
that
there
are
certain
cases
of
such
minor
importance.
we
don't
know
what
minor
is
that's
why
i
say
that's
a
word
in
quotation
marks
to
justify
the
choice
of
a
misdeamenor
rather
than
the
felony,
then
the
government
goes
on
to
tell
us
its
a
typical
example
of
when
we
use
3616.
we
use
in
the
case
of
a
felon
who's
cheated
on
his
taxes,
who's
taken
too
many
dependents
as
false
dependents,
and
that
is
a
typical
case
that
will
--
that
we
use
to
that
extent.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
there
may
be
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
that
is
correct.
there
may
be
certain
situations
which
is
not
this
case
underwhich
the
3616
and
145
(b)
would
be
different,
145
(b),
the
double
jeopardy,
the
selection
that
the
government
urges
that
it
has
the
right
to
make.
there
may
be
certain
situations
in
which
the
government
will
have
a
perfect
right
to
make
the
selection.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
your
honor?
what's
that?
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
well,
that
is
correct.
perhaps
in
the
situation
where
under
3616,
no
return
at
all
is
filed.
now,
that
could
not
be
in
most
situations,
a
violation
of
3616
because
3616
requires
an
affirmative
deliverance
of
disclosing
to
a
collector.
now,
there
have
been
at
least
two
cases
decided
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
where
no
returns
have
been
filed
but
there
have
been
other
acts
of
concealment
which
have
constituted
a
violation
of
145.
so,
it's
possible
in
that
very
narrow
area
that
they
do
not
overlap.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
and
were
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
that
is
correct.
that
is
substantially
our
position
and
that
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
of
what
facts
the
jury
found
that
this
defendant
can
only
be
sentenced
under
what
i
have
called,
perhaps
mistakenly,
a
lesser
offense.
that
is
an
offense
in
which
the
penalty
is
lesser
and
not
in
--
and
not
an
offense
that
i
can
say
as
murder
is
to
manslaughter
or
larceny
is
to
robbery,
that
there
are
constituent
elements
that
we
can
go
down
and
checko
off
a,
b,
c,
d
and
then
say,
“well,
here's
an
aggravating
element
to
this
in
present,
and
therefore,
in
this
respect,
it's
a
lesser
included
offense.”
the
basis
is
that
this
is
a
lesser
included
offense
which
was
independently
charged
and
become
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
yes.
yes,
we
have,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
yes,
we
have.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
i
believe
that
you
will
find
a
suggestion
to
that
effect,
your
honor,
in
the
brief.
and
the
government
accuses
us
of
it
and
we
agree
we're
guilty
of
it
that
we
say
in
effect,
“yes,
that
you
can't
sentence
any
more
than
under
3616.”
the
government
says,
"well,
you're
trying
to
appeal
by
implication
section
145
(b),
the
assumption
being
that
that's
bad."
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
no,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
served
eight
months
at
the
united
states
penitentiary
in
terre
haute.
and
when
certiorari
was
granted
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
dillon,
which
presented
this
very
same
issue,
a
motion
for
bail
was
presented
to
mr.
justice
clark.
it
was
not
opposed
by
the
government.
the
question
was
conceivably
susbstantial
and
he's
been
out
of
terre
haute
for
about
the
last
year.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
only
eight
months.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
yes,
but
if
the
question
is
a
matter
of
resentencing,
and
--
and
we
can
see
that
under
the
government's
theory
in
a
position
we
would
agree
with,
that
perhaps
the
question
here
is
one
of
resentencing,
that
he's
not
entitled
to
a
new
trial
because
there
would
be
nothing
that
the
jury
could
find
different
than
it's
found
the
first
time.
so,
maybe
the
question
is
we
send
him
back
to
resentencing
under
the,
what
i
call
the
lesser
offense
and
the
trial
judge,
the
--
the
misdemeanor
and
the
trial
judge
would
sentence
him
in
accordance
with
that.
that
is
true,
if
the
court
accepts
the
government's
hypothesis
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
two
statutes,
and
that
they
both
require
exactly
the
same
proof.
now,
as
the
court
will
see
in
our
main
brief,
i
have
made
the
suggestion
that
it
is
most
difficult,
and
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
go
on
except
a
--
an
analogy
between
murder
and
manslaughter
that
perhaps
if
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two,
perhaps
there
is
a
difference
and
maybe
the
difference
is
in
the
different
required
quantum
of
intent.
but
as
i
say,
there
is
nothing
in
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
it
was
merely
an
attempt
to
perhaps
find
some
way
of
accommodating
these
two
statutes.
but
if
the
government's
position
is
correct
that
they
cover
exactly
the
same
things,
that
wouldn't
be
true
at
all,
and
the
question
here
is
primarily
one
of
what
prejudice
was
there
to
the
defendant?
the
only
prejudice
is
that
perhaps
he
could
have
been
--
perhaps
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense
and
perhaps
he
should
have
been
sentenced
under
what
i
call
a
lesser
offense,
so
we'll
send
him
back
for
resentencing
and
there's
no
need
for
a
retrial.
and
that
is
certainly
a
position
which
could
be
taken,
if
under
the
government's
position.
i
think
it's
--
it's
the
logical
result
of
the
government's
position.
it
had
to.
i
asked
the
court
to
--
to
tolerate
us,
at
least
in
this
respect,
that
we
didn't
know
what
concessions
the
government
were
--
was
going
to
make.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
been
long
my
personal
opinion
that
we
would
never
be
here
if
the
solicitor
general
hadn't
confessed
that
the
eighth
circuit
was
wrong
in
its
rationale
with
the
dillon
case,
and
the
government
is
concerned.
what
the
government
wants,
they
want
this
happy
little
situation
where
they
can
prosecute
a,
under
a
misdemeanor,
he's
not
such
a
bad
fellow,
he
only
took
six
extra
dependents.
he's
bad,
he
should
be
prosecuted
but
under
a
felony,
but
people
who
steal
from
their
employers,
labor
leaders,
they're
very
bad
and
they
ought
to
be
prosecuted
for
felonies.
and
the
only
thing
that
the
government
tells
us
in
this
brief
and
--
and
the
only
safeguard,
and
the
only
ascertainable
standard
that
they
suggest
on
footnote
14
at
page
30
is
the
supervision
of
the
justice
department
in
a
high
degree
of
discretion
to
be
be
rendered
by
the
united
states
attorney
by
the
grand
jury.
to
--
to
me,
that
doesn't
seem
satisfactory,
and
that
is
our
basic
objection.
and
that
is
the
position
that
we
take
when
we
say
that
there
is
no
ascertainable
standard
which
the
government
suggest.
there
is
nothing,
except
this
business
of
a
minor
offense,
an
offense
of
minor
importance.
what
is
an
offense
of
minor,
is
it
money,
$1500
over
a
three-year
period?
i
don't
think
anyone
would
say
that's
a
big
tax
case,
tax
evasion
case.
is
it
the
percentage
of
income
which
has
been
evaded?
is
that
the
test?
well,
in
these
cases,
50%
one
year,
40%
another,
and
about
22%
another,
pretty
big
percentages.
but
where
do
we
go
and
how
is
the
government
exercising
this
discretion?
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
i
don't
agree
with
that,
and
i
don't
agree
with
it
--
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
all
right.
but
--
but
what
i
would
say
to
you
that
at
least
he
has
different
statutes
which
require
different
proof.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
but
the
statute
itself
tells
a
district
attorney
what
the
difference
in
proof
is,
what
the
standard
is
and
that
we
don't
have
here.
that's
the
point
that
i
make.
yes,
let
him
choose
between
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor,
as
long
as
the
statute
itself
says,
“well,
there's
a
different
proof,”
and
you're
not
immunizing
the
defendant
from
later
prosecution
for
the
felony
under
the
pereira
case
under
double
jeopardy
by
saying,
"well,
we'll
go
after
him
on
a
misdemeanor,"
because
that's
exactly
what
happens
here.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
well,
i
think
your
honor,
that
stems
from
a
basic
disagreement.
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
stanley
m.
rosenblum
well,
let's
look
at
a
case
in
which
the
government
relies.
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
--
a
recent
case,
it's
an
old
case,
but
i
think
it
illustrates
what
at
least
i
mean
by
a
lesser
included
offense.
i
think
you'll
find
the
case,
it's
--
it's
an
old
case,
united
states
versus
dickson,
page
18
of
the
government's
brief.
the
government
tells
us
that
here
is
a
familiar
illustration
of
what
we
mean
by
a
"lesser
included
offense."
when
an
indictment
for
burglary
supports
a
conviction
for
larceny
but
the
jury
isn't
satisfied
as
to
the
breaking
and
entering
during
the
nighttime,
so
the
government
tells
us,
"well,
it's
all
right
in
that
case
to
return
the
conviction
for
larceny."
now,
if
you
read
that
case
carefully,
as
i
read
it,
at
that
time,
burglary
carried
the
death
penalty.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
judge
call
this
defendant
back
several
times.
he
said,
"do
you
know
what
you're
doing?
you're
pleading
guilty
to
something
that
you
could
be
sentenced
to
death
warrant."
finally,
he
withdrew
his
plea
of
guilty
and
he
went
to
trial
on
a
burglary.
now,
i
ask
you.
can
element
for
element,
is
larceny
a
constituent
offense
under
burglary?
i
submit
that
it
is
not.
that
burglary
requires
the
breaking
and
entering
the
dwelling
house
to
another
at
night
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony
therein.
it
doesn't
require
any
taking
and
carrying
away
of
the
personal
property
of
another,
and
i
submit
that
it
was
not.
that
if
you
accept
the
government's
own
interpretation,
that
their
reliance
on
this
case
is
misplaced,
but,
i
think
that
the
dickson
case,
and
i
say
it's
only
an
old
case,
1807
circuit
court.
the
only
way
that
that
case
will
be
explained
is
that
the
indictment
charged
the
larceny
with
taking
and
carrying
away
in
--
as
a
lesser
offense
as
something
within
the
indictment,
less
than
the
burglary,
that
the
jury
wasn't
satisfied.
and
the
only
way
that
that
page
can
be
explained
is
that
the
larceny
carried
with
it
a
penalty
of
39
stripes,
with
the
whip,
as
contrast
with
the
death
sentence.
and
in
this
sense,
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense
because
it
was
charged
with
an
indictment,
and
that
is
our
basic
quarrel
with
a
gradation
theory
as
--
as
put
forth
here
by
the
government.
it
was
a
--
logically,
there's
no
reasoning,
there's
no
authority
for
it,
that
if
you're
not
going
to
be
bound
by
the
statute
number,
if
the
prosecution
can
convict
under
any
statute,
then
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
rely
on
any
statute
which
the
indictment
charges
and
which
the
allegation
support,
especially
if
it's
a
lesser
offense
and
we
say
that
this
is
not
only
fair
to
the
defendant,
but
it's
just
as
fair
to
the
prosecution.
why
should
the
defendant
be
acquitted?
simply
because
element
for
element,
every
allegation
in
the
indictment
isn't
proved.
if
failing
one
allegation,
the
defendant
has
been
advised
of
the
allegations.
the
defendant
has
had
ample
opportunity
to
defend.
why
should
he
be
acquitted
and
then
tried
anew
on
a
lesser
charge
of
offense?
he
should
be
prepared
and
he's
been
given
ample
notice
to
defend
against
every
allegation
in
the
indictment,
and
we
submit
that
in
that
sense,
this
petitioner
was
prejudiced
because
he
--
there
was
not
given
a
lesser
included
offense
and
he
was
prejudiced
because
he
was
not
sentenced
for
a
lesser
included
offense,
the
only
offense
which
he
could
properly
be
sentenced
on
under
--
under
the
government's
theory,
under
the
concessions
and
on
the
agreements
into
which
we
willingly
entered.
