mr.
philip
elman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
state
at
the
outset
that
neither
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
nor
in
this
court,
has
the
petitioner
challenged
the
legality
of
the
sentence
that
was
imposed.
the
sole
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
as
to
which
the
court
granted
review,
is
whether
the
trial
court
erred
in
refusing
to
give
the
requested
lesser
offense
instruction.
mr.
philip
elman
i
mean,
i
should
be
very
happy
to
argue
the
point,
sir,
if
the
court
considers
it
open.
mr.
philip
elman
we
argued,
sir
that
the
petitioner's
contention
as
to
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
if
accepted,
would
in
effect
repeal
section
145
(b)
as
applied
to
the
filing
of
false
and
fraudulent
returns.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
considers
the
legality
of
the
sentence
issue
open.
if
the
court
does
consider
it
open,
i'm
prepared
to
argue
it.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir,
i'd
be
very
happy.
the
function
of
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
petitioner's
position
and
ours
is
that
section
145
and
section
3616
(a),
both
appearing
in
the
same
statute
1939
code,
are
both
valid.
they
both
can
stand
side
by
side
neither
impliedly
repeals
or
modifies
the
other.
now,
this
case
--
mr.
philip
elman
i'm
fine.
i'm
very
happy
with
that.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
i
would
certainly
agree
to
that.
this
is
a
case
where
the
indictment
was
--
was
valid
under
either
statute
and
it
might
be
held
that
the
outset
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
if
there
--
if
there
had
been
no
citation
of
a
statute
in
the
indictment,
if
the
citation
had
been
omitted,
notwithstanding
the
requirement
of
rule
7c
that
it'd
be
specified.
but
if
there
had
been
no
statutory
citation
in
the
indictment,
it
would
be
clear
or
at
least,
petitioner
and
the
government
agreed
that
it
would
be
clear
that
the
indictment
set
forth
a
violation,
not
only
under
3616
(a)
but
also
under
145
(b).
we
also
agree
that
the
proof
in
this
case
would
support
conviction
under
either
statute.
and
in
essence,
even
though
the
issue
as
tendered
to
the
court
has
been
cast
in
terms
of
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction
in
view
of
the
general
direction,
the
argument
has
taken,
i
think
it
had
--
what
we've
--
we've
really
discovered
that
the
--
the
disagreement
here
is
a
somewhat
at
different
proposition.
this
agreement
is
--
as
to
what
should
be
done
in
the
case
of
overlapping
criminal
statutes,
in
the
case
of
two
statutes
which
are
not
identical,
two
statutes
which
are
not
co-extensive,
but
which
to
a
substantial
extent
overlap.
now,
in
most
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
in
involving
overlapping
statutes,
the
--
the
court
has
been
confronted
with
an
argument
that
a
later
statute
dealing
with
a
more
specific
subject
matter,
carrying
a
lesser
penalty
has
repealed
or
superceded
an
earlier
statute
which
is
more
general,
which
carries
a
more
severe
penalty.
that
was
the
situation
in
the
gilliland
case
and
in
the
novak
case,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
overlapping
provisions
in
the
federal
common
law
--
in
the
federal
criminal
law
are
a
common
place
that
the
penal
provisions
in
the
united
states
code
are
not
like
a
mosaic
or
a
jigsaw
puzzle
in
which
every
piece
neatly
interlocks
which
there
are
no
gaps
and
no
overlaps.
that
isn't
the
basis
on
which
legislation
is
enacted.
congress
enacts
legislation
to
meet
a
particular
need.
and
in
the
field
of
frauds
upon
the
united
states
in
the
field
of
making
a
false
statements
to
--
to
representatives,
agencies
of
the
united
states,
congress
has
been
especially,
or
shall
i
say,
zealous,
to
prevent
any
loopholes
in
its
legislation.
and
the
result
is
that
congress
has
not
only
acted
abundantly,
it's
acted
redundantly.
and
the
--
and
here
we
have
the
same
statute,
1939
revenue
code,
which
in
one
section,
145
(b)
makes
it
a
felony
to
attempt
willfully,
to
evade
taxes,
income
taxes,
only
i
should
say,
i
should
mention
and
i
stress
it
because
145
(b)
doesn't
apply
to
any
other
kind
of
federal
taxes.
145
(b)
says
that
as
to
income
taxes,
evasion
in
any
form
is
a
felony,
and
that
99%
of
the
cases
that
have
arisen
under
145
(b),
the
evasion
has
taken
the
form
of
filing
a
false
and
fraudulent
return.
in
3616
(a)
of
the
same
statute,
congress
has
said
that
the
filing
was
a
delivery
of
any
tax
return,
not
merely
income
tax
returns,
but
all
tax
returns
shall
be
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
philip
elman
it
says
--
well,
it
says
any
return.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
this
statute,
3616
(a)
goes
back
to
the
revenue
act
of
1798
that's
been
reenacted
time
and
again
--
mr.
philip
elman
customs,
excised
taxes,
floor
stock
taxes.
now,
this
--
these
--
both
these
statutes
have
a
history.
that
the
revenue
act
of
1917,
for
the
first
time,
included
a
prohibition
of
income
tax
evasion;
145
(b)
goes
back
to
1917,
3616
(a)
goes
back
to
1798,
and
both
have
emerged
in
a
full
fruition
in
the
1939
code
and
there
they
are,
they
--
they
are
side
by
side.
if
there
is
an
overlap,
that
the
overlap
does
not
arise
by
any
act
of
the
attorney
general,
it
arises
by
act
of
congress.
and
the
court
in
a
--
in
cases
which
are
so
familiar
that
it's
unnecessary
to
cite
them
here,
has
sent
and
repeals
by
implication
are
not
favored.
the
mere
fact
that
two
laws
covered
the
same
ground
does
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
there's
--
a
supersession
was
intended.
if
there
is
a
repeal,
it
--
intent
of
congress
to
repeal
must
be
clear
and
manifest
that
there
must
be
a
positive
repugnancy
between
the
old
provisions
and
the
new
provisions.
now,
here,
all
we
have
is
a
redundancy,
not
between
old
and
new
provisions
but
in
the
same
statute.
and
if
there
is
a
repeal
by
implication,
which
statute
is
to
be
repealed?
which
is
the
older
statute?
which
is
the
newer
statute?
which
is
the
general
statute?
which
is
the
more
specific
statute?
3616
(a)
is
comprehensive
as
to
all
returns.
it
goes
beyond
145
(b)
which
is
limited
to
income
tax
evasions
145
(b),
however,
is
more
comprehensive
than
3616
(a)
because
it
covers
all
evasions
even
those
not
involving
the
filing
of
false
return.
now,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two.
the
difference
is
that
one
is
a
felony
and
the
other
is
a
misdemeanor.
now,
as
to
the
income
tax,
there
was
a
very
good
reason
for
congress
to
be
especially
alert
to
impose
a
severe
penalty
because
the
income
tax
law,
as
the
court
had
said
in
several
cases,
is
based
on
a
system
of
voluntary
disclosure
of
self-assessment.
and
that
a
filing
of
a
false
customs
return
might
seem,
to
congress,
to
be
a
--
a
--
an
offense
not
justifying
a
more
severe
penalty
than
the
years
of
imprisonment.
but
what
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
we're
not
arguing,
if
i
may
answer
the
question
this
way.
insofar
as
the
intent
of
congress
is
concerned,
sir,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
know
of.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
intention
of
congress
on
this
must
appear
from
its
provision,
from
what
congress
did.
the
statute
does
punish
income
tax
evasions
in
all
forms,
in
any
manner,
and
as
i
said
before,
if
i
--
if
i
had
to
make
an
arithmetic
estimate,
i
would
say
that
99.5%
at
least
of
the
145
(b)
income
tax
evasion
cases
are
the
filing
of
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
understating
the
tax
due.
now,
if
--
if
congress,
by
going
beyond
145
(b)
in
reenacting
the
substance
of
3616
(a),
has
withdrawn
from
145
(b),
what
is
the
most
flagrant,
the
most
obvious
form
of
income
tax
evasion
and
they
died
a
misdemeanor?
it
would
seem
--
it
would
seem
--
and
i
must
add
too
that
the
145
(b)
was
made
a
felony
in
--
the
revenue
act
of
1924,
32
years
ago.
and
3616
(a)
and
145
(b)
have
--
have
stood
side
by
side
over
the
years
and
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
suggestion
has
been
made
and
it
--
and
it
--
and
i
say,
it
comes
in
rather
obliquely
because
it
--
certainly,
this
was
not
--
not
been
contended
explicitly
before
this
--
this
afternoon
that
3616
(a)
has
cut
into
the
prohibitions
of
145
(b).
and
it's
--
it's
difficult
for
--
it
would
seem
to
us
that
if
--
if
the
court
should
now
hold
that
because
of
the
duplication
coverage
of
the
two
provisions
that
a
taxpayer
who
files
a
false
and
fraudulent
income
tax
return
with
an
intent
--
the
intent
to
evade
the
tax
can
be
given
only
the
maximum
sentence
provided
by
3616
(a).
it
would
seem
to
us
that
what
it
comes
down
to
is
--
is
carving
out
of
145
(b)
the
very
heart
of
the
--
of
the
provision
as
it's
been
applied
by
the
courts,
including
this
court,
over
the
years.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir,
145
(b)
covers
a
failure
to
pay
over
any
tax.
mr.
philip
elman
failure
to
collect
the
truth
for
the
account,
go
and
pay
over
the
tax
and
any
person
who
willfully
attempt,
in
any
manner
to
evade
or
defeat
any
tax
imposed
by
this
chapter.
and
it's
under
the
latter
provision
that
the
overwhelming
bulk
of
violations
of
145
(b)
occurs
in
a
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
not
only
--
mr.
philip
elman
not
only
--
mr.
philip
elman
not
only
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
person
who
willfully
files
false
income
tax
return
not
only
violates
145
(b),
3616
(a),
but
he
probably
also
violates
the
general
false
statement
statute,
18
u.s.c.
1001.
if
--
if
there's
a
claim
for
refund
involved,
he
may
violate
the
false
claim
statute,
18
u.s.c.
287.
and
he
may
prove
permits,
he
--
he
may
be
found
to
violate
30809
(a),
i
believe
it
is,
of
the
--
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
makes
it
a
felony
to
willfully
subscribe
to
any
tax
return,
not
believing
into
the
--
completely
true
in
every
particular.
and
we
--
we
don't
deny
that
--
that
congress
has
--
has
really
enacted
provisions
which
--
which
duplicate
one
another
and
which
perhaps
might
be
--
be
unnecessary
that's
been
in
an
over
and
abundance
of
--
of
care
on
the
part
of
congress
to
--
to
see
to
it
that
no
one
escapes
the
net.
now,
the
--
the
problem
hasn't
arisen
before
because
these
other
provisions
don't
carry
a
lesser
punishment
than
145
(b).
now,
this
case,
this
case
in
the
dillon
case,
for
the
first
time
presented
a
--
a
situation
where
a
defendant
requested
the
jury
to
decide
which
of
these
two
statutes
was
violated.
and
as
--
has
been
brought
out
here,
it's
not
the
--
the
jury
is
essentially
a
fact-finding
body.
it's
not
the
function
of
a
jury
to
decide
the
question
which
of
the
two
--
of
two
or
more
statutes
have
been
violated.
now,
if
the
judge
in
this
case
had
considered
that
the
circumstances
and
the
gravity
of
the
offense
were
suce
that
a
--
a
lesser
punishment
should
be
imposed,
there
was
no
reason
why
he
couldn't
impose
a
sentence
of
one
day
or
one
year,
or
not
at
all.the
question
of
punishment
is
not
for
the
jury.
now,
that
was
the
error
asserted
below.
that
was
the
error
passed
down
below.
that
was
the
question
presented
here,
and
on
that
question,
we
think
there
can
be
only
one
answer
that
the
requested
instruction,
had
it
been
given,
would
have
required
the
jury
to
exercise
a
judgement.
it
would
have
given
the
jury
no
basis
or
standard
upon
which
the
jury
could
intelligently
and
rationally
exercise
a
judgement,
and
it
would
have
been
a
judgement
not
as
to
a
question
of
fact
within
the
traditional
prerogative
of
the
jury
but
it
would
be
on
the
question
of
law,
a
question
of
which
of
two
statutes
enacted
by
congress
applies
here.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
philip
elman
but
--
but
the
petitioner
did
not
--
did
not
ask
anything
more
than
that
the
jury
be
allowed
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilt
which
would
--
which
would
say,
“guilty
under
3616
(a)
and
not
145(b).”
now,
the
jury,
never
in
its
verdict,
says,
specify
as
a
statute
which
is
violated.
all
the
jury
says
he's
guilty
as
charged,
not
guilty
as
charged,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
on
what
basis
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir,
there
would
be
substantial
difference
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
question
of
which
law
would
govern
might
arise
in
the
--
in
a
variety
of
context.
i'm
not
pretending
to
avoid
the
answer.
if
it
comes
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
the
--
the
question
would
--
would
--
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
which
law
would
govern
--
govern
because
the
indictment
is
valid
under
either.
if
the
question
arises
in
a
--
in
a
--
in
this
context
where
a
requested
instruction
of
the
jury
is
--
is
offered,
we
would
--
we
wouldn't
say
that
it
is
not
the
jury's
function
to
decide
which
law
governs.if
the
question
arises
under
the
sentence
and
the
power
of
sentencing
get
the
authority
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
if
congress
were
to
enact
the
law
saying
that
murder
shall
be
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor
and
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
discretion
of
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
i
think
it
would
be
a
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
so.
mr.
philip
elman
but
i
don't
think
that's
this
case,
because
congress
hasn't
said
--
congress
hasn't
said
the
filing
of
a
false
income
tax
return
shall
be
either
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
philip
elman
under
the
--
under
the
indictment
in
this
case
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
the
facts,
a
conviction
under
either
statute
is
valid.
but
this
is
--
but
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
a
serious
difference
between
a
case
in
which
congress,
which
has
the
power
to
classify
offenses
according
to
felonies
and
misdemeanors
in
effect
delegates
that
power
to
a
prosecutor,
the
jury
without
giving
any
ascertainable
rational
standard,
that's
one
case.
it's
not
this
case.
mr.
philip
elman
there
isn't
any
--
there
isn't
any
standard
given
here,
sir,
because
there's
no
--
there's
--
there's
no
choice
that
was
made
here
by
the
attorney
general.
there
was
no
choice
here.
mr.
philip
elman
no.
the
question,
if
i
may
say
so,
there's
no
question.
the
--
we
don't
rely
on
the
proposition
this
indictment
says
145
(b)
because
if
the
indictment
were
blank
on
that,
we
would
still
say
that
the
trial
court
was
empowered
under
a
--
a
statute
of
the
united
states
making
tax
evasion
an
offense
to
impose
a
four-year
sentence.
mr.
philip
elman
he
doesn't
have
to
have
an
--
an
attorney
general
write
a
citation
of
the
indictment.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
let
me
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice,
this
argument
--
this
argument
is
not
a
new
one.
for
example,
in
the
gilliland
case,
which
came
before
you
in
--
in
312
u.s.,
that
was
an
indictment
under
section
35,
the
old
criminal
code,
the
false
--
the
general
galse
statement
statute
making
it
a
felony
punishable
by
10
years
imprisonment
to
--
to
a
--
make
a
false
statement
to
a
government
agency.
the
indictment
in
that
case
charged
that
the
defendant
had
made
a
false
statement
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
a
matter
under
the
hot
oil
act
of
1935.
the
defendant
came
to
this
court
and
argue
that
under
the
hot
oil
act,
the
--
the
making
of
a
false
statement
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
a
matter
under
that
act
was
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor
by
only
six
months
imprisonment.
and
he
argued
that
congress
and
the
hot
oil
act
of
1935
must
have
intended
that
the
specific
provision
of
that
act
should
govern
false
statements
made
under
it.
and
he
argued
and
the
argument
is
--
is
recorded
in
312
u.s.,
and
prior
to
the
opinion,
the
argument
was
made
by
the
defendant.
this
gives
the
attorney
general
an
election
at
his
discretion
to
punish
an
offender
under
either
the
general
false
statement
statute
of
felony
or
under
the
--
on
the
specific
statute.
and
this
court,
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice
hughes,
unanimously
held
that
--
that
the
two
statutes
can
exist
side
by
side.
they
compliment
one
another
unless
--
unless
that
the
court
has
some
clear
and
specific
indication
from
congress
beyond
the
mere
fact
of
redundancy
that
the
specific
provision
was
intended
to
cut
in
on
the
--
on
the
general
provision.
there's
no
reason
why
the
laws
can't
--
can't
be
enforced
together,
and
that
--
that
–-
mr.
philip
elman
that's
a
fortiori
from
this
case.
mr.
philip
elman
that
was
conceded
in
that
case.
mr.
philip
elman
in
the
--
that
was
stated
in
the
gilliland
case.
that
was
conceded.
the
government
could
have
--
the
indictment
could
have
born
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
language
of
two
statutes
was
not
precisely
identical
but
they
are
closer
to
one
another
than
the
two
statutes
here
because
in
gilliland
case,
you
had
general
false
statement
statute
about
making
false
statements
to
an
--
a
representative
or
agency
of
the
united
states,
and
the
hot
oil
act
said,
“making
a
false
statement
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
on
a
--
on
the
form
provided
for
by
his
regulations,
you
see.
but
if
you
made
a
--
if
you
made
a
misstatement
on
the
return
provided
for
in
the
regulations,
you
violated
not
only
the
specific
provision,
hot
oil
act,
but
the
general
provision
of
false
statement
statute.”
this
--
these
two
statutes
are
not
even
as
close
together
as
though
is
because
3616
(a)
speaks
of
returns
and
145
(b)
does
not.
it
was
--
as
i
said
before,
if
--
if
the
gilliland
case
gave
the
court
no
difficulty,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
where
the
two
conflicting
--
the
two
duplicating
provisions
appear
in
the
same
statute,
it
would
be
the
first
time.
it
seems
that
we
would
know
of
--
of
the
court
holding
the
congress
by
implication
has
repealed
one
provision
of
a
statute
by
another
provision
in
the
same
statute.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
certiorari
was
limited
to
that
issue.
mr.
philip
elman
certiorari
was
--
mr.
philip
elman
216.
mr.
philip
elman
216.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
know
--
mr.
philip
elman
then
it's
requested
instruction
number
12.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
the
answer
is
nothing.
that
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
on
page
--
if
your
honor
is
going
to
the
record,
i
would
suggest
too
that
you
look
at
one
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
will
not
quarrel
with
you
on
that.
at
page
191
of
the
record,
the
trial
court
did
instruct
the
jury
as
to
the
ingredients
of
the
offense
charged
in
the
indictment.
he
--
he
said,
“before
the
defendant
can
be
held
criminally
responsible,
the
government
must
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
the
return
is
false
and
fraudulent,
then
it
knew
the
return
was
false
and
fraudulent,
then
it
would
be
intent
to
evade
taxes
on
this.”
that's
a
--
that's
the
typical
charge
in
a
--
in
a
tax
evasion
case.
there's
no
--
there's
no
challenge.
if
they
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
really
believe
that
if
that
charge
had
been
given,
the
jury
would
have
been
utterly
confused.
the
jury
wouldn't
know
--
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
or
a
--
what
--
on
what
basis
they
should
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty,
145
(b)
or
verdict
of
guilty
3616
(a),
because
as
everyone
agrees,
if
--
if
mr.
berra
did
everything
that
the
indictment
said
he
did,
he's
guilty
under
both
statutes
and
if
--
and
if
the
government
did
not
sustain
its
burden
of
proof
as
to
any
element
of
the
offense
charged,
he's
not
guilty
under
the
false
statute
so
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
on
which
the
jury
could
acquit
as
to
the
offense
charged
and
convict
as
to
3616
(a).
there
was
no
--
there
was
nothing
in
the
evidence
which
would
have
permitted
that
kind
of
--
of
a
verdict
and
--
and
we
--
we
have
addressed
ourselves
on
the
brief,
primarily
to
the
proposition
that
the
requested
instruction
would
have
imposed
upon
the
jury.
it
was
not
within
its
proper
concern.
it
was
then
misleading.
if
afforded,
no
basis
or
standards
upon
which
the
jury
could
return
a
verdict,
and
since
the
question
arose
this
afternoon
as
to
the
legality
of
--
of
the
sentence,
we
think
that
in
effect
is
an
argument
that
145
(b)
can
--
did
not
authorize
the
trial
court
to
impose
the
sentence
which
he
did.
mr.
philip
elman
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
so.
(voice
overlap)
i
--
i
speak
hesitantly
because
–-
mr.
philip
elman
i
speak
hesitantly
because
i
haven't
researched
upon
it
lately.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
believe
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
believe
under
rule
25
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i
think
it's
rule
25
after
the
appeal,
the
judgement
has
affirmed,
the
defendant
on
remand
of
the
case,
the
district
court
can
move
for
a
reduction
or
modification
of
sentence
on
any
grounds.
thank
you
very
much.
