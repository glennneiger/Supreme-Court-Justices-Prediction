justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
if
--
if
the
requested
charge
had
been
given
under
this
indictment,
under
the
fact
that
--
or
in
evidence
in
this
case,
was
there
anything
in
--
could
--
could
an
offense
that
an
offense
have
been
found
under
3616
could
not
have
been
found
under
145?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
was
nothing
to
that
--
still
definitely
is
in
the
argument
--
state
your
argument,
3616
and
something
that
was
carved
out
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
the
matter
which
is
identical
with
145
(b).
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
your
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
answer
my
question
a
minute
ago.you
agreed
that
here
there
was
not
a
difference
of
offenses
between
145
(b)
and
3616,
what
i
tell
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
how,
if
there's
identity
can
be
lesser
or
greater
--
in
any
sense
lesser
and
greater
as
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
lesser
can
have
any
just
come
into
play
when
you
got
identity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
the
identity
or
non-identity
of
new
offenses.
that
has
to
do
without
a
punishment,
should
be
denied
and
i'm
very
sympathetic
with
your
problem,
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
invoke
the
lesser
offense
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only,
your
honor,
if
the
proof
required
is
identical.
only
if
the
proof
is
required
as
the
same.
now,
we
say
that
in
that
situation,
the
government
has
no
election
to
say,
“well,
we'll
prosecute
this
one
for
a
felony
and
that
one
for
a
misdeamenor.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
were
nothing,
suppose
the
indictment
has
no
indication
under
what
statute,
the
thing
is
broad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
would
the
judge
charge
for
the
jury,
you
must
bring
in,
since
the
punishment
consist
to
be
equally
under
3616
and
i
lead
them
to
go
only
a
year
when
under
145
(b),
i
should
give
five
years,
you
must
tell
me
what
i
should
give,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
tell
--
tell
me
what
--
what
instruction
as
the
filing
of
fact
because
jury
finds
fact.
what
instruction
as
the
filing
of
fact
to
be
judged
in
that
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
business
of
a
jury
to
label
an
offense.that's
the
business
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
well
be
--
no,
you
may
well
be
right
as
to
what
sentence
should
be
imposed,
but
i
--
i
like
to
specify
my
question.
what
instruction
under
the
division
of
responsibility
between
jury
and
judge,
that
the
judge
tell
the
jury
as
to
what
they
should
file,
not
what
label
it
should
pick
up
based
on
it
with
the
consequences
of
sentence
but
what
difference,
what
facts
should
be
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
have
nothing
more
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
nothing
to
do
with
the
government.
that's
due
with
the
duty
of
the
judge
in
sentencing.
the
difficulty
of
ours
is
not
from
the
--
from
what
government
have
done
but
what
the
congress
have
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
two
statutes
are
not
always
overlapping.
the
two
statutes
says
may
serve
and
do
serve
different
consequences.
they
also
infer
that
in
this
case
that
--
that
serve
to
be
--
say
for
this,
they
also
covered
that
we
cite
it
in
a
fact
that
3616
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
a
more
restricted
statute
than
145
(b),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
taken
a
position
anywhere
in
the
course
of
this
litigation?
that
--
that
the
duty
--
that
the
duty
of
a
judge
and
the
district
judge
to
inform
that
only
the
one
year,
i
repeat,
one
year,
probably?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
exceeded
its
power
in
imposing
sentence.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
charge,
isn't
it?
your
charge
has
to
be
that
one,
do
i
understand
that
that
should
make
it
moot
that
congress
for
the
case
of
murder,
congress
can
leave
it
to
the
jury,
to
fix
punishment
and
indicate
what
punishment.
certainly,
it
hasn't
done
for
this
case
and
ordinary
reading
(inaudible)
use
of
that
conclusion.
now,
when
it
comes
to
that,
you
might
argue
it's
the
duty
of
the
judge
where
you
have
two
statutes
or
identically
the
same
conduct
out
for
criminal,
one
five
years
and
one
year,
the
duty
to
impose
in
the
assertion.
i
asked
whether
you
in
any
way
have
taken
the
position
that
the
duty
of
the
judge
to
impose
that
and
if
you
take
that
position
before
the
court
of
appeals,
are
you
taking
that
to
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
position
that
the
petitioner
be
consummated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
served
the,
what
would
be
a
year
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
--
if
that
crime
is
taken,
then
--
then
the
problem
arises
and
that
you
thought
to
get
him
out
on
habeas
corpus
on
that
theory
that
the
(inaudible)
if
we
have
a
difference
question,
wouldn't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be,
yes,
but
of
course,
keep
in
mind
that
he
was
convicted
here
on
three
counts
and
the
trial
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
wasn't
ruled
on
this
law
of
transgression
from
trying
to
about
it.
that
confronts
the
u.s.
attorney
everyday
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
there
hasn't
been
any
--
such
as
a
grandjury
indictment,
the
front
view
for
the
attempts
which
may
lead
to
x
years
or
under
a
statutes
on
the
same
facts
or
growing
out
of
the
same
facts
which
would
only
give
a
sentence
of
x
minus
five
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
disagree
because
that's
done
every
day
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
saying
there's
a
large
area
of
discretion
which
is
inescapable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
(inaudible)
shows
to
tell
you
to
state
that
--
that
so
far
as
the
jury
knows,
not
one
with
of
a
different
charge
goes
to
the
jury
under
one
statute
than
the
other.
and
what's
the
whole
argument
by
then
considers
(inaudible)
is
a
problem
of
sentences.
and
no
use
of
taking
a
rule
lesser
included
in
the
greater
offense
and
make
it
stand
on
its
head
and
make
less
of
equal
identity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
lesser
means
less
than
something
different
in
–
as
a
linear
thing,
six
inches
is
less
than
nine
inches,
or
a
equals
a
or
x
equals
x
or
x
equals
s,
can
you
demonstrate
x
equals
lesser
unless
you
would
give
us
something
then
talk
by
those
meanings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
to
say
it
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
date
--
what
--
what
does
he
argue?
what
is
the
terror
to
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
explains
the
word
--
that
explains
the
word
“evaluation.”
i'd
take
it,
that's
the
first
customs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
elman,
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to,
if
i
might
have
stated
what
really
is
this
--
this
case
is
about?
because
as
i
understand
it,
this
was
--
the
error
was
alleged
the
failure
to
give
a
charge,
and
it's
alleged
that
that
entitled
the
defendant
of
a
new
trial.
proper
charge
was
denied,
and
in
the
effect
of
the
outcome,
they
decided
to
a
new
trial.
that
was
the
issue
that
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals.
now
i
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
namely,
refusal
to
grant
a
charge
which
it
was
error
to
refuse.
now,
i
would
like
to
know
where
that
charge
is
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
number
12,
not
the
end
of
it.
i
see
section
3616
(a)
title
26.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
evidently
part
of
the
requested
charge
that's
being
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
is
there
in
that
charge
that
bears
on
the
allegations
of
the
indictment?
what
is
there
in
the
requested
charge
that
was
denied
which
was
relevant
to
that
charge
in
the
indictment
because
it's
not
given
by
the
trial
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
ultimately
an
error
in
that
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sometimes
it's
not
under
the
record
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
everything
in
that
gets
to
elect
the
question
of
query
is
contained
in
the
charge
given
by
the
court,
he
doesn't
have
to
give
the
same
thing
and
the
same
words
or
different
words
asked
by
the
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
let's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
talk
about
that.
assume
that
argument,
prior
to
2255,
the
claim
that
a
fact
was
--
it
was
accepted
would
--
would
have
to
be
--
it
was
raised
--
raised
above
by
habeas
corpus,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
wasn't
raised
for
both
--
it
couldn't
be
raised
prematurely
i.e.,
it
couldn't
be
raised
until
the
proper
sentence,
the
legal
sentence
has
been
served,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
out
of
conviction,
but
am
i
right
though
that
assuming
that
since
2255,
that
is
no
longer
a
choice,
that
you
could
go
back
if
that's
removed
before
the
sentencing
forth
or
resentencing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

pardon?
