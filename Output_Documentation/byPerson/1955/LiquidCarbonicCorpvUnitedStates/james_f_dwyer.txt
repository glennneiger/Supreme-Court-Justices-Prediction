mr.
james
f.
dwyer
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
defendant,
liquid
carbonic
corporation,
from
the
final
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
enjoining
this
defendant
from
using
its
plants
at
long
island
city,
new
york
and
indianapolis,
indiana
for
producing,
storing
or
distributing
carbon
dioxide
or
dry
ice.
the
appeal
is
moved
with
respect
to
the
plant
at
long
island
city
which
has
been
sold
since
the
entry
of
this
order.
the
appellant
invoked
this
court's
jurisdiction
upon
the
ground
that
the
order
was
a
final
one
made
in
a
sherman
act
--
in
a
sherman
act
case,
a
civil
action.
and
this
court
knows
that
probable
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal
by
its
order
of
february
14th,
1955.
now,
what
is
the
question
involved
in
this
appeal?
the
question
involved
in
this
appeal
is
whether
the
district
court
has
any
power
to
enjoin
the
defendant
from
the
use
of
its
property
when
concededly
the
consent
decree
which
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
source
of
power
says
nothing
whatever
about
the
court's
right
to
enjoin
the
use
of
defendant's
property.
we
urge
that
the
court
has
done
violence
to
the
language
of
the
consent
decree
that
it
--
its
order
has
imposed
an
obligation
upon
liquid
not
embodied
either
expressly
or
implicitly
in
the
compact
which
liquid
has
made
with
the
government
and
that
the
order
best
deprives
liquid
of
its
property
without
due
process
of
law.
the
appeal
involves
the
meaning
of
language
which
to
all
parties
including
the
district
court,
the
appellee,
the
appellant
and
the
district
judge
seemed
clear
and
unambiguous.
the
language
is
to
be
found
in
section
9
(e)
of
the
decree
which
your
honors
will
find
at
page
83
of
the
record
on
appeal.
now,
that
section
in
brief
provides
that
liquid
is
to
dispose
of
its
two
plants
as
provided
by
section
9
(e)
and
subject
to
the
conditions
therein
stated
within
one
year
from
the
entry
of
the
decree
through
a
trustee
to
be
appointed
by
the
court
at
a
fair
evaluation
having
some
relation
to
an
appraisal
made
by
a
court
appointed
appraiser
and
to
a
person
or
persons
who
operate
the
plants
for
the
production
of
carbon
dioxide
or
dry
ice.
the
trustee
failed
in
his
efforts
to
sell
the
plants
although
the
district
judge
on
several
occasions
extended
his
time
to
do
so.
there
is
no
question
now
that
the
purpose
of
the
trustee's
appointment
has
seized
the
trustee's
office
has
been
terminated
by
order
of
the
district
judge,
and
the
properties
are
still
in
the
possession
of
liquid
except
as
i
noted
before
with
respect
to
long
island
city
plant
which
only
recently
was
sold.
now,
the
trustee
having
been
terminated
or
the
trusteeship
having
been
terminated,
the
government
then
made
a
motion
before
the
district
judge
for
an
order
of
compulsory
sale
of
the
plants.upon
the
argument
of
that
motion,
upon
inquiry
from
the
court,
the
united
states
or
the
assistant
attorney
general
informed
the
court
that
in
his
opinion,
he
did
not
believe
the
court
could
enjoin
liquid
from
using
the
plant
without
violating
the
terms
of
the
order
or
as
he
put
it
without
an
effect
modifying
the
decree.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
where
did
that
appear?
that
appeared
in
the
colloquy
and
as
i
recall
it,
the
first
hearing
before
the
district
judge
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
--
and
my
associate
mr.
(inaudible)
will
probably
find
in
a
minute,
and
we
think
he
rightly
so
informed
the
court
because
we
think
an
injunction
imposed
upon
us
when
no
provision
for
such
injunction
appears
in
this
consent
decree
is
in
effect
of
modification
of
the
order
without
any
hearing,
any
issues
having
them
formulated,
any
findings
of
fact
involved.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
that
was
an
injunction
against
our
using
the
plant
for
the
production
of
carbon
dioxide,
the
storing
of
it
or
the
distribution
of
it.
originally,
the
judge
limited
his
order
to
the
production
of
--
of
carbon
dioxide.
i
then
made
a
--
an
application
for
reargument
and
stressed
in
our
application
that
we
had
not
been
given
an
opportunity
to
argue.
the
question
finally
decided
by
the
judge
sua
sponte
and
he
granted
reargument
on
that
sole
issue.
and
then,
having
heard
the
argument
or
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
he
said,
that
while
he
was
thinking
about
the
decision
which
he
had
made,
he
decided
that
it
was
too
narrow
and
that
he
should
enjoin
us
also
from
using
these
plants
for
the
distribution
or
storage
of
carbon
dioxide.
the
idea
i
supposed
in
the
judges
mind
being
that
if
we're
able
to
use
these
plants
to
carry
on
our
business,
we
might
very
easily
transport
carbon
dioxide
from
a
nearby
plant
or
plant
in
an
adjoining
state
and
thus
continue
distribution
of
carbon
dioxide
in
these
two
areas.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
my
recollection
is
that
over
a
year
and
half.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
oh
yes,
we
use
it.
we
we're
required
your
honor
to
keep
these
plants
up
to
our
standard
of
operation
all
during
that
period.
and
we
were
entitled,
so
the
judge
said
to
use
the
plants
during
that
period.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
did
except
that
in
the
long
island
city
plant
which
we
had
continuously
pointed
out
to
the
district
judge
was
a
high
cost
plant
in
which
no
one
would
be
interested
in
buying.
there,
we
seized
the
production
of
co2
after
sometime
and
for
awhile
used
it
merely
as
a
center
of
distribution.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
yes.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
goes
to
the
very
question
which
lies
at
the
heart
the
court's
right
or
his
power
to
--
to
impose
an
injunction
upon
us.
the
district
judge
rationalize
his
--
the
exercise
of
the
power
in
this
way.
he
said,
this
order
has
two
purposes.
one
is
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
the
decree
i
mean.
i
--
i
shouldn't
mean
--
i
shouldn't
say
the
order
--
the
original
decree
has
two
purposes.
the
first
is
to
prevent
liquid
from
using
its
property
and
the
second
is
to
bring
in
a
competitor
in
the
area
that
is
one
who
will
purchase
the
property.
we
say
that
he
had
no
right
to
read
any
of
such
dual
purpose
in
the
order.so
the
order
is
unitary
and
has
but
a
single
purpose
and
that
a
limited
purpose.
now,
in
going
back
--
in
rationalizing
he
said,
“i
must
look
at
the
complaint.
i
must
take
into
consideration
the
philosophy
of
the
sherman
act.”
and
if
these
defendants
are
right,
that
the
trustee
having
been
frustrated
for
having
failed
and
they
have
the
right
to
use
these
plants.
well
then,
the
sherman
act
has
been
frustrated.
this
decree
doesn't
mean
anything.
now,
more
argument,
our
answer
to
the
--
to
the
district
judge
and
the
argument
which
we
make
before
this
court
is
that
the
district
judge
had
no
right
to
resort
to
the
decree
or
to
the
--
to
the
complaint
since
we
have
denied
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
consent
decree
expressly
acknowledges
the
fact
that
we
do
not
admit
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
deny
those
allegations.
we
say,
he
had
no
write
to
resort
to
the
general
purposes
of
the
sherman
act
because
we
never
conceded
for
a
second
that
anyone
of
these
plants
that
we
had
acquired,
we
had
acquired
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
in
effect,
what
he
has
found
by
this
decree
is
that
we
have
violated
and
yet
we
had
no
trial,
we
had
no
hearings.
he
made
no
findings
of
fact.
this
was
an
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
defendant,
liquid
carbonic,
and
the
other
defendants
to
consent
to
do
certain
things
and
we
say
it
has
no
meaning,
no
purpose
beyond
that.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
i
think
the
allowable
inferences
the
ones
i
wish
he
would
make
are
that
after
having
been
subjected
to
litigation
for
ten
years,
this
thing
started
back
in
1940
with
the
grand
jury
investigation.
we
produced
tons
of
records
over
a
two-year
period
before
that
grand
jury
and
failed
to
do
anything.
we
were
then
subjected
to
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
which
lasted
four
years
and
which
resulted
in
a
--
in
a
consent
decree
that
was
unsatisfactory
apparently
to
the
attorney
general
because
it
hardly
had
the
--
was
the
ink
dry
on
that
consent
of
federal
trade
commission
order
when
he
filed
summons
and
complaint
in
the
district
court
in
brooklyn
on
1948.
we
had
reached
the
posture
in
this
case
where
we
were
moving
the
case
for
a
trial.
where
we
were
insisting
that
the
government
furnished
evidence
as
to
--
or
furnish
--
furnish
us
with
information
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
do
on
the
trial
when
--
because
of
those
circumstances
and
that
the
suggestion
of
the
district
judge,
conferences
were
held
to
see
if
the
matter
could
not
be
disposed.
the
district
judge
was
informed
by
the
--
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
that
this
case
might
well
take
a
year
to
try.
it
involves
the
activities,
the
acts,
conducts
and
practices
of
all
of
this
industry
since
1925.
now,
the
inference
which
i
think
you
may
fairly
draw,
the
inferences
which
i
think
are
present
in
any
settlement
is
that
one
--
both
parties
wanted
to
reach
some
compromise
and
save
expense.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
where
in
the
record
the
assistant
attorney
general
had
indicated
that
he
believe
that
if
the
judge
granted
an
injunction
of
what
constitute
a
modification
of
the
decree,
that
colloquy
will
be
found
at
page
6
of
the
record
and
i
think
that
in
conjunction
with
that,
in
fairness,
you
should
read
what
mr.
karsted
later
said
at
page
36.
that
was
the
second
hearing,
and
while
on
the
--
at
the
first
hearing,
he
felt
that
the
--
an
injunction
would
constitute
on
unwarranted
modification.
after
he
returned
home
to
washington,
he
changed
his
mind
and
then
informed
the
court
that
he
thought
that
an
injunction
would
not
constitute
a
modification,
and
it's
at
page
36
that
he
so
informed
the
court.
now,
before
proceeding
with
my
argument,
i
would
also
like
to
refer
to
a
--
a
portion
of
the
record
which
i
think
bears
upon
the
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
yesterday
as
to
what
implications
could
be
drawn
with
respect
to
liquid's
consent
to
the
decree,
and
i
said
that
such
implications
could
be
drawn
as
only
we're
consistent
with
a
limited
language
used
in
section
9
(e).
and
i
said
further
that
i
thought
that
the
district
judge
had
no
power
to
resort
to
the
philosophy
of
the
sherman
act
or
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
and
down
at
--
at
--
fully
on
53,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
page
29,
the
judge
asked
me,
“was
the
purpose
of
that,”
that
is
of
section
9
(e),
“to
furnish
new
competition
in
an
area
whereby
agreement
between
the
parties,”
it
was
determined
not
decided,
“but
determined
that
liquid
exercised
a
degree
of
monopoly,”
and
i
rejected
that
contention
and
said
that
no
such
inference
could
be
drawn.
but
nevertheless,
that
is
the
inference
that
the
judge
drew
that
we
had
been
found
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
i
express
again
that
there
is
no
basis
whatever
for
any
such
deduction.
now
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no
findings
of
fact
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
yes,
with
an
expressed
statement
that
they
--
the
defendant
had
denied
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
i
think
in
large
part,
that
followed
the
usual
kind
of
decree
that
the
government
asked
the
defendant
to
sign,
except
at
various
places
where
modifications
occurred
and
section
9
(e)
is
one
of
them,
those
places.
now,
as
i
was
saying
yesterday,
the
--
the
court
rationalized
its
order
in
this
way.
it
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
consent
decree
was
two-fold.
first,
to
divest
liquid
of
its
plants
and
secondly
to
bring
competition
into
the
area
and
opposition
of
course
was
that
the
purpose
of
this
section
of
the
decree
was
to
bring
a
competitor
into
the
area
and
that
we
can
send
it
to
sell
our
plants
on
the
assumption
that
the
government
would
find
a
purchaser.
although,
we
had
pointed
out,
and
this
appears
in
the
record,
to
the
district
judge
that
we
have
reminded
the
united
states
and
reminded
the
judge
in
the
course
of
the
--
the
negotiations
on
the
consent
decree,
that
in
our
opinion,
these
plants
would
not
be
bought
by
anybody
who
would
operate
them
as
to
co2
manufacturing
plants.
so,
really,
what
was
involved
here
when
the
decree
was
submitted
was
a
contention
on
our
side
that
these
plants
would
not
be
sold
but
let
--
we
were
willing
to
take
the
risk
on
our
judgment
on
that
point
against
the
government's
insistence
that
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
bring
a
competitor
into
the
field.
now,
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
there
was
all
of
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
can't
say
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no,
it
isn't.
it
isn't.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no,
actually
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no,
except
--
except
as
it
appears
in
the
colloquy
between
the
district
judge
and
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
yes,
that
--
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
that's
right.
that's
in
the
record,
and
they
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
yes,
i
can,
page
15,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
principal
paragraph.
there,
where
i
said
to
the
district
judge,
your
honor,
i
can
say
this
in
my
own
knowledge
that
i
reiterate
it
to
your
honor,
until
the
government
counsel
and
mr.
stevens,
who
is
my
partner,
even
more
than
i.
and
we
said
the
same
things
to
mr.
timberg
and
his
associates.
my
recollection
is
that
he
said
this
to
you,
mr,
stevens,
that
we
knew
from
our
experience
that
no
person
would
buy
the
plant
at
long
island
city.
he
said
it
was
a
high-cost
plant
to
operate
and
he
said
further
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
we
sold
it,
yes.
we
sold
it.
not
a
co2
plant
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
we
sold
the
property
and
the
reason,
the
reason
for
the
--
for
the
court
agreeing
to
the
appointment
of
an
appraiser
was
because
he
recognized
our
argument
that
the
real
estate
value
of
the
plants
might
be
much
more
than
the
value
of
the
plants
if
somebody
had
to
operate
them
for
co2
purposes.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
oh,
well,
this
of
course
was
after
the
decree
had
been
signed
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no,
it
is
not.
this
was
after
the
government
brought
the
motion
to
compel
us
to
sell
the
plant.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
oh,
yes.
i'm
recalling
here
what
had
occurred
prior
to
the
decree.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
before
the
court
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no,
except
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no,
they
certainly
didn't
on
this
argument.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
well
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
he
--
he
signed
that,
i
think
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
why
did
i?
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
well,
because
the
judge
was
--
was
saying,
i
think
of
--
in
the
manner
which
precedes
this.
well,
as
i
recall
or
i
think,
when
--
and
then
i
was
trying
to
refresh
his
recollection
as
to
what
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
no.
no,
i
can't
say
that
he
did.
he
was
kept
informed
that
we
were
having
these
negotiations
and
some
of
them
took
place
in
his
presence.
and
from
time
to
time,
he
asked
us
a
reason
for
insisting
on
this
or
refusing
to
do
that.
but
when
the
decree
was
presented
to
him,
so
far
as
i
can
now
recall,
he
--
he
signed
the
decree
as
--
as
a
pro
forma
act.
now,
the
judge
--
the
judge
said,
“well,
since
i
can't
compel
a
sale
of
the
plant
under
this
decree,
i'll
do
the
next
best
thing.
i'll
stop
you
from
using
it,
and
in
that
way,
we
will
have
achieved
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
decree.
then,
we
will
put
liquid
out
of
business.”
and
now,
any
--
his
decree
has
brought
enough
as
i
said
yesterday
to
prevent
us
from
using
the
plant
for
anything.
we
were
in
effect
compelled
to
sell
that
plant
as
quickly
as
we
can
to
avoid
the
cost
of
maintenance
of
the
plant.
so,
he
--
he
then
entered
an
order
which
he
said,
“your
enjoined
from
using
this
plant
and
i'll
deny
the
government's
motion
for
an
order
of
sale
without
prejudice
to
a
renewal.”
now,
the
reasoning,
it
seems
to
me,
becomes
more
involved
on
the
judge's
part,
because
in
the
first
place,
he
said,
“i
can't
compel
a
sale
under
this
decree.
i
have
no
power,
but
i'm
going
to
imply
that
--
draw
the
inference
that
i
can
require
association
of
use.”
and
then,
i
asked
him
why.
he
gave
a
government
leave
to
renew
a
motion,
to
put
an
order
of
sale
when
he's
denied
it,
and
his
reasoning
run
this
way.
he
said,
“well,
the
government
has
said
in
a
brief
that
an
injunction
might
involve
it
in
a
--
in
a
difficulty
of
policing,
see
that
we're
obeying
it.”
and
he
said,
“so,
i
then
decided
that
if
you
didn't
obey,
they
should
have
a
right
to
come
in
here
and
ask
me
for
an
order
of
sale.”
in
other
words,
he
deemed
it
that
and
within
his
power
of
punishing
for
a
contempt,
should
we
disobey
this
order
which
had
not
yet
been
ended,
that
he
could
compel
to
us
sell
the
plant?
the
power
which
i
think
can't
be
found
in
--
in
the
equity
powers
of
the
federal
court.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
no
searching
for
sustenance
of
power
such
as
he
endeavor
to
find
here,
going
to
the
pleadings,
going
to
the
philosophy
of
the
sherman
act
is
permissible.
and
we
say
that
such
an
attempt
is
in
--
it
--
it
contradicts
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
ford
case.
your
honors
will
probably
recall
that
in
the
ford
case,
ford
had
agreed
to
disaffiliate
itself
with
a
finance
company,
on
condition
that
the
government
should
within
a
specified
time
compel
general
motors
likewise
to
disaffiliate,
and
a
consent
decree
was
entered
on
that
basis
by
the
government
and
ford.
and
for
years,
thereafter,
the
government
let
lay
a
--
an
action
in
the
federal
court
against
general
motors,
didn't
prosecute
it.
and
in
ford,
a
mode
in
--
in
the
district
court
for
an
order
releasing
it
from
the
shackles
of
this
restraint
that
had
been
placed
upon
it.
the
district
judge
denied
its
motion,
gave
the
government
more
time
and
this
court
reversed
the
--
the
district
court
and
required
an
order
to
be
entered
releasing
ford
from
the
restraint.
and
in
connection
with
that
release,
this
court
said
that
the
district
judge
had
no
power
to
resort
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
because
there,
the
district
judge
said,
“well,
ford
in
effect
is
--
is
guilty
of
a
--
of
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,”
but
this
court
said,
“no
such
finding
is
permissible,
because
the
decree
was
a
consent
decree.”
that's
the
situation
here.
there's
no
finding
that
we
have
violated
the
sherman
act.
now,
i
would
like
briefly
to
go
over
the
subsections
of
--
of
this
section
9
(e)
to
show,
your
honors,
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
an
implication
of
a
right
to
issue
an
injunction.
now,
that
--
that
consent
decree
is
in
the
record
at
--
what
page
is
that
one?
yes
--
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
page
83,
yesterday
i
cited.
now,
subsection
1
of
that
section
states
that
within
one
year
from
the
entry
of
the
decree,
liquid
showed
dispose
of
the
plants,
quote
“pursuant
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
section
9.”
now,
it's
not
worthy
that
the
plants
includes
not
merely
real-estate
buildings
and
production
equipment,
but
also
production
and
sales
records,
which
indicates
that
the
plant
was
to
be
sold
to
somebody
who
would
come
in
and
operate
it
for
purposes
of
competition.
and
subsection
2
provides
that
the
plants
shall
be
sold
through
a
trustee
forthwith.
now,
terms
of
office
were
to
be
one
year
with
the
right
of
the
court
to
extend
it,
whenever
a
showing
was
made
that
there
may
be
persons
who
have
an
interest
in
operating
the
plant.
as
i
said,
his
time
was
extended
and
he
was
unable
to
find
anybody
who
would
operate
the
plant.
section
--
subdivision
3
is
designed
to
protect
us
from
his
for
sale
at
an
adequate
price
and
as
you
will
see,
to
bring
a
new
competitor
into
the
area.
it
provides
that
the
purchase
price
shall
have
a
--
do
regard
for
the
evaluation
made
by
the
court
appraiser
and
that
the
plant
shall
not
be
sold
to
anybody
who
is
connected
with
this
defendant
or
with
any
of
the
other
defendants
in
the
action
and
--
and
only
to
a
person
who
will
operate
the
plant
for
co2
purposes.
and
subdivision
4
requires
us
to
maintain
the
plants
at
our
customary
standards
until
sold
by
the
trustee.
now,
the
judge
--
now,
the
--
the
government
of
course
insisted
that
--
that
a
sale
of
this
plant
would
have
the
effect
of
--
of
precluding
us
from
selling
or
from
operating
within
this
area.
that's
the
very
basis
upon
which
this
order
is
found.
yet,
that
is
a
--
a
truly
erroneous
conception
because
if
the
judge
has
power
to
enjoin
us,
then
under
section
9
(g)
of
this
decree,
we
can
instantly
commence
the
construction
of
a
new
and
larger
plant.
so,
obviously,
it
wasn't
the
purpose
of
this
decree
to
put
us
out
of
the
carbon
dioxide
business
in
these
two
areas.
the
main
--
the
purpose
and
the
real
purpose
was
to
bring
a
competitor
into
the
area.
otherwise,
why
would
section
9
(g)
permit
us
to
come
in
and
build
a
new
plant?
now,
the
--
the
decree
or
the
order
of
the
judge
in
this
case,
also
is
in
contradiction
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
hughes
case.
the
hughes
case
or
the
consent
decree
required
hughes
either
to
sell
his
stock
in
one
of
the
two
companies.
that
is
the
--
the
distribution
company
or
the
production
company
or
to
put
the
stock
in
a
voting
trust.
he
put
the
stock
in
a
voting
trust
and
then
the
united
states
came
into
the
district
court
and
said
we
want
the
--
the
stock
sold
because
hughes
is
--
is
--
has
an
--
has
an
interest
in
the
other
phase
of
this
business.
the
--
this
court
refused
to
order
hughes
to
sell
the
stock.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
the
last
order,
yes,
sir.
the
order
that
was
entered.
it's
at
page
96,
i
believe.
that's
the
order
appealed
from.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
starts
at
page
96
and
runs
over
to
page
98.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
yes.
we
were
served
merely
with
a
notice
of
motion
for
a
construction
of
the
decree
and
we
opposed
it
on
the
ground
that
the
court
had
no
power
to
order
a
sale
from
the
language
in
the
decree.
and
--
well,
i
think
you
will
find
in
the
argument
that
--
and
in
the
briefs
that
we
submitted.
we
pointed
out
that
any
sale
now
would
constitute
a
modification
and
the
minimum
that
we're
entitled
to
was
a
hearing.
the
court
would
have
to
have
witnesses
before
it
to
prove
how
competition
was
going
to
be
effective
if
the
plants
were
to
be
sold.
we
had
no
such
hearing.
the
court
in
his
opinion
felt
--
thought
that
it
was
entirely
unnecessary
with
just
a
matter
of
construing
this
language.
we
pointed
out
to
him
that
carbon
dioxide
had
been
used
to
more
industries.
it
was
used
in
hospitals
that
he'd
have
to
take
into
consideration
what
the
effect
on
the
economy
around
the
indianapolis
area
would
be.
but
he
seemed
to
think
that
that
was
not
necessary.
we
think
that
due
process
requires
the
court
to
give
us
an
opportunity
or
rather
to
--
to
--
an
order,
that
such
an
order
may
be
ended.
that
the
government
proved
that
there
is
some
relation
between
the
wrongful
act
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
the
relief
which
they're
seeking.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
well,
i
--
i
think
i
can't
find
it.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
can't
pick
it
out
readily
in
this
record.
mr.
james
f.
dwyer
i'll
be
--
all
right,
i
would
be
happy
to
do
that.
