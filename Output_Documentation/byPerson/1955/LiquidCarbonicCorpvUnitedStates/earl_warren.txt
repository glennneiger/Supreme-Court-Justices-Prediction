mr.

chief
justice
earl

we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
25,
on
a
docket,
the
liquid
carbonic
corporation
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
dwyer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
the
main
thrust
of
this
section
(e)
that
you'd
be
--
then
reading?
is
that
for
the
purpose
of
producing
production
or
is
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
increasing
competition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
language
in
--
in
that
indicates
that
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
decreasing
their
production?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
wouldn't
--
it
would
result
in
--
in
reduction
of
their
production,
but
the
government
wanted
--
wanted
the
plants
to
be
used
for
the
production
of
--
of
sale
too,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
that
be
the
main
reason
for
(e)
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why
the
government
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
have
put
in
that
decree
if
it
intended
to
close
them
out
in
the
event
they
couldn't
solve.
why
they
wouldn't
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
have
provided
in
the
decree
that
it
should
only
be
sold
for
fairer
value
that
they
should
have
an
appraiser,
recognized
appraiser
to
appraise
it
and
there's
the
aim
that
that
contemplates
a
fair
market
value
of
--
of
these
plants
as
a
growing
concern.
that's
the
said
value
of
it
if
it's
closed
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
language
that
do
indicate
that
they
had
any
other
intention
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
time
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
when
the
court
undertook
to
you
this
implied
power
that
--
that
you
say
was
there
to
order
close
this
long
island
plant,
does
it
give
the
company
a
hearing
on
the
effect
upon
congress,
the
effect
upon
their
business
or
both?
what
the
result
of
this
action
will
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
no
request
by
the
company
(inaudible)--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dwyer,
would
you
in
just
a
minute
of
so
to
state
your
position
on
due
process
so
far
as
the
failure
to
accord
your
company
any
hearing
on
this
modification
of
the
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
you
could
send
a
memorandum
to
--
to
mr.
justice
harlan
if
you
will
consider.
