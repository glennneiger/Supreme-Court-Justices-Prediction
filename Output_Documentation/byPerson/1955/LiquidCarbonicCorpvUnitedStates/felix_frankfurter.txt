mr.

the
decree
--
the
date
of
decree
is
march
7,
1953?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
between
--
after
that
decree,
how
much
time
elapsed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
during
that
period
you
use
it
as
a
matter
of
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
relation
of
these
plants
was
to
the
purpose
of
the
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
order
the
original?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
in
your
view
the
allowable
inference
is
drawn
from
the
fact
that
he
did
consent
this
decree
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
the
record
--
i
do
not
know
whether
it
should
whether
it
should
be
entitled
to
consider
it,
but
does
the
record
disclose
that
there
were
--as
we
see
these
negotiations
as
to
discern
the
included
in
the
consent
decree
other
than
the
form.
were
there
any
preliminary
office
in
store,
all
that
kind
of
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
possibly
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rules,
what
we
consider
it
we're
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
you
which
you've
just
referred?
is
this
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
which
you
indicated
that
probably,
there
would
be
no
bias
or
compared
as
to
what
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
applied
--
if
you
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible),
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
sold
that
--
this
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
these
colloquy
from
which
you
are
reading,
we
are
in
rather
detailed
discussion
to
the
view
within
it
in
persuading
the
judge
if
you
can't
send
a
decree
to
which
he
presents
digits
--
by
this
--
like
the,
the
argument
or
to
have
a
consent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
before
--
is
this
how
the
--
on
this
issue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
to
be
contemporaneous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you're
--
you're
recalling
here
a
set
of
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
not
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
the
government
doesn't
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
your
--
i
don't
mean
to
judge
the
conviction
and
the
right
to
be
followed,
a
question
of
memory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
--
is
it
--
do
you
happen
to
know
the
consent
decree
of
time
performed
by
the
district
judge
or
where
the
--
and
it
has
to
be
satisfying
with
particularity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
was
it
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
make
that
for
each
--
from
which
you
recall?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
as
the
matter,
at
the
time
of
the
consent
decree
was
under
consideration
by
the
district
judge,
if
he
have
to
be
discreet,
if
he
have
even
reach
them,
require
as
to
the
decree
to
which
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
it
didn't
require
much
imagination
to
contemplate
that
intention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
other
things
would
happen
apart
from
this
--
these
forfeitures?
what
other
strict
limitation
based
upon
petitioner
by
the
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
liquid
carbonic
was
one
party
to
the
original
complaint
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
original
complaint
as
against
the
number
of
the
people
engaged
in
this
industry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
was
the
complaint
set
forth
in
a
dominant
position
of
liquid
carbonic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
so
far
as
sherman
law
violation
was
charged
in
the
complaint,
was
the
complaint
made
clear
the
--
the
relation
or
the
significance
with
these
holdings
with
the
holdings
of
these
properties
to
the
things
you
complained
about
originally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
else
to
the
--
as
before,
to
some
implications
of
the
chief
justice's
question?
is
there
anything
that
indicates
the
importance
for
the
government
to
have
--
to
be
sure
that
competitors
pursue
of
this
eminence,
but
the
lead
of
these
commodities
as
against
a
reduced
output
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
national
economy,
anything
on
that
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
so,
that
is
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
that
--
how
does
that
follow
that
because
you
don't
want
an
increase,
therefore
you
should
decrease?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
they
consented
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
what
are
the
differences?
is
there
any
like
the
difference
between
selling
this
thing
as
a
growing
concern
from
selling
as
where
you
see
judgment
(inaudible),
a
bit
possible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
a
profitable
plant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
evidence
is
more
profitable
to
keep
it
going
to
produce
and
sell
it,
really
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
i
can
move
to
get
off.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
that
--
that
--
as
i
assume
to
pick
--
pick
that
in
an
accurate
recollection
to
what
he
said.
may
i
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
was
sold,
i
must
say
that
it
puzzles
me
that
if
the
likelihood
of
inability
to
settle
this
problem,
but
before
the
parties
and
before
the
court
or
before
the
government
that
presents
it,
i'll
repeat
that
actual
victims
will
file
a
motion
which
require
more
than
we'll
suggest
an
imagination
to
say,
well,
let's
provide
it
with
attachment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
what
if
somebody
who
is
knowledgeable
say
that
the
likelihood
of
a
selling
to
his
competitor
(inaudible)
i
shouldn't
think
the
government
or
even
the
court
(inaudible)
of
their
judgment
that
they
bring
me
notice
of
what
happened
because
in
any
event,
it
doesn't
happen.
they
will
have
to
make
the
best
picture
or
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
seems
to
be
(voce
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there's
a
provision
of
health
issue
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
because
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
interesting
well
down
the
hole.
the
government
might
not
at
all,
more
than
(inaudible)
somebody
should
produce
with
these
plants
and
that
they
could
be
shut
down.
