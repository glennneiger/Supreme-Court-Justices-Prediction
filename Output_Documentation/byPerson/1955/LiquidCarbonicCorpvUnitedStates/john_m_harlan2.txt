harlan
mr.
davis,
this
feature
of
the
modified
decree
is
something
that
the
government
did
not
ask
for
itself,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
the
government
didn't
ask
that
alternatively,
the
defendant
should
not
be
--
should
be
enjoined
from
using
his
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
something
that
the
court
came
up
within
its

motion?

mr.
davis,
wouldn't
you
agree
also
that
this
type
of
limited
divestiture
sell
only
to
competitors
was
an
unusual
type
of
consent
decree?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
it
indicate
that
there
was
a
--
it
might
be
a
purpose
to
work
rather
than
an
unusual
form
of
consent
that
they
were
divestiture
sought
and
there's
no
such
limitation
to
put
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
--
before
you
sit
down,
could
you
give
me
the
page
of
the
record
where
the
discussion
takes
place
about
whether
we
or
we're
not
entitled
to
a
hearing?
well,
don't
hold
up
on
it
if
you
haven't
got
any
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
never
mind
now.
