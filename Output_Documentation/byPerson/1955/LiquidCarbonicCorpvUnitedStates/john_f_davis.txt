mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please.
since
this
case
in
effect
turns
upon
the
construction
of
the
original
decree,
i
propose
to
start
with
the
terms
of
that
decree.
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
first
to
section
13
of
the
decree
which
appears
at
page
90,
9-0
of
the
record.
section
13
provides,
jurisdiction
is
retrained
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
any
of
the
parties
to
this
final
decree,
to
apply
to
this
court
at
anytime
for
such
further
orders
and
directions
as
may
be
necessary
or
appropriate
for
the
construction
or
carrying
out
of
this
final
judgement.
now,
for
the
modification
or
amendment
of
any
of
the
provisions
thereof,
the
enforcements
or
compliance
therewith
and
punishment
of
violations
thereof.
i
call
the
attention
to
this
because
this
is
the
reservation
of
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
pursuant
to
which
the
government
asked
for
this
relief.
and
it
makes
very
clear
that
the
parties
themselves
consented
to
appropriate
modifications,
appropriate
constructions,
appropriate
orders
--
orders
for
carrying
out.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
doubt
that
both
the
government
and
liquid
carbonic
agreed
that
under
appropriate
circumstances,
the
court
should
have
power
to
make
modifications.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
i
--
i
presume
is
the
question,
the
basic
question,
is
this
an
appropriate
modification,
is
this
an
appropriate
construction?
and
i
would
think
that
an
appropriate
modification
or
construction
was
one
which
fell
within
the
initial
consent
of
the
parties,
but
since
the
decree
itself
is
based
upon
the
consent
of
the
government
and
the
defendant
in
the
case,
the
modifications
must
in
turn
the
based
upon
that
consent.
and
so,
it
must
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
initial
consent.
turning
from
that,
i
turn
to
the
section
which
is
directly
involved
in
the
decree.
that's
9
(e)
of
the
decree
which
appears
at
page
83.
i
may
say
that
this
is
a
suit
which
was
brought
against
this
defendant
and
several
other
defendants
who
are
manufacturing
carbon
dioxide
and
dry
ice,
alleging
monopoly
and
restraint
of
trade.
and
with
respect
to
this
defendant,
it
was
specifically
alleged
that
liquid
carbonic,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
actions
complained
of
was
that
liquid
carbonic
had
acquired
a
certain
number
of
additional
plants
leading
to
monopoly.
so,
it
was
--
it
was
natural
that
in
the
decree,
there
should
be
provisions
for
divestiture
of
--
of
some
of
these
plants
which
was
alleged
had
resulted
monopoly.
section
9
(e)
deals
with
that
particular
subject.
it
starts
of
by
providing
that
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
the
entry
of
the
final
judgment,
“defendant
liquid
shall,”
pursuant
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
subsection
(e),
“dispose
of
as
complete
units
its
existing
plants
at
long
island
city
in
new
york
and
indianapolis,
indiana,
a
divestiture
provision,
a
provision
that
they
should
get
rid
of
these
plants.”
but
not
consent
--
not
content
with
merely
honoring
divestiture
as
a
finished
twist
to
this
particular
section
of
the
--
of
the
consent
decree
which
required
not
only
that
they
divest
themselves
of
these
plants
but
that
they
sell
them
to
potential
competitors
so
that
there
could
be
active
competition
in
these
particular
areas
unless
a
reduction
of
the
monopoly.
and
that
provision
contained
in
section
3,
subsection
(3)
of
this
9
(e)
which
states
that
the
trustee
shall
dispose
of
these
plants
to
persons
who
will
manufacture
on
carbon
dioxide
and
dry
ice
or
both.
in
other
words,
an
attempt
was
made
to
force
the
defendant
to
sell
to
competitors.
now,
as
mr.
dwyer
has
told
you
during
the
year
and
a
half
following
the
decree,
the
trustee
was
unable
to
make
this
decision
of
these
plants
in
accordance
with
section
9.
unfortunately,
the
decree
couldn't
say
what
was
going
to
happen
when
that
--
when
that
occurred.
and
so,
when
it
became
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
it
didn't,
but
as
the
parties
--
whether
--
in
any
event,
the
parties
made
no
provision
for
it
and
the
question
then
was,
did
that
mean
that
nothing
happened
or
did
it
mean
that
the
divestiture
should
be
carried
through
in
some
other
matters?
and
it
was
defined
better
that
the
government
went
to
the
court
and
said
that
we
haven't
been
able,
the
trustee
hasn't
been
able
to
complete
the
sale
in
--
in
accordance
with
your
honors
order
is
the
decree
to
be
frustrated.
they
--
are
we
not
to
get
--
there's
nothing
to
happen
or
is
something
to
happen
and
we
asked
that
--
the
government
asked
in
that
case
that
it
be
sold
without
being
sold
to
competitors,
that
it
be
sold
for
real
estate
value
or
for
any
other
thing,
just
divested.
it
seeks
to
be
used
to
reduce
the
monopoly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
were
many.
there
were
many
restrictions
about
dealing
with
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
other
matters.
but
as
far
as
this
divestiture,
this
is
the
only
section
that's
--
so
far
as
i
know,
which
deals
with
divestiture
as
such,
producing
the
number
of
plants
that's
involved.
the
others
deal
with
agreements
and
prices
and
--
and
competitive
arrangements
with
--
with
the
other
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
with
production?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
all
in
9.
there
is
the
provision
in
section
9
(g)
with
respect
to
increasing
the
total
number
of
production
units.such
appears
at
page
85,
your
honor.
that's
the
same
section
as
section
9,
but
9
(g)
deals
that
this
--
that
liquid
shall
not
increase
the
total
number
of
productive
units.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
--
not
to
my
recollection,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
for
both
purposes,
your
honor.
the
first
purpose,
it
starts
of
by
saying
they
shall
dispose
of
these
plants.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
no
language
to
that
effect,
except
the
order
that
it
--
that
they
shall
dispose
of
these
plants
in
accordance
which
automatically
results
in
--
in
a
reduction
of
production.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
wanted
competition
in
the
area.
yes,
that's
right.
they
wanted
them
to
be
sold
to
competitors.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
--
the
--
the
main
--
that
is
really
the
question
before
us,
your
honor,
whether
there
was
one
reason,
two
reasons
or
a
combination
of
two
reasons.
now,
i
submit
that
--
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
--
it
may
be
the
matter
of
dropping.
they
start
in
by
saying
they
shall
dispose
of
these
plants.
and
then,
they
spelled
out
a
method
of
disposition
and
it
may
have
been
an
oversight
not
to
state
what
happened
if
they
didn't
dispose
of
them
in
that
way.
that
--
that
must
be
our
assumption,
my
assumption.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
the
--
there
is
no
language
in
the
decree
itself.
in
order
to
determine,
however,
the
--
the
purpose
in
this
decree,
i
think
we
have
some
help
because
of
the
fact
that
the
judge
who
signed
this
decree
after
what
he
says
is
months
and
months
of
conferences,
hours
and
hours
of
dealing
with
this
matter
has
stated
that
it
was
his
understanding
that
the
consent
of
the
parties
to
this
disposition
was
for
these
two
purposes.
and
he
states
this
specifically
in
his
--
in
his
opinion
in
this
case
that
he
believe
there
were
two
purposes
involved
in
this
--
in
this
particular
section
9.
one,
to
require
a
sale
to
cut
down
on
the
productive
capacity
of
the
defendant,
and
two,
what
i
call
that
the
twist
that
was
given
to
it,
not
only
that
they
should
sell
them,
but
that
they
should
sell
it
to
a
potential
competitor.
now,
the
court,
--
naturally
the
parties
for
this
consent
decree,
look
at
this
--
looking
at
this
thing
from
hindsight
will
disagree
as
to
what
the
--
what
the
intent
was.
we
each
see
it,
see
the
intent
from
our
present
argument,
but
the
court
who
was
then
in
an
impartial
position
and
who
was
passing
upon
this
matter
of
a
court
order
from
the
point
of
view
of
protecting
the
public,
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
the
act,
the
judge
believed
that
the
consent
of
the
parties
in
this
case
was
to
achieve
these
two
objectives,
and
that
is
specifically
found
as
i
say
in
his
--
in
his
opinion
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
--
no.
well,
it
--
i
don't
think
it
does
the
dominant
position.
it's
mentioned
that
there
two
companies.
the
complaint,
by
the
way,
is
set
forth
in
pulling
the
record
starting
at
page
46.
and
it
mentions
two
national
companies,
liquid
carbonic
and
i
believe
the
other
was
pure
carbonic
incorporated
who
had
the
factories
throughout
the
united
states.
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
allegation
or
any
attempt
to
prove
that
liquid
carbonic
was
anymore
predominant
in
the
field
than
pure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
alleges
acquisition
of
additional
facilities
for
the
manufacturer
in
an
attempt
to
monopolize
beginning
and
i
believe
the
year
1932,
although
i'm
not
quite
sure,
i
think
it's
in
1932
and
naming
for
liquid
carbonic
and
pure,
the
acquisition
of
a
number
of
properties.
now,
i
must
confess
that
i
cannot,
from
this
record,
identify
these
plants
for
these
companies
which
are
--
which
are
required,
but
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
complaint
itself
refers
to
the
importance
of
dry
ice
and
carbon
dioxide,
both
gas
and
liquid
in
industry
and
from
refrigeration.
and
there
are
some
indication,
which
i
refer
it
doesn't
--
isn't
helpful
--
particularly
helpful
to
me,
but
--
that
a
carbon
dioxide
was
in
short
supply
at
least
at
the
time
the
action
was
--
was
commenced.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yeah,
that
has
some
relevance.
there
is
--
the
argument
that
is
made
as
to
the
--
the
--
i
may
say
this
to
--
as
to
the
long
island
plant
that
the
long
island
plant
was
not
used
for
the
production
of
either
carbon
dioxide
or
--
or
dry
ice
at
the
time
of
this
decree.
i
think
that's
right,
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
was
ceased
very
soon
afterwards
anyway.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
ceased
very
soon
afterwards.
it
wasn't
an
economic
plant
and
there
wasn't
any
real
reduction
in
the
--
in
the
supply
through
that
plant.
mr.
john
f.
davis
indianapolis,
i
think
was
and
still
is
in
production
of
both
carbon
dioxide
and
dry
ice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
an
attempt
to
keep
them
from
building
up
further
monopoly
then
require
not
to
build
within
400
miles
of
existing
plants.
and
as
far
as
the
long
island
goes,
there
was
a
plant
in
--
in
new
jersey.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
nearest
plant
in
indianapolis,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
but
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
actually
on
the
record
that
comes
from
us,
we
don't
know
the
business,
the
facts
of
the
business
life
of
this
--
of
this
carbon
dioxide
and
dry
ice
business.
i
--
i
must
assume
in
the
absence
of
--
of
knowledge
to
the
contrary
that
if
there's
a
vacuum,
if
there's
a
reduction
in
production
by
these
people
and
they
demand
parts
that
it
will
be
filled
by
competition.
i
mean
that
manufacture
of
dry
ice
from
carbon
dioxide
has
been
going
on
for
many,
many
years
and
it's
a
matter
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
supply
and
demand.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
entered
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
could
have
been,
yes.
and
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
they
--
if
they
have
consented
to
it,
we
wouldn't
have
any
lawsuit
today.
i
mean,
we
have
this
question
if
whether
or
not
this
is
implicit
really
or
whether
it
is
basic
to
the
original
order
so
that
it
is
proper
now
to
impose
this
obligation.
if
it's
been
done
specifically
and
there's
no
question
that
it
could
have
been
done
specifically
if
--
if
the
parties
have
agreed
to
it
by
--
we
just
would
have
no
lawsuit.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
reserves
the
power
to
make
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
what
--
what
they
could
have
done,
what
the
parties
in
essence
were
in
agreement
--
in
agreement
on.
it
has
to
have
been
something
which
was
comprehended
within
the
original
agreement.
the
--
the
position
of
carbonic
is
that
the
sale
to
a
competitor
was
really
a
condition
of
the
order
to
dispose
of
these
plants.
that
--
that
i
think
is
--
is
a
peculiar
--
peculiar
argument
because
it
is
--
it's
unusual
to
--
for
a
person
against
to
whom
an
order
is
issued
to
make
a
condition
which
adds
a
hardship
adds
an
additional
sanction
against
them.
this
is,
if
--
if
you're
going
to
spell
out
what
they
claim
the
original
order
would
have
said.
it
would
have
said,
you
are
ordered
to
sell
these
plants
--
we
--
no.
we
agree
that
these
plants
shall
be
sold,
but
we
agree
that
they
shall
be
sold
only
if
they
shall
be
sold
to
competitors.
that
would
be
the
way
they'd
have
to
--
to
interpret
the
consent
of
carbonic.
we
agree
that
--
that
these
plants
shall
be
sold,
but
only
if
they
are
sold
to
competitors.
well,
that's
an
--
that's
an
odd
side
of
the
condition.
ordinarily,
if
one
--
if
one
condition
to
his
consent,
he
conditions
it
by
some
ameliorating
factor.
perhaps
if
he
had
said,
“we
agree
that
these
plants
shall
be
sold,
but
--
but
not
to
competitors.”
that
would
be
a
condition
which
would
--
which
would
have
some
--
some
reason
in
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
know
that
there
were
no
other
plants
at
that
time
in
long
island.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
know
that
there
were
other
plants
appears
from
the
colloquy
and
then
in
this
--
in
this
record
that
there
were
other
plants
in
or
near
indianapolis.
mr.
john
f.
davis
long
island
city,
excuse
me.
that's
where
that
plant
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
the
liquid
carbonic
we
know
served
this
area
from
a
plant
in
belleville,
new
jersey.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
that
appears
from
the
record
what
the
competitors
in
the
new
york
area
are.
i
don't
know
that
it
does.
the
--
the
attempt
was
to
build
up
that
competition,
i
--
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
is
the
procedure
that
was
followed.
there
was
a
motion
filed
by
the
government.
it
was
filed
in
december
of
1953
for
this
modification.
note
--
a
note
is
given
to
the
--
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
submitted
some
affidavits
with
respect
to
it
and
there
was
oral
argument
before
the
court,
in
january
of
1954,
about
a
month
after
the
--
the
order
was
--
the
notice
--
the
motion
was
made.
then,
the
court
held
it
under
consideration
for
quite
a
long
time
and
came
out
with
this
--
with
an
order
for
the
injunction
rather
than
disposition
and
liquid
carbonic
said,
“we
weren't
prepared
for
that.
we
want
a
re-argument.”
and
it
was
given
a
re-argument
in
june
of
1954.
all
told
that
was
--
there
were
two
long
arguments
before
the
court.
there
was
one
deposition
affidavit
introduced
by
the
--
by
the
defendant.
there
was
a
period
of
about
eight
months
in
there.
liquid
carbonic
did
not
request
the
opportunity
to
introduce
other
evidence,
and
indeed,
it
hardly
seems
that
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
there
are
any
factual
matters
that
the
court
felt
needed
to
be
discussed.
the
court
had
the
--
the
court
interpreted
its
original
author
as
being
--
as
including
a
sensation
of
operation
of
these
plants.
it
said,
that's
what
we
intended
to
do
in
the
beginning.
we
intended
to
stop
production
from
these
plants,
but
we
intended
to
do
something
else.
we
can't
do
anything
else.
we
certainly
want
to
do
at
least
this.
we
want
to
stop
the
production.
and
so,
the
court
felt
that
there
was
no
--
probably
felt
there
was
no
need
for
any
further
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
no
request
by
the
company
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
no,
the
government
asked
for
a
sale
by
the
defendant
itself
without
the
restrictions
of
being
sold
to
competitors.
the
court
felt
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
the
court
felt
that
that
was
a
less
stringent
requirement
that
to
require
a
forced
sale
might
cause
a
hardship
to
the
defendant
and
that
the
same
object
could
be
achieved
by
just
causing
a
cessation
of
the
use,
which
would
of
course
lead
to
--
presumably
lead
to
a
sale,
but
a
sale
by
the
defendant
in
his
own
kind
and
on
his
own
terms.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
as
far
as
the
long
island
plant
is
concerned,
there's
an
indication
that
it
was
worth
more
for
real
estate
purposes
than
it
was
for
dry
ice
plant.
there
is
no
indication
as
to
the
comparison
of
value
with
respect
to
indianapolis.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
wasn't
placed
and
--
and
mr.
dwyer
told
the
court
that
the
indianapolis
plant
was
also
a
--
i
think
it
said
a
high
cost
producer
or
an
older
plant
or
something.
when
he
was
saying
that
it
was
difficult
to
sell
to
competitors,
he
was
implying
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
have
been
easier
to
sell
without
that
limitation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
so.
it's
--
it's
really
--
as
i
say,
it's
a
finished
device.
you
will
not
only
make
the
man
stop
using
it,
but
you
make
him
help
somebody
else
to
compete
with
him.
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
stringent
sort
of
thing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
certainly
is,
as
an
indication
that
it
was
meant
to
cut
down
on
the
monopoly
position
of
--
of
liquid
carbonic
in
these
areas
that
it
was
meant
to
build
up
competition
not
only
by
making
an
opening
for
competitors
but
by
aiding
them
by
giving
them
plants
in
which
they
could
produce.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
know
that
they
--
that
they
are
producing.
they
adapted
the
plant
is
--
is
still
producing
dry
--
carbon
dioxide
and
dry
ice
there.
liquid
carbonic
is
still
using
the
plant
in
that
area.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
haven't
--
i
think
this
record
shows
nothing
about
the
value
of
this
property,
either
is
going
concerned
or
for
real
estate
value
to
anybody
else
whether
it's
a
particular
value
of
the
liquid
carbonic.
i
--
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
the
trustee,
attempting
to
sell
the
thing
for
a
year
and
a
half,
if
it
had
been
a
valuable
plant
to
somebody
else
that
it
would
have
been
solved
because
that
was
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
don't
have
it
in
--
in
indianapolis,
but
there
is
some
indication
that
they
could
serve
the
area
and
that
they
were
increasing
capacity
of
--
of
production
in
another
area
so
that
they
would
still
be
able
to
serve
it,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
then,
to
--
to
summarize
where
we
came
up,
the
real
--
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
consent
of
the
parties
which
presented
to
the
--
which
was
given
to
this
original
decree,
really
comprehended.
this
was
large
enough
to
include
this
order
which
has
since
been
issued
by
the
court.
fortunately,
the
--
the
authorities
in
this
court
appeal
when
they're
clear,
the
modifications
which
are
proper
must
be
modifications
which
are
designed
to
carry
out
rather
than
to
frustrate
the
initial
purpose
of
the
decree.
that
is
what
was
specifically
stated
in
the
--
in
the
chrysler
case
and
there
was
no
statement
in
the
ford
case
that
drawn
away
from
--
from
that
legal
concept.
the
question
is
will
this
order
which
is
now
requested
carry
out
what
the
parties
intended
at
the
time
they
consented?
will
it
carry
out
the
purpose
which
the
court,
and
we
must
remember
that
this
isn't
merely
an
agreement
between
parties,
this
is
an
order
of
a
court
designed
to
carry
out
a
public
purpose
expressed
in
the
antitrust
law.
well,
the
order
which
is
required
carry
out
the
intent
which
the
court
had
in
issuing
the
initial
order.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
parties
and
the
court.
i
mean,
there's
a
tried
part
arrangement.
the
party's
consent,
but
the
party's
consent
is
of
no
effect
unless
the
court
finds
that
this
was
an
appropriate
decree
in
the
consent
decree
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right,
as
long
as
it
was
sold
at
a
fair
price.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
we
certainly
can't
assume
his
bound
to
lose.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
don't
think
we
can
make
any
assumption
one
way
or
the
other.
we
just
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
that
from
this
record,
it
appears
unlikely
that
that
is
sold
since
certainly
with
respect
to
long
island
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
even
as
to
the
other,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
well,
i
refer
again
to
the
same
section
that
mr.
dwyer
referred
to
on
page
15,
where
he
said,
“we
said
that
--first
it
speaks
to
the
long
island
plants
and
i
think
mr.
dwyer
was
interrupted
before
he
read
the
next
sentence
which
said
--we
said
that
it
was
a
high
cost
plant
to
operate,”
and
we
said
further
that
the
plant
at
indianapolis
was
not
a
modern
plant
and
that
it
likewise
would
not
be
sold
readily
to
a
purchaser
who
would
operate
it
to
co2
purposes,
which
would
indicate
to
me
that
it
is
more
valuable
for
other
purposes
than
for
co2
purposes,
to
--
to
a
purchase
anyway,
maybe
not
to
liquid
carbonic
but
to
a
purchaser.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
have
no
--
no
doubt
that
it
was.
there
was
no
question
raised
about
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
apparently,
the
government
and
the
court
believed
that
these
properties
would
be
saleable.
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
have
issued
an
order
and
spend
a
year
and
a
half
trying
to
sell
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
far
as
the
defendant
goes,
it
might
have
been
like
teaching
the
sultan's
pig
how
to
fly.
i
mean,
it
may
have
been
a
matter
of
just
postponing
the
evil
day
for
this
--
for
this
period
of
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
but
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
started
the
--
they
started
the
order
by
saying
they
shall
sell
this.
now,
that's
the
way
9
(e)
starts.
they
shall
sell
these
properties.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then,
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
give
the
additional,
first,
they
added
how
they
should
sell
it
and
they
didn't
go
back
and
say
and
if
they
can't
sell
it
this
way,
they
shall
dispose
a
bit
in
some
other
way.
and
our
question
is
did
they
--
did
they
intend
that
nothing
should
happen
that
the
--
whatever
monopoly
existed
should
continue
if
they
couldn't
sell
in
this
--
in
this
way
and
that
just
seems
to
be
an
unreasonable
construction
of
the
--
of
the
original
consent.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
view
of
the
nature
of
these
plants,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
seem
that
that
is
likely.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
the
court
felt
that
that
was
a
--
a
less
stringent
requirement
and
that
it
fulfilled
all
the
--
all
that
the
government
needed.
the
court
would
have
been
--
if
--
if
the
defendant
had
wanted
to
sell,
he
would
have
had
no
objection
to
ordering
a
sale,
but
a
force
sale
might
cause
a
loss
and
he
said,
“government
would
get
all
it
needs
if
you
don't
use
the
plants,”
so
that
's
all
we're
left
to
do.
