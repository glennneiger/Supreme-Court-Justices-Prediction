justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
assume
that
the
united
states
aimed
to
show
a
part
of
the
consequences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
presumably,
the
amended
complaint
for
texas,
any
interest
of
the
united
states
in
taking
united
states
out
of
the
case
is
a
big
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
is
so.
but
that
interest
--
that's
the
interpretation
of
this
master
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
might
be
so,
unless
his
right
affects
your
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
all
of
the
plaintiff
has
a
good
deal
of
leeway
in
shaping
what
he
is
suing
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
depends
--
that
--
that
is
so
only
through
your
affections
by
the
withdrawal
of
any
claims
against
the
indians.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
here
protecting
the
indians?
are
you
here
protecting
something
that
affects
you
by
reason
of
the
facts
that
the
indians
were
left
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
your
point
is
that
by
this
freedom,
you
let
the
indians
have
what
they
want
as
it
were
your
water
rights
are
intensified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
determines
in
your
view,
the
basis
--
on
what
basis
is
the
amount
of
water
that
the
indians
may
have
had
to
be
determined
on
your
view?
how
is
anybody
--
from
your
point
of
view,
how's
anybody
to
determine
what
water
goes
to
the
indians?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
pull
of
the
order
out
of
which
everybody
has
uncertain
performance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
who
determines
what
the
starting
point
--
what's
the
basis,
whatever
it's
called,
i'm
terribly
--
their
interest
about
these
matters
i
can
see
it
in
behalf
of
that.
there's
a
certain
quantity
of
water
that
has
to
be
divided
around.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
who
determines
first
what
that
quantity
of
water
is
to
be,
if
it's
to
be
divided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
the
compact
indicates
the
basis
on
this
divisions
to
be
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
had
been
coming
to
new
mexico
that
is
not
--
how
is
that
determined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
very
interrupting,
mr.
wilson.
you
got
a
formula
by
which
the
amount
of
water
which
varies
from
time
to
time
is
to
come
in
to
new
mexico.
that's
the
starting
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you've
got
that
as
the
--
the
--
that
which
is
the
(inaudible)
worked
if
we
use
a
bad
figure.
that's
defined
to
be
divided,
am
i
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
can
we
stop
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
this
point
are
--
are
difficult.
there
are
problems
as
between
new
mexico
and
the
indian
rights
that's
what
you're
arguing
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
to
that,
you
--
you
have
to
divide
the
water
that
comes
into
new
mexico
on
the
basis
of
the
formula
in
the
compact,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
it's
open,
did
you
do
--
get
some
formula?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
you
determine
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
said,
many
water
has
gone
around
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
is
that
--
is
that
all
to
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
is
no
scarcity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
,
when
there's
scarcity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
last
question
was
how
do
we
--
who
determined
what
the
indians
get?
what's
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
mr.
wilson,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
but
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
it's
proper
question
for
me
to
ask.
you
--
the
government
show
i
think
i
understand
that
--
well,
you
can't
say
whether
you
could
make
therein
a
problem
here,
that
texas
--
texas
has
a
problem
which
is
ought
to
be
settled
the
summary,
or
would
you
say
obviously,
he
had
no
payment
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
was
very
careful
not
to
misunderstand.
well,
that's
what
it
is.
in
fact
you
can
use
determination
by
the
court,
whether
texas
has
come
to
ignore
the
merely
and
abstract
interest
in
finding
out
what
a
contract
--
a
compact
mean.
that's
really
true
when
you
have
an
economic
problem
which
--
if
you
were
in
texas,
you
would
recognize
the
problem.
i'm
not
suggesting
now
how
it
should
be
settled,
because
that's
my
next
--
namely,
assuming
there
is
a
problem
there
that
isn't
privilege
and
assuming
there
is
a
problem,
a
serious
problem
that
you
indicate
namely,
indispensability
of
the
united
states
having
a
problem.
how
is
that
kind
of
a
concept
that's
--
i'm
not
talking
about
leaving
it.
how
is
that
kind
of
a
conflict
of
interest
if
she
didn't
state
which
from
your
point
of
view
can't
be
settled
by
this
court,
how
this
could
be
adjusted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
wouldn't
appeal
when
you
suggest
that
it's
easy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
united
states
can
come
into
this
litigation,
the
problem
we're
now
considering
wouldn't
be
easy,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
it
then
would
have
an
--
a
deficient
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is,
in
essence,
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
can't
be
adjudicated
by
this
court
because
of
the
uncertainty
that
was
left
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
followed
your
argument
this
is
a
part
of
your
statement.
i
wonder
whether
that
abstract
statement
never
would
give
rise
to
an
actual
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
is
a
natural
flow
and
whether
it
applies
to
all
these,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
--
go
ahead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
argument
is,
as
i
followed
it,
because
you
can
state
these
rights
in
abstract
legal
terms
there
couldn't
possibly
be
any
real
--
no
--
no
real
controversy
would
ever
arise,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
brief
--
but
that
brief
proposes
that
the
terms
of
the
rio
grande
compact
merely
call
for
(inaudible)
on
the
mechanical
determination.
it
is
a
document
and
so
on
--
on
ambiguity
as
to
give
rights
to
known
question
of
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
may
be
a
different,
if
the
rio
grande
compact
is
a
document
that
doesn't
have
permit
of
honest
different
rule
opinion
of
construction.
and
i
suspect
it's
the
most
unique
document
in
the
history
of
grande.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
if
they
said
what
is
honest,
but
i
mean
honest
difference
of
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
make
representation,
that
board
of
decree
and
throughout
that
decree
may
be
important
without
question
as
to
who's
right
and
who's
wrong
until
that
is
under
control.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
reminds
me
in
the
same
--
i
can
frustrate
in
her
contentions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
this
issue
been
before
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
--
why
you
may
not
want
to
ask
why
it
so
because
that
board
and
have
been
determined
that
those
are
your
clear
rights
legally,
automatically
going
to
the
compact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
they
couldn't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said,
these
couldn't
be
done
because
on
paper
you've
got
a
requirement
just
before
which
is
the
reference
as
the
usage
of
the
water.
and
i
suggest
that
the
civil
authority,
might
do
something
that
the
same
kind
of
(inaudible)
in
new
mexico
that
you
say
it
did
should
detain
consequence
of
right
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
decision
of
this
court.
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
they
may
not
have
your
view
of
the
law
for
requirements
to
be
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
quite
so
isn't
it,
a
reversion.
while
this
court
has
original
jurisdictions,
this
may
be
brought
to
the
district
court.
the
united
states
can
bring
a
suit
against
new
mexico
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
despite
that
the
united
states
may
bring
suits
against
the
decision.
i
do
not
see
what
limitation
there
is
in
the
court
--
supreme
court,
this
court
has
held
that
while
this
court
has
original
jurisdiction
on
concept
set
out
for
that
to
preclude
for
being
brought
as
a
matter
of
choice
in
the
district
court.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
the
ruling
and
i
don't
know
the
argument
in
light
of
those
instances
so
far
as
the
state
can
bring
a
suit
in
the
district
court
and
i'm
much
troubled.
i
don't
understand
in
(inaudible)
i'm
at
1952
statute.
i
don't
understand
you
because
section
--
subdivision
(c)
precludes
joining
--
joining
the
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
this
court,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
preclude
it
from
joining
in
the
district
court
and
i
meant
that
that
is
rather
a
funny
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
it
is
and
that
would
be
the
only
thing
that
i
think
it's
funny,
the
jurisdictional
act
of
--
of
congress
in
relation
with
the
division.
but
i
didn't
stand
with
that,
i
mean
you
could
bring
the
united
states
into
a
district
court
but
not
into
this
court,
isn't
that
the
way
it
looks?
