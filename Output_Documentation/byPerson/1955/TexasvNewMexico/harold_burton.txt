justice
harold
burton
mr.
wilson,
what
would
you
say
would
be
the
effect
of
this
amended
complaint
here
upon
those
particular
pueblos,
it
lifts
them
out
of
it,
as
i
understand,
or
try
to
lift
them
out
of
it,
doesn't
it?
so
the
--
your
contest
is
without
regard
to
them.
justice
harold
burton
what
is
your
statement
on
that?
justice
harold
burton
now,
can't
that
be
--
can't
be
done
by
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
harold
burton
well,
isn't
there
a
maximum
of
some
20,000
acres
involved
here
that
they
use
as
a
gauge?
justice
harold
burton
well,
mr.
edwards
--
justice
harold
burton
mr.
edwads
--
justice
harold
burton
they
can't
be
anything
in
there
with
regard
that
agreement
of
january
4th,
1955
that
in
the
appendix
1
of
--
of
the
mexico
attorney.
justice
harold
burton
there's
no
answer
to
that
anywhere.
justice
harold
burton
that's
right.
justice
harold
burton
well,
is
that
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
that
the
united
states
was
now
in
a
position
to
interfere
with
any
decree
that
is
made
here?
justice
harold
burton
one
more
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
may
i
ask,
along
that
line,
you
were
just
asked
a
moment
ago
if
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
district
court
of
--
of
new
mexico
and
you
suggested
he
can
couldn't
get
the
relief
against
the
state
of
new
mexico,
but
do
we
need
to
get
the
relief
against
the
state
as
such
if
we
can
get
the
relief
against
the
district
that
is
doing
all
the
damage
here?
