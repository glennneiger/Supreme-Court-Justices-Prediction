mr.
fred
e.
wilson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
texas
versus
the
state
of
new
mexico
on
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
which
is
pending
in
this
court.
and
the
matter
is
before
the
court
at
this
time
upon
the
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
special
master
filed
herein
on
october
14th
--
in
january,
1955.
in
order
to
understand
the
exact
issue
before
the
court,
it's
necessary
to
briefly
refer
to
what
has
transpired
heretofore
in
this
case
from
the
standpoint
of
procedure
in
the
pleadings.
the
original
complaint
of
texas
was
filed
and
the
defendants,
the
state
of
new
mexico,
and
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district,
in
response
to
the
order
to
show
cause
objected
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
for
various
reasons
among
them
being
that
the
complaint
showed
and
the
relief
sought
showed
that
the
united
states
and
the
elephant
butte
irrigation
district
were
indispensable
parties.
now,
after
that,
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
the
middle
district
answered
and
later
the
court
appointed
a
master,
honorable
john
raeburn
green.
and
kept
the
question
of
indispensability
of
parties
open,
and
referred
that
question
to
the
special
master
with
directions
that
he
have
a
hearing
and
take
evidence
if
necessary
and
report
back
to
this
court
his
conclusions
and
recommendations
as
to
the
indispensability
of
the
parties
as
alleged
in
the
pleadings.
the
master
conducted
a
hearing
in
response
to
that
order
at
santa
fe,
new
mexico
in
april,
1953.
and
a
report
of
the
--
those
hearings,
together
with
his
recommendations
and
conclusions,
were
on
the
file
to
this
court.
i
believe
that
those
hearings
embraced
four
large
volumes.
subsequent
to
that
time,
and
after
the
master
filed
his
first
report
which
was
in
1954,
both
parties,
that
is,
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant,
filed
exceptions
to
his
first
report.
the
defendants,
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
the
middle
district
accepted
only
to
that
part
of
the
master's
report
that
concluded
and
recommended
that
the
united
states
was
not
an
indispensable
party
on
account
of
many
reasons
we
urged.
and
the
texas
plaintiff
accepted
to
that
part
of
his
report
which
recommended
the
case
be
dismissed
on
account
of
the
indispensability
of
the
united
states
limited
to
a
question
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
the
rights
for
the
pueblo
indians.
those
exceptions
have
not
yet
been
ruled
upon
by
the
court,
but
the
court
referred
--
but
in
that
first
report
of
the
master,
he
suggested
that
the
state
of
texas
be
permitted
to
amend
it
to
the
prayer
of
its
complaint
further
if
it
saw
fit.
and
texas
then
filed
a
motion
in
this
court
to
amend
the
prayer
of
its
complaint
so
as
to
change
the
language
and
to
find
the
relief
to
which
she
thought
she
was
entitled.
and
that
this
court
referred
that
matter
back
to
the
master,
on
honorable
john
raeburn
green,
where
directions
that
he
determine
whether
the
motions
should
be
granted.
and
if
granted,
would
it
cure
the
defect
of
parties
which
he
had
found
to
exist?
the
master
held
a
hearing
in
st.
louis
on
this
last
reference
and
filed
his
second
report
herein
which
concludes
as
follows.
"i'm
of
the
opinion
that
the
plaintiff's
motion
for
leave
to
amend
the
prayer
of
its
complaint
should
be
granted
and
that
if
granted,
it
would
cure
for
the
time
being,
at
least,
any
defect
of
parties
herein."
now,
it's
to
that
last
report
that
the
exceptions
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
the
defendant,
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
are
directed.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
the
order
made
in
this
court,
sometime
i
believe
in
january
of
this
year,
acknowledging
receipt
of
the
last
report
of
the
master
and
stating
that
the
parties
would
have
60
days
in
which
to
file
exceptions
if
any.
we
filed
our
exceptions
within
the
60-day
period
and
a
brief
in
support
of
them.
up
until
this
time,
the
state
of
texas
has
not
responded
to
our
exceptions
in
our
file
to
the
brief
in
connection
with
it.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
the
united
states
not
on
this
particular
point.
the
united
states
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
--
filed
and
amicus
brief
heretofore.
but
the
master
suggested
that
it
might
be
desirable
that
the
solicitor
be
called
upon
to
file
another
one
in
view
to
this
last
report
but
none
has
been
filed
so
far
that
as
i
know.
so,
the
real
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
think
not.
i
think
it
was
just
in
the
master's
report
where
he
made
the
following
suggestions
but
it
was
not
communicated
insofar
as
i
know
to
the
solicitor.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
think
so
--
what
--
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
that
case
has
been
pending
here
for
--
since
1951.
the
united
stated
has
had
ample
opportunity
to
intervene
if
it
so
desires
and
the
previous
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
took
the
very
part
of
even
definite
position
that
the
united
states
is
indispensable
on
account
of
the
--
the
treaty
obligations
of
the
united
states
with
the
republic
of
mexico
and
on
account
of
the
--
the
effect
he
thought
it
would
have
on
the
rights
of
the
pueblo
indians.
and
he
mentioned
other
interests
of
the
united
states
but
did
not
develop
in
detail
as
to
how
he
thought
those
interests
would
be
affected.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that
may
have
been
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
--
to
the
prayer
as
opposed
by
texas
but
we
don't
agree
that
it
did
take
the
united
states
out
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
now,
our
exceptions
go
to
the
point
that
the
proposed
amendment
of
the
prayer,
although
the
language
is
somewhat
different,
does
not,
in
any
sense,
was
changed.
the
situation
as
it
existed
when
the
master
made
his
first
report.
and
his
first
report
was
that
on
account
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
the
rights
of
the
pueblo
indians
that
the
united
states
was
indispensable
under
the
test
the
master
applied
and
that
is
that
it
would
have
an
injurious
effect
upon
the
indians
and
would
also
leave
the
case
in
such
a
situation
as
to
be
incompatible
with
equity
and
good
conscience.
thereby
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that
was
prior
to
this
amendment
that
the
master
made
that
recommendation
applying
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
wether
it
changes
the
situation.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
and
we
contend
that
it
doesn't,
that
substantially
the
interest
will
be
the
--
the
indispensability
of
the
united
states
still
remain.
and
that
the
case
should
proceed
even
under
the
amended
prayer
without
the
presence
of
the
united
states.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
as
i
understand,
the
united
states
has
been
silent
since
this
amendment
was
proposed.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
true.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
and
that's
the
one
point
i
wanted
to
argue
here
before
i
get
on
to
the
issues
of
indispensability,
because
in
our
exceptions,
we
reiterate
and
reaffirmed
the
exceptions
we
made
to
the
former
report
where
the
master
considered,
he
divide
them
up
into
14
separate
interest
that
we
mentioned
as
showing
indispensability
of
the
united
states
in
addition
to
the
rights
of
the
indian.
and
he
found
that
none
of
those
interests
is
sufficient
to
make
the
united
states
indispensable.
and
we
--
we
--
we
reaffirmed
or
reiterate
our
claim
that
that
is
still
before
the
court
and
the
court
still
should
consider,
regardless
of
the
rights
of
the
indians
which
we
think
is
ample
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
united
state
is
indispensable
for
any
other
reason.
of
course,
if
you
determine
that
they
are
indispensable
on
account
of
rights
of
the
indians
is
not
necessary
to
consider
the
others
because
if
the
united
states
is
indispensable
for
any
reason,
this
case
should
be
dismissed
and
not
to
proceed.
but
we
do
specifically
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
last
report
of
the
master
in
reference
to
a
matter
that
transpired
in
st.
louis
when
he
had
this
motion
of
texas
to
amend
the
prayer
before
him.
at
that
time,
we
contended
that
since
the
previous
hearings,
there
had
been
some
things
transpired
which
made
it
clearer
that
the
united
states
is
indispensable
on
account
of
its
contract
with
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
in
reference
to
the
--
of
the
el
vado
reservoir
and
the
works
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district.
in
1950,
the
congress
authorized
what
is
known
as
the
middle
rio
grande
project
which
was
a
confined
--
a
combined
project
to
be
carried
out
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
corps
of
engineers.
it
was
about
a
$79
million
project.
and
the
--the
bureau
--
the
bureau
of
reclamation
ought
to
do
certain
things,
that
is
they
were
to
rehabilitate
the
works
of
the
district
including
el
vado
reservoir,
they
were
to
channelize
the
river
down
below,
i'll
refer
to
this
matter
in
a
moment,
if
i
may,
they
were
to
channelize
the
river
so
as
to
get
rid
of
the
waste
of
water
that
had
been
occasioned
by
nature,
by
degradation
of
the
river
and
the
consumption
--
non-beneficial
consumptive
use
of
water
by
plants.
and
the
bureau's
part
of
that
project
was
to
rehabilitate
the
navajo
reservoir
and
dam
and
to
rehabilitate
all
the
works
of
the
district.
and
the
original
contract
that
the
bureau
or
reclamation
made
with
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
under
the
reclamation
act
provided
that
the
district
agrees
that
it
will
convey
title
to
the
works
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
at
such
time
as
a
request
is
made
by
the
contracting
officer
who
is
the
representative
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
now,
in
our
previous
hearings
on
this
matter,
we've
argued
that
by
virtue
of
that
contract
alone,
where
the
united
states
required
the
district
to
convey
the
title
that
that
showed
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
united
states
and
the
works
of
the
district
including
navajo
dam
and
reservoir
to
show
that
any
injunction
that
might
be
granted
regulating
the
release
of
water
form
or
the
storage
of
water
in
that
reservoir
would
effect
an
interest
to
the
united
states.
but
the
hearing,
the
master
and
counsel
for
texas
took
the
position
that
this
contract
is
contingent.
it
is
an
--
the
title
hasn't
been
transferred
yet
and
it
may
never
be
because
congress
may
never
make
any
appropriations
to
carry
out
the
project.
we
didn't
think
that
was
a
sufficient
excuse
but
that's
the
way
the
matter
was
left.so
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
united
states
has,
as
shown
by
the
supplemental
report
of
the
hearing
and
before
the
master
in
st.louis,
executed
a
--
an
instrument
that
is
called
an
easement
to
all
of
the
works
of
the
district
which
i
contend
transfers
the
title
to
this
reservoir
up
here
and
while
--
to
the
united
states.
and
we
claim
that
now,
since
the
last
hearing
in
st.
louis
or
at
that
time
i
mean,
we
offered
this
instrument
and
evidence.
we
offered
another
instrument
and
evidence
that
was
in
operation
and
maintenance
contract
between
the
district
and
the
united
states
and
the
master
overruled
our
offer
for
--
and
first,
texas
objected
to
it
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
go
far
enough
but
when
we
went
into
the
whole
thing,
they
had
no
objection.
but
the
master
overruled
our
offer
on
the
ground
that
it
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
reference
to
him
over
this
one
question.
that
is
--
should
the
motion
be
granted
and
if
granted,
would
it
cure
the
defect
of
the
parties
in
the
case.
but
anyway,
as
we
--
the
master
permitted
the
two
instances
to
be
filed
and
commented
on
them
in
his
report
and
they
are
now
before
the
court.
and
we
contend
that
those
two
instruments
show
definitely
that
the
title
to
this
reservoir
that's
involved
which
the
injunction
would
operate
against
is
in
the
united
states,
its
property
of
the
united
states.
and
further,
the
operation
maintenance
contract
which
we
put
--
in
a
--
as
in
appendix
to
our
exceptions
in
the
brief,
it
appears
on
page
35
of
our
last
exceptions
in
the
brief.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
there
might
be.
i
haven't
heard
from
--
or
the
counsel
protects
this
since
it
has
been
filed
and
mr.
edwards
may
not
agree
with
us
on
the
interpretation
of
this
contract.
but
if
there
is
a
difference
that
in
my
opinion
is
just
another
reason
why
the
united
states
is
indispensable.
if
the
attorneys
and
these
parties
can't
agree
upon
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
the
united
states
made,
certainly,
the
united
states
ought
to
be
there
to
put
their
own
interpretation
upon
the
contract.
but
this
one
that
i
referred
to
on
page
37,
you
will
find
the
second
paragraph
of
that
operation
and
maintenance
agreement.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
paragraph
5
of
a
--
a
contract
that
was
entered
into
between
the
united
states
and
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
on
september
24th,
1951.
and
i
decide
to
read
only
paragraph
5
which
appears
on
page
37
of
our
brief.
it
says,
“as
required
to
permit
the
rehabilitation
and
betterment
of
the
works
to
proceed
without
undue
interruption
during
the
period
of
operation
and
maintenance
by
the
united
states
as
provided
in
article
4
of
this
amendatory
contract.
all
project
of
water,
including
water
for
indian
lands
now
served
by
the
district
facilities
as
set
forth
in
article
34,
the
basic
contract,
and
available
from
el
vado
dam
and
reservoir
shall
be
released
by
the
district
in
accordance
with
a
such
instructions
received
from
the
contracting
officer.
now,
the
contracting
officers
define
in
all
of
these
contracts
as
the
secretary
of
interior,
he
represents
the
secretary.
so,
finally,
it
is
that
--
it
has
reached
this
point
where
any
water
released
from
that
reservoir
must
be
released
under
orders
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
and
we
say
that
an
injunction
requiring
the
district
to
operate
in
a
certain
way,
to
store
water
or
release
water
is
subject
to
that
right
of
the
secretary
of
interior
to
tell
him
how
to
do
it.
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
injunction
prayed
for
by
texas
under
any
conception
of
her
rights
would
be
ineffective
and
ineffectual
because
it
would
depend
upon
the
will
of
a
person
who's
not
a
party
to
the
contract.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
before
this,
or
course
the
--
there
is
a
contract
between
the
united
states
and
district
relative
to
the
indians,
the
united
states
entered
in
a
contract
with
the
district
when
it
began
the
construction
of
this
reservoir
and
all
the
other
works
of
the
district
agreeing
to
pay
a
proportional
part
of
the
cost.
and
in
arriving
at
the
amount
of
cost
that
should
be
paid
by
the
government,
the
united
states
agreed
to
pay
something
in
excess
of
a
million
dollars
toward
the
cost
of
el
vado
reservoir
and
the
other
works
of
the
district
on
account
of
the
benefit
they
tell
it
would
be
to
the
indian
pueblos.
so,
from
that
time
on,
water
that's
stored,
if
i
may
refer
to
them
--
i
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
the
reservoir
involved
here
that
we
call
el
vado
is
up
there.
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
see,
if
not,
it's
in
the
middle
of
the
dot.
you
see,
that's
on
the
tributary
of
the
rio
grande
known
as
the
chama
and
that
reservoir
has
a
capacity
of
about
little
less
than
200,000
acre
feet.
it
was
originally
constructed
by
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
at
the
expense
of
that
district
so
that
water
could
be
stored
and
--
from
this
tributary,
the
chama
and
--
in
here
--
in
the
irrigation
season,
if
there
was
not
sufficient
water
in
the
mainstem
of
the
river,
it
would
be
released
to
irrigate
lands
within
the
district,
indian
lands
as
well
as
non-indian
lands.
now,
that
--
it
was
operated
then
or
sometime
by
the
--
the
district
and
there
was
no
determination.
nobody
knew
just
how
much
water
should
be
applied
upon
the
indian
land
but
it
was
done
by
--
by
agreement
and
negotiation
by
getting
along.
the
indians
asserted
that
they
had
rights
to
store
--
to
the
use
of
stored
water
up
here
as
well
as
rights
to
mainstem
water.
and
up
until
the
suit
was
instituted,
it
was
all
arranged
by
agreement,
not
always
with
absolute
peace,
harmony
but
at
least
they
got
along.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
indians,
this
map
--
i'm
referring
to
14
(c)
as
well
as
(inaudible)
it
is
a
map
of
the
rio
grande
basin
in
new
mexico
and
texas
above
fort
quitman.
these
black
lines
are
the
outer
delineation
of
the
basin
itself.
and
the
--
the
rio
grande
rises
up
in
the
southwestern
colorado,
flows
through
to
san
luis
valley
but
was
not
shown
on
here
and
when
it
gets
--
went
down
to
the
new
mexico
or
colorado
line
at
lobatos
station
as
the
main
illustration
station
there,
that's
where
the
water
is
measured
that
comes
into
new
mexico.
the
river
continues
on
down
by
the
taos,
an
indian
reservation,
by
espańola.
this
is
santa
fe
comes
run
down
through
albuquerque
and
come
down
to
the
el
paso
and
to
fort
quitman.
we
usually
regard
the
rio
grande
as
two
references
that
is
on
its
source
to
fort
quitman,
texas.
and
from
thereon,
it
flows
into
the
gulf
and
we
regard
that
as
the
lower
rio
grande
which
is
not
involved
in
the
suit.
now,
the
--
the
mainstem
of
the
river,
as
i
say,
goes
down
this
way
and
the
green
part,
you
see,
on
there
is
irrigated
land.
now,
the
map
shows
the
indian
reservations
in
pink,
i
doubt
that
you
can
see
it
but
here's
the
taos.
that
shows
a
--
an
area
there
in
pink
which
is
the
taos
indian
reservation.
they
get
their
water
from
the
tributaries
of
the
rio
grande
and
come
down
the
river
further,
we
come
to
--
to
santa
ana,
a
small
reservation
right
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
to
nambe,
they're
all
outside
of
the
middle
district.
now,
and
when
you
get
to
the
--
the
middle
district
is
not
shown
very
clearly
on
this
map
but
this
arrow
here
points
to
the
northern
boundary
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
and
this
area
here
to
the
southern
boundary.
and
that
area
on
--
on
the
rio
grande
is
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district.
now,
within
that
area,
there
are
six
indian
pueblos
who
used
the
works
of
the
district
in
order
to
apply
water
to
their
land.
now,
those
--
those
indian
pueblos
by
name,
is
cochiti
which
is
the
(inaudible)
the
pink
here
shows
that
they
have
a
--
a
reservation.
and
the
--
come
on
down
from
cochiti,
there's
santo
domingo,
a
rather
large
pueblo
with
--
by
an
area
of
reservation
land
was
to
court
the
members
that
the
titles
to
this
land
is
in
the
pueblo
indians
and
the
united
states
as
their
guardian
has
some
interest
in
it,
of
course.
the
question
published
titles
in
the
united
states
for
the
indians
is
not
important
here.
then
coming
on
down
from
santo
domingo,
we
have
the
san
felipe
indians,
north
of
bernalillo.
and,
the
sandia,
another
reservation
right
on
the
river
between
albuquerque
and
santa
fe.
and
isleta,
one
of
the
large
pueblos
down
south
of
albuquerque
has
a
large
area
on
both
sides
of
the
river
and
that
is
the
southern
most
pueblo
within
the
district.
there
are
other
districts
like
--
there
are
reservations
like
laguna
and
acoma
which
get
water
from
tributaries
of
the
rio
grande
but
are
not
within
the
middle
district.
and
the
jemez
is
another
reservation
that
gets
the
water
from
tributaries
and
this
jemez
river
or
--
is
one
upon
which
the
united
states
is
now
erecting
a
flood
control
reservoir
which
is
then
completed.
the
united
states
is
about
to
build
another
reservoir
or
chamita
up
here
on
the
chama
for
flood
control
purposes.
we
contend
that
those
interests
of
the
united
states
make
it
necessary
that
should
be
a
party
because
those
reservoirs
think
the
operators
of
this
flood
control
reservoirs
if
--
has
texas
said.
all
reservoirs
must
be
operated
as
required
by
the
middle
rio
grande
--
by
--
by
the
rio
grande
compact
because
that
compact
would
not
permit
the
release
of
water
for
flood
control
purposes
when
there's
less
than
400,000
acre
feet
in
project
storage
in
elephant
butte
or
when
in
january
of
any
year
there's
less
than
600,000.
the
compact
does
--
doesn't
contemplate
or
say
anything
about
flood
control.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
yes.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
originally,
texas
in
her
complaint
and
in
our
argument,
took
the
position
that
el
vado
would
be
operated
and
to
inform
they
were
in
an
injunction
or
without
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
indians
because
they
have
no
storage
rights
at
all
in
el
vado.
texas
then
took
the
position
that
the
only
right
that
the
indians
have
is
to
take
water
out
of
the
mainstem
of
the
river
and
then
only
for
8000
and
some
other
acres
of
land.
that's
all
the
rights
texas
conceded
at
that
time
to
indians.
but
as
the
case
progressed,
and
she
made
three
efforts
to
change
the
language
refer
one
for
beginning
of
the
hearings,
another
for
end
of
the
hearings,
and
this
motion
to
amend
which
is
now
before
the
court.
and
that
the
motion
to
amend
took
her
to
the
other
extreme
and
she
knew
that
the
court
--
if
the
court
had
to
determine
whether
the
indians
have
storage
rights
or
what
is
the
extent
of
the
indian
rights
in
quantity
of
water
that
the
united
states
weren't
bound
to
be
there.
so,
in
order
to
avoid
that
consequence,
texas
says,
now
that
give
us
an
injunction
as
to
the
operation
of
el
vado
in
controlling
their
release
and
storage
of
water
in
it
and
say
that
it's
without
restriction
as
to
indian
lands.
any
injunction
that's
rendered
in
this
court
shall
not
have
--
be
any
restriction
upon
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
use
stored
water
or
mainstem
water.
now
my
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
my
conception
to
that
is,
your
honor,
that
in
any
case
where
you
raised
a
question
of
indispensability,
the
plaintiff
can
come
in
and
say,
“well,
that
party
of
course
in
indispensable
but
that
just
don't
litigate
about
his
rights
at
all.
that's
what
leave
them
out
the
picture.”
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
yes.
i
think
the
plaintiff
has
some
leeway
but
i
don't
agree
if
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
can
look
forward
and
determine
whether
or
not
this
relief
would
have
any
effect
upon
the
indians
or
not.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
we
are
--
we
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
we
are
protecting
the
--
the
state
of
new
mexico
on
the
district
from
any
injunction
that
will
require
a
water
master
to
release
water
to
us
for
our
lands
and
--
well
that
master
will
have
no
idea
how
much
of
any
water
could
--
could
put
on
the
indian
land.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
in
other
words,
they
say
that
the
latter
part
of
the
equity
rule
that
we
talked
about,
i
will
leave
the
case
in
such
a
condition
as
to
be
inconsistent
with
equity
in
good
conscience.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
no.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
but
we
don't
know
their
rights
are.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
we
think
that
the
united
states
is
indispensable
when
any
master
opponent
by
this
court
undertakes
to
do
what
this
decree
says.
it
says,
“release
water,
major
water,
release
and
allocate
it
to
all
the
lands
in
the
middle
valley
including
indian
lands
in
certain
priorities.”
but
the
master
wouldn't
know
how
much
water
should
release
to
the
indian
lands.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
oh,
he
doesn't
know
what
they
are.
they're
never
been
determined.
this
record
is
full
of
the
proposition
that
the
indian
rights
--
the
extent
of
them
has
never
been
defended.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
there
is
20,000
acres
comes
in
by
virtue
of
the
contract
between
the
united
states
and
the
middle
district.
when
the
district
was
getting
ready
to
build
el
--
el
vado
and
all
the
works,
the
united
states
made
a
survey
and
determined
that
8000
acres
of
all
land
would
be
benefited
by
the
works
of
the
district.
and
an
additional
11,000
acres
would
also
be
benefited
by
the
works
of
the
district.
and
therefore,
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
united
states
contributed
a
million
dollars
to
the
workers.
but,
there
was
nothing
in
that
contract,
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
that
authorized
that
contract
that
enabled
anybody
to
know
that
quality
of
water
that
the
indians
require
on
their
lands.
and
i
contend
that
nobody
couldn't
have
master
a
reservoir
or
an
irrigation
--
set
of
works
and
facilities
and
release
it
to
this
man
and
that
man
until
their
rights
have
been
determined
to
a
quantity
of
water.
if
a
master
follows
this
decree,
before
the
decree,
it
should
be
released,
water
here,
it
comes
on
down
to
courts
appeal.
there
is
an
indians
debts
that
takes
all
of
it.
there
are
white
people
who
they
want
attention
too.
nobody
has
ever
determined
whether
the
indians
require
one
acre
foot,
two
acre
feet,
five
acre
feet,
or
10
acre
feet
of
diversion
per
year.
and
i
don't
know
if
irrigations
is
--
or
no
regulation
or
reservoir
that
can
be
operated
by
an
agent
of
this
court
until
this
court
has
told
him
the
quantity
of
water
that
all
the
water
users
are
required
to
--
are
entitled
to.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
the
indians
and
the
other
users
all
over
were
there
together
must
come
in
to
a
court.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
right.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
nobody
can
determine
unless
it's
by
agreement.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
contact
--
compact
doesn't
say
a
thing
about
the
relative
rights
of
the
parties
in
the
three
areas
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
all
right.
the
compact,
your
honor,
regulates
the
rio
grande
unless
they're
really
showed
on
the
map.
it
requires
the
state
of
colorado
to
permit
before
to
cross
the
new
mexico
state
line
a
certain
amount,
i
say
certain,
it's
certain
in
this
extent.
the
contact
does
inform
depending
on
certain
relationships
of
tributary
as
that
in
colorado.
and
when
they
are
compiled
with
their
farmer
why
its
possible
to
measure
the
quantity
of
water
that
colorado
must
let
come
in
to
new
mexico.
but
when
it
comes
to
new
mexico
and
texas
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
as
far
as
colorado
is
concerned.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
and
that's
to
measure
that
space
more.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
you
could
use
that
as
a
possible
division
between
colorado
and
new
mexico.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
but
i'm
--
i'm
making
a
point
that
that's
not
true
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned.
the
compact
doesn't
do
that
same
thing,
insofar
as
texas
and
new
mexico
are
concerned.
the
compact
provides
that
it
sets
up
years
after
that
on
the
map.
that's
not
above
the
“to
the
reservation
in
the
middle
district”.
the
engineers
in
making
this
formula
that
appears
in
the
compact,
thought
they
have
discovered
a
relationship
in
any
amount
of
water
that
goes
in
the
rio
grande
as
in
otowi
and
the
amount
at
the
same
time
that
would
reach
san
marcial,
here.
now,
san
marcial
is
up
above
elephant
butte
reservoir
(inaudible)
reservoirs
down
here.
now,
that
relationship,
the
farmers
set
out
in
the
compact
and
it
says
in
effect
when
there
is
a
certain
quantity
of
water
took
at
the
--
that
relationship
with
the
farmers
would
acquire
a
certain
amount
to
pass
san
marcial.
now,
that's
based
on
what
the
engineers
conceived
to
be
the
way
of
the
river
performed
for
40
years
in
the
party.
and
they
assume
it
would
continue
to
perform
that
way
in
the
future.
so,
the
new
mexico
obligates
and
that
is
to
deliver
into
the
rio
grande
river
at
san
marcial
that
quantity
of
water
set
up
in
a
farm.
now,
below
san
marcial,
if
the
court
please,
is
the
elephant
butte
reservoirs
and
the
elephant
butte
irrigation
district
in
new
mexico
which
irrigates
about
85,000
acres
of
land
and
gets
its
water
from
elephant
butte.
the
texas
boundary
is
down
here,
probably
150
miles,
from
san
marcial
and
texas
gets
her
water
from
the
elephant
butte
reservoir
by
contract
with
the
united
states.
and
i
say
that
the
compact
cannot
be
construed
as
an
allocation
of
water
between
texas
and
new
mexico
as
it
was
in
the
member
in
the
--
in
the
hinderlider
case
on
the
la
plata.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
we
--
we
have
to
--
well,
suppose,
and
prior
with
the
compact
and
--
when
there's
so
much
water
at
otowi,
we're
supposed
to
see
to
it
that
so
much
water
reaches
san
marcial.
now,
in
order
to
--
to
comply
with
that,
we
take
the
position
and
it's
an
issue
in
this
case
that
the
compact
never
intended
that
if
the
--
the
amount
set
up
and
the
farmer
did
not
reach
san
marcial
that
that
created
a
relationship
of
debt
or
credit
between
texas
and
new
mexico
because
that
farmer
requires
that
it'd
be
computed
every
calendar
year
--
at
the
end
of
the
calendar
year.
and
then
it
provides
that
when
there
is
a
spill
in
elephant
butte,
credits
intended
to
wipe
it
out.
so,
our
position
is
that
the
few
intent
of
the
compact
was
not
to
require
new
mexico
under
in
all
circumstances
to
see
that
a
certain
quantity
of
water
reached
san
marcial
but
that
present
rights
were
to
be
protected.
the
record
shows
that
when
this
formula
were
set
up
by
the
engineers,
it
was
suppose
to
protect
present
rights
and
it
recognized
that
the
united
states
was
not
bound
by
anything
that
was
in
it.
so,
we
say
that
the
indian
rights
and
the
present
uses
at
the
time
the
compact
was
negotiated
in
1929,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
debts
and
credits,
the
base
should
be
deflected
from
the
amount
of
water
that
goes
to
san
marcial.
otherwise,
new
mexico
in
the
middle
area
there
is
charged,
for
not
only
with
the
water
she
uses
on
land
but
with
non-beneficial
uses,
an
indian
use.
and
we
submit
that
that
was
not
the
intent
of
the
compact
and
that
would
be
an
issue
in
the
case
that's
got
to
be
determined.
i
don't
want
to
exceed
my
time.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
the
amended
contract.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
no.
there's
nothing
mentioned
about
that
in
any
of
the
contracts
of
united
states.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
there
is
a
--
a
statute
that
you
may
be
thinking
about
when
the
--
this
middle
rio
grande
project
would
authorized
that
is
to
build
those
flood
control
reservoirs
or
rehabilitate
the
district.
there
was
a
--
a
provision
in
that
statute
which
said
that
the
projects
should
be
operated
in
conformity
with
the
rio
grande
compact.
but
we
submit
that
the
united
states
ought
to
be
here
to
be
interpret
those
statutes
and
those
contracts
as
she
may.
and
that
her
rights
will
be
affected
if
a
decree
of
this
kind
is
rendered.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
we
don't
believe
that
you
can
dispense
well
an
indispensable
party
by
just
saying
we
won't
litigate
about
his
rights
at
all
because
that
party
will
be
litigating
with
you
and
we
can't
possibly
perform
this
injunction
without
being
subjected
to
another
suit
by
the
united
states
and
the
indians.
now,
those
rights
are
determined.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
no.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
was
talking
about
the
decree
of
the
court,
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
about
how
the
--
how
much
land,
how
much
water
shall
be
put
on
in
--
in
land
or
anybody
else's
land.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
it
left
to
the
secretary
of
interior
and
by
virtue
of
a
statute
on
a
contract
to
determine
the
priorities
of
--
two
classes
of
indian
lands.
that
is
the
--
the
--
the
secretary
of
interior
put
in
the
contract
that
since
the
indians
have
been
irrigating
8000
acres
of
land
from
time
immemorial
that
they
shouldn't
be
charged
that
that
land
shouldn't
be
charged
of
any
expenses
of
operating
the
district
but
that
as
to
20
--
11,000
acres
of
additional
land
that
that
should
be
charged
to
the
indians
so
that
does
establish
a
priority
and
priority
with
the
right
to
use
water
but
it
don't
say
how
much.
and
this
decree
that
texas
seeks
the
--
her
second
statement,
she
put
in
there
language
that
would
enable
the
irrigation
engineer
in
new
mexico
to
determine
the
amount
of
water
that
should
be
given
to
the
indians.
the
master
said
that
doesn't
obviate
the
necessity
of
the
presence
of
the
united
states
because
it's
obvious
that
if
you
can't
let
the
area
irrigation
engineer
determine
the
quantity
or
amount
of
water,
and
anyway
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
defendants.
that
was
the
masters
first
conclusion.
and
the
--
the
new
amendment,
however,
leaves
out
the
word
“amount”
and
says
the
water
shouldn't
just
be
without
restriction
and
that
would
enable
the
water
master
to
--
he
wouldn't
know
how
much
water
to
deliver
to
the
indians
and
how
much
to
deliver
to
their
neighbors.
and
it
would
start
a
controversy
that
will
be
worse
than
this
one.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
they
are
part
of
the
conservancy
district
and
they
have
a
representation
in
--
it's
in
the
meeting
into
that
board
and
it's
worked
out
by
agreement.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
no.
the
secretary
doesn't
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
--
determine
any
amount.
there's
nobody
who
can
determine
the
amount
per
acre
feet
that
the
indians
are
titled
to
--
or
this
has
never
been
determined.
it's
open.
and
until
that
is
determined,
i
insist
that
no
decree
can
be
entered
in
this
case.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
yes.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
they
have
their
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
it's
--
all
we
might
say
it's
a
free
for
all.
the
water
closed
down
the
mainstem.
their
diversion
dams
are
built
here.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
if
there's
plenty
of
water,
there's
no
trouble.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
no.
that's
never
--
that
is
when
the
compact
was
negotiated
why
--
in
1941,
there
often
be
a
spill.
everything
was
lovely
for
several
years.
but
this
draft
started,
your
honor,
and
it's
--
in
a
scarcity
of
water,
you've
got
to
know
how
much
each
one
is
entitled.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
but
when
there
is
no
scarcity,
why
is
there
no
trouble.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
when
there
is
a
scarcity?
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
the
indians
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
the
answer
is
that
the
indians
appealed
to
the
conservancy
district
and
tell
them
what
their
needs
are
that
they
haven't
had
any
water
since
june
and
they'll
need
some
in
august
and
it's
worked
up
by
mutual
agreement
without
regard
to
legal
rights.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
we
claim
that
the
federal
government
has
acquired
title
to
all
the
works
of
the
district
including
el
vado
reservoir.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
it
wouldn't
if
this
court
is
going
to
take
charge
of
it
and
issue
an
injunction.
the
--
this
court
will
tell
the
master
how
to
operate
el
vado
and
that's
what
we're
saying,
the
united
states
ought
to
be
here
if
this
court
is
going
to
make
an
injunctive
order
telling
the
district
must
stay
in
new
mexico
on
how
to
operate.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
oh,
that
would
put
the
--
the
(inaudible)
indians
in
new
mexico
at
the
mercy
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
he
not
bound
by
this
case.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
not
now,
no.
we
can
assert
our
rights
now,
and
be
fair
and
try
to
divide
it
properly
in
days
of
scarcity.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
what
--
we
take
this
position,
we
don't
know
what
the
indians
rights
are.
new
mexico
says
the
indians
claim
these
rights.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
under
the
constitution
of
the
new
mexico
which
doesn't
apply
to
the
indians
and
all
the
doctrine
appropriation.
certainly,
the
first
in
time
is
prior
and
it's
historically
true
that
the
indians
have
been
irrigating
that
land
there
for
300
years.
and
to
that
extent,
they
are
part.
but
what
the
result
would
be
we
if
got
to
litigate
their
legal
rights.
if
this
case
goes
on,
that's
what's
going
to
have
to
happen.
and
in
my
opinion,
it's
not
in
the
interest
of
the
indians
to
have
that
happen.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i'll
answer
that
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i'll
try
to
answer
that
this
way,
your
honor,
that
texas
seeks
to
have
this
court
adjudicate
on
the
meaning
and
interpretation
of
the
compact
upon
which
she
bases
certain
rights.
now,
then,
the
question
as
i
understand
it
is
--
is
that
a
question
of
such
burning
importance
as
to
make
it
necessary
for
a
court
to
adjudicate.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
now,
i'll
answer
that
as
briefly
as
i
can.
it
would
be
settled
by
negotiation
and
cooperation
just
as
the
original
compact
of
negotiation.
this
court
has
said
many
times
and
admonished
the
states
that
it
wouldn't
be
much
better
for
them
to
make
a
compact,
that
they
could
appeal
(inaudible)
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
but
i
say
that
you've
got
to
be
friendly
and
cooperative
if
you
make
a
compact.
then
when
you
make
a
compact,
you
still
got
to
be
friendly
and
cooperative
in
order
to
make
that
compact
work.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
if
it
is
that
that
is
--
if
texas
prevails,
the
compact
has
got
to
be
interpreted
and
we
don't
interpret
it
the
same
way.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
if
the
united
states
were
a
part
of
this
case,
it
could
litigated.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
and
in
decree
the
court
in
there
would
have
some
finality
and
some
effect.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
yes.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
i
don't
know
it's
just
what
part
of
the
problems
to
be
solved,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
well,
her
rights
might
be
settled
theoretically.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
and
we
suggested
in
our
original
briefs
that
the
--
there
is
a
remedy,
not
in
this
court,
but
there
is
a
remedy
on
public
law
495
passed
by
the
second
congress
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
second
session.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
it
was
mentioned
in
our
original
brief
on
indispensability
of
parties
and
it's
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief
as
public
law
495
at
second
congress
session.
we
suggested
that
while
texas
couldn't
sue
under
that
in
this
court,
the
improvement
district
down
there
in
texas
required
the
way,
is
the
only
interest
texas
has
in
the
whole
basin
irrigate
65,000
acre
feet
of
water.
that
district
or
any
citizen
of
texas
in
the
state
of
texas
could
file
a
suit
in
the
new
mexico
state
courts
or
in
the
federal
courts
in
new
mexico
to
adjudicate
water
rights
on
that
system.
and
this
public
law
says
that
in
such
a
case,
the
united
states
consents
to
be
sued
and
they
could
be
settled
that
way.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
it's
required
here
in
our
--
in
our
reply
brief
here
on
page
20.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
this
is
the
reply
brief
of
the
defendants
on
the
question
of
indispensability
of
parties
and
i
don't
have
the
date
when
it
was
filed.
it
was
filed
probably
two
years
ago.
and
before
i
close,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
--
in
support
of
the
argument
i
was
making
about
the
title
of
el
vado
being
in
the
united
states.
now,
the
united
states
having
control
of
the
operation
and
maintenance,
that
is
the
release
of
water,
we
referred
in
our
briefs
to
the
case
of
becker.
that
is
the
truth
or
consequences
versus
becker
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit.
anyway,
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
that
case
of
truth
or
consequences
against
becker
and
the
el
paso
improvement
district
no.
1
comprising
(inaudible)
county.
both
of
those
cases
hold
that
where
the
united
states
is
operating
a
reservoir
which
it
has
title
that
the
united
states
is
then
an
indispensable
party
that
the
court
will
not
then
issue
an
injunction
against
a
mere
agent.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
believe
in
both
of
them.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
that's
right.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
and
i
think
that's
absolutely
conclusive.
mr.
fred
e.
wilson
if
the
court
please,
i
--
there's
two
matters
i
want
brief
or
to
refer
to
in
connection
with
this
case.
one,
ominously
contract
that
we
have
been
discussing
here
today
and
the
other
is
the
effect
of
the
proposed
amended
decree
in
relation
to
that
contract
and
its
connection
with
the
parties
that
are
materially
interested
in
the
situation
here.
now,
under
the
prior
prime
contract
of
1951,
it
is
provided
in
there
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
require
the
conveyance
of
the
property
owned
by
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
as
security
for
the
loan
and
reimbursable
charge
that
the
district
is
obligated
to
pay
--
repay
on
this
construction
that
at
anytime,
during
the
course
of
that
contractual
relation,
the
government
may
refer
that
operation
maintenance
contract
back
to
the
district
to
operate
and
maintain
the
district
works
under
the
supervision
of
the
united
states.
and
at
certain
intervals,
the
government
may
take
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
district
works
away
from
the
district
and
operate
and
maintain
the
district
itself.
now,
based
upon
that
provision
of
the
contract,
an
amendatory
contract
was
entered
into
on
the
first
day
of
february
of
this
year,
which
provided
that
the
government
would
take
over
and
operate
and
maintain
the
works
of
the
district
except
el
vado
reservoir.
and
as
to
that,
we
have
construed
that
contract
and
i
think
the
bureau
of
reclamation
boys
go
along
with
me
on
that
that
we,
as
the
district
now,
is
operating
and
maintaining
el
vado
reservoir
as
the
agent
for
the
united
states
government
that
we
can't
release
any
water
whatsoever
from
the
reservoir
without
instructions
from
the
contracting
officer,
who
is
the
district
official,
for
the
district
in
which
this
construction
is
being
carried
on.
now,
with
that
in
view,
just
briefly
i
call
attention
to
paragraph
(3)
of
the
amended
complaint
and
see
just
how
that
could
operate
in
view
of
the
circumstances
that
i
have
explained.
paragraph
(3),
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
the
other
defendants
herein
to
be
required
subject
to
the
provisions
of
paragraph
(4)
hereof
to
release
water
from
storage
reservoirs
constructed
after
1929
in
new
mexico
above
san
mateo,
in
the
amounts
and
under
the
conditions
set
forth
in
article
viii
of
the
rio
grande
compact.
whenever
at
the
beginning
of
any
year,
the
quantity
of
usable
water
in
projects
stored
is
less
than
600,000
acre-feet
and
the
commissioner
for
texas
during
the
month
of
january
in
such
year
demand
such
a
release.
now,
the
first
of
this
year,
the
commissioner
from
the
state
of
new
mexico
says
there's
less
than
600,000
acre-feet
in
elephant
butte
reservoir,
you
got
50,000
acre-feet
in
storage
in
el
vado.
now,
between
the
first
day
of
january
of
1955
and
the
third
day
april
1956,
i
say,
"you
release
all
the
water
you
have
in
storage."
the
injunction
is
directed
against
us.
the
court
tells
us
to
release
that.
the
party
in
charge
over
the
release
of
the
water
is
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
the
united
states.
now,
we
have
that
situation,
so
we
find
that
the
authorities
indicate
that
the
court
would
not
enter
a
decree
where
it's
advocacy
depends
upon
the
will
of
a
third
party
of
an
--
or
any
inferior
department
of
the
government
and
that
is
the
way
we
look
at
it
in
this
case.
now,
just
one
more
thing
and
then
i'm
through
because
i
think
my
time
is
up
but
mr.
edwards
has
gone
into
great
extent
explaining
the
facts
in
this
case
and
how
easy
it
will
be
to
construe
this
compact
under
the
flood
control
act
because
he
said
that's
all
can
be
done.
now,
that
is
the
very
question
that's
been
before
this
court
all
the
time
is
the
dispute
of
the
parties
as
to
what
the
compact
means.
now,
here's
what
mr.
edwards
says
it
means
and
you
listened
to
what
he
says.
therefore,
when
the
amount
of
water
not
exceeding
a
100,000
acre-feet
will
pass
the
gaging
station
that
other
way,
which
is
the
upper
most
compact
gaging
station
in
the
rio
grande,
the
state
in
new
mexico
is
not
obligated
to
deliver
any
water
was
measured
into
elephant
butte
reservoir,
but
when
900,000
acre-feet
is
measured
out
of
way,
then
texas
claims
648,000
acre-feet
of
water.
now,
all
through
the
years,
the
indent
share
of
the
water
of
the
rio
grande
has
been
charged
up
against
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
show
that
we
are
in
debt
to
texas
today
if
we
were
given
credit
for
the
indent
usage,
then
texas
with
the
less
water
under
this
compact.
