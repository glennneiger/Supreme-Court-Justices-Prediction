mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
somewhat
surprised
that
the
statement
made
by
judge
wilson
that
his
idea
of
a
solution
of
this
case
should
be
that
the
state
should
enter
into
an
agreement
or
enter
into
a
compact.
the
disagreement
between
texas
and
new
mexico
over
water
rights
arose
good
many
years
ago
and
resulted
in
litigation
in
this
court
whereby
texas
sought
to
secure
a
decree
allocating
the
waters
of
the
rio
grande.
however,
while
hearings
were
being
held
before
a
special
master,
the
two
states
did
get
together
and
did
work
out
a
compact
and
then
did
some
of
the
compact
and
that
is
a
compact
which
is
before
this
court
here
today
which
texas
says
that
new
mexico
will
flee
and
deliberately
violate
it.
what
good
does
it
do
to
make
a
compact
if
you
can't
get
the
other
state
to
live
up
to
it?
now,
it's
a
matter
of
record
here
just
what
did
transpire
with
reference
to
a
precipitation
of
this
case.
just
a
few
months
before
the
prayer
and
the
suit
was
filed,
the
new
--
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district,
on
may
26th,
1951,
actually
got
together
and
passed
a
resolution
which
reads
as
follows,
whereas
the
terms
of
the
rio
grande
compact
having
been
discussed
and
the
members
of
the
board
being
familiar
therewith
and
whereas
the
board
recognizes
the
responsibility
of
the
state
engineer
under
the
rio
grande
compact
but
because
of
the
shortage
of
water
and
dire
necessity
of
the
people
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district.
now,
therefore,
be
it
resolved
that
the
policy
of
the
board
is
to
take
care
of
the
need
of
the
farmers
to
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
insofar
as
it's
possible
with
the
limited
supply
of
water
available.
that
is
the
boldest
statement
i
think
that
has
ever
come
to
my
attention
of
a
deliberate
notice
that
the
party
was
going
to
violate
a
contract
willfully
and
knowingly.
now,
that
is
--
is
why
we're
here
in
court
now
is
to
try
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
this
rio
grande
compact
of
1938.
that
compact
in
its
provisions,
particularly
articles
6,
7
and
8
provided
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
should
not
increase
its
debits
of
water
which
was
--
had
a
limit
of
200,000
acre
feet
on
there
until
it
had
been
reduced
below
that
amount
and
that
--
that
they
shouldn't
increase
storage
in
reservoirs
a
built
after
1929
whenever
there
was
less
than
400,000
acre
feet
of
usable
water
and
project
storage,
and
that
when
requested
by
the
rio
grande
compact
commissioner
for
texas
in
january
of
each
year
that
they
would
release
water
from
project
storage
at
the
greatest
rate
practicable,
whenever
there
was,
at
the
beginning
of
any
year,
a
quantity
of
water
less
than
600,000
acre
feet
and
that
new
mexico
should
release
that
stored
water
at
such
a
rate
as
would
keep
the
amount
in
project
storage
up
to
600,000
acre
feet
at
the
end
of
april.
now,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
it
is
the
only
tribunal
before
which
the
state
of
texas
may
obtain
readdress.
judge
wilson
has
cited
that
act
that
was
passed
by
congress
in
1952
authorizing
suits
against
the
united
states
for
the
allocation
or
division
of
waters
of
the
river
or
river
system
or
for
the
administration
of
that
water
but
it
does
not
authorize
one
state
to
sue
another
state
in
any
court.
there
is
no
authority
for
that
except
the
acts
of
congress
and
the
constitution
which
test
that
in
this
tribunal
here
now.
now,
in
considering
the
question
of
whether
the
amended
prayer
of
texas
should
be
granted.
i
think
it's
necessary
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
background
which
is
rather
complicated.
in
this
connection,
concerning
the
briefs,
as
mr.
wilson
has
mentioned,
he
said
the
texas
had
filed
no
briefs
in
the
case.
i
would
like
to
call
the
courts
attention
that
there
have
been
21
printed
documents
filed
here
to
this
date
exclusive
of
the
record
which
consist
of
some
1300
pages,
and
that
new
mexico,
in
the
beginning,
advanced
16
reasons
as
to
why
they
were
indispensable
parties
in
this
case.
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
texas
convinced
the
special
master
that
new
mexico
was
wrong
on
15
and
a
half
of
them,
and
decided
on
one
half
of
those
points
that
is
the
indians
within
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
as
being
an
adequate
reason
for
holding
the
united
states
to
be
an
indispensable
party.
he,
therefore,
recommended
a
dismissal
of
the
case
unless
texas
amended
the
prayer
in
order
to
avoid
that
question
or
unless
the
united
states
intervened.
frankly,
texas
didn't
agree
with
the
special
master
on
that
point.
we
thought
that
the
prayer
we
had
originally
was
adequate.
it
is
never
been
our
conception
that
the
right
of
a
party
to
stay
in
court
depended
on
his
ability
exactly
to
ask
for
the
exact
relief
to
which
he
was
entitled.
in
other
words,
if
we
asked
for
a
little
more
than
he
was
entitled
to
or
if
he
asked
for
a
little
less
than
he
was
entitled
to,
it
shouldn't
be
a
reason
for
his
not
being
able
to
stay
in
court.
it
--
it's
always
been
our
understanding
that
a
party's
entitled
to
their
belief
that
the
facts
give
him
and
54
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
practice
and
procedure
provides
that
every
judgment
that's
rendered
shall
award
to
the
applicant
the
relief
to
which
he
is
entitled
under
the
facts
without
the
necessity
of
that
being
set
forth
specifically
in
his
prayer
and
not
only
that
but
we
had
a
prayer
for
general
relief
to
begin
with
and
still
have
it.
now,
the
question
presented
to
the
court
at
this
time
is
whether
or
not
the
amendment
to
the
prayer
should
be
permitted
and
whether,
if
permitted,
it
eliminates
the
question
of
indispensability
of
the
indians
within
the
confines
or
exterior
boundaries
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district.
and
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
in
order
to
give
a
proper
consideration
to
that
particular
question,
it
is
necessary
to
go
into
the
facts
and
consider
the
indian
rights
as
related
to
other
occurrences
which
have
taken
place
on
them
to
the
present
time.
now,
as
judge
wilson
has
said,
it
is
quite
true
that
the
indians
were
such
--
awaited
along
the
banks
of
the
rio
grande
for
many
hundreds
of
years.
i
believe
it's
stipulated
that
they
had
been
there
900
years.
they
were
there
anyway
when
the
conquistador
has
came
up
from
mexico
and
touched
the
rio
grande
little
below
el
paso
and
worked
on
at
the
river
and
finally
in
the
colorado.
they
found
the
mexicans
there
has
been
irrigating
their
lands
by
crude
methods
and
by
means
of
direct
diversion
from
the
rio
grande.
it
was
the
indians
that
thought
the
conquistador
as
how
to
irrigate
and
not
the
other
way
around.
the
indians
have
known
how
to
do
it
for
a
long,
long
time
and
they
still
know.
now,
that
being
true,
the
indians
had
unquestionably,
a
prior
right
and
a
superior
right
to
texas
and
everybody
else
as
far
as
their
appropriations
of
water
from
the
rio
grande
at
that
time
were
concerned.
that
brings
up
the
question
of
what
is
a
priority.
now,
under
--
under
present
statutes
in
many
of
the
western
states,
that
is
fixed
by
the
acts
of
the
legislature
as
--
as
a
method
or
means
by
which
a
--
a
landowner
boarding
on
the
river
can
secure
water
rights.
he
can
file
his
application
asking
for
the
right
to
appropriate
1000
acre
feet
per
year
for
so
many
acres
of
land.
well,
in
that
case,
then
of
course,
there's
no
question
about
the
amount
that
that
--
the
--
the
applicant
is
entitled
to
receive.
and
when
he
has
received
that
amount,
he's
not
entitled
to
receive
anymore,
that
ends
it.
but
in
the
indian
situation
here,
you
have
something
entirely
different.
their
historical
right
was
not
regulated
by
a
statute
but
on
the
facts
in
the
case
and
on
their
usages
which
have
been
recognized
by
the
united
states
and
new
mexico
and
everybody
else.
as
giving
them
a
full
and
complete
right
to
the
use
of
the
natural
flow
of
the
river
to
the
extent
that
it
is
reasonably
necessary
for
the
land
or
water
and
whether
it's
one
acre
foot,
or
two
acre
feet,
or
10
acre
feet,
doesn't
make
any
difference.
those
indians
have
a
right
to
the
natural
flow
of
the
river
for
whatever
amount
may
be
necessary
to
satisfactorily
and
sufficiently
irrigate
their
lands.
and
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
as
i've
stated,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
subject
to
litigation
if
this
were
a
filing
under
a
state
statute
authorizing
the
applicant
to
appropriate
a
definite
stated
quantity
of
water.
but
my
position
is
that
the
indians,
having
a
prehistoric
right
to
the
natural
flow
of
the
rio
grande,
continue
to
have
that
right
because
it
was
not
--
there
was
nothing
to
take
it
away
from
them.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
well,
i'll
--
i'll
answer
your
question
piece
meal
if
--
if
i
can.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
what
is
the
natural
flow
is
the
flow
of
the
river
unaided
by
impounded
water.
in
other
words,
it's
--
it's
the
stream
as
it
has
flowed
from
time
immemorial
until
now,
until
it's
dried
up
down
about
for
equipment.
but
i
mean,
a
--
a
direct
diversion
is
--
is
simply
the
taking
of
natural
flow
of
the
river,
what's
in
the
river
by
gravity
out
of
the
bed
of
the
river
and
into
a
--
and
let's
take
your
irrigation
ditch
where
it
flows
by
a
gravity
to
land
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
wouldn't
say
that
no
controversy
could
ever
arise,
but
what
i
was
trying
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
--
with
--
or
would
arise.
i
was
trying
to
lead
up
to
the
present
situation
wherein
i
say
that
the
indians
can
be
protected
in
their
rights
without
the
necessity
of
measuring
the
water.
that's
--
that
is
the
point
to
which
i
was
endeavoring
to
arrive
and
there
are
a
number
of
other
considerations,
i
think,
to
be
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
before
i
reach
that
point.
and
i
was
about
to
mention
at
this
point,
the
federal
filings
of
1906
and
1908
in
new
mexico.
now,
that
was
before
the
--
the
territory
of
new
mexico
became
a
state.
it
--
did
not
become
a
state
until
the
year
1912.
the
reclamation
act,
as
the
court
knows,
of
course,
was
passed
in
1902.
the
act
of
june
the
17th,
1902,
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
undertake
these
various
large
reclamation
projects
in
the
area
--
areas
of
our
country.
and
the
territory
of
new
mexico,
the
--
the
territorial
assembly
passed
special
laws
which
had
relation
only
to
the
united
states
and
were
not
a
part
of
new
mexico's
general
water
code.
those
laws
provided
that
whenever
the
proper
officers
of
the
united
states
applied
to
the
state
engineer
for
the
diversion
of
water
that
thereafter,
that
that
water
should
not
be
subject
to
appropriation
by
anybody
else.
that
was
the
act
of
1906.
under
that
act,
the
united
states
for
the
benefit
of
the
rio
grande
federal
irrigation
project
filed
an
application
with
the
state
engineer
of
new
mexico
seeking
to
appropriate
730,000
acre
feet
of
water
per
year
for
the
use
of
the
project,
and
as
a
source
with
which
to
supply
mexico
under
the
treaty
of
the
may
21st,
1906,
which
is
ordinarily
known
as
the
(inaudible)
treaty.
in
1908,
under
a
subsequent
territorial
enactment
which
also
was
limited
strictly
to
the
united
states,
the
united
states
filed
a
supplemental
application
whereby
it
sought
to
appropriate
all
of
the
then
unappropriated
water
of
the
rio
grande
and
it's
tributaries.
now,
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
provides
that
where
water
rights
have
been
less
secured
for
the
purpose
of
irrigating
federal
reclamation
projects
that
those
rights
are
appurtenant
to
the
land
which
made
the
project
feasible.
so,
our
position
is
that
it
seems
absolutely
clear,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
filings
of
1906
and
1908
were
necessarily
superior
to
any
other
filings
under
the
state
of
new
mexico
which
took
place
thereafter.
now,
in
that
connection,
also,
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
enabling
act
of
1910
passed
by
congress
authorizing
the
admission
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
the
statehood
provided
that
the
united
states
reserved
the
right
of
carrying
out
the
federal
irrigation
project.
and
that
section
also
was
incorporated
in
to
the
constitution
of
new
mexico
in
1912.
so,
there,
we
have
the
--
the
federal
authority
for
the
establishment
of
those
rights
in
the
rio
grande
project.
now,
in
that
connection,
that
project
is
rather
unique
in
the
united
states.
as
far
as
i‘m
aware,
it's
the
only
federal
reclamation
project,
certainly
the
only
one
of
any
size
which
is
located
in
two
different
states.
the
--
the
unit
of
the
rio
grande
federal
reclamation
project
located
in
new
mexico
is
known
as
the
elephant
butte
irrigation
district
consisting
about
90,000
acres.
the
unit
in
texas,
is
el
paso
of
county
water
improvement
district
no.
1
which
irrigates
about
70,000
acres
and
the
government
has
a
warrant
in
that
contract
with
the
(inaudible)
county
district
of
about
18,000
acres.
so,
when
new
mexico
came
in
to
the
union
in
1912,
the
water
rights
were
thoroughly
fixed
and
established
as
far
as
the
federal
rio
grande
reclamation
project
and
the
texas
part
of
it
was
concerned.
now,
at
that
point
or
a
little
later,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
passed
an
act
of
march
the
13th
1928,
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
make
a
contract
with
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
looking
toward
the
improvement
and
the
betterment
of
indian
lands.
and
in
that
act
of
congress,
it
was
specified
that
the
amount
of
present
acreage
of
the
indian
pueblos
within
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
was
8346
acres
which
should
have
prior
rights.
and
that
in
the
agreement
with
the
district,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
provide
concerning
the
additional
indian
acreage
that
they
should
stand
on
the
same
footing
and
have
a
parity
with
other
like
lands
of
the
district.
so
there,
we
have
an
act
of
congress
which
gave
priority
to
a
tentative
8346
acres
of
land
and
the
equality
to
an
additional,
approximately
15,000,
as
they
estimated
it
at
that
time.
now,
pursuant
to
that
authority,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
made
a
contract
of
december
the
14th,
1928,
which
is
in
the
record
whereby,
it
was
agreed
that
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
should
place
improvements
in
this
area
including
the
construction
of
impounding
reservoirs
and
that
the
indians
should
have
certain
rights
under
that
and
recited
the
act
of
congress
and
recited
8346
acres
as
having
priority
with
the
right
to
the
secretary
to
change
that
figure
and
with
some
--
some
15,000,
as
were
recited
there,
having
an
equality
with
the
other
like
lands
of
the
district.
now,
that
contract
provided
that
as
far
as
the
8800--
as
the
8346
acres
of
land
were
concerned,
there
was
to
be
no
charge
for
the
construction
of
impounding
reservoirs,
el
vado
being
one
of
them.
the
el
vado
being
constructed
from
1933
to
1935.
but,
that
such
charges
as
were
made,
were
made
in
behalf
of
the
newly
reclaimed
indian
lands.
so,
under
that
contract,
no
charge
whatever
was
made
to
the
8346
acres.
now,
the
8346
acres
could,
under
no
theory
secure
storage
rights
in
el
vado
because
they
didn't
pay
a
dime
for
it.
and
furthermore,
whatever
rights
that
any
of
them
got
under
that
contract
of
december
the
14th,
1928,
it
had
to
be
under
the
state
of
new
mexico.
in
other
words,
there
was
an
application
made
for
the
construction
of
el
vado.
and
as
i've
said,
it
was
completed
between
1933
and
1935.
so,
the
indian
rights,
as
well
as
all
of
the
other
rights
came
under
and
through
the
state
of
new
mexico
which
could
rise
and
could
rise
no
higher
than
the
rights
of
state
of
new
mexico.
now,
the
state
of
new
mexico
couldn't
grant
rights
and
couldn't
take
rights
itself
that
were
superior
or
--
to
the
--
the
rights
that
had
been
secured
by
the
united
states
in
1906
and
1908
by
the
federal
filings
for
the
benefit
of
the
record
of
the
--
the
federal
rio
grande
reclamation
district
at
that
time.
then,
differences
having
--
having
arisen
there
came
the
contract
of
1929
which
had
the
temporary
compact.
and
in
that
connection,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
article
9
of
the
temporary
compact,
there
is
exactly
the
same
language
with
reference
to
the
indian
rights
as
is
in
the
present,
permanent
contract.
now,
difficulties
arose
over
the
carrying
out
of
the
temporary
compact
of
1929.
texas
came
in
to
this
court
in
1935
alleging
that
new
mexico
had
violated
the
temporary
compact
of
1929
and
asked
that
certain
provisions
of
that
contract
be
enforced.
it
also
asked
for
an
adjudication
of
her
rights
under
the
ordinary
irrigation
laws
of
the
united
states
and
--
and
as
enforced
in
the
western
states
of
this
country.
now,
that
case
involved
the
question
that
we
have
here
now
as
to
the
indispensability
of
the
united
states.
it
was
a
suit
by
the
same
state
of
texas
against
the
same
state
of
new
mexico
and
the
same
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
in
which
were
the
same
six
indian
pueblos
that
are
there
now.
the
court
overruled
that
motion
in
that
case
and
the
present
compact
was
later
executed.
now,
after
that
took
place,
new
mexico
must
have
concluded
or
considered
that
that
language
in
article
9
of
the
temporary
compact
which
was
carried
forward
into
article
16
of
the
present
compact
was
workable
or
she
would
never
had
signed
the
compact,
because
she'd
already
been
through
this
question
of
indispensability
of
the
united
based
on
that
same
--
on
that
same
language
in
the
1929
temporary
compact.
now,
after
that
took
place,
there
was
another
contract
made
between
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
involving
these
indian
rights.
that
was
a
contract
of
september
4th,
1936,
where
it
was
provided
that
--
that
lands
which
had
been
bought
by
the
united
states
for
indian
use
after
1928,
the
date
of
the
act
of
congress
specifying
8346
acres
of
prior
right
land
and
the
rest
of
the
parity
land
should
be
considered
by
the
secretary
in
the
determination
of
the
final
acreage.
and
later,
there
was
a
contract
of
april
the
8th,
1938,
whereby,
the
--
the
language
in
--
in
it
with
reference
to
this
point
was
the
same
except
the
sentence
was
added
classing
the
lands
bought
by
the
united
states
as
being
newly-reclaimed
lands.
so,
when
we
reached
determination
of
that
contract,
we
find
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
under
authority
of
the
act
of
congress,
has
made
the
determination
as
to
what
indian
acreage
it
is
that
has
prior
rights
and
to
what
indian
acreage
it
is
that
has
rights
to
stand
on
the
same
basis
as
farther
like
lands
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district.
on
april
the
8th,
1938,
the
secretary
pursuant
to
the
authority
given
to
him
in
the
act
of
february
1928,
made
that
determination
and
published
it
in
the
federal
register.
at
that
point,
that
the
compact
was
entered
into
between
colorado,
new
mexico,
and
texas,
it
being
the
compact
of
1938.
now,
our
position
is
with
reference
to
that
compact,
of
course,
under
the
doctrine
of
the
hinderlider
case
that
it
necessarily
bound
all
of
the
water
uses
in
new
mexico
by
the
terms
of
that
compact.
and
the
compact
provides
with
reference
to
the
waters
of
the
rio
grande
that
a
certain
percentage
of
water
originating
in
colorado
should
be
allocated
to
colorado
with
the
rest
going
down
into
new
mexico
and
that
new
mexico
should
be
entitled
to
receive
a
certain
percentage
of
the
waters
of
the
rio
grande
originating
in
new
mexico
plus
that
quantity
which
came
down
from
colorado,
and
that
the
remainder,
if
there
was
any,
should
pass
on
down
to
the
state
of
texas.
article
4
of
the
compact
has
a
scale
of
measurement
there
determining
the
amount
of
water
that
new
mexico
is
under
obligation
to
deliver
to
texas.
and
that
depends
on
the
amount
of
water
passing
the
upper
gaging
station
at
otowi
as
related
to
the
lower
station
down
at
san
marcial.
whenever,
the
flow
at
otowi
is
less
than
100,000
acre
feet,
new
mexico
is
under
no
obligation
under
the
compact
to
deliver
even
so
much
as
a
teacup
full
of
water
at
san
marcial,
the
lower
gaging
station.
but
if
200,000
acre
feet
passes
the
gaging
station
at
otowi,
then
according
to
the
terms
of
the
compact,
65,000
acre
feet
is
to
be
delivered
at
san
marcial.
in
other
words,
that's
32.5%.
and
there
is
a
sliding
scale
on
that
so
where
--
where
under
if
the
condition
never
existed,
where
i
say
is
900,000
acre
feet
were
gaged
at
otowi,
then
the
state
of
new
mexico
would
be
under
obligation
to
deliver
in
the
elephant
butte
reservoir
742,000
acre
feet
or
74
and
two
tenths
percent
of
the
whole.
now,
our
position
is
that
that
obligation
is
just
as
valid
and
just
as
binding
as
the
promissory
note
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
money
at
a
stated
time.
and
it
is
not
due
to
the
--
to
the
draft,
it
is
due
texas
says
because
of
conditions
which
the
state
of
new
mexico
has
brought
about
herself
and
by
the
allowance
of
the
accumulation
of
non-beneficial
vegetation
in
the
river
by
failing
to
keep
the
weeds
cleaned
out
of
the
ditches,
their
--
their
canals
and
drains
have
built
up
to
where
the
water
level
of
the
area
has
been
raised
into
small
plants
and
evaporation
has
taken
place
and
large
quantities
of
water
which
should
have
been
delivered
to
texas
have
been
withheld
by
new
mexico
or
dissipated
or
allowed
to
escape
so
that
they
never
went
into
elephant
butte
reservoir.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
testimony
of
the
engineer
advisor
to
the
commissioner
for
the
state
of
texas
to
the
effect
that
new
mexico
could
remedy
this
condition
by
reducing
per
water
consumption
10%.
and
he
stated
that
that
could
be
done
by
the
elimination
of
non-beneficial
uses
without
affecting
the
indian
lands
at
all
or
without
affecting
anybody's
land,
if
they
would
go
in
there
and
expend
some
money
in
cleaning
out
these
ditches
and
--
and
elevating
their
water
table.
the
same
condition
existed
20
years
ago
prior
to
the
1929
contract
when
they
had
a
--
a
graded
river
badge,
they
had
a
--
a
graded
canals
and
ditches,
and
they
did
go
in
there
and
they
remedy
their
situation.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
they
had
$300,000
which
was
available
for
that
purpose
and
$300,000
will
certainly
get
lots
of
weeds
and
vegetation
out
of
the
irrigation
canals.
the
result
of
the
building
up
of
these
various
circumstances
and
occasions
is,
as
we
see
it,
that
88,047
acres
of
the
indian
land
undoubtedly
has
prior
rights.
now,
as
to
what
has
been
done
in
the
way
of
delivering
water
to
the
indians
is
this,
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
has
allowed
all
of
its
canals
and
laterals
to
run
bank-full.
and
they've
said
to
the
indians,
“here
it
is,
help
yourself.”
the
record
shows
that
that
has
been
their
procedure
for
more
than
--
for
who
else
--
yes,
for
approximately
30
years.
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
was
organized
in
1925,
and
doing
all
of
that
time
since
it's
organization
through
good
years
and
bad
years,
and
every
other
kind
of
years,
they
have
allowed
that
water
to
run
through
their
canals,
bank-full
and
they
have
allowed
the
indians
and
non-indians
and
everybody
else
to
help
themselves
without
any
question
of
measurement
of
water
or
how
much
you're
entitled
to,
take
all
you
want,
there
it
is.
now,
that
being
the
--
the
situation
in
--
yes,
and
in
connection
with
that
too,
the
record
shows
that
in
1938,
about
the
time
and
negotiations
for
the
new
compact
to
the
permanent
compact
were
taking
place
between
new
mexico
and
texas.
they
pulled
every
gauge
they
had,
offer
their
canals
and
the
record
shows
that
prior
to
that
time,
they
did
have
them.
they
had
--
according
to
the
testimony
of
their
engineer,
they
had
gauges
on
all
of
their
main
canals
on
all
of
their
laterals
and
ditches.
but
there's
no
explanation
of
why
that
about
the
time
this
compact
was
signed,
they
pulled
everyone
of
them
off
there.
and
there's
no
explanation
of
what
they
did
with
the
records.
and
now,
they
come
in
and
say,
we
don't
know
how
much
to
give
the
indians,
although,
the
record
shows
it
for
several
years,
prior
to
1938,
they've
been
measuring
that
water.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
would
like
to
say
this
in
--
in
connection
with
--
with
the
briefs.
our
authorities
are
presented
to
the
court
in
the
plaintiff's
brief
in
reply
to
the
brief
of
the
defendants
on
the
question
of
indispensability
of
parties
and
in
the
plaintiff's
objections
to
the
report
of
the
special
master
respecting
indispensability
of
the
parties.
now,
as
i've
stated,
there
have
been
21
printed
documents
filed
here
and
then
texas
saw
no
reason
for
repeating
and
--
and
reciting
to
the
court
the
cases
which
had
been
set
forth
in
these
two
briefs.
so
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
don't
know
that
you'll
find
all
of
my
arguments,
but
all
our
--
our
authorities
are
in
the
briefs
and
in
substance,
the
--
the
arguments
are
--
are
in
the
brief.
of
course,
i
have
added
some
and
there's
been
some
variation
to
it
naturally
in
--
in
the
course
of
an
oral
discussion,
there
would
be.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
and
it
did
present
it
in
exactly
the
same
way,
but
i
have
presented
it
in
this
way
here
now
in
order
to
call
to
the
courts
attention
what
i
considered
to
be
the
salient
features
leading
up
to
the
situation
whereby
we
say
that
it
cannot
be
detrimental
to
new
mexico
to
grant
their
relief
as
we
have
asked
for
it
here
now.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
no
sir.
i
think
not.
not
--
not,
no
sir.
not
the
full
argument,
because
of
what
i'm
getting
ready
to
say
now
is
not
in
the
briefs.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
the
--
the
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
the
--
the
substance
of
it,
your
honor,
is
in
there.
the
--
the
substance
of
all
of
it
is
in
there
and
the
authorities
are
all
in
there.
but
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
--
in
going
through
the
record
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
pardon?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
no,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
yes.
there
--
there's
an
answer
to
it
in
this
way.
the
contract
of
--
of
september
the
24th,
1951,
was
set
out
in
the
--
in
the
reply
brief
or
return,
set
out
in
one
of
the
documents
filed
in
by
the
defendants.
and
now,
it's
a
good
place
as
any
to
discuss
that.
they
come
in
and
say
that
the
united
states
is
an
indispensable
party
because
of
that
contract
of
september
the
24th,
1951,
its
exhibit
b
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
--
to
the
defendants
return
to
the
rule
of
sure
course
--
i
--
i
believe
it
is,
yes,
that's
it.
they
said
it
because
of
that
contract,
united
states,
has
secured
an
interest.
now,
that's
the
contract
whereby
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
has
agreed
to
turnover
its
works
to
the
united
states
and
--
and
the
united
states
will
make
certain
improvements,
and
after
they'd
paid
for,
there'll
be
reconvened
to
the
district
and
all
that
sort
of
things.
now,
in
that
connection,
several
years
ago,
before
this
matter
came
up
whereby
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
desired
to
turn
this
over
to
the
united
states,
the
matter
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
states
of
colorado,
new
mexico,
and
texas.
and
texas
became
very
much
concerned
about
it,
being
apprehensive
that
if
any
such
arrangement
were
made
that
it
would
be
detrimental
to
the
rights
of
texas
under
the
rio
grande
compact.
and
for
that
reason,
as
it's
shown
by
the
letter
of
governor
in
view
for
gesture
in
the
record,
texas
vigorously
protested,
unless,
there
was
a
qualification
to
this
authorization
whereby
new
mexico
--
whereby,
the
--
the
operation
of
the
new
mexico
facilities
would
be
limited
to
a
compliance
with
the
rio
grande
--
with
the
rio
grande
compact.
and
in
pursuance
of
that
objection
and
protest
that
was
made
by
the
state
of
texas,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
when
they
authorized
this
arrangement
with
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
put
in
the
act
that
it
was
conditioned
on
the
operation
of
the
project
facilities
of
the
middle
rio
grande
project
being
in
conformity
with
the
rio
grande
compact
as
administered
by
the
rio
grande
compact
commission.
so,
under
that
act
of
congress,
the
united
states
nor
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
nor
any
of
these
officers
or
agents
can
open
a
gate,
can
turn
a
wheel,
or
can
operate
a
valve,
unless
it
be
in
conformity
with
the
rio
grande
compact.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
yes
sir.
that's
--
that's
--
i
think
a
full
answer,
because
the
--
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
possession
or
to
operation,
or
to
do
anything
else
is
conditional
upon
its
compliance
with
the
rio
grande
compact
as
administered
by
the
rio
grande
compact
commission,
and
that's
in
--
that's
in
our
brief,
that's
--
that's
cited,
the
--
the
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
pardon
me?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
would
say
this,
that
if
a
water
master
is
appointed
as
we
have
prayed
for
in
this
litigation,
it
would
be
the
water
master
that
was
controlling
the
situation.
he
would
have
controlled
by
authority
of
this
court.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
no
authority
at
all
except
he's
authorized
by
act
of
congress
which
is
that
they
shall
stay
within
the
rio
grande
--
the
terms
of
the
rio
grande
compact.
now,
getting
back
to
your
question
about
whether
--
whether
the
bureau
of
reclamation
would
be
unfair?
yes.
we
--
we
don't
contend
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
would
deliberately
go
out
and
undertake
to
operate
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
project
in
a
method
that
was
in
violation
of
the
compact.
but,
somebody
has
got
to
tell
the
officer
or
agent
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
when
he
releases
water,
how
much
water
is
needed?
and
that's
the
commissioner
for
new
mexico.
in
other
words,
the
way
these
--
these
federal
projects
are
--
are
operated,
your
honor,
is
that
of
course,
the
--
the
bureau
of
reclamation
officials
are
acting
under
their
general
instructions
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
they
issued
their
instruction
to
their
subordinates,
and
finally,
it
trickles
on
down
to
the
man
who's
over
there
that
operates
the
switch,
that
operates
the
electric
motor,
that
operates
the
gates
and
opens
the
gates
and
lets
out
the
water.
well,
now,
he
doesn't
know
how
long
to
keep
the
gate
open
and
how
long
to
--
to
release
water
unless
he's
told.
now,
the
--
the
commissioners
who
are
in
charge
of
the
--
of
the
rio
grande
compact
has
their
--
their
meetings
and
they
confer
on
the
situation
and
how
much
water
is
needed
and
how
much
will
be
released.
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation
in
conjunction
with
the
--
the
commissioners
and
the
water
improvement
districts
will
know
that
--
that
on
such
and
such
a
day,
so
much
water
ought
to
be
released.
now,
the
--
the
gate
tender
or
the
bureau
of
reclamation
or
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
if
you
want
to
call
him,
because
after
all
he's
doing,
he's
not
going
tosay
to
the
land
owner,
set
out
and
take
this
water
because
it's
good
for
you
at
this
time.
they
don't
do
that.
that
--
that
has
to
be
worked
out
as
to
--
as
to
when
the
water
is
needed.
so,
whereas
you
have
a
provision
here
whereby,
the
united
states
will
come
in
and
--
and
do
this
operation
for
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district,
yet
the
congress,
as
a
result
of
the
protest
by
texas
has
limited
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
do
anything
other
than
operate
it
in
conformity
with
the
rio
grande
compact.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
pardon
me?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
just
a
minute,
i
will
refer
you
to
it.
that
is
62
statute
1171
which
is
quoted
in
the
plaintiff's
brief,
in
reply
to
the
defendant's
brief
on
indispensability.
on
page
28,
and
it
reads
this
way,
a
--
a
part
of
it.
“construction
of
the
spillway
gate
structure
at
chamita
dam
shall
be
deferred
so
long
as
new
mexico
shall
have
accrued
debits
as
defined
by
the
rio
grande
compact
and
until
new
mexico
shall
consistently
accrue
credits
pursuant
to
the
rio
grande
compact.”
and
it
further
provides
in
subsection
(b),
“at
all
times
when
new
mexico
shall
have
accrued
debits
as
defined
by
the
rio
grand
compact
all
reservoirs
constructed
as
a
part
of
the
project
shall
be
operated
solely
for
flood
control
except
as
otherwise
required
by
the
rio
grande
compact,
and
at
all
times
projects
works
shall
be
operated
in
conformity
with
the
rio
grande
compact
as
it
is
administered
by
the
rio
grande
compact
commission.”
that
is
the
limit,
the
measure,
and
the
extent
of
the
authority
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
to
do
anything
with
any
of
the
facilities
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
think
the
gist
of
it
is
in
the
last
clause
of
the
last
sentence
which
i
read.
in
conformity
with
the
rio
grande
compact,
as
it
is
administered
by
the
rio
grande
compact
commission,
not
somebody
up
in
washington
or
of
some
field
headquarters
or
something,
but
as
--
but
as
it
has
been
administered
by
the
rio
grande
compact
commission.
that's
what
the
commission
was
created
for
by
the
compact.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
oh,
i
--
i
doubt
if
any
document
ever
was
drawn
that
--
that
somebody
couldn't
say
they
didn't
understand
if
they
wanted
to
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
oh,
that
--
that
might
be
--
that
might
be
true.
but
when
they
say
that
it's
to
be
administered
in
conformity
with
the
rio
grande
compact
as
administered
by
the
rio
grande
compact
commission,
that
--
that
seems
plain
and
clear.
i
don't
see
any
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
pardon?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
there
is
the
state
engineer
of
the
state
of
new
--
of
the
state
of
colorado,
who
ex
officio
is
the
rio
grande
compact
commissioner
for
colorado.
there
is
the
state
engineer
of
new
mexico,
who
is
ex
officio,
the
rio
grande
compact
commissioner
for
the
state
of
new
mexico.
there
is
a
third
member,
who
is
the
commissioner
for
the
state
of
texas,
who
is
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
texas
because
texas
has
no
state
engineer.
with
reference
to
water
matters,
they
have
a
highway
department
and
a
highway
engineer
but
they
do
not
have
a
state
water
engineer
as
to
the
other
states.
so,
those
three
men,
up
to
the
present
time
have
administered
the
rio
grande
compact.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
well,
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
don't
think
there's
much
occasion
for
frustration
there
your
honor
in
these
that
the
rio
grande
compact
commissioners
have
administered
the
rio
grande
compact
ever
since
it
was
entered
into
in
1938.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
this
--
this
issue
has
not
the
question
of
indispensability
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
that
wouldn't
do
any
good
because
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
has
said
in
their
resolution
in
substance,
“we
don't
care
anything
about
the
compact,
we're
going
to
take
that
water
and
give
it
to
our
people.
“
and
that's
what
they
had
done
according
to
the
allegations
of
texas.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
said
who
can
do
it.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
well,
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
very
reasons
for
being
before
this
court
is
to
have
the
court
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
the
united
states
is
not,
but
the
united
states
can't
do
anything
according
to
our
theory,
except
in
conformity
with
this
act
of
congress
which
limits
them
to
the
--
the
compact
as
administered
by
the
compact
commissioners.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
they
--
they
may
not
have
our
view
of
the
law,
but
we've
got
the
act
of
congress
and
that's
all
we've
done
[laughs]
and
we
think
that
that's
what
--
we
think
that's
what's
controlling.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
if
it
please
the
court.
there's
one
other
brief
reference
that
i
want
to
make
in
connection
with
the
contract
in
1951,
september
24th,
1951,
whereby
the
government
is
expecting
to
take
over
the
operation
of
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
facilities.
and
that
is
the
case
of
nebraska
against
wyoming,
325
u.s.
589,
wherein
the
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
that
was
the
case
--
a
suit
of
nebraska
against
wyoming
to
determine
the
rights
of
nebraska
and
wyoming
in
the
waters
of
the
laramie
river,
i
believe,
and
nebraska
had
claimed
that
wyoming
was
making
excessive
appropriations
of
the
waters
of
the
river
in
that
state
to
the
detriment
of
appropriators
in
nebraska.
the
--
the
united
states
intervened
ultimately
in
that
case.
they
hadn't
done
so
when
it
originated
but
it
did
before
its
final
conclusion
and
set
up
their
rights
which
they
claimed
to
exist
by
reason
of
the
ownership
of
the
water
as
a
result
of
the
construction
of
reclamation
works
and
reservoirs
in
wyoming
under
the
authority
of
the
wyoming
irrigation
statutes.
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
to
allocate
water
rights
in
an
interstate
stream
to
the
several
states
in
nowise
interferes
with
the
ownership
and
operation
by
the
united
states
of
the
storage
and
power
plants,
works
and
facilities
constructed
by
it
on
the
stream
pursuant
to
the
reclamation
act
or
under
that
act,
the
water
does
not
belong
to
the
united
states
but
it's
appurtenant
to
the
land
served
by
the
project.
now,
that
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
there
are
--
there
are
two
reports
of
that
case
as
your
honor
will
recall.
the
first
one
was
back
10
years
before
the
one
in
which
your
honor
wrote
the
opinion
and
in
the
--
in
the
first
report
of
the
case,
colorado
had
not
been
made
a
party
and
the
united
states
had
not
intervened.
and
nebraska
in
--
and
wyoming
in
that
case
was
insisting
that
colorado
was
an
indispensable
party
and
i
think
that
the
united
states
was
too,
but
anyway
consist
--
that
--
that
colorado
was
and
the
court
held
there
that
colorado
was
not
an
indispensable
party
because
no
relief
was
asked
against
colorado
and
there
were
no
allegations
that
colorado
had
done
anything
to
the
detriment
of
nebraska.
and
the
united
states
after
it
came
in
set
up
that
it
owned
the
water
rights
by
reason
of
owning
the
project
facilities
that
were
constructed
pursuant
to
the
reclamation
project
in
wyoming.
and
this
court
held
that
they
didn't
own
the
water
rights
and
that
the
allocation
of
the
rights
in
the
river
to
the
several
states
in
nowise
interfered
with
any
rights
of
the
united
states
because
the
united
states
didn't
own
the
water.
the
water
was
appurtenant
to
the
land
under
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act.
now,
in
the
case
that
we
got
here,
the
united
states
doesn't
own
the
water.
they're
just
operating
the
project
facilities
and
that's
what
they
intend
to
do.
incidentally,
there's
a
supplemental
contract
which
isn't
in
the
record
other
than
it
appears
in
the
last
pleading
filed
by
the
defendants
in
this
case,
it
shows
that
there
is
an
agreement
there
that
the
united
states
is
not
going
to
operate
el
vado
anyway,
except
as
a
temporary
and
expedient
matter
in
making
the
pass.
that
is
--
appears
at
page
36
and
37
of
the
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
special
master
in
brief
and
support
thereof,
article
iv
--
article
xiii
(a)
have
said
basic
contracts
should
be
revised
to
read
as
follows,
“effective
february
the
1st,
1955,
the
united
states
shall
assume
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
district
works
with
the
exception
of
el
vado
dam
and
reservoir."
now,
that
--
that's
not
in
the
record
and
hadn't
developed
on
the
hearing
but
--
but
from
this
last
document
which
is
filed
by
the
defendants
here,
we
see
that
as
a
result
of
the
negotiations
indicting
back
and
forth
between
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
district,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
is
living
el
vado
dam
and
reservoir
out
of
it.
now,
paragraph
(5)
is
merely
to
permit
them
to
make
certain
temporary
affairs
on
the
dam,
as
required
to
permit
the
rehabilitation
and
betterment
of
the
works
to
proceed
without
undue
interruption.
during
the
period
of
operation
and
maintenance
by
the
united
states
that's
provided
in
article
iv,
there's
a
mandatory
contract
and
article
iv
says
that
they're
not
to
operate
el
--
el
vado
reservoir.
the
project
water
including
water
for
indian
lands
now
served
by
the
district
facilities
set
forth
in
article
xxxiv
of
the
basic
contract
and
available
from
el
vado
dam
and
reservoir
shall
be
release
by
the
district
in
accordance
with
such
instructions
received
in
the
contracting
officer.
now,
as
--
in
my
concluding
remarks,
i'd
like
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
equity
here
the
granting
of
the
relief
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
yes,
sir.
sir?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
no,
five
related
to
four.
i
don't
think
i
mentioned
six,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
--
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
the
contracting
officer,
your
honor,
is
--
is
the
representative
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
for
the
5th
district
at
amarillo,
his
name
is
robert
w.
jennings.
he
signed
for
the
united
states
of
america.
the
--
the
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
--
the
district
is
in
the
fifth
region.
that
is
--
the
secretary
has
--
the
united
states
divided
it
up
into
regions
for
the
administration
of
the
reclamation
act
and
this
area
is
in,
as
i
understand
it,
the
5th
district
which
is
under
mr.
robert
w.
jennings,
whose
headquarter
is
in
amarillo,
texas.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
apparently,
that
is
true
during
the
period
when
the
government
is
making
repairs
on
el
vado.
now,
as
i
understand
the
situation
pursuant
to
article
iv
here,
the
el
vado
dam
is
not
to
be
taken
over.
there's
a
part
of
the
works
that
are
going
to
be
continued,
pre-operated
by
the
united
states,
but
the
united
states
is
consented
to
make
certain
repairs
on
el
vado
dam.
now,
i
construe
paragraph
(5)
to
mean
that
while
these
repairs
are
going
on
that
the
water
will
be
released
pursuant
to
instructions
from
the
contracting
officer,
who
is
mr.
jennings.
now,
in
that
connection,
if
--
if
i
may
go
out
of
the
record
a
little
bit,
i
--
i
think
this
is
out
of
the
record
itself.
i
understand
that
what
they're
doing,
they're
consulting
the
--
the
commissioner
for
colorado,
texas
and
new
mexico
to
find
out
whether
they
can
go
in
behind
the
dam
and
make
these
repairs
at
this
time.
well,
that
will
interfere
with
--
with
what
the
commissioners
want
done.
now,
that
--
that
isn't
in
the
record
and
--
and
neither
is
this
supplementary
contract
in
the
record
either.
it's
--
it's
on
here
as
an
appendix
to
that
--
to
this
last
brief
that
is
filed
but
it's
not
a
part
of
the
efficient
record
to
the
hearings
that
have
taken
place
so
far.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
don't
think
that
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
of
that
because
as
i
conceived
the
law,
the
only
court
that
has
jurisdiction
of
an
action
by
a
state
against
another
state
to
enforce
a
compact
is
this
present
tribunal.
now,
what
we
--
what
we're
endearing
to
do
is
to
enforce
the
compact
signed
by
states
of
texas,
colorado
and
new
mexico
and
this
is
a
court
in
which
to
do
it.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
don't
think
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
don't
think
they
could
get
it
at
all
because
in
court
--
the
district
court
in
new
mexico
wouldn't
have
any
power
to
compel
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
live
up
to
this
contract.
now,
we
have
said
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
pardon?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
because
the
allegations
that
have
been
made
in
the
petition
or
complaint
are
that
new
--
new
mexico
has
violated
articles
vi,
vii
and
viii
of
the
compact.
now,
there's
no
way
of
enforcing
the
compact
except
before
this
court
because
no
other
court
can
do
it.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
that
is
true,
but
what
i
said
was
that
this
court
was
the
only
court
that
had
jurisdiction
of
suits
between
states
to
enforce
interstate
compacts.
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
--
that's
what
i
said.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
well,
the
--
the
act
of
congress
--
i
see
my
time
is
up,
your
honor,
shall
i
continue?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
gives
to
this
court
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
suits
between
states.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
whoever
drafted
that
act,
i
think
had
their
eye
on
this
case
when
they
did
it.
i
thought
so
--
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
--
when
i
first
read
it.
yes?
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
well,
it
--
it
looks
like
that
--
that
you
could
bring
the
united
states
into
an
action
involving
the
distribution
of
water
in
--
in
a
stream
but,
nevertheless,
i
think
you
still
couldn't
get
at
the
relief
that
texas
is
trying
to
get,
except
in
this
court
because
we
are
endearing
to
enforce
a
contract
made
by
another
state
and
as
we
conceive
it,
this
is
the
only
court
in
which
we
can
get
that
relief.
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
t.
edwards
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
that
would
afford
relief.
that
is
--
unless
there
were
some
binding
authority
or
power
or
some
force
that
could
compel
with
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
live
up
to
the
compact.
i
don't
believe
that
we
would
get
results
otherwise
because
the
state
of
new
mexico
was
fully
informed
as
to
the
situation
and
did
nothing
about
restraining
the
middle
rio
grande
conservancy
district
from
--
in
effect
violating
the
compact
by
excessive
use
of
water
and
by
storing
the
water
in
these
reservoirs.
i
don't
know
what
the
state
of
new
mexico
could
have
done
except
call
out
the
militia
and
they
didn't
know
that.
so
that's
why
we're
in
this
court
is
to
try
to
get
something
to
compel
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
live
up
to
the
contract.
thank
you
sir.
