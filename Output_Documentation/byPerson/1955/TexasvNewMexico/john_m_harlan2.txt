justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down
mr.
wilson?
i'd
understood
that
the
proposed
decree
would
operate
in
such
a
way
that
if
a
dispute
arose
as
to
the
amount
of
indian
water,
the
secretary
of
interior
would
give
the
figure
and
that
could
be
the
figure,
is
that
the
way
that
contract
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
proposed
to
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
but
doesn't
that
leave
that
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
speak
for
the
indians?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
position
on
that
score
is
(inaudible)
stronger
isn't
it
that
on
the
indian
point.
isn't
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
your
position
on
this
latter
point,
in
el
vado
the
control
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
whatever
the
decree
by
virtue
of
this
contract,
the
united
states
is
in
a
position
by
refusing
to
allow
withdrawal
of
water
to
completely
afford
the
decree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
novelty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

with
that
is
that
while
one
hates
to
assume
that
the
united
states
isn't
going
to
play
ball
in
good
faith,
nevertheless,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
proposition
that
if
you
win
right
down
the
line
in
this
case,
get
the
decree
that
you
wish.
and
the
united
states,
and
for
some
reason
decides
that
it
will
not
release
the
amount
of
water
which
it
will
--
it
will
be
required
to
do
under
these
contracts
as
you
have
given.
how
could
the
decree
of
this
court
come
to
bear
and
on
the
united
states
to
require
to
do
so?
