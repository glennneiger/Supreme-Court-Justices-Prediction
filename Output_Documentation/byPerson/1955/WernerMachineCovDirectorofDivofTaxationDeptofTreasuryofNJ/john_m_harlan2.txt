mr.
goodwin,
are
you
--
are
you
claiming
that
this
is
not
a
substance
of
franchise
tax
or
are
you
claiming
that
a
--
even
though
it
is
a
franchise
tax
it's
still
invalid
because
it's
measured
by
assets
which
include
their
government
bonds?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
new
jersey
realty
case,
the
statute
didn't
purport
to
make
it
a
franchise
tax,
did
it?

--

it
would've
denominated
a
franchise
tax
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
you
can
argue
the
other
way
that
it
was
a
property
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

the
court
went.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you'd
agree
that
a
--
at
least
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
so
far
that
there's
a
distinction
between
a
tax
levied
on
the
property
as
such
and
a
franchise
tax
or
a
privilege
tax
which
is
measured
by
the
same
property,
it
maybe
a
distinction
without
a
difference
but
there's
that
distinction,
you'll
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
