mr.
harold
kolovsky
if
the
court
please.
new
jersey
has
had
a
corporation
franchise
tax
for
some
70
years.
the
last
substantial
revision
was
in
1906
when
a
franchise
tax
was
adopted,
when
the
tax
measured
by
the
numbers
of
shares
of
capital
stock
issued
and
outstanding.
that
tax
measured
by
the
number
of
issued
and
outstanding
capital
share
--
shares
of
capital
stock
remain
in
effect
until
it
was
repealed
in
1945
by
the
statute
now
before
this
court.
if
in
fact
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
did
not,
as
it
expressly
said
it
did,
accomplished
a
franchise
tax
by
the
act
before
this
court.
we
have
no
franchise
tax
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
applicable
to
the
ordinary
domestic
corporation.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
question
and
there
can
be
no
question
from
a
reading
of
the
act.
and
from
a
reading
of
the
--
and
from
consideration
of
the
history
of
the
legislation
and
the
background
of
the
legislation
that
the
act
of
1945
is
exactly
what
it
purports
to
be
a
corporate
franchise
tax,
exactly
what
the
courts
of
new
jersey
have
uniformly
construed
it
to
be,
a
franchise
tax.
the
act
by
its
title
which
is,
of
course,
under
our
constitution
an
important
--
important
to
legislation
is
expressly
entitled
an
act
to
provide
for
the
imposition
of
a
franchise
tax
upon
certain
corporations
and
for
the
distribution
of
the
proceeds
thereof
repealing
sections
54-131
through
54-138
and
chapter
32a
of
title
54,
the
revised
statutes
in
making
appropriation
of
the
administration
of
such
act.
now,
sections
54-131
to
54-138
referred
to
in
the
title
is
the
preexisting
franchise
tax
on
domestic
corporations,
chapter
32a
is
the
preexisting
franchise
tax
on
foreign
corporations
which
have
procured
authority
to
do
business
in
the
state.
the
appellant
throughout
its
argument
has
argued
as
if
the
franchise,
the
privilege
being
tax
is
purely
and
simply
the
privilege
of
owning
property,
but
that's,
of
course,
obviously
not
so.
it's
not
so
by
the
expressed
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
every
domestic
or
foreign
corporation,
which
is
not
hereafter
exempted,
hereinafter
exempted,
shall
pay
an
annual
franchise
tax
for
the
year
1946
and
each
--
each
year
thereafter,
is
here
and
after
provided
for
the
privilege
of
having
or
exercising
its
corporate
franchise
in
the
state
or
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
employing
or
owning
capital
or
property
or
maintaining
an
office
in
the
state.
we
all
recognized
and
i
think
the
cases
have
uniformly
recognized
that
the
privilege
of
being
a
corporation,
the
privilege
of
exercising
corporate
franchises
is
a
valuable
and
substantial
right.
i
need
to
refer
no
further
than
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
flint
against
the
stone
tracy
company,
where
the
court
pointed
out
in
upholding
the
validity
of
a
franchise
tax
act
measured
by
net
income,
which
necessarily
included
net
income
from
federal
securities
as
well.
but
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
continuity
of
the
business
without
interruption
by
death
or
dissolution,
the
transfer
of
property
interest
by
the
disposition
of
shares
of
stock,
the
advantages
of
business
controlled
and
managed
by
corporate
directors,
the
general
absence
of
individual
liability,
these
and
other
things
inhere
and
the
advantages
of
business
thus
conducted
which
do
no
exist
when
the
same
business
is
conducted
by
private
individuals
or
partnerships.
it
is
this
distinctive
privilege
which
is
the
subject
of
taxation,
not
the
mere
buying
or
selling
or
handling
of
goods,
which
may
be
the
same
whether
done
by
corporations
or
individuals.
so
that
--
i
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
what
we
have
is
a
valuable
right
which
is
tax
and
a
right
which
the
state
has
the
right
to
tax.
that
has
been
settled
for
more
than
hundred
years
in
this
court
and
almost
as
long
by
the
lower
cases
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
harold
kolovsky
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
the
property
of
the
corporation
is
subject
to
exactly
the
same
taxes,
any
individual
is
subject
to
and
that
appears
expressly
in
the
property
tax
sections
of
a
statute.
that
appears
in
chapter
4
of
title
54
and
specifically
rs54:4-2,
expressly
provides,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
--
or
i
can
give
you
the
exact
language
now,
54:4-2.
mr.
harold
kolovsky
i
don't
know
whether
there's
a
reference
to
it
in
the
brief.
i
believe
not,
sir.
and
expressly
provides
except
as
otherwise
provided
as
to
particular
corporations
or
property
real
and
personal
of
a
corporation
shall
be
taxed
the
same
as
the
real
and
personal
property
of
an
individual,
so
that
as
far
as
property
taxes
are
concerned
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
54:4-2.
mr.
harold
kolovsky
with
respect
to
specific
corporations.
that
refers,
sir,
to
certain
utilities
which
are
taxed
and
the
property
which
is
taxed
in
a
different
way.
railroads
are
now
taxed
in
somewhat
different
way
and
--
but
that
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
--
that
is
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
that
refers,
if
the
court
please,
to
intangible
personal
property.
and
for
that
if
i
may
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
--
just
give
a
brief
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
that's
right,
but
we
have
no
intangible
personal
property
tax
in
new
jersey
at
all
now.
and
if
i
may
just
give
a
slight
background
of
that
to
show,
and
i
think
it
perhaps
might
clear
some
of
the
reference
to
the
commission
report
that
the
appellant
referred
to.
historically,
new
jersey
is
an
agrarian
state.
the
basic
taxation
is
local
property
taxation.
it
wasn't
an
agrarian
state
at
one
time.
and
so
for
many
years,
the
statute
in
new
jersey
provided
for
that
all
property,
real
or
personal,
should
be
assessed
by
local
assessing
districts.
and
that
included
not
only
real
property,
not
only
tangible
personal
property
but
also
intangible
personal
property.
it
included
it,
i'm
afraid
in
theory
more
than
in
practice,
because
for
many
years,
and
--
and
bear
in
mind
that
that
--
that
provided
--
that
applied
both
to
individuals
and
to
corporations,
but
for
many
years,
the
assessors
of,
i
should
say
most
of
the
local
assessing
districts
in
the
state,
did
not
assess
intangible
property
with
very
few
exceptions
and
there
was
no
pattern
and
it
was
just
hit
or
miss.
periodically,
we've
had
studies
made
of
the
tax
structure
in
new
jersey
and
periodically,
the
reports
will
says
something
should
be
done.
it
was
brought
to
ahead,
however
again,
in
the
late
1930s
when
some
of
our
cities,
particularly
jersey
city
up
in
the
northern
end
of
the
state,
proceeded
to
assess
intangible
personal
property
for
the
first
time
and
that
had
--
this
impact.
jersey
city
is,
the
court
may
know,
is
the
registered
office
of
a
great
many
nationally
operating
corporations
which
happened
to
be
new
jersey
corporations,
so
that
the
situs
of
the
intangibles
for
the
purpose
of
taxation
at
that
time
was
considered
in
jersey
city.
well,
lo
and
behold
when
the
city
started
to
move,
these
corporations
were
faced
where
the
taxation
on
their
tremendous
intangibles
at
the
local
tax
rate
which
ran
somewhere
around
$70
a
1000,
so
that
--
we
then
had
a
situation
where
some
of
them
had
to
pay.
they
made
a
settlement
at
some
nominal
amount
which
was
contrary,
of
course,
to
the
law
as
far
as
the
local
assessor
is
concerned
because
all
property
was
to
be
assessed
at
the
same
rate.
other
corporations
did
something
else.
many
of
them
moved
to
a
little
town
called
flemington
in
hunterdon
county.
it's
a
foreign
community.
and
one
lawyer,
i
think
basically
one
lawyer,
former
judge
lodge,
became
in
the
--
his
office
became
the
registered
office
a
great
number
of
these
national
corporations.
the
impact
on
the
tax
rate
in
flemington
was
considerable
from
a
tax
rate
which
have
gone
i
think
about
$35
or
$40
a
1000.
in
a
couple
of
years,
the
tax
rate
in
flemington
came
down
about
$0.48
a
1000.
the
state
realized
that
it
was
a
situation
which
couldn't
continue,
so
a
commission
was
appointed.
it
was
an
eminent
commission
headed
by
professor
sly
of
princeton
and
they
made
a
study
of
the
entire
tax
structure
of
new
jersey.
i
have
left
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
copies
of
the
commission's
report,
enough
copies
for
distribution
to
each
member
of
the
court.
the
commission
studied
the
problem
and
then
discussed
a
series
of
possible
proposals
for
changing
the
tax
structure
of
new
jersey,
particularly
as
it
concerned
intangible
property.
and
so
in
--
it
recommended
that
all
taxation
of
intangible
property,
property
taxation
of
intangible
property
be
eliminated
and
that
was
done
by
an
amendment
in
--
an
act
also
passed
in
1945,
which
is
the
act
which
the
appellant
in
its
footnote
on
page
5
of
its
brief
refers
to.
and
refers
to
i
submit
in
--
in
language
to
which
suggest
that
we
there
eliminated
the
exemption
of
federal
securities
in
order
to
reach
him
under
this
franchise
tax.
that's
not
so
at
all.
our
intangible
franchise
tax
law
had
some
70
exemptions
including
not
only
federal
securities
but
bonds
secured
by
mortgages
in
a
great
variety
with
intangible
personal
property
being
eliminated
completely,
of
course,
all
the
exemptions
were
eliminated.
so
that
as
far
as
property
taxation
is
concerned,
the
taxation
of
intangibles
was
eliminated
completely
except
for,
i
think,
insurance
company.
as
far
--
now,
the
reference
in
the
statute,
in
the
sentence
in
section
2
is,
i
submit
nothing
more
than
a
legislative
declaration
that
as
of
this
time
or
as
of
the
time
of
the
introduction
of
the
act
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
continued
to
date,
that
no
intangibles
owned
by
corporation
should
be
assessed.
now,
justice
burling
for
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
referred
to
that
section,
specifically
at
the
end
of
his
opinion
and
pointed
out
that
that
particular
sentence
recognized
the
legislative
policy
at
that
time
not
to
tax
intangibles
of
corporations.
the
fact
is
that
we
haven't
attempted
to
tax
the
intangibles
of
individuals
yet,
but
that,
i
submit,
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
legislature.
however,
the
--
the
--
that
statement
by
the
legislature
does
not
at
all
i
submit
affect
the
fact
that
the
act
itself
expressly
levies
the
tax
not
on
property
but
on
the
corporate
privilege,
the
very
mechanics
to
the
act
is
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
fact
that
the
penalties
available,
the
penalties
to
be
incurred
for
failure
to
pay
the
tax
are
the
termination
of
--
or
this
enjoining
of
corporate
existence,
everything
in
the
act,
the
fact
that
the
act
is
the
only
substitute
that
we
have
for
corporate
franchise
taxes
in
new
jersey.
all
that
i
submit
is
additional
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
act
is
exactly
what
it
purports
to
be
and
what
the
statute
and
what
the
court
--
our
courts
of
our
state
have
found
--
have
held
indeed.
mr.
harold
kolovsky
pardon?
mr.
harold
kolovsky
that's
part
of
the
same
act.
i
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
except
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
--
except
--
pardon,
sir,
except
--
i
think
there
were
couple
of
amendments
which
were
added
but
i
don't
think
they
could
be
anything
to
judge
this.
mr.
harold
kolovsky
--
definitions
which
were
added.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
kolovsky
that
was
part
at
the
same
time.
there
had
been
a
slight
modification
in
language
but
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
harold
kolovsky
well,
no,
in
that
--
but
the
net
worth
is
not
limited,
justice
reed,
to
--
or
the
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
i
think
it
includes
--
certainly
includes
all
assets
of
the
corporation
and
includes
all
lessor
liabilities
to
the
corporation.
there's
no
question
of
that
--
mr.
harold
kolovsky
--
in
--
in
computing
that
and
using
that
as
the
measure
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
tax.
i
would
suggest
that
any
measure
based
on
whether
it
would
be
income,
net
worth
or
property
necessarily
reflects
in
--
in
computing
the
measurement,
reflects
--
there
is
some
incident
of
fact
of
the
underlying
asset
itself
or
the
underlying
income
itself,
but
that
does
not
affect
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
item
being
taxed
is
the
privilege.
after
all
i
think
it's
been
well
settled
in
more
than
a
hundred
years
of
decisions
of
this
court
that
where
the
privilege
being
taxed
is
a
legitimate
subject
of
taxation
that
the
fact
that
it
happens
to
be
as
measured
by
net
income
or
net
property
which
could
not
be
taxed
directly
because
it
included
federal
income
of
--
or
federal
bonds
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
a
tax.
and
i
think
it
necessarily
has
to
be
so
because
then
the
impact
is
--
is
much
less.
basically
--
basically,
i
submit
that
in
the
use
of
formula,
the
net
worth
formula,
which
incidentally
is
in
use,
i
am
told
in
somewhat
over
25%
of
the
states
of
this
country
is
a
--
it
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
reasonable
legislative
determination
of
a
form
of
measurement
of
the
potential
of
the
corporate
franchise.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
course,
our
act
as
does
the
acts
of
other
states
provides
an
allocation
formula
where
the
corporation
act
is
in
more
than
one
state.
of
course,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
werner
machine
company,
werner
manufacturing
company
is
a
completely
new
jersey
corporation.
there's
no
claim
here
that
it
has
any
activity
of
any
kind
outside
of
new
jersey.
the
suggestion
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
appellant
this
morning
that
this
court
has
never
upheld
a
measurement
based
on
net
worth.
i
submit
that
that's
hardly
accurate.
the
ford
motor
company
against
beauchamp
case,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
case
arising
out
of
the
state
of
texas,
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
where
there
was
a
corporate
franchise
tax
measured
by
net
worth
and
the
act
was
upheld.
now,
it's
true
that
the
particular
objection
they
urged
was
not
that
in
the
measurement
of
federal
bonds
were
included,
but
that
it
was
improper
burden
on
it
to
state
commerce,
but
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
sufficiency
or
the
proprietary
of
the
formula.
also,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
in
the
two
cases
arising
out
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
which
we
refer
to
at
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
commonwealth
against
the
ford
motor
company
and
commonwealth
against
quaker
oats
company
in
which
the
appeals
were
dismissed
in
this
--
in
this
court.
in
those
cases,
the
--
what
was
used
were
substantially
a
net
worth
formula
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
know
that
in
--
in
dismissing
the
appeal,
this
court
referred
to
and
cited
flint
against
stone
tracy
company
and
the
educational
films
case,
both
of
which
together
with
the
tradesmen
bank
against
oklahoma,
which
we
also
refer
to
is
about
--
about
the
latest
reiteration
of
the
rule
which
i
say
is
settled
in
this
court.
as
to
distinction
between
a
property
tax
on
federal
instrumentalities
and
a
tax
on
a
privilege
measured
by
net
income
or
net
property,
which
might
include
federal
income
or
income
from
federal
securities
or
federal
bonds.
the
gravamen,
i
submit,
of
the
appellant's
argument
seems
to
be
that
this
case
is
contrary
or
it
should
be
governed
by
new
jersey
realty
company
case.
the
new
jersey
realty
company
case
was
a
property
tax
case.
the
--
the
very
section
of
the
act
involved
was
a
section
of
our
local
property
tax
law
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
neither
this
court
or
neither
the
state
court
nor
the
administrative
agencies
at
anytime
considered
that
that
was
a
franchise
tax.
it
wasn't.
it
was
a
tax
on
the
capital
or
the
net
worth
of
the
corporation.
the
suggestion
was
made
this
morning
without
the
slightest
support
in
the
proof
or
in
fact
that
the
administrative
agencies
in
new
jersey
have
treated
this
present
act,
the
act
that
we
have
here
before
us
as
a
property
tax
law.
that
finds
no
support
anywhere.
the
fact
is
that
the
return,
the
form
of
the
return,
the
statute
itself,
everything
concerned
with
it
shows
that
it
is
treated.
it's
what
in
fact
it
is.
it's
treated
not
only
by
the
administrative
agencies
but
by
the
courts
in
new
jersey
as
a
franchise
tax.
reference
was
also
made
this
morning
to
the
schuylkill
against
pennsylvania
case.
but
a
reading
of
that
case
discloses
that
what
was
found
wrong
with
the
--
in
that
case
was
that
there
was
discrimination
against
income
from
federal
bonds
because
--
but
the
other
income
was
--
in
that
case
as
appears
from
the
appellant's
own
brief,
there
was
a
tax
on
shares
of
a
state
trust
company
measured
by
the
value
of
the
companies
net
assets
excluding
however
shares
of
stock
held
by
it
and
corporations
which
pay
the
pennsylvania
capital
stock
tax
or
the
tax
on
shares
that
were
expressly
exempted
by
pennsylvania
from
such
taxes
and
federal
securities
were
not
so
excluded.
so
that
there
you
had
a
deliberate
discrimination
against
federal,
against
federal
instrumentalities
and
the
income
therefrom.
now,
the
suggestion
is
made
or
it's
made
rather
strongly
in
the
appellant's
brief.
they'll
not
press
here
in
oral
argument
that
our
franchise
tax
law
was
--
falls
within
the
doctrine
of
the
mcculloch
case
as
a
deliberate
attempt
to
reach
federal
securities.
the
appellant
has
apparently
withdrawn
from
that
position
in
his
oral
argument.
i
submit
it
has
absolutely
no
justification.
of
course,
the
mcculloch
case
itself
has
been
criticized
by
this
court
whatever
its
present
validity
may
be.
the
fact
is
however
that
in
the
mcculloch
case,
there
was
one
isolated
change
in
their
franchise
tax
law
to
expressly
include
income
from
federal
securities.
there
can
be
no
basis
for
that
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
had
a
complete
revision
of
our
corporation
franchise
tax
law.
the
substitute
for
the
measurement
theretofore
based
on
the
number
of
shares
of
stock
issued
and
outstanding,
the
measurement
based
on
net
worth
is
provided
in
the
statute.
and
so
i
submit
that
i
need
not
burden
this
court
by
repeating
at
length
the
quotations
from
the
opinions
of
this
court
which
we've
set
forth
in
this
--
in
our
brief.
but
that
fundamentally,
we
have
shown
clearly
that
our
1945
act
is
factually
and
in
fact
what
it
purports
to
be,
what
our
courts
have
held
it
to
be
a
franchise
tax
act
and
that
the
fact
that
it's
measured
by
net
worth
does
not
affect
its
validity
and
that
under
the
central
law
of
this
court
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
