frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
--
by
that
latter
statement,
do
you
mean
if
you
can
create
the
effect
of
holding
government
securities,
so
that
you
can
demonstrate
that
it
makes
a
dollar-and-cent
difference
because
they
held
government
bonds
--
bonds
instead
of
general
motor
stock,
is
that
what
you
mean?
that
if
you
just
can
create
a
monetary
incident
using
the
fact
that
you
--
absent
to
the
corporation
or
a
government
bond,
is
that
what
you
mean?
