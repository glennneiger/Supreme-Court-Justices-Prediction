mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
tax
case,
new
jersey
franchise
tax.
question
presented
arises,
however,
under
the
united
states
constitution.
it's
the
position
of
the
appellant
that
the
new
jersey
franchise
tax
here
imposed
was
excessive
to
the
extent
that
it
took
into
its
measure
tax-exempt
federal
obligations.
werner
machine
company,
the
appellant,
is
a
new
jersey
corporation
doing
business
only
in
new
jersey.
it
complains
here
that
in
practical
operation
in
effect,
a
franchise
tax
that
it
paid
to
the
--
so-called
franchise
tax
i
might
say
that
it
paid
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
the
year
1952
is
a
tax
upon
tax-exempt
federal
obligations.
the
tax
here
in
question
was
for
the
year
1952
but
it
was
based
upon
the
net
worth
of
the
appellant
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
year,
december
31,
1951.
net
worth
as
long
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
the
equivalent
of
net
assets.
now,
at
december
31,
1951,
the
appellant
owned
some
$400,000
of
federal
obligations
which
were
concededly
exempt
from
tax
by
the
state.
however,
the
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
measured
by
net
assets
did
not
afford
any
mechanics
for
excluding
from
the
net
assets
or
net
worth
of
the
appellant
these
tax-exempt
federal
obligations
and
its
tax
payment
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
was
thereby
increased
because
it
owned
this
bond
by
some
$320.
the
tax
was
paid
under
protest,
refund
was
properly
sought,
the
new
jersey
division
of
tax
appeals
rejected
the
appellant's
claim
that
this
tax
was
not
properly
due.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
$320
for
that
year.
it's
a
recurring
item
which
might
come
up
every
year
and
i
believe
that
might
affect
other
corporations.
it
applies
--
this
tax
applies
equally
to
domestic
and
foreign
corporations.
there's
no
distinction
in
the
statute
which
imposes
the
tax.
the
taxing
act
is
called
the
corporation
business
tax
act
of
1945,
it
purports
to
impose
a
franchise
tax
on
domestic
and
foreign
corporations
for
the
exercise
of
several
privileges.
the
taxing
act
is
--
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
appellant's
brief
at
page
16
and
following
and
the
initial
section
which
is
the
section
actually
imposing
the
tax
provide
that
every
domestic
or
foreign
corporation
not
hereinafter
exempted
shall
pay
an
annual
franchise
tax
for
the
year
1946
and
each
year
thereafter
as
herein
after
provided
for
the
privilege
of
having
or
exercising
its
corporate
franchise
in
this
state
or
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business,
employing
or
owning
capital
or
property,
or
maintaining
an
office
in
this
state
and
such
franchise
tax
shall
be
in
lieu
of
all
other
state,
county,
or
local
taxation
upon
or
measured
by
intangible
personal
property
used
in
business
by
corporations
liable
to
taxation
under
this
act.
i
think
at
this
point
a
little
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
--
yes,
i'll
have
to
clarify.
the
preceding
sentence
i
think
is
of
considerable
significance
because
it
imposes
the
tax
not
only
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
but
also
for
the
privilege
of
mere
employing
or
owning
property.
franchise
taxes
customarily
have
been
imposed
only
on
corporations
doing
business,
this
tax
goes
beyond
that,
it
poses
the
tax
for
the
privilege
of
mere
idle
ownership
of
property.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
claiming
that
this
is
not
in
substance
a
franchise
tax
that
in
practical
operation
and
effect,
it
imposes
a
burden
on
the
tax-exempt
bond
unless
hinders
the
borrowing
power,
even
though
it
might
be
designated
a
franchise
tax.does
that
say
that
a
franchise
tax
based
on
the
assets
of
the
corporation
which
included
50%
of
government
bonds
that
they
could
not
be
accommodated?
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
this
court
has
never
specifically
held
in
the
straight
franchise
tax
that
such
a
tax
would
be
proper,
although
there
are
dicta
of
the
court
indicating
that
it
would
be
permissible.
however,
i
think
that
if
this
court
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
that
in
practical
operation
and
effect
it's
a
tax
on
the
government
bonds.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
because
of
that
in
part
and
also
because
it
is
imposed
for
the
mere
privilege
of
owning
property.
now,
i
don't
think
that
a
tax
imposed
on
the
privilege
of
owning
property,
idle
ownerships
is
any
different
than
the
--
than
a
property
tax.
i
think
we
have
two
things
here.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
corporation
under
this
statute
would
be
taxed
if
it
had,
say,
$10,000
in
the
bank
in
a
non-interest
bearing
account
and
nothing
else.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
would
be
essentially
a
property
tax.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
in
part
is
it.
the
history
of
the
act
indicates
that
this
is
in
lieu
of
property
taxes.
but
it's
the
contention
of
the
appellant
here
that
not
only
in
--
in
lieu
of
a
property
tax,
in
fact
it
is
a
property
tax.
and
secondly,
even
if
it
--
that
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
material
whether
we
call
it
a
franchise
tax
or
a
property
tax.
but
under
the
new
jersey
realty
decision
of
this
court
in
1950,
if
in
practical
operation
and
effect
it
burdens
the
bonds,
then
it
must
--
then
it's
bad.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
i
would
argue
that
in
this
particular
case,
i
don't
need
to
go
that
far.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
yes,
there
is.
interestingly
enough,
a
precise
situation
is
here,
although
it
wasn't
here
in
1945
when
the
act
was
originally
enacted
but
it
came
into
the
act
about
2
years
later.
a
survey
was
made
and
it
was
ascertained
that
certain
property
within
the
state
was
escaping
--
was
not
bearing
its
fair
share
of
the
burden.
and
therefore
an
alternative
was
added
and
that
was
designed
to
catch
corporations
with
very
substantial
assets
and
not
much
taxable
net
worth
and
that
alternative
tax
is
based
--
well
there's
two
alternatives,
one
is
important
in
large
corporations,
one,
it's
smaller,
both
those
in
(inaudible)
the
alternatives
are
based
upon
assets
and
not
net
worth.
now,
the
only
difference
and
i
think
it
--
it
isn't
a
difference,
i
think
it's
a
rearrangement
between
the
new
jersey
realty
situation
and
the
one
here
is
that
the
alternatives
are
in
reverse
order.
in
new
jersey
realty,
there
was
a
tax
on
property
and
there
wasn't
any
taxable
property,
then
an
alternative
tax
is
not
less
than
15%
of
net
worth.
here,
there's
a
tax
on
net
worth
and
the
net
worth
doesn't
bring
down
much
tax
than
an
alternative
tax
at
a
much
lower
rate
on
gross
assets.
and
in
both
cases,
the
case
here
and
the
new
jersey
realty
case,
the
higher
of
the
two
taxes
was
properly
due
and
owing.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
order
in
which
the
computation
is
made
is
significant
at
all.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
i
think
the
alternative
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
--
the
alternative
was
15%
of
net
worth.
i
--
i
don't
think
there
was
any
mention
there
with
--
that
it
was
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would
for
the
privilege
of
--
however,
the
statute
did
provide
--
the
new
jersey
realty
was
a
somewhat
limited
statute
than
it
applied
to
insurance
companies,
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
material
distinction
either
and
it
did
provide
in
conclusion,
no
franchise
tax
shall
be
imposed
upon
any
insurance
company
included
in
the
statute.
so
that
it
was
in
lieu
of
a
franchise
tax
and
therefore
i
think
for
the
privilege
of
exercising
the
franchise.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
that's
right.
one
of
the
alternatives
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
one
of
the
alternatives
was
a
property
tax,
i
think
by
its
very
terms.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
which
the
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
in
the
new
jersey
realty.
yes,
they
did.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
such
a
distinction
has
been
--
has
been
mentioned.
it's
never
--
there's
never
been
a
decision
upholding
any
such
distinction
in
a
case
of
tax-exempt
federal
obligations.
most
of
the
decisions
along
that
line
were
interstate
commerce
cases.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
cases
i
think
are
different
because
this
court
has
held
that
no
unreasonable
burden
can
be
placed
upon
the
interstate
commerce.
here,
we
have
a
constitution
and
revised
statute
section
3701,
which
i
haven't
mentioned
specifically
yet,
which
say
no
burden
at
all
can
be
imposed
upon
the
tax-exempt
obligations.
any
burden
at
all
that
hinders
the
borrowing
power
is
--
is
invalid,
it
causes
the
tax
to
be
stricken
down.
now,
new
jersey
realty
said
that
we'll
look
through
the
label
that's
put
on
the
tax,
that
it
matters
not
whether
we
call
it
a
property
tax
or
a
franchise
tax,
that
the
question
that
must
be
decided
by
this
court
is
whether
in
practical
operation
and
effect
it
imposes
a
burden
on
the
tax-exempt
federal
obligations.
this
particular
tax,
the
business
corporation
tax
of
1945
has
an
interesting
historical
background.
before
1946,
new
jersey
collected
most
of
its
income
on
a
property
tax
base,
the
tax
applying
to
real
property
and
to
intangible
or
rather
personal
property
and
including
intangible
personal
property.
there
was
also
a
capital
stock
tax
imposed
upon
corporations
but
it
was
measured
by
the
number
of
shares
of
power
or
nominal
value
of
outstanding
stock
and
it
was
not
the
type
of
tax
we
now
have.
in
other
words,
it
--
it
bid
upon
the
capital
structure
rather
than
--
than
on
the
size
of
the
net
worth
or
assets.
in
1944,
new
jersey
legislature
appointed
a
commission,
the
commission
for
the
taxation
of
intangible
personal
property,
and
it's
function
was
to
examine
into
the
difficulties
and
i
believe
inequities
which
were
arising
under
the
then
existing
system,
taxation.
the
joint
resolution
appointing
the
committee
as
paragraph
number
one
indicates,
be
it
resolved
by
the
senate
and
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
there
is
hereby
created
a
commission
to
investigate
the
question
of
evaluation
and
taxation
of
intangible
personal
property
and
related
tax
subjects.
interestingly
enough,
the
--
that
commission
came
up
with
the
recommendation
for
a
franchise
tax.
it
--
the
report
--
i
understand
that
there
will
be
copies,
sufficient
copies
of
its
complete
report
for
the
members
of
the
court.
we
quoted
part
of
it
in
our
appendix
to
the
reply
brief
but
it
analyzed
the
then
difficulties
with
the
intangible
personal
property
tax
in
new
jersey.
corporations
then
doing
business
in
new
jersey
were
subject
to
a
risk
or
hazard
which
was
called
tax
lightning.
basically,
the
law
then
provided
that
intangibles
were
subject
to
tax
at
their
full
value
at
the
same
rates
as
real
property.
in
actual
practice,
corporations
were
not
paying
the
full
tax
on
all
intangible
personal
property
owned
by
long
custom,
the
tax
was
imposed
only
on
certain
limited
classes
of
intangible
personal
property.
but
occasionally,
local
taxing
authorities
would
come
into
the
office
of
a
corporation,
value
the
intangible
personal
property
and
demand
the
full
tax
which
was
--
imposed
a
very
high
burden
and
not
--
did
not
operate
fairly.
as
a
result,
a
great
many
holding
companies
and
other
large
corporations
settled
in
one
community,
flemington,
where
administration
of
the
tax
promised
to
be
fair
and
just
and
the
large
assembly
of
corporations
with
the
vast
amounts
of
personal
property
held
kept
the
rate
at
a
very
low
figure.
in
other
words,
a
great
many
of
them
got
together
in
a
small
new
jersey
community
to
share
the
burdens
of
that
community.
in
1945,
the
commission
on
taxation
of
intangible
personal
property
submitted
its
report
to
the
new
jersey
legislature
and
it's
on
the
basis
of
that
report
that
the
present
--
the
tax
act
now
before
this
court
was
enacted.
it's
first
recommendation
from
the
conclusion
of
the
report
is
as
follows,
commission
unanimously
recommends
first
that
the
present
methods
of
taxing
intangible
personal
property
be
abandoned.
appellant
takes
the
position
that
it's
significant
that
there's
no
intent
there
to
abandon
the
taxation
of
personal
property
but
only
the
present
methods
of
taxation.
the
commission
transmitted
its
report
to
the
governor
and
members
of
the
legislature
with
a
cover
letter
of
transmittal
which
summarizes
the
purposes
and
recommendations
and
it
is
significant
in
that
--
it
states
what
the
commission
believes
its
purpose
was.
the
commission's
purpose
therefore
has
been
two-fold,
to
remove
the
threat
of
what
is
commonly
called
tax
lightning
from
intangible
personal
property
and
to
provide
a
sound
base
through
which
a
substantial
amount
of
this
property
now
legally
taxable
but
untaxed
can
be
reached
for
tax
purposes.
this
indicates
that
it
was
the
commission's
understanding
that
they
were
to
come
up
with
a
new
law
which
would
reach
intangible
personal
property
for
tax
purposes.
in
the
conclusion
of
the
report,
the
recommendations
which
the
commission
made
to
the
legislature,
proposal
number
two
was
adopted
by
the
legislature
and
is
part
of
the
law
now
in
effect.
proposal
number
two
made
to
the
commission
and
approved
by
the
commission
is
that
intangible
personal
property
be
exempted
from
taxation.
the
commission,
for
a
reason
stated
in
the
text,
concludes
that
intangible
personal
property
be
exempted
entirely
from
taxation
under
a
property
tax,
provided
that
the
present
taxable
base
now
threatened
by
tax
lightning
be
made
to
bear
its
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
government
in
some
other
way.
that
indicates
a
clear
intention
to
reach
personal
property
to
carry
its
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
government
under
the
amended
law.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
could
read
the
report
of
this
commission
as
commission
on
the
taxation
of
intangible
personal
property
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
its
purpose
was
to
bring
the
new
jersey
tax
on
intangible
personal
property
up
to
date,
so
that
the
tax
would
reach
the
intangible
personal
property
owned
by
corporations
and
that
--
that
all
of
that
intangible
personal
property
would
be
reported
and
subjected
to
the
tax.
incidentally,
this
commission
was
--
the
chairman
of
this
commission
was
professor
john
f.
sly
of
princeton
but
we
thought
it
might
be
unwise
to
refer
to
this
report
as
the
sly
report
in
fear
it
might
--
we
might
be
accused
of
impugning
its
motives.
the
statute
was
enacted
as
recommended
by
this
commission
in
1945
effective
for
tax
years
1946
and
subsequent
and
it
followed
the
commission
regulations.
there
were
two
companion
measures
that
went
through
it
at
the
same
time,
the
corporation
business
tax
act
and
the
repeal
of
the
old
intangible
personal
property
tax.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
not
at
all,
they
did
--
they
were
reaching
not
particularly
for
government
bonds
but
for
all
intangibles
including
government
bonds.
under
the
old
law,
not
only
government
bonds
were
escaping
tax
but
also
a
great
many
intangibles
which
could
properly
be
taxed
because
of
the
improper
enforcement.
now,
government
bonds
are
listed
by
the
commission,
they
are
included
in
a
long
list
of
--
of
properties
corporations
own,
and
the
commission
recognized
that
this
tax
would
reach,
indirectly
they
thought,
government
bonds.
but
it
is
not
designed
just
to
reach
government
bonds,
it's
designed
to
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
they
think
that
it
is
a
tax
stated
to
be
on
the
privilege
of
exercising
the
corporate
franchise,
not
a
tax
on
the
bonds,
only
measured
by
the
bonds.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
yes,
i'm
here
to
argue
about
that.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
if
it's
a
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
if
--
if
the
franchise
tax,
even
though
it's
a
franchise
tax,
in
practical
operation
and
effect
imposed
as
a
tax
on
the
government
bonds,
i
think
this
court
held
in
new
jersey
realty
that
it's
invalid.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
if
it's
a
tax
on
net
worth
as
this
tax
is,
then
i
think
in
practical
operation
and
effect
it's
a
tax
on
the
bonds.
corporations
customarily
invest
surplus
assets
in
governments
or
other
frequently
idle
funds.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
ownership
of
government
bonds
bears
particularly
on
the
benefits
of
exercising
the
corporate
franchise.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
then
i
think
it
would
avoid
the
tax,
this
type
of
tax,
this
net
worth
tax.
there
is
an
alternative
on
gross
assets
and
i
think
it
would
--
would
be
subject
to
tax.
well,
of
course
gross
assets
there
would
be
no
tax.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
mere
ownership
of
government
bonds
is
doing
business
within
this
meaning.i
think
necessarily
if
a
corporation
has
nothing
but
government
bonds,
its
only
asset,
then
any
franchise
tax
measured
by
assets
is
a
tax
on
those
government
bonds.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
they
--
states
--
most
states
and
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
new
jersey
customarily
have
an
alternative
minimum
franchise
tax.
they
provide
that
every
corporation,
new
jersey
corporation,
for
example,
which
has
a
franchise
from
the
state,
if
it
doesn't
--
if
it
isn't
subjected
to
an
annual
tax
under
other
alternatives,
it
pays
the
minimum.
that
may
not
be
the
case
in
new
jersey
as
it
is
in
new
york,
there's
a
minimum
tax
of
--
when
all
the
other
methods
fail
to
reach
a
corporation.
and
that
i
think
is
the
type
of
tax
that
measures
the
idle
possession
of
the
franchise,
even
though
all
the
assets
might
be
in
government
bonds.
the
--
for
instance,
the
taxing
rate
might
be
higher
than
the
income
on
the
government,
in
which
case
the
only
way
the
corporation
could
pay
its
franchise
tax
would
be
to
annually
sell
off
some
of
the
principal
each
year
to
get
money
to
pay
the
tax,
clearly
a
tax
on
the
bond.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
8
mils?
i'm
not
sure
of
the
amount
in
1952
whether
it
was
an
8
mil
tax.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
eight-tenths
of
a
mil
--
eight-tenths
of
a
mil
on
net
worth.
the
alternative
tax
was
one
quarter
of
that
on
gross
assets
or
two-tenths
of
a
mil.
i
think
last
year
the
tax
was
multiplied
two-and-a-half
times
or
something
like
that,
no
reason
why
it
couldn't
be
increased
substantially
at
any
time.
i
think
if
they
can
reach
the
government
bonds,
then
the
rate
is
within
the
--
the
discretion
of
the
state.
i
mentioned
briefly
in
reply
to
a
question
that
in
1947,
after
the
tax
had
been
in
operation
for
one
full
year,
a
report
of
the
commission
on
state
tax
policy
recommended
amendments
to
reach
the
situation
where
corporations
with
substantial
property,
intangible
personal
property
and
so
forth
were
not
bearing
their
fair
share
of
the
state
tax
burden
because
not
having
much
taxable
net
worth.
and
at
that
time,
they
added
the
two
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
about
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
first,
this
morning
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
two
alternatives
each
mentioned
yesterday
on
which
the
appellant
rests
his
case.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
the
position
of
the
appellant
here
that
this
tax
now
before
this
court
is
a
property
tax.
the
legislative
history
preceding
the
enactment
of
this
act,
the
report
on
which
it
is
based
and
particularly
within
the
act
itself,
the
alternative
taxes
upon
which
the
tax
may
be
computed
based
upon
gross
assets
rather
than
net
worth
indicate
very
strongly
that
this
is
in
fact
a
property
tax.
our
alternative
argument
is
based
upon
the
practical
operation
and
effect
test,
which
was
recently
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
the
new
jersey
realty
case
in
the
following
language.
it
matters
not
whether
the
tax
is
as
appellant
--
appellee
contends
an
indirect
or
excised
levy
on
net
worth
measured
by
corporate,
capital
and
surplus
or
is,
as
appellant
urges,
a
tax
on
personal
property
based
on
evaluation
gauged
by
capital
and
surplus.
our
inquiry
is
narrowed
to
whether
in
practical
operation
in
effect,
the
tax
is
in
part
upon
federal
bonds.
we
can
only
conclude
that
the
tax
authorized
by
section
54-422
whether
levied
against
capital
and
surplus
less
liabilities
or
against
entire
net
worth
is
imposed
on
such
securities
regardless
of
the
accounting
label
employed
in
describing
it.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
i
think
perfectly
valid.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
not
at
all,
they
do
have
such
a
tax
which
we're
not
complaining
about.
there
are
alternative
minimum
taxes
with
a
flat
rate.
i
think
it's
only
when
the
government
--
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
--
bonds
enter
into
the
basis
of
computation
that
we
run
into
this
burden
on
the
borrowing
power.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
very
strongly.
i
think
it's
most
significant
that
this
court
has
never
upheld
any
tax
measured
by
net
worth
against
the
contention
that
such
a
tax
has
reached
federal
obligations.
section
9
of
--
of
the
particular
taxing
act
here
under
consideration
also
points
directly
toward
the
property
nature
of
this
tax.
section
9
allows
a
corporate
taxpayer
subject
to
the
tax,
a
deduction
in
respect
of
stock
of
subsidiaries
owned
if
those
subsidiaries
or
the
subsidiary
pays
a
new
jersey
tax.
this
deduction
recognizes
that
the
imposition
of
a
tax
measured
in
part
by
a
corporation
already
taxed
would
be
double
taxation.
and
this
double
taxation
aspect
is
specifically
pointed
out
in
the
1947
report
of
the
new
jersey
commission
on
state
tax
policy.
the
same
or
a
similar
situation
was
presented
to
this
court
in
schuylkill
trust
case
reported
in
296
u.s.
in
that
case,
pennsylvania
imposed
a
tax
on
shareholders
of
banks.
it
was
a
tax
on
the
shareholder
not
the
corporation.
but
in
computing
the
value
of
the
stock
of
the
bank
subject
to
the
tax,
the
shareholder
was
permitted
the
deduction
with
respect
to
securities
of
corporations
owned
by
the
bank
if
they
paid
a
pennsylvania
tax
and
very
similar
to
the
situation
here.
and
this
court
struck
down
that
tax
and
stated
as
follows.
the
state
has
exempted
certain
assets
on
the
theory
that
to
measure
the
tax
in
part
by
their
value
would
in
effect
be
to
tax
them
twice.
if
to
measure
the
shareholders
tax
by
inclusion
of
these
taxed
or
exempted
securities
found
amongst
the
company's
assets,
it
would
be
to
tax
the
shareholder
in
virtue
of
the
company's
ownership
of
those
securities.
it
seems
clear
that
to
refuse
to
exempt
united
states
securities
from
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
to
lay
a
tax
reckoned
upon
their
value.
the
new
jersey
taxing
authorities
themselves
in
the
administration
of
this
particular
tax
also
recognized
that
it's
--
by
its
nature
of
property
tax.
in
the
first
place,
the
return
itself
requires
that
in
the
computation
of
the
“net
worth”,
the
assets
marketable
securities
rather
owned
by
the
corporate
taxpayer
must
be
included
at
their
fair
market
value
rather
than
their
book
value.
thus,
we
find
that
the
taxing
authorities
themselves
have
gone
to
the
less
side
or
asset
side
of
the
balance
sheet
in
computing
this
tax,
had
gone
and
looked
specifically
at
these
government
bonds.
they
haven't
confined
their
attention
to
the
liability
side
of
the
balance
sheet
where
we
customarily
find
net
worth
computed.
they
are
going
right
after
the
property
itself.
another
instance
of
the
recognition
by
the
taxing
authorities
of
the
property
nature
of
this
tax
followed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
spector
case.
now,
in
the
spector
case,
it
was
held
that
a
connecticut
franchise
tax
could
not
reach
a
foreign
corporation
doing
solely
interstate
business.
and
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
striking
down
that
tax,
it
was
mentioned
specifically
that
the
tax
there
was
not
a
property
tax
or
in
lieu
of
a
property
tax.
thereafter,
the
question
came
up
as
to
whether
that
decision
required
any
difference
in
the
administration
of
this
new
jersey
tax
here
at
issue.
and
the
supervisor
of
the
new
jersey
corporation
tax
bureau
officially
ruled
that
the
spector
decision
had
no
application
to
the
new
jersey
tax
here
before
this
court.
and
i,
“furthermore,
the
new
jersey
statute
expressly
provides
that
the
said
tax
is
in
lieu
of
a
property
tax.
it
is
significant
that
in
the
spector
case
decision,
the
majority
opinion
emphasizes
the
fact
that
the
connecticut
tax
was
not
in
lieu
of
a
property
tax.”
in
conclusion,
the
appellant
here
urges
the
reversal
of
the
court
below,
the
decision
below,
on
the
ground
that
the
tax
here
in
question
is
either
a
property
tax
or
is
a
tax
imposed
in
practical
operation
and
effect
on
federal
obligations.
in
either
event,
it
imposes
a
--
a
direct
burden
on
the
borrowing
power
of
the
federal
government
in
violation
of
revised
statute
section
3710.
mr.
charles
goodwin,
jr.
counsel
for
the
appellee
indicates
that
there
have
been
cases
of
this
court,
apparently
many
of
them
supporting
the
measurement
of
such
tax
by
net
worth.
i
would
like
to
state
that
we've
been
unable
to
find
a
single
case
supporting
that
proposition
where
this
argument
here
was
raised.
interstate
commerce
clause
is
a
different
proposition
because
there
it's
been
held
the
burden
must
be
reasonable,
no
more
than
reasonable.
here,
there
can
be
no
burden
on
the
federal
borrowing
power.
the
flint
against
stone
tracy
case
was
mentioned.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
predecessor
to
the
federal
income
tax.
it
was
in
the
nature
of
an
income
tax,
back
in
1911
and
1909.
but
it
followed
the
pattern
of
cases
on
the
interstate
commerce
in
similar
cases
and
the
quote
in
the
appellee's
brief
on
page
15
is
most
significant
when
it's
compared
with
the
statute
here
under
consideration
because
it's
mentioned
by
this
court
that
in
the
present
case,
that's
flint
against
stone
tracy,
the
tax
is
not
payable
unless
there
be
a
carrying
on
or
doing
of
business
in
the
designated
capacity
and
this
has
made
the
occasion
for
the
tax
measured
by
the
standard
prescribed.
the
difference
between
the
acts
is
not
merely
nominal,
but
rests
upon
--
upon
substantial
differences
between
the
mere
ownership
of
property
and
the
actual
doing
of
business
in
a
certain
way
of
the
new
jersey
statute
here
in
question
imposes
the
tax
in
the
alternative
upon
the
doing
of
business
or
standing
alone
the
mere
ownership
of
property.
the
ford
cases,
well,
ford
and
quaker
oats
case
in
pennsylvania,
there
was
an
alternative
there
also
measured
by
assets,
gross
assets.
it
was
not
strictly
a
net
worth
tax
and
i
don't
think
that
--
that
the
failure
of
this
court
to
hear
and
reverse
that
is
--
is
in
any
way
controlling.
thank
you.
