justice

as
to
the
last
sentence,
it's
the
significant
sentence,
is
it
not,
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
--
what
your
argument
here
is
that
this
is
not
a
franchise
tax?
justice
stanley
reed
and
that's
because
it
relieves
them
of
all
of
the
taxes
that
aren't
intangible?
justice
stanley
reed
franchise
to
be
a
holding
company
and
hold
assets,
you
don't
think
that
would
be
a
good
franchise?
justice
stanley
reed
and
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
that
be
a
franchise
for
holding?
i'm
just
trying
to
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
--
that's
because
of
the
license,
isn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
what
is
the
amount
of
the
tax
here?
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
am
--
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
this
is
the
only
tax
levied
against
the
property
of
the
corporation?
justice
stanley
reed
is
that
put
in
to
your
brief?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
says
except
as
otherwise
provided.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
the
reason
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
the
reason
i
asked
was
on
account
of
the
quotation
to
54:10a-2
that
the
appellant
has
here,
which
--
which
says,
as
i
read
it,
such
franchise
tax
will
be
in
lieu
of
all
of
the
state
county
or
local
taxation
upon
or
measured
by
intangible
personal
property.
justice
stanley
reed
and
that
this
--
justice
stanley
reed
now,
10a-2
and
10a-4
i
suppose
were
passed
at
the
same
time.
justice
stanley
reed
10a-2
and
10a-4
were
passed
at
the
same
time.
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
in
relieving
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
the
only
--
justice
stanley
reed
10a-(d)
--
10a-4
(d)
is
the
only
--
justice
stanley
reed
so
when
they
eliminated
the
tax
on
the
intangibles,
they
placed
the
franchise
tax
based
on
those
intangibles
including
with
other
assets
of
the
corporation.
justice
stanley
reed
not
limited
to
intangibles
but
necessarily
includes
intangibles,
does
it
not?
justice
stanley
reed
so
