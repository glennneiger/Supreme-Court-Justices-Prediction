justice
harold
burton
you
referred
to
the
new
jersey
realty
case.
in
that
case
there
was
a
minimum
--
a
minimum
requirement
apart
from
the
net
worth
proposition,
was
there
not,
said
in
--
in
any
event
it
cannot
be
less
than
15%
and
thereby
necessarily
caught
government
bonds.
there's
nothing
like
that
here,
isn't
it?
justice
harold
burton
did
that
commission
give
any
consideration
to
the
fact
that
if
they
did
reach
intangible
government
bond
that
they
--
that
it
would
be
an
invalid
tax
on
them?
justice
harold
burton
but
if
they
thought
it
would
reach,
then
indirectly
how
did
they
think
they
could
do
it
constitutionally?
justice
harold
burton
so
therefore
they
were
drawing
on
the
state's
theory
of
a
franchise
tax
and
not
a
property
tax?s
justice
harold
burton
well,
if
it
is
a
franchise
tax,
why
is
it
--
it's
--
it's
valid,
there's
no
argument
about
that,
is
it?
justice
harold
burton
even
though
it's
a
franchise
tax,
a
bona
fide
franchise
--
justice
harold
burton
--
tax
can't
be
measured
by
--
by
the
net
worth
including
these
bonds.
justice
harold
burton
you
mean
then
any
kind
of
a
franchise
tax,
they
may
figure
out
has
got
--
also
has
some
paragraph
say
but
you
mustn't
take
into
consideration
the
government
bonds
and
--
in
--
in
determining
the
basis
of
the
tax.
