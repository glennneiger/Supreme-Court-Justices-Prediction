mr.
victor
m.
harding
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
fill
in
a
few
more
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
have
not
been
brought
out
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
this
is
a
case
that
involves
liability
under
an
automobile
liability
insurance
policy.
the
policy
contains
a
provision
by
reason
of
his
endorsement
that
it
should
not
be
in
effect
if
the
car
were
driven
by
any
member
of
the
armed
forces
other
than
the
name
insured
or
while
the
name
insured
is
in
the
car.
now,
i
would
like
to
bring
out
the
facts
regarding
the
negotiation
of
this
policy
which
led
to
that
endorsement.
this
policy
was
written
in
may
1951
and
your
honors
will
recall
the
korean
war
started
in
the
summer
of
1950.
as
a
result
of
that
war
and
the
step
up
and
the
draft,
a
number
of
automobile
liability
insurance
companies
evoked
this
type
of
policy,
refused
to
write
policies
on
servicemen.
the
result
was
that
the
hawkeye
company
received
a
flood
of
applications
from
young
men
who
were
entering
military
service.
so,
the
actuarial
department
wrote
a
bulletin
to
its
various
agents
in
which
it
pointed
out
that
the
company
wanted
to
only
insure
known
risks,
and
because
of
the
great
incidents
of
accidents
that
led
from
one
serviceman
lending
his
car
to
another,
the
actuarial
department
felt
that
it
was
wise
to
consider
whenever
writing
a
policy
for
servicemen,
whether
or
not
there
shouldn't
be
a
restriction
to
preclude
the
lending
of
car
to
another
serviceman
or
to
preclude
coverage
in
case
loss
occurred
as
a
result.
accordingly,
when
mr.
meehan
applied
to
one
of
the
hawkeye
agents
for
insurance,
the
agent
told
him
that
the
company
was
not
anxious
to
write
policies
for
servicemen,
but
the
agent
said,
“i
think
the
company
will
accept
you
if
you
agree
to
this
restriction.”
and
the
--
and
mr.
meehan
signed
a
written
statement
that
he
agreed
that
in
consideration
for
the
policy
being
issued,
the
insured
should
not
in
effect
if
the
car
was
driven
by
another
serviceman
while
meehan
was
not
in
the
car.
accordingly,
the
actuarial
department
of
hawkeye
approved
the
application
for
insurance.
they
felt
that
they
were
able
to
give
meehan
the
civilian
rate,
premium
rate
with
this
endorsement
in
the
policy.
in
other
words,
from
an
actuarial
standpoint,
they
believe
that
this
exclusion
equalized
the
rate
to
a
civilian
rate
and
as
a
result,
mr.
meehan
got
a
very
low
insurance
rate.
now,
when
the
--
when
the
new
car
was
bought
in
july
1951,
i
understand
this
company's
policy
first
covered
a
chevrolet
car
owned
by
meehan.
two
months
later,
meehan
having
since
gone
to
an
air
force
base
in
illinois,
having
left
iowa,
he
bought
a
new
car
with
his
fellow
serviceman,
gelhar.
and
meehan
wrote
to
the
insurance
company,
to
the
agent
and
said,
“would
you
please
change
this
policy
now
so
that
the
insurance
will
cover
my
co-owner?”
the
agent
wrote
back
and
said,
”we
cannot
do
that,
but
if
you
were
to
have
a
co-owner
who
is
another
serviceman,
you
better
turn
in
your
policy,
have
it
canceled
and
get
out
other
insurance
at
your
base.”
meehan,
however,
was
anxious
to
get
insurance.
he
couldn't
get
his
car
on
the
base
without
insurance,
so
on
receive
of
that
letter
he
merely
sent
only
the
description
of
the
car
and
nothing
more.
he
didn't
say
anything
about
whether
or
not
a
fellow
serviceman
was
still
to
be
a
co-owner,
and
the
agent
assumed
that
meehan
had
abandoned
the
idea
of
having
another
serviceman
and
put
through
this
change
of
car
endorsement,
which
amended
the
policy
to
provide.
it
should
cover
the
pontiac
car
instead
of
the
chevrolet
car.
meehan
--
both
meehan
and
gelhar
--
i
might
say
that
meehan
is
not
a
party
in
this
case,
never
was
a
party.
here,
you
have
an
action
brought
by
persons
who
are
strangers
to
the
contract
of
insurance.
meehan
has
never
complained
about
his
policy.
he
never
has
filed
any
--
voiced
any
complaint
that
the
policy
is
incorrect.
this
is
entirely
persons
who
are
strangers
to
the
contract
entirely.
the
hawkeye
company
has
never
had
any
negotiations
with
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
consequently,
when
this
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
no,
he
just
put
in
one
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
no,
after
the
initial
issuance
of
the
policy,
about
two
months
later,
meehan
decided
to
trade
in
his
old
for
a
new
one
and
that
was
the
time
when
he
wrote
asking
the
company
if
they
would
change
the
policy
brought
in
the
coverage
so
it
would
cover
a
co-serviceman.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
your
honor,
it
was
both
you
might
say
and
it
would
depend
on
how
you
construe
the
letter
but
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
there
--
there
is
a
separate
book
of
exhibits
if
the
court
please.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
and
exhibit
19
is
the
letter
from
meehan
to
wiedner.
exhibit
34
is
the
letter
from
wiedner
back
to
meehan,
wiedner
being
the
agent.
wiedner's
reply
to
meehan
is
exhibit
34.
that's
on
page
38
of
the
book
of
exhibits.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
exhibit
19
on
page
22
of
the
book
of
exhibits,
it's
a
longhand
letter
written
by
meehan
who
signs
the
letter
as
bud,
and
he
addresses
it,
dear
steve,
who
was
the
hawkeye
agent
in
waukon,
iowa.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
exhibit
34,
which
is
on
page
38.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that's
right.
in
fact,
the
letter
--
the
letter
reads,
“the
hawkeye
insurance
company
would
not
be
interested
in
keeping
the
policy
enforced
on
your
car
if
another
person
had
an
interest
in
the
car.
if
your
friend,
gelhar,
is
to
have
an
interest
in
the
car,
you
should
secure
other
insurance
from
an
insurance
man
near
chanute
field
and
send
back
the
policy
you
got
from
me
for
cancellation.”
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
and
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
no,
the
---
mr.
victor
m.
harding
the
--
the
agent
kept
a
very
small
office
and
kept
no
copies
of
his
correspondence.
meehan
did
not
keep
the
letter,
so
weidner
reconstructed
the
letter
as
well
as
he
could
recall
it
and
both
he
and
meehan
testified
to
it
and
confirmed
that
this
was
what
the
letter
said.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
right,
yes,
and
we
contend
that
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
set
it
aside.
we
contended
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
evidence
being
entirely
--
that
the
letter
did
pass,
that
the
court
could
not
properly
find
that
it
did
not.
in
other
words,
both
parties
to
the
letter,
both
the
sender
of
the
letter
and
the
recipient
testified
to
the
letter.
and
we
contended
that
therefore
the
district
court
could
not
find
otherwise.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
not
in
so
--
not
in
so
many
words,
your
honor.
and
i
may
say
that
whether
the
letter
passed
or
not,
it
had
no
effect
upon
the
district
court's
decision
and
had
no
effect
upon
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision.
it
was
just
an
--
an
incident
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
[laughs]
i
question
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
it's
only
because
your
honors
brought
the
question
up
where
counsel
himself
referred
to
a
letter
and
i
thought
i
should
answer
it.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
and
bud?
mr.
victor
m.
harding
they
both
testified
to
the
letter.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
no,
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
--
no.
they
were
the
only
persons
who
could
testify
to
it.
one
was
the
sender
of
the
letter
and
one
was
the
recipient.
gelhar,
who
was
a
complete
stranger
to
the
letter
of
course
couldn't
know
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
after
this
letter
passed
you
see
and
in
this
letter,
exhibit
19,
meehan
did
not
give
any
description
of
the
car.
so,
the
agent
wrote
in
his
letter,
“please
give
me
the
car
description.
otherwise,
i
can't
put
through
a
change
of
car
endorsement.”
so
in
reply
to
agent's
letter,
which
is
exhibit
34,
meehan
merely
jotted
down
in
a
slip
of
paper
a
description
of
the
car
and
sent
it,
mailed
it
to
the
agent.
the
agent
used
that
in
preparing
the
change
of
car
endorsement,
which
was
then
put
throughout
the
home
office
in
des
moines.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
there
is
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
i
don't
think
it
has
any
--
any
bearing
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
the
--
the
matter
is
complicated
because
of
the
wisconsin
motor
vehicle
safety
responsibility
law,
which
is
of
somewhat
have
been
a
barred
law,
and
it
was
under
this
law
that
hawkeye,
the
hawkeye
company
along
with
a
great
many
other
non-licensed
insurance
companies
filed
powers
of
attorney
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
and
that
power
of
attorney
has
lead
to
this
jurisdictional
dispute.
as
far
i
am
concerned,
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
policy
did
not
cover
this
accident.
in
other
words,
the
accident
occurred
while
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
i'll
explain
now
why
it
is.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
all
right,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
just
decide
the
jurisdictional
question.
my
position
is
that
in
order
to
determine
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals
first
had
to
decide
the
validity
of
that
restriction,
that
restrictive
endorsement.
and
having
--
and
they
first
have
to
decide
that
that
restrictive
endorsement
was
valid.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
no,
i
--
i
have
that
right
here.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
all
right,
it's
toward
the
end,
yes.
i
think
it's
on
page
326
of
the
record.
the
court
makes
this
statement,
“so
tenuous
are
plaintiffs'
contentions
resting
on
waiver
and
estoppel
that
a
detailed
disposition
of
them
is
unnecessary.
since
our
decision
hinges
upon
lack
of
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
need
to
discuss
other
points
urged
by
plaintiffs.”
mr.
victor
m.
harding
various
points
asserted
by
plaintiffs
in
this
appeal
are
simply
facets
of
a
basic
attempt
to
attack
jurisdiction,
and
once
argued
then,
quite
understandably,
plaintiffs
attempt
to
eradicate
the
restrictive
endorsement.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that's
right,
yes.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
on
a
little
further
if
i
may,
justice
frankfurter.
you
notice
the
--
the
remands
states
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
oh,
but
this
circular
reasoning
fails
to
supply
the
requisite
certificate
of
insurance.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
think
what
the
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
was
this.
that
in
order
to
find
jurisdiction
here
you
got
to
come
under
this
power
of
attorney
filed
by
the
hawkeye
company
under
this
wisconsin
law.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
don't
think
they
were
talking
about
the
stipulation
there.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
and
i
think
what
they
were
saying
there
is
that
you
--
until
you
first
come
under
that
power
of
attorney,
there's
no
sense
arguing
all
these
other
things
about
the
validity
of
the
restrictive
endorsement.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
i
think
they
have.
i
think
they
have
also
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
was
about
to
answer
that.
because
in
the
remand,
the
court
orders
not
only
that
the
motion
to
quash
the
return
of
service
of
summons
be
made,
but
it
also
directs
the
lower
court
to
dismiss
the
action.
now,
if
--
if
this
was
merely
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
no,
i
--
i
disagree.
i
think
if
your
honor
--
there's
no
jurisdiction.
all
you
do
is
quash
the
summons
as
the
case
still
pends,
because
you
can
always
maybe,
later
make
service
on
the
defendant.
you
don't
dismiss
the
action
when
you
--
when
you
find
no
jurisdiction
of
the
defendant.
you
merely
quash
the
summons,
and
the
court
of
appeals
went
beyond
that.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
no,
i
may
--
i
may
be
wrong
on
that
but
it's
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that's
right,
yes,
and
in
fact,
that's
often
happened.
i
have
known
cases
where
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
not
only
that
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
subject
matter,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor,
then
you
dismiss.
but
if
there
is
lack
of
jurisdiction
on
the
person
of
the
defendant,
you
don't
dismiss
the
action
you
really
quash
the
return
of
service.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i've
--
i've
always
understood
that
to
be
a
law.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
am
coming
to
that.
i
think
in
order
to
find
no
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals
first
had
to
decide
this
restrictive
endorsement
was
valid.
that's
the
point
i
was
coming
to.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
think
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
assume
that
because
it
was
considered
under
(inaudible)
it
was
considered
by
the
majority,
although
they
didn't
put
there.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
under
the
power
of
attorney.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
the
power
of
attorney
on
this
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
stipulated
to
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
majority
was
right.
i
like
to
talk
about
that
stipulation
for
just
a
minute
if
i
may.
we
initially
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
return
of
service
on
the
ground
that
this
power
of
attorney
did
not
confer
jurisdiction,
and
the
court
overruled
us.
now,
under
rule
12,
we
are
then
obliged
to
depend
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
we
must
then
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
we
were
in
a
predicament
where
we
had
to
interplead
other
parties
at
that
stage,
because
there
were
other
persons
in
wisconsin
who
were
making
similar
claims.
and
in
order
to
make
a
complete
defense
in
the
merits,
we
thought
it
proper
to
interplead
all
these
other
parties.
now,
we
had
filed
in
our
answer
a
--
this
jurisdictional
defense,
the
same
defense.
and
under
rule
12,
you
only
waive
a
defense
if
you
fail
to
plead
it
either
by
motion
or
answer.
now,
we've
have
done
both.
we've
pleaded
to
both
by
motion
and
by
answer.
the
stipulation
certainly
did
not
mislead
the
attorneys
for
the
petitioners
here.
they
had
already
represented
the
original
plaintiffs
and
they've
represented
these
new
plaintiffs.
and
certainly,
they
did
not
understand
that
we
were
waiving
any
jurisdictional
defense
here.
i
think
as
long
as
the
--
as
we
have
maintained
our
defense
in
the
answer,
i
think
we
have
not
stipulated
way
that
--
that
defense.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that's
right,
your
honor,
yes,
both
after
the
answer
and
after
the
motion
to
quash
the
return
of
service.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
i
think
you
can,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
we
did
here
because
we
maintained
by
the
stipulation.
we
continued
to
maintain
the
defenses
set
up
in
our
answer.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
--
it
states
in
so
many
words
that
but
that
is
the
effect
of
what
happened
because
our
answer
stood
to
all
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
i
think
i
can
--
i
can't
point
to
any
language
the
whole
--
the
whole
stipulation,
your
honor,
envisages
that
these
new
plaintiffs
come
in
and
they
are
subject
to
the
defenses
set
forth
in
our
answer.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
page
9
in
the
respondent's
brief,
your
honor,
we
set
forth
the
paragraph,
the
stipulation.
it
is
further
stipulated
and
agreed
that
the
defendant's
answer
previously
filed
in
this
matter
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
9
of
respondent's
brief.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that's
page
39,
page
41
of
the
record.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
sir,
the
bottom
of
page
9.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
sir.
it
is
further
stipulated
and
agreed
the
defendant's
answer
previously
filed
in
this
matter
be
amended
to
include
his
specif
denial
to
all
new
allegations
contained
instead
of
many
complaint,
any
denial
in
the
same
manner
as
hereinbefore
been
done
in
answer
to
each
of
said
paragraphs,
accepting
only
that
defendant
admits
the
execution
of
the
attached
stipulation
for
judgment
in
favor
ruth
petrowski
and
the
entry
of
the
attached
judgment
in
favor
of
ruth
petrowski
according
to
terms
thereon.
in
other
words,
we
continued
all
defenses
set
forth
in
our
--
in
our
answer.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
well,
that
wasn't
against
us.
that
was
against
gelhar.
we
consented
the
judgment
by
one
plaintiff
against
another
plaintiff.
that
was
in
order
to
reduce
the
--
the
liability
that
could
possibly
be
claimed
under
this
policy
to
affix
the
amounts
with
--
within
the
policy
limits.
otherwise,
it
might
have
gone
beyond
the
policy
limits.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
we
--
we
sought
it
to
--
to
liquidate
the
amount
of
this
particular
plaintiff's
claim
against
gelhar
to
fix
sum
of
money,
so
they
would
not
exceed,
so
all
the
claims
would
not
exceed
the
policy
limits.
that's
right,
yes.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
fact
to
the
court.
that
is
that
in
order
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
find
no
jurisdiction,
it
first
had
to
find
this
policy
restriction
was
valid.
now,
if
the
policy
restriction
is
valid,
then
this
jurisdictional
question
is
immaterial.
why
the
court
of
appeals
chose
to
do
it
that
way,
i
don't
know.
they
based
their
decision,
ultimate
decision
on
jurisdiction.
but
in
order
to
find
no
jurisdiction,
they
first
had
to
determine
that
this
policy
restriction
was
valid.
now,
the
policy
restriction
is
valid
and
i
submit
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
mainly
that
the
complaints
should
be
dismissed
against
the
respondent,
insurance
company.
now,
my
argument
on
this
comes
rather
under
the
wisconsin
safety
responsibility
act,
the
motor
vehicle
safety
responsibility
act.
that
act
does
not
require
persons
who
drive
cars
in
wisconsin
to
carry
automobile
liability
insurance.
the
act
has
two
portions.
first
of
which
is
the
safety
responsibility
portion,
and
that
comes
into
play
when
a
driver
has
his
first
accident.
and
if
he
--
if
the
accident
involves
injuries
of
a
certain
extent,
he
loses
his
driving
privileges
unless
he
has
in
effect
an
insurance
policy.
the
wisconsin
act
permits
unlicensed
insurance
companies
to
have
their
policies
qualify
under
this
law,
provided,
they
file
this
power
of
attorney
with
the
motor
vehicle
commissioner.
however,
the
act
provides
that
only
if
a
policy
is
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
does
it
qualify
as
to
relieve
the
driver
of
suspension
of
his
driving
privileges.
now,
in
this
case,
the
policy
contained
a
restriction,
which
by
its
terms,
resulted
in
the
policy
not
being
in
effect
when
this
accident
occurred.
consequently,
the
hawkeye
company,
under
this
power
of
attorney,
was
not
required
to
file
a
certificate
that
insurance
was
in
fact
covering
his
accident.
and
that
is
the
reason
that
the
hawkeye
company
did
not
certify
this
policy
under
the
wisconsin
act.
now,
if
the
--
if
this
endorsement
had
not
--
had
been
invalid,
then
the
policy
would
have
been
in
effect
because
the
policy
by
its
terms,
taking
this
endorsement
out,
covered
anyone
driving
with
the
owners'
permission.
consequently,
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
decide
that
this
endorsement
was
valid
that
the
policy
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
in
order
to
decide
that
the
power
of
attorney
did
not
apply,
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
--
my
argument
here
that
even
though
this
court
may
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
jurisdiction,
even
though
you
may
say
that
the
respondent
here
stipulated
himself
out
of
the
jurisdictional
defense,
nevertheless,
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
that
the
policy
restriction
was
valid
and
that
therefore,
the
complaint
against
the
defendant
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
that
certainly
was
litigated,
yes.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
that
was
very
hard
fought
--
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
we
did.
mr.
victor
m.
harding
yes,
it
--
it
doesn't
say
that
we
stipulate
that
we
reserved
only
certain
defenses,
your
honor.
it
just
says,
“it
does
not
constitute
any
waiver
of
any
defense
which
hawkeye
may
have
on
the
issue
of
insurance
coverage
and
its
liability.”
it
doesn't
say
that
it
doesn't
constitute
a
waiver
of
any
other
defense.
i
don't
see
that
that
necessarily
means
that
we
have
--
we
waive
the
jurisdictional
defense
by
that
statement.
i
agree
with
your
honors
that
careful
craftsmanship
would
--
would
have
written
a
different
stipulation.
i
did
not
handle
the
stipulations
handled
by
my
associate
when
i
was
in
the
trial
of
another
case.
the
stipulation
was
drafted
by
mr.
tinkham
and
sent
to
us,
and
it
was
signed
by
my
associate,
but
i
don't
think
there
was
any
intend
on
his
part
to
stipulate
away
the
jurisdictional
defense.
certainly,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
other
side
so
construed
it.
one
is
