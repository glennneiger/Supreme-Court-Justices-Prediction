mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
this
action
is
based
upon
diversity
of
citizenship
in
as
much
as
all
of
the
petitioners
are
resident
of
wisconsin
and
the
respondent
was
an
iowa
insurance
corporation.
the
petitioner
is
john
m.petrowski
and
grace
ringle,
have
brought
this
action
originally.
they
were
very
seriously
injured
in
an
automobile
accident
which
occurred
in
wisconsin
on
september
27th
of
1951.
they
started
their
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin
by
series
of
a
summon
upon
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
pursuant
to
a
power
of
attorney
which
had
been
executed
by
the
respondent
and
filed
with
the
commissioner's
office
authorizing
service
upon
him.
after
the
suit
was
started,
the
respondent
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
and
quash
the
service,
taking
the
position
that
that
service
of
process
was
not
valid
under
the
power
of
attorney.
the
district
court
overruled
that
motion,
and
then,
subsequently,
after
the
case
has
been
issued,
the
respondent
moved
to
interplead
the
other
petitioners'
named,
francis
gelhar
and
ruth
petrowski.
they
were
made
parties
of
this
lawsuit
at
the
request
of
respondent
who
stipulated
in
writing
to
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
the
same
as
if
and
i
am
quoting
“personal
service
had
been
obtained”
and
a
counterclaim
for
a
declaratory
relief
against
those
particular
inter
pleaded
petitioners.
the
question
before
the
court
today,
deals
with
jurisdiction
in
persona.
the
district
court
proceeded
to
try
this
case
upon
the
merits.
evidence
was
presented,
and
made
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
in
favor
of
the
petitioners.
the
key
question
on
the
merits
of
the
case
which
involved
coverage
under
an
insurance
policy
issued
by
the
respondent
was
whether
a
restrictive
endorsement
attached
to
the
policy,
which
denied
to
coverage
to
any
person
who
is
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
unless
he
was
the
named
insured
where
i
remember
the
name
insurance
household.
the
validity
of
that
particular
restrictive
endorsement
was
the
question
on
the
merits,
and
also,
whether
or
not
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
accident.
the
district
court
held
in
favor
of
the
petitioners,
finding
that
that
restrictive
endorsement
was
not
in
effect,
that
it
was
invalid,
and
made
findings
of
fact
that
the
conclusion
of
law
in
favor
of
the
petitioners.
then,
the
respondent
appealed
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
besides
raising
the
issues
on
the
merits
of
insurance
coverage
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
again,
raised
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
over
the
respondent's
corporate
person.
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
two-to-one
decision,
a
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
by
a
reason
of
the
servers
of
process
upon
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles
under
the
power
of
attorney
and
reversed
the
district
court,
solely
upon
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
persona.
we
have
petitioned
this
court
and
certiorari
was
granted.
now,
briefly,
the
questions
presented
are
first
of
all,
whether
the
power
of
attorney
was
valid
and
gave
to
the
district
court
through
the
service
of
process
upon
the
commissioner,
jurisdiction
to
try
the
case.
and
secondly,
and
irrespective
of
the
answer
of
the
first
question,
did
the
respondent,
by
its
affirmative
actions
after
the
case
had
been
issued,
waive
any
jurisdictional
question
and
did
it
not
stipulate,
in
writing,
to
jurisdiction
an
as
the
case
proceed
in
order
that
on
quoting
the
stipulation
that
there
could
be
an
adjudication
as
to
all
parties
injured
in
this
accident
upon
the
issues
of
insurance
coverage
to
avoid
a
multiplicity
of
lawsuits
and
to
make
that
determination
res
judicata.
i'm
quoting
from
the
stipulation
itself.
it's
our
position
that,
of
course,
that
was
a
waiver
of
any
jurisdictional
question
and
gave
to
the
district
court
jurisdiction
to
try
the
lawsuit.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
the
only
reservation
was
made
and
i
will
read
that
to
the
court
or
call
the
court's
attention
to
it
very
shortly,
a
reservation
that
they
reserved
the
right
to
dispute
the
coverage
of
the
insurance
policy.
they
denied
that
there
was
any
coverage
in
force
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
but
the
stipulation
expressly
states
that
they
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
the
same
as
a
personal
service
had
been
obtained
one
upon
the
other.
now,
turning
briefly
to
the
facts,
in
1950,
the
respondent
which
is
an
iowa
corporation
filed
a
power
of
attorney
in
question
with
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
now,
that
power
of
attorney
i
have
set
forth
in
full
at
pages
4
and
5
inform
the
important
points
i
have
put
out
in
full
at
pages
4
and
5
of
the
brief
for
petitioners,
and
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
it.
that
was
filed
in
1950.
this
accident
happened
in
1951.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
the
power
of
attorney
was
still
in
force
and
effect.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
never
been
rescinded
or
repudiated
in
any
way
by
the
respondent
and
i
am
informed
it
is
enforced
at
this
time.
now,
the
court
will
notice
that
that
power
of
attorney
states
very
clearly
at
page
4,
as
i
have
cited
and
quoted
in
my
brief,
the
hawkeye-security
insurance
company
hereby
applies
to
have
its
safety,
financial,
responsibility
notice
of
insurance
recognized
as
evidence
of
insurance
of
non-registrants
in
wisconsin.
i
might
stop
right
there
and
explain
to
the
court,
that
wisconsin
like
most
of
the
other
states
of
the
union
and
also
the
state
of
iowa
where
this
particular
contract
was
issued,
have
a
motor
vehicle
safety
responsibility
law.
that
law
provides
that
if
a
motorist
is
in
an
accident,
unless
he
deposits
security
to
cover
the
damages
to
the
people
involved,
he
will
lose
his
driving
privileges.
the
owner
of
the
car
will
lose
his
license
plates,
and
if
they
are
non
registrants
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
the
right
to
operate
on
wisconsin
highways
unless
they
have
a
policy
of
insurance
by
a
corporation
licensed
in
wisconsin
or
if
not
licensed
who
has
filed
a
power
of
attorney,
such
as
we
have
here
filed
by
the
hawkeye-security
insurance
company.
then,
we
also
have
the
financial
responsibility
as
part
--
part
of
the
law,
which
provides
that
if
a
person
has
had
his
driving
privileges
suspended
because
of
an
accident,
he
can
get
those
privileges
back
by
having
a
policy
certified
and
filed
to
prove
that
he
has
financial
responsibility
where
he
will
then
be
a
safe
risk
driver
up
on
the
highway.
now,
the
important
part
of
the
power
of
attorney,
i
believe,
is
contained
in
paragraphs
2
and
5.
the
court
will
notice
that
paragraph
2
states
that
the
governing
executive
authority
of
the
hawkeye-security
--
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
from
page
4
and
5
of
the
brief
for
petitioners,
your
honor,
that
the
governing
executive
authority
has
duly
adopted
a
resolution,
providing
that
its
policies
are
varied
to
comply
with
the
laws
of
this
state
relating
to
the
terms
of
motor
vehicle
liability
policies
it
should
vary
under
85.09
of
the
wisconsin
statutes.
i
might
say
that
there
is
no
dispute,
but
under
the
wisconsin
statutes
as
construed
by
our
highest
court
in
wisconsin,
any
restrictive
endorsement
such
as
the
type
here
attempted
to
be
placed
upon
this
policy
by
the
respondent
is
void.
and
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
power
of
attorney,
the
respondent
has
elected
as
to
any
accident
that
happens
in
wisconsin
to
vary
its
policies
so
its
terms
will
comply
with
the
requirements
of
wisconsin
to
protect
wisconsin's
persons'
injured
in
such
accidents.
and
next
is
the
part
of
the
power
of
attorney,
paragraph
5
dealing
with
the
appointment
of
the
commissioner.
and
if
the
court
will
read
that
in
the
succeeding
two
paragraphs
it
would
become
very
apparent
that
it
is
an
outright
appointment
of
the
commissioner
of
motor
vehicles
of
wisconsin
as
the
agent
for
the
respondent
for
service
of
process
as
to
any
--
any
action
arising
out
of
a
motor
vehicle
accident
in
wisconsin.
it
is
our
position
that
clearly
this
was
such
an
accident,
it
had
happened
in
wisconsin.
this
is
an
action
to
enforce
the
liability
of
the
respondent,
insurance
company
under
the
policy
of
insurance
which
it
had
enforced
upon
the
current
question
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
now,
in
the
brief
of
respondents,
they
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
an
action
arising
out
of
a
motor
vehicle
accident,
but
this
is
an
action
upon
a
judgment,
which
of
course
it
is,
but
the
judgment
was
obtained
because
of
the
injuries
in
this
accident.
also,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
petitioners
could
not
have
brought
suit
directly
against
the
insurer
to
determine
the
liability
of
the
insured
driver
because
of
the
standard
no-action
clause
which
was
contained
in
the
policy,
which
prohibits
persons
injured
from
bringing
a
direct
action
against
the
insured
and
the
insurer
to
determine
the
liability
under
the
negligent
laws.
therefore,
they
in
effect
are
saying
that
the
power
of
attorney
would
never
be
in
effect
and
we
would
never
have
a
right
to
sue
them,
and
that
of
course
i
believe
cannot
be
the
intention
of
the
power
of
attorney.
now,
the
particular
policy
here
involved
was
issued
by
the
respondent
in
iowa
on
may
7th
of
1951.
the
respondent
had
previously
covered
the
same
insured
who
was
a
boy
named
meehan.
while
meehan
was
still
in
civilian
life,
covered
the
same
car,
the
original
policy
had
no
such
armed
forces
restricted
endorsement
as
was
contained
in
this
policy.
however,
that
policy
had
lapsed.
mr.
meehan
had
gone
into
the
armed
services
and
was
then
a
corporal
at
chanute
field,
illinois
and
he
came
back
home
to
get
his
car
and
got
this
new
policy.
and
solely
because
he
was
then
a
member
of
the
armed
forces,
the
respondent
added
the
restrictive
endorsement
here
in
question
to
the
policy
which
denies
coverage
to
anyone
else
operating
the
car
who
was
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
unless
he
is
a
member
of
the
immediate
family
of
the
named
insured.
now,
mr.
meehan
and
the
corporal,
francis
gelhar,
who
is
also
one
of
the
petitioners
here
and
who
seems
to
have
and
does
have
under
the
district
court's
decision
a
declaratory
judgment
declaring
that
the
policy
was
enforced
and
covered
him.
in
july
of
1951,
these
two
boys
were
buddies
at
the
airfield
in
chanute,
and
they
decided
they
would
trade
in
meehan's
old
chevrolet
and
get
a
newer
pontiac
automobile
together
and
they
jointly
purchased
the
new
car.
they
paid
for
the
down
payment
jointly.
they
paid
the
various
insurance
premiums,
including
this
policy's
premium
was
contributed
to
equally
between
them.
as
soon
as
the
new
car
was
purchased,
the
--
the
boy,
meehan,
wrote
to
the
agent
of
the
company
who
was
a
cousin
of
his
incidentally
in
iowa
and
told
him
in
effect,
“francis
gelhar
and
i
have
bought
this
new
car
together
and
i'd
like
to
have
the
policy
transfer
to
cover
him
as
well
as
myself
and
to
cover
the
new
car.
upon
receipt
of
that
request,
the
agent
immediately
notified
the
home
office
of
the
company
and
a
change
of
car
endorsement
was
issued
and
that
was
in
turn
sent
directly
back
to
the
boy,
meehan
which
changed
the
coverage
to
the
car
that
was
in
fact
involved
in
this
accident.
now,
there
is
a
claim
and
there
was
a
claim
upon
the
trial
that
there
was
other
correspondence
between
the
agent
and
the
assured,
named
insured
meehan
to
the
effect
that
we
cannot
cover
you
if
you
are
going
to
have
someone
else
on
the
car
with
you.
however,
the
district
court
found
upon
conflicting
evidence
that
no
such
correspondence
took
place
and
that
the
only
correspondence
that
was
held
between
these
parties
was
a
notification
of
the
agent
of
the
joint
ownership
and
the
request
for
joint
coverage.
and
the
reply
back,
it
wasn't
reply
at
all.
it
was
rather
the
change
of
car
endorser
which
is
exhibit
4
in
the
volume
of
exhibits,
changing
the
coverage
to
the
new
car
which
was
then
jointly
owned
by
gelhar
and
meehan.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
that
restrictive
endorsement
was
on
the
policy
as
issued
originally
back
in
may.
that
was
still
in
their
possession
down
in
illinois.
that
was
unsigned,
however,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court,
but
that
was
still
in
illinois.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
there
was
not
a
new
policy
issued.
they
merely
issued
a
rider
describing
the
new
automobile,
the
pontiac
automobile
in
place
of
the
original
chevrolet
automobile.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
basis
for
their
denial
of
coverage
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
the
new
owner
was
not
mentioned.
the
--
however,
the
agents
--
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
then,
when
they
bought
the
new
car
together,
they
notified
the
agent
that
they
owned
it
jointly
and
asked
the
coverage
be
changed
to
cover
the
new
car
on
the
two
of
them.
then
all
they
got
back
in
reply
from
the
agent
was
this
endorsement
changing
the
coverage
from
the
chevrolet
to
the
pontiac.
these
boys
then
assumed
that
they
were
covered
and
did
not
give
any
other
insurance.
subsequently,
the
boy,
gelhar
who
was
also
a
corporal
at
this
air
base
was
home
in
wisconsin
on
furlough,
and
of
course
he
had
the
car
with
the
knowledge
and
permission
of
his
co-owner
and
the
accident
happened
there
and
these
people
were
badly
hurt.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court,
service
is
obtained
under
the
power
of
attorney.
it's
our
position
that
that
service
was
valid,
that
the
power
of
attorney
is
very
clear
in
its
terms.
the
court
of
appeals
read
into
that
power
of
attorney
and
through
its
decision,
a
requirement
that
it
would
not
be
effective
until
and
unless
the
respondent,
insurance
company
had
filed
a
certificate
of
coverage
with
the
motor
vehicle
department.
however
--
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
both
your
honor.
now,
--
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
--
i
take
the
position
and
we
originally
served
the
summons
pursuant
to
the
power
of
attorney,
and
it
is
our
position
that
he
erratically
appointed
the
commissioner
as
an
agent
for
service
of
process
and
that
the
service
upon
the
commissioner
was
the
equivalent
of
personal
service.
and
we
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
power
of
attorney
other
than
that
the
--
it
arises
out
of
an
automobile
accident
in
wisconsin.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
yes,
sir,
he
did
in
his
motion
to
quash.
then,
in
his
answer,
he
also
did
that
same
thing,
then
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
under
that
waiver,
question
immediately.
thereafter,
when
the
case
was
at
issue,
the
respondent
wished
to
have
all
of
the
parties
who
were
injured
in
this
accident
before
the
court
so
that
the
adjudication
on
the
issue
of
insurance
coverage
and
the
validity
of
the
restricted
endorsement
would
be
binding
upon
all
persons
who
were
injured.
therefore,
it
moved
the
court
to
interplead
and
to
issue
on
amended
summons
bringing
in
francis
gelhar
and
ruth
petrowski
as
additional
parties
to
this
lawsuit.
ruth
petrowski
did
not
want
to
come
into
that
lawsuit
at
that
time,
but
because
the
respondent
agreed
to
let
her
take
judgment
in
this
action
for
the
full
amount
of
the
balance
remaining
available
under
the
policy
of
insurance
and
the
limits
of
that
policy
and
by
stipulation,
she
took
a
judgment
against
the
negligent
driver,
francis
gelhar
for
the
balance
remaining
available
under
the
policy
of
insurance.
and
it
was
stipulated
in
writing
by
the
respondent
at
that
time,
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
that
stipulation
which
is
set
forth
at
page
8
and
9
of
my
brief,
stipulated
as
follows
and
this
was
on
file
and
it
was
a
part
of
district
court
proceedings
before
the
trial
commenced.
i'm
quoting,
“that
each
of
the
parties
to
this
stipulation
voluntarily
submits
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
above
entitled
court
without
service
of
process
herein,
the
same
as
if
personal
service
had
been
obtained
by
each
against
the
other.”
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
interpleader
and
the
bringing
in
of
all
of
these
parties
was
at
the
request
of
that
respondent,
so
that
it
would
not
be
faced
as
the
stipulation
states,
with
a
multiplicity
of
lawsuit.
and
so,
that,
as
the
stipulation
states,
this
action
could
determine
as
to
all
parties,
the
issues
on
the
merits
of
insurance
coverage
so
that
it
would
res
judicata
as
to
both
the
respondent
and
each
of
the
petitioners
who
were
injured
in
the
accident.
so,
it
is
our
opposition
that
they
stipulate
to
jurisdiction
and
waive
the
question
they
have
previously
brought
before
the
court
on
jurisdiction
in
personam
for
the
reason
that
they
wanted
to
bring
in
all
of
these
parties
and
have
the
action
decided
now
rather
than
having
some
of
the
petitioners
go
to
iowa
where
admittedly
the
venue
would
like
and
where
of
course
the
interpleaded
plaintiffs
could
have
gone,
had
they
desired
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
under
rule
12
of
the
federal
rules.
there
is
no
doubt.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
that
they
have
a
right
to
come
into
the
court
and
make
a
general
appearance
as
long
as
they
have
in
their
answer
or
in
their
motion,
raise
a
jurisdictional
question.
but
after
doing
that,
then
they
went
forward
in
this
case
and
interpleaded
and
asked
for
the
interpleader
of
these
various
parties.
they
counterclaimed
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
--
and
they
allowed
a
judgment
to
be
taken
in
this
action,
in
this
court,
in
the
district
court,
giving
judgment
in
favor
of
one
of
the
parties
being
impleaded
on
the
very
day
that
she
was
interpleaded
and
stipulated
a
jurisdiction
that
all
of
these
issues
couldn't
be
decided.
and
now,
they
have
been
decided
by
the
district
court,
favorably
to
the
petitioners.
it's
our
position
that
the
respondent
cannot
stipulate
the
jurisdiction
for
its
own
purposes
if
it
wins
and
have
the
adjudication
favorable
as
to
all
parties,
but
if
it
loses
let's
say,
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
in
conclusion,
the
petitioners
take
the
position
first
of
all
that
there
was
jurisdiction
by
the
service
of
the
army
commissioner
under
the
power
of
attorney
in
the
very
clear
terms
there
set
forth,
but
that
in
any
event,
the
respondent,
thereafter,
for
its
own
purposes
and
for
its
own
advantages
to
avoid
as
it's
stated
a
multiplicity
of
lawsuits,
agreed
that
this
action
would
be
the
basis
for
determining
all
questions
of
insurance
coverage
upon
the
merits
and
that
the
district
court
has
made
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
were
no
way
set
aside
by
any
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
sole
reason
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
the
decision
that
there
was
not
jurisdiction
in
personam.
and
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
we
think
erroneously
sent
--
sent
the
case
back
with
direction
to
grant
the
motion
to
quash
the
service.
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
to
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
might
explain
that
each
of
the
various
petitioners'
recovered
judgments
in
the
state
courts
in
wisconsin
for
their
respective
injuries,
except
francis
gelhar,
who
was
the
boy,
driving
the
car
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
he
joined
in
the
action
to
have
a
declamatory
judgment
of
coverage.
and
so,
each
one
of
these
petitioners
has
their
own
judgment
and
they're
suing
upon
that
judgment
to
enforce
the
collection
of
a
judgment
under
the
terms
of
the
policy.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
was
signed
in
this
action
with
the
file
in
this
action.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
yes,
sir,
gelhar
and
his
attorneys
signed
it.
ruth
petrowski
and
myself
as
her
attorney
signed
it
and
the
hawkeye-security
company
and
its
attorney
signed
it
also.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
very
brief
reply,
the
stipulation
referred
to
by
counsel
for
respondent
at
the
bottom
of
page
9
and
the
top
of
page
10
of
his
brief
is
a
separate
stipulation
from
the
one
giving
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
the
one
that
i
have
referred
to
on
page
8
and
9
of
my
brief.
the
stipulation
that
counsel
for
the
insurance
company
refers
to
at
page
9
and
10
of
his
brief
was
the
stipulation
whereby
we
agreed
to
bring
in
the
other
parties
being
interpleaded
as
party's
plaintiff
and
they
would
set
forth
in
the
amended
complaint,
the
terms
of
their
judgments
and
asking
for
relief,
and
the
only
reason
for
this
stipulation
quoted
by
respondent
is
so
that
they
would
deny
for
the
record,
the
new
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
to
the
new
interpleaded
plaintiffs.
but
then,
we
went
on
and
we
have
this
expressed
stipulation
to
jurisdiction
which
i
have
set
forth
at
pages
8
and
9
of
my
brief.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention,
particularly
to
paragraph
6,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
9
where
the
respondent
reserves
only
the
issue
of
insurance
coverage
and
the
validity
of
the
restrictive
endorsement
and
stipulates
clearly
that
they
voluntarily
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
above
entitled
court
without
service
of
process
herein,
the
same
as
if
personal
service
had
been
obtained.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
i
--
the
stipulation
amending
the
complaint
and
amending
the
answers
so
are
to
deny
the
new
allegations
as
to
the
new
party's
plaintiff
was
the
one
that
mr.
harding
has
just
referred
to.
then,
we
had
a
separate
stipulation
which
i
believe
was
executed
the
same
day,
stipulating
to
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
this
action,
the
same
as
if
personal
service
had
been
obtained
and
so
that
we
would
avoid
a
multiplicity
of
lawsuit.
and
so,
if
this
action
would
be
brought
out
in
the
district
court
would
be
res
judicata
as
the
stipulation
provides,
would
be
res
judicata
on
that
issue.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
well
--
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
that's
paragraph
1,
your
honor,
on
the
page
8.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
have
been
if
we
haven't
maintained
in
our
answer
this
defense
which
was
set
forth
there,
the
defense
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
well,
i
agree
that
two
are
--
appear
to
be
inconsistent,
but
i
think
reading
behind
the
lines,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
intent
there
to
waive
that
defense.
i
don't
think
counsel
so
understood
it.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
well
--
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
the
--
the
two
stipulations
are
dated
the
same
date,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
well,
one
is
a
stipulation
for
judgment
and
the
other
is
a
stipulation
adding
party's
plaintiff.
those
are
the
titles
in
the
two
stipulations.
now,
there
is
that
language
in
one
of
them,
which
appears
to
indicate
a
waiver
of
the
jurisdictional
defense.
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
well
--
mr.
richard
p.
tinkham,
jr.
by
saying
that
we
waive
the
defense
in
our
answer
to
the
jurisdiction.
that
would
make
it
stronger
i
think,
and
it
would
--
it
would
avoid
any
--
any
inconsistency
between
our
pleading
and
the
stipulation.
