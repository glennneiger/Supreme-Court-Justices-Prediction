why
do
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
say
that
in
your
stipulation?
that
was
--
that's
what
i
mentioned,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
read
to
me
the
portion
of
your
--
of
your
stipulation
that
you
--
you
believe
leads
to
that
conclusion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
it
say
that?
where
does
it
say
that
--
that
they
are
subject
to

to
the
--
all
of
the
defenses
stated

page

of
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
the
stipulation
that
you're
reading
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
was
in
substance
telling
in
your
favor,
wasn't
not?
you
saw
this
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
tinkham.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harding,
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
that
language
that
you
put
in
that
stipulation
that
mr.
tinkham
has
just
read
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
which
appears
on
--
on
page
--
i
think
it's
on
page
9
of
his
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
that
language
where
you
do
submit
to
the
court,
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
paragraph
1
which
says,
“that
each
of
the
parties
to
this
stipulation
voluntarily
submits
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
above
entitled
court.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that
should
by
implication
be
read
as
preserving
the
right
to
the
jurisdiction
which
you
said
you
voluntarily
permitted
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
i
--
when
i
asked
you
the
question,
i
ask
where
in
the
stipulation
did
that
occur
and
you
--
you
told
me
it's
on
page
9
of
your
brief
but
that's
another
stipulation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
this
stipulation
has
got
to
be
for
what
its
worth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
may
be
but
they
refer
to
other
matters,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
appears
to
it,
but
it's
--
how
could
you
make
it
any
more
apparent
than
it
is
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
words
could
you
say
here
that
would
--
would
--
more
clearly
bring
you
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
to
say
that
“each
of
the
parties
to
this
stipulation
voluntarily
submits
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
above
entitled
court
without
service
of
process
herein,
the
same
as
if
personal
service
had
been
obtained
by
each
against
the
other.”
how
could
strengthen
that
language
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
