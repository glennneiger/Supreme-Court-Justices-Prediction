justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that's
a
lot
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
it?
could
you
turn
to
that
opinion
which
they
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
if
you
--
perhaps
if
i
tend
to
--
the
opinion
is
whether
they
were
(inaudible)
in
petitioners'
position.
if
you
turn
to
page
40
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
see,
just
toward
the
end
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
read
the
paragraph
before,
that's
the
one
that
wasn't
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
what
you've
been
talking.
that's
what
you
were
--
about
range,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
you
go
on,
the
next
sentence
is
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
--
i
mean
i
don't
understand.
what
is
the
circular
reasoning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
or
the
stipulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
can
find
it
in,
an
end
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
that's
what
i
gather
at
least.
i
don't
understand
why
that's
particular
argument,
but
they
have
decided
against
the
petition
on
that
court,
haven't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
it
was
found
that
that
was
an
error,
have
they
decided
any
more
except
that
question
of
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
that.
was
that
--
is
that
record
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
conviction
of
process
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
see
the
signs
that
that
does
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
court
find
that
there's
no
jurisdiction,
he
must
say
well,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
where
there's
an
opportunity
to
amend
the
clarity
that
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
expose
this
litigation
to
tend
to
follow
to
this
litigation,
isn't
it?
you
had
an
affidavit.
you
had
a
--
you
had
the
inherent
(inaudible)
you
had
the
stipulation
and
then
they
submit
no
jurisdiction,
and
i
should
impose
both
normal
figures,
that's
what
this
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
assume,
assume
--
all
right,
i'll
take
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
that
so,
but
how
does
that
pass
down
to
your
problem
in
a
restrictive
endorsement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
adjudicated
in
the
--
that
issue
can
under
--
been
adjudicated
in
the
district
court,
one
is
(inaudible)
the
issue
of
--
that
there
was
no
effect
on
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
thought
that
was
in
the
district
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
argued
into
the
court
of
appeals.
