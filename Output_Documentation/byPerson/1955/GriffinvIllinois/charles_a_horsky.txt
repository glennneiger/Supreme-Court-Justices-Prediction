mr.
charles
a.
horsky
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
it
involves
a
substantial
question
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
system
of
criminal
appeals
presently
existing
in
illinois.
specifically,
it
involves
the
question
whether
either
or
both
of
those
clauses
are
violated
by
a
system
of
criminal
appeals
which
makes
a
full
review
in
a
criminal
case
dependent
upon
the
filing
in
the
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
a
transcript
of
the
proceeding
but
which
makes
no
provision
by
which
an
indigent
defendant
may
secure
a
copy
of
that
transcript.
the
facts
on
which
the
case
comes
here
are
relatively
simple
and
can
be
quickly
stated.
the
two
petitioners
were
indicted
in
illinois
for
armed
robbery
and
after
a
trial
they
were
convicted
and
sentenced
respectively
to
5
to
10
years
and
10
to
15
years
in
the
illinois
penitentiary.
following
the
denial
of
motions
for
a
new
trial
and
in
arrest
of
judgment,
the
petitioners
filed
in
the
nisi
prius
court,
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county,
illinois,
a
motion
for
transcript
of
proceedings
and
court
record
without
cost.
this
motion
alleged
in
substance
that
the
petitioners
needed
the
court
records
and
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
in
order
to
perfect
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
they
believe
that
there
were
appealable
errors
in
the
record
and
that
they
were
without
funds.
they
also
alleged
that
the
failure
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
supply
a
record
on
which
they
could
perfect
an
appeal
would
deny
them
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
due
process
of
law
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
motion
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
without
hearing
and
without
argument
in
february
1954.
in
april,
the
petitioners
filed
a
petition
under
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
of
illinois.
that
act
provides
a
summary
means
by
which
prisoners
confined
in
illinois
penitentiaries
may
seek
a
review
of
any
claim
that
they
are
being
held
in
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights.
the
petition
in
this
case
asserted
that
the
failure
--
it
asserted
essentially
the
same
grounds
as
were
asserted
in
the
previous
motion
that
the
failure
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
accord
them
a
record
upon
which
they
could
perfect
an
appeal
when
they
were
unable
to
do
so
because
of
indigence
and
when
they
believed
that
there
were
appealable
errors
denied
them
rights
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
state
attorney
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county,
illinois
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
that
raised
no
substantial
question
of
either
state
or
federal
constitutional
law
and
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
petition.
the
petitioners
then
filed
a
timely
petition
for
a
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
seeking
a
review
of
that
order.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
although
allowing
the
petitioners
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
as
they
had
requested,
also
dismissed
the
petition.
its
memorandum
order,
which
is
quite
short,
appears
in
the
record
at
page
13
and
i
think
it's
worth
reading
it
so
we'll
be
sure
what
the
court
below
decided.
after
reciting
some
of
the
facts
which
i
recited
here,
the
opinion
states,
â€œpetitioners'
soul
contention
is
that
they
were
deprived
the
due
process
of
law
and
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
in
that,
they
were
financially
unable
to
purchase
a
bill
of
exceptions
and
were
therefore
unable
to
--
to
obtain
a
complete
review
by
this
court.
this
charge
presents
no
substantial
constitutional
question
and
the
writs
of
error
are
therefore
denied."
thereupon
this
court
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
basic
to
the
issue
which
this
case
presents
is
an
understanding
of
exactly
what
the
criminal
appeals
system
in
illinois
amounts
to
today.
it
was
recently
reviewed
by
this
court
in
the
jennings
case
but
i
think
it
well
to
resummarize
it
so
we'll
have
it
in
our
mind.
the
procedure
for
review
of
the
criminal
conviction
in
illinois
is
basically
by
a
writ
of
error
and
illinois
has
provided
that
writs
of
error
in
all
criminal
cases
are
writs
of
right
and
shall
be
issued
as
of
course.
the
scope
of
the
review
on
a
writ
of
error,
however,
may
vary
widely.
it
is
possible
to
have
in
illinois
--
i
don't
mean
it's
possible,
there
are
in
illinois,
frequently,
appeals
for
writs
of
error
on
what
is
known
as
the
clerk's
mandatory
record
or
what
might
be
called
the
common
law
record.
the
clerk
maintains
this
record
in
every
case,
the
indictment,
the
plea,
the
arraignment
of
plea
and
the
sentence.
when
review
on
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
on
a
record
of
that
sort,
the
supreme
court
does
and
it
must
limit
its
review
to
the
questions
which
are
open
on
the
face
of
those
documents.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
practically
general.
well,
they
are
general
entries
with
one
exception,
illinois
has
provided
that
the
arraignment
shall
be
transcribed
and
included
in
the
common
law
record
in
each
case
in
order
to
avoid
the
frequent
difficulties
about
assignment
of
counsel.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
the
common
law
record
in
illinois
or
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
a
common
law?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
as
far
as
i
think
the
common
law
record
is
described
accurately
and
perhaps
better
it's
for
me
to
quote
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
than
to
try
to
remember
it.
the
record
in
the
trial
court
--
i'm
reading
from
page
13
of
my
brief
which
is
a
quotation
from
people
against
loftus,
a
description
of
the
appellate
system
in
illinois
in
response
to
a
request
by
this
court
that
it
be
more
clearly
defined.
the
record
in
the
trial
court
may
consist
only
of
the
mandatory
record
of
his
indictment,
arraignment,
plea,
trial
and
judgment.
that
is
i
suspect
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
what
they
would
call
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
a
common
law
record.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
suppose
whether
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
whether
the
indictment
states
a
crime,
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
on
the
offense,
i
can
think
of
a
variety
of
questions
that
might
be
apparent
on
the
face
of
those
documents.
it
does
not
reach
trial
error
which
is
the
next
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right,
essentially.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
he
could
have
copies
of
that.
we
don't
--
there's
no
problem
about
that
currently.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
is
available.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
by
custom,
i
believe.
there
isn't
it
very
much
to
it
except
just
the
clerk
entries,
the
docket
entries.
although,
the
statue
as
i
said,
your
honor,
specifically
provide
now
and
this
is
a
very
recent
statute
of
1953
that
the
arraignment
shall
be
transcribed
and
included
in
the
clerk's
record
in
every
case
without
cost
to
anybody,
that's
automatic.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
has
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
has
a
copy
of
the
indictment,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
when
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
that's
what
i'm
coming
to,
your
honor.
that's
--
that's
--
i
was
just
saying
you
can
go
up
on
the
common
law
record.
now,
if
you
wish
to
review
errors
which
occurred
at
the
trial,
trial
errors
of
the
normal
sort,
the
procedure
in
illinois
is
clearly
spelled
out.
you
do
it
by
way
of
a
bill
of
exceptions.
the
record
--
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
statutory
and
by
rule
of
court
both.
but
the
rules
of
court
are
incorporated
in
the
statute.
you
apply
to
the
official
court
reporter,
who
makes
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings
in
all
cases,
for
a
copy
of
the
transcript
and
after
having
procured
that
copy
of
the
transcript,
you
present
it
to
the
judge
for
a
formal
approval
as
your
bill
of
exceptions
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
you
pay
the
official
court
reporter
in
illinois
for
that
transcript
at
a
rate
prescribed
by
statute
as
not
to
exceed
20
cents
per
hundred
words.
in
all
cases,
say
of
one,
if
you
are
an
indigent
defendant
sentenced
to
death,
the
fee
to
the
official
court
reporter,
20
cents
per
hundred
words,
is
paid
by
the
county
in
which
the
conviction
occurred.
on
that
record,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
can
review
all
trial
errors
of
all
sorts.
the
--
the
full
record
is
before
the
illinois
court.
it
is
that
kind
of
a
review
that
is
not
available
to
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
let
me
--
let
me
address
myself
to
what
i
think
is
troubling
you.
there
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
--
i
think
--
thought
you
were.
i
was
going
to
come
to
that.
in
illinois,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
and
i
think
it
is
true
irrespective
of
this
case,
there
is
no
contention
that
the
petitioners
could
have
avoided
their
present
play
by
using
some
substitute
for
the
bill
of
exception,
such
as
a
bystanders'
bill
or
a
narrative
statement
of
the
record
or
a
stipulated
statement.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
one
more
sentence
and
i
think
i
will
answer.
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
had
that
question
before
it
in
several
cases
and
although
bystanders'
bills
are
recognized
in
illinois
and
have
been
used
in
civil
case,
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
held
two
or
three
times
that
that
is
not
a
practicable
remedy
for
an
indigent
prisoner
to
secure
review
of
trial
error
in
that
state.
the
cases
are
cited
at
page
18
of
the
brief
and
there
is
a
quotation
from
one
of
the
footnote
at
page
50
of
the
brief.
now,
let
me
also
put
to
one
side
one
other
possibility
which
might
seem
to
be
relevant
but
which
is
not
and
that
is
the
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act
procedure
by
which
it
is
also
possible
under
certain
circumstances
to
obtain
a
free
transcript.
as
i
said,
the
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act
provides
a
method
by
which
one
confined
in
a
--
an
illinois
penitentiary
may
challenge
the
legality
of
this
confinement
for
the
--
may
challenge
the
legality
of
this
confinement
on
the
ground
that
there
were
constitutional
infirmatives
in
the
proceeding
by
which
he
was
convicted.
that
under
--
the
procedure
under
that
statute
is
the
procedure
adopted
here,
a
petition
is
filed
in
a
nisi
prius
court
and
upon
a
proper
showing,
the
nisi
prius
judge
is
authorized
to
require
the
official
court
reporter
to
type
up
such
portions
of
the
transcript
or
all
of
the
transcript
necessary
to
determine
the
constitutional
claim.
the
cost
of
typing
up
the
transcript
in
that
situation
for
an
indigent
is
born
by
the
states.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
also
held,
however,
that
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
procedures
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
an
alternative
method
by
which
to
review
trial
errors
which
do
not
rise
to
constitutional
magnitude.
it
is
not
a
device
by
which
the
ordinary
errors
which
might
require
a
reversal
of
a
conviction
but
which
do
not
involve
in
and
of
themselves
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
can
be
reviewed,
such
claims
as
the
improper
admission
or
exclusion
of
evidence,
the
inadequacy
or
the
inaccuracy
of
the
judges'
charge,
whether
the
evidence
of
courts
diverted.
those
questions
can
be
reviewed
in
illinois
only
on
a
bill
of
exceptions
and
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
that
it
is
conceded
here
as
indeed
i
believe
it
was
conceded
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
jennings
case
that
for
the
indigent
prisoner,
such
as
the
petitioner,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
review
of
trial
error
for
them
except
he
be
sentenced
today.
for
them,
trial
error
does
not
exist.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
sir,
there
is
not.
i
--
i
don't
wish
to
say
that
there
isn't
anything
like
that
in
illinois.
what
i
do
say
and
what
i
think
i
can
say
categorically
is
that
the
illinois
courts
themselves
recognize
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
an
indigent
can
secure
a
review
of
trial
error.
that
seems
to
be
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
as
a
fact
and
they,
as
i
point
out
in
their
memorandum
opinion,
do
not
regard
that
as
an
unconstitutional
situation.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
narrative
form
--
i
don't
know
that
illinois
would
object
to
a
narrative
form,
but
i
think
that
the
narrative
form
is
probably
under
the
circumstances
of
the
modern
systems
of
court
reporting,
your
honor,
a
much
more
difficult
system
to
accomplish
than
to
have
just
an
ordinary
transcript.
in
illinois,
there
is
an
official
report
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
somebody's
got
to
narrate
it,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
is
not
--
i
can
say
only
when
i
said
before
that
illinois
does
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
does
not
believe
itself
that
that
is
a
remedy.
the
illinois
supreme
court
itself
said
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
isn't
available
--
it
isn't
available.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
what
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
they
haven't
said
that.
they
--
they
say
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
not
available
to
an
indigent
prisoner,
and
i
think
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
record
of
any
indigent
prisoner
having
succeeded
in
doing
that
in
illinois
in
any
way.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
i
don't
--
i
think
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
as
a
practical
matter
it
isn't
available
that
i
have
the
word
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
for
them.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
because
i
find
no
cases
in
illinois
but
certainly
none
in
recent
times
and
i've
gone
over
a
number
of
criminal
cases
in
which
there
has
been
any
attempt
to
go
up
on
anything
other
than
the
ordinary
transcript
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
i
--
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
let
me
add
that
if
the
indigent
has
not
crossed
--
doesn't
have
the
money
to
pay
for
that
transcript,
it
is
supplied
to
him
by
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
in
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
in
illinois?
well,
i
think
counsel
is
furnished
in
illinois
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
some
cases
and
some
not
i
would
suppose.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
practice
of
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
but
in
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
sir,
i
--
i
take
it
not.
i
would
--
i
would
defer
to
mr.
wines
on
the
intricacies
of
illinois
procedure
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
because
i
am
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
illinois
has
said
in
these
cases
which
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
you
can't
have
a
--
a
short
bill
of
exception
that
you
must
always
type
up
the
whole
transcript,
of
course
you
can
have
a
bill
of
exceptions
which
will
relate
to
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
the
particular
error.
well,
you
might
even
have
errors
of
that
sort
but
if
you
have
a
question,
for
example,
is
the
evidence
sufficient
to
support
the
conviction?
you've
got
to
have
the
whole
transcript.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
--
it
is
possible
in
illinois
to
raise
that
question
other
than
by
having
the
whole
transcript
typed
up.
i
don't
believe
you
can
do
it
by
stipulation
or
by
a
substitute.
and
if
your
honors
will
look,
i
don't
have
the
specific
facts
of
these
cases
in
mind
but
if
the
cases
cited
on
page
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
14
and
the
top
of
page
15,
there
are
instances
in
those
cases,
the
johns
case,
mckinlay
case,
the
o'connell
case
and
the
others
in
which
indigent
defendants
attempt
to
take
a
common
law
record
and
to
support
it
by
additional
materials,
informal
materials,
affidavits,
lawyer
certificates,
of
things
of
that
sort,
they
were
uniformly
rejected
by
the
supreme
court
(inaudible)
inadequately
and
improperly
and
not
sufficient
to
raise
any
question
beyond
the
face
of
the
indictment
where
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
sometimes
it
was
that.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
let
me
--
let
me
be
clear,
your
honor.
i
don't
doubt
that
the
illinois
can
divide
a
system
for
making
criminal
review
or
review
of
criminal
cases
available
to
an
indigent
defendant
other
than
by
a
bill
of
exception.
my
point
is
that
it
has
not
done
so.
there
are
states,
a
number
of
states,
at
least
four
in
which
bill
of
exceptions
are
not
taken
away
that
the
review
in
criminal
cases
occurred.
you
can
do
it
on
a
narrative
statement.
you
can
do
it
on
the
judge's
note
but
that
is
not
the
situation
in
illinois
and
what
i
insist
on
the
basis
of
the
illinois
decisions
and
the
decisions
of
its
own
courts
is
that
illinois
provides
no
remedy
for
an
indigent
defendant
who
wants
to
review
trial
errors.
it
admits
it
and
it
says
it's
all
right
for
it
to
do
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
question
which
is
today
before
us.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
we
could
also
note
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
said
petitioners'
sole
contention
is
that
they
were
deprived
of
due
process
et
cetera
and
they
were
--
because
they
were
financially
unable
to
purchase
a
bill
of
exceptions
and
were
therefore
unable
to
obtain
a
complete
review
by
this
court.
this
charge
presents
no
substantial
constitutional
question.
now,
i
think
that
says
we
think
it's
all
right
with
that
situation
exist.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
isn't
that
it
couldn't
be
done
otherwise
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
if
it
--
that
it
was
not
done
otherwise
here.
now,
i
--
i
need
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
it
is
and
an
indigent
defendant
if
he
happens
to
be
sentenced
to
death.
now,
i
--
i
don't
think
i
need
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
developing
the
substantial
nature
of
the
disadvantage
to
the
petitioners
that
results
from
this
inability
to
obtain
a
review,
the
substantiality
of
the
inequality
you
might
call
it.
but
there
are
two
things
i
should
like
to
say,
we
have
collected
a
smattering
statistics
on
the
percentage
of
reversities
in
criminal
appeals
in
a
variety
of
states
and
a
variety
of
times.
in
illinois
for
the
past
50
years
--
and
illinois
happens
to
have
adequate
statistics,
the
attorney
general
keeps
them.
in
illinois
for
the
past
50
years,
the
percentage
of
reversal
in
criminal
appeals
has
run
between
20%
and
40%.
other
states
are
not
substantially
different,
although
they
tend
to
be
a
little
bit
low.
now,
in
order
to
be
sure
that
we
were
not
distorting
the
disadvantage
to
the
petitioner
who
could,
i
will
assume,
appeal
on
a
common
law
record.
we
examined
each
of
the
decisions
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
during
the
last
two
calendar
years
in
1953
and
1954
to
determine
the
basis
upon
which
the
reversals
were
held.
and
in
the
1935,
i
think
it
was,
cases
that
were
there
involved,
we
found
that
with
two
exceptions,
each
reversal
was
on
the
basis
of
trial
error.
the
details
of
that
are
set
out
in
appendix
b
to
the
brief
if
you
are
interested.
the
other
thing
i
should
like
to
say
is
that
although
that
demonstrates
only
what
the
percentage
of
reversal
is
in
cases
which
are
appealed,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right
and
with
--
i
think
it
is
at
least
fair
to
say
that
there
is
at
least
the
similar
likelihood
of
review
of
error
had
there
been
a
review
of
cases
which
could
not
be
appealed
because
the
defendants
were
indigent.
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
and
i
think
it's
important.
in
the
ordinary
case
in
the
illinois
criminal
court,
the
fact
that
there
is
going
to
be
no
appeal
on
trial
error
is
apparent
before
the
proceeding
starts.
when
the
defendant
comes
into
court
and
says
to
the
judge,
"your
honor,
i
have
no
money
to
employ
a
lawyer.
i
wish
you
would
appoint
one
for
me."
now,
whether
he
does
or
not,
he
--
whether
he
gets
a
lawyer,
he
serves
notice
for
all
practical
purposes
that
if
convicted,
he
cannot
review
the
proceedings
which
led
to
his
conviction.
now,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
in
illinois
and
there
would
be
everywhere
judges
and
prosecutors
to
whom
a
situation
of
that
sort
would
be
a
challenge
--
a
challenge
to
be
sure
that
there
was
not
even
the
possibility
of
a
prejudicial
error
in
the
trial
of
a
person
so
situated.
on
the
other
hand,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
in
illinois
and
elsewhere
persons
on
whom
that
situation
would
react
in
a
contrary
way.
that
at
least
is
the
teaching,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
almost
universal
change
from
a
system
of
final
nisi
prius
decisions
in
criminal
cases
to
a
system
of
appeal
in
criminal
cases.
we
did
not
regard
it
as
satisfactory
to
leave
the
final
decision
to
the
district
judge
even
though
--
even
when
we
were
telling
him
that
we
were
going
to
do
it
that
way.
so
i
think
it's
fair
to
state
that
there
is
here
a
substantial
tangible
disadvantage,
there's
difference
in
the
quality
of
justice
which
is
accorded
to
an
indigent
defendant
as
opposed
to
a
non-indigent
defendant
in
illinois.
i
think
that
inequality
is
patent
as
a
fact
and
i
think
it
no
great
step
to
go
to
the
--
to
the
assertion
that
it
is
also
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
let
me
anticipate
a
moment
by
saying
that
i
shall
also
contend
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law,
but
i
should
like
to
reserve
that
point
and
deal
first
with
the
question
of
whether
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
almost
to
go
without
arguing.if
there
is
one
principle
which
we
all
ought
to
accept
as
a
perfectly
certain
principle,
it
is
that
both
rich
people
and
poor
people
should
stand
alike
at
the
bar
of
justice.
magna
carta
itself
declared
to
no
one
will
we
sell,
to
no
one
will
we
refuse
right
or
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
here
we
have
an
example
of
a
patent
country
difference
in
the
quality
of
justice
between
rich
and
poor.
we
are
selling
justice
in
the
sense
that
the
indigent
cannot
purchase
the
same
quality
as
the
rich
man.
now,
the
state
says
well,
we
ought
not
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
that
argument
because
after
all
magna
carta
is
a
goal
only
and
it's
still
a
long,
long
way
off
in
reality.
the
poor
man
suffers
in
criminal
administration,
a
variety
of
hardships.
he
can't
conduct
an
investigation
before
his
trial.
he
may
not
be
able
to
employ
expert
witnesses.
he
may
not
be
able
to
employ
as
good
counsel.
he
may
not
be
able
to
raise
bail
and
substantial
(inaudible)
he
may
have
no
alternative,
real
alternative
when
the
sentence
is
fine
or
imprisonment
and
there
probably
are
a
variety
of
others.
now,
that's
--
the
state
says,
therefore,
why
should
we
worry
about
this
particular
inequality?
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
curious
argument
and
one
which
i
certainly
hope
will
not
appeal
to
this
court.
what
it
says
in
effect
is
that
because
we
cannot
change
all
of
the
inequalities
which
exist
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
in
the
administration
of
criminal
court,
let's
not
concern
ourselves
with
a
particular
inequality
which
we
can
do
something
about.
that
is
not
the
way
i
understand
the
constitution
operates
and
i
certainly
hope
it
is
not
the
way
it
will
operate
in
this
case.
here
is
a
tangible
concrete
disadvantage
which
in
most
states,
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment,
has
been
eliminated.
it
preexists
in
illinois.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
this
court
should
sanction
its
continuation
in
illinois
simply
because
it
cannot
achieve
the
goal
of
magna
carta
in
one
decision.
now,
i
should
also
like
to
spend
just
a
moment
on
the
distinction
which
is
made
in
illinois
between
the
indigent
who
was
sentenced
to
death
and
the
indigent
who
was
not.
we
have
contended
in
our
brief
as
was
contended
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
that
likewise
denies
due
--
equal
protection
of
the
law
to
these
petitioners.
now,
true,
this
court
has
recognized
as
recently
his
last
term
in
the
williams
case,
williams
against
georgia,
that
death
sentences
or
capital
cases
may
be
treated
differently
in
the
law
for
when
the
--
when
the
distinction
between
a
death
sentence
and
a
life
sentence
becomes
relevant.
i
submit
that
although
that
principle
is
true,
it
has
no
application
here.
that
it
ought
not
to
be
a
relevant
consideration
in
determining
the
quality
of
justice
which
an
individual
defendant
is
accorded.
i
see
no
reason
why
illinois
should
be
able
to
say
constitutionally
that
a
man
who
is
sentenced
to
death
may
have
a
full
review
of
the
record
upon
which
that
sentence
rests.
but
the
man
who
is
sentenced
to
99
years
for
murder,
as
was
the
case
in
carter
v.illinois
which
was
reviewed
here
last
two
terms
ago,
is
unable
to
secure
that
kind
of
a
review.
now,
the
state
says
the
answer
to
that
particular
branch
of
our
argument
is
easy.
it's
furnished
by
the
right
to
counsel
cases
which
we
rely
on
in
the
due
process
argument,
they
say
it
supports
then
in
this
aspect
of
the
equal
protection
argument.
the
argument
runs
as
they
may
get
that
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
is
a
distinction
made
in
the
right
to
counsel
rule
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
between
cases
--
between
capital
cases,
i
don't
think
if
death
sentence
is
the
capital
case,
and
non-capital
cases.
and
they
point
to
the
difference
which
the
court
has
announced
from
time
to
time
in
the
line
of
cases
which
begin
with
powell
against
alabama.
i
think
the
difference
does
--
the
argument
doesn't
aid
them
because
i
believe
in
all
of
those
cases
involving
the
right
to
counsel,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
there
is
one
principle
which
will
govern
and
that
is
that
the
defendant
will
not
be
allowed
to
be
prejudiced
by
his
inability
to
employ
counsel.
now,
it
will
--
it
will
find
prejudice
more
easily
in
the
case
of
a
capital
crime.
it
will
find
prejudice
more
easily
in
other
circumstances
but
that
is
one
of
the
factors
which
it
will
look
at.
but
in
no
case
whether
it
be
a
capital
case
or
a
non-capital
case,
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
will
it
permit
a
state
to
refuse
counsel
to
a
defendant,
an
indigent
defendant,
when
he
is
actually
prejudiced.
now,
in
this
case,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
man
who
cannot
appeal
is
actually
prejudiced.
there's
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
justice
which
he
gets
in
illinois.
i
think
the
right
to
counsel
cases
do
not
aid
the
same.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
situation
also
violates
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
that
the
two
clauses
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
think
probably
not,
your
honor.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
think
the
state
--
the
brief
for
the
state
of
illinois
suggests
one
possible
answer,
which
i
would
--
i
would
not
urge
because
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
illinois
procedure
to
be
sure
that
it's
feasible,
but
they
suggest
that
in
the
event
that
this
court
determines
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
deny
an
indigent
defendant
who
wants
to
appeal
a
transcript
to
publish
he
can
base
it
then
the
procedure
of
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
under
which
this
comes
up
might
be
available
by
--
and
supply
the
mechanics
for
testing
those
questions.
under
the
post-conviction
hearing
act,
as
i
explained
before,
the
petitioner
comes
in
and
asserts
his
claim
of
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
the
judge
upon
a
proper
showing
can
order
such
portions
of
the
transcript
printed
as
are
necessary
to
determine
that
right.
now,
conceivably
as
i
read
the
state's
brief,
conceivably
that
is
a
way
in
which
that
question
could
be
raised
by
anyone
imprisoned
in
illinois
now
who
did
not
appeal
because
he
was
unable
to
afford
a
transcript.
i
--
i
think
that
is
one
possibility.
another
possibility
is
that
illinois
would
promptly
do
something
about
it
in
terms
something
like
they
handle
the
right
to
counsel
situation.
they
amended
the
statutes
to
make
--
to
make
clear
what
happened
at
the
time
of
arraignment
and
any
case
coming
up
to
this
court
from
illinois
involving
the
right
to
counsel.
now,
we'll
have
a
transcript
of
the
arraignment
because
of
this
court's
decision.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
this
case
does
not
involve,
your
honor,
the
question
as
to
whether
a
discretionary
permission
to
appeal,
a
discretionary
supplying
of
the
transcript
is
constitutional.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
here
there
isn't
any
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
should
think
it
certainly
has
to
be
one
or
the
other
in
my
view.
now,
whether
or
not
it
can
be
discretionary
is
a
question
which
i
should
think
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
discretion.
i
would
rather
not
argue
it
in
--
in
vacuo
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
but
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
would
not
say
that
it's
clearly
--
i
would
certainly
say
it's
not
clearly
there.
it
makes
--
it
maybe
all
right,
that
is
the
federal
system
as
you
know.
a
transcript
is
furnished
in
the
federal
courts
unless
the
district
judge
certify
that
the
appeal
is
not
taken
in
good
faith.
now,
i
think
that
is
designed
and
probably
does
largely
eliminate
frivolous
appeals
and
then
it
involves
no
violation
of
substantial
right.
there
are
questions
as
to
how
it
operates
in
practice
but
i
would
like
to
reserve
those
questions
until
that
case
comes
before
them.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
--
well,
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
i
certainly
contend
here
only
that
a
failure
to
supply
any
method
by
which
these
petitioners
can
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
secure
a
review
is
bad.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
certainly
would
not
say
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
the
reason
i
say
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
probably
would
be
the
solution
that
would
be
adopted
in
most
cases
is
that
most
cases
have
adopted
that
solution.
let
me
turn
to
the
--
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
due
process
clause.
i
do
not
argue,
and
the
question
is
not
here,
whether
the
due
process
requires
an
appeal
in
every
criminal
proceeding.
that
question
was
not
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
it
is
not
before
this
court.
i
suspect
someday
it
will
be
a
nice
question
but
for
present
purposes
we
need
not
worry
about
it
because
illinois
does
have
a
system
of
criminal
appeal.
it
purports
to
say
in
its
statute
that
writs
of
error
in
criminal
cases
shall
be
writs
of
right
and
shall
issue
of
course.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
state,
once
having
decided
to
establish
a
system
of
criminal
appeal,
must
make
that
system
conform
to
the
due
process
clause
and
that
a
system
which
purports
to
give
to
a
criminal
defendant
a
right
to
appeal
but
which
withholds
it
from
him
when
he
is
without
fund
unless
he'd
be
sentence
to
death
does
not
consist
with
due
process.
now,
it
is
certainly
true
that
what
kind
of
process
in
criminal
appellate
procedures
is
due
process
is
a
very
difficult
question.
there
is
no
touch
to
it.
however,
i
don't
think
the
issue
was
completely
at
large.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
suggested
that
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
concepts
of
fundamental
justice
or
fundamental
fairness
as
determined
from
time
to
time
by
this
court.
and
i
think
that
that
kind
of
an
approach
which
we
can
make
to
this
situation,
to
this
question
is
exemplified
by
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
stone
in
district
of
columbia
against
clawans
in
the
300
united
states
which
i've
quoted
at
page
44
of
my
brief.
he
points
out
that
due
--
what
--
what
constitutes
these
standards
of
fairness
and
justice
may
vary
from
generation
to
generation.
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
doubts
must
be
resolved,
not
subjectively
by
recourse
of
the
judge
to
his
own
sympathy
and
emotion,
but
by
objective
standards
such
as
may
be
observed
in
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
community
taken
as
a
gauge
of
its
social
and
ethical
judgements.
now,
that
i
think
does
not
rule
out
an
examination
of
the
history
of
the
problem.
we
can
certainly
best
understand
where
we
are
if
we
understand
where
we
have
been.
and
in
--
particularly
in
this
situation,
i
think
we
can
best
understand
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
community
to
which
i
will
come
in
a
moment,
if
i
take
a
few
more
minutes
to
explain
a
little
of
the
history
of
the
interrelated
development,
of
protection
of
indigent
criminal
defenses
and
criminal
appeals.
there
are
two
aspects
of
history
of
criminal
procedures
which
i
think
have
a
somewhat
parallel
history.
one
of
them
concerns
the
right
to
counsel.
one
of
them
concerns
the
right
to
appeal.
in
the
right
to
counsel
cases,
in
the
very
early
days
of
england,
there
was
a
complete
equality
between
rich
and
poor,
a
negative
equality,
neither
were
allowed
to
have
counsel
except
only
in
misdemeanor
cases
which
were
sometimes
called
trespasses
and
analogize
to
civil
cases
in
which
counsel
were
permitted
from
the
very
earliest
time.
that
situation
which
seems
literally
incredible
today
preexisted
in
england
until
almost
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
in
the
united
states,
the
colonies
by
1789
were
somewhat
ahead
of
england
and
by
that
time
almost
all
of
them
had
provisions
which
permitted
counsel
to
persons
accused
of
felonies
or
treason.
those
statutes
did
not,
however,
necessarily
employ
that
an
indigent
defendant
to
have
counsel
assigned
to
them.
and
on
that
--
on
that
question,
the
states
varied
quite
widely
as
this
court
elaborately
spelled
out
in
betts
v.brady.
however,
when
the
question
finally
came
to
this
court,
the
court
did
not
feel
bound
by
the
inequities
of
1789.
it
applied
the
principle
which
i
have
just
read
from
chief
justice
stone
and
it
has
now
been
laid
down
by
this
court
that
as
so
far
as
the
right
to
counsel
is
concerned,
indeed
of
the
federal
courts
nor
the
state
courts,
will
an
indigent
defendant
be
permitted
to
be
prejudiced
by
his
financial
inability
to
procure
counsel.
the
line
of
cases
in
the
federal
--
on
the
federal
side
beginning
with
johnson
against
zerbst
and
on
the
state
side
beginning
with
powell
against
alabama,
i
think
i
need
not
detail.
this
situation
with
respect
to
the
right
of
appeal
seems
to
me
comparable,
although
it
is
admittedly
a
considerably
later
development.
again
we
begin
in
early
english
history
with
the
same
negative
sort
of
inequality.
there
were
no
appeals
by
either
the
rich
or
the
poor
in
criminal
cases.
and
again
we
find
that
the
criminal
procedure
lagged
substantially
behind
the
civil
procedure
in
england,
bills
--
writs
of
error
and
bills
of
exceptions
had
been
authorized
in
civil
cases
in
england
in
1295
in
the
statute
of
westminster
second.
but
it
was
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
before
even
writs
of
error
became
generally
available
in
criminal
cases
and
it
was
only
in
1907
when
the
criminal
appeal
act
was
passed
that
england
really
has
accomplished
an
adequate
system
of
criminal
appeal.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
1891.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right,
although
america
did
not
lag
as
far
behind
as
england.
there
were
writs
of
error
in
state
courts
in
--
in
the
states
in
criminal
cases
from
fairly
early
days,
your
honor,
although
bills
of
exceptions
which
make
that
writ
of
error
meaningful
were
sometimes
substantially
later
than
the
initial
grant
of
the
right
of
a
writ
of
error.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
there
was
a
felt
need
for
appellate
review
in
the
courts
but
it
did
not
achieve
a
real
substantially
universal
acceptance,
i
should
say,
within
the
last
50
or
75
years.
i
should
add
in
all
fairness
that
illinois,
in
this
respect,
stands
close
to
the
front
rank.
there
have
been
writs
of
error
and
bills
of
exceptions
for
those
who
could
afford
them
in
illinois
since
1827.
now,
this
growth
of
the
appellate
system
--
of
the
system
of
criminal
appeals
obviously
created
the
potentialities
for
discrimination
between
the
rich
people
and
the
poor
people
who
couldn't
afford
the
appeals.
and
in
fact
because
protections
of
the
indigent
always
tend
to
lag
behind
the
progress,
a
real
inequality
did
develop
and
there
were
substantial
voices
raised
that
criminal
appeal
should
be
abolished
because
the
inequity,
the
patent
glaring
inequity
which
they
supplied
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
just
was
impossible.
the
answer
was
found,
however,
not
in
the
abolition
of
criminal
appeal,
those
had
become
too
well-established
as
part
of
what
we
regard
as
fair
and
just
to
be
abolished.
the
answer
was
found
rather
in
general
enactment
of
provisions
to
protect
the
indigent
in
this
new
appellate
procedure.
now,
it
is
these
statutes,
these
protections,
which
we
believe
supply
the
objective
proof
of
our
present
day
ethical
and
moral
standards
to
which
mr.
justice
stone
referred.
they're
set
out
in
appendix
c
to
our
brief
and
so
far
as
we
could
do
it,
we
have
tried
to
make
them
complete.
in
the
united
states,
there
are
29
states
where
the
indigent
defendant,
upon
proof
of
nothing
but
his
indigence,
is
supplied
with
the
transcript
for
the
purpose
of
his
appeal.
in
some
states,
it
is
done
by
the
state
paying
the
official
reporter.
in
some
states,
it's
done
by
simply
making
that
a
part
of
the
official
reporters
job.
there
are
seven
additional
states
in
which
the
right
of
the
indigent
to
a
transcript
is
discretionary
and
you
add
to
that
group
the
federal
government.
there
are
four
additional
states
in
which
alternative
methods
of
full
criminal
appellate
review
are
provided
without
the
necessity
for
a
transcript
but
in
which
the
indigent
defendant
is
not
prejudiced
by
his
indigence.
there
are
six
states,
of
which
illinois
is
one,
which
limit
the
right
to
cases
of
serious
crimes
but
there
are
only
two
states
which
joined
illinois
in
limiting
it
to
cases
in
which
a
death
sentence
has
been
imposed.
there
are
two
states
about
which
we
were
unable
to
be
certain
and
we
did
not
classify
under
our
two
states
which
provide
no
relief
for
an
indigent
prisoner
so
far
as
we
could
determine.
that
pattern
of
general
acceptance
of
the
principle
that
an
indigent
should
not
be
prejudiced
in
his
right
to
appeal
applies
not
only
in
the
united
states
but
throughout,
so
far
as
we
know,
the
english
speaking
world.
england
and
as
most
of
the
commonwealth
countries,
and
the
references
are
in
the
brief,
supply
a
transcript
or
whatever
is
necessary
to
permit
an
indigent
defendant
to
take
a
full
appeal
and
to
have
a
full
review
without
cost.
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
america,
in
military
courts,
that
has
been
the
practice
since
the
very
beginning.
now,
i
should
like
to
correct
one
inadvertent
error
which
perhaps
i
clause
the
attorney
general.
in
our
appendix
c,
we
entitled
it
the
following
states
provide
free
transcripts
to
all
paupers
convicted
of
felony.
this
case
involves
felony
so
we
examined
other
states
with
regard
to
felony.
the
statutes,
however,
are
not
limited
to
felonies
unless
they
are
specifically
limited
by
the
text
of
appendix
c.
those
statutes
are
equally
applicable
in
any
criminal
appeal
whether
it
be
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor.
i'm
sorry,
the
--
the
title
mislead
mr.
wines.
now,
i
should
like
also
to
advert
just
a
moment
before
i
close
to
one
other
aspect
of
modern
criminal
practice
which
seems
to
me
also
relevant
and
that
is
the
development
of
official
court
reporters
who
are
now,
i
think,
provided
in
substantially
every
state.
before
there
were
official
court
reporters,
the
problem
of
supplying
a
transcript
to
an
indigent
defendant
who
wanted
to
appeal
was
obviously
very
great.
in
the
usual
case,
there
was
no
transcript
made
unless
the
prosecution
itself
happened
to
want
one
for
its
own
purposes
and
consequently
it
was
impossible
to
supply
transcript
to
the
--
to
the
indigent.
the
only
way
to
avoid
that
was
to
have
or
would
have
been
to
have
a
court
reporter,
a
private
court
reporter
attend
every
trial
and
transcribe
it
in
order
that
it
--
the
notes
would
be
available.
i
don't
mean
transcribe
it.
i
mean
take
it
down
in
order
that
the
notes
would
be
available
in
the
event
that
the
defendant
later
did
desire
to
appeal.
that
lead
to
the
fact,
i
think,
that
it
is
--
in
the
federal
courts,
the
day
upon
which
official
court
reporters
were
provided
that
the
federal
government
provided
free
transcripts
for
indigent
defendants.
it
required
that
step
in
the
federal
courts,
a
step
long
delayed
before
it
was
able
to
make
feasibly
this
further
step
available
to
indigent
defendants.
it
is
also
perhaps
significant
on
this
respect
that
in
illinois,
the
date
of
the
statute,
which
grants
a
transcript
free
to
a
person
convicted
of
death,
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death,
dates
from
the
year
in
which
official
court
reporters
were
authorized
in
the
courts
of
that
state.
they
do
exist
now
if
--
as
i
say
in
almost
every
state
and
they
do
in
illinois.
illinois
has
court
reporters,
official
reporters
who
take
down
the
proceedings,
all
the
proceedings
in
all
of
the
regular
criminal
courts.
and
there
are,
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
no
courts
in
which
an
appeal
lies
on
a
bill
of
exceptions
in
which
that
is
not
the
case.
there
are
courts
called
justice
of
the
peace
courts
or
police
courts
throughout
the
state
in
which
proceedings,
criminal
proceedings
may
be
had
but
appeal
in
those
--
from
those
courts
is
on
a
de
novo
basis,
that
a
record
is
not
necessary.
in
chicago,
where
those
courts
are
combined,
the
police
courts
and
the
justice
of
the
peace
--
the
peace
courts
are
combined
into
one
court
called
the
municipal
court
of
chicago.
there
is
provision
for
an
official
record.
now,
it
may
be
said
that
all
of
these
developments
are
so
recent
that
you
cannot
distill
a
constitutional
protection
out
of
that.
true,
they
are
recently
but
we
don't
necessarily,
as
--
as
demonstrated
by
this
court
in
many
cases,
have
to
go
back
to
1789
to
find
out
what
due
process
means.
i
think
we
accept
what
justice
stone
said,
we
look
at
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
community
and
we
look
at
the
question,
which
is
presented
by
this
case,
in
the
light
of
all
of
the
factors
which
are
presently
existing,
the
universality
of
criminal
appeals
recognized
in
every
state,
the
universality
almost
of
protection
for
the
indigent
which
was
made
necessary
by
the
fact
that
those
appeals
were
provided,
the
feasibility
of
the
system
through
the
universal
acceptance
of
court
reporters,
although
let
me
hasten
to
say
i
don't
believe
the
issue
should
defend
on
whether
it
costs
a
lot
or
costs
a
little.
but
when
we
take
all
of
those
things
together,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
say
that
this
situation
presented
by
these
petitioners
is
not
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause.
if
there
were
a
statute
before
your
honors
which
said
in
so
many
words
appeals
in
criminal
cases
are
permitted
in
illinois
only
if
the
person
convicted
has
an
income
of
$10,000,
i
submit
it
would
be
so
patently
unconstitutional
that
it
would
be
reversed
without
arguing.
this
statute
which
accomplishes
exactly
the
same
thing,
$10,000
figure
maybe
wrong
but
which
in
effect
--
in
necessary
effect
denies
to
the
poor
person
the
right
to
appeal
seems
to
me
should
have
the
same
answer.
i
submit
the
decision
should
--
below
should
be
reversed
with
instructions
either
to
afford
this
--
these
petitioner
an
appeal,
a
full
appeal
or
to
dismiss
them
from
custody.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
this
case
is
up
under
the
post-conviction
statute.
i
don't
quite
understand
what
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
effect
you
mean.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
but
let
me
--
let
me
say
this,
a
petition
under
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
is
limited
to
raising
questions
involving
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
now,
let's
assume
that
the
man
says
he
was
imprisoned
because
there
was
a
improper
admission
of
a
confession
obtained
by
threats
and
extortion
from
him.
he
files
a
petition
in
the
illinois
court
and
if
the
showing
is
adequate
the
district
judge
is
the
trial
judge,
the
nisi
prius
judge,
he
files
the
petition
in
the
court
where
she
was
convicted.
that
judge
is
authorized
to
instruct
the
official
court
reporter
to
type
up
such
portions
of
the
transcript
as
are
necessary
to
determine
that
issue
and
that
expense
is
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
said
that
you
can't
use
that
procedure
in
order
to
test
all
sorts
of
trial
errors
which
don't
rise
to
constitutional
dignity,
improper
admission
of
testimony,
improper
charge
to
the
juror,
things
of
that
sort.
you
can't
get
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
procedure
into
a
position
where
all
you're
doing
is
in
effect
having
an
alternative
root
for
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
a
bill
of
exceptions.
that
you
raise
by
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
the
constitutional
question
here
is
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
is
a
different
one.
there's
no
constitution
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
well,
i
should
--
to
be
accurate
i
should
say
that
there
was
one.
it
was
determined
by
the
court
below
to
be
without
sentence
and
it
is
not
here.
that
issue
was
--
is
available
to
the
petitioner
and
they
do
not
raise
any
constitutional
questions
here
because
that
has
been
determined
adversely
too.
the
constitutional
issue
here
is
solely
the
question
as
to
whether
they
are
entitled
to
have
the
non-constitutional
errors
reviewed.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
like
i
said,
your
honor,
was
that
it
applies
both
to
felonies
and
misdemeanor.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
unless
as
in
the
--
on
page
85
or
rather
85
at
the
bottom
where
the
sentence
is
death
or
convicted
of
murder,
it's
specifically
is
limited
to
a
particular
kind
of
a
crime.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i'm
happy
to
have
the
correction,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
have
but
one
very
minor
point.
i
think
i
could
correct
what
i
think
was
an
inadvertence
on
the
part
of
mr.
wines.
you
asked
mr.
justice
reed
whether
the
procuring
of
transcripts
under
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
was
by
statute
or
by
decision
and
mr
wines,
i
think,
replied
that
it
was
by
decision.
if
you
would
look
on
page
77
of
our
brief,
you
will
find
that
it
appears
in
the
part
of
the
illinois
code
dealing
with
the
duties
of
the
official
court
reporter,
hence,
163
(f)
provides
in
the
statute
that
in
cases
arising
under
the
act
there
specified,
which
is
the
post-conviction
hearing
act,
in
which
the
presiding
judge
has
determined
that
the
post-conviction
petition
is
sufficient
to
require
an
answer,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
official
court
reporter
to
transcribe
in
whole
or
in
part
the
stenographic
notes
and
so
forth,
and
it
provides
later
on
that
it
shall
be
paid
for
by
the
state.
i
think
that
was
an
inadvertence
on
his
part.
i
thought
it
should
be
corrected.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
thank
you,
your
honor.
