thank
you.
mr.

chief
justice
earl

i
think
this
is
the
time
to
stop.
we'll
resume
after
the
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wines,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
statement
of
mr.
horsky
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
certain
inequalities
and
opportunities
of
indigent
defendants
to
defend
themselves
which
the
state
has
been
unable
to
iron
out
and
to
make
equal
that
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
maintain
one
that
--
that
is
manifestly
unfair
according
to
both
counsel
in
this
case
and
that
the
state
can
with
propriety
and
with
ease
remedy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
aren't
you
using
evidence
in
two
different
senses
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
whole
record,
this
evidence,
according
to
your
concept
before
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
it
deny
poor
people
every
record,
every
bit
of
evidence
of
that
character?
could
it
deny
him
the
indictment
or
the
arraignment
proceedings
and
the
other
things
which
we
now
do
provide?
chief
justice
earl
warren
constitutionally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
mean
absolutely
no
review,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
trial
at
--
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
no
appellate
review
for
him
at
all
if
he
was
impecunious?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
some
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
some
cases?
chief
justice
earl

you.

this
matter
for
