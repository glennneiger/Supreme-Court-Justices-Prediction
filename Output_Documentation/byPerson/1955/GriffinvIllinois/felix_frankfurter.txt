up

on
the

as
you
call
it,
what
kind
of
legal
question
should
be
raised
on

justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you're
operating?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
common

--
it's
merely
reaching
the
common

justice

under
your
--
as
to

record
in
the
first
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
--
in
this
case,
would
he
get
copies
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
have
copies
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
by
a
statute
or
by
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
each
record
to
have
a
verbatim
transcript
of
the
indictment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
it
doesn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
mean
in
his
book,
i
don't
mean
a
document
that
is
filed.
a
copy
of
the
document
could
go
up
or
is
that
partly
what
--
suddenly
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
more
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it,
it's
very
largely
of
the
dominance,
the
whole
system
of
criminal
appeal
in
england
goes
up
on
judges'
notes,
well-known
that's
the
way
(inaudible)
in
the
countries
and
convinced
in
that
system,
i
believe,
in
which
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
--
he
has
appealed
and
i
think
well
not
merely
a
trial
error
but
he
was
sentenced
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
anything
like
that
in
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
--
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
in
england,
the
trial
judge
takes
full
notice
and
the
appeal
goes
up
on
his
notes
and
that's
precluded
by
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
say
that
it
isn't
a
remedy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
haven't
said
if
that
would
be
inadequate
they
wouldn't
hear
it
on
that,
would
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
not
practical
because
trial
judges
in
illinois
don't
do
what
the
trial
judge
in
england
does
or
because
they
say
we
don't
hear
it
on
merely
in
this
judge's
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
--
well,
from
your
point
of
view
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
stated
the
whole
choice
of
england.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
go
up
on
judge's
notes
because
there
is
a
trial
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
may
have
so
the
transcript
they
made
of
the
stenographic
minutes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
involved
in
the
hearing
is
taken
down
but
the
normal
thing
is
to
go
up
under
careful
notes
of
the
trial
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is,
that
is
certain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
taken
--
i
have
taken
some
of
your
time
and
you
stand
to
prove
that
but
needlessly
of
course
i
should.
your
position
is
we
can
stand
on
what
mr.
justice
schaefer
said
in
that
conduct
in
the
law
of
illinois,
and
we
don't
have
to
challenge
it
beyond
his
authority
to
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
alone
wouldn't
tend
to
all
the
difficulties
i
--
all
the
questions
i
had
as
to
the
mode
of
review
short
of
stenographic
minutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
what
--
what
appears
from
la
frana
is
unqualified
ways
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
takes
care
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
the
illinois
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
--
they
can
get
a
review,
that's
all
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
horsky,
what
cases
would
you
rather
--
on
this
question
of
what
leaves
(inaudible)
assuming
one
goes
along
sympathetically
with
your
argument,
what
duties
are
to
be
drawn
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
the
state?
i
should
(inaudible)
the
power
of
this
court
upheld
this
case,
they
must
give
a
transcript
of
the
record
as
against
what
i
take
it
to
be
a
general
proposition
if
opportunity
for
review
is
given,
the
man
can't
be
drawn
on
whether
a
man
has
money
in
his
pocket
or
not
but
he
must
be
--
the
opportunity,
he
must
be
on
it
for
the
effective
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
make
--
that
gives
you
--
put
it
that
way
rather
than
the
transcript
of
record,
opens
up
all
sorts
of
his
argument
as
i
can
see
it
and
as
an
alternative
in
the
state
in
dealing
with
these
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
from
saying
they
must
give
him
a
transcript
because
the
man
who
--
who
can
have
it
did
not
have
been
(inaudible)
to
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we've
had
none
in
the
federal
courts
we
should
note
until
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might,
i
say,
within
my
life
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
though
prepared
to
say
or
actually
had.
if
you
remember
in
the
federal
court,
the
device
of
(inaudible)
in
having
the
two
judges
disagree
to
a
certificate
and
come
to
this
court
and
get
a
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
mean
--
i
don't
know
why
you'd
insisted
--
why
you
think
that
those
complicated
(inaudible)
illinois
tomorrow
could
abolish
a
review
of
a
criminal
consistent
of
appellate
review
in
criminal
cases
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
away
from
everybody
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
wouldn't
dream
of
doing
it
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wouldn't
dream
of
doing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
wouldn't
dream
of
it.
why
wouldn't
they
dream
of
doing
it?
because
it
seems
essential
to
the
fair
administration
of
justice,
short
of
it,
isn't
it,
that's
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
you
say
that
there
is
an
obvious
discrimination
and
an
obvious
differentiation
between
a
fellow
who
might
go
to
death
and
a
fellow
who
--
he
go
to
get
20
years
or
10
years
or
5
years
or
7
years.
that's
your
position.
is
that
the
fair
classification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
was
to
think
that
that
what
you
deem
vital
to
our
sense
of
justice,
it
is
a
man
who
might
go
to
his
death
is
irrelevant
in
a
case
of
a
man
short
of
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
you
must
say
that
it's
not
irrelevant,
a
fair
thing
to
give
him
a
capital
--
a
capital
offender,
the
opportunity
of
having
the
appellate
court
look
at
it
but
for
the
rest
to
leave
to
the
nisi
prius
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
your
--
that's
what
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
trying
to
take
that
position
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
simply
means
the
court
has
made
a
reconnaissance
review
and
decides
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
thing
a
judge
can
decide
that
congress
says
or
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
my
impression
that
this
is
--
not
a
reasonable
impression
that
is
that
i
think
we
think
before
us,
on
the
whole

the

cases
that
do
go
up
for
review,
the
equivalent
cases

error.
justice

is
that
correct?

directively?

mr.

look

canvas

justice

i

mr.

this

the
first
presents
(inaudible)
concern
in
my
mind
which
i
should
like
to
put
to
you
therefore
it
doesn't
put
you
off
or
prior
to
the
attorney
general
to
state.
i
should
like
before
you
sit
down
to
have
you
address
yourself
to
a
problem
of
the
consequences
of
a
reversal
of
stating
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
not
in
this
case,
not
what
would
happen
in
this
case
in

now
in
joliet

justice

you've
just
said
that
they
couldn't
tell
how
many
indigent

justice

and
therefore
that
means
your
answer
will
be
speculative.
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

contention
of
mine
does
not
necessarily
reach
the
rights
and
the
wisdom,
the
--
the
correctness
of
the
position
you're
taking
on
due
process
and
legal
protection
you
made
there
on

as
far
as
i'm
concerned
on
how
you
should
go
about
it
in
case
we
take
a
view
different
from
yours.
justice

he
modified

said
he's

the
means

to
get
an
effective
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
had
a
lawyer
who
greatly
respected
constitutional
laws
of
illinois.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
see
a
lawyer
--
i
can
see
a
lawyer
saying
--
now
say
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
would
expect
--
we
didn't
expect
every
lawyer
in
illinois
to
challenge
a
law
that's
a
part
of
illinois
courts
and
these
lawyers
thought
was
constitutional.
they're
not
answering
it,
but
i
could
--
