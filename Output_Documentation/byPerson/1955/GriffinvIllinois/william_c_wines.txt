mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
your
honors.
mr.
horsky
is
clear
and
simple
and
complete
in
an
entirely
accurate
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case
as
to
save
me
the
task
and
spared
your
honors
the
labor
of
listening
to
any
further
statement
of
the
facts
on
my
part.
also
i
should
like
to
begin
by
saying
that
mr.
horsky's
outline
and
description
of
illinois
appellate
practice
in
criminal
cases
is
extremely
accurate
and
remarkably
complete.
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
but
of
course
i
am
familiar
with
that
practice
and
if
it's
not
improper
for
me
to
say
so,
it
does
great
credit
to
a
lawyer
who
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
had
a
criminal
case
in
the
state
of
illinois.
so
i
shan't
have
to
duplicate
that.
i
should
like
however
and
i
should
like
to
say
before
addressing
the
constitutional
questions
in
this
case
so
there
won't
be
any
misunderstanding
or
doubt
about
it,
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
joins
me
in
feeling
and
saying
that
the
view
that
every
indigent
prisoner
should
have
--
a
free
transcript
should
have
a
plenary
appellate
review
is
an
enlightened,
humane,
highly
commendable
and
eminently
desirable
point
of
view.
i
should
be
the
last
one
to
try
to
stop
any
prisoner
from
getting
a
free
transcript
if
it
were
otherwise
available
to
him.
there's
no
doubt
about
the
desirability
of
it
at
all
that
i
can
possibly
see.
sometimes
it
said
that
would
impose
an
intolerable
burden
on
reviewing
courts.
my
answer
to
that
would
be
that
if
the
reviewing
courts
find
the
review
of
the
cases
of
poor
people,
intolerable,
the
thirteenth
amendment
protects
them
against
continuing
that
intolerable
task.
however,
the
question
before
this
court,
one
which
i
will
argue
with
all
the
earnest
seriousness
that
i
can,
is
not
whether
it's
desirable
to
give
every
indigent
prisoner
a
transcript
of
record,
a
bill
of
exceptions
raised.
the
important
question
is
deep
question
but
in
one
sense,
one
sense
only,
the
narrow
question
whether
due
process
or
equal
protection
are
of
such
constitutional
exigency
is
to
require
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
inability
of
providing
the
fullest
possible
review
for
all
persons
accused
of
crime
including
free
transcripts
for
the
indigent
at
least,
including
perhaps
the
very
best
of
counsel.
the
question
here,
as
i
was
stating,
is
an
important
one,
a
deep
one
but
it
in
one
sense
a
narrow
one
as
due
process
or
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
require
with
constitutional
authority
the
affording
of
transcripts
free
of
charge
to
those
convicted
persons
who
have
not
the
means
of
otherwise
procuring
them.
before
i
address
that
question,
i
shall
do
my
best
to
answer
two
questions,
factual
questions,
not
factual
about
this
case
but
about
the
illinois
practice
as
to
mr.
horsky
by
mr.
justice
reed.
and
as
i
understood
it
in
slightly
different
fashion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
with
respect
to
the
so-called
bystanders'
bill
of
exceptions
or
the
bill
of
exceptions
prepared
from
someone's
memory
in
condensed
and
narrative
form
and
certified
to
by
the
trial
judge.
as
to
whether
that's
available
in
illinois,
i
can
say
that
everybody
out
there
understands
that
it
is
but
nobody
has
heard
of
its
ever
being
actually
used
in
a
criminal
case
in
illinois
in
recent
years.
i
think
if
you
went
back
before
the
days
of
court
reporting,
you
would
find
some
but
none
today.
and
i
will
say
that
illinois
has
not
suggested
in
the
brief
that
such
a
narrative
transcript
would
necessarily
or
even
generally
be
the
equivalent
of
a
verbatim
transcript
of
all
of
the
trial.
i
should
also
like
to
explain,
so
there
can't
be
any
misunderstanding
about
it,
a
little
more
amply
than
did
mr.
horsky,
although
his
statements
were
quite
accurate
as
far
as
they
went,
how
transcripts
are
procured
when
they
are
procured
under
the
illinois
post-conviction
remedies
act.
that
act,
if
your
honors
please,
is
a
statutory
innovation
in
illinois
enacted,
it's
no
secret
in
response
to
your
honors
decisions
in
cases
from
illinois
and
other
states
in
which
your
honors
declared
that
the
states
must
afford
someway
whereby
in
certain
--
where
there
is
a
substantial
claim
of
denial
of
due
process,
prisoners
rich
or
poor
must
be
afforded
the
means
to
attack
their
convictions
collaterally
by
matters
(inaudible)
the
record
when
for
some
reason
or
other
a
transcript
of
the
record
would
not
make
apparent
those
errors.
well,
under
the
illinois
post-conviction
remedies
act,
a
prisoner
is
required
to
file
a
petition.
it
must
be
sworn
to
at
least
by
himself
and
accompanied
by
such
other
affidavits
as
are
available
or
his
own
affidavit
as
to
why
such
other
affidavits
are
not
available.
and
if
that
question
--
if
that
petition
and
its
accompanying
affidavits,
when
taken
as
true,
make
a
substantial
showing
of
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
--
of
a
constitutional
right
then
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
to
require
a
county
expense,
a
transcript
of
all
or
of
such
portions
of
the
record
of
the
proceedings
at
the
original
trial
as
may
be
necessary
to
present
in
whole
or
to
support
in
part
the
claims
of
constitutional
denial
by
the
prisoner.
that
remedy
is
available
only
to
those
imprisoned
in
the
penitentiary.
we
understand
it
wouldn't
be
available
to
a
person
who
has
served
his
term
but
wanted
relief
from
some
kind
of
civil
disabilities
so
that
he
could
hold
office
or
vote
or
something
of
that
kind,
its
means
of
restoring
liberty
and
not
full
civil
rights.
now,
then
the
situation
in
illinois
with
this
slight
amplification
is
exactly
as
mr.
horsky
has
described
it
to
your
honors
in
his
brief
and
at
the
bar
this
afternoon.
now,
we
address
first
the
contention
--
prisoners
make
two
contentions
with
respect
to
denial
of
due
process.
the
first
contention
that
they
make
is
that
equal
protection
and
due
process
are
denied
because
illinois
does
afford
a
free
transcript
to
all
indigent
prisoners
who
have
received
the
sentence
of
death.
i
don't
mean
in
all
cases
in
which
capital
punishment
might
be
inflicted
but
has
not
given
in
a
particular
case.
in
all
cases
where
the
death
sentence
has
been
imposed,
illinois
does
provide
a
free
transcript.
well,
the
petitioners
say
that
as
long
illinois
provides
free
transcripts
to
indigent
prisoners
sentenced
to
death,
it
denies
equal
protection
if
it
doesn't
provide
free
transcripts
to
indigent
prisoners
who
are
not
sentenced
to
death.
frankly,
i
don't
think
that
question
need
detain
the
court
very
long
with
very
commendable
fairness.
mr.
horsky
concedes
in
his
brief
that
that
question
is
not
as
important
as
the
one
whether
the
review
by
--
of
convictions
of
prisoners
who
have
not
been
sentenced
to
death
or
who
have
the
money
to
get
a
transcript
denies
equal
due
--
protection
or
due
process
when
no
corresponding
right
is
given
to
non-capital
prisoners
who
have
no
money
with
which
to
procure
a
transcript.
your
honors
have
declared
as
recently
as
the
last
term
in
williams
against
georgia
that
in
your
honors
own
language,
"the
difference
between
capital
and
non-capital
offenses
is
the
basis
of
differentiation
in
law
in
diverse
ways
in
which
the
distinction
becomes
relevant."
and
i
think
that
the
differences
between
a
man
who
is
facing
death
and
one
who
is
facing
even
imprisonment
for
the
rest
of
his
life
are
of
such
substantial
significance
that
equal
protection
or
due
process
is
not
denied
if
the
one
is
given
--
the
first
is
given
and
the
second
is
not
given
a
free
transcript
of
proceedings.
the
cases
on
the
right
to
counsel
alone
are
sufficient
to
make
that
clear.
beginning
with
powell
against
alabama,
at
the
latest
in
cases
where
the
death
sentence
has
--
where
capital
punishment
may
be
inflicted
and
with
betts
against
brady
in
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
may
not
be
inflicted,
this
court
has
consistently
and
steadfastly
held,
although
not
without
powerful
dissent,
that
the
requirement
of
counsel
in
a
case
where
the
death
penalty
can
be
inflicted
is
categorical,
it
can't
be
withheld
unless
the
prisoner
knowingly
and
wait
and
understandingly
waives
it
whereas
in
cases
--
in
state
cases
i
mean,
not
federal
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
may
not
be
imposed,
due
process
is
not
denied
by
the
denial
of
counsel
unless
there
is
a
special
showing
of
particular
circumstances
why
counsel
is
needed.
well,
as
long
as
your
honors
hold
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
imperative
and
categorical
in
capital
cases
and
as
contingent
upon
action
will
mean.
in
non-capital
cases,
certainly
the
right
to
a
transcript
or
gratuitous
bill
of
exceptions
is
not
of
anything
like
the
moment
or
at
least
has
never
been
felt
throughout
the
civilized
world
to
be
of
anything
like
the
moment
as
is
the
right
to
counsel.
so
i
shall
not,
unless
requested
to
do
so,
argue
further
the
question
whether
the
fact
that
we
do
give
free
transcripts
to
those
sentenced
to
death
operates
to
deny
equal
protection
to
the
indigent
defendant,
not
capitally
sentenced
who
does
not
have
such
a
record.
i
now
address
the
second
question
in
our
brief
which
is
this.
illinois
conceded
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
but
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
but
they
--
under
your
honors
declarations,
they
could
without
denying
any
federal
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
yes,
i
think
illinois
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
let
me
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
that's
--
that
is
what
i'm
arguing
--
that
is
what
i'm
arguing
and
i
--
i
don't
wish
to
dissemble
the
fact.
i
will
put
it
in
a
--
i'll
put
it
in
this
fashion,
if
i
may,
with
your
honors
indulgence.
i
think
so
far
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
other
federal
constitutional
right
is
concerned,
if
illinois
chose
to
do
so,
it
could
tomorrow
abolish
all
appellate
review
except
in
capital
--
in
cases
where
the
death
sentence
had
been
imposed.
and
i
certainly
think
it
could
do
something
--
and
i
certainly
think
it
could
do
something
else
that
it
might
do
as
it
is
now
all
felony
cases
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
with
no
--
with
no
stop
at
our
intermediate
appellate
court.
all
misdemeanor
cases,
unless
they
involve
constitutional
questions
that
are
substantial,
go
to
the
appellate
court
and
then
to
the
supreme
court.
i
certainly
think
that
illinois
could
if
it
chose,
if
she
chose
tomorrow,
limit
appellate
review
to
the
appellate
courts
of
illinois
except
in
cases
where
the
death
penalty
had
been
imposed
and
there
give
either
--
give
a
review
by
the
supreme
court
either
after
or
without
the
appellate
court's
intermediacy.
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
actually,
the
truth
about
the
matter
is
in
illinois
that
the
right
to
a
writ
of
error
is
a
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
on
some
kind
of
a
record,
common
law
or
full
stenographic
record
is
absolutely
and
everything
except
capital
cases
because
there
is
no
such
right
in
capital
cases
unless
you'll
get
a
stay
of
proceedings
from
the
supreme
court
before
execution
and
you
are
not
entitled
to
that
stay
as
a
matter
of
right
and
until
quite
recently
it
was
frequently
denied.
so
the
actual
practice
in
illinois,
i
am
sorry
to
say
but
it
is
a
fact,
has
been
that
the
fellow
who
has
a
transcript
and
gets
life
is
sure
of
a
review
by
supreme
court
of
illinois
but
the
fellow
who
has
the
transcript
and
gets
death
has
to
get
a
stay
of
the
sentence
and
he's
not
entitled
to
it
as
a
matter
of
right
and
it
has
been
denied.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
but
it
isn't
the
full
review
by
all
of
the
justices
that
you
would
otherwise
get.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
has
to
get
the
concurrence
of
four
to
grant.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
but
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
now,
i
turn
to
what
everybody,
i
believe,
recognizes
as
the
even
more
serious
question
here
through
--
rises
from
the
fact
that
take
now
only
non-capital
cases.
the
illinois
prisoner
who
can
afford
a
bill
of
exceptions
can
obtain
it
and
if
he
is
convicted
of
a
felony
or
of
a
misdemeanor
in
which
there
is
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
or
some
other
substantial
constitutional
question,
he
may
go
by
a
writ
of
error
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
illicit
that
court's
review.
on
the
record,
illinois
practice
requires
that
the
record
be
abstracted
by
counsel
but
the
actual
record
is
also
supplied,
briefs
of
counsel
and
oral
argument
if
requested.
if
he
is
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
with
no
constitutional
question
involved,
he
goes
first
to
the
appellate
court.
and
if
he
suffers
affirmance
there,
he
has
a
writ
of
error
which
is
a
writ
of
right
to
the
supreme
--
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
where
he
may
go
without
the
equivalent
of
petition
for
certiorari
but
by
the
equivalent
of
direct
appeal.
now,
by
and
large,
there
isn't
any
way
that
an
illinois
convicted
person
can
--
in
a
non-capital
case
can
obtain
a
bill
of
exceptions
without
paying
for
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
last
statement
is
almost
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
only
exception
is
we've
mentioned
that
mr.
--
mr.
horsky
and
i
have
both
mentioned
and
that
is
under
the
post-conviction
remedies
act.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
--
if
he
can
make
a
substantial
showing
to
the
trial
judge
that
his
conviction
was
a
result
of
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
order
the
entirety
or
so
much
as
he
deems
necessary
of
the
transcript
at
the
county's
expense.
mr.
william
c.
wines
any
crime.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
overwhelming
might
be
too
strong
a
word
but
certainly
the
majority.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
an
overwhelming
majority
but
it
would
be
a
majority.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor,
this
--
this
petition
is
--
is
--
presents
the
question
in
a
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
page
2
of
the
record?
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
take
that
to
mean
and
mr.
horsky
takes
it
to
mean
from
his
statement
at
the
bench
--
at
--
at
the
bar
this
morning
that
the
prisoners
do
not
contend
that
their
conviction
up
to
the
time
of
the
return
of
the
verdict
and
the
imposition
of
sentence
was
infected
with
a
constitutional
error,
that
it
was
of
a
non-constitutional
or
as
that
the
error
of
complaint,
now,
which
is
nowhere
specified,
was
of
a
non-constitutional
or
perhaps
you
can
coin
the
words
sub-constitutional
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
think
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
when
they
were
denied
a
transcript,
i
--
i
take
it
to
mean
if
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
present
sub-constitutional
errors
if
anybody
else
has
that
right.
in
other
words,
i
understand
the
man
to
say
whether
my
--
the
error
that
i'm
complaining
of
is
or
is
not
a
constitutional
error.
if
it's
an
error
at
all,
i
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
transcript
to
show
it
as
long
as
i
could
get
such
a
transcript
if
i
had
the
means
to
procure
it.
and
at
least
that's
the
way
it's
treated
by
the
petitioners
in
this
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
the
--
that
--
and
--
and
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
it's
by
decisions
of
the
courts
under
the
post-conviction
statute.
mr.
william
c.
wines
not
in
so
many
terms
--
words,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes
and
by
the
practice
and
mr.
--
since
mr.
horsky
concedes
it,
i
haven't
reach
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
the
particular
cases
that
--
that
recognized
it
but
there's
no
doubt
that
it's
there.
now,
your
honors,
addressing
the
question
that
i
have
stated.
it's
an
unfortunate
fact
that
in
very
many
respects
those
accused
and
convicted
of
crime
suffer
palpable
and
grave
disadvantages
in
proportion
to
the
paucity
of
their
means.
one
of
the
first
distinctions
recognized
frankly
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
mentioned
in
the
respondent's
brief
is
the
matter
of
bail.
but
the
very
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
--
in
its
text,
not
in
--
it's
glossed
by
this
court
but
in
its
text
provides
that
excessive
bail
shall
not
be
required.
well,
a
man
with
no
money,
no
friends
with
money,
can't
give
any
bail,
he
can't
give
a
bail
of
a
dollar
and
there's
many
--
a
literally
penniless
man
picked
up
on
the
streets
for
small
offenses
no
doubt
but
nevertheless
picked
up
who
couldn't
give
a
bail
of
25
cents.
other
gives
bail
as
high
as
a
$100,000,
i've
even
heard
of
a
sum
of
half
a
million
or
my
memory
may
claim
me
false
there.
so
right
in
the
four
corners
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
a
recognition,
a
distinction
between
the
impecunious
and
the
opulent.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes
and
also
his
standing
in
the
community.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
have
to.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
say
that
it's
required.
i
say
that
it's
recognized
and
--
and
indirectly
condoned,
certainly
by
--
by
the
constitution.
i
don't
say
that
the
constitution
says
that
the
--
the
court
shall
discriminate
against
the
poor
but
it
--
it
recognizes
a
practice
and
we
all
know
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
impecunious
have
more
trouble
generally
in
giving
bails
than
do
the
opulent.
that
is
certainly
true.
there
are
exceptional
cases
where
a
penniless
person
is
so
well-thought
of
by
his
community
that
anybody
will
give
bail
for
him
and
somewhere
a
--
a
rich
man
is
such
a
miscreant
that
nobody
would
sign
his
bail.
but
i'm
not
talking
about
the
--
the
exceptional
case
anymore
than
mr.
horsky
is
talking
about
the
exceptional
case
where
the
american
civil
liberties
union
might
get
the
fellow
a
transcript
as
they
have
done
in
some
cases.
but
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
case,
certainly,
the
wealth
of
a
defendant
isn't
financial
means
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
whether
he
makes
bail
or
not.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
the
desirable,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
latter,
i
can't
say
so
much
about
what
would
be
tolerated,
but
the
--
but
the
desirable,
no.
i
--
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
to
the
extent
that
things
--
it
--
it's
regrettable
that
financial
embarrassment
can
play
any
part
in
the
assertion
or
vindication
of
any
right
in
any
criminal
or
civil
case.
i
--
i
don't
want
again
say
that
for
a
moment,
but
i
am
--
the
argument
that
i'm
pursuing
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
a
giving
of
a
bill
of
exceptions
and
i
have
mentioned
the
matter
of
bail
as
one
example
where
the
constitution
at
least
contemplates
the
solvency
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
or
his
friends
as
a
condition
to
his
release
unless
the
judge
happens
to
want
to
release
him
on
his
own
recognizance.
another
distinction
that
i
should
like
to
mention
that
is
certainly
tolerated
not
only
throughout
the
united
states
but
throughout
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
and
that
is
the
matter
of
the
expiation
of
offenses
by
imprisonment
where
the
defendant
doesn't
have
the
means
to
pay
a
fine.
now,
under
illinois
law,
for
example
and
this
is
regrettable,
fineable
offenses
are
atoned
for
an
imprisonment
for
a
dollar-and-a-half
for
--
a
day
and
a
--
a
days
imprisonment
for
every
dollar-and-a-half
of
the
fine.
well,
we
have
computed
that
an
indigent
defendant
in
illinois
who
is
fined
$10,000
has
to
serve
17
years
in
the
county
jail
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
means
for
cutting
that
down.
there
may
be
one
sort
of
a
pardon.
but
at
least
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
can
pardon.
he
can
pardon
the
man
for
not
having
a
free
transcript
too.
the
governor's
pardon
is
--
is
always
there
to
correct
any
injustice,
but
i
don't
think
then
of
itself
suffices
to
assure
equal
protection
or
due
process
since
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
pardon.
now,
there
are
other
ways
in
which
the
indigent
suffer.
we'll
take
the
case
of
a
man
who's
indicted
for
an
offense.
we'll
make
it
a
non-capital
offense
so
we
don't
have
this
complicating
factor
of
a
free
bill
of
exceptions
if
he's
sentenced
to
be
electrocuted
and
not
if
he
isn't.
the
first
thing,
illinois
law
guarantees
that
he'd
be
furnished
the
names
of
the
--
of
the
jurors,
the
panel
of
the
jury,
so
that
he
can
investigate
to
find
out
whether
there
are
type
or
a
like
to
be
prejudiced
for
him
or
against
him
or
neutral
and
those
investigations
are
very
expensive,
particularly
if
the
crime
or
alleged
crime
is
one
that's
attracted
a
lot
of
attention
and
that's
a
small
county
and
everybody
in
the
county
has
read
and
heard
about
it.
well,
to
the
defendants,
many
of
these
cases,
many
of
the
crimes
arise
out
of
labor
violence
where
labor
leaders
are
indicted
and
they
have
the
--
plenty
of
money
behind
them.
they
investigate
every
juror.
the
man
in
jail
without
bond,
perhaps
a
lawyer
hasn't
even
been
appointed
for
him
and
isn't
appointed
until
the
term
of
court
where
he's
arraigned,
commences
which
maybe
some
weeks
off
down
state
has
no
means
of
investigating
those
jurors,
none
whatever
except
to
ask
other
prisoners
in
the
cell
block
if
they
ever
heard
of
any
them,
that's
the
limit
of
his
means
of
investigating,
whereas
the
affluent
defendant
can
employ
counsel.
i'm
talking
only
about
legitimate
investigations,
not
any
--
any
illegitimate
approaches
to
jurors.
he
can
--
he
can
employ
train
investigators.
he
can
ransack
everything
from
their
birth
certificates
to
their
eighth
grade
diplomas
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
done
and
for
prying
an
important
criminal
trial
especially
down
the
state
in
illinois.
mr.
william
c.
wines
did
your
honor
finish
the
question?
mr.
william
c.
wines
thank
you.
all
right,
my
answer
to
it
will
be
direct
but
it
will
take
me
three
or
four
sentences
and
those
sentences
are
as
follows.
and
answering
your
question
to
which
i
was
just
coming
anyway
was
mentioning
the
fact
that
the
impecunious
don't
in
general
have
the
means
of
getting
evidence
particularly
in
this
connection
documentary
exhibits
that
the
affluent
or
opulent
has.
now,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
if
you
look
at
it
functionally
and
in
terms
of
its
operation
and
not
its
characterization,
a
stenographic
transcript
is
simply
one
species
of
evidence.
it's
evidence
in
the
reviewing
court
of
what
occurred
in
the
lower
court.
it's
like
any
other
documentary
evidence.
the
reviewing
court
wants
to
know
what
happened
in
the
trial
court,
evidence
to
the
reviewing
court
of
what
happened
in
the
trial
court
is
called
variously
a
bill
of
exceptions,
report
of
proceedings,
stenographer's
transcript
or
what
not.
now,
since
it's
not
suggested
by
anyone,
certainly
not
by
petitioner
to
mr.
horsky
in
this
case,
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
any
other
documentary
evidence
compiled,
may
be
he
can
subpoena
if
it's
there
and
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
but
since
he's
not
entitled
to
have
witnesses
brought
from
--
without
the
state
at
state
expense
or
he's
not
entitled
to
have
any
other
kind
of
documentary
evidence
prepared
with
stenographic
services
supplied
free.
he
is
not
entitled,
we
say
as
a
constitutional
one,
to
have
this
particular
species
of
evidence,
namely,
the
evidence
to
the
reviewing
court
of
what
happened
in
the
lower
court
compiled
rates.
now,
your
honor
has
said
that
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
technically,
yes.
in
--
in
practical
logic,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
now,
your
honor
has
indicated
there,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
my
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
my
--
the
--
the
logic
of
my
position
forces
me
to
answer
that
question,
yes.
we
say
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no
appellate
review.
mr.
william
c.
wines
now,
in
as
much
as
due
process
doesn't
require
appellate
review,
i
do
not
--
at
all
i
do
not
see
why
equal
protection
requires
it
to
be
provided
free
of
charge
unless
equal
protection
requires
that
all
other
advantages
that
affluent
or
opulent
defendants
enjoy
so
requires.
and
i
would
like
to
--
still
answering
the
court's
question
at
the
same
time
resuming
the
main
burden
of
my
argument.
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
shown
in
the
appendix
--
now,
mr.
horsky
has
corrected
it
but
in
a
way
that
i
don't
quite
understand.
the
appendix
in
mr.
horsky's
brief
at
page
84
contains
this
heading,
the
following
states
provide
free
transcripts
to
all
paupers
convicted
of
felonies.
now,
he
says
at
the
bar
that
he
doesn't
mean
felonies
and
that
it
--
it
has
to
do
with
all
convictions.
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
some
cases
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
at
85,
the
following
stanza
states
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
understand
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
he
did
correct.
maybe
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
maybe
i
could
yield
him
--
could
i
yield
a
minute
of
my
time
so
that
he
could
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
all
of
these
states?
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
it
appears
from
page
85
that
six
states
restrict
the
grant
of
a
free
transcript
for
certain
types
of
cases.
now,
i
submit
that
if
there
is
virtue
and
merit
at
all
in
petitioner's
contention,
it
must
apply
not
only
to
all
cases
of
felony.
i
submit
that
if
there's
virtue
and
merit
at
all
in
petitioner's
contention,
it
must
apply
not
of
only
to
all
cases
of
felony
but
certainly
to
all
cases
that
may
ultimate
an
imprisonment
whether
either
by
direct
mandatory
sentence
of
imprisonment
or
by
imprisonment
as
alternative
to
an
unpaid
and
unpayable
fine.
now,
the
chief
justice's
question,
as
i
understood
it
and
i'm
sure
he
will
correct
me
if
i
have
misphrased
the
question,
indicates
that
the
situation
in
the
particular
case
of
free
transcripts
is
one
that
might
be
procured
readily
or
easily.
let
me
assure
the
court
that
(inaudible)
is
familiar
from
the
case
particularly
if,
as
i
think
the
logic
of
mr.
horsky's
argument
requires,
we
take
into
account
all
cases
where
imprisonment
may
eventuate.
in
illinois,
there
are
official
court
reporters
who
take
down
the
shorthand
but
they'll
transcribe
without
paying
them
in
all
felony
cases.
now,
mr.
horsky
is
mistaken
about
misdemeanor
cases
at
least
in
the
municipal
court
of
chicago
and
in
numerous
--
perhaps
not
in
magnitude
of
sentences
but
in
numbers
of
persons
convicted,
more
people
are
sentenced
to
some
kind
of
confinement
from
the
municipal
court
of
chicago,
i'm
quite
sure,
than
from
any
other
court
in
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor,
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
means
that
i
would
--
that
i
would
know
of
or
finding
out
indigent
in
this
respect.
the
fact
that
a
man
has
a
lawyer
to
represent
him
on
the
trial
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
has
the
money
for
a
transcript.
so
i
do
know
this
that
lawyers
fees
being
what
they
are,
the
number
of
indigent
prisoners
after
conviction
is
considerably
larger
than
the
number
of
indigent
prisoners
before
conviction
because
in
between
times
they
pay
attorney's
fees.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'll
do
that
right
now,
your
honor.
it's
very
important
and
naturally
it's
a
matter
to
which
i
have
given
great
thought
which
does
not
mean
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no
way
in
the
world
they
could
tell
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
we
--
if
we
knew
the
number
who
appeared
without
counsel,
we
wouldn't
know
how
many
of
them
wanted
counsel
and
how
many
of
them
didn't
and
if
we
knew
--
knew
the
number
who
had
counsel
on
a
trial,
we
wouldn't
know
how
many
had
--
had
enough
money
after
paying
their
lawyer
to
get
a
bill
of
exceptions
and
they
wouldn't
do
it
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
reliable
way
of
finding
out.
now,
with
respect
to
the
consequences
of
a
--
of
a
reversal
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
--
i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
understand
your
honor.
first,
may
i
say
that
i
think
it
does
bear
very
cogently
upon
the
constitutional
question
itself
for
this
reason,
that
while
there
are
some
constitutional
commands
such
as
from
the
federal
constitution
that
must
have
a
trial
by
jury
or
the
private
property
may
not
be
taken
without
just
compensation
that
it
have
to
be
where
the
--
if
the
constitution
commands
something,
that
command
must
abided
regardless
of
cost,
therefore,
i
think
everyone
knows.
but
whether
the
constitution
does
command
something,
when
that
is
in
doubt,
may
well
depend
upon
practical
feasibility
because
the
fact
that
it
can't
be
supposed
that
the
framers
of
the
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
attended
--
intended
to
create
any
right
that
they
may
have
known
would
not
be
feasible
of
realization.
so
for
that
reason,
i
think
practical
consequences
are
of
constitutional
moment
on
this
argument.
well,
your
honor
--
if
your
honors
should
reverse
this
case
and
say
that
every
prisoner
was
entitled
either
to
a
free
transcript
or
to
his
liberty
which
is
what
mr.
horsky
asks
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
if
you
said
it
means
whereby
he
can
get
an
effective
review,
he
would
first
get
--
you
would
first
reach
the
question
what
would
be
equal
protection
assuming
that
a
bystanders'
bill
of
exception
is
available
and
would
satisfy
due
process
that
it
satisfy
equal
protection
when
the
opulent
defendant
can
get
the
full
transcript?
but
let's
suppose
for
a
moment
that
he's
entitled
to
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
--
that
the
opulent
defendant
is
which
is
a
complete
merit
whether
he
needs
it
or
not,
then
you
would
have
as
practical
matter,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question
as
honestly
as
i
can,
you
would
have
--
i
would
say
several
thousand
illinois
prisoners,
certainly
many
hundreds
who
are
now
indigent
--
who
are
now
indigent,
the
times
of
their
conviction
would
range
from
two
or
three
weeks
ago
to
as
long
as
20
years
or
30
years
ago.
most
of
those
indigent
prisoners
would
not
have
made
a
motion
as
did
these
indigent
prisoners
for
a
bill
of
exceptions
within
the
time
allowed
by
illinois
law
which
is
not
--
is
100
days.
but
then
you
would
get
to
the
question
if
their
pauperism
deprived
them
not
only
of
this
bill
of
exceptions
but
of
counsel
to
advise
them
of
the
need
for
it,
you
would
then
get
--
you
would
then
have
this
kind
of
a
situation,
you
would
have
a
prisoner
who
was
convicted
in
19
--
make
it
10
years
ago,
he
was
convicted
in
1945
and
he's
been
given
life
for
burglary,
at
that
time
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
he
--
the
100
days
in
which
he
can
ask
for
a
bill
of
exceptions
has
long
since
gone
by
and
he
didn't
ask
what
within
the
100
days,
but
he
now
says,
“well,
i
was
poor,
i
was
a
pauper
and
i
not
only
should
have
had
a
bill
of
exceptions,
i
should
have
had
a
lawyer
to
advise
me
that
i
have
a
right
to
a
bill
of
exceptions
and
that
totals
100
days.”
and
you
would
then
get
that
problem
if
i
make
the
problem
clear
without
expecting
the
emanation
of
any
answer
to
it.
so
you
couldn't
just
say,
if
you
just
chopped
it
off
with
the
right
to
a
transcript,
every
prisoner
who's
been
in
there
more
than
100
days
and
hasn't
move
for
transcript
has
waived
his
rights,
but
he
will
say,
“well,
i
didn't
know
i
had.
i
think
the
reason
i
didn't
know
i
had
any
was
i
didn't
have
a
lawyer
and
the
reason
i
didn't
have
a
lawyer
was
i'm
too
poor
to
get
one.”
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
if
he
had
a
lawyer
of
his
own
choice
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
that
lawyer
didn't
advise
him,
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation,
entirely
different.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
--
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
can
imagine
that
argument
too.
so
i
will
say
this.
that
in
the
case
of
many
--
of
the
--
i'm
--
i'm
dealing
with
practicalities
because
as
to
in
the
case
of
many
of
the
men
who
have
been
there
a
long
time
and
whose
behavior
hasn't
been
such
as
to
earn
them
any
parole
or
consideration
from
anybody,
there
won't
be
any
way
to
get
them
a
transcript
because
the
court
reporter
will
have
died
or
lost
the
ability
to
read
notes
or
the
notes
will
not
be
available
or
removed.
the
older
transcripts
--
how
long
you
can
get
a
transcript
just
depends
on
how
long
the
stenographer
is
available
to
transcribe
his
or
her
notes,
when
that's
gone,
the
transcript
is
gone
for
all
practical
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
purposes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
everybody
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
a
bystanders'
bill
is
actually
been
tendered
to
the
judge,
trial
judge
for
approval.
the
cases
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
think
mr.
horsky
said
exactly
that,
i
think
what
mr.
horsky
said,
i'm
sure
what
he
meant
was
this.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
carter
against
illinois,
which
reached
this
court,
was
one
of
them
where
the
prisoners
have
themselves
written
out
a
narrative
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
la
frana,
l-a-f-r-a-n-a.
mr.
william
c.
wines
la
frana.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
that
means
that
he
couldn't
get
a
full
stenographic
transcript.
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
take
a
bystanders'
bill
if
the
trial
judge
would
certify
it.
i'm
not
so
certain
that
the
trial
judges
in
illinois
would
actually
certify
it
not
because
they
want
to
hurt
poor
people
but
because
it'd
be
very
difficult
to
draw
up
one
that
would
satisfy
the
judge
as
being
a
complete
statement
of
the
case
and
even
if
he
did
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
even
if
he
did
that
it
wouldn't
be
the
equivalent
of
a
--
of
a
stenographic
transcript.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
quite
certain
that
if
this
court
ever
held
that
as
long
as
equal
--
as
long
as
anybody
could
get
a
stenographic
bill
of
exceptions,
everybody
is
entitled
to
at
least
a
bystanders'
bill
that
it
wouldn't
be
long
until
those
bystanders'
bills
would
be
recognized
in
--
by
the
illinois
courts.
this
court
should
so
hold
but
at
present,
as
i
say,
i
have
never
heard
it.
i
see
that
my
time
has
very
nearly
expired
unless
your
honors
have
some
further
questions,
i'll
submit
the
