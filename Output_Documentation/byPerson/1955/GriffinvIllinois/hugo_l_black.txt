justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it's
conceded
that
everyone
except
an
indigent
defendant
can
get
a
review
in
the
supreme
court
of
trial
error.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
mr.
horsky
is
right
in
saying
that
under
the
law,
as
he
has
to
construe
it
now,
illinois
is
bound
to
provide
a
full
review
of
trial
error
in
every
defendant
convicted
in
the
state
that
has
enough
money
to
buy
a
bill
of
exceptions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
denied
it
to
every
person
who
is
too
poor
to
buy
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
can
he
get
it
under
the
post-conviction
remedies
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
then
correct
as
i
understand
it,
illinois
permits
every
person
who
has
the
money,
enough
money
to
buy
a
bill
of
exception
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
outside
the
capital
to
get
--
to
take
it
to
the
supreme
court
to
have
trial
errors
reviewed,
both
constitutional
and
all
other
kinds
of
it.
but
if
he's
too
poor
to
buy
one,
he
cannot
have
trial
--
any
trial
error
reviewed
however
grave
it
is
unless
it's
a
constitutional
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
that
problem,
mr.
wines,
might
the
amount
of
bail
depend
somewhat,
at
least
i
have
thought
it
did
but
it
would
seem
a
judge
would
decide
it,
on
how
much
bail
the
man
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
give
in
consideration
of
his
poverty
or
his
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
life
stability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
sometimes
he
gets
recognized
without
bail
because
he's
unable
to
make
it
i
suppose?
i've
seen
that
happen
in
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
i
wouldn't
suppose
that
you
could
say
that
that
inequality
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution
provision
that
excessive
bail
shall
not
be
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
imagine
that
usually
when
that
statement
was
made
in
this
country,
it's
probably
made
whether
pretty
severe
criticism
of
--
of
any
system
that
permits
that,
is
it
not?
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
charge,
frequently
that
in
certain
places
and
under
certain
circumstances
the
--
the
rich
have
an
easier
chance
to
get
out
in
the
floor,
but
i've
heard
others
better
to
deny
that
under
our
system
that
certainly
it's
what
they
intended
that
way.
do
you
think
that
could
recognize
that
it
was
accepted
among
the
people
whether
desirable
or
governmental
practice
or
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
one
which
will
be
tolerated
if
the
people
could
get
a
chance
to
speak
their
voice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
governor
has
the
right
to
do
something,
doesn't
he?
