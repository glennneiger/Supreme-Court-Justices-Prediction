justice
stanley
reed
is
there
--
justice
stanley
reed
are
you
finished?
justice
stanley
reed
is
there
anything
in
--
in
illinois
law
that
you
know
of
that
provides
for
a
bill
of
exceptions?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
statutory?
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
justice
stanley
reed
is
it
provided
by
a
statute
or
a
decision
of
illinois
that
the
bill
of
exception
may
only
go
up
in
the
way
that
you've
described
it?
justice
stanley
reed
i'm
thinking
of
a
bystander
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
as
i
understand
the
common
law
under
the
law
in
some
of
the
states.
justice
stanley
reed
is
--
is
counsel
part
of
his
--
the
indigent
when
he
wants
to
go
up
this
way?
justice
stanley
reed
in
illinois.
justice
stanley
reed
some
cases
and
some
not?
justice
stanley
reed
does
it
go
--
does
the
counsel
that
represents
the
petitioner
or
the
petitioner
here
in
the
trial
court,
it's
his
duty
to
follow
it
through
to
the
court
of
--
supreme
court
of
illinois?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
--
what
i
have
in
mind
is
this,
mr.
horsky.
if
somebody
has
to
state
why
there
was
an
error
in
the
case
in
the
trial
and
the
facts
would
seem
to
be
quite
simple
in
the
normal
case
and
every
case
like
that
as
to
what
the
error
was,
and
he
states
if
he
(inaudible)
of
what
the
--
what
the
error
of
law
is
and
the
facts
which
lead
to
it.
now,
he's
at
least
has
to
state
that
question
before
the
supreme
court
can
pass
on
it.
can
he
take
that
before
the
judge?
how
is
that
certified
as
a
transcript
relating
to
that
particular
matter?
justice
stanley
reed
oh,
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
with
that
but
what
--
what
will
lead
you
to
think?
what
has
illinois
said
that
would
keep
that
from
happening?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
without
bill
of
exceptions
that
goes
many,
many
years
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
longer
than
we
had
them.
justice
stanley
reed
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
perhaps
because
they
didn't
have
the
certificate
of
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
i'm
assuming
is
it's
typical
a
judge
would
say
these
were
the
facts
of
the
development
in
trial.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
to
which
counsel
have
thought
there
was
error
below.
justice
stanley
reed
before
--
before
you
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
go
on
that,
what
--
what
is
--
what
is
the
practical
result
of
this
that
this
court
would
set
aside
all
the
convictions
of
a
trial
court
in
illinois
until
they
did
furnish
the
record?
justice
stanley
reed
you
mean
that
they
mean
there'd
be
a
shifting
of
the
claims
by
the
trial
court
and
only
a
record
will
be
furnished
when
the
trial
court
thought
it
desirable?
justice
stanley
reed
it
must
be
either
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
it
must
be
either
discretionary
or
absolute
when
decided.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
i'm
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
i'm
not
arguing
down
there,
i'm
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
horsky,
what
--
what
is
the
effect
of
the
post-conviction
statute
of
illinois,
are
you
familiar
with
that?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
was
thinking
--
as
i
the
post-conviction
statute,
there
are
ways
of
determining
whether
the
person
who
wants
to
take
a
post-conviction
may
or
may
not
get
a
transcript.
justice
stanley
reed
if
this
was
under
that
statute,
why
--
why
didn't
they
get
it
here?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
there's
no
constitutional
question
here?
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
think
there's
another
constitutional
--
justice
stanley
reed
but
what
--
no
constitutional
question
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
justice
stanley
reed
how
in
this
--
in
this
present
case,
was
a
relief
sought
on
the
constitutional
ground?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
then
what
--
what
is
the
statement
on
page
2
of
the
record
mean?
the
plaintiff
in
error
was
denied
a
hearing
relief
for
constitutional
error.
justice
stanley
reed
first
full
paragraph.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
let's
say
it
was
a
constitutional
error
which
occurred
in
the
proceeding.
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you
interpret
that
to
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
that's
right.
now,
where
is
the
authority
that
would
give
them
a
right
to
their
record
if
they
alleged
a
constitutional
error?
justice
stanley
reed
you
say
it's
in
the
post
--
post-conviction
statute
but
i
--
justice
stanley
reed
or
is
it
by
a
decision
of
the
court,
supreme
court
of
illinois?
justice
stanley
reed
it's
not
provided
for
in
the
statute?
justice
stanley
reed
but
it
is
provided
for
by
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
do
you
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
what
do
you
say
about
the
right
to
a
bystander's
bill
in
the
illinois
courts.
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
--
do
you
accept
the
argument
of
mr.
horsky
that
the
court
has
said
that
they
wouldn't
hear
it
on
bystanders'
bill?
justice
stanley
reed
tell
me
you've
cited,
what
was
it,
la
fano
or
la
fada?
justice
stanley
reed
la
frana
--
la
frana.
justice
stanley
reed
and
since
he
was
precluded
by
indigence
from
securing
a
direct
review
of
his
conviction,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
stanley
reed
they
mean
he
--
draw
it
up
himself?
justice
stanley
reed
no,
but
the
argument
here
is
not
what
kind
of
an
appeal
you're
entitled
to
or
what
kind
of
a
--
of
a
record
but
that
you're
entitled
to
something,
you're
entitled
to
some
way
to
make
your
appeal
and
to
have
a
bill
of
exceptions
to
raise
the
points
that
you
have
in
mind.
that's
--
that's
all
i
understand
they
say.
justice
stanley
reed
not
--
not
that
you're
entitled
to
all
cases
and
everytime
to
have
a
bill
of
exceptions.
