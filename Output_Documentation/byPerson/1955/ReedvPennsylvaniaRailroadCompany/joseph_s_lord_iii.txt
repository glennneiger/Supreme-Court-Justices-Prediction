mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
to
review
the
decision
of
that
court
affirming
the
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
which
dismissed
the
petitioner's
complaint
filed
in
that
court
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
question
of
coverage
was
raised
by
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
district
court
decided
it
adversely
to
the
plaintiff
and
dismissed
the
action
because
without
the
federal
jurisdiction,
there
being
no
diversity,
there
was
no
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction.
the
action
arises
out
of
an
accident
which
happened
on
july
19th,
1951.
erroneously
stated
in
our
brief
as
july
15th,
1951,
although
i
think
the
typographical
error
is
not
material.
the
accident
happened
at
the
32nd
street
office
building
of
the
respondent,
defendant
railroad
company.
that
was
in
philadelphia.
at
that
office,
and
these
facts
are
without
contradiction,
there
are
on
file
some
325,000
original
tracings
from
which
blueprints
are
made.
the
tracings
cover
and
the
blueprints
made
from
them
also
cover
every
single
part
of
the
respondent's
system,
all
of
its
mechanical
equipment,
all
of
its
cars,
all
of
its
locomotives,
its
engines,
its
bridges,
its
package.
it
covers
the
entire
system
which
extends
into
ten
different
states
and
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
the
only
place
on
the
entire
system
where
these
original
tracings
are
kept
and
it
is
the
only
on
the
entire
system
where
the
blueprints
are
made
for
the
use
in
shops
and
in
repairing
of
trucks,
bridges,
and
other
structures.
sixty
seven
percent
of
the
blueprints
that
are
made
in
the
32nd
street
office
building
or
32nd
street
office
building,
yes,
go
into
states
other
than
pennsylvania.
and
the
cars
which
they
cover,
of
course,
are
operated
over
the
respondent's
entire
10
state
and
district
of
columbia
system.
the
method
in
which
the
work
is
done
is
that
orders
come
in
from
the
various
repair
shops
which
themselves
are
located
in
various
parts
of
the
country
for
the
blueprints
that
are
needed
in
order
to
maintain,
repair
and
keep
functioning
the
respondent's
equipment
and
trackage.
the
prints
were
made,
as
i
say,
in
the
32nd
street
office
and
are
then
sent
to
the
various
repair
shops
where
the
work
of
maintenance
and
repair
is
done
or
to
the
various
locations
where
the
track
work
is
done
or
where
track
repairs
are
done.
the
plaintiff's
position
in
this
scheme
of
things
was
the
duty
of
picking
up
in
the
mornings
the
orders
as
they
came
in
from
the
various
repair
shops.
the
orders
would
call
for
a
specified
blueprint
of
a
specified
car
or
track
or
whatever
it
maybe,
and
it
was
her
duty
to
select
from
among
the
325,000
original
tracings
that
were
on
file
there,
the
proper
one
so
that
the
proper
blueprint
could
be
made
from
it.
she
would
then
take
the
--
the
original
tracing
having
selected
it
from
its
proper
place
in
the
file
and
having
made
the
proper
selection
to
the
blueprint
maker
who
would
make
from
that,
from
her
selection
the
blueprint
that
the
tracing
called
for.
she
also
had
the
correlative
and
equally
important
duty
of
replacing
in
its
proper
place
in
the
files
the
original
tracing.
i
say
an
important
duty
because
obviously,
it
was
important
that
she
get
it
back
in
the
right
place
so
that
the
next
person
looking
for
it
wouldn't
have
to
look
through
325,000
original
tracings
before
they
came
across
it.
on
these
facts,
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
in
affirming
held
that
the
--
in
effect,
that
the
petitioner's
duties
did
not
further
interstate
commerce.
as
we
see
it,
the
lower
court,
and
i'm
speaking
here
of
the
court
of
appeals,
fell
into
two
basic
and
fundamental
errors.
fundamental
errors
which
require,
it
seems
to
us,
reversal
and
fundamental
errors
which
were
allowed
to
go
uncorrected
would
emasculate
the
1939
amendment
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
first
error
into
which
the
court
fell
was
its
unstated
premise
although
nonetheless
clearly
apparent
from
its
opinion
that
the
words
interstate
commerce,
in
the
--
even
in
the
amended
act
were
equated
with
what
we
may
call
the
classical
staff
of
railroading,
the
engines,
the
breaks,
the
tracks
and
the
switches.
and
that
almost
physical
proximity,
physical
contact
with
this
stuff
of
railroading
was
required
in
order
for
an
employee
to
be
covered
by
the
act.
now
that
truncated
view,
if
you
will,
of
the
act
fails
utterly
to
give
any
significance
whatsoever
to
the
enlarging
words
of
the
1939
amendment.
and
here
it's
important,
it
seems
to
me,
to
contrast
the
words
that
were
used
in
the
1939
amendment
with
the
language
that
was
used
in
the
original
act
or
rather
the
second
act
of
1908.
i
say
second
because
as
your
honors
know,
the
first
was
unconstitutional.
the
language
of
the
act
of
1908
and
significantly
enough
continued
on
without
change
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
amended
act
of
1939
was,
that
the
carrier
was
liable
for
injuries
to
any
of
its
employees
who
were
injured
while
employed
in
such
commerce.
this
court
early
and
continuously
construed
commerce
in
that
sense
to
mean
transportation.
therefore,
under
the
1939
act
or
the
1908
act,
the
criterion
for
coverage
was
actual
employment
in
transportation.
now,
the
1939
act,
however,
went
far
beyond
that
and
as
opposed
to
employment
in
commerce,
merely
stated
as
the
touchstone
that
the
duties
shall
be
in
furtherance
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
shall,
in
anyway,
directly
or
closely
and
substantially
affect
such
commerce.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
as
your
honor
said,
i
--
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
niceness
but
i
think
the
distinction
is
of
extreme
importance.
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
a
distinct
difference
between
the
man
who
holds
the
throttle,
runs
the
engine,
puts
on
the
break,
throws
the
switch
and
a
person
who
contributes
to
that
operation.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
transportation?
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
i
think
that
congress
probably
could
not
have
regulated
it
unless
it
had,
had
its
eye
on
that
but
knowing
now
its
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
well,
sir,
i'm
not
sure
about
that
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
where
they
apparently
accepted
the
jones
and
laughlin
decision
as
controlling.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
unquestionably,
your
honor,
unquestionably.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
precisely
what
congress
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
but
precisely
what
congress
did,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
word
commerce
and
the
words
interstate
commerce
as
embodied
in
the
1939
amendment,
actually
embraced
a
different
concept
from
the
pre-1939
concept
of
interstate
commerce.
and
if
i
may
illustrate
that
mister
--
mr.
hildebrand
started
me
on
it
perhaps,
but
if
we
look
at
this
lectern
as
he
did,
as
being
transportation,
then
the
imposition
of
the
employee
on
that
and
that
i
consider
to
be
engagement
in
rather
than
mere
furtherance
of
but
engagement
in.
the
imposition
of
the
employee
on
the
concept
or
the
idea
of
transportation
that
was
the
area
and
that
was
the
periphery
of
the
area
which
congress
was
regulating
under
the
1908
act.
now
however,
the
employment
in,
in
that
sense,
in
the
actual
movement
was
abolished
by
the
1939
amendment
because
they
used
the
words
in
furtherance
of
and
that
i
conceive
to
be
something
like
this.
this
employee
furthering
this
business
of
transportation,
although
not
in
it
over
here,
but
furthering
it
from
here
and
this
employee
furthering
it
from
here
and
an
unbroken
chain
of
furthering
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
sir,
i
think
the
legislative
history
maybe
of
importance
in
that.
i
think
unquestionably,
the
legislative
history
showed
that
what
we
wanted
to
do
was
to
go
as
far
as
we
could
go.
and
that's
what
we
tried
to
do.
we
tried
to
go
as
far
as
we
could
go.
the
mere
fact
that
senator
austin
was
concerned
with
whether
or
not
they
would
go
constitutionally
too
far
is
an
indication
that
senator
austin
wanted
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
the
act.
but
even
if
he
had
used
only
the
words
furtherance,
then,
of
course,
it
seems
to
me,
that
those
--
that
--
that
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
extent,
the
broadening
of
the
scope
of
the
act.
they
did
not.
but
the
second
set
of
words,
i
think
as
nearly
as
i
can
penetrate
the
mentality
of
congress
and
that
is
difficult
i
suggest
to
your
honors
for
a
layman
such
as
myself.
they
were
words
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
but
from
a
different
viewpoint,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
who
drew
the
bill?
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
i
don't
believe,
sir,
that
the
--
there
is
anything
in
the
report
of
the
proceedings
would
show
who
actually
framed
the
bill,
at
least
not
to
my
knowledge.
but
in
any
--
at
any
rate,
there
can
be
no
doubt,
it
seems
to
me,
that
they
intended
to
go
much,
much
beyond
the
narrow
concept
that
had
been
engrafted
upon
the
1908
act.
and
this
was
something
which
the
court
of
appeals
gave
no
attention
to
whatsoever.
that
error,
i
think,
and
by
the
way
while
i'm
addressing
myself
to
that,
may
i
say
just
one
word
on
this
so-called
moment
of
injury
test.
there
seems
to
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
act
did
not
merely
do
away
with
the
moment
of
injury
test.
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
--
that
if
that
had
been
the
mere
intent
of
congress,
they
could
simply
have
added
to
sect
--
to
paragraph
1
of
the
act
of
1908
the
words
instead
of
saying,
any
person
suffering
injury
while
he
is
employed
by
such
carrier
in
such
commerce,
simply
by
amending
that
to
read,
any
person
suffering
injury,
any
part
of
whose
duties
shall
be
employment
by
such
carrier
in
such
commerce.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
phrase
in
any
part
which
does
away
with
the
so-called
moment
of
injury
rule,
and
the
phrase
“in
furtherance
of”
which
broadens
the
scope
of
the
type
of
employee
and
the
type
of
job
which
is
covered.
now,
the
second
error,
i
think,
into
--
and
this
i
think
is
fatal
into
which
the
court
of
appeals
fell
was
the
error
of
what
you
might
call
job
label
or
job
status.
that
is
attaching
some
importance
and
in
fact
almost
transcendent
importance
to
the
relative
importance
of
the
job
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
railroad
echelons
or
determining
upon
a
label,
i.e.,
clerical
worker
and
using
the
label
without
regard
to
the
job
function
and
through
the
job
function
its
impact
upon
interstate
commerce.
the
label
itself
is
of
no
importance
whatsoever
whether
ms.
reed
be
called
a
clerk
or
a
blueprint
executive
is
of
no
importance
whatsoever.
the
important
thing
is
the
analysis
of
her
functions
in
connection
with
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce.
once
you
do
that,
it
seems
to
me,
you
reach
no
conclusion
other
than
the
fact
that
her
duties
did
have
an
effect
an
immediate
effect
upon
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
i
beg
your
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
your
honor,
in
order
to
answer
that
and
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
test
which
we
urge
here,
i
would
have
to
know
more
about
the
duties,
more
about
how
her
work
does
she
view
merely
with
--
with
filing.
i
would
have
to
know
more
about
her
duties
and
how
her
duties
affected
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
proximity
and
degree
to
interstate
commerce,
yes,
sir,
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
--
but
not
to
transportation.
justice
harlan
asked
during
the
preceding
argument,
were
all
railroad
employees
covered
by
this?
categorically
sir,
my
answer
is
no.
my
answer
is
no.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
no,
sir.
may
i
say
it
--
may
i
--
it's
not
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
well,
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor,
and
i
do
this
with
all
deference
again
in
respect
to
the
niceties
and
that
is
that
we
have
to
know
exactly
what
we're
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
interstate
commerce.
now,
i
have
this
in
mind,
sir.
the
pennsylvania
railroad
employees,
a
laborer,
to
sweep
up
the
leaves
and
to
take
care
of
the
flowerbeds
at
a
station,
which
is
used
on
its
interstate
lines,
he
is
furthering
his
employer's
business
if
he's
in
the
scope
and
course
of
his
employment.
but
his
relationship
to
interstate
commerce
and
his
impact
and
effect
upon
interstate
commerce
is
nil.
that
employee
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
yes,
sir,
but
i
don't
think
that
their
mere
likes
and
dislikes
would
have
a
question
or
an
effect
upon
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
precisely,
sir,
and
that
is
the
test
which
i
am
suggesting
here,
what
i
might
call
for
one
of
a
better
word
the
withdrawal
test.
withdraw
the
duties
performed
by
this
particular
individual
and
does
interstate
commerce
suffer,
is
it
affected
or
is
it
not?
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
well,
perhaps,
again
like
senator
austin,
it's
an
over
abundance
of
caution,
i
didn't
want
to
go
too
far
and
was
trying
to
confine
myself
to
the
facts
that
we
have
here
in
the
reed
case
because
i
think
in
this
case
there
is
no
question.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
well
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
i
--
i
agree
that
you
can't
stand
on
the
proximity
test
or
on
the
word
“furtherance”
in
relation
to
the
railroad's
business,
but
you
can
i
think
stand
on
the
word
“furtherance”
in
relation
to
the
phrase
“interstate
commerce”.
the
--
take
for
example
the
facts
in
this
case.
here's
a
lady
who
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
selecting
a
proper
blueprint.
let
me
suggest
the
example
to
your
honor
of
a
bridge
upon
the
railroad's
lines,
a
drawbridge,
if
you
will.
and
the
drawbridge
is
raised
and
something
goes
wrong
with
the
lowering
mechanism
and
the
drawbridge
won't
come
down.
immediately
a
hurried
call
comes
in
to
32nd
street
station
--
32nd
street
office
building
for
a
blueprint
of
the
lowering
mechanism.
ms.
reed
misperforms
her
function
and
selects
instead
of
the
lowering
mechanism
the
raising
mechanism,
and
gives
that
to
the
blueprint
maker
who
makes
the
blueprint
and
rushes
it
up
to
the
point
where
the
repairs
are
being
made
on
the
bridge.
immediately
comes
back
a
frantic
call
that,
“you've
sent
us
the
wrong
blueprint.”
trains
are
piling
up
on
each
side
of
this
--
of
this
raised
drawbridge.
interstate
traffic
can't
move,
why?
because
ms.
reed
misperformed
her
job.
and
that
is
the
type
of
test
which
we
proposed
to
this
court.
the
type
of
test
which
will
analyze
the
job
function,
analyze
the
impact
of
that
function
upon
interstate
commerce.
and
once
that
job
function
is
analyzed
here,
the
impact
upon
interstate
commerce
is
immediate,
it's
apparent,
and
may
even
be
cataclysmic
if
the
job
is
not
performed
or
is
misperformed.
compare
that
for
a
moment
with
the
peterson
case
where
even
before
the
1939
amendment,
peterson
was
held
to
be
in
interstate
commerce
and
covered
by
the
1908
act
where
he
was
a
riveter
who
was
repairing
a
bridge.
the
person
who
hands
him
the
blueprint
to
tell
him
where
to
drive
the
rivet
is
equally
as
important
in
the
scheme
of
interstate
commerce
as
the
man
who
drives
the
rivet
himself
because
if
he
doesn't
know
where
to
drive
the
rivet,
his
job
will
cease.
the
job
that's
dependent
upon
him
just
as
in
the
assembly
line
of
the
southern
pacific
will
come
to
a
halt
because
that
job
was
not
performed.
the
court
of
appeals
started
on
the
right
track.
when
the
court
of
appeals
resorted
to
the
old
poem
of
“for
want
of
a
nail,
the
shoe
was
lost
and
for
want
of
a
shoe,
the
horse
went
lame”.
unfortunately,
the
court
stopped
short
of
the
ultimate.
they
reached
the
penultimate
but
stop
short
of
the
ultimate,
because
having
gone
that
far
and
having
recognized
that
there
is
a
chain
of
proximate
relationships
which
advanced
interstate
commerce,
which
further
interstate
commerce
in
a
very
real
sense,
they
nevertheless
stop
short
because
of
a
job
label,
namely,
that
the
lady
was
a
clerk.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
because,
sir,
if
we
--
if
we
were
to
go
the
whole
length,
then
it
would
make
meaningless
the
--
the
second
section
of
the
statute.
all
they
would
have
to
say
would
be
any
employee
of
an
interstate
carrier
by
rail.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
yes,
sir,
i
--
i
would
disagree
with
one
thing.
i
--
i
don't
think
i
could
argue
the
other
side
as
well
as
i
could
argue
mine
but
--
[laughter]
because
i'm
not
convinced
of
the
other
side.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
sir,
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
go
as
far
as
covering
every
single
railroad
employee.
i
think
that
congress
intended
to
cover
those
railroad
employees
who
furthered
interstate
commerce
in
a
very
real
sense
as
ms.
reed
does
in
a
very
real
sense,
furthered
interstate
commerce
by
the
work
that
she
performed.
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
the
what,
sir?
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
i
guess
so.
i'm
not
completely
sure
of
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
but
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
sure.
i
would
say
that
--
that
if
that
job
were
misperformed
or
not
performed,
there
would
be
an
immediate
effect
upon
interstate
commerce.
i'll
go
one
step
further
with
your
honor
mr.
justice
reed.
i'll
say
that
the
boy
who
takes
the
blueprint
to
the
mail
is
covered.
there
maybe
office
boys
who
aren't
covered,
who
simply
deliver
intradepartmental
memos
that
have
no
relationship
to
interstate
commerce
such
as
when
they're
going
to
take
their
vacations
and
a
new
rate
of
pay
or
something.
but
he
may
not
be
covered
but
not
because
he's
an
office
boy,
but
because
the
function
that
he
performs
is
--
does
not
have
a
direct
bearing
upon
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
misperformance
of
her
function
would
have
any
effect
to
interstate
commerce,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
well,
if
she
didn't
do
it?
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
if
she
didn't
do
it,
if
she
simply
connected
with
a
wrong
number
and
then
connect
it
right
back
again.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
if
your
honor
will
note,
of
course,
first
of
all,
the
two
clauses
as
judge
biggs
noted
in
his
dissent,
in
this
case,
are
in
the
disjunctive.
the
--
or
i
think
is
not
epexegetical
in
the
sense
that
it
is
explanatory
of
the
first
phrase.
i
think
the
two
mean
two
different
things.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
since
i'm
on
this
--
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
since
i'm
on
this
summary
docket,
sir,
i'm
afraid
i'm
barred
from
that.[laughter]
but
at
any
rate,
the
second
--
the
--
the
second
point
that
i
should
like
to
make
to
your
honor
is,
i
thought
of
the
--
the
squib
case,
the
--
the
but
for
rule,
and
proximate
cause.
but
here
we're
not
talking
about
cause,
sir.
we're
talking
about
effect
which
i
think
is
different
and
we're
talking
not
in
a
legal
or
philosophical
sense,
we're
talking
in
a
hard
realistic
sense.
at
least
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
do,
sir,
in
a
hard
realistic
sense
as
to
whether
or
not
the
performance
of
this
function
has
a
direct
bearing,
a
furthering
effect,
if
you
will,
upon
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
no,
sir,
i
didn't
intend
to
suggest
that
but
merely
that
here
we're
not
looking
at
--
at
causation.
we're
looking
at
the
effect
of
what
a
given
person
does
and
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
but
for
test,
if
--
if
i'm
impelled
on
that
at
the
moment,
i
didn't
intend
to
be.
but
if
i
am,
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
it's
a
good
test.
in
this
respect,
the
withdrawal
test,
withdraw
the
function
and
do
we
have
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
that
is
the
test
which
the
court
below
refused
to
apply.
the
court
below
forgot
that
it
was
not
important
that
a
private
lost
the
horseshoe
nail
or
a
general
lost
the
horseshoe
nail.
the
job
status
of
the
man
that
lost
the
nail
was
totally
unimportant.
the
important
thing
was
the
function
of
the
nail
and
the
fact
that
nail
was
lost.
and
i
say
to
your
honors,
that's
the
important
thing
in
ms.
reed's
case.
analyze
from
that
standpoint,
there
is
a
real,
a
definite
effect
upon
interstate
commerce
in
her
job
and
on
these
facts.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honor
that
she
fulfills
both
ends
of
the
statute,
that
her
work
furthers
interstate
commerce
and
affects
it
directly
or
closely
and
substantially.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
only
in
the
sense,
sir,
that
--
well
the
--
the
report,
i
may
say,
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
this
morning
dealt
with
the
so-called
abolition
of
the
--
of
the
so-called
moment
of
injury
or
pinpoint
test.
it
did.
but
that
was
not
restricted
and
the
statute
itself
did
much
more
than
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
lord,
iii
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
if
you
just
look
at
the
--
at
the
report,
you
had
also
looked
well
at
what
senator
austin
said
showing
a
very
definite
knowledge
that
they
were
not
only
abolishing
the
moment
of
injury
test
but
were
completely
broadening
the
periphery
of
the
job
functions
that
were
embraced
in
the
act
itself.
