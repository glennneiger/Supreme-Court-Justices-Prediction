mr.
theodore
voorhees
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
preliminary
to
a
typographical
error
on
page
43
of
my
brief.
in
footnote
66,
exactly
halfway
down
southern
pacific
railroad
versus
industrial
accident
commission,

california
appeals
that
should
be
second
by
mistake
the

left
out.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
it's
footnote
66
halfway
down,
the
southern
pacific
versus
industrial
accident,
that
should
be
second.
now
if
your
honors
please,
to
narrow
the
issue
here
a
little
bit,
all
the
counsel
that
have
argued
this
morning,
i
think,
would
agree
that
the
main
purpose
or
certainly
a
purpose
of
the
1939
amendment
was
to
abolish
the
moment
of
injury
rule.
and
the
issue,
it
seems
to
me
is,
did
it
enlarge
coverage
beyond
bringing
in
those
employees
who
were
formally
barred
by
that
rule
or
did
it
do
--
did
it
--
did
it
enlarge
it
or
did
it
do
nothing
more
than
abolish
that
rule.
now,
the
petitioner
concedes
in
this
case,
concedes
that
all
employees
are
not
covered.
i
think
counsel
is
impelled
to
make
that
admission
because
it
would
have
been
so
very
easy
for
congress
to
have
written
this
act
in
terms
that
would
have
covered
all
employees
had
it
had
any
intention
to
do
so.
two
years
before
in
the
railroad
at
the
time
enacted
had
done
exactly
that,
the
year
before
in
the
railroad
and
employment
insurance
act
had
had
also
brought
in
all
employees.
there's
no
question
whatever
despite
the
howard
case
decision
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
1939,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
entire
railroad
industry
was
subject
to
regulation
certainly
insofar
as
supply
relationship
were
concerned
if
it
is
so
intended.
we
concede
of
course
that
the
result
of
this
amendment
was
enormously
to
broaden
the
coverage
of
the
act
because
after
the
1939
amendment,
all
transportation
employees
whether
they
were
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce
or
interstate
commerce
for
all
intents
and
purposes
were
brought
within
the
scope
of
the
act
the
minute
the
moment
of
entry
will
--
was
abolished.
of
course,
it
had
a
very
broad
effect
on
--
on
shop
employees
also
soon
as
a
--
an
engine,
any
instrumentality
of
transportation
was
being
repaired.
the
mere
fact
that
at
the
very
moment
of
the
man's
injury,
that
he
was
working
on
a
dead
locomotive,
no
longer
was
he
barred,
he
was
recovered.
now,
counsel
have
made
a
very
fleeting
reference
to
the
first
paragraph
of
the
first
section
of
the
act,
which
is
in
the
1939
amendment.
in
other
words,
section
1
of
the
act
is
composed
of
two
paragraphs
of
which
the
first
paragraph
was
in
the
1908
act.
and
that
the
reenactment
of
that
section
carried
with
it,
of
course,
the
gloss
of
this
court's
construction.
and
when
mr.
hildebrand
this
morning
said
that
all
the
cases
that
were
decided
before
1939
should
be
cast
into
limbo,
he
utterly
ignores
the
principle
that
when
this
--
when
this
court
interprets
a
--
a
paragraph
such
as
the
first
paragraph
of
this
section
has
been
reenacted
that
you
can't
just
throw
into
limbo
all
the
cases
cited
by
this
court
under
that
section
before.
they
are
part
of
the
warp
and
woof
and
they're
still
before
us.
so
that
in
attempting
to
find
the
meaning
of
the
1939
amendment,
we
have
to
start
not
with
the
second
paragraph,
and
start
worrying
about
furtherance,
but
we
have
to
start
with
the
reenacted
paragraph
1
and
see
what
this
court
had
said
that
meant
prior
to
1939
because
since
congress
reenacted
that
paragraph,
there's
an
inference
at
least
that
--
that
everything
that
had
been
said
about
it
before
still
stood.
now,
there
were
several
points
of
great
importance
with
reference
to
that
first
paragraph
which
were
briefly
mentioned
this
morning
but
i
want
to
repeat
them.
in
the
first
place,
in
the
shanks
case,
your
honor
said
that
commerce
meant
transportation.
and
again
and
again
and
again,
this
court
went
back
to
the
shanks
case
until
finally
in
1932
in
the
ball
case,
the
court
said,
"when
we
define
commerce
to
mean
transportation,
we
wrote
a
role
which
have
adhered
to
in
every
case
since
except
in
one
or
two
cases
where
inadvertently,
we
overlooked
it
and
those
cases
were
subsequently
overruled."
therefore,
we
start
off
with
interstate
commerce
meaning
interstate
transportation
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
meaning
must
carry
over
into
the
second
paragraph,
just
as
it
must
be
applied
to
the
first
paragraph
tined
with
the
loss
of
interpretation.
now,
in
the
second
place,
and
i
think
this
is
equally
important,
the
1908
act
was
not
interpreted
by
this
court
as
applied
only
to
employees
in
transportation.
that
is
only
to
the
cruise
of
trains,
because
in
a
series
of
decisions,
the
court
parted
at
1939
had
interpreted
the
act
as
being
broad
enough
to
include
in
addition
to
the
train
cruise
and
those
directly
engaged
in
transportation.
it
said
that
those
whose
duties
directly
affected
transportation
were
likewise
within
the
act.
and
finally
in
a
series
of
cases
it
said,
those
whose
duties
so
closely
affected
transportation
as
to
be
in
legal
contemplation
and
practical
effect
apart
of
that
transportation
that
they
also
are
brought
in.
so
that
by
1939,
there
were
three
groups
of
employees
or
three
broad
categories
of
employees
who
were
concededly
within
the
terms
of
the
act.
now
they
were
first
the
transportation
employees
themselves.
the
engine
man,
fireman,
conductors,
break
man.
secondly,
those
whose
duties
directly
affected
transportation.
and
within
that
category
were
the
yardman,
certain
station
employees,
a
switchman,
all
the
people
who
were
on
the
ground
but
who
by
their
duties
cause
transportation
to
move
in
one
direction
or
another.
and
then
thirdly,
there
was
a
group
who
came
within
whose
duties
brought
them
closely
in
the
contact
with
transportation.
and
they
also
were
permitted
to
recover
and
within
that
category
were
those
who
maintain
the
right
of
way,
those
who
repaired
the
instrumentalities
of
transportation,
possibly
others.
two
great
defenses
that
were
brought
forth
again
and
again
by
the
railroads
blocked
the
congressional
purpose
in
providing
a
strong
remedy
for
those
employees
who
faced
the
great
hazards
of
the
railroad
industry.
this
court
said
that
the
employee
had
to
be
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
at
the
very
moment
of
injury
and
this
court
said
that
assumption
of
risk
barred
recovery.
and
between
the
horns
of
those
two,
two
horns
of
that
dilemma,
case
after
case
resulted
in
a
denial
of
recovery
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
if
your
honors
will
review
the
whole
legislative
history
of
this
case,
there's
no
question
that
in
1939,
congress
was
concerned
with
those
two
things
and
those
two
things
alone.
there
is
word
--
a
word
here
and
there
in
which
they
deal
with
the
constitutional
issue
and
they
put
in
the
words
closely
and
substantially
and
so
on.
but
the
whole
drive
of
congress
was
aimed
at
polishing
the
moment
of
injury
rule
in
its
dual
aspects
of
the
man
who's
in
intrastate
commerce
at
the
very
moment
or
the
instrumentality
that
was
taken
out
of
interstate
and
at
dead
locomotive
at
the
moment
and
the
abolition
of
the
assumption
of
risk
doctrine.
congress
had
to
put
in
the
language
the
question
--
the
broadened
coverage
which
it
was
supplying
when
it
abolished
the
moment
of
injury
rule.
of
course,
the
assumption
of
risk,
that
was
taken
care
of
in
a
different
section.
but
in
section
1
of
this
amendment,
they
were
only
dealing
with
the
moment
of
injury
rule.
now,
i'll
ask
your
honors
to
turn
to
the
language
of
the
act
on
page
7
of
my
brief,
the
second
paragraph.
the
keywords
in
the
first
place
are
any
part
of
those
duties
and
the
furtherance
clause,
they
directly,
closely
and
substantially
clauses,
the
--
the
subject
to
those
clauses
in
each
case
is
any
part
of
whose
duties
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
those
words
were
aimed
only
at
getting
rid
of
the
moment
of
entry
rule.
the
clause
dealing
with
furtherance,
i
submit,
was
clearly
intended
to
take
care
of
the
employees
who
were
actually
in
transportation
and
that
it
did
not
have
any
broad
sweep
such
as
has
been
suggested
here
today
by
other
counsel
in
this
case.
furtherance
was
used
in
the
sense
of
motion,
the
moving
transportation.
your
honors
must
remember
that
we're
referring
here
to
furtherance
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
by
the
language
but
for
commerce,
you
must
substitute
transportation
since
that
was
part
of
warp
and
woof
of
the
reenactment
of
the
first
paragraph.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
well
because
--
because
your
honor,
this
court
had
said
again
and
again
in
--
that
in
paragraph
one,
that
for
commerce
you
must
read
transportation
and
when
congress
reenacted
that
paragraph
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
congress
had
in
mind
continuing
the
basic
purpose
of
this
act
which
dealt
with
transportation
employees,
otherwise,
they
would
have
said
by
congress,
we
mean
interstate
commerce
in
all
its
aspects
as
they
did
and
all
the
other
contemporary
legislation
that
was
enacted
during
this
period.
i
don't
think
you
can
--
you
can
start
off
and
say
that
the
first
paragraph,
although
it's
reenacted,
now
means
something
entirely
different
from
what
it
meant
under
all
our
decisions.
when
we
said
over
and
over
again,
that
commerce
meant
transportation,
simply
because
a
new
paragraph
was
added
and
if
your
honors
again
will
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you'll
see
that
--
that
in
the
report
they
cited
that
fact
that
this
court
have
ruled
that
commerce
meant
transportation.
and
there's
no
suggestion
whatever
that
they
meant
to
change
that
--
that
basic
principle.
now
--
mr.
theodore
voorhees
yes,
sir,
i
shall.
i
shall.
furtherance
had
been
used
in
a
number
of
earlier
cases
including
one
in
this
court
and
had
it
been
used
in
roberts
and
various
other
places
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief
as
meaning
motion,
promotion
movement
of
transportation,
and
we
interpret
the
furtherance
clause
as
applying
the
abolition
of
the
moment
of
entry
rule
insofar
as
it
applied
to
the
cruise
of
the
trains,
those
who
were
actually
engaged
in
transportation.
then
the
directly
clause
or
that
the
directly
phrase
was
intended
to
abolish
the
moment
of
entry
rule
as
it
was
applied
to
those
who
were
not
in
transportation
but
whose
duties
had
directly
affected
them,
in
other
words,
the
--
the
yardman
and
switchman
and
so
on.
and
then
they
closely
and
substantially
phrase
again
the
predicate
of
the
subject
any
part
of
whose
duties
again
is
simply
a
clause
intended
to
abolish
the
moment
of
entry
rule
insofar
as
it
was
applied
to
repairman
and
maintenance
man.
now,
that
construction
of
the
amendment
is
fully
borne
out
by
the
legislative
history,
and
i
--
i'd
like
to
come
immediately
to
--
to
justice
harlan's
point.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to,
with
your
honors'
indulgence,
to
read
to
you
the
two
paragraphs
on
page
22
of
my
brief
which
was
the
entire
report
of
the
conferees
after
the
--
the
bill
had
been
passed
by
both
the
house
and
the
senate.
the
conferees
agreed
to
a
senate
provision
not
contained
in
the
house
amendment,
which
is
intended
to
broaden
the
scope
of
the
employers'
liability
act
so
as
to
include
within
the
provisions
employees
of
common
carriers
who,
while
ordinarily
engaged
in
the
transportation
of
interstate
commerce,
maybe
at
the
time
of
the
injury
temporarily
divorce
there
from
and
engage
in
intrastate
operations.
the
question
whether
an
employee
at
the
time
of
this
injury
is
engaged
in
interstate
or
intrastate
commerce
is
frequently
difficult
of
determination
under
the
rule
laid
down
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
an
employee
of
the
railroad
company
who
maybe
injured
must
be
found
to
have
been
engaged
at
the
time
of
the
infliction
of
the
injury
“in
transportation
or
work
so
closely
related
to
it
as
to
be
a
practically
a
part
of
it.”
now,
senator
austin
was
the
person
who
was
responsible
for
limiting
rather
than
broadening
the
language
of
the
amendment.
in
addition
to
the
--
the
--
being
responsible
for
putting
in
the
so
closely
--
closely
and
substantially
clause,
he
also
was
responsible
for
knocking
out
a
clause
or
a
phrase
that
was
interpolated
within
the
amendment
as
recently
drawn
which
provided
in
any
degree
incidental
to.
and
he
said
that
he
saw
that
was
too
broad
and
--
and
have
it
knocked
out
and
put
in
the
closely
and
substantially
instead.
now,
i
think
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
from
all
the
background
of
the
discussions,
the
fact
that
mr.
mcgrath
who
was
the
proponent
of
this
act
himself
testified
that
this
would
only
that
the
--
the
amendment
would
only
apply
to
the
same
employees
to
whom
the
act
had
applied
beforehand,
i.e.,
and
he
listed
with
the
trainmen
and
so
on.
and
all
the
other
discussion
that
--
that
the
--
the
amendment
was
only
to
have
a
limited
effect,
i
think
when
they
came
to
putting
in
this
language
and
referring
to
the
words
of
this
court
in
its
interpretation
of
the
extent
of
the
commerce
power,
commerce,
i
think
that
senator
austin
was
simply
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
wanted
to
be
sure
that
nothing
that
they
put
into
this
amendment
might
be
interpreted
by
this
court
as
still
too
broad.
and
therefore,
that
he
put
in
the
closely
and
substantially
and
directly
affecting
knowing
that
this
court
had
recently
said
well,
were
something
directly
or
closely
and
substantially
affects
commerce,
why
then
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
it.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
exactly.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
voorhees
exactly.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
exactly,
sir.
and
the
mere
fact
that
this
amendment
was
broad
enough
so
that
it
was
going
out
to
spill
over
and
take
out
people
that
were
injured
in
intrastate
commerce,
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
--
that
the
intent
of
congress
and
to
the
exercise
of
its
power
would
still
be
within
proper
limits,
but
he
certainly
was
not
indicating
that
--
that
congress
was
trying
to
reach
out
and
bring
in
people
who
--
who
occupied
any
type
of
position
or
--
or
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
have
any
relationships
of
transportation.
i
think
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
--
at
the
legislative
history
closely,
you'll
see
that
congress
was
only
concerned
with
transportation,
the
transportation
industry.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
certainly
not.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
yes,
sir,
it
is.
but
--
but
i
--
i
set
forth
in
my
brief
and
--
and
the
time
being
short
i
don't
want
to
labor
it
but
during
the
--
during
--
this
was
a
period
of
great
transition
in
the
interpretation
of
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
and
--
and
congress
had
learned
by
1939
how
to
draw
an
act
that
would
receive
the
approval
of
this
court.
and
it
did
it
by
defining
commerce
and
defining
affecting
commerce,
it
did
it
by
a
statement
of
policy
at
the
beginning
and
it
--
or
it
did
it
by
simply
stating
flatfootedly
as
it
did
in
the
railroad
retirement
act
that
every
employee
was
intended
to
be
brought
under
it
and
they
knew
it
would
be
all
right.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
no,
sir,
--
mr.
theodore
voorhees
is
not
here.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
no,
sir.
and
as
--
mr.
theodore
voorhees
plus
--
plus
the
fact
that
there's
not
one
word
of
indication
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
act
itself
that
congress
intended
to
go
away
outside
of
what
it
has
regulated
before
and
bring
in
all
these
additional
employees.
now,
i
--
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
theodore
voorhees
transportation.
mr.
theodore
voorhees
i
say
this,
sir.
that
in
1908
--
1906
but
particularly
in
1908,
congress
wanted
to
provide
an
act
which
would
give
a
real
remedy
for
those
who
faced
the
hazards
of
the
transportation
industry,
the
railroad
employees
who
were
maimed
and
hurt
because
of
the
danger
of
working
around
the
instrumentalities
of
transportation.
following
the
passage
of
that
act,
this
court
did
not
say
that
we'll
only
grant
recovery
to
those
who
faced
those
hazards.
it
couldn't
say
that
because
it
was
too
conscious
of
the
fact
that
there
were
many,
many
employees
who
faced
those
hazards,
who
received
severe
injuries
and
yet
who
couldn't
recover
because
they
went
within
the
act.
nonetheless,
in
all
the
decisions
prior
to
1939,
recovery
was
in
fact
limited
to
those
who
did
face
the
hazards
of
the
transportation
industry.
file
clerks
did
not
recover.
people
who
were
engaged
in
manufacturing,
people
who
were
engaged
in
new
construction
did
not
recover.
it
was
the
railroad
people
who
run
the
trains,
who
were
near
the
tracks,
who
were
switching
and
so
on.
they
were
the
ones
who
recovered.
in
1939,
congress
attempted
to
bring
all
employees
who
faced
the
hazards
of
the
transportation
industry
within
this
act.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
the
test,
it
was
the
test
prior
to
1939
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
moment
of
injury
rule.
after
1939,
all
transportation
employees
are
brought
within
the
act
because
all
of
them
affect
interstate
transportation
everytime
you
--
you
work
along
the
--
the
tracks
why
you're
going
affect
it
one
way
or
another.
but
the
employees
who
worked
in
an
office
building,
the
employees
who
were
engaged
in
manufacture,
the
employees
who
were
engaged
in
new
construction,
away
from
the
tracks,
away
from
the
hazards
of
the
railroad
industry,
those
are
people
who
should
be
left
to
the
remedies
of
the
state
law.
there's
no
reason
to
bring
them
within
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
they
went
within
the
ambit
of
it.
they
weren't
contemplated.
first,
originally
because
congress
saw
they
didn't
have
the
power
to
bring
them
in
perhaps
but
later
on
when
it
knew
it
had
--
did
have
the
power
to
bring
them
in,
it
didn't
do
it.
therefore,
i
submit
that
ms.
reed
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
other
cases
which
your
honor
heard
this
morning
ought
to
be
relegated
to
the
proper
remedy.
and
that
your
honor
should
not
enlarge
the
coverage
of
this
act
which
your
honors
have
characterized
as
cruel
as
(inaudible)
and
as
unsatisfactory
in
many
ways.
if
the
--
the
coverage
should
not
be
expanded
unless
congress
itself
expands
this.
it's
much
better
for
congress
to
reexamine
the
whole
thing
and
write
a
conversation
on
it.
there's
a
proper
remedy
for
all
the
employees
in
the
railroad
industry.
