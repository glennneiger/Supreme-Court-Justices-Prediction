justice

mr.
lord,
it
maybe
merely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
matter
of
language,
even
the
second
paragraph
under
which
congress
didn't
reject
as
in
employed
in
but
at
the
time
what
constituted
an
employer.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
second
paragraph
is
doing
this.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
wasn't
meant
to
do
something.
i'm
not
suggesting
the
situation
wasn't
a
disheveled
situation.
i
merely
we
suggest
that
congress
still
had
its
eye
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
employed
in
such
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
it
accepted
the
--
they
accept
it
as
to
how
that
decision
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
they
couldn't
make
it
(inaudible)
based
on
these
stages
in
which
it
covers
transactions,
(inaudible)
or
activities
by
the
employee
for
an
interstate
carrier
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
convention
of
his
--
with
activities
in
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
--
this
doesn't
offer
difficulties
disclosed
in
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
could
have
(inaudible)
having
no
persuasiveness
at
least
with
me,
that
congress
can
only
use
the
first
clause
and
stop
there,
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
in
the
same
boat.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
are
in
the
same
lead
insofar
is
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
there
is
a
problem
with
proximity
and
degree
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
do
--
cannot
construe
furtherance
as
just
furthering
because
cutting
out
intrastate
commerce,
all
the
employees
of
the
pennsylvania
(inaudible)
exclusively
relating
to
interstate
grand
petition
by
the
(inaudible),
how
furthering
in
interstate
commerce?
i'm
assuming
you're
all
pertaining
to
their
job,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
secretary
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
wouldn't
be
but
--
but
those
who
are
concerned
with
pennsylvania
interstate
district
are
there
before
the
--
are
there
before
and
presumably
the
pennsylvania
made
a
judgment
that
they
required
to
(inaudible)
a
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
about
that.
i
don't
know
about
that
than
it
is
--
pennsylvania
(inaudible)
in
the
local
stations,
now
that
has
some
effect
on
whether
you
go
(inaudible)
pennsylvania
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
just
to
inquire
whether
without
that
particular
functionary,
the
pennsylvania
couldn't
conduct
their
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
you
difficulty
in
answering
justice
harlan's
question.
i
can't
imagine
that
the
president
of
pennsylvania
could
carry
on
without
having
a
secretary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
merely
suggest
that
you
cannot
stand
on
the
mere
english
of
the
phrase
“furtherance
of”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
go
beyond
where
you
want
to
go,
and
once
you
say
that
then
we
get
back
to
the
old
difficulties
of
where
to
draw
the
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
proximity
and
degree
express
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
telephone
girl
who
takes
the
call
and
connects
with
ms.
reed
so
that
she
may
perform
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
certainly
be
if
they
couldn't
get
to
ms.
reed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
the
--
is
--
to
the
analogous
situation
of
the
law
and
the
causation,
the
message,
all
arising
under
and
it
is
the
same
as
the
(inaudible)
case,
but
to
the
rising
under
the
federal
act,
namely,
we're
not
talking
here
about
the
ultimate
reach
and
causal
connection
philosophically
considered.
we're
talking
of
the
sensible
way
what
is
causal
relation
which
function
right
into
the
second
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
day
we
had
long
argument
of
what
it
all
means,
mr.
lord.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
a
very
interesting
suggestion
although
that
they're
effected
by
cause
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
voorhees,
this
(inaudible)
difficult,
not
trying
to
be
--
trying
to
be
clear
about
something
(inaudible)
very
clear,
namely,
what
senator
austin
was
worried
about,
he
was
worried
about
the
scope
that
he
gives
affecting
commerce
in
relation
to
intrastate
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
drew
on
the
chief
justice,
purely
the
thing
is
--
is
associated
with
(inaudible)
labor
cases
to
indicate
that
congress
had
the
power
to
cover
even
intrastate
conduct
if
and
when
that
is
so
closely
related,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
he
was
dealing
with
the
supreme
court's
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thing
which
is
--
in
separation
or
an
isolation
of
intrastate
activity
and
yet
because
of
their
interrelationship
are
swept
under
the
commerce
clause,
that's
what
he
was
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
and
one
other
thing
because
the
national
labor
relations
act
contrary
to
what
they've
stated
earlier
did
not
contain
this
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
merely
use
the
phrase
affecting
commerce
act
in
making
it
apply
to
intrastate
transaction.
the
chief
justice
(inaudible)
for
the
court
drew
on
the
three
port
doctrine
of
the
interrelated
intrastate-interstate
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
the
problem
with
that
phrase,
this
isn't
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
both
of
which
is
unexquisitely
and
i
take
it,
you
would
exquisitely
say
the
question
of
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
not
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
(inaudible)
