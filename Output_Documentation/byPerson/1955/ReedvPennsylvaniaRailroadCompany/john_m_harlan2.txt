how
would
you
classify

justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
you
classify
the
president's
stenographer
under
your
view
of
the
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
you
hesitate
to
go
the
whole
length
of
your
argument?
you
say
that
the
effect
of
the
1939
amendment
is
to
bring
in
all
railroad
employees.
why
do
you
hesitate
to
go
that
far?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
you
can
argue
neither
end
as
far
as
the
grammar
of
the
statute
is
concerned,
you
can
argue
of
the
other
side
as
well
as
you
can
argue
yours,
don't
you
have
perfectly
underlying
--
of
the
underlying
purpose
of
all
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
thing
i
hope
you'll
deal
with
before
you
sit
down,
that
is
to
send
the
rest
of
the
statement.
