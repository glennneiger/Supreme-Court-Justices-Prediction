justice

mr.
murrish,
if
you
stated
it,
i
didn't
quite
get
it,
why
after
this
was
all
settled
to
proceed
the
way
they
did
and
an
opportunity
was
afforded,
the
defendant
asked
to
submit
interrogatories.
if
he
could
do
it
in
los
angeles,
why
he
didn't
do
it?
justice
harold
burton
mr.
murrish,
just
before
you
began
this
discussion,
the
objections
of
the
deposition,
you
were
giving
illustrations
of
lack
of
due
process
in
cases
such
as
mob
control
of
the
proceedings
or
use
of
--
known
uses
of
false
testimony.
justice
harold
burton
so,
in
all
of
those
cases
that
you
gave,
there
was
something
that
attacked
the
validity
directly
of
what
was
done.
now,
in
this
case,
is
there
anything
that
raised
any
question
or
thrown
any
doubt
upon
the
truth
of
the
testimony
that
was
given
here?
is
there
any
question
raised
as
to
it
or
shown
as
to
his
lack
of
reliability?
justice
harold
burton
no.
but
you
do
have
the
coercion
of
the
mob.
you
have
no
coercion,
you
have
no
false
testimony,
you
have
nothing
that
attacks
directly
or
indirectly
the
truth
of
this
testimony,
do
you?
justice
harold
burton
that's
not
the
same
degree
of
lack
of
due
process
as
if
though
something
had
been
raised
against
but
was
done,
because
in
your
instances
that
you
gave,
it
knockout
whatever
the
case
was
--
was
against
him.
here,
there's
nothing
that
knocked
that
out.
you
just
questioned.
justice
harold
burton
might
--
justice
harold
burton
that
is
it
might
possibly
be
shown.
it's
not
that
anything
was
down
there.
justice
harold
burton
your
fundamental
position
is
that
it's
indispensable
to
due
process
that
there'd
be
confrontation
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
justice
harold
burton
let's
just
say
that
the
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
and
the
constitution
specifically
speaks
of
confrontation
in
a
criminal
case,
but
you
think
we
should
be
still
from
due
process
the
broader
rule
in
his
expressing,
given
in
the
kinds
of
expressing
that
they
laid
down
in
the
constitution.
justice
harold
burton
when
in
a
case
like
this
that
investigation
was
to
be
made
in
china
as
to
the
dissent
of
people,
the
deportee
or
let
--
of
course
will
be
deported
without
a
decent
case.
justice
harold
burton
can
you
refer
--
justice
harold
burton
ms.
--
ms.
rosenberg,
can
you
refer
us
to
the
testimony
of
that
fourth
witness
that
is
so
convincing
with
results
set
the
record?
justice
harold
burton
can
i
ask
one
question
mr.
murrish?
if
there
had
been
no
depositions
taken
in
hawaii,
is
it
your
position
that
your
client
has
the
right
to
demand
or
the
federal
government
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
transportation
for
him
and
his
counsel
to
go
there
and
take
their
position
with
--
with
the
witnesses?
justice
harold
burton
you
would
just
forego
--
justice
harold
burton
if
you
forego
them,
there
were
no
depositions
taken
there
but
he
has
a
right
to
go
there
in
their
absence.
