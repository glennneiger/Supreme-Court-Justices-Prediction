ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
never
a
very
happy
situation
where
a
defendant
is
one
implied
and
the
event
which
the
subject
matter
was
at
due
and
most
of
the
witnesses
are
2500
miles
away.
that's
the
situation
which
calls
for
some
kind
of
accommodation.
and
throughout
our
history,
there
has
been
one
method
of
accommodation
for
criminal
cases
and
one
for
every
kind
of
case
that's
short
of
criminal.
and
that
includes
some
very
important
right,
the
one
who
denied
deportation
is
a
serious
remedy
so
as
denaturalization.
there
were
many
other
rights
involved
in
civil
suit
and
yet,
we
have
to
deal
with
those
within
the
framework
of
the
civil
rules
rather
than
with
the
rules
applying
to
criminal
case.
and
i
take
it
that
the
question
here
is
whether
what
is
the
normal
usual
method
of
dealing
with
the
testimony
of
distant
witnesses
and
everything
short
of
a
criminal
case
in
the
most
fixing
for
that
term
is
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
the
court
hasn't
gone
any
further
than
that
unconscionable,
and
that's
the
problem
we
have
to
decide.
now,
it
--
one
simply
can't
say,
“well,
deportation
is
very
serious,
in
fact,
very
serious
rights
and
therefore,
that
it
apply
the
criminal
rule.
it
isn't
quite
that
simple.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
a
civil
litigation
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
i'm
not
relying
on
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
i
think
so,
except
that,
i
think
what
we
come
down
to
is
this.
is
this
procedure
unconscionable?
and
i
know
now
that
we
help
it
by
calling
it
civil
or
criminal
except
to
this
extent
that
this
court
had
said
that
the
right
of
confrontation
which
is
conferred
by
a
separate
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
as
such
to
bring
outside
of
due
process
that
applies
only
to
cases
which
are
criminal
in
the
narrowest
sense
of
that
term,
and
to
that
extent,
a
deportee
can
gain
no
comfort
from
the
sixth
amendment.
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
due
process
of
fairness
in
the
light
of
the
general
standards
of
procedure
of
our
time.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
denaturalization
is
ad
litem
as
serious
in
no
point
to
trying
to
waive
these
things,
but
that
clearly
comes
within
the
actual
framework
of
the
civil
rules
and
has
to
be
handled
that
way.
and
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
impossible
to
apply
in
so
many
things
with
exactitude,
the
criminal
rule
even
if
it
was
decided,
because
our
procedure
isn't
geared
that
way.
in
the
criminal
--
under
rule
17
(b)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
the
process
of
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
runs
throughout
the
united
states.
that's
not
true
in
civil
cases
and
it's
not
true
in
relation
to
this
problem,
because
while
the
administrator,
even
administrator,
the
agency
has
subpoena
power.
it
can
enforce
its
subpoena
power
only
with
relation
to
--
it
has
to
go
to
the
court
to
enforce
it
and
i'm
--
the
court
wouldn't
have
authority
to
order
a
witness
in
hawaii
to
come
to
los
angeles.
so
that
in
that
sense,
there's
a
real
difference
in
the
power
that's
involved.
now,
before
i
turn
to
the
questions
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
know
of
none,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
know
of
none.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
you
see
in
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
well,
it
isn't
explicit
as
it
is
in
the
regular
criminal
case
or
regular
civil
case.
because
in
a
criminal
case,
it's
clear
there
is
a
power.
in
a
civil
case,
it's
clear
there's
none.
now,
you
have
to
get
an
imprint
in
the
sense
that
the
immigration
service
can't
impose
its
subpoena
only
to
the
court.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
but
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
in
relation
to
the
particular
problem
here,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
because
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
right.
as
i
say,
i'm
not
relying
on
the
profit,
on
the
--on
the
fact
that
this
is
technically
one
or
the
other.
it
is
that
in
the
light
of
the
general
procedure
under
which
we
operate
and
in
the
light
of
what
is
in
a
sense
available,
this
is
a
problem
of
accommodation
and
the
question
here
i
--
as
i
take
it
is
not
even
whether
this
is
the
very
best
possible
procedure
that
somebody
might
have
thought
of.
the
question
is,
is
this
procedure
so
unconscionable
that
it
can
be
said
to
violate
due
process?
now,
in
that
connection
let
me
clear
up
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
in
my
view,
i
don't
think
the
general
questions
post
by
--
can't
go
are
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
destroy
anything
further
than
whether
on
this
record,
the
proceedings
that
were
had
here
were
unconscionable.
and
it's
my
endeavor
to
show
that
they
were
not.
but
let
me
clarify
before
going
into
this
particular
record,
a
matter
which
has
come
up
which
we
brought
up
out
of
the
record
in
carlson
against
landon.
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
in
cases
that's
been
in
candid
to
the
court
in
--
in
case
there's
been
misapprehension.
this
was
a
prior
hearing
under
another
warrant
which
was
ultimately
dropped
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
sung
case
that
administrative
officers
have
to
be
appointed
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
then,
after
the
--
the
writer
eliminated
that
rule,
the
humans
were
commenced
under
the
1950
act
and
just
started
all
over
again.
at
that
point,
the
government
didn't
move
to
transfer
these
hearings
to
hawaii
and
that
was
vigorously
opposed
by
counsel.
that
shows
up
from
the
carlson
record.
it
was
not
clear
from
that
record
whether
he
was
in
custody
at
that
time
or
not.
i
have
checked
that
he
was
not.
now,
the
extent
that
that
may
make
a
difference,
i
don't
know
what
would
have
happened
if
he
was
in
custody.
the
point
is
that
that
was
the
background
to
this
hearing.
there
had
been
vigorous
opposition
to
transferring
the
case
to
hawaii
and
in
this
hearing,
neither
side
approved
to
transfer.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
there
isn't
--
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
fixes
a
local.
as
matter
of
practice,
it
has
always
been
brought
where
he
is.
if
he
is
in
jail,
they
bring
it
there,
and
if
he's
out,
they
bring
it
in
a
district,
his
residence.
there
have
been
instances
wherefore
a
particular
reason,
people
have
asked
that
it
be
transferred.
this
was
done
in
the
case
of
the
late
mr.
rubinstein
which
is
sometime
--
he
asked
to
be
transferred
to
the
west
coast.
it
was
done.
now,
i
don't
have
any
figures
as
to
whether
it
is
always
done
or
but
it
--
it
has
been
done
and
it
can
be
done
because
there
was
nothing
that
fixes
it
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
about
what
it
is.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
was
the
government's
motion
at
that
point.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
can't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
it's
a
different
--
the
counsel
for
petitioner
was
to
say,
there
was
a
different
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
examining
officer
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
in
a
different
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
said
counsel
for
petitioner
was
it
to
say
in
the
earlier
hearing
and
at
this
hearing.
the
representative
of
the
government
was
different,
so
i
don't
know
whether
they
--
presumably
had
the
earlier
apply
that
is
the
examining
officer.
i
don't
believe
the
hearing
officer
would
even
have
had
to
file,
though
i
don't
know
that
he
was
aware
if
it
or
not.
the
point
is
neither
side
made
the
motion
on
their
field.
i
don't
know
whether
they
employed
some
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
this
was
--
this
had
been
discontinued
after
the
sung
case
and
if
--
the
prior
hearing
because
they
were
considered
under
that
decision
to
be
invalid.
and
therefore,
this
was
started
over
again
as
a
new
hearing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
with
the
prior
hearing
that
the
government
can
move
this
in.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
in
this
--
and
then
there
was
--
they
were
canceled
then
there
was
new
warrant
of
arrest
under
the
1950
act.
that
was
--
it
was
at
that
point
that
hyun
was
taken
into
custody
under
the
1950
act,
the
question
that
was
before
this
court
in
carlson
against
landon.
the
assault,
whether
the
1950
act
conferred
authority
to
take
him
into
custody
pending
the
hearing
on
deportation
and
it
was
under
this
hearing
and
this
warrant
that
he
was
taken
into
custody.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
in
the
1970
act.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
after
--
the
hearings
were
discontinued
at
this
point
and
then
shortly,
when
it
was
six
months
or
something
of
that
sort
after
to
some
decision,
congress
passed
a
writing
to
the
immigration
act
which
nullified
in
effect
--
effect
to
the
sung
decision
as
to
the
qualification
of
the
hearing
officer.
by
that
time
also,
the
1950
act
had
passed
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
a
new
warrant
was
issued.
i
think
the
date
was
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
it's
october
31st,
1950,
the
warrant
was
served.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
exact
date?
i
don't
have
the
exact
date
here
but
it
was
in
connection
with
those
1949
hearing.
the
--
i
don't
--
as
i
say
it
was,
the
hearings
had
proceeded,
and
it
was,
i
think,
it's
the
second
hearing
of
that
sort
there
that
it
was
enacted.
but
the
--
and
there
was
protest
and
i
think
they
had
agreed
not
to
do
it,
but
then
at
this
point,
the
whole
thing
became
moot
because
of
the
sung
decision.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
presume
that
he
was
there,
yes.
the
--
the
general
practice
is
to
simply
have
a
hearing
where
the
alien
is.
now,
if
--
if
the
hearing
had
been
transferred
to
hawaii
and
had
been
there,
i
presume
and
since
everybody
knew
that
that's
where
the
witnesses
were,
i
had
no
doubt
that
they
would
dare,
then
have
taken
him
into
custody
in
hawaii,
but
it
just
never
got
to
that
point.
he
was
not
in
custody
at
the
time
the
transfer
was
meant.
the
motion
for
transfer
was
meant.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
there's
a
--
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
statute.
i
say
the
statute
is
summoned
on
venue.
it's
just
that
the
–-
it
should
be
taken
into
custody
and
deported.
they
would
be,
i
suppose
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
but
we
always
have
the
question
of
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
whether
it
would
be
fair.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
as
i
say
that
the
--
the
regulation
on
--
i'm
just
not
specific
about
venue.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
that
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
at
the
hearing
and
something
similar.
i
gather
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
don't
have
that
record
here
and
i
--
if
the
fact
that
the
motion
had
been
made
appears
from
the
record
in
the
carlson
against
landon
case,
mr.
hyun
was
one
of
the
people
involved
in
that
case.
that's
where
we
discovered
it
in
the
first
parts.
because
and
in
which
he
--
it
was
part
of
his
allegations
against
since
being
held
in
custody
on
a
general
tone
in
which
it
is
presented
there
was
how
terribly
unfair
of
the
government
to
under
move
the
proceeding
to
hawaii.
but
because
it
was
not
clear
from
that
what
his
status
was,
i
don't
have
the
administrative
record
that
was
being
used.
i
just
asked
him
to
check
on
that
and
then
he
just
--
they
said
he
was
not
in
custody
at
the
time
it
happened.
and
that
he
had
objection
and
by
stipulation
it
was
agreed
not
to
transfer
the
hearings,
and
then
at
that
point,
the
whole
thing
came
to
an
end
so
that's
the
status
of
it.
well
now,
then,
to
get
--
if
we
assume
that
the
hearing
was
properly
held
in
los
angeles,
then
i
think,
since
nobody
made
a
motion
to
do
it
and
since
the
place
of
residence
is
a
normal
place
for
bringing
it,
we
can
start
with
that
assumption.
as
i
said
before,
there
is
no
process
that
i
know
of
by
which
the
immigration
authorities
could
have
compelled
the
witnesses
to
come
from
hawaii
to
los
angeles.
i
don't
know
whether
the
matter
was
explored
or
not,
whether
they
would
have
come
voluntarily.
the
fact
that
the
previous
motion
was
made,
the
fact
that
they
did
intend
is
just
perhaps
the
witnesses
were
not
willing
to
come.
it
is
certainly
clear
from
this
record,
i
think,
that
the
witness
thus
--
at
least
some
of
them
would
not
have
come.
there
was
the
man
who
appeared
and
after
identifying
this
is
new,
claimed
the
privilege
and
gave
no
testimony
at
all.
i
think
it's
also
fair
to
say
from
this
record
that
the
witnesses
had
obviously
not
--
they
all
came
pursuant
to
subpoena.
and
that
when
the
government
called
four
witnesses,
they
presumably
thought
they
had
something
to
offer,
it's
the
fact
remains
of
the
four
only
two
have
a
third
of
somewhat
doubtful
validity,
although,
partly
relied
on
by
the
immigration
officer
none
of
course.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
when
--
when
he's
judging
the
evidence
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
not
only
the
witness
uesugi
who
--
who
must
be
considered
but
much
more
and
much
more
significantly,
the
witness
izuka
whose
testimony
appears
at
page
240
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
in
this
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that,
i
think
there's
some
trial
counsel.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
--
i
was
suggesting
to
your
honor,
i
think
that
some
trial
counsel
might
have
made
a
deliberate
decision
not
to
cross-examine
that
witness.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
take
it,
your
honor,
that
this
was
--
and
that
is
my
point
here.
that
this,
that
certainly,
it
was
reasonable
to
proceed
by
deposition
in
the
first
instance
because
this
was
a
largely,
as
i
read
this
record,
an
exploratory
matter
presumably
of
witnesses
who
would
testify
under
the
compulsion
of
subpoena.
i
don't
know
this
but
the
record
suggests
this
to
me.
there's
one
witness
whom
the
government
thought
had
information
who
came
with
an
attorney
and
claim
the
privilege
and
gave
no
information
whatsoever.
there
is
another
who
gave
a
very
little
information
that
one
could
rely
on
as
proving
anything.
there
was
a
third
since
mr.
uesugi
we've
been
talking
about
whom
in
toto
wrote
certain
things
are
fairly
low,
i
--
i
think
had
some
information
which
if
it
weren't
on
the
basis
of
this
order,
i
think
might
well
have
been
questioned
but
which
did
tend
to
supplement
what
the
testimony
of
the
one
witness
whom
i
think
gave
signs
of
giving
very
explicit
and
damaging
testimony.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
my
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
mr.
izuka
on
largely
around
page
241
and
what
he
did
was
to
testify
that
he
was
in
doubt
a
trained
communist
who
had
been
in
the
party,
withdrawn
out
when
it
would
change
his
character,
who
have
reactivated
the
party
in
1945.
and
in
that
connection,
he
said
he
was
at
three
executive
board
meetings
of
the
communist
party,
executive
board
meetings.
now,
he
himself
was
not
a
member
of
the
executive
board
meeting.
opponents
have
said
something
about
that,
but
he
wouldn't
act
those
executive
board
meetings
as
a
communist
to
discuss
communist
affairs.
and
that
each
of
those
three
executive
board
meetings
of
the
communist
party,
he
found
the
defendant
there
as
a
member
of
--
as
a
representative
from
one
of
the
cells
that
made
up
the
executive
board.
now,
this
is
supplemented
by
the
rather
weaker
testimony,
considerably
weaker
testimony,
mr.
uesugi.
also,
it
went
to
a
more
literate
type
of
witness,
i
think,
one
can
--
whether
it's
english
difficulty
or
not,
i
don't
know
that
mr.
hyun
was
a
member
of
this
more
cell,
these
meetings
that
he
belong
to.
now,
he
said
he
was
a
member
of
the
cell.
mr.
izuka
said
he
found
him
at
the
executive
board
meetings
as
a
representative
of
that
cell.
and
that
brings
me
to
this
question
as
i've
been
trying
to
point
out
that
the
government,
it
seems
to
me,
was
testified
in
the
first
instance
before
it
undertook
either
the
--
i
meant
that
it
could.
i
don't
know
whether
it
could
or
not
have
brought
these
witnesses
to
hawaii
or
of
taking
as
a
matter
of
absolute
(inaudible)
taking
the
defendant
to
hawaii
to
say,
"well,
let's
see
how
far
we
get
with
the
normal
usual
method
of
taking
the
--
the
testimony
of
distant
witnesses
which
is
a
testimony
by
deposition.
now,
i
would
agree
that
there
could
be
situations
where
after
this,
in
a
sense
first,
exploratory
approach
to
these
witnesses.
it
might
--
there
might
be
a
situation
to
tell
it
in
which
the
question
taking
it
all
and
all
in
relation
to
the
fact
that
this
is
deportation
in
relation
to
testimony
of
the
witnesses.
it
would
be
a
mtter
of
due
process
to
bring
the
witnesses
before
the
defendant.
that
is
the
defendant
of
the
witnesses
or
the
witnesses
to
him,
one
way
or
the
other.
i
would
say
we
have
such
a
question.
we
might
have
had
such
a
question
as
though
there
ain't
serious
issue
of
identity
in
this
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
of
identity
in
this
case.
but
however,
way
--
when
it
does
give
or
it
does
not
give
to
the
testimony
in
this
case,
one
thing
is
perfectly
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
and
that
is
that
there
was
no
issue
of
identity.
there
are
statements
in
my
opponent's
brief
that
they're
used
as
an
identifying
picture,
a
means
of
identification
his
attorney's
passport
in
which
his
name
would
appear
on
the
state
service.
well,
the
passport
is
not
printed
in
the
printed
record
here
but
a
photostat
of
it
is
in
the
record
that's
on
file,
the
original
record
that's
on
file
in
this
court.
and
it
appeared
today,
one's
been
talking
the
third
set,
pretty
much
like
our
passports
in
that
one
sheet
of
picture
and
the
other
sheet
has
a
lot
of
attorneys'
writing,
but
there
is
a
name
david
hyun
in
english
on
it.
well,
i
assume
it's
two
different
pages
and
there's
just
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
they
--
the
witnesses
were
not
shown,
just
the
picture,
without
the
name.
and
secondly,
even
when
a
person
before
the
court
knows
what
his
name
is,
he
can't
read
this
record
without
being
perfectly
convinced
that
the
one
thing
nobody
had
any
question
about
was
who
they
were
talking
about,
not
to
say
between
petitioner
here
identified
by
the
standpoint.
even
the
witness
who
--
we
just
don't
give
any
information
when
proven
against
self-incrimination,
immediately
recognized,
petitioner
has
been.
so,
there
was,
as
a
result
of
this,
initial
deposition
taken
of
which
the
petitioner
was
giving
notice
at
the
time
and
place
and
in
fact
that
he
could
be
represented
by
counsel.
it's
a
normal
way
of
doing
this.
there
was
no
issue
of
identity
emerged
from
this.
now,
petitioner
wasn't
there,
but
he
was
given
a
ride
and
which,
in
many
cases,
my
--
people
might
consider
at
least
it's
valuable,
is
the
right
to
be
there.
and
that
is,
that
after
the
testimony
was
taken
on
the
record,
it
was
transcribed,
it
was
served,
uncounseled
for
petitioner
with,
of
course,
opting
petitioner
consult
with
petitioner.
they
had
all
together,
i
think,
about
twomonths
in
which
to
study
it.
they
were
--
it
was
served
on
them
in
--
on
january
22nd,
i
think,
the
record
shows.
on
march
13th,
the
hearing
convened.
counsel
said
he
hadn't
had
time
to
study
it
thoroughly.
he
was
given
additional
time
to
study.
and
with
that,
do
you
want
a
prepared
cross
interrogatory?
do
you
want
to
call
witnesses?
do
you
want
to
have
witnesses
summoned
for
you
in
hawaii?
immigration
service
was
willing
to
use
its
subpoena
power.
he
--
at
one
point
he
said,
"well,
we're
thinking
about
it,"
and
then
he
said,
"no."
now,
when
--
it
may
be
said
about
the
right
of
hawaiian
counsel
or
the
opportunity
of
hawaiian
counsel
to,
of
course,
to
have
adequately
at
the
first
instance
when
counsel,
los
angeles
counsel
for
petitioner
had
had
an
opportunity
to
completely
study
all
these
examinations.
it's
all
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
it's
unconscionable,
unfair
to
say
that
with
all
that
opportunity
when
there
is
no
issue
of
identity
in
the
case,
that
just
because
petitioner
isn't
brought
there
at
government
expense,
that
renders
the
hearing
so
unconscionable
that
must
be
abrogated
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
a
--
a
government
expense,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
has
a
right
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i
take
it
he's
not
far
from
making
his
point,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
i
take
it
that
in
a
question
of
whether
a
court
has
to
decide
whether
a
procedure
is
fundamentally
unfair,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
using
the
normal
method
of
deposition
taking
which
is
the
way
in
which
our
standard
procedures
are
normally
followed,
having
done
as
far
as
we
could
go
with
that,
it
still
becomes
clear
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
we
have.
let
us
say
an
issue
of
identity
on
which
it
can't
be
solved
or
having
cross-examined
the
government's
witnesses
if
counsel
had
come
into
the
hearing
officer
and
said,
"now,
look
here.
look
at
this
record.
you
can
see
from
this
record
that
there's
a
very,
very
close
question
of
credibility."
now,
it
seems
to
me
nobody
can
decide
this
but
the
person
who's
going
to
decide
the
whole
case.
i
think
that's
a
very
different
case
from
the
case
we
have
here.
so,
well--
well
the
petitioner,
of
course,
has
the
right
to
stand
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
court
has
determined
it
whether
the
procedure
was
basically
unfair,
it
is
also
fair
for
the
court
to
take
into
consideration
if
found
that
there
was
nothing
inherently
unfair
in
this
procedure
and
that
if
petitioner
wanted
to
make
the
point
that
in
this
case,
there
was
something
very
special
about
the
fact
of
this
case,
then
our
position
is,
he
hasn't
done
it
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
take
it,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
question
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
take
that
the
question
is,
that
if
petitioner
hasn't
raised
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
i
take
it
that
the
question
is
has
not,
and
not
the
way
to
be
given
to
the
evidence
on
--
on
the
printed
record.
the
question
is
if
there's
something
about
this
case
which
made
his
presence
necessary.
i
mean
he
made
it
so
necessary
that
it
was
up
to
the
government
to
make
it
certain
he
got
there,
by
one
means
either
by
bringing
the
witness
or
not.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
if
this
is
weak
testimony,
possibly
it
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
opportunity
for
cross-examination
was
present
in
this
case.
not
only
was
there
the
opportunity
to
have
counsel
present
at
the
original
taking,
but
as
i
have
said,
after
the
direct
testimony
was
in,
opportunity
was
given
just
in
that
cross-interrogatory.
opportunity
was
given
to
call
witnesses
in
hawaii.
the
defendant,
petitioner
here
chose
not
to
take
advantage
for
that
opportunity.
now,
opportunity
for
cross-examination
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
actual
presence
of
the
accused.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
here,
as
i
attempt
the
outset,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
it's
better
when
everybody
is
in
the
same
process.
that,
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
necessity
of
the
client
being
there
is
so
great
that
when
it's
not
assured
at
government
expense
and
as
a
matter
of
right
regardless
of
the
circumstances,
that
the
mere
fact
that
that
isn't
assured
when
there
is
an
opportunity
for
cross-examination
and
for
counsel.
in
addition,
an
opportunity
which
normally
is
not
available
at
the
trial,
the
opportunity
to
--
in
a
sense
study
a
direct
examination
in
a
way
that
few
of
us
do,
when
the
witness
is
actually
up
before
the
stand,
whether
that
taken
all
in
all
is
unfair.
i
mean,
as
i
said
the
outset,
i
don't
think
that
its
function
of
need
here
is
advocate
in
this
case
or
of
this
court
in
deciding
the
case,
to
decide
whether
this
is
the
very,
very
best
possible
procedure
that
could
have
been
devised.
the
--
the
issue
here
is,
whether
what
was
done
here
with
having
the
depositions
in
hawaii
of
witnesses
who
obviously
came
under
compulsion,
having
that
done
originally
under
notice,
with
notice,
an
opportunity
for
counsel
to
be
present.
thereafter,
given
the
counsel
with
ample
opportunity
to
study
them
was
an
opportunity
to
prepare
for
us
interrogatories,
with
an
opportunity
for
us
only.
to
keep
always
so
as
he's
saying,
he
do
and
never
did,
when
finally
they
throbbed,
they
finally
got
a
witness
all
he
offered
to
prove
was
that
the
communist
party
was
not
the
kind
of
an
organization
of
congress.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
kept
insisting
that
the
depositions
were
not
admissible
at
evidence
because
the
government
had
not
arranged
to
pay
for
his
going
over
or
his
counsel
or
both,
that's
what
he
said.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
said
that,
yes.
he
--
he
kept
saying
that
all
three
of
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
counsel
stated,
at
118
in
making
his
objections
to
the
depositions
at
all,
he
did
say
the
government
hasn't
offered
to
pay
for
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
was
before
the
depositions
were
ordered.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
he
consistently,
throughout
this
proceeding,
kept
taking
the
position
that
it's
a
matter
of
right.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
violence
a
bit.
the
depositions
were
admissible
in
evidence
because
the
government
had
not
transported,
paying
the
expenses
of
transporting
him
or
his
counsel
or
both.
what
we
said
was
that,
he
never
said
he
was
financially
unable
to
employ
counsel
as
was
the
situation
in
the
case,
the
first
circuit
had
decided
sometime
before
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
hearing
denied.
that
didn't
show
up
in
this
case
until
the
hearing
before
then
the
board
of
immigrations
appeals,
which
is
handled
by
counsel
who
was
not
cancelled
down
below.
so
that's
basically
our
position
now,
taking
it
all
and
all
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
which
obvious
desire
of
petitioner
that
the
hearing
remain
in
los
angeles
where
he
had
been
counseled
for
three
years
or
several
years
at
any
rate.
that
with
all
the
opportunity
that
was
given
to
him,
notice
in
the
first
instance
opportunity
to
study,
opportunity
to
cross-examine,
and
opportunity
of
the
cause
of
witnesses.
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
substantial
issue
of
identity,
and
that
if
there
was
anything
to
be
brought
out
by
cross-examination,
we
think
he
first
had
to
show
that
by
using
what
was
available
to
him.
that
on
this
basis,
it
was
not
on
theory
either
to
take
depositions
in
the
first
place
or
to
use
an
evidence
in
the
second
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
violation
of
due
process
and
that
the
order
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
