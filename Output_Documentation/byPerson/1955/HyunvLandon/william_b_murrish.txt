mr.

hyun.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
hyun
versus
landon.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
and
it
is
a
--
a
cause
in
habeas
corpus
to
review
a
final
order
for
deportation.
the
substantive
basis
for
deportation
was
a
charge
under
the
1950
amendment
to
the
1917
immigration
act
for
charged
membership
after
entry
in
the
communist
party.
this
deportation
more
than
many
affects
the
liberty
and
life
of
the
individual
in
sharp
manner.
this
man
is
39
or
40
years
old.
he
came
to
the
united
states
lawfully,
entered
it
lawfully,
and
has
resided
here
ever
since
the
childhood
age
of
seven
years.
he
knows
no
other
land,
he
knows
no
other
language,
he
is
married
to
a
citizen,
he
has
two
children,
both
sons,
both
citizens.
to
him,
deportation
means
a
separation
in
the
words
of
the
ng
fung
ho
case
of
all
that
makes
life
worthwhile.
and
before
i
reach
the
nub
of
the
issue
in
the
case,
i
would
make
one
further
point
about
the
special
circumstances
here
and
that
concerns
itself
with
the
place
of
deportations
specified
in
the
warrant
and
the
record,
namely,
korea
and
the
circumstance
that
in
the
record
in
this
cause,
the
alien
established
to
the
administrative
service
and
made
evidence
of
circumstances
which
are
so
known
historically
as
to
also
lie
within
the
area
of
judicial
knowledge,
namely,
the
jeopardy
to
life
or
of
even
physical
persecution
should
deportation
of
a
person
critical
of
the
regime
of
syngman
rhee
in
korea
placed
him
within
the
physical
control
of
that
nation.
we
have,
therefore,
the
--
in
human
terms,
the
most
serious
consequence
to
an
individual.
now,
i
don't
pretend
that
consequence
alone
controls
anything.
a
death
case
in
criminal
law
also
involved
the
most
extreme
consequence
but
it
does
lay
the
premises
upon
which
we
reach
the
basic
law
question
of
the
cause
which
is
a
question
of
the
quality
and
content
of
procedural
due
process
of
law
in
such
a
deportation.
the
question
factually,
i
believe,
may
be
very
briefly
described.
the
alien,
at
the
time
of
his
hearing,
was
physically
in
the
custody
of
the
immigration
service
in
confinement
in
los
angeles.
his
hearing
was
conducted
in
los
angeles.
however,
at
the
very
outset
of
his
hearing,
and
everything
i
say
is
included
in
our
very
brief
record
here
and
i
will
simply
paraphrase
it
in
--
in
my
opening
statement,
in
the
early
moments
of
the
hearing
after
no
more
than
the
opening
preliminaries
and
questions
going
to
alienage
only
and
after
merely
discussions
of
question
of
a
continuance,
a
motion
was
made
to
take
depositions
of
four
witnesses
in
hawaii.
and
as
developed,
these
four
witnesses
were
called
in
hawaii
and
did
give
their
statements
in
deposition
form
and
this
was
the
soul
and
only
evidence
introduced
of
the
substantive
basis
of
deportability.
now,
at
the
proceedings
held
in
hawaii,
the
--
the
alien
defendant
was
not
present.
he
was
in
jail
in
los
angeles.
neither
was
he
present
or
represented
by
counsel
either
the
counsel
representing
him
in
los
angeles
or
any
other
counsel
appearing
in
hawaii.
that
is
simply
factual.
there
was
no
one
present
in
hawaii
except
the
service
and
its
examining
officer
and
the
witnesses.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
your
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
your
honor,
there
was
a
reference
at
the
outset
of
the
depositions
which
appear
at
the
very
end
of
the
transcript
does
in
exhibit.
there
was
a
reference
by
the
hearing
officer
to
the
fact
that
an
attorney
had
called
him
and
had
said
that
he
had
been
--
this
attorney
had
said
that
he
had
been
asked
to
consider
appearing
for
the
alien
and
that
he
had
been
instructed
not
to
so
appear.
it
later
appears
in
the
record
when
the
depositions
were
offered
into
evidence.
it
is
stated
by
counsel
for
the
record
that
although
it
was
considered
having
counsel
other
than
los
angeles
counsel
appear
in
hawaii
without
the
attendance
of
the
alien
that
it
was
concluded
that
this
was
impractical,
i
believe,
in
counsels
where
he
said
impossible
that
he
would
not
be
able
adequately
to
handle
the
representation
without
conference
and
presence
of
the
alien
and
he
was
no
such
counsel
was
authorized
to
appear
for
him
and
no
counsel
did
appear
for
him.
although,
i
think,
it
is
correct
to
say
that
it
was
contemplated.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
several
points
in
the
record
where
it
is
shown
that
the
alien
having
once
made
request
for
the
basic
rights
which
i
will
argue
for
of
his
right
to
be
there
himself
in
present
during
his
hearing
and
to
have
his
own
attorney
be
present
with
him
that
less
than
that
he
did
consider
alternative.
he
did
consider
whether
that
being
denied,
he
might
submit
written
interrogatories.
he
did
consider
whether
he
might
have
counsel
other
than
his
own
in
hawaii
appeared
for
him.
i
suppose
he
may
have
canvassed
in
his
mind
some
other
conceivable
alternatives
to
him
none
other
than
the
basic
ones
which
were
not
granted
to
him
appeared
to
have
the
meat
and
substance
to
furnish
an
adequate
opportunity
and
he,
therefore,
did
not
resort
to
either
written
interrogatories
nor
did
he
attempt
to
have
counsel
appeared
for
him
in
hawaii
without
his
consultation
or
his
presence.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
your
honor,
i'll
be
very
frank.
i
am
counsel
on
appeal
and
i
did
not
know
until
i
saw
on
the
government
brief
that
in
an
earlier
and
not
in
an
earlier
proceeding
not
related
directly
to
this,
at
least
not
in
this
record,
there
was
some
motion
evidently
made
to
transfer
the
proceedings
to
hawaii
and
this
was
resisted
by
the
alien
who
desired
the
proceedings
to
be
held
in
los
angeles,
i
presume,
where
he
was
and
where
his
counsel
was.
however,
from
that,
i
would
make
the
comment
that
the
alien
basically
asked
that
he
be
present
to
confront,
to
consult
with
his
counsel
and
to
participate
in
cross-examination
at
his
hearing.
where
that
hearing
might
be,
although,
he
might
also
have
positions
respecting
that,
was
not
as
crucial
as
that
the
fact
that
he
should,
at
least,
be
present
wherever
it
be.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
at
some
stages
in
his
--
in
the
record
urge
that
--
that
he'd
be
taken
to
hawaii.
i
--
i
see
your
honor
indicates
the
question.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
--
i
believe,
if
i
were
to
state
my
own
sole
belief,
it
would
be
that
the
hearing
should
have
been
in
los
angeles
and
the
witness
is
brought
there.
however,
the
--
i
would
say
90%
of
my
reasoning
would
be
met
by
a
hearing
and
which
the
alien
was
present
with
counsel
whether
it
had
been
in
hawaii
or
los
angeles
that
the
real
nub
of
the
vice
was
that
he
was
in
jail
while
his
hearing.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
he
was
held
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
away
from.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
if
he
was
present
in
hawaii,
i
would
say
not
meeting
still
the
reserve,
the
10%
which
i
appeal
he
should
have
had
the
hearing
actually
at
his
residence
in
los
angeles.
but
passing
that,
if
he
were
present
in
hawaii,
i
feel
that
a
hearing
in
hawaii
would
then
have
rendered
him
due
process
of
law.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
yes.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
yes
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
your
honor
mr.
william
b.
murrish
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
slightly
in
handicapped
and
i
do
not
know
those
earlier
proceedings.
i
do
not
know
what
the
alien
said
at
that
earlier
time.
nothing
about
this
is
in
this
record.
there
was
no
suggestion,
motion,
thought
by
the
government
that
the
hearing
be
in
hawaii.
in
fact,
the
only
time
that's
referred
to
in
that
manner
is
very
carefully
pointed
out
that
the
hearing
was
in
los
angeles
and
that
only
the
depositions,
although
they
contained
the
entirety
of
the
evidence,
were
taken
in
hawaii
and
he
was
not
taken
nor
was
it
suggested
by
the
government
that
he'd
be
taken
or
the
case
transferred
there.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
--
i
would
though
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
however
answer
my
own.
i
do
not
believe
basically
that
he
does
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
if
he
does
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
there
is
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
nothing
in
the
statute
of
the
regulations
that
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
gives
him
that.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it
appears
from
the
record
that
counsel
replied
that
having
considered
the
depositions,
the
questions
and
the
answers
and
the
nature
of
them,
that
he
considered
that
any
written
interrogatories
would
be
in
substantial
in
effect
and
would
be
futile
would
not
accord
him
a
substantive
opportunity
for
cross-examination
let
along
confrontation
because
they
would
be
so
far
from
the
opportunity
to
give
oral
question
and
to
follow
up
and
to
turn
with
an
answer
and
reply
and
the
--
having
giving
of
that
consideration,
cross-interrogatory,
it
would
consider
the
impractical.
at
one
time,
they
were
characterized
as
impossible.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
no,
no.
no,
the
government
examined
the
witness
--
the
witnesses
in
hawaii
before
a
different
hearing
officer
and
examined
by
a
different
examining
officer
and
the
whole
matter
was
orally
given
and
taken
down
by
a
stenographer
in
the
form
of
a
normal
deposition
except
as
i
put
it
ex
parte,
at
least
ex
parte,
in
the
sense
that
only
one
party
was
there.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
the
petitioner
was
certainly
told
when
and
where
the
hearing
in
hawaii
would
be
and
he
was
told
that
he
could
have
counsel
in
hawaii,
yes.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
he
was
not
present
and
he
was
not
permitted
to
go
there.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
thank
you.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
in
--
in
briefest
statement,
your
honor,
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process
derived
not
from
deportation
law
because
there
is
no
deportation
law
on
the
point,
but
derived
from
three
areas
which
we
feel
in
principle
are
parallel
and
controlling.
firstly,
criminal
law
and
due
process
criminal
law,
and
secondly,
insanity
proceedings,
and
thirdly,
asexualization
operations.
we
find
in
the
law
a
requirement
by
due
process
that
there
be
accorded
in
all
these
fields
where
liberty,
body,
or
life
is
an
issue,
a
quality
of
process
different
and
distinct
from
the
civil
process
which
is
sufficient
to
determine
property
causes
between
private
individuals
where
the
parties
are
relatively
equal.
and
that
where
in
the
law,
liberty
or
life
or
body
hangs
in
balance
and
the
--
one
of
the
parties
is
the
government
with
greatly
superior
resources
and
capacities
that
the
public
and
the
law,
as
well
as
the
individual,
requires
that
there
be
observed
certain
minimum
basic
fundamentals
as
a
safeguard
to
ensure
that
the
law
shall
not
take
life
or
liberty
in
error
or
carelessly
but
only
as
and
where
the
law
truly
applied,
specified.
and
that
of
the
minimums
which
due
process
requires
to
secure
a
fair
trial,
not
merely
fair
to
the
defendant,
but
fair
in
the
sense
of
ensuring
a
just
and
honest
judgment
among
those
minimums
and
indeed
very
basic.
one
perhaps
of
the
most
fundamental
is
the
minimum
requirement
that
the
judgment
and
trial
be
to
the
face
of
the
person
concerned
and
accused
that
he
be
present
to
be
confronted
by
the
court,
the
witnesses,
and
the
evidence.
this
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
you
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
unless
the
man
is
there
except
in
situations
of
rare
necessity
not
relevant
here.
as
for
example,
if
the
witness,
having
once
been
examined
in
a
deposition
where
cross-examination
was
either
had
or
--
or
permitted
as
the
--
the
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
confrontation
too,
confrontation,
where
confrontation
was
possible
like
a
preliminary
hearing.
then,
if
the
witness
dies
or
is
too
ill
to
be
able
actually
come
to
trial
or
is
too
old
or
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
the
case
most
illustrating
it
and
i
don't,
at
the
moment,
recall
and
name
it.
i
think
it
was
the
mott's
case.
if
the
witness
is
beyond
the
process
and
jurisdiction
of
the
trying
body
and
cannot
be
possibly
be
brought
where
indeed
the
government
must
choose
between
a
trial
with
confrontation
--
i
mean
between
a
trial
without
producing
the
witness
and
no
trial
at
all
because
it
is
impossible
to
render
it,
then,
in
those
rare
situations,
the
law
is
compelled.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
well-discussed
in
the
basic
cases
which
state
that
in
criminal
law,
the
purpose
of
requiring
confrontation
is
the
very
opposite
of
the
civil
law
permitting
depositions
and
that
the
very
biggest
purpose
was
to
exclude
as
a
matter
of
due
process
from
civil
--
from
criminal
cases,
the
free
use
of
depositions
permitted
and
appropriate
in
civil
cases.
and
that
the
reason
why
is
because
the
fundamental
requirement
of
fairness
of
confrontation
and
presence,
which
is
a
little
more
than
only
confrontation,
which
should
not
be
forgone
if
it
may
be
possible
to
satisfy.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
at
--
i'll
be
as
honest
as
i
can
be.
at
the
time
the
proceedings
were
held
in
hawaii,
he
was
not
even
told
that
he
physically
could
go
to
hawaii
and
he
was
in
jail.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
that
was
in
a
different
proceeding,
your
honor.
that
was
not
in
this
proceeding
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
and
it
is
not
before
this
court.
it
would
--
there
was
an
earlier
deportation
proceeding
under
the
unamended
1917
act.
and
at
some
stage,
the
stage
i
am
not
familiar,
at
some
stage,
that
proceeding
was
superseded
by
a
new
warrant
under
the
1950
amendment
and
new
proceedings
were
instituted
and
it
is
that
record
only
which
is
here
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
in
this
case,
your
honor,
he
was
confined.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
he
was
physically
confined.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
he
was
physically
confined
and
by
that
token,
unable
to
attend
except
that
it
was
later
stated
in
the
hearings.
after
the
depositions
had
been
brought
back,
it
was
stated
in
the
record
that
if
he
would
pay
his
own
financial
way
and
guards
to
secure
him
that
the
service
would
permit
him
to
go
to
hawaii
to
cross-examine.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
now
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
he
was
interned
by
direction
of
the
attorney
general
and
it
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
it
is
stated
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
it
is
stated
in
the
record
that
he
was
confined
without
bail
by
order
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
why
bail
was
denied?
mr.
william
b.
murrish
to
my
knowledge
in
this
record,
that
would
not
appear
merely
the
fact
that
it
was
denied.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
bail
came
later
and
after
he
is
presently
on
bail.
administrative
bail
in
the
sum,
i
believe,
of
$5000
and
i
believe
that
originated,
that
bail
originated
and
has
been
continued
after
these
proceedings
were
completed
and
terminated
and
not
before.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
yes.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
i
am
urging,
your
honor,
that
derived
from
due
process,
there
is
a
requirement
in
criminal
trial
of
presence
of
the
accused
at
his
hearing.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
but
not
derived
from
say
the
sixth
amendment
or
not
derived
from
any
state
constitutional
right,
but
from
due
process
that
the
accused
must
be
present
at
least
in
a
serious
criminal
trial
and
at
least
at
the
important
and
substantive
stages.
and
it
is
my
contention
that
the
same
due
process
which
requires
that
as
a
safeguard
of
fairness
in
a
criminal
cause
and
which,
likewise,
requires
that
same
right
or
presence
in
insanity
proceedings
and
asexualization
proceedings
also
requires
that
same
right
of
presence
in
a
deportation
proceedings
where
two
liberty
or
even
life
may
be
at
stake,
because
they
all
derived
from
the
same
principle
that
the
public
as
well
as
the
private
individual
must
be
given
security.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
in
the
sense
that
due
process
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
requires
it.
well,
i
make
that
distinction
because
originally,
if
you
go
to
the
criminal
law,
the
right
of
presence
derives,
historically
derives
in
criminal
trials
from
common
law
and
then
in
--
in
all
of
the
several
constitutional
provisions
of
the
states
giving
the
right
of
jury
trial.
from
that,
they
derive
partly
the
right
to
be
present
because
the
very
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
includes
the
right
to
confront
the
jury.
the
right
to
have
a
public
trial
includes
the
right
to
be
there
yourself.
the
right
to
have
counsel
includes
the
right
to
consult
and
all
of
these
maybe
strictly
criminal
trial
rights
originally.
and
it
is
not
upon
any
of
those
in
which
i
lay
reliance,
but
rather
upon
the
requirement
of
federal
due
process
which
will
not
permit
a
state
to
change
its
state
constitutional
provisions
to
the
extent
of
violating
the
secured
right
of
an
accused
to
be
present
at
the
substantive
portions
of
his
trial.
and
it's
that
due
process
security
of
fair
hearing
rather
than
any
strictly
criminal
one
only
upon
which
i
rely.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
your
honor,
i
do
indeed
urge
the
position
you
just
stated.
i
additionally
--
the
position
that
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
well,
the
position
that
because
liberty
is
at
stake,
as
a
general
rule
of
due
process
just
as
generally
in
insanity
proceedings,
i
believe
that
generally
that
should
be
the
rule
in
deportation
at
least
--
at
least
where
it
reaches
the
substantive
portions
of
the
case
and
is
not
a
peripheral
or
superfluous
part
only
like
maybe
one
out
of
25
witnesses
that
might
be
a
different
situation.
but
where
at
least
where
it
reaches
a
substantial
and
a
material
portion
of
the
record,
i
believe,
it
should
be
a
general
rule
and
i
believe
it
is
particularly
called
for
in
this
case
because
of
aggravated
circumstances,
number
one,
the
entire
trial
being
thus
characterized
here
at
least
the
entire
substantive
trial.
no
single
substantive
witness
ever
appeared
at
the
only
hearing
of
which
the
alien
was
rendered
present.
in
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
100
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
100%
except
for
the
fact
of
foreign
birth.
that
was
the
only
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
alienage
was
received
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
i
take
both
positions,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
i
believe,
in
short,
that
the
--
the
right
to
be
present
is
so
fundamental
in
history
behind
the
common
law
and
criminal
law.
it
is
so
basic
that
this
court
has
said,
“it
is
as
indispensable
as
the
right
of
trial
itself.”
that
is
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
diaz
case.
in
another
case,
it
has
been
said
that
it
must
be
assumed
that
it
--
that
it
is
indispensable
to
a
fair
defense
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
in
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
indeed,
your
honor,
and
i
draw
that
parallel
because
of
the
reasons
given
in
history
and
in
the
criminal
law
field
for
requiring
presence.
i
call
this
court's
attention
to
its
decision,
for
example
in
hopt
against
utah
where
it
was
earnestly
stated
that
presence
is
required
because
of
a
deep
public
concern
that
life
not
be
taken
in
error
or
without
a
fair
and
a
just
judgment.
that
--
and
the
reasoning
there
is
that
it
would
be
against
the
law
for
the
defendant
himself
to
take
his
life
except
by
and
in
accordance
with
law.
he
does
not
have
the
personal
right
and
the
state
must
see
that
the
trial
which
forfeits
his
life
has
those
minimums
which
guarantee
that
there
will
be
a
fair
judgment
and
one
of
those
minimums
is
that
he'd
be
there,
that
judgment
be
to
his
phase.
and
i
also
note
the
circumstance
that
this
right
is
--
is
instinctive.
there's
an
instinctive
feature
in
--
in
the
criminal
law
cases
making
this
right
jurisdictional
even
where
it
is
not
placed
in
a
constitutional
or
in
a
particular
statute.
it
is
conceived
that
the
trial
has
no
power
to
proceed
without
the
person
to
be
judged,
and
it
goes
very
deep
into
history.
and
i
therefore
say
that
a
right
so
fundamental
there
because
the
reason
for
it
is
that
it
is
indispensable
to
securing
fairness
of
judgment
must
equally
be
secured
where
the
purpose
and
need
for
fairness
is
comparable
and
parallel
as
it
is,
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
been
denominated
civil
wherever
life
or
body
or
liberty
are
at
issue
because
that
is
the
reason
which
calls
in
public
terms
for
carefulness
and
safeguard
in
judgment.
and
i
--
i
point
out
that
due
process
even
in
criminal
law
does
not
secure
the
niceties
of
trial
which
are
generally
secured
in
the
criminal
field.
there
is
no
due
process
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
there
is
no
due
process
right
at
least
by
the
majority
decisions
of
this
court.
there
is
no
due
process
right
to
the
protection
of
self-incrimination,
no
due
process
right
to
grand
jury
indictment,
but
certain
very,
very
basic
fundamentals
that
the
trial
hall
not
be
submitted,
subordinated
to
mob
intimidation,
more
against
them
see
that
the
judge
shall
not
have
a
source
of
payment
which
gives
him
a
motive
to
convict
in
the
tumi
case
or
that
the
state
shall
not
knowingly
seek
a
conviction
by
perjured
evidence
as
in
the
munich
case.
that
these
and
the
rochin
case
against
violence
or
brutality,
these
cases
lay
down
certain
minimums
so
fundamental,
i
think,
in
the
language
in
rochin
is
a
required
respect
for
the
decencies
of
civilized
conduct.
they
are
the
fundamentals
without
breach
a
trial
is
no
fair
trial
at
all.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
he
was
--
at
the
hearing
preceding,
the
depositions,
he
--
a
motion
was
simply
made
to
take
the
depositions
of
four
persons.
he
began
to
make
--
counsel
began
to
make
an
objection.
he
asked,
“should
i
make
this
objection
written
or
oral?”
and
the
hearing
officer
said,
“you
can
make
it
either
way.”
he
said,
“all
right,
i'll
make
it
oral,”
and
he
began
to
make
objections.
he
did
not
complete
making
his
objections
before
the
hearing
officer
made
after
a
few
side
issues,
made
a
ruling
that
the
depositions
would
be
ordered.
then
in
protest
to
this
ruling
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
up
to
that
point,
he
had
been
interrupted
in
point
of
stating
his
objections
and
he
--
he
asked
--
for
example
on
page
116,
counsel
is
saying,
“i
want
first
of
all
for
the
record
to
show
that
i
am
not
finish
making
my
motion
to
--
my,”
--
it
says,
“my
motion
to
objections
to
the
taking
of
the
depositions.
i
have
not
finished.”
and
then
it
says
counsel
be
given
an
opportunity
to
renew
his
objections
at
the
proper
time
and
a
different
issue
was
taken
up
on
the
next
page
without
a
--
an
opportunity
to
renew
it.
the
--
the
examining
--
the
hearing
officer
at
page
117
says,
“the
motion
of
the
examining
officer
to
take
deposition
is
granted.”
and
then
there
is
the
important
statement
by
counsel
on
page
118
in
which
he
protest
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
complete
his
objections
and
he
says
that
the
examining
officer
has
merely
made
a
motion.
he
has
not
stated
what
he
expects
to
obtain
in
those
depositions.
has
not
stated
why
those
depositions
cannot
be
taken
here
in
los
angeles.
why
the
persons
cannot
be
present,
has
not
offered
to
have
counsel
or
the
respondent
or
both
present
at
government's
expense.
no
reason
whatsoever
offered.
you
haven't
listened
to
my
objections
to
the
motion
and
yet,
you
grabbed
the
motion
to
overlook
my
objections
notwithstanding
that
i
haven't
even
finished
making
them.
now,
there
is
an
important
circumstance
connected
with
that
in
that.
at
some
stage,
it
was
suggested,
i
believe,
in
the
reply
brief
that
a
written
brief
might
have
elaborated
these
objections.
but
on
the
very
next
page,
119,
the
brief
is
shown
to
consist
of
a
brief
to
be
submitted
after
the
hearing
is
completed
to
the
commissioner
in
washington
and
that
the
rule
--
the
statements
by
the
hearing
officer
at
119
is,
the
ruling
still
stands.
counsel
may
enlarge
on
his
exceptions
in
his
brief
by
counsel
to
whom,
may
i
ask,
by
the
hearing
officer,
it
will
go
to
the
commissioner
of
the
united
states
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
then
down
just
a
bit.
i
have
already
had
a
rule
--
the
hearing
is
continued
and
consel
and
the
examining
officer
will
be
notified
of
the
date
of
the
resumed
hearing.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
he
--
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
william
b.
murrish
he
makes
it
in
the
statement
at
page
118.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
the
government
has
made
no
statement
why
the
persons
cannot
be
present,
has
not
offered
to
have
counsel
or
the
respondent
or
both
present
at
government's
expense.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
no,
this
is
in
byplay
after
the
depositions
have
been
ordered
but
before
they
have
been
taken,
your
honor.
this
at
the
time
that
the
depositions
are
being
ordered
and
counsel
is
protesting
the
taking
of
them
in
hawaii
and
states,
as
i
just
stated.
there
has
not
offered
to
have
counsel
of
the
respondent
or
both
present
at
government's
expense.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
now
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
it's
incorrect
in
import.
it's
accurate
in
literal
sense.
if
you
read
the
word
“this
hearing,”
that
refers
very
carefully
stated,
that
refers
to
the
hearing
of
which
we
had
just
been
discussing
at
pages
118,
preceding
the
taking
of
the
deposition.
and
it
is
true
that
at
no
time
in
the
course
of
that
hearing
did
he
state,
that
he
was
financially
unable
to
retain
counsel
on
honolulu
or
to
send
his
california
counsel
to
hawaii.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
he
raised,
your
honor,
the
question
of
financial
inability
to
pay
to
send
himself,
counsel
and
guards
to
hawaii.
he
raised
that
literally
at
the
stage
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
he
--
i
would
say
it
is
fair
to
say
from
the
record,
he
did
not
conceive
that
even
with
capacity
to
pay
his
way
there,
he
would
be
permitted
to
go
until
after
the
depositions
had
been
taken
because
before
they
were
taken,
he
was
not
told
there
was
anyway
he
could
be
there.
but
--
and
when
it
was
stated
then
that
it
would
have
to
be
at
his
expense,
the
evident
plain
circumstance
of
the
inability
of
the
petitioner
to
do
that
was
simply
self-apparent
at
that
hearing
and
nothing,
nothing
was
said
except
that
no
avail
of
the
offer
was
made.
but
at
the
time
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
the
contention
was
made
specifically
that
as
an
aggravated
circumstance,
he
could
not
even
buy
a
fair
trial
because
he
could
not
afford
to
send
himself
with
guards
and
counsel
to
hawaii.
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
not
only
is
that
a
--
in
my
view
of
the
law
a
--
in
itself,
a
timely
raising
of
the
issue
because
the
board
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
ultimate
authority,
but
in
addition,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
timely
or
not
ruled
upon
that
objection
of
financial
inability
and
on
the
merits
and
ruled
the
financial
inability
or
no
financial
inability.
there
was
no
right
on
his
part
to
be
taken
there
except
that
if
he
could
pay
his
way.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
and
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
decision,
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
58
and
is
quoted
in
my
reply
brief
at
page
21.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
yes,
and
i
hadn't
quite
finished
my
point
about
the
original
hearing,
namely,
that
counsel
was
stopped
in
the
midst
of
making
objections
at
the
original
hearing.
and
so
far
as
content
of
objections
to
the
hearing
officer,
this
was
in
large
part
reached
by
further
discussion
later,
when
the
depositions
were
brought
back
to
los
angeles
in
terms
of
objections
to
not
allowing
confrontation
for
purposes
of
cross-examination.
and
in
the
course
of
those
several
objections,
all
of
the
contentions
that
the
--
there
was
a
right
to
confer
with
counsel,
a
right
to
confront
the
witness,
a
right
to
participate
in
cross-examination
and
then
nothing
short
of
that
would
satisfy
due
process.
all
of
those
objections
were
made
to
the
hearing
officer
several
times
in
terms
of
supporting
confrontation
for
cross-examination
and
they
were
always
disallowed
and
on
their
merits,
not
on
procedural
or
grounds
of
time.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
no.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
no.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
they're
arrested
him
under
a
new
warrant
and
began
proceedings
all
over
again.
they
arrested
him
under
a
new
warrant,
having
nothing,
no
direct
relation
to
anything
preceding
it
and
tried
him
under
the
new
warrant
and
in
that
proceeding
they
simply
proposed
to
take
the
deposition
in
hawaii.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
believe
you
are
correct
that
the
1950
act
had
not
become
effective
at
that
time.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
specifically
i
believe
the
original
charge
under
the
unamended
act
was
for
charged
membership
after
entry
in
an
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
changed
charge
under
1950
amended
act
was
charged
membership
in
the
communist
party
after
entry.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
take
it
so
from
the
government's
brief
i
was
not
counsel
at
that
stage.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
yes.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
your
honor,
as
i
would
understand
for
example
the
rule
against
mob
intimidation
of
a
trial,
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
make
a
trial
valid
that
under
the
coercion
of
a
mob,
witnesses
were
coerced
into
testifying
assumably
and
on
their
face
to
guilt.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
that's
true.
if
a
man
is
tried
in
absentia,
the
case
made
in
his
absence
upon
its
phase
does
not
show
the
weaknesses
which
a
trial
in
presence
would
test
and
give
safeguard
against.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
except,
your
honor,
that
the
want
of
fair
trial
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
knocks
out
in
due
process
since
the
validity
of
any
result
it
may
have
come
to.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
this
is
a
right
which
does
not
show
its
--
its
fruits
until
exercised
for
example
until
cross-examination
has
had
almost
every
witness
upon
direct
examination
or
at
least
seldom
of
witness
on
direct
examination
discloses
the
weaknesses
of
his
testimony.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
is
the
witness
--
i
believe
i
can
find
it
rapidly.
i
think
that
is
about
238
or
239,
the
witness
is
uesugi.
234,
counsel
says,
the
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
234,
it's
the
witness
and
this
is
the
witness
uesugi,
says,
“my
belief
is
that
the
meetings
i
have
been,
i
have
seen
him
there,
so
i
presume
he
is
a
communist.”
these
meetings
--
“well,
what
type
of
meetings?”
“well,
they
were
educational
meetings
sometimes
social.”
“but
who
sponsored
them?”
then
he
gives
persons
who
sponsored
them.
there's
some
place
that
he
does
refer
to
the
procedure
in
the
direct
questions.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
he
was
important
in
the
sense
that
of
the
four
witnesses
in
hawaii,
only
two
were
accepted
by
the
hearing
officer
as
having
evidence
value.
one
refused
to
testify
and
the
--
the
other,
even
on
his
direct
examination,
was
considered
to
be
a
witness
without
evidentiary
consequence.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
this
is
one
of
the
two
witnesses.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
oh,
here
it
is
at
page
238.
“you
know
this
because
of
your
familiarity
with
communist
procedures,
is
that
correct?”
“yes.”
and
then
somewhere,
he
says,
“did
you
have
any
reason?”
and
then,
there's
another
place
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
it
seems
to
me
that
that
--
that
that
perhaps
illustrates
the
point
i
was
making
in
my
last
reply
that
the
untested
and
particularly
read
testimony
where
the
testimony
is
essentially
given
in
the
question
and
it
is
only
answered
yes
by
the
witness.
and
at
one
place
he's
asked,
“do
you
have
any
reason
not
to
believe
that
he's
a
communist?”
and
he
says,
“no,
i
have
no
reason
not
to
believe.”
indeed,
there
was
no
--
one
of
the
features
here
while
i
feel
the
right
is
broader
than
that
particular
case.
one
of
the
features
here
is
that
the
hearing
officer
in
hawaii,
not
once
exercised
any
supervision
or
restraint
over
the
character
of
the
examination
or
asked
a
single
testing
question,
the
examining
officer
asked
questions
which
--
which
any
counsel
present
could
have
readily
objected
to
leading
and
conclusionary
questions
and
then,
when
that's
significant
beyond
that,
when
the
depositions
are
offered
in
los
angeles,
the
middle
two-thirds
of
the
transcript
consists
of
offering
question
by
question
and
answer
by
answer,
the
deposition
and
there
are
maybe
200
objections,
including
objections
that
it
would
seem
impossible
to
disallow
and
not
a
single
objection
is
sustained.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
surety
of
restraint
if
it
were
possible
to
cure
examination
without
presence
of
counsel
and
cross-examination.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
it's
my
belief,
your
honor,
that
the
regulations
at
that
time
and
now
indicate
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
hearing
officer
to
oversee
the
examination
and
indicate
that
this
--
i
don't
believe
they
say
so
explicitly,
but
indicate
that
this
would
be
the
more
so
as
to
an
unrepresented
defendant.
and
basically,
put
upon
the
hearing
officer,
the
purpose
of
a
fair
and
judicial
hearing.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
do
not
know
that,
your
honor,
or
perhaps
counsel
for
the
government
can
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
i
believe
that
when
it
is
considered
how
this
evidence
was
achieved,
that
is
without
the
securities
of
a
trial
attended
by
--
but
one
side,
i
believe
that
a
serious
issue
could
be
made
that
the
one
side
of
the
evidence
should
not
support
a
judgment
affecting
liberty.
however,
i
did
not
make
that
point
in
my
petition
--
and
my
petition
and
my
thesis
and
my
reasoning
and
principle
are
that
the
man
was
denied
a
due
process
right
to
be
tried
in
his
presence.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
the
depositions
or
at
least
examination
outside
the
presence
of
the
tribunal
can
even
occur
in
a
criminal
cause
where
there
is
impossibility.
my
basic
point
here
is
that
fair
trial
was
needlessly
lost,
that
these
witnesses
were
hailed
and
hearty
and
within
the
federal
jurisdiction
and
that
there
was
the
sacrifice
of
--
of
one
of
the
most
fundamental
of
constitutional
securities
without
the
kind
of
exceptional
necessity
such
as
deaf
or
illness
or
beyond
jurisdiction
which
has
in
due
process
made
exceptions.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
yes,
and
i
would
say
particularly
so,
where
the
witness
concerned
is
not
a
peripheral
or
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
in
a
substantive
portion
of
the
case,
yes.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
this
court
in
schneider
against
massachusetts
has
already
indicated
that
there
is
a
broader
right
and
a
different
right
from
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation,
a
right
of
presence
arising
from
the
due
process
portion
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
does
obtain
in
criminal
causes
and
the
same
comparable
right
has
been
extended.
and
i
would
emphasize
and
i
would
feel
that
in
principle,
it
must
plainly
be
in
principle
that
in
the
strictly
civil
proceedings
of
insanity
confinement
or
about
the
operation
that
we
would
--
it
would
not
be
contemplated
that
a
man
could
be
put
behind
bars
allegedly
for
his
own
best
interest.
and
in
a
strictly
civil
proceeding
if
he
denied,
indeed,
that
he
was
insane
and
the
evidence
against
him
if
a
picture
of
this
record,
a
photograph
of
this
record
were
transported
or
could
be
into
an
insanity
proceeding
if
we
could
conceive
of
a
federal
court
having
such
jurisdiction.
and
a
man
being
confined
as
insane
in
los
angeles
by
witnesses,
who
appeared
in
hawaii
while
the
man
was
not
present,
was
not
represented,
i
--
i
can't
conceive
but
that
the
principle
of
fair
trial
of
due
process
would
apply
there.
and
i
reason
that
since
that
is
civil
and
every
bit
of
civil
as
this
deportation,
the
controlling
circumstances
the
jeopardy
to
liberty
and
to
life
and
that
the
basic
principle
being
that
society
cannot
tolerate
error
and
unsafeguard
of
judgments
were
a
man's
life.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
feel
that
the
respondent's
brief
tends
to
confirm
my
principle.
half
of
respondent's
cases
are
strictly
civil
cases
or
civil
statutes.
one,
for
example,
deals
with
protecting
perishable
seeds,
a
statute
protecting
seeds
and
hays
from
impurities
and
imports
there's
permitted
liberal
depositions
in
the
proceedings
affecting
that.
the
civil
cases
affect
tort
damages,
a
cargo
is
injured
or
damaged
in
an
ocean
trip
and
the
parties
are
permitted
freely
to
take
civil
deposition.
it's
my
contention
that
these
do
not
parallel
the
right
to
life
and
to
liberty.
and
that
a
liberty
proceeding
is
not
a
due
process
proceeding
unless
the
fundamentals
prescribed
by
due
process
including
the
right
of
presence
as
in
insanity
and
the
operation
cases
is
respected.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well,
i
would
answer
first
in
principle
that
i
feel,
if
a
man's
liberty
or
life
is
at
stake
that
whatever
the
proceeding,
it's
better
to
air
in
not
doing
it
than
to
air
in
doing
it
unfairly
and
that
presence
and
the
right
to
participate
and
be
at
the
trial
is
so
fundamental.
it
should
always
be
respected
particularly
where
the
matter
is
not
sufficient,
is
not
established
by
other
evidence
independently.
and
i
would
think,
that
if
the
only
witness
available
in
a
deportation
case
to
establish
a
substantive
and
--
and
crucial
issue
lived
in
china
that
the
witness
would
have
to
come
from
china
or
provisions
would
have
to
be
made
for
confrontation
of
the
witness
there.
somehow,
confrontation
would
have
to
be
had,
but
the
more
so
in
the
case
at
bar
where
the
entire
evidence
and
relating
to
the
substantive
basis,
not
to
alienage
or
something
like
burden,
but
the
basis
for
the
deportation
comparable
in
all
respects
to
a
criminal
proceeding
or
insanity
proceeding
in
such
a
situation
at
least,
the
entirety
of
the
trial
and
all
of
the
witnesses
should
not
be
suffered
to
testify
ex
parte.
thank
you.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
that
i
think
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
no,
your
honor.
in
their
--
in
their
reply
brief,
they
took
the
position
that
they
were
not
sure
and
i
would
say
that
that's
a
more
accurate
statement
of
law.
the
law
gives
them
the
power.
it's
very
evident
in
the
1970
statute.
it
gives
them
the
power
to
subpoena.
it
doesn't
say
that
it's
limited
and
i
don't
think
you'd
know
until
it
was
tested
whether
it
was
limited
or
not
and
as
far
as
the
power
of
the
district
court
in
hawaii
to
order
a
person
to
appear
even
outside
their
jurisdiction,
they
could
make
such
an
order.
it
would
make
many
--
the
orders
in
the
property
cases
or
divorce
cases
requiring
people
to
do
things
so
long
as
we
have
in
--
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
them,
we
can
tell
them
what
to
do
and
enforce
it.
no,
i
wouldn't
take
that,
but
i
would
agree
that
it
has
not
been
tested
or
decided
and
i
would
take
the
final
position
that
the
constitution,
what
the
constitution
requires
and
the
federal
government
has
jurisdictional
capacity
to
supply.
it
has
a
way
and
must
find
a
way
under
the
constitution
to
supply.
would
you
mind
if
i
make
one
statement
in
response?
mr.
william
b.
murrish
just
one
thing
and
that
is,
that
it
has
been
said
that
there
is
no
issue
of
identity
and
i
just
want
to
leave
with
this
court
this
thought.
the
--
it's
in
the
record,
the
picture
of
the
passport
that
bears
the
name
of
the
person
on
its
face.
now,
it
seems
to
me
unconscionable
to
say,
that
when
a
man
shows
such
a
passport
and
picture
says,
"yes.
that's
david
hyun,"
and
then
afterwards,
consistently
uses
that
name.
to
say
from
that,
that
there's
no
question
of
identity
when
the
whole
basis
of
this
disassociation
in
people
and
without
the
opportunity
of
the
person
to
have
been
there
and
to
cross-examine
is
to
reach
the
conclusion
which
would
always
appear
on
the
one-sided
story
of
a
false
witness
or
a
mistaken
witness,
false
or
mistaken.
it
never
appears
until
he's
cross-examined
and
there's
a
great
difference
between
identifying
people
when
liberty
and
life
were
at
stake
in
person
and
identifying
him
from
a
picture
that's
got
their
name
beside
it
and
tells
the
answer
just
as
all
the
questions
were
leading.
the
identification
is
leading
in
the
character
of
the
footnote.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
your
honor,
my
client,
because
of
the
parallel
between
the
deportation
proceedings
and
the
criminal
law,
he
was
required
or
at
least
felt
impelled
to
take
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
the
substantive
issue.
he
was
disabled
thereby,
in
responding.
his
only
defense
was
defense
and
cross-examination.
he
was
deprived
of
that
and
that
left
only
a
one-sided
story.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
well
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
there's
a
difficulty
in
my
answering
that
which
comes
from
the
fact
that
a
person
would
not
want
to
where
there's
the
opportunity
that
it
may
ultimately
be
cross-examination
to
disclose
but
the
cross-examination
would
be.
but
i
would
say
that
i
am
advised
that
there
is
a
serious
question
but
that
the
most
--
what
has
been
pointed
to
as
the
most
important
witness
here
would
not
have
testified
the
same
way
had
he
confronted
the
individual.
he
would
not
have
testified
as
he
did.
mr.
william
b.
murrish
no,
i
don't
believe
even
in
a
criminal
case
that
the
defendant
would
have
such
a
right
and
i
don't
press
my
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
--
law
of
beyond
the
criminal
--
mr.
william
b.
murrish
i
--
i
suppose
he
would
have
if
the
government,
if
the
subpoena
power
is
sufficient
to
bring
government
witnesses
from
hawaii,
then
the
subpoena
power
would
be
sufficient
to
bring
those
same
with,
i
mean,
like
witnesses
on
his
behalf
to
los
angeles,
the
proper
place
for
hearing
and
he
would
have
that.
but
i
don't
think
he
has
that
position
by
it.
