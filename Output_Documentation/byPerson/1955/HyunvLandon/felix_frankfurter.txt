justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
for
information,
that
it's
implicitly,
the
chief
justice's
question
as
long
as
i
hold
--
hold
the
authority
to
be,
does
the
--
does
the
deport
--
the
potential
deportee
have
a
choice
as
to
the
place
of
holding
the
hearing?
and
you
say,
i
do
want
to
go
there
and
i
don't
want
to
go
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
would
you
tell
us
that
when
you
come
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
get
to
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
could
have
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he'd
be
asking
its
one
thing,
if
he
--
if
he
merely
going
to
object
and
--
and
determination
by
somebody
else,
it
may
be
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
appear
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
the
record
why
he
was
interned
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assume
--
i
assume
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
again
we'll
have
to
direct
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
appear
why
he
was
not
at
large
on
bail
to
confine
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
give
the
reasons
why
that
action
is
taken.
i
mean
we
have
no
knowledge
derived
from
the
record
that
may
be
put
before
it,
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
bail
was
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
mr.
justice
harlan's
question?
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
did
say,
“we
have
to
lay
down
the
general
rule
such
as
this
court
laid
down
in
johnson,
observed
proper
aid
of
counsel
in
all
for
this,
not
that
intricate
(inaudible)
do
i
understand
you,
permit
this
court
in
this
case,
the
proposition
that
he
must
lay
down
as
a
general
rule
of
general
applicability
in
all
deportation
cases
that
a
potential
deportee
must
be
personally
be
present
at
the
time
that
any
--
and
the
depositions
are
as
--
as
a
legal
mode
of
procedure
to
rule
out,
is
that
your
position
or
are
you
talking
about
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
case
which
may
present
or
may
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
present
some
special
circumstances,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
this
last,
what
you're
saying
now,
as
i
understand
you,
that
is
in
this
case,
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
immigration
authority
was
practically
under
a
trial
then.
this
thing
against
this
petition
for
deportation
was
based
upon
evidence
given
by
way
of
deportation
in
hawaii
without
the
presence
of
the
deportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
if
you
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
we
have
to
take
the
difference
how
substantially.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
like
substantial
or
peripheral,
you
know
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
difference
whether
you
answer
your
argument
with
reference
to
this
case
is
they
found
it
in
petition
or
whether
you
ask
this
to
lay
down
a
general
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
briefly
have
--
you
can
cite
all
of
those
cases
and
can
even
file
a
mark,
file
a
mark
because
there's
no
quarreling
about
that
that
in
a
criminal
case,
this
is
required
and
against
that
you
have
another
character
of
authority
and
various
presences
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
so,
you
can't
rest
on
that
line
of
--
on
the
line
of
criminal
cases,
except
you
can
draw
from
that
considering
which
you
argue
of
equally
relevant
to
this
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
testimony
in
which
you
will
have
into
thinking
then
that
i'm
not,
in
which
a
chief
witness
said
he
identified
him
because
he
was
--
he
must
have
been
a
communist
because
he
was
present
at
the
meeting
and
--
and
he
would
testify
to
communist
from
his
knowledge
of
communist
procedure,
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
his
relation
to
the
proof?
what
was
his
relation,
his
evident
relation
to
the
conclusion
which
went
against
this
petitioner?
was
he
an
important
witness?
i
mean,
can
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
one
of
the
two
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
haven't
quite
read
what
she
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
that,
before
that
72.
was
there
anyone
who
told
that
these
meetings
were
known
to
you
as
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
not
that
i
know
of?
you
say
definitely,
all
the
persons
at
this
meeting
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
but
according
to
my
reading,
anybody
who's
in
that
certain
particular
matter
stand
that,
what
they
call
meeting,
you
were
there,
well
i
think
it's
congress.
“do
you
know
the
difficulty
that's
been
said
of
the
communist
procedure?”
“yes”.
i
guess
on
that
testimony
it
was
fair,
it
would
come
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
neither
can
one
state
a
civil
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
those
cases
--
in
those
cases,
questions
arose
in
which
the
civil
procedure
was
being
acted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
the
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask,
ms.
rosenberg?
you
said
that
--
that
there
could
be
no
compulsion
by
power
to
bring
the
witness
from
--
from
hawaii
to
be
transferred
to
los
angeles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
if
you
tell
me
this
is
so,
i
dare
you
to
look
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
ms.
--
ms.
rosenberg,
this
business
as
we've
already
clarified
as
to
put
the
issue
and
i
think
your
position
is
down
to
it,
on
what
is
to
me
a
clarified
way
by
--
i
say,
you
don't
get
answers
by
pulling
out
of
cases
that
this
is
civil
one
not
criminal.
that's
the
mean
--
the
meaning
of
that.
the
government
has
to
put
in
a
certain
box,
take
the
denaturalization.
to
be
sure,
several
of
the
bills
of
rights
provisions
do
not
apply
to
this
court
than
the
heart
of
--
in
your
holding
to
the
(inaudible)
case
has
made
a
great
big
difference
between
the
manner
in
which
a
judgment
can
be
secured
in
that
denaturalization
case
in
the
manner
in
which
the
judgment
can
be
secured
and
the
case
is
now
reformed,
submitted
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
not
proper
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
--
would
you
agree
if
that
is
the
purpose.
then
the
particular
record
is
not
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
--
i
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
i
should
like
to
know,
namely,
what
extent
of
deportee,
essential
deportee
wishes
to
control
the
transfer
of
a
case
of
particular
locals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
express
some
rates
and
it
would
be
taken
to
counsel
that
it
be
granted,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
about
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
hear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
did
not
imply
that
it's
ordinance
of
the
evidence.
my
question
was
meant
to
imply,
said
it's
rather
shocking
to
me
that
that
kind
of
evidence
would
be
the
basis
of
the
new
conclusion.
i
think
if
that
witness
will
be
cross-examined
by
any
kind
of
a
competent
lawyer
in
five
minutes,
it
would
have
accomplished.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
i'm
troubled
that
the
government
can
enlist
its
testimony
as
loose
as
for
me
that
i'm
persuasive
and
fundamentally
meaningless
that
that
is
the
basis
on
which
important
action
was
taken.
well,
follow
to
say
whether
there
must
have
been
something
because
he
was
there.
what
kind
of
evidence
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
counsel
--
did
the
counsel
formally
object
to
the
proceeding
in
hawaii
and
that
it
deprived
him
of
attendance,
is
that
as
a
matter
of
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
was
that
--
did
he
made
here
the
objection
that
is
now
made?
that
if
some
said,
you
have
this
deposition
to
take
into
hawaii,
and
this
time
present
and
you
must
take
me
there,
did
the
counsel
make
that
objection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
does,
then
he
has
a
right
to
stand
on
that,
which
i
think
--
i
think
it's
my
right
to
go
there
and
you
can't
bother
me
of
with
something
less
just
as
good.
i
don't
think
it's
just
as
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
he
has
a
right
to
take
that
point
and
this
is
far
from
taking
it
by
saying,
"oh
well,
you
could
have
got
yourself
there
when
you
could
have
had
no
counsel.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
rosenberg,
i
know
that
your
witness
as
if
--
you
might
hurry
turning
of
the
pages.
i
notice
that
--
that
some
of
the
testimony
there's
an
appended
to
the
meaning
to
which
it
reaches
and
sent
his
man
to
which
i'm
concerned
to
an
executive
committee
meeting
of
the
communist
party.
now,
i
can
take
the
judicial
notice
of
the
proceedings
before
this
court
and
of
other
courts,
so
of
federal
courts.
we
know
that
that
issue
was
strongly
contested
what
the
meaning
of
its
meeting
was,
whether
collaboration
at
that
time
meant
they
were
or
weren't
members
of
the
party
etcetera,
etcetera.
and
you
and
i
ought
not
to
know
what
that
cause
of
proceeding
was
and
what's
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
that
there
had
been,
and
why
should
i
think
that
this
kind
of
testimony,
one-sided
testimony
has
anymore
convincing
then
than
the
elaborate
trial
that
it
was
had,
distinguished
in
that
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
addressing
myself
to
the
--
to
the
value
of
the
error
into
such.
what
the
question
--
what
the
case
really
is
the
fairness
of
a
procedure
which
in
evident
brings
out
testimony
like
this
which
are
not
the
advantages
of
thorough
cross-examination.
we
know
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
abolished
the
conjunctions
of
labor
people
in
good
parlance
because
of
the
unreliability
of
affidavit
and
depositions
of
the
basis
of
reaching
the
legal
conclusions
the
theories
enforce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
whether
the
client
should
presumably
know
most
about
it,
this
next
to
his
lawyer
and
--
and
this
would
serve
indictment.
