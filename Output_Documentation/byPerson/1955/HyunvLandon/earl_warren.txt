chief
justice
earl

how
do
you
--
how
do
you
pronounce
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
hyun.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murrish,
why,
if
--
if
you
know,
did
not,
the
government,
take
the
main
hearing
of
this
case
to
hawaii?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
just
going
to
ask
if
you
conceded
that
--
that
he
could
have
had
his
hearing
--
his
entire
hearing
in
hawaii.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
may
i
--
may
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
add
just
one
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
doesn't
exactly
answer
my
question.
it
is
and
where
the
vice
lies,
the
question
is,
could
he,
if
he
had
wanted,
have
had
his
hearing
in
hawaii
where
the
only
substantial
evidence
in
his
case
was
introduced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
government
had
transferred
the
case
there,
he
would
have
been
there,
would
he
not?he
was
in
custody.they
would
have
given
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
taken
him
there
but
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
protested
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
murrish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murrish,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
rosenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
ms.
rosenberg,
is
there
anything
in
the
statutes
or
the
regulations
which
would
prevent
the
government
from
moving
a
deportation
proceeding
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
over
the
objection
of
the
deportee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they,
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
in
san
francisco
and
then
at
the
--
when
the
government
moved
to
new
york
and
then
if
they
wanted
to
move
to
new
orleans
or
some
other
place
over
the
objection
of
the
deportee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
meant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
just
asked
if
there's
anything
in
the
statute
or
the
regulation.
if
there
isn't
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
serious
issue
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
at
what
stage
of
the
proceeding,
ms.
rosenberg,
did
he
first
raise
that
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
depositions
were
paid.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murrish,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
agree
with
ms.
rosenberg,
that
the
government
did
not
have
the
authority
to
bring
witnesses
by
a
subpoena
in
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
from
honolulu
to
los
angeles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask?
would
you
contend,
mr.
murrish
that
your
client
was
not
at
these
meetings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
what
i
--
what
i
was
trying
to
do
would
just
separate
the
two
issues
as
to
whether
--
whether
it
is
just
a
constitutional
issue
that
we
have
here
or
we
--
whether
we
have
also
a
factual
issue
as
to
whether
he
was
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
person
who
was
identified
there
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
we're
--
when
we're
dealing
with
the
situation
to
determine
whether
there's
a
fair
plan,
now
it's
--
it's
--
to
me,
it
would
be
a
very
important
thing
if
there
was
a
serious
contention
that
he
was
not
the
person
who
was
identified
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
