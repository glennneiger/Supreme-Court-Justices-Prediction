m.
harlan
wasn't

some
reason
which
--

you
arguing
that

the

is
a
requirement
in

or
something
sure
to
that.

and
a
crime
of
a

john
m.
harlan
and
you
do
say
that
the
criminal
rule
should
be

m.
harlan
i
leave
that
up.

when
the
notice
of
depositions
was
--
when
depositions
were
first
brought
up?
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly
what
happened?
you
said
he
was
given
notice
of
the
time
and
place
that
was
--
did
he
ask
the
government
to
pay
his
expense?
did
he
say
he
wanted
to
go
over
there?
what
was
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
he
got
--
what
did
he
gone
up
to
that
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
murrish,
up
to
this
point

the
request
that
he
be
taken
or

hearing
then.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
you
could
put
it
out
to
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
it
the
government's
--
was
it
the
government's
motion
in
this
earlier
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
possible
to
say
from
anything
in
this
other
record
that
except
for
that
objection,
the
proceeding
would
have
gone
to
hawaii?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
minutes
of
the
deposition
were
given
to
counsel
to
the
other
side.
did
he
make
the
request
that
he
be
permitted
to
go
over
and
cross-examine
or
they'd
be
brought
over
here
as
if
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
said
that.
