justice
tom
c.
clark
has
very
often,
the
priority
in
these
decisions,
wasn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
that
the
long
absence
in
the
original
hearing
before
the
examining
officer?
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
you
ever
answers
in
hearing
be
transferred
over
to
hawaii
in
the
term
itself
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
of
these
proceedings?
justice
tom
c.
clark
originally,
well,
as
i
understand
you
correctly
on
this
(inaudible)
they
filed
deportation
proceeding
under
1917
act
and
they
then
wanted
to
--
to
rather
pay
the
motion
in
that
case
to
transfer
to
hawaii
and
the
petitioner
objected
to
that.
then
in
that
same
proceeding,
after
the
1950
act,
they
amended
that
proceeding,
constituted
the
proceeding
under
--
under
the
1950
act,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
when
the
first
proceeding
was
recently
instituted,
the
1950
act
had
not
become
effective
or
has
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
second
proceeding
was
merely,
i
suppose,
the
government
in
claiming
its
rights
under
the
1950
act
has
been
--
it
applied
to
the
deportee,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
had
the
same
counsel
to
approve
these
cases
did
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
your
point,
as
i
understood
you
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
all
the
hearings
have
the
same
proceedings
(inaudible)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
where
the
government
would
transfer?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
referring
to
--
all
i
find
in
the
record
was,
first,
the
warrant
of
arrest
provision
in
1949.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
was
beyond
the
prior
act.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
do
you
have
examiner
that
was
part
of
the
--
the
immigration
service,
he
has
hearing,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
so,
he
came
along
and
decided
in
here
that
they're
not
proper,
i
assume.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
you
didn't
issue
a
new
warrant
at
that
time
did
you,
you
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
in
october,
1950,
october.
justice
tom
c.
clark
when
did
you
make
the
notion
to
transfer
it
in
hawaii
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
it's
been
transferred
to
hawaii,
would
they
practice
in
the
department
questions
to
that
held
that
came
into
proceeding
there
he
was
at
new
arrest
warrant?
justice
tom
c.
clark
when
he
objected
--
when
he
objected
though,
he
didn't
transfer.
