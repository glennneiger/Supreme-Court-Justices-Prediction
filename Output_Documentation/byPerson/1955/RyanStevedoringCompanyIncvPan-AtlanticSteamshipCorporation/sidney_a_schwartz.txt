mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
if
your
honor
wishes
me
to
start?
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
ryan
stevedoring
co.,
inc.,
has
been
granted
a
rehearing.
this
court
originally
heard
this
matter
in
march
of
this
year
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
the
court
below
being
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
was
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court,
mr.
justice
harlan
not
being
a
member
of
the
court
at
that
time.
upon
reargument
having
been
granted
in
this
case,
the
same
questions
and
the
same
briefs
are
presented
to
this
court
at
this
time
as
were
before
the
court
in
march
of
this
year
and
the
facts
which
are
projected
for
this
court's
determinations
are
briefly
as
follows.
on
july
20,
1949,
frank
palazzolo
was
a
longshoreman
employed
by
the
petitioner
ryan
stevedoring
company.
and
he
was
injured
on
board
a
certain
vessel
known
as
the
ss.
canton
victory
which
at
the
time
of
his
injury
was
lying
in
navigable
waters
in
brooklyn,
new
york
and
the
canton
victory
was
owned
or
at
least
was
operated,
managed
and
been
controlled
by
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
he
was
injured
when
a
roll
of
paper
pulp,
which
your
honors
may
have
seen
carried
on
newspaper
trucks
in
the
city,
jumped
out
of
a
bottom
tier
in
a
certain
hatch
or
a
hold
which
was
known
as
number
three
and
crossed
his
leg
and
he
sustained
severe
injuries.
to
recover
pecuniary
damages,
mr.
palazzolo
instituted
an
action
in
the
state
supreme
court
in
brooklyn
and
that
action
was
brought
against
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
in
which
action
and
in
which
complaint,
mr.
palazzolo,
the
injured
longshoreman
alleged
that
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
was
negligent
in
the
manner
in
which
it
had
loaded
and
had
permitted
and
suffered
a
certain
stow
to
be
loaded
upon
its
vessel
at
charleston,
south
carolina.
now,
that
stow
and
particularly
hold
number
3
had
been
made
by
ryan
stevedoring
company
at
charleston,
south
carolina.
and
i
respectfully
say
to
this
court
and
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
at
all
times
the
cargo
mate
who
was
an
employee
of
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation,
was
in
actual
control
and
supervision
of
the
manner
in
which
the
cargo
was
still
in
this
particular
hold.
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
when
it
was
sued
in
the
state
court
removed
the
action
to
the
federal
court.
and
after
the
action
had
been
removed,
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
by
a
third-party
complaint
impleaded
ryan
stevedoring
company,
the
employer
of
the
injured
longshoreman.
and
at
this
point
and
at
the
very
outset,
i
would
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
crux
of
the
third-party
complaint
of
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
against
ryan
stevedoring
company,
which
is
found
at
page
12
of
the
record.
paragraph
10th
of
the
third-party
complaint
says,
“the
plaintiff
in
his
complaint
has
alleged
that
a
pile
of
rolls
of
pulp
collapsed
as
a
result
of
which
one
of
them
fell
upon
the
plaintiff
causing
him
to
sustain
severe
and
permanent
injuries.
it
is
further
alleged
that
the
defendants,
their
officers,
crews,
agents,
servants
and
employees
caused,
suffered
and
permitted
the
rolls
of
pulp
to
be
loaded
and
transported
in
a
reckless,
careless
and
negligent
manner
without
being
properly
tiered,
piled
and
secured.
as
a
result
of
which
one
of
the
said
piled
was
cause
to
collapse
and
to
strike
the
plaintiff.”
the
plaintiff
in
his
complaint
further
alleges
that
he
was
not
furnished
with
a
seaworthy
vessel
and
this
is
the
complaint
that
pan-atlantic
makes
against
ryan
stevedoring
company,
the
employer
of
the
injured
man.
the
loading
of
the
rolled
of
paper
pulp
was
performed
by
the
third-party
defendant,
ryan
stevedoring
co.,
inc.,
and
at
the
time,
the
ss.
canton
victory
was
turned
over
to
the
third-party
defendant,
ryan
stevedoring
co.,
inc.,
said
vessel
was
in
a
seaworthy
condition.
if
the
rolls
of
pulp
were
loaded
improperly
or
in
a
negligent
manner
without
being
properly
tiered,
piled
and
secured
and
if
the
ss.
canton
victory
at
the
times
mentioned
in
the
complaint
was
thus
rendered
unseaworthy,
such
unseaworthiness
was
caused
and
created
solely
to
the
conduct,
negligence,
carelessness
and
recklessness
of
the
third-party
defendant,
ryan
stevedoring
co.,
inc.,
its
agents,
servants
and/or
employees
in
the
manner
in
which
they
performed
the
aforesaid
work
and
in
their
failure
to
make
proper
preparation
and
to
take
proper
precautions
in
the
carrying
out
of
the
aforesaid
work.
now,
the
action
came
on
to
the
trial
before
chief
judge
inch
of
the
united
states
district
courts
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
and
it
was
stipulated
at
the
very
outset
of
the
trial
that
the
right
of
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
to
recover
over
as
against
ryan
stevedoring
company
would
be
reasserted
on
the
facts
and
the
law
for
the
trial
court.
but
that
all
evidence
would
be
adduced
at
one
time
and
the
case
which
was
originally
triable
by
jury
would
go
to
the
jury
only
for
its
determination
as
to
whether
the
injured
longshoreman
was
entitled
to
recover
as
against
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
and
so
the
action
was
tried
and
the
action
went
to
the
jury
for
its
resolution
solely
against
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
and
on
this
proposition.
one,
was
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
negligent?
and
two,
was
the
vessel
that
it
operated,
managed
and
controlled
unseaworthy?
the
jury
brought
back
a
general
verdict
in
the
amount
of
$75,000
against
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
and
after
that
verdict
has
been
rendered,
chief
judge
inch
upon
the
submission
of
the
entire
record
to
him
and
upon
the
submission
of
briefs,
determined
the
right
over
and
he
denied
a
right
over
in
favor
of
pan-atlantic
against
ryan
stevedoring
company
in
an
opinion
which
your
--
your
honors
will
find
at
pages
316
through
319.
and
the
crux
of
judge
inch's
findings,
which
dictated
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
as
the
trial
of
the
facts,
no
right
of
indemnity
in
favor
of
pan-atlantic,
is
found
at
pages
318
and
319
of
the
record.
and
there
extensively,
judge
inch
refers
to
the
uncontradicted
testimony
which
was
elicited
from
the
cargo
mate,
in
which
he
had
testified
that
he
was
in
overall
supervision
and
control
of
the
loading
of
the
vessel
at
the
port
at
charleston,
south
carolina
and
he
was
in
overall
supervision
and
control
of
the
discharging
operation
here
in
brooklyn,
new
york.
i
might
indicate
to
the
court
that
he
testified
time
and
time
again
that
he
was
in
the
hold
at
the
time
of
the
loading
of
hold
number
three
and
that
he
actually
saw
the
bottom
tier
from
which
this
one
pile
--
one
roll
came
out
and
injured
the
plaintiff
being
stowed
and
that
it
was
stowed
to
his
entire
satisfaction,
if
it
had
not
been,
he
would
have
complained
and
would
have
seen
that
the
work
should
be
stopped.
in
addition
to
that,
the
proof
shows
that
this
cargo
mate
was
in
the
hold
at
the
very
time
of
the
happening
of
the
accident
here
in
brooklyn
and
that
he
was
in
there
for
5
to
10
minutes
and
had
seen
the
actual
stevedoring
operation
going
on
and
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
everything
that
ryan
had
done
was
done
properly
to
his
satisfaction.
and
judge
inch
denied
a
right
over
and
he
said
in
his
opinion,
in
view
of
this
testimony
which
he
outlined
at
length
dealing
with
what
the
cargo
mate
had
testified
to,
“it
is
plain
that
pan-atlantic's
cargo
officer
did
not
perform
his
admitted
duty
to
supervise
the
safe
and
careful
loading
of
the
vessel.”
now,
i
should
indicate
at
this
time
that
there
was
a
question
of
law
raised
before
the
trial
court
which
he
did
not
decide
and
that
was
whether
the
statute
which
we
had
invoked,
the
u.s.
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
and
specifically
section
5
of
the
act
whether
that
was
a
bar
to
any
claim
of
indemnity
implied
in
law
and
i
should
indicate
also
at
this
time
that
this
case
presents
a
question
of
indemnity
implied
in
law
amongst
other
questions,
there
being
no
express
contract
of
indemnity
between
the
third-party
plaintiff
and
the
third-party
defendant.
there
is
simply
a
contractual
arrangement
which
was
evidenced
by
letters
that
ryan
stevedoring
company
for
an
agreed
price
with
stevedore,
the
vessels
of
the
pan-atlantic
at
the
various
ports
in
the
united
states.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
he
found
them
to
be
joint
tortfeasor,
your
honor.
and
as
i
understand
that
term
and
as
i
understand
judge
inch's
decision,
he
found
that
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
had
been
held
negligent
by
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
cargo
mate's
testimony
as
to
his
control
of
the
situation,
having
been
loaded
to
his
satisfaction
which
the
jury
didn't
find
to
be
satisfactory
and
he
also
found
that
ryan
stevedoring
company
was
negligent
also
so
that
both
of
them
actively
and
affirmatively
participated
in
bringing
the
injury
to
palazzolo.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
say
that
that
is
the
third
question
presented,
judge
inch
having
determined
as
a
question
of
fact
that
both
of
them
had
affirmatively
contributed
to
the
accident.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
when
it
reversed
--
reversed
and
went
beyond
the
scope
of
review
under
the
mcallister
case.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
i
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
could
--
i
could
say
that
all
the
questions
that
the
united
states
can
throw
it
with
are
academic
if
your
honors
reached
the
point
of
findings
of
fact
contained
in
judge
inch's
opinion
as
reversed
by
the
circuit
court.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor,
because
that's
a
factual
question.
i
think
if
your
honor
--
if
your
honors
get
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
maybe
true,
your
honor,
but
as
i
thought
the
logical
presentation,
the
first
questions
for
the
court
was,
does
the
statute
mean
what
it
says
and
if
it
does
you
don't
reach
the
factual
the
question
as
to
whether
on
this
record
there's
indemnity
over
or
not.
and
that
--
that's
the
question
--
that
was
the
first
question
presented
by
the
petitioner
in
its
petition
for
a
writ.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
your
honor,
may
not
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
i
think
this,
your
honor,
and
i
say
this
in
all
fairness
to
the
court.
i
think
the
first
question
that's
presented
by
the
petitioner
which
is
the
first
point
is
a
question
that's
crying
for
determination
in
view
of
the
many
cases
that
are
pending
not
only
in
new
york
but
all
over
the
country
dealing
with
this
very
question
and
all
courts
have
rested
with
it,
is
the
statute
a
complete
bar
or
isn't
it?
and
as
--
as
i
outlined
in
point
one
of
our
brief,
the
decisions
or
at
least
the
various
holdings
and
dictum
of
the
court
of
appeals
writing
through
judge
learned
hand
who
was
chief
judge
at
the
time
that
he
wrote
the
opinion
indicate
that
our
position
is
the
tenable
one,
namely,
that
--
that
the
statute
that
has
here
been
invoked
by
the
petitioner
means
exactly
what
it
says
that
it's
its
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
i
think
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
now,
going
--
going
to
the
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
it's
on
both,
your
honor.
both
court's
have
so
held,
the
district
court
have
--
has
held
that
pan-atlantic
has
been
liable,
has
been
held
liable
here
for
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
writing
through
judge
frank
has
said
and
i
--
i
respectfully
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
now,
the
--
the
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
in
part
that
the
--
the
question
of
comparative
negligence
has
really
been
referred
to
plaintiff
and
defendant.
and
here
we
have
what
the
case
is
perhaps
in
imprecise
terms
have
referred,
at
least
we
characterized
it
so
in
new
york,
as
active
and
passive
negligence.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
by
characterizing
in
a
joint
tortfeasor,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
might
indicate
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
burton's
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
i'm
referring
at
page
326
stamped,
326
of
the
record,
judgment
on
the
action
for
indemnity
over
was
awarded
to
ryan.
we
think
this
error,
the
trial
court
found
pan-atlantic
guilty
of
negligence
and
that
its
cargo
officer
did
not
properly
perform
his
admitted
duty
to
supervise
the
safe
and
careful
loading
of
the
vessel.
and
then
up
above
at
the
very
outset,
judge
frank
writing
for
a
unanimous
court
of
appeals
says
there
was
ample
evidence
to
support
a
jury
--
jury
verdict
on
either
or
both
negligence
or
unseaworthiness.
so
that
both
courts,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
both
held
that
the
record
shows
pan-atlantic
to
be
both
negligent
and
to
have
furnished
an
unseaworthy
vessel
and
the
jury
so
determined
as
far
as
pan-atlantic
was
concerned.
now,
the
first
question
as
i
indicated
that
the
petitioner
raises
here,
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
your
honors
will
find
the
wording
of
the
statute
at
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
and
for
practical
purposes,
the
part
of
the
statute
that
is
important
is
the
first
half
of
the
statute
which
reads
as
follows.
exclusiveness
of
liability,
the
liability
of
an
employer
prescribed
in
section
904
--
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
your
honor.
the
liability
of
an
employer
prescribed
in
section
904
of
this
chapter
shall
be
exclusive
and
in
place
of
all
other
liability
of
such
employer
to
the
employee,
his
legal
representative,
husband
or
wife,
parents,
dependents,
next
to
kin
and
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
such
employer
at
law
or
in
admiralty
on
account
of
such
injury
or
death.
and
i
might
indicate
that
the
--
this
very
section
was
recently
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland
in
the
standard
wholesale
phosphate
case.
and
there,
the
court
of
appeals
for
maryland
said,
“we
think
the
appellant,”
and
that
was
the
shipowner
in
that
case,
“fall
squarely
within
the
definition
of
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
such
employer
at
law
or
in
admiralty
on
account
of
such
injury.
it
follows
that
his
right
to
indemnity
or
contribution
is
foreclose
by
the
act
and
hence,
the
employer
cannot
be
impleaded.”
and
i
respect
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that
citation
is
193
maryland.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz

maryland,
starting
at
page
20
and
the
quotation
from
which
i
just
read
is
found
at
page
30.
it's
found,
your
honor,
in
the
reply
briefs
that
the
petitioner
filed
which
is
in
a
yellow-black
to
that
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
and
it's
found
at
pages
two
and
three
of
that
particular
brief
is
also
referred
to
by
citation
without
quotation
in
the
very
main
brief
at
page
17.
i
might
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
the
construction
of
the
statute
when
it
was
presented
to
them
in
this
particular
case
but
by
virtue
of
the
result
that
it
arrived
at
in
granting
indemnity
over
in
favor
of
pan-atlantic
as
against
ryan
and
reversing
judge
inch's
determination,
it
must
be
assumed
that
they
did
not
agree
with
the
petitioner's
contention
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
went
to
the
factual
situation
in
order
to
determine
whether
pan-atlantic
was
right
or
wrong
in
their
position.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
did
and
we
argued
the
very
cases
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
had
preceded
this
palazzolo
case
in
which
judge
hand
--
learned
hand
and
others
had
indicated
in
dictum
or
in
holding
that
the
statute,
which
we
cited
and
comparable
compensation
statutes
reading
as
does
the
longshore
act,
should
be
construed
according
to
their
plain
terms
and
in
one
of
the
cases
so
that
it
cannot
be
--
it
can't
be
argued
that
the
question
of
contribution
in
contrast
to
--
to
indemnity
was
posed.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
record
will
show,
it's
gill
versus
united
states
where
the
record
will
show
in
that
case
that
the
only
thing
that
the
shipowner
sought
there
was
indemnity
and
not
contribution.
and
in
disposing
of
the
petition
there
for
indemnity,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
merely
said
the
dismissal
of
the
cross
libel
against
turner
and
blanchard,
who
in
that
case
was
the
employer
and
who
was
the
respondent
impleaded
which
paid
libellant
under
the
provisions
of
the
longshoreman's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
without
error
33
u.s.c.a.
section
905.
and
then
they
cite
their
own
case,
american
mutual
liability
insurance
company
against
matthews
wherein
i
represented
the
shipowner
and
arguing
for
a
right
of
contribution
and
the
right
of
contribution
was
denied.
and
there,
the
court
of
appeals
in
denying
contribution
said,
“to
impose
a
non-contractural
duty
of
contribution
on
the
employer
is
pro
tanto
to
deprive
him
of
the
immunity
which
the
statute
grants
him
in
exchange
for
his
absolute
though
limited
liability
to
secure
compensation
to
his
employees.”
and
chief
judge
learned
hand
in
a
concurring
opinion
said
that
the
statute
was
a
release
and
he
said
it
in
these
words,
“and
the
reason
why
i
think
it
should
be
so
construe
is
that
it
has
imposed
upon
employers
an
absolute
though
limited
liability
in
exchanged
for
a
release
from
the
preceding
unlimited
liability,
conditional
upon
negligence.”
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
that
maybe
true
except
with
this
qualification,
your
honor.
here
we
have
no
aid,
the
legislative
intent
so
far
as
can
be
disclosed
by
research
and
this
court
has
indicated
where
a
statute
is
clear
and
unambiguous
in
its
language
if
they
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
we
--
we
didn't
get
to
this
anomalous
result,
your
honor,
that
in
this
particular
case
where
we
have
concurrent
negligence
not
only
as
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
had
been
held
liable
for
negligence
but
also
ryan.
we
have
the
anomalous
result
in
construction
of
a
statute
where,
by
virtue
of
that
concurrent
negligence,
ryan
stevedoring
company
now
has
an
unlimited
liability
in
this
case
$75,000
and
whereas
if
they
were
solely
negligent
in
contrast
to
being
negligent
with
someone
else.
this
man
would
have
been
relegated
to
compensation
where
the
maximum
liability
under
the
compensation
statute
would
have
been
$11,000.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
it's
not
exactly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
i
should
tell
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
their
--
their
--
the
stocks
are
owned
by
waterman
steamship
corporation
but
i
should
indicate
this
to
your
honor,
there
is
an
insurer
of
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
there
is
another
insurer
of
ryan
stevedoring
company.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
argue
outside
of
the
record
but
it's
in
the
briefs
because
it
was
post
in
my
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
by
--
for
a
practical
result
and
maybe
that
all
of
them
will
decide
to
place
their
insurance
in
one
company
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
for
a
decision
here.
i
think
here,
we
have
a
case
where
there
is
$25,000
coverage
for
ryan
stevedoring
company
on
the
claim
over
now
and
the
judgment
over
of
$75,000,
so
that
ryan
stevedoring
company
had
an
uninsured
liability
of
$50,000,
which
they
must
pay
to
waterman's
insurer,
not
to
waterman
but
to
waterman's
insurer.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
right,
i'm
contending
for
the
construction
of
the
statutes
so
that
an
employee
now
as
has
been
done
in
this
case
cannot,
by
bringing
an
action
against
a
shipowner,
really
recover
from
his
employer
because
the
shipowner
really
becomes
a
conduit
who
in
turn
pays
the
employer's
money
over
to
the
injured
longshoreman,
a
liability
beyond
what
the
statute
contemplated
to
be
the
liability
of
the
employer
if
it
was
solely
negligent.
now,
here
we
come
off
with
a
worst
deal,
here
we're
as
negligent
as
the
shipowner
and
here
we
have
a
liability
of
$75,000
in
contrast
to
what
would
have
been
our
liability
was
--
was
that
simply
our
own
negligence
which
caused
the
result.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
arrived
at
an
anomalous
situation
as
far
as
dollars
and
cents
is
concerned
when
we
talk
about
approximate
cause
and
when
we
talk
about
the
legalistic
behind
this
situation.
now,
in
so
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
the
cases
so
hold.
but
the
cases
never
have
granted
a
recovery
over
in
a
situation
of
a
claim
made
as
has
been
made
here,
where
the
trier
of
the
facts
does
not
look
at
the
relative
delinquencies
of
the
parties.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
trier
of
the
facts
was
the
trial
court
sitting
without
a
jury.
he
determined
that
the
parties
had
actively
and
affirmatively
participated
in
the
in
the
tort.
therefore,
merely
because
we
owed
a
duty
to
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation,
the
stevedore,
their
vessel
properly
despite
the
fact
that
their
own
cargo
mate
and
their
own
expert
was
in
actual
supervision
and
control
throughout
by
his
uncontradicted
testimony.
here,
we
shouldn't,
without
looking
at
the
qualities
of
the
torts
of
these
particular
parties,
be
called
upon
to
pay
them
when
they
stood
by
through
there
own
supervising
officer
and
said
in
essence,
“i
see
how
you
are
loading
this
ship.
its
perfectly
all
right
as
i
see
you
loading
it
now.
but
if
it
should
be
determined
hereafter
that
someone
says
that
this
ship
was
loaded
improperly
then
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i'm
entitled
to
indemnity
from
you
and
i'm
going
to
pull
my
hands
and
not
stop
you
from
doing
what
you're
doing
even
though
i
think
its
proper.”
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
well,
as
your
honors
see,
these
intwine
themselves
one
with
the
other.
the
second
point
is
a
point
that
deals
with
a
question
which
maybe
an
academic
question
depending
upon
what
your
honors
do
with
what
i
assumed
in
logical
presentation
was
the
first
point,
namely,
the
statute
and
that
is
whether
under
the
general
maritime
law
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
halcyon
case
where
you
said
that
there
is
no
contribution
between
joint
tortfeasor
whether
there
exist
a
right
of
indemnity
under
the
general
maritime
law
in
view
of
the
fact
that
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
erie
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
said
that
indemnity
--
no,
that
contribution
is
partial
indemnity
and
where
other
courts
have
said
that
indemnity
is
only
an
extreme
form
of
contribution.
now,
unless
these
are
just
empty
words,
we
have
a
situation
where
this
court
in
halcyon
case,
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
has
said
that
there
is
no
contribution
between
joint
tortfeasor.
if
that
be
--
be
true
and
there
is
no
legal
distinction
between
indemnity
and
contributions
then
it
should
naturally
follow
that
there
should
be
no
indemnity
between
joint
tortfeasor.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
the
trial
court
would
still
have
to
look
at
the
testimony
that
had
been
adduced
in
the
case.
and
that
testimony
from
the
cargo
mate
where
he
had
testified
as
to
his
overall
supervision
and
control
and
--
and
what
he
saw
at
the
point
of
loading
and
at
the
point
of
discharge
and
still
he
would
have
to
--
the
trial
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
relative
delinquency
even
though
the
jury's
verdict
was
predicated
solely
on
unseaworthiness
because
the
best
that
you
can
get
out
of
an
unseaworthy
condition
is
that
there
was
a
defective
condition
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
known
to
the
shipowner
or
not.
but
in
order
to
determine
the
question
of
indemnity
over,
the
trial
court
would
have
to
take
the
whole
record
into
account
and
he
would
be
confronted
as
he
was
here
with
the
cargo
mate's
testimony.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
when
you
say
no
negligence,
your
honor
means
that
they
are
limited
solely
to
unseaworthiness?
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
and
then
they
--
then
they
find
that
there's
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
then
i
think
the
trial
court
might
be
bound
and
there
would
be
a
right
of
indemnity
over
because
there
he
would
be
bound
by
the
finding
made
by
jury
that
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
had
not
been
negligent.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
say
if
you
don't
get
to
the
--
i
meant
to
say,
if
you
don't
get
to
the
statute.
my
--
my
argument
on
the
statute
is
you'll
never
get
to
the
other
questions
unless
you
hold
that
the
statute
does
not
mean
what
it
said.
if
your
honors
come
to
that
conclusion
that
it
is
not
an
exclusive
liability
insofar
as
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
is
concerned
because
they
are
not
embraced
by
the
word
anyone
otherwise
entitled,
then
you
get
to
the
other
questions.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
i
--
i'm
trying
to
think,
if
your
honor's
determined
--
if
your
honor
determined
that
--
that
the
circuit
court
was
right
in
it's
appraisal
of
the
evidence
insofar
as
the
relative
delinquencies
of
the
parties
is
concerned,
they
had
a
right
to
reverse
the
trial
court,
then
your
honor's
would
say
the
right
of
indemnity
exists
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
what
would
you
do
with
the
question
of
law?
it'd
have
to
come
to
that
question
then
whether
the
statute
was
still
a
defense
despite
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
if
you
agree
with
judge
hand,
that's
correct,
but
i
assume
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
--
i
assume
the
other
situation.
if
your
honors
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
i
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
as
i
--
as
i
attempted
to
indicated
to
your
honor
that
as
i
saw
the
logical
presentation
of
this,
if
your
honors
got
to
review
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
namely,
that
the
fact
show
that
they
should
be
indemnity
over,
you'd
still
have
before
you
the
question
of
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
so
that
in
order
to
eliminate
the
question
entirely,
i
assumed
that
logically
the
question
of
the
construction
on
the
statute
should
come
first.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
dollar
wise
we'd
came
out
all
right,
but
i
don't
know
that
that's
the
solutions
to
the
entire
problem,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
it's
not
an
abstract
question,
your
honor.
i
--
i
--
for
one
and
i'm
just
one
voice
crying
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i'm
not
concerned
about
it,
but
i'd
--
i'd
like
the
question
to
be
answered
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
if
your
honors
don't
agree
with
us
and
pass
to
the
factual
situation
dollar
wise,
i
may
still
come
out
all
right
in
this
case.
but
as
i
say,
there
are
many
cases.
i
have
at
least
17
in
my
office
and
there
are
117
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
i'm
not
arguing
of
a
case.
i
say
the
principle
permeates
all
these
cases,
your
honor.
there
are
--
there
are
117
cases
which
we
presented
in
our
petition
for
rehearing
where
the
parties
are
aligned
as
the
parties
are
here
where
the
same
questions
are
being
urged.
and
i
say
that
simply
in
the
two
districts
in
new
york.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
with
respect
to
rebuttal.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
assume
that
the
thrust
of
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
inquiry
of
counsel
with
respect
to
what
the
compensation
carrier
could
do
is
directed
towards
the
effect
that
the
construction
of
this
statute
will
have
on
the
injured
longshoreman
and
his
ability
hereafter
to
recover
either
compensation
or
damages
in
his
third-party
lawsuit.
now
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
right.
now,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
and
no
provision
of
the
law
and
the
--
particularly
this
statute.
why
if
an
employer
is
exposed
to
being
impleaded
by
the
third
party
who
has
been
sued
by
his
injured
longshoreman,
why
that
employer
or
the
compensation
carrier,
assuming
that
he's
covered
by
a
compensation
carrier,
cannot
controvert
by
filing
a
notice
of
controversy,
the
claim
of
the
longshoreman
for
compensation?
now,
the
only
penalty
that
the
statute
prescribes
is
if
the
controversion
was
not
a
good
one.
and
that
they
controverted
it
without
any
real
ground
that
there
is
a
10%
penalty
that
is
affixed
to
the
award,
so
that
if
the
man
were
entitled
to
$2000
as
compensation,
the
compensation
carrier
would
then
be
liable
for
$2200.
and
that
is
the
only
penalty
that
the
statute
prescribed
in
--
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
controverted
claim.
now,
if
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
that
doesn't
--
i
don't
mean
that
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
if
a
man
is
injured,
in
the
state
of
new
york,
he
has
three
years
to
bring
an
action
in
negligence
as
against
a
third
party.
under
a
recent
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
if
he
predicates
his
right
upon
a
breach
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
as
against
the
shipowner,
they
say
he
has
six
years.
now,
during
that
interim
of
three
years
within
which
he
can
bring
his
lawsuit
or
within
six
years,
depending
upon
the
theory,
that
man
would
be
entitled
to
compensation.
and
the
compensation
carriers
today,
all
of
them
that
i
know
of
have
voluntarily
paid
this
man
compensation
during
either
those
three
years
or
during
the
six
years.
but
the
moment
that
he
files
his
election
to
sue
a
third
party,
the
statue
has
been
construed
to
mean
that
all
compensation
payments
may
then
be
suspended
by
the
compensation
carrier.
so
now,
let's
see
what
they
do
in
mechanics.
a
longshoreman,
having
three
years
to
bring
his
action
as
against
the
third
party,
takes
compensation
voluntarily
given
to
him
by
the
compensation
carrier
prior
to,
just
shortly
before
that
three
years
expires,
he
then
brings
his
action
against
the
third
party.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that
is
the
normal
course
of
all
these
proceedings.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
right
and
some
of
them
don't
even
file
their
notice
of
election
to
sue
a
third
party
so
that
the
compensation
carrier
won't
know
that
they
have
a
third-party
action
going
because
once
the
third-party
action
has
commenced,
payments
under
the
act
can
be
suspended
and
compensation
carriers
do.
and
that
what
was
done
in
this
case.
there
was
some
indication.
i
think
your
honor
used
the
word
"financing
the
lawsuit."
we
didn't
finance
this
lawsuit
at
all.
when
this
man
instituted
his
third
party
action
against
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation,
we
stopped
paying
compensation
as
we
were
entitled
to
do
under
the
statute.
compensation
at
that
time
had
run
to
approximately
$2
thousand
odd.
also,
we
had
paid
medical
expenses
roughly
$10,000
so
that
at
that
time,
at
the
institution
of
his
third-party
action,
we
had
paid
benefits
of
approximately
$13,000.
now,
if
we
have
this
open-ended
liability
on
an
impleaded
situation
and
ryan
is
indeed
lucky
in
this
case
because
in
contrast
to
most
stevedoring
companies
who
have
no
1b
coverage
and
i'll
indicate
to
the
court
how
that
works.
ryan
in
this
case
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
$25,000
coverage
but
in
dollars
and
cents
to
ryan
it
means
that
if
this
recovery
over
is
against
them,
which
now
is
approximately
$80
odd
thousand
with
interest
and
--
and
cost
is
to
stand
ryan's
compensation
carrier
because
they
have
a
1b
coverage
on
their
workmen's
compensation
policy,
we'll
pay
$25,000.
ryan,
out
of
their
own
pocket,
will
have
to
pay
some
$50
or
$60
odd
thousand
to
the
insurer
of
the
steamship
company
because
there
the
construction
of
the
statute
has
gone
against
him.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
at
--
at
prohibited
rates
if
they
can
get
it
if
their
experience
is
good
enough.
lots
of
insurance
companies
won't
write
this
coverage
because
of
the
hazardous
industry
that
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
of
accident.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
and
on
the
part
of
the
shipowners
in
which
they
--
they
have
this
situation
where
there
is
a
concurrent
negligence
and
where
they
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
--
can
be
impleaded.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
retrospective?
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
right.
i
would
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
as
i
intended
to
indicate
to
the
court,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
your
question
on
the
assumption
that
their
compliance
with
the
statute
exonerated
them
from
all
further
exposure
and
accidents
of
this
kind,
most
insurance
companies
don't
have
this
coverage.
i
for
one
have
two
--
two
stevedoring
companies
in
my
office
who
don't
have
any
coverage.
so
that
when
they
are
impleaded
in
a
lawsuit
in
the
same
situation
that
we
find
ourselves
now
where
an
employee
sues
a
shipowner
and
then
they
--
there's
a
claim
over
for
indemnity
implied
in
law,
they
will
have
to
come
out
of
there
pocket
because
they
don't
have
any
insurance,
they
didn't
think
they
needed
it.
they
construed
this
statute
as
other
courts
have
construed
the
statute.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
some
of
them
do.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that
is
correct.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
when
you
say
the
careful
ones,
they
got
the
normal
coverage
under
1b
that
they
could've
got
as
a
matter
of
cause.
and
they
--
they
didn't
assume
that
they'd
have
this
opened-ended
liability
but
the
reason
--
the
reason
1b
was
taken
out,
your
honor,
is
because
under
some
circumstances
certain
employees
yet
could
still
sue
their
employer,
could
stand
--
and
that's
sounds
funny.
now,
you
have
--
you
have
the
question
of
a
man
on
barges,
non-self
--
self
propelled
barges.
are
they
under
the
longshoremen's
act
or
are
they
crewmen
under
the
jones
act?
nobody
knows
definitely.
so
in
order
to
cover
that
situation,
they
get
a
$25,000
endorsement
under
1b
so
that
if
a
barge
captain
had
sue
them,
acclaiming
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
or
a
seaman
and
entitled
to
bring
suit
under
the
jones
act,
that
1b
coverage
would
pick
up
that
kind
of
a
situation
but
that's
why
they
buy
it
with
that
purpose
in
mind
in
connection
with
that
type
of
employee.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
then
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
but
then
i
say
to
your
honor
that
we,
as
the
petitioner
here,
with
this
statute
by
many
courts
having
been
held
to
be
clear
and
unambiguous
and
if
we
assume
that
that
is
so
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
you
have
the
other
judges
that
have
gone
the
other
way
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
there
are
two
judges
in
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
and
unambiguous.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
in
my
say
--
in
my
favor
(inaudible)
against
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
one
case
is
(inaudible)
against
mccain
inc
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
federal
supplement
553.
another
case
is
coates
against
potomac
electric
power
company
95
federal
supplement
779,
subsequent
opinion
in
96
federal
supplement
1019.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
the
same
story
of
the
--
a
court
having
decided
before
a
proposition
or
having
spoken
on
the
subject.
when
confronted
again
have
the
unhappy
choice
of
saying,
shall
we
retract
what
we
said
before
or
shall
we
not
cover
the
point.
now,
i
think
that
as
my
brief
shows
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
before
this
case,
in
three
cases,
american
mutual
against
matthews,
gill
against
united
states,
and
mikkelsen
against
s.s.granville,
all
cited
in
my
brief,
have
held
this
statute
to
be
a
complete
law
in
connection
with
a
claim
for
contribution
or
for
indemnity.
now,
they
never
referred
in
their
opinion,
their
opinion
is
entirely
silent
as
to
the
statute.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no
questions
about
it,
your
honor.
i
say
that
they
never
could
have
reached
the
result
that
they
arrived
at
if
they
had
agreed
with
the
petitioner's
contention,
no
question
about
that.
but
they
have
said
nothing
about
the
construction
of
the
statute,
haven't
even
said
in
disposing
of
it
that
it
was
raised
and
we
decide
against
the
petitioner.
the
opinion
is
completely
silent,
that's
all
i
say.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
draw
the
inference
that
they
disagree
with
the
petitioner,
obviously,
otherwise
they
never
would
have
gotten
to
the
factual
question.
and
that's
why
i
present
to
this
court
as
a
question
of
logical
sequence
or
at
least
i
thought
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
that
the
statute
construction
is
a
question
of
law.
if
the
statute
is
construed
as
we
contend
for
then
you'll
never
get
to
the
facts,
you'll
never
get
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
construction
of
this
statute
and
whether
it
takes
money
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
employer
and
really
serves
as
a
conduit
to
give
it
to
his
employee.
i
would
like
to
just
indicate
to
the
court
and
its
found
at
page
20
of
the
petitioner's
main
brief
that
the
third
circuit,
when
dealing
with
this
problem,
in
the
case
of
the
baccile
against
halcyon
which
was
reversed
under
the
name
of
halcyon
against
haenn
on
another
proposition
said
nevertheless
the
device
of
the
act,
dealing
with
this
longshore
statute,
must
be
frustrated
if
the
negligent
employer
is
subject
to
full
contribution
for
then
the
third
party,
that's
the
shipowner,
is
merely
the
conduit
between
employer
and
employee
for
the
transfer
of
damages
in
excess
of
compensation.
now,
let's
see
too
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
maryland
in
the
case
of
standard
wholesale
said
and
there
your
honors
will
find
the
quotation
from
which
i
read
at
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
to
that
of
the
government.
and
there,
the
court
of
appeals
for
maryland
in
dealing
with
this
very
statute
and
in
dismissing
and
affirming
the
dismissal
of
the
third-party
complaint
said
this,
in
the
absence
of
waiver,
now
obviously
that
must
mean
by
contract
or
something
by
which
the
employer
divest
himself
of
the
immunity
of
the
statute
which
we
contend
for,
the
employer's
conformance
with
the
statute
by
providing
compensation
in
all
cases
regardless
of
fault
prevents
recovery
against
him
on
the
ground
of
negligence.
the
statute
declares
his
liability
for
compensation
to
be
exclusive
if
it
should
be
construed
to
preserve
his
liability
for
the
payment
of
a
sum
measured
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
damages
sustained
by
the
employee
merely
because
the
negligence
of
a
third
party
concurred
or
is
claimed
to
have
concurred
with
his
own
in
producing
the
injury,
his
liability
for
compensation
would
not
be
exclusive.
it
is
probable
that
his
liability
would
in
most
cases
exceed
the
limits
setup
in
the
statute.
we
think
it
is
immaterial
whether
his
liability
to
a
joint
tortfeasor
stems
from
a
statutory
right
that
contribution
opens
general
principles
of
the
admiralty
law.
in
either
event,
it
is
essentially
a
liability
to
pay
or
share
in
the
payment
of
damages
for
the
injury
to
his
employee
of
which
the
statute
relieves
him.
and
i
say
those
two
cases
dealing
with
this
very
statute
has
set
the
pattern
for
those
particular
courts
of
the
construction
that
should
be
accorded
for
this
statute.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that
at
all.
i
say
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
that's
right.
but
that's
because
the
stevedore
by
his
own
expressed
act
has
waived
the
immunity
of
the
statute
which
he
had
before.
he
set
it
down
in
contract
--
contrary
to
what
the
statute
said.
and
then
i
might
indicate
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
now,
there
--
there
would
we
--
the
contract
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
here
expressed
or
implied
contracts.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
your
honor
said
a
contract
in
fact
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
i
can
best
answer
your
question
this
way,
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
writ
expressed
contract
between
two
people
that
says
that,
"i
will
indemnify
you
for
your
negligence,"
which
could
have
been
done
in
this
case
but
which
was
not
done.
then
i
say
if
that
is
an
unequivocal
hold
harmless
agreement,
i
am
obligated
to
indemnify
you
even
for
your
own
negligence
and
there
are
many
such
contracts
which
have
been
construed
by
this
and
other
courts.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
then
i
say
that
isn't
--
then
you
have
to
get
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
then
i
say
that
isn't
good
enough
to
claim
indemnity.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
shall
indemnify
you
for
your
--
your
negligence?
it
--
it
has
to
--
it
has
to
say
that,
your
honor,
because
these
statutes
have
been
construed.
your
honors
had
my
case
of
american
stevedores
against
porello
several
years
ago,
where
the
question
there
was
whether
that
contract
between
the
government
and
american
stevedores
was
an
unequivocal
hold
harmless
agreement
so
that
american
stevedores
there
was
obligated
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
indemnify
the
united
states
for
its
own
negligence.
your
honors
decided
that
the
contract
was
ambiguous.
your
honors
remanded
it
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination.
now,
i
say
if
you
have
an
unequivocal
hold
harmless
agreement,
then
you
have
no
problem
as
we
have
here.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no.
i
say
that
--
i
only
cite
that
as
an
example
to
your
honors
that
there
are
contracts
which
attempt
to
cover
the
situation
that
i
assumed
your
honor
was
speaking
of.
those
contracts
sometimes
are
not
clearly
drawn,
they
must
be
construed
then
you
have
the
problem
of
the
construction
of
a
written
contract.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
i
think
your
honor
will
find
the
decisions
and
--
and
the
approach
to
this
problem
still
an
indemnity
situation
which
is
predicated
on
the
quality
of
a
tort
even
though
you
may
have
a
contract
with
me
to
do
a
particular
job
on
your
house.
there
are
cases,
i've
cited
them
in
my
brief
that
when
you
stand
by
or
when
you
discover
the
danger
then
when
you
are
held
liable
to
a
third
party
who
has
come
upon
your
premises
and
you
are
under
a
duty
of
care
to
him,
then
despite
the
fact
that
i
may
have
done
the
work
negligently
and
not
perform
properly
my
contract
with
your
honor
to
do
the
work
that
you
contracted
me
for.
nevertheless,
it's
for
the
trier
of
the
facts
to
imply
a
contract
of
indemnity,
because
the
parties
haven't
done
so
by
their
own
expressed
act,
if
your
honor
has
the
claimed
indemnity,
has
not
participated
in
the
tort
to
the
extent
that
your
honor's
negligence
to
the
plaintiff
can
be
found
to
be
active
negligence.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
yes.
and
--
and
there's
another
reason,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
pan-atlantic
steamship
company
wasn't
held
liable
because
our
negligence
was
imputed
to
them,
the
charge
of
judge
inch
to
the
jury,
put
up
to
the
jury
for
determination,
did
pan-atlantic
furnished
proper
appliances?
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
right.
and
on
the
last
proposition
and
that
is
the
third
point
that
the
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well,
i
have
it
in
the
index
here,
your
honor,
without
going
to
the
thing
at
95
federal
supplement
779.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
coates
against
potomac.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
should
indicate
this
in
closing
with
respect
to
an
inquiry
that
was
made
yesterday
accounts
by
mr.
justice
clark.
although
they
may
testify
that
chocks
were
available
at
the
port
of
loading,
all
the
witnesses
of
the
plaintiff,
mr.
palazzolo,
testified
the
pan-atlantic
didn't
use
wedges
or
chocks,
never
believed
in
them.
they
may
testify
in
fact
and
the
references
are
in
the
brief
that
at
the
port
of
loading,
he
saw
this
bottom
tier
which
is
the
tier
involved
in
--
in
this
accident,
chocked.
indeed
he
testified
that
when
he
was
in
the
hold
where
the
accident
occurred
and
by
the
way
this
was
not
a
latent
situation
because
you
have
a
20-foot
square
area
which
is
the
square
of
the
hatch
would
be
roll
of
the
paper
pulp
on
the
side,
clearly
visible
with
whatever
is
underneath
them
that
when
he
was
in
this
hatch
by
the
10
minutes
before
the
accident
occurred
and
throughout
those
five
to
ten
minutes
he
saw
chocks
in
the
bottom
tier
holding
them
in
place.
now,
the
plaintiff's
witnesses
testified
there
were
no
chocks.
they
never
had
been
supplied.
pan-atlantic
didn't
believe
in
them.
the
only
thing
that
had
been
supplied
was
scraps
of
dunnage
which
are
mere
boards
which
had
been
jammed
underneath
the
rolls
to
stop
them
from
rolling
out.
now,
whom
did
the
jury
believe?
obviously,
as
the
cargo
mate's
testimony
been
believed,
they
wouldn't
have
found
that
he
was
--
that
pan-atlantic
was
negligent,
having
found
that
pan-atlantic
was
negligent
inherent
in
the
jury's
verdict
and
so
found
by
the
trial
court
is
the
fact
that
the
shipowner
did
not
furnish
proper
appliances.
now,
if
you
can
say
that
where
a
shipowner
who
was
obligated
as
the
cargo
mate
said
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
ship
to
furnish
the
wedges
and
chocks,
if
you
can
say
that
they,
having
furnished
defective
or
insufficient
appliances,
are
merely
guilty
of
passive
negligence
and
can
get
it
all
over
from
us
then
i
say
that's
profitable
negligence
in
their
favor
because
whatever
they've
been
held
liable
for,
they
recoup
from
us.
well,
we
had
assumed
that
being
under
the
control
and
supervision
of
the
cargo
mate,
having
done
everything
satisfactory
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
with
overall
complete
authority
in
him
to
stop
the
work
anytime
he
was
dissatisfied,
which
he
was
not
dissatisfied
with
that
he
is
negligent.
it
is
certainly
at
best,
akin
to
us
that
we
are
no
worst
than
he
is,
our
qualities
therefore
are
the
same
at
best.
and
if
that
be
true,
we
stand
a
joint
tortfeasor
as
the
district
court
found
which
is
substantiated
by
the
evidence
in
this
record,
which
was
beyond
the
scope
of
review
for
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
only
thing
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
the
character
of
negligence
must
be
different
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
arrive
at
the
result
that
they
did.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
there'd
have
to
be
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
granted
full
indemnity
over
and
reverse
the
trail
court
who
had
found
that
they
were
joint
tortfeasors
because
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
this
--
this
entire
operation
was
a
joint
operation.
and
he
found
them
both
to
be
guilty
of
negligence
with
the
same
quality
of
negligence.
otherwise,
that
he
found
--
that
he
found
there
to
be
merely
passive
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
and
our
--
our
negligence
being
affirmative
and
active
in
being
the
soul
affirmative
negligence,
he
would
have
granted
recovery
over
against
and
he
must
have
under
the
law.
now,
the
only
--
the
only
other
thing
i
would
like
to
add
to
my
presentation
is
that
the
full
argument
of
the
petitioner.
unfortunately,
because
of
the
many
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case
by
various
amici
and
by
the
parties
themselves,
they're
found
in
three
briefs,
the
main
brief,
the
reply
of
the
petitioner
to
that
of
the
respondent
and
the
reply
of
the
petitioner
to
that
of
the
united
states
as
amicus.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
certainly.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
if
your
honors
find
that
there
--
a
right
of
indemnity
exists
in
admiralty
under
the
general
admiralty
law
and
if
the
statute
is
not
a
bar
then
i
say
if
you
determine
that
pan-atlantic
is
passive,
they
would
be
entitled
to
indemnity.
