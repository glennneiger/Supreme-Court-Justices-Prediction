you
--
what
you're
saying
is
they
could
readjust
the
business

the
basis
that
now,
they're
going
to
have
this
liability
which
the
evidence
says
that
they're
going
to
have
to
on
this
substance
that
you
impose
it
and
they
can

and
they
can
readjust

has
been
the
fact

it
been
on
the
basis
that
where
a
stevedoring
company
was
liable
only
for
the
amount
which
the
longshoremen's
act
did
or
that
he
might
be
held
for
liability
such
as

about
the
way

this
statute
clearly
and
unambiguous
to
mean
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
the
stevedoring
company
can
be
made
to
face
somebody
more
than
the
longshoremen's
act
provide?
