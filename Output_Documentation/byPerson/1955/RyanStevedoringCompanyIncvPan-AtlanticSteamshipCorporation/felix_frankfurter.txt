that

sorry,
i
didn't

(inaudible)
i
have
a
general

don't

(inaudible)

they
took
a
different
view
of
the
significance

negligence.
justice

the
quality,
the
next
important
thing
about
comparative
--
the
so-called
comparative
negligence
and
the
relationship
between
two
joint
tortfeasor,
who
aren't
truthfully
liable.
all
right.
justice

isn't
that
true?
justice

but
in

judge

found
active
negligence
on
the

both
the

didn't
he?
justice

suppose

suppose
that

saw
(inaudible)
and
i
suppose
you
don't

(inaudible)

i
can't
imagine
the
words

imaginable
interpretation
of
facts
and
this
court
(inaudible)
again
and
again
(inaudible)
the
statute.
the
statute
is
important,
i'm
not
saying
it
in
closing.
we
do
not
reach
that
--
judge

hand
wisely
would
say
again
and
again
and
again,
it
subside
in
the
word
of
any
and
all
and
every
--
all
of
those
court
words
in
themselves
contains
a
piece
of
ambiguity
(inaudible)
justice

you
said
the
person
can't
get
any
if
he
is
arguing
such
a
case.
(inaudible)
justice

these
are
all
(inaudible)
justice
felix

aren't
they?
justice

(inaudible)
deciding
this
case
except
the
question
of
how
the
insurance
came
to
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
this
is
irrelevant
to
my
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
there
be
a
--
right
of
indemnity
(inaudible)
the
statute.
justice
felix

you
mean,
we
must
stop
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we
must
take
it
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
don't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
--
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
replying
as
to
the
real
abstract
question
of
having
the
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
this
case,
your
concern
is
not
only
committed
--
printed
on
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
were
arguing
another
case
besides
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
before
you
move
on.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
--
that
in
your
experience,
the
employee
invariably
elects
the
cause
against
the
third
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
start
with
those
requisites?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
is
this
usual
here
that
voluntary
payments
are
made
and
accepted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
my
question
was
whether
the
finance
need
of
the
injured
employee
has
to
deal
by
a
district,
his
normal
way
of
financing,
he's
going
to
need
an
ultimate
determination
whether
by
an
award
or
a
third-party
action
because
i
too
instead
of
saying,
ultimately
deciding
it's
not
financed.
i
don't
--
is
that
in
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there'd
been
no
longshoreman's
act,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
does
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
if
he's
too
careless,
he
might
be
--
and
the
fellow
died,
he
might
be
valid
to
manslaughter
as
ultimately
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
that
for
that
reason,
i
was
hoping
employees
had
been
working
for
a
proper
judgment
as
i
construe
it
(inaudible)
if
the
law
says
that
is
either
to
recommend
--
initiate
a
compensation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
not
speculating
or
is
that
the
normal
course
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
nothing
to
prevent
them
or
any
other
stevedore
for
carrying
insurers
and
they
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably,
because
of
these
utterances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
--
of
whatever
you
call
it,
this
conduct
or
adequate
conduct,
in
the
part
of
the
stevedoring
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr,
schwartz,
we
can't
decide
--
construe
the
statutes
(inaudible)
on
the
assumption
as
to
what
was
the
understanding
of
the
stevedoring
industry
of
what
we
have
before
us,
adequate
(inaudible)
negligent
part
of
the
justice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
what
was
the
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
a
legal
advice
saying
--
sought
or
what
kind
of
a
legal
advice
they've
got,
what
kind
of
difficulty
they
put,
two
way
of
determining
of
what's
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
shouldn't
be
so
clear
and
unambiguous
that
we
justified
the
one
here
that
as
clear
and
unambiguous
sort
of
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i'd
say
should
be
either
question.
there's
no
use
of
that
to
me
to
construe
this
statute
on
an
assumption
that
for
20
years
this
statute
has
been
enforced,
every
loyal
that
saw
clearly
the
way
you
argued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
said
it's
clear
and
unambiguous
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
other
way.
what
are
those
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
must
have
been
created
as
a
pre-judge
of
--
they
couldn't
have
advocated
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably,
couldn't
have
decided
what
they
did
if
the
statute
had
barred
recovery,
could
they?
these
aren't
logically
free
lawyers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
inference
you
draw
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
if
there'd
been
an
implicit
agreement
between
(inaudible)
where
and
these
kind
of
facts,
where
under
(inaudible)
to
be
declared
against
public
policy
and
unimportant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
would
--
it
would
put
a
principle
in
case
they
use
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
by
his
own
--
own
act,
is
there
a
contrast
in
facts,
doesn't
deal
whether
the
contract
(inaudible)
words,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
implied
in
the
connection
of
words
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
this
is
for
me
a
very
different
thing
from
imply
because
if
the
court
acknowledges
the
way
imply
is
used
to
this,
he'd
be
required
to
(inaudible)
i'm
not
talking
about
it.
i'm
talking
about
(inaudible)
inceptions
and
inscriptions
from
one
side
to
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
i'm
talking
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there'd
been
say
expressly,
i
will
indemnify
you,
they
say
that
i
am
responsible
for
all
the
damage
i
caused
you
through
my
negligence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
set
up
like
that
in
those
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
says,
"and
i
shall
indemnify
you,
therefore
from
innocence."
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right
in
your
argument
we
should
have
--
it
shouldn't
(inaudible)
itself.
it
was
decided
clearly,
not
unequivocally,
in
as
much
as
there
is
no
explicit
assumption
of
indemnity,
of
course
there
is
no
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
case
--
that
case,
i
do
not
imply
you
think
that
helps
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
contemplate
fitness
of
all
those
words.
words
have
to
be
construed
for
their
(inaudible)
well,
i
say
to
you
i
do
not
see
anything
that
encroach
the
trouble
of
policies
of
the
longshoremen's
act,
will
allow
(inaudible)
it
is
very
clear,
i
shall
indemnify
you
for
what
you
have
to
say
because
of
my
negligence
and
--
and
the
situation
in
which
that
inference,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
can
be
drawn
up
by
a
virtual
transactions
between
the
parties.
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
see
no
difference.
if
you
say
as
you
do,
correct,
this
word
inclusively
and
that
can
be
--
that
can
be
subordinated
when
explicitly
i
see
nothing
improbably
that
prevent
this
from
being
for
me
subordinate
--
subordinated
with
agreement
in
fact
that
doesn't
use
the
magic
word
“indemnity.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
and
i
follow
you
because
in
those
cases,
the
court
say
that
the
damage
didn't
fall
from
you
anymore
that
that
goes
for
me,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
all
that
and
(inaudible)
but
i
suggest
--
suggested
--
anyway,
i
suggest
it
now
that
if
they're
not
clear
review
of
judge
inch's
decision
of
what
the
validity
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did

justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
government
been
sued
for
stevedoring
