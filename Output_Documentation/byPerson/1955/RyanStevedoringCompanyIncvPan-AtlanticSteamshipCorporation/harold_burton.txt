justice
harold
burton
and
may
i
ask
you
just
there,
is
it
clear
in
your
mind
that
the
liability
of
the
shipowner
is
on
the
basis
of
negligence
and
not
on
the
basis
of
unseaworthiness?
justice
harold
burton
they
took
a
different
of
view
of
the
quality
of
the
negligence.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
colby,
he
says
it
has
not
exonerated
him
if
he
makes
in
the
agreement
of
indemnity.
justice
harold
burton
and
if
he
doesn't
make
an
agreement
of
indemnity,
you
say
it
doesn't
exonerate
him
either?
justice
harold
burton
is
that
right?
