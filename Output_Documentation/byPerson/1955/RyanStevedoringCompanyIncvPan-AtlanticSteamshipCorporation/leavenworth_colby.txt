mr.
leavenworth
colby
may
it
please
the
court.
as
amicus
curiae
for
this
case,
the
government
is
interested
in
spite
a
different
problem.
as
you
have
heard
here
today,
the
shape
of
this
case
is
determined
by
the
peculiar
organization
of
waterman
steamship
company
and
its
two
subsidiaries,
ryan
stevedoring
and
pan-atlantic
steamship
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
circumstance
that
in
the
compensation
insurance
policy
of
ryan
stevedoring
company,
there
is
in
addition
to
the
compensation
coverage
a
clause
1b
of
the
standard
new
york
form
policy
which
to
the
extent
of
$25,000
will
indemnify
ryan
stevedoring
company
against
secondary
losses
arising
out
of
injury
to
their
employee.
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
of
stevedore
does
not
insure
its
risks
and
in
its
capacity
of
shipowner
does
not
insure
very
many
of
its
risks.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
litigation
now
pending
in
the
district
courts
arose,
the
government
was
primarily
a
shipowner.
indeed,
in
mr.
schwartz's
petition
for
rehearing,
your
honors
may
have
noticed
that
the
vast
majority,
i
think
about
65%
of
the
cases
involving
this
problem
that
are
listed
as
pending,
are
cases
in
which
the
united
states
were
shipowner.
at
the
present
time
however,
we
are
operating
only
an
average
of
20
vessels
at
the
end
of
each
month.
that's
the
way
they
make
up
the
statistics
form.
so
that
we
are
not
so
important
as
a
shipowner.
we
continue
to
be
very
important
as
a
stevedore
and
as
a
ship
repairman.
i
have
had
some
difficulty
getting
statistics
in
respect
of
the
government's
interest
as
stevedore
and
ship
repairman
because
except
for
the
panama
canal,
the
panama
canal
company,
they
do
not
make
very
good
statistics.
but
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
during
the
fiscal
years,
1955
and
the
preceding
year
1954,
the
panama
canal
company
alone
stevedored
3118
vessels
in
1955
and
stevedored
2882
vessels
in
1954.
it
was
a
ship
repair
contractor
in
respect
of
1254
vessels
in
1955
and
1169
vessels
in
1954.
and
so,
the
government
feels
that
by
a
reason
of
its
large
interest,
both
as
a
stevedore
contractor
and
as
a
ship
repair
contractor
and
after
all
the
rights
are
similar
and
as
a
shipowner
we
are
entitled
to
point
out
that
our
view
of
this
--
of
the
problems
here
is
somewhat
different.
as
mr.
behrens
has
pointed
out,
he
feels
and
i
think
correctly
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
his
favor
on
two
theories,
not
one.
one
of
the
theories
was
the
theory
of
indemnity
for
major
and
minor
fault
under
the
law
of
something
very
similar
to
joint
tortfeasorship.
and
he
has
explained
to
you
in
his
closing
argument
here
why
he
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
upholding
him
on
that
ground.
now,
this
is
important
in
this
particular
case
because
such
a
liability
is
clearly
within
clause
1b
of
the
standard
form
compensation
act
and
he's
indemnified
for
with
respect
to
masters
ryan,
the
subsidiary
of
pan-atlantic
--
the
subsidiary
of
waterman
to
be
extended
$25,000.
so
that's
$25,000
that
waterman
subsidiary
don't
have
to
pickup.
now,
on
the
other
theory
which
the
court
of
appeals
equally
sustained
the
case
on
that
is
to
say
breach
of
the
contract
for
professional
employment.
it
is
highly
doubtful
in
my
mind
that
clause
1b
applies.
and
of
course
if
it
doesn't
apply,
why
that's
$25,000
more
that
ryan
stevedoring
has
got
to
pay
for.
so
the
necessity
for
dealing
with
this
as
a
joint
tortfeasorship
problem
is
barely
obvious
as
between
the
advocates
who've
addressed
the
court
today.
now,
as
i
say
the
government
doesn't
insure
itself
and
its
problems
are
different.
and
we
believe
that
the
correct
approach
to
the
problem
is
the
old
familiar
one
that
when
you
hire
the
garageman
to
repair
the
car,
you
don't
undertake
to
hire
someone
else
or
yourself
to
test
the
car
to
see
whether
he
performed
his
contract
and
that's
what
this
is
about.
now,
there
are
of
course
considerations
on
both
sides
and
the
government
is
interested
on
both
sides.
but
basically,
what
mr.
schwartz
is
trying
to
tell
us
here
today
is
that
the
view
previously
taken
by
the
courts
in
respect
of
professional
employment
shall
be
changed
in
order
to
conform
that
abuse
that
the
court
have
taken
with
respect
to
joint
tortfeasorship
and
with
this
the
government
disagrees.
in
work,
the
question
that
we
think
has
to
be
resolved
here
is
whether
it
is
compatible
with
public
policy
to
read
section
5
of
the
compensation
act
as
exonerating
an
expert
contractor
from
liability
to
his
customer
for
breach
of
his
contract
caused
by
his
own
negligence
in
badly
performing
the
work
he
contracted
to
do
with
professional
skill
and
care.
now,
mr.
schwartz
says
that
when
you
hire
a
stevedore
to
stevedore
a
vessel
properly
and
he
doesn't
do
it,
you
may
not
recover
the
damages
that
you
suffered
by
reason
of
his
breach
of
contract.
and
he
said
that
is
due
to
section
5
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
now,
i
find
it
extremely
unlikely
that
this
is
the
law.
mr.
schwartz
has
cited
you
the
cases
that
hold
that
indemnity
being
joint
tortfeasorship
cases
is
to
go
by
the
same
rule
as
contribution
and
that
there
isn't
any.
that
maybe
correct.
we
are
not
interested
but
mr.
schwartz
has
an
obligato
to
his
argument
in
which
he
contends
that
section
5
has
also
exonerated
an
expert
contractor
from
liability
to
his
customer
for
breach
of
contract.
now,
much
has
been
made
to
the
question
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
now
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
now,
if
your
honor
will
recall,
when
you
hire
the
garageman,
when
you
hire
a
furnish
repairman,
when
you
hire
an
elevator
repairman
and
it's
just
the
same
when
you
hire
a
ship
repairer
or
a
stevedore,
9
times
out
of
10
you
don't
sign
with
him
a
written
contract
which
contains
any
clauses
whatsoever,
you
call
him
up
on
the
telephone
and
say
i
want
it
fixed.
you
take
the
car
into
the
garage
and
you
say
fix
it.
and
nobody
signs
anything
and
there
are
no
clauses
in
there
that
say
that
he
does
promise
to
do
the
work
skillfully
and
respond
in
damages
if
he
does
it
badly
or
that
he
won't.
now,
most
stevedoring
at
least
where
the
government
is
concerned
is
done
on
the
same
basis.
some
naval
supply
officer
calls
up
a
stevedoring
company
on
the
phone
and
says,
"you
stevedored
for
us
before,
will
you
take
care
of
this?
we
don't
have
the
personnel
to
see
to
it."
comes
under
all
circumstances,
they
sometimes
stevedore
aboard
regular
battleships
due
to
the
fact
that
enough
of
the
crew
is
going
on
leave
and
are
not
regarded
as
skillful
in
shore
sided
operations.
the
court
is
not
a
--
the
pier
is
not
a
military
pier,
all
sorts
of
variations
like
this.
it
also
goes
on
with
respect
to
other
vessels.
now,
the
army
has
a
habit
of
signing
formal
stevedoring
contracts
by
the
year
at
the
port
of
new
york
and
we
had
one
such
contract
before
this
court
in
the
porello
case.
but
those
are
quite
exceptional
from
the
standpoint
of
number
of
contracts.
i
suspect
they're
barely
exceptional
even
from
the
standpoint
of
volume,
dollars
and
cents
wise,
the
payments
made
by
the
government
for
stevedoring
the
vessel.
i
also
have
the
impression,
not
dignify
it
further,
that
by
and
large
when
we're
acting
as
stevedore
through
the
panama
canal
and
through
other
facilities,
we
don't
ordinarily
sign
when
we're
the
stevedore
contractor,
formal
contracts
with
anybody.
now,
from
time
immemorial,
it
has
been
assumed
that
when
a
professional
contractor,
a
lawyer,
a
garageman,
an
elevator
repairman,
a
ship
repairman,
a
stevedore
holds
himself
out
to
do
a
good
professional
job
and
he
doesn't
do
a
good
professional
job
and
the
client
suffers
damage.
the
client
can
recover
those
damages
that
are
consequent
upon
the
expert's
reach
of
his
duty
that
he
assumed
to
do
the
job
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
believe
we
had.
we've
been
sued
for
about
everything.
they
are
not
numerically
large
at
the
present
time.
one
of
the
reasons,
there's
been
so
little
litigation
on
this
subject
is
that
until
mr.
schwartz
begun
his
contentions
that
the
same
rule
applied
to
the
garageman,
didn't
apply
to
the
stevedore,
there
was
very
little
of
this.
but
he
won
a
case
in
matthews
and
the
american
casualty
company,
at
least
the
other
way
around,
american
casualty
company
and
matthews,
and
he
has
been
endeavoring
to
extend
the
rule
since
with
great
success.
but
we
don't
think
he
should
extend
to
take
in
quite
everything.
now,
coming
back
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
the
accident
was
due
to
the
defective
part,
i
assume
he
would
not
and
those
holdings
have
been
made
with
respect
to
ship
repairmen
and
stevedores
and
this
court
has
denied
certiorari.
the
same
things
would
be
true,
i
think
for
the
garageman.
but
now,
the
type
of
situation
that
we
have
in
this
case
really,
we
will
now
adjudge
it
to
the
garageman,
as
i
take
my
car
into
the
garage
to
have
the
brakes
fixed
and
i
come
in
as
i
always
do
at
6
o'clock
when
they're
trying
to
shut
the
door
and
i
come
to
take
my
car
away
and
they've
got
it
aimed
out
so
i
can
go
out
the
door
and
i
get
in
and
i
start
the
car
and
i
press
on
the
brake
and
i
pushed
the
accelerator
pedal
a
couple
of
times
and
everything
seems
all
right
but
i
don't
make
any
test,
i
don't
go
into
anything
in
detail
although
i
have
done
it.
i
start
to
drive
the
car
out,
the
accelerator
pedal
jammed
because
of
something
that
they
did
when
they
were
fixing
the
brake.
and
i
could
have
--if
i
had
continued
my
investigation
there,
as
i
owe
the
duty
to
outsiders
to
do,
i
could
have
known
that
it
would
jam
but
i
didn't
and
i
started
out
the
accelerator
pedal
jammed,
the
car
went
forward,
the
car
strikes
another
customer's
car
and
in
the
other
customer's
car
is
riding
the
customer
and
a
car
jockey
employed
by
the
garage
contractor
who
just
did
the
job
for
me.
and
i
injured
the
other
customer's
car
and
i
injured
the
other
customer
and
i
injured
the
car
jockey
employed
by
my
garageman.
and
the
customer
sues
me
for
his
personal
injuries
and
for
the
damage
to
his
vehicle
and
the
car
jockey
brings
a
third-party
suit
against
me
for
his
personal
injuries.
it
may
all
recover
because
it's
holding
that
i
should
have
been
more
careful
in
testing
the
car
and
should
have
discovered
this
defectual
performance
by
my
garageman.
so
now,
i
turn
and
i
tried
to
sue
my
garageman
for
the
damage
that
he's
caused
me
by
doing
my
work
badly.
and
of
course
this
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
longshoremen's
and
the
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
the
local
compensation
act
and
what
this
court
decides
today
will
govern
what
is
done
in
the
case
of
the
garageman.
so
i
am
met
by
the
contention
of
the
garageman,
"oh,
you
can't
recover
because
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
which
is
the
compensation
act
to
the
district
of
columbia,
exonerates
me
from
liability
because
it
says
that
when
i
pay
my
employees,
as
the
garageman,
that's
the
extent
of
my
liability."
now,
i
don't
understand
mr.
schwartz's
contention
point.
i
don't
know
whether
he
says
it
exonerates
the
garageman
from
liability
for
damage
to
the
other
customer's
car
liability
over.
my
right
of
recovering
my
damages
in
the
form
of
what
i
had
to
pay
then
which
is
sometimes
called
indemnity
which
is
a
very
different
thing
from
indemnity
and
contribution.
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
schwartz
says,
"i
can't
recover
what
i
had
to
pay
the
customer
for
damage
to
his
car."
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
schwartz
says,
"i
can't
recover
for
the
injury
to
the
other
customer."
i
am
clear
that
mr.
schwartz
says,
"i
can't
recover
back
the
money
i
have
to
pay
the
car
jockey
because
of
the
breach
of
contract
by
my
garageman."
now,
this
has
never
been
the
law,
i'm
sure,
up
until
the
present
time
but
that
is
what
mr.
schwartz
is
asking
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
judge
inch,
i
take
it
must
have
had
in
his
opinion
in
mind
only
the
question
of
joint
tortfeasorship
and
indemnity
as
another
aspect
of
contribution.
i
do
not
think
that
judge
inch
paid
any
attention
at
all
in
his
opinion
that
the
fact
that
this
was
a
suit
by
a
ship
against
the
people
that
the
ship
had
employed
to
load
the
vessel
and
unload
it
properly.
so
i
don't
think
that
judge
inch
had
decided
the
question
of
contractual
liability
to
respond
in
damages
for
all
consequences
including
liability
to
pay
other
people
damages
of
a
breach
of
a
professional
contract
of
employment.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
i
suppose
it
would
at
some
extent
but
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
we
think
that
it
could
be
explained
in
a
way
and
you'll
notice
that
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
was
apparently
aware
of
the
coin
having
two
sides,
one,
breach
of
a
professional
contract
of
employment
with
the
liability
to
respond
in
damages
therefore
and
the
other,
contribution
and
indemnity
in
a
joint
tortfeasorship
sense.
now,
i
read
the
opinion
like
mr.
behrens
as
having
held
that
the
ship
should
have
recovered
on
both
theories.
now,
i'm
sure
that
waterman
steamship
company
represented
by
mr.
schwartz
and
mr.
behrens
in
both
in
a
sense,
although
they
both
represent
underwriters
too.
i'm
sure
that
waterman
steamship
company
would
prefer
to
have
this
case
rested
upon
the
ground
of
joint
tortfeasorship
type
indemnity
because
then
clearly
the
underwriter
on
ryan
stevedoring's
clause
1b
coverage,
we'll
pay
$25,000
and
if
it's
rested
on
breach
of
the
contract
of
professional
employment,
i'm
not
sure
that
they
will.
i
don't
think
that
any
of
the
decided
cases
on
clause
1b
have
said
that
you
pay
for
a
liability
rested
on
that
theory.
now,
they
might
so
hold
when
they
got
around
to
decided
it
but
the
new
york
case
which
would
govern
the
1b
coverage
in
this
case
of
cardinal
engineering
company,
which
you'll
find
somewhere
in
the
government's
brief
there,
did
not
deal
with
a
recovery
on
the
theory
of
breach
of
a
contractual
duty
owed
to
the
client.
now,
that's
what
this
is
about
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
facts
of
this
situation
that
we're
being
asked
to
put
the
burden
on
the
ship.
your
honors
will
notice
on
this
record
that
there
was
a
mate
here,
just
one
mate,
the
cargo
mate.
he
is
supposed
to
be
in
general
supervision
of
the
ship.
now,
what
does
that
mean
from
the
standpoint
of
supervising
the
stevedores?
there
were
five
hatches
and
number
three
was
a
double
hatch.
so
in
number
three
there
were
two
stevedore
gangs
working
and
in
each
one
of
the
other
hatches,
there
was
one
stevedore
gang
working.
now,
that's
six
stevedore
gangs.
each
stevedore
gang
consists
of
21
men,
the
record
so
show
us.
now,
these
21
men
are
divided
as
follows.
there
are
three
men
who
look
after
the
winches.
there
is
a
hatch
boss.
in
other
words,
six
hatch
bosses
for
the
--
for
the
six
gangs
operating
on
the
four
single
and
one
double
hatch.
one
hatch
boss,
one
gangway
man
who
does
the
signaling
for
the
lifts,
then
there
are
eight
men
on
the
dock
and
eight
men
in
the
hold.
and
the
eight
men
in
the
hold
are
divided
into
four
offshore
men
and
four
inshore
men
or
four
at
the
side
of
the
ship
towards
the
dock.
now,
that
is
the
personnel
right
on
the
ship.
now,
i
think
the
record
shows,
but
i
wouldn't
prepare
--
pretend
to
sufficiently
accurate
knowledge,
i
may
have
been
mistaken
but
the
usual
practice
is
in
addition
the
stevedore
has
a
ship
supervisor
and
ordinarily
a
pier
supervisor.
so
now,
you
have
six
foremen,
six
hatch
bosses
which
are
supervisory
personnel
for
the
stevedore
contractor.
you
have
at
least
a
ship
supervisor,
who
is
supervisory
personnel
for
the
stevedore
contractor,
and
you
may
have
a
pier
supervisor
besides
who
would
be
over
all
the
ships
that
were
loading
at
that
pier
at
that
time
and
would
come
down
with
chain
of
command
to
the
ship
supervisor.
now,
with
all
these
supervisory
personnel
and
all
these
group
of
men
stevedoring
the
vessel
and
remember
the
contracting
stevedore
has
been
employed
for
his
expertise
in
how
to
load
a
vessel.
he's
employed
to
know
something
that
a
cargo
mate
is
not
supposed
to.
the
cargo
mate
is
to
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
shipowner
absolutely
responsible
to
see
that
the
stevedore
contractor
does
his
work
right.
one
little
man
who
has
to
go
in
to
five
hatches
then
and
be
omnipresent
and
see
what
six
gangs
of
21
men
each
are
supposed
to
do
and
he
is
supposed
to
be
the
man
that's
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
expert,
for
whom
the
ship
has
paid,
has
done
his
work
right.
now,
we've
got
in
our
brief
a
lot
of
cases
and
i
never
thought
it
was
controverted
until
today
that
when
you
hire
an
expert,
you
don't
owe
him
any
duty
to
inspect
his
work,
to
see
that
he
does
it
right.
he
owes
the
duty
to
you
to
do
it
right
because
you're
paying
him
to
do
it
right.
but
mr.
schwartz
says
that
the
ship
was
in
control
through
it's
cargo
mate
and
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
ship
to
see
that
this
professional
stevedore
did
right
what
it
was
paid
to
do
and
because
they
didn't
do
their
work
right,
the
ship
is
responsible
and
then
he
says,
"and
besides
in
any
event,
section
5
--
code
section
905,
the
compensation
act
says
that
they
can't
be
responsible
if
they're
good
boys
and
pay
their
employees
the
compensation
that
congress
is
providing."
now,
i
do
not
think
that's
the
law
and
we've
explained
it
very
plain
in
our
brief
why
we
think
it
isn't.
now,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
about
the
general
situation
that
develops
in
the
course
of
these
cases
with
respect
to
reading
section
5.
now,
as
the
court
has
noticed,
everybody
says
the
legislative
history
was
silent.
all
this
court
has
really
ever
been
able
to
find
out
about
the
longshoremen's
and
compensation
--
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
in
any
case
is
that
congress
patterned
it
after
the
new
york
compensation
act
because
as
mr.
behrens
explained
yesterday,
they
had
been
unsuccessful
in
having
the
local
compensation
acts
applied
in
maritime
cases.
afterwards,
congress
applied
the
same
longshoremen's
compensation
act
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
the
local
compensation
act
and
applied
it
to
the
overseas
defense
basis
as
the
defense
basis
act.
both
the
d.c.compensation
act
and
the
defense
basis
act,
in
other
words,
the
one
section
in
the
acts
state
the
rights
are
governed
by
the
longshoremen's
act.
now
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
does
your
honor
talking
now
about
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
that
covers
government
employees?
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
longshoremen's?
oh,
yes.
that
is
of
course
what
was
done
here.
mr.
palazzolo,
the
man
who
was
injured
on
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
don't
think
i
can
recall
all
of
them.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
it
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
as
mr.
schwartz
explained
the
injured
employee
under
the
longshoremen's
act
just
the
same
as
the
injured
employee
under
a
state
compensation
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
may
--
may
sue
a
third
party.
now,
that's
all
taken
place,
he
got
his
money,
the
compensation
carrier
got
their
money
back.
now,
that's
this
case.
that's
true
in
every
case.
now,
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
the
question
of
whether
section
5
or
whether
the
circumstances
of
these
cases
prevent
the
person
who
employs
the
garageman
or
the
stevedore
or
whatever,
recovering
his
damages
in
the
form
of
what
he
had
to
pay
a
third
party
who
was
injured.
and
as
i
say,
i
find
no
cases
cited
that
hold
that
he
has.
i
find
cases
cited
by
mr.
schwartz
very
well
that
in
respect
of
joint
tortfeasorhip,
indemnity
goes
by
the
same
rule
as
contribution.
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
the
other
way
too
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
mr.
behrens
is
not
more
than
correct
in
saying
that
he
thinks
so
as
a
better
reason.
but
now,
that's
the
problem.
now,
looking
at
section
5
and
applying
the
--
the
just
and
generous
rule,
we
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
obligations
arising
out
of
a
contract
of
professional
employment
of
the
professional
contractor
to
respond
in
damages
to
his
client.
we're
not
within
the
universe
that
congress
intended
to
take
away
liability.
now,
that's
the
--
that's
the
first
consideration.
then
there
is
the
phenomena
that
as
i
say
state
and
federal
cases
on
this
problem
of
professional
responsibility
have
not
gone
that
way.
finally,
we
think
that
public
policy
requires,
just
like
in
the
both-to-blame
situation,
both-to-blame
clause
in
the
cargo
case,
the
atlantic
mutual
insurance
company
case.
public
policy
requires
leaving
the
responsibility
or
the
professional
expert's
negligence
on
the
professional
expert
and
not
shifting
it
to
the
client
or
customer.
so
that
we
think
that
in
the
absence
of
a
legislative
history
that
should
compel
a
construction
that
section
5
didn't
apply.
now
additionally,
if
your
honors
will
recall
what
we
had
before
us
in
the
atlantic
mutual
insurance
company,
both-to-blame
case,
they
have
the
same
problem
that
mr.
schwartz
talked
about
here
today.
the
question
was
that
it
was
anomalous
that
the
ship
should
be
fully
exonerated
from
paying
for
cargo
damage
if
it
was
solely
at
fault.
but
when
the
other
ship
was
at
fault
too,
it
should
have
to
pay
half
the
damages.
but
your
honors
had
no
difficulty
with
that.
now,
that
litigation
through
the
years
followed
the
same
pattern
as
we
have
here
today.
in
the
delaware,
back
in
volume
161
of
the
united
states
reports.
the
question
had
come
up
of
whether
since
the
ship,
the
other
ship,
a
non-carrying
ship
with
respect
to
the
cargo
in
a
both-to-blame
situation
would
be
able
if
--
would
be
able
to
pay
the
cargo
owner
the
full
value
of
his
cargo
that
was
lost
and
then
collect
over
against
the
carrying
ship,
did
section
3
of
the
harter
act,
which
was
written
with
the
same
universality
as
section
5
of
the
compensation
act,
exonerate
the
carrying
vessel
from
liability
to
the
non-carrying
vessel.
in
other
words,
could
they,
like
mr.
schwartz
wants
to
do
with
the
stevedore
here,
put
all
of
the
burden
on
to
the
non-carrying
vessel
and
treat
the
section
3
of
the
harter
act
as
a
sword
as
well
as
the
shield,
just
as
my
brother
here
wants
to
preach
--
to
treat
section
5
the
compensation
act,
as
a
sword
as
well
as
the
shield
and
the
court
said,
"oh,
no."
and
so,
form
the
time
of
the
delaware
on,
it
was
necessary
for
the
carrying
ship,
although
it
was
free
when
it
was
solely
at
fault,
to
pay
half
the
damage
to
the
cargo
in
those
cases
where
the
other
ship
was
also
at
fault.
and
then
in
atlantic
mutual,
last
term,
we
got
up
to
the
problem
of
could
the
carrying
ship
by
contract
take
the
position
that
mr.
schwartz
wants
to
take
here
today.
he
was
asked
this
very
question.
now,
we
held
in
the
atlantic
mutual
insurance
company
that
he
couldn't,
although
it
was
not
more
symmetrical
for
the
carrying
ship
not
to
pay
anything
when
it
was
jointly
at
fault.
the
same
as
it
did
when
it
was
solely
at
fault.
still
the
public
policy
of
making
the
contractor
liable
for
his
own
negligence
dictated
the
contrary
solution.
and
we
think
that's
the
situation
here
today
that
the
policy,
the
general
public
policy
of
making
the
contractor,
the
professional
contractor
to
pose
himself
out,
solely
liable
for
his
fault,
shouldn't
bring
about
the
construction
of
section
5
to
exonerate
it.
thank
you.
