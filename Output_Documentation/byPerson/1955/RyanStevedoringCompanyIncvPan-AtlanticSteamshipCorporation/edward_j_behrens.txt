mr.
edward
j.
behrens
if
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
in
a
preparatory
way
to
say
that
i
am
here
fundamentally
to
discuss
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
peculiar
case.
i
am
mindful
of
the
broad
sweep
of
some
of
the
problems
which
could
be
here,
some
of
the
problems
that
maybe
in
the
other
cases.
but
we
have
here
first,
a
unique
factual
situation
which
must
be
fully
appreciated
before
we
can
approach
these
problems
that
may
exist
in
other
cases.
i
say
it's
unique
because
ordinarily,
this
whole
problem
of
whose
insurance
company
pays
the
loss
or
who
pays
the
loss
if
they
have
enough
insurance
is
taken
care
of
by
the
contract
between
the
ship
and
the
stevedore.
that's
the
ordinary
case.
your
honor's
have
had
that
type
of
case
here,
in
porello,
to
determine
how
broad
is
this
indemnity
provision
of
the
agreement.
these
are
businessmen
who
are
dealing
with
an
everyday
problem,
who
shall
bear
this
loss
in
the
event
that
the
stevedore
does
it
for
a
job.
but
here
we
had
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
of
a
common
parent
and
so
they
didn't
deal
with
one
another
as
we
have
in
the
usual
case.
there
were
two
letters
exchanged
in
two
office
memoranda.
they
did
comprise
the
contract
all
right
and
a
written
contract
but
all
they
covered
were
rates
and
ports
where
stevedoring
services
where
to
be
performed.
that
is
the
general
situation
as
it
affects
our
clients.
we
are
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
of
this
common
parent
and
therefore
the
informal
written
agreement.
i
point
to
the
agreement
only
to
indicate
that
we
are
not
in
any
field
of
quasi-contract.
we
have
a
contract
here
and
we
are
in
the
question
of
implied
contract
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
wrote
here.
what
is
the
first
problem
factually?
what
is
the
nature
of
the
claim
that
the
injured
longshoreman
made
against
us
the
shipowner?
what
was
his
complaint?
now,
that
is
pointed
up
with
peculiarly
by
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
harlan
concerning
seaworthiness
because
he
made
both
claims.
he
did
claim
that
when
this
cargo
with
rolls
of
paper
was
stowed
aboard
this
vessel
by
ryan
at
georgetown,
south
carolina,
they
had
not
put
adequate
chocking
underneath
it.
in
other
words,
as
each
paper
roll
was
brought
and
rolled
along
and
put
into
its
place
in
the
hold
of
the
ship,
something
had
to
be
put
under
it
to
keep
it
from
rolling
back.
and
his
complaint
was
that
the
chocks
put
underneath
weren't
adequate
to
hold
it,
so
that
when
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
the
chocks
or
wedges
would
be
ship's
gear
because
the
mate
testified
that
there
were
chock
--
chocks,
these
chocks
both
aboard
the
vessel
and
on
the
dock
at
georgetown.
that
was
never
disputed.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
oh,
yes,
the
longshoreman
testified
that
what
had
been
used
instead
of
the
chocks,
but
the
availability
of
the
chocks
was
not
disputed.
it
was
the
use
of
them.
they
testified
that
pieces
that
were
two
small
had
been
put
underneath.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
well,
one
--
one
of
the
longshoreman
testified
that
it
was
usual
in
his
experience
for
this
to
be
chocked
by
this
company
with
dunnage
instead
of
this
sort
of
chock
that
the
mate
described.
in
other
words,
it
was
the
conflict
in
evidence
that
there
was.
he
said
the
mate
--
and
this
is
i
think
important
because
of
the
factual
statement
which
mr.
schwartz
has
presented.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes,
the
mate
--
first
of
all,
when
they
talk
about
this
mate,
that
mate
was
on
watch
for
4
of
the
20
hours
that
the
vessel
took
this
cargo.
now,
he
wasn't
there
all
of
the
time.
that's
the
first
point
in
writing
my
brief
because
i
suspected
there
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
talk
about
what
the
mate
did
and
he
didn't
do.
i
very
carefully
keyed
to
the
record
at
pages
4
and
5
of
my
brief
exactly
what
the
mate
did
do
and
this
is
what
he
did.
first
of
all,
to
recreate
that
picture,
there
was
this
cargo
being
loaded
simultaneously
into
five
different
hatches.
one
mate,
the
loading
took
20
hours.
this
particular
mate
that
judge
inch
talks
about
was
there
for
4
of
the
20
hours.
now,
what
did
he
have
to
do?
well,
he
couldn't
spend
all
of
his
time
in
any
one
hatch.
this
happened
--
to
have
occurred
in
number
three,
but
he
had
five
hatches
to
look
at.
he
had
no
authority
to
direct
any
of
ryan's
men
in
the
manner
of
loading
the
cargo
and
did
not
supervise
the
detail
of
the
stow.
this
question
of
supervision
is
just
the
other
way
around
in
this
record.
he
didn't
supervise
it,
indeed
he
couldn't.
he
testified
and
nobody
questioned
him
that
there
were
proper
chocks
on
the
vessel
and
the
dock.
now,
the
mate
said
he'd
seen
them
use
proper
chocks.
came
the
witnesses
for
the
injured
longshoreman
and
they
said,
oh,
no,
this
weren't
properly
chocked.
the
chocks
underneath
them
weren't
adequate
chocks.
but
now,
from
time
to
time
during
the
loading
of
this
cargo,
he
couldn't
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
a
matter
good
sense
whether
ryan
had
chocked
them
or
he
hadn't,
why,
because
as
each
roll
was
put
in
place
and
the
chocks
are
put
under
it,
you
roll
the
next
--
roll
along
side
of
it,
you
can't
see
whether
its
chock
now
or
not.
this
mate
was
in
and
out
of
five
holes,
presumptively,
the
only
one
on
watch
for
4
of
the
20
hours
and
that
is
the
activity
which
mr.
schwartz
constitutes
as
some
active
affirmative
negligence
which
even
judge
inch
didn't
find.
and
i'll
tell
your
honor
what
judge
inch
did
find
and
why
this
question
became
so
important
as
to
unseaworthiness
and
negligence.
the
judge
removed
from
consideration
by
the
jury
anything
that
happened
at
the
time
of
unloading.
whatever
ryan
did
or
didn't
do
at
the
time
of
unloading
was
removed
and
the
only
question
that
went
to
the
jury
was
whether
the
stow
at
georgetown
was
good
or
bad.
that
is
what
the
original
plaintiff
had
asserted.
that
is
the
issue
we
had
tried
and
that
was
the
issue
the
jury
was
to
pass
on.
there
was
no
issue
between
mr.
schwartz's
client
and
mine.
i
called
no
witness
against
him.
he
called
no
witness
against
me.
we
stipulated
the
facts.
the
quarrel
was
between
the
injured
longshoreman
and
the
vessel
owner
and
the
only
question
was
whether
that
stow
at
georgetown
was
good
or
bad.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
well,
he
testified
it
was
good
as
far
at
he
was
concerned,
as
far
as
he
knew
it
was
good.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that's
right
and
that
problem
was
resolved
against
us.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
oh,
that
is
a
fundamental
fact
in
this
case.
it
has
been
decided
by
a
jury
that
the
stow
was
bad.
now,
the
next
question
comes
if
the
stow
was
bad,
where
do
we
get
by
separating
negligence
and
unseaworthiness?
that
was
one
of
my
big
complaints
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
thought
required
the
result
that
we
did
achieve
there.
we
are
all
familiar
with
a
difference
between
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
this
court
has
written
of
course
unseaworthiness
is
the
species
of
liability
without
any
fault.
and
certainly,
negligence
has
in
its
essence
some
fault.
when
the
judge
charged
the
jury
here,
he
put
those
two
concepts
into
a
pot.
he
intermingled
them
and
he
intermingled
them
so
that
no
lawyer
and
certainly
no
layman
could
separate
them
and
he
threw
that
issue
to
the
jury
as
one
whole
problem.
and
when
the
jury
verdict
came
back,
holding
the
stow
was
bad
because
that
was
the
fact
issue,
then
when
it
came
time
to
find
out
about
my
rights
over
against
the
stevedore
then
he
started
for
the
first
time
to
separate
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
and
to
go
on
this
theory
of
negligence
which
has
now
been
characterized
as
active
or
something
of
that
type
in
order
to
put
a
label.
he
made
no
fact
finding
we
were
joint
tortfeasors.
he
put
a
legal
label
upon
an
admitted
set
of
facts.
but
i
thought
of
course
he
ignored
the
contractual
relationship
between
us.
the
fact
that
we
had
a
binding
agreement
was
utterly
ignored
and
so
he
went
exclusively
to
find
out
if
somehow
or
rather
he
could
put
negligence
on
us,
although
when
he
gave
it
to
a
jury,
he
threw
it
to
the
jury
in
one
piece,
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
intermingled.
that
was
one
of
my
first
and
greatest
and
sincerest
complaints
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
with
that
posture
of
the
case,
it
really
wasn't
fair.
it
was
almost
like
changing
the
rules
in
the
middle
of
the
game.
if
there
wasn't
any
difference
between
unseaworthiness
and
negligence
as
far
as
the
plaintiff
against
me,
now
why
should
you
start
to
chop
him
in
half
when
you
look
for
my
claim
over
--
against
the
stevedore?
now,
what
did
judge
inch
actually
find?
he
found
the
mate
failed
to
discover
that
these
people
had
done
a
poor
job.
that's
what
he
held
against
us
and
that's
all
he
held.
and
here's
what
he
wrote
that
the
cargo
officer
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
should
have
discovered
and
corrected
the
condition.
in
other
words,
we
didn't
find
out
that
these
people
would
do
--
had
done
a
bad
job
when
they
have
been
paid
to
do
a
good
work.
when
we've
got
into
the
court
of
the
appeals,
the
court
unanimously
could
find
two
basis
upon
either
one
of
which
we
were
entitled
to
have
in
fact
whatever
this
accident
had
caused
us.
one
basis
might
be
called
court,
the
law
of
active
and
passive
negligence.
the
theory
having
been
expressed
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
other
courts
on
many
occasions
that
if
the
conduct
of
two
persons
has
contributed
or
caused
an
event
and
the
one
has
been
the
primary
or
active
or
substantially
responsible
and
the
other
merely
negligent
in
a
negative
or
passive
way
that
the
court
will
work
out
contribution
and
the
hold
the
one
harmless
and
for
whom
it
--
him
who
was
negative
and
who
failed
to
do
this
and
failed
to
do
that
to
reproof
his
damage
from
the
one
who
is
active.
but
i
never
briefed
substantially
or
urged
in
this
court
a
great
deal
on
that
subject
because
the
court
of
appeals
found
something
i
thought
was
so
unimpeachable
that
if
your
honor's
could
find
one
basis
of
soundness
for
the
conclusion
they
had
reached
that
that
would
dispose
the
problem
and
that's
the
contract.
i
think
it's
so
sound
but
there
is
no
brief
in
opposition
to
the
point.
the
point
is
simply
this,
that
if
i
hire
an
expert
to
do
a
job
by
his
--
hire
someone
because
of
their
peculiar
skill
or
knowledge,
it's
understood
they'll
do
a
good
job.
now,
there
isn't
anything
particularly
maritime
about
that,
it
lies
to
affairs
on
the
land
as
well
as
on
the
sea
if
i
hire
a
man
to
repair
the
raptures
in
my
house
so
the
roof
won't
fall
in.
i
don't
have
to
put
down
in
lawyer's
language
or
with
seals
or
ribbons
that
he
will
do
a
good
job.
that's
an
implied
part
of
his
undertaking.
so
in
this
case,
it
was
an
implied
part
of
the
undertaking
that
ryan
as
a
special,
let's
say,
stevedore
embarked
upon
that
they
do
a
good
job
in
stowing
the
cargo.
now,
they
did
a
bad
job.
the
juries
found
it.
the
stow
was
poor.
they
breached
their
contract.
i
don't
think
they
deny
it
and
so
--
well,
if
they
come
here
to
do
is
to
confess
and
avoid.
yes,
we
breached
our
contract
but
because
we
fulfilled
our
obligation
to
our
employees,
we
--
we
don't
owe
you
anything.
because
of
905
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act,
we've
been
good
to
our
employees
and
therefore
we
can't
be
held
liable
for
breach
of
contract
or
a
suit
for
rent
or
such
other
things.
what
the
whole
argument
fails
to
see
is
that
there
are
these
two
separate
and
distinct
lines
of
obligation
to
which
mr.
justice
reed
referred
a
few
moments
ago,
that
as
an
employer,
ryan
did
oath
to
palazzolo,
an
employee,
certain
obligations
and
put
to
us
in
the
status
of
contract
with
us
being
the
other
point,
they
owed
us
some
obligations
too.
and
when
they
satisfied
their
obligations
to
palazzolo,
what
sense
is
there
for
them
to
say,
“we
owe
you
nothing.
we
owe
our
landlord
nothing.
we
owe
no
one
else
in
the
world
anything.”
because
the
effect
of
the
argument
here
about
905
is
that
this
immunity
runs
in
favor
of
the
whole
world
that
a
stevedore
procuring
compensation
to
his
employees
can't
be
guilty
of
breach
of
contract.
now,
that's
the
basis
of
the
first
argument.
what's
wrong
with
it?
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
referred
a
few
minutes
ago
to
looking
at
a
statute.
i'm
not
reading
it
too
literally.
i
say
let
us
look
at
the
history
of
this
statute.
let's
look
at
the
history
of
this
statute
in
this
court,
what
had
this
court
done
that
caused
this
statute
to
come
into
being?
back
in
1913,
an
attempt
was
made
to
bring
a
longshoreman
in
under
the
new
york
state
workmen's
compensation
law.
it
was
as
far
back
as
that.
when
the
case
came
up
here,
this
court
held
that
you
couldn't
do
that.
that
longshoremen
where
engaged
in
the
maritime
work.
they
work
to
be
governed
by
maritime
considerations
and
it
is
our
maritime
policy
that
there'd
be
uniformity,
that
you
couldn't
apply
a
state
law
of
workmen's
compensation
whether
it
was
promulgated
by
one
state
or
another
or
a
fourth
or
a
fifth.
and
so
in
the
jensen
case,
this
court
held
that
wouldn't
be
constitutional.
you
couldn't
do
it
that
way.
so
congress
tried
to
get
a
workmen's
compensation
law
in
for
longshoremen
and
they
tried
it
in
this
way.
they
amended
the
judiciary
act,
a
couple
of
years
later,
to
give
jurisdiction
to
admiralty
courts
of
claims
by
injured
workmen
under
state
compensation
law.
the
constitutionality
of
that
was
challenged
and
this
court
said,
“no,
you
can't
do
it
that
way.
you
can't
blank
in
it
48
different
state
compensation
laws,
you've
got
to
have
uniformity.”
so
congress
tried
to
get
another
workmen's
compensation
law
through
for
longshoremen.
mind
you,
we're
talking
about
workmen's
compensation
and
nothing
else.
they
put
in
the
so-called
mills
amendment,
again
trying
to
blank
it
into
a
federal
system,
the
different
workmen's
compensation
laws
of
the
48
states.
and
again
this
court
said,
“you
can't
do
it
that
way.”
and
then
this
court
said
how
it
could
be
done.
congress
would
have
to
enact
a
workmen's
compensation
law
that
would
be
a
uniform
application
throughout
the
united
states
and
with
that
history
and
that
background
of
attempts
to
put
into
effect
the
workmen's
compensation
law,
finally
in
1927,
this
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
came
into
effect.
if
it
was
anything
more
than
a
definition
of
the
rights
and
remedies
of
employer
and
employee,
there
wasn't
anything
in
its
history
that
would
indicate
that
fact.
now,
we
are
interested
in
the
statute.
what
did
the
--
they
say
about
in
the
congress?
any
congressman
have
any
different
ideas
as
to
what
this
statute
meant?
and
the
answer
is
that
the
petitioner
admits
there
wasn't
a
word
on
it
at
anytime
while
this
was
going
on
in
congress
for
years
that
would
support
the
idea
that
they
were
doing
anything
except
dealing
in
the
field
of
employer-employee.
and
certainly,
i
think
that
any
of
those
legislators
would
be
amazed
to
hear
that
this
legislation
between
employer
and
employee
is
now
sought
to
be
some
sort
of
--
have
some
effect
upon
the
rights
of
a
contractor,
landlord
and
tenant
or
who
knows
what
when
all
that
congress
said
--
about
to
do
was
to
put
a
workmen's
compensation
law
into
this
maritime
field.
now,
so
far
as
the
generalities
of
the
situation
are
concerned
as
much
has
been
said
about
hydra-headed
litigation,
that
there's
something
wrong
here,
that
something
about
the
conduit
theory.
that
indirectly
something
is
being
done
that
can't
be
done
directly.
i
--
i'm
trying
to
admit
that
at
first
blush
sometimes
that
looks
that
way.
but
actually
by
our
use
of
third-party
practice,
i
don't
think
that
all
procedural
mode
of
operation
can
obscure
the
two
lines
of
rights
which
are
involved
here.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
many,
many
years
ago,
and
to
let
the
problem
with
our
own
workmen's
compensation
law
and
which
indeed
is
the
basis
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
it's
modeled
after
our
new
york
law.
they
held
that
that
won't
bare
analysis
that
after
all
an
employee
has
rights
against
his
employer
and
those
are
solved
by
the
compensation
law.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
obligations
of
that
man,
no
longer
as
an
employer
but
as
a
contractor,
he's
got
to
stand
on
his
own
feet
and
he
can't
point
to
a
satisfaction
to
these
other
obligations.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
in
other
words,
if
he
had
been
an
employee
of
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
of
my
claim.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
no,
my
claim
would
be
the
same
whether
he's
their
employee
or
not.
indeed,
i
think
the
--
one
of
the
clear
instances
of
that
is
supposed
but
instead
of
the
court
of
--
i
--
i
have
just
this
thought.
suppose
that
it
wasn't
palazzolo
who
got
hurt
at
all
but
that
this
stow
fell
down
because
they
did
a
bad
job
of
stowing
it
and
the
cargo
was
damaged.
and
now,
comes
the
owner
of
the
cargo,
to
me
the
shipowner,
and
says,
“you
must
pay
the
damage.”
and
we
pay
him
damage.
now,
we
come
back
to
the
stevedore
and
say,
“well
now,
really
you
did
it.
you
breached
your
contract
with
me,
pay
me
damage.”
certainly,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
talk
about
workmen's
compensation
law,
nothing
like
this
case.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
adjourned
yesterday,
i
had
practically
completed
the
presentation
of
my
views
concerning
the
possible
effect
upon
section
905,
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act,
upon
those
they
were
not
employees
or
claiming
by
subrogation
through
employees.
i
have
referred
to
the
two
lines
of
obligation
which
i
thought
were
in
existence.
those
two
separate
lines
of
obligations
which
have
been
found
by
every
state
court,
dealing
with
every
state
compensation
statute
which
counsel
confined
in
this
case.
when
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
was
before
this
court,
this
court
adjudged
it
constitutional
referring
to
the
fact
that
as
between
stevedore
and
longshoremen,
between
employer
and
an
employee,
there
was
indeed
quid
pro
quo,
each
was
giving
up
something,
each
was
getting
something.
under
the
old
law,
without
a
workmen's
compensation
law
in
effect,
a
longshoreman
would
sue
his
stevedore
employer
in
negligence.
the
amount
he
could
recover,
if
he
could
prove
negligence
was
without
limit
but
he
had
to
prove
negligence.
on
the
other
hand,
the
employer
had
certain
defenses
with
negligence
of
a
fellow
servant,
assumption
of
risk
and
his
other
common
law
defenses.
so
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
as
a
compensation
act
stripped
those
defenses
from
the
employer
but
in
turn
put
a
ceiling
upon
his
obligation
to
his
employee.
he
said
how
much
in
compensation
he
would
have
to
pay
for?
now,
on
the
employee's
side,
he
gave
up
something,
an
unlimited
recovery
but
in
turn,
he
--
he
received
something
and
namely,
a
right
to
receive
compensation
without
regard
to
fault.
so
that
negligence
was
removed
from
the
field
of
employer-employee
relationships
and
that
was
the
quid
pro
quo,
the
something
for
something
upon
which
the
constitutionality
of
this
act
was
originally
adjudged.
it
is
obviously
a
question
of
fairness
as
to
whether
those
not
in
the
employer-employee
relationship
should
be
brought
within
the
compass
of
this
act
if
they
get
nothing
in
return
for
it.
professor
larson
has
expressed
it
in
this
way.
now,
he's
dealing
not
only
with
this
compensation
act
but
all
state
compensation
laws.
"the
question
here
becomes
very
precise
that
the
compensation
acts
in
conferring
immunity
on
the
employer
from
common
lawsuits
mean
to
do
so
only
at
the
expense
of
the
injured
employee
or
also
at
the
expense
of
outsiders,
that's
the
problem
we
have
here."
one
question
is
that
the
injured
--
one
answer
is
that
the
injured
employee
cut
for
it
quid
pro
quo
in
receiving
assured
compensation
payments
as
a
substitute
for
tort
recoveries
while
the
third
party
has
received
absolutely
nothing.
the
third
party
here
being
the
shipowner
and
hence,
should
not
be
impliedly
held
to
have
given
up
rights
which
he
had
before.
it
is
unfair
to
pull
the
third
party
within
the
principle
of
mutual
sacrifice
when
his
part
is
to
be
all
sacrifice
and
no
corresponding
gain.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
well,
i
think
there
are
several
facets
to
that.
the
first
one
is
this,
that
the
law
requires
the
employer
to
make
compensation
payments
promptly
and
without
any
folderol
unless
the
employer
honestly
controverts
his
obligation
to
pay
compensation.
the
law
requires
him
to
do
that.
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
said
that
if
you
don't
controvert
your
obligation
to
pay
on
the
ground
that
the
employee
was
not
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
they
must
pay
promptly.
that's
the
first
thing.
so
that
in
effect,
the
argument
is,
is
that
we
will
violate
the
law
which
makes
us
pay
promptly
in
order
to
accomplish
another
result.
in
other
words,
there
--
the
argument
is
that
they
will
force
an
injured
longshoreman
to
an
award
before
they
will
make
their
compensation
payments.
now,
once
the
award
is
made,
the
employer
will
have
control
of
the
third-party
suit.
but
the
answer
is,
they
can't
compel
an
employee
to
take
an
award
either.
now,
most
of
these
third-party
cases,
all
of
them
to
my
knowledge
are
all
started
by
the
longshoremen
and
there
is
no
award.
i
don't
know
of
a
case
in
the
last
12
years
where
there
has
been
an
award
because
once
there
is,
there
is
this
assignment.
let
us
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
for
the
purpose
of
discussion
in
this
case,
ryan
had
said
to
mr.
palazzolo,
"true
it
is,
you
were
injured
in
the
course
of
your
employment,
true
it
is,
it's
an
industrial
accident
but
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
a
dime
in
compensation,
you'll
have
to
go
to
an
award."
now
then,
he
has
the
problem.
he
can
go
to
the
compensation
commission
and
demand
a
hearing
and
ask
these
people
why
--
why
don't
you
pay
this
man
or
he
can
start
his
lawsuit
against
us.
the
choice
is
in
the
hands
of
the
employee.
they
purport
to
have
the
choice
by
violating
the
law
but
actually
they
don't.
in
other
words,
they
can
force
the
employee
to
do
something
by
holding
up
his
compensation
but
it's
the
employee
to
make
the
decision.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
the
--
not
if
he
goes
there
honestly,
no.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
no
--
no
penalty
whatever
but
in
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
no,
in
the
mean
time,
the
employee
starts
his
action
against
the
vessel.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
if
your
honor
is
speaking
of
economic
pressures
which
they
might
put
on
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
there
--
no,
he
wouldn't
be
out
of
his
compensation.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
no.
there
would
be
no
award
pending
the
outcome
of
the
third-party
action.
but
in
the
event
he
doesn't
recover
from
the
third
party,
what
he
would've
had
in
compensation,
he
gets
that
from
his
employer
anyway.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that's
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
in
other
words,
once
he
sues
--
in
order
to
sue,
he
files
a
notice
of
election
with
the
compensation
commission.
he
files
a
form
that
says,
"i
choose,
now,
instead
of
taking
compensation,
i
choose
to
sue
the
third
party."
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that's
his
election.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
ryan
can't
force
him
to
that.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that
he
can
either
go
along
with
his
compensation
rights
or
he
can
sue
the
third
party
and
he
says
to
the
commission,
“i
choose
to
sue
the
third
party.”
therefore,
no
award
will
be
forthcoming.
nothing
will
be
done
in
his
compensation
case
until
the
third-party
suit
has
been
decided.
let's
suppose
he
loses
it
and
it's
adjudged
that
there
is
no
third-party
liability,
he
goes
back
in
the
compensation
and
he
gets
all
of
those
rights
he
would've
gotten
had
he
never
started
the
suit.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
oh,
the
limitation
is
for
the
presentation
of
the
claim
through
the
commission
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
--
mr.
justice
reed,
not
for
the
award.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
i
didn't
hear,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that's
just
what
was
done
in
this
case.
you
see
they
continue
throughout
the
years
to
pay
this
injured
man
his
compensation
because
in
honesty,
they
couldn't
go
before
the
compensation
authorities
and
say,
"we
controvert
his
right
to
compensation,
i
mean
no
one
could
put
signature
to
such
a
oath."
he
was
a
man
working
in
the
hold
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
the
roll
of
pulp
comes
down
and
hits
him.
in
theory
perhaps,
somebody
could
go
before
the
compensation
people
and
say,
"we
controverted
but
how
long
would
that
last?"
any
insurance
company
that
followed
that
course
of
--
of
practice
would
be
barred
in
one
fashion
or
another
from
writing
further
insurance
in
the
compensation
commission.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
they
could
prevent
him?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
mr.
justice
clark,
the
possibilities
there
are
absolutely
infinite.
every
case
really
doesn't
have
a
kin.
each
one
of
these
cases
has
other
angles
of
aspects
in
it.
in
one
case
as
in
this,
the
compensation
carrier
intervenes
and
says
i
want
my
money
back.
in
other
cases,
they
have
reimbursement
agreements
with
the
injured
man
that
they'll
get
their
money
without
getting
into
the
lawsuit.
in
some
cases,
they
continue
to
pay
compensation
even
after
a
notice
of
election
to
sue,
as
they
did
here.
in
other
cases
they
don't
but
i
say
that
as
far
as
--
and
i
can't
say
that
in
every
case
a
compensation
carrier
could
not
put
some
economic
pressure
upon
an
injured
man,
i
don't
say
that.
i
can
see
the
possibility
in
some
instances
but
i
don't
know
how
long
that
kind
of
an
insurance
company
would
last
before
the
commission.
if
they
do
not
honestly
controvert
the
man's
right
but
it's
his
election.
he
may
either
take
his
compensation
or
he
can
sue
the
third
party.
it's
only
in
default
of
the
employee's
election
that
then
the
compensation
carrier
has
an
assignment
of
the
claim
by
operation
of
law.
now,
we
come
to
another
aspect.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
i
have
never
had
a
case
of
an
award.
no,
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
i
mean
to
say
this
that
in
any
case
where
i
have
thought
my
shipowners
might
be
involved,
i
have
never
had
a
case
where
the
injured
man
went
to
award
and
then
the
compensation
carrier
by
assignment,
operation
of
law,
came
over
against
the
ship.
i
have
never
had
a
case.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
well,
i
can't
say
how
usual
that
is.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
in
other
words,
that's
a
matter
of
private
agreement
between
the
compensation
carrier,
the
injured
man
and
his
attorney.
in
short,
in
most
cases
as
i
understand
it,
the
attorney
for
the
injured
man
would
agree
with
the
compensation
carrier
that
out
of
the
recovery
he
will
see
to
it
that
they
are
protected,
that
he
will
see
they
get
back
everything
they
paid.
but
in
this
case
for
reasons
unknown
to
me,
the
attorney
and
the
injured
man
would
not
do
that.
and
that's
why
the
compensation
carrier
actually
came
in
and
intervened
in
this
case
and
was
a
party
to
the
judgment.
because
from
a
compensation
standpoint
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case,
the
compensation
carrier
has
got
back
every
penny
he
had
put
in.
but
by
intervention,
barring
this
agreement
which
i
think
is
rather
customary,
by
intervention
becoming
a
party
to
the
lawsuit,
the
final
judgment
directed
that
out
of
the
recovery
compensation
cannot
get
everything
back.
now,
is
that
usual?
i
can't
say
that
with
any
degree
of
assurance
but
they
continue
payment
afterwards.
i
know
sometimes
they
have
and
sometimes
they
haven't.
but
to
say
the
usual
course,
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
they
will
get
it
back
if
the
amount
of
recovery
exceeds
what
the
man's
total
compensation
rights
were.
now,
in
a
case
like
this,
if
the
judgment
instead
of
paying
for
$75,000,
had
only
been
for
--
or
say
$10,000
or
$12,000,
they
wouldn't
have
got
all
that
back.
they'd
already
put
in
above
$13,000
in
compensation
payments
and
medical
payments
and
if
that
was
the
amount
of
the
judgment
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
all
of
that
back
because
this
man
had
further
rights
in
compensation.
he
had
never
had
an
award
for
a
permanent
partial
or
total
disability.
all
these
payments
that
had
been
made
were
based
upon
temporary
disability
of
complete
character
but
he
had
never
had
an
adjudication
of
those
rights.
perhaps,
he
was
entitled
to
another
$10,000
or
$20,000
or
$30,000
in
compensation
and
so
that
if
his
recovery
here
was
about
$10,000
or
$12,000
or
$15,000,
they
would
not
have
got
their
money
back.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that
and
--
and
--
that
i
will
state
in
my
general
understanding
is
--
is
true
that
these
injured
longshoremen
generally
are
impecunious,
not
universally
but
generally.
the
--
how
commonly
the
compensation
carrier
will
continue
on
in
order
to
keep
the
third-party
suit
alive,
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
say.
but
obviously,
it
would
be
to
the
dollar
interest
of
compensation
carriers
in
some
cases
to
continue
paying
compensation
after
the
election
to
sue
because
they
feel
that
keeping
the
third-party
suit
alive
and
looking
at
the
facts,
the
day
will
come
when
they're
going
to
get
all
of
that
money
back
and
they're
going
to
be
relieved
of
any
obligation
to
pay
compensation
at
all,
so
that
in
some
cases
it's
obviously
good
business
to
do
that.
i'm
not
prepared
because
i
don't
have
the
knowledge
to
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
that
is
the
usual
practice.
but
there
is
a
further
factor
too,
the
petitioner
has
taken
the
position
here
that
if
they
do
have
an
assignment
because
the
case
has
gone
to
award,
there
are
no
restrictions
of
any
kind,
nature
or
description
upon
what
they
can
do
if
they
choose.
they
have
pointed
to
some
new
york
cases
under
the
new
york
compensation
law.
i
doubt
--
i
doubt
that
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act,
after
an
award
to
an
injured
employee,
if
there
is
third-party
prospect
that
the
compensation
carrier
can
just
sit
back
and
do
nothing
particularly
in
bad
faith.
if
--
if
they
continue
with
an
action
after
award,
they
are
a
trustee.
they
are
a
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
the
injured
man
and
they
say
that
they
don't
ever
have
to
become
that
trustee.
if
they
have
an
assignment
by
operation
of
law,
they
can
say
they're
not
going
to
pay
any
heed
to
your
further
rights.
is
that
the
law?
i'm
not
satisfied
it
is.
i'm
not
satisfied
that
if
they
ever
tried
that
sort
of
a
thing
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
that
they
get
away
with
it.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
would
not
any
district
court
judge
look
into
the
good
faith
of
that
--
of
that
situation.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
that
would
be
question
of
judgment.
but,
your
honor,
as
presupposing
--
what
i'm
presupposing
that
at
least
the
judge
would
look
into
it.
in
other
words,
that
these
people
don't
have
that
absolute
unrestricted
high
hand
to
do
anything
they
choose
if
they
get
an
assignment
under
operation
of
law.
but
there's
another
reason
why
--
why
that
situation
would
be
looked
into
very
carefully.
in
one
of
the
briefs
submitted
here
by
the
petitioner,
the
insurance
phases
of
the
case
were
pointed
out,
although
they
were
not
in
the
record,
namely,
this
that
the
insurance
company
for
ryan
has
two
separate
obligations.
they
write
compensation
insurance,
cover
injured
employees
and
they
have
a
so-called
1b
coverage
which
you
might
call
ryan's
public
liability,
a
sort
of
a
liability
that
we
have
involved
here.
now,
thus
they
are
in
a
dual
capacity
so
that
if
having
driven
--
unjustifiably
driven
an
employee
to
an
award
solely
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
his
cause
of
action
against
the
third
party,
although
i
still
say
it's
the
employee's
choice.
but
suppose
they
drove
in
their
economically
then
they
say,
“well,
we're
going
to
sit
on
this
because
if
we
start
a
third-party
action
we're
going
to
have
to
pay
under
1b
coverage.”
there
they
are
in
a
duel
position
as
trustee.
now,
i
simply
say
that
if
they
ever
started
on
such
a
program,
i
doubt
they'd
get
very
far
at
least
in
the
southern
district.
i
think
that
any
judge
there
would
want
to
know
what
goes
on
here
because
you
have
a
trustee
with
an
adverse
interest.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
mr.
schwartz
says
they
haven't,
i
have
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
contrary
is
so.
i
will
accept
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
if
they
did
have
1b
coverage
and
that's
what
--
where
we
come
down
to
the
dollar
aspects
of
this
case.
their
insurance
company,
represented
here
by
mr.
schwartz,
paid
out
$13,000
roughly
under
that
part
of
the
policy
which
deals
with
compensation
to
palazzolo,
under
the
judgment
they
got
that
back.
so
now
as
a
compensation
carrier
they're
very
happy,
they
have
been
made
whole
and
though
we
had
an
industrial
accident,
they
have
not
--
to
pay
anything.
but
now,
under
the
other
coverage
of
the
policy,
here
comes
the
shipowner
and
said,
“you
breached
your
obligation
to
us.
all
right
you
took
care
of
palazoolo
but
you
breached
your
contract
with
us.
now,
under
your
general
public
liability
part
of
the
policy,
you
pay
out.”
and
that's
the
way
that
the
twofold
problem
is
--
is
created
in
dollars
so
that
here
we
have
no
compensation
phases
at
all.
those
are
all
behind
us
and
now
we
are
down
to
a
point
of
1b
coverage
in
behalf
of
the
stevedore,
should
that
insurance
company
pay
over
to
the
ship
for
breach
of
the
contract,
i
mean
that's
about
the
dollar
size.
now,
as
far
as
905
is
concerned
and
its
possible
effect
on
the
case
of
this
type,
not
employer-employee
but
strangers.
that
argument
in
our
second
circuit
has
been
worn
out.
our
second
circuit
doesn't
even
write
on
that
subject
anymore.
it
was
argued
here
as
usual
but
the
court
has
written
so
often
and
so
fully
and
i
think
so
clearly
on
this
question
of
the
utter
inapplicability
of
905
that
every
state
court
in
dealing
with
state
compensation
with
having
reached
the
same
conclusion.
our
court
of
appeals
doesn't
even
write
on
it
anymore.
well,
it
was
argued
here,
it
was
briefed
here.
quite
for
a
long
time
now,
they
thought
that
the
matter
had
been
set
at
rest.
now,
we
have
another
problem
here
concerning
which
i
should
speak
very,
very
briefly
and
that
is
contribution
and
indemnity.
says
the
petitioner,
if
indemnity
is
only
a
big
form
of
contribution
and
this
court
has
said
in
maritime
matters
you
can't
have
any
contribution,
referring
to
the
halcyon
case,
then
of
course
indemnity
should
die
too.
what's
wrong?
well,
that's
the
major
premise.
we
might
say
from
a
grammatical
standpoint
or
an
oratorical
standpoint
that
you
can
express
it
from
those
words
but
they're
too
separate
and
distinct
subjects,
they
arise
from
different
sources
and
they
result
in
entirely
different
results.
contribution
means
that
several
people
owing
a
common
annuity
to
the
injured
man
have
to
pay
their
aliquot
share.
indemnity
simply
means
the
making
whole
of
someone.
now,
contribution,
generally
speaking,
depends
upon
a
legislative
will.
contribution
is
not
ordinarily
the
result
of
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
function.
this
court
pointed
it
out
very
clearly
in
halcyon.
there's
no
such
thing
as
contribution
as
an
old
common
law
principle.
we
find
statutes
in
modern
days
in
the
various
states
now
giving
contribution
on
joint
tortfeasors
but
it's
the
legislature
that
speaks.
as
this
court
said,
common
law
courts
are
very
reluctant
to
create
that
new
right
of
contribution
and
said
if
you
want
contribution,
this
aliquot
share
business,
go
to
the
legislature
before
you
get
it.
but
indemnity
has
never
depended
upon
the
legislative
will.
that's
been
a
part
of
our
common
law
from
the
beginning,
we've
always
has
that.
we're
not
here
asking
the
court
to
come
up
with
some
new
right.
we're
asking
the
court
to
go
along
with
the
right
that's
always
existed.
sixty
years
ago,
1895,
in
washington
gas
light,
this
court
recognized
that
the
common
law
right
of
indemnity,
not
contribution,
indemnity
was
even
then
an
old
doctrine.
that
it
had
been
applied
in
all
the
manner
of
cases
in
order
to
work
out
a
proper
solution
of
a
problem
as
between
two
persons,
each
of
whom
may
have
been
wrong
to
a
degree.
contribution
of
course
can
only
arise
from
a
tort,
two
or
more
people
owing
the
plaintiff
a
duty
that
injured
him.
on
the
other
hand,
indemnity
may
arise
from
a
contract,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case
or
it
can
arise
from
tort.
the
courts
have
said
that
if
in
effect
one
of
the
parties
can
be
held
partially
at
fault.
in
a
negative
way,
they
failed
to
discover
such
things
as
we
have
in
this
case.
the
primary
actor
can
be
made
to
indemnify,
isn't
anything
new
in
the
law
on
that.
it's
somewhat
analogous
to
the
collision
cases
in
this
way.
that
if
you
find
one
vessel
with
enormous
fault
and
you
find
a
little
bit
of
fault
over
here
on
the
other
side,
you're
not
going
to
go
half
damage,
you're
going
to
throw
out
a
little
fault.
and
in
a
sense,
the
old
law
of
indemnity
which
is
applied
both
on
the
land
and
the
sea
has
that
sort
of
a
thought
behind
it.
now,
as
questions
were
being
put
yesterday
and
my
learned
adversary
was
answering
them,
it
came
to
my
mind,
something
i
haven't
put
in
the
briefs
or
something
that
i'd
refer
to
the
citation,
the
case.
but
when
mr.
justice
cardozo
sat
on
our
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
he
wrote
an
opinion
in
a
case
that
sort
have
become
all
casebook
case
called
palsgraf
against
the
long
island
railroad.
and
then
mr.
justice
cardozo
wrote
in
effect,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
negligence
in
the
air
so
to
speak.
one
must
always
make
the
inquiry
to
whom
is
the
obligation
hold.
there
isn't
any
such
thing
as
an
act
of
being
simply
negligent.
the
question
is
whose
acts
was
(inaudible)
now,
when
we
apply
that
theory,
that
fundamental
proposition
to
this
case,
the
error
that
persisted
in
the
trial
and
in
the
resolution
of
the
problem
between
shipowner
and
stevedore,
i
think
this
manifest.
why?
judge
inch
called
shipowner
and
stevedore
joint
tortfeasors.
what
duty
in
negligence
did
ryan
owe
palazzolo
and
the
answer
is
none.
they
couldn't
have
been
negligent
as
to
palazzolo.
their
relationship
to
palazzolo
has
been
removed
from
the
realm
of
negligence,
where
the
very
legislation
we're
talking
about
here.
you
can't
say
ryan
is
negligent
as
to
palazollo.
because
they
don't
owe
him
any
duty
of
care,
the
statute
--
that's
all
they
have
to
do
is
pay
him
compensation
so
that
when
you
can't
be
a
tortfeasor
it
becomes
manifest.
i
think
it
becomes
manifest
that
there
was
that
fundamental
error
in
the
case
if
--
because
that
was
the
basis
of
the
denial
of
our
right
to
indemnity
that
we
were
joint
tortfeasors
of
the
scope
of
appellate
review.
i
think
it
is
important
because
the
judge
did
not
find
properly
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
they
were
joint
--
we
were
joint
tortfeasor.
he
put
a
legal
label
on
the
relationship
of
the
parties.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
it
has
that
ultimate
effect.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
well,
whether
it's
a
violation
of
the
negligence
or
the
effect
of
it
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
oh,
i'm
sure
it
does.
except
on
the
most
--
well,
let's
see
if
we
went
on
a
completely
academic
proposal
to
it
that
might
be
all
right
but
to
assert
a
right
without
a
remedy
and
say
that
the
right
continues
to
exist,
i
don't
think
has
any
practical
impact.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
what
duty
of
care
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
does
it
exist?
what
duty
of
care
is
owed
by
an
employer
to
his
employee?
negligence
is
out
and
negligence,
i've
always
thought
was
something
that
referred
to
a
duty
of
care.
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act,
no
stevedore
employer
owes
any
degree
of
care
to
his
employee.
if
he
procures
the
payment
of
compensation,
he
can
be
careless
in
the
abstract
or
concrete
or
any
other
one.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
well,
in
the
criminal
field
he
would
under
the
--
the
example
your
honor
has
--
has
given
me.
but
in
the
civil
field,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
he
can
be
negligent
to
a
man
where
negligence
has
been
taken
out
of
the
relationship.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
no,
they
would
not
have
been
since
this
court
spoke
in
halcyon.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
up
until
that
time
this
court
wrote
in
the
halcyon
case,
contribution
was
very
commonly
granted
in
various
districts
of
the
united
states,
but
this
court
has
decided
that
in
a
case
involving
a
maritime
court
and
in
the
contribution
it
would
be
discussing
an
underlying
maritime
court.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
i
didn't
hear,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
because
i
still
think
that
i
have
a
right
under
the
law
of
active
and
passive,
primary
and
secondary
fault,
even
in
the
lower
court
i
have
a
right
of
indemnity.
that
what
this
court
did
was
to
rule
out
contribution,
put
indemnity
as
just
a
different
sort
of
an
animal
and
that
therefore
when
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
decided
this
on
two
basis.
they
took
court
is
one
basis
for
giving
me
my
relief
and
they
took
contract
as
the
other.
and
i
say
frankly,
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
recovery
on
either
one.
well,
in
my
approach
to
it,
i
have
always
approached
this
from
the
standpoint
of
contract
because
it
seems
to
me,
at
least
to
my
own
mind,
to
make
the
whole
picture
look
clearer.
because
here
we
have
a
stevedore,
an
expert
that
breached
their
contract,
that's
admitted,
and
what's
the
result
of
it?
their
breach
of
contract
results
in
they
--
or
their
compensation
carrier
getting
$13,000
back
and
paying
nothing.
in
other
words,
they
profit
from
this
sort
of
a
situation.
certainly,
it
was
an
industrial
acts
that
happened
in
the
course
of
employment
and
one
would
expect
the
employer
to
pay
the
$13,000.
but
if
i
don't
get
indemnity
in
this
case
then
they
have
actually
profited
because
they
did
a
bad
job
at
georgetown
and
they
breached
their
contract,
it
comes
out
in
dollars.
they
are
$13,000
ahead
in
this
case
because
they
breached
their
contract
and
gave
as
a
bad
stow
at
georgetown.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes,
because
he
has
two
coverages,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes,
because
he's
--
he's
got
a
relationship
with
two
different
people
and
he's
got
two
different
kinds
of
insurance
coverage.
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
yes.
he's
--
mr.
edward
j.
behrens
no,
as
far
as
that
goes,
mr.
justice
clark,
he
is
fully
protected
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
and
you
say
the
$13,000
was
the
full
measure
he
have
to
pay
under
that
act
and
he's
been
protected.
palazzolo
could
not
get
anything
other
than
the
act
said
but
that
doesn't
protect
him
under
his
1b
with
his
relationships
with
the
rest
of
the
world,
his
landlord,
his
contractors
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
in
short,
as
between
employer-employee
which
i
have
said
in
my
view
is
all
that
congress
intended
to
legislate
about.
as
far
as
employer-employee
is
concerned,
this
case
indicates
all
of
the
protection
and
so
on
and
so
forth
that
ryan
has
received
under
the
law
and
the
rights
that
palazzolo
had
under
the
law.
those
case
--
those
parts
of
the
case
have
all
been
removed
and
now
we're
left
--
what
about
strangers?
what
about
shipowner?
what
about
the
member
of
the
crew
having
been
hurt
and
suing
the
shipowner?
what
about
the
ships
cleaner
having
been
hurt
by
the
stow
and
so
on?
we're
off
into
that
field
now
and
because
they
took
care
of
palazollo,
does
that
mean
they
can
give
me
a
bad
stow.
then
one
of
the
members
of
my
crew
comes
along,
the
stow
falls
down,
bangs
him
up,
he
sues
me
under
the
jones
act
for
the
bad
stow,
a
page
judgment
and
ryan
says,
“yes,
i
gave
you
bad
stow
but
i
don't
pay
you
anything.
because
why?
i
complied
with
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
as
is
good
to
my
employees.”
as
i
say,
i
--
i
felt
from
the
beginning
that
this
case
has
those
two
separate
and
distinct
lines
of
obligation.
i
think
that
the
insurance,
the
phases
of
the
case
as
we've
discussed
have
indicate
that
very
thing
that
there
is
coverage
for
corporate
sinners
and
other
kind
of
a
coverage.
and
we're
talking
about
the
other
kind
of
coverage
here.
i
feel
that
i
have
expressed
generally
my
views
or
perhaps
did
supplement
slightly
what
i
have
written
in
my
briefs.
and
i
am
sure
the
court
will,
after
study,
do
justice
in
the
premises.
