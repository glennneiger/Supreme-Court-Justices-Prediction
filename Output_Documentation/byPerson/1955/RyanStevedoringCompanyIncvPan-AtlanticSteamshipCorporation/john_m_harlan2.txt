supposing
your
--
supposing
the
stevedore's
claim
had
rested
entirely
on
--
on
unseaworthiness
theory
and
the
jury
has
brought
in
a
verdict
solely
only
on
a
complaint
of
that
kind
or
a
special
verdict
exonerating
the
shipowner's
of
negligence
if
it
find
the
stevedore
on
unseaworthiness.
what
would
be
your
position
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
the
jury
had
found
no
negligence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
both
issues
are
submitted
there
as
to
bring
in
special
verdicts.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
they
reject
the
claim
of
negligence
and
find
for
the
stevedore
on
the
theory
of
unseaworthiness
which
is
without
fault.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
if
the
injured
person
here
has
been
an
employee
of
another
shipping
company,
nobody
would
contend
that
the
statute
would
bar
claims
against
ryan
on
indemnity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
another
shipping
company,
he's
not
been
ryan
employee.
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
with
the
statute
barring
that
kind
of
a
claim.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
position
is
that
the
circumstances
that
he
is
an
employee
of
the
same
company
doesn't
change
the
nature
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
your
claim.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
there's
any
real
difference
between
the
character
of
the
negligence
as
were
lied
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
character
of
negligence
is
surrounded
by
judge
inch?
isn't
the
court
of
appeals
just
putting
a
label
on
what
judge
inch
found
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
there's
a
change
in
--
a
change
of
his
findings
in
the
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask,
mr.
schwartz
--
may
i
ask
a
question,
chief
justice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
understood
something
that
you
said.
do
you
agree
that
if
there
is
nothing
more
than
passive
negligence
involved
here,
only
want
to
use
that
term,
on
the
part
of
pan-atlantic
that
there
would
be
a
right
of
recovery
over
contribution
by
way
of
contribution
or
indemnity
leaving
out
the
statute
provision?
