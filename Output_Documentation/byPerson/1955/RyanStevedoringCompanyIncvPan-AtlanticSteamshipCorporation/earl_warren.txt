chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ryan
stevedoring
company
versus
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
mr.
behrens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
behrens,
there's
an
intimation
here
that
to
sustain
your
position
would
change
the
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
in
that,
the
employer
would
have
charge
of
the
litigation
if
he
should
go
to
a
-
to
an
order
of
the
commission
before
he
made
any
payments
and
that
--
that
if
he
could
not
be
liable
otherwise
and
if
he
could
control
the
litigation,
that
perhaps
he
wouldn't
be
as
--
as
free
to
make
these
voluntary
payments
as
he
would
under
the
other
construction
of
the
--
the
act.
what
--
what
have
you
to
say
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
penalty
against
the
employer
if
he
does
go
to
an
award?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
say
--
let's
say
he
just
--
just
said,
well,
we
controverted
and
we
want
a
hearing
and
we
want
--
we
want
to
determine
--
want
to
determine
by
the
commission
whether
we're
liable.
and
suppose
the
commission
finds
that
he
is
entitled
to
an
award.
is
there
any
penalty
against
the
employer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
he
could
do
it
but
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i'm
thinking
of
this,
suppose
--
suppose
in
the
mean
time,
the
employee
did
file
a
suit
then
he'd
be
out
on
his
compensation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
an
award?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
a
subsequent
award?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
that
--
that
answered
my
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
have
under
the
--
under
the
statute
the
right
to
settle
litigation
as
well
as
to
go
to
judgment,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
not
settle
for
the
amount
that
they
have
coming
and
forget
about
the
rights
of
the
injured
employee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
have
to
--
if
a
company
has
put
$25,000,
well
say
into
compensation,
would
the
district
judge
say,
“no,
i
think
jury
would
give
$35,000
so
there'd
be
$10,000
left
over
to
--
for
the
employee,”
or
would
he
say,
“well,
it
was
settled
for
$25,000,
why
--
maybe
that's
reasonable?"
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
ryan
have
1b
coverage
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
whole.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
