justice

mr.
westwood,
before
you
sit
down
i
take
it
you
will
deal
with
the
question
that's
implied
in
your
remark
a
minute
ago
a
fortiori
to
the
civil
aeronautics
act
implying
of
course
that
the
scope
and
gamut
of
--
of
outlaw
--
of
the
criteria
of
outlaw
activity
is
not
identical
to
a
difference
and
in
favor
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
will
you
deal
with
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
i
have
to
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
westwood,
and
i
think
i
can
make
it
concrete
because
there's
a
great
danger
of
getting
off
from
the
vagueness
in
here
and
not
on
what
(inaudible)
at
least
what
i'm
doing.
i
can
make
it
concrete
by
referring
to
a
bill
that's
just
been
introduced
into
the
house
of
congress
similar
to
our
federal
state
commission
which
calls
for
the
establishment
of
a
court
to
determine
when
a
contract
in
the
state
of
trade
is
in
the
public
interest,
that's
the
phrase
in
this
english
legislation
and
that
is
made
without
any
(inaudible)
is
now
gone,
without
any
--
isn't
answered
by
it,
a
matter
for
judicial
determination.
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
is
public
interest
in
411,
let
alone
the
federal
trade
commission,
411,
is
the
issue
of
public
interest
one,
which
is
without
qualification
a
matter
for
judicial
determination
or
is
public
interest
a
criterion
and
guide
for
determination
for
application
by
the
--
by
the
commission
subject
to
criteria
which
must
be
satisfied
by
them.
now,
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
me
whether
the
court
is
to
determine
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
de
novo
as
it
were,
what
is
public
interest
or
whether
it
be
an
issue
to
say
like
other
delegated
authorities,
if
you
apply
the
wrong
criterion
in
discharging
your
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
have
the
greatest
trouble
if
it
was
that
because
by
whether
it's
important
to
be
guided
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
in
the
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
difficulty?
what
--
what
then
is
your
--
where
do
you
think
the
court
below,
that's
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district,
had
gone
wrong
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
merely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
we
can
all
agree
that
negatively
speaking,
the
public
interest
is
not
satisfied,
it's
the
effect
of
what's
been
complained
of
is
exhausted
by
merely
one
person
and
doesn't
travel
or
one
--
one
individual
or
one
enterprise
and
doesn't
travel
outside,
although
one
--
one
insist
such
as
a
monopolistic
airline,
it
might
be
a
public
interest
and
go
the
distance
in
discharging
a
function
beyond
its
own
proper
forum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
it
that's
one
of
the
troubles
in
the
klesner
case
that
we're
dealing
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
the
suggestion
that
no
question
of
confusion
is
within
the
competence
of
the
aeronautics
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
question
of
confusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
evidence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
issue
of
confusion
you
say
is
outside
the
competence
of
411
before
the
--
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
--
i
hope
that
your
classes
don't
think
because
the
case
is
dated
1929
it
needs
to
be
freshened
up.
