mr.
howard
c.
westwood
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
reversed
an
order
entered
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
the
civil
aeronautics
act
provides
for
judicial
review
of
c.a.b.
orders
by
courts
of
appeals.
the
order
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
was
entered
on
--
against
the
respondent
here,
north
american
airlines,
under
section
411
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
section
411
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
our
brief.
our
brief
is
the
--
the
yellow
cover.
that
section
provides
that
the
board,
may
either
on
its
own
initiative
or
on
complaint
by
an
air
carrier,
if
it
considers
that
such
action
by
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
investigate
and
determine
whether
an
air
carrier
has
been
or
is
engaged
in
an
unfair
or
deceptive
practice
or
unfair
method
of
competition.
then,
if
after
notice
and
hearing
it
is
found
that
that
--
that
an
air
carrier
has
been
engaged
in
such
practice
or
method
of
competition,
it
is
provided
that
the
board
shall
order
the
carrier
to
cease
and
desist
therefrom.
preliminarily,
i
should
say
that
section
411
appears
in
the
context
of
an
elaborate
regulation
of
common
carriers
by
air,
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
which
is
modeled
generally
on
titles
1
and
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
which
is
administered
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
now,
section
411
as
your
honors
will
recognize
is
generally
similar
to
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
is
set
forth
in
pertinent
part
in
the
footnote
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
now,
the
case
arose
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board
in
this
way.
the
respondent,
north
american
airlines,
is
a
common
carrier
by
air
as
is
the
petitioner,
american
airlines,
both
subject
to
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
the
respondent
had
operating
authority
issued
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
in
the
name
in
which
it
--
which
it
formally
held,
that
is
twentieth
century
airlines,
authority
issued
to
it
in
that
name
back
about
1947.
about
four
years
later,
the
respondent
began
using
the
fictitious
name
north
american
airlines.
about
a
year
after
that
in
1952,
it
advised
--
it
changed
its
name
formally
to
north
american
airlines,
advised
the
civil
aeronautics
board
of
the
change
in
name
and
suggested
that
its
operating
authority
should
be
amended
accordingly
from
twentieth
century
to
north
american
airlines.
now,
pursuant
to
a
procedure,
which
is
described
in
our
briefs
and
which
i
shan't
go
into
here,
the
petitioner,
american
airlines,
filed
with
the
civil
aeronautics
board
a
memorandum
complaining
that
the
adoption
by
the
respondent
of
the
name
north
american
airlines
was
causing
the
public
to
become
seriously
confused
as
to
the
identity
of
american
airlines
and
north
american
and
misleading
the
public
into
the
belief
that
north
american
was
the
same
as
american
airlines.
and
in
the
memorandum
it
was
pointed
out
as,
of
course,
the
board
knew
that
the
two
carriers
in
fact
did
compete
directly
on
one
of
the
principal
air
routes
of
the
nation
that
is
between
new
york,
chicago
and
los
angeles.
affidavits
were
submitted
by
the
--
by
american
airlines,
the
petitioner
here,
in
support
of
its
memorandum
filed
with
the
board.
the
board
considered
the
matter
and
then
entered
an
order
instituting
a
proceeding
under
section
411
and
set
the
matter
down
for
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
respondent
in
engaging
in
air
transportation
under
the
name
north
american
was
engaged
in
an
unfair
practice
or
unfair
method
of
competition
because
of
the
confusion
caused
to
the
public.
the
matter
was
set
for
hearing
by
the
board
before
one
of
its
examiners.
the
petitioner
here,
american,
became
a
party
to
the
proceeding.
numerous
witnesses
were
heard,
some
16
in
all
and
there
was
received
by
the
examiner
at
the
hearing
also
documentary
evidence
and
by
stipulation
of
the
parties
other
documentary
records
of
the
board
were
incorporated
into
the
record.
in
due
course,
the
examiner
rendered
his
initial
decision.
in
that
decision,
he
made
extensive
findings
of
fact.
he
found
that
there
was
indeed
very
substantial
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
public
due
to
the
similarity
in
the
names
between
the
two
carriers.
he
found
that
american
airlines
had
been
operating
under
the
name
american
for
some
20
or
25
years,
that
the
public
had
become
familiar
with
that
name
and
had
identified
when
that
--
the
name
american
airlines
is
used
in
connection
with
air
transportation,
had
identified
it
as
meaning
this
particular
carrier
and
that
the
respondent
in
--
in
the
use
of
the
name
north
american
airlines,
had
created
a
situation
whereby
the
public
was
led
to
believe
that
somehow
or
other
the
two
carriers
were
either
one
and
the
same
or
somehow
affiliated.
and
he
recommended
that
the
board
enter
a
cease
and
desist
order
substantially
in
the
form
ultimately
adopted
by
the
board
which
would
require
that
the
respondent
cease
engaging
in
air
transportation
under
the
name
north
american
or
any
other
name
involving
the
use
of
the
word
american.
exceptions
were
filed
by
the
respondent.
the
matter
was
briefed
and
argued
to
the
board.
the
board
adopted
many
of
the
examiners
findings,
which
indeed
were
set
forth
as
an
appendix
to
its
opinion
and
made
additional
findings
of
fact
of
its
own,
which
in
the
main
were
directed
to
various
exceptions
that
the
respondent
had
filed
with
the
board.
the
--
those
findings
bring
out
the
facts,
some
of
--
most
of
which
had
been
dealt
with
by
the
examiner
that
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
people
coming
up
to
ticket
offices
thinking
that
the
two
carriers
were
the
same,
trying
to
check-in
with
the
wrong
carrier
as
a
result
of
the
similarity
of
names,
people
meeting
airplanes
at
the
wrong
place,
people
calling
the
wrong
carrier
for
reservations,
people
claiming
baggage
at
the
wrong
counter
and
so
forth.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
no,
there
were
just
the
--
just
the
two,
north
american
and
american.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
that
--
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
manufacturer
of
aircraft,
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
no,
your
honor.
the
findings
elaborated
on
the
confusion,
pointing
out
that
actually
the
confusion
went
beyond
even
the
traveling
public.
for
example,
a
labor
union
having
some
kind
of
dispute
or
grievance
against
north
american
threatened
to
picket
american
airlines.
three
newspapers
reporting
a
robbery
that
had
occurred
at
north
american
attributed
--
or
stated
that
it
had
occurred
at
american
airlines.
tradesmen
dunned
american
for
bills
owed
by
north
american
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
i
mention
that
only
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
confusion
was
extensive
indeed.
now,
the
board
also,
in
its
findings,
found
--
stated
specifically
that
the
public
was
very
much
concerned
with
this
matter
because
the
common
carriers
by
air
should
be
held
to
high
standards
of
service
and
it
was
contrary
to
the
interest
of
the
public
to
be
subjected
to
the
kind
of
misleading
confusion
that
the
record
showed,
that
the
advantages
of
air
transportation,
which
are
speed,
indeed
could
be
defeated
by
the
delays
incident
to
people
being
misled
into
calling
the
wrong
carrier
and
going
to
the
wrong
ticket
office
and
so
forth.
and
it
was
made
very
clear
in
the
--
both
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
and
in
the
findings
of
the
examiner
himself
that
the
action
which
ultimately
was
taken,
was
taken
on
account
of
the
board's
conception
of
the
interest
of
the
public
in
the
matter
and
not
simply
to
vindicate
such
private
interest
as
american
airlines
might
or
might
not
have
in
the
dispute.
and
so,
the
board
entered
the
cease
and
desist
order
to
which
i
have
referred.
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
by
a
pre-hearing
conference
in
that
court,
the
issues
were
precisely
defined
and
limited
by
stipulation
of
the
parties.
at
this
stage
in
the
case,
the
only
issue
that
really
remains
in
the
case
is
the
first
that
was
set
forth
in
the
stipulation,
and
that
issue
was
whether
the
findings
of
the
board
make
out
a
case
of
violation
of
section
411
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
on
account
of
the
use
by
the
respondent
of
the
name
north
american
airlines.
the
petitioner
intervened
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
stipulation
appears
at
--
i
had
it
right
here
--
no,
it's
--
i'm
sorry,
at
page
307.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
court's
rising
yesterday,
i
just
referred
to
the
one
issue
that
remains
in
the
case
at
this
stage.
that
is
whether
the
findings
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
make
out
a
case
of
violation
of
section
411
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
because
of
the
respondent's
use
of
the
name
north
american.
the
lower
court
held
that
the
findings
did
not
make
out
such
a
case.
first,
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
finding
that
the
respondent
had
adopted
the
north
american
name
with
the
intent
to
deceive
the
public
or
that
it
had
palmed
itself
off
as
american
airlines.
now,
as
to
that,
later
in
the
court's
opinion,
it
relied
on
and
indeed
quoted
the
dictum
of
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
in
the
gratz
case
to
the
effect
that
in
order
to
make
out
a
section
5
case
under
the
trade
commission
act,
it
was
necessary
that
there
be
a
showing
of
fraud
or
bad
faith
or
something
of
that
nature.
the
respondent
in
its
brief
here,
unlike
its
argument
pressed
to
the
lower
court,
agrees
with
us
that
the
gratz
dictum
no
longer
represents
the
law.
indeed
that
dictum
was
long
since
repudiated
if
it
ever
meant
what
had
been
attributed
to
it
and
a
showing
of
fraud
or
something
of
that
nature
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
make
out
a
section
5
case
under
the
trade
commission
act
and
a
fortiori
under
section
411
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
the
next
point
that
was
emphasized
by
the
lower
court
with
respect
to
deficiency
in
the
court's
--
in
the
board's
findings
is
that
there
had
been
no
finding
to
the
effect
that
american
airlines
had
actually
lost
business
to
north
american
as
a
result
of
the
name
similarity.
as
to
that,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
court
was
in
error,
that
the
absence
of
any
such
finding
is
not
a
flaw.
certainly,
since
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
to
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act
in
1938,
the
substance
of
which
was
incorporated
in
section
411
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
a
finding
of
injury
of
that
nature
to
a
competitor
is
not
necessary
to
establish
a
case
of
unfair
or
deceptive
practice
or
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes,
i'll
--
i'll
come
to
that
immediately.
the
civil
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
no,
that
--
that's
all
right.
i
might
as
well
talk
about
it
now.
this
section
411,
while
it
--
its
wording
is
very
similar
in
substance
to
the
wording
of
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act,
does
appear
in
a
context
which
is
quite
different,
we
suggest,
from
that
of
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act.
that
is
a
particular
section
in
a
comprehensive
regulatory
statute
addressed
to
a
--
the
problems
of
a
particular
segment
of
industry,
that
is
common
carriers
by
air,
in
which
there
is
very
complete
and
very
elaborate
administrative
regulation
of
service,
of
routes,
of
rates
and
so
forth,
in
which
there
is
a
special
statement
or
declaration
of
policy
set
forth
to
guide
the
administrative
agency
given
special
responsibility
for
the
administration
of
that
statute.
now,
in
that
context,
we
suggest
that
not
only
is
section
411
as
broad
in
its
--
in
its
conferring
of
power
on
the
agency
as
is
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act.
but
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
section
is
a
part
of
a
pattern
giving
special
administrative
powers
to
the
board,
the
scope
of
section
411
may
indeed
be
broader
than
section
5
depending
upon
the
expertise
of
the
agency
in
working
out
its
--
the
application
of
the
legislative
standard
there
appearing
to
the
particular
problems
of
the
industry.
now,
the
--
the
next
point
and
this
is
my
--
my
final
point
that
the
lower
court
emphasized
was
that
absent
the
findings
of
loss
of
business
by
a
competitor,
findings
as
to
fraud
et
cetera,
the
klesner
case
decided
by
this
court
under
the
trade
commission
act,
meant
that
the
lower
court
--
that
the
lower
court
was
able
itself
to
determine
what
is
to
or
in
the
public
interest.
and
it
arrived
at
the
determination
that
the
findings
made
by
the
board,
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
been
specifically
addressed
to
and
had
spelled
out
its
conception
of
the
public
interest
that
those
findings
failed
in
the
court's
judgment
to
show
a
case
in
the
public
interest.
your
honors
will
recall
that
under
section
411
it
is
provided
and
again
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act
that
the
board
is
to
institute
a
proceeding,
is
to
proceed
when
it
considers
such
action
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
public.
now,
the
--
the
flaw
as
we
see
it
in
the
reasoning
of
the
lower
court
is
that
it
applied
the
klesner
case
to
mean
that
it
could
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
agency
as
to
what
is
in
the
public
interest.
now,
we
have
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
briefs
the
klesner
case,
we've
debated
what
its
present
significance
may
be,
suffice
it
to
say
here
simply
this
that
whatever
the
significance
of
the
klesner
case
may
be
today
under
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act,
certainly
under
section
411,
appearing
in
the
context
in
which
it
appears,
it
would
be
most
unwise
and
we
suggest
contrary
to
accepted
canons
of
statutory
construction
to
apply
that
case
so
as
to
give
a
court
of
appeals
warrant
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
agency,
and
that
the
public
interest
issue
under
section
411
should
be
treated
no
differently
from
the
public
interest
issue
under
other
sections
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
and
as
this
court
decided
in
the
national
broadcasting
case
involving
the
federal
communications
act,
a
pattern
of
administrative
regulations
somewhat
similar
to
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
the
public
interest
issue
has
been
delegated
by
the
congress
to
the
agency
and
its
determination
and
not
a
court's
is
to
control.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
it
is
the
latter
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
and
actually
i
don't
believe
the
klesner
case
was
meant
to
--
to
decide
that
the
public
interest
issue
in
that
context
would
be
the
former.
but
in
any
event,
under
section
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
the
court
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
obviously
was
very
much
affected
by
the
feeling
that
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
have
a
--
what
i'll
call
a
section
5
violation,
which
it
transposed
to
411,
there
should
be
a
finding
of
something
akin
to
fraud
and
it
was
obviously
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
--
influenced
by
the
gratz
dictum
and
that's
just
wrong.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
all
right.
now,
next,
it
proceeds
and
its
opinion
is
not
all
together
clear,
it
meant
to
--
perhaps
it
meant
to
decide
nothing
else
than
that,
absent
fraud,
clearly
the
case
falls.
but
of
course
as
a
matter
of
logic,
it
did
decide
something
else
because
it
held,
citing
the
klesner
case,
that
there
must
be
a
public
interest
and
then
it
simply
said
negatively
there
is
no
public
interest
here
unless
the
record
show
something
more
than
the
record
does
show.
now,
i
can
construe
that
to
mean
only
that
the
court
itself
was
determining
what
is
in
the
public
interest
and
that
it
regarded
the
findings
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
which
spell
it
out
in
very
considerable
detail,
what
the
board
felt
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
it
--
it
felt
that
those
findings
were
not
to
be
taken
by
the
court
as
the
appropriate
definition
but
that
its
--
its
own
conception
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
--
was
to
be
taken.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
--
i
think
that's
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
if
the
klesner
case
--
actually,
in
the
klesner
case,
the
trade
commission,
except
in
its
initial
resolution
in
a
kind
of
a
formal
way,
didn't
even
address
itself
in
its
findings
and
in
the
opinion
that
it
entered
there,
as
i
recall
it
to
the
public
interest
issue.
and
when
this
court
looked
at
the
situation,
there
was
not,
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
in
the
klesner
case,
anything
to
indicate
that
the
commission,
the
trade
commission
was
moved
by
any
consideration
other
than
the
general
community
interest
in
the
vindication
of
private
rights,
that
is
the
settlement
of
this
little
squabble
that
was
going
on
between
the
shade
shops.
now,
that's
what
the
klesner
case
decided,
that
--
that
there
must
be
something
more
than
that
and
that's
all
it
decided.
now,
here,
i
shan't
go
through
the
findings
in
detail,
the
court
can
read
them
there,
abundantly
disclose
that
the
board
was
--
the
civil
aeronautics
board
was
moved
by
a
concern
as
to
the
impact
of
this
confusion
on
the
traveling
public
over
a
very
important
air
transport
route
which
was
not
insubstantial
and
the
court
--
the
board
specifically
found
that
it
was
--
that
it
was
extensive
in
its
impact
and
which
would
have
very
harmful
results,
not
to
the
interest
of
american
airlines
that
is
not
what
moved
the
board,
but
that
it
would
have
very
harmful
results
to
the
traveling
public.
now,
that
satisfies
any
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
i
--
i
think
there
--
i
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
was
--
did
move
the
--
the
court
and
of
course
as
to
that,
there
are
many
types
of
unfair
practices
or
unfair
methods
of
competition
which
have
an
impact
on
private
interest.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
your
honor,
the
--
there
was
a
procedure
which
i
didn't
go
into
yesterday.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes,
your
honor,
and
then
they
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
what
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
they
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes.
you
see
the
board
had
said
when
it
set
up
this
procedure
with
respect
to
changes
of
names,
the
board
had
said,
"now,
if
a
name
is
already
in
use,
despite
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
the
name
in
which
the
authorization
had
been
issued,
we
won't
interfere
with
it
unless
we
find
that
there
is
after
notice
and
hearing
that
section
411
is
violated."
so
that
when
the
application
was
made,
we
filed
our
memorandum
complaining
as
to
the
use
of
the
name
and
invoking
section
411,
supporting
affidavits,
the
board
considered
the
matter
and
instituted
a
411
proceeding.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
you
mean
private
right
of
action?
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes.
yes,
it's
--
as
i
suppose
any
competitor
has
a
private
right
of
action
where
there
is
some
matter
that
might
be
of
concern
to
the
federal
trade
commission
in
many
cases
certainly.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
one
word
only,
the
principal
argument
of
the
respondent
seems
to
be
that
the
issue
of
confusion
as
to
a
particular
class
of
cases
should
be
beyond
the
scope
of
section
5
or
section
411.
i
would
only
point
that
in
a
great
mass
of
cases
under
section
5
and
potentially
under
section
411.
the
issue
of
confusion
is
very
much
present
and
is
the
critical
issue
in
the
case.
