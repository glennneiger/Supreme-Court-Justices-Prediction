the
impression
i
got
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was
that
because
you
were
--
you
had
a
--
naturally
had
an
interest
in
this
as
a
result
of
any
relief
you
got,
therefore,
the
matter
is
not
a
matter
of
public
interest
but
rather
than
a
subject
of
private
litigation
between
you
and
north
american
airlines.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
far
as
i
can
get
anything
out
of
the
opinion,
that
was
the
underlying
philosophy
in
it.
justice
john
m.

mr.
derenberg
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
going
to
ask
you
a
question.
assuming
that
the
standard
of
proof
in
this
case,
the
evidence
in
this
case
had
been
--
has
satisfied
you
in
all
respects
had
--
had
this
been
an
unfair
competition
suit,
american
airlines
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
relief,
would
that
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
the
--
this
was
within
the
competence
of
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
civil
aeronautics
board?
justice
john
m.

under
no
circumstance.
