justice

how
did
--
how
did
you
bring
the
section
411
in
this
case?
justice
stanley
reed
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
a
procedure
whereby
airplane
companies
have
been
--
a
habit
of
getting
a
license
in
one
name
and
operating
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
then
it
was
the
board
who
required
that
that
should
be
equalized
in
some
way
so
that
they
have
their
license
and
the
name
at
the
same
time
or
get
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
north
american
applied
for
that
permission
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
in
order
to
justify
it.
justice
stanley
reed
and
they
--
they
applied
for
permission,
they
used
the
name
north
american
and
you
objected?
justice
stanley
reed
and
then
did
you
file
some
pleading
or
something
saying
this
is
unfair
or
--
justice
stanley
reed
basing
it
on
411.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
--
if
you
--
if
you
should
enforce
it
in
your
point
of
view
lose
here,
you'd
still
have
your
right
of
action
against
the
company
or
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
but
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
determine
what
--
what
is
the
authority
delegated
for
411,
don't
you?
