mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
before
the
hearing
examiner,
he
handed
down
a
decision
in
which
he
said
this
case
finds
no
question
in
the
board's
decisions,
therefore,
one
must
look
for
guidance
to
the
decisions
of
the
court
in
the
application
of
unfair
trade
practices
as
set
forth
under
section
5
of
the
federal
state
commission
act.
we
agree
that
this
case
is
unprecedented.
the
court
mentioned
it
and
so
did
the
lower
court.
there
is
no
precedent
for
administrative
action
depriving
a
person
of
its
lawful
views
of
its
trade
name
as
was
done
in
this
case.
i
may
say
that
while
this
is
the
first
case
of
this
kind,
we
hope
that
it
may
be
the
last
case
under
section
411
or
under
section
5
of
the
federal
state
commission
act
if
such
an
attempt
be
made.
we
all
agree
that
the
law
of
the
case
is
to
be
found
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
klesner
case.
i
have
been
proud
for
the
last
20
years
in
teaching
law
students
at
new
york
university
then
i
came
around
to
mr
justice
brandeis'
decision
in
that
case.
it
established
said
two
things,
two
very
fundamental
things,
one
was
that
there
has
to
be
a
specific
and
substantial
public
interest
before
an
administrative
agency,
be
it
the
commission
or
the
board,
would
have
jurisdiction.
and
the
other
was
of
course
that
the
question
of
public
interest
is
reviewable
by
the
court.
my
brother
in
their
main
brief
and
in
their
reply
brief,
and
i
may
say
we
only
got
the
reply
brief
on
saturday
and
we
could
not
actually
reply
to
it,
go
to
this
length
of
suggesting
to
this
court
several
times
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
is
better
equipped
to
decide
the
issue
of
likelihood
of
confusion
between
two
trademarks
or
two
trade
names
than
was
the
civil
--
than
would
be
a
civil
court
and
if
i
may
say
it
would
be
this
court.
they
talk
about
the
administrative
experience,
the
administrative
skill
as
a
better
judgment
that
administrative
boards
may
have
in
determining
issues
involving
air
transportation.
this,
your
honors,
is
not
such
an
issue.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
and
how
did
it
arise?
part
of
it
was
answered
by
--
to
mr.
justice
reed's
question.
we
lawfully
adopted
this
name
north
american
airlines.
there
was
no
regulation
then
that
we
had
to
get
permission
to
do
so.
subsequently,
this
economic
regulation
was
passed,
we
applied
for
permission
to
use
the
name
and
from
thereon
american
airlines
took
over.
they
filed
a
service
mark
certificate
issued
by
the
patent
office
showing
that
they
got
a
service
mark
registration
based
on
five
years
exclusive
use
of
the
trademark
american
airlines
with
the
disclaimer,
of
course,
of
the
word
airlines
which
was
granted.
i
suppose
it
should
have
been
granted,
although
there
were
other
airlines,
pan-american,
all
american
also
in
using
the
word
"american"
that
that
is
certainly
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
then
they,
from
thereon,
conducted
this
case.
they
--
all
the
witnesses
which
we
heard
were
their
witnesses,
the
lower
court
found
that
the
board
produced
no
witness
whatsoever.
although,
in
their
economic
regulation
they
said
they
had
--
had
many
complaints
about
other
types
of
confusion,
nothing
was
produced
before
the
board.
when
the
case
was
appealed,
the
government
filed
a
perfunctory
brief,
the
main
brief
was
offered
by
american
airlines.
when
the
court
of
appeals,
a
very
distinguished
lower
court,
unanimously
reversed
the
board's
findings
based
not
only
on
the
klesner
--
klesner
case
but
also
on
the
findings
that
there
was
no
substantial
confusion.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge
danaher
used
confusion
in
quotation
marks.
the
government
did
not
apply
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
it
was
only
the
--
the
then
intervener
who
applied
here
and
who
is
here
today.
the
name
of
the
case
now
is
american
airlines
versus
north
american
airlines,
not
civil
aeronautics
board.
in
other
words,
what
we
have
here
is
a
--
the
type
of
controversy
no
different
than
--
for
instance,
mr.
justice
minton
had
--
when
the
question
was
whether
sunkist
on
bread
was
confusing
to
sunkist
on
raisin
or
the
type
of
question
that
was
before
the
second
circuit
when
mr.
justice
harlan
was
there
about
clorets
and
some
other
similar
name
for
chewing
gum.
it
is
true
that
the
air
transportation
involves
a
million
dollar
industry
but
basically
the
question
is
the
same.
we
have
nothing
else
here
except
is
american
airlines
likely
to
be
--
cause
confusion
with
north
american
airlines
and
more
likely
so
than
confused
with
pan-american
airlines
or
the
all
american
airlines
or
any
other.
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
no
--
no
--
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
i
would
say
no
question
of
--
of
likelihood
of
confusion
between
the
names
--
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
--
between
the
names
of
--
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
yes,
i
would
say
that.
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
yes,
i
would
say
that.
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
and
that
was
what
this
court
said
in
the
klesner
case
too.
and
i
have
--
i
want
to
say
this
at
this
point
that
i
have
never
found
a
single
decision
by
this
court
throwing
any
doubt
on
the
klesner
ruling.
i
want
to
mention
that
the
wheelerâ€“lea
act
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
interest
issue.
the
dictum
of
the
gratz
case
to
which
was
--
to
which
reference
was
made
here
simply
said
that
the
federal
trade
commission
was
limited
to
that
type
of
unfair
competition
for
which
there
had
been
common
law
remedies.
and
we
admit,
i
at
least
admit,
that
that
narrow
scope
is
not
true
today
but
there
--
there
was
nothing
in
our
brief
or
say
anywhere
else
that
there
should
not
be
actual
proof
of
deception.
i
want
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
further
language
in
the
hearing
officers
at
this
issue
which
was
affirmed
by
the
board
and
it
begins
at
page
190.
this
i
believe
and
suggest
strikingly
shows
that
this
board
and
certainly
the
hearing
examiner
did
not
have
that
expert
knowledge
that
is
required
to
decide
complicated
questions
of
unfair
competition
and
trademark
infringement.
that
is
what
judge
danaher
said
below,
he
said
he
could
not
believe
that
congress
intended
to
remove
all
that
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
court
and
have
the
civil
aeronautics
board
pass
on
issues
of
trademark
infringement.
your
honors
will
find
some
very
startling
statements
made
here
on
page
191
of
the
casebook.
the
hearing
examiner
refers
to
a
statute
of
unfair
competition,
giving
american
airlines
a
property
right.
there
is
no
such
statute
to
my
knowledge,
at
least
to
a
federal
statute.
in
page
194,
they
said
that
they
have
a
guide
in
the
word
"american"
regardless
of
whether
other
people
may
also
have
used
the
word
"american"
as
part
of
their
name.
most
important
on
page
197,
there
is
the
one
language
on
which
the
lower
court
relied
and
which
we
rely,
there
is
no
evidence
that
north
american
adopted
its
name
with
intent
to
deceive
the
public
or
trade
upon
the
goodwill
and
business
reputation
of
american
or
that
american
has
been
injured
by
such
operation.
judge
danaher
went
even
further
putting
the
word
confusion
in
quotes.he
said
there
was
no
evidence
of
passing
of
--
no
--
no
evidence
of
actual
confusion
in
quotation
mark,
"no
evidence
that
north
american
advertising
was
intended
to
or
did
entice
american's
passengers
to
fly
north
american."
the
only
question
of
--
and
all
before
the
court
is
whether
there
is
confusion
between
the
two
naked
names.
and
you
--
i
might
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
neither
the
hearing
examiner
nor
the
board
quoted
one
single
federal
trade
commission
case
in
point
because
there
are
not
any
federal
trade
commission
cases
in
point.
all
the
so-called
trade
name
and
trademark
cases
on
which
my
opponent
relies
and
which
are
quoted
in
their
brief
in
--
particularly
in
their
reply
brief
deal
with
actual
misrepresentations.
and
if
your
honors
will
look
at
those
cases,
one
involves
the
word
atlantic
packing
company
for
someone
who's
not
a
packer,
one
oil
milling
company,
famous
decision
by
this
court
that
there
was
no
mill,
one
rejuvenescence
for
a
cosmetic
which
did
not
rejuvenate,
one
a
violation
of
robinson-patman
act,
one
a
question
of
monopoly.
there
is
not
a
single
case
involving
an
issue
of
likelihood
of
confusion
between
two
trade
names.
the
only
one
that
i
have
found
that
approaches
this
situation
is
the
remington
case
where
as
it
said
there,
a
court
did
enjoin
the
use
of
the
famous
trademark
remington
on
closely
related
products.
in
that
case,
it
was
the
identical
name
that
was
used
and
the
court
found
evidence
of
fraud
and
deception.
i
thought
i
should
mention
these
cases
because
the
petitioner
in
their
reply
brief
relies
on
some
of
them.
the
gimbel
case,
they
use
the
word
woolen
for
a
product
that
was
not
wool,
of
course
that
is
deception,
of
course
that's
a
misrepresentation
but
that
is
entirely
different
from
the
kind
of
trade
name
or
trademark
dispute
which
we
have
here.
the
--
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
board
misunderstood
the
law
as
we
know
it
and
as
this
court
has
applied
it
in
trademark
cases
that
unfair
competition
in
at
least
in
three
respects.
we
all
know
today
that
there's
a
difference
between
what
we
call
strong
and
weak
names.
if
somebody
takes
a
name
like
american,
he
cannot
acquire
exclusive
rights
anywhere
beyond
the
very
narrow
scope
in
which
he
may
have
built
up
a
secondary
meaning.
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
several
cases
even
involving
the
word
"american,"
a
california
case
between
the
american
automobile
association
and
an
--
american
automobile
owners
association
where
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
if
you
have
no
better
term
to
use
than
american
association
or
american
express
or
american
company
and
you
cannot
rely
on
too
broad
a
scope
of
protection.
but
apart
from
that,
you
have
--
your
honors
will
have
to
consider
the
product
involved
or
the
servitude
involved,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
board
looked
into
it,
they
don't
cite
a
single
case.
take
the
railroad
industry
or
the
shipping
industry
for
instance,
there
is
red
star,
there
is
blue
star,
there
is
white
star,
they
all
compete
with
each
other.
in
the
--
in
--
in
railroads,
you
have
union
pacific,
southern
pacific,
western
pacific,
northern
pacific,
no
one
claims
that
he's
the
only
ones
to
use
the
word
pacific.
in
our
air
transportation,
we
have
pan-american
airways,
they
fly
from
here
to
mexico
and
we
have
american
airways,
we
have
northwest
and
we
western,
we
have
northeast
and
we
have
eastern,
you
just
cannot
apply
to
straight
--
attest
to
those
cases.
i
think
the
public
is
educated
enough
even
those
of
us
who
don't
travel
as
far
that
some
of
yours
honor
have
to
know
the
difference
between
these
various
air
transportation
facility.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
board's
decision
that
that
point
was
considered.
on
this
question
of
--
of
reviewability
of
the
public
interest,
the
--
my
brother
mentioned
this
court's
decision
in
one
of
the
broadcasting
cases,
they
referred
to
it
in
their
reply
brief,
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is
a
subsequent
decision
by
this
court
in
the
federal
communications
commission
versus
rca
where
the
court
speaking,
to
whom
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
this
statement,
"congress
has
charged
the
courts
with
the
responsibility
of
saying
whether
the
commission
has
fairly
exercised
its
discretion
within
the
vaguish,
penumbral
bounds
expressed
by
the
standard
of
public
interest.
it
is
our
responsibility
to
say
whether
the
commission
has
been
guided
by
proper
considerations
in
bringing
the
deposit
of
its
experience,
the
disciplined
feel
of
the
expert,
to
bear
on
applications
for
licenses
in
the
public
interest."
the
lower
court
towards
the
end
of
its
decision
made
this
statement,
"against
the
foregoing
background,
that
is
the
lack
of
public
interest
and
the
lack
of
confusion,
that
is
relevant
confusion,
we
all
are
confused
at
least
to
the
absentminded
professors
are,
i
have
been
at
the
wrong
counter
quite
frequently
and
i
have
been
told
will
you
please
go
over
there,
you
are
at
the
wrong
counter
here,
that
isn't
anything
unusual.
but
what
american
airlines
did
is
--
the
evidence
they
submitted,
they
asked
their
own
employees
to
make
a
record
everytime
a
wrong
telephone
call
came
in,
everytime
somebody
came
to
the
wrong
counter
they
would
make
a
record
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
so
that
they
could
be
prove
that
there
was
confusion.
judge
danaher,
the
lower
court
believed
and
i
submit
he
was
right
in
suggesting
that
that
is
not
the
type
of
specific
and
substantial
confusion
that
has
to
be
defined
that
that
is
in
the
public
interest
and
a
previous
decision.
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
i
think
this
--
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
well,
my
view
is
that
this
would
not
be
--
that
would
--
this
would
under
no
circumstance
--
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
--
could
be
in
the
competence
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
i
have
been
working
in
unfair
competition
and
trademark
all
my
life
and
i
feel
that
the
question
of
american
airlines
versus
north
american
airlines
or
pan-american
airlines
should
be
argued
before
the
patent
officer
and
before
equity
courts.
and
this
court
in
--
in
the
famous
eastman
kodak
decision
said
this
--
this
much
at
the
very
end,
the
commission,
this
was
the
federal
trade
commission,
exercises
only
the
administrative
functions
delegated
to
it
by
the
act
and
not
judicial
power.
it
has
not
been
delegated
the
authority
of
the
court
of
equity.
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
yes,
and
if
your
honor
will
study
the
legislative
history
and
the
statement
by
commissioner
eastman
and
others
you
will
find
that
everyone
has
agreed
that
the
scope
of
the
section
was
to
be
identical,
almost
identical
with
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
judge
danaher
points
out
below
that
the
type
of
unfair
trade
practices
that
they
had
in
mind
involved
these
ticket
agents,
involving
priority
questions,
involving
typical
aeronautical
issues
but
not
questions
of
trademark
infringement
or
unfair
competition.
that
is
why
i
believe
that
this
case
has
--
is
significant
which
goes
beyond
the
narrow
issue
involved
here.
i
think
at
this
time,
at
least
i
hope
at
this
time
that
we
can
teach
law
classes
that
we
don't
only
have
the
klesner
case
but
we
--
we
would
like
to
have
another
ruling
by
this
court
that
matters
of
this
sort
involving
private
disputes,
involving
issues
of
name
infringement
and
trademark
infringement
should
not
come
within
that
administrative
absolutism
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
in
one
of
his
recent
decisions.i
respectfully
submit
that
the
lower
court's
decision
was
eminently
sound
and
that
its
judgment
should
be
upheld.
mr.
walter
j.
derenberg
well,
they
haven't
so
far
but
--
[laughter]
--
i'm
only
mentioning
that
because
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
klesner
decision
has
been
revitalized
and
denaturalized
in
the
mean
time.
