justice
stanley
reed
made
it
that
the
state,
of
course,
would
have
the
right
to
punish
breach
of
peace
in
the
statement.
justice
stanley
reed
it's
because
of
the
state's
power
to
punish
them.
justice
stanley
reed
are
you,
later,
going
to
discuss
the
theory
under
which
some
acts
are
--
tend
to
interfere
with
the
federal
government's
actions?
justice
stanley
reed
but
all
of
those
were
the
--
the
idea
that
the
state
wouldn't
have
power
under
certain
circumstance.
justice
stanley
reed
it
arise
out
--
it
arise
out
of
interstate
transactions?
justice
stanley
reed
so,
the
state
would
not
have
power
unless
congress
did
give
it?
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
see
their
act
--
act
--
applicability
here.
so,
here
you
have
a
--
well
assuming
that
--
that
it's
against
the
state
that
the
--
that
the
(inaudible)
that
would
be
authority
of
the
state.
justice
stanley
reed
it's
a
state
action.
justice
stanley
reed
weren't
intrastate.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
question
here
whether
that's
a
wholly
intrastate
transaction
or
whether
that
goes
--
they
have
to
punish
or
whether
they
can't
punish
--
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
isn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
i'm
--
i'm
accepting
that.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
i
take
it
that
this
--
here,
the
federal
government
has
said
there
should
be
no
punishment
for
sedition
except
by
the
statute
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
what
is
--
what's
the
difference
between
this
clause
and
the
clauses
of
national
banks,
corporate
national
banks,
kidnapping
and
so
forth?
justice
stanley
reed
not
to
hold
on
national
banks,
there
is
--
what
is
this
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
how
old
are
state
punishments
of
attempt
to
the
state
punishments
of
seditions
or
treason
against
the
united
states?
justice
stanley
reed
and
do
you
disagree
on
that?
