mr.
charles
f.
barber
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
as
counsel
for
the
united
states,
pursuant
to
the
invitation
of
this
court.
based
on
the
study
of
the
smith
act,
its
legislative
history
and
the
precedence
of
this
court
in
the
general
field
of
preemption,
it
is
our
view
that
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
smith
act
to
supersede
or
suspend
the
operation
of
the
state
sedition
statutes.
for
that
reason,
i
am
appearing
on
the
side
of
petitioner.
i
should
add
that
we
take
an
issue
only
--
we
take
a
position
only
on
the
issue
of
preemption.
we
think
that
that
is
the
only
issue
before
this
court,
certainly,
it
is
if
this
court
follows
its
usual
principles
in
reviewing
cases
which
come
up
in
the
state
courts.
we
take
no
position
on
the
various
fourteenth
amendment
issues
which
the
court
below
indicated
(inaudible)
in
his
record.
they,
of
course,
would
be
a
right
for
consideration
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
if
the
--
this
court
reverses
and
remands
the
judgment.
there's
nothing
i
can
add
to
the
statement
of
the
petitioner's
affirmative
case
which
has
already
been
made.
accordingly,
i'll
confine
my
remarks
to
a
few
of
the
questions
which
have
been
touched
on
by
the
court
in
the
course
of
the
argument
and
the
questions
which
are
urged
by
respondent
as
grounds
for
affirming
the
judgment
below.
these
fall
generally
in
three
areas.
first,
the
nature
of
the
federal
interest
which
touches
on
the
material
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
last
questioning.
the
bearing
of
the
fact
that
this
state
legislation
arises
in
an
area
whereas
this
court
has
stressed
the
delicate
balance
is
to
be
maintained
between
the
public
safety
on
the
one
hand
and
civil
rights,
personal
freedoms
on
the
other.
and
finally,
the
effect
of
the
possibility
of
the
so-called
double
punishment
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
questioned
a
few
minutes
ago.
the
federal
government
recognizes,
of
course,
that
as
applied
at
least
to
the
communist
conspiracy,
as
we
know
it
and
as
was
described
by
this
court
in
dennis,
the
national
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
constitutional
government
of
the
united
states
is
supreme.
it
is
paramount
to
any
interest
of
the
state.
it
may
not
be
an
interest
that
is
different
in
kind
because
as
the
attorney
general
in
new
hampshire
stressed,
the
states
and
the
federal
government
in
a
very
real
sense
in
terms
of
the
objectives
of
this
conspiracy
are
in
the
same
boat.
however,
the
united
states
as
the
government
of
all,
and
under
the
constitution,
within
the
range
of
its
powers,
its
laws
are
supreme.
respondent
argues
in
his
brief
very
strenuously
that
it
is
only
sedition
against
the
united
states
which
is
involved
and
not
sedition
against
the
states.
he
presses
this
hard.
he
says
it's
immaterial
at
page
55
of
his
brief,
that
subversion
against
the
united
states
will
vitally
affect
the
states
or
may
bring
injury
from
them,
again
in
arguing
this
problem
of
double
punishment.
he
says
the
case
would
be
different
if
the
respondent
were
convicted
of
sedition
against
this
charge
and
convicted
of
sedition
against
the
state.
this
indeed,
i
think,
i'm
fair
in
saying
is
the
theme
of
respondent's
brief.
technically,
i'm
not
sure
that
his
position
is
sound.
as
mr.
truscott
pointed
out
yesterday,
the
indictment
in
this
case
charges
sedition
against
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
against
the
united
states.
and
the
judgment
below
was
to
quash
the
indictment.
perhaps,
that
puts
an
issue
only
in
the
allegations
of
the
indictment.
practically,
as
mr.
wyman
has
just
argued,
the
proposition
is
unrealistic
in
the
extreme
in
terms
of
the
communist
conspiracy.but
in
any
event,
for
purposes
of
deciding
the
question
in
issue
here,
we
submit
that
it
makes
no
difference.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
power
of
a
state
to
punish
advocacy
of
any
sort
is
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
very
narrow
power.
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said,
in
concurring
in
the
conviction
of
ms.
whitney
under
the
california
statute,
the
power
exists
where
there's
evidence
of
conspiracy
or
incitement
to
permit
present
serious
crimes
or
as
mr.
justice
sanford
said
in
the
gilbert
case,
it
may
be
which
involved
the
minnesota
statute
of
prohibiting
advocacy
or
interference
of
interference
with
enlistment
in
the
united
states
forces.
the
statute
may
be
invoked
simply
in
the
exertion
of
the
simple
police
power
of
the
state
to
preserve
public
order
at
the
time
and
place
of
the
utterances.
for
purposes
of
this
sort
of
exertion
of
the
power
of
the
state
under
these
statutes,
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
formal
object
of
the
conspiracy
is
said
to
be
the
united
states
government,
said
to
be
the
state
government
or
said
to
be
government
generally.
indeed
we
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
congress
to
seek
to
displace
state
laws
where
they
are
invoked
in
such
a
--
a
basic
exertion
of
the
police
power
as
these
examples
are
suggesting.
one
of
the
factors
relied
on
by
the
court
below
was
the
assumption
that
the
enforcement
of
these
statutes
would
be
hampering
to
the
exercise
of
federal
power.
in
our
brief,
we
stated
the
fact
that
in
the
view
of
the
responsible
enforcement
officials
of
the
department
of
justice,
they
have
not,
to
date,
they
have
not
obstructed
the
exercise
of
that
power.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well
--
well
one
--
one
of
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
i
--
i
cannot
answer
that
directly.
i
can
say
that
one
of
the
persons
who
was
consulted
in
this
matter
is
the
director
of
bureau
of
federal
investigation
who
has
held
that
office
for
throughout
the
period
of
the
smith
act.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
is
the
position
to
the
extent
that
we
think
that
there
is
power
in
the
congress
to
enact
any
legislation
which
might
be
necessary
to
make
it
possible
to
carry
out
the
federal
program
without
any
obstruction
by
enforcement
activity
to
the
state
or
other
activities
of
the
states
which
are
deemed
to
interfere
with
the
federal
program.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i
don't
know
that
i'm
to
speak
on
policy.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
i
understood
that
i
--
i
attempted
to
say
this.
that
the
responsible
enforcement
officials
have
said
that
as
administered
by
the
states,
the
state
sedition
statutes
have
not,
in
fact,
interfered
with
the
federal
program
under
the
smith
act.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i
assume,
sir,
that
is
another
statement
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
assume
there's
no
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
and
i
certainly
would
not
hear
today.
i
want
to
say
that
the
policy
was
otherwise.
the
question
to
which
i'm
addressing
myself
is
the
--
the
question
of
law
as
to
the
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
the
smith
act.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
quite
right.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
if
--
if
i
understood
you,
that's
the
point
that
i
have
been
trying
to
make.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
no,
no.
we
would
not.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
of
course,
not.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
but
there's
a
question
of
what
they
can
do
and
what
they
have
done.
it
has
--
the
department
of
justice
has
never
proposed
to
congress
that
it
enact
legislation
to
the
limit
of
its
power
to
preclude
state
activity
in
this
field.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
of
course.
we
are
trying
to
discover
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
smith
act.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
1940,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i've
been
informed
that
the
present
instructions
are
much
like
you
have
described
as
far
as
information
is
concerned.
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
asked
the
state
to
supply
any
information
which
comes
into
their
possession,
which
they
think
bears
on
the
subject
matter.
i
understand
that
by
and
large,
the
states
have
been
very
cooperative
in
supplying
such
information.
i'm
also
informed
that
it
has
not
been
a
two-way
street
in
the
past
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
government
has
not
supplied
information
to
the
state
governments
except
such
as
in
the
public
as
is
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
this
is
a
statement
at
least
as
of
yesterday.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
is
a
statement
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
simply
of
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
the
fact
of
the
last
15
years.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
right.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
except
so
far.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
court
below,
of
course,
made
certain
statements
in
this
area
which
were
what
provoked
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
our
comment
of
fact.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
in
some
instances,
in
these
preemption
cases
where
matters
of
regulations
have
been
before
the
court,
the
court
has
considered
how
the
two
systems
have
worked
as
casting
some
light
on
what
much
and
must
have
been
the
purpose
of
the
legislators
when
they
approached
the
problem.
beyond
that
very
slight
weight,
i
think
it
is
quite
distant
from
the
issue
which
turns
on
the
purpose
of
congress
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
in
1940.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
i'd
like
to
deal
just
one
minute
with
the
question
mr.
justice
black
raised
bearing
on
whether
the
rule
is
different
in
free
speech
cases.
what
is
the
bearing
of
the
fact
that
this
law
bears
very
importantly
on
personal
freedoms,
on
liberties,
on
rights
which
are
basic
in
our
system?
this,
of
course,
was
an
important
factor
in
the
hines
case.
i
think
that
it
might
throw
some
light
on
this
question,
on
this
suggestion,
if
i
characterize
it
as
amounting
to
the
statements
that
the
states
cannot
be
trusted
to
enforce
state
legislation
without
violating
constitutional
rights.
if
i
put
it
in
that
form,
of
course,
it
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
any
state
criminal
proceeding
where
a
defendant
could
be
so
prosecuted
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
as
they
have
developed
under
our
law
that
a
federal
constitutional
right
would
be
violated.
in
this
area,
we
suggest
we
have
to
think
of
the
question
as
concerning
a
constitutional
application
of
these
state
laws.
otherwise,
we
are
mixing
constitutionality
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
the
issue
of
preemption
under
federal
supremacy.
if
we
assume
a
constitutional
application
of
those
laws,
it
may
be
that
we
are
looking
only
at
their
application
in
a
very
narrow
area,
where
the
police
power
is
vitally
at
stake.
i
referred
a
moment
ago
to
mr.
justice
brandeis'
characterization
in
the
whitney
case
in
upholding
the
california
statute.
the
state
conviction
would
not
be
set
aside
where
the
evidence
showed
conspiracy
or
incitement
of,
for
the
commission
of
present
serious
crimes.
when
these
state
laws
are
applied
in
that
area
and,
of
course,
they
have
been
applied
in
that
area,
then,
there
is
a
state
interest
which
perhaps
is
manifest.
now,
we
think
it
would
be
improper
to
apply
the
preemption
doctrine
to
an
area
that
goes
as
far
as
an
unconstitutional
application
of
the
state
statutes
because
i
doubt
that
it
is
reasonable
to
suggest
that
congress
would
have
had
any
such
sophisticated
notion
of
the
extent
of
their
preemption
of
the
field.
i
think
either
they
intended
to
displace
these
state
laws
or
they
didn't.
if
that
is
right,
the
question
is
tested
against
a
constitutional
application
of
the
state
laws
and
i
think
it
would
be
extraordinarily
to
assume
that
congress
would
displace
them
where
they
were
invoked
in
a
exercise
of
this
basic
police
power.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
surely.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
surely.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
cloverleaf
and
there
are
number
of
other
cases
in
the
field.
i
--
i
would
made
this
general
observation
though,
and
that
is,
that
all
of
the
cases
so
far
as
we
know,
where
this
doctrine
of
preemption
has
been
held
to
apply,
where
there
wasn't
direct
conflict,
where
the
court
looked
as
you
said,
to
the
whole
operation
of
the
federal
system,
the
whole
context
of
the
subject
matter
dealt
with
by
the
statute.
everyone
of
those
cases
has
concerned
regulation
of
some
subject
matter.
in
some
cases,
you're
blocking
out
how
far
congress
went
and
how
far
they
didn't
go.
in
other
cases,
whether
they
took
in
all
aspects
of
the
--
of
regulation
dealing
with
a
certain
subject
matter.
but
never
in
its
history
has
this
court,
under
the
doctrine
of
preemption,
displaced
an
ordinary
criminal
statute
defining
in
punishment
and
punishing
conduct,
characterized
as
criminal
which
was
separate
and
apart
from
any
purpose
of
regulation.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
your
national
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
looks
at
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
yes.
that's
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
of
course,
you
must
look
at
the
whole
subject
matter.
we
have
no
other
view
on
that.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
you're
thinking
of
the
double
punishment
line
of
cases.
the
first
one
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
fox
versus
ohio,
i
think
was
the
first
of
that
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
line
of
cases.
that
was
a
state
conviction
for
passing
a
counterfeit
united
states
coin.
it
was
there
argued
since
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
coin
money
that
this
could
not
be
a
crime
under
the
state.
it
was
upheld
as
the
state
conviction
was
upheld
as
a
private
cheat
and
offense
against
the
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
we
don't
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
let
me
use
your
example
in
california
resort.
a
--
a
federal
statute
may
punish
an
assault
on
a
federal
officer.
it
also
may
invoke
a
state
interest
in
preventing
street
problems.
well,
now,
when
you're
looking
at
the
full
--
of
--
at
the
scope
of
the
state
constitutional
power,
this
kind
of
statute
can
be
invoked
and
has
been
invoked
to
prevent
street
problems.
now,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
instance
where
this
court
has
told
the
state
courts
how
to
phrase
their
legislation.
so
long
as
they
confine
the
offenses
they
punish
to
those
within
their
criminal
jurisdiction
and
do
so,
so
as
not
to
contravene
a
federal
right,
this
court
has
let
it
stand.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
for
present
purposes,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
excuse
me
sir
–
i'd
be
glad
too.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
--
in
the
brief,
we
discussing,
yes.
the
point
--
the
point
is
made
that
treason
against
the
united
states
is
something
different
from
treason
against
the
state.
perhaps,
in
the
civil
war
context
of
that
west
virginia
case
or
in
the
war
of
1812
context
of
the
new
york
case.
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
treason
against
the
united
states
government
which
was
separate
from
a
present
substantial
injury
within
the
police
power
of
the
state.
the
southern
states
may
have,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
the
historian
on
this,
but
they
may
have
and
entertained
view
that
the
objective
of
the
war
was
to
overthrow
the
federal
government
without
having
--
and
--
and
impose
their
will
on
it
as
far
as
southern
objectives
were
their
concern.
that
might
have
been
separate
and
apart
from
any
purpose
to
overthrow
the
governor
of
massachusetts.
that
is,
of
course,
quite
a
different
situation
that
we
have
in
these
sedation
statutes
invoked
against
the
communist
conspiracy
where
the
doctrine
is
directed
at
established
republican
governments
in
general.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
no,
but
if
a
person
in
pennsylvania,
in
downtown
pittsburg,
made
a
speech
inciting
treason
against
the
united
states
and
there
was
a
unrest
and
an
outbreak
of
--
of
riot
was
imminent,
i
think
the
states
would
have
the
power,
the
state
in
exercise
of
their
--
or
the
police
power
to
move
in
and
stop
the
treasonable
utterances.
i
--
i
appreciate
there
is
an
overt
act
in
the
specific
definition
of
treason
that
may
distinguish
the
cases.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well
let
me
state
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
so,
let
me
state
two
cases.
if
there
is
a
treason
against
the
state
and
overt
act
within
the
state
looking
toward
the
overthrow
of
the
state
government,
then
it
is
punishable
in
pennsylvania.
but
if
there
is
a
treasonable
act
in
ohio
directed
towards
the
united
states
government,
i
question
whether
that's
punishable
in
pennsylvania.
that's
the
distinction
i
was
trying
draw
with
that
civil
war
analogy
where
there
might
be
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
of
course,
my
great
effort
in
this
is
to
then
is
to
keep
the
two
questions
of
due
process
on
the
one
hand
and
presumption
on
the
other,
separate.
