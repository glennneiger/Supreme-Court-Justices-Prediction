mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
to
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
with
argument
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
explain
one
or
two
of
the
reasons
why
i
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
this
case
and
ultimately
requested
time
to
be
heard
orally.
new
hampshire
was
requested
to
do
this
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
as
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire,
i
have
been
in
charge
of
a
legislative
investigation
as
the
delegated
committee,
so
to
speak,
for
the
last
two
years,
to
determine
whether
there
were
any
violations
of
the
subversive
activities
act
of
our
state,
and
to
report
to
the
general
court.
in
the
process
of
conducting
that
investigation,
one
of
the
witnesses
that
was
called,
filed
a
petition
with
our
supreme
court
asking
that
the
subversive
activities
(inaudible)
new
hampshire
of
1951
be
declared
unconstitutional.
that
act
is
patented
after
the
maryland
over
law
and
is
very
similar
to
the
acts
in
perhaps
15
of
the
states.
it
is
also
worthy
of
note
in
connection
with
this
brief
that
has
been
filed
amicus,
that
every
attorney
general
in
the
united
states,
in
every
state
which
has
a
law
of
any
proportion
in
the
field
of
subversive
activities
has
joined
in
this
brief
with
the
exception
of
the
attorney
general
of
texas,
who
filed
his
own
briefs
which
argues
very
much,
i
believe,
the
same
propositions
as
are
contained
in
the
brief
for
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
in
the
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
there
are
30
states,
your
honor.
and
it's
not
appearing
on
the
face
of
the
brief
by
the
states
of
california,
oregon,
kentucky,
and
vermont,
who
filed
supplementary
statements
with
the
clerk
requesting
to
be
known
as
parties
to
this
brief.
there
are
approximately
17,
i
believe,
in
the
states
that
do
not
have
broad
subversive
activities
laws
in
the
country
at
the
present
time.
our
supreme
court
in
new
hampshire
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe,
your
honor,
because
of
the
inexplicable
relationship
in
our
law
between
advocacy
of
overthrow
of
the
federal
government
and
or
the
state
of
new
hampshire
that
it
may
very
well,
regardless
of
its
separability
provisions,
involve
the
entire
statute.
that
is
a
question
which
ultimately
would
have
to
be
passed
upon
by
our
court.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir.
in
the
argument
of
the
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
i
can
state
it
in
a
sentence
or
two,
but
very
briefly,
our
law
--
our
law
is
very
broad.
it
is
aimed
at
subversive
advocacy.
that
is
the
acts
themselves,
either
teaching,
aiding
or
abetting
the
actual
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
federal
government
or
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
it
is
also
aimed
at
subversive
organizations
as
such
which
are
defined
as
organizations
which
have
for
one
of
their
purposes,
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
either
by
force
and
violence,
if
necessary.
and
that
it
is
also
aimed
at
persons,
who
are
members
in
such
organizations,
but
at
all
times
only
including
the
element
of
scienter.
they
must
be
members
knowing
of
the
subversive
purpose
and
that
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.our
supreme
court
on
january,
i
believe,
25th,
1954,
held
our
state
statute
constitutional.
and
on
that
day,
they
had
filed
with
it
the
copy
of
justice
jones'
opinion
in
the
principal
case
and
a
copy
of
justice
bell's
dissenting
opinion,
and
a
supplemental
memorandum
by
counsel
for
the
original
petitioner
in
new
hampshire.
and
a
supplemental
memorandum
was
filed
by
myself.and
when
they
decided
the
case
on
april
30th
of
1954,
they
had
fully
explored
the
question
of
whether
or
not
our
law
in
new
hampshire
was
superseded
by,
in
their
opinion,
the
smith
act.
and
they
held
flatly,
that
insofar
as
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
purported
to
say
that
the
smith
act
superseded
state
law
that
“we
do
not
adopt
it.”
our
court
in
new
hampshire
has
quite
a
reputation
since
the
days
of
justice
jeremiah
smith
and
chief
justice
(inaudible),
with
an
outstanding
court.
i
think
it
worthy
of
mention
that
there
is
a
flat
disagreement
between
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
after
full
consideration
of
the
issues
in
the
highest
court
of
pennsylvania
in
respect
to
this
issue
of
supersession.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
there
were
state
laws,
your
honor,
in
existence
before
the
smith
act
and
the
greater
body
of
them,
i
believe,
came
into
effect,
subsequent
to
the
smith
act
although,
there
were
a
very
substantial
body
of
laws
not
as
comprehensive
as
the
overact
in
maryland
which
were
in
effect
after
world
war
i
in
respect
to
sedition
and
espionage
in
the
states.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
those
are
the
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
your
honor,
the
law
in
the
principal
case
is
prior
to
1940.
the
law
in
pennsylvania
in
the
principal
case
was
enacted
prior
to
1940.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
were
quite
a
few,
as
listed
and
set
forth
in
(inaudible)
on
the
states
in
subversion.
i
do
not
have
the
various
times
and
dates.
but
none
of
those
laws,
i
believe,
were
quite
as
comprehensive
as
this
overact
in
maryland,
which
was
a
very
carefully
prepared
statute
and
has
been
tested
in
several
of
the
states
and
found
constitutional.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
we
believe
that
there
is
only
one
very
narrow
issue
in
this
case.
and
that
that
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
smith
act
in
1940
superseded
state
laws.
congress
didn't
say
so
in
the
smith
act.
that
much
is
clear.
there
is
no
expressed
supersession.
so
that
the
issue
is
whether
by
implication,
this
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
either
there
is
such
a
conflict
between
state
law
and
the
smith
act,
or
such
an
occupation
of
the
field
by
congress
in
the
smith
act
as
to
require
that
the
court
hold
that
state
laws
are
superseded.
i
believe
it
is
also
very
important
to
point
out
to
you
what
we
do
not
believe
this
case
involves.
this
case
involves
no
issue
of
freedom
of
speech,
no
issue
of
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
the
press.
no
issue
of
whether
steve
nelson
had
a
fair
trial
below.
no
issue
of
any
civil
rights
and
no
issue
of
whether
clear
and
present
danger
is
a
question
for
the
court
or
a
question
for
the
jury,
because
the
highest
court
in
pennsylvania
said,
with
all
those
questions
in
respect
to
this
trial,
we
need
not
now
be
concerned.
because
if
the
principal
and
cultured
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
there
has
been
supersession
is
true,
we
are
out
of
business
in
pennsylvania
and
we
so
hope.
and
that's
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
held.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
not
in
this
way,
your
honor.
no.
and
in
that
regard,
i
think
it's
important
too
to
stress
that
all
these
cases
in
massachusetts,
the
hood
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
(inaudible)
case
in
kentucky
which
occupy
a
recitation
of
facts
in
one
of
the
amici
briefs
of
some
thirty
five
and
a
half
pages
are
completely
irrelevant
to
the
single
determination
before
the
court
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
also
that
the
exaggerated
misrepresentations
of
facts
which
are
made
in
respect
to
what
those
cases
might
have
involved
or
what
i
might
have
done
in
new
hampshire,
which
in
some
instances
are
almost
libelous,
should
not
occupy
any
of
my
time
here
before
you,
because
that
is
in
a
field
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
in
the
case
at
bar
which
is
very
narrow.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
it
has.
i
think
there
is
a
petition
by
all
these
(inaudible)
in
massachusetts
which
is
being
held
up
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
pending
the
determination
of
the
issue
of
supersession
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
not
at
all.
the
purpose
of
congress
in
respect
of
the
smith
act
and
the
evil
which
the
smith
act
was
directed
toward
is,
of
course,
very
important
in
this
field.
but
all
of
these
extraneous
matters
which
tend
to
present
factual
situations
in
an
atmosphere,
calculated
to
cause
the
reader
to
feel
that
there
is
involved
the
(inaudible)
which
is
the
product
of
hysteria
and
which
seeks
to
enjoin
conformity
upon
all
the
people
in
the
country
are
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
issue.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
they're
irrelevant
for
this
reason.because
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
indicated
in
the
first
three
or
four
pages
of
its
opinion
has
--
it
was
printed
in
the
appendix
of
the
certiorari
in
this
case.
that
they
do
not
need
to
be
concerned
with
those
particular
questions
because
they
rule
solely
on
the
narrow
question
of
supersession.
and
that's
why
we
have
the
states
are
here
because
this
doubt
about
whether
there
was
supersession
raised
by
these
two
conflicting
decisions
cast
a
cloud
over
all
of
the
subversive
activities
laws
of
all
of
the
states
that
have
them.
and
many
proceedings
are
being
held
up
at
the
present
time
pending
a
clarification
of
this
issue
by
this
court.
if
this
court
rules
that
there
has
been
supersession
then,
of
course,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.but
if
this
court
rules
that
there
has
not
been
supersession,
the
question
of
whether
rights
or
civil
rights,
or
civil
liberties,
or
due
process
or
anything
else,
has
been
violated
in
regard
the
steve
nelson
goes
back
to
pennsylvania
for
determination
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
and
there
is
ample
indication
in
the
record
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
is
quite
ready
to
deal
with
those
questions.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir.
that
is
true.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe
that
they
are,
your
honor,
except
in
considering
whether
or
not
there
is
a
conflict
or
an
occupation
in
the
field
by
congress.
and
i
believe
that
that
question
involves
the
question
of
whether
congress
here
was
legislating
in
pursuance
to
a
power
which
has
been
given
to
the
federal
government
under
the
constitution.
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions
in
regard
to
interpretation
that
will
be
reached
by
this
court
in
the
event
that
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
smith
act
is
silent
on
the
question
of
intention.
and
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
all
of
the
references
to
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
and
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
are
not
controlling
in
this
matter
because
the
question
is
what
was
congress'
intent
in
1940?
and
the
matter
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
while
it
is
contended
reflects
upon
congressional
intent
in
1940,
in
a
retroactive
sense
over
some
10
sessions
of
congress.
in
albertson
versus
millard
was
faced
by
judge
simmons
in
justice
kind
of
way
and
that
matter
has
been
always
returned
for
further
disposition
by
the
michigan
court
in
answer
to
questions
raised
under
its
own
law.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
legislative
history
of
the
smith
act
is
not
silent.
it's
very
clear.
i
don't
suppose
that
it
could
be
anymore
clearer
than
to
have
had
congressman
may
ask
congressman
smith
on
the
debates
on
the
house
floor.
and
those
are
quite
competent
in,
i
believe,
interpreting
and
reaching
a
post
mortem
reconstruction
of
congressional
intention,
whether
or
not
the
difference
in
penalty's
involved.
whether
there
was
any
difference
in
penalties
between
this
act
and
the
various
state
laws.
and
congressman
smith's
answer
is
set
forth
at
page
11
of
my
brief
was
this
law.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
state
laws.
it's
perfectly
clear
also
that
when
the
house
judiciary
committee
was
considering
this
bill,
they
had
specific
questioning
in
regard
to
the
case
of
gitlow
versus
new
york.
in
the
case
of
gitlow
versus
new
york,
quoted
with
approval,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
gilbert
versus
minnesota,
which
said
that
the
state
has
a
perfect
right
in
its
exercise
of
its
essential
basic
right
of
self-preservation
to
make
efforts
to
overthrow
the
federal
government
its
own
crime.
and
that,
of
course,
is
all
that
has
been
done
in
this
case
by
these
decisions.
if
the
question
should
be
reached,
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument,
that
this
court
feels
that
congressional
intention
is
not
evidenced
by
these
legislative
debates,
as
to
whether
there
was
supersession
by
implication,
then,
i
would
respectfully
contend
it
must
be
found
in
order
to
invoke
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
that
there
was
a
law
enacted
in
pursuance
to
a
power
granted
to
the
states
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
i
have
difficulty
in
finding
where
there
is
such
a
delegation
in
the
constitution
itself.
in
article
i,
section
8,
there
is
no
such
express
power.
this
is
not
a
commerce
clause
decision.
this
is
not
a
question
of
foreign
policy
entrusted
to
the
federal
government.
in
article
4,
section
4
where
it
says
that
the
federal
government
shall
guarantee
to
each
of
the
states
a
republican
form
of
government
to
protect
them
against
invasion.
it
goes
on
to
say,
that
in
cases
of
domestic
violence,
the
federal
government
shall
only
come
in
upon
application
of
the
legislature
of
the
chief
executive
of
the
state.
nowhere
can
it
be
found,
that
there
is
an
express
exclusive
power
in
the
federal
government
in
this
case.
so
that
we
turn
back
to
justice
frankfurter's
remark
which
is
quoted
in
mr.
thatcher's
brief.
i
believe
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
dennis
case
to
the
effect
that
this
is
one
of
the
implied
and
inherent
attributes
of
sovereignty
that
a
government,
all
governments,
can
enact
laws
looking
to
their
own
self-preservation.
so
that
if
you'll
find
supersession
by
implication,
in
the
smith
act,
there
is
in
effect
a
fiction
of
an
implication
upon
an
implication.
we
believe
that's
a
dangerous
doctrine.
that
it's
an
artificial
concept.
and
that
it
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
have
no
such
figures,
your
honor.
there
have
been
very
few,
very
few.
and
i
might
like
to
say
in
that
regard
that
it's
almost
impossible,
so
far
as
i
have
been.
and
my
experience
has
been
in
new
hampshire,
to
get
evidence
in
the
face
of
the
fifth
amendment,
not
the
national
fifth
amendment
of
the
states,
fifth
amendment
which
applies
in
the
state
investigation.
and
nobody
is
talking
about
what
they've
done
after
the
effective
date
of
the
law,
the
state
subversive
activities
law
in
new
hampshire.
and
it's
quite
a
problem.
but
if
supersession
by
implication
should
be
announced
as
a
doctrine
in
a
field
of
an
implied
power
under
the
constitution
such
as
this,
the
test
then
becomes
one
of
whether
or
not
congress
having
occupied
the
field
or
there
being
such
a
conflict
which
there
is
not,
which
the
government
brief,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
at
page
10
says
that
for
15
years,
the
states
and
the
federal
government
had
cooperated
in
this
field
to
the
mutual
advantage
and
mutual
strength
of
both.
and
at
page
32,
the
government's
brief
urges
this
court
not
to
make
a
finding
of
conjectural
hypothetical
difficulties
or
conflicts
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
because
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
cooperation
which
has
existed
for
15
years
will
continue
to
exist
in
the
future.
and
i'm
quite
sure
that
it
will.
then
if
that
implication
is
found,
i
think
it
is
important
to
consider
the
effect
upon
state
laws.
we
are
the
chief
law
enforcement
officers
of
the
states.
we
have
the
duty
of
using
our
state
police,
our
local
police,
to
see
that
law
and
order
is
maintained
in
the
states.
can
it
be
possible,
can
it
be
reasonable
and
hence
good
sense,
that
the
federal
government
should
enact
the
law
which
involves
a
very
basic
question
of
policy
in
the
first
instance
or
the
legislature
and
the
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
making
it
no
crime
in
the
states
to
conspire,
to
advocate,
or
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
can
it
be
possible
that
if
we
know,
for
example,
in
new
hampshire,
which
is
a
small
state,
but
rather
industrially
concentrated?
and
in
pennsylvania,
which
has,
as
general
truscott
has
said,
long
has
been
known
as
the
(inaudible)
of
democracy?
can
it
be
possible
that
we
know
26
people
are
going
to
meet
in
the
house
on
a
certain
town,
on
a
certain
street,
in
a
certain
town
therein
to
either
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america,
or
to
conspire
and
to
do
it
sometime
in
the
future?
that
all
we
can
do
is
to
tell
an
fbi
man
about
it?
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
which
offense,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
he
was
prosecuted
in
both
jurisdiction.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
do
believe
so,
your
honor.
we
have
no
municipal
law.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
we
have
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
political
subdivisions
which
are
referred
to
in
both
the
smith
act
and
the
state
laws
adequately
embrace
any
offenses
against
the
municipalities.
and
i,
in
new
hampshire,
have
superseded
the
county
solicitors
by
order
in
respect
to
subversive
activities,
such
as
state
matter
in
new
hampshire.
in
the
same
sense,
i
would
assume
that
would
be
true
if
a
political
subdivision
of
the
united
states
government
were
to
be
involved.
in
the
hines
--
in
the
hines
case,
the
field
of
foreign
relations
involved
in
express
power
delegated
to
the
federal
government,
no
question
about
it,
the
executive
was
to
make
it
and
there
is
--
they
are
the
occasion
for
restricting
any
concurrent
state
power
to
the
narrowest
of
fields.
in
this
case,
to
say
that
there
is
an
exclusive
power
in
the
federal
government
or
that
any
federal
power
in
this
field
should
be
restricted
to
the
narrowest
of
fields,
is
not
apt
because
it
is
absolutely
impossible
and
i
believe
this
to
be
the
crux
of
this
case.
for
anybody,
in
any
state,
to
conspire
to
overthrow
that
state
or
the
federal
government
or
either
of
them
or
the
federal
government
alone,
with
the
hope
they're
being
at
once
involved,
the
most
certain
offense
against
the
peace
and
dignity
and
security
of
that
state.
if
you
assume,
either
a
conspiracy
involved,
if
you
will,
in
the
dennis
case,
or
an
actual
act
of
advocacy,
aimed
at
the
federal
government,
and
if
you
were
to
assume
that
we
don't
have
to
wait
for
the
pooch
and
if
we
have
to
wait
for
the
pooch,
if
we
don't
in
the
federal
government,
we
don't
in
the
states,
then
if
it
were
to
be
successful,
this
court
would
be
deposed.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
be
deposed.
the
legislators
and
the
senators
from
that
state
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
be
deposed.
the
army,
the
navy
and
the
air
force
would
be
in
the
hands
of
revolutionists
by
assumption,
i
admit.
and
using
justice
hand's
phrase,
"you
have
to
discount
these
things
by
their
improbability,
yes,
but
it
is
nevertheless,
not
inconceivable.
and
were
it
to
be
successful."
and
then
what
about
the
duty
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
the
states
against
invasion?
can
it
be
said
that
it
is
so
remote
that
the
states
are
not
involved,
are
not
concerned?t
his
is
one
of
the
most
basic
powers
that
the
founding
fathers
reserved
to
the
states
and
to
the
people
thereof
under
the
tenth
amendment.
this
is
a
right
and
inherent
attribute
of
sovereignty
because
the
states
on
no
theory,
even
according
to
the
government's
brief,
when
that
speaks
of
paramount
interest
of
provinces
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
by
illustrating
what
happened
in
new
hampshire
within
the
last
three
months.
we
had
a
bank
robbery,
a
federal
robbery
up
there.
and
the
individual
participants
were
apprehended
and
prosecuted
by
the
federal
authorities.
we
have
a
penalty
of
25
to
30
years
under
our
state
law
for
the
same
crime
and
the
same
jurisdiction.
i
asked
the
authorities
in
new
hampshire,
including
the
superintendent
of
the
state
police
and
the
governor,
whether
or
not
they
believed
as
i
believed,
that
the
seven
to
15
years
sentence
which
was
given
to
those
boys
was
sufficient.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
federal
offense
was
bank
robbery.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
national
bank,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
that
is
also
a
state
offense.
and
we
did
not
prosecute.
we
had
it
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
of
the
detailed
laws
of
the
various
states
with
respect
to
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
answer
--
the
answer
is
yes.
the
same
as
true,
i
believe
in
kidnapping,
the
same
is
true
in
respect
to
many
offenses
which
may
involve
a
conflict
of
jurisdiction
or
hold
the
lapping
of
jurisdiction
in
respect
to
penalties.
but
as
to
which
both
sovereign
jurisdictions,
both
sovereign
powers
have
the
basic
concern.
its
like,
i
think,
your
honor,
father
and
mother
live
under
a
house.
father
tells
son,
“if
you
break
the
window,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
whipping."
mother
says,
“i'm
going
to
put
you
to
bed
without
your
supper,
if
you
break
the
window.”
and
if
the
boy
breaks
the
window,
its
completely
within
the
proper
problems
of
both
to
have
that
disciplinary
proceeding
for
both.
and
under
the
constitution
which
the
states
originally
created,
the
federal
government,
we
have
a
partnership.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
sir.
we've
been
--
we've
been
partners
with
the
federal
government.
i've
finished
transcripts
of
the
testimony
i've
taken
in
our
legislative
investigation
and
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
we
have
worked
in
collaboration
in
the
effort
to
preserve
mutual
security.
here
a
person
twice
convicted
of
both
advocacy
of
overthrow
of
this
government
and
the
instruction
even
of
this
court,
comes
in
and
says,
that
to
perfect
the
more
perfect
central
government
and
the
strongest
central
federal
government,
you
should
eliminate
the
states,
regardless
of
whether
that
should
be
considered
in
the
light
of
its
solace.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
they
are
for
prosecutor,
your
honor.
and
we
do
not,
because
the
federal
authorities
by
both
presidential
directive
and
department
of
justice
directive
are
interdicted
from
furnishing
any
information
to
the
state
authorities,
under
the
present
--
the
directives
of
the
federal
authorities.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
cooperation
insofar
has
been
in
the
sense
that
we
have,
unofficially,
had
tried
in
every
event
not
to
conflict
with
the
federal
efforts
in
a
common
goal
of
security.
we
do
not
wish
to
interfere.
we
wish
to
help.
we
have
the
power
of
subpoena,
your
honor.
they
do
not.
that
is
a
tremendous
thing
when
you
considered
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
the
superior
probative
evidence.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
but
in
the
legislative
investigation
to
determine
whether
there
have
been
either
crimes
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
cannot
answer
the
question
because
that's
a
prosecution
and
i
have
had
no
prosecutions
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
prohibition
consist
of
a
directive,
first,
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
not
to
disclose
information
even
to
state
officials
engaged
in
the
same
work
as
to
the
contents
of
their
files.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
so
far
as
--
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
that.
all
i
know
is
that
we
have
certainly
cooperated
completely.
but
they
have
been
prohibited
from
cooperating.
i
have
often
wanted
to
know
for
example
as
to
whether
or
not
certain
things
were
more
probably
true.
they're
not
based
upon
previous
investigations.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
we
do
not
know.
we
have
a
conference
on
the
29th
day
of
this
month
for
the
purpose
of
working
out
what
i
hope
will
be
an
improvement
in
--
in
that
respect
in
the
common
advantage
with
the
attorney
general,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
in
our
nelson
case,
held
that
chase
nelson
was
a
lady
who
was

of
the

party
in

hampshire
for
many
years.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
correct.

judgment

procedure.
