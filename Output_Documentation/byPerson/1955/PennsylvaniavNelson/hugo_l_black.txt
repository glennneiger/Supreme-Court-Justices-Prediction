justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
states
are
represented
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
they
--
why
would
they
be
irrelevant,
they
kept
things
true
if
they
feel
that
much
of
the
activity
or
the
survey
of
the
law
is
supposes
to
regulate.
it
happened
to
be
appealed
in
which
the
government
has
provided
special
protection
in
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
out
of
the
question
now
is
that
--
it's
about
--
that
is
my
mine
that
we
had
some
years
ago
a
case
related
before
in
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
we
had
again,
a
question
relating
to
the
nationwide
registration
law.
and
we
have
there
it
just
happened
to
get
them
in
the
field
of
the
--
of
the
first
amendment
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
those
differences
are
wholly
irrelevant
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
you
could
also
punished
under
the
municipality
for
the
same
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
means
you
have
no
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
would
be
no
reason
under
your
argument
why
there
should
not
be
one
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
why
they
should
proceed
in
the
states
in
connection
with
giving
of
evidence
now
on
cases
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
that
been
the
view
of
the
department
of
justice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
could
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
interfering
with
the
action
in
the
proposition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
i
have
the
full
--
the
statement
made
by
him
distinct
to
any
cases
that
we
believed.
that
that's
the
fact.
the
fact
was
must
not
be
able
to
look
that
meaning
is
by
servitude
an
is
subverted.
so,
the
problem
must
be
handled
on
a
nationwide
basis.
is
that
the
department's
position
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statement
i've
just
read
is
different
from
the
present
policy
of
the
department
of
justice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
were
stating
the
policy
of
the
department
of
justice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
would
this
be
the
present
policy
of
the
government?
this
test
investigated
espionage,
sabotage,
violation,
and
so
forth,
must
be
conducted
in
comprehensive
and
effective
manner
on
a
national
basis.
and
all
information
must
be
carefully
sifted
out
and
correlated
in
order
to
avoid
confusion
and
irresponsibility.
is
that
different
from
the
present
policy
of
the
department
of
justice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
just
for
the
statement
made
by
the
president
some
years
ago.
the
other
one
was
that
i
review
with
the
statements
by
mr.
hoover
of
the
fbi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
seemed
to
be
there
in
the
court
as
i
read
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
demands
national
control,
i
would
suppose
that
you
wouldn't
assert
that
the
attorney
general
vast
as
his
power
may
be
would
have
control
of
the
state
prosecution.
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
make
the
point
that
the
federal
--
department
of
justice
has
the
right
to
control
prosecution
in
a
state
for
the
law
which
is
valid
in
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
if
it's
necessary
that
this
problem
must
be
held
on
a
nationwide
basis,
how
can
you
handle
it
on
a
nationwide
basis
if
all
the
48
states
can
prosecute
for
the
same
thing
without
any
control
by
the
federal
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
enacted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statement
was
made
by
the
department
by
mr.
hoover
in
1939,
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
it
was
1939.
so,
that
would
be
1940.
that
the
federal
state
accept
conference
on
law
enforcement
problems
--
problems
of
national
defense
proceedings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
position
of
yours
challenged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
challenged
in
the
brief?
i
didn't
hear
the
challenge
in
the
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
recall
before
1776,
they'd
arrest
many
people
who
want
to
overturn
the
national
government,
who
had
no
desire
to
overturn
the
government
in
the
separate
colonies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
thatcher,
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
some
municipality
as
you
is
likely
to
(inaudible)
do
you
have
any
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
quoted
the
section
of
the
smith
act
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
section
makes
it
applicable
to
sedition
against
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
draw
any
company
to
the
fact
that
the
constitution
suggests
punishing
despite
it
was
the
same
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
a
state
may
--
may
have
been
held
that
does
not
apply
to
the
state
that
you
would
not
want
to
presume
that
congress
(inaudible)
one
man
punished
twice
with
the
offense
contrary
to
--
claim
their
position
with
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
there
been
any
statutes
heretofore,
passed
by
congress
where
the
(inaudible)
state
to
bring
about
trial
which
was
to
subject
then
to
being
punished
twice
by
the
identical
conduct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
true
in
the
prohibition
by
all,
i
wonder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
--
was
there
anything
in
the
prohibition
laws?
i'm
not
--
i'm
asking
because
i'm
not
--
i
do
not
know
which
indicated
the
desire
on
the
part
of
congress
that
the
same
conduct,
the
same
individual
should
be
and
have
two
punishments
imposed.
one
by
the
state
and
one
by
the
federal
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
did
it
say
that
--
may
--
maybe
it
did.
did
the
act
or
the
constitution
say
or
incurred
the
idea
of
both
prosecuting.
i
understand
that
they're
both
to
be
prosecuted
but
it
would
carry
it
--
with
it
the
idea,
that
if
both
should
prosecute
for
the
identical
offense
so
as
to
guarantee
that
they
would
be
punished
twice
for
the
same
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
was
quite
enough
of
that
as
i
recall
it.
you
have
the
punishment
not
merely
by
the
federal
government
but
by
the
state
and
by
the
municipality
for
the
same
offense
and
that
was
frequently
done
as
i
recall
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
smith
versus
moore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what's
been
quoted
of
the
--
of
what
you
mentioned
is
about
where
the
punishment
was
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
it's
de-emphasizing
that
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
dealt
--
you
--
you
made
that
statement
several
times.it's
not
in
your
brief,
but
could
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
--
you
don't
point
out
what
municipalities
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
filed
by
who?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
brief
did
you
say?
i'll
--
i'll
find
it.
you
go
ahead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
won't
take
your
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
have
been
the
several
instances
in
which
congress
has
referred
to
what's
called
the
finding
and
the
court
referred
to
in
several
instances
of
desire
of
international
communism
to
destroy
the
government?
has
there
been
any
such
finding
with
reference
to
communism
and
destroy
in
this
individual
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
were
there
any
evidence
to
argue
more
in
this
record
that
indicated
that
the
--
this
idea
was
to
destroy
the
state
of
pennsylvania
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
federal
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
would
raise
quite
a
different
question
and
to
approve
--
the
supreme
court
hasn't
said
yet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
what
has
been
here,
your
criteria
for
determining
in
this
court
whether
or
not
federal
acts
displaces
state
acts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
acts
and
their
distributing
literature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
--
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
was
that
same
kind
of
action
in
lovell
against
griffin,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
was
that
kind
of
action
lovell
against
griffin
in
many
other
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
action
of
distributing
literature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
action
--
the
only
action
in
which
you
refer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
--
you
mean
with
literature
or
with
by
voice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
only
action
that
--
that
if
you
call
action
delay,
what
they
said
and
the
distribution
of
literature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
solely
by
the
distribution
of
literature
and
what
they
say.
