mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
is
to
be
next.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
the
federal
government
had
each
enacted
an
identical
law
proscribing
sedition
against
the
united
states.
the
defendant
or
respondent
nelson
was
tried
and
then
convicted
and
sentenced
in
the
federal
--
in
the
state
courts
under
the
state
law
and
subsequently
was
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
in
the
federal
courts
under
the
federal
law.
this
--
this,
of
course,
immediately
gives
rise
to
the
basic
question
here
which
i
agree
with
mr.
truscott
on,
that
the
--
whether
the
pennsylvania
law
is
superseded
or
suspended
by
the
at
federal
law.
however,
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
basic
considerations
of
civil
liberties
involved
here
which
i'll
dwell
on
it
at
length
a
little
later.
one
--
one
such
consideration
involves
the
question
of
dual
punishment.
another
involves
possible
transgressions
of
personal
rights
and
liberties
of
the
delicate
but
very
volatile
subject
to
sedition
is
that
for
enforcement
at
the
local
level
is
subject
to
local
prejudices
and
passions,
and
perhaps
local
political
ambitions.
i
suppose
that
fairness
treat
them
to
even
most
reviled
of
our
citizens
is
inherent
on
the
constitution.
i
have
no
sympathy
with
nelson's
teachings,
but
i
have
faith
and
sympathy
for
the
proposition
that
the
crime
of
sedition
against
the
united
states
should
be
prosecuted
and
punished
by
the
federal
government
alone.
i
cannot
believe
that
congress,
in
enacting
the
smith
act
intended
to
create
a
--
a
situation
which,
an
early
justice
of
this
court
described
as
something
worse
than
oppression.
that
is,
where
under
an
individual
that's
subjected
to
not
only
two
punishments
perhaps,
but
perhaps,
many
punishments
that
municipalities
are
to
pass
these
laws
that
they
have.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
--
oh,
both
nelson
cases?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
not
--
not
closely.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
believe
that
they
are.
neither
can
i
believe
that
congress
intended
to
leave
the
prosecutions
for
the
crime
of
sedition
against
the
u.s.
to
the
diverse
and
unregulated
and
perhaps
historical
handlings
of
local
state
and
municipal
offices.
these
considerations
together
with
the
major,
the
very
basic
consideration
of
supersession
make
this
case,
i
suppose,
a
very
important
one.
but
important
or
not,
this
much,
i
respectfully
submit.
win
or
lose
this
case,
nelson
remains
in
prison
for
his
crime
of
sedition
against
the
u.s.
to
lose
this
case,
i
think
something
important
from
the
concept
of
federalism
for
what
has
been
lost
and
something
irreplaceable
in
our
concept
of
civil
liberties.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
the
a
four-to-one
decision
has
held
that
the
federal
law
supersedes
the
state.
i
disagree
that
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
three
justices
was
half-hearted.
they
expressly
concur
in
every
court,
in
every
respect.
before
examining
the
various
considerations
applicable
to
a
determination
of
congressional
intent
and
a
determination
of
the
supersession
issue,
it
is
important,
first
of
all,
to
know
the
issue
to
what
is
actually
before
the
court.
we
have
involved,
here,
solely,
sedition
against
the
united
states
as
such.
not
sedition
against
the
state
or
not
even
sedition
against
the
government
or
against
organized
government
general
--
generally,
which
i
suppose
would
necessarily
included
this
thing.
on
page
58
of
the
transcript,
the
majority
opinion
states
as
follows
in
request
to
what
is
--
in
respect
to
what
is
involved
here.
and,
while
the
pennsylvania
statute
proscribes
sedition
against
either
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
government
of
pennsylvania,
it
is
only
alleged
sedition
against
the
united
states
with
which
the
instant
case
is
concerned.
out
of
all
the
voluminous
testimony,
we
have
not
found
nor
has
anyone
pointed
to,
a
single
word
indicating
a
seditious
act
or
even
utterance
directed
against
the
government
of
pennsylvania.
and
so,
even
the
minority
opinion
of
judge
bell
--
justice
bell
relies
heavily
on
the
proposition
that
since
the
federal
government
has
been
somewhat
remise
in
protecting
its
--
in
protecting
the
u.s.
against
sedition,
the
state
had
every
right
to
step
in
to
fill
the
breach.
so,
we
have,
in
--
in
effect,
a
unanimous
determination
by
all
the
justices
that
this
case
and
this
prosecution
and
this
conviction
involved
the
crime
of
sedition
against
the
united
states.
that
serves
to
greatly
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you've
--
you've
heard
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
the
--
the
argument
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
evidence
and
the
--
the
fact
shows
sedition
--
seditious
utterances
against
the
united
states
and
not
the
state
that
those
utterances
at
the
same
time
constitute
utterances
against
the
state
and
that
ipso
facto
sedition
against
the
us
is
--
is
sedition
against
the
state.
the
answer
to
that
argument
is
that
first,
this
begets
the
different
--
different
political
capacities
and
sovereignties
of
the
two
governments
which
are
distinct
which
has
their
own
elected
officers
and
which
do
operate,
separately.
i
don't
think
it's
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
seditious
act
against
the
state,
for
instance,
in
the
regime
of
(inaudible)
long.
it
might
be
that
there
might
have
been
fanatics
who
were
--
would
conspire
to
overthrow
the
state
government
there
while
at
the
same
time
being
completely
loyal
to
the
federal
government.
and
perhaps
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
--
that
is
also
true.
yes.
and
to
give
us
another
possible
example
of
--
of
sedition
against
the
state
as
distinguished
from
the
united
states
in
the
present
conflict
or
disturbances
over
the
integration
problems.
there
might
be
some
fanatics
who
had
--
who
might,
while
being
loyal
to
the
federal
government,
advocate
some
type
of
sedition
against
particular
states
in
respect
to
that
problem.
i
think
--
i
think
that
to
say
that
the
--
the
states
that
the
sedition
against
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
an
ipso
facto
constitutes
sedition
against
the
states,
confuses
interest
with
jurisdiction.
certainly,
no
one
denies
that
the
states
would
have
a
great
interest
in
the
problem
of
sedition
against
the
united
states
and
that
they
would
be
affected
and
perhaps
vitally
affected
by
any
attempts
at
sedition
against
the
united
states.
that,
however,
cannot
under
our
federal
system,
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
states
to
enact
laws
on
the
subject,
anymore
for
instance
than
to
say,
“if
there
were
disturbances
in
the
mexican
border,”
and
serious
disturbances
which
did
threaten
the
lives
and
properties
of
the
citizens
of
texas,
anymore
than
such
disturbances
which
would
be
very
real,
would
warrant
the
state
of
texas
from
defending
its
ranges
across
the
border
or
from
--
or
for
--
in
adopting
some
law
to
cope
with
that
problem.
the
problem
is
one
for
the
united
states
to
cope
with
and
the
united
states
alone.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
of
course.
or
--
or
if
the
seditious
utterances
gave
rise
to
any
riots
or
anything
of
that
nature
or
if
there
are
any
actual
acts
of
violence
committed
along
way,
of
course,
the
states
could
take
care
of
it
and
there
are
adequate
laws
in
the
books
to
do
that
as
stated
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
its
decision.
so,
there's
no
real
problem
of
the
states
not
being
able
to
protect
itself
in
--
in
view
of
court's
decision
below.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
a
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
a
--
a
state
statute
based
on
a
purpose
of
preventing
riots
or
basis
of
the
peace
would
be
one
thing.
but
that
is
not
here.
it
was
not
so
construed
by
the
state
supreme
court.
in
fact,
the
court
is
very
--
that
the
--
the
supreme
court
here
went
out
of
its
way
to
find
out
that
this
was
not
a
breach
of
peace
statute.
but
this
was
solely
a
statute
directed
against
treason
or
against
the
sedition
against
the
united
states,
as
such,
so
distinguished
that
type
of
protection
from
the
protection
that
the
statute
undertook.
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
except
that
we
have
a
direct
construction
by
the
state
supreme
court
here
that
the
statute
is
--
appears
as
sedition
statute
and
therefore
that's
precisely
the
whole
problem
of
the
fellow
supremacy.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
not
that
didn't
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
the
difference
is
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
one
--
one
very
great
distinction
which
admittedly
occurs
is
this.
that
it's
--
it's
in
the
extent
of
punishment
of
breach
of
peace
statute
was,
i
assume,
have
a
much
less
punishment
than
20
years
imprisonment
or
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
there
--
there
--
it's
true.
there's
no
constitutional
limit
beyond
the
--
the
impressive
punishment
provision
of
constitution.
but
in
practical
effects,
i
think
there
would
be
a
distinction
in
punishments
and
there
would
practically
be
a
distinction
in
prosecution
methods
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
murder,
a
breach
of
the
peace,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
this
--
this
case
involves
no
such
aspect
whatsoever.
there's
no
evidence
of
violence
that's
involved
here
but
(voice
overlap)
--
to
protect
them
with
this.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
does
not.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i'm
saying
to
that
--
i'm
saying
that
it
is
not
that.that
it
is
a
pure
seditious
or
a
statute
against
sedition.
i
think
this
whole
concept
of
stepping
in
because
of
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes.
i
think
this
--
this
whole
concept
of
the
right
of
the
states
to
step
in
because
of
a
great
interest
in
the
subject
and
that
of
the
state
has
here
is
a
very
dangerous
one.
by
that
same
reasoning,
the
state
could,
i
suppose,
undertake
to
help
the
federal
government
and
enforce
most
any
of
its
laws.
it
could
pass
the
laws
making
it
a
crime
not
to
file
and
settle
income
tax
reports
on
the
theory
that
it's
important
to
the
states
that
the
federal
government
had
adequate
money
to
defend
itself
from
the
country
and
to
supply
the
state
in
times
when
the
states
needs
money
and
so
on.
there's
no
limit,
in
other
words,
to
where
that
concept
might
lead.
and
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
we
have
here
a
--
the
problem
of
federal
supremacy,
the
federal
versus
the
state
government
in
their
respective
fields
of
operation.
the
treason
cases
were
mentioned
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
come
to
that
shortly.
i'll
mention
the
treason
cases
for
just
a
moment.
the
ex
parte
warrior
and
people
versus
lynch,
early
west
virginia
and
early
new
york
cases
held
specifically
that
--
that
the
state
of
--
the
states
cannot
punish
for
treason
against
the
u.s.
against
the
united
states
and
give
various
reasons
for
that
reasoning,
all
which,
i
think,
are
directly
applicable
here.
treason
is
distinguishable
only
in
degree,
i
think,
from
sedition.
it
involves
the
existence
of
the
governments
in
both
cases
and
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
with
here.
now,
returning
to
this
issue
of
supersession,
it's
our
basic
position
here
that
the
federal
interest
in
the
subject
matter
is
--
is
so
as
such
and
it
--
it
is
so
dominant
and
the
--
the
nature
of
the
problem
is
such
that's
--
once
the
federal
government
has
undertaken
to
make
some
legislation
on
this
subject,
that
legislation
then
must
become
exclusive,
must
become
exclusive,
ipso
facto,
exclusive.
that
involves,
first,
i
suppose
is
an
examination
of
the
nature
of
the
power
which
we
just
are
concerned
with
here.
no
one
denies
that
the
power
is
of
--
the
powers
are
being
exercised
here
to
protect
the
federal
government
from
sedition,
springs
from
the
various,
very
highest
of
sources
article
1,
section
8
of
the
constitution
provides
for
the
common
defense
and
general
welfare
is
one
base
of
the
power
here.
another
is
article
4,
section
4,
guaranteeing
the
states
a
republican
form
of
government.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
dennis
case,
indeed
the
whole
court
in
the
dennis
case,
gave
specific
recognition
to
the
very
high
nature
of
the
power
being
exercised
from
the
government
--
federal
government
undertakes
to
proscribe
sedition,
springing
from
the
very
roots
of
sovereignty,
i
think
is
one
of
the
phrases
used.
the
government
has
stated
in
its
brief
and
the
states
have
not
disputed,
the
proposition
that
the
national
interest
in
its
--
in
its
subject
is
obviously
paramount.
further,
that
the
problem
is
a
national
problem
which
caused
resolution
on
the
national
scale.
that
--
that
sets
off
the
type
of
power
here
which
is
here
being
exercised
from
other
types
of
power,
for
instance,
the
power
under
the
commerce
--
commerce
clause
in
which
the
supersession
issues
are
most
usually
raised,
posing
it
as
a
much
--
that
there's
a
power
with
much
higher
nature.
in
addition,
we
have
entanglements
or
considerations
of
foreign
relations
and
foreign
policy.
this
court
in
the
dennis
case
has
again
pointed
out
those
considerations,
the
foreign
policy
considerations
in
respect
to
any
attempt
to
proscribe
sedition.
the
government
in
--
in
its
brief
here,
the
federal
government
in
its
brief
here
and
in
--
in
its
brief
in
the
dennis
case
was
very
explicit
in
finding
out
the
foreign
relation
aspects
of
any
attempt
to
deal
with
sedition
in
present
day
and
--
and
present
times.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
congress
when
it
passed
the
1950
internal
security
of
the
1954
communist
control
act,
specifically
enumerated
various
foreign
relation
aspects
of
the
problem
in
its
preamble
to
these
pieces
of
legislation.
finally,
another
consideration
funneling
up
to
the
source
of
the
power
that's
being
here
exercised,
is
the
--
the
civil
liberty
aspects
of
the
case.
we
are
dealing
here
with
sedition
which
is
advocacy
or
speech.
it
isn't
acts
of
violence
or
--
or
physical
acts
of
sabotage
or
so
on.
it
involves
speech
making,
avocations
of
various
source,
which
is
in
the
realm
of
first
amendment
protections
requiring
that
the
attorney
general
has
stated,
“a
very
delicate
balancing
of
various
considerations.”
the
first
amendment
protections
on
the
one
hand,
protections
against
the
--
protection
of
the
national
security
on
the
other.
however
in
any
event,
balances
or
balances
things
which
should
be
undertaken,
i
should
think
by
the
federal
government
and
not
by
48
states.
it
should
be
undertaken
on
--
on
uniform
single
basis
rather
on
a
diversified
multiple
basis.
thus
--
thus
we
are
--
thus
in
speaking
of
the
power
that
has
here
been
exercised,
we
are
on
an
entirely
different
plane
and
in
an
--
an
entirely
different
category
from
the
usual
supersession
case
where
we're
worried
about
the
--
the
right
of
the
states
to
label
cans
or
to
--
to
make
regulations
of
its
highways
or
to
undertake
any
of
the
other
usual
traditional
state
functions
under
its
state
police
powers.
indeed,
i
think
it's
very
questionable
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
state
is
exercising
any
traditional
state
police
power
when
it
attempts
to
proscribe
sedition
against
the
united
states
as
distinguished
from
sedition
against
the
state.
as
noted
by
the
concurring
opinion
below,
sedition
against
the
united
states
is
not
a
local
offense,
it
is
a
crime
against
the
nation.
traditionally,
police
power
is
exercised
in
respect
to
matters
of
local
interest
or
local
concerns,
never
has
it
exercised
in
respect
to
matters
which
are
the
concern
of
neighboring
states
of
all
of
the
states
or
citizens
of
all
of
the
states.
and
that
is
precisely
what
was
done
here,
when
any
state
attempts
to
legislate
in
respect
to
sedition
against
the
united
states.
so
i
think
it
can
be
a
question
that
we
had
even
a
field
in
which
the
state
is
exercising
traditionally
an
aspect
of
its
police
power,
at
least
insofar
as
sedition
against
the
united
states
is
concerned.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
they're
reflected
in
(inaudible),
we
have
(inaudible)
cite
--
cited
in
the
brief.
but
we
haven't
got
the
list
of
municipalities
in
the
brief.
but
there
are
references
to
sources
from
which
that
can
be
obtained.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that's
not
--
that's
not
that
this
case,
but
certainly
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
make
many
of
the
arguments
we
here
making.
we
might
have
a
problem
of
--
of
specific
supersession
because
the
smith
act
does
undertake
the
proscribed
sedition
against
the
united
states,
as
well
as
the
individual
states.
and
they
might
be
argued
because
of
that.
that
there
is
a
supersession.
but
you
couldn't
argue
that
the
--
the
states
are
not
exercising
their
traditional
police
power
or
that
are
interfering
with
the
federal
program
assigned.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
that's
on
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
that's
on
page
--
it's
on
the
government,
of
the
appellant
off
of
pennsylvania's
brief
page
2
and
3.
page
2
contains
the
smith
act,
3
contains
the
pennsylvania
act.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
the
smith
act,
lower
the
line
of
the
first
paragraph
revealing
the
--
who
willfully
advocates,
advises
and
so
on
with
--
in
the
sense
of
propriety
of
overthrowing
or
destroying
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
government
of
any
state
territory
and
so
on.
first
paragraph.
now,
since
--
since
the
subject
matter,
we
are
concerned
with
here,
sedition
against
the
united
states
is
one
of
predominant
federal
interest
in
which
admittedly
--
which
admittedly,
must
be
held
on
a
national
basis,
to
be
handled
effectively,
and
since
the
federal
government
has
actually
exercised
its
constitutional
powers
in
this
respect,
in
the
smith
act,
specifically,
and
which
describes
specific
penalties,
and
since
the
state
is
not
acting
in
a
traditional
field
of
police
powers,
this
case
must
be
decided
on
principles
entirely
different
from
the
usual
supersession
case.
and
the
presumptions
are
entirely
different.
the
issue
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
on
a
different
--
on
--
on
--
the
approach
here
must
be
entirely
different
from
the
usual
approach
and
the
usual
supersession.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i
--
i
was
going
to
get
to
that,
your
honor.
the
reason
--
we're
not
concerned
either
with
--
with
the
diversity
or
the
identity
or
the
or
even
conflict
or
--
or
even
the
compatibility
of
the
two
statutes,
so,
their
ability
to
live
together.
we're
concerned
with,
solely,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
a
state
of
power,
in
view
of
the
federal
exercise
of
this
type
of
power
to
legislate
in
the
identical
field
with
identical
legislation.
the
question
is
one
of
power
and
the
usual
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
--
that
is
not
this
case.
there
--
there
is
-
there
are
a
good
arguments
that
the
power,
even
though
not
exercised
is
exclusive
but
has
certainly
a
less
firm
argument
than
the
argument
that
when
congress
has
taken
the
thing
and
handed
as
exercise
of
jurisdiction
-
that
the
jurisdiction
then
becomes
exclusive.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
oh
yes
in
the
-
in
the
gilbert
case,
justice
brandeis
did
hold
or
did
in
his
dissent,
did
hold
that
the
federal
power
in
that
field
was
exclusive
even
if
not
exercised
by
--
by
virtue
of
its
nature.
here
we
argue
that
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
the
power
plus
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
exercised,
specifically,
jurisdiction
in
specific
respects
that
then,
on
that
account,
it
has
become
exclusive.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes
i
am
coming
to
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
we
draw
quite
an
inference
from
that.
we
--
the
--
there's
no
question
to
whether
--
whether
or
not
dual
or
double
jeopardy
is
involved
here
and
now,
it
--
it
isn't
because
the
prosecution
was
in
the
state
court
first,
so
it
could
not
be
double
jeopardy.
but
the
question
of
dual
punishment
certainly
is
very
much
here,
very
much
here.
and
this
--
that
is,
as
described
by
justice
frankfurter,
an
important
aspect,
at
least
to
civil
liberty,
and
it's
not
to
be
presumed
in
the
absence
of
some
affirmative
indication,
i
suppose,
that
congress
was
willing
to
impose
dual
punishment.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
there
haven't.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that,
as
matter
of
fact,
they're
not
to
have
(inaudible)
that
in
the
--
and
the
prohibition
law
is
the
only
single
example
of
where
congress
specifically
as
well
as
the
constitution,
specifically,
gave
both
the
federal
government
and
the
states
the
right
to
--
to
have
prosecutions
in
the
field.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
it's
specifically,
so
stated.
i
think
the
prohibition
act
specifically,
so
stated
that
both
prosecutions
could
be
by
both
governments,
specifically,
in
the
constitution.
they
give
the
man,
as
so
stated.
so,
there's
no
problem
from
there.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
there
was
no
--
that
would
--
they've
secured
vindictiveness
and
there's
no
such
intent
indicated,
although
there
was
allowances
for
the
possibility
of
--
of
punishments
in
the
two
areas.
that
was
the
lander
case
for
the
one.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
don't
know.
there
--
there
were.
the
--
the
lander
case
this
one
where
there
was
but
that
was
by
virtue
both
constitutional
and
direct
statutory
authorization.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
the
prohibition
essence,
but
that's
the
only
one
that
i
know
in
the
history
of
this
country
where
that
was
in
any
way
incurred.
and
that's
why
by
virtue
of
the
constitutional
amendment
on
the
subject.
the
--
the
inquiry
here
rather
than
as
to
any
intent
as
of
congress
to
supplant
state
legislation,
the
inquiry
was
not
directed
in
that
direction,
rather
the
inquiry
is
whether
congress
has
manifested
--
manifested
consent
that
the
states
can
step
into
this
field.
that
is
the
inquiry.
and
that
is
--
but
we
are
-
that
is
what
we
have
to
look
for
in
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
and
the
decisions
so
hold
as
i
will
come
--
as
i
will
point
out
in
a
minute.
that
is,
the
presumption
is
exactly
the
opposite
from
the
presumption
in
the
usual
supersession
case.
the
presumption
here
is
that
there
is
no
supersession
and
we
have
to
find
some
affirmative
vindication
of
congressional
consent
to
the
sharing
of
its
jurisdiction
before
we
can
say
the
states
can
exercise
or
can
enact
or
enforce
the
little
smith
act
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases.
that
--
well
that
was
the
--
the
holding
of
this
court
many
years
ago
in
houston
versus
moore,
the
case
we
rely
on
very
heavily
which
the
counsel
for
the
states
have
thought
to
distinguish
but
which
on
examination
of
the
case,
i
--
i
think
you
will
find
that
their
distinguishment
is
not
quite
accurate.
the
case
involved
an
old
--
an
old
statute
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
this
is
in
post
revolutionary
wartime
which
made
it
a
--
which
made
it
a
crime
for
a
person
to
fail
to
respond
to
a
call
by
the
president
to
the
federal
militia.
the
federal
government
had
passed
the
law
to
the
same
effect.
we've
much
the
same
situation
here
as
we
have
there,
then.
an
individual
had
failed
to
respond
to
the
president's
call
to
the
federal
militia
and
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
houston
verus
--
houston
versus
moore
back
in
(inaudible)
in
a
majority
decision
of
opinion
written
by
justice
washington,
the
court
held
that
the
pennsylvania
law
was
not
invalid
but
it
did
so
by
construing
the
pennsylvania
law,
that
is
very
important
because
the
case
is
--
is
a
difficult
one
to
read.
that
it
did
so,
solely
by
construing
the
pennsylvania
law
to
be
one
which
authorized
a
state
militia
to
prosecute
under
the
federal
law
and
the
majority
opinion
as
well
as
the
dissent
of
justice
story
was
very
emphatic,
very
emphatic
that
had
the
state
attempted
to
enact
the
identical
federal
law
and
prescribed
its
own
penalties
and
enforce
it
in
the
state
courts
or
in
the
state
court
marshall,
but
then
the
law
would
have
to
fall
under
the
theory
of
federal
supremacy.
on
that
--
on
that
holding,
on
that
reasoning
is
identical
to
the
situation
we
have
here.
here
we
have
two
criminal
statutes.
in
the
houston
versus
moore,
there's
a
criminal
statute.
here
we
have
a
criminal
statute.so
this
--
this
distinguishment
between
regulation
and
criminal
statute
is
no
quite
conclusive.
there,
the
criminal
statute
--
the
federal
power
is
being
exercised
in
the
paramount
federal
field.
that
was
brought
out
in
the
course
of
both
minority
--
minority
and
majority
decision
--
opinions
there.
and
there,
it
was
held,
specifically,
by
all
--
all
of
the
justices
that
had
the
act
--
the
pennsylvania
act,
attempted
to
--
to
proscribe
or
prescribe
the
identical
federal
offense,
making
it
a
state
crime
and
enforced
it
with
its
own
--
or
furnished
it
with
its
own
penalties,
and
then
--
then
the
law
would
have
to
fall.
and
it
was
further
stated
that
the
pennsylvania
law
could
be
sustained
only
if
congress
specifically
indicated
its
consent
that
the
state
should
assist
in
--
in
the
federal
--
in
--
in
enforcing
the
federal
law
with
respect
to
enlistments
in
the
federal
militia.
hines
versus
davidowitz
is
a
--
another
case
upon
which
we
rely
heavily.
there
we
have
the
foreign
relations
that
there
--
that,
of
course,
was
the
alien
and
sedition
case
in
which
the
state
sedition
laws
and
i
think
there
were
some
19
were
superseded
in
that
case
were
held
unconstitutional.
first,
by
reason
of
the
superior
or
dominant
nature
of
--
of
the
dominant
federal
interest
in
the
subject
matter
and
second,
because
of
the
element
of
civil
liberties
involved
to
the
personal
rights
and
freedoms,
which
it
was
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
congress
to
protect.
hines
is
therefore
very
relevant
here
on
those
two
propositions.
and
as
--
as
i
indicated
the
fact
that
there
were
a
number
of
states
which
had
--
also
had
alien
laws
did
not
deter
this
court
and
decide
us
from
defining
federal
supremacy.+
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
those
same
alien
and
sedition
laws
which
were
the
subject
of
the
litigation
on
the
hines
case
also
contains
the
identical
sedition
provisions
that
we
have
here.
title
1,
i
think,
contained
the
alien
--
the
alien
clause
and
title
3
contained
the
same
identical
sedition
law,
this
1940
smith
act
that
we
have
here.
there's
one
body
of
law
at
that
time
since
it's
been
recodified
into
separate
sections.
these
--
these
courts
--
and
even
in
the
cases
where
there
is
no
big
dominant
federal
interest
and
where
the
state
is
legislating
in
a
field
which
is
traditionally
its
own,
that
is
under
its
traditional
state
police
powers,
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
the
states
cannot
enact
identical
--
identical
legislation
and
prescribe
different
or
heavier
or
lighter
penalties
on
the
theory
that
once
congress
has
enacted
a
law
specifically
under
an
exercise
of
its
--
one
of
its
powers,
the
states
simply
cannot
be
permitted
to
enact
this,
the
identical
law.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
either
as
a
help
or
for
the
--
because
of
the
principle
of
federal
supremacy.
once
the
federal
government
has
acted,
that
is
it.
the
federal
government
just
felt
that
the
--
for
instance
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
--
the
punishments
would
make
(inaudible),
the
punishments
are
less,
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
the
punishments
were
equal
or
more
or
less,
still
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
i
didn't
mean
to,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
that
the
punishments
make
no
difference
whatsoever.
now,
the
dissents
of
--
of
three
of
the
justices
here
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
discusses
at
length
this
--
this
very
proposition
and
states
very
expressly
that
--
in
that
kind
of
situation,
we
have
to
find
some
indication
of
congressional
consent,
affirmative
indication
of
congressional
consent
that
the
states
can
occupy
a
federal
or
can
take
over
a
federal
jurisdiction.
so,
we
had
not
only
that
concept
here
but
we
have
the
more
important
concept
of
federal
dominance
in
the
field.
and
those
two
together,
we
submit
very,
very
respectively,
those
two
concepts
together,
make
it
very
necessary
here
that
congress
shall
--
has
indicated
some
or
rather
either
in
the
legislation
or
in
its
history
a
consent
that
--
that
the
states
can
step
in,
in
this
very
important
field
and
pass
their
own
laws
with
their
own
penalties.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
they're
greatly
--
it's
different
all
over.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
the
--
in
the
smith
act
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
the
punishments
--
in
the
pennsylvania
act,
the
punishment
is
maximum
which
was
given
to
nelson.
it
was
20
years
and
$10,000
fine.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
the
state
prosecution.
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
penalty
there.
in
the
federal
prosecution,
the
penalties
range
from
five
to
eight
years
and
he
received
five
years.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
helpful
but
it's
not
material,
no.
whether
the
punishment
is
less
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
or
the
--
the
same
or
--
or
greater,
makes
no
--
great
difference
under
the
principle
of
federal
supremacy.
that
is,
if
out
of
the
theory
that
if
--
under
--
under
this
theory,
congress
has
taken
the
matter
in
hand,
has
given
it
consideration.
it's
thought
that
so
many
years
of
punishment
and
so
much
fine
is
a
sufficient
(inaudible)
you
must
remember
we're
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
and
--
and
that
should
be
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
i
--
i
said
it's
relevant.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
wouldn't
care
if
it
was
the
same.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
i
say
--
i
say
it's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
thought
it
was
vitally
important
but
he
also
said
--
he
also
said,
whether
they're
equal
or
greater
or
less,
makes
no
difference.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
yes.
i
don't
mean
to
throw
it
away.
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
throw
it
away.
i
mere--
i
merely
meant
to
emphasize
the
--
the
importance
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
that's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
all
right.
now,
the
earlier
authorities
on
this
--
on
this
--
this
proposition
of,
once
the
federal
government
has
stepped
in
the
--
the
congress
has
to
affirmatively
indicate
its
consent
to
(inaudible)
versus
pennsylvania,
the
southern
railway
case
versus
indiana,
236,
u.s.,
rice
versus
santa
fe
and
it
is
the
(inaudible)
in
the
california
versus
(inaudible)
discuss
all
of
these
cases
at
length.
now,
on
this
matter
of
intent
of
has
been
over,
i
either
contended
and
the
--
the
simple
reason
that
it
can't
be
that
congress
has
in
any
way
manifested
affirmatively
that
the
states
should
step
in
and
pass
similar
laws.
there's
no
indication
on
that
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
to
its
intent
in
any
respect
is
--
is
pretty
nebulous.
there
is
--
much
of
it
in
--
in
a
case
not
the
history.
that's
what
congress
did
intend
but
we
--
we
are
--
we're
--
we're
concerned
with
the
proposition
here
that
congress
must,
under
the
decision
of
this
court,
must
affirmatively
indicate
somehow
either
on
its
history
or
it's
in
--
in
the
legislation
itself
contend
to
the
sharing
of
jurisdiction,
that
we
haven't
got.
section
3231
of
the
criminal
code
as
relied
on,
that's
the
saving
clause
which
follows
a
--
a
general
--
i'll
read
it.
a
general
provision
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
criminal
matters
is
exclusive.
section
3231
in
its
entirety
reads,
"the
district
courts
of
the
u.s.
shall
have
the
original
jurisdiction
exclusive
of
the
courts
of
the
states,
of
all
offenses
against
the
laws
of
the
united
states."
and
then
in
an
order
to
save
the
traditional
jurisdiction
of
the
states
in
matters
traditionally
theirs,
this
paragraph
was
added
immediately.
"nothing
in
this
title
shall
be
held
to
take
away
or
impair
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
several
states
under
the
laws
thereof."
it
is
under
the
laws
of
the
state
courts
and
i
will
assume
under
the
valid
laws
of
the
state
courts
or
otherwise
we
are
begging
the
entire
question
here.
3231
is
not
a
section
which
accompanies
the
smith
act.
it's
a
general,
overall
general
saving
clause
which
has
been
on
the
federal
criminal
code
for
many
--
many
years.
it
has,
to
my
knowledge,
never
been
held
to
authorize
states
however,
to
pass
or
--
or
enforce
federal
law
--
federal
criminal
laws
in
a
strictly
federal
field
such
as
--
well,
take,
for
instance,
the
federal
crime
of
contempt
in
a
federal
court
or
contempt
of
the
federal
committee,
under
their
arguments
that
--
of
the
state
as
to
the
effect
of
3231.
i
suppose
the
states
could
check
into
those
fields
as
well.
i
--
i
think
3231
has
to
be
taken
to
mean
that
the
--
the
general
clause
which
gives
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
and
criminal
matters
under
the
federal
criminal
code
shall
not
apply
to
the
states'
jurisdiction
in
matters
where
the
states
have
a
traditional
jurisdiction
which
would
--
which
is
not
the
present
case.
and
certainly,
it's
such
a
general
saving
clause
is
not
the
affirmative
consent
which
the
cases
indicate
are
required
in
this
type
of
a
situation.
well
there
are
other
factors
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
houston
versus
moore
states
that
for
one,
california
versus
zook
dissent.
there
are
any
number
of
cases
set
forth
in
that
--
the
two
dissents
of
justice
frankfurter,
justice
burton,
douglas.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
would
not
have
power
because
the
congress
has
expressly
and
explicitly
in
a
very
narrow
field
made
known
its
desires
in
the
matter.and
it
has
legislation
and
prescribed
punishment
specifically.
in
that
type
of
situation,
where
there's
no
question
of
the
(inaudible)
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
those
mostly
arose
out
of
interstate
transactions
or
interstate
commerce
transactions.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
was
--
that
is
the
holding
of
those
cases.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
varnville,
yes.
the
rice
versus
santa
fe
railroad
was
one.
southern
railway
versus
railway
commission
of
indiana
from
236
u.s.
was
another,
the
zook
dissent
has
all
those
cases
connected
in
it.
and
it
has
affirmatively
stated
that
congress
must
give
its
consent
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
if
--
if
--
assuming
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
assuming
that's
sedition
is
against
the
u.s.
is
--
is
sedition
against
the
state.
that's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
i
don't
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
question.
the
state
supreme
court
has
very
specifically
stated
that
the
--
the
--
i'll
read
it
again.
"that
it
--
it
is
only
alleged
sedition
against
the
united
states"
with
which
we
are
here
concerned,
not
against
the
state.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
not
against
the
state.
so
--
so
we
have
a
situation
where
congress
has
passed
a
specific
law
on
prescribing
sedition
against
the
u.s.
and
the
state
has
also
passed
a
specific
law
on
that
very
same
subject.
production
of
these
cases
that
i've
just
discussed
in
the
zook
dissent
are,
to
the
effect,
that
in
that
type
of
situation
where
there's
a
direct
similarity
and
that
congress
has
spoken
that
that
is
conclusive
and
that
congress
must
let
the
states
know
affirmatively
that
they
can
step
in
before
they
even
attempt
to
step
in.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
zook
case
is
entirely
distinguishable
from
this
case
on
its
--
on
facts.
there
we
had
no
exercise
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
was
no
sedition
or
no
paramount
federal
interest.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
majority
found
that
the
state
--
the
state
interest
there
was
paramount.
the
case
involved
regulation
of
these
people
that
--
except
transportation
for
--
taken
on
purposes
for
hire
and
the
said
state
had
--
even
had
a
paramount
interest
in
that
type
of
situation.
and
therefore,
even
though
there
might
be
some
identity
between
the
two
statutes
which
there
was,
therefore,
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
federal
government
could
have
said
that
but
the
federal
government
didn't
--
hadn't
expressly
said
that
our
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
here.
the
dissent
was
very
strong.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
then,
of
course,
there'd
be
no
question.
then,
of
course,
there'd
be
no
question
at
all.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
was
the
holding
if
i'm
--
in
the
case.
the
dissent
said
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is,
your
honor,
yes.
of
course,
we
--
here,
we
have
no
dominant,
not
even
an
attempt
to
say
that
state
interest
is
predominant.
state
interest
is
important,
vital
but
not
predominant.
there
are
other
supersession
arguments
available.
i
won't
take
the
time
to
go
into
them.
one
is
the
occupancy
or
the
field
argument.
we've
got
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
which
goes
into
the
whole
for
our
subject
matter
of
sedition,
in
broad
regulatory
sense.
we've
got
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
which
further
implements
that.
so
it's
--
it
seemed
pretty
good
that
congress
has
--
has
legislated
very
generally
and
very
specifically
in
the
field
on
the
cloverleaf
butter,
for
the
rest,
that
would
be
an
indication
as
congress
meant
to
occupy
this
thing.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
isn't
that
the
same
3231
we're
talking
about?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
it
is.
that
is
a
general
--
that
was
a
--
that
--
that
wasn't
part
of
the
smith
act
itself
as
i
understood
it.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
part
of
the
whole
federal
criminal
code.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right.
well
as
i
said
before,
that
is
a
general
saving
clause
and
i
--
and
unless
we're
going
to
beg
the
question,
i
think
it
must
mean
that
it's
saving
state
law
to
the
extent
that
they
are
otherwise
valid,
that
is
in
a
traditional
state
field
and
so
on
and
had
nothing
to
precede
it.
otherwise,
as
i've
said,
that
section
would
authorize
the
state
to
step
into
any
typical
field
of
pure
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
such
as
a
treason
or
against
the
united
states
or
such
as
a
contempt
of
in
the
federal
court
or
contempt
of
federal
committee.
pardon?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
3231,
but
it
was
there
a
long
time
before
that,
same
language.
that
was
-
that's
an
old
--
i
don't
know
how
long,
but
it'd
been
there
since
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
was
and
before
that
even.
i
--
in
fact,
i
think
there's
some
mention
about
the
houston
versus
moore.
it
was
back
that
far.
it's
been
recodified
back
and
forth
since.
the
last
--
last
recodification
was
in
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
--
i
think
it
if
it
follows
immediately
a
cause
which
states
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
and
federal
criminal
matters
shall
be
exclusive.it
follows
that
immediately.
and
i
think
it's
meant
to
--
to
save
the
traditional
state
jurisdiction
and
in
--
a
jurisdictional
state
field
such
as
the
marshall
or
the
counterfeiting
case
or
the
marshall
case
where
the
--
where
the
state
has
jurisdiction
and
where
the
criminal
law
is
on
a
different
plane
from
i
--
i
think
it
must
mean
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
wouldn't.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
would
have
--
would
have
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
and
that
would
be
in
the
counterfeiting
cases
or
in
the
molesting
of
marshall
or
the
federal
marshall
or
that
type
of
case
where
there
is
traditionally,
you've
given
examples
from
the
zook
case
where
there
are
the
two
planes
of
jurisdiction.
and
where
there
is
jurisdiction,
but
it
begs
the
question
here
to
say
that
that
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
--
the
state.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
a
reserve.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
--it
uses
the
--
the
very
general
language.
it
certainly
isn't
the
affirmative
consent
in
any
event.
it
isn't
the
affirmative
consent
to
the
sharing
of
jurisdiction
in
the
act
that
we're
talking
about,
the
smith
act
which
i
say
the
cases
hold
the
requirement.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
--
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
in
--
in
those
cases,
the
--
first
of
all,
there
is
a
traditional
state
police
power
jurisdiction
without
any
question.
now,
kidnapping
or
robbery,
and
all
--
all
traditional
and
not
federal
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
bank
robbery,
that's
national
or
not,
that's
a
traditional
state
criminal
offense,
common
law
offense
under
--
under
any
system
of
government,
i
suppose.
that
--
that's
--
is
on
a
different
plane
from
what
we
have
here.
here
we
don't
have,
in
the
case
of
sedition
against
the
united
states,
a
traditional
exercise
of
police
power.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
the
--
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
sir?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
most
of
them
after
the
first
world
war
and
there's
been
rise
of
them
in
recent
years.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
none.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right.
and
also
he
was
very
concerned
about
the
problem
of
dual
punishment.
but
what's
to
happen
then
or
the
problem
of
double
jeopardy
or
the
problem
is
a
--
for
instance,
is
a,
supposing
the
--
of
a
person
is
ineptly
tried,
a
person
that's
a
seditious
person
is
ineptly
tried
in
the
state
court,
like
in
the
bar
of
prosecution
and
federal
one,
there
is
double
jeopardy.
that
might
do
great
harm
to
the
national
security
program.
that's
one
of
the
consideration
here.
then
we
do
have
--
we
do
have
actual
direct
conflicts
here
in
the
penalties
and
procedures
available.
i
suppose
the
briefing
in
the
hayes
versus
florida
and
similar
cases
where
there
is
conflict,
that
the
federal
must
be
deemed
to
supersede
the
state
would
be
applicable
on
--
on
that
ground.
we
have,
as
i
just
mentioned,
that
possibility
that
the
state
acts
will
stand
as
a
bar
to
or
at
least,
will
hinder
effective
enforcement
of
the
federal
law.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
against
this
type
of
activities
with
the
lost
of
the
pennsylvania
decision
below
were
upheld.
i
--
i
can't
agree
with
that.
in
the
first
place,
our
--
our
record
of
--
of
convictions
and
prosecutions
in
the
federal
courts
of
--
on
--
under
the
smith
act
against
the
communist
leaders
on
all
levels
of
importance
is
a
pretty
complete
one.
the
annual
report
of
the
attorney
general
than
of
the
fbi
indicate
that
we
can
expect
the
most
adequate
enforcement
at
the
federal
level.
there's
no
any
case
and
whatsoever
of
any
practical
need
for
the
states
to
step
in.
as
far
as
their
own
citizens
are
concerned,
the
states
have
ample
laws
in
the
books
as
noted
by
the
majority
opinion
below
to
take
against
any
breaches
of
peace
or
violence
or
sabotage
or
any
other
type
of
activity
other
than
the
nonstate
activity
of
subversion
against
the
united
states,
subversion
against
the
states
as
such
or
again
to
organized
governments
still
could
be
prosecuted
and
protected
against.
and,
of
course,
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
states
from
cooperating
in
every
respect
and
i
hope
that
they
do
with
the
federal
government,
then
enforcing
it.
they
have
done
it
in
this
--
they
have
done
very
successfully
in
the
past.
i
--
i
just
don't
see
as
a
practical
matter,
the
great
need
for
state
law
in
respect
to
the
subject
of
sedition
against
the
united
states
as
distinguishing
sedition
against
the
states.
we
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
would
be
more
difficult,
yes,
your
honor.
the
majority
found
that
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
it's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
as
applied
in
this
case
and
it's
construed
by
the
supreme
court
in
its
decision
applying
it
to
this
case.
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
unrealistic
to
imagine
a
world
of
conspiracy
against
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
we
--
we
all
know
what
we're
dealing
with,
the
world
conspiracy
against
the
united
states
and
this
--
for
united
states
to
handle
it,
this
--
it's
too
much
important
and
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
too
much
for
national
concern.
pardon?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
yes,
i
recall
that.
then,
we
--
we
--
we'd
mentioned
the
--
briefly
the
two
punishment
acts
aspects
of
this
case.
i
think
they're
--
they're
very
important.
two
of
punishment
is
i
think
an
important
aspect
of
civil
liberties
as
they're
mentioned
by
at
least
several
members
of
this
court.
our
society
is
dedicated
to
preventing
undue
oppression
against
individuals.
that's
a
whole
scheme
of
our
american
civilization
and
to
assume
without
any
direct
indication
in
the
congressional
record
or
in
the
act
that
congress
intended
to
impose
something
which
would
be
a
keen
to
oppression.
i
think
is,
to
say
the
least,
uncharitable
to
congress.
we
can't
simply
assume
in
other
words
that
congress
intended
to
impose
this
possibility
of
dual
punishment
not
only
dual
but
multiple
punishments.
we
have
municipalities
in
many
states,
then
--
then
in
many
--
many
municipalities
and
some
single
states,
which
shall
pass
their
little
smith
acts
and
what
--
what
could
be
expected
to
resolve
the
matter
isn't
difficult
to
imagine.
i
remember
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
about
municipalities?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
it
is.
it's
in
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
amici
--
individual
of
amici
filed
by
frank
donner.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
frank
donner
and
it's
the
amici
--
it's
called
brief
of
individual
amici
curiae,
white
covered
brief,
what
page?
our
--
and
in
the
civil
liberties,
american
civil
liberties
in
your
brief
too,
i
think.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
all
right.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
on
this
question
of
dual
punishments,
i
--
i
remember
discussing
this
case
with
my
friends,
they
say,
“well,
what's
the
difference?
that
--
that
the
fellow
get
20
years
in
pennsylvania
and
the
other
five
years
and
after
that
in
the
federal
jail
and
then
after
that,
if
he
can
get
extradited
to
a
state
which
has
capital
punishment
fund.
well,
that
--
that
concept
is,
what
to
me,
is
the
most
serious
danger
in
this
whole
business
here.
that
brings
to
mind,
george
cannon's
warnings
in
--
quoted
by
justice
frankfurter
in
the
dennis
case,
that's
in
--
in
attempting
to
protect
--
to
protect
against
communism
or
in
great
danger
of
becoming
like
them.
and
--
so
for
those
reasons,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
we
can
be
allowed
to
presume
the
commerce
intended
to
--
to
permit
not
only
dual
but
perhaps
multiple
and
endless
punishment
for
the
identical
crime.
it's
identical
crime
that's
involved
in
such
case.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
your
honor.
it's
always
in
a
reference
to
the
united
states
or
the
nation
or
some
such
similar
but
not
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
any
individual
states.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
absolutely
none.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
absolutely
none.
but
so
found
by
the
state
supreme
court
of
--
part
of
the
--
the
statement
i
read
earlier.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
would,
your
honor.
it
would,
your
honor,
but
that's
--
that's
their
finding
which
has
--
i
suppose
the
finding
here.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
there
had
been
numerous
criteria.
the
rice
--
rice
verus
santa
fe
railway
case
and
perhaps
it
contains
a
good
summary
of
all
the
various
criteria
there
is
in
any
single
case.
zook
contains
much
of
the
applicable
law
on
the
subject.
but
one
of
the
most
important
consideration
is
always
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
legislation.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
--
that's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
--
no
--
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
the
incompatibility
or
the
possibility
or
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
exists
are
the
same.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
whether
the
two
could
exist
side
by
side.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
--
that's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
true
in
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
true
in
most
of
the
regulation
cases,
where
as
i've
said
before
the
state,
is
exercising
some
traditional
and
important
state
police
power.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
as
long
as
they
don't
--
as
long
there's
a
direct
interference
or
an
inability
of
this
federal
law
to
operate
along
the
side
of
the
state.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that'd
be
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
cloverleaf.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
that's
true.
that's
true.
it
wasn't
even
true
there.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
--
that's
true.
that's
the
other
--
but
then,
there's
--
[laughter],
yeah.
but
--
but
then,
there's
the
other
line
that
even
in
--
in
the
field
of
traditional
state
interest
in
regulation
and
even
in
the
commerce
cases,
where
there
is
identicalness
of
the
two
statutes.
federal
supremacy
requires
that
congress
have
indicated
a
consent
that
the
states
also
--
also
act
on
the
same
subject.
well,
i'm
afraid
my
--
my
time
has
expired.
