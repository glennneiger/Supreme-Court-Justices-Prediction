mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
has
just
made
the
argument
that
there
are
other
statutes
which
enable
pennsylvania
to
preserve
order
such
as
a
riot
statute
or
arson
statute,
but
the
difficulty
with
these
movements
is
they
don't
start
with
riot
and
arson.
the
state
can
wait.
the
blood
is
running
in
the
streets
and
remission
plans
are
reduced
to
ruin.
a
communist
meeting
can
be
held
in
imperfect
order,
no
riot.
what
the
state
has
to
have
the
power
to
do
is
to
prohibit
advocating
overthrowing
the
government.
it
prohibits
selling
literature,
advocating
over
or
through
the
government.
both
the
federal
act
and
the
state
act
prohibit
both
those
acts
and
that
is
why
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
a
statute
such
as
the
pennsylvania
act,
sedition
act
and
the
smith
act
of
congress.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
i
--
i
don't
have
that
figure,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
but
this
was
the
--
i
think
there
had
been
several
in
allegheny
county.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
others.
counsel
has
also
exert
and
in
this
market
made
in
the
opinion
in
a
court
that
the
evidence
shows
not
a
single
act
against
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
justice
jones
says,
“indeed,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
an
active
sedition
against
the
state
in
our
federated
system.”
that
is
not
at
once
an
act
of
sedition
against
the
government
of
the
united
states.
how
could
they
rebel
against
the
united
states
or
institute
a
movement
against
united
states
without
--
without
also
involving
the
locality
in
the
state
without
us
to
begin.
but
the
--
the
court
of
pennsylvania
did
not
pass
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
caused
the
indictment.
so
in
determining
this
question,
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
indictment.
nothing
else
is
before
the
court.
that
was
passed
on
by
the
court.
that
indictment
specifically
alleged
the
advocating
and
selling
literature
for
the
purpose
of
over
--
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
so
there
is
an
act
squarely
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
that's
all
that
--
it
was
on
the
indictment
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
was
entirely
and
exclusively
based.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
i
think
yes
and
--
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
--
and
advocating.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
i
didn't
get
that.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
and
also
advocating
--
advocating,
that
is
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
by
voice
also.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
that's
--
that's
what
is
alleged
in
the
indictment.
of
course,
if
the
--
if
we
go
into
the
record,
we
will
find
evidence
that
this
--
this
defendant
was
sent
to
pittsburgh
to
organize
a
movement
to
infiltrate
the
large
ammunition
industries,
the
steel
corporation,
the
westinghouse
electric
&
manufacturing,
crucible
steel
and
other
--
other
companies
which
during
the
world
war
ii
produced
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
war
ammunitions.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
we
--
we
--
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
we
support
it
as
a
law
to
prevent
advocating
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
i
do
not
--
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
and
--
and
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
and
they
advocacy,
yes,
sir.
now,
one
--
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
in
favor
of
what
--
what
the
states
believe
about
this
case
has
been
argued
that
the
states
perhaps
had
not
done
much
or
much
interested
in
the
subject
of
laws,
sedition
laws,
is
that
the
--
the
strongest
evidence
there
of
the
opinion
is
the
great
number
of
law
statutes
which
had
been
passed
both
in
the
past
and
recently
which
shows
the
prevailing
opinion
that
the
states
do
need
protection
and
that
they
do
need
protection
against
conspiracy
against
the
united
states.
the
question
has
been
argued
what
right
has
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania
to
make
it
a
crime
to
conspire
or
to
advocate
overthrowing
a
federal
government.
pennsylvania
has
all
that
powers
on
--
of
the
--
that
the
house
of
parliament
has,
except
those
which
are
delegated
with
the
united
states.
it
has
the
right
--
it
has
the
right
to
punish
any
act
which
occurs
within
its
limits
for
a
valid
reason.
now,
all
--
the
acts
which
were
--
which
were
prohibiting
which
might
intend
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
are
all
of
them
acts
done
right
within
their
territory
and
then
pennsylvania
aim
to
--
to
destroy,
what?
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
case
of
an
invasion,
the
very
existence
of
pennsylvania
would
depend
on
the
existence
and
functioning
of
the
federal
government.
there's
had
not
an
interest
to
justify
pennsylvania
and
stopping
a
conspiracy
with
an
in-zone
limits
to
overthrow
the
government
of
united
states.
congress
frequently
has
passed
laws
making
it
a
crime
for
anyone
within
the
united
states
to
organize
an
expedition
to
send
a
foreign
country
to
join
a
revolutionary
movement.
it
has
prohibited
sending
ammunitions
to
one
or
two
belligerent
in
states
in
--
in
the
effort
to
preserve
peace.
no
one
has
ever
opposed.
i
can
find
no
case
such
as
ever
questioned
a
constitution
of
power
of
congress
to
do
that,
yet,
all
of
those
acts
are
done
in
this
country.
now,
surely
the
bond
between
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
is
intimately
stronger
than
any
relation
we
may
have
with
some
foreign
country.
we
have,
i
believe
on
the
same
reasoning,
the
right
to
prohibit
those
acts
in
pennsylvania,
which
might
weaken
the
government
of
the
united
states
upon
which
we
must
depend
for
aid
in
a
case
of
war
or
invasion.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes,
it
does.
it
has
some
(inaudible)
which
are
not
duplicated
in
the
federal
acts.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
i
think
that
there
--
there
might
be
cases
but
it
wouldn't
cover
the
real
purpose
of
the
act,
which
is
to
prevent
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
involved.
what
was
left
might
be
enforced
but
it
wouldn't
accomplish
the
--
the
principle
purpose
of
the
statute.
throughout
the
brief
of
the
respondent
is
the
argument
that
congress
jurisdiction
here
is
exclusive
and
that
the
state
cannot
pass
a
sedition
act
without
getting
permission
from
congress.
counsel
bases
that
argument
on
the
very
old
case
of
houston
versus
moore.
and
then
without
going
into
the
details
statement
of
that
case,
i'd
like
to
read
you
just
what
the
majority
opinion
said
in
its
concluding
paragraph
which
was
adopted
by
a
vote
and
that
decision
was
made
by
a
vote
of
five
to
two.
and
mr.
justice
washington
said,
“upon
the
whole
or
under
the
opinion
after
most
laborious
examination
of
this
delicate
question
that
the
state
court-martial
has
a
concurrent
jurisdiction,
not
exclusive,
with
the
tribunal
pointed
out
by
the
acts
of
congress
to
try
a
malaysian
man
who
has
disobeyed
the
call
of
the
president
and
to
enforce
the
laws
of
congress
against
such
delinquent
and
that
authority
will
remain
to
be
exercised
and
until
it
shall
please
congress
to
vest
--
vest
it
exclusively
elsewhere.
the
--
that
case
went
far
beyond
what
we
asked
the
court
to
decide
here.
and
that
--
pennsylvania
there
adopted
a
statute
providing
for
a
court-martial
of
a
person
who
refused
to
obey
the
call
of
the
president
to
answer
the
call
from
malaysia.
in
other
words,
where
the
--
the
supreme
court
allowed
this
court
--
allowed
the
state
of
pennsylvania
through
a
state
court-martial
to
punish
a
man
for
violating
an
act
to
the
president
of
united
states.
we
surely
are
not
going
as
far
as
this
case.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
but
there,
the
--
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
no.
if
your
honor
--
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
--please,
the
act
of
congress
did
not
provide
for
any
proceeding
by
the
state.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
and
justice
story
construe
the
act
as
giving
--
as
giving
entire
jurisdiction
over
court-martial
in
the
act
of
congress
giving
entire
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
court-martial
to
the
federal
authority.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
that
was
really
the
difference
between
them,
the
interpretation
of
the
act.
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
that
i
could
find
but
i
wish
congress
consented
--
consented
through
the
state
doing
what
it
did.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
well,
they
were
in
a
tough
spot.
this
was
--
this
was
disasters
war
of
1912
and
that
it
--
the
majority
of
the
court
held
that
on
--
and
then
was
not
--
the
malaysian
man
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
or
part
of
the
federal
government
until
he
arrived
at
the
place
of
assembly.
and
if
a
man
never
left
his
home,
he
wasn't
under
the
act,
sorry.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes,
he
--
he
did
not
dissent
but
--
but
he
did
take
--
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
he
said
that
in
so
many
words.
you
really
started
the
doctrine
of
two
--
an
act
beginning
--
being
a
crime
against
two
states.
mr.
harry
f.
stambaugh
or
he
said,
well,
it
may
not
the
same
offense,
and
this
has
some
application
here,
well,
it
may
not
--
it
may
not
the
same
offense
that
made
punishable
both
under
the
laws
of
the
states
and
of
the
united
states.
of
course,
he
used
the
word
offense.
today,
we
use
the
word
act.
there
may
be
an
act
which
is
an
offense
against
to
both
the
federal
and
the
state
governments.
we
--
the
states
do
not
admit
that
congress
has
the
power
to
--
and
know
its
sedition
act.
in
the
gilbert
case,
the
case
of
gilbert
--
no
it's
--
the
case
of
gitlow
versus
new
york.
this
case,
the
court
said,
“in
short,
there's
freedom
of
speech.
it
does
not
deprive
a
state
as
a
primarily
and
essential
right
of
self-preservation
which
so
long
as
human
and
governments
endure,
they
cannot
be
denied.”
i
do
not
wish
to
present
any
further.
a
question
here
isn't
whether
that
congress
can
destroy
or
--
or
appeal
our
act
and
merely
stating
the
position
on
which
the
states
rely.
