well,
oh,
is
that
so?
yes.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
didn't
have
your
name
here
at
the
moment.

chief
justice

warren
mr.
barber,
what
--
what
administrative
effect
was
given
to
the
--
this
act
after
1940?
how
did
the
--
how
did
the
department
of
justice
function
with
the
local
authorities?
i
ask
that
because
i
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
attorney
general
at
that
time
myself
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
my
recollection
is
that
both
the
president
and
--
and
mr.
hoover
urged
all
law
enforcement
officers,
upon
the
receipt
of
any
subversion
evidence,
to
turn
it
over
immediately
to
the
fbi
without
evaluation
and
without
investigations
of
any
kind
on
the
theory
that
they
might
be
stumbling
into
something
of
nationwide
importance
and
they
might
even
be
arresting
undercover
fbi
men
who
had
been
placed
in
the
movement
for
strategic
purposes.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
during
the
time
that
i
was
in
that
field,
at
least
in
my
state,
there
was
a
very,
very
rigid
rule
among
the
law
enforcement
officers
not
to
touch
these
things,
but
to
deliver
them
over
immediately
to
the
fbi.

chief
justice

warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think,
mr.
stambaugh,
your
time
has
expired.
