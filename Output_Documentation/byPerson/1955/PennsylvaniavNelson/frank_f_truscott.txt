mr.
frank
f.
truscott
if
the
court
pleases,
this
case
comes
before
your
honors
on
a
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court,
court
of
last
appellate
resort
of
pennsylvania.
now,
we
think
that
sole
question
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
smith
act,
the
federal
smith
act
of
1940
is
codified
in
the
federal
criminal
code
of
1948,
supercedes,
nullifies
state
sedition
act
of
pennsylvania
of
1919
is
codified
in
the
criminal
code
of
pennsylvania
of
1939.
on
october
17th,
1950,
the
grand
jury
of
the
court
of
quarter
sessions
of
allegheny
county,
pennsylvania
found
a
true
bill
and
indicted,
one,
steve
nelson,
alias
louis
evans,
alias
hugo,
alias
steve
mesarosh.
the
motion
was
filed
towards
the
indictment.
a
hearing
was
heard
on
it.
the
motion
was
dismissed.
the
case
came
on
for
trial
in
december
4th,
1951.
the
trial
continued
until
january
the
30th,
1952
on
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
all
12
counts
of
the
indictment
was
rendered.
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
was
filed,
was
heard
by
the
court
in
bank.
the
trial
judge
and
the
judge
of
court
of
allegheny
county
and
the
judge
was
imported
from
westmoreland
county
to
sit
and
to
hear
the
motion.
the
motions
were
dismissed.
sentence
was
pronounced
on
the
defendant,
20
years
of
imprisonment,
cost
$10,000
bond.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania,
which
is
our
court
of
intermediate
appeals,
hearing
appeals
and
all
crimes
with
murder
with
some
civil
jurisdiction.
that
court
in
the
unanimous
per
curiam
opinion
affirmed
the
conviction
in
the
lower
court.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
under
a
statute,
which
gives
them
the
right,
really
not
a
right
as
a
matter
of
grace
and
where
an
unusual
extraordinary
question
or
constitutional
questions
is
involved,
an
allocatur
maybe
granted
to
our
superior
court
and
that
was
done
in
this
case.
before
the
hearing,
the
court
decided
to
find
opinion
written
by
justice
jones.
the
lower
court,
the
superior
court
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
indictment
should
be
quashed.
a
short
concurring
opinion
was
written
by
three
justices,
chief
justice
stern,
justice
allen
stearne
and
justice
chidsey.
the
very
vigorous
dissenting
opinion
was
written
by
justice
bell.
justice
musmanno
did
not
sit
because
he
was
interested
in
the
prosecution
of
the
trial
below.
justice
arnold
did
not
sit
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
superior
court
and
the
matter
was
passed
upon
in
that
court.
now,
my
reason
for
stating
that
i
think
the
sole
question
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
pennsylvania
sedition
act
is
superseded
by
the
smith
act
is
because
the
majority
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
states
after
reviewing
what
justice
jones'
concedes
might
be
errors
of
the
trial.
he
says
but
with
all
--
with
any
and
all
of
that,
we
need
not
now
be
concerned.
the
appellant's
principal
and
cogent
contention
is
that
the
supreme
--
that
the
pennsylvania
sedition
act
is
suspended
by
operation
of
law
upon
the
enactment
by
congress
by
title
1
of
the
act
of
june
the
28th,
1940
known
as
the
smith
act
which
defines
sedition
against
the
united
states
and
prescribed
punishments
therefore.
if
the
pennsylvania
act
was
so
suspended,
then
the
defendant's
conviction
cannot
be
sustained
accordingly.
we
have
met
at
the
outside
--
outset
with
this
question
which
was
presented
timely
in
the
trial
court
reserves
upon
the
superior
court
and
has
been
stressed
upon
us.
and
our
opinion,
the
contention
is
well-founded.
consequently,
the
indictment
should
imply.
mr.
frank
f.
truscott
i
think
it
depends
on,
your
honor,
how
you
reversed
it
and
what's
you
say
in
the
reversal,
of
course,
but
that
it
probably
goes
back
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
decision
upon
the
merits
of
the
case
as
of
that
time.
now,
the
other
three
justices
who
filed
this
short
concurring
opinion,
they
said
on
the
--
they
said
in
the
court's
--
short
concurring
opinion,
“we
think
this
is
a
national
question.”
and
they
ended
their
opinion
by
saying,
“we
assume
that
the
question
involved
being
obviously
one
of
national
importance
will
be
finally
determined
--
be
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.”
so
that
indicates
that
they
also
thought
that
there
was
a
sole
question
and
even
the
dissenting
opinion
thought
it
was
the
sole
question
because
justice
bells
starts
out
his
opinion
with
--
congress
has
never
once
said
the
pennsylvania
laws
of
any
state
or
any
state
law
on
sedition
is
suspended
or
invalidated.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
never
said
so.
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
on
the
question
and
in
my
opinion,
there
is
none,
it
should
certainly
not
be
resolved
in
favor
of
freeing
one
of
the
top
leaders
in
the
communist
party
in
america
who
has
been
convicted
of
plotting
the
destruction
of
our
country.
so
as
i
say
practically,
all
parties
agreed
even
the
respondent
in
his
brief
feels
that
that
is
the
question.
i
think
it
is
also
important
that
we
should
have
before
us
just
what
is
said
in
the
indictment.
i'm
quoting
from
page
6
of
my
brief
on
the
statement
of
facts,
“indictment
charged
and
really
is
that
the
defendant,
steve
nelson,
encouraged
person
as
to
engage
in
conduct
with
a
view
to
overthrowing
and
destroying
by
force
the
government
of
pennsylvania
and
of
the
united
states.
that
he
published
and
distributed
printed
matter
in
encouraging
persons
to
engage
in
conduct
with
a
view
to
overthrowing
and
destroying
by
force,
the
government
of
pennsylvania
and
of
the
united
states.”
indictment
further
charge
specifically
with
respect
to
some
of
the
matters
that
had
been
printed
by
and
distributed
by,
setting
forth
in
haec
verba
what
was
contained
in
the
material.
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
cannot
arise
by
peaceful
development,
but
can
arise
only
as
a
result
of
smashing
the
bourgeois
state
machine
and
bourgeois
army.
this
soviet
organization
alone
is
capable
of
smashing
and
finally
destroying
the
bourgeois
and
bureaucratic
and
the
judicial
process
and
this
can
be
done
only
by
revolution.
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
cannot
arise
as
the
result
of
the
peaceful
development
of
the
bourgeois
society
and
bourgeois
democracy.
it
can
arise
only
as
the
result
of
the
smashing
of
the
bourgeois
state
machine,
the
bourgeois
army,
the
bourgeois
bureaucratic
machine
and
the
bourgeois
police.
the
society
organization
and
the
state
alone
is
capable
of
immediately
and
effectively
smashing
and
finally
destroying
the
old,
the
bourgeois
bureaucratic
and
the
judicial
apparatus.
the
bourgeois
state
can
only
be
put
an
end
to
by
a
revolution.
the
replacement
of
the
bourgeois
by
proletarian
state
is
impossible
without
a
violent
revolution.
the
communists
everywhere
support
every
revolutionary
movement
against
existing
social
and
political
order
of
things.
the
communist
openly
declared
that
their
ends
can
be
attained
only
by
the
forcible
overthrow
of
all
existing
social
conditions
that
the
ruling
classes
tremble
at
a
communist
revolution.
hence,
the
transition
from
capitalism
to
socialism
and
deliberation
of
the
working
class
in
(inaudible)
capitalism
cannot
be
affected
by
slow
changes,
by
reforms,
but
only
by
a
qualitative
change
in
the
capital
system
by
a
revolution.
the
proletariat
revolution
is
--
is
impossible
without
the
forcible
destruction
of
the
bourgeois
state
machine
and
substitution
for
it
of
a
new
one.
now,
there
were
many
others.
these
are
just
examples
of
what
were
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
with
respect
to
the
specific
printed
material
that
was
distributed
or
discharged,
distributed,
that
the
respondent
distributed.
as
i
say
this
title
of
the
case
tool
about
two
months,
2700
pages
of
testimony
were
taken
which
has
been
reduced
in
our
printed
record
to
about
1400.
it
detailed
many
of
the
activities
of
the
respondent,
the
idea
of
showing
the
intent
to
which
these
things
were
distributed.but
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
we
are
concerned
here
with
that
because
i
think
all
parties
have
agreed
that
the
only
question
is
whether
there
is
one
of
supersession,
which
was
submitted
to
be
answered
by
this
court.
now,
i
think
probably
because
there
has
been
a
great
deal
said
both
in
the
opinion
of
the
learned
justice
below
and
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
about
whether
or
not
a
state
can
pass
the
sedition
act
proscribing
the
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
only
as
distinguished
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
although
your
honors
will
note
that
in
the
excerpts
that
i
read
from
the
indictment
that
pennsylvania
as
well
as
the
united
states
were
part
of
the
objects
of
the
advocacy
of
overthrow
by
force
and
violence
in
this
case.
and
since
the
order
of
the
court
below
was
the
quashing
of
the
indictment
as
distinguished
from
a
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment
where
all
of
the
case
comes
into
effect,
we
probably
maybe
dealing
with
the
sole
question
of
these
averments
of
the
indictment
which
do
specifically
aver
the
overthrow
of
pennsylvania,
the
government
of
pennsylvania
as
well
as
that
of
the
united
states.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
we
are
confronted
to
some
extent
as
to
whether
or
not
a
state
can
proscribe
against
acts
of
sedition
such
as
our
--
instigated
here.
can
a
state
make
it
a
crime
to
commit
acts
in
its
territory,
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states?
now,
your
honors,
it
had
recently
a
number
of
these
cases
before
you.
there's
hardly
as
single
case
in
which
some
justice
is
now
sitting
upon
this
bench
has
not
made
some
reference
in
an
opinion
that
could
be
quoted
back
with
respect
to
this
situation
that
we
have
facing
us
here
today.
but
i
want
to
refer,
your
honors,
to
three
important
cases
that
i
think
that
are
all
controlling
in
this
situation.
and
the
first
one
is
the
case
of
gitlow
against
new
york.
there,
there
was
a
statute
somewhat
the
same
as
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
with
the
distinction
that
there,
there
was
to
be
an
overthrowing
or
overturning
of
the
organized
government
by
force
and
violence.
here,
it
was
the
overthrowing
of
pennsylvania
and
the
government
of
the
united
states.
the
gitlow
case,
after
conviction
and
appeals,
finally
reach
this
court.
justice
sanford
said
in
his
opinion,
“and
the
state
may
penalize
utterances
which
openly
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
representative
and
the
constitutional
form
of
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
several
states
by
violence
or
other
unlawful
meanings.”
in
short,
this
freedom
(does
not
deprive
a
state
of
the
primary
and
essential
right
of
self-preservation
which
so
long
as
human
governments
endure,
they
cannot
be
denied).
now,
there
was
a
similar
statute
in
california.
that
statute
made
as
to
felony
for
anybody
to
become
a
member
of
an
organization
which
advocated
unlawful
acts
of
force
and
violence
as
a
means
of
accomplishing
in
--
a
change
in
industrial
ownership
or
any
political
change.
this
court
said
in
that
case
that
a
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power
may
punish
those
who
abuse
this
freedom
by
utterances
and
amicable
to
the
public
welfare
pending
to
incite
the
crime,
disturb
the
public
peace
or
endanger
the
foundations
of
organized
government
and
threaten
its
overthrow
by
unlawful
means
is
not
open
to
question.
now,
in
those
two
cases,
there
has
been
some
aspersion
cast
upon
them
in
the
--
and
particularly
in
the
opinion
of
the
learned
justice
below
to
the
effect
that
there
was
not
at
the
time
that
they
were
decided
any
federal
act
in
effect
and
that
is
true.
the
sedition
act
of
1918
had
been
repealed
in
1921.
but
with
respect
to
those
two
cases,
the
utterances
were
charged
to
have
been
made
on
november
the
28th,
1919
and
july
the
5th,
1919.
and
at
the
time
that
they
were
charged
to
have
been
made,
the
sedition
act
was
still
in
effect
and
i
submit
that
if
the
state
law
had
been
nullified,
this
court
would
not
have
confirmed
the
convictions
in
those
cases.
but
there
is
a
case
that
was
decided
by
this
court
and
which
there
can
be
absolutely
no
question
about
a
federal
act
being
in
full
force
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the
conviction
was
held
and
at
the
time
that
the
appeal
was
heard
in
this
court.
in
that
case
is
gilbert
against
minnesota.
in
gilbert
against
minnesota,
there
was
a
minnesota
statute
making
it
as
a
misdemeanor
to
advocate
that
citizens
of
the
state
should
not
aid
or
assist
the
united
states
in
prosecuting
or
carrying
on
a
war.
at
the
time
that
gilbert
was
convicted,
the
federal
espionage
act
was
in
full
force
in
effect.
it
was
argued
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
argued
impractically
to
every
court
and
it
was
presented
in
this
court
that
the
federal
espionage
act
which
prohibited
the
same
acts
of
the
minnesota
act
prohibited
superseded
and
preempted
and
occupied
the
field
so
that
the
minnesota
act
did
not
have
any
force
or
--
or
effect.
this
court
held,
the
statute
indeed
maybe
supported
as
a
simple
exertion
of
the
police
power
to
preserve
the
peace
of
the
state.
it's
simply
a
local
police
major
aimed
to
suppress
a
species
of
seditious
speech
which
the
legislature
of
the
state
has
found
objectionable.
on
such
occasions,
feeling
usually
runs
high
and
is
impetuous.
there
is
a
prompting
to
violence
and
when
violence
has
once
yielded
too,
the
board
can
be
quelled.
tragedies
maybe
enacted
to
produce
such
a
result
or
the
danger
of
it
is
a
proper
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
state.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
bore
your
honors
with
any
more
quotations
from
your
cases.
chief
justice
jones
and
chief
justice
hughes
said
in
the
de
jonge
against
oregon
that
the
states
were
entitled
to
protect
themselves.
and
in
stromberg
against
california,
he
said
there
was
absolutely
no
question
of
what
the
states
could
do
and
pass
such
acts.
now,
these
particular
sedition
act
of
pennsylvania,
i
should
like
to
call
also
your
honors
attention,
has
been
constitutional
by
our
supreme
court
in
three
different
cases,
the
widowich
case,
the
zima
case,
and
the
lazar
case.
and
in
two
of
those
cases,
they
are
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
and
one,
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied
and
in
another,
the
appeal
was
dismissed.
there
had
been
similar
statutes.
in
other
states,
that
had
been
held
constitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
those
states.
one
of
the
cases
is
state
against
(inaudible)
of
new
jersey
and
the
other
is
the
recent
case
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
of
nelson
against
wyman.
now,
having
demonstrated
i
believe
that
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
several
decisions
of
our
state
courts
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
enact
a
sedition
act
of
this
common.
i
should
now
like
to
submit
to
your
honors
that
in
this
instant
case,
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
by
the
passage
of
the
smith
act,
the
superseded
or
preemptive
field
in
which
the
sedition
acts
operate
on
the
part
of
states.
first
of
all,
these
sedition
acts
in
the
states
and
territories
are
penal
laws.
they
are
laws
for
the
punishment
of
conduct
or
an
act
in
those
particular
territories.
this
is
not
the
case
like
the
cloverleaf
case
with
the
--
with
the
regulation
with
respect
to
butter.
it's
not
a
case
like
the
allen-bradley
local
of
labor
relations.
it's
not
a
case
of
regulations
with
respect
to
platforms
on
the
rear
part
of
railroads.
there
is
no
act
such
as
the
taft-hartley
act
involved
of
the
labor
relations
act
or
the
interstate
commerce
act
involved.
these
are
penal
laws
of
the
state
and
of
the
territory
has
by
the
duly
elected
representatives
of
the
people
of
those
states.
they
have
no
regulations
of
any
kind,
no
registration
mandates,
nothing
that
could
conflict.
they
are
merely
a
part
of
the
criminal
justice
of
each
state
and
each
territory
where
they
had
been
passed.
i
think
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
government
covers
that
subject
very
well.
he
says,
“these
are
ordinarily
--
ordinary
criminal
statutes
which
proscribe
completely
substantive
evils,
certain
types
of
conduct
and
create
a
substantive
crime
independently
of
any
administrative
or
statutory
regulation.
in
this
respect,
they
are
like
statutes
punishing
murder,
robbery
or
kidnapping
which
are
crimes
against
those
state
and
nation
where
every
elements
giving
rise
to
federal
jurisdiction
of
prison.
statutes
of
the
type
and
issues
do
not
contemplate
any
scheme
of
regulation.
they
do
not
establish
any
administrative
agency
with
power
to
issue
rules,
orders
or
regulations.
they
are
not
registration
statutes
with
the
tenant
administrative
requirement.
there
is,
therefore,
no
possibility
of
conflict
between
the
requirements
of
federal
and
state
administrative
regulations
coming
from
this
statute.
the
state
sedition
laws
are
ordinarily
--
ordinary
penal
laws
which
have
as
their
object
of
protection
of
the
established
government
of
the
state.
now,
very
early,
there
was
a
case
of
cohens
against
west
virginia
in
which
congress
passed
an
act
permitting
lottery
tickets
particularly
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
finance
certain
situations.
the
man
was
arrested
in
virginia
because
the
virginia
law
prohibited
to
the
lottery
--
the
lotteries.
chief
justice
marshall
said
that
to
interfere
with
the
penal
laws
of
the
state
where
they
are
not
leveled
against
the
legitimate
powers
of
union
that
have
for
their
sole
object,
the
internal
government
and
countries
of
very
serious
nature.
it
must
be
taken
deliberately
and
the
intention
would
be
clearly
and
unequivocally
expressed.
an
act
such
as
that
under
consideration
ought
not
we
think
to
be
so
considered
is
to
imply
this
intention
unless
its
provisions
were
such
as
to
render
the
construction
inevitable.
and
then
there
was
a
very
fine
dissertation
on
crime
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
malinski
against
new
york,
in
which
justice
frankfurter
says,
that
as
far
as
the
criminal
justice
is
concerned,
it
was
with
the
states.
it
was
reserved
to
the
states.
and
only
so
much
of
it
was
given
to
the
federal
government
as
it
was
necessary
for
it
to
efficaciously
carry
on
its
work
as
a
government.
and
that
remain
so
until
the
passage
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1868.
and
after
the
passage
of
that,
it
still
remained
that
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law
was
predominantly
with
the
states.
there
were
some
restrictions
in
the
making
and
the
enforcement
placed
upon
it
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
fact,
this
is
apart
from
permitting
congress
to
use
criminal
sanctions
as
a
means
for
carrying
into
execution
powers
granted
it,
the
constitution
left
the
domain
of
the
criminal
justice
to
the
states.
and
again,
rochin
against
california
in
342
u.s.,
he
says,
“in
our
federal
system,
the
administration
of
the
criminal
justice
is
predominantly
committed
to
the
care
of
the
states.
the
power
to
define
crimes
belongs
to
congress
only
as
an
appropriate
means
of
carrying
into
execution
its
limited
grant
of
legislative
powers.”
broadly
speaking,
crimes
in
the
united
states
or
what
the
laws
of
the
individual
states
make
them
subject
to
the
limitations
of
article
i
section
10,
clause
1
of
the
original
constitution
prohibiting
bills
of
attainder
and
ex
post
facto
laws
and
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
i
think
one
way
that
we
can
arrive
and
most
surely
at
the
intention
of
congress
in
this
case
is
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
a
case.
look
at
the
hearings
and
let
me
say
in
passing
that
in
all
--
our
investigation
shows
that
there
are
42
states,
alaska
and
hawaii
that
have
acts
similar
to
this
act
that's
involved
in
this
case
in
pennsylvania.
now,
they're
not
all
known
as
sedition
acts.
but
the
majority
of
them
by
a
good
bit
are
known
as
sedition
acts.
there
are
some
that
are
known
as
syndicalism
acts
and
some
that
are
known
as
anarchy
acts.but
in
all,
there
are
42
states
in
hawaii
and
alaska.
in
the
subcommittee
hearings
in
congress,
there's
a
great
awareness
that
shown
of
the
state
sedition
acts.
in
fact,
one
of
the
witnesses
in
the
subcommittee
hearing
testified
that
the
smith
act
was
modeled
after
the
new
york
state
act
and
he
mentioned
that
the
gitlow
case
had
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
that
the
new
york
state
act
had
been
held
constitutional.
in
the
debates,
reference
was
frequently
made
to
the
state
sedition
acts.
they
knew
that
they
were
in
existence.
and
when
the
sponsor
was
interrogated
on
the
floor
of
congress
concerning
the
discrepancy
between
the
penalty
and
some
of
the
state
acts
and
they
proposed
for
that,
they
answer
to
the
interrogation
by
saying,
“this
bill
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
state
acts.”
that's
the
84th
congressional
record
on
page
10,452.
then,
there
had
been
committees
of
congress
that
had
been
appointed
that
reported
with
respect
to
certain
activities
of
individuals
and
they
noted
in
a
report
filed
in
march
of
1950
and
in
a
report
filed
in
august
of
1950
that
the
sedition
acts
were
in
full
force
in
effect
and
they
spoke
about
the
activity
of
the
state
legislatures
with
respect
to
these
acts.
it
would
have
been
a
great
surprise
to
them.
congress
had
it
been
brought
to
their
attention
that
for
10
years
these
acts
that
they
were
reporting
on
had
been
nullified
by
an
act
which
they
passed
back
in
the
year
of
1940,
the
smith
act.
and
then
there's
the
title
of
the
act
itself.
now,
as
a
part
of
the
federal
criminal
code,
this
title
18,
section
32
and
31,
“nothing
in
this
title
shall
be
held
to
take
away
or
impair
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
several
states
under
the
laws
thereof.”
certainly,
that
language
is
a
specific
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
state
laws
are
at
least
not
to
be
nullified
by
influence.
nothing
in
this
title
is
to
take
away
or
impair.
now,
in
our
supreme
court,
quash
the
indictment
in
this
case
by
a
decision
of
one
judge
half-heartedly
joined
in
by
three
because
they
showed
some
misgiving
saying
that
it
ought
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
and
one
judge
very
vigorously
dissented
and
there
had
been
three
court
--
three
judges
in
lower
court
in
an
appellate
capacity
and
seven
judges
on
our
superior
court,
all
11
of
those
judges
held
that
there
was
no
supersession
in
this
case.
and
as
i
say
only
one
and
three
half-heartedly
joining
in
needless
to
say
the
justice
department,
that
i
happened
to
heeded
that
time,
was
somewhat
shocked.
it
was
enacted
by
our
own
legislature
with
one
justice,
three
joining
in,
nullifying
our
own
act.
and
i
decided
immediately
that
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
should
be
filed
and
i
did.
and
i
attached
to
that
a
letter
that
i
had
received
from
the
author
of
this
act,
mr.
representative
smith
himself,
and
so
it
is
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
and
justice
bell
has
included
it
in
his
opinion
when
the
petition
for
the
rehearing
denied.
honorable
frank
truscott,
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
frank
f.
truscott
i'm
reading
the
letter
that
the
sponsor,
that
the
author
of
this
bill
wrote
to
me
which
i
attached
to
the
petition
for
a
rehearing
in
our
supreme
court.
and
it's
a
part
of
the
opinion
--
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
honorable
frank
truscott,
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania,
department
of
justice
harrisburg,
pennsylvania,
“dear
mr.
attorney
general.
as
i
am
the
author
of
the
federal
act
in
question,
known
as
the
smith
act,
i
am
deeply
disturbed
by
the
implications
of
this
decision.
may
i
say
that
when
i
read
this
opinion,
it
was
the
first
intimation,
i
have
ever
had
either
in
the
preparation
of
the
act
in
the
hearings
before
the
judiciary
committee
in
the
debates,
in
the
house
or
any
subsequent
development
that
congress
ever
had
the
famous
notion
of
nullifying
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
respecting
--
respective
sovereign
states
to
pursue
also
their
own
prosecution
for
subversive
activities.
it
would
be
a
severe
handicap
to
the
successful
stamping
out
subversive
activities
if
no
state
authority
were
permitted
to
assist
in
the
elimination
of
this
evil
or
to
protect
its
own
sovereignty.
the
whole
tenor
and
purpose
of
the
smith
act
was
to
eliminate
subversive
activities,
not
to
a
system,
which
letter
might
well
be
the
effect
of
the
decision
in
the
case
of
commonwealth
against
nelson.
i
hope
you
will
not
think
me
presumptuous
in
taking
this
matter
up
with
you,
but
you
can
readily
understand
how
deeply
disturbed
i
am
about
it.
sincerely
yours,
howard
w.smith.”
i
have
only
to
point
out
in
connection
with
that,
that
this
is
not
an
ex
post
facto
letter.
this
is
a
letter,
which
says
that,
it's
the
first
intimation
i
have,
ever
had.
now,
he's
a
former
judge,
highly
respected
judge,
he
represents
the
eighth
district
and
has
for
a
long
time,
a
grand
public
servant
and
i
think
one
of
our
most
highly
thought
of
congressman,
writes
that
letter
that
this
is
the
first
intimation
that
he
ever
had
that
that
act
might
be
superseded.
now,
there
are
other
states
that
have
this
problem.
ohio,
it
has
an
act,
which
has
a
commission
to
ascertain
who
is
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
one
man
defied
the
commission
and
he
cited
the
case
of
commonwealth
against
nelson,
decided
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
said
the
act
it
didn't
--
nullified
because
the
smith
act
that
preempted
the
field,
that
the
higher
court
in
ohio,
followed
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
bell
in
this
case
and
said
they
would
not
follow
justice
jones'
opinion
or
the
concurring
opinion.
then,
as
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
some
time
here,
so
i'll
only
spend
just
one
minute
on
that.
but
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
said,
when
a
declaratory
judgment,
petition
was
filed
to
declare
the
--
their
act
which
is
very
similar
to
the
pennsylvania
act,
void
the
enactment
by
congress
of
the
smith
act,
which
defines
and
penalizes
sedition
and
subversive
activities
against
the
governments
of
the
united
states,
the
states
or
any
of
their
subdivisions,
does
not
preclude
state
legislation
on
the
same
subject
matter.
insofar
as
pennsylvania
against
nelson,
a
104
a.2d
133,
gives
support
to
the
proposition
that
it
does,
we
do
not
adopt
it.
two
states
have
found
for
the
opposite
from
what
the
learned
opinion
of
justice
jones,
the
--
the
opposite
conclusion
that
justice
jones
comes
to.
now,
just
one
--
two
brief
words
about
the
opinion
in
the
court
below.
it
is
--
it
is
seems
to
be
what
is
bolstered
by
four
main
propositions.
one
is
section
4
article
iv
of
the
constitution.
the
other
is
the
hines-davidowitz
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
not
too
long
ago.
the
gilbert-gitlow
and
whitney
cases,
which
are
distinguished
a
double
jeopardy
because
after
the
conviction
in
this
case,
it
is
the
truth.
in
fact,
the
man
was
prosecuted
in
the
federal
district
court
and
they
are
likewise
convicted.
and
also
justice
jones
feels
that
they
would
be
a
tremendous
hampering
of
the
federal
authorities.
now,
as
to
section
4,
article
iv
of
the
constitution,
it
reads
as
follows,
the
united
states
shall
not
--
shall
guarantee
that
every
state
in
this
union
or
republican
form
of
government
shall
protect
each
of
them
against
the
invasion
and
on
application
of
the
legislature
or
the
executive
when
the
legislature
cannot
be
convened
against
domestic
violence.
learned
justice
below
says,
federal
preemption
could
hardly
be
more
clearly
indicated.
well,
of
course,
as
the
famous
case
luther
against
borden
holds,
there
is
no
invasion
in
--
threatened
in
this
case.
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
a
republican
form
of
government
shall
protect
each
of
them
against
invasion.
there's
no
question
about
invasion
and
about
and
on
application
of
the
legislature
or
the
executive
against
domestic
violence.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
foregone
conclusion
if
the
legislature
or
the
executive
has
to
make
an
application
to
the
federal
government
for
assistance
where
there's
domestic
violence,
certainly,
it
must
be
assumed
that
they're
authorized
to
cope
with
it,
themselves,
until
it
gets
out
of
hand.
and
i
think
that
the
learned
justice
below
went
quite
for
our
appeal
when
he
thought
that
that
length,
of
some
credence
to
the
fact
that
the
appeal
had
been
preempted.
now,
the
hines-davidowitz
case,
that
was
the
case
that
came
up
from
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
too,
that's
relied
on
very
heavily
in
the
court
below
and
it's
relied
upon
by
my
friend
most
heavily,
he
says
that
there
are
two
cases
that
governed
this.
number
one
is
the
hines
against
davidowitz.
but
hines
against
davidowitz
was
an
entirely
different
proposition.
hines
against
davidowitz
was
enact
that
we
had
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
that
compelled
the
registration
of
aliens.
and
there
was
a
federal
act
that
compelled
the
registration
of
aliens,
and
as
this
court
said,
here
is
an
all
embracing
far
reaching
integrated
system
for
the
registration
of
aliens.
and
it
has
an
international
application.
we
think
that
that
is
purely
a
national
subject,
a
subject
which
congress
should
be
allowed
alone
to
deal
with
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
field
has
been
preempted.
now,
with
respect
to
that,
hines
against
davidowitz
has
been
absolutely
limited
to
the
facts
and
narrowed
down
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
case,
which
i've
quoted
on
page
48
of
my
brief.
in
the
hines
case,
a
federal
system
that
the
alien
registration
was
held
to
supersede
a
state
system
of
--
of
registration,
but
there,
we
were
dealing
with
the
problem
which
had
an
impact
on
the
general
field
of
foreign
relations.
here,
we
are
dealing
with
the
letter
type
of
problem,
which
is
the
historic
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
states
can
legislate
with
respect
to
public
safety
and
order
and
the
use
of
their
streets
and
highways.
and
then
it
was
distinguished
by
his
honor
justice
--
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
the
allen-bradley
local
case
and
said
that
they
are
the
international
relations
aspect
of
the
case,
limited
that
case,
(inaudible)
they
should
--
no
one
should
think
that
the
states
had
lost
their
right
of
police
power
in
matters
where
there
was
not
that
implication.
now,
i
see
have
a
bit
few
minutes
left
of
my
time.
i've
awarded
15
minutes
of
my
time
to
my
colleague
to
respond
and
answer
after
the
respondent's
attorney
spoken.
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
four
votings
of
the
court
below
that
enforcement
by
the
states
of
their
sedition
acts
would
interfere
with
the
federal
enforcement.
it
seemed
to
be
absolutely
unfounded.
two
people
in
the
united
states
have
probably
know
more
about
that
than
any
two
other
individuals
or
the
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general.
and
they
both,
one
says
unmistakably
in
his
brief,
that
for
15
years,
the
state
have
operated
alongside
of
the
federal
government
in
the
enforcement
of
these
acts
and
that
there's
been
no
difficulty
and
that
they've
gone
down
through
the
stress
of
time
of
two
wars.
and
that
they
have
had
no
--
no
difficulty
at
all
and
they
think
that
the
states
should
cooperate
with
the
federal
government.
and
he
says
that
the
assumption
in
the
court
below
is
absolutely
unfounded.
i
just
want
to
say
one
more
word,
we
have
the
city
police,
we
have
the
bureau
police,
and
we
have
the
township
police,
we
have
the
sheriff,
we
have
the
right
of
any
city
executive
to
call
upon
the
governor
from
malaysia.
we
have
all
of
the
facilities
for
the
enforcement.if
there
is
a
crime
being
hatched
where
there
might
be
a
great
destruction
of
property,
a
great
loss
of
life,
the
police
are
present
to
detect
it.
with
our
national
government,
we
have
no
such
facility.
the
fbi
which
is
very
efficient
says
itself,
that's
it's
only
an
information
gathering
agency.
it
isn't
spread
through
out
the
entire
48
states
of
the
union.
if
congress
ever
intended
to
take
away
from
the
states
their
right
of
self-preservation,
certainly,
they
would
have
set
up
some
kind
of
machinery
to
cope
with
the
situation
that
they
did
not
do.
now,
with
respect
to
the
element
of
punishment
on
this
case,
it
can
be
much
more
serious
in
some
cases
than
it
can
in
others.
we
are
highly
industrialized
community
to
hatch
out
and
--
and
encourage
people
to
overthrow
the
government
of
pennsylvania
or
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence
in
the
plans
that
we
have
in
the
pittsburg
area
and
the
philadelphia
area,
known
as
the
arsenal
of
democracy
might
be
far
more
serious
than
if
it
took
place
somewhere
in
the
black
hills
of
north
dakota.
therefore,
a
sentence
in
pennsylvania
were
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
could
be
felt
and
where
effect
of
it
would
be
a
far
more
serious
than
with
the
elsewhere
might
call
for
a
more
serious
sense.
and
certainly,
there
should
be
no
uniformity
in
a
matter
of
this
kind.
