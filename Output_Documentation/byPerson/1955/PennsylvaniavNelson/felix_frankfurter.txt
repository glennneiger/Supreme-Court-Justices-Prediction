justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
you're
reading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
if
i
make
the
duty
of
attorney
general
is
to
decide
to
state
a
law
as
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
have
a
moment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
use
the
word
comprehensive
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
will
be
in
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he'd
be
given
this
request
of
the
--
would
you
straighten
out
the
(inaudible)
through
the
scope
of
the
--
in
addition
to
prohibition
of
your
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
given
the
date,
now
on
page
15
of
your
brief,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
we
must
assume
the
purpose
of
the
present
case
that
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
was
to
repeal
the
smith
act
on
that
means
that
january
it
would
have
been
able
to
come
in.
is
this
true?
i
think
that
still
could
still
turn
on
the
board.
that
the
validity
of
the
statute
or
right
to
publicity,
we
must
assume
that
one
of
these
acts,
in
this
case
wouldn't
be
here
in
this
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
matter
of
the
three
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
turn
in,
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
--
that
for
these
various
offenses
as
one
should
say,
perhaps
the
case
what
gives
to
the
other
in
federal
courts
for
various
cases
the
transaction
in
congress
for
activities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible),
the
problem
arises
on
the
subject
is
really
something.
it
depends
in
the
--
during
the
--
have
you
finally
gotten
on
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
the
nelson
case
is
against
the,
if
you
look
at
it,
court
--
in
a
certain
court
in
violation
of
the
united
states
but
presumably
a
certain
proposition
but
there's
no
presumption
that
as
to
the
cases
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
both?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
so
that
this
is
a
situation
i'm
sure
that
we
derive
under
your
statute
a
situation
that
congress
in
activity
which
could
in
the
case
which
you
have
is
must
quickly
draw
(inaudible)
or
to
your
--
or
in
the
state
court
officers
in
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
you
this,
attorney
general.
i
may
be
asking
you
a
question
that
you
will
be
well
and
really
are
for
propriety
(inaudible),
all
those
reasons
in
this
case,
we
have
to
get
the
role
that
you
have
that
which
(inaudible)
would
you
be
free
of
--
would
you
sketch
how
you
go
about
discharging
either
reach
of
the
two
courts
or
whether
in
both
courts
could
be
found?what
will
you
be
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
federal
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
national
bank?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
will
be
also
stated
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
better
than
a
state
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
had
the
best
(inaudible)
interrogatory
of
the
statute
in
taking
the
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
--
the
law
that
the
special
action
fund
makes
you
(inaudible)
of
national
bank
and
also
teach,
teach
also,
leave
the
application
before
the
general
as
you
offer
statutes.
that
just
happens.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
really
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
guess
in
the
house
of
the
family
is
a
complicated
unit
here,
another
federal
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
you
--
would
you
go
on
for
that
and
decide
not
to
be
convicted,
but
before,
here
--
here
is
the
--
the
congress
that's
making
a
(inaudible)
for
the
authority
you
invoke
of
the
state
in
the
federal
government.
what
happens
if
you
sit
down
and
(inaudible)
and
try
who
has
a
better
evidence
through
the
more
--
what
judge
is
more
desirable
to
form
in
five
years.
so
they're
all
relevant
in
consideration
to
prosecute
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
is,
what
is
--
i
don't
understand
what
cooperation
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
u.s.
attorney
of
new
hampshire
has
power
below
this
case
in
developing
this
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it
comes
or
what
i
meant
is
this
is
how
the
two
(inaudible)
and
i
will
decide
who
should
go
ahead
or
they
should
go
in
contemporaneously.
am
i
to
understand
where
the
--
that
it
was
directed
opinion
of
the
bureau
of
federal
investigation
from
helping
you
with
evidence
to
a
proposition
that
comes
in
schedule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
say
what
you
said
about
the
--
the
prohibition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
--
even
if
it's
the
same
prosecution
like
the
nelson
on
what
is
going
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barber
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
but
i
must
--
i
must
concede
that
by
asking
you
is
i'm
having
you
to
state
so
i
understand
the
scope
of
what
you
told
us
a
little
while
ago
about
the
absent
of
conflict
between
federal
and
the
state
authority
that
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
actually
on
the
vehicle
of
what
(inaudible)
responsibility
as
tot
the
state.
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
no
conflict
has
developed
there
between
federal
and
state
authority.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
--
was
that
--
that
report
which
you've
given
us
that
of
--
as
of
the
present,
if
it's
a
--a
statement
as
of
today
looking
back
on
the
past?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
[laughter]
--
i
commend
your
respect
to
accuracy,
evidently.
in
other
words,
if
the
statement,
any
post
mortem
(inaudible)
is
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
like
to
put
this
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and,
infer
this
that
the
trouble
entirely.mr.
justice
harlan
brought
us
back
a
minute
ago
to
the
--
to
the
question
of
this
case.
namely,
we
have
a
statute
of
congress.
we
have
state
laws
and
the
question
is,
whether
statute
of
congress
has
displaced
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
that's
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
relevant
from
that,
certainly
is
not
what
a
legislature
of
15
years
after
his
proposal
and
is
enacted,
think
they
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
for
that
kind
of
thing,
i
can't
imagine
a
worst
chaos
and
that
legislative
covered
15
years
later
what
they
thought
they
had
in
their
heads.
they
--
they
wouldn't
know
today
what
they
had
in
their
heads.
these
would
be
in
their
foot
if
they
didn't
know.
now,
secondly
as
to
this
information,
i
should
like
you
to
probably
ask
all
about
it,
and
i
haven't.
is
it
relevant?
is
it
present?
is
it
proper?
i
don't
mean
improper
model,
but
is
it
proper
for
us
to
consider
what
an
administrative
official
thinks
has
been
or
has
not
been
the
working
of
a
team
of
legislation
when
we're
called
upon
to
decide
whether
this
act
in
1940
is
clinging
to
that
insofar
as
state
is
--
state
is
concerned
and
it's
taking
the
field
wholly
for
the
federal
government.
now,
to
me,
that
raises
a
very
serious
question.
i
just
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
we
have
to
be
told
when
questions
like
these
arise
that
whoever
was
temporary
--
we're
all
temporary
in
this
world
--
the
official
may
be
for
whatever
reason,
he
comes
and
tells
us
(inaudible)
is
that
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
i
admitted
freely
that
during
your
duty
in
my
view
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
doing
it
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
my
point
of
view
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
my
worry
is
a
little
beyond
the
remoteness
isn't
merely
the
question
of
remoteness.but
was
the
best
of
intention
is
the
best
of
motion.
public
officials
have
different
interests
as
to
mode.
they
have
different
convictions
that
they
have
and
generally
our
law
is
wisely
(inaudible)
suppose
more
than
likely
a
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barber
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
ask
whether
your
study
of
these,
to
me,
very
troublesome
supersession
problems,
you
have
found
that
when
this
court
has
concluded
that
a
federal
act
as
this
has
displaced
it
or
displaced
it
with
state
laws
that
there
was
very
explicit
manifestation
by
congress
that
such
should
be
the
result,
rather
than
a
study
by
this
court
for
the
consideration
of
the
implication,
the
full
implications
of
our
federal
statutes.
that
on
the
whole,
it
is
important
that
a
federal
law
to
be
exclusively
governed,
the
transaction
means
to
a
particular
field
even
though
the
local
law
may
be
supporting
us
or
it
may
be
accordance
with
the
federal
court.
i
remind
since
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
familiar
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
i
believe
to
be
incontestable
that
there
wasn't
the
slightest
indication
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
congress
ever
thought
of
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
making
the
statement.
so,
not
the
slightest.
the
court's
founded
in
that
fact.
and
i
found
from
the
decision
of
this
court
what
is
there.
but
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
challenged
and
this
should
be
obvious
reading.
that
there
was
the
slightest
indication
that
congress
--
that
the
state
all
go
to
sleep.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
was
looking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
into
myself
merely
to
the
question
of
how
this
court
has
to
go
about
it
finding
whether
the
--
whether
the
state
law
should
appeal
this
and
--
and
this
is
my
impression
or
the
impression
left
on
my
mind,
when
i
did
go
through
those
cases
that
on
the
whole,
one
has
to
do
--
the
court
does
precisely
what
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
cloverleaf
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
cloverleaf,
it
did
what
it
did
in
kelly
and
the
opinion
by
chief
justice
(inaudible)
it
examined
all
the
statute
because
there
wasn't
any
light
except
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
came
out,
contrariwise.
and
he
said
yes,
we
cannot
say
that
the
federal
act
displaces
the
local
one
in
the
court
of
washington
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
lot
of
times
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
means
to
the
--
not
so
much
for
criteria
but
the
process
by
which
this
court
has
to
make
the
accommodation
between
state
law
and
federal
--
under
federal
law
dealing
with
the
same
subject
matter
when
we
get
no
light
from
so-called
intention
of
congress
except
what
the
statute
themselves
furnish.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
test
on
the
early
cases
about
counterfeiting
way
back
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
way
back.
it's
one
of
civil
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
--
that's
a
different
situation.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
have
the
state
that
the
--
the
single
act
may,
of
course,
singled
physically
kind
of
act
that
may
be
you
can
take
from
a
killer
man
or
you
may
block
or
you
will
distract
--
through
mail
carrier,
the
carrying
of
mail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
the
new
hampshire
statute
or
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
a
carbon
copy
of
the
smith
act
roughly
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
differs
from
the
fox
againts
whatever
it
was
and
also
the
duke
situation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
suppose
the
state
--
i
--
i
don't
quite
see
why
he's
so
--
from
your
point
of
view,
why
he
is
so
convincingly
felt
they'd
basically
say
no
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question.
assume
the
state
treason
statute
is
in
terms
the
basis
of
the
characterization
of
it
in
the
federal
constitution,
assume
the
same
requirement
as
to
quantum
of
proof,
et
cetera.
why
do
--
i
assume
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
still
say
no,
why
do
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
due
process
when
you
say
you're
punishing
for
an
act
not
committed
within
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
examined
the
indictment
in
both
in
applications?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
--
i
have
i
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
the
state
and
the
federal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
--
this
is
the
nelson
which
case
is
now
before
this
court
for
conviction
absence
requirements
of
the
conviction
is
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
i've
examined
these
are
indictments
but
i
would
like
to
know
if
the
indictment
is
substantially
proclaimed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
they
need
--
(inaudible)
to
sustain
them
through
the
anti-riot
statute
--
does
it
need
to
be
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
pennsylvania
they
might
kind
of
report
by
you
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
know
but
i
don't.
what
is
the
situation
of
the
punishment?
are
they
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
recommended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
federal
prosecution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
(inaudible)
i
hear
you
say
that
the
punishment
in
the
argument,
the
punishment
is
not
very
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
is
that
you
wouldn't
care
if
it
was
the
same,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
since
they're
not
the
same,
why
do
you
say
it's
unimportant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
justice
warn
him
in
the
houston
lower
courts
has
(inaudible)
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
but
in
your
case
that
is
not
the
situation
where
you
don't
decide
anymore.
why
are
you
so
generous
in
throwing
away
that
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
(inaudible)
do
you
have
to,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
common
--
that's
enough
to
take
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
as
to
the
part
when
it's
permitted
to
rationalize
(inaudible)
the
assumption
of
the
police
that
under
the
(inaudible)
decision
was
that
in
that
case,
the
california
statute
to
reveal
that
--
that
the
subject
matter
predominantly
incorporates
and
therefore
since
they
are
not
to
infer
that
congress
meant
to
see
what
is
your
controlling
of
local
agents
although
it's
a
matter
of
constitution
of
law,
it
was
also
dealing
with
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
the
theory
and
here's
the
choice
that
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
general
that
was
in
the
penal
code
of
1911?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
that.
but
the
--
you're
giving
it
superiority
on
the
position.
i
do
not
gather
from
what
you've
said
(inaudible)
in
the
question
of
what
is
the
function
of
that
purposely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
this
clarity
have
mattered
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
would
be
the
most
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
superfluous,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
must
refer
to
something
in
which
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
your
panel
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
begin.
i
think
that
begins
a
reserve.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
failure,
it
doesn't
give
quite
--
what
doesn't
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
if
this
court
decides
that
there
--
that
there
is
no
authority
of
the
state
court
and
this
court
has
stated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
just
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
johnson's
opinion,
used
against
the
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
the
president
of
the
united
states
were
to
pardon
nelson
for
the
--
on
his
conviction
in
the
federal
court
will
he
have
to
continue
to
serve
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
cloverleaf?
is
that
the
security
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
cloverleaf?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it?
there
wasn't
even
a
federal
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
federal
act
didn't
touch
this,
what
the
state
dealt
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
you
frankly
urged
the
liberty
of
the
statute
and
the
--
the
life
despite
the
smith
act
on
that
basis
and
not
because
it's
the
state
law
dealing
with
violence
or
riot
or
anything
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
you
--
you
don't
say
that
the
law
was
misdescribed
or
--
or
mislabeled
that
is
--
this
is
really
a
more
(inaudible)
in
pennsylvania.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
you
have
statutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
which
pennsylvania
asserted
the
right
and
prosecutes
people
who
seek
to
overthrow
or
(inaudible)
commonwealth
and
pennsylvania
by
force
and
violence,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
if
that
is
so,
that
--
basically
to
repeat
the
question
i
put
to
the
attorney
general
(inaudible),
namely,
if
the
particular
provision
dealing
with
the
burden
that
you
show
the
pattern
of
words,
were
deemed
to
have
been
supplanted
by
the
federal
act,
would
there
be
anything
left
with
your
statute?
are
there
other
provisions
which
could
operate
which
are
not
overlaps
of
--
of
the
smith
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
been
from
the
beginning
of
the
country's
history
that
congress
had
authorized
state
court
from
the
beginning
until
today,
state
courts
are
amenable
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
congress,
they
decide
either
divest
the
(inaudible)
federally
created
crime
in
the
federal
courts
exclusively
or
invoked
the
federal
court
or
state
court
or
exclusively
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
--
this
is
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
washington
who
gave
you
this
conclusion.
at
the
conclusion,
that
the
--
what
the
pennsylvania
act
on
what
congress
did
was
to
utilize
the
pennsylvania
courts
as
vehicles
for
enforcing
federal
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
but
that's
the
way
you
spelled
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
i
--
all
i'm
saying
is
--
suggesting
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
those
statutes
in
--
in
order
to
avoid
declaring
the
finding
unconstitutionality,
the
courts
did
or
rather
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
i
agree
with
the
preview
there
because
mr.
justice
johnson,
the
usual
figure,
through
the
first
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
thought
there
was
no
trouble
in
both
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
by
your
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
he
needs
to
(inaudible)
