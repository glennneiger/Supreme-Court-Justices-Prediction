when
were
those
of
the
dates
about
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
although
the
best
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
they
are
substantial.
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
the
attorney
general
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
hence
the
case
was
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
mr.
barber.
justice
harold
burton
isn't
it
quite
consistent
to
say
that
this
kind
of
a
subject
calls
for
national
supervision
and
national
enforcement
and
then
at
the
same
time
have
a
policy
that
there
is
no
objection
to
states
also
doing
something
about
it?
justice
harold
burton
the
mere
fact
it
demands
national
control
it
doesn't
mean
the
exclusive
control.
justice
harold
burton
well
it
is,
is
what
you're
saying
that
merely
because
the
state
uses
the
word
sedition
against
the
united
states
in
the
statute
that
that's
what
makes
it?
justice
harold
burton
i
--
i
don't
quite
catch
the
difference
between
the
--
justice
harold
burton
--
the
authority
to
stop
acts
of
sedition
because
they'll
make
a
breach
of
peace
and
not
being
able
to
punish
for
seditions
directly
against
united
states.
justice
harold
burton
why
so?
justice
harold
burton
a
serious
breach
of
peace
like
murder
for
instance?
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
--
depends
on
a
breach
of
peace?
is
murder
a
breach
of
peace?
justice
harold
burton
what
other
cases
are
you
referring
to
when
you
say
that
it
must
be
a
grant
of
power
by
congress.
is
that
the
(inaudible)
wagon
company?
justice
harold
burton
mr.
thatcher,
when
congress
reenacted
1948
of
title
18
u.s.c.which
the
smith
act
was
a
part,
the
title
to
that
act
explicitly
provided
that
nothing
in
this
title
shall
be
held
to
take
away
or
repeal
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
several
states
under
the
laws
therefore.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
no,
i
understand,
but
it
was
part
of
the
title
of
3231.
justice
harold
burton
that's
right.
