mr.
david
w.
robinson
if
the
court
please,
if
i
may
take
a
few
moments
with
the
facts
before
we
get
in
to
the
law.
twin
city,
in
1901,
formed
these
two
corporations.
one
in
south
carolina
and
one
in
georgia,
and
obtained
the
necessary
state
authority
to
build
dams
in
this
area
of
the
savannah
river,
comprising
about
11
miles.
they
bought
something
less
than
5000
acres
of
land
and
obtained
six
acts
of
congress
between
that
date
and
1919
authorizing
the
construction
of
dams
at
the
lower
end
of
the
site,
price's
island
and
the
other
places
there.
this
land
was
the
gorge
of
this
savannah
river.
it
is
the
steepest
portion
of
that
involved
in
the
37-mile
lake
which
is
clark
hill,
about
60
feet
of
the
fall
that
owns
twin
city
property
on
the
mainstem
of
the
river.
its
reservoir
area
included
no
buildings,
houses,
roads,
anything
that
would
add
to
the
cost
of
development.
it
composes
about
88%
of
the
drainage
area
which
goes
by
clark
hill.
and,
on
the
twin
city
property,
some
45%
of
the
fall
in
the
river,
which
clark
hill
has
gathered
in
its
130-foot
head
dam,
is
involved.
for
many
years,
twin
city
itself
attempted
to
develop
this
profit.
it
also,
from
time
to
time,
negotiated
with
other
parties.
it
was
considered
in
1912
when
stevens
creek
was
built
just
below.
it
was
considered
in
1916
when
the
nitrate
plant
was
finally
put
at
muscle
shoals.
the
record
shows
that
the
secretary
of
war
proved
the
twin
city
plants.
a
preliminary
permit
was
tendered
to
it
by
the
power
commission.
and,
then,
in
the
area
between
1928
and
1932,
when
the
savannah
river
electric
had
a
federal
power
license
to
build,
they
negotiated
and
condemnation
proceedings
were
started
by
savannah
river
electrics.
savannah
river
electric
was
one
of
the
commonwealth
and
southern
companies.
the
depression
caused
it
to
surrender
its
license.
the
--
the
property
is
well
located
with
reference
to
a
river.
twin
city
owned
the
land
to
come
out
to
the
sea
in
w.
c.
railroad.
it
owned
its
transmission
right
away
into
augusta.
and
throughout
the
last
20
or
25
years,
all
the
government
agencies
who
have
checked
this
have
treated
this
property
as
being
best
used
for
hydroelectric
purposes,
either
by
itself
or
in
conjunction
with
larger
areas
which,
now,
go
to
make
up
the
clark
hill
reservoir.
and,
the
courts
below
have
found
that
this
hydroelectric
use
was
its
best
use,
that
its
probability
for
use
in
that
was
so
probable
as
to
affect
the
market
value
under
the
usual
definitions
of
eminent
domain
law,
and
that
a
party
would
have
taken
that
into
consideration
if
it
had
engaged
in
negotiations
with
the
party.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1947,
when
the
government
started
these
condemnation
proceedings,
twin
city
was
negotiating
again
the
savannah
river
electric
to
sale
to
it.
savannah
river
electric
had
applied
to
the
federal
power
commission
for
a
license.
the
commission
had
held
that,
because
of
the
flood
control
act
of
1944,
that
it
should
not
issue
a
license
to
savannah
river,
but
should
permit
the
government
to
build.
it
was
different
from
the
chapman
case
in
that
respect.
and,
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
the
federal
power
commission's
determination.
twin
city's
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
pass
on
the
power
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
grant
the
license,
but
held
that
the
power
commission
had
properly
exercised
its
discretion
in
not
doing
it.
the
--
the
twin
city
properties
alone
were
economically
feasible
for
development
at
various
heads.
the
government
did
not
dispute
that.
we
brought
in
expert
engineers
who
testified
on
that
basis.
the
government's
testimony
was
that
a
better
project
was
to
put
twin
city
in
as
a
part
of
clark
hill.
and,
their
witnesses
testified
that
clark
hill,
at
that
time,
was
one
of
the
two
best
projects
east
of
the
mississippi,
the
other
being
the
buggs
island
project
with
which
this
court
had
some
reference
in
the
ronographics
case.
we
approach
this
as
our
testimony
and
the
court
so
held
on
the
basis
of
market
value,
taking
into
consideration
the
usual
definition
of
market
value
which
includes,
not
merely
the
use
to
which
the
property
is
already
put,
but
any
potential
use
which
is
so
probable
as
to
affect
the
market
value.
now,
that
language
was
used
by
you
in
the
olson
case,
which
is
a
case
on
all-fours
with
us,
involving,
as
you
probably
recall,
the
lake
of
the
wood,
and
in
which
the
united
states
was
interested
in
navigation.
the
--
the
dam
was
to
be
in
canada
and
the
united
states
was
condemning
an
aid
of
that
project,
but
its
interest
was
navigation.
the
court
held
that
the
landowner
had
not
made
out
the
factual
showing,
of
showing
probability.
but,
they
laid
down
the
law
which
the
lower
courts
followed
then.
that
is
to
say
that
if
the
factual
situation
is
that
of
this
potential
use,
being
so
reasonable
as
to
affect
market
value,
it
is
a
part
of
the
market
value.
and,
that
is
the
approach
which
we
have.
now,
the
award
here
is
not
excessive.
it's
less
than
one-half
of
the
acre
value
which
was
awarded
in
grand
dam.
it's
about
the
national
average
of
land
value
per
kilowatts,
as
the
federal
power
commission
approached
this.
it's
about
50%
less
for
a
kilowatt
in
stock
of
kilowatt
than
the
same
t-system,
just
north
of
the
savannah
river
and
which
is
the
most
comparable
system
there.
now,
we
don't
dispute
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
build
this
project.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
fifth
amendment.
there
are
probably
several
powers
under
the
constitution
under
which
the
government
could
build.
certainly,
they
could
build
under
the
general
welfare
since
united
states
against
butler
and
some
of
the
other
decisions.it
probably
can
also
build
under
the
commerce
power,
which
is
not
limited
to
navigation.
but,
we
say
that,
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
is
relieved
from
paying
just
compensation
or
that
part
of
the
just
compensation
attributable
to
this
feasibility
for
use
with
the
river
for
power
development
because
of
the
navigation
servitude.
the
navigation
servitude
is
much
narrower
than
the
commerce
power,
as
you
said
in
the
kansas
city
case.
and,
to
relieve
the
government
of
the
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
pay
just
compensation
requires
something
more
than
a
finding
that
united
states
is
entitled
to
build
this
project
and
to
operate.
and,
so,
we
go
into
the
army
engineer's
report,
copies
of
which
we
have
had
reproduced
in
court,
which
is
involved
in
the
statute
to
see
what
the
united
states
actually
did
here.
you
have
the
entire
document
before
you
and,
so
as
--
i
don't
want
to
go
into
detail,
but
i
do
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
chief
of
engineers,
in
making
this
report,
says
that
the
clark
hill
project
is
to
be
operated
primarily
for
hydroelectric
development,
on
page
3
of
the
report,
with
incidental
flood
control
and
navigation
of
benefits.
in
paragraph
8,
that
he
also
finds
that
perspective
benefits
would
not
justify
the
provision
of
reservoir
storage
space
exclusively
for
flood
control,
but
that
clark
hill,
if
suitably
constructed
and
operated
primarily
for
hydroelectric
power,
would
incidentally
reduce
downstream
flood
damages
and
improve
low
water
flows
below
augusta.
now,
on
the
cost
basis,
the
estimate
cost
was
$37
million.
and
it
actually
cost
about
$77
million.
the
engineers
and
sales
allocated
96%
of
the
cost
to
power
and
4%
to
navigation
and
flood
control.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
i
--
i
would
say
that,
there,
if
the
main
purpose
of
this
was
navigation,
real
navigation,
the
government
would
be
relieved
of
one
branch
of
our
argument,
being
--
that
is
to
say,
there
would
be
an
execution
of
the
navigation
servitude.
it
would
not
answer
the
other
problem
we
have
that
the
navigation
servitude
doesn't
apply
to
lands
above
high
water
mark.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
but,
it
would
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
the
relevance
of
it
is
that
we
have
a
two-pronged
position.
one
taken
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
one
taken
by
the
fourth
circuit,
if
i
may
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
that's
what
the
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
the
fourth
circuit,
in
effect,
said
that
this
is
highland
that
the
government
took
and,
therefore,
the
navigation
servitude
applying
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
only,
these
people
are
entitled,
twin
city
is
entitled
to
the
market
value
of
the
highland
which
includes
this
potential
for
use
with
the
used
proximity
value
to
the
river.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
and
the
companion
case
is
here
on
petition,
the
fifth
circuit
said
this
is
not
a
navigation
project
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
navigation
servitude
whatsoever.
we
submit
that
if
either
court
is
right,
we
are
entitled
to
prevail
on
him.
and,
for
that
reason,
i
was
making
the
fifth
circuit
argument
which
is
really
and
technically
not
before
you
but
is
here
on
petition.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
i
--
i
think,
in
this
respect,
he
was
and,
because
we
know
that
you
have
the
opinion
of
judge
hudson,
as
well
of
judge
parker's,
opinion
that
both
of
the
--
propositions
should
be
argued.
now,
we
say
that,
to
execute
the
navigation
servitude
in
the
sense
that
the
government
is
relieved
from
pain,
there
must
be
a
real
practical
navigation
purpose
affected,
not
merely
enough
to
justify
government
construction
or
government
operation.
and,
that's
the
reason
i
call
attention
to
the
percentages.
we
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
clark
hill
is
to
be
operated
at
a
25%
load
factor.
the
army
engineer
report
show
so
--
shows
a
government
witness
of
the
case
so
testified.
that
means
that
the
water
would
be
released
to
the
equivalent
to
25%,
at
the
time
during
the
times
of
high
demand
when
power
is
worth
more.
now,
of
course,
any
project
as
large
as
clark
hill
can
benefit
navigation
downstream,
depending
on
its
operation.
but,
a
25%
load
factor
hurts
navigation
or,
if
you're
going
to
operate
it
that
way,
it
rather
than
helps
it,
unless
you
can
do
something
about
it.
now,
the
government
proposed
that
they
would
require
this
privately
owned
stevens
creek
dam
to
reregulate
the
flow
from
clark
hill.
then,
it
would
be
too
big
a
sacrifice
in
the
interest
of
navigation
for
clark
hill
to
operate
around
the
clock.
many
of
those
hours,
the
power
wouldn't
be
worth
anything.
so,
the
fact
that
clark
hill
is
to
operate
at
25%
load
factor
is
an
indication
that
the
practical
navigation
is
not
important.
also,
in
the
report,
these
seven
other
projects
upstream
are
all
referred
to
as
hydroelectric
projects.
they
have
no
navigation
phases
in
it
themselves.
and,
there's
very
little
flood
control
in
it,
as
you
will
find
on
page
3
here
of
the
army
engineers
report.
they
didn't
even
think
it's
important
enough
to
have
any
reservoir
space
for
flood
control.
the
practical
reason
is
that
augusta
is
already
a
dike.
that's
taken
care
of,
and
the
swamp
land
down
there
where
the
river
floods
out
has
no
sufficient
value
to
justify
this
kind
of
expenditure
by
the
federal
government.
and,
then,
we
call
attention
in
our
brief
to
the
fact
that
there's
very
little
practical
navigation
to
augusta.
in
1954,
there's
only
24,000
tons.
that's
about
1
ton
round
trip
for
a
month.
it
had
dropped
from
a
150,000
tons
in
1937.
now,
with
reference
to
the
law,
as
i
say,
we
don't
dispute
the
federal
power
to
build,
construct,
and
to
operate.
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
government
is
taking
private
property.
government
concedes
that
our
highlands
are
being
taken,
and
they
wish
to
subtract
from
the
value
of
those
highlands
the
potential
use
with
the
stream
for
water
power
purposes,
what
we
call
our
proximity
value.
now,
having
found
this
potential
use,
the
courts
below
applied
the
law,
which
you
declared
in
the
olson
case
and
you
repeated
in
the
powelson
case,
that
this
potential
use,
if
it
affected
market
value,
must
be
considered
as
an
element
of
value.
in
olson,
you
said
the
facts
didn't
justify
that
application.
and,
in
powelson,
you
reversed
and
sent
it
back
because
they
had
capitalized
earnings
and
they
had
valued
north
carolina's
right
of
eminent
domain
which
is
not
private
property.
in
the
grand
dam
case,
which
was
between
a
licensee
of
the
federal
power
commission,
not
the
united
states,
you
reserved
this
question
in
grand
dam,
this
potential
was
bagged
by
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
you
affirmed
here,
saying
that
it
was
a
value
to
be
considered.
and,
we
submit
that
that
case,
in
principle,
applies
here
because
it's
not
the
value
to
be
taken.
i
agree
with
mr.
spritzer
on
that.
it's
what
the
owner
losses.and,
if
the
owner
lost
private
property
in
grand
dam
to
the
state
authority,
which
was
the
condemning
body
there,
then
it
has
lost
property
of
the
same
character
here
to
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
condemning
authority
must
be
either
the
united
states
or
state
or
some
corporation
to
whom
one
of
the
two
has
delegated
the
power.
now,
there
is
--
there
is
a
line
of
cases
involving
the
navigation
servitude
which
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
a
moment.
probably,
that
came
out
of
english
common
law,
the
fact
that
the
public
had
a
right
to
use
the
stream
for
passage
but,
in
any
event,
it
has
become
a
part
of
the
federal
law
under
the
commerce
clause
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states
when
--
when
the
constitution
was
adopted.
this
protection
of
this
public
easement
for
navigation
became
a
part
of
the
protection
for
the
federal
government
on
navigable
streams,
and
you
have
applied
it.
you
applied
it
in
chandler-dunbar,
to
say
that
the
chandler-dunbar
company
had
no
right
to
build
these
wing
dams
in
this
important
st.
mary's
river
draining
lake
superior
and
had
no
right
to
the
lower
water.
you
applied
it
in
the
willow
run
case
to
say
that
there
was
no
compensation
where
no
fast
land
was
taken
because
the
upper
dam
would
have
lost
something
of
its
head.
you
applied
it
in
the
chicago
railroad
case,
dealing
with
one
of
the
mississippi
river
navigation
dams,
to
say
that,
as
to
that
part
of
the
railroad
property
below
high
water
mark,
there
could
be
no
compensation.
as
to
that
above,
there
could
be
compensation.
and,
you
cited
it
again
in
the
kansas
city
case.
now,
those
cases
all
involved
real
navigation
and
all
involved
property
rights
below
high
water
mark.
and,
we
say
this
navigation
servitude
in
the
sense
that
it
permits
the
united
states
to
use
property
without
compensation
is
limited
by
two
factors.
first,
there
must
be
--
it's
limited
to
the
bed
of
the
stream.
you
said
that
in
the
kansas
city
case,
in
the
chicago
case,
in
the
--
and,
i
believe,
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
willow
run
is
kansas
city
two,
that
its
limited
to
the
land
below
high
water
mark.
now,
we
are
not
here
arguing
about
the
1400
acres
which
twin
city
owns
in
the
bed
of
the
savannah
river.
the
government
didn't
describe
that
in
its
condemnation
papers.
we
haven't
made
any
claim
about
it.
that
is
the
kind
of
land
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
take
provided
this
were
a
navigation
easement.
and
then,
the
second
thing
is
that
there
must
be
clear
showing
of
congressional
intent
to
take
without
compensation.
you
said
it
most
recently
in
niagara
mohawk.
now,
let's
go
back
to
that
bed
of
the
stream
and
take
this
chandler-dunbar
case
which
the
government
principally
relies
on
in
that
case.
there
were
three
issues
in
chandler-dunbar.
first,
whether
chandler-dunbar
was
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
water
itself
and
for
its
structures,
its
wing
dams
which
it
had
put
below
high
water
mark,
and
the
court
said
no.
then,
the
question
was
whether
chandler-dunbar
was
entitled
to
an
industrial
value
for
a
piece
of
upland
of
that
potential
which
chandler-dunbar
said,
“we
are
going
to
use
with
the
water
which
we
generate,
the
surplus
water
we
generate
at
this
dam.”
the
court
said,
“no,
you're
not
going
to
have
any
surplus
water
with
which
to
make
power
and,
therefore,
this
upland
does
not
have
any
use
in
connection
with
non-existing
power.”
the
important
thing
in
chandler-dunbar,
as
the
fourth
circuit
emphasized,
was
what
they
said
about
the
lock
and
dam.
chandler-dunbar
had
a
piece
of
uplands
which
the
lower
court
found
was
useful
for
lock
and
dam
purposes.
and,
at
that
use
was
so
probable
as
to
affect
its
market
value
and
they
made
an
award
for
that
use
for
lock
and
dam
purposes,
and
this
court
affirmed.
now,
what
difference
--
what
legal
difference
is
there
between
the
potential
use
of
uplands
for
lock
and
dam
purposes,
which
require
use
with
the
water
of
the
stream,
and
the
use
of
uplands
for
hydroelectric
purposes.
we
submit
to
you
that
the
lock
and
dam
use
is
closer
to
the
navigation
servitude
than
is
the
water
power
use.
the
counsel's
interpretation
of
federal
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
--
excuse
me.
now,
the
federal
power
act,
it
seems
to
me,
would
interpret
that
statute
as
having
taken
property
without
due
process
and
taken
property
without
just
compensation
by
the
passage
of
the
act
itself
because,
as
we
understand
their
argument,
because
we
haven't
got
a
federal
power
commission
license
and
because
nobody
can
get
it
except
by
permission
of
a
federal
agency,
the
property
has
lost
all
of
its
value.
you
rejected
that
argument
in
the
grand
dam
case
and
you
said
there,
as
you
did
in
first
iowa,
that
the
federal
power
act
has
conferred
great
benefits
on
licensees.
it's
true,
it
has
attached
conditions
but
it
has
conferred
benefits.
we
also
find
support,
we
think,
in
the
monongahela
case
in
which
the
government
--
united
states
condemned
the
navigation
project
on
a
navigable
river,
authorized
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and,
this
court
approved
an
award
which
included
the
franchise
for
the
navigation
tool.
now,
with
reference
to
the
second
phase
of
this
case
dealing
with
whether
the
congress
has,
in
the
flood
control
act
of
1944,
attempted
to
exercise
this
navigation
servitude.
we
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
must
be
clear
authorization
because
you're
getting
into
the
feel
of
confiscation
here.
you're
getting
into
the
feel
of
whether
the
united
states
can
take
without
payment
and,
as
both
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuit
said,
“that's
just
not
fair.”
and,
so,
you
have
required
clear
authorization.
that
is
your
language
in
niagara
mohawk.
in
kansas
city,
you
narrowly
construed
that
easement
to
require
the
government
to
pay
for
the
subsoil,
the
interference
with
the
subsoil
drainage,
even
though
the
improvement
of
the
government
did
not
go
beyond
high
water
mark.
you
didn't
put
any
water
back
on
this
man's
land.
you
just
prevented
his
water
draining
out.
the
gerlach
case
is
an
example
of
where,
even
though
they
were
general
references
to
navigation
and
flood
control
and,
unquestionably,
in
that
big
central
valley
project
out
there,
there
are
many
legitimate
navigation
and
flood
control
benefits.
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
whether
these
owners
of
the
bed
of
the
stream
below
the
friant
dam,
who
depended
for
their
value
on
these
floods,
whether
they
were
entitled
to
compensation.
you
found
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
take
from
them
that
bed
of
the
stream
even
though
it
had
the
power
to
do
it
because
it
was
below
a
high
water
mark.
and,
you
treated
it
under
the
reclamation
act
rather
than
under
the
other
statutes.
i
may
incidentally
say
that
a
part
of
the
authorization
for
that
central
valley
project
is
contained
in
the
same
flood
control
act
of
1944,
under
which,
clark
hill
was
built.
of
course,
it's
a
continuing
process
and
it's
authorized
many
other
places
also.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
but
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
well,
the
savannah
river
electric
was
willing
to
try.
they
applied,
actually,
at
that
time
for
a
license
and
carried
it
to
the
fourth
circuit
to
attempt
to
get
a
license
to
build
their
concerns.
so,
we
actually
had
two
purchases.
of
course,
they
were
mutually
exclusive.
savannah
river
electric,
actually,
was
going
to
build
the
identical
project
which
the
government
did
build.
under
slight
or
different
circumstances,
i
believe
savannah
river
electric,
rather
than
the
government,
would
have
built
it,
but
it
turned
out
that
they
went
in
first,
just
like
the
roanoke
rapids
case.
united
states
built
buggs
island
and
then
the
private
company
came
along
and
obtained
a
license
to
build
one
of
the
other
projects
on
the
roanoke
river.
but,
they
were
two
better
as
action
trying
to
get
out
from.
of
course,
we
couldn't
sell
to
both
of
them
because
they
were
mutually
exclusive
and,
had
the
license
been
granted
to
savannah
river
electric,
they,
rather
than
united
states,
would
have
been
the
purchaser
or
the
condemnor
had
we
not
been
able
to
agree
here.
now,
there's
another
phase
of
this
case.
in
all
of
the
navigation
servitude
cases
where
the
government
has
taken
without
a
compensation,
and
i'm
not
dealing
now
with
the
damage
cases,
there
has
been
a
navigation
improvement
in
the
very
stretch
of
the
road
which
is
being
taken.
it's
not
a
headwater
proposition.
in
the
gerlach
case,
in
stating
the
government's
argument,
mr.
justice
jackson,
i
believe
wrote
that
opinion,
pointed
to
it
in
this
fashion.
the
government
relies
on
the
rule
that
it
does
not
have
to
compensate
for
destruction
of
riparian
interest
over
which,
at
the
point
of
conflict,
it
has
a
superior
navigation
easement
to
exercise
what
it
gauge
as
the
damage.
now,
the
government
claims
here
that
they
can
take
our
property
uptown
for
a
navigation
benefit
found
below
augusta
25
miles
downstream.
in
none
of
the
taking
cases,
under
the
navigation
easement,
has
there
been
taking
property
at
one
side
on
the
river
for
a
navigation
benefit
to
a
dam.
logically,
that
means
that
they
can
take
all
of
the
lands
up
here,
100
miles
away,
for
navigation
help
below
augusta.
now,
i
realize
that,
in
your
--
in
the
damage
cases,
that
you
have
said
that
there
may
block
navigation
at
one
point
to
help
another,
south
carolina
against
georgia,
the
scranton
case,
the
gibson
case
in
the
ohio
river
and,
more
recent,
commodore
park
cases.
but,
damage
by
the
united
states
is
not
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
and,
in
the
absence
of
statute,
the
government
can
do
pretty
much
as
they
please
with
reference
to
it.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
absence
of
a
license.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
the
defense
in
the
district
court.
now,
the
government
came
in
with
a
witness,
an
engineer
from
the
federal
power
commission,
who
testified
that,
after
1926
and
1928,
the
federal
power
commission
thought
that
a
dam
at
this
point
was
a
better
development
of
the
entire
river
system
than
a
dam
at
price's
island
above
the
mouth
of
little
river
where
we
proposed
to
put
it.
and,
they
made
the
point
that,
since
our
identical
project
could
not
be
licensed,
wouldn't
be
licensable
because,
under
the
federal
power
commission
criteria,
it
was
not
the
best
development
of
the
river.
we
had
lost
all
power
value.
the
courts
rejected
that
argument
and,
instead,
merely
treated
the
government's
evidence,
as
it
should
be
treated,
as
saying
that
our
property
were
not
only
was
economically
feasible
for
development
itself,
but
was
even
more
of
value
as
a
part
of
a
larger
interest
below,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
correct,
nor
do
we
think
there's
anything
in
the
argument
that
nobody
but
the
government
can
build
because
the
federal
power
commission
has
the
right
to
license
these
projects.
your
grand
dam
decision
said
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
argument
can
be
made
that
there
is
more
navigation
benefit
to
the
united
states
through
the
application
of
the
federal
power
act
in
some
of
these
cases
than
results
to
united
states
from
this
act.
now,
take
the
ford
case,
for
instance,
up
on
the
hudson
river.
i
believe
the
decision
here
is
1930.
mr.
justice
stone's
case
wrote
the
opinion.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
navigation
dam
on
the
hudson
with
a
lock
in
it,
a
real
part
of
the
navigation
easement.
forged
out
a
license
to
put
a
powerhouse
on
that
dam
and
to
rent
the
water
from
the
government
and
permission
to
put
flashboards
to
raise
the
level,
as
a
result
of
which,
he
raised
the
level
on
the
tailrace
of
a
dam
on
the
mohawk
which
run
into
the
hudson
just
above
that.
and,
new
york
court
enjoined
his
maintaining
those
flashboards
and
you
affirmed
him.
now,
in
that
case,
those
flashboards
action
would
have
more
navigation
benefit
than
the
4%
of
this
project
which
is
devoted
to
flood
control
and
to
navigation.
you
have
--
you
have
in
the
--
in
the
niagara
mohawk
decision,
you
have
permitted
water
rights,
totally
unconnected
with
fast
land,
to
be
evaluated
in
the
federal
power
processes
which
means,
ultimately,
higher
price
to
the
government
if
they
exercised
the
option
because
you
found
in
that
case
that
the
federal
government
had
not
--
congress
had
not
intended
to
exercise
the
servitude.
now,
we
submit
that,
in
these
cases,
we
go
right
back
to
fundamental
eminent
domain
law.
we
have
concurrent
findings
of
commissioners,
two
district
courts,
and
six
court
of
appeal
judges,
all
unanimous
that
this
property
had
such
a
potential
for
water
power
purposes,
because
of
its
proximity
to
the
river,
that
it
had
affected
market
value,
that
this
hydroelectric
use
was
the
best
use
possible
for
the
property,
and
we
approached
it
entirely
from
the
market
value
view
which
the
courts
have
found
was
the
price
which
a
willing
buyer
would
have
paid
a
willing
seller
for
this
very
property.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
we
offered
three
top
flight
engineers
who
took
the
history
of
the
project,
the
geological
and
the
geographical
features
with
the
engineering
plans
which
twin
city
had
maintained
over
the
years.
they
made
a
study
of
those
plans,
involved
what
it
would
cost
to
do
it,
compared
that
with
other
sources
of
power,
made
computations
of
that
kind,
and
came
up
with
what,
in
their
opinion,
the
buyer
would
pay
for,
having
in
mind
that
he
would
--
he
would
have
to
have
a
profit,
too.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
they
were,
and
the
government
witnesses
so
conceded,
yes.
they
--
we
had
mr.
krieger
who
is
now
there
to
--
of
buffalo
who,
perhaps,
was
the
leading
hydroelectric
engineer
who
had
vast
experience
in
advising
bankers
about
loans
on
hydro
projects
and
by
advising
sellers
and
buyers
a
great
deal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
testified
in
your
grand
dam
case,
which
came
here
on
the
same
basis.
we
had
mr.
courtney
of
philadelphia
of
the
just
--
the
court
affirmed
that,
also,
it
had
vast
experience
in
that
pennsylvania
area
with
reference
to
this
water
power
matter.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
yes,
sir.
we
had
land
--
we
had
land
value
as
to
testify
as
to
timber
value
and
things
of
that
kind.
but,
of
course,
they
couldn't
testify
on
hydraulic
matters.
we
also
offered
in
evidence
a
comparison
with
the
land
cost
of
the
sancti
projects,
the
11
projects
developed
on
the
sancti.
our
engineers
compared
that
on
a
land
cost
per
installed
kilowatt
on
the
basis
of
land
cost
per
kilowatt-hours
of
generation
and
on
the
basis
of
percentage
of
land
cost
to
the
total
cost,
and
the
award
to
us
for
the
land
value
is
less
substantial
than
in
the
sancti
system.
we
used
the
federal
power
commission's
published
report
which
shows
that,
on
a
project
of
this
size,
the
average
cost
per
kilowatt
is
--
per
land
is
$28.
i
think
it
works
out
between
$28
and
$30
as
what
the
award
for
us
is
there.
we
were
not
able
to
get
into
evidence
the
question
of
our
negotiations
values
and
the
government
objected
and
we
were
afraid
to
press
as
to
whether
unaccepted
offers
were
proper.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
twin
city
is
the
one
that
appealed
from
the
amount
from
the
commissions
to
the
district
court.
the
government
hasn't
questioned
the
amount.
as
i
say,
it's
one
half
of
the
value
you
affirmed
in
the
grand
dam
case
on
a
--
on
an
acreage
basis.
they
got
800,000
for
1400
acres.
we
got
a
million
two
---
1,000,250
for
4700
acres,
4500
acres,
about
$260
an
acre
or
something
of
that
kind.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
well,
if
that
were
true,
the
passage
of
the
federal
power
act
would
eliminate
all
of
this
fact,
and
you
said
it
didn't
in
the
grand
dam
case.
i
think
i've
got
that
quoted
in
my
brief
on
page
27.
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
power
act
cannot
be
said
to
have,
so
far,
affected
the
use
of
this
land
for
power
site
as
to
destroy
or
otherwise
render
valueless
the
owner's
right
to
use
it
for
that
purpose.
that
act
merely
has
attached
conditions
to
the
use
of
the
land
for
power
site.
the
act
seeks
to
encourage
rather
than
to
prohibit
the
development
of
power
sites.
that's
on
page
27
of
our
brief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
federal
power
commission
license
in
1928
for
this
project
at
clark
hill.
my
recollection
is
that
it
was,
perhaps,
a
90-foot
project
instead
of
a
130-foot
project,
but
it
was
substantially
at
the
same
dam
site
and
would
have
taken
the
twin
city
lands.
and,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
army
engineers
had
started,
i
believe,
in
1947,
it
would
have
been
licensed
again
to
the
savannah
river,
which
was
a
subsidiary
and
affiliate
of
georgia
power
company,
a
ready
user.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
well,
this
is
the
way
that
they
arrived
at
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
took
the
potential
navigation
below
augusta
and
figured
out
what
it
was
worth
in
dollars.
then,
they
estimated
that
if
clark
hill
operated
on
a
58%
load
factor
and
stevens
creek,
which
is
below
it,
operated
on
a
100%
load
fact
so
as
to
level
out
the
river,
it
would
result
in
certain
losses
of
power
for
stevens
creek
to
operate
on
this
high
load
factor.
they
capitalized
that
saving.
they
--
they
subtracted
from
the
navigation
benefit
this
loss
of
power
on
stevens
creek,
and
then
they
capitalized
the
difference
and
arrived
at
a
million-and-three,
as
i
recall.
that's
the
way
they
did.
now,
when
the
army
engineer
testified
before
congress
in
a
footnote
which
we
have
in
the
brief,
he
went
at
it
a
different
way.he
went
at
it
from
the
viewpoint
of
benefits
and
he
took
these
same
benefits
and
figured
the
power
benefit
at
eight
million,
or
whatever
it
was,
and
he
worked
that
it
happened
to
come
out
about
the
same
percentage
as
capital
cost,
and
so
forth.
but,
i
don't
think
we
have
minimized
navigation.
and,
unquestionably,
the
stream
flow
could
be
further
improved
if
there's
any
occasion
to
do
it,
but
actual
navigation
has
dropped
from
a
150,000
tons
to
24,000
tons
over
about
an
eight-year
period.
and,
the
24,000
tons
is
after
clark
hill
went
into
operation.
the
first
unit
went
in,
in
the
late
1952
and
the
last
unit
in
1954.
as
i
recall
it,
they
have
280,000
kilowatts
and
740,000
units.
we
are
not
saying
that
there
isn't
an
incidental
benefit
to
navigation.
we
are
not
saying
that
it
isn't
an
incidental
benefit
to
flood
control.
the
army
didn't
think
it
was
worthwhile
to
put
any
extra
storage
and
buy
him
a
landfill,
but
any,
with
--
rather
reporting
what
it
is
today,
a
dam
of
that
size
would
certainly
be
let
down
in
advance
of
heavy
rains
and
would
catch
some
of
the
flood
control
waters.
but,
we
are
saying
that
it
isn't
the
clear
authorization,
as
you
said
in
niagara
mohawk
was
necessary,
to
permit
the
federal
government
to
take
property
without
compensation.
now,
we
agree
that
when
you
are
finding
a
federal
authorization
--
a
federal
power
to
do
this
or
that,
you
must
engage
in
all
the
presumptions
of
validity
but
out
of
deference
to
the
congress.
but,
here,
what
we
are
doing
is
we're
talking
about
confiscation.
should
this
value
be
there?
unquestionably,
the
value
is
here.
now,
these
people
weren't
just
a
dog
in
the
manger.
they
had
been
working
on
this.
they'd
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
on
the
project
and
a
private
company,
as
judge
potter
said
in
the
fourth
circuit,
certainly
would
have
had
to
pay
this
kind
of
a
value.
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
an
excessive
value.
it
represents,
out
of
the
$77
million,
only
less
than
2%
of
the
cost
of
the
entire
project.
and,
yet,
on
our
property
was
45%
of
the
falling
river.
this
was
the
heart,
the
waste
of
the
project.
we
also
say
that,
in
connection
with
the
consideration
of
the
navigation
thing,
the
emphasis
throughout
this
engineer's
report,
we
must
operate
clark
hill
at
25%
load
factor.
your
remark
in
powelson
that
that's
the
way
the
peaking
energy
is
used
in
the
southeast.
it
takes
the
top
of
the
peak
and
saves
so
much
generation
capacity.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
yes.
we
think
that
we
are
getting
fast
land
here
and
we're
entitled
to
the
full
market
value
of
fast
land.
it
happens
to
be
near
the
river,
just
like
the
washington
hotel
is
near
pennsylvania
avenue,
which
the
owners
of
that
hotel
do
not
own
or
control.
now,
proximity
is
the
crux
of
most
value.
i
agree
that
mineral
rights
or
fertility
occasion,
but
its
proximity
to
the
stream
and
our
highlands
have.
they
have
taken
our
riverbed
and
they
haven't
even
described
it
in
the
condemnation
proceedings
and
we've
made
no
claims
of
it.
we
don't
think
they
ought
to
take
the
great
majority
of
our
value
about
highlands.
mr.
david
w.
robinson
the
commissioners
found
$37
in
south
carolina
and
$31
in
georgia.
the
district
court
did
not
pass
on
it
because
they
said
you
only
have
one
value,
and
this
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
they
give
--
they
gave
it
the
value
that
you
have
here,
the
million
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson
$265
per
acre
is
what
this
works
out.
they
made
a
lump
sum
valuation
than
pro
rating.
there
were
about
six
condemnation
proceedings,
three
in
georgia
and
three
in
south
carolina.
