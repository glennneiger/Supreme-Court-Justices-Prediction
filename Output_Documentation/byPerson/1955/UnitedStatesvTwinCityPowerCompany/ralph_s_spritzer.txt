mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
this
case
involves
an
issue
of
just
compensation
arising
out
of
eminent
domain
proceedings
which
were
instituted
by
the
united
states
in
1947
in
the
western
district
of
south
carolina.
the
taking
was
made
necessary
by
the
building
of
a
dam
on
the
savannah
river,
which
forms
the
border
between
south
carolina
and
georgia,
at
a
location
known
as
clark's
--
clark
hill.
the
clark
hill
dam
is
a
vital
part
of
a
comprehensive
plan
which
is
pictured
on
this
map
which
has
been
reproduced
by
the
engineers
from
the
engineers'
studies.
the
clark
hill
dam
is
a
central
part
of
the
savannah
river
basin
project
and
it's
located
at
this
point
here,
right
at
the
tip
of
this
brown
area
which
represent
the
reservoir
basin.
the
project
has
as
its
declared
purposes
flood
control,
navigation
improvement,
and
hydroelectric
development.
the
condemned
lands,
whose
value
is
in
question
in
this
proceeding,
are
located
some
miles
upstream
from
the
government's
dam
at
clark
hill.
they
have
been
flooded
as
a
result
of
the
backing
up
of
the
river
by
the
dam
or,
otherwise
stated,
they
are
now
part
of
the
reservoir
basin.
now,
for
this
taking
of
its
fast
lands
adjacent
to
the
river,
respondent
is,
of
course,
entitled
to
compensation.
respondent,
however,
has
been
awarded
what
we
believe
to
be
a
special
increment
of
value
to
which
it
is
not
entitled.
whether
we
are
right
in
that
view
is
--
is
the
issue
here.the
increment
has
been
for
the
so-called
water
power
value
or
dam
site
value
of
the
lands
condemned.
i
might
say
that
the
award
for
water
power
value
so-called
was
approximately
eight
times
what
the
condemnee
would
have
received
under
special
findings
which
were
made
by
the
commissioners
if
it
had
been
concluded
that
such
element
was
to
be
excluded
from
consideration.
i'd
like
to
state
very
briefly,
in
summary
form,
without
elaborating
any
of
the
propositions
of
this
point
and
without
discussing
any
of
the
cases
which
we
think
bear
upon
the
propositions,
the
government's
legal
position.
the
clark
hill
project,
we
say,
was
undertaken
in
the
exercise
of
the
paramount
authority
of
the
united
states
over
navigable
waters.
the
respondent's
land,
it
is
true,
was
suitable
for
the
possible
development
of
a
power
project,
though
the
government
had,
in
fact,
built
its
dam
at
a
different
location
which
is
mutually
exclusive.
we
say,
however,
that
respondent
had
no
legal,
no
established,
no
vested
right
to
throw
a
dam
across
a
navigable
stream
of
the
united
states.
indeed,
such
action
on
its
part,
in
the
absence
of
expressed
federal
authorization,
in
the
form
of
a
likeness,
would
have
been
in
direct
violation
of
a
statute
which
has
penal
sanctions.
therefore,
we
say,
respondent
cannot
assert
as
against
the
united
states
exercising
its
dominant
reserved
powers.
a
claim
of
land
value
which
is
predicated
upon
a
use
of
the
waters
which
it
is
not
entitled
to
make.
here,
the
united
states,
far
from
delegating
its
prerogative,
as
it
might
have
done,
has
chosen
directly
to
exercise
them
by
a
public
project.
now,
before
attempting
to
go
further
with
--
with
the
argument,
i
am
--
would
like
to
go
back
to
treat
some
of
the
geography
and
history,
the
history
of
the
proceedings
and
some
of
the
physical
facts.
we
do
so
in
some
little
detail
because
respondent,
in
its
brief,
has
made
a
major
attack
upon
the
determination
by
congress
that
this
was
a
navigation
project.
they
argue
that
the
court
should
not
so
considerate.
and,
consequently,
i
think,
it's
necessary
to
go
into
some
of
the
background
which
led
to
congressional
authorization
and
out
of
which
these
proceedings
arose.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
claim
that
the
court
should
not
regard
this
as
being
within
the
navigation
power.
they
say
that
this
is
not,
in
fact,
a
navigation
improvement.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
oddly
enough,
the
concession
is
made
that
the
government
could
build
the
project.
on
the
other
hand
much
stress
is
laid
upon
the
contention
that
it's
not
a
navigation
project.
in
respondent's
view,
that,
apparently,
might
lead
to
a
different
measure
of
compensation.
at
least,
it
would
take
respondent
away
from
the
many
cases
dealing
with
the
navigation
servitude
and
its
character
upon
which
the
government
relied.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
311
--
the
311
is
correct.
it's
not
--
the
contention
is
not
so
phrased.
it's
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
the
claim
--
its
--
the
claim
is
made
that
it
is
not,
in
fact,
a
navigation
project,
and
then,
the
claim
is
further
advanced
that,
therefore,
the
rules
of
compensation
which
have
been
applied
in
cases
the
government
relies
on,
such
as
chandler-dunbar,
do
not
control
here.
that,
at
least,
i
understand
the
respondent's
position
that
i
don't
need
further
elaboration
to
respondent's
counsel.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it's
conceded
that
the
river
is
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
by
respondent.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
congress
stated
at
the
outset
of
the
act
that
it
was
only
approving
projects
which
had
substantial
navigation
and
flood
control
benefits.
then,
it
restated
in
the
particular
section
with
author
--
which
authorized
this
project
that
all
projects,
here
and
after,
listed
and
authorized
are
for
flood
control
and
other
purposes.
and,
the
act
also
defined
flood
control
as
including
canal
improvement,
which
is
partly
involved
here.but,
we
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
because
it
was
suitable
for
water
power
development.
the
commissioners
made
special
findings
as
to
the
agricultural
and
timber
value
of
the
lands
which
would
have
been
their
highest
use,
apart
from
use
in
connection
with
the
waters.
the
commissioners
also
included
in
that
valuation
a
certain
allowance
for
assembling
all
of
these
parcels.
respondent's
lands
covered
some
thousands
of
acres.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
water
power
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that
is
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
their
analysis.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we're
taking
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
fast
lands
which
border
the
river
and,
consequently,
there's
no
issue
that
respondent
is
to
be
entitled
to
their
--
to
the
full
value
of
those
fast
lands,
as
fast
lands,
the
full
value
of
those
lands
for
any
purpose,
as
we
put
it,
to
which
the
condemnee
or
buyers
from
the
condemnee
were
entitled
to
put
it.
well,
what
we
claim
is
objectionable.
it's
granting,
in
effect,
the
water
power
value
of
the
stream
by
attributing
it
to
the
lands
through
the
device
in
saying
that
the
lands
are
suitable
for
the
generation
of
water
power.
perhaps
it
might
be
well
to
--
to
go
ahead
just
a
moment
to
help
focus
the
issue
and
indicate
just
what
the
commissioners
did,
and
what
they
did
was
approved
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
assuming
that
there
were
--
that
two
persons,
the
buyer
and
the
seller,
were
both
free
to
make
the
use
and
then
one
got
condemnation
powers,
it's
certainly
so.
but,
our
whole
point
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
neither
twin
city
nor
anyone
else
was
entitled
to
throw
a
dam
across
the
river
which
was
the
necessary
preliminary
to
appropriating
the
energy
which,
in
here,
is
in
the
flow
of
the
stream.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
would
not
be.
and,
i
would
--
in
answering
justice
reed's
question,
i
have
said,
putting
aside
any
question
of
the
necessity
of
a
license
and
assuming
availability
to
both
buyer
and
seller,
in
other
words,
that
it's
not
this
case
but
a
case
on
a
non-navigable
water,
matter
of
fact,
no
licensing
problem.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
yet
had
before
it
a
case
involving
a
water
power
licensee
which
involved
this
precise
question.
indeed,
that
--
that
was
the
question
which
the
court
did
not
reach
or
have
to
reach
in
the
grand-hydro.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
--
the
--
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
the
case
which
probably
illustrates
that
is
the
old
boom
company
against
patterson
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
would
not
agree
that
that
was
true
at
all
as
to
a
--
a
throwing
a
dam
across
the
navigable
stream
where
you
have
that
situation.
i
don't
think
that
anybody
could
claim
that
he
had
a
right
to
put
up
a
project.
and,
that's
true
before,
as
well
as
after
the
power
act
because
the
government's
navigation
servitude
goes
far
back
in
congress
since
1890
has
an
affirmative
prohibition
on
placing
any
structure
in
the
stream
without
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
federal
authorization
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
secretary
of
war,
yes.
so,
my
answer
would
be
that
the
boom
company
versus
patterson
rule
would
apply
only
in
a
situation
where
the
use
was
not
prohibited
such
as,
perhaps,
a
--
an
inland
lake
or
a
non-navigable
water
in
which
the
federal
government's
prohibitions
did
not
come
into
play.
basic,
we
think,
here,
is
the
consideration,
both
from
the
standpoint
of
the
navigation
cases
and
from
the
standpoint
of
general
eminent
domain
principle,
this
is
a
use
which
was
not
available
to
the
condemnee
or
to
buyers
from
the
condemnee.
it
was
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
government's
navigation
powers.
and,
the
federal
government
may
not
be
required
when
it
properly
exercise
--
it
exercises
those
powers
to
make
special
compensation
because
it
has
chosen
to
do
that
instead
of
delegating
a
privilege
as
it
might
also
done
within
its
discretion
or
within
the
determination
and
the
wisdom
of
it
by
congress.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
--
this
entire
reservoir
now
becomes
part
of
the
federal
project,
your
honor.
and,
that's
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i'm
trying
to
address
myself
to
it.
what
--
what
troubles
me
is
that
i
don't
think
the
federal
--
the
state
government
could
build
a
highway
through
after
it
became
a
part
of
the
federal
project.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say
no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
whole
function
of
eminent
domain
proceedings
is
to
eliminate
special
value
which
the
property
may
have
to
the
taker
and
to
compensate
the
condemnee
for
what
he
has
lost.
and,
so,
the
value
of
land
in
the
area
of
this
project
became
suddenly
inflated
because
it
appears
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
federal
project.
i
take
it
that
the
courts
would
attempt
to
exclude
that
inflation
which
would
represent,
i
take
it,
speculation
that
the
necessities
of
the
government
might
result
in
a
higher
war.
i
take
it,
the
court
would
attempt
to
exclude
that
and
say,
“now,
what
is
this
worth
normally,
under
normal
conditions,
for
the
uses
to
which
--
which
are
generally
available
to
a
land
owner?”
i
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
specific
navigation
and
flood
control
purposes
which
the
project
has.i
do
attach
some
importance
to
that
because
we
find
that
the
cases
which
are
most
precisely
in
point,
as
we
view
them,
are
cases
which
involve
exercised
by
the
federal
government
of
its
navigation
powers.
the
savannah
flows
generally
through
the
whole
area
that
i
trace
with
my
stick.
the
head
waters
form
on
the
southern
slopes
of
the
blue
ridge
mountain
here,
and
they
flow
generally
in
an
easterly
direction
all
the
way
down
to
the
deep
water
in
the
port
of
savannah.
there
is
no
issue
that
the
savannah
is
a
navigable
river.
the
area
with
the
stretch
of
the
river
which
has
been
important
from
the
navigation
and
transportation
standpoint
is
the
stretch
from
augusta
down
to
savannah.
there's
been
as
much
as
130,000
tons
of
traffic
--
water
traffic
in
a
single
year
on
that
stretch
and
the
potential
is
estimated
at
something
over
a
million
tons.
it's
also
important
to
mention
that
this
area
here,
this
whole
valley
particularly
below
augusta,
has
been
highly
vulnerable
to
floods
in
the
two
decades.
between
1923
and
1942,
there
were
more
than
80
floods
in
that
valley
and
flood
peak
--
flood
peaks
occurred
in
augusta
some-130
odd
times,
as
we
are
told
by
the
district
engineer's
report
which
congress,
in
the
1944
act,
ultimately
approved
and,
on
the
basis
of
which,
it
authorized
clark
hill.
now,
the
respondent
has
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
the
government
stand
here
at
clark
hill.and,
likewise,
the
government
stand
at
park
ground,
which
was
later
authorized,
do
not
have
locks.
in
other
words,
they
don't
provide
for
the
passage
of
boats.
it's
also
true
that
certain
private
dams,
which
previously
vested
in
this
area,
indicated
in
black
here,
that
they
don't
have
locks.
the
reason
that
the
government
has
not
attempted
to
provide
for
locks
in
the
dams
upstream
of
augusta
is
that,
though
the
entire
river
is
a
navigable
river,
as
it's
conceded
by
respondent,
all
of
the
significant
traffic
takes
place
between
augusta
and
savannah.
we
think
it
was
largely
on
the
basis
of
this
emphasis
that
respondent
convinced
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and,
also,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
which
has
the
companion
case
which
arises
out
of
the
condemnation
of
the
lands
from
georgia
side
of
the
river,
that
this
was
not
a
navigation
improvement
project,
in
fact.
the
argument
is
that
the
government
that
the
points
where
the
dam
is
built
is
blocking
any
prospective
navigation.
now,
we
think
it's
clear
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and,
notably,
under
south
carolina
against
georgia,
and
united
states
against
commodore
park
that
the
government
can
block
navigation
at
one
point
on
a
navigable
river
in
order
to
improve
it
on
another.
and,
that
is
what
is
done,
here,
for
these
purposes.
prior
to
the
building
of
clark
hill
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
all
of
the
other
proposed
sites
which
are
indicated
in
this
map
in
shading
are
also
upstream.
clark
hill
is
the
furthest
downstream
and
was
the
first
dam
built.
it's
the
keystone
of
land.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right
here.
it
is
built
in
this
little
black
line,
right
at
the
tip
of
this
large
brown
area
which
represents
the
reservoir
basin.
it
is
the
furthest
dam
downstream
that
will
be
built.
the
only
other
one
which
is
actually
been
authorized
is
hartwell.
whether
or
not
appropriations
will
ever
be
made
for
the
remainder,
we
don't,
with
certainty,
know.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
think
it
does
not,
though,
we
also
think
that
we
have
both
purposes
served.
now,
apparently,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
did
make
a
difference
for
reasons
which
it
does
not
explain
in
its
opinion.
thus,
it
stated,
at
record
143,
it
is
well
settled
that
the
right
of
the
united
states
in
the
navigable
waters,
etcetera,
is
limited
to
the
control
thereof
for
purposes
of
navigation.”
just
above
that,
but
relating
to
that
same
point,
the
court
had
stated
that
it's
taking
them
here
not
for
purposes
of
navigation
but
for
the
primary
purposes
of
flood
control
and
the
development
of
water
power.
now,
as
we
understand
the
appellation
power
decision
and
the
successor
cases,
there
is
no
room
any
longer
for
the
contention
that
flood
control
is
not
comprehended
by
the
navigation
power.
indeed,
it
seems
to
us,
as
we
take
it,
it
seemed
to
the
court
in
that
case
that
keeping
a
--
a
river
within
its
banks
and
thus
avoiding
the
threat
which
would
--
which
it
would
otherwise
pose,
not
only
to
transportation
and
navigation,
but
to
life
and
property
generally,
is
one
of
the
most
compelling
reasons
for
exercising
the
navigation
power.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
so,
i
would
go
ahead
and
say,
further,
that
we
don't
think
that
it's
possible
to
say
that
the
landowner
has
the
right
to
appropriate
the
waters
for
power
purposes
when
a
necessary
preliminary
to
his
doing
so
involves
placing
a
dam
in
the
middle
of
a
navigable
river.
and,
if
we
are
right
in
that,
then
it
follows,
we
think,
on
eminent
domain
principles,
that
he
can't
claim
a
value
based
upon
such
use
because
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
think
it
can
be
framed
in
terms
of
place
value
or
some
courts
had
sometimes
said
strategic
value.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and,
i
would
say
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that's
certainly
a
fair
way
to
formulate
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
other
words,
if
this
piece
of
property,
as
in
five
miles
away
or
500
yards
away,
whatever
it
is,
the
--
the
compensation,
you
say,
would
be
different
--
would
be
grave
to
be
different
than
the
cost
of
its
strategic
position.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
most
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
most
certainly
would
qualify
it
that
way
and
i've
been
assuming
throughout
that
the
basic
consideration
here
is
the
exclusive
governmental
prerogative
to
control
the
navigable
waters.
i
agree
that
it
might
well
be
different
if
they
were
a
large
group,
all
of
whom
were
in
a
position
to
bid
for
property
for
a
particularly
use,
and
that
certainly
might
affect
its
market
value.
but,
we
would
say
that
special
value
to
the
condemnor
is
to
be
excluded
and,
indeed,
if
it
is
not
excluded,
the
whole
valuation
process
simply
becomes
a
circle
because
if
the
market
is
free
to
speculate
upon
how
much
strategic
value
it
may
have
to
the
government,
then
i
suppose,
whenever
the
government
needs
a
particular
piece
of
land,
let
us
say,
a
strategically
located
link
for
a
right
of
way,
if
the
condemnees
are
going
to
be
entitled
for
compensation
based
on
the
public
necessities
of
the
situation,
that
piece
of
land
might
go
up
a
hundred
fold.
now,
if
the
court's
function
is
not
to
exclude
that,
but
merely
to
determine
how
the
market
or
how
the
speculators
have
estimated
the
necessities
of
the
public,
then,
i
suggest
that
the
valuation
process
would
simply
become
a
matter
of
the
courts
attempting
to
find
out
how
much
the
speculators
thought
the
court
would
grant.
and,
i
think
that
the
--
when
this
court
says
that
market
value
is
to
govern,
that
must
necessarily
exclude
the
special
needs
of
the
public
represented
by
the
government
as
condemnor
which,
alone,
can
make
and
particularly
use
the
property
involved.
the
navigation
improvement
benefits,
and
i
have
not
yet
specifically
mentioned
what
they
are,
are
these.
the
control
of
the
river
flow,
which
is
made
possible
by
this
dam,
will
enable
the
engineers
to
increase
substantially
the
channel
back
between
augusta
and
savannah.
they
will
also
have
other
benefits,
such
as
the
reduction
of
penetration
of
salt
water.
there's
no
dispute,
as
i've
already
indicated,
that
flood
control
purposes
are
going
to
be
served
by
the
project.
much
of
the
attack
which
is
made
by
respondent
upon
the
congressional
determination,
that
this
is
serving
flood
control
and
navigation
purposes,
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
annual
benefits
from
the
production
of
hydroelectric
power
are
very
large.
respondent
says
they
completely
overshadow
the
flood
control
and
the
navigation
purposes.
the
flood
control
and
navigation
purposes
were
estimated
by
the
engineers
as
providing
benefits
of
approximately
$300,000
a
year,
and
it
is
said
that
the
power
yield
is
going
to
be
something
like
$7
million
a
year.
and,
the
suggestion,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
court
should,
therefore,
regard
the
flood
control
and
navigation
purposes
as
being
completely
unimportant
as
de
minimis
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i've
been
trying
to
emphasize
that
that
--
that
the
case
your
honor
poses
is
not
this
case.
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
that
the
result
would
be
different.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
think
it's
their
position
that
it's
stated
in
the
brief
that
the
navigation
purposes
and
the
real
one,
which
we
vigorously
dispute,
and
we
think
the
court
could
not
find
on
this
record
that
such
purpose
is
not
being
served
because
we
think
the
engineers'
studies
show
that
navigation
improvement
purposes
are
being
served
and
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
this
record
to
impugn
that
determination.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
navigation
benefits
contemplated
have
already
been
achieved
in
fact.
the
increased
river
flow,
which
will
provide
an
improved
channel,
has
been
obtained
as
a
result
of
the
construction
of
the
clark
hill
dam.
i
don't
know
if
i
answered
the
question
your
honor
had
in
mind,
but
our
purpose
in
emphasizing
the
--
the
navigation
of
the
flood
control
aspects
of
the
project
is
that
we
don't
think
that
this
court
could
possibly
find
that
congress
lacked
a
rational
basis
for
concluding
that
those
purposes
will
be
served.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
does
but,
since
the
many
decisions
in
this
area
have
all
been
cases
in
which
the
court
has
found
that
the
navigation
power
was
involved,
we've
deemed
it
important
to
set
before
the
court
facts
which
we
think
indicate
that
that
power
is
being
exercised
here.
if
these
were
a
project
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
navigation
improvement
but
was,
perhaps,
justifiable
on
--
on
some
other
constitutional
basis,
not
the
commerce
clause
but
perhaps
some
general
emanation
from
the
general
welfare
clause,
i
don't
know
that
the
result
would
necessarily
be
different.
but,
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
case
in
a
different
area
from
those
of
the
precedence
upon
which
we
rely,
and
we
prefer
to
rely
upon,
what
seems
to
us,
an
established
course
of
decision
rather
than
to
ask
the
court
to
go
on
relatively
unchartered
waters
perhaps.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
we
--
we
can
see
that
there
might
be
many
more
problems
when
--
if
one
were
to
consider
projects
under
the
general
welfare
of
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
but
that
location
value
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
of
course,
strategic
value
must
be
in
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
we
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
the
navigation
cases
are
a
very
special
class
of
cases
because,
nature
having
fixed
the
--
the
streams
in
one
place,
everyone
is,
in
effect,
on
notice
as
--
as
this
court
has
stated
it
that
his
use,
if
he's
a
riparian
owner
of
the
waters,
and
his
right
of
access
to
the
waters
might
become
valueless
if
the
government,
exercising
its
navigation
powers,
does
something
which
--
which
blocks
them
all.
most
of
the
history,
in
the
--
in
the
19th
century,
of
cases
involving
the
relationship
of
the
navigation
servitude
to
riparian
owners
have
been
cases
in
which
the
government
effectuated
some
improvement
on
the
river,
which
impaired
access
of
the
riparian
owner
to
the
stream.
scranton
against
wheeler
is
--
is
typical
of
those
cases.
the
government
built
a
pier
on
the
river.
that
pier
would
cut
off
completely
the
riparian
owner's
frontage
on
the
stream
and
it
cost
him
serious
economic
law.
he
brought
suit
against
the
government.
the
case
ultimately
came
to
this
court.
and,
justice
harlan,
speaking
for
the
court
in
that
case,
said
that
the
riparian
owner's
right
of
access
was
always
subject
to
the
contingency
that
it
might
become
valueless
by
--
as
a
result
of
the
government
project
undertaken
in
the
exercise
of
the
navigation
powers.
he
went
on
to
state
that
the
authority
of
congress
to
exercise
these
powers
was
not
to
be
crippled,
which
is
the
language
of
the
court's
opinion,
by
compelling
some
special
compensation
because
expectant
fees
had
been
defeated
or
established
uses
by
the
riparian
owner
had
been
terminated.
the
case,
of
course,
upon
which
we
think
is
most
closely
in
point
and
even
more
closely
than
the
cases
involving
impairment
or
loss
of
access
to
a
stream
is
chandler-dunbar
because
of
the
peculiar
similarity
of
the
--
of
the
facts
in
--
in
that
case
and
this.
chandler-dunbar
was,
of
course,
a
company
which,
at
one
time,
had
a
license
to
put
works
in
the
stream.
it
had
operated
under
that
license
that
it
put
works
in
the
stream.
it
had
drawn
power
from
it.
the
license,
however,
was
revocable
by
congress.
congress
passed
a
statute
which
revocated
chandler-dunbar's
license,
and
directed
a
public
project
in
the
interest
of
improving
navigation.
now,
one
of
the
claims
which
chandler-dunbar
made
was
that
the
federal
project
was
depriving
it
of
the
flow
of
the
river,
which
it
said
was
very
valuable.
the
court
rejected
that
basic
claim,
stating
that
chandler-dunbar
had,
perhaps
under
state
law,
a
technical
title
to
the
bed
of
the
stream,
but
the
private
ownership
of
the
flow
of
the
river
was
inconceivable.
chandler-dunbar
had
another
claim
and,
that,
we
think,
has
special
pertinence
here.
it
said
that
certain
of
its
fast
plans
which
were
being
taken
for
the
government's
project
had
special
value
by
virtue
of
their
proximity
to
the
power
inherent
in
the
river.
it
said
they
had
special
value
as
factory
sites
because
of
the
nearby
power
available,
which
we
think
is
the
exact
analogue
of
the
claim
which
is
being
made
here.
and,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
what
the
court
stated
in
rejecting
that
contention.
the
court
stated,
"that
the
government
always
had
dominion
over
the
water
power
of
the
rapids
and
falls,"
which
is
the
end
of
the
quotation.
and,
went
on
to
reason
that
it
could
not
be
required
to
pay
either
directly
or
indirectly
for
what
was
already
within
the
government's
prerogatives.
and,
i
think
that
that
particular
aspect
of
the
chandler-dunbar
decision
was
again
emphasized
by
this
court
in
its
willow
river
decision.
i'd
like
to
quote
just
one
sentence
from
that
opinion
of
mr.
justice
jackson.
referring
to
the
chandler-dunbar
case,
he
said,
"it
held
that
the
shore
owner
had
no
pertinent
property
right
in
two
natural
levels
of
water
in
front
of
its
lands
or
to
the
use
of
the
natural
difference
between
as
a
head
for
power
production."
now,
that,
again,
seems
to
be
--
seems
to
us
to
be
a
precise
description
of
this
case.
if
as
sure,
twin
city
had
no
right
to
the
use
which
forms
the
basin
for
its
assertion
of
value,
that
value,
we
say,
is
not
includable
in
the
compensation
for
loss
of
property
taken
which
is
provided
by
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
was
an
impairment
of
the
operation
of
the
power
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
was
impairment
of
the
efficiency
of
willow
rivers
works
as
a
result
of
the
government's
change
in
the
level
of
the
river.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
no
fast
land.
and,
this
reference
to
chandler-dunbar
--
this
--
which
i've
been
quoting
is
their
discussion
of
what
chandler-dunbar
held,
which
appears
in
the
willow
river
opinion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'd
be
happy
to.
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
kansas
city,
the
--
the
damage
was
done
to
a
riparian
owner
on
a
non-navigable
stream.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and,
hence,
we
don't
think
it
departed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
riparian
owner
was
not
on
the
mississippi.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
was
on
a
non-navigable
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
tributary.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
the
majority
in
that
court
rested
upon
the
fact
that
the
riparian
owner
who
was,
there,
affected
didn't
have
his
property
on
a
navigable
stream,
but
it
was
on
a
non-navigable
tributary.
the
dissenters
were
of
the
view
that
that
ought
to
make
no
difference
where
the
raising
of
the
level
of
the
waters
on
the
navigable
stream
necessarily
had,
since
water
seeks
its
own
level,
the
effect
of
raising
the
waters
on
a
non-navigable
stream
as
well.
but,
i
think
the
--
the
difference
between
the
majority
and
the
dissenters
in
that
case
has
--
has
no
bearing
here
since
we
have
no
issue
that
this
is
property
adjacent
to
a
navigable
river.
we
have
no
issue
that,
being
a
navigable
river,
this
is
not
a
use
which
the
riparian
owner
could
have
made.
i
think
that's
the
basic
consideration
here.
this
is
a
navigable
river.
accordingly,
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
law
for
the
riparian
owner
of
these
fast
lands
to
put
a
stream
across
it
and
to
--
and
to
appropriate,
for
commercial
use,
the
energy
in
the
stream.
if
that
is
so,
and
we
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
denying
that,
then
we
think
it
follows
that,
since
this
was
a
use
not
available
to
the
landowner,
that
he
cannot
rest
upon
it
in
making
claim
against
the
united
states
which
has
the
power
to
control
the
navigable
streams
and
has,
here,
exercised
it.
to
do
so
is
simply
to
confer
upon
the
owner
of
the
fast
lands
value
which
inheres
in
the
flow
of
the
river.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
agree
that
that
is
a
--
a
fairway
to
state
it,
and
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
not
is
to
what
the
record
shows
because,
we
say,
the
use
which
is
the
premise
upon
which
this
claim
of
value
is
made
clearly
could
not
have
been
availed
of
by
the
respondent
in
the
absence
of
a
license.
that,
to
us,
is
crucial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
i
would
have
to
differ
there,
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
stating
our
position.
i
think
the
unavailability
of
this
use
to
the
condemnee
or
buyers
from
him
is
a
crucial
consideration.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
when
chandler-dunbar,
the
court
rejected
the
claim
of
special
value
for
this
property
by
virtue
of
its
proximity.
and,
i
think
the
whole
point
is
clarified
by
reference
to
what
boom
company
actually
held.
in
the
boom
company
case,
we
had
a
corporation
organized
under
state
law,
authorized
to
construct
boom's
which
are,
of
course,
for
the
storage
of
logs.
the
boom
company
having
this
condemnation
power
under
state
law,
preceded
to
condemn
a
shoreline
along
the
mississippi
river
which
was
owned
by
a
man
named
patterson.
the
case
was
removed
on
diversity
grounds
from
the
federal
courts,
and
it
came
up
here
on
the
question
whether
patterson
was
entitled
to
some
allowance
by
virtue
of
the
adaptability
of
his
lands
to
boom
purposes.
and,
the
court
said
yes,
and
it
said
so
on
two
grounds,
both
of
which
are
important,
i
think.
it
said,
in
the
first
place,
from
its
examination
of
state
law,
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
condemnor
was
not
the
only
one
entitled
under
the
laws
of
minnesota
to
construct
boom's.
hence,
it
said
this
land
had
value
for
boom
purposes
when
it
was
held
by
the
condemnee.
then,
the
court
said
there
was
no
obstacle,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
to
the
construction
of
a
boom
on
the
navigable
river,
so
long
as
the
boom
does
not
impede
or
interfere
with
navigation.
now,
that
--
that
illustrates
what
i
think
is
the
basic
difference
between
the
case
where
adaptability
or
place
value
may
properly
be
allowed
and
the
case
where
it
can't.
the
question
is,
as
we
see
it,
whether
the
use
is
one
which
was
available
to
the
condemnee
or
buyers
from
him,
not
necessarily
whether
he
was
using
it,
in
fact,
for
that
purpose,
but
whether
he
was
free
to
do
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it's
available
certainly
on
condition
and
we
say
that
that
condition
is
the
grant
of
a
license,
and
we
say,
further,
that
when
the
government
elects
to
reserve
the
prerogative
which
it
has
always
had
in
--
concerning
which
the
landowner
is
fully
unnoticed,
it
need
not
pay
special
compensation
for
the
denial
of
a
privilege
which
it
was
the
government's
either
to
grant
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
or
to
withhold.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
the
court
has
also
dealt
with
this
in
--
in
the
sentence
from
commodore
park,
which
i
think
is
entirely
pertinent
here.
there,
the
court
said
riparian
rights
of
access
cannot,
as
against
the
government
power
to
control
commerce,
be
bought
and
sold.
now,
this
case
involves
something
which
goes
far
beyond
mere
access.
in
the
many
cases
which
this
court
has
held
--
have
had
in
which
it
held
that
loss
or
impairment
of
access
to
the
navigable
river
is
not
compensable.
it
is
always
subject
to
the
contingency
that
it
might
become
valuable.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you
have
damage.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you
have
damage,
however,
in
those
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
nonetheless,
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
damage
is
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
compensable.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
--
the
point
i
was
endeavoring
to
make
was
that,
if
it
be
true,
as
the
court,
i
think,
has
often
said,
that
loss
of
access
is
not
compensable
because
there
is
no
right
as
against
the
government
to
access,
then,
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
necessarily
that
value
cannot
be
predicated
upon
something
which
depends
upon
far
more
than
access,
not
only
continuing
access,
but
appropriation
of
the
very
flow
of
the
river.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that,
at
page
26
of
the
record,
the
commissioners
found
that,
as
of
recent
years,
i'm
reading
about
three-fourths
in
the
page
down,
of
recent
years,
and
then
i'm
going
on
a
little,
it
is
practically
certain
that
it,
meaning
twin
city,
could
not
have
obtained
a
license
to
construct
such
project
on
the
savannah
river.
as
early
as
1939,
this
project
had
been
strongly
endorsed
by
the
federal
power
commission.
and,
it
certainly
seems
clear
as
of
that
time,
if
not,
considerably
earlier,
that
this
could
hardly
be
considered
a
licensable
project.
i
emphasize
that
because
the
keystone
of
our
position,
i
think,
is
that,
while
potential
use
affecting
value
is
to
be
considered,
that
potential
--
that
use
is
a
use
to
which
the
landowner
or
buyers
from
him
were
free
to
put
--
to
put
the
land
while
in
the
condemnee's
possession.
here,
we
say,
that
use
was
foreclosed.
here,
we
say,
additionally,
the
government
had
expressly
exercised.
i
haven't
dealt
with
the
language
of
the
1944
act
but
it
seems
to
us
completely
explicit
as
manifesting
an
intention
to
invoke
in
the
full
measure
of
the
federal
government's
navigational
powers.
mr.
robinson
has
suggested
that
the
obligation
to
compensate
twin
city,
and
we
agree
that
they're
entitled
to
compensation
for
their
property,
the
question
is
measure
of
compensation.
mr.
robinson
suggests
that
if
the
government
had
licensed
savannah
electric,
that
twin
city
would
have
been
entitled
to
much
more.
well,
if
savannah
electric
had
gotten
condemnation
powers,
i
certainly
don't
know
that
that
would
flow
and,
certainly,
grand
river
dam,
upon
which
mr.
robinson
relies
for
that
statement,
doesn't
say
that
it
is
so.
in
fact,
mr.
robinson
has
assumed
the
answer
to
the
question
which
the
court
expressly
reserved
in
grand
river
--
in
the
grand
river
case.
the
court
stated
in
that
case,
at
page
373
of
this
opinion,
that
if
either
the
united
states
or
its
licensee,
as
such,
were
seeking
to
acquire
this
land
under
the
federal
power
act,
different
considerations
might
apply.
now,
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
congress
could
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
might
the
court,
today,
may
apply.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
--
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
in
the
grand
river
dam
case,
the
majority
of
the
court,
and
the
court
was
as
evenly
divided
as
it
could
be
and
still
reach
a
decision
in
that
case,
the
majority
of
the
court
took
the
position
that
the
case
was
controlled
by
oklahoma
law
because
the
authority
had
proceeded
under
the
condemnation
powers
granted
by
oklahoma
in
the
oklahoma
courts.
and,
the
court
accepted
the
valuation
figure
reached
by
the
oklahoma
court.
the
dissenters
were
of
used
that
the
determinative
factor
became
the
institution
of
suit
in
the
state,
rather
than
the
federal
courts,
to
which
they
objected.
but,
what
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
even
the
majority
in
that
case
made
clear
that
it
was
not
undertaking
to
decide
what
rule
would
be
if
a
water-power
licensee
was
proceeding
under
the
power
act.
now,
this
case
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
dam,
yes.
yes,
it
did.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
did.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
grand
river
had
to
pay
the
value
which
was
determined
in
that
case
in
accordance
with
oklahoma
law.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
because
they
could.
the
majority
said
because
they
weren't
proceeding
as
a
licensee.
they
weren't
proceeding
as
such.
now,
that
brings
up
one
further
point,
which
i
think,
perhaps,
is
important
to
make.
whether
or
not
the
federal
power
act
should
be
construed
in
the
event
that
such
a
case
comes
to
this
court
as
requiring
certain
obligations
on
the
part
of
the
licensee,
we
would
not
--
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
necessarily
determinative
in
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
is
directly
exercising
its
on
powers
rather
than
exercising
regulatory
powers
to
license
someone
else
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
because
congress
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
thinking
of
niagara
mohawk
in
which
the
court
--
and
little
falls,
in
which
the
court
said
that
certain
state-created
rights,
water
rights,
may
be
an
appropriate
subject
of
legislative
protection
if
congress
sees
fit
to
provide
it.
and,
in
those
cases,
this
court
found
that
the
power
act
did
not
immunize
the
federal
licensees,
did
no
intend
to
immunize
them
from
the
duty
to
make
compensation
for
certain
types
of
state-created
water
rights.
now,
that
--
here,
we
don't
have
a
regulatory
statute.
we
have
the
united
states
directly
invoking
its
navigation
powers.
there
is,
finally,
this
one
final
difference
between
niagara
mohawk
and
this
situation.
in
niagara
mohawk,
there
was
an
established
use.
here,
there
was
no
right
to
throw
a
dam
across
the
stream.
