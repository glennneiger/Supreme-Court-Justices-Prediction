frankfurter
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.what's
the
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
from
there,
the
--
it
was
suggested
that
there
was
no
power
to
condemn
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
this
an
endeavor
to
--
to
ask
us
to
reconsider
the
affirmation
of
the
case,
being
that
it
is
here?
when
it
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
get
the
remedy.
i
suppose
i
will
when
i
hear
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
congress
has
provided
for
this
project
that
some
--
some
strength
is
derived
from
suggesting
that
it's
not
navigable,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
your
opening
--
your
opening
to
say
that
they
got
eight
times
the
value
of
what
the
fast
lands
would
be
as
land
abstractly
considered
because
this
was
valuable
for
navigation
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
government
generate
water
power
at
this
project?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
say
this
land
has
special
value
for
water
power
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
also
say
that
congress
didn't
condemn
--
authorize
a
condemnation
of
navigation
purposes
whereby
water
power
is
generated,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
get
your
answer
to
justice
reed's
question.
if
a
private
company
condemned
this
site,
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
reed's
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
value
that
may
be
attributed
to
this
site
for
developing
water
or
surfacing
water
power
as
a
private
concern
even
though,
at
the
time,
it
may
not
have
a
license
of
the
power
but
the
land
is
concededly
serving
for
that
purpose.
is
it
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
this
very
case.
assume
this
very
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
a
private
concern
wants
to
condemn
it
and,
as
toggling
before,
the
hope
to
buy
and
consider
power
from
this
is
an
application
for
a
license
where
the
measurement
of
the
criteria
for
waters
bear
that
if
the
condemnation
would
be
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
be
without
knowledge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
except
with
the
secretary
of
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
that
all
that
is
meant
by
that
is
the
negative
or
--
suggestion
--
the
suggestion
of
what
was
taken
from
believing
that
the
water
that
the
government
to
call
it
even.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
taken
comes
from
what
the
government
already
had,
namely,
the
use
of
the
water.
isn't
that
all
that's
meant
by
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
for
the
stream
because
that's
the
excess
that
the
law
are
going
to
give
them,
namely,
free
flow
of
the
stream.of
course
he
can
be
compensated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
is
meant
by
that
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
isn't
the
question
kind
of,
actually,
whether
it's
what
i
think,
on
your
side,
is
considered
what
you
call
“place
value,”
whether
this
parcel
of
land
is
to
be
the
territory
at
place
value?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
little
like
the
--
little
spite
house
from
another
--
different
story
in
new
york
as
place
value
because
we
think
you'd
like
to
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
it's
meant
by
that
sentence?
isn't
that
the
same
question
we've
got
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
controversy
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
our
position,
meeting
--
meeting
the
issue
so
framed
is
that
nobody
can
claim
strategic
value
in
relation
to
the
use
of
the
waters
of
a
navigable
stream
as
against
the
united
states
exercising
its
navigation
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it's
strategic.
that
is
precisely,
that
the
court
framed
it
in
terms
of
its
special
value
by
virtue
of
proximity
to
the
river.
i
also
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
show
just
how
this
valuation
was
arrived
at
to
point
to
the
process
which
the
commissioners
used,
the
method
which
i
think
informs
the
whole
nature
of
the
decision
below.
on
page
38
of
the
record,
i'd
just
like
to
refer
briefly
to
a
single
paragraph
which
i
think
illuminates
the
whole
case.
“these
expert
hydroelectric
engineers,”
the
commission
has
stated,
“first,
computed
the
annual
cost
of
producing
a
definite
amount
of
electric
power
by
water,
and
then,
computed
the
annual
cost
to
producing
the
same
amount
of
electric
power
by
steam.
then,”
as
the
paragraph
goes
on,
“the
experts
took
the
difference
and
they
capitalized
it
at
6%.
and
then,
this
capitalized
value
of
the
difference,”
the
report
goes
on
to
state,
“between
producing
power
by
steam
and
by
water
was
never
taken
as
the
true
value
of
the
hydroelectric
site,
but
was
considered
as
being
of
controlling
influence.”
in
other
words,
we
think
that
what
the
commissioners
have
done,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
to
take
the
economic
advantage
represented
by
a
hydro
plant
as
compared
to
a
steam
plant
in
that
area
and
say
that
the
landowner
is
entitled
to
a
valuation
fixed
on
the
basis
of
that
economic
advantage.
we
think,
in
practice,
this
is
to
afford
the
landowner
compensation
based
upon
the
power
potential
of
the
stream
which
the
landowner,
here,
had
no
authority
to
appropriate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
special
value
to
the
taker
is
what
is
to
be
excluded
in
the
eminent
domain
proceeding.
i
think
that
justice
holmes
so
phrased
it
in
practically
those
terms
in
the
mcgowan
case
where
the
claim
was
made
that
the
condemnees
there
ought
to
get
some
special
value
because
of
the
suitability
of
their
land
to
reservoir
purposes
when
new
york
city
was
building
the
shelton
reservoir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
just
clarify
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
clarify
that,
mr.
spritzer,
unless
the
taker
in
one
other
class
represents
the
class,
if
they
could
take
it,
or
unless
it
should
have
been
available
for
that
purpose
or
another,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
make
your
property
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
i'll
be
obliging
you
to
tell
me
with
the
same
cantor
with
which
i
ask
you
whether
you
think
i
am
over
simplifying
this
problem
in
this
instance
if
i
put
to
one
side
as
i
have
put
to
the
one
side,
i
don't
mind
to
say,
all
questions
that,
looking
behind
the
purpose
of
this
project,
that
it
can't
be
given
a
value
because
the
government
had
all
the
other
considerations.
and,
it
can't
get
down
to
the
applicability
on
the
fact,
in
this
case,
on
the
record
in
this
case,
applicability
and
its
decision
in
the
boom
case,
which
chandler-dunbar
reaffirmed
and,
more
particularly,
the
one
there
you
read
chandler-dunbar,
although
it
is
not
proper,
estimate
land
condemns
the
public
purposes
by
the
public
assessments
or
excludes
to
the
public
interest,
it
is
proper
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
property
is
so
situated
that
it
would
probably
be
desired
and
available
so
they
can
build
it.
isn't
that
the
problem,
mr.
spritzer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
dependent
on
what
the
record
shows
as
to
whether
a
--
the
latter
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
that
immaterial?
i
think
the
question
is
whether
it's
in
--
it's
so
situated
that
it
will
probably
be
desired
and
availed
of
for
such
a
purpose.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
the
landowner
himself
can't
use
it
for
a
dam
or
can't
use
it
for
the
generation
of
water
power
without
the
provision
now
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
formally
change
the
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
true
as
chandler-dunbar.
that's
why
it
is
important
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
free
doesn't
mean
that
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
get
a
license
from
the
government.
it
doesn't
exclude
that.
the
fact
that
this
--
that
this
site
which
he
availed
of,
if
permission
was
given
by
a
federal
authority
as
permission
to
constitute
this
for
this
purpose,
it
doesn't
take
it
out
as
a
category
of
availability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
suggestion
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
you
include
or
put
in
the
word
“special,”
you
already
fought
the
argument
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
you
have
no
taking
of
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
makes
it
certain
you
have
an
exercise
by
the
government
of
its
overwriting
power
to
deal
with
potentially
navigable
streams.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
taking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
taking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
taking,
not
--
not
whether
it's
compensable.
you
have
no
taking
there
for
the
purpose
of
compensation
of
your
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
that's
what
mr.
spritzer
was
really
arguing
against
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
evidence
was
produced
to
establish
market
value?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
hydraulic
engineers
the
experts
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
value
to
be
paid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
specialist
on
land
values
in
south
carolina?
