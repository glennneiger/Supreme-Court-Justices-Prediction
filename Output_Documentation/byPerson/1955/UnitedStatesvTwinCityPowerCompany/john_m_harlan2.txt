has
the
value
of
this
condemned
land
of
the
government
got
anything
to
do
with
the
measure
of
value?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
haven't
mentioned
anything
about
water
power
yet.
supposing
the
--
that
congress,
here,
had
decided
to
abandon
this
as
a
navigable
stream,
flood
control
out
and
they're
interested
solely
in
the
water
power,
the
hydroelectric
power
aspect
of
this.
would
your
case
be
different?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
supposing
it
were?
justice
john

as
i
understand
it,
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
it,
your
opponents
don't
dispute
the
right
of
the
government
to
engage
in
all
or
any
of
these
announced
purposes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
i
was
trying
to
get
at
was
whether
your
position
as
to
the
measure
of
compensation
necessarily
hinged
to
either
the
navigational
purpose
of
this
project
or
--
or
the
flood
control
aspects.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
about
their
evaluation
argument
that
anybody
purchasing
--
interested
in
purchasing
this
land
would
have
been,
of
course,
in
--
from
--
primarily
concerned
with
his
chances
of
getting
a
license
to
use
the
water
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
that
the
--
at
the
time
of
this
taking,
the
intention
of
the
federal
government
to
go
forward
with
this
project
was
such
that
no
third
party
would
have
recognized
any
possibility
of
being
able
to
use
the
water
for
that
purpose?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
assuming
your
legal
position
is
right,
there's
no
question
as
to
the
amount
of
the
valuation,
is
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
how
you
still
answer
the
government's
argument
as
to
there
not
being
a
willing
purchaser
unless
that
purchaser
had
to
get
a
license
from
the
federal
power
commission.
