the
act
--
the
act
providing
for
the
project,
did
congress
state
whether
it
was
for
navigation
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
after
the
1944
flood
control
act
which
called
for
the
development
of
this
--
of
this
project,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
state
wanted
to
put
a
highway
through
--
through
that
canyon,
one
that
is
covered
by
the
--
by
the
proposed
lake.
would
--
would
it
have
to
pay
the
reservoir
price
for
that
or
--
or
would
it
be
entitled
to
--
to
take
it
for
the
normal
value
of
the
land?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
is
--
it
isn't
until
they
purchase
it.
what
i
was
--
what
i
was
thinking,
if
before.
sometimes,
these
projects
are
--
are
authorized
by
an
act
and
nothing
is
done
for
a
great
many
years.
suppose
the
state
came
in
and
said,
“we
want
to
build
a
highway
through
that
canyon”
and
they
have
to
condemn
that
land.
would
they
have
to
pay
the
--
the
reservoir
site
value
for
that
land
or
--
after
the
government
had
preempted
the
use
of
navigable
stream
for
that
purpose
or
--
or
would
it
still
have
any
value
after
the
1944
flood
control
act
for
reservoir
purposes
for
anybody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
it
isn't
a
fair
question,
but
we're
speculating
on
some
of
these
situations
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
suppose
--
i
don't
suppose
it
would,
but
i
suppose
it
--
it
could,
unless
--
unless
the
federal
government
proceeded
to
--
to
condemn
the
land
itself.
sometimes,
you
find
that
in
the
act
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and,
maybe
--
maybe,
the
project
will
be
built
for
25
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
25
years
and,
in
the
mean
--
in
the
mean
time,
it's
the
property
of
a
private
property
and
the
state
could
be
excess
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
spritzer,
now
that
flood
--
the
control
of
floods
is
a
matter
of
national
policy,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
whether
--
whether
this
project
is
for
the
control
of
floods
or
whether
it
is
to
improve
navigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
going
to
discuss
that
kansas
city
insurance
company
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
robinson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
it
have
--
did
it
have
the
power
to
do
it
in
view
of
the
1944
act,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
--
before
you
finish,
i
--
i
wonder
if
you
ever
minimized
the
navigation
features
of
this
because
of
the
allocation
of
the
army
engineers
as
to
the
cost.
that
the
cost
must
be
attributed
to
navigation,
to
flood
control,
and
hydroelectric
power,
as
i
understand
it,
that
--
that's
only
for
that
--
those
allocations
are
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
which
feature
shall
pay
and
how
much
because
flood
control
and
navigation
are
non-reimbursable
items
and
hydroelectric
is
reimbursable,
and
they
make
hydroelectric
pay
as
much
as
the
traffic
will
bear,
namely,
as
much
as
it
can
earn
through
--
through
the
project.
but,
does
that
necessarily
minimize
the
effect
upon
navigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
spritzer.
