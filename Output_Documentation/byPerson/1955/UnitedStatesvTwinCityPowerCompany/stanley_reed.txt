justice
stanley
reed
i
take
it
that
these
were
a
private
company
that
was
condemning
this
hydroelectric
power
site
itself.
they'd
have
to
pay
this
extra
price.
justice
stanley
reed
offered
as
a
private
off-the-door
that
was
taking
to
develop
the
power
place
prior
to
the
time
that
we
had
the
federal
power
act,
they
certainly
would
have
to
pay
the
extra
price
of
the
--
the
suitability
of
the
land
that
they
acquired.
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
well,
now,
the
same
--
the
same
company
seeks
the
same
land
after
the
federal
power
act
was
passed.
then
--
then,
it
doesn't
count
anymore.
justice
stanley
reed
do
we
know
whether
there
are
going
to
be
locks
in
the
proposed
new
dam?
justice
stanley
reed
but
where
is
--
where
is
this
present
--
this
dam
is
in
litigation
here,
where
is
it
going
to
be?
justice
stanley
reed
it's
the
detriment
to
condemnees?
justice
stanley
reed
is
dunbar
the
raising
of
the
water
level
of
the
mississippi
river?
justice
stanley
reed
no,
but
he
--
justice
stanley
reed
tributary.
justice
stanley
reed
and,
because
it
is
non-navigable,
is
that
your
point?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
--
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
robinson,
even
though
you
maximize,
instead
of
minimize,
the
proportion
of
this,
it
real
use
is
to
go
to
navigation.
you
still
would
demand
the
same
amount
of
compensation
for
your
power
site,
would
you
not?
