justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
question
on
this,
just
on
your
argument
to
the
relevance.
suppose
it
was
clearly
on
them
and
the
statute
had
said,
and
you
admit,
that
the
main
purpose
of
this
word
is
for
navigation,
and
they
had
condemned
the
--
the
same
problem.would
you
say
that
the
value
that
the
government
had
to
pay
would
be
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that
argument.
what
i
want
to
find
out
was,
do
you
think
that
the
government
would
have
to
pay
less
if
it
is
clear
beyond
doubt
that
this
work
it's
doing
on
the
river
was
for
navigation
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
would
be
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
what
is
the
relevance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
what
was
the
amount
per
acre
that
it
was
figured
to
be
worth
without
the
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
value
did
they
give
it
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
the
figure?
