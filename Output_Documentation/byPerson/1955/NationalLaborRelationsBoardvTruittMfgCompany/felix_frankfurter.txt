justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
findling?
can
the
board's
power
inquire
a
showing,
supply
of
statistic
as
such
of
its
authority,
require
that
without
making
such
a
order
on
the
basis
of
a
party
and
one
of
good
faith?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
it
the
board's
position
to
put
a
--
a
claim
is
made,
they're
unable
to
pay
that
the
--
that
the
mere
failure
to
--
is
there
any
request
to
a
specific
--
didn't
they
discuss
their
economic
condition,
the
platform,
showing
of
books?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
mere
failure
to
show
its
book
as
a
matter
of
law
applying
with
that
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
reason
i
asked
my
question
is
because
of
the
jacobs
case
which
reads
very
difficult
to
enable
this
case
because
the
jacobs
case,
there's
a
theory
there,
a
number
of
circumstances.
the
company
stood
mute,
they
wouldn't
talk
about
it,
refused
to
go
on,
a
number
of
cases
of
that
--
as
i
say
was
the
thought
of
my
inquiry
is
whether
the
mere
failure
to
open
its
books,
if
i
might
say
for
myself,
i
think
it
(inaudible)
an
employer
to
doing
so,
is
of
my
point
of
view
that's
unwise
to
say,
(inaudible)
which
in
a
good
sense
a
requirement
of
having
them
open
up
their
books,
if
that's
not
--
i'm
not
the
employer.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
from
the
mere
failure
to
open
the
books,
a
conclusion
of
law
of
that
pages
in
the
books?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
else
is
there
in
this
case
except
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
gave
some,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
cause
of
argument
in
my
mind,
has
the
board's
power
to
say
really
in
order
to
make
this
negotiation,
why
so
sensible
and
effective,
you
got
to
give
me
some
more
data.
i
do
not
myself
have
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
they're
lacking
in
bad-faith
because
i
know
employers
as
if
they're
extraordinary,
almost
(inaudible)
to
get
them
opening
their
books.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
gave
some
data
here,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
repeat
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
question.
i'd
like
to
know
--
i
disagree
with
the
court
below.
i
don't
mind
saying
that.
i'm
not
sure
--
i
don't
know
if
you
agree
with
board,
disagree
with
the
board.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
board
has
power
to
require
a
further
production
of
data
without
reaching
the
conclusion,
therefore,
there's
one
of
good
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
stupidity
and
obtuseness
and
deep
feeling
on
the
subject
of
our
assumption
need
not
necessarily
prove
bad-faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
you
can
say
that,
there's
a
--
you
can
say
that
a
particular
action
or
non-action
proves
one
of
good
faith.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
it's
immaterial
whether
that's
good
or
bad-faith.
the
statute
says
good
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
those
words
mean
nothing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
reject
your
formulation.
if
i
may
say
so.
i
think
what
you
should
say
is
on
the
basis
of
such
comment
as
you
described,
the
board
may
find
one
with
good
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
good
faith
or
bad-faith,
the
state
of
mind
and
what
you're
arguing
is
that
circumstances
and
conduct
on
the
basis
of
which
the
board
may
conclude
there
was
one
on
good
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyway,
you
ought
to
agree
with
that.
the
statute
says
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
should
concede.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
the
company
was
sincere
(inaudible)
and
people
who
gave
a
little
bit
to
(inaudible)
i'm
not
taking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
a
phrase
in
the
statute
which
neither
you
nor
i
can
expunge
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
--
is
there
anything
in
this
record
apart
from
the
failure
to
--
to
produce
date
regarding
their
inability
to
pay
that
isn't
apart
from
that
before
the
board
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
exception
--
what
were
the
exceptions,
the
exceptions
to
require
this
company
to
be
--
examined
their
books
on
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
--
are
those
two
usually
exclusive
competitive
--
competitive
wages
on
inability
to
pay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
ready
to
show
competitive
positions.
they
were
rendered
--
did
you
say
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
to
be
--
does
it
tell
us
a
relevant
practice
includes
that
they
were
going
on
in
negotiations,
their
increase
in
the
economy,
it
may
at
all.
what
about
--
if
that
could
pay
more
(inaudible)
--
they
were
negotiating?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
if
we
consider
they
were
negotiating
under
the
question
of
whether
they
were
negotiating
in
good
faith,
some
confession
is
proven?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
weren't
just
stating,
just
say
no,
we
--
we're
going
to
shut
our
mouth
and
say
nothing
and
we
(inaudible)
the
fact,
these
are
our
terms,
take
it
or
leave
it,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
--
before
you
sit
down,
could
you
tell,
i
didn't
quite
get
it.
i
inferred
here
since
there
were
cases
where
although
an
employer
was
bargaining
in
good
faith
and
yet
withheld
information,
we
wanted
to
lose
hope
but
the
board
could
issue
an
order
requiring
them,
had
power
to
--
to
facilitate
the
honest
bargaining
in
such
a
case
requiring
some
--
placing
an
order
to
the
production
of
certain
data?
is
that
within
their
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
there
been
cases
like
that?
would
you
mind,
if
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
there
has
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
they
had
made
such
an
order
apart
from
as
an
independent
order,
part
of
its
authority.
now,
as
it
is
to
this
order,
are
they
finding
a
violation
of
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
happen
to
have
any
data
on
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where,
mr.
douglas,
is
--
justice

--
(inaudible)
where
the
order
of
the
board
is
on
page
--
am
i
right
about
that,
page
64
and
65
of
the
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
where
the
(inaudible)
first
were
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
(inaudible)
--
where
you
get
capitalization,
et
cetera,
and
all
that,
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
--
in
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
excuse
me,
mr.
douglas.
if
you
take
that
--
if
the
position
of
the
truitt
company
is
they
can't
afford
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can't
afford
it.
what
is
your
position
to
the
court
in
the
requirement
of
that
defense?
is
it
enough
for
you
to
say,
we
can't
afford
it
and
period,
and
give
no
basis
justifying
that
if
on
your
alternative,
either
just
say,
"we
can't
afford
it
no
more,"
and
opening
up
everything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
did
you
do
beyond
to
say,
"we
can't
afford
it
really?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
did
these
negotiations
had
--
persuasions
in
those
negotiations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
found
how
many
hours
to
do
something?
they
need
six,
seven
sessions
to
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
four?
justice
felix
frankfurter
twenty
hours
--
certainly
20
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
going
on
under
20
hours
of
talk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
characterize
it,
what
did
the
--
did
you
talk
about
the
wage
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

had
or
did
you
talk
about
other
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
figures
--
those
figures
were
put
on
the
table
as
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
ratio
--
the
ratio
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
competitive
bidding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
--
how
did
the
negotiation
break
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
before
the
--
before
this
expectant
--
the
expectant
economist
that
you
spoke
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
--
then
you
--
you'd
been
working
on
it
for
three
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
merely
--
does
this
merely
a
retrospective
construction
here,
a
retrospective
situation,
it
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
douglas,
you're
now
operating
under
a
selective
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
far?
how
long
is
that
running?
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
february,
1957.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
can't
hardly
come
into
play
right
now,
can't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
merely
--
when
this
collective
agreement
turns
out
and
he
have
new
wage
negotiations,
that
comes
into
play
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
provided
the
same
--
the
same
economic
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
mr.
douglas,
suppose
instead
of
opening
what
you
call,
"open
these
books."
you
bring
in
a
statement
and
say,
"give
some
basic
if
the
(inaudible)
namely,
evaluation
of
your
plant
in
order
to
have
for
the
year
across
the
production
the
income,
showing
that
it
had
made
only
x%
profit
and
loss
as
to
that."
could
you
do
that
without
any
congruent
consequences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
taken
--
take
a
sufficiently
long
period.
take
over
--
don't
take
the
high
or
low
month
to
think
a
sufficient
date
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
reshape
my
question
mr.
douglas.
suppose
--
when
you
say
you
--
you
can't
afford
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
make
it
--
you
can't
afford
it.
i'm
assuming
you
make
that
in
perfect
good
faith.
i'm
assuming
that
--
that
you
can
make
some
--
some
show
of
bargain,
i
mean,
maintaining
--
maintain
that
position.
and
now,
i'm
further
assuming
that
you
have
evaluated
the
company.
the
fair
way
of
showing
that
is
to
take
a
plea
(inaudible)
that
you
can
get
far
with
this,
that
it
wouldn't
delimit
one
year,
one
month.
if
you
do
that
without
any
of
these
words,
consequences,
it
may
not
satisfy
the
board,
that's
my
next
point.
you
will
then
--
the
question
then
arises
whether
they
say,
"oh,
well,
we
want
to
know
the
detail."
we
want
to
know
what
we
think
you
--
you
--
if
you
had
a
brother-in-law,
the
vice
president
from
whom
you
bought
(inaudible)
you
buy
(inaudible)
at
excessive
rates,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
you
do
--
give
them
some
basic
figures
like
that.
do
you
see
a
fair
--
a
fair
--
as
it
were
a
balance
sheet
on
the
basis
you
discussed
this
and
so
on.
the
board
might
say
or
the
examiner
might
find
that
a
plead
is
made.
the
union
might
say,
"no.
we
want
more.
we
want
--
we
want
a
breakdown.
much
more,
we
want
to
find
out
about
the
expenses
(inaudible)"
wasn't
that
supposed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
way.
that's
another
question
but
couldn't
you
--
short
of
what
he's
called,
opening
the
books,
give
some
--
you've
got
this
showing
that
when
you
say
you
can't
afford
it,
you
can't
afford
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
books
and
i
say
some
--
some
evidence
to
sustain
other
--
other
than
your
ipse
dixit
that
you
can't
afford
it.
