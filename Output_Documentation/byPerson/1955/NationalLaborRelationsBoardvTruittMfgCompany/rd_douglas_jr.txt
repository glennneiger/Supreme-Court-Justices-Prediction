mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
my
wife
the
other
day
has
said
she
worked
on
this
case
three
years
and
how
can
you
tell
about
it
in
30
minutes
and
i've
been
straining
it
a
bit
just
now.
i
want
to
say
first
of
all
that
down
at
home
when
a
court
is
called
on
to
do
something
and
most
of
the
judges
say,
"what
do
you
want
us
to
do?"
before
they
go
into
the
merits
or
whether
they
should
do
it
or
not.
and
i
want
to
take
grievous
exception
to
the
impression
that
counsel
has
endeavored
to
give
in
good
faith
this
bargaining
to
the
effect
that
the
board
after
all
didn't
really
say,
"we
had
to
open
the
books."
and
i
want
to
go
through
one
or
two
things
one
after
the
other.
in
the
first
place,
what
did
the
union
ask
for?
and
in
the
record
in
these
two
letters
on
page
2
of
the
record
and
this
started
the
whole
thing.
the
board's
--
the
union
said,
"respectfully
request
permission
to
have
a
certified
public
accountant
examine
such
books,
records,
financial
data,
et
cetera."
we
wrote
back
and
said,
"you
can't
have
that."
and
in
the
second
letter
from
the
union,
the
--
the
company
was
asked
to
submit
full
and
complete
information
and
evidence
of
its
financial
status.
it
goes
on
down
together
with
dividends
paid
in
10
years
and
the
breakdown
of
its
manufacturing
cost.
now,
that's
what
the
union
is
asking
for.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
that
is
on
page
6,
your
honor,
of
the
record.
and
in
page
two
of
our
brief,
we
have
picked
out
a
few
words,
all
of
which
appear
either
in
the
board's
brief
or
the
board's
order
or
the
union's
demand
to
show
the
tremendous
extent
of
the
board's
order.
now,
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
full
and
complete
information
as
to
its
capitalization,
its
sales,
its
cost,
its
manufacturing
cost,
its
cost
and
price
structure
upon
which
its
competitive
bidding
was
computed,
its
profits,
profit
regard
to
sales
and
cost,
dividends
and
financial
standard.
now,
then
when
we
refuse
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice,
we
have
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
we
have
selected
those
words
from
the
board's
brief
which
i
will
read
in
just
a
moment,
if
your
honor
please.
that
is
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
what
i'm
arguing,
sir,
that
if
you
send
us
back
and
say
comply
with
the
board's
order
that
it's
necessary
to
know
what
the
board
is
going
to
require.
the
board
has
simply
said,
"furnish
whatever
you
got
as
we'll
substantiate"
incidentally,
it
doesn't
say
which
might
substantiate,
which
will
substantiate,
and
we
don't
know
whether
we're
being
asked
to
prove
it
conclusively
or
not.
if
such
evidence
as
will
substantiate
it,
it
looks
like
we
either
prove
it,
or
we
are
in
bad-faith.
but
now
then,
the
complaint
was
the
next
thing.
now,
the
complaint
is
not
in
the
record
but
we
we're
charged
in
the
board's
complaint
with
having
failed
to
give
--
the
complaint
used
some
of
the
information
that
union's
letter
had
used.
now,
then
on
page
82
of
the
record,
we
find
a
very
interesting
summation
of
what
the
union
wants
and
this
was
elicited,
the
second
paragraph
of
page
82,
this
came
from
the
board's
principal
witness,
the
union
organizer.
he
says,
"now,
right
there
you
have
got
the
phraseology
there.
let
me
answer
it
this
way
and
see
if
it
gives
you
want
you
want."
he
was
answering
my
question.
"if
it
took
the
complete
records,
profits,
dividends,
manufacturing
cost
or
what
have
you,
anything
--
relating
to
the
company's
inability
to
grant
more
money
then
i
think
it
should
have
been
made
available
to
the
accountant
that
was
to
examine
the
books."
now,
if
your
honors
please,
he
is
asking
for
just
about
everything
there.
now
then,
is
the
board
asking
us
to
give
the
union,
what
the
union
wanted,
and
i
refer
to
the
board's
brief
in
this
case
before
this
court
on
page
22
and
23
and
24.
i
think
it's
important
to
read
these,
your
honors,
to
see
what
the
board
wants
in
its
brief
because
this
is
what
they're
going
to
say
to
us
if
you
send
us
back
subject
to
that.
on
page
22
of
the
board's
brief,
whether
the
business
reasons
stated
by
the
company
where
bona
fide
might
well
depend
on
what
a
financial
report
would
disclose
as
its
profit
in
regard
to
sales
and
cost,
its
capitalization,
it's
cost
and
price
structure
upon
which
this
competitive
bidding
was
computed.
now,
the
board,
not
in
its
order
but
in
its
argument
says,
"you
got
to
have
that
to
learn
the
bona
fides
of
our
position."
at
the
top
of
page
23
of
the
board's
brief,
"according
to
the
company
as
a
prerequisite
to
fulfilment
of
its
bargaining
obligation
was
required
to
grant
the
union's
request
for
full
and
complete
information
and
evidence
of
the
company's
financial
status
to
substantiate
its
claim."
and
yet
the
board
comes
here
and
says,
"we
haven't
told
him
to
open
books.
just
give
him
whatever
is
necessary
to
substantiate."
if
we
go
back
subject
to
the
board's
order,
we
will
open
the
entire
books.
finally,
on
page
24
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
that,
your
honor,
is
on
page
64
of
the
record
or
page
65,
your
honor.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
well,
i'm
reading
between
the
lines,
your
honor,
on
page
65
(b)
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
upon
request
--
i'm
reading
from
the
second
paragraph
of
page
65.
upon
request,
furnish
shopman's
local
729
and
national
association
and
so
forth
with
such
statistical
and
other
information
as
will
substantiate
the
respondent's
position
of
its
economic
inability
to
pay
the
requested
wage
increase
and
will
enable
shopman's
local
so
forth
to
discharge
its
functions
as
statutory
representative.
now,
it's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
board
just
says,
"furnish
such
statistical
and
financial
information
as
will
substantiate
your
position."
and
i'm
bringing
all
these
in
from
the
board's
brief
to
show
you
what
the
board
means.
now,
i
say
this
that
if
the
board
intended
just
a
bad
showing
of
what
would
substantiate
it,
why
do
they
argue
in
their
brief
and
use
the
magic
words,
capitalization,
price
structure,
manufacturing
cost.
indecently,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
judge
parker
asked
us
in
the
court
below,
why
are
you
afraid
to
show
this
information.
and
i
was
interested
in
your
comments
and
he
went
on
to
say,
“does
not
the
average
corporation
set
this
information
out
in
its
reports
to
stockholders.”
and
before
i
can
answer,
judge
dobie
says,
“no,
sir."
he
says,
“they
give
a
little
bit
of
profit
and
loss
and
a
statement
as
to
assets
and
liabilities,
but
the
breakdown
of
its
manufacturing
cost,"
he
said,
"that
is
a
priceless
secret
guarded
by
every
employer."
and
i
don't
know
of
any
employer
that
wants
to
tell
anybody
about
a
complete
breakdown
of
its
manufacturing
cost
and
yet
that's
what
the
union
asked
for
in
its
letters.
that's
what
they
demanded
at
the
board
hearing
and
the
breakdown
of
the
manufacturing
cost
is
part
of
the
language
used
by
the
board
in
its
brief.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
there's
third
ground
in
there.
in
the
first
place,
in
the
jacobs
case
which
is
the
principal
one
cited
by
the
board
as
i
understand
the
facts
and
i've
read
the
board
decision
and
the
board's
findings,
management
just
refused
as
to
do
anything.
they
said,
"can
we
talk
about
wages?"
"no,
we
can't
afford
it."
"what
about
paid
holidays?"
"we
can't
afford
it."
"what
about
pensions?"
now
i'm
satisfied
in
my
mind
that
that
was
a
refusal
to
bargain.
i
do
not
say
that
the
court
was
correct
in
saying,
"you
got
to
open
your
books."
but
i
do
not
think
that
management
in
--
what
is
it
--
the
language
a
sincere
desire
to
reach
an
agreement.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
well,
sir,
we
started
off
by
talking
about
competition.
we
said,
"you
got
our
wage
rates
and
we
made
a
special
point."
this
bargaining
lasted
over
a
good
many
weeks.
i
was
present
at
every
one
of
the
sessions.
we
went
to
about
six
of
our
competitors
and
asked
them
if
they
would
let
us
in
good
faith
disclose
their
comparative
records.
five
of
them
said,
"all
right,"
the
six
said,
"no,
sir.
we'll
tell
you
but
you
can't
tell
anybody."
so,
we
went
back
to
the
union
and
we
said,
"take
a
welder
in
our
shop.
a
welder
makes
a
dollar
85.
at
the
xyz
company,
a
dollar
83,
at
another
a
dollar
65."
so,
we
show
the
comparative
rates.
the
union
said,
"that's
not
enough.
we
still
believe
you
can
give
the
raise."
this
sir,
was
before
the
--
the
demand
and
incidentally,
before
they
made
any
demands
for
our
records,
they
went
on
strike.
i
think
in
good
faith
maybe
the
union
should
have
asked
for
the
records
first
but
they
pulled
an
unsuccessful
strike.
then
they
were
not
satisfied,
so
we
kept
talking
about
competition
they
said,
"oh,
you
can
get
any
contracts
you
want."
so,
we
opened
our
books
to
the
extent
of
pulling
out,
you
know
when
you
--
when
you
bid
on
a
contract
and
some
other
body
--
somebody
else
gets
it,
its
customary
at
least
in
our
region
for
the
company
awarding
the
contract
to
send
a
little
card
to
all
bidders
and
tell
who
got
it
and
what
the
price
was.
so,
we
picked
out
a
number
of
contracts,
good
contracts
we'd
love
to
have
and
we
showed
who
got
them
and
we
showed
to
the
union
we
were
underbid
by
these
companies
that
did
get
them
and
we
showed
to
the
union
that
those
were
the
companies
that
were
paying
less
labor
cost.
so,
we
said
we
think
--
now
i
told
the
union,
"i
don't
think
you've
got
any
legal
right
to
this
information
but
we
want
to
convince
you
that
we're
in
good
faith."
and
again,
we
comeback
to
that
language
in
the
globe
cotton
mills
case,
a
sincere
desire
to
persuade
the
other
fellow
to
accept
your
position.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
we
had
two
sessions,
your
honor,
about
four
hours
each
when
we
--
the
union
demanded
15
cents
at
first
then
we
came
back
with
an
offer
of
two
and
a
half.
we
had
three
sessions
and
then
we
had
a
strike,
then
we
had
one
short
session
during
the
strike,
then
when
the
strikers
came
back,
we
continued
it
and
then
they
wrote
the
letters
and
we
had
three
more
sessions
after
the
letters
and
then
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
oh,
about
–-
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
--
about
four
--
about
four
hours
a
session,
your
honor.
we
started
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
started
two
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
there
was
an
awful
a
lot
of
talk
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
well
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
talked
this
with
just
on
wage
reopening.
you
see
we
already
had
a
contract.
this
was
nothing
but
wages.
this
was
wage
reopening
clause,
we
weren't
supposed
talk
about
anything
else.
and
we
tried
the
(inaudible)
to
the
line
and
not
get
off
on
anything
else.
they
started
talking
about
the
fact
that
price
isn't
going
up
so
much.
we
said,
"yes,
our
prices
have
gone
up
too."
and
we
talked
about
these
competitors
and
they
said,
"yes.
but
you're
just
talking
about
local."
they
said,
"you
are
not
near
up
to
the
standard
in
detroit,
dayton,
up
in
there."
and
i
said,
"no,
sir.
we
are
not."
nobody
is.
nobody
in
north
carolina
pay
similar
wages
that
i
know
of
in
texas
or
anything
else
to
the
--
that
area
up
there."
so,
they
said,
"you're
in
competition
with
them."
we
said
once
in
awhile
we
bid
on
a
tennessee
valley
authority
job
against
--
theoretically
against
the
whole
country
and
we
are
in
competition
with
them
but
90%
of
our
competition
is
right
here
with
carolina
steel,
(inaudible)
virginia
bridge
and
so
forth.
now,
those
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
we
--
we
went
--
we
went
down
a
number
of
our
jobs,
a
welder,
a
riveter,
painter,
and
so
forth
and
showed
what
we
were
paying
and
what
the
others
were.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
when
it
--
break
off
except
that
we
signed
a
contract.
the
union
says,
"well,
if
we
can't
get
it,
we
can't
get
it."
of
course
the
board
has
said,
"that
it
doesn't
cut
any
ice
to
say
that
you
got
a
contract
anyway.
the
union
might
got
--
have
got
a
better
contract."
but
we
agreed
and
we
signed
the
contract
with
the
two
and
a
half
cents
and
a
short
while
later
we
offered
another
two
and
a
half.
so,
as
a
result
of
this
bargaining
the
union
got
five
cents
an
hour
raise
and
we've
had
two
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
well,
sir,
we
--
we
asked
for
a
little
stalling
time
to
see
if
we
could
effect
some
economist
and
we
found
out
we
could
not.
nevertheless,
about
three
months
after
that,
we
offered
a
two
and
a
half
cent
raise.
the
union
said,
"we
won't
say
no,
we're
not
agreeing
but
we're
not
telling
you
not
to
give
it
to
us."
so,
we
did
give
it
to
them.
but
if
--
the
court
please,
this
--
this
comes
down
to
this
basic
fact
as
to
whether
and
some
of
you
put
your
fingers
on
it
whether
per
se
we
should
by
refusing
this
be
charged
with
refusal
to
bargain.
the
question
asked,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
"can
the
board
order?"
look
at
the
books
or
if
you
want
to
cut
it
down
and
it
--
can
the
board
offer
the
furnishing
of
any
statistical
information
about
the
company.
in
absence
of
a
finding
of
an
unfair
practice,
i
say
no.
i
don't
know
anything
in
the
board's
law
itself
nor
taft-hartley
where
the
board
can
order
the
company
to
do
anything
other
than
a
finding
that
good
faith
requires
it.
now
then,
as
we
see,
i
believe,
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice
vinson,
i
believe
it
was,
wrote
the
decision,
the
american
insurance
company
case,
there
was
a
--
a
key
point
there,
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
this
court
said,
"that
no
individual
refusal
per
se
can
automatically
be
bad-faith,"
the
statute
itself
says,
"no
company
shall
be
required
to
grant
a
concession."
now,
they
say
that
after
all
there
are
lots
of
other
concessions.
you've
got
to
grant
the
concession
of
giving
new
wage
data.
that
is
a
tool
of
bargaining.
the
courts
have
used
that
language.
if
the
union
has
bargained
with
me
as
to
wages,
they're
entitled
to
have
the
wage
data.
how
can
you
bargain
it
if
we
don't
know
what
we
are
talking
about?
they
are
entitled
to
know
the
seniority
list.
they're
entitled
to
know
something
about
time
studies
if
we
threw
that
into
the
--
the
makeup
of
the
contract.
but
we
say
and
the
court
below
said,
"that
information
about
our
company's
financial
status,
first
of
all,
it's
not
an
issue,
it's
not
bargainable.
and
second,
that
the
company
--
that
the
union
has
no
right
to
that."
now,
i
want
to
mention
just
a
little
bit
about
the
effect
of
this.
at
one
time
mr.
truitt,
the
elderly
president
of
our
company
said,
"why
don't
we
go
on
and
give
them
the
books."
and
his
boys,
the
vice
president
said,
"dad,
they
won't
understand."
they
said,
for
example,
"we
are
budgeting
some
$20,000
or
$30,000
a
year
for
advertising."
one
thing
they
do
down
there,
they
sponsor
some
basketball
games
down
at
state
college
and
our
good
basketball
in
that
area,
truitt
manufacturing
company
pays
for
the
broadcast
with
a
commercial
every
now
and
then
between
free-throws.
now,
the
union
has
said,
"why
in
the
world
are
you
wasting
money
on
that?"
now,
if
your
honor
please
and
this
applies
to
all
the
big
companies
in
the
united
states,
incidentally,
a
whole
a
bunch
of
them
in
the
last
two
weeks
had
been
writing
to
me
and
saying,
"for
god
sakes,
work
on
that
case."
i
don't
know
why
they
waited
until
now,
but
a
lot
of
them
had
been
rather
--
really
excited
about
it
lately.
now,
then
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
well,
at
least
they
knew
it
since
judge
parker
wrote
the
decision.
but
now
the
union
comes
along
and
says,
"why
do
you
spend
all
that
for
advertising?"
now,
granted
sir,
granted
that
we
open
the
books
and
the
books
disclose
that
advertising
budget
and
the
--
the
union,
i
don't
see
very
well
frankly
how
you
can
disclose
that
without
getting
into
an
argument
on
that
because
let's
say,
the
cpa,
whoever
it
is
come
backs
and
says,
"my
lord,
they're
spending
$30,000
a
year
for
advertising."
and
to
a
sweeper
in
our
plant
or
riveter
or
helper,
that's
an
awful
lot
of
money
and
they
can't
understand
it.
now,
are
we
going
to
open
the
books
and
then
start
blissfully
on
after
bargaining
or
will
we
not
get
in
a
quarrel
and
how
we
can
help
it?
i
don't
know.
when
they
start
telling
us,
"you're
spending
too
much
money
for
advertising."
my
wife
asked
me,
"how
much
money
we
made
last
month,"
i'm
not
going
to
tell
her
i
bought
a
supreme
court
digest.
you
think
one
time
up
there
and
you
got
to
buy
a
supreme
court
digest,
of
course,
she
doesn't
understand
that
i
need
it.
[laughter]
that
--
that's
a
little
foolish
maybe,
your
honors,
but
that
--
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
grossly
misunderstood
by
people
not
in
the
business
end.
now,
down
in
the
mclean
lumber
case,
in
--
in
arkansas,
the
company
offered
to
furnish
some
information
to
a
disinterested
third
party.
i
don't
believe
in
that
because
that
third
party
has
either
got
to
be
a
steelman,
who
understands
our
business
and
is
undoubtedly
a
competitor
or
a
cpa
who
puts
at
the
end
of
his
report,
this
was
made
according
to
accepted
accounting
practices,
but
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
accepted
steel
company
practices.
so,
we
don't
think
that
we
or
should
be
required
to
open
our
books
to
any
third
party.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
so
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
that's
all
right,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
--
we
never
--
actually
counsel
was
mistaken.
this
thing
never
came
up
about
any
further
discussion.
the
union
wrote
the
two
letters
and
we
answered
and
there
was
no
further
discussion
on
--
on
these
books
at
all.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
thought
at
that
time,
your
honor,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
board
law,
it's
all
that
has
split
and
the
board
had
said,
“if
you
say,
we'll
go
broke.
you've
got
to
open
the
books.”
the
--
the
board
has
never
said
if
you
plead
competition,
you
have
to
open
your
books.
and
consequently,
throughout
the
bargaining,
i
tried
my
best
to
hold
it
on
the
competition
grounds
because
there
was
no
law
about
that.
but
we
got
off,
appealed
and
i
--
i
fear
that
--
actually,
i
like
to
tell
you
this,
it's
not
in
the
record
but
it's
hypothetical.
we
had
a
bargaining
session
between
the
time
the
board
had
ordered
us
to
give
the
information
and
the
circuit
court
said,
“we
didn't
have
to.”
now,
with
the
law
in
that
status
where
as
far
as
our
--
our
concern,
it
might
be
that
we're
going
to
have
to
open
the
books
if
we
use
economic
matters,
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
you
said,
if
the
company
puts
it
on
any
other
basis.
if
they
don't
put
on
economics,
they
haven't
got
to
open
the
books
and
i
understood
counsel
to
say,
"no."
that
the
board's
order
says,
"you
open
the
books
only
if
you
plead
economics."
now,
how
you
can
argue
on
wages
without
getting
the
file
of
economics?
i
don't
know.
we
tried
it
once.
we
came
back
at
a
conclusion
of
this
contract
and
started
talking
wages
and
with
the
board's
order
before
me,
if
you
talk
economics
you
got
to
open
your
books
or
that's
the
way
i
interpreted
the
--
the
order.
we
spend
about
six
hours
in
the
most
awful
bargaining
you've
ever
seen
and
i
say
to
you
that
if
this
order
is
sustained,
it
will
not
help
the
bargain,
it
will
ruin
bargaining
because
here's
an
employer
who
for
reasons
of
his
own
does
not
want
to
disclose
his
financial
data
to
everybody.
what's
he
going
to
do?
the
board
says,
"if
you
talk
economics
open
come
your
books.
you
got
to
give
some
kind
of
reasons
other
than
economics."
i'm
satisfied
that
the
director,
regional
director
down
at
home
would
certainly
charge
us
with
refusal
to
bargain
if
we
just
said
no.
"oh,
why?"
"no."
"oh,
why
not?"
so,
what
did
we
do
in
this
time?
we
had
to
say,
“first
of
all,
you've
been
paid
too
much
already."
and
they
said,
"that's
no
good
reason."
i
said,
“i'll
think
of
another."
we
think
everyday
there
are
people
coming
applying
at
our
shop
for
work
at
our
rate,
at
our
wages,
that
indicates
plenty
of
people
walked
jobs
with
us
at
our
present
wages.
that
indicates
you're
being
paid
enough.
that's
not
a
good
reason.
i
called
up
the
employment
office.
i
went
back
to
the
union
and
said
they
got
another
reason.
there
are
plenty
of
people
waiting
on
the
list
there
to
come
down
here
at
our
pay.
and
we
had
the
worst
session
with
me
trying
carefully
to
skirt
any
economics
because
the
board
says,
"if
you
get
into
economics,
open
come
your
books."
and
trying
to
think
up
non-economic
reasons
on
wages
is
frustrating
to
say
the
least.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
for
refusing
to
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
the
time
the
board
order
came
through,
we
had
settled
our
differences
with
the
union.
we
were
happy,
working
fine
and
i
thought
that
the
board
order
would
--
i
didn't
know
what
it
would
be
if
they
tell
us
to
open
the
books
now
when
we've
settled
the
contract.
it
might
be
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
it
--
it
is,
sir,
except,
i
think,
if
this
court
were
to
send
this
order
back
and
sustain
and
order
us
to
follow
the
board's
order.
it
might
mean
nothing
to
us.
we're
a
small
time
outfit
down
there.
we're
getting
on
fine
with
the
union.
we're
operating
under
a
contract
right
now.
but
all
over
the
united
states
for
harassment
proceedings
as
judge
parker
said,
“a
union
could
use
the
management's
fear
to
open
their
books
as
a
club
to
force
management
into
giving
an
unjustified
wage
increase.”
what
is
it
mean
anyway,
if
--
if
the
court
please,
what
is
going
to
be
the
answer?
let's
say
first
of
all,
we
open
the
books
and
let
say
the
record
shows
we
were
lying,
that
we've
been
making
profit
until
it's
running
out
our
ears
and
we've
got
plenty
of
money
in
the
bank
and
we
have
pleaded
inability
to
pay.
there
is
no
law
in
the
world
that
i
know
of
it,
if
the
court
please,
that
says,
“truitt
company,
you
have
got
to
give
the
pay
raise.”
no
law
says
that.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
we've
got
a
two
year
agreement,
i
think
--
we
finished
it.
no,
sir,
i
believe
we
run
out,
next
february.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
no,
sir,
except
in
the
future.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
if
--
if
we
have
to
get
in
economics
and
the
question
again
is
and
i
--
i
think
this
is
the
end
of
thing
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
sir?
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
would
have
to
post
it.
that's
part
of
the
board's
penalty
to
post
a
notice
saying
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
--
"we've
been
bad
and
we're
going
to
be
good
from
now
on."
and
in
fact
the
board
in
good
faith,
the
board
after
its
order,
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
contract
had
been
settled
and
it
was
a
moot
question
and
agreed
they
would
drop
the
whole
thing
if
we
would
post
a
notice.
but
we
in
good
faith
said,
“we
don't
think
the
law
requires
us
to
open
these
books."
and
the
people
i
represent
says,
"we
will
go
to
the
highest
court
in
the
land."
folks
say
that
all
the
time."
i'll
go
to
the
highest
court
in
the
land,"
but
we're
here.
we'll
go
before
we
open
the
books
because
we
don't
think
we
are
suppose
to
and
we'll
not
post
a
notice.
so
the
board
says,
“all
right,
if
you
won't
post
a
notice
then
we'll
just
have
to
go
to
the
circuit
court
and
get
an
order
of
enforcement."
now,
one
final
thought,
the
--
the
extreme
to
which
this
goes,
the
board
order
itself,
i'm
getting
back
on
the
track
of
the
specific
language,
it
says,
“as
will
substantiate.”
now,
what
does
that
mean?
substantiate
usually
means
to
prove
to
somebody's
satisfaction.
and
we've
got
to
prove
to
the
board's
satisfaction.
counsel
has
said
that
we
didn't
plead
harm.
if
the
court
says
that
you've
got
to
plead
that
it'll
hurt
you
before
you
open
your
books,
then
every
management
in
the
country
is
going
to
plead
harm
and
you
got
to
open
the
books
to
let
the
board
decide
whether
it's
harmful
and
whether
you
should
have
opened
them
in
the
first
place.
so,
you
never
get
anywhere.
is
the
board
going
to
say,
if
we
plead
inability
to
pay
and
we
open
the
books
and
the
books
prove
that
we're
correct,
is
the
board
going
to
say,
"now
the
union,
if
you
strike
in
the
face
of
that,
you're
in
bad-faith?"
you
know
the
answer.
the
board
is
going
to
say,
“no,
the
union's
got
a
right
to
strike
anytime
they
want.”
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
i
think
we
could,
your
honor,
except
that
--
let
--
let's
say
that
the
--
that
the
monthly
operating
statement
we
give
them
is
for
the
last
month.
let's
say
we
had
a
real
good
month,
last
month
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
let's
--
let's
say
we
had
a
good
year
and
the
board
--
the
board
says,
"give
them
your
operating
statement
for
one
year."
now,
then
the
union
sees,
we
made
$50,000
profit,
we'll
say,
last
year.
the
union
says,
"we're
going
to
have
our
share
of
that."
we
say,
"oh,
no.
the
two
years
before
that,
we
operated
at
a
loss,
our
machineries
in
bad
shape,
we
have
got
to
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
and
incidentally,
sir
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
--
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
can't
afford
it
and
we
have
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
--
competition.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
i
think,
sir,
that
we
could
and
i
think
we
would
and
in
the
board's
brief
they
talked
about
this
studebaker
case.
remember,
studebaker
said,
"we
be
--
they've
got
to
cut
pay
or
go
out
of
business,"
and
from
the
bargaining
strategy
they
said,
the
company
did,
"we
better
show
the
union
our
books,"
and
the
success
of
that
strategy
prove
because
the
union,
seeing
studebaker's
books
did
accept
the
pay
cut.
now,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
all
these
writers
on
this
subject,
i
--
i've
never
written
about
bargaining.
i
--
i
make
my
living
in
it,
and
all
these
writers
who
say,
"it's
a
wonderful
thing
to
give
the
union
information."
sure
it
is
in
certain
strategic
points
and
we
may
very
well
as
mr.
truitt
said
one
time,
"let's
give
them
the
books."
but
we
don't
think
the
government
ought
to
order
us
to
give
the
books
and
that
we
may
very
well
--
mr.
r.d.
douglas,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
this,
sir.
it's
not
in
the
record.
outside
of
the
company
office
one
afternoon
after
one
of
these
sessions,
i've
said
to
the
organizer,
"would
you
be
satisfied
if
we
told
you,
we
haven't
paid
any
dividends
and
showed
you
the
last
month's
profit
loss,"
and
he
says,
"no.
you
can
doctor
those
all
you
want.
we
want
our
cpa
to
go
in
the
books."
and
that's
what
the
letter
said,
to
lay
it
before
an
accountant.
thank
you.
