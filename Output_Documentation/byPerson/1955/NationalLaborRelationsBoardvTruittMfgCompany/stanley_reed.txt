stanley

well,
the
information
to
that
kind
would
necessary
be,
would
it
not,
the
--
not
of
wages
that
they've,
the
amount
of
other
expenses
that
they
had,
the
cost
of
the
manufacture
goods
so
that
there
would
be
a
complete
statistical
survey
of
the
business
of
the
company?
justice
stanley
reed
and
that's
what
they
were
ordered
to
do,
wasn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
was
that
statistical
and
other
information
as
will
substantiate?
justice
stanley
reed
but
that
means
--
and
that's
exactly
the
same
language
as
the
board
used
in
the
jacobs
case
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
there,
that
means
simply
that
the
company
has
to
come
forward
with
reasonable
data
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
--
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
know
whether
they
have
to
or
not
but
under
the
order
to
substantiate
the
fact
that
they
we're
losing
money
and
the
amount
of
their
lost,
are
they
not
--
their
gained
would
require
practically
statistical
abstract
of
their
books.
justice
stanley
reed
they're
go
to
substantiate
it.
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
have
to
post
a
notice
of
that?
justice
stanley
reed
if
you
lose
this,
you'd
have
to
post
a
notice?
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you're
willing.
