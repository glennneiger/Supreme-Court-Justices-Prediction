mr.
david
p.
findling
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
the
labor
board
has
brought
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
presents
the
question
whether
the
obligation
to
bargain
collectively
in
good
faith
under
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
requires
an
employer
who
claims
during
bargaining
negotiation
that
he
can't
afford
to
pay
a
wage
increase
asked
by
a
union
to
furnish
the
union
on
request
with
pertinent
information
to
support
its
claim
of
inability
to
pay.
the
facts
are
virtually
undisputed
and
the
case
arose
in
this
context.
during
wage
negotiations
starting
in
august
1953
pursuant
to
a
wage
reopening
clause
of
the
contract
between
local
729
of
the
ironworkers
union
and
the
company.
the
union
asked
for
a
wage
increase
of
10
cents
(inaudible)
the
company
rejected
the
request
and
offered
two
and
a
half
cents,
claiming
in
effect
that
it
couldn't
afford
to
pay
more.
in
that
connection,
the
company's
representatives
express
principally
that
they
are
already
paying
higher
wage
rates
than
most
of
their
competitors
in
the
area
and
that
the
company
was
already
being
underbid
on
certain
jobs
by
some
of
its
competitors,
but
the
company
also
said
that
it
was
under
capitalized,
that
it
was
operating
under
a
financial
strain,
that
its
margin
of
profits
in
relation
to
cost
in
sales
was
low
that
it
never
paid
any
dividends,
that
it
is
just
negotiated
the
bank
loan
for
a
new
equipment
and
a
new
lot
and
that
at
least
suggested
that
overhead
was
too
high
because
of
inefficient
office
and
perhaps
plant
procedures.
after
engaging
in
an
unsuccessful
strike
for
about
a
week
in
support
of
its
wage
demands
and
after
the
company
had
put
into
effect
the
two
and
a
half
cent
increase
that
it
has
offered
to
the
union,
the
union
asked
the
company
to
furnish
it
with
information
as
to
the
company's
financial
situation
in
support
of
its
claim
that
it
couldn't
afford
to
pay
more
than
two
and
a
half
cents.
while
that
request
was
put
in
different
language
from
time
to
time,
i
think
it's
fair
to
sum
it
up
as
the
union
negotiator,
summed
it
up
with
the
labor
board
hearing
when
he
said
--
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
pages
15
and
16
of
the
record,
he
said
that,
"the
union
wanted
anything
relating
to
the
company's
position,
any
records
or
what
have
you,
books,
accounting
sheets,
cost,
expenditures,
whatnot,
anything
to
back
the
company's
position
that
they're
unable
to
give
any
more
money."
the
company
offered
to
show
that
the
wage
rates
that
some
of
its
competitors
were
paying
and
it
also
submitted
some
bid
sheets,
showing
contracts
that
it
had
lost
but
otherwise
it
refused
the
union's
request.
it
didn't
say
that
disclosure
would
be
damaging
to
some
legitimate
business
interest.
it
didn't
claim
that
the
union's
request
was
too
broad
or
irrelevant
to
its
claim
of
inability
to
pay
nor
did
it
suggest
that
the
union's
request
was
unreasonable
in
any
other
way.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
we
suggest
that
some
of
the
data
was
readily
available.
the
company
simply
took
the
position
in
substance
and
again
i'm
quoting
from
its
statement
of
position,
“that
final
information
concerning
its
affairs
was
confidential
and
not
pertinent
to
the
discussion,
that
such
information
was
not
a
subject
of
--
a
subject
matter
of
bargaining
or
discussing
with
the
union
and
that
the
union
had
no
legal
right
to
it."
the
union
pointed
out
that
it
wasn't
claiming
any
legal
right
to
bargain
about
the
company's
financial
affairs,
but
said
the
information
was
necessary
so
that
the
men
could
decide
whether
they
were
to
press
their
demand
for
the
10
cent
increase.
and
the
union
also
said
that
the
company's
failure
to
supply
the
information
created
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
a
successful
conclusion
of
the
bargaining.
the
union
representatives
also
said
in
substance
that
the
men
believed
the
company
was
making
money
and
could
afford
to
pay
the
10
cents.
that
it
was
hard
for
the
men
to
see
or
understand
the
overhead
and
all
that
stuff
as
they
put
it.
that
the
union
believed
the
company
competed
with
other
companies
outside
the
immediate
geographic
area
who
were
paying
higher
wage
rates
than
the
company,
and
who
were
nevertheless
operating
profitably.
and
they
said
that
if
the
company
really
wasn't
making
money,
the
men
wanted
to
be
shown
some
proof
of
it
and
that
they
simply
couldn't
take
mr.
truitt's
word
for
it.
the
company
continued
at
its
refusal
to
furnish
the
information,
however,
insisting
as
i
say
that
the
information
was
none
of
the
union's
business.
and
so,
there
was
--
there
was
no
discussion
of
how
much
information,
what
kind
of
information
or
what
form
the
information
should
take
nor
was
there
any
discussion
whether
it
would
be
satisfactory
for
the
company
to
go
through
its
records
and
submit
the
data
to
the
union
or
to
an
accountant
or
whether
the
union
was
insisting
that
an
accountant
can
come
in
and
go
over
to
the
company's
books
and
select
the
data
that
he
thought
was
pertinent.
and
so,
instead
of
supplying
the
data,
the
company
went
ahead
that
christmas
and
paid
the
men
a
bonus,
a
larger
bonus
than
it
had
paid
in
several
years.
and
a
little
later
on,
on
january
13th,
it
offered
the
union
two
and
half
cents
more,
conditional
for
90
days.
an
offer
which
it
subsequently
withdrew
for
which
one
of
the
union
committeemen
pointed
out,
emphasized
the
need
for
the
information
because
if
the
company
withdrew
the
--
the
raise
after
90
days,
the
men
naturally
would
want
to
know
why.
now
on
these
facts,
the
board
found
that
the
company
had
failed
to
satisfy
the
collective
bargaining
requirements
of
the
act,
reaffirming
the
position
that
it
has
consistently
taken
on
this
matter
since
it
had
first
occasioned
to
discuss
it.
back
in
1936,
in
volume
1
of
the
n.l.r.b.
reports,
the
board
held
that
the
collective
bargaining
obligation
to
deal
with
the
union
in
a
good
faith
effort
to
compose
differences
and
to
reach
a
contract
if
possible,
required
the
company
--
required
the
company
having
faced
its
refusal
of
a
wage
increase
on
its
inability
to
pay
it,
attempt
on
request
by
the
union
to
substantiate
its
economic
position
by
reasonable
proof.
the
board,
therefore,
ordered
the
company
to
bargain
collectively
and
on
request
to
furnish
the
union
and
i'm
quoting
from
this
decision,
"with
such
statistical
and
other
information
that
would
substantiate
the
company's
position
of
inability
to
pay
and
would
enable
the
union
to
discharge
its
functions
as
the
statutory
representative
of
the
employees
in
the
appropriate
unit."
mr.
david
p.
findling
no,
your
honor.
if
the
--
if
the
company
had
not
put
its
--
its
claim
of
--
its
refusal
on
inability
to
pay,
there
had
been
no
--
no
obligation.
mr.
david
p.
findling
no
question
about
that.
mr.
david
p.
findling
your
honor,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
definition
of
the
obligation
to
bargain
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
and
i
--
i
would
think
that
in
particular
circumstances,
the
board
might
well
have
power
to
require
the
submission
of
books
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
even
though
an
employer
was
acting
in
good
faith
because
of
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
the
--
the
company
offered
to
show
the
wage
rates
its
competitors
were
paying,
some
of
them
and
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
involved.
the
board
has
not
held
that
the
company
must
necessarily
show
its
books
and
the
order
in
this
case,
doesn't
talk
about
books.
the
board
says,
"you
got
to
submit
reasonable
proof
in
support
of
your
claim
of
inability
to
pay."
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
jacobs
case
and
in
mclean-arkansas
case,
board
decision.
mclean-arkansas
was
decided
three
months
before
this
case
was
decided
and
both
jacobs
and
mclean-arkansas
are
cited
in
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
and
mclean
arkansas,
the
company,
was
asked
to
submit
books.
the
company
said,
“i
won't
submit
books
but
we'll
give
you
a
--a
statement
from
our
accountants
as
to
our
financial
condition,"
and
the
--
they
offered
in
letters
and
memoranda
to
give
further
information,
the
board
said
that
the
company
had
discharged
its
obligation.
mr.
david
p.
findling
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
but,
your
honor,
it
wasn't
the
question
simply
of
opening
the
books
and
records.
the
board
found
that
the
company
had
refused
to
give
any
information.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes.
but
they
didn't
give
the
information
that
was
adequate
in
order
to
discharge
the
responsibility
that
let
the
union
know
what
the
basis
was
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
for
its
claim
of
inability
to
pay.
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
your
honor,
the
board's
order
doesn't
require
the
company
to
open
its
books?
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
data
they
gave
that's
the
wage
rates
of
their
competitors
and
also
bids
that
they
had
lost
wasn't
the
basis
upon
which
they
were
placing
their
inability
to
--
their
claim
of
inability
to
pay.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
company
admitted
that
itself
because
at
the
meeting
on
november
24,
the
company
asked
the
union
to
defer
further
bargaining
sessions
until
after
christmas
because
auditors
had
been
in
who
had
suggested
that
improvement
in
overhead
might
put
the
--
the
company
in
a
better
position
and
the
company
was
suggesting
that
when
those
innovations
were
put
into
a
effect,
the
company
might
well
be
able
to
pay.
now,
that
had
nothing
to
do
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
with
the
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
if
we
are
right
in
our
position
that
it's
the
employer's
responsibility,
it's
his
duty,
part
of
his
duty
that
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act
when
he
says
he
is
unable
to
pay
to
disclose
the
pertinent
data
on
which
he
rest
that
conclusion.
if
we're
right
about
that,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
company
failed
to
discharge
that
responsibility
in
good
or
bad-faith.
anymore
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
anymore
than
a
company
can
defend
its
failure,
for
example,
to
discuss
a
pension
plan
because
it
in
good
faith
things
but
it's
not
required
to
do
it.
it
is
--
no
--
nor
was
it
a
defense
under
the
wagner
act
for
example,
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
put
a
contract
in
writing
after
terms
were
agreed
on
and
that
was
without
regard,
it
was
good
or
bad-faith
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
and
that's
our
position
here.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
of
course
it
says
good
faith
but
there
are
certain
things
like
recognition
of
a
union,
bargaining
about
wages,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment,
exchanging
relevant
information
and
so
on
that
as
a
matter
of
--
of
a
definition
of
the
duty
to
bargain.
we
think
they're
encompassed
within
the
statutory
terms
and
as
i
say,
if
we're
right
that
the
statutory
obligation
to
bargain
includes
not
only
mere
recognition
but
the
duty
to
sit
down,
to
deal
with
an
open
mind,
to
attempt
to
compose
differences,
to
exchange
pertinent
information
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
and
so
on,
then
if
an
employer
doesn't
in
some
--
if
--
if
an
employer
fails
in
some
respect
to
discharge
it,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he's
done
it
in
good
faith
or
bad-faith
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
anymore
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
we're
trying
to
pro
--
i
was
--
i
was
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
we're
ready
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
we're
ready
to
concede.
i'll
accept
the
formulation
but
we're
ready
to
concede
that
the
company
in
--
apparently
in
good
faith
thought
that
it
wasn't
required
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
in
the
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
to
--
to
submit
the
data.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
i
don't
mean
to
expunge
it
out
and
the
board
found
that
the
failure
to
submit
the
data
was
a
failure,
it
resulted
in
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
company
to
discharge
its
responsibility
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
--
on
proceedings
to
set
the
order
aside
because
of
proceedings
to
enforce
has
set
aside
the
order
and
chief
judge
parker,
speaking
for
the
court,
held
in
substance
that
the
statutory
obligation
to
bargain
didn't
require
the
company
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
opinion,
“to
open
up
its
books
or
bargain
with
respect
to
matters
which
lie
within
the
province
of
management
such
as
the
financial
condition
of
the
company,
its
manufacturing
cost,
or
the
payment
of
dividends."
"disclosure
of
which,
the
court
said,
could
conceivably
be
used
to
the
company's
great
damage."
now,
as
i
--
as
i
think
i
made
plain
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
the
board
didn't
find
here
that
the
company
was
required
to
open
up
its
books
and
records
at
such
nor
did
it
find,
it
doesn't
order
the
company
to
open
up
its
books
and
records
and
the
refusal,
the
company's
failure
to
bargain
is
not
based
on
a
failure
to
open
up
the
books
and
records
of
such.
it's
based
on
the
company's
failure
to
submit
and
i'm
quoting,
"reasonable
proof
of
its
financial
situation,"
and
the
board's
decision,
including
decisions
cited
in
the
--
cited
in
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
make
that
plain.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
it,
he
is
free.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
--
if
he
says,
"i'm
unable
to
pay
a
wage
--
the
wage
increase
you
asked,"
the
board's
position
is
that
he
is
required,
if
the
union
asked
for
it,
to
submit
some
reasonable
documentation
of
his
position
so
that
the
bargaining
can
proceed
from
there
with
understanding,
with
a
responsibility,
with
the
discussion
of
what's
important
to
the
issues,
otherwise
the
union
is
in
a
position
of
bargaining
in
the
dark
so
to
speak.
it
can't
--
it
can't
discuss
the
issues
intelligently
because
it
doesn't
know
the
basis
on
which
the
employer's
refusal
was
based.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
employer
can
simply
sit
back
and
say,
"i
can't
afford
to
pay
but
i'm
unwilling
to
tell
you
why,
on
want
basis
i
reached
that
conclusion."
the
bargaining
process
may
be
frustrated
at
its
very
beginning
by
a
simple
statement
of,
"i
just
can't
pay."
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
employer
comes
forward
with
documentation,
the
union
is
in
a
position
to
know
whether
it
should
insist
on
its
demand
or
receive
from
it.
it
can
discuss
the
problems
of
the
employer
has
and
i
think
as
the
board
has
held
and
students
of
the
subject
all
agree,
documentation
of
that
kind
is
necessary
if
bargaining
is
to
proceed
on
a
responsible,
a
reasonable
basis.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
in
this
case?
mr.
david
p.
findling
they
were
ordered
to
submit
reasonable
proof
to
substantiate
the
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i'm
just
--
i
beg
you're
pardon,
sir.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
of
course,
its
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
it
depend
--
it
would
depend
on
the
course
of
bargaining
and
so
on.
now,
the
board
had
found,
for
example,
in
mclean-arkansas
to
which
i
just
referred
that
when
the
company
said,
"well,
we'll
give
--
we'll
give
you
a
statement
prepared
by
our
accountant,
the
showing
of
our
earnings
last
year,"
and
then
also
furnish
a
memoranda
with
respect
to
the
company's
cost
and
prospects
that
that
was
adequate,
didn't
have
to
show
its
books.
in
the
montgomery
ward
case
several
years
ago,
the
board
--
the
company
had
made
a
survey
of
wage
cost
of
its
--
wage
rates
of
its
competitors
and
offered
to
show
the
names
of
the
competitors
what
the
wage
rates
were
but
wouldn't
disclose
wage
rates
paid
details
as
to
wage
rates
paid
by
particular
competitors.
and
the
board
said
that
the
company
had
gotten
that
information
in
confidence
and
it
didn't
require
the
company
to
go
further.
it
said
that
they'd
given
reasonably
adequate
information
and
case
after
case
makes
claim.
the
board
said
repeatedly
that
no
one
reasonable
or
a
burden
is
contemplated
and
that
the
information
does
not
have
to
take
any
particular
form.
it
depends
on
substance
and
as
i
say
if
the
substance
of
the
information
is
given
in
--
in
some
form
or
another
so
that
the
parties
can
bargain
intelligently
that's
enough.
and
of
course,
and
the
board
has
said
this
that,
of
course,
how
much
information,
what
form
and
so
on,
that
will
depend
on
the
cost
of
bargaining
in
each
case
but
the
company
foreclosed
that
here.
it
simply
took
the
position
that
it
was
none
of
the
union's
business
and
they
never
even
talked
about
what
kind
of
information
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
should
be
supplied.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
in
the
jacobs
case,
the
order
in
the
jacobs
case
is
worded
exactly
the
same
as
the
order
in
this
case
and
the
board
cited
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
jacobs
case
in
this
case.
and
in
that
case
mr.
--
circuit
judge
chase
said,
"we
do
not
understand
this
part
of
the
order,"
that's
the
language
we've
been
talking
about,
"to
do
more
than
show
its
good
faith
in
bargaining
collectively,"
this
probably
ought
to
require
the
company
to
do
more
than
and
show
its
good
faith."
to
bargain
collectively
in
compliance
with
the
statute
does
not
mean
that
an
employer
must
produce
proof
to
establish
that
he
is
right
in
his
business
decision
as
to
what
he
can
and
cannot
afford
to
do.
he
is
left
free
to
decide
that
himself
and
at
the
end
of
the
bargaining
may
agree
only
insofar
as
he's
willing
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances."
the
board's
order
does
not
require
the
company
to
produce
any
specific
business,
books
and
records
but
information
to
substantiate
its
position
in
bargaining
with
the
union.
as
we
interpret
this,
the
requirement
of
disclosure
will
be
met
if
the
respondent
produces
whatever
relevant
information
it
has
to
indicate
whether
it
can
or
cannot
afford
to
comply
with
the
union's
demand.
and
in
the
mclean-arkansas
case,
which
the
board
also
cited
in
its
decision
in
this
case,
the
board
adopted
the
findings
of
a
trial
examiner
which
said
in
affect
that
exactly
the
same
thing.
now,
of
course
the
word
"substantiate"
and
"proof"
carry
connotations,
perhaps.
they're
a
little
different.
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
as
to
what
the
board's
position
is.
perhaps,
a
word
different
than
substantiate
might
be
used.
but
the
board's
position
is
exactly
that
set
forth
in
jacobs
and
mclean-arkansas,
the
cases
show
it.
it's
been
that
--
that's
been
the
board's
position
since
--
as
i
say,
since
the
first
had
occasioned
to
consider
this
problem
back
in
1936.
mr.
david
p.
findling
no,
your
honor.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
disclosure
of
the
information
might
result
in
serious
damage
to
the
company.
it's
some
legitimate
business
interest
to
the
company,
but
the
company
never
suggested
to
the
board
that
any
legitimate
business
interest
was
involved
and
the
board's
cases
again
made
clear
that
if
--
if
that
were
an
issue,
it
be
an
entirely
different
--
been
entirely
different
case.
and
so,
when
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
to
require
the
information
would
--
might
conceivably
result
to
damage,
it
was
passing
on
an
issue
that
hadn't
been
raised
before
the
board
or
decided
by
the
board
and
that
really
isn't
germane
to
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
also
thought
that
the
board's
order
required
the
company
to
make
a
concession
in
violation
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
which
provides
that
the
duty
to
bargain
shall
not
be
construed
to
--
require
a
concession
and
of
course
the
concession
was
opening
the
books
and
giving
information.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
the
company
accepted
principally
on
the
preposition
that
it
wasn't
claiming
inability
to
pay.
it
was
simply
basing
its
claim
of
--
of
refusal
to
give
the
wage
increase
on
competitive
conditions.
now,
the
trial
examiner
found
that
in
fact
the
refusal
was
based
on
inability
to
pay,
the
board
approved
that
finding.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disturb
it
and
i
don't
think
it's
--
it's
of
interest.
here,
the
record
totally
supports
it.
and
in
any
event,
even
if
--
even
if
the
company
was
putting
its
refusal
on
competitive
conditions,
we
think
that
simply
another
way
of
saying
in
effect
that
it
can't
afford
to
pay
it
because
if
i
can
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
we
think
that
when
the
company
was
saying
here
that
competitive
conditions
precluded
its
--
it
ran
into
wage
increase,
it
was
in
effect
saying,
"we
can't
pay
it,"
because
we
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor.
no,
they
weren't,
we
feel.
what
they
were
willing
to
do
was
show
the
wage
rates
some
of
their
competitors
were
paying
those
in
the
immediate
geographic
area.
and
the
union
was
saying
that,
"well,
you
compete
with
companies
outside
the
immediate
geographic
area
also
who
pay
higher
wages
and
they're
also
willing
to
--
to
show
that
they'd
lost
some
bids.
they'd
been
underbid
on
some
contracts."
but
competitive
conditions
include
overhead.
the
company
made
that
plain
itself
as
i
said
before,
when
it
said,
"if
you'll
just
wait
until
after
christmas
when
we
put
these
innovations
in
the
office
and
plant
procedures,
we
may
able
to
give
you
an
increase
besides
that."
i
suppose
competitive
conditions
wold
turn
also
on
productivity,
capitalization,
the
company
talked
about
that,
dividend
policy
and
so
on.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
we
concede
--
we
concede
they
were
negotiating
but
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
--
but
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
no.
but
your
honor,
what
--
what
they
were
doing
was
saying,
as
we
see
it
was
this.
as
we
understand
it
our
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
doesn't
include
any
exchange
of
information
about
our
financial
affairs
and
so
on.
that's
out.
it's
none
of
your
business.
and
we
say
that
it
does
and
we
say
that
if
we're
right
about
that,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
company
thought
honestly
that
it
didn't
have
to
exchange
information
or
not.
it
simply
didn't
discharge
its
responsibility
here.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
so.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
think
usually
the
board
says,
"submit
reasonable
proof,"
and
then
--
well,
it
said
in
so
many
cases
that
all
we're
saying
is
that
you
sit
down
and
submit
reasonable
proof
vested
in
your
claim
of
inability
to
pay
and
the
board
adds,
now
exactly
what
form
that's
to
take,
how
much
and
so
on,
the
details.
that's
to
be
worked
out
in
the
conversations,
we
don't
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
and
if
you
deal
in
good
faith
on
that
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
thank
you.
we
haven't
fully
researched
that
and
if
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
certainly.
mr.
david
p.
findling
gladly.
mr.
david
p.
findling
certainly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
no.
mr.
david
p.
findling
no
refusals
in
writing
but
there's
oral,
there
was
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
that
the
subject
came
up
at
other
meetings,
there
were
oral
conversations
and
so
on.
