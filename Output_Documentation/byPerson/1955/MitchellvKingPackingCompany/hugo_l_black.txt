what
read

what
page
is
that
on
the
brief?
do
you
know?

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
fact
that
this
court
construed
legislature?
it
construed
and
they
bring
up
the
difference
and
congress
wants
to
change
it,
make
it
wrong
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
judicial
and
legislative
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
--
which
one
was
for
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
was
charged
by
the
committee
with
the
special
responsibility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
knife
--
if
knife-sharpening
is
not
as
--
as
is
argued
by
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
if
knife-sharpening
is
not
included
that
time,
then
senator
barkley
was
mislead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
ms.
margolin
is
wrong
about
the
position
you
take
about
the
knife
--
knife-sharpening
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
senator
barkley
was
mislead,
wasn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wasn't?
he
asked
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
senator
cooper?
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
senator
--
senator
barley
just
wanted
to
know
of
the
--
the
time
people
spent
on
sharpening
their
knives
like
these
are
doing
here
would
be
compensable.
senator
cooper
said
they
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
disagreed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
it
should
be
held
now
that
senator
barkley,
that
senator
cooper
was
wrong,
we
would
be
holding
that
he
--
he
didn't
understand
that
phase
of
the
bill
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
was
dealing
with
knife-sharpening
at
the
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
include
the
word
“such
as”
to
be
the
same
as
though
that
you
said
“all.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
knife
got
dull
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
knife
got
dull
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
spent
precisely
the
same
amount
of
time
in
sharpening
it
that
they
did
before
him
after.
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
--
you
would
say
that
even
though
it
was
absolutely
essential
that
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
or
in
the
middle
of
his
work,
if
that
knife
to
be
sharper,
he
couldn't
keep
his
work
out.
that
if
he
sharpened
it
for
10
to
15
minutes,
then
that
wouldn't
be
work
time
compensable
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
that
would
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
comes
in
15
to
20
minutes
earlier
and
finds
out
what
the
knife
is
dull,
and
he,
instead
of
doing
it
before
he
starts
down
into
the
work,
he
waits
until
it
gets
at
his
place
then
he
spends
15
minutes
sharpening
it,
would
he
be
--
would
that
be
compensable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
didn't
say,
“now,
sharpen
your
knife.”
the
man
knows
it
needs
sharpening
but
he
waits
until
the
whistle
blows.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
argument
--
your
argument
is
in
fact
is
that
from
whistle
to
whistle.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
compensable,
for
sharpening
your
knife.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
the
question
i
was
asking
you
was
not
that
you
are
hired
merely
to
be
a
knife
sharper.
you
are
hired
to
cut
meat
and
the
knife
had
to
be
sharp
and
it
was
--
and
you
have
to
do
the
sharpening.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
if
he
does
that
sharpening
during
the
time
from
whistle
to
whistle,
he
can
be
paid
for
it,
but
if
he
does
it
in
advance
of
the
whistle
or
after
the
whistle,
he
cannot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
draw
the
distinction
between
greasing
his
lathe
and
sharpening
his
knife
when
he
can't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
he
can't
do
his
work
without
that
either.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
employed
to
operate
the
knife.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
employed
the
operator
knife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
--
what
did
he
do
with
the
knife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
he
do
that
for
the
knife?
would
he
do
that
for
the
knife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
is
the
part
of
the
report
you
referred
to
lathe,
where
they
said
tool
sharpening
was
not
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
what
part
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
18?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
say
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
it
--
where
did
it
specifically
exclude
tool
sharpening?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
it's
because
they
had
some
tool
sharpening
there
and
they
said,
“this
is
such
as
that
that's
the
same
as
though
they
had
said
tool
sharpening
is
out.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
right
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
report.
i
understood
you
to
say
it
was
clearly
in
your
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
it
incorporate
this
court's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
suppose
senator
barkley
had
read
it
and
when
he
was
asking
and
you
suppose
senator
cooper
had
read
it
when
he
told
him
that
it
didn't
do
sharpening?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
read
the
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
that,
that
he
grants
a
certificate.
