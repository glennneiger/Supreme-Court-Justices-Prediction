i
--
i
suppose
that
even
a
confused
commentary
by
legislative
is
not
criminal.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
that
legislative
history
doesn't
waive
whether
the
defendant
ever
made
the
speeches,
was
confused
or
not.
that
would
soon
further
complicate
our
difficulties
here
to
decide
whether
he
may
talk
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
(inaudible)
to
refine
the
speech,
and
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
fine
distinction
becomes
the
principle
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
very
rare
to
a
situation
like
this.
they're
making
these
questions
of
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
the
--
the
courts
do
is
important
to
us
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
is
supposed
to
be
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
saying
this
probability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
define
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
the
(inaudible)
he
rejected
the
suggestion
that
all
preliminary,
he
didn't
say,
“no
preliminary
and
no
postliminary.”
he
rejected
the
suggestion
that
all
preliminary
which
are
integrated
and
related
to
the
principal
activity
are
constrained,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
he
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
--
i'm
suggesting
the
legal
criterion
which
he
stated
is
predicated
and
said
this
may
lead
to
another
part
of
(inaudible)
--
lead
to
a
different
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
conflict,
though
inevitable
as
you
say
where
you
got
a
legislation
like
this
as
though
a
diversion
on
the
courts
and
not
make
some
administrative
agency
the
determiner
of
the
facts
in
a
different
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
result
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
also
let
the
legislation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
followed
and
it
should
have
gone
to
from
my
point
of
view
and
did
go
that
way
because
--
well,
the
case
of
this
court
will
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
the
varying
opinions
on
the
fact
that
the
constructions
given
by
this
court
let
the
congress
go
the
other
way
and
that
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
controversies
before
the
amendment,
ms.
margolin?
i
--
i'm
referring
from
--
from
the
fact
that
there
was
administrative
bulletin
for
rendering
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
chemical
in
the
earlier
cases?
well,
if
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
these
conflicts
derived
from
the
board
--
that
the
board
will
ask?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
mt.
clemens
record
as
it
came
here
--
as
it
came
here,
was
it
allowed
or
disallowed
gathering
from
what
you
said?
it
slipped
through
my
mind.
i
thought
it
was
partly
and
i
didn't
know
the
proviso
involved
in
this
case.
now,
was
there
an
item
for
the
knives
which
--
and
it
came
here
was
allowed
or
disallowed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
follow,
i
suppose
this
(inaudible)
to
say
or
could
say,
that
--
that
because
of
some
necessary,
something
deemed
necessary
on
mt.
clemens
were
now
no
longer
after
the
portal-to-portal
act
dispensable,
that
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
establish.
that
isn't
the
equation
which
proved
that
those
necessary
things
which
are
part
of
what
he
calls
the
(inaudible)
have
also
been
cutoff
by
portal-to-portal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

questions
down
to
the
argument
as
i
understand
it
that
principle
activity
is
almost
a
term
of
art
and
doesn't
mean
that
which
takes
most
of
the
day
in
doing
but
that
which
is
of
indispensable
part,
not
every
--
just
walking
down
from
--
from
the
entrance,
way
down
below
it,
just
entered
by
(inaudible)
six
floors
down
below
which
is
certain.
walking
down
isn't
a
necessary
part
of
cutting
meat
or
chopping
it
nicely.
i
don't
know
why
this
(inaudible)
--[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
you
doing
with
--
what
are
you
doing
with
mr.
cooper's
observation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
senator
barkley
wasn't
mislead,
he
disagreed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
he
wasn't
mislead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
cooper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
senator
cooper
wasn't
dealing
with
our
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
dealing
with
a
--
a
different
case
than
we
have
which
i
would
like
to
go
into
tomorrow
if
i
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
the
short
answer
is
that
it
--
that
includes
preliminary
or
post
preliminary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
times
--
those
are
time
excluded.
and
if
for
any
reason,
he
chooses
to
wait
and
sharpen
your
knife
until
he
gets
going,
whatever
other
consequence,
whatever
problems
that
may
raise,
does
not
affect
outside
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
times
that
were
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
because
that's
the
principal
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
johnston,
i
would
like
you
to
explain
as
why
the
report
deemed
to
be
appropriate
to
--
to
define
to
have
that
include,
all
activities,
which
are
in
integral
part
thereof.
presumably,
that
was
put
in
because
the
term
itself
principal
activity
wouldn't
define
its
scope.
now,
what
do
they
mean
to
exclude
or
include
by
putting
into
that
defining
clause?
why
should
they
probably
say
include
all
activity
which
are
an
integral
part
thereof?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
(inaudible)
the
proper
to
answer.
you
say
it
isn't
to
guard
against
able
lawyers
to
say
that
the
time
they
take
to
grease
the
lathe
is
not
to
be
taken
into
account
because
his
job
is
to
move
the
lathe,
move
or
whenever
it
is.
i
think
it's
about
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
handle
the
lathe
and
greasing
is
not
the
activity,
and
therefore,
it's
out
of
an
abundance
of
quashing
or
put
in
to
take
care
of
those
which
were
related
to
what
he
has
been
doing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
excluded,
not
explicitly,
not
merely
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
record
and
make
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
attributing
to
the
right
of
the
report
the
fact
that
he
read
the
opinion
of
this
court
to
mt.
clemens,
are
you
doing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
--
on
this,
what
you
must
say
about
the
bearing
of
this
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
party,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
this
is
a
subject
matter
of
collective
bargaining
and
rejected
in
the
--
in
the
in
the
term
briefed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
to
say
is
that
the
party
did
not
agree
on
this
subject,
i
mean,
it
did
not
included
in
that
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
it
shows
that
it
was
proposed
in
the
collective
bargaining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
wasn't
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
would
be
equally
true
if
the
man
works
as
--
as
busy
and
do
possibly
in
the
same
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
say
some.
it
didn't
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
say
some
of
the
