i'll
proceed
with
the
next
case.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
case
if
the
court
please,
involved
the
question
of
where
the
time
spent
by
a
knifeman
in
a
meatpacking
plant
sharpening
the
knives
that
they
use
in
their
meat-cutting
job
is
a
part
of
a
knifeman's
principal
activity
rather
than
preliminary
and
postliminary
under
section
4,
the
portal
act,
and
whether
it's
still
compensable
despite
the
provision
of
the
portal
act.
the
tenth
--
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it
was
--
there
was
non-compensable
and
was
--
because
it
was
preliminary
and
postliminary
despite
its
recognition
that
it
probably
and
might
be
anyway
an
indispensable
to
the
performance
of
their
productive
work.
the
evidence
shows
indisputably
and
respondent
doesn't
dispute
that
the
knives
must
be
sharpened
daily
in
order
for
them
to
be
of
any
practical
value
in
the
work.
as
stated
by
one
witness,
they
must
be
razor
sharp
and
unless
he
had
a
sharp
knife,
he
couldn't
do
a
good
job.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
serious
question
that
the
sharp
knife
is
absolutely
indispensable
to
be
proper
efficient
or
any
adequate
performance
of
the
meat-cutting
job.
ms.
bessie
margolin
some
of
the
knives
of
--
mainly,
the
knives
that
--
theoretically,
they
are
the
employee's
knives.
he
buys
them,
most
of
them
from
--
these
are
the
smaller
knives.
he
buys
most
of
them
and
when
i
say
small,
i'm
speaking
relatively.
to
me,
they
look
quite
large.
i
don't
know
if
they
sent
them
up
in
the
exhibit,
but
they
were
placed
in
exhibits
in
the
record,
but
they
are
relatively
smaller
knives
and
they
purchased
most
of
them
at
cost
from
the
company
and
the
company
furnishes
them
the
cost.
i
think
they
cost
around
a
$1.5,
$1.85
a
piece
on
an
average,
but
that
by
the
time
the
employee
puts
all
the
time
into
sharpening
and
i'm
going
to
show
you
sharpening
them,
i
can
assure
you
he
pays
a
lot
more
for
those
knives.
the
--
they
also
sharpen
some
of
the
company
knives,
although
there's
no
requirement
that
they
sharpen
the
company
knives
on
their
own
term
if
there
is
with
respect
to
sharpening.
they're
so-called
--
they're
individual
knives.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
the
company
knives
that,
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
larger
knives
and
the
more
heavy
equipment
so
that
they
all
have
their
individual
knives.
they're
--
they
have
them
and
they
--
they
sharpen
their
own
knives,
and
the
testimony
is
that
they
had
individual
taste
and
they
prefer
to
sharpen
their
own
knives.
they
--
this
is
done
through
use
of
an
emery
wheel
and
wet
stones
and
various
tools
which
the
company
does
furnish
the
tool
room
and
the
tools.
and
the
employees,
although
there
is
evidence
that
the
employees
were
not
required
to
use
the
company
tools
and
room,
the
employees
generally
did
use
it.
most
of
them
did
not
have
that
equipment
for
sharpening
their
own
knives.
theoretically,
too,
the
employees
could
take
their
knives
home
and
sharpen
them.
that
was
a
pure
theory.
it
was
very
rarely
done
and
i
think
there
were
few
occasions
mentioned
where
the
employee
had
some
custom
work
and
he
took
some
knives
home,
but
there
were
very
good
reasons
why
they
wouldn't
take
them
home
from
sharpening.
for
one
thing
the
knives
could
dull.
they
have
their
edges
dull
just
in
the
movement
to
and
from
the
home
to
the
plant.
and
also,
it
was
somewhat
dangerous
to
carry
these
knives
around
away
from
the
plant
and
going
into
traffic.
in
addition
to
that,
as
one
employee
testified,
it
took
--
would
take
as
long
to
wrap
it
up
to
make
it
safe
to
carry
it
as
it
would,
just
stay
and
sharpen
it
almost.
it
wasn't
worth
fooling
with
taking
it
home.
so,
then,
as
a
practical
matter,
they
--
they
could
not
do
this
sharpening
work
at
home.
with
the
requirement
that
the
knives
be
razor
sharp,
it
had
to
be
done
immediately
prior
to
the
--
the
assembly
line
work.
now,
the
tenth
circuit,
i
think,
did
not
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
this
is
an
indispensable
and
integral
part
of
--
of
meat-cutting
work.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
ninth
circuit,
i
beg
your
pardon.
and
i
--
i
don't
understand
that
--
that
respondent
disputes
that.
the
tenth
--
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
was
that
anything
before
the
scheduled
work,
any
activity,
preparatory
activity
before
the
scheduled
workday
or
after
the
scheduled
workday
was
preliminary
--
a
postliminary
within
the
intent
of
section
4.
as
i
have
already
stated
in
--
in
the
argument
of
the
preceding
case,
we
think
the
terms
of
the
statute
despite
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
objections,
as
well
as
the
legislative
history,
plainly
show
that
the
section
4
does
not
make
the
decisive
consideration
whether
it's
pre-shift
or
post-shift.
and
i
will
continue
with
the
legislative
history
because
there
is
much
more
of
that
than
we
could
argue
i
suppose
forever
on
the
--
on
the
terms
of
the
statute
on
its
face,
but
the
legislative
history
where
there
is
more
opportunity
to
--
to
state
the
intent
in
detail
than
there
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute
makes
it
clear
beyond
doubt
that
this
type
of
activity
was
not
intended
to
be
made
non-compensable
whether
it
was
performed
before
the
work
shift
or
after
the
work
shift,
as
well
as
performed
during
the
day.
the
senate
report
gave
two
examples
specifically
of
what
was
intended
by
principal
activities,
and
those
two
examples
we
submit
clearly
indistinguishable
from
the
knife-sharpening
of
the
meat
cutters.
the
first
example
was
the
oiling,
greasing
and
cleaning
of
machine
by
a
lay
operator.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
appears
on
page
14
of
our
brief.
they're
--
they
are
quoted.
those
two
examples
are
quoted,
and
is
"cutting,
installing
a
new
cutting
too"
and
then
the,
“getting
machines
in
readiness
in
operation"
was
the
second
example.
and
the
--
in
giving
those
examples,
senator
cooper
later
pointed
out
in
explaining
that
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
that
those
examples
were
--
showed
very
clearly
that
congress
was
not
excluding
pre-shift
and
post-shift
activity
because
both
of
those
examples
are
obviously
pre-shift
and
--
and
post-shift.
now,
counsel
in
the
steiner
case,
brushed
it
aside,
the
senate
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
reed.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
garment
worker
in
a
textile
mill
who
gets
the
machines
in
readiness.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
well,
she
was
--
well
now
--
and
that,
that's
some
interesting
colloquy
that
followed
there
where
someone
asked
senator
cooper
if
he
had
any
special
reason
for
using
30
minutes.
would
it
make
any
difference
if
it
was
20
minutes,
15
or
5
minuets
and
senator
cooper
said
explicitly,
“no,
i
just
took
the
term
30
minutes
but
the
time
element
has
nothing
to
do
with
it."
that
would
be
the
principal
activity.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
question
is
what
you
mean
by
required.
if
--
if
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
this
--
if
this
--
if
the
evidence
here
shows
that
if
these
knifemen
didn't
have
their
knives
sharpened
and
ready
for
the
production
line,
they
were
fired.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
second
one
is
not
--
obviously,
it's
not
as
close
in
point
as
the
first,
but
subsequently,
senator
barkley
put
almost
this
precise
case
to
--
to
senator
cooper,
and
he
put
the
case
of
the
sharpening
and
preparing
the
tools
which
he,
the
employee
himself
or
his
colleagues
are
--
are
to
use
when
the
factory
opens.
and
he
referred
particularly
to
performing
these
activities
in
the
morning
prior
to
the
scheduled
work
shit,
and
he
asked
explicitly,
“is
that
a
part
of
his
principal
employment
or
is
that
preliminary
or
if
he
is
required
to
do
it
after
the
close
of
the
shop
in
the
afternoon,
is
that
part
of
the
postliminary
work?”
now,
this
colloquy
appears
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
and
to
which
senator
cooper
answered
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
let
me
say
that
on
page
48
of
the
report
of
the
committee,
that
exact
situation,
one
is
merely
comparable
to
it
as
probable
--
as
probably
could
be
cited
if
discussed
and
that's
the
one
of
--
of
sharpening,
cut
--
putting
a
new
cutting
tool
into
the
lathe
machine,
and
under
the
circumstances
that
if
the
intention
of
the
framers
deal
that
such
activity
shall
be
compensable
as
part
of
the
principal
activity.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
exactly
it.
that's
the
one
that
--
that's
the
example
senator
barkley
was
putting.
now,
respondent
thinks
to
minimize
the
effect
of
this
example
by
quoting
from
a
statement
by
senator
barkley
that
followed
which
--
where
he
said
that
he
had
a
strong
--
he
--
he
was
--
might
be
mistaken,
but
he
got
the
strong
impression
from
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
act
and
it
wasn't
the
language
of
mr.
frankfurter
that
is
now
in
the
act
but
some
other
language.
he
got
this
strong
impression
from
the
language
that
--
that
type
of
activity
might
be
considered
a
portal-to-portal
activity
under
the
--
it
was
then
a
definition
of
portal-to-portal
activity
the
act,
in
the
bill.
but
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
senator
cooper
had
unqualifiedly
corrected
senator
barkley,
and
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
senator
barkley
admitted
that
he
hadn't
carefully
analyzed
the
bill
which
obviously
senator
copper
had
done.
in
addition
to
those
two
factors,
the
confusing
definition
of
portal-to-portal
which
--
to
which
senator
barkley
was
referring
when
he
say
he
was
confused,
was
omitted
from
the
act
as
enacted.
and
what's
more
in
the
bill
that
shows
that
definition
was
simply
in
the
--
the
section
2
part
of
the
bill
and
not
in
the
--
latter
part
of
the
bill.
so
that
senator
barkley's
remark
at
that
point
is
wholly
irrelevant
in
--
into
tracks
not
at
all
from
the
meaning
of
principal
activities
as
to
be
related
to
this
precise
example
of
sharpening
tools.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
except
that
senator
barkley
saved
us
that
trouble
by
saying
that
he
--
he
might
well
be
mistaken
and
that
he
be
glad
to
be
corrected
and
senator
cooper
did
correct
him.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
he
called
it
fine
--
a
fine
distinction.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
that's
not
--
that's
not
rare
in
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
--
i
think
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
it's
to
be
expected
in
the
statute
of
this
generality
which
has
--
has
--
applies
to
so
widely
varying
situations.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they're
bound
to
be
some
--
some
part
of
the
question.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
except
that
--
of
course,
we
would
--
we
would
be
glad
to
adopt
that,
the
purposes
of
the
steiner
case.
ms.
bessie
margolin
but
we
--
we
show
--
i
think
that
it
appears
that
if
--
you
can
adopt
that
obviously
because
otherwise
you
get
--
you
get
a
different
result
from
precisely
the
same
facts
where
uniformity
is
important.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
would
say
that
knife-sharpening
is
certainly
every
bit
as
part
of
a
principal
activity
as
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
as
changing
clothes
and
--
and
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
the
hazards
in
the
steiner
case,
and
i
think
they're
different
in
the
result
and
this
is,
of
course,
i
think,
why
we
are
here
in
this
court.
the
differences
in
the
result
is
because
the
court
took,
not
because
they
--
of
the
question
of
whether
it
was
principal
activity
really,
an
integral
part
of
the
work.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
caused
the
difference.
i
think
the
difference
that
caused
by
their
basic
a
legal
approach,
they
--
they
applied
different
legal
criterion.
the
ninth
circuit
assumed
that
any
activity,
any
preparatory
activity
outside
the
scheduled
workday
was
preliminary
and
postliminary
and
i
think
that
is
the
sole
explanation
for
the
difference
in
results
here.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
don't
say
that
all
--
all
preliminary,
all
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
prepared
to
--
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
quite
clear
that
--
that
even
if
this
one
integral
part
and
indispensable
to
the
principal
act
to
the
meat-cutting
job
in
the
production
line
activity,
they
would
--
they
felt
that
it
would
be
preliminary
and
postliminary
because
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it's
true
that
this
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
think
so
many
conflicts
are
inevitable
as
--
as
would
occur,
not
merely
so
many
would
occur
if
this
court
never
would
take
any
of
these
cases.
i
assure
you
your
decision
have
sold
many
--
many
problems
of
course
and
prevented
many
conflicts.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now,
they're
bound
to
be
--
they're
bound
to
be
with
the
varying
facts.
they
are
bound
to
be
of
many
apparent
conflicts.
ms.
bessie
margolin
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
because
they
have
varying
opinions
on
that.
we
always
have
varying
opinions
on
that
and
still
get
them.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
--
the
congress
--
the
congress
has
it
on
the
other
way
on
many
of
what
i
can
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
i
heard
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
i
heard
one
of
the
justices
on
this
court
say
once
that
there
wouldn't
be
much
need
for
lawyers
if
that
wasn't
mostly
our
job,
if
that
job
was
taken
away
from
us.
ms.
bessie
margolin
obviously
--
obviously,
a
great
part
of
--
of
the
work
of
this
court
must
be
to
construe
the
statutes
of
congress
and
the
language
to
use
that
kind.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
he
issues
the
interpretation
and
then
brings
the
acts
to
--
to
enjoin
violation.
ms.
bessie
margolin
he
tries
to
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
he
frequently
will
give
specific
opinions
when
they're
requested.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right
to
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
to
enjoin
violation.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
specific
finding.
there
was
an
investigation
and
they
were
advised
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
the
interpretative
bulletin
specifically
states
that
administrative
view
that
knife-sharpening
time
is
not
preliminary,
postliminary
but
is
compensable
principal
activity.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
undoubtedly,
the
court
have
given
it
great
weight
and
particularly
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
those
are
published
in
the
federal
register
and
can
be
referred
to
as
any
other
legal
authority,
i
assume.
in
addition,
to
the
--
the
rule
of
the
--
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
apply
that
that
carries
great
weight
is
the
fact
that
those
interpretations
have
--
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
or
at
the
time
of
the
1949
amendment
and
congress
did
not
changed
that
particular
interpretation.
and
as
this
court
has
held
in
two
recent
decisions,
this
--
the
general
section
in
the
1949
amendments
keeping
in
effect
any
interpretation
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
the
amendments
that
that
is
in
effect
a
ratification
of
the
interpretations
then
outstanding.
now,
these
interpretations
were
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that.
i
--
i
think
a
regulation
becomes
almost
the
same
as
a
law,
but
i
think
that
those
interpretations
that
were
outstanding
at
the
time
of
the
1949
amendment
and
not
--
and
not
amended
by
virtue
of
the
section
16
(c)
of
that
act
take
on
almost
the
same
effect
as
a
regulation
rule
or
the
statute
itself
were.
ms.
bessie
margolin
on
the
knife
sharpening
time
had
been
the
controversy?
i
don't
believe
we
have
specifically
brought
any
action.
ms.
bessie
margolin
on
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
these
--
some
of
them
--
most
of
them
have
come
up,
i
think
since
before
--
for
lack
of
these
law
has
been
--
regardless,
very
well-settled
prior
to
that
time.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
bessie
margolin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
mr.
johnston's
argument
demonstrate
clearly,
as
it
did
(inaudible)
that
their
position
rests
exclusively
on
the
consideration,
the
time
consideration,
that
is,
that
it
is
prior
after
the
scheduled
workday.
and
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
that
i
reviewed
yesterday
from
senator
cooper
demonstrated
beyond
doubt
that
that
was
not
his
intent
and
he
drafted
the
provision.
but
in
addition
to
senator
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
subcommittee,
the
senate
judiciary
subcommittee
drafted
it.
it
was
composed
of
senators
donnell,
wiley,
and
cooper.
and
senator
donnell,
we
do
not
quote
his
statements
in
the
legislative
history,
i
mean
in
the
--
in
our
brief,
but
his
statement
corroborates
senator
cooper's
views
of
--
of
what
was
intended
by
principal
activity.
the
legislative
history
is
variable
eminently,
and
i
think
even
without
reading
the
report
to
the
legislative
history
and
just
looking
at
the
succession
of
bills
that
the
senate
judiciary
committee
considered
that
it
will
be
apparent
that
the
principle
activities
was
deliberately
selected,
instead
of
the
scheduled
or
contract
work
--
workday.
because
in
the
bill,
which
went
to
hearing,
senate
bill
70,
in
the
bill,
which
went
to
hearing,
precisely
what
mr.
johnston
is
urging
here
was
provided.
that
is
the
preliminary
and
postliminary
activities
were
tied
in
with
the
scheduled
workday,
with
the
contract
workday.
and
senator
donnell
and
i
believe
these
two
citations
with
the
court,
if
i
may,
because
this
confirmed
senator
cooper
conclusively.
senator
donnell
was
explaining
what
happened
to
senate
while
that
provision
was
abandoned
and
principle
activities
was
--
was
adopted,
and
he
explained
that
some
of
the
amalgamated
clothing
company
representatives
and
mr.
(inaudible)
who's
somewhat
of
an
authority
on
this
act,
he
was
very
active
in
--
in
its
original
enactment
and
was
advising
senator
donnell.
he
said,
“mr.
(inaudible)
and
these
union
representatives
had
come
to
him
and
--
and
criticized
that
definition
of
making
it
dependent
on
this
contract
work
--
workday.”
he
had
told
him
that
that
would
operate
to
--
particularly
to
the
disadvantage
of
unorganized
workers
because
it
would
permit
the
employer
to
write
his
own
ticket
as
to
when
he
would
let
the
workday
start
and
end.
that
it
was
particularly
to
the
disadvantage
of
unorganized
workers
and
workers
within
--
in
relatively
weak
union.
and
he
said,
“for
that
reason,
for
that
reason,
if
seven
day
was
resubmitted
and
then
--
and
then
they
came
out
with,
for
the
first
time,
with
a
bill
principle
activities
in
it.”
now,
i
say
that
that
fully
corroborate
senator
cooper's
view
of
what
they
intended
by
--
by
a
principle
activity.
and
by
the
way,
it's
principle
activity
and
activities
in
the
plural.
so,
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
comment,
i
think
something
was
meant
by
that
plural,
and
the
integral
part
of
the
principle
activity
was
intended
to
be
covered
in
that
plural
term
activity.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
now,
i'd
like
to
just
mention
a
few
of
the
facts
about
the
meat
cutting
industry,
i
mean
the
meat
cutting
--
the
knife
sharpening
facts.
it's
not
indispensable
as
mr.
johnston,
what
have
you
think,
simply
because
as
just
as
running
to
work
putting
on
clothes
is
indispensible
to
go
into
any
job.
obviously,
this
is
indispensible
in
--
in
the
sense
that
it's
peculiarly
related
to
this
type
of
meat-to-meat
cutting
work.
just
as
the
clothes
wash,
the
clothes
changing,
and
the
washing
and
the
chemical
battery
plant
--
plant
is
just
not
ordinarily,
just
not
putting
on
clothes
for
an
ordinary
work,
but
because
it
is
required,
necessitated
by
the
peculiar
hazardous
character
of
that
specific
kind
of
work.
now,
that's
the
type
of
integral
principle
activity,
which
senator
cooper
was
obviously
referring
to.
that's
the
type
that
the
examples
in
the
senate
report
referred
to.
that's
what
senator
barkley
was
giving,
senator
mcgrath
was
giving,
and
every
one
of
those
were
prescheduled
workdays,
prscheduled
or
post
schedule
work
day.
they
were
not
activities
carried
on
in
the
scheduled
workday.
and
i
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
pardon
me.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
that
justice
black's
observation
is
--
is
it
points
up
the
deficiency
on
that.
reference
was
made
to
mt.
clemens.
now,
what
the
--
but
it
didn't
say
all
the
activities.
the
mt.
--
the
mt.
clemens
case
involved
a
variety
of
activities,
checking
in,
checking
out,
walking
to
the
workbench,
putting
on
apron.
now,
we
admit
that
the
putting
on
the
apron,
the
checking
in,
checking
--
punching
the
clock
and
--
and
walking
to
the
work
bench,
we
admit
that
those
are
the
incidental
preliminary
type
of
activities
that
were
intended,
but
this
didn't
say
all
of
the
activities
mentioned
in
--
in
--
practically
mentioned
in
--
in
mt.
clemens.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
says
such
as,
such
as.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now,
what
i
say
about
that?
it
says
such
as
and
it
doesn't
say
all.
what
i
say
about
that
is
that
senator
cooper
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
his
colloquies
with
the
congress,
with
the
other
senators
that
--
that
they
didn't
intend
to
include
all
such
things
because
some
of
the
very
example,
to
sharpening
and
some
of
the
very
examples
mentioned
in
mt.
clemens
was
specifically
put
to
senator
cooper
and
he
said,
“we're
not
intending
to
--
to
remove
all
of
those
from
compensation
of
that.”
i
would
like
to
close
with
one,
with
senator
cooper's
summary
of
what
they
intended
to
deal,
which
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
shows
pretty
clearly
that
he
wasn't
saying
that
all
mt.
clemens'
activities
were
to
be
excluded.
he
says,
“in
summarizing
the
provisions
of
the
committee
built
for
the
future,
i
would
like
to
say
again,
that
in
the
period
for
the
scheduled
workday,
the
committee
did
not
legislate,
and
in
that
period,
every
right
which
the
worker
has
secured
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
preserved.
and
second,
second,
in
addition
to
that,
in
our
concept,
in
the
term
principal
activity,
we
believe
it's
sufficiently
broad
to
embrace
within
its
terms
such
activities
that
are
indispensable
to
the
performance
of
productive
work.
third,
we
have
clearly
eliminated
walking,
traveling,
riding,
and
other
activities,
which
are
not
an
integral
part
of
the
employment
for
which
the
work
is
employed.
and
i
shall
repeat
that
instead
of
legislating
against
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
instead
of
attempting
to
destroy
it,
this
is
the
first
legislation,
which
confirms
the
interpretations,
which
have
been
given
by
the
wage
and
hour
administrative
prior
to
this
date.
we
have
simply
setout
standards
and
criteria.”
now,
what
he
was
saying
there
is
except
for
those
few
things
as
to
the
future,
except
for
the
walking,
riding,
and
traveling,
and
the
other
incidental
things
not
a
part
of
integral
--
not
an
integral
part
of
principal
activity,
they
were
confronting
the
previous
administrative
interpretation.
now,
this
was
tocompromise
with
the
house.
the
senate
agreed
that
as
far
as
to
pass
a
cause
of
an
emergency
created
by
mt.
clemens,
they
agreed
to
the
drastic
remedy
of
--
of
denying
liability
for
all
of
those
passed
claims.
but
for
the
future,
for
the
future,
they
intended
to
preserve
pretty
much
what
had
been
held
compensable
prior
to
the
portal
act.
may
i
leave
the
--
two
citations
just
to
bear?
