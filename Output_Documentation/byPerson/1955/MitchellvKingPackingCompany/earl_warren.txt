chief

well,
mr.
johnston,
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
of
the
report
as
quoted
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page

and
following
over
on

in
the

but
the
statement
of
that
just
a
moment,

integral
part
thereof.”
and

it
says,
“the
report
then
provides
two
specific
examples
of
what
is
intended.

in
connection
with
the
operation
of
a
lathe,

employee
will

at
the
commencement
of
his
workday,
oil,
grease
or
clean
his
machine
or
install
a
new
cutting
tool.
such
activities
are
an
integral
part
of
the
principal
activity.”
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
installing
a
new
cutting
tool
from
sharpening
their
knives
with
that

purpose?
