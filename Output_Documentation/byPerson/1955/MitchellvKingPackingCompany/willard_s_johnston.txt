mr.
willard
s.
johnston
if
i
may
speak
to
that
question
so
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
thank
you.
while
we're
on
this
subject,
i
must
disagree
with
ms.
margolin
that
these
controversies
arose
from
the
portal-to-portal
act,
certainly
and
most
specifically
in
so
far
as
the
knife-sharpening
problem
that
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case.
this
problem,
this
whole
problem
arose
under
the
wage
and
hour
act,
the
labor
standards
act
before
the
portal-to-portal
amendment.
and
this
tool
sharpening
problem
was
involved
in
the
mount
clemens
pottery
case,
which
this
court
decided
and
which
was
the
last
of
the
three
cases
under
the
wage
and
hour
law
that
clearly
and
undeniably
resulted
in
portal
act.
and
in
the
mt.
clemens
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
--
that
this
court
made
a
holding
which
makes
it
perfectly
clear
if
we're
going
to
concern
ourselves
with
questions
of
statutory
construction
that
there
is
no
merit
in
the
government's
position
here,
and
that
what
the
government
is
doing
is
seeking
to
ask
this
court
or
is
asking
this
court
to
nullify
the
portal
act.
the
mt.
clemens
case,
if
your
honors
please,
was
concern
with
preliminary
activities
such
as
we
are
concerned
with
here.
it
was
concern
with
both
travelling,
walking
on
the
company's
premises,
and
it
was
concerned
with
preliminary
activities
such
as
the
knife-sharpening,
tool
sharpening.
and
the
question
before
the
court
in
the
mt.
clemens
case
was
whether
all
these
preliminary
activity
compensable
under
the
law
or
not.
and
the
court
didn't
hold
that
it
was
all
compensable.
you
held
only
that
part
of
it,
namely,
that
that
was
necessary
to
the
performance
of
the
employees'
main
job
was
compensable.
well,
it
was
that
holding
that
resulted
in
the
portal
act,
namely,
the
holding
that
only
dispensable,
i
mean
only
indispensable,
only
necessary
preliminary
work
is
required
to
be
compensated
for
under
the
old
wage
and
hour
law.
it
was
that
holding
that
congress
didn't
like
and
that
has
caused
congress
to
enact
this
language,
which
has
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
is
so
clear
in
eliminating
the
compensability
of
any
preliminary
activities.
the
statute
uses
the
word
“any”.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
your
honors
ruled
that
it
was
allowable
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
necessary
activity.
that
it
was
a
necessary
preliminary
work,
but
you
pointed
out
that
any
of
that
preliminary
work
that
was
unnecessary
was
not
compensable
even
under
the
old
law
prior
to
the
portal
act.
in
view
of
that,
the
government
has
no
standing
here
to
claim
that
all
that
the
portal
act
did
was
to
make
not
compensable,
the
unnecessary,
superfluous
travel
time
or
other
preliminary
activities.
you
--
you
pointed
out
particularly
with
reference
to
the
matter
of
travel
time.
there
was
only
the
necessary
travel
time,
the
indispensable
travel
time
that
could
be
compensated
for.
thus,
you
said
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
on
the
property
of
the
employer,
yes,
yes.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
but
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
that's
conceivable
but
when
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
as
you
have
already
pointed
out,
congress
didn't
make
any
qualifications.
in
fact,
not
only
did
congress
not
make
any
qualifications,
but
if
your
honors
please,
congress
specifically
excluded
the
possibility
of
any
qualifications
by
excluding
liability
for
any
of
these
activities,
just
going
through
the
language
of
the
statute
which
is
so
clear
itself.
we
think
there
is
no
room
for
statutory
constructions.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
it
is.
it's
most
necessary
and
most
indispensable.
it's
just
as
indispensable
as
knife-sharpening
that
the
employee
gets
to
the
place
where
he
does
his
work.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
senator
cooper
was
contradicted
immediately
by
senator
barkley.
senator
barkley
said,
"this
isn't
my
impression,"
he
said
and
we've
quoted
the
language
in
our
brief
here.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
senator
cooper
was
for
the
portal
act
and
senator
barkley
was
one
of
those
that
opposed
it
and
he
said,
"i
don't
like
it
because
it's
so
broad."
he
and
the
other
senators
contradicted
and
disagreed
with
senator
cooper.
we've
quoted
the
language
which
senator
barkley
used
on
page
20
of
our
brief
and
he
was
responding
to
senator
cooper.
he
said,
"all
preliminary
and
postliminary
work
required
by
an
employer
in
non-compensable
and
that
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
senator
--
senator
cooper
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
committee,
senator
barkley
was
not.
however,
we
do
not
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
is
--
is
what?
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
it's
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
no.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
senator
cooper
was
mislead.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you.[laughs]
if
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
we're
discussing
the
question
whether
or
not,
the
decision
of
this
court,
one
way
or
the
other,
might
resolve
and
one
or
more
of
the
senators,
having
been
mislead
as
a
result
of
what
occurred
on
the
senate
when
the
portal
act
was
passed.
i
think
that
if
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed,
no
senator
can
fairly
be
said
to
have
been
mislead.
i
will
explain
the
basis
for
that.
i
base
it
in
part
upon
the
statement
in
the
senate
report,
which
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
counsel
for
the
government
in
which
we
have
quoted
at
page
18
of
our
brief
in
which,
the
report,
upon
which
the
senate
acted
specifically
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
make
noncompensable
activities
and
i
quote,
“such
as
the
preliminary
activities
which
were
involved
in
the
mt.
clemens
case.”
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
most
significant.
the
very
kind
of
activities
with
which
this
court
is
concerned
in
this
case
were
involved
in
the
mt.
clemens
case,
tool
sharpening
occurring
preliminary
to
the
regular
work
and
in
its
formal
document
upon
which
it
acted.
the
senate
specifically
said
that
it
intended
by
this
act
to
make
those
activities
non-compensable.
and
i
think
that
that
is
far
more
persuasive
if
we
are
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
than
casual
remarks
made
by
any
of
the
senators
on
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes,
it's
a
--
it
--
that
appears
to
me
to
be
the
case.
it's
--
the
activities
are
to
be
made
non-compensable,
which
are
either
alike
or
similar.
it's
even
broader,
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
black,
than
the
same
as.
it
certainly
includes
those
activities
and
any
others
that
are
like
that.
and
i
think
this
shows
that
the
line
is
certainly
not
to
be
drawn
at
some
point,
farther
than
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
the
mt.
clemens
case,
which
is
what
the
government
is
really
contending
in
this
case.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes.
there,
at
the
bottom
of
page
13,
the
senate
report
emphasizes
that
the
term
“principal
activity”
includes
activities,
which
are
an
integral
part
of
the
principal
activity.
now,
we
agree
with
that,
take
no
issue
with
that.
the
ninth
circuit
took
no
issue
with
that.
but
what
the
government
is
doing
and
what
i
think
senator
cooper
did
was
to,
in
--
in
the
debates
but
it's
not
in
the
report,
i
believe,
use
the
word
"indispensable”
as
synonymous
with
the
word
"integral.”
they
mean
--
they're
two
different
things.
certainly,
they're
overlapping,
but
they
don't
mean
the
same
thing.
something
that's
integral
is
--
is
a
part
of
the
principal
activity,
something
that's
integral
to
the
principal
activity.
but
many
things
may
be
indispensable
to
the
principal
activity
and
yet
not
be
a
part
of
it,
not
be
integral
to
it.
for
example,
it
was
indispensable
that
i
come
from
san
francisco
to
washington
and
make
this
argument,
but
that
trip,
that
travel,
was
no
part
of
this
argument.
there's
a
clear,
obvious
distinction
between
integral
and
indispensable
not
going
on.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes,
i
--
i
think
there
is
a
very
clear
distinction.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
fine,
i
was
coming
to
that.
i
thought
i'd
better
deal
with
the
other
point
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
--
first.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
the
--
they're
speaking
here,
as
i
understand
it,
of
a
machine
tender,
an
--
an
operator
of
a
big
piece
of
machinery,
a
lathe.
this
isn't
a
little
knife
and
this
man's
principal
activity,
this
lathe
operator
is
to
operate
this
lathe
machine.
that's
his
job,
and
whenever
he
does
it,
he's
engaged
in
that
activity.
and
whether
he
--
he
does
it
on
shift
or
off
shift,
he's
operating
that
machine.
that's
his
principal
activity.
it's
just
as
if,
in
our
case,
the
butchers
came
to
work
early
and
did
butchering,
that
would
certainly
be
compensable
as
part
of
their
principal
activity.
but
you
can't
say
that
--
that
the
knifemen
in
our
case
are
--
are
employed
to
10
knives
in
the
sense
that
the
lathe
operator
was
employed
to
attend
the
machine.
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
just
two
wholly
different
things
and
that
they
are
to
be
treated
as
wholly
different
things
as
made
clear
by
the
fact
that
the
senate
report
itself
draws
the
distinction
that
i've
just
mentioned
between
this
example
and
the
other
example
of
the
sharpening
of
tools
that
were
involved
in
the
mt.
clemens
case.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
excuse
me,
what
was
that?
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
if
the
knife
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
it's
--
it's
no
more
his
principal
activity
than
other
incidental
things
that
he
might
have
to
do
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon.
it
was
such
as
going
to
the
restroom
or
whatever
it
might
be
would
be
his
principal
activity.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
oh,
oh,
oh
no,
it
would
be
compensable.
surely,
it
would
be
compensable
under
the
--
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes,
if
it
happened
at
that
time
during
shift
and
he
is
compensated
for
that
too
in
this
case
and
he
is
required
to
be
compensated
under
the
statute
because
the
statute
says,
i
am
looking
at
page
36
of
the
government's
brief
for
the
statute
said
forth,
that
they
are
excluded
from
compensability
activities,
which
are
preliminary
to
the
principal
activity
which
the
employee
is
employed
to
perform.
now,
this
activity
isn't
preliminary
when
it
occurs
during
the
shift.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
if
the
employer
employs
in
the
command
and
the
whistle
blows,
he
goes
to
work
and
the
employer,
in
effect,
says,
“now,
sharpen
your
knife.”
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
then,
there
must
be
some
understanding
either
expressed
or
implied.
if
--
if
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
no.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes.
yes,
other
activities
would
be
compensable
even
outside
of
that
time.
now,
if
the
knife
--
the
sharpening
could
be
a
principal
activity.
it
depends
upon
the
terms
of
employment,
mr.
justice
black.
i
could
be
hired
to
sharpen
knives
and
that
will
be
my
principal
activity,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
i
do
it
during
the
eight
hours
or
whether
the
employer
tells
me
on
some
day
to
come
in
early
and
do
it.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
the
statute
is
clear
on
that.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
certainly.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
certainly.
he
might
get
fired,
but
--
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
i
--
i
can't
quite
agree.
i
think
they
are
time
characterizations
but
there
is
something
more.
we
consider
if
the
employee
came
in
early
and
--
and
butchered.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
he
--
he
was
doing
it
early
wouldn't
mean
that
it
was
a
preliminary
activity.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
exactly,
exactly.
i
think
a
preliminary
has
this
thought
too,
not
only
time,
but
it's
preparatory
to
doing
the
main
job.
it's
--
it's
time,
it's
preliminary
in
time
and
it's
preliminary
in
the
sense
that
it
has
a
relationship
to
the
main
job.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
i
--
i
think
that
in
a
--
in
use
of
the
language,
particularly
in
a
senate
report,
we
may
say
a
thing
in
two
or
three
different
ways,
and
i
don't
think
they
were
saying
that
it
was
something
other
than
the
principal
activity.
but
what
they
were
drawing
attention
to,
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
the
kind
of
thing
in
the
illustration
that
we
were
just
discussing
where
the
machine
tender
comes
in
and
installs
a
new
cutting
tool
or
does
some
oiling
or
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
that
was
an
integral
part
of
his
principal
activity
of
operating
that
machine.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
presumably,
it's
to
handle
the
lathe
completely.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
i
think
this
is
part
of
the
whole
thing.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
i
think
that
it's
a
practical
distinction.
congress
had
to
draw
the
line
at
some
place
and
the
difference
is,
as
i
see
it
that
in
the
lathe
situation,
the
man
is
employed
to
operate
a
machine.
in
our
case,
he
is
an
operator.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
he
isn't
employed
too.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
no.
the
--
the
operation
machine
is
the
whole
thing.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
this
is
a
big
machine
as
contrasted
to
the
little
knife
which
he
handles
and
--
and
he
is
employed
to
kill
and
butcher
cattle.
that's
what
he
is
employed.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
sure,
he
does
it
with
a
knife.
he
does
it
with
the
refrigeration
equipment.
he
does
it
with
the
shroud
that
they
put
over
them.
he
does
it
with
a
lot
of
things,
surely.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
here
is
a
practical
distinction
that
you
have
to
recognize
that
congress
was
drawing
when
it
used
in
the
same
senate
report,
both
as
illustration
of
the
lathe
and
the
illustration
of
the
tool
sharpening,
the
one
being
compensable
and
the
other
being
non-compensable.
now,
i
don't
think
i
have
completed
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
inquiry.
we
come
to
the
next
case.
the
next
illustration
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
--
on
page
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
that's
in
the
report
that's
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
18.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
it
--
it
specifically
excludes
from
compensability
activities,
and
i
quote,
“such
as
the
preliminary
activities
which
were
involved
in
the
mt.
clemens
case.”
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
that
is
in
the
mt.
clemens
case.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
i
assume
that
they
were
--
when
they
knew
it,
they
were
talking
about
when
they
referred
to
the
mt.
clemens
case.
the
mt.
clemens
case
dealt
with
certain
things,
and
--
and
these
things
that
were
involved
in
the
mt.
clemens
case
as
senate
said
are
excluded
from
the
portal
act.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
oh,
that's
right
in
the
opinion.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
right
in
this
court's
opinion,
the
tool
sharpening.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
the
report
incorporates
this
court's
opinion.
the
report
says
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
it
says,
“there
shall
be
not
compensable
activity
such
as
the
preliminary
activities
which
were
involved
in
the
mt.
clemens
case.”
in
the
mt.
clemens
case,
one
of
the
principal
activities
was
sharpening
tools
right
at
page
693.
and
on
the
previous
page,
this
court
made
clear
that
it
was
only
talking
about
necessary
indispensable
sharpening
of
tools
and
other
preliminary
activities.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
yes,
i
am.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
i
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
senator
cooper
or
senator
barkley
specifically
stated
in
the
portion
quoted
that
he
had
read
the
report,
yes
he
did.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
that
he
read
the
report.
now,
whether
he
read
the
opinion,
i'm
sure
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
whether
cooper
had
--
excuse
me,
senator
cooper
had
read
the
opinion.
however,
i
do
think
this.
i
have
reviewed
overnight
senator
cooper's
language
and
what
he
said
and
i
do
think
that
fundamentally,
senator
cooper
was
not
very
far
from
where
we
are
in
this
case
and
couldn't
well
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
may
i
just
point
out
one
other
major
ground
upon
which
i
feel
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
decision
must
be
upheld.
whether
suppose
that
you
disagree
with
me
and
that
you
agree
with
government
that
the
test
is
--
is
indispensability,
whether
it's
indispensable,
that
is
going
to
be
the
test
to
determine
compensability.
assume
that
the
government
is
right
and
that
you
decide
the
government's
right
there,
you
still
have
a
question
of
fact
as
to
what
kind
of
the
indispensability,
not
every
kind
of
indispensability
certainly
is
covered.
the
government
concedes
that
--
that
checking
in
and
waiting
in
line
to
get
to
work
and
travelling
to
work,
that
that
kind
of
indispensability
isn't
enough.
well,
on
an
adequate
factual
showing,
this
court
held
that
we
didn't
have
the
kind
of
a
principal
activity.
they
held
that
there
were
things
that
--
that
made
this
activity.
this
knife
sharpening,
indispensable
only
in
the
sense
in
which
we'll
say
travelling
was
indispensable
or
in
which,
sleeping
or
eating
or
any
of
those
things
that
we
must
do
to
do
our
job
are
indispensable.
in
other
words,
the
court
found
that
this
knife
sharpening
was
not
done
under
the
supervision
of
the
employer.
it
found
that
the
parties
over
a
period
of
20
years
had
treated
it
as
a
non-compensable
and
that
this
was
reflected
and
a
collected
bargaining
agreement
made
between
the
employer
and
the
large
labor
organization
representing
the
employees,
the
amount
made
by
meat
cutters
and
butchers,
workmen
of
north
america.
this
was
the
reality
of
the
industrial
situation
which
ms.
margolin
spoke
of
yesterday
and
she
referred
to
the
administrator's
own
report
in
which
he
said,
“we
must
construe
this
act
in
the
light
of
the
realities
of
the
industrial
situation
and
the
agreements
of
the
parties
where
all
the
realities
here
certainly
requires
that
there'll
be
a
holding
of
non-compensability,
because
those
realities
are,
that
here,
we're
dealing
with
something
that
isn't
supervised
by
the
employer.
it
hasn't
been
treated
by
the
parties
as
compensable.
it's
difficult
to
clark
as
mr.
justice
burton
pointed
out
with
respect
to
this
type
of
thing
in
his
dissent
in
the
mt.
clemens
case.
the
government
offers
no
test
where
as
we
think
we
--
we
offer
a
clearcut
test
as
to
where
to
draw
the
line
here.
you
got
a
concurrent
finding
by
two
lower
courts.
the
two
courts
below
on
this
question
of
fact
and
i
say
that
--
that
their
finding
of
fact
that
it
was
not
a
principal
activity
but
was
a
principal,
but
was
a
preliminary
activity
is
--
should
be
upheld
in
view
of
the
factual
support
it
has
in
the
record
even
under
the
government's
test.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
well,
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
none
to
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
this
time
is
not
treated
separately.
there
are
only
great
employees.
they're
paid
for
the
(voice
overlap),
whistle
to
whistle.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
that's
right
or
admits
--
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
and
of
necessity,
therefore,
this
type
of
thing
was
absorbed
into
the
rate
of
pay
that
was
arrived
at,
which
i
think
is
comparable
to
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
burton
discussed
in
his
dissent
in
the
mt.
clemens
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
may
i
have
a
copy?
mr.
willard
s.
johnston
thank
you.
