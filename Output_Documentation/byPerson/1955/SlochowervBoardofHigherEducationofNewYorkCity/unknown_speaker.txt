unknown
speaker
before
we
get
to
the
constitution
you
spoke
of
a
--
was
it
a
regulation
or
a
statute
that
gave
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
calls
attention
to
them
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
not
to
--
not
in
the
new
york
brief
either,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
[laughs]
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
is
the
--
the
act
that
is
being
--
on
which
what
you
called
punishment
is
vested
on
this
term?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
i'm
directing
my
inquiry,
there's
nothing
that
he
did
so
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concerned
except
the
fact
that
he
happened
to
testify
before
congress
or
committee.
unknown
speaker
it's
purely
a
state
matter
except
as
it
maybe
affected
by
the
federal
constitution
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
the
result
that
happened
to
your
client
was
to
--
a
state
result?
unknown
speaker
which
they
have
used
--
the
state
had
used
as
a
reason
for
a
discharge.
unknown
speaker
i'd
suppose
they'd
say
it
was
the
violation
of
the
federal
--
state
law.
unknown
speaker
i
though
it
said.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
--
you
understand
that
the
states
says
that
that's
evidence
of
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
was
that
argued?
unknown
speaker
or
does
he
have
to
go
as
far
as
to
believe
that
may
lead
to
his
conviction
for
his
prosecution
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
want
--
i
want
to
ask
in
regard
to
the
contention
that
was
made
in
the
petition
that
this
man
has
been
dismissed
without
notice
of
charge
and
opportunity
of
hearing.
what
--
what
become
of
that
allegation?
unknown
speaker
but
under
--
under
section
6206,
i
understand
that
in
other
charges
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
i
understood
that
this
gentleman
had
tenure.
unknown
speaker
under
--
under
this
statute,
you
get
no
hearing
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
first
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
was
under
his
official
--
unknown
speaker
how
--
how
to
--
unknown
speaker
--
determine
that?
unknown
speaker
how
--
how
is
that
determined?
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
no
opportunity
to
--
to
appear.
unknown
speaker
he
is
not
given
a
notice?
unknown
speaker
but
i
--
set
the
point
that
i'm
--
frankly
the
information,
he
wasn't
given
any
opportunity
to
show
--
the
authorities
have
no
connection
with
its
official
duties?
unknown
speaker
but
would
--
unknown
speaker
--
he
have
--
might
have
all
of
these
situations?
unknown
speaker
would
he
had
come
before
the
board
of
higher
education
and
all
of
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
due
process
--
in
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
before
the
board
of
higher
education?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
but
i
don't
understand
why
it
doesn't
have
here
to
establish
whether
or
not
this
was
connected
with
is
official
duties?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
the
specific
statute
has
in
it
to
answer
any
question
regarding
the
property
of
government
or
refers
to
the
city
or
regarding
nominations
or
official
conduct.
or
some
--
some
things
maybe
official
conduct
and
some
are
not
controversial
matter.
unknown
speaker
has
--
has
there
been
any
report
from
the
board
of
education
on
the
number
of
teachers
that
are
admitted
to
communist
affiliations
(inaudible)
--
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
of
any
official
--
it's
more
promulgated
but
i
know
in
my
own
knowledge
that
there
are
substantial
number.
