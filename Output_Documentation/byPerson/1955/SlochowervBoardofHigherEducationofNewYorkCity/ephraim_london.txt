mr.
ephraim
london
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
the
--
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
it
involves
the
constitutionality
of
new
york
city
charter
section
903,
that's
the
same
statute
that
was
considered
by
the
court
in
the
regan
case.
the
court
did
not
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
that
case
or
at
least
the
problems
that
are
here
presented
were
not
presented
in
the
regan
case.
the
question
before
the
court
is
simply
whether
a
state
can
pass
a
law
forbidding
its
employees
to
invoke
a
constitutional
right
in
a
federal
proceeding
or
whether
it
can
pass
a
law
providing
for
the
discharge
of
public
employees
who
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
in
a
federal
proceeding.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
we
have
--
we
have
a
specific
employee,
your
honor,
a
--
mr.
ephraim
london
this
is
one
teacher.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
haven't
raised
the
question
of
academic
freedom
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
on
this
appeal.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
that
the
--
the
statute
provides,
suffice
its
relative
to
the
issues
in
this
case
that
if
any
employee
of
the
city
before
any
legislative
committee
refuses
to
testify
regarding
official
conduct
on
the
ground
that
his
answer
would
tend
to
incriminate
him,
his
term
or
tenure
of
office
would
terminate.
then
the
statute
goes
on
and
say
that
he
shall
not
be
eligible
to
election
or
appointment
but
any
other
office
or
employment
under
the
city
or
any
other
agency.
in
short,
where
the
federal
employee
invokes
his
constitutional
right
in
a
federal
proceeding,
he
is
not
only
dismissed
but
he
cannot
thereafter
hold
city
office
either
elective
or
appointive.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
didn't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
reply
brief
and
that
i
--
i
think
it
completely
answered
it
if
the
one
--
one
short
answer
to
that
is
that
the
court
below
considered
it
to
pass
on
the
question.
mr.
ephraim
london
if
i
may
read,
your
honor,
i'm
reading
now
from
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division
that's
on
the
record
at
page
50
and
the
court
there
says,
"the
charter
provision
does
not
abridge
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination".
now,
going
on
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
minority
opinion,
i'm
reading
now
from
page
61."
all
sides
concede
that
aside
from
the
supposed
applicability
of
section
903,
the
teachers
could
not
be
deprived
of
there
positions
the
exercising
their
fifth
amendment
right
citing
matter
of
grave."
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
that
citation
in
just
a
moment.
now,
going
back
to
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i'm
reading
from
page
56
of
the
record.
the
court
in
discussing
the
opinion
below
said
that
of
the
appellate
division
found
and
now
i'm
quoting,
"that
the
charter
provisions
did
not
abridge
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination."
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
if
your
honor
please,
on
the
--
on
the
questions
that
were
raised
on
the
motion
to
amend
the
remittitur,
i
think
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
city
took
the
position
that
if
these
questions
had
been
passed
upon
by
the
court,
there
was
now
a
necessity
for
the
amendment
of
the
remittitur.
and
i
believe
the
court
adopted
that
position.
i
think
it
was
perfectly
correct,
if
i
may
say,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
before
the
court,
i
oppose
the
--
or
i
was
--
i
advise
against
the
making
of
a
motion
to
amend
the
remittitur
because
i
thought
that
the
record
was
quite
clear.
if
i
may
proceed
with
the
argument
or
rather
what
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
before
september
1952,
professor
slochower
had
been
a
teacher
or
professor
of
literature
and
of
german
at
brooklyn
college.
he
had
been
teaching
there
for
some
27
years.
in
september
of
1952,
he
was
called
before
united
states
senate
subcommittee.
the
subcommittee
was
investigating
the
internal
security
act
and
at
the
very
outset,
senator
ferguson,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
made
it
clear
that
he
was
not
investigating
the
public
educational
system
but
only
the
internal
security
problems
that
affected
the
nation.
there
was
some
later
qualification
of
that
statement
by
another
member
of
the
committee
but
i
think
that
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman
stood
as
the
purpose
of
the
--
as
the
purpose
of
the
hearing.
dr.
slochower
came
before
the
senate
subcommittee
and
testified
freely
on
the
question
of
present
membership
in
the
communist
party,
even
not
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
the
inquiry.
he
stated,
he
had
not
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
the
years
following
1941.
he
invoked
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
only
with
respect
to
questions
relating
to
the
years
1940
and
1941.
he
said
he
would
answer
any
other
question
that
the
committee
asked
and
he
did.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
court
will
recall
that
dr.
slochower
was
being
questioned
by
the
senate
subcommittee
when
the
court
recess
--
yesterday
afternoon
that
he
had
testified
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
he
had
not
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
the
years
after
1941
and
refused
on
the
grounds
that
his
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
to
state
whether
he
was
a
member
in
1940
or
in
1941.
dr.
slochower
stated
further
that
he
had
expressed
himself,
i
believe,
publically
in
opposition
to
some
communist
doctrines.
two
weeks
after
the
hearing,
dr.
slochower
received
a
notice
from
the
board
of
higher
education
which
governs
the
college
in
which
he
work
that
by
resolution
he
was
dismissed.
he
had
been
working
for
the
city
system
as
an
instructor
and
a
college
professor,
i
assume
27
years.
he
had
tenure
by
statute.
i
think
counsel
for
the
appellee
will
concede
that
had
dr.slochower
been
guilty
of
any
other
wrong
doing,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
notice.
had
he
perjured
himself
to
use
a
specific
instance
given
by
the
corporation
counsel?
had
he
contumaciously
refuse
to
answer
questions?
had
he
been
guilty
of
arson,
seducing
a
student
or
stealing
money
from
the
college,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
he
could
be
discharged.
but
once
he
invoked
the
constitutional
right,
he
lost
his
right
to
a
hearing.
he
lost
his
right
to
notice.
he
lost
all
of
the
rights
guaranteed
him
by
the
statute
and
the
elaborate
procedures
that
have
been
formulated
for
discharge
of
professors
by
the
board
of
higher
education.
i
shall
return
to
that
question
later,
the
question
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
he
had
been
entitled
to
a
--
to
a
hearing
under
new
york
laws
and
being
deprived
to
that,
he
was
deprived
of
due
process.
i
think
that
in
any
event,
in
view
of
that
fact
that
the
statute
determined
the
status
namely,
that
he
was
ineligible
for
future
employment,
he
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
due
process
requirements.
mr.
ephraim
london
not
specifically
under
903
and
the
courts
have
--
have
decided
that
section
903
is
automatic.
i
don't
quite
understand
what
that
means
but
it
is
in
the
language
of
the
court,
automatic.
the
section
is
theoretically
triggered
into
action
by
someone's
invoking
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor
the
statute
says
that
he
must
invoke
the
you
honor,
in
connection
with
conduct
of
his
office
but
that's
been
so
broadly
interpreted,
that
i
now
believe,
that
it
means
practically
any
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
particularly,
if
we
adopt
the
arguments
of
the
corporation
counsel
on
which
i
shall
also
referred
too
later.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
that's
the
interpretation
that's
given
by
the
court
or
rather
that's
the
--
that's
the
actual
effect.
if
i
may
anticipate
my
argument,
corporation
counsel
has
stated
that
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
kind
of
dishonorable
thing,
well
then
it
would
flow,
i
think,
if
would
naturally
follow
that
anybody
who
invoked
it
was
dishonorable
and
shouldn't
be
employed
in
the
public
employ
--
in
the
public
civil
service.
mr.
ephraim
london
a
hearing
is
necessary.
he
would
have
to
have
a
hearing
before
he
could
be
discharged.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
--
i
would
say
this
your
honor
that
you're
opposing
two
different
problems.
one
is
the
problem
of
a
hearing
before
the
board
of
regents
or
the
board
of
higher
education
--
i've
forgotten
just
which
conducts
the
hearing
and
the
other
is
a
trial
in
which
one
is
convicted
of
a
crime.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor
mr.
ephraim
london
i
believe
that's
true.
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i'm
just
trying
to
emphasize
what
i
think
the
weakness
of
the
corporation
counsel's
office.
i
think
it's
completely
unreasonable
for
the
corporation
counsel
to
argue
as
he
has.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
a
logical
point
i
was
making.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
precisely.
mr.
ephraim
london
precisely.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
advice,
your
honor,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
ephraim
london
is
that
there
is
not
hearing
and
that
the
man
has
been
ajudged
ineligible
for
future
employment.
to
--
to
illustrate
how
unfair
the
--
the
operation
of
this
particular
statute
i
merely
pointed
out
that
in
other
more
heinous
offenses
to
use,
your
honors
language,
one
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
when
is
entitled
to
--
to
a
discussion
before
the
board,
before
he
can
be
discharged.
mr.
ephraim
london
no.
but
due
process,
your
honor,
“is
essentially
in
incorporation
of
the
principles
of
fairness
and
equity.”
i
think
i'm
quoting,
your
honor
when
they
say
that.
mr.
ephraim
london
my
constitution
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
constitutional
argument.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
believe
that
there
are
both,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
statute
in
the
educational
law
providing
for
hearing.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
think
i
have,
your
honor,
but
if
--
if
i
may
add
to
the
argument,
i
think,
i
can
find
it
very
short
order.
in
fact,
my
(voice
overlap)
section
6206.
mr.
ephraim
london
section
6206
--
mr.
ephraim
london
thank
you
very
much.
it's
section
6206
(10)
of
the
new
york
education
law
and
pursuant
to
that
section,
the
board
of
--
of
higher
education
or
the
board
of
regents
has
promulgated
regulations
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
hearings.
they're
rather
elaborate
regulations
and
they
were
not
attached
to
the
--
to
the
briefs
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
below.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
part
of
the
record
of
the
--
at
all.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
they
make
no
reference
to
section
903.
at
least
they
didn't
at
the
time
this
--
this
case
came
up.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
claim
that
he
--
that
he
has
had
a
privilege
abridged
in
violation
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
i
also
claim
that
he
has
been
denied
due
process.
these
are
two
separate
arguments
that
i
should
like
to
treat
separately
if
i
may.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
have
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
there
was
some
disagreement
in
the
court
as
to
whether
equal
protection
or
i
would
apply
or
not
and
i
have
treated
this
as
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
because
i
think
it
clearly
is
as
abridgement
of
an
immunity.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
could
be.
mr.
ephraim
london
if
the
court
should
wish
to
adopt
that
argument,
i
shall
have
no
complain.
mr.
ephraim
london
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
was
invoked
at
the
very
outset.
it's
in
the
petition
and
i
think
i
can
call
your
attention
to
the
--
to
the
precise
section.
i
believe
at
page,
it
says
that
the
petitioner
was
deprived
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
have
been
the
--
the
argument
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
raised
that
too.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statutes
offense
against
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
the
section
provides
for
the
dismissal
of
an
employee,
a
state
employee
or
city
employee
rather
who
invokes
the
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination.
i
don't
believe
the
word
constitutional
is
in
section
903
but
anyone
who
invokes
the
right
to
refuse
to
incriminate
himself
is
under
the
statute
to
be
discharged.
before
this
section
was
enacted
in
1938,
the
new
york
constitution
read
exactly
as
the
federal
constitutional
provision
with
respect
to
self-incrimination.
the
exact
language
as,
your
honors
are
familiar
is,
"nor
shall
he
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself."
that
was
the
new
york
statute
before
1938.
now,
in
1938
--
that
was
the
new
york
constitution,
i'm
sorry.
in
1938,
the
new
york
constitution
was
amended
to
validate
such
a
law
as
section
903.
the
new
york
constitution
now
provides,
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
providing
that
any
public
officer
upon
being
called
before
a
grand
jury,
refuses
to
answer
any
relevant
questions.i'm
just
reading
the
relevant
portion.
relevant
question
concerning
his
office
should
be
removed
from
office
by
the
appropriate
authority
and
shall
forfeit
his
office
at
the
suit
of
the
attorney
general.
now,
without
that
change
in
the
new
york
constitution,
section
903
would
have
been
unconstitutional
under
the
laws
of
the
--
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
think
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
held,
one
who
invokes
the
state
constitutional
right
may
properly
be
discharged
under
section
903.
but
the
amendment
of
the
state
constitution
can
certainly
not
affect
the
federal
constitutional
right
and
it
was
the
federal
constitutional
right
that
was
invoked
in
this
case.
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
about
it.
it
was
specifically
referred
to
in
the
hearings
as
the
fifth
amendment
right
and
it
was
before
a
federal
body,
a
senate
subcommittee,
the
committee
on
the
judiciary.
so,
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
it
was
a
federal
right,
in
a
federal
proceeding
that
was
here
invoked
and
because
of
the
invocation
of
that
right,
the
appellant,
slochower
was
discharged.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
section
903
doesn't
really
inhibit
the
right
against
self
--
self-incrimination
that
just
imposes
a
condition
on
public
employment.
i
think
the
argument
is
a
spacious
one.
i
think
that
merely
because
the
section
does
not
say
we
forbid
public
employees
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
that
it
doesn't
have
that
effect.
it
obviously,
does
have
that
effect
because
it
is
followed
by
a
penal
consequence
namely,
discharge.
now,
i
think,
i'll
call
your
attention
of
the
fact
in
--
in
my
brief
that
most
of
the
penal
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
i
believe
the
same
is
true
with
the
federal
laws,
do
not
forbid
any
particular
act.
they
provide
that
an
act
shall
be
punished
in
a
particular
manner,
the
fact
that
that
is
merely
the
provision
--
that
the
provision
is
merely
want
for
punishment
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
doesn't
forbid
the
act.
and
so,
in
this
case
the
state
of
new
york
in
effect
forbids
its
employees
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
on
paying
of
discharge
from
their
positions.
i
think
there's
also
a
line
of
cases
to
which
i
have
called
the
attention
to
the
effect
that
a
state
cannot
impose
an
unconstitutional
condition
on
a
privilege
that
it
is
granting
the
unconstitutional
condition
in
this
case,
being
the
condition
that
one
must
surrender
his
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
the
section
between
the
case
that
we
have
and
the
case
where
a
federal
employee
might
be
discharged
for
invoking
the
fifth
amendment,
is
very
great
because
in
our
case,
the
case
that
we
have
now,
a
state
employee
is
in
effect
being
told
that
he
may
not
invoke
certain
rights
in
a
purely
federal
proceeding
in
a
matter
over
which
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
it
think
that
the
regulation
is
in
effect
an
invasion
on
the
sphere
reserve
for
--
for
federal
action.
the
distinction,
i
believe,
your
honor
was
made
in
--
in
the
mitchell
case
in
that
case
the
--
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
a
federal
employee
in
being
denied
the
right
to
engage
in
certain
political
activities
was
being
deprived
of
state
right.
and
the
court
found,
i
believe
it's
on
page
96
of
the
opinion
that
the
state
rights
were
not
being
violated.
and
so,
in
this
case,
i
think,
you
will
have
a
different
question
of
purely
state
right
was
being
affected
by
section
903,
as
it
is
a
federal
right
was
being
affected
and
i
think
the
distinction
is
important.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
act
in
this
specific
case
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
--
if
that
were
true,
the
senate
subcommittee
would
have
been
entirely
--
would
have
been
trespassing
in
an
area
where
it
had
no
right
to
trespass.
the
senate
subcommittee
had
no
right
to
--
to
investigate
the
education
in
the
state
of
new
york.
what
it
was
investigating
as
it
--
as
the
chairman
stated
was
the
--
was
the
violation
of
the
internal
security
act
or
rather
the
enforcement
of
the
internal
security
act
was
purely
federal
question.
mr.
ephraim
london
precisely.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
reason
for
the
discharge
was
not
his
wrong
doing.
the
reason
for
the
discharge
was
his
violation
rather
his
invocation
of
the
constitutional
right.
i
--
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that.
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor
--
mr.
ephraim
london
it's
--
it's
just
the
state
law
that
we
claim
offense
against
the
constitution
because
it
says
you
may
not
invoke
the
federal
right.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
--
this
one
federal
right.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
--
this
refers
only
to
the
right
against
self-incrimination
and
it's
only
by
the
interpretation
in
this
case
that
we
must
hold
that
the
statute
means
that
it
--
that
it
invokes
it
--
it
imposes
a
penalty
in
the
event
the
federal
right
against
self-incrimination
is
imposed,
is
invoked.
that
is
now
the
meaning
of
the
statute
as
the
--
as
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
new
york
and
we
must
accept
that
as
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
but
in
answer
to
justice
reed's
question
i
--
i
like
to
emphasize
that
no
one
has
accused
dr.
slochower
of
any
wrong
doing.
it
hasn't
been
suggested
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
it
isn't
suggested
that
he
has
--
is
incompetent.
it
isn't
suggested
that
he
isn't
fit
for
his
job,
on
the
contrary,
i
think,
he
has
been
recognized
as
the
one
of
the
most
competent
and
eminent
members
of
the
--
of
the
school
staff.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
it
would
have
been
a
quite
different
position.
because
had
he
been
in
the
state
court
or
before
a
state
body,
the
right
that
he
would
have
invoked
would
have
been
his
state
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination.
if
the
court
--
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
under
the
twining
--
under
the
twining
and
adamson
cases,
i
think,
that
when
he
is
the
state
court
and
he
invokes
his
right
against
self-incrimination
he
is
not
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
right.
i
--
i
think
there's
some
question
is
to
wether
or
not
the
court
would
adhere
to
that
decision
today
but
that
is
the
--
the
court's
holding.
mr.
ephraim
london
we
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
i
--
i
shall
come
to
the
due
process
question
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
very
shortly.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
--
i
have
by
the
way
divided
the
argument
into
the
two
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
ephraim
london
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
and
i've
also
--
i've
also
argued
that
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
--
of
the
area
reserved
to
the
federal
government,
namely
the
regulation
of
its
own
proceedings
before
a
federal
body.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
was
implicit,
your
honor,
in
the
--
in
the
entire
brief.
they
--
a
question
with
which
we
--
mr.
ephraim
london
if
your
honor
please.
i
--
i
mentioned
yesterday
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question,
the
argument
that
was
raised
by
corporation
counsel
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
remittitur
which
was
as
follows
and
i
read
now
from
page
5
of
the
appellee's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
apparent
from
the
forgoing
discussion
that
if
this
court
finds
that
a
question
of
federal
constitutionality
was
properly
presented,
the
alternative
relief
of
reargument
sought
by
a
petitioner
is
unnecessary
and
his
argument
was
that
there
was
no
point
if
this
questions
have
been
properly
presented
and
passed
upon
by
the
court,
in
the
court's
amending
the
remittitur
or
granting
reargument
in
that
respect
and,
i
think,
the
corporation
counsel
was
entirely
right.
i
think
the
court
had
passed
on
the
question.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i'm
going
further
in
saying
that
the
court
specifically
passed
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
your
honor
and
i
disagree
on
the
significance
of
the
silence.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
do
add
if
i
may,
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
repeat
whether
it
had
said
before
in
its
opinion.
mr.
ephraim
london
i'm
--
i'm
referring
to
--
to
the
following.
mr.
ephraim
london
page
56
of
the
record
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
in
which
the
court
in
discussing
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
says
as
follows
and
that
the
charter
provisions
do
not
abridge
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it
was
referring
to
an
argument
below
in
the
appellate
division.
if
that
argument
was
properly
raised
in
the
appellate
division,
i
think,
under
the
bryant
case,
it's
properly
before
this
court.
i
go
further
now
and
refer
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
desmond
or
judge
desmond
rather
in
which
he
says
that,
“all
sides
can
see,”
that
aside
from
the
supposed
applicability
of
section
903,
the
teachers
could
not
deprived
with
their
possessions
for
exercising
their
fifth
amendment
right.
he
is
speaking
of
the
fifth
amendment
right.
this
is
the
basic
question.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
i
had
just
mentioned
that
before.
mr.
ephraim
london
because
judge
desmond
says
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ephraim
london
judge
desmond
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
but
he
tells
you
what
the
argument
was,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
it's
regrettable,
your
honor,
that
they
didn't.
but
apart
from
that
question,
i
think,
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
have
raised
the
fifth
amendment
question
below
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
it
was.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
constitutional
provisions
had
to
be
relied
on.
now,
i'm
talking
--
i
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
stated
yesterday
that
--
that
i
--
i
thought
that
the
motion
for
remittitur
--
for
the
amendment
of
a
remittitur
was
ill
advised.
i'm
more
convinced
to
it
now,
your
honor.
[laughter]
now,
in
considering
the
--
the
question
of
--
of
whether
the
statute
under
consideration
violates
article
6
of
the
constitution
and
violates
the
--
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
the
question
of
reasonableness
does
not
enter
into
the
discussion
whether
or
not
the
law
is
a
wise
one,
whether
or
not
the
law
is
a
reasonable
one,
if
it
invades
an
area
reserved
to
the
federal
government
or
if
it
violates
or
abridges
a
privilege
granted
by
the
constitution
then
the
law
must
fall
whether
reasonable
or
no.
in
the
--
in
our
argument
relating
to
the
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
we
must
answer
the
question
of
reasonableness
because
this,
it
is
claimed
that
the
statute
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
is
arbitrary
and
it
is
unreasonable.
and
it
is
arbitrary
and
it
is
unreasonable
because
it
limits
a
federal
constitutional
right
and
it's
claimed,
the
appellant
submits
that
that
right
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
fitness
for
employment
or
with
his
right
to
work
for
the
public
school
system.
now,
the
appellee
has
argued
that
the
invocation
of
the
right
is
a
matter
relating
to
a
teacher's
employment
because
there's
something
dishonorable
or
indecent
about
refusing
to
answer
question
on
the
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
to
use
the
precise
argument
that
the
board
has
used
in
this
court,
they
say
that
either
the
invocation
of
the
right
tends
to
show
that
a
man
is
guilty
or
that
the
one
who
invokes
the
right
is
a
perjurer.
in
either
case,
he
is
immediately
branded
and
stamped
as
being
guilty
of
wrong
doing
the
moment
he
invokes
his
federal
constitutional
right.
now,
this
court
has
repeatedly
asserted
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
is
one
of
the
board's
freedom
that
it's
a
privilege
of
great
value,
“the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
the
quinn
case.”
this
privilege
of
great
value
would
be
worth
nothing
if
the
moment
one
invokes
it,
he
is
immediately
assumed
to
be
guilty
of
the
crime
about
which
his
questioned
or
he's
assumed
to
be
perjurer
or
one
or
the
other.
it
would
virtually
nullify
the
act
completely,
both
nullify
the
amendment
completely.
and
if
i
can
use
a
--
a
much
abused
and
misused
term,
i
think,
that
that
argument
is
subversive
of
the
constitution
because
it
eliminates
the
provision
completely.
one
wouldn't
dare
to
exercise
the
constitutional
right
if
these
were
the
inferences
to
be
drawn.
mr.
ephraim
london
not
if
it
--
not
if
it
tendered
to
show
that
you
are
guilty.
if
one
were
to
assume
that
you
are
guilty
and
you
are
being
prosecuted.
this
would
be
the
strongest
evidence
against
you,
your
honor,
if
you
invoked
the
fifth
amendment.
this
same
argument
if
made
in
a
criminal
prosecution
would
destroy
the
defense.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
i
used
their
language
that
it
would
tend
to
show
--
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
if
it
would
tend
to
show
it,
your
honor.
if
that's
the
inference
to
be
drawn.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
disastrous
in
a
--
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
with
their
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
in
law
we
can
distinguish
between
the
legal
effect
and
the
public
attitude.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
court
please.
i'd
like
to
correct
the
statement
by
my
friend
mr.
scannell
with
reference
to
the
garner
case
and
i
think
it's
rather
crucial.
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
garner
case
permitted
questioning
with
respect
to
any
prior
period.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
case
related
to
a
statute
which
provided
that
the
--
the
employees
of
the
city
would
have
to
swear
that
within
five
years
prior
to
the
effect
of
date
of
the
law,
they
have
not
advise
or
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
it
was
limited
to
the
five-year
period.
now,
that
inquiry
was
held
relevant
because
of
a
charter
provision
that
had
been
passed
some
seven
years
before,
which
made
that
inquiry,
an
appropriate
inquiry
in
connection
with
government
office.
so
that
the
garner
case
didn't
really
relate
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
beg
to
differ
with,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
believe
that
it
says
within
five
years
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
law.
i
maybe
mistaken,
but
i
believe
that's
correct
and
i
believe
that
this
court
specifically
--
mr.
ephraim
london
this
court
specifically
limited
its
--
its
determination
or
referred
in
its
determination
to
the
fact
that
there
have
been,
a
1941
charter
amendment.
mr.
ephraim
london
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes.
in
addition
--
in
addition
in
the
garner
case,
in
connection
with
the
--
in
connection
with
the
statement.
it
was
assumed
by
the
court
that
the
statement
had
to
be
--
that
the
--
the
statement
meant
that
one
with
knowledge
had
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
or
has
belong
to
an
organization
which
had
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
in
so
it
was
the
material
and
most
important
factor
as
the
court
later
noted
in
the
wieman
case.
now,
there
is
another
tremendously
important
difference
between
the
garner
case
and
this
one.
and
that
the
garner
case
related
to
a
state
inquiry
with
respect
to
a
state
matter
pursuant
to
a
state
charter
amendment.
i
think
the
difference
between
that
case
and
the
case
at
bar
is
probably
most
dramatically
illustrated
by
a
companion
case
to
the
garner
case,
the
durand
case.
now,
before
the
durand
case
came
up
there
had
been
a
prior
action.
there
were
several
people
in
the
state
of
maryland
including
thelma
durand
who
were
running
for
office.
the
state
of
maryland
required
that
those
people
state
under
oath
that
all
people
running
for
office
state
under
oath
that
they
have
not
been
members
of
organization
which
where
deemed
subversive,
something
to
that
effect.
now,
thelma
durand
and
the
first
of
the
cases,
was
running
for
federal
government
office,
i
believe
for
congress.
the
state
of
maryland
held
that
that
statute
did
not
apply
to
her
but
applied
to
the
other
defendants
or
rather
the
other
petitioners,
i'm
sorry,
who
were
running
for
state
office
alone
because
have
that
application
been
made
in
connection
with
federal
office
it
would
have
been
an
invasion
of
the
federal
sphere
of
action
or
an
area
reserved
for
the
federal
domination.
later
when
the
durand
case
came
up
before
this
court,
the
second
durand
case,
it
was
case
where
thelma
durand
was
then
running
for
state
office
and
the
court
held
that
she
could,
that
--
that
the
state
of
maryland
could
pass
regulations
controlling
state
office.
so
here,
we
have
statute
which
interferes
with
a
federal
proceeding
or
with
the
government
of
federal
proceedings.
and
therefore,
in
that
connection
the
question
of
reasonableness
does
not
enter
but
i
want
to
answer
my
friend's
argument
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
statute.
in
considering
its
reasonableness,
we
may
consider
several
factors
(1)
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
(2)
the
alternative
methods
and
(3)
the
application
to
the
particular
case.
now,
with
respect
to
purpose,
my
friend
says
it
is
to
compel
cooperation
with
inquiry
relating
to
office.
well
now,
the
--
the
state
government
is
certainly
not
without
power
to
compel
cooperation,
it
doesn't
need
--
this
means,
namely
the
deprivation
or
the
limitation
of
the
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination
in
point
of
fact,
there
have
been
several
later
cases
where
teachers
declined
to
answer
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party
and
they
were
removed
by
the
state
of
new
york
not
because
of
the
violation
of
section
903
but
after
hearings,
in
which
it
was
determined
that
they
had
failed
to
cooperate.
i
think
that
the
--
the
best
answer
to
the
argument
of
the
appellee
has
made
is
justice
roberts
in
the
schneider
case
in
which
he
said,
“that
if
one
wants
to
prevent
littering
in
the
streets,
it's
not
necessary
to
limit
the
right
of
public
assembly
to
merely
pass
a
law
preventing
the
littering
or
forbidding
or
punishing
the
littering
of
the
streets.”
in
this
case,
if
they
want
to
root
out
communist
in
the
public
school
system,
they
have
a
perfect
means
of
doing
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
found
that
means
in
the
feinberg
law
which
this
court
upheld.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
passed
before,
your
honor,
that
became
effective
afterwards.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
application
of
this
particular
case,
i
think,
the
court
has
emphasized
in
its
questions,
the
fact
that
this
relates
to
a
period
some
12
or
13
years
prior
to
the
inquiry.
it
couldn't
possibly
have
any
--
any
connection
with
the
teacher's
confidence
or
ability
to
teach
and
there
was
no
claim
at
any
time
that
this
question
related
to
his
own
confidence
and
fitness
as
a
teacher.
thank
you.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
am
about
to
do
that.
i
wanted
to
retain
it
until
the
brief.
i
wanted
to
retain
that,
your
honor,
until
the
argument
--
mr.
ephraim
london
mr.
scannell
would
be
able
to
answer
that.
i
am
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
thank
you,
sir.
