mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
address
myself
to
the
procedural
point
in
our
brief
but
i
do
not
wish
to
conceive
that
we
do
not
argue
in
our
brief
that
the
point
made
by
mr.
london
that
this
903
section
is
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
that
it
abridges
a
federally
given
right.
we
made
that
in
our
brief
and
i
will
meet
that
later
on
the
argument.
unfortunately,
however,
that
point
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
point
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
invoking
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
a
federal
proceeding
and
the
subsequent
dismissal
under
a
state
statute
for
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
for
refusing
to
answer
a
question
into
official
conduct
that
that
violated
that
portion
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
states,
“that
no
state
may
make
or
enforce
a
law
which
abridges
a
privilege
or
immunity
given
to
a
citizen
of
the
united
states."
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it
was
not
argued.
i
will
proceed
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
not.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
purpose
for
which
he
raised
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
court
of
appeal
--
well
actually
he
did
raise
it
at
all.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
only
argument
he
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
it
deprived
him
of
the
due
process
to
which
he
was
entitled
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
he
had
no
trial,
because
he
had
no
hearing.
he
didn't
have
compensation
of
witnesses.
he
didn't
have
the
right
to
cross-examine.
that's
his
whole
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
appellate
division,
a
citation
in
the
opinion
of
that
court
in
which
he
relies.
in
the
appellate
division,
he
made
no
reference
to
any
federal
right
or
any
constitutional
right
so
that
when
he
states
in
his
reply
brief,
at
page
--
referring
to
page
50
of
the
record
that
the
charter
provision
does
not
abridge
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
what
the
appellate
division
is
referring
to
there,
is
this
argument
made
by
the
appellant.
i
read
from
this
point
heading,
point
two,
section
903
of
the
new
york
charter
is
an
unconstitutional
abridgement
of
rights
guaranteed
by
article
1,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution.
the
section
is
void
and
have
no
effect
and
it
cannot
be
held
to
sanction
the
appellants
dismissal.
that's
what
the
appellate
division
was
talking
about
at
page
50
of
the
record,
when
it
said
that
they
found
no
conflict
between
section
903
and
the
new
york
state
constitution.
similarly,
he
refers
the
court
to
page
56
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
contain
that
the
--
page
56
in
the
record
where
all
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing
was
paraphrasing
what
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
was.
and
it
stated
there
that
the
appellate
division
found
that
there
was
no
abridgement
of
the
constitutional
right
referring
to
the
new
york
state
constitution.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
what
judge
desmond
meant
there
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
if
903
weren't
on
the
statute
books
of
new
york
state,
this
teacher
could
not
be
dismissed
because
if
you
will
see
he
refers
to
matter
of
gray.
in
the
gray
case,
it
involved
a
lawyer
in
staten
island
who
was
accused
of
(inaudible)
chasing
and
he
was
asked
to
execute
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
going
before
the
court.
and
he
stated
i
will
exercise
such
a
waiver,
but
when
i
go
before
the
court,
i'll
make
full
disclosure
about
all
my
books
etcetera.
but
he
refused
to
sign
the
waiver.
he
was
brought
up
for
purposes
of
disbarment
to
determine
whether
he
was
contemptuous
of
the
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
he
was
protected
by
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
he
may
invoke
the
privilege.
so
that
all
judge
desmond
was
talking
about,
is
that
in
view
of
that
gray
decision,
if
there
was
not
an
act
by
the
legislature
such
as
section
903,
this
teacher
could
not
be
dismissed
for
invoking
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
all
judge
desmond
was
talking
about.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
your
honor,
i've
gone
through
the
appellate
division
of
the
court
of
appeals
brief
of
this
appellant
from
one
page,
from
the
front
page
to
the
back.
and
the
only
reference
that
i
find
to
any
federal
question
is
when
he
argues
that
the
appellant,
slochower,
was
deprived
of
property
rights
without
due
process
in
violation
of
article
1,
section
10
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
clear
import
of
the
argument
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
far
as
the
due
process
part
is
concerned.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
is
my
argument,
judge
frankfurter.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
yes,
but
his
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
would
say
this,
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
question
was
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it
means
that
he's
complaining
the
he
had
no
trial,
that
there
was
a
tenuous
section
and
that
under
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
but
his
quarrel
is
with
procedure,
not
with
the
substance
in
the
statute.
he
never
addressed
an
argument
to
the
substance
in
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
appellant
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
on
the
line
of
the
--
his
fifth
amendment
rights
being
violated.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
to
outline
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
if
the
language
was
absolutely
clear,
there
would
be
no
question
that
your
position
is
correct,
well
it's
correct
anyhow.
but
when
there
is
some
doubt
in
you
mind
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
sent
to
you
for
review.
i
think
it
is
pertinent
to
understand
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
might
have
been
if
the
petitioner
has
gone
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
them
to
rephrase
the
question
if
they
would
as
he
now
puts
it.
your
honor,
i
was
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
sorry
for
the
reply
brief
yesterday
and
certain
points
were
raised
in
the
reply
brief,
which
i
have
answered
orally
but
i
would
like
permission
to
submit
an
explanation
to
his
reply
brief.
i
could
have
it
by
next
monday,
i
think.
the
section
we
have
here
under
examination
namely,
903
of
the
new
york
city
charter
has
for
its
purpose
the
assurance
that
employees
of
the
city
of
new
york
will
give
their
full
cooperation
to
any
properly
constituted
investigating
committee
that
makes
inquiry
either
to
the
affairs
or
government
of
the
city
of
new
york
or
inquiry
into
the
official
conduct
of
one
of
the
employees
of
the
city
of
new
york.
now,
the
purpose
in
providing
that
no
employee
called
to
testify
under
those
circumstances
and
in
answer
to
questions
along
that
line.
the
purpose
in
precluding
him
from
continuing
as
an
employee
and
pleading
self-incrimination
seems
to
me
rather
obvious.
if
the
employee
point-blankly
refuses
to
testify,
he
is
of
course
subject
to
contempt
action
by
the
investigating
body,
as
well
as
dismissal
by
the
employee
--
employer.
similarly,
if
he
testifies
falsely,
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
perjury.
but
when
the
employee
invokes
the
fifth
amendment,
he
is
effectively
(inaudible)
that
committee.
the
committee
can
go
no
further
with
that
witness.
now,
when
the
inquiry
is
to
the
employees
official
conduct
it
seems
to
me
is
under
an
obligation
to
make
complete
and
frank
disclosure.
the
same
obligation
he
would
have
if
he
will
call
before
the
board
of
higher
education
and
ask
the
question.
now,
in
addition,
the
state
legislature
undoubtedly
have
in
mind
that
certain
inferences
flow
from
the
invoking
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
do
not
say
that
there's
a
clear
inference
of
guilt.
what
we
do
say
is
that
under
the
law
as
interpreted
by
this
court
that
for
the
witness
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
he
must
sincerely
believe
that
his
answer
will
tend
to
forge
a
link
and
a
chain
of
evidence
which
may
lead
to
his
conviction
for
a
crime.
if
he
invoke
to
for
any
other
reason
he
is
invoking
it
improperly
and
he
has
invoking
it
perjuriously.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it
does
not
presuppose
guilt
but
it
does
presuppose
that
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
his
answer
will
provide
a
link
in
evidence
which
may
lead
to
his
guilt
and
the
peculiarl
thing
about
the
fifth
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
may
lead
to
his
conviction.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
as
i
read
the
case,
your
honor,
it
--
the
language
seems
to
be
to
forge
a
link
which
would
in
some
way
provide
a
chain
of
evidence
to
convict
him
of
a
crime.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
believe
that
a
plea
of
--
the
plea
could
be
consistent
with
innocence
but
i
do
say
that
you
can't
shut
off
the
inferences
which
ordinarily
must
flow.
the
ordinary
obligation
of
any
citizen
is
to
come
forward
and
give
full
and
complete
testimony.
but
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
order
to
protect
the
people
against
a
--
the
practice
of
torture
that
existed
in
the
old
english
law
setup
an
artificial
protection,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
when
the
protection
is
invoked
that
no
inferences
flow
there
from,
that's
especially
true
when
the
employee
is
call
before
a
body
that
has
a
right
to
know,
when
the
employee
is
called
upon
to
a
conference
conduct
and
he
then
retreats
behind
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
of
course,
was
dealing
only
with
a
senate
committee
and
there
are
many
areas
where
the
government
has
an
interest
in
the
operation
of
the
city.
for
instance
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
oh,
i
would
say
that
if
an
employee
of
the
board
authority
and
he
will
call
and
he
lived
in
new
york
and
was
called
to
new
jersey
which
is
a
--
a
member
of
the
agreement
that
he
would
have
to
answer.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
pass
on
that.
but
taking
your
facts
as
they
are,
if
he
did
certain
acts
in
new
jersey
which
would
justify
being
called
before
a
legislative
committee
in
new
jersey
and
the
questions
that
were
asked
concerning
those
acts
had
a
direct
bearing
on
his
fitness
as
a
teacher,
i
would
say
that,
in
my
own
opinion,
that
it
probably
would
apply.
but
as
i
say,
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
passed
on
that
set
facts.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
yes.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
was
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
the
chief
justice
question
was,
that
since
the
court
of
appeals
has
included
the
united
states
senate
as
a
legislative
committee
within
the
contemplation
of
section
903
might
not
the
same
question
be
presented
if
a
legislative
committee
in
new
jersey
asked
the
question.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
then
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
only
reservation
i
had,
your
honor,
is
this.
that
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
of
course,
the
section
of
the
education
law
that
provided
that
he
is
subject
to
punishment
for
conviction
of
a
crime
even
though
similar
conduct
would
not
be
a
crime
in
new
york
that
there
the
language
of
the
section
was
passed
on
by
the
court.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
that
the
new
jersey
legislature
had
a
proper
right
to
make
inquiry
of
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
at
the
outset
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
at
the
outset,
i
did
say
on
my
own
opinion
that
my
answer
to
that
would
be
yes,
but
i
didn't
want
to
preclude
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
opportunity
to
pass
on
that
question
when
it's
presented.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
the
state
legislature
hasn't
anticipated
that
when
it's
the
--
if
i
get
your
question
correctly,
that
when
it
relates
to
his
official
conduct
and
he
invokes
the
privilege
that
he
in
effect
hands
in
his
resignation.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
that's
correct.
similarly,
if
there
was
a
section
that
any
conviction
for
felony
barred
you
from
further
employment
as
you
have
in
some
states
that
would
be
the
same
situation.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it
would
not.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
because
there's
no
relationship
between
the
act
of
the
state
in
that
case.
in
other
words,
what
his
qualifications
as
a
teacher
has
to
do
with
his
foregoing
a
right
to
go
to
the
federal
courts
against
this
confiscation
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
this
court
would
say
that
the
claim
that
it's
an
attribute
of
good
citizenship
to
forego
a
review
before
a
federal
court
was
not
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
say
that
an
employee
who
is
called
to
answer
for
his
official
conduct
similarly,
even
dean
griswold
in
using
the
example
of
a
bank
teller
who
is
called
in
question
about
the
theft
of
a
$1000.
dean
griswold
says
that
when
the
bank
clerk
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
he
is
quite
properly
dismissed.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
would
say
it
was
similar
in
many
respects
to
the
garner
case.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
by
an
employee
in
relation
to
his
official
conduct?
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
not
by
anybody.
no.
and
if
the
question
were
not
as
official
conduct,
the
903
would
not
operate
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
if
the
question
directed
to
the
employee
had
no
relationship
to
his
official
conduct,
903
would
not
operate.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
can
conceive
some
matrimonial
situations
and
things
like
that.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
would
say
that
it
has
to
relate
to
his
official
conduct.
now
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
let's
put
the
question
the
other
way.
suppose
he
were
in
a
matrimonial
and
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
--
[laughter]
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i'm
saying
that
as
a
--
a
secondary
result
that
flows.
my
argument
has
two
prongs
to
it.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
one
is
that
his
got
an
obligation
to
cooperate
and
he
may
not
be
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
yes.
but
you
have
two
parallel
things
existing.
you
have
the
right
of
the
individual
on
the
one
hand
and
the
right
of
his
employer
on
the
other
hand.
now,
they're
both
existing
side
by
side,
the
employer
has
certain
rights
and
the
employee
has
certain
rights.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
would
say
that
this
court
has
held
in
many
instances
that
the
constitutional
privileges
are
not
absolute
rights.
for
instance,
in
the
prince
against
massachusetts
case
which
involved
the
child
who
was
selling
religious
pamphlets
in
massachusetts
and
the
child
was
under
the
age
of
12.
the
parent
was
arrested
or
the
child
was
taken
into
custody,
i
don't
recall
which.
now,
the
argument
was
--
they
made
there
that
that
child
was
an
ordained
minister
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
and
that
child
was
exercising
his
religious
freedom
which
is
given
to
him
under
the
constitution,
which
i
think
is
greater
right
than
the
right
against
self-incrimination.
yet
this
court
sustained
the
right
of
the
state
to
move
in
there
to
protect
the
child's
welfare.
similarly,
i
think
the
employee
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
that
this
is
the
first
time
it's
presented
to
this
court.
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
yes.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
yes.
that's
rather
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
is
my
position.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
but
i
don't
know
whether
that's
entirely
open
to
this
court
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
question
related
to
his
official
conduct.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
that's
our
reflection.
i
think
in
view
of
the
wieman
case,
that's
true.
i
would
say
though
that
this
case
is
not
too
different
in
many
respects
from
garner
against
the
board
of
supervisors
of
los
angeles.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
senator
ferguson
was
concerned
with
the
subversive
influence
in
our
national
public
school
system.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
he
cut
them
off
at
the
outset.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it's
doesn't
have
to
be
necessarily
that
it's
subversive
per
se.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
is
true.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
but
i
think
there
is
evidence
in
the
dennis
case
and
in
the
case
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
certainly,
a
question
as
to
communist
party
membership
would
be
the
opening
question
as
to
explore
in
whether
he
had
engaged
in
any
subversive
activity.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
we
do
have
this
case
before
us
that
the
senate
committee
was
endeavoring
to
explore
to
subversive
infiltration
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
to
our
public
school
system.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
question
wasn't
put
to
him.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
may
have
been
the
question
though.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
of
course
i
--
i
think
your
honor
is
probably
aware
that
during
those
years,
merely
prior
to
1941,
the
communist
party
had
made
its
most
successful
inroads
into
the
new
york
school
system.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
if
i
may
point
this
out
to
you
though,
your
honor.
if
you
recall
on
the
garner
case,
the
affidavit
requirement
called
upon
the
employee
to
state
whether
he
had
ever
been
or
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
the
communist
political
association.
in
other
words,
the
affidavit
was
seeking
information
and
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
yes.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
that
the
senate
committee
did
say
to
senator
ferguson
when
in
this
part
at
page
2
of
my
brief
i
quote
it.
“we
do
not
think
that
security
of
this
nation
is
determined
by
what
teachers
do
teach,
whether
or
not
they
follow
the
--
we
do
think
that
the
security
of
this
nation
is
determined
by
what
teachers
do
teach
whether
or
not
they
follow
the
communist
line
in
teaching,
whether
or
not
they
are
members
of
the
communist
party.”
and
then
he
goes
on
to
state
the
evidence
before
then
indicates
it
is
a
clear
close
relationship
between
membership
and
subversive
activity.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it
may
very
well
have
been
true.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
problem
i
have,
your
honor,
with
your
position
is
this,
if
i
may
be
so
bold.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
you
make
a
distinction
between
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
los
angeles
board
asking
the
question
and
the
question
would
have
covered
the
same
period
and
the
united
states
senate
subcommittee
asked
him
the
same
question
and
i
don't
quite
see
the
distinction.
that's
what
troubles
me.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
there
was
--
there
was
in
fact
automatic
--
in
effect
automatic
ouster
because
the
statute
require
the
--
that
the
affidavit
be
filled
out
and
when
they
refuse
to
fill
it
out,
the
only
issue
to
be
determine
whether
they
refuse
or
not
similarly
with
the
oath.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
determine
whether
a
membership
back
in
1941
would
have
a
relationship
to
his
official
conduct
of
1952.
i
think
it
may
very
well
be
a
proper
question
though
because
mr.
chief
justice,
you
got
to
pick
a
starting
point
in
all
these
inquiries.
and
the
person,
i
think
this
is
true
when
new
york,
has
nothing
to
fear
by
being
frank.
there
are
a
number
of
teachers
who
have
admitted
past
communist
party
membership
who
are
teaching
in
the
new
york
city
school
system
today.
the
problem
is
where
the
person
undertakes
to
cut
you
off
an
inquiry
and
cut
you
off
from
the
information
which
you
feel
you
have
a
right
to
have.
that's
the
problem.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
there
are
certain
elements
which
must
be
established,
your
honor.
if
he
went
into
court
and
he
raised
the
issue
that
the
question
did
not
have
a
relationship
to
his
official
conduct,
he
would
have
a
full
judicial
review
on
that
question
and
if
the
court
determined
it
did
not
then
section
903
would
not
be
operative.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
he
urged
it
as
part
of
his
due
process
argument.
now,
of
course
what
happen
there
was
that
the
board
of
higher
educations
got
an
official
transcript
of
his
testimony
and
they
determined
that
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
and
they
asked
the
corporation
counsel,
also
in
opinion
as
to
whether
the
board
of
higher
education
was
within
the
contemplation
of
that
section
and
the
answer
was
yes.
and
then
they
notified
him
that
he
had
brought
about
his
own
separation
from
service
by
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
this,
your
honor.
the
new
york
state
has
setup
a
system
whereby
employees
are
picked
on
a
competitive
basis
and
that
as
long
as
they
discharge
their
duties
faithfully
and
well
they
have
tenure.
they
may
not
be
disturbed.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
he
did
have
tenure.
and
that
is
all
contained
in
section
6206
of
the
state
education
law.
then
a
specific
statute
was
passed
covering
this
specific
situation
and
of
course
the
specific
statute,
section
903
takes
away
that
tenure
feature
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it's
--
as
though
you
have
in
your
resignation
as
judge
conway
said
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
oh,
yes.
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
as
judicial
review.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
board
of
course
has
the
initial
obligation
to
determine
it
and
when
the
board
determines
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
question
asked
in
its
official
duties.
they
say,
"you
have
separated
yourself
from
the
service."
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
not
before
the
board.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
he
is
not
given
notice
to
appear,
no.
but
he
is,
of
course,
given
as
he
had
here
a
complete
judicial
review.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
not
before
the
board
of
higher
education.
but
he
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
did
argue
it
before
the
court.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
if
he
were
charged
with
--
if
he
were
charged
with
something
else.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that's
right,
he
have
a
trial.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that's
right
and
then
of
course
judicial
review
of
that.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
because
the
specific
statute
superseded
the
general
statute.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
he
did
argue
that.
that
it
was
not
official
conduct.
he
argued
before
the
court
and
they
consider
that
problem.
he
had
a
complete
day
in
court
on
it.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
on
the
question
of
whether
this
was
it
--
on
the
issue
of
whether
this
question
is
the
communist
party
membership
had
a
bearing
on
his
official
conduct
for
a
relationship
to
it.
that
was
the
issue
decided
about
the
court.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
would
say
in
answering
either
question,
your
honor,
they
would
have
to
answer
both
because
when
they
would
determine
whether
it
was
a
question
relating
to
his
official
conduct,
having
a
mind
in
the
1941
date.
they
would
have
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
elements
which
you
speak
of
in
your
first
case.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
if
you
ask
me
whether
the
court
could
exercise
discretion
as
to
whether
he
should
be
dismissed
or
not.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
he
did
not
in
this
particular
case
have
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
but
the
court
could
if
they
believe
there
was
a
triable
issue
namely
as
to
whether
related
to
official
conduct
or
not.
they
could
send
it
out
for
trial
for
a
hearing.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
it
may
very
well
be
a
triable
issue.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
they
were
speaking
of
the
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
one
additional
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
one
additional
fact
you
have
which
is
not
in
the
example
that
the
chief
justice
gave,
was
that
he
was
then
a
teacher
in
1941.
in
the
chief
justice's
case,
he
was
not
a
teacher
in
1941,
he
became
a
teacher,
i
think,
the
year
was
1952.
now
there
you
may
have
a
different
question.
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
that.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
the
fact
that
this
man
was
a
teacher
in
1941.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
there's
a
--
the
time
limit
may
have
some
effect
on
whether
it
--
it
relates
to
his
official
conduct.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
that
might
very
well
be
a
pertinent
question.
maybe
he
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
party.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that
was
only
on
the
old
section
i
think
if
you'll
recall.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
of
course
i
cannot
dispute
that
with
you
but
i
think
on
the
affidavit,
the
language
was,
are
you
now
or
were
you
ever
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
the
communist
political
association,
i
think.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
and
in
that
event
of
course
the
searching
went
all
the
way
back
and
i
think
quite
properly
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
must
remember
what
he
is
doing.
he
is
saying
that
my
conduct
back
30
years
ago
may
provide
a
link
in
a
chain
of
evidence
against
me.
he
is
the
only
person
who
knows
what
that
link
maybe.
there
is
no
way
of
proving
it
to
his
mind.
if
he
believes
that
an
inquiry
back
that
far
still
has
light
enough
in
it
that
it
may
lead
to
his
indictment
for
a
crime.
now,
what
is
the
employer
to
conclude?
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
is
--
is
as
inconsistent
as
it
sounds.
he
maybe
innocent
but
he
do
--
he
does
know
that
he
has
some
connection
which
may
provide
evidence
against
him.
now,
i
think
his
employer
has
a
right
to
know
and
that
it's
inconsistent
to
say,
“i
want
to
cloak
myself
in
the
constitutional
protection
and
at
the
same
time,
i
want
to
preclude
you
from
mr.
employer
from
knowing
what
this
act
was.”
that's
the
problem
with
it.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
pleading
of
the
privilege.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
that
it's
a
question
of
you
can
have
you
taken
either.
you
can't
go
in
before
the
subcommittee
and
say,
"i'm
pleading
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination."
and
then
turn
around
and
say,
"but
of
course
i've
done
nothing
wrong."
the
privilege,
no
matter
how
an
expertly
pleaded,
must
be
given
effect
by
the
senate
subcommittee
which
was
held
by
this
court
in
the
quinn
case,
where
even
incorporated
by
reference.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
he
is
entitled
to
it,
your
honor,
but
at
the
same
time
you
got
to
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
employer.
he
is
entitled
to
an
explanation
and
if
it's
a
proper
inquiry
an
explanation
should
be
given.
we're
not
talking
of
the
--
a
person
coming
in
to
a
criminal
court.
we're
talking
now
where
he
is
called
upon
to
explain.
as
i
said
before
even
dean
griswold,
where
you
have
the
bank
teller
questioned
about
the
money
missing,
even
he
concedes
that
he
could
be
dismissed
for
propriety.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
would
say
that
it's
not
unreasonable
for
the
state
legislature
to
make
us
a
condition
that
the
employee
not
retreat
behind
the
privilege.
because
if
you
wait
for
a
hearing,
the
committee
in
many
cases
has
past
and
gone.
it
hasn't
accomplished
its
purpose,
he
swore
to
it.
and
i
would
say
that
the
legislature
probably
had
in
mind
that
they
wanted
to
urge
these
employees
to
give
full
cooperation
and
i
don't
think
that's
unreasonable.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
think
that
the
senate
committee
have
a
legitimate
interest.
let's
take
an
example.
suppose
they
gave
titled
money
--
title
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
doesn't
it
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
it
does
come
down
to
this,
is
a
state
without
power
to
extend
the
cooperation
of
the
employee
to
a
senate
committee.
suppose
in
the
case
of
a
bank
teller.
the
--
the
auditors
from
the
state
banking
commission
came
in
to
examine
the
books
and
they
ask
the
bank
teller
the
question.
would
the
bank
be
acting
with
undo
haste
in
dismissing
the
employee
when
he
said,
"i
will
answer?"
does
the
bank
have
to
go
through
the
mechanics
of
calling
the
teller
in
and
asked
him
the
same
question
themselves?
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that's
correct.
and
also
he
can
extend
the
area
of
cooperation
to
where
the
governmental
body
is.
i
don't
think
it's
a
reasonable
requirement
to
ask
the
employee
to
discharge.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
my
recollection
was
that
--
no.
i
think
the
last
time
the
communist
party
was
on
the
ballot
was
in
1936
because
they
failed
to
get
the
gubernatorial
vote.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
no.
there
was
not.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
but
we're
not
dealing
with
that
here.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
if
he
was
convicted
of
communism?
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
probably
not
be
valid
because
of
(voice

act
of
effect.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
for
being
a
communist
in
1941?
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
let's
see.
under
the
effect
of
this
statute
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
answer
is
no,
but
that
point
was
not
argued
below,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
difference
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
is
this
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
you're
starting
with
two
different
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
but
you
have
two
different
objectives,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
cases
are
analogous,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
consequence
in
the
one
maybe
illegal
and
the
consequence
in
the
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
result
is
that
he
maybe
barred.
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
last
point.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
trouble
i
have
with
that
is
this,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
if
you
--
may
i
just
say
this
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well
if
you
would
ask
me,
if
a
man
is
put
in
prison
illegally
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
and
another
man
is
put
in
prison
legally,
are
they
both
in
prison?
well,
of
course,
they
are
both
in
prison.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
but
one
is
imprison
illegally
and
the
other
is
illegally.
there's
a
distinction
(voice

--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
if
he
declines
to
answer
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
on
the
privilege
and
it
relates
to
his
official
conduct.
the
answer
is
that
the
statute
so
reads
--
may
i
make
this
last
point?
it
may
very
well
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
if
that
argument
was
made
would
have
severed
that
section
and
left
the
rest
of
the
statutes
stand
and
that
was
not
urged
below
and
i
don't
think
it's
proper
before
this
court.
