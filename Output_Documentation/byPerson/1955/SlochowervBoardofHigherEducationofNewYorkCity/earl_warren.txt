on

harry

mr.

chief

earl

mr.
london
--
mr.
london,
concerning
the
point
you
are
making
when
justice
frankfurter
asked
you
his
question
and
apropos
his
question
i
--
i
just
like
to
ask
you,
do
you
claim
that
this
man
has
been
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
that
he's
been
denied
due
process
or
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
do
you
make
the
--
the
point
of
equal
protection
of
laws,
denial
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
--
to
what
are
you
referring
now
mr.
london?
what
it
said
in
its
opinion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
where
is
it
found
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
mr.
london.
mr.
scannell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
purpose
did
--
did
the
appellant
raise
the
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
scannell
if
--
if
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals.
what
would
have
led
judge
desmond
in
his
dissenting
opinion
to
say,
“all
sides
conceive
that
aside
from
the
suppose
applicability
of
section
903,
the
teachers
could
not
be
deprived
to
their
position
for
exercising
their
fifth
amendment
right.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
though
that
unless
someone
had
raised
the
fifth
amendment
right,
there
wouldn't
be
any
occasion
for
him
to
conclude
that
all
sides
concede
that
except
for
that,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
presupposes
guilt
then
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
was
claiming
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
conviction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
difference
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
believe
that
--
that
a
claim
of
the
privilege,
it
could
be
consistent
with
innocence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
this
statute
--
this
statute
says
--
says,
any
legislative
committee
doesn't
say
just
to
state
of
new
york
or
the
state
of
--
or
the
government
of
united
states,
but
supposed
this
man
went
over
into
new
jersey.
and
the
--
and
the
state
legislative
committee
there
subpoenaed
him
and
brought
him
up
and
asked
him
the
same
questions
and
he
gave
the
same
answers.
what
would
you
--
what
would
you
do
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
might
not
--
might
not
the
other
state
have
the
same
interest
in
who
is
in
its
borders?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
let's
don't
take
that.
let's
just
take
him
as
a
citizen
over
in
that
citizen
of
new
york,
over
in
new
jersey
for
some
business
or
profession
purpose.
suppose
there's
a
group
of
educators
met
over
in
new
jersey.
i
suppose
petitioner
attended
that
convention.
suppose
he
made
a
speech
and
suppose
a
legislative
committee
immediately
subpoenaed
him
and
ask
him
the
same
questions
and
he
gave
the
same
answers.
do
you
think
that
would
be
grounds
for
immediate
dismissal
and
barring
for
the
rest
of
his
life
from
service
in
the
city
of
new
york
under
this
charter
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
automatic
ouster
if
--
in
los
angeles
for
a
failure
to
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
scannell,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
that
dr.
slochower,
instead
of
having
been
with
the
school
board
for
27
years
was
a
young
man,
too
young
to
have
been
a
teacher
even
in
1941.
suppose
he
went
to
work
for
the
school
board
in
1952
and
the
same
question
was
asked
to
him,
it
was
asked
in
this
case
and
he
claimed
his
--
his
privilege
as
he
did.
would
you
say
that
--
that
the
sanctions
of
903
could
be
applied
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but,
mr.
scannell,
if
903
applies
and
if
as
the
court
of
appeals
says,
that
his
dismissal
is
automatic.
how
could
this
young
man
that
i
mentioned
ever
get
to
show
that
the
--
his
conduct
in
1941,
ten
years
before
he
is
old
enough
to
be
a
teacher
did
not
have
any
relation
to
his
professional
conduct.
and
as
i
understand
he
is
automatically
ousted
from
his
position
by
reason
of
his
claim
of
the
privilege.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
merits
of
whether
it
affected
his
--
related
to
his
official
conduct
or
on
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
point
of
time?
is
that
in
point
of
time
or
take
this
young
man
that
i
spoke
of
a
little
while
ago?
would
he
have
a
judicial
review,
would
they
go
into
the
question
as
to
--
as
to
the
length
of
time
before
he
was
a
teacher.
and
his
age
and
the
relationship
and
so
forth
in
determining
whether
that
was
a
part
of
--
of
his
official
--
related
to
his
official
conduct
or
would
--
or
would
they
just
review
the
question
as
to
whether
membership
in
the
communist
party
has
--
as
he
refuse
to
testify
about.
was
in
itself
a
matter
that
affected
his
official
conduct
when
he
became
a
teacher?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
this
in
a
case
--
in
this
case
that
the
--
the
petitioner
has
here.
would
he
have
been
permitted
to
come
in
and
--
and
establish
that
he
had
been
in
the
school
system
for
27
years,
that
he
had
been
a
good
--
a
good
teacher?
that
he
had
never
--
never
brought
communism
or
any
other
--
other
ideology
into
his
teaching
and
that
he
had
been
in
all
respects
without
blemish.
could
he
have
--
could
he
have
offered
that
proof
or
the
purpose
of
getting
--
set
aside
this
automatic
dismissal
for
having
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
is
that
--
is
that
kind
of
proof
open
to
him
and
--
and
can
he
avail
himself
of
it
and
is
he
entitled
to
findings
on
those
--
on
those
things
in
order
to
determine
whether
this
is
within
his
official
conduct
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
a
triable
issue,
according
to
your
concept
of
--
of
1903.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
not
think
that
there's
--
that
the
fact
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
time
at
all
and
that
a
man
could
be
asked
a
question
about
his
conduct
30
years
ago
and
--
and
apparently
these
sanctions
of
903
would
--
would
be
applied
to
him
that
that
--
that
has
great
bearing
on
the
reasonableness
of
--
of
the
section
so
far
as
due
process
law
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
again,
we
get
back
to
the
question
as
to
whether
you
--
whether
you
believe
that
--
that
an
innocent
man
could
honestly
invoke
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment.
apparently,
you
do
not.
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
you
do
but
you,
wherever
we
get
to
the
point,
why
you
say,
"well
he
is
the
only
one
who
knows
and
his
employer
is
entitled
to
make
the
presumption
against
him."
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
scannell,
but
you
say
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
an
answer.
the
employer
didn't
asked
the
question
here.
it
was
an
entirely
different
jurisdiction
and
have
no
connection
with
it
then
he
--
he
doesn't
know
what
the
purpose
of
the
senatorial
committee
was
in
doing
it.
so,
it
isn't
a
denial
in
this
particular
case,
it
isn't
even
a
denial
to
answer
the
question
of
the
employer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
say
it
didn't
have
a
legitimate
interest,
but
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
your
--
that
your
statement
a
little
while
ago
that
the
--
you
have
to
put
yourself
in
the
employer.
he
has
a
right
to
--
he
has
a
right
to
know.
how
do
you
know
that
if
they
have
called
this
petitioner
into
the
--
into
the
office
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
but
what
he
would
stated
very
--
very
frankly
to
him
what
the
situation
was,
knowing
--
knowing
perhaps
the
--
the
manner
in
which
it
would
be
used
and
so
forth.
but
it
might
be
entirely
different
when
he
goes
before
another
jurisdiction
that
he's
conducting
an
investigation
for
an
entirely
different
purpose.
something
entirely
disassociated
from
the
public
school.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
london.
