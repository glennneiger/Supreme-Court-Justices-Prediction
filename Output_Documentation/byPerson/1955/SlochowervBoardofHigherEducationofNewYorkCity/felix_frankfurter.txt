justice
felix
frankfurter
the
matter
--
what
the
matter
is
the
question
is
narrowed
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
just
suggest
employees
in
the
abstract,
all
sorts
of
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
specific
class
of
the
employee,
(inaudible)
that
it's
all
teachers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
teacher?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
one
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
by
your
statement
that
for
a
commission
of
--
of
crime
it
would
not
be
charged
automatically,
that
seems
to
me,
there's
no
hearing
was
necessary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
was
saying
automatically
means
that
no
hearing
is
necessary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
under
902,
are
your
suggesting
that
because
a
hearing
is
necessary,
(inaudible)
under
new
york
law
that
that
is
a
necessary
requirement
of
due
process.
are
you
suggesting
that
if
a
hearing
is
given
in
those
case
and
not
in
a
case
like
this,
that
amounts
to
an
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
that
a
person
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
outstanding
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
sentence,
as
i
understand
it
on
the
new
york
law,
on
the
basis
of
that
it
cannot
automatically
(inaudible)
give
him
a
hearing.
whatever
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
new
york
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
say
that
although
that's
true
for
a
man
that
is
convicted
of
heinous
offense,
he
still
must
give
him
a
chance
to
explain
something,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
although
having
true
as
the
heinous
--
conviction
for
heinous
offense
merely,
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
cuts
his
head
off
without
any
opportunity
of
his
condition.
it's
something
(inaudible)
now,
i'm
asking
you,
are
you
claiming
the
requirement
of
a
hearing
in
the
case
of
--
even
though
there
is
a
conviction.
there's
a
necessary
requirement
of
due
process
or
are
you
claiming
that
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
the
fact
that
a
hearing
be
given
in
those
cases,
in
a
much
greater
passion
and
not
in
this
case,
isn't
that
a
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
just
logically,
that's
just
logical
point
you're
making?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
logical
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
there's
a
debating
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
here
to
lift
the
debating
point.
we're
here
to
see
what
constitutional
advice
there
is
in
an
answer
by
a
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
that's
what
i'm
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
many
unfairness
(inaudible)
might
be
unfairness.
the
legislation
of
the
48
states
that
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
denial
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
your
constitutional
point
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
--
i
suggest
you
address
yourself
to
that
and
not
worry
about
the
debating
point
of
the
corporation
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
wouldn't
--
could
he
be
persuaded
to
adopt
the
equal
protection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask,
why
you
didn't
raise
that
on
the
burden
against
the
common
question
(inaudible).
may
i
ask
why
that
issue
was
not
explicit
raised
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
implicitly
in
the
entire
brief.
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
been
granting
your
(inaudible)
restricted
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
not
the
point
you're
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
contrary
in
the
remittitur.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
remittitur
which
(inaudible)
to
certify
the
district
court
that
the
question
under
the
federal
constitution
was
real.
but
they
say
implicitly
if
the
federal
(inaudible)
it's
a
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
suppose
beyond
that
and
particularized
what
--
in
what
respect
was
a
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
evidently
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
think
that
in
its
decision,
it
says
on
the
question
that
you're
now
arguing,
namely,
that
the
state
can't
impair
whatever
the
fifth
amendment
gives
(inaudible).
that's
the
argument
you're
now
making,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
argument
you're
now
making,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
to
you
and
i'd
like
to
have
an
answer.
a
plain
english
of
the
remittitur
in
which
although
you
impliedly
asked
the
court
to
certify
to
this
court,
the
(inaudible)
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
court
of
appeals
haven't
(inaudible)
didn't
pass
on
it
because
it
did
certify
that
a
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
arose
but
it
is
significant,
silently
huge
to
certify
to
the
question
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
all
i'm
--
it's
the
matter
of
reading
english.
is
it
true
that
in
the
remittitur
they
say
explicitly
that
they
did
pass
on
the
constitutional
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
say
anything
about
having
pass
on
the
question
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
privilege
against
custom
and
(inaudible)
of
new
york
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
(inaudible)
referring
with
the
privilege
under
the
new
york
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
his
dissenting
opinion
under
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
opinion
doesn't
tell
me
what
the
court
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
troubled
by
this
mr.
london
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
have
been
asked
to
clarify
explicitly
the
ground
on
which
it
went,
to
strike
as
depriving
that
(inaudible)
sharing
of
words
that
they
wouldn't
say
and
he
also
consider
the
fifth
amendment
if
they
thought
they've
been,
when
they
wrote
a
whole
page
and
tell
you
they
went
on
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
necessary
to
raise
the
fourteenth
amendment
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
you
ask
for
remittitur,
is
it
your
claim
in
the
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
point
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
will
you
--
further
--
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
stated
awhile
ago,
that
if
you
think
no
argument
can
be
made
here
because
none
was
made
below,
due
process
--
deprived
of
due
process
in
relation
to
the
fifth
amendment
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
can't
quite
follow
that.
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
their
remittitur
that
the
question,
what
presented
under
the
due
process
clause
in
that
this
appellant,
slochower
claim
that
the
automatic
operation
of
section
903
depriving
of
(inaudible)
now,
903
means,
it
says
in
the
section,
“that
anybody
who
testifies
before
a
senate
committee
that
automatically
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
therefore,
i
do
not
see
how
the
court
of
appeals
certified
that,
that
one
can
say
if
you
cannot
consider
the
(inaudible)
before
he
testify
and
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
of
appeals
tells
that
it
was
(inaudible)
took
place,
namely,
that
the
automatic
operation
of
section
903
requires.
now,
what
is
your
automatic
operation,
namely,
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
senate
committee.
and
therefore,
we
have
to
consider
acquisitions
in
view
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
they
did
(inaudible)
the
relation,
the
legal
validity
of
taking
away
something
from
him
because
he
claimed
the
privilege
before
the
senate
committee.
it
doesn't
mean
that
or
does
it
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
had
no
trial.
that's
right.
he
said
he
had
no
trial
but
merely
because
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
he
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
of
appeals
--
did
they
--
they
considered
this
question
that
automatic
operation,
deprive
them
of
tenure
and
of
a
trial
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
conceived
to
be
the
function
of
a
remittitur
drawn
as
(inaudible)
particularity
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
motion
made
before
it
but
he
conceive
the
function
of
remittitur
to
be
for
our
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
go
behind
the
remittitur
and
see
whether
every
argument
that
knowledge
make
within
the
scope
of
the
remittitur
was
made
or
are
we
to
assume
when
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
tells
us,
“this
subject
matter
was
considered.”
we
are
to
consider
that
subject
matter
whatever
argument
you
--
in
support
or
is
it
on
opposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
makes
it
all
look
an
impossible
job.
(inaudible)
submitted
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
appellate
division,
supreme
court
and
to
check
all
arguments
to
see
whether
every
argument
is
(inaudible)
below
although,
it
was
the
same
language,
the
one
the
court
of
appeals
certified,
the
argument
needs
to
be
open.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
terms
that
if
he
--
from
this
case
namely,
and
would
have
a
direct
bearing,
how
could
you
tell
it
have
a
direct
bearing
unless
you
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
the
direct
bearing.
in
answer
to
chief
justice,
you
said,
“this
haven't
occured.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
whether
he
refuse
to
answer
would
have
a
direct
bearing
upon
him,
his
qualification
and
his
desirability
and
effectiveness
as
a
teacher.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
in
this
manner
would
exclude
any
such
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
you
have
to
answer
yes
because
in
the
(inaudible)
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
prevail
that
conviction
no
matter
where
and
i
don't
see
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
conviction
--
a
conviction
no
matter
where
or
what
irrelevant
because
(inaudible)
inclusive
as
that
and
a
statute
like
903
simply
says
an
investigation
without
limiting
it
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
got
a
ruling
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
if
it
isn't
relevant
to
new
york,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
--
on
what
possible
part
of
903
can
you
say,
that
covers
investigation
before
a
senate
committee
dealing
with
a
matter
(inaudible)
or
asserting
the
--
as
well
as
implicitly
unrelated
with
the
educational
system
of
new
york
is
within
the
statute
because
it
says
before
any
--
to
conduct
any
hearings
--
anyway,
how
can
you
say
that
it
applies
with
senate
committee
restricted
as
that
case
under
the
federal
constitution
but
doesn't
apply
to
a
committee
of
new
jersey
inquiring
about
the
desirable
educational
standard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
question
is
open
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
as
i
return
and
i
assume
you
said
it
would
deem
as
relevant
if
they
can
show
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
function
of
a
teacher.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
whole
point
about
this
case
is
that
the
question
now
is
relevant,
his
claim
of
(inaudible)
to
his
function
as
a
teacher
is
out,
not
initiated
because
the
consequence
follows
automatically.
is
that
right?
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
way
of
scraping
the
result.
the
fact
is
that
nobody
cared
whether
his
claim
of
privilege
did
or
did
not,
that
have
any
bearing
on
the
goodness
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
rely
--
you
were
--
you
invoked
what
you
call
the
principles
firs
stated
(inaudible)
and
justice
holmes
decision
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
think
all
of
it
or
was
it
--
you
think
all
that
justice
holmes
said
about
the
(inaudible)
of
constitutional
rights.
you
quote
all
of
it
and
therefore
i
assume
you
--
you
adopt
all
of
it.
it
said
the
--
well,
i
think
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
--
like
(inaudible)
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
cross-politics
but
he
has
no
constitutional
right
to
be
a
(inaudible).
i
don't
see
how
you
can
object
to
that.
there's
no
doubt
they'll
say.
there
are
few
employments
behind
so
this
does
not
agree
to
suspend
these
constitutional
rights
(inaudible)
relevant
argument
by
the
implied
(inaudible)
contract.
on
the
same
principle,
the
city
may
impose
any
reasonable
condition
upon
holding
off
his
immediate
control.”
did
you
agree
that
the
question
in
this
case
have
to
get
down
that
this
is
a
reasonable
condition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
that
is
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
can
consider
whether
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
precise
refusal
that
was
made,
when
it
was
made,
the
time
it
was
made
and
as
the
subject
matter
that
was
made.
and
all
the
refusal
requirement,
all
the
questions
on
ambiguity
for
them.
all
the
questions
that
were
about
asked.
and
in
the
precise
setting
of
this
case,
this
is
a
reasonable
condition.
that's
--
that
was
in
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fourteenth
amendment,
isn't
that
the
--
not
the
--
to
mean,
(inaudible)
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
saying,
that
there
was
a
necessarily
reasonable
relation.
what
was
done
here
and
the
consequences
have
to
suffer.
that
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
done
to
bring
it
to
the
power
of
this
court,
the
action
is
sustained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
to
you
a
very
important
--
i
suggest
to
you
a
very
important
(inaudible).
to
me
it
makes
a
lot
difference
whether
a
question
is
put
in
answering
to
refuse
by
senator
ferguson
in
relation
to
the
subject
matter
that
he
was
charged
with
inquiry
and
said
he
was
inquiring.
and
the
city
authority
themselves,
the
education
authority
of
the
city
putting
a
question,
it
was
their
teaching
that
they
deem
relevant.
it's
the
only
thing
that
concerns
the
educational
authority,
namely,
the
(inaudible)
of
a
teacher.
senator
ferguson
wasn't
at
all
concerned
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
to
indicate
remotely
that
this
man
declined
to
answer
whether
he
had
engaged
subversive
activities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
merely
said,
he
wouldn't
answer
whether
he
was
a
member
of
a
communist
party
in
1941.
and
this
court
had
solemnly
decided
that
in
1941
it
wasn't,
as
a
matter
of
law,
subversive
to
belong
to
the
communist
party.
that's
what
they
totally
decided
solemnly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
1941,
the
communist
party
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
political
party
with
the
column
on,
i
don't
know
in
how
many
states
having
american
citizen
(inaudible),
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
true
in
new
york,
was
it,
in
1941?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
dennis
case
came
later.
we're
not
talking
about
the
dennis
case,
even
the
dennis
case
said,
merely
to
belong
to
the
communist
party
is
not
an
offense
or
indicated
subversively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
suggesting
that
it
would
be
open
to
the
educational
party
of
new
york
to
pursue
that
inquiry.
that
isn't
the
exact
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
ask
(inaudible)
whether
he
ever
belong
to
an
organization
which
he
knew,
had
reason
to
believe
whether
subversive
organization
that
he
refuse
to
answer
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
he
refused
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
cannot
tell
why
senator
ferguson
didn't
ask
that
question.
i
do
know
he
didn't
ask
it
and
i
do
know
definitely
makes
you

suppose
it
is
important
to
put

i'm
suggesting
to
you

foreclose.
you're
saying
that
the

is
certain
there

suppose
that
this
was
an
official

not
to
ask
an
inquiry
relevant
to

the
senate
committee
was

i
guess
the
decision
is
not
to
answer
the
question
put

related

official
conduct.
justice

what
facts

he
was
