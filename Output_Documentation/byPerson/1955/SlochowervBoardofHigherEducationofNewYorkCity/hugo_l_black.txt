don't
let
me
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
raise
the
question
of
bill
of
attainment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
your
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say
all
federal
rights
or
just
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
barred
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
holding
jobs
in
new
york
if
they
invoke
any
privilege
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
constitution
gives
the
man
a
right
in
a
federal
court,
in
a
--
for
the
federal
congress,
claimed
the
benefit
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
a
privilege
or
immunity
granted
by
the
federal
government
for
him
to
claim
it
that's
called
on
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
the
constitutional
provision
which
says,
“no
man
shall
deprive
of
another,
there
is
no
state
should
deprive
one
of
his
privileges,
his
immunities
under
the
federal
constitution,”
would
fit
this
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
the
(inaudible)
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
lead
to
his
guilt
or
may
lead
to
his
conviction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
do
not
argue
that
it
is
an
irrevocable
conclusion
that
he
is
guilty.
i
say
that
the
only
time
he
may
invoke
it
is
if
he
honestly
believes
it
may
tend
to
lead
to
his
conviction.
and
the
peculiar
thing
about
the
fifth
amendment
is
that
the
reason
is
locked
up
in
the
mind
of
the
invoker.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
new
york
was
designed
--
it's
going
to
put
on
a
big
school
building
program
in
the
state
and
pass
the
law
to
the
effect,
that
every
man
must
accept
what
the
state
offered
for
his
land
because
it
was
for
school
purposes
and
to
find
public
purpose.
and
they
then
provided
that
no
man
could
hold
a
job
as
a
teacher
or
any
job
in
the
state,
if
he
invoke
the
privilege
of
the
federal
constitution
against
confiscation
of
his
property,
would
that
be
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
say
he's
not
a
good
citizen.
he
won't
cooperate
with
the
state.
he
shown
that
he
not
cooperative
and
trying
to
get
to
school,
this
great
public
school
program
and
--
and
we
will
not
let
him
serve
as
a
teacher
unless
he's
willing
to
do
that.
and
he
stands
on
it
and
says,
but
i
invoke
the
privilege
of
their
constitution
that
my
property
shall
not
be
taken
without
just
compensation.
and
they
say,
but
we've
determine
that
this
is
just
under
the
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
are
taking
the
position
necessarily
are
you
not?
that
it
shows
bad
citizenship
for
a
man
to
claim
the
privilege
except
against
self-incrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
that
you
couldn't
--
other
constitutional
privileges
they
could
claim
and
new
york
couldn't
do
anything
about
it.
because
it
wouldn't
affect
their
knowledge
as
to
their
citizenship.
but
here,
it
shows
a
man
as
a
bad
citizen
if
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
it
shows
he
is
a
bad
citizen?
is
that
the
basis
on
which
new
york
law
is
written?claiming
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
anybody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
its
official
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
you
think
of
any
question
that
had
to
do
with
the
man
committing
a
crime,
it
wouldn't
have
something
to
do
with
his
official
conduct
if
the
government
wanted
good
employees?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
what
if
it's
a
crime?
suppose
it's
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
felony.
he
claims
the
privilege
against
testifying
that
he
is
of
the
--
on
the
ground
that
might
infuse
--
incriminate
him
for
stealing.
you'd
say
that
shows
that
he
is
a
bad
citizenship
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that
relates
to
his
official
conduct,
the
fact
that
he
declined
to
admit,
deny
that
he
was
a
thief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'd
rather
talk
about
the
other
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
what
i'm
trying
to
find
is
and
i
think
your
law
was
good
and
maybe
it's
better
to
meet
for
what
it
is,
that
you're
saying
that
because
of
this
particular
constitutional
privilege
for
a
men
to
invoke
it,
shows
that
he
is
a
bad
citizen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
other
prong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
federal
constitution
says,
has
told
him
that
he
his
under
no
obligation
to
cooperate
in
that
way
by
incriminating
himself.
that's
what
the
federal
constitution
said,
doesn't
it?
and
its
about
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
what
it
says,
that
he
is
under
no
duty
to
cooperate
and
giving
evidence
against
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
constitutional
provision
says
that
an
employer
has
a
--
has
a
right
to
discharge
his
employee
because
he
claim
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
--
did
it
sustain
the
state's
right
to
do
something
to
him
because
he
claimed
that
privilege
and
keep
for
the
constitution.
has
there
even
been
--
has
there
ever
been
a
decision
by
this
court
that
sustain
a
state
law
which
did
something
to
person
in
a
way
of
injury
to
it
because
he
invoked
the
privilege
which
he
is
allowed
to
invoke
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
mr.
scannell,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
at
1941,
the
communist
party
was
legal
in
its
faith
and
could
run
--
people
could
run
on
that
ticket?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
was
there
any
law
against
them
being
on
the
ticket?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
now
pass
a
law
which
provided
that
a
man
should
be
prosecuted
after
a
full
hearing
and
convict
him
for
having
been
a
member
of
that
party
in
1941?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
suppose
--
suppose
you
would
have
to
passed
the
law
which
provided
that
the
sole
punishment
that
the
man
who
was
convicted
for
having
been
a
communist
in
1941
should
be
barred
from
holding
any
office
or
profit
in
the
state
or
in
a
job
where
he
works
for
the
state.
would
that
be
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
provided
a
new
law
now,
to
the
effect
that
any
man
who
was
found
guilty
of
having
been
a
communist
in
1941
could
be
subjected
to
punishment
and
the
punishment
would
be
that
he
should
be
barred
from
then
on
from
holding
any
job
under
the
state.
would
that
be
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
not,
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
what
is
the
effect
of
this
with
reference
to
a
man
who
simply
deny
having
been
a
communist
in
1941.
is
he
barred
from
holding
any
office
or
any
job
in
the
state
for
the
rest
of
his
life?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
--
for
having
declined
to
answer
whether
he
was
a
communist
in
1941.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
he
hold
any
job
under
the
state
thereafter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what
is
argued.
the
effect
--
the
effect
then
of
this
is
precisely
the
same
is
it
not,
as
though
the
state
had
passed
a
law
which
said,
“that
any
man
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1941
which
was
not
illegal
then,
cannot
hereafter
hold
any
job
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
the
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
what
is
the
difference
in
the
consequence
to
the
man
except
here
that
instead
of
being
barred
from
having
a
job
because
he
belong
to
the
communist
party.
he's
barred
for
life
from
belonging
--
from
having
a
job
because
he
refuses
admit
whether
he
did
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
--
the
consequence
in
each
one
would
be
that
he
is
barred
from
holding
a
job
with
the
state
for
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
(voice
overlap)
consequence
wasn't
it?
so
that
what
you're
doing
here
is
indirect,
the
same
as
though
you
have
passed
the
law
which
stated,
“that
any
man
who
belong
to
this
communist
party
in
1941
when
it
was
legal
and
who
refused
to
admit
it
should
be
barred
from
holding
a
job
for
the
state
for
the
rest
of
his
life.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
the
result?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
the
result
of
what
your
law
does?
does
it
provide
that
if
a
man
declines
to
admit
or
refuses
--
deny
or
admit
whether
he
was
a
communist
in
1941
he
should
be
barred
from
holding
a
job
for
the
state
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
result
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
just
like
to
know
if
that's
what
it
does,
if
it's
not,
tell
me
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
ask
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
having
--
now
having
answered
that.
will
you
answer
this?
if
--
is
the
effect
of
your
law
now
as
you
have
it,
the
man
who
belong
to
the
communist
party
at
1941
or
a
man
who
refuses
to
admit
whether
he
did
it
or
not
in
1941
whether
it's
perfectly
illegal
to
be
a
communist
and
he
declines
to
answer
it,
can
be
barred
--
is
barred
from
holding
a
job
for
new
york
in
york
state
for
the
rest
of
his
life?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
statute
so
read,
you
mean
that's
what
it
does?
