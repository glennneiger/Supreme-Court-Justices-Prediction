mr.
carl
l.
phinney
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
frozen
food
express
and
brought
these
two
bills
of
complaint
and
the
case
of
158
and
the
other
case
wherein
the
court
enjoined
the
interstate
commerce
commission
from
interfering
with
our
transportation
of
dressed
poultry.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
department
of
agriculture
intervened
and
we
have
attempted
in
the
determination
case
and
also
in
the
other
case
to
express
our
views
on
the
matter
and
so
for
first
as
relating
to
the
determination
case,
my
situation
is
a
little
different
from
that
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
want
this
court
to
hold
that
it
is
an
appealable
order
and
then
i
want
a
court
to
hold
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
enter
it.
we
had
this
situation,
the
united
states
of
america
through
the
solicitor
general
confessed
error
in
both
of
these
cases
and
insofar
as
it
related
to
the
items
of
slaughtered
meat
animals
and
fresh
meats,
dressed
and
cut
off
poultry,
fresh
or
frozen,
feathers,
raw
shell
peanuts
and
raw
shell
nuts
and
other
items
i
believe
a
total
of
nine
in
number.
the
matter
of
the
exemption
provision,
it
is
in
the
interpretation
or
in
the
definition
section
of
the
motor
carrier
act
part
ii.
it
takes
away
from
the
commission
that
nothing
in
this
party
except
the
provisions
of
204
relative
to
the
qualification
and
maximum
hours
of
service
of
the
employees
and
safety
of
operation
shall
be
construed
to
include.
now,
these
are
things
that
the
--
the
congress
took
away
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
insofar
as
the
certificate
section,
insofar
as
the
permit
or
the
rate
section
is
concerned
and
said
they
shall
be
exempt.
one
of
them
is
--
motor
vehicles
controlled
and
operated
by
any
farmer
when
used
in
the
transportation
of
his
agricultural
commodities
and
products
thereof
or
in
the
transportation
of
supplies
to
his
farm
that
is
in
addition
to
the
exemption
that
is
--
that
is
contained
in
a
subparagraph
6
which
reads,
motor
vehicles
used
in
carrying
property
consisting
of
ordinary
livestock,
fish,
including
shellfish,
are
agricultural
commodities
parenthetically
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof.
now,
in
addition,
congress
put
this
further
safety
or
--
or
exemption
on
it
if
such
motor
vehicles
are
not
used
in
carrying
any
other
property
or
passengers
for
compensation.
now,
it
--
it
is
our
position
that
--
that
is
a
--
a
phrase
that
is
not
susceptible
of
anything
except
an
ordinary
interpretation
and
that
is
an
agriculture
commodity.
and
that
in
the
question
of
the
determination
case,
it
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
so
far
as
this
part
of
the
act
was
concerned,
to
want
to
aid
the
farmers
because
they
put
another
provision
and
that
to
helped
the
farmers
anyway.
but
i
advice
my
clients
that
under
the
law,
if
we
felt
that
we
had
the
--
the
right
to
transport
in
the
48
states
in
the
district
of
columbia
any
agricultural
commodity,
so
long
as
it
did
not
constitute
a
manufactured
product
thereof.
now,
these
cases
are
so
intertwined,
i
hope
the
court
will
forgive
me
if
i
go
from
one
to
the
other,
but
i
want
to
--
in
--
in
connection
with
the
determination
case,
i
want
to
read
what
the
court
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
as
found
on
page
11
of
our
brief
in
158
insofar
as
the
complaint
case
was
concerned.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
on
its
--
in
the
record
35,
the
facts
before
us
in
this
preceding
are
more
complete
as
they
relate
to
this
particular
issue
than
those
before
us
in
the
exemption
case.
but
they
contain
nothing
to
warrant
any
different
conclusion.
on
the
contrary,
they
confirm
the
conclusions
that
i
reached.
then
they
also
said,
until
a
final
decision
contrary
to
the
findings
in
the
exemption
case
is
reached
by
the
courts,
we
adhere
to
the
conclusion
that
the
transportation
of
fresh
and
frozen
meats
and
fresh
and
frozen
dressed
poultry
are
subject
to
the
certificate
and
permit
requirements
of
the
act.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
until
a
final
decision
contrary
to
the
findings
in
the
exemption
case
is
reached
by
the
courts.
we
adhere
to
the
conclusion
so
forth.
now,
let
me
pass
from
that
just
a
moment
to
the
opinion
that
was
expressed
by
judge
connelly
and
the-three
judge
federal
court
in
the
southern
district
of
texas
contained
on
page
55
of
the
record
in
162.
talking
about
the
los
angeles
railroad
company
case
whether
or
not
this
is
an
appealable
order,
the
so-called
order
here
complained
of
is
one
which
does
not
command
the
carrier
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
doing
anything
which
does
not
grant
or
withhold
any
authority,
privilege
or
license,
which
does
not
intend,
extend
or
bridge
any
power
or
facility
and
which
does
not
subject
to
carry
it
to
any
liability
civil
or
criminal.
now,
let
me
lay
that
test
down
to
the
case
we
have
under
consideration
here,
because
if
this
determination
case
stands
so
to
speak
as
the
sword
of
damocles
over
the
heads
of
anybody
who
seek
to
transport
these
commodities
without
the
certificate
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
what
happened
to
us
when
sought
to
transport
these
commodities,
we
were
subjected
immediately
to
a
complaint
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
as
a
result
of
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
we
were
given
a
cease
and
desist
order
to
where
we
could
no
longer
transport
those
commodities.
now,
certainly,
whether
you
call
it
an
order
or
a
finding
or
what
not,
the
effect
of
the
determination
case
on
the
transportation
industry
today
and
on
those
who
seek
to
hold
these
commodities
without
regulation
or
certificates
or
tariffs
has
the
same
portion
effect
as
any
kind
of
an
order
whether
you
ended
it
as
so
ordered
and
so
forth
or
whether
or
not
it
is
contained
in
the
same
language
and
cast
in
the
same
language
that
it
is
now.
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
so
long
as
the
determination
order
is
left
as
it
is,
either
saying
that
the
commission
did
not
have
the
authority
to
enter
the
order
and
regulating
these
commodities
or
saying
that
they
did
have
the
authority
and
that
the
carriers
who
seek
to
transport
these
commodities
will
have
to
abide
by
them,
we
then
must
go
constantly
into
the
courts
and
seek
an
interpretation
or
a
determination
of
each
of
the
commodities
that
we
think
constitute
agricultural
commodities.
that,
of
course,
is
a
bad
situation
insofar
as
my
client
is
concerned
because
we
were
experiencing
a
terrific
loss
of
business
to
these
people
who
were
operating
without
regulation.
and
it
was
--
we
had
certificates
as
the
record
shows
to
operate
transporting
--
in
17
states
items
ordinarily
constituting
frozen
foods
which
move
under
refrigeration.
but
little
by
little,
here,
somebody
started
carrying
these
commodities
in
those
and
they
took
them
away
from
us
to
where
as
i
have
previously
mentioned
to
this
court
and
i
advise
my
client
that
upon
an
examination
of
the
order
and
upon
an
examination
of
the
law
that
we
felt
that
we
had
the
authority
without
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
transporting
those
commodities
which
we
had
the
cease
and
desist
order
issued
against
us.
the
same
thing
is
true,
i
think,
throughout
the
record
in
the
determination
case,
there
--
there
seems
to
be
a
confusion
between
processing
and
manufacturing.
now,
take
a
peanut,
the
commission
has
held
in
the
determination
case
that
a
peanut
within
the
hull
or
of
corn
within
the
hull
is
an
agricultural
commodity
and
can
be
transported
but
once
you
mash
that
shell
and
take
the
nut
out
of
the
hull
that
it
becomes
manufactured.
the
other
items
as
i
have
enumerated
that
the
united
states
to
the
solicitor
general
agreed
with
our
position
on
the
matter
reach
practically
the
same
general
propositions
where
they
go
upon
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
processed
or
whether
or
not
it
was
manufactured.
the
--
this
court,
in
a
good
many
opinions,
and
i
--
i
want
to
direct
your
attention,
if
you
please,
to
one
or
two
of
them,
have
treated
on
this
question
of
manufacture,
one
of
the
leading
case
is
being
the
anheuser-busch
association
versus
the
united
states
in
207
u.s.556.
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
manufacturer
implies
a
change,
but
every
change
is
not
a
manufacture
and
yet
every
change
in
an
article
is
the
result
of
treatment,
labor
and
manipulation.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
but
something
more
is
necessary,
there
must
be
transformation,
a
new
and
different
article
must
emerge
having
a
distinctive
name
character
and
use.
then
it
goes
ahead
and
explains
how
this
machine
is
used
to
take
the
bugs
and
the
dirt
and
things
from
the
cork
and
that
it
is
used
in
order,
i
believe,
that
beer
may
taste
or
be
without
the
taste
of
cork
and
be
sanitary
and
held
that
was
a
--
a
processing
rather
than
a
manufacture
that
it
--
as
they
did
in
the
hartranft
versus
wiegmann,
121
u.s.609,
where
layers
of
shell
were
removed
and
the
inner
part
of
a
shell
was
polished
with
a
mantel
put
on
it.
they
said
it
still
constituted
a
shell
and
had
not
been
manufactured
and
was
a
process
and
was
therefore
would
not
come
within
the
tariff
provisions
that
require
that
the
item
be
manufactured.
i
--
i
want
to
leave
this
thought
with
the
court,
i
am
not
going
to
trespass
on
your
time
longer.
i
think
this
matter
has
been
very
thoroughly
drawn
over
that
we
have
had
may
lawsuits
in
various
jurisdictions
concerning
this
question.
and
certainly,
if
the
determination
case
is
left
hanging,
suspending
as
it
is
now,
we
will
never
know
until
we
go
in
to
the
court
and
seek
an
injunction
against
the
commission
whether
or
not
we
have
the
authority
to
transport
it
or
we
do
not.
likewise,
the
--
the
same
thing
would
be
true
of
all
of
the
other
parties
throughout
the
united
states
that
seek
to
transport
these
agricultural
commodities.
we
think
certainly
that
under
the
history
of
this
legislation
where
congress
refused
an
amendment
that
would
permit
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
pass
upon
whether
or
not
they
were
agricultural
commodities,
that
they
intended
that
the
agricultural
commodities
so
long
as
they
did
not
constitute
manufactured
products
thereof
would
be
exempt
and
that
we
were
entitled
so
long
as
we
met
the
other
requirements
of
the
law
if
we
are
entitled
to
transport
those
commodities
into
and
out
of
48
states
in
the
district
of
columbia
without
the
necessity
of
seeking
any
character
of
the
certificate
or
permit.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
the
--
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
if
--
there
--may
i
--
your
honor,
may
i
put
it
this
way.
there
can
be
a
determination
made
of
poultry
--
dressed
poultry
being
an
agricultural
product
without
passing
upon
the
other
items
but
so
long
as
the
determination
case
stands,
that
simply
removes
one
portion
of
it
from
the
--
in
decision
so
to
speak
that
they
exist
now
throughout
the
united
states
where
the
other
items
would
have
to
be
litigated
again
to
determine.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
no
sir.
i
think
that
the
determination
case
can
be
decided
in
the
poultry
case,
if
i
follow
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
of
course,
the
questioning
--
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
that's
the
--
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
no
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
no
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
sir?
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
provided
it
reached
them,
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
and
we
--
we
therefore
urge
that
in
a
--in
a
decision
of
these
cases,
i
am
not
going
to
go
into
detail
about
what
our
allegations
were
and
what
the
proof
was
but
if
we
can
get
to
the
issues,
i
--
i
am
hopeful
that
we
can
get
a
determination
of
both
of
these
complaints
in
this
case.
are
there
any
other
questions?
thank
you
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
i
think
we
are
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
i
think
we
are
subject
to
injunctions
by
federal
district
court
and
as
well
as
the
filing
of
complaints
as
they
did
to
us
in
the
second
case.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
well,
we
--
we
certainly
agreed
with
--
with
his
position
that
if
--
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
the
authority
to
enter
the
determination
case
and
to
determine
what
constitutes
agricultural
commodities,
we
are
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
just
as
much
as
if
we
were
holding
some
item
that
was
not
an
agricultural
commodity.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
i
think
they
can
file
a
complaint
and
not
--
and
it
has
been
done
to
my
knowledge,
they
have
filed
a
complaints
and
informations
in
federal
court
on
--
on
identity
of
those
same
things.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
thank
you
so
much,
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
justice
clark,
we
have
raised
all
of
the
items
in
the
determination
case,
we
--
we
are
taking
the
position
that
we
can
transport
all
agricultural
commodities
and
i
--
i
presume
if
the
court
would
write
on
that
--
on
that
feature
of
it
that
it
--
it
would
cover
all
of
the
agricultural
commodities.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
sir.
i
introduced
before
the
court
in
the
three-judge
federal
court,
i
introduced
the
entire
record
that
was
made
it,
i
think
15,000
pages
in
this
determination
case.
and
of
course,
we
had
no
indication
that
this
thing
were
going
off
on
the
theory
that
it
was
not
an
appealable
order,
but
i
felt
in
bringing
the
two
complaints
that
the
only
way
we
could
get
to
it
was
to
attack
the
determination
order
as
well
as
to
make
an
appeal
from
the
--
that
part
of
the
cease
and
desist
order
that
it
had
been
able
to
complain
the
case.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
thank
you
mr.
phinney.
mr.
macdonald,
you
gave
us
a
citation
to
some
law
review
article,
would
you
mind
repeating
that
please?
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
yes,
and
only
--
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
if
you
follow
both
the
reasoning
of
the
commission
and
the
district
court
that
the
livestock
exemption
fixes
the
limits
as
far,
as
meats
are
concerned,
if
that
is
as
far
as
meats
derived
from
those
animals
which
come
under
the
livestock
exemption.
if
you
reject
that
view,
then
you
have
the
same
situation,
i
think,
as
to
meats
and
dressed
poultry.
the
only
question
on
which
this
court
can
rule,
however,
is
that
i
would
suppose
the
issue
that
has
been
brought
before
it.
mr.
carl
l.
phinney
if
there
are
no
other
question,
we
submit
the
case.
