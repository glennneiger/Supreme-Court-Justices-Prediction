mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
united
states
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
it
has
already
been
stated
that
they
take
no
position
on
the
reviewability
of
the
order
in
the
determination
proceeding.
it
has
also
been
stated
that
in
the
appeals
taken
from
the
order
in
the
complaint
proceeding,
they
support
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
holding
that
dressed
poultry
is
with
--
that
in
the
exemption
given
by
section
203
(b)
(6)
of
the
act
and
that
therefore,
frozen
food
may
transport
this
kind
of
poultry
without
having
a
prior
authorization
from
the
commission.
we
believe,
first,
that
the
words
of
statute
point
in
this
direction.
the
exemption
of
agriculture
commodities,
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof,
necessarily
means
that
an
agricultural
commodity
stays
within
the
exemption
until
it
has
been
converted
into
a
manufactured
product.
the
only
disputed
question
is
whether
dressed
poultry
has
been
converted
into
a
manufactured
product.
the
housewife
who
goes
into
a
store
to
buy
a
chicken
gets
something
that
is
called
a
chicken
that
has
the
form
of
a
chicken
and
it
has
the
same
food
content
of
that
chicken
when
alive.
i
suspect
that
she
would
be
considerably
startled
and
told
that
she
was
buying
a
manufactured
product.
fresh
chicken
is
not
a
manufactured
product
in
ordinary
parlance,
nor
is
it
under
definitions
given
by
this
court.
it
is
defined
manufacture,
as
meaning
making
a
new
and
different
particle
having
a
distinctive
name
character
or
use.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
because
of
the
source
of
the
statutory
exemption,
one
is
derived
from
the
livestock
exemption
and
the
other
from
the
agricultural
commodity
exemption.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
because
the
livestock
exemption
by
adopting
the
definition,
it's
using
the
word
ordinary
livestock
it
adopted
the
definition
of
those
words
in
paragraph
1
--,
section
1,
paragraph
22
of
the
act
which
specifically
refers
to
live
animals.
and
it
could
not
embrace
those
--
the
products
of
slaughter.
now,
it
also
could
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
it
could.
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
that
was
the
position
of
frozen
foods
in
the
court
below.
the
court
moved
against
within
that
and
no
party
has
appealed
from
that
decision.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
was
--
well,
i
do
think
there
is
this
difference
that
they
do
derive
from
different
statutory
provisions
and
there
is
a
possible
implication
that
congress
having
specifically
provided
for
livestock
meant
to
include
it
under
those
words,
everything
relating
to
livestock,
poultry
being
outside
that
and
livestock
exemption
could
not
--
possibly
be
so
--
so
covered.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
commission
has
held
it
is
not
exempt
and
also
that
is
not
involved
in
the
case
now
before
the
court.
now,
counsel
for
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
i
could
--
i
could
give
you
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
specific
language
which
has
been
adopted
by
in
effect
by
reference
is
shall
include
all
cattle,
swine,
sheep,
goats,
horses
and
mules
except
such
as
a
cheaply
variable
for
breeding
race
and
show
purposes
or
other
special
purposes.
congress
--
the
original
exemption
provided
for
livestock,
congress
wrote
in
the
words
ordinary
--
the
word
"ordinary"
in
front
of
livestock
so
as
to
make
applicable
this
definition
that
was
already
in
the
act.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
everybody
has
agreed
that
live
chicken
is
an
agricultural
commodity.
it's
just
a
question
whether
when
it
becomes
dressed
it
is
excluded
by
virtue
of
being
regarded
as
manufactured.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
they
don't
even
reach
that
point
at
least
in
the
commission's
approach
to
the
question
that
since
the
livestock
exemption
dealt
only
with
live
animals,
the
products
of
slaughter
could
not
be
within
that
exemption.
i
agree
that
an
argument
can
certainly
be
made
that
the
--
these
are
within
the
general
agricultural
commodity
exemption.
now,
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
certainly
think
that
this
exemption
was
given
explicitly
in
order
to
make
available
to
the
agricultural
community
the
advantage
of
flexible
and
i
may
say
that
poultry
raising
like
many
other
aspects
of
agriculture
is
seasonal
and
competitive
motor
transportation.
obviously,
the
cost
of
getting
products
to
the
ultimate
consuming
market
affects
the
price
which
the
grower
producer
can
obtain.
and
the
legislative
history
shows
beyond
any
question
that
the
extension
goes
beyond
the
point
of
first
processing,
the
commission
itself
has
so
ruled,
that
is
--
that
it
has
ruled
that
that
does
not
fix
the
point
and
that
could
only
be
on
the
theory
that
the
cost
to
getting
all
the
way
to
consuming
markets
affects
the
farming
community.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
it's
--
it's
always
a
question
of
how
far
you
go.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
let
me
--
let
me
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
did
take
that
position
in
the
district
court.
now,
frozen
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
frozen
food,
for
its
own
reason,
did
not
choose
to
appeal
from
that
aspect.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
think
there
is
a
good
deal
of
difference.
a
sheep,
cow
is
cut
into
an
infinite
variety
of
meats,
byproducts,
the
ordinary
point
of
processing
is
the
large
stockyards,
transportation
beyond
that
point
is
not
as
anywhere
nearly
as
closely
related
to
the
price
that
the
grower
or
producer
gets
as
getting
poultry
into
the
consuming
market.
it
doesn't
matter
in
that
case
whether
the
processing
is
on
the
farm
or
the
point
along
the
way.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
these
are
arguments
merely
to
show
the
basis
on
which
congress
acted
in
providing
these
exemptions,
in
other
words,
that
it
did
intend
to
preserve
for
the
agricultural
community
certain
advantages.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
when
you
really
look
at
legislative
history,
the
question
is
not
ambiguous
as
far
as
dressed
poultry
is
concerned.
let
me
repeat,
the
way
this
section
originated,
the
house
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
committee
reported
the
senate
bill
for
the
proposed
amendment
to
observe
the
transportation
of
unprocessed
agricultural
commodities.
when
this
came
on
for
debate,
various
members
expressed
doubt
as
to
whether
this
would
include
pasteurized
milk
and
ginned
cotton,
obviously
processed.
and
the
--
there
was
offered
on
behalf
of
the
committee
an
amendment
to
the
committee
men
to
strike
the
words
--
word
unprocessed
and
add
the
words
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof
and
was
specifically
stated
that
with
this
broaden
change,
the
amendment
would
apply
to
transportation
of
pasteurized
milk
and
ginned
cotton.
so,
first,
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
they
would
not
be
excluded
by
the
word
"manufactured."
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
so
that
the
exemption
applies
to
processed
commodities
if
the
processing
does
not
exceed
that
involved
in
pasteurizing
milk
or
ginning
cotton.
i
think
we
can
look
at
what
the
processes
which
milk
has
undergone
and
still
on
the
basis
of
that
commission's
ruling
in
the
determination
case
be
not
manufactured
and
be
still
within
the
exemption.
it
held
that
this
was
true
as
to
milk
which
had
been
pasteurized,
homogenized,
standardized
and
with
vitamin
concentrates
added.
the
commission's
report
shows
what
these
processes
involved.pasteurization
is
heating
the
milk
to
a
sufficiently
high
temperature
and
for
sufficient
period
of
time
to
kill
the
germs
in
it.
homogenization
is
a
process
to
reduce
the
fat,
the
size
of
the
fat
globules
in
the
milk.
standardization
is
adding
skimmed
milk
so
as
to
reduce
the
milk's
percentage
of
butter
fat
content
to
the
minimum
standard
required
by
state
law
and
adding
vitamins
adds
components
similar
to
those
already
in
the
milk.
i
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
commission's
conclusion
that
these
extensive
operations
which
it
found
were
almost
always
carried
on
in
dairies
rather
than
on
the
farm,
did
not
result
in
manufactured
product,
but
the
killing,
the
feathering
and
cleaning
of
chicken
makes
it
a
manufactured
product.
now,
it
has
been
argued
that
this
act
should
be
construed
as
a
whole
and
that
its
overall
purpose
was
to
curd
the
evil
of
over
competition
in
the
motor
carrier
industry.we
do
not
dispute
either
of
these
propositions
but
in
viewing
the
act
as
a
whole,
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
congress
placed
expressed
limitations
on
the
transportation
which
was
made
subject
to
the
commission's
regulatory
authority.
the
purpose
which
underlies
these
limitations
must
be
as
much
respected
as
the
purpose
underlying
the
grant
of
general
authority.
there
is
not
much
doubt
as
to
the
general
mood
in
this
position
of
congress
when
it
enacted
section
203
(b)
(6).
it
not
only
changed
the
committee
bill,
so
as
to
include
under
it
processed
agricultural
commodities,
it
adapted
two
other
broadening
amendments
to
the
section.
it
also,
as
general
phinney
mentioned,
provided
a
separate
exemption
for
farmers
operating
their
vehicles
to
carry
agricultural
commodities
or
to
carry
supplies
to
their
farms.
and
they
say
that
it
--
as
the
section
was
originally
proposed,
the
commission
could
have
in
effect
set
it
aside
if
it
found
they'd
tended
to
defeat
the
transportation
policy
of
congress
as
declared
in
the
act.
this
was
changed.
congress
said
that
it
did
not
want
to
leave
this
matter
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission,
that
it
intended
it
to
be
mandatory.
the
commission
has
consistently
given
this
section
a
restrictive
interpretation.
in
eight
out
of
ten
cases
in
the
federal
courts
under
the
section,
its
interpretation
has
been
found
unduly
restrictive
and
erroneous,
and
four
of
the
eight
cases,
the
matter
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
mentioned
that
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
district
court,
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals,
downed
against
the
commission.
under
the
word
"fish",
it
said
that
if
a
fish
had
its
head
cut
off,
it
was
no
longer
within
the
exemption,
nothing
more
than
head
cutoff.
and
we
have
heard
that
shelling
of
peanut
makes
it
manufactured.in
the
kroblin
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
held
that
dressed
poultry
is
within
the
agricultural
exemption.
it
said
that
the
position
of
the
commission
was
simply
that
as
a
matter
of
giving
the
motor
carrier
regulation
as
wide
as
scope
is
possible,
a
chicken
should
be
regarded
as
converted
into
a
manufactured
product
when
its
head
is
cut
off.
the
court
said
that
neither
the
language,
nor
the
spirit
of
the
exemption
warrant
that
any
such
artificial
concept.
now,
some
reliance
is
placed
on
the
established
rule
that
agency
interpretation
of
a
statute
is
to
be
given
special
consideration.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
courts
blindly
accept
administrative
construction
without
regard
to
the
factors
which
do
or
do
not
give
it
weight.
and
the
skidmore
case
323
u.s.,
the
court
said
that
the
weight
of
agency
interpretation
depends
upon
the
evidence
there
--
evidence
in
its
consideration,
the
validity
of
its
reasoning
and
its
consistency
with
earlier
and
later
pronouncements.
now,
i
submit
that
by
this
test,
the
commission's
ruling
is
that
dressed
poultry
is
entitled
to
very
little
weight.
our
brief
points
out
that
the
commission
has
reached
its
conclusion
as
to
dressed
poultry
on
three
entirely
different
grounds
that
it
subsequently
itself
decided
that
the
first
two
of
these
grounds
were
erroneous.
now,
its
third
ground,
given
in
the
determination
case
and
repeated
in
the
present
complaint
case,
was
that
since
the
words
ordinary
livestock
embraced
only
the
live
cattle,
it
logically
follows
that
the
words
agricultural
commodities
embrace
only
live
poultry.
but
the
boundary
of
the
exemption
as
to
agricultural
commodities
is
fixed
by
what
becomes
manufactured,
not
by
continued
life,
any
harvested
crop
is
no
longer
living
whether
it's
cotton,
wheat,
tobacco
or
poultry.
the
commission's
ruling
is
--
ignores
the
source
of
the
exemption
and
it
represents
a
mere
speculative
inference
as
to
what
it
would
have
been
logically
for
congress
to
have
provide
it.
i
submit
that
this
is
very
treacherous
ground
for
statutory
interpretation.
it
seems
to
me,
if
we
are
to
consider
that
question,
that
there
is
sufficient
differences
between
the
manifold
products
and
byproducts
resulting
from
slaughter
of
cattle,
sheep,
and
swine
with
reference
to
transporting
these
products
from
the
point
of
slaughter
and
exemption
of
transportation
of
poultry
which
has
been
prepared
for
market
merely
by
being
killed,
feathered
and
cleaned.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
couldn't
answer
that
question
because
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
would
think
so.
i
haven't
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
don't
know
that
fact.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
certainly
is
not
in
the
record.
it
--
there
may
be
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
would
not
question
that
--
i
--
but
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
you
are
now
talking
as
between
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
meats
--
meats
and
poultry.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
exemption
does
not
cover
meats.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
was
just
raising
the
question.
i
was
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
think
that
it's
certainly
--
it
--
we
know
almost
to
the
matter
of
judicial
notice
that
slaughtering
plants
are,
in
the
first
place,
the
public
ones
that
are
subject
to
--
are
regulated
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
the
number
is,
it
said,
it's
what
you
might
call
a
large
business.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
it
said
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
that
unquestionably
is
so
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
as
i
say,
i
do
not
know
the
figures
on
that
and
none
of
the
briefs
to
my
knowledge
have
given
any
figures
on
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
think
it
started
with
agricultural
products
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
no.
it's
--
it
started
with
livestock
and
unprocessed
agricultural
products.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
then
--
no,
wait
--
should
go
on.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
started
by
the
house
committee
just
had
the
words
livestock
and
unprocessed
agricultural
products.on
the
floor
of
the
house,
they
took
out
the
word
unprocessed
and
added
the
words
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof.they
also
added
the
provision
about
fish.
