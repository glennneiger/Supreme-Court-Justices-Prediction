is
there
any
difference
in
the
notice
to
parties
so
that
the
parties
you
called
upon
to
attend
one
of
those
hearings
for
declaratory
order
or
what
was
done
here?
justice
harold
burton
and
here,
it
was
just
a
notice
to
the
public,
was
it,
or
--
justice
harold
burton
may
i
ask
you
if
the
same
--
justice
harold
burton
--
question
of
statutory
interpretation
is
involved
in
both.
justice
harold
burton
precisely
the
same?
justice
harold
burton
you
get
nothing
more
decided
if
you
get
--
so
far
as
the
statutory
interpretations
if
you
get
that
determined.
justice
harold
burton
oh
you
mean
that
one
of
them
decides
poultry
and
one
meat,
you
--
you
won't
get
both
question
decided
in
one
case.
