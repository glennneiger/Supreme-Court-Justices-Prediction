mr.
david
g.
macdonald
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i've
yielded
most
of
my
time
to
mr.
ginnane,
i'm
going
to
have
to
limit
myself
to
one
or
two
points
which
i
feel
may
be
helpful
to
the
court
in
approaching
the
problem
of
construction
of
the
section
which
is
involved
in
the
complaint
case.
i
am
representing
in
this
proceeding
the
various
motor
carriers
who
initiated
the
action
by
filing
a
--
a
complaint
before
the
commission
alleging
that
frozen
food
express
was
violating
the
certificate
and
the
rate
provisions
of
the
act
by
transporting
these
commodities
without
having
a
certificate
and
without
having
rates
on
file.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
difference
between
fresh
poultry
and
frozen
poultry
is
very
slight
in
actual
rates.
the
difference
between
the
rates
on
poultry,
when
transported
under
commission
regulation
and
the
rates
on
poultry
when
transported
as
an
exempt
commodity,
are
appreciable.
in
another
words,
the
whole
scope
of
this
--
of
this
proceeding,
so
far
as
regulated
transportation
is
concerned,
is
that
the
principle
which
the
department
of
agriculture
has
urged
below
and
which
the
secretary
and
the
united
states
now
urged
this
court
visit
the
policy
implicit
in
the
exemption
provision
should
be
considered
paramount
to
the
policy
of
congress
in
providing
a
complete
system
of
regulation.
it's
the
same
issue
that
was
before
this
court
in
a
leasing
case
a
few
years
ago,
that's
344
u.s.when
the
secretary
of
agriculture
urged
that
the
commission's
regulation
of
leasing
practices
should
be
declared
improper
because
there
was
secondary
effect
on
the
availability
of
trucks
to
farmers.
we
believe
that
the
farmers
entitled
to
the
largest
possible
interpretation
of
this
section,
but
it
should
stop
short
of
being
extended
to
the
benefit
of
commercial
practice.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
--
in
the
brief
of
united
states
at
page
7
suggested
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
extend
this
exemption
provision
to
the
--
the
processors,
the
commercial
handlers
of
these
raw
farm
products
after
they
convert
them
into
food
products
because
there
might
be
some
increase
in
price
to
the
farmer
if
there
is
some
lessening
of
the
cost
along
with
distribution
chain.
and
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court
today.
which
of
these
two
conflicting
policies
should
be
considered
to
be
the
controlling
intention
or
where
shall
the
court
draw
the
line
between
them
in
looking
at
this
language
of
this
section
and
trying
to
find
what
the
intention
of
congress
was.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
well,
i
don't
ask
the
court
to
go
beyond
the
rules
of
--
of
the
interpretation
and
construction
that
the
court
has
made
clear
and
i
think
47
columbia
law
review
is
one
of
the
best
guides
that
i
found
in
my
research
as
to
the
principles.
i
simply
say,
the
starting
with
the
language
of
this
provision,
which
resulted
from
amendments
from
the
floor,
and
therefore
don't
show
any
clear
cohesive
interpretation
which
don't
include
any
definition
of
section
which
will
be
found
for
example
in
the
price
control
acts
in
which
there
is
a
similar
provision
that
is
necessary
to
resort
to
extrinsic
aids.
without
laboring
the
point,
we
have
pointed
out
that
those
extrinsic
aids
include
both
the
legislative
history
prior
to
the
act
in
which
the
intention
of
congress
or
its
purpose
in
providing
regulation
is
made
clear
and
also
its
purpose
in
extending
to
farmers,
the
aid
in
getting
their
products
to
market
of
not
having
to
use
the
ordinary
commercial
means
of
transportation
can
be
reconciled
through
an
understanding
of
the
fundamental
basis
on
which
they
approach
this
legislation.
secondly,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
help
to
be
found
in
what
we
call
contemporaries
usage
of
these
terms.
there
is
no
issue
in
the
case
of
what
dressed
poultry
is
not
a
farm
product
when
it
is
dressed
and
when
it
is
frozen.
these
two
different
commodities
are
recognized
by
the
parties
as
being
primarily
the
production
of
commercial
packets.
so,
in
looking
at
the
literal
definitions
which
have
been
urged
on
the
commission
and
on
the
court
below
and
now
in
this
court,
for
interpretation
of
this
language
and
particularly
the
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
the
meaning
of
manufacturing,
we
have
a
situation
where
a
tax
statute
in
richmond,
virginia,
for
example,
can
say
that
--
that
meat
cutting
is
not
manufacturing
and
yet
we
can
look
at
a
federal
statute
and
we
can
look
at
a
classification
manual
in
the
federal
government's
usage
and
find
that
meat
cutting
is
manufacturing.
so,
again,
i
say
we
have
not
a
clear
question,
not
anything
that
can
be
solved
by
resort
to
dictionary
definitions.
in
our
brief
and
in
the
transcript,
we
set
forth
the
evidence
which
was
offered
to
the
commission
in
the
complaint
case
which
was
not
before
the
commission
except
in
part
in
the
determination
case,
showing
that
since
1929,
in
the
nra
codes
and
in
classification
indicia
which
the
government
departments'
organized
for
statistical
purposes,
meat
cutting
and
the
meat
--
the
processing
industry
and
the
poultry
processing
industry
have
been
classified
as
manufacturing
enterprises.
now,
i
am
not
here
to
state
that
the
congressman
who
offered
that
amendment
from
the
floor
knew
that.
i
am
saying,
however,
there
was
a
contemporaneous
usage
which
squares
with
the
idea
that
when
they
changed
the
word
"processed"
to
manufactured,
they
were
not
intending
to
extend
that
agricultural
exemption
to
the
meat
packing
industry.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
believe
so
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
actual
percentage
is
somewhere
around
4%.
that
was
the
information
on
meat
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
--
that
is
processed
by
--
by
the
farmer.
actually
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
actually
it's
not
the
farmer,
it's
the
long
island
duck
association,
other
cooperative
organizations
but
by
the
grower.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
a
--
as
to
poultry
and
--
and
meat,
i
think
it's
about
the
same.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
greatest
poultry
--
part
of
the
poultry
industry
is
what
is
now
known
as
the
broiler
industry
centered
in
the
delmarva
peninsula
across
the
chesapeake
bay
and
in
georgia
and
other
sections
where
the
birds
are
raised
in
large
broiler
houses
and
go
in
a
truck
operated
by
the
--
usually
by
the
packer,
two
packing
plant
and
the
birds
come
out
as
broilers
and
fryers
and
so
on.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
reason
that
the
--
this
case
as
before
the
court
starts
with
the
kroblin
case
which
is
the
only
basis
for
the
court's
decision
below
and
the
poultry
should
be
classified
as
exempt.
the
kroblin
was
brought
in
iowa
where
there
is
a
different
kind
of
chicken
production.
there,
the
chickens
would
go
to
market
for
meat
purposes
are
the
(inaudible)
and
the
surplus
females
from
the
farm
flocks
which
are
maintained
for
egg
raising
purposes.
so
that
we
had
a
farm
there
which
was
perhaps
not
complete
universal
in
its
understanding
of
the
problem.
finally,
i
wish
to
make
this
one
final
point,
if
i
may.
we've
had
a
big
question
as
--
as
to
what
congress
has
done
since
this
problem
arose
and
one
side
contends
and
the
kroblin
decision
rests
almost
entirely
on
the
proposition
that
congress
felt
that
the
commission's
decision
was
to
hold
that
poultry
was
exempt
and
that
the
congress
has
ratified
that
by
refusing
to
make
a
change
in
the
act.
actually,
such
--
such
help
as
we
can
get
on
the
doctrine,
a
ratification
by
congress
is
i
think
very
important
because
as
shown
in
our
brief,
the
congress
was
advised
in
1950,
1952
twice,
that
the
commission
was
holding
poultry
to
be
a
regulated
commodity,
not
within
the
scope
of
the
exemption.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
is
represented
as
congress
specifically
to
change
the
act
so
as
to
make
poultry
exempt
and
congress
did
amend
the
act
to
add
the
phrase
and
horticultural,
the
parenthetical
phrase
that
appears
right
after
agriculture,
that
was
the
amendment
1952
or
1953
after
this
was
--
was
made
known
to
them
in
public
hearings
by
then
which
the
commission's
spokesman
as
a
witness,
secretary
of
agriculture
had
a
spokesman
who
was
a
witness,
and
i,
unfortunately,
was
also
a
witness
because
i
found
myself
misquoted
in
the
kroblin
decision
and
the
result
of
it
was
congress
ratified
the
decision
of
the
commission
by
refusing
to
change
the
act
and
leaving
poultry
under
regulation.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
recognized
that
that
is
true,
but
in
recalling
certain
language
of
the
court
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
remember
that
the
reason
why
that
congress
didn't
usually
know
what
had
happened,
well
in
this
instance,
the
congress
did
know
what
had
happened.
for
these
reasons,
and
i
regret
that
that
we
can't
go
more
into
them
orally,
but
i
think
they
are
fully
expressed
in
the
brief
on
all
sides,
we
feel
that
the
court
should
reverse
with
respect
to
the
dressed
poultry,
and
if
it
does
so,
it
will
have
an
opportunity
or
even
if
it
doesn't
to
clarify
a
problem
which
has
resulted
in
about
six
lower
court
decisions
going
off
on
different
grounds
and
if
the
determination
case
is
reversed,
it
will
also
be
the
vehicle
whereby
the
general
scope
of
these
exemption
provision
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
act
as
a
whole,
may
be
made
available
for
understanding
on
a
broader
basis
and
it
has
been
true
in
the
past.
thank
you.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
mr.
phinney
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
thing
i
was
referring
to
is
an
article
on
how
to
reinspect
this
(inaudible)
i
don't
remember
the
exact
page
but
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
believe
that's
correct.
