mr.
ginnane
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
to
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
ginnane,
with
--
with
the
matter
standing
as
it
did
when
that
order
was
--
was
made,
what
liabilities
are
frozen
foods
subjected
to?
i
suppose
they
don't
pay
attention
to
this
order
and
go
ahead
and
--
and
carry
these
commodities,
what
--
what
kind
of
issues
are
they
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
how
--
how
would
the
criminal
penalties
be
invoked
against
it,
is
it
immediately
subject
to
criminal
penalties
or
--
or
must
there
first
be
some
other
proceeding
before
the
board
in
the
cease
and
desist
order
or
something
of
that
kind,
can
--
can
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
on
the
basis
of
this
order
alone,
bring
criminal
prosecution
against
the
frozen
foods?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
reccess
now.
mr.
ginnane,
you
may
proceed
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
livestock,
livestock
when
it's
butchered
and
frozen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i
was
asking
if
--
if
when
they
use
livestock
and
agricultural
products
to
commodities,
i
was
wondering
if
that
did
have
much
significance
because
it
is
butchered
the
beef,
the
frozen
livestock.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
that
come
under
the
same
category
then
as
--
as
chickens
that
were
--
that
were
slaughtered
and
dismembered
and
frozen
the
same
as
beef.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
court
--
court
held
differently.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macdonald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phinney
do
you
agree
with
mr.
ginnane
that
you
are
now
subject
to
similar
penalties
without
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
asked
that
was
that
i
--
i
read
your
complaint
not
this
afternoon,
but
earlier
and
i
--
i
didn't
think
you
mentioned
criminal
penalties.
i
think
you
said
you
were
subject
to
injunction
but
i
didn't
recall
if
you
said
you
were
also
subject
to
criminal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
any
other
intervening
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weston.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
distinction
in
your
opinion
between
dressed
chicken
and
dressed
beef?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
they
have
to
be
derived
from
a
different
source?
if
--
if
poultry
can
come
under
agriculture,
why
can't
--
why
can't
beef?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
reason
why
fresh
meat
would
have
to
come
under
that
livestock
exemption,
why
couldn't
it
come
under
agriculture
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
the
same
as
poultry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
just
asking
if
in
your
opinion,
was
any
distinction
between
--
difference
between
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
district
court
have
any
information
that
we
don't
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
gave
the
one
conclusion
in
regard
to
chickens
and
another
one
as
to
meat,
do
they
have
any
information
we
don't
have?
