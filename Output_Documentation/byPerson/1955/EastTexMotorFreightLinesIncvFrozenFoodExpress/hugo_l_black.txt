justice
hugo
l.
black
of
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
you
leave
the
other
subject,
which
--
which
part
is
or
depending
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
insofar
as
the
jurisdictional
questions
is
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
two
complaints
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
has
been
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
has
been
acted
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
and
if
that's
it,
is
there
any
difference
at
all
in
the
merits
that
would
have
be
to
be
decided
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
two
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
provided
you
reach
the
merits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
precisely
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
differences?
i
wonder
that
there's
--
are
there
as
many
--
are
the
poultry
places
where
they
kill
it
typical
--
then
widely
distributed,
or
more
widely
distributing
in
the
packing
plant
that
prepared
meat
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
more
--
are
there
more
of
them
located
in
the
--
close
to
the
place
where
they
raise
the
chicken.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't,
you
haven't
--
you
don't
know
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
little
surprised
of
the
statement
that
--
that
have
many
percentage,
is
it
not,
or
4%
only
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
farmers
or
the
poultry
people
themselves
have
anything
to
do
with
killing
and
slaughtering
and
selling
to
the
market.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
might
--
it's
not
in
the
record
and
it
must
be
correct.
i
am
sure
that
he
had
some
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
basic
object
of
providing
this
exemption?
what
--
what
reasons
are
there
that
would
make
it
more
or
less
applicable
to
one
of
these
two
than
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
poultry
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
fowl
chickens
and
other
fowls,
and
packed
in
the
curbed
parts
of
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
i'm
not
thinking
of
that.
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i
did
some
--
didn't
the
object
was
to
make
it
helpful
to
the
farmer
to
process
and
that
there
might
be
something
to
the
fact
that
having
open
comparative
shipment
of
chicken
and
chicken
products
even
when
they
are
killed
would
give
the
farmers
more
or
less
advantage
than
it
would
do
have
competitive
transportation
of
the
products
that
were
meat
packed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
differences
in
sizes
of
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
distribution
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
any
other
thing
in
the
record
that
shows
why
they
use
the
word
agricultural
product
instead
of
naming
the
--
continuing
to
name
the
particular
where
the
exemptions
were
to
be
granted
or
not
grated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
as
the
livestock
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
livestock
and
beef
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
are
agricultural
commodities
including
(inaudible)
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof.
