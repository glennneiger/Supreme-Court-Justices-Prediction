it
please
the

in
all
our
seven
numbered
appeals
before
the
court,
they
really
amount
to
only
two
cases.
numbers
158
to
161
are
referred
to
by
the
parties
as
the
determination
case,
and
it
involves
the
single
question
of
whether
the
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
a
proceeding
entitled
determination
of
exempted
agricultural
commodities
is
reviewable
by
the
courts.
numbers
162
to
164
are
referred
to
by
the
parties
as
the
complaint
case,
and
it
involves
the
single
question
of
whether
fresh
and
frozen
dressed
poultry
are
exempt
agricultural
commodities
under
section
203
(b)
(6).
i
will
make
the
sole
argument
for
the
appellants
in
numbers
159
and
160
in
the
determination
case.
and
mr.
macdonald
and
i
will
divide
the
argument
for
appellants
in
the
complaint
case.
i
should
state
that
appellant,
railroads,
have
filed
their
own
brief
but
are
not
participating
in
the
oral
argument.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
nobody
on
this
side
of
the
table.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
i
may
discuss
the
determination
case
first,
which
involves
the
single
question
of
whether
the
commission's
decision
in
that
case
is
a
reviewable
order.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
begins
in
the
record
in
number
158
at
page
30.
it
runs
from
page
30
to
page
102.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
it's
concentrated
in
--
in
the
findings,
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
88
and
running
almost
to
the
bottom
of
page
89.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
88,
the
commission
sets
forth
its
general
principle
or
test
for
determining
whether
particular
commodity
is
exempt
or
not
exempt.
and
then
following
full
paragraph
on
page
89,
it
sets
forth
a
--
a
long
list
of
commodities
which
it
has
concluded
are
exempt
as
agricultural
commodities.
now,
i
should
also
add
that
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
discussion
in
its
report,
the
commission
states
at
various
places
in
its
judgment
specific
commodities
such
as
dressed
poultry
are
not
exempt
commodities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
different
portions
of
the
preceding
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
then
in
other
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
more
specific
than
that.
during
the
--
at
various
points
in
the
discussion,
the
commission
expressly
states
its
conclusion
that
named
commodities
are
non-exempt.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
they
added
nothing
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
added
no
such
directly
operated
language.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
make
the
argument
easier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
but
a
little
later,
i
shall
like
to
point
out
that
in
its
practical
impact
upon
the
transportation
industry,
they
have
--
the
people
in
the
industry
had
no
doubt
as
to
--
as
to
what
the
practical
consequences
were
in
terms
of
the
need
or
lack
of
need
for
obtaining
certificates
of
public
convenience
necessity
or
the
need
or
lack
of
need
for
filing
rates
and
tariffs.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
as
i
shall
like
to
point
out
in
more
detail
later
on,
we
think
that
a
distinguishing
factor
between
what
the
commission
has
done
here
and
the
huge
mass
of
informal
administrative
determinations
which
everybody
can
seize
are
not
and
should
not
be
reviewable.
because
what
the
commission
did
here
was
done
after
a
formal
hearing,
the
--
the
result
of
a
formal
proceeding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
just
the
--
this
enumeration
of
commodities
which
the
commission
had
held
to
be
exempt
or
not
exempt
as
the
case
may
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
it
is
about
at
page
29,
yes,
on
page
29,
page
29
of
the
record
in
number
158.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
department
of
justice.
the
two
briefs
filed
on
behalf
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
printed
in
--
with
the
blue
cover.
i
like
to
go
back
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
this
part
by
--
this
part
is
meant
part
ii
which
is
the
whole
system
of
regulation
with
respect
to
motor
carriers,
requirements
for
certificates,
filing
of
rates
and
tariffs.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
your
honor
i
think
i'd
put
a
--
the
203
(b)
(6)
provides
an
exemption
from
all
of
--
from
all
of
the
economic
rights
and
duties
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
does
indeed
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
the
background
of
the
determination
can
be
summarized
very
briefly.
what
is
now
part
ii
originated
as
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
and
almost
immediately
after
its
enactment,
there
arose
many
questions
as
to
what
commodities
were
or
were
not
exempted
agricultural
commodities.
the
issue
arose
as
to
many
commodities
and
arose
in
informal
administrative
determinations,
informal
commission
decisions
and
it
was
a
subject
of
repeated
litigations.
the
unhappy
result
was
that,13
years
later
in
1948,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
confusion
and
uncertainty
as
to
the
scope
of
this
important
exemption.
now,
in
1948
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
other
persons
had
made
fundamental
objections
to
the
commission's
holding
in
the
so-called
harwood
case,
that
vegetables
which
had
been
washed,
cleaned
and
packaged
were
not
exempt
as
agricultural
commodities.
responding
to
those
representations,
the
commission
reopened
the
harwood
case.
in
addition,
by
the
order
which
--
which
appears
on
page
29
of
this
record,
the
commission
directed
the
investigation
and
i
quote
“be
made
into
and
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
words
agricultural
commodity
and
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof.”
at
the
same
time,
the
commission
directed
that
a
hearing
be
held
and
to
publish
notice
of
the
hearing
in
the
federal
register.
in
brief,
after
13
years
of
confusion
and
litigation
and
interpretation
on
a
case
to
case
and
commodity
to
commodity
basis,
the
commission
sought
to
arrive
at
an
informed
and
consistent
interpretation
applying
section
203
(b)
(6)
to
agricultural
commodities
as
a
group.
so,
early
in
1948,
--
late
in
1948
and
early
in
1949,
extensive
hearings
were
held
before
a
hearing
examiner
who
received
voluminous
evidence
from
representatives,
the
department
of
agriculture,
and
many
other
interested
parties.
and
after
an
examiner's
report
and
oral
argument
before
the
full
commission,
the
commission
in
1951
issued
its
decision
in
this
determination
proceeding.
now,
the
report
consists
first
of
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
agricultural
exemption
and
commission
resorts
extensively
to
accept
its
sources
of
interpretative
material
in
dictionaries,
decisions
with
the
court,
particularly
this
court.
and
the
commission's
report
includes
an
--
an
extensive
commodity
by
commodity
discussion
of
the
various
processes
and
treatments
which
are
applied
in
the
different
agricultural
commodities.
now,
the
order
at
the
end
of
the
determination
proceeding
did
not
direct
named
persons
to
do
or
not
to
do
anything.
as
set
forth
at
page
101
of
the
record,
it
simply
recites
that
full
investigation
of
the
matters
and
things
involved
has
been
made
that
the
commission
on
the
date
hereof
has
made
and
filed
its
report
on
oral
argument
herein
containing
it's
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions.
and
it
has
ordered
that
the
proceeding
being
adhered
by
is
discontinued.
in
1954,
frozen
food
express
–-
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they're
subject
to
civil
and
criminal
penalties.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
what
the
--
what
the
commission
would
do,
at
least
what
it
has
done
in
some
cases,
that
has
brought
cease
and
desist
proceedings
as
it
did
in
the
companion
frozen
food
case
and
the
violation
of
that
cease
and
desist
order
would
be
the
basis
for
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
could
arise
in
another
fashion,
the
--
the
commission
could
win
the
court
in
a
civil
proceeding
for
an
injunction
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
enjoin
and
contend
the
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
--
when
the
commission
issues
rules,
it
ordinarily
will
set
them
up
in
a
form
out
of
rules,
they'll
usually
be
entitle
rules
or
regulations
relating
to
such
and
such
subject
like
three
pleasing
rules
which
were
before
this
court
in
the
american
trucking
association's
case
and
will
publish
them
in
the
federal
register
as
required
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
this
--
in
this
case,
the
commission
did
not
publish
in
the
federal
register
rather
it
published
the
--
its
report
in
the
determination
case
with
its
orders
in
the
--
in
the
printed
volume
of
its
orders,
it
seemed
that
--
at
least
this
regards
the
mechanics,
the
processing
of
the
result
of
the
proceeding,
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
treated
it
as
an
order
rather
than
as
rules
in
the
conventional
sense.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
received
additional
evidence
in
--
in
this
companion
cease
and
desist
proceeding.
although
the
evidence
largely
paralleled
or
duplicated
the
commission
with
the
evidence
which
had
been
presented
to
the
commission
in
the
--
in
the
determination
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
actually
in
that
case,
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
stipulation
by
the
parties.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
certainly
it
is.
so
this
litigation
over
the
determination
case
began
in
1954
on
frozen
foods
express
which
is
a
motor
carrier
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
filed
complaints
in
the
district
court
in
texas.
frozen
foods
express
contented
in
its
complaint
that
the
commission
had
erred
in
classifying
about
30
commodities
as
non-exempt.
that
complaint
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
alleged
that
the
commissioner
had
erred
in
classifying
eight
specified
commodities
as
non
exempt.
the
united
states,
through
the
department
of
agriculture,
supported
--
the
united
states
through
the
department
of
justice
supported
the
position
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
and
various
rail
and
motor
carriers
intervened
in
support
of
the
commission's
order.
now,
the
district
court,
as
your
honors
know,
did
not
go
into
the
merits
and
to
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
decision
in
the
determination
case
at
all.it
may
in
just
one
holding
that
the
commission's
decision
in
the
determination
case
was
not
a
reviewable
order.
and
in
--
and
in
coming
to
that
conclusion,
the
district
court
relied
primarily
upon
this
court's
decision
in
the
los
angeles
and
salt
lake
railroad
case
in
273
u.s.,
in
which
this
court
held
that
in
order
of
the
commission
of
placing
a
value,
a
valuation
upon
railroad
property
was
not
subject
to
review.
and
the
district
court
seem
to
rely
heavily
upon
the
classical
language
from
the
los
angeles
case
that
the
so-called
order
here
complained
of
is
one
which
does
not
command
the
carrier
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
doing
anything.
now,
our
position
here
is
that
the
commission's
determination
in
this
case
is
distinguishable
and
its
practical
impact
from
the
valuation
order
which
was
involved
in
the
los
angeles
case,
and
thus
distinguished,
we
think,
it
is
reviewable
under
more
recent
developments
in
the
law
of
review
since
the
los
angeles
case.
now,
comparing
the
practical
impact
of
the
two
types
of
agency
action,
the
valuation
order
in
the
los
angeles
case,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
could
have
had
no
practical
impact
until
there
was
a
raid
or
some
other
kind
of
proceeding
before
the
commission.
and
this
court
noted
specifically
that,
in
the
los
angeles
case,
it
is
--
it
is
at
least
possible
that
no
proceeding
will
ever
be
instituted
either
before
the
commission
or
at
court
in
which
the
matter
is
now
complained
of
will
be
involved
or
in
which
the
errors
alleged
will
be
of
legal
significance.
and
similarly,
the
evaluation
order
involved
in
that
case
did
not
leave
any
carrier
even
threatened
with
criminal
penalties.
by
contrast
in
the
determination
case,
the
commissioner's
decision
told
motor
carriers
that
they
would
be
subject
to
criminal
and
civil
enforcement
proceedings
if
they
carried
commodities
which
the
commission
classified
as
non-exempt
without
obtaining
appropriate
certificates
or
permits
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
the
total
motor
carriers
designed
to
carry
such
certificates
that
they
must
go
to
the
expense
in
the
inconvenience,
and
i
regret
to
say,
considerable
period
of
time
involved
in
obtaining
appropriate
certificates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
much
of
part
ii
is
involved
depending
upon
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right
sir
--
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
--
is
it
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
it
could
have
been
done.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
--
but
we
don't
contend
that
the
absence
of
a
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
of
a
few
formal
sentences
should
not
determine
the
issue
of
reviewability.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
the
practical
impact
is
the
same
upon
the
person
subject
to
regulation
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
with
the
passage
of
time
through
the
years,
it's
become
quite
important
to
the
transport
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
in
--
in
support
of
what
your
honor
says,
i
think
--i
think
of
the
american
broadcasting
case
last
term,
a
slight
difference
in
language,
apparently
had
the
result
but
no
one
ever
raised
a
question
of
reviewability.
and
we
think
the
volume
of
actual
litigation
that
has
occurred
since
1935
underlines
sharply
the
practical
impact
of
--
of
the
commission's
determination
of
this
--
of
the
scope
of
the
agricultural
commodity
exemption.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
somebody
may
want
to
carry
these
commodities;
hundreds
of
people
are
already
carrying
with
or
without
certificates.
the
commodities
involved
in
--in
the
commission's
determination
of
exempted
agricultural
commodity.
and
depending
upon
where
a
particular
commodity
is
classified
as
exempt
or
not
exempt
that
has
competitive
consequences
for
those
people.
if
a
commodity
is
classified
as
nonexempt,
that
tells
the
people
who
are
carrying
it
that
they
are
some
--
that
if
--
if
they
don't
have
certificates,
they've
got
to
obtain
them
or
get
out
of
the
business.
if
a
commodity
is
classified
as
exempt,
it
tells
--
it
tells
the
carriers
who
handle
that
commodity
that
they
are
subject
to
unlimited,
unrestrained
competition,
both
as
to
entry
into
the
business
and
as
to
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh
no,
some
--
some
carriers
disagree.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
had
been
a
--
there
had
been
a
number
of
cease
and
desist
proceedings
both
before
and
since
the
determination.
it's
been
a
subject
to
litigation
and
controversy
from
the
day
the
act
became
effective,
it
still
is.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
such
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
as
columbia
broadcasting
system
v.united
states
and
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee
versus
mcgrath
stand
for
the
proposition
that
is
the
substance
of
administrative
action.
and
not
the
--
not
the
precise
label
that's
placed
upon
it
that
determines
whether
it's
reviewable.
and
it
seemed
to
us
that
those
decisions
also
hold
that
under
some
circumstances,
persons
may
obtain
review
of
agency
action
which
isn't
immediately
addressed
to
them
at
all,
which
should
not,
in
terms,
require
such
persons
to
do
or
not
to
do
anything.
that's
the
practical
impact
of
the
order
which
determines
reviewability.
now,
we
think
the
act,
the
interstate
commerce
act,
clearly
empowers
the
commission
to
issue
formal
interpretations
of
--
of
such
phrases
as
agricultural
commodities
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof.
because
section
204
specifically
provides
that
the
commission
shall
administer,
execute
and
enforce
all
provisions
of
this
part
and
empowers
it
to
make
all
necessary
orders
and
connection
therewith
and
to
prescribe
rules,
regulations
and
procedure
for
such
administration.
in
federal
communications
commission,
the
american
broadcasting
company
in
347
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
on
almost
identical
grant
of
rule
making
power,
almost
verbatim,
empowered
the
federal
communications
commission
to
issue
what
were
labeled
as
interpretative
rules
in
purporting
to
interpret
a
criminal
--
lottery
provision
of
the
criminal
code.
and
it
was
stated
in
these
interpretative
regulations
of
fcc,
i
think
that
that
--
that
that
commission
would
use
them
as
a
guide
in
--
in
the
exercise
of
its
license
--
licensing
powers
and
particularly
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
review,
to
renew
or
not
to
review
broadcast
licenses.
and
in
that
case,
the
--
the
interpretative
regulations,
labeled
as
such,
issued
by
the
communications
commission
after
a
hearing,
were
reviewed
by
a
three-judge
district
court
and
by
this
court.
in
the
suit
upon
injunction,
or
without
any
actual
attempt
at
enforcement
of
the
regulations,
either
criminally
or
in
actual
licensing
proceedings,
and
in
event,
the
case
stands
for
the
proposition
we
believe
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
under
a
similar
statutory
provision,
has
been
authorized
by
congress
to
issue
interpretations
of
the
act.
now,
we
don't
think
it
should
be
decisive
whether
the
commission's
decision
in
the
--
in
the
interpretation
case
is
labeled
as
a
rule
or
as
an
order.
but
the
significant
thing
is
the
practical
impact
upon
the
person
subject
to
regulation.
at
the
same
time,
i'd
like
to
repeat
that
it
is
an
important
thing
that
a
line
be
drawn
between
the
mass
of
informal
administrative
interpretations
and
reviewable
decisions
or
interpretations.
we
think
that
a
--
a
line
which
fits
here
is
the
line
drawn
by
section
5
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
empowers
administrative
agencies
under
certain
conditions
to
issue
declaratory
orders.
we
submit
that
the
commission's
decision
in
the
determination
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess,
and
i
had
just
started
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
analogy
which
we
believe
supports
reviewability
of
the
determination
of
declaratory
orders
under
section
5
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
section
5
(d),
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
at
pages
28
and
29,
provides
that
in
every
case
of
adjudication
required
by
statute
to
be
determined
on
the
record
after
opportunity
for
an
agency
hearing,
the
agency
is
authorized
in
its
sound
discretion
with
like
affect
as
in
the
case
of
other
orders
to
issue
a
declaratory
order
to
terminate
a
controversy
or
remove
uncertainty.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
page
28
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir,
page
28
of
the
commission's
main
brief.
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
28
and
continues
in
the
top
of
page
29.
now,
the
commission
has
the
power
and
the
duty
to
interpret
and
--
and
apply
the
agricultural
commodity
exemption
in
two
types
of
cases
of
adjudication
within
the
meaning
of
the
procedure
act
in
which
a
hearing
is
required
the,
first,
cease
and
desist
proceedings,
and
secondly,
in
determining
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
scope
and
application
of
the
agricultural
commodity
exception,
which
the
commission
has
authorized
by
statue
to
determine
after
a
hearing
in
two
types
of
cases,
is
an
issue
which
the
commission
is
empowered
by
section
5
(d)
of
the
procedure
act
to
determine
in
a
declaratory
order.
even
assuming
what
section
5
(d)
does
not
make
to
clear,
but
assuming
that
a
declaratory
order
may
be
issued
only
after
a
hearing,
well
then
in
this
case,
the
commission
held
a
hearing,
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
it
issued
--
before
it
made
its
decision
in
determination
case.
and
the
clear
purpose
of
the
determination,
after
13
years
of
uncertainty,
it
clearly
was
to
terminate
controversies
and
to
remove
uncertainties.
the
legislative
history
of
section
5
(d)
of
the
procedure
act
is
quite
sparse.
it
indicates
only
that
was
generally
modeled
upon
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
the
report
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
does
states
specifically
that
such
orders
wouldn't
be
subject
to
judicial
review
as
in
the
case
of
other
orders.
that's
about
the
only
legislatively
history
of
the
procedure
act
throws
on
section
5
(d).
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
that
is
--
that
is
a
general
grant
of
power
to
the
commission
to
issue
orders
and
rules
in
the
administration
of
the
motor
carrier
provisions.
now,
that's
a
general
power,
it
doesn't
specifically
deal
with
the
subject
of
declaratory
orders,
whereas
section
5
(d),
which
is
applicable
to
interstate
commerce
commission
as
it
is
to
other
agencies,
does
deal
specifically
with
the
subject
of
declaratory
order.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
those
were
--
that
was
a
rule-making
proceeding
labelled
as
such
and
--
and
what
emerged
in
that
proceeding
was
in
the
form
of
rules
and
labor
rules.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
here
the
commission
at
no
point
said
that
it
was
issuing
rules
and
i
have
to
state
frankly
that
what
--
what
the
commission
did
here
was
not
in
the
format
in
which
it
usually
would
put
rules
of
general
applicability.
now,
we
do
submit
here
that
the
fact
that
the
commission
did
not
label
what
it
did
as
a
declaratory
order
is
not
conclusive,
that
if,
in
fact,
it
amounted
to
a
declaratory
order,
and
we
think
it
did,
then
it
should
be
reviewable
just
as
much
as
though
the
commission
had
said
this
is
a
declaratory
order
issued
under
section
5
(d).
now,
the
court
below
put
a
good
deal
of
wing
on
the
fact
that
the
order
which
the
--
which
the
commission
issued
at
the
close
of
the
determination
proceeding
was
one
discontinuing
the
proceeding.
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
few
cases
in
which
the
commission
has
issued
what
it
labeled
as
declaratory
orders
under
section
5
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
has
used
exactly
the
same
technique
at
the
end
of
the
procedure.
it
has
issued
a
report
in
which
it
issued
the
interpretation
which
had
been
requested
applying
some
provision
of
the
statute
to
a
particular
set
of
facts,
that
appears
in
the
commission's
report.
and
then
in
such
declaratory
order
cases,
the
commission
issues
an
order
as
it
did
here,
saying,
we
have
considered
the
matter,
we
have
arrived
at
our
conclusion
and
we
the
only
ordering
words
are
words
which
state
that
the
proceeding
is
hereby
discontinued.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
two
particular
declaratory
order
cases
i
have
in
mind,
they
were
requested
by
single
individuals.
only
one
individual
was
involved
in
each
of
them.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
here,
it
was
a
notice
to
the
public,
because
of
its
impact,
possible
impact
upon
--
well,
conservatively
many
hundreds
of
carriers,
and
i
don't
--
i
--
i
would
not
know
how
many
thousands
of
producers
and
shippers
of
agricultural
commodities.
a
general
pubic
notice
would
be
the
only
possible
way
of
providing
an
opportunity
for
everyone
of
a
legitimate
interest
to
participate
in
a
proceeding.
it
was
--
here,
it
was
a
notice
published
in
the
federal
registry.
so
in
brief,
our
--
our
argument
on
the
reviewability
of
the
determination
is
that
if
interpretative
rules
issued
after
a
hearing
as
in
the
american
broadcasting
case,
or
if
an
interpretation
embodied
in
the
form
of
a
declaratory
order
is
reviewable,
as
we
think
it
is,
then
what
the
commission
did
here
measured
by
its
practical
impact
upon
the
--
upon
the
person
subject
to
regulation
is
--
is
also
reviewed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
think
--
i
think
a
--
a
reading
of
the
determination
as
a
whole
would
indicate
to
him
as
that
the
order
discontinuing
the
proceeding
was
just
a
mechanical
order
which
closed
out
the
commission's
docket
leaving
it
to
interpretation
of
the
statue
sternly.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
court
had
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
--
but
the
--
the
court
below
was
not
left
as
--
as
i
read
its
decision.
it
was
not
left
with
the
thought
that
the
commission
hadn't
--
had
--
had
gone
through
this
long
and
expensive
proceeding
just
for
fun
or
that
having
--
or
that
it
was
abandoning
the
--
the
conclusion
to
which
i've
arrived
at.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
did
with
--
the
commission
with
--
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
--
it
tells
the
motor
carrier
industry
how
the
commission
will
apply
the
exemption
and
the
exercise
of
its
licensing
functions
and
in
the
exercise
of
its
--
of
its
enforcement
powers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
can
--
they
can
attack
it
but
in
some
situations,
he
will
do
it
at
his
own
risks.
now,
i
think
before
the
intermission,
i
--
i
may
have
misled
the
court
to
some
extent.
i
believe
i
told
the
court
that
a
criminal
proceeding
would
rely
only
for
violation
of
a
cease
and
desist
order.
if
i
did
state
that,
it
was
incorrect.
a
--
a
criminal
enforcement
proceeding
rely
for
violation
of
the
act.
so
--
so,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
cease
and
desist
order
as
the
basis
for
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
there
has
been
--
there
has
been
several
prosecutions
of
carriers
for
carrying
commodities
which
the
commission
considered
to
be
exempt
and
which
the
--
to
which
the
carriers
had
gone
ahead
and
then
had
taken
his
chances
by
way
of
raising
defense
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
now,
the
determination
serves
the
purpose
of
warning,
everybody
in
the
industry
what
the
commission's
position
will
be,
both
in
its
licensing
functions
and
in
its
enforcement
policy.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
section
222
(d).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
of
course,
he
could
raise
by
way
of
defense
that
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
act
was
erroneous.
but
--
but
of
--
of
course,
by
that
route
he
has
taken,
he
has
to
take
the
risk
of
--
of
criminal
punishment.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
--
we
have
in
several
cases.
there
have
been
at
least
three
successful
criminal
prosecutions
with
respect
to
just
poultry
alone,
taking
just
one
commodity.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
companion
case,
the
complaint
case,
which
arose
in
somewhat
different
fashion.
it
arose
when
east
texas
motor
freight
lines
and
two
other
motor
carriers
complained
to
the
commission
that
frozen
food
products
was
transporting
fresh
and
frozen
--
fresh
and
frozen
meats
and
fresh
and
frozen
dressed
poultry
without
an
appropriate
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
therefore,
the
commission
held
a
hearing
and
they
should
have
report
an
order
which
it
held
that
those
commodities
were
not
exempt
commodities
and
it
directed
frozen
foods
by
order
to
cease
and
desist
from
carrying
them
without
obtaining
an
appropriate
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
rates
would
--
the
rates
would
vary
as
to
commodity
and
indeed
they
would
vary
between
commodities.
the
rates
by
and
large
are
those
filed
by
the
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
do
--
i
do
not
know
the
answer,
i'm
sorry.
there
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
determination
case?
none
of
the
parties
are
defending
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
do
not
speak
to
this
point.
i
should
say
that
the
district
court
raised
that
jurisdictional
question
sua
sponte
without
it
having
been
raised
by
any
of
the
parties.
so
thereafter,
frozen
food
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
question
that
at
all
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
thereafter
in
the
complaint
case,
frozen
food
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
brought
suit
challenging
the
commission's
conclusion.
the
commission
had
placed,
well
i
should
say,
the
district
court
sustained
the
commission's
conclusion
as
to
fresh
and
frozen
meats
and
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
aspect
of
the
decision.
the
commission
--
the
district
court
reversed
the
commission
as
to
fresh
and
frozen
dressed
poultry
and
that
is
here
--
and
that
portion
of
the
decision
is
here
on
appeal.
now,
the
commission's
decision,
its
report
in
this
complaint
case
as
to
fresh
and
frozen
dressed
poultry,
was
based
upon
--
in
part
upon
its
earlier
decision
with
respect
to
poultry
in
the
determination
case
and
in
part
upon
evidence
received
in
this
companion,
the
complaint
case.
in
its
report
in
the
determination
case,
the
commission
reviewed
the
legislative
history
of
section
203
(b).
now,
that
exception
provision
originated
in
the
house
committee
and
it's
in
its
original
format
provided
an
exemption
for
motor
vehicles
used
exclusively
in
carrying
livestock
or
unprocessed
agricultural
products.
now,
in
the
floor
of
the
house,
a
question
arose
as
to
whether
an
exemption
for
unprocessed
agricultural
commodities
would
include
such
items
as
milk
and
cream.
in
response
to
that
discussion,
the
chairman
of
the
sub-committee
in
charge
with
the
bill
offered
an
amendment
to
delete
the
words
unprocessed
agricultural
products
and
to
substitute
present
words,
agricultural
commodities
not
including
agricultural
products
thereof,
not
including
manufactured
products
thereof.
and
the
chairman,
in
introducing
that
new
language,
which
is
the
present
language
of
the
exemption,
indicated
that
it
would
cover
pasteurized
milk,
ginned
cotton
and
cotton
seed.
now,
from
this
brief,
legislative
history
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
the
commission
concluded
that
it
was
--
it
was
apparent
that
congress
intended
the
exemption
to
extend
to
commodities
of
the
natural
state
and
to
a
limited
extent
of
those
further
treated
or
processed.
that
is
the
commission
sought
to
give
full
effect
to
that
legislative
history
by
recognizing
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
every
type
of
processing
or
every
type
of
treatment
would
be
enough
to
take
an
agricultural
commodity
out
of
the
exemption.
but
it
felt
that
that
legislative
history
was
sufficiently
sparse
that
it
had
to
look
to
other
indicia
of
meaning.
so,
the
commission
turned
to
dictionary
definitions
and
particularly
to
judicial
decisions
and
they
gave
particular
way
to
a
decision
of
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
manufacturing
involves
giving
to
materials
new
forms
qualities,
properties
or
combinations.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
all
the
parties
concede
that
it's
not
enough
just
to
look
at
the
statute
here
that
the
--
the
various
meanings
--
the
possible
meanings
of
agriculture,
manufacturing,
particularly,
in
borderline
cases
are
such
that
we're
obligated
to
look
for
other
indicia
of
meaning
because
that
limited
debate
on
the
floor
is
all
we
have
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
starting
with
the
legislative
history
about
the
result.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
that's
--
that's
mentioned
separately
and
in
addition
to
agricultural
commodities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
livestock
and
agriculture
commodities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
ordinary
livestock,
an
ordinary
livestock
is
defined
in
another
portion
of
the
act
in
such
a
way
as
that
it
--
it
does
not
include
poultry,
includes
horses,
goats,
cattle
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
not
mentioned
specifically
anywhere.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
we
--
we
rely
upon
the
analogy
that
after
--
after
butchering
and
slaughtering,
the
products
of
butchering
and
slaughtering
of
livestock
or
meat
and
we
said
--
we
say
that
the
network
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
commission's
positions
which
was
sustained
by
the
court
below
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
contends
that
dressed
poultry
and
it
relies
partly
on
the
analogy
to
dressed
meat,
that
dressed
poultry
is
not
an
exempt
agricultural
commodity.
the
court
below
held
that
it
was.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
stand
corrected
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
the
very
least
it
was
in
there
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
the
very
least,
it
was
under
--
in
the
abundance
of
caution?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
ours
is
--
ours
is
dressed
poultry,
that's
what's
involved
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
it's
our
--
it's
our
contention
which
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
used
that
an
--
an
analogy
in
--
in
both
the
determination
case
in
dealing
with
poultry
and
--
and
in
its
report
in
this
complaint
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
court
below
held
that
meat,
the
product
of
slaughtering,
is
a
--
is
a
manufactured
commodity.
it
went
along
with
the
commission
with
respect
to
meat,
the
court
disagreed
with
the
commission
and
held
that
the
commission
was
in
error
in
holding
that
dressed
poultry
was
--
was
not
exempt.
and
may
i
turn
the
rest
of
the
time
over
to
mr.
macdonald.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
except
that
we
have
a
definition
of
ordinary
livestock
which
specifies
certain
types
of
animals,
the
horses
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
horses,
cattle,
swine
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
which
are
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
--
the
commission
in
both
the
determination
case
and
in
the
complaint
case
relied
upon
the
analogy.
it
drew
the
point
that
dressed
meat
was
not
an
exempt
commodity
and
that
dressed
poultry
which
is
competitive
with
the
--
in
the
butcher
shop
and
so
on
and
which
goes
to
a
somewhat
similar
processing
should
not
be
regarded
as
exempt
either.
