then
assume
the
discussion,
you
say
there
is
an
exclusion
of
what

justice

and
there
would
be
no

no,
no,

but
you

it's

at
the
conclusion

say,
what
i
should

(inaudible)
i
don't
know,
we
can
do
this

that
should
be
an

there
is
nothing

anything
on

what
we
have
here.
justice

where
is
the

where
is
the
order
on
the
page
to
which
the
hearing
was
held?
is
that
in
your

mr.
ginnane?
justice

may
i
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--just
ask
one
more
question.
turning
to
203
(b)
(6)
and
i
think
in
this
part,
it
shows
there,
it
says,
true
to
include
and
so
on
which
is
the
--
which
is
controlling
section
of
obligation
to
this
--
on
this
part
deal
with
explicit
duties
as
obligations
and
right.
justice
felix

and
--
and
the
order
on
which
--
on
the
basis
of
--
of
the
basis
of
which
is
(inaudible)
adverted
to
203
(b)
(6)
and
that
in
turns
incorporates
by
reference
the
whole
scheme
of
regulation,
is
that
right?
the
--
the
hearing
was
had
with
reference
to
the
meaning
of
these
controlling
words
of
203
(b)
(6)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
203
(b)
(6)
incorporated
by
reference
as
it
were,
the
obligations
and
rights,
the
obligations
and
duties
on
the
parts
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
all
events,
it
directs
itself
two
obligations,
it
provides
the
use
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
they
repeated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me
--
of
the
parties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
very
common
even
with
reference
to
the
same
tariffs
in
a
case
of
another
shipper
or
another
complainant
or
another
railroad
although
they're
in
a
governing
order
as
it
were,
to
receive
new
(inaudible)
that's
very
common,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
in
total
that
you
dragged
the
whole
part
ii
behind
the
--
the
court,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
told
him
because
that's
the
implication
of
the
implementations
of
part
ii.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
case
isn't
this
--
this
thing
is
your
argument,
it
might
properly
not.
this
is
very
important,
is
it,
mr.
ginnane,
because
i
hope
it's
under
your
(inaudible)
two
more
sentences
would
avoid
this
litigation.
or
another
thing,
just
one
or
two
more
words
is
telling
us
that
your
argument
is
implicit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
--
is
that
what
it's
all
about,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
few
more
care,
a
few
more
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
you.
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
suggesting
because
this
is
very
important,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
transport
effect
fixed
the
paragraph
that
--
with
no
doubt
had
become
within
--
like
this
and
all
the
pages
had
followed.
i
know
we
are
all
under
pressure
and
we
take
for
granted
the
dignity
and
you
felt
like
you
don't
have
to
sell
it
on
but
one
of
the
functions
of
lawyers
spell
out
this
on
the
table
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
taken
the
tariff
to
be
the
tariff
--
there
are
different
tariffs
to
this
class
of
goods,
for
fresh
and
for
(inaudible)
the
rates
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i
just
want
to
know
specific
whether
the
rates
are
different
considerably
in
the
case
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
doesn't
speak
to
this
point,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
a
term
for
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
shed
light
on
it,
you
say
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
so
therefore
we
have
to
do
the
rest
that
we
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
you've
already
qualified
for
me
at
least,
your
remark
that
the
commission
can
get
nothing
or
that
one
gets
nothing
out
of
the
statute,
because
the
colloquy
as
it
develops
between
you
and
mr.
justice
reed
show
that
one
does
get
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
statute,
if
he
didn't
use
the
word
agricultural
commodities
and
livestock
then
i'm
certainly
entitled
to
call
some
entry
that
livestock
was
not
included
in
agriculture
commodity
(inaudible)
inference
to
include
this
livestock
in
agricultural
commodity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
an
important
starting
point
by
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
just
want
to
ask,
as
to
the
light
of
this
--
in
view
--
in
light
of
the
case,
if
arguendo,
livestock
is
not
included
in
agricultural
commodity,
dead
chickens
are
no
more
agricultural
than
live
chicken,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you're
talking
about
poultry.
in
light
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
can't
be
more
--
can't
be
less
agricultural
than
(inaudible)
i
should
say,
i
don't
know.
that
is
not
my
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
that
what
the
issue
before
the
court,
i
hope
it
isn't
mr.
macdonald
because
you
said
it
--
well,
rather
to
me,
a
difficult,
sort
of
(inaudible)
that
economic
is
a
social
problem
that
i
hope
we
won't
have
to
decide
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
--
is
that
before
the
court
because
i'm
looking
at
these
briefs
or
in
the
record,
is
that
before
the
court,
evidence
or
other
materials
here,
which
shows
to
what
extent
there
was
a
severance
of
the
two
aspects
of
the
enterprise,
to
what
extent
of
the
raising
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
extent,
in
other
words,
the
farmers
have
the
ability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
4%
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
--
all
of
these
he
does
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
poultry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
are
the
same
and
arrested
by
independent
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
have
happened
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
all
due
respect
mr.
macdonald,
i
think
we
both
respected
life
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
this,
at
least
tell
me
what
--
based
on
(inaudible)
what
is
it,
qualifying
the
court,
until
what?
you
just
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
happening?
justice
felix
frankfurter
provided
you
reach
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
general
practice
or
my
general
remarks
on
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
that's
what
i
think.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
secretary
of
agriculture
is
a
party
--
is
a
party
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
did
not
appeal
from
the
legal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
(inaudible)
to
the
argument
that's
not
--
is
there
anything
but
you
agree
that
when
you
get
down
to
the
considerations
of
economic
pressure,
the
(inaudible)
of
the
economic
pressure
in
instance
is
the
(inaudible)
remark
or
rather
the
--
that
the
commission
was,
that
this
a
context
appealed
regulating
or
controlling
the
process
but
because
of
the
--
thereby
not
regulating
--
regulating
and
because
thereby,
an
indirect
vendor
becomes
as
a
farmer,
anything
in
that?
do
you
see
it
that
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
you
and
find
possibility
to
therefore
comes
--
is
why
the
secretary
of
agriculture
doesn't
assert
this
interest
on
behalf
of
dressed
meat
for
the
farmers
and
does
it
for
dressed
poultry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
totally
agree,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
(inaudible)
doesn't
like
to
follow
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
isn't
very
closely
affirmed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
economically
(inaudible)
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
if
that's
(inaudible)
it's
a
very
important
consideration
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
better
to
decide
that
than
to
--
i,
as
an
ignorant
city-bred,
non-agricultural
judge,
those
of
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
congress'
actually
point
is,
i
suppose
to
be
clear,
that
this
is
ambiguous
and
light
had
to
be
shed
on
it
without
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
the
primary,
initial
duty,
i
should
say,
the
primary
duty
of
construing
ambiguous
statute.
if
i'm
a
--
i'm
a
whole,
the
construction
is
not
obvious
to
all
in
resolving
the
act
of
duty,
they've
got
to
do
it
instead
of
we.
justice
felix
frankfurter
hence,
the
big
ones
but
there
are
also
small
ones
scattered
all
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weston,
you're
saying
you
are
not
arguing
here
that
the
frozen
meat
is
different
from
poultry,
you
are
not
arguing
that
but
the
fact
is
that
there's
a
judgment
here
which
makes
this
distinction.
patently,
the
court
counsel
sua
sponte
to
take
an
appeal
and
reverse
or
therefore
we
are
confronted
with
the
facts
because
of
judgment
which
says
frozen
meat
is
one,
frozen
poultry
another,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

situation
to
anybody
who
--
unless
they
do
something
rational
and
for
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
fact.
