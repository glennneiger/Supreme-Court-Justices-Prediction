may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
purloined
is
that
fact
that
we
must
take
for
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
case
they
turned
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
while
the
court
held
that
for
ohio
to
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
florida
court,
as
i
read
it
if
we
held
that
for
florida
--
for
ohio
to
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
on
the
one
side,
the
determination
and
the
next
paragraph
says,
but
the
determination,
the
ultimate
determination
is
for
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story.
the
ultimate
real
estate
is
located
in
florida.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
down
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
in
fact
that
the
florida
court
decree
anything
except
for
the
reference
of
property
the
citing
of
which
was
in
florida.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
plainly
enough
decided
the
certificates
are
within
ohio
because
ohio,
as
part
of
the
brief,
still
recognized
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
say?
well,
it
doesn't
make
a
--
it
remains
unrealistic
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
a
different
story.
it
may
well
not
be
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
she
lost
that.
she
lost
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
ohio
court
respects
it.
the
decree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
respected
the
decree
insofar
as
the
florida
court
exercised
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
it
before
us.
in
the
first
place,
ohio
didn't
set
aside
the
decree
of
divorce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
have
before
us
is
the
refusal
to
do
so,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
anyhow,
we're
--
we're
not
confronted
with
that
problem
because
there
was
no
appeal
here,
or
cross-appeal
on
--
on
certiorari,
objection
to
the
refusal
without
further
to
affirmative.
the
ohio
court
recognized
the
decree
of
divorce.
and
we're
not
confronted
with
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
that
disposition
in
ohio
but
must
be
respected.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
we
go
on
merely
to
the
question
of
justice
harlan
has
initiated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly,
what
it
is
that
the
florida
court
decreed
to
which
ohio
if
it
has
jurisdiction,
which
ohio
must
make
obedient?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference
as
to
the
finding,
equality
of
florida
on
property
not
situate
in
florida.
he
made
them
--
this
is
--
this
is
merely
ex
parte
determination,
meaning
those
who
have
noticed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
empowers
florida
to
dispose
of
the
reason
in
florida.
it
doesn't
empower
florida
to
determine
rights
and
the
reason
in
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
property
in
ohio?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
no
personal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
in
--
and
in
remedy
created
by
the
property
situate
outside
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
--
did
he
personally
appear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
personally
appear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
power
of
a
decision
as
granted
before
does
not
include,
in
the
absence
of
personal
appearance,
does
not
include
the
power
to
dispose
of
property
outside
of
the
boundary
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
cut
in
to
pennoyer
and
neff,
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
pennoyer
and
neff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
was
the
--
the
problem
of
the
considerations
that
you
have
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
disposition
of
the
property
within
the
state
lies
within
the
power
of
the
state,
whether
you
have
personal
service
or
not
or
whether
you
have
actual
notice
or
not.
as
long
as
you
don't
come
in
and
contest
it.
they're
talking
about
something
else,
namely,
the
reach
of
that
power
of
the
state
there's
property
outside
that's
before
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
thought
we
had
when
we
reversed
had
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
was
written.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
thought
we
had
(inaudible)
you
define
correctly,
quasi
in
rem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
you
can
break
within
--
you
can
break
it
summarily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
concerned
here
with
the
authority
of
ohio
of
a
property
within
its
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
would
at
least,
for
me
evidence
in
the
case.
i'm
not
saying
i've
reached
your,
at
least,
the
problem
of
your
case.
but
you
would
have
a
different
case
if
the
decree
of
ohio
and
florida
was
simply,
we've
considered
the
situation
of
the
party
as
we
have
circuit
judges
concluded
that
this
defendant
would
have
alimony,

simply
to
judge
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

as
i
read
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
didn't
conceive
here,
mr.
gorman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
couldn't
--
it
did
not
conceive
forum-shopping.
the
husband
got
a
divorce
and
ohio
properly
respected
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
ohio
might
well
have
said,
it
didn't
say
it
in
those
words,
but
for
all
practical
purposes,
it
says,
as
i
read,
as
we
read
the
decree
of
judge
morris
in
florida.
he
didn't
give
this
woman
a
divorce
because
he
said
she
does
have
property
here
in
florida
and
they
went
to
squabble
up
their
legal
controversy
up
in
ohio
about
property.
and
we're
going
to
leave
you,
whatever
property
has
this
woman
has,
the
determination
of
the
ohio
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
in
effect
judge
morris's
decree,
indicates
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
don't
go
to
the
petition.
go
to
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
it
be
--
what
was
that
date
of
this
petition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
look.
in
judge
morris's
decree
it
takes
note
of
the
fact
that
there's
litigation
pending
in
ohio
about
property,
there's
three
innocent
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
also
the
stocks
and
the
bonds.
this
court
takes
recognition
of
the
fact
that
litigation
is
now
pending
in
the
state
of
ohio
relative
toi
determine
the
stocks
and
bonds
as
well
as
settlement
for
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
morris
had
put
it
to
you,
i
put
it
to
you.
judge
morris
may
have
said,
indeed
i
think
he
did
say
in
effect
through
the
decree,
this
woman
now,
i
--
i
--
she's
been
uncomfortable
i
think
in
good
faith
but
whatever
property
she'd
be
sure
to
have
is
for
ohio
to
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
where
she
is
and
that's
why
he
is
to
make
the
personal
appearance
and
that's
where
the
property
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
partition.
i'm
talking
about
this
ground
charge
of
the
stock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
ohio
court
restricted
itself
in
the
disposition
of
that
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
physical
--
the
physical
site
is
to
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
if
it
had
been
endorsed
by
the
ohio
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
really
was
a
conversation
of
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
one
who
will
do
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gorman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
your
case
this
--
these
facts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
any
different
or
there's
no
different
legal
questions
come
into
play
and
would
be
the
case
if
this
decree,
just
as
you
have
maybe
when
mrs.
armstrong
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
goes
into
an
ohio
court
and
asks
for
alimony.
there's
no
property,
no
physical
property.
the
divorce
says
in
ohio
but
as
for
a
decree
of
alimony,
it
didn't
say
had
on
whatever
findings
that
had
to
be
found.
would
you
think
if
you
try
to
mix,
the
two
casea
are
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
any
kind
of
stock
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
what
i
mean
then
but
you
say,
they
changed
it
to
stock
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
they
changed
to
this
particular
stock
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
we
haven't
got
that
case
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
not
that
mere
cash
case
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
ask
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
the
decree
is
if
he
can
give
this
woman
x
dollars
each
month?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
in
cases
in
ohio,
situations
like
this
in
which
the
decree
in
a
physical
state,
the
denial
of
divorce
or
refusal
to
give
divorce
in
the
decree
in
--
in
the
outside
state
and
then
a
proceeding
by
an
ohio
wife
against
a
husband
for
alimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
had
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sibbald,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
suppose
it
allowed
the
state,
the
issue
was
an
issue
of
full
faith
and
credit
was
intended,
that's
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
you
even
have
reconciled
that
provision
with
the
stocks
of
your
ohio
--
the
ohio
decree
which
you
here
supporting
on
page
17
of
the
record
recognized
the
florida
decree
because
the
court
was
under
compulsion
is
completely
credible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
now
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
evidently
--
evidently,
the
--
the
compulsion
--
the
compulsion,
the
amenability
the
duty
of
obedience
of
ohio
to
hold
the
florida
decree
was
considered
in
respect
to
in
part
by
the
ohio
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
they
declare
as
the
decree
is
the
pre-hearing,
invoke,
respect
for
the
divorce
or
to
the
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
simply,
but
you
were
no
concerned
with
that
(inaudible)
but
that
would
answer
the
reference
in
the
record
support
namely,
that
they
merely
said
--
justice

--
to
take
the
support.
justice

what
is
involved
in
that
--
justice

what
is
involved
in
that
case
still
pending?
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
this
very
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
is
there
an
issue?
justice

is
the
interest
in
that
property
wholly
from
the

if
he
should

the

is.
justice

secondly,
what
the
power
of
the

isn't
addressing
the

as

property
which
is
