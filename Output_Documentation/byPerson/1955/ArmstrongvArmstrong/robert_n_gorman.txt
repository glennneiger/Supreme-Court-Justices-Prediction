mr.
robert
n.
gorman
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
certiorari
--
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
it
involves
questions
of
full
faith
and
credit
and
due
process
of
law
in
reference
to
a
divorce
actions
in
both
florida
and
ohio.
briefly,
the
question
is
this.
armstrong,
the
petitioner
was
granted
a
divorce
in
florida
where
both
he
and
his
wife
had
lived
for
22
years,
where
they
had
a
matrimonial
domicile.
she
had
fled
to
ohio.
the
florida
court
denied
her
alimony.
subsequently,
after
this
decree
was
entered,
she
filed
a
suit
in
ohio
for
divorce
and
alimony.
the
ohio
court
gave
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
divorce,
but
awarded
her
alimony
of
1250
shares
of
general
motors
stock
approximately
worth,
today,
$170,000.
now,
it
is
our
contention,
in
this
case,
that
where
the
matrimonial
domicile,
and
the
doctrine
has
not
been
entirely
abandoned,
even
though
it
has
been
whittled
away
and
where
she
was
served
under
a
statute
in
florida,
reasonably
calculated
to
give
her
notice.
and
that
she
actually
did
receive
notice,
and
deliberately
refused
to
appear
in
florida.
we
say
that
the
ohio
court
should
have
given
entire
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
entire
decree,
and
not
applied
the
doctrine
of
divisible
divorce.
these
facts
supported
and
anything
we
had
in
(inaudible)
or
in
other
case,
because
in
those
cases
and
all,
the
husband
would
go
to
another
state
and
there
obtained
a
divorce.
then
the
wife
would
either
--
they
held
the
support
order
which
survived
or
she'd
come
back
later.
these
facts
are
different.
here,
the
husband
remains
in
the
matrimonial
domicile
and
the
wife
flees
to
another
state.
if
such
a
doctrine
is
to
be
upheld,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
forum-shopping
is
a
premium.
that
the
husband
could
go.
take
for
example
here
and
we
had
an
actual
case
on
this
(inaudible)
he
goes
to
ohio
and
takes
all
his
securities
with
him.
the
wife
cannot
get
any
alimony
because
she
can't
get
personal
service.
we
maintain
that
if
that's
the
matrimonial
domicile,
the
wife
ought
to
their
sufficient
dominant
interest
in
the
matrimonial
domicile
and
when
where
service
is
given
that
that
ought
to
be
recognized.
now,
this
matter's
never
been
before
the
court.
you
can
go
back
to
way
226
united
states,
in
the
thompson
case,
and
justice
pitney
in
that
case,
which
has
never
been
overruled.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
distinguished
in
the
estin
case
and
if
i
would
assume
it's
still
the
law,
that
it's
going
to
be
distinguished.
but
we're
not
like
right
--
relying
alone
on
the
thompson
case.
there
may
be
some
modification
in
that
rule.
now,
i
think
briefly
with
that,
as
to
the
question,
i
should
give
you
the
facts.
armstrong,
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
were
married
in
cincinnati
ohio
on
june
18th,
1917.
shortly
after
that,
they
went
to
florida
and
except
for
a
short
period
of
time
spent
in
the
isle
of
pines,
they
lived
in
miami,
florida.
there's
no
question
about
that.
you
can
read
both
her
testimony
on
page
62,
and
his
testimony
on
page
119.
they
quoted
there,
they
owned
their
home
there,
they
paid
their
taxes
there
and
they
claimed
there
exemptions.
now,
they
had
some
squabbles
in
the
latter
part
of
1940's.
and
they
were
adjusted.
they
owned
real
estate
there
and
the
principal
stock
although,
there
was
others
which
armstrong
had
at
that
time
2250
shares
of
general
motors
stock
in
his
own
name,
on
which
he
paid
taxes
in
florida.
in
october
of
1950,
mrs.
armstrong
purloined
those
unendorsed
certificates
and
went
to
ohio
with
him.
the
record
shows
that
she
did
not
immediately
intend
to
make
that
her
domicile.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
certainly.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
she
took
them
with
him.
they
were
unendorsed.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
as
a
matter
fact,
the
florida
court
held
they
would
go
on.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh
yes,
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
they
held
that
--
yes,
in
one
respect.
but
they
made
also
the
statement
in
the
record
as
i
have
it
here,
page
248.
in
florida,
a
wife
may
be
guilty
of
conversion
or
even
embezzlement
of
her
husband's
property.
that's
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
that's
the
only
state
in
nation
that
quotes
that.
that's
at
248.
the
court,
therefore,
finds
that
the
stock
certificates,
bonds
registry
in
the
name
of
the
plaintiff,
the
possession
of
which
had
been
taken
by
the
defendant
against
the
consent
of
the
plaintiff
are
the
property
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
they
did
say
that.
it
was
the
ultimate
determination.
but
they
were
also
speaking
the
ultimate
determination
was
real
estate
up
there
which
is
presenting
partitions.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no.
there's
some
real
estate
located
in
ohio,
which
is
the
subject
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
what
is
that?
which
is
a
subject
of
a
partition
suit
and
was
assumed.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that
is
correct.
now,
where
we
cite
these
are
certificates
is
my
point.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
it
part
of
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes,
i
understand
that.
i
don't
think
in
our
contention
it
makes
any
difference
where
they
were.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
don't
think
so,
because
we'd
--
we'd
come
up
to
the
ohio
court,
in
the
proposition,
the
action
that
she
filed
is
to
set
aside
before
the
divorce
decree
in
its
entirely.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
she
lost
that
part.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
they
respected
that
in
apparent
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
everyone
seems
to
feel
that
way
except
mr.
sibbald,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent.
he
seems
to
feel
there's
some
question
open
on
that.
but
no
one
else
does
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
--
divorce
decree.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
they
did
not
set
it
aside.
all
they
did,
they
did
not
recognize
that
portion
of
the
decree
which
denied
alimony.
that's
all
ohio
did.
they
recognized
the
divorce.
and,
of
course
they
should
after
all.
if
there
was
ever
a
domicile
of
course
in
florida.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
of
course,
i
think
the
statement
is
there.
it
is
here
on
page
249.
it
said,
"the
court
therefore
finds
that
the
defendant
is
not
coming
to
this
court
with
faith
or
made
any
claims
to
that
of
conscience
to
the
court.
and
has
made
no
showing
of
any
need
on
her
part
for
alimony.
it
is,
therefore,
specifically
decreed,
that
no
award
of
alimony
be
made
to
the
defendant."
and
then
they
go
on
and
say,
"and
that
the
legal
and
equitable
title
to
the
real
estate
above
described,
was
vested
in
the
plaintiff
and
so
forth."
now,
i
don't
read
that
brief
simply
to
mention
to
say,
"we're
not
allowing
any
alimony
out
of
the
real
estate"
because
there's
that
word
in
there,
"and
they
say,
that
no
award
of
alimony
has
been
made
to
it."
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no.
i
do
no
think
so.
because
what
the
court
did
there
was
pending
there,
a
partition
suit
at
that
time
which
involved
property.
and
the
florida
court
recognized
that.
and
i
think
it
was
in
reference
to
that
that
they
were
saying
that
ohio
would
have
the
right
to
determine
it,
not
on
the
question
of
alimony.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
two
points.
they
both
own
real
estate,
real
estate
jointly
in
ohio
and
indiana.
now,
certainly,
that
would
be
subject
to
partition
in
indiana.
but
in
addition
to
that,
mrs.
armstrong
was
not
only
claiming
as
alimony,
but
she
was
claiming
in
some
way
that
she
was
a
joint
owner
of
that
property
in
ohio.
that
having
been
purchased
with
her
funds,
that
part
of
it
was
hers.
and
that's
the
reason
why
that
part
of
the
decree
is
in
there.
that
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
alimony
action
at
all,
or
divorce
action.
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
separate
action
where
she
was
making
a
claim
that
it
was
her
property,
which
is
pending
in
the
other
suit.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
the
--
you
will
notice
the
entire
part
of
the
record
is
here.
and
the
decree
is
there
on
page
249.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
what
did
you
say?
199
is
the
bill
of
the
complaint,
which
you
will
see.
the
bill
of
complaint
to
divorce
is
exhibit
3.
it
follows
the
entire
proceedings,
of
course,
from
199
is
a
florida
proceeding.
so,
we
have
both
the
proceedings
in
ohio
court
and
florida
court
before
us.
and
in
there,
the
prayer
--
then
there's
an
amendment
on
213,
as
you'll
notice.
that's
in
reference
to
a
redress,
but
it's
a
rather
long
complaint
if
you'll
notice,
on
page
199.
that
is
my
opinion.
and
i
think
if
you
consult
the
record
that
that
question
of
the
parting
of
florida
decree,
was
in
reference
to
the
independent
action
that
was
then
pending
at
the
time
the
decree
was
put
on.
there
was
an
action
pending
as
is
shown
by
the
record.
for
example,
i
think
the
most
significant
point
in
the
whole
case,
insofar
as
we're
concerned,
are
the
two
letters
on
exhibit
2,
exhibit
(i)
and
(j)
on
page
302
and
303.
you
will
notice
in
page
303
that
after
service,
mr.
sibbald
wrote
to
the
attorney
for
armstrong,
"some
days
ago,
i
filed
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
an
action
to
partition
the
ohio
real
estate
in
the
cause
to
summon
to
the
issue
which
has
been
returned
not
found."
then
he
says,
in
the
next
paragraph
and
this
is
the
most
significant
thing."
i
do
not
intend
to
enter
mrs.
armstrong's
appearance
in
a
complaint
for
divorce.
i
presume
that
complaint
will
result
in
a
decree
and
that
you
will
prosecute
that
matter
to
an
early
conclusion.
that
being
so,
that
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
such
that
i
shall
be
compelled
in
proceedings
to
be
filed
here,
to
claim
the
decree
was
procured
upon
false
allegations."
so,
i
mean
it
shows
in
the
record
definitely,
not
only
that
there
was
actual
or
notice
by
publication
what
she
received,
actual
notice.
and
she
deliberately
refused
to
return
to
florida.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
that
is
the
question.
let
us
say,
that
certainly
if
you
had
divorce,
let
us
say
in
ohio.
and
the
real
estate
is
located
in
new
york
or
the
property
in
new
york.
ohio
could
wind
up
the
entire
property
sale.
make
it
right
there
in
the
divorce
decree.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yet,
no
property
all
over
it.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
but
there
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
be
any
question,
for
instance,
that
if
there
would
be
an
action
between
my
wife
and
self
--
myself,
which,
of
course,
there
never
would
be.
but
if
there
would
be
such
an
action
in
ohio
and
i
own
property
in
california,
the
ohio
court
would
determine
in
the
divorce
decree,
whose
property
that
was
in
california,
because
it'd
jurisdiction
over
both
of
us.
the
personal
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
now
you're
talking
about
the
in
rem.
i'm
talking
about
an
in
personam
decree.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well
now,
this
--
that
comes
to
the
real
question
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
now,
of
course,
then
you'll
come
down
to
the
whole
question
that's
in
here.
i
will
concede
this.
if
you
make
the
strict
--
strict
application
of
pennoyer
versus
neff,
then
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
right.
if
you
take
the
actions
to
one
--
if
you're
going
to
hold
to
the
actions
that
are
in
personam
and
those
who
that
are
in
rem,
then
we're
out.
that
i
concede.
there's
no
question
about
that.
if
you're
going
to
take
it
strictly.
but
if
you
can
take
to
this
action
that
we
have
that
are
equivalent
to
the
cases,
first
of
all,
you
have
before
in
a
statute
on
constructive
service,
which
unfortunately
is
not
in
our
brief
but
i
can
give
you
the
section,
4813.
it
is
a
statute
that
provides
that
the
notice
must
be
mailed
to
the
defendant.
we
say
it
is
reasonably
calculated
to
give
notice.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
think
so.
because
if
we
come
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
--
if
we
come
to
the
matter
of
milliken
and
meyer,
then
we'd
get
to
this
theory
of
the
matter.
were
the
interest
of
florida,
where
there
domicile
was
for
22
years,
were
they
sufficiently
dominant,
that
they
could
settle
all
the
marital
relations
between
ship
or
relations
between
the
parties?
that's
the
whole
matter.
are
they
sufficiently
dominant?
we
say
they
are.
we
say
they
lived
there
for
22
years.
we
take
for
example
hess
v.
pawloski.
certainly,
if
by
running
an
automobile
over
a
highway
of
a
state,
you
can
get
personal
judgment
against
the
person.
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
interest
of
a
state
where
they
lived
for
22
years
are
sufficiently
dominant,
to
be
able
to
settle
all
there
affairs.
that
is
our
position
in
the
matter.
and,
if
you
have
further
the
proposition,
which
is,
that
if
there
is
a
statute
that
is
reasonably
calculated
to
give
such
notice
and
there
is
actual
notice,
then
we
say
due
process
is
complied.
now,
if
due
process
is
complied
with,
then
you
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida
decree.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
that's
the
question
of
whether
we
had
a
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction.
i
quite
agree.
but
if
it's
founded
not
only
on
quasi
in
rem,
then
only
the
property
that's
in
florida
can
be
subject,
then
outlawed,
you
might
say
by
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
know
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
and.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
but
--
but
you
were
doing
when
you
come
to,
not
only
the
question
of
property
in
ohio
over
its
domain,
you
have
to
consider
the
first
point.
florida
has
rendered
the
decree.
in
the
florida
decree,
there
are
two
matters.
one,
a
divorce
is
granted.
two,
alimony
is
denied.
now,
i
say
i
read
that
decree
that
it's
denied
completely,
alimony.
can
ohio,
can
there
be
a
collateral
attack,
made
upon
that
florida
decree
or
do
they
have
to
go
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida's
brief?
now,
the
second
matter
comes
in,
which
i
never
thought
which
as
strong
as
to
have
question
of
property
in
florida
giving
them
jurisdiction.
that
never
has
appealed
to
me
as
much
as
the
fact,
that
i
think
florida
had
such
--
they
certainly
had
minimal
contacts
and
it
certainly
complies
with
out
notions,
the
traditional
notions
of
fair
play.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
think
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
that's
what
i
think
it
says.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
what
i
think
it
says.
i
think
the
rest
of
it
because
here's
the
question.
after
all,
when
a
wife
gets
alimony,
she
hasn't
getting
an
interest
in
the
writs.
what
she
is
getting
are
rights
of
support.
it's
not
in
specific
property
at
all.
it's
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
--
to
enter
right.
now,
i
say
the
great
difficulty
of
the
matter.
that
when
you
--
i
have
no
complaint
with
estin.
i
said
that
before,
i
have
no
complaint
with
applying
the
doctrine
of
divisible
divorce
to
a
case
of
estin,
where
say,
the
husband
goes
out
to
nevada.
and
there's
no
personal
service.
i
think
that
her
right
to
alimony
should
survive
in
such
states
where
they
permit
it
to
survive.
there
are
some
states
like
vermont
where
they
don't.
and
they
say
a
wife
is
only
a
person
who
can
get
alimony
matter.
but
i
don't
--
i'm
going
to
be
frank
in
saying
ohio
is
not
one
of
those
states.
i
think
florida
was.
i
don't
know
where
florida
is
now,
since
the
pawley
case
is
a
cuban
case.
but
they
were
originally
under
the
(inaudible)
case
they
were
just
exactly
like
vermont.
that
once
there
was
a
divorce,
they
couldn't
--
no
matter
where
it
was,
you
couldn't
have
alimony.
now,
my
point
is
this.
that
if
we
uphold
the
ohio
decree
what
we
do
is
to
have
nothing
but
a
chaotic
situation.
there
is
no
form
in
the
world
then,
where
a
husband
and
wife
can
have
their
marital
difficulties
settled,
because
the
fleeing
spouse
can
say,
"i
don't
like
florida.
i
think
i
can
get
better
the
alimony
of
indiana
and
go
up
there."
unless
she
can
get
personal
service
on
her
husband,
she'll
never
get
any
alimony.
and
the
husband,
if
he
stays
in
the
domicile
and
the
wife
goes
some
place,
he
can't
get
his
marital
difficulties
settled.
there's
no
form
in
the
world.
and
what
it
does,
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
it
puts
a
premium
on
--
on
forum-shopping,
in
a
stay
of
migratory
divorce.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well
now
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
let's
see
if
it
does,
sir.
let
us
turn
to
the
very
first
petition.
the
petition
in
this
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no.
i
want
to
go
to
the
petition
in
ohio.
they
didn't
ask
for
that.
just
take
it
that
they
asked
in
the
petition
in
ohio,
that
the
florida
decree
be
set
aside
on
the
ground
of
fraud
and
you'll
fight
the
prayer.
they're
not
asking
for
any
division
of
property.
wherefore
plaintiff
prays
that
she
be
divorced
from
the
defendant
at
the
top
of
page
6.
that
she
be
awarded
alimony
temporary
and
permanent
and
their
expenses.
that
the
defendant
corporations
be
required
to
cancel
and
reissue
the
certificates
of
stock.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that
petition
was
filed
on
december
the
19th,
1952.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
partition
action,
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
but
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
but
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
but
that
petition
that
he
refers
to
was
not
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
not
before
this
court.
but
this
time,
the
action
partition.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
there's
certainly
nothing
in
there.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
that's
where
we
--
you
and
i
part
company.
i
don't
read
the
decree
there.
i
read
the
decree
as
if
they
denied
her
alimony,
not
on
a
question
of
property
at
all.
and
once
it's
denied,
the
question
is
whether
it's
res
judicata
and
you
go
full
faith
and
credit
to
it
or
can
she
file
an
action
in
ohio
and
practically
appeal
it
in
a
separate
state?
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
now,
that's
the
question
that
i
see
here.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
think
the
site
was
--
was
in
florida.
that's
my
own
opinion.
he
owned
it.
that's
where
he
paid
taxes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
what
is
that?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
the
physical
site
as
was
with
her
with
unendorsed
certificates.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
in
ohio.
the
physical
site
as
to
the
certificates
was
in
ohio.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
you
could
only
attack
it
if
later
there
were
changed
circumstances.
you
could
attack
it
then.
she
could
go
down
in
florida
and
attack
it
and
that's,
we
claim
where
she
should
have.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
only
under
changed
circumstances
that,
i
know,
to
understand
it
all.
if
there
were
changed
circumstances
here,
then
an
alimony
decree
might
become
ambulatory,
unless
it's
made
it
subject
to
agreement.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
carried
none
at
all?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
i
don't
it
could
--
in
that
circumstances
that
the
court
never
pass
on
it.
question
was
sort
to
support
rights
which
she'll
be
open.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
why,
i
think
there's
no
question
about
the
fact.
as
i
say
where
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
disagree
is
on
the
interpretation
of
that
decree.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
i
say
it,
it
denies
alimony.
and
i
say
that
denial
of
alimony
is
not
a
question
of
whether
there's
an
interest
in
property
or
not.
now,
that's
cutting
off
her
rights.
on
other
hand,
where
you
have
community
property
estates
they
have
an
interest
in
property.
we
have
neither
of
those
in
florida
or
in
ohio.
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
identical.
no
question
about
it
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
let's
go
off
the
record,
if
we
can.
in
this
particular
decree
i
came
in
as
of
late.
i
came
in
at
the
time
when
the
motion
couldn't
try
and
when
we
argued
thompson
case
at
great
length,
which
i
haven't
touched
upon
yet.
originally,
judge
bell
wanted
to
award
$75,000
in
cash.
that
was
his
judgment.
and
they
changed
it
to
stock.
so,
it's
the
same
as
if
it
was
a
money
judgment.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
not
any
kind
of
stock
just
money.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
instead
of
money.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
they
did.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
--
that's
right.
they
changed
it
to
a
particular
stock.
but
originally,
he
decreed
and
you
will
notice
in
judge
bell's
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
what
is
that?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
think
it's
a
same.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
it's
identical.
because
if
we
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
--
voted
judge
bell's
decree,
we
will
find
in
that
decree,
what
he
says
in
there,
he
calls
it
alimony.
it's
not
anything
as
division
of
property.
so,
the
facts
are
identical.
as
your
case
is
if
it
makes
no
difference.
i
don't
think
mr.
sibbald
will
argue
that
if
whether
he
give
it
in
cash
or
whether
he
give
it
in
stock.
we
have
the
same
facts,
same
identities.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
would
have
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
absolutely,
no
question
about
it.
a
question,
i
don't
think
of
the
stock,
the
decree
being
in
shares
of
stock
has
the
slightest
thing
to
do
with
it.
certainly
not,
i
don't
think
under
the
ohio
law,
as
you
had
the
option
to
give
it
in
cash
or
an
option
to
give
it
in
stock.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
parties
agreed
on
the
stock.
that's
the
way
it
was
given.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
i
think
they
have.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
there
had
been
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
now,
i
think
there
probably
have
been.
i
couldn't
cite
them
off
hand.
the
slapp
case
in
ohio,
142
ohio
state
is
identical
with
estin.
the
husband
goes
out
to
nevada,
that
kind
of
a
case.
there's
an
older
case,
the
cox
case
where
they
migrate
between
indiana
and
ohio.
i
don't
know
of
any
particular
where
the
husband
was
denied
the
divorce
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
and
it
came
back.
i
think
usually
the
case
is
where
the
husband
is
given
a
divorce
and
then
they
come
back.
but
there
again
you're
going
into
the
question
of
migration
of
leaving
the
matrimonial
domicile.
now,
i'm
willing
to
concede
one
other
point.
in
thompson
versus
thompson,
there
you
have
the
case
where
alimony
was
denied
in
virginia
and
the
wife
then
went
into
--
that's
226
united
states.
the
wife
then
went
into
district
of
columbia.
the
district
court
awarded
her
alimony.
this
court
said
no.
i
suppose
they
could
have
put
the
decision
on
the
district
of
columbia's
ruling
at
that
time.
that
alimony
did
not
survive
a
divorce,
just
like
in
cases
in
vermont,
and
recently
being
(inaudible)
but
justice
pitney
did
not
do
it
on
that
ground.
he
did
it
on
the
basis
of
full
faith
and
credit.
of
course,
if
that
was
as
still
--
still
the
law,
this
case
would
have
to
be
reversed.
now,
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
since
we
have
estin
versus
estin,
that
thompson
versus
thompson
there
might
be
some
modification.
but
i
take
it
will
present
a
chaotic
situation,
if
you'd
overrule
thompson
versus
thompson
entirely.
and
that's
what
you'd
have
to
do
here
in
order
to
maintain
this
decree.
now,
as
late
as
the
estin
case
you
distinguished
thompson
versus
thompson.
but
i
think
on
there
on
the
grounds
of
fault.
and
i
see
no
reason
to
come
on
fault.
my
thing
is
this,
that
if
being
the
matrimonial
domicile,
that
florida
had
the
dominant
interest,
that
she
was
given
reasonable
notice,
she
had
actual
notice
and
that
satisfied
the
requirements
of
due
process.
and
once
it
satisfied
the
requirements
of
due
process,
then
full
faith
and
credit
have
to
be
given
to
it.
and
i
think
we've
come
down
to
the
final
question,
is
whether
were
going
to
extend
milliken
and
meyer
and
head
first,
will
pull
us,
where
a
man
just
drives
over
the
highway.
if
that
gives
a
right
for
personal
judgment,
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
people
lived
there
for
22
years,
that
that
state
ought
to
have
as
much
right
as
a
state
where
the
automobile
is
driven.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
i
object
to
it
for
two
reasons.
its
not
part
of
the
record,
the
certified
record
has
never
been
before
the
court
before
and
secondly,
it's
filed
under
it
and
it's
only
a
supplement
in
this
brief
i've
just
read.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
how
long
would
i
have
to
answer?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
so,
it
wouldn't
take
more
than
two
or
three
days.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
thank
you.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
there
have
been
many
questions
it
seems
to
me
that
--
or
aside
from
the
issues.
now,
i
want
to
say
right
at
the
outset
and
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
my
former
colleague,
judge
zimmerman,
who
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
ohio.
but
very
frankly,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
a
much
more
exhaustive
opinion
and
it
shows
that
practically
every
one
of
these
questions
that
was
here
were
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals.
they
were
not
any
last
minutes
suggestions
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
on
11
(a)
to
24
(a)
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
for
example,
on
17
(a),
it
shows
that
mr.
sibbald
did
raise
the
question
that
the
divorce
was
fraudulent
and
the
court
of
appeals
there
found
there
was
no
fraud
and
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
that
stuff
about
master
commissioner's
fees.
and
the
court
of
appeals
says,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
trial
court
made
no
express
finding
that
the
florida
decree
had
been
obtained
through
fraud
and
deceit.
and
then
there
is
another
proposition
in
the
opinion
on
14
(a),
it
went
into
length
about
hitting
people
and
knocking
their
teeth
out,
all
of
those
matters
were
disputed,
that
letter
was
very
greatly
disputed
because
most
of
it
was
in
her
own
handwriting
and
armstrong
said
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
signing.
he
knew
what
he
wrote
out
but
what
she
wrote
out,
he
didn't
know.
but
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
14
(a)
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
there
it
says
in
the
last
paragraph,
at
the
trial
of
these
issues
evidence
was
introduced
from
which
the
conclusion
could
be
reasonably
deduced
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
action,
that's
mrs.armstrong,
had
been
guilty
of
gross
neglect
of
duty
and
extreme
cruelty
and
that
the
florida
decree
granting
a
divorce
to
defendant
herein
was
supported
by
sufficient
evidence.
well,
if
that
is
true
what
our
claim
is
and
if
those
were
the
facts,
ohio
could
not
act
as
a
court
of
review
on
that
florida
decree
because
if
those
facts
are
true,
they
have
once
adjudicated
and
they
had
said,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
they
had
denied
alimony,
which
is
on
page
249
of
the
record.
now,
i
want
to
say
before
coming
to
one
of
the
most
important
points
that
this
issue
has
been
in
the
case
from
the
very
outset.
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
page
2
and
3
of
mr.
sibbald's
brief,
where
he
brings
up
the
question
that
the
florida
decree
was
obtained
by
fraud,
then
you
go
to
page
7
of
the
record
whereas
defendant
denies
that
plaintiff
was
not
served
with
summons
and
set
action
pending
in
the
dade
county
circuit
court.
it
said
defendant
have
been
duly
and
legally
served
with
summons
and
set
action.
according
to
the
law
of
state
of
florida
and
that
by
reason
thereof
said
court
had
full
and
complete
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
this
action
and
over
the
persons
of
this
defendant.
i
don't
know
how
more
clearly
you
can
raise
an
issue
of
res
judicata
than
that.
but
if
there
was
any
doubt
if
you
will
turn
to
page
11,
which
mr.
sibbald
did
not
read,
for
further
answer,
defendant
denies
each
and
every
allegation
in
plaintiff's
amended
petition
contained,
not
herein
specifically
admitted
to
be
true.
and
further
says
that
by
reason,
the
allegations
aforesaid,
plaintiffs
is
--
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
a
divorce
or
alimony
from
defendant.
within
there
very
clearly,
so
the
issue
has
been
here
all
the
time,
both
the
supreme
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
it.
and
i
might
say,
by
the
way,
that
there
is
no
question
raised
either
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
that
this
was
a
division
of
property.
there
are
two
things
that
are
clear
in
both
opinions.
one
is
that
the
matrimonial
domicile,
they
say,
was
in
fraud
and
there's
no
evidence
to
the
conflict.
and
secondly,
they
recognized
the
florida
decree
as
one,
not
going
into
a
division
to
property
but
denying
alimony.
if
you
will
turn
to
25
(a),
here
is
what
the
supreme
court
says
in
the
syllabus
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
in
the
petition
for
writ.
and
i
think
we've
had
an
argument
before
here
over
what
the
syllabus
in
ohio
means
in
a
former
case.
paragraph
2
of
the
syllabus,
25
(a),
such
a
divorce
decrees
in
favor
husband
based
on
service
by
publication
on
the
wife
residing
in
another
state
does
not
as
to
a
denial
of
alimony
therein
operate
extraterritorially
and
he's
not
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
section
in
the
opinion.
if
we
go
over
to
page
28,
but
may
a
divorce
secured
by
a
husband
even
in
the
so-called
matrimonial
domicile
were
service
of
summons
on
the
wife
then
residing
another
state
has
been
by
publication
only
denied
a
wife
any
right
to
alimony
not
division
of
property,
so
that
such
denial
must
be
recognized
this
conclusive
in
another
jurisdiction.
they
say
we
think
not.
but
on
those
two
points,
matrimonial
domicile
and
on
the
question
of
this
being
whether
it's
alimony
or
whether
it's
a
division
of
property,
there
was
no
dispute
whatsoever
in
the
lower
courts
and
if
we
take
the
decree
on
page
248
of
the
record
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir
--
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
right.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
the
prayer
to
complaint?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that
it'd
be
divorce
and
should
be
awarded
alimony
temporary
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that
the
defendant,
raymond
c.armstrong,
said
the
corporation
would
be
required
to
cancel
and
reissue
the
certificates
of
stock
heretofore
described
in
such
division
thereof.
there's
no
question
of
grateful.
the
court
did
not
grant
it.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
the
court
did
not
grant
it.
the
court
designates
it
in
its
order,
which
is
on
page
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
--
17.
now,
wait
a
minute,
not
17.
they
award
this
as
alimony.
that's
on
page
18.
and
the
plaintiff,
mary
armstrong,
is
entitled
to
alimony
as
prayed
for
in
amended
opinion.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
ohio
order,
who
order
that
it's
alimony
not
a
division
of
property
though.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no,
this
is
all
in
ohio.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
this
is
ohio,
all
the
way.
it
was
just
in
required
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
yes,
sir,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no
question.
we're
not
like
vermont.
i
have
to
conceive
that
as
an
alimony
award.
it
would
survive
a
--
a
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes,
slapp
versus
slapp.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
142,
ohio
state.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
i
can
go
behind
that.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
yes
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
--
that's
true
--
that's
true,
but
i
say
it
does.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
and
i
think
that
the
ohio
court
so
recognized
that
it
did
because
they
so
say
in
all
their
opinion.
in
other
words,
this
question
of
division
of
property,
i
think,
i've
argued
this
matter
four
times
now
and
this
the
first
time
its
ever
been
raised
as
a
property
matter
that
comes
up.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
there
are
still
pending.
those
armstrong's
cases,
there's
been
no
order
on
there
on
the
stock
at
all
and
that's
still
pending.
and,
of
course,
that
is
the
reference,
which
is
made
to
on
page
248.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
to
have
her
coming
in
and
deliver
the
certificates
over
to
him.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
this
very
property
and
that's
still
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
there
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
i
would
say
it
would
be.
but
according
to
the
petition,
my
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
it's
an
independent
action.
there
is
no
question
about
it
and
that's
what
248
means.
on
page
248,
the
court
takes
recognition
of
the
fact
that
litigation
is
now
pending
in
the
state
of
ohio,
remedy
of
recovering
the
stocks
and
bonds.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
sir?
yes.
i
--
there
is
an
injunction
suit
and
she
filed
a
partition
suit,
which
dealt
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
now,
that
has
been
settled,
the
partition
suit,
the
real
estate
has
all
been
sold.
that's
been
settled.
and
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
she
returned
actually
the
physical
certificates
over
and
that's
where,
of
course,
you'd
the
suit
there
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
there
are
others
--
her
suit
involved
a
partition
of
real
estate
and
that
has
all
been
determined.
that
was
referred
to
a
master
commissioner
and
that's
been
decided
and
the
money
has
all
been
divided
up.
but
i
think
there's
no
question
to
see
about
the
decree
because
it's
dated
october
1st,
1951.
and
this
petition
is
not
filed
until
1952
and
they
are
referring
there
to
armstrong
separate
action
to
recover
the
physical
certificates.
and
that's
what
he
had
to
do
in
a
separate
action
because
there
was
no
way
he
could
get
them
down
in
another
state.
now,
i
think
we
always
comeback
as
i
say,
you
can
talk
about
pawley
versus
pawley.
pawley
versus
pawley
as
if
--
my
opinion,
a
very
poorly
written
opinion,
but
it
does
not
have
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
at
all.
it's
one
on
comity.
it's
a
matter
of
a
divorce
in
cuba.
and
the
real
question,
if
you
read
all
the
opinions
was
not
a
matter
of
full
faith
and
credit.
it
was
rather
pawley
an
american
citizen,
could
go
over
to
cuba
and
get
a
divorce.
that
was
really
what
was
at
stake
there.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
a
valid
cuban
divorce,
yes.
and
they
held
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes,
that's
true.
and
it
does
on
contract
to
the
earlier
decision
of
stewart
versus
stewart,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
where
stewart
versus
stewart
takes
the
position
that
for
--
and
it's
not
mentioned,
by
the
way,
in
the
pawley
case.
stewart
versus
stewart
takes
the
position
that
an
alimony
will
not
survive
by
a
divorce
in
florida.
so,
we
don't
get
much
help
out
of
florida
as
i
see
it.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
not
at
all
for
this
reason,
that
in
the
pawley
case,
there
over
in
cuba.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
in
florida.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
did
they
live
there?
was
that
the
matrimonial
domicile?
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
oh,
nevada,
that
makes
all
a
difference
in
the
world.
i
have
never
made
a
claim
if
armstrong
went
out
to
nevada
and
got
this
decree
in
this
way
in
service
by
publication.
there
would
be
a
good
decree.
my
claim
is
this,
that
florida
was
the
state
--
the
state
of
the
dominant
interest
that
if
they
couldn't
settle
their
problems
in
florida,
they
couldn't
settle
them
anywhere.
now,
i
might
say
to
you
and
i
dislike
even
reading
one
sentence
from
a
--
an
annotator
who
has
gone
over
these
decisions
but
i'm
going
to
read
it
because
i
don't
agree
with
it
entirely.
it's
in
20
a.l.r.2d
1393,
he
said
it
has
been
suggested
that
a
valid
ex
parte
decree
rendered
by
a
court
at
the
matrimonial
domicile,
which
under
the
law,
that
place
has
the
effect
of
terminating
some
wife's
right
to
alimony.
he
should
be
entitled
to
recognition
in
that
respect
even
though
a
valid
ex
parte
decree
of
any
other
state
would
not
be
so
entitled.
that
would
be
a
direct
answer
to
your
question
but
i
don't
think
that
suggestion
goes
far
enough.
that
is
really
thompson
versus
thompson.
i
say
in
addition
to
that
to
give
it
full
faith
and
credit
you
must
have
two
things.
there
must
be
a
statute
whereby
you
can
get
service
by
publication,
which
is
reasonably
calculated
to
give
notice
to
the
pleading
spouse.
and
secondly,
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
reinforce.
it
went
under
that
statute
as
shown
by
the
record
on
pages
302
and
303
that
the
pleading
spouse
did
actually
get
notice
and
she
refused
to
appear
because
otherwise,
if
we
do
not
hold
that,
i
think,
it
goes
to
the
extreme
in
forum
shop,
a
man
and
a
wife
were
married,
went
up
and
thinks
the
forum
isn't
as
favorable.
we
can
get
larger
alimony
over
in
indiana.
let's
go
there.
and
she
goes
over
to
--
to
indiana.
she
can't
ever
get
any
alimony
unless
he
comes
in
there
personally
or
let's
say
the
spouse
goes
to
another
jurisdiction
and
she's
powerless
to
get
anything
and
suppose
he'd
taken
all
the
general
motor
stock
with
him,
then
down
in
--
and
left
her
in
florida.
in
order
for
her
to
get
alimony,
she'd
have
to
come
up
to
ohio
and
i
think
unless
we
have
that
rule
where
there
must
be
one
state
at
least
which
can
settle
all
the
problems
and
it
doesn't
in
any
way
overrule
or
sidetrack
the
rule
in
the
estin
case,
it
reinforces
it.
all
we
say
is
this,
that
when
estin
was
decided
and
haddock
versus
haddock
was
overruled.
what
actually
happen
was,
you
said
formally
in
haddock
that
the
state
of
the
matrimonial
domicile
had
exclusive
jurisdiction,
but
when
you
come
to
the
williams
cases
and
estin
you
say,
"oh
no."
wherever
they
go
to
establish
a
domicile,
that
can
have
--
that
state
can
have
jurisdiction
too.
but
you
don't
say
in
the
same
one
fell
sweep
and
never
have
said
and
i
hope
you'll
never
will
for.
well,
the
matrimonial
domicile
has
lost
all
its
powers
to
adjudicate,
simply
because
one
of
the
spouses
fled.
but
if
you
uphold
this
decree
of
ohio
that
would
be
the
effect
and
so
i
want
to
say
in
conclusion.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
certainly
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
if
there
would
be
ground
to
set
it
aside,
say
on
fraud
or
something
like
that,
it
could.
but
that
was
a
jurisdiction
where
it
should
have
been
determined.
i
think
if
there
was
fraud
shown
in
court
but
on
these
facts,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
we
never
had
it.
that's
would
--
we
never
had
that
matter
before.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
it
has
never
come
up
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
it's
ever
come
up.
i
don't
know
there's
one
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well
--
well,
of
course,
i
think
that
she'd
be
--
divorce
decree
in
this
case,
the
alimony
would
be
final,
the
order
of
denying
alimony,
unless,
there
was
some
change
circumstance
is
shown
and
i
think
that
florida
would
neither
the
right
to
alimony.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
that's
what
i'd
understand
of
law.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no,
i
don't
at
all.
i
don't
think
the
pawley
case
is
controlling
because
it's
different
set
of
facts.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
is
that
the
matrimonial
domicile?
that's
the
first
question.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
wouldn't
say
so
either
in
the
case
of
ohio.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
they
could
not.
i
would
say
if
it
was
a
--
the
matrimonial
domicile
of
both
parties,
then
i
don't
think
one
of
them
can
migrate
to
another
thing
and
claim
that
it's
not
res
judicata
because
i
think
there's
a
sufficient
interest.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
that's
where
he
lived.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
well,
i
would
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
if
the
defendant
did
not
live
in
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
if
the
defendant
did
not
live
in
florida,
the
defendant
could
still
get
alimony.
but
if
the
defendant
had
lived
in
florida
and
come
through
ohio,
then
i
think
the
service
by
publication
would
have
been
good.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i'm
saying
that
under
federal.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
we
have
no
cases
on
that.
this
is
never
a
reason
for
it.
the
only
case
i
know
--
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
--
is
a
kansas
case
that
mccormick
versus
mccormick.
i
don't
think
we
have
the
citation
in
our
brief
is
where
in
that
case,
the
facts
were
identical.
so,
only
when
i
know
because
most
of
the
cases
where
the
husband
goes
out
to
the
jurisdiction
and
the
wife
stays
in
the
place.
this
is
a
case
where
the
husband
stays
and
the
wife
leaves.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
would
say
it
does.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
i
would
say
so.
yes,
sir.
let's
say,
there's
not
question.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
on
additional
alimony,
yes,
under
change
circumstances.
mr.
robert
n.
gorman
no,
you
mean
in
ohio,
if
there
was
a
divorce
in
another
jurisdiction,
could
you
get
alimony?
i
would
say,
yes,
ordinarily,
yes,
ordinarily.
i
think
the
cox
case,
which
mr.
sibbald
cited
is
correct.
i
find
it
and
probably
--
and
point
at
all.
i
think
the
matter
is
a
simple
one
when
it
comes
down
to
is
this
and
i
have
never
changed
my
position
on
it.
i
have
cited
the
thompson
versus
thompson
because
if
that's
still
the
law,
this
has
to
be
reverse.
if
you're
going
to
modify
thompson
versus
thompson
just
a
little
bit,
i
still
said
it
has
to
be
reverse.
but
when
you
come
to
the
question
whether
you
have
full
faith
and
credit
or
not,
isn't
it
after
all
a
question
whether
or
not
due
process
was
rendered
in
the
florida
courts,
if
there
was
due
process
in
the
florida
courts,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
questions
are
all
over
it.
and
if
we
take
pennoyer
versus
neff
strictly,
and
we'll
not
say
anything
against
pennoyer,
then
of
course
we
lose.
but
i
say
on
a
general
theory
of
milliken
versus
meyer
and
the
easy
manner
in
which
now
we
say
minimal
contacts
there
was
due
process.
