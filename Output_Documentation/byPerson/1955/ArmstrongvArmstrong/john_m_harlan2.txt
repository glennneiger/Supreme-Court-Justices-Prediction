well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
may
make
a
difference
in
interpreting
the
scope
of
this
decree.
isn't
it
possible
to
read
the
part
of
decree
as
not
adjudicating
the
general
right
to
alimony
but
only
the
right
to
alimony
insofar
as
it
related
to
property
that
had
they
had
to
decide
this
in
florida.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
decree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you
read
that
in
relation
to
the
preceding
paragraph,
where
the
court
distinguishes
between
the
real
property
that
does
have
its
status
in
florida
and
the
other
property
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
not
described
but
it
says,
"is
subject
to
determination
in
ohio."
justice
john
m.
harlan
doesn't
that
lend
some
support,
to
reading
this
decree
as
being
limited
simply
to
her
right
to
alimony
on
the
real
property?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
bill
of
complaint
in
the
divorce,
florida
divorce
action
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
--
where
is
that
mr.
gorman?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
decree
i've
got
was
the
complaint
of
and

john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
happen
to
know
what
the
facts
of
the
trial
with
regard
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
petition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
the
ohio
complaint.
justice
john

as
the
ohio

justice
john
m.

now,
with
the
complaint
to
mr.
justice
reed
refer
to
as
in
the
ohio
action
not
to
the
florida
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then,
there
isn't
any
question
that
if
--
we
should
come
to
conclusion
that
the
florida
decree
did
not
--
the
court
deal
with
alimony
that
would
end
the
case?
