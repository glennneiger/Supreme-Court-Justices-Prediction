mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
in
this
litigation
much
longer
than
judge
gorman.
and
perhaps,
in
some
of
the
earlier
stages
of
it
i
am
more
familiar
than
him.
and
because
of
that
familiarity,
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
say
that
this
litigation
whether
it
be
and
means
two
divorce
actions
are
in
the
two
actions
that
were
brought
in
ohio
to
recover
securities
and
other
property
or,
if
you
please,
in
the
partition
action
that
all
of
this
litigation
has
been
for
it
has
been
had
for
the
principal
purpose
of
a
trial
to
the
right
of
property.
these
divorce
sections
are
more
or
less
are
side
issues.
i
ask
the
court
to
remember
that
mr.
armstrong
is
man
who
is
now
about
70
years
of
age.
mrs.
armstrong
is
about
63
years
of
age.
the
record
bears
me
out
that
neither
of
them
were
particularly
interested
in
divorce.
of
course,
neither
of
them
have
remarried.
but
they
had
gone
through
life
accumulating
a
substantial
estate.
and
as
to
the
part
of
that
estate,
transfers
had
been
made
so
that
the
properties
were
held
jointly.
as
to
the
stocks
which
the
parties
had
accumulated,
no
such
transfer
had
been
made.
go
back
as
early
as
1941,
it
had
been
contemplated.
and
there
had
been
some
correspondence
with
general
motors
principal
officers
about
the
transfer
of
general
motors
stock
to
the
joint
names.
that
did
not
result
in
such
a
transfer
because
of
the
fact
of
these
parties
who,
the
record
show,
are
inclined
to
be
miserly
both
of
them
because
of
the
expense
involved.
you
know
that
cost
them
$35
or
$40
for
transfer
stamps
in
these
to
have
transferred
this
general
motors
stock
to
them.
so,
they
came
down
to
about
the
year
1945,
where
they
had
gotten
along
fairly
well
together
and
had
accumulated
an
estate
that
--
back
in
those
days
may
have
amounted
to
as
much
as
all
$200,000
or
$250,000.
then
marital
troubles
came
along,
and
i
became
for
the
first
time,
acquainted
with
this
litigation.
in
the
summer
of
1948,
the
two
of
them,
mr.
and
mrs.
armstrong,
were
living
on
their
farm
in
clermont
county
ohio.
and
i
may
--
if
i
may,
to
digress
there
for
a
moment
and
say,
that
all
that
judge
gorman
had
said
to
you
about
matrimonial
domicile
is
just
his
--
his
opinion
as
to
where
matrimonial
domicile
was.
these
parties
had
from
many
years,
certainly
since
they
returned
from
some
fruit-growing
project
that
they
had
jointly
engaged
in
on
the
isle
of
pines,
had
lived
during
the
winter
months
in
a
residence
they
had
in
florida.
and
during
the
summer
months
in
ohio,
had
lived
either
in
hamilton
county
ohio
or
in
clermont
county
ohio
where
they
maintained
residences
in
ohio.
and
that
had
gone
on
for
years.
i'll
come
later
to
that
question
of
matrimonial
domicile
but
i
want
to
interject
that
thought.
now,
that
in
1948,
they
were
living
in
hamilton
county
ohio,
residing
there
as
they
had
for
many
years.
trouble
arose
between
them
and
armstrong
hit
his
wife
in
the
face
with
a
butt-end
of
a
revolver
and
broke
out
some
of
her
teeth.
and
she
left,
and
decided
that
she
would
not
continue
to
live
with
him
in
ohio
or
elsewhere.
now,
i
was
consulted.
and
very
shortly
after
that,
mrs.
armstrong
took
into
her
possession
from
safety
deposit
boxes
in
joint
names
and
from
bank
accounts
in
joint
names,
substantial
amounts
of
cash
and
the
securities
that
subsequently
became
the
subject
of
this
litigation,
together
with
some
jewelry
and
some
case
that
was
in
those
boxes.
armstrong
was
notified
at
once,
that
she
had
taken
that
property
into
her
possession
for
safekeeping
until
there
could
be
an
agreement
between
the
two
of
them
for
a
division
of
their
holdings.
and
the
record
shows
that
he
talked
to
me
and
was
--
he
was
advised
to
get
himself
a
good
lawyer
and
so
that
i'm
with
his
wife
and
make
that
property
settlement.
an
attempt
was
made
in
employing
counsel,
not
the
gentlemen
who
are
here
or
who
appear
on
these
briefs
but
other
counsel
in
cincinnati
at
that
time
and
an
effort
was
made
to
bring
about
a
property
settlement.
and
they
were
very
close
to
a
settlement,
satisfactory
to
both
when
they
decided
to
go
back
together
again
and
try
it
some
more.
and
the
lawyers
were
instructed
to
stop
the
litigations
and
that
a
reconciliation
had
been
brought
about.
the
record
shows
that
mrs.
armstrong
at
that
time
returned
to
their
joint
holdings,
a
very
large
part
of
the
case
that
she
had
taken
out
of
the
boxes.
she
paid
the
attorneys
fees
on
out
of
the
funds
that
she
had
taken
from
these
accounts,
paid
the
attorneys
fees
on
both
sides.
and
they
went
back
to
living
together,
in
a
winter
time
in
florida,
in
the
hot
months
in
florida
in
the
north
--
in
their
properties
in
the
north
where
they
maintained
this
northern
residence.
and
time
went
on
and
it
was
again
in
a
fall
of
1950
that
further
difficulty
came
up
between
them.
armstrong
in
the
meantime,
the
record
shows,
and
as
a
part
of
his
--
his
part
of
that
reconciliation,
had
given
to
mrs.
armstrong
a
written
letter
or
a
memorandum
in
which
he
acknowledged
to
her
that
his
behavior
in
the
past
have
not
been
what
it
should
have
been
and
in
which
he
promised
that
he
would
not
again
misbehave.
and
in
which
he
gave
to
mrs.
armstrong
the
right
to
retain
in
her
possession
these
securities
and
the
bonds
of
the
parties,
the
jewelry
that
was
in
controversy
until
such
time
as
she
saw
fit
to
return
it
to
the
possession
in
which
it
was
held
on
july
1st,
1948.
well,
it
--
it
was
in
october
of
1950,
that
armstrong
again
gave
his
wife
a
beating.
this
time
in
florida.
gave
her
such
a
beating,
that
she
again
determined
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
continue
to
live
with
him.
and
she
left
this
florida
residence
and
returned,
if
we
want
to
call
it
that,
to
ohio.
in
any
event,
she
came
to
ohio.
now,
the
securities
that
are
here
in
controversy
and
the
other
property,
during
that
interval
of
time
the
record
shows
remained
in
ohio,
in
her
possession.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
the
jewelry
is
worth
some
both
$6000
--
$6000
or
$7000
perhaps
in
jewelry.
there
was
some
--
something
perhaps
in
the
neighborhood
of
$10,000
in
cash
and
some
e-bonds.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
if
i
remember
rightly,
they
were
of
$3500
face
value.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
would
say
it
was
less
than
$20,000
outside
the
securities.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
well,
they
were
more
than
general
motors
stocks
and
i
--
it'd
be
a
little
bit
difficult
for
me
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
--
to
give
you
that
answer
because
there
were
numerous
other
small
holdings
in
stocks,
that
were
not
of
large
value.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
have
those
figures.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
well,
i
--
i
would
say
as
an
--
an
aggregate
figure
that
i
would
not
very
wrong
if
i
said
that
the
florida,
that
the
property
that
was
in
florida
was
worth
about
$20,000.
and
everything
that
was
in
ohio,
back
in
1950,
would
be
worth
let
us
say
$180,000.
it's
--
the
value
as
--
as
of
those
days.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
approximately,
half
and
half.
now,
as
i
say
mrs.
armstrong
returned
to
ohio
or
came
to
ohio
in
october
of
19
--
or
november
of
1950.
notice
was
given
to
general
motors
corporation
that
she
held
these
certificates
in
her
possession
and
claimed
that
an
interest
in
them.
general
motors
corporation,
thereupon,
notified
mr.
armstrong
that
such
a
claim
had
been
made
and
told
him
that
dividends
would
be
withheld
until
that
interest
was
determined.
then
i
got
into
correspondence
with
mr.
william
ward,
mr.
armstrong's
attorney
(inaudible)
and
the
record
shows
we
carried
on
the
correspondence
over
a
period
of
some
weeks.
again
attempting
to
make
a
settlement
of
the
property
rights
of
the
parties
that
could
not
be
agreed
upon
at
that
time
and
mr.
ward
notified
me
that
his
intention
to
bring
on
behalf
of
mr.
armstrong
an
action
for
divorce
in
florida.
and
i
notified
mr.
ward
on
behalf
of
mrs.
armstrong
that
she
had
determined,
that
she
would
not
live
further
with
her
husband,
that
because
of
his
ill
treatment,
she
had
determined
to
make
her
domicile
separate
from
his.
and
that
she
would
continue
in
the
future
to
reside
in
cincinnati
where
she
had
established
her
residence.
mr.
ward
raised
the
question
as
to
her
right
to
do
that.
and
i
pointed
out
to
him
what
i
think
was
and
thought
then
was
the
law
and
think
today
is
the
law,
whether
you
consider
from
the
standpoint
of
ohio
law
or
florida
law.
now,
that
a
wife
who
has
been
guilty
or
has
been
--
has
suffered
the
ill
treatment
that
mrs.
armstrong
suffered
at
the
hands
of
her
husband,
had
a
right
to
leave
him
and
establish
a
domicile
of
her
own.
then
mr.
ward
brought
this
action
for
a
divorce
in
florida.
mrs.
armstrong
in
order
to
bring
an
action
for
divorce
in
ohio
was
required
under
ohio
statutes
to
live
in
ohio
for
a
period
of
one
year
before
bringing
her
action.
and
as
a
result,
the
action
in
florida
for
a
divorce
was
filed,
was
pending,
and
the
decree
was
granted
before
the
expiration
of
the
year,
in
which
mrs.
armstrong
could
sue
for
a
divorce
in
ohio.
but
in
the
mean
time
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
domicile
in
ohio
and
in
florida
because
the
two
them
had
divided
their
time
between
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
but
i
want
it
covered
because
that's
their
argument,
a
matrimonial
domicile.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
she
--
that
was
a
residence
requirement.
she
had
to
be
a
resident
of
ohio
for
a
year
before
she
could
bring
an
action
for
a
divorce.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
make
a
distinction
between
domicile
and
residence.
in
other
words,
she
could
become
a
domicile
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
because
she
had
to
be
a
resident
of
ohio,
had
to
actually
live
there.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
i
think
there
is.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
don't
know
where
it
was,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
today
how
you
would
determine
where
the
matrimonial
domicile
of
these
parties
was.
i
do
know
contrary
to
what
judge
gorman
said
a
little
bit
ago,
when
he
said
that
that
argument,
that
matter
was
argued
up
fully
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
this
case
that
--
and
if
it
was
i
was
asleep
when
it
was
argued
because
i
never
heard
it
argued.
i
do
know
that
some
question
was
at
the
very
end
of
this
litigation
on
the
trial
court,
some
references
made
to
thompson
versus
thompson.
and
i
remember
judge
bell
who
would
finish
hearing
an
argument
but
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
got
up
off
the
bench,
started
towards
the
room
and
tuned
back
and
said
to
these
gentlemen
who
were
arguing
the
motion.
now,
judge
gorman,
he
wasn't
arguing
--
"what
do
you
mean
matrimonial
domicile?
these
people
were
married
in
cincinnati,
they
were
natives
here.
they
continued
to
live
here,
part
of
the
year.
what's
matrimonial
domicile
got
to
do
with
it
now?"
now,
that
was
the
--
that
was
all
the
argument
i
heard
about
matrimonial
domicile.
but
getting
back
to
the
--
to
the
matter
of
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
--
litigation
that
you
inquire.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
under
the
florida
statute,
all
he
had
to
show
was
he'd
actually
resided
there
and
lived
there
for
a
period
of
90-days.
it
showed
that.
he
had
actually
been
living
and
sleeping
there
in
florida
for
90
days
before
he
brought
this
action
so
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
that.
and
now
getting
to
this
other
litigation.
while
this
action
for
divorce
was
pending
in
florida
and
before
there
was
any
decree
in
florida,
mr.
armstrong
brought
another
action
in
ohio
in
which
he
sought
to
recover
from
mrs.
armstrong
the
securities
that
are
here
in
controversy,
and
the
jewelry,
and
the
cash.
that
action
was
pending.
judge
gorman
said
the
only
other
litigation
was
a
partition
action.
he
is
not
correct
in
that.
this
--
this
action
was
pending
throughout
the
divorce
pendency
in
florida,
in
which
mr.
armstrong
was
seeking
to
recover
these
securities
from
mrs.
armstrong.
and
if
your
honors
will
look
at
page
22
of
the
record,
you
will
find
that
when
the
court
upon
opening
the
clerk
that
morning
said,
"i
see
there
are
two
cases
here
gentleman.
are
they
to
be
tried
together?"
and
then
the
parties
stipulated
that
they
might
be
tried
together
and
that
the
judgment
in
--
would
determine
both
cases.
now,
the
two
cases
that
he
was
talking
about
was
this
action
of
mrs.
armstrong
for
a
divorce
and
for
a
division
of
property,
and
the
action
which
mr.
armstrong
had
brought,
seeking
to
recover
from
mrs.
armstrong
the
property
which
she
held
in
her
possession.
and
the
court
tried
both
of
those
cases
upon
the
testimony
in
this
record
and
under
a
stipulation
that
the
order
which
she
made
would
practically
determine
both
cases.
so,
i
am
back
to
my
original
suggestion
to
your
honors
that
this
litigation
throughout
the
time
it
has
run,
has
been
one
that
he
has
been
largely
a
trial
to
the
right
of
property
with
divorce
action
somewhat
incidental.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
points
that
i
am
making
here,
answering
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
in
their
claims.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
there
was
no
second
case
in
florida,
your
honor.
it
was
a
second
case
in
ohio,
a
civil
action
in
ohio
tried
in
addition
to
the
divorce
action
in
ohio.
there
was
only
one
case
in
florida.
now,
mr.
armstrong
got
his
decree
in
florida.
mrs.
armstrong
brought
her
action
in
ohio
and
named
the
general
motors
corporation
and
the
other
companies
whose
stocks
were
in
her
possession,
all
of
them
as
parties
defendant.
they're
not
all
brought
on
to
the
record
here
because
the
court's
final
order
related
only
to
general
motor
stock
and
we
have
not
carried
up
the
names
of
those
other
issuers
or
other
corporations
who
were
made
parties
to
her
action.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
under
a
state
statue
in
ohio.
that
in
a
divorce
action,
any
party
claiming
any
interest
or
having
any
interest
in
the
property
may
be
made
a
party
defendant.
i
have
copied
that
statute
on
page
3
of
my
brief,
"a
person
or
corporation
having
possession
of,
control
of,
or
claiming
any
interest
in
property
real
or
personal,
out
of
which
another
seeks
alimony
may
be
made
a
party
defendant."
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
that
it
may
be.
i
--
i
would
put
a
little
bit
--
differing
construction.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
i
think
that
that
statute,
is
what
is
used
there
largely
in
divorce
matters
to
preclude
the
transfer
of
property
until
such
time
as
the
court's
made
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
statute
is
broad
enough
that
it
brings
the
corporation
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
makes
that
corporation
responsible
to
obey
any
in
order
that
the
court
may
make.
so,
mrs.
armstrong
when
she
joined
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
oh,
yes
--
yes.
when
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
then
what
if
--
then
what
if
because
under
our
law
slapp
versus
slapp
is
the
last
word
on
that
wherein
the
court
for
any
reason
could
not
grant
her
a
divorce
and
may
otherwise
make
an
order
for
alimony
that
the
court
may,
as
a
part
of
that
alimony
order
make
a
division
of
property.
that
--
that
is
the
law
of
ohio
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
even
if
no
divorce
is
granted.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
think
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
make
a
maintenance
order.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
they
have
a
right
to
make
an
alimony
of
it.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
now,
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
forget
it
in
the
time
that
i
have
left.
that
in
ohio,
alimony
it
doesn't
promote
the
thing
that
we
--
ordinarily
talk
about
a
separate
maintenance
order
and
like
that.
alimony
in
ohio
includes
a
division
of
property.
in
fact,
our
court
said
that
the
right
of
the
court
to
make
a
division
of
property
while
it's
called
alimony
actually,
is
not
alimony.
that
it
is
an
exercise
of
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
that
alimony
technically
starts
only
where
the
court
makes
some
order
on
the
husband
to
pay
alimony
out
of
his
property.
not
the
part
that's
jointly
held
but
out
of
his
share
of
the
property.
so,
when
mrs.
armstrong's
petition
was
filed
in
ohio,
it
was
one
in
which
we
set
up
her
equitable
claim
to
a
division
of
this
property
and
sought
an
order
against
the
corporations,
requiring
them
to
reissue
that
stock
in
such
division
as
the
court
equitably
found
the
ownership
to
be.
and
that
out
of
mr.
armstrong's
share,
after
making
that
equitable
division,
that
mrs.
armstrong
be
allowed
alimony.
that
was
the
--
that
was
our
petition
and
our
amended
petition
and
contrary
to
what
judge
gorman
said,
that
i'm
sure
he
had
said
it
unintentional.
our
petition
was
not
one
to
set
aside
this
florida
decree.
there
is
nothing,
no
prayer
that
that
decree
be
set
aside.
when
i
drew
that
original
petition
and
the
amended
petition,
i
had
in
mind
the
possibility
that
this
decree
of
divorce
was
not
entitled
to
pay
any
credit
because
it
had
been
obtained
on
false
and
fraudulent
testimony.
and
for
a
time
in
this
case,
i
presume
that
thought
was
subsequently
amended
because
while
i
--i'm
not
so
sure
that
--
that
we
haven't
the
right
to
pursue
that
question,
i
know
that
his
honor
--
judge
--
justice
frankfurter
has
referred
to
it
at
time
or
two
in
some
of
the
opinions
he's
written.
the
question
may
be
somewhat
an
open
one
in
this
court
whether
a
decree
or
a
judgment
obtained
upon
fraudulent
and
false
testimony
going
to
the
merits
rather
than
to
jurisdiction
may
--
may
not
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
but
i
--
i
didn't
pursue
that
question
beyond
the
--
the
trial
question.
perhaps,
beyond
the
court
of
appeals,
i
should
say.
but
i
did
in
that
petition
make
one
further
claim,
that
i
have
made
in
each
of
the
courts
below
and
that
i'm
making
here.
and
i
--
and
i
think
it's
one
that
presents
a
question
that
should
excite
this
court
to
consideration
of
it
because
it
--
it
is
of
such
importance
that
i
had
felt
that
at
no
time
should
i
abandon
it.
and
that
is,
that
this
decree
was
not
entitled
to
pay
some
credit,
any
part
of
it
because
of
the
manner
in
which
it
was
heard
in
florida
before
a
master
commissioner
who
apparently
was
in
the
pay
of
the
attorney
for
the
florida
plaintiff.
i
want
to
come
to
that
a
little
bit
later.
the
case
was
entered.
after
a
time,
mr.
armstrong
entered
his
appearance
and
filed
his
answer.
and
in
that
answer,
he
pleaded
that
florida
divorce
decree
as
res
judicata
of
the
right
of
the
ohio
court
to
grant
a
divorce.
and
then,
in
his
answer
set
up
the
facts
on
which
he
claimed
that
the
ohio
court
should
not
grant
alimony
to
mrs.
armstrong
and
should
not
make
any
division
of
property.
at
no
place
in
that
answer
did
he
claim
that
this
florida
decree
had
denied
her
alimony
or
that
it
was
res
judicata
of
her
right
to
alimony
and
through
out
the
trial
of
this
case
and
until
after
judgment
was
entered
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court,
not
one
word
was
said,
anywhere,
by
anybody,
that
this
florida
decree
was
res
judicata
as
to
the
right
of
mrs.
armstrong
to
alimony.
after
the
court
had
heard
the
testimony,
after
he'd
entered
his
decree,
then
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
filed.
and
then
for
the
first
time,
judge
gorman
came
into
the
matter
and
we
heard
that
thompson
versus
thompson
raised
upon
the
suggestion
made
to
the
court
that
judge
gorman
had
been
--
had
been
employed
to
take
an
appeal
of
the
matter
and
would
depend
upon
matrimonial
domicile
that
the
plaintiff's,
that
the
husband's
residence
in
florida
was
the
matrimonial
domicile
and
that
under
thompson
versus
thompson
the
court
in
ohio
could
not
grant
her
alimony.
now,
there
was
no
amendment
of
the
pleading
and
no
plea
of
res
judicata,
tendered
it
that
time
on
and
anytime
prior
to
the
actual
appeal.
but
the
matter
went
into
the
court
of
appeals
or
intermediate
appellate
court
upon
the
theory
that
full
faith
and
credit
was
a
rule
of
law
that
precluded
the
ohio
court
from
granting
alimony.
well,
as
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
presents
a
rule
of
evidence.
res
judicata
is
a
defense,
may
be
injected
in
the
case
of
law
and
equity.
but
the
proof
of
that
defense
of
res
judicata
may
be
made
by
the
production
of
a
record
which
if
in
good
form,
rendered
by
a
court
that
had
jurisdiction,
must
be
given
conclusive
effect
as
proof
of
the
defense
of
res
judicata.
that
wasn't
done
in
this
case.
and
since
it
wasn't
done
in
this
case
and
has
never
been
done
in
this
case,
i
--
i
am
suggesting
in
my
brief,
that
there
is
no
question
here
of
full
faith
and
credit
preserved
in
the
court
below
or
in
the
courts
below
that
give
to
this
court
jurisdiction
of
a
properly
presented
federal
question.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
the
court
made
it
all
in
one
order,
your
honor.
allowed
her
to
retain
all
of
the
cash
that
she
still
possessed
that
it
originally
been
taken
from
the
boxes
in
48,
the
jewelry
that
was
in
her
possession,
the
bonds
that
where
in
her
possession,
the
bonds
and
1250
shares
of
the
$5
par
value
general
motors
stock.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
that's
the
point.
it
was
intended.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
oh,
it
was
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
--
the
decree
was
tendered
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
to
your
honor.
res
judicata
as
to
the
diverse
plea
as
to
the
granting
of
a
divorce
was
pleaded.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
or
the
divorce
--
or
the
divorce
which
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
at
the
middle
paragraph
on
page
8.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
--
of
the
record,
transfer
to
the
record.
said
court
granted
an
absolute
divorce
to
this
defendant
from
the
plaintiff
for
which
no
appeal
was
taken.
the
same
has
become
final
and
absolute
and
that
by
reason
there
plaintiff
cannot
maintain
this
action
against
said
defendant
for
a
divorce.
and
--
and
then
in
drawing
the
answer,
counsel
proceeds
to
make
allegations
of
fact
on
which
he
says
that
the
court
should
not
grant
her
alimony.
but
he
had
no
place
in
his
answer
that
says
that
that
divorce
decree
denied
her
alimony
or
that
it
was
res
judicata
against
the
claim
which
he
was
making
in
her
amended
petition.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes,
sir.
that
the
plea
of
res
judicata
arising
out
of
the
florida
decree
was
well
taken
and
that
our
clients,
my
client,
go
on
to
make
testimony
before
the
court,
was
entitled
to
a
divorce,
could
not
have
it
because
of
the
previous
decree
in
florida.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
that's
right.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
if
the
florida
decree
were
to
--
to
be
determined
as
having
--
a
--a
court
having
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon
that
question
and
having
actually
passed
on
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
as
we
see
it.
no,
your
honor.
pardon
for
several
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
if
we
apply
both
florida
and
ohio
law,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no
because
that
was
a
personal
right
of
hers.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
not
unless
this
court
should
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
not
--
not
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
if
i
may
answer
your
honor's
question
in
this
way.
the
florida
decree
does
not
deprive
her
of
a
right
to
separate
maintenance.
let's
call
it
that
instead
of
alimony.
unless
this
court
should
now
or
subsequently
come
to
say,
that
a
decree
for
divorce
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding
may
terminate
that
personal
right
of
a
life
to
support
which
he
subsequently
attempts
to
invoke
in
a
court
--
in
another
jurisdiction
or
in
the
same
jurisdiction.
now,
under
ohio
law
and
under
florida
law
it
does
not
terminate
that
personal
right
that
she
has.
and
that
--
well,
there
--
there
has
been
some
cases
as
judge
gorman
said
where
some
courts
have
held
that
that
personal
right
has
terminated.
you
had
it
before
you
in
the
estin
in
one
case.
pennsylvania
offers,
that
the
right
to
support
is
merely
an
incident
of
the
marriage
relation
and
is
terminated
by
the
granting
of
a
decree.
and
you,
at
least,
inferentially,
and
that
he
has
said
that
the
granting
of
a
decree
by
a
state
having
the
domicile
of
the
party
seeking
a
divorce
would
under
the
florida
--
under
the
pennsylvania
court,
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
since
it
did
not
survive
against
the
right
to
support,
did
not
survive
that
a
full
faith
and
credit
would
preclude
the
wife
and
subsequently
seeking
separate
maintenance.
now,
other
courts
have
held
differently.
the
most
recent
one
and
the
most
--
well,
presently,
widely
quoted
one
is
the
hopson
case
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
district
of
columbia
that
was
decided
in
january
of
1955.
now,
where
that
courts
sitting
en
banc,
six
of
the
eight
judges
concurring
said
that
in
applying
estin
versus
estin
to
two
cases
that
they
have
pending
in
that
court
where
wives
are
seeking
to
have
--
does
have
separate
maintenance
after
the
granting
of
decrees
and
other
jurisdictions.
they
said
that
they
make
no
distinction
between
a
decree
granted
or
a
judgment
for
a
separate
maintenance
granted
before
the
decree
in
the
foreign
state
and
an
action
brought
to
secure
a
separate
maintenance
brought
after
the
decree
in
the
foreign
state.
but
in
ohio
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
think
she
would
have
a
right
to
maintain
her
action.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
in
view
of
the
pawley
case.
yes,
sir.
and
as
that
pawley
case
is
directly
down
the
line
on
it.
and
it
is
in
accordance
with
other
cases
in
florida.
because,
say
what
you
may
about
this
decree
whether
it
does
or
it
does
not
grant
or
deny
alimony.
the
law
in
florida
is
and
has
been
for
all
times,
so
far
as
i
know,
that
a
florida
court
may
not
on
constructive
service
grant
alimony.
that
case
that
arose
a
number
of
years
ago
on
another
ohio,
an
old
doctor
who
lived
in
ohio
and
got
a
divorce
in
ohio.
his
wife
lived
down
in
florida
and
got
a
divorce
in
florida.
and
she
sought
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
the
or
she
sought
in
her
action
for
a
divorce
to
have
the
court
award
her
alimony
upon
constructive
service.
and
the
court,
the
lower
courts
granted
that
prayer
for
alimony.
but
the
florida
supreme
court
had
set
to
decide.
that's
the
case
of
lucian
versus
southern
ohio
savings
bank
&
trust
company
which
is
quoted
in,
i
think,
both
briefs.
but
the
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
yes,
your
honor.
that's
one
in
which
the
court
said
that
it
couldn't
--
that
--
that
florida
could
not
grant
alimony
on
constructive
search.
but
now,
there's
another
question
that's
involved,
in
that.
that
i
set
out
in
my
brief
and
then
i
think
is
equally,
if
not
of
greater
importance.
and
that
is,
i
know
of
no
authority
in
florida
law
or
a
court
in
florida
on
the
petition
of
a
husband
to
deny
the
wife
alimony
in
any
case,
except
if
possible
that
he
is
where
the
granting
of
a
decree
in
and
of
itself,
destroying
as
it
does
the
marital
ties
would
destroy
an
incident
a
marriage
to
wit,
separate
maintenance
rights.
but
except
as
those
rights
are
founded
only
in
the
right
of
support,
i
know
of
no
case
in
florida
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
that
authorizes
any
court
upon
the
petition
of
a
husband
to
enter
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
his
wife
who
hasn't
appeared
and
who
hasn't
made
any
claim,
is
not
entitled
to
alimony.
i
know
judge
gorman
will
say,
“oh,
that's
what
the
court
said,
decided
in
thompson
versus
thompson.”
well,
it
isn't
there.
that
was
not
decided
in
thompson
versus
thompson.
thomson
versus
thompson
was
not
actually
a
divorce
case
as
we
know
divorces
today.
it
was
an
action
for
a
divorce,
(inaudible)
it
didn't
dissolve
the
marriage
ties.
mrs.
thompson
who
was
living
over
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
mr.
thompson
who
was
living
in
virginia
both
before
and
after
that
decree
remained
husband
and
wife.
but
under
the
law
of
virginia
as
at
existed
at
that
time
mr.
thompson
could
go
in
and
seek
an
order
of
a
court
which
in
effect
would
deny
his
right
--
his
wife
the
right
to
sleep
in
his
bed
or
to
eat
at
his
table.
and
that's
all
he
did.
he
got
such
an
order
from
the
court
in
virginia.
his
wife
subsequently,
obtained
the
service
of
process
on,
even
the
district
of
columbia
and
an
action
which
she
was
a
attempting
to
maintain
for
separate
maintenance.
and
the
ultimate
decision
in
that
case
was
that
she
could
not
maintain
that
action
for
a
separate
maintenance
because
under
the
law
of
virginia,
not
what
the
court
said
in
that
divorce
decree
but
under
the
law
of
virginia,
a
wife
who
was
at
fault
could
not
have
alimony.
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
griffin
case,
that
--
that
he
reached
the
proper
view
of
that
case
when
he
made
reference
to
it
and
said
that
that
case
actually
was
decided,
not
upon
a
full
faith
and
credit
question
involving
a
judgment
but
it
was
rather
upon
a
conflict
of
law.
the
law
of
virginia
was,
that
she
could
not
have
support
if
she
had
left
her
husband.
whereas,
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
might
well
have
been
that
she
could
have
them.
now,
when
we
started
through
the
lower
appeals
courts,
judge
gorman
depended
entirely
upon
thompson
versus
thompson
as
his
authority.
when
he
said
this
is
a
matrimonial
domicile
and
matrimonial
domicile
was
in
florida
and
ohio
had
no
right
to
enter
a
judgment
in
favor
of
mrs.
armstrong.
and
he
maintained
that
position
until,
i
think,
he
filed
his
reply
brief
in
this
court.
and
then
for
the
first
time,
he
--
he
seems
to
stray
away
from
that
thought
and
to
say
that
he
places
his
dependance
here,
upon
his
claim
that
the
proceedings
in
florida
gave
to
mrs.
armstrong,
due
process
of
law.
and
therefore,
they
should
be
sustained.
well,
now,
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
that
due
process
as
of
law.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
oh,
no.
we
--
we
did
not
seek
to
attack
the
decree
in
this
instance.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
no.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
no.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
no.
we
depended
upon
pawley
versus
pawley
as
to
the
law
of
florida,
slapp
versus
slapp
as
to
the
law
of
ohio
for
our
claim
that
the
florida
court,
if
it
had
a
right
to
grant
her
a
divorce,
could
divorce
--
a
right
to
grant
him
a
divorce
could
divorce
her.
but
it
couldn't
deny
her
alimony
because
she
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
so
far
as
her
personal
rights
were
concerned
or
her
property
rights.
and
in
that
connection,
may
i
suggest
one
of
the
--
your
honors,
asked
judge
gorman
the
question
about
the
law
of
ohio.
when
this
court
decided
the
first
williams
case,
holding
that
it
would
recognize,
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
the
right
of
any
court
having
jurisdiction
of
one
of
the
parties
who
was
properly
domiciled,
and
granted
divorce,
that
all
other
states
should
recognize
but
indicating
that
such
could
not
apply
to
property
rights.
this
court
was
not
saying
something
it
was
new
to
what
has
long
been
the
law
of
ohio.
because
in
1869,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
decided
the
very
question,
that
has
since,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
referring
to
divisible
divorce
should
come
in
to
national
prominence
decided
exactly
as
this
court
has
decided
on
that
subject
of
divisible
divorce.
that
ohio
would
recognize
the
right
of
any
other
state
having
one
of
the
parties
domiciled
in
its
boundaries
to
grant
a
divorce
but
would
deny
to
that
other
state
the
right
to
have
it's
jurisdiction
extend
beyond
it's
boarders
and
affect
property
rights
in
ohio.
and
through
out
the
years,
almost
80
years
since
that
first
case
of
cox
versus
cox
in
the
19th
ohio
state
was
decided
it
has
been
the
unbroken
law
of
ohio,
that
ohio
applies
what
has
come
to
be
called
the
rule
of
divisible
divorce.
that
a
divorce
maybe
granted
to
protect
offspring
or
subsequent
wives
or
innocent
parties
but
it
cannot
be,
it
cannot
have
the
effect
of
destroying
property
or
personal
rights.
now,
one
word
if
i
may,
in
answer
to
the
some
of
the
things
that
was
said
by
judge
gorman
and
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions
of
the
court
about,
what
this
florida
decree
actually
does.
as
i
see
it,
it
didn't
decide
anything.
and
in
that
connection
it
should
be
read
together
with
the
master's
report.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
page
243.
no,
244,
at
the
middle
paragraph.
now,
this
is
the
master's
report
the
question
of
the
wife's
alimony,
if
any,
cannot
be
determined
that
this
stage
of
the
proceeding.
and
then
goes
on
to
say,
that
she
has
in
her
possession
these
bonds
and
stocks,
and
money.
in
addition
thereto,
she
has
half
interest
in
properties
in
the
state
of
ohio.
so,
the
statements
of
judge
gorman
made
that
the
reference
in
the
ohio
--
florida
courts
was
only
to
the
partition
action
is
not
correct.
i
assume
that
this
will
be
the
subject
matter
of
litigation
in
ohio
and
that
the
properties
position
will
be
made
by
the
courts
of
that
state.
and
then,
the
final
decree
of
the
court,
which
was
entered
the
next
day
after
that
master's
report,
was
filed
does
not
in
anyway
change
that.
it
merely
recognized
as
has
been
pointed
out
that
this
litigation
was
pending
in
ohio
and
that
the
ohio
courts
would
have
the
right
to
make
settlement
of
the
property
rights
of
the
parties
in
ohio.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
i
--
i
take
it
that
your
honors,
that
it
was
made
--
it
was
put
in
there
largely
as
a
--
a
recognition
that
the
court
couldn't
make
any.
i
don't
see
any
other
place
that
it
would
have
in
the
case
unless,
it
was
put
there
purposely.
as
i
have
said
in
another
branch
in
my
brief,
to
create
questions
that
would
subsequently
arise
in
ohio.
because
i
think
that
both
the
master
commission
and
mr.
william
ward
who
appeared
as
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
were
fully
cognizant
for
a
fact.
now,
that
florida
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
to
defy
this
property.
mrs.
armstrong
was
not
before
the
court,
general
motors
corporation
was
not
before
the
court
and
the
security
themselves
were
not
in
florida.
mr.
ward
is
a
very
--
very
good
lawyer.
and
he's
a
good
strategist.
and
he
knows
this
subject.
he
was
counsel
for
mrs.
pawley
in
the
pawley
case.
so,
he
was
not
unfamiliar
with
what
he
was
doing.
he
was
skirting
all
the
way
around
this
question
in
--
in
this
proceeding
--
the
--
to
--
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
and
the
moment
of
starting
for
the
recess,
i
was
referring
to
mr.
ward's
in
connection
with
the
filing
of
this
master's
report.
on
page
11
of
the
respondent's
brief,
i
have
quoted
from
his
testimony
when
he
appeared
as
a
witness
in
this
case
and
i
asked
him
if
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
preparation
of
the
master's
report
in
florida.
and
he
answered,
“oh,
definitely,
yes,
sure.”
then
i
asked
him
whether
he
took
any
part
in
the
preparation
of
that
report
and
his
answer
was,
“i
do
not
recall
whether
i
did
or
not”.
then,
i
called
his
attention
to
a
sentence
at
the
end
of
that
report,
a
special
master's
fee
in
this
cause
is
settled
by
an
agreement
between
counsel
for
plaintiff
and
your
master.
and
when
i
asked
him
when
he
had
that
agreement
after
being
evasive
for
at
least
one
answer,
he
finally
said,
“i
imagined
it
was
about
the
time
he
was
ready
to
file
the
report.”
and
when
i
asked
him
how
much
he
paid
the
master
under
this
private
agreement,
he
said,
“it
was
either
$200
or
$250.”
and
the
record
shows
that
customarily
in
florida,
master
commissioner
in
uncontested
divorce
action
are
paid
under
the
order
of
the
court,
a
fee
of
$25.
now,
i
say
that
it
is
a
matter
of
serious
concern
where
we
are
in
considering
the
full
faith
and
credit
or
due
process
of
law
that
are
involved
in
this
florida
decree,
whether
a
report
filed
by
the
master
upon
which
the
court
makes
its
order
under
those
circumstances
is
due
process
of
law.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
in
florida,
i
copied
the
statute,
where
there's
no
--
no
arrangement
made
for
this.
it
shall
be
fixed
by
an
order
of
the
court.
that's
the
statute
that
i
copied
into
my
brief.
so,
i
--
i
say
to
your
honors
that
i
--
i
still
--
still
seriously
appeal
that
this
entire
decree,
this
entire
proceeding
in
florida
was
not
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
but
whether
that
be
true
or
not,
it
wasn't
in
this
case
until
after
the
question
as
to
whether
it
was,
was
not
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court
and
was
not
considered
either
as
a
matter
of
the
pleadings
or
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
now,
counsel
for
mr.
armstrong
here
in
his
replied
brief
says
that,
when
i
quote
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
armstrong
and
the
trial
court
wherein
they
admit
it
that
they
were
just
two
questions
in
this
case.
first,
whether
the
court
could
grant
a
divorce
and
secondly,
whether
it
could
make
a
division
of
property,
where
they
agreed
with
me
that
those
were
the
two
cases.
mr.
--
or
judge
gorman
in
his
brief
says,
“oh,
i
just
took
a
sentence
out
of
context.”
now,
in
order
that
there'll
be
--
be
no
question
about
that
as
to
whether
that
was
the
matter
--
the
means
upon
which
this
case
was
tried
in
the
lower
court.
i
have
had
printed
and
have
left
with
the
clerk
the
required
number
of
copies
of
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
armstrong
in
the
trial
court
wherein
it
was
agreed
by
all
concerned
that
there
were
two
questions
before
the
court.
first,
whether
the
court
could
grant
a
divorce.
secondly,
whether
the
court
could
make
a
division
of
property.
and
i'm
asking
(inaudible)
now
to
have
that
copy
of
the
brief
filed
here
as
a
supplement
to
my
brief
rather
than
have
it
appear
in
this
record
that
i
haven't
stated
it
by
just
pulling
a
sentence
out
of
context.
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
now,
may
i
--
my
--
finish
my
argument
with
just
this
thought,
your
honor?
mr.
walter
k.
sibbald
the
--
the
petitioner
here
started
out
in
this
case
depending
as
i
have
said
upon
thompson
versus
thompson,
you
will
not
be
apparently
today
and
in
his
reply
brief,
it's
shifted
away
from
that
and
says
that
he
claims
now
that
there
--
there
was
due
process
of
law.
but
if
thompson
versus
thompson
were
the
basis
of
his
claim,
then
i
--
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
isn't
anything
that
this
court
has
said
in
either
of
the
two
williams
cases
or
in
any
of
the
other
cases
that
have
come
up
here
involving
the
subject
of
divisible
divorce
or
ex
parte
divorce
that
would
warrant
this
court
in
holding
that
a
decree
such
as
was
entered
in
thompson
versus
thompson
by
the
virginia
court
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
because
of
the
reasons
that
you
have
given
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
ex
parte
divorce
decrees
that
have
been
before
this
court.
you
said
that
as
a
matter
of
practicality,
making
due
process
of
law
and
full
faith
and
credit
coincide
as
it
where
in
order
to
protect
innocent
persons
and
legitimacy
of
children
that
divorce
decrees
must
be
given
faith
and
credit.
thompson
versus
thompson
involved
no
such
decree.
it
did
not
dissolve
the
marital
relationship
and
therefore,
it
would
not
be
entitled
the
full
faith
and
credit
for
the
reasons
that
you
have
given
in
these
other
cases.
