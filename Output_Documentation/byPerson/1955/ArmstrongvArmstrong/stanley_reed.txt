justice

where
--
where
was
the
site
of
his
stocks,
you
find
that
the
entry
of
the
florida
decree.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
the
physical
site
is
entitled,
you
think,
was
in
florida?
justice
stanley
reed
the
florida
title
was
no
question.
he
had
to
pay
taxes
on
it.
they
were
unendorsed.
they
were
in
his
name.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
she
takes
the
certificates
and
takes
him
to
ohio,
gave
the
ohio
court
jurisdiction
because
you
immediately
get
to
the
proposition,
well
let's
take
it
away.
and
i
don't
think
it
gives
it
by
wrongful
conversion.
and
that's
what
the
florida
court
holds.
i
don't
think
it
gives
ohio
court
jurisdiction
because,
as
i
say,
she
purloins
the
certificate.
justice
stanley
reed
if
they
have
been
endorsed,
that
would
be
a
different
question.
they
were
unendorsed
entirely
and
he
paid
the
taxes
there.
but
what
i
say
then
again,
if
you
can't
settle
in
any
jurisdiction,
then
you
have
another
problem.
let
us
take
this
thing.
supposed
we've
never
get
beyond,
i
suppose,
beyond
(inaudible)
which
was
filed
many
years
later,
after
the
original
decree
was
granted.
suppose
mrs.
armstrong
had
not
filed
this
suit
four
months
afterwards.
and
you
must
remember
the
time
that
this
decree
was
entered.
she
have
not
lived
in
ohio
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
obtain
a
divorce.
she
did
not
have
the
residence
requirements
at
the
time
this
decree
was
granted.
she
could
then
wait
20
years.
he
might
be
remarried
again.
and
she
can
still
bring
action
because
you
would
say,
well
there
was
no
in
personam
jurisdiction
in
florida.
you'd
never
haved
any
stability.
your
matters
of
migratory
divorce
come
worse
and
worse.
and
it
is
--
this
is
what
i
call
is
a
step
beyond
estin.
and
i
don't
think,
under
those
circumstances
the
doctrine
of
divisible
divorce
should
apply.
now,
we
say
that
very
frankly,
because
we
believe
that
florida
had
the
dominant
interest.
they
were
married
for
22
years.
we
say
in
addition
to
that,
that
she
was
served
by
publication
in
accordance
with
the
florida
statutes,
which
were
reasonably
calculated
to
give
her
notice.
that
she
actually
did
have
notice.
and
she
deliberately
refuse
to
appear.
now,
that
is
shown
i
mean
by
that
exhibit
as
i
said,
on
page
303,
where
she
deliberately
refused
to
appear.
now,
what
happens
in
raising
this
question?
they
raised
the
question
by
attempting
to
set
aside
both
the
florida
and
the
divorce
decree
(inaudible)
and
the
burden
was
on
them.
now,
i
am
going
to
be
very
frank.
that
this
case
entirely
depends
upon
the
question
on
whether
or
not
there
was
due
process.
if
there
wasn't
due
process,
if
there
was
not
due
process,
say
in
florida,
then
ohio
court
ought
to
be
affirmed.
but
if
there
was
due
process,
if
it
satisfied
the
minimal
demands,
where
the
interest
of
florida
was
dominant,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
question
that
ohio
owes
the
duty
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
entire
decree,
and
not
just
part
of
it.
and
we
submit,
your
honors,
on
that
matter,
that
this
case
should
be
reversed.
we
have
brought
up
cases
like
may
versus
anderson,
which
can
readily
be
distinguished,
because
a
decree
for
custody,
is
one
that
is
purely
ambulatory.
there's
no
finality
to
it.
it
could
really
be
attacked
in
any
jurisdiction.
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
about
the
finality
of
this
decree
of
divorce
and
decree
of
no
alimony?assuming
that
was
the
decree
in
florida,
how
final
was
that?
justice
stanley
reed
but
she
can
attack
it
only
under
changed
circumstances?
justice
stanley
reed
suppose
she
had
that
the
florida
decree
did
not
carry
a
decree
of
alimony
and
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
carried
none
at
all.
justice
stanley
reed
still
be
open.
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
kind
of
a
decree
did
you
get
in
ohio?
did
you
get
a
division
of
property
and
then
as
against
his
property,
a
decree
for
alimony?
justice
stanley
reed
on
the
page
17
of
the
record,
there's
that
little
paragraph,
the
court
denies
divorce
to
your
desire
that
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
a
divorce
in
florida,
as
i
understand.
justice
stanley
reed
and
on
the
next
page,
after
having
declared
that
the
florida
decree
was
valid
in
the
6th
paragraph,
they
held
that
mary
r.armstrong
is
entitled
to
alimony.
justice
stanley
reed
now,
if
--
if
the
florida
decree
is
construed
to
determine
the
question
of
alimony
then
that
this
alimony
would
necessarily
follow
would
it
not?
justice
stanley
reed
the
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
divorce
then.
justice
stanley
reed
that
in
your
--
and
your
higher
courts
said
it
there?
justice
stanley
reed
now
then,
if
it
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
divorce
then
it
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
right
for
alimony?
justice
stanley
reed
i'm
not
talking
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
ownership
of
property.
i'm
talking
about
the
alimony
that
husband
owes
to
the
wife.
justice
stanley
reed
well
--
well
then,
she'd
lose
that
in
the
florida
divorce?
justice
stanley
reed
did
she
have
a
right
to
the
general
motor
stock.
that
--
that's
what's
involved.
justice
stanley
reed
what
you
called
a
few
moments
ago
alimony?
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
that
taken
to
this
case
to
florida
after
the
decree
has
been
entered
in
the
case
heard
was
free
from
further
support
and
for
the
decision
of
this
property
of
--
makes
you
deal
in
ohio.
what
would
be
the
florida
law
with
that?
justice
stanley
reed
well
that's
--
that's
the
view
of
pawley
case?
justice
stanley
reed
are
you
familiar
with
peacock
case
in
florida?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
you
first
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
first
take
the
prayer
of
the
complaint.
justice
stanley
reed
if
you
first
take
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
on
page

--
justice
stanley
reed
--
of
the
record.
justice
stanley

what
--
what
did
they
--
what
did
they
pray
for
their
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
what's
that?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

--
didn't
grant
division
of
stock?
justice
stanley
reed
this
is
ohio
too,
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
one
with
--
a
question
of
whether
florida
could
--
could
drop
alimony
after
the
event,
the
valid
divorce.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

--
the
divorce
in
place?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
--
if
this
could
have
been
done
in
florida,
as
same
suit
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
it
should
have
been
brought
and
if
they
have
the
exactly
the
same
result
that
there
was
in
ohio.
justice
stanley
reed
wouldn't
that
be
or
would
it
be
in
your
party
and
in
your
views
in
following
of
the
florida
decree
in
the
pawley
case?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
--
justice
stanley
reed
assume
the
pawley
case
has
taken
place
in
ohio.
first,
--
justice
stanley
reed
no.
justice
stanley
reed
they
were
there
long
enough
to
get
a
divorce
in
nevada.
(voice

justice
stanley
reed
on
the
change
of
circumstance?
