mr.
james
m.
estabrook
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
am
the
counsel
for
two
of
the
three
respondents,
kerr
steamship
company,
a
local
corporation
of
an
office
in
new
york,
and
i'm
for
the
party
of
records,
oivind
lorentzen,
as
director
of
shipping
and
curator
of
the
royal
norwegian
government
doing
business
under
the
name
and
style
of
the
norwegian
shipping
and
trade
mission.
in
fact,
i
now
represent
the
norwegian
government.
mr.
lorentzen
has
long
since
gone
back
in
the
private
practice
and
the
norwegian
shipping
and
trade
mission
was
--
which
was
the
wartime
agency
similar
to
our
war
shipping
administration
has
been
dissolved.
but
the
royal
norwegian
government
did,
through
mr.
lorentzen,
owned
and
operate
the
heogh
silvercloud
in
september
of
1945.
the
vessel
itself
has
never
been
seized
and
there
has
been
no
claim
filed
for
it.
to
review
the
legal
pleadings,
when
libelant
filed
his
libel
in
1952
for
an
accident
in
1945,
we,
first
of
all,
filed
exceptions
and
accepted
allegations
for
the
defendant,
kerr.
a
--
answering
affidavit
was
filed
by
mr.
baker
representing
mr.
czaplicki.
on
our
exceptions
and
verified
accepted
allegations,
the
libel
was
dismissed
as
to
kerr.
a
decree
was
entered
dismissing
the
libel
as
to
kerr
and
notice
of
appeal
was
duly
filed
and
then
the
libelants
time
to
appeal
was
extended
by
stipulation.
after
that,
a
motion
was
made
by
the
defendant,
hamilton,
which
had
answered.
no,
i
beg
--
but
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
most
was
made
for
the
libelant
to
strike
a
defense
from
the
answer
of
the
defendant,
hamilton.
we
were
given
notice
of
the
motion
but
we
did
not
participate
in
the
argument.
that
motion
followed
--
decision
of
that
motion
followed
the
decision
of
judge
sugarman,
who
granted
our
exceptions.
in
behalf
of
kerr,
he
dismissed
the
liable
and
sustained
the
special
defense.
we
also
filed
exceptions
and
exceptive
allegations
on
behalf
of
the
owners
of
the
vessel.
but
the
hearing
on
these
exceptions
and
exceptive
allegations
was
adjourned
from
time
to
time
until
the
matter
came
on
for
trial.
we
had
not
answered.
at
the
trial,
the
trial
judge,
on
receiving
any
evidence,
certain
papers
submitted
by
the
libelant
and
on
hearing
libelants
counsel,
and
on
the
issue
of
whether
libelant
was
the
proper
party
to
sue,
dismissed
the
libel
before
we
put
any
--
in
any
evidence
on
behalf
of
norwegian
shipping
and
trade
mission
and
before
the
respondent
putting
any
evidence
on
behalf
of
hamilton.
it
is
true
as
mr.
chazen
states
that
there
was
no
evidence
by
the
defendant
on
the
part
of
laches
and
there
was
no
evidence
put
in
by
the
plaintiff,
by
the
libelant,
rather,
to
explain
his
delay
of
seven
years
in
filing
a
libel
and
no
evidence
as
to
extenuating
circumstances.
our
pleadings
plead
the
defense
of
laches
and
our
kerr
exceptions.
judge
sugarman
did
not
pass
on
the
issue
merely
decided
the
assignment
was
valid,
libelant
was
the
wrong
party
to
sue.
our
exceptions
on
behalf
of
the
norwegian
shipping
and
trade
mission
referred
to
the
kerr
opinion,
and
we
annexed
as
part
of
the
exceptive
allegations
to
our
pleadings.
despite
this
fact,
laches
wasn't
mentioned
by
judge
ryan
on
the
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
brief
the
question
of
the
assignment
primarily
on
the
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
the
question
of
laches.
now,
our
view
on
laches,
the
norwegian
government
is
this,
since
the
district
court
decided
the
libelant
was
--
did
not
have
the
power
to
sue,
having
assigned
this
cause
of
action,
anything
he
did,
without
having
a
cause
of
action,
can't
help
him
or
hurt
him.
if
it
should
be
found
that
he
is
the
proper
party
libelant,
then
in
our
answer,
we
would
plea
laches,
we
would
state
that
the
new
york
statute
of
limitation
should
be
applied
by
analogy,
absent
to
any
extenuating
circumstances
and
after
aid
is
three
years.
but
we
don't
really
see
how
it
makes
much
difference
on
the
laches
issue
now
because,
mr.
justice,
if
i
sue
without
any
right
to
sue
for
pledges
of
czaplicki's
injuries.
whatever
i
did
could
have
no
effect
on
his
rights
and
whatever
he
did
could
have
no
effect
on
the
rights
to
recover
which
are
base
that
we
claim
in
hamilton
marine
due
to
the
effective
award.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well
it's
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
if
--
if
you,
then,
you
would
have
to
decide,
if
he
had
standing
to
sue
for
ab
initio,
your
honor?
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
then
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
he
had,
one,
under
the
doctrine
of
gardner
against
panama
railroad
pleaded
and
proved
them
extenuating
circumstances
explaining
his
delay.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
and
two,
whether
he
had
a
chance
to
do
so.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
the
--
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
anything
further
--
i
mean,
excuse
me
sir,
counsel
was
asked
whether
counsel
had
any
further
proof,
counsel
wish
to
submit
and
counsel
said
no.
now
to
cover
the
question
of
the
award
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
not,
as
far
as
we
know,
your
honor.
i've
seen
no
copies
of
any
letters
or
any
such
demand.
you
see
we
have
no
--
i
have
no
connection
with
the
employer
or
with
travelers
or
with
the
hamilton
marine.
our
position
is
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
i
had,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
it's
on
page
9
--
but
as
you're
--
justice
harlan
is
right
on
that
point
because
there
was
a
swirl
of
the
question.
i
underlined
one
part
and
not
the
other.
the
court,
"libelant
has
no
further
proof
to
offer."
mr.
baker,
"on
this?"
the
court,
"on
the
special
trial
which
we
are
conducting
first
of
the
issues
raised
for
the
separate
offense."
mr.
baker,
"that
isn't
all
in
that
issue."
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
i
apologize,
your
honors,
i'd
underlined
nothing
further
to
offer
and
i
hadn't
quoted
down
below.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
award,
the
royal
norwegian
government
has
no
particular
interest
in
the
construction
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
we
state
that
--
i
believe
that's
primarily
a
matter
for
congress
and
for
this
court
to
determine.
but
our
problem
is
this,
upon
the
record,
it
appears
that
mr.
czaplicki
was
injured
earlier
in
september
and
an
award
by
a
deputy
commissioner
was
entered
late
in
that
month.
under
the
terms
of
the
act,
he
had
30
days
from
that
period
within
which
to
sue
the
deputy
commissioner
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
award.
he
apparently
did
not,
although,
that
was
explained
to
him
by
a
letter
sent
by
the
compensation
authorities
through
him
which
is
--
was
in
evidence
before
judge
sugarman
when
we
subpoenaed
the
entire
file
in
support
of
our
motion.
then
after
that
and
the
real
nub
of
this
case
as
it's
shown
by
his
--
the
libelant's
affidavit
in
our
position
to
our
motion
on
behalf
of
kerr,
he
did
not
recover
as
quickly
as
he
thought
he
would.
he
had
accepted
compensation
believing
he
had
a
minor
injury
and
he
had
underwent
an
operation
in
august
of
1946,
which
he
attributes
to
the
injury.
meanwhile,
in
april
of
1946,
the
libelant
had
consulted
an
attorney
who
had
started
suit
in
new
jersey.
the
libelant's
affidavit,
however,
while
he
attributed
the
operation
in
this
consequent
disability
to
the
accident,
did
not
have
annexed
any
medical
certificates
or
any
doctors
affidavit,
nor
did
the
doctors
submit
his
bill
to
the
compensation
people
the
way
he
was
authorized
to
do.
and
under
the
act,
the
libelant,
with
his
attorney,
had
one
year
from
the
final
payment
of
compensation
or
well,
oh
--
after
this
time
of
the
operation
to
reopen
this
compensation
case.
had
he
done
that?
then
if
he
decided
finally
not
to
take
compensation
or
suit,
he
could
have
opposed
the
issuance
of
an
award
of
the
--
or
if
the
award
was
modified
within
a
year,
he
could
then
sue
within
30
days
claiming
the
conflict
of
interest.
our
position
on
the
conflict
of
interest
is
that
there
is
no
proof
or
fraud
in
this
record.
that
question
came
up
three
times,
came
up
before
judge
goddard
in
the
hamilton
motion.
it
came
up
before
judge
ryan
in
both
cases
at
the
trial.
libelant's
counsel
said
he
did
not
wish
to
allege
and
not
--
did
not
wish
to
attempt
to
prove
fraud.
and
that
statement
is
also
included
in
the
court
of
appeals
introduction
on
the
facts.
we,
and
the
norwegian
government,
would
not
definitely
not
be
interested
in
being
involved
in
any
sort
of
a
fraud
proceeding.
we
did
look
into
the
matter
as
best
that
we
could
check
the
record
and
there
is
no
proof
whatsoever
in
the
record
or
in
all
the
papers
we
could
dig
out
that
at
the
time
the
award
was
made,
and
at
the
time
libelant
was
discussing
his
case
with
the
insurance
company
that
anybody
in
the
new
york
office
of
the
insurance
company
knew
of
any
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well
it
would
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
if
you
are
advising
a
man
on
his
rights
who
doesn't
have
counsel
and
you
don't
tell
the
man
something
which
you
know
that
indicates
that
you
have
some
other
interest
besides
the
compensation
that
you
would
then
might
well
have
a
question
of
fraud.
i
don't
think
an
insurance
company
man,
with
his
knowledge
of
the
law,
with
his
knowledge
of
the
claims
could
conscientiously
tell
the
man
your
question
here
is
to
take
compensation
and
whether
--
and
your
--
either
take
compensation
under
an
award
or
sue
if
he
knew
at
the
time
he
said
that.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
your
honor
on
that
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
on
that
point,
the
royal
norwegian
government
had
its
situation
arise
involving
a
compensation
act
passed
in
1927
with
no
provision
for
conflict
of
interest
in
connection
with
the
assignment
of
third
party
rights.
in
1929,
the
case
came
up
for
the
first
time
in
hunt
against
bank
line
which
it
was
decided
that
even
though
there
is
a
conflict
of
interests,
the
employer
and
his
underwriter
had
no
obligation
to
bring
suit.
the
act
was
then
amended
and
especially
section
33,
providing
for
assignments,
was
amended
in
1938.
yet
this
decision
of
hunt
and
bank
line,
another
decision
stemming
from
it
were
in
no
way
taken
into
account
in
the
amendment.
the
amendments
of
1938,
provided
only
that
the
injured
man,
instead
of
assigning
his
rights
upon
the
acceptance
of
compensation,
did
not
assign
any
rights
and
the
employer
did
not
have
any
right
to
bring
a
suit
until
an
award
had
been
entered.
they
made
the
award
the
criteria.
they
didn't
make
absence
of
conflict
to
enter
strict
criterion.
now,
as
i
gathered
from
mr.
chazen's
argument,
he
is
seeking
to
have
this
court
amend
the
statute
by
judicial
process
to
make
conflict
of
interest,
another
criteria
in
the
assignment
of
rights
of
the
person
injured
from
his
title
to
compensation.
it's
a
little
difficult
for
the
royal
norwegian
government
to
see
how
it
--
an
act
could
be
amended
nunc
pro
tunc
to
go
back
to
1945.
we
state
the
matter
should
be
decided
by
congress.
and,
in
fact,
the
bill
has
been
introduced
in
this
session
of
the
house
to
cover
this
particular
point.
and
i've
annexed
the
copy
to
my
brief.
and
if
thus
that
bill
does
provide
that
even
under
an
award,
there
is
no
assignment,
and
the
man
does
--
does
retain
the
right
to
sue.
my
--
i
have
not
gone
in
to
any
of
the
details
or
the
difficulties
that
might
be
incumbent
on
modifying
the
plane
meaning
of
the
statute
because
we're
not
too
concerned
with
that.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
surely.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
believe,
your
honors,
subject
to
correction
that
the
record
does
show
that
if
this
petition
should
recover
judgment
against
the
hamilton
marine
company,
the
correspondent
here,
not
an
impede
respondent,
but
a
correspondent
that
then
he
--
the
hamilton
marine
would
look
to
the
travelers
insurance
company
to
pay
the
damages.
i
don't
know
the
extent
of
the
--
the
amount
of
the
policy.
i
don't
know
if
the
coverage
is
complete.
i
don't
know
he
visited
the
doctor.
but
i
do
know
there
is
a
liability
policy
as
shown
on
the
record
that
covered
both
hamilton
marine
on
their
liability
which
would
include
this
accident
and
covered
the
employer,
northern
dock
on
their
compensation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
under
my
argument,
under
the
--
i'll
say
under
the
law
and
the
statute
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
under
the
statute
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
--
and
under
the
decisions
that
have
not
been
disturbed
by
congress
in
amending
the
assignment
provision,
though
--
but
my
principal
concern
is
not
with
the
details
of
the
construction
of
the
act,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
we
follow
the
act
as
best
as
we
could
when
the
situation
arose
by
looking
at
the
act,
looking
at
the
plain
terms
thereof
and
seeing
it
hadn't
been
amended
or
changed
despite
the
bank
line
decision.
and
if
the
act
should
be
amended,
we
express
no
opinion
on
that
one
way
or
the
other,
then,
we
think
it
should
be
done
by
statute.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
your
honor.
at
least
the
large
part
depending
on
the
extent
of
their
coverage
which
doesn't
appear
on
the
record.
