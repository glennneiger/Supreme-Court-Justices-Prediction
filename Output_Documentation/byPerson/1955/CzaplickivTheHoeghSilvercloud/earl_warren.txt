on
behalf
of
his
employee
and
he
had
obtained
a
judgment
greater
than
his

he
would
have
had
to
pay
them,
wouldn't
he,
the
difference.

anything
further
to
prove
and
he
said
no.
chief

entirely
different,

it?
chief

earl
warren
mr.

isn't
it
that
something
--
isn't
that
something
mr.

that
the

court
should
find
on?
chief

earl
warren
that
that
was
the
position
of

it
had
no
adverse
interest
and
so

chief

earl
warren
why

lawyer?
chief

the

insurance
company

carried
both
the
compensation
and
the
liability
insurance
in
this
case,
you
say
it
did
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
suppose
it
had
known,
would
that
have
changed
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
court
follow
it
in
the
aetna
case
in
your
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
left
it
open.
chief
justice
earl

i
believe

two
minutes
left,
just
to

where

chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
early
was
this
--
