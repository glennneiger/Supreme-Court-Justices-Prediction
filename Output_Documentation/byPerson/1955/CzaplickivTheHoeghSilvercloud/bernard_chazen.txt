mr.
bernard
chazen
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
libelant,
who
is
the
petitioner,
on
this
appeal.
the
case
involves
an
application
of
he
assignment
provisions
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
factual
background
first,
and
then
come
to
the
legal
argument
which
turns
on
a
rather
narrow
issue,
i
think.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
these.
the
libelant
and
the
petitioner
here
is
a
longshoreman
who
was
employed
by
the
northern
dock
company
on
september
6,
1945.
while
working
on
a
vessel
in
hoboken,
new
jersey,
the
ss
hoegh
silvercloud,
he
was
injured.
this
vessel
was
owned
by
the
respondent
oivind
lorentzen,
the
director
of
shipping
of
norway
and
apparently
was
leased,
at
least
we
have
alleged
that
it
was
operated,
managed
and
controlled
by
kerr,
the
kerr
steamship
company.
and
they've
never
filed
an
answer
that
has
not
been
denied.
now,
on
this
vessel,
there
was
some
contracting
work
which
was
done
and
it
was
done
by
a
concern
known
as
the
hamilton
marine
contracting
company.
they
also
are
respondents
in
this
case.
the
accident
happened
briefly
in
this
(inaudible).
mr.
czaplicki,
while
going
on
the
vessel,
stepped
on
some
steps
which
had
been
assembled
by
carpenters
near
a
catwalk.
these
steps
were
not
secured
and
gave
way.
as
a
result,
he
fell,
he
was
injured
and
he
went
home
that
day.
he
was
treated
by
a
doctor
supplied
by
the
compensation
carrier,
the
travelers
insurance
company.
now
after
that,
the
time
sequence
becomes
important
because
i
think
it
indicates
the
point
which
i
feel
is
most
important
here.
the
employer
made
a
report
pursuant
to
the
procedure
in
the
act
on,
it
was
dated
september
6,
the
date
of
the
accident.
and
in
that
report,
substantially,
everything
which
we
have
said
was
reported
as
to
the
manner
in
which
this
injury
happened.
on
september
17th,
about
11
days
later,
a
notice
was
sent
to
the
deputy
commissioner
that
this
claim
was
going
to
be
controverted
by
the
employer.
now,
this
notice
appears
at
71
of
the
record.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
the
notice,
there
are
several
specific
grounds
listed
why
the
claim
would
be
controverted,
the
cause
of
relationship,
wages,
various
points
that
are
typically
the
basis
of
controverting
a
claim
of
this
type.
none
of
this
was
checked.
and
under
other
reasons,
the
--
the
travelers
insurance
company
or
rather
the
only
reason
the
travelers
insurance
company
stated
was
under
a
clause
stated,
called
other
reasons.
and
the
reason
they
gave
was
that
the
injured
is
undecided
whether
or
not
to
sue
a
third
party.
so
that
the
specific
purpose
of
controverting
this
claim,
11
days
after
it
happened
and
while
the
man
was
still
under
treatment
was
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
him
at
that
point
to
elect
to
take
compensation
or
to
give
up
his
right
and
give
up
his
right
against
any
possible
third
party
who
would
be
responsible.
now,
an
affidavit
has
been
filed
in
the
course
of
one
of
the
motions
by
the
libelant.
and
he
stated
that
it
went
to
the
commission,
he
asked
for
help.
he
didn't
understand
what
he
was
told.
he
was
told
that
he
would
have
to
sign
some
papers
if
he
wanted
to
get
compensation
and
further
medical
treatment.
he
did.
what
he
did
sign
was
a
claim
petition,
the
claim
petition
then
enabled
the
deputy
commissioner
to
issue
an
order,
a
formal
order
called
an
award.
now,
in
that
connection
it
appears
in
the
record
from
the
travelers
insurance
company
that
this
claimant
was
60
years
of
age,
that
he
was
polish
and
he
spoke
broken
english.
and
he
got
payment
at
the
rate
of
$22.50
a
week
which
is
less
than
the
maximum
which
indicates
i
think
what
his
economic
status
was
at
that
time.
mr.
bernard
chazen
he
did
not
have
a
lawyer.
there
is
a
statement
in
the
memorandum
by
the
deputy
director
that
he
stated
he
did
not
want
a
lawyer.
i
think
in
fairness,
i
should
bring
that
out.
however,
he
did
not
have
a
lawyer
and
i
believe
that
in
many
of
these
cases,
that's
true
before
the
commission
because
the
fees
which
are
given
for
lawyers
is
not
such
that
lawyers,
as
a
general
rule,
are
eager
to
take
this
type
of
business.
so
that
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
at
that
time
and
whatever
advice
he
got,
he
got
from
the
claims
examiner
who
was
handling
this
matter
for
him.
now,
an
award
was
entered
or
what
was
catch
and
then
award
and
it
said
in
effect
that
the
man
was
totally
disabled
up
to
the
time
of
the
award.
the
award
was
dated
september
28th
and
that
he
would
get
payment
for
total
disability
up
to
that
time
and
that
payment
would
continue.
now,
that
briefly,
i
think,
states
the
facts
as
they
concern
the
award
that
was
entered
and
the
procedure
that
was
followed.
now,
the
first
point
that
i
would
like
to
go
into
legally,
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
there
was
this
award
without
going
into
its
character
as
making
it
effective
as
an
assignment.
if
there
was
an
award,
is
the
man
powerless
now
to
take
any
action
to
help
himself
as
against
the
third
party?
does,
this
award
operate
as
an
assignment
of
all
cause
of
action
under
all
circumstances
so
as
to
prevent
him
from
using
--
by
use
of
any
procedure
from
asserting
a
remedy
against
the
third
party
responsible
for
his
injury?
now,
one
other
fact
is
important
and
it
is
not
disputed.
and
that
is
that
the
hamilton
marine
contracting
company
was
subsequently
discovered
to
insure
for
liability,
to
be
insured
for
liability
by
the
same
travelers
insurance
company
that
was
the
compensation
carrier
paid
the
award
and
took
unto
itself
the
cause
of
action.
now,
there's
nothing
in
this
record,
there
is
no
statement
by
them
that
they
ever
advised
the
man,
at
anytime,
that
they
had
an
inconsistent
position.
that
they
forced
the
man
by
the
procedure,
which
they
followed
to
take
an
award.
there
is
some
statement
by
the
deputy
commissioner
and
by
the
claims
examiner
that
the
effect
of
the
taking
an
award
was
explained
to
him.
if
it
was
explained
to
him
and
if
he
did
understand
which
he
denies,
the
effect
of
it
was
merely
to
give
the
employer
the
right
to
proceed
against
the
third
party,
to
use
his
discretion
as
to
whether
he
would
compromise
or
institute
suit
and
if
he
was
successful
in
obtaining
an
amount
of
money
in
excess
of
the
money
which
would
be
paid
on
the
comp,
mr.
czaplicki
would
be
entitled
to
it.
he
would
get
a
benefit.
certainly,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
because
the
travelers
insurance
company
here,
represented
the
contractor
that
it
certainly
would
not
dream
or
certainly
it
would
be
foolish
if
it
dreamed
of
instituting
suit
when
it
would
have
to
pay
the
eventual
bill
if
the
litigation
was
successful.
now,
this
court
recently
had
this
very
problem
suggested
to
it.
in
connection
with
the
case
of
ryan
stevedoring
versus
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
under
certain
circumstances,
a
shipowner
could
claim
indemnity
from
the
longshoreman's
employer.
and
mr.
justice
black,
in
speaking
in
the
dissent,
pointed
out
the
great
problem
which
is
created
by
this
decision
because
it
puts
the
employer
in
an
inconsistent
position.
it
puts
the
employer
in
the
position
where
if
he
decides
to
pursue
the
third
party
responsible,
he
may
very
well
find
himself
in
the
position
where
he
will
have
to
pay
the
whole
bill.
and
rather
that
invite
that
danger,
it
would
be
easier
for
him
to
force
an
award
to
take
the
cause
of
action
and
to
kill
it.
in
the
course
of
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
he
states
that
it
was
suggested
to
the
--
to
the
court
that
the
courts
would
protect
employees
under
the
circumstances
which
he
discussed
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
now,
the
problem
there
is
similar
to
the
problem
here.
only
here,
the
problem
is
much
more
aggravated
and
clear.
here
it
isn't
the
possibility
the
travelers
might
wind
up
paying
the
full
tariff.
here
travelers
from
the
very
beginning
must
have
known
that
any
successful
suit
against
the
third
party
would
wind
up
with
travelers
paying
the
bill.
i
might
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
be
the
carpenters
who
failed
to
secure
a
catwalk
or
a
stairway,
that
even
if
the
shipowner
were
responsible
under
unseaworthiness,
there
certainly
would
be
a
--
a
good
claim
by
the
shipowner
over
as
against
hamilton
marine.
now,
the
court
below,
if
i
may,
i
want
to
revert
now,
to
the
history
of
this
litigation.
the
libelant
instituted
suit
against
the
vessel,
against
hamilton
marine,
against
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
against
the
manager
of
the
vessel,
the
managing
agent
or
the
lessee.
the
--
one
of
the
respondents
moved
before
judge
sugarman
on
exceptions
to
have
the
libel
dismissed
as
to
wit,
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
an
effective
award
under
the
provisions
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
and
that
this
effective
award
made
the
libelant
an
improper
party
to
bring
suit.
they
also
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
libelant
was
guilty
of
laches.
so
that
there
were
two
grounds
before
judge
sugarman
on
that
motion
or
exception.
judge
sugarman
said,
“i
find
that
there
was
an
effective
assignment.
therefore,
it
is
dismissed
because
the
libelant
has
no
right
to
sue.”
he
specifically
stated,
“i
do
not
go
into
the
question
of
laches.”
the
libelant
then
made
a
motion
for
relief
on
several
grounds.
one
of
the
grounds
of
relief
or
request
for
relief
was
that
travelers
insurance
company
be
impleaded
and
that
they
be
forced
to
be
named
as
a
party
by
the
court.
another
ground
was
that
the
defense
be
struck
as
to
hamilton
marine
at
any
rate
because
of
the
inconsistent
position
of
travelers.
this
came
up
before
judge
goddard.
judge
goddard
stated,
that
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
actual
fraud,
he
could
not
strike
the
defense
and
denied
the
motion
to
implead
travelers
or
to
strike
the
defense.
the
case
then
came
on
for
hearing
as
to
the
parties,
remaining
parties.
they
came
on
before
judge
ryan.
and
judge
ryan,
in
view
of
what
had
happened
before,
had
a
hearing
solely
on
the
question
of
this
defense.
and
he
stated
that
in
view
of
the
decision
of
his
--
decisions
of
his
brother
judges,
the
law
in
this
case
had
been
settled
and
he
dismissed
the
libel.
no
judge
at
the
trial
level
went
into
the
question
of
laches.
we
then
appealed
to
the
circuit
court.
and
in
the
circuit
court,
the
decision
was
that
while
we
had
some
ground
for
seeking
to
have
a
reassignment
or
ask
the
court
for
relief
from
this
assignment.
that
we
were
guilty
of
laches.
so
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
without
any
further
hearing,
without
any
further
evidence
and
without
the
issue
having
been
passed
upon
at
the
trial
court
level,
decided
the
case
on
the
issue
of
laches.
now,
our
reasons
for
saying
that
we
are
entitled
or
we
should
get
relief
from
the
court
are
basically
these.
first
of
all,
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
liberal
branch
of
the
law.
admiralty
applies
equitable
principles.
admiralty
applies
broad
equity.
i
have
cited
some
cases
to
that
effect.
i
don't
think
that
anybody
disputes
it.
secondly,
the
longshoremen
and
harbor-workers'
compensation
act,
as
a
matter
of
construction,
is
to
be
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
the
injured
workmen.
any
result
of
that
act,
any
construction
of
the
act,
which
is
harsh,
which
is
incongruus,
which
shocks
the
court
is
not
to
be
followed.
it's
to
be
given
a
liberal
construction
in
favor
of
the
injured
workmen.
now,
there's
nothing
in
this
act
which
compels
the
conclusion
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this
one,
the
injured
workmen
cannot
have
proper
protection
from
the
court.
now,
let
us
analyze
the
act
as
an
overall
unit
and
see
what
the
act
does.
the
act
says,
first
of
all,
the
injured
workman
is
entitled
to
compensation.
he's
entitled
to
medical
treatment.
it
says
specifically
in
one
section
that
even
without
an
award
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
employer
or
his
insurer
to
immediately,
promptly
give
what
the
man
is
entitled
to
under
the
act.
secondly,
the
access,
if
the
man
wants
to
he
can
file
a
notice
of
election.
he
can
elect
to
sue.
now,
does
that
mean
that
he
has
an
election
in
the
final
sense,
in
the
sense
that
he
takes
one
or
the
other?
the
act
doesn't
say
that.
the
act
says
that
when
he
filed
a
notice
of
election
to
sue,
all
that
he
is
doing
is
setting
up
the
priority
of
this
claims
because
if
he
sues
a
third
party
and
he
loses,
he
can
come
back
in
compensation
regardless
of
any
statute
of
limitations.
he
can
come
back
in
compensation
and
he
can
demand
everything
that
he
would
--
have
been
entitled
to
under
the
compensation
act.
the
same
thing
is
true
if
in
the
third
party
action
he
gets
an
award,
which
is
substantially
less
than
the
benefits
he
would
be
entitled
to
under
the
compensation
act.
so
that
the
act
does
not
require
a
sacrifice
of
the
man's
cause
of
action
against
the
third
party.
all
that
the
act
does
is
provide
that
he
elect
as
to
a
priority
under
certain
circumstances.
now,
the
act
also
provides
that
if
the
employer
has
the
cause
of
action
and
he
sues
a
third
party,
he
is
only
entitled
to
the
--
his
compensation
win,
so
to
speak.
and
the
balance
is
supposed
to
go
to
the
injured
employee.
by
construction,
in
addition,
if
there
has
been
no
award,
and
the
employer
has
paid
certain
benefits
informally
as
many
of
them
do,
the
--
the
courts
have
recognized
that
the
employer
has
a
lien
against
any
recovery
which
the
longshoreman
may
have
regardless
of
whether
or
not,
there
was
any
award
made
in
the
case.
now
if
this
is
all
that
the
act
intends,
if
this
is
the
arrangement,
the
scheme
of
the
act
there
certainly
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
the
court
in
this
type
of
the
situation
from
bringing
in
all
the
parties
and
protecting
the
parties
according
to
their
interest.
certainly,
the
employer
will
get
back
whatever
money
he
has
laid
out.
certainly,
he
is
not
damaged
in
anyway.
and
certainly,
the
injured
employee
is
given
the
benefit
of
his
third
party
cause
of
action.
i
do
not
think
that
congress
could
have
intended
to
permit
or
to
give
the
insurance
companies,
in
this
type
of
the
situation,
a
cheap
way
to
buy
themselves
out
of
third
party
litigation.
that's
what
this
amounts
to.
now,
in
my
position
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
the
employer
himself
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
only
if
the
employer
himself
indemnified
the
third
party.
in
this
particular
case,
if
we're
talking
about
travelers,
travelers
would
be
liable
if
they
carry
the
full
coverage
on
the
third
party
responsible.
mr.
bernard
chazen
so
that
obviously,
they
have
a
basically
inconsistent
position.
now,
one
of
the
points
i
think
that's
going
to
be
raised
here,
and
i
might
as
well
meet
it
now,
is
that
the
act
gives
to
the
insurance
company
the
right
to
compromise,
to
do
what
they
want
with
this
cause
of
action
which
they
have.
and
i
say
that
as
long
as
they
act
in
good
faith
that
is,
so.
and
i
think
that
congress
presumed
that
they
would
act
in
good
faith,
normally,
because
they
would
have
an
interest
to
do
so.
and
congress
didn't
want
to
have
a
lot
of
questions
raised
about
whether
they
exercised
their
discretion
properly
when
they
settled
the
claim.
but
where
you
get
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
from
the
very
beginning
the
--
the
insurance
company
has
a
position
antagonistic
to
the
employee,
then
using
the
general
broad
equity
power
of
the
court,
the
court
should
intervene
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
employee
and
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
insurance
company.
now,
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
don't
believe
it
would.
the
--
the
new
york
statute
of
limitation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
--
i
don't
believe,
so.
i
believe
that
the
new
york
statute
limitations
has
equitable
actions
would
govern
and
i
believe
that
is
a
--
well,
that's
a
10
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
--
10-year
statute
that
might
have
run.
as
this
was
in
1945,
it
would
depend
on
the
date
of
the
breach
of
trust.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
the
--
the
remark
--
the
question
was
directed
to
a
separate
suit
for
breach
of
trust,
which
will
not
be
an
admiralty
proceeding.
that
would
be
an
equitable
proceeding,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
chazen
we
would
have
to
go
in
on
diversity.
we
would
have
to
sue
in
a
straight
equitable
action
as
i
see
it,
although,
possibly,
this
might
be
considered
maritime
in
character
because
of
the
background.
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
--
to
get
into
that
argument.
i
haven't
--
i'm
not
fully
familiar
with
the
law
on
it.
now,
judge
hand
has
stated
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
it
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes,
your
honor,
there's
no
question.
mr.
bernard
chazen
insofar
as
--
as
this
is
concerned
and
i
think
i
see
now
what
your
honor
is
talking
about.
in
the
second
circuit,
and
i
think
some
of
the
other
circuits
have
--
have
followed
it,
they
have
developed
a
very
strong
rule
concerning
analogous
statutes
of
limitations.
and
sometimes
you
get
rather
involved
by
looking
to
new
jersey
and
then
referring
back
to
new
york,
you'll
get
into
the
complex
of
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
there
--
there
is
--
there
is
no
problem
at
this
point
we
say,
because
we
have
never
fully
litigated
that
issue.
mr.
bernard
chazen
and
there
was
no
such
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
except
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
--
in
--
well,
except
that
we
have
this
situation,
your
honor.
that
insofar
as
we
are
asking
for
equitable
relief
in
this
case,
then
i
think
the
new
york
equity
statute
of
limitations
or
the
way
it
has
been
construed
which
would
be
their
longest
statute
of
limitations
would
be
10
years.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
--
i
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
then
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
statute
would
controlling
here.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
--
i
(inaudible)
now,
to
come
back
just
once
more
to
this
point
of
the
assignee
and
the
trust
relationship,
judge
learned
hand
has
said
in
--
in
one
opinion
that
the
insurance
company,
when
they
get
this
cause
of
action,
become
an
assignee.
and
at
page
17
of
my
brief,
and
i
think
this
is
important
from
my
view
from
my
argument,
i
quote
from
judge
learned
hand's
opinion.
and
in
the
italicized
portion
of
his
opinion,
he
says,
"the
assignee
holds
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
employee
so
far
as
it
is
not
necessary
for
his
own
recoupment.
the
assignee
is
in
effect
a
trustee,
and,
although
it
is
true
that
the
statute
gives
him
power
to
compromise
the
whole
claim,
he
must
not,
in
doing
so,
entirely
disregard
the
employee's
interest."
now,
in
the
opinion
of
judge
frank,
in
the
circuit
court
in
this
case,
judge
frank
quoted
from
judge
learned
hand's
opinion
and
said,
"the
contention
may
be
said
to
have
particular
course
where
as
in
the
instant
case,
the
assignee
is
not
in
the
ordinary
position
of
adverse
interest
to
the
third
party
but
is
an
insurer
who
has
a
common
interest
with
the
third
party
because
he
has
also
insured
that
party.
so
that
based
on
that
language
by
these
two
judges,
we
feel
that
a
trustee
relationship
is
created
here.
and
that
because
of
that
trustee
relationship
and
because
of
the
equitable
--
equitable
approach
of
this
court,
that
the
district
court
should
have
impleaded
travelers
or
should
have
worked
out
some
procedure
whereby
the
interest
of
all
the
third
parties
would
have
been
protected
and
none
would
have
been
harmed.
mr.
bernard
chazen
no,
i
--
i
think
that
both
judge
frank's
statement
and
judge
learned
hand's
statements
are
dicta
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
no.
judge
frank
said
there
was
an
adverse
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
the
--
the
contention
of
the
trustee
relationship
is
that
this
contention
may
be
said
to
have
particular
force
where
as
in
the
instant
case,
the
assignee
is
not
in
the
ordinary
position
of
adverse
interest
to
the
third
party,
but
is
an
insurer
who
has
a
common
interest
with
the
third
party.
mr.
bernard
chazen
oh,
yes.
well,
let
me
say
this.
that
the
reason
they
have
an
adverse
interest
is
different
than
the
reason
in
the
ryan
case.
that
reason
that
the
--
the
insurer
has
an
adverse
interest
here
is
because
he
is
the
liability
insurer
for
the
third
party.
mr.
bernard
chazen
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
chazen
before
--
before
the
recess,
the
question
was
asked
as
to
the
relationship
of
judge
frank's
opinion,
a
quotation,
and
the
ryan
stevedoring
case.
now,
i
--
i
hope
i'm
not
confusing
my
own
argument
when
i
speak
of
these
two
cases.
they
are
analogous
but
the
situation
is
different
factually
in
each.
in
the
ryan
case,
your
problem
arises
because
of
the
alleged
indemnity
or
because
of
an
alleged
indemnity
by
the
shipowner
against
the
employer.
so
that
even
if
the
employer
does
not
insure
the
shipowner
for
liability,
he
has
an
interest
which
will
be
adverse
to
his
own
employee
and
if
he
gets
an
award
or
his
insurer
gets
an
award
and
pays
compensation,
they
are
put
in
a
position
that
if
they
sue
the
shipowner,
the
shipowner
may
turn
around
and
say,
“well,
we
want
you
to
pay
for
this
on
the
theory
of
indemnity."
and
that's
regardless
of
whether
they
actually
are
the
liability
insurers
for
the
shipowner.
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
problem
that
you
have
in
the
ryan
case,
but
the
effect
is
the
same
of
anything
that
is
stronger.
because
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
insurance
carrier
for
the
employer
of
the
compensation
carrier
of
travelers
here,
also,
is
the
liability
insurer
for
the
third
party
and
it
is
in
that
situation
where
there
is
this
conflict
of
interest
that
we
say
that
the
--
the
insurance
carrier
cannot
fulfill
an
obligation
as
a
trustee
that
--
that
the
--
the
act
creates
a
species
of
trustee
relationship
between
the
employer
or
the
insurance
carrier
and
the
injured
employee
and
that
congress
has
entrusted
to
the
employer
in
that
situation
the
duty
to
go
ahead,
if
against
the
third
party.
but
where
you
have
this
type
of
situation
where
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest,
then
traditionally,
the
courts
have
interfered.
the
courts
have,
under
equitable
principles,
made
whatever
arrangements
when
necessary
to
protect
the
interests
of
all
the
parties.
because,
obviously,
the
insurance
company,
having
an
adverse
interest
with
relation
to
the
cause
of
action
of
the
third
party
is
not
in
a
position
in
good
faith
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute
that
cause
of
action
against
the
third
party.
now,
there
is
a
case,
which
the
court
cited
below,
which
is
the
case
of
hunt
versus
bank
line.
i
think
i
have
to
mention
that
case
in
passing
because
that
case
is
directly
in
point
in
this
issue.
and
that
case
is
held
in
an
identical
situation
that
the
employer
or
that
his
insurance
carrier
can't
take
the
cause
of
action
even
though
he
has
this
inconsistent
position
and
the
employer
--
and
the
employee
can't
do
anything
about
it.
and
that's
hunt
versus
bank
line,
its
35
f.2d,
136
and
it's
a
1929
case.
now
in
my
brief,
i
had
given
the
reasons
why
i
think
that
this
case
is
not
sound
law.
first
of
all,
the
reasoning
of
the
case
is
in
conflict
with
the
reasoning
of
judge
learned
hand
and
judge
frank
insofar
as
they
find
that
the
act
creates
a
trustee
relationship.
in
the
hunt
case,
that
trustee
relationship
is
specifically
rejected.
secondly,
the
hunt
case
came
before
the
assignment
provision
of
--
of
section
933
was
amended.
at
the
time
of
the
hunt
case,
if
the
employee
took
any
kind
of
benefit,
whatsoever,
even
if
he
got
medical
benefits,
without
an
award,
without
any
formal
action,
that
automatically
operated
to
assign
his
cause
of
action
to
the
employer.
now,
since
that
time,
the
act
has
been
amended
but
it
was
in
1938.
and
now,
the
act
requires
that
in
order
for
an
assignment
to
be
affected,
there
must
be
an
award
by
a
deputy
commissioner.
now,
normally,
i
should
explain,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
much
of
the
workers
handled
by
claims
examiners
and
any
order
which
has
entered
by
claims
examiner
is
not
such
an
award
as
would
cause
a
transfer
of
the
cause
of
action.
so
that
when
the
act
was
amended,
congress
showed
that
it
did
not
intend
to
make
the
rights
of
the
employee
exclusive,
one
or
the
other,
because
it
is
quite
possible
and
it
happens
quite
often
that
the
employee
will
be
paid
on
an
informal
basis.
and
as
long
as
he
is
paid
on
an
informal
basis,
there
is
no
assignment
he
can,
at
anytime,
file
a
notice
of
election
to
sue
preserve
his
rights
for
the
balance
of
his
compensation
and
can
sue
the
third
party.
even
if
he
is
successful
in
the
third
party
action,
the
employer
has
a
lien
for
the
money
that
he's
paid
out.
if
he's
unsuccessful,
the
employee
can
always
come
back
and
ask
for
more.
so
that
the
assumption
that's
in
the
hunt
case,
that
these
two
remedies
are
exclusive,
i
think
the
court
referred
to
it
as
choosing
between
joint
tortfeasor
as
the
spoken
in
those
terms.
it's
not
analogous.
congress
did
not
intend
to
have
that
type
of
situation.
the
--
the
relationship
which
arises
in
the
employer-employee
relationship
is
a
contractual
one
and
it's
not
analogous
to
a
choice
between
two
joint
tortfeasors.
the
only
thing
that
congress
intended
from
a
plain
reading
of
the
statue
to
give
the
employer
was
the
right
to
proceed
on
his
own,
to
collect
fact
the
money
that
he
has
paid.
i
think
that
is
all
it
that
can
be
fairly
read
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
--
from
the
act
itself.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well
if
--
may
--
may
i
just
to
clarify,
are
we
referring
to
this
type
of
situation
or
where
there
is
no
question
of
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
well
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
as
i
understand
the
cases
that
we've
had
up
to
now
and
i,
often,
i
can't
recall
any
case
decided
by
this
court,
but
that
--
certainly,
the
circuit
courts
have
held
that
so
far
as
there
is
no
conflict
of
interest,
the
employer
or
the
insurance
carrier
has
absolute
discretion.
there
is
some
language
in
the
cases
that
if
there
was
some
fraud
shown
in
connection
with
it
that
the
court
might
then
intervene.
but
as
along
as
it
--
it's
completely
discretionary,
he
can
sue,
he
can
refuse
to
sue,
he
can
do
whatever
he
wishes.
that's
left
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
employer
and
that
had
--
that
i
think
is
the
gist
of
the
decisions
which
i've
read
up
to
now.
so
that
in
that
type
of
situation
under
the
act,
i
would
say,
that
congress
has
made
a
choice.
congress
has
said,
in
most
situations,
that
the
employer
may
use
his
discretion.
now,
and
they
--
they
haven't
indicated
that
there
would
be
an
--
any
interference
with
it
but
when
the
conflict
of
interest
comes
in,
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
permit
the
employer
to
use
this
device
to
avoid
liability
on
the
other
end.
i
think
that
congress,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
discretion,
decided
that
the
employer
would
have
enough
interest
in
recoupment
to
act
in
good
faith
for
himself
and
the
injured
employee.
mr.
bernard
chazen
this
case
was
disposed
of
on
the
pleadings
except
that
at
the
final
hearing,
before
judge
ryan,
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
full
hearing,
he
limited
the
issue
solely
to
the
question
of
whether
this
assignment
was
an
effective
defense
because
it
was
brought
to
his
attention
the
two
judges
have
already
ruled
on
the
question
and
he
felt,
apparently,
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
have
a
full
trial
since
that
issue
seemed
to
be
determined
at
least
so
far
as
the
trial
court
level
was
concerned.
now,
i
think
that,
also,
i
would
--
should
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
hunt
case
was
left
up
in
the
air
by
a
subsequent
decision
of
this
court.
in
the
case
of
aetna
life
insurance
company
versus
moses
which
was
at
1933,
there
was
a
question
about
whether
or
not
the
carrier
could
join
the
administratrix
of
an
injured
employee
of
his
estate
in
a
suit
against
the
third
party
and
the
court
said
it
could.
now,
in
the
opinion
by
chief
justice
stone,
one
of
the
remarks
that
was
made
was,
nor
do
we
consider
what
would
be
the
rights
of
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
or
the
personal
representative
compare
hunt
versus
bank
line
or
the
insurer
in
a
case
where
the
employer
refused
to
cooperate
in
the
prosecution
of
the
action.
so
that,
so
far
as
i
can
find,
and
as
i
read
the
cases,
in
the
last
opinion
of
this
court
on
the
subject,
the
question
was
left
open
and
hunt
line
versus
--
hunt
versus
bank
line
was
left
up
in
the
air
neither
approved
or
disapproved.
so
that,
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
the
question
is
still
an
open
one.
now,
there's
one
other
point
that
i'd
like
to
take
up
and
that
is
the
question
of
what
is
an
award.
in
1938,
the
act
was
amended
to
provide
that
you
--
that
it
was
required
that
there
be
an
award
by
a
deputy
commissioner.
now,
any
--
the
--
the
cases
have
said,
any
informal
memorandum
by
claims
examiner
or
etcetera
is
not
such
an
award
as
to
operate
as
an
assignment.
now,
in
this
case,
the
intent
apparently
was
to
enter
an
award.
we
can
gather
that
from
the
proceedings
that
went
on.
the
employee
wanted
to
force
the
man
to
take
whatever
money
he
was
entitled
to
under
an
award.
now,
the
argument
that
i've
made
up
to
now
has
been
based
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
an
award
and
that
the
court,
under
its
acquittal
powers,
would
interfere
to
protect
the
man
even
though
there
was
an
award.
i
now
come
to
the
question,
was
there
an
award
within
the
meaning
of
this
assignment
provision?
now,
the
only
proceeding
that
i
can
find,
which
is
described
in
the
act,
which
terminates
in
an
award,
is
contained
in
section
919.
and
there
is
a
--
a
--
a
whole
procedure
set
forth
and
there's
only
one
part
of
the
procedure
set
forth
that
was
not
complied
with
here.
and
the
question
is,
isn't
the
award
which
would
be
effective,
the
--
only
the
award
that
would
be
made
pursuant
to
this
particular
section,
and
i
think
it
would,
and
is
the
defect
of
such
quality
as
to
vitiate
or
negated
this
award
being
such
an
award
as
to
operate
as
an
assignment.
now,
the
commissioner,
the
provisions
here
are
for
the
commissioner
to
give
notice
to
the
employer
of
the
claim
being
made,
etcetera.
and
then,
in
paragraph
c,
the
last
sentence,
after
it
says
that
the
commissioner
can
order
a
hearing,
he
says,"
if
no
hearing
is
ordered
within
20
days
after
notice
has
given,
as
provided
in
subdivision
(b),
the
deputy
commissioner
shall,
by
order,
reject
the
claim
or
make
an
award."
now,
the
award
was
entered
the
same
day.
there
was
no
time
for
hearing.
now
if
the
purpose
or
one
of
the
purposes
for
the
amendment
requiring
an
award
as
to
give
the
man
a
chance
to
think,
then,
this
becomes
an
important
provision
for
the
purpose
of
assignment.
if
that
is
just
a
directory
provision,
then,
of
course,
it's
immaterial
and
the
award
is
good.
now,
respondents
in
their
briefs
have
raised
the
question
that
we
are
making
the
collateral
attack
on
the
determination
of
the
deputy
commissioner.
we're
not
making
a
--
a
collateral
attack.
so
far
as
his
order
is
concerned,
and
insofar
as
it
purports
to
do
what
it
did,
it
was
valid.
we
--
we
don't
question.
the
--
the
only
question
we
raise
is,
is
it
such
an
award
as
operates
to
make
an
assignment.
that
would
have
to
be
determined
in
the
lower
court
or
in
the
court
of
admiralty
because
they
are
now
raising
the
question
of
assignment
as
a
matter
of
defense.
and
we
are
saying
that
there
was
no
such
award
as
to
operate
as
an
assignment
so
that
the
question
now
must
be
determined
on
the
admiralty
side,
on
the
legal
side.
and
there's
no
basis
for
us,
there
was
no
basis
for
us
to
go
back
and
to
attempt
to
have
the
wording
change
on
the
order.
the
question
of
characterizing
this
document
is
something
that
should
--
that
has
to
be
determined
on
this
side
of
defense,
not
on
that.
so,
we
feel
that
we
are
not
making
any
collateral
attack
on
this
order
or
award.
on
the
question
of
--
of
laches,
i
think
i
could
limit
my
argument
basically
to
this
one
point.
this
court
has
said,
again,
and
again,
and
again
that
the
question
of
laches
is
a
question
for
the
trial
court
after
all
the
facts
are
entered.
the
trial
court
deliberately
here
did
not
pass
on
the
question.
the
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
it
was
pleaded,
yes,
your
honor,
and
no
question
about
it.
it
was
pleaded.
but
there
were
no
hearings
held
on
the
question
of
laches,
no
evidence
taken,
no
opportunity
given
to
a
man
if
amendment
was
deemed
advisable
or
necessary.
in
the
--
in
the
circuit
court,
the
question
of
laches
was
--
was
treated
without
any
new
findings
of
fact
--
fact
that
all
made
by
the
circuit
court
known
for
the
hearing.
we
feel
that,
under
those
circumstances,
that
question
should
be
remanded
for
hearing
and
development
in
the
normal
cause
of
trial
procedure.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes
and
i
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
they
were
reviewed
but
the
court
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
they
--
they
were
not
adjudicated,
judge
frank,
specifically,
after
indicating
that
he
thought
we
were
right
on
the
question
of
the
trustee
relationship
theory,
said
but
we
don't
have
to
go
into
that
question.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
--
i
think
that
the
only
issues
are
those
the
question
of
the
trusteeship
theory
and
--
and
the
question
of
laches
because
actually
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
as
i
read
the
judge
frank's
opinion,
i
think
he
agreed
with
us.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
no,
your
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
don't
think
so,
unless
it
is
the
question
of
procedure
and
i
think
that
the
rules
of
the
federal
courts
and
of
admiralty
are
so
broad
that
certainly
the
procedure
for
bringing
in
travelers
or
for
working
out
the
problem
could
be
worked
out
within
the
framework
of
the
--
of
existing
decisions
and
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
no
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
chazen
there
is
no
hard
and
fast
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
no
your
honor,
i
--
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
with
that
i've
--
i've
exhausted
the
points
that
i
feel
are
important.
i
--
i
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
if
--
if
you
--
if
this
court
finds,
and
i
think
it
would
be
making
a
new
doctrine
if
it
did
or
something
which
it
has
never
done
before,
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
was
laches
in
this
case
at
his
point
with
--
with
the
record
in
the
state
of
this
at
the
present
time.
then,
of
course,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
and
the
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
then
it
should
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
the
determination
of
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
--
i
don't
--
well,
let
me
say
this.
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
court
to
decide.
i
think
it
would
be
most
expeditious
for
the
court
to
decide
both
issues
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
--
and
have
the
matter
go
back
to
the
district
court
if
that's
the
end
result
and
let
the
district
court
develop
the
case
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
the
court.
i
--
i
don't
see
that
any
purpose
would
be
served
by
sending
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
perhaps
having
to
come
up
here
again.
mr.
bernard
chazen
there
wouldn't
be
any
point.
on
--
on
either
ground,
if
--
if
we
lose
on
either
ground,
as
i
see
it,
we're
out.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
--
i
think
i've
concluded
my
argument.
i
just
would
like
to
say
briefly
as
my
final
argument
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
court
of
admiralty
should
use
its
broad
equitable
powers
and
this
is
a
situation
where
the
liberal
intent
for
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
should
be
put
in
effect.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
of
the
facts.
first
of
all,
they
must
--
counsel
asked
the
court
to
assume
a
great
deal
about
the
lack
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
travelers.
we
attempted
to
take
the
deposition
of
the
travelers
insurance
company
and
we
did
under
a
very
limited
order
by
judge
dimock
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
record
at
page
73
where
there
were
three
documents
which
we
were
able
to
fill
out
of
that
file.
now,
i
don't
think
that
from
that
deposition,
it
can
be
assumed
that
the
whole
story
appears
in
the
record.
the
second
thing
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
is
that
in
one
of
their
reports,
they
do
mention
the
hamilton
marine
company.
they
did
know
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
that
the
hamilton
marine
contracting
company
was
the
third
party
defendant.
at
page
80,
reading
from
the
first
notice
of
accident
form,
the
very
last
line
reading,
an
outside
contractor,
hamilton
marine
contracting
company,
so
they
knew
from
the
very
beginning
it
was
the
hamilton
marine.
mr.
bernard
chazen
record
at
page
80
it's
in
this
--
it's
the
section
that
was
added.
mr.
bernard
chazen
the
very
last
line.
mr.
bernard
chazen
this
one?
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
believe
--
i
believe
that
so,
otherwise,
i've
been
--
i
have
just
read
this
case
all
the
way
through
from
the
trial
court.
i've
always
assumed
that
--
that
was
so
i
--
i
can't
recall
where
--
where
was
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
that
--
that
the
insurance
carrier
in
the
hunt
case
had
an
--
had
an
adverse
interest
to
the
employee
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
i
--
i
believe
it's
somewhere
in
the
opinion
there.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i've
always
assume,
that
was
one
of
my
hurdles,
your
honor.
i'd
be
very
happy
to
hear
i
misread
the
case.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
--
i
believe
it
--
it's
in
there.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
believe
in
the
body
of
the
opinion,
the
court
somewhere
averts
this
fact
that
he
raised
the
question
that
the
employer
or
the
insurance
carrier
also
was
responsible
for
the
third
party
negligence.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
think
that's
in
the
body
of
the
opinion,
your
honor,
because
i
--
that's
one
of
the
contentions
that's
in
there.
now
i'd
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
believe
that
less
counsel
indicated
that
travelers
did
not
know
in
the
beginning
that
hamilton
marine
was
one
of
the
--
was
the
third
party
responsible
here.
now,
here
in
this
testimony,
which
is
taken
from
one
of
--
from
their
file,
from
an
accident
report
in
their
file,
the
first
accident
report,
we
see
that
from
the
very
beginning,
they
did
know
that
on
this
one
document,
there
is
a
statement
that
the
hamilton
marine
contracting
company
was
involved
in
this
accident.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
there
--
there
is
no
date
on
--
and
unfortunately,
here,
there
is
no
statement
of
it,
but
since
it
was
the
first
notice
of
accident
form,
it
would
be
--
certainly,
it
would
--
the
very
first
papers
they
have
on
the
file.
and
the
prior
papers
are
dated
september
17th.
now,
i'd
also
quote
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes,
yes
sir.
that's
where
the
adverse
interest
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
both,
that
--
that's
precisely
the
point.
they
--
they
insured
for
liability,
the
hamilton
marine
contracting
company.
they
also
insured
for
compensation,
the
northern
dock
company
who
was
this
man's
employer,
so
that
they
were
in
--
on
both
sides
of
the
defense.
if
they
sue
the
hamilton
marine
and
obtained
the
recovery,
they'd
be
taking
their
money
out
of
one
pocket
putting
in
the
other
and
giving
the
difference
to
the
--
to
the
injured
man.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
think
mr.
phelan
assumes
more
regiments
on
there
but
--
then,
perhaps
it
justified.
i
do
note
that
there
was
great
haste
in
insisting
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
that
there'd
be
a
formal
award
entered.
there
was
no
necessity
for
it.
mr.
bernard
chazen
i
cannot
fully
state
why
because,
frankly,
i
was
not
in
the
office
at
the
time
and
i
can't
give
it
from
my
personal
knowledge.
i
think
there
were
negotiations
during
this
period.
there
were
statements,
demands
were
made
and
i
meant
before
my
time
was
up
to
show
that
they
filed
an
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
bernard
chazen
that
there
were
negotiations
that
went
on
after
we
got
in
the
case.
now,
just
exactly
when
and
how,
i
don't
know,
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
i
think
that
the
reason
for
this
delay
to
be
perfectly
frank
was
the
problem
that
we
face
in
the
office
and
working
out
the
procedure
for
going
ahead
with
this
thing
in
view
of
the
situation
that
had
been
created.
demands
were
made.
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
discussions
went
on.
i
cannot
represent
to
the
court
what
happened
in
the
interim.
but
the
problem
--
we
live
with
the
problem
a
long
time
before
the
suit
had
started.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
also
to
one
other
fact
here.
there
were
some
statement
about
notice
being
given
to
traveler,
traveler
having
consented.
at
page
50
of
the
record,
there
is
an
affidavit
by
mr.
(inaudible)
who
filed
an
affidavit
on
behalf
of
the
hamilton
marine.
and
after
discussing,
making
allegations
on
behalf
of
hamilton
marine,
the
very
last
paragraph,
on
this
motion,
i
also
appear
for
the
travelers
insurance
company,
that
was
on
our
motion
to
imply
with
them.
the
travelers
insurance
company
does
not
consent
to
be
made
a
party
for
this
litigation.
now,
that's
only
specific
reference
i
can
call
the
court's
attention
to
as
to
their
refusal
to
precede.
now,
i
know
that
there
were
other
conversations
prior
thereto
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
which
i
could
call
the
court's
attention
to.
i
think
with
that,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
matters
which
i
thought
needed
correction.
thank
you.
