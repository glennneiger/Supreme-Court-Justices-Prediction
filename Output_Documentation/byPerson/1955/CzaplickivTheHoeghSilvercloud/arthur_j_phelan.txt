mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
hamilton
marine
contracting
company
and
i
suppose
also
travelers
insurance
company
so
that
it
is
conceded
in
this
case
and
was
conceded
earlier
that
the
travelers
insurance
company
did
have,
not
only
the
compensation
insurance
on
the
northern
dock
company
who
was
the
stevedore
but
they
also
had
the
liability
coverage
on
the
hamilton
marine
contracting
company.
may
i
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
may
it
please
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
at
least
--
they
would
have
to
pay,
at
least,
to
the
extent
of
the
coverage
on
the
policy
and
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
that's
all.
i
understood
and
i
don't
know
that
and
i
think
that
gets
to
justice
harlan's
original
--
one
of
his
questions
earlier
and
our
liability
there,
of
course,
would
be
limited
by
the
--
to
the
extent
of
our
coverage
under
the
policy.
my
answer
to
questions
raised
by
mr.
justice
minton,
no
demand
of
any
kind
was
ever
made
in
this
case
since
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
or
the
allegations
are
concerned
that
if
ever
the
insurance
company
or
the
northern
dock
company
institute
suit
or
proceed
in
any
way
against
the
third
party.
i
think
under
the
circumstances,
in
order
to
bring
this
case
into
its
proper
prospective
as
to
what
is
--
what
the
facts
are
and
also
what
the
allegations
are,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
run
over
the
facts
a
little
more
in
detail
as
they
are
disclosed
by
the
record.
as
indicated,
this
man
was
injured
september
6,
1945.
on
september
11,
1945,
the
travelers
insurance
company
received
from
the
employer
what
is
called
a
first
notice
of
injury,
that
is
the
employer
reports
to
the
insurance
carrier,
the
injury.
that
indicated
that
the
injuries
were
rather
tribunal
and
that
they
were
bruises,
whereupon,
the
record
shows
that
on
september
17,
1945,
this
claimant
appeared
in
the
office
of
the
traveler's
insurance
company
in
north
new
jersey.
he
lived
in
jersey
city,
made
the
trip
down
to
new
york
and
had
an
interview
with
one
of
the
investigators
of
the
travelers
insurance
company.
at
that
time,
it
developed
according
to
the
record,
i'm
reading
--
looking
at
page
78,
that
his
description
of
the
accident
was
that
he
slipped
on
some
steps,
that
he
was
going
over
to
get
in
to
the
catwalk.
the
steps
had
been
made
by
an
outside
contractor
and
were
put
in
place
by
somebody,
either
employees
of
the
outside
contractor
or
members
of
the
crew,
not
known.
the
accident
happened
sometime
between
12
o'clock
and
1'
clock
in
the
longshoremen
route
for
lunch
and
neither
the
ship,
the
s.s.
silvercloud,
nor
the
outside
contractor
are
now
as
up
here,
so
further
investigation
could
not
be
made.
i
think
that
isn't
rather
a
significant
thing.
following
that,
there
was
a
discussion
about
the
employee
or
with
the
employee.
it
was
developed
that
he
owned
his
own
home
and
he
had
a
married
daughter
who
lived
on
the
upper
floor
of
the
home.
the
employee
is
undecided
at
the
present
time
whether
to
sue
the
third
party
or
to
accept
compensation
but
his
daughter
is
very
much
in
favor
of
bringing
suit.
then,
there
was
an
unsigned
statement
attached
to
that.
the
record
then
shows
at
that
very
day,
following
that
interview,
the
same
investigator
submitted
to
the
compensation
commission
a
--
what
is
known
as
a
controversion,
controversion
on
the
ground
that
the
employee
had
not
has
yet
made
up
his
mind
on
what
he
wanted
to
do,
whether
to
sue
the
third
party
or
not,
therefore,
the
cases
controverted.
now
that
was
the
procedure
that
was
outlined
by
this
court,
not
by
any
regulations
of
the
commission
but
by
a
suggestion
of
this
court
in
the
porello
case
but
that's
the
way
you
protect
yourself,
if
you
are
an
insurance
company
and
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
third
party
claim
involved.
so
that
was
done
on
the
same
day.
there's
no
suggestion
that
this
investigator
called
up
brooklyn.
the
hamilton
company
incidentally
is
--
has
offices
in
brooklyn
where
this
is
the
new
york
office.
there's
no
suggestion
that
on
that
day,
he
called
up
hamilton
marine
to
find
out
who
hamilton's
coverage
was
and
incidentally
that's
the
first
time
that
was
ever
suggested
to
anybody
that
hamilton
marine
was
involved
in
this
case
because
that
is
the
original
notice
to
the
insurance
company,
it
didn't
mention
hamilton
marine
when
i
order.
so
that
i
submit
that
it's
unlikely
to
assume
that
an
investigator
investigating
a
(inaudible)
case
would
call
up
brooklyn
and
i
certainly
think
--
don't
think
there
was
any
duty
on
his
part
to
call
up
part
for
connecticut,
the
home
office
and
have
them
checked
their
records
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
hamilton
marine
insurance
company
also
was
covered
by
a
travelers
insurance
policy.
i
think
you've
got
to
look
at
these
things
to
some
extent
in
a
practical
way.
that
--
that's
on
september
17,
1945.
the
next
thing
that
happens,
travelers
does
nothing
else.
it
does
no
coercing.
the
next
thing
that
occurred
that
on
september
25th,
the
claims
examiner
for
the
workmen's
compensation
commission
writes
a
letter
to
the
claimant
and
said,
â€œyour
claim
has
been
controverted,
you
--
on
the
ground
that
you
don't
--
you
haven't
made
up
your
mind
as
to
what
you
want
to
do
with
respect
to
compensation."
that
letter
appears
incidentally
in
mr.
estabrook's
brief.
in
that
letter,
the
substance
of
section
33
(b)
of
the
act
is
pointed
out
in
writing
to
this
claimant.
acceptance
of
such
compensation
honored
an
award
and
the
compensation
order
filed
by
the
deputy
commissioner
shall
operate
it
as
an
assignment
to
the
employer
of
all
rights
of
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
to
recover
damages
against
such
that
person.
the
letter
goes
on,
if
on
the
other
hand,
you
elect
to
sue
the
third
party,
you
should
file
an
election
to
sue
on
the
enclosed
form
in
order
to
protect
your
future
interest
in
the
event
you
should
be
unable
to
recover
from
the
third
party,
the
amount
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
under
the
compensation
act.
that
letter
was
written
obviously
received
by
the
claimant
because
two
days
later,
on
september
27th,
he
went
to
new
york
and
visited
the
office
of
the
compensation
commission.
there
again,
according
to
the
record,
--
the
--
his
rights,
under
the
act,
were
explained
to
him
not
by
the
travelers
but
by
a
representative
of
the
compensation
commission.
at
that
time,
on
september
27th,
he
said
he
wanted
to
take
his
compensation
and
he
wasn't
interested
in
any
--
any
third
party
action
and
he
didn't
want
the
counsel,
and
therefore,
the
following
day,
on
september
28th,
an
award
was
entered.
and
you
think
it
followed
its
normal
cause
until
december
1,
the
--
that
travelers'
doctors
--
the
doctors
for
the
compensation
commission
reported
that
he
was
no
longer
injured,
no
longer
disabled,
and
was
not
entitled
to
any
further
compensation.
on
december
5,
1945,
he
is
notified
to
that
effect
and
compensation
is
stopped.
so,
insofar
as
this
record
is
concerned,
there
is
no
allegation
that
travelers
insurance
company
knew
anything
more
about
this
case
until
suit
was
filed
in
1952.
certainly,
there
was
no
obligation,
as
i
see
it,
on
the
part
of
the
travelers
insurance
company
to
find
out,
whether
or
not,
this
man
was
still
injured
following
around
the
--
the
next
year
to
determine
what
his
condition
was.
certainly,
this
court,
i
feel,
reasonably
and
certainly
is
not
going
to
rule
the
whole,
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
travelers
insurance
company
to
file
suit
any
case
involving
what
$160.72
in
workmen's
compensation
and
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case
insofar
as
the
record
shows
travelers
insurance
company
had
any
obligation.
so
that's
what
the
decision
of
travelers
found
itself
in,
when
in
1952,
the
suit
is
filed.
two,
travelers
then,
under
its
obligations
and
under
its
contract
has
to
file
and
defend
the
hamilton
marine
contractors
company.
but
up
to
that
point
i
can
see
nothing
that
travelers
could
have
or
should
have
done
with
any
reason
to
either
protect
itself,
or
to
protect
or
do
anything
for
this
injured
employee.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
under
the
statute
because
travelers
had
paid
the
compensation.
and
so
that,
that's
automatically
under
the
statute
and
certainly
the
language
in
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
assignment
for
operation
of
law
went
to
the
travelers
insurance
company.
now,
i
don't
know
that
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
next
section
given
to
the
insurance
company.
so
that's
the
position
that
--
that
travelers
was
in,
in
1946.
all
right,
what
happened
in
1946
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
what
do
i
mean?
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
should
not,
it
should
not
go
into
that
unless
and
until
the
pleadings
indicate
something.
i'm
reciting
what
this
record
discloses
if
they
had
any
information
contrary
to
that,
certainly,
it
was
their
obligation
to
plead
it
or
set
it
up
in
affidavit
form
at
the
time
they
made
a
motion.
but
i
am
giving
you
just
what
this
record
discloses
the
picture
to
be.
then
i
certainly
think
we're
within
--
100%
within
the
realm
of
facts,
it
was
--
it
wouldn't
affect
to
what
i'm
saying.
some
of
this
has
to
be
inferred
because
it's
not
pleaded,
the
other
facts
are
pleaded
or
proven
in
the
record
which
bear
out
the
story.
now
on
april
19
--
in
april
of
1946,
this
employee
got
in
the
hands
of
the
lawyer
in
new
jersey.
that's
fairly
as
far
this
record
shows
first
time
it
consulted
counsel.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
april,
1946.
in
april
of
1946,
that
attorney
filed
a
suit
in
the
state
court
of
new
jersey
against
the
kerr
steamship
company,
the
agent
for
the
vessel.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
i
think
you're
--
your
suggested
is
that
that
case
was
filed
in
april
of
19
--
in
april
1946
and
continued
on
and
was
finally
dismissed
for
lack
of
proper
service
in
november
of
1946.
the
--
in
the
meantime,
in
august
of
1946,
this
claimant
was
operated
on.
and
the
allegation
now
is
that
--
that
was
as
the
result
of
those
injuries,
but
injuries
received
in
our
accident.
but
the
record
shows
nothing
was
been
known
by
the
claimant
at
that
time,
hamilton
marine
was
not
put
on
any
notice
of
these
injuries
or
the
--
the
fact
that
these
injuries
were,
in
some
way,
connect
to
with
the
accident
or
allegedly
so,
nor
was
the
travelers
insurance
company
advised,
in
anyway,
that
this
man
was
now
asserting
that
he
was
injured
more
seriously
than
was
originally
expected.
however,
the
workmen's
compensation
act
takes
care
of
that.
if
he
had
until
december
5,
1946,
in
order
to
come
in,
and
as
for
this
compensation
award
be
reopened.
if
this
man
had
been
seriously
disabled,
his
compensation,
of
course,
would
have
continued
and
if
upon
a
proper
showing,
of
course,
where
relationship
and
if
--
as
it
is
more
--
was
hidden
in
the
record,
he
is
still
disabled.
the
compensation
would
do
continue
until
today
and
so
on
until
he
dies
assuming
that
he's
totally
and
permanently
or
totally
disabled.
so
that's
the
position
the
insurance
company
finds
itself.
until
1952,
the
only
information
it
had
was
that
there
was
a
subrogation
claimed
involving
$160.72.
certainly,
the
statute
does
not
contemplate
and
congress
never
intended
that
in
a
situation
of
that
kind,
congress
of
an
--
an
insurance
carrier
had
to
file
this
obligation
suit
or
else
forevermore
be
open
to
a
claim
of
fraud
or
constructive
fraud
or
liability
for
breach
of
trust.
now,
my
concept
of
this
case
of
the
lawyers
that
since
the
hunt
case,
which
was
in
1929,
two
years
after
the
statute
was
passed,
congress
has
had
an
opportunity
to
amend
this
statute.
the
english
language
is
quite
clear
and
this
statute's
about
as
complete,
gives
about
as
to
complete
an
assignment
as
anything
could
give.
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
it
was
a
sound
basis
for
it.
but
if
the
act
is
to
be
changed
to
cover
a
situation
such
as
this,
certainly,
there
should
be
congressional
hearings,
some
limitations
should
be
put
on
the
trust
rule
if
it
is
to
be
applied
by
congress.
certain
control
over
the
action
should
probably
give
--
be
given
to
the
workmen's
compensation
commissioner
with
respect
to
the
right
to
sue
or
the
need
to
sue.
there
are
any
number
of
ways
that
congress
could
protect
the
workmen
against
a
situation
such
as
this.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
it
did
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
it
might
well
have
changed
it
to
this
extent.
i
think
the
statute
is
clear
enough.
i
think
the
statute
gives
an
absolute
assignment
onto
any
circumstances
and
i
think
judge
harlan
had
it
--
the
very
outset
of
mr.
chazen's
argument.
i
think
the
remedy
there
for
the
employer
--
for
the
employee
would
be
some
claim
that
the
employer
or
the
insurance
carrier
or
both
were
violating
their
trust.
that
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
i
think
that
might
possibly
be
one
way
to
get
out
of
it.
i
--
i
think,
however,
that
a
better
procedure
would
have
be
--
would
be
to
proceed
separately
against
the
insurance
carrier
probably
by
way
of
an
injunction.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
he
might
not
get
all
of
--
he
might
not
get
all
the
way
up
here.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
might
not
get
all
the
way
up
here.
but
my
point
--
my
thought
on
that
is
that
if
there's
going
to
be
this
trust
relationship,
it
should
be
up
to
congress
to
establish
it
specifically
with
proper
safeguards
to
the
employer,
proper
safeguards
to
the
employee,
proper
control
by
the
commission.
you
certainly
would
open
up
on
its
nest
through
a
pandora's
box
if
the
--
by
judicial
decision,
you
say
there
is
a
trust
relationship
under
these
circumstances.
i
can
visualize
any
number
of
tremendous
problems
that
will
develop
as
a
result
of
it.
one
may
could
well
be
that
in
every
$160
case,
the
employer
immediately
goes
into
the
admiralty
court
and
files
a
suit
in
order
to
protect
themselves.
and
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
well
i'm
speaking
of
the
cases,
these
cases
where
this
dual
interest
appears.
there
are
--
there
any
number
of
thing
--
questions
that
can
be
involved.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
well
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
it
might
held
that
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
by
help
of
the
admiralty
lawyers,
and
not
then
with
the
lawyers.
they
wouldn't
help
me,
these
fellows,
i
think,
would
appreciate
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
i
--
i
didn't
catch
that.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
well
that's
just
the
question.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
congress
--
congress
hasn't
said
so,
mr.
justice
reed,
because
congress
has
said
that
the
employer
has
the
absolute
right
to
settle,
sue,
or
not
sue
as
he
sees
fit
and
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
that
it
would
have
been
in
someway
to
this
petitioner's
interest
or
some
allegation
or
fraud
or
some
allegation
have
reached
the
trust.
it's
my
position
that
he
doesn't
have
an
interest.
now
when
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
it
says
that
in
every
case
whether
--
whether
there's
the
dual
interest
or
not.
his
interest
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
every
case.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
on,
no.
it's
in
any
case
where
there's
a
third
party
and
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
i
think
it's
a
significant
thing,
if
your
honors
please,
that
this
act
has
been
in
effect
since
1927.
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
--
any
dual
interest
case
has
come
up
here
which
i
think
indicates
pretty
clearly
that
the
insurance
companies
overall
are
administering
this
act
and
their
dual
capacity
which
has
occurred
many,
many
times
in
a
pretty
fair
and
reasonable
basis.
the
--
in
order
to
change
this,
certainly,
it's
congressional,
enactment
should
be
made
after
hearings
in
order
to
determine
how
to
set
up
the
proper
machinery
to
handle
a
situation
of
this
kind.
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear.
we
go
back
to
the
hunt
case,
which
in
1929,
there,
there
was
a
dual
capacity.
the
insurance
carrier
also
had
the
liability
insurance.
there
justice
minton,
a
request
was
made.
a
demand
was
made
that
suit
be
filed
and
failing
in
the
suit
--
failure
to
file
a
suit,
the
injured
employee
undertook
to
file
a
suit
himself.
the
court
said
you
can't
do
it
because
the
assignment
is
absolute
and
that
has
been
the
law
and
that
was
the
law
that
was
followed
by
justice
--
goddard
in
this
case
by
judge
sugarman
in
this
case,
by
judge
ryan
in
this
case
and
certainly
--
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
i
don't
think
the
question
was
before
us,
this
court
in
the
aetna
case.
i
think
that
this
court
certainly
did
not
disturb
that
doctrine,
it
said
we
don't
pass
on
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
left
it
open.
i
agree.
but
that
i
think,
if
the
court
pleases,
pretty
well
summarizes
the
position
of
the
employer
and
the
insurance
carrier
and
acceptance
so
far
as
laches
is
concerned.
i
certainly
think
that
where
you
have
a
situation
where
the
man
had
a
year
in
which
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
insurance
carrier
or
the
employer
effect
that
he
wasn't
satisfied
with
the
compensation
picture.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
a
year
from
december
--
a
year
from
december.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
yes,
sir,
from
the
date
of
the
last
payment
of
compensation
here.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
nine.
mr.
arthur
j.
phelan
within
a
year
from
the
date
of
the
last
payment
of
compensation,
you
may
come
in
and
ask
that
the
--
would
be
opened
up
to
make
any
additional
claims
that
you
feel
like
making.
that
--
that
--
the
time
would
have
run
in
this
case,
so
in
this
man's
case
from
december
1945
so
that
he
had
long
after
his
operation
to
come
in
and
make
known
as
complaints
to
either
the
insurance
carrier,
the
employer
or
the
workmen's
compensation
commission.
following
that,
he
filed
a
suit
in
new
jersey
or
rather
during
that
interim
period,
he
filed
a
suit
in
new
jersey.
the
next
year,
he
filed
a
suit
in
new
york
against
the
northern
shipping
company.
and
this
record
shows
that
this
man's
case
or
he
retained
his
present
counsel
in
1948,
yet
this
suit
was
not
filed
until
1952,
june
of
1952,
about
three-and-a-half
years
after
he
retained
his
present
counsel,
that
no
explanation,
no
attempted
explanation
in
this
case
as
to
why
three-and-a-half
years
elapsed
without
the
suit
having
been
filed
that
time
or
why
no
demand
was
made
upon
travelers
or
the
employer
in
that
time
to
do
something
about
the
third
party
action.
certainly,
i
think,
it's
a
matter
of
law
and
without
any
explanation
if
mr.
justice
frank
was
right
in
holding
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed
on
the
ground
of
laches.
i
believe
that's
my
rebuttal.
