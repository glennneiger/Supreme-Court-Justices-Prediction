frankfurter
why
did
the
government
--
why
did
the
government
put
it
--
why
would
the
government
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
made
the
difference
in
--
in
this
thing?
that's
the
problem
i
come
to
discover.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
(inaudible)
managed
and
he
brought
that
of
(inaudible)
now
did
he
draw
on
that
because
and
go
to
the
statutes
could
but
he
thought
they'd
control
or
because
he
used
them
as
analogy
for
governing
the
statute.
this
city
was
amenable
to
see,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
such
problem
here
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
reason
from
judge
frank's
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
say
that
mr.
chazen,
because
whichever,
whether
--
whether
it's
a
judge
in
new
york
or
new
york
would
come
back
to
judge
you.
it's
taken
care
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
if
--
if
the
right
to
enforce
this
a
derivative
of
the
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
a
federal
law.
and
if
this
is
a
right
that
you
derive
from
as
i
gather
you
do
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
that
rule
is
in
the
federal
act
and
the
new
york
statute
is
not
controlled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
that
the
federal
court
of
equity
the
statute
for
itself
is
consonant
with
equity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
issue
the
only
one
that
the
court
refused
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
passed
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
all
beyond
those
question,
if
you
were
to
discuss,
it
was
not
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
they
were
not
--
they
were
not
adjudicated
other
than
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
assuming
--
assume
one
of
the
three
review
that
the
question
of
laches
could
not
have
been
determined
in
part
of
the
deal.
it
required
the
determination
of
the
district
court
then
we'll
try
to
abuse
as
to
what
and
assume
we
agreed
with
you
if
you
understand.
i
would
like
to
have
your
view
but
other
issues
should
be
adjudicated
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
doesn't
that
judge
frank
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reject
the
trusteeship
theory,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
that
that
is
on
the
assumption
of
this,
that
to
a
proper
understanding
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but,
at
least
he
assumed
it
to
be
--
it'd
be
for
the
purpose
of
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
ask
that
assume
we
--
we
don't
agree
with
part
of
the
theories
on
laches,
is
there
anything
else
we
hope
to
hear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
else
that
he'd
passed
on
or
determine
for
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
were
not
contending
for
a
hard
and
fast
movement,
any
of
that
on
that
point
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
isn't
a
hard
and
fast
rule
as
i
understand
it,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
--
and
you
now
suggest
that
we
couldn't
do
anymore
than
in
the
a
that
the
--
that
part
of
discretion
is
of
course
true,
is
there
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
contend
your
entire
report
on
that.
all
i
wanted
is
whether
--
whether
if
we
do
not
go
with
the
--
if
you
go
with
the
court
on
that,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
you
to
reverse.
this
court
finds
the
opposite
and
didn't
have
demand
as
the
matter
too.
it
does
go
backward.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
conflict
of
interest
doesn't
imply
fraud,
does
it?
the
conflict
of
interest
is
not
a
difficulty
as
the
law
faces,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
nothing,
but
it's
--
apart
from
fraud,
it
comes
from
the
difficulty
of
(inaudible)
is
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
but
the
law
may
count
upon
a
situation
in
which
there
is,
in
fact,
or
was
in
fact
the
conflict
of
issues
in
this
sense
that
the
insurance
company
did
represent
in
both
sides
without
a
particular
or
efficient
in
the
ware
at
the
time
having
--
except
to
find
out
and
that
rule
was
imperfectly
stated
with
the
general
--
the
situation
in
which
it
does
operate
--
as
form
would
operate,
as
efficiently
important
for
the
law
that
constituted
with
the
general
decision
of
the
state
(inaudible)
important.
even
though
--
even
though
it
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
otherwise,
it's
a
specific
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
much
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
the
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
it,
what
situation
of
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
is
the
company's
(inaudible)
