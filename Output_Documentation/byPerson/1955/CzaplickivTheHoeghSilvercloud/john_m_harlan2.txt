did
he
have
a
lawyer
at
this
stage?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
if
you
brought
an
action
now
against
the
insurance
company
for
breach
of
trust,
that
their
statute
of
limitations
is
run
on
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wouldn't
have
thought
it
would
but
i
was
just
wondering.

ten-year
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
take
the
facts
for
a
moment
to
the
other
point
that
you
left
and
ask
you
a
question.
assuming
the
trust
theory
of
the
assignee
of
the
cause
of
action,
supposing
you
had
a
case
where
the
compensation
award
was
very
large
and
where
the
assignees
had
well,
i
don't
believe
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
i'm
ever
going
to
recover
that
kind
of
a
verdict.
would
he
have
to
sue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
leaving
out
the
conflict
of
interest
because
i
think
my
question
has
a
bearing
upon
whether
or
not,
this
--
you're
in
the
right
--
pursuit
of
the
right
remedy
as
you
got
a
clear
conflict
of
interest,
there's
no
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
have
a
question
in
my
own
mind
as
to
whether
you
can
translate
that
into
requiring
a
joinder
or
reassignment
of
this
cause
of
action
as
distinguished
of
an
independent
suit
against
the
trustee
for
breach
of
trust.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
case
was
disposed
of
on
the
pleadings
that
i
take
with
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
wonder
if
that
so,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass
on
the
question
of
laws
above
on
your
standing
to
sue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
is
it
your
suggestion
that
assuming
that
we
--
assuming
that
we
go
with
you
on
the
question
of
laches,
we
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
the
question
of
the
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless
it
occurred
with
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
we
came
to
the
conclusion,
for
example,
that
you
had
no
standing
to
sue,
what
will
be
the
point
towards
sending
a
fact
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
laches
that
would
be
in.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
would
think.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
we
held
that
he
had
sent
him
to
sue
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
we
do
where
the
laches
end.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
never
had
a
chance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
answer
is
he
didn't
have
a
chance
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
district
court
didn't
asked
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
you
wait
four
years
to
bring
your
suit?
