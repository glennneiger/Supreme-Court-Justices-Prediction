you
can't
rely
on
judge
frank's
statement
now,
as
being
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
they
were
made
also
before
the
ryan
case.
you
--
you're
reading
and
saying
that
there's
no
adverse
interest
between
them
as
i
understood
you
to
read
judge
frank.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
you
--
would
you
read
from
what
you
read
from
the
statement
a
moment
ago?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
--
do
they
have
a
common
interest
now,
since
ryan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
understood
your
reading
there
from
the
statement
of
a
general
principle
under
the
admiral
--
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
something
about
what
the
record
contained
or
did
not
contain.
does
the
record
show
whether
the
insurance
company
here
would,
in
reality,
have
to
pay
any
judgment
that
was
rendered
if
this
petitioner
should
file
a
suit
on
a
third
party
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
under
your
argument,
it
should
come
within
--
would
have
control
of
where
the
suit
was
found?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
--
under
the
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
position
of
how
would
you
think
the
law
is.
i'd
understand
if
i
would
see
the
facts
on
it.
does
the
record
show
that
this
insurance
company
would
have
charged
to
a
suit
that
a
judgment,
if
rendered,
would
have
to
be
paid
by
the
insurance
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
they
do
that
in
the
court
of
admiralty
which
is
the
court
of
chancery
of
filing
the
suit
in
his
name
and
setting
up
the
facts
that
we
have
filed
again
because
of
an
adverse
interest
from
the
part
of
the
other
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
that
would
require
us
to
go
through
an
injunction
proceeding
which
has
probably
come
all
the
way
up
here
before
he
drive
lawsuits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it,
as
to
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
have
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
that,
would
he,
unless
he
had
adverse
efforts
and
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
not
be
a
better
idea,
might
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
had
an
adverse
interest,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
that's
filed
if
they
go
into
court
and
let
them
know
that
they
have
an
adverse
interest
and
they
should
put
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
just
read
the
hunt
case
in
this,
representing
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
find
where
the
employers
there
had
an
adverse
interest,
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
assume
what
is
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
may
have
i
just
read
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
referred
to,
there
is
no
--
maybe
in
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
--
maybe
you
didn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
working
for
this
(inaudible)
shipping
company,
injured
while
unloading
the
steamship
owned
and
operated
by
the
bank
line's
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe,
i
just
read
it
there.
