mr.
henry
hammer
may
it
please
your
honors.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
by
this
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
which
reversed
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
solely
as
--
as
to
the
factual
issue
of
damages
assessed
by
a
jury,
as
reduced
by
the
trial
judge
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
new
trial
confined
to
this
issue.
the
questions
presented
herein
are
important
questions
of
law
pertaining
to
federal
appellate
review,
which
are
first
does
a
federal
appellate
court
have
the
power
to
review
the
inadequacy
or
excessiveness
of
a
jury
verdict
in
an
action
brought
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
where
the
damages
are
unliquidated,
and
not
ascertainable
with
mathematical
certainty.
secondly,
as
an
order
of
the
district
judge
refusing
to
grant
a
new
trial
pursuant
to
which
a
plaintiff
remits
a
portion
of
the
verdict
subject
to
review
by
a
federal
appellate
court.
and
we
submit
if
the
court
please,
that
before
going
questions
include
as
fairly
comprised
therein
in
accordance
with
rule
41
(d)
(1)
of
the
rules
of
this
court.
the
subsidiary
question
of
whether
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
instant
case
committed
error
in
reviewing
the
factual
issue
of
damages
found
by
a
jury
as
reduced
by
the
trial
judge,
whether
damages
were
unliquidated,
not
ascertainable
with
mathematical
certainty
and
rested
upon
in
absolute
elements
and
where
the
petitioner
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
judge
refusing
a
new
trial
remitted
a
portion
of
the
verdict.
the
facts
in
this
case
briefly
are
these,
the
petitioner,
as
the
administrator
of
the
estate
--
of
his
deceased
son,
william
neese,
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
eastern
district
of
south
carolina
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
recover
damages
against
the
respondent
company
for
his
negligence
in
having
provide
petitioners
interstate,
son,
age
22
years,
a
safe
place
to
work
as
the
result
of
which
he
was
struck
and
killed
by
a
train
of
the
respondent
railroad
company,
while
engaged
in
its
employee
as
a
car
inspector
at
its
yards
in
columbia,
south
carolina.
the
case
was
tried
before
the
district
judge
and
a
jury
and
resulted
in
a
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
for
the
benefit
of
the
parents,
of
the
deceased
son,
who
are
the
beneficiaries
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
in
the
sum
of
$60,000.
the
damages
assessed
by
the
jury,
as
reduced
by
the
trial
judge,
which
under
the
act
is
compensation
for
loss
of
reasonably
expected
pecuniary
benefits,
which
will
have
resulted
to
the
parents
from
the
continued
life
of
the
deceased
son
and
which
damages
were
unliquidated
and
not
ascertainable
with
mathematical
certainty
was
supported
by
the
record
evidence
of
the
earning
capacity
of
the
deceased,
his
habits
or
clear
this
and
tendencies
to
provide
for
the
support
and
maintenance
of
his
parents,
the
amounts
that
the
parents
would
have
require
for
their
support
and
maintenance,
which
amounts
together
with
the
son's
services
on
the
basis
of
his
past
(inaudible)
conduct,
the
parents
could
have
reasonably
expected
from
him
as
he
not
met
his
untimely
death.
after
the
entry
of
judgment
on
the
verdict,
the
respondent
company
filed
a
motion
for
judgment,
non
obstante
veredicto
or
the
alternative
for
a
new
trial.
the
district
judge
refused
the
motion
for
judgment
non
obstante
veredicto
and
having
found
that
the
damages
were
excessive
but
not
the
result
of
passion,
prejudice
or
caprice
and
also
refused
to
grant
a
new
trial
condition,
however,
upon
the
petitioner
remitting
$10,000
of
the
verdict.
this,
the
petitioner's
dad
and
accordingly
judgment
for
the
reduced
amount
of
$50,000
was
duly
entered.
thereupon,
the
respondent
company
appealed
to
the
court
below,
which
on
appeal
affirmed
as
to
the
issue
of
liability,
but
after
having
to
review
the
way
and
appraise
the
evidence
as
to
the
factual
issue
of
damages
upon
which
fair-minded
men
could
disagree
and
reach
different
conclusions,
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
concluded
that
the
damage
were
excessive
and
not
supported
by
the
record
and
consequently
reversed
as
to
this
--
as
to
the
issue
of
damages
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
confined
to
this
issue.
adverting,
if
the
court
please,
to
the
questions
presented
for
the
determination
of
the
court,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
in
the
instant
case
committed
clear
error
in
reviewing
the
factual
issue
of
damages
assessed
by
the
jury,
as
reduced
by
the
trial
judge
where
the
damages
herein
were
unliquidated
and
rested
upon
in
absolute
elements
and
where
the
petitioner,
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
judge
remitted
a
portion
of
the
verdict.
we
rest
our
contention,
if
your
honors
please,
upon
a
well
settled
principles
of
law.
a
principle
of
law
firmly
established
by
a
long
and
non-broken
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
a
federal
appellate
court
will
not
review
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
in
refusing
or
granting
a
new
trial.
and
this
rule
is
applicable
where
the
ground
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
that
the
damages
awarded
by
the
jury
were
inadequate
or
accepted.
mr.
henry
hammer
in
my
opinion,
i
do
not
believe
the
question
was
reserved.
mr.
henry
hammer
in
the
fairmount
case,
mr.
justice
brandeis
who
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
simply
said
they
were
not
presented
with
the
question
as
to
whether
they
can
review
for
abuse
of
discretion,
the
refusal
of
a
trial
judge
to
grant
damages
where
the
jury
does
not
award
substantial
damages.
mr.
henry
hammer
to
that
extent,
i
agree
with
your
honor,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
but
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
we
read
the
full
import
of
the
decision
and
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brandeis,
we
find
that
he
said
and
clear
in
an
unmistakable
language
this
that
the
mere
refusal
of
a
trial
judge
to
grant
a
new
trial
where
the
jury
awards
normal
damages
is
clearly
not
abuse
of
discretion.
and
he
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
you
--
your
honor
presents
the
most
difficult
question,
but
i
think
i
will
answer
it
in
this
fashion
that
rather
than
to
tear
down
the
benefits
of
the
safeguards
of
a
jury
system
provided
in
the
constitution,
it
would
be
far
better
in
an
isolated
case
to
commit
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
jury.
and
we
must
remember
that
the
safeguards
of
controlling
the
verdict
of
a
jury
which
is
excessive
is
placed
in
the
district
judges.
and
we
must
rely
upon
them
for
safeguarding
the
jury
verdict
or
appraising
the
jury
verdicts.
and
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said,
we
must
be
slow
to
impute
the
juries,
a
disregard
of
that
duty
and
to
trial
judges,
a
lack
of
diligence
in
appraising
the
conduct
of
the
jury.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
say
this
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
say
this
when
we
were
adverting
the
question,
your
honor,
posed
to
me
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
when
we
refer
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brandeis,
he
said
in
this
in
the
fairmount
case.
he
said
that
this
court
has
frequently
refused
to
disturb
a
trial
judge
--
the
judge's
approval
of
a
jury
verdict,
which
seemed
excessive
or
inadequate.
and
he
cited
among
other
cases,
the
cases
--
the
case
of
southern
railway
carolina
division
versus
bennett,
a
case
in
which
the
facts
were
less
stronger.
mr.
henry
hammer
if
we
follow
the
argument
of
respondent
and
proceeding
with
reference
to
the
question
your
honor
posed
me,
if
we
permit
an
appellate
court
to
exercise
discretionary
power
over
the
power
vested
in
the
trial
judge
by
the
common
law,
the
effect
would
be
to
nullify
completely
the
discretion
vested
in
the
trial
judge
by
the
common
law
and
would
in
fact
be
place
in
the
arbitrary
power
in
the
appellate
court.
and
as
mr.
justice
clark
said
in
knauff
versus
shaughnessy,
that
the
word
discretion
means
anything,
it
means
that
it
must
be
exercised
by
the
recipient
of
the
power
according
to
his
own
understanding
and
conscience.
mr.
henry
hammer
exactly.
mr.
henry
hammer
i'm
not
--
i'm
mindful,
if
your
honor
please,
of
what
this
court
said
in
langnus
v.
green
that
they
cannot
exercise
an
arbitrary
discretion,
that
they
must
exercise
a
sound
discretion
in
accordance
with
what
is
just,
right
and
inequitable,
but
it
must
be
directed
by
their
own
conscience
and
judgment
to
a
just
result,
not
the
conscience
and
judgment
of
someone
else
or
the
court
of
appeals
because
that
in
effect
would
completely
nullify
the
discretion
vested
in
the
trial
judge
by
the
common
law
and
will
open
the
doors
to
a
parade
of
litigants
to
the
federal
appellate
courts,
the
ultimate
result
which
would
be
that
in
every
case
where
the
trial
judges'
discretion
was
involved,
we
--
this
court
would
be
flooded
with
petitions
for
writs
of
certiorari.
mr.
henry
hammer
common
law
with
reference
to
review
of
the
findings
of
a
jury
is
the
law,
which
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
seventh
amendment.
at
that
time,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
there
was
known
three
cause,
as
the
court
of
king's
bench,
exchequer
and
common
pleas,
which
were
composed
of
trial
judges
traveling
from
one
circuit
to
another.
and
when
the
motions
for
a
new
trial
came
up,
they
were
addressed
to
the
entire
court
sitting
en
banc
as
a
whole
and
they
were
not
appellate
courts.
they
were
the
same
courts.
they
were
not
different
courts
sitting
as
an
appellate
court.
and
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
if
in
metropolitan
versus
moore
cited
in
our
brief,
with
reference
to
the
practice,
which
existed
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
motions
for
new
trial
were
addressed
to
the
court
en
banc,
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
the
court
en
banc
was
not
an
appellate
court.
and
that
if
it
did
said
as
an
appellate
court,
it
would
likely
be
unconstitutional
for
--
to
have
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
view
of
the
expressed
prohibition
of
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
provides
that
no
fact,
tried
by
a
jury
shall
be
otherwise
reexamined
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
and
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law.
mr.
henry
hammer
1791.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
believe
was
1791
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct,
sir,
as
being
--
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
i
agree
with,
your
honor,
that
that
was
simply
one
of
the
reasons.
and
when
i
say
that,
i
mean
the
historical
limitation
of
the
writ
of
error
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
adverts
i
believe.
under
the
old
cases,
one
of
the
reasons
for
refusing
to
review
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
in
refusing
to
grant
a
new
trial
was
the
historical
limitation
of
the
writ
of
error.
that
has
been
abolished
and
we
do
not
rely
upon
that
for
our
contention.
but
we
do
rely
and
we
vigorously
rely
for
our
contention
upon
the
expressed
prohibition
of
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
which
provides
it.
no
fact
tried
by
the
jury
shall
be
otherwise
reexamine
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
then
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law.
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
sir.
i
believe
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law,
the
district
judge
had
the
discretionary
power
to
control
the
amount
of
damages
rendered
by
the
jury.
as
i
read
parsons
versus
bedford
decided
by
this
court
back
in
1830,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
story,
he
states
the
rules
of
the
common
law
which
were
that
a
new
trial
or
that
facts
found
by
a
jury
maybe
reexamined
by
the
trial
court
or
the
court
to
which
the
record
was
detainable
and
upon
a
new
trial,
a
trial
de
novo,
granted
by
an
appellate
court
for
some
error
of
law.
that
was
the
common
law,
mr.
justice
harlan.
as
i
read
it
according
to
the
decision
of
parsons
versus
bedford.
the
constitutional
limitation
has
a
reason
for
refusing
or
not
giving
or
prohibiting
the
federal
appellate
courts
from
exercising
the
power
to
review
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
is
deeply
rooted
in
our
jurisprudence.
we
find
it
clearly
stated
by
mr.
justice
holland,
the
late
mr.
justice
holland,
in
railroad
company
versus
(inaudible)
in
which
he
clearly
relies
upon
a
constitutional
limitation
as
a
reason
for
refusing
the
appellate
courts,
the
power
to
review
the
action
of
a
trial
judge.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct,
trial
by
jury.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct,
sir.
and
that's
in
cases
where
the
trial
is
by
a
jury.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir,
it
is
a
trial
of
the
matter
of
fact,
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
by
--
mr.
henry
hammer
the
judge
is
determining
question
--
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
he
is.
he
is
given
that
power.
mr.
henry
hammer
other
than
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law
and
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law,
the
trial
judge
was
vested
the
discretionary
power
to
set
aside
a
verdict
when
his
discretion
is
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
think
it
is,
sir.
i
think
he
would
be
doing
that.i
would
treat
it
clearly
as
weighing
the
evidence,
reaching
a
finding
a
fact
different
than
that
reached
by
the
jury
and
he
has
the
right.
mr.
henry
hammer
your
honor,
with
reference
to
that
question,
again,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
this
language
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
fairmount
case,
where
he
notes
the
circumstances
at
length
under
which
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
maybe
reviewed
in
connection
with
his
refusal
to
grant
a
new
trial
and
they
are
these.
mr.
henry
hammer
but
when
we
read
the
decision,
we
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
interfere
with
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
only
under
the
circumstances
noted
in
the
fairmount
case.
and
that
is,
one,
where
the
trial
judge
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
acts
under
the
erroneous
belief
that
he
has
no
power
to
grant
the
motion
or
he
erroneously
excludes
from
the
consideration
of
the
motion
matters,
which
are
appropriate
to
a
decision
on
a
motion.
also,
in
cases
where
the
trial
judge
refuses
to
grant
a
new
trial
with
the
damages
exceed
a
statutory
limit
or
are
more
or
less
than
an
undisputed
amount
or
are
clearly
in
contravention
of
the
instructions
of
the
court
or
are
based
upon
erroneous
instruction.
and
in
additional
circumstance
is
where
the
damages
are
the
result
of
passion,
prejudice
and
caprice.
but
clearly,
none
of
such
circumstances
is
present
in
the
instant
case,
so
we
submit
merely
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
call
a
review
of
a
factual
issue
of
damages,
a
view
--
and
abuse
of
discretion
or
a
review
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
does
not
in
itself
justify
the
court
of
appeals
from
exercising
the
power
to
review.
and
we
submit
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
instant
case
was
exactly
that.
it
reviewed
and
weighed
the
factual
issue
of
damages
merely
by
calling
it
a
review
of
the
action
of
the
trial
judge
for
abuse
of
discretion.
it
employ
the
process
of
reasoning,
which
judge
learned
hand
of
the
second
circuit
criticized
as
a
scholastic
refinement
of
reasoning
leading
to
an
impracticable
rule.
and
we
urged
that
just
as
this
court
in
tiller
versus
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
company
reasoned
and
concluded
that
the
very
same
court
below
cannot
permit
the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk
in
a
federal
employers'
liability
case
by
merely
changing
its
name
or
calling
it
abuse
of
discretion,
so
likewise
in
the
instant
case.
the
court
below
should
not
be
permitted
to
review
the
factual
issue
of
damages
assessed
by
a
jury,
as
reduced
by
a
trial
judge,
merely
by
changing
its
name
to
a
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
henry
hammer
in
my
opinion,
i
believe
he
matched
those
cases
to
show
that
where
there
are
facts
upon
which
reasonable
men
might
reach
different
conclusions.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
appellate
courts
cannot
undergo
circumstances
to
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
henry
hammer
and
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
in
my
opinion
is
a
very
important
case
cited
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
when
he
made
the
statement
that
he
affect,
“this
court
has
frequently
refrained
from
disturbing
a
trial
court
the
approval
of
an
award
of
damages
which
seemed
accessible
and
adequate
and
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
generally
follow
this
similar
policy.”
and
i
refer
to
the
case
of
southern
railway-carolina
division
versus
bennett.
that
case
was
an
action
brought
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
which
the
damages,
in
which
the
facts
were
somewhat
analogous
to
those
in
the
instant
case.
there
is
held,
the
respondent
or
rather
the
railroad
company
urged
that
based
upon
the
earning
capacity
of
the
deceased,
his
life
expectancy
and
the
amount
of
contributions
that
he
could
or
would
have
made
to
his
beneficiaries
under
the
act,
the
present
cash
value
of
the
future
benefits
could
not
exceed
$10,000,
whereas
a
judgment
of
the
lower
court
and
the
sum
of
$20,000
was
entered.
this
court
rejected
the
argument
of
the
respondent
company
and
refused
to
treat
as
mathematical
certainties,
the
life
expectancy
of
the
deceased,
his
earning
capacity
and
the
amount
of
contributions
that
he
could
or
would
have
made
to
the
beneficiaries
under
the
act
and
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
for
$20,000.
mr.
henry
hammer
exactly.
they
said
that
--
mr.
henry
hammer
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
this
court
said
that
a
case
of
mere
excess
on
the
record
is
a
matter
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
trial
judge
and
presents
no
case
for
reexamination
or
presents
no
question
for
reexaminations
by
this
court.
in
our
case,
if
the
court
please,
the
facts
are
much
stronger
than
those
in
the
cited
case.
here
--
mr.
henry
hammer
he
said
any
case,
which
presents
a
mere
excess
upon
--
a
mere
excess
upon
the
record
or
upon
the
evidence
does
not
present
a
question
for
reexamination
in
this
--
in
this
court.
and
in
our
case,
the
fact
is
so
much
stronger
than
those
in
the
bennett
case.
here,
we
have
a
young
boy,
22
years
of
age,
who
is
here,
he
left
surviving
his
parents,
his
earning
capacity
if
he
had
lived
at
the
time
of
the
trial
would
have
been
$4300
a
year.
and
with
the
prevailing
yearly
increases
in
wages
amongst
railway
workers,
the
jury
certainly
had
a
right
to
infer
that
his
wages
would
have
been
even
more
with
increase
seniority
and
experience.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
relationship
between
the
boy
and
the
parents
was
close.
he
stayed
at
home,
he
live
at
home,
did
chores
around
the
house
with
his
parents
and
even
offered
to
them,
of
course,
during
the
time,
there
was
nothing
to
eat.
his
full
paycheck
to
do
with
them
as
they
please
and
he
made
the
expression
or
expressed
himself
that
he
would
provide
for
his
parents
as
long
as
they
live.
we
also
had
the
evidence
of
record
that
the
father
was
planning
to
retire
and
that
he
would
need
for
his
financial
support
upon
his
retirement,
the
sum
of
approximately
$3300
per
year
exclusive
of
his
independent
income.
which
amounts,
we
submit,
upon
the
bases
of
the
past
statute
in
conduct
of
the
deceased
together
with
the
son's
services,
the
parents
could
have
reasonably
expected
had
he
not
met
his
untimely
death.
and
computing
the
amount
of
damages
mathematically
according
to
standards,
annuity
tables
and
standard
mortality
tables,
the
present
cash
value
of
the
future
benefits
that
would
have
accrued
to
the
parents
exceeds
$50,000.
and
we
submit
that
when
--
that
when
the
court
below
undertook
to
review,
weigh
and
appraise
the
evidence
and
when
it
viewed
the
evidence
in
the
like
most
favorable
to
the
respondent
company
is
that
of
in
the
like
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
as
it
was
required
to
do
on
appeal
according
to
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
and
when
he
treated
as
mathematical
certainties,
the
life
expectancies
of
the
parents,
the
ironic
passage
of
the
deceased,
the
safe
rate
of
interest
that
money
was
earned
and
the
amount
of
contributions
that
the
son
would
have
given
to
the
parents
without
taking
into
consideration,
the
different
status
of
the
parents
during
the
life
of
the
deceased
and
their
changed
status
wherein
they
would
be
in
need
of
financial
support
upon
the
father's
retirement.
the
trial
judge
or
rather
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
invaded
the
province
of
the
jury
and
clearly
usurped
the
prerogative
of
the
trial
judge
contrary
to
the
firmest
established
principles
of
this
court
and
contrary
to
the
expressed
prohibition
of
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and
we
submit
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence,
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
upon
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
waived
the
evidence.
it
clearly
constituted
reversible
error.
and
moreover,
we
submit
that
when
we
consider
that
the
petitioner
in
the
instant
case
remitted
a
portion
of
the
verdict
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
trial
judge
refusing
a
new
trial.
it
furnishes
additional
reasons
based
upon
equitable
considerations
why
a
federal
court
should
not
be
permitted
to
review
the
factual
issue
of
damages.
we
say
that
it
would
hardly
be
fair
to
a
plaintiff
who
remits
a
portion
of
the
verdict
pursuing
to
the
order
of
a
trial
judge
refusing
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
that
the
error
of
excessiveness
if
any
is
cured
thereby.
and
for
reasons
of
public
policy
and
public
convenience
as
stated
by
this
court
in
the
old
case
of
(inaudible)
cited
in
our
brief
appeals
in
matters
of
discretion
should
not
be
encouraged.
and
borrowing
if
i
may
from
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
dickinson
industrial
site
versus
cowan
appeals
in
matters
of
discretion
should
not
be
allowed
because
to
do
so
would
encouraged
an
unseemly
parade
of
litigants
to
the
appellate
courts
and
that
to
the
time
and
expense
of
the
administration
of
justice.
and
as
stated
in
13
federal
rules
of
decisions,
page
67
in
an
article
in
federal
employers'
liability
act,
the
grounds
of
such
appeals
would
be
but
prevalent
and
the
purposes
to
delay
the
payment
of
merit
and
verdicts,
the
needy
clients
and
thereby
force
upon
them
inadequate
sentence.
now
if
the
court
please,
adverting
to
the
contentions
of
the
respondent
railroad
company
which
is
narrowed
down
on
pages
23
and
24
of
it's
brief,
we
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
significant
admission
made
by
it
that
according
to
the
weight
of
authority
in
the
decisions
from
1789
down
to
the
decision
in
the
fairmount
case
in
1932.
the
federal
appellate
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
instant
case
did
not
have
the
power
to
review
the
factual
questions,
which
it
reviewed
in
the
instant
case.
this
submission
is
made
by
respondent
with
two
reservations
upon
which
it
relies
for
it's
contention
that
a
federal
appellate
court
has
the
power
now
to
review
the
factual
issue
for
damages.
its
first
contention
is
that
because
the
historical
limitations
of
the
writ
of
error
was
abolished
and
that
having
been
a
reason
which
it
seeks
to
create
the
impression
was
the
sole
reason
for
the
refusal
to
review
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
in
granting
a
new
trial.
the
rule
itself
has
become
obsolete
and
must
disappear.
the
short
answer
to
that
contention,
if
the
court
please,
is
simply
this,
and
although
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
refusal
to
review
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
in
refusing
or
granting
a
new
trial
was
the
historical
limitation
of
the
writ
of
error,
another
and
more
coaching
and
compelling
reason
was
the
expressed
prohibition
of
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir,
that
would
be
the
same
answer.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
think
if
we
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
think
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
think
if
the
court
--
the
trial
judge
sitting
in
judgment
upon
that
verdict
is
of
the
opinion
that
it
should
stand.
i
think
we
have
received
the
benefits
of
the
safeguards,
which
the
law
provides.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
don't
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
follows
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
henry
hammer
(inaudible)
i
understand
they
did
the
same
thing
and
i
say
that
they
acted
in
contravention
of
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and
i
say
as
--
mr.
henry
hammer
your
honor,
i
can't
believe
that
there's
any
district
judge
in
the
united
states
that
we
have
to
fear
would
not
take
care
of
a
judgment.
and
i
--
just
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
the
opinion
which
he
read
earlier
this
afternoon,
there's
no
reason
to
fear
that
because
if
we
have
that
problem,
the
people
would
rise
up
and
see
to
it
that
the
seventh
amendment
was
repelled
and
changed
so
that
such
situations
could
be
taken
care
of.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
still
think
our
country
is
founded
upon
our
people
and
if
the
people
don't
care,
i
don't
know
who
are.
and
if
we're
to
preserve
the
jury
system,
we
cannot
permit
federal
appellate
courts
under
such
circumstances
to
use
its
own
discretion
as
to
what
is
a
reasonable
verdict
or
reasonable
amount
of
damages.
there
are
maybe
isolated
instances
where
the
courts
go
wrong
but
i
think
therefore,
apply.
and
if
we
will
permit
that
change
of
the
federal
appellate
courts
to
review
the
action
of
a
trial
judge
and
we
can't
depend
upon
the
trial
judges
and
i
think
it's
high
time
for
us
to
device
a
different
system
of
selecting
our
judiciary.
mr.
henry
hammer
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
henry
hammer
but
the
verdict
must
be
the
result
of
capriciousness
as
your
honor
said,
but
this
court
in
this
case
has
clearly
indicated
that
the
result
was
not
to
--
that
the
verdict
was
not
the
result
of
capriciousness
because
if
it
did,
it
would
have
reversed
the
whole
case
because
the
verdict
would
had
tainted
with
that
capriciousness
and
no
part
of
it
could
stand.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
say
that
--
i
say
the
court
can
say
it
with
reference
to
certain
circumstances
as
noted
in
the
fairmount
case
when
--
when
it
permits
a
court
to
weigh
the
evidence,
then
we
are
giving
the
federal
appellate
court
the
power
of
the
jury.
and
just
as
mr.
--
mr.
henry
hammer
the
power
of
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
but
i
say
that
where
there
are
facts
sufficient
to
support
what
the
jury
found
then
the
only
other
judicial
officer
who
may
examine
those
facts
and
weigh
them
as
the
trial
judge,
otherwise,
we
might
as
well
scrap
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
exceed
to
that
qualification,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
think
their
mathematics
is
entirely
wrong.
i
think
when
they
say
that
5%
--
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
i
--
i'm
not
--
i
wouldn't
argue
that
point
too
vigorously.
we
all
can
differ
about
mathematical
computations
about
what
is
the
safe
rate
of
interest
about
what
a
boy
who's
closed
to
his
family
would
contribute
which
subject
to
different
inferences,
different
conclusions,
fairmount
may
reach
different
conclusions.
i
don't
say
that
their
conclusion
is
not
a
reasonable
one
but
i
say
theirs
is
not
the
only
conclusion.
mr.
henry
hammer
the
state
of
south
carolina
clearly
permits
no
review
by
appellate
court
of
the
issue
advantages.
they
simply
say
that
it's
clearly
a
matter
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
trial
judge
unless
the
trial
judge
finds
that
there's
passion,
prejudice
or
caprice
and
then
in
all
circumstances,
the
whole
verdict
is
tainted
with
that
capriciousness
and
accordingly,
it
cannot
stand.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
henry
hammer
now,
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
henry
hammer
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
listened
carefully
to
my
opponent's
argument
wherein
he
says,
that
the
congressional
amendments
to
the
judiciary
act
as
work
they
changed
in
the
rule
against
non-review.
i
can't
find
no
place
in
any
of
those
enactments
where
congress
says
that
a
federal
appellate
court
can
review
the
factual
findings
of
a
jury.
in
fact,
if
they
said
that,
it
certainly
would
be
unconstitutional
under
the
seventh
amendment.
and
moreover,
i
call
to
the
courts
attention
to
the
chief
revises
notes
on
title
28,
the
federal
judiciary
code,
of
the
honorable
william
m.barron,
who
is
the
co-author
of
barron
&
holtzoff
of
the
book
federal
practice
and
procedure.
and
therein,
he
says
this
in
no
uncertain
language,
i
haven't
cited
in
my
brief
but
it's
stated
in
volume
2
at
page
809.
he
says
this.
and
this
is
a
statement
made
after
the
adoption
of
the
federal
codes
or
after
the
revision
of
the
federal
codes,
"the
principle
that
in
a
law
action,
the
question
of
damages
cannot
be
reexamined
in
an
the
appellate
court
for
excessiveness
or
insufficiency,
still
applies
in
jury
cases
because
of
the
seventh
amendment
for
the
constitution."
that
clearly
expresses
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
judicial
code
or
revising
the
judicial
code.
mr.
henry
hammer
we
do
not
have
that
in
our
brief,
and
i'm
sorry
i
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
will,
sir.
and
moreover,
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
revision,
facts
found
by
a
trial
judge
sitting
without
a
jury
were
not
subject
to
review.
but
we'll
admit
that
the
revision
did
contemplate,
that
a
federal
appellate
court
could
review
facts
found
by
a
trial
judge,
provided
however,
that
was
not
in
a
case
where
there
was
a
jury
trial.
a
counsel
makes
the
statement
to
this
court.
that
the
cases
prohibiting
federal
review
were
based
upon
case
law.
i
disagree
with
that
statement
thoroughly.
again,
i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention,
to
the
earliest
supreme
court
decision,
we
have
found
on
a
subject.
in
parsons
versus
bedford,
cited
in
our
brief.
there,
a
bill
of
exceptions
was
complained
of.
the
trial
court's
refusal
of
appellant's
application
to
one
of
the
clerks
to
record
their
testimony.
on
this
application,
the
court
said,
a
whole
lot
therefore,
of
the
application
to
the
record
to
record
the
evidence,
so
far
as
at
least
as
this
court
can
take
cognizance
of
it,
was
to
present
the
evidence
here
in
order
to
establish
the
error
of
the
verdict
in
matters
of
fact.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
that
this
assignment
was
immaterial,
because
of
the
prohibition
of
the
seventh
amendment.
the
court
couldn't
consider
in
any
event
whether
it
was
part
of
the
record
or
not
part
of
the
record.
and
we
quote,
"but
the
other
clause
of
the
amendment
is
still
more
important,
and
we
read
it
at
a
substantial
and
independent
clause
to
ethical,
no
fact
tried
by
a
jury
shall
be
otherwise
re-examinable
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
then
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law."
this
is
a
prohibition
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
reexamine
any
facts
tried
by
a
jury
in
any
other
manner.
the
only
modes
known
to
the
common
law,
to
reexamine
such
facts
or
the
granting
of
a
new
trial
by
the
court
where
the
issue
was
tried
or
to
which
the
record
was
properly
returnable,
or
the
award
of
the
venire
facias
de
novo
by
an
appellate
court
for
some
error
of
law
which
intervene
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
parsons
versus
bedford.
it's
referred
to
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief,
3
peterson
443,
a
decision
by
mr.
justice
story.
and
in
the
decision
of
railroad
company
versus
(inaudible)
decided
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
quoted
this
clause,
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
parsons
case
and
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
prohibition
does
not
permit
a
federal
appellate
court
to
review
federal
facts.
now
my
--
i
would
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
history
of
the
enactment
of
the
seventh
amendment.
as
indicating,
that
it
was
a
matter
of
concern
at
that
time,
to
the
people
to
have
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
and
at
no
fact
shall
be
examinable
in
any
court
of
united
states
and
according
to
the
common
law.
when
the
final
draft
of
the
constitution
as
transmitted
from
the
constitutional
convention
to
congress
in
1785
was
submitted
--
it
provided
this,
and
i
quote.
i
don't
have
that
in
my
brief
and
i'm
sorry.
"in
all
other
cases
before
i
mention
the
supreme
court
shall
have
appellate
jurisdiction,
both
as
to
law
and
fact
with
such
exceptions
and
under
such
regulations
as
congress
shall
make."
in
the
federal's
papers,
number
81,
hamilton
pointed
out
this
strong
opposition,
to
allowing
of
appellate
review
of
matters
of
fact,
and
then
to
finally
meet
the
objections.
congress
passed
the
seventh
amendment
providing
that
no
fact
filed
by
jury
shall
be
reexamined
by
any
court
other
than
the
rules
of
the
common
law.
if
the
common
law
permitted
a
reexamination,
and
reexamination
is
permitted
under
the
seventh
amendment.
that's
how
strong
the
feeling
was
at
that
time
against
an
appellate
court
exercising
a
review
of
factual
questions.
and
we
submit,
that
mr.
justice
brandeis'
decision
clearly
indicates
in
the
fairmount
case,
that
decision
is
rested
as
one
of
the
reasons
upon
the
prohibition
of
the
seventh
amendment.
now
referring
to
the
other
question
which
my
opponent
has
posed
to
this
court,
that
is
whether
we
have
presented
the
question
properly
to
this
court.
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
pointed
out,
we
argued
the
case
fully
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
error
--
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
we
argued
the
facts,
we
talked
about
the
facts,
and
we
showed
how
the
facts
indicated
that
there
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
we
also
call
the
court's
attention
that
in
the
brief
in
our
position
--
mr.
henry
hammer
and
the
brief
in
our
position,
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
matter
was
fully
argued
by
respondent.
and
how
in
this
court
determine
a
question,
the
questions
which
we
pose,
unless
they
consider
the
subsidiary
question
within
the
meaning
and
intent,
as
i
read
it
of
the
rule
41
(d)
(1)
of
this
court,
of
considering
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
would
leave
the
decision
of
this
nature
in
a
broader
state.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes
sir,
and
--
mr.
henry
hammer
and
i
--
mr.
henry
hammer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
believe,
in
my
opinion,
that
those
questions
presented
in
the
brief,
fairly
stated
the
questions
involved
and
it
stated
very
clearly
that
this
was
an
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
henry
hammer
in
this
kind
of
a
case
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
because,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
damages
in
this
case
are
unliquidated,
not
ascertainable
with
mathematical
certainty.
there
is
no
statutory
limit.
there
are
not
more
or
less
than
an
undisputed
amount.
they
rest
upon
in
absolute
elements,
questions
which
are
matters
to
be
determined
and
left
to
the
--
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
agree
with
you
but
i
call
the
attention
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
because
in
those
cases
the
damages
are
unliquidated.
mr.
henry
hammer
well
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i'll
do
that,
i
certainly
--
i
certainly
will,
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
was
fairly
included.
