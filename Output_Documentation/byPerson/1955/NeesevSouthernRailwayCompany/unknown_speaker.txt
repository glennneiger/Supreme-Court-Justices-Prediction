mr.
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
hammer,
if
instead
of
a
verdict
of
$50,000
here,
the
verdict
was
$150,000.
would
your
position
be
just
the
same?
unknown
speaker
as
i
--
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
suggest
at
least
that
the
district
court
has
power
to
review
excessive
judgments
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
unknown
speaker
that
--
that's
not
the
trial
of
the
case,
otherwise
by
a
jury
or
a
fact,
otherwise
by
jury,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
what's
that?
unknown
speaker
trials
by
a
jury
and
--
and
the
trial
judge
has
the
discretion
to
set
it
aside.
unknown
speaker
and
his
--
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
is
not
a
matter
--
a
trial
as
the
matter
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
judge
is
trying
a
matter
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
--
how
can
--
i
understood
you're
defending
on
the
constitutional
provision
that
you
couldn't
try
a
matter
of
fact
otherwise
by
a
jury?
unknown
speaker
but
when
he
did
that,
he'd
be
doing
it
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
exercising
his
discretion,
you
have
the
trial
as
a
matter
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
--
assume
it's
the
--
an
exercise
of
discretion
as
a
matter
of
law.
if
it
were
enacted
then,
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
is
exercising
a
matter
of
law
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
excessive,
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
says
we
have
no
occasion
to
decide
that.
unknown
speaker
and
they
said
in
that
case
that
that
was
not
a
case
for
reexamination.
unknown
speaker
not
--
not
that
they
didn't
have
the
power
to
reexamine.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
what
he
said
there
that
this
is
not
a
case
for
reexamination?
unknown
speaker
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
power
to
examine
the
excessiveness,
what
do
you
say
as
to
their
mathematics
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
--
you
would
take
in
affirmance
on
that
basis
or
--
unknown
speaker
have
you
had
occasion
to
examine
the
state
cases
that
the
state
court
--
whether
the
states
have
the
same
provision
with
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
the
very
excessiveness
--
they
don't
examine.
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
say
mr.
alderman
in
the
case
where
the
issue
was
not
as
to
how
much
money
his
son
would
contribute
to
his
parents
out
of
his
earnings
but
an
issue
of
pain
and
suffering?
there's
no
mathematical
measure
if
it's
available.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
here
and
if
that
were
here,
the
--
the
case
would
be
entirely
different.
unknown
speaker
could
i
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
alright.
why
do
you
use
the
phrase
abusive
discretion?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
use
the
phrase
abusive
discretion?
unknown
speaker
well
didn't
the
court
actually
make
a
computation
based
on
an
expected
income
of
$2500
for
a
month.
unknown
speaker
and
then
they
come
up
with
$39,000
at
the
most.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
47?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
court
do
that
when
he
says
if
he
continued
in
his
present
work,
he
would
probably
have
attained
the
salary
of
$4300
per
year.
unknown
speaker
--
his
father
received
for
the
same
position.
unknown
speaker
have
--
have
you
collected
the
cases
in
your
brief
where
this
court
has
said
we
will
consider
nothing
except
the
questions
raised
in
the
petition
to
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
weight
do
you
give
to
the
comments
of
the
advisor
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
opponent
would
say
that
--
that
the
limitation
is
in
the
language
in
cases
where
there's
been
a
trial
by
jury
for
reasons
for
which
new
trials
have
usually
been
granted
in
the
courts
of
law.
unknown
speaker
which
would
be
true
at
time
in
the
appellate
courts.
unknown
speaker
since
it
couldn't
go
up
directly
