chief

you
may,
mr.
hammer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
alderman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
not
quite
ready
for
recess.
you
might
as
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue
until
the
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
red
light
--
red
light
will
come
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
we
can
--
we
can
adjourn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
mr.
alderman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
alderman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
basis
for
--
for
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion,
that
$100
a
month
would
be
reasonable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
that
the
--
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
when
he
would
get
his
paycheck,
as
the
mother
said,
he
would
turn
it
over
to
daddy
and
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
“use
it
for
what
you
wish,”
and
the
fact
that
he
contributed
that
much
only
was,
apparently
because
that's
all
that
the
parents
wish
to
take
out
at
that
time,
but
--
but
it
didn't
mean
that
that's
all
the
boy
was
willing
to,
if
they're
more
capable
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
was
only
after
he
had
offered
it
all
to
his
parents
in
the
event
that
he
had
decided
to
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
--
suppose
the
boy
had
offered
him,
offered
the
parents
all
of
his
earnings
as
he
did
--
apparently
did
here,
there
was
evidence
to
that
effect.
and
the
parents
said,
“no,
we
don't
--
we
don't
need
anything
at
the
moment.
we
don't
want
to
take
anything
from
your
earnings
at
the
moment.”
and
the
boy
turns
out
and
saves
it
all.
he
doesn't
give
them
anything.
would
you
say
under
those
circumstances
that
they
would
have
no
right
to
recovery
because
they
didn't
take
it,
or
would
it
have
to
be
limited
to
the
amount
he
contributed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this.
did
the
court
limit
itself
to
his
own
view
that
half
a
quarter
of
his
earning
was
all
that
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
come
from
him,
or
did
it
take
in
to
consideration
the
fact
that
the
had
tendered
all
of
his
earnings
to
his
parents,
and
the
fact
that
even
when
they
didn't
take
it,
he
was
of
a
saving
disposition
that
he
worked
hard
around
the
little
ranch
that
they
had,
and
that
he
had
this
money
available
there
to
all
the
terms
and
purposes
for
whatever
use
his
parents
might
want
to
make
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
--
that's
very
important
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
in
the
opinion
does
it
say
they
took
that
all
into
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
the
--
but
do
they
say
in
there
that
they
took
that
into
consideration
when
they
get
over
to
the
paragraph
on
--
on
page
50.
they
say,
if
we
assume,
however,
that
the
parents
reasonably
could
have
expected
an
average
contribution
of
$100
per
month
for
the
rest
of
their
lives,
what
is
the
present
value
of
such
an
expectation?
and
then
they
say,
“we
shall
assume
this
optimum
conditions.”
now,
what
is
there
in
the
evidence
or
in
their
opinion
that
shows
their
reasoning
in
making
this
$100
represent
the
most
optimum
conditions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
is
there
in
here
to
show
that
--
that
it
should
be
one-fourth
of
his
earnings,
let
us
say
rather
than
a
third
of
his
earnings?
and
--
and
what
is
there
of
certainty
in
the
facts
that
would
compel
anyone
to
arrive
at
this
$100
a
month
instead
of
some
larger
sum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
--
they
don't
grab
that
consideration
to
the
district
court,
do
they,
to
use
3.5%,
4%
or
5%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
47.
chief
justice
earl
warren
47.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
alderman,
if
this
court
was
to
hold
of
this
--
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
decision
was
--
was
such
that
a
reasonable
--
the
facts
were
such
that
reasonable
people
might
come
to
different
conclusions
on
it
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
abusive
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
district
court.
would
that
particularly
concern
you?
disturb
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
would
say
we
did
that
without
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
say
we
did
that
without
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
case
between
the
two
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
you
argue
the
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
no,
here
--
i
mean
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
alderman,
i
--
i'm
looking
now
at
--
at
your
brief
opposing
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
that's
filed
february
9
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
you
take
as
your
second
argument
there
the
fact
the
verdict
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
say
petitioner
in
contending
that
the
verdict
was
supported
by
the
evidence
calculates
the
decision
after
the
retirement
of
his
father
which
has
not
yet
occurred
would
contribute
$3300
a
year.
and
then
you
go
on
to
say
this
calculation
is
made
on
the
basis
of
what
he
states
are
the
needs
of
the
family
and
so
forth
and
then
you
state
what
--
what
he
did
not
establish,
and
then
you
come
to
conclusion
that
the
verdict
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
why
then
--
why
then
would
you
say
that
we
didn't
consider
--
weren't
interested
in
the
merits
of
this
case
when
we
considered
it
on
--
on
certiorari?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
one
of
your
argument
here.
you
didn't
say
you
hadn't
raised
that
question,
you
met
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
met
it
here
and
argued
it
before
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
alderman,
suppose
the,
suppose
the
court
in
this
case
said
--
it
said
that
it
considered
that
$50
a
month
would've
been
all
that
was
reasonable
and
they
had
had
decided
on
that
basis
rather
than
$100
a
month.
would
you
think
then
that
that
was
something
that
this
court
should
take
cognizance
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
alderman,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
labor
it
too
far,
but
what
i
would
like
to
ask
is
this.
is
there
in
your
opinion,
is
there
any
limit
upon
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
district
court
for
refusing
to
grant
a
new
trial?
and
if
in
this
case,
the
court
had
assumed
that
$50
was
enough
for
as
much
as
could
have
been
expected
to
come
from
this
boy
and
his
parents?
and
it
stated
that
in
the
opinion
as
it
did
here,
the
$100
basis,
would
you
say
that
that
is
a
matter
we
could
concern
ourselves
with
or
if
not
$50,
say
$40
or
$30
or
$20
or
$10
or
any
other
amount,
is
there
any
limit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
suppose,
just
to
use
the
same
figures
that
some
other
--
the
justice
used
a
little
awhile
ago.
supposed
they
said
$1
a
month
is
sufficient
instead
of
$100,
what
--
should
this
--
should
this
court
then
concern
itself
in
the
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wasn't
asking
exactly
that
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
asking
whether
that
would
be
beyond
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
dividing
line
in
this
case
as
you
would
see
it?
does
it
have
to
be
exactly
$100
a
month
or
one
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
you
say
that
--
can
you
say
that
the
amount
of
the
district
court
considered
fair,
$50,000
is
unreasonable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
alderman.
mr.
hammer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief,
mr.
--
?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
send
--
send
it
to
us
please
in
form
of
a
memo,
enough
copies
of
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
citation
is
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
finish
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
alderman,
if
you
should
wish
to
--
to
give
us
a
memorandum
concerning
that
matter
that
--
that
mr.
hammer
is
going
to
submit,
feel
free
to
do
it.
