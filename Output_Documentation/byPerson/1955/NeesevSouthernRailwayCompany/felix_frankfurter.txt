justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
this
very
question
left
open
the
last
time
the
case
was
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
wasn't
it
in
fairmount
glass?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
by
leaving
it
opened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
it
make?
was
there
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
--
in
that
case
under
the
circumstances
of
that
record
which
is
a
very
different
thing
in
a
general
(inaudible)
in
that
case
that
he
(inaudible)
and
the
reason
for
doing
it
in
the
relation
of
dissent
that
the
question
was
(inaudible)
and
abuse
of
discretion
can
be
claimed
that
they
do
for
appellate
review
where
they
--
whether
--
whether
they
complete
this
harmony
between
what
the
record
show
that
the
damages
were
(inaudible),
then
he
found
can
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
(inaudible)
question
of
law
and
therefore
reviewed.
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
saying
he
gave
any
light
of
what
he
thought.
well,
i
have
my
own
discretion
reading
between
the
lines.
that's
what
i'd
say
if
it's
explicitly
left
opened
and
when
you
got
that
question
in
front
of
you,
i
don't
think
it
helps
and
support
much
what
you
told
in
that
decision
of
the
foreclosure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
your
case.
that's
the
case
you're
arguing
but
not
what
this
court
is
foreclosing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
making
the
argument
not
i.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
refusing
to
disturb
and
saying
you
have
that
power
is
the
difference
between
an
active
proposition
and
a
live
exercise
to
have
a
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
discretion
doesn't
usually
mean
you
can
go
back
in
the
judges
that
they
could
do
what
they
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
definition
of
judicial
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
the
common
law
in
this
--
in
this
conflict?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
common
law
had
17
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
i
will
count
the
whole
history
for
that
provision
of
common
law.
and
it
had
pointed
out
in
the
miller
case
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
referred
in
the
fairmount
case,
a
very
technical
thing
of
what
physically
taken
off,
not
a
technical,
but
physically.
and
all
the
common
law
courts
had
was
the
record
and
the
record
was
the
rule
that
was
filed
with
the
clerk,
physical
things.
if
it
wasn't
part
of
that
physical
role,
it
wasn't
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
want
to
--
you
want
to
go
on
that
ground
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
wasn't
the
word
juggling
because
if
they
can
say
the
court
of
appeals
inserting
that
the
refusal
to
set
aside
the
verdict
due
to
the
trial
court's
discretion
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
has
not
declared
that
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion,
merely
(inaudible)
trial
is
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
therefore,
you
leave
the
question
open.
he
was
--
he
was
accustomed
in
way
the
words
are
used
and
many
said
that
he
pointed
out
the
court
of
appeals
to
go
underground
of
abuse
of
discretion,
even
before
that
was
relevant.
i'm
not
suggesting
he
decided
it
because
he
said
the
argument.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
the
court
is
relevant,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
in
the
earlier
(inaudible)
opinion,
the
instant
17
cases
--
if
my
count
is
wrong,
17
cases
in
this
court
in
which
this
court
refused
to
review
on
the
ground
when
they
said
it
was
an
exercise
of
discretion.
17
cases
in
which
this
court
did
not
read
on
the
common
law
indication,
but
it
was
for
the
exercise
of
discretion.
now,
why
did
it
matter
from
the
state
for
that
point,
just
for
nothing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
second
point
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hammer,
mr.
burton
asked
you
earlier
what
your
view
would
have
been
if
they've
give
him
a
verdict
of
(inaudible)
and
you
answered
according
to
your
(inaudible)
central
aspect
of
position.
i
think
if
you
give
the
same
answer
from
this
case,
the
jury
has
brought
in
a
normal
verdict
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
jury
would
find
that
there
was
negligence
and
the
man
was
killed
and
his
earning
power
was
cutoff
and
his
parents
were
vindicated
and
brought
in
(inaudible),
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
all
right?
the
juries
can
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
a
verdict
brought
in
according
to
the
instruction
of
the
jury,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
we
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i'm
talking
way
back,
years
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
that
--
although
that
requirement
derived
from
this
difficult
question
of
the
rule,
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
forever
it
may
have
imposed
and
is
(inaudible)
forever
this
physical
thing
of
what
constitutes
the
role
although
that
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hammer,
it
is
a
fact,
is
it
not,
that
there
must
have
been
--
there
must
be
a
score,
literally
a
score.
i
haven't
come
to
that.
maybe
i
will
before
i
get
to
(inaudible).
score,
in
which
the
appellate
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
courts
of
the
last
50
years
have
set
aside
verdict
as
being
either
capriciously
expected
or
proficiently
inadequate,
score
all
over
the
united
states.
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
that
you
won't
believe
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
issue
isn't
between
letting
them
do
what
they
please,
the
court
of
appeals
can
do
what
they
please
because
this
court
is
(inaudible)
isn't
it
a
question
of
letting
them
do
what
they
please
or
not
letting
them
do
it
at
all?
that
is
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
concerned
in
my
case
review
whether
50,000
or
75,000
or
40,000
is
correct.
i
know
myself
take
this
generally
be
brought
here
when
if
in
that
realm
of
confidence,
that
isn't
the
problem
we
have
to
face.
the
problem
is
whether
this
court
should
now
serve
that
the
issue
which
justice
--
the
court
left
opened
in
their
mind
(inaudible)
against
this
dispute
of
power.
that's
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
propose
to
do
that
anymore
unusual.
the
question
is
what
is
the
power
of
the
jury
and
what
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
power
of
the
jury
is
not
to
do
what
the
jury
pleases
no
matter
what
and
it's
not
the
power
of
the
jury
that
if
there's
anything
true
about
the
common
law
system
of
the
jury
that
was
not
the
common
law
of
jury.
the
jury
can
do
what
it
pleases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you're
qualified
under
the
state
of
jury
in
the
criminal
case
can
do
what
it
please
and
nobody
can
call
it
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point
we've
been
saying
that
if
say
that
you
notice,
we
brought
here
for
this
event
--
the
only
way
counsel
has
to
knowing
what
the
had
brought
the
case
here
for
is
what
the
customs
presented
which
is
(inaudible)
granted
denying
the
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
good
reason
or
another
difficulty
as
i
understand
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
knows
--
he
knows
what
(inaudible)
by
his
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
i
understood
the
purport
of
justice
clark's
question,
did
you
understood
the
difference
the
way
i
do.
i
got
--
i
understood
his
question
here.
assuming
that
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
of
certiorari,
do
not
raise
a
particular
question
as
to
my
relief,
that
is
a
here
and
concentrate
questions
presented
one
and
two
--
they
present
one
and
two
and
not
three
with
different
purchase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understand
the
purport
of
justice
clark's
question
assuming
that
that
is
so
made
this
court
of
its
own
motion
note
an
obvious
error
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
tasked
to
review
and
which
was
sell
the
goods
sustained
on
the
issues
amended
but
which
also
has
an
--
an
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
error
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
happen
to
arrive
--
that's
not
--
that's
--
that
question
arise
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
here
in
a
situation
which
we're
not
dealing
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
should
say
the
subject
to
correction
or
i
should
be
deprived
if
i
will
so
i
should
be
deprive
if
i
would
adjust
the
correction.
in
this
instance,
i
should
think
that
it
was
a
possible
error
in
a
judgment
which
you're
asked
to
affirm
this
court
would
have
power
to
sustain
immediate
grounds
of
judgment
would
have
the
advice
even
though
counsel
for
petitioner
would
grant
sufficient
reason
of
its
own
isn't
right
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
we
have
--
i
suppose
the
reason
that
counsel
has
to
put
questions
presented
is
to
make
us
determine
whether
the
question
is
wording
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
acceptance
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
provision
ought
to
interfere
considering
the
fact
that
that
amendment
derive
from
the
court's
own
suggestion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
make
a
qualification
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
id
like
to
make
a
qualification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
he
himself
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
while
the
review
was
not
exercised,
it
was
constantly
being
said
because
of
the
discretion
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he's
right
about
that
and
he
doesn't
have
to
set
out
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
alderman,
i
don't
like
to
take
much
of
your
client
but
perhaps
you
can
dispose
of
this
(inaudible)
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
original
three
courts,
the
district
court,
the
circuit
court,
and
this
court
in
cases
of
controversies
between
states
or
might
by
trial
court,
the
courts
originating
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
well
as
the
circuit
court,
and
this
court,
and
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
with
section
17
exhausted
from
(inaudible)
if
that
is
a
continued
way
of
saying
that
in
all
the
said
courts
of
united
states,
before
which
they
are
making
a
trial
(inaudible)
circuit
court
and
the
three
courts
of
united
states,
all
cases
in
which
they
have
original
trial
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
not
way
of
putting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
this
court
has
denied
a
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
alderman,
can
you
accomplish
something
even
if
you're
off
to
something
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
maybe,
if
his
question
was,
is
the
figure
--
if
the
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
that's
suggested
by
the
district
court
was
it
abuse
of
discretion?
is
that
not
in
itself
a
reviewing
question
if
properly
presented
by
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
good
question,
will
it
--
on
this
petition
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
should
think
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
maybe
some
other
will
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
foreclose
not
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
whether
this
court
is
foreclosed
by
the
determination
of
a
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
damage
in
the
district
court
is
excessive.
the
answer
to
that
clearly
is
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
perfectly
clarified
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
merely
a
case
that
you
mentioned,
140
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
you
--
why
did
you
formulate
questions
presented
if
all
counsel
has
to
do
is
talking
it
loud
and
argue
matters
with
the
sustaining
questions
presented.
why
did
you
take
questions
presented,
because
the
rules
require
the
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
rule
state
specifically,
rule
22,
the
only
reason
to
(inaudible)
stating
the
questions
presented
for
review
expresses
and
determines
the
circumstance
in
this
case
and
set
forth,
and
only
to
questions
set
forth
for
the
petition,
barely
supplies
it
when
it
is
considered
by
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
you've
stated.
you
stated
that
the
court
didn't
have
power
to
touch
the
remittitur.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
any
kind
of
a
case?
why
anymore
in
this
case
or
in
a
contract
case,
or
a
coalition
case,
or
a
libel
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
would
be
to
indicate
what
--
by
justice
burton.
that
would
be
true
in
any
case,
and
there's
no
power
where
it's
difficult
to
fix
money
damage
to
consequences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(voice
overlap)
should
decide
in
federal
employers'
liability,
that's
in
a
coalition
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
be
difficult,
to
say
clearly,
in
any
event,
$50,000
is
not
accepted
and
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
have
touched
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
(voice
overlap)
but
we
have
the
rule
that
we
have
that
counsel
can
state
a
specific
question.
