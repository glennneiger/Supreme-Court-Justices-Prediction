that's
on
5%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
--
is
that
the
experience,
5%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
of
appeals,
take
into
account
at
all
that
a
22-year
old
man
was
elected
to
increases
his
earnings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
life
expectancy
or
the
life
expectancy
of
his
mother?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
--
what
was
that
expectancy?
do
you
recall?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
do
look
into
the
matter
at
all
as
to
the
question
of
mr.
chief
justice
has
mentioned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
we'd
be
compelled
to
consider
that
the
jury
or
the
court
would
have
a
right
to
refer
that
a
22-year
old
man
was
elected
to
make
more
as
he
went
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
didn't
do
that
as
i
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
date
on
that
in
connection
with
how
much,
he
would
like
to
be
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
he
--
he
argued
it,
didn't
he?
he
just
didn't
put
it
in
his
questions
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
to
that
time,
had
--
had
this
court
ever
held
that
if
appellate
court
could
do
what
the
court
did
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
refused
to
join
up
to
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
followed
that
practice
they
just
never
have
done
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
never
have
done
exactly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
another,
they
have
just
not
done
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
alderman
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
been
practicing
in
the
fourth
circuit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
number
of
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
know
that.
i
am
wondering
if
you
know
when
was
the
first
time
the
court
of
appeals
undertook
to
set
aside
judgments
of
the
trial
court
reversing,
or
setting
aside
the
jury
of
verdict.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
ask
--
i
ask
you
that
because
i
haven't
had
a
good
many
cases
whether
it
had
been
set
aside
both
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
federal
court
in
my
circuit
when
i
was
practicing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
at
that
time,
that
ended.
and
has
it
been
ending
it
down
in
your
circuit
up
to
1948?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
comparatively
new
so
far
as
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
history
of
the
judicial
process
in
the
country
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'll
--
you'll
think
about
that
next
time.
