mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
took
this
case
on
a
certiorari
to
determine
whether
$50,000
should
be
paid
by
the
respondent,
the
petitioner
in
this
unfortunate
case
or
whether
in
some
lesser
amount
should
be
paid.
there's
a
fix
data
in
this
case,
all
courts
below
held
and
nobody
challenges
that
holding
that
a
verdict
of
$60,000
on
the
facts
in
this
case
were
the
excess
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
trial
judge
stated
that
he
would
set
aside
the
verdict
unless
the
plaintiff
would
grant
or
file
a
remittitur
in
the
amount
of
$10,000
refusing
the
jury
verdict
from
$60,000
to
$50,000.
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
take
some
exception
to
the
statement
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
below,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
disclaimed
that
it
was
substituting
it's
judgment
on
any
question
of
fact
for
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
it
held
and
reversed
the
trial
court
in
terms
for
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
justice
reed
mentioned
a
question
about
the
mathematics,
which
indicates
what
the
court
below
has
said
about
the
evidence
in
this
case
had
been
read.
without
reading
extensively
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
it
showed
from
the
record
in
the
case
that
$50,000
put
out
prevailing
rates
of
interest
would
have
produced
for
the
beneficiaries
here
more
than
the
take
home
pay
of
this
young
man
so
long
as
he
work
for
his
family.
the
fourth
circuit
does
not
make
any
habit
of
reviewing
quantum
of
damages.
in
all
of
its
latest
series
of
cases,
it
has
held
that
automatically,
in
any
ordinary
case,
such
question
of
excessiveness
is
exclusively
a
question
for
the
district
court,
the
trial
court.
and
the
only
exception
which
it
--
it
makes
is
that
in
case
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
as
where
nothing
in
the
record
could
reasonably
justify
that
amount
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
only
in
the
case
of
what
it
cause,
a
very
rare
instance
of
abuse
of
discretion
does
it
under
to
review
that
question
at
all.
in
that
respect,
the
fourth
circuit
is
in
complete
harmony
with
the
ninth
circuit
and
so
far
as
i
can
read
the
cases,
it's
in
complete
harmony
with
what
of
all
there
the
circuit
say.
and
the
last
point
in
my
brief,
you
will
find
to
be
a
complete
review
of
the
decisions
of
the
different
circuits
since
fairmont
glass
works
case
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1933.
there
has
been
a
complete
shift
in
the
authorities
as
declared
by
the
courts
of
appeal
since
1936
and
not
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
as
i
read
their
decisions
denies
for
a
moment
that
it
has
power
to
review
a
trial
court
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
for
abuse
of
discretion.
the
very
question
which
was
pre-committed
by
this
court
in
the
fairmount
case
in
which
mr.
justice
brandies
was
so
careful
to
pre-commit
and
not
to
decide
for
causing
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
even
planned
that
the
trial
court
had
abused
it's
discretion
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
in
the
way
of
the
statement
by
the
trial
court
as
to
why
he
acted
as
he
did.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
make
pain
and
suffering
by
mathematics.
that
element
is
not
(voice
overlap)
here.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
it
might
be.
i
don't
think
even
in
that
case
that
the
sky
would
be
the
limit
for
a
jury
all
for
the
discretion
of
a
district
judge.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
you're
being
asked
to
do
it
solely
on
the
ground
of
absolute
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
of
that
question.
the
merits
of
the
--
of
a
--
the
court
of
appeals
decision
are
not
even
raised
broad
here
by
the
writ
of
certiorari.
the
only
questions
brought
are
the
questions
of
appellate
jurisdiction
and
power
which
i'll
shall
come
to
after
the
recess.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
excuse
me.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
sir.
i
have
read
from
the
rule
that
counsel
would
watch
the
clock
themselves
and
now
that
these
questions
to
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
over
--
over
spoke
what
i
said.
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
this
case
followed
a
recent
case,
which
it
decided
in
1948.
virginian
railway
company
against
armentrout
quoted
from
its
decision
in
that
case
and
that
--
rather
than
raising
a
purely
hypothetical
instance
of
what
might
happen
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
referring
to
the
decision
itself
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
on
my
brief,
the
gray
brief,
pages
8
to
15.
i
admitted
very
careful,
restatements
of
the
case
and
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below
with
pertinent
quotations
beginning
at
page
11,
and
on
page
12,
from
the
court's
language
in
this
case.
in
the
first
quoted
paragraph,
it
will
be
observed
that
the
court
did
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
as
to
what
precise
amount
of
damages
were
justifiable
in
this
case.
the
district
court
said
60
was
excessive,
50
was
all
right.
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
the
evidence
in
the
case,
they
admitted
the
evidence
as
to
contribution
the
actual
evidence,
and
it
dealt
with
what
in
railroad
rate
problems
as
often
referred
to
as
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
it
fixed
the
zone
of
reasonableness
for
the
damages
from
bottom
--
it
gets
$18,000
to
$19,000
and
top
brackets
which
it
describe
as
fantastic
on
the
evidence
of
$38,000
to
$39,000.
leaving
it
for
a
subsequent
jury
trial
to
fix
something
reasonable
in
that
zone
of
reasonableness.
far
from
denying
to
this
plaintiff
a
jury
trial,
the
court
dealt
liability
issues
as
well
as
damage
issues.
both
courts
held
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
to
find
the
liability.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
for
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
damages
alone,
the
most
perfect
situation
in
which
a
plaintiff
in
a
damage
suit
can
be
whether
defendant
has
no
defense
on
negligence
or
liability.
as
a
frightful
matter,
if
this
court
affirms
the
court
below,
that's
what
will
happen.
plaintiff
will
have
a
new
jury
trial
under
those
favorable
circumstances
on
damages
alone.
maybe
he
has
new
evidence,
i
don't
know.
the
other
alternative,
if
this
court
should
hold,
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
most
serious
holding,
that
is
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction
or
power
in
the
federal
judiciary
system.
to
review
a
judge
for
abusive
discretion,
a
trial
judge
on
the
matter
of
this
kind,
but
then
this
court
would
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
it
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
sir?
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
the
phrase
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
used,
and
i
was
leading
up
to
inviting
you
to
the
language
of
that
court
in
the
middle
of
page
12
as
quoted
in
my
brief.
its
ultimate
conclusion
was
a
total
contribution
of
$50,000
by
young
neese
to
his
parents.
and
he
and
they
lived
out
there
with
normal
expectancy,
seems
to
us
far
beyond
the
pale
of
any
reasonable
probability
and
entirely
without
support
in
the
record.
then
he
cited
cases
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit,
from
other
circuits
and
particularly
the
1948
decision
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
this
same
court
in
the
virginian
railway
against
armentrout.
and
the
--
and
the
court
quoted
from
the
armentrout
case
this
language,
which
is
its
statement
of
what
it
understands
the
law
to
be
and
the
law
as
it
applies
perhaps.
much
more
better
than
the
argument
act
it
made.
the
court
of
appeals
below
said,
ordinarily,
of
course,
the
amount
of
damages
is
for
the
jury,
and
whether
a
verdict
should
be
set
aside
as
excessive
is
a
matter
resting
into
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
this,
however,
is
not
an
arbitrary
but
a
sound
discretion
to
be
exercised
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
the
case
and
within
the
limits
prescribed
by
reasoning
and
experience.
and
where
a
verdict
is
so
excessive,
that
it
cannot
be
justified
by
anything
in
the
record.
all
of
which
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
judge,
that
is
the
trial
judge,
to
set
is
aside,
failure
to
do
so
is
an
abusive
discretion
analogous
to
error
of
law
and
as
such
reviewable
on
appeal.
now
that's
the
very
question
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
to
this
court
pre-committed
and
reserve
for
future
decision
in
paramount
glassworks
case,
and
i
remind
the
court
that
that
case
was
decided
in
1933,
i
will
come
to
hit
its
historical
setting
in
a
moment.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
the
highest
contribution,
that
the
plaintiffs
--
that
the
beneficiaries,
the
plaintiff's
beneficiaries
contented
had
ever
been
made
to
them
by
the
sum
of
$75
just
before
he
died
and
at
other
terms
from
$30
to
$45
a
month.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
sir.
undoubtedly,
this
was
a
good
boy
and
a
good
son,
and
he
was
generally
(inaudible)
disposed
to
his
parents.
there
are
certain
undisputed
facts
in
the
case
however,
summarized
on
page
9
of
my
brief.
he
had
worked
for
the
respondent
as
a
crime
inspector
for
3
years
and
15
days.
during
his
time,
his
total
take
home
pay
was
$6544.79.
an
average
of
slightly
under
$2181
a
year.
of
that
total
of
$6544
he
had
actually
save
for
himself
not
to
use
it
upon
himself
and
not
contributed
to
anyone
its
total
of
$4984
on
the
building
and
loan
account.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
true
sir,
but
he
was
a
man
of
age,
single,
no
children,
no
dependents,
it
isn't
contented
with
his
parents
were
determined
and
he
boarded
and
roomed
with
his
parents.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
paid
them
anything
for
board
or
room,
and
of
course,
if
the
father
needed
a
paycheck,
he
would
be
glad
to
turn
it
over
to
him.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
think
its
--
it
isn't
necessarily
limited
it
to
the
amount
he
actually
contributed.
it's
a
reasonable
inference
to
be
drawn
from
all
of
the
evidence
as
to
what
pecuniary
laws
these
nondependent
parents
sustained.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that
is
what
reasonable
contributions
they
might
have
anticipated
from
this
young
man.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
think
the
court
took
that
all
into
consideration
because
it
commented
on
it
in
the
earlier
part
of
its
opinion.
i
haven't
undertaken
to
quote
that
full
opinion
here.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
it's
in
the
earlier
discussion
before
the
part
of
the
opinion
below,
which
i
am
--
the
entire
opinion
starts
at
page
45
of
the
record
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
--
and
ends
at
page
51.
at
the
first
beginning
paragraph
on
page
49,
that
evidence
is
discussed,
the
parents
of
neese
testified
that
he
always
give
his
full
paycheck
to
daddy
and
told
him
to
use
it
as
he
please
and
so
on.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
i
think
it's
based
on
the
study
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
particularly
the
evidence
as
to
actual
contributions
and
as
to
the
savings
of
the
young
man
and
so
forth.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
below
set
alone
any
$100
a
month
as
i
say.
they
undertook
to
estimate
its
own
reasonableness
for
--
remember
this
is
a
cash
payment
now
which
will
draw
an
income
in
the
future
which
the
court
of
appeals
below
said
would
range
from
$18,000
or
$19,000
at
the
bottom
up
to
$38,000
--
$37,000
or
$38,000
at
the
top.
it
was
putting
a
legal
judgment
on
what
reasonably
could
be
produced
as
damages
from
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
as
i
understand
it.
now
moreover,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
of
whether
that
was
a
correct
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
not
here
on
this
writ
of
certiorari.
it
was
not
presented
as
a
question
presented
on
the
petition.
in
other
words,
the
merits
of
that
decision
are
not
held.
the
sole
question
was
presented
or
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdictional
power
to
pass
on
that
question
at
the
review
of
the
district
judge's
upon
it.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
and
that
was
much
more
than
the
young
men
had
ever
made.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
sir?
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
the
court
of
appeals
below
dealt
with
5%,
4%
and
2.5%.
that
is
quite
(voice
overlap)
wide
derogation
in
his
own
reasonableness.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
the
district
court
made
no
announcement
whatsoever
as
to
the
grounds
upon
which
he
made
his
decision
except
to
say
that
the
verdict
was
excessive,
but
he
didn't
he
feel
that
it
was
the
result
of
ramification
of
prejudice
and
he
would
set
it
aside
unless
the
plaintiff
would
follow
--
in
other
words,
he
fixed
out
of
the
area
$10,000.
and
he
made
no
statement
to
show
the
basis
of
the
remittitur
which
he
suggested
a
thing
which
on
the
face
of
it,
it
seems
to
me,
indicates
if
you
are
the
person
law
or
arbitrary
of
judgment.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
47.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
don't
make
comment
on
that,
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
life
expectancy
of
his
mother
is
stated
by
the
--
mrs.
neese's
life
was
used
because
she
is
the
younger
parent
and
she's
expected
to
live
longer.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
i
thought
it
was
stated
by
the
court
of
the
appeals
that
is
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
--
i
think
but
there
but
let's
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
why
i
started
out,
mr.
justice,
by
saying,
“i
did
not
think
this
court
thought
this
case
here
on
certiorari
merely
itself
to
review
the
evidence
and
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
right,
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
--
that's
what
his
father
was
receiving
at
60
and
he
also
was
a
car
inspector
that
they're
in
the
same
position.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
certainly
--
certainly
think
they
considered
it
in
that
connection.
now
i
want
to
say
to
the
court
that
i
am
not
--
particularly
understood
in
this
case
in
the
amount
of
the
money
that
is
to
be
paid
to
petitioner.
we
earn
some
money
and
we
earn
a
fair
and
reasonable
amount.
but
what
concerns
me
in
this
case,
is,
what
i
think
would
be
done
to
the
few
administration
justice
in
the
federal
courts
appeal
to
what
should
hold
that
the
courts
of
appeals
of
the
united
states
are
entirely
without
jurisdictional
power
to
review
a
trial
judge
for
abusive
discretion
and
refusing
to
set
aside
the
verdict
as
excessive
or
as
inadequate.
that
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
would
say
that
$50,000
as
quickly
as
i
could
get
it
to
the
petitioner
with
interest
and
cost.
and
i
concede
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
make
that
kind
of
finding
if
it
wishes
to
review
the
evidence
in
this
case.
but
i
stil
insist
that
this
court
did
not
bring
this
case
here
for
that
purpose.
it
brought
it
here
to
decide
an
important
question
of
federal
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
to
resolve
what
is
at
least
a
verbal
conflict
between
the
different
circuits
on
that
question.
to
wit
the
very
question
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
so
carefully
saved
for
future
decision
in
the
paramount
glassworks
case.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
i'm
quite
willing
to
admit
that
there
maybe
a
debatable
quality
in
the
merits
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
one
court
might
look
at
one
way
and
one
another.
but
i
still
come
back
to
the
fact
that
your
writ
of
certiorari
did
not
bring
that
question
here.
and
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
exactly.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
not
at
all.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
he
confined
this
petition
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
he
--
he
confined
his
petition
for
certiorari
solely
to
the
appellate
jurisdictional
question.
now
he
could
easily
have
added
a
third
question
in
any
event
was
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
right
or
wrong.
and
if
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
without
confining
the
case
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
that
question
would
have
been
here
but
it
isn't
here.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
below?
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
no,
i'm
just
trying
to
show
you
what
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
simply
to
show
that
it
was
not
undertaking
to
pass
on
a
use
of
factual
question
but
on
a
question
of
law.
as
to
the
ultimate
reasonableness,
in
view
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
it
disclaimed
carefully
that
it
would
interfere
with
the
ordinary
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
as
to
the
quantum
of
a
verdict.
and
it
would
only
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
oh
yes
and
they're
setout
in
the
first
point
of
my
brief
beginning
at
page
20.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
court
does
not
bring
cases
of
this
character
here
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
the
evidence
below
in
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
courts
of
appeals
suppose
to
be
the
final
courts
on
questions
of
that
character
and
that
would
not
make
a
--
a
case
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that
was
the
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
necessary
in
undertaking
to
answer
the
petitioner's
petition
and
his
argument
to
answer
his
argument
and
most
of
his
argument
was
not
addressed
to
the
jurisdictional
problem
but
addressed
to
the
problem
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
below
made
a
correct
or
an
incorrect
decision.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
no
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
trying
to
made
at
that
stage.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
the
most
interesting
question,
mr.
justice
clark.
as
i
see
it,
the
controlling
jurisdictional
statutes
cover
this
court
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
don't
say
if
you
should
declare
that
the
courts
of
appeals
of
the
united
states
are
wholly
without
this
character
review
for
abuse
of
discretion,
that
you
would
leave
yourself
in
the
position
of
being
also
unable
to
make
such
a
review.
now,
i
was
somewhat
tried
it
but
i
cannot
say
for
the
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
thats
right.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
understand
sir
--
i
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
thought
i
had
to
answer
that
question
before
it
was
asked.
i
said
i
didn't
at
all
challenge
the
power
of
this
court
to
do
that.
it
would
be
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
quite
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
quite
right.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well
i
agree
to
that,
yes,
of
course.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
he
didn't
put
in
this
questions
presented,
that's
quite
right.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
what
you
have
said
constantly
in
your
decision.
i
started
to
say
and
my
time
is
rightly
elapsing,
that
i
was
somewhat
shaded
apparently
with
over
frankness
and
the
second
point
of
my
argument
beginning
at
page
22
of
my
brief,
until
the
partition
that
this
court
not
to
be
just
as
entirely
frank
as
i
know
how
to
be.
undoubtedly,
the
long
list
of
cases
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
put
in
his
footnotes
in
fairmount,
as
of
1933,
constituted
an
overwhelming
weight
of
authority
against
my
position
in
this
case
as
of
that
date.
i
have
read
and
studied
and
analyzed
all
of
those
old
cases.
i
made
a
careful
study
on
the
earlier
cases
where
the
rule
first
began
to
be
expressed
and
i
am
convinced,
that
the
rule
had
this
entire
basic
foundation
on
this
procedural
limitation
of
writ
of
error,
which
had
gone
--
couldn't
bring
up
at
all
to
an
appellate
court
any
question
about
a
motion
of
the
new
trial
--
for
new
trial
of
the
overruling
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
i
--
i
have
no
time
to
review
those
cases
but
i
think
if
you
understood
to
look
at
the
analysis
of
them
on
the
brief,
in
four
or
five
of
the
very
earliest
of
those
cases,
this
court
simply
said
that
we
cannot
review
this
question
on
writ
of
error.
that
was
repeated
time
after
time
and
then
as
the
old
cases
so
frequently
did,
they
took
a
step
farther,
went
through
a
transition.
gradually,
the
statement
began
to
be
changed
into
a
statement
of
the
rule
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
it
has
been
repeated
so
often
that
the
court
just
got,
i
think,
in
the
habit
of
saying
we
don't
review
this
kind
of
question.
the
first
case
in
which
it
got
around
to
that
was
in
the
late
part
of
the
last
century,
kerr
against
clampitt
95
u.s.188,
cited
on
page
46
of
my
brief
in
1877.
there
we
did
and
it's
the
first
case
i
can
find
where
this
court
stated
it
as
--
has
a
rule
of
no
jurisdiction
but
then
it
went
on
in
the
passage
i've
quoted
and
carefully
showed
the
origin
of
it
in
this
common
law
of
limitation
on
the
writ
of
error
that
the
court
could
not
look
into
a
thing
because
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
record.
now
i
do,
of
course,
admit
that
state
of
decision
shown
in
the
footnotes
in
the
fairmount
glass
works
case
in
1933.
i
have
a
historical
discussion
in
my
brief
which
i
won't
have
time
to
review
here.
tracing
the
changes
in
the
judicial
code
from
the
original
act
of
1789
down
to
the
act
of
1948,
which
rewrote
to
recodified
and
enacted
into
positive
law
the
judicial
code
as
title
28,
united
states
code,
(inaudible)
1952
edition.
in
1928,
congress
took
the
two
first
batch
at
abolishing
the
common
law,
the
writ
of
error,
and
its
technicalities.
they
didn't
complete
that
job.
they
didn't
go
back
and
repeal
inconsistent
laws,
and
put
it
in
final
shape
until
in
the
recodifying
act
of
1948.
the
fairmount
case
was
decided
in
1933,
14
and
some
years
before
the
recodifying
act,
but
five
years
after
the
first
two
batch
that
congress
took
at
abolishing
the
old
common
law
writ
of
error.
and
such
was
the
acuteness
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
writing
for
this
court
that
he,
knowing
what
congress
had
done
in
1928
was
careful
in
that
decision
to
show
that
the
abolition
of
the
writ
of
error
had
abolished
that
whole
basis
for
the
old
rule
against
jurisdiction.
he,
of
course,
could
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen
14
years
later
in
1948.
but
he
saw
that
congress
in
terms
had
abolished
common
law
writ
of
error.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
certainly.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
up
until
that
time,
i
don't
--
don't
think
it
is
--
or
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
brandeis,
as
set
out
in
the
footnotes
in
that
case
so
far
as
i
can
find
is
absolutely
accurate
and
as
i
say
on
the
brief
at
that
date,
1933,
cobb
against
lepisto
in
the
ninth
circuit
stood
in
splendid
isolation
as
the
only
case
of
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
there
could
be
this
kind
of
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
now
far
from
that
being
the
situation
today,
the
last
part
of
my
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
sir?
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
a
matter
of
polity,
he
said.
he
did
not
say
no
to
jurisdiction.
he
said
this
court
has
followed
that
polity
and
also
have
the
courts
of
appeals
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
polity
he
said
and
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
right.
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
as
--
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
not
on
any
holding
of
one
of
the
constitutional
statutory
jurisdiction.
now
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
it's
highly
significant
also
and
i
don't
want
to
be
overtaking
to
look
about
the
questions
that
petitioner
presented
but
the
rules
of
this
court
also
require
that
he
should
set
out
the
statutes
involved
in
this
case.
he
said
that
most
statutes
whatsoever,
either
on
petition
or
on
brief
though
he
does
quote
the
seventh
amendment
as
being
involved.
petitioner
and
all
of
his
documents
just
(inaudible)
all
statutes
aside
and
argues
that
for
the
court
to
exercise
the
power
which
it
exercise
would
violate
the
seventh
amendment
and
would
be
unconstitutional.
he
didn't
present
a
constitutional
question
among
his
questions.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
quite
right.
i
suppose
--
but
i
do
set
out
the
statutes
and
i'd
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
them
on
page
2
of
my
brief.
first,
all
the
three
come
from
the
recodifying
act
of
1948.
the
first
one,
section
23
of
the
act
of
june
25,
1948,
was
the
final
step
in
abolishing
common
law
writ
of
error.
all
acts
of
congress
referring
to
writs
of
error
shall
be
construed
as
amended
to
the
extent,
i
say,
it's
a
substitute
appeal
for
writ
of
error.
now
the
two
jurisdictional
statutes
follow.
section
1291
is
this.
it's
now
1291
of
the
united
states
code,
title
28,
1952
edition.
the
courts
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
appeals
from
all
final
decisions
of
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
except
for
a
direct
appeal
maybe
heading
in
the
supreme
court.
now
that's
a
jurisdictional
statute.
this
was
a
final
judgment.
it's
certainly
was
not
one
from
which
a
direct
appeal
could
come
to
this
court.
now
most
significantly,
even
this
thing,
section
2106,
which
is
the
--
the
controlling
statute
now,
which
was
not
in
existence
in
1933.
the
supreme
court
or
any
other
court
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
may
affirm,
modify,
vacate,
set
aside,
or
reverse
any
judgment,
decree
or
order
of
a
court
lawfully
brought
before
it
for
review
and
may
remand
the
cause
and
direct
the
entry
of
such
appropriate
judgment,
decree,
or
order,
or
require
such
further
proceedings
to
be
had
as
maybe
just
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
set
those
out
fully
in
my
brief.
they
showed
that
certain
of
the
old
provisions
were
appealed
as
obsolete.
the
old
provision
of
section
22
of
the
original
judiciary
act
forbidding
reversal
from
error
in
fact
was
repealed
in
1948.
but
i
do
want
to
call
your
attention
to
this
fact
in
connection
with
my
historical
discussion
and
i
haven't
had
time
to
go
into.
september
24
and
25,
1789
or
perhaps
two
of
the
most
significant
days
in
our
history.
the
first
congress
--
first
session
at
that
time
was
dealing
with
two
documents
of
the
greatest
importance.
first
was
the
judiciary
act
which
established
the
federal
judiciary
and
regulate.
the
other
was
12
proposed
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
judiciary
act
and
the
proposed
amendments
went
through
the
legislative
history
of
that
congress
almost
hand
in
hand.
they
were
considered
in
the
light
of
each
other.
there
were
two
views
in
that
congress.
one
was
that
the
judiciary
act
should
be
affixed
first
and
then
the
amendments
passed
upon
in
the
light
of
the
judiciary
act.
others
thought
vice
versa,
but
they
did
go
hand
in
hand
and
that
was
the
most
extraordinary
effort
that's
harmonizing
the
judiciary
act
and
the
proposed
amendment.
you
recall
that
the
first
two
of
12
proposed
amendments
whenever
ratified
by
the
states
so
they
became
the
first
10
amendments
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
proposed
amendment
nine
became
amendment
seven.
now
that
very
congress
in
that
very
judiciary
act
while
they
put
in
section
22
which
is
common
on
--
on
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
fairmount,
also
carried
sections
17
--
section
17
i've
quoted
on
page
38
of
my
brief.
and
i
think
it's
a
profound
significance.
the
courts
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
appeals
--
oh
i'm
sorry.
i
picked
up
the
wrong
words.
oh,
page
34
of
my
brief.
section
17
of
the
original
judiciary
act
provided
this.
that
all
of
the
said
courts
of
the
united
states,
district
court,
circuit
courts,
and
this
court,
appellate
courts
and
trial
courts,
that
all
of
the
said
courts
of
united
states
shall
have
power
to
grant
new
trials
in
cases
where
there
has
been
a
trial
by
jury
for
reasons
for
which
new
trials
have
used
it
and
granted
in
the
courts
of
law.
now
at
that
point
on
page
34
of
my
brief
is
the
defect
in
my
research.
i
said
that
that
language
remand
the
same
except
for
a
comma
that
was
properly
put
in
by
the
act
of
1911.
i
was
wrong
about
the
comma
was
put
in.
the
phrase
was
properly
punctuated
by
revised
statutes
section
726
of
1878
and
then
the
act
--
the
act
of
1911
added
that
second
summons
quoted
on
the
middle
of
my
page.
another
defect
and
a
more
serious
one
in
the
research
set
out
on
my
brief
is
that
i
should
have
shown
how
long
these
two
provisions,
section
17
and
section
22
of
the
original
judiciary
act,
remained
hand
in
hand
in
the
judicial
code.
they
remained
there
together
until
1948
under
when
reversal
was
passed.
no
member
of
that
original
congress
so
far
as
the
debate
show
as
shown
by
charles
warren
his
famous
article
“new
light
on
the
history
of
the
judiciary
act”,
which
upon
which
this
court
based
its
decision
in
erie
railroad
against
tompkins,
overruling
swift
against
tyson.
this
article
takes
up
to
debate
section
by
section,
and
it
discloses
that
there
was
no
debate
whatsoever
about
this
section
17.
everybody
agreed
that
the
courts
of
appeals
like
the
district
courts
or
trial
courts
should
have
the
power
to
grant
throughout
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
--
then
circuit
courts,
and
this
court.
and
there
was
no
debate
about
it.
that
original
congress
saw
no
conflict
between
the
provision
of
section
22
and
the
provision
of
section
17.
one
was
dealing
with
the
question
of
law.
the
other
was
dealing
with
the
matter
in
fact
as
the
old
language
had
it.
but
one
article
clearly
discloses
that
the
purpose
of
section
22
in
the
original
act
was
identical
with
the
purpose
of
the
seventh
amendment,
merely,
to
prevent
the
courts
of
appeals
from
ruling
or
reversing
on
pure
questions
of
fact
as
distinguished
from
questions
of
law
or
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact.
or,
not
only
was
i
think
those
two
documents,
the
first
judiciary
act
and
the
first
ten
amendments
or
the
--
proposed
first
twelve
passed
by
the
same
congress
constitute
probably
the
most
extraordinary
mutual
contemporaneous
practical
construction
of
each
other
by
two
documents
in
all
history
that
i
know
of.
not
only
does
it
clearly
appear
that
there
was
no
conflict
between
section
17
and
22
in
the
most
rabid
anti-federalist
never
raised
his
voice
against
section
17
declaring
that
all
of
the
said
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
power
to
grant
a
new
trial.
but
congress
evidently
saw
no
conflict
between
the
two
and
both
of
them
remained
in
the
judicial
code
until
1948.
and
i
do
think
that
that's
a
considerable
significance
as
bearing
on
the
historical
problem.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
only
where
they're
sitting
(inaudible)
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that
maybe
one
construction
that
might
be
put
on
it
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
they're
not
a
way
of
putting
it
on
our
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
i
have
found
nothing
in
the
books
that
would
indicate
any
such
purpose,
any
such
construction
to
be
put
on
section
17.
now
--
if
i
may
like
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
he
might
argue
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
a
trial
that
was
granted
at
the
common
law.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
now
i
think
the
--
of
course,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
the
--
the
constitutional
problem
while
it
lurks
in
this
case
is
here.
if
congress
hasn't
got
the
constitution
filed
to
confer
this
jurisdiction
on
the
courts
of
appeals
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
he
can't
do
it
and
you
can't
construe
the
sections
which
i
have
referred
to
as
conferring
about
it.
i
based
my
argument
on
the
constitutional
point
squarely
on
galloway
against
united
states,
the
most
recent
case
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
seventh
amendment
problem.
in
that
case
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
writing
for
this
court,
absolutely
fairly
assimilated
as
raising
exactly
equivalent
questions
of
law
subject
to
appellate
review
that
the
merit
of
the
evidence
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict
for
a
new
trial
and
motion
for
direction
of
verdict
and
one
other
as
raising
exactly
equivalent
questions
of
law.
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
inconsistency
between
an
appellate
court
dealing
with
that
kind
of
question
of
law
in
the
seventh
amendment.
and
throughout
that
case,
depending
of
this
court
stresses
the
fact
that's
led
the
practice
applies
to
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
set
aside
the
verdict
and
for
new
trial
equally
with
direction
of
verdict
for
one
of
the
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
a
verdict
and
they
all
(inaudible)
to
the
evidence.
i
take
a
careful
consideration
of
that
case
in
the
light
of
this
case
will
answer
any
constitution
problem.
i
think
it
all
really
comes
down
to
one
thing.
what
is
the
question
of
law
and
what
is
what
counsel
referred
to
as
a
factual
question?
or,
what
is
a
pure
question
of
fact?
i
don't
know
of
any
questions
of
law
that
arise
except
directly
or
indirectly
out
of
factual
situation.
if
that
were
not
true,
there
would
be
very
little
for
this
court
or
any
other
appellate
court
to
decide
these
questions
of
law
if
you
could
not
deal
with
a
question
which
directly
or
indirectly
proceeds
from
factual
considerations.
but
in
my
opinion
for
a
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
review
and
reverse
a
district
trial
judge
for
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
ground
that
he
has
approved
the
verdict
and
refuse
to
set
it
aside
which
is
not
warranted
by
the
evidence
and
write
in
the
case
and
it's
beyond
the
bail
of
all
reasonableness
is
distinctly
a
question
of
law.
if
that'd
be
true
and
i
feel
that
it
is,
there's
no
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment
for
the
very
same
reason
that
there's
no
violation
of
--
even
the
original
provision
22
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
i
feel
that
the
decision
in
the
galloway
case
is
dispositive
of
this
case
on
both
questions.
the
constitutional
question
and
in
the
statutory
question
here.
and
i
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
and
this
--
that
this
court
certainly
should
not
hold
that
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
judiciary
to
review
a
trial
judge
for
abuse
of
discretion
on
a
question
of
criminal
verdict.
and
i
do
invite
your
consideration
of
my
review
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
of
all
of
the
circuits.
the
ten
circuits
and
the
circuit
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
have
been
handed
down
since
the
fairmount
case
in
1933,
which
is
the
last
point
in
my
brief.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
doubt
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
of
appeals
can
pick
out
one
figure
and
direct
the
district
court
what
judgment
he
must
approved
on
it,
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
this
from
a
legal
standpoint
and
estimated
the
evidence
to
find
a
range
of
reasons,
it
didn't
pick
out
a
particular
and
i
doubt
very
much
its
power
to
do
it.
it
reversed
the
district
court
and
sent
it
back
to
let
the
jury
do
that
under
proper
instructions
again
from
the
district
court.
well
now
some
of
the
circuit
courts,
forbids
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
the
fifth
circuit
has
done
that
in
several
cases.
they
have
added
an
additional
remittitur
to
their
remittitur
in
the
lower
court.
i'd
be
somewhat
dubious
about
defending
that.
but
merely
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
for
abusive
discretion
and
send
back
for
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
damages
alone,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
exceedingly
grave
for
this
court
to
hold
that
there
is
no
such
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
judiciary.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
i
think
that
puts
to
me
the
same
question
that
i
again
fail
to
answer.
i
think
this
court
has
the
power
to
do
what
it
wants
to
with
this
case.
it
can
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
on
the
whole
view
of
the
evidence.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
think
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
would
be
very
careful
to
present
the
question
of
the
merits
of
that
decision
to
this
court.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
know
that.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
think
any
--
any
decision
of
any
court
can
conceivably
be
ridiculous.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
and
erroneous
for
that
reason.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i'm
certain
it
would
not
say
so.
i
think
on
all
the
evidence
in
this
case,
$50,000
was
excessive,
but
i
can't
undertake
to
settle
the
figure
with
--
this
court
unless
it
decides
me
to
do
so.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
think
it
was,
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
thought
it
was
conceivable
we
both
made
an
error.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
i
thank
you
mr.
justice.
i
didn't
intend
to.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
undoubtedly.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
undoubtedly.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
meant
to
say
that
--
that
in
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
right.
this
court
doesn't
--
doesn't
ordinarily
take
that
kind
of
a
question
up
here
for
the
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
but
of
course
it
can
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
no,
no
no.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
don't
mean
--
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
if
i
took
that
position,
i
would
be
claiming
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
an
arbitrary
and
unrevealed
discretion,
just
as
my
brother
is
claiming
that
there
is
a
perfectly
arbitrary
absolute
and
unrevealed
discretion
opposed
in
the
district
court.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes
please,
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
my
own
circuit.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
i
think
virginian
railway
against
armentrout
was
the
first
case
in
which
it
actually
did
it.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that
was
1948
and
i
meant
to
comment
to
some
extent
on
that
case
because
that's
the
case
on
which
the
court
below
relied
in
our
case,
because
in
the
armentrout
case,
it
went
into
a
very
elaborate
discussion
of
this
rule
of
law
and
jurisdiction
question.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
well,
but
doing
the
decision
in
the
fairmount
case
in
1933
and
the
present,
i
know
of
no
such
case
that's
come
up
to
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
different
circuits
had
been
regularly
asserting
and
exercising
this
kind
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
virginian
railway
company
against
armentrout.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
s.
alderman
thank
you
very
much
sir.
