mr.
john
w.
inglish
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
discussion
that
has
been
going
on
most
recently
in
this
presentation
by
mr.
blackmar
i
think
really
gets
at
the
heart
of
the
issue,
which
i
believe
the
court
was
trying
to
cover
in
the
bates
case.
i
think
in
the
bates
case
that
what
the
court
was
saying
was,
we
believe
there
should
be
more
information
flowing
freely
and
cleanly
to
the
public
so
as
to
enable
the
public
to
have
a
more
intelligent
way
of
making
a
decision
in
the
selection
of
a
lawyer.
incident
to
that,
of
course,
was
this
lawyer's
first
amendment
right
to
speak,
which
is,
of
course,
present
in
any
commercial
speech
case.
i
think
what
the
court
has
to
do
is
weigh
these
rights
and
these
objectives
in
the
balance.
we
have
seen
that
following
bates,
a
number
of
courts
have
arrived
at
entirely
opposite
conclusions
as
to
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
this
balance.
that
is,
to
enable
the
lawyer
to
speak
freely,
so
that
the
public
will
be
more
informed,
which
it
must
be,
and
with
which
we
concur,
and
at
the
same
time
protect
the
public
from
potentially
misleading
or
deceptive
statements.
the
statement
with
regard
to
the
courts
in
which
the
lawyer
is
admitted,
i
think,
is
potentially
misleading.
i
think
that
information
is
of
value
to
other
lawyers,
and
it
is
published
in
professional
publications.
i
think
it
is
necessary
for
referral
work.
but
i
don't
believe--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
within
my
office,
i
think
that
is
entirely
appropriate.
i
have
others
there,
and
i
intend
to
put
this
one
there
when
i
get
back.
it
took
me
31
years
to
get
here,
and
i
value
the
experience,
but
i
don't
believe
that
is
quite
the
same--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--advertising,
yes,
but
i
think
it
means
advertising
in
the
yellow
pages,
to
the
public
generally.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
that,
your
honor,
and
the
client
who
comes
into
my
office.
he
is
already
there
for
some
purposes,
and
seeing
this
did
not
get
him
there.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
there
is
some
admiralty
practice
in
st.
louis,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
i
understand
that
there
are.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
under
admiralty,
i
don't
recall
that
they
are.
i
thought
there
was
a
rule
broad
enough
to
encompass
that.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
patent?
i
thought--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--the
admiralty,
patent,
and...
were
permitted,
i
think,
in
another
rule.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
i
think...
well,
at
another
place
in
this
rule.
i
think
that
the
exception...
i
believe.
i
may
be
mistaken,
your
honor,
but
i
know
that...
and
i
did
not
particularly
look
at
it
with
regard
to
admiralty
or
patent.
a
great
many
states
have
accepted
that
as
a
traditional
specialty.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
i
don't
recall.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
no,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
frankly
concede
that
that
could
be
of
value
in
those
two
areas.
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about,
though,
is
the
blanket
advertising
of
courts
in
which
one
is
authorized
to
practice,
starting
from
this
court
and
going
on
down.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
on
the
letterhead?
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
it
would,
your
honor.
that
might
be
considered
as
advertising,
and
improper
advertising.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
is
potentially
misleading
in
that
it
could
convey
to
the
layman
that
this
lawyer
has
certain
expertise
that
the
other
lawyer
does
not
have,
and
being
admitted
to
this
court
i
don't
think
indicates
any
such
expertise,
nor
being
admitted
in,
for
example,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
or
various
other
places.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
could
have...
that
could
have
some
value
to
a
potential
client.
yes,
i
would
have
to
concede
that.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
we
are
dealing
with
that
plus
the
i
general
rule
that
the
state
has
prohibiting...
well,
actually
indirectly
prohibiting
the
listing
of
courts
in
which
you
are
authorized
to
practice,
because,
as
mr.
blackmar
has
stated,
the
rule
says
you
may
say
this
and
nothing
else,
and
it
is
not
one
of
those
things
authorized.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
could
be
useful
information.
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
have
to
concede
that.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
no.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
and
the
rule
expressly--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--yes,
sir.
and
the
rule
expressly
provides
for
that.
it
says
you
may
do
that.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
you
may
identify
yourself
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
does
happen.
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
the
best--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
w.
inglish
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
recognized
as
a
permissible
item
of
advertising,
i
suppose.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
your
honor,
that
has
been
changed
to
negligence.
it
started
out
as
tort
law,
and
somebody
suggested...
i
don't
know
how
it
happened...
to
the
court
that
maybe
a
better
word
would
be
negligence.
the
appellant
here
wanted
to
use
a
term,
and
did
use
"personal
injury".
now,
to
me,
the
word
"negligence".
i
don't
think
he
has
been
harmed
in
any
way,
because
i
think
he
can
include
in
his
advertisement
more
than
he
wanted
to
include.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
your
honor,
if
we
got
into
a
subjective
test
of
whether
or
not
this
appellant
has
the
expertise
to
hold
himself
out
as
practicing
law
in
the
area
of
personal
injury,
it
might
be
misleading,
but
that
would
be
a
subjective
test.
we
have
cited
the
case
of
zimmerman
in
new
york,
where,
as
i
understand
the
rule,
it
is
simply
that
you
can
advertise
anything
you
want
to
as
long
as
it
isn't
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive.
this
young
lawyer
put
his
name
under
each
of
the
categories
in
the
yellow
pages,
and
then
after
the
fact
the
disciplinary
body
said,
but
you
don't
have
enough
expertise
in
all
these
areas
to
hold
yourself
out
in
this.
therefore,
they
reprimanded
him,
disciplined
him.
if
i
might
just
a
moment
address
what
my
personal
thoughts
are
on
that
question,
i
think
again
that
what
this
court
is
seeking
to
do
is
to
provide
information
to
the
public
to
enable
it
more
intelligently
to
select
a
lawyer.
i
think
if
the
bar
is
at
fault,
it
is
in
the
fact
that
we
don't
have
specialization,
which
as
mr.
blackmar
says,
we
do
not
have
in
missouri.
a
great
many
states
do.
we
do
not...
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
specialties,
as
has
been
pointed
out
here,
in
admiralty.
there
are
a
great
many
in
mr.
blackmar's
city,
st.
louis,
who
do
nothing
but
medical
malpractice,
who
do
nothing
but
personal
injury
work,
who
do
nothing
but
workers'
compensation,
and
so
forth.
now,
i
think
it
is
inherently
misleading,
as
has
been
pointed
out
even
by
mr.
blackmar
and
in
the...
i
believe
maybe
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
that
when
you
say
i
practice
in
these
areas,
whatever
you
call
it,
whether
you
call
it
personal
injury,
or
worker's
compensation,
or
whatever
it
is,
and
then
at
the
bottom
say,
but
i
don't
hold
myself
out
as
having
any
expertise
therein,
you
have
confused,
at
least,
the
public,
because
i
thought
the
idea
was
that
we
were
to
assist
this
public
in
finding
a
lawyer
who
did
have
expertise.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
frankly,
if
i
were
drafting
the
rule,
i
would
opt
for
what
tennessee
did,
in
effect.
they
went
a
little
too
far,
because
they
wouldn't
even
permit
the
routine
matters
which
this
court
said
you
cannot
suppress,
of
the
simple
will,
the
uncontested
divorce,
and
so
forth.
but
what
i
would
do,
frankly,
if
i
were
drafting
the
rule,
which
i
think
would
be
less
misleading
to
the
public,
would
be
to
say,
you
may
advertise
the
availability
and
the
prices
of
these
routine
legal
services,
which
bates
said
you
could
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
court
was
quite
careful
to
make
it
clear
that
you
intended
to
limit
that
case
to
that
situation,
the
availability
and
prices
of
routine
legal
services,
list
them,
and
incidentally,
courts
differ
as
to
what
they
are.
iowa
has
one
list,
missouri
has
another.
but
nevertheless,
whatever
it
is.
and
then
say,
we
will
not
prohibit
lawyers...
i
mean,
we
will
not
permit
lawyers
to
hold
themselves
out
as
practicing
in
any
area
until
and
unless
we
do
have
specialization,
as
tennessee
did.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
yes.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
your
honor,
yes,
i
do
defend
the
rule.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
as
i
answered
justice
o'connor,
that
word
was
changed
to
negligence.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
well,
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
yes,
sir,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
well,
no.
that
is
true.
it
has
been
changed.
but
that
was
only
part
of--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
but
that
is
only
one
of
the
items,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
unfortunately,
justice
stevens,
the
court
below
did
not
tell
us
which
of
these
items
it
was
considering
as
violative
of
the
rules--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--they
certainly
did
not.
no,
sir,
your
honor.
they
just
said,
we
hold
our
rules
out,
but--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
is
true,
and
there
has
been
some
discussion
prior
to
this
concerning
the
fact
that
perhaps
you
could
do
it
on,
you
know,
reverse
on
various
bases.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
there
has
been
discussion
that
this
case
is
limited
to
the
facts
before
the
court,
but
so
was
bates,
and
i
have
a
very
strong
feeling
that
regardless
of
what
this
court
does,
whether
it
affirms
or
reverses,
or
reverses
and
remands,
its
opinion
is
going
to
receive
construction
which
is
going
to
be
hopefully
of
some
help
to
the
courts
that
are
faced
with
this
problem,
to
conform
with
bates,
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
engage
in
enough
discussion
that
regardless
of
what
it
does,
whether
it
affirms
or
reverses,
that
the
disciplinary
bodies,
the
bodies
having
jurisdictions
over
lawyers
in
the
various
states
would
have
a
better
idea
of
how
to
conform
with
bates
and
permit
advertising.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
your
honor,
it
would
constitute
dictum
to
an
extent...
but
i
know
this
court
is
aware,
we
have
made
it
aware
in
briefs,
certainly,
of
the
discrepancies
that
the
various
jurisdictions
have
concerning
their
feeling
about
what
they
may
do
and
must
do
and
cannot
do
following
bates.
the
court
has
been
made
aware
of
a
number
of
advertisements
that
have
appeared
by
lawyers.
for
example,
i
sent
in
the
time
magazine
one
showing
the
hearse
with
no
frill
wills,
$15.
i
don't
believe
honestly
that
that
is
what
this
court
intended
to
encourage.
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
enables
people
to
more
intelligently
select
a
lawyer.
mr.
blackmar
has
cited
the
work
by
lori
andrews
on
birth
of
a
salesman,
who
is
advocating
the
madison
avenue
type
of
approach,
and
there
also
she
has
a
number
of
commercials
that
are
shown
on
television,
radio,
newspapers,
which
have
been
approved
and
are
permitted,
for
example,
in
wisconsin,
because
apparently
that
state
feels
it
must
do
so,
must
permit
this
pursuant
to
bates.
therefore,
as
i
said
earlier,
regardless
of
what
this
court
does,
i
think
its
discussion,
dictum,
or
whatever
it
might
be
or
otherwise,
is
going
to
be
construed
as
some
guideline
to
the
other
courts.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
well,
you
are
right,
your
honor,
but
i
anticipate...
i
hope
that
the
decision
will
be
a
little
more
far-reaching
than
that,
and
be
construed
along
with
ohralik,
primus,
bates--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--and
in
this
case
i
would
certainly
hope
so.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
but,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
sole
test,
when
you
go
beyond
the
routine
legal
services.
as
i
understood
bates,
when
it
said
not
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive,
it
was
talking
about
routine
legal
services,
not
the
other
areas,
which
i
think
that
perhaps
missouri
and
other
states
have
gratuitously
gone
beyond
in
permitting
advertisement
of
other
areas
of
practice.
i
don't
believe
bates
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
you
may
advertise
anything
you
want
to
as
long
as
it
isn't
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive.
now,
some
states
have
such
a
rule
apparently
construing
this,
but
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
not
adopt
such
a
rule
or
enforce
such
a
rule
upon
the
states,
because
it
is
subjective
in
nature,
and
we
were
talking
about
prior
restraint
earlier
here.
to
me,
that
is
prior
restraint,
when
you
say
to
me,
you
go
ahead
and
say
whatever
you
want
to
and
i
will
tell
you
later
whether
it
is
all
right
or
not.
alabama
has
one.
you
may
say
what
you
want
to,
and
you
mail
it
in
within
three
days.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
well,
again,
then
you
leave
the
door
open,
because
if
you
are
going
to
authorize
a
listing
of
areas,
and
you
are
going
to
give
areas
of
practice,
somebody
is
always
going
to
take
issue
with
you
and
say,
well,
i
have
a
better
word.
i
think
personal
injury
is
better
than
negligence.
negligence
is
better
than
tort--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--no,
it
did
not.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
i
am
sorry.
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
yes,
sir.
i
can't
answer
the
question.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
no,
your
honor.
no,
i--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--well,
what
i
would
like
for
you
to
do
is
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
lower
court,
and
say
that
the
states--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
well,
i
say...
here
is
why.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
well,
on
the
basis
that
the
state
should
have
the
right
to
do
the
regulation
within
their
own
bodies,
and
within
their
own
territory.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
well,
only...
i
think
the
states
should
be
given
considerable
leeway.
sure,
i
think
if
this
court
finds
that
that
is
an
undue
infringement
upon
his
right
of
free
speech,
that
it
does
in
fact--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--well,
let's
see,
there
are...
how
many
lawyers
are
there?
mr.
john
w.
inglish
about
five
of
us,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
yes,
that
may
well
be.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that
is
true.
but
the
point
being
that
either
this
court
is
going
to
lay
down
some
rules,
or
you
are
going
to
let
the
states
do
it,
and
if
you
don't
let
the
states
do
it,
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
people
coming
back
up
here
and
saying...
or,
i
don't
know
what
the
states
will
do.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
if
this
court--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--no,
i
agree
with
that.
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
the
fact
that...
well,
if
the
suspension
would
be
lifted...
well,
you
are
saying--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--well,
was
your
question,
if
one
of
them
is
valid,
in
other
words,
they
properly
reprimanded
him
on
one--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--yes,
then
i
think
he
is
properly
reprimanded,
even
though
he
would--
mr.
john
w.
inglish
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
to
summarize
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
here
today,
with
regard
to
using
the
term
"tort
law",
i
would
not
certainly
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
trying
to
defend
that
as
a
better
term
than
some
other
term.
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
don't
think
it
is
well
understood,
but
i
don't
really
think
that
is
dispositive
of
the
issue
before
the
court.
a
great
many
states,
following
plan
a
of
the
american
bar,
now
permit
listing
of
areas
of
practice,
and
some
of
them
say
you
may
use
three
or
five
or
all,
whatever
it
is,
and
those...
the
nomenclature
differs.
now,
are
we
to
say,
or
is
this
court
going
to
take
them
one
by
one
and
say,
well,
we
don't
think
that
that
is
a
proper
term
to
use,
there
is
a
better
one?
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
appellant's
right
to
speak
freely
has
been
infringed
upon,
but
this
is
not
a
right
that
is
absolute.
this
is
commercial
speech,
and
i
think
the
state
has
a
right
reasonably
to
infringe
upon
his
right
to
speak
freely
as
long
as
it
does
not
do
it
unreasonably,
and
as
long
as
it
is
in
the
furtherance
of
the
state
interest,
which
concededly
exists,
and
in
the
language
of
central
hudson
does
not
go
any
farther
than
it
needs
to
go.
i
think
what
the
court
needs
to
do
is
look
at
the
missouri
rule
and
apply
the
central
hudson
test,
which
is
now
the
rule,
and
say,
does
it
go
beyond
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
public's
interest
in
not
being
misled
or
deceived
by
legal
advertising.
with
regard
to
the
other
questions
concerning
if
a
lawyer
has
violated...
is
accused
of
violating
two
or
more
rules,
and
then
this
court
finds
that
he
is
guilty
of
violating
one
but
not
the
other,
then,
of
course,
it
would
still
require
affirmance.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would,
in
applying
the
central
hudson
test,
find
that
missouri
rules
do
not
go
beyond
that
which
is
necessary
to
protect
the
state's
interest
and
affirm
the
decision
of
the
missouri
court.
mr.
john
w.
inglish
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
it
is
of
very
little
help
to
this
court.
it
is
of
very
little
help
to
me.
but
that
is
the
decision
of
the
missouri
supreme
court,
and
the
one
with
which
this
court
is
faced.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
