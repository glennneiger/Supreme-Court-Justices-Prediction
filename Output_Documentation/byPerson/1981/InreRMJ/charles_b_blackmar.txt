mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
may
adopt
rules
relating
to
legal
advertising
when
the
necessary
effect
is
to
inhibit
advertising
which
is
truthful,
effectual,
not
misleading,
and
beneficial
to
the
public.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
plead
a
particular
case
for
a
particular
client,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
decision
should
respond
to
the
case.
i
would
say,
though,
that
this
form
of
rulemaking
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
says,
this
you
may
say
and
nothing
else,
would
be
invalid.
i
am
not
here
to
argue
about
what
rules
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
might
adopt.
bates
specified
quite
a
few
suggestions,
such
as
arguing
about
the
quality
of
legal
services
and
things
like
that.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
did
not
follow
those
suggestions.
it
adopted
a
rule
listing
ten
permissible
categories
of
information,
and
saying
this
is
all
that
a
lawyer
may
advertise.
i
want
you
to
hold
that
rule
invalid.
what
other
rules
they
might
adopt,
that
is
not
my
problem
at
this
stage.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
you
would
have
to
say
that,
but
i
believe
you
would
necessarily
have
to
say
that
the
rule
that
says
that
this
you
may
say
and
nothing
else
is
invalid,
because
that
rule
would
necessarily
inhibit
protected
speech.
now,
the
balance
of
the
missouri
rule,
the
a
part
of
the
rule,
which
talks
about
advertising
that
is
misleading,
self-laudatory,
and
so
forth,
you
wouldn't
have
to
touch.
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
that
is
not
charged.
of
course,
there
is
another
part
of
this
case,
your
honor,
your
honors,
that
the
missouri
rule
completely
denies
the
mail
as
a
medium
of
legal
advertising.
we
argue
very
strongly
that
the
same
advertisement
that
could
be
published
in
the
newspaper
could
be
sent
in
the
mail,
and
so
that
is
another
part
of
the
case
which
supports
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
it
is
not
discussed
in
the
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
but
nevertheless,
it
certainly
is
present
in
the
case,
because
it
consists
of
one
of
the
four
charges.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
yes,
it
is
an
integrated
bar.
yes,
your
honor.
your
annual
license
fee
makes
one
a
member
of
the
bar.
but
now,
i
might
say
there
is
much
misunderstanding
on
this,
that
the
disciplinary
proceedings
are
something
that
the
missouri
bar
has
nothing
to
do
with.
those
have
been
totally
pre-empted
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
and
by
a
constituent
body
called
the
advisory
committee
of
the
missouri
bar.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
they
are
the
enforcement
arm
of
the
supreme
court.
i
think
that
is
important,
because
they
are
selected
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
would
say
that
the
enforcement
proceeding
is
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
supreme
court.
the
integrated
bar
has
no
authority
in
these
premises.
the
confusion
of
terms,
i
submit,
is
the
responsibility
of
the
court,
which
has
created
these
two
bodies
which
have
missouri
bar
in
them.
disciplinary
proceedings
are
the
province
of
the
court
entirely.
i
think
the
greatest
vice
in
the
rule
under
consideration
is
that
it
does
something
that
is
unprecedented
in
first
amendment
experience,
and
that
is
to
have
a
system
in
which
the
regulatory
authorities
specify
the
manner
of
speech,
rather
than
leaving
it
to
the
speaker
to
select
his
or
her
own
form
of
expression,
subject
to
proper
rules
that
might
be
drafted,
and
subject
to
the
rules
which
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
but
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case,
which
prevent
the
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
think
it
would
be
a
prior
restraint
argument.
it
says,
this
you
may
say
and
nothing
else.
now,
it
is
a
rule
of
general
application,
your
honor.
there
is
no
provision
for
applying
to
the
advisory
committee
or
to
the
court
for
permission
to
advertise
in
a
particular
way.
the
appellant,
the
lawyer
tried
that.
he
sent
this
ad
to
the
advisory
committee,
and
was
curtly
told
that
it
does
not
comply
with
the
rules
because
it
has
unauthorized
matter.
so,
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
at
all
that
this
is
a
prior
restraint
in
that
it
absolutely
forbids
certain
forms
of
expression.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
it
would
be
present,
in
that
it
does
not
pass
in
advance
on
what
the
speaker
says.
in
other
words,
he
takes
a
chance
that
something
that
he
might
say
might
be
found
to
be
a
violation
of
the
self-laudatory
rule.
by
the
way,
that
is
not
charged
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
well,
i
am
thinking
of
the
prior
restraint
as
something
that
says
that
unless
you
can
fit
something
into
these
particular
categories,
you
may
not
say
it,
and
i
think
that
would
be
different
from
the
self-laudatory
ad,
which
seeks
to
provide
an
external
standard.
by
the
way,
i
am
not
here
to
talk
about
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
prohibition
on
self-laudatory
statements,
but
i
think
that
that
sets
an
external
standard
that
the
speaker
has
to
conform
to.
it
doesn't
really...
it
doesn't
really
prohibit
the
speaker
from
using
his
or
her
own
language.
it
simply
says
that
if
you
transgress
this
line,
you
nay
be
subject
to
censure.
now,
the
rule
before
us
says
that
if
you
say
anything
such
as
this
appellant
said,
he
was
licensed
to
practice
in
missouri
and
illinois,
and
they
say
you
can't
say
that,
or
if
he
said
he
was
licensed
to
practice
in
the
federal
court,
that
is
not
one
of
the
things
that
is
listed,
so
it
can't
be
said.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
would
note
foreclose
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
something
like
that,
because
i
think
the
state
might
well
feel
that
it
was
misleading,
your
honor,
and
it
didn't
talk
about
the
case,
it
might
present
an
odious
comparison.
yes,
i
would
think,
and
we
have
said,
that
if
the
state
would
adopt
a
rule
that
said,
in
effect,
that
one
may
not
advertise
the
results
of
his
litigation,
the
size
of
his
verdicts,
or
the
number
of
acquittals,
or
something
like
that,
i
would
not
foreclose
that
kind
of
rule.
that
is
not
this
case,
and
so
i
am
not
going
to
argue
about
it.
now,
until
they
have
some
valid
regulation
like
that,
i
would
say
that
your
honors'
central
hudson
opinion
would
stand
in
the
way
of
doing
that
under
a
rule
that
is
not
narrowly
drawn.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
yes,
and
perhaps
you
can't
completely
foreclose
prior
restraint
when
you
are
talking
about
commercial
speech.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
think
there
would
be
a
balancing
problem.
i
believe
at
the
time
the
sec
act
was
passed
in
1933
and
1934,
i
don't
believe
that
at
that
time
it
was
really
thought
that
commercial
speech
was
subject
to
first
amendment
protection,
but
there
one
certainly
has
a
kind
of
prior
restraint.
you
have
to
submit
your--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--well,
i
suppose
that
prior
restraint
is
inherent
in
a
regulation
of
commercial
speech.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
yes,
and
of
course--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--of
course,
in
the
ohralik
opinion
the
court
did
balance
one's
right
to
speak
against
the
inhibitory
effects
of
allowing
a
person
to
person
solicitation.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
would
say
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say
in
commercial
speech
that
it
would
have
limited
application.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
it
would
be
weaker,
but
what
the
court
has
said,
though,
is
that
specifically
legal
advertising,
which
is
truthful
and
not
misleading,
is
protected
speech
which
may
be
regulated
only
by
narrowly
drawn
rules
directed
to
the
purpose,
and
i
think
that
that
really
is
sufficient
to
dispose
of
both
parts
of
this
case,
which
involve
an
absolute
prohibition
against
a
printed
ad
containing
something
that
is
not
specifically
prohibited,
and
an
absolute
prohibition
on
the
use
of
the
mails
as
a
medium
of
legal
advertising.
i
think
we
will
pretty
much
stand
on
that,
that
whatever
the
state
might
do
in
the
way
of
regulating
legal
advertising,
and
it
may
do
considerable,
it
cannot
do
it
by
the
form
of
rule
that
is
involved
in
both
parts
of
this
case.
by
the
way,
the
first
rule,
the
rule
2-101(b),
which
relates
to
credit
advertising,
is
a
rule
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
in
response
to
bates,
but
the
second
rule,
rule
102(a)(2),
regarding
mailed
announcements,
is
a
pre-bates
rule.
i
think
on
the
ground
that
the
court
below
did
not
consider
that
bates
applied
to
mail
advertising.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
thought
i
might
be
asked
that
question,
your
honor.
that
is
a
situation
in
which
you
would
have
to
decide
just
how
far
your
ohralik
opinion
went.
i
have
read
the
ohralik
opinion
many
times,
and
it
laid
great
stress
on
the
coercive
force
of
the
lawyer
at
the
hospital
with
his
contracts
all
ready
to
get
signature.
now,
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
how
a
letter
could
be
coercive
in
that
sense.
maybe
the
court
would
feel
that
a
letter
to
a
person
in
a
particularly
vulnerable
position
might
have
some
of
the
vice
of
ohralik,
so
i
wouldn't
foreclose
that
kind
of
regulation.
by
the
way,
the
mailing
involved
in
this
case
consisted
of
two
simple
tombstone
ads.
i
think
it
could
not
possibly
be
considered
misleading.
all
they
said
is,
here
i
am,
here
is
my
address,
here
is
my
phone
number,
i
have
opened
a
law
office.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
not
in
the
tombstone
ad.
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
not
in
the
mailed
ad.
the
mail
was--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--that
is
only
in
the
yellow
pages,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
suppose
the
general
public
would
have
to
decide
that.
that
is
something
that
lawyers
quite
frequently
advertise
in
martindale.
we
have
found
over
100
in
missouri.
i
would
argue
for
allowing
the
lawyer
to
say
something
that
is
truthful,
such
as
that
he
was
an
eagle
scout,
or
an
all-american
halfback.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
you
might
doubt
very
much
that
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
and
i
noticed
the
chief
justice's
expression
on
the
subject
of
admission
of
the
last
term
that
i
would
say
that
that
could
be
questioned.
if
a
state
felt
that
that
information
were
undesirable,
they
would
have
two
courses--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--if
they
thought
it
were
potentially
misleading.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
doubt
that
it
is,
really,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it
is--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--of
course,
the
rule
does
not
prohibit
that
because
it
relates
only
to
credit
advertising.
you
can
still
put
your
certificate
on
your
wall,
and
you
can
still--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--well,
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
that
the
regulatory
authorities
have
ever
gone
that
far,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
suppose
they
would
charge
that
that
was
an
advertisement,
too.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
if
they
think
it
is...
if
they
think
it
is
a
bad
thing.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
would
say
that
they
might
charge
him
with
sending
out
a
misleading
ad
under
the
rule
which
exists
for
that
purpose.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
if
they
are
concerned
about
that,
then
they
can
adopt
a
rule.
by
the
way,
if
they
think
that
there
is
any
danger
in
a
lawyer
announcing
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court,
i
suggest
two
courses,
one,
charging
him
with
a
misleading
ad,
which
he
wasn't
charged
with,
or
two,
adopt
a
specific
rule,
and
i
would
say
then
apply
it
to
the
people
in
martindale.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
yes,
i
think
that
would
cover
some
of
the
things
that
have
just
been
discussed,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
if
they
wanted
to
adopt
a
narrowly
drawn
rule
having
that
purpose,
if
they
concede
that
there
is
a
danger
in
certain
information,
then
the
courts
might
be
faced
with
a
balancing
task.
specifically,
i
would
say
that
the
size
and
verdicts,
results
received,
or
justice
marshal's
never
lost
a
case,
things
like
that,
i
think,
could
very
probably
be
prohibited
by
a
specific
rule.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
the
record
shows
that
he
included
the
required
disclaimer,
as
soon
as
he
was
aware
of
it.
now,
we
do
not
challenge
the
disclaimer
as
such.
that
was
specifically
recognized
by
the
bates
opinion
as
one
means
that
the
state
bar
might
use.
we
do
believe
that
the
disclaimer
could
be
misleading,
because
missouri
does
not
choose
to
certify
anybody
as
a
specialist.
under
those
circumstances,
we
believe
that
the
attorney
ought
to
be
able
to
state
that
fact
along
with
the
disclaimer,
because
otherwise
the
reader
might
get
the
idea
that--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--that
is
not
before
us.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
the
disciplinary
action
was
not
based
on
a
failure
to
include
the
disclaimer.
furthermore,
the
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
it...
the
court
below,
that
it
believes
that
this
rule
is
valid,
that
it
will
enforce
it
unless
the
result
is
otherwise
in
this
court.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
i
don't
know--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--this
is
my
first
appearance
in
argument.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
have
asked
to
get
in
here
many
times,
your
honor,
and--
0
[generallaughter.]
--have
not
had
the
chance.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
well,
i--
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
--well,
at
least
i
did
get
here
once.
that
is
about
all
i
could
say.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
doubt
that
it
would,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
members
of
the
bar
do
quite
regularly
list
that
in
the
legal
directories,
but
i
don't
believe...
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
suppose
that
he
probably
took
his
lead
from
other
members
of
the
profession
who
publish
the
fact
quite
freely.
i
suppose
also
the
purpose
of
any
advertising
isn't
to
entice
clients.
i
wouldn't
question
that.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
doubt
that
a
person
would
look
in
the
newspapers
to
try
to
find
that,
just
as
i
doubt
that
a
person
would
look
in
the
newspapers
to
try
to
find
a
lawyer
who
practices
financial
institution
law,
such
as
the
committee
permits,
or
international
law.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
i
think
it
is
no
great
distinction.
it
is
a
credential
that
one
requires
to
do
certain
things.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
you
might
have
an
ad
in
which
one
says,
i
have
argued
50
cases
in
the
supreme
court.
that
appears
to
me
to
be
the
plainest
fact,
and
i
don't
know
why
somebody
couldn't
publish
it
for
those
who
were
interested
in
knowing
it.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
it
means
that
he
could
file
papers
that
others
couldn't
file,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.

that,
i
think,
could
very
well
be
considered,
along
the
ohralik
line
of
a
statement
that
might
have
a
coercive
potential,
and
i
think
that
the
state
might
reach
something
like
that
by
an
appropriately
drawn
rule,
but
not
by
a
blanket
inhibition
of
the
mail.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
charles
b.
blackmar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
certainly
this
rule
does
not
comply
with
the
central
hudson
test,
because
it
does
prevent
the
dissemination
of
valuable
information
to
the
public.
just
one
example.
the
record
shows
that
this
lawyer
was
formerly
employed
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
he
can't
say
securities
law,
according
to
the
missouri
court,
because
that
is
not
one
of
the
listed
fields.
that
might
be
important
to
the
public.
i
am
thinking
of
the
person
who
is
reading
the
wall
street
journal,
or
his
daily
paper,
and
owns
a
little
stock,
and
finds
some
kind
of
add
about
a
class
suit,
and
wants
to
know
whether
to
opt
out
of
the
suit,
and
that
is
just
one
of
dozens
of
examples.
i
suggest
that
you
give
some
attention
to
the
arnold
phillips
amicus
brief,
in
which
the
lawyer
wanted
to
tell
people
about
chapter
13
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
and
the
advisory
committee
said
you
can't
do
it,
simply
because
it
is
not
one
of
the
things
that
is
listed.
now,
with
regard
to
the
considerable
discussion
of
being...
stating
the
fact
of
admission
to
the
bar
of
this
court,
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
result
in
the
court
below
would
had
been
any
different
if
that
part
had
not
been
contained
in
the
ad,
because
they
say
you
may
have
absolutely
nothing
that
is
not
listed.
i
submit
the
rule
cannot
stand.
no
count
can
stand.
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
