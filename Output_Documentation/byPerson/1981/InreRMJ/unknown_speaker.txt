unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
blackmar,
as
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
supposing
we
were
to
conclude
that
under
bates
the
rules
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
were
unconstitutional.
would
we
be
free
to
roam
at
large
beyond
this
particular
rule
and
say
that
a,
b,
c,
d
are
permitted,
but
e,
f,
g
are
not?
unknown
speaker
to
reverse
the
judgment,
we
wouldn't
even
have
to
hold
that
rule
invalid,
would
we?
all
we
would
have
to
say
is
that
your
client
should
not
have
been
privately
reprimanded
for
advertising
as
he
did
because
his
advertisement
was
permitted
under
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
now,
every
member
of
the
bar,
in
order
to
practice
in
the
state,
must
be
a
member
of
this
association,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
are
the
enforcement
arm?
unknown
speaker
are
they
not
in
effect
the
enforcement
arm
of
the
integrated
bar,
too?
unknown
speaker
now,
this,
i
gather,
is
the
prior
restraint
argument?
unknown
speaker
the
rule
prohibiting
self-laudatory
advertising
would
likewise
be
a
prior
restraint
then,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
two,
both
of
them
would
be
prior
restraints.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
appropriate
in
your
view
for
a
lawyer
who
practiced
personal
injury
law
to
say
that
my
average
verdicts
over
the
past
12
months
have
been
$129,000,
assuming
that
is
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
there
still
would
be
some
prior
restraint
element,
would
there
not?
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
a
balancing
problem
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
ad.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blackmar,
ever
since
we
have
had
ethics
and
codes
we
have
had
prior
restraint,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
admonition
against
ambulance
chasing
a
prior
restraint?
unknown
speaker
stay
away
from
ambulances.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
has
never
said,
has
it,
that
prior...
the
prohibitions
against
prior
restraints
are
absolute.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
weaker
there,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blackmar,
thinking
about
mail
advertising,
let's
assume
that
a
lawyer
had
access
to
the
names
of
people
who
were
admitted
to
the
emergency
room
of
a
great
hospital
in
a
large
city.
could
he
use
that
list
of
names
to
send
invitations
to
come
to
see
him
when
they
got
well
enough?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
about...
you
say
that
it
couldn't
possibly
be
misleading.
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
the
tombstone
ad,
the
first
bar
that
your
client
indicated
he
was
admitted
to
was
the
bar
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
not
in
the
tombstone.
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
yellow
pages?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
can
you
justify...
what
possible
value
was
there
in
putting
that
information
in
an
ad
that
went
to
the
general
public?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
information
help
a
potential
client
make
his
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
retain
that
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
anyone
who
has
a
case
in
this
court
probably
knows
that
he
can
find
a
lawyer
who
is
either
admitted
or
can
get
admitted
to
practice
here.
unknown
speaker
or
potentially
misleading.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
potentially
misleading,
isn't
it?
doesn't
it
suggest
that
the
man
has
a
special
qualification
that
he
really
doesn't
have?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blackmar,
how
far
does
that
rule
go?
under
our
rule
5,
after
you
have
paid
your
$100,
you
get
a
nice,
pretty
certificate.
you
have
it
framed,
and
you
hang
it
on
your
office
wall
or
you
hang
it
in
your
window,
i
or
on
the
front
door.
does
this
rule
prohibit
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
printed.
it
is
supposed
to
be
engraved,
but
it
is
not,
really.
it
is
just
printed.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
might
not
that
case
arise
if
we
say
that
this
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
printed,
it
is
deceptive
in
two
ways.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
young
lawyer
sending
out
an
advertisement
that
he
had
never
lost
a
case.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
he
hasn't
lost
one.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
mr.
blackmar,
is
it
proper
in
your
view
for
the
state
bar
to
prohibit
presumptively
misleading
ads,
not
those
which
are
actually
misleading,
but
those
which
might
easily
be
perceived
as
such,
those
which
are--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
you
another
question
relating
to
this
case.
was
the
attorney
in
this
case
disciplined
also
for
his
failure
to
include
the
disclaimer
language
in
the
ads
which
were
published?
the
rule
required
apparently
that
any
ad
listing
an
area
of
practice
indicate
in
bold
print
that
the
listing
of
the
areas
of
practice
does
not
indicate
any
certification
of
expertise.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
your
position
that
in
fact
it
was
included
and
that
the
disciplinary
action
was
not
based
in
any
way
on
the
failure
to
include
the
disclaimer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blackmar,
getting
back
to
advertising
that
one
is
admitted
to
practice
before
this
court,
i
gather
your
client
never
in
fact
had
a
case...
never
appeared
here
to
argue
a
case.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
i
noticed
from
your
application
that
this
is
your
first
appearance.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
in
a
different
position,
do
you
think,
now,
to
advertise
that
you
are
qualified
to
and
admitted
to
practice
before
this
court
even
though
he
couldn't?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
in
a
different
position
now
that
we
finally
did
grant
one
of
your
petitions
and
you
are
finally
able
to
argue
a
case
here?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
misleading
for
you
to
advertise
now
that
you
are
admitted
to
practice
before
this
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
admission
to
this
court
and
the
certificate
that
accompanies
it
would
convey
to
the
ordinary
layman
any
notion
or
the
notion
that
the
person
is
specially
qualified,
more
qualified
than
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lawyers
not
admitted
to
this
court?
unknown
speaker
a
representation
emphasizing...
an
ad
emphasizing
that
one
was
admitted
to
the
bar
of
this
court,
if
the
purpose
of
it
is
not
to
entice
some
clients,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
entice
clients
for
the
specific
purpose
of
handling
a
case
in
this
court.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
would
concede
that
the
admission
to
the
bar
of
this
court
and
the
receipt
of
the
certificate
standing
alone
doesn't
distinguish
a
lawyer
from
every
other
lawyer
that
practices
in
his
own
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wonder,
mr.
blackmar.
for
example,
it
is
certainly
true
that
rarely
does...
i
don't
know
when
we
will
see
you
again.
i
hope
soon,
but
it
is
not
often
that
private
practitioners
get
more
than
once
chance
to
come
here.
suppose
you
are
employed
in
the
solicitor
general's
office.
we
have
had
members
of
that
staff
who
have
argued
as
many
as
50
cases
here.
now,
if
they
go
back
to
practice
in
missouri,
you
don't
think
they
would
be
qualified
to
advertise
that
they
are
admitted
to
practice
here,
and
have?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
very
different
from
the
hypothetical
i
was
suggesting
to
you.
i
said
that
the
possession
of
that
certificate
standing
alone,
by
which
i
meant
to
exclude
any
experience
in
this
court,
doesn't
add
anything
to
the
person's
qualifications
except
that
it
is
a
representation
by
this
court
that
we
found
that
he
was
admitted
in
the
state
of
missouri
or
wherever.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blackmar,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
proper
and
not
subject
to
state
bar
regulation
for
an
attorney
to
send
out
letters
to
people
who
are
listed
in
the
newspaper
as
being
widows
of
recently
deceased
spouses,
listing
an
area
of
expertise
or
practice
as
representation
of
widows?
is
that
something
that
the
state
could
not
properly
reach?
unknown
speaker
mr.
inglish,
getting
back
to
the
colloquy
with
your
colleague,
what
about
the
certificate
of
admission
to
the
bar
of
this
court
that
you
post
in
your
office?
does
that
come
within
the
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
this
prohibition
is
rather
a
flat
one,
isn't
it,
against
advertising
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
mr.
inglish,
is
there
any
maritime
or
admiralty
practice
of
any
consequence
in
missouri?
you
do
have
some
navigable
streams.
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
who
engage
only
in
the
admiralty
practice?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
they
are
not
permitted
to
advertise
that,
are
they,
under
this--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
find
either
it
or--
unknown
speaker
--or
maritime.
unknown
speaker
they
are
under
another
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
a
decision,
don't
we...
i
can't
recall
the
name
of
it...
which
held
that
a
state
couldn't
disbar
a
patent
lawyer
for
a
patent...
that
that
was
something
that
had
to
be
done
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
which
he
was--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
inglish,
you
take
your
position
even
though
st.
louis,
as
is
kansas
city,
is
on
the
border
of
a
great
state?
they
are
great
cities
on
the
border
of
a
great
state,
and
you
think
it
would
not
be
of
some
help
to
a
litigant,
a
st.
louis
resident
who
was
injured
in
an
automobile
accident
in
east
st.
louis,
when
he
is
looking
for
a
lawyer,
to
know
that
he
is
admitted
in
the
state
of
illinois?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
lawyers
do
this
all
the
time
on
their
professional
announcements,
so
we
get
them
every
day.
unknown
speaker
and
here
in
washington,
every
firm
has
a
string
that
people
asterisk,
licensed
to
practice
in
california,
but
not
in
the
district,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
right
on
their
letterhead.
unknown
speaker
is
this
all
right?
would
it
be
all
right
under
your
missouri
bar
rules?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
misleading,
mr.
inglish?
unknown
speaker
or
admitted
to
the
bar
of
another
state?
unknown
speaker
and
aren't
we
dealing
with
that
here,
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
go
ahead.
in
justice
blackmun's
question,
with
the
asterisks
showing
admitted
to
practice
in
california
but
not
in
the
district,
might
not
that
supply
an
additional
element
of
truth,
if
the
firm's
letterhead
says
washington,
d.
c.,
and
lists
these
people
as
partners,
but
then
the
asterisks
show
that
they
are
not
actually
admitted
to
practice
in
the
district,
but
only
in
california?
unknown
speaker
mr.
inglish,
in
missouri
are
your
attorneys
prohibited
from
running
for
office?
unknown
speaker
of
course
not.
unknown
speaker
and
there
you
advertise
everything.
unknown
speaker
and
they
do.
unknown
speaker
and
they
do.
unknown
speaker
and
don't
you
have
some
lawyers
that
have
never
had
political
offices,
they
just
run
every
two
years
just
so
they
can
advertise?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
about
that.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
the
state
can
do
about
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
inglish,
one
of
the
limitations
in
the
rule
in
question
and
at
issue
here
is
a
requirement
that
if
a
lawyer
advertises
expertise
in
the
field
of
tort
law,
that
the
words
"tort
law"
be
used.
do
you
think
that
the
public
generally
understands
that
better
than
personal
injury
law?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
that
the
use
of
the
terms
"personal
injury
actions"
is
somehow
presumptively
misleading
in
this
context?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
precisely
what
the
missouri
regulation
permits,
since
it
doesn't
have
certification,
it
requires
the
disclaimer,
and
it
says,
you
will
use
only
these
areas
of
specialty
in
these
descriptive
terms.
unknown
speaker
mr.
inglish,
may
i
interrupt?
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
may
be
troubled
by
something
that
justice
o'connor
asked
you.
you
are
suggesting
it
could
have
been
a
better
rule.
tort
isn't
the
most
informative
rule
to
describe
a
personal
injury
specialist,
or
a
medical
malpractice
specialist.
but
do
you
defend
this
rule
as
being
constitutional?
do
you
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
below?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
adequate
to
say
"tort"
and
forbid
any
other
word?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
was
disciplined
because
he
did
not
use
the
word
"tort".
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
defend
that
discipline?
unknown
speaker
so
you
really
cannot
rely
on
the
fact
that
now
they
say
you
can
use
the
word
"negligence".
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
not
also
agree
that
tort
is
by
no
means
the
most
informative
word
to
describe
that
kind
of
practice?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
defend--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
it
is
perhaps
an
important
item
to
a
large
number
of
people
who
would
be
using
this
kind
of
method
of
finding
clients.
unknown
speaker
it
really
didn't
tell
us
very
much,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
should
say
that
in
any
respect,
because
of
the
way
they
handled
it,
they
had
violated
the
constitution,
then
this
judgment
has
to
be
reversed,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
in
what
respect
we
find
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
is
enough
if
they
were
wrong
as
to
any
one
of
them--
unknown
speaker
--since
they
didn't
tell
us
what
they
rested
it
on.
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
we
in
a
dilemma
there,
in
that
we
are
supposed
to
make
pronouncements
only
governing
the
facts
of
the
particular
case,
and
yet
obviously
there
is
some
necessity
for
a
broader
discussion,
and
yet
that
would
go
beyond
our
responsibility
to
decide
article
ii
cases--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
must
say,
mr.
inglish,
as
my
brother
rehnquist
just
suggested,
if
this
is
a
case
for
the
application
of
the
stromburg
rule,
as
i
think
you
just
told
me
you
thought
it
was,
if
we
find
anything
at
all
that
violates
the
first
amendment,
which
is
the
issue
tendered
to
us,
then
we
under
batchelor
and
maryland,
we
just
don't
reach
these
other
issues.
we
simply
set
aside
the
judgment,
that
is
all,
and
not
go
into
whether
or
not
all
the
other
things
similarly
present
constitutional
infirmities.
unknown
speaker
it
has
been
suggested
on
occasion
that
we
have
written
opinions
that
go
outside
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
what
the
organized
bar
in
the
various
states
is
seeking
is
some
sort
of
test
that
will
enable
the
various
organized
bars
to
establish
rules
and
the
test
laid
down
in
bates
as
i
understand
it
is
that
it
be
not
misleading
or
false,
and
i
would
think
that
a
chain
drugstore
advertisement
supplement
that
appears
in
most
big
daily
papers,
if
it
says
$2.99>
["],
and
if
they
do
have
window
cleaner
for
$2.99,
that
would
be
neither
false
nor
misleading.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
inglish,
that
doesn't
respond
to
the
problem
of
this
case,
because
there
is
no
reason,
in
light
of
what
your
present
argument
is,
why
the
missouri
bar
couldn't
have
said
the
following
expressions
will
be
permitted,
but
it
did
not
need
to
go
on
and
say
nothing
else
will
be
permitted.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
if
that
happened
presumably
on
review
of
the
case,
most
courts
would
give
us
some
information
about
why
that
wasn't
a
better
word.
your
court
apparently
didn't
want
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
suppose
that
was
the
case?
why
wouldn't
it
help

rule?

with
that
opinion,

guess.

mr.
inglish,
do
you
want
us
to
set
down
these
rules?
unknown
speaker
i
hope
not,
because
you
would
be
the
first
one
to
come
up
here
and
say
we
are
trying
to
run
the
country.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
unknown
speaker
affirm
it
that
the
word
"tort"
is
the
only
word
he
can
use?
you
want
us
to
affirm
that?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
how?

[generallaughter.]
unknown

well,
then,
you
don't
need
this
court.
unknown
speaker
how
many
people
in
your
town
know
what
"tort"
means?
unknown
speaker
how
many
lawyers
do
you
have?

[generallaughter.]
unknown

that
is
about
all.

is
all
that

about
"tort".
unknown
speaker
plus

mr.
inglish,
let
me...
we
are
going
to
adjourn
for
lunch
pretty
quick,
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
this
question,
in
response
to
your
colloquy
with
justice
brennan.
suppose
a
state
bar
accuses
someone,
a
lawyer,
of
doing
a
and
b,
and
whoever
is
the
adjudicator
finds
that
he
does
both
a
and
b,
and
they
suspend
him
for
doing
a
and
b.
it
happens
that
they
may
not
constitutionally
prevent
him
from
doing
a,
but
they
can
prevent
him
from
doing
b.
well,
he
has
done
both
of
them.
now,
did
you
agree
with
mr.
justice
brennan
or
justice
brennan
that
the
stromburg
rule
would
apply
in
that
situation,
that
the
suspension
must
be
lifted--
unknown
speaker
--if
one
of
the
grounds
is
invalid?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
agree
with?
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
suspension
have
to
be
lifted?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
what
you
and
i
were
talking
about,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
what
we
were
talking
about
is,
they
don't
tell
you
on
what
ground
they--
unknown
speaker
mr.
inglish,
do
you
think
we
should
read
the
missouri
court's
opinion
as
applying
the
central
hudson
test?
