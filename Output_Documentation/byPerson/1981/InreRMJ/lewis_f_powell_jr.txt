justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
involves
the
validity
of
rules
governing
the
advertisement
by
lawyers.
state
supreme
courts,
aided
by
the
organized
bar,
adopt
rules
or
canons
of
professional
conduct
that
now
include
regulation
of
advertising.
the
missouri
rule
had
issue
in
this
case
specifies
10
categories
of
information
that
may
be
included
in
an
advertisement.
it
limits
the
language
that
a
lawyer
may
use
in
identifying
the
areas
of
his
practice.
and
among
other
provisions,
it
allows
the
mailing
of
professional
announcement
cards
only
to
lawyers,
clients,
former
clients,
personal
friends
and
relatives.
there
also
is
a
restriction
against
identifying
oneself
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
or
of
the
bar
of
another
state.
the
missouri
disciplinary
committee
charged
their
lawyer
with
violation
by
the
advertising
that
he
published
in
telephone
directory
and
by
virtue
of
cost
it
was
sent
out
by
this
lawyer.
the
missouri
supreme
court
agreed
that
there
were
violations
of
the
rules
and
held
however
that
the
rules
were
perfectly
valid.
it
issued
a
private
reprimand
for
the
violations.
in
bates
against
arizona,
we
held
that
advertising
by
lawyers
is
a
form
of
commercial
speech
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
made
clear
however,
that
misleading
advertisement
is
not
protected.
moreover,
we
reiterate
today
that
the
potential
for
deception
and
confusion
is
particularly
strong
in
the
context
of
advertising
for
professional
services.
in
this
case,
although
the
advertising
violated
the
missouri
rules,
there
was
no
finding
that
it
was
inherently
misleading
or
that
the
public
had
in
fact
been
mislead.
we
conclude
therefore
that
the
missouri
rules,
as
applied
in
this
case,
cannot
be
squared
with
the
courtâ€™s
decision
in
bates
against
arizona.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
