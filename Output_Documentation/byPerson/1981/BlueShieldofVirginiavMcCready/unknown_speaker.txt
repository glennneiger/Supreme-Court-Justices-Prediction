unknown
speaker
the
class
she
claims
to
represent
are
the
patients,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
how
we
properly
reach
the
mccarren-ferguson
act
issue.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
consider
it,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
and
so
normally,
presumably,
we
wouldn't
get
into
it,
and
does
this
case
come
to
us
on
a
motion
under
rule
12(b)(6)
of
the
federal
rules?
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
to
assume
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
considered
favorably
to
the
pleader,
and
has
the
plaintiff
below
at
least
allege
both
a
boycott
and
coercion.
unknown
speaker
so
i
wasn't
sure
how
we
would
get
into
the
mccarren-ferguson
act
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
right
on
the
standing
issue,
that
would
end
it,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
never
get
to
the
mccarren-ferguson
act
then.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
it
sounds
like
that
particular
approach
and
maybe
the
target
area,
too,
is
just
an
early
way
in
the
case
to
decide
the
question
of
causation,
and
to
avoid
a
long
trial
on
that
if
it's
clear
enough,
because
even
if
you
lose
at
this
stage,
you
are
going
to
be
making
the
same
argument
down
on
the
end
of
the
case
that
whatever
injury
that
was
suffered
here
wasn't
caused
by
the
breakdown
in
competition.
unknown
speaker
you
are
still
going
to
be
making
it
later
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
make
it
now
and
avoid
a
long
trial.
unknown
speaker
isn't
what
you
are
saying
in
essence
that
antitrust
injury
is
a
narrower
concept
than
injury
which
flows
in
a
but
for
causation
way
from
an
antitrust
violation?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
for
the
provision
in
the
contract,
though,
if
the
contract
had
covered
the
services
of
clinical
psychologists,
she
would
have
been
reimbursed.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
contract
included
chiropractors,
if
she
went
to
a
chiropractor,
but
it
is
a
matter
of
contract,
then,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
this
the
basis
on
which...
this
direct
and
indirect
point
you
were
mentioning,
is
that
the
basis
on
which
you
distinguish
reiter
against
sonotone,
that
in
reiter
the
injury
occurred
directly
from
the
conspiracy
to
fix
the
prices?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
then
that
we
should
judge
this
case,
although
i
am
sure
you
don't
concede
that
there
was
an
antitrust
violation,
but
we
must
judge
the
case
at
this
stage
as
though
there
was
one--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
promise
between...
that
the
agreement
was...
violated
the
antitrust
laws?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
the
provision
in
the
agreement
between
blue
cross
and
the
doctors--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
antitrust
violation
that
was
found
in
the
other
case?
unknown
speaker
a
restraint
of
what
market
or
of
what--
unknown
speaker
--people
in
the
market
for
mental
treatment?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
restraint
of
competition,
or
a
boycott,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
until
you
know
what
the
antitrust
violation
is,
it
is
hard
to
understand
an
argument
that
it
didn't
cause
this
injury.
unknown
speaker
is
the
effect
of
the
fourth
circuit
holding,
the
majority
holding,
that
they
can't
have
this
kind
of
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
excluding
clinical
psychologists?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
that
interpretation
forever
binds
them?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
get
where
the
competitive
threat
between
what
two
entities--
unknown
speaker
--i
am
talking
about
the
contract.
the
contract
was
not
made
by
the
physicians,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
are
complaining
that
this
contract
is
now
construed
to
exclude
the
psychologists.
unknown
speaker
then
you
have
confused
me.
you
just
said
that
at
one
time
they
construed
the
contract
to
include
direct
payments
to
clinical
psychologists,
and
now
they
construe
it
another
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
my
question
to
you
was,
does
the
construction
of
the
contract
in
one
way
forever
bind
them
to
continue
to
construe
it
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you
have
changed
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
mr.
furr,
what
exactly
is
the
difference
if
you
don't
get
paid
pursuant
to
contract
or
without
contract?
the
complaint
is
that
you
don't
get
paid.
unknown
speaker
i'm
kind
of
lost
on
your
answer,
then.
suppose
blue
shield
put
in
its
contract
that
we
won't
pay
clinical
ex-ray
people.
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
will
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
assume
that
if
blue
shield
says,
in
order
to
violate
the
antitrust
law,
we
will
do
this,
i
certainly
didn't
assume
that.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
say
a
word
about
antitrust.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
insurance
contracts.
i'm
not
talking
about
surgeons.
unknown
speaker
did
the
physicians
make
up
this
contract?
unknown
speaker
did
they
make
up
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
because
i
am
going
to
ask
you
where
that
is
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
but
the
physicians
didn't
draw
the
contract.
blue
shield
drew
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
wholly
apart
from
all
this,
you
are
alleging
conspiracy,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
between
the
physicians
and
blue
shield.
that's
the
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
afraid
to
say
so?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
say
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
won
on
that.
unknown
speaker
you
won
in
another
case
on
that,
haven't
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
furr,
would
your
position
be
the
same
and
would
mrs.
mccready
have
standing
if
she
had
purchased
the
policy
directly
from
blue
shield?
unknown
speaker
your
position
would
be
exactly
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--as
if
going
through
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
and
she
presumably
could
have
bought
a
policy
that
would
have
covered
clinical
psychologist
services
that
did
not
require
going
through
a
physician,
from
some
other
source.
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
let's
go
back
to
if
she
were
buying
it
directly.
presumably
other
sources
would
be
available.
how
would
she
have
standing
then
for
this
kind
of
an
antitrust
action?
unknown
speaker
these
same
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
the
test
is
different
at
this
stage,
the
legal
test
is
different
at
this
stage
of
the
lawsuit
than
it
would
be
after
the
trial
is
over,
do
you?
it
is
just
maybe
the
facts
aren't
as
fully
developed
as
they
would
be
at
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
that
at
this
stage
it
would
be
just
a
flat
but
for
causation?
unknown
speaker
what
if
i
plead
in
a
complaint
that
i
am
a
landlord
and
i
had
a
tenant
who
has
been
subjected
to
an
antitrust
violation
and
as
a
result
he
has
gone
out
of
business,
and
as
a
result
i
have
not
been
able
to
collect
my
rent?
do
you
think
that
that
is
antitrust
injury?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
factual
investigatory
stage
fully
supported
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
and
nothing
more,
that
there
was
a
landlord,
there
was
a
tenant,
the
tenant
had
been
subjected
to
an
antitrust
violation
and
gone
out
of
business,
and
the
landlord
couldn't
collect
his
rent?
unknown
speaker
mr.
furr--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
this
really
a
fight
between
the
psychiatrists
and
the
psychologists,
and
if
so,
how
did
you
happen
to
exclude
the
psychologists
from
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
just
a
fight,
but
isn't
it
a
fight
or
primarily
a
fight?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
it
still
seems
curious
to
me
that
the
parties
primarily
concerned
are
absent
from
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
what
did
that
case
hold?
i
don't
recall
it
specifically.
i
remember
we
did
deny
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
you
have
had
a
stronger
case
if
you
had
included
them,
so
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
about
standing?
unknown
speaker
but
psychologists
have
never
been
a
party
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
you
conceded,
i
thought,
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
that
this
is
like
the
landlord
and
tenant
case.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
that
the
landlord...
that
there
would
be
a
recovery,
in
response
to
his
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
i
come
back...
i
am
confused
about
your
responses,
and
i
want
to
clear
it
up...
i
come
back
to
your
response
to
justice
rehnquist.
under
the
language
you
just
read,
is
it
your
position
that
the
landlord
was
injured
by
the
antitrust
action
because
the
tenant
could
no
longer
pay
his
rent?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
heard
his
hypothetical.
the
antitrust
violation
put
the
tenant
out
of
business.
the
tenant
may
have
some
recovery
for
that
violation,
of
course,
but
does
the
landlord
have
recovery?
that
is
the
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
fact,
if
we
rely
on
the
literal
language,
it
would
allow
a
shareholder
of
the
landlord
to
recover,
too.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not
arguing
we
should
read
the
statute
literally,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
that
we
give
it
its
full
literal
meaning,
allow
everyone
to
recover
who
is
injured
by
reason
of
an
antitrust
violation?
unknown
speaker
you
would
allow
the
shareholder
of
the
landlord
whose
tenant
was
injured
to
proceed
beyond
a
motion
to
dismiss
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
illinois
brick,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
win
on
the
landlord's
case
to
win
your
case,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
might
as
well
argue
that.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
it
is
a
direct
injury.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
furr,
you
say
she
is
in
the
target
area,
but
how
do
you
define
the
target
area?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
target
of
the
conspiracy
in
your
answer
to
justice
powell
was
the
competition
from
psychologists
who
compete
with
psychiatrists.
the
psychiatrists
don't
like
that
competition
and
want
to
curtail
it.
so
couldn't
one
in...
i
mean,
it
is
a
question
of
where
you
put
the
label,
i
suppose.
couldn't
one
define
the
target
area
as
the
competitors
that
the
defendants
want
to
drive
out
of
business
or
harm?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that
i
suppose
that
if
the
psychologist
got
less
business
because
of
this,
he
can
recover,
can't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
all
the
defendants
have
taken
away
from
their
competitors,
is
what
he
could
recover
in
that
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
isn't
that
the
entire
pie?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
terms
of
the
conspiracy
that
you
are
talking
about,
would
it
be
any
different
if
the
doctors
who
didn't
want
competition
from
psychologists
went
to
all
the
banks
in
town
and
said,
don't
lend
them
any
money,
or
went
to
the
suppliers
of
pharmaceutical
goods
of
one
kind
and
said,
boycott
all
the
psychologists
because
we
want
to
drive
them
out
of
business?
would
she
then
have
a
claim
because
her
psychologist
was
driven
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
harder
case?
unknown
speaker
but
here--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
is
really
my
question,
because
here,
as
i
understand
the
conspiracy,
it
is
putting
the
economic
pressure
on
the
psychologist
by
saying,
you
are
not
going
to
get
insurance
reimbursement.
how
is
that
different
from
saying,
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
borrow
money?
unknown
speaker
i
hurt
every
client
who
didn't
abandon
her
psychologist
or
his
psychologist.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
way
the
psychologist
got
hurt
was
by
the
ones
who
did
abandon
them.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
furr,
under
the
terms
of
the
policy
which
were
known
at
the
time
of
purchase,
this
reimbursement
wouldn't
be
made,
and
couldn't
the
employer
or
mrs.
mccready
have
obtained
other
insurance
coverage
that
would
have
allowed
payment?
i
mean,
they
knew
that
when
it
was
obtained.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
is
a
defense,
it
still
is
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
it
might
be.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
did
grant
certiorari
on
the
question,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
both
questions
were
stated
in
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
and
we
just
granted
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
it
was
an
improvident
grant
of
certiorari--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
second
question.
unknown
speaker
general
bell,
may
i
ask
a
question
on
that?
i
have
been
thinking
about
this,
after
the
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
supposing...
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
think
through
the
case
with
the
insurance
in
it.
supposing
the
doctors
had
gotten
together
and
said,
we
are
going
to
boycott
the
banks
in
order
to
get
the
banks
to
refuse
to
do
business
with
the
psychologists
in
order
to
drive
them
out
of
business,
and
they
were
successful,
and
some
banks
lost
business
as
a
result
of
the
boycott.
now,
they
are
aiming
at
the
psychologists,
but
they
hurt
the
banks
in
accomplishing
their
objective.
would
they
be
covered
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
his
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
in
his
colloquy
with
justice
white,
is
that,
well,
they
are
refusing
to
pay
benefits
to
people
who
do
business
with
the
psychologists
that
we
want
to
put
out
of
business.
it
is
their
claim
to
the
insurance
company
that
is
denied.
they
pay
the
provider,
and
they
put
in
their
claim
to
the
blue
cross
and
they
get
turned
down.
unknown
speaker
that
is
pretty--
