mr.
griffin
b.
bell
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
two
questions.
the
first
question
is,
was
there
an
antitrust
injury
alleged
so
as
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
rule
12(b)(6),
and
i
use
antitrust
injury
in
the
same
vein
as
this
court
used
it
in
brunswick
versus
pueblo
bowl-o-mat.
the
second
question,
was
blue
shield
exempt
from
antitrust
laws
as
being
in
the
business
of
insurance
under
the
mccarren-ferguson
act.
this
was
a
class
action
with
one
plaintiff
purporting
to
represent
the
class.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
patients.
well,
the
patients,
all
patients
who
went
to
a
clinical
psychologist
and
who
at
the
same
time
were
entitled
to
benefits
under
blue
shield
contracts.
this
plaintiff
was
an
employee
of
prince
william
county.
prince
william
county
had
a
contract
for
medical
services
which
they
purchased
from
blue
shield
of
virginia.
plaintiff
was
treated
by
a
clinical
psychologist,
and
sought
reimbursement
from
blue
shield
of
virginia.
that
is
the
gist
of
the
complaint.
she
wishes
to
be
reimbursed.
her
request
for
reimbursal
was
refused
on
the
grounds
that
the
plan
only
covered
physician's
services
and
other
allied
health
services
which
are
supervised
by
and
billed
through
a
physician.
the
case
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
there
was
another
case
filed
at
the
same
time.
they
started
out
being
heard
together,
and
one
was
decided
last
year
by
the
fourth
circuit.
it
is
called
the
vacp
case.
in
that
case,
the
district
court
ruled
for
the
blue
shield
plans
and
psychiatrists,
but
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
there
was
a
restraint.
the
restraint
was
in
the
sector
or
area
of
restraining
clinical
psychologists
by
not
covering
them
under
these
contract.
it
was
a
plan
that
was
devised,
so
the
court
held,
by
the
two
plans,
two
plans
in
virginia,
both
of
whom
are
in
this
case,
along
with
the
doctors
and
particularly
the
psychiatrists,
to
block
out
the
clinical
psychologist
from
being
covered.
now,
that
is
the
antitrust
allegation
that
is
the
base
for
this
case
brought
by
this
patient
of
a
psychologist.
i
am
going
to
spend
a
little
time
arguing
the
mccarren-ferguson
point,
because
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
a
second
circuit
case
called
pireno,
and
it
is
pending
here
now.
it
is
very
much
on
our
case,
and
if
we
are
exempt
from
antitrust
coverage
by
mccarren-ferguson,
then
you
wouldn't
necessarily
reach
the
other
point
which
is
antitrust
injury.
unfortunately,
though,
the
questions
tie
together
because
it
has
been
held
at
one
point
in
the
case,
in
the
district
court,
that
there
was
a
boycott,
so
if
there
was
a
boycott,
then
we
have
to
get
back
to
the
same
issue,
target
area,
was
mrs.
mccready
in
the
sector
or
the
area
where
the
antitrust
violation
took
place.
there
are
three
elements
that
must
appear
to
have
an
exemption
under
the
mccarren-ferguson
act.
first,
there
must
be
the
business
of
insurance.
second,
there
has
to
be
state
regulation
of
the
activity
in
question.
and
third,
it
must
appear
that
there
is
no
boycott.
there
can't
be
a
boycott
and
still
have
coverage.
they
have
the
exemption.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
there
was
state
regulation
here.
that
is
what
the
lawsuit
was
about.
the
two
plans
would
not
follow
the
state
law.
they
contested
it,
and
finally
lost,
but
they
won
part
of
the
case,
and
that
was
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
the
statute
required
that
they
deal
directly
with
psychologists.
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
it
was
not
corrected
up
until
july
1,
1979,
so
we
are
talking
about
damages
that
accrued
before
july
1,
1979,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
contested,
the
the
state
regulation,
so
if
this
was
the
business
of
insurance,
this
policy
that
they
had
that
you
could
only
get
allied
health
or
medical...
health
services
through
a
doctor,
if
that
was
underwriting
or
spreading
of
the
risk
within
the
meaning
of
the
royal
drug
case,
then
we
have
the
question...
we
have
the
business
of
insurance.
so,
the
only
element
left
to
be
decided
would
be,
was
there
a
boycott.
now,
the
boycott
that
the
district
court
found,
judge
bond,
this
is
the
only
mention
that
has
been
made
of
this
in
all
this
litigation,
was
that
there
was
a
boycott
alleged.
well,
at
that
time,
he
was
dealing
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
involving
the
doctors
and
the
plans
as
well
as
mrs.
mccready's
case,
and
i
read
that
to
mean
he
was
talking
about
a
boycott
in
this
primary
level
or
this
sector
between
doctors
and
psychologists.
if
so,
then
the
same
answer
would
come
from
the
argument
i
am
next
going
to
make
about
antitrust
injury
would
indicate
that
there
was
no
boycott,
so
that's
why
i
say
that
the
two
issues
tie
together.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
it.
well,
i
won't
say
ignored
it.
they
did
not
consider
it.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
does.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
they
alleged
a
boycott
twice
in
there,
in
the
complaint.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
this
was
in
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
it,
and
it
was
called
to
the
court
of
appeals'
attention
on
the
petition
for
rehearing,
and
i
would
assume
that
the
court
can
deal
with
any
issue
that
is
in
the
case
as
a
part
of
the
case,
but
i
think
that
the
short
answer
to
the
question
is
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
a
boycott
is
alleged,
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
injury
suffered
by
mrs.
mccready
was
not
in
the
area
of
the
antitrust
violation,
then
there
couldn't
be
a
boycott.
even
if
there
was
a
boycott,
it
would
not
relate
to
her.
it
wouldn't--
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
--it
would
end
it.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
you
wouldn't
have
to
get
to
the
mccarren-ferguson
question.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
so,
i
will
go...
i
will
just
mention
one
other
thing
about
mccarren-ferguson,
and
then
i
will
discontinue
that
argument,
and
that
is
that
in
the
royal
drug
case,
and
there
have
been
some
other
cases...
there
is
one
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
they
said
that
peer
review
was
the
business
of
insurance.
pireno
in
the
second
circuit
says
peer
review
is
not.
well,
this
question
we
have,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
we
ought
to
cover
clinical
psychologists,
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
relationship
between
an
insurer
and
a
subscriber
or
policy-holder,
if
you
will.
it
also
goes
to
the
heart
of
underwriting.
do
you
care
to
underwrite,
do
you
wish
to
underwrite
this
kind
of
business,
and
how
will
the
risk
be
spread?
is
the
mechanics
of
it
such
that
it
bears
directly
on
spreading
the
risk?
i
think
it
does,
but
i
will
go
on
to
the
next
argument,
because
the
next
argument
would
end
the
case
if
we
are
right
about
it,
and
that
is
antitrust
injury.
was
there
an
antitrust
injury
here
within
the
meaning
of
the
decision
in
brunswick
versus
pueblo
bowl-o-mat.
the
fourth
circuit
cited
only
two
cases
in
support
of
their
rule,
and
one
was
reiter
versus
sonotone,
a
case
involving
a
direct
purchaser
and
price
fixing,
nothing
like
this
case.
they
cited
their
own
case
of
south
carolina
council
of
milk
producers,
where
there
had
been
a
breakdown
in
the
competitive
level
of
the
retail
marketing.
milk
was
being
sold
as
a
loss
leader.
the
farmers,
the
milk
producers
brought
a
suit
saying
that
it
was
adversely
affecting
the
price
of
milk,
and
the
fourth
circuit
went
off
on
two
points.
one
was
whether
these
milk
producers
were
in
the
sector
of
the
economy
which
was
endangered
by
the
antitrust
activity,
the
breakdown
in
competition,
and
then
whether
there
was
proximate
cause
which
would
lead
from
that
to
these
milk
producers.
they
decided
this
case
almost
on
the
same
basis,
which
i
think
converts
the
antitrust
law
almost
into
a
general
tort
statute,
and
it
is
difficult,
though,
to
take
any
of
the
rules
i
have
found
in
the
country,
in
all
the
cases
in
the
circuits,
and
the
learned
treatises,
and
apply
them
to
facts.
judge
bond
said
it
pretty
well
in
the
district
court.
he
said
that
while
standing
an
antitrust
injury
may
not
be
the
same
issue,
here
there
is
no
standing
because
there
is
no
antitrust
injury.
he
put
it...
he
tested
it
rather
than
starting
out
with
a
definition.
i
think
that
judge
mansfield
in
the
calderone
case
almost
hit
onto
a
workable
formula,
but
he
kept
changing
from
target
area
to
target,
and
i
suppose
there
can
be
sometimes
where
you
wouldn't
be
a
direct
target,
yet
you
would
still
be
covered
if
the...
if
you
were
in
the
area
of
the
breakdown
in
the
economy,
so
i
first
got
off
on
the
idea
that
maybe
we
ought
to
talk
about
targets,
but
i'm
not
certain
that's
the
way
to
do
it,
and
i
end
up,
after
looking
at
all
the
cases,
where
there
seems
to
be
two
clear
groups.
one
is
what
some
of
the
writers
call
categorization.
that
would
be
like
a
landlord
or
shareholder,
a
creditor
who
doesn't
have
standing
to
complain
about
the
antitrust
violation.
and
then
the
others,
it
seemed
to
me
to
get
down
to
whether
you
are
too
far
away
from
where
the
breakdown
in
the
economy
took
place.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
that
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
we
would
be
making
that
argument.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
oh,
yes.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
we
are
saying
that
the
question
can
be
truncated,
because
it
appears
as
a
matter
of
law
that
mrs.
mccready
was
far
removed
from
the
breakdown
in
the
competition
which
was
between
the
doctors,
that
she
was
two
steps
away.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
exactly,
and
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
treated
it
just
like
tort
injury.
antitrust
injury
carries
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees,
and
we
don't
think
congress...
in
fact
this
court
said
so
in
brunswick,
that
it
was
to
be
a
narrower
category,
and
the
question,
the
problem
is
how
to
draw
the
line.
it
is
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line,
but
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
that
this
lady
is
two
steps
away.
she
is
what
we
might
call
a
policyholder.
she
was
in
a
market
where
you
could
buy
all
the
insurance
you
wanted,
no
competitive
breakdown
there.
she
was
also
in
another
market.
she
was
in
the
health
services
market.
she
could
get
a
doctor
or
get
a
clinical
psychologist,
and
that
was
unrestrained.
the
restraint
was
farther
over,
between
the
doctors
and
these
plans
for
not
covering
clinical
psychologists,
so
we...
our
argument
is
that
if
there
was
an
antitrust
violation,
which
the
fourth
circuit
held
in
the
other
case,
then
you
have
to
define
the
sector
of
the
economy
and
draw
a
line
around
it
or
circle
it,
and
then
the
next
step,
was
she
injured
by
something
that
happened
within
that
circle,
and
we
say
she
was
not.
but
i
concede
that
it
is
not
very
easy
to
draw
those
lines.
there
are
no
bright
lines
in
this
area
of
the
law
that
i
can
see.
i
guess
that
is
why
we
have
a
case
like
illinois
brick,
because
you
are
always
worrying
about
whether
someone
is
too
far
away.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
she
would
have
been,
if
the
coverage
had
run
to
clinical
psychologists,
as
it
does
now.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
has
been
done
now
by
statute.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
yes,
it
is.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
exactly.
precisely.
in
reiter,
mrs.
reiter
was
a
purchaser
in
a
market
where
prices
had
been
fixed.
she
was
a
direct...
she
suffered
direct
injury.
she
was
in
the
sector.
here,
mrs.
mccready
was
a
long
way
from
the
sector.
she
would
recover
under
a
tort,
general
tort
theory
on
a
but
for
basis,
and
on
a
foreseeability
basis.
you
would
say,
yes,
if
they
would
not
cover
clinical
psychologists,
and
they
did
it
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
there
would
be
people
in
the
chain
that
would
be
harmed,
all
the
way
down
to
a...
at
least
to
a
policyholder,
but
that
would
be
a
general
tort
approach,
which
we
say
was
not
intended
by
the
congress.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
yes.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
you
would
have
to
because
of
the
other
case
which--
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
--we
lost
and
applied
for
certiorari
and
certiorari
was
denied,
so
they
found
an
antitrust
violation
by
excluding
psychologists.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
between--
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
--well,
in
the
agreement
between
the
two
plans.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
blue
shield.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
blue
shield,
and
they
said
that
that
was
a
restraint
against
the
psychologists,
and
the
restraint
was
a
very
peculiar
thing.
it
was
because
they
were
not
following
the
virginia
law.
they
were
contesting
the
virginia
law.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i...
it
is
fairly
difficult
to
tell
from
reading
the
opinion,
but
i
think
it
was...
my
best
judgment
was,
it
was
a
restraint
by
the
two
plans,
or
between
the
two
plans.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
the
market
for
services
of
a
clinical
psychologist.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
just
the
doctors.
just
the
clinical
psychologists,
not
their
patients.
i
think
that
is
very
clear
from
the
fourth
circuit
opinion.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
you
could
call
it
a
boycott,
but
the
court
wrote
about
two
pages
on
the
fact
that
they
wouldn't
find
a
boycott
because
they
wouldn't
find
a
boycott
to
be
a
per
se
violation
in
the
medical
field.
it
is
a
very
confusing
opinion.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
--we
know
that
the
violation...
the
parameters
of
the
violation.
it
was
in
the
area
of
the
blocking
out
or
boycotting
the
clinical
psychologists,
not
giving
them
coverage.
that
is...
there
is
no
way
that
i
see
from
the
opinion
you
could
argue
for
a
broader
area.
now,
if
you
could
argue
that
the
violation
ran
to
a
much
broader
area,
the
field
of
health
services,
and
people
buying
health
insurance,
then
you
would
have
quite
a
different
question,
and
that
is
what
makes
the
case
hard,
to
draw
the...
first,
draw
the
line
of
where
the
violation
was,
and
then
connect
the
plaintiff
to
that
area
of
the
violation.
the
cases
say
the
sector
where
the
competition
was
endangered
by
a
breakdown
due
to
the
antitrust
violation,
but
it's
an
area,
fulcrum,
it's
some
point
of
the
violation.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
they
say
you
can't--
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
--it
is
not
quite
that
broad,
because
the
virginia
legislature,
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
passed
a
law
that
you
had
to
deal
directly
with
any
of
these
allied
health
services.
there
are
about
four
or
five
of
them.
one
of
them
was
clinical
psychologists.
it's
the
same
as
telling
them
they
have
to...
if
they
are
going
to
use
their
services,
they
have
to
deal
directly
with
them.
i
don't
believe
the
statute
goes
so
far
as
saying
you
have
to
cover
these
people.
they
called
it
the
direct
user
statute,
and
this
was
in
litigation
for
several
years,
and
it
has
been
out
for...
now,
lost
it,
but
as
i
read
the
virginia
supreme
court
opinion,
it
is
that
you
don't
have
to
cover
clinical
psychologists,
but
if
you
do,
you
have
to
deal
with
them
directly.
you
can't
make
them
go
through
a
physician,
is
what
it
gets
down
to.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
little
time.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
about
two
minutes,
if
it
please
the
court.
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
idea
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
counsel
opposite
says
we
ought
to
have
a
full-scale
hearing.
as
i
understand
the
administration
of
the
judicial
process,
courts
decide
cases
like
brunswick
to
teach
lower
courts
and
lawyers
how
to
handle
complicated
matters.
now,
if
our
case
does
fit
into
brunswick,
then
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
judgment
of
dismissal.
that
gets
down
to
just
one
real...
one
issue.
there
is
only
one
thing
dividing
us,
as
i
understand
the
argument.
we
both...
he...
the
argument
is
that...
mrs.
mccready's
argument,
that
you
have
to
have
an
antitrust
violation
and
causation.
that
is
all
you
have
to
allege.
i
say
that
brunswick
teaches
one
other
step,
one
other
factor.
you
have
an
antitrust
violation,
and
then
you
have
to
have
a
sector
or
market
in
which
competition
is
injured.
now,
that
is
said
in
brunswick.
it
says
there
that
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
protect
competition,
but
not
competitors.
now,
the
competition,
it
is
without
doubt
in
this
case
that
the
competition
injured
is
between
the
psychiatrists
and
the
clinical
psychologists,
so
you
have
to
have
causation
that
relates
to
that,
to
that
area,
so
you
have
to
define
that
area.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
they
might
be,
because
the
way
you
describe
it,
they
both
are
subject...
the
subject
matter
of
the
boycott,
the
bank
and
the
psychologist.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
they
got
turned
down
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
not
physician
services.
that
is
not
outside
the--
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
--that's
in
their
complaint.
they
say
that
the
plan
is
a
plan
under
which
payment
for
psychological
services
are
made
when
those
services
are
rendered
by
a
physician.
that
was
the
plan
in
which
she
was
a
subscriber
through
the
county,
but
on
the
example
justice
stevens
just
gave,
it
is
sort
of
typical
of
this
area
of
the
law.
on
the
landlord
question,
i
finally
decided
that
all
those
cases
fitted
into
something
you
would
call
derivative.
they
are
derivative
rights.
the
shareholders,
landlords,
creditors,
and
this
case
almost
is
a
derivative
case.
i
have
not
argued
that,
but
she
is
a
policyholder
under
this
plan,
and
she
is
almost
in
the
shape
of
a
derivative
right,
but
you
can't
decide
this
case
under
any
sort
of
a
magic
of
what
has
been
held
in
a
lot
of
other
cases.
it
is
sort
of,
i'd
say...
each
case
has
to
go
on
its
own.
you
have
to
have
some
general
principles,
and
i
think
those
three
factors
that
i
just
gave
are
the
factors,
and
not
the
two
that
my
opposition
argues
for.
one
is
a
general
tort
and
the
other
one
is
an
antitrust
type
tort.
thank
you.
