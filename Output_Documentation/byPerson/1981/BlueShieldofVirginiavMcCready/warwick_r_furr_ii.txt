mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
alleges...
alleges
in
here
complaint
a
direct
financial
injury
from
conduct
which
has
already
been
proven
to
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
in
the
other
case
that
esteemed
counsel
referred
to,
the
vacp
case,
are
identical
to
the
operative
acts
of
antitrust
violation
charged
in
this
complaint
that
is
before
the
court
on
this
appeal
from
the
reversal
of
an
order
dismissing
a
complaint
under
rule
12(b)(6)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
now,
there
are
a
couple
of
preliminary
remarks
i
wanted
to
make
before
i
pick
up
the
questions
of
legal
injury
or
antitrust
injury
and
the
possibility
of
mccarren-ferguson
exemption
here.
first,
the
petitioners'
arguments
in
their
brief
are
shot
through
with
factual
assertions
that
the
respondent
here
can't
be
injured,
or
she
can't
prove
an
antitrust
violation
as
to
her,
and
coupled
with
other
assertions
as
to
why
their
practices
are
defensible,
and
why
they
are
the
business
of
insurance.
it
seems
to
me
these
factual
assertions
miss
the
mark
in
this
court.
these
assertions
for
the
most
part
are
contested,
if
not
bitterly
contested.
to
take
one
example,
they
argue
that
she
cannot
recover
because
her
health
insurance
contract
precludes
payments
to
clinical
psychologists.
by
contrast,
we
contend,
based
on
the
unanimous
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
vacp
case,
and
the
evidence
in
that
record,
that
for
many
years
blue
shield
interpreted
the
very
same
contracts
at
issue
here
to
treat
clinical
psychologists
as
physicians
and
to
pay
them
directly.
more
specifically,
from
1962
to
1972,
they
did
interpret
the
contracts
to
pay
clinical
psychologists.
so
we
think
that
regardless
of
who
is
right,
and
we
think
we
are
right,
that
these
are
contested
factual
issues
on
important
facts.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
no,
sir,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
when
they
make
a
decision
in
1972
to
restrict
payments
to
clinical
psychologists
when
they
have
been
interpreting
those
same
contracts
to
provide
those
payments,
they
are
not
expanding
insurance
coverage,
they
are
cutting
off
benefits
to
a
group
of
competitors
that
they
view
as
a
competitive
threat,
and
that--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--between
the
physicians
who
control--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--the
contract?
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
developed
by
blue
shield
of
virginia.
yes,
sir.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
and
the
contract--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--no,
sir.
that
is
not
our
complaint.
our
complaint
charges
that
they
failed
to
make
payments
for
services
of
clinical
psychologists.
we
don't
even
plead
the
contract.
the
contract
is
not
even
before
this
court,
except
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
petitioners
have
inserted
it.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
yes,
sir.
they
never
changed
the
contract.
they
just
stopped
the
practice.
at
one
time
they
paid,
and--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--no,
sir,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
i
misunderstood
your
honor's
question.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
right,
your
honor.
absolutely
correct.
and
that's
the--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--if
they
put
in
their
contract
that
we
will
pay?
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
will
not
pay?
if
that
decision
was
an
act
that
reflected
an
antitrust
violation,
there
might
be
a
cause
of
action,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
they
might
not
say
that,
but
suppose
the
decision
to
put
a
clause
in
the
contract
occurred
in
this
way.
suppose
the
surgeons
decided
that
they
didn't
want
family
physicians
to
treat
warts
without
consulting
a
surgeon,
and
suppose
further
that
the
minutes
of
the--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--well,
i'm
talking
about...
the
people
who
make
up
the
language
in
these
contracts
are
the
physicians
who
control
blue
shield.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
they
made
the
decision
to
exclude--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--the--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--where
the
physicians
make
up
the
contract?
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
blue
shield
makes
up
the
contract.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
and
blue
shield
is
the
participating
physicians,
as
even
the
petitioners
say
in
their
brief.
it
is
a
collective
of
physicians,--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--as
the
agent
of
the
physicians,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
we
are
alleging
a
combination,
joint
action
to
restrain
trade
and
to
boycott
clinical
psychologists
from
direct
payments.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
the--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--the
conspiracy
is
the
member
physicians,
the
directors
of
blue
shield,
and
the
two
blue
shield
plans
that
collaborated
together
later
to
also--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--reinforce...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
the
only
issue
before--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
exactly
the
same.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
she
would
still
have
standing.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
theoretically,
that
is
possible,
your
honor.
the
only
difficulty
with
that
is,
most
of
these
health
care
policies
are
part
of
your
fringe
benefit
as
an
employee,
and
very
few
people
have
the
resources
to
go
out
and
make
an
independent
purchasing
decision.
they
take
the
policy--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--if
she
bought
a
policy
and
part
of
the
policy
reflected
an
antitrust
violation,
and
she--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--she
would
have
standing
if
in
fact
she
could
show
there
was
a
violation
or
this
stage
of
the
litigation,
plead
there
was
a
violation,
plead
causation,
and
in
fact
that
she
had
been
injured
by
the
violation,
by
reason
of
the
antitrust
laws.
she
would
have
standing,
and
i
think
that
is
really
the
only
issue
that
is
before
this
court
today,
because
of
the
question
how
the
mccarren-ferguson
issue
is
presented,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
issue
of
standing
to
sue
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
just
by
way
of
summary,
we
think
that
her
complaint
on
its
face
alleges
sufficient
facts
to
demonstrate
the
likelihood
that
she
has
been
injured
by
an
antitrust
violation,
and
to
cut
off
her
lawsuit
at
this
early
stage
would
defeat
two
key
purposes
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
compensation
to
victims
and
deterrence
of
practices
which
hinder
competition,
without
her
ever
having
a
full
day
in
court.
second--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--your
honor,
i
think
that
although
the
supreme
court
has
never
really
addressed
the
issue
of
standing
to
sue
within
the
special
context
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
that
the
test,
or
at
least
the
stringency
of
the
application
of
the
test
might
well
differ.
as
esteemed
counsel
mentioned
earlier
in
his
argument,
he
relies
on
the
brunswick
case
to
define
the
concept
of
antitrust
injury.
that
came
up
after
a
full
trial
on
the
merits,
not
at
the
preliminary
stage
of
moving
to
dismiss
a
case
where
the
ability
to
show
the
relationship
of
the
injury
to
the
anticompetitive
practice
has
not
even
been
fleshed
out
by
discovery,
by
not
even
a
summary
judgment
hearing.
so,
yes,
i
do
suggest
that,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--i
think
if
the
plaintiff
alleges...
i
think
that
is
a
threshold
requirement,
an
allegation
of
an
antitrust
violation,
an
allegation
of
cause
and
fact,
and
there
has
to
be
somehow
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
i
would
suggest,
at
least
a
possible
relationship
in
terms
of
the
injury
to
competition
and
the
injury
that
was
inflicted
on
her.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
i
think
that
the
statute
on
its
face
would
allow
that
case
to
go
forward,
at
least
into
a
factual
investigatory
stage.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
i
think
that
most
of
the
courts
that
have
dealt
with
that
have,
and
you
are
speaking
to
one
category
of
antitrust
standing,
the
so-called
landlord
cases
under
the
direct
injury
test,
i
think
the
courts
have
usually
cut
off
injury
there,
or
the
right
to
assert
injury
because
of
the
possibility
of
duplicative
recovery.
i
suggest
that
we
don't
have
those
facts
here,
but
i
would
have
to
say
the
statute
on
its
face
is
broad
enough
to
allow
that,
to
allow
the
case
to
go
forward.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
is
just
a
fight
between
the
psychologists--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--i
believe
that
it
is
a
situation
where,
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
health
care
reimbursement
plan
here,
the
injury
inflicted
on
ms.
mccready
was
an
integral
part
of
an
effort
by
the
blue
shield
physicians
to
cut
off
competition
from
competing
non-m.
d.
health
care
providers,
and
if
i
could--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--well,
they
have
already
prevailed
in
a
case
in
which
the
court
has
denied
certiorari,
your
honor.
that
is
the
vacp
case.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that
case
held
that
the
joint
action
by
the
defendants,
the
blue
shield
defendants
in
this
identical
time
frame
to
withdraw
payment
and
to
exclude
clinical
psychologists
from
direct
payment
for
their
services
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
your
honor,
the
two
cases
proceeded
together,
and
in
fact,
in
the
district
court's
decision,
which
i
believe
is
in
the
appendix,
the
standing
challenge
was
made
to
the
psychologists.
judge
bryan
allowed
them
to
go
forward,
and
at
the
same
time...
in
fact,
in
the
same
order,
dismissed
ms.
mccready's
complaint
for
lack
of
standing.
so
they
actually
were
proceeding
simultaneously,
until
the
district
court
ruled.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
not
to
this
case,
because
this
is
the
treble
damage
case
asserted
by
a
subscriber
who
has
been
denied
her
reimbursement
benefits.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
concede
that.
i
would--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--i
don't
think
that
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
by
its
terms
would
exclude
that
case.
i
don't
think
ms.
mccready's
case
is
the
same.
i
think
just
as
the
fourth
circuit
found
below,
the
injury
inflicted
on
her
is
direct.
in
the
landlord
case,
you
have
indirect
injury,
and
courts
have
dismissed
those
because
they
are
indirect
or
remote
or
fortuitous,
all
the
kinds
of
language
that
the
courts
have
traditionally
used
when
they
wanted
to
cut
back
on
the
ambit
of
liability
to
which
a
defendant
is
exposed,
even
though,
a,
a
violation
has
been
proved,
and
b,
cause
and
fact
has
been
established.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
language
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
and
why
i
think
that
it
cannot
be
construed
so
narrowly
in
the
circumstances
that
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
done.
i
wanted
to
make
certain
at
the
outset
that
we
recognize
that
the
standing
concept
here
is
a
special
one.
we
are
not
talking
about
standing
in
the
sense
of
article
iii
and
whether
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
that
is
justiciable
where
someone
has
a
stakehold
in
the
outcome.
this
is
clearly
a
special
kind
of
antitrust
standing
which
would,
if
adopted,
certainly
if
the
petitioner's
rule
would
be
accepted,
would
limit
actions
in
the
federal
courts
for
federal
causes
of
action
which
reflect
important
federal
policy.
because
the
limitation
would
involve
an
imposition
of
a
judicial
restriction
on
the
exercise
of
congressional
power,
the
apparent
exercise
of
congressional
power,
we
believe
it
is
very
important
to
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute
in
order
to
make
certain
that
a
restrictive
reading
is
justified.
the
statute
itself
says
that
any
person
who
shall
be
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws
may
sue
in
the
district
courts
and
recovery
threefold
his
damages
plus
reasonable
cost
of
suit
and
attorneys'
fees.
the
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
if
the
landlord
has
a
financial
injury,
and
he
can
prove
the
nexus
between
that
financial
injury
and
an
antitrust
violation--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--the
statute
on
its
face,
your
honor,
is
broad
enough
to
allow
that
recovery,
and
the
question
this
court,
i
am
sure,
wants
is
whether
the
lower
court
decisions
restricting
that
should
be
the
rule
of
this
court.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
this
has
bothered
the
lower
courts.
in
a
series
of
what
i
would
call
pigeonhole
cases
they
have
developed
categories
that
would
restrict
particular
plaintiff,
the
shareholder
exception--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--i
think
the
statute
has
to
be
read
in
terms
of,
first,
its
language,
and
second,
the
legislative
history
and
its
purpose.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
we
would
argue
that
you
allow
everyone
to
recover
who
is
injured...
well,
first
we
argue
you
would
allow
everyone
at
least
to
proceed
with
his
case
past
the
12(b)(6)
stage
who
alleges
that
he
has
been
injured
by
reason
of--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--unless
allowing
him
to
proceed
would
defeat
antitrust
policy
rather
than
promote
it,
and
this
is
where
i
think
the
brunswick
case
would
come
into
play
as
a
possible
rational
reading
of
the
statute
to
impose
by
the
judiciary
a
limit
on
the
ambit
of
liability,
but
the
statute
was
designed
to
deter
violations,
and
the
statute
was
designed
to
see
that
people
who
had
been
injured
because
of
those
violations
recover.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not,
because
i
think
the
illinois
brick
case
reflects
a
decision
to
cut
off
the
risk
of
duplicative
recovery
and
administrative...
the
administrative
impossibility
of
trying
to
trace
damages
through
successive
chains.
this
case--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--absolutely,
your
honor.
we
have
a
direct
injury.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
we
believe--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--we
believe
that
our
client
would
prevail
under
any
of
the
three
tests
that
the
lower
courts
have
developed
in
their
struggle
to
limit
the
breadth
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
she
is
within
the
target
area,
as
the
fourth
circuit
correctly
held.
she
has
an
immediate
direct
injury.
it
is
not
derivative.
it
is
not
fortuitous.
and
finally,
she
is
a
reasonably
foreseeable
plaintiff,
which
is
a
short
of
hybrid
test
that
some
other
courts
have
adopted.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
i--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--you
could
define
it
that
narrowly,
your
honor,
but
if
you
did,
i
think
a
whole
class
of
people
who
have
suffered
a
very
real
financial
injury
would
not
be
allowed
to
recover,
and
defendants
might
very
well
be
able
to
profit
because
they
would
not
have
been
given...
forced
to
give
up
the
entire
pie
of
their
antitrust
violation,
and
since
congress
has
said
they
are
supposed
to
give
it
up
plus
treble,
i
don't
think
we
should...
i
certainly
don't
want
to
endorse
a
restriction
that
would
allow
defendants
to
keep
part
of
the
illicit
gains
from
the
antitrust
violation.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
he
could
recover,
but
as
the
fourth
circuit
found--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
still--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--no,
sir,
because
the
people
who
lose
patients
have
a
claim.
in
this
case,
mccready
stayed
with
her
psychologist
because
that
was
the
therapist
of
her
choice.
he
got
paid
completely.
she
is
out
of
docket
the
money
for
the
antitrust
violation,
and
the
reason
she
is
out
of
pocket,
you
have
to
understand
how
the
health
care
practice
works.
under
the
major
medical
policy,
the
patient
pays
the
provider
and
then
files
a
reimbursement
claim,
and
depending
on
the
different
circumstances,
it
could
be
an
80-20
percent
split.
in
order
to
limit
the
threat
of
these
allied
health
care
providers
which
is
documented
in
the
vacp
case,
the
blue
shield
board
and
physicians
had
to
impose
a
restriction
on
reimbursement.
otherwise,
if
they
didn't
impose
the
restriction,
she
would
have
gone
to
her
provider,
she
would
have
paid
him,
there
would
have
been
no
impetus
to
cut
down
on
people
going
to
independent
practice
in
clinical
psychology.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
that
would
be
a
harder
case,
but
fortunately--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--it
would
been
harder
case,
because
if
they
went
to...
if
i
understood
your
question...
to
the
banks
and
simply
combined
to
put
economic
pressure
to
deny
loans
to
psychologists--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--where
would
there
be
an
injury
to
her?
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
because
the
very
instrumentality
used
to
achieve
that
were
all
the
subscribers
who
were
entitled
to
the
benefit.
they
used
them
as
vehicles
to
deliver
antitrust
punch,
and
that
is
about
as
direct
an
injury
as
you
could
possibly
imagine.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
plan,
and
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
found
below.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
correct,
and
then
they
lost
business
in
the
process.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
address
that
in
our
brief,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
that
in
fact
this
was
known.
the
practice
was
to
pay.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
she
had
every
reason
to
expect
that
she
would
be
paid,
and
her
employer,
as
a
political
subdivision
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
had
every
reason
to
expect
that
blue
shield
would
have
obeyed
the
state
statute
that
also
required
payment
at
that
time.
so,
there
is
no...
there
is
nothing
in
this
record...
of
course,
the
case
only
comes
up
on
a
complaint.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
well,
it
might
be
a
defense
in
the
case.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
like
mccarren-ferguson
might
be--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--months
down
the
road
when
the
facts
are
developed,
but
it
certainly
isn't
a
defense
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding.
to
try
to
sum
up
on
this
part
of
the
argument,
she
meets
all
of
the
classic
tests
that
the
lower
courts
have
imposed
of
antitrust
standing.
to
cut
off
her
complaint
at
this
early
stage
of
the
proceeding
would
serve
no
important
federal
purpose.
there
are
no
reasons
to
cut
the
complaint
off
now.
there
would
be
no
double
recovery,
as
in
the
landlord
case
possibility,
no
complex
problems
of
proof
or
apportionment
of
damages,
and
proceeding
with
her
case
would
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
competition
in
the
health
care
market.
allowing
her
case
to
go
forward
would
ensure
at
least
the
possibility
of
compensation
to
her,
and
would
discourage
defendants
from
adopting
restrictive
practices
which
could
ultimately
if
successful
exclude
psychologists
by
making
it
too
expensive
for
subscribers
to
consult
them.
so
that
we
believe
that
if
the
court
has
to
harmonize
any
kind
of
restriction
rule
at
all
on
the
language
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
as
per
brunswick,
it
simply
should
be
that
we
shouldn't
allow
an
antitrust
plaintiff
to
go
forward
as
possibly
in
brunswick
where
actually
the
recovery
of
damages
would
tend
to
defeat
competition
rather
than
promote
it.
here,
by
making
her
whole
and
making
the
defendants
stop
their
practice
of
refusing
to
pay
her,
we
also
encourage
competition,
and
in
that
light,
she
certainly
should
be
allowed
to
go
forward.
now,
i
want
to
just
very
quickly
speak
to
the
mccarren-ferguson
act
exemption.
we
allege
a
boycott.
that
is
sufficient
under
barry
to
proceed.
more
importantly,
even
if
the
business
of
insurance
was
an
issue
here,
it
certainly
cannot
come
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
there
is
nothing
in
mccready's
complaint
that
talks
about
underwriting
of
risk,
distribution
of
risk,
or
insurance
contracts,
and
if...
under
royal
drug,
if
the
defendants
want
to
demonstrate
that
their
decision,
which
we
say
was
simply
an
antitrust
conspiracy,
was
in
fact
an
insurance
decision,
they
have
the
affirmative
obligation
of
proving
that
in
a
plenary
proceeding.
there
is
nothing
in
the
complaint
that
allows
them
to
even
make
that
argument.
therefore,
the
mccarren-ferguson
act
exemption
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
think
the
case
must
be--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--well,
your
honor,
the
certiorari
grant
was
not,
as
i
understand
it,
confined
to
any
issue.
both
of
the
issues
have
been
raised,
as
i
recall.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
so
the
certiorari
grant
was
not
defined
in
that
respect.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
we
think,
insofar
as
the
grant
did
deal
with
the
mccarren-ferguson
act,
it
is
improvident--
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
warwick
r.
furr,
ii
that's
right.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
be
the
position
we
would
take.
thank
you
very
much.
