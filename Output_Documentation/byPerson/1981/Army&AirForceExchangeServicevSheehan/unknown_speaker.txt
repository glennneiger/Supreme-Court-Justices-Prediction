unknown
speaker
what
theory
do
you
think...
which
of
those
two
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
on
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
do
we
have
to
remand
the
case
so
that
a
hearing
can
be
held
on
whether
there
was
an
appointment
or
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
you
say
introduced
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
employed
by
contract.
didn't
this
case
go
off
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
or
was
it
actually
tried?
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
don't
ordinarily
introduce
evidence
until
you
get
to
at
least
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
where
you
would
file
affidavits
and
so
forth,
or
unless
you
get
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
may
regret
it
if
he
does.
unknown
speaker
there
is
in
this
case,
as
i
remember,
isn't
there
a
claim
also
for
reinstatement
on
a
different
theory
than
the
tucker
act,
which
is
pending
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
and
in
that...
under
your
view
of
the
equitable
relief
that
could
be
granted
in
connection
with
the
reinstatement
case,
could
that
include
back
pay
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
this
relate
to
the
legal
question
we
have
before
us?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
allege
that
in
your
complaint?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
conclusion,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
paragraph
18
you
allege
that
the
actions
of
the
commander
violated
aafes
regulations
and
plaintiff's
right
to
a
free
and
impartial
appeal.
and
then,
they
violated
due
process.
now,
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
an
allegation
of
an
implied-in-fact
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
because
he
may
have
been
given
more
procedural
safeguards
and
protection
than
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
as
an
appointee,
that
that
somehow
alters
the
relationship?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
if
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
is
correct,
then
apparently,
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims
would
have
jurisdiction
over
any
personnel
matter
covered
by
the
regulations.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
would
you
limit
your
theory
just
to
discharge
procedures
or
to
all
phases
of
employment
by
these
people?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
that
you're
relying
on
use
of
the
federal
regulations
as
creating
this
implied
contract,
isn't
it
really
an
implied-in-law
contract,
if
there
be
a
contract
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
no
way
of
distinguishing
then
your
client's
case
from
the
case
of
any
other
federal
employee,
is
there?
because
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
he
had
some
special
understanding
with
respect
to
the
regulations,
that
other
employees
don't
have.
unknown
speaker
what
conduct
do
you
rely
on
for
the
implied-in-fact
contract?
unknown
speaker
are
those
cases
decided
by
this
court?
unknown
speaker
where
were
they
decided?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
if
your
theory
is
correct,
aren't
you,
in
effect,
providing
then
that
the
discharge
regulations
of
the
agency,
in
effect,
have
overruled
the
congressional
back
pay
act?
unknown
speaker
precisely.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
your
theory
that
anytime
there
are
regulations
it
means
there's
an
implied
contract
really
have
made
the
decision
in
testan
quite
beside
the
point,
because
there
were
regulations
there.
and
if
they
had
simply
sought
to
proceed
on
an
implied
contract
theory,
presumably
they
would
have
everything
going
for
them
that
your
client
has
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
had
recast
their
complaint
without
changing
any
of
the
facts,
simply
to
say
that
we
also
have
an
implied
contract
because
there
were
personnel
regulations
involved,
should
testan
have
gone
the
other
way
if
they'd
done
that?
unknown
speaker
did
you
mean
the
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
the
petitioner
is
stating
your
pleadings
are
deficient?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
present
rule
8?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
don't
think
we're
bound
by
rule
8
in
the
time
of
justice
holmes.
unknown
speaker
we've
had
amendments
since
then.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
ought
to
give
us
the
cites
rather
than
just
the
names.
unknown
speaker
is
that
judge
harlan's?
unknown
speaker
you
still
haven't
given
us
the
cite
for
judge
harlan.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
in
your
reinstatement
case
you
may
not
get
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
on
that?
supposing
in
the
next
case
that
comes
along,
the
plaintiff
alleges
the
facts
that
are
in
this
case,
and
then
in
addition
has
a
paragraph
in
which
he
says,
the
day
i
was
hired,
i
asked
the
hiring
officer
if
they
followed
their
regulations
and
the
man
said
yes,
i
do.
and
he
said
fine,
i'll
be
glad
to
work
for
you
then.
would
that
be
a
different
case?
