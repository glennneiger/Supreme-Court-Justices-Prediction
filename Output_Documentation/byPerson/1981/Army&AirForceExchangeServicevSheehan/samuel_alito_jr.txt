mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
where
a
former
employee
of
a
military
exchange
who
was
appointed
to
his
position
and
subsequently
discharged
may
sue
for
money
damages
under
the
tucker
act
based
upon
an
alleged
contract,
the
existence
of
which
is
inferred
solely
from
personnel
regulations
in
effect
at
the
time
of
his
separation.
the
basic
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows.
in
1962
the
respondent,
arthur
sheehan,
was
appointed
to
a
position
with
the
army
and
air
force
exchange
service,
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
the
regulations
governing
mr.
sheehan's
employment
by
the
army
and
air
force
exchange
service,
aafes
as
it
is
called,
were
the
very
same
regulations
considered
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
hopkins
in
1976.
in
1967,
five
years
after
his
initial
employment,
mr.
sheehan
was
designated
by
the
commander
of
aafes
for
participation
in
a
special
program
for
aafes
executives,
called
the
executive
management
program.
under
that
program,
he
obtained
certain
special
benefits,
but
also
incurred
certain
special
obligations;
principally,
the
possibility
of
transfer
to
any
aafes
facility.
he
was
required
to
sign
a
written
acknowledgement
of
the
special
conditions
of
executive
management
program
participation.
by
1975,
the
respondent
had
achieved
an
aafes
rank
equivalent
to
a
lieutenant
colonel.
in
november
of
that
year
he
was
arrested
on
drug
charges
and
subsequently
pleaded
guilty.
the
service
then
began
administrative
proceedings
which
resulted
in
his
discharge.
he
appealed
the
discharge
but
the
appellate
authority,
the
commander
of
aafes,
denied
the
appeal.
mr.
sheehan
then
sought
reconsideration
claiming
that
he
had
been
denied
a
fair
appeal
because
the
commander
of
aafes
who
acted
as
the
appellate
authority
had
given
prior
approval
for
the
initial
discharge
notice.
as
a
result
of
that
complaint,
mr.
sheehas
was,
in
effect,
granted
a
new
appeal
to
the
next
higher
authority
in
the
service,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
aafes.
his
appeal,
however,
was
once
again
denied.
in
the
meantime,
he
had
initiated
suit
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
seeking
reinstatement
as
well
as
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
he
claimed
that
aafes
had
violated
its
own
regulations
because
of
the
dual
role
played
by
the
commander.
he
also
claimed
that
his
discharge
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
an
abuse
of
discretion,
unwarranted
by
the
facts
and
in
violation
of
various,
unspecified
statutory
and
constitutional
provisions.
notably,
his
complaint
did
not
allege
that
he
had
ever
been
employed
pursuant
to
any
contract
with
aafes,
whether
express
or
implied.
he
invoked
the
court's
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act
and
various
other
statutes
not
now
at
issue.
the
service
moved
to
dismiss
his
complaint
noting
that
he
had
been
an
appointed,
non-contract
employee.
in
response,
he
did
not
seek
to
amend
his
complaint
to
allege
the
existence
of
a
contractual
relationship,
nor
did
he
adduce
any
proof
whatsoever
that
he
had
ever
been
employed
pursuant
to
contract.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
held
that
jurisdiction
existed
with
respect
to
his
claims
for
monetary
relief
under
the
tucker
act
because
aafes
personnel
regulations
in
effect
at
the
time
of
his
discharge
were
by
themselves
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
what
the
court
called
a
collateral
implied-in-fact
contract
between
the
service
and
respondent.
the
court
also
held
that
there
was
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
his
claims
for
non-monetary
relief,
but
that
question
is
not
at
issue
here.
in
our
view,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
respondent's
claims
for
monetary
relief
is
clearly
wrong.
it
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
hopkins
and
testan.
it
is
a
patent
attempt
to
circumvent
the
decision
of
congress
excluding
employees
of
aafes
and
the
military
exchanges
from
the
coverage
of
the
back
pay
act,
which
is,
of
course,
the
provision
of
federal
law
providing
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
back
pay
claims
by
regular
federal
officials...
federal
employees,
i
should
say.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
also
contrary
to
basic
principles
of
contract
law,
and
if
the
court's
reasoning
were
widely
accepted
it
would
have
far-reaching
and
clearly
unacceptable
consequences.
the
basic
principles
governing
this
case
are
well-established
and
i
don't
believe
they
are
disputed
by
respondent.
the
united
states
is
immune
from
suit
unless
congress
consents.
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
expressed
rather
than
implied.
therefore,
a
valid
waiver
may
be
found
only
in
a
constitutional
provision,
statute
or
valid
regulation
that
confers
the
substantive
right
to
recover
money
damages
from
the
united
states,
or
in
a
lawful
contract,
obligating
the
united
states
to
pay
money.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
the
court
clearly
proceeded
on
the
contract
theory,
although
it
relied
purely
upon
regulations.
it
did
so
because
the
regulations
at
issue
do
not
create
the
right
to
recover
money
damages
in
court,
nor
do
the
statutes.
and
the
statutes
and
regulations
involved
are
the
very
ones
that
were
before
this
court
in
hopkins.
and
in
that
case,
they
were
not
found
to
supply
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so,
the
court
was
relegated
to
the
contract
theory.
but
in
finding
the
existence
of
a
contract,
it
relied
solely
on
regulations.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
court
was
wrong.
the
decision
in
this
case,
though,
as
justice
rehnquist's
question
points
out,
is
whether
or
not
mr.
sheehan
was
ever
employed
pursuant
to
contract.
and
as
i
said,
the
court
of
appeals
found
what
it
termed
a
collateral
implied-in-fact
contract.
but
that
simply
cannot
be
correct.
first,
it
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
hopkins.
in
hopkins,
as
here,
an
employee
of
aafes
brought
suit
under
the
tucker
act
for
money
damages,
claiming
among
other
things
that
his
discharge
violated
aafes
regulations
and
the
due
process
clause.
this
court
carefully
analyzed
the
regulations
governing
employment
by
aafes
and
concluded
not
that
all
aafes
employees
work
under
a
collateral
implied-in-fact
contract;
on
the
contrary,
the
court
concluded
that
most
aafes
employees...
in
fact,
almost
all
aafes
employees...
are
appointed
to
their
positions,
just
like
regular
federal
employees.
thus,
hopkins
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
also
inconsistent
with
aafes'
own
regulations,
even
though
the
court
relied
solely
on
those
regulations
in
reaching
its
conclusion.
aafes'
regulations...
again,
as
noted
in
hopkins,
expressly
prohibit
the
service
from
entering
into
an
employment
contract
with
one
of
its
employees.
yet,
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
was
that
even
if
the
commencement
of
mr.
sheehan's
employment
was
pursuant
to
appointment,
he
subsequently
or
simultaneously
entered
into
a
collateral
implied-in-fact
contract
embodying
aafes
discharge
regulations.
that
simply
can't
be
squared
with
the
aafes
regulations
as
interpreted
in
hopkins.
third,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
contrary
to
elementary
principles
of
contract
law.
the
court
purported
to
find
the
existence
of
a
contract
implied
in
fact.
but
it
is
clear
that
the
obligation
it
identified
was,
at
best,
a
contract
implied
in
law,
or
a
quasi-contract.
a
contract
implied
in
fact
is,
of
course,
a
real
contract;
it
is
an
agreement
between
the
parties,
it
is
based
upon
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
it
differs
from
other
contracts
only
in
that
its
existence
is
inferred
from
the
parties'
conduct
rather
than
being
expressed
in
words.
a
contract
implied
in
law,
on
the
other
hand,
is
not
a
true
agreement
between
the
parties;
it
is
merely
a
legal
obligation
imposed
by
a
court
for
the
purpose
of
doing
justice,
and
without
reference
to
the
parties'
intent.
here,
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
find
a
contract
implied
in
fact,
but
looked
to
no
facts
particular
to
this
case.
it
looked
solely
to
provisions
of
law,
aafes'
regulations.
the
court
did
not
look
to
anything
the
parties
had
said
or
done
or
thought
in
1962
when
mr.
sheehan
became
an
aafes
employee,
or
in
1967
when
he
entered
this
executive
management
program,
or
at
anytime
during
his
14
years'
tenure
with
the
service.
and
in
fact,
there
were
no
facts,
there
are
no
facts,
concerning
any
of
those
matters
in
the
record
because
mr.
sheehan
failed
to
allege
or
even
to
attempt
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
contract
when
this
case
was
in
district
court.
thus,
since
the
court
of
appeals
looked
solely
to
provisions
of
law
and
not
to
any
facts
particular
to
this
case,
it
must
follow
that
the
obligation
it
identified
was
a
contract
implied
in
law.
and
there
is
no
tucker
act
jurisdiction
for
such
obligations.
fourth,
the
implications
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
are
far-reaching,
and
would
clearly
be
unacceptable.
because
the
court
looked
solely
to
the
existence
of
personnel
regulations
in
effect
at
the
time
of
mr.
sheehan's
employment
and
discharge,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
mere
existence
of
personnel
regulations
at
the
time
of
a
government
employee's
appointment
or
during
his
tenure
is
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
employee
and
his
governmental
employer.
there
is
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
confining
its
logic
to
mr.
sheehan's
case,
as
opposed
to
that
of
any
other
aafes
employee.
there
is
nothing
in
the
decision
confining
its
reasoning
to
regulations
concerning
discharge
procedures,
as
opposed
to
any
other
personnel
regulations.
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
confining
its
reasoning
to
aafes
or
the
military
exchanges
or
the
non-appropriated
fund
instrumentalities
as
opposed
to
any
federal
department
or
agency.
and
thus,
under
the
court
of
appeals'
logic,
whenever
any
federal
employee
believes
that
any
federal
personnel
regulation
has
been
violated,
he
or
she
may
bring
suit
for
damages
under
the
tucker
act,
claiming
a
violation
of
a
so-called
collateral
implied-in-fact
contract.
that
result,
of
course,
would
be
inconsistent
with
hopkins,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
testan,
it
would
render
the
back
pay
act
superfluous,
and
it
would
eliminate
large
chunks
of
the
federal
government's
sovereign
immunity
without
congress'
consent.
mr.
sheehan's
briefs,
i
believe,
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
alternative
grounds,
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
was
unsound.
mr.
sheehan
asks
this
court
to
find
that
he
entered
into
an
express
or
an
implied
contract
when
he
entered
the
executive
management
program.
however,
as
i
noted,
he
failed
to
allege
or
even
to
attempt
to
prove
the
existence
of
this
express
or
implied
contract
when
the
case
was
in
district
court.
in
addition,
aafes
regulations,
as
i
noted,
forbid
the
agency
from
entering
into
an
employment
contract
with
one
of
its
own
employees.
now,
since
executives,
senior
executives,
entering
the
executive
management
program
are
already
aafes
employees,
it
must
follow
that
a
contractual
relationship
is
not
formed
upon
entry
into
that
program
or
the
regulation
would
be
routinely
violated.
third,
it
is
apparent
from
the
fact
of
the
regulations
concerning
the
executive
management
program,
that
a
contractual
relationship
is
not
created.
those
regulations
specify
that
one
enters
the
program
by
nomination,
selection
and
designation
rather
than
through
the
formation
of
a
contract.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
it
was...
the
burden
was
on
respondent,
who
was
the
plaintiff
below,
to
prove
the
existence
of
tucker
act
jurisdiction
when
the
case
was
in
district
court,
and
he
simply
failed
to
do
that.
he
did
not
allege
that
a
contract
existed,
and
he
did
not
adduce
any
facts
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
contract.
now,
he
argues
that
a
remand
should
be
ordered
because
one
was
given
in
hopkins,
but
the
situation
in
hopkins
was
significantly
different.
there,
the
employee
had
alleged
the
existence
of
a
contractual
relationship.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
he
was
a
contract
employee
because
under
that
court's
prior
precedence,
he
was
not
a
regular
federal
employee.
and
thus,
it
held
that
he
was
a
contract
employee
almost
as
a
matter
of
law.
hopkins,
for
that
reason,
had
no
occasion
to
introduce
in
the
court
of
claims
whatever
proof
he
might
have
had
that
he
was
a
contract
employee,
in
a
more
conventional
sense.
and
thus,
when
this
court
reversed
the
court
of
claims
and
rejected
its
reasoning
that
he
was
a
contract
employee
simply
because
he
was
not
a
regular
federal
employee,
it
was
appropriate
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
claims
so
that
hopkins
could
adduce
whatever
proof
he
might
have.
here,
mr.
sheehand
did
not
allege
the
existence
of
a
contract,
he
did
not
introduce
any
evidence
establishing
the
existence
of
a
contract,
and
he
had
the
clear
need
to
do
so,
to
substantiate
tucker
act
jurisdiction
which
was
what
he
claimed
in
the
district
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
it
was
not
tried,
your
honor,
it
went
off
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
when
jurisdiction
is
challenged
by
the
defendant
in
a
case
and
a
basis...
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
challenge
is
established...
and
that
was
done
here
because
i
think
mr.
sheehan
will
not
dispute
the
fact,
and
his
own
complaint
suggests,
that
he
was
an
appointed
employee
under
this
court's
analysis
of
the
regulations
in
hopkins.
once
jurisdiction
is
properly
challenged
by
the
defendant,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
plaintiff
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
those
facts
necessary
to
establish
the
court's
jurisdiction.
he
cannot
simply
rest
on
mere
conclusory
allegations.
and
here,
there
were
not
even--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--and
here
there
were
not
even
conclusory
allegations.
there
was
not
even
an
allegation
that
he
was
employed
pursuant
to
contract.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
alive
and
upon
remand,
the
district
court
may
order
his
reinstatement
if
it
feels
that
it's
appropriate.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
could
not
include
back
pay
because
there
has
not
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
that.
the
theory
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
that
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
claims
other
than
money
damages
was
waived
by
the
1976
amendment
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
since
his
claim
for
back
pay
would
be
a
claim
for
monetary
relief,
that
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
would
not
cover
those...
would
not
cover
that
claim.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
have
a
very
short
reply.
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
procedural
deficiencies
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
are
not
so
much
that
the
respondent
failed
to
utter
the
magic
word
"contract".
the
real
deficiency
is
that
he
failed
to
allege
any
facts
from
which
the
existence
of
a
contract
could
be
inferred.
and
when
the
government
properly
challenged
his
invocation
of
tucker
act
jurisdiction,
he
failed
to
allege
or
present
in
any
way
whatsoever
any
facts
which
would
show
the
existence
of
a
contract.
to
send
this
case
back
now
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
he
entered
into
a
contract
would
be
an
empty
exercise.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
sufficient,
your
honor.
it
is
expected
that
the
government
will
follow
its
regulations
with
respect
to
all
of
its
appointees,
and
the
mere
acknowledgement
that
it
will
abide
by
the
law
is
not
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
contractual
relationship.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
concerns
the
executive
management
program
that
respondent
has
stressed.
he
claims
that
he
entered
into
a
contract
because
he
was
required
to
sign
a
written
acknowledgement
of
the
conditions
of
entry
into
that
program.
and
as
i
mentioned
in
my
opening
argument,
there
are
certain
special
benefits
having
to
do
with
life
insurance
and
other
matters
of
that
type,
and
also,
certain
special
obligations.
principally,
the
possibility
of
transfer.
first
of
all,
simply
signing
such
an
acknowledgement
is
not
proof
of
a
contract.
many
other
federal
employees
who
certainly
do
not
work
under
contract
are
required
to
sign
similar
acknowledgements.
personnel
in
the
military,
for
example,
must
sign
enlistment
papers,
and
sometimes
agree
to
incur
special
obligations
such
as
an
extended
term
of
enlistment
in
exchange
for
special
benefits
such
as
a
preferred
assignment
or
training.
the
fact
that
they
sign
that
acknowledgement
doesn't
mean
they
have
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
army.
and
second,
even
if
those
special
conditions
of
the
executive
management
program
were
a
contract,
they
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
respondent's
claim
that
his
discharge
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
an
abuse
of
discretion,
et
cetera.
we
would
therefore
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
respondent's
claims
for
monetary
relief.
