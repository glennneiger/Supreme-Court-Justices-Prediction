mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ultimate
issue
to
be
decided
by
this
court
is,
do
the
regulations
of
the
army-air
force
exchange
service,
aafes,
as
they
apply
to
the
termination
of
employment
of
respondent,
constitute
part
of
an
implied-in-fact
contract
between
aafes
and
respondent,
to
confer
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act,
and
a
breach
of
which
implied-in-fact
contract
waives
sovereign
immunity
in
the
district
court.
the
allegations
in
plaintiff's
complaint...
in
the
respondent's
complaint
now...
on
file
is
critical
to
the
facts
and
determinations
by
this
court.
the
respondent
alleges
that
he
was
first
hired
in
1962
as
a
computer
programmer;
that
subsequent,
some
five
years
later,
he
was
accepted
into
a
program
known
as
the
executive
management
program,
commonly
called
emp.
the
emp
program
had
special
benefits
and
special
burdens,
and
these
are
all
alleged
in
the
complaint.
included
within
the
special
benefits
are
retention
priority,
longer
notice
requirements
for
separation,
which
is
the
procedure
for
termination
of
employment,
greater
insurance
benefits
and
supplemental
retirement
benefits.
the
emp
program
also
provided
for
special
obligations
including
the
obligation
to
develop
certain
abilities,
the
obligation
to
accept
worldwide
transfer,
and
the
obligation
to
accept
terms
of
fully
emp
retirement.
respondent
was
required
to
and
acknowledged
these
obligations
and
benefits
in
writing
pursuant
to
the
regulations
of
aafes.
for
the
next
eight
years,
respondent
served
as
an
emp
employee.
in
late
1975
respondent
was
arrested
off
duty,
away
from
the
premises
of
aafes,
for
violations
of
the
state
drug
law,
and
in
early
1976,
he
pled
guilty
to
four
misdemeanors
for
violations
of
state
drug
laws.
as
a
result,
the
commander
of
aafes
set
forth
an
investigation
pursuant
to
the
regulations
and
pursuant
to
these
very
regulations,
the
commander
gave
the
respondent
advanced
notice
of
separation.
an
investigation
was
then
commenced,
pursuant
to
the
regulations
and
as
required
by
the
regulations,
and
a
final
decision
to
terminate
the
employment
of
respondent
was
reached
in
april
of
1976.
notice
was
then
given
to
respondent,
pursuant
to
these
regulations.
respondent
contested
his
termination
and
appealed
it,
pursuant
to
these
regulations.
the
appeal
was
then
perfected
and
taken
in
accordance
with
the
regulations.
a
hearing
examiner
was
then
appointed
pursuant
to
the
regulations.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
your
honor,
it
is
in
fact
the
implied
contract
arises
from
the
understanding
between
the
parties,
a
tacit
understanding,
that
the
regulations
would
be
the
basis
for
the
termination
of
respondent,
and
further,
the
tacit
understanding
that
the
regulations
would
control
the
separation--
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
--your
honor,
according
to
the
rule
8
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
your
honor,
the
obligations
and
benefits
are
set
out
in
the
pleadings,
and
there
is
a
pleading,
your
honor,
to
the
effect
that
aafes
has
violated
respondent's
rights
and
violated
the
regulations
in
the
termination
of
respondent
from
his
job.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
your
honor,
that
is...
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
pleadings,
though,
that
substantiate
what
his
rights
are
and
that
the
aafes
commander
acted
as
both
the
separation
authority
and
the
termination
authority,
which
is
in
clear
violation
of
aafes
regulations.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
well,
your
honor,
under
the
notice
provisions
of
rule
8,
the
fifth
circuit
so
construed
that
as
a
breach
of
an
implied
contract.
and,
your
honor,
respondent
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
totality
of
the
pleadings
would
then
constitute
sufficient
pleadings
to
allege
a
violation
of
an
implied-in-fact
contract.
that
is
a
determination
made
by
the
fifth
circuit,
and
that's
a
determination
that
this
court
will
ultimately
have
to
make
in
this
case.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
to
this
court
that
the
emp
status
may
very
well
be
a
contract
between
the
aafes
and
the
respondent,
as
in
the
hopkins
case,
which
must
be
remanded
back
to
the
court
for
further
determination
of
the
facts.
yes,
your
honor.
during
the
appellate--
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
--your
honor,
in
the
facts
in
this
case,
respondent
is
alleging
that
there
was
an
implied-in-fact
contract
arising
out
of
the
regulations
solely
governing
the
termination
of
employment.
so,
yes,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
regulations,
then
the
government
agency
would
be
required
to
follow
its
regulations.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
your
honor,
the
discharge
procedures
are
at...
what
is
issue
before
this
court.
the
court
could
limit
it
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
although
counsel
would
argue
an
overall
policy
that
any
regulations
that
are
in
effect
could
be
alleged
to
be
breached,
and
therefore
give
rise
to
jurisdiction
in
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
correct
in
its
conclusion
that
it
was
an
implied-in-fact
contract.
the
tacit
understanding
that
existed
between
aafes
and
the
respondent,
that
the
regulations
would
be
the
basis
of
termination
and
that
they
would
be
followed,
constitutes
an
implied-in-fact
contract.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
your
honor,
there
is
allegations
to
the
effect
that
there
was
special
obligations
and
benefit
in
the
emp
program.
but
in
regards
to
termination,
your
honor,
the
court
may
very
well
construe
this
decision
broadly,
as
would
the
government
have
the
court
do
so.
in
response,
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
that
in
furtherance
of
your
answer,
the
law
is
well
settled
and
as
stated
by
justice
blackmun
in
the
court's
decision
in
morton
v.
ruiz,
where
the
rights
of
individuals
are
affected,
it
is
incumbent
upon
agencies
to
follow
their
own
procedures.
this
is
even
where
the
internal
procedures
are
possibly
more
rigorous
than
otherwise
would
be
required.
so
in
addition,
your
honor,
to
there
being
this
tacit
understanding,
there
is
also
well-established
law
which
says
that
federal
agencies
are
obligated
and
bound
to
follow
their
own
regulations.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
all
right.
your
honor,
as
i
was
stating
in
response
to
chief
justice
burger's
questions
concerning
why
does
all
of
the
procedures
and
regulations,
what
do
they
have
to
do
with
this
matter.
your
honor,
the
parties
followed
the
regulations.
there,
it
is
the
position
and
contentions
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
government,
that
aafes,
made
an
offer
by
setting
out
regulations
which
control
the
rights
and
protections
of
the
respondent
in
the
termination
procedure.
that
in
fact,
this
offer
was
accepted
in
three
parts.
it
was
accepted
when
he
entered
into
the
employment
with
the
understanding
that
the
government
would
follow
its
regulations;
when
he
continued
his
employment
after
he
acknowledged
in
writing
that
he
understood
these
regulations;
and
thirdly,
by
following
the
regulations
himself
in
the
appellate
process.
that
all
three
of
these
constitute
the
acceptance
of
the
offer
by
the
government
in
its
regulations.
and
then
the
final
element,
the
sine
qua
non,
the
consideration,
is
actually
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
which
are
accepted
by
both
parties
in
the
employment
relationship.
now,
there
is
case
law
in
which
a
number
of
cases
have
held
that
regulations
of
federal
agencies
do,
in
fact,
support
the
contention
that
there
is
an
implied-in-fact
contract
arising
out
of
the
regulations.
such
cases
include
augusta
aviation,
incorporated
versus
united
states,
aycock-lindsey
corporation
versus
the
united
states,--
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
--no,
your
honor,
none
of
these
cases
have
been
decided
thus
far
by
this
court.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
your
honor,
there
was
a...
the
aycock-lindsey
corporation
was
a
fifth
circuit
decision
which
is
cited
in
the
brief...
excuse
me,
in
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
present
case.
the
bodek
versus
department
of
treasury
case
was,
i
believe,
a
ninth
circuit
decision.
griffin
versus
united
states
was
a
court
of
claims
decision,
1978.
new
york
airways,
inc.
versus
united
states
was
a
court
of
claims
decision
in
1966.
radium
mines,
inc.
versus
united
states
was
a
court
of
claims
decision
in
1957.
spicer
versus
the
united
states
was
a
district
court
case
out
of
kansas
which
was
affirmed
by
the
tenth
circuit.
and
wolak
versus
the
united
states
was
a
district
court
of
connecticut.
all
of
these
cases
have
held
that
there
was,
in
fact,
an
implied-in-fact
contract
arising
out
of
regulations
with
a
federal
government
agency.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
no,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
that
perhaps
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
get
in
through
the
back
door
which
i
couldn't
get
in
through
the
front
door--
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
--your
honor,
that
question
was
addressed
by
this
court
itself
in
the
hatzlachh
decision,
hatzlachh
versus
united
states,
whereby
this
same
argument
was
made
and
the
court
said
that
you
should
look
to
the
theory
presented
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
that
it
is
no
concern
of
this
court,
front
door
or
back
door.
if
there
is
a
valid
contention
by
the
respondent
the
court
should
address
that
issue.
and
i
believe
that
justice
blackmun
in
his
concurring
opinion,
as
i
recall,
in
that
case,
he
discussed
the
implied-in-law
versus
implied-in-fact
theory.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
hatzlachh
versus
united
states
decision,
which
is
440
united
states
460,
may
very
well
answer
the
concerns
of
your
honor
in
her
question
to
me.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
the
testan
decision,
your
honor,
is
totally...
the
petitioner's
contentions
that
testan
is
applicable
is
totally
erroneous
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
your
honor,
in
testan,
this
was
an
action
brought
by
two
government
lawyers
seeking
reclassification
from
gs-13's
to
gs-14's,
and
for
back
pay
during
the
period
of
misclassification.
they
sought
jurisdiction
of
this
court
under
the
tucker
act,
but
they
did
not
seek
waiver
of
immunity
based
upon
implied
contract
or
contract.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
i
believe
justice
blackmun
gave
the
hint
to
that
in
his
decision
when
he
said...
and
if
i
may
quote
from
two
parts
of
that,
justice
blackmun
stated,
"the
respondent
did
not
rest
their
claim
upon
contract.
"
that's
at
424
u.s.
399.
"in
addition",
justice
blackmun
wrote,
"the
present
action,
of
course,
is
not
one
concerning
a
wrongful
discharge
or
a
wrongful
suspension.
"
i
submit
to
the
court
that
those
are
clear
indications
that
had
the
respondent...
that
those
are
clear
indications
had
the
respondent
so
represented
or
so
rested
his
case
upon
contract
or
implied
contract,
that
the
decision
may
have
very
well
been
differently.
or,
the
opinion
may
have
gone
for
the
respondent
in
that
case.
i
think
that
those
two
statements
not
only
distinguish
testan
but
clearly
support
the
position
of
respondent
before
this
court
today.
i
would
also
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
of
the
court's
time
and
direct
remarks
to
u.s.
versus
hopkins,
which
the
attorney
for
petitioner
contends
is
controlling.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
u.s.
versus
hopkins
is
not
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
case
presently
before
this
court.
in
hopkins,
this
case
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
court
of
claims
decision,
the
lower
case,
the
lower
court
in
hopkins,
and
a
recent
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
young
versus
united
states.
the
conflict
resulted
in
that
the
court
of
claims
in
hopkins
had
held
that
the
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act
was
sufficient
to
hear
claims
against
aafes
by
an
employer
on
a
breach
of
the
implied
contract.
whereas,
the
fifth
circuit,
in
young
versus
the
united
states,
had
concluded
that
the
tucker
act
did
not
extend
jurisdiction
to
those
particular
claims.
the
court
of
claims
in
its
lower
court
holding
held
that,
or
relied
upon
its
earlier
decision
of
keetz
versus
the
united
states.
in
keetz,
the
court
of
claims
had
held
that
aafes
employees
were
not
federal
employees,
and
therefore,
did
not
serve
by
appointment
but
served
by
contract.
the
keetz
decision
was
a
pre-1970
amendment
case,
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
keetz
the
united
states
government
was
vigorously
contending
that
aafes
employees
serve
by
contract.
however,
after
the
1970
amendment,
the
goverment
has
taken
a
contrary
position
and
now
argues
that
he
serves
by
appointment.
hopkins
could
have
answered
the
question.
this
court
remanded
the
case
for
the
determination,
did
hopkins
serve
by
appointment,
or
did
he
serve
by
a
contract?
the
case
was
settled
prior
to
the
determination
by
the
court
of
claims,
and
therefore,
that
question
still
remains
unanswered.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
even
if
hopkins
had
been
decided
that
in
fact
he
served
by
appointment,
which
i
do
not
and
am
not
willing
to
concede
in
my
argument
today
before
this
court,
but
even
if
it
had
decided
that
hopkins
served
by
appointment,
it
would
not
be
controlling
in
this
case
because
in
the
instant
case,
mr.
sheehan,
the
respondent,
was
an
emp
employee.
and
if
you
use
the
logic
of
the
hopkins
decision,
then
this
court
should
remand
the
case
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
an
emp
employee
serves
by
contract
or,
in
fact,
is
also
an
appointed
employee.
i
think
the
language
in
hopkins
is
clear
that
this
court
should
not
make
that
decision
without,
as
the
court
says,
a
development
of
a
fuller
record.
i
received
last
thursday
afternoon
in
the
mail
a
reply
brief
from
the
government,...
and
i
would
not,
or
i
would
object
to
such
late
filing...
whereby
the
respondent
appears
to
be
pleading
that,
or
stating
that
my
pleadings
were
deficient.
i
would
point
out--
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
yes,
your
honor,
that
the
petitioner
has
contended
that
respondent's
pleadings
were
deficient.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
siegelman
versus
canard-whitestar
wherein
judge,
later
justice,
harlan
stated
under
rule
8,
a
pleading
must
contain
a
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
claim,
showing
the
pleader
is
entitled
to
relief.
it
is
not
necessary
to
set
out
legal
theories
on
which
the
claim
is
based.
in
a
more
recent
case,--
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
--yes,
your
honor.
in
a
more
recent
decision,--
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
yes,
your
honor,
you
are
correct,
but
the
recent
cases
still
support
and
still
quote
from
this
language.
in
speed
auto
sales
versus
amc,
which
is
a
1979
decision,
granted
it's
out
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
it
said,
under
federal
notice
pleadings,
it
is
unnecessary
to
set
out
the
legal
theory
upon
which
a
claim
is
based.
thus,
while
it
is
desirable
that
the
pleadings
give
notice
of
some
theory
supporting
recovery,
it
is
unnecessary
for
the
pleader
to
delineate
the
theories
or
choose
among
alternate
theories
of
relief.
mr.
ira
e.
tobolowsky
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
in
speed
auto
sales,
inc.
versus
american
motor
corporation
it's
477
fed
sup
1193.
in
addition,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
2(a)
moore's
federal
practice,
section
8.14
