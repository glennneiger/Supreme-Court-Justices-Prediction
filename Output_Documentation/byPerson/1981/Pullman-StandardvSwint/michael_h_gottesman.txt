mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case,
like
the
last
one,
involves
the
question
whether
a
seniority
system
is
protected
by
section
703(h),
but
the
issues
that
are
before
this
court
are
entirely
different.
this
is
a
pre
act
system.
no
one
disputes
that
it
is
a
seniority
system.
and
indeed,
no
one
disputes
that
the
ultimate
outcome
of
this
case
turns
on
the
resolution
of
a
single
dispositive
question
of
fact,
that
is,
whether
this
system
was
negotiated
or
maintained
with
a
discriminatory
purpose.
the
issues
that
are
before
this
court
relate
not
to
the
meaning
of
703(h)
as
such.
that
is
something
which
is
common
ground
in
both
lower
courts
and
with
all
the
parties
in
amici,
but
rather,
with
the...
the
respective
roles
of
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
in
making
the
factual
determination
of
discriminatory
purpose,
and
with
a
methodology
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
sought
to
impose,
both
on
the
district
courts
and
on
itself,
for
treating
with
the
evidence
that
bears
on
the
resolution
of
that
factual
question.
now,
this
case
was
before
the
district
court
in
successive
trials
that
amounted
to
19
days,
in
which
his
focus
throughout
was
principally
on
the
seniority
system,
and
he
had
in
addition
to
19
days
of
testimony,
a
mass,
literally
a
mass
of
documentary
evidence,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
the
district
court
found
as
fact
that
the
seniority
system
in
this
case,
a
system
which
provided
that
departmental
seniority
would
be
the
measure
of
seniority
for
layoffs,
recalls,
and
promotions,
had
not
been
adopted
with
a
discriminatory
purpose,
and
had
not
been
maintained
with
a
discriminatory
purpose,
and
he
cited
a
number
of
subsidiary
findings,
if
you
will,
that
led
him
to
that
ultimate
conclusion.
first,
this
system
was
neutral
on
its
face,
made
no
distinction
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
was
in
fact
applied
equally
to
blacks
and
whites
throughout
its
existence.
second,
he
found
the
system
was
essentially
the
product
of
the
union's
aims
and
policies
at
that
plant,
not
the
company's.
he
found
that
at
each
stage
in
its
development
it
was
the
union
that
was
making
the
demands
for
particular
seniority
features,
and
that
the
features
that
emanated
from
bargaining
were
those
that
the
union
had
sought.
he
therefore
thought
it
particularly
important
to
look
at
the
attitudes
of
that
union
on
questions
of
race
and
the
roles
that
blacks
and
whites
respectively
played
within
that
union
in
determining
its
policy.
he
found
that
this
was
a
union
rather
unique
in
alabama
in
the
early
1940s
that
pursued
colorblind
objections...
objectives,
excuse
me.
he
found
that
the
work
force
at
this
particular
plant
was
roughly
half
black
at
all
times,
that
blacks
had
been
a
major
force,
indeed
the
major
force
in
organizing
the
union,
that
blacks
had
at
all
times
been
actively
involved
in
the
leadership
of
the
union,
holding
officer
positions,
holding
a
majority
of
the
shop
steward
positions,
that
blacks
at
all
times
had
been
on
the
union's
negotiating
committee,
had
participated
in
negotiating
the
very
seniority
system
in
question,
indeed,
had
proposed
many
of
the
very
elements
of
the
system
that
were
under
question
in
the
negotiation,
that
each
element
of
the
system
when
negotiated
was
brought
back
to
the
membership
for
approval
at
membership
meetings
in
which
blacks
and
whites
participated
equally,
both
in
speaking
about
the
system
and
in
voting
on
it,
that
the
votes
on
the
seniority
system
had
never
divided
along
racial
lines,
and
he
made
two
ultimate
conclusions
about
the
role
of
this
union
that
had
negotiated
this
system.
one,
this
was
not
a
local
dominated
by
whites
in
any
sense--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--by
two
units,
do
you
mean
the
plant
was
divided
into
two
bargaining
units?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
is
that
your
honor's
question?
the
union
was
not
divided
into
two
units.
the
steelworkers
union
was
one
union.
it
came
and
sought
to
organize
that
entire
plant.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
what
happened
was,
another
rival
union...
this
was
the
cio,
the
steelworkers
union.
they
came
and
said,
we
are
an
industrial
union,
we
want
to
organize
the
entire
plant.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
they
were
in
the
same
departments.
they
were
historically
not
in
the
same
jobs.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
the
company
assigned
blacks
to
some
jobs
and
whites
to
others,
and
it
was
this
seniority
system
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--permit
it?
no,
the
union
did
not
permit
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
union
negotiated
a
seniority
system
that
enabled
blacks
to
exercise
seniority
to
get
to
the
white
jobs.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
the
evidence
is
quite--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--pardon
me?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
they
stopped
it
before
the
effective
date
of
title
7,
and
they
stopped
it
with
this
very
seniority
system.
those
were
the
findings.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
sorry?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
the
union
walked
into
a
plant
in
which
the
company
had
discriminatorily
assigned
people
to
jobs
on
the
basis
of
race.
it
had
not
by
virtue
of
that
put
all
blacks
in
this
department
and
all
blacks
in
that
department.
departments
were
set
up
for
operational
purposes,
long
before
there
was
a
union,
long
before
there
was
a
seniority--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
wasn't
accidental
at
all,
your
honor.
the
company
for
racial
motivations
found
by
the
district
court
discriminatorily
assigned
people
to
jobs.
when
the
union
came
on
the
scene,
there
was
a
department.
that
department
had
jobs
with
black
people
on
them
and
it
had
jobs
with
while
people
on
them,
and
the
union
said,
we
want
a
departmental
seniority
system,
and
that
system,
when
they
got
it
and
when
they
finally
got
promotion
rights
under
it,
meant
that
blacks
on
a
job
where
the
company
had
put
them
because
they
were
black
could
now
exercise
their
seniority
to
promote
to
the
jobs
that
had
previously
been
assigned
to
the
whites.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely.
started
off,
because
the
company
assigned
them
different
jobs.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
they
ended
up
on
an
equal
footing,
your
honor.
that
is
the
important
thing,
because
since
departmental
seniority
was
the
measure,
the
time
that
a
black
had
spent
on
that
black
job
that
the
company
assigned
him
to
counted
just
as
much
as
the
time
that
a
white
spent
on
a
white
job.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no
seniority
ladder,
your
honor.
a
very
important
fact
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
sorry.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
you
are
entirely--
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
is
no
question
you
were
discriminated
against
before
the
passage
of
title
7.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
that
but
for
the
section
703(h)
and
the
decision
in
teamsters,
there
is
an
injury
suffered
by
people
by
reason
of
pre
act
discrimination.
it
happens
to
be
much
less
here
than
in
most
cases,
because
here
the
hypothetical
your
honor
gave,
that
you
were
eight
steps
below,
doesn't
exist.
here
there
were
no
lines
of
progression.
that
was
one
of
the
very
important
things
the
district
court
pointed
out
as
evidence
of
innocent
motivation.
here,
everyone
was
told,
promotions
from
now
on
within
this
department
will
be
on
the
basis
of
departmental
seniority,
without
any
lines
of
progression,
so
that
a
black
who
had
been
in
that
plant
longer,
even
though
he
had
been
assigned
to
the
bottom
job,
or
the
lowest
paying
job...
there
was
no
bottom
job
as
such
in
the
department...
would
be
free
to
use
that
seniority
to
claim
any
job
in
that
department
that
he
wished
the
minute
a
vacancy
arose.
in
other
words,
this...
the
design
of
this
system
was
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
positive
evidence
of
innocent
motivation,
because
although
many
people
for
non
discriminatory
reasons,
in
all
white
plants,
for
example,
where
race
couldn't
be
a
factor,
do
in
fact
develop
lines
of
progression.
there
is
nothing
inherently
vicious
about
lines
of
progression.
in
fact,
this
system
didn't
contain
those.
this
system
contained
a
much
quicker
route
of
access
to
repair
the
damage
that
had
been
wrought
by
the
company's
initial
acts
of
discrimination.
now,
beyond
these
features,
the
company
cited
two
others.
the
company
looked
at...
i
am
sorry,
the
district
court
looked
at
the
two
components
of
this
system
about
which
complaints
had
been
made.
the
first
of
those
was,
this
is
a
departmental
seniority
system.
the
measure
of
seniority
is
how
much
time
have
you
been
in
the
department,
and
the
plaintiffs
allege
that
the
court
should
find
that
the
parties'
choice
of
that
measure
of
seniority
was
badly
motivated.
and
the
court
said,
i
have
nothing
to
support
such
an
inference.
on
the
contrary,
every
plant
in
america
of
this
size
and
with
this
disparity
of
jobs
is
either
a
departmental
seniority
system
or
a
narrower
one.
the
only
kind
of
seniority
system
you
can
create
that
doesn't
have
the
effect
of
disparate
impact
when
a
company
has
previously
discriminated
in
assignments,
is
one
that
says,
from
now
on,
whenever
any
job
in
this
plant
opens
up,
no
matter
where
it
is,
it
will
go
to
the
most
senior
person
in
the
plant
who
bids
for
it.
now,
that
is
the
only
kind
of
system
that
doesn't
create
disparate
impact.
but
that
kind
of
system
didn't
exist
anywhere
in
america
in
a
large
plant.
it
didn't
exist
because
employers
couldn't
operate
a
plant
that
way.
they
would
be
playing
musical
chairs
every
day,
moving
everybody
around.
and
it
didn't
exist
because
employees
didn't
want
a
seniority
system
like
that.
there
would
be
no
stability
whatever
in
your
job.
you
wouldn't
know
from
day
to
day
where
you
were
going
to
work
in
the
plant.
so
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
the
only
kind
of
seniority
system
that
would
not
have
disparate
impact,
and
what
that
meant
was,
and
this
was
the
point
the
district
court
found
absolutely
most
important
in
his
analysis,
what
that
meant
was,
when
a
union
organized
a
plant,
a
large
plant
where
the
employer
had
historically
discriminated,
and
that
discrimination
was
still
manifested
in
the
placement
of
people
in
the
plant,
it
was
not
conceivable
that
innocently
motivated
parties
would
have
negotiated
a
system
that
would
not
have
disparate
impact.
to
choose
to
have
a
seniority
system
meant
that
you
were
going
to
have
a
system
that
had
disparate
impact.
now,
i
suppose
one
could
say,
well,
the
fact
that
these
parties
chose
to
have
a
seniority
system
of
any
kind
is
evidence
of
bad
motives.
if
they
hadn't
been
badly
motivated,
they
wouldn't
have
chosen
to
have
a
seniority
system.
but
we
know
that
can't
be
the
case.
this
court
has
said
seniority
systems
are
universal
in
american
industry.
every
union
upon
negotiating
every
plant,
the
first
thing
it
wants,
even
before
a
wage
increase,
is
a
seniority
system,
because
that
is
the
most
important
things
that
employees
want
for
job
equity.
and
it
is
not
possible
in
the
face
of
a
history
of
discriminatory
assignments
to
negotiate
however
innocently
a
seniority
system
that
doesn't
have
a
disparate
impact.
now,
it
happens
that
among
the
choices
that
innocently
motivated
people
in
plants
make,
if
you
look
at
all
white
plants
where
race
couldn't
be
a
factor,
in
the
north,
there
are
a
number
of
kinds
of
systems
people
could
adopt.
they
could
adopt
a
job
seniority
system
with
a
line
of
progression.
they
could
adopt
line
of
progression
seniority.
the
widest
kind
of
seniority
anybody
ever
adopted
anywhere
was
departmental
seniority
without
lines
of
progression,
the
very
thing
which
these
parties
negotiated
here,
right
in
1941.
so
these
parties
adopted
the
broadest
system
of
seniority
that
had
the
least
disparate
impact
of
any
conceivable
system
they
might
reasonably
have
been
expected
to
choose,
and
the
district
court
said,
how
can
i
find
bad
motive
when
i
find
these
parties
adopting
what
is
in
fact
the
broadest
possible
system
anybody
could
have
been
expected
to
adopt.
now,
that,
i
think,
indicates
what
is
the
danger
of
placing
undue
emphasis
on
evidence
of
disparate
impact
in
measuring
seniority
systems,
and
this
would
be
true
of
a
post
act
system
as
well,
if
the
union
came
along
tomorrow
and
organized
a
plant
that
still
had
the
effects
of
an
employer's
historical
discrimination.
simply
to
choose
to
have
a
seniority
system
is
to
create
something
that
will
have
disparate
impact.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
when
you
say
what
test,
he
said
the
question
before
me
is,
were
the
parties
motivated
by
a
racial
purpose.
that
was
his
test.
he
derived
that
test
from
teamsters,
and
foreseeability,
teamsters
eliminated
as
an
element
in
the
inquiry
foreseeability.
now,
it
is
always
true
if
a
union
comes
on
a
plant
that
has
had
disparate
assignments,
to
choose
to
have
a
seniority
system
will
foreseeably
have
a
disparate
impact,
but
what
teamsters
said
is,
that
the
is
the
very
thing
congress
wanted
to
protect
in
703(h).
it
knew
that
it
was
foreseeable
that
any
seniority
system
would
have
those
effects,
and
it
wanted
to
say,
because
it
wanted
to
protect
seniority
systems,
that
notwithstanding
that
it
was
inevitable
that
those
systems
would
have
that
effect,
we
want
to
protect
those
systems,
and
we
will
not
invalidate
them,
as
this
court
also
said
in
feeney,
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
context,
and
it
said
it
again
in
teamsters
in
the
title
7
context,
we
will
only
allow
the
invalidation
of
those
systems
that
were
set
up
because
of,
not
in
spite
of
their
disparate
impact.
so
that
if
you
find
that
these
parties
designed
the
system
for
the
purpose
of
hurting
blacks,
or
fencing
them
out,
or
whatever,
that
system
will
not
be
protected,
but
if
these
parties
with
innocent
purpose
set
up
the
same
seniority
system
they
would
have
set
up
if
everybody
were
white,
or
everybody
were
black,
that
is
to
say,
a
system
which
was
not
shaped
by
racial
purpose,
then
the
mere
fact
that
that
system
has
a
continuing
effect
because
of
the
company's
independent
discrimination
will
not
invalidate
that
system.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
have
told
them
that,
your
honor.
in
some
places,
as
this
court
knows,
we
have
done
a
lot
more.
we
have
negotiated
quotas
and
the
like.
but
the
law
certainly
did
not
require
us
to
do
that,
and
in
this
plant
that
was
not
done.
we
don't
tell
them
we're
sorry,
your
honor,
but
when
you
say
we
tell
them
we're
sorry,
this
seniority
system
as
the
district
court
found,
"has
been
negotiated
by
blacks
no
less
than
whites.
"
and
that
is
a
finding
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
dispute.
blacks
had
an
absolutely
equal
voice
in
this
system,
and
for
whatever
reason,
in
more
recent
years,
when
the
company
proposed
merging
lots
of
departments,
an
event
which
would
in
fact
have
created
the
opportunity
to
use
seniority
more
broadly,
the
record
evidence
is
undisputed,
and
the
district
court
found
that
was
unanimously
rejected
by
the
employees
with
the
efforts
to
reject
it
led
by
the
minority
employees,
who
said,
sure,
there
are
some
advantages,
and
increased
mobility,
but
there
are
also
disadvantages,
in
that
others
are
going
to
have
increased
mobility
vis
a
vis
us.
that
was
a
choice
made
by
all
the
employees,
not
for
racial
reasons.
it
was
made
by
blacks
and
whites
together,
because
this
is
the
seniority
system
they
thought
would
work
best
in
their
plant.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
and
it
reversed
saying,
we
find
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
purpose
here.
and
there
are
three
features
of
that
reversal
that
i
think
are
important
to
focus
on.
first,
while
all
the
parties
had
assumed
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
this
entire
system
that
the
steelworkers
negotiated
is
invalid,
the
choice
of
departmental
seniority,
departmental
structure.
that
is
certainly
what
they
said.
they
said,
the
system
is
invalid.
the
government
has
come
along
in
an
amicus
brief
and
said,
oh,
no,
that...
it
is
true
that
literally
that
is
what
it
seems
to
say.
that
can't
be
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
to
say,
because
the
reasoning
of
the
court
couldn't
possibly
get
you
that
far.
all
it
meant
to
say
is
that
that
tiny
component
of
the
system
which
was
impacted
by
this
other
union,
the
machinists,
racial
motivation
in
giving
24
jobs
to
the
steelworkers,
was
invalid.
nothing
else
is
invalid.
now,
whichever
of
those
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
committed
the
two
errors
that
we
have
brought
before
this
court
for
consideration.
first,
it
is
the
rule
of
the
fifth
circuit,
not
just
in
seniority
cases,
but
applied
in
title
7
cases
wherever
discriminatory
purpose
is
the
issue,
it
is
the
rule
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
rule
52a
does
not
apply
to
our
review
of
a
district
court
finding
on
discriminatory
purpose.
oh,
it
applies
to
the
subsidiary
findings.
if
this
court
found,
for
example,
that
blacks
participated
in
the
vote,
we
have
got
to
accept
those
findings
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous.
but
what
they
call
the
ultimate
fact,
and
what
i
would
say
when
discriminatory
purpose
is
the
dispositive
fact,
we
will
make
an
independent
factfinding
on
that
issue
free
of
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
now,
the
first
issue
we
have
brought
before
the
court
is...
and
this
court
granted
cert
on
this
last
year
in
berdeen
and
then
didn't
reach
it,
and
has
granted
cert
on
it
again
this
year...
the
first
thing
we
bring
before
this
court
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
usurping
powers
that
it
does
not
have
in
reviewing
factfinding.
nobody
is
here
to
defend
the
fifth
circuit.
neither
the
plaintiffs
nor
the
government
defends
their
assertion
that
rule
52(a)
doesn't
apply,
and
that
is
not
surprising,
because
this
is
not
an
open
issue
in
this
court.
this
court
has
four
times
held
that
when
motive
is
the
dispositive
factual
question
in
a
case,
the
court
of
appeals
must
review
that
finding
on
the
basis
of
rule
52(a).
two
of
those
were
fourteenth--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
we
identify
it
in
the
statement
which
appears
in
footnote
6
on
page
15(a),
in
which
they
are
quoting
from
another
of
their
cases.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
sorry.
this
is
the
union's...
there
are
two
appendices,
and
they
look
alike.
i
think
your
honor
has
the
company's.
and
this
is
the
one
that
says
united
steelworkers,
and
this
is
the
one
to
which
all
of
the
parties
have
cited
in
their
briefs.
it
is,
in
any
event,
footnote
6
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
i
think
it
is
going
to
be
easier
to
follow
since
all
the
parties
have
the
united
steelworkers
appendix.
in
footnote
6,
on
page
15(a),
the
court
first
says,
we
have
a
definite
conviction
here
that
a
mistake
has
been
made.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
those
are
the
words
of
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
then
they
say,
footnote.
the
footnote
says,
findings
of
fact
by
a
district
court
in
title
7
are
not
to
be
set
aside
unless
clearly
erroneous.
they
are
still
cooking.
they
are
still
saying
the
right
thing,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned.
but
then
it
begins
to
break
down,
because
they
proceed
to
say,
in
the
last
paragraph,
quoting
east
v.
romine,
they
proceed
to
recite
their
own
standard,
which
is,
while
we
are
bound
by
findings
of
fact
under
the
clearly
erroneous
rule,
if
there
are
subsidiary
issues
as
to
a
finding
of
discrimination
or
non
discrimination,
that
is
a
finding
of
ultimate
fact
in
reviewing
the
district
court's
findings.
therefore,
we
will
proceed
to
make
an
independent
determination
of
appellant's
allegations
of
discrimination,
though
bound
by
findings
of
subsidiary
fact
which
are
not
themselves
not
clearly
erroneous.
now,
they
said
it
here.
they
have
done
it
in
every
single
title
7
case
involving
discriminatory
purpose.
between
the
filing
of
our
opening
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
there
were
12
more
fifth
circuit
cases
saying
that
where
discriminatory
purpose
is
the
ultimate
question
of
fact,
we
do
not
apply
clearly
erroneous,
we
make
an
independent
determination.
and
it
is
clear
from
the
methodology
of
the
opinion
that
is
what
they
did.
they
recite
what
the
district
court
did
as
though
it
were
sort
of
interesting
history.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
they
would,
to
be
sure.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
they
would
at
some
point
say,
here
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
does
not
apply
to
the
ultimate
finding
as
they
call
it
of
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
they
have
applied
it
under
1983,
wherever...
at
least
wherever
discrimination
is
the
ultimate
fact.
in
theory,
the
principle
goes
broader.
it
is
wherever
there
is
an
ultimate
fact
which
you
find
from
subsidiary
fact.
in
any
event,
as
i
have
said,
this
court
has
four
times
said
the
contrary,
and
two
of
them
the
issue
was
racial
motivation,
wright
versus
rockefeller
and
the
dayton
school--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--in
the
fifth
circuit
or
to
the
fifth
circuit?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
not
sure
that
i
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
certainly
the
parties
said
the
test
here
is
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
hadn't
been--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--there
had
not
been
a
dozen.
this
came
early
in
the
game.
the
dozen
came
in
after.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
they
have
not
given
it
up.
oh,
i
am
sorry.
if
the
question
is,
has
anybody
cited
them,
i
am
sure
they
have.
but
they
have
not
given
it
up,
and
indeed
they
are
playing
it,
as
i
say,
a
dozen
cases
between
opening
brief
and
reply
brief.
every
title
7
discriminatory
purpose
case
is
being
found
this
way.
now,
nor
is
it
an
answer
that,
well,
some
cases
are
documentary.
this
one
isn't.
this
was
as
case
with
19
days
of
trial
testimony.
but
even
in
documentary
cases,
this
court
has
said
that
where
all
the
evidence
is
undisputed,
the
inference
to
be
drawn
when
it
is
the
dispositive
fact
is
to
be
drawn
by
the
district
court
and
is
to
be
reviewed
under
rule
52(a).
there
is
not
to
be
de
novo
review.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that,
and
we
have
cited
those
cases
in
our
brief.
so
that
i
won't
go
through...
we
have
done
it
in
our
brief...
the
reasons
why
this
limited
scope
of
review
has
been
provided,
but
there
is
no
question,
this
court
has
definitively
decided
enumerable
times
that
the
standard
of
review
the
fifth
circuit
is
now
applying
is
wrong.
now,
the
other
issue
that
comes
here
is
that
the
fifth
circuit,
after
having
assumed
this
responsibility
of
independent
factfinder,
proceeded
to
apply
the
so
called
james
factors
as
its
methodology
for
resolving
that
fact.
now,
the
james
factors
carry
with
them
two
kinds
of
problems.
the
first
problem
is,
they
list
four
factors
that
are
relevant,
and
number
four
happens
to
be
whether
the
system
has
a...
was
negotiated
or
maintained
with
a
discriminatory
purpose.
well,
since
we
know
that
that
is
the
only
question
under
teamsters,
the
fact
that
there
are
three
up
there
before
it
has
an
intrinsic
potential
for
creating
three
additional
tests
that
a
seniority
system
must
meet,
and
indeed,
that
is
the
way
it
effectively
works
in
the
fifth
circuit.
our
position
is
that
there
ought
not
to
be
any
elevation
of
particular
items
of
evidence
as
the
most
important
items
to
find
discriminatory
purpose.
as
this
court
in
a
quite
different
context
held
in
commissioner
versus
duberstein,
cited
in
our
brief,
when
there
is
a
factfinding
to
be
made,
the
district
court
should
make
it
from
all
the
evidence
in
the
record.
this
court
should
not
declare
certain
facts
shibboleths
which
are
automatically
to
be
touchstones
of
a
ruling
one
way
or
the
other,
and
that
is
in
essence
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
doing.
it
would
be
wrong
to
do
that
even
if
the
three
touchstones
they
cited
were
particularly
probative,
but
in
fact
they
are
not.
the
first
is
impact,
and
as
i
have
already
talked,
and
i
won't
go
through
that
again,
impact
is
a
very
unreliable
indicator
of
the
motive
of
a
seniority
system,
where
the
company
has
historically
discriminated,
because
if
the
parties
chose
any
system
at
all,
it
was
going
to
have
bad
impact,
and
that
doesn't
mean
the
parties
were
badly
motivated.
the
degree
of
impact
is
going
to
be
a
product
of
how
badly
the
employer
discriminated
in
assignments,
not
how
meanly
the
parties
designed
their
seniority
system.
we
have
talked
in
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief,
rather,
about
the
other
two,
and
shown
why
they
likewise
are
not
reliable
indicators.
so
there
ought
not
to
be
a
hierarchy
of
evidentiary
points
at
all,
but
if
there
were
one,
it
should
certainly
not
include
the
three
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
made
dispositive.
and
what
they
did
here,
they
reversed
the
district
court,
ignoring
this
mountain
of
evidence
that
he
had
that
it
seems
to
us
convincingly
showed
this
system
was
innocently
motivated,
because
that
evidence
in
their
scheme
wasn't
to
be
looked
at.
they
had
their
three
little
touchstones,
impact,
the
employer
was
engaging
in
other
discrimination
at
that
time,
and
there
were
some
differences
between
this
system
and
the
system
at
the
company's
northern
plant,
all
of
which
the
district
court
explained,
it
seems
to
us,
quite
convincingly.
so,
we
suggest
that
for
both
of
these
reasons,
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
should
be
reversed,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
may
i
have
one
or
two
moments,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
three
minutes.
thank
you.
just
a
few
very
brief
things.
it
is
not
our
job
here
or
anybody's,
and
certainly
not
the
court's,
to
retry
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
makes
me
somewhat
reluctant
to
have
to
be
up
here
defending
ourselves
on
them,
but
there
has
been
an
effort
to
lay
a
glove
on
the
steelworkers'
union,
and
they
are
quite
sensitive
about
that,
because
back
then
there
was
a
period
when
they
had
whites
and
blacks
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
the
meeting
hall.
that
is
said
to
tarnish
their
colorblind
objectives.
as
i
am
sure
the
court
realizes,
that
was
something
required
by
the
laws
of
bessemer.
indeed,
it
was
a
crime
for
a
union
or
anybody
else,
for
that
matter,
not
to
have
people
sitting
on
opposite
sides,
and
the
court
certainly
can
take
judicial
notice
of
what
was
the
bessemer
city
code
then,
chapter
34,
article
2,
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
neither
one
of
them
thought
that
that
impugned
the
district
court's
finding
that
this
was
a
union
that
pursued
colorblind
objectives,
sought
to
eliminate
wage
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
everything
else.
this
business
about
manipulating
departments
is
something
the
district
court
spent
a
lot
of
time
on.
ninety-five
percent
of
the
people,
black
and
white,
were
in
departments
that
never
changed.
they
were
set
up
long
before
there
was
a
union.
they
were
the
operational
departments.
and
for
every
one
of
the
few
changes
that
were
made,
there
was
a
reason,
and
the
court
gave
it,
and
it
was
a
perfectly
valid
non
racial
reason.
and
what
is
more,
to
think
that
the
parties
wanted
to
separate
the
races
because
they
manipulated
5
percent
of
the
departments
when
95
percent
of
the
people
were
in
racially
mixed
departments
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
not
sure
i
know
what
an
ultimate
fact
is.
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
applies
to
all
facts,
including
the
fact
that
an
action
was
taken
with
or
without
a
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
is
a
question
or
law
what
bona
fide
means.
in
teamsters
this
court
held
what
it
meant.
what
it
meant
was,
you
had
to
have
acted
without
a
discriminatory
purpose.
that
was
a
legal
question.
that
legal
question
having
been
answered,
there
is
now
left
a
question
of
fact:
in
this
case,
did
these
parties
negotiate
this
seniority
system
with
a
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
there
were
a
dispute
about
what
purpose
means,
that
would
be
a
question
of
law,
but
there
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
one
here.
there
is
ultimately
a
factual
question
to
be
asked.
and
that
factual
question
which
in
this
case
was
encapsulated
by
the--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
right.
there
are
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law,
and
it
is
the
court
of
appeals'
job
to
separate
them
out
and
answer
the
legal
questions,
and
then
to
review
the
factual
components
under
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
just
one
last
thing.
the
notion
that
you
are
freed
of
clearly
erroneous
if
the
district
court
made
a
legal
error
is
certainly
not
the
law.
in
our
reply
brief
we
have
cited
cases.
the
district
court
made
a
legal
error.
you
send
it
back
and
tell
them
to
find
the
facts
under
the
right
legal
standards.
you
don't
suddenly
get
freed
as
a
court
of
appeals
to
become
the
factfinder,
and
the
relative
decisions
here
are
the
clearest.
if
ever
you
wanted
a
paradigm
of
why
courts
of
appeals
shouldn't
be
factfinders,
it
is
this
case,
as
our
opening
brief
shows.
