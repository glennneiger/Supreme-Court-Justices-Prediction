unknown
speaker
well,
how
come
it
was
divided
into
two
separate
units
on
racial
lines?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
was
the
plant
divided
into
two
sections?
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
my
question.
were
there
two
separate
units,
one
white
and
one
black,
in
this
plant?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
blacks
and
whites
in
the
same
jobs?
unknown
speaker
my
point
was,
were
they
in
the
same
jobs?
unknown
speaker
and
the
union
permitted
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
union
represent
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
union
allowed
them
to
have
separation
on
the
basis
of
race.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
they
stop
it?
unknown
speaker
did
they
stop
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
it
is
still
based
on
the
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
understand
how
the
union
agreed
to
this
all
along.
unknown
speaker
and
just
accidentally--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
started
off
on
an
unequal
footing.
unknown
speaker
they
ended
up
on
an
unequal
footing.
unknown
speaker
so
if
i
started
off
in
the
plant
solely
because
of
race
the
same
day
you
did,
and
i
started
eight
steps
below
you
on
the
seniority
level,
solely
because
of
my
race--
unknown
speaker
--i'll
bet
you
you
don't
know
what
my
hypothetical
is.
unknown
speaker
i'll
bet
you
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
and
i
start
off
eight
steps
behind
you,
solely
because
of
my
race,
and
i
am
told
i
can't
advance,
and
then
85
years
later
they
tell
me
i
can
advance
to
the
same
extent
that
you
advance,
you
say
i
am
not
discriminated
against?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
difference
is
it
except
the
85
years?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
what
test
did
the
district
court
employ
for
determining
the
intent
in
setting
up
the
system?
unknown
speaker
so
what
do
you
tell
the
negroes,
you
are
sorry?
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
do
you
identify
an
erroneous
standard
of
review?
unknown
speaker
15(a)
of
what?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
so
far
off,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
would
have
to
do
that
even
if
they
were
trying
to
find
out
if
a
mistake
was
really
made.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that--
unknown
speaker
--they
acknowledge
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
for
findings
to
which
it
applies,
but
there
is
one
to
which
it
doesn't
apply.
unknown
speaker
do
they
limit
this
to
title
7
cases?
unknown
speaker
were
those
cases
cited
to
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
were
they
cited
to
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
had
been
a
dozen
or
so
cases--
unknown
speaker
--like
this,
somebody
must
have
cited
something
to
them.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
since.
since.
they
haven't
given
it
up
since,
have
they?
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
friend
has
no
argument
with
you
on
that.
unknown
speaker
he
conceded
that
this
discrimination
had
existed
for
a
long
time.
unknown
speaker
ms.
jones,
are
you
arguing
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
gave
for
not
applying
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
agree,
you
agree
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
finding
of
motive.
unknown
speaker
of
purpose,
racial
discriminatory
purpose.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
applied
some
rule.
i
thought
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
it
didn't
apply
it.
did
it
or
didn't
it
apply
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
some
respects,
yes.
unknown
speaker
when
a
reviewing
court
finds
that
the
initial
tryer
has
applied
erroneous
rules
of
law
to
guide
the
factfinding
process,
is
the
correct
solution
for
the
reviewing
court
to
make
its
own
findings,
or
to
send
it
back
for
making
findings
under
the
corrected
rule
of
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
then
you
do
seem
to
agree
that
for
whatever
reason
it
was,
either
for
legal
error
or
for
some
other
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
to
the
purpose.
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
the
ultimate
finding?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
in
a
good
many
cases
or
at
least
more
cases
than
this
indicated
that
it
did
not
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
rulings
to
ultimate
findings
such
as
purpose?
are
you
familiar
with
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
defend
those
cases,
or
do
you
think
they
are
inconsistent
with--
unknown
speaker
--they
are
certainly
inconsistent
with
other
courts
of
appeals,
i
gather.
how
about
with
cases
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
the
ultimate
finding
of
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
role...
an
independent
role,
independent
of
the...
it
should
make
its
own
assessment
of
the
facts--
unknown
speaker
--in
terms
of
the
ultimate--
unknown
speaker
--the
ultimate
question
of
purpose.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
role
for
the
court
of
appeals,
the
one
the
rules
give
them,
to
determine
whether
the
findings
are
clearly
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
role,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
rule?
i
am
still...
what
rule
do
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
applied
on
the
ultimate
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
those
were
the
three
errors
you
described
earlier.
unknown
speaker
miss
jones,
your
opponent
argues
that
that
was
inevitable,
that
when
you
have
a
history
of
discrimination,
which
was
lawful
no
matter
how
unfortunate
it
may
have
been,
was
it
possible
to
draft
a
seniority
system
that
would
not
have
had
that
impact?
unknown
speaker
but
at
that
time
there
was
no
statute
that
prohibited
it.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
1952.
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me
under
your
argument
no
system
could
be
bona
fide.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
that,
and
they
in
effect
admit
it.
and
they
say,
but
it
was
lawful
at
the
time
we
did
it.
they
don't
admit
all
the
manipulation,
but
they
admit
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
discrimination
here.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
true
if
the
primary
intentional
discrimination
was
by
the
other
union
that
you
have
chosen
not
to...
that
isn't
before
us
now?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there
is
stronger
evidence--
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
on
your
clearly
erroneous
argument,
do
you
say
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
should
have
applied
or
should
have
been
applied
because
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
applies
to
all
questions
of
ultimate
fact,
or
because
purpose
and
motive
is
not
an
ultimate
fact?
unknown
speaker
or
whether
you
had
a
bona
fide
factor
generally.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
it
is
concluded
on
these
facts
there
is
a
purpose,
you
are
saying
what
purpose
means.
unknown
speaker
your
view
is,
there
are
no
so
called
ultimate
facts
to
which
the
rule
does
not
apply.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
