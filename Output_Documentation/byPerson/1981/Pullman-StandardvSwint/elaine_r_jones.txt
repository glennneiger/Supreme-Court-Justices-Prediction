ms.
elaine
r.
jones
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
some
15
years
ago,
less
than
two
years
after
the
passage
and
the
effective
date
of
title
7,
black
employees
at
the
pullman-standard
company
filed
charges
of
discrimination
with
the
eeoc,
seeking
their
rightful
place
in
the
employment
picture
of
the
company.
last
year,
it
became
painfully
clear
that
the
rightful
place
would
never
be
achieved,
as
the
company
permanently
closed
the
doors
of
its
bessemer,
alabama,
plant.
today,
this
court
must
decide
whether
all
relief
is
barred
for
the
affected
class
of
black
employees,
as
it
gropes
with
the
question
of
whether
the
seniority
system
at
pullman-standard
adopted
at
a
time
when
racial
discrimination
was
pervasive,
and
it
pervaded
every
aspect
of
the
life
of
the
company,
and
was
maintained
from
its
genesis
in
1941
until
the
plant
closed
in
1981.
all
during
this
period,
racial
discrimination
at
the
company
was
still
the
order
of
the
day.
and
this
court
must
decide
whether
that
system
is
nonetheless
protected
by
the
narrow
immunity
afforded
to
good
faith
seniority
systems
under
section
703(h).
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
okay.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
thank
you,
chief
justice
burger.
i
just
wanted
to
emphasize
that
pervasive,
intentional
racial
discrimination
was
the
order
of
the
day
at
the
time
this
system
was
adopted.
all
right.
now,
let's
move
to
the
seniority
system.
the
seniority
system
in
this
case
is
the
system
which
was
negotiated
by
the
company,
pullman-standard.
that
system
involves
seniority
rules
and
two
bargaining
units,
the
machinists
and
the
steelworkers.
it
is
not
the
steelworkers
negotiated
system
or
the
machinists
negotiated
system
that
plaintiffs
are...
that
respondents
are
challenging.
we
are
saying
that
the
seniority
system
negotiated
by
pullman-standard,
by
the
company,
the
system
the
employee
faces
when
he
walks
into
the
door,
is
the
system
that
we
challenge.
now,
that
system
has
these
two
component
parts,
and
the
component
parts
of
this
system
are
interrelated
in
their
genesis
and
adoption,
and
in
their
cumulative
impact
on
black
employees
at
pullman-standard.
the
company
simultaneously
negotiated
both
parts.
during
the
genesis
of
the
system
in
1941
and
'42,
the
bargaining
units,
the
machinists
and
the
steelworkers,
negotiated
with
each
other
as
well
as
with
the
company.
three
actors,
the
company,
the
steelworkers,
and
the
machinists,
adopted,
designed,
and
maintained
the
seniority
system.
now,
what
respondents
complain
of
is
their
inability
to
make
interdepartmental
transfers
within
the
steelworkers
unit,
and
the
loss
of
seniority,
and
their
inability
to
transfer
into
the
machinists
unit
without
carryover
seniority.
now,
the
district
court
committed
three
principal
legal
errors
which
flawed
its
analysis
of
bonafideness.
first,
at
the
heart
of
our
claim
that
this
particular
departmental
system
is
not
bona
fide
lies
the
racial
manipulation
and
gerrymandering
of
the
departments.
each
time
departmental
seniority
was
adopted,
the
number
of
one
race
departments
increased,
and
the
racially
stratified
departmental
structure
upon
which
the
seniority
system
was
grafted.
much
of
this
racial
maneuvering
along
department
lines
and
along
bargaining
unit
lines
occurred
during
the
nlrb
certification
process
just
prior
to
the
adoption
of
seniority
at
the
company.
the
district
court
erred
in
determining
as
a
matter
of
law
that
certification
of
the
bargaining
units
by
the
nlrb
was
insulated
from
703(h)
review.
second,
the
district
court
deemed
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law
the
motives
of
one
of
the
principal
architects
of
the
system,
the
machinists.
also,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
district
court
determined
that
evidence
of
adverse
economic
impact
of
the
seniority
system
on
blacks
was
irrelevant
to
a
determination
of
bonafideness.
now,
there
are
other
areas
in
which
the
district
court
made
legal
error
which
i
won't
go
into
at
this
point,
but
one
is,
the
court
also
determined
that
nlrb
certification
of
the
bargaining
units
insulated
the
transparent
facial
irrationality
of
the
system,
because
what
we
have
is
a
machinist,
an
all
white
machinist
bargaining
unit
which
excluded
blacks
by
reason
of
race,
with
its
seniority
system,
and
it
was
able
to
get
the
all
black
bargaining
unit
through
entering
into
an
agreement
with
the
machinists,
and
the
iam
system
has
two
departments,
the
machinists,
the
iam
system,
the
machinist
system,
has
two
departments;
the
steelworkers
system
has
26
departments.
the
two
iam
departments
are
all
white
departments
culled
from
departments
which
were
in...
which
were
previously
racially
mixed
departments
before
unionization.
the
court
of
appeals
was
absolutely
correct
in
its
conclusion
that
the
seniority
system
was
not
bona
fide.
now,
it
is
important
to
review
for
purposes
of
our
argument
the
context
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
reached
its
conclusion.
arlington
heights
tells
us
to
look
at
the
historical
background
in
which
a
decision
was
made.
the
company
negotiated
seniority
rules
at
pullman-standard.
it
was
the
only
actor
who
negotiated
every
seniority
rule
in
this
litigation.
from
the
time
it
opened
its
doors
to
do
business
in
bessemer,
alabama,
in
1929,
it
racially
stratified
the
plant.
there
were
black
jobs,
white
jobs.
it
had
some
all
white
departments,
some
all
black
departments.
it
had
racially
disproportionate
departments.
special
badge
numbers
for
blacks.
all
memos
and
records
indicated
the
race,
"col"
beside
the
names
of
blacks.
it
had
segregated
facilities
at
this
plant
until
1967,
the
same
year
eeoc
charges
were
filed.
now,
we
have
in
1941
the
steelworkers
and
the
machinists
together
coming
to
the
plant.
the
machinists
as
part
of
their
ritual
excluded
blacks
as
a
matter
of
both
policy
and
practice.
with
regard
to
the
petitioner
steelworkers,
the
history
of
its
international
union
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
what
is
at
issue
here
are
the
policies
and
practices
of
local
1466
of
the
steelworkers
unit,
which
was
a
certified
bargaining
agent
at
this
particular
plant
in
bessemer,
alabama.
the
local
practiced
extensive
segregation
of
the
races.
the
local
had
segregated
seating
at
the
union
hall
until
the
first
trial
of
this
case
in
1974.
segregated
facilities
until
the
eeoc
charge
was
filed
in
this
case,
1967.
blacks
were
told
to
stay
in
the
black
jobs
and
sit
on
the
black
side
of
the
union
hall.
now,
true,
blacks
were
not
excluded
from
local
1466,
as
they
were
from
the
machinists
local,
but
blacks
certainly
had
their
place
in
the
steelworkers
local,
and
that
was
stamped
with
a
badge
of
inferiority.
now,
also,
the
practices
of
the
local
steelworkers
was
a
matter
of
choice,
not
a
matter
of
custom
and
practice,
because
in
another
case
before
this
court,
terrell
versus
u.s.
pipe,
which
is
here
on
other
issues,
there
was
a
steelworkers
local
also
in
bessemer,
alabama,
during
the
same
period
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
absolved
the
liability
because
of
their
exemplary
racial
practices.
now,
arlington
heights
indicates
a
sequence
of
events
may
provide
some
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent.
there
are
two
periods
critical
to
development
of
this
seniority
system.
first
is
the
period
1941-42.
the
second
critical
period
is
the
period
1952
through
'54.
we
detail
in
our
brief
the
record
evidence
and
by
the
way,
it
was
not
a
19-day
trial
on
the
issue
of
bona
fides.
there
was
a
three
hour
hearing
in
which
the
evidence
was
documentary.
this
case
was
remanded
in
light
of
teamsters,
and
it
was
a
documentary
case
put
on
before
the
trial
judge.
the
only
witnesses
at
the
hearing
were
two
witnesses
called
by
respondents
where
credibility
was
not
at
issue,
but
the
seniority
documentation
in
this
case
and
the
record
is
all
documents,
and
anything
that
was
referred
to
in
an
earlier
trial
is
still
documentary.
there
is
no
testimony
that
goes
to
the
question
of
bona
fides.
also,
i
invite
the
court
to
look
at
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
district
court
judge
at
appendix
46-47
when
he
granted
a
hearing
in
light
of
teamsters
on
bona
fides,
and
he
made
it
clear
that
the
theory
during
the
trial
was
perpetuation,
and
now
submit
evidence
on
the
question
of
bona
fides.
now,
we
detail
in
our
brief
the
record
evidence
that
leads
to
the
virtually
inescapable
inference
of
intent
regarding
the
iam's
exclusion
of
blacks
from
its
bargaining
unit,
how
at
the
representational
hearing
in
1941-42,
how
it
maneuvered
jobs
based
on
race
and
not
job
function,
how
it
hop
skipped
over
jobs
based
on
the
race
of
the
job
incumbent,
how
the
iam
selected
a
patchwork
quilt
of
production
and
craft
jobs,
and
excluded
any
blacks
that
were
in
production
jobs
but
included
whites
that
were
in
related
production
jobs.
now,
the
machinists
also
represented
both
craft
and
production
jobs
until
the
close
of
the
plant.
now,
at
the
hearing,
the
machinists
attempted
to
exclude
all
blacks
but
was
not
completely
successful
because
the
machinists
bargaining
unit
was
certified
and
included
some
blacks.
when
nlrb
certified
the
union
it
included
some
blacks.
but
the
machinist
was
able
to
rid
itself
of
all
of
the
blacks
in
its
bargaining
unit
when
it
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
steelworkers
where
they
swapped
employees
based
on
the
race
of
the
employee,
and
then
went
back
to
the
nlrb
for
another
certification
one
month
later.
now,
these
racial
maneuverings
during
certification
created
five
new
one
race
departments.
then,
during
the
same
period
of
time,
contemporaneously,
the
company
and
the
usw
sat
down
and
immediately
drafted
a
departmental
seniority
system
onto
these
racially
stratified
departments.
again,
the
intent
of
the
parties,
especially
the
company,
to
keep
blacks
in
these
lower
paying
jobs
and
departments
is
manifested
in
1954,
when
the
steelworkers
readopted
a
departmental
seniority
system.
just
two
months
prior
to
the
adoption
of
that
departmental
system
in
1954,
six
new
one
race
departments
appeared
on
the
seniority
list.
all
of
these
one
race
departments
were
culled
from
previously
racially
mixed
departments.
now,
in
contemplation
of
a
return
to
the
departmental
seniority
system,
the
company
created
without
a
whimper
of
protest
from
the
union,
the
steelworkers,
these
six
departments.
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
record
why.
what
these
departments
do
is
further
segregate
the
plant.
now,
these...
an
example
of
how
this...
the
system
was
maintained
to
continue
this
discriminatory
intent
may
be
determined
by
looking
at
one
particular
department,
the
dye
and
tool
department
at
this
company.
it
was
a
racially
mixed
pre
unionization
department.
that
department,
when
the
iam
and
the
company
and
the
machinists
came
in
there,
was
split
along
racial
lines.
the
iam
took
all
of
the
jobs
in
which
there
were
whites.
the
dye
and
tool
steelworkers
department
had
all
the
jobs
in
which
there
were
blacks.
that
department,
those
departments
were
all
black
and
all
white
until
at
least
1970.
the
company
maintained
the
discriminatory...
the
assignment
of
these
employees
and
maintained
the
seniority
system
by
assigning
employees
in
that
manner.
the
company
could
have
assigned
whites
to
the
steelworkers
unit,
but
it
didn't.
and
so
what
we
have
is
blacks
and
whites
working
together
in
the
dye
and
tool
department,
but
the
blacks
cannot
use
their
seniority
to
get
into
the
better
jobs
right
there
in
dye
and
tool.
maintenance
is
purposeful
perpetuation.
the
company
maintained
the
segregative
purpose
of
the
seniority
system,
not
only
in
dye
and
tool,
but
in
every
racially
disproportionate
department
at
the
company.
now,
the
discriminatory
departmental
assignments
in
this
case,
which
is
the
law
of
the
case
before,
during,
and
after
the
adoption
of
the
departmental
seniority
system,
is
very
strong
evidence
of
an
intent
to
discriminate
entering
the
adoption
and
maintenance
of
the
system.
departmental
assignments
in
this
case
are
not
perpetuation,
because
perpetuation
indicates
inadvertence.
this
is
deliberately
using
the
system
to
keep
blacks
from
accruing
competitive
seniority
so
that
they
might
move
into
historically
white
jobs.
mr.
gottesman
said,
oh,
well,
blacks
can
use
their
seniority
to
move
up
into
other
white
jobs,
other
jobs
in
the
department.
not
so.
the
departments
are
heavily
racially
disproportionate.
they
are
either
disproportionately
white
or
disproportionately
black,
and
you
either
have
a
disproportionately
white
department
with
whites
in
the
better
jobs,
and
a
few
blacks
in
that
department
clustered
at
the
bottom.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
because
of
the
errors
of
law
of
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
was
free
to
look
at
this
case
and
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
did
not
apply.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
indicate
that
there
has
been
legal
error.
he
indicated
that
the
nlrb
certification
should--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--with
respect
to
the
finding
of
motive--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--any
rule
that
the
district
court...
if
it
applied
any
rule,
it
was
only
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
the
court
of
appeals.
if...
because
the--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--i
was
saying,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals,
because
of
the
errors
of
the
district
court,
was
free
of
the
clearly
erroneous
rule,
and
that
was
so--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--well,
i
guess
i
am
making
an
alternative
argument
to
you,
justice
white.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
the
court
of
appeals
does
say
in
its
opinion
that
it
is
of
the
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
had
been
made,
and--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--yes,
it
said
that,
but
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
question
of
intent
did
look
at
the
question,
and
did
not
feel
that
it
was
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
because
of
the
legal
posture
of
this
particular
case.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
well,
in
this
case,
chief
justice
burger,
the
record
is
documentary.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
the
argument
is
over
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts.
the
fifth
circuit...
this
was
the
second
time
the
fifth
circuit
had
reviewed
this
case,
and
it
remanded
it
the
first
time.
this
time,
when
it
saw
the
legal
errors
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
in
the
same
posture
to
make
the
inferences
as
the
court
of
appeals...
as
the
district
court.
the
district
court
had
failed
to
look
at
huge
chunks
of
its
evidence,
because
of
its
erroneous
application
of
legal
principles.
it
had
ruled
out
the
nlrb...
decided
that
the
nlrb,
what
had
happened
was
irrelevant.
it
had
decided
that
the
motives
of
one
of
the
architects
of
the
seniority
system
was
irrelevant.
the
court
of
appeals
had
told
it
before
to
look
at
the
iam
departments.
and
so,
in
this
instance,
the
rationale
behind
rule
52,
which
is
demeanor
of
witnesses
and
credibility
findings
of
trial
courts,
it
didn't
apply,
but--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--no,
i
do
not
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
to
findings
of
purpose.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
evidence,
and
saw
the
erroneous
applications
of
legal
principles,
but
also
the
court
of
appeals
in
looking
at
it
gave...
applied
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
to
whatever
subsidiary
facts
of
the
district
court
judge,
but
the
district
court--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--well,
you
know,
the--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--i
have
looked
at
those
cases,
justice
white,
and
the
district
court...
the
court
of
appeals
fifth
circuit
has
not
treated
these
cases
any
different
from
any
other.
it
has
looked
at
these
cases
as--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--well,
i
mean--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--justice
white,
if
you
take
the
position
of
petitioners,
it
is
that
any
finding...
that
the
finding
of
intent
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
lower
court.
if
you
take
that
position,
in
these
cases,
that
overbroad
reading
would
mean
that
you
have
different
cases,
cases
with
the
same
facts
being
decided
different
ways.
i
mean,
like
cases
must
be
decided
in
a
like
manner.
there
must
be
a
role
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
looking
at
these
cases,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit,
as
in
every
other
circuit,
has
applied
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
to
subsidiary
factfindings
of
the
district
court
judges.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
well,
that...
this
is
a
question
of
law.
it
is
a
question
of
law,
or
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
we
intend
to
think
there
is
a
role
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
looking
at
intent
cases,
and--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--no.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
question,
but
in
terms
of
the
subsidiary--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--it
is
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
findings
of
the
lower
court.
if
there
is
no
role
in
these
cases
for
the
courts
of
appeals,
then
i
think
of
this
court's
decision
in
feeney
and
in
dayton,
in
which
there
was
a
role
for--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--that
is
right.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
that
is
right,
justice
white,
but
in
this
particular
case,
with
the
documentary
evidence
before
it,
the
district
court
had
not
made
findings
of
fact
on
some
of
these
questions.
it
had
just
failed
to
look
at
certain
of
the
evidence.
so
therefore
the
findings
that
the
court
made
had
never
been...
that
the
district
court
had
determined
that
he
was
not
reversing
the...
overruling
the
district
court
or
reversing
it
in
any
way,
but...
and
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
courts
as
to
what
the
factfindings
were,
because
the
district
court
had
not...
had
not
looked
at
the
issue
because
of
its
erroneous
application
of
legal
principles.
the
district
court
has
applied
no
different
rule
from
that
used
by
any
other
circuit
in
discrimination
cases.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
i
say
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
not...
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
and
52(a)
had
no
force
in
this
case
because
of
the
erroneous
errors,
the
legal
errors
of
the
district
court.
the
fifth
circuit
was
free
of
the
clearly
erroneous
rule,
because
of
these
legal
errors.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
and
because
of
those
errors,
the
district
court's
view
of
the
evidence
completely
changed,
would
change
in
terms
of
motive.
the
impact
of
the
iam
on
the
steelworkers
unit,
the
division
of
the
departments,
the
manipulation
between
the
unions,
that
evidence
was
simply...
the
district
court
just
didn't
look
at
that,
and
had
not
looked
at
it,
and
so
therefore
any
of
the
findings
that
it
did
make,
the
court
of
appeals
respected
the
subsidiary
findings
and
applied
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
to
that,
because
it
uses
the
language
in
the
opinion,
and
i
assume
when
it
looked
at
the
facts
of
the
district
court,
the
subsidiary
facts,
those
that
could
stand,
stood.
but
the
question
as
to
whether
intent,
you
know,
is
a
question
of
law
or
an
ultimate
fact
or
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
is...
it
has
to
be
in
these
cases,
intent
has
to
be
a
question
of
law
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
is
bound
by
the
factfinding
of
the
lower
court,
which
this
court...
it
used
no
other
standard
but
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
if
it
used
a
standard.
the
adverse
impact
of
this
seniority
system
is
clear.
the
disproportionate
white
and
disproportionate
black
departments,
the
way
the
system
had
been
maintained
through
the
assignment
of
blacks
and
through
discriminatory
departmental
assignments,
the
legal
errors
of
the
district
court
and
the
fact
that
the
record
was
documentary,
the
fifth
circuit
was
in
a
position
to
look
at
the
evidence
that
the
district
court
had
not
entertained.
there
are
no
disputed
facts
in
this
case.
the
argument
is
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts,
and
in
these
cases,
there
should
not
be
a
hard
and
fast
rule
that
the
court
must
decide
the
case
or
that
it
must
send
the
case
back.
the
official
administration
of
justice
in
these
cases
requires
that
the
court
of
appeals
be
able
to
look
at
these
cases,
and
especially
if
they
are
documentary,
the
52(a)
does
not
have
the
force
that
it
has
if
the
case
were
based
on
credibility
of
witnesses.
the
bona
fides
means
good
faith,
and
section
703
offers
this
particular
departmental
system
no
protection,
almost
by
definition.
acts
taken
over
the
course
of
the
14-year
development
of
the
system
all
move
to
further,
further
segregate
the
system.
there
is
the
creation
of
these
one
race
departments
just
before
the
adoption,
on
the
eve
of
the
adoption
of
the
seniority
system,
and
the
grafting
of
this
seniority
system
onto
a
racially
stratified
company
and
departmental
system
which
both
the
union
and
the
company
had
to
know
would
have
those
foreseeable
consequences.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
the
issue
in
this
case
is...
we
are
not
challenging
the
departmental
systems
per
se.
we
are
challenging
the
racial
manipulations
and
gerrymandering
of
these
departments
prior
to
the
imposition
of
the
departmental
system.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
yes,
but--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--but
70(h)
says,
if
an
intent
to
discriminate
enters
into
the
adoption
or
maintenance
of
the
system,
then
the
system
is
not
bona
fide.
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
oh,
yes.
if
these
departments
had
not
been...
if
they
had
not
intentionally
manipulated
the
departments,
or--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--well,
under
703(h),
if
that
pervasive
intentional
discrimination
entered
into
the
adoption
of
the
seniority
system,
then
that
system
does
not
keep
the
protections
of
703(h).
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
well,
the--
ms.
elaine
r.
jones
--where
the
iam
is
relevant
to
the
machinists,
we
take
the
position,
the
company
negotiated
all
aspects
of
the
system
with
the
steelworkers
and
the
machinists.
the
question
of
the
allocation
of
responsibility
is
a
question
of
remedy,
but
the
question
of
liability
for
purposes
of
703(h)
is
whether
or
not
an
intent
to
discriminate
entered
the
system.
and
if
that
intent
is
there,
well,
then,
that...
for
703(h)
liability
purposes,
that
ends
the
inquiry,
we
contend.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
