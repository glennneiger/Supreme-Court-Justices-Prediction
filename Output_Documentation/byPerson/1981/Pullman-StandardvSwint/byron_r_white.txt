the
first
case
i
have
is
no.
80-1190,
pullman-standard
against
swint.
it's
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
the
case
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
brought
by
employees
against
both
their
union
and
their
employer.
the
claim
was
that
the
seniority
system
to
which
they
were
subject
was
racially
discriminatory.
under
703(h)
of
the
act
to
win
the
case,
it
wasn't
enough
to
show
that
the
seniority
system
had
a
discriminatory
impact.
it
was
necessary
to
show
a
discriminatory
intent.
after
a
long
trial,
the
district
court
held
that
--
that
the
seniority
system
was
not
the
result
of
a
discriminatory
racial
purpose
and
that
the
differences,
the
seniority
system
imposed
were
not
tainted
by
a
racially
discriminatory
intent.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
there
was
such
an
intent
and
that
the
seniority
system
violated
the
act.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
for
the
reasons
we
stated
in
an
opinion
we
have
filed,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
disregarded
the
admonition
of
rule
52(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
requires
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
not
be
set
aside
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
statement
concurring
in
part.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined
in
part.
