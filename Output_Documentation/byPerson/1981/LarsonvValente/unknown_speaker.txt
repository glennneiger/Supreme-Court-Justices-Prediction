unknown
speaker
where
are
the
provisions
set
out
completely?
unknown
speaker
minnesota
law.
unknown
speaker
not
just
the
provision
that
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
salustro,
what
is
the
rationale
for
treating
religious
organizations
differently
from
patriotic
and
fraternal
ones?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
exempts
more
religious
organizations?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
point
raised
by
justice
blackmun
is
one
that
i
would
like
to
pursue
with
you
also,
because
i
don't
understand
the
answer.
what
is
the
reason
for
the
different
treatment
of
these
types
of
organizations?
what
is
the
reason
that
is
advanced
by
the
state
for
that
difference?
unknown
speaker
are
there
not
more
hurdles
to
get
over
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
religious
organization?
that
is,
a
religious
organization
has
all
the
protection
of
the
speech
and
press
clauses,
i
would
assume,
and
in
addition
to
that
it
has
the
protection
of
the
religion
clauses
which
are
not
necessarily
available
to
fraternal
and
patriotic
organizations.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
you
also
have
a
category
in
your
law
of
charitable
organizations
generally.
unknown
speaker
different
from
fraternal
and
patriotic.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
charitable
organizations
are
exempt
if
they
didn't
receive
more
than
$10,000
from
the
public.
unknown
speaker
but
charitable
organizations
generally
can
raise
up
to
$10,000
from
the
public
without
registering.
is
that
it?
and
fraternal
organizations
can't
raise
any
from
the
public
without
registering
it?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
subparagraph
d
says
about
fraternal
and
patriotic
organizations.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
suggest
that
you
treat
religious
societies
the
most
favorably.
they
get
the
most
favorable
treatment
as
compared
to
charitable
organizations
generally?
unknown
speaker
or
charitable.
unknown
speaker
or
charitable
generally.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
on
that
point?
suppose
you
have
two
religious
organizations,
each
of
which
raises
$500,000
every
year,
and
for
one
of
them
that
is
substantially
all
they
raise;
for
another,
they
also
raise
internally
$600,000.
why
should
the
state
interest
be
different
for
those
two
organizations?
it
is
the
same
amount
of
solicitation
of
funds
from
the
public.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
state
interest
the
same
for
the
two?
there
is
precisely
the
same
amount
of
solicitation
from
the
public.
unknown
speaker
don't
they
both
have
the
same
opportunity
to
misrepresent?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
your
answer,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
you've
got
to
draw
the
line
some
place,
and
so
this
is
as
good
as
any
other
line.
that
is
the
only
reason
for
drawing
this
particular
line,
as
i
understand
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
internal
funding,
you
mean
members
or
communicants
or
whatever
it
may
be?
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
my
question.
i
understand
your
argument
about
members.
i
am
talking
about
non-members
who
contribute
$500,000
every
year
to
an
organization
that
gets
$600,000
from
its
own
membership.
they
don't
have
any
different
access
to
information
than
if
they
were
in
the
other
category,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
explanation?
i
haven't
heard
it
quite
yet.
why
shouldn't
the
same
public
that
is
without
that
information,
why
shouldn't
they
have
it
with
respect
to
the
$500,000,
that
is
less
than
half
of
what
the
organization
raises?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
that
is
restating
your
position,
but
you
haven't
said
why,
or
what
the
justification
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
have?
i
know
you
keep
saying
that,
but--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
two
organizations
raise
$500,000
from
ten
people,
from
ten
people.
the
same
ten
people
give
the
same
amount
of
money
to
two
organizations.
and
in
the
one
case
you
will
say
those
ten
people
must
have
information
about
the
organization
and
in
the
other
case
they
aren't
told
a
thing.
they
don't
have
to
be
told
a
thing,
as
long
as
the
money
they
give
is
less
than
half
of
the
organization's
funding.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
i
grant
you...
i
understand
your
assertion,
but
you
haven't
explained
why
you
distinguish
between
those
two
organizations
yet.
but
i
guess
you
have
said
about
as
much
as
you
can.
is
that
it?
well,
aren't
you
also
saying
that
where
you
are
talking
about
any
organization
that
receives
a
certain
percentage
of
its
funding
from
members
or
communicants
that
it
is
more
likely
to
be
controlled
or...
i
can't
think
of
the
exact
word
i
want
to
use,
but
subjected
to
internal
discipline
by
its
own
membership
than,
say,
an
organization
which
gets
1
percent
of
its
funding
from
its
own
members
and
solicits
99
percent
from
the
outside?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
salustro,
presumably
those
same
reasons
apply
to
non-religious
charitable
groups,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
apply
a
different
standard
to
those
entirely.
so
it
is
just
difficult
to
understand
how
the
state
can
justify
the
50
percent
line
within
the
religious
charitable
organization
category
but
not
the
others,
because
your
arguments
would
apply
equally
well
to
the
other
types
of
charitable
organizations,
would
they
not?
unknown
speaker
you
might
be
in
trouble,
might
you
not,
under
cases
like
sherbert
against
verner
and
indiana...
thomas
versus
indiana
employment
security
commission,
if
you
were
to
get
too
close
to
a
religious
organization?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
state
to
have
precisely
the
same
requirements
with
respect
to
all
charitable
and
religious
organizations
insofar
as
registering
and
disclosure
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
you
could
just
have
across
the
board...
is
there
some
case
like
that?
you
are
saying
that
you
may
regulate
religious
solicitations
in
the
identical
way
you
may
regulate
non-religious
charitable
solicitation.
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
be
valid
if
you
just
eliminated
subsection...
the
religious...
the
particular
religious
provision
here?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
case
you
rely
on
that
you
can
treat...
that
you
can
regulate
religious
solicitations?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
religious
organization
as
a
part
of
their
doctrine...
suppose
part
of
their
doctrine
is
the
duty
to
raise
money?
unknown
speaker
what
bearing
do
you
think
the
krishna
consciousness
case
that
the
court
decided
last
spring
has
on
this?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
did
the
state
treat
the
plaintiffs
as
a
religious
organization
originally
by
initiating
some
kind
of
action?
was
it
not--
unknown
speaker
--but
did
the
state
take
the
position
that
it
was
a
charitable
religious
organization
governed
by
the
50
percent?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fisher?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
contend
that
a
state
couldn't
require
some
disclosure
from
all
religious
organizations
which
seek
to
solicit
funds,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
exemption
b,
which
is
the
one
that
is
at
issue
here,
309.515(b),
suppose
that
were
just
not
in
the
law,
and
that
all
religious
organizations
were
covered
under
the
charitable
provision.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
arguably
then
religious
organizations
could
not
be
treated
the
same
as
charitable
ones?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
agree,
though...
as
i
understand
it,
churches
can
either...
they
can
raise...
any
church
can
raise
up
to
$10,000
without
registering.
unknown
speaker
but
then
they
can
also
raise
up
to
one-half,
up
to
49.9
percent
of
their
funding.
unknown
speaker
which
other
charitable
organizations
can't
do.
unknown
speaker
so
they
are
given
a
better
break.
unknown
speaker
well,
some
churches
are,
but
they
all
get
the
charitable...
all
other
churches
are
at
least
given
$10,000
exemption.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
unusual
about
lawyers
going
on
in
litigation
and
losing
a
case
the
first
two
rounds
and
then
deciding
that
they
had
better
change
their
approach
to
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
admirable
or
not,
it
might
be
sensible,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fisher,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
gillette
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
why?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
instead
of
49.9
it
was
90
percent.
unknown
speaker
if
it
exempts
any
church
from
registration
if
it
raises
90
percent
of
its
funds
from
its
members.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
reason
is
that
the
state
thinks
it
is
a
good
enough
guarantee
against
fraud
because
there
is...
if
it
raises
that
much
money
from
its
members
who
really
know
what
is
going
on,
that
is
a
decent
enough
safeguard.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
judgment,
that
is
an
argument.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
legislature
had
made
findings
to
that
effect?
i
know
you
probably
wouldn't
agree
with
them,
but
at
least
it
would
have
been
a
legislative
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
agree
that
the
legislature
would
be
entitled
to
think
that
most
churches,
most
churches
raise
their
funds
from
within
their
own
membership?
would
that
be
a
reasonable
starting
point?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
know
whether
that
is
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
no,
do
you
know
whether...
do
you
suggest
you
don't
know
whether
that
is
the
fact?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
legislature
started
with
that
premise,
then,
without
respect
to
subjective
relief.
suppose
the
legislature
said
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
i
have
changed
it
from
fact
to
premise.
if
that
was
the
premise
of
the
legislature,
that
most
churches
raise
their
money
from
their
members,
and
as
justice
white
suggested,
then
the
members
are
going
to
conduct
their
own
surveillance
of
the
use
of
that
money,
but
that
they
are
looking
at
people
who
claim
religion
clause
exemptions
where
perhaps
they
have
1
or
2
percent
raised
from
the
membership
and
the
balance
raised
from
doing
what
was
done
in
the
hari
krishna
case
last
year
in
this
court,
soliciting
on
the
street
and
in
public
places.
do
you
think
the
legislature
would
not
be
entitled
to
address
that
problem?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case--
unknown
speaker
--where
the
state
comes
in
and
files
a
complaint
and
says,
we
don't
think
this
is
a
church
at
all,
it
is
a
bucket
shop
operation,
and
you
are
just
making
a
lot
of
phone
calls
from
a
basement
trying
to
raise
money,
and
you
say,
no,
we
are
a
religion,
and
we
want
summary
judgment
on
that
basis.
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
what
factors
will
be
open
on
review
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
is,
then
the
statute
is
invalid
under
the
eighth
circuit's--
unknown
speaker
--well,
won't
it
just
mean
that
that
particular
exemption
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
so
you
will
still
be
subject
to
registration
and
disclosure.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
that
particular...
just
(d).
just
exemption
(d).
that
is
the
one
that
distinguishes
between
one
church
and
another.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
i
thought
the
state
says
that...
and
i
thought
you
conceded
that
a
church,
like
anybody
else,
can
raise
up
to
$10,000.
exemption
(a)
exempts
any
charity
up
to
$10,000.
unknown
speaker
but
any
charity
that
raises
more
than
that
from
the
public
has
to
register.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
that
apply
to
a
church?
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
at
issue
was
exemption
(d).
unknown
speaker
(d).
unknown
speaker
yes,
(b).
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry,
(b).
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
one
that
is
at
issue,
isn't
it?
but
the
relief
granted
was
to
extend
the
exemption
rather
than
to--
unknown
speaker
--why
isn't
the
validity
of
that
relief
at
issue
here
too?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judgment
below
is
challenged.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
needlessly
destructive
of
this
statute--
unknown
speaker
--to
say
that
no
part
of
the
statute
may
apply
to
any
church?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
it
would
be
treating
churches
evenhandedly
with
all
other
charitable
organizations.
unknown
speaker
in
the
case
of
a
federal
court
reviewing
a
state
statute,
do
you
think
it
is
entirely
at
liberty
if
it
concludes
one
portion
of
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
to
either
strike
down
that
provision
or
to
extend
the
provision
in
a
way
that
it
believes
would
make
the
whole
statute
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
until
they
attack
it.
unknown
speaker
until
they
attack
it.
unknown
speaker
no
correlation
with
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
had
conceded
in
response
to
justice
white's
questions
ten
minutes
ago,
more
or
less,
that
there
is
a
certain
assurance
to
the
public
that
if
a
large
part,
without
putting
a
fixed
figure
on
it,
if
a
large
part
of
the
support
comes
from
the
membership,
that
then
there
is
reasonable
assurance
that
the
surveillance
of
the
church's,
the
organization's
activities
is
ongoing.
do
you
suggest
that
is
not
a
reasonable
subject
of
inquiry
now?
unknown
speaker
it
can
be
advanced
in
support
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
legislation,
may
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fisher--
unknown
speaker
--this
statute
wasn't
aimed
at
churches,
period,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
aimed
at
charitable...
raising
funds
for
charity.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just...
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
that.
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree,
though,
would
you
not,
that
a
state
can
properly
pass
a
reasonable
disclosure
law
applicable
to
all
churches
who
solicit
funds
from
the
public?
would
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
if
the
statute
were
confined
strictly
to
a
church-sponsored
retirement
community?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
is
there
any
line
that
could
be
drawn
by
the
legislature
that
would
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
in
place
of
the
50
percent.
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
back
to
the
question.
is
there
a
line
that
would
be
constitutional,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
ten
percent,
25
percent,
33
and
a
third
percent?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
argument
made
when
that
minnesota
case
was
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
get
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
suppose
there
weren't
any
50
percent
limitation
here
at
all,
just
a
complete
requirement
of
reporting
by
every
church.
would
you
object?
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect?
all
they
have
to
do
is
file
reports,
period.
unknown
speaker
forget
about
all
the
other
fringe
material
which
is
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
like
you
to
address
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
i
think
you
still
haven't
answered.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is,
as
i
recall
it,
whether
you
would
find
unconstitutional
a
neutral
reporting
statute
without
any
percentage
limitation
in
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
below
indicated
that
it
would
uphold
exempting
any
organization,
including
a
church,
if
it
raised
all
of
its
money
from
its
members.
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
distinguish
between
churches,
those
that
raise
all
their
money
from
members
and
churches
that
don't
raise
all
their
money
from
members.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
disagree
with
the
court
below
in
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
the
court
below,
though,
it
seems
to
me,
would
have
sustained
the
law
if
it
distinguished
between
churches
on
that
basis,
and
yet
they
disagreed
if
the
legislature
made
it
50
percent.
