mr.
barry
a.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
after
17
years
with
a
charitable
solicitation
statute
like
other
states,
categorically,
neutrally,
evenhandedly
exempting
all
churches,
minnesota
amended
its
statute,
taking
that
exemption
away
from
some
but
not
other
churches,
subjecting
them
to
the
statute's
comprehensive
regulatory
and
licensing
requirements,
including
extensive
recordkeeping,
cpa
certification,
substantial
record
filings,
expenditure
limitations,
access,
disclosure,
and
publication
of
church
documents,
and
an
open-ended
nationwide
investigation,
all
provisions,
i
think,
which
comrephensively
facilitate
a
sustained,
detailed
enforcement
audit
as
to
what
are
bona
fide
religious
expenditures,
solicitations
and
religions.
and
the
statute,
your
honors,
arms
the
licenser
with
broad
investigative
powers
and
provides
for
license
suspension,
revocation,
receivership,
criminal
prosecution
for
enforcing
this
law
and
this
regulatory
scheme
which
surely
imposes
burdens,
substantial
burdens
on
churches,
burdens
which
simply
aren't
remote
or
de
minimis.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
that
is
certainly
not
this
case.
i
think
that
it
may,
if
it
were
evenhandedly
applied
to
all
churches,
may,
depending
on
how
it
is
done,
pose
some
entanglement
problems
possibly.
but
it
is
certainly
not
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
again,
then
there
would
be
evenhandedness.
there
would
not
be
a
problem
of
neutrality
and
evenhandedness,
and
there
would
be,
i
think,
the
problems
of
entanglement
that
are
addressed
in--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--i
think
also
there
would
be
the
problem
that
has
been
addressed
by
some
of
the
questions
this
morning
respecting
unequal
treatment
of
churches
vis-a-vis
other
charitable
organizations.
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
some
churches
are,
and
i
think--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
this
legislation
which
dose
impose
burdens
on
those
churches
that
it
does
apply
to
deserves
the
court's
scrutiny,
both
as
to
the
substantiality
of
the
reason
for
drawing
any
line
at
all
treating
churches
unequally,
saying
that
some
have
to
bear
the
onus
of
regulation
and
others
don't
and
the
substantiality
of
the
reason
for
drawing
the
line
where
it
is,
and
this
close
scrutiny,
i
suggest,
is
called
for
by
the
establishment
clause's
core,
most
essential
principle
of
scrupulous
intersectarian
evenhandedness
between
churches.
and
what
is
the
reason
here
for
this
disparate
treatment,
this
gerrymandering
of
churches?
your
honors,
absolutely
no
facts,
no
logic
or
reason
i
think
explain
this
disparate
treatment.
there
is
no
mention
whatsoever
of
any
reason
for
this
in
the
legislative
history,
and
strikingly,
absolutely,
there
is
not
a
single
mention
whatsoever
of
any
purpose
or
reason
for
this
law
mentioned
by
appellants
to
the
court
of
appeals.
nothing.
there
is
nothing
in
their
briefs,
nothing
in
their
argument.
it
wasn't
until
the
eleventh
hour
of
this
litigation
before
this
court
that
in
their
briefs
they
start
positing
possible
explanations
for
this
law,
and
it
really
changes.
if
you
look
at
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
their
opening
brief
and
the
reply
brief,
and
particularly
footnote
6
of
their
reply
brief,
you
see
changes.
they
are
grappling.
there
really
isn't
a
purpose.
there
wasn't
one.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
some
would
call
that
admirable.
i
don't
know.
but
i
mean
it
underscores
the
problem
here
of--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--it
might
be,
but
i
think
it
doesn't
work
here.
i
think
that
the
shifting
around
and
the
search
for
a
reason
for
this
unequal
treatment
just
doesn't
work.
the
premise
of
the
reason
which
they
give
now,
which
is
member
control,
isn't
supported
by
any
logic,
reason,
or
facts
here.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
same
as
gillette,
nor...
even
if
it
were--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--even
if
it
were,
gillette's
depth
of
analysis,
i
think,
would
decide
this
statute's
unconstitutionality.
the
analysis
in
that
case
was
substantial,
and
not
the
appellant's
proposed
test
here
of
some
one-dimensional
application
of
a
mechanical
test,
just
looking
to
see
if
you
can
find
any
secular
purpose
whatsoever
and
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
that
isn't
what
the
court
did,
and
if
it
was,
or
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
such
a
test,
it
would
eliminate
two-thirds
of
the
tripartite
test
in
lemon,
a
test
which
was...
brought
together
all
the
extant
strands
of
establishment
clause
cases
at
that
time
and
discussed
them,
didn't
even
mention
gillette,
nor
has
gillette
ever
been
mentioned
by
any
establishment
clause
case
of
this
court
in
the
ten
years
since
decided.
it
is
just...
there
is
a
complete
analysis
there
as
to
the
justification
for
the
underinclusiveness
in
gillette,
including
that
the
congress
went
as
far
as
it
could,
accommodating
free
exercise,
that
the...
to
go
any
further
would
pose
entanglement
problems,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
administer,
and
that
the
court
was
deferring
to
the
government's
overriding
article
1,
section
8
interests
that
were
the
basis
of
that
legislation.
this
legislation
here
is
legislation
regulating
churches
on
its
face,
directly.
in
gillette,
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
that
was
a
law
not
on
its
face
with
disparate
de
facto
impacts.
this
is
legislation
saying
that
some
churches
should
be
regulated,
some
shouldn't.
the
legislature
absolutely
understood
that
there
were
churches
on
both
sides
of
the
line
or
they
wouldn't
have
amended
the
law
after
17
years.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
there
would
still
be--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--i
would
be
making
the
argument
that
the
differential
treatment
must
be
closely
examined
to
see
what
the
reason
is,
whether
it
is
90
percent,
20
percent,
or
50
percent.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
the
problem
there,
your
honor--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
it's
an
argument,
here
not
supported,
i
think,
by
any
logic,
reason,
or
facts.
i
mean,
plainly,
members
of
churches
on
one
side
of
the
line,
those
supported
by
50
percent
member
contributions,
have
no
more
power
and
are
no
more
likely
to
protect
the
public
by
scrutinizing
public
solicitations
and
expenditures
of
moneys
collected
from
the
public
than
are
those
churches
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
it
would
depend
on
what
they
were,
but
here
there
is
nothing.
it
just
doesn't
follow.
many
churches,
as
the
court
well
knows,
are
hierarchically
structured,
non-democratic
kinds
of
organizations,
and
just
mere
membership
accords
nothing,
and
of
course
membership
isn't
even
defined
in
the
statute.
we
don't
know
if
this
is
occasional
congregants,
true
believers,
card-carriers,
or
what.
i
mean,
there
is
no
reference
in
here.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
don't
know.
frankly,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
it
isn't
my
belief.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
again,
it
would
be
a
matter
of
careful
scrutiny.
if
there
was
just
a
categorical
statement,
as
there
is
an
argument
today,
that
this
is
a
fact,
i
think
that
the
court
should
examine
that,
and--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
it
is
certainly
entitled
to
address
the
problem,
but
again,
when
it
draws
lines,
putting
churches
into
different
categories,
we
have
to
look
to
the
premise
and
the
facts
that
support
this
differential
treatment,
and
if
there
was
proof
that
there
was
self-regulation,
that
satisfies
part
of
the
problem,
but
there
is
another
problem
with
this.
there
is
no
explanation
whatsoever
for
this
odd
gerrymander
line
that
is
tied
to
an
abstract
proportion,
that
isn't
related
to
the
degree
of
the
effect
on
the
minnesota
public
at
all.
you
could
raise
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
from
the
minnesota
public,
and
there
could
be
an
enormous
impact
on
the
public,
but
that
church
could
be
exempt,
but
one
collecting
merely
$10,000
unmatched
by
member
contributions
would
be
regulated,
and
there
is
just
no
correlation--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
if
we
are
talking
about
with
respect
to
this
statute,
which
i
assume
we
are,
there
is
such
an
allegation,
it
would
depend
on
the
normal
rules
of
summary
judgment
and
their
application
to
what
is
before
that
court.
however,
assuming
that
there
was
a
dispute
on
that
fact,
then
on
the
establishment
clause
issue,
i
should
underscore
that
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
precisely
what
the
case
is
here.
the
eighth
circuit
vacated
summary
judgment
below,
and
they
remanded
the
case
for
a
factual
determination
of
that
merits
issue
as
to
whether
the
appellee
is
entitled
to
an
injunction.
the
case
stands
before
this
court
without
final
order.
it
is
an
interlocutory
matter
at
this
time.
that
determination
will
be
made,
and
we
don't
disagree
with
the
making
of
that
determination,
and
it
might
have
been
a
more
expeditious
thing
if
that
is
what
appellants
wanted
had
they
gone
back
to
the
district
court
then.
there
is
no
question
that
the
appellees
have
had
standing
at
every...
every
proceeding
of
this
case.
so
far
it
has
been
properly
alleged.
there
was
even
a
preliminary
determination
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
that
very
issue
when
the
court
granted
the
preliminary
injunction
below.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
the
factors
open
will
be
with
respect
to
the
standing,
and
that
is
just
one
of
some
seven
different
constitutional
attacks
to
the
statute
that
were
raised
below,
the
district
court
finding
it
only
necessary
to
reach
establishment
clause,
but
the
fact
determination
will
be
a...
for
the
district
court
to
make
a
final
determination
of
that
which
he
may
preliminarily,
that
is,
whether
appellee
is
a
church
organization.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well...
if
once
that
determination
is
made
a
final
order
may
issue
in
the
case
dealing
both
with
the
law,
which
has
been
the
matter
of
a
determination
by
the
district
court
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
this
question
of
whether
an
injunction
should
issue
with
respect
to
this
particular
organization.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
with
this
additional
fact
determination,
which
the
matter
was
remanded
for
the
court
depending
on
its
ruling,
assuming
that
it
finds
this
appellee
a
church
organization--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--will...
could
enter
an
injunction
saying
in
addition
this
law
cannot
be
applied.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
right,
but
assuming
that
that
is
held
unconstitutional--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--then
there
will
not
be
provisions
with
respect
to
churches.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
the
holding
of
the--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
the
holding
of
the
district--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
the
holding
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
find
this
statute
constitutionally
inapplicable
to
churches,
to
any
church,
because
of
the
disparate
treatment.
it
didn't
extend
the
statute
taking
away
the
exemption
so
that
it
applied.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
but
that
exemption...
exemption
(b).
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
the
exemption
that
was--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
(b).
the
exemption--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
rather
than
make
the
determination
that
the
legislature
would
have
if
faced
with
the
option
have
taken
away
the
exemption
as
to
any
church,
they...
it
held
that
the
statute
could
not
be
applied
constitutionally
to
any
church.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
it
isn't.
it
certainly
hasn't
been
raised
in
any
pleading,
and
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
it
is
challenged,
but
no
one
for
appellants
has
mentioned
that
in
brief
or
in--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--no,
i
think
to
the
contrary.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
to
take
the
exemption,
i
mean,
to
go
the
other
way
and
to
take
the
exemption
away
from
all
churches,
making
them
all
subject
to
this
law,
i
think,
would
even
heighten,
greatly
heighten
the
entanglement
problems,
and
i
think
it--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
i
think
that
with
all
due
respect
it
may
be
better
for
a
legislature
to
make
the
determination
that
all
churches
are
going
to
be
regulated
than
for
a
court
to
do
that,
and
i
think
the
legislative
history,
scant
as
it
is,
and
it
is
before
the
court,
makes
clear
that
the
legislature
did
not
want
to,
in
the
words
of
one
legislator,
did
not
want
to
"mess
around"
with
some
churches,
and
they
were
careful
to
make
sure
that
this
was
written
in
a
way
that
would
exclude
the
catholic
archdiocese,
but
on
the
other
hand
make
sure
that
the
exemption
was
taken
away
from
others.
there
are
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
that.
i
don't
think
they
intended
to
bring
in
the
catholics
and
the
lutherans
and
the
protestants
and
the
other
groups,
but
perhaps
the
court
could
enter
such
an
order,
but
it
would
not
be
popular.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
think
that
the
court
perhaps
would
have
that
option.
i
think,
though,
in
selecting
an
option
of
relief,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct
in
treating
it
the
way
they
did,
which
put
it
to
a
status
quo,
leaving
the
entire
charitable
solicitation
act
intact
as
it
was
extant
until
1978,
when
this
amendment
came
in.
it
also,
i
think,
was
perhaps
judicious
of
the
district
court
to
rule
just
on
this
one
issue,
because
this
law
was
also
challenged
on
free
speech,
standardless
licensing,
vagueness,
and
many
other
issues
challenging
the
law
across
the
board
in
its
application
to
any
charity
or
religion
or
non-profit
organization,
and
the
court
ruled
just
very
narrowly
on
the
establishment
clause
issue,
leaving
the
rest
of
the
statute
intact
and
enforceable
as
to
others.
so,
i
mean,
there
are
options.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
excuse
me?
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
i
just
don't
think
that
there
is
any
necessary
correlation,
as
i
was
saying
before,
between
the
amount
of
money
that
a
given
organization
collects
from
the
public
and
the
percentage
of
that
organization's
total
that
comes
from
the
public.
a
million
dollars
can
be
10
percent,
80
percent,
5
percent.
there
is
just
no
correlation.
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--there
is
no
correlation
between
the
abstract
proportion,
this
member-public
contributions,
and
correlation
with
the
amount
of
money
that
is
collected
from
the
public.
in
other
words,
looking
at
the
ratio,
if
you
saw
that
it
was
40,
60
percent
or
whatever,
wouldn't
tell
you
anything
about
what
the
impact
on
the
public
is.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
no,
i
did
not...
that
may
be
a
reasonable
subject
of
inquiry,
to
see
if
that
is
really
true,
or
you
know,
if
it
logically
follows,
or
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
is
certainly
not
here.
it
is
not
presented
here.
it
is
something
that
was
thought
of...
there
just
isn't
anything
in
this
case
that--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
and
i
think
that
if
it
stands
on
logic
or
reason,
on
its
own,
without
requiring
any
facts,
then
maybe
the
court,
you
know,
is
free
to
embrace
that,
but
here
it
is
completely
speculative.
i
suggest
that
it
isn't
true,
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
49
percent
membership
group
as
opposed
to
a
51
will
have
any
more
power
or
access,
any
more
inclination,
any
more
desire,
or
will
be
just
more
likely
to
have
access
to
anything...
we
are
talking
about
mere
members...
than
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
i
think
it
is
interesting,
too,
that
there
was
an
amendment,
you
could
see,
following
the
legislative
history,
to,
one,
the
treatment
of
groups
other
than
religious,
and
one
regarding
religious.
the
one
regarding
other
than
religions
said
that
to
be
exempt
you
have
to
have
100
percent
come
from
members,
but
not
just
any
members.
they
must
be
real
control
members.
they
must
be
voting
members.
and
there
was
a
provision
for
voting
members
in
an
early
draft
of
the
religion
one,
and
you
know,
that
was
taken
out,
and
it
was
taken
out
during
a
colloquy
that
said,
you
know,
if
we
leave
that
in
as
to
voting
members,
that
is
going
to
mean
that
the
catholic
archdiocese
and
other
hierarchical,
non-democratically
organized
groups
are
going
to
lose
theirs,
and
we
don't
want
to
mess
around
with
them,
so
we
had
better
take
that
voting
requirement
out.
so
we
know
that
it
is
just
rank
members,
and
we
don't
even
know,
again,
what
that
means
in
the
context
of
this
statute.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a...
this
legislative
history
gives
particular
reason
for
the
court's
close
scrutiny,
because
i
think
there
is
an
inherent
potential
risk
that
by
fashioning
legislation
that
focuses
on
churches,
taking
into
account
differences
in
membership,
organizational
structure,
funding
sources,
and
what
have
you,
all
matters,
by
the
way,
i
think,
which
are
constitutionally
sensitive
inquiries,
because
they
are
often
dependent
on
church
doctrine
or
how
churches
perceive
their
mission,
and
what
have
you--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
sir.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
this
amendment--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--that's
right.
when
it
was
enacted--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--no.
i
mean,
when
it
was
initially
enacted
17
years
before
the
amendment,
it
focused
on
charities,
just
like
other
states
have
charitable
solicitation
statutes.
it
is
this
amendment,
which
is
unprecedented
in
the
country,
save
for
the
north
carolina
amendment,
which
was
found
unconstitutional
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
heritage
village
case
recently.
it
is
unprecedented,
and
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
case
before
this
court
where
a
legislature
actually
sits
down
and
decides
that
some
churches
are
going
to
be
regulated
and
others
aren't,
and
setting
out
some
very
substantial
regulatory
burdens
that
some,
but
not
others,
are
going
to
have...
be
saddled
with.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
i
agree
that
this
is
possible.
i
suspect
that
it
could
very
well
raise
potential
free
exercise
problems,
some
entanglement
problems
or
what
have
you,
depending
on
what
that
disclosure
is
and
to
whom
and
what
have
you.
certain
things
obviously
are
more
sensitive
than
others.
internal
church
documents
regarding
doctrine,
membership
lists,
and
this
sort
of
thing,
depending
on
what
follow-up
is
attached
to
the
disclosure...
there
could
be
substantial
problems.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
when
you
are
talking
about
the
jugular
of
the
lifeblood
flow
of
funds
for
the
church's
support,
you
are
talking
about
one
thing,
as
this
statute
talks
about.
when
you
are
talking
about
the
charitable
kinds
of
activities
that
churches
often
are
involved
in,
i
think
that
that
perhaps
is
another
question,
and
the...
this
law,
though,
goes
to
the
question
of
regulating
the
church
support
fund
question
itself.
does
that
answer
the
question?
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
again,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
dramatically
illustrates
the
potential
risk
when
there
is
line
drawing
that
the
legislature
may
be
subject
to
kind
of...
more
likely
to
be
influenced
by
the
result
or
the
effect
of
where
they
draw
the
line,
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
seven
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
let's
make
sure
about
the
catholic
archdiocese.
on
the
other
hand,
let's
make
sure
that
we
get
the
people
at
the
airports,
and...
and
there
is
one
comment
that
i
think
is
right
on,
the
heart
of
the
matter,
by
a
senator
celoff,
who
says,
let's
make
sure...
i
mean,
that
this
applies
to
those
institutions
that
are
not
substantial
institutions
in
our
state,
and
there
is
also
a
reference
to
something
like,
why
are
we
so
hot
to
get
the
moonies?
i
mean,
there...
and
there
isn't
anything
else.
i
mean,
there
is
nothing
that
tells
you
the
reason
for
the
legislation
or
anything,
but
when
it
gets
down
to
where
to
draw
the
line,
there
is
some
concern,
and
i
think
that
that
just
is
more
reason
why
the
court
should
give
this
close
scrutiny.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
think
that
if--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
the
problem
with
the
50
percent
is
that
there
is
just
nothing
that
supports
it
in
fact
or
logic.
if
there
were,
if
there
were
findings
and
studies
where
it
really
was
shown
that
there
was
control
by
the
public,
then
it
would
be
a
harder
case
if
and
only
if
there
was
some
sort
of
real
tying
of
the
line
to
the
impact
on
the
public.
in
other
words,
here
you
have
an
abstract
proportion
that
doesn't...
really
isn't
correlated,
doesn't
really
relate
to
how
much
money
is
really
being
taken
from
the
public,
because
your
interest
is
the
public.
if
it
did
have
some
sort
of
a
figure,
and
there
were
findings
that
some
kinds
of
groups
would
take
care...
that
would
be
able
to
self-police,
to
self-manage
their
solicitation
practices
and
their
uses
of--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
there
might
be.
there
might
be.
i
am
not--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
again,
i
am
saying
it
is
possible,
but
it
would
depend
on
a
real
showing
of,
you
know,
a
meaningful
line
drawing
that...
where
there
is
a
legitimate
reason
for
distinguishing.
i
think
in
many
of
the
court's
cases
where
such
line
drawing
may
have
been
allowed...
i
mean,
gillette
allowed
some
under
inclusiveness.
i
mean,
there
was
analysis.
there
were
reasons
for
upholding
this,
and
i
just
don't
think
that
there
are
here,
and
that
is
really
the
crux
of
the
matter.
i
mean,
there
is
just
nothing
that
really
supports
a
lack
of
evenhandedness.
in
the
krishna
case,
in
hefron,
i
mean,
that
was
evenhandedness.
that
was
treating...
the
problem
there
was
that
the
krishnas
perhaps
were
seeking
some
special
treatment.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
no.
but
that
would
have
been
perhaps
the
effect,
and
it
was
conceded,
i
think,
in
that
case
by
counsel,
that
they
really
didn't...
in
that
particular
case
they
shouldn't
have
a
claim
of
special
treatment,
but
that
would
have
been
the
effect,
i
think,
of
a
ruling,
and
the
court
said
this
was
a
rule
being
evenhandedly
applied
to
everyone,
the
booth
requirement.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
first
of
all,
there
is
more
than
just
reporting
here,
but
assuming
that
there
was
evenhanded
treatment,
neutral
treatment,
then
i
think
that
there
would
not
be
a
neutrality
problem,
as
we
have
argued,
but
there
would
be
an
entanglement
problem.
there
would
be,
i
think--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
that
is
not
this--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--right.
okay.
well,
that
fringe
material
makes
it
plenty
more
than
just
disclosure.
if
it
did,
i
think
it
would
be
obviously
a
much
more
difficult
case.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
without
seeing
it,
but
giving
an
answer,
a
yes
or
no,
i
would
say
i
would
not
find
that
constitutional.
i
would
still
have
a
problem
with
that,
even
that
type
of
law.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
that
also
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
have
problems
with
that,
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
think
the
court
was
grappling
for
what
is
an
answer
in
this
area,
and
it
is
a
difficult
question.
thank
you.
