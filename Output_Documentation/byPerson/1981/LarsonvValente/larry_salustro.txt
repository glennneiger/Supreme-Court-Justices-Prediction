mr.
larry
salustro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
narrow
issue
of
the
constitutionality
under
the
establishment
clause
of
an
exemption
provision
in
minnesota's
charitable
solicitation
act.
the
provision
in
question
exempts
from
the
financial
disclosure
requirements
otherwise
applicable
to
charitable
organizations
in
the
act
those
religious
organizations
and
societies
which
solicit
more
than
half
of
their
contributions
from
their
members
and
from
their
affiliates.
the
appeal
presents
the
question
whether
the
establishment
clause
prohibits
a
state
from
tailoring
a
regulatory
program
to
allow
coverage
of
some
religious
organizations
where
the
application
of
the
law
to
religious
organizations
is
based
on
criteria
unrelated
to
matters
of
religious
belief
or
dogma.
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
the
holy
spirit
association
for
the
unification
of
world
christianity,
incorporated,
and
four
of
its
members.
defendants
are
the
two
state
officials
in
the
state
of
minnesota
responsible
for
enforcing
the
provisions
of
minnesota's
charitable
solicitation
act.
i
will
discuss
the
provisions
declared
unconstitutional,
the
procedural
history
of
the
establishment
clause
issue
in
the
court
below,
and
why
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
larry
salustro
the
provisions
of
the--
mr.
larry
salustro
--minnesota
law
are
set
out
completely
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
larry
salustro
provision
of
the
entire
charitable
solicitation
law
set
out
as
an
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
larry
salustro
through
financial
disclosure,
the
state
of
minnesota
seeks
to
inform
charitable
contributors
of
the
organizations
that
are
soliciting
contributions
from
them.
the
state
seeks
to
protect
contributors
from
fraud
and
from
misrepresentation
by
those
organizations
as
to
the
identity
of
the
organization,
the
purpose
of
the
organization,
and
the
use
to
which
funds
are
put
by
that
organization.
through
a
series
of
six
exemptions,
minnesota
has
determined
that
disclosure
is
not
always
necessary
to
effectuate
the
state's
objectives.
one
of
these
six
exemptions
is
the
exemption
for
religious
organizations
and
societies
that
solicit
more
than
half
of
their
contributions
from
their
members
and
affiliates,
and
the
narrow
issue
here
is
the
application
of
the
establishment
clause
to
that
provision.
the
procedural
history
here--
mr.
larry
salustro
--the
criteria
used
in
religious
organizations
and
in
fraternal
and
patriotic
organizations,
the
criteria
for
exemption
is
the
same,
namely,
the
extent
to
which
they
solicit
contributions
from
the
general
public.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
point
of
the...
the
point
on
the
line
where
the
exemption
is
drawn
is
different
for
those
organizations.
this
has
the
result
of
exempting
more
religious
organizations
than
fraternal
and
patriotic
organizations,
so
to
that
extent
it
is
a
more--
mr.
larry
salustro
--yes,
unquestionably.
it
exempts
more
religious
organizations.
mr.
larry
salustro
it's
not
a
fact,
but
i
think
it
is
a
mathematical
certainty,
because
the
fraternal
and
patriotic
organizations
that
raise
any
of
their
money
from
the
general
public
outside
their
membership
lose
their
exemption.
the
religious
organizations
can
raise
up
to
50
percent
of
the
money
from...
up
to
50
percent
of
the
money
from
the
general
public
and
not
lose
the
exemption,
so
it
is
a
more
beneficial,
a
more
hands-off
treatment
of
religious
organizations
as
a
class
than
fraternal
and
patriotic
organizations
as
a
class,
although
the
criteria
used
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
larry
salustro
well,
the
reason
that
is
advanced
by
the
state
is
that
the
state
of
minnesota
wants
to
be
more
careful
about
extending
its
regulatory
program
to
religious
organizations.
where
the
state
interest
in
those
organizations
is
small,
then
it
is
concerned
about
extending
its
regulatory
program
to
fraternal
organizations.
there
are...
we
have
a
very
different
interest
in
religious
organizations
among
themselves
in
this
program.
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
provide
information
to
donors
and
contributors
who
don't
have
that
information.
there
are
a
wide
range
of
kinds
of
charitable...
of
religious
charitable
organizations.
there
are
religious
charitable
organizations
that
solicit
exclusively
from
members
of
the
public,
100
percent
from
the
general
public.
as
far
as
our
interest
in
providing
information
to
donors
that
don't
have
it,
we
have
a
very
great
interest
in
disclosure
by
those
organizations.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
organizations
that
solicit
only
from
members
who
are
intimately
familiar
with
the
finances
of
the
organization,
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum.
we
have
much
less
interest
in
requiring
disclosure,
public
disclosure
from
those
organizations
because
the
members
who
are
the
donors
of
those
organizations
already
have
that
information
available
to
them
or
can
get
it.
mr.
larry
salustro
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
is
that
we
have
a
different...
we
have
a
relatively
lower
interest
in
some
religious
organizations
and
the
exemption
provision
is
different
because
we
want
to
leave
organizations
alone
where
our
interest
is
so
small.
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
many
cases
by
this
court,
many
charitable
solicitation
cases
by
this
court,
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
solicitation
from
the
general
public,
and
in
a
number
of
those
cases,
the
court
has...
the
court
has
looked
at
disclosure
type
programs
and
distinguished
the
kind
of
regulation
that
disclosure
type
programs
have
from
prohibitory
regulation,
and
in
the
cantwell
case
and
in
the
schaumburg
case,
and
in
some
other
cases
where
the
court
has
looked
at
this
particular
question,
it
has
determined
that
disclosure
kind
of
regulation
does
not
have
to
meet
the
same
tests
as
regulation
which
has
the
effect
of
directly
prohibiting
organizations
and
members
of
organizations
from
soliciting
contributions
from
the
general
public.
mr.
larry
salustro
charitable
organizations,
yes.
mr.
larry
salustro
they
are
different--
mr.
larry
salustro
--charitable
organizations
as
far
as
that
exemption
is
concerned
includes
the
entire
list
of
organizations.
it
includes
religious
organizations.
it
includes
fraternal
organizations.
it
includes
all
organizations
soliciting
contributions
for
charitable
purposes.
a
$10,000
limitation...
or
exemption
is
available
to
all
organizations.
it
is
available
to
religious
ones
who
are
not
exempted
by
the
other
provision.
it
is
available
to
fraternal
and
patriotic
ones
who
are
not.
so,
any
of
the
organizations--
mr.
larry
salustro
--fraternal...
any
organization,
charitable,
fraternal,
religious,
can
raise
$10,000
from
the
public
without
registering.
mr.
larry
salustro
fraternal
and
patriotic
organizations
have
two
different
criteria
for
being
exempt.
one
criteria
is
that
they
raise
all
of
their
money
from
their
members.
the
other
criteria
is,
and
completely
independent,
that
they
raise
less
than
$10,000.
the
same
is
true
with
religious
organizations.
there
are
two
different
possibilities
of
being
exempt.
one
is
raising
most
of
their
money
from
their
membership
or
affiliates.
two,
raising
up
to
$10,000.
mr.
larry
salustro
they
are
treated
better
than
fraternal
or
patriotic
organizations--
mr.
larry
salustro
--even
though
the--
mr.
larry
salustro
--yes,
or
charitable,
even
though
the
criteria
for
the
exemption
in
question
is
the
same,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
religion.
we
think
that
based
on...
well,
there
are
two
different
parts
of
the
analysis
of
the
exemption
provision.
one
is
the
decision
that
there
is
going
to
be
an
exemption
provision
for
religious
organizations.
that
kind
of
decision
takes...
takes
into
consideration
that
the
state
has
some
leeway
in
treating
religious
organizations
somewhat
better,
somewhat
more
liberally,
somewhat
more
at
a
distance
than
other
kinds
of
organizations,
and
the
court
said
in
the
walz
case
and
the
court
said
in
some
other
cases
that
there
is
some
leeway
for
the
state
to
do
that
without
necessarily
violating
the
establishment
clause.
so,
that
criteria
of
religious
organization
is
there.
the
second
question
is,
once
it
is
determined
that
there
will
be
a
religious
exemption,
how
should
the
exemption
be
structured,
and
in
minnesota's
case,
what
we
have
done
here
is
used
a
secular
criteria
to
structure
the
exemption.
the
criteria
has
nothing
to
do
with
religion,
with
religious
values,
with
the
content
of
free
speech.
the
value
is
purely
secular,
whether
the
organization
solicits
from
the
general
public.
it
is
not
only
secular,
it
is
tied
to
the
purposes
of
the
act,
which
is
providing
information
to
people
that
don't
have
information
that
receive
solicitations
from
charitable
organizations.
mr.
larry
salustro
the
state's
interest
is
different
in
this
exemption,
and
your
question
is
correct.
one
of
those
organizations
will
be
exempt
and
one
not,
and
that
is
the
way--
mr.
larry
salustro
--no,
we
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
that
one
organization
is
raising
most
of
its
money
from
the
general
public.
one
organization
is
raising
most
of
its
money
internally,
and
that
goes
to
the
extent
to
which
the
organization
can
raise
money
from
the
public
and
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
if
it
chooses
to
to
engage
in
misrepresentation.
it
is
very
correct
that
if
dollar--
mr.
larry
salustro
--if
dollar
figures,
if
dollar
criteria
would
be
different,
then
you
could
ask
me,
what
about
the
dollars
here
and
the
dollars
there,
and
doesn't
that
mean
that
one
organization
raises
95
percent
of
its
funds
internally
and
another
raises
5,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
reasonable
way
to
do
it.
there
are
other
reasonable
ways
to
do
it,
but
the
standard
that
we
have
to
find
with
this
particular
criteria
is
whether
the
line
we
have
chosen
is
not
rational,
whether
it
is
arbitrary,
whether
it
is
invidious,
and
that
comes
out
of
the
united
states
versus
gillette
test,
united
states
versus
gillette
case,
and
it
is
not
arbitrary,
and
it
is
not
invidious
merely
because
there
are
other
ways
it
could
have
been
done,
but
had
one
of
those
other
ways
been
chosen,
the
dollar
way,
then
you
would
have
exactly
the
same
opportunity
to
ask
me
that
kind
of
question.
mr.
larry
salustro
no,
i
think
the
line
can
be...
the
line
is
justified
as
being
drawn
here
because
it
is
the
place
where
a
charitable
organization
relies
primarily
on
public
funding
rather
than
primarily
on
internal
funding,
and
whether
primarily
public
funding
is
a
tiny
amount
of
money
or
whether
it
is
a
large
amount
of
money,
that
fact
remains
that
now
this
organization
relies
more
on
the
general
public
to
raise
its
funds
than
it
does
internally.
mr.
larry
salustro
we
mean
members
and
we
mean
affiliated
organizations.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
state
does
not
care
about
fraud
committed
by
organizations
on
the
members
of
the
organization.
that
is
not
the
question.
but
this
legislative
solution
goes
to
providing
information
to
people
that
don't
have
it
and
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
get
it.
without
public
disclosure,
the
general
public
does
not
have
the
opportunity
to
get
that
information.
that
is
why
it
is
important
that
it
be
supplied
as
far
as
the
general
public
is
concerned.
with
members,
members
have
the
opportunity
to
get
it,
and
it
is
not
that
we
are
not
concerned
about
fraud--
mr.
larry
salustro
--no,
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
salustro
the
point
is
drawn
at
the
place
that
it
is
drawn.
mr.
larry
salustro
we
have
a
continuum.
it
is
clear
that
at
one
end
of
the
continuum
organizations
raise
their
money
solely
from
members,
and
it's
our
position
that
we
can
stay
away
from
that
end
as
far
as
extending
this
regulatory
program
because
we
don't
have
a
sufficient
interest
arguably
to
reach
that
end
of
the
spectrum.
as
we
move
up
this
way--
mr.
larry
salustro
--because--
mr.
larry
salustro
--that
result
comes
out
of
the
particular
criteria
that
are
used.
we
don't
think,
although
the
result
appears
unusual,
we
don't
think
it
is
arbitrary.
we
don't
think
it
is
invidious,
and
we
don't
think
it
is
drawn
on
any
basis
of
religion.
mr.
larry
salustro
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
this
is
a
charitable
solicitation
law.
we
are
worried
about
matching
representations
about
what
is
going
to
be
done
with
funds
contributed
to
what
actually
is
done
with
the
funds
that
are
contributed.
members
are
going
to
be
aware
of
what
is
done
with
the
funds
contributed,
and
members
are
not
going
to
be
in
the
same
position
of
vulnerability
as
far
as
representations
made,
this
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
your
money,
as
are
strangers
to
the
organizations.
members
have
controls.
members
have
the
ability
to
see
books.
members
can
ask
questions.
members
have
a
general
idea
of
whether
the
people
that
are
running
the
organization
are
trustworthy.
mr.
larry
salustro
yes.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
larry
salustro
they
would,
your
honor,
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
that
it
can,
as
far
as
requiring
information
from
organizations,
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
that
it
can
be
more
liberal
with
religious
organizations,
that
it
can
keep
its
distance
somewhat
from
religious
organizations
where
the
state
interest
is
not
as
pronounced,
and
that
comes
out
of
the
walz
case,
among
other
cases.
the
state
can
accommodate
religious
values.
it
comes
out
of
the
religion
clauses.
it
doesn't
necessarily
come
out
of
the
first
amendment.
we
think
we
could
do
the
same
thing
with
other
first
amendment
organizations,
and
in
fact
we
do
with
the
$10,000
limitation.
we
don't
treat
them
identically.
they
can
both
have
first
amendment
rights;
if
one
organization
raises
less
than
$10,000,
it
is
exempt.
and
that
is
a
discrimination
that
is
made
on
the
same
kind
of
criteria
we
use
here.
it
is
a
reasonable
criteria.
the
lines
are
not
drawn
arbitrarily
or
invidiously,
and
we
can
treat
those
kinds
of
organizations
differently.
we
don't
have
to
put
them
all
in
one
boat.
and
that
is
what
we
do
with
religious
organizations,
but
it
happens
that
a
little
bit
some
more
of
them
are
going
to
be
exempt
because
we
are
not
interested
in
extending
regulatory
programs
to
religious
organizations
where
we
don't
think
we
have
that
interest,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
establishment
clause
requires
us
to
extend
regulatory
programs
to
religious
organizations,
to
increase
the
contact
with
religious
organizations
where
we
don't
think
we
have
a
sufficient
interest,
certainly
not
the
establishment
clause
requiring
that
we
do
that.
so
that
is
why
the
line
is
drawn
differently
for
religious
organizations.
mr.
larry
salustro
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
that.
we
would
have
some
difficulty,
and
we...
there
are
two
questions.
one
is,
would
we
have
difficulty,
would
that
be
unconstitutional
under
the
religion
clauses
as
in
some
cases
it
might
have
been
under
those
cases.
the
second
question
is,
even
if
we
don't
reach
the
limit
or
the
point
of
unconstitutionality,
can
the
state
nonetheless
draw
back
somewhat
from
that?
and
it
is
clearly
stated
in
the
walz
case,
i
think,
that
the
point
at
which
the
state
can
accommodate
religious
organizations
is
not
the
same
point
at
which
the
religion
clause,
the
free
exercise
clause
requires
that
the
state
do
that.
mr.
larry
salustro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
salustro
yes,
i
am
saying
we
may
do
that.
and
we
do
make
distinctions
between
first
amendment...
the
$10,000
limit
applies
to
first
amendment
free
speech
type
organizations
and
religious
ones,
and
we
could
do
that
across
the
board.
mr.
larry
salustro
the
legislature
could
have...
the
legislature
could
have
made
the
decision
to
do
that,
yes.
mr.
larry
salustro
we
can
regulate
religious
solicitations?
well,
cantwell
versus
connecticut
certainly
concerned
a
religious
organization.
village
of
schaumburg
didn't
concern
a
religious
organization,
but
i
am
not
clear
that
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
a
hierarchy
of
first
amendment
values,
that
religious
organizations
have
more
first
amendment
protection
than
other
free
speech
type
organizations.
so
i
think
we
can
treat
them
identically
as
charitable
organizations,
as
a
group
of
charitable
organizations,
as
the
court
did
in
walz.
it
included
the
whole
group
of
charitable
organizations
for
the
purpose
of
tax
exemption.
mr.
larry
salustro
we
are
not
prohibiting
them
from
the
duty
to
raise
money.
the
right
that
they
would
have
to
assert
would
be
the
right...
the
right
to
raise
money
from
the
general
public,
from
strangers,
and
the
right
to
refuse
to
tell
the
general
public
what
they
have
done
with
the
money.
they
have
to
assert
those
two
rights.
now,
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
there
could
be
such
a
religious
organization
that
asserts
those
rights,
but
i
think
the
proper
remedy
there
would
be
to
create
an
exemption
for
that
particular
organization
on
religious
rights
grounds,
and
not
to
throw
out
the
entire
statute
here
because
there
is
some
possible
application
in
the
future
that
is
going
to
conflict
with
religious
doctrine.
mr.
larry
salustro
well,
it
is
a
case
concerning
solicitation,
and
it
is
a
case
concerning...
well,
a
case
concerning
raising
funds
and
state
regulation.
in
that
case,
the
krishnas
could
be
treated
as
other
first
amendment
groups
were.
the
notion
that
religious
organizations
have
more
first
amendment
protection
as
far
as
raising
money
is
concerned
than
other
first
amendment
organizations
do,
that
seems
to
have
been
rejected
in
that
case.
the
other
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is
the
issue
of
whether
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
declare
this
exemption
provision
unconstitutional
on
establishment
clause
grounds.
this
argument
is
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
cases
say
that
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
plaintiffs
have
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
action
and
suffer
an
injury
which
will
be
redressed
by
a
favorable
decision.
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
in
the
court
below
is
crucial.
this
is
plaintiff's
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
is
on
appeal
here.
on
plaintiff's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
disputed
facts
are
resolved
against
the
plaintiffs.
one
of
the
disputed
facts
in
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court,
and
plaintiffs
acknowledge
it
here,
is
whether
they
are
a
religious
organization.
because
summary
judgment
is
involved,
as
a
matter
of
law
on
this
motion,
plaintiffs
are
not
a
religious
organization.
this
appeal
concerns
only
the
exemption
provision
for
religious
organizations.
only
religious
organizations
are
affected
by
it.
plaintiffs
are
not
a
religious
organization.
they
don't
suffer
injury
from
it.
mr.
larry
salustro
this
action
was
initiated
by
plaintiffs
in
federal
court.
the
action
that
we
started
in
state
court
we
alleged
that
they
were
a
charitable
organization
and
that
they
did
not
register,
and
therefore--
mr.
larry
salustro
--no,
our
pleading
in
state
court
says
that
it
is
a
charitable
organization,
and
naturally
it
is
up
to
them
if
they
decide
that
they
are
exempted
because
of
the
religious
exemption,
it
is
up
to
them
to
raise
that
point.
if
this
court
should
strike
down
the
exemption
provision
for
religious
organizations,
it
will
not
as
a
matter
of
law
do
plaintiffs
any
good
in
this
case.
we
think
this
is
a
clear
case
that
there
is
no
injury,
there
is
no
redressability,
and
there
is
no
standing.
i
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
mr.
larry
salustro
the
argument
has
been
made
here
that
our
provision,
the
criteria
has
to
be
supported
by
a
factual
inquiry.
what
was
done
below
was,
on
summary
judgment,
this
provision
was
declared
facially
unconstitutional
as
to
all
religious
organizations.
it
is
not
up
to
us
on
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
supply
facts
that
support
our
criterion
and
the
50
percent
part
of
it.
furthermore,
in
their
brief,
they
have
acknowledged
that
this
statute
has
a
rational
basis,
on
page
23
of
their
brief.
that
is
the
standard
that
comes
out
of
gillette.
if
there
is
a
secular
criteria,
if
there
is
no
religious
gerrymandering
in
the
exemption,
all
we
need
is
a
rational
basis.
there
is
a
secular
criterion
here.
there
is
no
gerrymander
here.
and
there
isn't
a
gerrymander
because
of
these
references
to
legislative
history
and
what
the
catholics
thought
and
what
the
moonies
were
doing.
in
fact,
if
you
go
through
that
material
you
will
find
there
was
a
catholic
organization,
the
pallatine
mission,
that
was
the
reason
for
this
legislation,
because
they
were
a
direct
mail
organization.
there
is
no
attempt
here
to
separate
organizations
by
who
is
controversial
and
who
is
not,
who
is
traditional
and
who
is
not.
controversial
organizations
like
the
church
of
scientology,
the
jonestown
peoples'
temple,
those
organizations
are
exempt.
traditional
organizations
like
the
pallatines
or
billy
graham
crusade,
those
organizations
are
not
exempt.
this
does
not
cut
across
controversy.
this
is
not
a
religious
gerrymander.
we
only
need
a
rational
basis.
thank
you
very
much.
