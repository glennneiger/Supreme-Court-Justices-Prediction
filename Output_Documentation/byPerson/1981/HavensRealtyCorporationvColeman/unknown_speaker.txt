unknown
speaker
before
you
get
too
far
along,
counsel,
i
hope
at
some
point
that
you
will
discuss
the
amicus
representation
to
the
court
that
there
were
certain
developments
after
the
granting
of
cert
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
because
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
ultimate
disposition.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
allen,
they
did
allege
that...
you
say
we
don't
know
where
in
richmond
they
live,
but
they
did
allege
that
wherever
they
lived,
they
were
denied
the
benefit
of
interracial
community
live
because
of
your
client's
practices.
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
was
true?
unknown
speaker
and
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
is
true,
because
we
take
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
true?
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
is,
but
why
don't
we
have
to
assume
it
is
true
when
they
allege
it,
and
then
you
prove
it
isn't
true?
unknown
speaker
you
assume
they
can
prove
what
they
have
pleaded.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
we
do
that
here?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
much
more
unlikely
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
rule
of
pleading
that
we
do
not
take
as
true
implausible
allegations?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed
before
the
bellwood
case.
unknown
speaker
so
possibly
the
respondents
in
this
case
should
have
an
opportunity
to
conform
their
complaint
to
bellwood,
would
you
not
think?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what
you
are
saying
makes
some
sense,
but
under
the
circumstances
here,
maybe
they
are
entitled
to
conform
to
bellwood.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
united
states'
position
that
the
statute
really
is
aimed
at
protecting
anybody
who
is
given
misinformation?
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
could
be
from
chicago,
and
make
these
same
inquiries
in
this
county,
and
you
would
be
a
person
aggrieved,
entitled
to
an
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
can
do
it.
he
can
call
them,
and
he
can
be
given--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
can
be
given
misinformation.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
wherever
he
lives.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
the
statute
is
aimed
at
saying,
look,
it
is
illegal
to
give
people
false
information--
unknown
speaker
--now,
if
somebody
is
giving
false
information,
then
the
only
question
is,
is
the
statute
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
true
that
these
people
were
given
false
information?
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
statute
forbid
that?
unknown
speaker
is
the
statute
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
suffered
the
very
injury
the
statute
forbids.
unknown
speaker
he
got
false
information.
unknown
speaker
he
was
given
false
information.
the
statute
forbids
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
really
making
a
jurisdictional
argument,
an
article
3
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
if
despite
what...
if
that
is
the
issue
here,
are
we
really
bound
by
the
jurisdictional
claims
that
your
opponents
made
below?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
plead
a
fact.
we
asked
and
we
were
given
false
information.
that
is
apparently
admitted.
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
respondent
here
is
entitled
to
support
the
judgment
on
that
ground,
on
an
accurate
ground,
or--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
not
going
to
enlarge
his
rights.
he
is
just
going
to
say,
there
is
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
was
there
discovery
in
this
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
was
coleman
an
employee
of
home?
unknown
speaker
you
said
yes?
unknown
speaker
does
that
affect
the
interest
of
home
in
this
case,
an
employee
was
given
false
information?
unknown
speaker
had
been
what?
unknown
speaker
both
of
them
were
home
employees?
unknown
speaker
and
home
had
a
contract
with
the
city
of
richmond?
unknown
speaker
and
what
were
the
terms
of
that
contract?
unknown
speaker
as
to
where
housing
could
be
obtained?
unknown
speaker
and
wouldn't
that
give
home
an
interest
in
the
question
that
was
put
by
coleman,
its
employees?
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
been
plead?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
allen,
paragraph
16
of
the
complaint
alleges
plaintiff
home
had
been
frustrated
by
defendant's
racial
steering
practices
in
its
efforts
to
assist
equal
access
to
housing
through
counseling
and
other
referral
services.
isn't
that
pleading
exactly
what
justice
powell
asked
you
about?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
the
answer
was,
of
course.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
no,
but
mr.
allen,
i
think
the
point
is
that
if
there
is
a
practice
of
steering,
no
matter
who
comes
to
the
real
estate
agent,
that
practice
would
impair
home's
ability...
they
say
to
someone
who
comes
into
the
office,
well,
there
is
a
vacancy
over
at
the
havens
realty
office,
go
over
there
and
apply
for
it.
if
the
person
will
not
get
the
apartment
by
doing
so,
doesn't
that
impair
home's
ability
to
refer
people
to
vacant
apartments?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
so
terrible?
i
mean,
maybe
that
is
what
the
law
could
be,
that
if
you
refer
someone
on
the
basis
of
a
vacancy,
you
have
an
interest
in
filling
vacancies,
that
you
have
a
right
to
expect
that
you
will
get
an
honest
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
notice
pleading
concept
of
the
federal
rule?
if
this
had
been
a
summary
judgment,
wouldn't
you
be
in
a
much
stronger
position
where
there
had
been
discovery
and
so
forth,
than
rather
just
to
go
off
on
the
pleadings
without
any
affidavits
or
discovery?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
individuals
involved
here,
aren't
there?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
is
defeated
if
you
plead
the
wrong
statute?
if
you
said
1331
instead
of
1343.3,
do
you
think
it
would
be
thrown
out
of
court?
unknown
speaker
if
the
facts
that
are
alleged
would
satisfy
one
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
happens
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
i
am
referring
to
804,
where
the
only
thing
you
have
to
plead
is
that
you
are
a
person,
and
that
you
have
been
given
false
information.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
bellwood
holds
that
they
wouldn't
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
under
804?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
it
doesn't
hold
it,
then,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
raised
now.
unknown
speaker
what
if
congress
had
funded
a
series
of
state
and
local
agencies
to
do
testing,
and
rather
expressly
provided
that
those
testers
were
to
be
able
to
bring
an
action
under
the
section
that
you
assail
here?
would
you
say
that
that
violated
article
3?
unknown
speaker
ms.
ruiz,
could
i
ask
you
about
your
definition
of
the
word
"community"?
would
you
think
community
as
you
have
just
used
it
could
be
extended
to
mean
the
whole
northeast
corridor
of
the
united
states,
from
boston
to
richmond?
unknown
speaker
ms.
ruiz,
isn't
there
a
provision
in
the
federal
rules
that
upon
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
you
can
ask
that
ruling
on
it
be
deferred
pending
taking
of
depositions
or
affidavits?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
suggestion
that
this
might
be
an
appropriate
case
for
exercising
discretion
to
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted
because
of
the
intervening
events,
that
is,
the
consent
decree?
unknown
speaker
that
would
leave
your
win
intact
below.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
go
into
the
district
court
and
proceed.
unknown
speaker
ms.
ruiz,
do
you
concede
that
willis
lacked
standing?
unknown
speaker
would
her
claim
be
time
barred,
however?
unknown
speaker
could
someone,
do
you
think,
come
forward
now
and
say
that
they
were
a
victim
of
a
steering
practice
in
1969
because
it
was
a
continuing
violation
and
havens
had
always
steered,
even
after
the
1968
act
made
it
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is,
you
have
used
in
your
argument
the
term
"continuing
violation",
and
the
term
"community",
both
of
which
recur
in
cases
such
as
these,
and
both
of
which
are
somewhat
amorphous,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
limitations
point,
ms.
ruiz?
which
section
of
section
3604,
which
subsection
do
you
contend
that
the
steering
practice
violates?
unknown
speaker
take
the
white
tester.
his
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
did
receive
accurate
information.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
asking--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
he
didn't.
i
am
asking
you
what
section
would
you
contend
he
can
invoke
in
order
to
be
covered
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
say
he
was
the
only
plaintiff
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
his
right
to
neutral
racial
living
conditions?
unknown
speaker
in
his
community.
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
his
own
right.
unknown
speaker
his
own
right
that
he
is
alleging.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
he
has
a
right
under
the
statute
not
to
have
that
happen.
unknown
speaker
that
is
his
claim,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
if
the
statute
had
provided
any
person
seeking
a
place
of
residence
in
good
faith,
and
then
went
on
as
it
does,
then
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
does
that
injury
have
to
occur
within
180
days
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint?
supposing
the
white
tester
moved
to
boston
181
days
before
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
would
he
still
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
moved
to
boston.
yes.
but
he
had
suffered
all
these
injuries
during
the
months
previous
to
his
move.
would
he
have
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
either
his
claim
is
barred
or
it
isn't.
what
i
am
asking
you
is,
does
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff...
must
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff
occur
within
the
180-day
period?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
if
he
moved
to
boston
five
years
ago,
but
prior
to
the
five
years
he
had
suffered
from
the
same
practice
that
continued
into
the
180-day
period,
he
could
still
sue?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
continuous
practice.
you
prove
that
they
did
it
every
week
for
five
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
did,
but
it
occurred
five
years
ago.
can
he
recover?
if
he
can't
recover
then,
why
can
he
recover
when
it
is
only
181
days
ago?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
draws
the
line
at
180
days.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
you,
though,
if
there
is
also
any
time
limit
on
when
the
injury
must
occur.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
you
can't
go
back
further
than
1968,
but
if
you
would
go
back
181
days,
i
don't
know
why
you
can't
go
back
five
years.
unknown
speaker
it
is
very
fresh.
we've
got
tape
recordings
of
everything.
unknown
speaker
ms.
ruiz,
the
solicitor
general
takes
the
position
that
the
continuing
violation
theory
does
not
apply
to
a
party
who
merely
asserts
a
right
to
receive
correct
information,
instead
of
the
neighborhood
resident
theory.
what
is
your
comment
about
the
solicitor
general's
position?
unknown
speaker
if
we
found
that
coleman...
coleman
was
the
black
lady?
unknown
speaker
if
we
found
that
coleman
had
standing,
would
we
need
to
reach
the
standing
of
anybody
else?
unknown
speaker
what
was
her
claim,
though?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
her
remedy?
suppose
it
was--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
it
was
timely?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
haven't
made
it
yet,
then.
what
is
your
point?
what
would
be
her
remedy
if
her
claim
were
timely?
