ms.
vanessa
ruiz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
a
local
fair
housing
group
and
two
individuals,
one
black
and
one
white,
who
have
engaged
in
testing
of
the
defendant's
housing
practices
have
standing
under
the
fair
housing
act
to
obtain
relief
from
the
defendant's
racially
discriminatory
housing
practices
when
the
local
fair
housing
organization
and
the
individuals
both
reside
in
the
community
that
they
claim
has
been
affected
by
these
racially
discriminatory
housing
practices,
and
have
been
the
recipients
of
racially
biased
housing
information
from
this
defendant.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
a
person
who
lives
in
boston
could
claim
that
his
community,
his
day
to
day
life,
his
day
to
day
activities,
are
affected
in
the
way
that
we
claim
that
they
have
been
affected
in
this
case
by
the
activities,
let's
say,
of
a
realtor
in
new
york.
no,
would
not
extend
it
that
far,
and
this
case
does
not
extend
that
far.
this
case
only
deals
with
the
richmond
area.
the
case
is
before
this
court
in
a
somewhat
unusual
posture,
and
it
presents
a
narrower
issue.
the
case
is
here
on
review
from
a
grant
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
standing.
therefore,
the
complaint
must
be
presumed
true
and
construed
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
complaint
was
filed
on
january
19th,
'79.
by
february
16th,
the
plaintiffs
were
out
of
court.
they
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit,
which
held
in
their
favor.
the
defendants
then
petitioned
this
court
for
review.
while
this
whole
appeals
process
was
taking
place,
however,
the
companion
case
of
paul
coles,
a
black
man
denied
housing
by
havens,
continued
on
to
discovery
and
for
trial
on
the
merits.
after
presentation
of
the
evidence
to
the
district
court,
the
judge
found,
and
i
quote
from
the
findings
of
fact,
that
"havens
realty
established
a
policy
of
discrimination
against
black
people
in
the
rental
of
its
apartments,
and
that
this
was
a
conscious
and
deliberate
policy
on
the
part
of
havens
realty.
"
because
of
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
before
this
court,
review
of
the
grant
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
finding
that
the
defendant
has
violated
the
fair
housing
act
in
section
1982,
we
believe
that
this
case
presents
only
the
issue
of
whether
these
plaintiffs,
respondents
before
the
court
here
today,
should
be
allowed
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
pick
up
where
they
left
off,
and
continue
to
prove
their
case,
that
they
are
entitled
to
relief
from
these
defendants.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
indeed,
sir,
we
requested
that.
we
requested
that
the
district
court
on
a
motion
for
reconsideration
that
the...
that
any
decision
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
be
deferred
until
the
taking
of
an
already
scheduled
deposition.
in
fact,
we
also
noted
the
fact
that
this
court
was
considering
and
would
shortly
be
deciding
the
bellwood
case,
which
would
probably
be
instructive
to
the
district
court.
that
motion
was...
that
request
was
denied.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
we
think
that
the
consent
decree
does
not
render
the
case
moot,
so
that
the
court
has
power,
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
if
it
so
wishes.
the
court
might
decide,
however,
that
it
does
not
wish
to
hear
this
case
at
this
time
because
precisely
of
the
procedural
posture,
the
somewhat
skimpy
record
that
is
available
for
review,
and
we
would
not
be
at
all
adverse
to
a
decision
that
the
writ
was
improvidently
granted.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
that's
right.
0
[generallaughter.]
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
we
would
then
go
to
the
district
court
and
proceed,
sir.
the
clear
statutory
language
of
the
fair
housing
act,
the
broad
remedial
purposes
of
the
fair
housing
act,
the
congressional
intent
expressed
in
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
fair
housing
act
for
strong
private
enforcement
of
the
fair
housing
act,
and
this
is
a
private
action,
private
plaintiffs
against
a
private
defendant,
and
this
court's
decisions
in
trafficante
and
in
bellwood
that
standing
under
the
act
is
to
be
as
broad
as
permissible
under
article
3,
require
that
these
plaintiffs
be
granted
standing
to
proceed
with
their
action.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
no.
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
mr.
willis
has
standing
based
on
his
claim
that
as
a
resident
of
the
community
affected
by
the
racial
steering
practices,
he
has
been
affected
and
injured
by
these
practices.
because
of
the
particular
facts
in
this
case,
where
mr.
willis
was
not
given
misinformation,
racially
biased
misinformation
by
havens,
we
believe
that
he
would
not
have
a
claim
under
section
804(d),
but
he
would
have
standing
as
a
resident
of
the
community
affected
by
these
practices.
ms.
coleman,
however,
was
given
such
misinformation,
and
the
statute
makes
it
unlawful
to
misrepresent
on
the
basis
of
race
to
any
person,
and
that
would
include
ms.
coleman.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
her
claim?
no,
we
don't
believe
it
would
be
time
barred,
because
the
violation
which
has
been
alleged
here
and
which
in
fact
was
found
by
the
district
judge,
is
the
policy,
on
an
ongoing
and
continuing
basis,
a
policy
of
discrimination,
a
policy
of
racial
steering.
now,
that
policy
extended
back
for
a
period
of
time,
during
the
time
when
ms.
coleman
contacted
havens
up
to
the
limitations
period,
the
180-day
period,
which
was
mr.
cole's
incident,
and
indeed,
continued
past
that,
to
1978
through
1980,
as
we
have
been
able
to
see
now,
pursuant
to
the
claims
filed
under
the
consent
order
was
the
claimants
came
forward
and
were
granted
relief
by
the
court
pursuant
to
the
magistrate's
recommendation
that
they
had
been
discriminated
by
havens
realty
during
those
times.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
in
1969,
the
action
would
have
been
unlawful.
the
claim,
if
they
could
prove
that
their
claim
was
based
on
the
same
policy
and
practice,
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
difficult
claim
to
make,
but
assuming
that
they
could,
i
think
their
claim
should
be...
should
be
heard
by
the
court.
in
a
situation
such
as
that,
of
course,
the
court
has
certain
kinds
of
discretionary
and
prudential
authority,
where
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
defendant
to
exclude
certain
claims,
but
that
again
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
incidents
that
occurred
not
a
number
of
years
back
but
a
mere
two,
three
months
before
the
coles
incident.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
they
were
put
in
this
way,
and
without
specific
reference
to
any
particular
community
or
any
particular
defendant;
they
may
seem
amorphous,
but
isn't
that,
after
all,
what
the
purpose
of
a
factual
inquiry,
of
a
trial
on
the
merits,
of
a
judicial
determination
is,
to
see
what
is
the
scope
of
this
violation,
what
is
its
nature,
how
far
has
it
extended?
again,
in
this
case,
we
have
not
had
that
opportunity,
sir.
i
would
like
to
address
the--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--yes,
justice
stevens.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
the
steering
practice,
where
it
referred
to
mr.
coles,
would
have
violated
section
804(a).
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
his
claim,
had
he
in
fact
not
received
accurate
information--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--he
did
receive
accurate
information,
right,
so
we
are
not
pressing
his
claim
under
804(d).
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
but
had
he
received
inaccurate
information
it
would
have
been
subsection
(d)
of
804.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
oh,
i
am
sorry.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
he
could
under...
actually
under
both
sections
804(a)
and
(d).
mr.
willis's
claim
in
that
case
would
be
no
different
from
the
claims
of
the
plaintiffs
in
bellwood.
there
what
they
claimed
was
that
the
rights
of
third
parties
had
been
violated.
now,
the
rights
of
those
third
parties
might
have
been
under
sections
804(a)
or
(d),
but
that
the
injury
was
to
the
plaintiffs
before
the
court.
that
would
be
in
essence
mr.
willis's
claim,
that
he
had
been
injured,
but
that
his
injury
resulted
from
the
violation
of
the
right
that
a
third
person
had
under
the
statute.
this,
in
essence,
is
this
court's
holding
in
trafficante
and
in
bellwood.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
that's
right,
his
right--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--his
right
to
live
in
a
community
that
is
normal,
that
is
stable,
that
is
not
subject--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--that
is
his
own
right.
that's
right.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
no,
that
is
his
own
injury.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
he
has
an
injury
in
that
the
community
has
been
manipulated
from
outside.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
that's
right,
because
the
statute
says--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--that
is
right.
that
is
his
claim.
i
would
like
to
address
the
argument
by
opposing
counsel
that
testers
do
not
have
standing
qua
testers.
in
fact,
we
do
not
make
that
argument,
and
we
do
not
posit
that
that
the
standing
of
willis
and
coleman
is
based
on
their
status
as
testers.
what
we
say
is
that
the
fact
that
they
engaged
in
testing
does
not
undermine
their
standing,
given
the
fact
they
have
a
good
claim
on
their
own.
this
court's
prior
decisions
concerning
standing
have
addressed
usually
two
factors.
one,
whether
the
case
is
justiciable,
and
two,
whether
there
is
adverseness
between
the
parties.
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
fair
housing
act
has
provided
a
broad
remedy
for
any
person
is
a
clear
indicator
that
the
case
indeed
is
justiciable.
the
congress
has
said
that
the
courts
should
be
hearing
this
type
of
case.
this
is,
indeed,
where
these
grievances
are
to
be
brought.
the
sole
question
then
is
whether
there
is
adverseness
between
the
parties,
is
there
a
case
or
controversy
between
these
two
parties?
is
there
injury
in
fact?
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
that's
right,
sir.
in
fact,
the
statute
requires
that
under
the
first
phrase
of
section
804(a),
but
not
as
to
any
other.
it
does
not
require
it
as
to
this.
so
the
only
requirement
is
that
there
be
an
injury
in
fact
to
these
plaintiffs
that
is
fairly
traceable,
that
is
plausibly
connected.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
the
white
tester
had
moved
to
boston.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
he
clearly
would
have
had
it
before.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
move
would
totally
mitigate...
in
fact,
he
may
be--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--no,
sir.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
housing
practice
must
have
occurred
within
the
180
days.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
i
think
that
case
would
present
other
problems.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
the
problem
might
be
that
actions,
events
subsequent
to
the
happening--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--yes,
but
the
question
would
remain
whether
there
is
an
injury
to
this
plaintiff,
and
if
he
has
moved
to--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--well,
i
would
say
that
there
is
indeed
a
difference
between
its
being
five
years
and
only
181
days.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
as
far
as
when
the
housing
practice,
the
violation
must
have
occurred--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--the
statute
does
not
provide
any
kind
of
limitation
on
when
the
injury
must
have
occurred.
now,
assume
that
going
back
you
could...
you
couldn't
go
back
further
than
1968,
which
is
when
this
policy
was
made
to
be
unlawful.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
again,
you
get
into
an
area
where
you
look
at
other
factors.
how
fresh
is
the
evidence?
i
mean,
we
are
really
talking
now--
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
--well,
if
we
have
tape
recordings,
and
there
is
absolutely
no
question
that
the
plaintiff
can
come
forward
and
prove
his
claim,
if
there
is
no
unfairness
to
this
defendant
because
it
is
one
and
the
same
practice,
and
there
has
been
a
policy,
i
would
say
yes,
he
can
bring
his
claim.
it
is
not
this
case,
but
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
logical
inconsistency
with
saying
that
claimant
could
bring
the
claim.
ms.
vanessa
ruiz
well,
i
think
that
when
we
talk
about
a
continuing
violation,
we
are
focusing
not
on
the
plaintiff
and
the
right
asserted,
but
on
the
violation
and
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
and
if
the
receipt
of
misinformation
has
been
pursuant
to
an
ongoing,
continuing
practice
that
violate
the
act,
we
contend
that
even
the
person
who
brings
an
action
under
804(d)
for
receipt
of
misinformation
is
entitled
to
have
that
claim
survive
on
a
subsequent
incident
which
is
within
the
180-day
limitations
period,
because
it
is
part
of
one
same
continuing
practice.
it
is
the
defendant's
conduct
that
we
look
to
then,
not
the
nature
of
the
claim.
this
case,
as
far
as
the
injury
claimed,
as
far
as
the
pleadings
filed,
is
really
no
different
from
the
cases
of
trafficante
and
bellwood
and
village
of
arlington
heights.
we
think
those
cases
are
consistent
with
the
fair
housing
act
and
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
fair
housing
act,
and
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
