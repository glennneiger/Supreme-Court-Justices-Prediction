mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
action
arose
pursuant
to
a
complaint
filed
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
alleging
that
petitioners,
havens
realty
and
its
employee,
rose
jones,
violated
the
fair
housing
act
and
section
1982.
as
to
these
respondents,
the
complaint
was
dismissed
on
grounds
of
lack
of
standing
and
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
fourth
circuit
reversed,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
complaint
here
provided
the
sole
facts
before
the
fourth
circuit
and
provide
the
sole
facts
before
this
court.
havens
realty
operates
two
adjacent
apartment
complexes
in
henrico
county,
virginia,
and
is
alleged
to
have
engaged
in
racial
steering
at
just
these
two
apartment
complexes.
respondent
home
is
a
richmond-based
fair
housing
organization
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
making
fair
housing
in
richmond
a
reality.
its
activities
include
counseling,
investigating
complaints,
and
testing
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
fair
housing
laws.
its
only
contact
with
petitioner
havens
was
through
its
employee
testers
to
determine
if
havens
was
complying
with
the
fair
housing
laws.
its
injury
is
alleged
as
a
frustration
to
its
counseling.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
speak
to
that.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
sir.
let
me
speak
to
that.
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
paul
allen
coles,
was
a
bona
fide
renter.
he
was
a
party
to
this
complaint.
his
complaint
withstood
the
motion
to
dismiss.
he
went
to
trial,
and
a
consent
order
was
entered
in
his
favor,
in
which
havens
was
found
to
have
been
engaged
in
racial
steering.
that
consent
order,
your
honor,
was
addressed
to
coles
and
his
class,
which
was
a
class
consisting
of
all
black
persons
deemed
to
have
been
monetarily
injured
by
those
practices.
it
can
in
no
way,
shape,
or
form
affect
the
relief
being
requested
by
these
respondents,
which
is
damages,
other
injunctive
relief
in
the
form
of
affirmative
action,
attorneys'
fees,
which
will
be
substantial.
we
submit
that
under
this
court's
stringent
test
of
mootness,
this
case
can't
be
moot.
as
to
the
contention
that
the
writ
was
improperly
granted,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
for
the
same
reasons
evidenced
in
the
cert
petition,
which
are
things
not
dealt
with
by
this
court
before,
the
tester
qua
tester
issue,
the
dispute...
the
conflict
between
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
as
to
organizational
standing,
that
those
are
questions
of
important
federal
and
constitutional
law
that
are
still
in
this
case
and
are
in
no
manner
affected
by
the
relief
granted
below.
home's
membership...
as
to
home's
membership,
we
are
told
only
that
it
is
multi
racial
and
numbers
600.
we
are
told
nothing
else
about
them,
or
where
they
live,
only
that
havens'
conduct
denied
them
the
benefit
of
interracial
associations.
the
two
individual
respondents,
sylvia
coleman,
a
black
woman,
and
kent
willis,
a
white
man,
are
home
employees.
they
were
not
in
any
way
bona
fide
apartment
seekers,
and
their
sole
reason
for
contacting
havens
was
testing.
while
we
are
not
told
precisely
where
they
live,
the
complaint
says
that
they
lived
somewhere
in
the
city
of
richmond
or
henrico
county,
and
that
havens's
steering
of
these
two
apartment
complexes
deprives
them
of
the
benefit
of
interracial
associations.
all
acts
as
between
havens
and
these
testers
took
place
more
than
180
days
before
the
complaint
was
filed.
respondents
complain
that
the
district
court's
dismissal
was
precipitous,
and
that
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
go
forward
and
demonstrate
their
standing.
we
submit
that
this
is
without
merit.
they
knew
the
facts
before
they
filed
the
complaint,
and
if
those
facts
aren't
in
that
complaint,
that
is
no
one's
fault
but
theirs.
further,
in--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
they...
well,
your
honor,
we
can
assume...
we
can
assume
that
havens
steers,
and
we
can
assume
that
they
have
properly
alleged
the
injury,
but
let
me
speak
to
that
particular
aspect
of
the
standing,
and
why
we
think
their
standing
fails
on
that
count.
all
that
these
respondents
allege
is,
havens
steers
at
two
apartment
complexes
in
henrico
county.
we
live
in
either
richmond
or
in
henrico
county.
consequently,
we
have
been
denied
the
benefit
of
interracial
association.
your
honor,
we--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
would
disagree
that
you
have
to
assume
any
essential
element
of
standing.
we
submit
that
there
has
to
be,
as
required
by
article
3,
a
plausible
connection
between
the
defendant's
acts,
between
the
defendant's
acts
and
the
plaintiff's
harm.
it
is
implausible
to
assume
that
racial
steering
directed
to
two
apartment
complexes
can
affect
two
individuals
that
live
somewhere
in
a
metropolitan
area
of
400,000
people
or
in
fact
that
they
can
affect
the
entire
metropolitan
area.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
in
bellwood,
essentially
the
same
allegations
that
these
respondents
made
were
in
the
complaint,
as
noted
in
the
footnotes
in
bellwood,
the
city
of
bellwood,
in
pleading
the
harm,
had
said
that
the
actions
of
the
defendants
affect
all
the
citizens
of
this
community.
this
court
looked
at
that
complaint
and
said,
well,
you
have
alleged
a
harm
to
one
society,
and
that
is
really
not
right,
that
is
a
generalized
grievance,
and
it
can't
possibly
be
the
defendant's
fault.
the
way
we
are
going
to
interpret
that
is,
you
have
alleged
harm
to
the
residents
of
a
very
carefully
described
12
by
13
block
target
area,
and
for
those...
for
those
plaintiffs
that
live
in
that
target
area,
we
are
going
to
assume
that
you
have
pled
a
proper
cause--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
but
in
bellwood,
for
those--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--it
is
implausible.
it
is
implausible--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
language
of
this
court
in
warth
and
in
bellwood,
that
the
standard
to
apply
to
a
complaint
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
to
be
given
the
benefit
of
all
material
allegations,
and
the
complaint
is
to
be
construed
in
his
favor.
we
think
the
connelly
v.
gibson
standard
is
wrong,
and
that
to
allow
that
standard
is
for
a
federal
judge
to
assume
that
he
has
got
the
power
to
act,
and
it
is
not
unreasonable,
not
only
not
unreasonable,
it
just
makes
sense
to
say,
if
you
have
got
standing
and
you
are
going
to
invoke
the
power
of
the
federal
fiduciary,
plead
it.
plead
the
causal
connection.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
don't
think
that
this
court
has
to
accept
the
conclusory
allegation
of
pleading
that
two
apartment
complexes...
we
live
in
a
big
metropolitan
area.
we
have
been
denied
the
benefit
of
interracial
association.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
standard--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
district
judge
employed
the
reasoning
of
topic,
which
is
wrong,
and
that
under
what
the
court
did
in
bellwood,
with
the
district
court,
had
employed
an
erroneous
standard...
standing,
that
i
can't
stand
here
and
say
in
a
final
judgment
for
the
petitioner
so
they
could--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--your
honor,
let
me
comment
on
the--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--let
me
respond
to
the
latter
part
of
the
question
first.
i
don't
think
a
person
from
chicago
can
get
on
the
phone
just
for
the
heck
of
it
and
decide
that
he
is
going
to
call
and
some
apartment
complex--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--let's
say
he
does
it.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
and
it
is
because
of
race.
let's
assume
because
of
race.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
government
is
correct
that
one
has
the
right
not
to
be
given
false
information
because
of
his
race
pursuant
to
804(d).
but
for--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--wherever
he
lives.
yes,
your
honor.
but
for
him
to
have
standing,
he
has
got
to
satisfy
article
3,
and
addressing
that
particular
point
within
the
framework--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
is
not
criminal.
it
is
not
a
criminal
statute.
it
makes
it
unlawful
to
give
false
information.
one
can
have
the
right
to
receive--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
it
does.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
statute
is
constitutional.
notwithstanding
that,
i
don't
believe
that
a
tester
qua
tester
can
demonstrate
any
injury
under
article
4.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
the
statute--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--your
honor,
he
wasn't
looking
for
accurate
information.
the
only
thing
he
was
looking--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--well,
he
was.
i
can't
deny
that.
let
me
speak
to
another
aspect
of
the
804(d)
claim,
your
honor.
this
right
under
section
804(d)
was
not
plead,
and
in
fact,
in
the
brief
that
respondent
submitted
before
the
district
court
at
page
43
of
the
appendix,
they
said,
we
are
not
suing
as
testers.
we
are
only
suing
as
persons
denied
the
benefit
of
interracial
associations.
that
is
a
disavowal
of
a
right
under
section
804(d).
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
that
you
can
plead
to
satisfy
article
3
except
facts.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
that
wasn't
raised
in
the
pleadings.
it
was
disclaimed
before
the
district
court.
before
the
fourth
circuit
it
was
never
argued,
and
your
honor,
what
will
confirm
that
the
fourth
circuit
never
relied
on
section
804(d)
is,
they
found
standing
in
kent
willis,
the
white
man,
as
a
tester
qua
tester,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
hadn't
received
any
false
information.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
i
do
not
think
he
is
entitled
to
enlarge
upon
his
rights
from
the
fourth
circuit.
i
do
not
think
he
is
entitled
to
not
plead
a
section
804(d)
violation--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
tell
you
what
it
would
have
been
like.
in
the
perry...
in
bellwood,
two
of
the
individuals,
perry
and
sharp,
lived
outside
of
the
target
area.
they
were
black
testers.
they
had
been
given
false
information,
and
they...
and
they
claimed
denial
of
the
benefits
of
interracial
association.
i
don't
think
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
come
into
this
court
for
the
first
time
and
say,
we
want
to
claim
a
section
804(d)
violation,
because
that
is
essentially
what
the
testers
here
did.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
the
issue
of
home's
representational
standing.
in
order
for
home
to
sustain
representational
standing,
it
must
plead
specific
facts
to
enable
a
determination
to
be
made
that
the
three
part
test
specified
in
warth
and
hunt
v.
washington
apple
advertising
commission
has
been
satisfied.
this
complaint
is
completely
devoid
of
any
fact
necessary
to
even
try
to
make
that
determination,
much
less
to
make
it.
consider
only
the
first
part
of
the
test,
which
is
that
at
least
one
home
member
must
have
standing
in
his
own
right
to
maintain
this
cause
of
action,
whereas
the
injuries
plead,
they...
that,
that
is,
denial
of
the
benefit
of
interracial
associations.
how
can
you
determine
that
that
one
home
member
has
standing
to
sue
when
we
don't
know
where
he
lives,
we
don't
know
how
havens'
acts
affect
him,
and
we
don't
know
whether
the...
individual
was...
will
assist?
we
submit
that
the
district
court's...
that
the
fourth
circuit's
finding
in
this
regard
is
plainly
wrong
and
must
be
reversed.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
insofar
as
home's
standing
to
sue
in
its
own
right,
it
alleges,
as
mr.
justice
white
has
been
discussing,
a
section
804(d)
claim
also.
again,
not
plead,
not
briefed,
not
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit,
up
before
this
court
for
the
first
time.
home
actually...
now
its
primary
standing
argument
has
become
section
804(d).
804(d)
is
the
right
to
receive
accurate
information,
and
if
you
receive
false
information,
your
rights
have
been
violated.
it
ought
to
be
very
clear
that
havens
has
not
violated
home's
section
804(d)
rights.
he
didn't
even
know
home
was
involved.
and
he
cannot
be
held
to
have
violated
those
rights
because
he
didn't
give
home
any
false
information
based
on
rights.
this
point
is
noted
in
the
government's
brief,
where
it
says
if
home
had
contacted
havens
and
said,
i
am
home,
or
a
home
employee
had
contacted
havens
and
said,
i
am
a
home
employee,
and
it
got
false
information,
it
would
have
been
a
different--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
if
that
false...
if
the
information
had
been
sought--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--sought
for
a
bona
fide
purpose,
in
other
words,
if
sylvia
coleman
and
kent
willis,
who
were
home's...
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
introduce
them.
coleman
and
willis
were
home
employees.
they
were
not
bona
fide
apartment
seekers.
they
were
just
testing
agents.
that
was
their
sole--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
that
was
their
sole
involvement.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
terms
of
that
contract
was
that
home
was
to
counsel
so
many
people
with
respect
to
the
city,
provide
services
to
the
city--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--generally,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
it
could
have
if
it
had
been
plead.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
if
it
had
been
plead.
the
facts
that
are
plead
are
that
coleman
and
willis
never
sought,
nor
did
home,
to
obtain
any
bona
fide
information
from
havens.
they
never
at
any
time
called
havens--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--and
said,
tell
me
what
you
have
got
available.
all
they
did
was
test.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
yes.
let
me
comment
upon
that.
here
is
what
home
pleads.
home
says,
we
thought
havens
was...
this
is
the
complaint.
this
is
no
extrapolation.
we
tested
havens.
we
found
he
was
steering
therefore,
we
are
damaged.
now,
what
is
the
causal
connection?
because
again
it
is
a
conclusory
pleading.
does
it
follow
that
just
because
havens
is
steering,
there
is
damage
to
home's
counseling
service?
and
the
answer
is,
of
course
not.
consider
that
you
have
a--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--let
me
explain,
and
maybe
i
can
change
your
mind.
consider
a
bona
fide
black
apartment
seeker,
never
heard
of
home,
and
he
goes
to
havens,
and
he
is
steered.
has
home
been
damaged?
of
course
not.
what
has
happened?
what
has
happened
is
that
its
abstract
concern
with
fair
housing
has
been
thwarted.
no
question
about
that.
is
that
the
type
of
damage
that
will
sustain
an
article
3
standing?
the
answer
is,
of
course
not.
suppose
that
black
bona
fide
apartment
seeker
is
referred
to
havens--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
that
were
so,
that
would
give
every
apartment
locator
service
in
richmond
a
cause
of
action
in
every
case
where
racial
steering
or
violation
ever
brought
without
alleging
that
they
were
hurt
by
it.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
in
looking
at
violations
in
the
fair
housing
act,
the
usual
starting
place
is
what
was
the
congressional
intent.
the
legislative
history
is
of
zero
help
here
because
it
is
obvious
that
congress
was
only
considering
the
direct...
the
people
who
were
directly
discriminated
against.
you
can't
get
any
help
from
the
legislative
intent
as
to
whether
they
intended
to
benefit
the
indirect
victims,
much
less
fair
housing
organizations
and
testers.
we
just
can't
tell.
so
i
can't
stand
here
and
talk
about
legislative
intent
because
i
don't
know.
what
i
can
talk
about
is
article
3,
and
unless
home
can
demonstrate
that
this
steering
harms
its
counseling
service,
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
avoid
the
reasoning
of
the...
which
is
what
he
seeks
to
do.
the
seventh
circuit
in
bellwood,
speaking
to
similar
allegations,
said
that
the
alleged
injury,
because
they
plead
similar
injury,
is
a
natural
concomitant
of
and
so
inextricably
intertwined--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
thank
you.
the
seventh
circuit
in
bellwood
addressed
similar
standing
questions
with
respect
to
a
fair
housing
organization
there
known
as
leadership
council,
that
made
pleadings
similar
to
those
made
here,
and
concluded
that
its
alleged
injury
was
just
the
natural
concomitant
of
and
so
intertwined
with
its
abstract
concern
as
to
be
inseparable
for
article
3
purposes,
and
we
submit
that
that
rationale
is
applicable
here.
unless
the
standing
requirement
is
satisfied,
simply
because
havens
is
steering,
there
is
no,
absolutely
no
facts
plead
to
support
a
causal
connection
between
that
steering
and
its
counseling
service.
admittedly,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
there
is
a
conclusory
allegation
that
they
were
harmed.
there
are
no
facts
plead
that
any
home
client
was
ever
sent
to
this
apartment
complex,
that
home
ever
sought
any
information
for
this
complex.
as
justice
powell
noted,
they
had
the
duty
to
get
information
but
they
never
called,
they
never
called
havens
and
said--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
i
don't
believe
the
concept
of
noticed
pleading
ought
to
be
applicable
to
standing.
standing
is
a
jurisdictional
matter,
and
in
order
to
invoke
the
power
of
the
federal
court,
there
ought
to
be
facts
that
distinctively
and
affirmatively
show
that
the
federal
court
has
got
power,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
idea
of
noticed
pleading,
where
the
plaintiff
is
just
supposed
to
put
the
defendant
generally
on
notice
of
what
the
claim
is
about,
ought
to
be
the
same
standard
when
you
are
talking
about
standing.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
a
motion--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
it
would
happen,
because
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--well,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
it
would
be
called
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
to
the
plaintiff's
attention
and
would
be
corrected,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
we
are
talking
about
pleading
facts.
you
are
referring
to
a
technical
area.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
if
that
standard...
if
that
is
the
standard
that
governs
this
court,
then
with
respect
to
two
testers
in
bellwood
who
lived
outside
the
area,
they
would
not
have
been
denied
standing.
in
that
particular
case,
they
were
testers.
they
were
given
false
information.
they
did
not
plead
804(d).
when
they
got
to
this--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--it
holds--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--it
didn't
address
the
question,
because--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--no,
it
doesn't.
it
was
never
addressed,
and
your
honor,
my
point
is
here,
it
was
never
raised
in
this
case
until
it
came
to
this
court.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
let
me
turn
to
the
testers.
the
fourth
circuit
found
standing
for
the
testers
on
two
grounds,
first,
as
surrogates
raising
the
rights
of
third
parties,
and
secondly
as
individuals
denied
the
benefit
of
interracial
associations.
we
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit
reliance
on
pierson
and
evers
is
wrong,
that
the
emphasis
is
misplaced.
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases
had
standing
because
they
had
injuries,
not
because
they
were
tested,
and
the
testing
motive
is
absolutely
irrelevant
for
standing
purposes.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
granted
standing
as
a
tester
qua
tester
without
regard
to
any
allegation
of
injury,
its
reasoning
being
the
broad
public
policy
of
the
fair
housing
act.
that
flies
in
the
face
of
article
3,
and
cannot
be
sustained.
now,
before
this
court,
respondents
have
abandoned
the
tester
qua
tester
issue.
they
no
longer
argue,
as
the
fourth
circuit
held,
that
kent
willis
has
standing.
they
only
argue
for
sylvia
coleman's
standing
on
the
basis
of,
as
mr.
justice
white
has
said,
her
804(d)
claim.
still,
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
with
respect
to
tester
qua
tester
standing
is
still
there
and
has
to
be
corrected--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--i
would.
i
would
say...
i
would
say
that...
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
congress
can't
create
an
agency
and
give
that
agency
enforcement
power.
but
to
allow
that
agency
to...
and
i
think
this
is
perhaps
the
way
to
answer
it...
to
enforce
the
same
rights
that
private
individuals
could
enforce...
for
example,
section
813,
i
believe,
gives
the
attorney
general
certain
rights
with
respect
to
practices
and
patterns,
et
cetera.
that
is
okay.
but
i
think
it
would
violate
article
3
for
congress
to
set
up
an
independent
agency
and
to
say,
you
know,
go
get
them
on
civil
grounds.
yes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
to
start
with
counsel's
last
point,
it
was
that
this
case
is
like
trafficante
and
bellwood,
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
that's
absurd.
trafficante
allowed
persons
injured
by
discrimination
against
others
to
assert
the
rights,
and
we
were
talking
about
an
apartment
complex,
where
the
act
of
discrimination,
the
racial
manipulation
was
at
that
apartment
complex.
bellwood
changed
it
a
bit,
because
in
bellwood
you
had
a
village
of
20,000
people,
and
you
had
a
fairly
sizeable
area
within
that
village
of
12
to
13
blocks,
and
notwithstanding
that,
the
court
had
some
difficulty
and
in
fact
refrained
from
allowing
standing
for
two
plaintiffs
that
lived
outside
of
that
target
area.
now
what
we
have
done
is,
we
have
contracted
the
target
area
down
to
two
apartments,
and
we
have
expanded
the
size
of
the
area
that
the
people
can
live
in
to
a
whole
metropolitan
area.
this
is
a
quantum
leap
from
bellwood.
and
if
it
goes
that
far,
where
does
it
stop
next?
in
reading
the
bellwood
oral
arguments,
one
question
from
the
bench
was,
where
does
this
end?
and
if
we
lived
in
northern
illinois,
and
we
don't
like
what
is
going
on
in
bellwood,
can
we
complain
about
it?
and
the
answer
was,
oh,
no.
oh,
no.
we
are
going
to
be
reasonable
about
this,
and
we
are
only
going
to
deal
with
an
area
that
is
affected.
another
question
asked
from
the
bench
in
bellwood
is,
how
many
private
attorney
generals
are
we
talking
about?
well,
in
richmond,
virginia,
if
this
complaint
is
upheld,
you
are
talking
about
400,000.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
question
was
raised,
well,
should
we
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
and
opposing
counsel
says,
well,
we
just
want
to
go
back
and
amend.
it
has
been
admitted
that
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
tester
qua
tester
is
wrong.
that
needs
to
be
changed.
that
can't
be
left
standing
by
dismissing
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted.
the
representational
standing.
the
facts
are
not
in
that
case
to
support
representational
standing,
and
no
one
can
say
that
they
are.
thirdly,
this
decision
by
the
fourth
circuit
is
such
a
far
step
from
bellwood
that
it
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
stand.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised,
well,
you
know,
why
didn't
you
move
to...
why
didn't
you
move
to
be
given
the
right
to
furnish
information
later?
the
point
was,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
had
this
opportunity.
when
the
defendant
moved
to
dismiss
this
case,
they
had
an
opportunity
then
to
supply
whatever
facts
they
wanted
to
supply.
they
have
had
no
difficulty
supplying
them
in
this
brief
before
this
court
for
the
first
time.
the
important
thing
to
note
here
is
that
these
respondents
wanted
to
stand
on
this
complaint.
they
wanted
this
district
court
to
accept
the
broad
allegations
in
this
complaint
and
that
is
why
they
plead
it.
that
is
why
they
had
final
judgment
entered
under
rule
54,
and
that
is
why
they
have
appealed.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
inadvertently
doing
anything
wrong.
this
was
a
deliberate
effort
to
have
these
broad
allegations
accepted
by
the
district
court.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
your
honor,
yes,
you
would,
because
coleman's
claim
under
section
804(d)
is,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
absolutely
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
receipt
of
false
information
is
a
claim
personal
to
the
recipient.
and
i
don't
see
how
the
statute
can
be
interpreted
any
other
way
than
that
she
has
got
180
days
from
the
day
she
gets
that
wrong
information
to
bring
that
claim,
and
to
allow
that
to
slid
in
under
a
continuing
violation
theory
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
so
you
do
have
to
reach--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--her
claim
was--
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
is
my
point.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
that
is
my
point.
mr.
everette
g.
allen,
jr.
the
point
is,
she
hasn't
been
injured,
and
she
doesn't
care
about
any
relief.
she
received
this
information
solely
to
test.
she
got
false
information,
but
the
point
is,
what
does
she
care?
she
is
just
doing
her
job.
that
is
not
an
entry
under
article
3,
and
that
is
why
she
doesn't
have
standing
pursuant
to
article
3.
she
hasn't
been
injured.
