mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
23
amici
states,
including
colorado,
who
believe
that
home
rule
cities
should
not
have
state
action
antitrust
immunity
in
the
circumstances
which
exist
in
this
case.
in
the
view
of
the
amici
states--
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
--this
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
attend
to
address
the
state
action
question,
your
honor.
in
the
view
of
the
amici
states,
the
state
action
immunity
issue
presented
here
is
whether
in
the
absence
of
any
competition
displacement
policy
or
supervision
by
the
state
itself,
and
based
solely
on
the
grant
of
general
home
rule
self
governing
authority,
the
actions
and
policies
undertaken
by
home
rule
cities
on
their
own
initiative
can
satisfy
the
test
for
state
action
immunity
which
this
court
has
previously
articulated.
now,
the
amici
states
have
an
interest
in
this
question
because
they
are
desirous
of
securing
the
benefits
of
competition
to
their
citizens
through
broad
application
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws
and
also
the
state
antitrust
laws
which
in
many
instances
are
construed
in
accordance
with
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question,
it
is
to
what
extent
should
these
decisions
be
left
to
the
localities.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
amici
states,
the
provisions
of
the
home
rule
constitutions
are
not
themselves
meaningless,
but
there
are
really
two
separate
questions
that
are
involved
here.
one
has
to
do
with
the
allocation
of
power
between
the
state
and
its
political
subdivisions
through
home
rule
powers
or
otherwise,
and
the
other
matter
that
is
at
issue
here
is
the
national
competition
policy
that
is
embodied
in
the
antitrust
laws,
and
these...
this
sort
of
collision
has
occurred
before,
as
your
honor
knows,
three
years
ago
in
the
city
of
lafayette
case
before
this
court.
in
the
views
of
the
amici
states,
the
states
themselves
are
free
to
allocate
power
by
means
of
home
rule
to
their
municipalities.
when
they
do
that,
they
may
do
it
in
a
certain
way
which
may
result
in
antitrust
immunity
under
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
or
they
may
do
it
in
a
way
which
does
not
manifest
antitrust
immunity.
if
they
choose
the
latter
course,
then
those
municipalities,
when
they
exercise
the
powers
that
have
devolved
on
them
through
the
state
constitution
should
do
so
in
a
way
that
complies
with
the
antitrust
laws.
the
amici
states
view
that
as
the
appropriate
balance,
really,
your
honor,
between
the
state
powers
and
the
federal
national
competition
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
no,
your
honor.
i
am
arguing
exactly
the
other
side
of
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
that
is
exactly
our
position.
in
that
regard,
your
honor
had
asked
previously
what
would
have
sufficed
here,
and
i
think
i
can
address
that
question.
in
the
view
of
the
amici
states,
the
narrowest
ground
for
decision
by
this
court
would
be
that
there
was
simply
no
contemplation
here
that
the
home
rule
city
of
boulder
should
engage
in
the
kind
of
anti
competitive
activity
alleged
in
this
instance.
there
is
nothing
expressed
in
the
state
constitutional
provisions
conferring
power
on
boulder
that
indicates
that
it
should
engage
in
this
kind
of
activity.
that
brings
up
the
question
then
whether
that
kind
of
power
should
be
implied.
in
the
view
of
the
amici
states,
it
should
only
be
implied
if
it
is
necessary
to
effectuate
a
state
regulatory
scheme,
and
in
this
instance
there
is
no
state
regulatory
scheme.
in
the
view
of
the
amici
states
then,
the
question
can
be
resolved
right
there
for
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
your
honor,
i
think
they
could.
the
tenth
circuit
in
boulder
two
has
basically
said,
as
we
have
argued
all
along,
that
cable
tv
is
an
area
of
mixed
state
and
local
concern.
in
that
situation,
both
the
state
can
legislate
on
it,
as
the
tenth
circuit
has
recognized,
and
the
city
can,
and
as
long
as
there
is
no
conflict,
both
sets
of
regulations
can
exist.
if
there
is
a
conflict,
the
state
policy
would
predominate
in
that
situation.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
if
the
municipality
decided
to
completely
prohibit,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
get
more...
that's
a
different
situation
from
this
case...
that
would
get
more
into
an
area
where
the
municipality
might
be
free
to
act,
but
that
is
a
different
question
from
the
antitrust
immunity
question
here.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
yes,
your
honor.
i
think...
i
think
that
the
city
conceivably
could
do
that,
but
there
would
be
first
amendment
concerns
if
they
were
to
do
it,
but
what
we
have
envisioned
as
sort
of
a
hypothetical
construct,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
way
that
state
action
immunity
could
be
achieved,
is
that
there
should
be
a
competition
displacement
policy
clearly
articulated,
affirmatively
expressed,
and
actively
supervised
by
the
state,
coming
from
the
state
in
a
particular
subject
matter
area,
such
as
cable
tv.
the
implementation
of
that
policy
could
be
left
at
the
local
level,
to
the
municipalities,
as
long
as
there
was
oversight
and
review
by
the
state
itself.
there
are
approximately
eleven
states,
your
honor,
that
do
have
oversight
of
cable
tv
on
a
statewide
basis,
and
i
think
more
than
half
of
those
allow
the
municipalities
to
have
a
significant
amount
of
input
in
that
area.
when
you
get
into
a
matter
of
an
area
of
mixed
state
and
local
concern,
and
this
may
correct
what
i
said
previously
if
i
misspoke,
in
an
area
of
mixed
concern,
if
the
city
statute
conflicted
with
the
state
law,
the
city's
ordinance
conflicted
with
the
state
statute,
the
state
statute
would
prevail,
so
that
if
the
city
tried
to
legislate
cable
tv
out
of
existence,
there
would
be
a
good
chance
that
that
would
not
control.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
if
it
conflicted
with
the
state
statute,
your
honor,
under
colorado
law,
and
if
it
were
an
area
of
both
municipal
and
state
concern,
the
state
statute
would
predominate.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
but
it
would
not
conflict,
your
honor,
because
the
state
statute
conveys
so
called
unlimited
power
only
on
purely
local
and
municipal
matters.
that
is
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
yes,
your
honor.
in
that
instance,
in
our
view,
if
the...
if
the
state
legislation
conformed
to
the
state
constitution,
and
were
not
itself
violative
of
the
state
constitution,
it
would
generally
control.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
me,
could
the
city
do
it,
and
i
think
i
may--
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
--i
may
have
misspoke
in
answer
to
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
my
ultimate
answer
is
that
i
think
that
is
an
area
of
mixed
state
and
local
concern,
and
the
state
law
would
predominate,
and
if
there
were
a
conflict
on
it--
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
cable
tv
also
has
interstate
implications,
as
this
court
is
well
aware
from
its
prior
decisions.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor,
and
if
i
could
just--
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
contemplation--
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
--that
does
not
do
that.
a
constitutional
home
rule
provision
could,
in
our
view,
your
honor,
go
to
the
contemplation
standard
or
the
compulsion
standard
that
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
city
of
lafayette,
but
it
would
have
to
be
more
specific
than
this
one
to
do
that,
and
then
there
would
need
to
be
some
comprehensive
state
policy
in
the
form
of
legislation
besides.
i
might
just
point
out
that
the
amici
states
feel
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
fact
that
if
the
home
rule
municipalities
across
the
country,
which
number
in
the
thousands,
are
able
themselves
to
satisfy
the
state
action
immunity
tests,
then
the
national
competition
policy
will
be
severely
impaired.
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
no,
35,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
--that
have
home
rule
provisions.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
chart
to
the
petitioner's
brief--
mr.
thomas
p.
mc
mahon
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
nine
states
that
have
powers
like
colorado's
and
a
total
of
35
where
if
the
city
is
exercising
authority
in
a
particular
local
area
and
there
is
no
conflicting
state
legislation,
the
city
can
occupy
the
field
in
that
instance.
thank
you.
