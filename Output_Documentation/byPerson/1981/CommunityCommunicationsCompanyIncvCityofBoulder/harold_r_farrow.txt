mr.
harold
r.
farrow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
a
cable
television
operator.
as
such
a
business,
it
is
a
medium
of
communication,
supplying
news,
information,
and
entertainment.
this
includes
the
origination
of
programs
as
well
as
rebroadcast
of
broadcast
signals
and
the
performance
of
editorial
functions.
so,
as
we
look
at
it
from
the
restraint
of
trade
problems,
we
are
dealing
with
a
restraint
of
trade
and
business
in
the
commerce
of
ideas.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
we
are
arguing
an
antitrust
exemption
or
pre
emption
in
terms
of
a
restraint
of
the
first
amendment
trade.
i
don't
think
we
can
separate
the
two.
as
i
understand,
it
is
the
posture
of
the
court
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
antitrust
you
deal
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
industry
and
the
nature
of
the
particular
restraint,
and
so
i
don't
think
as
we
deal
with
the
question
of
exemption
we
can
ignore
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
first
amendment...
trade
and
commerce
under
the
first
amendment.
that
is
certainly
our
posture
in
the
case.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
would
assume
that
the
advertiser
would
have
access
to
either
one
of
the
transit
companies.
the
transit
companies
are
dealing
with
a
franchise.
i
think
the
concept,
the
connotation
of
franchise
in
terms
of
cable
television
is
totally
inappropriate.
it
implies
a
special
privilege.
for
example,
your
transit
car
had
one
half
of
the
town,
it
had
a
special
privilege.
the
advertiser,
though,
he
had
access
to
either
one
of
those
fellows.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
you
are
equating
public
utility
type
activity,
commercial
type
activity,
if
you
want
to,
with
the
trade
of
first
amendment,
and
you
are
equating
a
business
that
ought
to
be
licensed
and
free
for
all,
subject
to
reasonable
restrictions,
to
a
business
that
is
a
special
privilege.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
because
i
think...
because
there
is
a
current
trend
among
some
of
the
cities
in
recent
years
to
take
the
posture
that
because
we
are
the
guardians
of
the
streets,
the
proprietors
of
the
streets,
the
landlords
of
the
streets,
we
can
elect
and
say
that
we
are
going
to
choose
one
monopolist
who
only
that
monopolist
can
be
in
the
cable
television
business
and
purvey
the
trade
of
information,
news
and
information.
i
think
that
is
totally
wrong.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
well,
i
think
that
it
is
different
in
this
respect,
that
one
deals
specifically
with
land
use.
as
such,
it
is
a
traditional
area
of
government
regulation.
it
must
have
some
rational
basis,
and
whatever,
and
what
have
you,
but
let's,
instead
of
talking
about
theaters,
let's
talk
about
newspapers.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes.
as
to
theaters,
if
there
were
some
logical
reason
why
that
you
had
to
put
them
1,000
feet
apart,
as,
for
example,
they
had
a
demonstrated
cause
and
fact
of
producing
some
evil
that
you
wanted
to
cure,
such
as
a
red
light
district,
as
i
think
happens,
then
the
question
of
the
zoning
power
to
say,
you
can
all
be
in
the
theater
business
but
you've
got
to
keep
a
little
distance
between
yourselves,
seems
like
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction,
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
here--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--for
theater
licenses.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
well,
i
would
think
that
when
that
happened,
then
the
price
of
theaters
would
go
up,
and
he
who
wanted
to
be
in
the
theater
business
would
go
out
and
buy
out
an
existing
theater,
pay
a
higher
price,
but
not
be
excluded
from
the
market
just
because
he
owned
another.
if
there
is
only
room
for
15
of
them,
and
the
price,
like
liquor
licenses,
go
up,
he
still
is
there.
you
don't
have...
you
don't
have
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case
is,
we
are
dealing
with
no
time,
no
place,
no
manner,
no
how
is
this
company
allowed
to
do
business
in
two
thirds
of
the
city,
and
the
only
justification
we
have
for
it
is
is
that
it
might
be,
it
might
be
a
natural
monopoly,
and
i
think
it
is
just...
it
is
extraordinarily
different
from
the
circumstance
of
a
couple
of
theaters.
i
think
that
one
of
the
confusions
we
deal
with
in
this
thing
is,
we
forget
the
nature
of
the
particular
regulation
here
involved.
we
are
not
dealing
with
any
kind
of
traditional
zoning
law,
like
public
utility
regulation
or
commercial
regulation,
or
selling
raisins,
or
even...
we
are
not
even
dealing
with
a
question
of
regulation
of
cable
television,
because
there
is
not
a
single
regulation
adopted
yet
about
how
you
conduct
the
business
of
cable
television.
we
are
not
dealing
with
safety.
there
is
no
issue
of
safety
involved.
we
are
not
dealing
with
whether
or
not
you
steal
from
your
customers.
we
are
not
saying
that
you
can't
go
out
and
electrocute
your
customers,
or
scare
the
horses,
or
anything
of
that
sort.
we
are
dealing
with
a
decision
that
one
city
makes
that
says
we
think
there
might
be
a
natural
monopoly,
and
you,
this
particular
company,
almost
like
a
bill
of
pains
and
penalties,
you
may
not
even
think
about
operating
over
there.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would
take
the
most
extraordinary
kind
of
a
justification
to
do
that,
and
the
only
one
i
know
of
in
the
case
law
is
those
dealing
with
physical
impossibility,
but
in
this
case
we
have
both
in
boulder...
pardon
me,
mache
one
and
again
in
mache
two,
specific
findings.
there
is
no
physical
impossibility.
there
is
no
physical
impediment.
not
only
is
there
room
for
four
on
the
poles,
but
after
that
you
can
go
underground
and
you've
got
all
the
ground
from
here
to
china.
so
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
physical
shortage
or
whatever.
the
suggestion
that
we
are
dealing
with
economic
scarcity
is
a
justification
for
that.
i
think
it
is
brand
new
to
the
whole
concept
of
first
amendment
freedoms.
brand
new.
and
while
we
are
touching
that
point,
i
think
one
of
the
extraordinary
things
is
in
boulder,
too,
now,
which
has
now
clarified
its
holding
in
boulder
one
dealing
with
the
antitrust
issue
and
then
brought
up
this
question
of
economic
scarcity.
we
have
this
funny
situation
where
the
appellate
court
has
twice
now
set
aside
or
ignored
the
specific
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
without
reviewing
the
trial
court
record.
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
nobody
but
judge
markey
has
ever
looked
at
the
record
other
than
judge
mache.
in
that
record,
in
that
very
record
dealing
with
economic
scarcity,
there
is
a
document
there
produced
by
bcc,
the
co
conspirator,
put
in
evidence
by
the
city
of
boulder,
which
contains
a
five
year
economic
projection
of
bcc.
now,
you
remember
that
bcc
were
the
people
who
said
in
july
of
1979,
give
us
a
permit,
we
are
prepared
today
to
compete
with
this
company,
and
the
city
said,
no,
no,
we
want
to
stop
and
think
about
it.
we
are
going
to
think
that
maybe
it's
a
natural
monopoly,
and
then
make
it
a
natural
monopoly,
or
make
it
an
unnatural
monopoly.
that
piece
of
paper
in
there,
that
five
year
projection,
demonstrated
that
bcc
anticipated
putting
$1.3
million
in
equity
in
year
one
and
none
thereafter.
in
the
fourth
year,
they
anticipated
a
$3.9
million
distribution
to
the
partners,
and
as
of
the
time
they
anticipated
distribution
they
would
have
recovered
all
but
$45,000
of
their
$1.3
million
by
depreciation,
by
the
recapture
of
capital,
and
they
would
still
own
a
business
that
in
its
fifth
year
they
anticipated
would
produce
$85,000
worth
of
taxable
net
income,
and
$490,000
more
worth
of
cash
flow.
now,
you
know,
evidence
of
economic
scarcity
is
just
not
there.
the
contrary
is
there.
that
is
why
we
say,
you
know,
that
the
major
error
with
this
case
and
the
finding
in
the
major
distribution
areas
is
that
the
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
has
refused
to
review
the
record,
refused
to
look
at
the
record.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
understand.
i
think
that...
of
course,
i
can't
guess
why
you
took
the
case.
i
would
think
there
are
two
logical
reasons.
one
is,
it
does
deal
with
the
cable
television
industry,
which
is
an
emerging
first
amendment
speaker,
and
is
of
very
significant
national
import,
and
there
are
certainly
current
abuses
being
reported
daily
in
the
press
of
this
concept
of
the
rfp
process.
the
other
thing
is,
we
have
the
concept
that
a
city
in
the
state
of
colorado
has
apparently
decided
that
because
it
is
a
home
rule
city,
that
it
is...
it
is
the
sovereign,
and
free
to
take
the
kind
of
action
it
took,
apparently
on
the
theory
that
because
it
represents
directly
the
people
of
the
state
by
its
constitutional
stature,
it
has
the
power,
and
then
of
course
it
supervises
it,
it
satisfies
the
tests
of
lafayette
and
midcalf.
well,
it
got
that
lofty
status,
if
it
got
it
at
all,
by
virtue
of
that
state
constitution,
and
that
state
constitution
says
in
it,
i
think
it
is
article
10,
section
2,
that
constitution...
"no
law
shall
be
passed
impairing
the
freedom
of
speech.
"
"every
person
shall
be
free
to
speak,
write,
or
publish
whatever
he
will
on
any
subject,
being
responsible
for
all
abuse
of
that
liberty.
"
so,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
a
city
who
claims
its
power
to
come
from
that
constitution
can
say
that
same
constitution
contemplated
to
be
able
to
pass
something
it
calls
a
law
that
totally
locks
out
a
given
speaker
from
two
thirds
of
a
city,
at
the
same
time
saying
they
are
going
to
hold
that
two
thirds
open
so
they
can
select
another
monopolist
which
they
can
totally
control.
i
just
don't
believe
there
is
any
contemplation,
or
any
mandate.
i
think
that
is
a
clear
prohibition.
now,
in
boulder
two,
we
have
judge
seymour,
i
guess
it
is,
who
says
in
her
footnote
number
3,
we
didn't
say
it
was
purely
local
in
boulder
one.
i
misunderstood
her.
i
thought
that's
what
they
were
saying,
and
apparently
everybody
else
thought
that,
because
that's
the
point
that
is
briefed
throughout
these
cases.
but
if
she
didn't
say
that,
what
she
was
saying
then
is
that
there
is
a
local
interest
and
a
state
interest,
and
if
there
is
a
local
interest
and
a
state
interest,
then
of
course
any
state
action
in
the
matter
is
controlling.
now,
there
is
no
specific
state
statute
dealing
with
cable
television,
but
there
are
two
things
that
clearly
control.
one
is
the
state
antitrust
statute,
which
recognizes
its
policy
of
pro
competition.
and
the
other
thing
is
the
state
constitution,
which
forbids
it,
just
like
it
forbids
the
city
of
boulder--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no,
sir.
i
think
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
struggle
with
the
inner
workings
of
cities
versus
states.
i
think
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
an
implementation
of
the
national
policy
of
antitrust,
and
the
national
policy
of
antitrust
as
it
affects
the
first
amendment
in
particular,
and
i
am
saying
that
no
matter
how
colorado
internally
wants
to
rearrange
its
organization
is
of
no
interest
either
to
us
or
to
you.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
we
did
that,
your
honor,
i
meant
to
do
that
in
connection
with
the
lafayette-midcalf
test,
which
indicates
where
the
city
claims
the
exemption
or
pre
emption
or
immunity
of
the
state
if
it
can
demonstrate
the
state
made
it
do
it,
and
it
is
in
contemplation
of
what
the
state
wanted
to
do,
and
the
point
of
the
demonstration
is,
the
state
didn't
make
it
do
what
it
did,
nor
did
the
constitution,
nor
did
the
constitution
contemplate
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
constitution
and
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
state
seem
to
me
to
prohibit
the
very
kind
of
activity
we
are
talking
about,
so
that
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
possibility
that
the
city
of
boulder
can
say
whether
it
is
the
agent
or
the
state
of
colorado,
as
being
the
legislature
and
the
governor,
or
whether
it
is
an
agent
of
the
state
of
colorado
as
being
the
people
who
adopted
the
constitution,
no
matter
who
the
basic
source
is,
the
direction
is
the
contrary,
the
opposite
of
what
they
claim,
and
there
is
no
justification,
i
believe,
for
this
type
of
activity.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
well,
it--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--it
is.
it
is
in
a
very
fluid
state.
i
think
it
is
reflected
by
the
fluidity
of
this
case.
we
have
five
forums
at
one
time,
concurrently.
surely
it
is
that,
but
i
think
the
problem
is
the
form
of
experimentation
that
we
are
taking
is
in
clear
derogation
of
both
the
national
policy
of
antitrust
and
the
national
first
amendment
rule.
and
i
say
that
because
what
has
happened,
this
process
that
is
developing,
and
the
process
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
process
in
which
the
city
says,
i
own
the
streets,
i
am
the
proprietor
of
the
streets,
i've
got
my
toll
gate
between
you,
the
speaker,
and
the
people
who
want
to
be
customers,
and
if
you
want
to
do
business
in
my
town
we
are
going
to
do
it
on
an
rfp
basis.
you
give
me
a
request
for
proposals,
and
then
i
am
going
to
shop
among
you,
and
i
am
going
to
find
which
of
you
will
pay
the
most
in
money
or
in
services,
but
most
important
of
all,
and
most
extraordinary
of
all,
in
subservience.
which
of
you
will
promise
you
won't
sue
me?
which
if
you
will
waive
your
rights
to
get
into
the
business?
which
of
you
will
sign
a
contract
that
says
that
i
can
forever
control
your
programming?
that
is
the
process
we
are
dealing
with,
and
that
is
exactly
the
process
we
are
having
in
boulder,
and
it
is
not
just
in
boulder.
it
is
going
on,
and
it
is
time
we
do
something
about
that
to
say
that
kind
of
experimentation
is
too
much
and
too
far.
what
we
need
is
a
clear
statement
from
this
court
saying
that,
you
know,
it
is
one
thing
to
experiment
in
a
way
to
improve
or
increase
the
thing,
but
it
is
another
thing
to
set
aside
national
policies,
it
is
another
thing
to
get
to
a
position
where
you
can
and
will,
and
demonstrably
so,
are
abusing
the
process.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
think
it
ought
to
take
a
look
and
see
if
there
is
an
abuse
out
there,
and
if
there
is
an
abuse,
it
ought
to
cure
the
abuse.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
right,
what
is
missing--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--a
legislator
saying,
set
forth
some
kind
of
regulation.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
no,
i
don't
think
so.
no.
then
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no,
sir,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no.
no,
no.
the
answer
is
not
there.
if
the
state
legislature
were
to
enact
a
law
that
said
there
could
only
be
one
newspaper
in
the
state,
or
one
cable
television
in
the
state,
i
think
they
would
not
have
any
immunity--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--would
be
invalid.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
under
the
first
amendment,
and
i
believe
under
the
antitrust
also.
i
cannot
believe--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--well,
you
know,
you
can
read
those
cases
a
lot
of
ways,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
extraordinary,
the
thing
that
a
state
could
secure
immunity
from
a
federal
national
policy,
a
congressional
statute,
by
violating
the
constitution.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
oh,
yes,
sir,
i
think...
we
are
dealing
with
ordinary
commercial
activity.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
it
couldn't
work
here.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
sir,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
separate
the
two.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
moment
for
rebuttal
if
i
may,
so
if
i
can
resign
and
sit
down
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
will
not
be
able
to
cover
everything
i
obviously
want
to
say
here.
i
would
start
off
by
saying,
i
commend
to
you
the
dissent
by
justice
markey.
i
think
that
dissent
was
one
of
the
more
extraordinary
documents
i
have
had
occasion
to
read
as
a
lawyer,
and
of
course
i
loved
it,
but
it,
i
believe,
answered
almost
every
point
raised
by
counsel,
opposing
counsel
today.
let
me
quickly
just
indicate
to
you
this
whole
business
of
sovereignty,
who
is
the
sovereign,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
colorado
has
itself
in
city
of
denver
versus
sweet,
which
is
quoted
in
ours,
settled
the
fact
that
cities
are
not
sovereigns.
they
are
not
city
states.
i
think
the
law
is
closed.
on
the
question
of
regulation,
now,
we
are
dealing
with
regulation.
we
find
here
that
when
it
is
appropriate
to
talk
in
terms
of
proposed
5
percent,
we
move
from
the
90-day
moratorium
to
the
total
prohibition,
which
came
along
later
on,
it
says,
until
1984,
which
happened
to
be
the
date
on
which
they
believe
that
they
are
going
to
be
running
this
petitioner
completely
out
of
town,
will
only
charge
2
percent.
so
that
it
is
sophistry
to
talk
in
terms
of
a
90-day
moratorium.
the
90-day
moratorium
by
the
very
words
of
the
city
attorney
himself
was
a
contractual
ploy.
we
will
cancel
their
existing
permit,
we
will
enact
a
new
permit
with
a
geographical
limitation,
they
will
accept
it
by
performance,
by
continuing
to
serve,
and
we
will
have
them
by
contract.
if
they
don't,
they
can't
operate
at
all.
so
that
wasn't
regulation.
the
only
regulation,
if
you
want
to
call
it
regulation,
is
the
pure
prohibition,
which
came
about
in
july.
they
said,
no
time,
no
place,
no
manner,
no
how.
if
you
could
do
that
to
a
newspaper,
then
maybe
you
can
do
it
to
cable.
it
is
just
exactly
the
same
thing.
they
are
saying
to
you
that
you
can't
deliver
your
papers
on
the
other
side
of
town.
i
believe
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
dealing
with.
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--thank
you,
your
honor.
