unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
an
antitrust
pre
emption,
or
are
you
arguing
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
city
of
boulder
had
franchised
two
streetcar
companies
in
the
old
days
to
one
handle
the
north
side
of
town
and
the
other
handle
the
south
side
of
the
town,
and
in
each
of
those
streetcars
there
were
the
typical
advertising
things
that
you
find
in
streetcars
or
buses?
would
you
feel
that
was
unconstitutional
under
either
the
antitrust
laws
or
under
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but
the
cable
television,
the
two
competing
cable
television
companies
certainly
don't
have
access
to
the
entire
town.
one
has
access
to
one
side
of
the
town,
the
other
has
access
to
the
other
side.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
ought
to
be?
unknown
speaker
how
different
is
that
from
zoning?
when
you
say
that
one
theater
shall
be
built
on
this
block,
and
we
just
don't
want
any
other
theaters
within
a
mile
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is
about
theaters.
unknown
speaker
and
it
may
well
be
in
the
number
of
square
miles
comprised
in
the
city
of
boulder
that
there
are
many
more
applicants
for
theater
licenses
than
there
are
permissible
sites.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
we
don't
ordinarily
take
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
or
disagreed
with
findings
of
the
district
court,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
again
asking
us
to
second
guess
the
reading
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
sits
in
that
circuit
and
in
that
state,
of
a
state
constitutional
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
were
just
quoting
the
colorado
constitution.
unknown
speaker
except
that,
i
am
sure
you
would
say,
and
others
would
agree,
that
a
city
or
a
state
can't
experiment
with
first
amendment
values.
doesn't
this
fall
somewhere
in
reach
of
what
justice
brandeis
said
about
letting
new
problems,
particularly,
be
dealt
with
in
the
laboratory
of
local
control?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
you
would
agree
that
this
whole
matter
of
cable
television
is
something
that
is
in
a
state
of
rather
swift--
unknown
speaker
--well,
tell
me,
mr.
farrow,
what
do
you
think
colorado
could
do
to
bring
itself
within
the...
to
bring
this
situation
within
the
parker
brown
exemption?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
what
is
missing
here?
a
legislative
statute
permitting
boulder
to
do
this?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
state
legislature--
unknown
speaker
--were
to
enact
a
statute
which
authorized
boulder
to
do
exactly
what
it
did.
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not--
unknown
speaker
--i
didn't
catch
your
answer.
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at.
you
would
say,
a
statute
authorizing
boulder
to
do
this,
passed
by
the
colorado
legislature--
unknown
speaker
--would
be
invalid
under
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
parker
exemption?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
that
is
your
first
amendment
argument.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
first
amendment
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
parker
and
brown
certainly
permitted
state
legislatures
to
get
themselves
out
of,
as
states,
the
restraints
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
your
answer
to
me
is,
that
couldn't
work
here--
unknown
speaker
--because
of
the
first
amendment
provision.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
this
is
independently
of
the
first
amendment
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
they
also
have
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
city
lobbyists
in
the
state
legislature
have
as
little
influence
as
possible?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
what
extent
do
the
states
have
a
right
to
come
to
this
court
and
say,
in
spite
of
the
provision
of
our
constitution
and
statutes
and
so
forth,
do
we
nonetheless
have
a
right
to
have
this
court
pronounce
a
rule
that
says
the
home
rule
provisions
of
our
constitutions
are
virtually
meaningless
because
of
some
overriding
federal
consideration?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
i
get
that,
mr.
mcmahon.
is
that
to
say
that
home
rule
states,
the
municipalities
are
to
be
treated
as
the
sovereign
for
the
purposes
of
the
federalism
issue
that
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
in
other
words,
the
state
as
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states,
only
the
states
are
sovereign.
unknown
speaker
what
the
states
individually
want
to
do
as
between
the
state
and
the
municipality
is
no
concern
of
the
federal
issue
that
is
involved.
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
the
states
lay
down
regulations
binding
upon
the
municipalities
in
this
area?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
states
had
"pre
empted"
this
area,
or
undertaken
to
do
so
by
legislative
action.
unknown
speaker
then
what
if
a
municipality
said,
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
there
is
too
much
television,
we
don't
want
any
more
television,
cable
or
otherwise.
they
couldn't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
only
addressing
the
power
question,
the
governmental
power
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
addressing.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
city
statute
conflicted
with
the
state
statute,
but
conformed
to
the
state
constitution?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
a
hypothetical
question.
what
if
it
conflicted
with
the
state
statute
but
comported
with
the
state
constitution
granting
unlimited
home
rule
to
certain--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
are
arguing
for
33
states,
you
say.
i
mean,
conceivably
in
one
of
them
it
might
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcmahon,
i
think
i
misheard
you.
the
state
would
bar
all
cable
television?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
the
city--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
that
is
what
i
was
asking.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
there
is
a
federal
law
on
that,
too.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
i
gather
your
position
is
that
colorado
does
not
have
presently,
in
any
event,
any
state
policy--
unknown
speaker
--to
displace
competition
in
cable
tv
with
a
regulation
or
monopoly
public
service.
unknown
speaker
and
to
have
it,
the
state
legislature
has
to
enact
it.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
constitutional
provision,
home
rule
provision
does
not--
unknown
speaker
--how
many
states
are
home
rule
states?
nineteen
or
so?
unknown
speaker
thirty-five.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
they
differ
in
degree,
though,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
how
long?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
howard,
isn't
it
clear
that
the
city
plans
to
have
an
exclusive
operator
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
exclusive
operator
in
particular
portions
of
the
city.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
it
would
be
lawful
for
the
city
to
grant
an
exclusive
contract?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about
federal
law
right
now.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
suppose
it
was
a
milk
business.
could
they
give
a
license
to
one
dairy
to
operate
in
the
city
in
exchange
for
5
percent
of
the
revenue,
say?
unknown
speaker
they
could
do
this
in
any
industry.
they
could
say,
we
are
going
to
have
a
monopoly
in
this
particular
business,
and
we
will
take
5
percent
of
the
profits
as
the
price
of
the
franchise?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
or
grant
one
city
the
inside
track.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
analogy
with
the
old
private
water
suppliers,
which
i
suppose
have
largely
disappeared.
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
across
the
board
regardless
of
the
industry
and
the
physical
scarcity
and
all
the
rest,
a
municipality
could
legitimately
require
a
monopoly
in
any
industry
in
its
city.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
position--
unknown
speaker
--with
respect
to
when
may
they
require
only...
when
are
they
permitted
to
have
monopoly
conditions
apply?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
special
interest
here?
unknown
speaker
is
it
that
the
poles
will
only
hold
one
set
of
cables?
unknown
speaker
i
still
didn't
hear
the
answer
to
my
question.
what
is
the
special
interest
of
the
city
here?
is
it
the
interest
in
controlling
the
streets?
unknown
speaker
are
they
interests
that
make
it
necessary
to
have
only
one
operator?
unknown
speaker
are
they
interests
which
make
it
appropriate
to
have
only
one
operator?
unknown
speaker
only
one
operator
in
any
portion
of
the
city
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
violations
of
law
going
on,
but
the
question
really
is,
is
whether
or
not
the
city
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
having
only
one
operator,
and
requiring,
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
law,
excluding
all
but
one
from
the
market.
unknown
speaker
mr.
howard,
you
have
used
the
word,
or
the
term
"city
interest".
are
you
analogizing
cable
tv
to
the
sort
of
traditional
type
of
businesses
affected
with
the
public
interest,
like
providing
gas,
electricity,
water,
and
transportation?
unknown
speaker
may
you
assert
the
parker
brown
exception
without
state
legislative--
unknown
speaker
--you
do.
that
is
your
principal
argument,
i
gather,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
the
home
rule
aspects
under
the
colorado
constitution
are
sufficient
to
qualify
the
municipality
for
the
parker
brown
exception?
unknown
speaker
from
the
state
legislature.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
that
opinion
rather
explicit?
unknown
speaker
in
that
it
required
authorization
from
the
state
legislature--
unknown
speaker
--which
we
do
not
have
here.
what
we
have
here,
if
there
is
authorization,
is
in
the
state
constitutional
home
rule
provision.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
we
have
to
make
up
our
minds
here
whether
sovereign
for
the
purposes
of
the
parker
brown
exception
includes
a
home
rule
city?
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
to
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
may
be
the
relationships
between
the
states
and
municipalities,
there
is
still
a
question
whether
for
purposes
of
the
parker
brown
rule
a
municipality
can
ever
be
sovereign,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
to
decide
it
here?
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
to
decide
it
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
saying
the
home
rule
factor
is
what
is
the
fulcrum
here.
unknown
speaker
but
this
argument,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
as
to
the
ability
of
a
home
rule
city
to
require
an
exemption
just
because
it
is
a
home
rule
city,
is
not
confined
to
the
cable
tv
industry.
it
would
apply
to
every
industry,
wouldn't
it?
it
would
apply
to
dairies,
and
they
could
say,
for
example,
in
boulder,
we
will
fix
the
prices
of
all
the
products
sold
in
this
city
at
such
and
such
a
price,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
the
condition
and
sale
of
public
utility
service
on
purchasing
lamps,
as
they
did
in
the
cantor
case,
we
can
do
that
in
this
city.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
the
sale
of
milk
then,
or
the
sale
of
bread,
the
sale
of
foodstuffs
in
the
city.
i
suppose
they
would
be
exempt
there,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
the
sale
of
milk
cartons.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
milk,
and
milk
cartons,
and
price
of
food,
and
all
that
would
be
subject
to
the
parker
brown
exemption
in
the
home
rule
states
just
on
the
basis
of
the
city's
own
action.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
view,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
those
examples
i
gave
you
would
be,
would
they
not,
examples
of
legitimate
local
concern--
unknown
speaker
--disposal
of
milk
cartons,
and
the
garbage,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
but
the
reasons
we
have
a
legitimate
local
concern
in
cable
tv
is
the
interest
of
the
city
in
two
way
communication,
and
in
diversity
of
programming,
and,
i
suppose,
in
the
revenues
in
the
franchise
fee,
and
in
the
use
of
the
streets
with
the
cables.
those
are
the
reasons.
unknown
speaker
who
makes
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is,
one,
a
governmental
interest,
and
the
type
of
governmental
interest
that
is
covered
by
the
home
rule
provision
of
the
constitution?
who
is
to
make
that
determination?
unknown
speaker
and
now
we
have
to
decide.
unknown
speaker
but
that
we
will
have
to
decide
for
boulder
and
podunk
and
jumpoff
and
all
of
the
different
home
rule
towns
in
this
country.
unknown
speaker
and
they
will
be
different,
won't
they?
unknown
speaker
always?
unknown
speaker
you
jumped
from
20
years
to
always.
that
is
a
big
jump.
unknown
speaker
i
assume,
counsel,
that
a
city
could
pretty
well
control
the
location
of
parking
lots
by
zoning,
by
its
zoning
authority.
could
a
city
with
the
proper
declarations
of
the
matters
of
traffic
congestion,
traffic
safety,
and
the
need
for
uniform
standards,
take
over
control
of
all
the
parking
lots
in
the
city?
and
if
you
know,
have
any
cities
done
that?
unknown
speaker
when
the
city
puts
up
a
lot
of
these
meters
along
the
streets,
are
they
engaging
in
a
governmental
or
a
proprietary
function?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
much
different
if
they
they
do
that
on
a
collective
basis?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
would
prevent
the
state
from
taking
that
function
over
from
the
cities,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
they
would
be
subject
to
treble
damages
every
time
they
turned
down
a
zoning
application.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
quite
a
difference
with
the
mini-theaters
case,
because
there
the
city
of
detroit
had
no
financial
interest
whatsoever
in
the
operation
of
the
theaters.
it
was
purely
a
regulatory
situation.
but
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
city
gets
a
percentage
of
the
revenues
or
something,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
that
difference.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
gives
the
city
an
interest
in
the
business,
though.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
state's
interest
there
was
in
curtailing
the
sale
of
raisins.
unknown
speaker
curtailing
the
sale.
right.
unknown
speaker
will
you
refresh
my
recollection?
does
the
city
contemplate
regulating
the
rates
of
cable
television
licensed
by
it?
unknown
speaker
in
most
of
the
businesses
deemed
to
be
affected
with
the
public
interest,
rates
are
regulated.
unknown
speaker
if
the
city
has
a
percentage
of
the
gross,
the
city's
interest
may
be
adverse
to
the
public's.
the
higher
the
rates,
the
more
revenue
the
city
derives.
i
don't
know
whether
this
system
is
working
or
not.
can
you
hear
me?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
adverse,
though,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
new
proposal
to
increase
that
fee
to
5
percent?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
saw
something
about
a
5
percent
fee
in
the
record.
