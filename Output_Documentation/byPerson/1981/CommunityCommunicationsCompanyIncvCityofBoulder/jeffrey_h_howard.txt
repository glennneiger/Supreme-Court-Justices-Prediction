mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
begin
by
analyzing
what
the
city
of
boulder
did
here.
the
city
of
boulder
has
one
cable
tv
operator
who
has
operated
in
town
for
about
16
years.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
about
16
years.
the
city
wished
to
go
out
into
the
market
and
solicit
other
operators
to
come
in
and
file
bids.
it
ultimately
did
that,
mailed
out
50
requests
for
bids
and
published
an
ad
in
the
wall
street
journal.
to
facilitate
that
process,
and
feeling,
based
on
the
record
before
it,
that
the
continued
wiring
of
town
by
the
existing
operator
would
preclude
any
chance
of
people
coming
in
from
the
outside,
the
city
did
one
thing,
and
that
is
the
thing
before
the
court.
it
adopted
a
90-day
suspension
of
construction
for
new
cable
by
that
operator.
that
is
the
only
action.
there
is
no
monopolization
of
the
business.
there
is
no
taking
over
of
the
service
of
cable
tv.
there
is
none
of
that
kind--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
the
city
has
taken
final
action
in
this
matter,
and
has
taken
the
advice--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--has
taken
the
advice
of
the
state
attorney
general's
office
and
divided
the
city
into
districts,
and
proposes
to
issue
cable
permits
for
each
district.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
under
state
law
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--i
think
under
federal
law
that
would
be
lawful.
it
would
not
be
subject
to
sherman
act
attack.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
well,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
standards
that
this
court
has
enunciated
in
the
prior
decisions,
particularly
the
city
of
lafayette
case,
i
think
the
city
would
pass
the
test,
even--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--of
course,
we
believe
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
because
all
the
city
of
boulder
has
done
here
is
adopt
a
90-day
suspension
on
further
construction.
the
final
act,
to
be
sure,
was
a
districting
of
the
city
and
a
granting
of
franchises
in
particular
areas,
but
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
cities
have
since
they
were
created
granted
that
kind
of
an
exclusive
franchise
to
have
a
railroad
car
or
a
city
railway
on
the
north
side
of
town
and
another
one
on
the
south
side
of
town.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
grant
one
operator
the
inside
loop
and
another
the
outside
loop,
or
even
grant
one
operator
the
whole
town.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
they
have
largely
disappeared,
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
very
close
analogy
there,
particularly
in
the
west,
where
boulder
is,
because
long
ago,
private
water
service
was
done
commercially
by
private
water
purveyors.
part
of
the
home
rule
process
in
colorado
at
the
turn
of
the
century
immediately
affected
water
service.
the
city
of
denver
as
one
of
its
first
acts
as
a
home
rule
city
took
over
the
provision
of
water
service
on
a
monopoly
basis
in
that
city,
and
still
provides
water
service
by
the
city
today.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
don't
think
that
is
our
position.
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
our
position--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--as
in
other
areas
of
local
governmental
action,
it
is
important
to
consider
whether
the
matter
at
issue
is
within
the
scope
of
legitimate
local
concern.
the
city
of
boulder
has
no
interest
in
making
rubic's
cubes,
a
popular
game
the
children
are
using
today,
and
selling
them
outside
the
city
limits,
nor
could
it
grant
an
exclusive
franchise
for
rubic's
cubes
manufacture,
but
if
the
city
has
a
special
interest
in
the
provision
of
water
service,
the
city
has
a
special
interest
in
the
maintenance
of
its
right
of
way
for
transport,
communication,
and
other
traditional
things
that
have
taken
place
there,
then
the
equation
is
a
little
different.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
one
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--one
of
the
things
that
caused
cities
to
be
formed,
both
in
the
east
and
in
the
west,
was
the
administration
of
the
public
right
of
way.
perhaps
one
of
the
first
things
was
to
have
a
public
water
service.
naturally,
those
pipes
went
in
that
public
right
of
way.
perhaps
the
next
thing
was
a
street
for
transport,
and
a
street
railway,
and
then
there
were
telegraph
lines,
and
communication
cables.
what
we
have
today
is
another
cable.
it
is
a
different
technology,
a
new
kind
of
device
the
scientists
have
come
up
with,
but
the
principle
is
no
different.
when
the
people
of
colorado
amended
their
constitution
in
1902
to
put
that--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--the
city
has
several
interests,
as
were
revealed
in
the
final
districting
ordinance
that
was
adopted.
one,
of
course,
is
the
control
of
the
streets
and
the
public
right
of
way.
another
is
to
assure
diversity
of
cable
service
around
the
community.
the
existing
operator
has
consistently
refused
to
provide
two
way
communication
service,
consistently
refused
to
provide
burglar
alarms
and
fire
alarms
hooked
up
to
the
city
police
department,
and
so
forth.
one
of
the
things
the
city
went
out
into
the
market
to
see
if
it
could
get
were
people
who
would
provide
that
kind
of
service.
the
city
has
a
legitimate
local
interest
in
those
things.
in
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
second
boulder
case,
the
court
addressed
the
legitimate
interests
of
that
nature.
those
are
unique
to
cable,
i
believe,
don't
apply
to
water
service,
stronger
interests.
they
may
also
involve
the
competing
interests
of
boulder
citizens
and
first
amendment
hearing.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
well,
we
would
submit
that
is
not
the
situation
here,
but
the
situation
here
is
this.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
there
has
only
been
one
operator
in
any
city
in
the
united
states,
out
of
6,000
cable
systems,
the
record
here
shows.
across
the
country.
no
more
than
six
have
more
than
one
operator.
this
petitioner
itself
operates
130
systems
or
more
across
the
country,
and
all
of
those
are
one
operator.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
well,
in
this
case,
we
would
say
that
the
justifications
for
the
districting
ordinance
may
well
be
broader
and
different
than
the
justifications
for
a
90-day
suspension
of
construction.
those
justifications
have
already
been
litigated
in
the
second
boulder
case,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed
the
trial
court's
issuance
of
an
injunction.
that
case
involves
more
fully
the
question
of
when
can
a
city
district
itself
and
issue,
in
effect,
single
operator
permits
for
each
particular
district.
it
is
not
an
unusual
process.
the
city
of
los
angeles,
the
city
of
new
york,
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
others
have
all
done
that
kind
of
thing.
cities
use
that
technique
for
a
variety
of
local
purposes.
they
use
it
to
try
to
assure
coverage
of
the
entire
city
or
uniform
service.
if
free
market
forces
were
allowed
to
prevail,
you
might
well
have
and
have
had
in
some
cities
a
situation
called
cream
skimming,
when
the
cable
service
only
hooks
up
to
the
rich
side
of
town
and
doesn't
hook
up
to
the
other
side
of
the
tracks.
districting
gives
the
cities
a
better
opportunity
to
police
that
kind
of
activity
and
prevent
it,
if
that
is
what
they
believe
is
in
the
public
interest.
but
also...
excuse
me.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
is
no
contest
over
that
point
in
this
case,
because
in
the
manor
vail
case
in
the
colorado
supreme
court,
a
subsidiary
of
this
petitioner
was
involved,
and
in
their
answer
in
that
case,
this
petitioner
conceded
that
cable
television
was
a
private
business
affected
with
the
public
interest,
and
in
that
case
they
supported
the
home
rule
authority
of
a
colorado
city
to
fix
the
rates
for
cable
television.
the
fact
is
that
cities
have
been
forced
to
address
problems
with
cable
television
in
a
variety
of
fronts.
absent
price
competition,
cities
have
been
faced
with
the
question
of
how
do
we
keep
the
prices
that
don't
have
any
price
competition
in
line?
absent
service
competition,
when
there
is
only
one
provider,
how
do
they
provide
high
quality
service
that
the
market
would
otherwise
provide?
that
is
the
kind
of
background
that
is
at
issue
here.
more
particularly,
there
is
a
traditional
line
of
regulating
cable
tv
in
this
manner
in
colorado,
a
long
prior
history
of
such
regulation
both
from
the
federal
government
and
local
governments.
the
federal
communications
commission
has
since
1972
encouraged
local
authorities
to
bring
their
special
expertise,
as
the
commission
called
it,
to
these
problems,
and
has
recognized
that
local
cable
tv
regulation,
including
the
franchise
terms,
the
rates,
districting,
which
is
the
issue
in
boulder
two,
and
similar
cable
matters
are
"uniquely
within
the
competence
of
local
authorities.
"
that
is
at
page
18
of
our
brief,
where
we
quote
from
the
fcc.
in
terms
of
traditional
city
functions,
cable
strung
in
the
right
of
way
is
just
the
latest
development
in
the
use
of
the
right
of
way.
we
submit
that
when
the
people
of
colorado
in
1902
amended
their
constitution
to
give
this
local
autonomy,
they
did
not
contemplate
that
the
constitution
would
have
to
be
amended
for
each
new
technological
development.
they
gave
the
local
autonomy
over
that
right
of
way
to
the
local
city
government,
run
by
nine
elected
council
members.
colorado
cities
have
always
recognized
that
power
and
exercised
it.
the
amicus
brief
of
the
colorado
municipal
league
here
points
out
that
about
85
cities
in
colorado
have
now
regulated
cable
tv.
this
pattern
dates
back
to
the
early
sixties.
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
recognized
the
validity
of
this
kind
of
regulation
by
home
rule
cities
in
the
manor
vail
case,
and
the
tenth
circuit
has
now
so
held
twice
in
this
case,
boulder
one
and
boulder
two.
in
colorado,
however,
as
in
the
vast
majority
of
states,
the
state
legislatures
have
chosen
not
to
adopt
legislation
on
cable.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
that
is
our
principal
argument.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
well,
we
basically
have
two
arguments
about
that,
your
honor.
one
is
that
we
meet
the
test
even
of
the
plurality
in
city
of
lafayette,
because
although
the
court
indicated
that
authorization
or
direction
was
required--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--from
the
state--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
state
legislature
is
merely
the
creation
of
the
people
of
colorado.
they
must
look
to
the
constitution,
too,
for
the
scope
of
their
authority.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
think
what
the
court
has
to
recognize
is
whether
the
state--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--i
think
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
the
state
has
recognized
the
power
of
these
municipalities
in
such
a
way
that
it
passes
those
tests.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
don't
think
the
court
addressed
that
in
any
prior
case,
other
than
to
say
that
authorization
or
direction--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to,
and
i
submit
our
second
argument
for
why
we
meet
the
test.
we
think
the
kind
of
tracing
back
to
a
legislative
mandate
that
the
pluralities
seem
to
contemplate
in
city
of
lafayette
is
unnecessary
where
the
challenged
municipal
act
is
a
governmental
regulatory
enactment,
a
90-day
moratorium,
and
applies
solely
within
the
city's
political
jurisdiction,
rather
than
the
operation
of
a
business
enterprise
outside
the
city's
political
authority
and
political
jurisdiction,
and
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
much
different
from
the
private
venture
of
the
city
outside
its
boundaries
in
lafayette,
that
kind
of
tracking
back
for
particular
authority
is
unnecessary.
it
is
our
position
that
in
that
case
it
is
sufficient
that
the
city's
act
is
authorized,
and
the
distinction
as
a
matter
of
state
law
whether
it
is
authorized
by
a
statute,
which
can
be
changed
by
the
legislature
at
its
whim,
or
by
the
people
in
the
constitution
is
irrelevant.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
yes,
your
honor,
the
home
rule
factor
is
the
fulcrum
here
that
was
missing
in
lafayette,
and
a
factor
that
makes
the
question
broader
than
whether
we
pass
the
test.
it
makes
the
question
one
more
of
democracy
at
work
at
the
local
level,
if
you
will,
because
if
the
rule
were
changed,
if
a
home
rule
city
could
not
act
within
the
scope
of
parker
immunity,
absent
going
back
to
the
legislature
for
each
particular
act
and
a
new
technology
each
time,
to
get
a
new
authorization,
in
effect
the
court
under
the
antitrust
laws
will
be
holding
that
there
can
be
no
home
rule,
because
cities
cannot
afford
in
this
day
and
time
to
allow
the
continued
exposure
to
potential
treble
damages
in
all
of
these
areas
in
which
they
act
that
may
have
an
anticompetitive
aspect
to
them
to
keep
on
ringing
up.
they
are
going
to
have
to
find
that
safe
harbor,
and
to
do
so
would
mean
abandoning
their
whole
tradition
of
home
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
well,
i
think
the
question
again,
to
answer--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--no,
you
can't,
your
honor.
i
think
the
basic
question
would
still
remain
the
same.
cities
can
only
act
in
areas
where
they
have
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
they
may
well
have
no
legitimate
interest
in
the
sale
of
lamps,
but
they
certainly
have
a
strong
interest
in
some
kinds
of
local
activities.
cable
is
one
of
them,
and
zoning
is
the
other.
the
court
and
my
worthy
opponent
now
have
recognized--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--the
last
term,
in
the
minnesota
cloverleaf
creamery
case,
the
court
dealt
with
a
question
involving
non
returnable
milk
bottles.
there
it
was
the
state,
to
be
sure,
not
a
city.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
but
there
was
a
principle
there
involving
milk
cartons
that
is
relevant
here,
we
submit.
mr.
justice
brennan,
writing
for
the
court,
in
footnote
6,
pointed
out,
and
i
quote,
"the
states
are
free
to
allocate
lawmaking
function
to
whatever
branch
of
state
government
they
may
choose.
"
and
i
think
the
dissent
agreed
with
that
notion.
what
we've
got
here,
so
long
as
the
matter
is
a
legitimate
governmental
concern,
and
i
am
presuming
that...
not
everything
in
the
world
is.
so
long
as
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--not
necessarily.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is,
it
would
have
to
be
a
matter
of
legitimate
local
concern.
milk
cartons
may
not
be.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
am
not
certain--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--i
am
not
certain
whether
milk
cartons
would.
it
may
well
be
a
statewide
concern,
because
of
the
transport
of
trash,
and
bringing
in
of
the
materials
from
outside
the
city.
it
may
not
be
a
legitimate
local
concern.
i
think
we
have
to
take
those
case
by
case.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
those
are
among
the
reasons.
there
are
more,
if
i
may.
cable
television
only
arises
within
a
particular
city.
this
cable
system
doesn't
apply
to
anyone
outside
of
boulder.
it
only
affects
boulder
citizens.
it
only
uses
the
boulder
right
of
way.
it
only
collects
money
from
boulder
citizens,
and
all
of
the
hardware
for
the
system
is
in
the
city
of
boulder,
and
everyone
who
is
hooked
up
is
in
the
city
of
boulder.
so,
in
terms
of
distinguishing
boulder
from
the
rest
of
the
political
jurisdictions,
it
affects
boulder's
interests
much
more
than
it
affects
an
adjacent
county
or
town
with
whom
this
system
has
no
interaction.
in
that
context,
i
would
agree
with
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
question
of
state
law
to
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
the
state
courts.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
in
the
manor
vail
case
at
least
implicitly
recognized
the
home
rule
power
of
cities
in
colorado
to
regulate
the
rates
of
cable
television,
and
also
by
the
tenth
circuit
court,
which
in
this
case
has
now
twice
held
that
cable
television,
at
least
the
incidence
within
the
city's
limits--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--well,
we
would
submit
that
some
deference
is
due
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
to
the
circuit
court
in
those
decisions,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--your
honor,
i
think
the
decision
before
the
court
is
not
whether
to
permit
it,
but
whether
to
stop
what
has
happened
now
for
20
years,
since
this
new
technology
began,
because
the
history
shows
and
the
record
shows
that
cable
regulation
has
worked,
by
and
large,
at
the
local
level,
and
it
continues
to
work.
it
has
always
been
done
by
cities
and
towns.
it
is
being
done
by
los
angeles
and
new
york
and
every
city
in
the
country.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
since
the
first
inception
of
this--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--well,
in
the
life
of
the
technology,
it
may
be
a
long...
a
big
jump,
because
the
technology
may
only
have
a
short
life
span,
and
it
may
be
replaced
by
the
next
new
technology
that
comes
down
the
pike,
so
always
may
be
forever
for
cable
tv
if
it
is
replaced
next
year
by
some
new
technology.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
think
cities
have
regulated
parking
lots
as
part
of
their
land
use
planning,
their
zoning.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cities
that
have
taken
over
it,
but
taking
over
the
parking
lot
would
be...
perhaps
be
interpreted
as
a
proprietary
kind
of
activity,
if
there
were
city
attendants
instead
of
the
private
attendants
charging
money
to
park
in
the
lot.
that
is
not
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
we
submit.
the
city
is
not
trying
to
run
the
cable
business.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
we
would
say
that
they
are
engaging
in
a
governmental
function,
and
we
would
say
that--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--the
reason
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
is
that
whether
it
is
governmental
can't
be
decided
simply
because
it
was
once
done
in
a
proprietary...
by
private
operators,
or
that
the
city
gets
money
from
it.
there
may
well
be
certain
integral
functions
of
the
city,
administering
traffic
in
the
city
and
things
like
that,
that
even
though
they
have
a
commercial
tone
to
them
qualify
as
an
integral
governmental
function,
and
the
parking
meters
may
well
be
one
of
those
things.
water
service,
we
would
submit,
surely
is.
it
was
once
done
commercially,
with
a
private
vendor
of
water,
taken
over
by
the
city,
and
is
now
being
done
by
cities
for
about
80
years
in
this
country,
at
least
in
the
west.
that,
we
would
submit,
surely
constitutes
an
integral
local
governmental
function.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
federal
constitution.
there
may
be
something
in
the
state
constitution,
and
in
colorado,
if
a
matter
has
been
determined
to
be
purely
local,
certain
incidents
of
cable
tv
may
be,
for
all
we
know,
then
the
state
legislature
is
without
power
to
act.
a
perfect
example
is
zoning
in
colorado.
home
rule
cities
are
able
to
zone
not
by
virtue
of
some
state
legislative
mandate.
there
is
no
legislative
mandate
for
zoning.
the
power
for
home
rule
cities
to
zone
comes
entirely
from
their
status
as
home
rule
cities.
and
the
problem,
we
would
submit,
if
the
court
were
to
reverse
in
this
case,
is
exemplified
by
zoning,
long
a
traditionally
recognized
local
function,
because
in
colorado
and
other
home
rule
places,
the
cities
acts
could
turn
to
no
specific
mandate
from
the
state
legislature,
and
in
effect
their
zoning
would
then
be
subject
to
attack
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
exactly,
your
honor,
and
there
are
many
kinds
of
zoning
activities
that
may
restrain
trade.
the
court
has
dealt
with
some
in
city
of
tiberon
and
american
mini-theaters
recently,
different
attacks
on
those
zoning
ordinances
there,
but
we
would
submit,
if
colorado
home
rule
cities
can't
find
parker
immunity,
then
the
same
attacks
that
were
made
in
city
of
tiberon
and
in
american
mini-theaters
now
will
lie
against
home
rule
cities
in
colorado,
merely
by
being
reformulated
under
an
antitrust
theory.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
we
submit
that
that--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
let
me
tell
the
court
exactly
what
the
facts
are.
the
facts
are,
the
city
gets
2
percent
of
gross
as
its
franchise
fee.
we
would
submit
that
does
not
change
the
legal
character
of
the
act.
in
parker
versus
brown--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--in
parker
versus
brown,
the
state
got
$2.50
per
ton
of
raisins,
in
the
state
of
california.
it
gave
the
state
the
same
kind
of
an
interest.
the
more
raisins
that
were
sold,
the
more
fee
the
state
of
california
got,
and
the
court
had
no
trouble--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--well,
the
state's
interest
there
was
in
keeping
the
price
high,
as
the
opinion--
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
--indicates.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
those
matters
have
not
been
decided
by
the
city
at
this
time,
your
honor,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate.
the
city
has
thought
of
all
kinds
of
activities
that
might
be
important
to
be
addressed,
and
rates
were
one
of
them,
in
a
model
ordinance
they
floated
as
a
proposal
long
ago.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
pattern
across
the
country
in
cable
television
seems
to
be
increasingly
to
consider
rate
regulation
where
there
is
no
price
competition.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
i
can
hear
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
well,
there
could
be
multiple
situations
where
a
city's
interests
can
be
either
directed
in
one
direction
or
the
other.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
it
could
be
adverse
in
that
case.
i
think
in
this
case,
with
a
90-day
moratorium,
the
city's
stake
in
the
enterprise
through
a
2
percent
fee,
which
is
very
small,
would
cut
the
other
way.
it
would
be
in
the
city's
interest
to
have
these
people
stringing
cables
everywhere,
so
that
they
could
get
a
greater
return.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
h.
howard
there
was
a
5
percent
proposal
in
the
model
ordinance,
but
the
ordinance
that
has
been
adopted
in
this
case,
including
districting,
specifically
says...
we
reprinted
that
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
because
it
was
left
out
of
the
joint
appendix...
specifically
says
that
these
people
will
have
no
increase
in
their
fee
whatsoever.
the
impacts
beyond
zoning
go
into
a
variety
of
other
areas.
in
our
brief
we
discuss
low
cost
housing,
waste
regulation,
as
local
and
traditional
governmental
functions
which
in
colorado
are
only
based
upon
home
rule
constitutional
power,
not
based
on
a
statutory
authorization.
these
kinds
of
things,
we
submit,
all
demonstrate
legitimate
local
concerns
which
have
traditionally
been
performed
at
the
local
level,
and
which
may
well
have
anticompetitive
aspects
to
them.
the
significance
from
our
standpoint,
we
would
submit,
is
that
if
the
petitioner
here
were
to
get
its
way,
colorado
home
rule
cities
would
be
unable
to
act
because
the
liability
for
potential
treble
damages
would
force
them
to
go
back
to
the
legislature
each
time
and
in
effect
do
away
with
the
whole
home
rule
principle
of
government.
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
article
20
of
the
constitution
gives
home
rule
cities,
and
i
quote,
"every
power
theretofore
possessed
by
the
legislature.
"
thus,
by
virtue
of
article
20,
a
home
rule
city
is
not
inferior
to
the
general
assembly
concerning
its
local
and
municipal
affairs.
we
submit
the
court
should
respect
that
allocation
of
power,
and
that
to
do
otherwise
would
have
disastrous
consequences.
first,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
tear
asunder
the
traditional
pattern
of
home
rule,
because
municipal
governments
couldn't
afford
to
let
the
clock
of
treble
damages
keep
on
accruing.
they
would
have
to
go
back
and
give
up
their
home
rule
power.
but
far
more
important
than
that
in
the
long
term,
and
even
more
troubling
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
if
home
rule
cities
can
only
avoid
antitrust
litigation
and
achieve
immunity
by
going
back
to
the
state
legislature
each
time
for
renewed
authority,
then
for
practical
purposes
there
cannot
be
any
home
rule.
this
result,
we
submit,
is
a
result
the
court
should
consider
carefully
and
should
avoid.
this
is
a
result,
we
submit,
that
congress
never
intended
the
antitrust
laws
to
bring
about,
whatever
their
application
to
ordinary
commercial
ventures
by
cities
outside
their
boundaries.
and
this
is
a
result
which
we
submit
the
principles
of
our
system,
which
the
court
has
addressed
in
the
national
league
of
cities
case,
and
the
deference
traditionally
owed
to
the
state
constitutional
choice
by
the
people
in
allocating
their
legislative
power
does
not
allow.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
