no.
80-1350,
community
communications
versus
the
city
of
boulder,
colorado.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
back
in
1943,
the
court
decided
a
case
styled
parker
versus
brown
which
held
that
a
federal
--
that
the
federal
antitrust
laws
did
not
prohibit
a
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
sovereign
powers
from
imposing
certain
anticompetitive
restraints.
respondent,
city
of
boulder,
colorado
is
organized
as
a
so-called
home
rule
city
under
the
colorado
constitution.
that
constitution
grants
boulder
extensive
powers
of
self-government
in
local
and
municipal
matters,
indeed
every
power
theretofore
possessed
by
the
state
legislature
in
local
and
municipal
affairs.
and
pursuant
to
those
powers,
boulder
enacted
an
ordinance
purporting
to
regulate
the
cable
television
business.
the
ordinance
has
been
challenged
as
violative
of
the
sherman
antitrust
laws.
the
question
presented
is
whether
boulder,
as
a
home
rule
city,
enjoys
the
state
action
exemption
from
sherman
act
liability
announced
in
parker
v.
brown.
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
colorado
held
that
it
did
not.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
after
noting
that
the
city's
regulation
of
the
cable
television
business
was
the
only
control
or
act
of
supervision
exercised
by
a
state
local
government,
and
thus
represented
the
only
expression
of
policy
on
the
subject
matter,
reversed
the
district
the
court
and
held
that
the
city's
regulation
satisfied
the
criteria
for
the
parker
and
brown
exemption.
well,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
parker
v.
brown
exemption
reflects
the
federalism
principle
that
we
are
a
nation
of
states,
a
principle
that
makes
no
accommodation
or
sovereign
subdivisions
of
states.
as
this
court
said
almost
a
century
ago
in
the
case
called
united
states
v.
kagama,
all
sovereign
authority
within
the
geographical
limits
of
the
united
states
resides
either
with
and
i
quote
from
that
opinion,
"the
government
of
the
united
states
or
with
the
states
of
the
union.
there
exist
within
the
broad
domain
of
sovereignty
but
these
two.
there
may
be
cities,
counties,
and
other
organized
bodies
with
limited
legislative
functions,
but
they
are
all
derived
from,
or
exist
in,
subordination
to
one
or
the
other
of
these."
thus,
the
challenged
anticompetitive
regulation,
if
it
is
such
and
we
don't
decide
whether
it
is
or
not,
can
enjoy
the
parker
exemption
only
if
it
constitutes
the
action
of
the
state
of
colorado
itself
in
its
sovereign
capacity
and
it
does
not,
or
if
it
constitutes
municipal
action
in
furtherance
or
implementation
of
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
state
policy,
and
again,
it
does
not.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
therefore
be
and
it
is
reversed.
