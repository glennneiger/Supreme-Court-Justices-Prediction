mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
freedom
of
information
act
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
case
involves
exemption
6
of
the
act,
the
personal
privacy
exemption,
which
protects
against
mandatory
public
disclosure
of
government
documents
that
meet
two
criteria.
first,
the
document
must
satisfy
the
so-called
threshold
test
by
qualifying
as
a
personnel,
medical
or
similar
file.
and
second,
if
the
threshold
test
is
satisfied,
it
must
be
shown
that
disclosure
of
the
document
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
this
is
the
so-called
balancing
test
of
the
exemption.
the
question
presented
here
involves
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
phrase
6.
and
the
facts
may
be
briefly
stated.
in
september
1979
the
washington
post
submitted
an
foia
request
to
the
state
department
for
any
documents
indicating
whether
two
iranian
officials,
dr.
ali
behzadnia
and
dr.
ibrahim
yazdi,
were
american
citizens.
the
state
department
denied
the
request
on
the
basis
of
exemption
6.
after
the
washington
post
brought
suit
to
obtain
the
documents,
the
state
department
submitted
affidavits
from
an
assistant
secretary
of
state
saying
that
in
light
of
the
social
and
political
conditions
then
existing
in
iran,
which
were
briefly
described,
any
confirmation
or
denial
by
the
united
states
government
that
either
individual
is
a
united
states
citizen
would
be
likely
to
cause
a
substantial
threat
of
physical
harm
to
the
individual.
the
affidavits
also
listed
several
recent
examples
of
iranians
who
had
suffered
serious
harm
because
their
names
had
been
linked
to
the
united
states
in
official
documents.
despite
these
unrebutted
affidavits,
the
district
court
ordered
the
state
department
to
comply
with
the
post's
foia
request,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
the
government
had
failed
to
satisfy
the
threshold
requirement
of
exemption
6
by
showing
that
the
documents
requested
constituted
personnel,
medical
or
similar
files.
there's
no
question
that
this
was
not
a
personnel
or
medical
file.
the
court
said
that
to
qualify
as
a
similar
file
a
record
must
incorporate,
and
i
quote,
"intimate
details
about
an
individual,
information
of
the
same
magnitude
that
is
highly
personal
or
as
intimate
in
nature
as
that
at
stake
in
personnel
and
medical
records.
"
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
fact
of
current
united
states
citizenship
was
simply
not
an
intimate
detail.
as
a
result,
it
ordered
release
of
the
documents
without
reaching
the
balancing
part
of
the
exemption;
that
is,
without
considering
at
all
whether
in
light
of
the
state
department's
unrebutted
evidentiary
submission,
disclosure
of
the
documents
requested
by
the
washington
post
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
the
personal
privacy
of
the
individuals
named
in
the
documents.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
begin
discussion
of
this
case
by
stating
first
exactly
what
is
and
what
isn't
involved
here,
and
then
by
stating
exactly
what
the
opposing
arguments
of
counsel
are,
because
i
think
that
respondent's
briefs
have
attempted
to
obscure
the
relevant
issue.
as
i
just
said
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
question,
the
question
presented
here
is
not
whether
the
documents
requested
by
the
post
can
be
withheld
from
the
public.
even
if
this
court
eventually
agrees
with
the
government
as
to
the
correct
meaning
of
the
threshold
test
of
exemption
6,
there
would
still
have
to
be
a
remand.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
the
balancing
test.
we
believe
that
the
balancing
test
does
require
a
weighing
of
facts.
now,
the
facts
were
submitted
to
the
district
court
and
both
sides
moved
for
summary
judgment,
and
i
assume
that
this
court
could
reach
that
question.
it
wasn't
reached
by
the
court
below,
and
the
respondents
have
not
suggested
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
that
the
documents
must
be
disclosed
under
the
balancing
test.
neither
side
has
briefed
that
issue.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
weighs
the
public
interest
in
disclosure
of
the
documents
against
the
magnitude
of
the
harm,
the
magnitude
of
the
invasion
of
privacy
of
the
particular
individual
involved
or
named
in
the
documents.
and
that
is
often
a
fact
specific
inquiry.
as
i
say,
here
none
of
the
facts
were
disputed.
the
state
department's
affidavits
were
not
rebutted.
the
post
moved
for
summary
judgment,
as
did
the
government,
and
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
washington
post.
now,
the
issue
before
this
court
then
is
simply
whether
the
government
should
be
forced
to
release
these
documents
without
having
an
opportunity
to
show
the
court
of
appeals
that
disclosure
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
in
other
words,
the
question
here
is
what
sort
of
documents
in
government
files
that
relate
to
specific
individuals
did
congress
intend
to
make
eligible
for
undergoing
this
balancing
process.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
threshold
test
of
the
exemption
was
meant
only
to
screen
out
agency
records
that
don't
refer
to
any
specific
individual.
if
an
agency
document
either
explicitly
or
by
identifying
characteristics
does
refer
to
a
particular
person,
then
we
believe
that
what
congress
clearly
had
in
mind
in
enacting
exemption
6
was
that
release
of
the
document
would
be
governed
by
whether
public
disclosure
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
the
person's
privacy.
now,
considerations
such
as
the
intimacy
of
the
particular
facts
involved,
or
the
public
nature
of
the
information,
or
the
fact
that
the
information
sought
might
happen
to
be
located
in
court
records
somewhere
or
in
books
that
were
published
by
someone
are
not
irrelevant.
we
don't
say
that
those
are
irrelevant.
we
say
that
it
be
taken
into
account
in
the
balancing
part
of
exemption
6
rather
than
smuggled
into
the
similar
files
test.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
would
be
anomalous
perhaps
if
information
that
was
available
to
the
public
could
be
withheld
under
exemption
6,
but
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is
simply
can
we
make
a
specific
inquiry
into
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
under
the
balancing
test,
or
is
any
sort
of
inquiry
into
the
harm
to
the
individual
foreclosed
totally
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
very,
very
narrow
similar
files
test
that
is
imposed
on
federal
agencies.
the
washington
post,
on
the
other
hand,
embraces
the
d.c.
circuit's
view
that
a
court
is
precluded
from
engaging
in
any
balancing
unless
the
information
sought
not
only
refers
to
an
individual,
specific
individual,
but
also
is
generically
highly
intimate;
in
other
words,
unless
it's
the
kind
of
information
that
virtually
everyone
would
like
to
keep
private
about
himself.
now,
this
case
i
think
illustrates
the
differences
between
the
two
approaches
very,
very
well.
most
americans,
whether
they're
naturalized
citizens
or
were
born
here,
would
not
consider
citizenship
to
be
an
intimate
personal
fact.
they'd
freely
disclose
it.
it
is
not
an
intimate
detail.
but
for
current
residents
of
iran,
for
example,
possession
of
united
states
citizenship
might
well
be
taken
to
indicate
adherence
to
a
particular
political
philosophical
view
that's
out
of
favor
at
the
moment,
and
disclosure
of
american
citizenship--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--in
iran.
and
disclosure
of
american
citizenship
as
to
them
might
not
only
be
embarrassing
but
dangerous.
but
the
d.c.
circuit's
construction
of
similar
files
fails
to
take
that
at
all
into
account.
as
long
as
some
item
is
not
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
an
intimate
detail,
generically
intimate,
then
the
courts
and
the
agencies
are
precluded
from
engaging
in
any
balance.
now,
perhaps
this
difference
between
the
washington
post
view
of
the
threshold
test
and
the
government's
view
can
be
put
into
even
clearer
perspective
by
the
following
hypothetical.
let's
assume
that
some
foreign
leader
such
as
idi
amin
or
qadhafi
were
to
announce
that
he
was
going
to
kill
every
american
citizen
in
his
country.
and
let's
also
assume
that
that
leader,
quadhafi
or
idi
amin
or
the
washington
post,
would
then
make
an
foia
request
to
the
state
department
listing
500
people
who
live
in
that
country
and
asking
whether
they're
american
citizens.
now,
i
don't
think
any
of
us
would
have
any
trouble
concluding
that
under
those
circumstances
that's
not
the
sort
of
information
that
should
be
disclosed.
it
would
not
pass
the
balancing
test.
i
think
any
court
would
conclude
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy.
what
the
d.c.
circuit
says,
however,
is
that
because
american
citizenship
is
not
generically
intimate,
then
the
agency
is
foreclosed
from
engaging
in
the
balancing
process,
and
the
court
is
foreclosed
from
reviewing
the
agency's
determination
in
a
balancing
test.
the
evidence
has
to
be
disclosed.
now,
where
does
this
intimate
details
test
come
from?
it
certainly
doesn't
come
from
the
language
of
the
statute
which
doesn't
use
the
phrase
at
all.
the
threshold
test
of
exemption
6
talks
of
personnel,
medical
or
similar
files.
the
key
question
then
is
when
is
a
file
similar
to
a
personnel
file
or
a
medical
file.
and
certainly
the
common
denominator
is
not
that
the
file
only
contains
intimate
details
about
a
person.
there's
a
great
amount
of
information
in
government
personnel
or
medical
files
that
wouldn't
be
considered
generically
intimate
by
anyone:
the
color
of
one's
eyes,
one's
sex
or
height.
in
fact,
citizenship
information
is
almost
always
found
in
government
personnel
files.
yet
the
d.c.
circuit
has
told
us
in
this
case
that
citizenship
information
is
not
an
intimate
detail.
we
think
instead
that
what
all
personnel
and
medical
files
almost
by
definition
have
in
common
is
that
they
contain
facts
about
identifiable,
specific
individuals,
and
it's
that
characteristics
that
distinguishes
a
similar
file,
in
our
view,
and
allows
the
agency
and
the
courts
to
then
apply
the
balancing
test.
the
d.c.
circuit's
notion
of
intimate
details
as
the
determinant
of
a
similar
file
also
doesn't
come
from
the
legislative
history
of
exemption
6.
what
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
is
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
vast
amounts
of
information
about
individuals
that
were
stored
in
government
files
if
disclosure,
as
the
house
report
put
it,
would
harm
the
individual.
but
the
house
was
confronted
with
the
realization
that
it
would
be
impractical
to
try
to
identify
in
advance
every
type
of
government
file
or
every
type
of
document
that
should
not
be
disclosed.
so
what
the
solution
was
was
to
pick
a
broad
similar
files
threshold
test
so
that
no
item
that
refers
specifically
to
an
individual
would
be
excluded
from
the
exemption,
but
to
rely
on
the
balancing
test
to
screen
out
which
items
of
personal
information
should
be
withheld
and
which
items
shouldn't
be
withheld
from
the
public.
both
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
plainly
show
that
the
central
part
of
the
exemption,
the
crucial
part,
was
intended
to
be
the
balancing
test,
not
the
threshold
test.
and
this
court
reached
the
same
conclusion
in
the
rose
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
similar
files
leads
to
a
number
of
anomalous
results
that
congress
couldn't
have
intended.
for
example,
under
the
d.c.
circuit's
approach,
information
that
is
part
of
a
government
personnel
or
medical
file
could
be
considered
for
withholding
under
the
exemption
6
balancing
test
regardless
of
whether
it's
generically
intimate
because
it
meets
the
threshold
test
by
being
a
personnel
or
a
medical
file.
but
the
identical
information
if
it's
contained
in
a
government
file
other
than
a
personnel
or
a
medical
file,
it
say
be
sitting
right
beside
the
personnel
or
medical
file,
the
exact
same
information,
it
can't
be
considered
under
the
balancing
test
unless
it's
generically
intimate,
because
if
it's
not
generically
intimate,
it's
not
a
similar
file
under
their
view.
and
this
goes,
by
the
way,
even
if
it
could
be
shown
that
disclosure
of
the
information
would
work
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
and
let
me
give
the
court
an
example
of
what
i
mean.
let's
assume
that
one
of
the
individuals
involved
in
this
case,
yazdi
or
behzadnia,
had
once
applied
to
the
state
department
for
a
job.
if
he
had,
he
would
have
filled
out
a
personnel
form,
and
there
would
be
a
personnel
file
on
him,
and
he
surely
would
have
been
asked
on
the
form
whether
he
was
a
united
states
citizen,
and
somewhere
in
the
state
department's
personnel
files
would
be
the
answer
to
that
question.
now,
if
the
washington
post
had
submitted
the
request
they
submitted
in
this
case,
and
if
the
state
department
had
found
that
answer
in
its
personnel
file,
there's
no
question
that
it
would
have
satisfied
the
threshold
test
by
being
in
a
personnel
file,
and
the
question
would
then
be
does
it
pass
the
balancing
test.
and
a
court
in
considering
the
state
department's
views
on
that
issue
would
have
to
consider
the
unrebutted
affidavits
in
this
case.
but
because
the
information
sought
by
the
washington
post
in
this
case,
if
it
exists
in
the
state
department
at
all
exists
in
something
other
than
a
personnel
file,
the
d.c.
circuit
has
held
that
no
balancing
can
be
done,
no
inquiry
can
be
made
into
whether
it
would
work
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
now,
i'd
like
to
end
by
making
a
point
that
i
alluded
to
earlier,
but
i
think
it's
important
enough
to
repeat;
and
that
is
that
a
broad
reading
of
the
term
6
will
not
result
in
the
withholding
of
trivial
or
innocuous
low
privacy
information
in
government
files.
despite
the
impression
that
the
washington
post
and
the
newspaper
amici
have
tried
to
create,
the
government's
interpretation
of
"similar
files"
here
would
not
result
in
wholesale
nondisclosure
of
information
that
should
be
made
public.
the
court
should
keep
in
mind,
as
i
said
earlier,
that
even
if
something
qualifies
as
a
similar
file
under
a
threshold
test,
a
federal
agency
still
can't
withhold
the
information
unless
the
agency
also
determines
first
if
the
information
refers
to
a
specific
individual;
second,
that
disclosure
of
that
information
would
invade
that
individual's
privacy;
and
third
and
most
important,
that
any
such
invasion
of
personal
privacy
would
be
clearly
unwarranted
in
view
of
the
public
interest
in
disclosure.
that's
a
very,
very
difficult
burden
for
a
federal
agency
to
meet;
and
any
determinations
it
makes
in
this
area
is
of
course
judicially
reviewable.
but
in
contrast
to
the
d.c.
circuit's
test,
at
least
disclosure
decisions
under
this
approach
would
be
made
on
the
basis
15
of
rational
criteria
such
as
the
possibility
of
harm
to
the
individuals
involved
and
not
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
information
happens
to
be
in
one
file
rather
than
another,
or
whether
someone
might
consider
it
to
be
generically
intimate.
now,
what
we
ask
here
is
that
we
be
given
the
opportunity
to
show
that
the
information
related
to
specific
individuals
requested
by
the
washington
post
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
before
the
state
department
is
forced
to
release
that
information
to
the
public.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
hope
i
made
the
government's
position
clearer
to
the
court
than
i
apparently
made
it
to
mr.
kendall.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
to
you,
justice
white.
the
government's
position
on
the
threshold
test
is
that
any
document
that
refers
to
a
specific
individual
is
a
similar
file.
what
the
washington
post
says--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--any
document
in
the
government's
files
that
mentions
a
particular
individual
is
a
similar
file.
now,
all
that
means
is
that
you
then
go
on
to
the
balancing
test,
which
is
a
very
difficult
test
for
the
government
to
meet.
but
what
the
washington
post
says,
it
is
not--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
is
how
we...
that
is
what
we
think
is
the
common
denominator,
what
it
is
that
congress
meant
when
it
referred
to
personnel
or
medical
files.
those
are
files
that
almost
by
definition
refer,
mention
the
names
of
specific
individuals.
there
are
a
lot--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
that...
well,
but
not
all,
all
medical
and
personnel
files
are
filled
with
only
intimate
details.
that
was
the
point
that
i
made
in
my
opening
argument.
there's
a
lot
in
a
medical
or
personnel
file
that
is
not
intimate
at
all.
so
it
is
not
the
fact
that
a
detail
is
intimate
that's
the
common
denominator;
it's
the
fact
that
it
refers
to
a
specific--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
don't
think...
we
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think...
i
think
not,
justice
white.
there's
a
lot
of
information
in
government
files
that
doesn't
refer
to
any
individuals,
and
that
would
not
even
pass
the
threshold
test.
what
congress
said,
by
the
way,
and
what
this
court
said
in
the
rose
case
is
that
the
crucial
test
is
the
balancing
test,
and
that
congress
did
not
intend
large
amounts
of
information
to
be
screened
out
from
even
reaching
the
balancing
test
by
the
threshold
test.
but
that's
what
the
washington
post's
test
would
do.
i
should
point
out
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
class
of
information.
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
will
only
affect
information
that,
a)
does
not
contain
intimate
details
within
the
meaning
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
test,
but,
b)
the
government
could
show
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
if
it
were
released.
because
after
all,
if
we
couldn't
even
meet
the
balancing
test,
then
regardless
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
information
would
have
to
be
released,
and
it
would
be
of
only
academic
importance
whether
it
had
to
be
released
because
it
didn't
pass--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
would
think
that
it
would
have
to
be
a
live
person.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
be
the
person
about
whom--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
has
to
mention
a
name,
but
it
has
to...
these
are
two
parts
of
the
same
exemption.
they
have
to
be
related
to
each
other.
and
we
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--a
particular
individual.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
i
mean
mr.
kendall
says
we're
trying
to
relitigate
the
question
here.
we'd
like
to
have
one
appellate
determination
of
our
argument
that
this
would
be
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
what...
we
would
be
happy
to
have
this
court
announce
that
it
would
be
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion.
we
think
it
would
be
improper
for
this
court
without
adequate
briefing...
i
don't...
i
did
not
read
the
washington
post
brief
in
this
case
to
raise
that
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
the
district
court
found
that
we
met
the
similar
files
test.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
we
disagree,
obviously,
that
disclosure
of
this
information
would
not
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
you
agree
with
the
government
on?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
have
suggested
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
balancing
test
has
been
satisfied.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
briefed
that
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no.
the
only--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
have
not...
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
think
that
mr.
kendall
should
be
allowed
to
get
away
without
answering
the
chief
justice's
question.
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
the
washington
post
test
in
this
case
takes
any
account
of
the
fact
that
someone
might
be
harmed
by
the
release
of
this
personal
information,
and
the
answer
i
heard
had
something
to
do
with
balancing,
which
i
didn't
understand.
the
question...
the
upshot
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
test
which
the
washington
post
embraces
in
this
case
is
exactly
that.
the
fact
that
someone
might
be
harmed
is
irrelevant
if,
if
the
information
is
not
an
intimate
detail,
because
then
it
can't
meet
the
threshold
test,
and
you
never
have
to
reach
the
balancing
test.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
another
answer
that
he
gave,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
president
could...
at
the
moment
the
foia
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
matter.
it
can
be
dealt
with.
the
president
could
issue
some
executive
order.
perhaps
exemption
1
would
then
cover
the
situation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
assume
it
did.
the
district
court
did
not
write
an
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
we
don't
know
what--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
must
assume
that.
it
was
presented
to
the
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
an
interesting
question,
justice
o'connor.
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
seen
any
case
law
on
what
the
standard
is.
it
is
in
a
sense
and
in
some
ways
a
factual
determination,
and
perhaps
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
would
apply.
but
that
is
not
something
that
i
have
seen
litigated.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
would
gain
the
opportunity
to
have
an
appellate
resolution
of
the
question
of
whether
the
disclosure
of
this
information
would
be
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
the
government
would
withhold
that
information,
which
is
very
likely...
we're
only
talking
here...
obviously
the
government
can
release
the
information
under
the
foia.
we're
talking
about
a
case
that
the
government
has
decided
not
to
release
because
it
believes
it
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
the
fact
that
it
relates
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
would
say
it's
a
similar
file,
and
the
fact
that
it
is
public
or
is
required
to
be
filed
publicly
would
be
very,
very
weighty
in
terms
of
how
the
balancing
test
should
come
out,
and
it
would
almost
certainly
have
to
be
disclosed.
but
that's
a
separate
question
from
saying
that
the
government
is
not
even
entitled
to
make
its
argument
that
it
would
be
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
now,
just
one
or
two
more
things,
if
i
may.
justice
powell
asked
a
question
about
whether
harm
is
something
the
congress
was
concerned
about,
physical
harm,
when
it
passed
exemption
6.
and
the
answer
that
i
heard
is
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
congress
didn't
mean
to
include
that.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
house
report
which
is
quoted
at
page
19
of
the
government's
brief
in
which
the
house
says
that,
"the
limitation,
exemption
6,
provides
a
balance
between
protection
of
48
the
right
to
privacy
and
the
preservation
of
the
public's
right
to
government
information
by
excluding
those
kinds
of
files,
the
disclosure
of
which
might
harm
the
individual.
"
so
we
agree
with
mr.
kendall
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear.
and
just
finally
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
the
regulations
do
provide
that
when
an
american
citizen
expatriates
himself
that
the
state
department
is
to
send
the
record
to
the
ins,
which
is
to
send
the
record
to
the
naturalization
court.
as
mr.
kendall
said,
there's
nothing
in
the
regulation
that
prohibits
keeping
that
information
secret
when
it's
filed;
but
there
is
another
answer
as
well,
and
that
is
that
the
regulation
doesn't
provide
any
time
limit
within
which
the
state
department
has
to
forward
the
information
to
the
ins
or
the
ins
has
to
forward
the
information
to
the
naturalization
court.
so
it
might
well
be...
we
don't
know
whether
the
ins
in
fact
gave
the
information
to
the
washington
post
that
they
suggest...
but
it
might
well
be
that
the
ins
was
totally
unaware
if
in
fact
mr.
yazdi
had
expatriated
himself,
if
in
fact
he
was
a
citizen
to
begin
with.
thank
you.
