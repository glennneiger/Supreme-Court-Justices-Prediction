unknown
speaker
if
we
should
agree
with
you,
mr.
geller,
do
we
sent
it
back
for
consideration
of
that
element?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
decide
that
here.
unknown
speaker
i'm
curious
as
to
why
you
say
there
would
have
to
be
a
remand.
is
the
balancing
test
performed
on
the
basis
of
a
lot
of
facts
that
would
be
have
to
be
ascertained
at
a
trial,
or
is
it
just
the
judgment
of
the
court
before
which
the
matter
is
pending
that
on
balance,
you
know,
a
wins
or
b
wins?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
facts
does
the
district
court
weigh?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
seem
rather
anomalous,
though,
that
information
which
is
contained
in
admittedly
public
records
would
be
categorized
as
information
to
which
the
balancing
test
might
apply
and
which
could
be
withheld?
unknown
speaker
out
of
favor
where,
back
home?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
could
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
take
it,
and
tell
them
to
review
judge
robinson's
finding.
unknown
speaker
why?
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
agreed
with
the...
had
gotten
to
the...
gotten
to
the
balancing
test.
they
would
have
had
to
review
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
was
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
we
do
that
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know,
but
we
don't
have
to...
we
don't
have
to
listen
to
a
respondent's
alternative--
unknown
speaker
--we're
entitled
to,
and
you're
entitled
to
present
it,
but
we
don't
have
to.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
go
after
the
public
record.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
seek
out
the
public
record.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
big
job.
unknown
speaker
is
that
clear
in
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
it's
totally
irrelevant
of
course,
but
i
take
it
this
information
was
of
great
concern
to
the
washington
post?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
this
weighing
process.
there
have
been
some
examples
given.
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
respond
to
this
hypothetical.
suppose
any
one
of
these
dangerous
dictatorships...
you
pick
him
out...
announces
that
any
citizens
of
that
country
within
the
boundaries
of
who
have
relatives
who
are
in
the
united
states
who
work
for
the
united
states
government
will
be
put
into
concentration
camps
for
the
obvious
purpose
of
blackmailing.
now,
certainly
public
payrolls
are,
generally
speaking,
matters
of
public
record.
do
you
say
the
government
could
not
withhold
that
information
so
as
to
protect
those
employees
if
there
are
some
employees
from
extortionate
blackmailing
efforts,
since
we
know
that
with
nazi
germany
that
happened
regularly?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
are
you
saying
that
tomorrow
an
executive
order
could
be
entered
classifying
all
information
relating
to
these
two
gentlemen
and
that
would
close
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
no.
it
would
be
a
little
different.
it's
a
little
different
from
the
washington
post
saying
somebody's
an
american
citizen
and
the
state
department
saying
that
somebody's
an--
unknown
speaker
--there
is
a
slight
difference.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
difference
between
ins
and
the
state
department
on
citizenship.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
you
want
it?
unknown
speaker
if
it
didn't
have
any
import,
why
did
you
want
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kendall,
on
page
20
of
your
brief
you
have
a
sentence
in
bold
type
that
came
as
a
shock
to
me
when
i
read
it:
"information
is
not
private
simply
because
its
disclosure
might
lead
to
embarrassment
or
even
physical
harm.
"
does
that...
does
that
state
the
position
of
the
washington
post;
regardless
of
physical
harm,
information
is
not
private?
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
make
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
not
talk
about
embarrassing
because
politicians
embarrass
each
other
or
try
to
all
the
time,
but
putting
someone
in
physical
danger
goes
rather
far,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
congress
intended,
intended
that
public
information...
that
information
be
made
public
that
would
endanger
the
life
or
safety
of
american
citizens
or
foreign
persons
who
had
been
here?
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
say
i
thought
the
privacy
issue
was
a
second
issue
in
this
case.
perhaps
we
don't
get
to
it.
the
first
issue
is
a
similar
test.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
reach
the
privacy
issue,
as
you
argue
that
we
should,
how
to
we
dispose
of
that
particular
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
arguing
that
republication
would
not
endanger
the
individual.
the
point
i'm
making,
if
it
would
endanger
the
safety,
of
an
individual,
are
you
contending
on
the
balancing
test
that
the
information
nevertheless
should
be
released?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you
get
the
expectation
of
privacy?
that
sounds
like
fourth
amendment
language.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
cases
from
this
court
other
than
rose
that
you
rely
on
for
the
"expectation
of
privacy"?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
that
a
personnel
file,
for
example,
has
a
great
deal
of
information
that
no
one
would
have
much
expectation
of
privacy,
if
that's
the
proper
test,
because
a
typical
personnel
file
has
a
person's
date
of
birth,
date
of
marriage,
date
of
divorce
sometimes,
when
you
are
sworn
in
at
the
army,
when
you're
admitted
to
the
bar...
a
lot
of
factors
are
facts
of
public
record.
and
yet
no
one
denies
that
a
personnel
file
has
to
go
through
this
balancing
test.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
defend
here
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
that
you
don't
even
get
to
the
balancing
test
because
it's
not
a
"similar
file".
unknown
speaker
so
is
your
date
of
birth,
so
is
your
date
of
marriage,
so
is
the
date
on
which
you're
admitted
to
the
bar.
unknown
speaker
but
then
what
is
the
link,
what
is
the
justem
generis
factor
that
you
apply
to
get
a
hold
of
similar
files
when
you're
dealing
with,
a)
medical
files,
and
b)
personnel
files?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
frankly
don't
follow
your
suggestion
that
a
naturalization
file
is
all
that
different
from
a
personnel
file.
doesn't
a
person
make
an
application
to
be
naturalized?
unknown
speaker
as
is--
unknown
speaker
--are
we
dealing
here
with
the
naturalization
file
or
just
the
fact
of
citizenship?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
this
would
expose
these
people
to
no
danger
whatever,
or
that
even
if
it
does
expose
them
to
danger,
you're
entitled
to
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
two
journalist
sources.
unknown
speaker
aren't
they
more
reliable
than
the
government
for
your
purposes?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you're
wrong
you'll
just
say
oops,
we
were
wrong.
you're
willing
to
take
the
risk.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
you've
already
published
the
story,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
you've
got
all
of
this,
so
what
do
you
need
more
for?
because
they
haven't
done
it
to
them
yet?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
would
that
document
be
a
matter
of
public
record
if
he
had?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
with
the
transmittal
letter
there
was
a
request
to
keep
this
in
camera?
would
there
be
anything
to
prohibit
the
district
court
clerk
from
doing
that,
and
just
filing
it
in
his
desk
drawer
with
the
permission
or
letter
from
the
chief
judge
or
something
saying
we've
been
requested
to
do
this;
we'll
just
keep
it
private.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
would
prohibit
it
is
my
question.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
in
fast
danger
to
a
man's
life,
it
is
conceivable
that
that
might
be
done,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
would
prevent
one
from
finding
out
whether
in
fact
he
had
renounced,
because
conceivably
he
might
have
told
someone
wherever
he
is
i
renounced
my
citizenship.
maybe
he's
telling
the
truth
and
maybe
he
isn't.
but
you
want
to
find
out
whether
it
would
be
if
that
weren't
the
case.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
possibly
he
could
have
renounced,
and
it
might
not
be
a
matter
of
public
record.
maybe
that's
why
you
can't
find
it.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
would
prohibit
it.
unknown
speaker
so
then
we
can't
be
positive
that
it's
a
matter
of
public
record.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
not,
presumably,
a
normal
case
by
hypothesis,
if
the
government
is
to
be
believed.
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
or
not.
there
is
something
exceptional
about
this
particular
individual
that
requires
exceptional
protection
of
this
particular
fact.
unknown
speaker
now,
even
the
dates
might
be
terribly
crucial
here.
suppose,
for
example,
that
one
of
these
men
had
renounced
his
citizenship
by
a
letter
to
the
government,
the
secretary
of
state
or
whomever,
in
which
he
made
a
strong
attack
on
the
former
regime
of
the
shah
and
renounced
his
citizenship
on
that
grounds.
that
would
make
him
a
hero
in
iran
today.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
renounced...
if
he
gained
his
citizenship
after
the
revolution,
that
wouldn't
make
him
much
of
a
hero
in
iran
today,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
still
maintain
that
the
government
isn't
entitled
to
try
to
protect
these
people
from
that
risk.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kendall,
there's
a
second
individual
involved,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
you've
referred
only
to
the
disclosures
about
dr.
yazdi
and
have
not
referred
to
dr.
behazdnia.
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
finding
extend
to
him
as
well?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kendall,
how
do
you
understand
the
government
to
characterize
the
similar
records
that
are
entitled
to
the
balancing
test?
how
would
they
describe
them?
they
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
characterization
of
such
records.
how
do
you
think
they
described
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
different
from
the
court
of
appeals
said?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
government
was
disagreeing
with
the
standard
the
court
of
appeals
applied
to
that
question.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
they're
really
just
disagreeing
on
the
facts
with
the
application
of
the
standard
as
to
whether
this
is
a
similar
record.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
government
is
suggesting
that
if
in
any
particular
file
there's
something
that's
embarrassing
or
dangerous
or
"personal",
"then
automatically
it's
a
similar
file?
"
unknown
speaker
and
to
me.
unknown
speaker
any...
any
document.
unknown
speaker
so
you
really
just
take
out
the
word
"similar".
unknown
speaker
you
just
say
any
other
file
that
mentions
an
individual.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
have
particular
kinds
of
information
about
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
much
of
a...
it's
41
not
much
of
a
threshold
determination
then,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
it
really
is
an
empty,
almost
an
empty
gesture.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
file...
would
it...
any
file
that
mentioned
any
person
who
is
now
alive
or
dead
or
what?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
the
person
about
whom
you
would
want
to
do
the
balancing
test
in?
unknown
speaker
or
could
it
be
a
different
person?
unknown
speaker
why,
if
it
just
has
to
mention
a
name?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
geller,
is
this
to
suggest
all
we
need
say
is
all
"similar
files"
mean
is
identify
by
name
a
given
individual?
unknown
speaker
therefore,
vacate
and
send
back
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--court
of
appeals
to
apply
the--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean
you
want
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
you
suggest.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
geller,
do
you...
i
take
it
you
do
not
agree
with
the
district
court
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
they
didn't
agree
with
you
on--
unknown
speaker
--and
do
you
think...
if
we
agree
with
you,
what
should
we
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
similar
files
issue.
unknown
speaker
you
haven't...
have
you...
you
haven't
briefed
that
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
haven't
briefed
it
here.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
think
we
should
even
deal
with
that.
unknown
speaker
i
took
his
answer
to
mean
that
that's
the
law
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
counsel,
did
the
district
court
when
it
applied
the
balancing
test
consider
the
danger
to
the
individual?
unknown
speaker
you
assume
it
did?
unknown
speaker
and
rejected
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and
then
if
we
sent
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
would
it
have
to
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
standard?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
where
even
if
you
won
up
here
you'd
gain
anything.
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
say
that
even
a
congressional
act
that,
for
instance,
required
certain
employees
to
file
certain
public
information
statements
or
reports
would
fall
in
the
similar
files
category,
so
that
the
court
has
to
balance
whether
that
ought
to
be
released
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
technically
it
was
a
similar
file.
unknown
speaker
the
honoroable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
after
at
ten
o
clock.
