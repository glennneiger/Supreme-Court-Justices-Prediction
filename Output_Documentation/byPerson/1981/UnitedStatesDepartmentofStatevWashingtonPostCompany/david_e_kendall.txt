mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
courts:
i
waited
expectantly
for
my
brother
geller
to
tell
the
court
what
district
court
judge
robinson
found
in
this
case.
since
he
didn't
do
so,
i'm
going
to
have
to
do
so,
because
we
come
to
this
court
having
won
a
judgment
in
the
district
court
and
having
sustained
that
judgment
on
appeal.
now,
as
the
respondent
in
this
court,
under
the
settled
precedents
of
this
court
we
can
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
there
is
any
ground
on
which
it
can
be
sustained.
and
i
want
to
make
quite
clear
at
the
outset
we
are
defending
that
judgment
not
only
on
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
its
similar
files
analysis,
but
also
on
the
ground
that
judge
robinson's
balancing
test
was
correct,
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
supererogatory
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
government
has
consistently
ignored
what
the
district
court
did,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
its
conduct
of
the
balancing
test,
which
we
submit
was
correct,
is
an
alternative
ground
on
which
we
rely,
because
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
have
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
unless
you
also
find
that
judge
robinson
was
wrong.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
i
think
to
do
that,
justice
rehnquist,
you
would
have
to
find
that
judge
robinson's
conduct
of
the
balancing
test
was
wrong
and
would
change
the
outcome
of
the
court
below?
mr.
david
e.
kendall
they
would,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
you
do
because
that
is
a
ground
on
which
the
decision
of
the
court
below
may
be
sustained.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
an--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--that's
quite
true.
we're
submitting
two
grounds
here.
i
just
want
to
make
plain
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
but
we
also
think
judge
robinson
was
right
in
his
conduct
of
the
balancing
test.
this
case
arises
out
of
our
request
for
department
of
state
records
that
would
indicate
whether
or
not
these
two
iranian
officials,
dr.
all
behzadnia
and
dr.
ibrahim
yazdi,
were
currently
u.s.
citizens.
now,
it
is
not
correct
that
the
saunders
affidavit
submitted
by
the
government
was
unrebutted
in
the
district
court.
we
contended
on
our
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
first
of
all
that
the
information
at
issue
was
plainly
a
matter
of
public
record.
we
submitted
a
memorandum
setting
forth
the
applicable
statutes
and
regulations,
and
that
memorandum
and
the
affidavit
of
our
legal
researcher
is
uncontroverted.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
we
did
not
seek...
we
were
not
able
to
find
this
information
because
there
are
95--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--federal
naturalization
courts.
we'll
lose
one
tomorrow
in
the
canal
zone.
there
are
about
300
state
courts.
we
were
not
able
to
find
it,
but
of
course,
the
difficulty
of
locating
a
public
record
is
one
of
the
reasons
the
foia
was
enacted
in
the
first
place,
to
make
access
to
public--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--i
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
the
discussions
particularly
as
to
the
first
parts
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
we
had
printed
a
story
saying
that
yazdi
was...
that
the
ins,
which
is
in
the
justice
department,
not
the
state
department,
had
confirmed
that
he
was
in
fact
an
american
citizen.
we
were
seeking
to
learn
whether
there
had
in
the
very
recent
past
been
any
renunciation
of
that
citizenship
which
would
have
been
possessed
in
a
record
by
the
state
department.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice,
if
that
kind
of
a
requirement
were
announced
by
a
foreign
country
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i
think
the
government's
response
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
would
be
an
executive
order
which
would
classify
such
information,
and
then
the
government
would
be
able
to
rely
on
exemption
1,
the
national
security
exemption.
so
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
response
in
such
a
hypothetical
case.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
relates
to
the
balancing
test
as
it
was
conducted
in
the
district
court.
one
of
the...
and
i
disagree
that
the
saunders
affidavit
was
unrebutted.
one
of
the
points
we
had
made
was
that
the
washington
post
had
already
published
a
story
three
months
before
the
saunders
affidavit
was
executed
stating
that
yazdi
was
an
american
citizen.
this
we
attach
as
exhibit
4
to
our
summary
judgment
memorandum.
it
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
35
to
38.
it
appeared...
it
was
by
post
reporter
bill
branigan
and
ran
on
october
the
4th.
if
i
could
just
read
the
two
lines
of
particular
moment
in
that
article.
"according
to
the
u.s.
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
yazdi
was
admitted
as
a
permanent
u.s.
resident
in
july
1962
and
became
a
naturalized
american
citizen
on
march
19,
1971.
"
"the
agency
said
yazdi
had
not
yet
renounced
his
u.s.
citizenship.
"
now,
the
point
we
made
to
judge
robinson
was
we
had
already
run
a
story
stating
that
dr.
ibrahim
yazdi
was
naturalized
and
remained
a
u.s.
citizen.
we
had
given
our
source,
a
government
agency,
the
ins.
if
we
could
get
the
state
department
records
that
we
sought
and
if
they
confirmed
the
ins
report,
all
we
could
do
would
be
to
run
a
similar
story.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
justice--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--mr.
justice
marshall,
i
agree
with
that,
but
our
story
here
quoted
ins.
my
point
was
that
the
first
story--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--there
is
a
difference,
but
i
would
submit
it's
a
difference
without
very
much
import
here,
because
both
ins
and--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--well,
we
wanted
it
as--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--we
wanted
it
to
make
sure
that
yazdi
was
still
an
american
citizen.
one
of
the
ways
you
can
lose
your
citizenship
is
to
renounce
it
at
an
embassy
abroad.
what
happens
then
is
then
the
consular
official
will
certify
that
fact
and
send
a
certificate
of
loss
of
nationality
back
to
the
justice
department.
that's
required
by
statute.
and
then
the
justice
department
sends
it
to
the
court
of
naturalization.
so
we
thought
that
this
renunciation
might
have
happened
in
the
interim.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
justice
powell,
we
submit
that
that
does
not
make
information
private.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
it
makes
it
either
endangering
or
embarrassing,
not
private.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
justice
powell,
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear
here,
that
various
other
cases
are--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--we
think
that
is
quite
a
different
question
than
the
question
of
a
privacy
interest.
we
believe
that
in
the
district
court
we
met
our
burden
of
showing
that
that
information
would
not
in
fact
be
endangering.
but
there
are
many
kinds--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
i
think
that
you
do
so
in
light
of
the
evidence
of,
in
this
record,
a
prior
washington
post
story
citing
an
official
government
agency
stating
that
yazdi
was
and
remained
a
u.s.
citizen.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
no.
on
the
balancing
test
if
the
information
were
such
that
there
was
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
on
the
balancing
test
endangerment
would
be
one
of
the
things
weighed
in
that
balance.
we're
contending
here,
however,
that
because
of
the
way
the
process
of
naturalization
has
been
established
by
congress,
because
every
part
of
that
process
is
held
open
to
public
scrutiny,
because
the
records
of
it
are
required
by
statute
to
be
public
that
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
holding
on
that
basis
that
these
were
not
similar
files;
in
other
words,
that
the
threshold
requirement
of
exemption
6
was
not
met.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
it's
drawn
from
many
cases.
the
court
here
when
it
was
construing
exemption
6
in
rose
talked
of
the
implication
of
similar
privacy
values
when
it
was
talking
about
the
honor
and
ethics
files
of
the
air
force
academy.
the
cases,
though,
the
court
of
appeals
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
have
made
quite
clear,
i
think,
that
privacy
expectations
are
critical
in
determining
whether
something
qualifies
for
exemption
6,
because
the--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--the
rose
case
is
the
only
case
construing
exemption
5.
we
have
to
look
basically
there.
we
think
that
precedents
from
privacy
cases
and
other
constitutional
cases
of
this
court,
such
as
paul
v.
davis,
cox
broadcasting
corporation
v.
cohen,
provide
useful
and
instructive
analogies.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
that's
exactly
right,
but
what
comes
out
at
the
end
of
the
balancing
test,
of
course,
according
to
this
court's
construction
of
exemption
6
in
rose
is
that
all
of
that
information
as
to
which
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy
would
be
disclosed.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
couldn't
be
withheld.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
that's
correct,
but
there
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
reasoned
that
as
to
citizenship
information,
given
the
public
nature
of
the
process,
it's
a
quite
different
kind
of
fact
about
you
than
many
other
facts
that
may
be
in
government
records.
that
process
is
public
from
inception
to
the
very
end.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
if
those
facts
were
requested
from
the
government...
a
government
agency,
and
they
didn't
come
from
personnel
files,
they
would
not
qualify
as
similar
files.
they
qualify
as
similar
files
in
your
hypothetical
simply
because
they
are
in
personnel
files.
congress
has
explicitly
made
personnel
files
one
of
the
things
as
to
which
you've
got
to
apply
the
balancing
test.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
i
think
the
best...
it's
hard
to
give
a
description
that
is
very
concrete
because
so
many
possible
kinds
of
facts
may
be
encompassed.
i
think
the
best
test
is
that
of
this
court
in
rose.
it
asked
of
these
air
force
academy
disciplinary
files
are
similar
facts
or
similar
privacy
values
implicated.
the
court
also
quoted
the
legislative
history
which
indicated
that
congress
had
in
mind
intimate
facts
and
personal
details
about
an
individual.
the
legislative
history
of
exemption
6
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
is
similar
in
that
it
quotes
some
kinds
of
files,
and
then
it
refers
to
in
one
house
intimate
details,
in
the
other
highly
personal
facts.
and
i
think
that's
the
best
you
can
do
as
a
threshold
definition.
and
i
think
given
that
threshold
definition
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
correct
in
saying
that
as
to
naturalization
files,
those
simply
do
not
implicate
the
same
kind
of
values,
they
don't
relate
to
a
person's
family,
medical
condition,
drinking
habits,
finances,
religious
practices
and
many
other
things.
they
are
generically
public.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
he
does,
and
under,
i
believe
it's
8
u.s.c.
14-1841,
that
naturalization
petition
is
a
matter
of
public
record.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
if
you
know
where
to
look
for
it.
as
is
a
birth
certificate
if
you
know
where
to
look
for
it.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
justice
o'connor,
we're
dealing
basically
with
the
latter.
in
framing
an
foia
request,
of
course,
you
can't
simply
ask
a
question;
you've
got
to
ask
for
records.
our
request
was
please
give
us
any
reference
you
have
indicating
whether
or
not
now
these
two
men
are
u.s.
citizens.
that
is
a
question
that
could
have
been
answered
over
the
phone
yes
or
no.
so
it
would
not...
we
don't
even
know
all
the
records
that
the
state
department
might
have.
and
in
our
request
letter
of
september
the
11th
we
indicated
that
if
the
records
we
requested
contained
any
other
information,
that
information
could
be
redacted.
all
we
wanted
was
that
indicating
whether
or
not
at
that
time
the
two
men
were
citizens.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can't
say
because
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
expose
them
to
no
danger.
we
do
know,
however,
that
these
books
we've
cited
in
our
suggestion
that
certiorari
was
improvidently
granted
to
contain
statements
from
high
state
department
officials
as
to
the
very
information
we
seek.
this
book,
200,
which
we
quoted
in
our
brief,
"ibrahim
yazdi,
an
iranian
immigrant
to
the
united
states,
lived
many
years
in
houston
and
acquired
u.s.
nationality.
"
likewise,
the
other
book,
also
published
last
november,
"inside
the
iranian
revolution",
written
by
a
current
state
department
employee,
director
of
the
emergency
operations
center,
had
a
similar
statement
about
yazdi.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
they
are
journalist
sources,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
they
are
in
a--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--that
is
true,
and
we
submit
that
they
are
reliable.
that
makes
all
the
more...
that,
it
seems
to
me,
undercuts
the
government's
prediction
of
likely
harm.
we
don't
think,
and
judge
robinson
didn't
think
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
was
a
sufficient
showing
of
harm...
of
likelihood
of
harm
to
withhold
the
information.
now,
these
books
are
not
dispositive,
but
if
you're
going
to
assume
that
a
regime
is
so
irrational
to
visit
harm
on
one
of
its
people
because
that
person
is
an
american
citizen,
it
seems
to
us
highly
unlikely
that
they
would
distinguish
in
a
nicely
discriminating
fashion
between
books
written
by
a
former
ambassador
to
iran
and
a
current
high
state
department
employee
and
what
we
would
print
on
the
basis
of
state
department
records.
so
to
answer
your
question,
i
can't
say
for
certain,
but
we
think
that
the
government's
claims
of
possible
harm
have
got
to
be
taken
with
great
skepticism
here.
the
ins
released
the
information--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--well,
there's
no
very
good
answer--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--exactly.
based
upon
what
ins
has
said.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
fact
cuts
in
our
favor.
we
want
to
know
whether
yazdi
has
in
fact
renounced
his
citizenship.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
it
would.
it's
required
by
8
u.s.c.
1501
that
the
certificate
of
loss
of
nationality
be
transmitted
from
the
state
department
to
the
justice
department.
the
justice
department
regulations
we
quote
require
that
in
the
case
of
a
naturalized
citizen
to
be
transmitted
back
to
the
naturalization
court.
now,
the
affidavit
of
our
researcher,
paul
wolfe,
paul
de
wolfe,
which
the
government
admits
is
uncontroverted,
indicates
that
the
practice
of
the
courts
is
invariably
to
put
the
loss
of
citizenship--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
would
authorize
that.
the
statutes
are--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--i
don't
think
there's
anything
that
prohibits--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--well,
i
think,
though,
that
you'd
only
be
addressing
half
the
danger.
the
danger
to
the
man's
life
would
be
the
naturalization
petition,
which
has
been
granted.
presumably
it
would
not
be
the
renunciation
petition.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
as
i
say,
there
is
no...
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
would
authorize
such
in
camera--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--i
don't
know
of
any
direct
prohibition
in
the--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--we
can't
be
positive,
but
given
all
that
the
public
records
require,
given
the
consistent
treatment
of
ins--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--but
the
protection
that
would
be
required
here,
justice
stevens,
under
the
government's
own
theory
would
not
be
a
question
of
the
renunciation
of
citizenship
protection.
it
would
be,
and
again,
under
the
saunders
affidavit
itself,
the
fact
yazdi
was
an
american
citizen.
and
there
is
certainly
nothing...
the
statute
affirmatively
declares
that
that
record
will
be
kept
public.
so
under
their
theory,
to
protect
yazdi
what
you
need
to
do
is
get
rid
of
the
entire
file,
and
that
they
can't
do
by
statute.
there
is
a
prohibition
as
to
that.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
from
what
i
know
about
the
iranian
situation,
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
is
bound
by
the
freedom
of
information
act.
in
this
case
i
think
that
the
issue
has
been
joined
as
to
the
possible
danger
to
yazdi.
they
have
lost
that
issue
in
the
district
court
before
chief
justice...
or
before
judge
robinson.
they're
trying
to
relitigate
the
question
here.
he
applied
the
balancing
test
and
found
the
affidavit
and
submissions
in
support
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
persuasive.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
there
is.
dr.
ali
behzadnia.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
story
that
the
post
ran
concerned
only
dr.
yazdi.
we
have
submitted
an
article
from
the
iran
times
indicating
dr.
behzadnia
was
in
michigan.
all
this
record
reveals
is
that
there
is
uncertainty
as
to
his
whereabouts.
but
the
argument
we
would
make
would
apply
equally
to
dr.
behzadnia.
there
is
no
showing,
and
the
government's
affidavit
doesn't
make
any
showing
that
he
is
in
any
peculiar
circumstances.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
the
district
court
finding
extended
to
both
me
in
the
order
that
the
district
court
entered
on
march
11,
1980.
this
case--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--i
have
some
difficulty
knowing
what
their
position
is,
but
i
don't
think
it
in
fact
differs
very
much
from
ours.
as
a
definitional
matter
it
seems
to
me
about
the
best
you
can
do
on
the
similar
files
question
is
to
say
that
something
will
qualify
and
be
treated
as
a
similar
file
for
purposes
of
possible
withholding
under
exemption
6
if
it
implicates
the
same
kinds
of
personal
privacy
values--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--i
don't
believe
it
is.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--they
are,
but
you
asked
me
what
their
test
is.
i
think
it's
very
much
like
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
and
i
think
it's
very
much
like
what
this
court
found
in
rose.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
i
believe
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
that
definitionally
there
is
very
much
disagreement,
because
if
you
look
at
the
language
used,
whether
the
emphasis
is
on
intimate
or
personal,
the
thing
that
makes
files
potentially
like
medical
or
personnel
files
is
the
intimacy
or
the
personal
detail
of
those
files.
the
government
has
what
is
a
very--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
--exactly.
i
think
their
threshold
requirement
would
be
so
expansive
as
to
let
any
fact,
no
matter
how
publicly
known,
be
a
matter
of
withholding.
and
i
think
that
would
completely
destroy
the
threshold
requirement
that
congress
has
enacted
in
exemption
6,
and
i
think
it
would
also
distort
the
shape
of
the
foia
in
a
very
significant
fashion.
this
court
has
always
emphasized
when
it
reviewed
the
legislative
history
of
foia
that
the
exemptions
were
made
exclusive,
that
they
were
to
be
construed
narrowly,
and
it
was
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
information
qualified
under
a
particular
exemption.
given
the
government's
theory,
we
would
back
in
the
old
days
of
section
3
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
let
a
government
agency
withhold
information,
any
kind
of
information,
simply
for
good
cause
shown.
for
all
these
reasons
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgement
should
be
affirmed
or
that
the
court
should
dismiss
here
as
improvidently
granted.
