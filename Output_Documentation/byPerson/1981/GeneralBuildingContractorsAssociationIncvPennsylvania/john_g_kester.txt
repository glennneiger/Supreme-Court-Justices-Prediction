mr.
john
g.
kester
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
coming
before
you
this
afternoon
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
forgotten
persons
in
this
case,
the
three
trade
associations
who
were
held
liable,
along
with
the
employers,
along
with
the
apprenticeship
committee
and
along
with
the
union
for
discrimination
which
was
practiced
by
the
union.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
with
a
very
sharp
and
very
clear
legal
issue,
and
that
issue
is
not
whether
the
victims
of
racial
discrimination
may
recover
under
1981
against
the
discriminator.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
how
far
that
liability
under
section
1981
is
to
be
extended.
the
issue
is,
in
that
respect,
not
whether
1981
reaches
private
action,
but
whether
it
also
extends
to
reach
private
inaction,
and
the
issue
is
very
sharp
because
the
case
comes
up
with
the
benefit
of
some
unusually
candid,
clear
and
conscientious
findings
by
the
district
judge
who
tried
the
case.
the
district
judge
found,
as
mr.
mcaleese
said,
that
the
associations
did
not
discriminate,
they
didn't
know
the
discrimination
was
going
on,
and
they
didn't
even
have
reason
to
know
that
the
discrimination
was
going
on.
and
i
think,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
at
least
a
partial
answer
to
the
question
you
raised
to
mr.
mcaleese
before.
we
have
in
this
case
a
clear,
specific
finding
that
they
didn't
have
knowledge
or
notice,
and
i
think
that
this
court,
unlike
the
naacp
case
that
was
before
you
a
little
while
ago,
where
there
is
some
contention
among
the
parties
as
to
what
is
a
finding
of
fact
and
what
is
a
conclusion,
we
don't
have
any
of
that
in
this
case.
it's
clear
findings
of
fact
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
there
was
no
appeal
from
those
findings
of
fact,
and
we
all
take
it
on
that
basis.
now,
what
this
court
has
to
wrestle
with
are
the
legal
conclusions
of
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
was
equally
candid
about
what
his
legal
conclusions
were,
too.
he
was
persuaded
on
the
authority
mainly
of
a
case
called
davis
against
los
angeles,
which
the
court
will
remember,
which
this
court
subsequently
vacated,
he
was
persuaded
that
1981
liability
should
be
greatly
extended
beyond
the
discriminators,
beyond
the
people
who
dealt
with
the
discriminators
to
my
client,
the
general
building
contractors
association
of
philadelphia,
which
did
nothing
more
than
negotiate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
the
union
later
violated.
now,
to
reach
that
conclusion...
and
unfortunately
the
legal
reasoning
in
this
case
is
a
little
bit
murkier
than
the
findings
of
fact...
to
reach
that
conclusion
he
first
concluded
that
1981
does
not
require
any
proof
of
intent
to
discriminate.
he
said
that
even
though
they
had
no
knowledge
and
notice
of
the
discrimination,
the
associations
were
liable
even
though
they
weren't
employers,
because
not
one
operating
engineer
has
ever
been
employed
by
one
of
my
clients.
my
clients
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
if
an
operating
engineer
came
in
the
door.
they
are
an
office.
they
are
people
sitting
at
desks,
and
all
they
do
is
administer
administrative
matters
for
the
members
of
the
association.
i'd
like
to
just
touch
briefly,
before
we
go
any
further,
on
this
question
of
non-delegable
duty.
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that,
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
you
two
have
framed
essentially
two
alternative
ways
of
deciding
the
case,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
i
think
non-delegable
duty
is
a
word
that,
in
essence
it
begs
the
question.
there
is
a
lot
of
jargon
floating
around
in
this
case.
non-delegable
duty
is
one
of
the
bits
of
jargon
that's
there.
but
a
duty
not
to
discriminate
does
not
exist
in
a
void.
duties
are
something
that
somebody
owes
to
somebody
else,
and
the
question
before
the
court
is,
with
respect
to
my
client,
what
kind
of
duty
did
my
client
owe
to
the
people
who
were
discriminated
against
by
the
union,
like
local
542.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they
were
signatories
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
agents
of
the
employers
whom
they
represented.
in
other
words,
they
were...
what
the
district
court
was
doing
i
think
was--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no.
they
were
simply,
they
were
simply
the
agents.
mr.
john
g.
kester
for
the
employers,
for
the
members
of
the
associations,
and
then
other
employers
who
followed
the
contract.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they
negotiated
the
contract.
they
negotiated
the
contract,
mr.
justice
marshall,
a
contract
which
the
district
court
found--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--was
absolutely
legal,
valid,
and
non-discriminatory.
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
towards
the
end
it
included
a
specific
nondiscrimination
clause
in
it.
and
they
were
responsible
for
that.
that's
their
responsibility.
they
negotiated
a
contract
which
was
perfectly
legal.
now,
if
you
believe
that
section
1981
requires
intent
to
discriminate...
and
i
would
urge
the
court
that
it
does
based
on
authority
of
washington
v.
davis,
one
could
even
argue
that
that
was
decided
in
washington
v.
davis
although
not
discussed
very
much
because
1981
was
involved
in
washington
v.
davis,
but
1981
certainly
does
require
intent
to
discriminate.
that's
what
this
court
has
held
with
respect
to
practically
all
the
civil
rights
legislation
that
has
come
up
before
it.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
wouldn't
even
say
they
owed
a
duty,
of
course.
mr.
john
g.
kester
but
certainly,
yes,
we
are
one
step
removed.
i
mean,
if
you
think
of
the
union's
discrimination
as
the
sun,
the
employers
are--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no,
i
would
never
say
that,
mr.
justice
white.
and
it
is
certainly
not
true.
if
you
think
of
the
union
as
the
sun
of
discrimination,
the
employers
are
maybe
sitting
out
there
like
the
planet
pluto,
and
we
are
some
distant
start.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
there
wasn't
anything
that
my
clients
could
have
done
about
the
discrimination
that
took
place.
it
is--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that's
right,
except,
except
there
may
be
administrative
matters
that
come
along,
paperwork
kinds
of
things,
but
the
employees
are
referred
by
the
union
to
the
employers.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
grievance
procedures,
mr.
justice
white,
are
brought
against
individual
employers
by--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
right.
by
employees
and
through
the
union
against
employers.
that's
right.
we
aren't
involved
in
it.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
all
i--
now,
one
confusion
that
has
entered
into
this
case,
i
think,
as
it
came
up
to
this
court
is
a
discussion
i
notice
in
the
respondent's
brief
of
the
hiring
hall,
and
it's
almost
written
in
capital
letters
as
if
the
hiring
hall
is
some
kind
of
a
separate
entity
here
that
involves
both
the
employers
and
the
union,
although
again
i
have
to
point
out
that
we
aren't
even
the
employers.
i'm
representing
the
associations.
now--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
jatc,
joint
apprenticeship
and
training
program,
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
joint
apprenticeship
and
training
program
has
six
trustees,
and
three
of
those
are
from
the
associations
and
three
of
them
are
from
the
union.
now,
those
trustees
are
acting
on
their
own.
they
come
from
that
source,
but
they
are...
the
jatc
is
a
totally
separate
entity.
there's
nothing
in
the
district
court's
opinion
that
ever
suggested
that
liability
could
be
rested
on
the
associations
because
they
appointed
three
of
the
members
of
the
jatc.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
appointment
is
from
the
associations,
not
the
employers
in
that
respect.
mr.
john
g.
kester
right,
and
i
should
say--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
trustees
and
the
program
itself.
it
is
sued
as
a
separate
entity,
and
it
has
been
found
in
some
of
the
cases
we
cite
in
our
briefs
in
similar
situations,
that
apprenticeship
programs
are
separate
entities.
they're
treated
as
such.
indeed,
the
liability
of
the
jatc,
i
should
point
out--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
hiring
hall?
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
apprentice
program
is
a
separate
entity.
it
does
stem
from
both
the
unions
and
the
employers
in
that
sense,
certainly,
but
the
liability
of
the
jatc,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
itself
is
very
unclear
in
the
opinion,
and
it
seems
as
if
it
is
almost
derivative
from
the
union's
discrimination
itself.
now,
i
started
to
say
with
respect
to
the
hiring
hall...
and
that
is
the
only
basis
on
which
discrimination
was
charged
against
my
client...
judge
higginbotham
in
the
district
court
referred
on
the
very
first
page
of
his
opinion
to
discrimination
in
what
he
called
local
542's
exclusive
hiring
hall.
on
page
2
he
says
local
542's
function
as
an
exclusive
hiring
hall,
and
he
goes
on
throughout
the
opinion.
the
notion
that
the
hiring
hall
is
anything
other
than
the
union
itself
is
something
that's
just
crept
into
this
case
at
a
very,
very
late
stage.
the
hiring
hall
is
the
union.
if
you
read
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
231,
141,
255,
the
words
hiring
hall
never
appear
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
say
the
union
shall
provide
the
work
force,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
on
the
question
of
control
which
came
up
a
little
while
ago,
i'd
like
to
say
a
couple
things
on
that,
too.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
has
several
decisions
under
section
1983...
and
this
of
course
is
section
1981...
under
1983
which
have
said
that
even
the
right
to
control
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
liability,
in
the
monell
case
and
the
rizzo
case,
for
examples,
and
what
the
district
court
said
in
its
opinion
really,
was
not,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
was
a
right
to
control.
the
pertinent
language
is
at
page
163
of
the
appendix
to
no.
280,
in
footnote
61,
and
at
that
point
what
the
district
court
did
was
it
equated
the
right
to
oppose
with
the
right
to
control,
and
i
think
those
are
two
different
things.
he
said
if
something
was...
it's
like
saying
if
you
now
somebody's
doing
something
wrong
and
you
may
have
a
cause
of
action
to
sue
them,
therefore
you
control
them.
well,
there's
many
a
slip
'twixt
the
cup
and
the
lip
in
lawsuits
and
any
other
kind
of
quasi-lawsuit
activity.
so
there
really
was
no
finding
of
control
here.
but
i
would
say
even
if
there
were
a
finding
of
a
right
to
control,
that
still
wouldn't
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
liability
under
1981.
i
cannot
believe
that
this
court
would
say
that
the
obligations
of
distantly
related
private
individuals
under
section
1981
are
greater
than
the
obligations
of
government
officials
under
section
1983.
now,
we
may
want
to
think
about
what
is
the
effect
of
this
decision,
whether
it
goes
one
way
or
the
other.
this
court
has
had
a
number
of
cases
before
it,
going
back
to
jones
against
myers
company
in
1968
involving
the
post-civil
rights...
or
the
post-civil
war
legislation,
and
i
would
say
first
of
all
the
country's
basic
antidiscrimination
law
is
not
section
1981;
it's
title
7.
and
title
7
has
a
very
carefully
thought
out
set
of
remedies,
set
of
procedures,
and
set
of
protections
for
persons
who
might
be
held
liable
under
it.
jones
against
myers
company
was
decided
four
years
after
title
7
was
on
the
books.
now,
1981,
which
dates
back
to
1866
and
1870,
is
a
law
guaranteeing
equal
rights
generally,
an
equal
right
to
testify,
to
enter
contracts,
equal
punishments,
taxes,
and
licenses,
and
if
there
is
in
its
legislative
history,
which
goes
on
for
hundreds
of
pages,
there's
not
one
hint
of
a
kind
of
vicarious
liability
such
as
proposed
in
this
case.
if
this
case
involves
an
exception,
if
you
would
regard
this
as
some
kind
of
a
loophole
in
civil
rights
liability,
i'd
have
to
say
any
requirement
of
intent,
then,
would
be
a
loophole,
and
yet
this
court
habitually
requires
intent
in
all
of
these
statutes.
and
this
court
in
monell
and
other
cases
has
consistently
rejected
thoughts
of
vicarious
liability.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
proposing
a
rather
extravagant
position
that
anyone
who
is
in
any
way
involved
with
a
discriminator
or,
in
the
case
of
my
client,
anyone
who
even
contracts
with
a
discriminator
becomes
liable
regardless
of
knowledge
for
any
kind
of
discrimination
that
occurs.
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
principle
limit
there
would
be
to
that
kind
of
liability.
it's
as
if
you
hire
somebody
to
paint
your
house
and
it
turns
out
that
the
house
painter
was
discriminating,
and
you're
held
liable
for
his
discrimination.
that's
not
what
was
intended
by
1981.
i
dont
think
that
the
draftsmen
in
1981
thought
about
this
at
all.
i
don't
think
any
of
this
is
what
they
had
in
mind.
and
several
members
of
the
court
have
already
expressed
reservations
about
drifting
steadily
into
more
and
more
extravagant
interpretations
of
the
post-civil
war
legislation.
i
think
perhaps
the
most
pertinent
citation
for
this
case
really
is
not
any
of
the
1981
cases
or
the
common
law
cases
or
the
scholars
that
we
cite
or
the
extensive
legislative
history.
i
think
perhaps
the
most
pertinent
citation
for
this
case
is
what
this
court
said
at
the
conclusion
of
the
little
snail
darter
case,
tennessee
valley
against
hill.
in
that
case
the
court
quoted
from
sir
thomas
more
as
he
is
thought
to
have
said
and
expressed
in
the
play
"a
man
for
all
seasons",
and
one
of
sir
thomas
more's
friends
expresses
impatience
with
the
law.
the
law
doesn't
do
everything
he
wants
it
to
do,
and
as
quoted
by
this
court,
sir
thomas
more
said,
what
would
you
do,
cut
a
great
road
through
the
law
to
get
after
the
devil?
and
when
the
last
law
was
down
and
the
devil
turned
around
on
you,
where
would
you
hide,
gofrey,
the
laws
all
being
flat?
this
is
a
case
where
impatience
could
lead
to
some
very
bad
results.
there's
certainly
nothing
attractive
for
victimized
minorities
in
this
country
if
limits
on
liability
are
ignored.
there
would
be
nothing
hopeful
for
the
naacp,
which
was
the
petitioner
in
the
previous
case,
in
a
legal
system
where
vicarious
absolute
liability
could
be
imposed
without
regard
to
knowledge
or
intent.
that's
not
consistent
with
the
law
of
a
century
ago,
and
it's
not
consistent
with
the
prevailing
sense
of
justice
today.
at
page
420
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
respondents
said
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
quote
their
position,
"the
notion
of
agency
and
control
are
smokescreens.
"
"our
theory
of
the
case
in
the
beginning,
and
it
is
the
one
found
by
judge
higginbotham,
is
one
of
strict
liability.
"
i
would
say
to
the
court,
i
don't
think
you
can
find
strict
liability
in
section
1981.
i
think
it
requires
intent.
i
think
it
requires
causation.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
imaginable
