unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
it
was
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
only
outside
of
the
agreement;
it
was
contrary
to
the
agreement's
provisions
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
agreement,
you
mean,
have
an
express
provision
that
in
the
operation
of
the
hiring
hall
there
should
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
race?
unknown
speaker
in
terms.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
suppose
respondents
rely
in
part
on
a
theory
that
1981
imposes
a
non-delegable
duty
on
the
employers,
and
secondly,
that
the
employers
had
an
obligation
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
to
hiring
in
a
nondiscriminatory
fashion.
would
you
address
those
theories?
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
didn't,
and
so
construed
wouldn't
involve
or
depend
on
any
kind
of
intent
to
discriminate.
unknown
speaker
well,
though,
is
that
to
suggest
that
if
we
were
to
hold
that
there
was
a
non-delegable
duty
under
1981,
that
is
still
not
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
because--
unknown
speaker
--because
there
has
to
be
affirmative
proof
of
intention?
unknown
speaker
they
are
just
inconsistent,
aren't
they?
you...
intent
would
be
irrelevant
if
there
is
a
non-delegable
duty.
well,
that
is
xx
what
he
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
is
not
a
non-delegable
duty.
that's
what
i
would
think.
but
you
go
ahead
and
argue
the
way
you--
unknown
speaker
--certainly.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcaleese,
i
think
i'm
having
the
same
difficulty
justice
white
was.
i
understand
the
concept
of
non-delegable
duty
to
be
basically
borrowed
from
tort
law--
unknown
speaker
--where,
as
i
had
understood
it,
it
relieves
the
plaintiff
from
having
to
show
negligence
on
the
part
of
one
defendant
because
you
say
he
didn't
have
to
be
negligence.
if
another
defendant
was,
then
his
conduct
was
a
non-delegable
duty.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
it
wouldn't
be
a
non-delegable
duty.
but
if
you,
if
you
say
that
you
have
to
have
an
intent
to
discriminate,
why
you
would
just,
anytime
there
is
not
an
intent
to
discriminate,
non-delegable
duty
or
not,
there
is
no
liability.
unknown
speaker
which
is...
which
in
one
sense
is
a
failure
to
enforce.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
enforce,
now,
but
your
position--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
care
whether
you
had
knowledge
or
not.
you
didn't
enforce
it.
now--
unknown
speaker
--now,
your
position
is
that
that
just
is
not
a
basis
for
liability.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcaleese--
unknown
speaker
--not
that
it's
in
this
case,
but
what
would
your
idea
be
of
how
it
could
be
proved
that
a
company
did
something
with
an
intent
to
discriminate?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
is
it
that
you
do
that
shows
you
have
an
intent
to
discriminate?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
don't
file
an
affidavit
saying
that,
you
don't
write
a
letter
saying
it.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn't
have
to
make
an
affidavit.
he
just
has
to...
i
mean,
i
am
wondering
how
you
show
intent--
unknown
speaker
--because
in
this
day
and
age
you
don't
have
people
going
around
saying
such
things,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
may
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
is
that
you
say
it.
how
is
it
another
way?
unknown
speaker
that
would
show
it.
anything
else?
i
mean,
for
example,
if
this
company,
in
your
case,
the
glasgow
case,
if
the
union
periodically,
without
exception,
referred
hottentots
to
you,
would
you
suspect
that
there
was
something
wrong?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
were
all
american
indians
in
east
pennsylvania,
would
that--
unknown
speaker
--would
that
look
to
you
like
something
was
going
on?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
even
look
into
it?
unknown
speaker
this
was
a
hypothetical.
it
wasn't
this
case
because
i
don't
think
you
have
any
hottentots
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
had
the...
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
you
had
the...
you
had
a
contractual
right
to
prevent
the
union
from
racially
discriminating.
unknown
speaker
you
just
said
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
promised
not
to
discriminate.
they
promised
you
not
to
discriminate.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
don't
make
the
generality
that
you
had
no
right
to
oversee
their...
you
certainly
had
a
right
to
look
around
and
if
you
thought
they
were
breaching
the
contract
you
could
have
sued
them.
unknown
speaker
under
301,
under
301.
so
you
had
a
right
to
do
something
to
them.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
most
of
those
rights
do
rest
in
contract,
by
the
way.
unknown
speaker
like
employer
and
employee,
they
usually
rest
in
contract.
unknown
speaker
after
all,
the...
yes.
well,
of
course,
the
union's
representing
the
employer's
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
a
unit
that
has
made
a
promise
to
the
employer
that
it
now
is
claimed
is
being
broken,
or
was
broken,
and
it
has
been...
was
found
that
it
was
broken.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
did
you
say
that
your
clients
were
or
were
not
signatories
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
associations,
they
undertook
no
obligations?
unknown
speaker
for
the
employer,
members
of
the
associations?
unknown
speaker
did
they
negotiate
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
abandon
all
of
the...
all
of
the
members
of
the
association
and
still
win.
you
could
say
that
are
entitled
to
be
free
of
this
judgment,
or
to
be
free
of
any
judgment
even
if
the
members
of
the
association,
each
of
them
is
liable,
i
suppose,
because
you...
they
may
have
owed
a
duty,
but
you
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
wouldn't,
but
you
could--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
don't
say
that
if
they
lose
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
once
again,
once
the
contract
is
signed,
you
and
the
employer
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
until
the
next
contract?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
grievance
procedures
or
anything.
that's
the
individual
employer,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
mean.
so
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
represent
the
employers
in
that
respect.
unknown
speaker
that's
all
you
needed
to
say.
you
don't
need
to...
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
what
about
the
apprentice
program,
the
jtac,
do
you
call
it?
unknown
speaker
do
the
associations
have
anything
to
do
with
that
by
way
of
appointing
the
trustees
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
employers?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
completely
draw
a
barrier
between
both
the
associations
and
the
employers
on
the
one
side,
and
whatever
the
apprentice
program
may
have
practiced
by
way
of
discrimination
on
the
other.
unknown
speaker
and
who
would
be
liable
for
discrimination
there,
the
trustees?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
is
a
joint
enterprise
with
the
union,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes...
no,
the
apprentice
program.
unknown
speaker
separate
from
the
union?
unknown
speaker
well,
voluntarily
after
a
couple
of
strikes,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
get
you
off
the
track
of
answering
the
question
about
the
union
being
separate
from
the
hiring
hall.
unknown
speaker
the
hiring
hall
isn't
a
separate
juridical
entity,
is
it,
like
a
corporation
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
incorporated?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
just
a
system
of
job
referral
that's
operated
by
the
union?
unknown
speaker
well,
wait
a
minute.
that
was
negotiated,
wasn't
it?
did
the
management
just
tell
the
union,
look,
you
take
over,
or
was
it
negotiated?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
for
the
union
hall?
unknown
speaker
not
to
the
extent.
who
pays
the
bills?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
much
cash,
green
money
does
the
employer
put
into
the
union
hall?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
the
union
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
admit
it,
that
the
union
controls
the
union
hall?
unknown
speaker
the
hiring
hall.
unknown
speaker
you
do,
now?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
goodman,
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
i'm...
you
would
think
you
were
going
to
end
up
saying
you
didn't
have
to
find
that
there
was
any
vicarious
liability
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
judge
thought
he
had
to
to
reach
that
issue,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
don't
you
have
to
defend
that?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
sure
what
you've
said
is
very
relevant
to
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
was,
it's
undisputed
it
was
violated
by
the
employers?
unknown
speaker
but
that
requires
some
discussion
of
the
intent
element,
doesn't
it,
unless
you
say
there
is
no
intent
element.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
made
the
statement
just
a
moment
ago
that
it
is
undisputed
that
the
employers
violated
section
1981,
and
i
thought
it
was
disputed
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
case
is
over
then.
we
don't
have
to
sit
here
arguing
it.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
judge
had...
he
had
to
find
vicarious
liability
because
he
couldn't
find
that
the
employers
were
violating
it
themselves.
unknown
speaker
that
he
had
to
impute
somebody
else's
liability
to
them.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
different
thing
than
saying
it's
undisputed
that
the
employers
violated
1981,
which
is
the
way
you
put
it
a
moment
ago.
unknown
speaker
is
that
really
a
fair
argument?
i
mean,
if
you
talk
about
the
foreman,
don't
you
assume
that
the
employer
knows
what
its...
i
mean,
that
the
knowledge
of
the
agent
is
imputed
as
a
principle.
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
you
on
another
point.
i'm
worried
about
this
association
that
did
nothing
but
help
draw
up
this
contract,
mediation,
the
agreement,
a
labor
agreement.
unknown
speaker
they
were
held
vicariously
liable?
unknown
speaker
i'm
interested
in
my
own
profession.
are
the
lawyers
that
negotiate
also
liable?
unknown
speaker
and
the
difference
is?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
story
was
that
they
put
into
the
contract
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
have
you
answered
justice
marshall's
question?
does
that
argument
respond
to
his
concern
about
the
lawyer
or
the
collective
bargaining
agent?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
the
association?
unknown
speaker
but
the
lawyer
is
an
agent
of
his
client.
unknown
speaker
well,
say
they
had
hired
a
lawyer
instead
of
a
trade
association
to
negotiate
their
contract.
unknown
speaker
then
why...
i
don't
understand.
why
is
that
different?
unknown
speaker
so
do
lawyers,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
say
they
put
in
the
contract,
instead
of
in
'71
they
put
it
in
in
'61
and
'63,
there
should
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
race.
your
case
is
still
the
same
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goodman,
does
that
suggest
that
even,
for
example,
if
the
employers,
if
we
were
to
say
they
can't
be
held
liable,
that
is
as
being
liable
for
discrimination
generally...
they
are
involved
in
the
ajct
program,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
could
they
be
held
liable,
even
though
not
otherwise,
for
discrimination
in
that
program
as
to
training?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
segregation
of
the
two
in
the
findings
below?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
separate
determinations
of
damages?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
allocate
the
liability
for
costs
up
to
date,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
they
did
allocate
a
separate
part
to
the
training
program?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
union's?
unknown
speaker
and
the--
unknown
speaker
--was
the
training
program
considered
a
separate
entity
in
this
allocation
of
costs?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goodman,
excuse
me.
if
you
prevail,
there's
still
the
matter
of
damages
to
be
determined?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
on
this.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
all
of
your
position.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
we
disagreed
with
the
district
court
and
with
you
with
respect
to
non-delegable
duty,
intent,
and
that
we
just
held
that
the
employer...
let's
say
we
said
1981
requires
an
intentional
discrimination,
the
employers
had
no
intentional
discrimination,
therefore
they're
not
liable
under
1981.
could
you
still
reach
them
as
part
of
the
remedy?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
completely
independent
ground
for
saying
the
injunctive
part
of
the
decision
below
would
nevertheless
run
against
the
employers,
even
if
they
weren't
liable
for
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
the
rationale
of
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
so
wouldn't
we
have
to
remand
before
we
could
ever...
wouldn't
we
have
to
have
the
district
court
do
his
remedy
over
if
we
didn't
agree
with
his
theory
of
liability?
unknown
speaker
well,
given
the
district
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
contractors
and
no
reason
to
know,
on
your
theory
that
they
could
be
held
in
the
case
by
reason
of
the
necessity
for
formulating
a
remedy,
would
it
be
proper
to
assess
the
costs
of
the
remedy
in
part
against
the
contractors?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
district
court
would
have
exercised
its
discretion
in
this
manner
had
it
decided
that
1981
required
intent
and
that
its
theory
of
vicarious
liability
or
non-delegable
duty
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
goodman,
i
didn't
know
that
you
could
just...
say
you
brought
a
suit
against
your
employer
and
say,
you
have
not
been
hiring
minorities
in
suitable
numbers.
and
the
employer
says,
well,
i
guess
that's
right;
and
the
judge
says,
yeah,
that's
right,
so
i'm
going
to
order
you
to
hire
them.
and
the
employer
says,
well,
don't
you
have
to
find
i've
violated
the
act
first?
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i
guess
not,
no;
i'm
just
going
to
order
you
to
hire
them.
don't
you
have
to
have...
isn't
a
predicate
for
this
kind
of
relief
some
violation
of
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
remedy.
how
can
you
order
the
employer
to
restructure
his
work
force
by
hiring
quotas
without
finding
some
violation
of
the
act
by
the
employer,
not
somebody
else?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose
they
were
influenced
in
that
request
by
the
fact
that
that
relieved
them
of
trying
to
persuade
the
union
to
do
something?
unknown
speaker
it
would
take
the
pistol,
the
union's
pistol
away
from
their
heads,
would
it
not,
the
hiring
hall?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
injunctive
remedy?
unknown
speaker
let's
talk
about
the
injunctive
remedy.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
talk
about
the
injunctive
remedy
in
this
case.
do
you
say
that
the
injunction
should
not
have
run
against
the
employers
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
members?
is
anybody
going
to
speak
for
the
contractors?
how
about
the
injunction
against
the
contractors?
unknown
speaker
well,
should
there
have
been
any
injunctive
relief
against
the
contractors?
unknown
speaker
we
know
about
the
zipes
case.
unknown
speaker
we
know
about
the
zipes
case.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10
o'clock.
