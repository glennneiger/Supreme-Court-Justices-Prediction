mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
that's
all
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
courts
below
stretched
the
reach
of
the
contract
portion
of
section
1981
of
title
42
to
impose
liability
for
racial
discrimination
on
a
private
business
organization
and
three
private
trade
associations
who
themselves
did
not
practice
discrimination,
did
not
have
any
intent
to
discriminate,
did
not
conspire
to
discriminate,
and
neither
knew
nor
had
reason
to
know
that
the
discrimination
for
which
they
were
held
liable
was
being
practiced.
thus,
the
general
question
presented
hereby
is
whether
section
1981
does
indeed
reach
so
far.
the
case
began
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
in
1971
when
12
blacks
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
sued,
among
others,
a
construction
union,
a
construction
contractor,
and
three
contractor
associations
for
racial
discrimination
under,
among
other
statutes,
section
1981.
the
focus
of
the
complaint
was
the
union's
exclusive
referral
system
which
was
found
by
the
trial
court
and
not
challenged,
was
facially
neutral.
the
action
was
certified
as
a
class
action
on
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant's
sides,
the
construction
contractor,
glasgow,
being
the
class
representative
for
approximately
1500
other
contractors,
and
the
associations
being
the
class
representatives
for
other
associations.
this
afternoon
i
will
argue
on
behalf
of
glasgow,
and
mr.
kester
on
behalf
of
the
associations.
the
case
was
bifurcated
for
trial
into
a
liability
phase
and
a
damage
phase.
the
former
has
been
completed.
the
latter
essentially
has
not
started.
following
trial,
the
trial
court
imposed
liability
under
section
1981
on
the
union,
on
glasgow,
and
on
the
three
associations,
and
thus
on
the
members
of
the
defendant
classes
that
these
defendants
represented.
it
issued
an
extensive
injunction
against
all
defendants
and
class
members,
which
included
hiring
quotas
and
training
programs.
stated
in
a
somewhat
simplified
fashion,
the
trial
court's
decision
under
section
1981
respecting
glasgow
was
that
the
union,
defendant
union
intentionally
discriminated
against
minorities
in
the
operation
of
its
referral
system,
and
solely
because
glasgow,
acting
pursuant
to
a
lawful
contractual
duty,
notified
the
union
of
its
need
for
workmen,
and
thereafter
hired
persons
referred
by
the
union,
it,
too,
was
enveloped
within
the
section
1981
net.
i
might
again
add
that
the
trial
court
found...
and
those
findings
are
unchallenged...
that
glasgow
itself
did
not
discriminate,
did
not
intend
to
discriminate,
did
not
conspire
to
discriminate,
and
neither
knew
nor
had
reason
to
know
that
the
union
was
practicing
discrimination.
the
third
circuit
en
banc
divided
equally,
thereby
affirming,
and
did
not
seek...
and
did
not
issue
any
opinion.
the
union
did
not
seek
review
by
this
court.
some
background
facts
are
helpful.
in
1961
glasgow,
a
philadelphia
unionized
excavating
contractor,
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
operating
engineers
local
union
which
represented
operating
engineers
employed
by
glasgow.
operating
engineers
run
heavy
construction
equipment,
cranes,
bulldozers
and
the
like.
up
until
then,
glasgow
was
free
to
obtain
operating
engineers
from
any
available
source.
he
could
hire
off
the
street.
glasgow's
labor
agreement
with
the
engineers
was
scheduled
to
expire
around
mid-1961.
in
the
negotiations
that
year
for
a
new
labor
agreement
glasgow
was
represented
by
one
of
the
contractor
associations
which
is
a
petitioner
here.
glasgow
was
participating
in
these
negotiations
pursuant
to
its
legal
duty
under
federal
law
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
engineers
union.
glasgow
was
faced
in
these
negotiations
with
a
demand
by
the
union
for
an
agreement
to
obtain
operating
engineers
for
employment
from
no
other
source
except
the
union's
referral
system.
as
presented
by
the
union
in
the
negotiations
and
as
found
by
the
courts
below
and
unchallenged
here,
the
union's
referral
system
was
racially
neutral.
glasgow
and
the
other
employers
who
were
involved
in
that
particular
negotiation
wanted
no
part
of
this
provision,
and
accordingly
gave
an
outright
rejection
to
this
union
demand.
an
impasse
in
bargaining
ensued,
and
because
the
demand
was
and
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
under
federal
law,
the
union,
with
impunity,
struck
glasgow
and
the
other
employers
to
force
their
agreement
to
the
union's
referral
system.
after
a
ten
week
strike
which
the
trial
court
called
destructive,
glasgow
and
the
others
capitulated
to
the
union
and
thereupon
agreed
to
notify
the
union
of
the
need
for
workmen
so
that
referrals
could
be
made
by
the
union
to
them.
in
1963
an
attempt
was
made
by
glasgow
and
other
contractors
to
rid
themselves
of
the
referral
provision
but
a
strike,
another
strike,
lengthy
strike
rendered
this
unsuccessful.
the
duty
to
notify
the
union
of
a
need
for
workmen
and
to
consider
referrals
for
employment
has
been
a
part
of
all
labor
agreements
between
glasgow
and
the
engineers
union
since
then.
the
union's
referral
system
places
engineers
in
groups
upon
length
of
service
and
aligns
and
refers
them
on
a
first
in-first
out
basis.
throughout
the
entire
period
covered
by
this
case,
the
registration,
the
grouping
within
this
referral
system,
the
aligning
within
the
groups,
and
indeed,
the
referrals
were
performed
solely
and
exclusively
by
employees
of
the
union.
as
contractually
and
indeed
legally
obligated
to
do,
glasgow
used
the
system
by
notifying
the
union
of
its
need
and
then
hiring
referrals
therefrom.
the
district
court
specifically
determined
that
the
employees
of
the
union
who,
without
the
knowledge
or
any
reason
to
know
by
glasgow
that
these
employees
who
registered,
grouped,
aligned
and
referred
engineers,
failed
to
do
so
in
accordance
with
the
rules
governing
the
system.
in
the
words
of
the
trial
court,
the
union
procedures
in
general
constituted
a
motley
fabric
of
arbitrary
departure
from
the
rules.
instead,
and
in
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
glasgow,
those
employees
of
the
union
registered,
grouped,
aligned
and/or
referred
engineers
in
an
intentionally
racially
discriminatory
fashion.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
justice
rehnquist,
contains
an
outline
of
how
the
system
is
constructed,
the
union's
referral
system,
and
specifies,
as
it
were,
the
rules
for
the
running
of
that
system,
and
when
the
union,
instead
of
complying
with
those
rules,
but
instead
engaging
in
this
conduct,
as
it
were,
outside
the
agreement,
engaged
in
a
breach
of
the
agreement.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
contrary.
it
was
a
direct
breach
of
the
agreement.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
it
did
commencing
in
1971.
that
was
incorporated
into
the
agreement.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
with
respect
to
the
second
question
that
you
asked,
treating
that
first,
they
do
intend...
indeed
contend
that
we
had
an
obligation
to
enforce,
but
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
unchallenged
findings
that
glasgow,
and
indeed,
other
contractors,
neither
knew
nor
had
reason
to
know
that
the
union
was
practicing
discrimination,
was,
as
justice
rehnquist
said,
its
conduct
was
contrary
to
the
agreement.
now,
with
respect
to
your
first
question,
there
is
a
contention
indeed
that
1981
imposes
a
non-delegable
duty.
i
think
that
question
can
be
approached
analytically
in
two
ways.
i
think
first,
going
directly
to
the
issue,
does
it
contain
a
non-delegable
duty,
i
think
that
in
turn
depends
upon
the
construction
of
section
1981.
the
non-delegable
duty
spoken
of
by
the
trial
court
in
its
lengthy
opinion
was
a
duty
stemming
from
1981
imposed
on
glasgow
under
these
circumstances
to
prevent
the
discrimination
being
practiced
by
the
union.
in
a
sense,
it
was
a
strict
liability
standard
that
was
imposed
on
glasgow--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--it
would
not
indeed
it
would
not
indeed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
white--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--that...
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
that
is
not--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--the
end
of
the
case--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--indeed,
justice
brennan--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--no,
it
wouldn't,
no,
it
wouldn't,
justice
white.
i
would
say
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
if
the
non-delegable
duty
is
duty
to
prevent
discrimination,
as
the
trial
court
said
in
its
opinion,
then
it
seems
that
if
you
were
to
rule
in
this
case
that
intent
is
a
part
of
1981,
that
there
would
have
to
be
proof
that
the
failure,
the
failure
to
prevent
discrimination
was
itself
racially
motivated.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
what
i
was
saying,
in
response
to,
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
the
non-delegable
duty,
you
can
approach
this
case
the
other
way.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
looking
at
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
not
unlike
justice
stevens
did
in
the
case
last
term,
the
city
of
memphis
v.
green
where
you
can
analyze
the
specific
conduct
that
is
challenged
here.
and
what
is
that
conduct?
the
conduct
by
glasgow
that
has
been...
that
liability
was
based
upon
is
that
glasgow,
pursuant
to
a
contractual
obligation
it
had,
notified
the
union
of
xx
need
for
workmen
and
then
considered
and
indeed
did
employ
the
persons
referred
by
the
union.
that
is
the
challenged
conduct.
now
the
question
is,
looking
at
1981,
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history,
is
that
the
kind
of
conduct
which
is
violative
of
1981?
that
is
another
way
to
analyze
the
matter
of
what
are
the
duties
stemming
from
1981,
and
that
is
to
say
that
whatever
the
duties
are
that
1981
imposes,
duties
separate
and
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
need
for
a
discriminatory
motive,
that
whatever
they
are,
this
challenged
conduct
did
not
fall
within
the
ambit
of
coverage
of
section
1981.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
mm-hmm.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i
think
that
the
notion
of
non-delegable
duty
is
the
sense
that
there
are
some
activities
beyond
the
physical
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
defendant
which
liability
is
imposed
on
the
defendant
for
that
conduct,
and
the
reason
why
it
is
is
not
on
any
vicarious
theory
but
instead
that
the
defendant
owes
a
direct
duty
to
the
plaintiff,
and
it
would
seem
that
using
the
non-delegable
duty
type
theory
in
the
context
of
1981
that
this
court
would
have
to
interpret,
construe
section
1981
as
imposing
an
obligation
on
glasgow
under
these
circumstances
to
prevent
the
discrimination
which
was
practiced
by
the
union
employees.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
and
if
such
a
construction
is
not
given
to
the
statute,
then
under
those
circumstances,
the
statute
does
not
reach
the
glasgow
conduct.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i
mean,
this
case...
you
are
entirely
correct,
justice
white.
i
think
this
case
can
be
looked
at
in
two
ways.
number
one,
you
can
look
at
the
statute
and
say
does
the
statute
prohibit
the
conduct,
the
specific
conduct
that
glasgow
engaged
in
here,
and
you
can
interpret
the
statute
to
say--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--didn't
enforce
the
agreement?
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
well,
but
we
had
no
knowledge
or
reason
to
know--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
as
i
say,
it
can
be
approached
in
one
of
two
ways.
you
can
do
the
statutory
construction
matter
and
see
if
you
catch
the
conduct,
or
you
can
approach
the
case
on
the
sole
ground
that
if
1981
requires
a
proof
of
intent,
then
the
unchallenged
finding
by
the
trial
court--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--that
there
was
no
intent
is
sufficient
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i
think
that
the
cases
are
legion,
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--i
would
think
that
one
way
would
be
if
the
respondents
in
this
case
brought
an
action
against
a
single
employer,
let's
take
for
example
glasgow,
and
they
proved
that
an
operating
engineer
presented
himself
for
employment
by
glasgow
and
glasgow
said
i
refuse
to
hire
you
on
the
grounds
that
you
are
a
minority.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
well,
i
mean--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--that
may
be
correct,
your
honor
but--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--but
to
show
intentional
discrimination,
there
are
a
variety
of
evidential
tools.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
well,
i
think
certainly
the
courts
have
sanctioned
the
use
of
statistical
evidence
to
form
the
basis
for
inferences
of
intentional
discrimination
under
some
circumstances.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
would
i
suspect?
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
and
just
in
the
context
of
this--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--not
necessarily
because
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
not
only
was
glasgow
using
this
particular
referral
system,
but
there
were
1500
or
more
other
contractors
that
were
using
it,
and
it
could
happen,
with
a
given
contractor
or
contractors
where--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
in
this
particular
case,
following
18
months
of
trial
and
evidence
on
these
various
questions,
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
not
only
no
knowledge,
but
indeed,
also
no
reason
to
know,
which
is
i
think
the
area
that
you
are
suggesting.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
just
briefly,
in
closing
here,
it
is
our
position
that
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
rule
that
intent
is
necessary
for
a
violation
of
section
1981,
and
the
very
brief
basis
of
that
is
the
close
relationship
between
section
1981
and
the
14th
amendment
and
its
requirements
as
this
court
has
spelled
out
in
the
case
of
washington
v.
davis.
with
respect
to
the
decision
by
the
lower
court,
going
away
specifically
from
what
we
might
call
a
direct
violation
of
section
1981
and
going
to
the
matter
of
respondeat
superior,
i
think
that
is
very,
very
easily
disposed
of.
there
certainly
is
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
respondeat
superior
can
be
used
with
1981,
and
even
if
so,
what
the
extent
of
that
would
be
because
of
the
personalized
nature
of
the
statute,
1981.
but
beyond
that,
it
doesn't
seem
in
this
case
that
a
decision
has
to
be
made
on
that
simply
because
it
is
so
clear
that
there
was
no
right
to
control,
right
to
supervise
the
union
employees
who
practiced
the
discrimination
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
well,
if
you
mean
that--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--there
was
an
antidiscrimination
clause
in
their
agreement--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--but
that
is
not
enough
under
the
law
governing
respondeat
superior...
and
i
refer
the
court
to--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--without
question,
file
a
grievance
under
the--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--a
right
in
that
sense,
but
when
i
speak
of
a
right
to
control
or
a
right
to
supervise,
i
speak
of
that
as
it
is
within
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--as
this
court
has
spoken
to
in
the
loeb
case
and
the
orleans
case
in
'73
and
'76.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
now,
you...
is--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--and
if
the
court
were
to
review
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
were
operative
throughout
the
period,
it
would
find
that
nowhere
in
those
agreements
is
there
any
right
to
control.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
and
stands
as
an
autonomous
entity
with
a
fiduciary
duty
to
those
employees
and
no
duty
whatever,
as
it
were,
to
the
employer.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
it
is
not
that
nature
of
fact
pattern
which
satisfies
the
right
to
control
that
is
necessary
to
trigger
effectively
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior.
it's
a
right
physically
to
supervise
the
union
employees
in
this
case
who
practiced
the
discrimination
in
violation
of
section
1981.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
that
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court:
we
don't
dispute
that
minorities
have
the
same
right
to
work
as
whites.
the
question
is
whether
my
clients
should
be
required
to
pay
money
because
the
union
discriminated.
there
was
reference
made
in
the
argument--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--the
injunctive
remedy
is...
well,
let's
talk
about
the
zipes
case,
which
is--
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
--okay.
well,
the
zipes
case
was
an
injunctive
remedy.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
the
nature
of
the
injunction
certainly
shouldn't
have
run
against
the
associations,
because
all
my
client
is
required
to
do
in
that
injunction
is
pay
money.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i
think
the
injunction
against
the
contractors
went
far
beyond
what
it
should
too,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
should
have
been,
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
showing
of
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
contractors.
you
could
have
gotten
complete
relief
by
an
injunction
against
the
union
in
this
case,
as
near
as
i
can
tell.
it's
not
the
zipes
case,
because
in
the
zipes
case,
as
the
court
knows,
it
was
necessary
to
interfere
with
the
union's
seniority
system
in
order
to
grant
the
relief.
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
mcaleese,
jr.
i
know
you
know
about
the
zipes
case.
with
respect
to
the
philadelphia
plan,
that
involved
a
different
part
of
the
case
that
isn't
on
appeal
before
this
court.
it
was
a
claim
under
1985(3).
the
only
basis
for
liability
in
this
case
was
signing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
that's
clear
in
the
record
at
pages
102...
106,
rather,
and
142
of
the
opinion.
with
respect
to
the
jatc,
there
were
no
findings
at
all
in
the
court
below
that
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
basis
for
liability.
the
basis
for
liability
is
clear,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
get
there
under
1981.
