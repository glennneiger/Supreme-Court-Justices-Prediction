mr.
harold
i.
goodman
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
few
cases
i
think
have
reached
this
court
with
the
intensity
and
magnitude
of
racial
discrimination
that
this
one
does.
blacks
and
other
minorities
did
not
work
for
the
contractors
as
a
class
solely
because
of
intentional
racial
discrimination.
that
is
clear
and
it
is
undisputed.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
sole
reason
that
that
happened
was
that
general
building
contractors
association
and
all
the
other
associations
on
behalf
of
their
members
and
an
entire
industry
created
by
contract
an
exclusive
hiring
hall
with
local
542.
under
that
hiring
hall,
each
employer
had
to
rely
on
the
union
for
workers.
it
had
no
choice.
not
one
of
my
clients
could
walk
up
to
glasgow
and
say
i
am
skilled.
i've
operated
bulldozers.
i
want
to
work
for
you.
my
clients
had
to
go
through
the
union.
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
assume
that
the
union,
as
such,
is
somehow
distinct
from
the
employers
in
this
respect
because
the
hiring
hall
is
separate.
it
was
set
up
by
the
associations.
the
hiring
hall
was
administered
by
the
union,
and
that
is
clear.
but
the
hiring
hall
was
a
separate
entity.
and
what
that
entity
did
was
as
follows.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
it
was
administered
by
the
union,
but
it
is
separate
from
the
union.
that
is
to
say,
justice
rehnquist,
in
setting
up
a
hiring
hall
as
such,
the
associations
by
collective
bargaining
agreement
sat
across
from
local
542
and
decided
voluntarily
to
create
an
entity,
a
hiring
hall,
as
the
mechanism
for
the
entry--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--well,
the
evidence
on
the
strikes
is
less
than
clear.
certainly
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record,
none
whatsoever,
that
there
was
any
strike
since
1963,
some
18
years
ago,
and
certainly
no
one
has
ever
suggested
and
no
one
has
cited
to
any
cases
that
would
suggest
that
coercion
or
duress
is
the
basis
for
racial
discrimination.
the
fourth
circuit
has
made
that
clear
when
it
said
in
the
robinson
case
the
rights
guaranteed
by
section
1981
cannot
be
bargained
away,
cannot
be
bargained
away
by
employers
or
by
unions.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
it
is
a
critical
point,
though,
because
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
union
runs
the
hiring
hall,
no
doubt
about
it,
by
a
set
of
rules
by--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--it
is
in
this
instance,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
it
isn't
a
corporate
entity.
but
it
didn't
exist
and
couldn't
exist
without
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
it
is
a
system
of
job
referral,
but
it's
also
a
system
of
entry
because
the
only
way
you
can
enter
the
union
is
if
the
union
made
the
decision
to
admit
people,
and
the
employers,
justice
rehnquist,
are
the
ones
who
gave
the
union
that
right.
in
the
end
they
could
have
chosen
to
use
a
foreman
or
their
own
personnel
office,
but
they
did
choose
and
continued
to
do
so
over
the
last
20
years
to
rely
on
this
particular
unit,
and
here
are
the
consequences
of
that.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
well,
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
when
we
examine
this
particular
record
and
examine
each
collective
bargaining
agreement,
justice
marshall,
which
was
negotiated
every
single
year,
i
think
it
was
negotiated.
it
is
certainly
true
at
the
outset,
in
1961,
shortly
after
landrum-griffin
made
hiring
halls
legal,
that
the
employers
took
a
strike.
we
don't
deny
that,
and
we
don't
deny
the
fact
that
two
years
later
in
'63
they
took
a
strike.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
the
union
hall
is
paid
for,
to
the
extent
that...
is
actually
funded--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--well,
the
bills
are
paid
for
by
the
union
to
the
extent
that
it's
its
employees,
but
the
employers
check
off
dues,
check
off
funds
into
a
health
and
welfare
program.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
well,
the
employers
don't
put
any
money
into
the
union.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
well,
we
do.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
we
do,
we
do,
concede
that.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
absolutely.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
absolutely.
the
question
in
this
case,
though,
is
the
magnitude
of
the
discrimination
as
it
affected
the
employers.
now,
in
that
particular
instance
it
is
clear
that
1500
employers
relied
on
local
542,
not
on
their
foremen,
not
on
employment
agencies,
and
the
result
of
that
were
that
hundreds
of
minorities,
solely
because
of
their
race,
were
denied
jobs
with
the
employers
and
were
precluded
from
earning
a
living.
it
is
clear
that
1036
employers
out
of
1500
never
employed
a
minority
operating
engineer.
why?
because
they
chose
to
rely
on
local
542.
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
financial
cost
to
minorities
approximately
1
million
hours
a
year
in
lost
work,
multiplied
by
the
wages
over
a
15
year
limitation
period,
that
would
be
in
excess
of
$100
million
solely
because
of
a
persons
race.
now,
the
hiring
hall
as
such
is
not
the
only
entity
in
this
matter,
and
it
is
not
the
only
area
in
which
our
opponents
agree
that
there
was
racial
discrimination.
they
set
up,
as
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
an
apprenticeship
program
which
is
called
the
joint
apprenticeship
program.
three
trustees
were
chosen
by
the
associations
and
three
by
the
union.
it
is
exhibit
p-254.
it
says
the
entrustees
for
the
employers
shall
represent
the
employers
and
their
interests,
and
the
same
for
the
union
trustees.
the
joint
apprenticeship
program
engaged
in
intentional
discrimination,
denying
entry
and
jobs
to
minorities.
and
again,
that
is
undisputed,
it
is
intentional,
and
it
is
unchallenged.
but
more
than
any
other
fact
in
this
case,
there
is
one
other
joint
one
that
has
not
been
mentioned,
and
that
is
the
history
of
the
philadelphia
plan.
judge
higginbotham
devoted
a
considerable
amount
of
his
findings
to
that
issue.
now,
mr.
kester
called
his
client
the
forgotten
party.
i
don't
think
judge
higginbotham
forgot
about
them.
he
described
his
clients,
mr.
kester's,
and
he
said
it
in
these
words:
the
conduct
of
the
associations,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
affirmative
action
program
which
substituted
for
the
philadelphia
plan,
demonstrated
a
reckless
disregard
for
equal
employment
opportunity
for
minorities.
the
federal
government,
after
years
of
experience,
and
i
must
say
as
the
court
took
judicial
notice
in
weber
of
the
historical
discrimination
against
minorities
in
the
construction
industry,
the
federal
government
decided
on
a
common
sense
approach,
namely,
the
employers
pay
the
wages,
the
employers
put
people
to
work.
and
so
as
a
result
they
put
the
operating
engineers
as
a
craft,
not
the
union,
the
craft,
the
employers,
under
the
coverage
of
the
philadelphia
plan.
all
the
employers
had
to
do
in
the
associations
was
comply
with
federal
law.
but
as
judge
higginbotham--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--no,
no
we're
not,
and
i
only--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--he
did,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir,
and
we
do.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
first
of
all,
just
preliminarily--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--preliminarily,
justice
powell,
on
the
issue,
on
the
issue
of
vicarious
liability,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
judge
higginbotham,
i
think
consistent
with
the
court's
decision
in
teamsters,
bifurcated
this
case,
and
the
trial
took
a
year
and
a
half
to
complete.
so
at
stage
one
he
dealt
just
with
liability
and
with
issues
related
to
injunctive
relief.
he
did
not
make
any
individualized
findings
against
glasgow.
he
didn't
make
any
individualized
findings
in
favor
of,
against
or
in
favor
of
any
individual
member
of
the
plaintiff
class.
what
he
found
was
that
most
if
not
all
of
the
employers
did
know
about
the
discrimination,
but
as
a
class,
viewed
only
as
a
class,
they
did
not.
he
then
concluded
that
1981
does
in
fact
have
a
vicarious
liability
component.
in
doing
that
he
drew
on
essentially
two
theories,
one,
the
non-delegable
duty,
and
two,
essentially
one
of
agency
or
joint
enterprise.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first,
the
non-delegable
duty,
it
is
clear,
and
it
is
here
undisputed,
that
1981
was
violated,
and
it
was
violated
by
the
employers.
by
its
clear
terms
it
says
all
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir,
because
they
did
not
provide
work
as
operating
engineers
to
minorities.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
no.
judge
higenbothem
found,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
union
engaged
in
intentional
racial
discrimination.
he
also
found
that
the
apprenticeship
program
engaged
in
intentional
racial
discrimination.
he
then
posed
this
question:
can
that
intentional
discrimination
be
imputed
to
the
employers
and
the
associations?
he
answered
that
question
affirmatively.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
don't
believe
so.
first
of
all,
when
i
made
that
statement
i
meant--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--we
would
be
glad
to
submit
if
that
were
the
case.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
as
a...
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
he
did
do
that.
my
point
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
was
that
it
is
undisputed
that
minorities
as
a
class
did
not
have
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
with
the
employers
as
did
whites,
and
the
result
of
that
was
a
substantial
loss
of
work
and
a
substantial
loss
of
wages.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
what
i
meant...
that
is
correct.
what
i
meant
was
in
that
respect,
that
the
finding
in
that
respect
was
vicarious,
and
it's
to
that
point
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
now.
section
1981,
in
our
judgment,
does
create
non-delegable
duties.
it
must
in
the
employment
context.
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
cardoza
said
in
the
sheffield
case,
that
an
employer
in
the
end
must
be
responsible
for
his
own
work
force,
regardless
of
who
he
delegates
things
to,
whether
or
not
it
is
an
independent
agency,
whether
or
not
it's
a
foreman,
it
is
the
employer
in
the
end
which
has
a
duty
to
make
sure
that
its
work
force
isn't
plagued
with,
as
was
the
case
here,
intentional
racial
discrimination.
if,
for
example,
an
exemption
was
found
under
1981
because
instead
of
relying
on
a
foreman
an
employer
chose
to
rely
on
a
union
or
an
employment
agency
or
any
independent
contractor,
it
would
be
a
massive
loophole
in
1981.
faced
with
virtually
this
question
in
radio
officers,
a
case
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1954,
the
court
imputed
intentional
discrimination
under
section
8(b)(2)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
employers,
and
that's
all
that
we
are
saying
here,
and
it
is
vicarious.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
in
the
end,
can
any
employer
function
in
this
day
and
age
except
vicariously?
after
all,
if
we
phrase
this
in
terms
of
a
foreman
and
posed
it
in
terms
of
glasgow,
not
knowing
whether
or
not
its
foreman
engaged
in
racial
discrimination,
i
would
submit
that
the
court
would
conclude
that
whether
glasgow
knew
what
its
foreman
was
doing
would
be
irrelevant.
in
fact,
that
was
virtually
the
facts
in
the
furnco
case
with
henry
dacies.
the
issue
here
then
must
become
whether
or
not
employers
have
an
exemption
because
they
have
a
right--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
we
are
drawing
the
same
principle
here.
let
me
refer
as
an
example
to
the
instance
where
in
a
14th
amendment
case,
and
i
don't
cite
it
to
state
action
purposes,
coke
versus
the
city
of
atlanta,
justice
marshall
argued
that
case.
in
coke,
the
black
plaintiff
was
denied
access
to
eating
facilities
in
the
atlanta
airport
which
had
been
segregated.
the
city
of
atlanta
had
no
control
over
the
restaurant.
it
didn't
know
there
was
any
discrimination.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
restaurant
was
a
franchise,
and
the
main
corporate
office
had
no
knowledge
that
discrimination
was
taking
place.
they
had
no
control
over
it.
in
an
injunction
that
was
issued
against
atlanta
and
against
the
corporate
defendants,
largely
relying
upon
cases
following
burton
v.
wilmington
parking
authority,
the
court
found
that
that
discrimination
could
be
imputed.
now,
again
i
go
back
to
this
fact,
minorities
did
not
have
the
same
right
to--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
they
were
held
vicariously
liable
by
judge
higginbotham.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
the
difference
is
the
association,
acting
as
an
agent
for
its
members
and
ultimately
for
an
entire
industry,
required
every
employer
to
rely
on
a
racially
discriminatory
union.
in
the
end
the
employers--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--they
did
finally,
in
1971,
and
that
was
breached.
and
that
was
breached.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
instance
of
section
1981
the
statute
must
perforce
require
employers
to
make
sure
that
minorities
have
the
same
rights
as
whites
to
work.
and
it
is
clear,
and
it
is
undisputed,
that
minorities
did
not
have
that
right.
i
think
the
question--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
the
lawyer
who
negotiated
that
contract
in
my
judgment
would
not
be
liable.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
the
associations
are
liable
because,
acting
as
agents--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--but
the
lawyers
weren't
necessarily
agents
for
the
employers.
you
see,
the
associations--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--i
think
that
if
they
hired
a
lawyer
to
negotiate
it
the
lawyer
would
not
have
any
personal
liability.
but
i
think
in
this--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--the
associations
here
did
enter
into
collective
bargaining,
and
they
did
two
things--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--if
a
lawyer
created
himself
or
herself
as
the
entity,
as
an
association
would
be
the
entity,
negotiated
the
agreement,
compelled
its
members
to
rely
on
what
was
a
racially
discriminatory
union,
and
signed--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--it
would
be
the
same
under
that
example,
yes,
sir.
but
we
are
saying
with
respect
to
the
associations
that
here
they
created
an
industrywide
system,
a
system
which
compelled
their
members,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
non-members,
to
rely
on
a
union
which
practiced
intentional
racial
discrimination.
now,
the
fact
that
they're
an
association
and
not
an
employer
doesn't
advance
the
argument
much
further,
because
in
the
end
of
course
associations
don't
employ
people.
employers
often
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
will
create
associations
to
bargain
on
their
behalf.
they
also
created
them
in
this
instance
to
set
up
the
joint
apprenticeship
program,
and
the
associations
appoint
trustees,
and
the
apprenticeship
program
engaged
in
intentional
racial
discrimination,
all
of
which
is
undisputed.
now,
in
our
judgment,
faced
with
those
facts,
judge
higginbotham
correctly
held
the
associations
liable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
in
assessing
the
remedial
costs
of
the
injunction
judge
bechtel
assessed
more
liability
against
the
associations
because
of
their
high
degree
of
culpability.
i
read
before
from
judge
higginbothem's
opinion
that
he
found
they
engaged
in
reckless
acts,
denying
my
clients
equal
employment
opportunities.
and
i
think
in
this
instance
an
agent
for
an
employer
who
compels
the
employer
to
rely
on
a
hiring
hall,
and
that
hiring
hall
then
engages
in
discrimination,
must
be
held
accountable.
there
is
no
exemption
in
1981
for
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
must
create
a
responsibility
in
the
end
on
an
employer.
it
seems
to
me
every
labor
law
that
we
have
creates
generally
obligations
on
employers
and
rights
on
employees.
the
only
thing
different
about
this
case
is
the
active
discriminator
was
local
542.
the
victims
were
the
same,
minorities.
the
parties
suffering
the
discrimination,
that
is
feeling
it
in
their
work
force,
were
the
same,
the
employers.
the
result
couldn't
be
clearer.
employers
in
this
particular
instance
didn't
have
minority
operating
engineers
because
of
racial
discrimination.
1,036
employers
never
hired
a
minority
operating
engineer
because
of
their
reliance
on
the
union.
judge
higginbothem
alternatively
found
that
the
hiring
haul
was
a
joint
venture,
as
was
the
apprenticeship
program.
we
believe
that
that
finding
should
not
be
subject
to
reversal
under
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
in
the
end,
these
were
joint
undertakings.
they
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
employers.
they
had
a
ready
source
of
labor
by
relying
on
the
union
and
relying
on--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir.
now,
in
that
respect--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--yes.
judge
higginbothem
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
apprenticeship
program
was
used
as
a
device
to
steer
minorities
to
it,
while
unskilled
whites
who
had
absolutely
no
background
were
steered
into
other
mechanisms.
the
result
was
three
types
of
discrimination:
one,
minorities
kept
out
of
the
joint
apprenticeship
program;
for
the
few
minorities
who
did
get
in,
they
were
discriminated
against
in
work
and
wages;
and
finally,
there
was
discrimination,
found
judge
higginbothem,
in
preventing
minorities
from
completing
the
program.
so
there
were
three
types
of
discrimination
found,
all
of
which
were
intentional,
all
of
which
was
joint,
and
none
of
which
has
been
challenged
here.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
no.
stage
one
of
this
year
and
a
half
trial
focused
on
liability
and
injunction
questions
only.
stage
two,
dealing
with
back
pay,
has
yet
to
commence.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
that's
unchallenged.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
25
percent
of
the
remedial
costs.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
40

mr.
harold
i.
goodman
the
three
associations,
10
percent
each,

5
percent,
giving
glasgow,
if
it
chose...
and
it
has
not
chose...
a
right
of
contribution
against
other
class
members.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
it
was.
there
were
important,
critically
important,
reasons
why
the
employers
were
necessary
for
the
decree,
and
i'd
like
to
cover
that
now.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir.
stage
two,
which
i
prefer
to
call
a
back
pay
stage,
has
yet
to
commence.
it
largely
will
depend,
of
course,
upon
the
result
reached
here.
but
judge
bechtel,
the
present
district
judge
assigned
to
the
case,
has
begun
recently
to
commence
the
process
of
identifying
the
victims
of
that
discrimination.
but
that's
a
separate
part
of
the
case
and
judge
higginbothem
bifurcated
the
case.
i
hate
to
think
how
long
it
would
have
lasted
in
addition
to
the
year
and
a
half
it
did
if
the
damage
phase
was
tried
conjunctively
with
the
liability
phase.
i
was
saying
earlier
that
judge
higginbothem
concluded
that
there
were
critically
important
reasons
why
the
employers
were
necessary
to
the
injunctive
relief,
and
i'd
like
to
touch
on
those
now.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes,
sir,
even
under
the--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--yes,
sir,
that's
absolutely
correct.
let
me
say
first,
though,
on
the
issue
of
intent,
before
i
directly
address
that
question,
that
the
intentional
discrimination
here
that
we
are
trying
to
assess
against
the
employers
and
the
associations
is
imputing
it.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
and
we
think
the
cases
support
that
clearly.
but
going
beyond
that,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
there
are
independent
grounds.
they
are
premised
on
the
all
writs
act
for
one,
and
they
are
also
premised--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--no,
it
was
not.
it
was
not
the
rationale
of
the
district
court.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
the
court
might
do
that.
i
don't
think
it
in
this
instance
would
be
compelled
to.
but
let
me
say
that,
beyond
the
all
writs
act,
as
a
matter
of
the
broad
discretion
vested
in
the
district
court
to
correct
intentional
discrimination,
judge
higginbothem
had
the
power
and
exercised
it,
justice
white,
apart
from
the
all
writs
act,
to
include
the
employers.
now,
as
a
preface,
just
last
week
in
zipes
versus
trans-world
airlines,
this
court
over
objections
by
a
union
who
had
not
been
found
guilty
of
any
violation
of
title
vii
or
1981
held
that
it
should
be
included
in
the
remedy
for
reasons
of
making
whole
the
victims
of
discrimination,
regardless
of
their
alleged
nonculpability.
justice
white,
you
authored
that
opinion
and
focused
upon
those
precise
arguments,
and
you
called
them
meritless.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
employers
were
critically
necessary
for
the
following
reasons:
the
first
is
self-evident:
they're
the
only
ones
who
provided
the
work.
they're
the
only
ones
who
provided
the
wages.
they
were
necessary
because
the
only
way
minorities
could
get
a
nondiscriminatory
share
of
the
work
in
the
next
five
years
is
to
include
them
in
the
decree.
and
i
say
nondiscriminatory
because
it's
a
gradual
remedy
over
five
years,
and
it's
not
until
the
fourth
or
fifth
year
that
nondiscrimination
as
measured
by
the
population
of
minorities
in
the
labor
force
will
be
reached.
so
that's
the
first
reason.
the
second
reason,
and
the
critical
reason,
is
that
the
district
court
was
in
this
instance
more
than
just
familiar
with
the
history
of
the
philadelphia
plan
and
the
history
of
discrimination
in
this
industry.
he
knew,
as
the
federal
government
knew,
that
a
philadelphia
type
plan
remedy
was
absolutely
necessary,
or
else
equal
employment
opportunity
could
never
be
achieved.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court,
in
order
to
implement
the
injunctive
relief
in
this
case.
i
think,
phrased
another
way,
the
question
is
can
the
district
court
as
an
exercise
of
its
discretion
assess
remedial,
as
opposed
to
damage
or
back
pay,
relief
against
parties
whom
it
found
to
be
critically
necessary
to
achieving
the
injunctive
relief
we
achieved
here?
and
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
district
court
did
have
the
discretion
to
do
so
and
just
as
in
kuran,
for
example,
in
the
eleventh
amendment
case,
where
the
state
could
not
be
sued
in
damages
because
of
the
bar
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
this
court
has
held,
despite
that
bar,
district
courts
have
the
discretion
to
award
costs
against
the
state.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
it's
hard
to
speculate
in
respect
to
that,
your
honor.
but
i
would
say
this,
that
judge
bechtel,
who
succeeded
judge
higginbothem
in
the
case,
in
large
measure
assessed
the
10
percent
liability
against
general
building
contractors
association
because
of
the
factual
finding
that
they
recklessly
disregarded
the
rights
to
equal
employment
opportunity
of
my
clients.
so
that
was
triggered
into
a
factual
finding
of
judge
higginbothem.
but
again,
it
is
hard
to
speculate.
but
i
do
not
believe
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
that
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
which
was
assume
that
there
was
no
violation,
could
a
district
court
exercise
its
discretion
or
did
it
have
the
power
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
assess
portions
of
remedial
costs
against
a
non-wrongdoer--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--well,
of
course
we
believe
very
strongly
that
judge
higginbothem
correctly
found
vicarious
liability
against
the
employers.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
so
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
question.
however,
if
the
court
reaches
that
separate
question,
just
as
zipes
last
week
held
that
a
union
which
was
not
culpable,
had
no
claims
to
anything
other
than
wrongdoer
status,
was
being
compelled
to
reorder
its
seniority
lists
in
order
to
make
whole
as
a
matter
of
an
injunction
the
victims
of
discrimination,
judge
higginbothem
in
this
case
i
think
had
that
same
discretion
to
exercise.
and
i
think
he
correctly
exercised
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
obscured
but
ought
to
be
pointed
out
here
that
in
this
particular
case
the
employers
themselves
suggested
the
very
remedy
which
judge
higginbothem
imposed.
they
recognized
in
the
end
that
the
duty
not
to
discriminate,
the
duty
to
comply
with
section
1981,
was
on
them.
so
they
asked
the
district
court
to
set
goals
in
order
to
provide
nondiscrimination,
and
they
said,
we
should
be
permitted
to
hire
outside
of
the
union
if
we
have
to
in
order...
and
i
quote
them...
"to
ensure
equal
employment
opportunity".
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
well,
obviously
the
court
order
permitted
them
to
overcome
any
opposition
they
had
from
the
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--the
injunction
very
well
might
have
done
that,
and
that
request
for
relief
very
well
might
have
done
that,
that's
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
pointed
out,
shortly
after
the
liability
opinion
was
filed
gbca
and
caep
filed
a
grievance
under
the
contract.
so
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
the
associations
not
only
do
have
the
power
to
file
grievances,
but
in
this
instance
exercised
it
to
seek
an
arbitration
award
that
relieved
them
of
any
responsibility
for
local
542.
they
secured
that.
the
arbitrator
gave
them
that.
but
judge
higginbothem
found
that
that
order
would
have
denied
minorities
the
equitable
relief
against
the
employers
that
they
were
entitled
to,
and
for
that
reason
denied
it,
denied
the
motion
to
uphold
that
arbitration
award.
but
i
think
as
well,
chief
justice
burger,
the
notion
that
local
542
held
a
pistol
to
the
heads
of
1500
companies
and
associations
and
compelled
it
to
rely
on
it
and
compelled
it
to
engage
in
collective
racial
discrimination
that
was
intentional,
misstates
the
facts
here.
again,
your
honor,
for
the
last
18
years
there's
never
been
any
evidence
of
any
strike
or
coercion.
but
even
if
there
was
a
strike
and
a
coercion,
suppose
a
union
compelled
in
some
sort
of
way
an
employer
to
rely
on
it.
the
question
becomes,
if
the
employer's
work
force
is
then
found
to
be
the
product
of
intentional
racial
discrimination,
must
it
be
free?
is
it
free
to
be
able
not
to
give
minorities
the
rights
they're
entitled
to?
we
think
not.
in
the
end,
the
employers
do
the
employing.
in
the
end
my
clients,
minorities,
were
the
victims.
in
the
end,
they
weren't
just
denied
fraternal
rights
in
local
542,
they
weren't
denied
the
rights
of
participation
in
some
blue
cross-blue
shield
program;
they
were
denied
the
right
to
work.
dwayne
johnson,
who
is
symbolic,
operates
heavy
equipment
in
vietnam.
he
operates
heavy
equipment
in
korea.
he
comes
back
to
philadelphia.
he
wants
work.
he
goes
to
an
employer.
he
cannot
go
to
the
employer.
they
can't
hire
him.
he
is
told
to
go
to
local
542.
they
won't
let
him
in
because
of
the
color
of
his
skin.
he
goes
to
greenland
to
work
for
a
non-union
employer.
he
comes
back
to
542:
i
want
work,
i
want
wages.
he's
kept
out
because
of
his
race.
now
what
he
wants...
and
dwayne
johnson
is
symbolic
of
500
or
more
minorities...
is
the
right
guaranteed
to
him
under
section
1981
to
work
for
the
employers
on
the
same
basis
as
whites.
he
was
denied
it,
and
all
the
other
dwayne
johnsons
have
been
denied
it.
they
have
a
right,
in
our
judgment,
to
work
on
the
same
basis
as
whites.
people
who've
given
their
lives
to
this
country
it
seems
to
me
have
that
right,
and
it's
been
guaranteed
since
1966.
and
i
think
ultimately
the
question
here
is,
what
if
we
sued
just
glasgow
and
did
not
sue
local
542.
what
if
we
showed
the
same
set
of
facts,
that
glasgow
had
zero
minorities
and
all
whites,
and
that
that
work
force
was
the
product
of
intentional
racial
discrimination?
could
there
be
any
doubt
that
for
purposes
of
injunctive
relief,
simply
to
get
prospective
nondiscrimination,
that
minorities
with
respect
to
glasgow,
under
those
sets
of
facts,
would
have
a
right
to
work
equally?
not
quotas,
not
something
special,
but
nondiscrimination.
that's
all
paragraph
12
of
this
decree
provides,
nondiscrimination,
to
prevent
the
reoccurrence
of
discrimination.
in
this
particular
instance,
in
our
judgment
the
employers
have
recognized
what
we
have
contended,
that
the
duty
is
on
them.
they
have
recognized,
i
think,
what
justice
cardoza
said,
and
that
is
the
duty
under
labor
laws
must
be
non-delegable,
because
if
they
were
not
non-delegable
there
would
be
enormous
loopholes
in
the
law.
in
the
sheffield
case,
which
i
think
is
interesting
only
because
it
doesn't
deal
in
the
race
area,
there
was
a
new
york
statute
which
said
that
employers
could
not
employ
anyone
under
the
age
of
14.
and
the
bus
company
had
one
of
its
bus
drivers,
as
a
matter
of
helping
him,
hire
a
boy
who
was
12
years
old.
the
company
knew
nothing
about
it.
it
had
no
knowledge.
it
didn't
know
what
was
going
on.
justice
cardoza
said,
in
upholding
criminal
liability
under
a
new
york
labor
statute,
that
it
is
not
an
example
of
respondeat
superior;
it
is
an
example
of
non-delegable
duty,
a
duty
the
employer
owed
in
that
case
not
to
employ
children.
in
this
case,
after
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
company,
this
court
has
said
that
the
ban
against
employment
discrimination
and
the
need
to
protect
the
right
of
minorities
in
that
respect
is
of
the
highest
priority.
it
seems
to
me
in
the
end
that
the
employers
in
this
case
must
have
that
obligation.
if
it
were
just
left
up
to
local
542,
my
clients
could
not
get
a
remedy.
it
would
be
impossible.
in
the
end,
judge
higginbothem
in
our
judgment,
a,
properly
imputed
intentional
discrimination
of
the
union
and
the
apprenticeship
program
to
the
employers;
secondly,
he
properly
exercised
his
discretion
to
give
the
plaintiffs
a
make-whole
remedy
that
would
ensure
nothing
more
nor
less
than
nondiscrimination
over
the
next
five
years.
after
years
of
intentional
discrimination,
proof
of
which
is
undisputed
in
this
case...
examples
of
people
could
be
told
and
told
again,
but
judge
higginbothem
has
done
that
far
more
eloquently
than
i
can...
it
is
our
submission
that
minorities
do
have
the
same
right
to
work
as
whites.
they
did
not
have.
they
are
entitled
to
a
remedy.
