justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
federal
election
laws,
the
congressional
campaign
committees
of
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
are
not
among
those
political
committees
that
are
authorized
to
spend
money
to
further
the
election
of
their
respective
candidates.
the
national
committees
of
the
two
parties
however
as
well
as
the
state
committees
of
the
parties
are
authorized
to
make
such
expenditures
up
to
the
amount
specified
in
the
law.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
republican
senatorial
campaign
committee
is
authorized
under
the
act
to
act
as
the
agent
of
a
state
committee
in
making
expenditures
that
the
state
committee
is
specifically
authorized
to
make.
the
federal
election
commission
in
rejecting
a
complaint
of
the
democratic
party
held
that
the
agency
arrangement
is
permissible.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed.
in
its
view,
the
plain
terms
of
the
act
foreclosed
the
congressional
committee
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state
committee.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
we
do
not
agree
that
the
plain
language
of
the
act
forbids
this
agency
relationship
between
the
congressional
committee
and
the
state
committee.
we
also
think
that
the
agency's
construction
of
the
act
is
a
reasonable
one
and
we
should
defer
to
it
as
a
permissible
way
of
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
our
views
are
set
out
in
greater
length
in
an
opinion
we
have
filed
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
court
is
unanimous.
mr.
justice
stevens
however
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
