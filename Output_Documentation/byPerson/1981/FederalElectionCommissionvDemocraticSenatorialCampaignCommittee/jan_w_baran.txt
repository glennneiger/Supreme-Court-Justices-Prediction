mr.
jan
w.
baran
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner,
national
republican
senatorial
committee,
a
committee
of
the
republican
party,
seeks
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
just
as
the
federal
election
commission
does.
our
essential
reason,
set
forth
in
our
brief,
is
that
the
statute
in
question,
which
i'll
refer
to
as
subsection
(d)(3),
simply
does
not
prohibit
the
conduct
that
the
democratic
committee
is
complaining
of.
the
limits,
as
mr.
steele
has
indicated,
have
not
been
exceeded
with
respect
to
the
total
dollar
amount,
and
it
was
noted
so
by
judge
wilke
in
his
dissent,
as
well.
what
is
being
complained
of
is
a
method
utilized
within
the
political
party
for
most
effectively
spending
the
money
on
behalf
of
senatorial
candidates.
and
that
method,
which
has
been
used
by
the
republican
party
in
1978
and
in
1980
on
occasion
and
only
voluntarily,
is
for
the
state
committees
of
the
republican
party
to
designated
the
petitioner,
nrsc,
as
an
agent
for
purposes
of
spending
funds
on
behalf
of
these
candidates.
the
respondent
has
never
in
the
course
of
the
administrative
proceeding
or
before
any
of
the
courts
below
suggested
that
the
total
amount
of
money
spent
for
any
specific
senate
candidate
in
any
state
has
been
exceeded
by
the
republican
party.
unlike
the
federal
election
commission,
we
do
address
the
potential,
although
we
feel
unnecessary
to
reach,
constitutional
issues
that
would
arise
if
the
court
of
appeals
decision
were
upheld.
as
judge
wilke
noted
in
his
dissent,
the
interpretation
that
has
been
engrafted
on
this
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
place
a
restriction
in
the
way
of
the
political
party
in
terms
of
most
effectively
supporting
its
senate
candidates,
even
though
it
would
be
within
the
statutory
limitation.
unlike
the
compelling
governmental
interest
that
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
which
is
the
prevention
of
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption,
that
interest
is
not
advanced
in
furtherance
of
any
such
restriction.
the
respondent
in
their
briefs
suggest
solely
a
government
interest
in
revitalizing
the
state
committees
of
the
political
parties.
the
republican
party
is
certainly
touched
by
this
outpouring
of
concern
on
the
part
of
the
democratic
committee
for
the
well
being
of
republican
state
committees.
it
certainly
is
unprecedented,
to
say
the
least.
but
in
terms
of
actual
purpose
behind
subsection
(d)(3),
there
is
no
reflection
in
the
legislative
history,
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
that
there
was
any
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
when
they
passed
subsection
(d)(3)
back
in
1974
to
limit
its
benefits
solely
and
narrowly
to
the
state
committee.
the
congress
was
concerned
with
providing
a
still
substantial
role
in
private
financing
for
political
parties
generally,
but
certainly
not
just
for
the
state
committees.
and
furthermore,
as
noted
earlier
by
mr.
steele,
there
are
provisions
within
the
statute
itself
that
would
indicate
that
congress
views
the
parties
as
basically
one
large
entity
and
one
large
organization
within
the
united
states
for
financing
purposes,
to
the
point
where
unlike
virtually
any
other
component
of
campaign
financing,
any
of
the
committees
of
the
same
party
can
shift
unlimited
funds
back
and
forth
to
each
other;
implicitly
recognizing
that
it's
up
to
the
political
parties
to
make
a
decision
on
how
to
best
structure
their
campaign
financing
within
the
overall
limitations
contained
in
the
act.
for
those
reasons,
as
set
forth
in
greater
detail
in
our
brief,
the
petitioner
nrsc
requests
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
thank
you.
