mr.
charles
nevett
steele
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
expenditures
provided
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act
for
political
party
committees
made
in
connection
with
the
general
election
campaigns
of
candidates
of
that
political
party.
the
amount
awarded
by
the
statute,
allotted
by
the
statute,
is
two
cents
per
voter;
technically,
two
cents
per
voter
age
population,
which
is
the
amount
that
the
statute
sets
for
the
expenditures.
the
case
arose
before
the
federal
election
commission
on
a
complaint
filed
by
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee.
that
complaint
challenged
the
practice
of
the
national
republican
senatorial
campaign
committee
and
the
state
party
committees
of
the
republican
party,
in
which
they
agreed
that
the
state
party
committee's
allocation
under
the
statute
would
be
expended
by
the
national
republican
senatorial
campaign
committee.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes,
and
the
statute
makes
that
very
clear,
as
i
think
the
statutory
history
will
show.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
the
transfer
of
authority
in
this
case
was
from
the
state
parties
in
the
individual
states
of
the
spending
limit
of
two
cents
per
voter
that
they
would
otherwise
have
for
the
candidates
for
the
senate
in
their
state.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
in
that
state,
yes.
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
sought
the
commission's
reversal
of
an
earlier
decision
for
a
similar
practice
in
1978.
complaint
before
the
commission
explicitly
asked
that
that
decision
be
overruled;
that
the
commission
seek
injunctions
and
civil
penalties
against
the
practice
of
the
national
republican
senatorial
campaign
committee.
the
commission
on
july
11,
1980
found
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
allegation
stated
a
violation
of
the
act
and
refused
to
take
action
on
the
complaint.
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
sought
review
as
the
statute
provides
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
under
the
statutory
provision
437g(a)(8),
which
provides
that
the
district
court
may
review
the
commission's
action
on
a
complaint
and
determine
whether
it
was
contrary
to
law.
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
appealed
that
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals;
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
finding
that
the
statute's
manifest
purpose
banned
the
practice
of
these
agreements,
found
that
the
basis
on
which
the
commission
in
earlier
decisions
had
established
this
rule
presented
a
shifting
basis,
gave
no
deference
to
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
ordered
that
the
commission
proceed
forthwith
under
the
enforcement
responsibilities
in
the
statute,
which
dscc
had
invoked
by
its
complaint.
those
enforcement
responsibilities
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
intend
to
go
through
them
in
great
detail.
they
provide
for
complaints
filed,
notice
to
the
opposite
parties.
if
the
commission
finds
reason
to
believe,
investigation,
conciliation
and
eventual
results
would
be
that
the
commission
would
find
probable
cause
to
believe.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
i
think
that
is
analogous
to
the
nlrb
and
other
administrative
law
cases
i
think
was
the
analogy
that
they
were
drawing
on.
we
would
submit
that
it
is
different
here
in
that
what
the
commission
is
doing
is
exercising
a
prosecutorial
authority
rather
than
an
adjudicatory
authority
such
as
the
national
labor
relations
board
act.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
it
certainly
has,
and
i
think
the
cases
that
we've
cited
reflect
that.
the
commission
would
submit
that
there
was
no
shifting
basis
in
its
approach
to
these;
that
indeed,
the
very
fact
that
the
dscc
sought
reversal
of
the
decision
in
mur
780,
as
it
is
noted
in
the
commission's
records,
is
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
came
to
the
same
results
in
earlier
cases.
but
i
do
think
that
in
the
cases
that
you
cite,
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
shift,
that
that
would
still
be
within
the
discretionary
authority
of
the
commission
if
it
was
rationalized
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
but
i
do
think
this
court
has
recognized
that...
the
ability
of
an
administrative
agency
to
re
examine
its
position
should
not
be
foreclosed.
the
case
raises
issues
both
procedural
and
substantive
in
this
case.
substantively,
the
question,
which
i
will
address
in
a
moment,
is
whether
the
commission
was
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
would
like
for
a
moment,
however,
to
touch
upon
the
procedural
issue
because
i
think
the
two
are
intertwined
in
such
a
way
as
to
demonstrate
the
problem
that
the
commission
has
in
the
procedural
aspects
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
the
central
issue
in
the
case,
in
a
sense,
is
whether
the
statute
so
clearly
prohibits
the
sort
of
agreement
that
was
entered
into
here;
that
it
was
unwarranted
for
the
fec
not
to
prosecute
the
case,
not
to
go
forward
under
the
provisions
that
it
has
for
seeking
enforcement
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
in
its
opinion,
it
was
not
a
discretionary
exercise
of
commission
power
that
was
at
issue
here,
but
solely
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
and
it
is
precisely
on
that
point
that
the
commission
thinks
that
the
court
below
erred;
erred
in
relationship
to
other
cases
that
it
has
decided
with
regard
to
the
federal
election
campaign
act
in
the
commission's
exercise
of
its
enforcement
responsibilities,
and
erred
more
broadly
in
the
overall
context
of
administrative
law.
indeed,
as
we
have
submitted
in
our
brief,
it
would
seem
that
the
exercise
of
the
prosecutorial
power,
the
power
to
enforce
the
statute,
is
one
that
throughout
the
jurisprudence
of
this
country
has
been
seen
as
a
discretionary
one.
what
you
have
here
is
the
decision
by
the
commission
that
it
should
not
go
forward
in
that
mode.
the
decision
of
the
commission
was
based
on
a
legal
analysis;
there
was
not
a
factual
investigation
here.
nonetheless,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
suggests
that
the
commission
must
go
forward.
now,
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
the
commission
is
structured
in
a
way
unlike
many
other
commissions.
it
requires...
it's
a
six
member
body,
it
requires
the
positive
votes
of
four
members
to
bring
such
an
action.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
the
vote
here
was
unanimous.
the
vote
in
all
three
of
the
earlier
decisions
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
case,
one
advisory
opinion
back
in
1976
and
in
the
two
enforcement
cases
in
1978,
all
of
them
were
unanimous.
they
were
all
six
nothing
with
the
exception
of
one
of
the
two
mur's
where
there
were
only
five
members
present,
but
it
was
also
unanimous.
those
safeguards
for
the
commission's
processes
include,
as
i
noted,
the
four
votes
required.
there
is,
of
course,
the
composition
of
the
commission.
it
is
balanced
so
that
there
can
be
no
vote
of
four
members,
by
all
the
members
of
one
party,
as
the
statute
prohibits
the
commission
from
having
more
than
three
members
of
any
one
party.
with
regard
to
the
merits,
the
commission
submits
that
its
interpretation
was
not
only
reasonable,
but
was
really
quite
consistent
with
the
statute.
i
would
emphasize,
however,
that
it
seems
to
the
commission
that
the
standard
that
should
be
here
applied
is
not
whether
its
interpretation
was
the
only
one,
but
only
whether
its
interpretation
in
light
of
the
act,
the
words
of
the
act,
the
context
of
the
act,
was
a
reasonable
one.
so,
as
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned,
even
if
the
statute
is
at
least
ambiguous
it
should
prevail
in
this
case,
because
the
interpretation
placed
upon
it
by
the
court
below
that
required
the
commission
to
go
forward
was
that
the
statutory
mandate
was
clear.
the
review
provision
in
437g(8)
provides
that
the
commission's
actions
will
be
reviewed
to
see
if
they
are
contrary
to
law.
and
the
commission
concedes,
as
i
think
would
be
true
even
without
that
statute
but
with
the
statutory
provision
there,
that
obviously
any
dismissal
of
a
complaint
is
reviewable
by
the
courts.
the
commission
is
not
contesting
that
those
decisions
are
not
reviewable.
the
question
is
what
the
standard
is
that
would
be
applied.
in
examining
the
merits,
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
to
note,
first
of
all,
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
and
of
the
district
court
in
no
way
increased
the
limits
that
the
statute
provides
for
the
spending
in
question.
441a(d)(a)(3)
provides
that
the
national
committee
of
a
political
party
may
send
two
cents
per
voter
age
population,
and
that
the
state
committee
may
spend
two
cents
per
voter
age
population.
that
total,
four
cents
for
the
party,
has
not
been
increased
by
the
decision
of
the
commission
below.
what
the
decision
of
the
commission
below
said
was,
that
the
state
party,
which
has
a
two
cents
per
voter
age
population
authority
for
spending
under
the
statute,
that
the
state
party
could
assign
that
to
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee;
that
there
was
no
bar
in
the
statute
to
that
action.
the
argument
of
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
accepted
by
the
court
below
was
that
the
statute,
by
providing
separate
limits
for
the
national
party
and
the
state
party,
makes
explicit
that
that
limit
must
be
spent
by
the
national
committee
or
must
be
spent
by
the
state
committee,
and
that
there
could
be
no
transfer
of
it.
initially
in
1976,
when
the
democratic
national
committee
filed
a
complaint
and
then
withdrew
it,
there
was
an
advisory
opinion
by
the
commission.
the
commission
under
437f,
2
usc
437f,
is
authorized
to
issue
advisory
opinions
to
any
person
who
requests
them
about
specific
transactions
in
which
they
are
engaged.
in
that
opinion,
the
commission
very
clearly
stated
that
in
its
view
the
national
republic
congressional
committee
there,
not
the
senatorial
campaign
committee.
the
two
committees
in
question,
one
for
the
senatorial
side,
one
for
the
congressional
side,
for
the
house
side,
are
two
separate
committees.
but
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
they
are
the
same
because
they
represent
the
same
interests,
one
for
the
senate
side,
one
for
the
house
side.
the
commission's
decision
in
ao
1976-108
explicitly
stated
that
under
its
interpretation
of
the
statute,
referred
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1976
amendments
after
this
court's
decision
in
buckley,
that
the
national
republic
congressional
committee
was
a
committee
of
the
national
committee
of
the
party.
that
is
to
say
that
it
could
be...
the
national
committee
could
assign
to
that
committee
its
spending
limits.
that
the
national
republic
congressional
committee
could
spend
its
funds
on
a
delegation
from
the
republic
national
committee.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
they
would
be...
the
transfer
provision
would
provide
it
to
them
as
political
committees
of
the
same
party.
and
we
would
argue
certainly,
the
fact
that
they
could
transfer
all
the
funds
would
allow
them
to
do
the
identical
matter
that
they
did
here.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
well,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
that
there
was
loss
of
control;
that
here
the
state,
by
giving
up
its
spending
authority
to
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee
no
longer
retained
control.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes.
or
by
our
reasoning
the
same
thing
could
have
been
accomplished
by
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee,
transferring
the
funds--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--yes.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
i
don't
think
that
you
do,
and
indeed,
i
think
that's
the
case
that
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
is
trying
to
make.
that
there
is
a
difference
there,
but
we
would
see
no
difference
there.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes,
it
is.
and
i
would
cite
the
decision
that
i
was
just
mentioning,
ao
1976-108,
in
which
the
commission
explicitly
stated
that
on
the
basis
of
legislative
history
from
the
76
amendments.
that's
cited
at...
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
the
page
in
our
brief,
but
it's
listed
in
our
table
on
pages
25
and
29,
and
the
commission
there
explicitly
held
that.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
i
don't
see
why
you
do,
either.
again,
i
think
that
that
is
our
case,
and
i
think
you're
stating
it
for
me.
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
i
believe,
is
that
by
aggregating
these
two...
the
statute
441a(d)(3)
provides
a
two
cents
for
the
national
committee
and
a
two
cents
for
a
state
party
committee,
and
that
somehow
the
statute
by
providing
those
separate
limits,
which
we
agree
that
that
allows
the
state
committee
not
to
transfer
that
to
the
national,
so
that
the
state
committee
has
the
authority
to
retain
that
spending
power
if
it
wishes,
and
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute...
there's
no
mention
in
the
statute
of
any
prohibition
of
any
arrangement
like
this,
that
at
the
very
best
the
court
below
had
to
rely
on
the
inference
that
by
stating
the
two
separate
limits,
that
it
meant
that
there
should
be
no
transfer.
the
court
below
also
stated
that
its
belief
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
strengthen
the
state
parties...
again,
even
conceding
that
that's
so,
which
i
don't
think
there's
much
citation
of
legislative
history
to
support
that,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
statute
under
the
commission's
interpretation
allows
that.
it
allows
the
state,
if
it
wishes
to,
to
retain
that
spending
authority.
to
turn
for
just
a
moment
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below
with
regard
to
the
question
as
to
the
shifting
basis,
not
only
would
we
contend,
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
that
even
had
there
been
a
shift
here
that
it
enabled
the
agency
to
make
that
kind
of
decision
and
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
having
this
kind
of
process.
but
we
would
submit
that
throughout
all
three
of
those
decisions,
the
basic
elements
which
i
have
set
forth
in
discussing
the
merits,
were
there
stated.
the
basic
authority
that
the
commission
relied
on
in
all
of
them,
including
ao
1976-108,
was
the
transfer
authority.
the
court
said
that
in
some
of
the
earlier
mur's
the
emphasis
was
on
that
and
on
the
failure
of
the
statute
to
explicitly
prohibit
this
kind
of
transfer,
and
said
that
later
decisions
of
the
commission
suggested
a
shifting
basis
in
that
we
then
noted
in
this
mur
in
particular
that
later
developments,
that
the
congress
had
legislation
specifically
in
front
of
it...
the
house
of
representatives
had
legislation
specifically
in
front
of
it
which
would
have
prohibited
the
transfers
proposed
by
the
house
administration
committee.
there
was
a
rule
against
that
bill
going
forward,
and
we
set
forth
in
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
administrative
decision
in
this
case,
mur
1234
sets
forth
six
or
seven
quotations
from
various
congressmen,
congressmen
frenzel,
stockman,
conable,
mikva,
davis,
both
sides
of
the
aisle,
that
the
very
purpose
of
that
bill,
the
reason
that
they
were
speaking
against
it,
of
the
rule
to
report
the
bill
out,
was
because
it
was
going
to
prohibit
these
kind
of
transfers.
and
on
that
basis
we
would
think
that
the
commission's
decision
is
not
only
reasonable
but
is
in
accord
with
the
legislative
history.
i
would
reserve
any
further
comment.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
with
regard
to
the
question
of
why
441a(h)
was
not
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
the
fact
is
that
the
complaint
that
was
lodged
with
the
comission
alleged
a
violation
of
441a(d)(3),
and
perhaps
i
might
just
refer,
justice
stevens,
you
to
that
section
as
seeming
to
set
forth
the
prohibition
that
you
were
asking
for.
the
beginning
of
that
section,
a
(d)(1),
says,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law
with
respect
to
limitations
on
expenditures
or
limitations
on
contributions,
the
national
committee
of
a
political
party
and
a
state
committee
of
a
political
party,
including
any
subordinate
committee,
may
make
expenditures
in
connection
with
the
general
election
campaign
of
candidates
for
federal
office,
subject
to
the
limitations
set
forth.
"
those
limitations
are
set
forth
in
subsections
(2)
and
(3).
(2)
pertains
to
the
presidential
election.
(3),
which
was
what
was
put
at
issue
before
the
commission
and
before
the
courts,
pertains
to
the
congressional
elections.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
i
understand.
the
prohibition--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--yes,
it
is.
the
prohibition
language,
in
almost
perhaps
an
inverted
way,
comes
in
subsection
(3)
where
it
says,
"the
national
committee
of
a
political
party
or
a
state
committee
of
a
political
party,
including
any
subordinate
committee,
may
not
make
any
expenditure
in
connection
with
the
general
election
campaign
of
a
candidate
for
federal
office
in
a
state
who
is
affiliated
with
such
party,
which
exceeds.
"
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes.
and
as
we
have
said,
it
is
not
the
national
committee.
what
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
in
the
advisory
opinion
that
i
referred
you
to,
is
that
there
are
subordinate
committees
of
the
national
committee.
indeed,
dscc
itself
makes
expenditures
on
behalf
of
the
dnc,
and
that
that
delegation
has
never
been
questioned.
that
is
the
delegation
explicitly
set
forth
in
110.7
of
our
regulations.
so
that
the
delegation
by
the
national
committee
of
its
spending
authority
to
subordinate
committees
has
been
accepted
by
the
commission.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
it
is
a
subordinate
committee;
it
is
not
the
national
committee.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
of
the
national
committee.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
that's
correct.
that
was
the
question
posed
to
the
commission
in
ao
1976-108
where
the
commission,
again
relying
on
the
statutory
history
of
the
1976,
the
conference
report
of
the
1976
amendments,
came
to
the
conclusion
it's
the
view
of
the
commission
that
the
specified
campaign
committees
are
committees
of
their
respective
national
political
parties.
and
on
that
basis,
seized
them
as
being...
we
set
forth
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
the
various
committees.
so
the
commission
has
viewed
the
national
committee
as
having
many
subordinate
committees.
i
apologize
if
my
answer
earlier
misled
you.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes,
that
was
a
later
enacted
statute,
i
might
note.
that
was
passed
in
1976,
and
a(d)(3)
was
passed
in
1974.
it
is
not
specifically
mentioned
in
a(d)(3).
the
commission's
position
would
be
that
it
is...
that
nrsc
and
the
dscc
are
subordinates
to
the
national--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--that's
correct.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
the
significance
of
it
is
that
they
are
all
part
of
the
same
national
committee,
as
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned.
they
are
branches
of
the
same--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--yes.
which
is
not
explicit
in
the
statute.
