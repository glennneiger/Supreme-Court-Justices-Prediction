unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
only
on
behalf
of
the
candidate
in
that
state?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
that
differs
from
the
transfer
provision,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
that
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
when
you
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
commission
had
shifted
its
position,
would
that
be
roughly
analogous
to
the
nlrb?
unknown
speaker
hasn't
this
court
recognized
the
fact
that
the
nlrb
may,
from
time
to
time,
shift
its
position,
and
either
one
may
be
right?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
vote
here?
unanimous?
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
may
i
ask,
i
noticed
that
the
only
thing
argued
below,
i
gather,
was
the
validity
of
the
agency
agreements
and
not
any
validity
of
fund
transfers.
my
question
is
this:
could
everything
they
attempted
to
do
by
agency
agreements,
they
have
done
under
441a(a)(4)
by
transfer
of
funds
if
the
congressional
committees
are
not
political
committees
within
a(a)(4)?
unknown
speaker
then
why
all
the
fuss?
what
difference
does
it
make?
unknown
speaker
and
transferred
the
funds,
if
the
prohibition
of
a(a)(4)
doesn't
apply
to
it,
and
if
the
state
committee
had
transferred
to
the
senatorial
committee,
apparently
the
same
thing
could
have
been
accomplished,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
under
agency
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is
really,
why
do
we
have
to
fuss
over
the
agency
agreement
if
they
could
do
it
under
a(a)(4)
under
the
transfer
provision?
unknown
speaker
while
you've
been
interrupted
may
i
just
ask,
in
your
view
is
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee,
the
committee
that's
a
party
to
this
case,
a,
quote,
"national
committee
of
a
political
party.
"
within
the
meaning
of
441a(d)(3)?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
correct,
then
again,
the
case
is
all
over,
isn't
it?
because
they
have
not
spent
more
than
that
section
permits
them
to
spend,
is
that
correct?
i
don't
quite
understand
why
we
have
to
even
get
into
the
transfer
of
spending
authority.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bauer,
before
you
get
too
far
along,
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
me
if
you
identified
the
language
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
what
the
nrsc
has
done.
because
if
they're
not
a
national
committee
within
the
meaning
of
441(a)(d)(3),
i
take
it
441(a)(d)(3)
just
simply
doesn't
apply
to
nrsc.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bauer,
following
up
on
justice
stevens'
question,
where
is
the
prohibitory
language
about
which
he
asked?
i've
got
open
the
brief
of
the
fec
at
pages
2
and
3,
which
purportedly
set
forth
the
statutes
involved.
unknown
speaker
for
the
prohibitory
language--
unknown
speaker
--so
your
reasoning
is
basically
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bauer,
what
about
a(a)(4)?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
congressional
committees
do
not
fall
within
the
prohibition
of
431a(a)(4),
why
can't
they
clearly
exchange
with
the
state
committees?
unknown
speaker
what
may
they
do
with
the
money?
they
may
transfer
it
freely.
what
may
they
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
that
they
may
not
do?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
commission
ignored
its
own
regulations?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
by
regulation,
you
suggest?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
that
bar?
unknown
speaker
they
being?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
by
regulation.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
the
only
regulation
that--
unknown
speaker
--where
do
we
find
that
in
the
briefs?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
this
whole
issue
was
not
canvassed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
read
its
opinion.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
except
that
it
says,
the
parties
have
not
argued
the
validity
of
funds
transfers.
unknown
speaker
but
only
of
agency
agreements.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
we're
talking
about
now
was
not
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
i
interrupted
you
and
you
were
going
to
tell
us
where
that
regulation
was.
where
in
your
brief
is
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
set
forth?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bauer,
i
really
need
more
help
from
you.
you've
taken
us
into
the
regulations,
and
i'd
like
to
stick
with
the
statute,
if
i
could,
for
a
little
bit.
and
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
explain
to
me
where...
assuming
that
the
nrsc
is
not
a
national
committee
within
the
meaning
of
441a(3),
where
in
the
statute
is
there
a
prohibition
against
nrsc
expending
money?
unknown
speaker
what
has
it
done
that's
illegal,
other
than
spend
funds?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
didn't
need
a
spending
authority;
if
there's
no
bar
on
its
spending
funds,
how
did
it
violate
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
it
that
limits
the
amount
that
can
be
spent
by
nrsc?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it,
and
in
what
section
of
the
statute
may
i
find
it?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
section
quoted
in
the
briefs?
unknown
speaker
441a(h)--
unknown
speaker
--i
hate
to
do
this,
but
which
brief
at
which
page,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
is
it
quoted
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
not
quoted,
even
"that
is
the
provision"
that
you
allege
they
violated?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
didn't
violate
that,
and
that's
the
only
statutory
provision
that
prohibits
them
from
spending
money,
how
can
they
have
violated
the
statute
if
they
didn't
violate
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
hoping
i
could
get
the
basic
framework
of
the
statute.
you
must
rely
on
regulations
to
find
a
violation,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
did
they
violate
any
section
other
than
441a(h)?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
their
own
choice,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
they're
not
compelled
to
make
their
assignment
to
the
national
senatorial
committee.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bauer,
would
you
just
enumerate
for
me
what
are
the
limitations
on
state
committee
expenditures?
unknown
speaker
they
want
to
transfer
agency
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
with
the
nrsc,
but
you
say
they
can't.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
what
that
means.
if
they've
got
$50,000,
you're
saying
they
can
transfer
the
$50,000
but
they
can't
transfer
whatever
the
requirement
is
that
they
spend
the
$50,000,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
that
they
have
to
spend
the
$50,000
on?
unknown
speaker
and
what
happens
to
the
rest
of
the
money?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
the
state
committee
had
kept
the
$50,000,
what
may
they
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
limitations
on
how
much
of
the
$50,000
they
may
spend
on
a
particular
candidate.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
what
do
they
propose
to
do
with
this
money?
unknown
speaker
but
has
it
distributed
any
money?
unknown
speaker
they
have
used
the
authority
and
spent
the
money.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
they
can't
do
either.
unknown
speaker
let
me
back
up
a
little,
mr.
bauer.
if
you
have
addressed
the
question
of
the
interpretation
placed
on
this
statute
by
the
agency
i
missed
it.
now
certainly,
of
all
the
agencies
created
by
congress,
i
would
assume
that
the
people
selected
for
this
kind
of
a
commission,
which
is
unique,
three
from
each
party
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
would
hardly
be
political
neophytes.
they'd
be
people
who
are
very
sophisticated
politically,
which
might
not
necessarily
be
true
of
an
appointee
to
the
federal
communications
commission
or
federal
power
commission,
who
might
or
might
not
be
sophisticated
in
the
particular
area.
now,
what
weight
should
be
given
by
the
judiciary
to
the
interpretation
of
the
congressional
mandate
by
this
uniquely
expert
and
sophisticated
commission?
now,
those
are
my
objectives.
you
don't
have
to
adopt
them.
what
weight
should
be
given?
unknown
speaker
but
it
seemed
clear
just
the
other
way
to
the
six
members
of
the
commission
who
passed
on
it
initially,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
even
your
own
democrats.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bauer,
can
i
go
back
to
the
statute
again,
because
i
think
i'm
beginning
to
understand
your
argument.
0
[generallaughter.]
if
i
understand
it,
you're
saying
that
subsection
(h)
which
places
a
limit
on
the
contributions
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee
can
make
to
any
state
candidate
is
1$7,500.
and
that
when
it
spends
more
money
than
that
in
behalf
of
the
candidate,
it
is,
in
effect,
making
an
additional
contribution
to
the
candidate.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore,
you've
violated
the
prohibition
against
contributions
in
excess
of
this
amount.
unknown
speaker
so
your
violation
in
this
case
that
you
rely
on
is
the
amount
over
$17,500
that
they
spend
for
any
given
candidate.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
they
did,
in
fact,
spend
more
than
$17,500?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
amazed
that
nobody
quoted
subsection
(h)
in
their
briefs.
unknown
speaker
but
one
of
the
beauties
of
the
adversary
system
is
we
don't
have
to
rely
on
our
adversary
to
quote
the
relevant
statutory
language.
unknown
speaker
how
much
higher
than
$17,500
was--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
could
amount
to
how
much?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but
my
problem
all
along
has
been,
and
i
think
justice
rehnquist
may
have
made
a
similar
observation,
that
this
is
authorizing
language,
it's
not
prohibitory
language,
in
(1),
(2)
and
(3).
and
i
have
to
start
with
a
prohibition
somewhere
in
the
statute
in
order
to
find
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
agree
that
what
you've
referred
to
is
authorizing
language.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but,
of
course,
then
the
one
issue
is
whether
or
not
nrsc
is,
quote,
"the
national
committee",
and
your
opponent
says
that's
a
term
defined
in
the
statute,
and
that
this
is
not
that
particular
committee.
unknown
speaker
let
me
again
just
put
to
one
side
delegation
questions.
did
i
correctly
understand
you
in
your
opening
argument
to
take
the
position
that
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee
is,
quote,
(d)(3)?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
the
national
committee
now.
but
is
it
a
committee
referred
to
in
(d)(3)?
there's
no
other
language...
oh,
you
say
it
is
a
subordinate
committee
of
what?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
reference
to
subordinate
committee
of
the
national
committee
in
(d)(3),
is
there?
unknown
speaker
i'm
still,
i
must
confess
but
i'll
study
it
further,
a
little
uncertain
of
your
position
on
whether
the
statute
itself
in
(d)(3)
makes
reference
to
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee,
which
isn't
mentioned
by
name
in
subsection
(h).
unknown
speaker
but
that
section
also
does
not
mention
subordinate
committees
of
the
national
committee.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
the
legal
significance
of
classifying
those
committees
as
subordinate
committees
of
the
national
committee?
i
really
have
lost
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
construe
the
statute
as
though
it
read
the
national
committee
of
a
political
party
or
any
subordinate
committee
of
a
national
committee
of
a
political
party
may--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
