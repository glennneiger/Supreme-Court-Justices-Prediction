mr.
robert
f.
bauer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
what
is
striking
about
the
last
few
minutes
of
argumentation
offered
by
the
fec
and
the
nrsc
is
that
in
construing
the
plain
language
of
the
provision
in
question,
what
mr.
baran
referred
to
as
(d)(3),
neither
side
offered
any
analysis
of
the
plain
terms
of
that
provision.
that
is
until
justice
stevens
asked
general
counsel
steele
whether
nrsc
was
a
national
committee
within
the
meaning
of
that
section.
general
counsel
steele
responded
that
it
was,
which
is
a
mis
analysis
of
the
plain
terms
of
the
provision
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
agency's
difficulty
from
the
beginning
of
this
case.
the
terms
in
section
(d)(3),
subsection
(d)(3),
are
not
ambiguous.
they
are
separately
defined
in
the
definitions
provision
of
the
feca.
the
definition
about
which
justice
stevens
inquired,
the
national
committee,
is
defined
under
section
431(14)
of
the
feca
as
the
organization...
that
is,
one
organization...
which
by
virtue
of
the
bylaws
of
a
political
party
is
responsible
for
the
day
to
day
operation
of
such
political
party
at
the
national
level.
the
nrsc
is
decidedly
not
the
national
committee
of
a
political
party,
it
is
a
sub
unit
of
the
national
party
structure,
but
the
commission
itself
has
recognize
that
it
is
the
republican
national
committee,
which
is
not
a
party
to
this
case,
which
is
the
national
committee
under
subsection
(d)(3).
more
to
the
point
is
the
analysis
of
what
state
committees
are.
once
again,
congress
separately
defines
state
committees
in
the
definitions
provision
of
the
act,
and
it
is
concededly...
in
fact,
conceded
by
all
the
parties
to
this
litigation...
that
nrsc
is
not
a
state
committee.
how
is
it,
then,
that
the
agency
has
construed
this
provision,
which
confers
defined
limits
on
specifically
defined
entities,
to
allow
nrsc
not
named
or
referred
to
in
that
provision
to
rest
unto
itself
the
limit
that
congress
has
assigned
to
another?
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
has
been
the
agency's
inability
over
a
course
of
decisionmaking
to
offer
a
single
consistent
rationale
for
overcoming
the
plain
terms
of
this
provision.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens,
with
one
exception
i
should
note
here.
and
that
is
that
in
1976,
the
federal
election
commission
promulgated
a
regulation
following
oral
comment,
hearings
and
submission
to
congress
subject
to
the
one
house
veto
provision,
which
purported
to
allow
the
national
committee,
under
subsection
(d)(3),
to
assign
its
spending
rights
to
any
agent.
this
was
the
sole
exception,
as
the
fec
interpreted
it
at
that
time,
and
as
congress
approved
it
at
that
time,
to
the
defined
limits
and
defined
committees
of
subsection
(d)(3).
in
this
litigation,
however,
for
the
first
time
before
the
court
of
appeals
the
fec
disavowed
its
prior
interpretation
of
this
regulation
and
now
claims
that
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
to
subsection
(d)(3),
but
instead
applies
only
to
subsection
(d)(2)
involving
presidential
elections.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
justice
rehnquist,
congress--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--there
is
no
language
which
prohibits
assignments
by
name.
however,
the
construction
of
the
provision
itself
and
an
analysis
of
the
relationship
to
that
provision
of
other
provisions
to
the
act,
suggest
a
conclusion
very
contrary
to
that
suggested
here
by
mr.
baran.
party
committee
limits
are
not
fungibled.
they
are
not
assignable,
unless
congress
expressly
so
state.
and
in
some
instances...
and
this,
it
seems
to
us,
answers
the
argument
fully...
in
some
instances,
congress
has
provided
precisely
and
specifically
for
the
assignment
of
limits
by
one
party
committee
to
another,
but
it
has
been
explicit
where
it
has
done
so,
and
it
has
not
done
so
in
subsection
(d)(3).
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
it
also
draws
strength
from
the
point
that
i
just
suggested
to
you,
and
that
is
that
where
congress
did
intend
party
committee
limits
to
be
assignable,
it
expressly
stated
so.
in
subsection
(d)(3),
for
example,
congress
expressly
authorizes
state
committees
to
assign
their
limits
altogether
to,
or
to
share
them
with,
subordinate
committees
of
the
state
party.
similarly,
nrsc,
as
a
congressional
committee,
possesses
a
$17,500
contribution
limitation,
which
it
is
expressly
authorized,
again
by
the
feca,
to
share
with
the
national
committee
of
a
political
party,
of
its
party.
so
congress
was
very
clear
that
if
limits
were
to
be
assigned,
it
wished
to
have
the
final
say
so
in
the
matter,
and
it
did
not
provide
for
this
assignment
authority
in
subsection
(d)(3).
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
a(a)(4)
also
does
not
have
the
effect,
it
decidedly
does
not
have
the
effect,
of
rendering
the
limits
themselves,
the
integrity
of
the
limits,
for
party
committees
and
nullity.
it
is
essentially
the
position
of
the
fec
that
because
party
committees
can
transfer
funds
freely
among
themselves,
then
the
limits
that
congress
has
given
specific
party
committees
should
be
disregarded.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
they
absolutely
can
exchange
funds
freely
with
the
state
committees,
justice
brennan.
what
they
cannot
do...
they
can
exchange
money.
money
may
be
freely
traded.
what
cannot
be
freely
traded
or
assigned
is
the
spending
authority
itself,
which
congress
made
specific
to
different
party
committees.
money
may
pass
freely,
but
congressionally
assigned
spending
rights
may
not.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
they
might
use
it
for
subsection
(d)(3)
purposes,
(d)(2)
purposes;
they
may
use
it
for
contribution
limitations,
they
might
use
it
to
fund
their
administrative
expenses.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
which
is
in
the
record
of
this
case
suggests
that
when
congress
crafted
the
transfer
provision,
all
that
it
really
had
in
mind
was
sort
of
a
general
facilitation
of
intra
party
cooperation,
and
senator
hatfield
referred,
for
example,
specifically
to
the
possibility
that
one
committee
could
help
another
extinguish
its
debts.
but
there
is
no--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--the
transfer
provision
is,
in
two
instances
which
directly
bear
on
this
case,
barred,
or
at
least
its
use
is
barred.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
in
the
federal
election
commission
regulations
at
section
100.7.
in
those--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--well,
in
this
particular
instance
the
use
of
the
transfer
provision
is
barred
where
state
party
committees
are
engaging
in
certain
activities
which
are
not
involved
in
(d)(2).
but
i
was
responding
to
justice
brennan's
question
about
whether
there
is
ever
any
explicit
bar
on
transfers
for
a
particular
purpose,
and
there
is.
in
the--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--it
is
by
regulation,
the
commission
having
drawn
upon
language
in
the
legislative
history
of
those
provisions.
congress
had
provided--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--the
bar
is
that
if
the
state
party
committees
are
to
spend
for
certain
special
purposes--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--they
being
unlimited,
get
out
the
vote
and
voter
registration
expenses
in
presidential
campaigns,
and
so
called
volunteer
activities,
where
they
can
purchase
without
limit
bumper
stickers,
buttons,
yard
signs,
which
volunteers
may
use.
in
those
cases,
the
state
committees
alone
have
that
spending
authority
and
they
may
not
accept
funds
for
that
purpose
from
the
national
committee
of
their
party.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
and
that
is
by
commission
regulation
drawing
upon
language
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that
is
the
only
regulation
on
this
point.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
it
would
be
found
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
and
i
can--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--the
court
of
appeals
did
draw
upon
the
provisions
in
question.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that's
correct,
not
under
section
(d)(2).
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that's
correct,
under--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--what
we're
talking
about
now
was
only
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
one
point
which
is
critical
here.
and
that
is
that
congress
has
been
continually
concerned
that
state
party
committees
have
a
financial
lever
with
which
they
can
maintain
their
position
in
the
electoral
process.
they
have
provided
for
an
array
of
special
spending
provisions
which
state
party
committees
and
only
those
committees
may
use.
and
the
purpose
in
those
provisions
as
in
subsection
(d)(2)
is
to
guarantee
the
position
of
these
parties
in
an
age
of
national
fund
raising
power
and
expensive
media
power.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
it
is
cited--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--oh,
it
is
set
forth
in
great
detail.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
it
is
set
forth
in
the
material
on
the
legislative
history,
which
appears
beginning
page
23
and
concludes
on
page
30,
and
the
provisions
that
i
am
discussing
appear
at
pages
28
through
30.
the
same
provisions
that
i
have
discussed
in
response
to
yourself
and
justice
brennan.
and
in
those
provisions,
there
is
manifested
broadly
this
congressional
concern
that
state
party
committees
have
discrete
and
integral
limits
which
cannot
be
freely
traded
away
in
contravention
of
congressional
purposes.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
there
is
no
prohibition,
certainly,
on
nrsc
expending
money,
justice
stevens.
in
fact,
nrsc
has
in
section
441a(h)
a
discrete
contribution
limitation
which
it
shares
with
the
national
committee
of
$17,500.
so
it
has
never
been
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
nrsc
is
barred
from
spending
funds.
nor
has
it
been
our--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--it
has
assumed
the
congressional...
the
spending
authority
assigned--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--the
statute,
your
honor,
provides
generally
for
all
committees,
party
and
non
party,
that
where
funds
are
spent
in
support
of
a
clearly
identified
candidate
in
cooperation
with
that
candidate,
the
amounts
that
can
be
spent
are
limited.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
nrsc
as
other
committees,
as
other
party
committees
are,
is
subject
to
specific
spending
limits
in
the--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--you
may
find
it
in
section
441a(h),
where
that
and
the
other
congressional
campaign
committees
are
cited
by
name.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
yes,
it
is,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that's
correct,
441a(h).
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
political
committees
of
a
party
to
have
discrete
limits--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--i
suspect
in
all
the
briefs,
justice
stevens,
but
in
our
brief
it
is
cited
at
pages
26
and
37.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
it
is
not
cited
at
length
in
any
of
the
briefs,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
your
honor,
our
allegation
has
not
been
that
they're
violating
441a(h).
our--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--justice
stevens,
the
problem
lies
in
the
history
of
this
litigation.
there
used
to
be,
until
the
fec
disavowed
it,
an
additional
source
of
spending
by
nrsc
by
regulation.
in
1976,
as
i
mentioned--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--no,
your
honor,
because
absent
that
regulation
by
the
commission
which
provided
nrsc
with
a
separate,
with
a
separate
source
of
funding,
and
a
considerably
substantial
one,
absent
that
regulation
it
is
absolutely
correct
that
by
receiving
an
assignment
of
funds
from
the
state
party
committees...
excuse
me,
receiving
an
assignment
of
authority
from
the
state
party
committees,
nrsc's
expenditures
did
violate
the
act.
it,
in
fact,
violated
441a(h).
absent
the
regulation.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
party
committee
limits
have
been
deemed
by
congress
to
be
specific
can
be
answered
by
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
subsection
(d)(2).
that
provision,
leaving
aside
its
plain
terms
which
do
not
refer
to
nrsc,
was
enacted
in
1974,
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
congressional
committees
in
1974.
in
fact,
there
was
pending
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
at
that
time
a
proposal
to
exempt
the
congressional
committees
altogether
from
spending
limits,
and
that
proposal
was
rejected.
in
1976,
the
question
of
nrsc
spending
authority
was
raised
yet
again,
and
this
time
it
was
raised
through
a
$17,500
contribution
limit,
which
it
shares
with
the
national
committee
of
its
party.
but
not
at
that
time
nor
in
the
years
before
did
congress
elect
to
confer
upon
nrsc
a
share
in
the
state
committee's
spending
authority
under
subsection
(d)(3).
it
was
a
considered
question
by
congress,
and
congress
addressed
it
forthrightly.
similarly,
the
transfer
provision
is
no
answer.
while
it
is
true
that
funds
can
be
transferred
freely
between
committees,
it
is
also
clear
from
the
scheme
of
the
act
and
its
legislative
history
that
party
committee
limits
are
not
fungible.
unless
congress
has
expressly
stated
that
those
limits
are
to
be
shared
or
assigned,
and
it
has
in
the
provisions
i
cited
to
justice
rehnquist,
assignability
is
barred.
in
the
last
analysis,
the
fec
and
nrsc
in
this
case
have
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
said
what
difference
does
it
make;
form
over
substance.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
state
committees
spend
the
funds
or
whether
nrsc
does.
respondent
submits
that
the
question
of
form
or
substance
in
matters
of
policy
are
not
for
the
agency
to
make.
it
is
for
congress
to
make
policy
judgments
in
the
election
scheme.
in
any
event,
the
question
of
form
which
is
before
this
court,
is
decidedly
one
of
substance.
for
in
this
subsection
(d)(3),
as
in
other
provisions
of
the
act
which
i've
cited
in
the
colloquy
with
justice
rehnquist,
congress
made
specific
provision
for
special
spending
rights
by
state
committees
and
their
subordinate
units,
and
it
did
so
because
of
a
very
strongly
expressed
concern
that
these
committees
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
maintain
their
role
absent
this
special
provisions
of
congress.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
congressional
concern
was
by
no
means
unfounded,
for
uncontroverted
in
that
record
is
evidence
that
in
1978
when
these
state
committee
nsrc
authority
assignments
were
first
made,
state
party
committees
spent
virtually
no
money
under
the
authority
provided
under
subsection
(d)(3).
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
at
the
same
time,
congress
did
not
foreclose
from
holding
out
an
incentive
to
these
entities
to
try
to
maintain
their
own
place.
and
certainly,
the
availability
of
this
assignment
authority
only
makes
it
easier
for
state
committees
to
essentially
abdicate
the
role.
it
is
far
easier
for
a
national
fund
raising
base
like
nrsc
to
raise
the
money
for
congressional
elections
across
the
country
than
for,
say,
the
state
committees
of
missouri,
kentucky,
iowa
and
alabama.
yet
congress
held
out
to
those
committees
that
incentive
to
do
so,
to
raise
the
money
and
then
spend
it
in
their
own
congressional
elections,
and
the
assignability
of
those
limits
completely
contradicts
this
congressional
purpose.
so
it
is
that
the
record
shows
that
through
this
spending
pattern,
section
441a(d)(3)
has
essentially
been
stood
on
its
head.
what
was
intended
as
an
incentive
to
state
and
local
party
organizations
has
instead
been
turned
into
a
supplement
to
national
fund
raising
power.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
buckley,
in
an
age
of
media
politics,
expensive
polling
techniques
and
other
refined
forms
of
campaigning,
money,
very
expensive
money,
certainly
talks.
and
without
the
special
provision
made
for
the
state
committees,
the
aggregation
of
power
will
be
pulled
further
and
further
toward
the
national
center
of
the
country,
which
is
a
result
congress
sought
to
avoid.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
justice
brennan,
state
committees
may--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--they
cannot
transfer
the
spending
authority.
they
may
transfer
funds
for
whatever
purpose
they
choose
to
other
party
committees.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
the
significance--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--well,
this
is...
that
is
probably
the
most
significant
point
in
our
case,
justice
brennan,
and
it
goes
to
what
justice
stevens
asked
me
about
nrsc's
own
spending
limit.
let
us
assume
for
purposes
here,
without
again
addressing
the
fec
regulation,
that
nrsc
is
limited
to
$17,500
to
a
candidate.
and
let
us
assume
that
a
state
committee
then
transfer
to
nrsc
$50,000.
all
that
nrsc
can
do
to
influence
the
outcome
of
a
specific
candidate's
election
is
spend
$17,500.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
presumably,
nrsc
makes
some
arrangement
to
spend
it
for
some
other
purpose,
but
not
in
congressional
elections,
which
is
precisely
why
if
the
committee's
limits
were
respected,
the
additional
money
that
the
committee
would
retain
at
the
state
and
local
level--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--they
may
make
a
contribution
to
a
candidate
of
$5000
per
election;
they
may
make
expenditures
equivalent
to
two
cents
multiplied
by
the
voting
age
population
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that's
precisely
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
the
nrsc
took
the
transfers
of
authority
from
the
state
committees,
thereby
substantially
increasing
its
own
limit,
and
indeed--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--it
has
distributed
millions
under
this
transfer
of
authority
to
senate
candidates.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that
is
correct.
they
have
used
state
committee
authority,
and
nrsc
has
spent
the
money,
its
money,
for--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--it
may
receive
the
transfers,
but
it
may
not
double
its
own
limit
with
the
limit
of
the
state
committees.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
they
should
receive
the
substantial
weight
and
the
substantial
deference
that
is
ordinarily
accorded,
perhaps
no
more
than
that,
to
agencies
that
are
charged
with
administering
particular
statutes.
but
this
case
really
raises
the
threshold
to
something
very
different.
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
an
agency
can
disrespect
the
law.
the
plain
terms
of
this
provision,
and
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
a
whole
suggests
that
they
are
permitting
the
bandying
about
the
assignment
of
authority
which
congress
intended
to
be
specific
to
particular
committees.
now,
if
there
was
room
open
under
this
provision
for
different
interpretations
of
which
committees
may
spend
and
which
committees
may
not,
respondent
might
not
be
here.
but
this
provision
could
not
be
clearer.
congress
selected
particular
terms
and
then
went
to
great
lengths
to
define
them.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
respondent
submits,
and
as
a
committee
subject
to
the
continuing
regulation
of
the
federal
election
commission
it
has
a
special
stake
in
expressing
its
concern,
that
unanimity
of
opinion
on
that
agency
not
be
considered
sufficient
to
overcome
the
plain
terms
of
any
provision.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
even
our
own
democrats,
justice
brennan.
honest
differences
of
opinion,
but
on
this
case
we
happen
to
think
we
have
the
law
on
our
side.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
and
i
might
emphasize
to
nail
that
point
home,
because
i
know
you're
eager
for
me
to
do
so,
that
the
act
specifically
defines
subsection
(d)(2)
expenditures
as
contributions.
there
has
been
much
weight
placed
for
constitutional
purposes
by
nrsc
on
the
identity
of
this
spending
as,
quote,
expenditures.
but
the
statute
itself
defines
coordinated
expenditures,
expenditures
which
are
arranged
with
the
candidate,
as
no
different
functionally
than
contributions.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
yes,
it
does.
the
joint
appendix
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
notarized
affidavits
with
substantial
figures
for
each
state.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
murkier
moments
in
this
litigation
was,
i
fear,
created
by
the
federal
election
commission
because
it
used
to
be
that--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--that
is
correct.
but
the
regulation
which
we
relied
on
to
suggest
that
maybe
nrsc
had
a
higher
than
$17,500
contribution
limit,
that
regulation
was
in
force
until
all
of
a
sudden
in
this
litigation
the
fec
changed
its
mind,
said
it
didn't
apply.
so
a
regulation
interpreted
one
way--
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
--it
was
the
two
cents
per
voting
age
population
in
each
state
as
agent
of
the
national
committee
of
the
political
party.
mr.
robert
f.
bauer
it
could
amount,
under
the
figures
in
the
joint
appendix,
to
slightly
in
excess
of
three
million
dollars,
nationally.
so
it
was
in
light
of
that
confusion
over
what
precisely
nrsc's
spending
authority
was
that
i
think
all
parties
backed
away
from
addressing
themselves
forthrightly
to
441a(h)
versus
perhaps
some
other
provision.
while
i
do
not
believe
that
it
merits
excessive
attention
here,
nrsc
has
offered
yet
another
in
a
long
string
of
interpretations
to
support
the
fec's
position.
and
that
is
a
constitutional
claim,
which
i
do
not
think
this
court
need
reach
in
light
of
the
plain
terms
of
the
provision.
the
nrsc's
claim
has
to
be
understood
first
of
all
as
not
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
any
limitation
on
state
party
committee
spending.
none
of
the
parties
to
this
litigation
are
quarreling
over
whether
congress
can
constitutionally
limit
political
party
spending.
the
question
instead
is
whether,
within
this
overall
scheme
of
limits,
congress
may
direct
that
certain
committees
can
spend
a
certain
amount
and
other
committees
a
different
amount
for
specific
and
well
defined
purposes.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
certainly
to
support
nrsc's
contention
that
its
first
amendment
rights
are
impermissibly
burdened
by
an
agency
proscription.
nor
is
it
likely
that
that
evidence
could
be
developed.
political
parties
have
exceptionally,
exceptionally
broad
avenues
of
spending
participation
available
to
them
under
the
act.
avenues
which
are
not
available
to
non
party
committees,
and
subsection
(d)(3)
is
one
example.
and
whatever
infringement
may,
in
fact,
result
from
proscribing
these
agency
agreements
and
enforcing
congressional
will,
they
are
certainly
marginal
when
measured
against
the
government's
very
compelling
concern
with
maintaining
the
state
and
local
political
party
role
in
the
electoral
process.
that's
a
concern
which,
of
course,
is
federalist
at
heart.
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
scholarly
opinion
supporting
the
view
that
this
is
absolutely
necessary,
and
we
would
not
be
quarreling
about
it
if
the
agency
in
this
case
had
done
what
we
urge
this
court
now
to
do,
and
that
is
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below,
have
subsection
(d)(3)
construed
as
it
was
written,
and
thereby
bring
the
agency
back
into
conformity
with
the
rule
of
law
under
this
statutory
scheme.
