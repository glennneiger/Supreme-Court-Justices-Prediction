unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true
in
a
lot
of
cases,
mr.
kaufman,
where
nonetheless
a
federal
right
of
action
has
been
implied,
isn't
it?
j.
i.
case
v.
borak
and
cases
like
that?
unknown
speaker
but
even
in
some
of
our...
those
cases
where
a
private
right
of
action
has
been
implied,
say
cannon
v.
university
of
chicago,
there
there
was
no
federal
party
or
the
united
states
wasn't
a
party.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaufman,
to
what
extent
is
the
continuance
of
state
law
a
binding
obligation?
suppose
after
the
grant
is
made
the
state
changes
its
law,
wipes
out
collective
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
secretary
could
go
into
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
law
governing
if
the
secretary
went
in?
unknown
speaker
there
might
be
jurisdiction,
but
what
would
be
the
governing
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
lot
of
contracts
that
federal
law
requires
or
specifies
that
are
governed
by
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
what
about
an
ordinary
collective
bargaining
contract
subject
to
the
labor
laws?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't
mandate
it.
we
said
it
did,
but
that
isn't
what
the
statute
said.
unknown
speaker
so
it
might
as
well
have
said
it,
might
as
well
have
said
it.
may
i
ask
a
question
about
section
13(c)
agreement?
unknown
speaker
right
on
this
point.
i
think
it
is
quoted
in...
at
17a
of
the
joint
appendix.
there's
a
sentence
in
the
agreement
that
says
any
public
body
or
agency
shall
comply
with
the
requirements
of
10(c)
in
such
manner
as
is
necessary
not
to
reduce
or
impair
any
rights,
privileges
and
benefits
which
such
employees
of
such
transit
system
would
have
received
or
be
entitled
to
had
the
system
continued
under
its
former
private
management.
now,
had
it
continued
under
the
former
management,
the
rights
would
have
been
federal
rights,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
the
agreement
we
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
understand,
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
if
this...
they
would
have
had
federal
rights
before
and
those
are
preserved,
and
after
all
the
money
is
spent
so
there
is
no
remedy
in
cutting
off
further
funding,
why
couldn't
the
state,
under
your
view,
why
couldn't
the
state
simply
pass
a
statute
that
says,
well,
municipal
bodies
don't
have
to
abide
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
because
there
is
a
public
interest
in
management
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
opponents
in
effect
contend
it
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
right,
by
the
municipality.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
state
passed
a
new
statute
on
what
it
takes
to
ratify
a
contract
or
something
of
that
kind?
then
that
would
control
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
matter,
perhaps
it
wouldn't
happen,
but
you
say
as
a
matter,
conceptually,
there's
really
no
federal
objection
to
it
if
the
state
should
decide
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not...
that's
right,
and
i'm
troubled,
frankly,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
is
the
language
in
the
agreement
itself
here,
which
seems
to
contemplate
no
difference
in
the
substantive
rights
of
the
parties
before
and
after,
and
i
think
you
suggest
there's
a
rather
significant
difference.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
little
bit
of
an
overstatement,
isn't
it,
because
in
the
macon
case,
for
example,
in
order
to
get
the
federal
funding
they
would
have
had
to
modify,
adopt
new
state
laws.
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
condition
of
the
grant
is
a
change
in
state
law.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
the
state
law
after
the
grant
rather
than
before
the
grant.
unknown
speaker
but
no
obligation
to
make
it
continue
to
be
compatible.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
all
that
was
intended
by
congress
was
to
see
that
the
workers
would
be
no
worse
off?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
isn't
it
true
that
if
you
prevail
on
your
position
in
this
case,
that
will
be
the
last?
unknown
speaker
legally
it
could
be
the
last.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
differently.
assume
that
the
arbitrator
if
it
goes
to...
i
guess
it
goes...
if
it
goes
to
an
arbitrator.
i
don't
know
exactly
whether
it
would
or
not,
but
there's
a
ruling
that
the
ratification
was
not
proper.
therefore
the
agreement's
no
longer
in
effect.
as
a
matter
of
law
you
would
be
under
no
obligation
to
bargain,
would
you?
maybe
as
a
matter
of
policy
you
would
do
so.
unknown
speaker
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaufman,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
whether
it's
your
position
that
the
union
could
force
you
to
collectively
bargain
under...
by
virtue
of
section
13(c).
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question
to
follow
up
justice
o'connor's
question?
you
say
13(c)
creates
no
rights,
but
certainly
the
agreement
entered
into
pursuant
to
13(c)
between
the
transit
authority
and
the
union
creates
rights,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
creates
contract
rights
to
collectively
bargain,
those
could
be
enforced
in
state
court.
unknown
speaker
or
in
a
federal
court
if
there
were
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
be
a
question
of
contract
enforcement,
not
a
question
of
a
cause
of
action
under
a
statute.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
said
if
you
want
a
grant,
if
you
want
a
grant,
you
have
to
make
some
arrangements
to
preserve
them.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
you
want
a
grant,
why
you,
for
example,
must
adopt
the
contract
that
was
in
existence
before.
unknown
speaker
does
that
create
a
right?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
said
you
had
to
agree
to
be
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
law?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
condition
was
that
they
subject
themselves
to
the
national
labor
relations
act?
unknown
speaker
what
rights?
unknown
speaker
under
what?
unknown
speaker
under
what,
what
right
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
federal
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
yes,
they
were
agreeing
to
subject
themselves
to
the
national
labor
relations
act?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes,
they
just,
that's
the
way
you
construe
the
act.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
in
order
to
get
the
grant
they
had
to
agree
to
be
bound
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
effect
and
the
city
says,
well,
sure,
we'll
continue
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
as
long
as
it
lasts.
well,
the
contract
expires,
and
so
there's
no
more
contract
rights
right
then,
and
then
you
say,
well,
now
you
must
bargain
for
another
one.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
right
is
there
to
do
that?
i
mean,
what...
is
the
basis
for
it
the
national
labor
relations
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
just
continued
rights
that
they
had,
and
so
what
right
was
it?
unknown
speaker
forever?
unknown
speaker
once
having,
once
having
taken
the
money,
you
are
forever
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
what
that...
so
yes,
you
say
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mrs.
hirshman.
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
that
precise
point?
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
contract
expires
and
there's
bargaining
for
a
new
contract,
and
the
municipality
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
connection
with
the
bargaining.
you
don't
have
a
remedy
under
the
national
labor.
unknown
speaker
what
remedy,
if
any,
would
you
have?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
language
you
are
referring
to,
on
what
page?
unknown
speaker
what
is
at
issue
here,
the
enforceability
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
that
was
entered
into
pursuant
to
13(c)?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
and
that
federal
law
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
and
why
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
necessarily...
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
from
that
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
pursuant
to
13(c)
would
be
governed
by
federal
rather
than
state
law.
obviously
there's
a
binding
contract
that's
enforceable.
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
13(c)
agreement,
are
you
talking
about
the
collective
bargaining
contracts
entered
into,
or
the
agreement
entered
in
between
the
recipient
and
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
which
one
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
is
that
exhibit
c
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
and
is...
would
the
suit
that
would
be
brought
be
brought
to
enforce
that
agreement
technically?
unknown
speaker
well
the
national
labor
relations
act
doesn't
even
require
people
to
enter
into
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
bargain.
you
don't
have
to
enter
into
any
agreement.
unknown
speaker
let
alone
an
enforceable
one.
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
break
the
agreement,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
a
301
case,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
this
has
an
arbitration
clause.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
hirshman,
supposing
that
before
the
federal
funding
the
transit
authority
had
been
operated...
was
a
public
authority
and
had
been
acting,
had
been
operating
the
system
and
just
got
the
funds
to
improve
it.
now,
there
it
wouldn't
have
been
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
weren't
organized
before?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
13(c)
requires
that
there
be
a
binding
collective
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
but
no
agreement,
if
there's
no
agreement
reached,
then
where
does
this
stand?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
my
question.
what
if
no
agreement
is
ever
reached?
unknown
speaker
but
the
13(c)
doesn't
require
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
hasn't
determined
that
arbitration
is
necessary
on
the
terms
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
but
we
know
that
the
law
doesn't
require
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
agreement
that
was
entered
into
between
the
union
and
the
authority
pursuant
to
13(c)
expired
and
that
you
were
negotiating
a
new
contract
and
you
just
didn't...
there
was
an
impasse,
and
they
just
never...
there
was
never
a
contract,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
transit
authority
would
be
required
to
submit
the
terms
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
it
in
this
cas?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
it
didn't
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
that
you
are
suing
on?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
long
since
expired.
unknown
speaker
and
so
what
if
you
win?
unknown
speaker
but
only
damages,
only
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
it's
a
damages
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
so?
again
i
say,
what's
left
of
this
case
if
you
win?
damages.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
expired.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
measures?
what
are
the
measure
of
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
not
get
you
very
far,
assuming
you
prevailed,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
going
over
that
rather
fast,
with
cost-of-living
adjustments.
where
did
they
come
from?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
the
agreement
that's
expired.
unknown
speaker
up
until...
from
'76
to
'78?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
hirshman,
the
fact
that
the
agreement
is
required
by
federal
law,
which
you
have
stressed,
is
not
conclusive,
is
it?
in
miree
v.
dekalb,
which
is
cited
several
times
in
your
opponents'
brief,
the
agreement
there
was
required
by
federal
law,
too,
and
yet
we
held
that
state
law
would
government.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
the
traditional
way
that
labor
agreements
usually
are
enforced,
now,
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
a
school
board
and
its
teachers,
that
agreement
is
usually
enforced
in
state
court.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
it
should
govern
even
if
there
is
no
transfer,
in
other
words,
if
the
public
transit
company
had
been
in
the
public
sector
before.
unknown
speaker
would
that
sort
of
a
13(c)
agreement
then
be
suable
in
the
state
courts
and
not
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
not
this
case,
but
i'd
be
interested
in
your
answer
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
right
about
1983,
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
action
under
this
agreement
arises
under
federal
law,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
there,
if
it
arises
under
federal
law,
you
can
get
in
on
1331.
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
really
an
alternate
basis
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
were
suing
to
enforce
the
agreement
between...
what
if
the
secretary
were
suing
on
the
agreement
between
the
authority
and
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
governed
by
federal
law,
wouldn't
you
say?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10
o'clock.
