ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honor,
the
section
13(c)
preserves
rights.
that
language
is
right
in
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
section
13(c)(2)
you
see
that
it
says
the
continuation
of
collective
bargaining
rights.
there
is
no
distinction
between
create,
for
our
purposes
here,
between
creating
rights
and
preserving
the
rights
as
they
existed
before.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
because
when
these
employees
were
in
the
private
sector
they
had
rights
to
collective
bargaining
including
enforceable
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
could
not
be
torn
up
months
after
they
were
concluded.
and
what
congress
did
in
13(c)
was
look
at
that
situation
and
say
we're
going
to
preserve
those
rights
for
you.
we
are
not
going
to
all
federal
funding
to
be
the
vehicle
by
which
you
are
transferred
out
of
that
right-laden
position.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
the
statute
is
phrased
as
a
condition
on
the
receipt
of
federal
funds.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
that's
correct.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
there
are--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
it
preserves...
let's...
the
question
before
us
today
is
whether
it
continues
collective
bargaining
rights.
it
said
you
must
make
arrangements
to
continue
collective
bargaining
rights.
it
doesn't
need
to
create
rights
in
order
to
do
that.
it
preserved
them
from
the
prior
status.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no.
your
honor,
the
congress
made
it
i
think
quite
clear
what
it
was
intending
to
do
in
this
case.
without
amending
the
national
labor
relations
act
it
was
requiring
the
recipients
of
federal
transit
grants
to
make
binding
commitments
to
their
employees
and
also
to
the
united
states
that
they
would
not
divest
the
employees
of
their
labor
rights,
and
they
are
enumerated
in
the
statute.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no.
i
think
that
the
condition
was
that
they
continue
collective
bargaining
rights
as
that--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
in
this
case
it's
the
right
to
a
binding
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
there's
one
thing
that
we--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--pardon
me?
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
to
the
rights
that
were
created
by
the
labor
act
which
by
virtue--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--it
was
preserved
to
them
through
the
vehicle
of
section
13(c).
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
substantive
rights
that
we
understand
when
we
use
the
phrase
collective
bargaining
rights
includes
certainly
the
years
of
history
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
including
binding
collective
bargaining
agreements.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
right.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
the
basis
for
it
is
section
13(c)
of
the
urban
mass
transportation
act
which
obliged
them--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--they
would
have
rights
whose
substance
and
understanding
is
derived
from
the
years
of
experience
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
but
whose
actual
legal,
enforceable
source
is
section
13(c)
of
the
urban
mass
transportation
act,
and
that
came
up
in
congress.
i
mean,
that
came
up
in
the
debates
in
congress,
and
i
think
it
was
senator
morse
who
said
they
would
retain
their
rights,
not
by
virtue
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
by
virtue
of
the
arrangements
which
13(c)
will
oblige
them
to
make.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
the
national--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
you're
subject
to
the
commitments
that
you
make
as
a
condition
of
the
receipt
of
federal
funding.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
and
i
say,
your
honor,
that
if
you
take
your
employees
out
of
the
private
sector
and
transfer
them
into
the
public
sector
whereby
they
are
not
covered
by
the
strict
terms
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
congess
intended
to
bind
you
to
deal
with
them
in
the
ways
set
forth
in
section
13(c).
your
honor,
since
the
mid-1940s--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--the
union
repre...
the
employees
in
jackson
had
a
union.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i'm
sorry.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
the
13(c)
agreements
commit
the
recipients
of
federal
funds,
as
congress
intended
them
to
be
committed,
to
bargain
collectively
with
us.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
and
i
think
that
we
would
be
seeking
to
enforce
the
13(c)
agreement
which
has
a
provision
for
arbitration
of
disputes
over
its
terms.
so
that
if,
for
example,
the
transit
authority
said
no,
it's
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
or
we
were
bargaining
in
good
faith,
whatever,
then
we
would
have,
as
the
13(c)
agreements
provide,
a
dispute
over
whether
they
were
violating
the
terms
of
the
13(c)
agreement,
and
we
would
arbitrate
over
that.
but
that's
not
what
they
did
here.
they
took
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
they
had
signed,
the
same
way
that
they
had
signed
ordinary
collective
bargaining
agreements
for
ten
years,
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
union
informing
us
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
personal
to
the
personnel
director
whom
they
had
discharged.
now,
if
there's
one
thing
that
collective
bargaining
rights
means,
it
means
that
when
you
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
is
binding
on
the
parties
and
enforceable
by
them.
that
was
certainly
congress'
understanding
in
1964.
that
is
certainly
the
only
reasonable
understanding
of
the
language
of
the
act.
and
that
is
what
the
sponsor
of
the
act
said
about
collective
bargaining
rights
when
he
amended
the
preparatory
language
of
encouragement
to
make
collective
bargaining
rights
mandatory.
senator
morse
said
if
we
only
wanted
to
nudge
the
recipients
of
federal
grants
with
language
of
encouragement,
then,
he
said,
under
the
committee's
indefinite
language,
collective
bargaining
agreements
could
be
ignored
or
set
aside
by
systems
of
public
ownership.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
page
15
of
our
brief,
justice
burger.
so
that
we
know
i
think
from
the
passage
of
the
act
through
congress,
we
know
two
things.
first
of
all,
we
know
that
congress
was
not
intending
to
nudge
transit
authorities.
congress
was
intending...
and
they
had
that
option.
they
had
the
language
of
encouragement
of
collective
bargaining
in
an
early
version
of
the
bill.
they
took
it
out
and
they
fought
hard
over
taking
it
out.
and
one
of
the
justifications
that
senator
morse
gave
to
the
congress
for
strengthening
the
law
to
make
collective
bargaining
rights
mandatory,
not
just
encouraging
them,
was
that
the
scenario
that
you
have
heard
today
would,
under
the
old
language,
have
taken
place.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
we
have
both
issues,
your
honor,
whether
the
collective
bargaining
rights
preserved
to
the
employees
through
the
vehicle
of
13(c)
includes
the
common
understanding
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
enforceable
by
the
parties
to
them
in
federal
court.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
and
whether--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--federal
law
would
apply,
your
honor--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
the
second
option
that
congress
had
in
front
of
it
when
it
was
considering
section
13(c)
was
whether
to
subordinate
the
protections
of
section
13(c)
to
state
law,
and
they
rejected
that
option
five
times.
it
was
proposed
in
committee.
senator
tower
proposed
it
twice
on
the
senate
floor.
after
senator
morse--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--okay.
your
honor,
what
happens,
the
situation
that
congress
was
facing
was
the
dade
county
scenario
where
the
state
law
not
only
prohibited
collective
bargaining,
but
also
did
not
provide
the
employees
with
an
action
to
enforce
their
collective
bargaining
agreement,
so
that
when,
you
know,
to
understand
how
the
law
is
supposed
to
function
you
have
to
look
at
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
solve.
congress
was
trying
to
solve
the
dade
county
situation,
and
in
that
case
the
state
law
simply
did
not
provide
the
employees
with
an
action
to
enforce
their
collective
bargaining
agreement.
congress
said
if
there's
one
thing
we're
going
to
do
with
section
13(c),
it's
make
sure
that
federal
funds
do
not
fuel
repetitions
of
the
dade
county
scenario.
the
fact
that
the
law
of
a
particular
state
at
the
moment
that
the
grant
issues
is
or
is
not
hostile
to
the
federal
rights
that
congress
sought
to
protect,
it
seems
to
me,
is
largely
irrelevant.
should
this
court
require
an
example
of
a
situation
in
which
a
transit
authority
signs
13(c)
agreements
under
then
satisfactory
state
law
and
the
law...
the
state
then
changes
its
law,
the
first
circuit's
decision
in
division
589
v.
the
massachusetts
bay
transportation
authority
is
a
classic
example
of
that.
the
state
of
massachusetts
did
what
your
honors
were
asking
the
petitioner
about.
they
took
the
money
and
they
changed
their
law
in
a
way
which
affected
the
rights
set
forth
in
our
13(c)
agreement.
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
georgia
has
passed
a
similar
law.
it
is
awaiting
the
governor's
signature.
when
the
13(c)
agreements
are
remitted
to
state
court
for
enforcement,
a
host
of
unexpected
state
law
defenses
surfaces.
for
example,
in
georgia,
where
the
eleventh
circuit's
ruled
that
although
13(c)
agreements
must
be
honored,
the
honoring
of
them
must
be
honored,
and
that
their
contents,
the
federal
contents
are
assured
by
the
supervision
of
the
federal
secretary
of
labor,
actions
to
enforce
them
belong
in
the
state
courts.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
there
are
actually
three
agreements
at
issue
here,
your
honor.
there
is
a
grant
contract
with
the
united
states.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i
was
referring
to
the
labor
protective
agreement
entered
into
between
the
grant
recipient
and
the
union
representing
its
employees
which
congress
required
to
be
made
as
a
condition
of
the
receipt
of
federal
funds.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i
don't
have
it
with
me
at
this
moment,
your
honor,
but
i
am
sure
it
is.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
this
lawsuit
happens
to
enforce
both
agreements
because
in
this
case
the
transit
grant
recipient
both
abrogated
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
abrogated
the
13(c)
agreement
which
required
them
to
bargain
with
us
and
make
and
maintain
enforceable
collective
bargaining
agreements.
so
the
grant
recipient
violated
both.
this
case
really
presents
the--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--no,
the
national
labor
relations
act
operates
by
its
own
terms,
to
generate
a
process
of
collective
bargaining--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--right,
right.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
but
once
you
enter
into
it,
your
honor,
you're
bound
by
it.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
critical
collective
bargaining
right
which
we
are
seeking
to
enforce
here.
once
the
agreement
is
entered
into,
it
must
be
enforceable
by
the
parties
thereto.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances,
your
honor,
and
first
you
would
obviously
have
an
arbitration
question,
a
preliminary
arbitration
question.
but
the--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--right.
so
the
fact
that
tennessee
law
may
or
may
not
be
hostile
to
our
collective
bargaining
rights
in
this
instance
has
no
bearing
on
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
congress
didn't
write
a
law
that
said
you
will
have
13(c)
rights
but
only
in
those
states
where
the
law
is
hostile
to
collective
bargaining.
they
said
you
will
have
13(c)
rights.
if
a
transit
authority
wants
the
federal
money,
they
have
to
commit
themselves,
not
to
create
federal
labor
rights
for
you,
but
to
preserve
the
rights
that
you
had
before
the
federal
funding.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
do
not
contend
that
the
same
relationship
pertains.
there
is
a...
what
congress,
to
some
degree
faced
that
in
considering
section
13(c),
and
they
said
we
will
look
at
the
law
of
the
particular
state
that
applies
at
the
time
that
we're
thinking
about
giving
the
federal
funding,
and
the
employees
get
no
greater
rights
than
they
had
already.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
they
had,
in
that
case...
we
don't
have
that
case
here,
your
honor.
it's
an
inchoate
right,
in
a
sense,
to
organize,
but
that
certainly
is
very
far
from
what
we
have
here,
where
our
binding
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
torn
up
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
personal
to
the
personnel
director.
if
in
fact
tennessee
law
is
not
hostile
to
collective
bargaining,
then
theoretically
that
conduct
should
be
a
violation
of
state
law
as
well.
but
that's
not
what
we're
saying.
the
congress
did
not
create
a
need
system
whereby
federal...
the
employees
would
have
federal
rights
some
of
the
time
and
state
law
rights
others
of
the
time.
it
created
a
system
which
was
mandatory
in
its
terms,
not
encouragement
of
collective
bargaining
but
continued
collective
bargaining
rights,
and
does
not
subordinate
itself
to
the
doctrine
of
state
law.
the...
because
the
concept
of
collective
bargaining
rights
includes
the
concept
of
enforceable
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
they
were
understood
in
1964,
our
action
arises
under
federal
law
and
jurisdiction
in
this
court
would
be
proper
under
28
u.s.c.
1331
and
1337.
moreover,
the
13(c)
agreement
which
is
also
at
issue
here
is
a
contract
mandated
by
federal
law,
and
it's--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--i
think
that
13(c)
requires
that
if
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
concluded
between
the
parties,
that
the
parties
abide
by
them,
the
same
core
meaning
of
collective
bargaining
rights
that
congress
explicitly
adverted
to
in
passing
13(c).
if
you
make
an
agreement,
you
have
to
abide
by
it.
i
think
that
at
the
very
least
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that's
what
the
dade
county
abrogated
in
the
dade
county
scenario
which
congress
was
considering
at
the
time,
and
that
is
what
senator
morse
referred
to
explicitly
on
the
senate
floor.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
this
case
does
not
present
that
situation.
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
scheme
whereby
the
parties
would
attempt
to
negotiate
fair
and
equitable
labor
arrangements
between
them
that
they
could
live
with,
in
a
fashion...
the
model
for
which
is
the
interstate
commerce
act
labor
protective
arrangements.
so
they
thought
that
to
deal
with
particular
problems
the
parties
would
try
to
negotiate
a
fair
and
equitable
labor
arrangement
and
the
secretary
of
labor
would
supervise
the
terms
of
the
13(c)
agreement
to
be
sure
that
the
federal
statutory
interest
was
effectuated
by
it.
so
the
13(c)
agreement
is
not
only
required
by
federal
law,
its
contents,
its
federal
contents
are...
there
are
statutory
minimums,
and
remaining
questions
are
to
be
dealt
with
through
the
agency
of
negotiation
and
the
supervision
of
the
secretary.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
the
most...
many
section
13(c)
agreements
in
which
the
employees
are
transferred
from
private
to
public
and
lose
their
right
to
strike
because
congress
was
clear
that
that
was
one
thing
they
were
not
preserving
in
section
13(c),
provide
for
arbitration
of
the
terms
of
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
the
fair
and
equitable
arrangement
that
the
parties
have
arrived
at
as
a
substitution
for
economic
weapons
which--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--13(c)
requires
such
fair
and
equitable
labor
protective
arrangements
as
the
secretary
of
labor
determines.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well
the
13(c)
agreements,
where
there's
a
loss
of
strike
rights,
13(c)
agreements
almost
invariably
provide
for--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
the
law
requires
what
the
parties
negotiate
and
the
secretary
of
labor
certifies
as
a
fair
and
equitable
arrangement,
and
from
the
beginning
he
certified
such
arrangements
as
fair
and
equitable
as
the
statute
requires.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
if
the
particular
13(c)
agreement
which
was
a
condition
of
the
result
of
federal
funding
contained
a
provision
for
interest
arbitration,
then
the
transit
authority
would
be
bound.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
that
is
not
in
this
case.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
it
did
not
in
this
case.
all
we
want
is
that
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
should
be
abided
by
here.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
it
was...
i
believe
it
was
1975
to
1978.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
it
has,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
there
would
be
damages
because
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
were
were
unilaterally--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--and,
and...
well,
in
this,
on
the
complaint
as
it
existed
in
19...
as
it
was
filed
in
1976,
that's
where
we
are.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
but
the
transit
authority
here...
in
case
i
misspoke
myself,
justice
white,
the
transit
authority
here
in
another
case
is
party
to
a
13(c)
agreement
which
provides
for
interest
arbitration.
that
is
just
not
this
case.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
it
would
be
damages,
your
honor,
and
the...
and
that's
just
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
have
terms
and--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--right.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
it
would
be
the
difference
between
the
wages
and
benefits
that
we
were
paid
under
the
unilateral
terms
imposed
by
the
employer
and
the
collectively
bargained
terms
that
were
a
part
of
our
contract.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
it's
not
so
wide
as
a
church
nor
so
deep
as
a
well,
but'tis
enough;
'twill
serve.
i
think
we
would
be
happy
to
have
the
damages,
the
difference
between
our
agreement
that
we
negotiated
for
with
cost-of-living
adjustments
and
so
forth,
and
what
the
employer
chose
to
give
us
as
a
matter
of
his--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--it
was
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
right,
and
that
would
be
the
measure
of
our
damages.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
right,
right.
your
honors--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
you
had
a
particular
question
there.
that
agreement
was
an
agreement
between
the
grant
recipient
and
the
united
states,
not
between
the
grant
recipient
and
a
third
party.
congress
did
not...
this,
13(c)
is
rather
unusual.
it
is
far
from
a
garden
variety
federal
funding
statute.
it
is
modeled
on
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
operates
by
virtue
of
mandating
agreements
between
in
that
case
a
regulated
industry,
in
this
case
a
federal
grant
recipient,
and
their
employees,
and
those
agreements
congress
anticipated
would
be
enforced
by
the
parties
to
them
in
the
traditional
way
that
labor
agreements
are
usually
enforced.
so
that
this
is
not
the
same
contract
relationship
as
was
at
issue.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
right.
and
what
congress
sought
to
do
was
to
preserve
for
the
employees
here
the
other
structure
of
relationships
because
they
saw
what
happened
when
the
transit
employees
in
dade
county
were
transferred
to
that
system,
and
they
knew
that
the
federal
funding
which
did
in
fact
fuel
the
wholesale
transfer
out
of
the
private
sector
and
into
the
public
sector
of
transit--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--no.
all
that
13(c)
would
do
in
that
case
is
preserve
whatever
rights
the
employees
had
under
state
law
prior
to
the
federal
funding.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
the
13(c)
agreement
preserves
the
status
quo
for
the
employees.
that
is
a
federal
right.
the
substance
of
the
status
quo
was...
is
derived
from
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
federal
funding.
that
is
not
this
case.
this
is
the
classic--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
the...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
role
that
congress...
congress
was
rather
explicit.
it
said
all
we're
going
to
do
for
you
is
maintain
the
status
quo
so
that
we
will
guarantee
that
things
can't
get
worse
for
you,
but
we're
not
going
to
make
it
any
better,
so
that
if,
for
example,
there
were
a
state
whose
collective
bargaining
law
were
totally
unacceptable
to
the
federal
government,
they
could
just
refuse
to
fund.
but
the...
in
the
case
where
it
stays
public,
which
i
gather
is
your
question,
the
13(c)
agreements
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
merely
maintain
the
status
quo
as
it
existed
prior
to
the
federal
funding.
should
your
honors
choose
to
ignore
the
existence
in
this
case
of
a
traditional
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
13(c)
agreements
whose
making
is
mandated
by
federal
law,
and
treat
this
case
as
one
merely
for
enforcement
of
the
statute,
an
additional
basis
for
our
claim
here
is
provided
by
section
1983.
we
think
this
case
parallels
this
court's
decision
in
maine
v.
thiboutot.
there,
as
here,
the
federal
law
required
grant
recipients
to
make
arrangements
whose
contents
was
dictated
by
the
federal
statute.
it
was,
there
as
here,
it
was
a
condition
of
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
and
not
a
direct
mandate
like
the
railway
labor
act.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes,
and
i
do
say
that.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
we...
right,
we
get
to
the
same
place.
the
question
that--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
--well,
actually,
it
actually
is,
because
should
this
court
determine
that
the
statute
is
not
the
right
source
of
our
13(c)
agreement
rights,
we
would
still
have
rights
under
the
statute
directly.
there's
been
some
discussion
in
the
briefings
and
the
eleventh
circuit
adverted
to
the
point
that
somehow
our
rights
only
derived
from
the
13(c)
agreement
and
not
from
the
statute
itself,
and
should
this
court
determine
to
consider
only
the
statute,
you
would
not
have
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
for
us
there
because
the
public
body
here
made
a
commitment
to
the
federal
government,
just
like
in
maine
v.
thiboutot,
and
that...
the
violation
of
that
commitment
violates
the
federal
statute
mandating
the
commitment
to
be
made.
this
court
has
never
held
to
my
knowledge
that
the
mere
making
of
the
commitment
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
federal
statutory
mandate,
the
ink
still
being
wet
on
the
paper
and
thereafter
all
of
the
rights
contained
in
the
commitment
are,
if
you're
just
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
state
with
good
law.
in
maine
v.
thiboutot
the
state
executed
a
plan,
just
like
the
federal
statute
required,
containing
the
particular
payment
of
welfare
provisions
that
the
statute
required,
and
thereafter
when
the
beneficiaries
of
that
arrangement
came
to
enforce
it,
this
court
held
that
1983
created
a
claim
for
them.
in
sum,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
correctly
in
this
case,
and
we
believe
that
their
decision
should
be
affirmed.
