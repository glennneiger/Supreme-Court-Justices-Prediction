mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
directly
brings
before
the
court
today
the
provisions
of
the
urban
mass
transportation
act
of
1964
for
the
first
time.
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
today
is
whether
by
enacting
umta,
and
particularly
section
13(c)
thereof,
congress
silently
required
federal
courts
to
federalize
municipal
transit
labor
relations
over
federal
grant
recipients
by
creating
a
federal
common
law
to
resolve
public
sector
transit
labor
disputes
and
thereby
preempt
state
law.
in
the
first
instance,
the
district
court
in
this
case
answered
that
question
negatively.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
a
two-to-one
decision
reversed.
it
implied
a
federal
private
right
of
action
by
default.
since
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit,
another
circuit
court
has
reviewed
this
matter
comprehensively
and
ruled
to
the
contrary,
that
being
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
marta
case.
this
controversy
that
reaches
the
court
today
is
between
two
private
parties,
jackson
and
the
union.
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
there
are
no
federal
parties
presently
before
this
court,
and
the
substantive
outcome
of
this
controversy
requires
neither
construction,
interpretation
nor
vindication
of
umta.
additionally,
in
this
case
there
is
no
conflict
between
any
federal
interest
and
the
law
of
tennessee.
tennessee
law
clearly
establishes
collective
bargaining
between
municipalities
and
its
transit
workers.
the
outcome
of
this
case
will
have
no
substantive...
will
have
no
effect
on
the
substantive
rights
or
duties
of
the
united
states.
umta--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--well,
yes,
sir,
but
the
j.
i.
v.
borak
has
been
somewhat
cut
back
by
your
more
recent
decisions.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
but
there
was
a
direct
command
in
the
statutes
involved
in
those
cases
which
is
not
true
here,
as
i
will
point
out
in
a
moment.
i
might
point
out,
sirs,
that
umta
was
on
the
books
for
some
12
years
before
the
union
sought
to
utilize
the
federal
courts
to
bring
actions
such
as
this
nature.
this
was
one
of
the
first
attempts.
if
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
affirmed,
municipal
transit
labor
relations
will
be
decided
in
two
courts,
in
state
courts
as
well
as
federal
courts.
now,
the
events
in
this
case
are
somewhat
unique.
prior
to
1966,
for
approximately
20
some
odd
years,
there
was
a
private
transit
operator
in
jackson,
tennessee.
the
union
represented
the
transit
workers
in
that
community.
in
1966
the
jackson
transit
company,
as
was
happening
throughout
the
country
with
other
transit
systems,
went
defunct.
the
city,
in
its
judgment,
as
a
public
function,
took
over
the
operation
of
a
bus
system
containing
12
buses
and
18
unionized
employees.
jackson
filed
for
and
received
an
urban
mass
transportation
act
grant
in
the
amount
of
$275,000
to
assist
in
acquiring
12
new
buses
and
rehabilitating
its
maintenance
facilities.
as
part
of
the
grant
application
process
jackson
entered
into
what
is
commonly
known
as
a
section
13(c)
agreement
whereby
the
rights
of
the
workers
and
the
interests
of
the
workers
are
protected.
that
13(c)
agreement
was
certified
by
the
secretary
of
labor
as
creating
fair
and
equitable
arrangements
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
the
employees.
from
1966
through
1975,
jackson
and
the
union
entered
into
three
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
were
obviously
honored
since
there
was
no
litigation
between
the
parties.
in
1975
a
fourth
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
negotiated.
it
contained
a
cola
provision,
a
cost-of-living
escalator
which
is
the
underlying
basis
of
this
suit.
the
city,
after
the
execution
of
the
agreement,
found
that
it
had
never
been
properly
ratified
by
the
board
of
commissioners
and
refused
to
honor
the
cola,
and
sought
to
renegotiate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union.
the
union
declined.
it
first
demanded
of
the
secretary
of
labor
that
he
decertify
jackson
for
future
umta
grants.
the
union,
in
its
wisdom,
decided
to
try
to
make
a
federal
case
of
the
matter.
now,
did
congress,
in
light
of
the
aforegoing,
intend
for
the
federal
court
in
tennessee
to
create
and
apply
federal
common
law
to
this
contract
dispute
between
jackson
and
its
18
unionized
employees
as
a
result
of
this
single
umta
grant
made
some
ten
years
previously?
it
is
jackson's
position
that
the
answer
to
this
must
be
emphatically
no.
congress,
through
umta,
and
particularly
section
13(c),
did
not
intend
to
displace
the
traditional
public
policy
enunciated
in
both
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act
excluding
by
definition
state
and
political
subdivisions
from
all
obligations
of
the
labor-management
relations
act
in
order
that
local
governments
and
communities
regulate
and
manage
their
affairs
and
arrangements
with
their
own
employees
free
from
federal
interference,
control
and
federal
court
jurisdiction.
what
is
umta?
it
is
a
typical
federal
funding
statute
which
requires
at
the
time
of
federal
assistance
certain
conditions
be
met.
they
include
long
range
transit
plans
and
public
hearings
thereon,
special
efforts
for
the
elderly
and
handicapped,
environmental
impact
statements,
charter
bus
assurances
so
there
will
be
no
competition,
and
maximum
participation
by
operators
in
the
private
sector.
one
of
the
conditions
is
the
conditions
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
workers,
and
that
is
to
be
determined
by
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
he
must
certify
that
fair
and
equitable
arrangements
have
been
made
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
workers.
section
13(c)
did
not
create
federal
collective
bargaining
rights,
and
only
required
the
secretary
of
labor
during
the
application
process
to
look
at
state
law
and
determine
if
it
was
hostile
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
that
were
to
happen,
your
honor,
there
is
adequate
provision
in
umta
itself,
in
section
1602(f)
and
(g)
of
the
law,
the
secretary
is
instructed
to
bar
further
grants
to
those
communities
which
do
not
comply
with
their
grant
contracts.
there
is
a
cutting
off
of
funding
mechanism
built
right
into
the
act
itself.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
there
is
a
provision
that
the
secretary
can
enforce
agreements.
he
could
sue
on
his
agreement.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes,
sir.
but
this
is
where
we
have
a
private
party
attempting
to
go
in.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
the
law
would
be
govern--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--the
governing
law
would
be
the
law
of
contracts,
your
honor,
which
essentially
is
state
law.
there
is
no
federal
common
law
of
contracts.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
some
are
governed
by...
but
this
contract,
i
think,
would
be
governed
by
state
law,
and
let
me
explain
why
i
say
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
those
are
expressly
governed
because
congress
created
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
mandated
federal
law
apply.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
then,
this
court
said
it
did,
your
honor,
and
i
will
accept
that
correction.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor,
if
it
had...
in
this
particular
case
that
is
true,
but
that
wasn't
the
situation
under
which
umta
was--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--that's
true,
and
there's
also
provisions
i
believe
you
will
find
in
that
agreement,
if
it
is
unenforceable,
that
you
go
back
to
the
secretary
of
labor
for
new
types
of
arrangements.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
it's
highly
impractical
that
that
could
happen,
your
honor.
nobody--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--it
did
not
happen
here.
we
negotiated
three
collective
bargaining
agreements.
we
have
a
state
law
that
mandates
that
we
collectively
bargain.
the
tennessee
law
makes
a
positive
mandate
upon
us
to
do
so.
the
only
thing
that
we
did
here
is
we
said
that
this
agreement
had
not
been
properly
ratified.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
it
hadn't
been
properly
ratified,
there's
no
contract.
it's
a
typical
common
law
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
the
proper
formation
of
a
contract.
there
is
no
great
issue
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
state
action
anywhere
that
that
has
ever
happened,
and
why
i
believe
it
would
not
happen,
that
although
jackson
is
a
small
community
in
tennessee,
the
other
communities
in
tennessee
that
are
not
so
small
such
as
memphis
and
nashville
and
knoxville
and
chattanooga
are
not
going
to
have
their
federal
funding,
cut
off
because
jackson
decided
it
didn't
want
to
collectively
bargain
anymore.
as
a
practical
matter
what
happens
is
that
state
laws
have
been
adjusted
to
accommodate
the
situation
under
section
13(c),
not
the
reverse,
the
cutoff
situation.
the
federal--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
umta
act,
the
one
thing
that
comes
out
clear
in
the
legislative
history
was
that
once
a
grant
was
made,
there
should
be
as
little
federal
interference
as
possible.
there
were
two
concepts
before
the
congress
at
that
time,
to
have
loan
guarantees
on
one
hand
which
would
require
continuous
federal
monitoring,
and
on
the
other
hand
to
have
a
situation
where
all
the
documents
are
forwarded
and
judgement
is
made
whether
this
was
a
good
or
bad
project
to
be
funded.
once
it
was
funded,
they
would
go
on
and
look
at
the
next
project.
there
wasn't
to
be
that
type
of...
and
it
was
intentionally
not
to
be
that
continuous
type
of
monitoring
as
is
in
certain
other
programs
that
have
proved
disastrous
to
the
government.
your
honor,
we
can
always
speculate
it
could
have
happened.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
you
also
have
to
look
at
what
the
legislative
history
was
because
time
and
again
both
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
the
kennedy
administration,
the
floor
leader
of
the
bill,
senator
williams,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that
handled
the
bill,
senator
sparkman,
and
the
floor
proponent
of
the
bill,
senator
morse,
said
time
and
time
again
that
this
was
not
intended
to
supersede
state
law,
that
it
was
not
intended
to
override
state
law
or
preempt
state
law
in
any
way.
it
was
truly
to
encourage
states
to
adjust
their
laws,
modify
their
laws
to
have
collective
bargaining,
and
if
they
didn't,
they
wouldn't
get
the
funding.
i
think
probably
the
best
example
of
how
the
law
was
intended
to
work
is
in
the
city
of
macon
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
when
the
city
of
macon
refused
to
make
the
necessary
adjustments
to
make
its
laws
compatible
with
collective
bargaining,
after
the
secretary
used
all
kind
of
jawboning,
they
didn't
get
their
money.
and
that's
exactly
how
this
act
was
intended
to
work.
it
wasn't
intended
to
create
federal
collective
bargaining
rights.
i
have
serious
doubts
whether
it
could
have.
the
states
have
been
exempt
from
the
federal
labor
relations
laws
ever
since
the
inception
of
the
wagner
act.
time
after
time
there
have
been
proposals
before
the
congress
to
change
that.
and
they
have
been
defeated.
and
it
has
been
the
consistent
national
policy
to
leave
the
states'
handling
of
their
own
labor
relations
to
the
states
without
federal
interference
by
either
federal
administrative
bodies
such
as
the
nlrb,
or
the
federal
courts.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--it
would
be
governed
by
state
law.
that's
the
critical
point,
sir,
that
state
law
covers--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--no,
sir,
before
the
grant
is
approved
the
state
law
would
have
had
to
have
been
modified
in
order
to
make
it
compatible
with
the
continuation
of
collective
bargaining
and
therefore
to
get
the
money.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor,
i
don't
know
how
you
make
people
comply
with
the
law
that
sign
documents
that
they
are
going
to
comply
with
the
law,
that
pass
laws.
we
are
dealing
with
situations
that
have
never
happened,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
where
a
state
has
absolutely
repealed
its
law.
now,
we
do
have
situations
where
states
have
modified
their
laws,
and
there's
a
matter
that's
pending
before
you
on
cert
right
now
at
mbta
where
they
modified
their
laws
regarding
interest
arbitration,
but
it
didn't
end
collective
bargaining.
now,
as
i
said,
umta
is,
must
be
viewed
as
a
typical
federal
funding
statute
such
as
the
court
had
before
it
in
pennhurst,
and
its
purpose
was
not
to
create
federal
transit
relations.
its
purpose
was
to
salvage,
and
yes,
it
was
the
survival
of
a
badly
deteriorated
urban
mass
transit
industry
in
this
country.
it
was
structured
to
require
local
solutions
to
local
problems.
13(c)
arrangements
were
to
be
the
product
of
local
negotiation
and
bargaining.
neither
umta
nor
section
13(c)
contains
any
express
private
remedy.
if
one
exists,
it
exists
only
by
implication,
and
then
i
respectfully
submit,
not
warranted
under
the
circumstances
here.
it
is
clear
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
that
umta
was
to
meet
the
requirements
of
local
needs,
and
it
was
to
improve
the
mass
transit
facilities
in
order
to
facilitate
desirable
urban
renewal.
the
labor
protection
were
either
secondary
or
ancillary
to
the
main
purpose
of
this
act.
interestingly,
as
you
read
the
legislative
history,
the
reason
that
13(c)
even
became
an
issue
was
a
happening
that
you
suggest,
justice
stevens,
in
dade
county,
florida.
dade
county
had
a
private
transit
operator
in
the
early
'60s.
it,
too,
went
bankrupt,
and
dade
county
took
over
the
system.
because
of
state
law,
the
employees
lost
whatever
collective
bargaining
rights
they
had.
they
were
required
to
become
merit
system
employees,
and
they
couldn't
be
represented
by
a
union.
it
was
in
that
type
of
factual
background
that
the
unions
came
to
the
kennedy
administration
and
said
we
don't
want
federal
funds
to
be
used
to
defeat
the
workers'
rights
as
happened
in
dade
county.
congress
and
the
administration
had
three
choices
in
that
light.
the
first
was
to
have
full
federal
involvement
akin
to
the
railroad
and
airline
industries,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
in
other
words,
federalized
local
transit
labor
relations.
the
second
option
was
to
keep
hands
off
and
do
nothing.
and
the
third
option,
the
one
that
was
eventually
adopted,
was
the
carrot
and
stick
approach,
to
make
federal
funding
attractive
so
as
to
have
the
states
that
had
hostile
collective
bargaining
laws
to
either
modify
those
laws
or
work
out
some
innovative
arrangement
in
order
to
be
able
to
qualify
and
be
eligible
for
federal
assistance.
i
want
to
tell
you
why
that
is
particularly
important
in
the
light
of
what
was
happening
in
1963.
in
1963
the
major
transit
systems
had
already
gone
from
the
private
to
the
public
sector.
new
york
city,
chicago,
l.a.,
boston,
seattle,
oakland,
california,
cleveland,
just
to
name
a
few,
had
already
made
the
transition.
they
were
already
governed
by
state
law
procedures.
now,
if
that
was
the
case,
we
would
have
two
classes
of
systems,
those
who
were
later
going
to
fall
into
the
same
trend
and
who
were
still
governed
by
federal
law
at
that
time,
and
those
that
had
already
made
the
transition,
the
major
systems
that
needed
the
money
most
of
all.
i
don't
think
congress
ever
intended
to
have
two
classes.
they
intended
to
have
a
situation
to
make
it,
as
justice
rehnquist
said
in
the
pennhurst
case,
to
have
a
nudge,
an
ability
to
try
to
get
an
accommodation
with
state
law
so
it
would
not
be
hostile.
at
no
time
in
this
case
was
tennessee
law
antagonistic
to
what
was
intended
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes,
sir,
no...
and
that
is
the
word
that
is
used
in
the
statute
itself,
a
worsening.
they
would
be
no
worse
off.
you
know,
this
is
the
fourth
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
executed
between
jackson
and
its
workers.
it
wasn't
something
that
just
was
an
attempt
to
defeat
any
of
their
previously
existing
rights
or
benefits.
they'd
had
collective
bargaining.
they
had
a
longstanding
collective
bargaining
relationship.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
at
all
times
jackson
has
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
table,
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
they
urged
the
union
to
come
back
and
renegotiate
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
this
record.
it's
part
of
the
complaint.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
we
are
under
an
obligation
under
tennessee
law
to
do
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
to
collectively
bargain.
the
tennessee
law
is
explicit
on
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
sure
we're
under
an
obligation
to,
and
we've
never
backed
off
that
obligation.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
ma'am.
section
13(c)
creates
no
rights.
it
is
not
like
the
labor
railway
act
that
mandates
that
there
be
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
railroads
and
their
unions.
and
that
also
brings
me
to
a
very
interesting
point.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
creates
contract
rights.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes,
sir.
state
courts
traditionally
handle
dispute--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--if
there
were
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
correct.
that's
the
absolute
bottom
line
of
this
dispute.
it's
the
enforcement
of
a
contract.
i'd
like
to
point
out
before
i
sit
down
and
reserve
my
time
one
very
important
element.
when
this
matter
was
before
the
congress
the
union,
through
its
representatives,
presented
to
both
the
house
and
senate
committee
a
proposal,
a
proposal
which
would
have...
and
i'm
going
to
quote...
"required
protective
arrangements
which
shall
include,
without
being
limited
to,
enforceable
provisions
requiring.
"
and
i'm
skipping,
"the
right
of
the
employees
to
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
concerning
wages,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment,
and
ensuring
the
right
and
duty
of
the
employees'
bargaining
agent
and
the
employer
to
make
and
maintain
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
ensuring
the
existence
of
authority
for
any
employer
and
the
bargaining
representatives
of
the
employees
to
enter
into
enforceable
arbitration
agreements.
"
very
rigid,
mandatory
requirements,
similar
to
the
railway
labor
act.
the
congress
rejected
this
proposal.
it
wanted
not
to
impose
these
type
of
requirements
on
the
municipalities.
it
wanted
state
law
wherever
it
was,
where
it
existed,
if
it
was
not
hostile
to
federal
law,
to
govern
the
situation.
and
that
is
our
position
before
this
court
today.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
court
understands
what
this
case
is
about
now.
it's
a
case
to
collect
the
difference
between
the
amount
that
the
union
claims
was
due
under
the
1975
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
what
they
say
they
have
been
paid.
it's
a
claim
for
damages
to
enforce
nothing
more
than
a
garden
variety
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
no
federal
right.
there
is
no
federal
law
to
be
vindicated
here.
and
it
does
not
hinge
on
the
interpretation
of
any
federal
statute.
picking
up
where
i
left
off
before,
we
would
have
the
most
anomalous
system
where
the
large
cities
such
as
new
york,
cleveland,
los
angeles,
chicago
and
boston
would
be,
having
13(c)
arrangements,
would
be
under
one
system
and
smaller
communities
such
as
jackson
would
be
under
another
system
merely
because
of
the
events
that
caused
the
transition
from
the
private
sector
to
the
public
sector.
i
don't
think
congress
ever
envisioned
any
such
situation
as
that
is
now
proposed.
many
states,
including
new
york,
for
example,
have
long
had
the
taylor
law
on
their
books
which
handle
situations
with
their
local
transit
workers,
and
handled
them
well,
and
handled
the
situation
that
has
been
talked
about
in
unfair
labor
practice.
these
have
always
been
in
the
state
court
and
state
law
well,
and
just
as
jackson
should
be.
my
colleague
would
have
this
court
import,
or
insert,
municipal
labor
relations
insofar
as
only
transit
workers
are
concerned
silently
by
the
incorporation
of
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
into
section
13(c).
not
one
congressman,
not
one
senator,
and
not
one
word
in
the
debates
would
ever
lead
you
to
that
conclusion.
no
one
urged
that.
and
i
might
point
out
that
has
never
been
urged
in
any
lower
court
in
this
proceeding,
and
for
the
first
time
has
been
urged
in
this
court.
now,
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
enforceable,
but
if,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
teachers
have
a
violation
of
their
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it's
solved
under
state
law
pursuant
to
the
exemption
of
the
wagner
and
taft-hartley
acts,
and
so
it
should
be
for
transit
workers.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
there's
express
federal
jurisdiction
under
1345,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
governed
by
probably
a
hybrid
of
federal
and
state
law
in
that
case,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
thank
you,
your
honor.
