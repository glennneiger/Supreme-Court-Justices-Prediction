justice
john
paul
stevens
were
any
statements
taken
from
them
before
they
were
released?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happened
to
the
statement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
fact
there
is
no
written
or
recorded
statement
from
those
released?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
did
you
get
--
when
did
they
get
the
statement
from
morales?
sometime
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
would
--
how
would
anybody
have
made
that
proffer
if
--
could
never
have
a
--
if
there
was
no
opportunity
to
chat
with
those
witnesses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
was
--
i
think
he
was
but
his
lawyer
never
had
a
chance
to
--
to
talk
with
him,
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
be
so
but
the
respondent
probably
didn't
know
what
he
was
--
that
a,
he's
going
to
charged
or
b,
what
he's
going
to
be
charged
with
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
or
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
hardly
--
that's
hardly
equivalent
to
--
that's
hardly
equivalent
to
knowing
what
the
witnesses
would
have
said
in
response
to
questions
from
the
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
--
your
first
submission
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
government
should
be
relied
on
to
decide
whether
a
witness
has
anything
relevant
that
might
help
the
defendant.
that's
a
very
strange
submission,
isn't
it?
i
thought
defendants
usually
decide
what
--
what's
the
point
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
say
that
--
would
you
say
that
if
you
interviewed
them
and
you
thought
there
was
something
helpful
to
the
defendant
that
you
can
nevertheless
deport
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
you've
got
a
power
to
deport.
just
deport.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
deport
them
without
talking
to
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
already
talked
to
them
because
you
want
to
get
a
witness
for
yourself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
--
you
interviewed
the
--
you
interviewed
the
people
because
you
need
witnesses
yourself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
were
you
referring
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
no
response
and
no
counter
offer.
will
you
please
stipulate
that
if
they
recall
they
would
testify
as
follows?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
hurt
you
much
then
if
you
lost
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't
hurt
you
much
then
if
you
lost
this
case
in
the
sense
that
the
next
case
where
the
tape
recorded
statement
would
be
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
suppose
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
a
counsel
would
always
be
appointed
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
within
24
hours
after
arrest
or
48
hours
after
arrest.
and
the
rule
was
that
you
should
--
that
you
should
give
counsel
one
day
and
then
you
can
deport
witnesses.
now,
you
would
have
to
hold
all
these
people
for
three
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
be
in
no
different
position
than
you
would
be
if
--
if
somehow
this
alien,
this
defendant
had
a
--
had
a
lawyer
within
the
room
when
he
was
arrested
and
he
went
around
and
he
subpoenaed
all
these
witnesses.
what
would
you
do
with
him
then,
deport
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
just
one
of
those
--
one
of
those
problems
about
what
the
government
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
wouldn't
deport
him,
i
don't
suppose.
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess
that
i
still
find
some
difficulty
in
understanding
what
their
testimony
could
have
done
to
help
the
particular
case
even
if
they
had
said
they
had
been
in
the
great
vineyards
four
years
ago.
there's
no
presumption
they've
been
in
the
united
states
continuously
since
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you're
foreclosed
on
a
remand
if
you
lose
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
kind
of
a
showing
must
he
make?
what
if
he
says,
for
example,
all
of
these
people
were
in
the
vehicle
and
i'd
like
to
hold
them
all
because
they
might
conceivably
benefit
the
defense?
is
that
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
standard
of
that
hearing
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
he
say
at
that
hearing
what
the
exculpatory
evidence
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
been
a
better
case
if
morales
or
whatever
his
name
was
when
he
was
put
on
the
stand
had
said,
“yes,
i
told
the
defendant
that
i
had
been
--
that
i
was
an
illegal
alien
and
that
i
had
been
here
for
only
two
days.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
suppose
he
had
to
testify
that
way,
would
you
be
here
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
morales
really
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
might
--
he
might
be
lying
because
he's
getting
a
break
from
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
hear
him.
did
that
mean
that
there
weren't
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
certainly
acting
at
your
peril
now.
you
don't
say
that
you
can
just
--
well,
i
guess
you
do.
your
submission
really
is
that
if
you
--
once
you
interview
them
and
that
government
makes
a
decision
that
they
would
have
no
exculpatory
evidence
that
you
can
deport
them
and
--
and
as
long
as
you
act
in
good
faith,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
no
matter
what
the
showing
is
on
the
other
side.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
first
submission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
ever
had
the
court
agree
with
you
on
that,
that
first
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
one
has
ever
--
you
say
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
you
make
a
good
faith
judgment
that
even
though
they
were
present
on
the
spot,
that
they
would
have
no
evidence,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
showing
the
other
side
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
we
rejected
that,
what's
your
next
fallback?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
and
is
--
is
that
rule
extended
in
any
circuit
that
you
know
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that's
the
rule
the
fifth
circuit
adapts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
--
so,
if
you
would
be
acting
at
your
peril
in
deporting
witnesses
under
the
fifth
circuit
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
regularly
take
that
risk
in
the
fifth
circuit
now,
or
do
you
hold
everybody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
--
under
the
fifth
circuit
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
rule
is
not
that
different
from
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
you
don't
think
it's
so
strict
that
you
can't
take
that
risk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
somebody's
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
--
my
question
really
is
that
if
you
are
--
if
you
don't
--
if
we
do
not
agree
with
your
first
submission,
would
the
government
regularly
--
and
i
suppose
you
had
to
operate
under
the
fifth
circuit
rule
--
would
the
government
regularly
release
a
lot
of
witnesses
that
it
would
not
release
under
the
ninth
circuit
rule?
