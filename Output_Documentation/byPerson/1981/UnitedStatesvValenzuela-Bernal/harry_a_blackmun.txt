justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
the
respondent
represented
and
did
the
prosecutor
know
that
at
the
time
they
were
released?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
was
not
represented?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ultimately,
did
--
was
he
represented
by
a
retained
or
appointed
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
apart
from
that,
mr.
phillips,
i
gather
or
perhaps
i
better
put
it
as
a
question,
do
you
think
the
--
they
could
have
been
released
had
counsel
in
fact
been
appointed
before
they
were
released?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
--
no,
i
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
would
the
government's
case
be
in
any
trouble
if
you
did
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mean
there's
no
messiah
overtone
after
a
counsel
is
appointed
to
whether
or
not
you
could
--
may
release
them?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
--
the
fifth
is
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
strikes
me
as
out
of
line
with
the
ninth
circuit's
approach.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
just
objecting
to
your
saying
that
this
circuit
has
followed
the
ninth.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
he
--
did
he
saying
anything
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
that
he
quotes
either
the
two
who
had
been
deported?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
he
asked
any
questions
about
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
there
any
question
--
well,
did
you
--
did
the
driver
have
any
conversation
with
the
two
deported
aliens?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
gather
what
you
said
earlier,
mr.
iredale,
was
that
one
of
them
might
have
said
in
the
hearing
in
presence
of
the
driver
and
this
(inaudible),
might
have
said
--
up
in
the
great
country
three
years
ago
and
even
though
he
denied
that
they
had
said
anything,
they
might
have
come
and
testified
that
they
did
indeed
say
something.
and
that's
what
was
said,
and
your
point
is
that
this
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
knowledge
of
the
defendant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
did
he
answer?
