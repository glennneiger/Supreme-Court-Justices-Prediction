mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
address
four
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
first
is
the
issue
of
what
the
statute
with
which
mr.
valenzuela
was
charged
required
for
proof
of
conviction
and
what
the
defense
in
the
case
was.
secondly,
the
way
in
which
the
government's
action
in
this
case
violated
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
compulsory
process.
third,
what
the
actual
procedure
is
in
the
southern
district
of
california
in
implementing
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
mendez-rodriguez,
a
decision
that
has
been
adapted
by
the
circuits
--
of
the
three
other
circuits,
the
fifth,
the
seventh,
and
recently
in
armijo-martinez,
the
sixth.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
mr.
justice
blackmun,
as
we
talk
about
that
in
the
brief,
the
original
decision
was
avila-dominguez.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
deportation
of
the
witnesses
before
an
interview
is
a
violation
of
due
process,
the
sanction
for
which
is
dismissal.
however,
they
said
we
reject
the
automatic
dismissal
rule.
the
ninth
circuit
of
course
does
not
have
an
automatic
dismissal
rule.
and
in
a
subsequent
case
(inaudible),
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
standard
is
that
the
defense
in
order
to
obtain
relief
must
show
either
a
plausible
theory
or
some
slight
suggestion
concerning
which
the
witnesses
could
have
helped.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
whether
you
call
it
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
--
i
should
say
that
with
the
exception
--
to
our
mind,
the
difference
between
the
terms
plausible
theory
or
some
slight
suggestion
and
the
ninth
circuit
formulation
of
conceivable
benefit
is
a
matter
of
semantics.
but
i
think
you're
correct
that
there
is
some
difference
in
the
formulation
of
the
test
although
the
fifth
has
held
that
deportation
in
this
context
violates
compulsory
process.
finally,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
government's
proposal
and
why
it
would
strike
at
the
heart
of
the
adversary
process,
which
is
the
basis
for
our
criminal
justice
system.
the
respondent
was
charged
in
this
case
with
a
violation
of
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
requires
that
the
defendant
show
some
conceivable
benefit
could
have
been
gained
from
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
in
the
district
court,
the
defendant
submitted
an
exhibit.
we
actually
tried
to
subpoena
these
witnesses.
we
obtained
the
addresses
in
mexico,
mailed
them
subpoenas
although
of
course,
the
subpoenas
have
no
force
outside
the
geographical
limits
of
the
united
states
except
with
respect
to
united
states
citizens.
we
also
mailed
a
parole
letter,
which
was
countersigned
by
the
u.s.
attorney
authorizing
the
witness,
should
the
witness
choose
to
attend
court
entering
to
the
united
states;
the
parole
is
the
permit
to
let
him
in.
and
finally,
we
sent
a
letter
to
each
of
the
witnesses
in
these
cases
which
was
submitted
as
an
exhibit
at
the
hearing
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
in
each
of
the
letters,
the
counsel
in
the
case
wrote
to
the
witness,
“your
testimony
regarding
any
conversations
that
occurred
between
mr.
valenzuela,
yourself
and
other
occupants
of
the
vehicle
is
important
in
the
case
of
mr.
valenzuela.
further,
your
physical
appearance
on
the
date
of
the
arrest
and
any
information
you
provided
or
did
not
provide
to
mr.
valenzuela
concerning
your
illegal
status
and
time
and
place
of
illegal
entry
in
the
united
states
is
important
to
the
issues
of
guilt
or
innocence.”
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
your
honor.
had
they
been
held?
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
in
mexico?
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
dollars
and
the
logistical
difficulty,
otherwise,
i
believe
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
that
jalisco
was
about
800
to
1000
miles
away
and
the
other
witness
was
in
another
province.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
unless
the
deposition
could
be
taken
before
the
police
have
witnesses
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
it
is
because
the
exhibit
was
introduced
as
an
exhibit.
it's
in
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
albeit
not
in
the
joint
appendix
before
this
court.
but
their
address,
la
huerta,
jalisco
for
one
of
the
witnesses
and
the
other
address
in
another
state
in
mexico
is
in
the
record.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no,
your
honor,
there
was
also
a
statement
in
argument
by
counsel
that
we
wanted
the
witnesses
because
we
felt
that
they
could
possibly
testify
in
such
a
way
as
he
might
be
found
not
guilty
of
a
crime
of
knowingly
transporting
aliens.
and
then
this
followed
a
colloquy
when
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
on
the
stand
in
which
the
questions
were
asked
which
set
forth
the
defense
in
this
case,
the
defense
which
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
in
this
opinion.
one
of
the
elements
of
illegal
transportation
of
aliens
is
that
a
person
has
to
have
reasonable
grounds
knowing
that
the
people
came
into
the
united
states
within
the
last
three
years.
the
prosecutor
answered
that's
correct.
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
that
that
was
the
basis
or
conceivable
benefit.
in
other
words,
we
showed
both
in
the
district
court
and
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
these
witnesses
could
have
proffered
evidence
that
would
have
been
relevant
to
the
defense.
what
was
that
defense?
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
and
because
we
didn't
have
the
witnesses,
we'll
never
be
able
to
know
for
sure.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
would
not
be,
i
would
suggest,
an
appropriate
procedure.
first
of
all
is
the
fact
that
the
--
as
a
general
matter,
the
defendant
may
not
have
himself
knowledge
of
the
relevant
evidence
that
can
be
given
by
the
witnesses.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
has
the
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
testify.
there's
no
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
but
the
point
is
i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
some
immunity
in
the
simmons
context
that
the
defendant
could
get
up
on
the
stand
or
submit
an
affidavit
which
could
later
be
used
--
parts
of
which
could
later
be
used
at
the
trial
and
the
case
in
chief
to
convict
him,
and
that
would
be
an
inappropriate
showing.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
and
none
of
the
other
circuits
have
ever
made
a
requirement
that
the
defendant
himself
make
a
showing.
the
issue
is
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
i
understand.
i
think
the
appropriate
test
would
be
not
to
require
the
defendant
to
come
forth
and
make
any
showing
but
to
allow
his
counsel
by
statement
or
by
some
indication
as
to
the
possible
defense
to
show
how
these
witnesses
could
have
helped
were
they
here,
and
that's
what
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
may
or
may
not
depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
that's
my
point,
justice
o'connor.
it's
not
clear
whether
there
would
be
a
simmons
protection,
in
other
words,
whether
that
could
not
be
used
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
it
has
never
been
raised.
and
so,
because
there
was
no
such
requirement
in
this
case,
counsel
would
have
in
effect
been
risking,
allowing
his
client
to
get
on
the
stand.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
as
to
the
showing,
as
to
the
showing
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
think
it
could
be
except
that
it
would
trench
on
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent.
i
think
the
rule,
which
we
have,
is
an
appropriate
one
which
is
counsel
must
show
given
the
facts
and
the
law
and
the
statute
involved
that
these
witnesses
could
conceivably
because
we'll
never
know
for
sure
what
they
would
have
had.
they
could
have
given
evidence
that
would
have
helped
this
case.
now,
let
--
let
me
just
address
this
because
the
government
seems
to
say,
“this
defendant
was
so
guilty,
it
doesn't
matter.”
well,
certainly,
there
was
no
question
that
he
transported
the
persons,
that
one
of
them
in
fact
was
an
alien
and
given
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government,
possibly
even
that
he
knew
of
his
illegal
status.
but
8
u.s.c.
1324(a)(2),
the
statute
employed
in
this
case,
requires
that
the
defendant
know
that
the
alien
had
entered
illegally
within
the
last
three
years
before
the
transportation.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
the
testimony
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
was
that
he
did
not
enter
with
mr.
valenzuela;
that
he
met
mr.
valenzuela
at
a
house
in
escondido,
which
is
some
50
miles
north
of
the
border.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
the
witness,
mr.
valenzuela,
the
indication
was
from
his
statement
who
had
been
in
the
country
six
years,
the
witness
had
been
in
the
country
between
a
day
and
a
half
and
possibly
as
little
as
12
hours
when
he
arrived
at
the
house
in
escondido.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
denied
any
communication
whatsoever,
one
way
or
the
other.
and
the
point,
of
course,
is
that
although
he
was
the
one
witness
that
the
government
chose
to
charge
the
other
witnesses
were
apparently
in
his
company,
and
it
is
conceivable
that
these
witnesses
would
have
said
something
to
mr.
valenzuela
such
as
for
instance,
one
saying
to
the
other
in
his
presence,
“do
you
remember
when
we
were
up
in
the
imperial
valley
three
years
ago
picking
those
grapes?”
which
would
indicate
to
valenzuela
that
albeit
without
illegal
status,
they
had
not
in
fact
illegally
entered
the
country
within
the
last
three
years
because
as
this
court
recognizes,
i
think,
in
brignoni-ponce.
the
hispanic
population
of
southern
california
is
large
and
in
fact
there
are
large
numbers
of
people
illegally
there
who
have
been
there
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
was
charged
with
transporting
romero-morales,
the
one
witness
who
remained.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that
was
my
point,
justice
white.
the
point
is
that
these
witnesses
apparently
got
in
the
car
with
romero
as
a
group.
and
so,
the
relevant
issue
is
not
in
fact
what
the
case
is
but
what
valenzuela's
state
of
mind
is.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
correct.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
about
their
own
particular
status,
that's
correct.
but
the
issue
is
the
--
the
factual
setting
is
such
that
anything
--
any
one
of
the
witnesses
could
have
said
to
the
other.valenzuela
could
have
perceived
that
they
were
there
together,
that
they
were
friends,
that
they
were
in
the
same
status
and
what
was
true
as
to
one
was
true
as
to
the
other.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
and
as
to
that
particular
element
of
the
offense,
the
government's
proof
was
deficient.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
denies
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no,
sir.
he
did
not.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
the
question
that
was
put
to
him
was,
“did
you
have
any
conversation
with
him?”
and
the
answer
was
no.
but,
of
course,
in
order
to
crosscheck
to
see
if
that
was
a
correct
statement
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i'm
not
sure
if
that
question
was
put
or
not.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
we
called
him
as
a
witness
at
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
what
was
that
conversation?
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
but
the
--
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
the
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
they
could
have
--
they
could
have
been
of
help
in
another
way.
for
instance,
if
in
fact
these
witnesses
--
romero-morales
was
not
necessarily
telling
the
truth,
one
or
more
of
those
witnesses
could
have
been
in
the
united
states,
could
have
been
involved
in
smuggling
romero
or
could
have
in
fact
been
legally
within
the
united
states.
we
don't
know
absent
talking
to
those
witnesses.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
it's
the
question
is
whether
those
witnesses
could
help
with
respect
to
the
charge
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
absolutely.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
or
something
that
the
defendant
could
have
inferred
related
to
romero
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--
or
to
the
group
of
them
because
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
given
the
rule
of
law,
as
it
exists
and
the
fact
that
any
such
requirement
may
well
trench
on
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent,
i
would
submit
that
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
a
proffer
through
counsel
when
such
a
proffer
was
made.
the
proffer
was
made
that
these
witnesses
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no,
no.
the
proffer
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no.
the
issue
was
raised
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
your
honor,
assuming
that
valenzuela
remembered
accurately
what
happened,
and
assuming
that
he
trusted
his
lawyer
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
and
if
the
witnesses
aren't
there
to
help
him,
god
help
him.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that's
the
problem.
i
can't
tell
you,
justice
marshall,
what
they
would
have
testified
to
because
they
weren't
there.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
wasn't
the
lawyer
in
the
court
below.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
don't
know,
justice
marshall.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
because
the
witnesses
aren't
there.
all
the
government
would
have
had
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
hold
them
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
they
were
translated
in
spanish,
justice
marshall,
and
the
spanish
was
sent
to
them.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
and
both
letters
came
back,
marked
“no
está
aquí,”
this
person
is
not
here.
we
couldn't
subpoena
the
witnesses.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
agree,
but
the
issue
is
not
what
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government,
the
evidence
would
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well
it
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
what
valenzuela
could
have
argued
through
his
counsel
to
a
jury
is,
sure,
he
knew
they
were
illegally
here,
he
knew
he
was
illegally
here,
but
there
was
no
basis
for
him
knowing.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
many
of
the
people
who
are
illegally
in
california
go
from
southern
california
where
they
work
up
to
the
north
and
they
have
to
get
through
the
checkpoint.
and
then,
they
come
back
down
south
and
work
in
the
south
and
then
they
go
back
up
north
without
necessarily
entering
back
into
mexico.
and
he
could
have
inferred
that
or
believed
that
that
was
the
situation
here;
even
though
admittedly,
he
knew
they
were
without
status,
he
could
have
inferred
they
were
coming
not
from
mexico
but
from
the
imperial
valley
up
to
the
central
valley
to
pick
crops
there.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
would
say
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that
he
--
it
could
be
argued
first
of
all
that
he
had
some
knowledge
of
their
illegal
status
in
the
united
states.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
but
was
argued
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--
by
the
government.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that
they
were
illegal
--
that
he
knew
they
were
illegally
in
the
united
states?
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
but
that
didn't
go
to
the
three-year
element.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no,
he
was
convicted
in
the
court
below.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
was
convicted
in
the
court
below,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
conviction
in
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that's
correct.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
there
was
no
issue
raised
as
to
that.
the
only
issue
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that
was
not
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
relied
on
mendez-rodriguez
solely.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
knew
he
was
going
to
be
arrested.
he
knew
there
were
people
illegally
in
the
country
who
were
in
his
car.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
but,
he
supposed
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
but
the
statute
has
two
mandatory
of
requirements.
one
is
that
he
knows
they
are
illegaly
here.
the
second
is
that
he
knows
they
entered
within
three
years,
and
i
think
that
statement
goes
to
the
first.
the
government
can
argue
it
goes
to
the
second,
but
that's
the
issue
in
dispute
in
the
case.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
it
--
it
was
never
raised
because
we
felt
the
mendez-rodriguez
issue
was
absolutely
all
in
our
favor
and
we
wanted
to
raise
that
issue
only.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
would
hope
not.
i
would
hope
we
would
not
lose
the
case
given
the
fact
that
we
feel
that
the
procedure
here
followed
by
the
government
was
completely
unreasonable,
especially
in
light
of
the
practices
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
this
would
testify
two
in
the
record.
now,
i'd
like
to
explain
it
because
i
have
a
very
reasonable
effort
to
balance
all
of
the
interests
of
all
of
the
parties.
when
the
defendant
is
arrested
and
charged
with
an
offense
involving
felony
illegal
alien
smuggling,
he's
bought
in
to
court,
almost
always
within
24
hours
of
the
arrest.
at
the
rule
five
arraignment
counsel
is
appointed
for
him,
counsel
is
also
at
that
time
appointed
for
the
witnesses.
a
date
is
set
for
preliminary
examination
which
is
nearly
always
within
10
days
of
the
date
of
the
initial
appearance
in
court.
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
there's
nothing
magical
about
the
10-day
figure
and
it's
not
common
law.
the
reason
why
it's
10
days
is
because
the
government
wants
10
days
to
be
able
to
indict
the
case.
defense
counsel
franklin
could
conduct
his
investigation
in
much
less
time.
it
is
the
practice
in
the
southern
district
of
california
that
the
government
provides
discovery,
the
reports
to
defense
counsel
on
an
informal
basis
and
the
witnesses
are
all
interviewed
before
that
initial
appearance.
and
at
that
appearance,
after
the
interview
of
the
witnesses
has
taken
place,
counsel
appears
with
the
defendant,
the
government
is
required
at
that
time
to
make
a
showing
as
to
which
witnesses
they
want.
defense
counsel
is
required
to
make
a
showing
as
to
which
if
any
witnesses
he
wants.
in
one
magistrate's
code,
it
must
be
done
by
an
affidavit
under
oath
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that's
--
that's
insufficient.
you
see,
the
standard
of
conceivable
benefit
does
not
apply
at
these
hearings
because
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
the
standard
--
the
defendant
must
be
able
to
show
that
the
witness
could
offer
relevant,
material
and
exculpatory
evidence
that
would
not
otherwise
be
obtainable
from
the
witnesses
that
the
government
is
keeping.
in
other
words,
counsel
is
held
at
that
hearing
to
a
very
specific
standard.
the
reason
is
he
has
been
able
to
interview
these
witnesses.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
your
honor.
he's
required
to
because
absence
such
a
showing,
the
magistrate
will
order
the
discharge
of
the
witness
immediately.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
this
hearing
probably
50%
to
60%
of
the
witnesses
are
discharged.in
every
case,
the
government
keeps
material
witnesses
in
custody.
even
if
this
court
were
to
adhere
to
the
government's
position,
the
number
of
material
witnesses
to
retain
in
the
southern
district
of
california
would
not
decrease.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
justice
rehnquist,
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
a
verbatim
record
is
kept
of
the
magistrate's
proceedings.
and
defense
makes
his
proffer,
the
government
may
oppose
it,
the
magistrates
rule,
and
then
it
would
be
presented
to
the
district
court
for
his
resolution
of
the
issue.
but
the
point
is
at
this
material
witness
hearing,
the
defense
can
properly
be
held
to
that
high
standard
that
they
are
held
to.
we're
not
allowed
to
come
in
and
say,
“oh,
well,
maybe
he
could
help.
we
don't
know
exactly.”
because
we've
had
the
chance
to
interview,
the
defense
is
required
at
that
hearing
to
show
specifically.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that's
absolutely
correct,
but
the
witnesses
ordered
release
at
that
time,
if
the
magistrates
still
hold
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
that's
exactly
right,
and
that
would
properly
be
held.
in
other
words,
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
understand
correctly,
what
you're
saying
is,
given
the
interview,
then
the
defense
would
have
to
make
a
specific
particularized
definite
concrete
exculpatory
showing.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
let
me
just
say
i
hesitated
the
formulation
of
a
day
because
depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
a
reasonable
time
might
be
necessary.
you
might
need
to
see,
for
instance,
in
order
to
interview
intelligently,
you
need
to
know
what
the
government
is
going
to
charge.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
a
reasonable
time,
given
the
reasonable
time
and
adequate
opportunity
to
know
what
the
government
is
going
to
charge.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
assuming
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
investigation
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
absolutely.
that
would
--
then
it
would
be
appropriate,
because
then
you
would
be
in
a
position
to
say
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
then
it's
waiver.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
either
--
for
a
brief
period
of
time,
yes.for
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
three,
four,
five
days.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
only
to
allow
an
interview.
it
could
be
a
summary.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
in
washington
versus
texas,
this
court
hold
--
held
that
the
government
violates
compulsory
process
when
it
makes
unavailable
to
the
defense
or
prevents
from
testifying
a
witness
who
is
an
eye
witness
to
an
event
and
who
is
physically
and
mentally
able
to
testify
about
events
which
he
personally
witnessed
which
are
relevant
to
the
defense.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
mr.
justice
burger,
this
case
isn't
a
typical
case.
the
government
chose
this
case
as
its
so
called
“test
case”
so
they
chose
the
facts
they
felt
would
be
most
favorable
to
them.
in
most
of
these
cases,
the
issue
is
not
knowledge
but
in
many
cases,
alibi,
mistaken
identity,
and
in
fact,
who
is
doing
what
with
whom
and
to
whom.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
it
would
have
been
a
very
good
case.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
because
those
other
witnesses
could
have
testified
that
morales
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no,
that
he
was
lying.
that
morales
was
the
man
who
was
--
who
was
the
smuggler,
which
is
what
happens
sometimes
in
these
cases.
it's
hard
to
tell
the
smuggler
sometimes
from
the
witnesses,
which
is
why
counsel
is
appointed
for
them.
the
point,
i
think,
is
that
the
government
cannot
accurately
or
fairly
determine
--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
all
of
these
witnesses
are
subject
to
prosecution,
and
all
of
them
are
interviewed
initially
by
the
border
patrol.
i
thank
the
court.
