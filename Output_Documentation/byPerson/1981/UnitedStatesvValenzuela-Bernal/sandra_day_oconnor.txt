mr.

--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
i
assume
the
government
could
have
prosecuted
the
witnesses
who
were
deported
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
for
a
criminal
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
the
general
practice
not
to
do
that
and
to
simply
deport
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
what
is
the
government's
main
concern,
saving
the
--
the
cost
involved
in
maintaining
these
witnesses
in
jail
over
a
long
period
of
time
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
various
alternatives
suggested
by
the
respondents
that
might
alleviate
the
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
an
early
interview
at
which
defense
counsel
has
an
opportunity
to
be
present
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
before
release?
justice

mister
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
iredale,
could
the
defendant
not
testify
for
purposes
of
the
hearing
only
and
preserve
his
right
not
to
testify
at
trial
and
not
have
it
used
against
him
as
much
as
we
would
have
happen
at
other
pretrial
hearings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
has
not
been
tested
to
your
knowledge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
certainly,
that
would
be
one
possibility,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
the
showing
of
possible
prejudice,
wouldn't
that
be
a
possibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
--
i
believe
counsel
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
indicated
that
even
if
the
government
won
this
decision,
it
wouldn't
alter
the
number
of
witnesses
retained.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
suggestion
that
the
witnesses
be
retained
for
simply
long
enough
to
let
defense
counsel
interview
them
and
then
let
the
government
deport
at
its
peril?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
an
opportunity
were
provided
and
they
didn't
take
advantage
of
it,
i
suppose
that's
too
bad.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
let's
suppose
there
are.
i
mean
what's
the
matter
with
that
then,
with
the
shorter
time
and
then
yat
point,
mr.
phillips,
that
--
that
page
30
of
the
read
brief,
they
give
some
figures
about
the
number
of
cases
and
they
say
there
were
only
11
mendez-rodriguez
motions
filed
in
a
total
oou
could
deport
at
your
peril,
i
suppose?
