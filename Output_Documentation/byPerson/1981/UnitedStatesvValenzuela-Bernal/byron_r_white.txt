justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
what
was
the
defendant
charged
with,
transporting
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
whether
he
knew
anything
about
morales,
morales
was
available
to
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
--
let's
suppose
that
defendant
knew
what
--
about
this
particular
witness.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
was
not
only
an
alien
but
that
he
hadn't
--
that
he
had
just
been
in
the
country
for
two
days.
there's
no
maps
at
the
end
of
the
case,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
the
other
witnesses
might
have
said
about
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
the
witness
who
was
there
said
he
didn't
say
anything
to
the
defendant?
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
how
long
he
had
been
there
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
on
cross-examination
of
that
witness?
or
he
testified
for
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
don't
want
him
to
see
--
if
you
would
have
asked
him
that
the
other
witnesses
or
the
other
aliens
or
whoever
they
were
--
however
you
might
want
to
call
them,
did
the
other
aliens
have
any
conversations
with
the
driver?
that
he
said
--
that
he
said
yes,
you
would
--
you
might
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
could
have
said,
“well,
what
was
the
conversation?”
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
even
take
this
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
there
might
have
been
some
help
from
the
testimony
of
these
other
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
he
would
have
said,
“no,
they
didn't
say
a
word
to
the
driver,”
you
might
--
there
isn't
much
use
those
witnesses
would
have
been
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
question
is
about
romero,
and
not
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
would
have
had
to
be
saying
something
about
romero,
not
about
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
was
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
doesn't
--
that
would
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
--
if
you
lose
this
case,
i
take
it
the
conviction
still
would
have
to
be
reviewed
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we
set
that
aside,
i
take
it
your
appeal
would
be
reinstated
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
would
still
have
to
review
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
but
you're
telling
us
it
was
the
government's
proof
that's
absolutely
deficient
on
--
on
the
knowledge
with
respect
to
the
three
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
--
can
i
ask
you?
suppose
a
day
after
arrest,
the
witnesses
are
all
available
and
the
defense
counsel
interviews
them,
he's
been
appointed
and
he
interviews
them.
and
then
the
10
days
go
by
and
at
the
hearing,
it
turns
out
that
the
government,
two
days
after
the
arrest
had
deported
all
but
--
all
but
the
witnesses
they
wanted
to
retain.
and
then,
the
defense
counsel
says,
“well,
i
want
those
witnesses
that
were
deported.”
what
would
the
judge
say
to
him
then?
wouldn't
he
make
you
show
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
government
--
if
the
government
made
the
witnesses
available
to
a
defense
counsel
even
for
a
day
and
if
he
actually
interviewed
them,
the
government
--
if
it
was
confident
enough
--
could
just
deport
them
if
he
--
if
he
--
they
were
sure
you
couldn't
make
the
showing.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
i'll
--
i'll
just
say
it
--
i'll
say,
okay,
a
reasonable
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
actually,
my
example
was
that
you
actually
had
interviewed.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
had
actually
interviewed
and
then
the
government
took
the
risk
of
deporting
them,
you
would
have
to
then
make
the
showing
that
you
--
district
showing
at
the
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
said
actually
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
you
hadn't
interviewed
but
you
had
had
a
reasonable
time
to
interview.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
hadn't
interviewed
but
you
had
had
a
reasonable
time
to
do
so
and
had
neglected
it.
