chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
powell.
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
against
valenzuela-bernal.
mr.
phillips,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
make
any
proffer
of
what
the
testimony
would
be
given
had
these
people
been
kept
in
the
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
happening
to
this
third
witness
in
the
meantime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
was
called
by
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
defendant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
my
former
question
about
whether
there
was
a
proffer.
was
there
any
suggestion
whether
a
proffered
testimony
or
otherwise
that
the
two
who
were
going
back
to
mexico,
then
deported,
would
have
justified
to
any
factors
which
were
not
available
from
the
witness
who
was
detained?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
you
meant
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
iredale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
have
taken
their
testimony
by
deposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
in
mexico.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
--
what
could
prevent
you
from
taking
that
except
the
dollars?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
terms
of
distance
from
where
you
were
operating,
how
far
were
these
witnesses
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
put
them
pretty
far
down
in
southern
mexico.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
in
the
record?
is
their
location
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
testimony
of
the
one
who
went
--
and
so
did
remain?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
he
--
did
he
justify
how
long
he
had
been
in
the
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
he
testified
to
as
to
communicating
that
information
to
this
respondent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
iredale,
suppose
the
respondents
here
had
been
driving
on
the
van
with
30
aliens
and
29
of
them
are
released
and
there
is
evidence
to
support
a
conclusion
--
a
reasonable
conclusion
by
a
jury
that
one
of
them
was
knowingly
transported.
does
it
make
any
difference
that
29
of
them
have
disappeared?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
read
you
his
testimony
when
they
asked
him
why
he
fled
at
the
checkpoint.
“why
didn't
you
stop?”
his
answer
was,
“well,
i
did
stop
but
since
i
was
bringing
in
the
people,
i
already
knew
that
i
had
--
it
was
too
late,
it
was
done.”
what
do
you
make
of
that
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
it
could
be
argued.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
could
a
reasonable
jury
conclude
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
mean?
but
they
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
--
that
you
want
to
argue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
which
again
--
let
me
come
back
to
what
do
you
--
what's
your
version
of
what
he
meant
when
he
said,
“i
already
knew
that
i
had
had
it”?
what
do
you
think
he
meant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
his
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
go
to
his
knowledge
that
this
were
at
least
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
at
least
one
illegal
alien?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then,
as
justice
white
has
asked
you,
why
isn't
that
open
for
a
review
when
the
ninth
circuit
never
reached
that
issue,
it
never
considered
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
suggested
that
there's
no
reason
why
the
government
should
keep
all
these
witnesses
in
the
country.
now,
it's
not
unusual
that
there
would
be
29
or
30
in
one
batch.
we've
seen
such
cases.
now,
i'll
go
back
to
my
hypothetical.
thirty
of
them
stashed
around
a
van,
concealed
and
--
are
you
suggesting
that
all
30
of
these
people
have
got
to
be
retained
in
the
country
to
prove
that
the
driver
knowingly
brought
them
over?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
30
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
you're
suggesting
is
it
isn't
enough
if
the
government
sustains
the
burden
of
proof
and
assumes
--
it
sustains
the
reasonable
burden
of
proof
that
one
of
them
was
there
illegally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
only
issue
is
the
--
the
--
the
knowing
aspect,
isn't
it?
so,
there's
nothing
to
witness
in
the
traditional
sense
of
seeing,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
phillips?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
that
was
page
44?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
