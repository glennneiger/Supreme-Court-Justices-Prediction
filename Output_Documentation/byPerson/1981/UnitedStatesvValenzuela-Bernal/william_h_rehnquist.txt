justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
claim,
i
take
it
here,
that
the
respondent
himself
transported
the
illegal
aliens
across
the
border
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
just
they
transported
them
after
they
were
in
the
country,
and
they
hadn't
been
here
for
a
year.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
as
leverage
for
a
plea
bargain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
a
subpoena
protect
you
from
deporting
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
might
--
consequences
might
attach
to
your
deportation
of
him,
but
i
wouldn't
think
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
iredale,
before
you
go
on
to
that
section,
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
require
the
defendant
to
make
any
sort
of
a
showing
here
before
it
dismissed
the
indictment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
defendant
show
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understand
your
statement
as
to
what
the
defendants
showed
here
were
simply
letters
to
the
missing
witnesses
saying
that
it
would
be
very
desirable
to
interview
them
on
certain
points.
was
there
nothing
more
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
relevant,
one
where
it
would
have
helped
the
government.
it
would
have
helped
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
the
defendant
himself
have
made
some
sort
of
an
affidavit
or
proffer
if
in
fact
he
hadn't
talked
to
any
of
the
deported
witnesses
in
the
car?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
after
that,
i
mean
you're
now
at
the
hearing
stages,
talked
to
his
lawyer
and
presumably
has
a
much
better
idea
from
his
lawyer
than
he
would
have
had
on
his
own.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sure,
he
has
other
kinds
of
rights
that
if
he
doesn't
testify,
he
may
not
help
himself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
presumably
if
he
swears
to
something
and
says,
“i
didn't
talk
to
these
witnesses
while
they're
in
the
car.”
the
only
need
--
the
only
theory
you
need
to
have
is
that
the
witnesses
will
actually
come
back
and
say,
“yes,
he
did
talk
to
me
a
lot
in
the
car.”
and
i
don't
see
that
that's
unduly
penalized,
i
mean,
if
he
swears
to
something
under
oath.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
reviewing
the
ninth
circuit
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
counsel
could
do
is
tell
what
the
elements
of
the
offense
are.
he
can't
say
what
the
--
the
defendant
will
know
much
more
about
counsel
as
to
the
factual
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
defendant
objects
to
an
action
of
the
magistrate
in
discharging
a
particular
witness
or
group
of
witnesses,
i
take
it
he
can
preserve
that
point
and
object
at
trial
and
conceivably
either
have
the
indictment
thrown
out
or
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
nothing
final
about
the
magistrate's
decision
either,
i
take
it,
the
defendant
there
can
pursue
the
question
into
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
if
he
wanted.
