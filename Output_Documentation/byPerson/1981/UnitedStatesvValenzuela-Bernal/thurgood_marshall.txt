justice

when
did
the
respondent
know
that
the
witnesses
were
being
set
away?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-hmm.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
suspect?
you
don't
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he'd
had
a
lawyer
you
would
know,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
attorney
on
the
31st,
so
neither
the
respondent
nor
his
lawyer
to
be
appointed
had
any
opportunity
to
oppose
the
removal
of
the
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
phillips,
on
the
proffer
point
that
was
raised
by
the
chief
justice,
what
is
this
stipulation
on
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
wasn't
agreed
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
says,
“it
is
hereby
ordered
that
the
substance
of
paragraphs
belongs
to--”
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
--
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
this
excuse
the
proffer
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
awfully
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
how
a
lawyer
who
never
talked
to
the
people
could
proffer
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
respondent;
i'm
talking
about
the
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
might
not
know
what
the
important
point
is.
that's
why
he
has
a
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
get
back
to
the
point,
why
couldn't
he
have
--
around
for
one
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
have
allowed
the
lawyer
to
talk
to
him.
it
wouldn't
have
gained
you
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
allow
the
lawyer
to
talk
to
the
witnesses.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
great
thing
was
could
--
it
would
--
i
didn't
have
to
ask
the
question.
it's
obvious
that
in
one
day,
the
lawyer
could
have
talked
to
the
witnesses.
you
can
either
admit
it
or
let
it
go.
it's
alright
with
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
on
the
day
of
the
hearing,
they
couldn't
have
talked
to
these
witnesses
if
they
were
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
had
said
--
he
had
said
any
of
those
things
to
the
respondent
in
this
case,
the
respondent
could
have
told
his
lawyer
and
his
lawyer
could
have
made
a
proffer
that
this
witness
would
say
--
that
i
talked
about
up
in
the
great
country.
and
that's
not
here.
so
what
inference
do
you
draw
from
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
not
the
defendant
testifying.
this
is
the
lawyer
testifying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
proffer
was
made
about
picking
the
grapes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
something
specific
that
you're
not
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
--
if
these
witnesses
had
said
anything
in
that
car
that
would
have
helped
him,
he
could
have
told
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
could
have
made
a
proffer.
that's
it,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
assume
that
if
a
man's
on
the
trial
for
his
liberty,
remembers,
and
if
he
doesn't
remember,
god
help
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
i
mean,
what
are
these
witnesses
going
to
testify
to?
as
of
right
now,
what
are
they
going
to
--
tell
me,
what
are
they
going
to
testify
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
your
client
tell
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
the
client
tell
his
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
can
we
do
any
business?
nobody
knows
anything
around
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
did
was
write
to
these
two
mexicans
letters
in
english.
how
do
you
know
if
they
can
read
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
spanish?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
discharged
all
your
responsibility?
