justice
potter
stewart
mr.
phillips,
before
you
--
before
you
go
on,
can
i
get
the
time
sequence
a
little
in
my
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
the
man
was
arrested
on
the
29th
of
march,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
other
occupants
of
the
vehicle
were
sent
back
on
the
30th.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
arraigned
on
the
31st,
was
it,
the
next
day?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
when
--
was
a
counsel
appointed
for
him
on
the
31st?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
would
have
been
a
question
of
whether
to
hold
him
for
one
day
to
give
the
counsel
an
opportunity
to
interview
him.
is
that
what
we're
pointing
to?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
there
a
procedure
whereby
these
things
are
processed
in
this
manner
normally
and
wouldn't
you
normally
expect
the
complaint
to
be
filled
rather
promptly?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
practice
is
to
keep
them
for
10
days?
justice
potter
stewart
after
--
i
see,
is
that
the
--
well,
i
don't
understand.
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
what
is
the
source
of
the
10-day
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
wasn't
it
followed
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
avoid
the
10-day
rule,
you
must
ship
them
back
before
the
magistrate
complaint
is
filed,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
would
the
government's
problem
be
solved
if
the
ninth
circuit
rule
were
modified
to
require
them
to
be
kept
safe
for
24
hours
or
--?
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
--
the
dispute
may
be
narrower
than
it
appears
to
be.
you
know,
that
the
other
side
seems
to
be
just
asking
for
an
opportunity
to
interview
and
the
ten
--
i
can
see
your
objection
to
the
10-day
rule
but
i
wonder
if
it
necessarily
would
apply
to
say,
a
24-hour
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
never
are
but
couldn't
he
have
asked
him
a
few
questions?
like
when
did
you
come
into
the
country
and
what
was
your
arrangement?
and
take
a
10-minute
interview,
facts
that
maybe
his
client
would
not
have
known
because
i
think
you
indicated
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
didn't
necessarily
talk
to
all
the
passengers.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
possible
the
lawyer
could
have
found
out
something
by
direct
conversation
that
he
could
not
have
found
out
through
his
client?
justice
potter
stewart
could
the
government
have
deported
him?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
under
your
view
of
this
case,
would
it
have
been
permissible
for
the
government
to
deport
him
as
well
as
all
the
other
passengers?
justice
potter
stewart
assume
you
had
a
statement
that
you
thought
was
sufficient
from
the
driver
himself
plus
the
testimony
of
the
two
agents
who
arrested
the
--
arrested
them,
that
might
have
made
out
a
sufficient
case,
just
assume.
i
think
that's
possible.
then
i
suppose
under
your
view,
you
could
also
have
deported
the
man
who
was
the
--
actually,
the
charge
was
based
on,
under
your
view
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
we
have
to
decide,
would
that
have
been
consistent
with
the
constitution?
that's
really
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
why
under
a
24-hour
rule,
you
would
be
precluded
from
deporting
them
after
they've
been
interviewed
because
the
burden
would
remain
on
the
defendant
to
make
a
showing
that
their
testimony
would
have
been
material,
i
would
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
you
seem
to
assume
that
if
there
were
a
24-hour
rule
where
you
would
just
--
somehow
there'd
be
a
counsel
appointed
immediately
then
they
interview,
you
seem
to
be
assuming
you
could
not
then
immediately
deport
if
you're
satisfied
they
have
nothing
material
to
present
because
then
i
would
suppose
if
you
did
deport,
the
lawyer
having
interviewed
the
--
the
person
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
showing
if
he
could
that
there
was
some
material
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
if
you
assume
that
the
prosecutor
should
be
the
one
who
does
the
investigating
for
defense
counsel
on
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
but
it's
a
determination
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
totally
forecloses
the
opportunity
for
the
defense
counsel
to
--
to
investigate.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
took
off,
there
was
flight
here.
the
route
was
such
that
it
tended
to
corroborate
the
government's
case.
there
are
a
lot
of
physical
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
that
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
defendant,
i
don't
really
know
what
these
other
passengers
could
have
done.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
have
belied
the
testimony
of
the
one
man
who
was
admittedly
just
had
entered
the
day
before.
justice
potter
stewart
that
he's
been
hiding
in
this
place
for
four
years,
is
that
the
idea?
i
mean
if
the
whole
circumstances
certainly
are
not
consistent
with
over
three
years
before
they
suddenly
chased
him
via
the
checkpoint.
justice
potter
stewart
on
that
point,
mr.
phillips,
that
--
that
page
30
of
the
read
brief,
they
give
some
figures
about
the
number
of
cases
and
they
say
there
were
only
11
mendez-rodriguez
motions
filed
in
a
total
of
239
cases
and
only
one
motion
was
granted.
is
that
--
is
that
accurate?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
assuming
this
case
is
an
atypical
case
then.
the
government
deviated
from
its
normal
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
the
5000
that
have
been
detained,
for
how
long?
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
any
notion
of
what
the
average
period
is?
