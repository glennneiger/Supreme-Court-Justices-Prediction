mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
at
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
three
questions
presented.
first,
the
united
states
violates
a
criminal
defendant's
fifth
amendment
due
process
or
sixth
amendment
compulsory
process
rights
when
it
deports
an
illegal
alien
after
making
a
reasonable
investigation
in
concluding
that
the
illegal
alien
has
no
material
exculpatory
evidence
to
make
available
to
the
defendant.
second,
assuming
that
the
government
acts
at
its
peril
in
deporting
illegal
aliens
while
the
defendant
in
order
to
state
a
constitutional
violation
still
must
demonstrate
that
the
laws
of
the
illegal
alien
has
caused
him
a
concrete
loss
of
material
exculpatory
evidence.
finally,
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
that
the
--
that
the
respondent's
constitutional
rights
are
violated
when
the
defendant
is
deprived
of
no
more
than
the
loss
of
a
conceivable
benefit
or
the
proper
remedy
for
that
technical
constitutional
violation
is
dismissal
of
the
indictment
against
the
respondent.
on
march
29th,
1980,
respondent
was
captured
in
the
process
of
transporting
five
illegal
aliens
from
escondido,
california
to
los
angeles.
the
circumstances
surrounding
respondent's
arrest
were
explained
by
respondent
in
his
own
post
arrest
statement
volunteered
to
border
patrol
agents.
respondent
is
an
illegal
alien
from
mexico,
he
entered
the
--
he
entered
this
country
approximately
six
days
prior
to
his
arrest
with
the
assistance
of
an
illegal
alien
smuggler.
he
had
been
kept
in
a
house
in
escondido
prior
up
to
the
day
of
his
arrest.
on
the
day
he
was
arrested,
he
agreed
with
the
illegal
alien
smuggler
to
transport
five
additional
illegal
aliens
to
los
angeles
in
return
for
the
price
of
his
illegal
entry
into
this
country.
respondent
had
been
told
that
the
border
patrol
agents
at
the
temecula
checkpoint
were
not
actually
checking
for
illegal
aliens;
unfortunately,
for
respondent,
he
was
misinformed
and
was
pulled
over
to
the
side
or
at
least
was
motioned
over
to
the
side.
he
slowed
the
car
down
and
then
drove
away
at
a
very
high
rate
of
speed.
border
patrol
agents
chased
him,
two
agents
in
a
single
car
and
respondent
stopped
his
car
approximately
a
mile
away
from
the
checkpoint
and
fled
on
foot
along
with
the
other
five
illegal
aliens.
respondent
and
three
illegal
aliens
were
captured
by
the
border
patrol
agents;
two
other
illegal
aliens,
however,
escaped.
the
border
patrol
agents
then
returned
the
respondent
back
to
the
border
patrol
checkpoint,
informed
the
respondent
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
he,
however,
waives
the
right
and
agreed
to
make
a
statement
under
oath.
in
the
recorded
statement,
he
explained
his
decision
to
flee
from
the
border
patrol
checkpoint
on
the
basis,
“i
already
knew
that
i
had
had
it,
too
late.
it
was
done.”
later,
he
told
the
agents,
“i
acknowledge
the
charge
of
driving.”
the
agents
also
interviewed
the
other
illegal
aliens
and
they
all
admitted
that
they
were
in
the
county
illegally
and
the
respondent
had
been
the
driver
of
the
car.
the
border
patrol
agent
at
that
point
or
soon
thereafter
called
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
the
southern
district
of
california
for
advice
as
to
how
to
proceed
in
the
case.
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
based
on
the
information
regarding
the
respondent's
apparent
confession,
the
accumulative
nature
of
--
of
the
statements
made
by
the
three
additional
illegal
aliens
and
the
general
circumstances
surrounding
the
arrest,
the
flight,
et
cetera,
decided
that
no
useful
purpose
would
be
served
either
for
the
government
or
for
the
defendant
in
requiring
two
otherwise
none
--
not
prosecutable
by
our
--
in
our
discretion,
however,
but
not
prosecutable
illegal
aliens
to
remain
in
custody
and
therefore
authorized
the
release
of
those
two
illegal
aliens
back
in
mexico.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
sir.
there
were.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
unfortunately,
the
tape
recorder
had
malfunctioned.
originally,
it
was
thought
that
the
tape
recording
of
respondent's
statement
had
malfunctioned
and
there
was
no
statement
from
him
but
it
turned
out
that
the
malfunction
was
--
occurred
during
the
time
that
the
statements
of
the
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
not
a
specific
written
or
recorded
statement;
although
i
think
typically
there
would
be,
moreover,
we
do
of
course
have
the
statement
from
the
remaining
illegal
alien,
romero-morales,
and
the
statements
from
the
border
patrol
agents,
and
all
the
statements
by
all
of
the
agents
--
or
excuse
me,
by
all
of
the
illegal
aliens
are
essentially
the
same.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
subsequently
when
he
testified
at
the
--
at
the
hearing,
they
received
--
they
obtained
that
statement
and
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
his
statement
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
different
from
the
statement
given
to
the
border
patrol
agents
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
authorized
the
release
of
two
of
the
three
illegal
aliens
chosen
at
random
and
they
were
released
on
march
30th
of
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
ma'am.we
could
have
prosecuted
them
for
illegal
entry
into
this
country.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
significantly
easier,
your
honor,
our
resources
to
do
that.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
two
illegal
aliens
were
returned
on
march
30
concededly
prior
to
the
time
the
respondent's
counsel
had
any
opportunity
to
interview
them.the
respondent
was
indicted
on
one
count
of
transporting
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
the
respondent
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
believe
it
was
appointed
counsel.
respondent
was
indicted
on
one
count
of
transporting
an
illegal
alien,
romero-morales,
within
this
country
in
violation
of
8
u.s.c.
1324(a)(2).
soon
thereafter,
he
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
deportation
of
the
two
illegal
aliens
had
the
prior
--
had
violated
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
district
court
held
a
hearing
on
the
motion
at
that
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
specifically,
the
closest
thing
to
a
proffer,
i
suppose,
would
be
--
he
did
offer
a
testimony
of
romero-morales
at
the
hearing.
romero-morales
was
at
least
putatively
a
defense
witness
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss;
although
i
submit
that
his
statements
were
rather
strongly
inculpatory
of
respondent
rather
than
exculpatory.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
think
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
assume
that
that
was
the
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
this
specific
case
it
would
have
been
but
there
was
no
way,
i
don't
think,
of
knowing
that
at
the
time
necessarily.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
would
assume
that;
although,
of
course,
it's
--
it's
not
really
accurate
--
altogether
accurate
to
say
that
it's
only
holding
him
for
a
single
day.
i
mean
other
than
the
fact
that
he
would
have
had
counsel
appointed
at
that
point,
there
still
presumably
would
have
been
a
period
of
time
the
counsel
would
have
required
in
order
to
investigate
the
matter
and
to
pursue
it.
typically,
the
practice
is
to
keep
the
illegal
aliens
for
10
days
even
after
a
counsel
is
appointed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
just
a
--
it's
a
common
law
practice.
i
think
it's
developed
primarily
by
the
magistrates
in
the
southern
district
of
california;
although
it
is
also
adopted
in
other
districts.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
the
case
wasn't
submitted
to
--
it
wasn't
--
the
illegal
aliens
were
already
gone
prior
to
the
time
that
it
went
to
the
magistrate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
a
sense,
yes,
your
honor
because
the
problem
is
that
given
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
magistrate's
simply
not
in
a
position
to
release
the
illegal
aliens
unless
we
--
unless
we
can
modify
the
ninth
circuit's
very
strict
ruling,
it's
very
difficult
to
have
a
magistrate
agree
to
release
the
illegal
aliens
even
though
there
is
no
likelihood
of
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
suspect
that
--
i
mean,
obviously,
the
government's
position
would
be
immaterially
advanced
by
a
24-hour
rule
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
decision
as
to
how
much
time
is
one
--
that
is
a
--
you
know,
it's
not
an
easy
judgment
to
make
and
certainly,
i
wouldn't
--
it's
a
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--
close
legislative
judgment.
i
don't
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
might
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
significantly
more
difficult.
i
mean
it
would
certainly
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
without
consulting
a
counsel,
you
mean?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
it's
still
--
our
submission
is
that
there
was
no
prejudice
whatsoever
and
the
--
and
--
and
even
if
there
were
some
claim
that
we
violated
his
right
to
counsel,
you
would
still
have
to
have
a
demonstration
of
prejudice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
don't
have
there
--
i
mean
i
--
no,
i
don't
think
--
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
at
the
test
--
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
testimony
was
offered
by
the
two
arresting
border
patrol
agents,
the
detained
illegal
alien,
romero-morales,
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
approved
the
release
of
the
two
illegal
aliens.
based
largely
on
the
post
arrest
admissions
by
the
respondent,
the
district
court
held
that
the
loss
of
the
missing
illegal
aliens
could
not
possibly
or
at
least
with
no
substantial
possibility
have
prejudiced
defendant's
--
respondent's
case
and
therefore,
he
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
when
did
he
learn
that
the
witnesses
had
been
sent
away?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
suspect
probably
on
the
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
exactly
when
they
--
when
he
was
informed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
assume
his
attorney
was
probably
informed
on
the
31st.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
is
being
detained
--
he
was
--
he
was
detained
in
custody
as
a
material
witness
for
the
government
or
--
and
also
for
the
defendant
as
it
turns
out
--
i
mean,
for
the
respondent
as
it
turns
out
he
--
he
did
testify
on
behalf
of
the
respondent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
was
called
by
the
respondent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
his
statement
was
that
he
wasn't
an
illegal
alien,
that
he
had
been
in
this
country
for
less
than
two
days
at
the
time
that
the
respondent
transported
him,
that
the
respondent
was
the
--
was
the
driver
of
the
car.
so
then
--
while
he
was
nominally
a
witness
on
behalf
of
the
respondent,
in
reality
i
submit
that
his
testimony
was
rather
inculpatory.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
circumstance
--
i
mean,
the
respondent
had
ample
opportunity
to
chat
with
those
witnesses,
your
honor.
he
was
at
the
house
at
the
time
prior
to
the
transportation,
he
was
in
the
car
the
whole
time
during
the
transportation,
and
he
was
there
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but
his
lawyer
certainly
had
access
to
the
respondent
and
to
any
information
that
the
respondent
has.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
even
if
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
even
if
respondent
couldn't
make
an
immediate
judgment
as
to
how
to
proceed
in
this
matter,
certainly
sometime
between
the
period
or
the
time
when
he
was
arrested
and
the
post
arrest
period
all
the
way
up
until
the
time
of
the
trial
respondent
had
ample
opportunity
to
explain
to
his
attorney
what
possible
defenses
might
be
available
and
even
to
this
day
we
still
have
nothing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
concededly
it
is
somewhat
different;
although
it
is
not
--
i
mean,
this
court
has
never
had
any
trouble
in
the
roviaro
context
in
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
not
that
we're
really
--
i
mean
actually
not,
i
mean
if
we
were
to
take
--
if
we
were
to
reason
by
analogy
from
united
states
versus
lovasco,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
that
the
united
states
simply
in
pursuing
its
policy
with
regard
to
immigration,
should
simply
deport
the
illegal
aliens.
all
we
do
in
this
context
is
attempt
to
provide
a
certain
amount
of
protection
for
the
respondent
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
provide
him
with
certain
amount
of
protection.i
don't
think
that
should
give
raise
to
any
inherent
problems.
i
mean,
otherwise,
we
would
just
simply
deport
him
as
the
court
held
in
united
states
versus
rose
on
the
first
circuit
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
our
assumption
would
be
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
was
reason
to
suspect
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
true.
concededly
we
have
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
exactly
what
the
court's
sanctioned
in
united
states
versus
rose
but
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
adapt
that
view
although
as
i
said
it
would
certainly
--
it
would
certainly
further
our
immigration
policies
if
the
court
order
were
to
adapt
that
view,
but
we're
prepared
to
give
the
respondent
perhaps
more
protection
than
he
otherwise
might
require.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
admittedly
we
do
but
we
also
in
the
process
of
interviewing
a
witness
on
our
--
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
is
any
inculpatory
evidence
we
necessarily
discover
whether
there's
any
exculpatory
evidence.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
certainly
the
cost
is
a
significant
factor
but
i
think
the
idea
of
--
of
having
illegal
aliens
languishing
in
jail
for
a
period
of
time
when
no
one
has
any
intention
of
calling
them
as
witnesses
either
the
government
or
the
defendant
and
no
one
has
--
you
know,
and
they're
not
going
to
serve
any
useful
function
to
anybody,
i
think
that's
the
primary
interest
to
the
federal
government
in
these
cases.
and
to
go
back
to
the
statistics
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
it
--
there's
something
wrong
with
the
rule
of
law
that
requires
the
federal
government
to
detain
5,000
illegal
aliens
as
material
witnesses
in
a
district
in
which
there
are
36
trials
on
title
8
offenses.
there's
something
just
fundamentally
wrong
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
our
submission
is
that
none
of
those
--
that
none
of
those
alternatives
is
very
useful.
specifically,
they
suggest
the
use
of
work
farms.
the
united
states
--
the
southern
district
of
california
at
least
does
not
have
a
work
farm.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
difficulty
with
that,
with
the
idea
of
an
early
interview
is
one,
it's
difficult
just
to
get
--
get
counsel
appointed.
i
mean
a
lot
of
this
--
a
lot
of
captures
are
not
in
locations
where
counsel
is
close
by
so
there's
certainly
a
period
of
time
lost
in
that
process.
second
of
all,
it's
not
altogether
clear
what
an
early
interview
will
accomplish.
testimony
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
at
the
--
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
to
the
effect
that
oftentimes
defense
counsel
prefers
to
be
able
to
try
to
retain
illegal
alien
material
witnesses
even
without
any
expectation
of
having
them
testify
simply
as
leverage
against
the
government
for
a
plea
bargain
arrangement
so
that
i'm
not
sure
that
we're
going
to
be
at
anything
by
virtue
of
having
--
having
counsel
there
earlier.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
--
i
mean
if
--
it
is
absolutely
true
that
the
government
can
only
hold
so
many
material
witnesses.
as
it
stands
now
we
are
running
out
of
space
in
the
state
jails.
and
when
we
get
to
the
point
when
we
can
hold
no
more
illegal
aliens
we
simply
either
have
to
release
the
defendants
or
release
the
illegal
aliens
and
thereby
end
up
losing
our
ability
to
prosecute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
was
a
stipulation
offered
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
your
honor,
that
we
were
willing
to
--
we
were
willing
to
stipulate
that
the
illegal
aliens
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor.
at
least
if
it
was
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
anybody
responded
to
it.
but
it
was
our
stipulation
that
we
were
willing
to
say
that
none
of
the
illegal
aliens
had
told
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i'm
sorry.
as
i
said,
the
stipulation
with
regard
to
the
oral
--
with
regard
to
the
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
was
produced
at
the
oral
hearing.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
at
the
hearing
to
the
--
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
that
stipulation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
was
agreed
to,
yes,
that's
why
there
wasn't
a
trial
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor.
all
that
does
is
explain
why
there
wasn't
a
specific
trial
in
the
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
was
just
--
referring
to
the
offer
to
stipulate
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
the
illegal
aliens
who
had
been
deported
would
not
testify
--
would
not
have
testified
that
they
had
told
the
respondent
that
they
were
illegal
aliens
and
have
been
in
this
country
for
more
than
three
years.
basically,
we're
willing
to
agree
that
to
the
romero-morales'
testimony
which
was
that
they
never
said
anything
at
all
in
that
automobile.
and
so
in
order
to
prove
respondent's
knowledge
we
were
going
to
have
to
use
the
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
nothing
at
all
was
said
at
all
on
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
your
honor,
he
has
--
he
still
has
access
to
the
respondent.
i'm
not
--
you
know
--
this
is
not
a
case
of
mistaken
identity.
this
individual
was
there
at
all
relevant
times.
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“you
can
typically
tell
in
these
cases
what
exactly
happened.”
and
so
the
respondent
was
in
the
presence
of
the
missing
witnesses
at
all
times.
he
presumably
can
suggest
something.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
lawyer
has
access
to
the
respondent.
i
mean,
there's
no
reason
to
assume
the
respondent
would
lie
to
him.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
certainly,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
his
attorney
can
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
one
day
wouldn't
have
gained
us
anything,
your
honor.
one
day
would
not
have
gained
us
anything
in
most
instances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
and
it
wouldn't
have
gained
anybody
anything
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so,
i
mean,
--
well,
it
wouldn't
have
allowed
the
lawyer
to
make
any
kind
of
a
reasonable
conversation
with
the
witnesses
because
they
had
no
opportunity
to
investigate
the
matter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
he
could
have
talked
to
them
but
i'm
not
sure
that
anything
meaningful
would
have
come
from
that
conversation,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
there's
no
question
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean
as
to
their
illegal
alien
status?
i
mean,
the
only
person
whose
illegal
alien
status
is
relevant
to
this
prosecution,
however,
is
romero-morales.
and
romero-morales
is
available
to
talk
with
the
attorney.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean
aside
from
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
problems?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
would
have
been
--
the
problem
that
that
would
have
created
is
we
would
have
a
no
--
we
would
have
lacked
a
non-hearsay
basis
for
proving
some
of
the
elements
and
perhaps
created
a
confrontation
clause
problem.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
i
suspect
that
we
might
well
have
been
able
to
do
that
although
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
but
there
was
still
--
and
you
have
to
analyze
it
in
two
different
grounds.
one,
on
the
basis
of
the
reasonableness
of
our
decision
to
release
him,
which
is
probably
questionable
on
those
circumstances
since
there's
no
--
since
the
detention
of
one
illegal
alien
versus
three
is
--
is
perhaps
not
all
that
onerous
a
burden
on
us.
second
of
all,
you
still
would
have
to
show
that
he
was
a
material
witness
in
any
sense.
i
mean
typically,
this
is
--
in
some
ways,
it's
unfortunate
to
this
case
--
in
this
case
that
the
--
that
the
tape
recorder
broke
because,
typically,
we
would
have
an
oral
statement
on
--
from
everyone
that
we
could
then
examine.
and
that
would
presumably
serve
as
at
least
some
basis
for
the
counsel
to
inquire
as
to
what
possible
grounds
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
you
were
prepared
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
if
we
had
that
statement
in
hand,
we
can
go
ahead
and
deport
the
illegal
aliens.
that
may
well
be
true.
but
what
we're
looking
for
--
i
mean
this
specific
--
this
specific
case
is
not
what's
terribly
important.
this
is
not
a
case
about
two
illegal
aliens
and
one
criminal
defendant.
this
is
a
case
literally
about
thousands
of
illegal
aliens.
the
united
states
captures
--
has
captured
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
one
million
illegal
aliens.
each
of
those,
not
every
one
of
those
illegal
aliens,
of
course
necessarily
raises
the
mendez-rodriguez
problem.
now
if
you
consider
that
most
of
them
probably
had
some
assistance
coming
into
this
country,
probably
had
some
assistance
in
trying
to
conceal
themselves
from
the
authorities
and
probably,
because
of
where
they
ended
up
having
to
stay
within
this
country
came
across
criminal
activity
of
another
nature,
the
chances
of
a
mendez-rodriguez
problem
with
regard
to
all
one
million
of
those
illegal
aliens
is
fairly
good.
and
it
cannot
be
that
the
government
is
responsible
to
keep
all
of
those
illegal
aliens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
not
altogether
clear,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
question
is,
does
that
mean
after
they
interview
them
and
regardless
of
what
they
say,
we
then
have
the
right
to
go
ahead
and
deport
them?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
or
what
if
they
interpose
an
objection
is
the
problem.
they
then
interpose
an
objection,
we
go
to
a
magistrate,
the
magistrate
under
the
ninth
circuit's
regiment
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
he
asked
--
if
he
--
well,
no,
obviously,
if
he
had
a
subpoena
in
hand,
we
might
try
to
fight
the
subpoena.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
if
--
i
guess
a
subpoena
doesn't
actually
act
against
the
government.
it
acts
--
it
acts
against
the
illegal
alien.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that's
true.
it
wouldn't
directly
prohibit
us
from
--
from
deporting
--
that's
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
suspect
we
would
not.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
missed
that
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but
i
guess
--
i
guess
our
response
to
that
is
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
significant
difference
between
what
we've
done
here
because
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
appointment
of
a
counsel
in
this
situation
would
have
materially
altered
the
ultimate
findings
of
the
district
court
that
should
have
been
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
only
--
but
it's
only
that
the
--
that
the
government
makes
the
initial
determination.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
then
subsequently,
that's
subject
to
review.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
--
i
mean
i
guess
our
response
to
that
is
that
there
--
it's
just
not
simply
realistic
to
say
that
they
cannot
know.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
roviaro,
where
you're
denied
access
to
the
confidential
informant
unless
you
can
make
a
showing
that
he
has
some
materiality.
you
don't
--
you've
never
talked
to
him.
the
assumption
is
because
you
were
present
at
the
crime
that
you
can
take
action.
and
therefore
--
and
this
court
has
consistently
upheld
the
right
of
the
government
to
deny
you
access
to
the
confidential
informant
in
those
circumstances.
we
submit
that
the
government's
interest
in
this
case
is
every
bit
as
great
as
in
that
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
of
course
they
could
have
talked
to
them
if
they
had
been
there,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
just
a
few
remarks,
mr.
chief
justice.
initially,
i've
point
out
from
the
record
that
romero-morales
was
asked
whether
he
had
heard
any
testimony
or
any
statements
made
to
the
driver
by
any
of
the
illegal
aliens
who
had
been
deported.
that's
on
page
44,
the
joint
appendix
as
to
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
both
in
terms
of
the
car
and
then
at
the
house
prior
to
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
did
--
he
just
said
he
didn't
hear
any
statements
made,
but
he
was
in
their
presence
and
if
you're
inside
a
car
and
they
were
together
in
the
same
room
of
the
house
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
at
the
bottom.
with
regard
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
practice
in
the
southern
district
to
california,
it
sounds
good
when
you
talk
about
individualized
cases
and
the
step-by-step
determination.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
aggregate
effect
of
the
rule
in
the
southern
district
of
california
is
best
demonstrated
by
the
statistics.
five
thousand
illegal
aliens
held
in
custody
in
order
for
36
trials,
and
we
don't
even
know
of
those
36
trials,
how
many
if
any
illegal
aliens
ever
testified
on
behalf
of
a
defendant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
--
we
did
not
independently
evaluate
that;
although,
we
wouldn't
be
terribly
surprised
if
there
aren't
a
lot
of
mendez-rodriguez
cases
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
government's
practice
is
typically
to
detain
all
illegal
aliens
and/or
to
dismiss
the
charges.
so
you
wouldn't
expect
there'd
be
very
many
cases.
it
doesn't
come
up
because
we
assume
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
this
case,
the
government
tested
the
theory
of
how
much
prejudice
has
to
be
demonstrated.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
with
regard
to
a
couple
of
points
made
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
varies
from
one
day
to
120
days,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
average
according
to
the
marshall
is
something
in
excess
of
five
days
per
person.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
don't
know
where
--
i
don't
understand
how
the
respondent
can
make
that
claim.
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
in
light
of
cases
like
(inaudible)
where
the
government
has
to
detain
39
material
witnesses
for
an
excess
of
two
weeks
because
of
a
decision
and
expressly
on
those
facts
by
the
ninth
circuit.
how
could
it
be
that
if
the
government
altered
its
position,
a
number
of
illegal
aliens
wouldn't
be
reduced?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
that
sounds
good
in
theory,
your
honor,
but
the
reality
is
that
we
simply
can't
get
defense
counsel
there
and
ready
to
go
contrary
to
what
respondents
suggest.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
may,
well
--
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
probably
true
although
we
don't
--
i
mean,
you
have
to
set
specific
deadlines
and
the
ninth
circuit
at
this
point
has
been
disinclined
to
say
anything
less
than
10
days.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
--
if
we
thought
it
would
work
and
then
we
could
in
fact
deport
at
our
peril
and
given
them
two
days,
i
just
think
we're
going
to
have
trouble
if
that
--
having
that
enforced
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
ultimately
that's
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
we
then
have
to
make
that
kind
of
a
determination
with
regard
to
each
of
the
one
million
illegal
aliens
who
are
captured.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
ninth
circuit
holds
that
if
we
make
a
determination,
that
there
is
no
connection
in
--
in
time
or
space
between
the
illegal
alien
and
a
criminal
defendant,
then
we
can
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
what
we're
suggesting
though
is
that
there
is
not
a
demonstrable
difference
--
yes,
that
is
our
submission
but
that's
not
demonstrably
different
from
the
judgment
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
is
that
--
is
that
respondent
under
any
circumstances
must
demonstrate
with
some
concreteness
the
materiality
of
the
witnesses
that
were
lost
which
they
cannot
do
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
fifth
circuit
adapts
a
rule
very
much
like
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
in
the
avila-dominguez
case,
those
--
those
witnesses
were
witnesses
to
the
crime
at
the
time
they
were
arrested
and
the
court
held
that
they
could
be
--
that
they
could
be
sent
away.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
certainly,
to
the
extent
there
is
a
review,
but
--
i
mean
we
don't
--
we
don't,
you
know
wither
from
the
notion
that
there'll
be
judicial
review
of
our
determination.
i
think
we'll
be
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
we
regularly
take
that
risk,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
once
we
make
an
evaluation
and
if
we
think
there
is
no
material
exculpatory
evidence,
we
will
deport.
the
--
we
won't
keep
more
than
several.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
it's
not
my
decision
to
take
that
risk
but
the
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
true,
the
border
patrol
agents
and
the
fifth
circuit
have
on
occasion
released
illegal
aliens
especially
in
circumstances
such
like
the
(inaudible)
position
--
situation
where
you
have
a
large
number
of
illegal
aliens
all
of
whom
seem
to
say
the
same
thing.
we
don't
detain
all
39
of
them
in
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
then,
there
would
certainly
be
some
instances
where
there
is
clear
inculpatory
statements
made
by
the
--
by
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
where
all
other
statements
that
are
sworn
by
the
illegal
aliens
are
cumulative,
we
will
almost
assuredly
release
some
illegal
aliens.
