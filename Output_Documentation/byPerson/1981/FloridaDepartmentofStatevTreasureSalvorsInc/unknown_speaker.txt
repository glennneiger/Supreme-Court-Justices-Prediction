unknown
speaker
why
was
florida
not
a
party
to
it?
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
conscious
decision
not
to
intervene
on
the
part
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
it
was
convenient
to
get
the
united
states
in.
unknown
speaker
did
the
united
states
intervene
at
the
behest
of
the
state
of
florida?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
give
me
an
assurance
as
to
that
answer,
however.
unknown
speaker
and
how
did
they
come
into
the
possession
of
the
states,
mrs.
smathers?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
only
that
portion
which
to
that
time
had
been
recovered?
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
got
25
percent
and
respondents
kept
75
percent
of
it?
unknown
speaker
you
say
in
the
original
libel
the
artifacts
which
had
been
distributed
to
florida
or
were
to
be
distributed
to
the
state
of
florida
were
not...
their
title
was
not
challenged?
unknown
speaker
could
i
follow
through
on
your
answer
to
justice
brennan?
unknown
speaker
he
asked
whether
the
respondents
kept
75
percent.
wasn't
there
a
time
when
the
state
of
florida
had
possession
of
all
of
them?
unknown
speaker
is
there
not
an
implication
in
the
papers,
however,
that
florida's
release
of
75
percent
of
them
was
with
some
reluctance?
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
more
question,
and
it
may
be
irrelevant
to
your
basic
legal
argument,
but
there
is
an
inference
also
in
the
papers
that
the
contract
was
made
under
threat
of
arrest.
is
this
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
it's
a
valid
contract
then.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
at
this
point?
with
respect
to
those
artifacts
that
are
in
florida's
possession
is
it
florida's
position
that
those
belong
entirely
to
the
state
or
they're
to
be
shared
75/25?
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
telling
me.
you're
saying
that
those
which
they
have
in
their
possession
represent
25
percent
of
the
total,
is
that
it,
and
therefore--
unknown
speaker
--of
those
which
were
originally
delivered
to
florida,
florida
has
only
retained
25
percent
of
those.
unknown
speaker
has
florida
instituted
any
litigation
in
state
courts
to
resolve
any
of
these
issues?
unknown
speaker
but
nothing
has
been
filed.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
relative
proportion
of
what's
been
recovered
and
is
in
florida's
possession
as
opposed
to
what
remains...
i
guess
some
is
still
in
the
ocean,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
has
been
recovered?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
still
in
the
ocean?
unknown
speaker
what
is
in
dispute.
well,
what
is
the
value
of
what
remains?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
major
portion
of
what
may
have
been
on
the
spanish
ship
is
not
in
dispute
here.
unknown
speaker
and
florida
has
made
no
claim
to
that
either
in
the
state
court
or
elsewhere.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
contract,
i
gather,
covers
that,
too,
doesn't
it?
the
contract
florida
made
with
respondents
covers,
does
it,
what's
still
in
the
ocean?
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
me
then
that
what's
still
in
the
ocean
is
not
subject
to
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
argument
you
make
in
the
last
part
of
your
brief
is
valid,
florida
would
have
a
claim
to
all
that,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
apparently
notwithstanding
the
immense
amount
of
value
there,
it's
not
a
claim
that
has
enough
merit
to
have
persuaded
you
even
to
institute
a
lawsuit
to
assert
it.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
a
little
worried
about
whether
you
do
have...
that
that
is
in
your
waters?
unknown
speaker
is
that
why
you
didn't
file
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
supposing
your
maritime
people
who
were
going
to
make
the
arrests
before
this
whole
thing
got
started
went
out
and
used
self
help
to
go
start
taking
some
of
these
things
off
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
themselves,
and
your
adversaries
then
sought
an
injunction
to
force
them
to
stop.
would
you
have
an
eleventh
amendment
defense
to
that
injunction
action?
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
united
states
v.
lee?
unknown
speaker
if
the
defendants
in
that
case
had
been
state
officials
and
the
issue
was
the
title
to
state
property
would
the
case
have
come
out
differently?
unknown
speaker
possible.
so
why
isn't
u.s.
v.
lee
relevant
here?
unknown
speaker
is
it
because
it's
just
a
sovereign
immunity
case,
or
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
take
the
way
out
that
this
was
just
against
state
officials.
unknown
speaker
they
said
even
if
it's
against
the
state,
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
bar
it
because
at
the
outset
you
have
a
jurisdictional
question,
namely
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
really
bear
on
the
eleventh
amendment
issue?
unknown
speaker
i
realize
that.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
eleventh
amendment
is
strictly
a
defense
between
a
state
and
an
individual;
but
i
take
it
florida
has
sought
to
assert
it
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
it
can't.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
rested
on?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
find
that
language
on
page
7.
am
i
looking
at
the
wrong
7?
unknown
speaker
the
language
you
just
read.
unknown
speaker
the
trial
court's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
this--
unknown
speaker
--what
page,
please?
the
index
doesn't
help
me
very
much.
well,
don't
stop
your
argument
now
then.
i'll
get
at
it
later.
unknown
speaker
this
is
an
admiralty
case,
not
an
equity
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
i
take
it
that
you
seem
to
agree
that
the
fifth
circuit
decided
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
state
was
involved,
just
not
two
officials,
and
said
even
if
the
state
is
involved,
a
court
may
look
beyond
a
mere
assertion.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
that
this
just
involved
state
officials
rather
than
the
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
that
the
first
time
the
state
became
a
party
in
its
own
name
was
pursuant
to
a
paper
that
the
state
had
filed?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
state
file
in
that
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
on
the
ground
that?
unknown
speaker
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
not
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
be
sure
i
have
the
right...
is
the
document
you
refer
to
the
one
that's
entitled,
"state
of
florida's
motion
to
quash
warrant
for
arrest
in
rem?
"
unknown
speaker
that's
on
page
43
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
didn't
read
queen
city
as
holding
that.
unknown
speaker
you
draw
from
that
a
negative
implication
that
if
there
were
a
special
challenge,
the
court
would
have
not
followed
the
doctrine
of
queen
city?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
queen
city
it
was
more
an
application
of
principles
traditionally
applicable
to
municipal
corporations,
and
saying
that
even
if
you're
a
municipal
corporation
not
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
you
are
still
not
subject
to
this
sort
of
a
libel
and
admiralty;
and
then
saying
if
it's
true
of
municipal
corporations
it's
true
of
a
fortiori
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
a
colorable
claim
to
ownership
would
suffice
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
just
a
colorable
claim?
unknown
speaker
but
answer
in
the
abstract,
if
you
would,
without
reference
to
these
disturbing
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
then
that
for
jurisdictional
purposes
the
entire
dispute
over
ownership
can
be
settled
by
the
court
before
you
even
determine
whether
the
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
be
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
anyway.
unknown
speaker
before
you
can
reach
the
claim
of
ownership
don't
you
have
to...
a
question
of
ownership,
as
you
put
it,
a
jurisdictional
matter,
don't
you
have
to
surmount
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
rested
its
judgment
on
that
ground,
it
might
be
one
thing,
but
that
isn't
the
ground
it
rested
on.
unknown
speaker
the
ground
it
rested
on
was
that
this
is
an
argument
between
the
state
and
the
individual,
but
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
bar
it
because
the
state
doesn't
own
the
property.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
ground
it
used?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
read
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
said
that
the
property
was
in
the
possession
of
a
certain
named
department
of
the
state
government.
that's
what
he
found.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
the
court
said
it's
in
possession
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
here
you
have
the
state
of
florida
as
concededly
a
party,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
you
don't
get
to
the
ex
parte
young
situation
unless
you
dismiss
the
state
of
florida
and
say
that
your
action
should
go
on
just
as
between
you
and
the
two
state
officials.
that's
alabama
against
pugh.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
don't
think
that
does
some
damage
to
the
eleventh
amendment
aspect?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
at
issue
here
are
the
things
that
were
delivered
to
florida.
unknown
speaker
up
to
a
certain
point,
up
to
a
certain
point.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
that
material.
you
mean
the
florida
courts
wouldn't
entertain
an
action
on
a
salvage
contract?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
equities,
whatever
they
may
be
in
this
case,
are
irrelevant
to
the
issue
that's
now
before
us?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
what
the
first
response
of
florida
was
to
the
service
of
this
writ?
unknown
speaker
but
when
they
issued
the
order
to
show
cause
was
the
state's
response
to
that
in
part
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
submit
the
question
of
your
contract?
in
response
to
that
motion
to
show
cause
you
showed
up
and
submitted
on
the
merits,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
chronology
was.
unknown
speaker
your
first
response
to
the
order
to
show
cause
as
to
why
the
state
shouldn't
turn
over
the
property
did
not
contain
the
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
a
jurisdictional
matter.
unknown
speaker
but
let
me
ask
you.
supposing
you'd
thought
about
the
eleventh
amendment
when
your
two
officials
received
the
process.
you
then
decided
to
assert
the
eleventh
amendment
as
a
defense.
could
you
have
done
so
without
alleging
that
the
state
owned
the
property.
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
merely
said
these
are
state
officials;
they
work
for
the
state
of
florida;
therefore,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
bar
to
enforcement
of
this
process.
would
that
have
been
enough?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
your
position
here,
that
that's
all
you
had
to
do
in
order
to
win,
or
did
you
not
in
addition
have
to
say
that
they're
in
custody
of
property
that
belongs
to
the
state
of
florida?
did
you
not
have
to
raise
the
merits
even
to
raise
the
jurisdictional
issue?
unknown
speaker
i
know
what
you
had.
i'm
just
asking
in
your
view
what
did
you
have
to
do
to
prevent
the
federal
court...
say
you
did
it
as
fast
as
you
possibly
could...
from
asserting
jurisdiction
over
these
two
individuals?
what
kind
of
a
pleading
would
you
have
had
to
file?
unknown
speaker
and
supposing
in
reply
to
that
pleading
there
had
been
some
response
filed
that
had
showed
that
there
had
been
res
judicata
on
the
issue
and
you
had
no
valid
claim
of
ownership,
could
you
then
still
have
asserted
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
without
any
basis
for
really
supporting
the
ownership
claim.
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
you
assert
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
just
to
a
possessory
action,
a
possessory
action
against
the
state
to
make
the
state
turn
over
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
say
you
have
to
claim
ownership
in
order
to
assert
the
eleventh
amendment?
all
you
have
to
claim
is
possession,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
state
was
in
possession
of
the
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
state
has
to
go
farther
and
say
that
it
does
have
a
colorable
claim
to
title
as
well
as
possession?
do
you
think
the
possessory
action
against
the
state
is
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but,
mrs.
smathers,
if
that's
your
position,
supposing
you
had
an
ordinary
case
of
a
police
officer
searching
an
individual's
car,
taking
possession
of
property,
turning
it
over
to
the
policy
property
custodian...
a
clear
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
seizure.
and
the
individual
brought
suit
against
the
property
custodian
and
said
i
want
my
property
back.
would
it
be
a
sufficient
eleventh
amendment
defense
for
the
state
to
come
and
say
well,
that
property's
in
the
custody
of
the
state,
period?
that's
your
position,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
earlier
in
your
argument
say
you
agreed
with
ex
parte
young?
unknown
speaker
do
you
still?
do
you
still
agree
with
it?
unknown
speaker
after
that
answer.
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
of
florida
differ
from
other
states
that
operate
only
through
their
officials?
