mr.
david
paul
horan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
fourth
major
appellate
argument
in
this
action.
it
was
filed
nearly
seven
years
ago,
and
i
filed
it.
the
case
is
not
concerning
a
question
of
the
relative
merits
of
federal
and
state
government,
but
a
question
of
the
right
of
an
individual
against
the
massive
power
of
the
state
of
florida.
it
involves
the
protection
of
private
property
rights
and
the
power
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
determine
constitutional
jurisdiction
over
admiralty
and
maritime
claims.
now,
the
wreck
of
the
nuestra
senora
de
atocha
was
found
after
three
years
of
search
by
treasure
salvors,
and
as
previously
determined
by
this
court,
it
was
outside
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states
and
that
of
florida.
the
factual
findings
of
the
trial
court
have
for
the
most
part
not
even
been
attacked
on
appeal,
and
none
have
ever
been
found
to
contain
any
error.
the
38-page
memorandum
of
the
trial
court
discloses
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
relevant
factual
situations
you
could
ever
believe
which
must
form
the
background
of
this
court's
final
and
at
last
unappealable
opinion.
the
atocha's
association
with
florida
was
tangential
at
best.
when
it
sank
in
1622
it
was
outside
the
boundaries
of
a
continent,
largely
unexplored,
which
was
much
later
to
be
called
florida.
the
state
of
florida
did
not
research,
they
did
not
find,
and
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
for
even
suggesting
they
could
have
found
it,
much
less
recovered
it.
the
trial
court
in
its
november
21st,
1978
order
states
as
follows:
"merely
because
the
agents
of
the
state
covet
the
treasure
does
not
give
the
agents
the
right
to
take
it
in
the
name
of
the
state.
"
and
the
court
went
on
to
say:
"it's
ironic
that
the
agents
of
the
state
are
able
to
use
resources
of
the
state
to
deprive
treasure
salvors
of
what
it
justfully
and
rightfully
owns,
especially
when
the
record
reflects
that
treasure
salvors
was
at
one
time
willing
to
donate
a
portion
of
the
salvage
vessel
to
the
state.
"
now,
the
record
reflects
that
the
state
of
florida
and
the
united
states
were
working
secretly
in
1975
to
completely
vest
title
in
the
united
states
with
florida
having
the
exclusive
right
to
continue
the
salvage
started
by
treasure
salvors
four
years
before.
when
these
covert
activities
were
discovered,
treasure
salvors
filed
its
in
rem
action
against
the
atocha,
and
this
court
ruled
on
florida's
boundaries
in
u.s.
v.
florida,
and
the
state
rushed
at
that
point,
knowing
that
it
was
losing,
under
its
contract
which
said
that
we
had
the
right
to
do
out
and
salvage
on
state
owned
sovereign
submerged
lands
if
we
paid
them
$1,200
a
year,
the
state
at
that
time
rushed
to
divide
much
of
the
salvaged
treasure.
but
they
were
only
dividing...
they
had
everything
that
we
had
recovered.
they
had
never
given
us
a
division.
we
had
asked
for
a
division
over
and
over
and
over
again.
and
they
talk
about
these
series
of
contracts.
the
reason
there
was
a
series
of
contracts
is
that
there
was
a
total
forfeiture
provision
if
we
stopped
short
of
a
total
recovery;
so
we
had
no
option
but
to
continue
the
salvage.
and
then
with
their
plan...
and
the
trial
court
found
that
this
was
an
ongoing
plan
to
keep
all
of
it,
and
that
was
a
factual
finding
of
the
trial
court
after
the
evidentiary
hearing.
but
what
happened
was
one
week
prior
to
this
court
issuing
its
opinion,
after
the
oral
arguments
and
after
they
went
back
and
said
boy,
we
just
got
cleaned,
the
state
rushed
to
try
this
division;
but
they
only
divided
about
80
percent
of
what
was
up
there,
and
they
kept
the
rest.
now,
frustrated
in
its
desire
to
obtain
the
entire
treasure,
the
state
encouraged
and
worked
with
the
united
states
to
claim
everything,
past,
present,
and
future.
there
were
negotiations
which
mike
reed
talks
about
in
the
san
diego
law
review,
the
assistant
solicitor
of
the
united
states,
when
the
state
of
florida
comes
up
and
says
hey,
listen,
we've
lost
this
thing;
you've
got
to
protect
our
interest.
now,
after
extensive
evidentiary
hearings
the
trial
court
found
that
the
state
chose
not
to
enter
a
claim
but
to
rely
upon
the
united
states
to
win
the
suit.
and
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
decide
how
they
were
going
to
divide
up
the
spoils
once
the
united
states
won.
mr.
david
paul
horan
yes,
it
does,
because
there
is
no
eleventh
amendment,
justice
rehnquist,
if
it's
between
the
united
states
and
florida.
see,
the
united
states
came
in
and
claimed--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--and
so
certainly
there
would
be
no
eleventh
amendment;
if
the
united
states
had
won
their
claim
saying
they
were
the
owner,
then
they'd
have
come
down
and
just
said
okay,
that's
ours.
mr.
david
paul
horan
right.
the
factual
assertion
or
the
factual
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
the
state
of
florida
was
in
privity
with
the
united
states
puts
it
foreclosed,
because
at
that
point
the
united
states
was
urging
florida's
claim.
mr.
david
paul
horan
no,
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
rested
primarily
on
the
fact
that
the
court
must
have
jurisdiction
at
least
to
find
out
the
propriety
of
the
claim
being
put
forward,
and
that's
why
u.s.
v.
lee
is
so
much
on
point.
the
state,
after
all
this
litigation,
tremendous
amount
of
litigation,
working
with
the
federal
government
in
this
two
and
a
half
years
of
litigation,
then
after
the
litigation
is
decided
in
a
manner
which
the
state
didn't
like
at
all,
tried
to
paint
themselves
as
total
strangers
to
litigation.
and
the
trial
court
on
page
7
of
its
opinion
says,
"it
ill
behooves
the
division
of
archives
to
play
such
a
fast
and
loose
game
with
the
courts.
"
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
state
knew
that
the
title
to
all
past
salvage
was
being
litigated
in
this
suit.
had
the
original
case
been
decided
as
hoped
for
by
the
division
of
archives,
there
would
have
been
no
eleventh
amendment
available
to
attempt
to
hold
those
portions
of
the
salvage
against
the
united
states.
mr.
david
paul
horan
sir?
mr.
david
paul
horan
that
would
be
page
7
of
the
trial
court's
opinion.
that
would
be--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--yes,
sir.
that
would
have
been
the
opinion
of
the
28th
of
august
1976.
mr.
david
paul
horan
it
would
be
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
david
paul
horan
the
trial
court
found
that
florida
was
bound
for
failing
to
intervene
and
its
participation
in
the
previous
litigation.
the
trial
court
held
that
the
extent
of
the
state's
entanglement
and
reliance
on
the
federal
government
in
this
case
quite
simply
serves
to
highlight
the
fact
that
equitable
principles
call
for
the
division
to
be
bound.
equity
does
cry
out
for
treasure
salvors
to
keep
the
property
that
it's
paid
so
dearly
to
find
and
possess.
mr.
david
paul
horan
yes,
sir.
it
is.
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
federal
courts
have
been
in
the
middle
of
a
modern
tragedy
and
a
real
tragedy
that
has
unfolded
not
only
in
the
federal
courthouse
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
but
40
miles
west
of
key
west
out
on
the
high
seas,
on
the
continental
shelf
of
the
united
states
outside
florida.
the
world
learned
in
the
federal
district
court
during
the
court's
time
of
the
striking
of
the
salvage
vessel
north
wind
and
it
going
down
with
mel
fisher,
the
president
of
treasure
salvors
son,
dirk
fisher,
his
wife,
angel,
and
a
young
diver,
rick
gage.
after
the
funerals
the
search
and
the
salvage
went
on
in
this
case,
and
certainly
they
wouldn't
have
had
it
any
other
way.
after
receiving
a
mandate
in
the
fifth
circuit
it
was
clear
that
the
court
had
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
that
salvage.
an
ancillary
process
was
authorized,
directed
the
two
individuals
holding
the
salvage
in
tallahassee...
not
the
state
of
florida
but
two
individuals,
ross
morrell
and
james
macbeth.
now,
the
state
attempted
to
block
the
service
of
that
writ
on
those
two
individuals,
even
including
emergency
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit;
but
the
fifth
circuit
refused,
and
it
said
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
for
the
district
court
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
such
record
as
may
be
developed
in
the
trial
court.
the
only
real
question
before
the
court
today
is
jurisdiction.
does
the
trial
court
dismiss
a
salvage
action
after
a
mere
suggestion
by
the
state
that
it
owns
the
salvage?
that
is,
may
admiralty
courts
look
beyond
a
mere
assertion
of
title
to
see
if
a
claim
is
valid?
during
the
360
years
that
the
atocha
spent
down
there--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--the
state
actually
forced
itself
to
become
involved.
it
was
very
similar
to--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--no,
it
didn't.
it
didn't.
because
once
the
two
officials,
once
these
two
men
that
the
writ
was
directed
to
were
forced
to
give
up
the
treasure,
the
state
came
in
and
said
that's
ours.
they
filed
a
claim
to
the
vessel
and
said
that
vessel
is
ours,
and
everything
that
came
up
from
it
is
ours,
and
it's
ours
completely.
mr.
david
paul
horan
yes,
sir.
absolutely.
we
did
the
writ
to
those
two
individuals.
then
the
state
comes
in,
and
they
say
hey,
you
can't
take
that
because
it
belongs
to
the
state.
mr.
david
paul
horan
the
pleading
that
they
filed
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
writ
of
attachment,
the
warrant
of
arrest,
the
ancillary
warrant.
mr.
david
paul
horan
on
the
ground
that
they
owned
it.
mr.
david
paul
horan
now,
it
was
later
that
they
urged
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
david
paul
horan
no,
sir.
mr.
david
paul
horan
that's
correct.
mr.
david
paul
horan
that's
correct.
during
the
360
years
that
the
atocha
spent
abandoned
on
the
high
seas,
all
ownership
was
lost.
it
was
the
property
of
no
one.
the
finder
and
salvager
was
treasure
salvors,
and
it
filed
its
in
rem
claim
against
the
vessel
claiming
ownership
and
validation
of
past
and
future
salvage
rights.
at
separate
times
the
state
of
florida
and
the
united
states
filed
claims
of
ownership
in
the
cause.
the
federal
claim
was
grounded
on
the
sovereign
prerogative
of
the
english
kings.
the
federal
claim
was
found
to
be
entirely
groundless.
the
state's
claim
was
based
on
the
state's
exercise
of
its
sovereign
prerogative.
however,
the
state
statute
even
if
constitutionally
valid
by
its
own
terms
did
not
apply
to
areas
outside
state
territorial
waters.
the
first
paragraph
of
the
contract
says
that
they're
talking
about
only
state
owned
submerged
lands.
the
issue
of
the
salvage
of
other
vessels
outside
the
territorial
sea
is
presently
pending
before
the
eleventh
circuit.
now,
much
of
the
state's
argument
in
its
reply
brief
and
certainly
a
lot
of
the
argument
of
the
amici
in
this
case
centers
on
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
the
salvage
within
territorial
boundaries.
that
is
presently
pending,
and
i
have
available
the
opinion
of
judge
james
lawerence
king
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida
which
is
on
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit...
briefs
have
not
been
submitted
at
this
time...
which
has
to
do
with
inside
state
waters.
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
salvage,
a
traditional
maritime
activity,
on
the
continental
shelf
of
the
united
states
outside
the
state
of
florida.
now,
the
state's
argument
does
not
even
dispute
or
even
discuss
in
the
entire
reply
brief
that
the
wreck
is
outside
state
waters.
it
doesn't
even
mention
that
fact.
it
does
not
dispute
the
florida
statute
267
only
applies
to
wrecks
on
state
owned
lands,
nor
do
they
dispute
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
holding
the
salvage
contract
was
invalid
on
five
separate
grounds,
nor
do
they
dispute
that
the
salvaged
articles
had
been
forcefully
taken
by
state
agents
who
were
not
entitled
to
ownership
or
possession.
and
finally,
after
so
much
argument
below,
the
state
never
even
mentions
the
queen
city
cases...
now,
this
is
in
their
reply
brief...
the
navemar,
which
is
the
spanish
ship;
in
re
muir,
which
is
the
glen
eden,
the
british
ship;
and
the
baja,
california,
the
mexican
ship...
which
hold
that
ownership...
every
one
of
these
are
cases
out
of
the
supreme
court
here
that
say
that
ownership
is
a
jurisdictional
fact
that
must
be
established
before
sovereign
immunity
or
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense.
mr.
david
paul
horan
well,
the
queen
city
case
said
absent
a
special
challenge,
we're
going
to
accept
that.
and
it
wasn't
even
raised
that
there
was
a
problem
with
ownership
until
the
appellate
time.
mr.
david
paul
horan
i
do,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
trial
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
so
held.
mr.
david
paul
horan
certainly.
i
read
the
queen
city
cases
very
similarly
to
say
that
ownership
is
the
pivotal
issue
on
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
applies,
and
if
there
is
a
showing
of
ownership,
then
the
eleventh
amendment
is
going
to
apply.
but
that
is
a
jurisdictional
fact.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
difference
between
sovereign
immunity
of
a
foreign
state
and
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
in
both
of
these
there
are
similarities
in
both
of
them.
the
application
of
sovereign
immunity
of
foreign
nation
or
foreign
state
or
whatever,
or
the
eleventh
amendment
turn
on
the
question
of
the
ownership.
if
there
is
ownership
and
there
is
public
service,
then
the
eleventh
amendment
applies.
if
there
is
not
ownership
and
there
is
not
public
service,
if
these
people
are
holding
it
wrongfully,
as
they
did
in
lee--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--well,
i
would
say
this.
i
would
say
that
the
colorable
claim,
if
there
is
a
challenge...
now,
the
colorable
claim,
we're
not
talking
about
getting
into
the
whole
litigation
at
this
point.
we're
talking
about
whether
it
applies,
and
the
court's
making
this
jurisdictional
fact
determination
of
jurisdiction.
at
that
point
i
think
that
when
the
state
came
up
and
said
here
we
have
a
contract,
the
federal
court
is
not--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--okay.
if
you
come
up
and
you
say
okay,
this
property
which
is
in
the
possession,
and
you
allege
in
the
wrongful
possession,
of
these
state
agents
here
and
that
you
own
it,
now
this
property
here
belongs
to
the
state
and
here's
a
contract,
and
it
says
that
the
property
belongs
to
the
state,
and
the
court
looks
at
that
contract.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
put
on
blinders.
i
think
when
the
first
paragraph
of
the
contract
says
something
which
is
just
completely
outrageous
like
we
don't
really
own
this
and
we're
just
taking
it
because
we
want
it,
even
though
that
might
be
in
the
contract,
i
think
the
federal
court
has
the
right
to
look
at
that
and
say
well,
okay,
if
that's
what
you
say.
now
then
the
other
party
can
come
in
and
say
listen,
that
contract
right
there
is
a
forgery.
those
state
agents
that
are
in
possession
on
that
did
not
have
the
right
to
make
us
sign
that.
we
were
coerced
into
signing
that
contract.
they
can't
use
that
coercion
to
deprive
this
court
of
jurisdiction
over
a
traditional
maritime
claim
out
on
the
continental
shelf
of
the
united
states
outside
florida
boundaries.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
did.
mr.
david
paul
horan
well,
my
version
of
eleventh
amendment
application--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--well,
i
believe
that's
right.
i
think
that
what
the
court
of
appeals,
and
what
i'm
insisting
on
is
that
florida's
unsupported
claim
of
ownership
is
at
best
clothed
with
the
presumption
of
validity
that
if
duly
challenged
and
rebutted
cannot
operate
as
a
jurisdictional
bar.
because
florida's
claim
of
ownership
was
duly
challenged,
the
question
of
ownership
was
a
jurisdictional
matter
to
be
judicially
resolved
on
evidence
to
be
presented.
now,
in
this
matter
the
state
has
not
even
attacked
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
which
overwhelmingly
controvert
the
state's
claim
of
ownership.
mr.
david
paul
horan
i
don't
believe
so,
because
i
think
the
eleventh
amendment
turns
on
the
ownership
argument.
if
it
is
not
owned
by
the
state,
if
it
is
being
improperly
held
by
the
state,
there
is
no
eleventh
amendment
argument.
it's
the
tinsdale
case,
and
the
tinsdale
case
is
directly
on
point.
here
you
had
two
state
officers
who
were
in
possession
of
some
property,
and
the
court
came
along
and
said
you're
in
possession
of
that
property,
and
they
said
oh,
yes,
but
we're
state
officials
and
it's
state
property.
well,
in
the
tinsdale
case
the
only
difference
is
that
instead
of
pursuing
all
the
way
through
the
litigation
like
florida
did,
in
tinsdale
the
state
came
in
and
filed
an
eleventh
amendment
defense
and
said
we
are
the
owner,
but
the
eleventh
amendment
means
that
we
don't
have
to
get
into
it.
and
the
court
looked
at
that
and
said
okay,
stay
out
of
it.
and
they
looked
into
it
and
said
those
people
do
not
own
it;
they
are
in
wrongful
possession
of
that
property;
get
off.
the
fact
is
that
the
state
of
florida
was
not
a
necessary
party
to
this
litigation.
they
chose
to
come
in
and
assert
their
claim
and
say
we
own
the
whole
wreck
and
everything.
the
fact
is
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
some
property
that
came
from
a
marine
salvage
operation.
now,
that's
what
it
was.
that
was
the
res
over
which
that
we
were
fighting.
we
never
sued
the
state
of
florida,
never.
it
was
them
coming
in
affirmatively.
the
sovereign
immunity
rested
in
many
cases.
we
can
go
back
and
see
that
the
sovereign
immunity
rested
on
the
structure
of
the
feudal
system,
the
fiction
that
the
king
could
do
no
wrong.
yet,
this
court's
doctrine
in
ex
parte
young
is
an
integral
part
of
our
judicial
fabric.
neither
sovereign
immunity
nor
the
eleventh
amendment
will
bar
a
suit
in
federal
court
for
relief
against
the
wrongdoing
of
state
or
federal
officials.
in
this
particular
case
there
was--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--well,
the
only
party
for
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--well,
the
only
reason
that
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--yes.
the
reason
was
because
that's
the
only
parties
that
were
before
the
court.
see,
the
state
took
the
reins
away
from
the
two
people
that
had
possession,
and
they
filed
their
claim
of
ownership,
so
the
only
people
before--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--well,
it
was
in
the
possession
of
mr.
morrell
and
mr.
o'brien
who
were
state
officials
of
the
department
of--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--okay.
without
conceding
the
constitutionality
of
florida
statute,
the
case
resembles
and
is
on
point
with
a
case
that
was
decided
14
years
before
this
court
decided
ex
parte
young,
and
that
was
reagan
v.
farmers
loan
and
trust
company,
154
u.s.
362.
and
this
court
held
then
that
a
valid
law
may
be
wrongfully
administered
by
officers
of
the
state
so
as
to
make
such
administration
an
illegal
burden
and
an
exaction
on
the
individual.
they
may
go
beyond
the
powers
thereby
conferred,
and
when
they
do
the
fact
that
they
are
assuming
to
act
under
a
valid
law
will
not
oust
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
to
restrain
their
excessive
and
illegal
acts.
now,
under
the
reasoning
of
ex
parte
young,
the
state
had
no
interest
in
the
lawsuit
for
it
was
incapable
of
authorizing
an
unconstitutional
act.
the
suit
began
when
an
ancillary
writ
was
issued
to
mr.
morrell
and
mr.
macbeth.
now,
the
claim
made
by
the
united
states
when
the
case
was
first
filed
and
when
the
united
states
came
in,
they
said
move
to
dismiss,
sovereign
immunity;
we
are
the
owner.
that's
what
the
united
states
said.
and
ultimately
when
we
got
into
the
merits,
because
we
went
into
the
merits,
the
court
said
listen,
i'm
not
going
to
decide
this
on
the
bare
claim
that
the
united
states
is
an
owner.
why
are
you
the
owner?
and
they
said
1906
antiquities
act.
and
so
ultimately
we
got
actually
a
summary
judgment
against
the
united
states,
and
it
was
upheld
by
the
fifth
circuit,
and
they
sought
to
come
before
this
court.
in
this
particular
case
the
state
says
well,
because
the
united
states
failed
in
its
claim,
we
should
be
the
ones.
there
must
be
a
bureaucracy
out
there
that
can
govern
that
wreck;
but
in
fact,
the
state
cannot
enforce
anything
out
there.
they
cannot
protect
that
wreck.
the
federal
court
can
enforce
and
can
protect.
that's
treasure
salvors
iii.
we've
had
some
panamanian
pirates
out
there
during
the
interim
and
had
to
go
against
them,
and
it
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
you've
got
the
jurisdiction.
now,
the
fundamental
issues
here
are
do
the
rules
established
in
queen
city
and
in
tindal
v.
wesley,
do
they
hold
that
the
mere
assertion
of
title
in
the
state
bars
eleventh
amendment
ground
suits
against
the
state
and
state
officers
where
the
claim
is
specifically
challenged.
now,
the
issue
here,
as
in
tinsdale,
is
whether
there
is
an
action
brought
against
individuals
to
recover
the
possession
of
land
which
they
have
in
their
possession
and
control
is
to
be
deemed
an
action
against
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
simply
because
those
individuals
claim
to
be
in
rightful
possession
as
officers
of
the
state
and
that
title
is
in
the
state.
and
can
the
court
decline
to
inquire
whether
the
individual
defendants
are
in
law
entitled
to
possession.
mr.
david
paul
horan
right.
on
their
motion.
they
came
in.
they
did
not
have
to.
they
came
in
and
intervened
and
said
we
are
filing
a
claim
of
owner.
mr.
david
paul
horan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
particular
case
where
the
state
came
in,
the
state
came
in
and
said
we
are
the
owner.
later
they
assert
eleventh
amendment.
they
say
we
are
the
owner,
and
we're
going
to
act
for
those
individuals.
we're
not
going
to
let
those
people
file
any
responses.
we
can't
tell
who
to
file
responses.
we're
not
going
to
let
those
people
file
responses.
we
are
going
to
file
responses
on
their
behalf.
and
that's
what
they
did.
now,
the
state
intervened
asserting
on
behalf
of
itself
and
those
named
individuals
title.
in
this
particular
case
do
the
principles
of
queen
city
and
tindal
apply,
where
the
state's
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
or
eleventh
amendment
rests
upon
the
validity
of
this
title
and
the
state
statute
upon
which
that
rests.
isn't
this
the
special
challenge?
over
the
last
60
years
this
court
has
had
at
least
three
admiralty
actions
where
the
ownership
of
a
vessel
determined
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction:
in
re
muir
where
the
glen
eden
was
alleged
to
be
in
british
service,
and
britain
came
in
and
said
that's
ours;
you
must
dismiss
on
sovereign
immunity
grounds;
the
navemar,
which
is
a
1938
case,
where
spain
came
in
and
said
eleventh...
or
not
eleventh
amendment
but
sovereign
immunity;
you
must
dismiss;
republic
of
mexico
versus
hoffman
where
the
republic
of
mexico
had
a
contract
over
the
baja,
california,
the
ship
in
that,
which
was
claimed
by
mexico.
in
all
three
of
those
this
court
said
that
britain,
spain,
and
mexico's
claim
of
ownership
must
decide...
the
court,
the
trial
court
must
decide
for
itself
whether
the
requisites
of
immunity
exist.
the
trial
court
has
never
been
bound
to
accept
an
ownership
allegation
is
conclusive.
now,
we
get
into
one
other
line
of
cases,
and
that
is
o'neill
v.
schoenbrod.
mr.
david
paul
horan
no,
sir.
the
biggest
damage
in
the
whole
world
would
be
that
envisioned
in
the
lee
case
where
if
you
allow
a
state
to
come
in
with
the
mere
assertion
of
ownership,
to
divest
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction
to
protect
somebody's
individual
rights,
you
are
leading
justice
into
a
blind
alley
from
which
it
will
never
emerge.
in
this
particular
case
you've
got
the
florida
courts
in
o'neill
v.
schoenbrod
which
state
very
conclusively
that
admiralty
salvage...
that
salvage
is
a
creature
of
the
federal
courts,
and
the
courts
of
florida
will
not
even
entertain
a
claim
for
salvage.
and
what
other
than
a
claim
for
salvage
is
a
salvage
contract
to
salvage
a
boat
on
the
continental
shelf
of
the
united
states
outside
of
florida?
and
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
david
paul
horan
--well,
everything
was
delivered
to
florida.
they
took
it
all.
mr.
david
paul
horan
yes.
mr.
david
paul
horan
they
have
no
jurisdiction
over
salvage
contracts.
under
o'neill
v.
schoenbrod
they
dismissed
it
the
first
time
because
it
was
styled
an
in
personam
between
o'neill
and
schoenbrod
on
salvage.
they
dismissed
it.
and
o'neill
and
schoenbrod
must
have
had
attorneys
that
didn't
want
to
go
into
federal
court
because
they
tried
to
refile
it
on
unjust
enrichment.
this
was
something
that
had
already
been
accomplished.
and
the
florida
court
again,
the
trial
court
and
the
third
district
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
action
again
saying
listen,
you're
just
trying
to
disguise
a
salvage
action,
and
if
we
entertain
jurisdiction,
we
would
be
getting
into
a
jurisdictional
conflict
with
the
federal
courts,
because
the
federal
courts
have
a
unique
way
of
looking
at
federal
salvage
contracts
and
pure
salvage,
because
there
is
a
unique
way
of
looking
at
that
and
determining
the
distribution
of
the
goods
salved,
whether
it
is
perspective
or
retrospective
in
effect.
and
in
o'neill
v.
schoenbrod
that's
exactly
what
happened.
they
said
you
can't
even
disguise
it
as
unjust
enrichment.
in
fact
you
are
talking
about
salvage.
there
is
no
doubt
in
this
particular
case
we
are
talking
about
salvage.
in
conclusion,
treasure
salvors
i
was
the
case
where
the
united
states
lost
its
claim
that
it
could
control
salvage
operation
on
the
high
seas
under
the
1906
act
giving
jurisdiction
over
lands
owned
or
controlled
by
the
united
states.
now
florida
insists
that
it
has
greater
control
over
salvage
on
the
high
seas
than
the
united
states.
the
trial
court's
holding
that
the
state
was
in
privity
with
the
united
states
and
was
bound
also
for
failure
to
intervene
is
a
valid
basis
to
affirm
the
lower
court's
opinion
because
it
would
obviate
the
eleventh
amendment
arguments
made
by
florida.
if
the
state
had
intervened
claiming
against
the
united
states,
there
would
have
been
no
eleventh
amendment
defense,
and
the
state
litigated
by
proxy,
and
it
litigated
very
hard
by
proxy
and
it
lost,
and
now
they
want
to
play
another
fast
and
loose
game.
mr.
david
paul
horan
thank
you.
