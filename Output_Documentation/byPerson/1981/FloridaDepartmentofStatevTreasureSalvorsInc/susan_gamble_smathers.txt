ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
central
issue
involved
in
this
petition
is
whether
the
federal
courts
below
exceeded
the
bounds
of
their
constitutional
authority
attesting
the
validity
of
an
apparently
sufficient
contract
which
was
the
basis
for
the
state's
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
court's
authority
is
limited
to
determining
whether
the
state
has
an
genuine
interest
in
the
subject
matter
of
a
dispute,
and
that
once
the
state's
interest
is
demonstrated,
even
though
there
may
be
defenses
that
may
be
asserted
in
another
forum,
that
the
inquiry
of
the
federal
court
should
cease.
this
court
does
not
sit
today
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
parties'
contractual
dispute;
rather,
the
people
of
the
state
of
florida
deserve
to
have
a
dispute
over
the
ownership
of
historic
artifacts,
on
display
in
many
instances
in
their
state
museum,
decided
in
a
state
court
which
is
fully
equipped
to
hear
the
issue
and
which,
it
must
be
assumed,
can
reach
a
decision
which
meets
the
ends
of
justice.
briefly,
the
facts
are
in
1622
a
flotilla
of
28
spanish
ships
was
proceeding
through
the
florida
straits
and
encountered
a
hurricane.
eight
of
the
ships
were
lost.
one
of
the
ships,
which
was
not
subsequently
recovered
by
the
spaniards,
was
the
nuestra
senora
de
atocha.
she
went
down
with
a
precious
metal
cargo
as
well
as
a
vast
amount
of
artifacts
from
the
17th
century
which
today
may
be
worth
as
much
as
$400
million.
certainly
the
archaeological
significance
of
those
artifacts
could
have
no
price
tag
put
on
them.
in
1971
under
the
authority
of
florida's
antiquities
legislation
the
state
of
florida
department
of
state
entered
into
a
contract
with
respondents
to
search
for
and
later
recover
the
remains
of
the
atocha.
under
the
contract
the
state
was
to
retain
25
percent
of
the
artifacts
recovered,
and
the
respondents
were
to
be
paid
in
kind
for
their
services
consisting
of
75
percent
of
the
artifacts.
then
in
march
1975
united
states
v.
florida
was
handed
down
which
re
established
florida's
boundaries
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
it
was
at
this
point
that
respondents
filed
an
in
rem
complaint
in
admiralty
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
for
possession
and
confirmation
of
title
to
the
remains
of
the
atocha.
what
is
important
for
this
court
to
understand
was
that
respondents'
in
rem
complaint
sought
possession
and
title
to
the
unidentified
remains
of
a
vessel
which
were
scattered
below
on
the
ocean
floor.
the
artifacts
in
dispute
in
today's
action
were
not
in
dispute
in
that
case.
florida
was
not
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
well,
your
honor,
at
that
time--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--that's
right.
it
was
a
policy
decision.
certainly
the
state
recognized
that
their
authority
to
continue
exercising
jurisdiction
in
those
waters
was
drawn
seriously
in
question.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
certainly.
the
united
states
did
intervene
in
that
proceeding
and
claimed
ownership
of
the
wreck
under
the
federal
antiquities
act
and
the
abandoned
properties
act.
there
had
never
before
this
time
been
any
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
florida
as
to
who
could
exercise
ownership
or
control
of
these
artifacts.
the
united
states
intervened,
as
i
said,
and
claimed
ownership
under
the
antiquities
act
and
the
abandoned
properties
act.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
certainly--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--well,
i
would
say
no.
i
will
say
that
all
of
the
parties,
including
the
respondents,
met
in
washington
sometime
before
the
initiation
of
these
suits
to
talk
about
the
wrecks,
to
talk
about
who
would
own
them
and
to
try
to
work
out
some
agreement
over
who
could
salvage
the
wrecks.
at
some
point
that
broke
down
and
respondents
filed
their
complaint
in
rem
in
the
southern
district
court
for
possession
and
title.
but
as
i
say,
that
in
rem
complaint
sought
ownership
of
that
which
had
not
even
been
raised
yet.
the
ownership
of
these
artifacts
was
not
in
question
in
that
proceeding.
florida,
at
that
point
having
made
a
decision
no
longer
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
that
area,
did
not
intervene
in
the
proceeding
because
the
artifacts
under
which
possession
had
already
passed
to
the
state
and
were
in
fact
being
worked
on
in
the
state
laboratory,
in
some
cases
already
on
display,
those
artifacts
were
not
in
dispute.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
they
came
into
possession
under
the
contracts
in
which
both
parties
agreed
at
that
time
that
the
atocha
lay
on
sovereignty
submerged
lands
owned
by
the
state
of
florida.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that
is
right,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
right.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
no,
your
honor.
and,
in
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
when
it
affirmed
that
case
or
affirmed
the
trial
court
holding
as
between
treasure
salvors
and
the
united
states,
expressly
held
that
we
do
not
approve
that
portion
of
the
trial
court's
order
which
held
that
respondents
had
title
against
all
the
world.
we
do
not
address
any
rights
of
ownership
as
to
parties
which
are
not
before
us.
and
that's
very
clear
in
their
opinion.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
certainly.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
no,
your
honor,
unless
by
the
fact
that
the
respondents
were
a
contracting
party
with
the
state.
by
virtue
that
the
state
of
florida
was
their
principal
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
we
had
possession
of
all
of
them.
however,
the
state
had
an
agent
on
board
the
vessel
at
the
time
that
all
of
these
artifacts
were
recovered,
and
divisions
were
to
be
conducted
under
the
contracts
at
different
times,
periodically
at
mutually
agreed
upon
times.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
there
may
be
that
allegation,
your
honor,
but
it's
strongly
contested
by
the
state.
we
undertook
the
divisions,
as
we
do
today,
with
15
other
salvage
companies
working
off
the
coast.
there's
no
dispute.
it's
in
the
contract.
the
parties
each
choose
an
appraiser,
and
they
each
choose
a
third.
artifacts
are
given
a
point
value.
the
most
valuable
artifact
gets
a
high
point
value;
the
lowest
value
gets
a
low
point
value.
everything
else
is
put
in
between,
and
the
75/25
split
is
made
on
that
basis.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
well,
certainly
at
that
time
it
was
the
state
of
florida's
belief
that
they
had
absolute
control
and
ownership
over
that
area,
and
if
respondents
were
found
to
have
been
salvaging
in
an
area
without
a
contract,
yes,
they
would
have
been
arrested.
that
was
the
law.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
i
think
that
whether
or
not
it's
a
valid
contract
should
be
decided
in
a
state
court.
we
have
a
vast
amount
of
contract
jurisprudence
in
the
state
of
florida
which
a
state
court
is
certainly
willing
and
able
to
decide.
and
this
was
a
dispute...
if
the
basis
of
the
parties'
dispute
was
a
recision
of
the
contract
based
on
a
mistake
of
fact
or
it
could
be
argued
a
mistake
of
law,
then
that
dispute
is
certainly
to
be
determined
in
a
state
court.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
no.
that
is
their
share.
they
only
have
25
percent
of
the
artifacts
which
they
recovered
pursuant
to
four
years
of
contracts
with
the
respondents.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
twenty-five
percent
of
what
had
been
recovered
up
to
that
time,
yes.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that
is
absolutely
correct.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
no,
they
have
not,
although
it
has
been
contemplated
and
in
fact
gone
so
far
as
to
have
complaints
drawn
up.
they
have
not
to
date.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
no.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
oh,
yes.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
well,
the
parties
differ
on
their
assessment
of
the
value.
it
could
be
as
much
as
$13
million.
it
could
be
$2
million.
certainly,
as
i
have
stated--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--no.
what
is
in
dispute
today.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
the
total,
including
what's
in
dispute
today
as
well
as
that
which
is
still
in
the
ocean,
could
be
as
much
as
$400
million.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
right.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
not
yet.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
well,
the
parties
quit
dealing
in
1975
right
after
u.s.
v.
florida
came
down.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
right.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
treasure
salvors,
the
respondents,
have
continued
to
work
on
the
wreck
site,
and
what
they
brought
up
is
presumably
in
their
possession.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
your
honor,
we
make
that
argument
to
show
that
at
least
we
had
a
colorable
claim
to
those
artifacts,
at
least
it
didn't
deserve
to
be
dismissed
in
so
cavalier
a
fashion
as
to
say
well--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--it
was
a
policy
decision
made
by
the
state
at
that
time,
made
by
the
administration
of
the
department
of
state
not
to
pursue
it
until
the
issue
had
been
clearly
settled.
we
would
argue
that
under
the
submerged
lands
act
that...
or
at
least
we
could
make
the
argument
that
the
submerged
lands
act
applies
to
natural
resources
and
that
the
state
may
in
fact
be
able
to
continue
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
those
waters.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
certainly,
but
that's
not
what's
in
dispute
in
this
case.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that
is
exactly
right.
i
concede
that
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
atocha
lies
in
florida
waters
or
not,
but
i
would
also
make
the
argument
that
these
parties
contracted
on
the
basis
of
the
state's
constitutional
boundaries
as
they
were
in
1868
when
florida
was
readmitted
to
the
union,
which
boundaries
congress
approved
in
order
to
be
readmitted,
and
that
it
was
the
submerged
lands
act
which
has
some
very
specific
language
that
compelled
the
special
master
to
draw
an
insular
pocket
of
jurisdiction
around
the
dry
tortugas
islands
and
then
to
draw
a
line
over
here
around
the
end
of
the
keys,
and
to
hold
that
under
the
submerged
lands
act
that
florida
could
not
own
the
land
in
between
those
two
pieces
of
territory
because
of
the
three
mile
three
league
provision
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
but
the
boundaries
is
not
something
that
we
dreamed
up
for
purposes
of
salvaging
the
atocha;
in
fact,
the
state's
constitution
today,
if
you
look
at
a
geodetic
map
it's
going
to
show
that
the
state's
boundaries
go
all
the
way
from
the
marquesas
keys
all
the
way
and
including
the
waters
in
between
the
marquesas
and
the
dry
tortugas,
which
is
where
the
atocha
is
found.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
i
would
think
that
under
alabama
v.
pugh
we
would
have
a
defense
if
the
state
of
florida
was
the
party
or
if
the
state
of
florida
department
of
state
was
a
party.
had
it
been
an
injunction
against
a
specific
official,
perhaps
under
many
cases
in
this
court
it
would
lie.
however,
the
contract
entered
into
by
these
parties
was
between
the
state
of
florida
department
of
state
and
the
respondents.
it
wasn't
entered
into
by
the
secretary
of
state
or
by
the
director
of
the
division
of
archives.
and
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
held
below,
or
it
certainly
could
be
construed
in
the
future
to
hold
that
if
a
party
wants
to
rescind
a
contract
or
if
they
want
to
question
the
state's
title
to
property,
that
they
can
now
go
into
federal
court
and
do
that
if
they
win
or
if
the
federal
court
is
persuaded
that
they
may
have
the
more
persuasive
argument.
but
under
the
eleventh
amendment
we
have
a
right
to
assert
a
losing
argument
in
state
court.
and
judge
rubin
below
in
dissent
expressed
it
very
well
when
he
said
that
the
rule
now
of
the
majority
is
that
suits
against
the
state
are
permitted
by
the
eleventh
amendment
if
the
result
is
that
the
state
loses.
i
think
that's
going
much
further
than
any
of
the
cases
of
this
court
have
indicated.
and
certainly
in
the
edelman
decision,
while
these
facts
are
not
covered
by
the
edelman
decision,
edelman
did
state
that
the
eleventh
amendment
declares
a
policy
of
such
compelling
force
that
it
is
an
explicit
limitation
on
federal
courts.
and
in
light
of
that
thinking
and
that
policy
we
think
that
the
court
in
this
case
overstepped
the
bounds
of
its
inquiry.
the
court
below
justified
its
position
that
the
eleventh
amendment
did
not
apply
to
the
dispute
based
upon
its
reading
of
a
1921
decision
in
re
new
york,
and
the
court
below
took
this
decision
to
mean
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
merely
a
rebuttable
presumption
which
may
be
defeated
upon
a
showing
of
facts
that
it
believed
can
refute
a
claim
of
state
ownership
of
property.
in
re
new
york
held
that
the
verified
suggestion
of
ownership
filed
by
new
york's
attorney
general
as
to
state
ownership
of
a
tugboat
in
that
case
was
sufficient
evidence
of
state
ownership
to
trigger
the
eleventh
amendment,
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
special
challenge.
it
was
the
special
challenge
language
that
allowed
the
fifth
circuit
to
infer
that
had
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
presented
a
genuine
controversy
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
tugboat
that
the
court
would
have
been
obliged
to
take
jurisdiction
and
hear
the
case.
we
submit
that
in
re
new
york
holds,
and
it
is
the
state
of
the
law,
that
a
court
may
initially
examine
a
claim
of
state
involvement
to
determine
whether
a
state's
being
genuinely
sued
in
a
case;
but
that
once
the
state's
presence
is
discovered,
the
suit
must
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
we
would
also
submit
that
the
reasoning,
this
rebuttable
presumption
argument,
simply
begs
the
jurisdictional
question
in
the
most
fundamental
way,
since
all
it
does
is
allow
the
plaintiff
to
reassert
his
position
on
the
merits,
the
eleventh
amendment
notwithstanding.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
i
think
that
is
possible.
i
think
that--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--because
in
this
case--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--the
reason
u.s.
v.
lee
is
not
applicable
is
because
the
order
to
show
cause,
the
trial
court's
final
judgment,
as
well
as
the
fifth
circuit,
was
against
the
state
of
florida.
and
under
alabama
v.
pugh,
this
court
thought
it
important
enough
to
dismiss
the
state
of
alabama
where
an
injunction
was
sought
against
it
even
where
it
was
argued
that
the--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--no.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
right.
what
the
majority
holds
is
that
the
state
must
defend
an
action
to
rescind
a
contract
in
order
to
prevail
on
the
question
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
it's
one
thing
to
determine...
to
inquire
into
your
jurisdiction
and
to
see
whether
the
state's
genuinely
a
party
or
to
determine
whether
there's
even
a
contract
that
exists.
but
once
we
came
into
court
with
a
contract
in
our
hand,
if
you
please,
and
the
possession
of
the
artifacts
already
in
the
state
museum,
i
would
submit
at
that
point
it
was
obvious
that
the
state
was
very
involved
and
very
interested
in
the
litigation,
and
that
the
suit
should
have
been
dismissed
to
a
state
court
which
could
hear
the
issue.
the
majority,
as
i've
stated,
also
used
its
jurisdiction
to
determine
jurisdiction
analysis,
the
question
being
that
if
the
merits
are
so
inextricably
intertwined
with
the...
if
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
so
intimately
tied
to
the
merits,
then
the
majority
can
look
to
the
merits
to
determine
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
here
went
much
further
than
inquiring
into
that
question.
at
least
the
state
of
florida,
as
i've
argued,
did
have
a
colorable
claim
which
was
a
contract
entered
into
on
the
basis
of
its
constitutional
boundaries
and
possession
in
the
state
museum.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
yes,
sir,
i
do.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
state
of
florida
has
never
presumed
to
tell
the
united
states
what
cases
to
intervene
in
and
what
not
to.
and
i
would
also
remind
the
court
that
a
bystander's
interest
in
litigation
does
not
determine
their
rights.
and
secondly
and
most
importantly,
i
would
remind
the
court
that
although
the
facts
in
this
case
may
summon
emotional
feelings
and
what
not,
this
court
does
not
sit
today
to
decide
who
wears
the
white
hat
and
who
wears
a
black
hat.
the
state
courts
are
fully
capable
of
determining
whether
there's
fraud
that
provided
the
impetus
for
a
contract
or
whether--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--that
is
precisely
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
and
i
would
also
say
that
they
made
the
claim
that
we
didn't
controvert
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court.
we
certainly
did,
and
we
happen
to
be
stuck
with
the
record,
if
you
please,
which
every
time
a
host
of
metallurgists
and
chemists
and
illustrators
and
archaeologists
and
historians
literally
reel
in
their
seats
every
time
they
read
it.
and
we
did
controvert
the
allegations
made.
the
findings
were
made
against
us.
but
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
court
can
try
a
suit
to
rescind
a
contract
and
then
decide
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
to
the
case.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
gladly.
florida
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
warrant
for
arrest
in
rem
based
also
on
another
jurisdictional
challenge
which
was
the
fact
that
the
property
did
not
lie
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
southern
district
court.
we
lost
on
that.
the
trial
court
denied
our
motion
to
quash,
and
then
it
ordered
the
state
of
florida
to
show
cause
why
the
property
held
in
its
possession
should
not
be
turned
over
to
the
substitute
custodians,
the
respondents.
the
state
of
florida,
not
l.
ross
morrell,
not
the
secretary
of
state
himself,
not
the
governor,
the
state
of
florida
owned
the
property.
that's
why
the
state
of
florida
had
to
come
in
and
say
we
own
this
property,
we
have
a
contract,
and
the
dispute
should
be
heard
in
federal
court.
we
may
not
have
asserted
the
eleventh
amendment
in
that
first
motion
to
quash.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
your
honor,
it
was
established
in
the
ford
motor
company
case
and
in
the
edelman
case--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--that's
right.
we
did
not
assert
the
eleventh
amendment
until
it
became
clear
that
the
trial
court
was
going
to
try
the
issue
on
the
merits.
our
other
arguments
were
jurisdictional
also,
and
they--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--that
is
correct.
but
we
take
the
position
that
the
edelman
case
as
well
as
the
ford
motor
company
case
recognized
that
a
state
could
come
and
try
the
entire
action,
go
through
an
entire
lawsuit,
go
through
an
appeal,
and
not
even
assert
the
eleventh
amendment
until
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
right,
and
it's
not
waived.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
i'm
sorry.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
it's
a
possibility.
certainly--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--certainly,
your
honor.
we
had
a
contract
in
our
hand--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--we
would
have
to
say
that
we
owned
these
artifacts
pursuant
to
contracts
that
have
already
been
fully
executed
and
that
are
otherwise
valid
on
the
face,
and
under
which
possession
is
already--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--we
believe
that
we
could.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
right.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
we
could
do
that,
if
the
state
was
the
party
or
the
defendant.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
true.
however,
we
did
claim
that
we
had
possession.
we
claimed
both.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
that's
right.
but
the
state
had
possession
of
the
property
under
color
of
title.
the
state
had
entered
into
these
contracts
on
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
boundaries
as
they
had
existed
for
100
years,
and
that--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--no.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
the
state
has
to
demonstrate
a
colorable
title.
however,
we
did
in
this
case
which
would
make
it
even
more--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
yes,
your
honor,
because
ex
parte
young--
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
--certainly.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
the
holding
in
ex
parte
young,
but
i
understand
that
case
to
be
distinguishable
from
this
one
because
that
case
was
brought
against
an
attorney
general
who
was
doing
something
which
was
unconstitutional
in
nature.
and
the
court
held
that
a
suit
can
be
brought
against
a
state
official
when
he
is
committing
acts
which
are
unconstitutional
in
nature,
or
in
other
cases
in
excess
of
his
statutory
authority.
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
state
of
florida
department
of
state
was
the
party.
ms.
susan
gamble
smathers
no,
your
honor.
every
state
has
to
operate
through
its
officials,
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
difference
without
a
difference
if
we
were
to
say
that
ex
parte
young
could
apply
in
any
case
where
the
state
was
the
real
party
in
interest,
and
yet,
obviously
the
state's
interest
has
to
be
conveyed
and
carried
out
by
its
officials.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
in
ex
parte
young
intended
to
draw
that
fine
a
distinction,
and
certainly
in
alabama
v.
pugh
this
court
recognized
even
where
the
relief
requested
could
still
be
achieved
by
not
dismissing
the
state
of
alabama,
the
court
recognized
that
it
was
important
enough
to
dismiss
the
state
of
alabama
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
would
also
dispute
respondent's
representation
that
the
division
of
artifacts
occurred
after
united
states
v.
florida.
the
last
division
of
artifacts
occurred
in
february
1975.
united
states
v.
florida
was
handed
down
in
march
1975,
and
that
is
in
the
record.
we
would
also
argue
with
their
interpretation
of
in
re
muir,
the
navemar,
and
the
republic
of
mexico
cases.
the
eleventh
amendment
was
not
involved
in
those
cases,
and
if
the
eleventh
amendment
is
to
continue
to
have
the
compelling
force
that
this
court
has
held
that
it
does
in
edelman
and
in
its
most
recent
cases,
that
in
re
muir
and
these
cases
should
not
be
held
to
carve
an
exception.
thank
you.
