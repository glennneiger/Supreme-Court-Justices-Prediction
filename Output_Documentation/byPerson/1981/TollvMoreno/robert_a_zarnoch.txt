mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
the
second
time
this
case
has
been
here,
the
second
time
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
examine
the
constitutionality
of
the
university
of
maryland's
policy
of
denying
in-state
benefits
to
non-immigrant
aliens.
the
last
time
this
case
was
here,
it
was
complicated
by
an
unresolved
issue
of
state
law
and
of
concerns
over
the
university's
basis
for
treating
non-immigrant
aliens
differently,
issues
that
have
caused
this
case
to
be
certified,
the
question
to
be
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
and
ultimately
the
case
to
be
remanded
back
down
to
the
district
court.
these
questions
are
now
behind
us.
this
time
around,
however,
the
case
raises
additional
and
perhaps
more
significant
constitutional
questions
evidenced,
i
think,
by
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
in
this
court's
history,
all
50
states
are
participating
here
as
amici
and
unified
behind
a
single
position,
namely,
urging
the
reversal
of
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
and
overruling
of
vlandis
versus
kline.
of
the
four
constitutional
questions
raised
in
this
case,
the
foremost
issue,
we
think,
is
the
question
of
whether
the
university's
policy
denies
equal
protection
to
non-immigrant
aliens.
we
think
that
if
we
prevail
on
this
ground,
many
of
the
other
issues
in
the
case
could
quickly
fall
by
the
wayside.
now,
the
equal
protection
issue
here,
we
think,
calls
into
play
the
very
rationale
for
labeling
certain
alien
classifications
suspect
and
for
according
them
strict
scrutiny,
a
rationale
we
say
that
focuses
in
on
the
burdens
permanent
resident
aliens
share
with
citizens,
and
which
non-immigrant
aliens
as
a
class
conspicuously
lack.
although
resident
aliens
may
be
saddled
with
disabilities,
we
suggest
that
non-immigrant
aliens,
on
the
other
hand,
are
blessed
with
privilege.
at
the
outset,
it
is
important
to
understand
what
is
at
stake
here,
how
many
persons
are
affected
by
the
university's
policy,
and
the
nature
of
the
disadvantaged
class.
first,
all
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
tuition
differential.
at
one
time,
the
university
did
have
a
disparate
charge
with
respect
to
certain
fees,
for
example,
dorm
fees.
that
is
no
longer
the
policy
of
the
university.
only
in
tuition
is
there
a
difference
with
respect
to
in-state
and
out-of-state
students.
secondly,
we
are
not
talking
about
scholarships,
state
scholarships,
that
is.
the
state
of
maryland
does
not
deny
state
scholarships
to
non-immigrant
aliens
as
a
class,
assuming
they
can
show
financial
need.
it
is
also
important
to
note
how
many
people
are
affected
by
the
university's
policy.
according
to
the
record
in
this
case,
during
the
years
1978
and
1979,
there
were
anywhere
from
1,000
to
1,200
permanent
resident
aliens
attending
the
university
of
maryland.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
annually.
and
during
that
period,
approximately
95
percent
of
those
permanent
resident
aliens
qualified
for
the
in-state...
were
classified
in-state
and
received
the
benefit.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
half
as
many
non-immigrant
aliens,
as
few
as
497,
i
believe,
in
1978.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
these
are
non-immigrant
aliens
who
are
classified
as
out-of-state.
in
terms
of
potential
student
population,
the
figures...
the
ratio
is
even
greater.
there
are
seven
times
as
many
permanent
resident
aliens
in
maryland
as
there
are
non-immigrants.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
exactly.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
the
class...
well,
it
is
a
much
smaller...
it
is
a
much
smaller
universe
than
the
class
of
non-immigrants
generally.
the
class
of
non-immigrants
generally
consists
of
diplomats,
foreign
visitors,
foreign
students,
and
employees
of
international
organizations
and
their
families,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--no,
all
of
them
have
a
non-immigrant
visa,
but
not
a
g-4
visa.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
this
case
involves
a
classification
that
disadvantages
all
non-immigrant
aliens.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
all
holders
of
those
particular
visas.
but
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
all
those...
all
those
particular
non-immigrant
categories
are
not
represented
in
the
class
that
the
university...
primarily
they
are
a
visa
holders
and
j
visa
holders
who
are
foreign
students
or
cultural
exchange
students.
there
is
also
the
g-4
aliens,
about
70
g-4
aliens
roughly
in
that
number,
and
diplomats.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
yes,
during
those
years
in
question,
1978
and
1979,
roughly
about
65
to
70.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
the
persons
who
brought
the
challenge
fall
into
that
category.
the
classification
challenge
involves
the
whole
category
of
non-immigrant
aliens,
and
in
fact
both
the
lower
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
it
violated...
the
policy
violated
equal
protection
because
it
disadvantaged
the
entire
class
of
non-immigrant
aliens.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
no,
no.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
your
honor,
they--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--well,
your
honor,
i
think,
you
know,
the
focus
here,
the
policy
itself
disadvantages
a
class,
an
entire
class
of
non-immigrant
aliens.
now,
the
rationale
we
have
offered
in
justification
of
that
policy
focuses
in
to
an
extent
on
tax
contributions
of
that
class.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
no,
your
honor.
no,
it
doesn't.
in
fact,
all
non-immigrant
aliens
are
treated
differently
with
respect
to
taxes
other
than...
treated
differently
than
citizens
and
resident
aliens.
it
so
happens
that
g-4's
can
point
to
a
particular
tax
exemption
that
hurts
their
case,
but,
for
example--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--yes,
it
is
basically
a
matter
of
a
question
of
law.
for
example,
most
non-immigrant
aliens,
for
example,
are
not
taxed
on
foreign
source
income.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is.
in
terms
of
foreign
source
income,
most
non-immigrants
do
not
pay
taxes
on
foreign
source
income.
citizens
and
resident
aliens
do,
on
the
other
hand.
there
are
many
other
categories
of
non-immigrants
that
are
treated
better,
more
advantageously
with
respect
to
taxes.
for
example,
a
foreign
student
from
japan
who
would
attend
the
university
of
maryland
has
a
$2,000
exemption
on
a
portion
of
his
compensation.
there
are
various
treaties
that
confer
a
privileged
tax
status
on
various
non-immigrants.
there
is
even,
for
example,
federal
law
confers
a
tax
break
on
all
international
organization
employees,
not
just
the
particular
banks
who
are
in
this
case.
so,
we
contend
as
a
general
matter
non-immigrant
aliens
are
treated
differently
for
purposes
of
taxation.
they
do
not
pay
their
full
share
of
taxes,
the
class
as
a
whole,
and
g-4's
in
particular.
in
terms
of
the
legal
protection
question
here,
we
say
this
court's
earlier
decisions
in
terms
of
alienage
have
all
focused
in
on
a
number
of
characteristics
when
it
decided
to
accord
strict
scrutiny
to
the
classification
at
issue.
it
looked
at
taxes.
this
court
has
indicated
a
number
of
times
that
resident
aliens
are
taxed
precisely
like
citizens.
they
pay
their
full
share
of
taxes.
non-immigrant
aliens,
as
i
have
tried
to
suggest,
do
not.
there
are
a
number
of
non-immigrant
aliens
who
are
simply
not
here
long
enough
to
contribute
much
in
the
way
of
taxes
or
anything
else
in
terms
of
the
state's
economy.
another--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
there
is
absolutely
no...
federal
law
draws
no
distinction
between
resident
aliens
and
citizens.
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
not
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
in
terms
of
the
other
criteria
this
court
has
looked
at
in
terms
of
strict
scrutiny,
it
is
also
emphasized
that
resident
aliens
serve
in
the
military.
i
think
you
ought
to
note
here
that
non-immigrant
aliens
are
excluded
from...
were
excluded
when
we
had
a
draft,
and
presently
are
not
subject
to
draft
registration,
so
they
are
not
obliged
to
serve
in
the
military.
the
court
has
also
noted
on
occasions
that
resident
aliens
are
required
to
obey
all
of
our
laws.
well,
here,
certain
categories
of
non-immigrants
are
not
completely
obliged
to
obey
all
our
laws.
for
example,
diplomats
are
one
class
that
because
of
either
diplomatic
immunity
or
statutory
immunity
are
not
fully
liable
for
violation
of
certain
laws,
and
the
same
is
true
of
employees
of
international
organizations,
who
by
statute
have
a
certain
immunity
that
relieves
them
from
the
obligations
of
complying
with
all
the
country's
laws.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that
is
by
federal
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
at
your
urging,
i
will
move
on
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
sure.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
i
think
so
far
our
court
of
appeals
has
only
held
that
g-4
aliens
are
capable
of
acquiring--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
we
exclude
non...
so
we
exclude
citizens--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--your
honor,
the
policy
excludes
them
anyway.
the
policy
doesn't
look
into
the
particular
domicile
of
any
non-immigrant.
the
policy
simply
excludes
them
as
a
class.
you
know,
whether
or
not
they
are
capable
of
acquiring
domicile
or
not,
because
of
the
cost
equalization
rationale
that
we--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--your
honor,
the
policy
never
was
amended,
in
terms
of
the
operation
and
effect.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
there
was
a
resolution
issued
in
june
of
1978
that--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--your
honor,
this
case
was
argued,
it
was
argued
to
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
that,
in
1976,
that
is,
on
the
grounds
that
g-4
aliens
could
not
acquire
a
domicile--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--and
therefore
couldn't
meet
the
test
anyway.
we
have
also
argued
consistently
since
then
certainly
that
the
policy
is
independently
supported
by
a
rational
basis
of
cost
equalization.
in
fact,
the
students
when
they
were
informed
by
the
university
president
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
accorded
state
status,
were
given
two
reasons,
first,
the
cost
equalization
tax
notion,
and
secondly
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
acquire
domicile.
now,
that
issue
is
no
longer
a
question.
the
court
has...
our
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
g-4
aliens
can
be
domiciled.
the
rationale
on
that
decision
doesn't
say
what
other
categories
of
non-immigrant
aliens
could
or
might
or
may
not
be
domiciled
in
the
state
of
maryland,
and
we
don't--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--could
be
domiciled.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
i
think
you
could.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that's
true.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
policy--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--yes.
well,
your
honor,
that's
true.
well,
it's
not
just
state
income
tax.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
it
is
just
that
that
class,
viewed...
viewing
the
general
characteristics
of
that
class,
they
don't
particularly
contribute
fully
to
the
support
of
the
university
of
maryland,
which,
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--that
is
the
chief
concern,
because
the
university--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
many
of
the
taxes
cited
by
the
g-4's
as
paying,
they
don't
particularly
fund
the
costs
of
the
education
at
the
university
of
maryland.
for
example,
property
taxes
don't
pay
for...
motor
vehicle
taxes,
none
of
those
things
pay
for
the
university
education.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
no,
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
at
least
three
possible
ways
the
court
would
not
have
to
overrule
vlandis
versus
kline
to
uphold
the
policy.
one
would
be
simply
to...
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
policy
does
not
violate
equal
protection,
and
finds
a
rational
basis...
finds
our
basis
for
the
policy
rational,
that
is
enough
to
survive
a
due
process
challenge.
for
example,
in
vlandis
versus
kline,
this
court
noted
that
aside
from
an
interest
in
administrative
certainty,
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
connecticut's
treatment
of
non-residents.
if,
for
example,
if
the
court
does
find
a
rational
basis
here,
it
is
not
invalid,
even
for
vlandis
as
it
existed.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
your
honor,
as
i
am
saying,
if
it
decides,
you
know,
as
i
say,
and
the
court
can
address
the
due
process
question
and
simply
say
that
we
have
a
rational
basis
under
the
policy.
that
is
enough
to
meet
vlandis
as
modified
by
salfi
or
whatever
else.
i
think--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--well,
your
honor,
i...
well--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--that's
true.
it
said--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--it
said
it
was
invalid
from
the
period
1976
through
1978.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
your
honor,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reach
the
due
process
question.
the
question
asked
by
justice
o'connor
was
whether
you
have
to
overrule
vlandis
versus
kline
to
do
that.
we
certainly
are
asking
the
court
to
address
that
due
process
question.
one
way
that
we
say
to
do
it
is,
if
you
find
a
rational
basis
for
the
policy
under
equal
protection,
it
is
obviously
rational
under
due
process.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
your
honor,
it
would
be...
the
policy
has
not
changed
in
effect
with
respect
to
non-immigrant
aliens.
i
mean,
non-immigrant
aliens
were
denied
before
1978
and
after
1978.
if
the
policy
was
rational
now,
and
in
terms
of
its
operation
and
effect,
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
rational
since
1976?
why
wouldn't
the
due
process
conclusion
of
the
court,
even
for
that
particular
period,
fall
by
the
wayside?
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
i
say
you
have
to
address
the
issue.
you
just
don't
have
to
overrule
vlandis
versus
kline
to
do
it.
i
think
if
you
find
a
rational
basis,
you
know,
you
have
sustained
the
policy.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
we
have
also
argued
a
number
of
grounds
for
getting
around
vlandis
versus
kline,
but
we
do
ask
the
court,
and
we...
as
all
50
states
do,
to
overrule
vlandis
versus
kline,
because
we
do
think
the
case
is
really
a
dead
letter
in
the
law.
to
turn
to
the
supremacy
clause
for
a
moment,
there
are
really
two
separate
supremacy
clause
arguments.
one
was
basically
premised
upon
an
impermissible
state
attempt
to
regulate
immigration,
and
the
lower
court
held
the
policy
invalid
on
that
ground
solely
because
it
found
an
invidious
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
no
other
basis
was
given.
so,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
we...
if
that
theory
prevails,
we
should
be...
if
the
court
finds
it
okay
under
equal
protection,
it
should
find
the
policy
okay
under
the
supremacy
clause,
under
that
aspect
of
the
supremacy
clause.
there
is
a
second
supremacy
clause
argument
made
here,
and
that
was
made
as
an
alternate
ground,
and
this
was
the
one
that
was
rejected
by
the
lower
court.
that
argument
is
made
that
the
university...
the
rationale
of
the
university's
in-state
policy,
that
rationale
somehow
conflicts
with
the
rationale
of
the
international
agreements
conferring
a
tax
advantage
on
the
bank
employees.
now,
the
lower
court
rejected
this
purported
class
of
rationales
as
too
attenuated
to
amount
to
a
supremacy
clause
violation,
and
we
suggest
that
at
least
in
this
respect
the
lower
court
was
right,
that
what
the
university's
policy
does
is
simply
include
g-4
aliens
in
a
group
of
non-immigrant
aliens
who,
for
a
particular
reason,
and
it
is
not
just,
you
know,
this
particular
treaty
tax
exemption
or
a
tax
exemption
flowing
from
an
international
agreement,
for
a
variety
of
reasons
do
not
contribute
the
way
citizens
and
permanent
resident
aliens
do
to
the
cost
of
university
education.
we
don't
pick
out
an
international
agreement
or
a
treaty.
in
fact,
in
some
cases
we
don't
even
focus...
you
know,
we
don't
focus
in
on
the
individual
tax
situation
of
anybody.
we
simply
drew
a
line,
and
the
g-4
aliens
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
line
for
purposes
of
acquiring
the
in-state
tuition.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
sure.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
your
honor,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
cost
equalization
rationale,
it
is
particularly
appropriate
when
you
are
talking
about
a
university
education
that
is
funded
by
primarily
tax,
income
tax
remedies.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
but...
well,
most
of
them
are...
for
example,
police
protection
is
funded
by
local
property
tax.
the
garbage
collection
would
be,
too.
there
really
is
no
disability,
as
i
understand
it,
from
any
of
the...
any
non-immigrants
from
contributing
their
full
share
of
property
taxes.
so,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
rationale,
our
rational
basis
that
we
are
asserting
here
may
not
hold
water
if
you
are
trying
to
justify
that
kind
of
restriction.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
yes.
for
example...
yes.
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
your
honor,
it
is
basically
from
three
sources.
in
terms
of
state
dollars
being
pumped
in,
it
is
largely
income
tax.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
no.
local
property
taxes
pay
for
primary
and
secondary
education.
state
property
taxes
pay
state
bond
issues.
so
property
taxes
really
aren't
at
issue.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
yes,
we
certainly
do
use
federal
funds,
but
the
primary
source
of
the
revenues
of
the
state
are
still
the
income
tax
and
the
general
funds
in
the
treasury.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
your
honor,
in
terms
of
being
treated
differently
for
income
tax
purposes,
yes,
the
federal
government
treats
most
non-immigrants
differently
with
respect
to
payment
of
foreign
source
income
for...
payment
of
tax
on
foreign
source
income.
the
federal
government
doesn't
tax
them
on
that,
and
the
state
of
maryland
doesn't...
the
state
of
maryland
doesn't
either.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
there
may
be
a
few,
and
i
am
going
to
say
it
is
not
perfect,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
perfect.
there
may
be
a
few
classes
of
non-immigrants
who,
for
example,
are...
don't
have
a
tax
exemption
and
may
be
classified
as
a
resident
alien
for
purposes
of
the
federal
income
tax,
which
means
they
are
treated
the
same.
a
few
might
be
in
that
category,
but
we
suggest,
judging
the
class
by
its
general
characteristics,
only
a
few.
the
majority
of
people
don't.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
to
the
cost--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--to
the
costs
of
the
education.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
your
honor,
as
i
indicated
before,
that,
you
know,
there
are
a
few
that,
for
example,
don't
have
a
tax
break.
they
simply
may
be
classified
as
a
resident
alien
for
income
tax
purposes,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--but
they
are
still
disqualified,
because
they
are
included
in
the
broad
class
of
non-immigrant
aliens.
we
don't
evaluate
the
individual
tax
situation
of
non-immigrant
aliens.
what
we
do
is,
we
are
including
every
member
of
that
class.
you
know,
they
are
disadvantaged
by
the
policy,
without
a
focus
in
on
the
particular
source
of
their
tax
break,
be
it
state
law,
be
it
federal
law,
be
it
treaty,
no
matter
where.
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
general
characteristics
of
non-immigrant
aliens,
and
we
suggest
that
having
drawn
the
line
there,
we
are
not
picking
out,
for
example,
a
federal
treaty
problem
or
a
federal
tax
benefit.
for
example,
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
law
that
requires
the
state
of
maryland
to
exempt
foreign
source
income
from...
the
payment
of
taxes
on
foreign
source
income.
that
federal
law
does
not
require
a
tax
on
that,
but
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
particular
requirement
that
the
states
not
tax
that
kind
of
income.
but
in
any
event,
the
state
doesn't
tax
it,
and
that
is
another
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
large
number
of
members
of
the
class.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well,
i
could
give
you
some
rough
figures
in
terms
of
percentages.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
but
in
terms
of
the
general
funds
of
the...
roughly
the
university
got
about
$160
million
in
a
recent
year.
in
terms
of...
roughly
$30
million
comes
in
by
way
of
tuition
and
fees,
and
that
money
is
appropriated
back
to
the
university
by
our
general
assembly
each
year.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
no,
i
don't...
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
have
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
as
i
said,
in
terms
of
tuition--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
absolutely
not.
in
terms
of
the
tuition
receipts
by
the
university
of
maryland,
roughly
$30
million.
in
terms
of
general
funds
being
pumped
back
into
the
university,
$160
million,
five
times
as
much.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
it
is
clearly
a
subsidy,
you
know.
it
is
tax
subsidized.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
it
is...
it
has
gone
up
since
the
time
of
the
figures
stated
in
the
court's
opinion.
it
is
now
$900
a
semester,
is
the
differential.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
the
two
figures,
i
believe,
are
roughly...
well,
in
terms
of
yearly
figures,
$700
for
resident
and
$2,500
for
non-resident.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
$1,800
a
year.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
the
income
tax
rate
is...
it
is
5
percent,
roughly
5
percent
over--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--well,
your
honor,
i
think,
you
know,
focusing
in
on
non-immigrant
aliens,
and
particularly
the
g-4's,
for
instance,
you
know,
all
the
parents
of
the
plaintiffs,
for
instance,
here
are
professional
employees
of
world
bank,
making
salaries
well
in
excess
of
$20,000.
even
the
record
indicated
the
salaries
were
in
the
$30,000
and
$40,000
range,
even
when
this
case
was
argued
back
in
1976.
so,
you
know,
g-4's
are
a
particularly
appropriate
class
to
contend
that,
you
know,
they
are
being
disadvantaged
with
respect
to
an
income
tax
contribution
rationale,
but,
you
know,
the
rationale
goes
a
little
further
than
simply
contributions
during
the
period
in
question.
for
example,
if
you
stay
in
the
state
for
a
period
of
time,
for
example,
an
alien
with
a
tax
exemption,
or
a
non-immigrant
alien
with
a
tax
exemption,
you
are
likely
to
stay
here
for
a
number
of
years,
you
know,
just
beyond
the
four
years
that
a
student
might
be
in
college.
for
example,
the
g-4
aliens
here,
many
of
them
stick
around
until
retirement
age,
having
escaped
income
tax
on
their
salaries
for
maybe
15,
20
years.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
yes,
the
university
does
derive
income
or
funds
from
the
sales...
the
state
sales
tax,
but
in
terms
of--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--well,
the...
in
terms
of
total,
total
revenues,
the
total
revenue
picture,
about
a
quarter
comes
from
income
tax,
half
as
much
comes
from
the
sales
tax.
there
is
twice...
there
is
twice
as
many
income
tax...
as
much
income
tax
revenue
as
there
are
sales
tax
revenues.
the
sales
tax
in
fact
is
not
even
the
second
biggest
item.
federal
funds
are
the
second
item
in
terms
of
the
top
draw
on
the
budget.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
vlandis
versus
kline
question,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
on
the
other
issues.
we
have
set
forth
a
number
of
reasons
why
we
think
vlandis
should
be
overruled,
and
the
foremost
of
which
is
whether
the
vlandis
versus
kline
doctrine
represents
a
separate
analysis
any
more.
typically,
when
a
suit
is
brought
challenging
a
state
policy
under
the
irrebuttable
presumption
doctrine,
it
also
is
challenged
under
an
equal
protection
theory,
and
invariably
lower
courts,
taking
its
key,
i
think,
from
both
salfi
and
your
honors'
opinion
in
usery
versus
turner
elkhorn
mining
company,
have
concluded
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
state
enactment
is
premised
in
the
form
of
a
presumption,
as
long
as
its
operation
and
effect
are
permissible.
for
example,
if
under
equal
protection
there
is
a
rational
basis
that
supports
it,
we
need
look
no
further
under
due
process,
and
the
lower
courts,
the
circuit
courts
have
simply...
they
treat
an
equal
protection
issue
first,
and
then
automatically
it
is
okay
under
due
process.
so,
the
question
is
really,
is
there
a
separate
analysis
there
any
more.
also,
there
is
a
real
question
as
to
whether
a
court
should
be
inquiring,
demanding
more
than
a
rational
basis
on...
as
apparently
was
the
case
in
vlandis
versus
kline.
there
is
also
a
debate
among
the
courts
as
to
where
the
irrebuttable
presumption
doctrine
belongs.
is
it
equal
protection?
is
it
substantive
due
process?
is
it
procedural
due
process?
and
frankly,
is
not
in
sync
with
any
of
those
particular
theories.
and
lastly,
i
think
in
terms
of
the...
it
really
doesn't
demand
the
rationality
of
a
measure
any
more.
the
way
the
doctrine
is
presently
formulated,
all
you
really
need
is
to
articulate
some
particular
basis,
an
additional
basis,
more
than
one
basis
for
your
particular
policy,
and
order
them
in
a
sufficient
fashion,
whether
that
is
primary
or
secondary.
it
doesn't
demand,
at
least
in
the
way
it
is
presently
formulated,
that
a
policy
be
rational,
and
we
suggest
that
is
what
the
court
should
be
looking
for,
and
that
is
really
the
only
inquiry
a
court
should
engage
in
when
the
issue
is
whether
a
due
process
violation
has
occurred.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
your
honor,
i
will
just
be
very,
very
brief.
first--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--four
minutes,
your
honor?
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
assertion
that
most
spouses
of
g-4
aliens
pay
some
tax,
the
record...
the
only
record
references
to
the
actual
payment
of
tax
would
show
that
two
out
of
the
three
parents
of
the
named
plaintiffs
do
not
have
spouses
earning
income
tax.
the
record
would
rebut
that
contention.
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
class
affected,
the
question
here
that
we
are
only
dealing
with
a
small
number
of
non-immigrant
aliens,
first,
diplomats,
a
visa
holders,
aren't
any
different
than
g
visa
holders.
there
are
72
of
them
at
the
university
of
maryland
during
the
period
in
question.
so
you
would
add
another
72
on.
there
are
additional
classes
that
really
aren't
terribly
different
than
g-4's
in
terms
of
not
having
a
federal
disability.
moreover,
the
question
of
whether
any
of
the
categories
of
non-immigrant
aliens
can
be
domiciled
in
maryland
is
a
question
for
the
maryland
courts
to
decide,
as
this
court
indicated
itself
in
elkins
versus
moreno
the
first
time
this
case
was
here.
the
courts
across
the
country
differ
widely
on
visa
categories,
whether
they
are
able
to
acquire
domicile
in
a
jurisdiction
for
a
particular
purpose.
there
is
absolutely
no
consistency,
no
guarantee
that
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
find
every
category
of
non-immigrant
capable
of
being
domiciled
in
the
state
of
maryland.
moreover,
the
class
struck
down
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
by
the
lower
court
included
all
non-immigrant
aliens.
if
you
judge
the
class--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--your
honor,
if
all
maryland
does
is--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--may
not
deny
them
domicile?
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
well--
mr.
robert
a.
zarnoch
--but
in
terms
of
their...
their
position
is
they
can't
be
denied
the
benefit,
rather
than
domicile.
but
even
if
you
assume
all
categories
of
non-immigrant
aliens
can
be
domiciled
here,
you
know,
we
suggest
that
the
cost
equalization
rationale
cuts
across
that
line.
we
don't
pick
out
g-4
aliens,
their
treaty
benefits.
we
focus
on
simply
the
status
of
being
non-immigrant,
and
we
think
that
is
justifiable.
thank
you,
your
honor.
