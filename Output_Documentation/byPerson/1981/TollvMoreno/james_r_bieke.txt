mr.
james
r.
bieke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
university's
policy
establishes
a
classification
based
on
alienage,
for
on
its
face
it
allows
citizens
and
immigrant
aliens
who
are
domiciled
in
maryland
to
obtain
but
it
totally
excludes
all
non-immigrant
aliens
from
doing
so
even
if
they
are
likewise
domiciled
in
maryland,
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
this
policy,
this
classification
treats
unequally
only
the
non-immigrants
who
can
be
and
are
domiciled
in
maryland.
contrary
to
what
the
assistant
attorney
general
said,
this
is
not
at
all
non-immigrants.
this
court's
opinion
in
the
alkins
case
held
specifically
that
most
non-immigrants,
and
it
listed
a
number
of
the
visa
categories,
were
precluded
by
the
terms
of
their
visas
under
the
federal
law
from
establishing
domicile
in
this
country.
obviously,
these
people
are
not
discriminated
against
by
the
university's
policy,
because
even
if
they
were
treated
like
citizens
and
immigrants,
they
would
fail
to
qualify.
the
only
non-immigrants
treated
unequally
by
the
policy
are
those
such
as
g-4's
and
a
few
other
categories
who
are
capable
of
being
domiciled
in
maryland
under
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
no,
the
class
certified,
your
honor,
consisted
only
of
g-4's.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact...
but
i
was
trying
to
make
a
different
point.
that's
true.
the
only
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
g-4's.
that's
the
class
we
represent,
the
only
class
certified
by
the
district
court.
and
the--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
would
be...
it
is
made
clear
by
the
fact
that
most
non-immigrants
aren't
hurt
by
the
policy.
all
we
are--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--that's
true.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
your
honor--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--on
its
face,
it
applies
to
all
non-immigrants,
but
all
non-immigrants
are
not
treated
unequally
by
the
policy.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
right.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
that
is
true.
the--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
now,
this--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--mr.
zarnoch
correctly
said
that
in
the
years
around
1978,
1979,
there
were
around
70
g-4's
at
the
university.
the
only
other
non-immigrant
categories
that
we
believe
are
capable
of
establishing
domicile
in
this
country
are
e's,
who
are
treaty
traders,
and
i's,
who
are
foreign
media
representatives.
there
is
no
indication
that...
we
don't
know
how
many
of
those
were
at
the
university,
but
not
very
many.
most
of
them
were...
are
people
who
are
students
who
come
to
this
country
solely
to
go
to
school,
and
this
court
in
elkins
made
clear
that
those
people
cannot
be
domiciled
in
this
country.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
per
year.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
that
is
not
the
case,
your
honor.
we
of
course
represent
g-4,
all
g-4
visa
holders,
and
these
are
employees
of
different
kinds
of
organizations,
so
it
is
a
different
question
for
different
organizations.
for
the
interamerican
development
bank,
their
policy
is
to
reimburse
their
employees
one-half
the
tuition
and
fees
up
to
$3,500,
so
obviously
if
they
pay
a
higher
rate
they
pay
half
of
the
higher
rate.
and
for
the
world
bank,
they
do
have
a
reimbursement
policy
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
that
policy
was
adopted
after
the
district
court
issued
its
initial
decision
and
stay,
and
for
the
purpose
of...
the
period
of
the
stay,
for
the
purpose
of
this
litigation.
at
the
time
the
class
was
certified,
the
g-4
people
themselves
had
paid
the
difference,
and
so
at
the
time
the
class
was
certified,
they
represented
the
class,
and
they
had
been
harmed.
and
there
are
a
number
of
organizations,
and
we
don't
know...
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
have
any
policy
of
reimbursement,
the
other...
the
people
for
the
other
organizations.
now,
the
university's
policy
here,
as
i
said,
treats
the
non-immigrants
who
are
domiciled
in
maryland
differently
from
citizens
and
immigrants
domiciled,
because
they
are
the
only
ones,
the
non-immigrants
are
the
only
ones
who
are
excluded
from
in-state
status
without
reference
to
their
domicile.
this
is
a
classification
that
is
based
on
their
alienage,
or
more
specifically,
on
their
immigration
or
visa
status,
which
is
something
that
has
been
set
by
congress.
in
fact,
the
university's
main
justification
for
this
discriminatory
treatment,
which
is
that
they
are
exempt
from
taxes
on
their
salaries,
is
also
something
based
on
a
federally
granted
right.
in
our
view,
this
discriminatory
treatment
violates
both
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause.
for
equal
protection
purposes,
the
classification
made
by
the
universities
under
the
nyquist
case,
one
based
on
alienage
because
it
is
directed
at
aliens
and
harms
only
aliens,
and
we
believe
that
this
classification
should
be
subject
to
the
same
strict
scrutiny
that
the
court
has
applied
to
other
classifications
based
on
alienage.
the
reason
why
strict
scrutiny
has
been
established
as
a
protective
measure
is
that
aliens
are
a
prime
example
of
a
discreet
and
insular
minority
who
have
no
voice
in
the
political
process
and
may
be
discriminated
against
by
the
majority
unless
specially
protected
by
the
courts.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
they
are.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
medicare,
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
precludes...
that
draws
a
distinction
that
excludes
not
only
non-immigrants
but
some
permanent
resident
aliens,
some
immigrants,
and
that
was
upheld
in
mathews
versus
diaz
on
the
specific
ground
that
the
federal
government
has
power
to
distinguish
among
aliens
that
the
states
don't
have.
but
the
non-immigrants
here,
that
is,
the
rationale
of
strict
scrutiny
that
i
said
applies
equally
to
non-immigrants
living
in
this
country,
residing
this
country,
as
it
does
to
immigrants.
the
university
would
have
you
apply
to
this
classification,
which
is
concededly
based
on
alienage
and
singles
out
a
class
of
aliens
for
discriminatory
treatment
the
same
lenient
rational
basis
standard
that
has
been
applied
in
the
economic
area
to
classifications
which
don't
discriminate
against
any
particular
class
that
has
been
the
object
of
heightened
judicial
solicitude,
but
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
court's
whole
history
of
concern
for
aliens,
and
also,
i
should
say...
i
will
get
to
this
later...
with
the
principles
under
the
supremacy
clause.
now,
mr.
zarnoch
makes
a
point
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
sometimes
in
prior
opinions
referred
to
certain
attributes
of
immigrant
aliens.
generally
speaking,
however,
those
references
were
made
in
the
context
of
applying
strict
scrutiny,
not
in
determining
whether
strict
scrutiny
should
be
applied,
but
in
any
case.
but
in
any
case,
the
non-immigrants
who
are
disadvantaged,
the
non-immigrants
who
are
treated
unequally
by
this
policy,
as
i
said,
are
those
who
are
domiciled
in
the
state,
and
these
are
not
very
different
from
immigrant
aliens.
they
live
in
the
state
for
many
years.
they
must
obey
all
their
laws,
all
the
state's
laws,
and
i
might
say,
incidentally,
they
do
not
have
diplomatic
immunity,
as
mr.
zarnoch
implied.
they
are
assimilated
into
their
communities.
they
participate
in
their
communities,
and
they
pay
all
taxes
except
those
on
which
they
have
a
specific
exemption
established
by
international
agreement,
over
which
they
have
no
control,
and
these
taxes
include
not
only
sales
taxes
and
property
taxes,
but
income
taxes
on
all
other
income
except
those
salaries.
if
their
spouses
work,
full
income
taxes
on
their
spouses'
salaries.
if
they
get
any
other
income
from
investments
and
so
on,
they
pay
full
income
taxes
on
that.
these
people
have
made
the
state
their
home.
that
is
the
meaning
of
domicile.
they
are
not
going
to
return
to
some
foreign
country
some
time.
they
live
here,
and
they
intend
to
live
here
permanently.
and
at
least
when
the
state
is
treating
such
a
class
of
its
own
domiciliaries
differently
from
its
other
domiciliaries,
solely
on
the
ground
that
they
are
a
particular
kind
of
alien,
that
classification
should
be
subject
to
the
same
scrutiny
that
this
court
has
applied
to
classifications
harming
immigrant
aliens.
now,
the
university
makes
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
these
people
don't
pay
the
full
range
of
taxes,
but
as
i
said,
that
is
not
a
reason
for
lowering--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--sorry.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
no,
your
honor.
the...
even
if
the
court
would
decide
that
strict
scrutiny
did
not
apply,
nevertheless
there
is
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
this
is
a
classification
which
singles
out
aliens
for
discriminatory
treatment,
and
shouldn't
be
subject
to
the
same
rational
basis
test
that
has
been
applied
to,
say,
social
security
classifications.
at
least
some
form
of
heightened
scrutiny
should
be
required,
and
we
don't
think
that
could
be
met.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
well,
there
is
one
other
thing
i
have
to
say.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
no.
we
can
rely
on
the
supremacy
clause.
even
if
the
court
should
decide--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--it
is
a
whole
different
thing.
yes.
but
it
requires
that
there...
when
there
is
a
classification,
a
discrimination
against
aliens
who
are
lawfully
admitted
to
this
country
when
the
state
is
imposing
discriminatory
burdens
on
them,
the
supremacy
clause,
too,
requires
something
more
than
rational
basis,
but...
and
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
even
apart
from
all
of
that,
even
apart
from
any
strict
scrutiny
or
any
heightened
scrutiny,
and
apart
from
the
supremacy
clause,
the
classification
is
not
rational.
now,
that
is
a
hard
argument,
and
we
don't
think
we
would
have
to
reach
it,
because
of
all
the
reasons
i
gave
for
why
the
scrutiny
should
be
stronger.
but
still,
it
is
not
rational.
in
fact,
these
people
do
pay
all
taxes
except
those
on
which
they
have
the
exemption.
they
pay
sales
taxes,
property
taxes,
and
income
taxes
on
any
other
income,
and
over
the
course
of
the
years,
then,
they
may
have
made
substantial
contributions
to
that
state.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
if
the
federal
government's
policy
was,
they
didn't
have
to
pay
any
taxes?
mr.
james
r.
bieke
well,
that
would
be
harder
for
a
rational
basis.
it
would
be
better
for
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
that
would
be
a...
it
is
not
our
case.
it
would
be
a
harder
question.
but
there
is
still
the
fact
that
the
university
does
not
apply
this
cost
equalization
tax
payment
justification
to
citizens
and
immigrants.
there
is
still
that
aspect
of
irrationality,
and
there
are
a
number--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--not
all
of
them.
there
can
be...
there
are
a
number
of
sources
of
state
income
that
go
to
citizens
or
immigrants
on
which...
which
are
exempt
from
state
taxes.
for
example,
immigrant
visa
holders
working
for
these
same
international
organizations,
and
there
are
hundreds
of
them,
are
likewise
exempt
from
taxes
on
their
salaries,
and
yet
they
are
entitled
to
in-state
status
upon
a
showing
of
domicile.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
by
virtue
of
the
international
agreements
establishing
the
organizations
for
which
they
work.
that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
indeed.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
are
both
entirely
sufficient
to
win.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
there
are
some
different
consequences.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
i
think
that
i
can
only
say
that
i--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--they
both
have
exactly
the
same
results.
our
clients
who
are...
as
i
say,
all
we
are
seeking
here
is
equal
treatment
with
citizens
and
immigrants.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
if
congress
said
that,
then
we
would...
the
supremacy
clause
ground
would
be
gone,
of
course.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
congress
could
not
say
that,
but
congress
could
say
that
they
could
no
longer...
they
could
reach
the
same
result
by
saying
that
they
could
change
the
domicile
point
and
say
that
we
are
now
going
to
treat
them
just
like
most
non-immigrants,
say
they
can't
be
domiciled.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
they
could,
in
the
way
i
said.
the
supremacy
clause
only
requires
that
people
be
equally
treated.
most
non-immigrants
are
not
being
treated
unequally
by
this
because
they
can't
be
domiciled
here
under
federal
law.
congress
could
say
that
these
non-immigrants--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--could
not
be
domiciled
here
under
federal
law
either.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
they
haven't
done
that,
and
they
haven't
done
anything
like
what
you
suggest
for
supremacy
clause.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
i
think
that
both--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--yes,
there
are.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
this
judgment
is
going
to
control
only
those
non-immigrants
who
are
capable--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--of
being
domiciled
in
this
country--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--and
there
aren't
very
many
of
them.
there...
most
of
the
g-4's
live
in...
around
washington
and
new
york,
because
that
is
where
the
international
organizations
are.
there
aren't
a
lot
of
people
throughout
the
country
and
the
states.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
now,
let
me--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
live
mostly
around
new
york.
now,
let
me
address
the
supremacy
clause
issue.
under
this
court's
decisions
in
the
cases
of
takahashi,
graham
against
richardson,
decanas
against
bica,
it
is
established
that
it
is
up
to
the
federal
government
to
decide
the
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
aliens
will
be
admitted
to
this
country
and
will
reside
in
this
country,
and
once
it
has
done
so,
the
states
may
not
impose
additional
discriminatory
burdens
on
them...
excuse
me...
not
contemplated
by
congress,
and
they
especially
may
not
do
so
on
account
of
their
immigration
status
assigned
by
congress.
here,
congress
has
assigned
the
various
classes
of
immigrants
and
non-immigrants,
and
has
decided
on
the
restrictions
applicable
to
them,
and
as
this
court
held
in
flkins,
congress
has
deliberately
decided
that
the
g-4
visa
holders
and
a
few
other
categories
are
entitled
to
be
domiciled
in
this
country,
unlike
most
non-immigrants.
in
this
situation,
the
states
may
not
rely
on
their
immigration
status
to
impose
45
restrictions
not
imposed
on
other
domiciliaries
of
the
state.
to
do
that
is
to
impose
on
their
residents
in
this
country
discriminatory
burdens
not
contemplated
by
congress.
this
may
be
justified,
but
only
in
the
most
exceptional
circumstances,
such
as,
for
example,
where
the
state
is
regulating
in
the
area
of
traditional
state
sovereignty,
defining
qualifications
for
voting
or
for
holding
elective
offices.
there
that...
there
may
be
a
good
reason
for
what
the
state
has
done,
but
nothing
like
that
is
involved
here.
here,
congress
has
decided
that
these
non-immigrants
can
be
domiciled
here,
as
a
matter
of
federal
immigration
law.
and
but
for
their
status
under
the
federal
immigration
law,
they
would
be
entitled
to
these
benefits.
in
this
situation,
the
state
cannot
on
account
of
their
immigration
status
deny
them
the
benefits
that
it
grants
to
all
other
domiciliaries.
that
is
inconsistent
with
congress's
decision
in
admitting
them.
that
is
an
encroachment
on
the
exclusive
federal
authority
over
immigration,
and
is
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
certainly
there
are
situations
in
which
the
state
may
rely
on
the
federal
decision.
for
example,
here,
the
federal
decision
is
that
most
categories
of
non-immigrants
can't
be
domiciled
in
this
country,
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
states
relying
on
that
to
exclude
them
from
in-state
status,
assuming
that
citizens
and
immigrants
were
treated
on
the
basis
of
domicile,
but
here,
the
only
difference
between
these
non-immigrants
and
immigrants
is
their
immigration
status,
and--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--your
honor,
that
is
true,
but
that
is
also
based
on
a
federally
granted
right.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
that...
well,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
saying
that
completely.
that
is,
it
is
not
applying
that
cost
equalization
justification
to
immigrants
and
citizens.
as
i
said,
some
immigrants
and
citizens
are
47
exempt
from
taxes,
and
yet
the
university
is
allowing
them
to
obtain
in-state
status
upon
a
showing
of
domicile.
the
real
crucial
difference
between
these
people,
non-immigrants
domiciled
in
the
state
and
immigrants
domiciled
in
the
state,
and
citizens,
is
their
immigration,
their
visa
status,
and
that,
the
university
cannot
rely
on
because
it
is
imposing
additional
discriminatory
burdens
not
contemplated
by
congress.
but
even
if
the
university
says
no,
that
is
not
why
we
are
treating
them
differently,
we
are
treating
them
differently
because
they
don't
pay
taxes,
that
is
no
good
either.
that
is
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
as
well,
because
for
most
g-4's,
those
employed
by
the
organizations
listed
in
our
addendum
a
to
our
brief,
they
have
been
granted
by
the
international
agreements
which
have
established
them--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--most
of
them
could
if
they...
because
most
of
them
pay
income
tax,
on
other
than
their
salary.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
well,
i
don't
know.
that
would
be
an
interesting
question.
the
principle...
but
the
principle
is...
i
would
have
to
think
about
that
for
a
minute.
let
me...
the
principle
is
that
the
state,
even...
there
need
not
be
a
direct
conflict
between
the
language
of
the
policy
and
the
language
of
the
international
agreements.
it
is
established
that
the
state
may
not
penalize
them
on
account
of
something
granted
by...
an
exemption
granted
by
federal
law,
and
i
think
they
might
have
an
argument
in
that
case.
certainly
they
have
an
argument
here
that
the
objective
of
the
international
agreements
is
that
these
people
are
supposed
to
have
an
income
tax
exemption,
and
that
carries
with
it
the
implication
that
they
are
not
to
be
penalized
by
the
state,
not
to
be
subjected
to
burdens
by
the
state
on
account
of
their
federally
granted
income
tax
exemption.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
in
many
cases,
starting
with--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--the
graham
against
richardson
relied
on
both
grounds.
the
takahashi
case
also
both
grounds.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
well,
they
were...
certainly
appeared
to
be
independent
grounds,
and
the
decanas
case,
decanas
against
bica,
was
a
case
that
upheld
a
classification
that
harmed
illegal
aliens,
but
that
case
made
clear
the
principles,
and
that
was
only
a
supremacy
clause
case,
and
said
specifically
that
it
is
up
to
congress
to
decide
the
conditions
on
which
aliens
will
be
admitted
to
this
country,
and
that
states
may
not
impose
additional
discriminatory
burdens
not
contemplated
by
congress,
and
we
believe
that
principle
applies
here.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
no,
the
cases
in
fact
that
this
court
has
decided
to
date
have
all
applied
strict
scrutiny,
but
none
have
involved
only
non-immigrants.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
they
have
involved
either
all
aliens
or
permanent
resident
aliens.
but
as
i
said,
these
people
are
not
very
different
from
permanent
resident
aliens.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
it
would
depend
on--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--that
would
be
okay,
if
they
treated
citizens
and
immigrants
the
same
as
non-immigrants.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
citizens
of
the
united
states
resident
in
virginia
pay
$50,
and
so
do
immigrants.
non-immigrants
resident
of
virginia,
even
if
domiciled
there,
pay
$100.
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
strong
argument
in
that
case
that
they
would
not
be
treating
them
equally.
it
would
depend
on
the
justification
in
that
case.
if
it
was
that
they
didn't
pay
taxes,
we
would
have
a
problem.
now,
there
is
a
case--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--i
think
that
would
be
penalizing
them
on
account
of
something
granted
by
the
federal
government.
now,
there
is
a
good
case
not
cited
in
our
brief
on
this
point,
a
case
called
perez
against
campbell.
it
is
in
402
of
the
united
states
reports.
that
case
involved
the
federal
bankruptcy
act,
which
allowed
people
to
obtain
full
discharges
in
bankruptcy,
and
the
court,
there
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
for
the
state
to
have
a
statute
which
required
suspension
of
their
driver's
licenses
for
non-payment
of
judgments
arising
from
auto
accidents,
even
when
there
had
been
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy,
and
the
reason
was
that
that
penalized
them
on
account
of
something
granted
by
federal
law.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
yes,
indeed,
penalized
them
as
compared
to
other
people.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
that
wouldn't
be...
that
wouldn't
be
penalizing
them
if
that
was
true
of
other
people
as
well.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
i
think
that
it
would
be...
if
they
were
being
treated
differently
than
citizens
and
immigrants,
and
on
account
of
the
fact
that
they
had
a
federal
tax
exemption,
then
that
would
not
be
something
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
federal
tax
exemption.
congress--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--they
do
in
most
situations.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
well,
they
might
have
a
classification
there
that
would
be
treating
all
aliens
differently,
which
we
know
is
subject
to
strict
53
scrutiny.
but
the--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--as
compared
to
citizens.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
if
citizens
were
being
taxed--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--well,
then,
they
would
not--
mr.
james
r.
bieke
--then
we
would
have
no
beef.
mr.
james
r.
bieke
now,
it
is
not...
we
don't
know
exactly
which
ground
the
university
ultimately
relies
on.
it
appears
to
say
that
these
g-4
visa
holders
domiciled
in
maryland
are
treated
differently
from
other
domiciliaries
because
of
their
immigration
status.
it
not
that
it
just
appears
to
be
so.
that
is
what
the
policy
says.
the
only
difference
between
them
is
their
immigration
status,
and
that
is
something
that
is
treating
them
differently
on
account
of
their
visa
status,
which
is
assigned
by
congress,
and
that
they
can't
do.
they
cannot
impose
discriminatory
burdens
on
them
on
account
of
that.
and
if
their
reliance
is
on
the
tax
ground,
the
fact
that
they
don't
pay
full
taxes
on
the
salaries,
then
that
must
fall,
too,
for
the
54
same
reason.
they
are
being
penalized
on
account
of
their
tax
exemption.
here,
the
university's
discriminatory
treatment
of
g-4
visa
holders
who
are
domiciled
in
maryland
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
judgment
that
they
are
entitled
both
to
be
domiciled
in
this
country
and
to
have
a
tax
exemption.
all
we
are
seeking,
in
other
words,
is
equal
treatment
with
citizens
and
immigrants,
and
the
university's
failure
to
provide
that
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause.
thank
you.
