unknown
speaker
annually?
unknown
speaker
in
what
category?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
497
non-resident
aliens,
fill
that
in
a
little
bit.
who
are
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
that
group
composed
of?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
all
of
them
have
the
non-immigrant
g-4
visas?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
case
involves
only
the
g-4
visa
people?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
because
i
am
a
little
puzzled,
you
say
there
are
70
g-4
aliens
in
the
class
that
are
paying
the
higher
tuition?
unknown
speaker
does
this
case
involve
anything
but
those
people?
unknown
speaker
do
they
all
have
the
same
tax
exemption
that
the
g-4
people
do?
unknown
speaker
but
then
your
rationale
doesn't
apply
to
them.
unknown
speaker
i
am
puzzled.
i
don't
know
what...
now
i
am
really--
unknown
speaker
--if
i
understand
you
correctly,
your
justification
applies
to
70
people
in
a
class
of
497.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
tell
us
about
the
tax
exemption
of
the
other
427
people?
unknown
speaker
is
this
in
the
briefs,
all
this?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
they
pay
all...
resident
aliens
pay
all
taxes,
you
mean
federal
and
state
income
taxes?
unknown
speaker
and
all
property
taxes?
unknown
speaker
and
sales
taxes?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
category
that
has
access,
for
example,
to
tax-free
stores
equivalent
to
our
post
exchanges
in
other
countries?
unknown
speaker
none
in
maryland,
at
any
rate?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
that
is
by
federal
statute,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
going
to
address
the
pre-emption
argument
here,
too.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
many
of
the
things
you
are
talking
about
seem
to
me
bear
on
the
pre-emption
question,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
first
about
this
class
again?
unknown
speaker
of
these
497
people,
how
many
of
them
are
eligible
for
domicile?
unknown
speaker
and
you
still
exclude
non-domiciliaries
independently,
regardless
of
whether
they
are--
unknown
speaker
--so
we
don't
know
how
many
of
these
497
will
be
excluded
from
the
in
tuition
rate
because
they
are
not
eligible
to
be
domiciled?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
is
the
amended
policy,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
time
when
domicile
was
important.
that
is
why
we
sent
it
back,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
we
should
judge
this
case
as
though
all
of
the
group
that
are
involved
here--
unknown
speaker
--could
acquire
domicile.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zarnoch,
then
the
class
includes
more
than
the
g-4
aliens.
unknown
speaker
and
we
are
dealing
with
all
non-immigrant
aliens.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
all
excluded
from
these
tuition...
the
tuition
break.
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
whether
they
are
domiciliaries.
unknown
speaker
based
on
the
fact
that
they
don't
pay
state
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
through
the
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
because
they
would
be
paying
state
sales
taxes
if
you
have
them
or
other
taxes.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
does
this
court
have
to
overrule
vlandis
versus
kline
to
uphold
maryland's
scheme?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
back
tuition?
how
about
the
refund?
don't
you
have
to
overrule
vlandis
if
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean,
even
on
the
refund?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that...
didn't
the
court
say
your
former
policy
was
invalid?
unknown
speaker
under
vlandis
against
kline?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
what
about
that
period?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
about
the
prospective
validity
of
your
policy,
but
how
about
the
refund
for
that
period
that
the
court
has
already
held
violated
vlandis
against
kline?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
so
you
do
say--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
do
you
pursue
the
argument
that
you
can
treat
these
people
differently?
could
you
deny
them,
say,
garbage
collection
services,
or
police
protection,
without
charging
them
a
special
fee
for
it,
say?
unknown
speaker
so
are
you
other
state
services.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
because
they
pay
property
taxes--
unknown
speaker
--as
opposed
to
income
taxes.
unknown
speaker
does
your
budget...
your
university's
budget
is
derived
entirely
from
income
tax,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
none
of
the
property
taxes
go
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
they
also
use
federal
funds.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
class
includes
more
than
the
g-4
aliens.
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
federal
policy
concerning
non-liability
for
income
tax
for
the
g-4's
extend
to
the
other
non-immigrants?
unknown
speaker
so
we
should
assume
that
everyone
in
the
class
under
the
federal
tax
structure
would
not
be
in--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
and
maryland's
primary
concern
is
the
fact
that
these
people
aren't
contributing--
unknown
speaker
--state
income
taxes.
unknown
speaker
and
does
that
mean
that
we
do
have
some
kind
of
a
supremacy
clause
problem
of
some
significance
because
the
policies
appear
to
be
in
opposition?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
you
have
just
told
us
to
ignore
that.
unknown
speaker
general,
do
you
have
any
figure
on
what
percentage
of
the
costs
tuition
is?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
the
record,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
total
cost
of...
what
about
an
undergraduate
at
the
university
of
maryland?
you
must
have
some
figure
as
to
what
your
cost
of
educating
an
undergraduate
for--
unknown
speaker
--but
there
is
a
substantial
subsidy,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
how
about
for
out-of-state?
unknown
speaker
out-of-state
tuition?
would
out-of-state
tuition
almost,
or
not
quite--
unknown
speaker
--or
not
even
close?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
tuition
differential
for
a
resident
and
a
non-resident?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
two
figures?
unknown
speaker
$1,800
a
year.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
income
tax
rate
in
maryland?
unknown
speaker
so
somebody
earning
$20,000
a
year
would
pay
$1,000
in
taxes?
he
wouldn't
pay
as
much
as
the
differential,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
does
the
university
derive
income
from
the
state
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
the
state's
budget
comes
from
income
taxes
as
compared
with
sales
taxes?
unknown
speaker
were
the
named
parties
to
this
case
all
g-4's?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
objection
from
either
party
when
the
district
court
certified
a
broader
class
than
g-4?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
only
issue
we
have
before
us
then
is
g-4's?
unknown
speaker
so
you
disagree
with
the
attorney
general's
characterization
of
the
class.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bieke,
i
am
not
sure
your
colleague
said
the
class
before
the
court.
he
said
the
class
to
which
the
university's
policy
applies.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
disagree
with
him
on
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
on
its
face,
it
applies
to
all
non-immigrant
aliens,
whether
they
are
discriminated
against
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
said
whether
or
not.
that's
true.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
putting
it
a
little
differently,
if
you
win
this
case,
only
a
handful
of
people
will
get
a
benefit,
namely,
the
g-4's
and
two
or
three
others.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
the
rest
of
this
497
will
still
be
ineligible
for
the
lower
rate
because
they
are
not
eligible
to
be
domiciled?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us
how
many
people,
then,
you
say
are
in
the
category
which
will
be
affected
by
this
court's
determination?
unknown
speaker
so
we
are
really
dealing
only
with
about
70
people?
unknown
speaker
in
some
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
indicate
that
in
fact
the
difference
of
the
tuition
is
being
paid
by
the
companies
that
employ
these
people,
and
the
students
who
are
constituting
the
class
are
not
out
of
pocket
anything.
if
that
be
the
case,
how
do
they
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
how
about
welfare
payments?
would
they
be
eligible
for
welfare?
unknown
speaker
medicare
and
medicaid,
all
the--
unknown
speaker
--counsel--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
were
to
determine
that
the
non-immigrant
aliens
were
not
entitled
to
strict
scrutiny,
would
you
concede
that
the
maryland
policy
would
meet
the
rational
basis
test?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
get
back
to
my
question.
assume
for
purposes
of
answering
this
question
only
that
we
do
not
apply
any
kind
of
heightened
scrutiny
to
this
class.
then
how
do
you
have
your
rational
basis?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
have
to
rely
on
vlandis
versus
kline
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
whole
different--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
federal
government
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law
provided
that
g-4's
should
not
have
to
pay
any
federal
or
state
taxes,
and
the
university
of
maryland
accordingly
adopted
the
policy
it
has?
would
you
say
that
that
policy
couldn't
survive
rational
scrutiny,
rational
basis?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
am
just
asking
about
rational
basis.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
presumably
pay
some
taxes.
your
people
have
a
very
good
deal
in
that
regard.
unknown
speaker
are
the
immigrant
visa
holders
exempt
by
virtue
of
the
place
where
they
work?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bieke,
which...
is
the
supremacy
issue
here?
it
is,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
which...
if
you
were
going
to
win,
which
ground
would
you
prefer?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
think
they
may
be
sufficient,
but
there
are
certainly
different
consequences,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
so
i
ask
you
again,
which
would
you
prefer?
unknown
speaker
which
is
better?
which
is
best
for
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
we
decide
on
the
supremacy
clause
basis,
and
then
congress,
instead
of
saying
the
aliens
should
be
exempt
from
further
taxes,
say
that,
and
furthermore,
the
states
may
charge
non-immigrants
out-of-state
tuition?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
so...
but
if
we
decide
it
on
equal
protection
grounds,
like
you
suggest,
congress
couldn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
congress
couldn't...
congress
then,
they
might
say,
get
rid
of
the
supremacy
clause,
but
they
couldn't
get
rid
of
the
equal
protection
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
there
are
50
states
in
here.
unknown
speaker
fifty
states,
and
this
judgment
is
going
to
control
not
just
the
few
handful
of
people
that
you
suggest
who
live
in
maryland,
but
all
over
the
country,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
are
more--
unknown
speaker
--well,
there
are
going
to
be
more
than
live
in
maryland,
though.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
this
will
embrace
all
of
the
un
personnel
and
the
subsidiary
agencies,
will
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
that
i
follow
that
argument
completely.
i
mean,
isn't
the
state
entitled
to
take
the
factual
situation
which
confronts
it
as
46
brought
about
by
the
act
of
congress
and
deal
with
that
accordingly?
unknown
speaker
well,
also
the
fact
they
don't
pay
state
income
tax,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
the
state
isn't
trying
to
collect
state
income
tax.
it
is
just
saying
that
for
people
who
don't
pay
state
income
tax,
we
are
going
to
treat
them
differently
than
people
who
do.
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
anything
very
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
what
if
maryland
were
to
conduct
a
lottery,
and
the
only
way
you
could
get
into
the
lottery
was
by
filing
a
receipt
for
your
income
tax
return
last
year,
so
that
in
effect
the
lottery
was
limited
to
people
who
paid
maryland
income
tax.
now,
these
people
obviously
couldn't
participate
in
the
lottery.
would
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
take
the
example
of
those
few
who
don't
pay
an
income
tax
on
their
salary,
or
whose
salary
is
their
only
income,
so
that
they
would
be
disqualified.
would
you
say
that
the
lottery
violates
the
supremacy
clause?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bieke,
until
now,
at
least,
this
court
has
not
applied
a
supremacy
clause
analysis
to
cases
involving
aliens,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
relying
on
the
supremacy
ground,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
language
in
it
to
that
effect,
but
do
you
think
we
can
really
say
they
were
based
on
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
has
the
court
applied,
in
your
view,
heightened
scrutiny
to
cases
of
non-immigrant
50
aliens?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
the
same
with
respect
to
a
non-resident
hunting
license,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
charge
$50
to
go
duck
hunting
in
maryland,
but
$100
for
non-residents.
unknown
speaker
no,
citizen,
$50,
your
category,
your
class
of
people
$100.
unknown
speaker
what
if
maryland
had
a
rule
that
people
who
don't
pay
the
income
tax
shall
pay
a
slightly
higher
property
tax?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
penalized
them
as
compared
with
other
people.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't...
if
maryland
said,
well,
we
will
just
start
taxing
these
people
on
their
foreign
source
income?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
wouldn't...
say
they
just,
people
who
are
not,
who
are
exempt
from
federal
income
tax,
we
are
going
to
start
charging,
taxing
their
foreign
source
income.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
taxed
the
foreign
source
income
of
all
aliens.
of
course,
they
do
tax
foreign
source
income
of
citizens
now,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
if
they
taxed
the
foreign
source
income
of
all
aliens,
you
wouldn't
have
much
of
a
beef.
unknown
speaker
as
compared
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
getting
a--
unknown
speaker
--we
are
going
to...
well,
citizens
do
pay
taxes.
unknown
speaker
on
foreign
source
income.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
part
of
the
submission
here
is
that...
on
the
supremacy
clause
ground
is
that
maryland
may
not
deny
them
domicile.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
isn't
that
their
submission,
part
of
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
the
federal
government--
unknown
speaker
--the
federal
government
says
they
may
be
domiciled
in
this
country.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one--
