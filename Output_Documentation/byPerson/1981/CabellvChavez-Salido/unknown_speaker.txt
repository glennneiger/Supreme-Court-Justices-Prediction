unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
when
you
say
that
the
scheme
was
considered
overbroad,
i
take
it
you
are
referring
to
the
court's
language
in
sugarman
against
dougall
that
a
narrowly
tailored
scheme
would
do.
do
you
think
that
has
to
do
with
statutory
draftsmanship
as
to
what
positions
are
included
and
what
are
not?
or
just
rather
vague
language
in
the
statute
itself?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
court's
language,
our
court,
our
language
focus
on
the
fact
that
it
included
garbage
collectors?
unknown
speaker
the
california
statutes
are
just
about
as
bad
as
new
york,
aren't
they?
you
cover
cemetery
sextons
and
toll
takers,
and
demand
citizenship
for
those
as
well,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
glad
to
hear
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
case
just
deals
with
probation
officers.
unknown
speaker
why
should
this
person
be
entitled
to
say
the
statute
is
invalid
because
it
applies
to
some
other
people,
too?
unknown
speaker
do
you
thank
sugarman
held
that
somebody
had
standing
to
do
that,
or
only
that
the
overbreadth
was
evidence
of...
was
relevant
to
whether
and
what
kind
of
a
justification
the
state
might
claim?
if
you
are
claiming
a
certain
justification,
it
is
awful
hard
to
say
that
justification
would
apply
to
just
everybody.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
purports
to,
it
tends
to
impugn
the
justification.
isn't
that
what--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
stewart,
if
we
were
to
agree
that
deputy
probation
officers
as
police
officers
cannot
be
required
constitutionally
to
be
united
states
citizens,
do
we
have
to
reach
this
overbreadth
argument
at
all?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
says
peace
officers,
the
second
question,
but
since
the
only
three
applicants
here
are
deputy
probation
officers--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
we
held
that
they
may
be
excluded?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
suppose
we
hold
that
the
state
may
require
probation
officers
to
be
citizens?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
mr.
stewart,
that
is
to
suggest
that
no
matter
how
we
come
out
on
question
one,
we
ought
not
answer
question
two.
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
three
persons
involved
here,
don't
you?
one
of
them
is
now
a
probation
officer.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
briefs
indicated
he
had
acquired
his
citizenship
and
was
employed.
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
other
two?
have
they
acquired
citizenship?
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
matter
of
information,
you
do
have
some
peace
officers
in
california
authorized
to
carry
arms
who
need
not
be
citizens?
unknown
speaker
i
commend
to
you
then
california
penal
code
section
830.7.
unknown
speaker
that,
of
course,
is
not
what
it
said.
unknown
speaker
under
california
law,
in
practice,
do
they
give
the
sentencing
judge
a
pre
sentence
report?
unknown
speaker
do
they
recommend...
are
they
authorized
to
recommend
revocation
of
probation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
what
is
it
about
being
a
non
citizen,
being
an
alien,
that
affects
one's
ability
to
prepare
a
pre
sentence
report?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
about
recommending
sentence
as
opposed
to
probation?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
there
is
something
about
being
a
non
citizen
that
means
that
that
person
can't
do
that
job
effectively?
unknown
speaker
in
all
of
the
others,
the
officer
involved
deals
with
the
whole
public.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
the
officer
can
involve
himself
with
anybody
in
the
public,
but
the
probation
officer
is
limited
to
only
probationers.
isn't
that
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
only
juveniles.
unknown
speaker
they
are
only
juveniles.
they
wouldn't
come
in
contact
with
you
or
me,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
we
stayed
out
of
trouble.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
different
from
a
state
trooper.
unknown
speaker
yes.
is
he
more
narrow
in
his
contacts
than,
say,
teachers?
unknown
speaker
but
teachers
are
addressed
primarily
to
juveniles
as
groups,
too,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
how
many
probationers
in
los
angeles
each
probation
officer
is
responsible
for?
unknown
speaker
why
did
the
amicus
think
that
was
relevant
to
any
of
the
issues
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
relevant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
would
you
outline
the
duties
of
a
probation
officer
with
respect
to
juveniles?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
all
under
the
supervision
of
the
social
worker?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
probation
officer
can
move
the
child
from
one
status
to
another
on
his
own?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
offender
population
in
the
county?
i
assume
there
must
be
some
significant
number
of
non
citizens,
spanish-speaking
non
citizens
who
may
be
offenders
in
los
angeles
county.
unknown
speaker
does
the
argument
about
the
citizenship
requirement
as
to
most
people
necessarily
apply
with
the
same
force
if
the
probation
officer's
people
with
whom
he
deals,
100
or
so
offenders,
if
they
are
all
non
citizens,
spanish-speaking,
and
so
forth?
what
is
the
relevance
there
for
insisting
that
you
not
have,
say,
a
non
citizen
who
might
be
more
like
the
people
he
is
responsible
for?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
was
wondering
what
in
that
particular
category,
what
is
it...
does
the
citizenship
requirement
in
that
category
perform
a
useful
function?
i
suppose
it
narrows
the
class
of
spanish-speaking
persons
that
are
eligible
for
employment,
and
is
that...
one
reason
i
ask
the
question
is
that
a
year
or
two
ago
we
had
a
case
involving
correction
officers
called
minick,
in
which
the
state
had
an
affirmative
policy
of
trying
to
get
different
minority
groups
because
they
might
be
able
to
relate
better
with
the
offenders
for
whom
they
were
responsible.
here
you
have
kind
of
a
different
approach
to
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
which
you
can't
do.
you
can't
take
aliens,
as
i
understand
your...
or
is
there
room
for
exceptions?
can
there
be
exceptions?
unknown
speaker
you
have
just
tied
your
own
hands
in
this
area.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
ambach
versus
norwick
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
that
an
alien
spanish-speaking
puerto
rican
might
have
related
better
to
students
in
new
york
schools
than
a
citizen
and
nonetheless
we
upheld
the
new
york
requirement
that
teachers
be
citizens.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
does
the
record
show
how
many
probation
officers
there
are
in
the
county
of
los
angeles?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
twenty-five
hundred?
do
you
have
any
idea
what
percentage
of
those
are
spanish-speaking
citizens?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
a
guess
would
not
be
very
helpful
for
us
unless
counsel
on
the
other
side
would
agree.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this,
since
i
have
interrupted
you?
one
of
the
appellees
had
become
a
citizen.
may
the
other
two
apply
for
citizenship?
have
they
been
here
long
enough
or
whatever
the
requirements
are
that
would
entitle
them
to
apply
for
citizenship?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
they
could
have
applied
in
1975.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
some
of
the
writers
in
this
field
have
suggested
that
the
regulation
of
aliens
has
really
been
pre
empted
by
the
federal
government.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
whether
the
federal
government
requires
probation
officers
to
be
citizens.
unknown
speaker
well,
administrative
exceptions
can
be
made,
can
they
not,
in
the
federal
government
to
employ
aliens?
unknown
speaker
if
the
convicted
criminal
has
any
rights
in
the
area,
is
there
anything
to
the
notion
that
an
american
citizen
might
think
he
had
some
right
to
have
a
probation
officer
supervising
him
or
advising
the
court
about
him
who
was
not
an
alien
citizen
of
another
country?
do
you
think
the
criminal
defendants
have
any
rights
in
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
are
we
really
concerned
with
anything
except
probation
officers
here?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
overbreadth
was
limited
to
freedom
of
speech.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
probably
a
poor
person
to
interpret
sugarman
since
i
dissented
in
that
case,
but
as
i
read
it,
it
simply
said
that
the
state
could
have
excluded
certain
jobs
from
aliens
but
that
it
simply
swept
with
too
broad
a
brush
substantively
rather
than
having
conduct
which
might
have
been
proscribed
get
off
free
because
you
couldn't
tell
what
it
meant.
unknown
speaker
but,
ms.
burdick,
if
we
agreed
that
as
applied
to
deputy
probation
officers
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
do
we
have
to
go
on
and
deal
with
the
overbreadth
issue
at
all?
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
a
class
action,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
it
is
time
this
court
fishes
or
cuts
bait
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
alienage
may
be
required,
or
may
be
prohibited
by
a
state
in
state
employment,
that
it
come
to
rest
somewhere
or
other
rather
than
deciding
each
case
on
an
ad
hoc
basis?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
judge
hill
tried
very
hard
to
follow
the
ambach
and
the
foley
cases?
unknown
speaker
and
they
divided
two
to
one.
unknown
speaker
ms.
burdick,
going
back
to
justice
white's
inquiry,
was
there
a
reason
why
this
wasn't
brought
as
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
we
couldn't
decide
this
as
a
class
action,
could
we?
unknown
speaker
we
could
not
decide
this
case
as
a
class
action,
could
we?
of
course
not,
because
it
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
can't
decide
this
single
class,
how
can
we
decide
the
whole
class
you
want
us
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
maybe
this
is
what
justice
white
already
asked,
but
whatever
reason
the
legislature
had
for
requiring
citizenship
for
probation
officers
must
also
apply
to
everybody
else
thrown
into
this
statute,
such
as
cemetery
sextons
and
the
like.
they
didn't
say,
well,
there
is
a
special...
they
didn't
separate
this,
probation
officers,
out
from
the
others,
and
whatever
the
reason
was
must
be
common
to
the
entire
group
covered
by
the
statute.
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
concede,
do
you
not,
that
you
represent
only
three
people
here
and
each
of
them
are
applicants
for
the
position
of
probation
officer.
unknown
speaker
the
attorney
general's
opinion
was
way
back
in
1970,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
before
foley
and
norwick,
ambach.
unknown
speaker
has
the
attorney
general
appeared
in
this
litigation
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
it
is
his
duty
to
defend
the
statute
under
california
law,
or
not?
is
that
to
be
imposed
on
the
county
officials?
unknown
speaker
on
your
first
criteria,
ms.
burdick,
do
you
mean
all
the
people
of
california,
all
the
people
of
los
angeles
county,
or
all
the
persons
criminally
convicted
in
los
angeles
county?
what
is
your
constituency
that
you
have
in
mind
for
that
first
criteria?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
what
constituency
you
were
talking
about
when
you
mentioned
your
first
criteria.
unknown
speaker
probation
officers
don't
deal
with
the
populace
generally,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
their
constituency
is
primarily
the
convicted
defendant,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
their
contacts
with
other
people
are
to
acquire
information
about
those
convicted
defendants.
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
did
i
correctly
understand
mr.
stewart
to
say
they
have
2,500
probation
officers?
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
speak
of
the
public,
certainly
the
public
speaks
through
the
legislature,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
when
the
legislature
says
that
a
probation
officer
must
be
a
citizen,
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
public
perceives
that
the
probation
officer
ought
to
be
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
ordinarily
require
that
all
state
legislative
or
for
that
matter
congressional
decisions
be
"reasoned",
do
we?
unknown
speaker
would
you
concede
that
citizenship
might
be
made
a
requirement
by
the
legislature
for
judges?
unknown
speaker
ms.
burdick,
just
out
of
curiosity,
is
the
prosecutor
in
los
angeles
county
required
to
be
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
he
does
have
to
be.
ms.
burdick,
could
i...
suppose
this
statute
that
is
here
in
section
1
said
all
school
teachers
must
be
citizens,
and
section
2,
all
policemen
must
be
citizens,
section
3,
all
other
peace
officers
must
be
citizens,
and
then
the
definition
of
police
officer
is
just
as
it
is
in
this
case,
and
suppose
your
clients
were
either
applicants
for
police
positions
or
as
teachers.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
argument,
that
because
the
statute
is
so
broad,
it
may
not
be
applied
to
teachers
or
police
officers?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
the
very
statute
here.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
first
two
sections
apply
to
teachers
and
police
officers,
and
your
clients
are
some
of
those
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
decide
that
probation
officers
are
more
like
police
officers?
and
that
if
the
only
section
there
was
in
the
statute
dealt
with
probation
officers,
you
would
lose.
do
you
think
you
should
win
because
the
statute
applies
to
some
other
positions?
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
legislature
did
go
back
and
craft,
as
you
say,
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
that
said
all
probation
officers
must
be
citizens.
would
you
feel
that
was
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
then
you
really
don't
need
the
overbreadth
argument
at
all,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
probation
officers
would
be
different
from
police
officers
and
teachers.
unknown
speaker
ms.
burdick,
do
you
think
the
court
should
consider
a
federal
pre
emption
standard
in
looking
at
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
ms.
burdick,
let
me
ask
you
one
thing.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
distinction
in
the
facts,
however
relevant
it
may
or
may
not
be,
between
this
case
and
ambach
in
that
your
people
were
willing
to
take
a
loyalty
oath
and
those
in
ambach
did
not
go
that
far?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
yours
are
willing?
unknown
speaker
how
did
you
arrive
at
that
one
tenth
of
1
percent?
i
missed
your
calculation.
unknown
speaker
population
of
los
angeles
county?
are
you
starting
with
that?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
the
total
number
of
persons
in
confinement
in
california
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
true
of
a
student
at
a
private
school,
nor
is
it
true
of
a
police
officer
if
he
makes
a
warrant,
unjustified,
warrantless
arrest,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
that
supervision
and
oversight
also
comes
from
his
lieutenant
and
his
captain?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
probation
officer
who
decides
to
suspend
probation
or
to
hold
the
first
of
the
morrissey
versus
brewer
hearings?
doesn't
he
have
the
initial
right
to
make
a
determination
that
there
is
grounds
for
holding
the
second
type
of
hearing
on
his
own?
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
the
right
to
institute
the
proceeding,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
isn't
a
probation
officer
an
arm
of
the
sentencing
judge
in
california?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
probationer
or
parolee
thinks
when
the
probation
officer
comes
around
to
have
a
chat
with
him?
does
he
think
that
had
something
to
do
with
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
are
the
probation
officers
in
california
permitted
to
carry
arms
under
some
circumstances
by
administrative
leave?
unknown
speaker
ms.
burdick,
do
they
wear
uniforms?
unknown
speaker
ms.
burdick,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
does
the
record
tell
us
how
these
people
are
appointed?
i
know
there
is
an
examination
of
some
kind.
who
is
the
appointing
authority?
unknown
speaker
and
who
runs
the
probation
department?
is
that
an
elected
office?
i
am
just
wondering
if
they
are
possibly
patronage
people.
unknown
speaker
could
you
answer
my
last
question?
you
probably
know.
how
are
they
appointed?
unknown
speaker
a
competitive
examination,
and
strictly
on
merit?
it
is
part
of
the
civil
service--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
who
appoints
them?
the
judge?
the
state's
attorney?
doesn't
somebody
appoint
them?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
mr.
stewart,
i
know
it
is
not
germane,
but
do
you
know
whether
there
is
any
constitutional
or
statutory
provision
that
requires
a
member
of
this
court
to
be
an
american
citizen?
unknown
speaker
or
even
a
lawyer?
i
don't
think
you
will
find
it.
well,
perhaps
the
question
is,
could
congress
pass
a
statute
requiring
members
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
true
that
everybody
who
works
for
the
government
exercises
some
of
the
government's
sovereign
power?
unknown
speaker
you
would
differentiate
between
the
governmental
functions
and
the
proprietary
functions,
is
your
basic
distinction.
unknown
speaker
how
about
an
accountant
for
the
probation
department?
unknown
speaker
how
about
an
accountant
for
the
probation
department?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
requirement
that
members
of
your
staff
have
to
be
citizens?
unknown
speaker
statutory,
county?
unknown
speaker
i
have
yet
to
run
across
a
bureaucrat
of
the
federal
or
state
government
who
wasn't
the
very
epitome
of
all
authority
in
government.
have
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
some
time
ago
justice
o'connor
asked
you
kind
of
a
double
question,
and
i
think
you
didn't
get
back
to
the
first
one.
are
you
persuaded
at
all
by
this
theory
of
pre
emption
that
some
of
the
academics
have
advanced
in
this
area?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
the
point
was
made
or
could
have
been
made?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
think
the
point
of
the
professorial
comments
is
that
this
is
the
way
out
of
this
wilderness,
and
line
drawing,
and
the
like,
to
adopt
a
theory
of
pre
emption.
you
wouldn't
like
that,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
