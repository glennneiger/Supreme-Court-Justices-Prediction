mr.
william
f.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
state
citizenship
requirements
for
certain
specified
classes
of
public
employees.
it
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three
judge
federal
court
holding
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
california
to
require
its
probation
officers
to
be
citizens,
and
that
further,
california's
statutory
scheme
which
required
peace
officers
in
several
enumerated
categories
to
be
citizens
was
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
all
applicants
for
only
one
peace
officer
position,
that
of
deputy
probation
officer
with
the
county
of
los
angeles.
this
is
the
second
appeal
in
the
case,
the
court
having
granted
the
appeal
and
remanded
it
back
to
the
three
judge
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
its
recently
published
decision
in
foley
versus
connelie.
the
second
time
around,
the
district
court
again
by
a
two
to
one
vote
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
require
citizenship
of
deputy
probation
officers,
and
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
california's
statutory
scheme
sets
forth
many
enumerated
and
specific
categories
of
peace
officers,
and
also
sets
forth
the
qualification
for
peace
officers,
one
of
which
is
citizenship
of
the
united
states.
the
california
statutory
scheme
also
considers
and
imposes
certain
training
requirements
on
the
enumerated
categories
of
peace
officers.
this
case
calls
once
again
on
this
court
to
consider
as
it
did
in
foley
and
ambach
whether
certain
occupations,
public
occupations,
in
this
case
probation
officers,
are
of
such
a
nature
that
they
can
be
constitutionally
limited
to
citizens.
the
second
issue,
of
course,
is
whether
or
not
the
california
statutory
scheme
was
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
we
believe
that
the
three
judge
federal
court
seriously
erred
when
it
concluded
that
the
probation
officer's
position
was
not
of
a
nature
that
citizenship
could
legitimately
be
required.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
think
that
the
sugarman
language
should
be
limited
to
the
context
of
that
particular
case
in
the
sense
that
in
sugarman
the
new
york
statute
struck
down
encompassed
all
classes
of
civil
service
servants
in
new
york
without
distinction.
that's
the--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
it
was
overbroad
because
it
included
all
categories
of
civil
servants,
from
garbage
collectors
to
clerk
typists
to
perhaps
police
officers
and
the
like.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
we
no
longer
demand
citizenship
of
sextons,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
the
california
legislature
in
1980
took
another
look
at
the
statute,
and
there
were
several
categories
that
were
eliminated,
of
which
one
category
was
cemetery
sextons,
custodial
officers,
and
there
were
several
other
categories,
but
the
difference
between
the
california
statute
and
that
of
new
york
is
that
they
specifically
for
one
thing,
it
deals
with
one
generic
class,
that
is,
a
peace
officer.
they
all
possess
certain
peace
officer
characteristics.
secondly,
each
of
the
specific
peace
officer
categories
is
specifically
delineated
in
separate
subsections
of
the
code,
so
we
have
one
section
dealing
in
our
case
with
probation
officer,
another
dealing
with
sheriffs
and
police
officers,
another
one
dealing
with
highway
patrol
and
various
other
categories.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
precisely,
your
honor.
this
case--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--that
is
exactly
our
point.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
all
three
of
them
are
applicants
for
only
one
of
the
classified
statutory
positions.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
exactly
right.
we--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--that
is
the
position
that
we...
that
is
the
way
we
read
sugarman,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
don't
believe
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
think
that
that
question--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--that
is
right.
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
the
other
argument.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
may
be
limited
to
peace
officers.
i
think
then
that--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--i
think
then
that
the
court
need
not
consider
the
overbreadth
question,
because
in
this
particular
case
the
applicants
were
just
for
the
deputy
probation
officer
position.
deputy
probation
officers
are
specifically
declined
as
a
precise
class
of
peace
officer
in
the
statute.
it
is
not
a
generic
term.
and
that
the
other
categories,
if
they
are
constitutionally
defective,
should
be
addressed
in
a
separate
suit
with
parties
withstanding,
and
where
the
evidence
could
be
developed
as
to
the
particular
tasks
involved
in
that...
in
those
jobs.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court,
by
simply
saying
that
the
california
statute
was
unconstitutionally
overbroad,
without
consideration
in
detail
of
the
sub
categories
of
peace
officers,
concluded
that
they
were
not
legitimately
restricted
to
citizens,
and
completely
eliminated
the
citizenship
requirements,
some
of
which,
for
highway
patrolman,
police,
and
sheriff,
this
court
has
already
held
are
legitimate
qualifications.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
believe
that
is
the
position
i
take,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
don't
believe
so,
sir.
he
left
county
service.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
i
believe
the
second
opinion
indicated
that
he
had
left
county
service
after
he
had
acquired
his
citizenship.
he
is
no
longer
a
probation
officer.
but
the
court
in,
i
believe
it
was
a
footnote
in
their
second
opinion,
stated
that
his
cause
was
still
right
because
he
still
had
his
claim
for
back
pay
and
other
damages.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
they
have
not,
your
honor.
nor
did
they
indicate
any
intention
to
acquire
citizenship.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
a
fact,
sir.
this
court
in
the
sugarman
case--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--of
course,
not
all
peace
officers,
your
honor,
are
authorized
to
carry
weapons
in
california.
it
is
up
to
their
particular--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--it
is
up
to
their
particular
jurisdiction
or
the
employer
that
allows
them
to
carry
weapons.
in
foley
and
ambach,
this
court
in
a
more
precise
and
narrow
context
applied
its
guidance
in
sugarman.
in
foley,
the
court
upheld
the
citizenship
requirement
for
police
officers,
and
in
ambach
for
teachers.
the
question
then
is
whether
or
not
the
job
characteristics
of
a
probation
officer
fall
on
the
foley-ambach
side,
which
justifies
citizenship.
measured
against
the
criteria
the
court
considered
in
foley
and
ambach,
we
believe
that
the
deputy
probation
officer
positions
clearly
perform
significant
governmental
functions
that
would
justify
the
imposition
of
a
citizenship
requirement.
this
court
perhaps
other
than
attorneys
are
most
familiar
with
the
functions
of
a
probation
officer.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
they
do.
they
are
required
to
provide
a
pre
sentence
report
in
all
cases.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
they
possess
in
california,
i
believe,
all
of
the
essential
probation
officer
powers
that
exist
in
most
states
and
in
the
federal
government.
in
fact,
i
believe
on
of
the
amicus
for
the
appellees
indicated
that
there
is
really
essentially
no
difference
in
the
probation
officer's
powers
in
california
between
those
exercised
generally
and
also
in
the
federal
government.
so
they
possess
the
power
to--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--well,
if
you
zeroed
in
on
just
that
one
facet
of
the
probation
officer's
functions,
whether
he
was
a
citizen
or
not
may
not--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--i
think
that
is
a
significant
factor,
because
by
making
that
recommendation,
it
assumes
that
the
court
will
take
some
cognizance
of
it.
the
probation
officer
is
exercising
a
sovereign
power
of
the
government,
making
a
recommendation
as
to
the
liberty
of
an
individual,
and
it
forms
an
extremely
important
part
of
our
criminal
justice
process,
which
is
bottomed
on
the
concept
of
rehabilitation.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
not
perhaps
in
a
technical
sense,
but
the
same
type
of
qualification
would
apply
to
a
deputy
probation
officer
as
the
court
found
existed
in
foley
and
in
ambach,
particularly
in
foley,
because
the
probation
officers
here
are
involved
closely
as
an
integral
part
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
in
a
sense,
they
are
almost
an
arm
of
the
court.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
involves
the
entire
public,
sir?
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
don't
think
it
is
a
difference
that
is
constitutionally
significant
because
the
probation
officer--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--because
the
probation
officer
performs
activities
on
behalf
of
society
as
a
whole.
there
are
many
jobs
in
government
that
are
significant,
that
perform
significant
governmental
functions
which
do
not
on
a
daily
basis
meet
all
of
the
public.
i
think
that
is
too
narrow
a
concept
for
determining
whether
or
not
the
job
performs
significant
governmental
functions.
in
the
case
of
juveniles,
the
probation
officer's
capacity
is
much
broader
in
california,
because
they
come
into
contact
with
juveniles
that
may
not
be
offenders,
or
have
not
got
to
the
stage
where
they
would
be
charged
with
some
sort
of
criminal
activity.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
f.
stewart
not
unless
we
were--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
it
is
more
narrow
in
the
sense
of
its
contacts
than
a
state
trooper.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
in
the
sense
that
the
teacher
would
address
a
class
or
be
associated
with
a
class
on
a
day
to
day
basis,
whereas
a
probation
officer
is
directed
primarily
toward
juveniles
as
a
group
or
adult
offenders.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that's
correct.
they
do
not
relate
in
a
broad
sense
to
adults.
they
focus
primarily
on
the
juveniles
and
those
that
are
in
their
class.
but
in
both
instances
the
probation
officer
performs
a
function
representing
the
state
on
behalf
of
society
as
a
whole,
in
attempting
to
establish
rehabilitation,
establish
guidance
for
juveniles
as
well
as
adults,
and
i
think
that
this
particular
function
or
facet
of
this
position
relates
very
closely
to
the
significant
governmental
powers
that
this
court
felt
were
important
in
determining
whether
or
not
citizenship
could
validly
be
required.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
believe
it
varies,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
but
there
were
some
remarks
made
by
one
of
the
amicuses
as
to
the
work
load,
but
i
believe
their
case
load
now
is
somewhere
around
100
offenders.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
they
apparently
felt
because
their
work
load
was
such
that
they
were
mere
functionaries,
and
used
that
statistic
to
try
to
buttress
their
argument.
that
is
the
only
relevance
that
at
least
was
expressed
in
their
brief.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes.
the
duties
of
a
probation
officer
with
respect
to
juveniles
can
be
divided
into
perhaps
two
categories,
those
which
could
be
considered
delinquents
and
those
that
could
be
considered
to
be
abandoned,
neglected,
or
abused
children
in
california.
as
far
as
delinquents
are
concerned,
they
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
take
a
juvenile
into
custody
because
of
some
offense,
whether
or
not
to
divert
him
into
the
criminal
justice
system
or
to
release
him
back
to
his
parents
or
to
some
informal
method
of
treating
the
individual.
they
can
determine
whether
or
not
charges
should
be
filed
against
a
juvenile.
the
juvenile
can
be
remanded
to
the
custody
of
the
deputy
probation
officer
at
the
determination
of
the
juvenile
judge
and
put
under
a
program
of
corrective
behavior
and
restrictions
somewhat
similar
to
conditions
of
parole.
the
probation
officers
in
los
angeles
county
run
juvenile
camps,
have
sole
jurisdiction
over
approximately
nine
or
ten
juvenile
camps
in
los
angeles
county.
with
regard
to
the
non
delinquent
children,
their
powers
are
very
extensive.
they
act
as
sort
of
a
parens
patriae
concept.
they
can
come
in
and
seek
to
remove
the
child
from
the
custody
of
its
parents
because
of
abuse
or
neglect.
once
again,
the
court
can
remand
the
juvenile
back
into
the
custody
of
the
probation
officer
to
be
put
under
a
program
or
put
into
his
protective
custody
and
moved
into
a
foster
home,
or
under
one
of
the
juvenile
halls,
not
the
juvenile
hall
in
the
delinquent
sense,
but
we
have
a
juvenile
hall
that
has
children
that
have
been
abandonded
or
neglected,
and
they
were
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
probation
department
up
until
just
a
couple
of
years
ago,
but
in
other
counties
they
are
still
under
the
control
of
the
probation
department.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
the
only...
only
the
abandoned,
neglected,
and
abused
child
does
the
social
worker
have
a
role,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
was
referring
to
a
delinquent
child.
where
the
child
is
adjudged
to
be
a
delinquent,
under
a
separate
section
of
our
code,
the
social
worker
does
not
have
any
role
in
that.
it
is
only
in
the
abandoned,
abused,
and
neglected
category
that
the
social
worker
has
a
role,
and
generally
it
depends
on
the
county
that
you
are
in.
in
los
angeles
county,
the
probation...
the
welfare
department
is
quite
extensive,
and
they
do
play
a
substantial
role
in
the
placing
of
the
child
into
foster
homes
and
the
like.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
the
offender
record
or
what
their
alien
background
is.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
the
individual,
whether
he
is
an
alien
or
not,
is
still
under
the
jurisdiction
of
our
system
of
criminal
laws
and
our
constitutional
protection,
so
it
is
not
similar
to
a
situation
where
a
probation
officer
may
be
acting
outside
of
the
country.
the
probation
officer
is
representing
the
court
and
our
criminal
justice
system.
and
secondly,
as
far
as
relating,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
whether
he
is
alien
or
non
alien
in
terms
of
relating
to
a
particular
offender.
if
it
is
a
question
of
language,
then
we
have
the
special
category
of
spanish-speaking
probation
officers
in
los
angeles
county
that
have
preference
in
hiring,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
they
are
citizens,
but
it
was...
they
were
designed
to
address
the
problem
and
perhaps
some
problems
in
language
communication,
but
i
do
not
feel
that
a
non
alien
probation
officer
would
relate
any
better
to
a
non
alien
offender.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
we
believe
we
can
do
it,
but
it
doesn't
require
that
he
be
a...
or
that
citizens
of
the
united
states--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--no.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
having
an
alien
probation
officer
does
not
in
my
view
enhance
the
relationship
between
himself
and
a
non
alien
offender,
that
in
los
angeles
county
in
particular
there
is
a
large
number
of
citizen
spanish-speaking
individuals
of
spanish
or
hispanic
background
that
can
relate
very
well
with
the
criminal
offenders,
whether
of
the
spanish
or
other
race,
or
whether
he
is
an
alien
or
he
is
not
an
alien.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
and
i
believe
it
would
apply
equally
well
to
the
foley
case,
because
there
have
been
efforts,
of
course,
for
the
police
department
to
more
adequately
or
more
broadly
represent
the
structure
of
society,
yet
you
upheld
a
citizenship
requirement
for
police
officers,
and
they
relate
as
well
to
non
alien
offenders.
i
find
no
distinction
between
foley
and
ambach
in
that
regard.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
the
record
does
not
show
that.
i
can
represent
to
the
court
what--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--yes,
it
is,
and
it
is
approximately
2,500.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
believe
that
the
percentage
of
them
are
approximately,
and
this
is
a
guess,
in
the
vicinity
of
20
percent,
15
to
20
percent.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
i
understand,
your
honor,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
that.
i
can
represent
that
the
county
does
have
the
spanish-speaking
qualification,
which
allows
a
preference
in
hiring
for
probation
officers.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
am
sure
that
they
would,
and
i
say
that
only
because
this
case
began
in
1975,
and
it
is
now
1981,
and
i
believe
there
is
a
five
year--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
the
federal
government
requires
all
their
civil
servants
to
be
citizens.
the
court
considered
the
federal
government's
restriction
to
citizenship
in
the
hampton
case,
and
i
understand
that
the
president
then
issued
a
directive
requiring
citizenship
of
most
classifications
of
civil
servants.
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
believe
that
they
did.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
am
sure
that
there
can,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
don't
think
the
criminal
defendants
have
a
right
to
a
particular
type
of
probation
officer.
i
think
that
is
up
to
the
court
and
the
probation
authorities
to
determine
the
best
qualified
probation
officer
without
regard
to
whether
he
is
an
alien
or
not
an
alien.
i
have
emphasized
the
power
of
the
probation
officer
with
regard
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
but
it
is
clear
that
in
that
exercise
of
power
they
exert
or
execute
vast
discretionary
powers,
not
only
with
the
pre
sentencing
report
and
recommendations
to
the
court.
they
act
in
a
quasi
judicial
capacity
and
have
teen
held
to
act
in
that
capacity
and
are
entitled
to
immunity
as
a
judge
would
be
for
acting
in
a
quasi
judicial
capacity.
they
also
possess
peace
officer
status,
and
while
it
is
not
exercised
to
the
same
extent
as
a
policeman,
they
can
exercise
a
peace
officer
status
and
take
a
probationer
who
has
violated
probation
into
custody.
they
exercise
vast
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
condition
of
parole
has
been
violated,
and
if
it
has,
what
should
be
the
disposition.
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
he
will
automatically
request
a
revocation
of
parole.
i
think
just
by
virtue
of
the
extensive,
expansive
authority
of
a
probation
officer
over
juveniles,
that
itself
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
the
imposition
of
a
citizenship
requirement.
they
are
clearly
when
you
review
their
entire
functions
not
mere
functionaries,
but
they
form
the
core
of
the
state's
philosophy
regarding
rehabilitation
of
criminals.
as
the
crime
rate
increases,
the
function
of
a
probation
officer
becomes
more
and
more
important.
as
the
aba
announced
or
stated
in
their
report
on
probation,
that
it
is
one
of
the
central
features
of
our
criminal
justice
system,
and
more
and
more
the
courts
have
come
to
rely
on
probationers,
probation
officers.
as
such,
they
certainly
execute
a
significant
and
important
governmental
function,
in
my
view
far
expanding
in
many
respects
that
of
a
police
officer
in
foley
and
a
teacher
in
ambach.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--yes.
they
are
appointed
by
competitive
examination.
they
are
not
patronage.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
appoint
the
individual
probation
officers?
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
they
are
appointed
by
the
chief
probation
officer,
and
based
upon
a
competitive
civil
service
list.
i
agree
with
the
appellees
that
some
lines
should
be
drawn,
but
i
believe
that
the
lines
drawn
by
the
appellees
are
too
narrow
and
inappropriate
for
this
particular
job
function.
probation
officers
advise
their
juveniles
of
constitutional
rights.
moreover,
if
they
act
as
legal
advisors
to
juveniles,
they
act
as
a
public
legal
advisor,
in
a
sense,
and
this
court,
while
it
held
that
citizenship
could
not
be
required
of
private
attorneys,
the
court
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
whether
or
not
citizenship
could
be
required
of
public
counsel.
now,
judges
and
prosecutors
also
have
somewhat
limited
contact,
yet
as
an
integral
part
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
of
which
he
probation
officer
is
a
part,
they
can
legitimately
be
required
to
be
citizens.
i
believe
that
the
appellees
have
failed
to
articulate
any
viable
reason
as
to
why
probation
officers
should
be
excluded
from
that
team
of
judge,
prosecutor,
and
police
officer,
and
could
not
be
limited
to
citizens.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
believe
they
could,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
could,
and
i
believe
california
could
pass
a
statute
that
requires
their
police
officers
and
their
probation
officers
and
their
judges
and
their
prosecutors
to
be
citizens
as
well,
because
i
think
the
standard
here
is
too
narrow
that
they
have
articulated,
but
it
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
has
been
given
or
cloaked
with
some
aspect
of
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state.
this
court
has
said
that
the
states
should
be
given
broad
power
to
structure
their
political
community,
and
i
think
probation
officers
clearly
fall
within
that
political
community.
they
exercise
a
sovereign--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
there
are
jobs
that
are
government
employment,
but
there
are
other
jobs,
and
we
make
this
distinction
in
municipal
law
between
a
governmental
officer
who
exercises
a
sovereign
power--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--yes,
between
the
type
of
employment
such
as
a
clerk
typist
or
an
engineer
or
an
accountant
who
may
work
with
the
government
or
he
may
work
outside
the
government.
when
you
are
dealing
with--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--pardon
me?
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
don't
believe
that
he
could
be
restricted
to
be
a
citizen.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
there
is
a
requirement
that--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--a
statutory
requirement
that
county--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--well,
i
would
like
to
be
a
little
more
modest
than
that,
your
honor.
we
do
draw
a
distinction,
though,
in
civil
law
between
a
governmental
employee
and
one
who
is
a
governmental
officer
in
the
sense
of
possessing
and
exercising
sovereign
powers,
and
here,
the
state
of
california
has
conditioned
a
grant
of
some
of
their
sovereign
powers
upon
citizenship,
in
a
bond
that
is
simply
an
oath
will
not
suffice.
if
an
oath
would
suffice,
then
why
even
require
citizenship?
you
have
done
away
with
the
requirement
of
citizenship
if
someone
merely
can
give
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
or
to
obey
the
law
in
lieu
of
citizenship.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
i
do
not,
because
that
same
point
could
have
been
made
in
foley
and
ambach,
and
the
court
was
not
concerned
about
pre
emption
in
those
two
cases,
and
i
think
by
virtue
of
the
court's--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
decision
in
ambach
or
foley
or
sugarman
turned
on
federal
pre
emption.
the
court,
when
it
articulated
the
standards
that
the
states
had
broad
power
to
define
their
political
community
and
applied
that
then
to
the
context
of
foley
and
am
dach,
did
not
say
that
they
were
pre
empted
from
that
in
terms
of
citizenship
because
of
the
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
your
honor.
i
would
recommend
that
we
look
more
at
the
exercise
of
the
sovereign
powers
as
a
way
to
draw
the
line
rather
than
just
simply
take
away
completely
the
state's
power
to
require
citizenship.
