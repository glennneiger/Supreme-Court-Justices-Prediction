ms.
mary
s.
burdick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
california
by
enactment
of
one
simple
single
section
of
california
law,
government
code
section
1031(a),
in
one
fell
swoop
has
banned
over
one
and
one
third
million
legally
admitted
resident
aliens
of
california
from
employment
in
more
than
70
different
job
categories,
regardless
of
whether
those
aliens
are
seeking
to
become
citizens.
the
jobs
from
which
aliens
are
excluded
include
deputy
probation
officers,
the
positions
which
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
sought,
as
well
as
such
jobs
as
inspectors
for
specialized
boards,
such
as
the
boards
of
dental
examiners--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--yes,
i
believe
we
are.
the
probation
officers
were
prevented
from
obtaining
employment
by
a
statute
which
sweeps
too
broadly
and
which
does
not
comply
with
the
mandate
of
sugarman
that
a
statute
which
limits
constitutional
rights
if
challenged
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
must
be
narrowly
drawn
and
precisely
crafted
in
light
of
the
state's
interest.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
well,
not
necessarily.
of
course,
in
sugarman,
the
court
struck
down
the
statute
and
said
it
was
not
precisely
crafted
and
narrowly
drawn.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
well,
i
don't
think
that
sugarman
indicated
that
the
court
was
unable
to
decide
which
job
classifications
were
limited
to
citizens.
the
court
said
that,
and
gave
examples
of
jobs
that
the
jobs
were
too
many
and
that
the
statutes
swept
too
broadly,
and
therefore
was
not
precisely
crafted,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here,
a
statute--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--you
would
not
have
to
in
order
to
resolve
the
case
of
the
three
plaintiffs.
however,
this
court
would
be
using
a
prudential
limit
on
standing,
not
a
strict
standing
requirement
to
do
so,
and
that
would
lead
to
the
very
unprudential
result
which
the
county
has
urged
that
we
have
69
more
cases
to
decide
about
the
rest
of
the
statute.
now,
if
we
were
suggesting
that
none
of
the
positions
in
this
statute
could
ever
be
limited
to
citizens,
then
i
would
agree
that
this
is
an
incorrect
vehicle.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
it
is
not.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
well,
the
court
has
clearly
indicated
that
in
some
job
positions
aliens
may
be
excluded,
but
i
think,
yes,
this
is
a
case
where
there
is
an
opportunity
to
draw
the
line,
and
to
establish
some
criteria
so
that
the
cases
do
not
have
to
be
resolved
one
at
a
time
without
any
standards.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
well,
as
the
court
noted
below,
judge
hill
and
the
other
two
judges
on
the
panel
had
been
california
state
trial
judges.
they
were
familiar
with
what
probation
officer
does.
they
said
in
their
opinion
that
they
considered
foley,
they
considered
ambach.
i
have
to
believe
that
they
did
so.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
they
divided
two
to
one.
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
what
is
reflected
in
the
record
is
that
a
first
amended
complaint
was
proposed
to
make
this
a
class
action.
what
is
not
reflected
in
the
record
is
that
the
court
urged
the
parties
to
stipulate
that
it
did
not
have
to
be
a
class
action
because
the
court
believed
it
could
reach
the
overbreadth
issue.
there
is
then
a
stipulation
in
the
record
that
the
parties
would
drop
the
class
allegations
from
the
complaint
and
would
proceed
with
the
action.
however,
the
county
did
agree
to
apply
the
decision
to
all
probation
officers,
deputy
probation
officers
in
the
stipulation,
whether
they
were
named
plaintiffs
or
not.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
pardon?
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
this
is
not
a
class
action,
and
i
am
not
purporting
to--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--well,
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
that
no
one,
no
member
of
what
could
have
been
a
class
could
ever
be
required
to
become
a
citizen
to
get
any
of
the
jobs
here.
all
we
are
asking
the
court
to
say
is
that
this
statute
is
not
precisely
crafted
as
applied
to
anyone.
that
still
leaves
the
legislature
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
go
back
and
do
what
it
could
have
done
before,
and
that
is
examine
each
peace
officer
position
and
require
citizenship
for
those
where
it
feels
it
is
appropriate.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that
is
correct.
when
the
california
attorney
general
a
decade
ago
examined
this
statute,
he
opined
that
it
was
unconstitutional,
examined
the
legislative
history,
and
said
he
could
find
no
reason
for
a
broad
sweeping
citizenship
requirement.
the
citizenship
requirement
is
not
contained
in
a
statute
which
says,
probation
officers
must
be
citizens,
and
a
separate
one
that
says
investigators
for
the
board
of
dental
quality
assurance
must
be
citizens.
what
we
had
was
one
statute
enacted
that
said
peace
officers
must
be
citizens.
the
definition
of
peace
officer
is
contained
scattered
throughout
other
parts
of
california
law,
has
evolved
over
the
years,
and
there
has
never
been
any
attempt
to
attach
a
citizenship
requirement
individually
to
the
job
categories.
the
legislature
acted
with
a
broad
brush.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes,
it
was.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that's
correct.
the
attorney
general
of
california
anticipated
sugarman,
foley,
and
ambach,
in
his
opinion,
indicated
that
under
current
law
even
before
those
decisions
the
statute
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
even
after
the
attorney
general's
opinion
and
this
court's
decisions,
at
least
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
california
has
continued
to
enforce
the
statute.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
the
only
obligation
that
i
know
of
to
involve
the
attorney
general
is
under
this
court's
rules
to
send
him
the
required
notice
of
the
case.
he
does
not
have
any
obligation
that
i
know
of
under
california
law
to
appear.
this
case
offers
an
excellent
opportunity
for
the
court
to
set
some
criteria
and
develop
a
way
to
draw
lines
in
future
cases
where
public
employees
are
excluded
if
they
are
not
citizens.
i
offer
and
suggest
three
criteria
which
may
help
give
some
meaning
to
the
language
of
sugarman,
foley,
and
connelie.
this
language...
these
criteria
can
be
used
to
evaluate
jobs
that
are
policy
implementation
jobs,
non
elective,
non
appointive,
and
i
believe
that
these
will
give
some
substance
to
the
language
of
this
court's
opinions
that
require
that
the
public
be
substantially
affected
by
jobs
which
are
limited
to
citizens,
and
that
those
jobs
lie
at
the
heart
of
representative
government.
my
first
suggestion
is
that
we
inquire
whether
public
employees
have
an
important
public
power
which
puts
them
in
a
position
of
authority
and
control
over
a
substantial
portion
of
the
citizen
population.
my
second
suggested
criteria
is
that
we
ask
if
there
is
any
way
in
which
the
citizen
government
buffers
the
contact
between
the
population
in
general
and
the
public
employee,
either
by
screening
the
clientele
of
the
public
employee
or
by
interposing
some
direct
supervisor.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
the
constituency
of
the
probation
officer
in
california
is
that
portion
of
the
population
which
has
been
arrested
by
the
police--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--well,
i
would
say
that
a
job
which
met
the
first
criteria
would
require
that
all
of...
substantially
all
or
a
significant
portion
of
the
population
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
public
employee,
the
geographical
jurisdiction,
be
subject
to
authority
and
control.
for
example--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--no,
exactly.
that
is
my
point.
i
don't
believe
probation
officers
meet
this
first
criteria.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
have
no
information
and
there
is
no
information
in
the
record
as
to
the
total
number
of
probation
officers.
on
that
first
criteria,
as
you
pointed
out,
the
probation
officer
deals
with
a
very
small
population.
the
amicus
service
employees
union
has
offered
data
which
can
be
found
at
their
footnote
4
and
11
and
the
accompanying
text
that
indicates
that
one
tenth
of
1
percent
of
the
california
population
comes
under
the
jurisdiction
of
a
probation
officer.
my
second
suggested
criteria
was
whether
there
was
a
buffer
between
the
public
and
the
public
employee.
my
third
suggestion
is
that
we
ask
if
the
public
employee
holds
a
position
which
has
some
symbolic
importance
in
the
public
mind
in
terms
of
what
the
public
would
perceive
as
the
meaning
of
the
power
and
authority
of
the
government
to
control
and
to
assimilate
the
general
population.
if
we
apply
these
criteria
to
the
probation
officer
functions,
i
think
we
will
see
that
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
a
probation
officer
on
the
one
hand
and
public
employees
such
as
police
officers
and
teachers
on
the
other.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes,
and
it
is
the
legislature
which
i
would
suggest
is
the
entity
which
is
properly
limited
to
citizens.
it
is
the
legislature
which
would
control
the
authority
of
the
court,
the
court
which
in
turn
would
control
the
authority
of
the
probation
officer.
the
probation
officer
is
very
much
screened
out
from
the
political
process
by
the
time
a
small
portion
of
the
population
comes
under
his
control.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
don't
know
if
that
is
true.
in
this
case,
the
legislature
said
all
peace
officers
shall
be
citizens.
what
they
had
in
mind
at
the
time
they
enacted
that
statute
as
to
what
a
peace
officer
might
be,
i
don't
know,
but
if
it
is
true
that
there
has
been
a
reasoned
legislative
decision
here,
then
there
has
been
a
reasoned
legislative
decision
that
messengers
have
to
be
citizens,
too,
and
i
think
at
some
point
the
court
has
to
go
behind
that
decision
to
see
whether
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
but
when
there
is
a
challenge
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
particularly
when
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
such
as
aliens
is
involved,
this
court
has
required
that
there
be
a
compelling
justification
for
the
classification.
if
i
may
apply
my
criteria
to
the
jobs
performed
by
a
probation
officer,
i
think
we
will
see
the
distinction
between
a
probation
officer
on
one
hand
and
a
teacher
or
a
policeman
on
the
other.
probation
officers,
the
court
found,
act
as
advisors
to
the
court
by
preparing
pre
sentence
and
probation
reports
for
juveniles
and
adults.
the
content
of
that
report
is
factual,
and
the
statute
states
exactly
what
is
to
be
included.
therefore,
there
is
very
little
discretion
in
assembling
the
factual
material
in
the
probation
report.
the
probation
officer,
of
course,
does
make
a
recommendation
as
to
probation,
but
in
california
only
the
judge
can
set
probation,
set
the
terms
and
conditions,
revoke
probation,
or
modify
it.
in
court,
the
probation
officer
does
act
as
an
advisor
to
juveniles
who
do
not
have
legal
counsel.
however,
in
this
capacity,
they
become
less
and
less
like
decision
makers
and
more
like
legal
counsel,
which
this
court,
of
course,
has
held
in
in
re
griffiths
may
not
be
limited
to
citizens.
in
their
supervisory
capacity,
probation
officers
meet
and
counsel
the
population
under
their
control,
which
i
have
indicated
is
very
small.
the
documents
relied
on
by
the
appellants
to
support
their
argument
that
probation
officers
perform
an
important
function
indicate
that
on
the
average
a
probation
officer
can
meet
with
a
probationer
less
than
once
a
month.
therefore--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--in
california
there
is
such
a
requirement,
and
the
criteria
that
i
have
offered
are
for
non
appointive,
non
elective
positions.
i
am
not
sure
they
would
be
generally
applicable.
but
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
case
to
argue
that
judges
could
not
be
required
to
be
citizens.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
don't
know.
mr.
stewart
tells
me
he
is.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
if
you--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--i
think
if
there
were
a
statute
that
said
police--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--i
believe
that
i
would
have
standing
to
raise
that
issue.
however,
for
prudential
reasons,
the
court
might
find
that
i
would
not
have
enough
of
a
stake
in
the
case
and
would
not
be
raising
it
in
the
proper
context,
that
it
would
be
an
inappropriate
case
to
decide
the
full
breadth.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
think
in
this
case,
yes,
we
should
be
able
to
prevail
as
the
three
judge
court
below
found
on
the
issue
that
this
statute
was
not
carefully
crafted
by
the
legislature
in
light
of
the
legislature's
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
the
political
community.
that
would
still
leave
the
california
legislature
free
to
go
back
and
enact
a
narrow
statute
which
applied
only
to
the
categories
this
court
found
appropriately
limited
to
citizens.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
probation
officers
properly
fall
within
the
political
community
and
are
similar
to
police
officers
and
teachers.
i
believe
the
probation
officer
performs
more
one
of
the
common
occupations.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no.
as
i
indicated,
we
could
win
if
this
court
only
ruled
that
probation
officers
cannot
be
required
to
be
citizens.
however,
it
would
then
be
in
the
posture
that
perhaps
69
more
cases
would
be
necessary
to
reach
the
point
that
the
district
court,
the
three
judge
court
had
already
met,
and
that
was
that
the
statute
is
overbroad,
and
a
citizenship
requirement,
if
enacted,
will
have
to
be
done
so
narrowly.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
know
that
it
has
been
argued
in
earlier
cases
that
federal
immigration
law
and
federal
power
pre
empts
the
state
imposition
of
any
citizenship
requirements.
although
that
issue
is
not
directly
addressed
in
foley
and
ambach,
because
of
the
existence
in
foley
and
ambach,
we
have
chosen
not
to
pursue
that
claim
here.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
had
thought
that
the
plaintiffs
in
both
foley
and
ambach
had
indicated
their
willingness
to
sign
the
pre
employment
loyalty
oath.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
ours
are
all
willing,
and
mr.
chavez-salido,
in
fact,
had
his
petition
for
naturalization
pending
when
he
applied
for
employment
and
was
still
denied
employment.
if
i
apply
the
criteria
that
i
have
suggested
to
the
job
of
probation
officer,
i
would
note
that
a
probation
officer
does
not
perform
important
functions
which
put
him
in
a
position
of
power
and
authority
over
a
substantial
portion
of
the
population.
as
i
noted,
they
deal
with
approximately
one
tenth
of
1
percent
of
the
population.
they
have
control
of
that
percentage
of
the
population
only
during
the
period
of
probation,
and
their
contact
during
that
period
is
intermittent.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
the
figures
came
from
the--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--i
took...
the
figures
are
from
footnotes
4
and
11
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
service
employees
union,
and
the
figure
was
23
million
californians
and
23,000
probationers.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
it
does
not.
if
we
compare
then
the
police
officer
and
the
teacher,
we
see
that
a
police
officer
has
authority
and
power
to
intervene
in
the
life
of
any
citizen
during
the
entire
life
of
that
citizen.
a
teacher
has
power
and
authority
over
substantially
all
citizens
for
at
least
ten
to
twelve
years
of
their
lives,
and
for
substantial
periods
of
time
during
those
ten
to
twelve
years.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
can
see
that
public
school
teachers
deal
with
probably
85
to
90
percent
of
the
population.
i
consider
that
a
substantial
enough
proportion
to
meet
my
first
criteria.
it
is
also
true,
of
course,
that
a
policeman
can
only
intervene
with
one
person
at
a
time,
and
that
his
decision
to
do
so
may
eventually
be
found
to
have
been
in
error.
however,
the
policeman
has
the
authority
to
make
the
decision
on
the
spot
in
his
own
discretion
whether
to
intervene
with
any
citizen
at
any
time.
the
supervision
and
the
oversight
of
that
decision
comes
afterwards,
and
then
it
is
by
the
court.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes,
it
does,
but
at
the
moment
of
intervention,
the
police
have
the
exercise
of
their
own
personal
understanding
of
their
job
and
their
obligation
as
their
only
guidance.
there
is
no
direct
supervisor
walking
with
the
policeman
on
a
beat.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
in
california,
a
probation
officer
cannot
alter
or
revoke,
make
any
changes
in
probation
at
all.
he
can
merely
bring
the
issue
before
the
judge,
where
the
judge
makes
that
decision.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes,
he
can
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
change
should
be
made,
but
only
the
court
can
make
that
change.
therefore,
again,
he
acts
as
an
advisor,
bringing
issues
to
the
court,
but
not
as
the
ultimate
decision
maker.
my
second
criteria
was
that
we
look
to
see
if
there
is
some
buffer
between
the
general
population
and
the
public
official,
either
by
the
intervention
of
a
supervisor
or
by
screening
of
the
clientele
of
the
public
officer.
it
is
the
police,
the
judges,
and
the
juries
who
winnow
out
the
general
population
and
find
that
narrow
group
which
should
be
under
the
control
of
a
probation
officer.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
then
the
police,
the
judges,
and
the
juries
who
exercise
the
role
of
government
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
that
they
simply
pass
on
to
the
probation
officer
a
very
small
class
of
people
in
need
of
limited
supervision
under
set
terms
and
conditions
for
a
short
period
of
time.
on
the
other
hand,
as
i
have
already
suggested,
the
police
come
in
direct
contact
with
the
general
public,
and
teachers
come
in
direct
contact
with
all
of
the
general
public.
there
is
no
intervention,
and
there
is
no
supervisor.
my
third
criteria
was
that
there
be
some
symbolic
importance
in
the
job
in
order
to
give
meaning
to
the
context
of
what
we
believe
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
representative
government.
police
and
school
teachers
are
constant,
pervasive
symbols
of
what
it
means
to
be
under
the
control
and
authority
and
the
assimilative
forces
of
our
society.
a
probation
officer
is
an
important
employee,
but
he
is
not
a
symbolic
functionary
of
government.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
well,
he
is
an
advisor
to
and
is
present
in
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
he
rises
to
the
same
importance
in
terms
of
symbolism
as
the
judge
or
the
jury.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
he
certainly
understands
that
the
probation
officer
is
following
the
instructions
of
the
judge,
but
i
don't
think
that
he
has
the
same
reaction
to
the
probation
officer
who
is
an
employee
in
an
office
that
he
would
have
to
the
armed
police
officer
or
to
the
judge
behind
the
bench.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
only
if
their
employing
authority
authorizes
it,
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
and
as
far
as
the
record
reflects,
no
such
authorization
has
been
given
in
los
angeles.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
believe
they
do
not.
in
short,
a
probation
officer,
like
a
teacher
or
a
policeman,
is
an
advisor,
not
a
decision
maker.
he
deals
with
a
very
small,
carefully
screened
portion
of
the
population
for
a
short
period
of
time.
the
three
judge
court
below
comprised
of
former
california
state
trial
judges
with
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
operation
of
the
probation
system
twice
concluded
based
on
the
evidence
presented
to
them
that
probation
officers
do
not
perform
functions
that
fall
within
the
heart
of
a
representative
government.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
don't
know
what
the
appointing
authority
is,
or
whether
they
are
simply
employees
of
the
probation
department.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
have
no
information
that
they
are
patronage
people,
no.
they
have
a
competitive
examination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
