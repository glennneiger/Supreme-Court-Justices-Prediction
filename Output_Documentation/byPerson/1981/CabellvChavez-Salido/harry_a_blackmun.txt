justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
justice
white
has
indicated,
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
joined
in
it
by
justice
brennan,
justice
marshall
and
justice
stevens.
the
appellees
here
are
three,
not
one.
each
of
them
is
an
american
educated,
spanish
speaking
lawful
resident
of
los
angeles
county,
california.
each
of
them
holds
a
college
degree
from
an
american
university
and
one
of
them
holds
a
master's
degree.
seven
years
ago,
each
had
a
modest
aspiration
to
become
a
los
angeles
county
deputy
probation
officer
spanish
speaking.
each
was
willing
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
state
of
california
and
to
the
united
states
government
and
indeed
one
of
them
declared
his
intent
to
become
a
citizen.
by
competitive
examination,
two
of
them
and
possibly
the
third
clearly
demonstrated
their
fitness
for
the
jobs
they
desired.
but
the
appellants
denied
them
those
jobs
solely,
solely
because
they
were
not
united
states
citizens.
the
court
today
concludes
that
the
appellees
exclusion
from
their
chosen
profession
is
what
it
calls
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
community’s
process
of
political
self-definition.
the
court
reaches
this
conclusion
in
my
view
by
misstating
the
standard
of
review
it
has
long
applied
to
alienage
classifications.
it
then
asserts
that
a
lawfully
admitted
permanent
resident
alien
is
disabled
from
serving
as
a
deputy
probation
officer
because
that
job,
says
the
court,
“goes
to
the
heart
of
representative
government.”
in
my
view,
this
decision
rewrites
the
court’s
precedents,
it
ignores
history,
it
defies
common
sense
and
it
reinstates
the
deadening
mantle
of
state
parochialism
in
public
employment.
since
the
case
called
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
in
1886,
95
years
ago,
this
court
has
recognized
and
honored
the
right
of
a
lawfully
admitted
permanent
resident
alien
to
work
for
living
in
the
common
occupations
of
the
community.
in
sugarman
against
dougall
decided
in
1973,
the
court
by
an
eight-to-one
vote
expressly
refused
to
exempt
public
employment
positions
from
that
general
rule.
in
that
case,
we
struck
down
as
facially
inconsistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
a
new
york
statute
that
excluded
lawfully
admitted
aliens
from
all
state
civil
service
jobs
offered
on
the
basis
of
competitive
examinations.
sugarman
directed
that
permanent
resident
aliens
may
not
be
barred
as
a
class
from
the
common
public
occupations
of
the
community.
since
that
case,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
in
each
case
where
the
state
chooses
to
discriminate
against
permanent
resident
aliens
the
governmental
interest
claim
to
justify
the
discrimination
is
to
be
carefully
examined
in
order
to
determine
whether
that
interest
is
legitimate
and
whether
it
is
substantial,
an
inquiry
must
be
made
whether
the
means
adopted
to
achieve
the
goal
are
necessary
and
precisely
drawn.
alienage
classifications
by
a
state
that
do
not
withstand
this
stringent
examination
cannot
stand.
and
applying
that
stringent
standard
here,
i
would
hold
that
on
its
face
the
california
statue
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
when
appellees
first
sought
their
jobs,
the
peace
office
category
in
california
encompassed
more
than
70
public
occupations
including
such
apparently
unrelated
positions
as
toll
takers
and
cemetery
sextons
and
fishing
game
wardens,
and
furniture
and
bedding
inspectors,
and
voluntary
fire
wardens
and
the
like.
and
to
this
day,
the
legislature
has
offered
no
reason
why
such
divergent
classes
of
public
jobs
were
gathered
under
the
peace
officer
umbrella.
the
history
of
the
statute
suggest
the
answer.
before
1961,
california
did
not
require
any
of
its
peace
officers
to
be
citizens.
indeed
in
1851,
it
granted
only
sherifs
and
policemen
and
marshals
and
constables
statutory
peace
officer
status,
and
for
more
than
a
century
the
state
did
not
require
even
those
four
occupations
to
be
citizens.
in
1961,
without
stating
any
rationale
as
the
court
below
called
it
in
one
fell
swoop,
the
legislature
passed
the
statute
in
question
which
applied
the
mandatory
citizen
requirement
to
all
of
the
positions
on
the
list.
it
made
no
attempt
to
include
in
a
peace
officer
list
all
positions
for
which
citizenship
arguably
might
be
relevant
or
to
exclude
all
positions
for
plainly
it
would
be
irrelevant.
nine
years
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
california’s
own
attorney
general
stated
that
in
our
opinion
the
citizenship
requirement
can
no
longer
validly
be
imposed.
and
today
even
without
a
glance
at
this
history,
the
court
reverses
the
reasoning
that
the
district
court
improperly
applied
the
standard
of
review
far
stricter
than
that
approved
in
sugarman
and
later
cases.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
originally
understood,
the
sugarman
exception
was
exceedingly
narrow.
less
demanding
scrutiny
was
deemed
appropriate
only
for
statutes
deriving
from
a
state's
historical
power
to
exclude
aliens
from
participation
in
its
dramatic
democratic
political
institutions
or
its
constitutional
responsibility
for
the
establishment
and
operation
of
its
government.
california's
inflexible
exclusion
of
aliens
from
deputy
probation
officer
is
inconsistent
with
its
tolerance
of
aliens
and
other
rules
integral
to
the
criminal
justice
system.
california
counties
apparently
may
appoint
aliens
to
the
position
of
chief
juvenile
probation
officer
or
chief
adult
probation
officer
if
the
best
interest
of
the
county
will
be
served,
and
furthermore
even
before
this
court
decided
in
re
griffiths
where
we
held
that
citizenship
could
not
be
imposed
as
a
barrier
to
the
practice
of
law.
the
california
court
had
held
that
lawfully
resident
aliens
may
not
be
barred
constitutionally
from
the
practice
of
law
and
nor
are
they
barred
from
becoming
california
superior
court
judges,
or
supreme
court
justices.
and
thus
a
criminal
defendant
in
california
may
be
represented
at
trial
and
on
appeal
by
an
alien
attorney
may
have
this
case
tried
before
an
alien
judge
and
appealed
to
an
alien
justice
and
then
have
his
probations
supervised
by
a
county
probation
officer
headed
by
an
alien.
i
find
constitutionally
absurd
the
court
suggestion
that
the
same
defendant
cannot
be
entrusted
to
the
supervised
discretion
of
a
resident
alien
deputy
probation
officer.
in
the
court's
own
words,
a
statutory
scheme
that
tolerates
such
a
result
is
sufficiently
haphazard
as
to
belie
the
state's
claim
that
is
only
attempting
to
ensure
that
an
important
function
of
government
be
in
the
hands
of
those
having
the
fundamental
legal
bond
of
citizenship.
in
the
end,
the
state
has
identified
no
characteristic
of
permanent
resident
aliens
as
a
class
which
disenables
them
from
performing
the
job
of
deputy
probation
officer.
the
state
does
not
dispute
that
these
appellees
possessed
the
qualifications
and
educational
background
to
perform
the
duty
the
job
entails.
it
advances
no
rational
reason
why
these
appellees
native
spanish
speakers
would
graduate
academic
degrees
are
not
superbly
qualified
to
act
as
probation
officers
for
spanish
speaking
probationers,
some
of
whom
themselves
may
not
be
citizens.
i
can
only
conclude
that
california's
exclusion
of
these
appellees
from
the
position
of
deputy
probation
officer
stems
solely
from
state
parochialism
and
hostility
toward
foreigners
who
have
come
to
this
country
lawfully
and
who
reside
here
legally.
i
find
it
ironic
that
the
court
invokes
the
principle
of
democratic
self-government
to
exclude
from
the
law
enforcement
process
individuals
who
have
not
only
resided
here
lawfully,
but
who
now
desire
merely
to
help
the
state
enforce
its
law.
in
theory,
we
welcome
these
lawfully
resident
aliens
to
our
midst.
but
despite
that
theory,
the
state
denies
and
this
court
now
approves
the
right
to
earn
a
living
in
a
public
job
that
has
little
to
do
with
the
formulation
of
policy
and
political
self-definition.
as
i've
stated
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
stevens
joined
in
this
dissent.
