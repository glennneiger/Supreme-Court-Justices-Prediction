justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
case
80-990,
cabell
against
chavez-salido
is
here
on
appeal
for
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california.
the
case
arose
because
under
california
law,
residents
are
disqualified
from
being
peace
officers.
petitioners
sought
to
become
a
probation
officer
and
brought
this
case
when
he
was
rejected
because
he
was
not
a
citizen.
the
district
court
held
that
the
united
states
constitution
required
california
to
hire
aliens
as
well
citizens
to
enforce
its
laws.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
now
reversed.
under
our
prior
cases,
the
state
may
require
citizenship
as
a
prerequisite
to
holding
state
elective
office
as
well
as
important
non-elective
positions
in
the
executive,
legislative,
and
judicial
branches.
we
have
held
the
school
teachers
are
in
this
category.
we
now
hold
that
non-citizens
maybe
excluded
form
those
positions,
the
occupants
of
which
symbolize
and
exercise
the
sovereignâ€™s
coercive
powers
over
its
citizens
and
others
within
its
jurisdiction.
probation
officers
are
in
this
category.
we
have
filed
an
opinion
to
this
effect.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
he
will
announce.
