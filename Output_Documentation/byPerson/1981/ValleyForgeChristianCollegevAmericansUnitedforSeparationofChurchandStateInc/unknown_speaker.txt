unknown
speaker
did
the
third
circuit
make
any
effort
to
distinguish
frothingham
against
mellon?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
third
circuit
opinion
would
extend
so
far
that
if
b
is
the
subject
of
a
wrongful
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment,
a
could
complain
about
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
include
a
challenge,
do
you
think,
to
the
recently
approved
sale
of
some
aircraft
to
saudi
arabia
if
they
didn't
like
the
foreign
policy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hodgson,
i
expect
you
may
already
have
covered
it,
but
i
didn't
catch
it.
unknown
speaker
was
this
an
outright
transfer
to
your
client?
unknown
speaker
the
property
that
you
received.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this
is
a
fee
simple
transfer,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
rental
arrangement
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hodgson,
are
there
any
citizens
who
in
your
view
would
have
standing
to
file
a
suit
to
challenge
this
action--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
about
people
living
in
the
near
vicinity?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
still
have
the
tax
spending
problem?
you
would
concede,
though--
unknown
speaker
--that
they
could
bring
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
we
say
either
in
schlesinger
or
in
reservists
that
the
fact
that
there
is
no
one
that
has
standing
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
we
must
create
standing
for
someone
to
sue?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hodgson,
let
me
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question
if
i
may.
the
adjoining
landowner
standing--
unknown
speaker
--on
review
would
depend
on
some
kind
of
adverse...
not
the
mere
fact
they
were
an
adjoining
landowner.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
the
other
applicant
for
the
property,
i
can
see
the
theory
there.
of
course,
if
the
other
applicant
were
also
a
religious
institution,
i
suppose
they
wouldn't
have
standing
there.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
theory
of
the
claim
is
that
all
religious
institutions
are
disqualified--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
put
the
question
just
a
little
differently.
instead
of
it
being
a
property
disposition,
supposing
the
secretary
of
hew
just
decided
to
give
your
client
a
million
dollars.
unknown
speaker
would
anybody
have
standing
to
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
if
it
were
a
gift
of
funds,
because
it
is
the
spending
power,
that
there
would
be
standing.
unknown
speaker
economically,
it
is
hard
to
see
much
difference
between
the
two.
i
understand
the
theory,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
can
see
on
the
merits
that
is
all
relevant,
but
just
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
individual
who
objects
to
the
transaction,
the
standing
of
the
person,
it
seems
somewhat
hard
to
differentiate
between
the
two
other
than
you
say,
well,
one
is
a
spending
power
and
the
other
is
a
property
disposition.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
if
they
are
indistinguishable,
that
flast
ought
to
be
overruled.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
in
the
million
dollar
case
the
government
specified
that,
please
use
the
million
dollars
to
buy
a
piece
of
property
and
use
it
precisely
as
it
is
described
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
that
makes
it
even
closer,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
you
interrupted.
unknown
speaker
on
your
adjoining
landowner
case--
unknown
speaker
--why
would
the
adjoining
landowner,
just
because
his
drainage
system
is
being
damaged,
have
any
standing
to
attack
the
transfer
on
the
first
amendment
ground?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
an
injury,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
some
cases
to
the
contrary,
too.
but
that
is
your
theory,
anyway--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
adjoining
landowner.
unknown
speaker
are
there
not
some
cases
in
which,
in
effect,
cash
grants
made
to
religious
colleges
have
been
sustained?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
question
on
the
merits,
not
standing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
wouldn't
those
same
arguments
have
called
for
a
different
result
in
the
flast
case?
and
aren't
you
really
saying,
then,
that
flast
was
incorrectly
decided?
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
mr.
solicitor
general--
unknown
speaker
--americans
united,
i
take
it,
would
have
had
standing
had
rather
than
a
transfer
of
property
there
had
been
a
transfer
of
$577,000
of
cash,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
this
property
transfer
sort
of
a
congressional
act?
unknown
speaker
the
congressional
statute.
unknown
speaker
really,
the
only
distinction
here
is
that
we
have
real
property
rather
than
cash.
unknown
speaker
under
doremus,
both
would
have
come
out
the
same
way,
would
they
not?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
would
prohibit
congress
from
enacting
a
statute
that
no
property
and
no
money
would
be
transferred
or
granted
or
given
to
a
religiously
controlled
college
or
school,
and
thus
cut
off
any
power
in
the
executive
branch
to
make
such
a
transfer
as
was
made
here?
unknown
speaker
from
receiving
it
for
nothing.
unknown
speaker
that,
of
course,
would
mean,
then,
that
that
would
be
a
modification
in
effect
of
the
decision
of
this
court,
i
think,
in
the
tilton
case--
unknown
speaker
--they
couldn't
make
grants
to
catholic
colleges
as
were
involved
there.
unknown
speaker
does
that
relate
to...
i
assume
that
relates
to
your
argument--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
the
political
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
am
not
sure
that
argument
is
controlling,
because
the
phenomenon
of
government
support
for
private
schools
has
become
more
important
in
recent
years,
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
done
historically
may
not
be
a
total
answer,
but
suppose
this
case
had
arisen
in
a
state
court,
supposing
a
state
government
did
exactly
what
the
federal
government
did
here,
and
a
person
who
was
not
even
a
taxpayer
sought
to
challenge
it,
and
the
state
court
said,
yes,
we
will
entertain
the
challenge,
would
we
have
the
right
to
review
such
a
decision?
unknown
speaker
that
is
doremus,
i
guess,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall
doremus,
the
state
court
said
there
was
standing.
unknown
speaker
new
jersey
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
if
you
recall
in
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
flast
against
cohen
he
draws
the
distinction
between
hofeldian
and
non-hofeldian
cases--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
says
that
if
congress
authorized
a
non-hofeldian
standing,
it
would
be
all
right.
do
you
disagree
with
that
view?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
said
either
in
reservists
or
schlesinger
that
the
fact
that
there
is
no
one
who
has
standing
does
not
confer
standing
on
someone?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
nonetheless
a
constitutional
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
establishment
clause
in
article
i,
say,
from
the
right
to
be
free
from
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
in
article
iv
and
the
right
to
counsel
in
article
v
or
vi,
or
the
right
to
fair
trial,
that
sort
of
thing?
isn't
it
true
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
would
be
affirmed,
the
court
would,
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests,
have
to
be
grading
various
provisions
of
the
constitution
as
to
their
fundamentality?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
true,
then,
of
any
taxpayer
suit,
that
no...
we
all
pay
taxes
for
many
things
that
we
object
to
and
perhaps
wouldn't
vote
for
if
we
were
legislators,
but
that
we
can't
show
any
discrete
impact
on
our
own
tax
bill
for
it.
would
you
say
everybody
had
standing
to
attack
those
sort
of
expenditures
if
they
claimed
they
violated
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
all
constitutional
provisions
core
value?
unknown
speaker
but
in
barnett,
there
was
actual
standing
in
the
sense
that
a
particular
school
child
was
forced
to
do
something
that
he
objected
to
on
constitutional
grounds
that
he
shouldn't
have
to
do.
unknown
speaker
would
you
distinguish
between
the
free
exercise
clause
and
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
your
theory,
then,
on
your
theory
members
of
jehovah's
witnesses
and
other
religious
people
who
sincerely
are
opposed
to
all
forms
of
warfare
and
defense,
military
establishment,
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
levying
of
a
tax
on
them
to
the
extent
that
tax
was
used
to
buy
tanks
and
airplanes
and
other
things.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
we
are
concerned
here
with
now,
we
are
talking
about
standing,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
we
are
not
getting
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general,
whose
response
was
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
forbid
transfers
of
this
kind
and
transfers,
grants
to
colleges
on
religious
grounds?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
follow
that.
if
congress
simply
said,
we
are
not
going
to
give
any
money,
we
are
not
going
to
transfer
any
property
to
a
religiously
sponsored
school
or
college,
do
you
seriously
question
their
authority
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
we
are
just
discussing
it
in
the
abstract.
they
just
say
no
money,
no
money
can
be
given
to
any
religious
school,
no
property
can
be
transferred
except
for
full
value
to
any
religious
school.
do
you
question
the
right
of
congress
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
that
avoids
all
your
problems
of
the
establishment
clause,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
government
giving
in
the
tilton
case?
unknown
speaker
which
chapel
was
formerly
used
by
the
government.
unknown
speaker
with
nobody's
objection.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
too
worried
about
what
you
permit.
i
am
worried
about
what
the
constitution
permits.
unknown
speaker
how
about
chaplains
in
the
senate
and
house?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boothby,
if
the
court
were
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
would
you
agree
that
really
any
person
could
come
in
then
as
a
plaintiff
and
raise
any
establishment
clause
question,
without
any
practical
limitation?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
that
be
the
danger
or
concern
we
would
have
if
we
were
to
approve
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
framers
of
our
constitution
really
reject
the
idea
of
a
roving
commission
to
challenge
actions
of
the
government,
and
didn't
the
framers
really
contemplate
the
case
in
controversy
requirement,
which
in
essence
embodies
standing,
and
isn't
this
opinion
a
significant
departure
from
that
basic
concept?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
injury
in
fact?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
the
sort
of
injury
in
fact
that
barlows
or
associated
processing
was
concerned
with?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boothby,
along
that
same
line,
can
you
argue
your
case
on
standing
without
getting
into
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
your
standing
without
the
merits,
because
you
say
that
unless
this
is
a
church
school,
you
have
no
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
is
a
school
that
is
completely
non-sectarian,
do
you
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
then
you
have
to
get
to
the
merits.
you
would
rather
call
it
facts,
but
i
prefer
to
call
it
merits.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
get
to
it.
unknown
speaker
if
this
was
a
non-sectarian
institution,
you
would
have
no
case.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
have
any
standing,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
have
any
standing.
unknown
speaker
so
that
any
person
in
the
country
can
file
a
complaint
in
any
federal
district
court
saying
that
the
transfer
was
to
a
pervasively
sectarian
institution,
and
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
his
allegation.
unknown
speaker
but
it
must
nonetheless
be
considered.
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory,
could
an
anti-war
group
object
to
the
selling
of
these
awacs?
unknown
speaker
they
are
against
war.
would
they
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
when.
i
said,
have
standing.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
that
their
religion
says
we
are
against
war,
and
we
object
to
you
selling
awacs
to
anybody.
would
they
have
standing?
and
when
you
get
through
with
that,
you
can
ask
about
declaring
war.
there
is
no
limit
to
where
you
could
go.
unknown
speaker
was
the
standing
point
involved
in
that?
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
standing
now.
i
would
like
to
leave
it
with
standing.
i
have
great
problems
with
where
your
line
is
drawn.
i
can
allege
that
my
religion
is
against
taxing,
so
i
want
to
stop
paying
my
income
tax.
i
don't
have
standing
for
that.
unknown
speaker
and
they
could
plead
forma
pauperis
and
it
wouldn't
cost
them
a
nickel
to
do
it.
right?
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
draw
a
line
in
my
mind
between
standing
in
the
merits,
and
i
can
do
it
in
place
of
your
argument.
because
your
argument
needs
merits
to
get
to
standing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
booth,
you've
referred
two
or
three
times
to
the
free
exercise
clause.
i
had
thought
the
third
circuit's
opinion
was
limited
to
establishment
clause.
unknown
speaker
but
you,
which
is
your
view,
that
it
should
be
limited
to
establishment
clause.
unknown
speaker
and
the
specific
allegations
about
establishment.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
have
allegations.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
here,
mr.
boothby,
if
they
had
sold
it
for
$500,000?
unknown
speaker
what
principle
would
be
involved
if
they
sold
it
for
$500,000?
unknown
speaker
yes.
less
than
value.
unknown
speaker
less
than
value.
unknown
speaker
then
what
if
they
put
it
up
for
auction,
limiting
the
bidders
to
colleges
and
universities,
and
this
institution
was
the
low
bidder,
and
the
bid
was
$100,000,
way
below
value.
would
you
have
standing
first?
let's
stay
with
standing.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
illustrate
the
practical
side
of
this
situation,
that
you
must
leave
the
running
of
the
government
to
the
people
who
were
elected
to
run
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boothby,
i
have
been
looking
at
your
complaint.
what
provision
of
the
complaint...
i
am
looking
at
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix...
contains
your
allegation
of
injury
in
fact?
the
joint
appendix--
unknown
speaker
--page
10.
is
that
the
complaint
that
is
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
before
we--
unknown
speaker
--before
we
leave
that,
could
you
identify
in
the
complaint
the
injury
in
fact
language
upon
which
you
rely?
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
the
complaint,
what
about
paragraph
2,
which
is
the
one
that
speaks
of
the
injury
to
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
each
individual
member
would
be
deprived
of
the
fair
and
constitutional
use
of
his
or
her
tax
dollar.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
allegation
in
here
other
than
that,
which
seems
to
relate
to
status
as
taxpayers,
that
indicates
an
injury
in
fact
to
these
particular
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
is
that
document
before
us,
mr.
boothby?
unknown
speaker
the
record
here?
unknown
speaker
is
the
record
here?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
in
this
building.
was
it
filed
with
the
clerk?
that's
all.
i
am
sure
it
had
to
be.
unknown
speaker
united
states
versus
carlolene
products?
unknown
speaker
that
is
c-a-r-o-l-e-n-e?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
doremus
they
were.
unknown
speaker
but
flast
cited
doremus
with
approval.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
certainly
was
a
substantial
change
in
view
of
standing
in
the
third
circuit's
opinion
as
compared
to
this
court's
cases
in
warth
and
simon
versus
east
kentucky.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
just
read
out
article
iii,
then?
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
question
that
occurred
to
me
during
the
argument.
someone
referred
to
the
case
we
had
earlier
this
week
that
also
came
from
pennsylvania,
involving
a
religious
group,
some
people
who
felt
very
deeply
that
paying
a
certain
tax
would
be
a
sin
against
their
religion.
supposing
someone
living
next
door
to
this
institution
felt
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
live
in
a
community
in
which
the
government
established
a
religion
in
which
they
had
no
belief,
or
they
just
thought
it
would
be
a
sin
even
to
live
where
the
government
established
religion.
would
that
person
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
somebody
said
it
is
a
sin
to
live
in
a
country
in
which
the
federal
government
does
this
sort
of
thing.
would
that
still...
would
you
think
that
would
be
standing?
unknown
speaker
a
deeply
held
belief.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
injury
to
him
is
continuing
to
live
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
these
people,
instead
of
stressing
their
taxpayer
status,
had
just
said
they
believe
very
deeply
that
it
will
offend
their
conscience
to
have
their
government
do
this.
is
that
really
different?
unknown
speaker
it
offends
their
conscience.
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
matter
of
conscience.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
