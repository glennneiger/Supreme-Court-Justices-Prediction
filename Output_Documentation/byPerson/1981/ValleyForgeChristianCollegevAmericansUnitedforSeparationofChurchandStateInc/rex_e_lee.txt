mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
agree
with
mr.
hodgson
that
there
probably
are
other
plaintiffs
who
could
bring
the
suit
in
this
case,
but
it
is
correct,
as
he
also
pointed
out,
that
this
court
in
schlesinger
said
that
the
lack
of
a
better
plaintiff
does
not
mean
that
this
plaintiff
has
standing,
and
indeed
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
in
the
companion
case,
united
states
versus
richardson,
this
court
went
one
step
further,
and
said
that
the
fact
that
there
is
not
a
plaintiff
who
has
standing
in
the
traditional
article
iii
sense
is
a
good
indication
that
it
is
the
kind
of
case
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
political
branches
of
government
rather
than
to
the
judiciary.
it
is
quite
clear
that
since
these
plaintiffs
allege
a
harm
that
cannot
be
differentiated
from
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
other
american
citizens,
and
since
they
do
not
fit
the
flast
versus
cohen
standards
for
taxpayer
standing,
the
only
way
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
sustained
is
to
uphold
the
rationale
of
that
court,
which
was
that
the
establishment
clause
creates
in
each
citizen
a
personal
constitutional
right
to
a
government
that
does
not
establish
religion.
there
are
two
basic
theories
on
the
basis
of
which
that
could
be
accomplished.
one
is
the
one
that
mr.
hodgson
suggested,
which
is
that
any
citizen
has
a
right
to
enforce
any
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
frankly,
it
would
be
difficult
if
the
right
were
limited
to
the
establishment
clause
to
distinguish
it
from
many
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
but
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
been
to
limit
it
to
establishment
clause
to
distinguish
it
from
many
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
but
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
been
to
limit
it
to
establishment
clauses.
as
i
say,
it
has
been
difficult
to
do
that,
but
that
appears
to
have
been
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
would
urge
that
even
that
approach
represents
neither
good
law
nor
good
constitutional
policy
for
several
reasons.
one
is
that
it
would
violate
this
court's
consistent
teaching
which
gives
more
deference
to
the
judicial
article
of
the
constitution,
article
iii,
that
the
fundamental
aspect
of
standing
is
that
it
focuses
on
the
party
seeking
to
get
its
complaint
before
a
federal
court,
and
not
on
the
issues
that
he
wishes
to
have
adjudicated.
more
specifically,
requiring
the
precise
overruling
of
doremus
versus
board
of
education,
which
was
an
establishment
clause
case
brought
by
a
citizen
and
dismissed
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
standing.
doremus
has
been
cited
with
approval
both
in
flast
and
also
schlesinger.
perhaps
most
important
of
all,
the
rulings
of
this
court
requiring
first
that
the
plaintiff
be
affected
more
narrowly
than
members
of
the
total
populace,
and
second,
that
standing
focused
on
the
plaintiff
rather
than
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
that
the
plaintiff
is
bringing
lies
right
at
the
heart
of
basic
constitutional
principles.
the
feature
of
our
constitutional
system
that
distinguishes
courts
from
the
other
two
branches
of
government
is
that
courts
perform
their
law
interpretive
function,
including
declarations
of
constitutionality,
only
in
cases
or
controversies
and
interest
of
the
kind
that
these
plaintiffs
are
pressing
in
this
case,
an
interest
in
seeing
that
a
particular
philosophy
of
government
prevailed,
can
be
carried
to
the
elected
branches,
and
those
branches
are
free
to
entertain
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
agree
with
what
mr.
hodgson
said
in
that
respect.
flast
can
be
distinguished.
at
least
flast
presents
only
a...
if
not
a
principle,
at
least
a
practical
departure
from
the
general
proposition
that
there
is
no
general
authority
in
private
citizens
performing
the
function
of
attorney
general,
because
of
its
limitation
to
congressional
action
and
taxing
and
spending.
i
would
shed
no
tears
if
flast
were
to
be
overruled.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
under
flast,
if
done
by
congress.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
under
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
this
is
an
executive
branch
transfer
pursuant
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--so
if
you
had
a
congressional
action
pursuant
to
the
taxing
and
spending
clause,
then
your
statement
is
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
under
doremus,
both
would
have
come
out
the
same
way,
and
you
really
are
at
a
flast
kind
of
crossroads.
you
either
maintain
that
holding
that
is
not
entirely
principled
but
at
least
practical
and
workable.
a
principle
which
this
court
has
cautioned
on
at
least
two
occasions
represented
only
a
slight
departure
from
frothingham
versus
mellon,
or
if
you
say
that
there
is
no
practical
distinction,
economic
distinction
between
a
conveyance
of
money
on
the
one
hand
and
a
conveyance
of
property
on
the
other
hand,
then
you
can
forget
about
flast
versus
cohen,
you
can
forget
about
the
taxpayer
standing.
you
don't
need
it
any
more,
because
if
citizens
have
standing,
then
any
property
owner
also
or
any
taxpayer
will
also
have
standing.
and
that
really
brings
me
to
the
fundamental
reason
that
that
would
be
a
bad
idea,
to
decide
the
case
that
way.
in
contrast
to
the
political
branches
of
government,
which
are
perfectly
free
under
the
constitution
to
entertain
any
advocacy
for
a
particular
form
of
government,
philosophy
of
government
that
is
put
to
them,
the
tradition
ever
since
marbury
versus
madison
has
been
that
courts
decide
only
those
issues
as
they
arise
in
actual
lawsuits
brought
by
persons
who
are
injured
in
fact,
and
on
at
least
seven
separate
occasions,
reaching
all
the
way
back
to
the
early
parts
of
this
century,
this
court
has
said
that
that
injury
in
fact
means
an
injury
more
specific
than
the
effect
that
is
felt
by
the
populace
as
a
whole,
and
in
our
separation
of
powers,
check
and
balance
constitutional
system,
the
most
effective
check
on
judicial
power
is
the
case
or
controversy
limitation.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
two
possible
bases
for
distinguishing
this
case
or
for
distinguishing
establishment
clause
cases
from
other
cases.
one
was
that
the
establishment
clause
does
have
or
is
a
guarantor
of
individual
liberties,
and
it
is
true
beyond
doubt
that
it
can
be,
but
far
from
being
an
argument
in
support
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
it
is
squarely
against
it
for
this
reason,
that
in
those
instances
where
you
do
have
that
kind
of
individualized
harm,
then
that
gives
you
a
plaintiff
with
traditional
article
iii
standing,
and
where
you
don't
have
it,
then
what
you
have
is,
as
this
court
said
in
richardson,
the
kind
of
case
that
by
definition
ought
to
be
handled
by
the
article
iii...
ought
to
be
handled
by
the
article
i
or
the
article
ii
branches.
the
second
proposition
that
was
set
forth
by
judge
rosen,
whose
vote
was
essential
to
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
was
this
matter
that
has
already
been
discussed,
is
there
a
better
plaintiff,
and
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
both
richardson
and
schlesinger
that
that
is
not
a
relevant
concern.
to
the
extent
it
is
relevant,
it
cuts
the
other
way.
finally,
setting
aside
establishment
clause
cases
as
being
something
of
a
special
nature...
would
give...
would
unduly
degrade
the
judicial
article
of
the
constitution,
which
should
have
an
independent
life
of
its
own,
because
to
the
already
complex
and
difficult
issues
that
surround
standing,
we
would
be
visiting
another
layer
of
complexity,
a
layer
of
complexity
that
would
incorporate
into
the
article
iii
inquiry
the
question
of
what
is
an
establishment
of
religion,
presumably
including
the
three-part
test
that
this
court
has
struggled
so
mightily
with
over
the
past
decade.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
be
reluctant,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
give
a
categorical
answer
to
that
until
i
have
thought
it
through
a
little.
my
immediate
temptation
is
to
say
no,
and
yet
if
there
were
a
categorical
disqualification
of
religion
as
religion
from...
solely
because
they
were
religious
groups--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--receiving
it
for
nothing,
then
clearly
where
there
was
not
adequate
compensation,
then
congress
would--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh,
yes.
oh,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
that
brings
up--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--indeed
it
does.
indeed
it
does.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
indeed
it
does.
and
it
bears
out
also
the
point
that
this
court
has
stressed
on
a
number
of
occasions,
stated
first
by
justice
holmes
a
good
part
of
a
century
ago,
that
there
are
also,
in
addition
to
protections
that
are
built
into
the
judicial
system,
but
there
are
also
protections
in
congress.
the
fear
has
been,
well,
what
if
you
simply
gave
away
the
war
college,
or
gave
away
the
naval
academy.
in
the
first
place,
there
probably
would
be
someone
who
could
challenge
that,
but
even
if
there
weren't,
our
system
has
survived
for
two
centuries
without
that
ever
happening,
and
the
most
immediately
responsive
branches
to
that
kind
of
thing
ever
happening
would
be
the
branches
that
are
going
to
have
to
respond
to
the
pressures
of
the
people
who
cast
the
votes,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
in
warth
versus
seldin.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
guess
it
is.
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
that
is
doremus.
the
decision
of,
i
believe
it
was
a
new
york
court--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
certainly
defer
to
your
expertise
on
that
matter,
your
honor.
let
me
just
say
in
conclusion
that
i
can
conceive
of
a
constitutional
system
which
gave
to
any
citizen
the
right
to
accede
to
the
courts
for
the
resolution
of
any
problem
of
public
importance.
something
like
that,
not
that
kind
of...
it
would
not
be,
in
my
opinion,
the
best
kind
of
system,
because
i
believe
that
our
separation
of
powers,
checks
and
balances
system
is
a
better
one.
something
like
that
was
proposed
with
the
council
of
revision,
which
was
expressly
rejected
by
the
constitutional
convention.
the
underlying
premise
of
marbury
versus
madison,
the
reason
for
judicial
review
is
that
judicial
review
is
necessary
to
the
performance
by
the
article
iii
branch
of
its
function
of
deciding
real
lawsuits
between
real
parties,
and
this
court
clarified
a
half-century
ago
in
chicago
grand
trunk
railway
versus
wellman
that
the
corollary
to
that
marbury
versus
madison
principle
is
also
true,
that
courts
perform
that
function
only
in
those
circumstances
where
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
perform
their
article
iii
case
or
controversy
decisional
process.
perhaps
the
most
revealing
statement
on
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
of
the
plaintiff
setumbrini,
who
said,
i
represent
all
american
citizens,
and
indeed
he
does.
that
is
the
kind
of
claim
that
under
our
constitutional
system
and
under
traditional
practice
under
this
court's
precedents
must
be
taken
to
the
political
branches
of
government,
and
not
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
have
serious
problems
with
it,
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
subsequent
holdings,
probably
best
spelled
out
in
warth
versus
seldin,
that
there
are
constitutional
minima,
that
one
of
those
constitutional
minima
is
injury
in
fact,
so
that
the
real
issue
becomes,
is
the
richardson-schlesinger
type
ruling,
the
citizen
standing,
rooted
in
injury
in
fact,
and
in
my
view
it
is.
that
is
the
only
part
of
justice
harlan's
opinion
that
i
disagree
with.
thank
you.
