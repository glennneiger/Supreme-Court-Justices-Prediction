justice
william
h.
rehnquist
pursuant
to
its
authority
under
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution,
congress
enacted
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949
in
part
to
provide
an
economical
and
efficient
system
for
the
disposal
of
surplus
government
property.
the
act
authorizes
the
secretary
of
education
to
convey
surplus
real
property
to
non-profit
education
institution
and
to
reduce
the
selling
price
by
an
amount
that
reflects
the
benefit
gained
by
the
united
states
from
the
transferee's
use
of
the
property.
in
this
case
which
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit,
the
secretary
conveyed
surplus
property
former
--
formerly
used
as
a
military
hospital
to
petitioner,
a
non-profit
church
related
college
primarily
devoted
to
training
men
and
women
for
religious
ministry.
respondents,
an
organization
devoted
to
--
separation
of
church
and
state
and
four
of
its
employees
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
to
rescind
the
conveyance
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
respondents
maintained
that
the
conveyance
deprived
them
of
the
fair
and
constitutional
use
of
their
tax
dollars.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
respondents
lack
standing
as
taxpayers
under
our
decision
in
flast
against
cohen
and
had
failed
to
allege
any
actual
injury
that
would
allow
them
to
challenge
the
conveyance.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
the
district
court.
although
the
court
was
inclined
to
agree,
the
respondents
lack
standing
as
taxpayers,
it
held
they
had
standing
as
citizens
claiming
injury
to
their
“shared
individuated
right
to
a
government
that
shall
make
no
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion.”
we
now
reverse
this
judgment
and
hold
that
respondents
have
failed
to
demonstrate
standing
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
case
or
controversy
requirement
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
they
cannot
claim
standing
as
taxpayers
under
our
decision
in
flast
because
the
transfer
they
challenge
is
not
a
congressional
action
taken
under
the
taxing
and
spending
clause
of
article
i,
section
8.
it
is
instead
an
executive
branch
action
authorized
by
congress
under
the
property
clause.
we
also
hold
the
respondents
cannot
claim
standing
as
citizens.
article
iii
requires
an
allegation
of
tangible
personal
injury,
which
is
not
satisfied
simply
by
the
claim
that
the
government
has
violated
the
constitution.
a
plaintiff
must
also
allege
some
personal
consequence
as
a
result
of
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
conduct
and
the
respondents
have
not
--
have
not
done
simply
by
claiming
a
sincere
and
fervent
interest
in
the
separation
of
church
and
state.
to
the
extent,
respondents
invite
the
court
to
create
an
exception
to
article
iii
for
cases
arising
under
the
establishment
clause,
we
declined
that
invitation.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
