mr.
lee
boothby
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
this
is
the
first
opportunity
which
this
court
has
had
to
address
the
question
of
standing
as
it
impacts
on
the
establishment
clause
since
the
landmark
decision
which
had
been
discussed
here
of
flast
versus
cohen
some
13
years
ago.
this
case
also
presents
the
first
establishment
challenge
to
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
suggested
in
this
particular
case
that
there
is
the
probability
that
no
one...
that
if
these
plaintiffs
do
not
have
standing,
no
one
perhaps
has
standing
to
challenge,
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
no
standing,
that
that
particular
act,
that
particular
act
of
congress
would
be
immune
from
the
establishment
clause
challenge,
no
matter
how
gross
the
violation
might
be.
mr.
lee
boothby
it
says
that
it
is
an
indication
that
it
does
not,
that
perhaps
it
should
be
handled
by
the
political
branch.
however,
i
think
in
that
particular
case
the
suggestion
of
then
solicitor
general
robert
bork
as
he
argued
that
case
before
this
court
is
instructive,
because
he
in
that
particular
case
argued
that
the
plaintiff
interest
in
cia
funding
hardly
rose
to
the
dignity
of
a
constitutional
right
involved
in
flast
because,
as
he
said,
first
amendment
freedoms
need
breathing
space
to
survive,
and
there
is
a
broader
concept
of
standing
appropriate
in
that
particular
area.
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
in
richardson.
in
the
brief
in
richardson,
the
solicitor
general
argued
that
the
case
did
not
involve
core
values
involved
in
flast;
it
involved
the
statement
and
account
provision
not
central
to
the
constitution,
and
thus
the
circumstances
rendered
doubtful
the
occurrence
of
substantial
adverse
interest.
mr.
lee
boothby
it
was
a
constitutional
provision,
but
it
was
dealing
with
article
i
rather
than
with
the
establishment
clause,
and
i
think
that
brings
us
to
really
the
very
heart
of
this
particular
case.
the
question
is,
is
the
ultimate
protection
of
values
enshrined
in
the
establishment
clause
to
reside
with
the
judicial
system,
or
the
judicial
branch
of
government,
or
are
there
certain
establishment
clause
values
that
perhaps
the
political
branch
has
the
ultimate
authority
in?
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
that
the
establishment
clause
is
different
from
even
any
other
first
amendment
right
for
this
reason.
it
is
an
amorphous
type
right.
all
other
first
amendment
rights,
right
to
free
speech,
free
exercise,
to
publish,
have
two
aspects.
one
is
protection
from
certain
government
action,
and
the
other
one
is
protection
for,
to
do
certain
specific
things.
that
is
not
true
necessarily
with
the
establishment
clause,
because
basically
that
right
is
a
right
to
be
free
from
certain
governmental
actions,
and
may
not
directly
impact
specifically
uniquely
on
any
particular
person,
and
i
think
that
presents
a
separate,
specific
problem
that
must
be
addressed
in
a
practical
way.
mr.
lee
boothby
no,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction,
which
was
in
fact
pointed
out
in
richardson
and
in
schlesinger,
where
a
distinction
was
made
between
certain
core
value
rights
given
by
the
constitution
and
the
type
of
political
situation
that
was
involved
in
both
the
decisions
of
schlesinger
and
richardson.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
perhaps
there
are
certain
core
values
which
have
to
be
protected
in
different
ways,
and
i
think
a
lot
of
what
we
are
discussing
today
deals
with
the
prudential
concerns
of
the
court,
the
concerns
of
self-restraint,
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
standing
from
the
constitutional
standpoint
in
this
particular
case,
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
now
are
prudential
concerns,
and
the
fact
that
if
one
accepts...
if
one
does
accept
the
view,
which
i
suggest
is
an
appropriate
view
under
west
virginia
versus
barnett,
that
certain
rights
must
not
be
left
in
the
political
process,
then
prudentially
we
have
to
look
to
the
court
enforcement
of
those
rights.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
may
be
true,
but
it
gets
back
to
the
basic
question
as
to
whether
establishment
rights
should
be
subject
to
the
political
process,
subject
to
the
vote
of
the
majority,
and
i
suggest
that
that
basic
core
value
right
under
the
theory
of
madison
and
jefferson
when
they
suggested
the
religion
clauses
be
included
in
the
bill
of
rights
was
to
commit
that
to
the
judiciary
for
protection.
mr.
lee
boothby
mr.
chief
justice,
both
of
those
are
co-guarantors
of
religious
liberty.
the
difference
is
that
the
free
exercise
right
always
impacts
on
a
specific
individual
or
group
of
people,
so
prudentially
you
have
a
person
with
standing
without
much
difficulty.
when
we
are
discussing
the
problem
with
reference
to
the
establishment
clause,
we
have
a
much
different
situation.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
perhaps
they
have
standing.
the
question
then
would
be
raised
as
to
what
the
compelling
state
interest
might
be,
and
how--
mr.
lee
boothby
--yes,
the
question
in
that
case--
mr.
lee
boothby
--under
the
free
exercise
clause,
the
question
would
be,
does
that
particular
governmental
action
impact
or
burden
their
religious
freedom,
and
if
they
could
demonstrate
under
the
free
exercise
clause
that
it
does,
then
they
would
have
standing,
i
think,
to
bring
the
matter
before
the
court
as
to
whether
what
the
decision
would
be
would
be
based
upon
the
balancing
test.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
would
think
that
they
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
the
question
is
as
to
whether
they
should
be
the
final
authority
to
determine
whether
their
own
actions
are
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause,
which
i
suggest
has
been
committed
to
the
judiciary.
mr.
lee
boothby
are
we
discussing
it
now
in
the
context
of
the
free
exercise
clause?
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
congress--
mr.
lee
boothby
--it
would
avoid
it
if
the
congress
in
fact
did
that.
the
question
is,
we
have
here
a
31-year
history
where
that
has
not
been
the
situation,
where
the
benefit
allowance
has
always
been
granted
to
the
extent
of
95
to
100
percent,
and
the
question
is
whether
anyone
can
ever
challenge
what
seems
to
us
to
be
indistinguishable,
the
question
of
whether
you
are
giving
cash,
giving
an
appropriation
of
dollars,
or
whether
you
are
giving
bricks
and
mortar,
and
whether
you
are
giving
personal
property,
it
seems
indistinguishable.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
in
the
tilton
case,
it
was...
it
involved
different
items,
but
one
of
the
items
which
was
specifically
addressed
by
the
court
was
with
reference
to
buildings
which
20
years...
there
was
a
provision
there
that
at
the
end
of
20
years,
the
restrictions
were
at
an
end,
and
this
court
invalidated
a
specific
part
of
it
dealing
with
a
facility
that
might
be
turned
into
a
chapel
or
something
for
a
religious
purpose.
here,
in
this
particular
case,
we
don't
have
to
wait
20
years
down
the
road
to
find
some
speculation
as
to
whether
it
is
going
to
be
used
for
a
chapel.
there
was
a
specific
building
which
was
in
the
nature
of
a
chapel
that
was
given
to
the...
to
the
college
and
used
directly
and
immediately
for
a
chapel,
so
what
we
have
here
in
part
was
the
government
giving
a
chapel
to
the
college
to
be
used
for
pervasively
sectarian
instruction,
which
i
can
see
no
difference
between
this
and
the
decision
in
tilton.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
is
correct,
but
of
course
we
have
distinguished
under
the
free
exercise
clause
prisons
and
chapels
and
chaplains
in
the
armed
services,
because
of
the
restrictions
that
are
placed
upon
servicemen
and
upon
prisoners,
and
as
a
means
to
accommodate
because
of
the
restrictions
that
government
has
imposed,
we
have
permitted
the
furnishing
of
chapels
in
those
instances,
but--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
believe
that
that
has
been
the
theory
under
the
chaplaincy
and
for
chapels
in
the
armed
services.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
has,
of
course,
been
a
long
tradition
there,
and
perhaps
under
the
decisions
dealing
with
the
ceremonial
decisions,
those
type
of
decisions,
that
would
be
a
basis
for
sustaining
that.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
the
court...
they
always
impose
certain
prudential
considerations.
as
this
court
has
said
as
recently
as
last
year,
in
the
geraghty
case,
that
the
court
should
view
these
cases
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
lee
boothby
to
the
type
of
cases
that
directly
impact
on
specific
individuals,
i
see
no
particular
problem
with
those
requirements.
in
addition,
i
would
suggest
that
we
are
not
dealing
nor
should
we
deal
with
a
generalized
grievance
or
one
where
we
are
asking
merely
for
an
advisory
opinion.
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
where
it
is
a
plaintiff
not
attacking
generally
an
act
of
congress,
but
is
attacking
a
specific
transfer
of
property,
and
so
we
have
a
factual
context
in
which
this
case
is
brought,
and
i
would
suggest
that
to
the
extent
that
the
injury
that
we
are
concerned
with
is
an
amorphous
type
of
situation
where
it
is
a
step
down
the
way
towards
the
establishment
of
religion
than
citizens
should
be.
let
me
suggest
this,
because
i
think
we
are
going
to
the
question
of
the
locus
of
the
injury.
does
it
make
any
difference,
for
instance,
whether
the
citizen
who
feels
aggrieved
lives
next
door
to
valley
forge
christian
college?
it
really
doesn't.
now,
it
does
make
a
difference
if
we
are
talking
about
a
public
school
engaging
in
sectarian
religious
education
within
that
school.
yes,
the
people
within
that
community
have
a
more
direct
impact.
but
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
we
are
talking
about
a
transfer
of
property,
government
property,
to
be
used
for
pervasively
sectarian
teaching,
and
i
think
the
locus
of
it
is
unimportant.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
don't
believe
it
to
be
a
significant
departure.
as
i
understand
the
article
iii
requirements
of
standing,
that
is,
that
there
must
be
injury
in
fact,
we
are
talking
about
a
case
presented
in
a
manner
where
it
is
an
historical
setting
for
judicial
relief.
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
issues
are
presented
by
adversaries
in
a
factual
context,
and
i
believe
that
is
met
in
this
particular
type
of
case.
mr.
lee
boothby
injury
in
fact
in
this
particular
case
is
that
type
of
injury
which
is
experienced
by
many
people
in
this
country,
but
the
fact
that
government
is
not
being
neutral
and
establishing
an
environment
which
prevents
a
government
operating
with
a
separation
of
church
and
state.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
of
course,
those
were
concerned
with
economic
problems.
mr.
lee
boothby
but
in
data
processing
the
court
specifically
indicated
that
what
it
said
in
that
case
also
applied
to
spiritual
values,
and
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
spiritual
value,
not
an
economic
value.
mr.
lee
boothby
yes.
i
don't
think
one
needs
to
get
into--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
don't
think
one--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
think
that
in
order
to
reach
the
standing
question,
as
the
court
said
in
flast,
to
find
out
if
there
is
a
nexus
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
injury,
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
in
that
fashion,
but
you
do
not
need
to
cross
the
threshold
and
decide
the
merits
of
the
case.
you
do
not
need
to
determine
whether
in
fact
this
is
a
pervasively
sectarian
institution,
merely
look
to
see
whether
there
is
an
allegation--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
think
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
there
is
an
allegation
raised
by
the
plaintiff
that
there
is
a
pervasively
sectarian
institution
involved,
but
you
need
not
decide
that
fact.
mr.
lee
boothby
to
that
extent.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
there
would
not
be
the
claim
of
establishment
violation.
mr.
lee
boothby
you
would
not,
and
that
would
probably
be
a
political
question
at
that
point.
mr.
lee
boothby
that's
true.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
i
think
one
of
the
ways
of
handling
that
particular
problem
is
that
summary
judgment
method
of
handling
it,
perhaps,
but
i
think
if
there
is
a--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
think...
yes.
mr.
lee
boothby
no,
i
think
that
comes
under--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
don't--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that--
mr.
lee
boothby
--unless
they
are
making
out
a
free
exercise
type
of
argument,
it
certainly--
mr.
lee
boothby
--well,
of
course,
to
some
extent
that
was
the
issue
that
was
argued
here
on
monday
with
reference
to
the
social
security
tax,
and
they
were
raising
the
question,
but
they
did
have
standing.
mr.
lee
boothby
no,
but
they--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
think
then
you
reach
the
question
of
whether
it
is
a
burden
on
the
free
exercise
rights
of
those
people.
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
that
issue,
and
then
the
question
of
sincerity.
now,
perhaps
they
would
have
standing
to
raise
the
question.
mr.
lee
boothby
basically,
sherbert
versus
verner
dealt
with
somebody
objecting
to
the
impact
of
a
particular
statute,
state
statute.
the
question
was
not
standing.
the
question
that
was
disposed
of
was
the
question
of
the
use
of
the
balancing
test
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
compelling
state
interest
to
override
the
free
exercise
rights
mr.
lee
boothby
well
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
the
facts
briefly
as
what
class
said
in
order
to
determine
whether
there's
a
nexus
between
the
individual's
injury
and
the
constitutional
provision.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
boothby
yes.
it
is
only
an
establishment
question
here,
as
i
indicated,
i
think
the
establishment
clause
presents
unique
problems
that
are
not
experienced
in
the
free
exercise
clause
because
the
nature.
establishment
problems
are
created,
as
chief
justice
in
lemon
indicated,
when
the
first
step
is
taken
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion.
and
so,
in
order
to
protect
against
that
very
first
step,
it
is
necessary
to
be
able
to
raise
the
question
in
a
judicial
form
when
there
is
a
case
presented
in
a
historical
way
with
specific
facts
asking
for
specific
relief
directed
against
the...
what
is
perceived
to
be
the
wrong.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
that
you
need
to
say
that--
mr.
lee
boothby
--you
are
basing
it
upon
an
establishment
claim,
yes.
i
think
there
might
be
an
illustration
that
would
demonstrate
perhaps
why
the
establishment
question
raises
separate
questions,
and
let
me
suggest,
what
if
congress
would
enact
a
law
that
would
say,
we
are
officially
recognized
in
a
certain
church
as
the
official
church,
baptist
church,
unitarian
church,
presbyterian,
or
whatever
it
might
be,
but
we
provide
no
sanctions
and
we
grant
no
money,
we
make
no
appropriation.
the
question
is,
would
anyone
have
a
right
to
come
before
a
court
and
ask
that
that
particular
congressional
act
be
voided,
or
is
that
something
specifically
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
congress
and
go
through
the
political
process
in
order
to
accomplish,
and
i
submit
that
those
are
the
type
of
problems
as
it
is
particularly
highlighted
in
this
case,
where
you
must
have,
you
need
to
have
access
to
the
courts
to
prevent
violations
of
the
establishment
clause
from
occurring.
mr.
lee
boothby
first
of
all,
this
really
involves
$1,300,000
when
you
involve
the
personal
property,
but
i
think
the
principle
involved
is
important
whether
we
are
talking
about
$500,000
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
$100,
the
principle
is.
now,
obviously--
mr.
lee
boothby
--oh,
if
they
sold
it
and
received
$500,000?
mr.
lee
boothby
less
than
the
value?
mr.
lee
boothby
then
you
would
be
perhaps...
i
think
perhaps
there
would
be
standing,
but
the
question
would
be
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
there
was
an
actual
gift
made
by
the
government
without
consideration,
whether
it
was
in
fact
a
contribution
or
a
donation
to
some
extent.
mr.
lee
boothby
to
the
extent
that
you
could
make
out
a
claim
of
violation,
i
would
say
perhaps
you
would
have
standing.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
that
is
normally
true,
except
when
you
have
this
type
of
situation
where
we
are
talking
about
a
violation
of
such
a
basic
core
value,
and
i
don't
believe
that
one
should
have
to
go
to
the
political
processes
in
order
to
have
that
redressed.
one
other...
perhaps
one
other
matter
which
goes
to
this
particular
problem
is
the
fact
that
one
of
the
things
that
indicates
that
this
is
a
case
in
controversy,
and
this
is
a
case
for
judicial
relief,
is,
i
would
seriously
question
whether
the
executive
or
the
legislative
would
have
power
to
provide
the
relief
which
is
requested.
we
are
requesting
that
a
transfer
which
has
been
made
be
voided.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
for
the
legislative
branch
or
the
executive
branch
to
perform
that.
that
is
the
type
of
relief
which
is
uniquely
within
the
power
of
a
court
to
provide.
so,
i
don't
think
that
the
executive
or
legislative
branch
can
provide
that
type
of
relief.
mr.
lee
boothby
yes.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
is
the
complaint.
however,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the--
mr.
lee
boothby
--pardon?
mr.
lee
boothby
paragraph
12
is
the
one
that
deals
with
the
claimed
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
i
would
like
to,
however,
add
to
that--
mr.
lee
boothby
--yes.
that
describes...
that
describes
the
organizational
plaintiff
in
this
particular
case,
and
indicates
the
fact
that
these
particular
people
that
are
members
of
the
organization
are
taxpayer
members
affected
by
the
use
of
the
property.
mr.
lee
boothby
that's
correct.
mr.
lee
boothby
not
in
the
complaint,
your
honor.
i
might
make
reference
to
page
13
of
the
brief
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
college,
where
they
specifically
stated,
which
is
correct,
that
respondents
were
given
the
opportunity
through
discovery
to
particularize
the
allegations
of
the
amended
complaint
in
connection
with
the
district
court's
ruling
of
the
college's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
depositions
and
answers
to
interrogatories
were
considered.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
injuries
that
we
are
talking
about
were
particularized
in
those
depositions,
and
specifically
pages
28
through...
27
through
30
of
the
plaintiff
gunn's
deposition,
where
he
described
in
a
very
particularized
way
those
type
of
injuries
with
which
he
was
concerned,
where,
on
page
28,
he
stated,
"when
the
government
establishes
religion,
that
is,
contributes
to
the
establishment
of
religion,
my
religious
liberty
is
being
violated.
"
"it
affects
me
in
that
my
freedom
of
conscience
is
being
violated
and
my
religious
liberty
is
being
trampled
upon
because
the
government
is
taking...
is
fostering
and
promoting
religion.
"
"it
is
not
the
business
of
government
to
do
this.
"
"the
government
is
to
remain
neutral.
"
then,
"when
the
government
gives
over
public
lands
that
belong
to
the
public,
and
public
buildings
and
personal
property,
then
it
is
promoting
one
religion
over
against
all
other
religions.
"
and
further,
"when
the
government
takes
sides
on
matters
of
religion,
it
is
taking
a
side
against
my
religion,
and
therefore
is
inhibiting
me
and
violating
my
freedom
of
conscience
by
forcing
me
as
a
taxpayer
and
as
a
citizen
to
give
support
to
someone
else's
religion.
"
mr.
lee
boothby
the
document
is
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
part
of
the
record,
and
as
i
have
indicated,
was
considered
by
the
district
court
at
the
time
of
the
dismissal
of
the
case.
mr.
lee
boothby
pardon?
mr.
lee
boothby
i
would
assume
that
the
record--
mr.
lee
boothby
--that
is
my
understanding.
and
as
i
say,
that...
there
are
other...
there
are
several
other
similar
statements
in
other
depositions,
and
i
won't
go
in
great
detail,
but
i
might
make
reference
to
plaintiff
doerr,
on
pages

pages

on

and

all
indicate
what
we
would

would
be
the
particularized
injuries
complained
of
in
this
particular
case.

suggested
that
exacting
judicial
scrutiny
of
state
action
is
appropriate
when
state
action
violates
the
bill
of
rights
or
frustrates
the
political
process.
i
would
suggest
that
we
can't
have
exacting
judicial
scrutiny
when
there
is
an
absolute
denial
of
all
judicial
scrutiny,
and
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
highlighted
in
this
particular
case
is
that
no
one
perhaps
might
have
standing
if
these
particular
plaintiffs
do
not
have
standing.
it
has
been
suggested
that
perhaps
someone
close
by
in
the
area
might
have
some
standing
about
a
drain
or
something,
but
those
people
are
not
going
to
be
specifically
concerned
about
raising
establishment
issues
except
to
some
extent
that
it
might
assist
their
case.
also,
it
was
suggested
that
there
might
be
another
applicant
for
the
property,
and
again
i
would
suggest
that
that
concern
is
more
economic
than
one
dealing
with
the
values
enshrined
in
the
establishment
clause,
and
it
would
seem
that
if
we
are
trying
to
find
the
plaintiff
to
raise
the
establishment
issue
in
the
most
specific
way
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
issue,
we
should
be
looking
at
the
plaintiff
that
can
best
present
the
establishment
clause
challenge
from
the
standpoint
of
their
own
specific
injury,
the
injury
being
a
violation
of
their
rights
under
the
establishment
clause.
in
warth
versus
seldin,
it
was
stated
that
the
standing
question
requires
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
constitutional
or
statutory
provisions
on
which
a
claim
rests
properly
can
be
understood
as
granting
persons
in
the
plaintiff's
position
judicial
relief,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
establishment
clause
does
do
just
that.
it
grants
to
a
specific
individual
the
right
to
judicial
relief.
i
question
whether
it
is
ever
tolerable
to
expect
the
establishment
clause
by
the
doctrine
of
standing
to
be
divided
into
enforceable
and
non-enforceable
establishment
clause
rights,
and
i
suggest
also
that
the
precious
aspects
of
religious
freedom
should
never
be
placed
upon
the
barter
block
of
legislative
debate,
political
trade-offs
or
compromise.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
in
doremus
it
was.
i
think
that
flast
went
a
long
way
in
resolving
the
problem
there.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
is
correct,
but
it
certainly
was
a
departure
from
what
was
said
by
the
court
in
doremus.
i
think
that
there
has
been
also
a
substantial
change
in
the
way
the
question
of
standing
has
been
viewed
since
doremus,
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
in
its
most
recent
expressions--
mr.
lee
boothby
--i
think
that
this
court
has
never
really
had
to
face
this
issue
in
this
context
before,
and
it
did
face
it
to
some
degree
in
flast,
but
it
did
not
need
to
go
further
than
to
find
some
taxpayer
standing.
this
is
a
situation
which
is
somewhat
different,
but
i
would
suggest
that
as
the
establishment
clause
was
deemed
to
be
a
limitation
of
article
i,
section
8,
it
is
equally
a
limitation
on
article
iv
provision
granting
to
the
congress
the
power
to
dispose
of
property.
i
don't
see
any
distinction.
mr.
lee
boothby
no,
i
think
that
there
must
be
a
case
in
controversy.
i
don't
think
you
can
merely
ask
for
an
advisory
opinion,
but
when
you
have
real
parties
litigating
real
factual
issues
and
asking
for
specific
relief,
not
merely
an
adjudication
of
a
congressional
act,
but
asking
for
specific
judicial
relief,
i
think
that
the
case
in
controversy
requirements
of
article
iii
have
been
met,
particularly
where
there
is
an
allegation
of
injury
in
fact
of
the
character
involved
in
the
establishment
clause
itself.
your
honor,
i
believe
i
have
a
minute
or
two.
if
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
will
do
my
best
to
attempt
to
answer
them.
otherwise,
i
am
prepared
to
submit
the
case.
