mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
my
client's
petition
to
this
court
raises
for
review
the
question
of
whether
or
not
taxpayers
who
are
unable
to
meet
the
criteria
of
flast
against
cohen
and
any
other
article
iii
decision
of
this
court
will
nonetheless
be
able
to
challenge
the
transfer
of
federal
surplus
property.
this,
in
short,
is
an
article
iii
case.
it
is
not
an
establishment
clause
case.
the
constitutional
and
statutory
context
is
outlined
by
article
iv,
section
3,
clause
2
of
the
constitution,
which
is
called
the
property
clause.
under
that
clause
congress
has
the
power
to
dispose
of
territory
or
other
property
belonging
to
the
united
states.
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949
was
enacted
pursuant
to
that
power,
and
creates
a
comprehensive
program
for
federal
property
disposal,
particularly
property
which
is
surplus,
that
is,
property
no
longer
needed
by
the
united
states.
the
statute
confers
upon
agencies
of
the
executive
branch
a
variety
of
options
for
property
disposal,
including
the
sale
or
lease
to
health
or
educational
institutions.
sale
may
be
for
cash,
but
the
act
requires
that
the
secretary
consider
any
public
benefit
accruing
to
the
united
states
as
a
result
of
the
sale,
and
an
educational
institution
may
be
entitled
to
a
reduction
in
the
purchase
price
computed
on
the
basis
of
benefits
which
may
accrue
to
the
united
states
for
the
use
of
the
property
by
that
institution.
the
regulations
refer
to
that
reduction
as
a
public
benefit
allowance.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
the
32-year
history
of
this
act,
a
program
over
which
congress
has
given
exclusive
if
not
plenary
power
under
article
iv
is
subject
to
attack
and
the
intervention
of
the
judicial
process.
this
particular
transfer,
the
valley
forge
general
hospital,
originally
about
a
181
acre
tract
slightly
outside
the
city
of
philadelphia,
was
acquired
by
the
government
in
1942.
it
served
the
military
as
a
hospital
facility
for
nearly
30
years.
in
1974,
by
order
of
the
secretary
of
defense,
the
facility
was
closed.
the
secretary
states
reasons
of
declining
work
force
and
economy
as
the
reasons
for
the
closure
of
the
facility.
as
is
required
by
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act,
the
following
four
steps
took
place.
first,
the
military
departments
determined
that
it
was
excess
to
their
needs
and
the
needs
of
the
united
states
coast
guard.
secondly,
congressional
clearance
was
sought
and
obtained
from
the
armed
services
committee
of
both
houses.
thirdly,
the
general
services
administration,
after
notifying
all
other
federal
agencies
and
all
other
branches
of
the
government
of
the
availability
of
this
facility,
reported
that
there
was
no
need,
and
it
was
declared
under
the
statute
surplus
to
the
needs
of
the
federal
government.
finally,
it
was
assigned
to
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
for
disposition
to
a
health
or
educational
institution.
my
client,
valley
forge
christian
college,
applied
for
a
portion
of
the
tract,
and
was
ultimately
selected
to
receive
77
acres
and
some
personal
property.
the
value
of
the
surplus
facility
was
$577,000.
the
government,
in
connection
with
this
sale,
allowed
a
100
percent
public
benefit
allowance
based
in
part
upon
my
client's
promises
and
representations
to
continue
the
broadening
of
its
offerings
in
the
arts
and
humanities
and
otherwise
strengthen
its
academic
position,
conferring
benefits
upon
members
of
the
public.
in
august
of
1976,
a
deed
was
executed
by
the
government
transferring
the
real
estate
to
my
client.
the
deed
included
restrictive
covenants
which
forbid
the
college
from
utilizing
the
property
for
anything
other
than
educational
purposes
and
some
other
restrictions,
and
included
in
the
government
the
right
at
any
time
within
30
years
to
revert
the
title
back
to
the
department
in
the
event
of
a
breach
of
these
conditions.
in
the
fall
of
1976,
as
a
result
of
a
news
release
that
was
issued
following
this
transfer,
americans
united,
the
organization,
and
four
paid
employees
on
its
executive
staff
filed
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
seeking
a
recision
of
the
transaction,
thereby
effectively
ousting
my
client
from
its
college
campus.
after
limited
pretrial
discovery,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint,
finding
that
none
of
the
plaintiffs
could
comply
with
the
standing
criteria
of
flast
against
cohen,
and
further
holding
that
their
complaint
alleged
no
more
than
a
generalized
grievance
about
the
conduct
of
government.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
unanimously
agreed
with
the
lower
court's
finding
that
these
taxpayers
could
not
meet
the
flast
criteria,
but
nevertheless
reversed.
the
majority
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
launched
an
unsupportable
test
for
establishment
clause
standing,
wherein
standing
is
now
to
be
predicated
upon
the
violation
of
the
shared,
individuated
right
that
each
citizen
has
to
a
government
that
obeys
its
constitution.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
not
really,
your
honor.
the
third
circuit
spent
most
of
its
time
on
flast
against
cohen
and
tried
to
steer
its
reasoning
around
flast.
i
think
it
finally
concluded
that
under
flast,
or
this
court
was
bound
by
limitations
on
the
pleadings
when
it
decided
flast.
had
the
fact
situation
been
presented
to
this
court
that
was
before
the
third
circuit,
namely
the
presence
of
citizen
separationists,
the
flast
court
would
have
decided
that
differently.
that
was
the
general
approach.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
agree
that
the
words
of
the
opinion
appear
limited
to
the
establishment
clause,
but
i
think
that
the
potential
reach
of
this
decision,
the
implication
of
a
personal
right
in
every
citizen
to
enforce
the
constitution
at
his
or
her
demand
is
limitless.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
i
would
say
that
i
could
envision
a
plaintiff,
if
this
is
your
honor's
question,
making
that
challenge.
i
am
a
little
lost
to
think
of
what
provision
of
the
constitution
but
i
could
see
that
easily.
i
think
it
is
limitless.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
outright.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
well,
yes,
it
was
fee
simple
transfer,
but
it
had
conditions,
restrictive
conditions,
including
a
reverter
clause.
the
college
is--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
the
college
is
obliged
to
live
up
to
the
representations
made
in
its
application
for
the
property
for
a
period
of
30
years,
and
any
time
during
that
30-year
period
if
the
government
determines
that
there
is
non-compliance
with
those
representations,
it
may
enter
and
revert
the
title.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
the
law
of
this
country
on
standing
until
the
radical
reconstruction
of
this
standing
test
by
the
third
circuit
related
to
the
finding
of
a
personal
stake
or
injury
in
fact.
that
has
been
the
construction
of
article
iii
by
this
court.
as
to
taxpayer
standing,
flast
has
been
the
first
and,
until
that
opinion,
the
last
word.
as
your
honors
will
recall,
flast
allowed
a
taxpayer
to
challenge
on
establishment
clause
grounds
a
congressional
exercise
of
the
taxing
and
spending
power
of
the
constitution,
the
article
i,
section
8
powers.
it
was
specifically
limited
by
the
text
of
the
opinion
to
those
circumstances
and
to
that
type
of
a
statute.
this
court
has
strongly
and
consistently
resisted
any
effort
to
expand
flast
on
taxpayer
basis
beyond
article
i,
section
8,
the
taxing
and
spending
power.
specifically,
in
schlesinger,
this
court
rejected
a
taxpayer's
challenge
that
was
brought
pursuant
to
the
incompatibility
clause
under
article
i.
the
same
could
be
said
of
richardson
wherein
executive
action
was
challenged
by
a
taxpayer
pursuant
to
article
i,
section
9,
clause
7.
here,
of
course,
these
taxpayers
seek
still
a
further
run
around
flast
and
say
that
the
property
clause,
article
iv,
and
congressional
action
taken
pursuant
to
that
clause
should
become
the
basis
for
standing.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--oh,
excuse
me.
although
i
would
call
them
persons
rather
than
citizens
to
get
away
from
the
concept
of
citizen
standing,
yes,
i
can
imagine
a
number
of
article
iii
type
injuries
which
would
give
a
plaintiff
standing
to
sue.
for
example,
an
applicant
for
the
property
that
was
denied
the
application.
in
other
words,
if
valley
forge
had
been
preferred
over
some
other
applicant,
that
individual
could
bring
an
action
to
challenge--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--adjoining
landowners,
i
think,
if
they
could
establish
an
injury
that
was
causally
related
to
their
estate,
could
equally
bring
a
lawsuit.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--i
would
say
that
you
don't
have
the
taxing
and
spending
power
because
that
is
article
iii
injury.
it
is
injury
in
fact.
there
is
aggrievement
independent
of
flast,
and
you
only
need
flast
and
taxpayer
standing
where
there
is
an
article
i
challenge.
and
of
course
any
category
of
article
iii
plaintiff
would
have
the
right
to
raise
the
establishment
clause
question.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
it
said
it
is
not
a
reason
for
granting
standing.
i
think
it
addressed
this
very
question,
and
your
honor,
it
was
both
in
richardson
and
schlesinger.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
no,
no,
that
adjoining
landowner
would
have
to
show,
for
example,
that
the
utilization
of
the
property
would
impact
in
some
manner
on
his
rights
as
an
adjoining
owner.
maybe
a
sewage
system
would
be
changed
in
some
fashion.
i
can't--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--no,
i
think
they
would.
i
guess
the
question
then
would
be
whether
under...
on
the
merits,
whether
the
successful
applicant
was
or
was
not
a
disqualified
institution
under
article
i.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
well,
of
course,
that
is
not
what...
at
least
not
how
this
court
has
interpreted
article...
or
the
establishment
clause.
pervasively
sectarian
seems
to
have
been
disqualified,
but
not
all
religious
institutions.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
well,
i
assume
that
a
gift
of
funds--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--would
be
an
action,
a
congressional
action,
i
assume,
executive
action
taken
pursuant
to
the
taxing
and
spending
power.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
and
so
a
taxpayer
most
assuredly
would
have
standing
to
challenge.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes,
and
flast
so
holds.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
world
of
difference
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
set
forth,
notably
in
warth
against
seldin
and
simon
versus
kentucky
welfare
rights
organization,
because
you
have
the
theory,
you
have
attenuated
injury
when
you
have
a
plaintiff
of
this
kind.
if
you
were
to
say
$577,000
worth
of
real
estate
is
the
equivalent
of
$577,000
worth
of
cash,
and
you
are
saying
the
government
should
have
taken
the
cash,
for
example,
instead
of
the
real
estate,
that
assumes
an
awful
lot.
first
of
all,
the
government
would
have
to
maintain
the
property,
and
the
government's
brief
says
it
was
$250,000
a
year.
secondly,
the
college
clearly
indicated
on
the
record
it
was
going
to
move.
it
may
well
have
moved
to
a
different
location,
used
tax...
federal
assistance
funds,
such
as
those
in
tilton
versus
richardson,
to
support
a
building.
it
would
have
raised
a
building
fund.
contributors
would
have
taken
tax
deductions.
that
is
all
cash.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
well,
if
you
are
saying
that
conceptually
this
is
a
difficult
area
of
the
law,
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
i
have
great
reservations
about
flast,
justice
white.
i
know
that
other
members
of
the
court
have
expressed
those
reservations.
i
find
it
difficult--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--it
is
still
the
use
of
the
taxing
and
spending
power.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
a
little.
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
that
these
are
the
sort
of
grants
that
this
court
has
considered
in
tilton,
hunt
versus
mcnair,
lemon,
where
you
have
the
actual
transfer
of
funds
and
then
the
utilization
by
the
institution--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
well,
assuming
that
there
is
an
article
iii
injury,
i
just--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--okay.
if
there
is
an
article
iii
injury,
this
court
has
said
in
sierra
club
and
elsewhere
that
once
an
individual
has
standing
to
sue,
he
may
assert
basically
any
claim,
including
the
public
interest,
including
a
citizen's
interest.
you
said
that
in
sierra
and
other
cases.
so
that
once
the
threshold
is
crossed
by
an
article
iii
plaintiff,
he
has
a
veritable
panoply
of
issues
that
he
can
raise
and
argue,
and
which
the
court
can--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
tilton,
roemer,
hunt
against
mcnair,
are
all
college
education
grant
cases,
where
money,
pursuant
to
the
taxing
and
spending
power,
is
appropriated
and
delivered
to
the
institution
for
the
use...
for
secular
uses,
not
for
sectarian
uses.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
it
goes
to
the
merits,
your
honor.
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
standing.
the
line
of
attack
generally
taken
by
the
americans
united
in
this
case
really
relates
to
the
merits,
claims
that
we
are
pervasively
sectarian,
claims
that
we
seek
the
perpetuation
of
formalism
to
this
court,
claims
that
this
entire
transaction
is
a
sham,
that
the
statute
is
really
an
effort
to
bootleg
federal
surplus
property
around
the
establishment
clause
and
into
the
hands
of
a
disqualified,
religiously
sponsored
institution
are
all
the
kinds
of
claims
which
go
to
the
merits,
and
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
the
standing
inquiry
focuses
on
the
litigant,
not
the
issues
which
he
seeks
to
have
litigated,
and
in
warth,
very
directly,
standing
in
no
way
depends
on
the
merits.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
you
seem
to
be
positing
the
existence
of
a
free
exercise
injury
in
fact,
article
iii,
and
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
i
think
it
alleges--
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
--it
alleges
an
injury
in
fact,
an
alleged
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
i
can't
help
but
think
of
it
on
the
merits,
thinking
particularly
of
reynolds
versus
united
states,
the
polygamy
case,
that
believing
as
a
matter
of
religious
conscience
that
the
practice
of
bigamy
was
appropriate,
but
of
course
that
goes
to
the
merits,
but
i
think
that
the
allegations
that
you
fashion,
while
they
appear
at
least
to
be
frivolous,
might
fall
within
the
free
exercise.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
that
it
offends
their
conscience?
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
c.
clark
hodgson,
jr.
i
think
it
is
very
different.
their
conscience
as
citizens
of
the
united
states.
because
matters
of
