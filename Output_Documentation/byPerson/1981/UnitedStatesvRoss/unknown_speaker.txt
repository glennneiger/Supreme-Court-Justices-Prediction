unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
can
i
ask
a
question
about
the
visual
aid?
unknown
speaker
is
that
bag
stapled
together?
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
what
could
you
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
what
could
be
done
with
it
if
stapling
is
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
really
your
position,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
could
i
ask
you,
just
while
you
are...
so
i
can
keep
it
in
mind
while
you
go
along,
suppose
what
they
were
hunting
for
was,
say,
a
waffle
iron,
a
stolen
waffle
iron,
or
something
else
that
couldn't
go
in
the
paper
bag.
you
might
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
for
the
waffle
iron,
but
if
you
got
to
the
paper
bag,
you
wouldn't
be
searching
it,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
that's
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
look
for
what
can
go
in
a
paper
bag.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frey,
that
does
assume
that
you
could
hold
the
bag.
unknown
speaker
you
can
seize
the
bag.
unknown
speaker
in
what
did
we
recognize
that?
in
an
automobile
search?
unknown
speaker
that
we
can...
you
can
hold
the...
hold
the
item
you
want
to
search
until
you
get
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
frey,
on
the
sanders
case,
is
it
your
position
that
we
have
to
address
the
question
of
whether
sanders
was
retroactive
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
last
week
the
solicitor
general
in
another
case
was
taking
the
position
that
we
should
address
the
retroactivity
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
sanders
case
is
applicable
here--
unknown
speaker
--and
would
have
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--and
why
not?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
we
should
deal
then
and
adopt
some
rule
based
on
the
worthiness
of
the
container?
do
you
think
that
is
desirable?
unknown
speaker
is
that
more
desirable
than
addressing
ourselves
to
whether
any
article
contained
in
an
automobile
when
you
have
probable
cause
for
the
search
can
be
searched?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
better
approach
than
to
examine
the
worthiness
of
the
container,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
given
the
fact
that
you
have
an
automobile
search
exception,
and
that
you
can
reached
closed
containers
even
in
a
locked
glove
compartment
of
a
car,
is
there
a
logical
distinction
then
between
that
and
a
closed
container
in
a
trunk?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
belton
allows
currently
that
you
could
search
the
article
in
the
locked
glove
compartment
and--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frey,
wasn't
he
under
arrest
and
handcuffed
before
the
bag
was
opened?
unknown
speaker
and
handcuffed.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
haven't
finished
my
question.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
he
just
have
taken
him
and
the
bag
along?
unknown
speaker
and
you
wouldn't
have
any
fourth
amendment
problem,
right?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
really
making
a
fourth
amendment
problem
out
of
what
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
problem?
unknown
speaker
and
you
take
him
and
you
can
go...
when
you
book
him,
you
can
go
in
that
bag,
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
oh,
no.
you
arrest
him.
don't
you
take
along
what
he
has
with
him?
unknown
speaker
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
arrest,
don't
you
have
probable
cause
to
take
with
the
arrested
person
whatever
he
has
on
him?
unknown
speaker
of
his
car.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
normally
take
it
along
to
inventory
the
car?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
the
normal
procedure?
why
did
you
have
to
open
it
there?
you
had
enough
to
lock
him
up.
unknown
speaker
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
nothing
in
there
that
would
hurt
him,
that
would
hurt
anybody.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
gun
or
knife
or
anything.
unknown
speaker
and
it
wasn't
then
in
the
possession
of
the
arrested
person,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
or
that
you
had
the
wrong
car.
unknown
speaker
all
he
had
to
do
was
open
up
the
bag
and
show
you
there
was
nothing
in
there.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
i
don't
presume
that
an
average
narc
agent
is
interested
in
protecting
the
innocent.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
your
argument
that
the
government
was...
that
is
not
the
argument
the
government
has.
the
argument
is
the
government
wanted
to
find
out
if
the
man
was
violating
the
law.
isn't
that
what
their
agent
was
trying
to
find
out?
unknown
speaker
he
wasn't
trying
to
find
out
whether
he
was
innocent.
unknown
speaker
but
under
mine
he
can
look
in
there
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
my
hypothesis
was
that
he
could
be
arrested,
he
was
arrested,
he
could
be
taken
with
the
bag
to
the
place
where
he
was
to
be
incarcerated,
and
they
would
have
searched
it,
and
searched
him,
legally,
and
there
would
be
no
fourth
amendment
problem.
unknown
speaker
the
fourth
amendment
problem
came
because
you
searched
him
before
you
booked
him.
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
a
suppression
hearing
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
you
complaining
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
who's
got
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
difference,
mr.
frey,
in
the
application
of
this
problem
where
something
is
seized
in
a
large
city
like
washington,
where
you've
got
dozens
of
judges
around
with
magisterial
powers,
and
seizing
it
in...
seizing
exactly
the
same
kind
of
material
and
making
an
arrest
on
probable
cause
out
in
wyoming
or
utah
or
colorado?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
basic
point
you
are
making
is
that
if
you
can
search
the
interior
of
the
car,
taking
everything,
anything
and
everything
you
find
in
what
we
call
the
interior
of
the
car,
there
isn't
a
logical
reason
why
that
should
not
be
extended
and
enlarged.
unknown
speaker
are
there
problems
being
created
in
the
application
of
the
rules
that
we
are
discussing
here
by
the
change
in
the
structure
of
automobiles,
that
is,
the
hatchbacks,
the
newer
types
of
cars
where
they
do
not
have
a
trunk
which
is
distinct
from
the
rest
of
the
interior?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
belton...
under
belton,
what
is
the
limit
of
the
search?
unknown
speaker
that
means
the
interior
of
the
car
as
distinguished
from
the
locked
trunk
that
is
in--
unknown
speaker
--the
rear
of
the
back
seat.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
problem,
in
terms
of
definitions,
the
change
in
structure
of
cars?
if
not
in
this
case,
it
conceivably
would
be
in
some
other
cases,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
mr.
garber,
that
when
they
actually
opened
and
tested
this
container,
this
brown
paper
bag,
and
found
that
it
was
just
powdered
sugar
and
nothing
else,
or
some
other
innocuous
subject,
or
substance,
how
much
damage
has
the...
have
the
privacy
interests
of
the
person
been
impinged?
how
serious
would
that
be,
if
they
have
made
a
mistake?
unknown
speaker
at
what
point
do
you
say
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated,
when
they
opened
the
trunk
or
when
they
opened
the
bag?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
my
question.
was
the
fourth
amendment
violated
in
your
view
when
they
opened
the
trunk?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garber,
can
i
go
back
a
second?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it,
again,
in
your
view,
that
justified
opening
the
trunk?
you
said
exigent
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
is
enough
in
your
view
to
open
the
trunk?
unknown
speaker
supposing
there
had
been
a
blanket
over
everything
in
the
trunk.
would
they
have
been
authorized
to
pick
up
the
top
of
the
blanket
and
look
underneath?
unknown
speaker
didn't
that
all
happen
before
they
opened
the
trunk?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
still
looking
when
they
opened
the
paper
bag,
but
i
don't
understand,
very
frankly,
why
in...
under
your
analysis
it
is
all
right
to
open
the
trunk,
but
it
is
not
all
right
to
probe
around
in
the
trunk
and
open
bags
and
things.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garber,
would
you
agree
that
had
the
paper
bag
been
located
on
the
back
seat
of
the
vehicle,
the
police
could
have
opened
it
and
examined
the
contents?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
it...
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
had
been
in
the
locked
glove
compartment,
the
police
could
have
opened
the
bag
and
examined
the
content.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
just
because
there
is
some
little
partition
between
the
back
seat
and
the
trunk,
there
should
be
a
different
rule.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out
in
some
of
his
questions,
with
today's
motor
vehicle
design,
there
isn't
much
of
a
difference
in
many
instances,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
robbins,
mr.
garber?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
judgment
can
be
reversed
without
overruling
robbins?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
you
answer
to
me
yes?
unknown
speaker
we
would
have
to
overrule
robbins?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
regard
the
so-called
automobile
exception,
whatever
it
may
consist
of,
as
simply
a
branch
of
exigent
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
the
rule
that
we
follow,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
it
is
robbins.
unknown
speaker
what
you
mean
is,
you
are
aware
of
the
majority's
positions,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought,
mr.
garber,
that
your
position
would
be
that
as
soon
as
there
was
any
effort
to
open
the
trunk,
as
distinguished
from
the
interior
of
the
car,
whatever
the
interior
of
the
car
really
is,
that
that
is
when
the
fourth
amendment
violation
began.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--that
might
well
be
so,
but
the
question
is,
when
was
the
first
instant
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
and
you
equate
that
to
opening
the
trunk?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
the
design
is
irrelevant.
you
suggest
that.
but
then
how
do
you...
what
are
the
limits
on
the
interior
as
the
court
applied
it
in
the
belton
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
your
expectation
of
privacy
when
you
are
driving
down
a
public
street
with
no
shades
on
the
windows
of
present-day
cars
in
not
as
great
in
a
car
as
when
you
are
sitting
in
your
house.
unknown
speaker
people
can
look
in
the
windows.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
true
also
that
if
a
person
places
an
envelop
in
his
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
as
he
walks
down
the
street,
that
manifests
an
expectation
of
privacy,
and
yet
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
you
can
search
the
entire
person.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
certainly
the
same
general
factors
should
govern.
unknown
speaker
is
the
magistrate
housed
in
the
same
building?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
no
difference
between
the
practical
problems,
if
you
are
talking
about
washington,
d.
c.,
or
out
in
the
prairies
and
the
mountains
in
the
west
and
other
parts
of
the
country--
unknown
speaker
--where
you
might
be
100
or
200
miles
from
the
nearest
magistrate?
unknown
speaker
when
an
arrest
is
made
on
the
street
on
probable
cause,
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
probable
cause,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
arrest
which...
the
search
which
can
be
made
incident
to
that
arrest?
unknown
speaker
how
about
his
billfold.
they
will
take
his
billfold
out,
out
of
his
pocket.
can
they
look
in
the
billfold?
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose
he
has
got
a
bunch
of
letters
in
his
pocket,
in
envelopes,
and
perhaps
not
in
envelopes.
can
they
look
at
all
those
things?
unknown
speaker
can
they
take
his
shoes
off
and
see
if
there
is
anything
in
the
way
of
either
weapons
or
drugs
concealed
in
the
shoes?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
pretty
big
invasion
of
privacy
there,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
do
you
think
robbins
would...
would
say
that
you
could
search
any
kind
of
a
container
an
arrestee
has
with
him
wherever
he
is
arrested?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
suitcase.
he
is
carrying
a
suitcase
with
him
when
he
is
arrested.
can
the
suitcase
be
searched
on
the
spot
incident
to
arrest?
unknown
speaker
well,
incident
to
arrest
doesn't
depend
on
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
and
robbins
didn't
go
on
probable
cause.
it
went
on
incident
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
now,
suppose
instead
of
being
arrested
in
your
car
and
where
you
had
a
suitcase
in
the
passenger
compartment,
you
are
arrested
on
the
street
carrying
a
suitcase.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
i
am
just
asking
you,
what
do
you
think
the
state
of
the
law
is
now,
after
belton
and
robbins,
in
my
example.
you
are
arrested
on
the
street
with
a...
carrying
a
locked
suitcase.
can
the
suitcase
be
searched
on
the
spot
incident
to
the
arrest?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
what
do
you
think
the
state
of
the
law
is
if
you...
whether
or
not
you
can
search
it
on
the
spot,
you
take
the
arrestee
to
the
police
station,
and
you
are
going
to
incarcerate
him?
what
do
you
do
with
the
trunk...
what
do
you
do
with
his
locked
suitcase?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
want
to
look
in
the
suitcase,
you
have
to
get
a
warrant,
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--you
cannot
inventory
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
just...
you
are
just
going
to
lock
him
up
and
keep
his
suitcase.
you
are
going
to
put
the
suitcase
in
the
property
room.
unknown
speaker
even
to
inventory
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
that
is...
do
you
think
that
is
what
the
law
is
now?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
what
the
law
is
now?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
would
there
be
exigent
circumstances
in
your
submission,
in
a
case
like
this?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
going
to
arrest
a
man,
you
are
going
to
arrest
the
man,
you
can
always--
unknown
speaker
--when...
why
would
you
ever
be
permitted
to
look
into
that
paper
bag,
or
in--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
it
is
in...
but
there
would
never
be
exigent
circumstances
if
you
find
it
in
the
trunk?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
ever...
can
you
imagine
any?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
they
could
take
the
bag.
they
could
take
the
bag.
they
just
couldn't
look
in
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
ever
be
exigent
circumstances
where
you
could
look
in
the
bag?
unknown
speaker
but
not
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
so
your
nationwide...
your
nationwide
exigent
circumstances
rule
is
a
rule
that
says
don't
look
in
paper
bags
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
would
you
apply
that
if
a
bag
like
the
one
your
friend
has
presented,
in
being
taken
by
the
officer,
he
concludes
that
there
is
a
pistol
in
there,
he
can
feel
it
just
by
taking
the
bag,
its
weight
and
its
configuration?
can
he
open
the
bag
and
take
the
pistol
out?
unknown
speaker
or,
since,
as
you
suggest,
he
has
it
securely
in
his
possession,
he
must
take
it
down
to
the
courthouse
and
get
a
magistrate
or
someone
to
issue
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
outward
configuration
doesn't
reveal
the
content
here
until
the
policeman--
unknown
speaker
--feels
it
with
his
hands.
unknown
speaker
but
the
weapon
can't...
be
used
against
him
if
he
has
got
it
in
his
possession
and
hands
it
to
one
of
his
fellow
officers.
unknown
speaker
whatever
is
in
the
bag,
he
isn't
going
to
hand
it
back
to
the
arrested
person,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
so
on
your
theory,
he
doesn't
need
to
open
it
to
be
sure
that
it
is
a
gun,
because
he
can
wait
until
he
gets
downtown
and
gets
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
which...
which
can
he
do?
unknown
speaker
must
he
have
a
warrant
before
he
opens
the
bag
to
see
if
it
is
really
a
gun
instead
of
a
monkey
wrench?
unknown
speaker
or
a
monkey
wrench?
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
us
to
overrule
robbins?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
may
i
ask
this
question
about
your
bright
line
point
insofar
as
it
is
relevant
to
a
choice
between
the
two
submissions
that
the
government
makes?
one
is
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
containers,
private
and
non-private,
and
your
second
submission
is
that
once
you
can
get
into
the
car,
you
can
search
everything
within
the
car
that
might
contain
the
contraband
for
which
you
are
searching.
which
of
the
two
submissions
would
be
better
from
a
law
enforcement
standpoint
in
terms
of
simplicity
of
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
no
greater
invasion
of
legitimate
privacy
to
go
into
the
trunk
and
open
everything
in
the
trunk
than
to
go
into
the
interior
of
the
car,
however
that
is
defined,
and
open
everything
in
the
interior
of
the
car?
no
difference
in
privacy--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
frey?
you
don't
contend
there
is
no
privacy
interest
in
a
paper
bag,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
say
you
had
an
airport
case,
and
you
had
enough
of
a
suspicion
to
stop
a
person
and
ask
him
a
question
or
two.
it
wouldn't
follow
that
you
could
say,
open
up
your
paper
bag
and
let
me
look
in
it,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
because
there
is
some
privacy
even
in
the
paper
bag.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
if...
you
say
then
that
the...
that
you
should
get
a
different
result
where
the
container
is
in
a
car
than
if
you
find
it
somewhere
else,
say
in
a...
say
you
know
a
person
has
checked
a
container
in
a
checkroom,
and
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
it
contains
contraband.
unknown
speaker
whether
it
is
found
in
a
car
or
wherever
it
is
found?
unknown
speaker
and
the
theory
is
just
the...
is
this
lowered
expectation
of
privacy?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
now
draw
the...
say
that
the
paper
bag
is
in
the
checkroom
along
with
a
locked
suitcase,
and
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
them
both.
you
would
still
have
a
different
rule
for--
unknown
speaker
--you
accept
those...
you
accept
those
holdings
as
right,
or
are
you
just
accepting
them--
unknown
speaker
--what
did
we
invite...
what
did
we
invite
the
parties
to
address
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
which
would...
which
would...
what
do
you
think
that
question
involves?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
think
if
we
overturn
robbins
we
are
overturning
the
rule
that
you
can't
search
a
locked
suitcase
in
the
back
end
of
a
trunk?
unknown
speaker
maybe
we
posed
the
wrong
question.
unknown
speaker
just
suppose
for
a
moment...
do
you
draw
a
line
between
a
locked
trunk
and
an
open
trunk,
and
an
unlocked
trunk?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
you
would?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
said
you
could
search
the
bag
but
you
couldn't
search
the
locked
trunk.
my
point
was,
could
you
search
an
unlocked
trunk,
if
it
was
closed?
