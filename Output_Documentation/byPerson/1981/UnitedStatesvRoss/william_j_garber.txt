mr.
william
j.
garber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
behalf
of
the
respondent,
our
position
is
succinctly
that
the
circuit
court
was
correct
in
invalidating
the
search
in
this
case,
and
that
the
circuit
court's
opinion
has
been
reinforced
by
this
court's
judgment
in
robbins
versus
california.
mr.
william
j.
garber
i
would
answer
it
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
that
had
occurred,
and
it
didn't
occur
in
this
case,
because
actually
the
substance
was
not
even
field
tested
until
after
ross
had
been
arrested,
after
the
vehicle
had
been
taken
to
the
police
headquarters,
and
after
the
police
officer
had
opened
the
trunk,
removed
the...
the
items,
and
taken
them
to
the
mobile
crime
lab.
in
the
transcript
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
officer
testified
that
it
wasn't
until
after
he
got
to
the
mobile
crime
lab
that
the
field
test
of
one
of
the
packages
was
actually
conducted,
but
the
point
is
that
ross
in
this
case
was
initially
arrested
on
a
weapons
charge.
after
the
car
was
stopped,
and
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
was
seized,
a
gun
was
found
in
the
glove
compartment.
it
was
at
that
point
that
he
was
placed
under
arrest,
and
he
was
handcuffed,
and
he
was
securely
in
police
custody.
so,
in
this
particular
case,
even
if
the
substance
had
turned
out
to
be
an
innocuous
substance,
ross
still
would
have
been
in
custody
by
virtue
of
the
finding
of
the
weapon
in
the
glove
compartment.
mr.
william
j.
garber
i
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
when
they
opened
the
bag,
if
we
are
going
to
consistently
apply
chadwick
and
sanders
and
ross.
the
reason
is
this.
when
the
police
officers
had
received
the
information
from
the
informant,
the
only
thing
they
knew
was
that
ross
had
been
engaged
allegedly
in
the
sale
of
narcotics
from
the
trunk
of
his
car.
the
police
had
no
information
that
a
particular
container
such
as
a
suitcase,
or
a
briefcase,
or
a
paper
bag,
was
involved.
so,
when
they
proceeded
to
the
location
of
the
arrest,
and
stopped
the
car,
they...
they
intended
to
search
that
vehicle
to
see
if
it
had
contraband.
now,
after
ross
had
been
removed
and
the...
and
the
gun
was
found
and
he
was
handcuffed,
the
police
opened
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle.
they
didn't
see
contraband
in
plain
view.
they
had
to
open
a
container
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
fruits
of
the
search
were
actually
in
the
trunk
of
the
car.
mr.
william
j.
garber
when
they
opened
the
trunk,
not
at
that
point,
because
we
would
have
to
concede,
and
of
course
the
main
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
at
that
point
there
may
have
been
exigent
circumstances
for
conducting
a
search
of
the
vehicle
on
the
scene,
but
that
once
they
had
opened
the
trunk,
and
after
ross
had
been
in
custody,
and
they
observed...
they
didn't
observe
contraband
in
plain
view,
at
that
point
the
exigencies
were
gone.
they
may
have
had
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
contraband
was
contained
either
in
the
pouch
or
in
the
paper
bag,
but
they
wouldn't
have
known
that
unless
they
actually
conducted
a
search.
mr.
william
j.
garber
yes.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well,
at
that
point
they
had,
as
the
court
found,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
ross
had
violated
the
law
and
there
was
contraband
in
the
car.
mr.
william
j.
garber
under
the...
as
i
understand
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court,
yes,
because
they...
and
that
was
the...
that
goes
as
far
back
as
carroll.
mr.
william
j.
garber
now
we
get
into
what
constitutes
and
what
does
not
constitute
a
container.
the
position
of
the
respondent
and
the
position
we
have
taken
in
the
brief
is
this,
that
once
the
respondent
has
been
taken
into
custody,
and
once
the
movable
object
has
been
reduced
to
exclusive
police
custody,
and
once
the
police
officers
find
that
the
fruits
of
their
search
certainly
aren't
in
plain
view,
then
at
that
point
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
cease.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well,
they
were
still
looking
for
contraband.
they
were
still
looking
for
contraband.
mr.
william
j.
garber
because,
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
and
as
we...
as
we
attempt
to
argue
here,
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
occurs
at
a
point
where
the
exigent
circumstances
cease,
and
the
exigent
circumstances
ceased
at
the
point
where
ross
was
in
custody,
the
vehicle
was
in
custody,
and
the
officers
did
not
find
the
fruits
of
the
contraband
until
they
were
able
to
open
the
container
on
the
scene.
now,
at
that
point,
we
submit
that
both
the
vehicle
and
its
contents
should
have
been
removed,
and
a
warrant
applied
for.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
there
is
a
cost
involved
in
obtaining
a
warrant.
if
we
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
police
officers
removed
the
vehicle
from
the
scene,
took
it
to
police
headquarters.
the
police
officer
testified
that
after
he
had
arrived
at
the
police
headquarters,
he
went
up,
he
went
back,
got
two
other
police
officers,
they
came
down,
they
opened
the
trunk,
they
removed
the
pouch,
and
they
removed
the
paper
bag.
they
were
taken
to
mobile
crime
for
an
analysis.
he
said
he
was
there
for
two
hours.
he
testified
that
after
he
completed
all
of
the
forms
and
the
paper
work
in
this
case,
it
was
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
the
following
day
that
he
left.
so
in
this...
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
have
the
police
officer
engaged
in
a
five-hour
period
of
processing
this
particular
arrest.
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
prepare
a
warrant
application
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
garber
under
belton...
under
belton,
this
court
has
held
that
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
could
be
searched--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--and
that
would
be
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
mr.
william
j.
garber
correct.
mr.
william
j.
garber
yes,
because
the
area
of
the
trunk
is
an
area
which
was
removed
from
the
area
which
is
considered
incident
to
an
arrest.
now,
of
course,
i
am
not
here
to
reargue
belton,
because
we...
the
facts
in
belton
and
the
facts
in
this
case
are
different,
but
i
do
say
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
and
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle
as
far
as
police
officers
being
permitted
to
invade
that
area
once
an
arrest
has
taken
place,
and
there
is
no
danger
that
evidence
is
going
to
be
destroyed,
or
that
the
arrested
person
can
grab
a
weapon.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well,
there
may
not
be,
but
robbins,
we
must
remember,
was
a
station
wagon,
where
the
tailgate
was
lifted,
and
under
the
tailgate
was
a
luggage
compartment,
and--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--oh,
yes.
i
think
that
robbins--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--oh,
i
think
that
if
this
judgment
is
reversed,
it
would
certainly
be
inconsistent
with
robbins,
because--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
william
j.
garber
i
would
think
the
court
would
have
to,
for
this
reason,
that
in
the
robbins
case,
as
in
this
case,
there
was
an
arrest
after
the
police
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
was
contained
in
the
car.
in
robbins,
that
probable
cause
didn't
arise
until
after
the
officer
smelled
the
odor
of
marijuana
emanating
from
the
passenger
compartment,
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
a
search
of
the
car
was
conducted.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
difference
between
robbins
and
ross
is
that
the
police
acted
on
the
basis
of
an
informant's
tip,
but
robbins
started
out
as
an
automobile
search,
and
ross
was
an
automobile
search,
but
the
point
of
departure
came
where
the
police
in
robbins
seized
the
plastic
bag,
and
the
police
in
ross
seized
a
paper
bag.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
into
a
worthy
or
an
unworthy
container
rule,
because
if
we
apply
the
exigent
circumstance
doctrine
in
all
of
these
cases,
then
all
we
have
to
determine
is
at
what
point
the
exigencies
ceased,
and
at
the
point
where
the
exigencies
ceased,
then
the
warrant
requirement
comes
into
play.
mr.
william
j.
garber
the
automobile
exception
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
an
exception,
to
be
an
exception,
starting
with
carroll.
but
if
we
look
at
carroll,
in
carroll
there
was
no...
there
was
no
cause
to
arrest
the
occupants
in
that
case,
because
the
offense,
transporting
liquor,
was
a
misdemeanor,
and
it
had
to
have
been
committed
within
the
presence
of
the
officers.
so,
the
exigencies
were
in
searching
the
vehicle
to
see
whether
or
not
contraband
was
in
the
car.
in
this
particular
case,
ross
had
been
arrested.
he
wasn't
going
anywhere.
the
vehicle
had
been
released
into
police
custody,
and
even
carroll
states
that
if
there...
if
it
is
practical
to
get
a
warrant,
even
in
the
case
of
an
automobile,
one
must
be
obtained.
mr.
william
j.
garber
not
since
chambers,
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
in
this
whole
area
is
chambers,
when
chambers
permits
a
search
of
a
vehicle
to
take
place
at
a
location
other
than
where
the
initial
arrest
occurred,
and
perhaps
it
is
chambers,
as
we
have
indicated,
that
really
needs
to
be
reconsidered.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well,
of
course,
i
am
aware
of
your
honors'
position
in
these
matters.
the
court
can
really
take
two
roads.
the
court--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--yes.
well--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--but
the
intrusion
went
beyond
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
garber
the
intrusion
went
into
the
container
itself.
mr.
william
j.
garber
when
the
police
opened
the
bag,
because
in
robbins,
for
example,
the
police
opened
the
tailgate,
and
also
lifted
up
the
luggage--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--oh,
yes.
i
would
think...
because
we
are
talking
about
automobile
design.
i
don't
think
these
cases
should
turn
on
the
design
of
a
vehicle.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
issue.
nor
should
the
case
turn
on
the
configuration
or
the
worthiness
of
the
particular
container.
mr.
william
j.
garber
the
limits
of
the
interior
would
be
that
area
which
had
been
occupied
by
either
the
driver
or
the
passenger,
because
it
was
in
that
area
that
weapons
could
be
concealed
and
evidence
could
be
hidden,
so
we
are
talking
about
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle
as
opposed
to
the
trunk
or
storage
area,
and
again,
we
get
into
automobile
design.
i
don't
think
design
is
relevant.
we
are
talking
now
about
area
within
the
arrestee's
control,
and
in
belton,
of
course,
the
decision
was
that
the...
actually
the
passenger
area
of
the
car
was
the
area
that
could
be
permissibly...
permissibly
searched.
but
the
problem
with
the
automobile
exception
as
it
has
now
evolved
is
the...
well,
it
started
out
with
an
inherent
mobility
factor,
and
that...
then
it
evolved
into
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy,
and
then
state
and
governmental
regulation.
we
submit
that
the
inherently...
inherent
mobility
factor
is
really
the
only
true
and
genuine
factor
that
should
play
a
part
in
these
cases,
because,
let's
face
it,
an
automobile
is
a
very
expensive
piece
of
personal
property.
next
to
a
house,
it
is
the
most
expensive
investment
an
individual
can
make,
and
to
say
that
merely
because
you
own
a
car,
that
once
you
get
in
that
car
your
expectation
of
privacy
diminishes,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
compatible
with
the
real
world
as
we
know
it.
the
automobile
today
is
much
different
than
the
automobile
of
30,
40,
50
years
ago.
mr.
william
j.
garber
that
may
be
true.
mr.
william
j.
garber
that's
true,
but
there
are
areas
of
that
vehicle
where
that
expectation
of
privacy
can
be
manifested,
and
it
is
those
areas
that
we
are
talking
about.
in
other
words,
if
an
individual
places,
say,
a
briefcase
or
a
paper
bag
or
some
other
container
in
the
trunk
of
a
vehicle,
as
opposed
to
the
interior,
i
think
that
manifests
an
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
william
j.
garber
yes,
but
this
isn't
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
case.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well,
i
don't
think
so,
because
search
incident
to
arrest
is
entirely
different
from
the
automobile
search
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
when
you
have
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest,
you
are
attempting
either
to
seize
evidence
immediately
associated
with
the
person
or
means
by
which
the
individual
can
escape,
and
therefore
this
court
and
other
courts
have
permitted
a
search
not
only
of
the
person,
a
full-blown
search
of
the
person,
but
also
of
the
immediate
area.
but
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
ross
case,
as
in
the
robbins
case,
this
wasn't
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest,
because
the
arrest
had
been
effected,
and
when...
once
again
i
stress
this
inherent
mobility
factor.
if...
if
this
factor
is
applied
in
these
types
of
cases,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
paper
bags
and
cardboard
boxes
and
shaving
kits.
we
only
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
the
exigencies
permitted
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
at
the
particular
time,
and
if
that
is
removed,
then
any
search
conducted
without
a
warrant
is...
is
unreasonable.
now,
i
still
don't
understand
the
government's
argument
as
to
the
costs
involved
in
obtaining
a
warrant.
we
are
talking
about,
in
this
type
of
case,
essentially
a
one
or
two-page
affidavit,
an
affidavit
that
could
have
been
prepared
within
the
time
period
that
the
processing
in
this
case
occurred,
an
affidavit
that
could
have
been
taken
to
the
magistrate
either
that
evening
or
the
following
day,
or
even
telephoned
in.
mr.
william
j.
garber
the
magistrates,
of
course,
their
offices
were
in
the...
in
the
courthouse,
but
they
do...
they
are
available
at
home,
and
i
do
know
that,
from
talking
to
the
magistrates,
that
one
of
the
procedures
is
the
ability
to
record
the
oral
affidavit
as
it
is
given
over
the
phone,
and
then
to
reduce
that
to
writing
later.
so,
even
assuming
it
is
midnight
or
2:00
o'clock
in
the
morning,
the
magistrate
on
duty
could
take
the
oral
affidavit,
and
could
give
the
authorization
to
conduct
the
search
under
the
amendment
to
the
rule,
and
it
is
that
technology
which
i
think
undercuts
the
government's
argument.
mr.
william
j.
garber
oh,
i
think--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--oh,
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
because
assuming
you
have
a
single
law
enforcement
officer
who
is
covering
90
square
miles
of
territory
in
a
vehicle,
and
he
encounters
a
situation
such
as
robbins,
for
example,
and
it
is
going
to
take
maybe...
maybe
45
minutes
or
an
hour
before
he
gets
backup,
the
exigencies
of
that
situation
may
permit
a
result
which
is
different
from
this
case.
that
is
why
the
exigent
circumstances
factor
has
a
plasticity
and
a
flexibility
which
allows
it
to
be
applied
nationwide.
so,
of
course,
problems
of
law
enforcement
are
much
different
in
sparsely
populated
areas
than
they
are
in
large
metropolitan
areas.
in
this
case,
we
had
three
police
officers
on
the
scene.
they
were
there
within
ten
minutes
of
the
call.
they
took
the
vehicle
back
to
the
police
headquarters
within...
within
minutes.
and
to
further
undercut
the
government's
argument,
the
following
day,
as
the
record
of
this
case
will
show,
when
the
complaint
was
filed
with
the
magistrate,
that
complaint
contained
a
statement
of
facts,
a
probable
cause
statement
of
facts
which
was
really
tantamount
to
a
warrant
affidavit,
so
there
was
no
reason
in
this
case
why
a
warrant
could
not
have
been
obtained,
any
more
than
there
was
a
reason
in
robbins
for
not
obtaining
a
warrant.
we
submit
that
robbins
is
good
law,
that
the...
that
the
plurality
of
opinion
in
the
case
is
good
because
it...
it
upholds
the...
the
philosophical
and
the
considerations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
places
the...
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
before
the
executive,
and
of
course
the
more
you
whittle
away
on
the
warrant
requirements,
the
more
danger
you
have
of...
of
one
branch
actually
encroaching
on
the
powers
of
the
other.
so,
we
submit
that
the
warrant
requirement
has
a
real
function,
and
that
this
business
about
the
warrant
in
the
case
of
a
dwelling
sets
the
perimeter
of
the
search,
that's
not
the...
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is
that
it
places
a
natural
and
detached
magistrate
between
the
citizen
and
the
police
officer.
and
look
at
the
savings.
if
there
had
been
an
affidavit
in
support
of
a
search
warrant
in
this
case,
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here,
because
the
reviewing
court
could
look
at
the
face
of
the
affidavit
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
affidavit
established
probable
cause.
i
could
recite
that
affidavit
to
this
court
within
five
minutes,
as
to
what
was
needed.
the
affidavit
in
the
first
paragraph
could
have
obtained
the
informant
information
which
would
have
satisfied
the
aguillar
and
spinelli.
the
observations
of
the
police
officer
which
corroborated
the
fact
that
the
car
was
there
and
the
defendant
matched
the
description
given
by
the
informant
would
have
been
the
second
paragraph,
and
the
third
paragraph
would
have
recited
that
after
the
defendant
had
been
arrested,
the
police
officers
observed
two
containers
in
the
trunk
compartment
of
the
car,
and
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
contained
narcotics.
these
containers
could
have
been
seized.
the
magistrate
or
the
judge
could
have
given
his
authorization,
and
they
could
have
been
opened,
and
instead
of
having
a
evidentiary
hearing
in
which
a
police
officer,
counsel,
and
the
court
were
involved,
say,
an
hours
of
testimony...
in
this
case
there
were
109
pages
of
transcript
on
this
motion
to
suppress.
if
there
had
been
a
warrant,
the
judge
would
have
been
able
to
pass
upon
the
legality
of
the
search
by
looking
at
the
affidavit,
unless
you
can
show
that
the
affidavit
could
be
attacked,
as
in
franks
versus
delaware,
but
you
would
have
to
prove
at
that
point
that
the
police
officer
deliberately
lied.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well,
certainly
the...
the
individual
can
be
searched.
mr.
william
j.
garber
oh,
i
think
they
can
under
the...
under
the
robinson
case--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--as
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest,
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
decision...
the
decisions
on
the
matter,
once
a
person
is
in
custody,
he
is
subject
to
a
thorough
search.
i
think
robinson
decided
that
for
a
traffic
arrest.
mr.
william
j.
garber
oh,
i
think
they
do.
i
think
they
do.
but
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
search--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--there
is
an
invasion
of
privacy,
certainly,
but
it
is
one
of
the...
it
is
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement,
and
that
is
the
search
incident
to
arrest,
and
of
course
in
belton
that
certainly
was
really
an
extreme
view.
as
we
see
it,
in
belton,
to
permit,
as
this
court
did,
this
complete
thorough
search
of
the
passenger
interior
of
the
vehicle
went
far
beyond
anything
which...
which
your
honor
has
suggested.
mr.
william
j.
garber
on
his
person?
mr.
william
j.
garber
all
right.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
at
that
point
the...
the
probable
cause,
like
in
sanders
and
chadwick,
was
directed
more
toward
the--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--if
you
are
going
to--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
garber
if
you...
if
you
apply
belton,
i
would
think
that
this
court
would
hold
that--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--i
would
think
under...
under
the
rationale
of
belton
that
it
would
be,
because
it
is
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
mr.
william
j.
garber
under
those
circumstances,
the
exigencies
have
passed,
because
he
has
been
taken
into
custody.
he
has
been
separated
from
his
suitcase.
mr.
william
j.
garber
you
have
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
william
j.
garber
if
you
suspect
that
it
contains
fruits
of
crime--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--i
would
think
you
would
have
to
have
a
warrant
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
william
j.
garber
oh,
certainly.
i
don't
think--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--i
don't
think--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
permissible
to
inventory
the
suitcase
under
those
circumstances,
no.
mr.
william
j.
garber
it
is
my
feeling
it
is,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
garber
but
as
i
say,
if
we
get
back
to
the
exigent
circumstances
as
being
the
only...
the
only
exception
in
this
particular
area,
i
think
it
is
going
to
clear
away
a
lot
of
the
uncertainty
that
exists
in
this
whole
field.
mr.
william
j.
garber
all
right,
the
police...
the
police
have--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--right.
mr.
william
j.
garber
if
the
person,
say,
was
carrying
the
paper
bag
and
was
lawfully
arrested,
as
in
belton,
if
the
paper
bag
were
inside
the...
inside
the
passenger
compartment--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--not
under
the...
not
under
these
circumstances,
no,
because
once--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--yes,
i
could
imagine
them
in
the
case
of...
in
the
case
of
carroll,
and
those
types
of
cases,
where
the
police
officers
at
the...
at
that
point
could
not
have
detained
the
vehicle.
the
vehicle
could
have
been
taken
away.
in
the
case
where
they
would
have
no
cause
to
arrest
the
occupants.
mr.
william
j.
garber
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
garber
if
it's
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
mr.
william
j.
garber
not
otherwise.
that
would
be
our...
that
is
our
position,
and
that
is
the
position
that
we
have
advocated.
mr.
william
j.
garber
no,
it
says
don't
look
in
those
articles
or
containers
which
have
been
immobilized,
which
are
in
the
custody
of
the
police,
where
there
is
no
danger
of
these
articles
being
lost
or
destroyed,
and
there
is
ample
opportunity
to
secure
judicial
approval.
at
that
point,
you
need
the
warrant,
because
the
exigencies
no
longer
exist.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--well,
then
we
are
getting
into
the
area
as
to
whether
or
not
the
outward
configuration
of
the
item
itself
reveals
its
contents.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well,
he
seized
it.
mr.
william
j.
garber
he
seized
it,
and
at
that
point,
if
he
seizes
it
and
he
realizes
that
it
is
a
weapon,
he
realizes
that
it
is
a
weapon,
i
think
we
have
a
different
situation,
because
the...
the
configuration
of
the--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--no,
but
by
the
same
token--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--oh,
certainly
not.
certainly
not.
but--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--well,
that
is
one...
that
is
one
answer,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
garber
well--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--well,
if
he
is
an
experienced
police
officer,
and
he
can
ascertain
by
the
weight
and
the
feel
of
the
bag
that
there
is
a
weapon
in
there--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--if
he
is
in
doubt,
then
i
think
he
needs
a
warrant.
as
i
say,
all
of
these...
we
are
dealing
here
with
relative
factors,
where
the
facts
in
each
case
is
different,
but
arguing
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
i
don't
see
any
distinction
between
this
case
and
robinson
at
all,
and
in
robbins,
where
the
tailgate
was
opened
and
the
luggage
compartment
was
opened,
all
of
that
was
sanctioned
by
the
court.
it
was
only
when
they
opened
the
container
itself
that
the
court
felt
they
needed
a
warrant.
in
this
case,
when
they
opened
the
paper
bag,
that
was
the
point
when--
mr.
william
j.
garber
--thank
you.
