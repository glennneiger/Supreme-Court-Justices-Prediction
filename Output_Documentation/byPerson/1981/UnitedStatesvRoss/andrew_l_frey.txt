mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
reversed
respondent's
conviction
on
the
ground
that
certain
evidence
should
have
been
suppressed.
the
evidence
was
heroin
found
in
a
paper
bag
seized
on
probable
cause
from
the
trunk
of
respondent's
automobile
and
searched
without
a
warrant.
so
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
police
officers
who
possess
probable
cause
to
search
a
paper
bag
found
during
the
lawful
search
of
an
automobile
must
procure
a
search
warrant
before
examining
the
contents
of
that
bag.
i
think
this
divides
itself
into
two
sub-issues,
first,
in
general,
whether
a
paper
bag
is
a
container
of
the
kind
to
which
the
warrant
requirement
applies,
and
secondly,
assuming
that
it
is
outside
an
automobile,
whether
the
requirement
applies
when
it
is
discovered
in
the
course
of
a
probable
cause
search
of
an
automobile.
i
don't
usually
employ
visual
aids
in
my
arguments
before
this
court,
but
i
think
in
this
case
it
is
important
not
to
stick
solely
to
abstractions,
so
i
do
have
a
paper
bag
which
resembles,
although
it
is
not
the
actual
bag
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
now,
what
this
case
is
about
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
requires
officers
who
needed
no
warrant
to
arrest
respondent,
no
warrant
to
carefully
examine
the
passenger
compartment
and
glove
compartment
of
his
car,
and
to
unlock
and
search
its
trunk,
to
stop
their
search
upon
coming
across
a
paper
bag
like
this,
which
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
contains
heroin,
to
carry
the
bag
carefully
to
the
courthouse,
to
spend
several
hours
preparing
and
presenting
a
warrant
application
to
a
magistrate
before
they
may
open
the
top
of
the
bag
and
look
inside.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
sure
that
i
would
contend
for
the
same
result,
for
a
number
of
reasons
which
i
will
get
to,
but
it
is
potentially
a
relevant
consideration,
because
the
steps
that
may
have
been
taken
to
preserve
an
interest
of
privacy
have
some
bearing,
in
my
view,
on
the
application
of
the
warrant
requirement.
i
think
stapling
a
paper
bag
together
would
clearly
be
insufficient
to
activate
the
requirements.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
some
preliminary
observations--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
with
a
paper
bag?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
anything
could
be
done
with
a
paper
bag
that
would
be
sufficient
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that
is...
that
is
our
position,
but
in
order
for
us
to
prevail
in
this
case,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
the
exceptional
case
in
which
a
paper
bag
were
stapled,
taped,
marked
"private
contents,
do
not
open.
"
and
so
on.
we
would
still
argue
that
the
paper
bag
is
such
an
unsuitable
container
to
maintain
substantial
privacy
interests
that
the
costs
of
the
warrant
requirement
are
not
justified,
but
that
would
present
an
exceptional
case,
and
i
think
that
what
is
before
the
court
today
must
be
judged
in
terms
of
the
general
class
of
cases
involving
searches
of
containers
that
ordinarily
are
not
used
as
a
repository
for
highly
private
or
personal
effects.
now,
i
wanted
to
make
a
couple
of
preliminary
observations,
and
the
first
is
that
search
and
seizure
issues
generally
have
two
facets.
the
first
is
the
substantive
inquiry
into
the
amount
and
quality
of
the
justification
the
police
must
possess
before
they
may
conduct
a
search,
and
the
second
is
the
procedural
inquiry
into
whether
a
warrant
should
be
required
as
a
precondition
to
the
search.
now,
without
denigrating
the
importance
of
the
warrant
in
appropriate
cases,
i
submit
that
the
substantive
requirement
in
cases
like
this,
probable
cause,
is
the
far
more
important
protection
in
safeguarding
basic
fourth
amendment
values.
in
this
case,
it
is
conceded
that
the
substantive
requirements
were
satisfied
by
the
existence
of
probable
cause,
so
the
only
question
is
whether
the
additional
procedural
prophylaxis
of
the
warrant
requirement
is
appropriate
in
this
context.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
and
i
want
to
make--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
want
to
make
a
point
completely
clear
in
this.
we
are
not
saying
that
a
paper
bag,
as
modest
as
it
is,
has
no
privacy
interests,
or
that
police
can
look
in
paper
bags
any
time
they
feel
like
it,
randomly,
or
without
justification.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
scope
of
your
search
is
determined
by
what
you
are
looking
for.
in
this
case
it
was
reasonable
to
look
for
heroin
in
a
paper
bag.
now,
the
second
preliminary
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
lawfulness
of
the
search
will
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
simply
the
timing
of
that
review.
that
is,
will
it
occur
by
a
magistrate
before
the
search
or
will
it
occur
in
some
other
forum
after
the
search,
a
suppression
hearing
or
a
bivens
action.
also,
without
wanting
to
belabor
the
point,
i
do
want
to
remind
the
court
that
it
is
really
beyond
serious
dispute
that
neither
the
language
nor
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
directly
supports
the
imposition
of
a
warrant
requirement
in
a
case
like
this.
the
warrant
requirement
is
rather
a
judicially
created
one
designed
to
implement
the
reasonableness
requirement
of
the
first
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
say
this
not
as
a
criticism
of
the
judicial
imposition
of
a
warrant
requirement,
because
i
believe
that
the
court
has
correctly
perceived
that
it
is
ordinarily
unreasonable
to
permit
certain
kinds
of
searches
to
proceed
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
judgment
of
a
police
officer.
what
i
hope
to
persuade
the
court
today
is
that
any
inquiry
into
the
wisdom
of
ruling
certain
classes
of
searches
unreasonable
per
se
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant
depends
on
a
consideration
of
the
extent
to
which
the
warrant
requirement
serves
the
basic
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
particular
context.
this
requires
weighing
the
benefits
that
may
be
derived
from
the
warrant
requirement
against
the
costs
that
are
associated
with
the
procedure,
and
the
analysis
that
we
espouse
for
assessing
the
value
of
the
warrant
procedure
is
precisely
that
employed
by
the
court
for
determining
the
procedures
required
to
satisfy
due
process
in
procedural
due
process
cases.
i
would
like
to
quote
briefly
from
the
opinion
of
mathews
against
eldridge.
it
is
at
page
20
of
our
brief.
the
court
said
that
you
should
consider,
"first,
the
private
interest
that
will
be
affected
by
the
official
action;
second,
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
deprivation
of
such
interest
through
the
procedures
used,
and
the
probable
value,
if
any,
of
additional
or
substitute
procedural
safeguards;
and
finally,
the
government's
interest,
including
the
function
involved
and
the
fiscal
or
administrative
burden
that
the
additional
or
substitute
procedural
requirement
would
entail.
"
so,
let
me
turn
first
to
a
consideration
of
the
benefits
that
might
be
realized
from
the
warrant
procedure
as
applied
to
containers
such
as
respondent's
paper
bag
or
mr.
robbins'
plastic
wrapped
parcel.
now,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
essentially
identified
three
types
of
benefits
associated
with
the
warrant
procedure.
one
important
benefit
in
some
contexts
is
that
the
warrant
limits
the
scope
of
the
search
by
particularizing
the
area
to
be
searched
and
the
items
to
be
seized.
in
the
case
of
container
searches,
this
benefit
is
essentially
absent,
because
the
item
has
already
been
seized,
the
area
of
the
search
is
quite
clear,
and
in
the
case
of
a
paper
bag,
there
is
no
practical
way
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
search
inside
the
paper
bag.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
is
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
could
not
have
a
meaningful
warrant
requirement
if
you
didn't
first
allow
a
seizure
of
the
item.
i
mean,
the
court
has
recognized
that
a
seizure
is
permitted
on
probable
cause.
it
is
only
the
search
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
was
recognized
in
chadwick,
and
in
sanders.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
seriously
controverted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
we
have
not
raised
that
issue.
that
issue
was
in
the
case.
it
was
disposed
of
adversely
to
us
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
incorrect,
but
we
have
not
presented
the
issue
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
and
it
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
denigrate
the
importance
of
the
retroactivity
question.
it
is
just
that
in
selecting
this...
this
case
had
another
important
issue.
we
try
generally
to
select
the
issues
that
are
important
and
that
it
is
useful
for
the
court
to
consider.
it
is
going
to
decide
the
retroactivity
issue
in
the
johnson
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
believe
that
sanders
governs
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
of
the
difference
between
luggage
and
insubstantial
containers
of
the
type
we
are
arguing
about
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
wouldn't
use
that
particular
rhetoric
in
describing
it,
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
desirable,
and
i
hope
to
show
in
my
argument--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that...
that
would
be
an
alternative
line
of
analysis
that
three
justices
have
employed
in
dissent
in
line
with
sanders.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
my...
as
i
analyze
the
case,
i
think
it
is
logically
prior
to
decide
whether
the
container
is
a
kind
that
is
generally
entitled
to
the
warrant
protection
before
deciding
whether
the
fact
that
it
is
found
in
the
course
of
an
automobile
search
justifies
a
warrantless
search,
and
i
think
the
reason
why
i
take
that
position
is
because
in
my
view
the
outcome
of
the
automobile
search
issue
might
very
well
depend
on
the
outcome
of
the
other
issue.
if
the
court's
conclusion
were
that
only
a
small
category
of
containers,
to
wit,
luggage,
attached
cases,
containers
inevitably
associated
with
an
expectation
of
privacy,
have
the
protection
of
the
warrant
clause
if
they
are
found
on
a
sidewalk
or
a
park
bench
or
a
restaurant
table
or
some
place
like
that,
then
that
seems
to
me
that
it
would
affect
the
analysis
of
the
automobile
search
issue,
because
it
could
be
argued
that
those
items
have
substantially
greater
privacy
protection
than
the
automobile
itself,
and
there
would...
against
that
framework,
there
would
be
some
logical
basis
for
refusing
to
apply
the
automobile
search
exception.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
i
take
it
the
rule
as
to
searching
that
closed
container
would
be
the
same
whether
it
was
located
in
the
glove
compartment
or
the
trunk.
i
must
say
that...
that
justices
blackmun
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
view
belton
as
presenting
a
completely
different
issue,
because
the
search
there
is
not
justified
by
probable
cause.
that
is
not
the
substantive
justification
for
the
search,
and
therefore
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
sheds
light
on
the
appropriate
rule
when
you
are
not
dealing
with
a
search
incident
but
an
investigative
search
which
must
be
justified
by
some
quantum
of
particular
suspicion--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
he
was
placed
under
arrest,
and
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
but
we
are
not
arguing
that
this
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
you
would
have--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--after
we
have
a
warrant,
under
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
if
you
have--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--at
least
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
seize
it,
you
do.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
this
was
found
in
the
locked
trunk
of
an
automobile--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
not
within
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that...
that
varies
from
place
to
place,
and
i
don't
know--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
for
opening
it
there,
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--all
right.
i
was
going
to
get
to
this
a
little
later,
because
of
the
way
my
analysis
was
structured,
but
i
think
even
if
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
interests
of
the
suspect,
there
are
reasons
for
preferring
an
on
the
spot
probable
cause
search
to
taking
it
and
getting
a
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no,
we
are
not...
we
are
not
attempting
to
justify--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
let
me
ask
you...
i
don't
mean
to
ask
you
a
question,
but
let
my
hypothesize
that
in
this
case
the
informant
was
mistaken,
and
that
the
bag
in
fact
contained
no
heroin--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--or
that
we
had
the
wrong
car.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this...
this
is
what
the
court
said
in--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
am
not
sure
how
to
respond
to
that
point,
but
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
of
course.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
question
before
the
court
is
the
appropriateness
of
having
a
prophylactic
procedure
of
a
warrant
application
before
the
officer
can
look
into
that
paper
bag
and
see
whether
the
man
was
violating
the
law
or
not,
and
i
would
like
to
say--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that
is
right.
if
there
were
an
inventory
search
procedure,
there
are
two
things.
one
is,
it
is
not
clear
that
it
would
apply
to
containers
found
in
an
automobile.
that
is
a
disputed
and
unsettled
issue.
and
the
second
thing
is
that
it's
not
clear
that
you
couldn't
conduct
the
inventory
on
the
spot.
we
are
not
relying
on
an
inventory
rationale
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
an
investigative
search
can
be
undertaken
on
probable
cause.
but
i
do
want
to
make
the
point,
you
say
he
can
just
consent
to
their
looking
in
the
bag
if
he
is
innocent,
and
that
is
what
the
court
suggested
in
the
footnote
in
sanders,
and
it
has
been
suggested
elsewhere,
but
if
you
were
the
chief
of
police
or
the
united
states
attorney,
and
you
were
instructing
your
agents
on
what
to
do
in
an
important
case
when
they
had
seized
a
container
that
they
believed,
let's
say,
had
20
pounds
of
cocaine
in
it,
whether
or
not
to
accept
the
consent,
i
think
you
would
be
most
hesitant
before
telling
them
to
accept
a
consent,
because
if
it
does
have
the
cocaine
in
it,
you
can
be
sure
that
in
95
percent
of
those
cases
you
are
going
to
have
a
suppression
hearing
in
which
the
defendant
will
be
claiming
that
he
didn't
consent,
you
will
be
taking
a
risk
that
the
district
court
will
agree
with
that
finding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
sure
did.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
complaining
about
the
risk
of
losing
the
evidence,
and
i
am
saying
that
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
mean
losing
it
physically,
i
mean
losing
its
use
in
court
as
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
a
difference,
but
i...
i
have
to
say
that
in
applying
the
cost
benefit
analysis,
the
difference
in
cost
between
two
to
four
hours
of
a
couple
of
officers
being
off
the
street
getting
a
warrant
and
possibly
eight
hours
or
longer
is
not
all
that
great.
in
my
view,
in
either
case
the
costs
of
a
warrant
requirement
are
substantial.
now,
if
you
are
searching
a
house,
i
don't
question
for
a
moment
that
they
are
justified,
but
we
are
talking
about
searching
a
paper
bag,
and
so
while
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
some
difference,
i
don't
think
that
difference
is
material
to
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
an
important...
that
is
part
of
our
argument,
or
in
a
sense
the
lynchpin
of
our
argument
in
terms
of
looking
at
precedent,
which
is
that
the
court
has...
in
the
past,
the
results
that
the
court
has
reached
have
been
dependent
on
the
court's
evaluation
of
the
magnitude
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
area
that
is
to
be
searched.
in
automobiles,
as
the
court
explained
in
chadwick,
in
contrasting
automobiles
to
luggage,
the
privacy
interest
is
significantly
less
in
automobiles
than
in
luggage,
and
that
is
why
the
court
held
that
a
warrant
is
required
for
luggage
and
not
for
automobiles.
so,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
question
before
you
can
impose
a
warrant
requirement
on
containers
is
whether
there
is
any
substantial
basis
for
saying
that
a
container
is
more
private
than
the
locked
glove
compartment
of
a
car
or
the
trunk
of
a
car.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
would
be
relevant
in
search
incident
cases,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
relevant
in
investigative
search
cases,
because
the
court's
rules
clearly
allow
a
full
search
of
all
portions
of
the
car,
so
whether
you
had
a
hatchback,
a
station
wagon,
or
a
conventional
sedan
with
a
closed
trunk,
the
rule
still
is
that
you
don't
need
a
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
belton,
the
limit
of
the
search
is
the
area
within
the
reach
of
the
arrested
individual
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
which
was
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree.
but
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
think
of
a
case.
as
i
say,
i
think
it
is
relevant
in
terms
of
the
permissible
scope
of
search
incident
to
arrest,
but
if
we
are
talking
about
an
investigative
search
on
probable
cause,
and
whether
a
warrant
is
required,
after
all,
for
a
search
incident
you
don't
need
probable
cause.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
the
warrant
requirement
has
nothing
to
do
with
search
incident
to
arrest.
in
any
event,
let
me
get
back
briefly
to
the
benefits
of
the
warrant
procedure,
because
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
have
in
mind
the
limited
extent
to
which
those
benefits
apply
to
searches
of
insubstantial
or
low
privacy
containers.
in
addition
to
the
particularly
benefit
there
is
also
the
notice
benefit.
that
is,
the
warrant
provides
notice
to
the
person
whose
property
is
being
searched
that
the
search
has
been
judicially
authorized.
again,
in
the
case
of
the
container
search,
the
search
on
the
spot
is
the
only
one
that
the
defendant
is
likely
to
observe.
otherwise,
he
is
going
to
be
locked
away
in
a
cell,
and
the
search
won't
even
take
place
in
his
presence,
and
the
notice
function
is
a
pretty
insubstantial
function
in
the
context
of
container
searches.
now,
there
is
a
third
function,
and
it
is,
i
think,
the
most
important
one,
and
the
only
one
that
is
relevant
here,
and
that
is
that
when
the
warrant
procedure
is
working
properly,
it
will
guard
against
unjustified
searches
by
overzealous
police
officers
who
mistakenly
believe
they
possess
probable
cause.
the
value
of
this
benefit,
i
submit,
is
inescapably
tied
to
the
privacy
interest
that
is
generally
associated
with
the
thing
or
the
place
to
be
searched.
in
those
areas
where
society
attaches
high
privacy
value,
the
home
or
office,
mail,
telephone
communications,
the
damage
to
fourth
amendment
interests
caused
by
an
unjustified
search
are
high,
and
accordingly
the
prophylaxis
of
the
warrant
procedure,
if
it
succeeds
in
preventing
even
a
few
unjustified
searches,
is
well
worth
its
cost.
but,
i
repeat,
the
value
of
the
warrant
requirement
here
is
solely
a
product
of
the
costs
associated
with
the
unjustified
search
which
is
going
to
be
prevented.
if
the
search
is
of
an
area
that
is
unlikely
to
contain
anything
very
private,
the
costs
of
a
mistake
in
the
search
are
dramatically
reduced.
for
example,
in
robbins,
if
the
officer
had
been
mistaken
in
believing
that
the
parcel
contained
marijuana
bricks,
and
instead
had
found
that
it
contained
highway
flares,
as
one
judge
suggested
it
looked
like,
the
costs
of
the
officer
seeing
the
highway
flares
in
terms
of
an
invasion
on
robbins'
personal
privacy
would
have
been
relatively
slight.
this
is
also
true
in
cases
involving,
for
instance,
burlap
bags
full
of
marijuana,
which
might
turn
out
to
contain
straw
if
the
officer
is
mistaken,
and
generally
in
cases
of
containers,
grocery
bags
and
other
things
that
don't
ordinarily
contain
highly
private
items.
now,
against
these
very
limited
benefits
when
we
are
talking
about
container
searches,
we
have
to
weigh
the
costs
in
terms
of
two
respects.
one
is
the
governmental
resources
consumed
in
the
warrant
procedure,
and
again,
i...
it
is
very
easy
to
pooh-pooh,
as
the
aclu
has
done
in
its
amicus
brief,
the
costs
of
the
warrant
procedure
as
though
they
were
a
moderate
convenience,
like
having
a
remote
control
to
turn
on
and
off
your
television
set,
but
it
is
hardly
a
matter
of
that
nature.
it
is
a
matter
of
taking
working
law
enforcement
officers
away
from
their
other
duties
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
while
they
get
a
warrant,
and
i
think
it
is
the
duty
of
this
court
not
to
require
those
kinds
of
procedures
unless
it
is
satisfied
that
some
substantial
protection
of
fourth
amendment
interests
is
going
to
be
derived
from
it.
the
second
is
the
point
that
i
have
already
discussed
with
justice
marshall,
which
is
even
the
interests
of
the
innocent
suspect
are
not
well
guarded
by
this
rule,
because
that
individual
may
be
subject
to
a
custodial
arrest
lasting
some
hours
before
the
magistrate
decides
there
is
not
probable
cause
and
orders
him
released,
and
i
suspect
that,
to
use
the
greater
intrusion,
lesser
intrusion
analogy,
most
people
would
vastly
prefer
an
immediate
search
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
low
privacy
container
than
they
would
the
alternative
of
arrest,
seizure,
warrant
procedure,
and
so
on.
now,
in
view
of
the
time,
i
think
i
will
sit
down
now
if
there
are
no
further
questions
and
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
justice
stevens
asked
my
colleague
about
lifting
up
a
blanket
that
might
be
covering
some
items
in
the
back
of
the
car,
and
i
think
this
touches
upon
the
point
which,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
is
the
only
substantive
argument
of
policy
advanced
for
requiring
warrants
for
searching
insubstantial
containers,
and
that
is
the
bright
line
test,
argument.
now,
we
submit
that
the
bright
line
argument
that
if
you
require
a
warrant
for
all
containers
officers
will
know
what
they
have
to
do
is
faulty
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
your
power
is
only
to
prohibit
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
there
is
a
limit
to
the
extent
to
which
you
can
characterize
reasonable
searches
as
unreasonable
for
purposes
of
applying
a
bright
line
test.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
illusory
to
suppose
that
you
will
have
a
bright
line
test
by
the
all
container
rule
suggested
in
the
robbins
plurality,
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
since
there
is
enormous
room
for
confusion,
as
your
question
pointed
out,
over
what
constitutes
a
container.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
things
that
we
would
like
you
to
do,
and
i
believe
that
is
open,
and
i
do
disagree,
the
government
does
disagree
with
the
views
expressed
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
robbins.
we
do
agree
with
justice
powell's
analytical
framework,
although
not
with
his
actual
application
of
his
analysis
to
the
facts
of
robbins.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that...
that
was
the
point
that
i
was
coming
to.
our
position
is,
of
course,
that
if
you
do
need
a
bright
line,
then
in
the
context
of
an
automobile
it
is
unquestionable
that
the
bright
line
is...
is
supplied
by
the
rule
that
you
may
search
containers
within
an
automobile
instead
of
trying
to
decide
whether
something
is
a
container
or
is
not.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
a
first
circuit
case
that
held
a
rolled
up
raincoat
from
which
a
walkie-talkie
fell
out
when
it
was
unrolled
was
a
container.
pockets
of
clothing,
pillow
cases
stuffed
with
stolen
goods,
shopping
bags
open
at
the
top
but
not
revealing
to
plain
view
all
of
their
contents.
all
you
are
going
to
do
is
shift
the
area
of
uncertainty.
you
are
not
going
to
relieve
any
uncertainty,
and
in
fact,
the
post-chadwick
experience
in
dealing
with
the
expectation
of
privacy
analysis
has
shown
very
little
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
courts
between
discerning
what
kinds
of
containers
have
high
privacy
attributes
and
require
the
additional
prophylaxis
of
a
warrant
requirement
to
protect
privacy
interests
and
what
kinds
of
containers
don't.
now,
i
wanted
to
make
a
point
briefly
about
telephonic
warrants,
because
that
was
raised.
telephonic
warrants
are
to
be
used
only
in
extraordinary
circumstances.
the
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
and
i
think
the
policy
under
the
rule
is
that
it
is
only
to
be
used
in
cases
where
there
is
something
on
the
verge
of
exigent
circumstances.
it
is
normally
designed,
in
fact,
for
the
wyoming
kind
of
case,
where
the
magistrate
may
be
several
hundred
miles
away.
you
are
still
required
to
write
out
in
full
your
warrant
application,
and
then
read
it
over
the
phone
for
the
magistrate.
the
time
savings
from
a
telephonic
warrant
which,
as
i
say,
would
never
be
used
in
a
case
like
this,
are
in
fact
very
slight.
now,
i
think
that
my
colleague
has
been
put
in
a
position
of
essentially
arguing
for
overruling
the
automobile
search
exception,
because
i
think
he
implicitly
acknowledges
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
automobiles
can
be
searched
as
a
matter
of
expectation
of
privacy
analysis
without
a
warrant,
but
containers
cannot
be
searched,
and
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
and
chadwick
says
so
explicitly,
that
the
automobile
search
exception
is
not
based
on
exigency
that
occurs
at
the
time
the
item
is
searched.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
think
there
may
be
some
difference,
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
settled
that
whatever
that
difference
is,
it
is
not
dispositive
of
the
right
of
the
officers
to
make
a
warrantless
probable
cause
search
of
the
trunk.
i
think
there
is...
i
mean,
i
think
a
glove
compartment
is
probably
a
relatively
private
area
compared
to
many
kinds
of
containers
that
may
be
searched
which
may
be
governed
by
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
not
follow,
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not
saying
that
the
police
could
go
to
some
location
where
there
happened
to
be
a
number
of
paper
bags
in
the
luggage
room
and
start
just
looking
through
them.
that
is
not
the
point.
the
point
is
that
the
substantive
requirement
of
focused
reasonable
suspicion
in
these
cases
amounting
to
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
evidence
of
a
crime
is
the
critical
protection
of
the
privacy
interests
that
the
fourth
amendment
supplies,
and
in
this
context
it
is
an
ample
protection,
and
the
protection
of
the
warrant
clause
is
very,
very
slight
in
this
context.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
our...
our
principal
submission
is
that
the
result
should
be
the
same,
that
probable
cause
suffices
to
justify
searching--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--whether
it
is
found
in
a
car
or
wherever
it
is
found.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
wouldn't
say
just
the
lower
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
the
lifeblood
of
the
warrant
requirement
in
the
first
place.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely,
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
suitcase
is
inevitably
associated
with
expectation
of
privacy,
that
its
traditional--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
we
haven't
been
invited
to
overrule
them,
but
i
accept...
the
analysis
that
underlies
those
holdings
seems
to
be
legitimate,
although
one
might
be--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--whether
robbins
should
be
reconsidered.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
question
involves...
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
paper
bag
and
a
wrapped
and
sealed
container,
and
i
think
that
difference
was
dispositive,
at
least
to
justice
powell's
vote
in
robbins.
we
are
hoping
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--not
at
all.
not
at
all.
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
we
would...
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
if
the
court
wanted
to
reconsider
chadwick
and
sanders,
but
i
don't
think...
i
want
to
stress
that
chadwick
and
sanders
focused
on
the
question
of
whether
suitcases
and
luggage
are
the
kinds
of
items
that
require
the
protection
of
the
warrant
procedure,
it
looked
in
that
to
the
customary
uses
of
the
items,
their
structural
integrity,
and
the
value
that
society
attached
to
them,
and
it
made
a
conclusion
which
i
think
is
the
court's
job
to
make,
yea
or
nay,
that
these
have
sufficient
privacy
attributes
that
a
warrant
requirement
was
appropriate.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
for
purposes
of
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
in
this
case
we
are
not
suggesting
that
a
warrantless
search
of
either
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
under...
not
under
sanders,
no.
thank
you.
