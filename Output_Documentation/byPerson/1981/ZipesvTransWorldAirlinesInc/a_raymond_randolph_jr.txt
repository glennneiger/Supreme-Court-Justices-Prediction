mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
the
plaintiff
class
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
a
number
of
the
arguments
that
mr.
jolley
has
just
made
on
behalf
of
the
union
and
also
in
his
reply
brief,
and
then
address
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
raised
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
there
was
and
has
been
no
absence
of
union
participation
in
this
litigation
in
the
eleven-year
history
of
the
case.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
this
case
was
begun
by
the
union.
there
was
a
complaint
filed
by
the
union
after
the
union
brought
a
charge
before
the
eeoc
in
1970.
there
came
a
time,
three
years
after
the
litigation
was
under
way,
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
union
could
no
longer
represent
the
class
that
i
now
represent
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
but
the
union
was
not
ousted
from
the
litigation.
the
original
union
remained
in
this
case
until
1976
as
a
party,
participated
in
the
pleadings,
filed
motions
in
opposition
to
summary
judgment,
and
so
on
and
so
fort.
in
1976,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
that
the
original
union
had
become
defunct.
that
was
local
550
of
the
transport
workers
union,
af
of
l-cio.
the
court,
however,
allowed
without
prejudice
the
new
union,
local
551,
to
intervene.
that
order
was
entered
in
april
of
1976,
and
a
few
days
later
local
551
intervened,
and
so,
again,
from
1976
on,
the
union
was
participating
in
the
litigation.
in
april
of
1977,
this
union
came
into
being.
they
did
not,
however,
file
to
intervene
into
this
case.
and
they
did
not
come
into
the
case
until
july
of
1979,
before
the
settlement
agreement
was
approved
by
the
district
court.
one
might
speculate
about
why
during
an
eleven-year
history
of
this
case
there
were
two
years
when
this
union
was
in
existence
when
a
union
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation.
but
there
is
no
need
to
speculate,
because
the
union
explained
why
it
stayed
out
of
the
case
to
the
district
judge,
and
we
think
that
explanation
contradicts
a
good
many
of
the
things
not
only
that
mr.
jolley
has
just
said
to
this
court,
but
also
that
the
union
has
said
in
its
reply
brief.
there
is
a
document
entitled
supplemental
suggestions
of
intervenor
iffa
in
support
of
motion
to
intervene,
and
i
have
lodged
copies
of
this
document
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
and
they
are
available,
and
i
would
like
to
just
read
to
the
court
what
the
union
told
the
district
court.
'79...
"in
this
case
the
union
certainly
had
no
reason
to
intervene
prior
to
this
time.
"
"the
union
was
not
in
existence
for
the
first
seven
years
of
this
litigation.
"
"shortly
after
the
union
came
into
existence,
counsel
for
the
union
spoke
with
counsel
for
the
defendant
regarding
this
litigation,
and
it
was
mutually
agreed
that
no
purpose
would
be
served
by
the
union
intervening
at
that
time,
but
that
intervention
by
the
union
might
be
appropriate
if
and
when
the
case
ever
reached
the
remedy
stage.
"
so,
the
union
came
into
this
case
purposely
only
at
the
time
of
the
remedy,
and
the
union's
intervention
petition
was
aimed
at
two
arguments.
one,
that
the
district
court
should
not
exercise
jurisdiction
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
otherwise,
and
number
two,
that
the
seniority
award
would
have
an
adverse
impact,
an
unusual
adverse
impact.
mr.
jolley
in
his
argument
throughout
the
brief
has
referred
to
the
settlement
agreement
depriving
his
clients
of
their
rights.
the
settlement
agreement
did
not
do
that.
there
was
a
separate
seniority
award
entered
by
the
district
judge,
not
simply
after
the
union
made
objections,
but
after
a
three-month
hearing
on
the
matter
in
which
depositions
were
taken,
exhibits
were
introduced,
cross
examination
was
engaged
in,
and
arguments
were
made.
after
that
litigation
was
over,
with
twa
standing
aside,
is
the
point
at
which
the
seniority
award
was
made
by
the
district
court,
pursuant
to
section
706(g)
of
the
act,
which
provides
that
if
a
violation
is
found
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
remedy.
mr.
jolley
said
there
was
no
finding
of
violation
with
respect
to
subclass
b.
to
borrow
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
i
think
that
argument
is
syntactically
complex.
what
he
means
by
that
is
not
that
the
district
court
never
found
that
subclass
b
people
were
not
victims
of
a
title
7
violation,
because
the
district
court
did
so
find.
he
cannot
mean
that
the
district
court
found
no
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
did
so
find.
what
he
means
is
that
because
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court,
therefore
we
can
ignore
the
fact
that
there
was
a
violation
found,
and
to
make
it
plain,
and
now
i
would
like
to
address
the
jurisdictional
argument,
but
in
doing
so,
i
want
to--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
in
this
case,
the
case
reached
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
section
1292(b)
appeal,
an
interlocutory
appeal.
no
final
judgment
had
been
entered.
there
was
no
stay
of
the
district
court's
proceedings.
when
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
judgment,
there
was
a
stay
of
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
so
when
the
district
court
had
the
case
before
it
in
1979,
while
petitions
were
pending
here,
the
case
was
the
same
as
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
ruled,
and
we
made
the
point
in
our
brief
that
what
petitioners
are
really
arguing
is
that
the
district
judge
should
have
been
persuaded
by
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
a
mandate
compels
compliance.
it
does
not
compel
agreement,
and
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
had
been
stayed.
the
district
court...
if
the
district
court
was
not
persuaded
by
it,
and
the
district
court
was
not,
the
district
court
was
free,
in
fact,
even
without
the
settlement
agreement
in
this
case,
the
posture
of
the
case
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
only
question
remaining
was
remedy.
there
was
a
summary
judgment
for
all
members
of
the
class.
there
was
a
finding
of
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
could
have
proceeded
to
the
remedy
stage
without
a
settlement,
and
ordered
retroactive
seniority
relief
as
the
court
ultimately
did.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
if
the
district
court
has
dismissed
the
complaint,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed,
and
no
mandate
has
come
down
yet,
i
think
the
district
court
is
not...
can
be
guided
by
the
opinion,
but
is
not
bound
to
reinstate
the
complaint
until
the
mandate
issues.
the
question
that
i
am
about
to
address
is,
we
think,
the
heart
of
the
union's
argument
in
this
case,
which
is
jurisdictional.
although
the
union
talks
about
lack
of
violation,
they
mean
jurisdiction.
although
they
talk
about
lack
of
jurisdiction,
what
they
really
mean
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
mr.
jolley's
statement
to
the
court
of
appeals...
or
to
the
district
court.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
it
should
be
at
volume
2,
page
19.
it
is
the
sentence
that
begins
after
the
sentence
ending
at
the
top.
he
said,
"if
it"...
the
supreme
court...
"does
grant
cert
and
reverses
the
seventh
circuit,
as
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
do,
then
i
think
our
position
is
basically.
"
and
this
is
the
union's
position,
"to
be
heard
on
the
basis
of
seniority
alone,
and
to
try
to
show
the
court
there
would
be
a
serious
adverse
impact
which
would
be
within
the
court's
discretion.
"
now,
the
court,
of
course,
has
granted
certiorari.
the
question
about
whether
the
particular
remedy
in
this
case
is
appropriate
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case,
because
the
court
denied
certiorari
with
respect
to
the
union's
last
question
presented
in
its
petition
which
dealt
with
that,
and
the
question
that
remains,
we
submit,
is
the
question
that
we
have
addressed
in
our
brief
and
that
the
solicitor
general
has
addressed
in
its
brief
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
and
that
question
arises
because,
as
mr.
jolley
correctly
states,
with
respect
to
some,
and
what
the
percentage
is,
i
believe,
is
probably
about
90
percent
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
their
complaint
was
not
filed
within...
their
charge
with
the
eeoc
was
not
filed
within
90
days
of
the
time
that
they
were
terminated
for
becoming
mothers.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed,
as
i
said,
by
the
union,
and
after
the
union
filed
the
complaint,
twa
answered.
the
answer
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
8a.
twa's
answer
admitted
jurisdiction,
raised
two
affirmative
defenses,
neither
of
which
were
statute
of
limitations.
two
years
later,
and
this
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
54a,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
at
twa's
behest.
that
order,
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
on
54a,
found
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
all
members
of
the
plaintiff
class.
that
order
was
pursuant
to
a
settlement
that
twa
had
worked
out
with
the
prior
union,
which
was
ultimately
set
aside,
as
i
mentioned
before.
the
case
wound
its
way
on,
and
four
years
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
twa
made
a
motion
to
amend
their
answer.
they
claim
now
that
the
plaintiff's
complaint
can
be
defended
on
the
basis
that
there
was...
that
they
failed
to
comply
with
the
"statute
of
limitations".
the
district
court
granted
twa
leave
to
amend,
but
cautioned
that
twa
was
going
to
be
required
to
show
that
its
delay
and
failure
to
raise
this
defense
for
four
years
was
excusable,
and
that
the
plaintiff
suffered
no
prejudice
as
a
result
of
that.
five
years
after
the
lawsuit
began,
twa
appeared
in
district
court
in
1975,
and
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
raised
the
question
whether
this
was
jurisdictional.
former
section
706(d).
twa
argued
that
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
charge
filing
provisions
of
title
7
was
a
jurisdictional
defect,
and
since
it
is
jurisdictional,
twa
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
ancient
maxim
that
any
party
at
any
time
in
the
litigation
can
raise
a
jurisdictional
problem.
the
district
court
asked
how
in
the
world
a
motion
like
this
can
be
filed
five
years
after
the
lawsuit
began,
but
i
guess
i
have
no
choice,
because
you
are
raising
a
jurisdictional
question.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
district
court
rejected
twa's
argument
about
jurisdiction,
found
a
continuing
violation,
entered
summary
judgment
for
subclass
b.
those
two
findings,
summary
judgment
and
continuing
violation,
were
the
subject
of
1292(b)
interlocutory
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
1978
that
in
fact
the
time
limits
were
jurisdictional,
and
we
petitioned
for
certiorari,
and
the
court
has
granted
our
petition.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
district
court--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
doubtful
that
it
was
a
waiver.
i
think
the--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--yes.
i
don't
believe
that
is
accurate,
justice
white.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
because
the
district
court
did
not
have
to
so
find.
once
having
found
a
continuing
violation,
justice
brennan,
there
was
no
need
to
consider
whether
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
so
there
was
no
finding
in
that
respect.
the
district
court's--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--we
think
that
that
is
the
only
thing
that
twa
in
fact
waived
in
this
case,
is
their
right
to
further
litigate
the
question
whether
they
waived
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
is
what
they
gave
up
through
the
settlement,
from
our
point
of
view.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
they
say...
for
the
first
time,
i
think,
in
this
litigation,
the
union
has
said
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
defense,
even
if
twa
has
waived
it,
and
our
answer
to
that
is,
number
one,
their
petition
for
intervention
under
rule
24(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
is
supposed
to
state
all
of
their
claims
or
their
defenses,
and
if
the
court
reviews
that...
it
is
in
the
appendix...
you
will
find
no
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
their
claim
is
entirely
jurisdictional,
justice
brennan.
they
cannot
say
that
there
was
no
violation,
no
finding
of
violation,
unless
they
make
a
jurisdictional
argument.
the
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
extinguish
the
claim.
they
are
saying
that
failure
to
comply
with
a
jurisdictional
defect
does
extinguish
the
claim.
it
is
the
only
way
they
can
make
that
argument.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
have
a
few
minutes
left.
i
think
we
are
in
good
company
in
making
this
argument.
the
eeoc
and
the
united
states
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
that
basically
support
or
we
support
their
construction,
one
way
or
the
other.
twenty-five
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
case
we
relied
upon...
it
is
an
opinion
by
judge
anderson
and
i
commend
it
to
the
court...
in
coke
joined
in
holding
that
this
particular
provision,
the
90-day
charge,
was
not
jurisdictional.
i
guess
we
can
call...
take
credit
also
for
the
eleventh
circuit
now,
because
that
was
rendered
before
those
two
circuits
split,
and
every
judge
sitting
in
those
circuits
has
agreed.
in
fact,
every
circuit...
our
review
and
the
solicitor
general's
review
indicates
that
every
circuit
court
that
has
considered
this
question
agrees
that
the
9-day
charge
filing
provision
with
the
eeoc
is
not
jurisdictional
except
the
seventh,
and
this
is
the
only
case
representing
a
position
of
a
court
of
appeals
now
that
takes
that
position.
we
argue
on
the
basis
of
statutory
interpretation.
this
is
in
essence
a
question
of
what
congress
intended.
and
following
the
usual
course,
one
looks
first
at
what
the
statute
says.
the
section
dealing
with
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
simply
says,
each
u.
s.
district
court
shall
have
jurisdictions
of
actions
brought
under
this
subchapter.
there
is
no
qualification
in
that
section,
the
section
706.
there
are
no
conditions.
there
is
no
cross-reference
to
any
other
provision.
the
charge
filing
provision
that
is
at
issue
here
deals
with
the
time
for
filing
a
charge
with
the
eeoc,
not
the
time
for
filing
a
charge
with
the
court.
it
is
a
separate
provision.
one
thing
that
is
clear,
and
the
court's
prior
opinions
have
so
said...
franks
has
been
mentioned,
albermarle
paper
company
versus
moody,
and
a
number
of
other
cases...
that
the
remedial
provisions
of
title
7
were
modeled
after
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
the
close
provision
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
former
section
706(d)
of
title
7,
that
we
are
dealing
with
now,
has
language
similar
to
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
it
provides
that
complaints
have
to
be
filed
within
six
months
with
the
nlrb,
and
the
courts
have
uniformly,
without
exception,
construed
that
provision
to
be
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations,
subject
to
equitable
modification.
there
are
statements
of
members
of
congress
on
the
floor
in
1964
to
the
effect
that
what
they
were
designing
by
this
provision
is
a
period
of
limitations.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
this
is
a...
this,
i
think...
this
suit
is
analogous
to
a
suit
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
a
make
whole
remedy,
and
i
think
congress
so
considered
that
as
the
proper
analogy,
justice
rehnquist,
and
whether
it
should
be
called
a
statute
of
limitations
or
some
other
term
subject
to
equitable
modification
i
don't
think
is
the
significant
point.
i
would
point
out,
however,
that
the
committee
reports,
when
this
section
was
amended
in
1972,
and
extended
to
180
days,
in
fact
called
it
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
suppose.
but
i
notice
that
twa
has
taken
us
to
task
because
they
said
that
the
nlra
is
not
a
good
analogy.
our
only
point
here
is,
we
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
and
the
important
thing
is
what
congress's
analogy
was,
and
if
you
look
at
page
27
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
that,
for
example,
the
house...
the
minority
view
of
the
house
labor
committee
called
the
filing
period
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
said
it
was
identical
to
the
statute
of
limitations
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
the
senate
labor
committee
section
by
section
analysis
basically
said
the
same
thing.
the
opinions
of
this
court,
we
think--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
that
was
amended
in
1978.
the
court
in
coke
mentioned
that.
there
was
a
case
in
this
court,
i
believe,
called
dart,
where
the
court
evenly
split,
and
whether
it
was
over
that
issue
i
don't
know,
but
that
act
is
modeled
after
title
7,
and
in
coke,
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
that
congress
made
clear
in
amendments
to
the
age
act
in
1978
that
they
did
not
want
this
time
filing
provision
to
be
construed
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
but
rather
as
a
statute
of
limitations.
there
are
other--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--pardon
me.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
so
stated
explicitly.
explicitly.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
and
the
reasons
for
that,
i
think,
are
fairly
certain.
there
is
no
reason
for
construing
this
as
a
jurisdictional
matter.
i
think
there
was
no
policy
reason.
a
statute
of
limitations
provides
a
defense
if
it
is
invoked,
and
would
defeat
a
claim
if
it
were
invoked
by
an
employer.
our
point
here
is,
number
one,
it
is
not
invoked
as
an
affirmative
defense.
for
five
years
this
case
went
on
and
it
was
not
invoked.
twa
was
given
leave
to
amend,
but
only
on
condition
that
they
justify
their
failure,
and
then
the
case
was
settled,
and
i
might
say,
since
my
time
is
up--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--yes,
we
have
not
raised
that
as
an
issue.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
have
to
qualify
my
statement.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
a
continuing
violation
with
respect
to
some
members
of
the
class,
the
ones
that
became
mothers
between
july
2nd,
1965,
and
march
of
1970,
but
then
got
rehired.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
we
have
not
raised
that
issue.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
we
rest
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
