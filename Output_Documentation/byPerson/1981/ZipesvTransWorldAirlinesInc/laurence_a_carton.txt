mr.
laurence
a.
carton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
just
two
matters
that
i
wanted
to
dispose
of
on
this
question
of
jurisdiction.
one
was
mr.
rehnquist's
point,
and
i
just
wanted
to
read
from
our
brief,
"the
nlra
does
not
contain
any
preliminary
requirements
like
the
state
and
eeoc
proceedings,
without
which
title
7
could
not
have
been
enacted.
"
secondly,
as
far
as
the
1972
amendment,
the
1972
amendments
which
brought
in
the
180
days
were
applicable
only
to
charges
pending
with
the
commission
on
the
date
of
enactment,
and
all
charges
filed
thereafter.
the
two
previous
speakers
really
have
not
touched
upon
the
matter
that
is
most
important
as
far
as
twa
is
concerned.
twa
is
interested
in
the
settlement
that
will
end
this
litigation.
it
is
not
involved
in
the
seniority
dispute
between
reinstated
employees
and
current
employees.
twa--
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
--i
am
not
sure,
justice
white.
i
feel
that
the
settlement
agreement
can
be
approved--
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
--that
is
right.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
that
is
right.
twa
stopped
the
practice
two
months
after
the
complaint
was
filed.
one
year
later,
it
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
under
rule
23(e).
a
similar
settlement
was
entered
into
with
american
airlines
and
the
union,
and
both
of
these
settlements
were
turned
down
by
the
court
of
appeals,
primarily
on
the
issue
of
the
failure
to
grant
retroactive
seniority.
so,
then
we
go
back
to
the
district
court,
and
we
have
two
years
of
discovery,
and
the
district
court,
as
has
been
discussed,
hands
down
a
judgment
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
so
first
american
airlines,
we
have
a
settlement
agreement
negotiated.
the
settlement
agreement
is
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
certiorari
is
denied
by
this
court.
so,
twa
is
beginning
to
feel
that
we
are
getting
somewhere.
so,
we
go
ahead
and
negotiate
basically
the
same
agreement
as
the
american
agreement
two
years
later.
the
union
intervenes,
just
the
way
they
did
in
the
american
case.
we
have
the
hearings
before
the
district
court.
this
time
we
want
to
be
even
more
careful,
so
we
don't
just
have
one
order
involving
both
seniority
and
the
settlement
agreement,
we
have
two
orders,
a
settlement
agreement
order
and
a
second
order
in
which
the
court
grants
retroactive
seniority
as
he
was
authorized
to
do
under
the
settlement
agreement.
and
as
you
all
know,
the
matter
goes
on,
and
is
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
feel
we
are
home
free.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
that
is
correct.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
but
even...
even
in
the
proceeding,
justice
white,
in
the
american
case,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
brought
up,
and
the
court
of
appeals
approved
this
settlement
regardless
of
the
question
and
cert
was
denied.
now,
if
the
settlement
order
is
approved
here,
the--
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
--our
position
on
the
jurisdiction
case,
justice
brennan,
is,
as
was
said
earlier,
92
percent
of
these
class
members
didn't,
as
the
testimony
indicated,
lift
a
finger.
what
brought
this
into
the
courts
was
a
charge
filed
in
june
of
1970
by
the
union.
they
didn't
do
anything,
and
our
feeling
is
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
title
7,
whether
you
label
those
requirements
as
statute
of
limitations
or
as
jurisdictional
prerequisites
or
even
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
but
as
far
as
the...
as
far
as
the
settlement
is
concerned,
our
feeling
is
that
there
is...
there
is
some
advantage
to
the
condition
precedent
idea
which
we
have
suggested,
which
was,
incidentally,
the
term
used
in
the
coke
case.
we
feel
that
if
there
was
a
violation
on
the
part
of
all
of
these
92
percent
by
not
filing
their
charges,
that
these
people
are
in
a
situation
where
the
settlement
is
fair
as
far
as
they
are
concerned.
we
also
feel,
getting
back
to
this
jurisdiction
question,
that
there
was
not
a
final
order
on
the
part
of
the
courts
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
back
in--
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
--we
are
somewhat
relaxed
about
the
thing,
judge,
justice,
because
it
isn't
necessary--
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
--we
want
the--
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
--that
is
right,
justice
white.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
that
is
exactly
the
way
we
feel,
and
we
feel
that--
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
--our
feeling
doesn't
really,
i
think,
matter.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
we
have
tried
all
along
to
do
what
is
best
for
twa.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
but
the
point
still
is
that
we
made
this
settlement
because
we
didn't
know
what
was
going
to
happen
at
a
proceeding
such
as
we
are
having
now,
and
we
felt...
we
felt
that
we
should
go
ahead
and
make
the
settlement.
we
were
not
very
much
concerned
about
the
powers
of
the
district
court,
because
we
felt
that,
as
i
said
before,
the
case
was
not
final,
and
so
here
we
are.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
could,
to
get
into
one
area
which
we
think
is
very
important
to
our
case,
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
is
in
a
situation
here,
we
think,
where
it
can
under
the
ancient
rules
of
equity
come
down
and
handle
this
retroactive
seniority
issue.
it
can
handle
it
under
706(g).
it
can
handle
it
under
its
broad
powers
of
equity.
i
noticed
a
case
that
i
am
sure
that
you
are
familiar
with,
the
swann
case
on
busing,
where
they
had
a
quotation,
"the
essence
of
equity
jurisdiction
has
been
the
power
of
the
chancellor
to
do
equity
and
to
mold
each
decree
to
the
necessities
of
the
particular
case.
"
"flexibility
rather
than
rigidity
has
distinguished
it.
"
"the
qualities
of
mercy
and
practicality
have
made
equity
the
instrument
for
nice
adjustment
and
reconciliation
between
the
public
interest
and
private
needs
as
well
as
between
competing
private
claims.
"
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
settlement
agreement,
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
seniority
order
have
been
confused.
i
think
that
the
relationship...
they
are
intermingled,
and
i
don't
think
they
should
be.
i
think
there
are
two
separate
orders,
and
what
i
am
trying
to
say
by
quoting
regarding
the
powers
of
a
court
of
equity
is
that
a
court
of
equity
in
a
situation
like
this
has
the
power
to
come
in
here
and
finalize
in
a
comprehensive
way
all
of
these
complications
that
have
grown
up
over
eleven
years
of
litigation
so
that
these
women
can
go
back
to
work.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
yes,
sir.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
no,
we
have
a
plan
for
you.
mr.
laurence
a.
carton
well,
i
hope
this
case
doesn't
turn
into
jarndeis
versus
jarndeis.
it
has
only
gone
on
for
eleven
years.
but
the
idea
that
we
still
have
is
that
the
court
is
now
in
a
position
here
to,
by
approving
the
settlement
agreement,
this
will
then,
under
the
court's
usual
practice,
make
moot
the
other
two
cases,
and
that
is
the
end
of
it.
and
that
is
what
we
would
like.
