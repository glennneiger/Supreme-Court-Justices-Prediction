unknown
speaker
counsel,
what
do
you
think
the
seventh
circuit's
definition
of
a
"continuing
violation"
is?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to...
you
are
going
to
get
to
the
jurisdictional
matter,
the
time
matter?
or
are
you
arguing
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
that
it
was
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
and
then
held
also
that
the
district
court
could
not
enter
a
settlement
with
respect
to
92
percent
of
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
even
get
to
your
issue
if
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
decided
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
you
go
your
own
way,
but
you
are
just
going
to
leave
us
on
our
own?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
well,
you
go
ahead
and
argue
your
case
the
way
you
want
to.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jolley,
will
you
agree
that
the
agreement
as
to
subclass
a
also
overrode
the
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
is
the
union
failing
to
object
to
the
portion
of
the
agreement
which
applies
to
subclass
a?
unknown
speaker
would
you
also
agree
that
the
seniority
system
itself
really
was
not
affected
by
the
settlement
agreement?
it
was
a
question
of
who
was
plugged
in
where,
but
it
didn't
change
the
seniority
system
itself.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
while
i
have
you
responding
right
now,
and
that
is
whether
iffa
is
not
bound
by
the
actions
of
the
union
which
did
represent
the
plaintiffs
when
the
action
was
filed.
unknown
speaker
and
if
not,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
claim
that
iffa
isn't
bound
by
title
7,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
class
a?
was
there
a
finding
of
violation
with
respect
to
them?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
how
about
a?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that
wasn't
granted,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
what?
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
was
deferred.
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
but
if
that
were...
if
that
finding
of...
where
do
you
stand
if
that
finding
of
violation
is
left
standing?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
there
is
a
finding
of
violation.
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
district
court
find?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
subclass
b.
did
the
district
court
find
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
with
respect
to
the
entire
class.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
entire
class.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jolley,
to
what
extent
did
iffa
take
part
in
the
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
settlement?
unknown
speaker
after
the
settlement?
unknown
speaker
this
was
after
the
settlement?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
made
the
same
arguments
then
that
you
are
making
here
today.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jolley,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question
before
you
do?
is
there
a
necessary
conflict
between
employees
currently
represented
in
an
employment
situation
and
others
such
as
the
ones
who
were
formerly
discharged
who
want
rightful
place
relief?
unknown
speaker
mr.
randolph,
ordinarily
when
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
the
district
court,
the
district
court's
findings
are
overturned,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
the
district
court
dismisses
the
complaint,
the
court
of
appeals
orders
it
reinstated,
that
the
district
court
may
simply
refuse
to
continue
litigation
on
that
complaint
because
the
mandate
has
been
stayed
of
the
court
of
appeals,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
ever
find
there
had
been
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
and
assuming
it
was
not
jurisdictional,
they
hadn't
complied
with
the
time
limit.
did
the
district
court
ever
rule
on
that,
or
did
the
court
of
appeals
just
say
it
is
doubtful
if
there
was
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
i
understood
your
colleague
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding
that
the
settlement
agreement
itself
constituted
a
waiver?
that
the
time
deficiencies
were
not
jurisdictional,
but
merely
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
any
argument
that
if
this
is
statute
of
limitations,
that
the
settlement
did
constitute
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
the
adversary
petitioner
who
just
argued
to
take
the
position
that
even
if
this
was
a
statute
of
limitations
and
not
jurisdictional,
that
nevertheless
the
settlement
is
invalid?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
that
in
saying
that
the
settlement
is
invalid,
they
are
really
arguing
that
it
is
only
because
it
is
time
barred.
is
that
it?
even
if
it
is
statute
of
limitations
and
not
jurisdictional?
unknown
speaker
you
still
have
to
argue
the
jurisdictional--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
the
statute
of
limitations
governed
actions
at
law,
and
that
equitable
modification
would
deal
with
the
latches.
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
term
you
ordinarily
use
for
an
action
at
law.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
randolph--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
getting
any
comfort
out
of
the
180-day
limitation
and
the
age
discrimination
act?
unknown
speaker
it
said
that
explicitly,
i
gather,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
didn't
one
of
the
reports
so
state
explicitly?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
do
we
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
continuing
violation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
we
say
that
the
statute
of
limitations
matter
then
is
of
critical
importance?
unknown
speaker
to
the
extent
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
district
court,
you
have
not...
that
issue
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
avoid
being
involved
in
it,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what
if...
if
we
say
the
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
approve
the
settlement
with
respect
to
90
percent
of
the
class,
you
can't
avoid
being
affected.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
i
meant.
unknown
speaker
you
sound
very
innocent
in
the
whole
thing--
0
[generallaughter.]
--but
you
are
the
ones
who
brought
the
jurisdictional
issue
up
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
fly
in
the
ointment...
that
got
the
case
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask,
mr.
carton,
what
is
your
position
now
on
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
but
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
settlement
agreement,
it
does
make
a
difference,
doesn't
it,
whether
this
is
merely
time...
these
are
merely
time
barred
claims
or
whether
they
are
jurisdictionally
barred.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
what
i
am
really
trying
to
get
at,
mr.
carton,
do
you
want
us
to
hold
that
the
failure
to
file
within
the
180
days
was
a
jurisdictional
defect?
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
you
want
the
settlement
to
stand.
unknown
speaker
either
way,
whether
you
hold
it
jurisdictional
or
not,
you
think
the
district
court
was
entitled
to
approve
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
you
say
about
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
your
chances
are
better
of
having
the
settlement
stand
if
our
holding
is
that
it
is
merely
a
statute
of
limitations
rather
than
a
jurisdictional
defect?
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
embarrassed
by
your
prior
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
respect.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
yes,
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carton,
is
it
possible
to
state
in
one
or
two
sentences
what
is
being
disputed
and
by
whom
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carton,
do
you
want
us
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
what
did
we
do
to
bring
that
on
ourselves?
you
want
us
to
take
this
whole
eleven
years
of
litigation
and
work
out
a
plan.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
want
us
to
take
your
plan.
0
[generallaughter.]
oh,
that
is
different.
well,
certainly
courts
of
equity
are
not
notorious
for
the
speed
with
which
they
move.
take
jarndeis
against
jarndeis.
