mr.
william
a.
jolley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
at
issue
in
80-951
affirms
a
district
court
order
approving
a
settlement
agreement
between
defendant,
twa,
and
plaintiffs
who
were
former
twa
employees.
pursuant
to
that
settlement,
plaintiffs
were
granted
full
union
or
competitive
seniority,
despite
the
fact
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
previously
decided
that
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
establish
a
violation
of
title
7,
despite
the
fact
that
twa
objected...
excuse
me,
despite
the
fact
that
iffa,
the
incumbent
union,
objected
to
that
settlement,
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
settlement
overrides
the
seniority
provisions
of
iffa's
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
twa.
from
at
least
the
effective
date
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
up
until
october
of
1970,
twa
maintained
a
policy
of
terminating
all
flight
attendants
who
became
mothers.
on
may
30th,
1970,
the
first
charge
was
filed
with
the
eeoc
challenging
this
practice.
in
august
of
1970,
this
litigation
was
brought
against
twa
as
a
class
action
purportedly
on
behalf
of
all
flight
attendants
terminated
under
that
policy
since
july
2,
1965.
in
1976,
the
district
court
granted
partial
summary
judgment
against
twa,
holding
that
its
policy
was
indeed
a
violation
of
title
7,
and
also
that
all
claims
were
timely
because
twa
had
engaged
in
a
continuing
violation.
in
1978,
however,
the
seventh
circuit
vacated
that
order
in
a
decision
known
as
the
consolidated
opinion.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
twa's
policy
was
indeed
unlawful,
but
that
there
was
no
continuing
violation,
and
that
the
claims
of
92
percent
of
the
plaintiff
class
were
therefore
untimely
pursuant
to
former
section
706(d),
the
90-day
time
filing
requirement.
plaintiffs
contended
before
the
seventh
circuit
at
that
time
that
twa
had
nevertheless
waived
any
timeliness
defenses.
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
opinion
expressed
doubt
as
to
any
waiver
by
twa,
but
ruled
that
the
time
filing
limit
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
which
in
any
event
is
not
subject
to
waiver
by
twa.
plaintiffs
and
twa
thereupon
filed
petitions
for
certiorari
in
cases
number
78-1545
and
78-1549.
it
is
important
to
note
that
plaintiffs
in
seeking...
in
filing
their
petition
for
certiorari
did
not
seek
review
of
the
seventh
circuit
holding
that
there
was
no
continuing
violation,
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
this
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
order
granting
summary
judgment.
in
june,
1979,
while
those
petitions
for
certiorari
were
pending,
twa
and
the
plaintiffs
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
your
honor,
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
opinion
considered
this
court's
decision
in
evans,
and
relying
in
part
upon
the
decision
in
evans
concluded
that
where
there
is
a
termination
of
employment,
a
permanent
severing
of
the
employment
relationship,
it
is
that
act
that
starts
the
statute
running,
as
opposed
to
a
layoff
situation
where
employees
maintain
a
continued
link
to
their
job
or
to
their
employment,
and
twa's
refusal
in
the
succeeding
years
after
the
terminations
beginning
in
1965
to
rehire
is
not
in
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
a
continuing
violation.
the
violation
was
the
act
of
termination.
the
settlement
agreement
entered
into
by
twa
and
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
divided
the
plaintiffs
into
two
subclasses,
subclass
a
consisting
of
the
8
percent,
approximately
30
in
number,
who
according
to
the
seventh
circuit
had
valid
timely
claims;
subclass
b
consisting
exclusively
of
the
92
percent,
exceeding
400
plaintiffs
in
number,
whose
claims
are
time
barred
according
to
the
seventh
circuit.
under
the
agreement,
twa
agrees
to
pay
each
subclass
$1.5
million
to
be
apportioned
among
the
respective
subclasses.
the
settlement
also
contains
a
non-admission
clause
regarding
twa's
liability
and
a
provision
stating
that
the
settlement
supersedes
past,
present,
and
future
collective
bargaining
agreements.
most
importantly,
the
settlement
provided
that
all
class
members
would
be
offered
re-employment
and
may
obtain
full
competitive
seniority
to
be
awarded
by
the
district
court
"in
its
discretion
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
706(g)
and
all
other
applicable
provisions
of
law
without
contest
or
objection
by
twa.
"
iffa,
the
incumbent
union,
intervened,
and
its
objections
to
the
district
court's
jurisdiction,
to
the
approval
of
the
settlement
agreement,
and
to
an
award
granting
seniority
were
all
overruled
by
the
district
court.
on
appeal,
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
seniority
grant
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
franks
versus
bowman,
and
rejected
iffa's
jurisdictional
challenge
on
the
rationale
that
the
policy
favoring
voluntary
settlements
outweighs
its
lack
of
jurisdiction,
even
though
the
seventh
circuit
left
undisturbed
its
previous
holding
that
the
time
limit
is
jurisdictional.
iffa
stands
before
the
court
today
because
valuable
contract
rights,
indeed,
its
most
cherished
and
important
contract
rights,
previously
bargained
away
to
iffa
by
twa
through
the
collective
bargaining
process,
and
therefore
belonging
to
iffa,
have
been
taken
from
iffa
and
given
to
the
plaintiffs.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
not
only
is
iffa
entitled
to
determine
for
itself
the
collective
bargaining
process,
what
changes
to
make
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
what
provisions
to
try
to
include
or
to
include
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
is
also
entitled
to
compliance
by
twa
with
its
railway
labor
act
obligation
to
deal
exclusively
with
iffa,
and
with
no
other,
not
only
in
setting
but
in
changing
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
which
includes
seniority.
this
court
has
previously
acknowledged
the
overriding
importance
in
today's
economic
system
of
seniority
systems.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
your
honor,
we
certainly
are
not
waiving
the
jurisdictional
question.
we
want
to
address
primarily
the
grant
of
seniority,
because
we
believe
there
is
absolutely
no
foundation
for
a
grant
of
seniority
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
your
honor,
we
would
be
very
happy.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
your
honor,
ordinarily
i
know
that
the
court
first
addresses
jurisdictional
questions
to
determine
the--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--well,
that
is
the
issue
that
is
raised
in
number
1545,
which
is
the
other
case
consolidated.
that
precise
issue
is
before
the
court.
we
do
not
believe--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--your
honor,
we
do
not
believe,
first
of
all,
that
a
district
court
whose
own
court
of
appeals
has
stated
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
has
the
jurisdiction
even
to
approve
a
settlement
agreement.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
as
this
court
has
previously
indicated,
competitive
seniority
rights
determine
the
allocation
between
competing
employees
to
scarce
employment
benefits,
and
indeed
determine
who
gets
and
who
keeps
an
available
job.
in
our
brief,
i
think
we
have
detailed
that
these
remarks
are
even
more
appropriate
to
flight
attendants
by
the
nature
of
their
job.
the
nature
of
the
rights
that
have
been
taken
from
iffa
in
this
case
are
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
since
1979,
when
iffa
intervened
in
the
settlement
of
this
action,
hundreds
of
flight
attendants
have
been
furloughed,
have
not
been
recalled,
and
since
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
superseded
by
the
settlement
agreement
between
plaintiffs
and
twa,
their
contractual
right
to
recall
within
a
period
of
three
years,
which
is
a
part
of
the
current
collective
bargaining
seniority
system,
will
be
deprived
by
the
grant
of
greater
seniority
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
no
question
about
it,
justice
o'connor.
it
did
override.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
your
honor,
the
union
has
chosen,
as
is
its
right
to
do,
in
a
sense
to
agree
by
not
objecting
because
plaintiffs
in
subclass
a
have
come
close
to
carrying
their
burden
required
by
franks
in
order
to
demonstrate
even
the
possibility
of
an
entitlement
to
rightful
place.
iffa
has
made
a
judgment,
as
in
fact
courts
have
done,
that
those
who
file
timely
claims
are
in
a
different
position
than
those
who
have
not,
and
even
though
the
question
of
twa's
violation
as
to
subclass
a
is
pending
before
this
court,
the
jurisdictional
infirmity
does
not
exist
as
to
subclass
a,
and
for
that
reason
we
have
chosen,
as
is
our
right,
to
not
base
our
objections
on
the
competitive
seniority
grant
to
subclass
a
members.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
no,
your
honor.
the
settlement
agreement
itself
states
that
the
seniority
agreement
is
superseded.
moreover,
the
provision
of
the
agreement
which
states
that
flight
attendants
who
are
terminated
or
who
resign
forfeit
all
their
seniority,
that
is
an
integral
part
of
the
seniority
system,
because
it
is
that
provision
which
allows
incumbent
employees
once
they
have
a
job
to
move
up
and
become
more
entitled
to
the
scarce
employment
benefits,
and
that
provision
has
been
superseded,
and
that
is
integral
to
the
functioning
of
the
entire
seniority
system.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
i
don't
believe--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--well,
number
one,
that
question
has
never
been
raised,
and
i
believe
that
before
there
can
be
a
granting
of
seniority
that
belongs
to
iffa,
that
iffa
has
a
right
under
due
process
to
litigate
that
issue,
and
number
two,
there
has...
we
are
not
bound.
that
would
require
us
to
be
a
legal
successor,
which
we
denied,
and
again,
that
has
not
been
litigated,
and
the
actions
of
the
early
union
in
1971,
they
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
which
in
fact
was
based
upon
the
jurisdictional
infirmities
of
92
percent
of
the
plaintiff
class.
and
our
position
is
consistent
with
the
position
of
the
union
at
that
time
in
that
regard.
i
am
running
out
of
time,
and
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
indicating
that
under
our
system
of
laws,
there
are
only
two
ways
in
which
property
which
belongs
to
one
party
can
be
granted
to
another.
it
is
a
simple
proposition.
property
that
belongs
to
me
can
be
given
away
by
my
consent,
or
it
can
be
taken
from
me
after
a
litigation
which
results
in
a
finding
of
a
legal
wrong
which
entitles
someone
to
my
property
after
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
defend
myself
and
to
attempt
to
prove
that
there
has
been
no
such
legal
wrong.
there
has
been
no
voluntary
settlement
in
this
case.
iffa
has
not
agreed
to
the
grant
of
its
seniority.
twa
and
the
plaintiffs
have
entered
into
a
settlement,
and
to
the
extent
that
twa
offered
what
was
twa's
to
give,
and
that
the
plaintiffs
offered
what
was
the
plaintiff's
to
give,
that
is
a
settlement.
that
has
mutuality
of
consideration.
that
is
voluntary.
that
is
not
a
settlement
as
to
iffa.
it
is
not
a
settlement
as
to
the
seniority
rights.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
oh,
absolutely
not.
title
7
contains...
a
remedial
scheme
which
binds...
binds
iffa.
it
has
affirmative
provisions
which
bind
iffa.
but
it
also
has
section
706(g),
which
states
in
clear
terms
that
upon
a
finding
of
the
commission
of
an
unlawful
employment
practice,
upon
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
title
7,
the
court
may
enjoin
that
practice
and
may
award
affirmative
relief.
and
there
has
been
no
such
required
finding.
this
court
in
franks
said
that
such
a
finding
is
required
before
you
get
to
the--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--your
honor,
there
was
a
finding
in
the
1976
order
summary
judgment.
that
judgment
was
reversed
as
to
of
subclass
b
because
of
the...
violation.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
there
is
a
finding,
but
that
is
up
before
the
court
at
this
time
on
certiorari
in
1549.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
it
was
granted
as
not
being
heard.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
i
do
not
believe
that
the
grant
of
certiorari...
the
grant
of
certiorari--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--in
1549
is
deferred.
it
is
still
before
the
court.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
as
to
subclass
a,
we
haven't
objected
at
this
point.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
but
only
as
to
subclass
a,
and
subclass
a
cannot
bootstrap
otherwise
invalid
claims.
the
class
action
procedures
are
only
a
device
for
consolidating
claims
which
are
otherwise
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
in
which
action,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
jolley
the
district...
the
only
order
of
a
violation
was
the
1976
summary
judgment
granted--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--summary
judgment
grant,
which
was
based
on
the
continuing
violation--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--which
was...
to
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
at
least
by
inference
to
subclass
b.
there
is
a
finding
of
a
violation
that
the
policy
was
discriminatory,
and
that
subclass
a
members
were
the
subject
of
a
timely
claim,
and
i
believe
that
ruling
has
been
left
intact,
subject
to
the
writ
of
certiorari
that
has
been
granted
in
this
case
or
held
in
abeyance
by
the
court
in
1549.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
after
the
settlement
was
entered
into,
iffa
intervened,
objected--
mr.
william
a.
jolley
--pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
jolley
after
the
settlement
was
an
accomplished
fact.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
iffa
intervened
for
purposes
of
objecting
to
the
district
court's
jurisdiction,
and
objecting
to
the
settlement,
and
objecting
to
the
grant
of
seniority.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
we
did,
your
honor,
and
the
right
to
be
heard
in
that
proceeding
is
not
the
right
that
is
guaranteed
to
us
under
the
due
process
clause
to
litigate
in
the
first
place
whether
there
has
been
a
finding
of
a
violation
to
litigate
the
merits.
there
has
been
no
determination
on
the
merits
that
twa
has
violated
the
law
under
title
7,
and
therefore
there
is
no
basis
for
exerting
706(g)
remedial
powers,
and
there
has
been
no
settlement.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
argument...
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor,
yes,
there
is
a
conflict.
there
are
conflicts
often
times
in
collective
bargaining
even
between
one
group
of
present
employees
and
another
covered
by
the
same
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
as
this
court
has
held
on
numerous
occasions
going
back
to
steel
versus
louisville,
et
cetera,
the
collective
bargaining
representative
has
the
authority
so
long
as
it
acts
in
good
faith
as
a
part
of
its
collective
bargaining
rule
to
resolve
those
conflicts,
but
yes,
there
is
a
conflict.
however,
this
is
not
a
rightful
place
case.
rightful
place
is
a
term
under
franks
which
arises
only
after
there
is
a
finding
of
a
violation.
this
court
in
both
evans
and
hardison
made
that
point
crystal
clear.
this
is
not
a
rightful
place
case,
certainly
not
as
to
subclass
b.
there
has
been
no
determination
of
a
right
to
that
place.
it
is
a
settlement
agreement
which
the
holder
of
the
right
did
not
enter
into,
and
on
that
basis
it
cannot
stand.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
very
briefly.
mr.
william
a.
jolley
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
four
points
remain
to
be
countered.
plaintiffs
particularly
argue
that
there
has
been
a
finding
of
a
violation
on
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
summary
judgment
order
in
1976.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
district
court
order
approving
the
settlement
agreement,
the
district
court
order
granting
the
seniority,
and
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
affirming
that
exercise
by
the
district
court
did
not
in
any
way
refer
to
the
finding
of
a
violation
on
the
part
of
twa
or
the
commission
of
an
unlawful
employment
practice
by
twa
as
a
basis
for
approving
what
twa
and
the
plaintiffs
did.
it
was
based
instead
entirely
on
and
laced
throughout
referenced
to
the
settlement
agreement
between
twa
and
the
plaintiffs,
and
the
policy
encouraging
voluntary
settlements
even
in
the
lack
of
jurisdiction.
secondly,
the
plaintiff
maintains
that
there
really
was
a
violation
found
as
to
subclass
b
because
the
act...
because
the
practice
by
twa
was
found
to
be
discriminatory.
that
is
not
so,
and
moreover
it
cannot
be
so
by
virtue
of
this
court's
decision
in
evans,
where
you
very
clearly
held
that
the
timely
filing
of
a
charge
is
a
part
of
the
violation,
and
that
a
discriminatory
act
not
made
the
basis
of
a
timely
charge
must
be
treated
as
lawful.
in
that
case,
the
no
marriage
rule
of
the
airline
was
unlawful,
but
it
had
to
be
treated
as
lawful
because
it
was
not
subjected
to
a
timely
filing
of
a
charge.
