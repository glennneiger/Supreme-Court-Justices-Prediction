mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
on
each
of
the
three
issues
in
the
case:
the
in
commerce
issue,
whether
there's
a
violation
of
8(b)(4),
and
the
first
amendment
issue.
the
in
commerce
issue,
it
seems
to
us,
would
be
clarified
if
one
would
pose
the
question
whether
a
primary
labor
dispute
with
these
particular
employers
would
be
covered,
a
dispute
between
the
union
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
the
all-american
cast
of
characters
here.
it
seems
that
the
answer
is
obvious,
and
the
fact
that
the
dispute
here
is
secondary
in
nature
doesn't
give
a
reason
for
reaching
a
different
result.
it's
only
in
cases
where
that
dispute
and
its
manifestations
coincided
with
the
primary
labor
dispute
that
was
outside
the
jurisdiction
that
the
act
that
the
court
has
reached
a
different
result.
here
there
is
no
primary
labor
dispute.
even
though
there
is
a
primary
dispute
of
a
different
nature,
there
is
no
reason
for
concern
that
somehow
the
act
on
the
board's
scope
because
of
a
primary
dispute
that
coincides
with
the
secondary
one
will
be
improperly
extended
beyond
the
area
where
congress
intended
it
to
extend.
and
for
that
reason,
there's
no
reason
to
reach
a
different
result
with
respect
to
a
secondary
dispute
between
the
union
and
these
employers
than
would
be
reached
with
respect
to
a
primary
dispute
which
would
clearly
be
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
mr.
mathews
has
posed
the
hypothetical
that
a
different
result
or
the
result
would
be
clearer
if
this
were
a
russian
ship
rather
than
an
american
ship.
that
question
happens
to
be
pending
before
the
board
now,
and
the
board
has
not
yet
spoken
on
it.
but
what
is
apparent
is
that
the
analog
that
he
draws
to
this
court's
decision
in
windward
and
mobile
does
not
seem
on
the
face
of
it
to
be
the
closest
analog,
because
those
two
cases
involved
a
dispute
about
the
terms
of
employment
of
the
foreign
seamen
on
the
foreign
ship
wherein
so
far
as
a
labor
dispute
is
involved
here,
the
question
is
whether
american
longshoremen
will
service
the
foreign
ship.
that
is
the
type
of
question
that
was
involved
in
the
ariadne
case
rather
than
in
windward
or
mobile
where
the
opposite
result
was
reached.
and
the
court
held
that
picketing
with
respect
to
the
longshoremen
and
the
terms
under
which
they
would
service
a
foreign
ship
was
arguably
protected
by
the
act
and
therefore
could
not
be
enjoined
by
the
state
courts.
and
that
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
seems
to
be
the
closer
analogy
to
the
hypothetical.
with
respect
to
whether
this
is
a
secondary
boycott
prohibited
by
8(b)(4),
in
one
sense
it
is
the
classic
example
of
a
secondary
boycott,
a
refusal
to
handle
hot
cargo,
regardless
of
the
reason
why
the
union
considers
it
to
be
hot
cargo.
it
certainly,
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
within
the
terms
of
8(b)(4),
and
as
we
indicate,
the
legislative
history
discussed
the
purpose
of
8(b)(4)
in
very
comprehensive
terms.
at
one
point
during
the
debate
senator
taft
said
after
hearing
weeks
of
testimony
no
one
ever
succeeded
in
explaining
to
us
the
difference
between
a
good
secondary
boycott
and
a
bad
secondary
boycott.
now,
it
is
true
that
most
of
the
testimony
and
most
of
the
discussion
concerned
what
typically
had
been
experience,
which
was
an
effort
to
engage
in
secondary
boycotts
in
support
of
primary
labor
activity.
political
strikes
were
not
commonplace
and
certainly
weren't
in
the
forefront
of
the
discussion.
minority
views
were
expressed
in
the
committee
reports
and
were
supported
by
president
truman
in
which
they
tried
to
limit
the
prohibition
of
8(b)(4)
so
as
to
preserve
the
legality
of
secondary
activity
that
would
be
in
support
of
legitimate
primary
labor-related
activity
that
the
union
would
have
an
economic
interest
in.
but
even
that
effort
to
preserve
secondary
activity
in
that
limited
context
failed,
even
when
it
would
be
in
the
union's
economic
self-interest
to
engage
in
the
secondary
activity,
because
the
prevailing
view
was
that
the
secondary
activity
unfairly
had
adverse
effects
on
other
employers
and
businesses
that
were
not
offending.
and
there
is
also
one
indication
that
political
strikes
were
not
wholly
beyond
the
attention
span
of
congress
in
enacting
taft-hartley,
and
that
was
the
fact
that
they
included
in
taft-hartley
a
now
repealed
section,
section
9(h),
the
anti-communist
affidavit
section,
that
was
discussed
in
this
court's
opinion
in
american
communications
associations
against
downs,
which
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs
but
it's
339
u.s.
382.
and
the
reason
that
congress
put
the
non-communist
affidavit
into
taft-hartley
was
because
of
concern
that
union
officials
with
an
allegiance
to
a
foreign
power
or
to
a
party
directed
by
a
foreign
power
might
use
their
office
to
conduct
political
strikes,
and
that
would
be
an
unwarranted
disruption
of
commerce.
so
that
this
concern
was
not
wholly
beyond
the
purview
of
those
who
enacted
taft-hartley
and
spoke
in
such
comprehensive
terms
about
prohibiting
secondary
boycotts.
now,
to
turn
briefly
to
the
first
amendment
claim
here,
which
arises
not
in
the
context
of
picketing
where
there
is
arguably
greater
protection
of
free
expression,
but
in
the
context
of
a
union-directed
work
stoppage.
the
hot
cargo,
the
refusal
to
handle
the
hot
cargo
here
really
amounts
to
an
adoption
by
the
union
of
a
trade
embargo
with
a
foreign
power,
what
might
be
thought
to
be
a
quintessentially
governmental
decision
whether
to
engage
in
a
trade
embargo.
the
first
amendment
claim
of
a
right
to
do
this
is
really
quite
an
extraordinary
claim.
this
is
a
matter
that
not
only
is
a
matter
of
high
governmental
policy
but
a
matter
of
concern
to
all
citizens
in
the
country
and
to
all
aspects
of
opinion
in
the
country,
to
be
expressed
through
the
representative
processes.
but
the
union,
because
it
is
strategically
located
to
do
so
on
its
own,
is
claiming
a
right
to
short-circuit
anyone
else's
discussion
of
the
matter
or
efforts
to
influence
governmental
policy
and
to
decide
on
its
own
that
a
trade
embargo
with
a
foreign
nation
will
in
fact
be
effectuated.
this
is
an
extraordinary
claim
of
a
first
amendment
right
which
is
really
antithetical
to
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
basic
submission.
the
fact
that
it
is
conduct
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
a
political
protest
does
not
mean
that
the
first
amendment
immunizes
it.
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--or
wore
black
armbands
or
whatever
they
wanted
to
do.
and
the
board
has
suggested
that
they
could,
of
course,
picket
the
russian
embassy
or
consular
offices.
but
in
united
states
against
o'brien
in
an
opinion
of
this
court
by
chief
justice
warren
a
similar's
claim
was
made
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
right
to
burn
draft
cards
as
a
form
of
political
protest
and
was
rejected
by
the
court.
and
this
is
certainly
conduct
that
has
detrimental
effects
on
other
persons
that
might
even
be
analogized
more
to
a
first
amendment
claim
of
right
to
engage
in
acts
of
political
terrorisms,
but
one
needn't
go
that
far.
there
simply
is
not
a
basis
for
a
legitimate
first
amendment
claim
to
engage
in
conduct
of
this
sort.
