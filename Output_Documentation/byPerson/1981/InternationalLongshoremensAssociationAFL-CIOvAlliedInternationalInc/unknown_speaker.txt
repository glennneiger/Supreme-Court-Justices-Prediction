unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
you
can't
give
up
first
amendment
rights
by
contract?
unknown
speaker
but
the
thrust
of
the
employer's
action
is
to
get
you
back
to
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
somebody
want
to
get
you
back
to
work?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
want
to
get
you
back
to
work.
unknown
speaker
and
so
why
isn't
that
a
labor
dispute?
it's
a
dispute
over
whether
or
not
you
can
cease
furnishing
your
labor
without
suffering
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
that's
what
you
said
there
wasn't
in
the...
that's
what
you
said
it
was
in
the
last
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
nevertheless,
it's
a
dispute
over
whether
you're
going
to
furnish
labor
or
whether
you
can
strike
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
i
know.
but
you
said
it
wasn't
a
labor
dispute.
unknown
speaker
but
the
latter
is
really
a
shorthand
form
of
the
former.
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
a
variation
of
justice
powell's
question
to
you.
suppose
the
particular
employer
was
actively
engaged
in
supporting
the
enactment
of
right-to-work
laws
in
various
states,
including
that
area,
and
otherwise
the
circumstances
were
the
same.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
involved
shipments
to
hawaii
or
alaska?
that's
pretty
much
in
commerce,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
now,
it's
out
of
louisiana
or
make
it
new
jersey
on
its
way
to
ports
in
california
or
seattle.
in
commerce
or
not?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
really
it?
you
keep
saying
in
commerce.
i
expect
that's
only
a
shorthand
way
for
saying
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
differences,
and
this
is
one,
that
congress
did
not
intend
should
be
within
the
reach
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
one.
that's
really
what
your
argument
is.
starting
with
incres,
that
whole
line
of
cases.
unknown
speaker
and
the
definition
has
been
whether
or
not
the
union
is
aimed
at
doing
things
involving
a
foreign
power,
as
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
ships
company
and
that
sort
of
thing,
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
difference,
though,
mr.
mathews?
you
used
the
example
of
the
winward
and
the
mobile
cases,
and
you
point
out
those
were
foreign
ship
owners.
had
they
been
american
ship
owners
that
brought
those
cases,
then
i
think
you'd
agree
they
would
have
been
covered.
unknown
speaker
and
here
we
have
an
american
ship
owner.
unknown
speaker
we
do
have
an
american
ship
owner?
unknown
speaker
we
do
have
an
american
ship
owner.
unknown
speaker
see,
the
words
"in
commerce"
define
a
kind
of
activity
rather
than
the
motive
of
the
people
engaged
in
it,
and
those
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
could
be
summarized
by
saying
that
the
activities
of
foreign
ship
owners
in
delivering
goods
to
the
american
shores
are
not
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
these
statutes.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
exclusion
from
what
would
normally
appear
to
be
commerce
is
foreign
ship
owner
insofar
as
they
employ
foreign
seamen.
unknown
speaker
but
the
dissents
in
those
cases
make
a
pretty
good
argument
for
not
reading
them
expansively,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
strike
banners
said
quit
doing
business
with
some
shipper
that
was
shipping
to
russia?
unknown
speaker
they
went
to
the
employer
and
said
quit
doing
business
with
ford
shipping
to
russia,
and
they
went
on
strike
and
said
quit
doing
business
with
ford.
and
add
to
that
that
the
objective
is
to
have
an
influence
on
the
pending
labor
negotiations
which
are
pending
right
this
minute.
suppose
that
was
the
objective
of
the
union
saying
don't
handle
any
ford
shipments
overseas.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
in
commerce
argument,
though.
no
matter
what
the
purpose
of
the
strike
was,
what
the
ultimate
objective
was,
the
pressure
was
placed
on
the
employer
by
a
strike
to
quit
doing
business
with
ford
because
ford
was
shipping
goods
to
russia.
now,
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
same
commerce
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the
result
of
the
action
that
you
took
in
this
case
was
precisely
that:
quit
doing
business
with
ford?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
the
purpose?
unknown
speaker
are
you
stuck
with
the
results
you
predictably
produce?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
the
state
court
took
this
on
and
then
enjoined
it
you
wouldn't
be
objecting
on
th
ground
that
the
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so
in
terms
of
whether
there
might
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
apply
the
same
rationale
to
whether
it's
in
commerce
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
first
argument
is
that
there's
no
domestic
commerce
involved
here.
unknown
speaker
that
may
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
mean
just
because
it
might
be
in
commerce
doesn't
mean
there's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
--that
your
rationale
about
what
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
may
not
apply
to
whether
it's
in
commerce
or
not.
it
may
be
that
impact
and
effect
are
enough.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
batista,
do
you
understand
that
to
be,
after
you've
gone
all
through
the
policy
considerations,
conclude
therefore
congress
never
intended
this
act
to
reach
that
conduct?
unknown
speaker
hasn't
that
ultimately
been
the...
of
course,
i
was
in
dissent
in
all
those
cases...
but
isn't
that
ultimately
the
bottom
line,
that
a
statute
simply
can't
be
construed
to
reach
conduct
of
this
kind
because
of
the
foreign
policy
considerations.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
batista,
apart
from
the
comity
argument,
hasn't
this
court
in
the
treefruits
case
and
in
the
safeco
case
indicated
that
section
8(b)(4)
is
directed
to
an
isolated
evil,
and
due
to
the
first
amendment
concerns
given
that
a
very
narrow
meaning
quite
apart
from
the
foreign
comity
issue?
unknown
speaker
mr.
batista,
may
i
go
back
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
for
a
moment?
you
emphasize
the
comity
theme
that
runs
through
those
cases,
and
the
point
being,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
american
activity
that's
not
protected
would
interfere
with
foreign
interests
in
running
its
own
affairs
with
respect
to
labor
relations.
but
isn't
there
the
same
comity
interest
here
in
that
the
activity
of
the
international
labor
association
or...
i'm
sorry...
the
longshoremen's
association,
ila,
clearly
must
cause
friction
with
russia
if
they're
not
going
to
ship
goods
to
russia
because
of
this
activity.
why
isn't
the
comity...
i
don't
understand
why
the
comity
argument
you
make
doesn't
cut
against
you.
unknown
speaker
your
point
is
that
it's
friction
caused
by
governmental
activity
as
opposed
to
the
private
activity.
unknown
speaker
your
basic
comity
argument,
though,
would
be
equally
strong
even
if
there
were
russian
flagships.
unknown
speaker
so
is
your
basic
submission
that
it's
conduct
rather
than
speech,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
if
they
just
went
ahead
and
worked
but
carried
the
same
message
around
on
cardboard
it
would
be
all
right.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
refuse
to
handle
and
unload
ships
carrying
japanese
automobiles
on
the
west
coast
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
hurting
the
united
automobile
workers,
which
surely
it
is,
and
a
lot
of
other
people...
bankers,
automobile
dealers.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it's
relevant
to
what
we've
got
before
us
in
these
two
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a
much
greater
compatibility
between
the
latter
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
protecting
american
working
men,
than
there
is
in
the
afghanistan
or
polish
or--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
talking
about
the
pocketbook
issue,
which
is
normally
what
unions
are
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
what
about
refusing
to
handle
any
goods
from
italy
on
the
grounds
that
they're
trying
to
bring
pressure
on
the
pope
on
some
of
this
positions
on
abortion
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
do
anything
unless
you're
outraged.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
do
anything
unless
you're
outraged.
unknown
speaker
well,
who
decides
whether
you're
outraged?
you
do.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
put
yourself
above
the
government?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
it's
the
same
as
though
some
civic
association,
not
a
union,
came
down
and
put
a
picket
line
around
this
ship
between
the
ship
and
the
stevedore,
and
it
just
so
happens
that
the
union
honored
that
picket
line,
and
then
the
employer
tried
to
claim
that
the
association
that
was
doing
the
picketing
was
engaged
in
a
secondary
boycott.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
an
instance
where
a
labor
union,
an
international
union
has
urged
us
to
turn
the
matter
over
to
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think...
this
is
the
first
time.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
first
time.
