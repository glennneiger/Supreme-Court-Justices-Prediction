mr.
duane
r.
batista
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
first
address
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
the
foreign
flagship
cases.
one
essential
thread
that
comes
through
all
of
the
foreign
flagship
cases,
starting
with
benz
through
windward
and
mobile,
is
the
question,
the
concept,
the
issue
of
comity.
again
and
again
this
court
in
those
cases
has
said
it
is
because
of
comity
and
comity
considerations
alone
that
we
find
either
the
given
activity
in
question
to
be
in
commerce
or
not
in
commerce.
i
think
initially
we
need
to
step
back
a
bit
to
take
a
look
at
these
foreign
flagship
cases
and
perhaps
put
them
into
perspective.
to
my
knowledge,
and
neither
the
ila
or
the
afl-cio
in
its
amicus
has
cited
anything
else,
the
foreign
flagship
cases
are
the
only
cases
anywhere
in
our
jurisprudence
that
hold
that
comity
considerations
preclude
a
federal
statute
from
applying
and
regulating
and
governing
the
conduct
of
americans
on
american
soil
that
has
a
substantial
effect
on
other
americans.
mr.
duane
r.
batista
well,
i
think
this
court
in
dealing
with
the
particular
unique
situations
presented
by
the
foreign--
mr.
duane
r.
batista
--yes.
conduct
of
the
kind
presented
in
the
foreign
flagship
cases.
mr.
duane
r.
batista
which
i
hope
to
demonstrate
is
very,
very
different
in
terms
of
comity
considerations
than
the
conduct
involved
in
this
case.
now,
the
foreign
flagship
cases
basically
by
and
large,
and
particularly
windward
and
mobile,
involved
picketing
by
americans
right
at
the
immediate
site
of
a
foreign
flagship
and
its
crew.
it
was
picketing
designed
for
the
purpose
of
either
forcing
american
law
or
american
standards
upon
the
management
and
particularly
labor
relations
of
that
foreign
flagship.
i
think
one
might
reasonably
view,
and
certainly
one
might
reasonably
not
view,
but
one
could
reasonably
view
that
kind
of
conduct
as
creating
a
comity
problem
with
respect
to
relations
with
the
foreign
nation
under
whose
flag
the
ship
was
flying.
here
we
have
a
very,
very
different,
totally
different
situation.
i
think
we
could
perhaps
view
our
situation
if
we
took
a
mirror
image.
let's
assume
that
the
united
states
found
it
necessary
to
intervene
militarily
in
el
salvador.
let
us
assume
that
as
a
result
of
this
a
brazilian
labor
union
interfered
with
trade
between
brazil
and
the
united
states.
let
us
now
assume
that
the
brazilians
applied
their
national
labor
law,
national
brazilian
labor
law,
to
regulate
or
control
the
action
of
that
labor
union.
i
can't
imagine
there's
anybody
in
this
room
that
would
feel
that
somehow
the
brazilians
were
interfering
with
either
internal
united
states
law
or
internal
united
states
policy
by
applying
their
brazilian
national
law
to
cover
and
regulate
the
conduct
of
that
brazilian
labor
union
in
brazil.
and
that
of
course,
flipping
the
mirror
image
back
again,
is
exactly
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
duane
r.
batista
well,
that
really
goes
to
the
second
issue
which
is
not
jurisdiction
but
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
act.
and
i
think
if
we
turn
to
that
issue,
we
really,
allied
and
i
think
the
nlrb,
reading
their
opinion,
are
strongly
relying
on
safeco
and
precisely
the
distinction
made
by
this
court
between
safeco
and
treefruits,
which
is
fundamentally
that
when
a
union
induces
employees
to,
in
this
case,
refuse
to
handle
a
product,
and
it
is
reasonably
foreseeable
that
substantial
business
disruption
will
result
from
that
inducement,
and
that
inducement
can
no
way
be
viewed
as
a
primary
strike,
then
by
applying
the
simple,
plain
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
of
section
8(b)(4),
you
have
a
secondary
boycott.
as
far
as
the
impact
of
the
constitutional
element
is
concerned,
safeco
specifically
drew
the
distinction
between
on
one
hand
the
substantial
business
disruption,
on
the
other
hand
contrasting
treefruits,
the
slight
business
disruption.
also,
i
think
an
excellent
point
was
made
by
occidental
in
their
amicus
brief
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issue,
and
that
was
there
would
be
no
constitutional
issue
raised
in
this
case
if
this
were
just
a
run-of-the
mill,
ordinary
hot
cargo
secondary
boycott
arising
out
of
a
run-of-the-mill,
ordinary
labor
dispute
over
wages,
hours,
terms,
or
conditions
of
employment
that
caused
this
degree
of
disruption.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
degree
of
disruption
had
been
caused
arising
out
of
a
political
objective...
for
example,
protestors
blocking
exits
or
entrances
to
a
nuclear
power
plant...
again,
there
would
be
no
question
that
those
protestors
who
are
disrupting
the
operation
of
that
nuclear
power
plant
didn't
have
first
amendment
protection
to
do
this.
so
in
other
words,
what
we're
suggesting
is
what
the
ila
is
trying
to
do
here
is
add
nothing
to
nothing
and
get
something.
we
really
submit
and
we
think
that
the
briefs,
not
only
our
brief,
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
the
briefs
of
the
amici
dealing
with
the
constitutional
issue
show
very
conclusively
that
there
really
is
absolutely
no
substantial
constitutional
issue
here.
the
scale
of
disruption
on
one
hand
when
balanced
again
against
whatever
residual
constitutional
interests
might
be
involved,
remember,
we
are
not
talking
here
about
rights
of
individual
workers
to
refuse
individually
or
even
spontaneously
in
concert
to
handle
product.
we
are
talking
about
an
order
issued
by
the
head
of
a
major
labor
union
who
has
the
power...
which
labor
union
has
the
power
to
shut
down
trade,
east
coast,
gulf
coast,
and
the
great
lakes
ports.
and
as
far
as
we
can
see,
the
only
constitutional
right
involved
is
that
of
allegedly
a
mr.
gleason
to
apply
his
own
beliefs
and
his
own
feelings;
and
we
feel
that
that
certainly
is
not
balanced
out
vis-a-vis
the
extraordinary
disruption
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
duane
r.
batista
well,
for
one
thing,
the
activity,
governmental
regulation
of
that
activity
can
only
create
a
comity
problem
if
that
government
regulation
tends
to
protect
the
activity.
in
this
situation,
as
we've
tried
to
develop
in
our
brief
and
also
some
of
the
amici,
the
activity
in
question
can't
be
protected
because
unlike
the
primary
picketing
at
the
primary
situs
of
a
foreign
flagship,
which
could
be
arguably
protected
activity
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
picketing,
statements
perhaps
some
of
the
pickets
have
made,
and
what
not...
here,
the
conduct
occurring
in
the
united
states,
the
order
of
mr.
gleason,
which
is
the
conduct
in
question,
is
clearly
secondary.
and
secondly,
as
also
demonstrator
argued
by
mr.
gies
in
the
jbt
case,
it
can't
be
protected
in
any
event
by
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
it's
devoted
towards
a
political
objective
by
virtue
of
this
court's...
at
least
language
in
this
court's
eastex
decision.
so
for
that
reason
we
cannot
see--
mr.
duane
r.
batista
--well,
the
friction
can
be
caused
by
the
private
activity.
the
question
of
comity
comes
into
play
where
the
governmental
activity
tends
to
protect
something
that
causes
the
friction.
here
we're
going
in
the
other
direction.
i
think
here
we're
going
in
the
direction
really
of
the
question
that
was
raised
in
the
plumbers
union
v.
dorr
county
case
before
this
court
in
the
late
1950s
where
the
issue
was
whether
secondary
boycott
applications
law
could
apply
to
a
dispute
with
the
county
or
municipality.
and
the
question
was
raised
does
this
interfere
with
the
municipality,
and
this
court's
answer
was
no,
if
anything,
applying
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
to
terminate
the
disruption
furthered
the
interest
of
the
municipality.
so
for
these
reasons
we
really
feel
that
the
foreign
flagship
cases
are
totally
distinguishable
and
apart
from
this
situation.
one
final
element
which
is
also
quite
distinguishable
and
should
be
kept
in
mind,
the
essential
inherent
dispute
or
difference
in
this
case
revolves
around
the
cargo.
now,
while
mr.
gleason's
order
also
involves
russian
ships,
russian
ships
are
not
involved
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
in
this
particular
case.
we
used
the
example,
hypothetical
in
our
brief.
this
case
conceptually
could
have
arisen
just
as
easily
in
the
middle
of
nebraska
where
on
a
trucking
dock
in
omaha
a
teamster
local
union
order
its
members
not
to
handle
russian
cargo.
and
it
just
simply
escapes
allied
what
possible
relevance
foreign
flagship
cases
could
have
to
this
essential
product
and
cargo
dispute.
so
it's
only
the
cargo
dispute
and
the
product
dispute
that
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
duane
r.
batista
yes,
in
our
view.
i
think
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions...
well,
let
me
just
cover
one
point
further
relating
to
the
secondary
boycott
issue,
and
that
is
that
one
particular
statement
that
my
brother
mr.
mathews
made
i
feel
is
particularly
cogent
relating
to
the
situation
faced
by
allied
in
terms
of
the
russian
boycott,
and
that
was
that
a
safety
factor,
he
said,
in
restricting
political
strikes
and
disruption
of
this
nature
is
the
union
members'
need
to
and
interest
in
being
able
to
eat.
the
critical
element
as
far
as
allied
is
concerned
is
we
don't
have
that
safety
factor
here.
russian
trade
is
but
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
the
trade
that
passes
through
every
or
most
of
the
ports
in
this
country.
as
long
as
those
ports
are
reasonably
busy,
the
union
can
order
its
members
not
to
handle
russian
cargo,
and
those
members
will
lose
little
or
nothing
in
terms
of
wages.
also,
the
shipping
association
employers,
as
a
result
of
this,
as
long
as
the
ports
are
reasonably
busy,
losing
little
or
nothing
in
profits.
so
they
have
no
interest
in
terminating
the
dispute,
the
union
members
have
little
or
no
interest.
it
is
only
allied
and
the
interests
of
american
foreign
policy
and
others
involved
in
russian
trade
that
are
adversely
affected.
that's
precisely
why
we
feel
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
protection
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
ensure
that
parties
such
as
allied
can
have
protection,
and
the
public
can
have
protection,
and
the
national
interest
can
have
protection
against
this
kind
of
union
conduct.
allied
asked
the
boston
shipping
association
to
file
and
commence
a
301
action
under
their
labor
contract.
they
refused.
it
just
wasn't
important
enough
to
them.
and
indeed,
only
five
301
actions,
according
to
the
union's
brief,
were
filed
against
this
russian
boycott
that
involved,
oh,
perhaps
over
a
billion
dollars'
worth
of
trade
potentially.
one
of
those,
of
course,
was
occidental's
in
the
jbt
case.
so
we
cannot
rely
on
contracting
parties
to
resolve
this
kind
of
issue.
we
need
the
national
labor
relations
act.
thank
you.
