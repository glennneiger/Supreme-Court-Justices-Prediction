justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
third
case
that
i
have,
80-1663,
international
longshoremen's
association
versus
allied
international
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
respondent,
allied
international
is
an
american
importer
of
russian
wood
products.
on
january
9,
1980,
the
petitioner,
the
international
longshoremen's
association,
declared
a
boycott
by
its
members
of
cargos
arriving
from
the
soviet
union.
the
union
took
this
action
to
protest
the
invasion
of
afghanistan.
as
a
result
of
the
boycott,
union
members
refused
to
unload
shipments
to
allied
with
whom
the
union
had
no
dispute.
allied's
shipments
were
disrupted
completely
and
it
sued
for
damages
as
a
victim
of
a
secondary
boycott.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
held
that
allied
had
stated
a
claim
for
relief
under
section
303
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
section
8(b)(4)(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
affirm,
as
commendable
as
the
union's
ultimate
objectives
may
be,
the
certain
effect
of
its
action
was
to
impose
serious
losses
on
neutral
employers.
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
burden
that
the
secondary
boycott
previsions
of
the
labor
laws
were
designed
to
prevent.
the
opinion
of
the
court
again
is
unanimous.
