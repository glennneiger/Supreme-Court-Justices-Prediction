mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
totally
different
aspect
of
the
same
union
conduct
that
gave
rise
to
the
jacksonville
bulk
case.
in
that
case
you
had
an
employer
suing
under
section
301
of
the
labor
act
to
enforce
his
no
strike
clause.
in
this
case
you
have
a
customer
of
a
customer
of
the
longshoremen's
employer
who
brought
an
action
for
damages
under
section
303
of
the
act,
alleging
that
the
union's
conduct
was
a
secondary
boycott
in
violation
of
section
8(b)(4).
that
section
provides
or
forbids
a
union
from
picketing
or
refusing
to
handle
goods
where
an
object
thereof
is
to
force
someone
to
cease
doing
business
with
someone
else.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
which
by
a
divided
panel
reversed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
section
303
suit.
there
were
other
causes
of
action
pleaded
which
we
will
allude
to,
but
they
are
not
the
subject
of
the
proceeding
this
afternoon.
the
union
takes
the
position
in
this
suit
that
just
as
occidental
said
so
strenuously,
there
is
no
labor
dispute.
we
are
now
echoing
it.
there
is
no
labor
dispute,
because
the
ingredient
of
suit
on
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
under
a
provision
to
provide
labor
is
not
at
issue
in
this
lawsuit.
the
only
dispute
here,
we
say,
is
that
non-labor
political,
and
most
important,
foreign
dispute
between
the
union
and
the
russians.
we
feel
that
the
first
circuit
was
in
error
when
it
held
that
the
activities
in
this
case
were
in
commerce
so
as
to
be
even
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
303
of
the
act.
we
also
feel
that
they
were
in
error
when
they
held
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act
when
in
this
case
there
just
isn't
any
primary
labor
dispute.
and
we
also
would
urge
this
court
that
the
activity
of
the
longshoremen
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
that's
a
long
way
down
the
road.
actually,
the
jurisdictional
point
on
whether
the
case
is
in
commerce
disposes
of
everything,
and
you
go
beyond
there
to
whether
you
have
a
primary
labor
dispute.
that
the
court
should
get
to
the
first
amendment
question
is
probably
doubtful,
but
i
think
it
casts,
if
you
will,
a
shadow
forward
because
so
much
of
what
i
will
say
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
this
is
a
political,
but
more
important
that
it
is
a
conscientious
refusal
to
be
involved
in
evil.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
you
certainly
can,
and
this
is
not
a
contract
case.
that's
why
we
really
didn't
urge
the
first
amendment
case
too
strenuously
in
the
jacksonville
bulk
thing,
because
the
arbitrator
could
very
well
say
yes,
but
you've
waived
them
by
contract,
and
you
can.
but
in
this
case
it's
not
a
contract
case,
and
the
ila
has
not
waived
their
rights.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
the
thrust
of
whose
action?
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
actually
no.
in
this
case
they're
seeking
damages.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
yes.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no.
well,
there
is
a
labor
dispute
element
vis-a-vis
our
own
employer.
there
is
no
labor
dispute
element--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes.
we
said
it
was
a
labor
dispute.
it
is
a
labor
dispute
when
it's
on
a
labor
contract.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes,
but...
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
problem
with
norris-laguardia
in
this
particular--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
primary
dispute.
there
may
be
a
secondary
labor
dispute;
that
is,
whether
we
have
to
work
or
not.
but
there
is
no
primary
labor
dispute,
and
in
the
course
of
my
argument
i
will
get
to
that
issue.
but
much
more
fundamental
is
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
the
activities
here
are
in
commerce.
and
here
the
union
relies
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
a
few
years
ago,
or
a
whole
line
of
decision
really
going
back
for
some
20,
almost
25
years,
but
particularly
the
last
two
statements
in
the
windward
and
mobile
cases.
over
a
period
of
years
the
court
has
ruled
that
the
nlra
was
just
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
thrust
into
affairs
that
did
not
concern
domestic
commerce.
the
phrase
that
the
court
has
used
to
denote
what
was
not
under
the
act
is
"not
in
commerce".
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
it's
a
term
of
art.
and
sometimes
you
might
say
it's
not
subject
to
nlrb
jurisdiction,
sometimes
you
might
say
it's
not
subject
to
the
act,
sometimes
you
might
say
it's
not
in
commerce.
al
the
time
you
are
talking
about
the
same
thing:
what
did
congress
intend
to
cover
by
the
act.
and
the
phrases
they
weave
in
and
out,
but
i
think
they
always
mean
the
same
thing.
and
the
court
has
said...
of
course,
the
ramification
if
they
are
not
in
commerce
and
not
subject
to
the
act,
then
they
are
not
subject
to
regulation
by
the
nlrb,
and
they
also
cannot
be
made
the
subject
of
an
action
under
section
303
of
the
act.
most
of
these
cases
have
involved
causes
of
action
brought
by
foreign
entities
themselves
against
the
union
who
has
picked
a
dispute
or
gotten
involved
in
a
dispute
with
the
foreign
entity.
and
in
most
of
the
cases
the
foreign
7
entity
has
gone
into
state
court,
and
the
union
has
tired
to
say
no,
this
is
under
the
federal
act;
and
this
court
has
consistently
told
the
union
no,
it
is
not
under
the
federal
act;
the
foreign
entity
may
pursue
its
remedies
in
state
court.
in
windward
this
court
held
that
the
union
activity
to
protest
wages
and
conditions
on
a
foreign
ship
was
not
in
commerce
when
it
was
complained
of
by
the
foreign
ship
owner.
it
was
the
classical
thing.
the
foreign
ship
owner
went
to
state
court.
the
union
said
no,
there's
no
jurisdiction.
i
believe
in
that
case
the
state
court
agree
with
the
union.
it
went
up
through
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
came
to
this
court,
and
the
court
said
no,
this
is
not
even
arguably
protected
by
the
federal
act,
it
is
matter
of
state
law,
and
sent
the
case
back.
that
arose
in
the
port
of
houston.
then
a
few
months
later
in
the
port
of
mobile,
alabama
the
union
did
the
same
thing
to
the
same
ship
company,
but
instead
of
the
ship
company
bringing
the
action,
an
american
employer
who
hired
longshoremen...
in
this
case
the
longshoremen
were
not
the
picketing
people...
but
the
american
stevedore
brought
a
state
tort
action
saying
you're
interfering
with
my
contract
to
unload
the
ship,
and
i
believe
a
soybean
farmer
brought
an
action
saying
you're
interfering
with
my
contract
to
have
my
soybeans
carried.
and
the
union
said
look,
what
they're
arguing
here
is
a
secondary
boycott
subject
to
section
8(b)(4)
of
the
act.
it
is
under
federal
jurisdiction
and
you
can't
bring
a
state
court
action.
and
this
court
again
instructed
the
union
no,
that
is
not
true.
we
held
in
the
windward
case
that
your
activity
directed
towards
a
foreign
entity
was
not
in
commerce,
and
we
can't
say
that
the
same
activity,
just
because
it's
complained
of
by
a
different
plaintiff,
is
now
capable
of
being
split
off
or,
and
the
word
the
court
uses
the
key
word,
is
bifurcated,
and
made
the
subject
of
a
domestic
dispute.
no,
leave
it
to
the
state
courts.
i
think
this
case
would
not
have
presented
any
difficulty
to
anyone
if
we
had
had
our
companion
windward
case.
if
the
first
time
that
this
russian
action
of
the
longshoremen
had
been
triggered
was
when
a
russian
ship
came
into
port...
and
they
were
on
their
way
when
the
thing
was
called...
when
this
russian
ship
came
into
port
if
the
longshoremen
had
refused
to
handle
the
goods,
whatever
they
might
have
been,
and
the
russians
had
gone
into
state
court,
i
think
anyone
would
see
that
the
principles
in
windward
apply
even
more
persuasively
than
they
did
in
winward.
not
only
is
this
not
a
dispute
aimed
at
the
concerns
of
the
domestic
labor
act...
the
wages,
conditions,
hours
of
employment,
the
relations
between
domestic
employers
and
employees...
but
it's
not
even
concerned
with
labor
at
all.
it's
concerned
with
military
policy,
if
you
will,
foreign
policy.
the
thrust
of
the
union's
action
is
in
no
way
directed
toward
a
labor
objective
and
is
outward
directed
away
from
our
shores
a
half
a
world
away
to
afghanistan.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
have
any
difficulty
seeing
that
that
was
not
a
labor
dispute
in
commerce.
i
confused
my
terms.
labor
dispute
was
the
last
case.
the
key
word
here
is
that
was
not
in
commerce
for
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
preemption,
so
that
these
russians
could
not
go
into
state
court.
if
we'd
had
that
case,
as
i
say,
the
windward
principles
would
apply,
and
then
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
once
you
had
your
windward,
your
mobile
would
follow.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
and
there
was
no
foreigner.
then
i
don't
think
the
in
commerce
problem
would
arise,
no.
what
makes
it
not
in
commerce
is
the
fact
that
it
is
directed
outside.
the
question
as
to
whether
it's
a
labor
dispute
and
all
that
might
still
arise,
but
we
couldn't
make
the
argument
that
that
was
not
in
commerce,
no.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
hawaii
and
alaska
are
part
of
the
united
states.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
the
goods
may
be
in
commerce.
the
dispute
is
not
in
commerce.
that
is
the
point.
when
you
read
windward
and
mobile,
the
thing
that
is
not
in
commerce
is
not
the
goods.
i
mean,
this
court
was
not
blind
to
reality.
the
activities
in
all
of
these
cases...
benz,
mcculloch,
incres,
all
of
them,
ariadne...
they
were
all
just
as
much
in
commerce
as
a
practical
effect.
but
what
isn't
in
commerce,
if
mr.
brezhnev
gets
a
stomachache,
the
stock
market
goes
down;
in
our
interrelated
world,
everything's
in
commerce.
but
when
we're
talking
about
those
words
"in
commerce",
it's
what
did
congress
intend
to
regulate.
congress
didn't
intend
to
regulate
foreign--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that's
right.
and
here
the
same
thing.
well--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes
i
would
think
so.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes
and
no.
the
american
ship
owner
is
not
bringing
this
case.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes,
but
this
is
not...
i
mean
obviously
we
are
not...
our
boycott,
our
activity
is
not
limited
to
a
particular
ship
the
way
that
was.
it's
limited
to
russian
goods
and
maybe
russian
goods
carried
on
american
ships.
the
first
circuit,
whose
decision
we're
appealing
here,
grappled
with
that
problem,
too,
because
the
board
after
it
failed
to
get
a
10(1)
injunction
against
this
in
houston,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit
on
this
very
ground
that
it
wasn't
in
commerce,
went
to
boston
and
tried
to
get
an
injunction
and
made
the
argument
well,
then,
in
houston
the
ship
was
a
foreign
ship
and
in
boston
the
ship
is
an
american
ship.
and
it
didn't
get
very
far
with
the
first
circuit,
because
as
the
court
realized,
it's
th
nature
and
thrust
of
the
union's
activity.
what
is
the
union
trying
to
affect?
now,
if
it
were
an
american
ship
and
we
were
trying
to
affect
the
conditions
aboard
an
american
ship,
pay
to
american
seamen
who
were
subject
to
the
act,
yes,
that
would
be
in
commerce.
where
it's
not
an
american
ship--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
yes...
no,
i
don't
think
they
could,
because
the
one
little
exception
that
proves
the
rule,
that
the
court
in
the
ariadne
case
where
if
you
looked
at
what
happened,
there
were
the
people
on
the
dock
and
there
was
the
foreign
ship,
but
you
really
couldn't
tell
what
it
was
all
about,
the
court
held
that
was
in
commerce
because
what
they
were
disputing
over
was
the
foreign
ships
wages
that
they
payed
american
longshoremen
on
the
ground.
so
it's
really
what
is
the
union
trying
to
affect.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
that
of
course
is
an
argument
that
some
people
make,
that
the
only
thing
that's
not
in
domestic
commerce
are
foreign
ship
owners
who
don't
employ
or
employ
foreigners.
i
think
that's
restricting
mobile
and
windward
to
the
precise
situation
raised
there,
and
it's
really
unrealistic.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
but
for
instance,
what
would
you
do
if
the
same
thing
happened
at
an
airport,
and
we
no
longer
had
a
foreign
ship
owner
but
we
had
a
foreign
air
fleet,
and
the
objection
was
to
the
way
they
paid
their
pilots
or
something.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
a
real
distinction
there.
the
real
thing
is,
the
controlling
factor
was
what
this
court
said,
that
the
congress
just
didn't
intend
to
regulate
these
foreign
matters,
strain
them
through
the
filament
of
this
act.
and
the
court
based
its
holding
very
strongly
on
an
idea
of
comity,
which
i
really
think
i
have
to
address
because
everyone
seems
to
take
this
comity
to
mean
they
didn't
want
the
national
labor
relations
board
getting
involved
in
all
this.
and
i
think
that
that's
a
very
oversimplified
approach,
because
there
was
no
question
in
most
of
those
cases
but
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
just
wasn't
going
to
get
into
it.
nobody
could
force
somebody
to
bring
a
charge
before
the
nlrb
any
more
than
they
could
force
them
to
bring
a
section
303
action.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
would
i
make
the
same
argument?
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
to
have
an
influence
on
ford's
pending
labor...
well,
no.
if
that
were
in
fact
the
case,
then
i
don't
think
you
could
say
it
was
not
in--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think...
because
you
would
not
have
that
first
confrontation
between
the
union
and
the
foreign
power.
i
think
really
there
you
have
a
bifurcated--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
do
it
by
the
result.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
well,
that's
part
of
the
essential
analysis
of
any
secondary
boycott
is
purpose,
and
it
seems
to
run
through,
as
i
say
in
the
ariadne
case,
it
was
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
union.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no,
i
would
not.
if
you
want
to
jump
to
that,
justice
white,
i
think
that
kind
of
mechanistic
approach
is
just
one
reason
why
this
thing
should
be
left
to
state
courts
and
not
given
to
a
bureaucratic
agency
that
tries
to
put
round
holes
in
square
pegs.
the
only
thing...
and
all
of
the
evidence...
mean
you
do
not
have
before
you
the
analogs--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
we
certainly
wouldn't
now,
not
with
what
we
know
about,
the
nlrb,
certainly
not.
[laughter]
no.
and
we
really
feel
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
involved
is
really
just
beyond,
i
don't
want
to
say
competence,
but
the
ken
of
the
board.
they
look
at
things
from
this
secondary
boycott
point
of
view.
if
i
can
give
you
an
example,
we
raised
first
amendment
questions.
they
get
so
far
as
the
finding
that
the
international
union
did
certainly
encourage
the
longshoremen
in
what
they
did.
once
you
have
that,
that's
enough
to
make
an
inducement
for
a
secondary
boycott.
but
they
stop
right
there
and
then
just
don't
go
into
the
question
of
where
did
this
come
from,
was
it
really
an
expression
of
the
will
of
the
individual
workers.
we've
satisfied
our
inducement.
you
check
that
box
and
mechanistically
you
go
on
to
the
next.
any
predictable,
foreseeable
result
must
be
an
object.
in
fact,
they
amend
section
8(b)(4)
and
put
"effect"
instead
of
"object".
if
the
union
could
predict
it,
it
must
be
an
object
of
the
union
to
bring
to
pass.
i,
for
one,
can't
see
how
a
rational
person
does
that.
i've
said
to
every
court
if
i
wished
to
marry
a
girl,
i
get
her
mother
as
my
mother-in-law.
it
is
necessary,
it
is
foreseeable,
it
is
predictable,
but
it
may
be
the
furthest
thing
from
my
object
in
the
world.
but
in
our
human
life
we've
got
to
take
the
good
with
the
bad.
if
the
union's
object
was
nothing
more
than
to
themselves
refrain
from
being
involved
in
dealing
with
the
invaders,
the
predictable
results
would
be
just
the
same.
you
just
can't
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
have
had
some
other
object.
they
may
have
only
the
object
to
control
their
own--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--i
was
talking
in
terms
of
the
unfair
labor
practice.
your
question
escapes
me,
sir.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that's
right.
that
the
whole
thrust,
purpose,
motive
of
ila's
activity--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no,
that's
true.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
to
bring
it
into
commerce.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
it
may
be.
of
course,
we
would
argue
if
it
is
in
commerce,
why,
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
we
don't
have
the
prescribed
object.
if
you
will,
i'd
like
now
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
a
word
about
the
safety
factor,
the
asymmetrical
problem
that
mr.
batista
mentions.
all
i
can
say
is
that
really
it's
sort
of
a
naive
argument
to
make.
the
last
time
this
union
was
before
this
court
it
was
on
the
question
of
containerization,
the
infamous
rules
on
containers,
where
the
union
is
going
crazy
over
the
loss
of
work
due
to
technology.
to
think
that
the
loss
of
any
day's
pay
is
not
a
real
sacrifice
for
longshoremen
to
make
or
for
locals
who
have
particularly
heavy
traffic
in
russian
cargo
is
just
simply
not
to
be
with
the
realities.
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
of
the
condition
of
the
united
states
merchant
marine
at
this
time.
most
cargo
is
carried
on
foreign
ships.
to
think
that
the
ship
owners
and
the
shipping
associations
are
not
concerned
over
loss
of
business
is
just
to
be
arguing
in
a
different
world.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
in
that
case
i
don't
think
you
would
have
the
not
in
commerce
argument,
because
what...
the
union's
dispute
would
not
be
motivated
towards
the
policies
of
the
foreign
competitor.
it
would
be
motivated
toward
the
policies
of
people
who
import
japanese
goods.
it's
not
that
the
japanese
did
something
bad,
they
made
the
best
product
they
could
at
the
cheapest
price.
i
really...
of
course,
it
is
your
job
to
probe
and
think
of
this
possible
ramification
and
that
possible
ramification,
but
i'd
much
rather
argue
the
case
that
i
have.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
it's
relevant,
but
it's
not
quite
the
same
thing
that
you
have
before
you;
because
as
i
said
at
the
start,
this
is
a
transcendent
thing.
the
invasion
of
afghanistan
and
the
polish
thing
is
such
a
horrible
situation
that
the
union's
response
to
say
i
just
don't
want
to
have
any
part
to
do
with
those
people
is
a
perfect--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--i
would
disagree.
i
don't
feel
any
particular
outrage
that
the
japanese
make
a
better
good
than
us
cheaper
and
sell
it
here.
i
do
feel
outraged
at
what
happened
in
poland
and
what
happened
in
afghanistan,
and
the
longshoremen
did,
too.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
but
that's
why
i
say
this
isn't
a
pocketbook
issue.
it's
not
a
labor
dispute.
it's
not
a
commercial
dispute.
it's
a
political
dispute.
it's
a
conscientious
dispute.
and,
you
know,
to
try
to
squeeze
it
into
the
mold
of
the
labor
act
is
to
regulate--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--of
course,
your
honor,
you
can
make
a
million
examples.
the
point
is
the
world
was
outraged
at
afghanistan,
as
we
have
been
by
poland.
the
pope
himself
said
don't
stand
by,
world,
and
let
solidarity
go
down
the
drain.
the
polish
ambassador
said
do
something,
america;
you
know,
don't
just
bring
lech
walesh
over
here
and
give
him
awards,
do
something.
the
longshoremen
did
something.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
i
think
it
has
to
be--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--sure.
that's
a
personal...
what
outrageous
means.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
not
above
the
government.
what
we're
saying
is
you
don't
use
a
labor
act
to
squelch
activity
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
labor.
that's
the
problem
here.
you're
trying
to
take
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
as
justice
o'connor
said
had
certain
specific
evils
to
regulate,
and
those
evils
weren't
political
protests,
political
protests
that
other
people
might
find
unpleasant.
look,
if
any
business
decided
they
don't
want
to
handle
russian
goods,
their
workers
lose
the
work,
but
nobody
would
say
they're
violating
the
law.
why
shouldn't
longshoremen
have
the
same
right
to
do
what
sam
goldwyn
said,
include
me
out.
as
long
as
you're
going
to
act
like
that,
we're
putting
you
in
coventry.
we
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you.
and
to
question
that
this
is
not
really
a
conscientious
decision,
a
decision
that
really
goes
to
the
deepest
held
feelings
about
what
is
right
and
wrong
i
think
is
just
to
put
blinders
on.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i
do.
and
i
think
that,
you
know,
we
shouldn't
have
the
protection
of
the
act
in
that
situation.
in
that
situation
you
have
no
norris-laguardia.
send
it
to
state
court.
you
know,
in
doing
the
research
of
this
case
i
was
amazed
at
the
number
of
times
that
the
federal
district
courts
just
take
a
case
which
somebody
tries
to
bring
as
a
secondary
boycott
and
says
this
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
you're
fighting
with
a
landlord
over
the
rent,
or
you're
fighting
about
the
collection
of
a
bill.
remand
it
to
the
state
courts.
they
never
get
up
to
the
circuits
because
it's
not
an
appealable
order,
but
they
do
it
as
a
matter
of
course.
what
allied
has
here
is
a
claim
for
tortuous
interference
with
conscience,
and
we're
willing
to
litigate
that
claim
in
the
state
courts,
but
don't
federalize
it.
don't
make
it
a
federal
case
which
puts
the
imprimatur
of
the
united
states
government
on
any
result.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no,
i
don't.
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
but
i
would
be
willing
to
litigate
this
case--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--in
front
of
an
american
jury
rather
than
a
bunch
of
bureaucrats
who
very
frankly
let
it
come
through
that
their
opinion...
and
this
would
be
my
closing
word...
that
what's
important
here
is
policy.
forget
the
law.
forget
that
it's
congress
who
writes
the
statutes.
make
your
own
new
amendments
to
the
norris-laguardia.
forget
your
precedents.
but
just
stop
this
boycott.
i
think
that's
an
argument
that
is
so
ironic
in
this
case
because
it
really
belongs
over
there
on
the
same
people
who
went
into
afghanistan.
