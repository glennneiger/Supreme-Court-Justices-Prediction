mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
the
globe
newspaper
company,
publisher
of
a
newspaper
called
the
boston
globe,
which
is
circulated
in
the
city
of
boston
and
elsewhere
throughout
new
england.
we
are
here
today
to
seek
reversal
of
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
holding
that
a
massachusetts
statute,
general
laws,
chapter
268,
section
16(a),
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
constitutes
a
permissible
method
for
regulating
the
trial
of
certain
criminal
cases.
in
essence,
the
statute
provides
that
at
the
trial
of
cases
involving
crimes
of
sex,
the
court
is
required
to
exclude
the
press
and
the
public
from
the
courtroom
while
the
minor
victim--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--precisely,
mr.
justice.
that
is
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
that
is
exactly
how
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
construed
it
to
read.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
if--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--we
would
be
here
on
this
record.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
at
the
time
the
closure
order
was
entered,
there
surely
was
no
question
raised
by
the
complaining
witness.
at
the
time--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--it
is
unclear
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
i
don't
think
her
privacy
could
be
guaranteed
by
what
was
done
here
if
by
privacy
we
mean
disclosure
of
potentially
embarrassing
facts,
because
this
statute
doesn't
reach
the
problem
that
is
covered
by
that
kind
of
a
situation.
beyond
that,
i
am
not
sure
from
what
i
described
as
an
uninformative,
and
i
think
it
is
an
uninformative
colloquy
that
took
place
in
chambers
after
these
orders
were
entered,
precisely
what
her
concerns
about
privacy
were.
after
all,
that
colloquy
dealt
with
the
prosecutor's
representation
to
the
court
concerning
what
the
victim
them
had
said
to
her,
the
prosecutor.
before
that,
at
the
time
the
hearing
took
place
before
a
single
justice,
the
representation
was
that
the
prosecutor
had
consulted
fully
with
the
victims,
and
that
literally
on
their
behalf
the
commonwealth
was
waiving
whatever
rights
it
had
under
the
statute.
at
most,
i
would
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
colloquy
and
its
dimensions
illustrate
the
critical
need
for
a
hearing
in
cases
like
this,
so
that
questions
like
the
one
you
have
just
asked
can
be
answered
on
some
kind
of
a
factual
record
which
lets
people
know
precisely
what
is
going
on
and
what
the
precise
concerns
of
the
victim
are.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
i
agree,
and
that--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice,
but...
and
i
am
not
quarreling
with
that...
with
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
says.
that
is
a
reason
in
our
judgment,
and
we
suggest
strongly
to
you
that
this
statute
is
invalid,
and
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
questions,
i
was
suggesting
that
this
kind
of
colloquy
and
the
kinds
of
problems
that
are
demonstrated
by
that
kind
of
colloquy
illustrate
the
need
for
a
hearing
before
some
kind
of
an
order
of
closure
can
be
entered.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
i
would
if
that
is
all
we
had,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--on
this
record,
i
would
challenge
that.
yes,
i
would,
and
i
think
that
the
reason
for
challenging
it
is
that,
given
the
fact
that
there
is,
as
this
court
two
terms
ago
said
there
was,
a
first
amendment
right
to
attend,
then
something
more
than
the
desire
of
the
victim,
standing
alone,
or
a
private
session
has
to
be
demonstrated
before
the
presumptive
right
of
the
public
to
attend
can
be
overborne.
any
other
view
of
the
matter
puts
the
extent
of
the
press's
and
the
public's
first
amendment
rights
wholly
in
the
hands
of
someone
else,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
ever
interpreted
the
first
amendment
to
do.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
i'm
not
making
any
differentiation
here
between
the
right
of
the
press
and
the
right
of
the
public.
i
am
content
to
rest
on
the
rights
of
the
public,
but
surely
the
press
as
a
member
of
the
public
has
no
fewer
rights
under
the
first
amendment
than
does
the
public.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
i
don't--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
you
cannot
simply
achieve,
if
i
understand
what
the
statute
is
aimed
at,
a
flat
rule
that
simply
excludes
the
public
from
the
courtroom
during
the
victim's
testimony.
in
order
to
achieve
the
interests
that
the
commonwealth
apparently
seeks
to
achieve,
as
i
understand
those
interests,
one
would
in
effect
have
to
have
a
uniform
rule
closing
virtually
the
entirety
of
these
trials,
because
if
we
look
at
what
those
interests
are,
at
least
as
i
understand
them,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
predominant
interest
is
an
interest
in
privacy
of
some
kind.
now,
i
question
whether
privacy
really
is
a
relevant
concept
when
we
are
talking
about
this
kind
of
a
proceeding,
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
assuming
that
it
is,
and
if
we
further
look
at
what
is
inherent
in
the
notion
of
privacy,
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
is
involved,
what
the
commonwealth
is
attempting
to
protect,
is
some
restriction
on
the
dissemination
of
potentially
embarrassing
facts,
and
that
is
the
element
of
privacy
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
but...
might
not
be
given
in
evidence
by
the
victim--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--conceivably,
but
surely
even
if
given
by
the
victim,
are
very
likely
also
going
to
be
given
by
other
witnesses
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
and--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--no.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
to
me
one
has
to
start
first
with
what
the
statute
does
and
what
it
doesn't
do,
and
if
one
looks
at
that
distinction,
one
finds
that
this
is
a
statute
in
which
the
names
of
the
victims
are
part
of
the
public
record.
they
were
in
this
case.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
in
which
the
rest
of
the
trial
is
presumptively
open,
so
that
any
reports
given
by
the
victim
to
police
officers,
doctors,
mothers,
fathers
friends,
and
others,
are
going
to
be
presumptively
part
of
the
public
trial,
in
which
a
transcript
is
presumptively
going
to
be
available
to
the
public
at
some
point,
assuming
that
a
transcript
some
time
is
prepared.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
that
this
statute
encourages
victims
to
come
forward?
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
not
of
which
i
am
aware,
and
it
seem
to
me
that
this
is
really
a
leap
of
faith.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
it
has
been
on
the
books,
mr.
justice,
since
1931,
in
its
present
form.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
it
does
not.
there
are
really...
there
is
not
a
significant
amount
of
empirical
data,
survey
data,
if
you
will,
but
we
do
have
some
clues.
we
have
a
clue...
one
clue
is
a
case
called
commonwealth
versus
blondin,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
and
which
was
cited
in
a
footnote
in
mr.
justice
blackmun's
dissent
in
gannett,
which
was
really
the
first
case
to
construe
this
statute,
in
the
mid-forties,
and
that
was
a
statute...
that
was
a
case
which
put
the
question
whether
this
statute
was
constitutional,
and
in
that
case,
while
deciding
that
it
was
constitutional,
a,
because
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
that
the
sixth
amendment
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth,
and
b,
because
there
is
no
public
trial
guarantee
in
the
massachusetts
constitution,
the
court
was...
the
supreme
judicial
court
observed
that
from
the
trial
of
that
case
the
press
had
not
been
excluded,
and
went
on
to
raise
the
question
whether
indeed
the
press
could
be
excluded
under
any
constitutional
provisions
that
applied.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
that--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--they
are,
unless
everybody
consents
to
a
closure.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
that
has
not
been
a
question
which
has
been
tested.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
but
on
its
face--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--that's
correct,
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
mr.
justice,
that
statute
is
one
which
says
that
the
judge
may
close
the
trial.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
it
does
not,
like
this
statute,
require
him
to
do
so
if
everybody
agrees.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
would
raise
itself
questions--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--but
at
least
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
i
can't
predict
the
future,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
i
think
that
that
would
have
to
be
a
decision
made
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
in
the
main,
i
would
think
there
would
be--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
that's
conceivable.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
if
it
were
held...
a
blanket
rule
saying
that
all
of
these
preliminary
hearings
were
to
be
held
in
camera
or
in
the
chambers
or
out
of
the
public
view,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
suffer
from
many
of
the
defects
that
this
present
statute
suffers
from.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
but
i
do
not--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--i
am
sorry.
at
the
trial
or
at
the
preliminary
hearing
to
decide
whether
the
trial
was
to
be
open?
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
that
would
have
to...
i
would
have
difficulty
with
a
statute
which
said
that
in
blanket
fashion,
for
the
same
reasons
that
i
think
questions--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--must
be
held
in
public.
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
see
no
problem
with
that,
unless
substantial
reasons
are
advanced
to
support,
just
as
we
are
suggesting
here
they
should
be
asserted
in
particularized
fashion
to
support
closure
of
the
criminal
trial
or
a
portion
of
it
itself.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
i
would,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
in
the
same
breath
that
they
would
be
circumstances
in
which
some
substantial
concrete
showing
of
tangible
harm
to
that
particular
process,
to
that
particular
trial,
would
have
to
be
made.
we
are
not--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--yes,
that's
one
of
them.
an
inability,
a
demonstrated
inability
on
the
part
of
the
victim
to
testify.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
in
the
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
trial
is
to
be
open?
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
not
necessarily.
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
can
be
handled
without
even...
without
ever
getting
to
that
particular
problem
which
posed
a
particular
concern,
understandably,
i
think,
for
the
supreme
judicial
court,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mode
of
proceeding
with
respect
to
these
kinds
of
hearings
could
well
take
the
form
which
only
rarely,
if
ever,
got
to
examination
and
cross
examination
of
the
victim
by
anybody.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
hearing
of
the
type
that
would
suffice
in
most
cases
would
require,
first
of
all,
that
somebody
move
for
a
concrete
reason
that
the
hearing
be
closed,
rather
than
simply
presuming
from
the
outset
that
that
is
what
is
going
to
happen,
and
secondly,
that
somebody
demonstrate
and
articulate
some
concrete
reason,
based
on
the
evidence
that
is
expected
to
be
presented,
type
of
crime
that
is
involved,
the
age
and
maturity
of
the
victim,
the
victim's
prior
ability
to
deal
with--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
then,
those
who
oppose
closure
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
address
some
kinds
of
lesser
restrictions--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--no,
mr.
justice,
like--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
i
have
great
difficulty
with
assuming
that
in
order
to
exercise
one
constitutional
right,
one
should
be
required
to
enter
into
a
prior
restraint
situation.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
but
i
would--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--what
i
would
consider,
i
get
back
to
the
question
you
raised,
and
what
might
well
have
been
done
in
this
case,
and
indeed
in
most
cases,
is
to
address
the
concerns
of
the
victim.
what
is
it
really
that
bothers
the
victim?
is
it
the
part
about
where
she
is
going
to
identify
the
perpetrator?
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
you
might
well
put
the
victim
on
the
stand,
and
then
the
trial
judge,
depending
on
the
victim's
demeanor
and
ability
to
testify
at
that
hearing,
might,
for
example,
put
all
the
questions
to
the
victim
himself,
or
herself.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
i
would--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--i
would
suggest
that
presumptively
everybody
would
be
present.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
that's
what
i
read
the
first
amendment
rights
articulated
in
richmond
to
mean,
at
least
in
a
hypothetical
sense.
whether
that
is
a
practical
problem
or
not--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--i
say
it's
a
hypothetical
problem,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
it
highly
unlikely
that
in
any
case
of...
imaginable
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
populace
would
be
there
with
their
lawyers,
and
if
that
problem
arises--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--all
right,
let's
even
take
a
substantial
group,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
problem,
too,
can
be
handled
the
way
all
kinds
of
class
action
problems
are
handled
and
other
kinds
of
problems
are
handled.
you
appoint
lead
counsel,
somebody
to
ask
the
questions
to
the
judge
which
are
going
to
be
put
to
the
victim.
we're
not
suggesting
here,
and
i
don't
think
we
ever
have
suggested
that
this
preliminary
hearing
is
going
to
be
a
wide-open
free-for-all
in
which
everybody
is
going
to
be
permitted
to
go
out
and
get
their
own
experts
and
their
own
examination
and
their
own
cross
examination.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
hearing
has
to
take
into
account
in
some
form
of
sensitive
fashion
the
rights
at
issue,
and
if
we
come
to
a
situation
in
what
i
think
are
going
to
be
those
rare
situations
in
which
we
have
a
question
of
fact
which
has
to
be
resolved
in
order
to
make
the
decision
whether
closure
is
appropriate,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
trial
judge
in
careful
and
sensitive
fashion
can
handle
that
in
a
variety
of
ways,
and
one
of
those
ways
is
to
say
to
the
people
who
oppose
closure,
all
right,
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
ask
this
victim
about
her

tell
me,
and
i
will
determine
whether
or
not
i
am
going
to
ask
it
to
her.
another
way
would
be
to
have
the
victim
actually
examined
out
of
the
public
view,
but
with
a
two-way
communication
system,
so
that
people
could
hear
what
was
going
on.
justice
powell,
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
gannett,
suggested
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
those
who
oppose
closure
to
come
up
with
alternatives
if
an
impasse
or
a
problem
is
reached,
and
i
don't
back
away
from
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
both
with
some
sensitivity
and
some
creativity
and
the
technology
that
exists
we
can
come
up
with
those
kinds
of
alternatives
to
some
kind
of
a
free-for-all
situation,
and
really
that
that
ought
not
be
the
primary
concern.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue,
the
sole
issue
at
this--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--yes,
the
sole
issue
at
this
hearing,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be,
at
least
this
hearing
that
i
envision,
would
be
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
public
was
going
to
be
excluded
from
the
ensuing
trial,
so
that--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--in
my
view,
it
would,
presumptively.
presumptively.
nothing
is--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--but
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
problem
that
this
statute
closely
examined,
and
the
way
that
it's
been
interpreted
doesn't
in
any
meaningful
sense
preserve
privacy
in
the
first
place,
if
by
privacy
what
we
mean
is
preventing
the
dissemination
of
potentially
embarrassing
facts,
because
those
facts
are
going
to
get
out
in
every
case,
presumptively.
what
it
does,
and
all
it
does,
and
all
it
is
supposed
to
do,
and
that
is
the
bringing-forwardness
that
the
statute
has,
if
you
will,
all
it
is
supposed
to
do
is
close
the
courtroom
to
a
group
of
people
while
the
victim
is
on
the
stand,
not
prevent
anybody
from
discussing
or
otherwise
disseminating
what
the
victim
says
while
she
is
on
there,
or
he
is
on
there.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
or
publishing
a
transcript,
if
a
transcript
exists.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
i
believe
that
there
is
no
transcript,
and
in
the
normal
case
in
situations
at
least
in
massachusetts
a
transcript
is
not
customarily
prepared
unless
one
of
the
parties
requests
one
for
purposes
of
appeal.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
there
isn't,
but
the--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--not
in
the
ordinary
course.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
it
is
stenographically
recorded.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
there
is
no
law
against--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--i
believe
that
we
could
buy
one.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
that's
correct,
mr.
justice,
but
the
problem
is,
in
addition
to
the
problem
of
instant
availability,
is
what
i
should
have
said,
that--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--no,
i
could
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
not
in
massachusetts,
your
honor,
because
we
have
addressed
that
problem
in
massachusetts
through
the
so-called
rape
shield
laws,
of
a
type
which
are
burgeoning
throughout
the
country,
which
are
designed
to
head
off
that
kind
of
scenario
from
taking
place.
the
victim's
prior
sexual
history
and
a
whole
host
of
details
concerning
her
conduct
with
others
at
other
times
and
even
with
the
defendant
himself
at
other
times
is,
unless...
except
in
very
narrow
circumstances...
kept
out.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
it--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--yes,
it
does,
and--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
he
can,
but
according
to
the
supreme
judicial
court,
justice
marshal,
the
sealing
decision
or
the...
the
sealing
decision,
i
guess,
is
really
how
properly
to
view
it...
the
sealing
decision
is
to
be
based
on
the
factors
articulated
in
richmond
newspapers.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
we
have
difficult
problems
in
that
regard,
too,
because
a
whole
host
of
criminal
proceedings
are
sealed
up
and
bound
up
forever
once
the
criminal
trial
has
concluded.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
so
that
it
is
not
always
a
question
of
simply
going
to
the
courthouse
and
getting
a
copy
of
the
transcript.
if
your
honor
permits,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
the
suggestion,
to
begin
with,
that
this
statute
preserves
an
enclave
of
privacy
at
the
time
of
the
victim's
testimony,
i
suggest,
simply
misses
the
point.
under
commonwealth
and
marshall,
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
ruled
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
be
in
there
with
his
family
and
his
friends.
under
prior
decisions
and
under
the
statute
itself,
it
is
clear
that
the
jury
will
be
in
there.
the
judge
will
be
in
there,
and
a
host
of
other
people,
strangers
all
to
the
victim,
are
going
to
be
inside--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--with
respect
to
juvenile...
alleged
juvenile
delinquents?
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
oh,
no,
i'm
sorry.
it's
mandatory
in
all
cases
but
the
same
kinds
of
people
are
permitted
in.
that's
correct.
but
i
suggest
that
that
serves
a
very
different
purpose,
and
is
aimed
at
a
very
different
purpose
than
is
this
statute.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
they
are
not.
the
language
in
the
juvenile
statute
is
the
same.
those
with
a
direct
interest
in
the
case,
quote,
unquote,
may
attend.
all
of
those
people
may
attend
as
well.
but
the
notion
advanced
by
the
commonwealth
this
morning
and
in
its
brief
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
create
an
enclave
of
privacy,
and
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
it
just
doesn't
work
if
one
looks
at
the
operation
of
the
statute.
there
are
going
to
be
a
host
of
people
in
there
anyway,
under
all
circumstances,
even
if
the
courtroom
is
mandatorily
closed,
and
those
people
are
going
to
be
permitted
to
disseminate
under
the
statute
standing
by
itself
whatever
they
hear
in
that
courtroom,
and
in
terms
of
protecting
some
notion
of
privacy,
then,
the
statute
simply
is
not
going
to
work.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
from
were
does
that
trauma
come,
i
would
suggest
is
the
relevant
question,
given
the
numbers
of
people
who
are
already
going
to
be
in
there,
and--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--but
then
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--parents,
lawyer,
and
friends,
is
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
said.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
friends.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
there
has
only
been
one
case,
and
there
was
only
one
friend
in
that
case.
i
don't
know
how
far
the
court
would
take
that
principle,
but
that's
what
they've
said,
parents,
family,
and
friends,
and,
of
course,
lawyers.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
no,
i
am
back
to
the
adult,
in
this
case,
under
16(a),
this
statute,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
prosecuted
under--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--that's
correct,
in
one
of
these
cases.
indeed,
that
was
a
statute--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--and
friends.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
and
court
officials.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
but
even...
i
don't
believe
that
we
need
to
reach
that
question.
i
think
it
raises--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--well,
it
raises
extraordinarily
troublesome
problems,
i
would
suggest,
because
it
is
a
kind
of
prior
restraint,
and
in
order
to
exercise...
really
what
it
boils
down
to
again
is
the
kind
of
problem
we
are
talking
about
with
respect
to
imposing
that
kind
of
a
restraint
on
the
press.
in
order
to
exercise
his
public
trial
guarantee
in
some
form,
those
members
of
the
public
whom
the
defendant
has
attend
or
who
do
attend
have
to
consent
to
the
imposition
of
a
prior
restraint.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
not
necessarily,
because--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--i--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--no,
i
will
be
happy
to
tell
you
why
i
think
those
are
different,
because
what
we
are
asserting
here
is--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--into
the
videotaped
depositions?
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
i
would
think
that
we
would
not
try
to
get
into
those,
so
long
as
the
results
of
those
were
going
to
be
available
when
the
case
came
on
for
trial,
and
we
could
see
what
the
jury
could
see.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
because
the
transcript
only
captures,
i
suggest
to
you,
about
70
percent
of
the
evidence
that
the
victim--
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
--and
it's
not
instantaneous.
mr.
james
f.
mchugh,
iii
well,
it's
not
news,
and
it's
history,
and
it's
not
all
there,
mr.
justice.
we
don't
see
the
demeanor
of
the
witness.
we
don't
see
the
kinds
of
things
that
historically
have
been
used
by
juries
to
judge
who
is
telling
the
truth.
