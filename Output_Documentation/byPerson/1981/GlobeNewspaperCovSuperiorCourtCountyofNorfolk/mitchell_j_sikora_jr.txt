mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
several
questions
put
by
the
justices
to
my
brother.
mr.
justice
white
asked
about
the
availability
of
a
transcript
in
this
case,
and
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
the
globe
originally
sought
a
transcript.
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix
contains
the
motion
of
the
globe
that
a
transcript
be
made
available
in
this
case.
the
globe
did
not
follow
up
that
request
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
whether
there
are
any
empirical
data
which
show
the
effectiveness
of
the
massachusetts
statute,
and
i
agree
with
my
brother
that
there
are
not
conclusive
data.
on
the
other
hand,
by
way
of
background,
as
we
observe
in
our
brief,
rape
is
the
most
underreported
of
all
major
crimes
against
the
person
in
the
united
states,
and
it
is
estimated
authoritatively
that
only
two
out
of
seven
rapes
are
reported
in
the
country.
given
that
background,
and
given
certain
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
we
suggest
that
it
serves
an
eminently
rational
and
compelling
purpose.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
perhaps
i
misspoke.
i
meant
that
only
two
out
of
seven
are
reported.
that
is,
only
one
out
of
three
and
a
half.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
according
to
data
released
annually
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
rape
is
the
most
underreported
of
all
crimes,
because
of
several
of
its
inherent
features,
the
profound
embarrassment
and
inhibition
on
the
part
of
the
victim,
and
above
all,
her
dread
of
her
trial
appearance.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
suggestion
of
the
empirical
literature
of
the
last
15
years
is
that
there
is
a
peculiar
inhibition
about
testifying
in
front
of
a
crowd.
i
would
suggest
also,
your
honor,
that
testifying
in
a
courtroom
in
which
the
jury,
court
officers,
the
judge,
and
counsel
are
present
nonetheless
puts
all
of
them
within
the
enclosure
of
the
bar,
and
under
somewhat
of
a
controlled
setting,
that
is,
a
setting
controlled
by
the
trial
judge.
he
can
provide,
i
think,
a
more
protective
atmosphere
for
the
appearance
of
the
child.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
one
seeks
perfection
from
the
statute,
some
kind
of
airtight
anonymity
for
the
child,
and
some
type
of
perfect
laboratory
condition
for
her
testimony,
we
don't
purport
to
offer
it
through
this
statute.
it
is
a
reasonable
enclave
for
the
child
at
her
most
traumatic
moment
in
the
trial.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
your
honor,
there
are
two
other--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
not
precisely
of
this
kind.
there
are
two
other
states
which
compel
the
closure
of
certain
similar
proceedings,
i
believe.
iowa
requires
the
closure
of
paternity
trials.
west
virginia
requires
the
closure
of
divorce
trials.
there
are
four
states
which
permit
the
use
of
a
videotaping
device
in
lieu
of
the
child's
actual
testimony
at
trial,
and
those,
i
believe,
are
arizona,
new
mexico,
montana,
and
florida.
and
in
addition,
two
other
states
permit--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
is...
the
child
essentially
testifies
in
a
closed
setting--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
she
is
subject
to
direct
and
cross
examination.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
videotape
is
preserved,
and
then
shown
to
the
jury.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
statutes
don't
indicate
the
physical
locus
for
examination.
it
would
appear
to
us
that
it
would
be
either
in
chambers
or
perhaps
at
the
courthouse
several
weeks
before
trial.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
statutes
as
they
read
would
permit
any
kind
of
a
location,
so
long
as
the
essentials
of
direct
and
cross
examination
are
preserved.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor.
it
is
a
closed
setting.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
appears
that
he
would
be
present.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes.
it
is
literally
transplanted
or
plugged
into
the
trial.
in
addition,
two
states
permit
the
use
of
deposition
testimony
in
lieu
of
the
child's
testimony
alive
at
trial,
and
those
are
virginia
and
south
carolina.
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
asked
about
the
peripheral
offenses
involved
in
the
statute
in
particular.
the
statute
in
its
original
form
covered
trials
regarding
illegitimacy
and
non-support.
we
believe
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
now
excluded
those
offenses.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
and
i
believe
you
will
find
at
page
98
of
the
record
appendix,
footnote
11,
a
statement
by
the
court
that
its
holding
is
now
limited
only
to
the
crimes
involved
in
this
case,
and
they
were
forcible
rape
and
forced
unnatural
rape,
and
indeed,
the
entire
bulk
of
the
court's
reasoning
rests
for
the
most
part
on
a
body
of
empirical
literature
and
observations
of
the
past
15
years
which
center,
again,
on
the
crime
of
rape.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
we
would...
we
read
the
opinion
in
globe
ii
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
we
think
it
necessarily
means
that
much
because
of
the
reasoning
and
the
emphasis--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--upon
the
crime
of
forcible
rape.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
one
cannot
find
that
square
holding
beyond
the
footnote,
but
the
court
does--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--well,
i
think--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--i
believe
the
court
has
said
in
globe
ii
that
insofar...
that
trial
judges
will
now
be
guided
by
globe
ii,
and
by
richmond
newspapers,
and
that
statement
on
page
101
of
the
record
in
combination
with
the
essential
reasoning
which
emphasizes
the
role
of
rape
and
its
peculiar
physical
and
mental
injury
to
the
victim
leave
the
statute
in
effect
only
as
to
rape,
incest,
or,
i
believe,
carnal
abuse.
so
it
would
be
crimes
of
sexual
assault
as
to
which
the
statute
remains
constitutional
and
valid.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
all
three
were
minors.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
we
do
not--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--we
do
not,
your
honor.
the
trial
was
an
eight-day
trial,
and
we
do
know
that
there
were
a
number
of
witnesses,
approximately
12
to
14
witnesses
in
the
case,
that
the
two
main
issues
of
the
case
were
identification
of
the
defendant
and
a
certain
amount
of
alibi
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
there
were
six
alibi
witnesses,
and
that
appeared
to
be
a
crucial--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor,
although
it
appears
to
have
been
unavoidable
because
of
really
the
flow
of
constitutional
doctrine.
the
trial
took
place
in
april
of
1979,
two
months
before
gannett.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
i
suppose
you
are
determining
whether
its
preservation
of
the
core
of
this
statute
for
the
future,
prospectively.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
believe
he
did,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
they
were,
your
honor.
there
were
three
witnesses
who
were
waitresses,
whom
he
called
as
alibi
witnesses
to
put
him
at
a
particular
restaurant
during
or
about
the
time
of
the
crime.
there
were
two
other
witnesses
who
testified
that
one
of
those
waitresses
was
with
them
and
not
at
the
restaurant,
and
the
victim's
father
testified
that
he
was
at
home
that
night.
the
victim
himself
testified
and
recounted
the
chronology
of
his
doings
that
night.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
at
various
times.
he
accounted
for
the
duration
of
his
evening,
so
that
he
would
not
have
been
present
at
the
site
of
the
crime.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--yes.
i
believe
i
can,
your
honor.
i
believe
you
will
find
it
at
page
18.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
after
all
this
work,
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
render
a
decision.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--we
have
treated...
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
the
globe
and
the
commonwealth
have
treated
the
decision
as...
or
the
events
as
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
in
light
of--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
suppose
it
is
not
unlike
that
case,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
more
like
gannett
and
richmond
newspapers.
we
have
an
acquittal
here
as
in
richmond
newspapers--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--literally,
the--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
believe
literally
the
judgment
is
a
dismissal
of
the
globe's
petition
seeking
extraordinary
interlocutory
review
of
the
trial
judge's
entire
order.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
essentially,
the
statute
as
it
was
preserved
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
both
globe
i
and
globe
ii
is
at
stake
here.
in
a
very
real
sense,
if
the
court
holds
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
was
mistaken,
the
statute
goes
down,
there
is
no
statute
to
this
effect
in
the
commonwealth.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
contains
one
main
verb,
and
the
main
verb
is
imperative.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
rest
of
the
trial,
will
remain
open.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it's--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--oh,
i
see.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
there
would
remain
an
inherent
common
law
power
on
the
part
of
trial
judges
for
good
reasons,
supported
by
findings,
to
close
all
or
part
of
trials
in
accordance,
i
believe,
with
richmond
newspapers
and
in
accordance
with
what
in
massachusetts
has
been
called
a
common
law
principle
of
publicity
for
criminal
trials.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
hypothetically,
if
there
were
some
compelling
reason
why,
say,
the
testimony
of
perhaps
a
young
witness
to
a
burglary
should
be
sheltered,
a
judge
would
hold
a
hearing,
make
that
finding,
and
issue
a
reason
and
close
it,
could
in
his
discretion
if
the
circumstances
were--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--that's
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
is
mandated
to
close
the
testimony
of
children
under
18.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
with
regard
to
state
law,
mr.
justice,
for
some
reason,
john
adams
did
not
include
in
the
massachusetts
constitution
a
provision
for
public
trials,
and
perhaps
that
was
because
it
was
so
settled
in
common
law
doctrine
at
that
time.
as
a
consequence,
the
principle
of
publicity
for
criminal
trials
in
massachusetts
has
always
been
a
common
law
doctrine
and
a
matter
of
state
law
enforced
by
the
supreme
judicial
court.
in
the
course
of
my
brother's
argument,
i
believe
he
took
false
aim
at
the
main
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
main
purpose
of
the
statute
is
not
to
confer
a
generalized
privacy
upon
the
victim.
essentially
the
purpose
is
to
give
her
some
protection
against
the
trauma
of
her
testimony
at
trial.
further,
through
that
kind
of
assurance
by
means
of
a
mandatory
statute,
the
legislature
attempts
to
bring
forward,
to
encourage
the
reporting
and
the
prosecution
of
this
particular
category
of
crime.
again,
this
particular
category
of
crime
is
characterized
by
a
reluctance
of
victims,
especially
young
victims
and
their
families,
to
come
forward
and
to
endure
the
process
of
the
prosecution.
a
number
of
the
students
of
this
subject
have
suggested
that
the
criminal
justice
system
itself
ironically
imposes
a
second
round
of
physical
and
psychological
pain
upon
the
victim.
indeed,
a
number
of
the
writers
recount
the
ordeal
of
a
victim,
a
young
victim
and
her
family
as
they
approach
the
trial
process
itself.
typically,
the
victim
will
have
to
visit
the
police
station,
the
district
attorney's
office,
identification,
go
through
identification
procedures,
and,
of
course,
at
the
time
of
trial
itself
confront
the
alleged
rapist
and
undergo
cross
examination.
typically,
too,
the
victim
will
experience
a
number
of
trial
continuances,
and
this
will
protract
her
inhibition,
her
embarrassment,
and
very
often
it
will
cost
the
prosecution
the
value
of
her
assistance.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that
was
not
available
in
the
data
which
we
examined,
your
honor.
we
have
derived
our
data
from
two
main
sources.
one
was
the
study
of
the
presidential
commission
on
crime
of
1967,
and
the
other
was
annual
federal
bureau
of
investigation
reports
on
the
incidence
of
crime
in
the
united
states.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
does
not--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--yes,
and
that
is
certainly
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
case.
we
say
that
there
are
at
least
three
reasons--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--he
could
not.
he
could
not,
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
cited
several
reasons
why
he
could
not
and
should
not.
the
first
essentially
is
an
assertion
of
parens
patriae
power
of
the
state.
the
state
is
entitled
to
be
wary
of
a
family
or
a
victim
which
feels
confident
enough
to
undergo
cross
examination
or
confrontation
at
a
public--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--there
would
still
be
no
right
of
waiver.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
we
rely
particularly
upon
several
decisions
of
this
court,
one
of
which
is
prince
versus
massachusetts,
a
1944
decision
in
which
the
court
held
that
a
child,
even
with
the
accompaniment
of
a
parent
or
guardian,
and
even
though
the
child
sincerely
held
the
religious
beliefs
involved,
could
not
participate
in
street
pamphleting
or
prosyletizing
in
behalf
of
her
religious
views,
and
the
court
used
rather
strong
language
as
to
permissibility
of
parents
exposing
their
children
to
particular
activities
which
they
felt
strong
enough
to
endure
themselves.
the
majority
said,
"parents
may
be
free
to
become
martyrs
themselves.
"
even
a
psychiatrist
or
a
college
president,
i
would
submit,
"but
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
free
in
identical
circumstances
to
make
martyrs
of
their
children
before
they
have
reached
the
age
of
full
and
legal
discretion--
"
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--testifying
at
a
trial
which
is
called
to
resolve
the
question
whether
you
have
been
raped,
if
you
are
a
child,
eight,
ten,
or
twelve
years
old,
i
think
is
analogous.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
and
the
answer,
i
think,
is--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--the
answer,
i
think,
your
honor,
even
for
that--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--even
for
that
extraordinary
individual
must
be
no,
for
several
very
practical
reasons.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
naturally
we
would
have
to
make
that
point.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
and
cite
justice
holmes,
as
always,
for
it,
but
in
addition,
this
is
not
an
experience,
testifying
at
a
trial
of
rape,
even
for
a
mature
minor,
even
for
an
adult
woman,
which
provides
the
victim
with
any
realistic
opportunity
for
preparation,
for
rehearsal,
for
prior
experience.
it
is
a
traumatic
event
as
much
for
the
adult
perhaps
as
for
the
child.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
is
not
one
of
those
events
that
changes
the
quality
radically
as
one
passes
from
adolescence
to
adulthood,
and
again--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--in
that
hypothetical,
your
honor,
identification...
i
am
assuming
that
identification
is
the
issue
on
which
guilt
or
innocence
would
hinge,
and
apart,
though,
from
the
character
of
the
crucial
issue
in
the
case,
a
minor
would
still
under
this
statute
be
given
sheltered
testimony.
if
i
may,
justice
marshal,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
your
question
and
wrestle
with
it
a
little
more.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
think
there
is
a
second
dimension
to
the
reason
why
the
state
should
not
permit
even
the
willing
minor
or
her
family
to
expose
her
to
public
testimony,
and
that
is
the
interest
of
the
government
in
the
quality
of
her
testimony.
the
government
as
an
institution
has
a
special
interest
in
the
accuracy,
the
reliability
of
her
testimony.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
absolutely,
but
at
least
that
communication
would
take
place
outside
the
very
special
setting
of
a
criminal
trial
to
determine
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
it
would
take
place
out
of
the
viewing
of
a
jury.
it
is
that
precise
circumstance
of
testifying
in
front
of
a
jury
with
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
defendant
at
stake
that
makes
her
testimony
very
precious
stuff,
and
makes
us
want
as
much
as
possible
to
assure
its
reliability
and
accuracy.
and
incidentally,
note
that
that
concern
about
the
quality
of
her
testimony
leads
as
much
to
exculpatory
evidence
as
in
this
case,
the
victim
was
acquitted...
i'm
sorry,
the
accused
was
acquitted...
as
it
does
to
inculpatory
evidence
that
would
lead
to
just
convictions.
it
is
a
just
result,
acquittal
or
conviction,
which
is
the
special
concern
of
the
state,
and
the
state,
we
say,
may
pre-empt
the
risk
of
even
a
mature
minor
who
has
abundant
confidence
in
her
ability
to
testify
effectively,
the
state
may
pre-empt
the
risk
of
her
appearance
in
front
of
a
full
courtroom
containing
members
of
the
press
in
a
situation
in
which
she
might
succumb
to
stress
or
otherwise
compromise
her
testimony,
compromise
the
quality
of
that
testimony.
there
is
perhaps
one...
and
a
third
dimension
to
the
answer
on
waiver,
your
honor,
and
that
is
very
simply
that
even
a
waiver
offer
by
the
victim
would
require
probably
some
kind
of
hearing
on
the
part
of
a
trial
judge
to
assure
himself
that
her
waiver
was
knowing,
voluntary,
and
wise
or
intelligent.
in
those
circumstances,
again,
the
victim
is
drawn
into
another
preliminary
hearing
at
which
the
issue
is
her
capacity
to
testify
and
perhaps
her
psychological
strength
or
stamina.
again,
there
is
a
pulling
and
hauling
over
the
psyche
of
the
child
victim
even
before
the
trial
begins.
this
in
particular
persuaded
the
supreme
judicial
court
that
preliminary
hearings
on
waiver
would
themselves
begin
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
missed
the
last
word.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
see.
they
are
entirely
closed,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
believe
the
age
is
14,
and
there
is
a
period
between
14
and
16
in
which--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct,
although
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
victim
would
be
14
would
be
conclusive
as
to
her
testimony.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
for
the
accused.
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
stress
just
one
more
point,
and
that
is
a
mode
of
analysis
which
mr.
justice
brennan
introduced
in
the
richmond
newspapers
case,
when
he
suggested
that
we
should
test
statutes
of
this
kind
by
inspection
as
to
whether
they
interfere
seriously
with
the
flow
of
information
to
citizens
about
their
courts
or
about
their
political
institutions
more
generally.
i
believe
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
tried
very
hard
to
shrink
this
statute
to
fit
its
essential
purpose.
indeed,
if
we
examine
the
remainder
of
the
trial
open
to
the
public,
it
is
very
considerable.
all
pre
and
post-trial
proceedings
remain
open,
presumptively
open.
empanelment
of
the
jury,
opening
remarks,
testimony
of
all
other
witnesses,
and
typically
there
are
five
other
categories
of
witnesses...
police,
medical
and
scientific
evidence,
prosecution
corroboration
witnesses,
defense
evidence
and
defense
corroboration
and
alibi
witnesses...
in
addition,
summation
to
the
jury,
jury
instructions,
rendition
of
the
verdict,
all
court
papers,
the
appellate
process,
all
of
these
elements
of
the
judicial
process
remain
open
to
the
public.
my
brother
suggested
that
the
statute
might
be
self-defeating
because
it
left
so
much
of
the
proceeding
open,
but
again,
if
one
zeroes
in
on
the
very
precise
purpose
of
the
statute,
simply
to
give
the
child
an
enclave
at
the
moment
of
testimony,
i
think
one
grasps
the
true
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
appreciates
the
effort
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
to
leave
the
remainder
of
the
trial
and
the
judicial
proceeding
all
but
entirely
open.
just
to
sum
up
then,
we
suggest
that
on
other
occasions
the
press
itself
has
recognized
the
social
value
of
some
confidentiality,
particularly
in
cases
or
in
legislation
where
it
sought
to
shield
the
identity,
for
example,
of
reporters'
sources,
and
argued
that
such
confidentiality
produced
socially
beneficial
results.
today,
the
government
is
arguing
that
some
reasonable
confidentiality
for
children,
victim
to
crimes
of
sexual
assault,
serves
equally
important
purposes.
we
believe
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
decision
below
respects
both
values,
both
the
purposes,
the
practical
and
humane
purposes
of
the
statute,
and
the
first
amendment.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
that
judgment.
thank
you.
