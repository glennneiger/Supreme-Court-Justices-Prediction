unknown
speaker
do
you
mean,
mr.
mchugh,
by
required,
the
fact
it
is
mandated,
that
no
matter
what
the
witnesses
may
desire,
and
what
the
parties
may
desire,
the
court
must
close
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
then,
i
am
a
little
puzzled
when
you
reach
the
proposition
you
advance
that
you...
it
is
not
only
bad
on
its
face
but
as
applied.
unknown
speaker
now,
as
applied
here,
you
say
that
even
if
the
statute
were
discretionary,
you
would
be
here.
unknown
speaker
i
notice
in
your
brief
you
suggest
that
there
was
no
question
raised
by
the
complaining
witness.
do
you
think
that
is
quite
an
accurate
characterization
of
the
complaining
witness?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
complaining
witness's
position
about
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
pretty
clear
that
if
her
privacy
could
be
guaranteed,
then
she
would
have
no
objection.
now,
could
her
privacy
be
guaranteed
in
any
other
way
than
what
was
done
here?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
understood,
mr.
mchugh,
in
your
answer
to
me,
it
would
not...
what
was
the
need
for
a
hearing?
as
i
understood
it,
the
trial
judge,
under
the
statute,
if
he
is
to
follow
it,
has
absolutely
no
choice.
he
has
to
close
the
courtroom.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
he
has
to
ask
reporters,
he
has
to
ask
the
public,
he
has
to
ask
everyone
to
get
out
except
the
parties.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
this
statute
accordingly
is
unconstitutional
because
it
makes
no
provision
for
such
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
had
held
a
hearing,
and
explored
whatever
anyone
wanted
to
explore
within
reason,
and
then
said,
in
case
anyone
thinks
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
as
being
overbroad,
i
now
address
the
question
of
whether
i
would...
what
i
would
do
if
i
read
the
statute
as
giving
me
discretion,
and
under
that
discretion
i
would
exclude
all
persons
during
this
particular
component,
section
of
the
trial.
would
you
still
be
here?
unknown
speaker
so
even
with
discretion,
you
would
challenge.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
case
you
are
referring
to,
did
we
not
suggest
that
the
right
is
the
right
of
the
public,
and
the
press
included
as
a
component
of
the
public.
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
mchugh,
if
you
are
going
to
preserve
the
interests
that
the
commonwealth
seeks
to
preserve
here,
isn't
it
either
a
flat
rule
or
no
rule--
unknown
speaker
--because
if
you
are
going
to
obtain
testimony
from
witnesses
in
situations
like
this,
isn't
the
prosecutor
going
to
have
to
offer
them
some
assurance
at
the
outset
that
their
testimony
will
be
not
exposed
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
the
facts
that
might
not
be
given
in
evidence
were
it
not
for
some
sort
of
protection.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
realistic,
counsel,
in
crimes
of
rape
of
children
or
sexual
abuse?
they
don't
usually
occur
in
the
presence
of
other
witnesses--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
problem,
of
course,
is
trying
to
make
sure
that
the
state
as
a
policy
doesn't
discourage
victims
of
these
crimes
from
coming
forward
in
the
first
place
and
making
a
complaint
simply
because
of
the
trauma
that
they
will
go
through
if
forced
to
testify
in
public
about
it.
now,
how
do
you
balance
those
interests?
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
do
you
balance
those
interests?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
make
a
good
bit
of
to
do
about
encouraging
victims
to
come
forward.
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
by
way
of
study
that
supports
that
kind
of
a
statement?
unknown
speaker
that
in
fact
a
statute
of
this
kind
does
encourage
victims
to
come
forth.
has
there
been
any
empirical
study
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
this
statute
been
on
the
books,
mr.
mchugh?
unknown
speaker
that
means
that
for
this
kind
of
crime,
then,
there
has
never
been
an
open
trial
in
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
this
applies
only
where
there
is
a
minor
under
18
years
of
age
who
is
the
victim?
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
is
at
least
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
trials
of
victims
over
18
are
open
to
the
public,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
like
who,
you
mean
the
press?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--so
it
really...
you
are
really
saying
that
unless
the
defense
and
the
prosecution
and
the
judge
agree.
unknown
speaker
but
neither
the
public
nor
the
press
would
be
consulted
in
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
know,
but
the
judge
could
close
it
without
consulting
either
the
press
or
the
public
if
prosecution
and
defense
agreed.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may,
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
expect
in
that
circumstance
if
a
reporter
for
the
globe
was
asked
to
leave
the
courtroom,
we
might
have
a
test
of
that,
might
we
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mchugh,
maybe
i
missed
it,
but
at
this
hearing
you
want,
would
the
press
be
barred
from
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
would
think
it
would
be
like
a
voir
dire
hearing.
it
could
be
in
the
judge's
chambers.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
hearing
satisfy
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
place
of
that
the
rule
was
that
the
judge
can
hold
an
in
camera
hearing
from
which
the
public
is
excluded.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
voir
dire
that
has
nothing...
it
will
not
be
in
the
trial
at
all.
it's
just
like
any
other
voir
dire.
that
is
the
purpose
of
it,
not
being
in
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
it's
like
a
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
you
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mchugh,
if
the
procedure
involved
were
one
that
were
not
mandatory,
and
a
hearing
would
be
conducted,
would
you
concede
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
which
would
justify
closing
the
testimony
to
the
press
and
public
of
a
minor
victim
in
a
sex
crime?
unknown
speaker
such
as
what,
that
the
victim
feels
she
just
can't
testify?
unknown
speaker
subject
to
cross
examination
at
the
hearing
by
counsel
for
the
newspaper
or
whoever
was
there?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
prosecutor
comes
in
and
moves
just
what
you
said,
that
this
is
a
15-year-old
girl
who
is
going
to
testify
that
she
has
been
raped,
and
she
is
unwilling
to
testify
unless
there
can
be
some
exclusion
of
the
public
and
the
press
at
the
time
she
testifies.
what
more
would
be
required?
unknown
speaker
like
gag
orders,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
well,
allowing
the
public
to
be
present
and
the
press
to
be
present,
but
under
some
kind
of
restraint
against
disclosing
in
the
next
day's
newspaper
what
happened.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
not
consider
that,
at
least,
as--
unknown
speaker
--an
acceptable
lesser--
unknown
speaker
--how
would
you
get
at
that
as
a
practical
matter?
wouldn't
you
put
the
victim
on
the
stand?
i
mean,
you
can't
conduct
it
by
a
colloquy
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
attorney
for
the
globe,
certainly.
unknown
speaker
who
is
present
at
this
hearing--
unknown
speaker
--when
this
is
happening?
unknown
speaker
is
every
one
of
the
public
in
boston
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
there?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
real
practical
problem,
isn't
it?
on
what
basis
would
the
globe
be
there
if
every
other
citizen
of
boston
couldn't
be
there?
unknown
speaker
maybe
not
the
vast
majority,
but
let's
say
100
of
them
asked
to
come
in.
unknown
speaker
in
this
hearing,
this
preliminary
hearing,
would
it
be
your
view
that
the
defense
could
cross
examine
the
victim
to
determine
whatever
it
was
he
was
after,
defense
counsel?
unknown
speaker
now,
this
is
all
before
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
you
had
said
before
the
public
would
have
to
be
present
at
that
hearing.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
left
of
the
privacy
that
presumptively
was
one
of
the
factors
underlying
this
statute
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
or
publishing
a
transcript.
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
rule
against
the
press
buying
a
transcript?
unknown
speaker
isn't
a
transcript
made?
unknown
speaker
is
it
recorded?
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
you
buy
one
if
you
wanted
to?
is
there
a
law
against
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
buy
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
law
then
against
your
buying
one
and
publishing
it.
unknown
speaker
you
certainly...
well,
i'll
put
it
as
a
question.
would
you
say
that
it
is
a
reasonable
proposition
that
in
this
type
of
case,
particularly
the
rape
case,
that
what
happens
as
a
practical
matter
is
that
the
defense
is
an
attack
on
the
complaining
witness,
and
the
trial
often
becomes
converted
into
a
trial
of
the
complaining
witness,
at
least
as
much
as
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
then
massachusetts
follows
the
proposition
from
what
you
say
that
even
a
prostitute
may
be
a
rape
victim--
unknown
speaker
--and
a
complaining
witness.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
statute
reaches
more
than
indictments
for
rape,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
is
also
non-support
of
an
illegitimate
child.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mchugh,
on
the
record
point,
the
transcript,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
released.
the
judge
can
seal
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
had
one
from
another
state
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
where
a
grown
man
had
sealed
his
record
because
he
didn't
want
to
be
known
as
going
before
the
grand
jury,
so
i
think
if
he
can
get
it,
i
thought
a
child,
but
i
realize
that
is
state
by
state.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
is
correct,
that
two
out
of
seven
are
unreported.
does
that
mean
that
the
greater
percentage
of
burglaries
are
not
reported?
unknown
speaker
well,
without
using
my
figures,
does
that
mean
the
same
thing
is
not
true
with
respect
to
other
crimes,
particularly
in
the
inner
city?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
embarrassment
just
as
great
in
a
closed
courtroom
as
in
an
open
one?
she
is
bound
to
be
cross
examined.
there
are,
i
assume,
in
your
courtrooms
in
massachusetts
a
lot
of
unrelated
to
her
persons
in
that
courtroom.
isn't
the
reluctance
just
that
of
testifying
at
all,
rather
than
testifying
in
an
open
court
as
distinguished
from
a
closed
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
some
of
those,
in
our
cases,
have
talked
a
lot
and
have
interfered
with
the
judicial
process
on
occasion.
this
morning
we
had
a
case
about...
or
alluded
to,
anyway,
where
bailiffs
had
misbehaved.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sikora,
is
there
any
other
state
in
the
united
states
with
a
similar
statute
of
mandatory
exclusion?
unknown
speaker
to
your
knowledge?
unknown
speaker
how
do
those
work,
mr.
sikora?
unknown
speaker
in
camera,
in
chambers
or
something,
in
like
an
interview
with
the
judge,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
she
is.
unknown
speaker
but
where
is
the
child
examined,
in
chambers
or
something?
unknown
speaker
not
just
like
a
deposition,
it
could
be
in
a
lawyer's
office?
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
exclude
people
from
that
examination?
unknown
speaker
would
the
judge
be
present?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
and
counsel,
prosecutor
and
defense,
and
the
accused.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
all.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it
would
be
just
like
the
trial,
except
it
is
before
the
formal
trial
actually
opens.
unknown
speaker
but
then
the
videotape
becomes
part
of
the
trial,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
public?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
and
decision,
i
gather,
apply
only
to
the
crime
of
rape,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
other
categories
have
been
written
out
of
the
statute,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
in
effect
that
as
applied
to
these
other
offenses,
your
court
has
in
effect
said
the
provision
will
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
couldn't
write
out
of
the
statute
these
other
categories.
unknown
speaker
other
than
by
declaring
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
constitutional.
yes.
may
i
ask
a
question
about
exactly
what
is
before
us?
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
decision
in
globe
ii,
the
trial
court's
order
was
an
improper
order,
because
it
closed
the
entire
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
say
it
should
be,
in
effect,
that
more
of
the
order
should
be
set
aside.
i
take
it
the
part
that
remained
valid
is
the
part
that
excluded
the
public
from
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
of
the
victims,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
all
three.
unknown
speaker
and
do
we
have
a
transcript
so
we
would
know
how
much
of
the
entire
trial
was
therefore...
the
public
was
denied
access
to--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
order?
unknown
speaker
so
we
should
judge
the
case
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
order
had
permitted
the
press
to
attend
all
but
two
or
three
witnesses'
testimony.
unknown
speaker
that's
kind
of
a
strange
appellate
posture
for
a
decision
on
this
kind
of
an
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
bottom
line,
we
are
reviewing
a
trial
court
order
that
has
already
been
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
but
even
preserving
the
core
of
the
statute
doesn't
preserve
the
trial
court
order
that
gave
rise
to
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
and
the
particular
order
that
was
entered
will
never
recur
again
in
massachusetts.
unknown
speaker
did
the
defendant
testify?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suspect
if
it
is
something
else,
that
these
multiple
witnesses
were
alibi
witnesses
and
perhaps
character
witnesses
for
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
so
he
was
both
at
the
restaurant
and
at
home
on
the
defendant's
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mchugh,
after
your...
mr.
sikora,
sorry,
forgive
me.
after
your
discussion
with
my
brother
stevens,
what
order
is
actually
before
us?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
can
you
point...
tell
me
where
it
is
in
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
really
care
if
we
review
it,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
we
review
judgments,
and
i
am
just
wondering
what
judgment
are
we
reviewing.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
review
opinions.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
same
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
so
that
that
saves
it
from
being
moot.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
unlike
nebraska
press
association
versus
stewart
in
that
regard.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
still
bothers
me,
mr.
sikora.
what
do
we
affirm
and
what
do
we
reverse?
unknown
speaker
look
at
page
108a.
is
that
what
we
are
here
for?
it
says
the
judgement
of
june
30,
1981.
does
that
help
you
any?
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
on
page
108.
i
know,
but
where
is
the
judgment.
that's
the
trouble.
where
is
the
"judgement
of
june
30,
1981?
"
unknown
speaker
the
only
consequence...
suppose
your
friend
prevailed.
would
the
only
consequence
be
that
the
next
time
they
have
this
precise
kind
of
case,
that
it
can't
be
closed
without
a
hearing,
at
least?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
it
might
be
closed
out
for
hearing
and
it
might
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
non-discretionary,
the
mandatory
aspect
of
this
statute
severable
from
the
rest
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
it
stands
or
falls
altogether.
unknown
speaker
but
only
with
respect
to
the
victim's
testimony.
unknown
speaker
you
would
anticipate
that
in
another
case
there
would
be
a
closure
order
for
the
victim's
testimony?
unknown
speaker
but
the
closure
order
would
be
a
matter
of
discretion.
unknown
speaker
no,
if
the
statute
were
stricken.
unknown
speaker
if
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--striking
this
statute
as
unconstitutional,
you
suggest
that
would
have
any
effect
on
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
that
has
been
intimated
in
some
cases?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
basically
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts,
would
it
not,
as
to
whether
the
statutes
remaining
or
the
common
law
powers
of
the
massachusetts
courts
extended
to
that?
it
is
nothing
this
court
would
have
anything
to
say
about.
unknown
speaker
do
the
common
laws,
mr.
sikora,
extend,
say,
to
burglary
trials?
unknown
speaker
but
as
to
these
offenses
under
this
statute,
he
doesn't
have
to
go
through
that
procedure.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sikora,
you
said
earlier
that
only
two
of
seven
are
reported.
how
many
of
the
two
ever
actually
go
to
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
this
also
prohibits
one
who
has
no
objection.
unknown
speaker
that's
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
this
statute,
can
the
judge
say
that
since
this
complainant
witness
does
not
object,
her
family
does
not
object,
the
minister
doesn't
object,
i
am
going
to
open
it?
could
he
do
that
in
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
mother
was
a
psychiatrist
and
the
father
was
a
college
president.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
do
you
consider
testifying
at
trial
being
a
martyr?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
child
from
my
hypothetical
is
17
years,
350
days
old.
that
is
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
attending
one
of
the
ivy
league
colleges.
unknown
speaker
it's
hard.
it's
hard
to
answer.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
retreat
to
the
point
that
you
have
to
draw
a
line
some
place,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
agree.
unknown
speaker
suppose,
counsel,
that
this
pretrial
exploration
of
the
matter
that
we
referred
to
before
developed
the
fact
that
the
defense
was
entirely
alibi,
that
he
wasn't
in
boston,
he
was
in
philadelphia
for
a
whole
week
before
and
after.
would
a
trial
court
be
sustained
in
refusing
to
permit
cross
examination
on
any
issue
except
identification?
is
there
any
other
issue
in
the
case
then
except
identification
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
yes.
it
worries
me,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
other
hand,
she
could
go
to
the
newspaper,
get
a
tv
camera,
sit
down
in
front
of
them
and
testify,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
you
could
do
to
stop
it.
unknown
speaker
general,
how
does
massachusetts
handle
this
problem
in
the
trial
of
juveniles?
unknown
speaker
how
does
massachusetts
handle
the
problem
we
are
discussing
here
today
in
criminal
trials
of
juveniles?
unknown
speaker
mandatorily
so?
unknown
speaker
to
what
age?
unknown
speaker
they
may
be
tried
as
adults.
unknown
speaker
that's
fairly
standard
among
the
states,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
have
a
16-year-old
defendant
and
a
14-year-old
victim,
and
these
two
statutes
would
interact
with
one
another.
unknown
speaker
yes.
mandatory
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
it
was
mandatory
up
to
14
on
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
and
discretionary
from
14
to
16?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
defendant
is
aged
12,
is
the
statute
mandatory
on
everyone?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
he
can't
have
his
mother
or
father
or
his
brother
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
i've
got
your
answer
clear.
it
may
or
may
not
be
important.
a
juvenile,
aged
12
or
13,
on
trial,
are
his
parents
excluded?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
it's
not
so
much
privacy
as
it
is
just
protection
against
the
trauma,
the
trauma
of
testifying
before
the
public.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
jury,
but
there
are
certain...
besides
the
jury,
there's
not
a
host
of
people.
i
mean,
the
defendant
can't
have
all
of
his
friends
from
the
neighborhood
in
there.
unknown
speaker
he
has
his
parents.
who
else?
his
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
friends?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
all
the
friends
he
has?
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
talking
about
the
juvenile?
unknown
speaker
even
an
adult--
unknown
speaker
--defines
offenses
covered
by
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
a
minimum,
in
any
event,
number
of
people,
the
jury,
the
judge,
counsel,
both
sides,
the
accused,
and
his
father,
mother,
brothers,
sisters,
and
friends,
whatever
that
means.
unknown
speaker
and
court
officials.
unknown
speaker
could
the
court
under
your
theory
of
the
case
impose
an
order
on
them
that
they
could
not
speak
of
the
proceedings
until
after
the
verdict?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
we
don't
need
to.
i
am
just
interested
in
your
position.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
just
one
more...
i
suppose
if
you
prevailed
in
this
you
would
certainly
request
to
get
into
the
videotaped
deposition
type
of
hearings.
unknown
speaker
i
know
not
necessarily,
but
what
is
the
probability?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
needn't
answer
that
if
you
don't
want
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
differ,
would
you
think
it
is
probable
you
would
try
to
get
into
those,
too,
or
not?
that's
my
question.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
wouldn't
you
be
satisfied
with
a
transcript
of
the
entire
trial
after
the
verdict
comes
in?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
only
that,
it
is
not
instantaneous.
unknown
speaker
so
that
when
you
get
that,
it
is
not
news,
it
is
history.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o
clock.
