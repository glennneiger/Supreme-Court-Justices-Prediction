mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
found
contributory
infringement
in
the
trade
name
cyclospasmol.
i'd
like
to
explain
why.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
this
case
presents
important
questions
as
to
federal
competition
policy,
on
the
one
hand
between
the
policy
favoring
product
imitation,
which
will
ultimately
hopefully
allow
for
reduced
prices
to
consumers;
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
federal
policy
favoring
competition
by
product
differentiation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
states
so
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
senate
report
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
it
is
certainly
one
aspect
of
the
federal
policy
favoring
competition
by
product
differentiation,
so
long
as
there
is
a
distinctive
trademark
or
so
long
as
the
company
that
is
seeking
the
protection
has
established
that
the
symbol
it
seeks
to
protect
has
acquired
in
the
minds
of
consumers
an
identification
with
the
producer.
now,
in
this
case
the
only
trademark
that's
involved
is
the
name
cyclospasmol,
and
any
claim
of
infringement
under
section
32
must
be
rooted
in
the
misuse
of
that
particular
word.
keeping
this
as
a
central
fact
in
the
case
in
mind,
we
approach
the
issues
presented
under
the
legal
standard
described
by
judge
friendly
in
the
first
appeal
in
this
case
and
nominally
applied
by
the
majority
in
the
second
appeal.
now,
that
standard
that
judge
friendly
announced
has
been
referred
to
by
counsel.
we
contend
that
the
problem
with
the
majority's
opinion
on
the
second
appeal
is
that
in
effect
it
read
the
intent
element
out
of
the
standard
and
found
liability
on
a
lesser
showing
that
petitioners
merely
facilitated
infringement.
in
addition,
there
was
error
in
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion...
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
as
to
the
standard
of
appellate
review.
they
did
not
find
that
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
were
clearly
erroneous.
rather,
the
words
they
used
were
"unconvincing"
and
"unpersuasive".
that,
we
submit,
is
not
an
appropriate
standard
for
reversing
findings
of
fact.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
on
the
second
appeal,
there
was
indeed
evidence
of
trademark
infringement
by
a
small
number
of
retail
druggists.
however,
the
record
is
absent
any
proof
that
the
petitioners
in
fact
suggested
or
implied
this
course
of
conduct
to
the
druggists.
to
the
contrary,
the
record
does
support,
and
the
district
court
found,
that
the
generic
manufacturers
label
their
bottles
only
with
the
generic
name
cyclandelate,
never
with
the
trade
name
cyclospasmol.
and
each
bottle
manufactured
by
the
manufacturing
petitioners
clearly
states
the
name
of
the
appropriate
manufacturer;
thus,
there
was
no
direct
infringement
by
the
manufacturers.
there
was,
however,
direct
infringement
when
those
few
retailers
mislabeled
the
generic
name
as
the
brand
name
and
failed
to
inform
customers.
but
the
petitioners
could
be
vicariously
liable
for
these
isolated
acts
of
druggists
as
contributory
infringers
only
if
they
have
the
knowledge
or
intent
required
by
judge
friendly
and
the
cases
recited
in
our
brief.
and
as
i
previously
indicated,
ives
has
no
evidence
on
that
particular
issue.
it
merely
showed
facilitation
and
relied
on
the
assumption
that
when
presented
with
identical
capsules,
pharmacists
as
a
group
will
be
so
tempted
that
they
will
disregard
their
professional
obligations
and
statutory
responsibilities
simply
in
order
to
make
a
fast
buck.
now,
this
is
a
pessimistic
assumption
that's
similar
to
one
that
the
court
was
asked
to
make
in
virginia
board
of
pharmacy,
and
the
court
properly
refused
to
do
so,
because
in
any
event
this
temptation
to
deceive,
which
is
presented
when
any
product
is
imitated,
whether
it
be
a
singer
sewing
machine,
or
shredded
wheat,
or
cocoa
quinine,
or
hungarian
bitter
water...
whenever
a
product
is
copied,
there
is
some
temptation
presented
to
those
further
down
the
line
in
distribution
to
pass
it
off.
but
this
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
sufficient
nexus
between
the
manufacturer,
who
makes
no
suggestion,
merely
facilitates,
and
the
ultimate
infringement
by
the
retail
person.
in
fact,
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
coca-cola-snow
crest
case...
i
realize
that
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
tends
to
get
a
lot
of
comment,
but
there
is
some
language
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
that
case
which
bears
on
this
very
issue.
and
that
is
that
the
court
said
that
all
that
snow
crest
did
to
make
substitution
possible
was
to
make
their
product
identical,
which
it
had
a
right
to
do.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
government
takes
the
position
that
on
this
record...
the
record
is
rather
sparse
as
to
functionality.
i
think
on
this
record
we'd
have
to
say
that
the
district
court
made
findings
of
fact
which
are
in
fact
not
clearly
erroneous.
as
to
whether
another
finder
of
fact
would
have
found
differently
is
hard
to
say.
the
record
indeed
is
sparse.
we
don't
argue--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--we
argue
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--color
can
have
functionality.
we
submit
that
the
record
here
is
insufficient
to
state
that
in
fact
functionality
has
been
prove,
or
for
that
matter
that
nonfunctionality
has
been
proved.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
the
color
was
functional
and
therefore
could
be
copied.
in
particular,
the
functionality
that
the
district
court
found
was
the
possibility
of
avoiding
patient
anxiety,
identifying
the
capsules
in
cases
of
consumers
who
co-mingled
them
with
other
capsules
they--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
government
says
it
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
we
don't
argue,
however,
that
color
is
always
functional
or
that
it
is
always
nonfunctional.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
okay.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
don't
know.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
don't
know.
that
is
what
the
petitioners
argue.
as
to
the
evidence
on
aspirin,
or
frankly
for
any
other
particular
drug,
we
don't
know.
but
the
question
is
simply,
as
to
functionality,
is
it
a
value
apart
from
an
identification
of
the
source.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
for
example,
if
i
may
take
one
that
appears
before
me,
a
question
of
judicial
robes.
if
there
were
one
company
that
made
judicial
robes
and
made
them
black,
would
the
second
company
that
made
them
have
to
make
them
green?
the
question
is
do
you
identify
the
color
with
the
product
or
do
you
identify
it
with
the
producer;
and
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
my
personal
view?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
would
think
it
was
something
other
than
aspirin.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
frankly
couldn't
base
it
on
anything
other
than
that.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
to
functionality.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
as
to
secondary
meaning.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
respondents
did
not
satisfy
the
tests
that
judge
friendly
set
down,
and
the
panel
on
the
second
appeal
in
effect
read
the
intent
element
out
of
the
test.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
now,
let
me
separate
this
question
of
section
32
and
the
question
of
section
43.
section
32
is
the
only
issue
that
is
presented
to
this
court.
we
submit
that
43
should
be
remanded.
but
32
is
the
one
that
is
rooted
in
the
trademark,
the
name,
and
the
misuse
of
that
name.
are
the
petitioners
contributorily
liable?
section
43
would
be
an
issue
relating
to
the
non-trademark
features,
namely
the
colors.
so
the
discussion
of
functionality,
the
discussion
of
secondary
meaning
is
largely
an
analysis
that
would
come
within
section
43
rather
than
section
32
which
is
the
issue
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
court
of
appeals
did
refer
to
that.
we
submit
two
points
on
that.
one
is
that
in
the
previous
cases
that
has
not
amounted
to
sufficient
conduct
to
constitute
suggestion
or
active
inducement
and
thereby
to
bring
someone
contributorily
liable.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
you
have
to
do
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
you
have
to
do
it.
it
is
protected
speech.
it
is
precisely
the
speech
that
was
at
issue
in
virginia
board
of
pharmacy.
can
you
provide
price
information:
i
will
sell
x
to
you
for
y.
there
is
an
interesting
issue
about
that
and
that
is
an
apparent
factual
mistake
in
judge
mansfield's
opinion.
the
only
price
list
that
listed
both
the
brand
name
and
the
generic
prices
side
by
side
was
one
price
list.
it
was
not
of
a
manufacturer;
it
was
of
a
distributor
who
in
fact
sold
both
the
brand
name
and
the
generic.
now,
i
submit
on
the
cases
that
that
is
not
sufficient
to
constitute
the
inducement
to
make
out
a
case
of
contributory
infringement.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
excuse
me?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
very
little
has
been
said
about
the
advertisements.
they
don't
seem
to
be
relied
on
as
a
basis
for
upholding
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
i
submit
that
in
fact
they
cannot
properly
be
used
as
a
basis
for
that
because
it
is
simply
adding
information
that
gets
ultimately
to
the
druggist
and
allows
him
to
buy
what
he
would
like.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
function
of
the
color
is
something
that
has
to
be
removed
entirely
from
section
32,
because
the
color
was
not
the
trademark
feature
that
was
the
basis
of
the
finding
of
contributory--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--there
was
a
failure
of
proof.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
under
the
standards
that
judge
friendly
set
down
we
submit
that
the
standard
that
judge
mansfield
ultimately
used
as
to
section
32
read
the
intent
element
out
and
was
incorrect
in
that
respect.
there
was
also
the
question
of--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--under
judge...
and
there
were
no
suggestion?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
presumably
not,
because
judge
mansfield
apparently
assumed
the
fact
of
suggestion
from
the
identity
of
the
color.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
excuse
me.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes.
judge
mansfield
assumed
that
by
using
the
identical
colors,
the
manufacturers
were
thereby
suggesting
to
the
retailers
that
they
pass
off.
and
in
our
view
that
is
insufficient
proof,
and
that
is
an
inappropriate
standard
for
judging
liability
under
section
32.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
43a.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
that
was
the
chief
issue
of
trial.
that
was
the
chief
issue
on
the
appeal.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
believe
that
that
is
really
what
is
at
issue
here,
and
clearly
there
should
be
a
remand
for
a
finding
under
section
43a.
it's
not
been
briefed
in
this
court
by
the
parties.
there
is
a
complete
record
in
the
court
of
appeals,
however.
our
suggestion
was
that
it
would
be
most
suitable
in
the
circumstances
for
a
remand
on
that
issue
and
for
a
reversal
of
section
32.
thank
you.
