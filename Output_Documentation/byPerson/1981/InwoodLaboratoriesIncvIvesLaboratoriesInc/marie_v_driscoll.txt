ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i,
too,
should
begin
with
informing
the
court
just
why
we
are
here
today
and
why
the
finding
of
contributory
trademark
infringement
was
in
fact
clearly
supportable
on
the
record.
i
have
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
court,
and
you
may
wish
to
look
at
what
actually
is
involved
in
this
case.
we
have
vivid
blue
capsules
made
by
ives.
the
defendants...
and
this
an
exhibit
in
the
record...
had
tens
of
thousands
of
color
combinations
from
which
to
select,
and
they
selected
exactly
the
same
colors
when
they
decided
to
sell
generic
cyclandelate.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
same
active
ingredient,
your
honor.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
there
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
we
did
not
raise
an
issue,
as
to
what
in
addition
to
the
active
ingredient
they
may
have
in
their
product.
that
has
been
involved
in
some
other
cases
as
to
whether
the
binders
and
excipients
are
the
same.
but
we
have
not
claimed
in
this
case
that
for
purposes
of,
for
example,
the
substitution
law
in
new
york
which
is
involved,
that
these
products
are
not
in
fact
equivalent.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
capsules
are
exactly
the
same
size,
and
the
defendants'
capsules,
to
make
things
even
worse,
are
completely,
or
were
at
the
beginning
of
this
suit,
completely
anonymous.
their
own
executives
at
depositions
looked
at
their
capsules,
and
they
couldn't
tell
where
there
product
came
from.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes.
your
honor.
i
believe
they're
lodged
with
the
clerk.
i
had
ten
facsimiles
made.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
they
have...
well,
you
will
see,
your
honor,
also
that
i
have
included
in
the
upper
righthand
samples
of
their
capsules
which
have
markings
on
it,
the
names
or
mdc
number;
and
in
each
case...
and
there
have
been
many
cases
brought
recently
involving
the
duplication
of
color
of
prescription
drug
capsules...
it's
been
held
that
the
imprint
is
so
small...
and
i
think
the
court
will
agree...
it
is
so
small--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--yes,
i
would.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that
it
is
not...
i'm
not
saying
it's
significant.
i'm
saying
it's
so
small--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--it's
so...
yes.
and
also
in
this
exhibit
you
will
see
at
the
lower
right
the
capsules
of
w.h.
hauck
company.
that
is
the
company
to
which
reference
was
made
in
mr.
bass'
argument.
that
company
sells
generic
cyclandelate,
but
it
is
not
a
copycat.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
no.
there
has
been
extensive
evidence
on
this,
your
honor.
physicians
testified.
we
have
physicians
totaling,
if
you
count
up
the
plaintiffs'
and
the
defendants'
physicians,
with
125
years
of
experience
total
in
treating
patients
where
they
have
had
color
change.
color
change
comes
about
fairly
frequently
in
this
industry
because
there
are
many
companies
that
sell
generics
that
do
not
duplicate
the
appearance
of
the
pioneer
or
market
leader.
and
while
the
patients
may
inquire
and
may
say
i
notice
why
is
this
green
this
month,
it's
always
been
red,
hasn't
it,
the
testimony
is
when
the
pharmacist
or
the
physician
explains
you're
getting
a
generic
because
it's
the
same
product,
we
believe
it's
cheaper,
patients
accept
that.
there
was
one
patient
who
refused
to
accept
a
change...
we
do
not
know
whether
it
was
because
of
color
or
because
he
simply
didn't
want
a
generic...
from
one
of
the
doctors
that
the
defendants
produced.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
significant
evidence
that
color
changes
all
the
time,
for
example,
in
institutional
settings.
hospitals
and
government
institutions
for
years
have
bought
generics,
and
they
buy
on
the
basis
of
the
best
price,
also
quality,
and
their
colors
change
frequently.
patients
in
the
hospitals
are
used
to
this,
and
these
would
be
the
same
patients
who
at
home
may
be
getting
a
different
color.
when
they
go
to
the
hospital
they
get
a
different
color
generic.
the
testimony
was
there
really
is
no
problem.
the
government
does
not
require
that
color
be
part
of
the
bidding
process,
for
example.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
true.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
you
can
make
a
phone
call,
that's
correct,
which
does
happen.
that's
right.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
well,
there
are
more
people
to
explain
it.
once
the
explanation
is
made
i'm
not
sure
it's
more
readily
accepted
one
place
or
another.
there
seem
to
be
a
distinction
on
that
doesn't.
and
i
might
add
that
the
particular
product
involved
in
this
case
is
a
long-term
medication
for
poor
circulation.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
right.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
court
of
appeals
application
of
the
law,
yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
while
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
use
the
words
"clearly
erroneous",
it
would
be
a
matter
of
semantics
to
say
that
it
was
not
applying
such
a
standard,
because
the
court
of--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--and
that
it
did,
yes,
because
it
said,
for
example,
on
the
question
of
the
mislabeling
that
occurred,
there
was
no
support--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
nor
do
i
believe
it
did.
the
language
is
very
strong,
and
i'll
quote.
there's
no
support
in
the
record
for
the
defendants'
claim
that
the
mislabeling
that
occurred
was
because
of
confusion.
there's
no
persuasive
evidence
on
this
point.
arguments
that
the
defendants
made
and
testimony
on
another
point
are
unconvincing.
there's
no
evidence
of
patient
confusion.
there's
no
evidence
that
doctors
or
druggists
refused
to
explain--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--it's
hard
to
tell
what
standard
of
law
the
district
court
applied
because--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--it
appeared
on
both
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
and
after
trial
to
require
not
only
intent
but
almost
active
participation.
the
language
is
not
that
clear.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
district
court,
yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
use
the
word
32
has
been
violated
and
whether
there's
been
a
trademark
infringement,
specific
intent
to
infringe
is
never
an
element
of
tradement
infringement.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that
would
be
incorrect.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes,
unless
you
can
interpret
the--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--well,
as
i
say,
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
whether
the
court
in
fact
was
reversing
on
a
clearly
erroneous
basis
or
whether
it
was
applying
the
law
differently.
it
had
the
complete
record
in
front
of
it.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
no.
it
is
possible
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
defendants
were
liable
for
the
clear
acts
of
trademark
infringement
by
the
pharmacists
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
also
applying
an
intent
standard,
the
intent
being
the
intentional
copying
of
the
color,
the
intentional
hiding
of
the
source
of
the
product,
the
intentional
distribution
of
pamphlets
in
which
the
defendants
indicated
to
whoever
purchased
their
product,
look,
this
is
the
same
color.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
result
was
wrong.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
district
court
standard
went
beyond
intent
because
it
implied
there
had
to
be
almost
an
actual
participation.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
right.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
corrected
the
result,
yes.
whether
it--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--well,
all
i
can
suggest
is
the
court
was
applying
the
standard
in
united
states
against
gypsum
which
indicated
that
a
finding
can
be
reversed
when
the
reviewing
court
on
the
entire
evidence,
and
this
court
has
said,
is
left
with
the
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
made.
and
this
standard
has
been
repeated
in
u.s.
against
singer.
there
were
many
undisputed
facts
in
this
case.
there
were
many
elements
of
proof
in
this
case
that
the
defendants
never
produced
at
all.
so
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
even
a
finding.
there
was
nothing
put
in.
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
patients.
no
patients
appeared.
no
survey
was
put
in
by
the
defendants
indicating
patient
concern
about
color
change.
and
the
applicable
standards
as
applied
to
the
facts
were
considered
incorrect
by
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
it
had
to
specifically
refer
to
rule
52
or
specifically
use
the
words
"clearly
erroneous".
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
if
the
record
is
reviewed,
and
i'll
take
first
the
function
record,
the
record
on
whether
this
is
functional
or
not,
we
have
a
situation
where
it's
undisputed
that
the
drug
in
question
is
a
white
powder.
color
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
if
we
go
back
to
the
normal
standards
of
what
function
means.
initially,
ives
could
have
made
this
drug
in
any
color.
it,
for
a
purely
arbitrary
reason,
chose
the
blue
and
the
blue-red.
so
there
is
no
inherent
functionality,
and
that
is
undisputed,
and
i
believe
even
the
district
court
admitted
that
there's
no
inherent
functionality.
judge
friendly
on
the
first
appeal
agreed
that
this
was
arbitrary,
had
no
relationship
to
the
underlying
drug,
and
indicated
that
whether
or
not
the
colors
had
become
functional,
had
somehow
acquired
functionality,
would
depend
on
proof
offered
by
the
defendants.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
proof
offered
by
the
defendants,
you
find
that
there
are
three
physicians
who
testified
before
the
defendants;
and
i'm
assuming
now
that
although
there
was
no
finding
as
to
credibility,
we'll
eliminate
completely
all
the
plaintiffs'
evidence
on
this,
but
let's
just
look
at
what
the
defendant
put
in
on
functionality
through
its
physicians.
they
all
agreed
that
there
are
many
non-look
alike
generics
on
the
marketplace,
and
that
they
had
had
experience
with
them;
that
if
their
patients
inquire
why
is
there
a
color
change,
the
patient
accepts
the
explanation
for
the
color
change.
one
physician
who
sees
approximately
a
thousand
patients
a
year
and
has
practiced
for
16
years...
that's
the
defendant's
dr.
bloom...
said
that
once,
once
in
his
entire
practice
a
patient
did
not
accept
his
explanation
and
asked
to
go
back
to
the
original
drug.
a
second
doctor,
dr.
schinback,
couldn't
recall
of
a
single
instance
in
his
practice
where
the
explanation
wasn't
accepted.
in
other
words,
if
you
say
it's
a
different
color
because
i'm
giving
you
a
generic,
i
want
you
to
get
a
less
expensive
drug,
patients
accept
that.
the
third
doctor,
who
hadn't
practiced
for
several
years
and
is
now
with
the
new
york
health
and
hospital
corporations,
testified
that
several
years
ago
some
of
her
patients
who
had
parkinson's
disease
did
not
want
to
change
the
source
of
their
medication;
and
it
was
not
clear
that
color
had
anything
to
do
with
that,
but
whether
they
might
have
been
concerned
about
the
true
source
of
the
medication.
and
at
the
health
and
hospitals
corporation
where
that
witness
of
the
defendant
was
then
employed,
it
was
clear
that
all
purchasing
decisions
as
to
whether
generics
are
to
be
accepted
are
made
not
on
the
basis
of
color
but
price.
color
simply
is
really
not
a
determining
factor
in
whether
institutional
sales
can
be
made.
the
fda,
which
has
primary
jurisdiction
over
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
drug
products,
has
specifically
said
in
response
to
pressures
by
the
generic
drug
industry
to
have
a
color
requirement
that
they
do
not
believe
that
safety
and
efficacy
require
that
the
drug
color
be
the
same.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes.
there
are
several
types,
your
honor.
we
had
collected
and
put
in
evidence
at
trial
approximately
34
instances.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--where
a
bottle
containing
a
generic
look-alike
had
the
ives
trademark
on
the
label
put
on
there
by
the
pharmacist.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
i
object
to
the
uses
in
this
case.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes,
but
they'd
be
less
likely...
they'd
be
more
likely
to--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
very
first
time
someone
gets
a
drug
is
simply
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
there
would
be
no
recognition
by
the
patient,
no
understanding
by
the
patient
that
he
should--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--however,
it
could
make
a
difference
if
the
pharmacist--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--no.
most...
many
of
these,
your
honor,
would
have
been
situations
where
we
sent
a
shopper
out.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes,
but
the
pharmacist
wouldn't
know
that
it
was
the
first
prescription.
they
could
have
had
a
prescription
from
another
doctor.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
a
different
pharmacy
from
the
one
before
and
a
different
community.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
dated?
yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
no.
the
likelihood
of
abuse
i
believe
is
worse
in
the
case
of
maintenance
drugs
because
of
the
recognition.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
true,
but
he
may
not...
he
certainly
would
be...
he
would
be
unlikely
to
detect
a
problem,
but
so
would
my
person
be
unlikely
to
detect
a
problem
if
it's
in
the
same
exact
color.
a
patient...
and
this
goes--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--that's
true.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
true.
and
the
problem
is--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--color
is
critical
because
it
makes
it...
and
it's
been
admitted
in
this
case
and
stipulated
that
it
makes
it
more
likely
for
the
pharmacist
to
do
this
because
he
doesn't
think
he's
going
to
be
detected,
whether
by,
for
example--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--no,
we
don't.
we
just
know
that
they
dispensed--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--dispensed
a
look-alike
drug
and
called
it
cyclospasmol.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
well,
i
believe
we
do
have
a
guilty
state
of
mind,
and
we
look
back
again
to
judge
wyzanski's
decision,
which
has
been
cited
so
frequently,
and
that
judge
friendly
characterized
on
the
first
appeal
as
providing
the
proper
criteria.
and
that
is,
is
the
person
furnishing
this
look-alike,
does
he
know
he's
dealing
with
customers
who
are
peculiarly
likely
to
use
the
product
wrongfully?
and
we
have
a
very
unfortunate
history,
both
in
cases,
in
ftc
reports,
and
really
in
knowledge
generally
available
to
the
drug
industry,
that
pharmacists
have
an
unfortunate
history...
not
all
of
them,
but
enough
of
them
to
be
a
serious
problem...
of
in
fact
dispensing
cheaper
products
in
filling
prescriptions
for
another
product
and
pocketing
the
monetary
difference.
and
on
this
point
of--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--either
that,
your
honor,
yes,
and
that
does
happen,
or
charging
more
for
the
generic
than
they
might
otherwise
do
because
the
patient
is
not
going
to
know
when
he
sees
something
that
looks
just
like
the
ives
capsule
that
he
should
be
getting
a
price
break.
and
you'll
see
in
the
attorney
general...
state
of
new
york
attorney
general
report,
which
is
in
evidence
in
this
case,
that
very
often
in
new
york
pharmacists
are
in
fact
filling
generic
prescriptions
and
charging
more
than
other
pharmacies
charge
for
the
brand
name.
the
pricing
patterns
are
erratic,
but
certainly
there
is
no
pass-along
of
the
full
generic
saving
or
even
much
of
the
generic
saving
to
patients
who
are
getting
prescriptions
filled
in
that
state
and
i
believe
in
others,
but
certainly
not
in
new
york.
and
a
change
in
color
in
this
instance,
if
it
would
alert
the
patient
to
inquire
of
the
pharmacist
why
is
the
capsule
green
this
time
instead
of
blue,
the
patient
would
also
be
able
to
detect
the
economic
problem
and
ask
the
pharmacist
why
am
i
paying
the
same
amount
as
i
always
paid
for
the
name
brand.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
as
to
the
straight
mislabeling--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--okay.
of
the
mislabeling
as
opposed
to
the
illegal
substitution,
our
survey,
which
was
projectable
to
pharmacies
in
new
york
state,
indicated
there
was
a
29
percent
of
the
pharmacists
put
our
trademark
on
their
look-alike.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
i
believe
i
was
in
the
middle
of
an
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
stevens
about
the
frequency
of
the
infringements,
and
we
have
to
look
at
those
infringements
in
a
few
ways.
when
we're
talking
about
the
legal
substitution
but
followed
by
mislabeling
or
passing
off,
our
survey
showed
that
this
occurred
29
percent
of
the
time
in
the
pharmacies
in
new
york
where
the
shopping
was
done.
in
this
particular
case,
while
we
have
many
instances
of
illegal
substitution
and
mislabeling,
that
is
not
projectable.
there
was
not
a
projectable
survey
done
on
that.
so
i
cannot
say
what
the
percentage
is,
but
it's
clear
from
the
history
of
the
pharmaceutical
industry,
from
the
ftc
report
that
is
referred
to
many
times
in
the
briefs,
and
from
other
look-alike
cases,
of
which
there
have
been
many
recently,
that
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
illegal
substitution
and
therefore
infringement
involved.
in
the
ftc
report
i
believe
it
was
said
to
be
as
high
as
25
percent
of
the
time.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
no.
i
would
have
to
take
the
position
that
if
there
were
a
clear
and
unequivocal
statement
like
that,
there
would
not
be
an
infringement
because
there
would
not
be
a
chance
of
misunderstanding.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
well,
that
would
put
us
once
again
at
the
mercy
of
the
pharmacists.
in
the
particular
shoppings
we
did
the
only
reason
the
pharmacist
disclosed
anything
to
the
shoppers
that
went
in
was
that
our
shoppers
were
instructed
as
part
of
the
survey
instructions
to
ask
whether
or
not
a
generic
had
been
dispensed.
but
because
of
the
peculiar
way
in
which
prescription
drugs
reach
the
public
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
pharmacists
are
passing
off
these
look-alikes,
we
do
not
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
we
are
relying
on
the
good
faith
of
the
pharmacists,
because
we
see
this
problem
already.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
well,
the
person
receiving
the
bottle
presumably
would
not
be
confused,
and
to
that
extent
there
would
be
no
infringement;
but
anyone
else
who
saw
the
bottle,
for
example,
such
as
the
physician
should
something
have
gone
wrong
with
the
product
and
the
patient
said
this
doesn't
seem
to
be
working
the
same
way,
here's
my
bottle,
to
that
extent
anyone
else
who
saw
labeling
like
that
would
in
fact--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--not
necessarily.
he
may.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
some
of
these
designations,
"gen"
may
mean
something.
a
eq>
["]
may
not.
there
are
all
sorts
of
gradations.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
no.
see,
the
physician
is
in
an
unusual
circumstance
in
most
states,
your
honor.
in
most
states
substitution
is
not
mandatory
so
that
when
a
physician,
for
example,
writes
a
prescription
and
indicates
that
a
generic
can
be
dispensed,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
pharmacist
must
dispense
a
generic.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
no,
he's
not,
because
he
is
not
providing
the
druggist
with
the
means
by
which
the
patient
is
fooled.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
yes,
he
could
have,
but
he
has
no
control
over
what's
finally
given
to
the
patient
or
what
the
labels
given
to
the
patient
say.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
except
in
a
mandatory--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--no,
but
he
has
no
control
over...
let's
talk
about
these
look-alikes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
if
his
instructions
are
followed,
and
he,
of
course,
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
his
instructions
are
followed
because
he
is
unlikely
ever
to
see,
unless
there
is
a
problem,
what
has
been
dispensed.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
right,
because
there
is
no
independent
reason
for
that
manufacturer
to
make
these
products
in
the
look-alike
form.
they
could
just
as
easily
make
those
products
in
the
colors
that,
for
example,
hauck
uses
where
the
opportunity
for
wrongdoing
or
the
likelihood
of
wrongdoing
would
be
far
less,
whereas
the
physician
has
presumably
independent
and
good
reasons
for
prescribing
either
the
branded
product
or
the
generic.
these
people
have
furnished,
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated,
no
good
reason
whatsoever
for
copying
the
appearance.
many
other
manufacturers
are
on
the
market
with
non-look
alikes,
and
with
non-look
alikes
you
give
the
patient
an
opportunity
to
know
that
something
has
been
changed.
the
change
isn't
concealed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--no,
but
you
do
have
an
obligation
not
to
be
the
person
who
facilitates,
makes
more
likely,
or
allows
these
pharmacists
in
many
more
instances
to--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--but
he
hasn't
furnished
the
look-alike
that
prevents
the
patient
from
finding
out.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
see
that
the
analogy
flows,
because
the
doctor
is
not
providing--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
right.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
that's
right.
and
if
it
is
in
fact
a
different
color,
the
patient
will
do
exactly
what--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--well,
in
this...
in
this
case
because
it
is
a
maintenance
drug,
the
patient
is
very
likely--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--well,
it
is
more
likely
that
a
patient
will
be
alerted
to
the
fact
that
he
should
inquire
about
a
color
change
if
it
is
a
maintenance
drug,
yes.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
well,
to
that
extent
those
patients
have
less
of
a
way
to
protect
themselves.
however,
the
pharmacist--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--but
the
pharmacist
doesn't
necessarily
know
this.
and
if
a
pharmacist
has
a
look-alike,
the
pharmacist
admittedly
in
this
case
is
more
likely
to
take
the
chance
of
passing
off
and
take
the
chance
of
illegal
substitution
because
it
is
so
much
less
likely
that
he
will...
that
his
subterfuge
will
be
detected.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
the
attorney
general's
report
in
the
state
of
new
york
indicated
that
violation
of
the
new
york
substitution
law,
for
example,
is
given
a
very
low
priority.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
specific
intent
to
deceive
by
the
manufacturers,
it
does
not
turn
on
the
specific
intent
to
deceive.
what
it
does
turn
on
is
the
manufacturer's
knowledge
that
in
the
prescription
drug
industry
there
is
a
very
special
circumstance,
namely
there
is
an
individual
intermediary,
the
pharmacist,
who
unfortunately
as
widely
known
in
the
industry
and
all
the
cases,
has
a
proclivity
toward
trying
to
get
away
with
something
to
make
himself
more
money,
either
through
illegally
substituting
or
just
through...
even
through
in
this
case
legally
substituting
but
misbranding
and
charging
more
money.
in
the
circumstances,
given
the
fact
that
these
were
identically
copied...
they
didn't
have
to
be;
they
could
have
done
what
hauck
did...
given
the
fact
that
they
all
admit
that
the
identical
copying
of
the
color
in
fact
made
illegal
substitution
and
misbranding
more
likely
to
occur
and
far
less
likely
to
detect,
and
given
the
fact
they
knew
they
were
dealing
with
a
very
particular
industry...
and
i
also
suggest
that
it
would
not
be
offensive
to
hold
these
prescription
drug
manufacturers
to
a
very
high
standard
to
make
sure
there
isn't
deception.
public
policy
certainly
is
to
hold
prescription
drug
manufacturers
to
very
high
standards.
they're
the
only
industry
i
can
think
of
who
can't
even
sell
their
products
without
prior
approval.
these
people--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--well,
these
drugs
are
taken
principally
by
elderly
people,
and
there
is
no
evidence
that--
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
--yes.
and
the
pharmacists
can
also
read
the
original
manufacturers'
bottles
and
know
what
they're
dispensing.
it's
not
that
the
pharmacists
are
making
mistakes,
but
the
pharmacist,
even
when
there
is
an
imprint
on
this
capsule,
knows
that
people
don't
pay
that
much
attention
to
the
imprint.
these
are
very
small
imprints
because
of
the
nature
of
the
product.
obviously
it's
a
small
capsule.
ms.
marie
v.
driscoll
it's
almost...
it's
very
difficult
to
do
much
more
than
what
is
done
and
still
have
it
visible.
and
there's
no
evidence
that
the
public
would
derive...
would
really
look
at
this.
they
look
at
the
colors.
we
did
a
survey
of
patients
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
in
which
we
showed
the
patients
a...
containers,
three
containers,
one
of
which
had...
two
of
which
had
completely
anonymous
capsules
which
the
district
court
opinion
in
this
case
would
sanction,
and
the
third
of
which
had
capsules
clearly
imprinted
with
the
name
premo.
and
when
asked
what
those
capsules
were,
even
the
imprinted
ones,
patients
still
thought
they
were
the
ives
cyclospasmol.
the
imprint
does
not,
and
has
been
held
in
all
these
cases
not
to
have
an
effect.
even
the
district
court
in
this
case
said
that
because
of
the
size
of
the
product
we're
dealing
with
and
the
fact
that
we
do
have
elderly
patients
who
might
not
see
as
well
that
the
imprint
simply
does
not
make
an
effect.
