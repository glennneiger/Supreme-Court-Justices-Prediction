unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
statute
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
lanham
act?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
mr.
bass,
aren't
we
really
concerned
with
whether
there
is
a
section
32
of
the
lanham
act
violation?
unknown
speaker
we're
not
concerned
properly,
are
we,
with
the
43a
question,
would
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
shouldn't
we
focus
on
what
standard
of
review
the
court
of
appeals
invoked
in
reviewing
the
district
court
findings?
unknown
speaker
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
maybe
a
lot
of
time
was
spent
in
the
briefs
arguing
something
that
we
wouldn't
end
up
resolving
if
we
stuck
to
the
question
that
we
were
supposed
to
resolve.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
bass,
may
i
interrupt
a
minute?
unknown
speaker
the
concept
of
legal
substitution
means
legal
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
fact
that
it's
legal
as
a
matter
of
state
law
doesn't
necessarily
mean
there
was
no
infringement
or
unfair
competition,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
i'm
suggesting
is
i
don't
think
your
argument
turns
on
whether...
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
legal
substitution
isn't
what's
critical.
the
fact
is
that
there
was
no
wrongful
intent
or
not
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
likelihood
of
deception
or
something
of
that
character.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
that
could
exist
even
though
the
substitution
was
lawful.
it
just
seemed
to
me
you're
emphasizing
a
point
that
is
not
critical
to
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bass.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
are
the
four
drug
manufacturers
that
are
here
in
this
case
the
only
ones
who
marked
this
particular
drug?
unknown
speaker
how
many
others
are
there?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
asking
only
about
drug
manufacturing
companies
that
manufacture
this
particular
drug.
unknown
speaker
there
are
four
before
us
in
this
case.
are
there
others
in
the
united
states
that
market...
manufacture
and
market
this
drug?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
only
two
parties
before
the
court
that
are
presently
manufacturing
this
drug?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
the
company
in
georgia
that
you
mentioned
markets
the
drug
with
the
same
color
and
shape
distinctions
that
you
are
discussing?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
others
who
use
different
colors?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
purpose
of
using
identical
colors?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
the
purpose
is
to
cause
the
public
to
think
that
they're
produced
by
the
same
manufacturer?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but
from
your
point
of
view
it
aids
confusion.
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have
copied
theirs.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bass--
unknown
speaker
--maybe
the
patients
aren't
confused,
but
i
am.
unknown
speaker
you
say
if
they
put
a
star
on
it
it's
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
put
color
on
it
it's
wrong.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
somebody
go
in
the
drugstore
and
say
i
want
some
red
pills?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
to
the
color-blind
patient?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
mr.
bass,
those
laws
don't
say
anything
about
color.
which
is
the
other
state?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
bass,
about
your
star
example?
unknown
speaker
you
said
well,
they
could
use
a
star,
but
unless
they
got
a
trademark
on
it,
that
wouldn't
be
a
different
case,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
if
they
do
not
trademark
the
star,
couldn't
you
copy
the
star
as
well
as
the
color?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
deny
that
color
can
give
rise
to
a
secondary
meaning?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference
between
color
and
a
star
then?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
government's
interest
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
lanham
act
is
the
federal
policy
favoring
competition
by
differentiation?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
does
the
government
take
a
position
on
the
question
of
functionality
of
color?
unknown
speaker
and
the
government
takes
no
broader
position
than
that?
unknown
speaker
on
the
color
question.
unknown
speaker
and
what
were
the
findings
of
the
district
court
on
functionality
here?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
the
government
either
supports
that
finding
or
says
in
any
event
it
was
not
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you...
let
me
try
this
out
on
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
someone
came
out
with
a
new
aspirin,
which
could
readily
be
done,
i
assume,
and
they
had
the
same
shape
and
size
but
it's
tinted
pale
green.
are
you
suggesting
that
that
would...
that
people
are
so
accustomed
to
aspirin
and
bufferin
and
the
related
things--
unknown
speaker
--being
white
that
the
green
would--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
common
human
experience
what
would
be,
in
your
view,
the
reaction
to
people
being
handed
green
aspirin?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
common
human
experience
which
you
share.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
what
judge
friendly
said
in
the
original
opinion.
he
gave
certain
tests,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
they
were
not
followed.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
also
on
the
distribution
of
the
comparative
prices?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
fact,
how
are
you
going
to
get
competition
if
you
don't--
unknown
speaker
--comparing
prices.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
controversy
about
that
here?
unknown
speaker
at
this
point?
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument
on
functionality
or
nonfunctionality.
your
submission
is
that
even
if
color
has
no
function
to
play,
there
still
is
not
sufficient
evidence
of
intent
to
cause
the
retailer
to
infringe.
unknown
speaker
really,
the
government's
position
just
boils
down
to
a
suggestion
that
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
of--
unknown
speaker
--there's
no
really
big
issue
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
under
judge
mansfield's
standard
suppose
they
used
a
different
color,
but
they
had
everything
else
the
same.
do
you
think
there
would
be
contributory
infringement?
unknown
speaker
just
the...
everything's
the
same
except
they
have
different
colored
products.
under
judge
mansfield's
standard
would
the
generic
druggist...
generic
manufacturer
be
guilty
of
contributory
infringement?
unknown
speaker
suggestion
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
suggestion
to
the
retailer?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
brief
to
say
that
the
case
should
have
been
decided
under
section
43b
rather
than
32.
unknown
speaker
43a.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
suggestion
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
be
decided
on
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
for
the
same
content?
unknown
speaker
the
same...
well,
active
ingredient.
the
same
total
content?
unknown
speaker
the
capsule
is
the
same
size?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say,
ms.
driscoll,
copies
of
that
are
around
here?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
corrected,
though,
wasn't
it?
i
mean
your
case
doesn't
depend
on
that.
they
could
have
their
own
name
on
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
isn't
it
your
legal
position
that
even
if
the
imprint
were
large,
you
would
still
make
the
same
claim
about
their
using
the
color?
unknown
speaker
so
now
why
are
you
arguing
that
it's
significant
that
it's
not
legible.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
a
matter
of
interest.
unknown
speaker
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
practical
question.
suppose
you
have
a
patient
with
diabetes,
for
example,
or
something
of
that
kind
where
they
lifelong
or
for
a
long
period
of
time
take
a
particular
prescribed
medicine.
and
at
some
point
either
the
pharmacist
acting
on
his
own
under
this
dual
prescription
of
the
new
york
law
or
the
physician
himself
in
order
to
save
the
patient
money
says
give
them
the
generic
drug;
it's
the
same
thing.
now,
if
it
comes
in
a
different
color,
do
you
say
that
creates
no
problem,
psychological
or
whatever,
for
the
patient?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
agree
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
patient
in
the
hospital
and
the
patient
taking
a
medication
long-term
at
home
without
constant
medical
guidance;
that
is,
there's
a
nurse
or
an
intern
or
a
doctor
or
a
resident
in
the
hospital
to
explain
the
change.
unknown
speaker
at
home
the
patient
is--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
difference,
that
it's
more
readily
explained
to
the
patient
in
the
hospital
than
it
is
to
the
other
patient?
unknown
speaker
ms.
driscoll,
you're
arguing
the
facts,
which
i
think
you're
really
entitled
to
do,
but
you
started
out
by
saying
you
thought
there
was...
or
early
in
your
argument
you
said
you
thought
there
was
support
in
the
record
for
the
finding
that
there
was
a
section
32
violation.
unknown
speaker
whose
finding
were
you
talking
about,
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
had
found
no
section
32
violation
and
had
a
series
of
factual
findings.
did
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
any
of
the
district
court's
findings?
unknown
speaker
and
did
it
do
so
on
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
agree
that
it
should
have,
and
that
it
did
furthermore.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
free
to
arrive
at
its
own
independent
finding?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals...
or
i'll
just
ask
you
directly.
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
different
standard
of
law
with
respect
to
a
section
32
violation
than
did
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well
did
it
require
an
intent,
or
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
say
the
district
court
had
an
intent
requirement
in
its
appraisal
of
the
facts--
unknown
speaker
--you...
that
would
be
incorrect,
and
you
suggest
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
adopt
a...
did
adopt
a
different
standard
than
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
if
that's
so,
if
there
was
an
error
of
law
in
the
district
court,
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
the
proper
proceeding,
proper
procedure
to
remand
for
a
new
trial
under
the
right
standard
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals
arriving
at
its
own
independent
view
of
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just...
i
thought
you
just
conceded
or
just
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
standard
was
different
from
that
adopted
by
the
district
court,
legal
standard.
the
district
court
had
an
intent
standard.
you
say
that
was
wrong,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
the
standard
the
district
court
applied
was
wrong.
you
just
said
so
a
moment
ago.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
the
standard
was
wrong.
you
said
they
applied
an
intent
standard
that
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
however...
whatever
standard
it
was,
you
say
it
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
corrected
it.
unknown
speaker
corrected
the
standard.
can
you
suggest
any
reason
why
there
is
no
reference
to
rule
52
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
this
whole
subject,
could
i
focus
your
attention
specifically
to
the
district
court's
finding
that
color
is
functional
and
that
it
has
no
secondary
meaning
in
these
circumstances.
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
district
court
clearly
erred
in
making
that
finding?
unknown
speaker
ms.
driscoll,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
examples
of
infringement
on
page
10
of
your
brief?
as
i
understand
it,
the
thing
you
objected
to
primarily
was
that
the
retail
druggist
would
use
the
name
cyclospasmol
and
then
put
something
additional
that
was
a
little
bit
ambiguous,
like
they
might
put
the
word
"generic"
or
"gen"
or
something
like
that,
and
those
are
examples
of
the
infringement
of
which
you
primarily
complain.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
the
word
"cyclospasmol".
i
take
it
you
object
to
any
use
of
the
word
"cyclospasmol"
by
the
druggist?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
any
event,
could
not
the
generic
manufacturer
and
the
druggist
continue
to
do
exactly
what
they've
done
here
even
with
different
colored
capsules?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
question
of
probabilities.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
of
course,
your
case
is
one
where
the
patient
used
the
same
drug
over
and
over
again.
but
with
the
first
subscription
why
would
the
patient
have
any
knowledge
about
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
color
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
that
situation.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
these
were
all
refills?
unknown
speaker
as
though
he
were
getting
his
first
prescription
filled.
unknown
speaker
and
he
would
have
been
equally
misled
if
the
color
were
not
the
same.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
pharmacist
can
usually
tell
by
the
date
whether
it's
a
refill
or
not,
can't
he?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
the
doctor's
prescription
is
usually
dated,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
your
argument
draw
any
distinction
between
the
kind
of
drug
you
have
where
it's
largely
refills
and
the
same
situation
in
which
it
was
kind
of
just
one
prescription
drugs?
unknown
speaker
i
should
think
that
it
would
be
the
other
way
around,
that
the
one
who
only
gets
the
drug
once
wouldn't
know
what
it
looked
like
or
anything
right
then.
he'd
have
no
way
of
protecting
himself
against
a
complicated
name
followed
by
"gen"
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
to
you
is
the
problem,
as
long
as
you're
selling
the
same
drug
and
advertising
it
as
performing
the
same
function
biotically
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
the
problem's
always
going
to
be
there,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
that
there's
a
risk
that
the
druggist
who
is
unscrupulous
will
say
look,
i
can
give
you
something
cheap...
well,
may
not
even
say
that...
that
will
sell
it
more
cheaply
but
just
put
that
kind
of
ambiguous
legend
on
that
a
lot
of
people
really
don't
understand
very
well
anyway.
unknown
speaker
so
i'm
just
wondering
if
color
really
is
the
critical
problem,
or
is
it
selling
generic
drugs?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
that
any
of
these
pharmacists
had
that
particular
decisionmaking
process?
unknown
speaker
it
just
seemed
reasonable
to
the
judge--
unknown
speaker
--may
we
return
just
a
moment
to
the
standard?
the
solicitor
general
suggested,
as
i
recall,
that
a
guilty
state
of
mind...
excuse
me...
was
necessary,
was
a
necessary
element
to
prove
a
case
under
section
32.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
by
that
charging
for
the
brand
name
but
actually
delivering
the
generic
drug?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
what
percentage
of
retail
druggists
engage
in
this
kind
of
practice?
unknown
speaker
just
say
infringement,
the
whole
category
of
infringement.
unknown
speaker
i
meant
to
ask
you
also,
if
i
could,
is
it
your
view
that
any
time
the
word
"cyclospasmol"
is
used
on
the
label
there's
an
infringement?
supposing,
for
example,
a
druggist
said
this
product
is
a
generic
equivalent
to
cyclospasmol;
he
spelled
it
all
out.
would
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
supposing
in
each
of
these
cases
where
you
just
have
the
"gen",
say
the
druggist
had
explained;
he
said
you
understand,
don't
you,
the
doctor
said
we
can
substitute,
and
that's
what
we've
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
not
clear
what
your
answer
to
my
question
was.
supposing
that
the
pharmacist
says
this
is
a
generic
equivalent
to
cyclospasmol,
and
he
just
has
the
writing,
you
say.
would
that
be
infringement
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
doctor
wouldn't
be
confused.
he
would
know
what
the
"gen"
meant,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
doctor
doesn't
understand--
unknown
speaker
--but
if...
if
a
doctor...
if
a
doctor
participates
in
this
process
of
permitting
a
druggist
to
substitute,
is
he...
can
he
be
liable,
too,
under
the...
under
32
or
under...
i
guess
he
couldn't
be
under...
couldn't
be
under...
but
he
could...
how
about
32?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
isn't
he
like
the
manufacturer
putting
the
druggist
in
a
position
to
pass
off?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's...
he
could
have
prescribed
a
trade
name
product,
though,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
has
more
control--
unknown
speaker
--he
has
more
control
than
the
manufacturer.
i
would
think
so.
without
the
prescription
the
druggist
can't
even
do
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
the
druggist
follows
his
instructions,
the
doctor
has
quite
a
bit
of
control.
unknown
speaker
well,
neither
does
the
manufacturer,
but
the
manufacturer
gets...
is
being
held
liable
on
the
grounds
that
he
impliedly...
that
he
facilitates
the
passing
off.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
imposes
a
duty
on
them
to
have
a
reason.
i
mean
there's
no
sort
of
general
law
that
you've
got
to
have
a
reason
for
making
something
blue
instead
of
red.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that's
the
test
of
secondary
infringement,
the
doctor
is
clearly
guilty,
if
he
just
makes
it
more
likely
or
makes
it
possible.
unknown
speaker
he's
given
the
authorization
to
purchase
it.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
his
authorization
would
apply
even
if
the
thing
is
a
different
color.
unknown
speaker
he
would
make
it
possible
for...
in
any
generic
drug
to
make
it
possible
for
the
unscrupulous
druggist
to
substitute.
unknown
speaker
and
write
the
word,
whatever
the
word
is
plus
"gen".
unknown
speaker
and
the
patient
has
never
even
seen
the
drug
before
in
most
cases,
so
how
would
he
know
what
the
color
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
case
really
rests
on
the
fact
that
it's
a
maintenance
drug
then.
unknown
speaker
but
all
that
seems
to
me
is
that
it's
more
likely
that
there
will
be
confusion
or
misunderstanding
if
it's
not
a
maintenance
drug,
because
they
don't
know
what
color
to
expect.
all
they
get
is
a
prescription,
and
they
go
in,
and
the
druggist
gives
them
a
generic
substitute.
unknown
speaker
he'd
have
to
rely
on
the
druggist
and
the
doctor.
unknown
speaker
particularly
if
nothing
happens
to
him
when
he
does
the
substitute,
and
i
guess
nobody
ever
goes
after
the
pharmacists.
unknown
speaker
ms.
driscoll--
--to
what
extent--
--go
ahead.
to
what
extent
does
your
case
turn
on
proof
of
intent
to
deceive?
unknown
speaker
ms.
driscoll,
why
doesn't
the
clear
marking
on
the
capsule
go
a
long
way
toward
solving
the
problem
of
druggist
misconduct.
mislabeling
is
very
easy
to
detect
when
it's
printed
right
on
it
ives.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
we're
talking
about
pharmacist
misconduct
on
which
you
have
been
relying.
certainly
the
pharmacists
can
read,
and
they
understand
that
if
it
says
ives,
it's
not
something
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
ives
is
so
concerned,
i
suppose
they
could
print
a
bigger
name
on
the
capsule.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
true
that
when
they
told
them
it
was
the
generic,
it
was
in
response
to
a
specific
question?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bass,
i
notice
we've
talked
about
the
standard
this
morning
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
and
about
whether
the
court
followed
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
i
note
that
your
petition
for
certiorari
didn't
raise
either
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree,
or
don't
you,
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
the
clearly
erroneous
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
raise
it
in
a
petition...
in
your...
as
a
question.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
different
standard
of
law
under
section
32
than
the
district
court
did?
unknown
speaker
so
you...
you...
you...
all...
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
standard
of
law
that
the
district
court
used
and
just
disagreed
with
the
factual
application.
