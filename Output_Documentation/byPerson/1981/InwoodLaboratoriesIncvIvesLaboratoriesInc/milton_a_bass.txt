mr.
milton
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
dispute
between
generic
manufacturing
companies
and
brand
name
companies,
the
generic
manufacturers
are
seeking
to
get
a
larger
share
of
the
drug
industry,
of
the
drug
market.
the
brand
name
companies
are
seeking
to
retain
or
increase
their
dominant
position
in
the
prescription
drug
market.
it
has
been
variously
reported
that
they
have
approximately
90
percent
of
the
prescription
drug
market
at
this
time.
what
the
brand
name
companies
are
asking,
what
they're
asking
for
the
court
to
give
them
is
a
monopoly
on
color.
they're
asking
this
for
a
competitive
advantage,
and
that's
why
we
are
here.
both
sides
in
this
dispute
claim
they
speak
in
the
public
interest.
we
believe
that
our
position
weighs
more
heavily
in
the
public
interest
than
that
of
the
brand
name
companies.
if
the
brand
name
companies
are
given
a
monopoly
on
color,
i
respectfully
submit
they
will
be
able
to
use
that
advantage
for
unfair
competition
whether
or
not
it
is
found
by
this
court
that
there
is
functionality
present.
the
question
of
whether
there
is
functionality
will
depend
upon
the
definition
that
this
court
lays
down.
but
irrespective
of
whether
there
is
a
fact
of
functionality,
even
then
i
believe
it
will
be
used
to
the
great
advantage
of
the
brand
name
companies
and
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
generic
companies
for
this
reason.
the
respondent
and
the
pma,
the
association
that
represents
the
brand
name
companies,
have
submitted
briefs
to
this
court,
and
they
have
said
to
this
court
color
serves
no
function
other
than
to
deceive
the
consumer.
they
have
said
that
to
this
court
in
order
to
get
the
color
monopoly
they
seek.
but
when
they
speak
outside
of
this
court,
they
do
not
say
color
has
no
purpose
or
no
function.
on
the
contrary,
we
have
found
that
one
company,
for
example,
issued
a
document
to
its
salesmen
for
discussion
with
physicians
to
convince
them
that
they
should
prescribe
the
brand
name
product
and
not
the
generic
product.
and
they
said...
they
didn't
say
what
they
told
the
courts,
color
has
no
function;
they
said
color
has
advantages.
if
you
change,
some
patients
may
become
concerned
that
it's
been
changed.
they
said
particularly
in
the
hospitals,
if
you
change
the
color,
if
you
don't
keep
prescribing
the
brand
name
product,
you'll
have
problems
with
all
personnel
handling
the
medications.
explanations
alone
will
be
time
consuming.
they'll
require
additional
checks.
possible
confusion
and
additional
effort
will
result.
now,
that's--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--a
statute?
mr.
milton
a.
bass
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
correct.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
case
comes
up
on
an
alleged
violation
of
section
32,
and
more
precisely,
whether
the
defendant
manufacturers
are
guilty
of
contributory
liability
or
contributory
violative
conduct.
but
i
would
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
the
question
of
functionality
is
essential,
in
my
view,
to
a
consideration
of
this
problem
because
when
these
cases
have
been
presented
in
the
district
courts,
in
the
lower
courts,
that
is
the
argument
that
has
been
presented
to
the
court
time
and
time
again:
color
has
no
purpose
except
to
deceive.
and
i
believe
that
is
the
reason
we're
here
today;
that
the
lower
courts
have
accepted
that
proposition.
and
therefore,
with
due
respect,
i
merely
wish
to
point
out
that
no
matter
what
your
honor
decides
is
the
definition
of
functionality,
well,
i
believe
this
itself
is
functionality,
that
our
ability
to
effectively
compete...
i'm
not
saying
we
cannot
compete...
to
effectively
compete
will
be
damaged
if
they
can
say
to
the
doctor
do
not
prescribe
the
generic
because
you'll
cause
confusion,
mistake,
error,
patient
resistance,
whether
that's
true
or
not,
even
though
we
will
submit,
as
i
will
discuss
now,
it
is
true.
so
that
the
strict
legal
question,
your
honor,
you
are
correct,
is
are
we
guilty
of
contributory
violative
conduct.
but
i--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
must
be
done,
and
i
can
do
it
now,
or
i
intended
to
address
it.
the
reason
i
wanted
to--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--well,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
there
is
one
other
factor
that
is
relevant.
inherent
in
applying
the
standard
that
the
second
circuit
discussed
both
in
ives
ii
and
ives
iv,
both
the
first
decision
written
by
judge
friendly
and
the
second
by
judge
mansfield,
one
of
the
rules
laid
down
is
that
you
will
find
contributory
liability
if
you
suggest
even
by
implication
that
you
should
commit
illegal
substitution
or
mislabeling.
the
second
part
that
judge
friendly
mentioned
was
if
you
continue
to
sell
to
someone
you
know
is
illegally
committing
these
acts.
in
discussing
the
question
of
whether
you
come
within
the
first
prong
of
that
rule,
if
that
is
the
rule
this
court
should
adopt,
that
if
you
suggest
even
by
implication,
whether
or
not
there
is
functionality
becomes
relevant,
separate
and
apart
even
from
the
question
of
relief.
but
even
liability
itself
will
hinge
on
whether
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
functionality.
and
the
reason
why
the
respondent
and
the
other
briefers
make
great
moment
of
that
question
is
precisely
because
i
believe
they
cannot
sustain
any
position
unless
they
can
convince
this
court
that
color
serves
no
purpose.
if
color
serves
a
purpose,
they
have
then
lost
their
basic
position
to
get
a
color
monopoly,
because
that
is
what
they
are
saying
to
the
court
constituted
the
suggestion.
now,
i
will,
your
honor,
be
happy
to
address
it
right
now.
when
judge
friendly
in
ives
ii
said
the
standards
we're
using
are
twofold...
either
you
suggest
even
by
implication
that
you
should
commit
the
wrongful
act,
or
you
continue
selling...
he
said
also
he
was
adopting
judge
wyzanski's
discussion
and
rule
in
the
coca-cola-snow
crest
case.
when
it
came
to
the
ives
iv
decision
in
which
the
majority
opinion
was
written
by
judge
mansfield,
he
said
he
was
applying
that
rule,
and
to
come
within
that
rule
he
said
there
were
a
number
of
factors.
he
said
the
color,
which
was
the
same.
he
said
there
were
catalogs
and
price
lists
which
compared
prices
and
mentioned
the
color
of
both
products.
significantly,
when
the
respondent
submitted
its
brief
in
this
case,
it
did
not
adopt
what
judge
mansfield
said,
even
though
he
ruled
in
their
favor.
they
are
trying
to
contend
and
argue
that
color
alone,
color
alone
comes
within
the
rule
to
constitute
the
suggestion.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
twofold:
first,
that
is
not
a
proper
rule
to
be
adopted;
and
secondly,
that
this
court
of
appeals
did
not
properly
apply
the
rule
in
terms
of
showing
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
requirement
laid
down
in
ives
ii,
if
that
is
the
rule
this
court
agrees
with.
because
when
ives
ii
came
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
effectively
said
color
is
not
enough
to
constitute
a
suggestion
by
implication
or
otherwise
that
you
should
commit
an
illegal
act,
violate
the
criminal
code
because
we
sell
it
in
the
same
color,
because
if
that
were
adequate,
the
court
would
not
have
sent
it
back
and
said
a
trial
will
have
further
evidence
to
see
what
each
side
can
introduce
to
try
to
come
within
or
negate
compliance
with
that
rule
of
liability.
and
in
that
regard
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
is
relevant
and
significant.
when
judge
friendly
sent
the
case
back
for
trial,
he
said
you've
give
us
15
instances
of
illegal
substitution.
i
don't
think
this
is
of
any
moment.
this
is
not
extensive.
though
i
might
point
out
we
later
found
out
there
were
really
only
four;
they
found
four
cases
of
illegal
substitution
in
the
united
states...
one
in
philadelphia,
pennsylvania,
one
in
tylertown,
mississippi,
and
two
in
new
york
city.
and
what
did
they
do
when
they
came
back
with
the
additional
evidence?
they
did
not
conduct
a
study,
which
judge
friendly
asked
them
to
do,
to
try
to
show
more
extensive
illegal
substitution.
they
showed...
there
was
an
indictment
against
six
pharmacists
for
illegal
substitution.
that
was
all
they
showed.
but
the
study
they
conducted,
allegedly
to
follow
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
was
on
legal
substitution.
and,
your
honors,
i
respectfully
ask
how
can
legal
substitution
be
connected
with
or
related
to
contributory
violative
conduct?
in
other
words,
if
the
substitution
isn't
legal
under
the
law,
how
can
we
say
the
manufacturer
is
suggesting
to
the
pharmacist
that
he
comply
with
the
law,
sell
my
product,
the
generic
product
but
put
his
trademark
on
it?
why?
what
motive
is
there
for
the
manufacturer
to
tell
the
pharmacist
you
have
the
legal
right,
the
law
says
you
can
legally
substitute?
ives
isn't
losing
a
sale.
it's
not
its
sale.
under
the
substitution
law
it's
mine,
the
generic
companies.
so
what
they
did
to
try
to
prove
what
the
ives
ii
court
asked
them
to
do
was
come
in
with
a
survey
on
legal
substitution.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
there
was
a
complete
failure
of
proof.
but
what
we
are
trying
to
ask
this
court
today
is
not--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
that's
correct.
and,
your
honor--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--absolutely,
your
honor.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
this:
they
are
trying
to
put
in
evidence
to
prove
that
the
manufacturer
is
guilty
of
contributory
trademark
infringement,
and
they
are
trying
to
do
it
by
saying
the
manufacturer
sells
his
product
to
the
pharmacist
in
the
same
color.
and
they
say
he's
telling
him
you
commit
the
wrongful
act
of
writing
their
name
on
your
label
to
the
consumer.
and
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
is
how
do
we
get
that
causal
connection?
what
nexus
can
there
be,
what
motivation?
mr.
milton
a.
bass
yes.
there
has
to
be
a
showing
or
proof
of
culpability
on
the
part
of
the
manufacturer.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
it
is
conceivable
or
theoretically
possible,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
generic
company
acting
with
guilty
intent
or
wrongful
intent
or
have
any
thought
of
wanting
to
tell
the
pharmacist
by
any
means...
by
telegram,
letter,
or
using
the
same
color
here
as
they're
claiming...
to
go
and
commit
a
trademark
infringement
when
i'm
selling
a
product
for
a
legal
sale,
and
it's
being
sold
legally.
their
theory,
your
honor,
was
originally
that
an
illegal
substitution...
the
pharmacist
is
palming
off
my
product...
so
they're
saying
the
manufacturer
is
trying
to
get
more
sales
to
have
his
product
substituted
illegally.
that
was
their
theory,
reading
into
his
mind
that
state
of
mind.
and
i'm
suggesting
for
whatever
reason
they
had,
they
didn't
go
out
and
try
to
prove
more
extensive
illegal
substitution,
which
ives
ii
court
found
no
showing
of
any
moment.
but
i
appear,
your
honors,
not
primarily
to
say
to
you
it
was
applied
incorrectly,
which
i
believe
the
case
was
decided
incorrectly--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
no,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
we
don't
have
the
exact
figure
of
pharmacists.
there's
been
an
estimate
of
approximately
100,000
users,
maybe
25,000
pharmacists.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
i
mean
doctors.
we
don't--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--how
many
today?
mr.
milton
a.
bass
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
the
only
one
i
know
of,
there's
a
hauck,
there's
a
regional
manufacturer
in
georgia.
i
don't...
there
would
be
some
others,
your
honor.
i'm
not
certain
of
which
others.
incidentally,
i
must
amend,
though,
the
answer,
sir.
in
this
case
two
of...
the
two
manufacturers,
premo
and
inwood,
are
not
presently
manufacturing
it
pending
the
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
ives,
yes,
that
i
know
of.
actually
it's
ives
basically
would
be
the
one
manufacturer.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
no,
they
do
not.
they
use
a
red
capsule
for
their
product.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
i
mean
right
now,
yes.
after
the
decision
when
they
were
compelled
to
change--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--yes.
the
company
would
have
to
change.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
the
purpose
of
identical
colors,
your
honor,
is
to
maximize
the
ability
to
compete.
one
example--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--no,
sir.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
the
purpose
is
to
make
them
think
it's
the
same
drug,
not
the
same
manufacturer.
the
purpose...
i'll
have
to
use
plural,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
with
due
respect...
the
first
purpose
i
tried
to
refer
to
is
that
if
we
do
not
make
it
in
the
same
color,
they
go
to
the
doctors,
who
is
the
purchaser
here,
who
prescribes
the
product,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
and
they
say
color
is
important;
you'd
better
prescribe
my
product
or
otherwise
there
will
be
problems
and
confusion.
second,
doctors
say
that.
there
was
an
amicus
brief
by
an
organization
of
doctors
who
also
said
to
this
court
color
isn't
important.
but
when
they
issue
their
own
papers
here,
they
say
in
a
poll
in
florida
there
were
99
percent
of
the
people
who
said
if
they
had
a
different
color
they'd
call
their
doctor,
and
they
would
have
those
calls.
color
is
important,
your
honor,
for
doctor-patient
communication.
when
the
doctor...
if
a
person
is
taking
a
number
of
medications
and
the
doctor
tells
the
patient
you'll
take
the
red
one
at
2:00,
the
green
one
at
4:00,
it's
an
aid
for
identification.
in
that
respect
it's
an
aid
with
respect
to
co-mingling.
when
an
individual
is
taking
a
number
of
medications,
your
honor,
they
carry
them
in
a
vial.
they
identify
the
product
by
color...
not
the
manufacturer,
by
the
color.
to
the
same
extent,
your
honor,
there
is
an
aid
in
an
emergency
situation...
not
a
final
determination
but
an
aid
to
have
the
color.
color
prevents
confusions
at
all
levels...
pharmacy,
in
the
hospitals
who
handle
drugs.
color
is
an
important
factor.
it
is
an
important
competitive
factor
because
they
make
it
so
and
because
there
is
resistance.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
no.
the
reverse,
your
honor.
for
example,
the
premise
determines
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
if
it
distinguishes
the
medicine,
if
we
say
it's
either
the
same
medicine
or
a
different
medicine,
then
it's
aiding
identification
preventing
confusion.
if
it
identifies
source,
then
there
would
be
confusion,
your
honor.
but
that's
the
key
to
the
issue.
now,
take
ives.
when
ives
sells
its
products,
it
really
doesn't
use
color
as
a
source.
it
puts
out
one
product
in
blue,
one
in
orange,
one
in
yellow,
and
one
in
green;
and
it
says
each
color
says
i
am
ives.
lily
has
a
green
product,
blue
product,
yellow
product
that
says
each
color
is...
i
am
lily.
is
that
a
rational
way
to
try
to
identify
me
as
the
source?
if
they
really
wanted
to
identify
source,
your
honor,
they
would
take
a
symbol,
a
star.
if
they
want
to
put
on
that
capsule
a
blue
star
which
then
they
advertise
says
i
am
an
ives
product
on
all
their
products,
i
think
they're
right
and
should
do
it
to
identify
the
source.
but
the
color
doesn't
do
it.
look
at
the
products
in
this
case.
in
the
200
milligram
they
make
it
in
blue.
in
the
400
milligram
they
make
it
in
red
and
blue.
each
one...
does
that
each
one
say
i'm
ives?
it
will
confuse
the
patient
if
it
was
talking
about
source;
but
it
does
tell
the
patient
the
truth:
i
am
a
different
medicine.
i,
the
blue,
am
200
milligrams.
i,
the
red
and
blue,
are
400
milligrams.
and,
your
honor,
you've
touched
one
of
the
very
problems
we
have.
what
they're
saying
to
the
court
is
give
me
the
color
monopoly;
force
him
to
change
the
color
so
i
will
be
saying
to
the
patient
you've
got
a
different
medicine,
because
i
speak,
color
is
speaking,
saying
i
am
the
same
medicine
or
i
am
different.
and
if
i
have
to
put
a
different
color--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--that
patient--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
if
they
want
to--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--here's
the
distinction.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
that
was
an
example.
let
me
explain,
your
honor.
my
position
is
the
color
of
the
capsule
or
the
pill
identifies
the
product
and
either
says
to
the
patient
i--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--no,
sir.
they
don't
even
say
i
want
anything,
your
honor.
that's
the
point
about
this
industry.
in
this
industry
the
patient
doesn't
choose;
the
doctor
is
the
purchaser.
he
prescribes
and
the
patient
doesn't
even
see
it
until
he
goes
home,
your
honor.
but
let
me
explain
the
star
because
i'm
going
to
change
the
star
to
the
name,
when
i
was
answering
justice
rehnquist.
when
the
patient
picks
up
the
200
milligram
blue
from
ives,
it
has
the
name
ives
on
it,
the
source.
when
he
picks
up
the
red
and
blue,
it
has
the
name
ives,
too.
so
if
he
wants
to
use
ives
to
identify
the
source,
or
a
star,
your
honor,
that's
fine.
but
the
appearance,
the
basic
appearance,
the
basic
color
speaks
to
the
patient
i
am
the
same
medicine
or
a
different
medicine.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
the
color-blind
patient,
your
honor,
will
need
another
method
for
identification,
communication
and
other
purposes.
unfortunately,
we
cannot
solve
the
whole
problem.
in
fact,
one
of
the
unfortunate
things,
your
honor,
is
in
my
view
we
should
have
a
requirement
that
all
medications
in
their
overall
appearance
as
to
color,
shade
and
size
should
be
the
same
to
prevent
confusion
and
to
help
in
terms
of
the
patient,
doctor,
pharmacist
and
nurse
in
their
use
of
the
products,
and
if
there's
a
sincere
need
or
desire.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
it
is
not
before
us,
but
we
are
trying
to
accomplish
part
of
the
result.
the
answer
is,
your
honor,
when
i
started,
why
are
we
here?
it's
why
is
because
they
want
to
counter
the
drug
substitution
laws.
forty-nine
states
in
this
country
the
state
legislatures
have
passed
substitution
laws
stating
the
public
interest
be
to
encourage
substitution.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
indiana,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--yes.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
if
they
don't
trademark
it,
they
could
get
secondary
meaning
and
use
it,
your
honor,
for
identification
of
source.
we
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
our
only
dispute
is
that
they
are
trying
to
get
a
monopoly
upon
and
appropriate
the
whole
appearance.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
no,
i
don't
deny
it
can.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
all
right.
first,
i
would
like
to
equate
the
star
with
the
name.
the
name
ives
to
identify
source
or
some
distinctive
little
star
i
would
put
in
the
same
category.
the
color
is
the
overall
appearance
that
the
patient
sees
to
identify
his
medicine,
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
and
i
separate
what
functions
they're
playing.
you
see,
in
this
industry
there's
something
very
unique.
we
are
not
looking
at
products
that
are
sitting
on
a
shelf,
and
a
consumer
comes
in
and
chooses
a
product,
and
there's
a
question
of
deception
or
palming
off
when
he
chooses
one
product
against
another.
in
the
prescription
drug
industry
he
doesn't
even
seen
it
until
he
goes
home
after
he
picked
it
up
at
the
pharmacy.
the
doctor
prescribes
the
product
and
decides
what
he'll
get.
so
that
the
overall
appearance
and
color
plays
no
function
in
the
purchase.
the
whole
classic
or
historical
purpose
is
not
present
here,
so
there
is
a
basic
distinction,
your
honor,
in
what
we
are
contending
here
today.
in
answer
to
justice
powell's
question
of
functionality,
though,
if
i
might
state,
although
we
submit
that
all
of
these
elements
that
constitute
functionality...
questions
of
patient-doctor
communication,
the
co-mingling
problem,
the
confusion
problem,
or
even
what
parke-davis
calls
the
psychological
problem
in
which
they
actually
issued
a
paper
that
color
itself
answers
a
positive
or
negative
action.
you
wouldn't
have
a
certain
kind
of
black
pill
or
a
certain
kind
of
other
negative
pill,
your
honor.
we
think
the
emergency
aid.
we
think
these
are
functional,
but
our
submission,
as
stated
earlier,
even
if
the
rule
or
definition
of
functionality
does
not
encompass
all
of
those,
the
reality
of
the
commercial
dispute
that
competition
exists
here
will
still
exist,
and
we
know
that
that
is
not
speculation
but
actually
the
fact
of
what
is
occurring.
thank
you.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do.
i
would
like
to
first
note,
justice
stevens,
that
in
the
question
that's
been
answered
as
to
the
survey
and
the
projectability
of
this
29
percent,
that
survey
of
mislabeling
where
the
generic
was
dispensed
as
permitted
in
the
prescription,
they
had
10
pharmacists
who
used
the
name
cyclospasmol
in
some
form
on
the
label.
nine
of
those
10
told
the
patient
you're
getting
a
generic.
and
when
they
charged
the
patient,
the
average
price
charged
was
$6.50;
when
they
gave
the
brand
name
it
was
$13
in
that
study.
that
is
the
study
counsel
was
referring
to,
your
honor,
in
the
projection--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--yes,
but
not
the
question
counsel
said.
she
said
they
asked
did
you
give
me
a
generic.
that
was
not
the
question
in
the
protocol.
they
asked
do
you
carry
a
generic
after
he
gave
them
the
prescription
and
charged
them
the
lower
price,
and
he
answered
i
gave
you
a
generic.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
also,
justice
o'connor,
your
question
about
the
name
ives
on
the
capsule
is
most
appropriate,
because
not
only
do
my
over-50
eyes
read
that
ives,
but
they
refused
to
include
the
ives
pill
in
those
pills
she
showed
the
patients
when
the
very
company
doing
the
survey
recommended
they
put
the
ives
there;
but
we
can
only
surmise
why
they
didn't
want
to
include
for
those
test
subjects
the
word
ives.
now,
justice
powell,
i'd
like
to
correct
an
answer
i
gave
you
because
i
misunderstood
your
question
earlier.
you
asked
me
about
manufacturers
of
cyclospasmol
in
the
same
color.
i
thought
you
were
asking
me
today,
and
i
answered
as
i
did.
however,
i
am
told
you
asked
in
more
general
form.
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
second
circuit
there
were
about
22
companies
selling
cyclospasmol
in
the
same
color.
one
company,
this
hauck
from
georgia,
sold
it
in
red.
this
is
a
practice
and
this
record
that
shows
goes
back
40
years,
the
generic
companies
selling
the
products
in
the
same
color.
counsel
has
referred
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
about
judge
wyzanski's
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
snow
crest
and
coca-cola,
and
she
referred
again
numerous
times
this
afternoon
about
the
pharmacists.
and
i
would
only
humbly
suggest
it
is
misplaced.
judge
wyzanski
said
bartenders
are
not
so
unique
that
they
would
be
deemed
to
be
people
who
would
commit
a
wrongful
act
in
substituting
another
cola
for
coca-cola.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
that
pharmacists
should
be
denominated
worse
than
bartenders
and
should
be
considered
unique
to
commit
criminal
acts
to
have
premised
their
argument
made
to
this
court
today.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
no.
i
think
they
tried
to
avoid
it,
as
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
mulligan
states.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
no.
mr.
milton
a.
bass
definitely
not,
your
honor.
ives
ii
said
to
the
district
court
you
didn't
apply--
mr.
milton
a.
bass
--in
ives
iv.
in
ives
ii
they
said
you
used
the
wrong
standard.
then
it
went
back
to
the
district
court
for
trial.
in
ives
iv
the
court
said
we
disagree
that
he
didn't
give
weight
to
certain
evidence
like
the
catalogs.
but
the
standard,
your
honor,
is
precisely
what
you
said
this
morning.
the
standard
was
not
the
issue
the
court
took
with
the
district
court
in
ives
decision
iv
and
in
judge
mansfield's
decision,
no,
sir.
