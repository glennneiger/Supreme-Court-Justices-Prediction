mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
the
indiana
judgments
relating
to
the
rehabilitation
of
unac,
as
the
insurance
company
involved
in
this
case
is
colloquially
called,
are
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
in
north
carolina
as
a
result
of
the
procedures
that
were
implemented.
there
are
two
judgments
of
the
indiana
court
that
unac
submits
are
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
and
preclude
relitigation
of
the
issues
that
the
respondents
seek
to
raise.
the
history
of
this
proceeding
started
in
1974,
when
the
indiana
department
of
insurance,
pursuant
to
a
statutory
mandate
to
take
over
the
operations
of
a
failing
insurance
company
organized
under
indiana
law,
did
just
that.
as
a
result,
pursuant
to
the
indiana
statute,
the
indiana
insurance
commissioner,
as
rehabilitator,
became
in
possession
of
the
business
and
assets
of
unac.
that
is
the
statutory
language.
subsequent
to
that
time,
a
notice
was
sent
out
by
the
court.
the
first
notice
that
went
out
in
1975
was
a
rule
23(b)(3)
notice
with
which
this
court
is
fully
familiar,
because
indiana
trial
procedure
is
exactly
the
same
as
federal
trial
procedure
in
this
respect,
and
just
about
exactly
at
the
same
time
that
the
indiana
commissioner
took
over
unac,
unac
was
sued
in
two
class
actions,
one
in
state
court
in
illinois
and
one
in
federal
court
in
virginia.
the
state
court
in
illinois
case
was
removed
to
federal
court
in
illinois,
and
each
case
was
then
stayed
pursuant
initially
to
an
injunction
issued
by
the
indiana
court
and
then
ultimately
by
agreement.
the
class
plaintiffs
in
those
two
lawsuits
then
intervened
in
the
indiana
proceeding,
and
those
class
plaintiffs
were
ultimately
certified
as
class
plaintiffs
on
behalf
of
all
policyholders.
the
claims
they
were
asserting
were
essentially
that
unac
had
defrauded
the
policyholders
into
entering
into
the
policyholder
relationship.
so,
the
first
thing
that
went
out
was
a
rule
23(b)(3)
notice
with
respect
to
those
claims.
it
also
explicitly
told
the
policyholders
that
whether
or
not
you
opt
out
of
the
class
pursuant
to
rule
23(b)(3),
you
may
ultimately
be
bound
by
a
plan
of
rehabilitation
in
your
capacity
as
a
policyholder.
we
don't
know
at
this
time
whether
there
will
be
a
plan
of
rehabilitation,
but
if
there
is
one,
you
are
in
court
in
indiana
in
your
policyholder
capacity,
irrespective
of
whether
you
want
these
plaintiffs
to
represent
you
in
prosecuting
these
fraud
claims.
so,
there
are
two
jurisdictional
hooks,
if
you
will,
operating
on
this
situation.
no
north
carolina
policyholder
opted
out.
as
a
result,
all
of
the
north
carolina
policyholders
were
in
court
in
indiana,
both
as
class
plaintiffs
and
as
policyholders.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
we
would
have
a
different
situation
with
respect
to
one
issue,
but
not
as
to
the
fundamental
issue
that
unac
relies
on,
which
is
that
qua
policyholders,
the
policyholders
are
bound
by
the
plan
of
rehabilitation,
which
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
in
all
states
once
entered
as
a
judicial
decree.
there
is
a
second,
if
you
will,
fall-back
position
that
unac
has
that
they
are
also
bound
as
non-opting
out
plaintiffs
by
a
settlement
of
their
class
claims
as
well,
but
that
raises
another
whole
complex
of
issues
as
to
the
nature
of
a
multi-state
rule
23(b)(3)
claim,
and
how
the
plaintiffs
relate
to
the
state
of
jurisdiction.
there
are
cases
that
hold,
and
they
are
cited
in
our
brief...
the
kansas
supreme
court
shutts
case
is
the
leading
one,
that
holds
that
a
plaintiff
who
is
a
member
of
a
class
is
in
court
and
can
be
bound
even
though
he
is
not
a
resident
of
the
state
and
has
no
other
jurisdictional
connection
with
the
state,
but
that
issue
is
only
reached
in
this
case
if
you
should
hold,
which
we
submit
would
be
incorrect,
that
unac's
plan
of
rehabilitation
cannot
bind
the
policyholders
as
such.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
sir.
at
that
point
in
my
narrative,
that
happened.
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association
intervened
at
the
point
after
the
class
was
certified,
and
after
the
time
for
opting
out
had
expired,
but
before
any
plan
of
rehabilitation
had
been
implemented.
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association,
as
you
know,
is
here
in
its
capacity
as
assignee
of
the
policyholders'
claims
by
operation
of
the
north
carolina
statutory
framework,
which
makes
them
liable
to
make
good
on
the
policyholders
but
also
gives
them
whatever
rights
it
gives
the
company.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
second.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
second.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
really
the
supplemental.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
it
is
pending.
oral
argument
was
held
a
few
months
ago,
and
the
court
took
it
under
submission
and
indicated
that
it
would
stay
proceedings
pending
a
resolution
of
this
court's
proceeding.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
they
are
waiting
for
you,
is
what
it
boils
down
to.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
the
key
point,
or
key
point.
that
1976
judgment
that
implemented
the
plan
of
rehabilitation
is
binding,
and
the
time
for
appeal
has
run,
and
it
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
now,
when
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association,
subsequent
to
the
plan's
implementation,
and
subsequent
to
its
becoming
a
binding
final
judgment,
instituted
a
lawsuit
in
north
carolina.
at
that
point,
unac
went
back
into
court
under
the
continuing
jurisdiction
provisions
of
the
rehabilitation
decree
and
said
essentially,
court,
what
do
we
do?
we
have
been
sued
in
north
carolina,
we
think
we
shouldn't
be
continuing
to
honor
the
service
agreement
that
we've
got
with
the
guaranty
association,
if
they
are
claiming
they
are
entitled
to
something
beyond
what
they
get
under
the
rehabilitation
plan.
the
indiana
court
then
held
another
hearing
at
which
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association
appeared
and
argued
and
was
heard
and
presented
its
arguments.
essentially,
the
issue
presented
by
that
hearing
was,
is
the
first
judgment
conclusive,
and
the
indiana
court
said,
yes,
i
decided
this
once
before,
and
i
am
deciding
it
again,
and
i
had
jurisdiction
then
and
i
have
it
now,
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
that
is
what
is
on
appeal,
that
second
order.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
it
occurred
before
any
judgment
was
entered
in
north
carolina.
it
was
after
the
complaint
was
filed
and
before
any
judgment
or
summary
judgment
motion
was
entered.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
indiana
court.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
indiana
court
clearly
under
settled
rules
of
res
judicata.
the
first
judgment
wins,
i
think,
under
settled
rules
of
both
indiana
and
federal
procedure.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
although
i
am
frank
to
say,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
know
what
subject
matter
jurisdiction
means
in
this
context.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
context
means,
is
there
a
federal
question,
is
there
diversity.
in
the
state
context,
we
had
a
court
here
of
general
jurisdiction
in
indiana,
and
it
had
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
any
dispute,
any
dispute
that
is
cognizable
by
an
indiana
court,
and
this
is
one
of
them.
the
only
question
is,
did
it
have
personal
jurisdiction,
we
submit,
over
the
parties,
and
it
clearly
did
as
to
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
oh,
yes.
indeed,
it
is
a
judicial
decree,
your
honor.
all
the--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--yes,
sir,
it
is
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
indeed,
all
the
administrative
proceeding
is,
it
is
not
an
administrative
proceeding
at
all.
the
administrator
is
a
party
to
the
proceeding,
and
he
proposes
a
plan
of
rehabilitation.
you
then
send
out
a
notice
to
everybody
in
the
world
who
might
be
affected
by
it,
which
included,
by
the
way,
the
state
insurance
commissioners
of
all
50
states
as
well
as
policyholders,
creditors,
agents,
all
manner
of
people.
you
then
hold
a
hearing
at
which
everybody--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
it
is
argued
that
the
commissioner
of
insurance
is
the
custodian.
now,
apparently
under
indiana...
under
north
carolina
law
the
deposit
is
made
with
the
insurance
commissioner,
who
then
registers
it
in
the
name
of
the
treasurer,
but
it
is
the
insurance
commissioner
who
receives
the
deposit
and
to
whom
unac
gave
it.
now,
if
he
turned
around
and
holds
it
in
street
name,
if
you
will,
that
is
his
business,
is
our
view.
it
is
the
insurance
commissioner
who
is
the
arm
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
is
involved
here,
and
he
was
given
notice.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
sir,
that
is
exactly
what
it
is,
i
think,
in
common
sense
terms.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
right,
and
the
reason,
of
course,
that
you
have
a
statutory
proceeding
is
that
the
bankruptcy
laws
don't
apply
to
insurance.
otherwise,
you
really
wouldn't
need
this...
this
relatively
unusual
state
law
creature.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
correct.
they
are
parties
defendant,
by
the
way.
the
plaintiffs
sued
them
along
with
unac
for
whatever
interest
they
may
have.
they
then
filed
a
cross
claim
that
in
effect
asked
for
no
relief.
it
is
our
view
that
they
are
nominal
parties
at
best.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
not
exactly,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
think
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
it
in
those
terms.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
it
said
that
all
parties
before
it
are
before...
the
policyholders
are
before
it,
and
that
whatever
claims
they
have
against
any
asset
of
unac,
which
includes
unac's
beneficial
interest
in
the
trust,
are
hereby
compromised
and
dismissed.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
the
policyholders
appeared
and
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association
appeared,
and
the
commissioner--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
there
was
no
argument
about
that
deposit
or
any
deposit
in
any
other
state.
the
only
issue
about
deposits
that
caused
problems
were
those
outside
the
united
states,
where
there
was
a
real
question,
and
the
plan
explicitly
dealt
with
the
problem
that
we
don't
have
a
full
faith
and
credit
clause
that
binds--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--oh,
roughly
40
policyholders
were
there
in
person.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
but
none
of
them
were
north
carolina...
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
they
were
there
in
the
metaphysical
sense,
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no,
they
were
there...
if
nobody
had
ever
intervened
in
this
proceeding,
the
policyholders--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--no,
no,
that
is
not
our
fall-back
position,
if
i
may
respectfully--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--no,
that's
the
fall-back
position.
they
are
also
there
because
they
are
policyholders
of
the
company,
and
if
no
policyholder
had
intervened,
we
still
could
have
had
a
valid
rehabilitation,
simply
by
sending
them
notice.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--oh,
yes,
we
have
that
position,
which
is
a
good
position
and
a
winning
position.
but
if
that
had
not
happened--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--sure.
we're
got
three,
really.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no.
no,
it
depends
on
indiana
law.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no,
sir.
indiana
decides--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--indiana
does
not
decide
that
it
had
that
pot,
nor
did
indiana
decide
that
if
the
north
carolina
policyholder
had
wished
to
assert
a
claim
against
that
pot
in
north
carolina
it
couldn't
have
done
so.
they
could
have
done
so.
a
north
carolina
claim
either
in
north
carolina--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--they
didn't.
they
got
jurisdiction
over
the
claim
of
unac
to
that--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
it's
in
indiana,
where
unac
is,
just
like
all
of
the
assets
are.
in
fact--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--no,
it
is
determined
by
indiana
law.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
it
doesn't,
except
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
no.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
every
policy--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--we
are...
it
is
on
deposit
in
north
carolina.
if
we
default--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--we
can't.
i
mean,
it
is
on
deposit
pursuant
to
this
arrangement--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
the
money
continues
to
remain
in
north
carolina
in--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
i
guess
it
is
fair
to
say
we
are
all
here
because--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
where
does
this
court
get
jurisdiction?
or
where
does
indiana
court?
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
the
dispute
to
the
rights
to
the
money
are
involved.
what
north
carolina
is
saying
is
that
it
can
liquidate
that
sum
and
pay
it
over
to
the
guaranty
association.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
and
we
are
saying
they
can't
do
that--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--because
the
indiana
court
adjudicated
all
that
and
it
is
res
judicata.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
position.
that
is
actually
another
fall-back
position.
the
basic
position
is
that
a
rehabilitation
works
even
if
nobody
appears
in
indiana
court,
that
all
you
need
to
do
to
adjust
the
rights
of
the
indiana
policyholders
and
all
policyholders
in
the
united
states
is
send
them
a
notice
and
say,
here
is
our
plan
of
reorganization,
just
like
a
bankruptcy
court
does,
and
to
the
extent
that
you
are
a
policyholder
of
this
company,
unless
you
appear
and
object,
your
rights
are
going
to
be
adjusted
by
this
plan,
and
if
you
can't
do
that,
you
can't
rehabilitate
an
insurance
company.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
i--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--i
am
not
sure.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no.
no,
we
can
win
on
the
ground
that
justice
brennan
articulated,
and
that--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--sure.
that
only
works
for
north
carolina.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
correct.
that
would
determine
this
case
as
to
the
north
carolina
policyholders.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
absolutely.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
your
honor--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--the
north
carolina
guaranty
association
did,
the
second
time.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
first
time--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--i
don't
disagree
for
a
moment
that
that
is
dispositive
of
this
case,
but
there
is
another,
more
fundamental
point.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no,
but
the
policyholders--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--i
don't
accept
the
premise
that
the
policyholders
weren't
there.
the
policyholders--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--all
right.
i
am
saying
they
were
there--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--no,
but
i
am
saying,
they
were
there
other
than
through
the
association.
they
were
there
at
least
to
the
extent
of
their
claims
against
unac.
there
is
an
in
rem
jurisdiction--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
they
assigned
those
claims.
that
was
what
the
deal
was.
they
took
on--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
they
were
there
through
the
association;
they
were
also
there
in
their
capacity
as
class
plaintiffs
and
in
their
capacity
as
policyholders.
in
other
words,
they
were
there
in
three
capacities,
in
our
submission.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
oh,
i
agree.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
there
would
be
no
question
that
a
nationwide
notice
to
all
creditors
everywhere
would
bind
everyone,
i
think.
that
would
be,
of
course,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
now,
i
am
not
a
bankruptcy
expert,
but
i
am
quite
confident
that
is
correct,
that
a
reorganization
under
the
bankruptcy
laws
works
nationwide.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
think
ultimately
that
would
be
our
position,
yes,
that
that
is
what
it
means
to
say
that
the
indiana
statute
has...
that
the
indiana
commissioner
assumes
title
to
whatever
beneficial
interest
the
company
has.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no,
i
think
that
the
indiana
statute
gives
the
insurance
rehabilitator,
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
insurance,
that
power.
in
that
sense,
the
receivership
analogy
breaks
down,
i
think.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
that
is
just
the--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--that
is
the
deal
the
policyholder
makes
when
he
contracts
with
an
indiana
insurance
company.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
exactly
what
it
amounts
to.
and
indeed,
consider
what
the
situation
is
if
that
is
not
the
law,
if
we
can't
bind
all
creditors
everywhere.
how
do
you
rehabilitate
an
insurance
company.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
oh,
it
does.
it
does.
and
if
a
north
carolina
policyholder
had
said,
i
don't
want
my
rights
under
the
rehabilitation
plan,
i
want
my
rights
under
the
deposit,
he
gets
them,
plain
and
simple.
the
problem
is,
that
didn't
happen
in
regard
to--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--we
sent
him
an
elaborate
plan,
40
pages
long,
that
says
in
six
places--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--well,
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
right,
and
you
assent
to
that
proceeding
by
entering
into
a
contract
with
the
indiana
company.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
of
course
it
is
not,
but
you
don't
have
a
statute
that
says,
in
the
event
your
insurance
company
becomes
insolvent,
the
insurance
commissioner
in
his
state
of
domicile
is
going
to
take
him
over
and
may
adjust
your
rights
vis-a-vis
him.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
only
point
we
make
of
mccarren-ferguson
is
that
it
evidences
a
congressional
policy
to
support
state
regulatory
schemes,
and
to
that
extent
it
supports
the
notion
that
the
indiana
commissioner
can
do
exactly--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--it
does
not,
i
don't
believe,
although
it
could
be
viewed
as
a
congressional
policy
in
part
implementing
the
delegation
of
congress
to
legislate
under
full
faith
and
credit
to
support
these
state
schemes,
and
indeed,
what
the
indiana
commissioner
did
here
is
what
every
rehabilitator
does
in
every
multi-state
rehabilitation,
and
there
is
no
alternative.
if
they
cannot
adjust
all
these
things,
where
are
we?
how
do--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--there
is
no
federal
tribunal,
and
there
is
only
one
state
that
seeks
to
do
this.
this
is
completely
unlike
the
delaware
stott
sequestration
situation,
where
the
jurisdiction
that
is
asserted
is
different
from
the
claim
that
is
being
adjusted.
here,
the
only
jurisdiction
that
is
being
asserted
is
over
the
very
claim
that
is
in
dispute.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
if
we
win--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--if
we
win,
it
stays
there.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
policyholders
have
no
interest
in
this
litigation.
the
policyholders
have
assigned
their
claims
to
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
it
just
gets
the
money,
and
it
puts
it
in
its
general
asset,
and
it
is
that
much
richer,
so
that
it
can...
i
mean,
it
is
going
to
pay
the
claims
whether
or
not
it
gets
the
money
from
us.
it
is
solvent.
it
is
an
association
of
insurers
with
over
600
members,
all
the
big
insurance
companies
that
do
business
in
north
carolina.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
there
is
a
separate
one
created
under
the
statute
of
every
state
that
has
one.
the
oddity
here
is,
the
guaranty
associations
are
a
relatively
recent
national
phenomenon.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
they
have
absolutely
none.
they
have
assigned
whatever
claim
they
have
against
unac
or
any
of
its
assets
to
the
guaranty
association,
and
in
exchange--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--they
have
to
make
up
the
difference
between
what
the
policyholders
will
get
under
the
restructured
policy
and
what
they
had
under
the
original
policy
as
written.
in
other
words,
essentially
what
caused
the
rehabilitation
to
take
place
was,
the
company
was
writing
cadillac
policies
at
volkswagen
prices.
the
guaranty
association
has
to
now
deliver
that
cadillac,
and
gets
the
volkswagen
income,
if
that
is--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--it
puts
them
in
that
posture,
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
well,
assuming
they...
yes,
and
they
could
have
then
elected
to
assert
a
claim
against
the
deposit.
now,
there
is
one
point
that
needs
to
be
made.
they
have
no
practical
need...
i
mean,
this
is
a
little
deposit.
it
is
a
$100,000
face
bond.
it
may
be
$50,000.
one
judgment
that
the
indiana
commissioner
had
to
make
was,
does
it
make
any
sense
at
all
to
have
little
mini-liquidations
going
around
all
over
the
nation
over
essentially
immaterial
amounts
of
money?
the
legal
profession
would
be
the
only
beneficiary
of
that
doctrine.
no
policyholder
would
end
up
better
over
a
squabble
over
how
to
handle
that
$50,000.
i
mean,
that
is
the
practicality
of
this
thing.
and
only
because
we've
got
a
solvent
entity
that
can
pursue
this
claim
do
we
find
ourselves
in
court
here
today,
that
has
an
interest
that
it
seeks
to
assert.
may
i
save
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
i
think...
yes.
they
have
no
interest,
first.
second,
they
were
given
the
same
notice
anybody
else
has,
and
by
the
way,
the
north
carolina
uniform
insurance
liquidation
act
expressly
gives
the
commissioner
the
election
to
seek
to
foreclose
the
deposit
in
that
state
if
it
wants
to,
if
he
determines...
if
he
determines
that
it
makes
economic
sense
to
do
so.
he
didn't
do
that.
the
plan
went
through,
became
a
binding
judgment,
and
now,
after
the
fact,
the
guaranty
association,
having
litigated
this
twice,
wants
to
relitigate.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
he...
of
the
second
provision,
but
not
the
first.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
but
he
is
the
custodian.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
state
of
north
carolina's
arm
that
is
in
charge
of
this
situation
is
the
insurance
commissioner,
not
the
treasurer.
he
is
just
a
registered
holder.
he
has
no
interest
in
the
thing
other
than
doing
what
the
commissioner
tells
him
to
do.
may
i
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
we
don't
accept
the
trust
analogy.
it
is
a
pledge.
the
asset
is
unac's,
always
is,
always
was,
still
is.
it
is
pledged
to
secure
against
the
default,
and
in
the
event
of
default,
and
only
then
can
the
north
carolina
commissioner
arrest
the
interest
payments
and
do
the
other
things
that
he
is
purporting
to
do
here.
there
is
no
default.
unac
and
the
policyholders
reached
an
agreement
whereby
unac
would
offer
ongoing
insurance
and
the
policyholders
accepted
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
oh,
we
agree.
it
is
there.
it
is
in
the
deposit,
and
we
can't
withdraw
it
unless
we
stop
writing
the
insurance
on
north
carolina
insureds,
but
it
is
there
to
secure
a
future
default
should
we
go
in
the
tank
again.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
they
are
seeking
to
liquidate.
the
remedy
they
request
is
that
it
be
paid
over
to
the
guaranty
association.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
correct,
i
suppose.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
although
the
basic--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--yes.
yes.
i
suppose
that
is
correct.
we
haven't
anticipated
that
point,
but
the
logic
of
what
you
say
seems
correct,
and
we
would
have
to
make
another
deposit,
although
i
expect
we
would
as
a
practical
matter
stop
writing
insurance
in
that
state.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
oh,
yes,
and
that
is,
again,
the
basic
point
of
this
case
from
our
point
of
view
is
that
this
is
an
insurance
case,
and
it
is
a
regulated
industry
that
has
a
state
statutory
framework
that
tells
the
state
commissioner
in
the
state
of
domicile
to
do
what
the
indiana
commissioner
did
here,
and
purports
to
make
it
stick
nationwide.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no,
there
is
no
claim
that
unac
is
in
default
of
any
post-rehabilitation
obligation.
unac
is
honoring
its
policies
as
restructured
today.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
your
confusion
is
the
same
as
ours,
your
honor.
we
think
it
is
as
simple
as
day
that
the
policyholders
accepted
the
restructured
policy,
we
are
not
in
default,
and
the
money
is
there
in
its
pledged
state,
if
you
would,
to
secure
future
defaults.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
going
to
be
paid
regardless
of
the
disposition
of
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association's
statutory
obligation
to
the
policyholders,
it
has
to
make
up
the
additional
benefits
to
the
policyholders
in...
unac...
as
between
unac
and
the
policyholders,
the
policies
are
written
down.
now,
it
is
hard
to
explain
this
in
a
few
words,
because
there
is
disability
income
insurance,
and
what
in
effect
they
did
is
change
them
from
non-cancellable,
which
means
you
can't
raise
the
premium,
to
guaranteed
renewable,
which
means
we
keep
insuring
these
people.
we
can't
terminate
them.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
premiums
have
gone
up,
and--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
yes,
it--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--yes,
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
can't
represent
that,
but
i
believe--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--oh,
i
think
so.
it
is
a
question
of
administrative
discretion
whether
they
require
a
deposit
before
they
will
admit
a
company,
but
i
think
most
states
have
a
procedure
for
getting
a
deposit
from
a
company
that
they
regard
as
suspect.
and
in
many
cases
you
end
up
with
the
situation
we
have
here,
where
the
amount
of
the
deposit
is
really
miniscule,
not
enough
to
warrant
the
very
proceeding
that
your
question
focuses
on.
consider
what
would
have
happened
if
every
policyholder
were
perfectly
delighted
with
the
plan
of
rehabilitation
and
nobody
wanted
to
litigate
or
anything.
nonetheless,
the
respondent's
view
would
force
a
mini-liquidation
or
rehabilitation
in
eight
states
where
there
was
nobody
who
was
upset
about
it,
because
there
would
be
no
way
to
make
the
thing
a
binding
adjudication
in
one
form
even
though
nobody
was
upset
about
anything.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
i
think
that
is
what
the
trial
court
held.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
think
so.
i
find
the
appellate
court
opinion
a
little
opaque.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
i
may
be
prejudiced...
i
mean,
my
view
of
the
appellate
court
opinion
may
be
colored
by
what
went
on
in
the
trial
court
that
i
am
aware
of.
that
is
what
the
trial
court
ordered,
and--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--i
think
so.
the
word
"affirmed"
ends
up
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
am
trying
to
parse
the
logic
of
that
opinion.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
sir.
