justice
thurgood
marshall
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
that
court
held
that
an
indiana
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
rights
of
various
parties
in
a
$100,000
deposit
held
in
trust
by
certain
north
carolina
officials.
because
it
found
that
the
indiana
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
the
north
carolina
court
refused
to
recognize
the
indiana
court's
prior
holding
that
all
claims
of
the
deposit
were
compromised,
settled
and
dismissed
by
the
final
order
entered
by
that
court
during
a
rehabilitation
proceeding.
we
therefore
ordered
respondent
guaranty
association
to
liquidate
the
$100,000
deposit.
petitioner,
an
indiana
stock
insurance
corporation,
had
deposited
the
$100,000
as
a
requirement
of
continuing
to
do
business
in
north
carolina.
petitioner
argues
that
the
north
carolina
court
was
obligated
to
recognize
the
prior
judgment
of
the
indiana
court
which
compromised,
settled
and
dismissed
all
rehabilitation
claims
against
the
petitioner.
petitioner
contends
that
since
the
guaranty
association
was
actually
a
party
to
the
indiana
litigation,
it
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
its
claims
to
the
$100,000
deposit
in
that
proceeding.
having
failed
to
do
so,
petitioner
claims
that
the
guaranty
association
is
now
barred
by
res
judicata
from
asserting
any
right
to
liquidate
the
deposit.
and
the
north
carolina
court
was
therefore
obligated
to
get
the
indiana
court
full
faith
and
credit.
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
accept
petitioner's
contentions
and
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
the
guaranty
association
was
a
party
to
the
indiana
rehabilitation
proceeding.
the
indiana
court
clearly
stated
that
all
claims
against
petitioner
including
any
claim
to
the
$100,000
deposit
had
to
be
raised
during
the
rehabilitation
proceedings.
that
court
also
made
clear
that
any
claim
not
asserted
by
the
party
before
it
during
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
would
be
compromised
and
dismissed.
the
respondents
argue
that
the
indiana
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
rights
in
the
north
carolina
deposit.
however
as
our
prior
decisions
made
clear,
any
argument
that
the
indiana
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
rights
of
the
parties
before
it
in
the
north
carolina
deposit
had
to
be
raised
in
the
indiana
proceeding.
as
a
party
to
that
proceeding,
the
guaranty
association
had
ample
opportunity
to
question
the
jurisdiction
of
the
indiana
court
to
settle
this
claim
to
the
deposit.
having
failed
to
exclusively
raise
to
challenge,
it
is
barred
by
principle
to
res
judicata
from
collaterally
raising
this
question
in
north
carolina.
the
judgment
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
in
consistent
with
this
proceeding.
justice
white
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
powell
and
justice
stevens
joined.
