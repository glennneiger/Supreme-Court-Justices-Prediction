mr.
william
s.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
a
condition
to
its
doing
business
in
north
carolina,
unac
agreed
to
transfer
title
to
securities
to
a
trust
located
in
north
carolina,
and
subject
to
north
carolina
trustees.
unac
agreed
that
the
sole
purpose
of
this
trustee,
of
this
trust
would
be
for
the
protection
of
north
carolina
policyholders
in
the
event
that
unac
should
default
on
any
of
its
obligations,
whether
by
reason
of
insolvency
or
otherwise.
unac
subsequently
became
insolvent.
the
final
order
of
rehabilitation
in
the
indiana
court
allowed
unac
to
substantially
diminish
its
policy
obligations
owed
to
policyholders
in
return
for
unac
being
allowed
to
continue
to
do
business.
during
the
entire
pendency
of
the
rehabilitation
proceeding,
there
was
not
one
single
notice
to
the
policyholders
of
the
existence
of
this
deposit
or
their
special
statutory
rights
in
the
deposit.
unac...
or
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
in
indiana
was
conducted
as
if
the
deposit
did
not
exist.
no
one,
least
of
all
the
policyholders,
had
any
idea
that
unac
was...
or
that
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
was
attempting
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
this
deposit.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
our
client
was
aware
of
the
deposit,
justice
stevens,
but
it
had
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
that
unac
was
attempting
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
it.
this
was--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--the
deposit
was
scheduled,
and
i
think
this
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
briefs,
because
of
this
discrepancy,
the
deposit
was
listed
in
the
balance
sheet
of
the
convention
blanks
that
unac
filed
with
the
north
carolina
department
of
insurance
and
with
the
other
departments
of
insurance.
however,
the
deposit
in
that
convention
blank
was
listed
as
a
general
asset
of
the
insolvent
insurer,
which
is
patently
incorrect.
i
don't
think
unac
would
object
to
that
description
of
the
listing
as
being...
as
being
just
as
incorrect
as
it
could
possibly
be.
if
one
were
to
look
at
this
convention
blank,
the
only
assumption
that
he
could
draw
is
that
this
was
a
general
asset
of
the
insolvent
insurer,
which
is
just
not
the
truth.
it
was
a...
not
only
was
it
not
a
general
asset,
it
was
an
asset
to
which
unac
did
not
even
hold
title.
it
had
been
transferred
to
a
trust.
the
terms
of
the
trust
are
the
terms
of
the
uniform
insurance
liquidation
act
in
north
carolina.
they
quite
explicitly
say
that
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
default,
the
deposit
will
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
north
carolina
policyholders.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
it
is
consistent
with...
with
the
many
cases
at
the
state
court
level
that
have
been
decided
with
regard
to
deposits.
indeed,
there
are
two
cases
in
north
carolina,
one
a
federal
court
case
interpreting
north
carolina
law,
and
the
second
a
very
recent
north
carolina
supreme
court
case
that
specifically
says
that
these
deposits
are
a
trust,
and
they
are
not
an
asset
of
the
insolvent
insurer,
and
they
are
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
domiciliary
insolvency
proceeding.
so,
consistent
with
north
carolina
law,
the
guaranty
association
certainly
had
no
basis
on
which
to
conclude
that
unac
was
going
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
this
deposit.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
it
can't
determine
for
itself,
but
i
think
under
durfee
v.
duke,
it
is
certainly
entitled
to
determine
whether
jurisdiction
was
fully
and
fairly
considered
in
the
proceeding
in
the
other
state,
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
subsequent
north
carolina
proceeding.
the
court
looked
at
the
indiana
proceeding.
there
was
absolutely
no
mention
of
the
deposit.
there
was
no
notice
to
the
policyholders
of
either
the
deposit
or
the
statutory
rights
in
it.
the
court
looked
to
the
entire
record
and
saw
absolutely
no
mention
of
this
deposit
within
the
insolvency
proceeding.
indeed,
the
closest
mention
of
any...
of
the
interplay
of
an
insolvency
proceeding
with
this
sort
of
deposit
occurs
in
the
brief
that
unac's
current
counsel
submitted
to
the
rehabilitation
court
in
support
of
rehabilitation.
in
that
brief,
counsel
quotes
from
couch
on
insurance,
a
very
well
recognized
treatise
that
acknowledges...
a
passage
that
acknowledges
that
a
rehabilitation
proceeding
does
not
have
priority
over...
or
does
not
have
control
over
assets
in
another
jurisdiction
when
there
are
special
statutes
in
that
jurisdiction
pertaining
to
this
asset.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
well,
justice
rehnquist,
that
proposition
is
a
little
bit
hard
to
swallow
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
north
carolina
side.
north
carolina
first
challenges
the
jurisdiction
of
indiana
to
determine
the
right
of
the
proceeding.
the
guaranty
association
initiated
a
proceeding
in
north
carolina
saying
that
the
indiana
proceeding
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
deposit.
all
right.
under,
i
think
the
cases
that
this
court
has
handed
down
dealing
with
collateral
attack,
it
is
fairly
obvious
that
a
court
can
come
up
with
the
wrong
conclusion
as
to
jurisdiction,
but
if
it
appears
that
jurisdiction
was
fully
and
fairly
considered,
it
can't
be
attacked.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
court
didn't
come
up
with
any
conclusion,
didn't
fully
and
fairly
consider
jurisdiction
as
to
the
deposit
at
all
in
its
first
proceeding.
then,
when
it
is
about...
when
a
proceeding
is
filed
in
another
state,
starting
a
collateral
attack
as
to
jurisdiction,
and
one,
i
think,
that
unac
could
truly
lose,
unac
initiates
another
proceeding
in
indiana
and
says,
all
right,
we
missed...
we
neglected
to
fully
and
fairly
consider
jurisdiction
in
the
original
proceeding,
but
we
will
fully
and
fairly
consider
it
now,
and
that
will
relate
back
to
the
rehabilitation
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--that
is
correct,
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
north
carolina
when
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
was
collaterally
attacked
in
north
carolina.
it
was
very
clear
that
the
indiana
proceedings
seemed
to
have
swept
this
asset
in
by
mistake,
as
much
as
anything.
it
was
just
totally
unaware
of
the
nature
of
the
asset,
of
the
fact
that
it
was
subject
to
statutes
in
north
carolina.
what
unac
seems
to
be
arguing
is
almost...
could
best
be
termed
jurisdiction
by
mistake
rather
than
jurisdiction
by
necessity
or
anything
else.
we
just
think
jurisdiction
would
not
lie
in
this
situation,
and
the
north
carolina
court
is
free
to
conclude
that,
after
looking
at
the
record
and
determining
whether
jurisdiction
had
been
fully
and
fairly
considered.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
it
could
be
an
asset
in
the
proceeding
in
any
event.
i
think
north
carolina--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--no.
unac
had--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
ultimately,
but
i
think
we
have
a
situation
there
where
all
of
the--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--right.
they
are
at
best
a
contingent
beneficiary
of
this
trust.
to
the
extent
that
they
honor
their
policy
obligations,
then
their
contingent
interest
in
the
trust
would
be
activated,
and
title
would
revert
to
the
indiana
company.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
yes--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
of
the
guaranty
association's
interest?
mr.
william
s.
patterson
yes,
it--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--yes.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
the
policyholders
accepted
something
else?
mr.
william
s.
patterson
yes.
well,
the
policyholders
have
been
made
whole
by
the
guaranty
association.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
yes,
but
if
you
will
look
at
the
definition
of
the
guaranty
association's
interest
in
that
plan,
the
definition
of
the
guaranty
association's
interest
is
that
it
has
the...
it
has
the
same
rights
that
the
policyholders
that
it
made
whole
would
have.
so,
by
virtue
of
subrogation,
it
stands
on--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--i
think
it
would
be
inequitable
to
do
so,
but
probably--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--i
think
the
first--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--well,
the
first
issue
that
would
have
to
be
answered
is
whether
the
indiana
court
had
any
right
to
adjudicate
rights
at
all
in
this
deposit.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
it
is
not
an
asset
of
unac--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--the
guaranty
association's
position
is
that
no
matter
what
the
indiana
rehabilitation
proceedings
said
about
this
asset,
it
simply
lacked
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
the
asset.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
i
don't
think
the
indiana
court
had
any
jurisdiction
to
require
it
to
do
anything
with
the
deposit.
the
deposit
was
clearly
a
north
carolina
asset.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
any
judgment
against
indiana?
mr.
william
s.
patterson
i
am
afraid
i
don't
understand
the
question,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
against
the
guaranty
association?
mr.
william
s.
patterson
would
this
be
based
on
an
assumption
that
the
guaranty
association
had
become
a...
been
assigned
some
sort
of
beneficial
interest
in
the
trust?
mr.
william
s.
patterson
well,
the
trust
is
for
the
sole
benefit
and
protection
of
north
carolina
policyholders.
the
guaranty
association
has
absolutely
no
right
to
this
trust
until
there
has
been
a
default
by
some
insurance
company,
unac
here.
at
that
point,
the
guaranty
association
would
pay
the
policyholders
of
unac
the
amount
of
the
fault,
and
could
then
move
against
the
deposit,
which
is
where
the
policyholders
would
have
gone
absent
the
guaranty
association.
the
north
carolina
statutory
scheme
is
such
that
the
policyholders
really
have
two
sources
to
make
them
whole.
first,
they
have
the
guaranty
association,
which
is
statutorily
required
to
step
in.
if
the
guaranty
association
weren't
there,
they
would
still
have
this
deposit
that
the
policyholders
could
have
gone
to.
the
statutory
scheme
intermeshes,
and
what
happens
is,
if
the
guaranty
association
pays
the
policyholders
off
then
and
only
then
does
the
guaranty
association
become
subrogated
to
the
policyholders'
rights
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
move
against
the
deposit.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
i
think
again
the
full
faith...
the
application
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
has
to
do...
gets
back
to
jurisdiction.
if
the
indiana
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
rights
in
the
deposit,
which
north
carolina
says
it
does,
then
yes,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
is
not
applicable.
i
think
the
initial
question,
though,
should
be,
how
did
indiana
get
around
applying
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
as
to
the
north
carolina
statute,
which
specified
the
policyholder
rights
in
this
deposit?
mr.
william
s.
patterson
i
think
it
would
have
been
had
indiana
or
had
the
rehabilitator
given
anyone
even
the
slightest
hint
that
it
purported
to
be
dealing
with
this
deposit.
until...
it
was
over
a
year
after
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
closed
that
unac
first
contended
that
rights
in
the
deposit
were
cut
off
by
this
rehabilitation
proceeding.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
the
issues
there
are
basically
the
same
as
they
are
here.
the
question
is,
did--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
i
think
it
could
be
in
some
insolvency...
there
could
be
a
rehabilitation
proceeding
that
would
reduce
rights
in
that
way.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
but
at
the
same
time,
the
association
has
a
continuing
obligation
to
make
the
policyholders
whole.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
well,
that's
correct,
but
the
association--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--well,
the
guaranty
association
is
not
a
reinsurer,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
analogized
to
one.
the
guaranty
association
is
a
statutory
organization--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--yes.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
no.
i
think
it
is
well
settled
that
a
rehabilitation
proceeding
in
one
jurisdiction
can
alter
contractual
policy
rights
and
rights
against
the
general
assets
of
an
insurer,
and
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
affect
policyholders
in
other
jurisdictions.
that
is
well
settled.
but
what
is
not
at
all
settled
is
how
deposits
fit
into
this
scheme.
deposits
have
been...
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
state
law,
and
there
is
a
very
interesting
quote
from
this
court
as
to
the
status
of
deposits,
and
as
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
special
asset,
and
not
subject
to
reach
by
anyone
but
the
persons
for
whose
benefit
the
deposit
was
made.
this
court,
in
blake
v.
mcclung,
at
172
257,
and
this
is
quoted,
i
believe,
at
page
59...
page
29--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--pardon?
mr.
william
s.
patterson
yes,
i
suppose
it
would
have
been.
it
would
have
been
1898,
i
believe.
i
think
the
theory
behind
this
has
certainly
been
carried
through
into
certainly
more
recent
decisions.
this
court
stated,
"insurance
funds
set
apart
in
advance
for
the
benefit
of
hung
policyholders
of
a
foreign
insurance
company
doing
business
in
the
state
on
a
trust
fund
of
a
specific
kind
to
be
administered
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
certain
persons,
policyholders
in
other
states
know
that
those
particular
funds
are
segregated
from
the
mass
of
property
owned
by
the
company,
and
that
they
cannot
look
to
them
to
the
prejudice
of
those
for
whose
special
benefit
they
were
deposited.
"
that
is
exactly
the
theory
and
status
that
north
carolina
has
afforded
to
these
deposits,
that
it
is
a
trust
fund,
that
it
is
no
longer
owned
by
the
insolvent.
north
carolina
has
gathered
jurisdiction
into
itself
to
deal
with
this
deposit.
it
is
part
of
a
statutory
scheme.
their
interest...
the
state
interest,
of
course,
is
to
regulate
foreign
insurers
and
protect
north
carolina
policyholders
who
are
doing
business
against
foreign
insurers.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
since
it
wasn't
an
asset
of
the
insolvent
insurer,
it
wasn't
an
asset
before
the
rehabilitation
court.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct.
a
lot
has
been
said
here
about
the
general
jurisdictional
proposition
that
a
rehabilitation
court
in
one
state
can
adjudicate
rights
of
individuals
residing
in
another
state
even
though
those
individuals
are
not
necessarily
before
the
court.
i
don't
think
the
parties
disagree
with
that
at
all.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
i
think
it
attempted
to
litigate
it.
i
think
it
fell
short
of
the
mark.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
it
did
become
entered
before...
it
was
entered
before
the
north
carolina
judgment.
the
question
again
would
be,
can
the
indiana
rehabilitation
court
go
back
and
redo
its
prior
mistake
and
relate
that
back
to
the
insolvency
proceeding.
secondly,
in
attempting
to
do
so,
did
it
fully
and
fairly
consider
jurisdiction
the
second
time?
we
think
not.
i
think
if--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
well,
we...
i
think
the
appropriate
move
here
would
have
been
to
have
initiated...
if
unac
wanted
to
attempt
to
adjudicate
these
rights
prior
to
its
final
order
of
rehabilitation,
then
an
ancillary
proceeding
in
north
carolina
would
have
been
appropriate.
this
would
not
have
been
a
burden
on
unac,
who
did
business
in,
i
believe,
40
some
states.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
only
four,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
again,
they
are,
were
then
and
probably
are
to
this
day
completely
unaware
that
unac
has
asserted
that
its
order
cut
off
rights
in
this...
in
the
deposit
made
in
their
state--
i
think
in
addition
to
the
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
there
are
certainly
other
jurisdictional
claims
here.
the
notice
issue,
i
think,
is
quite
significant.
could
the
indiana
rehabilitation
proceeding
assert
jurisdiction
over
the...
this
would
be
in
a
situation
in
which
it
might
otherwise
have
jurisdiction,
would
it
have
had
jurisdiction
because
of
its...
would
it
have
lost
jurisdiction
or
failed
to
assert
jurisdiction
because
of
its
failure
to
give
any
notice
of
the
existence
of
these
deposits
to
the
policyholders--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--well,
indiana
law,
i
think,
is
fairly
clear
that
to
adjudicate
rights
in
the
trust,
it
must
have
either
the
trust
assets
or
the
trustee
before
it.
here
it
had
neither.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
well,
assuming
it
fully
and
fairly
considered
jurisdiction,
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
issue
here
would
be...
in
a
collateral
procedure,
i
think
the
relevant
inquiry
is,
was
jurisdiction
fully
and
fairly
considered,
not
whether
the
indiana
court
actually
had
jurisdiction.
conceivably,
indiana
could
have
fully
and
fairly
considered
jurisdiction
and
incorrectly
asserted
it,
and
north
carolina
would
have
been
foreclosed,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
there
was
no
consideration
of
jurisdiction
at
all.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
the
interest
on
the
bond
is
currently
being
accumulated
by
the
trustee.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
at
that
point,
the
interest
was
being
collected
and
paid
over
to
unac.
however,
it
was...
unac
or
the
department
of
insurance
had
the
right
to
stop
these
payments
at
any
time,
and
did
so.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
it
was...
i
think
it
started
being
accumulated...
well,
within
a
few
years--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--i
think
it
was
actually
within
few
years
by
virtue
of
oversight.
it
was
just--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--yes.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
it
didn't
file
a
claim
per
se.
what
happened
is,
the
original
draft
of
the
plan
of
rehabilitation
contemplated
certain
future
recoveries
by
the
rehabilitation
court.
i
think
unac
had
several
outstanding
suits
at
that
time,
so
there
was
a
possibility
of
future
recovery.
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
did
not...
said
that
any
of
these
future
recoveries
would
go
to
the
policyholder
regardless
of
whether
the
guaranty
association
had
taken
their
place.
the
guaranty
association
came
in
and
said,
if
we
are
going
to
make
the
policyholder
whole,
then
any
of
these
future
benefits
should
flow
back
to
the
guaranty
association.
that
was
its
only
claim
in
the...
in
the
rehabilitation
proceeding.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
well,
i
think
if
the...
the
trustee
would
certainly
be
empowered
to
accumulate
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
policyholders.
this
would
be
particularly--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--i
think
he
should
continue
to
accumulate
the
interest.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
if
there
were
no
claims,
i
don't
think
there
is
that
much
justification
for
doing
it,
but--
mr.
william
s.
patterson
--justice
stevens,
if
past
practice
of
the
department
were
followed,
the
interest
would
begin
to
be
paid
again
to
unac.
mr.
william
s.
patterson
in
addition
to
being
an
income...
or
a
contingent
beneficiary,
i
suppose
it
would
be
fair
to
also
characterize
unac
as
a
contingent
income
beneficiary
as
well
as
a
contingent
remaindermen
in
the
trust.
thank
you.
