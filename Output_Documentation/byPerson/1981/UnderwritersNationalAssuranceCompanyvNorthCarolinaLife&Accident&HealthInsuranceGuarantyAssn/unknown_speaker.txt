unknown
speaker
if
one
had
opted
out,
would
we
have
a
different
situation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
in
one
of
the
two
indiana
actions,
some
of
the
north
carolina
parties'
action
intervened,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
is
that
the
group
that
has
an
appeal
pending
in
the
indiana
courts?
unknown
speaker
from
which
of
the
judgments,
the
rehabilitation--
unknown
speaker
--the
second?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
basic
one,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
supplemental.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
status
of
that
appeal
now?
unknown
speaker
until
this
court
decides.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
never
any
appeal
from
the
1976--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
boehm,
did
that
occur
after
the
proceeding
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
so
which
takes
precedence--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
litigation
of
the
jurisdictional
question?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
was
fully
litigated
in
the
indiana
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
does
the
indiana
statutory
scheme
provide
for
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
proceedings
leading
to
rehabilitation?
unknown
speaker
yes.
the
ultimate
rehabilitation
decree
is
a
judicial
decree.
unknown
speaker
including
the
custodian
of
this
north
carolina
fund?
unknown
speaker
is
this
not
in
effect
a
streamlined
statutory
receivership,
much
like
an
old-fashioned
receivership?
unknown
speaker
it
merely
is
tailored
to
fit
the
particular
industry
here.
unknown
speaker
did
the
insurance
commissioner
of
north
carolina
take
any
part
in
the
indiana
case?
unknown
speaker
you
said
he
did
receive
notice.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
you
said
the
treasurer
of
north
carolina,
in
whose
name
the
bonds
were
registered,
took
no
part
either.
unknown
speaker
and
both
of
those
officers
are
parties
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
boehm,
i
gather,
of
course,
the
indiana
court
took
the
position
that
this
fund,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
the
deposit
was
before
it.
unknown
speaker
right.
justice
brennan,
what
was
before
it
was
the
beneficial
interest
of
unac
in
the
fund.
in
other
words,
this...
the
indiana
courts
did
not
adjudicate
the
trust,
if
you
want
to
use
the
parlance
of
the
north
carolina
parties,
was
invalid.
it
adjudicated,
to
use
the
trust
analogy,
that
the
beneficiaries
had
assigned
their
interest
to
unac
in
exchange
for
ongoing
insurance.
and
is
that
the
holding
of
the
indiana
rehabilitation
court?
unknown
speaker
how
did
it
say
the
deposit
or
the
interest
in
the
deposit
got
before
it?
unknown
speaker
was
that
resisted?
was
that
issue
contested
in
the
indiana
court?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
as
you
said,
the
north
carolina
authorities
never
appeared.
unknown
speaker
but
neither
resisted
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
insistence
that
the
equitable
interest
belonged--
unknown
speaker
--well,
didn't
the
policyholders
appear
only
through
the
association?
i
mean,
no
policyholders
were
there
in
person.
unknown
speaker
through
their
attorneys?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
no
north
carolina
policyholder
was
there--
unknown
speaker
--except
to
the
extent
that
they
had
assigned
their
claims
by
operation
of
law
to
the
association.
unknown
speaker
well,
only
through
the
association.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
that
is
your
fall-back
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
you
were
there
only
because
they
were
parties
to
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
ought
to
be
glad
you
don't
have
to
argue
that.
unknown
speaker
because
you
certainly
can
argue
that
they
were
there
through
the
association.
unknown
speaker
you
only
need
to
win
on
one,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
does
that
position
depend
on
north
carolina
law?
unknown
speaker
indiana
decides
as
to
who
has
possession
of
that
money
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
see
how
indiana
courts
got
jurisdiction
over
the
money
in
north
carolina.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
they
get...
is
that
a
north
carolina
claim?
unknown
speaker
is
that
determined
by
north
carolina
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
indiana
law
apply
to
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
you
are
trying
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
when
this
case
is
over
and
you
win,
and
north
carolina
says,
come
and
get
it.
unknown
speaker
how
could
you
get
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
am
i
talking
about
then
if
the
money
is
not
involved?
unknown
speaker
is
the
money
what
is
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
if
not,
where
do
we
get
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
if
not,
where
do
we
get
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
if
money
is
not
what
is
involved,
how
does
this
court
get
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
it
isn't
in
dispute
as
to
money
and
money.
unknown
speaker
okay.
all
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
boehm,
i
gather...
or
is
it
your
position
that
because
you
had
those...
or
indiana
courts,
rather,
had
the
guaranty
association
before
it,
it
had
that
jurisdiction.
even
if
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
fund
itself,
nevertheless
the
indiana
court
may
enforce
its
order
requiring
that
the
fund
be
part
of
the
assets.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
have
some
old
receivership
cases
that
said
that
the
receivership
court
could
adjudicate
the
claims
to
assets
outside
the
state
if
no
one
who
has...
who
had
any
claim
to
those
assets
appeared
in
the
receivership
court?
that
is
what
you
are
essentially
saying.
unknown
speaker
that
this
rehabilitation
proceeding
could
adjudicate
claims
to
property
in
north
carolina
even
though
the
people
who
also
had
claims
to
that
property
never
appeared
in
the
receivership
proceeding?
that
seems
to
be
your
basic
position.
unknown
speaker
and
yet...
i
don't
know.
must
you
win
on
this
ground?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
can
win
on
the
ground
that
the
policyholders
are
there
through
the
association.
unknown
speaker
and
that
they...
and
that
they
had
a
chance
to
litigate
everything
they
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
on
behalf
of
the
shareholder.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
the
policyholders
weren't
there,
doesn't
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
assuming
that
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
indiana
courts,
require
north
carolina
to
recognize
the
indiana
decree?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
that
is
if
it
is
bound
by
the
jurisdictional
holding,
but
who
is
bound
by
a
jurisdictional
determination
if
he
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
litigate
it?
unknown
speaker
and
who
litigated
it
in
indiana?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
there
is
it,
and
there
are
the
shareholders,
the
policyholders,
and
they
are
there
litigating
jurisdiction,
or
at
least
they
had
a
chance
to.
unknown
speaker
if
the
question
of
jurisdiction
had
never
come
up
in
the
indiana
court
and
the
policyholders
weren't
there,
they
had
never
had
a
chance
to
litigate
it
except
from
way
back
in
north
carolina,
just
the
recitation
of
having
jurisdiction
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--would
it,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
litigated.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
said
assume
they
weren't
there
through
the
association.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
i
want
you
to
assume
that
they
were
not
there.
unknown
speaker
but
not
with
respect
to
their
claims
against
property
in
north
carolina.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
either
they
were
there
through
the
association
or
they
weren't.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
certainly
have
a
simple
claim
at
the
front
end
of
your--
unknown
speaker
--it
may
be
right
or
wrong,
but
i
don't
know
why
we
have
to
try
to
settle
all
of
your
problems
that
you
have
all
around
the
united
states.
what
would
be
the
situation
if
this
were
in
a
bankruptcy
framework,
traditional
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
was
a
creditor
in
north
carolina,
your
insurance
company,
and
that
that
creditor
had,
let's
say
had
a
mortgage
on
north
carolina
property
or
he
had
a
north
carolina
judgment
that
gave
him
a
lien
on
north
carolina
property.
is
it
your
position
that
the
indiana
court,
without
the
presence
of
either
the
rece
or
the
creditor
could
have
wiped
it
out
or
adjusted
it,
taken
the
property
away
and
given
him
a
general
claim?
just
by
sending
him
notice
and
say,
show
up
or
else?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
an
old-fashioned
receiver
could
do
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
that
is
where
it...
the
indiana
law
can
take
away
the
rights
of
the
north
carolina
policyholders.
unknown
speaker
you
see,
that
is
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
he
shouldn't
buy
insurance
in
an
out
of
state
company
if
he
doesn't
want
to
take
that
risk.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
why
does
your
company
want
to
sell
in
north
carolina
if
it
doesn't
accept
the
north
carolina
law
requiring
it
to
make
deposits?
unknown
speaker
how
did
he
say
that?
unknown
speaker
and
you
take
his
assent
from
silence?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's
like
in
default,
if
you
don't
answer
a
complaint
in
a
lawsuit,
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
assent
to
whatever
default
judgment
may
be
entered,
do
you
not.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
so
in
an
ordinary
contract
suit,
if
the
defendant
happens
to
be
out
of
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
do
you
make
anything
of
mccarren-ferguson
in
respect
of
the
authority
of
the
indiana
insurance
commissioner?
unknown
speaker
that
still
doesn't
eliminate
the
full
faith
and
credit
federal
constitutional
question
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
federal
tribunal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
could
you
help
me
with
a
simple
factual
question
here?
would
you
tell
me
what
happens
to
the
$100,000
bond
in
north
carolina
if
you
win
and
what
happens
if
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
what
happens
to
policyholders
and
to
your
opponent.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
the
bond
stays
there,
but
what
happens
to...
how
much
difference
does
it
make
in
terms
of
dollars
to
policyholders?
what
is
happening
to
the
policyholders?
there
are
only
about
a
dozen
of
them,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
that
if
your
opponent
is...
it
is
the
guaranty
association
that
gets
the
benefit
of
your
defeat,
if
at
all.
unknown
speaker
now,
just
exactly
what
does
it
get?
does
that
help
it
pay
premiums,
or
help
it
pay
claims?
unknown
speaker
and
it
does
business
in
states
other
than
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not?
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
the
policy...
the
17
or
18
policyholders
in
north
carolina
have
no
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
and
what
additional
burden
has
the
indiana
rehabilitation
proceeding
put
on
the
guaranty
association?
what
obligation
do
they
have
that
they
did
not
otherwise
have?
unknown
speaker
they
are
basically
a
reinsurer.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
before
the
guaranty
fund
was
created,
the
policyholders
would
have
had
a
very
serious
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
case,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
is
the
position
on
the
north
carolina
officials
in
this
litigation
different
from
anyone
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
boehm,
the
treasurer
did
not
receive
notice.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
in
any
event--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
your
position
that
his
interest
is
not
such
that
he
requires
notice?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
the
state--
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
your
client
knew
about
it,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
schedule
it
as
an
asset
in
their
balance
sheet,
whatever
it
was?
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
is
it
your
position
that
the
proposed
final
plan
for
rehabilitation
and
the
first
final
judgment
did
not
in
any
way
indicate
to
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association
that
unac
was
assuming
and
the
indiana
court
was
assuming
that
it
had
control
in
effect
over
that
deposit?
unknown
speaker
but
north
carolina
can't
determine
for
itself,
can
it,
whether
or
not
indiana
has
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
rece
or
a
particular
set
of
facts,
or
a
particular
case?
that
remains
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
international
shoe
and
that
type
of
case?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
at
least
the
second
indiana
judgment,
remaining
unreversed
as
it
is,
an
official
act
or
entry
subject
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
even
though
it
may
not
be
final
in
indiana?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
assumption
that
a
judicial
decree
of
any
state
or
federal
court
presumptively
had
jurisdiction,
and
it
is
up
to
the
person
attacking
it
to
show
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather,
mr.
patterson,
that
is
that
the
nature
of
this
trust
was
such
that
that
deposit
could
never
be
an
asset
of
unac
in
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
unless
what?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
not
property
of
unac
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
really
fair?
supposing
all
the
policyholders...
there
are
only
17
policyholders
in
north
carolina?
supposing
they
all
accepted
a
liquidation
of
their
claims.
they
had
a
choice
of
either
to
keep
the
policies
in
effect
at
a
different
basis
or
liquidate.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
supposing
they
liquidated,
and
the
total
cost
of
liquidation
were
less
than
the
face
value
of
this
bond.
is
it
not
true
that
the
remainder
of
the
bond
would
have
reverted
to
the
general
assets
of
the
company?
unknown
speaker
assume
they
cease
doing
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
agree
that
the
association
was
the
assignee
of
the
policyholders'
interests?
unknown
speaker
under
north
carolina
law?
unknown
speaker
and
don't
you
agree
that
the
association
did
appear
in
the
indiana
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
the
plan
that
it
either
agreed
to
or
was
subject
to
there,
didn't
it
define
the
extent
of
its
interests?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
the
guaranty
association
accept
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
the
extent
of
it?
unknown
speaker
so
any
policyholder's
interest
in
this
fund,
the
association
had.
unknown
speaker
and
they
accepted
something
else
in
exchange
for
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
policyholders
are
out,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
exactly,
so
we
can
just
forget
about
them.
their
only
interest,
if
they
have
any,
is
in
the
association.
unknown
speaker
and
the
association
accepted
a
plan
which
defined
fully
the
extent
of
its
interests.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
they...
suppose
it
had
been
just
as
express
as
it
could
possibly
be
in
the
plan
that
not
only...
they
would
put
a
footnote,
and
you
also,
mr.
association,
release
any
claim
you
have
to
the
fund
in
north
carolina.
suppose
the
plan
had
just
said
that,
in
just
plain
black
and
white,
and
they
accepted
it.
do
you
think
the
association
would
be
permitted
under
those
circumstances
nevertheless
to
say,
we
still
own
the
fund
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
law.
and
in
those
circumstances,
in
those
circumstances
it
is
claimed
that
the
judgment
of
the
indiana
court
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
because
the
association
certainly
had
a
chance
to
say,
we
have
a
claim
to
this
fund,
but
they
didn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
they
gave
up
any
claim
they
had.
they
accepted
the
plan
in
full
satisfaction
of
any
claim
they
had,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
gets
back
to
what
you
answered
me
earlier,
doesn't
it,
mr.
patterson,
that
this
fund
simply
never
can
be
and
never
was
under
any
circumstances
part
of
the
assets
of
unac.
unknown
speaker
it
never
was,
i
think,
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
people
who
own
the
claims
to
the
fund,
who
were
the
beneficiaries
of
the
fund,
the
policyholders,
had
given
their
interest
to
the
association,
you
say
the
association
was
powerless
to
surrender
its
interest
in
the
fund
in
indiana
litigation?
that
sounds
strange.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
association
had
employed
a
driver
to
drive
an
automobile
to
st.
louis
to
attend
an
insurance
convention,
and
drove
through
indiana,
and
was
involved
in
an
accident,
and
indiana
sought
to
exert
long
arm
jurisdiction
over
the
association.
would
you
say
that
the
assets
of
the
fund
were
not
available
to
satisfy
any
judgment
if
a
long
arm
jurisdiction
were
proffered--
unknown
speaker
--any
judgment
against
the
north
carolina
association.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
saying
somehow
that
this
fund
can
never
be
reached,
no
matter
what
the
north
carolina
association
does,
and
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
if
the
north
carolina
association
engages
in
perhaps
ventures
that
it
may
not
be
empowered
to
do
under
state
law,
of
those
ventures
have
an
effect
in
another
state,
and
the
other
state
can
get
jurisdiction
over
the
association
by
a
long
arm
statute,
the
fund
may
be
an
asset
which
can
be
used
to
satisfy
a
judgment
rendered
in
those
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
i
am
laboring
under
a
misapprehension,
just
what
is
this
trust?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
in
effect
north
carolina
is
a
law
unto
itself
regardless
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
with
respect
to
this
particular
matter?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
north
carolina...
if
the
indiana
court
did
purport
to
do
that,
and
did
it
wrongly,
wasn't
the
north
carolina
association's
remedy
by
appeal
through
the
indiana
courts
rather
than
collateral
attack?
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson--
--what
is
the
issue--
--excuse
me.
go
ahead.
what
is
the
issue
before
the
indiana
supreme
court
on
the
guaranty
association's
appeal?
unknown
speaker
they
are
arguing
you
had
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
over
this
particular
deposit,
just
as
you
are
arguing
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
how
the
fund
may
be
used.
as
i
understand
it,
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
has
modified
the
rights
of
the
policyholders
so
that,
to
take
an
example,
a
claim
for
a
$1,000
injury
before
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
might
now
only
be
worth
$700.
all
right.
now,
if
such
a
claim
is
made
arising
out
of
an
incident
that
occurs
after
the
plan
had
been
approved,
would
it
be
your
view
that
the
policyholder
just
has
the
$700
entitlement,
in
my
hypothetical
example?
and
doesn't
that
in
turn
mean
that
the
likelihood
that
the
fund
may
be
exhausted
has
changed
because
the
obligations
that
it
might
have
to
satisfy
have
been
reduced?
so,
inevitably,
has
not
the
possibility
that
that
fund
will
be
used
in
certain
ways
have
been
changed
by
what
happened
in
indiana?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did...
in
this
case,
i
thought
everyone
agreed
that
the
rights
of
the
north
carolina
policyholders
are
less
than
they
were
before,
which
in
turn
means
that
their
right
to
recover
from
the
fund
is
different.
in
the
event
that...
say
your
client
is
bankrupt.
now
they
would
get
from
the
state
the
$100,000
on
deposit
in
north
carolina,
they
would
only
get
$700
instead
of
$1,000.
unknown
speaker
so
that
isn't
it
inevitably
true--
--but
they
get
that
from
the
association.
unknown
speaker
and
as
long
as
the
association
can
do
it,
there
will
be
no
need
to
resort
to
the
bond.
unknown
speaker
so
the
bond
is
only
important
to
the
policyholders
in
the
event
that
the
reinsurer
is
also
insolvent.
unknown
speaker
well,
only
in
the
event
that
it
can't
perform
its
statutory
duty,
then.
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
need
to
resort
to
the
bond,
and
you
would
have
a
lesser
claim
against
the
bond
because
the
policyholders
there
have
received...
have
a
different
bargain
than
they
had
before
the
indiana
proceeding
went
forward.
you
don't
challenge
the
power
of
the
indiana
court
to
modify
the
kind
of
claim
the
policyholder
can
make
against
that
bond.
unknown
speaker
that
was
decided
while
poll
and
virginia
was
still
law?
unknown
speaker
decided
while
poll
and
virginia
was
still
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
is
it
your
position
that
the
indiana
court
could
not
at
any
time
litigate
the
question
of
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
insofar
as
the
deposit
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
the
indiana
court
in
your
view
could
not
even
deal
with
the
question
in
its
courts
of
jurisdiction.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
would
concede
that
the
indiana
court
had
general
jurisdiction
over
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
and
over
all
of
the
policyholders
for
whose
benefit
the
north
carolina
fund
was
held?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
the
indiana
court
in
the
second
proceeding
did
at
least
attempt
to
litigate
this
very
question?
unknown
speaker
and
did
that
judgment
become
entered
before
the
north
carolina
judgment
was
entered?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
even
if
it
tried
to,
it
couldn't
ever.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
how
can
a
rehabilitation
proceeding
in
these
complicated
insurance
matters
ever
do
the
job
if
the
court
asserting
jurisdiction
can't
deal
with
these
questions
of
the
deposits?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
there
were
other
states
with
similar
special
fund
deposits.
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
they
did
not
make
similar
claims
such
as
north
carolin?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
patterson,
you
refer
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
a
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction
of
a
state.
don't
they
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
all
matters
that
are
brought
before
them,
unless
excluded
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
they
sit?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
the
indiana
court
made
a
wrong
decision.
it
still
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
unless
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
may
i
ask
you
another
factual
question?
who
got
the
interest
on
this
bond,
the
$100,000?
unknown
speaker
what
happened
between
1973
and
the
beginning
of
the
rehabilitation?
unknown
speaker
right.
and
then
after
the
rehabilitation
proceeding
started,
what
happened
to
the
interest
then?
was
it
accumulated
right
away,
or
was
it
continued
to
be
paid
for
a
period?
unknown
speaker
within
a
few
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happened
during
the
oversight
period?
where
did
it
go
then?
did
it
go
to
the
rehabilitation
trustee?
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
did
the
guaranty
association
file
a
claim
in
the
proceeding
in
indiana,
and
if
so,
what
did
it
claim?
did
it
file
a
claim
as
a
contingent
creditor?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
interest?
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
proper
disposition
of
that
interest
today?
unknown
speaker
not
what
he
is
empowered
to
do.
what
is
your
position
as
to
what
he
should
do?
unknown
speaker
he
should
accumulate
the
interest
indefinitely,
even
if
there
are
no
claims
on
the
fund.
unknown
speaker
but
then
who
should
get
it,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
to
the
insurance
company.
unknown
speaker
can't
north
carolina
tell
you
to
redeposit
the
$100,000
tomorrow?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
what...
it
seems
to
me
it
is
going
to
be
there
no
matter
who
wins.
that
is
what
puzzles
me.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
would
have
to
make
another
deposit,
if
you
wanted
to
write
insurance
in
north
carolina.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
is
really
at
stake,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
time
when
some
insurance
companies
declined
to
do
business
in
certain
states,
notably
texas,
for
reasons
of
that
kind.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boehm,
i
just
didn't
really
have
a
clear
enough
grasp
of
the
facts
here.
is
the
reason
they
claim
they
are
entitled
to
the
$100,000
because
there
has
been
that
much
in
defaults
subsequent
to
this
plan?
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
are
claiming
it
on
account
of
default
pre-rehabilitation--
unknown
speaker
--defaults,
but
i
thought
the
policyholders
had
accepted
the
new
plan,
so
i
don't
understand
what...
what
are
the
defaults
on
which
they
want
this--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
boehm,
i
thought
the
funds
were
to
be
used
to
pay
the
increased
premium
charges
that
arose
out
of
the
rehabilitation.
unknown
speaker
and
the
premiums
have
gone
up.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
the
north
carolina
guaranty
association
hoping
to
reach
the
deposit
to
repay
itself--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
increased
cost
of
the
premiums?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
we
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
that
is
part
of
the--
--and
the
benefits
have
gone
down.
there
are
two
changes,
basically.
and
so
it
is
a
rather
complicated
actuarial
proposition.
mr.
boehm,
don't
other
states
have
laws
similar
to
north
carolina's--
unknown
speaker
--concerning
these
deposits?
unknown
speaker
are
they
identical
in
fact?
unknown
speaker
do
most
states
have
laws
that
are
similar?
unknown
speaker
has
the
north
carolina
court
yet
held
that
if
you
lose
in
this
proceeding,
that
your
opponent
is
entitled
to
use
the
bond
to
reimburse
itself
for
the
increased
premium?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
you
think
the
appellate
court
approved
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
frankly,
i
didn't
get
that
out
of
the
appellate
court
opinion.
that
is
one
reason--
unknown
speaker
--well,
was
that
order
affirmed
by
the
appellate
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
usually
what
it
means,
then,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
we
often
say
around
here
it
is
judgments
we
review
not
opinions.
