justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
question
is
whether
a
public
defender
acts
under
color
of
state
law
while
representing
an
indigent
defendant
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
respondent,
dodson
was
represented
on
his
appeal
from
a
state
criminal
conviction
by
martha
shepard.
she
was
a
lawyer
employed
fulltime
in
the
public
defendant’s
office
maintained
by
polk
in
county,
iowa.
dodson
claimed
that
shepard
have
failed
to
represent
him
adequately.
to
maintain
his
case
under
42
u.s.c.
1983,
the
plaintiff
must
allege
that
he
was
harmed
by
action
occurring
under
color
of
state
law,
the
criteria
for
identifying
such
action
which
stated
the
--
in
a
decision
of
this
court
called
united
states
against
classic.
that
case
establishes
that
a
person
acts
under
color
of
state
law
only
when
exercising
power
and
here
i
quote,
“possessed
by
virtue
of
state
law
and
made
possible
only
because
the
wrongdoer
is
clothed
with
the
authority
of
state
law.”
the
court
of
appeals
relying
on
the
fact
that
shepard
was
employed
and
paid
by
the
state
found
there
was
action
under
color
of
state
law.
we
think
however,
the
fact
that
a
public
defender
is
paid
by
the
state
is
not
controlling
from
the
time
of
her
assignment
to
represent
dodson.
shephard
assumed
the
functions
of
any
other
defense
lawyer.
traditionally,
the
relationship
between
lawyer
and
client
is
a
private
one.
in
representing
in
one
accused
crime,
the
loyalty
of
a
public
defender
is
solely
to
his
or
her
client.
the
role
of
a
public
defendant
is
adversarial
to
the
state.
the
public
defender
opposes
the
prosecution
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
court,
objects
when
proper
to
state
evidence
and
defends
the
rights
of
his
client.
there
is
no
color
of
state
law
in
these
activities.
for
these
reasons
we
reversed
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
blackman
has
filed
a
dissent.
