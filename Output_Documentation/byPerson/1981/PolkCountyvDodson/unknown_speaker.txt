unknown
speaker
did
the
eighth
circuit
intimate
any
view
as
to
whether
a
non-indigent
defendant
suing
his
privately
licensed
counsel
whom
he
had
chosen
would
be
liable
under
1983
because
the
state
had
licensed
him
as
a
member
of
the
bar?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
would
follow
fairly
naturally
from
this
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
never
understood
it
to
be
the
law,
either,
but
i
have
never
understood
the
eighth
circuit's
holding
to
be
the
law.
unknown
speaker
subject
to
suit
for
his
actions.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
a
private
attorney
appointed
by
the
state
wouldn't
act
under
color
of
state
law,
and
certainly
if
that
were
true,
a
private...
an
attorney
employed
privately
wouldn't,
either,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
so?
at
least...
don't
they
have
authority
in
the
eighth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
an
appointed
attorney,
a
private
attorney
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
an
indigent
defendant
does
not
act
under
color
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
in
the
eighth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
i
would
suppose...
wouldn't
it
be
a
fortiori
that
a
private
attorney
wouldn't
be
subject
to
a
1983?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
prosecutor?
is
he
subject?
unknown
speaker
he
has
got
absolute
liability.
how
about
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect
does
a
public
defender
serving
in
this
capacity
as
part
of
one
of
the
three
legs
of
the
stool,
the
judge,
the
prosecutor,
the
defense
counsel,
in
what
respect
is
he
different
from
the
others
in
performing
the
broad
social
function
and
constitutional
function
of
providing
counsel?
unknown
speaker
that
was
in
a
malpractice
suit,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
real
difference
that
he
represents
the
defendant,
period,
and
nobody
else?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
but
is
he
required
to
be?
unknown
speaker
he
is
not
really
employed.
he
is
paid
by
the
state.
he
is
not
employed
by
the
state.
isn't
there
a
difference
there?
i
mean,
when
somebody
is
employed
by
somebody,
he
is
under
the
control
of
that
person,
but
is
the
defender
here
under
the
control
of
the
state
at
all,
once
he
is
appointed?
unknown
speaker
is
he
in
any
difference
posture
professionally...
i
emphasize
professionally...
from
a
psychiatrist
at
the
state
mental
hospital
for
indigents,
or
a
surgeon
at
a
hospital
provided...
which
provides
services
for
indigents?
in
each
case,
he
is
to
function
as
a
professional
carrying
out
his
professional
duty.
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
in
what
sense
is
it
not
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
held
in
o'connor
have
we
not,
that
the
medical
director
of
a
mental
hospital
does...
the
state
action
requirement
under
1983
is
satisfied,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
haven't
cited
o'connor
in
your
briefs,
or
in
your
reply
brief,
but
respondent
relies
on
it
rather
heavily.
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
we
hold
that
in
o'connor
add
donaldson?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
did,
we
certainly
did,
and
we
allowed
liability,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
difference
between
a
doctor-patient
relationship
and
the
attorney-client
i
relationship?
is
there
any?
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
you
say
the
same
thing
here,
that
a
public
defender
is
satisfying
the
state's
obligation
to
protect
indigents?
unknown
speaker
but
when
a
psychiatrist
in
a
state
hospital
examines
a
defendant
who
is
charged
with
a
crime,
he
may
be
performing
functions
which
in
the
end
result
are
directly
contrary
to
the
prosecutor's,
the
state's
right
as
asserted
by
the
prosecutor
to
convict
him,
because
the
psychiatrist
may
come
out
with
the
conclusion
that
he
is
incapable
of
forming
the
necessary
intent,
and
therefore
in
effect
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
is
there
any
difference
between
that
conflict
and
the
attorney's
conflict
with
the
prosecutor
in
the
adversary
system?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
of
the
key
figures
in
that
process
that
you
have
described,
denying
him
his
liberty,
is
the
prosecutor,
and
we
extend
to
the
prosecutor
an
absolute
immunity.
this
goes
back
to
my
earlier
question
to
you.
in
broad
social
and
constitutional
terms,
how
is
the
defense
counsel
performing
any
different
function
from
the
prosecutor?
unknown
speaker
and
constitutional
sense.
unknown
speaker
also
a
constitutional
sense,
under
gideon
and
argensinger.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
each
is
engaged
in
administering
justice,
each
with
a
different
role.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
respect,
the
appointed
counsel
or
the
retained
one
doesn't
differ,
does
he,
from
the
public
defender?
unknown
speaker
and
they
treat
them
separately,
apparently,
for
purposes
of
1983.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
treat
them
separately.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jesse,
this
court
hasn't
really
decided,
though,
has
it,
whether
court-appointed
private
counsel
are
said
to
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law
for
purposes
of
section
1983.
the
ferri
case
really
didn't
decide
that,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
also,
how
do
you
get
around
such
cases
as
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority
in
deciding
when
the
state,
and
in
this
case
the
county,
or
a
county
official,
or
a
public
defender
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
where
a
private
restaurant
was
held
to
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law
simply
because
it
had
leased
the
space
from
the
state?
that
was
sufficient.
now,
how
do
you
get
around
cases
like
that?
unknown
speaker
apply
a
function
test,
in
other
words,--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
jesse,
is
the
prosecutor
of
polk
county
elected?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
lawyer
is
appointed
by
the
court
or
the
supervisors?
unknown
speaker
to
each
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
come
before
the
judge,
and
the
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
appoint
you
a
lawyer.
who
does
he
appoint?
unknown
speaker
office.
unknown
speaker
committed.
it
is
sort
of
a
committee?
unknown
speaker
and
the
supervisors
pay
him.
unknown
speaker
the
supervisors
pay
each
lawyer,
or
the
office?
unknown
speaker
and
they
get
paid
by
the
year?
unknown
speaker
you
see,
you
are
now
giving
me
trouble
about
his
individual
responsibility
to
the
individual
client
when
he
is
being
paid
by
the
year.
that
gives
me
a
little
problem.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
give
you
a
little
problem?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
see
a
difference
between
the
judge
saying,
i
will
appoint
lawyer
jones
to
defend
you,
and
the
judge
saying,
i
will
give
you
an
office
to
defend
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
does
the
defendant
look
to
for
service,
the
office
or
an
individual?
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
court.
but
the
court
does
not
give
him
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
i
still
have
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
haven't
even
decided
that,
have
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jesse,
may
i
ask--
--well,
if
you
decided
you
were
in
trouble
now,
you
might
be
in
trouble
then,
under
the
other
system,
too.
and
isn't
it
true
that
if
we
decide,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
color
of
law
question,
that
we
need
not
reach
the
amenity
issue
at
all?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jesse,
when
the
district
judge
dismissed
this
complaint,
as
i
understand
the
papers,
he
forwarded
the
papers
to
the
iowa
supreme
court,
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
appeal
on
the
merits,
which
counsel
thought
was
without
merit.
do
you
know
if
the
iowa
supreme
court
ever
did
decide
the
appeal
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
then
in
this
case
the
district
judge
says,
after
everything
was
done,
he
forwarded
everything
to
the
chief
justice
of
the
iowa
supreme
court,
and
nothing
further
happened
as
far
as
we
know,
then.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson,
is
this
the
ground
on
which
you
distinguish,
or
do
you
distinguish
from
the
appointed
counsel?
unknown
speaker
on
this
ground?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
but
your
submission
also
is
that
the
appointed
counsel,
there
would
be
no
state
action
involved?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
my
question
really
is,
do
you
agree
with
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
so
that
issue
is
still
open,
you
suggest.
well,
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
the
court
there
that
the
prisoner
was
held
by
a
judgment
of
the
state
mandated
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
in
cuyler,
yes.
not
that
his
particular
attorney
had
performed
incompetently.
or
that
his
attorney
acted
under
color
of
law.
those
are
different
concepts,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
it
was
held
there
was
sufficient
state
action
to
set
aside
the
conviction?
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
in
any
event,
mr.
hudson,
you
don't
have
to
concede,
and
you
don't,
i
gather--
unknown
speaker
--the
answer
to
whether
or
not
the
privately
appointed
counsel
involves
state
action.
unknown
speaker
that
it
does
not
involve
state
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
holding
is
that
the
private
attorney
doesn't
act
under
color
of
law,
under
color
of
state
law.
that
is
the
way--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
it
isn't
a
question
of
state
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
referred
to
the
extensive
regulation
of
the
polk
county
public
defender.
certainly
the
iowa
bar
extensively
regulates
the
members
of
the
iowa
bar,
does
it
not?
even
though
they
might
be
privately
retained
to
defend
a
criminal
in
an
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
the
iowa
bar
have
the
right
to
define
champerty,
and
maintenance,
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
that
bar
associations
traditionally
define
as
violations
of
canons
of
ethics?
unknown
speaker
if
we
hold
that
the
defense
counsel
here
is
subject
to
the
same
rules
as
anybody
else,
and
that
he
is
liable
for
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
wouldn't
we
thereafter
be
obliged
to
give
him
the
same
immunity
we
give
the
prosecutor?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
so
that
everybody's
pocketbook
is
secure
except
defense
counsel.
unknown
speaker
he
is
not
usually
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
county.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
a
private
attorney
representing
a
criminal
defendant
on
appeal
concludes
that
the
case
is
utterly
frivolous,
what
is
his
duty?
a
private
attorney
now.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
before
we
come
back
to
the
appointed
counsel,
the
private
attorney,
as
you
suggested,
if
he
considered
it
was
frivolous,
would
have
the
duty,
i
suppose,
first
of
all
to
tell
the
client.
unknown
speaker
he
also
has
a
duty
to
the
court,
and
what
does
that
duty
to
the
court
embrace?
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you
think
there
is
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
between
the
privately
retained
counsel
and
the
public
defender,
who
reaches
the
same
conclusion,
that
the
appeal
is
utterly
frivolous.
unknown
speaker
my
assumption
is
that
you
find
no
legitimate
arguable
position.
you
have
a
duty
to
the
court,
i
would
think.
you
are
still
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
perhaps.
unknown
speaker
if
the
private
attorney,
knowing
the
appeal
was
frivolous,
did
nothing,
prosecuted
it,
and
then
sent
the
client
a
bill--
unknown
speaker
--i
am
sorry.
pursued
the
appeal.
a
private
attorney--
unknown
speaker
--concluded
the
appeal
was
frivolous,
did
not
advise
his
client,
went
ahead
and
argued
the
case,
lost
it,
of
course,
sent
the
client
a
bill.
would
that
be
malpractice?
unknown
speaker
it
sure
would.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
very
many
lawyers
today,
private
or
otherwise,
want
to
take
the
risk
of
not
pressing
every
claim
that
the
defendant
wants
him
to
press,
and
every
appeal
that
the
defendant
wants
pressed?
unknown
speaker
they
now
have
to
protect
their
flanks
from
their
own
client.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
the
prosecutor
totally
without
obligations
to
the
defendant,
the
accused
person?
unknown
speaker
well,
apart
from
that,
in
the
first
instance
the
prosecutor
certainly
has
a
professional
obligation
not
to
present
evidence
to
a
grand
jury
or
to
a
petit
jury
later
on
trial
which
he
does
not
regard
as
reliable.
that
is
one
of
the
canons.
he
has
an
obligation
not
to
seek
indictments
against
people
unless
there
is
a
solid
basis
for
it.
there
are
a
whole
range
of
obligations,
limited,
to
be
sure,
compared
with
the
defense
counsel,
but
he
is
obliged
to
do
certain
things
which
are
for
the
protection
of
the
accused,
or
the
putative
accused.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
defense
lawyer
who
knows
or
believes
his
client
is
about
to
lie
is
directed
by
the
standards
not
to
do
anything
to
help
him
other
than
letting
him
take
the
stand
and
tell
the
story
in
his
own
words.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
in
any
fraud
on
the
part--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
hudson,
in
this
case,
does
the
complaint
allege
that
the
lawyer,
ms.
shepard,
did
anything
other
than
what
a
competent
lawyer
would
do?
unknown
speaker
other
inconclusory
language?
she
apparently
filed
an
anders
brief
pursuant
to
rule
104,
and
had
the...
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
appeal
would
have
had
any
merit
had
it
not
been
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
there
is.
unknown
speaker
it
refers
to
the
eighth
amendment,
but
i
don't
think
you
would
contend
there
is
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
alleged.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
like
hundreds
i
have
seen,
that
the
main
reason
is,
he
was
convicted?
and
so,
the
only
way
he
can
be
convicted
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
isn't
that
what
it
adds
up
to?
unknown
speaker
i
have
seen
hundreds
of
them.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
if
there
is
merit
to
the
claim
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
is
not
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
his
release
from
prison?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
sort
of
strange
to
be
suing
for
damages
while
you
don't
even
challenge
in
the
appropriate
forum
the
conviction
that
keeps
you
there?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
there
is
no
challenge,
at
least
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
to
be
released,
and
to
have
the
lawyer
disbarred,
and
the
judge
said
he
wouldn't
do
either
of
those
things.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
litigation
over
the
quality
of
his
representation
is
premature
before
we
know
whether
he
is
entitled
to
his
release,
because
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
his
release,
he
has
suffered
no
damages.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
have
a
trial
on
this
complaint
without
first
having
a
trial
on
the
question,
first
exhausting
remedies
and
finding
out
whether
the
conviction
is
valid?
unknown
speaker
but
how
could,
in
a
trial
like
this...
maybe
that
is
true,
but
there
has
also
never
been
a
trial
to
my
knowledge
of
a
1983
case
against
a
defense
lawyer
while
the
defendant
is
still
sitting
in
jail.
it
just
seems
to
me
a
rather--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
a
strange
order
in
which
to
do
business.
unknown
speaker
because
how
would
you
compute
damages
if
you
figure
he
is
still
going
to
be
there?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
rather
clear
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
recover
damages
if
he
is
lawfully
incarcerated,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
in
order
for
him
to
prevail
on
the
merits
of
his
complaint,
he
must
prove
a
constitutional
violation,
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
can
prove
a
constitutional
violation,
a
fortiori,
his
conviction
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
there
are
no
damages
for
harmless
error.
that
is
perfectly
clear.
unknown
speaker
and
whether
the
complaint
has
alleged
a
cause
of
action.
i
am
just
wondering
whether
it
is
necessary
to
get
into
all
this
state
action
business
when
there
is
a
lawsuit
that
is
way,
way
ahead
of
schedule.
unknown
speaker
but
1983
provides
for
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
judge
perhaps
on
a
proper
motion
could
have
dismissed
this
case
on
the...
for
lack
of
an
allegation
of
the
cause
of
action,
because
of
the
lack
of
a
showing
that
he
is
improperly
incarcerated.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
reason
why
the
district
judge
could
not
act
on
that?
that
is
the
thrust
of
my
question.
unknown
speaker
yes,
on
the
very
grounds
that
have
just
been
under
discussion.
that
he
can't
make
out
a
case,
he
can't
make
out
a
case
until
some
court
has
determined
that
the
accused
is
unconstitutionally
confined
in
a
prison.
unknown
speaker
not
if
you
are
attacking...
not
if
you
are
attacking
your
custody.
unknown
speaker
what
was
he
sentenced
for?
unknown
speaker
for
how
long?
unknown
speaker
so
he
is
still
in
prison?
unknown
speaker
and
was
there
an
appeal
that
was
never
disposed
of?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
appeal,
was
the
question
of
adequacy
of
counsel
raised
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
lawsuit
doesn't
challenge
the
adequacy
of
representation
by
trial
counsel,
as
i
read
the
complaint.
it
just
challenges
adequacy
of
representation
by
appellate
counsel
for
filing
and
anders
brief.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
gist
of
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
he
was
asking
for
dismissal
under
rule
104--
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
united
states'
interest
in
this,
in
arguing
that
particular
question?
unknown
speaker
what
about
section
242
and
a
private
attorney,
privately
employed
attorney,
where
it
is
held
that
there
is
state
action
involved
if
he
misrepresents
the...
if
the
state
continues
to
hold
a
person
even
though
he
has
been
misrepresented
by...
or
badly
represented?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
have
to,
to
win
in
this
case,
you
have
to
show
that
the
conduct
of
the
public
defender
was
pursuant
to
some
rule
of
the
county?
unknown
speaker
you
just
have
to
prove
that
he
was
an
employee
of
the
county?
is
that
all?
unknown
speaker
and
just
given
the
general
duties
of
representing
indigents?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
be
incorrect
with
respect
to
the
privately
retained
counsel?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
just
say
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
taken
a
position
as
to
whether
section
242
would
be
applicable
to
a
privately
retained
counsel.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
you
rely
on
that
argument,
it
would
apply
to
appointed
counsel
as
well
as
the
public--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
it
true
that
in
your
criminal
prosecutions
that
raise
a
similar
issue
of
lawyers,
they
have
been
public
defenders
who
have
used
their
office
to
get
money
out
of
indigent
clients?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
a
clear
acting
under
color
of
state
law
in
a
way
that
is
quite
different
from
merely
performing
the
office
of
lawyer
in
an
incompetent
manner.
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
those
decisions
are
not
necessarily
implicated
by
what
we
do
with
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
if
defense
counsel
gets
a
man
acquitted,
that
helps
the
state.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
i
said.
i
said,
it
helps
the
state.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
presumption,
at
least,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
on
the
underlying
question
here,
at
least
as
i
see
one
of
the
underlying
questions?
what
if
a
privately
retained
lawyer
for
an
affluent
client
did
precisely
what
ms.
shepard
did
in
this
case?
would
there
be
any
problems
or
liabilities
or
whatever?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume,
not
the...
not
the
precise
conduct
here,
but
the
defense
counsel
privately
retained
by
an
affluent
client,
said
to
his
client,
you
have
no
case,
you
can't
get
anywhere
on
appeal,
and
i
won't
put
my
name
on
any
appeal
except
to
protect
you
by
filing
the
notice
of
appeal,
and
then
i
am
out,
you
get
yourself
another
lawyer.
any
problem
on
the
underlying
question
there?
unknown
speaker
on
whether
there
is
any
liability
as
between
them,
laying
aside
the
constitutional
question.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
lawyer
can't
withdraw
from
a
case?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
meant.
unknown
speaker
well,
classic
involved
the
whole
state
of
louisiana,
didn't
it?
