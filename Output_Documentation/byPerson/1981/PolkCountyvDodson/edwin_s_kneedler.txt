mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
address
the
question
whether
a
public
defender
employed
by
a
county
acts
under
color
of
state
law
within
the
meaning
of
42
united
states
code
section
1983,
in
the
course...
when
he
performs
his
official
duties
under
state
law
of
representing
indigent
defendants.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
issue
is
of
interest
to
the
united
states
because
the
language
in
section
1983
referring
to
color
of
law,
color
of
statute
is
the
precise
language,
is
parallel
to
the
language
in
section
242
of
title
18,
which
provides
criminal
sanctions
for
anyone
who
willfully
subjects
a
person
to
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
while
acting
under
color
of
law,
and
this
court
has
construed
the
color
of
law
language
in
section
242
to
be...
given
it
essentially
the
same
scope
as
the
color
of
law
language
in
title...
in
section
1983.
in
this
case,
the
principal
conduct
complained
of
by
respondent
was
the
alleged
failure
of
petitioner
shepard
to
adequately
represent
him
on
appeal
of
his
state
conviction.
respondent
further
alleges
that
this
inadequacy
was
due
to
or
pursuant
to
policies
adopted
by
the
offender
advocate
and
by...
apparently
by
the
board
of
supervisors
of
polk
county.
as
described
by
mr.
hudson,
the
county...
the
polk
county
offender
advocate's
office
is
established
pursuant
to
a
state
statute
that
calls
for
the
establishment
of
county
public
defenders's
offices.
in
this
case,
the
offender
advocate
was
appointed
by
the
board
of
supervisors,
is
entirely
funded
by
the
board
of
supervisors.
it
seems
clear,
then,
that
the
polk
county
offender
advocate's
office
is
an
agency
of
polk
county.
indeed,
the
chapter
of
the
iowa
code
that
authorizes
counties
to
establish
offender
advocates'
offices
is
entitled
county
and
township
government.
so,
acting
pursuant
to
the
state
statute,
the
county
has
established
an
office
of
county
government
for
the
purpose
of
providing
function...
defense
to
indigent
defendants.
moreover,
in
this
case,
the
conduct
complained
of
was
the
inadequacy
of
petitioner
shepard's
representation
of
respondent
on
appeal.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
iowa
statute
expressly
require
the
public
defender,
once
he
is
appointed,
to
represent...
to
defend
and
counsel
the
defendant,
and
to
represent
him
at
all
stages
of
his
subsequent
post-conviction
remedies,
including
appeal
or
other
remedies.
so,
in
this
case
the
county
employee
involved,
the
assistant
public
defender,
was
discharging
her
duties
under
county
ordinance
and
state
law
when
she
filed
the
anders
brief
or
the
alleged
anders
brief
that
respondent
complains
of.
it
would
seem
indisputable
that
a
state
employee,
or
the
actions
of
a
state
employee
undertaken
in
the
course
of
the
discharge
of
her
official
duties
under
state
law
is
properly
attributable
to
the
state,
and
therefore
would
be
state
action
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
given
this,
it
would
seem
equally
indisputable
that
those
same
actions
would
be
taken
under
color
of
state
law
for
purposes
of
section
1983,
which
was
passed
to
enforce
the
restraints
on
state
action
imposed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
indeed,
this
court
in
united
states
versus
price
said
that
in
cases
under
section
1983,
the
element
of
color
of
law
has
been
treated
as
the
same
thing
as
the
state
action
requirement
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
my
understanding
of
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
in
cuyler
versus
sullivan
was
that
the
state
action
there
involved
was
the
fact
that
the
state
had
deprived
the
defendant
of
his
liberty
pursuant
to
a
judgment
which
was
the
culmination
of
a
prosecution
initiated
by
the
state,
and
indeed
the
court
refers
to
the
act,
the
state
action
as
being
the
state's
obtaining
the
conviction,
which
is
tainted
by
the
conduct
of
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
i
would
like
to
follow
up
on
that
for
a
moment.
the
notion,
the
argument
that
petitioners
seek
to
advance
is
that
an
exception
should
be
carved
out
of
the
state
action,
or
the
color
of
law
principle,
because
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
that
is
entered
into
between
the
public
defender
and
the
indigent
defendant,
the
notion
being
that
it
is
somehow
antagonistic
to
the
state
when
the
public
defender
represents
the
indigent
defendant.
i
think
that
analysis
is
incorrect,
and
of
course--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
that
presents
quite
a
different
question.
i
think
the
reason
why
that
is
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
whether
there
would
be
color
of
state
law
for
anyone
in
this
case,
for
anyone
other
than
the
state
employed
public
defender.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
have
not
to
date.
that
issue
has
not
arisen.
but
i
would
point
out
one
distinction,
i
think,
that
is
important
in
cuyler,
that
might
suggest...
that
at
least
would
distinguish
it
from
this
case.
there
are
many
actions
or
at
least
some
actions
by
persons
who
everyone
would
concede
are
acting
wholly
in
a
private
capacity
which
could
nevertheless
render
a
conviction
invalid
and
unconstitutional,
for
instance,
someone
who
might
attempt
to
bribe
a
juror,
or
prejudicial
publicity
in
a
newspaper
might
render
a
trial...
a
conviction
invalid
under
the
constitution
because
it
deprived
the
defendant
his
right
to
a
fair
trial,
but
that
would
not
necessarily
render
the
private
person
acting
under
color
of
state
law
for
these
purposes.
but
this
case
can
be
decided
on
a
much
narrower
principle,
that
the
defense
counsel
here
was
concededly
an
employee
of
the
government.
what
i
was
referring
to
earlier
is
that
in
a
criminal
trial,
the
government
has
two
obligations,
or
two
duties.
one
is
the
duty
of
the
prosecution
to
conduct
a
fair
trial.
the
second
duty
that
evolves
from
the
court's
decisions
in
gideon
and
with
respect
to
appeals
from
anders,
is
to
provide
a
defense.
provide
for
the
defendant
to
have
a
defense
made
on
his
behalf.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
necessarily,
because
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
in
both
events,
the
lawyer
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
to
an
extent,
i
think
they...
to
an
extent,
i
think
they
are,
because
the
fact,
what
is
being...
what
is
being
discussed
in
this
case,
for
example,
is
conduct
that
is
at
the
very
core
of
the
person's
duties
under
state
law,
and
the
state
has
imposed
those
duties,
the
relevant
provisions
of
iowa
law
expressly
require
as
would
seem
implicit
in
the
creation
of
the
public
defender's
office,
for
the
public
defender
to
represent
the
defendant.
so,
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
performing
his
duty
to
his
client,
he
is
at
the
same
time
performing
a
duty...
fulfilling
his
duty
to
the
state
in
the
creation
of
the
public
defender's
office,
so
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
saying
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
the
interests
of
justice
are
served
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
sir,
it
helps
the
state
in
the
broadest
sense,
i
would
suppose,
in
seeing
that
justice
is
done,
but
here
referring
to
the
state
as
the
government,
the
state
would
have
been
fulfilling
its
obligation
of
providing
defense
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
suppose
that...
of
course,
this
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
rather
than
whether
the
counsel
had
acted
under
color
of
state
law,
but
that,
i
think,
would
go
back
to
the
theory
of
anders,
whether...
the
obligation
of
counsel
to
file
an
anders
brief,
and
that
has
been...
that
could
either
be
a
due
process
right,
in
which
case
it
would
apply
to
private
counsel,
or
an
equal
protection
right
ensuring
indigent
clients
the
same
rights,
and
in
that
case
it
may
not.
so
i
think
it
would
depend
on
one's
view
of
the
theory
of
anders
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
whether
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
liability
exposure
under
state
malpractice
law,
depending
on--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
he
could
withdraw,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
am
sorry.
yes.
no,
if
he
withdrew,
i
would...
whether
or
not
the
constitution
requires
it,
it
would
certainly
be
proper
to
follow
the
same
type
of
procedure
as
in
anders.
