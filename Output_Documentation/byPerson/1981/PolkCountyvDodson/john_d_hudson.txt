mr.
john
d.
hudson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
agree
with
justice
marshal
that
the
place
to
begin
the
analysis
of
this
case
is
with
an
examination
of
the
relevant
statute
under
which
the
public
defender's
office
was
created.
in
iowa,
we
have
an
iowa
public
defender
act
which
is
found
at
chapter
336(a)
of
the
iowa
code.
under
this
particular
statute,
the
county
supervisors
of
a
particular
county
or
group
of
counties
if
they
so
choose
can
decide
by
resolution
to
form
a
public
defender's
office.
the
office
is
created
by
the
supervisors.
they
determine
a
budget
for
the
supervisors.
they
ask
the
district
judges
of
the
county
to
nominate
certain
individuals
who
would
be
well
qualified
to
serve
as
a
public
defender,
and
the
county
supervisors
select
the
individual
from
that
particular
list.
the
county
supervisors
are
given
the
responsibility
of
defining
the
term
"indigency",
which
thus
gives
them
the
power
to
decide
which
individuals
will
be
eligible
for
representation
by
the
public
defender.
in
addition
to
this...
these
responsibilities,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
public
defender
to
submit
an
annual
report
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
iowa,
to
the
chief
judge
of
the
judicial
district
in
which
he
practices,
and
also
to
the
county
supervisors.
the
supervisors
are
given
the
opportunity
of
terminating
the
office
at
any
time
that
they
deem
appropriate.
it
seems
clear,
and
it
was
acknowledged
by
the
eighth
circuit
that
this,
the
extensive
involvement
of
the
local
county
supervisors
in
the
public
defender
office
means
that
the
public
defender
himself
and
his
or
her
assistants
become
inextricably
linked
to
the
political
process.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
do
distinguish
on
this
ground.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
agree
with
mr.
jesse.
i
believe
the
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
is
barnes
versus
dorsey.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
and
that
particular
case
presently
holds
that
appointed
private
counsel
does
not
act
under
color
of
law.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
your
honor,
the
court
in
its
last
term,
in
the
case
of
cuyler
versus
sullivan,
has
placed
the
holdings
of
those
cases
in
jeopardy,
it
seems
to
me.
in
that
particular
case,
they
state
criminal
trial
was
found
to
be
an
action
by
the
state,
and
a
privately
retained
counsel
who
offered
ineffective
service
to
his
client
in
that
case
was
found
to
be
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
in
cuyler,
your
honor?
mr.
john
d.
hudson
the
color
of
law
question
was
certainly
not
raised
in
cuyler
versus
sullivan.
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
a
privately
retained
attorney
could
offer
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
to
the
extent
that
the
trial
became
a
meaningful
charade...
meaningless
charade,
and--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--so
this
court
held,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
would
concede
that
to
my
knowledge
every
circuit
court
has
so
held,
that
the--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--that
it
does
not
involve
state
action.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
the
eighth
circuit
has
so
held,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
well,
of
course,
we
are
all
subject
to
the
same
ethical
considerations,
your
honor,
and
we
are
all
subject
to
the
same
rules
and
regulations
governing
the
profession
of
the
practice
of
law.
the
regulation
that
i
am
talking
about
that
polk
county
imposes
upon
the
public
defender
is,
in
particular,
money.
they
have
the
opportunity
to
define
indigency.
it
is
conceivable,
at
least
under
the
iowa
statute,
that
they
could
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
indigency
shall
include
anyone
who
makes
less
than
$30,000
a
year,
so--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--they
do,
your
honor,
and
each
of
those
regulations
would
be
applicable
to
a
public
defender
as
well.
where
i
would
make
the
distinction
between
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
posed
would
be
the
extent
that
the
public
domain
does
exercise
control
over
the
public
defender.
in
other
words,
it
becomes
involved
in
the
political
process
through
the
funding,
through
the
appointment,
through
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
keep
the
office,
through
the
reports
that
must
be
made
to
the
supervisors
on
an
annual
basis,
and
et
cetera.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
why
not?
that
matter
has
been
the
subject
of
great
debate
in
this
court
and
in
many
courts
of
appeal.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
policy
considerations
were
carefully
reviewed
by
this
court
in
1979
in
the
case
of
ferri
versus
ackerman.
as
this
court
has
questioned
mr.
jesse
this
morning,
it
was
in
fact
a
state
malpractice
action.
however,
the
court's
inquiry
was
directed
to
whether
or
not
federal
law
required
the
imposition
of
an
absolute
immunity
for
a
private
attorney
who
was
appointed
under
the
criminal
justice
act.
this
court
in
reviewing
the
relevant
policy
considerations
determined
that
the...
a
defense
attorney's
function
is
considerably
different
from
that
of
a
prosecutor
or
of
a
judge.
i
would
agree
with
the
chief
justice's
comment
that
they
are
part
of
the
three
legs
of
a
particular
stool
upon
which
justice
rests,
but
the
distinction
must
be
that
the
defense
attorney,
unlike
the
judge
or
the
prosecutor,
owes
his
primary
allegiance
to
his
particular
client.
in
fact,
it
is
the
defense
lawyer's
obligation
to
vigorously
oppose
the
actions
of
the--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--well,
that
is
the
point
that
is
made
in
the
dissent
in
the
eighth
circuit,
your
honor,
that
an
aggrieved
defendant
will
look
to
the
public
defender.
i
don't
agree
with
that
particular
philosophy.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
a
private
attorney?
mr.
john
d.
hudson
we
have
in
iowa,
your
honor,
a
rule
that
is
modeled
after
this
court's
decision
in
anders
versus
california.
that
is
rule
104,
which
is
included
in
one
on
of
the
briefs
as
an
appendix,
i
believe.
that
rule,
as
i
read
it,
is
not
applicable
to
the
private
attorney.
my
response,
i
am
afraid,
would
be
that
the
private
attorney
should
not
have
accepted
the
case
in
the
beginning,
and
should
have
perhaps
reviewed
the
case.
the
appointed
counsel
finds
himself
in
a
different
position,
in
that
he
has
no
choice.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
the
duty
to
the
court,
it
would
be
my
judgment,
would
include
not
pursuing
frivolous
appeals.
if
the
consent
of
the
client
could
not
be
obtained,
i
would
think
that
an
application
to
withdraw
from
the
case
would
be
the
appropriate
response
to
that
situation.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
between
the
privately
retained
attorney--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--i
believe
this
court
in
anders,
your
honor,
recognized
that
there
was
a
similar
obligation,
and
you
cannot
unilaterally
simply
dismiss
an
appeal,
or
you
cannot
unilaterally
withdraw
from
the
case,
but
you
must
follow
a
procedure
that
was
carefully
delineated
in
anders.
you
have
to
notify
the
client.
you
have
to
brief
to
the
appellate
court
any
issues
that
are
at
least
arguable
on
their
merits.
and--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--i
think
you
would
still
have
the
same
duty.
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
the
procedures
must
be
somewhat
different--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--because
rule
104
does
not
include
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
posed,
but
still
the
obligation
to
the
court
not
to
waste
their
time
would
include,
it
should
seem
to
me,
a
procedure
somewhat
like
that.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
the
prosecutor,
your
honor?
mr.
john
d.
hudson
yes.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
it
is
shabby
lawyering,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--malpractice.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
no,
your
honor,
they
don't.
most
lawyers
practice
somewhat
defensively
in
the
criminal
law
area.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
well,
of
course,
this
court
in
brady
versus
maryland
and
other
such
similar
decisions
has--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
same
is
also
true
of
the
defense
counsel.
there
are
limited
circumstances
where
the
defense
counsel
has...
or
at
least
should
perform
some
act
that
may
well
be
directly
contrary
to
the
best
interests
of
his
client.
examples
would
include
when
a
defense
lawyer
knows
that
his
client
is
about
to
lie
on
the
witness
stand.
it
is
his
obligation
to
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
if
the
defense
lawyer
knows
that
a
serious
crime
is
about
to
be
committed,
it
also
is
imperative
upon
the
lawyer.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
yes,
your
honor,
but
not
to
participate
in
the
deception--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--not
to
attempt
to
elicit
testimony
from
the
witness.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
that
is--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--i
believe
there
is
such
an
allegation.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
well,
to
say
the
very
minimum,
the
complaint
is
inarticulate,
justice
stevens,
and
it
is
my--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--he
uses
conclusory
language
to
assert
such
a
violation,
but
the
underlying
facts
at
least
that
are
set
forth
in
this--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--well,
i
am
not
going
to
concede
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
would
state
to
the
court
that
because
of
the
procedural
posture
of
this
particular
case,
we
know
very
little
about
the
underlying
merits.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
that
would
be
true
as
a
habeas
petition.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
he--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--not
before
this
court
today.
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
he
did
include
in
the
pro
se
complaint
that
was
filed
with
judge
vietor
a
request
to
be
released
from
prison--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--and
the
request
to
be
released
was
treated
as
an
application
for
habeas,
and
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
state
remedies
had
not
been
exhausted,
but
in
direct
answer
to
your
question--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--your
honor,
the
way
that
the
case
was
procedurally
handled,
we
don't
know
the
merits
of
the
underlying
complaint.
no
hearing
was
granted
in
the
district
court.
you
inquired
of
mr.
jesse
as
to
the
rule
104
procedure.
i
don't
find
a
clear
answer
to
that
in
the
record
before
this
court
this
morning...
this
afternoon,
and
you
know,
perhaps
it
is
a
matter
of--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--it
has
never
been
the
requirement
of
this
court
since
monroe
versus
pape
that
state
remedies
be
exhausted
prior
to
the
prosecution
of
a
section
1983
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
believe
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
well,
it--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--well,
the
elements
of
this
particular
offense
also
have
not
been
defined
by
any
lower
court,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
elements
of
this
particular
segment
of
section
1983
are
before
the
court
this
afternoon,
and
so
the
computation
of
damages,
i
would
suggest
that
we
rely
merely
upon
tort
principles,
as
this
court
has
suggested.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
don't
know
if
that
is
clear,
your
honor.
it
would
turn
again
upon
relevant
principles
of
tort
law.
that
would
go,
however,
not
to
the...
that
would
go
to
the
question
of
damages,
and
not
to
the
question--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
true.
what
about
the
situation,
however,
where
he
could
prove
a
constitutional
violation
that
was
deemed
to
be
harmless
error.
under
section--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--under
section
1983,
that
may
well
be
a
compensable
injury.
we
must
understand
that
the
questions
that
you
are
raising
with
me
right
now
go
to
the
question
of
damages.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
well,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
it
does
state
a
cause
of
action,
and
you
make
some
very
valid
points,
your
honor,
regarding
damages,
but--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--it
does,
and
that
is
the
basic
purpose,
justice
marshal,
of--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--the
district
judge
did
dismiss
it
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
finding
that--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--for
failure
to
state
a--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--well,
i
would
again
reiterate
my
position,
your
honor,
that
it
has
never
been
the
rule
or
the
law
under
section
1983
that
prior
state
remedies
must
first
be
exhausted.
the
court
is
making
reference,
i
believe,
to
a
habeas
action
in
the
state
courts
of
iowa.
it
has
always
been
the
rule
since
monroe
versus
pape
that
you
can
proceed
directly
to
federal
court,
and
the
purpose,
in
fact,
of
1983
is
to
provide
a
federal
forum
for
compensation
of
injuries.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
we
are
not
attacking
the
custody.
we
want
compensation
for
the
constitutional
violation.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
robbery.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
twenty-five
years,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
there
was
an
appeal
which
became
the
subject
of
this
particular
lawsuit,
and
i
don't
believe
the
record
clearly
reflects
the
disposition
of
that
particular
appeal.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
i
don't
believe
that
it
was,
your
honor,
because
mrs.
shepard
represented
him
in
that
appeal,
and
she
unlikely
would
raise
that.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
hudson
and
not
pursuing
the
appeal,
justice
stevens,
for
what
mr.
dodson
believed--
mr.
john
d.
hudson
--to
be
meritorious
grounds.
