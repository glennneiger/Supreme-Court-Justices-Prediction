mr.
norman
g.
jesse
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
proceeding
arose
out
of
a
pro
se
complaint
filed
by
the
respondent
under
42
usc
1983
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa,
november
5th,
1979.
that
complaint
alleged
various
claims
against
the
petitioner
martha
shepard
in
the
polk
county
offender
advocate's
office
against
the
polk
county
board
of
supervisors
and
against
the
entity
of
polk
county.
respondent
alleged
that
petitioner
shepard
had
failed
to
properly
represent
him
on
appeal
of
his
conviction
for
first
degree
robbery
in
the
district
court
of
iowa
in
and
for
polk
county
to
the
iowa
supreme
court.
he
claimed
that
her
actions
in
failing
to...
in
failing
to
represent
him
properly
in
that...
in
that
appeal
had
deprived
him
of
his
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
imposed
upon
him
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
had
arbitrarily
denied
him
his
state-created
right
to
appeal
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
from
its
conviction.
he
also
asserted
claims
for...
for
legal
malpractice
and
for
breach
of
an
oral
contract
to
prosecute
the
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
the
polk
county
offender
advocate
was
also
named.
the
board
of
supervisors
of
polk
county
and
polk
county
itself
were
named,
alleging
that
they
were
responsible
for
ms.
shepard's
action
because
they
had
adopted
established
rules
and
procedures
for
handling
such
appeals.
his
complaint
sought
injunctive
relief.
it
is
of
monetary
damages
and
release
from
confinement.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint,
ruling
that
petitioner
shepard
and
the
offender
advocate
did
not
act
under
color
of
state
law,
that
the
complaint
did
not
allege
the
requisite
personal
involvement
of
the
polk
county...
members
of
the
polk
county
board
of
supervisors,
or
of
the
polk
county
offender
advocate.
it
construed
his
request
for...
for
release
to
be
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
and
found
that
he
had
not
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
and
therefore
dismissed
that
as
well.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
finding
that
the
county
employed
the
public
defender,
and
that
a
county...
county
employed
public
defender
does
act
under
color
of
state
law,
because
the
public
defender
in
that
situation
is
selected,
paid,
hired
and
fired
by
the
county,
that
the
public
defenders
have
their
power
because
of
the
fact
that
they
are
employed
to
represent
indigent
defendants,
and
not
because
they
have
been
selected
by
the
defendants
for
whom
they
are
providing
representation.
having
decided
that
the
county
employed
public
defender
is...
is
involved
in
state
action,
then
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
county
employed
public
defender
enjoys
only
a
qualified
immunity,
and
further,
that
as
a
matter
of
pleading,
that
the
respondent
had
stated
a
1983
claim
against
the
board
of
supervisors
and
the
offender
advocate.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
no,
i
don't
believe
the
court
indicated
that
they
would
intend
any
such
result.
i
don't
believe
that
question
was
discussed.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
that
is
not
the
law,
as
i
understand
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--well,
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
that
would
seem
to
be
a
logical
extension
from
the
finding
that
because
they
are
county
employed
and
have
not
been
selected,
that
they
are
involved
in
state
action.
by
the
same
rationale
you
could
say
that
the
license
provided
to
practice
law
was
state
action
sufficient
to
make
a
privately
employed
counsel
amenable
to
suit.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
i
do
not
agree
that
that
is
the
law,
and
we
are
contending
otherwise.
petitioner
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
presenting
two
questions,
and
that
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
the
county
employed
public
defender
acts
under
color
of
state
law
in
representing
indigent
defendants,
and
is
thus
amenable
to
suit
under
42
usc
1983,
and
two,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
in
suits
brought
under
42
usc
1983
a
county
employed
public
defender
enjoys
only
a
qualified
immunity
from
suit
for
his
actions
taken
while
representing
indigent
clients.
this
court
granted
cert
march
2,
1981.
the
court
is
favored
here
with
amicus
briefs
by
the
united
states,
by
the
national
legal
aid
and
defenders
association,
by
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers,
and
by
the
minnesota
state
public
defender.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
i
would
think
that
a
private
attorney
employed
by
a
defendant
would
not
be
amenable
to
suit
under
1983.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
there
is
such
authority
in
the
eighth
district
and--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--or
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--certainly
it
would
be
difficult
to
have
those
inconsistent
results
of
a
private
attorney
amenable
to
suit
and
a
court-appointed
attorney
not.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
no,
the
prosecutor
has
absolute
immunity.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
the
judge
has
absolute
immunity.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well,
it
is
our
contention
that
he
is
not
functioning
in
that
capacity,
that
he
is
not
essentially
different
than
the...
in
terms
of
the
public
policy
ramifications,
than
is
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge.
however,
in
a
very
limited
context,
this
court
has,
in
ferri
versus
ackerman,
decided
that
he
is
not
a
part
of
a
tri-partite
equal
person
for
purposes
of
applying--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--that's
correct.
in
a
state
t
malpractice
suit,
that
the
court
would
not
apply
a
federal
absolute
immunity
to
that
situation.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
that's
correct,
and
that
is
our
position,
that
the--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--that
the
public
defender
is
really
analogous
to
court-appointed
counsel,
court-appointed
private
counsel,
and--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--i
think
that
he
is
required
to
be
by
both
the
canons
of
ethics
by
his
responsibilities
as
a
lawyer,
to
be...
to
owe
his
sole
obligation
and
his
sole-his
sole
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendant.
the
fact
that
he
is
employed
as
a
public
defender
and
is
paid
by
the
county
is--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--i
believe
not.
he
is
not
under
the
control
of
the
board
of
supervisors
of
polk
county
in
any
respect
as
it
relates
to
his
handling
of
his
client's
case,
and
the
responsibilities
and
obligations
that
he
owes
to
his
client.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
there
is
a
sense
in
which
that
is
true,
yes,
and
the
respondents--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--and
the
united
states
have
cited
cases
which
would
analogize
the
situation
of
the
professional
relationship
between
the
attorney
and
his
indigent
client,
and
a
medical
director
of
a
state
mental
health
institute
or
some
similar
facility.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--right,
respondent--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--the
state
action
question
was
not...
was
not
precisely
addressed
in
o'connor
but
that
mainly
turned
on
the
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment
feature.
it
assumed,
however,
state
action,
and
the
difference--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--you
allowed
liability,
and
so--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--so
state
action
is
assumed.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
there
is
no
difference,
but
you
need
to
look
further
than
just
whether
or
not
that
professional
relationship
existed
between
the
patient
and
the
medical
director,
and
whether
or
not
that
is
different
than
the
position
of
an
attorney,
a
public
defender
and
his
indigent
defendant,
and
there
is
a
difference.
the
difference
is
that
the
medical
director
of
a
state
mental
health
institute
is
performing
both
a
medical
function
for
which
he
has
a
relationship
and
providing
for
another
state
interest
which
is
providing
for
the
housing
and
confinement
of
persons
and
treatment
of
persons
with
mental
illness.
so
there
is
another--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--the
public
defender
is
satisfying
the
public
interest
that
is
imposed
upon
them
by
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
the
cases
construing
the
right
to
counsel,
and
the
requirement
that
the
state
provide
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
however,
when
you
look
at
the
activity
of
the
lawyer
involved,
it
is
clear
that
he
represents
an
interest
that
is
contrary
to
the
state's
real
interest,
and
that
is
the
prosecution
and
confinement
of
persons
who
are
convicted
of
crime.
that
is
the
state's
interest.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well,
that
is
true
in
the
adversary
context,
except
that
the...
except
that
the...
it
would
be
very
difficult
when
you
have
a
state
institution
that
without
question
deprives
a
person
of
his
liberty
and
a
person
functioning
within
that
institution
who
has
the
medical
relationship
between
the
client,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
that
that
person
who
is
directing
that
institution
that
confines
the
person
was
not
engaged
in
state
conduct,
and
that
is
not
related
to
the
function,
the
medical
function
that
is
being
performed
by
that
individual.
it
has
to
do
with
the
unquestioned
state
action
of
depriving
the
person
of
liberty,
and
the
maintenance
of
that
institution,
state
institution
for
that
purpose.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well,
we
would
argue
that
the
prosecutor,
or
that
the
defense
attorney
really
performs
in
the
broad
social
sense
the
same
kind
of
functions--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--and
ought
to
be
accorded
the
same
kind
of--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--yes.
yes,
because
he
is
providing
the
necessary
ingredient
of
providing
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
that
is
correct.
the
prosecution
and
the...
the
prosecutor
is
involved
in
the
prosecution
of
persons
who
are
accused
of
crime,
and
that
is
part
of
the
state
function
that
is
his
responsibility,
and
the
public
defender
is
involved
in
providing
that
other
essential
ingredient
for
a
valid
conviction,
which
is
in
the
state's
interest,
and
that
is
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
no,
we
would
argue
that
they
are
not
essentially
different,
and
that
if,
as
the
eighth
circuit
has
ruled
in
this
case,
if
a
public
defender
whose
only
real
relationship
to
the
state
is
that
he
receives
his
paycheck
from
the
state
is
amenable
to
1983
suits,
that
a
court-appointed
attorney
would...
who
performs
essentially
the
same
services
and
is
paid
from
the
very
same
pot
of
money
is
paid
from
the
very
same
levy
as
the
public
defender.
and
as
it
happens
in
polk
county,
the
board
of
supervisors
of
polk
county
have
in
operation
a
dual
system
of
providing
for
counsel.
they
have
the
defender
advocates
program,
which
is
a
county
program,
paid
for
out
of
the
court
fund,
and
they
have
a
parallel
system
of
court-appointed
private
attorneys.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well,
we
maintain
that
you
should
not
treat
them
separately,
but
the--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--the
court
of
appeals
would
treat
them
separately.
we
maintain
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
a
court-appointed
private
attorney
who
is
paid
out
of
the
court
fund
and
a
public
defender
who
is
paid
for
out
of
the
court
fund.
the
state
is
involved
in
the
determination
of
indigency
in
both
cases,
and
it
is
the
same...
the
same
determination
of
what
indigency
is
as
it
applies
to
a
particular
defendant.
the
court
makes
the
appointment
in
the
one
case
or
in
the
other,
and
all
the...
all
the
county
has
done
as
a
practical
matter,
all
the
county
has
done
is
to
organize
a
group
of
attorneys
into
one
office,
where
theoretically
they
can
be
provided
with
better
library
facilities
and
better
secretarial
services,
and
can
be
provided
an
investigator,
and
the
capacity
to
provide
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
rather
than
paying
a
higher
per
hour
or
higher
per
unit
cost
to
a
private
attorney
who
must
provide
his
own
library
and
his
own
secretary
and
his
own
investigative
services.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
no,
it
did
not,
and
this
court
has
not
addressed
directly
that
question.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well,
but
the
state,
it
was
leasing
the
facility
from
the
state,
and
the
state
was
involved
in
a
parallel
operation
with
the
restaurant
owner,
and
presumably
they...
both
parties
benefitted
from
that
relationship.
the
restaurant
operator
benefitted
from
the
parking
facilities
that
were
available,
and
the
presence
of
the
parking
facilities
benefitted
the
restaurant
owner
by
the
presence
of
customers.
that
is
quite
a
different
relationship
than
the...
than
the
board
of
supervisors
has
with
the
offender
advocate
program
in
polk
county,
and
we
believe
that
what
you
need
to
look
at
is
the...
is
the
action
that
is
complained
about,
the
action
that
is
complained
about,
and
not--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--well,
i
believe
that
the
court
has
already
in
a
sense
applied
a
kind
of
function
test
in
branti
versus
finkel,
where
state
action
was
found
with
respect
to
the
public
defenders
program,
but
it
was
found
in
the
context
of
the
public
defender
terminating
the
employment
of
certain
persons
who
worked
for
him.
now,
that
is
clearly
and
unmistakably
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
is
conferred
by
the
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
the
public
defender,
the
individual
public
defender,
who
might
be
amenable
to
suit
under
the
eighth
circuit's
theory
of
this
case,
does
not
exercise
that
power.
that
person
exercises
the
power
that
any
attorney
has,
and
that
power
only,
and
the
fact
of
the
creation
of
the
public
defender's
office
does
not
enhance
the
powers
that
are
exercised,
or
enhance
the
activities
that
the
public...
assistant
public
defender
is
involved
in.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
the
board
of
supervisors
appoints
the
offender
advocate
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
no,
to...
no,
they
appoint
the
offender
advocate,
and
the
offender
advocate
has
several
assistants
that
he
appoints.
the
board
of
supervisors
approves
their
appointments
and
sets
their
salary.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
he
appoints
the
offender
advocate's
office.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
or,
a
person
from
the
assigned
counsel
list.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well,
they
maintain
a
list
of
persons
who
have
agreed
to
accept
appointments.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
the
supervisors
pay
both.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
the
supervisors
create
a
budget
for
the
office
of
offender
advocate.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
and
they
are
on
annual
salaries.
they
are
prohibited
from
engaging
in
private...
in
other
private
practice.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
well,
but
if
he--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--i
believe
that
there
is
no
essential
difference.
the
structure
of
the
offender
advocate
program
is
merely
a
why
of
collecting
together
the
persons
who
are
providing
those
services
to
indigent
defendants,
hopefully
provide
them
with
better
facilities,
and--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--but
the
effect
is
exactly
the
same,
because
lawyer
jones
has
to
have
an
office,
and
the
judge
is,
when
he
approves
that
fee,
is
paying
part
of
his
rent
and
part
of
his
telephone
and
part
of
his
secretary
and
part
of
his
library.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
to
the
individual.
every
case
is
assigned
by
the
offender
advocate
to
an
individual
lawyer.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
the
court
does
not
select
from
among
the
lawyers
in
the
offender
advocate's
office.
there
are
nine
lawyers,
and
the
court
does
not
select.
he
appoints
the
offender
advocate
to
be
the
person,
and
the
offender
advocate
delegates
the
responsibility
to
the--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--well,
this
presents
a
public
policy
argument
that...
that
is
involved
in
the
eighth
circuit's
decision,
and
that
is
that
rather
than
enhancing
the
t
capability
of
the
county
to
provide
indigent
services,
provide
representation
of
indigents
through
the
creation
of
offender
advocates
programs
or
public
defenders,
they
will
abandon
those
and
go
to
a
total
system
of
assigned
counsel
on
an
appointment
basis
of
private
attorneys
in
order
to
avoid
the
exposure
to
1983
actions.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
you
have
not
yet
decided
that.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
i
think
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
did
not
decide
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
case
was
disposed
of
under
rule
104,
which
provides
for
the
dismissal
of
frivolous
appeals,
and
the
court
did,
pursuant
to
the
motion
of
mrs.
shepard,
dismiss
that
case.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
respondent
and
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states
in
particular
with
concern...
with
respect
to
their
ability
to
file
section
242
criminal
prosecutions,
would
have
the
court
look
no
further
than
the
kind
of
instrumentality
argument
about
whether
or
not
the
county
has
established
a
public
defender
program,
irrespective
of
what
the
real
actions
are,
and
they
point
out
that...
that
the
petitioners
have
not
referred
to
the
case
of
united
states
versus
classic,
but
unites
states
versus
classic
does
tell
us
that
the
activity
that
is
aimed
at
in
1983
actions
is
the
misuse
of
power
possessed
by
virtue
of
state
law
and
made
possible
only
because
the
wrongdoer
is
cloaked
with
the
authority
of
state
law--
mr.
norman
g.
jesse
--yes,
but
in
this
particular,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
we
ought
to
look
at
the
activity,
and
not
merely
that
it
is
an
instrumentality,
because
it
is
the
activity
that
is
important,
and
that
activity
is
not.
it's
the
representation,
and
that
does
not
depend
upon
the
creation
of
the
public
defender,
but
is
the
result
of
being
licensed
to
practice
law,
as
is
true
of
every
lawyer.
