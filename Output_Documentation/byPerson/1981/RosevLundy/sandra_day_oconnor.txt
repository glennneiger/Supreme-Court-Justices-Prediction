justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
principle
of
comity
underlying
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
28
u.s.
code
section
2254
and
the
policy
of
avoiding
piecemeal
litigation
in
the
federal
courts
require
federal
district
courts
to
dismiss
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
that
contain
any
claims
that
have
not
been
exhausted
in
the
state
courts.
after
the
district
court
has
dismissed
a
next
petition
containing
both
exhausted
and
unexhausted
claims,
the
prisoner
has
the
choice
of
returning
to
a
state
court
to
exhaust
his
claims
or
of
amending
or
resubmitting
his
habeas
petition
to
present
only
the
exhausted
claims
to
the
district
court.
in
part
iii-c
of
the
opinion,
a
plurality
of
the
court
has
written
that
by
deleting
his
unexhausted
claims
and
returning
immediately
to
federal
court,
thus
deliberately
setting
aside
his
unexhausted
claims,
the
prisoner
risks
dismissal
of
subsequent
habeas
petitions
under
rule
9(b)
of
the
habeas
statute.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.

opinion

iii-c.
