mr.
d.
shannon
smith
mr.
chief
justice...
excuse
me...
may
it
please
the
court...
excuse
me...
first
let
me
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
we
have
no
argument
with
the
exhaustion
requirement.
we
feel
that
mr.
lundy
properly
exhausted
the
two
claims
upon
which
relief
was
granted
in
the
district
court.
in
fact,
in
the
state's
answer
to
mr,
lundy's
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
state
admitted
the
exhaustion
of
the
first
two
claims,
and
asked
for
dismissal
of
the
latter
two
claims
for
failure
of
exhaustion
of
remedies.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
i
disagree
very
strongly
on
the
flat
rule
which
he
wants.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
in
the
case
or
in
the
unexhausted
issue?
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
if
the--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--under
the
exhaustion
requirement,
the
federal
district
courts
should
not
deal
with
that
issue,
but
if
the
petition
presents
along
with
that
issue
issues
that
have
been
presented
to
the
state
courts--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--that's
a
possibility.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
and
it
is
a
possibility
that
we
have
to
face.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
the
two
exhausted...
or
the
two
unexhausted
claims,
which
were
not
related
to
the
exhausted
claims
were
improper
jury
instruction
and
the
prosecution's
comment
on
the
defendant
not
taking
the
witness
stand.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
your
honor,
i
believe
he
is
saying
that
because
these
two,
the
latter
two
claims
have
not
been
exhausted,
that
the
court
cannot
grant
relief
on
those
two
claims.
however,
in
assessing
the
merits
of
the
first
two
claims,
and
the
state
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
tennessee
also
found
merit
in
those
claims,
but
found
it
harmless
error,
but
the
federal
court,
in
assessing
those
first
two
claims,
had
to
look
at
the
atmosphere
of
the
trial
as
a
whole,
and
that
involved
looking
at
the
errors
that
were
raised
in
the
two
unexhausted
claims.
however,
i
don't
believe
relief
was
granted
on
those
two
errors.
it
was
granted
on
the
first
two
claims
which
were
exhausted,
prosecutorial
misconduct
and
the
limitation
of
cross
examination.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
that's
correct,
but
i
believe
he
reviewed
those
and
mentioned
those
to
show
their
impact
on
the
exhausted
claims,
making...
substantiating
his
decision
that
this
was
not
harmless
error,
but
was
prejudicial
error.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
taking
those...
taking
those
two
claims,
the
two
exhausted
claims
on
their
own,
isolated,
perhaps
not.
i
don't
think
he
can
isolate
them.
he
has
got
to
look
at
them
in
the
context
of
the
trial
in
order
to
find
whether
they
are
harmless
error.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
these
claims
are
related.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
i
believe
he
has
get
to
look
at
the
exhausted
claims
in
the
context
in
which
they
occur,
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
is
harmless
error
or
prejudicial
error,
and
in
looking
at
that
context,
he
has
to
look
at
the
whole
trial,
including
those
errors
which
were
unexhausted,
but
nowhere
does
be
say
that
he
is
granting
relief.
in
fact,
he
states
just
the
opposite,
that
he
will
not
consider
the
unexhausted
claims
in
the
constitutional
framework.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
your
honor,
if
i
had
to
write
the
opinion,
i
think
it
would
have
been
written
in
somewhat
different
language.
i
realize
that
it
is
difficult
in
reading
the
opinion
to
separate
the
claims.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
considered
what
was
put
in
front
of
it
by
lundy
and
by
the
petitioner
in
this
matter.
i
think
it
took
the
time,
it
reviewed
the
record
that
was
placed
in
front
of
it.
he
states
in
his
opinion,
the
district
court
judge,
that
he
reviewed
the
record,
and
i
think
he
wrote
the
opinion,
and
i
think
basically
he
granted
relief
on
the
two
exhausted
claims.
as
i
pointed
out
before,
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
of
tennessee
also
found--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--in
the
opinion
written
by
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
of
tennessee,
it
does
not
appear
that
they
did.
it
appears
that
they
were--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--no,
your
honor.
it
appears
that
the
two
exhausted
claims
were
considered
together
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
tennessee.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
i
don't
believe
they
did.
petitioner
argues
that
if
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
contains
a
mixture
of
exhausted
and
unexhausted
claims,
the
entire
petition
must
be
dismissed
without
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
exhausted
claims.
the
prisoner
must
then
leave
his
exhausted
claims,
which
may
be
meritorious,
sitting
on
the
district
courthouse
steps
and
go
back
to
the
state
courts
with
his
unexhausted
claims,--
now,
the
basis
of
the
proposition
put
forth
by
petitioner,
at
least
in
his
brief
filed
in
this
court,
was
comity.
in
the
reply
brief
filed
in
this
court,
he
stated
that
the
basis
of
this
proposition
was
jurisdictional,
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
petitions
which
contained
exhausted
and
unexhausted
claims.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
the
case.
if
the
court
wishes
to
pursue
that
matter,
this
is
the
case
in
which
it
is
to
be
raised.
if
it
is
the
case,
and
if
the
court
feels
so,
i
feel
that
both
sides
should
be
permitted
to
brief
that
jurisdictional
issue.
as
to
the
argument
based
on
comity,
again,
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
exhaustion
requirement.
28
usc
2254,
subsection
c,
requires
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
as
to
the
question
presented
before
the
court
can
grant
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it
does
not
require
exhaustion
of
every
question
presented
in
a
petition
before
a
writ
can
be
granted
on
the
basis
of
an
exhausted
question
contained
in
the
petition.
when
the
rule
was
codified
in
1948,
it
was
designed
to
recognize
the
law
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
as
it
existed
at
that
time,
it
referred
to
a
question,
a
claim,
individual.
there
are
no
cases
since
then
from
this
court
which
apply
that
requirement
in
the
manner
requested
by
the
petitioner.
the
gooding
case
in
1972
and
the
francisco
case
in
1974,
in
both
those
cases,
this
court
considered
petitions
which
included
mixed
claims.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
tennessee
has
had
a
full
opportunity
to
review
the
two
exhausted
claims.
the
policy
served
by
the
exhaustion
requirement
would
not
be
furthered
by
requiring
submission
of
the
unexhausted
claims
to
the
state
courts
of
tennessee.
the
conflict
is
already
there
between
the
state
court
and
the
federal
court.
the
conflict
is
there
on
the
two
exhausted
claims.
sending
the
case
back
to
the
state
court
would
produce
one
of
two
results.
either
the
state
court
reaches
the
same
result
as
the
federal
court
for
a
different
reason,
that
being
the
unexhausted
claim
instead
of
an
exhausted
claim,
or
the
state
court
goes
through
the
futility
of
considering
the
two
unexhausted
claims,
knowing
full
well
that
the
district
court
has
already
found...
and
the
circuit
court
both
have
already
found
merit
in
the
exhausted
claims,
and
no
matter
what
their
ruling,
the
petition
is
going
to
be
granted
at
some
date
in
the
future.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
correct.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
it
is
our
position
that
neither
result
which
may
come
about
from
sending
this
case
back
to
the
state
court
would
promote
comity,
and
in
the
meantime,
lundy
remains
in
prison
while
he
pursues
his
claims
through
the
state
court,
claims
in
which
he
now
has
no
interest,
because
he
has
had
two
claims
which
a
district
court
and
a
circuit
court
have
found
merit
in.
he
sits
in
jail
and
pursues
his
claims.
comity
does
not
demand
the
state
court
to
go
through
the
futile
or
the
academic
exercise
of
considering
a
case
when
the
results
of
that
case
are
already
known.
as
to
the
state
itself,
it
suffers
a
disadvantage
in
the
passage
of
time
because
it
makes
retrial
more
difficult
at
the
time
the
writ
is
finally
granted
and
a
retrial
ordered.
in
his
brief,
the
petitioner
states
that
the
state
courts
would
have
applied
a
contemporaneous
objection
rule
and
refused
to
consider
claims
that
could
have
been
but
were
not
presented
on
direct
review
of
conviction.
the
two
unexhausted
claims
in
this
case
were
not
presented
on
direct
review
of
his
conviction.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
no.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
correct,
and
the
state
court,
i
am
sure,
would
see
those
two
faults
immediately
upon
considering
it.
perhaps
the
district
court
thought
that
through
and
realized
the
futility
of
sending
those
two
unexhausted
claims
back
to
the
state
courts,
to
have
them
merely
invoke
a
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
meanwhile
with
the
petitioner
sitting
in
jail.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
he
considered
them.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
he
considered
everything
in
front
of
him,
and
those--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--the
state
court
had
the
entire
trial
transcript
in
front
of
it.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
he
did
not
make
those
particular
claims
at
that
point.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
okay.
when
i
say
that
perhaps
without
these
unexhausted
claims
the
district
court
judge
would
not
have
granted
relief,
i
perhaps
did
not
explain
myself
very
well.
in
fact,
i
am
quite
sure
i
didn't.
had
these--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--had
these...
not
now,
i
didn't.
had
these
unexhausted
claims
not
been
presented
to
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
had
only
these
two
exhausted
claims
to
consider,
i
believe
that
in
reviewing
the
record,
the
district
court
would
have
considered
those
two
exhausted
claims
in
the
light
of
what
else
went
on,
including
these
two
unexhausted
claims,
even
if
they
weren't
presented
to
it.
that
is
where
i
think
the
unexhausted
claims
come
in.
it
considers
the
exhausted
claims
in
the
light
of
the
erroneous
jury
instruction,
whether
or
not
it
was
a
claim,
and
in
the
light
of
the
attorney
general's
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
i
hope
i
have
made
myself
a
little
clearer.
i
feel
that
the
effect
of
the
adoption
of
petitioner's
view
would
be
to
overwhelm
the
state
courts
with
consideration
of
after
thought
or
frivolous
claims,
while
the
federal
court
would
be
sitting
on
meritorious
claims
or
else
the
meritorious
claims
would
be
sitting
on
the
courthouse
steps.
meanwhile,
the
prisoner
remains--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--your
honor,
that
would
be
a
nice
way
to
have
it.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
we
are
dealing,
and
we
have
to
remember,
the
majority
of
these
petitions
are
filed
pro
se
by
men
who
are
uneducated
in
the
law,
and
possibly
uneducated,
period.
the
idea
has
been
put
forth
that
these
uneducated
men
can
use
the
law
in
order
to
orchestrate
their
claims
so
as
to
always
have
a
couple
sitting
back
here
in
case
these
get
turned
down,
and
they
can
keep
coming
back
and
coming
back.
this
court
in
1976
adopted
a
form
for
use
in
these
cases.
it
was
the
form
that
lundy
used
in
this
case.
it
is
a
pre-printed
form.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
no,
your
honor,
this
court,
the
supreme
court.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
correct.
it
contains
in
that
form
instructions.
number
6
of
that
instruction
reads,
and
i
quote...
this
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
66...
"your
attention
is
directed
to
the
fact
that
you
must
include
all
grounds
for
relief
and
all
facts
supporting
such
grounds
for
relief
in
the
petition
you
file
seeking
relief
from
any
judgment
of
conviction.
"
to
an
uneducated
man,
who
has
probably
never
heard
of
the
exhaustion
requirement,
let
alone
mixed
claims
presented
in
a
petition,
who
is
trying
to
follow
directions,
when
he
sees
that,
he
is
going
to
put
down
every
claim
he
can
think
of.
he
is
not
a
man
who
has
gone
through
trial
with
the
benefit
of
legal
experience,
able
to
dick
out
an
error
here
and
an
error
there.
sometimes
it
may
be
years
after
that
somebody,
a
cellmate
tells
him
about
what
happened
at
his
trial
that
was
error,
or
something--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--yes,
it
comes
to
light
to
him.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
if
the
court--
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
--no,
it
goes
into
a
caution
later
in
the
form
about
having
exhausted
claims,
but
if
the
court
adopts
the
rule
saying
that
mixed
petitions
must
be
dismissed,
then
this
form
is
a
trap.
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
i
am
aware
of
that.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
i
am
aware.
your
honor,
i
think
that
rule
9(b)
and
the
code
section
2244
give
the
district
courts
ammunition
to
deal
with
something
like
that,
and
i
don't
feel
that
because
some
people
have
abused
the
writ,
that
we
should
take
the
man
who
has
a
meritorious
claim
and
say,
you've
only
got
one
shot
at
this,
and
you
are
going
to
sit
in
jail
until
you
put
everything
through
the
state
courts,
all
these
possible
claims,
before
you
can
come
to
the
federal
district
court.
i
feel
that
is
denying
him
access
to
the
courts.
as
to
the
restriction
of
cross
examination
of
the
complainant
witness,
that
one
error
in
itself
i
feel
would
call
for
granting
of
the
writ.
everything
else
set
aside,
the
right
of
cross
examination
is
so
vital,
especially
in
a
case
like
this,
to
the
guarantee
of
a
free
trial,
that
the
denial
of
that
restriction
is
prejudicial
error.
this
court
has
found
so
in
the
alford
case.
there
is
reference
made
in
the
petitioner's
brief
to
a
jury-out
hearing.
mr.
d.
shannon
smith
that
claim
was
exhausted,
and
it
was
so
admitted
in
the
state's
answer.
there
was
reference
to
a
jury-out
hearing
where
some
of
these
questions
were
posed
to
the
complainant
witness,
but
a
jury...
or
a
hearing...
a
cross
examination
outside
the
trier
of
the
fact
is
of
absolutely
no
value.
the
jury
has
a
right
to
see
that
witness
when
she
is
asked
that
question
and
when
she
answers
that
question.
can
she
look
them
in
the
eye?
does
she
hesitate?
does
she...
they
have
a
right
to
observe
her
demeanor.
and
that
issue
alone,
i
think,
calls
for
the
granting
of
the
writ.
in
closing,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
designed
to
give
relief
to
those
unjustly
imprisoned.
it
is
a
fact.
i
stated
before,
that
most
of
these
petitioners
file
these
pro
se,
and
most
petitioners
are
uneducated,
at
least
in
the
law.
the
exhaustion
rule
as
treated
by
the
court
is
a
law
of
timing.
it
is
not
a
rule
of
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
and
neither
is
it
meant
to
he
an
obstacle
to
be
put
in
the
path
of
a
prisoner
who
is
imprisoned
unjustly,
and
merely
to
say
that
because
there
are
those
who
file
frivolous
claims,
we
must
deal
more
harshly
with
those
who
have
meritorious
claims.
i
don't
feel
that
is
the
correct
way
to
interpret
the
law.
there
are
two
courts
now
that
have
found
merit
in
lundy's
petition.
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you
very
much.
