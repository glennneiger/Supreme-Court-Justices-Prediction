unknown
speaker
mr.
zimmermann,
what
do
you
make
of
the
paragraph
in
judge
morton's
opinion
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
88,
where
he
says,
"since
grounds
3
and
4
have
not
been
presented
to
the
state
court,
there
has
been
no
exhaustion
of
remedies
as
to
those
two.
"
"thus
this
court
will
not
consider
them
in
the
constitutional
framework.
"
"however,
in
assessing
the
atmosphere
of
the
cause
taken
as
a
whole,
these
items
may
be
referred
to
collaterally?
"
unknown
speaker
you
suggest
they
might
have
granted
relief
on
the
claims
which
were
not
made
then
but
are
made
now?
unknown
speaker
how
does
one
go
about
separating
out
separate
claims
of
prosecutorial
misconduct?
what
is
it
in
the
federal
constitution
that
forbids
prosecutorial
misconduct?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
a
claim
in
the
federal
court,
federal
habeas
court,
that
my
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
were
violated
would
raise
every
single
conceivable
federal
constitutional
right
that
a
person
had
in
a
criminal
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimmermann,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
two
claims
that...
if
there
were
two
claims
presented
in
a
petition
for
habeas
and
they
were
wholly
independent?
say
one
was
a
fifth
amendment
claim,
another
a
sixth
amendment
claim;
one
a
compulsory
incrimination
claim
and
another
a
denial
of
jury
trial
or
something,
or
denial
of
counsel,
wholly
independent.
one
of
them
has
been
exhausted
and
the
other
hasn't.
would
you
say
that
the
federal
judge
should
dismiss
the
entire
case,
or
just
say,
sorry,
but
there
is
one
thing
here
that
isn't
exhausted,
i
will
adjudicate
the
other?
unknown
speaker
what,
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
good
would
it
do
to
remand
the
claim
that
has
already
been
exhausted?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
i
think
judges
still
look
at
habeas
corpus
petitions
in
terms
of
the
claims
they
present,
and
if,
for
example,
a
claim
is
repeated
that
he
has
just
ruled
on,
he
doesn't
pay
any
attention
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
is
not
going
to
get
prompt
federal
review
on
one
of
them
that
he
has
already
had
heard
in
the
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
dismiss
it?
why
don't
you
just
say
he
holds
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
never...
this
case
wouldn't
be
here
if
we
had
ruled
on
your
claim
before.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimmermann,
supposing
as
in
this
case
he
asserts
four
claims,
the
judge
looks
at
it
and
thinks
there
is
some
substance
to
one
or
two
of
them,
and
appoints
counsel
for
the
prisoner,
because
these
pleadings
are
drafted
in
a
kind
of
crude
way
most
of
the
time,
and
the
lawyer
looks
at
them
and
says,
well,
the
two
exhausted
claims
have
merit,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
merit
to
claims
3
and
4,
i
would
like
leave
to
amend
by
dismissing
those,
3
and
4,
should
the
judge
let
him
do
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
your
view,
i
thought
he
would
have
to
dismiss,
because
there
are
unexhausted
claims.
unknown
speaker
well,
nobody
would
be
hurt
much
by
your
rule.
if
that
is
the
rule,
he
will
never
put
an
exhausted
claim
in
his
first
petition.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
exactly.
well,
they
are
still
permitted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimmermann--
--they
still
are
permitted,
separate
and
independent--
--i
gather
the
rule
that
you
suggest
picard,
perhaps,
suggests,
that
is,
that
you
ought
not
let
the
state
prisoner
inside
the
federal
courthouse
door
if
he
has
federal
constitutional
claims
until
he
has
tendered
every
one
of
them
to
the
state
courts--
unknown
speaker
--first
to
decide.
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
rule
you
want.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
say
then
if
he
presents
one
claim
to
the
federal
court
after
having
exhausted
it,
and
then
later
comes
back
with
a
wholly
separate
claim,
which
he
has
now
exhausted,
that
the
federal
court
should
not
entertain
his
second
petition
at
all,
because
he
should
have
raised
it
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
that
situation
is
covered
by
the
statement
you
just
made.
either
present
them
all
at
once
or
that
is
all.
unknown
speaker
the
statutes
as
they
presently
are
do
not
require--
unknown
speaker
--and
our
cases
don't
support
your
suggested
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
suggesting
that
we
ought
to
decide
a
case
to
that
effect
so
that
they
can't
parlay
this
one
after
another.
unknown
speaker
mr.
assistant
attorney
general,
when
i
practiced
in
maryland
a
few
years
ago,
there
was
this
very
simple
way
of
handling
this.
any
state
judge
who
refused
to
entertain
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
went
to
the
penitentiary,
and
we
got
along
fine.
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
other
hand,
what
about
the
theory
that
you
give
each
prisoner
the
right
to
file
a
piece
of
paper,
which
says,
i
want
out
for
the
following
reasons,
and
put
them
all
down,
and
anything
that
he
doesn't
put
down,
they
are
gone.
isn't
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
this
paper
in
the
state
court.
that
that
is
the
end.
you
file
one
piece
of
paper,
and
that
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--so
far
as
habeas
corpus
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
he
can't
file
any
more.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
was
wondering
about.
well,
i
understood
your
answer
to
me,
mr.
zimmermann,
to
apply
only
to
a
situation
where
he
comes
into
the
federal
court
and
he
has,
as
you
say,
five
federal
claims
raised,
and
he
has
exhausted
only
one
of
them,
that
the
federal
judge,
even
though
that
one
had
been
exhausted
in
the
state
court,
you
are
suggesting
the
federal
judge
should
turn
him
away
until
he
goes
back
to
the
state
courts
for
the
other
four
and
gets
those
determined
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
prevent
his
coming
back
with
6,
7,
8,
and
9,
if
he
has
6,
7,
8,
and
9
later.
unknown
speaker
is
review
of
right
in
your
court
of
criminal
appeals?
unknown
speaker
do
your
federal
judges
in
tennessee
follow
the
practice
recently
developed
that
in
a
criminal
case
the
judge
instructs
counsel,
both
counsel
that
if
there
are
any
pretrial
motions,
they
will
all
be
made
by
a
given
date,
and
none
will
be
entertained
after
that
date
in
order
to
avoid
parlaying
them
and
delaying
the
trial?
do
they
follow
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
in
principle,
is
what
you
are
arguing
for
essentially
the
same
general
kind
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
all
of
his
claims
that
he
presents
in
his
petition.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimmermann,
let
me
ask
you
again
on
this
case,
assume
the
federal
judge,
as
apparently
this
judge
did,
thought
there
was
substance
to
the
two
exhausted
claims.
then
he
looked
at
the
other
two
claims,
as
they
are
here,
and
he
looks
at
those
and
says,
there
is
not
a
chance
in
the
world
any
judge
is
going
to
find
merit
to
the
claim
that
this
instruction
is
bad,
that
witnesses
are
generally
presumed
to
tell
the
truth,
that
that
somehow
is
a
constitutional
error.
he
nevertheless
under
your
rule
has
to
send
it
back
to
have
it
exhausted
even
though
he
thinks
it
is
a
perfectly
frivolous
claim?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
he
could
have
in
this
case,
under
your
approach,
dismissed
claims
3
and
4
as
being
on
their
face
without
merit--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
gone
ahead
on
1
and
2,
but
i
suppose
when
he
goes
ahead
on
1
and
2,
part
of
the
review
is
the
harmless
error
notion
in
your
appellate
court's
opinion,
and
in
reviewing
harmless
error,
i
guess
he
would
have
to
look
at
the
whole
record,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
one
of
your
complaints
is,
he
didn't
look
at
the
whole
record.
unknown
speaker
it
seemed
to
me
after
reading
the
state
court
opinions
that
his
chances
of
success
on
those
two
unexhausted
claims
were
about
one
in
nine
million.
isn't
that
all
the
more
reason
why
the
state
courts
should
be
allowed
to
deal
with
it
first?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
agree
with
me,
too,
on
his
possibilities?
0
[generallaughter.]
those
odds
are
pretty
heavy.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimmermann?
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
do
you
recall
the
dissent
in
that
case
by
judge
roney?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
of
the
rule
that
he
would
adopt?
in
essence,
as
i
recall,
he
would
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
state
courts
when
in
his
opinion
the
interests
of
justice
required
that
or
made
it
desirable,
but
if
the
district
court
went
ahead
and
decided
two
of
the
four
claims
that
you
have
been
talking
about,
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
duty-bound
to
review
those,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
picard
say
that?
didn't
picard
hold
that?
unknown
speaker
that
it
was
not
a
discretionary
rule?
i
thought
picard
held
that.
no?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
a
requirement,
period.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
you
have
to...
that
you
can't
review
the
exhausted
claims.
all
that
follows
from
that
is
that
the
claims
that
are
unexhausted,
you
cannot
adjudicate.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
the
rule
were
otherwise,
the
case
wouldn't
be
here.
unknown
speaker
at
least
six
or
seven
courts
of
appeals
are
against
you.
unknown
speaker
and
it
may
be
just
one
or
two
that
are
on
your
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
any
court
of
appeals
on
your
side
completely?
unknown
speaker
you
want
a
rule.
if
there
are
any
unexhausted
claims,
it
all
goes
back.
unknown
speaker
the
sixth
circuit
says,
in
its
opinion
which
you
are
seeking
to
overturn
here,
says
that
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
does
any
court
of
appeal,
if
a
habeas
petition
presents
one
exhausted
claim
and
one
unexhausted
claim,
does
any
court
of
appeals
say
that
the
district
court
may
hear
them
both,
on
the
theory
of
some
sort
of
a
pendant
claim?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
agree
with
him
on
the
flat
rule
he
wants,
though,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
then,
at
some
point,
i
take
it
you
will
deal
with
it.
what
is
a
federal
court
doing
with
a
case,
with
an
issue
which
has
not
been
exhausted,
no
matter
how
many
other
points
have
been
exhausted?
why
should
a
federal
court
be
in
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
in
his
corpus
case
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
reason
for
having
a
federal
district
judge
deal
with
an
issue
which
has...
on
which
no
relief
has
been
sought
in
the
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
overlooking
the
possibility
that
if
the
state
court
had
been
asked
to
deal
with
the
unexhausted
claim,
the
claim
that
was
never
presented,
there
might
be
no
case
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
a
very
real
possibility,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
smith,
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent,
and
that
is,
what
do
you
make
of
judge
morton's
comment
on
page
88
of
the
appendix
that
"since
grounds
3
and
4
have
not
been
presented
to
the
state
court
there
has
been
no
exhaustion
of
remedies
to
these
two.
"
"thus
this
court
will
not
consider
them
in
the
constitutional
framework.
"
"however,
in
assessing
the
atmosphere
of
the
cause
taken
as
a
whole,
these
item's
may
be
referred
to
collaterally?
"
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
consider,
certainly
in
his
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
a
great
deal
of
matter
that
would
be
subsumed
under
the
unexhausted
claims,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
without
them,
then
he
may
not
have
granted
relief.
unknown
speaker
that
really
means
that
they
are
inseparable,
and
that
the
whole
thing
should
have
been
exhausted.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
means
we
throw
away
picard
then.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
his
findings
and
conclusions
strike
you
a
little
bit
like
the
lines
that,
"julia,
saying
she'd
never
consent,
consented?
"
unknown
speaker
sometimes
busy
district
judges
don't
have
time
to
write
opinions
as
carefully
as
possible
and
your
friend
wants
to
give
them
more
time
by
taking
these
cases
away.
unknown
speaker
do
we
know,
mr.
smith,
when
the
state
courts
considered
and
decided
the
two
exhausted
claims,
did
they
consider
them
in
the
context
of
the
gloss
put
on
by
the
other
two
claims?
do
we
know
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
were
you
in
the
case
then,
mr.
smith?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
whether
they
considered
them
with
the
gloss
of
the
other
two?
unknown
speaker
inescapably,
you've
got
two
different
courts,
two
different
jurisdictions
dealing
with
the
same
general
set
of
complaints.
unknown
speaker
not
in
a
hierarchy
of
review
court,
but
in
effect
the
district
court
becomes
a
reviewing
court--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
were
they
preserved
at
the
trial,
objections,
appropriate
objections?
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
two
faults.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
you
do
recognize
that
the
district
judge
relied
to
some
extent
on
the
unexhausted
matters,
to
some
extent
anyway.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
you
said
in
answer
to
my
question
that
perhaps
without
them
he
might
not
have
granted
relief,
and
if
that
is
true,
if
he
presents
the
whole
ball
of
wax
to
the
state
court
again,
perhaps
the
state
court
would
grant
him
relief
now
that
they
wouldn't
have
on
his
exhausted
claims
alone.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
he
wasn't
making
these
particular
claims.
unknown
speaker
which
he
did
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
at
least
you
didn't
mean
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
rather
persuasive
reason
to
require
them
to
be
put
all
in
one
bag
and
delivered
to
one
court
at
one
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
logical
reason
why
we
shouldn't
have
that
"nice
way"?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
"this
court",
you
mean
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
and
in
connection
with
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
unknown
speaker
right,
or
he
read
something
in
the
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
so
the
form
is
a
trap.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
present
every
claim
that
you
have
already
presented
to
a
state
court.
unknown
speaker
you
are
aware,
i
am
sure,
that
there
are
districts
in
which
there
are
litigants
of
this
category
who
have
filed
50,
75,
100,
or
several
hundred
petitions
seriatim
over
a
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
each
one
of
which
had
to
be
separately
dealt
with
by
a
federal
district
judge.
unknown
speaker
and
that
claim
was
exhausted.
