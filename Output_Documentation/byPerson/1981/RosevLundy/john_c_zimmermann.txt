mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
tennessee
seeks
review
in
this
case
of
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
sixth
circuit
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
which
granted
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
noah
lundy,
ordering
that
he
be
released
from
his
sentence
unless
he
was
retried
within
90
days.
following
his
direct
appeal
in
which
his
convictions
for
rape
and
crime
against
nature
were
affirmed,
mr.
lundy
sought
state
petition
for
post-conviction
relief,
and
it
was
denied
in
the
state
court.
no
appeal
was
taken.
then,
later,
he
petitioned
for
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
four
constitutional
claims.
the
first
two
claims
had
been
presented
to
the
state
courts.
the
second
two
claims
had
never
been
presented
to
any
state
court.
in
our
answer,
the
state
of
tennessee
objected
to
the
review
of
the
petition
in
the
district
court
on
the
ground
that
mr.
lundy
had
not
exhausted
all
his
claims
in
available
state
remedies,
he
had
not
presented
all
his
claims
to
the
state
courts,
and
therefore,
the
court,
in
accordance
with
the
exhaustion
requirement,
should
dismiss
his
habeas
petition
until
such
time
as
the
state
conviction
and
all
the
federal
constitutional
claims
which
mr.
lundy
sought
to
raise
were
adjudicated
finally
and
completely
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
your
honor,
his
statement
there,
i
think,
presents
to
this
court
and
illustrates
to
this
court
how
it
is
difficult
for
a
federal
court
to
separate
the
exhaustive
and
unexhaustive
claims
from
habeas
review,
which
frustrates
the
exhaustion
requirement.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
he
correctly
noted,
in
accordance
with
our
contention,
that
claims
3
and
4
had
never
been
presented
to
the
state
court.
and
here
he
said
that
he
would
not
consider
them
in
the
constitutional
framework.
however,
he
later
says
in
his
opinion
that
the
four
claims
were...
constituted
such
a
mixture
of
constitutional
violations
that
they
could
not
be
separated
one
from
another.
he
relied
not
only
upon
claim
number
4,
which
was
the
instruction
issue,
but
also
the
statement
of
the
prosecutor
set
forth
in
claim
number
3,
which
had
never
been
presented
to
the
state
courts.
he
used
those
to
illustrate
how
mr.
lundy
had
been
denied
his
right
to
due
process
of
law,
together
with
the
first
two
claims.
not
only
did
he
do
that,
but
he
saw
numerous
others,
a
litany,
actually,
of
statements
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
that
had
never
been
presented
in
the
petition,
many
of
which
had
never
been
presented
to
the
state
courts.
he
took
this
litany
of
remarks
by
the
state
prosecutor
and
said,
look
at
all
these
remarks.
i
find
possible
misconduct,
and
i
find
because
of
all
this,
because
of
all
these
remarks,
he
is
entitled
to
habeas
relief.
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
require
that
in
cases
like
this,
that
a
state
prisoner
proceed
first
all
through
the
state
courts,
take
all
his
federal
constitutional
claims
before
he
goes
to
the
federal
courts,
because,
you
see,
in
this
case
many
of
the
constitutional
claims,
or
many
of
the
remarks
which
judge
morton,
the
district
judge,
found
to
be
constitutionally
defective,
we
submit,
have
been
waived
under
state
law.
no
objection
had
been
made
as
required
by
state
evidentiary
rules,
procedural
rules,
and
therefore,
if
the
whole
case
and
all
the
constitutional
claims
had
been
given
to
the
state
courts,
our
courts
could
have
conducted
whatever
evidentiary
hearings
were
necessary,
they
could
have
made--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--precisely,
your
honor.
the
problem
here
is,
the
claims
of
prosecutorial
misconduct...
it
was
a
different
claim
in
the
federal
court
from
what
it
was
in
the
state
court.
the
identity
of
the
claim,
if
you
please,
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
was
twofold
in
the
state
courts:
number
one,
whether
or
not
this
remark
of
mr.
lundy's
violent
character
was
constitutionally
defective,
and
number
two,
in
the
state
court,
mr.
lundy
alleged,
that
the
prosecutors
had
made
disparaging
remarks
about
his
lawyer.
now,
those
were
the
only
two
acts
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
presented
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
well,
it
is
a
due
process
claim,
essentially.
it
could
be
other
claims,
such
as
a
fifth
amendment
violation,
where
a
prosecutor
comments
upon
a
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand,
or
it
could
trigger
other
constitutional
rights,
but
under
donnelly
it
is
a
due
process
analysis.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
teaching
under
picard
v.
connor
is
this.
give
the
state
courts
fair
notice
of
what
your
constitutional
complaint
is,
your
federal
constitutional
complaint
is.
tell
them
what
your
complaint
is.
and
that
claim
itself
can
be
brought
over
to
the
federal
courts,
because
then
you
have
identified
a
specific
constitutional
violation,
not
requiring,
of
course,
to
cite
book,
chapter,
and
verse,
but
you
have
given
the
courts,
state
courts
fair
notice
of
what
your
complaint
is.
now,
the
lower
federal
courts,
for
example,
have
found
such
claims
as
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
to
constitute
different
identity
of
claims,
such
as,
there
might
be
a
conflict
of
interest
in
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
where
a
lawyer
represented
two
defendants.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
yes,
your
honor,
he
should
dismiss
it
and
send
it--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--the
prisoner...
exactly.
remand
the
entire
case
back
to
the--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--well,
you
are
remanding
a
case.
you
have
to
understand,
your
honor,
that
we
are
submitting
you
are
looking
at
a
case
on
collateral
review,
and
many
claims,
many
constitutional
claims--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--well,
what
we
are
trying
to...
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
say
is
this.
if
he
brings
the
two
claims,
one
is
exhausted
and
one
is
not,
he
is
still
going
to
get
prompt
review
of
his
federal
constitutional
claims,
if
he
is
asked
or
sent
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts,
because
the--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--well,
he
is
going
to
get
prompt
review
on
the
second
one,
and
the
state
courts
could
grant
relief,
could
discharge
him
from
custody,
give
him
a
new
trial.
but
even
more
so,
your
honor,
many
times
constitutional
claims
can
be
deemed
harmless--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--well,
i
would
only
say
dismiss
it
because
that
is
what
the
precedents
of
this
court
say,
when
there
has
been
non-compliance
with
the
exhaustion
requirements.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
exactly,
your
honor.
exactly.
but
he
is
not
prejudiced.
whether
you
call
it
dismissal
or
whether
you
say
we
are
just
going
to
defer
ruling
on
the
whole
case,
what
we
are
trying
to
ask
the
court
to
do
is
say,
look,
in
federal
courts
you
review
a
state
conviction
one
time.
bring
all
your
federal
claims
to
federal
court
one
time.
of
course,
there
is
protection--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--i
think
the
judge
ought
to
let
him
do
it,
if
what
has
happened--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--well,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
where
they
have
this
rule
requiring
complete
exhaustion,
the
district
judges
take
careful...
take
careful
pains,
extra
pains
to
make
sure
the
prisoner
knows
that
you
might
be
barred
from
subsequent
habeas
litigation
in
federal
courts.
if
the
state
prisoner
says,
no,
these
are
frivolous
claims,
or
no,
these
don't
have
any
merit
whatsoever,
for
one
reason
or
another,
if
he
takes
his
chances
with
his
exhausted
claims,
he
is
in
effect
saying,
this
is
it.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that's
correct.
and
then
the
federal
courts
would
have
to,
if
there
was
a
second
petition--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
federal
door
of
habeas
review
ought
to
be
shut.
not
at
all.
we
defend
the
writ.
we
support
it.
what
we
want
is
that
the
state
courts
have
the
first
opportunity
to
finally
decide
his
criminal
conviction
under
federal--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--well,
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
that
would
be
governed
by
rule
9.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
a
federal
district
judge
could
find
there
had
been
abuse
of
the
writ
by
successive
petition,
or
he
could
find--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
but
here
in
this
case--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--exactly,
your
honor.
what
we
are
having
now
is
that
under
the
present
situation
where
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
decided,
the
state
courts
in
particular
in
this
case,
should
lundy...
the
granting
of
the
writ
be
reversed,
what
we
are
being
called
upon
to
do
is
to
litigate
and
relitigate,
and
a
federal
judge
many
times
having
to
look
at
the
same
transcript
not
once
or
twice,
but
three
times,
and
this
is
particularly
aggravated
or
made
acute
following
the
decision
in
jackson
v.
virginia,
a
very
common...
a
very
common
claim
for
relief
is
sufficiency
of
evidence
in
the
state
courts,
and
now
it
is
being
more
commonly
made
in
the
federal
courts.
and
you
take
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
let's
say,
and
a
claim
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
assuming
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
has
never
been
raised,
and
the
federal
judge
has
to
look
at
this
multi-volume
transcript
to
determine
all
these
issues
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
then--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--your
honor,
i
think
tennessee's
record,
the
state
courts
in
tennessee's
record
clearly
establishes
that
we
are
very
receptive
and
attentive
to
federal
constitutional
claims.
in
fact,
after
fay
v.
noia--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--no,
your
honor.
it
is
different.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
because
that
is
a
rule
9
problem.
what
we
are
saying
is,
if
he
puts
down
on
that
piece
of
paper
five
claims,
and
he
thinks,
i've
got
five
complaints
about
the
way
my
trial
was
run,
and
he
has
identified
them--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--but
he
has
only
taken
one
to
the
state
courts,
what
we
are
saying
is,
go
back
to
the
state--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--in
the
state.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
if
he
files
one
piece
of
paper
in
the
state
courts
and
takes
that
one--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--not
in
tennessee.
in
tennessee,
he
can
file
petitions
for
post-conviction
or
leave--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--one
after
another.
they
have
no
rule
9
bar.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that
is
our
position,
and
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that's
correct.
what
we
are
just
saying
is,
if
he
knows
on
the
front
end
that
he
has
got
five
complaints,
some
of
which
are
not
exhausted,
send
him
back
to
federal
court...
rather,
send
him
back
to
the
state
court.
if
a
hearing
is
required,
we
will
conduct
a
hearing.
the
record
of
tennessee
speaks
for
itself.
we
have
reversed
numerous
cases
on
federal
constitutional
grounds,
and
our
post-conviction
procedure
is
more
liberal,
grants
more
rights
to
a
prisoner
than
federal
collateral
review,
for
this
reason.
not
only
do
we
review
federal
constitutional
claims,
but
also
state
constitutional
claims,
at
a
time
when
our
supreme
court
is
considering
some
rights
for
criminal
defendants
more
broadly
than
the
federal
counterpart.
so,
you
see,
sending
him
back
to
the
state
courts
is
not
taking
anything
away
from
him.
it
is
telling
him,
look,
let
the
state
finally
review
your
conviction.
there
has
got
to
be
some
finality.
and
when
a
federal
court
looks
at
a
criminal
conviction,
a
state
criminal
proceeding,
we
have
got
to
know
the
states
have
looked
at
it
all
and
said
their
last
word,
and
in
this
case
the
claim
of
prosecutorial
misconduct,
i
believe
the
record
could
have
been
more
certain
as
to
which
claims
could
have
been
reviewed,
which
remarks
could
have
been
reviewed
by
the
federal
court,
particularly
after
wainwright
v.
sykes.
if
our
court
had
only
had
the
opportunity
to
look
at
some
of
these
claims,
some
of
these
remarks
that
judge
morton
relied
upon
in
granting
habeas
relief,
if
our
state
courts
could
have
looked
at
it,
we
could
have
either
said,
this
is
bad,
we
are
going
to
grant
this
man
a
new
trial,
or
if
they
could
have
said,
these
remarks
and
claims
concerning
these
remarks
are
barred
because
of
procedural
default,
and
absent
a
showing
of
cause
and
prejudice,
there
would
have
been
no
federal
habeas
review
whatsoever.
not
only
would
a
rule
as
we
espouse
today
cut
down
the
work
load,
i
say,
or
make
the
haystack
smaller
when
searching
for
the
needle
of
the
meritorious
habeas
petitioner,
but
asking
the
man,
the
prisoner
to
go
back
to
state
courts
for
his
federal
constitutional
claims
also
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
write
definitive
state
rulings,
controlling
state
rulings
to
our
lower
court
judges
because,
you
see,
decisions
of
federal
district
courts
in
tennessee,
and
courts
of
appeals
are
not
binding
on
our
state
trial
courts.
they
are
persuasive
authority,
but
they
are
not
binding,
but
the
decisions
of
our
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals,
if
they
decided
the
constitutional
claims,
our
own
state
trial
courts
would
be
instructed
by
them,
and
guided
by
their
decisions.
so,
you
see,
the
ultimate
relief,
the
ultimate
remedy
to
bring
state
trial
courts
and
cause
them
to
correctly
decide
federal
constitutional
claims
would
be--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--yes,
your
honor.
there
is
an
appeal
of
right
in
our
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals,
permissive
review
in
the
tennessee
supreme
court.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
yes,
your
honor.
i
suppose
the
kind
of
rule
we
are
asking
for
is,
there
ought
to
be
a
stage
of
habeas
analysis
before
we
even
look
at
the
merits
of
each
claim,
and
first,
has
he
exhausted
all
his
claims,
and
if
he
has,
are
any
of
them
barred,
and
if
he--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that's
correct.
it
is
up
to
the
prisoner
which
claims
he
puts
in
his
petition,
and
we
have
no
control
over
that.
but
the
point,
the
point
is
this,
that
the
federal
courts,
at
this
point,
anyway,
are
looking
at
each
individual
claim,
deciding
these
sometimes
complex
exhaustion
questions
on
each
individual
claim
before
they
start
looking
at
the
merits,
and
what
is
happening
is
this,
and
the
scholars
have
pointed
this
out.
the
federal
judges
would
rather
jump
over
to
the
merits,
look
at
the
merits,
particularly
if
it
is
rather
cut
and
dry,
and
say,
deny
relief
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
well,
not
precisely,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
reason
why.
if
a
federal
district
judge
looked
at
a
habeas
petition,
pro
se
litigants
filed
it,
and
he
sees
1
and
2
have
been
exhausted,
but
3
and
4
are
so
frivolous,
they
don't
even
state
habeas
claims
for
relief--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--the
rules
require
him
to
dismiss
those
outright,
strike
those,
and
only
consider
the
claims...
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
on
the
front
end,
before
we
even
look
at
exhaustion,
the
rules
of
procedure
contemplate
that
the
federal
district
judge
will
say,
does
any
of
this
state
a
cognizable
habeas
claim
before
i
order
the
state,
before
i
order
the
state
to
answer?
now,
that
is
what
a
federal
judge--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--yes,
your
honor,
under--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
well,
that
was
a
matter
that
we
were
concerned
about,
that's
true
but
we
submitted
under
the
record
that
he
had,
he
didn't
need
the
entire
record
in
order
to
deny
habeas
relief,
but
if
the
federal...
if
judge
morton
saw...
i
think
there
may
be
something
there,
i
want
to
see
the
whole
record,
he
could
have
ordered
it
to
be
expanded,
but
under
this
case,
because
of
the
many
remarks
relied
upon
by
judge
morton
to
grant
habeas
relief,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
he
said
himself,
these
claims
are
so
inseparable,
they
are
such
a
mixture,
i
can't
separate
them,
this
case
should
have
been
sent
back
to
the
state
courts
for
them
to
look
at
these
unexhausted
claims,
because,
you
see,
our
own
state
courts
are
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
same
record
again,
and
if...
and
if,
under
the
present
analysis
by
most
of
the
federal
circuits,
if
lundy
loses...
let's
say
he
lost
in
the
district
court
on
the
two
exhausted
claims,
but
he
appealed,
and
while
at
the
same
time
he
appealed
he
comes
over
to
our
state
courts
and
said,
here
is
my
unexhausted
claims,
look
at
them,
well,
i
would
submit
that
perhaps
our
state
courts
would
probably
abstain
from
ruling
on
the
unexhausted
claims
until
there
is
a
final
decision
on
the
exhausted
claims.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
on
that.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
well,
your
honor,
let
me
be...
let
me
say
this.
there
is
no
question
that
not
all
the
claims
were
given
at
the
state
courts.
secondly,
there
is
no
question
that
the
proof
in
this
case
was
undisputed.
lundy
never
took
the
stand.
he
never
offered
any
defense.
and
the
state
courts
said,
this
overwhelming
evidence...
here
you
had
a
rape
case
where
there
was
an
eye
witness
present,
not
only
the
rape
victim,
but
an
eye
witness,
and
all
this
evidence,
including
the
defendant's
own
post-arrest
statement,
all
this
evidence,
they
said,
this
is
overwhelming,
and
for
this
reason
we
find
these
two
little...
two
remarks
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
he
harmless.
they
weren't
given
the
opportunity
to
look
at
pervasive
prosecutorial
misconduct
as
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
in
state
v.
hicks
this
year,
where
they
struck
down
and
overruled
a
defendant's
conviction
because
of
pervasive
prosecutorial
misconduct,
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
that
case
merely
illustrates
to
the
court
how
they
conduct
their
analysis
under
state
law
in
applying
federal
constitutional
rights
of
due
process
with
regard
to
prosecutorial
misconduct.
whether
or
not
he
has
any
chance
at
all,
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
this,
that
if
he
goes
to
the
state
court,
and
the
state
court
says
he
has
waived
all
these
things,
he
is
barred
from
raising
them,
then
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
those
rulings
by
the
state
courts
would
be
definitive
and
determinative
on
whether
or
not
habeas
review
could
even
occur
later
in
federal
court.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
well,
i
believe
his
opinion
is
based
upon
a
notion
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
nothing
more
than
a
discretion
to
be
applied
at
the
discretion,
if
you
please,
of
the
district
court,
and
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
exhaustion
requirement,
we
submit,
operates
as
a
prerequisite
to
habeas
review,
a
precondition
to
habeas
review.
it
has
never
been,
since
1948,
anyway,
a
discretionary
tool.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
i
don't
recall--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that
it
was
not
a
discretionary--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that
is
correct,
and
so
did
pitches
v.
davies,
said
it
was
a
prerequisite
to
habeas--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that
is
correct,
but
you
see--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--well--
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
--that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
well,
they
are
on
our
side
partially.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
what
the
circuit
courts
are
laboring
under
is
a
misunderstanding
that
habeas
review,
that
there
is
somehow
something
that
requires
immediate
and
prompt
habeas
review
of
a
prisoner's
claim,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
you
can't
just
break
a
conviction
off
in
little
bits
and
pieces,
and
say,
have
a
little
bit
now
and
a
little
bit
later
and
come
back
through
the
revolving
door
again
two
years
later,
and
a
little
bit
more.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that's
correct.
that
could
be
easily
applied
not
only
by
the
district
judges
and
magistrates,
but
also
by
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
that's
correct.
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
agree
with
us
with
regard
to
how
a
district
court
ought
to
apply
it,
but
in
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuits,
they
say
on
appeal
if
the
district
judge
erroneously
looks
at
the
exhaustion
claims,
we
will
look
at
the
exhaustion
claims,
too,
and
we
don't
believe
that
a
court
of
appeals
should
do
that,
any
more
than
this
court
has
looked
at,
for
judicial
economy
purposes,
an
unexhausted
claim.
this
court
has
consistently
and
repeatedly
said
it
doesn't
matter
if
everyone
is
granted
relief,
it
doesn't
matter
if
this
issue
is
of
great
national
importance,
if
it
hasn't
been
exhausted,
you
go
back
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
i
am
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
zimmermann
no,
your
honor.
