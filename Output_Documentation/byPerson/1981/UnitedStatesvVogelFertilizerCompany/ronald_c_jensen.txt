mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
the
issue
in
this
case
can
be
very
simply
stated.
must
vogel
fertilizer
company
be
considered
a
member
of
a
brother-sister
controlled
group
under
the
specific
definition
and
the
specific
statutory
language
of
that
term,
as
provided
by
congress?
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
the
specific
origin
of
the
brother-sister
i'm
not
sure.
i
assume
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
you
have
two
corporations
side
by
side
as
opposed
to
a
parent
subsidiary.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
one's
a
brother
and
the
other's
a
sister.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
i
could
not
tell
you
the
gender.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
the
term
is
right
in
the
statute
itself.
both
the
parent
subsidiary
term
and
the
brother-sister
terms
are
there.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
where?
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
perhaps
it
did
come
from
that.
that's
right.
or
some
more
obscure
relationship.
your
honors,
it
appears
that
the
sharpest
division
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer
comes
in
defining
the
functions
and
the
interactions
of
the
80
%
and
the
50
%
tests,
and
how
these
functions
advance
the
design
of
the
statute.
now,
if
i
may
just
reiterate
and
summarize
for
you
what
i
believe
the
differences
are,
i
think
this
would
help
very
much.
the
taxpayer's
interpretation,
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
as
follows.
we
apply
the
80
%
test
first,
and
that
follows
from
words
located
in
the
statute,
if
for
no
other
reason.
and
the
80
%
test
is
a
test
of
financial
interest.
this
test
is
designed
to
require
an
aggregate
ownership
representing
substantially
the
entire
financial
interest
in
all
the
corporations
involved.
this
is
where
we
get
to
the
economic
entity
idea.
we
are
trying
to
find
the
entire
financial
interest.
now,
why
is
a
financial
interest
necessary?
it's
necessary
because
the
conduct
sanctioned
by
this
particular
statute
is
the
exercise
of
control
over
more
than
one
corporation
by
a
small
group
of
persons
for
their
own
substantial
financial
interest
in
the
corporations.
with
this
function,
commonality
is
required.
now,
the
50
%
test,
i
believe
that
both
the
government
and
myself
agree,
is
one
of
control.
it
identifies
the
degree
of
control
necessary
to
allow
the
corporations
to
be
operated
as
one
economic
entity.
now,
we
believe
that
our
interpretation
of
the
particular
statute
gives
both
tests
a
separate
and
distinct
function.
the
government,
on
the
other
hand,
interprets
the
statute
in
such
a
manner
that
both
of
the
tests,
the
80
%
and
the
50
%
tests,
are
tests
of
control.
the
50
%
test,
which
they
would
apply
first,
determines
whether
the
corporations
have
a
commonality
of
control
through
common
stockholders.
we
don't
really
have
any
argument
with
that
particular
definition.
but
their
80
%
test
ensures
only
that
the
stock
is
closely
held.
the
exemption
is
saved
under
their
interpretation
if
there
are
shareholders
outside
the
50
%
five
or
fewer
group
that
own
more
than
20
%
of
its
stock.
now,
i
would
submit
that
under
the
government's
interpretation,
1563
as
a
scheme
wherein
the
80
%
test
has
no
separate
meaning
by
itself
and
is
redundant.
if
congress
had
meant
and
intended
both
tests
to
be
tests
of
control,
what
does
80
%
add
that
50
%
doesn't
already
have?
you
can
control
a
corporation
with
both
of
those
items.
congress
must
meant
more
than
this.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
with
either
you
can
control,
yes,
that's
correct.
congress
must
have
meant
the
80
%
test
to
mean
more
than
this,
and
it
does
mean
more
than
this
if
it
is
given
a
financial
interest
function.
again,
a
financial
interest
test
is
necessary
because
of
the
conduct
the
statute
is
meant
to
be
reached,
and
that's--
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
--not
necessarily
just
one
person,
but
if
any...
you
have
to
have
commonality
among
the
five.
to
count
one
person's
stock
in
a
corporation,
he
has
to
own
stock
in
both
corporations.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
how,
in
our
particular
case
with
the
77
%
and
23
%,
you
cannot
count,
we
say,
the
23
%
because
mr.
crain
does
not
own
any
stock
in
the
second
corporation.
therefore,
he
only
has
77
%
in
the
first
corporation;
no
brother-sister
group.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
even
though
there
is
87
%
in
popcorn.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
my
answer
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
100
%
in
popcorn.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
that's
right,
you
have
to
meet
the
80
%
test
first
and
then
go
to
the
50
%
test.
you
have
to
meet
both.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
the
80
%
test?
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
they
are
both
tests
of
overlapping
interests,
but
they
are
separate
tests
in
that
the--
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
--well,
that
is
correct,
you
can
fail
one
test
or
the
other;
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean--
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
--mr.
vogel?
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
if
he
had
80
%
in
both,
then
he
would
meet
both
tests.
even
under
our
position,
he
would
meet
both
tests.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
well,
this
is
the
arbitrary
line
congress
has
picked
in
their
own
wisdom,
and
if
80
%
is
80
%
in
the
test,
then
80
%
meets
the
rule.
that
just
follows.
but
79
%
is
not
80
%.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
we
were
counsel,
but
we
did
not
prepare
the
returns
in
question.
that
was
done
by
the--
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
shows
effective
tax
planning
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer.
when
you
have
a
regulation
out
there
with
no
authority
to
the
contrary,
i
think
you
are
well
advised
to
follow
the
regulation
in
most
cases.
but
as
soon
as
you
have
some
authority
to
the
contrary,
it
is
more
than
proper
to
take
a
position
that
the
regulation
is
not
a
correct
implication
of
congress's
intent.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
well,
just
from
knowing
the
people
who
prepared
the
tax
returns,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
although
this
is
not
a
matter
of
the
facts...
that
they
are
conservative
tax
planners,
and
they
would
follow
the
unless
there
was
regulation
authority
to
do
otherwise.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
definitely,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
no,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
and
we
are
also
talking
about
a
large
amount
of
taxes.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
no,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
and
we
also
have
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
i
believe
the
court
of
claims
expanded
somewhat
on
the
fairfax
decision,
the
original
fairfax
decision,
but
as
a
whole,
they
follow
along
the
same
line.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
yes.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
yes,
that's
where
that
analysis
first
came
to
rise,
is
in
the
fairfax
case.
they
first
decided
that
particular
way.
your
honors,
it
is
felt
that
the
court
of
claims
was
correct
in
finding
that
by
addition
of
the
phrase
"singly
or
in
combination"
to
the
statutory
language,
singly
or
in,
otherwise
identically
traced
by
the
regulation,
the
government
has
expanded
the
scope--
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
--it
was
ultimately
reviewed
by
the
court.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
there
was
a
division
of
the
tax
court
from
time
to
time.
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
i
can
tell
you--
mr.
ronald
c.
jensen
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
first
decision
was
a
different
division
than
a
later
decision
by
the
tax
court
in
below
or
in
one
of
the
other
tax
court
cases.
i
think
it
was...
we,
of
course,
were
always
in
the
majority
with
the
tax
court,
but
there
was
always
a
split
between
the
judges.
if
i
remember
right,
in
fairfax
i
think
there
were
three
in
the
first
dissent.
are
there
anymore
questions?
thank
you.
