unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
what
do
you
think
the
reasoning
behind
the
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
cartwright
was,
where
it
struck
down
a
treasury
regulation.
unknown
speaker
maybe
your
reading
of
the
statute...
the
court
of
claims'
reading
of
the
statute...
would
make
more
sense
than
congress
made,
but
how
do
you
get
away
from
the
80
%?
unknown
speaker
does
vogel
own
80
%
in
each?
unknown
speaker
if
you
add
those
two
together
and
divide
by
two,
then
you
do
have
80...
is
that
the
way
it's
supposed
to
work?
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
mention
that
crain
owns
nothing
of
popcorn.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that's
wholly
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
it's
wholly
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
smith.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
smith,
if
i
may.
with
the
80
%
rule
in
the
statute
itself,
doesn't...
isn't
that
made
almost
superfluous
by
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
so
crain
is,
in
effect,
drawn
into
the
net
by
his
interest
in
vogel.
unknown
speaker
a
and
b
are
conjunctive,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
a
and
b
of
this--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
do
have
to
subsist
together.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
have
to
have
the
two
to
satisfy
a.
and
you
have
two
here,
you
say,
to
satisfy
a.
unknown
speaker
but
only
one
that
satisfies
b.
unknown
speaker
and
what
are
the
two,
to
be
precise,
that
satisfy
a?
unknown
speaker
and
77
or
whatever
it
is--
unknown
speaker
--i
know,
because
as
you
say,
77
plus
22
is
100,
so
that's
more
than
80.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
only
owned
40
%
of
popcorn,
the
statute
would
not
be
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
account
for
the
word
"and"
between
a
and
b
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
the
court
of
claims
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it's
not
hard
for
an
ordinary
person
to
convolute
the
internal
revenue
code.
unknown
speaker
when
we're
construing
a
statute
of
this
kind
we...
must
the
courts
construe
it
most
strictly
against
the
taxpayer
or
most
strictly
against--
unknown
speaker
let
me
simply
say
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
our
view,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
supports
the
commissioner's
interpretation.
--even
if
it
was
ambiguous,
there
is
some
rule
that
you
pay
some
deference
to
the
commissioner's--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
convolute.
what
do
you
mean
by
convolute?
unknown
speaker
and
how
old
is
that
regulation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
before
lunch
i
think
you
started
your
argument
by
saying
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
prevent
the
split-up
of
a
single
economic
entity
or
enterprise.
what
is
a
single
economic
entity
or
enterprise
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
in
economic
terms?
unknown
speaker
the
popcorn
business
or
the
fertilizer
business?
unknown
speaker
isn't
a
fair
way
to
state
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
five
or
fewer
of
fewer
persons
referred
to
in
the
statute
have
to
be
the
same
persons
for
both
a
and
b?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
only
one
mention
of
five
or
fewer
persons
that
applies
to
both
a
and
b,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
but
referring
to
different
groups
of
five
or
fewer--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
smith,
what
can
crain
do
to
get
out
from
under
this?
unknown
speaker
he
doesn't
own
any
of
the
stock,
popcorn
stock,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
do
wrong?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
that
crain
did
that
congress
tried
to
stop
him
from
doing?
unknown
speaker
well,
another
way
if
you
don't
want
to
answer
the
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
assuming
i
think
it
might
help
it.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
only
one,
that's
fertilizer.
unknown
speaker
well
following
up
on
justice
marshall's
thought,
supposing
originally
crain
owned
this
interest
in
the
company
in
which
mr.
x
owned
the
other
77
%.
and
then
he'd
have
the
full
exemption.
then
mr.
x
sells
out
to
mr.
vogel
and
mr.
crain
loses
a
big
part
of
his
exemption.
unknown
speaker
does
the
court
of
claims
and
the
tax
court
hold
that
each
one
of
the
five
has
to
be
an
owner
in
each
of
the
corporations?
unknown
speaker
would
that
make
the
50
%
requirement
superfluous?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
if
each
of
the
five
have
to...
if
each
of
the
five
have
to
own--
unknown
speaker
--no,
not
identical
amounts.
but
if
all
five
of
them
have
to
own
something
in,
say,
popcorn,
and
if
they
all
add
up
to
80
%,
then
certainly--
unknown
speaker
--well,
isn't
that
the
result
of
it?
in
any
case.
if
each
of
them,
if
all
five
have
to
own
some
shares
in
both...
in
all
the
corporations,
if
each
of
the
five
has
to
own--
unknown
speaker
--and
certainly
in
one
of
them;
say
in
popcorn,
the
five
would
have
to
own
over
80
%
to
satisfy
that
test,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
80
%
test.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's
what
the
result
is.
in
any
case,
under
their
rationale
that
you
satisfy
the
80
%
test,
you
would
always
satisfy
the
50
%.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
true.
if
you
have
a
owning
80
%
and
b
20
%
in
one,
and
vice
versa
in
the
other,
you
wouldn't
meet
the
50
%
test.
why?
mr.
smith
will
explain
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
that's
because
of
the
provision
that--
unknown
speaker
--the
lowest
amount.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
if
they
own
the
same
amounts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you
a
little
bit
about,
or
have
you
explain
to
me
a
little
about
the
legislative
history.
i
guess
the
section
was
originally
enacted
in
1964
as
just
an
80
%
test.
unknown
speaker
without
the
50
%
requirement.
unknown
speaker
from
one
to
five.
but
didn't
change
the
other
language
of
subsection
a,
which
would
indicate
that
the
common
ownership
was
required?
unknown
speaker
would
you
concede
that
originally,
as
the
statute
was
originally
drafted,
that
in
effect
the
80
%
requirement
was
a
common
ownership
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
subsection
a
did
not
change
other
than
to
say
expand
from
one
to
five,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
at
page
6
of
your
brief
in
the
second
full
paragraph
in
the
summary
of
argument
you
say,
"congress
sought
to
provide
an
objective
mathematical
test
to
eliminate
income
splitting
among
corporations,
operated
as
one
economic
entity.
"
doesn't
that
make
the
court
of
claims,
concession
that
if
smith
had
owned
one
share
in
popcorn...
fit
in
with
that?
it's
a
mathematical
test?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
every
test
like
this
can
turn
on
one
share
being
in
somebody
else's
hands,
can't
it,
no
matter
where
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jensen,
where
does
this
brother-sister
terminology
come
from?
unknown
speaker
so
one's
brother
and
the
other
sister?
unknown
speaker
which
is
which?
unknown
speaker
the
dominant
one
is
the
female--
--perhaps
they
should
all
be
gender
and
neutral.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
term
right
in
the
statute
itself?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
it
came
from
a
case
in
which
there
happened
to
be
a
brother
and
a
sister
embarking
on
this
kind
of
a
program.
unknown
speaker
i
said
perhaps
it
came
from
such
a
case.
unknown
speaker
with
either
you
can
control.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
if
one
person
does
not
own
80
%
or
more
in
each
corporation,
you
never
get
to
the
8
part
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
less
than
80
%
in
either
one
of
the
corporations,
you
never
get
to
b.
unknown
speaker
even
though
there
is
87
%
in
popcorn.
unknown
speaker
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
it
was
100
%
in
popcorn?
unknown
speaker
but
you
must
concede
that
congress
that
this
rule
they
are
imposing
wouldn't
be
triggered
until
the
80
%
requirement
is
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
so
it
does
add
something
to
the
50
%.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
necessarily
satisfy
the
80
%
requirement
just
because
you
satisfied
the
50
%
requirement.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
jensen,
suppose
he
had
80
%
in
both.
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
then
what?
would
that
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
i
gather,
mr.
jensen,
that
if
he
had
80
%
or
85
%
in
fertilizer
and
only
77
%
in
popcorn,
the
fact
that
the
other
chap
had
22
%
in
popcorn
wouldn't
satisfy
the
test.
unknown
speaker
because
he
would
have
also
to
have
some
stock
in
fertilizer
before--
--that's
right,
before
his
stock
could
be
counted
at
all.
now,
if
i
might
present
an
example,
i
think
that
this
will
bring
the
unreasonableness
of
the
government's
80
%
test
in
view.
let's
suppose
that
one
of
you
owns
70
%
of
corporation
number
one,
in
which
i
own
30
%.
tax
time
rolls
around.
of
course,
the
tax
court,
as
you
probably
already
well
know,
says
that
there
is
a
surprise
visited
upon
me,
and
perhaps
upon
you,
in
that
the
surtax
exemption
is
lost
or
is
at
least
shared
if
you,
all
of
sudden,
i
all
of
a
sudden
find
out,
that
you
own
not
just
one
other
corporation
as
the
tax
court
says,
but
four
other
corporations.
and
let's
assume
that
in
those
four
other
corporations
you
own
70
%
of
each
one,
including
the
one
i
am
in,
the
fifth
one,
and
there
is
a
different
30
%
shareholder
in
each
corporation.
so
we
have
70
%
going
across,
if
i
can
draw
a
schematic
here,
and
30
%
going
down,
with
each
different
shareholder.
now,
not
only
is
the
corporation
in
which
you
and
i
own
stock...
not
only
does
that
corporation
lose
its
surtax
exemption
or
at
least
shares
its
surtax
exemption
under
the
regulation,
but
also
those
other
corporations
lose
their
surtax
exemption.
now
which
one,
which
corporate
group,
which
brother-sister
controlled
group
are
we
in?
what
we
have
is
five
corporations
with
six
shareholders,
and
the
statute
says
you
can
only
count
five
shareholders.
are
we
in
the
brother-sister
controlled
group
comprising
corporations
one
through
four,
leaving
the
fifth
one
out?
are
we
in
the
corporations
one
through
three,
leaving
four
and
five
in
separate
group?
are
we
not
in
a
brother-sister
controlled
group
at
all,
but
two
through
five,
corporations
two
through
five
are
in
separate
brother-sister
controlled
group?
this
type
of
arbitrary
determination
i
believe
illustrates
the
unreasonableness
of
the
regulation.
now,
the
regulation
does
have,
in
a
separate
part,
a
provision
dealing
with
overlapping
interest
like
this,
but
it
simply
provides
that
the
corporations
are
to
get
together
and
somehow
allocate
among
themselves
the
exemption
at
the
time
they
file
their
tax
return,
or
suffer
the
allocation
subsequently
made
by
the
commissioner
at
tax
audit
time.
but
how
can
the
parties
make
this
allocation
if,
prior
to
audit,
they
don't
even
know
who
is
in
the
group?
and
what
policy
reason
is
served
by
treating
identically-owned
corporations;
that
is,
70-30
corporations,
in
each
one
in
a
different
manner?
thus,
i
submit
that
the
regulation's
80
%
test
draws
a
totally
artificial
line,
and
creates
an
unreasonable
design
not
intended
by
congress,
by
arbitrarily
excluding
a
corporation
with
a
pattern
of
ownership
that
is
identical
to
every
other
corporation.
again,
from
a
policy
standpoint,
either
all
of
the
corporations
owned
70-30
should
be
in
the
group
or
none
should
be,
and
we,
of
course,
submit
that
none
should
be.
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
that
congress
ever
intended
to
lay
such
a
trap
for
the
expanded
group
of
unknowing
minority
shareholders.
now,
if
i
might
turn
for
a
second
to
the
proper
test
that
the
government
has
allocated
should
be
applied
to
this
particular
example,
this
particular
reg.
your
honors,
the
regulation
in
question
is,
without
a
dispute,
without
any
dispute
whatsoever,
an
example
of
an
interpretive
regulation
rather
than
a
legislative
regulation.
that
is,
i
define
a
legislative
regulation
as
one
written
in
direct
response
to
a
specific
delegation
of
authority
by
congress.
that's
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
portland
cement
case,
for
example.
this
regulation,
on
the
other
hand,
is
written
under
the
general
auspices
of
section
7805.
now,
i
well
understand
the
general
reluctance
and
the
general
wisdom
of
this
court
to
not
overturn
contemporaneous
constructions
of
a
statute
by
those
charged
with
its
administration,
and
who...
and
those
people
who
are
presumably
well
aware
of
congressional
intent.
i
believe
that
the
test
should
be
in
such
a
case,
though,
whether
that
regulation
implements
the
congressional
mandate
in
some
reasonable
manner.
as
recognized
by
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case
and
supported
by
this
court's
recent
decision
last
summer
in
rowan
companies,
the
rule
of
a
difference,
however,
is
not
appropriate
in
this
case
when
the
treasury
is
interpreting
a
definition
specifically
set
forth
in
a
statute,
such
as
we
have
here.
because
we
can't
in
this
case
measure
the
commissioner's
definition
word
for
word
against
a
statutory
definition
of
the
term
brother-sister
controlled
group,
the
proper
test
that
we
ultimately
get
to
to
determine
whether
the
congressional
mandate
has
been
fulfilled
is
to
look
to
see
whether
the
regulation
in
question
harmonizes
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
its
origin
and
its
purpose.
we
submit
that
it
fails
on
all
three
counts.
the
regulation,
going
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
first,
the
regulation,
of
course,
clearly
adds
four
very
important
words
to
its
otherwise
word-for-word
recitation
of
what
the
statute
says,
and
those
words
are
singly
or
in
combination.
thus,
i'd
submit
that
on
its
face,
the
regulation
adds
to
the
statute
words
that
congress
did
not
write.
without
a
doubt
then,
this
regulation
can
hardly
be
said
to
harmonize
with
the
statutory
definition
as
required
by
the
rowan
case.
the
government,
of
course,
has
advanced
the
theory
that
its
regulation,
in
spite
of
this
lack
of
harmony,
correctly
interprets
the
statute
under
some
type
of
a
natural
reading
theory.
while
this
type
of
analysis
may
have
initially
its
appeal,
the
problem
with
such
a
natural
reading,
as
you
have
alluded
to,
is
that
it
ignores
the
well-established
and
commonly-used
guidelines
of
english
grammar
and
usage
in
interpreting
the
statute.
of
course,
congress
could
have
emphasized
that
the
80
%
test
required
common
ownership
by
reiterating
the
phrase
"each
such
person
in
the
80
%
test
as
well
as
in
the
50
%.
"
but
it
really
didn't
mean
to
do
that.
first
of
all,
it
was
not
abandoning
the
principle
of
common
ownership
as
found
in
the
1964
statute.
second
of
all,
it
was
not
ignoring
the
english
language
in
the
structure
of
the
statute.
these
two
factors
we
believe
effectively
cause
such
phrase
to
be
part
of
the
80
%
test
without
the
need
for
congress
to
reiterate
the
phrase
in
the
statute.
now,
this
particular
interpretation,
i
want
to
emphasize,
does
not
import
the
entire
identical
interest
clause
into
the
80
%
test.
it
merely
illustrates
the
use
by
statutory
analysis
of
what
persons
should
be
in
the
80
%.
and
once
you
have
that
group
determined,
these
two
tests
then
work
separately
to
fulfill
their
purposes
as
congress
intended.
mr.
jensen,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
you
or,
were
your
office
counsel
for
these
corporations
at
the
time
the
1973
and
74
returns
were
filed?
unknown
speaker
it
was
only
after
the
fairfax
case
was
decided
in
the
tax
court
that
a
different
direction
was
taken
by
the
taxpayer.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
fact
indicates
a
bow
in
the
direction
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
somebody
has
to
blow
the
whistle.
why
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
accountants
frequently
would
rather
get
refunds
than
have
their
clients
slapped
with
a
deficiency
notice,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
is
nothing
to
that
effect
in
this
record.
unknown
speaker
you
spoke
of
more
authority.
you
don't
have
all
authority,
though,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
have
the
tax
court
and
a
majority
of
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
claims.
unknown
speaker
judge
smith
went
the
other
way
in
your
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jensen,
is
the
tax
court's
interpretation
of
the
statute
the
same
as
the
court
of
claims'
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
would
decide
all
the
same
cases
in
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
reliance
on
"each
such
person"
in
b?
did
fairfax
rely
on
that
as
the
court
of
claims
did?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jensen,
let
me
interrupt
you
again.
i
have
not
looked
at
fairfax.
was
that
a
single
judge
ruling
or
was
it
reviewed
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
and
was
there
a
division
in
the
tax
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
remember
what
the
extent
of
that
division
was?
unknown
speaker
never
mind
if
you
don't.
i
can
look
it
up.
unknown
speaker
how
many
members
of
the
tax
court
are
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
ought
to
win
without
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
at
the
time
that
the
treasury
department
was
talking
to
the
congress,
when
this
act
was
passed,
that
their
explanation
was
far
from
clear
and
didn't
set
forth
the
position
that
was
subsequently
adopted
in
the
treasury
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
have
concerns
about
that.
it
looks
somewhat
as
though
the
treasury
department
had
second
thoughts
after
the
act
was
passed
and
then
adopted
the
regulation,
and
that
it
didn't
have
the
same
thoughts
when
it
was
talking
to
the
congress.
