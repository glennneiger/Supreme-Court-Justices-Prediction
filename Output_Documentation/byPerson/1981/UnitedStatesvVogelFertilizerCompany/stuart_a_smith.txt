mr.
stuart
a.
smith
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
federal
income
tax
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
it
involves
a
definition
of
controlled
group
of
corporations
and
component
members.
a
technical
area
of
the
tax
law
that
we
believe
appropriately
lends
itself
to
elucidation
by
means
of
the
commissioner's
treasury
regulations.
and
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
regulation
that
specifically
addresses
the
facts
of
this
case,
with
an
explicit
example
that
governs
this
case.
as
we
shall
point
out
later
in
our
argument,
the
court
of
claims
admitted
in
its
opinion
that
the
commissioner's
regulation
was
not
unreasonable.
but
it
went
on
to
hold
that
the
regulation
was
invalid
because
it
believed
that
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
served
better
purposes
and
was
more
reasonable.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it
bears
repeating
that
under
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
of
this
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
court
of
claims
has
reached
a
more
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
rather,
the
question
is
whether
the
commissioner's
regulation
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
think
it
is,
and
with
this
admonition
in
mind,
i
think
we
can
turn
to
the
particular
statute
at
hand.
it
is
section
1563(a)(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
pertinent
parts
of
which
are
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
of
our
brief.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
what
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was,
which
i
think
is
beyond
dispute.
the
corporate
income
tax
is
made
up
of
two
levels,
a
basic
rate
and
a
surtax.
for
example,
a
30
%
normal
rate
and
a
25
%
surtax,
and
the
rates
keep
changing,
but
normally,
it's
on
the
first
$25,000
there
is
the
normal
rate,
and
then
the
combined
normal
rate
and
surtax
on
the
remainder
of
taxable
income.
because
of
this
split
in
brackets,
it
has
been
attempted
by
various
business
organizations
to
split
income
among
many
different
corporations
which
are
essentially
part
of
the
same
economic
enterprise,
to
reduce
the
overall
tax
burden
of
a
business.
and
because
of
that,
the
commissioner
has,
in
the
past,
had
a
number
of
statutory
weapons
at
his
disposal;
for
example,
section
269
and
1551
of
the
code,
which
required
a
judicial
inquiry
as
to
whether
these
corporations
were
formed
or
split
up
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
taxes
or
getting
an
additional
surtax
exemption.
because
of
the
difficulty
of
probing
and
deriving
these
factual...
entry
of
these
factual
increase,
congress
finally
adopted
this
statute
in
1964
and
amended
it
in
1969
to
establish
a
precise
mathematical
test.
and
if
you
are
a
controlled
group
of
corporations,
then
the
component
members
of
the
group
must
either
share
the
corporate
surtax
exemption
or
pay
a
6
%
penalty,
if
they're
going
to
each
claim
a
separate
surtax
exemption.
now,
the
particular
controlled
group
involved
in
this
case
is
the
so-called
brother-sister
group,
and
it
is
defined,
as
we
point
out
here
for
pertinent
parts
of
the
statute,
in
two
different
subparagraphs
of
section
1563(a)(2).
the
provision
says
two
or
more
corporations...
that
is
a
brother-sister
group...
if
five
or
fewer
persons
who
are
individuals
own
stock
possessing
(a)
at
least
80
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation,
and
(b)
more
than
50
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation,
taking
into
account
the
stock
ownership
of
each
such
person,
only
to
the
extent
such
stock
ownership
is
identical
with
respect
to
each
such
corporation.
basically,--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
think
the
reasoning
behind
the
court
in
united
states
v.
cartwright
was
that
the
regulation
was
unreasonable
and
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
we
think
the
regulation
at
issue
here
fully
implements
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
is
consistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
of
eliminating
multiple
surtax
exemptions
for
corporations
controlled
as
a
single
economic
entity.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think...
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
i
think
our
position
will
become
clear.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
two
shareholders;
arthur
vogel
and
richard
crain,
and
two
corporations,
vogel
fertilizer
and
vogel
popcorn.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
arthur
vogel
owns
77.49
%
of
vogel
fertilizer.
richard
craine
owns
the
remaining
22.51
%
of
vogel
fertilizer.
for
vogel
popcorn,
arthur
vogel
owns
87.5
%
of
the
stock
of
vogel
popcorn.
now,
just
looking
at
the
plain
words--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes,
exactly.
we
think
the
80
%
test
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
only
part
of
this
statute
that's
at
issue
here,
everyone
agrees
that
the
50
%
part
of
the
statute
is
met,
but--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
crain
owns
nothing
of
popcorn.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that's
the
issue
here,
as
to
whether
crain
has
to
own
any
shares
in
popcorn.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it's
our
position
here
that
that
is
irrelevant
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
and
just
reading
the
statute,
the
question
is
whether
five
or
fewer
persons...
and
here
we
have
arthur
vogel
and
richard
crain...
own
stock,...
who
are
individuals,
which
they
are...
own
stock
possessing
at
least
80
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation.
now,
arthur
vogel
and
richard
crain
own
100
%
of
vogel
fertilizer,
and
arthur
vogel,
who
is
also
a
person
in
that
group,
owns
87.5
%
of
vogel
popcorn.
in
our
view,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
supports
the
result
that
subparagraph
(a)
applies
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
when
the
recess
occurred,
we
were
discussing
the
text
of
section
1563(a)(2),
which
is
set
forth
in
pertinent
part
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
of
our
brief.
the
statute
defines
a
brother-sister
group,
which
consists
of,
quote,
"two
or
more
corporations,
if
five
or
fewer
persons
who
are
individuals
own
stock
possessing
(a)
at
least
80
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation,
and
(b)
more
than
50
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation
taking
into
account
the
stock
ownership
of
each
such
person,
only
to
the
extent
such
stock
ownership
is
identical
with
respect
to
each
such
corporation.
"
the
statute
has
two
parts,
an
80
%
test
and
a
50
%
test.
perhaps
the
best
way
to
attack
the
statute
on
the
facts
of
this
case
is
to
first
put
out
of
the
way
the
50
%
test,
the
applicability
of
which
is
undisputed
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
because
the
80
%
rule,
or
part
of
the
statute,
is
still
important
in
order
to
insure
that
the
corporations
be
closely
held.
the
50
%
test
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1969
at
a
time
when
the
number
of
shareholders
went
from
one
to
five
in
order
to
retain
commonality
of
ownership
or
overlap.
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
illustrate
that
is
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
here
we
have
two
shareholders,
arthur
vogel
and
richard
crain,
and
two
corporations,
vogel
fertilizer
and
vogel
popcorn.
now,
arthur
vogel
owns
77.49
%
of
fertilizer,
and
richard
crain
owns
the
remaining
22.51
%.
arthur
vogel
owns
87.5
%
of
popcorn,
and
the
remaining
shares
of
popcorn
are
owned
by
a
trust.
crain
doesn't
own
any
shares
in
popcorn.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
crain
is
drawn
into
the
net
by
his
interest...
well,
when
you
say
vogel,
his
interest
in
fertilizer.
the
statute
applies
because
of
crain's
interest
in
fertilizer.
and
i
think
that
the
words
of
the
statute
support
our
submission
that
the
statute
applies.
let
me
first
put
out
of
the
way
the
application
of
the
50
%
test
in
subparagraph
(b).
the
italicized
words
which
we
have
italicized
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
of
our
brief,
the
taking
into
account
the
stock
ownership,
works
as
follows.
you
find
out...
you
take
into
account
the
stock
ownership
of
each
such
person
as
to
the
extent
it
is
identical.
in
this
particular
case,
the
identical
stock
ownership
is
77.49
%.
arthur
vogel
owns
that
amount
in
vogel
fertilizer,
and
indeed,
he
owns
87
%
of
vogel
popcorn.
so
using
77
%,
to
round
the
figures,
as
the
identical
stock
ownership,
subparagraph
(b)
of
the
statute
which
demands
that
five
or
fewer
persons
own
more
than
50
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation
is
met.
because
indeed,
arthur
vogel
is
one
person;
one
is
less
than
five,
and
the
required
overlap
is
met.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
is
conjunctive,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
and
b
of
the
statute
have
to
work
in
tandem.
but
our
submission
is
that
the
court
of
claims
has
confused
the
application
of
a
and
b
by
requiring
some
overlap
in
a,
when
the
words
of
the
statute,
if
i
may
suggest,
simply
don't
speak
to
any
overlap.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
do
have
to
subsist
together,
but
in
our
view
they
subsist
together
to
the
extent
that
we're
talking
about
the
same
group
of
five
or
fewer
persons.
here,
the
group
is
arthur
vogel
and
richard
crain;
two
persons,
ergo,
less
than
five.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
have
two
that
satisfy
a.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
two
that
satisfy
a
are
arthur
vogel
and
richard
craine,
because
going
back
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
if
five
or
fewer
persons
who
are
individuals
own
stock
possessing
at
least
80
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
actually,
for
fertilizer
it's
100
%,
because--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--and
for
popcorn,
arthur
vogel
satisfies
it
in
its
entirety,
because
he
owns
87
%.
you
don't
have
to
look
to
anything
else.
in
our
view,
this
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
they
simply
talk
about
both
tests
that
have
to
be
met.
our
submission
here
is
that
based
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
the
only
thing
that
is
required
is
that
five
or
fewer
persons
own
at
least
80
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
court
of
claims
did
not
agree
with
us
because
they
looked
to
the
phrase
"each
such
person"
in
subparagraph
b,
and
they
somehow
felt
that
each
such
person
really
spoke
to
five
or
fewer
persons,
and
that
somehow,
that
meant...
and
i
must
confess
that
it
really
is
as
the
second
circuit
characterized
it
in
allen
oil
company,
a
convoluted
reading
of
the
statute.
because
what
they
have
done
is
take
a
kind
of
hybridized
overlap
and
attributed
that
to
subparagraph
a,
when
in
fact,
subparagraph
a
has
no
overlap
at
all.
the
overlap
aspects
of
the
statute
are
completely
carried
by
subparagraph
b.
if
there
is
50
%
overlap,
that
satisfies
the
overlap
aspects
of
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed.
both
ordinary
and
extraordinary
people
engage
in
that
on
a
daily
basis.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i'm
not
sure
that
there
are
any
such
of
strict
construction
against
one
party
or
the
other.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
indeed,
here.
and
indeed,
we
don't
even
think
it's
ambiguous.
but
to
the
extent
that
one
could
convolute,
we
think
that
here
we
have
a
treasury
regulation--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--to
the
extent
that
if
one
could
mis...
you
know,
engage
in
another
interpretation.
we
think
here,
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
there
are
treasury
regulations
that
elucidate
the
statute,
provide
for
an
example
that
speaks
to
the
very
question
in
this
case,
which
we
think--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--that
regulation
came
out
in
temporary
form,
mr.
justice
white,
in
march
of
1971,
two
years
before
the
taxable
years
at
issue.
and
indeed,
the
taxpayer
here...
there's
no
dispute
about
this...
filed
their
return
on
the
basis
of
not
claiming
separate
surtax
exemptions,
following
the
regulation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it's
really
what
is
defined
by
the
statute
in
objective
mathematical
terms.
it's
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
think--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
it's
not
the
lines
of
business.
it's
simply
the
percentage
of
shareholdings
and
overlap.
it's
a
particular
kind
of
closely-held
group
of
corporations
in
which
there
is
the
requisite
overlap,
and
we
think
they
are
met
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
illustrate
your
point
is
perhaps
by
pointing
that
the
court
of
claims
agreed
here,
and
indeed
responded,
it
concedes,
that
the
statute
would
be
met
in
this
case
if
richard
crain
owned
one
share
of
stock
in
vogel
popcorn.
because
in
their
view,
you
can't
really
count
crain's
interest
for
purposes
of
the
80
%
test
unless
he
owns
some
de
minimus;
indeed,
one
share,
of
vogel
popcorn.
and
we
think
that
really
turns
the
legislative
purposes
on
its
head.
what
congress
was--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--that
is
indeed
the
way--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--that's
the
issue.
and
we
don't
think
that
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
five
or
fewer
persons...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
read
a
and
b
as
separate
parts
of
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
no,
no.
i
think
that
the
five
or
fewer
persons
is
the
same
group.
but
the
question
is
really
whether
each
member
of
the
five
or
fewer
persons
has
to
own
stock
in
a
and
b,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
words
of
the
statute
support
that.
we're
taking
about
five
or
fewer
persons
who
are
individuals
who
own
stock,
processing
at
least
80
%
of
the
stock
of
each
corporation,
and
that's
concededly
met
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
could
crain--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--he
doesn't
own
any
of
the
stock
of
popcorn,
indeed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
crain
didn't
do
anything
wrong,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
only
way
that
the
numbers
would
have
to
be
changed,
crain
would
have
to
sell
some
of
his
shares.
well
basically,
you'd
have
to
have
a
situation
where
perhaps
six
shareholders--
what
congress
was
interested
in
was
making
sure...
to
attack
and
to
prevent
income
spreading
among--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
think
that's
really
looking
at
the
case
in
an
inappropriate
way,
and
in
a
way
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
i
do
want
to
answer
the
question,
but
i
don't
think
it
really
helps
the
analysis
to
talk
about
as
a
guilty
party.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that,
you
know,
on
the
fats
of
this
case,
with
crain
owning
22
%...
if
crain
is
going
to
insist
on
owning
22
%
of
the
shares,
then
he
has
to
acquiesce
in
congress's
decision
that
these
two
corporations
are
not
going
to
share...
are
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
separate
corporate
surtax
exemptions
because
these
are
members
of
a
brother-sister
controlled
group,
as
the
statute
is
defined.
the
shareholdings
could
be
re-arranged
perhaps
in
a
way
to
provide
for
more
than
five
shareholders.
crain
could
presumably--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
crain
could
sell
his
stock
to
five
other
people.
and
then
there
would
be
six
shareholders.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
true,
that
is
true.
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
you
know,
because
the
respondent
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
our
construction
of
the
statute
visit
surprises
on
fellow
shareholders,
the
tax
laws
are
replete
with
instances
where
that
could
be
the
case.
you
could
have
a
subchapter
s
corporation
in
which
you
have
the
maximum
number
of
shareholders,
and
then
one
of
the
shareholders
decides
to
sell
some
stock
to
someone
else,
which
thereby
increases
the
number
of
shareholders
beyond
the
maximum.
and
the
corporation
then
loses
its
status.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
that
might
happen
necessarily
casts
doubt
on
what
we
think
is
really
the
plain
language,
our
interpretation,
which
is
really
supported
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
it
wouldn't
make
the
50
%
requirement
superfluous,
mr.
justice
white,
because
they
said
they
would
satisfy
it
if
richard
crain
owned
one
share
of
stock
of
vogel
popcorn.
that
wouldn't
do
anything
to
the
50
%
test.
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--identical
amounts--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--oh,
that
would
indeed...
yes--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
to
satisfy
the
subparagraph
a
test?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that
would,
in
effect,
make
it
superfluous.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
of
claims
is
saying
here.
i
think
what
the
court
of
claims
is--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr
justice
stevens
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that
they
have
to
be
taking
the
identical
shareholding--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--so
it
would
be
20
and
20,
so
that
would
only
be
40;
it
would
be
less
than
50
%.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
now,
i
think
that
it's
relevant
that
the
fact
that
respondent
concedes
and
the
court
of
claims
concedes
that
if
richard
crain
owned
one
share
of
stock
in
vogel
popcorn
that
the
result
would
be
different,
really,
it
seems
to
me,
proves
the
validity
of
the
interpretation
that
we
are
urging
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
because
at
that
point,
the
share...
it
had
to
be
one
shareholder
owning
80
%
or
more
of
each
corporation.
that
was
the
requirement.
the
overlap
and
the
closely
held
aspects
of
the
statute
were
merged
in
the
single
80
%
test.
but
when
congress
in
1969
determined
that
it
was
very
easy
to
avoid
application
of
the
statute
because
you
could
simply
just
sell
a
few
shares
to
another
shareholder
and
then
you
would
have
two
shareholders.
so
they
expanded
the
shareholder
group
to
five.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
no,
because
i
think,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
footnote,
the
common
ownership
aspect
of
the
statute
was
taken
up
by
the
50
%
test
of
subparagraph
b.
and
that's
the
import
of
the
language,
taking
into
account
the
stock
ownership
of
each
such
corporation
only
to
the
extent
that
such
stock
ownership
is
identical.
and
once
the
50
%
common
ownership
requirement
was
taken
into
the
statute,
in
our
view
the
only
thing
left
of
the
80
%
test
was
closely
the
held
tack
that
the
corporation--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
would
concede
that,
but
i
would
also
suggest
to
you
and
the
court
that
once
the
statute
changed,
the
statute
had
to
be
construed
in
a
different
sort
of
way;
that
the
common--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes,
indeed,
but
once
adding
subsection
b,
it's
clear
that
the
legislative
history,
the
treasury
studies,
indicate
that
the
aspect
of
common
ownership
that
the
statute
was
attacking
was
going
to
be
covered
completely
by
the
50
%
test,
because
if
that
were
not
the
result,
then
it
would
be
an
80
%
common
ownership
test
and
everyone
agrees
that
that
is
not
the
case
here;
it's
only
a
50
%
common
ownership.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
because
in
our
view,
if
crain
had
owned
one
share
of
popcorn,
that
really
wouldn't
have
enhanced
vogel's
ability
to
control
these
corporations
as
a
single
economic
entity.
and
in
our
view,
the
statute
really
wasn't
intended
to
turn
on
such
minute
differences,
and
it
supports,
i
think,
the
commissioner's
regulation
which
implements
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
that's
true,
but
i
don't
think,...
there
are
lines
here.
80
%
test
and,
of
course,
if
79.9,
it
wouldn't
fit
the
statute.
but
i
think
our
point
simply
is
here,
if
congress
was
attacking
and
trying
to
define
enterprises
controlled
as
a
single
economic
entity,
it
really
forced
that
purpose
to
say
well,
we're
going
to
make
the
statute
apply
if
crain
owned
one
share
of
popcorn.
that
really
doesn't
add
anything
to
vogel's
ability,
and
that's
really
what
the
focus
of
the
statute
is
on.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
few
points.
to
answer
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question,
there
was
quite
a
sharp
dissent
in
fairfax
by
judge
simpson
joined
by
judges
baum,
tannenwald
and
wilbur.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
there
are
16
when
the
court
is
at
full
strength.
i'm
not
sure
whether
16
judges
were
on
this
particular
case.
and,
of
course,
that
decision
was
reversed
by
the
fourth
circuit,
as
was
the
tax
court
reversed
by
the
eight
and
the
second
circuit,
too.
i
simply
want
to
re-emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
think
that
based
on
the
court
of
claims,
concession
here
that
the
commissioner's
regulation
was
not
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute...
and
i
think
i
have
demonstrated
to
the
court
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
supports
the
commissioner's
interpretation...
that
we
think
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
the
regulation
should
be
approved
as
a
valid
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
we
ought
to
win
without
the
regulation
because
i
think
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
supports
us,
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
supports
us.
and
i
simply
want
to
say
in
closing
that
at
the
time...
and
this
really
goes
to
the
point
that
justice
o'connor
and
i
were
exploring...
at
the
time
that
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1969
to
expand
the
shareholder
group
from
one
to
five,
it
did
in
our
view
make
the
50
%
test
accomplish
the
common
control
purpose
of
the
statute
and
leave
the
80
%
test
simply
to
represent...
to
carry
the
closely-held
character
of
the
corporations.
and
at
the
time
that
congress
was
expanding
this
group
from
one
to
five,
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
ratified
the
treasury's
statement
that
it
intended
to
adopt
the
same
test
here
that
it
did
in
section
1551,
which
has
a
comparable
mathematical
test,
although
there
is
also
a
factual
inquiry
that
has
to
be
made
in
that
statute
as
to
whether
the
corporation
was
formed
to
receive
the
transfer.
and
at
the
time,
1969,
there
was
on
the
books
for
at
least
two
years
a
treasury
regulation
under
section
1551;
precisely,
1551-1g,
example
4,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
which
sets
forth
an
example
which
demonstrates
that
under
section
1551,
that
not
every
member
of
the
five
or
fewer
persons
has
to
own
stock
in
each
corporation
for
the
80
%
test
to
apply.
and
presumably,
the
same
treasury
that
was
recommending
the
expansion
of
the
test
knew
what
the
regulation
said,
and
basically
so
did
the
tax-writing
committees
of
congress.
and
it
seems
to
us
with
this
legislative
history
and
with
the
peculiar
result
that
would
be
reached
under
the
respondent's
interpretation
where
a
single
share
of
stock
would
cause
a
different
result,
based
on
the
plain
language
we
think
the
court
of
claims
was
wrong.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
i
would
agree
that
i
would
prefer...
my
case
would
be
stronger...
if
the
treasury
studies
adopted...
had
the
same
language
as
the
regulation.
but
the
regulation
came
not
far
down
the
road
as
a
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
statute,
and
given
the
history,
justice
o'connor,
of
the
similarity
that
congress
was
attempting
to
use
in
this
statute
as
in
section
1551,
i
think
it's
fair
to
conclude
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
adopt
the
same
test
that
existed
in
the
1551
regulation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
conclude
that
on
this
record.
there
is
really
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
regulation
was
an
afterthought.
many
regulations,
as
common
practice,
follow
the
enactment
of
the
statute
by
some
time
after
studies
and,
you
know,
they're
proposed
and
then
circulated
for
comment
and
then
come
out
in
final
form.
i
will
say
that
on
pages
27
and
28
we
set
forth
a
portion
of
the
treasury
proposals,
and
they
talk
about,
to
a
large
extent,
a
group
of
corporations
in
which
five
or
fewer
persons
own,
to
a
large
extent,
in
identical
portions
at
least
90
%
of
the
stock
of
each
of
the
corporations.
and
it
goes
on
then
to
describe
the
50
%
test
in
terms
of
the
stock
of
a
particular
person.
so
i
think
one
could
derive,
as
indeed
some
of
the
decisions
have
which
we
have
held
for
the
regulation,
the
fact
that
the
treasury
studies
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
regulation
that
ultimately
came
out,
pursuant
to
the
commissioner's
authority
to
prescribe
all
need
for
rules.
thank
you.
