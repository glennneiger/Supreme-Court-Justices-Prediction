justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
is
80-1251,
united
states
versus
vogel
fertilizer
corporation.
this
is
a
case
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
claims.
it's
a
tax
case.
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
limits
a
controlled
group
of
corporations
to
a
single
surtax
exemption.
the
group
of
corporations
involved
in
this
case
consists
of
two
corporations,
vogel
fertilizer
company
and
vogel
popcorn
company.
there
are
two
stockholders
in
the
fertilizer
company,
one,
vogel,
who
owns
77.5%
and
one,
crain,
who
owns
the
remaining
22.5%.
but
crain
is
not
a
stockholder
of
the
popcorn
company.
vogel
owns
87.5%
of
that
company
stock
and
the
rest
is
also
held
by
him
as
trustee
of
the
family
trust.
now
in
implementing
treasury
regulation
interprets
the
relevant
statutory
term
to
constitute
two
or
more
corporations,
a
controlled
group.
if
the
same
five
or
fewer
persons
own
“singly
or
in
combination”
certain
prescribed
percentages
of
voting
power
or
total
value
80-percent
of
the
total
of
the
one
corporation
and
more
than
50-percent
of
the
total
of
the
other.
since
vogel
and
crain
between
them
own
more
than
80-percent
of
the
stock
of
the
fertilizer
company
and
vogel
alone
owns
over
90-percent
of
the
popcorn
company,
if
the
provision
of
the
regulation
singly
or
in
combination
is
valid,
then
the
two
companies
are
a
controlled
group
entitled
only
a
single
surtax
exemption.
but
we
hold
that
the
implementing
treasury
regulation
is
invalid
as
not
being
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
it
purports
to
implement.
we
read
the
statute
to
require
that
precisely
the
same
shareholders
must
satisfy
both
the
80-percent
and
50-percent
requirements.
and
since
crain
is
not
a
stockholder
of
the
popcorn
company
but
only
the
fertilizer
company,
the
statutory
requirement
is
not
met.
we
therefore
affirm
the
court
of
claims
would
reach
the
same
conclusion.
