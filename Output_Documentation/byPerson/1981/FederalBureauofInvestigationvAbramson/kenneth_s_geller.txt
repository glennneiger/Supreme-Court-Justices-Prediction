mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
freedom
of
information
act
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
at
issue
is
exemption
7
of
the
foia
which
exempts
from
mandatory
disclosure
investigatory
records
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
to
the
extent
that
production
of
such
records
would
cause
one
of
six
discrete
harms
listed
by
congress
in
exemption
7.
the
question
presented
is
whether
records
in
the
fbi's
law
enforcement
files
that
satisfy
exemption
7,
and
hence
that
are
exempt
from
mandatory
disclosure,
lose
that
exempt
status
when
they
are
later
summarized
into
another
fbi
document
that
was
not
compiled
for
purposes
of
law
enforcement.
and
the
documents
involved
in
this
case
are
so-called
name
check
summaries
concerning
eleven
individuals
that
were
prepared
by
the
fbi
in
october
1969
in
response
to
a
request
by
john
ehrlichman,
who
was
then
the
counsel
to
the
president.
the
fbi
frequently
prepares
name
check
summaries
at
the
request
of
the
white
house,
generally
when
someone
is
being
considered
for
a
presidential
appointment
or
for
an
invitation
to
a
white
house
function.
when
the
fbi
got
the
white
house
request
in
this
case,
it,
as
it
did
in
other
name
check
requests,
checked
its
law
enforcement
records
and
wrote
a
short
memorandum
summarizing
its
file
information
about
each
of
the
eleven
individuals.
in
the
case
of
a
few
of
the
individuals
the
fbi
files
included
a
name
check
summary
that
had
been
prepared
in
response
to
an
earlier
white
house
request.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
a
number
of
agencies
in
the
federal
government,
including
the
white
house,
when
they
need
certain
information
for
perfectly
lawful
purposes
about
a
particular
individual,
they
will
ask
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
check
its
files
and
run
what
is
called
a
name
check
on
that
individual
and
notify
the
agency
of
anything
pertinent
that
they
may
have
found.
and
as
i
said,
the
white
house
frequently
would
send
over
name
check
requests
to
the
fbi;
for
example,
when
the
president
was
thinking
of
naming
somebody
to
a
presidential
appointment
or
someone
was
being
considered
for
an
invitation
to
a
white
house
function,
there
would
have
to
be
some
security
checks
and
other
things.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
a
memorandum
summarizing
information
in
the
fbi's
files
in
the
individual's
case.
perhaps
the
facts
of
this
case
are
a
trifle
confusing.
it
might
well
benefit
the
court
at
this
point--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
right.
they
would
not
do
a
separate
investigation.
they
would
simply
check
their
files
for
that
person
and
write
a
memorandum
explaining--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
that
would
be
in
their
file
if
they
had
that
information.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
would
not
go
about--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
they
do
not.
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
by
name
checks
here.
these
are
fairly
routine
checks.
the
fbi,
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
do
anything
more
in
response
to
these
routine
inquiries
than
check
their
file
information;
and
if
they
find
nothing,
they
will
tell
the
agency
we
found
nothing
in
our
file
about
the
individual.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
they
are
computerized
to
the
extent
that
that
could
be
determined.
but
the
point
is
they
don't
go
out
and
do
a
separate
investigation
in
response
to
these--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no.
i
assume
at
some
point
these
arrest
records
began
to
be
integrated
into
the
fbi's
files.
i'm
not
aware
of
when
that
date
was.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
hesitate
to
give
an
answer
with
certainty
to
that
question,
justice
white.
i'd
like
to
check--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
do
not
know.
my
understanding
is
that
they
can
probably
find
that
information
very
quickly
through
computerization.
i
think
that
there
is
a
hookup.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
fbi
these
days
is
arranged
with--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
of
course,
these
name
check
requests
came
in
in
1969.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
doubt
that,
but
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
once
again,
as
to
the
internal
organization
of
the
fbi.
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
the
court
of
appeals
did,
but
none
of
these
are
defined
terms
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
we
don't
think
they
have
any
particular
significance.
it's
important
to
realize
that
the
1974
amendments
to
exemption
7
were
quite
controversial,
and
there
were
a
number
of
allegations
by
opponents
of
those
amendments
that
these
amendments
would
hinder
law
enforcement.
and
in
fact,
president
ford
vetoed
the
1974
amendments
for
that
reason,
and
the
amendments
were
repassed
over
his
veto.
now,
there
was
substantial
debate
both
prior
to
and
after
the
veto
as
to
what
the
thrust
of
these
amendments
would
be,
and
proponents
of
these
amendments,
such
as
senator
hart
and
senator
kennedy,
repeatedly
assured
their
colleagues
that
no
information,
no
matters,
no
records,
no
documents
in
the
fbi's
law
enforcement
records
would
have
to
be
turned
over
to
any
foia
requester
if
one
of
these
six
discrete
harms
listed
in
the
statute
would
occur
as
a
result
of
production.
they
used
these
words
interchangeably.
the
word
foia,
but
interestingly,
it
is
defined
under
the
privacy
act
which
was
passed
the
very
same
week
as
the
1974
amendments
to
the
foia.
and
the
privacy
act
defines
"record"
as
including
any
item
of
information.
it
doesn't
talk
about
discrete
documents.
and
we
think
that
that
same
sort
of
definition
should
apply
in
construing
the
foia
and
particularly
in
construing
the
exemption
7.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
at
the
time
that
the
initial
request
came
in,
i
think
that
the
fbi
in
responding
to
that
foia
request
listed
exemption
6
as
well
as
exemption
7(c).
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
it
was
probably
abandoned
because
the
people
who
were
putting
together
the
district
court
papers
in
this
case
assumed
that
these
were
clearly
law
enforcement
records
and
that
the
pertinent
exemption
was
exemption
7.
also,
when
you're
dealing
with
personal
privacy,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
rose
case,
exemption
7(c)
imposes
on
the
government
a
somewhat
easier
test
to
meet
than
exemption
6.
under
exemption
6
the
government
would
have
to
show
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy,
whereas
under
exemption
7(c)
all
that
would
have
to
be
shown
is
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
so
i
assume
that
exemption
6
was
not
put
forward
on
the
understanding
that
exemption
7(c)
was
more
relevant
and
imposed
an
easier
test
on
the
government
to
meet.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
what
they
would
do
is
they
would
go
to
their
files,
and
they
would
check
to
see
what--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
they
keep,
as
i
understand
it,
two
sets
of
files.
one
would
be
by
name.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
result
of
the
full
field
investigation,
as
i
understand
it,
would
be
in
the
file
on
me
or
on
the
eleven
individuals
whose
names
were
requested
in
this
case.
but
as
i
say,
the
facts
are
a
little
confusing,
and
i
do
think
it
would
help
the
court
if
i
could
direct
the
court's
attention
at
this
point
to
pages
31
and
32.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
page
31
is
one
of
the
name
checks
that
was
sent
over
in
response
to
the
ehrlichman
request.
this
was
a
name
check
on
joseph
duffey,
and
this
is
it,
one
page
long,
essentially
saying
that
there
was
nothing
on
mr.
duffey
in
the
files.
however,
there
was
one
piece
of
information
that
was
deleted,
blacked
out
there
under
exemption
7.
page
32
of
the
joint
appendix
contains
another
one
of
the
name
checks
sent
over
in
response
to
the
ehrlichman
request,
this
one
for
john
kenneth
galbraith.
once
again,
all
it
says
is
that
prior
name
checks
had
been
prepared
for
mr.
galbraith
in
1961
and
1965,
presumably
when
president
kennedy
and
president
johnson
were
considering
him
for
a
presidential
appointment.
and
copies
of
those
prior
name
checks
are
attached.
now,
these
prior
name
checks
are
the
so-called
attachments
that
we
refer
to
in
our
brief
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
in
its
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
were--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
court
of
appeals...
we
don't
dispute
that.
the
court
of
appeals
distinguished
between
the
name
check
summaries
prepared
in
1969
in
response
to
the
ehrlichman
request
and
the
attachments,
which
were
in
existence
before
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
there
were
attachments
as
to
about
four
of
these
individuals.
some
of
these
attachments
are
prior
name
check
requests,
as
in
the
case
of
john
kenneth
galbraith.
some
of
the
attachments
were
other
raw
fbi
documents
that
happened
to
be
in
that
person's
file,
and
rather
than
summarize
them
or
excerpt
them,
they
were
simply
attached
and
sent
over.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
as
to
those
attached
documents
if
those
attached
documents
were
compiled
for
purposes
of
law
enforcement
that
they
would
retain--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--only
to
the
attachments.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
those
attachments
had
been
prepared
for
purposes
of
law
enforcement,
and
if
they
were,
then
exemption
7,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
would
apply
to
them.
that's
what
we
think
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
said,
i
think
that's
the
holding
in
this
case,
that
those
summaries--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--not
the
summary,
not
the
summary.
and
that's
what
we
find
to
be
the
utter
literalness
and
foolishness
of
the
distinction
that
the
d.c.
circuit
has
drawn
between
the
summaries,
which
are
simply
summaries
of
underlying
raw
fbi
documents,
and
the
attachments,
which
were
the
fbi
documents
themselves.
they
contain
the
same
information
in
the
two,
but
because
one
was
prepared
in
1969
in
response
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
not
a
law
enforcement
request,
exemption
7
is
not
applicable
as
to
them.
now,
the
respondent
made
an
foia
request
in
1976
for
the
documents
that
were
sent
over
to
the
white
house
in
response
to
john
ehrlichman's
request,
and
the
fbi
eventually
gave
respondent
a
large
amount
of
materials,
but
it
deleted
certain
portions
of
these
materials
under
exemption
7(c)
for
personal
privacy
reasons
and
exemption
7(d)
because
disclosure
would
reveal
the
identify
of
a
confidential
source.
respondent
didn't
challenge
the
7(d)
deletions,
but
he
did
claim
that
the
deletions
under
exemption
7(c)
were
improper.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
fbi
and
upheld
those
deletions,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
was
willing
to
accept
the
fbi's
contention
that
the
name
check
summaries
were
nothing
more
than
summaries
of
underlying
law
enforcement
documents,
and
they
were
also
willing
to
accept
arguendo
that
those
underlying
documents
were
entitled
to
exemption
7
protection.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
take
issue
with
the
district
court's
findings
that
release
of
this
information
would
have
led
to
one
of
the
specific
harms
that
congress
included
in
exemption
7,
7(c),
personal
privacy.
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
ordered
the
sensitive
information
disclosed
to
respondent
because
the
court
found
that
the
name
check
summaries
themselves,
as
opposed
to
the
underlying
documents
they
summarized,
were
not
investigatory
records
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
but
were
instead,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
prepared
for
political
purposes.
and
the
court
therefore
found
that
the
summaries
did
not
satisfy
the
threshold
requirement
of
exemption
7
and
had
to
be
disclosed.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
as
to
the
attachments,
the
name
check
summaries
were
all
prepared
in
october
1969
in
response
to
the
ehrlichman
request.
the
attachments,
as
i
said
in
the
case
of
john
kenneth
galbraith,
those
attachments
were
prepared
in
1961
and
1965,
and
some
of
the
other
attachments
in
this
case
may
well
have
gone
back
even
longer
than
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
that
mr.
galbraith
was
appointed
as
ambassador
to
india
by
president
kennedy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
that
is
the
reason
that
a
summary
was
prepared
for
mr.
galbraith
in
1961,
and
presumably
in
1965
president
johnson
was
thinking
of
appointing
him
to
some
position.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
situation
is
very
unlikely
to
arise
this
way,
but
if
the
agency
that
receives
the
foia
request
looks
at
the
document
that
it
has
been
asked
for
and
can
show
that
that
information
originally
came
into
the
government's
hands--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
as
i
say,
i
think
it's
unlikely
to
arise
this
way,
but
yes,
our
argument
would
extend
that
far.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
it's
the
agency
that
is
going
to
have
the
burden
of
doing
this
tracing,
and
it's
often
not
going
to
be
very
easy
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
it's
also
important
to
remember
that
simply
tracing
this
information
back
to
law
enforcement
files
does
not
make
it
exempt.
all
it
means
is
that
you
meet
the
threshold
test
under
exemption
7.
you
still--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
agency
would
still--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
right.
the
agency
would
still
have
to
show
that
release
of
that
information,
even
after
it's
worked
its
way
into
a
new
document
and
many
years
have
passed,
would
cause
one
of
the
specific
harms
listed
in
exemption
7.
there's
no
question
in
this
case...
judge
ritchie
made
a
finding,
and
the
respondent
did
not
appeal
it...
that
the
privacy
protection
of
exemption
7(c)
would
be
violated
with
these
releases.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
if
the
agency
voluntarily
makes
the
document
public.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
think
it
could
do
so.
the
question
arises
when
the
foia
request--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
sears
case
dealt
with
exemption
5,
and
i'm
not
sure
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
don't
believe
that
the
factors
that
underlie
exemption
5
are
the
identical
sort
of
considerations
that
underlie
other
exemptions.
exemption
5
has
to
do
with
predecisional
determinations,
preserving
the
sanctity
of
the
predecisional
process.
and
once
a
final
decision
has
been
made
and
the
predecisional
determinations
have
been
expressly
adopted,
the
court
found
in
sears
that
there
is
no
reason
at
that
point
to
protect
the
predecisional
memorandum.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
you
know,
in
sears
the
court
faced
a
situation
somewhat
like
this,
and
while
it
said
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--exemption
5
would
no
longer
be
applicable,
documents
that
are
entitled
to
exemption
7
protection
would
not
lose
that
protection
if
they
were
incorporated
in
a
final
document.
now--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--some
of
these
attachments
are
raw
files,
yes.
yes,
they
are.
now,
perhaps
the
best
way
to
explain
the
error
in
the
court
of
appeals'
mechanical
and
excessively
literal
approach
is
to
give
a
fairly
typical
example.
suppose
the
fbi
compiled
an
investigatory
record
for
law
enforcement
purposes;
in
other
words,
a
record
that
clearly
meets
the
threshold
test
of
exemption
7.
and
for
simplicity's
sake
let's
assume
that
that
record
is
two
paragraphs
long.
now,
if
there
was
a
request
for
that
record,
there's
no
question
that
the
fbi
or
any
law
enforcement
agency
could
refuse
it
under
exemption
7,
assuming
one
of
the
six
harms
could
be
shown.
now,
if
instead
the
fbi
were
to
xerox
that
record
or
repeat
it
verbatim
in
a
second
record
which
was
not
compiled
for
purposes
of
law
enforcement,
then
the
d.c.
circuit
would
say
it
could
still
be
withheld
because
it
is
still
the
same
record;
it
hasn't
been
changed
in
any
way.
however,
if
that
second
document
rather
than
repeating
the
two
paragraphs
verbatim
repeated
only
one
of
those
two
paragraphs,
or
repeated
the
two
paragraphs
but
changed
one
sentence
in
the
two
paragraphs
or
added
a
new
sentence,
or,
as
in
this
case,
instead
of
repeating
the
two
paragraphs
verbatim
it
had
summarized
or
paraphrased
those
two
paragraphs,
then
the
d.c.
circuit
would
say
at
that
point
it's
a
new
record,
it
has
to
be
turned
over,
even
though
it
would
contain
the
identical
information
that
was
in
the
two
paragraphs
as
it
sat
in
its
original
source.
we
don't
think
that
any
test
that
could
lead
to
these
sort
of
results
could
possibly
be
what
congress
intended
when
it
intended
in
1974
to
wipe
out
the
somewhat
formal
interpretation
of
exemption
7
that
the
d.c.
circuit
had
given
it.
and
perhaps
i
can
give
another
example
that
will
bring
me
the
foolishness
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
approach
in
this
case.
the
respondent
in
this
case
made
an
foia
request
for
all
of
the
documents
that
were
sent
over
to
the
white
house
in
1969
in
response
to
the
ehrlichman
request.
as
a
result,
what
the
fbi
found
were
these
name
check
summaries.
but
let's
assume
instead
respondent
had
made
a
request
in
1976
for
all
of
the
information
in
the
fbi's
files
about
cesar
chavez,
for
example,
one
of
the
eleven
individuals.
what
the
fbi
would
have
done
is
it
would
have
gone
to
its
cesar
chavez
file,
and
it
would
have
found
two
things.
it
would
have
found
first
the
underlying
information
that
it
had
on
cesar
chavez,
clearly
exempt;
and
it
would
have
found
the
summaries
that
were
prepared
in
1969
which
did
nothing
more
than
summarize
the
underlying
information
that
it
had
on
cesar
chavez.
document
b
is
identical
to
document
a
except
it
summarizes
it.
the
same
harms
would
occur
from
release
of
document
b
that
would
occur
from
the
release
of
document
a.
it
might
well
be
a
serious
invasion
of
cesar
chavez's
privacy.
yet
the
d.c.
circuit
would
require
the
fbi
to
turn
over
those
summaries,
but
would
allow
the
fbi
to
retain
the
underlying
records
that
had
been
summarized.
once
again,
we
think
that
this
could
not
possibly
be
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1974
when
it
intended
to
wipe
out
and
overrule
the
line
of
excessively
literal
decisions
of
the
d.c.
circuit
under
exemption
7.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
if
it
simply
pertains
to
you,
although
if
you
ask
for
your
own
records,
that's
a
complication
that's
not
involved
here,
the
privacy
act
would
apply
as
well
as
the
freedom
of
information
act.
but
a
person,
no,
would
not
be
refused
his
own
records
under
exemption
7(c).
in
fact,
in
this
case
when
respondent's
first
request
came
in
and
asked
for
information
about
eleven
named
individuals,
the
fbi's
initial
response
was
would
you
please
give
us
notarized
statements
from
these
eleven
individuals
saying
that
they
don't
mind
that
we
give
out
the
information
on
them.
now,
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave
a
moment
ago
is
not
farfetched.
i
think
it's
almost
exactly
the
situation
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
so-called
attachments
that
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
argument.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
some
of
these
attachments
are
on
their
face
quite
clearly
complete
memoranda
prepared
prior
to
1969
pursuant
to
previous
totally
legitimate
white
house
name
check
requests.
these
memos
were
in
the
fbi's
law
enforcement
files
before
the
ehrlichman
request
was
made,
and
they
were
incorporated
in
and
attached
to
the
documents
sent
over
to
the
white
house
in
1969
in
response
to
the
ehrlichman
request.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
this
aspect
of
the
case,
the
attachments
aspect
of
the
case,
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
these
attachments
were
originally
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
if
they
were
and
if
the
disclosure
would
work
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy,
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
allow
the
fbi
to
withhold
them.
however,
if
the
fbi
instead
of
attaching
these
documents
when
they
sent
them
over
to
john
ehrlichman
had
instead
summarized
them,
the
same
information
would
be
going
over,
but
at
that
point
the
summaries
could
not
be
withheld
because
they
weren't
the
original
documents,
and
the
court
would
have
found
that
they
were
not
prepared
for
purposes
of
law
enforcement.
and
we
think
that
this
distinction
between
duplicate
law
enforcement
records
and
records
that
are
substantially
identical
but
not
exact
duplicates
is
just
the
sort
of
mechanical
and
senseless
approach
to
exemption
7
that
congress
wanted
to
eliminate
in
the
1974
amendments.
i
think
this
approach
is
responsive
to
none
of
the
concerns
that
underlie
the
exemption,
and
it
would
lead
to
anomalous
results,
some
of
which
i
mentioned
earlier.
the
harms
that
can
occur
from
the
release
of
a
law
enforcement
record
can
occur
just
as
easily
from
the
release
of
a
summary
of
that
record,
and
those
harms
don't
depend
at
all
on
the
purpose
for
which
the
summary
was
prepared.
we
therefore
think
that
the
court
should
reject
the
d.c.
circuit's
formal
approach
and
literalistic
approach
and
reverse
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
don't
think
it
could.
it's
interagency,
but
i
don't
think
exemption
5
would
apply
because
it
is
not
predecisional.
a
lot
of
the
material
is
simply
factual,
and
the
courts
have
held
that
exemption
5
doesn't
apply
to
simply
factual
material.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
a
justice
department
proposal
pending
to
amend
several
sections
of
the
foia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
under
the
proposal
the
justice
department
has
made
to
change,
exemption
7(d)s
would
now
be
exempt
because
the
proposal,
as
i
understand
it,
changes
the
language
of
exemption
7
to
read
"investigatory
records
or
information
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
"
to
make
it
clear
that
there
should
not
be
a
formalistic,
literal
focus
on
particular
pieces
of
paper
but
rather
on
what
is
the
information
that
the
law
enforcement
agency
is
being
asked
to
discloses.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
one
or
two
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
terms
of
whether
the
information
was
compiled
for
purposes
of
law
enforcement,
fbi
agent
donohoe
submitted
two
affidavits,
and
they
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
on
pages
18
and
19
he
said
that
he
traced
all
of
the
information
in
these
name
check
summaries
to
records
in
the
fbi's
law
enforcement
files.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that's
right,
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
presumption
you
have
to
indulge
in.
there's
actually
evidence,
unrebutted
evidence
in
the
file.
and
second,
i'd
like
to
just
point
out
the
irony
of
the
respondent's
interpretation
of
the
foia
here.
if
john
ehrlichman
had
had
a
law
enforcement
purpose
for
making
this
1969
request,
then
all
of
the
information
sent
over
to
him
in
1969,
including
the
name
check
summaries,
presumably
would
have
been
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purpose
and
could
be
withheld.
however,
since
the
district
court
found
that
john
ehrlichman
was
instead
motivated
by
a
desire
to
invade
people's
privacies
for
reasons
unrelated
to
law
enforcement,
the
result
is
that
the
fbi
now
has
to
open
up
all
of
its
files
about
these
people's
privacy
to
any
foia
requestor
who
asks
to
see
them.
it
does
not
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
finally,
in
terms
of
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
foia
and
whether
they
would
be
served
by
the
respondent's
interpretation
here,
we
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
response
to
the
respondent's
foia
request,
he
learned
of
the
john
ehrlichman
request,
he
got
a
copy
of
the
letter
that
the
fbi
sent
to
john
ehrlichman
in
response
to
that
request,
he
got
virtually
all
of
the
documents
that
were
sent
over
from
the
fbi
to
the
white
house
in
1969.
the
only
thing
we're
debating
here
is
whether
certain
small
snippets
of
this
information,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
cause
one
of
the
specific
harms
listed
in
exemption
7,
must
be
disclosed.
we
think
that
the
threshold
test
is
clearly
met
here,
and
judge
ritchie
found
that
exemption
7(c)
was
also
met.
we
therefore
think
that
the
fbi
was
entitled
to
withheld
this
information.
thank
you.
