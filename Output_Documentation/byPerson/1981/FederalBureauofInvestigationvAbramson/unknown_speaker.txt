unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
would
you
briefly
define
what
a
name
check
is?
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
know,
but
i'd
like
to
have
you
tell
me.
unknown
speaker
but
i
ask
again,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
fbi
would
respond
only,
with
respect
to
the
individual,
only
with
respect
to
what
it
found
in
its
own
files?
unknown
speaker
do
they
not
check
their
files
generally
to
see
whether
there
are
any
arrest
records
of
the
person?
isn't
that
the
starting
point
of
a
name
check?
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
it.
unknown
speaker
but
they
do
not
send
out
a
nationwide--
unknown
speaker
--question--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
someone
has
an
arrest
record
out
in
tipperary
or
some
other
place,
would
that
be
in
the
fbi's
files
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
fbi
doesn't
have
in
its
files
every
arrest
that's
been
made
since
time
began.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
as
of
today
when
there's
a
name
check,
if
someone's
been
arrested
for
anything
in
the
last
five
years
it
will
be
in
the
fbi
computer?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
right.
i
just
wondered
if
you
knew
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
mean?
is
it
in
its
own
files
or
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what
are
you
referring
to
then?
a
name
check,
they
report
only
what's
in
their
own
files.
that's
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
what's
on
their
own
computer?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
then,
i
ask
you
again,
do
they
have
on
their
computer
everybody's
arrest
record
in
the
last
five
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
have
on
the
computer
anybody's
conviction
for
anything
in
the
last
five
years?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
terminology?
unknown
speaker
do
you
use
the
term
documents
or
records
or
files
as
words
of
art
for
purposes
of
the
foia?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
you
mention
privacy.
did
the
government
take
the
position
that
exemption
6
at
one
time
applied,
the
privacy
exemption?
unknown
speaker
and
why
has
it
been
abandoned?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
i
gather
from
your
response
to
some
earlier
question
that
if
the
white
house
sent
over
and
said
give
us
a
name
check
on
kenneth
geller,
you
can't
tell
us
what
process
the
fbi
would
go
through
in
response
to
that
name
check.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
their
files,
their
files.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
that,
if
i
may
interrupt,
that
there's
a
full
field
investigation
on
you
so
that
they
wouldn't
have
to
resort
just
to
the
name
check.
unknown
speaker
of
what?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
how
many
of
those
attachments
are
involved
here,
mr.
geller?
there
are
eleven
individuals,
but
how
many
attachments
do
we
have?
unknown
speaker
forgive
me.
i
understand
one
of
the
government's
arguments
is
if
an
attachment
exists
that
that's
sufficient
to
qualify
for
the
exemption,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
many
of
these
eleven
individuals
are
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
gather
in
light
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
at
least
as
to
those
four,
the
court
might
believe
exemption
7
applies.
only
to
the
attachments.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
the
court
of
appeals
say
if
the
name
check,
the
main
body
of
the
name
check
that
was
sent
back
purported
to
summarize
one
of
the
attachments?
unknown
speaker
it
would
still
say
that
the
attachment
might
be
exempt,
but
the
summary
would
not.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
the
dates
when
the
information
was
compiled
as
to
each
of
the
persons
in
question?
in
other
words,
was
it
ten
years
before
or
one
week
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
taking
mr.
galbraith,
professor
galbraith
as
one
example,
did
he
hold
any
public
office
on
which
they
would
have
made
a
name
check?
unknown
speaker
and
this
might
have...
is
that
date
related
to
his
appointment
as
ambassador?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
how
far
your
position
takes
us?
supposing
we
agreed
with
you
that
the
summaries
when
given
to
mr.
ehrlichman
were
still
within
the
exemption.
then
suppose
mr.
ehrlichman
wrote
a
report
for
the
president
which
said
i
have
found
out
the
following
information
without
describing
its
source,
and
he
confined
himself
to
what
he
got
here
and
sent
it
to
the
president.
then
say
the
president
sent
that
information
to
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
and
said
i
want
you
to
audit
the
returns
of
these
people
because
i
found
out
the
following
information.
would
the
whole
chain
still
be
protected?
unknown
speaker
well,
say
the
request
goes
to
the
internal
revenue
sevice
in
my
hypothesis,
and
they
trace
it
back
and
say
this
all
came
from
law
enforcement
sources.
it's
been
rewritten
two
or
three
times,
but
the
basic
information
is
precisely
what's
involved
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
the
privacy
part
of
the
test
is
met
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
geller,
you
wouldn't
suggest,
would
you,
that
if
in
this
chain
that
justice
stevens
describes
this
information
is
included
in
a
document
that
is
normally
made
public,
you
wouldn't
say
that
that
may
be
excised
from
a
document
that
would
normally
be
made
public.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
say
we're
going
to
make
it
public,
but
we
can
excise
this
particular
piece.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with,
what
is
it,
sears,
the
sears
case?
is
it
the
sears?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
but
if
an
agency
includes
this
kind
of
information,
normally
would
include
this
kind
of
information
in
a
document
that
is
normally
available,
if
it
actually
relies
on
this
piece
of
information
for
coming
to
a
conclusion,
the
explanation
of
which
is
normally
made
public--
unknown
speaker
--i
know.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
can
i
back
up
a
minute?
the
information,
is
it
from
the
raw
files?
does
it
include
raw
files?
unknown
speaker
what
if
i
go
to
the
fbi
and
ask
them
to
release
anything
they
have
in
their
files
about
me?
are
they
entitled
to
rely
on
the
privacy
exemption
in
turning
down
my
request
if
it's
simply
pertains
to
me?
unknown
speaker
could
the
agency
have
relied
also
on
exemption
5,
had
it
chosen
to
do
so,
as
an
interagency
piece
of
information?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
the
director
has
some
proposals
pending,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
would
these
be
exempt
under
those
proposals?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
"even"?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
get
if
there's
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
there
were
four
united
states
senators
who
agreed
with
these
people.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
our
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
be
relevant
in
a
tangential
way
if
we
were
asked
to
pass
on
the
propriety
of
mr.
ehrlichman's
request,
but
that's
not
what
we're
dealing
with,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
his
conduct
is
not
in
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
his
conduct,
erhlichman's
conduct
is
not
in
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
say
his
conduct
is
not
in
issue.
if
he
had
called
the
fbi
and
said
conduct
an
investigation
on
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e,
that
would
be
another
matter;
but
here
we're
dealing,
as
i
understand
the
record,
with
material
that
the
fbi
already
had
in
its
possession
about
these
people,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
a
fact
that
the
information...
there
was
information
already
in
the
possession
and
in
the
records
of
the
fbi,
just
as
there
is,
for
example,
on
mr.
geller
and
probably
on
all
of
us
sitting
on
this
bench?
unknown
speaker
and
he
was
requesting
that
information.
unknown
speaker
but
are
we
concerned
in
construing
this
statute
and
the
exemptions
with
what
mr.
ehrlichman
had
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
the
summaries
were
compiled,
the
summaries
were
compiled
for
political
purposes
is
what
they
found.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
as
to
some
of
these
attachments
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
they
might
qualify,
because
they
indeed
had
been
put
together
for
law
enforcement
purposes?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
if
it
were
found
that
those
had
been,
the
attachments
had
been
prepared
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
then
they
would
qualify.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
dispute
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
disagree
with
that
phase
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
still
not
clear,
ms.
nelson.
do
you
or
not
agree
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
to
the
attachments?
unknown
speaker
well,
if--
unknown
speaker
--go
ahead
and
finish.
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i'm
referring
to,
ms.
nelson,
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
"if
it
is
found
that
the
attachment
documents
were
already
in
existence
and
a
part
of
the
fbi
files
prior
to
the
white
house
name
check
request,
and
those
original
documents
were
sent
to
the
white
house
as
initially
compiled
and
without
any
modification,
then
a
determination
would
have
to
be
made
as
to
whether
these
documents
meet
the
threshold
requirements
of
section
7(b).
"
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
argue.
we
must
judge
the
case
on
that
basis,
musn't
we,
because
you
didn't
cross
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be,
but
nevertheless,
that's
the
ruling
below,
isn't
it,
that
if
these
attachments
turn
out
to
have
been
compiled
for
law
enforcement,
they're
exempt.
don't
we
judge
the
case
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
compile
records
or
documents,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
compile
records
or
documents?
you
compile
information.
unknown
speaker
do
i
get
an
impression
correctly
that
if
the
statute
had
used
the
words
"initially
secured
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
"
then
you
wouldn't
have
any
claim
to
a
section
7
exemption?
unknown
speaker
"initially
secured"
so
that
it
was
plain
that
when
it
was
had
it
was
not
contemperaneous
with
the
request.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
help
us
much
here,
though,
does
it?
that
doesn't
help
us
much
here
on
your
arguments,
the
case
you're
referring
to,
assuming,
of
course,
that
it
were
binding
on
us,
which
it
isn't.
unknown
speaker
and
you
really
don't
know
what
happened
in
the
fbi.
unknown
speaker
you
said
they
went
to
the
files
and
did
this
and
did
that.
you
don't
know
what
they
do
in
any
case.
unknown
speaker
ms.
nelson,
with
respect
to
what
justice
brennan
read
to
you,
the
word
"original"
appeared
a
couple
of
times
in
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
would
you
agree
that
a
photostat
of
an
original
should
be
treated
like
an
original?
unknown
speaker
not
what
you'd
like.
unknown
speaker
supposing
you...
let's
ask
it
this
way.
supposing
we
had
a
document
in
the
fbi
files
that
was
clearly
exempt,
and
they
made
a
photostat
of
it
and
transmitted
it
to
the
white
house,
at
the
request
of
the
white
house
for
that
document.
exempt
or
not
exempt?
unknown
speaker
only
original
records
in
your
reading
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
if
the
original
were
protected
is
the
hypothesis.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
your
view
is
if
they
just
photostatted
a
file
and
shipped
that
over,
the
exemption
would
be
lost.
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
photostats.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
yet
not
as
to
the
attachments,
at
least
so
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think.
well,
she's
assuming
the
attachments
are
the
originals,
which
i
think
highly
unlikely
that
they
would
send
the
originals
and
keep
photostats
in
their
own
file.
but
that's
your
assumption
on
which
you
go
along
with
the
court
of
appeals,
that
they
attached
originals
and
retained
photostats.
unknown
speaker
you
understand
it,
but
you
disagree
with
it.
unknown
speaker
we
can
all
understand
that.
why
is
it
you
say
the
photostat...
the
original
was
protected
but
the
photostat
of
the
original,
an
identical
copy
of
it,
is
not
protected.
what's
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
let's
stick
to
exemption
7.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
only
the
originals
are
created,
and
a
photostat
of
an
original
is
not
a
creation,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what's
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
but,
ms.
nelson,
that
isn't
what
exemption
7...
it
doesn't
say
created.
it
says
compiled,
investigatory
records
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
unknown
speaker
and
you
thought
that
"compiled"
normally
applies
to
information
rather
than
documents.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
even
though...
so
you
would
be
compiling
a
record...
i
guess
you
have
to
compile
a
record
before
it's
within
exemption
7.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
think
you're
not
compiling
a
record
if
you
make
a
photostat
of
an
original
and
attach
it.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
yours,
too,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
this
isn't
relevant,
but
i
know
that
the
government
makes
something
of
it.
do
you
have
any
purpose
you're
willing
to
tell
us
about
for
seeing
these
documents?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
respondent
was
more
or
less
acting
on
behalf
of
one
of
these
eleven
individuals?
unknown
speaker
because
as
i
understand
what
the
government
tells
us,
these
eleven
individuals,
each
could
have
gotten
the
documents
pertaining
to
himself
without
any
question.
unknown
speaker
but
the
respondent's
interest
is
getting
at
the
material
that's
in
the
nature
of
private
information
pertaining
to
these
people.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
gather,
ms.
nelson,
if
i
understand
your
basic
argument,
it
really
is
that
even
if
they
are
precise
copies
of
documents
originally
put
together,
compiled,
or
whatever
word
you
want
to
use,
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
when
later
somebody
wants
copies
of
those
for
some
other
purpose,
they
have
to
be
disclosed.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
section
7.
unknown
speaker
well,
forgetting
other
exemptions,
so
far
as
exemption
7
is
concerned
am
i
correct
that
your
argument
basically
is
even
exact
copies
have
to
be
disclosed
if
the
copies
are
wanted
for
some
purpose
other
than
the
original
purpose
which
was
law
enforcement
purposes?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
you
can
argue
in
the
district
court
that
a
xerox
is
creating
a
new
document,
and
that
the
attachment
isn't
protected
unless
it's
the
original,
which
you
said
earlier.
unknown
speaker
ms.
nelson,
you've
used
the
word
"create"
a
number
of
times.
i
think
you
had
an
exchange
with
justice
white
over
"create"
versus
"compile".
actually,
the
statutory
language
of
the
exemption
speaks
just
of
compile,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
you
rely
on
the
court
of
appeals
decision
for
the
definition
of
"compiled"
as
opposed
to
"create"?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
you
would
be
better
off
with
the
broadest
possible
definition
or
rather
perhaps
with
the
narrowest
possible
definition
of
the
word
"compiled"
since
it's
an
exemption.
and
of
what
a
record
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
meant
from
the
point
of
view
of
one
seeking
disclosure;
you
know,
whether
or
not
the
argument
is
accepted,
the
argument
would
be
phrased
in
terms
of
the
narrowest
possible
definition
of
the
exemption.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
client
doesn't
need
to
go
to
the
foia
to
get
that
information.
or
to
bother
us
with
it.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
word,
the
statutory
word
"records"?
does
that
word
include
information
stored
in
a
computer
data
bank
just
with
electronic
signals?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
interpretation
we
don't
count
photostats.
i
just
wonder
if
we
count
electronic
signals
that
enable
one
to
produce
copies.
on
that
basis
any
time
you
had
a
printout
you
would
create
a
new
document
in
your
approach.
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
unknown
speaker
a
new
record.
therefore,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
nothing...
no
computerized
information
would
ever
be
exempt
from
disclosure.
whether
it
was
compiled
for...
whether
it
was
on
there
for
law
enforcement
purposes
or
not.
it
wouldn't
be
a
record
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
the
exemption
only
applies
to
records.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
could
send
it
over
to
somebody
else's
computer
by
pushing
the
send
button.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you
or
i
know
what
is
on
the
computer
at
the
fbi.
i
don't
think
we
do.
i
know
i
don't.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest
that
an
invasion
of
personal
privacy
has
nothing
to
do
with
exemption
7,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
no.
it
has
a
higher
standard.
it's
got
to
be
clearly--
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
judged
the
case
on
the
basis
that
they
were.
unknown
speaker
originally.
unknown
speaker
because
it
didn't
make
any
difference
to
the
court
of
appeals.
