ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
you
already
heard,
this
is
a
freedom
of
information
act
case,
and
a
case
which
certain
deletions
from
records
prepared
in
1969
pursuant
to
a
request
by
john
ehrlichman.
this
request
to
prepare
the
summaries,
the
so-called
name
check
summaries,
by
the
white
house
concerned
eleven
prominent
public
figures.
the
reason
apparently
that
mr.
ehrlichman
asked
for
this
summary
was
because
these
eleven
individuals
were
publicly
sponsoring
a
one-day
anti-vietnam
war
moratorium
along
with
four
united
states
senators.
as
has
been
mentioned,
individuals
in
this
list
include
john
kenneth
galbraith
and
even
dr.
benjamin
spock.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
i
have
to
take
a
personal
note
and
say
as
a
recent
mother,
benjamin
spock
is
somehow
put
on
a
different
level.
but
he
was
certainly
a
well-known
activist
at
that
time
and
a
well-known
public
figure
even
not
to
mothers.
i
think
it's
important
here
to
clarify
exactly
what
is
part
of
the
64-page
record
that
was
transmitted
pursuant
to
ehrlichman's
request.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
no,
but
i
think
it
does
sort
of
lend
towards
the
way
that
these
people
were
not
exactly
doing
something
subversive
to
be
investigated
for,
that
they
were
using
their
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
no.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
fact--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
oh,
i
think
that
ehrlichman's
conduct
is
very
much
at
issue
here
in
the
fact
that
these
fbi
files,
these
summaries
were
prepared
from
the
fbi
files
for
a
purpose
that
was
clearly
not
law
enforcement.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
the
record
is
clear
as
to
whether
ehrlichman
was
aware
of
the
limitation
of
what
the
fbi
was
or
was
not
going
to
do
with
respect
to
obtaining
information
on
the
eleven
people
that
he--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--that
is
true.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
he
was
requesting
that
the
fbi
prepare
summaries
of
information
on
these
eleven
individuals.
it
is
not
clear
that
he
understood
the
limitation
of
what
type
of
information
the
fbi
would
use
to
prepare
those
summaries.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i
think,
as
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
here,
that
it's
very
clear
that
these
files
were
compiled
for
a
partisan
political
reason
and
not
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose.
and
because
of
that,
because
of
that
exact
reason--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--that's
correct.
there
has
been
no
holding,
neither
at
the
district
court
level
nor
at
the
court
of
appeals,
as
to
the
reason
or
the
purpose
for
which
the
underlying
information
was
originally
compiled.
the
record
is
absolutely
barren
on
that
as
to
that
issue,
other
than
affidavits
that
have
been
submitted
by
petitioner.
but
the
courts
have
made
no
ruling
on
this
issue.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that...
it
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
review
and
determine
what
was
the
purpose
that
those
underlying
documents
were
compiled.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that's
correct.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was,
i
believe,
using
a
very
narrow
use
of
the
term
"compile".
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
we
contend
that
when
the
fbi
rounded
up
new
information
and
piled
together
this
new
information
and
submitted
it
for
a
purpose
other
than
law
enforcement
purposes
that
that
entire
file,
the
entire
record,
could
not
be
exempt
from
disclosure
under
exemption
7.
information
within
might
be
exempt
under
another
exemption,
but
it
could
not
be
exempt
under
exemption
7.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
we
certainly
agree
that...
we
certainly
would
not
dispute
if
the
court
would
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here.
we
certainly
can
understand
that
the
word
"compile"
can
be
used
to
mean
the
researching
of
information
and
the
creation
of
a
new
document.
and
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
using
that
definition
and
felt
that
the
attaching
of
a
document
was
not
the
creation
of
a
new
document.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i'm
sorry.
but
obviously,
the
summaries
that
were
created
in
'69...
and
these
are
sheets,
you've
seen
two
examples
of
the
shorter
ones;
some
of
the
others
are
certainly
longer...
they
certainly
show
without
question
that
they
were
prepared
in
1969
pursuant
to
this
request.
that
was
a
creation
of
a
new
document,
and
there
is
a
question
as
to
how
you
want
to
use
the
word
"compile".
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
as
i
said,
we
would
prefer
a
wider
reading
of
the
use
of
the
word
"compile",
but
we
would
certainly
not
dispute
that
that
is
the
holding
that--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--well,
the
reason
that
we
did
not
cross
appeal--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--well,
there
is
some
question,
i
think,
as
to
the
exact
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
here,
and
it
can
be
read
to
say
that
it
really
did
not
in
fact
rule
on
the
issue
of
attachments
and
left
that
as
an
open
statement
and
giving
some
direction
to
it.
we
did
not
cross
appeal
on
that
issue
because
we
felt
that
that
was
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
word
"compiled".
as
i
say,
we
certainly
feel
that
since
it
has
been...
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
a
disclosure
statute
requiring
the
broadest
disclosure,
that
the
use
of
the
word
"compiled"
in
its
most
narrow
term
goes
against
the
idea
of
using
the
statute
in
its
broadest
sense
for
disclosure.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
we
would
say
that
you
compile
information,
that
you
create
a
new
document.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
if
they
had
used
"secure
the
information"?
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
your
question.
if
you're
saying
when
the
fbi
in
this
case
would
initially
obtain
the
information,
that
if
at
that
point
they
had
done
it
for
law
enforcement
purpose?
well,
one
of
the
lower
courts
in
the
lesar
case
held
basically
in
that
case
where
the
government...
where
it
was
shown
that
the
original
records
that
were
obtained
were
obtained
for
a
non-law
enforcement
purpose,
but
the
government
went
back
into
those
files,
those
raw
files,
and
created
a
summary,
and
found
that
the
summary
that
they
created
was
created
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose;
and
decided,
the
court,
and
i
believe
correctly
so,
said
that
those
summaries
that
were
created,
which
were
created
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose,
were
in
fact
protected
under
exemption--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--i
understand
that.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
in
this
case.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that's
correct.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
again,
i
would
like
to
stay
with
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--decision.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i
would
say
not
exempt.
i
would
say
not
exempt
because--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--i
would
say
it
because
the
congress
when
it
was
adopting
the
amendments
to
exemption
6
was
doing
so
in
the
wake
of
watergate.
they
were
doing
so...
they
had
a
tremendous
concern
of
exactly
the
kind
of
abusive
use
of
information
as
we
have
in
this
case:
going
in
and
using
information
for
a
purpose
other
than
a
law
enforcement
purpose.
and
in
today's
world
when
it
is
easier
to
xerox
or
make
a
photostatic
copy
of
a
document
than
to
take
the
time
and
energy
to
go
through
a
document
and
only
take
those
portions
which
need
be
used,
i
think
that
if
you
hold
in
your
case
that
a
photostat
would
at
all
times
be
protected,
then
you're
encouraging
people--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--the
original...
there
is
no
question
even
here
that
the
original
documents,
the
raw
investigatory
files
from
which
this
information
was
obtained,
are
still
protected
under
whatever
exemption--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--as
to
the
document
that
was
created.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
yes.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
no.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
based
on...
was
recognizing
that
there
certainly
may
be
xeroxes
of
prior
files.
i
think
that
that's...
i
certainly
can
understand
that
decision.
as
i
said,
we
come
from
a
position--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--yes.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
because
exemption
7...
there
are
nine
exemptions.
some
of
the
other
exemptions
go
to
information--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--seven
goes
to
documents
created
for
a
specific
purpose,
and
whether
or
not
that
purpose--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--i
think
that's
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
mean
that's
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
at
this
moment
i
haven't
cross
complained,
you
know,
cross
filed
on
their
opinion
and
i'm
willing
to
stand
behind
their
opinion.
i
was
just
saying
that
i
think
that
from
the
congressional
intent
behind
it,
it
would
seem
that
any
time
you
reuse
documents
or
information,
whether
or
not
they
are
photostatic
copies,
you
are
reusing
them
for
a
purpose
and--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--that
is
correct.
and
i--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i'm
sorry.
the
word
"compiled",
the
issue
is
the
word
"compiled"
here.
what
i
said
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
word
"compiled"
in
its
narrow
sense
of
researching
and
creating
a
new
document,
whereas
i
think
the
word
"compiled"
in
its
more
modern
term
is
used
in
just
pulling
together
information.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that's
correct.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that's
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
we
are
willing
to--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--stand
behind
that.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
but
in
this
case
we're
not
dealing
with
the
photostatic
copies.
what
we're
primarily
first
dealing
here
with
is
the
issue
of
the
summaries
that
were
prepared
in
1969,
these
summaries
that
were
prepared
for
a
non-law
enforcement,
purpose.
and
this
court
in
nlrb
v.
robbins
tire
held
that
as
a
threshold
requirement
to
exemption
7
must
first
determine
that
the
documents
are
investigatory
records
compiled
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose.
and
in
deciding
that,
this
court
reviewed
extensively
both
the
legislative
history
and
the
clear
meaning
of
the
statute
involved.
in
this
case
it
has
been
undisputed
that
the
summaries
that
were
created
in
1969
were
created
for
a
non-law
enforcement
purpose.
quite
the
contrary,
it
was
held
that
these
records
were
compiled
for
a
partisan
political
reason.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
no.
in
respondent's
first
affidavit
that
was
filed
with
the
court...
it's
not
part
of
the
joint
appendix...
he
notes
that
he
started
this
investigation
because
one
of
the
eleven
individuals
was
running
for
the
united
states
senate,
and
that
individual
felt
that
his
defeat
was
in
part
caused
by
a
whispering
campaign
that
he
felt
was
based
on
some
information
that
the
white
house
had
obtained.
and
he
gave
the
respondent
the
cover
letter
which
is
attached
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
29,
and
it
was
because
of
that
that
the
respondent
submitted
his
freedom
of
information
act
request--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--i
can't
say
on
behalf.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that
is
correct.
i
cannot
say
he
was
acting
on
behalf
of
one
of
those.
he
was
at
that
time
a
journalist.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
the
respondent's
interest
is
to
find
out
what
kind
of
information
that
was
being
used
by
the
white
house,
and
to
determine
in
this
case
whether
it
was
part
of
the
information
that
was
used
in
this
whispering
campaign.
did
i
answer
your
question?
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
they
cannot
be
shielded
from
disclosure
under
exemption
7.
it
is
always
possible--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--yes,
but
we
cannot
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
they
may...
some
of
the
information
may
in
fact
be
protected
under
exemption
6.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
as
i
mentioned
before,
that
is
our
petition,
but
we
are
more
than
willing
to
just
rely
on
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
does
not
go
quite
that
far
as
to
disclosure,
and
would
only
go
to
when
they've
created
a
new
document--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--i
think
what
i
said...
if
we
go
back
now
to
the
district
court
and
you
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
i
think
at
that
point
we
will
probably
not
raise
the
argument
of
whether
or
not
they
are
or
are
not
xeroxed.
what
we
will
however
raise
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
those
attachments
were
in
fact
created
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
it
should
be
noted
that
out
of
the
record,
the
64-page
record,
there
are
only
really
attachments
as
to
two
of
the
individuals,
and
as
to
two
of
the
other
individuals,
from
what
my
brother
said
now,
i
gather
also
attachments,
there
are
no
raw
investigatory
files
attached.
the
entire
record,
the
64
pages,
has
been
entered
into
the
record
as
exhibit
n,
document
3
of
the
record
at
the
district
court
level.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that's
correct.
i
used
only
the
word
"create"
in
defining
the
word
"compiled".
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
word
"compile"
requires
the
creation
of
a
new
document
or
is
just
the
pulling
together
of
information.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that's
right.
they
basically
use
it
as
to
create
a
new
document,
and
that's
why
they,
i
believe,
felt
that
the
attachments
may
not
be...
may
still
be
protected
if
in
fact
they
were
compiled
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
we
believe
that
it's
the
terms
that
would
encourage
the
greatest
amount
of
disclosure
of
information,
and
that
the
words
should...
we
should
seek
those
definitions
that
would
encourage
the
greatest
disclosure.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
was
going
back
to
what
this
record
really
includes.
in
addition
to
the
fact
of
these
name
check
summaries,
this
record
includes
attachments
attached
prior
to
the
name
check
summaries
as
to
two
of
the
individuals...
or
actually
i
gather
four
of
the
individuals...
and
it
includes
a
very
lengthy
article
written
by
mr.
galbraith
in
the
saturday
evening
post,
and
also
it
includes
the
actual
advertisement
that
had
been
placed
in
the
new
york
times
for
the
anti-vietnam
war
moratorium
signed
by
the
individuals.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
this
is
what
was
part
of
the
document.
the
respondent
did
not
know
exactly
what
was
in
the
file.
he
did
not
know
that
the
article
from
the
saturday
evening
post
was
kept
by
the
fbi
as
part
of
its
file
on
mr.
galbraith.
under
petitioners'
argument
that
the
record
should
be
shielded
under
exemption
7
if
its
information
was
once
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
it
would
shield
future
records
even
if
the
information
is
recompiled
for
a
partisan
political
reason.
this
position,
of
course,
totally
dilutes
the
public
accountability
that
congress
meant
to
strengthen
in
the
1974
act
amendment.
with
respect
to
those
amendments
it's
important
to
note
that
the
senate
floor
manager
of
the
1974
amendments
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
with
respect
to
the
soon
to
be
adopted
amendment...
this
was
back
in
'74...
and
i
quote,
"not
even
the
fbi
should
be
placed
beyond
the
law,
the
freedom
of
information
law.
"
"watergate
has
shown
us
that
unreviewability
and
unaccountability
in
government
agencies
breeds
irresponsibility
of
government
officials.
"
as
i
say,
petitioners'
position
is
at
odds
both
with
the
legislative
history
and
with
the
statutory
construction.
under
petitioners'
position
we
basically
should...
one
would
have
to
use
two
different
ideas
of
records:
one
record
for
the
threshold
test,
whether
or
not
it
was
compiled
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose;
and
other
records,
the
records
that
someone
wants
to
be
disclosed,
for
the
second
test,
the
specific
harm
that
might
be
done.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
exemption
7
does
not
talk
in
terms
of
two
different
records.
in
talks
in
one
record,
and
it
is
very
clear
that
they
are
not
accepting...
the
statute
is
very
clear
that
it's
just
one
record
to
be
reviewed
and
to
be
determined.
in
addition,
their
position
is
totally
unworkable.
it
would
add
a
greater
burden
on
the
courts
and
the
agencies
to
determine.
as
i've
mentioned,
the
lower
courts
have
not
yet
decided
on
what
the
original
purpose
for
the
information
was
when
being
compiled.
and
even
petitioners'
documents
show
that
they
have
been
unable
to
find
the
actual
source
of
all
the
information
in
question,
as
noted
in
affidavits
that
they
have
submitted
and
included
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
19.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
as
my
brother
mentioned
earlier,
the
word
"record"
is
nowhere
defined
in
the
freedom
of
information
act.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
it's
very
difficult.
i
think
the
reason
that
the
term
"record"
is
defined
the
way
it
is
in
the
privacy
act
is
the
privacy
act
was
specifically
looking
at
computers,
considering
computers
when
it
was
passed.
but
yes,
i
would
say
every
time
you
push
that
button
and
print
out
that
sheet,
you
created
a
new
record.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
well,
i
think
in
an
earlier
case
that
was
argued
here--
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
--do
that,
or
computer
information
is
also
transmitted
by
just
exchanging
the
discs
that
the
information
is
on.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
i
know
i
don't.
[laughter]
i
think
it's
important
here
to
note
that
the
petitioners
made
a
conscientious
litigation
decision
not
to
raise
exemption
6.
they
have
attempted
to
change
exemption
7
into
a
broad
privacy
exemption
in
their
argument
of
privacy.
exemption
6
is
a
privacy
exemption.
as
mentioned,
they
did
originally
raise
it
when
they
originally
refused
to
give
the
respondent
any
access
to
any
of
the
documents,
but
they
did
not
raise
it
at
the
district
court
level.
and
after
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
information
was
not
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
and
instead
of
releasing
the
information
at
that
time
gave
petitioners
another
chance
to
show
that
the
information
was
in
fact
exempt
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
petitioners
still
did
not
raise
exemption
6.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
oh,
there's
no
question
that
the
sub-part
of
exemption
7
does
talk
in
terms
of
invasion
of
privacy.
it's
a
question
of
a
standard.
the
exemption
7,
you
must
first
reach
the
threshold
question.
if
you're
just
dealing
with
privacy,
exemption
6
does
not
require
the
threshold
question
of
it
being
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
ms.
sharon
t.
nelson
but
it
is
a
higher
standard,
and
as
petitioner
did
finally
shed
light
onto
why
they
might
not
have
raised
exemption
6
earlier,
it
is
a
higher
standard;
and
it's
a
higher
standard
to
be
considered.
when
you're
talking
about
eleven
public
figures,
some
of
whom
are
no
longer
living,
individuals;
when
the
petitioners
made
no
attempt
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
any
of
these
individuals
are
concerned
about
the
disclosure
that
are
in
the
question;
where
it's
shown,
as
i
mentioned,
that
respondent
began
this
investigation...
began
his
search
for
this
information
because
of
one
of
the
eleven
individuals
making
him
aware
of
the
file,
which
petitioners
have
been
aware
of;
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no...
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
information
in
these
files
have
already
been
included...
been
dispersed
into
the
public
domain...
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there's
a
question
of
how
some
of
this
information
was
used,
and
if
it
was
in
fact
used
previously,
it
was
dispersed
already.
respondent
has
no
way
of
deciding
what
this
information
is
without
seeing
the
information.
no
court
has
viewed
this
information
in
camera.
so
we
at
this
time
can
only
understand
that
it
must
not
reach
that
higher
standard
of
exemption
6
type
of
privacy.
thank
you
very
much.
