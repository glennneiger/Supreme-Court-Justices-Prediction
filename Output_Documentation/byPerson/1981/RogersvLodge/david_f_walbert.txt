mr.
david
f.
walbert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
one
issue
underlies
every
decision
of
this
court
that
has
dealt
with
this
matter
of
legislative
reapportionment
of
racial
discrimination,
starting
with
whitcomb
and
going
to
white
versus
regester,
burns
versus
fordsen
and
the
mobile
case.
that
issue
is
when
the
normal
political
process
is
going
on
in
any
community,
when
there
is
the
regular
give
and
take
and
black
people
or
any
racial
minority
may
lose
at
the
polls
in
that
circumstance,
that's
too
bad.
and
that's
part
of
the
political
process,
that's
the
give
and
take
that
i
think
justice
stevens
is
talking
about
in
the
mobile
case.
it's
not
the
role
of
this
court
to
sit
back
as
the
political
arbiter
for
the
united
states
and
say
well,
there
are
not
enough
blacks
elected
in
this
county,
there's
not
enough
in
this
county
and
so
on
and
intercede.
that's
obviously
a
political
question
and
is
not
a
constitutional
question.
but
i
think
the
one
thing
that
does
characterize
all
of
the
court's
decisions
and
starting
with
whitcomb
versus
chavis
where
again
there
was
complete
intercourse
politically
among
blacks
and
whites.
black
people
and
white
people
were
in
all
the
parties
together,
they
ran
together,
they
were
slated
together
and
so
on.
and
the
difference
is
when
black
people,
when
the
racial
minority
is
totally
excluded
from
the
political
process
on
account
of
purposeful
discrimination,
you've
got
a
constitutional
problem
and
you
don't
have
the
normal
give
and
take
of
the
political
process
where
this
court
has
no
function.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
your
honor,--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
i
think
what
i'm
referring
to
what
the
court
has
held,
for
example,
in
white
versus
regester,
and
i
would
like
to
look
at
the
findings
in
that
case
and
what
was
relied
upon
to
find
exclusion
of
the
political
process.
and
in
white
versus
regester...
and
again,
justice
stevens
and
the
whole
court
in
the
plurality
opinion
distinguisher
white
on
what
ground?
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
mobile...
rather,
in
distinguishing
mobile
from
white
they
say
there's
no
evidence
there
of
any
real
exclusion
from
the
political
process
that
is
a
result
of
any
kind
of
discrimination,
purposeful
or
not.
and
the
question
here,
i
think,
the
first
question
is
what
is
this
kind
of
exclusion
from
the
political
process.
now,
i
think
this
case...
the
findings
of
this
case
in
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
show
as
strong
an
exclusion
and
omission
from
the
political
process
of
the
black
people
in
burke
county
as
you
could
possibly
have
in
any
case.
the
first
thing
that...
and
again,
let
me
refer
to
mobile.
the
district
court
in
mobile
made
a
finding
that
black
people
did
not
have
access
to
the
political
process.
that
finding
was
based
on
one
thing
and
only
one
thing,
and
that
was
racial
block
voting.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
that's
slightly
true,
statistically.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
your
honor,
i
don't
think
at-large
elections
i
don't
think
could
have
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
discriminating
against
women
since
they
don't
live
in
segregated
areas.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
all
right.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
that
varies
from
where
you
go,
place
to
place,
and
as
obviously
in
any
political
question
you've
got
to
look
at
the
facts
of
that
political
environment
to
determine--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
suppose
that's
probably
true.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
what
the
cause
of
that
is,
but
i
do
know
what
the
cause
is
in
burke
county.
i
think,
with
all
respect,
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
here
show
quite
clearly
why
it
is.
we
do
have
findings
here.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i'm
sure
that's
true.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i'm
sure
that's
true,
and
possibly
this
court
should
address
that
issue
in
another
case.
but
i
don't
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
burke
county
facts
and
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case.
because
we
show--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--certainly
not.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
would
certainly
not
draw
that
inference
in
terms
of
any
constitutional
conclusion.
we're
not
trying
to
do
that
in
this
case
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
we
are
certainly
not
trying
to
do
that.
i
think
that
what
we
have
shown...
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
certainly,
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
the
district
court
found
no
violations
of
the
explicit
right
to
vote
in
terms
of
casting
your
ballot
and
registering
in
this
case.
i
think
that
we
ought
to
read
exactly
what
was
found,
and
that
sentence
which
is
quoted
in
the
appellant's
brief
leaves
off
after
the
sentence.
which
is
that
there
were
no
violations
exactly
like
those
in
hinds
county
found
here.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
an
in
footnote
38
they're
referring
to
the
district--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i'm
sorry,
44a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
appendix.
reading
from
that
it
says,
of
particular
significance,
given
the
plurality
position
in
bolden
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
violation
occurs
only
when
there's
proof
that
the
right
to
register
and
vote
was
directly
impinged,
is
the
district
court's
finding
that
such
overt
conduct
was
taking
place
even
at
the
time
the
present
lawsuit
was
filed.
now,
the
evidence
to
support
those
findings,
which
i
don't
think
are
shown
is
clearly
erroneous
in
this
case,
were
overwhelming.
because
if
you
go
back
to
when
the
1964
voting
rights
act
was
passed,
you
find
a
refusal
by
the
county
from
then
on
to
provide
registration
opportunities
for
black
people.
there
was
on
registration
site
that
was
in
the
county,
in
the
county
seat.
that
was
a
829-square
mile
county.
the
evidence
is
undisputed
in
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
are
that
black
people,
because
of
their
tremendous--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
i
think
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there's
obviously
a
more
major
issue.
we
did
not
ask
for
specific
relief
on
that
question.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
again,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
would
be
not
looking
at
all
the
findings
in
this
case,
and
the
showing
that
the
exclusion
from
the
political
process,
the
inability
to
deal
in
it,
is
more
than
just
a
product
of
registration
discrimination.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
it
did
in
the
sense
of
this
particular
statute.
that
statute
is--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
addresses
that
very
well,
because
it
talks
about...
and
i
think
that
may
be
on
page
55a.
and
they
say
there,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
this
is
the
best
answer
to
that
question,
"we
conclude
that
the
remedy
ordered
is
not
only
permitted,
but
under
the
facts
presented
it
may
be
required.
"
"the
picture
the
plaintiffs
paint
is
all
too
clear.
"
"the
vestiges
of
racism
encompass
the
totality
of
life
in
burke
county,
discriminatory
acts
of
public
officials
enjoy
a
symbiotic
relationship
with
those
of
the
private
sector,
and
the
situation
is
not
susceptible
to
isolated
remedy.
"
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
this
is
no
longer--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
as
the
court
says,
it
was
only
because
of
the
court's
pressure
that
there
was
any
addition
in
registration
sites.
the
court
did
pressure
that.
that's
the
finding
of
the
court.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
he
was
able
to
accomplish
the
addition--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
your
honor,
there
was
no
specific
request
for
that.
the
district
court
did
quadruple
the--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--because
i
think
it
was
very
clear
to
us
that
it
really
would
not
have
remedied
the
problem.
the
exclusion--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--your
honor,
under...
the
at-large
election
system
is
really
the
linchpin
in
the
entire
structure
here
which
keeps
black
people
out
of
the
pri--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--that's
not
true,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
black
majority
county
anymore.
i'd
like
correct
that
allegation.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
1960
census,
they
were
saying.
at
the
time
of
trial,
and--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--your
honor,
speaking
of
majority.
the
voting
age
population.
there
is
a
substantial
disparity
between
actual
population
and
voting
age
population
in
this
county.
if
you
go
to
voting
age
population--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--at
the
time
of
trial
and
according
to
the
1980
census,
which
is
the
most
recent
thing
we
have,
it
is
a
black
minority
county
by
voting
age
population.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
it
was
the
1980
census.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
it's
about
47
%
is
the
percentage
of
blacks
at
this
time
in
the
county.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
no,
it's
essentially
homogenous
in
terms
of--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--the
census
data
that
is
in
the
record
shows
that,
yes.
i
think,
your
honor,
too,
to
look
at
these
other
exclusionary
factors.
let's
look
at
the
democratic
party
which
is
being
always
continually
belittled
as
being
insignificant
in
this
county.
the
democratic
party,
the
democratic
executive...
it's
a
one-county
party.
it's
still
the
old
traditional
one-county...
one-party
county.
the
democrats
are
always
elected
to
local
office.
the
democratic
executive
committee
contains
all
those
people
who
are
elected
to
office.
you
can
be
little
being
a
member
of
the
democratic
executive
committee,
but
unless
you
are
a
democratic
executive
committee
member,
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
do
not
hold
office
in
this
county.
so
you
can
say
it's
not
important,
but
it
obviously
is
very
important.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
there's
more
than
just
elected
officials
in
the
party.
to
take
some
examples,
people--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--no,
there's
no
formality
like
that.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
there's
two
reasons
for
that,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
the
district
court
in
a
way...
zimmer
was
still
the
law,
in
a
way,
in
the
fifth
circuit.
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
clearly
says,
though,
in
this
case,
judge
alaimo
did
something
more
than
just
a
zimmer
analysis.
and
remember
what
the
zimmer
analysis
used
to
be
before
mobile.
that
was,
you
add
up
three
categories
and
if
you
win
on
two
or
three,
it's
a
legal
presumption.
it's
sort
of
like...
it's
a
game
almost,
in
a
sense.
judge
alaimo
did
this.
he
categorized
the
evidence
according
to
the
zimmer
categories,
and
i
think
he
was
right
in
doing
that.
but
it
does
not
create
a
legal
problem
like
mr.
leverett
says
because
of
this:
all
the
evidence
you
could
think
of
to
prove
intentional
discrimination
fits
in
one
zimmer
category
or
another.
to
say
that
you
outline
the
evidence
by
the
zimmer
categories
almost
says
nothing.
there's
no
defect
in
the
district
court's
opinion
because
he
organized
it
under
the
zimmer
categories.
for
example,
the
very
first
one,
the
first
zimmer
category,
is
access
to
the
political
system.
now,
i
can't
think
of
any
evidence
of
intentional
discrimination
in
using
the
at-large
system
that
really
wouldn't
fit
under
that
category.
i
think
the
question
here
is...
and
this
has
always
been
the
problem
with
zimmer
because
it's
so,
kind
of
an
amorphous
thing,
but
the
question
is
what
was
the
evidence
and
what
were
the
findings
underneath
those
zimmer
categories.
that's
the
key
thing.
not
whether
or
not
he
outlined
it
according
to
zimmer.
and
again,
let's
look
at
mobile
because
mobile
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
access
to
the
political
system
in
that
case.
that
was
based
one
thing,
and
that
was
racial
block
voting.
in
this
case,
it
was
based
on
much
more
than
that...
registration
discrimination,
exclusion
from
the
democratic
party,
which
is
vastly
more
exclusionary
type
of
evidence
than
occurred
in
white
versus
regester
where
it
was
just
some
kind
of
a
private
slating
organization.
we
had
the
freeholder
requirement.
there's
always
been
a
freeholder
requirement
to
run
for
county
commissioner,
and
that
has
a
devastating
impact
on
the
ability
of
the
black
people
to
run.
so
i
think
that,
again,
just
the
fact
that
zimmer
is
used
by
the
district
court
as
a
method
of
organizing
the
evidence
does
not
tell
us
that
there's
something
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
the
court
of
appeals
looked
very
closely
and
said
that
the
district
court
did,
in
fact,
make
a
separate
and
independent
finding
of
intent.
and
i
think
this
court
should,
in
some
part,
defer
to
that
decision
as
well.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
yes.
i
think
justice
o'connor
has
added
in
a
new
burden
on
the
plaintiffs.
it
said
it
as
a
sine
qua
non
of
prevailing,
you
must
prove
it
as
an
essential
element
of
the
case
even
if
you
proved
intentional
discrimination.
so
i
think
in
that
regard,
it
adds
something
in
that
mobile
never
talked
about
or
never
suggested
and
we
would
say
a,
that's
wrong,
but
b,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
appeal.
because
all
that
could
have
done
was
hurt
us;
it
could
not
have
hurt
the
defendant.
the
court
does
not
give
controlling
weight
to
the
question
of
responsiveness;
only
controlling
against
the
plaintiffs.
it
does
not
say
if
you
prove
it,
that's
a
strong
inference
or
presumption
of
discrimination.
it
expressly
says
that
in
one
of
the
footnotes,
number
of
which
i
can't
recall
offhand,
but
it
says
that
responsiveness
is
significant
only
in
its
absence
because
that's
failed.
it
does
not
accord
undue
significance
at
all
to
proof
of
responsiveness,
in
terms
of
inferring
discrimination.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
and
it
is
clear
and
the
court
of
appeals
reviews
the
whole
record
and
it
says,
this
is
what
was
done.
there
was
a
finding
of
intentional
discrimination
in
maintaining
the
system.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
and
that's
all
that
needs
to
be
assessed.
i
think
that
we
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
zimmer,
or
mobile,
was
followed.
and
i
think
there's
a
tremendous
scholastic
analysis
of
zimmer
and
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
and
you
can
look
here
and
you
can
look
there
and
you
can
make
something
out
of
this
language
or
that
language.
but
fortunately,
the
fifth
circuit
has
a
little
section
in
its
opinion
which
says
what
is
the
rule
established
by
zimmer?
and
that
is
on
page
39a
of
the
appendix
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
and
i
think
if
this
court
finds
that
that
is
inadequate,
then
i
think
mr.
leverett's
right.
i
think
the
case
should
be
reversed
as
to
the
finding
of
intent.
but
i
think
that
decision
of
what
the
rule
established
is
entirely
correct
and
totally
in
accord
of
what
the
plurality...
even
the
plurality
opinion
said
in
mobile.
and
that's
this:
first
of
all,
the
court
says
that
according
to
the
plurality...
and
again,
the
mobile,
the
fifth
circuit,
rather,
in
this
case
tried
to
follow
the
mobile
plurality.
it
didn't
try
and
go
off
in
any
other
direction;
it
tried
to
follow
the
plurality
opinion.
it
said
discriminatory
purpose
is
necessary
in
challenging
the
maintenance
of
an
at-large
election
system.
that's
the
first
thing,
and
that's
certainly
consistent
with
the
plurality.
secondly,
it
says
that
you
may
infer
intent
from
the
totality
of
the
circumstantial
evidence.
there
now
is
no
dispute
over
that,
mr.
leverett
agrees
with
that.
the
third
thing
it
says
is
an
essential
element
of
the
prima
facie
case
is
unresponsiveness
and
we
just
talked
about
that.
now,
the
next
thing
in
here
is
really
where
he
talks
about
zimmer
and
i'd
like
to
read
this
portion.
it's
about
three
sentences
and
it
says
this:
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--this
is
page
39a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
toward
about
six
lines
up,
eight
lines
up
from
the
bottom.
and
it
says,
the
zimmer
criteria
may
be
indicative
but
not
dispositive
on
the
question
of
intent.
those
factors
are
relevant
only
to
the
extent
that
they
allow
the
trial
court
to
draw
an
inference
of
intent.
the
zimmer
criteria
are
not
the
exclusive
indicia
of
discriminatory
purpose,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
not
factually
relevant
in
a
given
case,
they
may
be
replaced
or
supplemented
by
more
meaningful
factors.
even
if
all
the
zimmer
and
other
factors
are
established,
an
inference
of
discriminatory
purpose
is
not
necessarily
to
be
drawn.
the
trial
court
must
consider
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
ultimately
rule
on
the
precise
issue
of
discriminatory
purpose,
and
that
is
the
rule
established
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
that
complies,
in
my
opinion,
absolutely
100
%
with
the
plurality
opinion
in
mobile.
the
court
of
appeals
then
went
on
to
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
said
that's
just
what
the
district
court
did;
it
made
that
ultimate,
precise
finding
of
intentional
discrimination
and
intentional
motivation
and
purpose
in
using
the
at-large
system,
based
on
all
the
circumstantial
evidence
available
to
it.
and
the
evidence
here...
again,
it
just
pales
by
comparison
in
the
mobile
case,
if
we
look
at
that
case.
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
anybody
being
excluded
from
the
political
process
except
by
racial
block
voting.
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
of
being
excluded
from
the
process.
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
black
people
participated
openly
and
without
hindrance
of
any
sort
in
the
political
process
in
mobile.
true,
they
lost
at
the
polls,
but
that's
certainly
not
enough.
in
this
case
we've
got
continued
efforts
to
exclude
people
from
the
political
process
through
the
findings
of
the
district
court
on
voter
registration
and
not
allowing
voter
registration
to
be
accessible.
and
you
know,
it's
interesting,
you
know
voter
registration
has
been
restricted
in
this
county
since
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed.
you
say
well,
is
that
discriminatory?
well,
99.7
%
of
the
white
people
in
burke
county
were
registered
as
of
1968,
according
to
the
facts
in
the
record.
we
had
judicial
notice
of
that
taken
on
i
think
page
220
of
the
record.
so
when
you
talk
about
having
restricted
access,
and
making
it
very
difficult--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it's
a
very
civic-minded,
white
community.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
we
have.
the
only
thing
there
is,
chief
justice
burger,
is
as
to
georgia.
we
have
a
number
of
the
georgia
counties
in
there.
we
do
not
have
the
national
average.
there
is
also
evidence...
and
again,
i--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
it
was
negligible
in
1965
and
it
has
finally--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
think
it's
about
40
%.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
38
%
of
the
registered
voters
are
black,
and
62
%
are
white,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
the
percentage
of
whites
and
blacks
are.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
that's
not
right.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
exact
number
is
on
that
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
without
actually
calculating
that,
at
this
time.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
your
honor,
again--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
think
maybe
the
best
answer
to
that
is
the
only
other
written
order
i
know
of
that
judge
alaimo
rendered
in
this
case
showed
zimmer-type
factors
in
the
sense
your
honor
may
mean,
and
then
they
lost.
that's
the
mcintosh
county
case
that
mr.
leverett
referred
to.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
so
i
think
that's
absolutely
not
true.
i
think
you
can
look
at
the
record
and
see
that
that
did
not
occur.
and
this
case
is
an
extreme
case
in
terms
of
the
facts.
i
mean,
to
have
manipulation
of
the
voter
registration
process
in
1976
i
think
tells
us
a
lot.
i
think
to
have
the
county
commissioners
calling
black
people
niggers
in
the
county
commissioner
meetings,
which
is
the
evidence
in
this
case,
that
says
something
about
racial
attitudes.
i
think
the
refusal
to--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
sure,
the
voting...
yes.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
anybody
here
could
pass
the
voter
registration
test.
nobody
in
this
courtroom,
and
not
any
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
could
pass
the
georgia
test.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
constance
baker
motley
failed,
too,
from
what
i
heard
at
one
time.
but
i
think
that,
again,
the
evidence--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
the
best
answer
to
that
is
to
just
read
the
district
court's
opinion
and
read
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
and
i
honestly
think
there
can't
be
much
doubt
about
the
inadequacy
of
that
one
little
remedy.
that
is
part
of
the
problem.
but
i
think,
you've
got--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--that
would
not
help
the
democratic
party
exclusion;
that
would
not
help
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
black
people
cannot
campaign
in
this
county
because
of
the
deep-rooted
racism
in
the
county.
that
would
not
have
touched
that.
you're
excluded
from
the
political
party...
you
can't
campaign
in
burke
county
if
you're
a
black,
according
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
which
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
extreme
findings.
there
is
no
political
process
here
going
on,
justice
stevens,
in
the
sense
that
you
talk
about
it
in
mobile.
there
is
no
give
and
take.
that
doesn't
exist
in
burke
county,
and
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
is
that
characteristic
of
the
south
today.
in
fact,--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
i
think
that
an
interesting
thing
happened
after
the
district
court's
order
in
1978
which
was
ultimately
studied
by
this
court,
but
five
districts
were
set
up,
and
we
immediately
saw
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
county
five
black
people
qualified
for
each
of
those
district
election
posts,
pursuant
to
the
district
court
order.
i
think
that
speaks
quite
loudly
in
terms
of
what
would
happen
to
the
political
process
if
you
had
majority
black
districts,
which
is
inevitable
if
you
re-district
the
system.
that
is
absolutely
inevitable.
then
i
think
you're
going
to
see
a
complete
change
in
the
political
behavior
in
the
political
process.
i
think
that's
inevitable.
and
i
don't
think
that
isolated
remedies,...
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
an
isolated
remedy
will
not
do
it
in
burke
county.
there
is
too
many
dimensions
to
this
problem,
and
the
linchpin
of
it
is
the
intentional
maintenance
of
the
system...
and
again,--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
think
the
key
is
to
look
at
what
the
purpose
was.
i
don't
know
if
we
should
conjecture
about
this
or
that.
i
mean,
there
was
found
to
be
a
discriminatory...
the
purpose
here
was
to
discriminate
in
the
use
of
at-large
elections,
in
this
case
under
these
facts.
and
i
think
that's
really
the
key
to
it.
and
we
shouldn't
say
what
might
have
happened
over
in
mobile
or
what
might
happen
in
the
next
county
over
in
wilkes
county,
what
might
happen
in
augusta,
georgia.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
district
court
found,
based
on
all
this
incredible
evidence,
that
there
was--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--sure.
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think,
again,
something
is
very
clear
from
this
record.
and
that
is
black
people
will
be
excluded
so
long
as
the
at-large
system
is
maintained,
period.
that
can
be
remedied
only
by
having
a
district
election
system,
period.
those
two
things
are
unequivocal.
so,
to
remedy
the
existing
exclusion,
if
you
can't
do
it
by
keeping
at-large,
you
must
have
a
district
system.
now
certainly,
i
can
conceive
of
gerrymandering
the
system
so
you
could
have
allegations
of
racism
or
racial
discrimination
as
a
gerrymander,
and
that's
a
conceivable
problem.
but
to
say
that
districting
somehow
has
a
purpose
or
intent
to
discriminate
or
is
unconstitutional
i
do
not
see
that
that
is
possible
on
the
record
or
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
isn't
possible.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
your
honor,
i
think
we
don't
have
that
case.
i
think,
again,
i
think
the
key
thing--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
the
voting...
it
had
been...
if
you
look
at
from
1920
on--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it
would
depend
entirely
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
county.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
60
%
black
voter
registration?
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
suppose
you'd
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
blacks
had
any
possibility
of
becoming
a
majority
of
the
registered
voters.
if
all
the
other
barriers
were
removed,
and
in
this
county
it
is
clearly
impossible,
so
i
think--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
as
the
findings
show,
the--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
registration
has
been
made
inaccessible.
we
have
black
people
who
are
too
poor
to
get
to
the
polling
places,
according
to
the
finding.
they
can't
even
get
to
the
polling
places
in
this
county
and
the
state
law
will
not
allow
you
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot
if
you
have
no
money
to
buy
transportation.
if
you're
physically
handicapped,
you
can
vote
that
way.
but
if
you're
too
poor
to
get
to
the
polls...
and
i
think
an
expert
witness
called
by
mr.
leverett,
dr.
robinson,
testified
that
he
was
astounded
at
the
percentage
of
black
people
who
had
no
transportation
to
even
get
to
the
polls
in
this
county.
he
was
astounded
by
that
fact.
so
i
think
you've
got
to...
you
know,
under
the
precise
circumstances
of
this
county,
you've
got
a
very
severe
case,
justice
powell.
you
can't
really
say
what
would
happen
over
here
if
you
changed
this
fact,
because
you
don't
have
that
fact
in
this
county.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
of
driving
somebody
to
the
polls?
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i've
never
heard
of
a
statute
like
that
in
any
state,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
it
is
not
illegal
to
take--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it
is
legal
to
take
somebody
else
to
the
polls,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
number
limitations.
i
mean,
there's
limitations
on
how
many
people
you
can
assist
at
the
polls
that
might
be
construed...
maybe
that's
the
kind
of
law
your
honor
is
referring
to.
maybe
that
can
be
construed
to
make
it
illegal
to
even
do
that.
i
think--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
fifty-three
percent
of
the
black
people
in
burke
county
live
under
75
%
of
the
poverty
level.
they're
poorer
than
poor
in
burke
county.
the
people
in
burke
county
don't
have
the
money
to
rent
a
bus
to
take
the
other
people
to
the
polls.
that's
not
even
a
practical
situation
in
this
situation.
it
is
an
intense
and
extreme
case.
it
is
not
something
you
can
transfer
from
one
place
to
another.
i
think
i
would
finally,
your
honors,
like
to
mention
the
voting
rights
act
here
and
section
2
which
mr.
leverett
addressed
because
i
think
that
that
provision,
of
course,
has
not
really
been
ruled
on
by
this
court
yet.
and
frankly,
i
think
this
court
ought
to
decide
this
case
based
on
section
2
rather
than
getting
into
these
constitutional
issues.
our
position
on
section
2
was
addressed
by
the
court
in
mobile
by,
i
think,
five
or
six
of
the
justices
and
there
was
no
majority
opinion
under
section
2.
the
plurality
said
that
it's
the
same
thing
as
the
fifteenth
amendment,
no
more.
and
in
dissent,
justice
marshall
and
justice
brennan
said
it
is...
it
covers
effect
as
well,
and
it
covers
these
kind
of
practices,
and
justice
white
and
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens
took
no
position
on
section
2.
so
there's
no
opinion
of
this
court,
and
i
think
that
this
court
ought
to
seriously
consider
that
issue.
and
our
position
is
not,
as
mr.
leverett
says,
that
everything
with
any
impact
or
effect
on
black
voters
is
illegal
under
section
2.
our
position
is
simply
that
where
you
have
a
neutral
device
that
perpetuates
these
clear
consequences
of
past
purposeful
discrimination,
then
that
is
reached...
those
kind
of
effects
and
only
those
are
reached
by
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
plurality
opinion
we
can
see
one
problem
with
it
right
away,
and
that
is
that
it
holds
that
section
2
applies
only
to
outright
and
absolute
denials
of
the
right
to
vote
only
if
you
are
not
allowed
into
the
voting
booth,
and
that's
a
problem.
because
the
coverage
provision
of
section
2
is
exactly
like
the
coverage
provision
of
section
5.
that
is,
the
kind
of
practices
that
are
covered
has
exactly
the
same
language.
there's
no
question
about
that.
this
court
held
unanimously
i
think
it
was
in
allen
versus
board
of
elections
that
that
language
covers
at-large
elections.
so
the
only
question
i
think
we
really
have
to
recognize
that
the
plurality
was
in
error
was
with
regard
to
that
construction,
that
aspect
of
section
2.
and
it
really
should
seriously...
i
think
the
court
should
seriously
consider
that
issue
and
dispose
of
this
case
on
a
section
2
ground.
now,--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--they
followed
the
plurality.
they
followed
the
plurality
ruling,
your
honor,
and
they
just
followed
the
plurality.
they
said
that
we
did
not...
that
section
2
did
not
give
a
cause
of
action
above
and
beyond
what
the
constitution
or
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
in
its
own
right.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
oh
absolutely.
we
pled
it
in
our
complaint,
we
raised
it
at
all
stages
of
the
case,
and
we
presented
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
rejected.
but
we
do
rely
on
that
in
appeal.
now,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
on
this,
too.
there
is
attorney
general
katzenbach's
statement.
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
that
attorney
general
katzenbach's
statements
about
what
the
voting
rights
act
meant
are
very
important
because
he
wrote
it.
this
is
an
administration
proposal.
and
finally,
your
honors,
the
1981
legislative
history
confirms
all
this
where
the
members
of
congress
have
testified
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
an
impact
test.
thank
you
very
much.
