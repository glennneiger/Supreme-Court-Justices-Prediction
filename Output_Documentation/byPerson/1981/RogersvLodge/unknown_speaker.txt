unknown
speaker
both
in
the
same
wing
of
the...
what
was
formerly
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
leverett,
do
you
agree
or
don't
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
the
district
court's
action
as
having
found
intentional
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
but
they
concluded
that
the
district
court's
findings
should
be
read
as
finding
intentional
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we...
but
assume
that
we
were...
assume
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
that
the
district
court
findings
overall
should
be
read
as
finding
discriminatory
intent,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
i
suppose
we
could
still
say
that
both
were
clearly
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
are,
i
know
you
are.
but
is
that
the
only
issue,
that
two
courts
below
found
intentional
discrimination
and
that
that
finding
was
clearly
erroneous?
is
that
the
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree...
however
the
district
court
arrived
at
it,
do
you
agree
that
it
found
intentional
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
then
how
can
we
disagree
with
that,
especially
if
it's
been
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
without
finding
it
is
clearly
erroneous?
do
you
say
that
it's
because
they
had
an
erroneous
rule
of
law.
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
agree
that
the
thrust
of
judge
henderson's
dissent
was
that
it
should
go
back
because
they
had
not
given
appropriate
weight
to
the
mobile
holding?
unknown
speaker
mr.
leverett,
do
you
agree
that
the
district
court
can
properly
look
at
circumstantial
evidence
in
meeting
the
mobile--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
the
district
court
didn't
have
mobile
before
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
county
commissioners
are
rather
important,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
how
many
negroes
have
ever
been
elected?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
be
any
question
about
that
if
you...
if
the
fulcrum
of
your
statement
is
purposeful
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
i
suspect
your
friend
would
not
disagree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
is
it
probably
not
true
that
there
are
more
women
of
voting
age
in
the
united
states
than
there
are
men?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
ratio
of
women
holding
elective
public
offices
as--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i'm
getting
at
a
different
aspect
of
it.
unknown
speaker
there
is
only
a
small
percentage
of
elective
offices
in
this
country
that
are
held
by
women.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
well
in
the
country
as
a
whole.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
result
of
some
purposeful
discrimination,
or
is
it
just
the
disinclination
of
women
to
run
for
elective
office,
or
maybe
the
disinclination
of
some
voters
to
vote
for
them?
unknown
speaker
surely,
women
were
subject
for
many,
many
years
before
the
constitution
was
amended,
to
an
exclusion
from
the
political
process,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
conscious
in
the
sense
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
vote.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
not
bear?
you
said
no
one
has
been
elected
to
public
office
in
this
jurisdiction,
and
relatively
few
women
are
elected
to
public
office
in
this
country.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
someone
is
discriminating
against
women.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
draw
that
inference,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
reading
from
now,
so
we
can--
unknown
speaker
--what
page
is
that
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walbert,
did
the
district
court
grant
any
relief
for
this
particular
interference
with
access
to
the
polls?
and
if
not,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wonder
if
it
is
a
more
major
issue,
because
if
there
were
unrestricted
access
to
the
polls,
if
everybody
of
voting
age
voted,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
your
clients
would
be
better
off
with
the
at-large
system
because
you'd
have
a
majority
of
the
voting
age
population.
unknown
speaker
but
is
the
exclusion
from
the
political
process
something
that
the
court
had
the
power
to
remedy?
unknown
speaker
then
why
didn't
it
do
that?
that's
what
puzzles
me
about
the
case.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
clearly
answer
my
question.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
it
do
anything
in
that
regard
if
there
is
a
problem
of
access?
maybe
it
wouldn't
have
been
enough,
but
the
judge
apparently
didn't
find
impediments
to
the
polls
that
needed
to
be
removed.
unknown
speaker
but
he
didn't
enter
a
decree
that
had
anything
to
do
with
registration
sites.
unknown
speaker
and
that
puzzles
me,
because
if
it
was
as
serious
a
problem
as
you
indicate,
i
just
can't
understand
why
a
district
judge
wouldn't
have
done
something
to
correct
the
situation.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
more
surprisingly
then,
why
would
there
be
no
request
for
that
kind
of
protection?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
total
remedy
to
be
something
that
would
be
appropriate
as
part
of
an
overall
remedy.
unknown
speaker
well
it
wouldn't
be
if
there
were
unrestricted
access
to
the
polls.
then
you'd
be
better
off
with
the
at-large
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
speaks
as
of
the
present.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
census.
paragraph
11
alleges
the
population.
unknown
speaker
paragraph
11
deals
with
voting
age,
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
figure
again?
unknown
speaker
1980.
but
what
was
the
figure?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
characterize
the
53?
is
that
one
solid
homogeneous
unit,
are
there
any
hispanics
or
any
other
ethnic
groups?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
which
comes
first,
here?
are
they
elected
first
and
then
become
a
member
of
the
committee
or
do
they
become
a
member
of
the
committee
first
and
then
get
elected?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
executive
committee.
do
they
get
on
the
executive
committee
because
they
hold
an
elective
office?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walbert,
i'm
puzzled
by
the
district
court's
methodology
here.
on
page
71a,
the
district
courts
makes
the
finding
which
you
quote
on
the
first
page
of
your
brief,
i
think,
that
moreover,
it
is
evident
that
the
present
scheme
of
electing
county
commissioners,
although
racially
neutral
when
adopted,
is
being
maintained
for
invidious
purposes.
now,
there
are
two
findings
on
the
question
of
intent.
one,
there
was
no
intent
when
adopted
but
is
presently
being
maintained
with
a
discriminatory
purpose.
and
i
can
understand
a
district
court's
summarizing
the
evidence
which
led
it
to
that
conclusion.
but
if
the
district
court's
approach
is
consistent
with
mobile,
i'm
at
a
loss
to
know
why
you
went
through
all
these
so-called
zimmer
factors
later
in
the
opinion,
as
if
he
still
hadn't
covered
the
ground.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walbert,
i
guess
one
of
the
important
things
we
have
to
resolve
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
appropriately
articulated
the
standards
under
mobile
versus
bolden,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
placed
great
emphasis
on
the
finding
of
unresponsiveness.
is
that
a
requirement
in
your
view
of
mobile,
or
is
that
sufficient
under
mobile,
and
would
you
address
yourself
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
whether
it
adhered
to
the
mobile
standard.
unknown
speaker
isn't
this,
in
your
view,
this
is
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that
the
district
court
made
the
finding
of
discrimination,
and
you
don't
want
us
to
go
any
further
than
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
all
you
want.
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
on?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
very
high
percentage,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
throughout
the
country,
have
you
anything
in
this
record
to
suggest
what's
the
national--
unknown
speaker
--what
percentage
of
the
minority
population
are
registered?
unknown
speaker
it
was
practically
zero
in
1965.
but
currently.
unknown
speaker
38
%
was
the
figure
that
i
thought
i
recalled.
unknown
speaker
and
40
%
of
them
are
registered,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walbert,
isn't
it
probable
that
in
every
colored
jurisdiction
in
the
south
where
there
was
substantial
impediment
to
voting
prior
to
65
that
you
would
have
a
case
proved
upon
the
zimmer
factors
by
virtue
of
that
history?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
whether
it's
at-large
or
what.
whatever
it
is,
these
factors
would
prove
invidious
intent,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
tests
asking
such
questions
as
how
many
windows
there
are
in
the
white
house.
that
was
another
one,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
tried
and
i
failed.
unknown
speaker
that's
true
in
so
many...
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
whether
it's
the
district
boundaries
that
are
the
remedy
for
that
kind
of
very
plain
evil.
it
certainly--
unknown
speaker
--well
he
didn't
do
anything
to
remedy
this
kind
of
impediment
to
access
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
all
those
things
are
true,
i
don't
care
what
your
boundaries
are,
they
just
don't
have
a
chance.
unknown
speaker
the
irony
of
the
remedy
is
that
in
a
county
which
according
to
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court...
you
tell
me
the
1980
census
is
different
now...
the
majority
black
county,
he
divides
up
five
districts
and
gives
majority
whites...
the
whites
are
in
the
majority
in
three
of
the
five.
i
could
imagine
people
with
the
racially-discriminatory
purpose
on
the
white
side
of
the
ledger
wanting
that
remedy.
i
suppose
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
they
did.
unknown
speaker
would
this
remedy
be
unconstitutional
if
there
were
evidence
in
the
record
that
some
white
bigots
favored
this
way
of
getting
the
three-to-two
majority
control?
i
could
imagine
that
could...
you
know,
sometimes
people
of
the
same
race
have
different
views
as
to
what's
in
their
best
interest.
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
60
%
of
the
population
were
black...
60
%
of
the
voting
age
population
were
black.
unknown
speaker
but
when
this
suit
was
filed
you
had,
what,
53
%?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
you
had
60
%.
unknown
speaker
same
facts,
except
60
%.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
now
and
not
15
years
ago.
you
mean
if
a
black
shows
up
to
be
registered,
he
is
not
allowed
to
register?
unknown
speaker
in
some
states
there
are
statutory
prohibitions
against
rounding
up
voters
and
taking
them
in
in
a
truck
or
car
or
a
bus.
any
such
statutes
in
georgia?
anything
wrong--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
some.
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
in
georgia
that
would
prevent
someone
from
renting
a
bus
and
going
around
and
getting
voters.
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
rural
county.
unknown
speaker
so
one
limitation
would
be
money,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
that
issue?
unknown
speaker
so
your
section
2
argument
was
presented--
unknown
speaker
how
many
square
miles
is
it?
unknown
speaker
how
many
registration
sites
now?
