mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
duly
followed
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
mobile
versus
bolden,
in
holding
that
the
effect
of
that
decision
was
to
still
retain
the
so...
called
zimmer
criteria
of
voting
dilution
as
being
sufficient
to
establish
an
inference
rather
than
simply
requiring
a
presumption.
the
appellants
in
this
case
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
follow
this
court's
decision.
this
case
was
filed
in
1976
and
attacked
as
an
unconstitutional
dilution
of
black
voting
rights
the
at-large
method
of
electing
the
five
county
commissioners
of
burke
county,
georgia,
which
had
been
in
effect
continuously
since
1911.
according
to
the
1970
census,
burke
county
has
a
population,
or
had
a
population
of
18,235,
60.91
%
of
which
were
black.
this
case
was
tried
subsequent
to
the
court
of
appeals'
1978
decision
in
nevett
v.
sides,
holding
that
while
discriminatory
purpose
must
now
be
shown
in
a
voting
dilution
case,
that
it
could
still
be
proven
by
the
four
discriminatory
impact
factors
which
had
been
identified
in
zimmer
versus
mckeithen.
however,
the
trial
was
before
this
court's
decision
in
mobile
holding
that
the
zimmer
criteria
were
no
longer
sufficient.
the
trial
court
below
specifically
held
that
the
1911
law
had
not
been
enacted
with
a
discriminatory
purpose,
and
that
blacks
had
not
been
able
to
show
a
denial
of
specific
voting
processes.
the
court
concluded,
however,
based
upon
the
socio-economic
factors
of
zimmer
which
the
court
of
appeals
previously
had
resuscitated
in
nevett
ii
that
the
system,
quote,
"is
being
maintained
for
invidious
purposes.
"
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
appeal,
this
court
decided
mobile
versus
bolden.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court,
concluding
that
the
zimmer
criteria
or
factors
were
still
sufficient
to
establish
an
inference
of
discriminatory
intent,
but
that
the
only
effect
of
this
court's
decision
in
mobile
had
been
that
they
were
no
longer
sufficient
to
establish
a
presumption.
and
that
secondly,
a
finding
of
responsiveness
was
now
of
major
consideration
in
that
without
a
finding
of
responsiveness,
the
court
said,
there
could
be
no
establishment
of
dilution.
this
apparently
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
in
the
zimmer
case,
there
had
been
no
showing
of
lack
of
responsiveness.
in
this
case,
the
courts
below
relied
upon
the
same
three
zimmer
factors
which
had
been
found
insufficient
in
mobile...
slating,
unresponsiveness
and
past
discrimination.
the
added
factor
relied
upon
here,
which
was
socio-economic
status
that
had
been
depressed,
was
also
present
in
mobile,
although
not
denominated
or
articulated
as
such.
in
fact,
we
submit
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
even
stronger
than
it
was
in
mobile,
for
here,
unlike
mobile,
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
had
been
efforts
to
change
the
system,
which
as
pointed
out
in
justice
white's
dissent
in
mobile,
had
been
done
in
such
a
manner
as
to
indicate
the
possible
inference
of
discrimination
by
the
timetable
or
the
manner
in
which
the
attempted
repeal
was
made,
as
well
as
the
effort
to
come
in
and
bolster
the
system
by
in
1965
conferring
executive
responsibilities
upon
the
three
city
commissioners
in
mobile.
notwithstanding
this,
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
the
socio-economic
disparity
impact
analysis
of
the
zimmer.
in
the
companion
case
involving
thomas
county,
georgia,
the
court
specifically
reversed
a
holding
of
the
district
court
which
said
that
zimmer
is
no
longer
sufficient
after
the
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
mobile
case.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
evaluation
of
this
court's
decision
in
mobile,
and
we
say
that
even
assuming
that
the
zimmer
analysis
is
still
sufficient
to
establish
purposeful
discrimination,
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
failed
to
carry
the
burden,
and
the
decision
below
is
clearly
erroneous.
firstly,
we
submit
that
under
no
reading
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
mobile
case,
can
this
distinction
between
presumption
versus
inference
that
the
court
of
appeals
read
into
it
be
sustained.
both
in
nevett,
which
is
a
1978
decision,
as
well
as
in
its
companion
case
of
mobile
which
later
was
decided
by
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
below
stated
the
zimmer
test
in
terms
of
an
inference,
and
applied
it
as
simply
one
form
of
circumstantial
evidence
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
rule
52
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
is
significant
i
think
that
the
plaintiffs
do
not
make
any
belated
or
any
great
effort
to
support
or
to
defend
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
distinction.
the
court's
decision
continuing
to
treat
the
zimmer
criteria
as
being
sufficient
is
contrary
to
that
court's
own
decision
less
than
a
month
earlier--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
was
simply
commenting
when
we
recessed
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
was
contrary
to
a
decision
of
another
panel
of
the
same
court
less
than
a
month
earlier
in
the
escambia
county,
florida
case,
and
also,
it
is
contrary
to
a
recent
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
was
decided
about
a
month
or
so
ago.
now,
with
respect
to
the
other
aspect
of
the--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--the
eleventh
circuit,
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
with
respect
to
the
other
part
of
the
court's
decision
on
the
question
of
unresponsiveness,
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
are
apparently
in
agreement
that
the
court
is
in
error
with
respect
to
that
aspect
of
the
holding.
we
submit
further,
on
behalf
of
the
appellants,
that
while
the
matter
of
unresponsiveness
was
mentioned
in
white
versus
regester
without
any
discussion
as
to
whether
it
was
a
proper
subject
for
judicial
resolution,
that
consideration
of
that
type
of
inquiry
should
be
precluded
by
the
political
question
doctrine.
justice
harlan
stated
it
better
than
anyone
in
whitcomb
versus
chavis.
if
there
are
less
appropriate
subjects
for
federal
judicial
inquiry,
they
do
not
readily
come
to
mind.
now,
white
versus
regester
itself
does
contain
the
discriminatory
intent
requirement.
zimmer,
however,
does
not,
and
in
footnote
16
of
that
decision,
the
fifth
circuit
stated
unequivocally
that
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
should
be
on
the
effect
or
impact
of
the
legislation
being
challenged.
as
applied
to
burke
county,
georgia,
we
submit
that
since
the
court
below
found
that
the
at-large
system
was
not
enacted
for
a
discriminatory
purpose,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
striking
it
down
in
this
case
without
at
the
same
time
recognizing
some
constitutional
basis
of
at
least
some
degree
of
proportionate
representation.
this
is
so,
we
submit,
because
the
touchstone
of
dilution
seems
to
be
access.
the
evidence
here
is
that
in
burke
county
blacks
have
never
had
any
difficulty
registering,
voting
or
getting
on
the
ballot.
certainly,
since
the
white
primary
was
stricken
down
in
1946.
plaintiff
lodge
himself
testified
that
blacks
are
better
organized
politically
in
burke
county
than
whites,
that
they
hold
rallies
at
churches,
they
have
organizations
that
invite
candidates,
they
even
distribute
a
ticket--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--yes,
sir,
by
doing
this--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--that
is
correct,
but
by
relying
on
the
same
zimmer
analysis
which
we
submit
this
court
had
held
was
not
sufficient
to
do
that
in
city
of
mobile
versus
bolden.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
if
you
assume
that,
you've
assumed
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
the
point.
we
are
making
that
point,
too,
justice
white.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
the
basic
question
that
we
are
making
here
is
that
the
process
by
which
the
court
found
discriminatory
intent
is
fallacious
because
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
zimmer
criteria
which
this
court
said
were
impact-type
only
and
did
not
establish
discriminatory
purpose
or
intent.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
according
to
the
language
of
the
opinion,
it--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--they
applied
an
erroneous
legal
standard.
we
say
that
even
assuming,
in
this
case,
that
the
zimmer
criteria
are
still
valid,
assuming
that
mobile
had
not
even
been
decided,
that
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
did
not
carry
the
burden
and
that
the
finding--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--yes,
sir.
i
might
say
that
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
washington
versus
findley
that
just
came
down
deals
with
this
question
and
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
send
it
back
because
in
that
case,
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
the
washington
v.
davis
had
been
decided,
the
parties
were
on
notice
that
discriminatory
intent
was
necessary
and
therefore,
having
not
shown
it,
the
case
should
be
dismissed
and
judgment
entered
for
the
defendants.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
oh,
sure,
sure.
i
think
the
proper
approach
is
set
forth
in
this
court's
opinion
in
arlington.
the
four
or
five
factors,
the
sequence
of
events,
whether
what
was
done
represented
a
substantial
departure
procedurally-wise,
or
substantive-wise.
i
think
the
proper
application
of
that
is
well
illustrated
by
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
itself
in
the
escambia
county
cases
where
the
court
considered
that
at
the
time
escambia
county
adopted
at-large
voting,
it
went
to
it
right
after
there
had
been...
the
white
primary
had
been
stricken
down
there
was
some
arguments
made
in
the
newspapers
along
racial
lines.
that
is
the
type
of
proper
inquiry
that
we
submit
is
appropriate
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
mobile.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct,
sir,
it
did
not.
but
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course,
tried
to
rationalize
that
by,
in
effect,
saying
that
judge
alaimo
anticipated
bolden
and
that
he
did
find
discriminatory
intent.
and,
of
course,
we
agree
that
he
found
it
but
the
process
by
which
he
found
it
is
the
question.
and
that
is,
through
use
of
the
zimmer
criteria
which
are
disparate
impact
analysis.
contrary
to
what
district
court
held
below,
georgia
abolished
its
poll
tax
in
1945.
district
court
seems
to
assume
that
it
was
not
superseded
until
the
voting
rights
act.
georgia
did
have
a
literacy
test
which
was
enforced
until
the
voting
rights
act.
it
was
recently
repealed
in
the
1981
constitution
which
will
be
voted
on
this
year.
however,
in
burke
county
the
evidence
is
that
in
the
memory
of
no
witness
has
any
black
person
ever
been
unable
to
pass
the
literacy
test.
moreover,
the
evidence
was
that
there
had
never
been
any
effort
to
change
the
at-large
system
up
until
this
case
was
filed.
we
submit
that
in
applying
all
of
this,
in
light
of
the
evidence
in
the
case,
the
contention
in
this
case
ultimately
gets
down
to
this:
and
that
is,
is
inaction
unconstitutional;
is
there
a
constitutional
duty
on
a
political
subdivision
to
continually
assess
its
political
structure
and
change
it
simply
in
order
to
favor
one
group
that
says
that
they
are
entitled
to
elect
candidates
of
their
choice?
we
submit
that
the
answer
is
no,
and
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
city
of
mobile
case.
we
submit
that
the
zimmer
analysis
is
incorrect
not
only
because
it
reflects
a
discriminatory
impact
or
disparate
impact
analysis,
but
also
because
of
the
methodology
that
it
employs,
in
that
it
permits
the
court
to
grant
relief
in
a
voting-related
case
based
upon
violations
in
other
areas,
such
as
public
education,
public
employment.
we
submit
that
in
doing
this,
the
court
in
the
decision
violates
the
rule
that
the
nature
of
the
violation
determines
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
it
puts
the
courts
in
the
business
of
pronouncing
condemnation
rather
than
judgment
in
granting
reparations
rather
than
judicial
relief.
the
tendency
of
the
zimmer
analysis
to
become
preoccupied
with
this
very
thing
is
demonstrated
by
what
happened
to
it
as
an
evolutionary
matter
in
the
fifth
circuit.
originally,
there
were
four
factors
in
the
zimmer
analysis.
one
of
those
factors
was
slating.
in
an
early
case,
hendricks
versus
josephs,
the
fifth
circuit
said
this:
it
is
the
ability
of
blacks
to
get
on
the
ballot
which
is
at
the
core
of
slating.
yet,
in
1979
in
cross
versus
baxter,
the
moultrie,
georgia
case
and
the
adarian
case
from
mcintosh
county,
georgia,
the
fifth
circuit
completely
switched
over
and
said
no,
it's
a
question
of
success,
and
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
tend
to
merge
the
issue
of
slating
with
a
separate
zimmer
factor
of
a
history
of
prior
discrimination
which
affects
present
ability
of
blacks
to
have
access.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
district
court
denied...
or
held
that
there
was
a...
that
the
plaintiffs
had
established
a
lack
of
slating
requirement,
because
of
the
fact
that
there
were
not
anymore
blacks
on
the
democratic
executive
committee.
this
was
inspite
of
the
fact
that
the
undisputed
evidence
was
that
these
posts
are
filled
by
open
election
on
the
same
single-member
district
basis
that
the
plaintiffs
were
asking
for
in
this
case,
aside
from
the
fact
that
about
the
most
unimportant
and
insignificant
job
in
georgia
is
being
a
member
of
a
county
democratic
executive
committee
in
a
rural
county.
they've
never
done
very
much.
they
were
originally...
their
original
function
was
to
conduct
the
primaries,
and
that
was
taken
over
by
the
probate
court
in
1970.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
none
in
the
history
of
burke
county,
so
far
as
we
can
determine,
justice.
the
complete
submergence,
however,
of
the
three
other
zimmer
factors
by
the
one
dealing
with
a
history
of
discrimination
came
in
a
1978
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
kirksey
versus
supervisors
where
a
sharply-divided
court
held
that
it
was
now
only
necessary
to
show
a
past
history
of
discrimination
and
show
that
that
carried
forward
present
effects.
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
even
consider
washington
versus
davis
and
the
question
of
discriminatory
intent.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
remedy
case,
not
a
violation
case.
we
submit
that
the
bottom
line
of
the
zimmer
analysis
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
continued
to
apply
in
this
case
was
and
is,
as
the
dissent
in
that
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out,
reverse
discrimination.
i
would
like
now
to
address
the
question
of
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
which
has
been
argued
by
the
appellees
and
mentioned
by
i
think
all
of
the
four
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
court.
we
submit
that
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
adopt
a
disparate
impact
standard.
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
we
submit,
in
the
mobile
case.
the
fourth
circuit
recently
rejected
it
in
the
columbia,
south
carolina
case
in
the
same
terms
as
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
by
essentially
the
same
parties.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
rejected
that
argument
at
page
1364
in
footnote
11,
and
there
was
no
cross-appeal
from
that
holding.
and
we
submit
that
there
are
valid
reasons
independently
of
precedent
for
rejecting
that
construction
of
section
2.
first,
you
begin
with
a
rule
that
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statutes.
the
language
of
the
statute
uses
"deny
and
abridge",
and
as
the
district
court
in
the
uvalde
case
recognized,
these
terms
themselves
connote
intent
or
purpose.
secondly,
the
section,
in
using
deny
or
abridge
utilizes
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
most
specifically,
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
those
amendments
have
unquestionably
been
interpreted
as
imposing
a
discriminatory
intent
standard.
thirdly,
when
congress
wanted
to
adopt
a
disparate
impact
analysis,
it
knew
very
well
how
to
do
so
in
sections
3,
4
and
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and,
of
course,
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
is
that
where
in
one
statute
congress
uses
words
in
one
section
and
it
does
not
use
them
in
another
section,
the
inference
is
that
it
did
not
intend
for
that
section
to
have
the
effect
of
the
other
sections.
fourth,
the
statement
of
attorney
general
katzenbach
that
has
been
relied
upon
by
appellees
does
not
support
the
interpretation
that
they
place
upon
it.
the
attorney
general
was
not
asked
whether
or
not,
section
2
had
a
disparate
impact
test,
or
a
discriminatory
purpose
test.
he
was
specifically
asked
whether
or
not
the
word
2
would
cover
a
situation
where
a
political
subdivision
simply
just
didn't
open
its
registration
offices.
the
attorney
general
replied,
i
suppose
that
you
could
if
it
had
that
purpose.
so
here
we
have
the
attorney
general
himself
reading
a
discriminatory
purpose
requirement
into
the
statute.
now,
it
is
certainly
true
that
immediately
after
that,
he
proceeded
to
paraphrase
the
section,
and
in
doing
so,
we
submit,
inadvertently
utilized
the
language
of
sections
3,
4
and
5
rather
than
the
language
of
section
2.
the
casualness,
however,
with
which
he
did
this
invokes
and
brings
into
effect,
we
submit,
what
this
court
held
in
allen
versus
state
board
of
elections,
which
was
to
the
effect
that
in
any
case
where
the
legislative
hearings
and
debate
are
so
voluminous
no
single
statement
or
excerpt
of
testimony
can
be
conclusive.
in
that
case,
the
court
applied
that
principle
to
disregard
the
statement
of
assistant
attorney
general
burton
marshall
as
to
the
meaning
of
voting
as
used
in
the
voting
rights
act,
and
held
that
the
statute
would
be
given
a
much
broader
scope
than
the
words
of
the
statute
would
themselves
indicate.
now,
weighed
against
this
is
the
statement
of
senator
dirksen,...
stated
twice,
not
just
once,
as
this
court's
opinion
in
mobile
had
indicated,
both
at
pages
171
and
208
of
the
record
before
the
senate...
to
the
effect
that
section
2
was
simply
a
restatement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
to
which
attorney
general
katzenbach
acquiesced.
fifth,
we
submit
that
as
a
policy
matter,
this
court
should
not
construe
section
2
as
having
a
disparate
impact
analysis
in
the
absence
of
more
compelling
language
or
legislative
history
than
the
court
is
confronted
with
here.
the
reason
for
this
is
as
follows.
section
2
applies
to
all
50
states,
not
just
to
a
few
colored
states.
so
being
a
disparate
impact
standard
might
well
not
have
the
limiting
construction
that
this
court
placed
upon
the
effect,
purpose
and
effect
language
in
section
5
in
the
bier
case
where
you
held
that
the
law
was
concerned
only
with
laws
that
led
to
retrogression.
now,
if
you
do
not
apply
that
restriction
on
the
language
in
section
2,
this
would
place
in
doubt
the
validity
of
election
codes,
governmental
organizations,
the
districting
schemes
and
congressional
districts,
state
legislative
districts
and
local
political
subdivision
districts
all
over
the
country.
it
would
also
raise
serious
questions
about
the
validity
of
candidate
and
voter
qualifications,
and
possibly
require
a
validation
procedure
similar
to
that
used
with
respect
to
employment
tests
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
moreover,
imposing
a
disparate
impact
requirement
on
section
2
would
create
a
lot
more
mischief
than
it
would
even,
for
example,
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
reason
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
purport
to
protect
only
certain
people,
whereas
section
2
does.
and
at
least
under
the
fourteenth
you
would
have
to
consider
the
impact
on
everyone,
not
just
on
a
few.
under
2,
however,
it
protects
only
racial
and
language
minority
citizens,
and
a
disparate
impact
test
there
would
be
almost
mandate
for
reverse
discrimination.
i'd
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
left.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
take
issue
with
counsel
when
he
says
that
this
case
differ
from
the
facts
in
mobile.
all
i
can
suggest
is
that
the
court
read
the
district
court
decision
and
compare
the
findings
and
the
facts
there
with
those
in
this
case.
counsel
says
that
the
court
pressured
the
registration
sites
and
achieved
the
three
additional
registration
sites.
the
commissioners
voted
on
february
10,
1976
to
add
these
new
registration
sites
in
response
to
the
request
of
the
organization
that
brought
this
case.
this
case
was
not
filed
until
april
5th,
approximately
two
months
later.
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
sites
were
not
opened
until
a
week
or
ten
days
prior
to
the
election,
but
they
were
opened
in
response
to
a
request
and
not
in
accordance
with
any
pressuring
from
the
court,
and
the
district
court's
statement
to
that
effect
is
completely
without
any
evidence
at
all
and
is,
in
fact,
not
true.
counsel
made
the
statement
that
registration
has
been
restrictive
in
burke
county.
i
cannot
equate
the
fact
that
until
1976
there
was
only
one
registration
site
to
indicate
restriction
of
the
right
to
register.
burke
county
has
only
18,000
people.
the
plaintiff
himself
admitted
that
there
were
probably
not
more
than
2000
people
who
even
were
potential
voters
who
had
not
registered.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
about
800
square
miles,
which
is
about
a
square
about
28
to
29
miles,
with
approximately
18,000
people.
and
i
would
further
submit
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
notwithstanding
the
cries
about
we
need
these
registration
sites,
the
undisputed
evidence
is
that
in
one
of
these
registration
places,
only
50
or
60
voters
had
been
registered
by
the
time
of
the
trial
there,
and
another
one
less
than
100.
before
i
came
up
here
this
past
week
i
checked
on
it
and
it's
still
less
than
100
in
each
of
the
new
registration
sites,
which
indicates
that
they
were
not
needed
that
much
after
all,
anyway.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
at
least
three.
i'm
not
sure
about
the
one
in
goth.
i
asked
mr.
lewis
and
he
is
not
sure.
there
would
be
three
at
least,
one
at
sardis,
one
at
midville
and
one
at
the
county
site
in
waynesboro.
there
may
be
one
at
goth,
i'm
not
sure.
it
was
originally
established,
the
man
had
some
problems,
he
didn't
know
how
to
function.
they
finally
had
to
pick
up
the
cards
and
it
was
put
somewhere
else.
then
the
last
statement
was
made
that
the...
just
look
what
happened
when
the
court
ordered
relief.
of
course,
two
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
ran
in
that
election,
and
i'm
sure
that
there
was
some
encouraging
of
others
to
run
to
make
a
demonstration
of
response.
and
of
course,
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs
ran
after
the
plaintiff's
plan
had
been
approved,
which
deliberately
gerrymandered
the
lines
to
put
there
of
the
incumbent
commissioners
in
one
district
against
mr.
lodge,
and
they
even
tried
to
amend
it
to
put
a
fourth
one
in,
but
the
court
did
not
go
that
far.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
