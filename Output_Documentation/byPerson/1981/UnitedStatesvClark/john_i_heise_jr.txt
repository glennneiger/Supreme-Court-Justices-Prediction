mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondents
do
in
fact
focus
upon
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
we
contend
that
there
is
in
fact
no
ambiguity
whatsoever,
that
in
point
of
fact
employees
promoted
to
a
higher
grade
are
entitled
to
the
pay
implementation
provisions
of
5334(b),
and
so
the
court
of
claims
has
found.
we
suggest
that
we
can
focus
upon
the
fact
that
these
people
are
employees,
we
can
focus
upon
the
fact
that
they
were
in
fact
promoted
to
a
higher
grade
position,
and
therefore
the
pay
implementation
provisions
should
follow.
now,
it
is
important
to
ascertain
at
the
outset
that
each
respondent
here
was
in
fact
promoted.
the
promotion
didn't
come
after
the
pay.
the
promotion
was
in
point
of
fact
what
took
place.
that
was
the
event.
now,
the
wage
system
has
grades
and
had
grades
and
had
grades
way
back
to
immediately
post
world
war
two
period,
just
as
the
general
schedule
had
grades
and
has
had
grades
for
an
extensive
period
of
time.
in
like
fashion,
the
wage
system
has
steps,
and
we
point
out
in
our
briefing
and
the
court
below
appropriately
found
that
each
of
these
respondents
was
in
fact
promoted
from
one
position
to
a
higher
position.
this
was
conceded
below,
and
the
mechanics
of
going
beneath
or
behind
the
personnel
action
of
promotion
was
never
raised,
nor
does
the
administrative
record
support
any
position
that
it
could
have
been
raised,
because
these
were
in
fact
promotions.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
yes,
the
mechanics
of
the
promotion,
they
were
from
one
system
to
another,
but
in
point
of
fact,
in
examining
the
administrative
record,
it
is
clear
that
each
of
these
respondents
applied
under
a
merit
promotion
advertisement
program
for
a
position
at
a
higher
grade,
and
each
was
in
fact
selected
by
reason
of
the
qualifications
which
the
employee
had
demonstrated
in
the
journeyman
level
as
a
wage
scale
employee
or
wage
system
employee
at
the
lower
level.
so,
there
was
in
fact
an
individualized
treatment,
if
you
would,
for
each
of
these
individuals,
and
this
is
the
critical
part
of
the
case.
we
must
focus
upon
the
fact
that
the
statute
refers
to
two
actions,
promotions
and
transfers
to
a
higher
grade.
now,
transfer,
of
course,
involves
moving
from
one
agency
to
another
or
from
one
branch
of
the
government
to
another,
so
you
would
be
transferred
to
a
higher
grade
position,
but
each
of
those
types
of
actions
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statute
concern
the
individual
employee,
and
it
must
be
contrasted
with
the
mass
program
of
conversion.
if
a
group
of
jobs
or
positions
are
converted
from
one
type
to
another,
the
statute
would
not
be
applicable,
because
it
does
not
involve
the
individualized
concept
of
promotion,
and
in
this
case
each
of
these
boys
did
in
fact
move
from
the
position
of
ship
surveyor
in
the
wage
system
up
to
a
position
of
quality
assurance
specialist,
supervisory
production
controller,
engineering
technician,
and
the
like,
and
each
was
in
fact
selected
following
selective
processes
which
are
peculiar
to
the
selection
process,
in
competition
with
other
employees,
and
that
is
why
in
point
of
fact
below
there
was
never
any
contention
as
to
whether
this
was
in
fact
a
promotion.
now,
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
the
civil
service
commission
regulation,
now
the
office
of
personnel
management,
is
contrary
to
the
language
and
intent
in
congress
when
it
limits--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
no,
they
would
not
be,
because
the
concept
that
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor,
has
to
do
with
not
being
selected
as
a
result
of
a
competitive
program
or
not
being
selected
because
of--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--no,
both
would...
if
they
are
transferred
to
a
higher
grade,
that
would
be
a
transfer.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
if
it
were
a
promotion,
i
think
what
we
are
getting
at--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--if
it
were
a
promotion--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--one
employee
coming
from
one
area
could
get
a
higher
rate
of
pay
in
the
new
position
than
the
other,
just
as
if
i
am
a
gs
11,
step
2,
and
i
am
promoted
to
a
gs
12,
and
another
employee
is
a
gs
11,
step
5,
and
that
employee
is
promoted
to
the
higher
grade,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
first
employee
had
one...
a
lower
original
grade
pay
than
the
other
employee,
he
would
in
fact
receive
or
she
would
in
fact
receive
a
lower
rate
upon
promotion.
it
goes
back
to
what
you
were
receiving
at
the
time
that
you
were
in
fact
promoted.
now,
this
whole
concept
of
moving
across
the
country
doesn't
apply
here
and
normally
wouldn't
apply.
it
normally
wouldn't--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--this
is
correct.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
if
it
is
a
transfer
to
a
higher
grade,
you
would
not
go
down.
if
you
are
promoted,
you
would
not
go
down.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
well,
if
it
is
a
promotion,
it
is
going
to
be--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--well,
the
decision
of
whether
it
is
a
promotion
or
not
is
made
by
the
selecting
official,
the
operating
official
in
most
cases,
or
the
operating--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--oh,
no.
it
is
clear
that
if
it
is
a
promotion,
it
is
a
move
to
a
position
of
higher
responsibility--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--both
would
be
promotions,
but
the
one
individual
might
get
a
higher
salary
following
5334(b)
than
the
other
by
reason
of
the
salary
that
he
started
with,
but
in
point
of
fact
both
would
be
promoted,
and
i
gave
the
indication
that
this
is
true
in
the
gs
schedule.
if
one
employee
is
at
one
gs
level--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--because
the
individual
employee
is
selected
for
a
position
of
greater
responsibility
and
greater
duties.
that
is
why
it
is
called
a
promotion.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
the
standard--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--well,
yes,
it
does,
in
point
of
fact.
the
definition
of
promotion
does
in
point
of
fact
say...
talks
not
only
from
one
general
schedule
grade
to
a
higher
general
schedule
grade,
from
one
grade
to
another,
but
the
basic
concept
of
how
you
get
into
a
promotion
is,
you
are
selected,
and
in
point
of
fact
you
wouldn't
be
promoted
and
go
into
a
lower
salary
rate.
that
wouldn't
be
a
promotion.
people
wouldn't
apply
for
a
position
to
have
less
pay
than
they
originally
received
under
normal--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
well,
no...
well,
reduction
in
force,
you
don't...
you
are
not
promoted
under
reductions
in
force.
you
cannot
be.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--i
disagree
emphatically
on
the
terms
of
the
case
which
is
here,
and
under
the
normal
parlance
of
defining
why
the
employee
would
be
promoted,
because,
in
point
of
fact,
the
positions
here,
they
were
promoted
to
positions
of
greater
responsibility
and
duty,
and
this
is
the
parlance
of
promotion.
if
in
point
of
fact
they
were
moving
all
the
ship
surveyors
as
a
class
or
the
position
of
ship
surveyor
into
the
general
schedule,
a
movement,
that
might
be
a
conversion,
but
that
would
not
be
a
promotion,
and
you
must
understand
or
we
must
understand
in
examining
this
statute
the
difference
between
conversion
as
a
class
group
and
promotion
or
transfer
to
a
higher
grade
as
an
individualized
treatment.
i
therefore
do
take
exception
with
the
government's
position,
trying
to
equate
and
call
promotion
as
a
change
or
call
promotion
as
a
conversion
when
in
point
of
fact
they
are
different
types
of
actions.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
we
rely
on
the
administrative
interpretation
that
in
point
of
fact
these
employees
went
through
a
merit
promotion
procedure--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--there
is
a
regulation
that
is
before
the
court
which
talks
about
promotion,
and
that
is
found
in
5
cfr
531.202(h)(2),
and
that,
and
the
court
of
claims
referred
to
it,
and
said
promotion
means
a
change
of
employ
while
continuously
employed
from
one
general
schedule
grade
to
a
higher
general
schedule
grade,
or
a
lower
rate
paid
under
authority
other
than
subchapter
3
of
chapter
53,
which
would
be
a...
of
title
5,
which
would--
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
--well,
most
of
the
definitions
talk
about
what
is
the
accomplished
fact,
but
in
point
of
fact,
as
the
congress
talked
about,
promotions
being
a
promotion
in
duties,
and
this
has
been
the
generally
accepted
criteria,
when
you
move
from
one
gs
grade
to
another
and
you
are
promoted,
you
get
higher
duties.
when
you
move
from
a
wage
system
grade
to
a
gs
system
grade
by
a
promotion,
your
duties
are
more
complex,
as
they
were
here.
and
this
is
the
position
in
the
case,
the
more
complex
duties.
now,
to
focus
on
any
particular
definition
either
in
the
regulations
or
in
the
statute
which
so
defines,
the
answer
is,
i
cannot
per
se,
however,
because
most
of
the
regulatory
concepts
deal
with
what
happens
after
the
selecting
official
has
said
you
are
better
qualified.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
well,
but
in
the
legislative
intent
which
we
have
recited
in
our
brief
in
the
court
of
claims,
also
made
reference
to
back
in
1949,
congress
said
a
promotion
in
pay,
and
the
committee
report,
should
accompany
a
promotion
of
duties,
and
that
is
the
basic
concept.
you
should
get
more
money.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
i
think
they
used
promotion,
an
increase
in
pay
or
a
promotion
in
pay,
more
pay
for
increase
in
duties,
and
that
is
the
concept
that
is
built
into
this
particular
statute.
now,
if
we
test
the
government's
case
of
limitation,
we
feel
that
it
is
conclusive
that
the
statute
itself
on
its
face
certainly
doesn't
limit
these
promotions
to
only
within
the
general
schedule.
as
we
pointed
out,
the
legislative
intent
was
clear
that
an
increase
in
pay
should
accompany
a
promotion
in
duty.
under
the
government's
theory
in
the
case,
their
application
of
this
highest
previous
rate
rule,
which
is
an
administrative
regulation,
you
could
be
promoted
under
the
government's
theory
and
receive
no
increase
in
pay
whatsoever,
because
if
you
annualized,
if
you
would,
the
wage
system
salary
and
then
matched
it
over
under
their
theory
to
the
general
schedule
salary,
if
they
matched
exactly,
you
would
get
no
increase,
and
in
their
brief,
they
even
indicate...
the
government
even
indicates
that
under
their
theory
a
person
could
receive
less
salary,
and
certainly
congress
never
intended
that
in
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
claims
relied
upon,
that
an
increase,
a
promotion,
having
been
selected
for
promotion,
it
necessarily
follows
that
you
should
receive
more
pay.
mr.
john
i.
heise,
jr.
we
do.
the
court
found
it
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
if
there
is
any
question
about
how
this
movement
back
and
forth
has
developed,
we
suggest
that
the
court
can
example
the
proto
case,
which
we
have
cited...
i
believe
it
is
at
footnote
12
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
mr.
proto
was
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
case.
in
1968,
he,
as
a
wage
system
employee,
was
promoted
to
general
schedule.
then
he
was
changed
back
to
lower
grade
pursuant
to
a
reduction
in
force,
and
at
that
time
they
called
it
a
change
to
lower
grade.
he
moved
from
a
higher
grade
position
in
the
general
schedule
back
to
the
lower
grade
wage
system
position,
and
the
courts...
i
mean,
and
the
agency,
its
own
personnel
officials,
so
described
it.
then,
later
on,
he
moved
back
up
again,
and
then
he
was
demoted
back,
and
finally
the
action
which
is
before
the
court
now,
part
of
it
1973,
he
was
promoted
again.
so,
long
before
1972,
the
agency
itself,
this
very
agency
was
using
the
grade
concept
to
apply
wage
system...
to
apply
to
wage
system
employees.
now,
the
point
here
is
that
the
discretion
isn't
in
the
paying.
the
discretion
occurs
in
the
selecting
official.
the
personnel
official
and
the
operating
officials
who
call
it
a
promotion
then
set
up
the
criteria
for
the
employee
to
be
paid,
and
this
necessarily
follows.
now,
the
point
has
been
made
that
the
1972
legislation
impliedly
in
some
way
gave
rise
to
an
approval
of
the
regulations
which
the
civil
service
commission
had
promulgated,
and
this
just
isn't
so,
because
if
we
contrast
it
with
the
1954
legislation,
which
has
been
called
to
the
court's
attention,
involving
the
movement
of
these
crafts,
protective,
and
custodial
employees
into
the
general
schedule,
congress
at
that
time
specifically
stated
that
they
would
not
be
involved
or
would
not
be
construed,
or
these
actions,
i
should
say,
this
conversion,
congress
said
specifically
shall
not
be
construed
to
be
transfers
or
promotions
within
the
meaning
of
802,
which
is
the
predecessor
to
5334(b)
of
the
classification
act.
so,
congress,
if
they
meant
that
here,
in
the
case
of
the
wage
system
employees,
could
have
said
the
same
thing,
but
because
they
didn't,
the
obvious
intent
of
congress,
we
submit,
was
in
point
of
fact
to
include
them,
and
so
the
court
of
claims
found.
now,
the
point
has
been
made
that
the
civil
service
commission
representative,
in
making
his
remarks
to
the
congress,
pointed
out
that
this
particular
1949
legislation
involved
the
general
schedule,
but
we
contend
that
this
is
not
controlling
because
the
congress
in
its
committee
report
said
nothing
of
the
sort.
in
point
of
fact,
if
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
this
schedule
of
employees
from
any
of
the
language
of
5334(b),
it
has
had
ample
opportunity
to
say
so,
over
a
period
of
time.
the
1972
legislation
itself
dealt
with
nationalizing,
if
you
would,
codifying
what
had
previously
been
under
executive
order
and
previously
under
administrative
rule,
a
national
system
of
wage
board
or
wage
system
employees,
so
that
there
would
be
uniformity
in
grades,
or
i
should
say
uniformity
in
step
and
uniformity
in
concept.
not
uniformity
in
rate,
because
the
rate
depends
on
the
particular
area.
but
that
particular
1972
legislation
did
not
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
address
itself
to
the
issue
which
we
have
before
the
court
here,
namely,
promotions,
or
namely,
the
transfer
to
a
higher
grade.
we
feel
that
in
examining
the
1950
regulation
which
has
been
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
we
at
page...
footnote
20
of
page
23
of
our
brief
did
point
out
how
this
particular
regulation
has
vacillated
back
and
forth
to
recite
repromotions,
to
talk
about
promotions,
and
talk
about
a
number
of
things.
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
there
has
been
an
inconsistency
in
application
of
this...
of
the
statute
by
the
agency
below,
and
the
inconsistency
was
highlighted
in
this
very
case,
because
in
one
instance
they
applied
what
they
called
the
highest
previous
rate
rule,
and
in
another
instance
they
applied
5334(b)
in
essence,
and
respondent
libretto,
who
was
the
respondent
below
that
gave
rise
to
the
case
which
finally
arose
in
the
court
of
claims,
because
he
said
to
the
agency,
i
should
be
getting
the
benefits
of
5334(b),
he
at
all
times
claimed
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
two
step
increase
which
the
statute
provides.
so,
our
position
in
sum
is
that
the
court
of
claims
was
in
fact
correct
in
its
analysis
of
the
application
of
the
statute,
that
the
civil
service
regulation,
the
office
of
personnel
management
regulation
now,
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
