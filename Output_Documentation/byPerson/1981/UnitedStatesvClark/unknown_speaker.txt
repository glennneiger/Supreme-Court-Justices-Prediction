mr.
horowitz,
i
want
to
be
certain
about
one
thing.
does
the
government
concede
that
the
transfer
here
effected
a
promotion
of
these
employees?
unknown
speaker
that
they
were
not.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
claims
did
go
that
far
so
to
describe
it,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun.
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
opinion
states
that
both
parties
had
termed
the
actions
promotions.
unknown
speaker
have
you
changed
your
position?
you
say
it
is
arguable
now
whether
it
was
a
promotion.
unknown
speaker
but
are
they
then
promotions
within
the
meaning
of
5334(a)
and
(b)?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
the
case,
and
i
must
concede
that
for
a
court
of
supposedly
nine
generalists,
this
is
a
very
difficult
case,
because
of
the
very
technical
civil
service
and
opm
regulations,
didn't
the
court
of
claims
in
effect
declare
invalid
one
of
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
opm?
unknown
speaker
so
it
gave
no
deference
to
the
regulatory
authority.
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
can
i
stop
you
right
there?
i
guess
the
key
to
it
is
right
in
what
you
are
saying
now.
the
definition
of
grade
doesn't
purport
to
be
exclusive.
it
says
it
includes
those
in
the
gs
schedule,
and
you
earlier
told
us,
as
i
understand
you,
that
there
are
grades
in
the
ws
schedule
as
well.
now,
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
word
"grade"
could
not
apply
to
a
grade
in
the
blue
collar
schedule?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
not
also
admitted,
or
maybe
i
am
wrong,
that
if
there
had
been
a
promotion
within
the
ws
schedule,
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
claims
said
that,
but
that
is
wrong?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
the
5102(a)(5)
does
not
include
the
ws
separate
schedule?
unknown
speaker
if
you
know,
has
that
been
suspended,
the
in
grade
movement,
suspended
by
opm--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
problems?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
can
you
tell
me,
please,
whether
the
provisions
for
grading
within
the
ws
system
were
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the
general
schedule
statute,
section
5334
was
originally
adopted?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
the
overlap
between
grades,
you
refer
back
to
the
fact
that
a
gs
13,
step
10,
might
be
receiving
more
salary
than
a
gs
14,
step
1?
unknown
speaker
but
when
they
enter
a
new
grade,
at
or
near
the
bottom,
their
step
increases
become
more
frequent.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
let
me
just
interrupt
you
again.
when
you
say
the
regulation
was
first
published
in
1950,
does
that
mean
that
531.204(a)(1)
as
it
now
reads
was
in
the
same
form
in
1950?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say,
mr.
horowitz,
when
that
regulation
at
page
6
of
your
petition
was
adopted?
the
opm--
unknown
speaker
--no,
when
was...
yes,
the
one
that
you
quoted.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
more
question
about
the
regulation
in
its
pre-1965
form?
did
you
tell
me
that
at
that
time
the
classification
act
included
both
the
general
schedule
people
and
a
special
kind
of
craft
people?
what
were
the
craft
people
who
were
covered?
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
that
category
is
now
part
of
the
gs
schedule,
and
none
of
it
is
in
the
ws
schedule?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest,
do
you,
that
if
the
court
thinks
a
regulation
is
contrary
to
the
plain
range
of
the
statute,
that
it
must
defer
to
the
agency's
view
that
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
plain
range--
unknown
speaker
--then
it
is
just
a
question
of
who
is
right.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
court
was
wrong
and
the
agency
was
right.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
say
that
the
plain
language
supports
you
or
at
least
that
it
is
ambiguous,
and
you
disagree
with
the
court,
but
the
court
needn't
defer
to
your
view.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
but
the
promotions
were
from
one
system
to
another,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
heise--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
hypothetical
question
that
has
troubled
me?
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
wage
system
you
can
have
different
rates
in
different
parts
of
the
country,
and
supposing
in
one
part
of
the
country
there
was
a
very
low
salary
scale
and
in
other
parts
very
high,
and
the
same
position
in
those
two
parts
of
the
country
were
both
transferred
into
the
gs
system.
for
one
it
meant
a
reduction
in
salary;
for
the
other
it
meant
an
increase.
would
they
both
be
promotions?
unknown
speaker
well,
confining
ourselves
for
the
moment
to
the
transfer
to
a
higher
grade.
say
in
both
cases
they
were
w
system
grade
something
or
other,
and
they
had
the
same
title
on
the
grades
in
both
cases,
before
and
after.
one
would
still
be
a
promotion
and
one
would
not.
unknown
speaker
no,
transferred
to
a
different
grade
with,
you
know,
a
new
number
and
a
new--
unknown
speaker
--well,
how
do
i
decide
whether
it
is--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
moving
across
the
country,
but
the
gs
schedules
are
uniform
across
the
country--
unknown
speaker
--so
if
a
man
in
alaska
is
transferred
and
a
man
in
florida
is
transferred,
and
both
of
them
had
the
same
job
histories
but
had
very
dramatically
different
salaries,
so
that
one
would
expect
to
go
down
and
the
other
go
up.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
determine
whether
it
is
a
transfer
to
a
higher
grade
when
you
move
from
ws
to
gs?
that
is
my
question.
unknown
speaker
but
how
do
you
determine
whether
it
is
a
promotion?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
he
call
it
a
promotion
or
not
as
he
chooses?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
my
example...
please
stick
with
my
example.
the
same
change
in
responsibility
is
made
in
alaska
and
in
florida,
and
in
one
case
it
would
normally
result
in
a
lower
salary
and
in
another
in
a
higher
salary.
are
they
both
promotions
or
are
neither
promotions,
or
how
do
i
tell?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
the
gs.
and
what
is
the
reason
you
call
it
a
promotion?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
doesn't
define
promotion
in
those
terms,
though.
unknown
speaker
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
might
if
there
were
going
to
be
a
reduction
in
force
or
something.
well,
anyway--
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
heise,
do
you
disagree
with
the
statement
in
the
government's
reply
brief
on
page
1
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
where
they
say,
when
employees
are
gs
system
from
lower
paying
positions
in
the
wholly
separate
ws
system,
there
is
no
comparable
inherent
increase
in
responsibility?
unknown
speaker
what
statutory
or
administrative
definition
of
promotion
do
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
is
there
either
a
statute
or
a
regulation
that
defines
the
term
"promotion"?
unknown
speaker
but
that
just
uses
the
word
"promotion".
it
doesn't
define
it.
unknown
speaker
and
5
usc
5102(a)(5),
which
i
take
it
is
the
basic
statute,
simply
says
that
when
your
responsibility
increases,
you
get
more
money.
it
doesn't
talk
about
promotions.
unknown
speaker
well,
an
increase
in
pay,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
court
of
claims
struck
down
a
regulation?
