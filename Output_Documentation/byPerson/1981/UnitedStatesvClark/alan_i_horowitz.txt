mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
it
involves
two
different
pay
systems
for
federal
employees,
the
prevailing
rate
system,
or
ws
system,
which
essentially
covers
blue
collar
workers,
and
the
general
schedule
or
gs
system
which
covers
white
collar
workers.
each
pay
system
contains
different
grade
levels
and
different
steps
within
each
grade.
the
steps
are
different
gradations
of
pay
within
the
grade.
the
respondents
here
are
six
employees
of
the
department
of
the
navy
or
their
representatives
who
left
ws
blue
collar
jobs
to
accept
white
collar
jobs
covered
by
the
general
schedule.
after
an
administrative
error
that
had
given
five
of
these
employees
a
one
step
pay
increase,
after
that
error
was
corrected,
their
starting
salaries
in
their
new
gs
jobs
were
correctly
established
under
regulations
promulgated
by
the
office
of
personnel
management,
issued
pursuant
to
5
usc
5334(a),
according
to
the
so
called
highest
previous
rate
rule,
which
places
the
employee
at
the
nearest
step
above
his
old
salary.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
promotion
has
been
used
as
a
term
of
art
in
some
ways.
there
was
a
promotion
under
the
regulations
under
the
office
of
personnel
management,
because
such
promotion
is
defined
in
terms
of
whether
the
employee
receives
an
increase
in
pay
when
his
new
salary
is
established,
and
that
in
fact
occurred
here.
as
to
whether
they
were
promotions
in
sort
of
the
layman's
sense
to
a
position
of
higher
responsibility,
that
really
hasn't
been
developed
that
much
in
the
record,
but
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
assume
that
they
were
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
in
our
view
that
makes
no
difference
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
although
the
court
of
claims
primarily
relied
on
this
regulation,
5
cfr
531.202.
now,
the
question
here
is
whether
the
opm
regulations
that
were
invoked
in
this
case
are
contrary
to
law.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
we
don't
contend
that...
they
are
certainly
classified
as
promotions
by
the
navy,
and
that
is
because
of
this
regulation,
which
depends
on
whether
they
receive
a
salary
increase.
they
are
certainly
promotions
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation.
and
as
to
whether
they
are
promotions
in
a
more
common
sense
matter,
i
don't
think
that
has
really
been
determined,
but
we
don't
contest
that
they
are.
we
have
never
argued
that
they
are
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
they
can
be.
5334(a)
and
(b)
also
refer
to
transfers
in
there,
so--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
correct.
there
was
a
regulation
promulgated
by
opm
that
restricts
the
applicability
of
this
section
5334(b)
to
promotions
within
the
gs
system,
from
one
gs
position
to
another,
and
the
court
of
claims
declared
that
that
regulation
was
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
that
regulation
was
declared
invalid
to
that
extent.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
perhaps
i
should
read
section
5334(b),
which
is
the
focus
of
the
dispute
here.
"an
employee
who
is
promoted
or
transferred
to
a
position
in
a
higher
grade
is
entitled
to
basic
pay
at
the
lowest
rate
of
the
higher
grade
which
exceeds
his
existing
rate
of
basic
pay
by
not
less
than
two
step
increases
of
the
grade
from
which
he
is
promoted
or
transferred.
"
in
other
words,
when
an
employee
is
subject
to
this
section,
you
look
at
his
old
salary,
give
him
what
is
called
a
two
step
increase
in
his
old
salary,
and
then
transfer
that
into
his
new
grade
and
pick
the
salary
that
is
closest
to
that
and
higher.
now,
the
question
here
is
simply
whether
this
statutory
two
step
increase
applies
when
an
employee
moves
from
the
ws
system
to
a
position
in
the
gs
system,
as
occurred
here,
and
as
the
court
of
claims
held,
or
whether
the
statute
applies
only
to
promotions
from
one
gs
grade
to
another,
as
the
government
contends.
in
our
view,
this
question
is
unequivocally
answered
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
under
5
usc
5102(a)(5),
a
definitional
section,
the
term
5334(b)
is
defined
as
a
class
of
positions
included,
and
i
quote,
"within
one
range
of
rates
of
basic
pay
in
the
general
schedule.
"
end
quote.
section
5334(b)
provides
that
the
increase
in
salary
is
to
be
measured
as
no
less
than
two
step
increases
of
the
grade
from
which
the
employee
is
promoted
or
transferred.
because
respondents
were
not
promoted
or
transferred
from
a
grade
as
defined
in
the
statute,
that
is
to
say,
a
grade
in
the
gs
system,
they
do
not
come
within
the
language
of
section
5334(b).
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
agree
that
the
statute
says
includes,
but
i
think
the
only
reasonable
reading
of
that
is
that
that
is
the
definition.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
the
statute--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--right.
the
court
of
claims
said
that,
but
that
is
wrong.
a
statute
clearly
cannot
apply
to
a
promotion
within
the
ws
system,
because
blue
collar
workers
are
completely
excluded
from
subchapter
3,
which
contains
the
statute.
this
section
5334(b)
applies
only
to
the
gs
system.
now,
the
basis
that
these
respondents
have
for
arguing
that
it
applies
to
them
is
that
now
that
they
have
moved
into
the
gs
system,
they
are
technically
gs
workers,
and
it
is
their
new
salary,
but
any
salary
in
the
ws
system
would
not
be
set
pursuant
to
this
provision.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there
are
grades...
just
to
get
back
to
your
question,
there
are
grades
in
the
ws
system,
although
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
i
think,
the
term
1972,
23
years
after
this
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
those
employees
are
specifically
included...
excluded,
rather,
from
the
general
schedule.
again,
as
i
said,
justice
stevens,
these
employees
are
now
in
the
general
schedule
because
of
their
new
position.
now,
in
order
to
understand
the
reasoning,
i
think,
behind
the
restriction
of
a
two
step
increase
to
the
context
of
promotions
within
the
gs
system,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
digress
into
a
slightly
more
detailed
discussion
of
these
two
pay
systems
and
their
differences.
the
general
schedule
is
described
in
subchapter
3
of
chapter
53
in
the
civil
service
statute,
and
as
it
exists
today,
it
is
derived
largely
from
the
classification
act
of
1949,
and
it
was
at
that
time,
in
1949,
when
section
5334(b)
was
first
enacted,
although
it
originally
provided
for
only
one
step
increase.
the
gs
system
is
divided
into
18
different
grades,
most
of
which
are
divided...
further
subdivided
into
ten
steps.
now,
there
is
an
overlap
between
steps
in
the
gs
system.
that
is,
while
any
higher
grade,
the
same
step
in
any
two
grades,
the
higher
grade
will
be
a
higher
salary,
for
example
a
grade
14
step
1
salary
will
be
higher
than
a
grade
13
step
1
salary,
at
the
higher
steps
of
a
particular
grade,
the
salary
can
be
higher
than
a
lower
step
of
a
higher
grade,
or
to
give
in
example,
again,
a
13
step
6
employee
would
be
making
a
higher
salary
than
a
14
step
1
employee.
there
are
two
ways
in
which
employees
can
move
to
different
classifications
in
the
system.
first
of
all,
they
can
be
given
step
increases.
the
statute
defines
the
waiting
period
for
which
an
employee
must
wait
to
get
a
step
increase.
that
is
between
one
to
three
years,
depending
on
the
level
he
is
at,
but
once
he
satisfies
that
waiting
period,
he
is
given
a
step
increase
as
long
as
he
has
performed
satisfactorily
in
his
job.
getting
a
step
increase
does
not
mean
any
increase
in
responsibility
or
level
of
difficulty.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
am
not
aware
that
it
has.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
in
1949,
the
only
reference
to
the...
in
that
1949
act
to
the
ws
system
was
a
one
sentence
exclusion
excluding
blue
collar
workers
from
the
operation
of
the
statute,
and
stating
that
their
salaries
are
to
be
determined
according
to
prevailing
rates
in
the
industry.
now,
that
was
done
administratively
by
each
individual
agency.
each
agency
ran
its
own
ws
system,
so
to
speak,
conducted
its
own
wage
surveys,
and
determined
what
the
proper
salary
for
a
particular
position
was.
the
result
of
this
was
something
of
a
hodge
podge.
but
as
i
understand
it,
most
of
the
agencies
did
have
a
system
that
included
something
called
grades.
the
number
of
grades
varied
from
agency
to
agency,
and
a
particular
job
would
vary.
they
did
not
all
have
steps
in
the
sense
that
there
is
now
in
the
statute.
some
of
them
had
three
steps
within
a
grade.
some
just
had
grades
without
steps
at
all.
the
other
way
that
a
person
can
move
in
the
gs
system
is
by
getting
a
promotion
to
a
job
that
entails
more
responsibility,
and
in
this
case
he
would
move
up
to
a
higher
grade.
now,
the
operation
of
section
5334(b)
comes
into
effect
when
an
employee
is
promoted
from
a
high
step
at
one
grade
to
the
next
grade.
for
example,
if
an
employee
were
promoted
from
a
step...
a
grade
13
step
5
position,
if
he
were
simply
promoted
to
the
lowest
step
in
the
next
grade,
a
14
step
1,
he
would
actually
get
a
decrease
in
salary.
so,
under
section
5334(b),
what
is
done
is,
you
give
him
a
two
step
increase.
that
is,
he
was
a
13
step
5,
you
looked
at
what
the
dollar
figure
would
be
for
a
13
step
7,
and
that
dollar
figure
is
then
plugged
into
the
gs
14
levels,
and
he
is
given
the
next
highest
step.
in
this
example,
he
would
become
a
14,
step
2.
now,
the
wage
system,
although
it
parallels
the
gs
system
to
some
degrees,
is
quite
different.
as
it
exists
now,
it
is
set
out
in
subchapter
4
of
chapter
53.
these
are
amendments
that
were
enacted
substantially
in
1972.
the
main
difference
between
the
two
systems
is
that
the
ws
system
is
based
on
prevailing
rates
in
the
industry,
and
varies
widely
over
geographic
areas.
an
employee
performing
the
same
job
in
columbus,
georgia,
will
be
making
a
much
lower
salary
than
an
employee
who
is
performing
the
same
job
in
detroit,
michigan.
gs
salaries
are
uniform
nationwide.
now,
as
i
mentioned
before,
at
the
time
the
classification
act
was
first
enacted,
there
was
no
coordinated
ws
system.
each
agency
ran
its
own
system,
and
the
mechanics
of
each
system
varied.
some
grades
had
steps.
some
grades
did
not.
in
the
late
1960s,
it
was
decided
that
the
system
should
be
coordinated,
and
pursuant
to
a
directive
by
president
johnson,
the
agencies
got
together
and
developed
a
coordinated
wage
system
that
extended
uniformly
throughout
all
the
agencies.
again,
this
system
is
not
uniform
throughout
the
united
states.
there
are
geographical
differences.
in
1972,
the
coordinated
system
was
enacted
into
the
statute,
with
certain
changes.
one
of
the
changes
is
that
the
original
coordinated
system
had
only
three
steps
per
grade,
and
now
the
statute
provides
for
five
steps
per
grade.
one
other
difference
between
the
ws
system
and
the
gs
system
is
that
the
waiting
periods
for
step
increases
in
the
wage
system
are
significantly
shorter.
thus,
while
it
would
take
an
employee
who
starts
at
a
gs
step
1
18
years
to
become
a
gs
step
10,
in
the
wage
system
it
would
take
only
six
years
to
move
from
the
lowest
step
to
the
highest
step.
now,
i
think
it
is
the
recent
development
of
this
formal
ws
system
and
its
juxtaposition
in
the
statute
next
to
the
gs
system
that
has
made
plausible
on
a
quick
glance
the
respondent's
contention.
this
is
a
contention,
i
think,
that
could
hardly
have
been
suggested
by
examining
the
statute
as
it
was
first
enacted
by
congress
in
1949,
namely,
that
an
employee
who
moves
from
a
ws
grade
to
a
gs
grade
is
entitled
to
a
salary
increase
of
two
steps
in
his
old
ws
grade.
to
repeat
what
i
said
earlier,
this
contention
could
not
possibly
be
squared
with
the
express
terms
of
the
statute.
section
5334(b)
specifies
that
the
salary
increase
be
computed
based
on
the
employee's
steps
in
his
old
grade,
and
3,
the
gs
section...
"grade"
is
defined
as
a
rate
of
pay
in
the
general
schedule.
the
respondents
do
not
have
an
old
grade
in
this
sense
on
which
the
salary
can
be
based.
they
are
newcomers
to
the
gs
system,
and
the
statute
by
its
terms
can
only
be
applied
to
gs
veterans,
people
who
are
both
promoted
from
and
promoted
to
a
gs
position.
the
only
way
around
this
is
to
rewrite
the
statute.
now,
it
is
no
accident
that
the
statute
has
this
limitation
on
the
two
step
increase
provision.
the
purposes
of
the
two
step
increase
are
directly
relevant
to
this
context
of
promotions
within
the
gs
system.
because
of
the
overlap
between
grades,
it
is
a
common
problem
in
promotions
within
the
gs
system
that
an
employee
would
not
receive
a
salary
increase
without
the
two
step
increase
provision.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
that's
correct.
now,
the
reason
that
congress
was
concerned
about
this
is
that
in
many
cases
it
would
be
better
without
the
two
step
increase
for
an
employee,
for
his
own
salary
reasons,
to
stay
in
his
previous
job
and
refuse
the
promotion,
and
continue
to
get
step
increases
in
his
old
job
rather
than
take
a
promotion
and
get
either
a
lesser
salary
or
a
salary
that
he
would
not
get
as
much
of
an
increase
in.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
true.
the
step
increases
are
more
frequent
at
the
bottom.
over
a
long
period
of
time,
he
might
wall
be
better
off
anyway
taking
the
promotion,
but
in
the
short
term
he
would
be
worse
off.
now,
because
moving
from
ws
to
the
gs
system
is
really
moving
into
a
different
job,
the
same
overlap
considerations
are
not
present.
in
particular,
it
is
important
to
note
that
an
employee
who
moves
from
one
grade
in
the
gs
system
to
a
higher
grade
is
by
definition
receiving
a
promotion
as
we
talked
about
earlier,
that
is,
a
promotion
in
the
common
sense
notion
of
moving
to
a
position
of
higher
responsibility.
this
is
not
necessarily
so
when
you
move
from
the
ws
system
to
the
gs
system.
many
of
the
jobs
are
simply
not
comparable.
as
i
said,
in
this
case,
we
have
not
contended,
it
has
not
really
been
litigated
whether
there
was
an
increase
in
responsibility
here,
but
as
far
as
congress's
intent
in
passing
the
statute,
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
provide
an
automatic
two
step
increase.
similarly,
looking
at
the
1949
statute,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
cover
ws
employees.
back
in
1949,
congress
was
not
focusing
at
all
on
the
ws
system.
it
merely
excluded
them
from
the
provisions
of
the
classification
act.
moreover,
because
the
two
step
increase
depends
on
the
steps
in
the
employee's
prior
grade,
it
would
have
made
no
sense
to
apply
it
to
employees
coming
from
the
ws
system.
as
i
said,
the
ws
system
at
that
time
was
something
of
a
hodge
podge.
many
of
the
grades
did
not
have
steps
at
all,
and
if
congress
had
applied
this
provision
to
the
ws
system,
it
really
would
not
have
known
what
sort
of
increases
it
was
guaranteeing
to
the
employees.
even
as
the
system
has
been
refined
today,
it
still
makes
little
sense
for
this
provision
to
apply
to
promotions
from
the
ws
system.
i
think
the
best
illustration
of
how
respondent's
contention
diverges
from
congressional
intent
is
to
notice
that
the
steps,
the
gradations
within
the
grades
in
the
ws
system
are
larger
than
the
gradations
within
the
gs
system.
the
statute
sets
the
steps
in
the
ws
system
at
4
percent
increases,
so
therefore
the
respondents
are
actually
asking
for
a
greater
benefit
here
than
would
be
given
to
persons
who
are
promoted
within
the
gs
system,
which
is
what
the
statute
was
directly
aimed
at.
now,
the
court
of
claims
decision
rests
simply
on
its
placing
undue
influence
on
the
one
word
"promotion"
in
the
statute,
but
there
are
several
difficulties
with
the
court's
analysis.
first
and
most
obvious,
of
course,
is
that
it
omits
to
read
the
rest
of
the
statute.
more
importantly,
the
court
of
claims
itself
conceded
that
promotions
are
also
covered
by
section
5334(a),
the
general
provision
that
permits
opm
to
set
the
basic
rates
of
pay
for
employees
who
move
from
one
job
to
another.
therefore,
the
mere
fact,
the
mere
characterization
of
a
personnel
action
as
a
promotion
cannot
in
and
of
itself
determine
whether
it
is
properly
considered
under
5334(a)
or
5334(b).
i
would
like
to
turn
away
from
the
language
of
the
statute
now
to
discuss
the
consistent
administrative
construction
here,
which
we
think
is
also
dispositive
of
the
issue.
in
this
case,
opm
and
its
predecessor,
the
civil
service
commission,
has
consistently
adhered
to
the
position
that
section
5334(b)
applies
only
to
promotions
within
the
gs
system.
the
regulation
was
first
published
in
1950,
only
one
year
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
and
it
has
not
been
altered
since.
congress
has
apparently--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we
have
quoted
the
exact
form
in
our
brief.
it
is
slightly
different.
at
that
time
it
said
that
it
applies
to...
promotion
applies
to
employees
in
classification
act
positions,
i
believe.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
now,
the
reason
that
the
language
has
been
changed
from
employees
under
the
classification
act
to
employees
in
the
general
schedule
is
that
in
1949
and
for
a
short
period
thereafter,
the
classification
act
actually
set
up
two
schedules.
there
was
a
separate
schedule
called
a
crafts
protection
schedule,
i
believe,
and
section
5334(b)
also
applied
to
employees
in
that
schedule
by
the
terms
of
the
statute.
in
1954,
congress
decided
that
there
was
no
need
for
this
second
schedule,
and
all
those
positions
were
converted
to
general
schedule
positions.
so,
today,
to
talk
about
employees
covered
by
the
classification
act
or
employees
in
the
general
schedule,
that
is
synonymous,
but
in
1950,
had
the
regulation
read
in
the
general
schedule,
that
would
not
exactly
have
been
accurate.
i
am
not
sure
if
that
was
clear.
the
classification
act
has
been
amended
several
times
since
these
regulations
were
promulgated,
but
congress
has
never
made
any
effort
to
change
them.
the
regulations
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
and
have
never
been--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--when
the
exact
language?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
this
exact
language
perhaps
dates
back
to
1965.
i
am
not
sure
if
there
have
been
minor
changes
since
then.
i
think
it
goes
back
no
earlier
than
1965,
but
the
thrust
of
the
regulation
has
never
changed.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
they
were...
they
are
all
people
who
are
now
covered
by
the
general
schedule.
they
are
not
these
blue
collar
workers
who
are
covered
by
the
ws
system.
they
were
janitors.
it
was
called
the
crafts
protection
custodial
schedule.
so
i
think
custodial
workers,
guards
in
federal
buildings,
and
the
craft
workers,
i
think,
were
mechanics
who
repaired
things
in
federal
buildings,
things
like
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
in
1954
all
those
positions
were
converted
to
gs
positions.
i
think
it
is
particularly
significant
that
congress
made
no
effort
to
change
the
system
in
1972,
when
it
focused
on
the
ws
employees
and
enacted
special
provisions
for
ws
employees.
in
particular,
in
1972,
congress
gave
ws
employees
some
benefits
that
had
earlier
been
given
to
gs
employees,
such
as
the
retained
basic
pay
provision,
which
is
discussed
in
our
reply
brief.
yet
it
did
not
enact
any
provision
providing
for
an
automatic
increase,
both...
either
from
ws
to
gs
positions
or
even
for
promotions
within
the
ws
system.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
section
5334(b),
this
seems
to
be
a
classic
case
of
deferring
to
the
agency's
interpretation.
it
is
a
specialized
area
where
the
agency
has
developed
a
particular
expertise.
the
regulations
are
contemporaneous
with
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
are
long
standing
and
consistent.
indeed,
the
classification
act
of
1949
was
based
on
bills
that
were
submitted
by
the
agency
involved
here,
the
civil
service
commission,
and
the
legislative
history
reflects
the
commission's
view
that
this
section
was
in
accord
with
its
views.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
more
well
established
interpretation.
it
has
never
seriously
been
challenged
for
30
years,
and
indeed,
even
in
this
litigation,
the
respondents
did
not
allege
that
the
two
step
increase
applied
to
them
until
some
time
after
their
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
was
filed,
because
if
you
examine
the
petition
that
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix,
you
will
see
that
they
at
that
time
asked
only
for
the
one
step
increases
that
had
mistakenly
been
given
to
them
by
the
agency.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
we
say,
of
course,
that
the
plain
language
supports
our
position--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--but
that
there
are...
there
are
certainly
many
statutes
that
congress
has
enacted
that
are
ambiguous
and
can
be
read
either
way.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
in
those
cases
it
is
appropriate
to--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no.
only
if
they
find
it
ambiguous
should
they
be
deferring
to
the
agency.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
a
critical
point
here
is
that
there
is
just
no
way
to
decide
what
a
promotion
is
under
the
respondent's
contention.
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
promotions
in
the
regulations
are
defined
only
in
terms
of
salary
levels,
and
comparisons
between
grades
in
the
ws
system
and
grades
in
the
gs
system
are
also
only
in
terms
of
salary
level.
thus,
in
mr.
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
where
an
employee
moved
from
the
same
job
in
georgia
or
in
alaska,
where
in
one
case
he
was
getting
a
pay
increase
and
in
one
case
he
was
getting
a
pay
decrease,
it
is
clear
under
the
regulations
that
one
of
those
would
be
characterized
as
promotion
and
one
would
be
characterized
as
a
demotion,
and
the
relevant
regulation
here
is
5
cfr
536.201.
so,
the
only
way,
really,
to
deal
with
respondent's
contention
is
to
take
a
common
sense
view
of
the
word
"promotion",
to
look
at
whether
the
employee
has
gone
to
some
higher
responsibility
in
his
new
job,
and
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
it
leads
the
courts
down
a
path
of
looking
at
every
case,
whether
there
has
been
a
change
in
responsibility.
in
many
cases,
the
jobs
are
pretty
difficult
to
compare.
i
would
also
like
to
correct
what
i
think
is
a
misstatement,
and
that
is
that
the
agency
here
never
applied
5334(b).
it
never
gave
these
employees
a
two
step
increase.
it
gave
them
a
one
step
increase
under
a
misinterpretation
of
the
regulations,
not
of
the
statute,
and
in
fact
under
the
court
of
claims
decision,
the
respondents
here
ended
up
with
much
higher
salary
increases
than
they
had
even
gotten
under
the
original
mistake.
one
other
point
as
far
as
this
conversion
in
1954
of
the
crafts
protection
schedule,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
those
employees
were
within
the
classification
act,
so
if
congress
had
not
specified
that
this
mass
conversion
was
excluded
from
5334(b),
5334(b)
by
its
terms
would
have
applied
to
those
employees,
but
as
we
have
argued,
by
its
terms,
it
does
not
apply
and
never
has
applied
to
ws
employees,
and
that
can
just
be
seen
by
looking
at
the
definition
of
the
term
1954.
as
far
as
mr.
justice
stevens'
earlier
question
to
me
about
the
use
of
the
word
ws
system
at
the
same
time.
