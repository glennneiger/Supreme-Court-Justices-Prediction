justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
case
involves
the
relationship
between
the
two
principal
pay
systems
for
federal
employees
and
the
pay
treatment
to
which
an
employee
moving
from
one
system
to
another
is
entitled.
respondents
were
promoted
from
positions
and
the
prevailing
wage
system
which
covers
traditionally
blue-collar
jobs
to
positions
in
the
general
schedule
which
covers
traditionally
white-collar
jobs.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
respondents
were
entitled
to
a
two-step
pay
increase
when
they
received
their
promotions.
the
government
contended
the
statutory
provision
allowing
a
two-step
increase
upon
promotion
applies
only
to
employees
promoted
from
one
general
schedule
position
to
another
and
that
respondents'
pay
treatment
should
have
been
determined
by
reference
to
the
highest
previous
rate
rule.
the
statutory
language,
the
statutes'
legislative
history
and
the
consistent
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
all
clearly
indicate
that
the
two-step
increase
provision
does
not
apply
to
promotions
from
the
prevailing
wage
system
to
the
general
schedule.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
is
reversed.
