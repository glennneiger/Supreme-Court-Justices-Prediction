mr.
michael
s.
gruen
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
i'm
here
to
argue
for
the
preservation
of
one
of
our
subordinate
constitutional
rights,
namely
the
preservation
of
property.
that
constitutional
right
existed
in
its
full
sanctity--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
hope
not,
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
this
constitutional
right
existed
in
its
full
sanctity
in
new
york
prior
to
1973.
at
that
time
teleprompter
and
other
cable
television
companies
made
a
practice
of
seeking
owner
consent
before
installing
cable
television
lines
and
the
necessary
accompanying
equipment.
it
was
their
practice,
dictated
by
management,
to
solicit
consent
using
a
printed
form
which
you'll
find
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
32
to
33,
which
provided
specifically
for
compensation
at
the
rate
of
five
percent
of
gross
revenues
derived
from
the
building
on
which
the
installation
was
made.
effective
as
of
january
1,
1973,
executive
law
section
828
was
adopted
and
made
effective
in
new
york,
prohibiting
landlord
interference
with
installations
and
prohibiting
any
payments
to
landlords
from
cable
television
companies
or
from
tenants
with
respect
to
such
installations,
with
the
exception
of
purely
discretionary
compensation
which
could
be
made
by
the
cable
television
commission
with
respect
to
installations
servicing
the
tenants
on
the
property
on
which
the
installation
was
made,
and
then
only
if
application
was
made
for
it
within
a
very
short
period
after
the
installation
had
been
made,
some,
i
believe,
180
days
if
i
remember
correctly.
this--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--that's
right.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
there
may
be
no
compensation
for
crossovers
under
any
circumstances.
mrs.
loretto
then
brought
this
action
sounding
in
trespass,
and
the
sole
defense
remaining
after
the
elimination
of
a
number
of
defenses
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
section
828,
and
we're
presented
therefore
with
the
question
of
whether
there
are
any
extraordinary
factors
which
take
this
case
out
of
the
usual
rule
that
a
landlord
is
entitled
to
exclusive
possession,
and
particularly
to
exclusivity
with
respect
to
the
installation
of
permanent
installations
on
the
property,
particularly
including
television
aerials
and
the
like.
we
have
urged
throughout
this
case
the
observance
of
a
per
se
or
absolute
rule--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
no
distinction
was
made
between
commercial
and
residential
property,
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
rental
properties
in
general.
i
suppose
at
some
point
there
may
be
some
fine
tuning
on
that,
but
that's
how
it
stands.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
your
honor,
the
designated
class
is
the
owners
of
property
in
new
york
state
on
which
teleprompter
has
made
installations.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
not
by
the
giving
of
notice,
but
it
has
been
certified
by
the
supreme
court,
that
is
to
say
the
trial
level
court
in
new
york,
as
consisting
of
all
owners
of
property
in
the
state
on
which
installations
have
been
made,
with
a
minor
exception
which
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
into
here.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
who
are
all
of
these?
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
do
not
know
as
to
non-rental,
although
i
can
say
that
the
city
license
obliges
teleprompter
to
service
hospitals,
which
would
normally
be
non-rental
commercial
facilities.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
clearly
it
would
be
included
in
the
class.
i
can't
point
you
to
instances.
i
do
know
that
there
is
at
least
one
case
which
was
decided
in
new
york
city
which
deals
with
a
commercial
rental
property
on
which
manhattan
cable
television
had
made
the
installation,
not
teleprompter.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
you've
brought
me
to
the
exception
which
i
was
not
going
to
go
into,
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
there
is
an
exception
for
single
family
residences
on
which
the
installation
serves
the
sole
function
of
servicing
that
residence,
the
theory
being
obviously
that
the
owner
of
that
residence
has
in
effect
implicitly
invited
teleprompter
onto
the
property
to
render
the
service.
but
if
the
line
continues
from
that
television
set
on
to
the
next
property,
it's
a
crossover
and
then
that
owner
is
within
the
class.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
if
the
premise
is
a
non-rental
premise,
which
i
recognize
can
change
from
time
to
time,
but
if
at
the
instance
you're
talking
about
it's
non-rental,
then
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
section
828
as
not
covering
that.
so
that
the
owner
would
be
entitled
to
preclude
entry
by
the
television
company.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
well,
of
course,
it
he
wants
it
he's
welcome
to
have
it
in
and
he
can
allow
entry
to
the
extent
he
wishes,
precluding,
if
he
wants,
a
crossover.
we
have
urged
here
the
observance
of
a
per
se
or
absolute
rule
in
an
era
when
we
recognize
that
balancing
of
constitutional
rights
is
popular,
on
the
theory
that
it
is
traditional
in
the
area
of
physical
occupation
of
property
or
seizure
of
title
to
observe
a
per
se
rule,
although
this
court
has
seldom
had
an
opportunity
in
perhaps
the
last
century
or
so
to
apply
that
principle.
there
are
some
exceptions
which
i'll
mention
in
a
moment.
kaiser
aetna
for
one
states
that
the
right
to
exclude
is
universally
held
to
be
a
fundamental
element
of
the
property
right,
which
the
government
cannot
take
without
compensation.
and
even
if
the
government
physically
invades
only
an
easement
in
property,
it
must
nonetheless
pay
just
compensation.
in
st.
louis
versus
western
union,
which
is
an
1893
case,
this
court
held
that
the
installation
of
telegraph
lines
and
poles
in
a
municipality,
no
matter
how
de
minimis
that
installation
might
be,
constitutes
a
taking,
and
that
the
city's
use
of
the
top
cross-arm
of
the
pole
constitutes
a
taking
by
the
city.
there's
similar
dictum
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
causby,
1948,
and
one
might
also
look
to
the
delaware
railroad
case,
1928,
where
the
court
held
that
a
municipality's
direction
to
a
railroad
company
to
set
aside
a
portion
of
the
private
street
running
through
the
railroad
station
property
as
a
taxi
stand
constitutes
a
taking.
in
none
of
these,
i
submit,
was
there
any
balancing
approach
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
whether
a
property
right
had
been
taken.
the
balancing
approach
does
come
in
in
regulation
cases,
such
as
pruneyard
versus
robins,
where
the
court,
on
the
basis
of
the
ruling
made
in
california,
recognized
that
the
people
who
had
come
onto
the
property
to
distribute
literature
and
solicit
signatures
were
part
of
the
general
public
who
were
invited
onto
the
property,
were
properly
there,
and
were
present
by
virtue
of
a
special
invitation
made
by
the
owner
to
the
general
public
to
come
onto
the
property.
and
the
question
was,
to
what
extent
can
the
state
regulate
the
activities
of
such
people
or
the
activities
of
the
owner
with
respect
to
such
people
on
the
property.
the
regulation
concept
grew
up
entirely
distinctly
from
the
old-fashioned
physical
occupation
or
seizure
of
title
concept.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
your
honor,
there
certainly
are
and
there
are
in
new
york
as
well.
however,
we've
been
unable
to
find
any
instance
in
which
any
such
regulation,
first
of
all,
obliges
the
landlord
to
accept
the
installation
of
somebody
else's
property
on
his
property.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
permanently...
or
for
that
matter,
i
can't
think
of
any
unpermanent
one.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
telephone
equipment
is
a--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--that's
true,
your
honor.
and
to
my
knowledge
there
are
no
cases
which
oblige
a
landlord
to
permit
the
telephone
company
to
enter
property
and
make
installations
without
compensation
to
the
landlord.
it
is
certainly
very
common
that
this
happens,
we
recognize
that,
and
we
think
it's
because
landlords
recognize
that
telephone
service
is
desirable,
tenants
want
it.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
new
york
it's
very
clear
that
telephone
companies
are
obliged
by
statute
to
provide
compensation.
and
furthermore,
there
is
written
into
the
law
a
protection
for
the
practical
situation
where
the
landlord
does
permit
the
telephone
company
to
come
in,
as
in
through
an
informal
license,
without
requiring
compensation.
that
statute
says
that
no
prescriptive
easement
or
right
can
arise
as
a
result
of
this
informal
permission.
so
you
have
a
very
different
situation
from
section
828,
which
obliges
the
landlord
to
accept
the
presence
of
this
stranger's
property,
and
indeed
creates
a
very
strong
possibility
that
20
years
later
the
telephone
company...
the
cable
company
will
have
earned
a
prescriptive
easement.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
a
situation
would
be
defensible...
that
such
a
provision
might
be
desirable,
but
it
would
only
protect
as
to
a
voluntary
acceptance
by
the
landlord
of
the
presence
of
the
cable
facilities
on
his
property.
i
think
that
what
creates
the
problem
here
is
that
the
government
insists
that
the
landlord
allow
the
cable
company
to
make
its
installation.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
think
that
solves
half
the
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
no,
it
would
not
solve
it
all,
because
the
second
part
of--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--i
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
insofar
as
it
requires
a
substantial
expenditure
without
compensation.
we
don't
have
this
case,
but
i
think
that
what--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--well,
that's
true,
and
at
least
in
new
york
a
landlord
is
entitled
to
compensation
in
the
form
of
rent,
increased
rent,
for
making
such
improvements
on
his
property.
i
think
this
is
the
second
factor
which
distinguishes
our
case
from
the
safety
and
health
measure
cases,
such
as
sprinkler
systems
and
the
like.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
where
the
problem
is
presented
in
new
york
with
respect
to
such
rules
is
because
of
the
existence
of
the
pervasive
system
of
rent
control.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
would
certainly
say
that,
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
think,
of
course,
such
a
payment
would
have
to
be
made
in
advance,
and
i
assume
that's
part
of
your
question.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
it
doesn't
solve
the
entire
problem,
interestingly
enough.
it
changes
the
precise
location
of
the
easement
from
the
surface
of
the
roof
to
inside
the
wire.
here
you're
positing
that
the
wire
itself
is
owned
of
the
landlord,
but
the
cable
company
has
the
right
to
pass
its
signal
through
the
wire
without
compensation
to
the
landlord,
for
its
commercial
benefit.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
you're
asking,
supposing
the
tenant
could
make
an
installation
from
the
outside
of
the
building
to
his
particular
apartment?
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
think
if
obliged
by
the
government,
that
that
would
have
to
be
compensated
in
some
form.
and
i
think
that
this--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
think
i
would
not
have
a
problem
with
your
example
in
a
state
other
than
new
york,
which
doesn't
have
rent
control.
there
i
would
assume
that
the
landlord
can
set
whatever
rents
he
wishes
and
thereby
compensate
himself
for
the
expenditures
he
makes
in
improving
the
property.
new
york
presents
the
problem
that
there
is
no
way
of
a
landlord
compensating
himself
for
such
an
expenditure
other
than
by
a
permitted
increase
in
rent,
and
in
fact
i
think
that's
why
new
york
allows
for
increases
in
rent
for
virtually
all
of
the
examples
which
this
court
has
proposed
in
the
oral
discussion
now.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
there
are.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
there
was
one
very
recently
adopted
with
respect
to
smoke
detectors.
it
requires
that
the
tenant
pay
the
landlord
for
a
particular
price
which
is
the
presumptive
price
of
the
smoke
detector.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
that's
right.
and
furthermore,
that
the
tenant
maintains
the
smoke
detector.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
that's
right.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
of
course,
and
he's
indemnified
by
whatever
he
wishes
to
charge
in
rent
for
the
cost
of
the
sprinklers.
there's
a
slight
difference
between
a
smoke
alarm
and
the
cable
installation,
because
the
smoke
alarm
is
within
the
tenant's
own
apartment,
it
occupies
no
additional
space
not
let
by
the
original
demise.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
they
are.
i
think
they
grow
out
of
a
hypothetical--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--yes,
yes,
and
particularly
because
they
involve
some
measure
of
compensation,
i
think
that
they--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--they
certainly
involve
a
different
level--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
well,
as
a
landlord
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
tell
the
phone
company
that
i
don't
want
them
on
my
property.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
may
choose
not
to,
and
in
fact
most
landlords--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
yes.
but
it's
the
landlord's
voluntary
choice
not
to
charge
the
cable
company...
the
telephone
company.
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
charge
the
telephone
company
if
he
chooses
to.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
he
could.
he
may
get
relatively
few
tenants--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--it's
his
choice
with
his
property.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
might
choose
to
live
there.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
actually,
it
doesn't.
if
one
thinks
this
through
in
the
new
york
context,
it's
quite
clear
that
it
can't.
there
is
a
virtually
nonexistent
vacancy
rate
in
new
york
and
therefore
the
presence
of
cable
is
unlikely
to
add
additional
tenancy
to
the
building.
and
section
828
absolutely
prohibits
the
landlord
from
asking
increased
rent
because
of
the
presence
of
the
cable.
therefore,
you
have
no
income
to
capitalize
into
a
higher
value.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
think
quite
a
few.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
well,
the
payments
to
the
city
are
a
completely
separate
item.
the
payments
to
the
landlords,
according
to
one
statement
in
the
record
of
teleprompter
in
an
appendix
to
an
agreement
with
hughes
aircraft,
said
that
the
payments
to
the
landlords
continued
to
be
made
until
mid-1974
under
contracts,
and
at
that
point,
apparently
whether
the
contract
had
time
to
run
or
not,
teleprompter
simply
ceased
making
the
payments.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
i
agree
with
you.
you
understand
that
the
payments
to
the
city
are
entirely
distinct.
they're
made
under
the
franchise
agreement,
so-called,
with
the
city
and
they
consist
of
five
percent
of
gross
revenues.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
they're
a
different
five
percent.
it
adds
up
to
ten.
that
five
percent
to
the
city
is
paid
for
a
precisely
analogous
use
to
that
which
is
made
of
the
rooftops
on
our
blocks.
it's
for
the
use
of
the
city
streets
for
the
passage
of
cable
underneath.
and
i
should
make
clear
that
the
right
of
landlords
to
be
free
of
such
installations
in
new
york
or
to
be
compensated
for
them
if
they
chose
to
be
was
extremely
clear
under
case
law
in
new
york
up
until
1973.
there
are
innumerable
cases
which
stay
that
any
installation
made
by
a
tenant
outside
of
his
own
apartment
can
be
prohibited
by
the
landlord,
and
if
the
landlord
chooses
to
allow
it
to
persist
the
landlord
is
entitled
to
compensation
for
it.
in
particular,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
dealing
with
television
antenna
installations
on
rooftops,
where
the
courts
say
that
the
landlord
may
prohibit
it
or
receive
compensation,
and
rent
control
regulations
up
until
1973
provided
for
compensation.
i
would
propose
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes,
please.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
i
see
no
substantive
difference
between
section
828
and
such
a
regulation.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
yes.
i
think
the
rationale
is
that
essentially
the
constitution
as
viewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york--
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
--i
agree.
i
think
it
says
that
landlords
may
be
required
to
permit
any
use
of
their
property
which
doesn't
in
effect...
which
is
beneficial
to
the
tenants
and
which
doesn't
in
effect
utterly
destroy
the
value
of
the
property.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
"no
landlord
shall":
"(a)
interfere
with
the
installation
of
cable
television
facilities
upon
his
property
or
premises,
except
that
a
landlord
may
require.
"
"(1)
that
the
installation
of
cable
television
facilities
conform
to
such
reasonable
conditions
as
are
necessary
to
protect
the
safety,
functioning,
and
appearance
of
the
premises,
and
the
convenience
and
well
being
of
other
tenants.
"
"(2)
that
the
cable
television
company
or
the
tenant
or
a
combination
thereof
bear
the
entire
cost
of
the
installation,
operation
or
removal
of
such
facilities.
"
"and
(3),
that
the
cable
television
company
agree
to
indemnify
the
landlord
for
any
damage
caused
by
the
installation,
operation
or
removal
of
such
facilities.
"
and
then
(b):
"demand
or
accept
payment
from
any
tenant
in
any
form
in
exchange
for
permitting
cable
television
service
on
or
within
his
property
or
premises,
or
from
any
cable
television
in
exchange
therefore
in
excess
of
any
amount
which
the
commission
shall
by
regulation
determine
to
be
reasonable.
"
now,
i
won't
read
the
rest,
though
it
is
relevant.
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
statute
which
set
up
a
cable
television
commission
which
has
authority
to
make
awards.
it
has
made
a
general
regulation
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
damage,
that
there
is
no
loss
to
a
landlord
in
the
ordinary
case,
and
that
the
ordinary
landlord
is
entitled
to
simply
a
nominal
payment,
which
is
one
time,
one
dollar.
mr.
michael
s.
gruen
if
i
may
for
a
few
minutes.
first
let
me
take
up
a
couple
of
areas
where
mr.
griswold
and
we
agree.
one
is
that
i
also
would
like
to
argue
the
telephone
case,
but
on
the
other
side.
the
second
is
more
germane
to
this
case.
mr.
griswold
has
proposed
that
if
trunk
lines
were
installed
under
the
auspices
of
section
828
that
would
probably
be
unconstitutional,
but
that
he
distinguishes
between
trunk
lines
and
feeder
lines.
we
of
course
agree
that
such
installation
of
trunk
lines
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
i
think
we
differ
on
the
facts.
let
me
demonstrate
to
you,
if
you
will
take
a
look
at
joint
appendix
page
166,
just
what
a
crossover
is,
what
a
block
circuit
installation
is.
this
diagram
on
page
166
illustrates
a
typical
new
york
city
block
and
a
typical
installation
by
teleprompter.
in
the
upper
left-hand
corner
of
the
diagram,
the
cable
enters
at
number
118
riverside
drive.
it
then
continues
about
halfway
around
the
block
on
west
84th
street
and
it
goes
down
along
riverside
drive
from
118
to
110
riverside
drive,
and
then
along
the
lower
rung
of
buildings
on
west
83rd
street,
occasionally
crossing
back
to
the
buildings
on
84th
street
to
provide
service
there.
what
this
diagram
shows
is
a
trunk
line,
in
my
opinion,
what
i
would
call
a
trunk
line.
this
diagram
shows
that
the
typical
installation
is
the
use
of
rooftops
of
buildings
in
new
york
as
if
they
were
a
public
highway.
there
is
an
easement
there,
by
all
traditional
definitions
of
what
an
easement
is,
to
provide
service
to
buildings
by
dropping
feeder
lines
from
that
trunks
line
along
the
roof
to
individual
apartments
and
buildings.
there
has
been
discussion
about
the
attorney
general
providing
in
new
york
that
a
tenant
is
entitled
to
receive
telephone
service
if
he
wants,
the
telephone
company
may
be
required
to
condemn
it.
we
of
course
don't
deny
for
a
minute
that
the
legislature
in
new
york
may
require
the
provision
of
cable
television
service.
what
we
say
is
that,
just
like
in
the
case
of
telephone
service,
it
requires
condemnation
or
compensation
in
the
form
of
rental
payments
for
the
use
of
our
property.
mr.
griswold
suggested
that
the
labor
cases,
such
as
babcock
&
wilcox,
allow
absolutely
free
entry
by
organizers
onto
private
property.
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
slightly
inaccurate.
what
these
cases
provide...
particularly
i
refer
you
to
central
hardware
and
babcock
&
wilcox...
is
that
where
the
owner
of
the
property
has
situated
it
in
such
a
way
that
it's
inaccessible...
his
employees
are
inaccessible
by
any
means
other
than
a
temporary
entry
by
union
organizers
for
the
limited
duration
of
an
organizational
campaign,
then
he
has
taken
steps
which
modify
his
property
right
to
the
extent
that
he
is
in
effect
creating
a
nuisance
his
injuring
outsiders
by
not
permitting
their
entry
for
very
limited
purposes
onto
his
property.
i
would
submit
that
this
is
not
the
case
here.
there
is
no
necessity.
communications
can
proceed
quite
freely
to
tenants
absent
cable
television,
by
mail,
telephone,
any
other
method.
thank
you
very
much.
