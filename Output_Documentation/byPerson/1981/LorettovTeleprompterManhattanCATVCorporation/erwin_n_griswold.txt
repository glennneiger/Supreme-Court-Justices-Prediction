mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
a
question
of
new
york
law.
on
it
i
would
rely
on
the
opinion
filed
in
this
case
by
the
attorney
general
of
new
york,
in
which
he
says
that
if
a
tenant
wants
telephone
service
that
he
can
apply
to
the
public
service
commission
of
new
york,
which
would
direct
the
telephone
company
to
condemn
an
easement
to
provide
the
television
service
to
that
building.
i
think
that
as
i
understand
the
law
of
new
york,
the
landlord
could
not
prevent
the
installation
of
telephone
service.
but
under
the
statutory
law
of
new
york,
which
goes
back
90
years,
that
right
to
enter
the
premises
would
be
obtained
by
condemning
an
easement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
compensated
one.
i--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--i
like
to
suggest
that
this
is
really
a
kind
of
an
academic
question,
quite
apart
from
that
lovely
apartment
building
that
the
chief
justice
would
like
to
live
in.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
there
simply
aren't
any
cases
on
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
no
landlord
would
dream
of
telling
a
tenant
that
you
can't
have
a
telephone
in
your
place.
it's
simply
taken
for
granted.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
terms
of
this
statute,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
our
red
brief.
section
828:
"no
landlord"--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--it's
page
2a
in
the
appendix
of
the
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
doesn't
assume
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
suggests
an
answer,
made
by
the
state.
and
that
i
think
gets
to
the
heart
of
the
case,
because
here
the
appellant's
case
depends
upon
the
assertion
that
mrs.
loretto's
property
has
been
taken.
but
that
begs
the
question.
the
issue
here
is
what
is
the
extent
of
the
landlord's
property
after
a
lease
has
been
made.
this
is
property
which,
when
mrs.
loretto
owns
it
alone
and
keeps
it
vacant,
is
undoubtedly
hers,
and
section
828
has
no
application
to
it.
but
when
she
chooses
to
devote
the
property
to
rental
purposes,
that
connotes
a
divided
ownership
of
the
property.
she
no
longer
is
the
sole
owner
of
that
property,
and
the
tenant
has
rights
not
only
with
respect
to,
shall
i
say,
the
six
walls
of
the
apartment,
but
also
has
a
great
many
other
rights
with
respect
to
the
usage
of
that
building.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it
gives
it
to
the
tenant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
does
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
tenant's
use
of
any
rights
which
he
may
have
in
the
overall
premises.
it
does
facilitate
his
use,
if
he
chooses,
to
have
cable
television.
but
let's
suppose,
for
example,
that
a
landlord
makes
a
lease
and
when
the
tenant
arrives
with
the
moving
van
the
landlord
stands
at
the
door
and
says:
stop,
there's
nothing
in
the
lease
about
bringing
in
furniture.
or
suppose
the
landlord
says,
there's
nothing
in
the
lease
about
bringing
in
food;
that
will
attract
mice
and
that
will
lead
to
vermin,
and
i
must
insist
as
a
health
measure
that
you
not
bring
in
food.
of
course
the
landlord
would
not
be
sustained,
even
though
there
was
no
provision
in
the
lease
about
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
would
be
entirely
different.
and
the
lease
in
this
case
couldn't
do
that
because
the
new
york
legislature
has--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--and
new
york
has
changed
the
law
with
respect
to
the
respective
rights
of
landlord
and
tenant,
and
our
position
would
be
that
that
is
a
standard
part
of
the
powers
of
a
state
legislature,
to
regulate
the
rights
of
landlord
and
tenant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
case
the
landlord
is
subjected
to
no
costs.
the
costs
are
entirely
paid
by
the
television
company
or
by
the
tenant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
gets
to...
that
gets
to
the
question
of
crossovers,
which
of
course
is
very
important.
i
would
like
to
suggest,
before
i
get
to
crossovers,
which
is
an
essential
issue
in
the
case
here,
suppose
this
was
a
single
family
house
to
begin
with,
on
a
plot
of
land,
and
it
was
leased.
a
tenant
obtained
it
and
the
tenant,
having
a
three-year
lease,
says,
i
want
cable
television.
it
seems
to
me
extremely
unlikely
that
any
court
would
hold
that
the
tenant,
having
the
rights
which
a
tenant
of
a
three-year
lease
of
a
single
family
house,
did
not
have
enough
property
rights
to
entitle
him
to
bring
in
cable
television.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
depends
on
how
you
define
"fixtures".
i
suppose
that
building
an
addition--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--it's
certainly
removable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
fixtures
usually
are
not
removable.
that's
part
of
the
definition.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
in
due
course
i
will
come
to
a
few
rights
that
the
tenant
does
have.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
particular
statute
is
24
supportable
in
our
view
not
merely
by
the
power
of
new
york
to
regulate
the
respective
interests
of
landlord
and
tenant
in
rental
property,
but
also
by
the
clearly
supported,
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
the
findings
of
the
statute,
interest
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
fostering
and
developing
improved
communications
and
educational
facilities.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
would
be,
mr.
justice,
and
i
would
suggest
that
for
all
practical
purposes
that
is
the
law
of
new
york
today.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
under
the
statutory
law
of
new
york,
which
went
back
to
very
early
days
and
much
more
conventional
notions
of
taking
than
have
been
developed
in
this
court,
let's
say
in
the
last
ten
years...
pruneyard
and
a
good
many
labor
cases--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--well,
certainly.
i
think
it's
penn
central.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
one
of
the
cases
to
which
we
will
refer.
i
wouldn't
doubt
myself
that
if
new
york
were
now
to
repeal
that
telephone
statute,
which
requires...
is
interpreted
to
require
the
taking
and
paying,
and
to
substitute
a
statute
like
828,
i'd
rather
like
to
argue
that
case
here.
i
kind
of
think
maybe
it
could
be
won.
at
least
that's
the--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
you
will
find...
you
will
find
that
it
is
very
hard
to
find
that
any
telephone
company
has
paid
for
that
right
for
a
long,
long
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
mean
it.
i
mean
the
right
to
bring
in
a
feeder
line
to
lead
telephone
service
into
a
residence
or
into
a
business
building.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
what
i
call
trunk
lines
and
feeder
lines,
and
there
are
old
cases
of
this
court,
100
years
ago,
involving
telephone...
telegraph
companies
putting
their
lines
down
city
streets
and
down
railroad
rights
of
way,
and
it
was
held
that
they
had
to
pay
for
that
right.
and
i
would
suspect
that
if
new
york
passed
a
statute
saying
that
any
cable
television
company
is
entitled
to
put
its
trunk
lines
on
private
property
without
paying,
that
that
would
not
be
held
to
be
constitutional.
i
think
it
is
different
with
respect
to
feeder
lines,
and
that
perhaps
is
an
appropriate
place
for
me
to
come
to
the
crossover
problem.
there
are
two
kinds
of
crossovers,
as
i
see
it.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
there
were
three,
but
i
think
that
two
of
those
present
the
same
legal
issue.
one
is
what
i
call
the
short
crossover,
and
that
is
that
when
the
cable
comes
in
on
the
roof
to
this
building,
having
come
from
the
adjacent
building
on
this
side
and
serving
a
tenant
in
this
building,
then
the
cable
continues,
and
the
record
shows
in
this
case
four
to
six
feet,
in
order
to
bring
service
to
the
next
building.
and
we
suggest,
first,
that
that's
de
minimis;
and
second,
that
there
is
a
clear
quid
pro
quo
in
it,
because
this
building's
tenants
get
the
service
because
there's
a
crossover
from
the
next
building,
and
to
say
that
in
order
to
do
that
you
have
to
provide
the
same
kind
of
a
lead
to
the
adjoining
building
on
the
other
side
doesn't
seem
very
serious.
but
in
any
event,
we
would
contend
that
that
is
not
a
taking
requiring
a
payment
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth.
now,
the
other
one
is
what
i
call
the
pure
crossover,
and
that
is
the
situation
where
there
is
no
tenant
in
this
building
who
has
cable
television,
but
the
cable
television
company
wants
to
bring
the
cable
from
the
building
on
the
right
across
this
building
in
order
to
get
to
the
building
on
the
left.
and
i
would
say
that
even
that,
even
as
applied
to
that,
the
statute
is
valid,
just
as
the
new
york
statute
now
provides
that
a
person
who
builds
a
new
apartment
house
must
provide
it
with
water
and
sewer
service.
there
are
no
tenants
in
the
building
when
he
is
building
it.
there
may
be
no
tenants
for
six
months
after
he
has
completed
it
if
his
rents
are
so
high
that
he
can't
get
people
in.
nevertheless,
he
won't
get
a
building
permit
to
start
with
unless
he
provides
water
and
sewer
service.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think,
mr.
justice,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
new
york
should
change
its
statute
and
say
that
a
person
building
a
new
multiple
dwelling
apartment
house
must
provide
telephone
lines
in
the
building
when
it's
built,
that
such
a
statute
would
be
clearly
constitutional.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
laundromats
and
room
for
vending
machines
become
more
difficult,
but--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--well,
perhaps
this
is
the
time
for
me
to
come
to
another
part
of
my
argument.
the
contention
is
made
by
mrs.
loretto's
counsel
that
several
of
the
cases
that
i
would
bring
before
you,
including
a
whole
series
of
labor
cases
which
have
completely
denied
the
right
of
the
owner
of
property
to
exclude
people...
the
owner
of
property
under
this
court's
decision
has
to
admit
union
representatives
under
certain
circumstances--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--those
are
affirming
orders
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
they
have
the
general
statute--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--babcock,
that's
right.
--of
fair
dealing
behind
it,
but
no
specific--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--they
do
reject
the
constitutional
objection,
and
do
it...
and
do
it
on
a--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--well,
pruneyard
is
another
one
of
them.
but
the
republic
aviation
case,
one
of
the
early
ones,
quotes
judge
augustus
hand,
who
was
dealing
with
a
ship
and
union
organizers
wanted
to
go
on
board
the
ship,
which
was
really
the
only
place
that
they
could
get
to
the
employees,
because
otherwise
the
ship's
on
the
high
seas.
and
justice
augustus
hand
said,
it
is
not
every
interference
with
property
rights
which
is
within
the
fifth
amendment.
and
this
court
has
followed
that
in
the
labor
cases.
we
think
that
the
pruneyard
case
is
another
clear
example
of
that.
california
said,
through
its
supreme
court,
applying
its
constitution,
that
the
owner
of
a
shopping
center
was
required
to
allow
the
admission
of
people
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
signatures
and
distributing
literature.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
a
taking
requiring
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
but--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--well,
justice
o'connor,
that's
just
the
point
i
am
coming
to.
our
friends
say
that
this
is
a
permanent
occupation.
i
would
suggest
in
the
first
place
that
it
is
not
a
permanent
occupation.
it's
an
occupation
only
as
long
as
the
landlord
chooses
to
use
this
for
rental
purposes.
the
landlord
can
occupy
the
building
himself
and
section
828
no
longer
has
any
application.
in
other
words,
it
is
what
we
call
a
use-dependent
regulation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
the
employer--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--no,
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
go
out
of
the
rental
business,
yes,
but
not
necessarily
go
out
of
business.
i
have
put
together
a
list
of
17
instances
where
there
are
permanent
occupations
of
a
landlord's
premises.
sprinklers
has
already
been
referred
to,
and
this
court
in
the
queenside
hills
realty
company
case
upheld
the
validity
of
that
statutory
provisions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
suggestion
is
also
made
by
our
opponents.
would
this
statute
be
better
if
it
said
that
the
landlord
must
put
in
cable
television
and
he
owns
it
and
he
pays
for
it?
it
seems
to
me
that
here
the
landlord
is
better
off,
less
burdened
by
a
statute
which
says--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--well,
that's
also--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--the
facilitation
of
communication
and
education
seems
to
me
to
come
within
the
police
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
that's
only
because
the
city
has
franchised
one
company.
that's
not
the
result
of
the
tenant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
suppose
they'd
get
their
five
percent
from
whatever
cable
operators
they
franchise.
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
in
addition
to
fire
escapes
and
sprinklers...
in
addition
to
sprinklers,
there
are
fire
escapes
and
smoke
detectors,
and
those
have
a
safety
element
in
it.
but
let
me
point
out
several
things.
the
causby
case
has
been
referred
to.
we
usually
think
of
that
as
the
case
which
said
that
when
there
are
low-flying
planes
that
means
that
is
a
taking.
but
the
causby
case
is
the
case
which,
by
way
of
dictum,
but
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
dictums
that
was
ever
uttered
by
this
court,
said
that
the
statutes
of
congress
which
provide
that
the
upper
air
space
is
a
public
highway
and
can
be
used
freely
without
compensation,
thereby
changing
the
clear
common
law,
which
said
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
to
the
highest
heavens,
the
court
in
the
causby
case
said
that
property
can
be
taken
without
compensation.
now,
similarly
in
block
and
hirsch,
which
is
the
early
rent
control
case.
the
statute
in
that
case
provides
the
tenant
can
continue
to
occupy
the
property
after
the
end
of
the
lease
if
he
continues
to
pay
the
same
rent,
and
that
is
surely
a
permanent
occupation.
and
one
that
rather
appeals
to
me
is
mailboxes.
we
have
cited
section
57
of
the
new
york
multiple
dwelling
act.
mr.
gruen
in
his
brief
says,
well,
there
isn't
any
requirement
that
there
be
mailboxes.
what
the
situation
is
is
that
the
post
office
department,
through
regulations...
and
this
is...
this
is
155.6,
says
that:
"delivery
of
mail
shall
be
contingent
upon
the
installation
and
maintenance
of
mail
receptacles
approved
by
the
postal
service.
"
which
would
mean
that
if
you
don't
have
the
receptacles
you
don't
get
mail.
but
new
york
has
provided
by
section
57
that
you
must
provide
for
receptacles.
and
let's
continue
with
the
post
office
regulations.
there
is
a
regulation
on
apartment

it
provides
on

that
mailboxes
must
be
6
inches

5
inches
by

inches.
now,
if
you
multiply
that
out,
it's
450
cubic
inches.
and
if
you
take
a
half-inch
cable
which
is
on

roof,
it
takes
194
feet
of
half-inch
cable
to
occupy
450
cubic
inches.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
has
to
pay
for
them,
yes.
and
mrs.
loretto
is
better
off.
she
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
the--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--this
is
permanent
occupation
of
a
part
of
mrs.
loretto's
property,
which
she
is
not
free
to
use
for
some
other
purpose.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
the
time
might
come
when
that
would
seem
to
be
reasonable.
as
of
now
it
seems
rather
far-fetched.
but
in
new
york
city
i
suggest
that
cable
television
has
become
as
near
a
necessity
as
a
telephone
and
electric
service,
as
to
which
there
really
isn't
any
question
because
they
are
always
provided.
and
what
new
york
was
trying
to
do
through
this
statute
was
to
facilitate
the
development
of
cable
service
as
a
means
of
improving
communication
and
education
in
the
city
of
new
york
or
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
within
the
generally
accepted
powers
of
state
legislatures.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
penn
central.
it's
easy
to
say,
well,
penn
central
is
just
regulation.
it's
not...
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
occupation.
but
the
fact
was
that
all
that
space
up
there,
which
was
reachable
by
the
penn
central
people
by
building
up
it,
was
taken
away
from
them.
it
isn't
that
it
is
occupied
by
someone
else;
it's
not
occupied
by
them,
which
is
a
complete
interference
with
their
rights
of
ownership.
it
is
true
that
they
received
a
sort
of
compensation
in
the
form
of
transferable
development
rights.
but
it
is
also
clear
that
the
court
did
not
have
any
conception...
or
didn't
decide
that
that
constituted
full
value
or
payment.
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
case
of
permanent
occupancy
of
the
penn
central
space
without
the
payment
of
just
compensation,
because
the
court
concluded
on
the
balance
of
all
the
factors
involved
this
was
the
kind
of
regulation
which
did
not
constitute
a
taking.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
i
could
cite
zoning
ordinances
as
another
instance.
indeed,
this
all
goes
back
to
mundt
against
illinois,
which
in
1877
decided
that
the
taking
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
prevent...
or
of
the
fourteenth
amendment...
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
regulating
substantially
to
the
extent
of
taking
away
a
large
share
of
the
profits
of
a
business.
now,
we
have
a
number
of
other
instances.
the
section
50(c)
of
the
new
york
multiple
dwelling
law
provides
that
the
landlord
must
allow
the
tenants
to
organize
and
provide
a
doorman
in
the
building.
the
doorman
occupies
some
of
the
landlord's
space,
for
which
he
receives
no
compensation.
there
is
an
interesting
passage
by
mr.
justice
brandeis--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--it's
only
the...
it's
only
the
tenants
who
do
this.
the
landlord
is
not
required
to
do
it.
it
has
to
do
with
security.
but
i
don't
think
these
things
are...
certainly
penn
central
had
nothing
to
do
with
security.
that
related
to
something
else.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
can
i
just
read
one
quotation
from
justice
brandeis?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
the
delaware,
lackawanna
&
western
railroad.
it
had
to
do
with
a
city
ordinance
providing
a
taxi
stand
on
railroad
land.
the
court
held
that
that
ordinance
was
invalid.
but
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
that
if
"the
town
should
pass
an
ordinance
establishing,
on
the
driveway,
a
taxi
stand
available
only
to
incoming
passengers,
i
see
no
reason
why,
under
the
contract
between
it
and
the
railroad
or
under
the
general
laws
of
new
jersey,
it
may
not
do
so.
"
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
the
sort
of
earmark
of
a
use-dependent
regulation,
that
this
regulation
here
depends
upon
the
use
of
the
property
for
rental
purposes,
and
that
it
should
be
sustained.
