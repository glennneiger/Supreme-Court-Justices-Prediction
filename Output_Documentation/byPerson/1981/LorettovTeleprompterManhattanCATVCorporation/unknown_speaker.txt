unknown
speaker
are
you
conceding
that?
unknown
speaker
in
that
statement
are
you
conceding
it's
a
subordinate
right?
[laughter]
it's
not
so
subordinate
that
you
can't
prevail,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
not
so
subordinate
that
you
can't
prevail.
unknown
speaker
argument
by
irony.
unknown
speaker
the
crossovers
aren't
even
subject
to
that,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
gruen.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
distinction
made
between
commercial
and
residential
property?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
no
commercial
property
issue
presented
by
the
record
in
this
case,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
class
perfected?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
are
they?
unknown
speaker
who
are
they?
i
think
the
question
is,
are
there
any
owners
of
commercial...
non-rental
commercial
property
included
in
that
class?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
how
about
just
a
warehouse
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
going
to
make
that
argument,
then
it
applies
to
private
residences.
literally,
they're
among
the
class,
just
as
well
as
commercial
property.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
suppose
an
owner
who
doesn't...
an
owner
of
a
single
family
residence
who
doesn't
want
the
service
nevertheless
has
to
put
up
with
the
wires
in
order
for
teleprompter
to
get
to
the
next
property?
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
whether
he
wants
the
service
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gruen,
can
this
ordinance
or
statute
be
regarded
as
a
form
of
regulation,
to
the
extent
that
it
affects
the
tenants,
as
opposed
to
the
crossover,
a
landlord-tenant
regulation?
and
there
are
many
such
regulations
extant
around
the
country
requiring
landlords
to
furnish
utilities
or
other
such
requirements.
unknown
speaker
permanently.
unknown
speaker
how
about
telephone
equipment?
unknown
speaker
it
continues
to
belong
to
the
telephone
company.
unknown
speaker
you
found
no
statutory
requirement
that
landlords
allow
tenants
to
be
served
by
telephone
service?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
you
think
that
section
828
would
be
defensible
if
it
contained
an
additional
provision
that
said
no
prescriptive
right
will
attach?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
think
it
would
be
different
if
the
law
said...
if
the
law
said:
in
one
paragraph,
all
apartment
buildings
will
be
equipped
with
sprinkler
systems
for
fire
prevention;
section
two,
all
apartment
buildings
shall
be
equipped
with
cables
or
equipment
so
that
television...
or
so
that
tenants
may
easily
plug
into
cable
television.
a
regulation
that
required
the
landlord
to
make
these
installations,
like
he
does
sprinklers
or
hot
water
heaters
or
something
else?
unknown
speaker
half
the
problem?
does
it
solve
it
all
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
taking
problem
then,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about,
say,
installing
a
sprinkler
system?
very
expensive.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
that
comes
under
the
police
power
as
a
matter
of
public
safety,
because
it
involves
not
only
the
safety
of
one
tenant,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
would
say
that
the
benefits
of
television
are
not
as
great
as
the
benefit
of
being
free
from
a
fire,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
solve
your
problem
if
the
law
said
in
section
two,
it
said,
you
will
install
these
teleprompter
or
these
cable
television
cables
whenever
some
cable
television
company
will
pay
you
for
it?
that
wouldn't,
cost
you
anything.
any
time
they
offer
to
pay
for
the
installation,
you'll
put
them
all
over.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
tenant.
the
tenant
has
the
right
to
pass
it
through
from
where
it's
connected
on
the
outside
of
the
building.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
landlord
has
from
the
edge
of
his
building
to
all
the
tenants'
apartments,
he
has
installed
a
cable,
for
which
he's
been
paid.
and
the
cable
company
comes
along
and
just
plugs
in
at
the
edge
of
his
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
they've
paid
him
for
the
expense.
unknown
speaker
the
cable
company
pays
him
the
expense.
unknown
speaker
he's
not
out
of
pocket.
but
you
say
there's
still
an
appropriation
of
his
property?
unknown
speaker
did
you
suggest,
mr.
gruen,
that...
are
there
new
york
statutes
which
require
landlords,
say
in
apartment
buildings,
to
install
sprinkler
systems,
smoke
detectors
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
they
say
as
to
compensation?
i
didn't
catch
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so
actually
the
cost
is
paid
by
the
tenant,
not
by
the
landlord?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
paid
by
the
landlord
here,
either.
the
cost
of
installation
isn't
paid
by
the
landlord.
it's
going
to
be
paid
by
the
cable
company.
unknown
speaker
so
he
doesn't
have
to
charge
the
tenant
for
the
cost.
unknown
speaker
but
he's
not
paid
by
the
tenant
for
the
fact
that
the
sprinklers
occupy
a
piece
of
his
property.
well,
the
sprinklers
becomes
his
property,
i
suppose,
become
the
landlord's
property.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gruen,
aren't
you...
you're
arguing
mainly
a
question
of
compensation.
i
thought
your
basic
position
in
the
brief
was
that
there's
a
basic
distinction
between
a
physical
invasion
by
a
third
party
and
a
regulation
which
requires
the
owner
of
the
property
to
do
something
to
his
own
property,
and
then
you
have
a
question
of
whether
that
amounts
to
a
taking.
and
aren't
all
these
examples
that
have
been
given
to
you
simply
forms
of
regulation?
they
don't
even
approach
the
basic
argument
that
you've
made,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
they
are
reasonable
regulations
of
an
owner's
use
of
his
property.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
arguable
they
might
not
even
require
compensation
if
you
look
at
them
as...
if
you
view
them
as
regulatory
rather
than
as
takings,
rather
than
as
physical
invasions.
unknown
speaker
none
of
them
involves
a
physical
invasion,
which
i
understand
to
be
your
principal
argument.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
phone
company's
invasion
in
new
york
apartments,
where
they
run
the
wire
right
straight
up
the
wall?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
do
it,
and
the
tenant
has
his
space
taken
and
the
landlord's
space,
too.
the
phone
company
uses
both
spaces
to
run
its
cables
through
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
landlord
could
build
an
apartment
building
and
simply
say
that
he
thinks
telephones
are
an
abomination
and
there'll
be
no
telephones
in
this
building
and
no
telephone
wires
in
the
building,
could
he
not?
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
trouble
getting
tenants.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
he
might
get
a
lot
of
tenants
that
way.
unknown
speaker
he
might
get
a
lot
of
tenants.
there
might
be
some
peculiar
people.
unknown
speaker
just
think
of
the
speech
interest.
mr.
gruen,
does
the
presence
of
the
cable
equipment
increase
the
rental
value
of
the
apartment?
unknown
speaker
i'm
no
fan
of
most
television,
but
how
many
channels
are
available
in
new
york
city
area
on
cable?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
other
factual
question.
you
started
out
by
pointing
out
that
before
the
ordinance
was
passed
your
opponent
used
a
form
which
gave
the
landlord
five
percent
of
whatever
revenues
were
derived
from
that
building.
unknown
speaker
as
to...
and
they're
five-year
term
license
agreements,
as
i
understand
it.
as
to
those
which
were
in
effect
and
had
three
or
four
years
to
run
when
the
ordinance
was
passed,
did
they
continue
to
have
payment
being
made
to
the
landlord
or
is
that
money
now
paid
to
the
city
pursuant
to
the
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
the
ordinance,
it
would
prohibit
the
continued
payment
pursuant
to
those
agreements.
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
they
the
same
five
percent
of
gross
revenues?
i
mean,
say--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--would
the
rationale
of
the
court
below
sustain
an
ordinance
which
told
all
landlords
that,
you
must
maintain
in
the
basement
a
room
in
which
vending
machine
companies
may
place
their
vending
machines,
or
laundromat
operators
may
place
their
laundromat,
for
the
convenience
of
tenants?
unknown
speaker
the
rationale
would
seem
to
reach
it.
unknown
speaker
or
you
must
make
a
space
on
your
roof
for
a
swimming
pool
company
to
put
in
a
swimming
pool?
unknown
speaker
he'd
be
compensated
for
it?
unknown
speaker
which
is
not
the
case
here.
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
that
just
assumes
the
answer
to
the
question,
that
it's
perfectly
all
right
to
take
a
piece
of
your
property
as
long
as
it
doesn't
lover
its
value.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
suggests
an
answer
to
the
question.
unknown
speaker
then
if
you
treat
this
as
a
right,
then
does
the
statute
not
take
something
away
from
the
tenants
without
compensation?
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
whether
you
regard
this
as
a
boon
or
otherwise,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
lease
said
that
you
can't
bring
in
furniture
or
food?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
there
was
a
lease
before
this
statute
was
passed
in
which
the
landlord
said,
you
may
not
have
cable
television
in
our
premises,
because
we
think
it's
a
nuisance?
that
was
a
term
of
the
lease.
the
landlord
said
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
doesn't
cover
the
crossovers,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
but
in
effect
this
landlord
is
required
not
only
to
provide
for
the
tenants
of
her
property,
but
to
provide
for
the
tenants
of
some
other
landlord
by
giving
a
crossover.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
i
think
it's
a
pretty
normal
provision
in
leases
not
to
permit
fixtures
without
the
consent
of
the
landlord.
it's
a
perfectly
straightforward
provision
in
every
lease.
unknown
speaker
i
would
hesitate
to
think
this
wasn't
a
fixture.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
way
these
are
described,
they're
pretty
well
plugged
into
the
building.
well,
we
ought
to
be
careful,
taking
about
new
york
city
apartment
leases.
because
of
the
30
or
40
provisions
in
the
lease,
the
tenant
only
has
one
protection,
one
provision
to
protect
the
tenant.
that
gives
him
the
right
to
pay.
and
all
the
others...
for
example,
one
provision
is
if
the
landlord
decides
that
the
tenant
is
not
a
decent
person
he
can
throw
him
out.
and
another
provision,
i
hereby
give
up
my
right
to
a
jury
trial.
i
don't
think
those
are
common
all
over,
but
they
are
legal
in
new
york
and
are
approved
by
the
new
york
courts.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that
argument?
supposing
the
statute
changed
the
words
"cable
television"
to
the
word
"telephone".
everywhere
it
says
"cable"
it
said
"telephone",
and
otherwise
it
were
precisely
the
same,
there's
an
interest
in
communication
by
telephone.
would
that
be
lawful,
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
earlier
we
had
agreed
that
if
there
were
to
be
a
television
installation
it
would
be
a
taking
for
which
there'd
have
to
be
condemnation
and
a
payment?
unknown
speaker
new
york
central.
unknown
speaker
penn
central.
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
it'd
really
be
quite
a
departure
from
what
the
telephone
companies
in
50
states
have
been
doing
for
a
long,
long
time,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
paid
for
that
right,
mr.
griswold,
do
you
mean
the
right
to
have
an
easement
to
string
poles?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
new
york
amended
828
to
provide
that,
because
of
our
interest
in
communications,
in
the
event
that
there
isn't
any
telephone...
system
of
telephone
poles
in
this
particular
area...
let's
assume
the
poles
are
above
ground...
that
any
landlord
shall
allow
the
telephone
company
to
put
a
pole
in
his
back
yard,
without
having
to
pay
for
it?
unknown
speaker
you
necessarily
say
that
if
you
added
to
the
water
and
sewer
telephone
lines,
that
they
must
provide
telephone
lines
too
if
this
statute
includes
it?
unknown
speaker
and
laundromats
and
a
room
for
vending
machines?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why.
i
don't
know
why,
under
the
rationale
of
the
court
below,
a
requirement
that
a
landlord
set
aside
this
space
and
let
vending
machine
people
come
in
wouldn't
be
sustainable.
unknown
speaker
were
those
cases
statute
or
constitutional
arguments?
unknown
speaker
that's
babcock.
unknown
speaker
but
rejecting
constitutional
objections.
unknown
speaker
pruneyard
basis.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
qualitative
difference,
however,
between
a
temporary
use
of
property
and
a
permanent
occupation
of
a
portion
of
the
space?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that's
a
little
like
the
argument
that
the
employer
in
the
labor
cases
could
go
out
of
business
if
he
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
in
the
labor
cases,
could
just
go
out
of
business,
and
then
he
wouldn't
be
subjected
to
this
invasion
of
his
property
any
more.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
you're
saying
here.
the
landlords
could
always
go
out
of
the
rental
business.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
that
sprinklers
is
right
on
point,
though,
because
the
landlord
owns
the
sprinkler.
unknown
speaker
but
the
sprinkler
is
a
matter
of
public
safety,
not
only
for
the
landlord
but
for
all
his
tenants.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
safety
factor,
the
police
power
factor,
in
television?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
then
the
landlord
can
buy
any
sprinkler
system
he
wants
to,
too.
but
here
you're
telling
him
what
one
he's
going
to
get.
he
doesn't
have
a
choice
of
cable
tv
operators,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
you're
attacking
an
ordinance.
you're
attacking
a
law.
the
city
wants
to
protect
its
five
percent,
so
it
says,
please,
landlord,
you're
not
going
to
get
a
choice
of
cable
operator.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
the
city
doesn't
need
to
franchise
some
of
them,
because
they
don't
ask
for
it,
as
this
amicus
brief
makes
clear.
unknown
speaker
well,
again
you're...
there
it's
like
the
sprinklers.
they're
the
landlord's
boxes.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
nevertheless,
they're
a
third
party
coming
in
and
taking
a
piece
of
your
property
or
occupying
a
piece
of
your
property.
unknown
speaker
what
if
new
york
added
telex
to
the
catv
as
a
means
of
communication?
unknown
speaker
is
that
any
more
permanent
occupancy
than
any
zoning
ordinance
that
says
you
can
only
use
a
portion
of
your
property?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
security
measure
too,
i
take
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
