mr.
edmund
k.
trent
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
brought
by
the
appellants
there,
defendants
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
pleading
in
suit
was
the
second
count
of
the
complaint
by
the
plaintiff,
the
compagnie
des
bauxite
de
guinee,
a
non-pennsylvania
corporation,
against
a
number
of
defendants,
including
the
14
cross-petitioners,
non-pennsylvania
insurance
companies...
indeed,
they
were
non-american
insurance
companies...
on
contracts
of
insurance
made
in
london
insuring
a
risk
in
africa.
the
defendants
pleaded
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction
and
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
want
of
personal
jurisdiction.
the
plaintiff
requested
the
defendants
to
produce
their
insurance
policies
covering
pennsylvania
insureds,
pennsylvania
risks,
and
emanating
from
brokers
in
pennsylvania.
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
judge
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
on
the
defendants'
objections
to
the
request
for
documents,
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
insurers,
two
young
people
from
new
york
at
the
time,
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
defendants
did
not
have
copies
of
their
policies
in
their
possession.
the
contracts
of
insurance
consisted
of
for
the
most
part
each
contract
a
single
piece
of
paper
called
a
placing
slip,
where
the
terms
of
the
risk
were
summarized
in
shorthand
form,
abbreviated
form,
in
accordance
with
the
practice
in
london.
and
so
then
the
district
court
said,
well...
oh...
the
defendants'
counsel
said:
these
are
in
the
hands
of
about
150
brokers
in
london.
according
to
british
practice,
the
broker
is
not
the
agent
of
the
insurance
company,
but
the
agent
of
the
insured
or
the
prospective
insured
seeking
insurance.
and
so
the
district
judge
said,
request
them
from
the
brokers.
new
york
counsel
for
the
insurers
went
to
england
to
see
what
he
could
find
out
about
these
things.
in
effect,
he
undertook
to
do
what
the
court
had
ordered
him
to
do.
and
he
found
there
that
there
were
about
four
million
files
involved
in
these
policies,
because
the
insurers
did
not
have
indexes
relating
to
pennsylvania.
their
indexes
were
based
on
large
geographical
areas.
the
continent
of
north
america
was
the
smallest
group
that
they
had.
and
so
he
came
back
and,
within
the
time
allowed
by
the
court
as
extended
for
30
days,
he
filed
an
affidavit
offering
to
produce
all
the
defendants'
own
records,
these
placing
slips,
at
their
places
where
they
were
kept
in
england,
mostly
in
london,
and
for
one
of
the
defendants
in
tel
aviv,
where
its
records
were
kept.
at
the
hearing...
oh,
the
plaintiff
then
filed
a
motion
to
compel,
and
at
the
hearing
on
that
motion
the
district
judge
said,
i'll
give
you
another
60
days
to
get
these
policies
from
the
brokers.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
not
expressly,
no.
but
the
request
for
documents
asked
for
them
to
be
brought
to
the
office
of
plaintiff's
counsel
in
pittsburgh,
and
it
was
assumed
that
that's
where
they
were
to
be
produced.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
i
think
everyone
agrees
on
that.
there
was
no
specific
statement
by
the
court
that
they
should
be
produced
in
pittsburgh,
but
everyone
assumed
it
because
the
request
for
documents
said
to
produce
them
at
the
office
of
plaintiff's
counsel
in
pittsburgh.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
to
produce
in
pittsburgh,
you
mean?
well,
it
would
be
possible,
yes,
to
bring
4,000,
four
million
files
to
pittsburgh.
but
as
a
practical
matter
i
would
say
no.
i
question
even
whether
hercules
could
do
such
a
thing,
and
we
have
no
one
of
his
caliber
on
our
staff.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
impossible.
when--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--yes.
it
was
not--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--well,
i
can't
say
that
it
was
expressly
said,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it's
just
obvious
that
you
can't
bring
four
million
files
across
the
ocean
as
a
practical
matter.
and
that
was
the
position
that
we
took.
now,
then
the
district
court
gave
the
defendants
another
60
days
to
get
the
policies
from
the
brokers
in
london.
the
defendants
then
sent
letters
to
roughly
150
brokers,
and
the
brokers
answered
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
get
these
policies
out
of
their
files
or
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
it
within
the
time
limit,
which
was
a
little
less
than
60
days
by
the
time
they
got
the
request.
so
that
there
they
were
taking
the
definite
position
that
it
was
impossible
because
their
files
too
were
not
indexed
according
to
the
states
in
the
united
states.
after
that
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
motion
for
sanctions
to
have
the
court
find
that
the
defendants
were
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
pennsylvania.
while
that
motion
was
pending,
the
defendants,
based
on
some
newly
discovered
evidence
which
they
had
received
a
few
months
before,
filed
an
action
in
london
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
they
had
the
right
to
avoid,
as
the
british
term
is,
to
rescind
the
contract,
because
of
the
failure
of
the
plaintiff
to
disclose
material
information
at
the
time
they
asked
the
defendants
to
assume
the
risk.
the
plaintiff
then
filed
a
motion
to
enjoin
that
london
action,
and
at
the
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
the
district
court
entered
a
sanction,
finding
the
defendants
subject
to
jurisdiction
and
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
enjoining
the
action
in
london.
about
two
months
later,
on
the
plaintiff's
motion
he
entered
orders
saying
that
the
jurisdictional
finding
is
conclusive,
there
shall
be
no
discovery
on
jurisdiction
and
no
testimony
on
it
at
the
permanent
injunction
hearing.
then
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
third
circuit,
in
an
opinion
by
judge
aldisert,
reversed
the
injunction,
but
affirmed
on
the
jurisdiction.
plaintiffs
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
on
the
injunction,
which
is
still
pending,
and
the
defendants
filed
a
cross-petition
on
the
jurisdiction,
which
your
honors
granted.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
where
they
should
be
sued?
in
london.
the
custom
over
there
is
that
if--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--yes,
because
the
way
that
the
insurance
is
placed,
it's
the
broker
in
london
who
makes
the
contract
with
the
insurer
there.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
no,
unless
it's
stated
on
the
placing
slip,
it's
assumed
that
it
will
be
in
london.
now,
in
the
present
case
the
insurers,
the
underwriters
who
accepted
the
contract
for
the
insurers
thought
that
this
was
a
guinean
company
in
africa.
they
had
no
knowledge
at
all
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
delaware
corporation.
its
name
being
in
french
and
french
being
the
language
in
the
republic
of
guinea,
they
thought
it
was
a
guinean
risk.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
was
they
thought
they
were
reinsuring
a
guinean
company,
because
many
of
the
countries
there
have
preference
for
their
own
insurance
companies
and
the
london
companies
then
reinsure
them.
the
court
of
appeals
in...
well,
i
should
say
that
the
question
is
then
whether
the
sanction
was
proper.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it...
no.
and
we
say
that
depends
on
two
things,
whether
a
court
can
make
a
sanction,
make
an
order
requiring
discovery
and
impose
a
sanction
for
not
obeying
before
the
court
has
found
the
defendants
subject
to
personal
jurisdiction;
and
second,
that
the
order
in
this
case,
the
sanction
order,
is
valid
only
if
the
discovery
order
is
valid,
and
a
discovery
order
requiring
us
to
bring
four
million
files
from
london
to
pittsburgh
is
a
complete
abuse
of
discretion,
it's
impossible.
the
defendants
could
not
comply
with
it
and
therefore
they
didn't
willfully
disobey
it.
it
was
just
impossible
to
obey.
and
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
young
new
york
lawyers
who
were
handling
the
matter
were
contumacious
in
any
way.
they
were
trying
to
do
what
the
court
wanted
them
to
do,
and
when
they--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--well,
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
i
was
in
effect
excusing
them
because
of
their
lack
of
experience.
they
are
very
nice
people.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
for
not
immediately
saying,
we
will
produce
these
things
in
london.
they
first...
they
tried
to
get--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--oh,
absolutely.
they
were
in
charge
of
the
case.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
that's
right,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--the
order
was
to
produce
the
pennsylvania
policies,
but
in
order
to
do
that
the
brokers
in
london
and
the
defendants
in
london
would
have
had
to
go
through
four
million
files
to
see
which
ones
related
to
pennsylvania.
now,
in
the
course
of
one
of
the
hearings,
arguments
in
court,
the
lawyer
from
new
york
said:
well,
suppose
we
admit
that
we're
doing
one
percent,
we
get
one
percent
of
our
income
from
pennsylvania.
will
that
satisfy?
and
mr.
mellott
for
the
plaintiffs
said:
no,
i
will
not
take
your
word
for
that.
i
want
to
see
all
the
records
to
make
sure
that
you're
showing
them
all
to
us.
so
we
would
have
had
to
bring
four
million
files
over,
even
if
we
had
been
able
to
sort
out
just
the
pennsylvania
ones,
because
mr.
mellott
was
not
willing
to
accept
the
representation--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--no,
the
court's
order
was
just
the
pennsylvania
files,
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
oh,
they're
there.
they're
all
available.
it
would
be
just
a
matter
for
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
to
go
and
look
at
them
and
see.
he
would
have
to
dig
it
out,
and
the
cases
say
that
the
party
seeking
discovery
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
whatever
work
it
is
to
find
what
he
wants.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
if
you
do
not
excuse
them?
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
cannot
excuse
them--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--well,
i
don't
think
that
would.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
no,
i
wouldn't
think
i
would
lose
on
that.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
was
trying
to
in
effect
explain
what
took
place.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
right,
right,
exactly,
your
honor.
that's
true
and
that's
correct,
and
i
don't
think
the
other
side
contends
that
there
was.
their
principal
basis
is
that
we
just
did
not
produce
the
records
in
pittsburgh.
now,
on
the
court
of
appeals
judge
aldisert...
there's
a
split
of
authority
in
the
circuits.
the
latest
case
before
this
one
was
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
familia
de
boom
v.
arosa
mercantil
in
the
southern
district
of
texas,
where
the
district
court
had
dismissed
an
action
because
the
plaintiff
did
not
comply
with...
answer
interrogatories.
and
the
fifth
circuit,
reversed
that
and
said
you
cannot
make
an
order
requiring
them
to
answer
interrogatories
until
your
first
have
jurisdiction
over
them.
the
second
ground
for
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
here
was
that...
judge
aldisert
admitted
that
the
general
rule
is
that
where
the
documents
are
voluminous
the
party
seeking...
wanting
to
look
at
them
must
go
where
they
are.
but
he
said
that's
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
and
we
cannot
find
that...
we
can't
say
we
disagree
with
it.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
completely
wrong,
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
require
us
to
bring
four
million
files
over
to
america,
and
we've
cited
cases
in
the
brief
that
support
that.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes,
but
that
would
have
been
a
herculean
task,
because
they
had
no
indexes.
they
would
have
had
to
examine--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--yes,
that's
right.
and
because
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
the
information,
the
plaintiff
must
bear
the
burden
of
that.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
well,
two
of
them
by...
or
some
of
them,
by
taking
files
for
a
limited
period,
part
of
the
period...
the
period
they
asked
for
was
about
six
years.
they
took
part
of
a
year
or
a
year
or
something,
and
then
they
made
estimates,
and
they
all
said,
well,
we
don't
do
more
than
one
percent.
that
was--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--well,
i
think
that
was
just
the
general
feeling
of
the
underwriters.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
oh,
i
think
they
could
have
remembered
some
particular
ones,
but
that
wouldn't
satisfy
the
plaintiff.
and
by
taking--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--yes.
well,
that
was
where
they
got
their
one
percent,
by
looking
at
a
short
period.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
but
there
was
never
any
proposal
by
the
plaintiffs
to
accept
something
like
that.
they
wanted
the
whole
thing
and
they
wanted
to
look
at
every
paper
in
the
file
to
make
sure
we
weren't
withholding
some.
so
as
i
see
it,
the
way
these
things
ought
to
be
handled
is
if
there's
no
jurisdiction...
until
jurisdiction
is
found,
there's
no
power
in
the
court
to
enter
any
sort
of
order
against
a
defendant.
but
the
plaintiff
is
not
without
a
remedy
there.
that
was
one
of
the
things
judge
aldisert
said,
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
this,
otherwise
how
can
the
plaintiff
prove
his
case
of
jurisdiction.
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
initiate
discovery
against
us
as
non-parties.
the
british
statute
permits
that.
we
would
have
had
to
produce
our
documents
pursuant
to
subpoena
in
london,
and
then
they
could
have
looked
at
them.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
we
weren't
going
to
insist
on
that.
we
said,
sure,
come
over,
we'll
let
you
see
them.
and
if
they
then
wanted
to
look
at
the
brokers'
records
also,
they
could
have
subpoenaed
them.
but
i
think
the
brokers
would
have
let
them
come
and
look
at
them.
they...
except
for,
one
of
the
brokers
said
these
things
are
confidential.
the
others
did
not
object
to
producing
them
as
such.
they
objected
because
it
was
just
such
a
terrible
job
to
do.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes,
yes.
well,
we
had
the
right
to
do
that.
i
can't
say
that
i
would
have
objected
if
they
wanted
to
take
one.
now,
i
have
said
in
one
part
of
my
argument
that
these
files
in
the...
policies
on
the
brokers'
possession
were
not
subject
to
our
control.
as
a
practical
matter
they
were
not,
because
the
brokers
would
not
produce
them,
although
i
think
we
had
a
legal
right
to
get
them
from
the
broker.
after
all,
when
the
insurance
company
writes
insurance
and
signs
a
policy
and
the
broker
keeps
it,
the
insurance
company
has
a
right
to
get
that.
but
the
general
rule
in
the
law
is
that
if
a
party
which
has
control
of
another's
documents,
a
non-party
to
the
action
has
control
of
the
documents
of
a
party
and
the
party
says,
please
give
them
to
me,
and
the
person
with
custody
says,
no,
i
won't,
then
it's
up
to
the
other
party
to
the
case
who
wants
them
to
go
after
that
party
who
has
the
custody.
and
i
cited
some
cases
on
that.
because
they
wouldn't
produce
them
for
us.
so...
i
started
to
say
that
the
best
way
to
resolve
this
would
be
if
there
is
a...
jurisdiction
is
contested
and
then
the
party
asserting
jurisdiction
would
file
affidavits
and
the
other
one
would
file
affidavits.
and
if
they're
conflicting,
then
you
cannot...
you
could
dismiss
the
motion
to
dismiss.
you
could
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss,
but
you
couldn't
grant
it
on
conflicting
affidavits.
you
would
have
to
hold
a
hearing,
and
that
i
think
should
have
been
done.
judge
simmons
in
the
district
court
should
have
held
a
hearing
and
tried
to
resolve,
to
see
whether
there
would
be
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
jurisdiction,
and
then
he
could
order
discovery
to
get
more
evidence.
but
he
didn't
do
that.
at
the
same
time
as
he
made
his
injunction
order,
he
entered
a
sanction
and
we
had
no
opportunity,
then,
to
try
to
comply
with
the
sanction.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
one
thing
mr.
mellott
has
just
mentioned
now
and
he
mentioned
as
well
before
lunch,
he
said
that
we
had
asked
for
a
binding
determination
of
jurisdiction,
not
merely
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
he
is
incorrect
in
that.
on
page
38a
of
the
prayer
of
the
affidavit
which
was
filed
by
the
new
york
lawyers
under
their
new
york
practice,
where
they
make
an
affidavit
and
contain
the
motion
in
it--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes.
"wherefore,
it
is
respectfully
urged
that
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint
against
the
moving
defendants
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
and
forum
non
conveniens,
be,
in
all
respects,
granted.
"
so
all
he
was
doing
was
moving
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
he
did
not
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
by
saying
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
i
think
that's
just
a
complete
contradiction
to
say
that.
now,
one
thing
i
think
has
not
been
clearly
brought
out
here
is
to
just
what
was
being
asked
for
in
these
records.
first,
the
request
for
documents
asked
for
the
policies,
and
then
the
court
said
at
the
hearing
on
that,
we'll
get
up
this
list
in
a
general
way.
and
mr.
mellott
then
said,
i
want
to
see
the
policies.
and
then
counsel
for
the
defendants
said
that
the
brokers
had
the
policies,
and
so
mister...
judge
simmons
said,
well,
write
to
the
brokers.
so
we
understood
that
we
were
to
get
the
policies.
then
after
new
york
counsel
had
gone
to
england
to
investigate
the
situation...
and
mr.
mellott's
correct,
he
didn't
talk
to
the
brokers,
he
talked
to
15
of
his
clients,
but
they
knew
about
the
brokers
and
so
forth...
he
came
back
and
he
made
this
affidavit...
and
there's
not
anything
dilatory;
he
did
it
within
the
time...
that
it
would
involve
four
million
files.
now,
he
was
talking
then
about
the
insurers'
own
files,
but
they
would
show
the
same
thing
as
the
brokers'
files.
that
is,
the
contract
is
the
placing
slip
and
the
insurance
company
keeps
that.
the
broker,
as
agent
for
the
insured,
then
prepares
a
policy,
gives
it
to
the
insured
to
sign
and
then
takes
it
back
and
keeps
a
copy
of
it.
so
the
same
information
would
be
in
the
brokers'
files
as
would
be
in
the
insurers'
files.
so
new
york
counsel,
mr.
bruckmann,
thought,
well,
let
us
offer
our
own
files
and
we
will
make
those
available.
they
would
show
the
same
thing
as
the
brokers'
files.
now,
mr.
mellott
says
that
we
never
did
offer
to
produce
the
documents
anywhere.
but
after
i
got
into
the
case,
which
was
after
the
sanctions
had
been
entered,
i
thought,
well,
let's
see
if
we
can
get
the...
offer
to
produce
them
now
and
satisfy
the
court
and
be
done
with
it.
and
so
i
expressly
offered
to
produce
all
these
files
in
london.
and
mr.
mellott
said,
no,
we're
not
interested
in
the
files
relating
to
jurisdiction
now,
and
he
prepared
this
order
and
he
submitted
it
and
the
judge
said
he
was
going
to
sign
it,
barring
us
from
ever
contesting
jurisdiction
again.
and
i
said,
on
the
strength
of
that
i
offer
to
produce
all
these
records
in
london
on
july
2nd,
1979.
that's
right
in
the
record.
so
mr.
mellott
is
incorrect
to
say
we
never
did
offer
to
produce
the
files.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
no...
well,
that
was
my
offer.
but
mr.
bruckmann
before
the
sanction
had
been
entered,
he
offered
to
produce
them
in
london,
and
i
just
repeated
that
offer
in
the
hope
that
it
would
be
accepted
and
we
would
get
the
thing
done.
because
we
were
perfectly
willing
to
produce
our
files,
and
they
could
look
through
them
and
rummage
through
them
all
they
want.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
our
files.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
well,
that
was
because
mr.
mellott's
request
for
documents
asked
for
policies,
and
we
did
not
have
any
policies
in
our
files.
we
had
only
the
placing
slips,
which
were
the
contracts.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
well,
the
indexes...
the
placing
slips
themselves
would,
if
you
looked
at
each
one.
but
the
indexes
did
not
say
which
ones
were
from
pennsylvania,
and
the
same
was
true
of
the
brokers.
they
did
not
have
the
indexes,
either.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
well,
i
think
it
would
have
been.
but
that
was
judge
simmons'
idea,
because
they
wanted...
they
had
asked
expressly
for
the
policies
and
only
the
brokers
had
the
policies.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
no.
no,
that
was
not
said.
that
could
have
been
said.
i
don't
know
whether
the
realized
that
or
what
at
the
time.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
no.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
no,
that
was
wrong.
i
think
judge
simmons
in
effect
did
say
that.
but
that
is
not
correct.
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
jurisdiction.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
he
said
that--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--yes.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes,
yes,
precisely.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes,
that
was
erroneous,
because
all
we
have--
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
--yes.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
all
right.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes,
yes.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes.
mr.
edmund
k.
trent
yes,
because
we
say
that
doesn't
apply
where
it's
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
and
the
familia
de
boom
case
held
exactly
that,
that
even
though
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiff
to
produce
the...
to
prove
jurisdiction,
if
the
plaintiff
couldn't
get
it
it
was
too
bad,
but
he
should
make
other
efforts.
now,
we
say,
as
i
said
before,
that
the
plaintiff
was
not
hamstrung
here.
all
he
had
to
do
was
go
to
london
and
look
at
our
records.
