mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
cross-respondent
that
when
a
party
to
a
litigation
in
a
federal
court
comes
into
the
court
and
asks
for
a
binding
determination
of
no
jurisdiction...
and
incidentally,
it
was
not
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
12(b)
that
was
filed
here.
it
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
was
filed
18
months
after
the
action
was
commenced.
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
asking
the
court
to
determine...
make
a
binding
determination
that
there
was
no
personal
jurisdiction
over
17
of
the
excess
insurers.
now,
not
only
did
the
excess
insurers
come
into
court
and
ask
for
that
action
by
the
court;
the
excess
insurers
took
advantage
of
the
discovery
rules
themselves.
they
served
us
with
a
request
for
production
of
documents.
they
served
us--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--well,
they
asked
us
to
produce
policies
which
they
had
issued
to
cbg
or
to
halco
or
to
another
affiliated
company,
and
to
produce
policies
which
had
been
referred
to
in
an
affidavit
of
marsh
&
mclennan,
policies
which
marsh
&
mclennan,
a
broker
in
pittsburgh,
had
written
for
either
halco,
cbg...
and
when
i
say
cbg
i
mean
the
cross-respondent
here...
or
alcoa,
in
which
marsh
&
mclennan
state
in
the
affidavit
during
a
period,
i
believe,
from
1971
until
1975,
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
they
had
written
numerous
policies
for
each
of
the
excess
insurers
here
involved,
and
they
list
them
by
number...
it
appears
in
the
appendix,
your
honors...
setting
forth
the
number
of
contacts
that
they'd
had
in
pennsylvania.
when
we
tried
to
obtain
additional
information
concerning
policies
written
for
other
companies,
we
of
course
were
unable
to
get
them
from
marsh
&
mclennan.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
justice...
excuse
me.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
it
was
our
position
that
we
had
jurisdiction
on
several
grounds,
and
judge
simmons
so
found
in
his
preliminary
findings
and
in
the
findings
on
the
permanent
injunction.
we
contended,
first
of
all,
that
there
was
sufficient
contacts
in
this
particular
transaction.
i
find
myself
disagreeing
completely
with
the
statement
of
facts
which
mr.
trent
has
stated
to
this
court
and
i
think
the
record
will
support--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--your
honor,
we
also
contended
that
they
had
conducted
sufficient
other
business
in
pennsylvania
so
as
to
meet
the
tests
under
international
shoe
and
other
cases
which
this
court
has
decided.
and
we
contended
that
they
had
adopted
the
primary
policy.
you
see,
we
have
a
policy
covering
the
first
$10
million
of
loss
with
ina
insurance
company
in
philadelphia,
in
pennsylvania.
the
excess
insurers
do
not
deny
that
they
adopted
the
terms
of
the
primary
policy.
but
they
would
have
us
sue
ina
in
pennsylvania
and
them,
at
least
some
of
them,
in
london
and
one
of
them
in
brussels.
we
submit
that
when
they
adopted
the
terms
of
the
primary
policy
they
were
subject
to
suit
where
the
primary
insurer
was
subject
to
suit.
we
also
contend
that
there
was
an
implied
term
in
the
policy
that
they
would
consent
to
suit
in
pennsylvania.
other
policies...
and
they're
listed
in
the
record...
other
policies
had
been
issued
to
my
client
previously
in
which
most
of
the
excess
insurers
were
involved,
in
which
there
was
a
consent
to
suit
clause,
anywhere.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
well,
your
honor,
obviously
i
was
trying
to
prove
jurisdiction
on
one
of
several
grounds,
and
the
defendants
were
contending
that
they
didn't
do
enough
business
here...
or
in
pennsylvania...
to
be
subject
to
suit
there.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
they're
coming
into
court
and
asking
the
court
to
make
a
binding
determination
of
no
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
they
don't
have
sufficient
contacts
in
pennsylvania
to
satisfy
the
tests
under
international
shoe,
that
by
doing
so
they've
at
least
agreed
to
produce
or
consented
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
produce
those
facts
which
are
relevant
to
that
determination.
otherwise
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
it's
a
complete
abuse
of
our
judicial
process.
furthermore,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
contrary
to
what
mr.
trent
says,
that
the
excess
insurers
knew
that
ina
was
the
company
that
had
written
the
primary
insurance,
that
they
knew
of
the
contact
with
pennsylvania.
we
have
affidavits
from
the
brokers,
we
have
testimony
on
depositions.
the
excess
layer
was
$10
million.
40
percent
of
that
was
reinsured
with
ina
reinsurance
in
brussels.
the
same
london
broker
who
the
excess
insurers
would
have
this
court
believe
for
all
purposes
is
the
agent
of
my
client,
at
the
same
time
they
were
negotiating
the
excess
layer
of
coverage,
they
were
also
negotiating
the
reinsurance,
not
for
my
clients
but
for
the
excess
insurers,
with
ina
reinsurance
in
brussels.
that
company
took
40
percent
of
this
excess
layer
of
$10
million.
that
company
is
an
affiliated
company
with
the
primary
carrier.
that
company
had
full
information
in
its
files,
furnished
by
the
broker,
concerning
cbg,
its
u.s.
connection,
the
fact
it
was
a
delaware
corporation,
who
its
owners
were,
completely
consistent
with
the
affidavit
of
the
london
brokers
as
to
what
they
had
in
their
files
and
what
was
available
for
the
excess
insurers
to
see.
now,
if
they
gave
it
to
the
reinsurance
company,
i
submit
there
is
reason
to
believe
it
was
also
given
to
all
of
the
excess
insurers.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
misstatements
of
fact
which
appear
in
the
brief
and
which
were
repeated
here
again
today.
now,
the
only
way
that
i
can
explain
it
is
that
mr.
trent
came
into
this
case
some
time
after
the
sanctions
were
entered.
i've
been
in
the
case
from
the
beginning.
there
was
never
a
question
at
any
time
in
any
of
the
proceedings
as
to
whether
the
documents
had
to
be
produced
in
pittsburgh
or
in
london.
there
was
never
an
objection
made
by
the
excess
insurers
on
that
basis.
i
never
refused
to
go
to
london
to
look
at
documents.
the
court
never
really
ordered
them
to
produce
them
in
pittsburgh.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
mr.
trent
should
know,
i
went
to
london
and
to
europe,
to
brussels,
both
before
and
after
this
offer
that
was
made
four
months
after
they
were
ordered
to
produce
the
documents,
to
look
at
documents
when
the
documents
were
produced.
what
did
happen
here?
a
motion...
after
they
filed
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
claiming
no
in
personam
jurisdiction
because,
they
said,
they
didn't
have
sufficient
contact...
the
fact
is
they
had
initially
filed
affidavits
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
which
all
17
denied
any
business
in
pennsylvania.
but
after
we
filed
counter-affidavits
establishing
business
to
the
extent
that
we
were
able
to
prove
it,
they
filed
new
affidavits,
in
13
of
which
these
excess
insurers
acknowledge
under
oath
that
they
are
engaged
in
writing
insurance
and
covering
risks
on
a
worldwide
basis.
they
don't
exclude
pennsylvania.
pennsylvania
is
a
rather
commercial
state,
with
a
lot
of
industries
that
are
engaged
in
business
worldwide.
in
some
of
these
affidavits
we
find
representations
that
they
conducted...
that
they
had
reviewed
some
of
their
files
and
that
they
had
determined
that
certain
percentages,
either
one
percent
more
or
less,
had
been
determined
to
be
derived
from
pennsylvania.
now,
that's
not
just
in
a
representation
of
counsel,
as
i
understood
mr.
trent
to
indicate
to
the
court
previously.
it
is
in
signed,
sworn
affidavits
of
the
excess
insurers.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
asked
the
question
about,
how
did
they
know.
well,
presumably,
at
least
the
representation
made
to
the
court
was
that
the
files
had
been
reviewed
to
support
the
affidavit,
not
that
they
had
some
general
understanding
out
of
the
air.
now,
it
may
be,
and
i
submit
should
be,
that
one
percent
of
their
premium
income,
which
in
all
probability
runs
into
the
millions
of
dollars,
is
enough
contact
with
pennsylvania
to
meet
the
test
of
international
shoe.
and
when
they...
when
we
were
in
court
and
they
asked
whether
that
wasn't
adequate,
whether
i
wasn't
satisfied
with
that,
i
said
that
if
you
are
still
contending
that
that
extent
of
business
does
not
meet
the
regularity
test
then
i
want
you
to
produce
the
documents,
as
you
were
originally
ordered
to
do.
and
they
said,
what
difference...
the
lawyer
said,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
one
or
two
percent?
well,
i
offered
to
withdraw
the
request
for
production
of
documents
if
they
would
acknowledge
that
the
one
or
two
percent
of
their
business
was
sufficient
to
meet
the
tests
of
the
pennsylvania
long
arm
statute
and
the
requirement
of
international
shoe.
they
were
not
willing
to
do
that.
they
still
contended
that
the
contacts
were
not
adequate.
now,
they
were
originally
ordered
to
produce,
on
july
27th,
1978.
mr.
trent
would
have
you
believe,
and
in
fact
says
so
in
his
brief
and
in
his
reply
brief
and
intimated
it
again
today,
that
the
lawyers
from
new
york,
who
are
experienced
insurance
lawyers
in
the
international
insurance
field,
immediately
went
to
london
to
contact
the
brokers.
in
fact,
that's
what
he
says
in
his
brief.
there's
no
citation
to
the
record
for
that.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
your
honor,
i
think
that
matter
was
never
settled.
they
never
objected.
at
any
time
there
was
any
discussion
about
this
matter
on
the
record,
your
honor,
they
never
objected
that
it
was
the
burden
to
bring
it
to
pittsburgh.
that's
not
in
their
objections.
the
burdensomeness
that
they
objected
to
was
the
collection
of
the
documents.
the
only
objections
in
the
record
to
this
production,
contrary
to
what
mr.
trent
has
indicated
in
his
brief
and
again
today,
are
objections
as
to
relevancy...
i
think
it's
clearly
relevant...
and
objections
as
to
burdensomeness
from
the
standpoint
of
having
to
contact
the
brokers
to
get
the
documents.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
well,
your
honor,
in
the
order
which
the
judge
entered
there
was
no
provision
for
place
of
production.
and
we
had
gone
to
london
previously
to
look
at
documents.
we
were
perfectly
willing
to
go
again,
and
i'm
sure
the
lawyers
so
understood.
that
to
me
is
a
red
herring
that's
come
into
the
case
after
the
sanctions
were
entered.
it's
not
something
that
was
involved
at
all.
we
went
to
london
and
looked
at
their
documents.
we
went
to
brussels
and
looked
at
documents.
we
did
it
both
before
and
afterwards.
now,
the
problem
is,
at
the
july
27th,
'78,
hearing
the
counsel
from
new
york
told
the
court
they'd
have
to
contact
brokers,
there
were
150
brokers
involved.
in
fact,
they
had
filed
an
affidavit
earlier
that
day
in
which
they
said
there'd
be
150
brokers
involved
and
it
would
require
contacts.
the
judge
suggested
that
a
letter
be
written
to
the
brokers,
a
form
letter.
this
is
in
july.
and
there
was
no
objection
at
that
time
that
they
were
outside
of
the
control
of
the
excess
insurers.
when
was
the
letter
finally
written
to
the
brokers?
six
months
later,
in
january
1979.
even
though
at
the
july
hearing
their
counsel
is
saying,
the
documents
you
want
are
in
the
hands
of
the
brokers,
they're
not
saying,
however,
that
they're
outside
their
control...
and
if
i
understood
mr.
trent
today,
he's
now
not
suggesting
that
either,
because
i
think
clearly
they
are
not
outside
the
control
of
the
excess
insurers...
instead
of
immediately
going
to
london,
as
mr.
trent
indicates
in
his
brief,
and
in
his
reply
brief,
and
again
today,
they
admitted
five
months
later
at
the
december
hearing
that
they
hadn't
contacted
even
one
broker,
five
months
after
they
had
been
ordered
to
do
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
only
contacted
15
of
their
21
clients.
they
hadn't
even
contacted
all
of
them.
and
that's
conclusively
established
by
the
affidavit
that
they
filed
in
november,
and
by
the--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--it's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
the
affidavit
is
at
98a
and
99a.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
of
the
appendix,
volume
one.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
volume
one,
your
honor.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
now,
the
admission
as
to
the
fact
that
they
hadn't
contacted
any
brokers
as
late
as
five
months
after
they
were
originally
ordered
to
produce
the
documents
and
the
judge
had
originally
suggested
that
they
do
it
appears
in
the
transcript
of
the
december
27,
19...
or
december
21,
1978,
hearing,
which
also
appears
in
the
joint
appendix,
volume
one.
it
starts
on
page
105a.
at
none
of
the...
well,
first
of
all,
the
judge
gave
them
all
the
time
they
wanted
in--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--not
these
documents,
your
honor;
other
documents.
not
these
documents.
they
did
produce
some
other
documents,
your
honor,
but
not
these.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
your
honor,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
sanction
was
he
entered,
except
for
the
offer
to
produce
four
million
files...
and
while
it's
been
characterized
in
the
brief
and
here
today
as
being
a
list
of
the
north
american
files,
it
was
never
so
identified
to
us,
nor
was
it
so
identified
in
any
of
the
papers
or
in
any
of
the
discussions.
all
it
was
was
an
indication
to
us
that
they
would
open
the
files
of
15
of
the
excess
insurers.
that's
were
the
four
million
files
were
supposed
to
be
located.
at
the
same
time
they're
telling
us
that
the
files
are
in
the
hands...
the
documents
that
they
were
ordered
to
produce
are
in
the
hands
of
the
brokers.
so
these
four
million
files
may
or
may
not
contain
what
they
were
ordered
to
produce.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
all
right.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
judge
simmons
did
not
order
the
production
of
these
four
million
files.
he
ordered...
and
he
changed
our
request
after
the
counsel
for
the
excess
insurers
had
presented
arguments.
all
they
were
ordered
to
do
was
to
give
us
names
of
the
policies,
the
policy
numbers
and
the
general
outline
of
those
policies
which
had
a
pennsylvania
contact,
either
by
being
written
for
a
pennsylvania
insured,
being
written
through
a
pennsylvania
broker,
or
covering
a
risk
in
pennsylvania.
now,
that's
what
they
were
ordered
to
do.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
when
they
made
this
offer,
four
months
after
they
had
been
originally
ordered
to
produce,
it
was
not
an
offer
that
complied
with
what
they'd
been
ordered
to
do.
i
mean,
on
the
one
hand
they're
telling
us
they
don't
have
the
files,
they're
with
the
brokers...
although
they
never
said
that
they
were
outside
their
control...
i
mean,
that
they
didn't
have
the
documents.
on
the
other
hand,
after
coming
to
the
court
at
the
end
of
the
90
days,
asking
for
an
extension
of
time
and
representing
to
the
court
that
in
all
probability
we
can
comply
with
the
court's
order
within
30
days,
and
the
court
granted
an
extension
of
an
additional
30
days,
all
we
get
is
a
two-page
affidavit,
the
end
of
november,
four
months
later,
which
simply
says
15
of
the
companies
will
open
their
files.
now,
those
are
not
the
documents
the
court
ordered
produced.
there
was
not
even
any
representation
that
those
included
the
documents
which
were
produced.
in
fact,
if
you
believe
them
when
they
say
that
the
documents
that
we
were
requesting
were
in
the
possession
of
the
brokers,
those
files
didn't
even
include
any
of
them.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
well,
i
think
the
court
did,
your
honor,
and
i
think
by
virtue
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
national
hockey
league
case
that's
required.
if
sanctions
are
going
to
mean
anything
and
have
any
deterring
effect,
you
can't
say
that
once
the
sanction
has
been
entered
it
can
be
removed
by
compliance
later.
all
that'll
do
is
bring
about
a
complete
abuse
of
the
discovery
process.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
your
honor,
i
submit
that
it
was
not...
and
i'm
not
even
sure
that
it's
the
case
today.
the
defendants
haven't
even
today,
so
far
as
i
know,
offered
to
produce
the
documents
which
they
were
ordered
to
produce.
now,
mr.
trent
after
he
got
into
the
case
made
a
new
offer,
and
it's
not
clear
from
the
offer
whether
he's
talking
about
producing
the
documents
including
those
from
the
brokers
or
whether
he's
talking
about
the
same
four
million
files.
but
in
any
event,
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
with
what
mr.
trent
said
about
my
view
as
to
whether
the
lawyers
acted
in
good
faith
or
not.
i
do
not
believe
they
acted
in
good
faith.
i
think
they
did
not
act
in
good
faith,
as
the
third
circuit
found.
and
i
think
a
review
of
the
record
will
make
it
very
clear
here
they
did
not
act
in
good
faith.
and
the
judge
gave
them
nine
months
to
comply--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
that's
in
the
record...
and
i
submit
that
there
is
adequate
evidence
in
the
record
for
the
court
to
find
jurisdiction
even
now
on
the
face--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--well,
that
may
be,
except
that
there's
a
lot
of
money
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and...
the
suit
was
filed
in
december
'75.
here
we
are
in
march
of
1982.
and
most
of
the
reason
why
this
case
isn't
to
trial--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
continue
with
my
response
to
justice
stevens'
question.
there
are
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
response
to
your
question
as
to
whether
a
money
sanction
wouldn't
have
been
better.
maybe
i
haven't
phrased
it
exactly
as
you
did,
your
honor.
in
the
money
sanction,
as
i
understand
it,
you
were
suggesting
that
they
pick
up
the
expenses
that
were
involved
from
the
delay.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
type
of
a
sanction
would
have
no
deterrent
effect
on
the
type
of
misconduct
that
was
engaged
in
here,
particularly
in
a
time
of
high
inflation,
which
we
had
during
the
period
of
dilatory
tactics.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
deterring
other
people,
your
honor.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
well,
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--well,
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
really
primarily
concerned
in
this
case.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
the
sanction
that
was
imposed
here
is
fully
in
accordance
with
the
provision
of
rule
37(b)(2)(a),
which
presumes
under
that
rule
that
the
facts
which
would
be
established
if
the
discovery
were
complied
with
are
deemed
to
be
established.
and
that's
exactly
what
judge
simmons
did,
and
he
did
it
only
after
he
had
warned
them,
five
months
after
he
had
originally
ordered
the
production,
he
warned
them
that
if
the
production
wasn't
made
in
another
60
days
the
sanction
of
the
type
he's
mentioned
would
be
entered.
he
gave
them
actually
120
days,
so
that
they
had
a
total
of
nine
months
to
comply.
and
they
didn't
comply.
furthermore,
i
submit
that
sanction
is
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and...
the
rule,
rule
37,
and
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
national
hockey
league
case,
in
which
the
sanction
of
dismissal
was
used,
which
is
even
more
severe
than
the
sanction
here
involved.
at
least
they
still
have
an
opportunity
to
defend
on
the
merits.
furthermore,
i
think
it's
in
accordance
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
hammond
packing
case,
in
which
a
sanction
of
a
dismissal--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--well,
your
honor,
on
that
point,
i
submit
that
when
a
party
comes
into
court
and
asks
the
court
to
make
a
binding
determination
that
there
is
no
personal
jurisdiction
over
him,
and
when
that
party
engages
in
discovery
against
another
party
already
in
the
case--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
when
they
come
into
court
and
ask
for
a
binding
determination
of
the
court,
as
the
fourth
circuit
held
in
the
lekkas
case
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
they
are
deemed
to
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
at
least
to
the
point
of
providing
relevant
evidence
on
the
issue
that
they've
asked
the
court
to
decide.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
complete
misuse
of
our
judicial
process--
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it
would
be
a
real
misuse
of
process
to
say
on
the
one
hand,
as
this
court
has
said,
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
determine
jurisdiction,
and
that
a
party
can
come
in
and
invoke
that
jurisdiction
and
yet
say:
but
i'm
not
going
to
produce
the
evidence
that's
relevant
to
that
determination;
you
have
to
decide
it
on
what
evidence
is
in
the
record;
i'm
not
going
to
produce
the
evidence
that's
in
my
possession.
now,
that's
what
the
excess
insurers
ask
this
court
to
hold.
i
submit
that
that
would
be
clearly
improper.
i
also
would
argue
that
this
is
a
question...
the
test
here
is,
did
judge
simmons
abuse
his
discretion
in
applying
this
sanction?
he
warned
them
that
it
would
be
applied.
they
elected
not
to
comply.
and
as
i
said
this
morning,
i
do
not
believe
that
their
offer,
their
belated
offer
to
open
files
of
15
excess
insurers,
was
a
compliance
with
the
order
to
produce
certain
specific
documents
which
they
say
are
in
the
hands
of
the
brokers,
so
they
couldn't
have
been
in
the
files
that
they
were
offering
to
produce
in
any
event.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
but
we
have
made
a
claim
and
we've
amended
the
complaint
to
ask
for
an
inflation
factor,
and
the
court
has
permitted
that
amendment.
now,
whether
we'll
be
able
to
sustain
it
ultimately
or
not
i
don't
know.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
the
court
permitted
the
amendment
only,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
believe
some
of
you
asked
me
questions
this
morning
about,
why
did
you
go
ahead
with
the
discovery
if
you
felt
so
confident
there
was
jurisdiction.
well,
if
this
court
holds
from
the
contacts,
as
i
believe
it
could
on
the
basis
of
international
shoe,
that
there's
no
need
for
this
discovery,
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
of
contacts
in
the
record,
as
i
believe
there
is,
then
of
course...
i
don't
need
the
sanction,
because
there's
no
appeal
from
this
decision.
but
i
felt
that
i
had
to
assert
jurisdiction
on
every
ground
available
to
me,
and
that's
what
i
tried
to
do,
as
long
as
they
were
trying
to
contend
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
jurisdiction.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
primarily
based
on
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
the
national
hockey
league
case.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
that
was
done
subsequently
by
an
order
of
court,
your
honor,
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
one
of
the
grounds
for
jurisdiction
was
that
he
had
imposed
a
sanction
under
rule
37(b)(2)(a)
and
based
on
the
national
hockey
league
case,
that
that
issue
should
not
be
further
litigated.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
that's
right,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
the
national
hockey
league
case
that
if
you
permit
them
to
avoid
the
sanction
after
it's
been
imposed
by
then
complying
with
the
court
order,
all
you'd
get
would
be
dilatory
tactics.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
the
court
actually,
in
the
preliminary
injunction
order
and
in
the
permanent
injunction
order,
found
jurisdiction
on
several
grounds.
mr.
cloyd
r.
mellott
including
the
sanction.
and
the
court
has
held
that,
in
view
of
the
entry
of
the
sanction,
that
the
issue
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
is
no
longer
open
for
litigation,
that
it's
finally
binding
on
the
parties
in
this
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
incorrectly,
dismissed
as
to
three
of
the
defendants,
and
that's
part
of
what
is
included
in
our
petition
for
cert
to
this
court,
which
the
court
presently
has
under
consideration,
because
we
believe
there
is
adequate
evidence
of
contacts
in
the
record.
there
is
also
evidence
that
they
did
not
comply
with
the
order,
either.
and
our
petition
for
cert
also
includes
the
injunction,
a
point
which
they--
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
