unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
at
that
time,
mr.
trent,
say
where
the
production
should
take
place?
unknown
speaker
is
that
disputed
at
all
or
does
everybody
agree?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
insofar
as
i
was
able
to
determine
reading
the
briefs,
the
defendants
at
trial
indicated
that
that
would
basically
be
possible;
it
was
a
question
of
when,
not
if.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
that
position
was
articulated
at
all
times
before
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
that
it
was
impossible
physically?
unknown
speaker
mr.
trent,
before
you
get
into
your
argument
could
i
ask
just
perhaps
kind
of
a
stupid
question?
what
is
the
position
of
these
british
insurance
companies
as
to
where
they
should
properly
be
sued?
unknown
speaker
that
if
an
american
company
enters
into
an
insurance...
gets
insurance
from
an
english
company,
they're
expected
to
sue
in
london?
unknown
speaker
and
they
wouldn't
even
have
been
subject
to
suit
in
west
africa,
either?
unknown
speaker
mr.
trent,
that's
i
think
the
third
time
you've
used
the
phrase
"young
new
york
lawyers".
i
take
it
you
wish
in
some
way
to
disassociate
yourself
from--
unknown
speaker
--excusing
them
for
what?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
have
authority
to
represent
your
clients
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
and
we
must
presume
they
are
duly
admitted
and
competent
lawyers,
even
though
they're
young.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
was
the
court's
order
to
produce
only
the
files
on
policies
issued
by
these
companies
to
people
in
pennsylvania,
or
was
the
order
to
produce
all
four
million
files?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
not
the
court's
order,
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
how
much
easier
would
it
have
been
to
get
into
these
records
in
london
once
they're
identified?
unknown
speaker
mr.
trent,
if
i
find
myself
unable
to
excuse
what
these
lawyers
did
because
they're
young
lawyers
from
new
york,
do
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
if
i
find
that
i
just
can't
excuse
them--
unknown
speaker
--because
they're
young
and
inexperienced--
unknown
speaker
--did
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
well,
you
act
like
it.
unknown
speaker
i
took
it
that
your
reference
to
these
young
men
was
to
indicate
that
there
was
no
deliberate,
there
was
no
xx
conduct
on
their
part.
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
have
been
compliance
with
the
order
for
your
people
in
london
to
search
through
the
files
and
found
those
that
showed
american
business
and
just
brought
those?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
if
plaintiff's
counsel
went
over
the
files
would
be
available
to
them.
but
it
would
also
be
a
herculean
task
for
the
plaintiff's
counsel.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
way
in
which
these
companies
can
find
any
shortcuts
to
know
how
much
business
they've
done
in
pennsylvania,
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
how
would
they
even
know
about
the
one
percent?
that's
what
puzzles
me.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i'd
assume
there'd
be
some
executives
who
would
remember
some
policies
that
came
from--
unknown
speaker
--there
was
no
attempt
to
sort
of
say,
well,
maybe
we...
if
we
give
you
everything
we
can
find
in
the
first
few
days
of
search
or
something.
sometimes
these
things
can
be
worked
out.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
your
position,
then,
that
the
extreme
nature
of
the
discovery
required
by
the
district
court,
as
you
regard
it,
really
doesn't
have
any
bearing
on
this
case,
because
i
take
it
you
would
have
objected
on
your
jurisdictional
argument
to
even
requiring
one
witness
who
resided
in
pittsburgh
to
be
deposed
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
unknown
speaker
how
many
documents?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mellott,
it
was
never
clear
to
me
reading
the
briefs
whether
it
was
your
position
in
the
lawsuit
that
your
clients
had
jurisdiction
because
of
the
pennsylvania
contacts
related
to
these
particular
policies
alone,
or
whether
it
was
your
position
that
there
was
jurisdiction
because
the
original
defendants
had
done
so
much
business
in
pennsylvania
that
there
was
general
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
were
willing
to
rest
on
that
you
wouldn't
need
all
these
four
million
files.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
an
implied
term
in
the
policy,
why
is
there
any
need
for
an
express
consent
to
suit
clause?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
trent
that
the
order
to
produce
did
contemplate
production
in
pittsburgh?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
think
it
contemplated
production?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
as
you
say
there
really
was
no
place
for
production
specified,
then
they
would
have
had
no
occasion
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
it
was
too
burdensome
to
bring
it,
once
it
had
been
assembled,
from
london
to
pittsburgh.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mellott--
--where
is
that
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
need
to
take
your
time
hunting
it
up.
unknown
speaker
of?
unknown
speaker
what
volume,
what
volume?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you
went
to
london
and
looked
at
the
documents?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
any
attempt
to
review
these
documents
for
business
in
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
well,
time
is
getting
away
and
i
have
two
questions--
unknown
speaker
--i'd
really
like
to
hear
you
address.
and
one
is
the
question
of
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
to
order
the
production
of
four
million
files.
and
secondly,
if
not
and
if
the
court
could
properly
impose
sanctions
in
this
discovery
effort,
was
it
an
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion
to
prevent
any
further
litigation
of
that
problem
at
the
trial
on
the
merits,
the
jurisdictional
question?
unknown
speaker
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
court
had
the
power
to
enter
some
sanction
and
to
compel
discovery
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
its
own
in
personam
jurisdiction,
do
you
think
the
court
also
properly
precluded
any
further
consideration
of
that
issue
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
it
seems
to
me.
maybe
this
particular
sanction
was
not
the
correct
one.
maybe
there
should
have
been
a
monetary
sanction
based
on
all
of
your
time
and
energy
and
interest
and
all
the
rest,
and
delay.
wouldn't
that
serve
a
deterrent
purpose?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
that
goes
to
the
question
of
what
would
be
an
appropriate
sanction.
maybe
you're
dead
right
that
you
were
really
given
a
terrible
run-around
here
and
entitled
to
a
very
severe
sanction.
the
legal
question,
though:
is
it
correct
for
the
sanction
to
be
a
finding
of
jurisdiction
when
in
fact
there
may
be
no
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
really,
you've
spent
an
awful
lot
of
time
on
an
unnecessary
project.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
deterring
other
people
or
being
effective
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
care
about
that?
you
just
want--
unknown
speaker
--to
deter
somebody
in
this
case,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
so
much
concerned
about
the
severity
of
the
sanction
as
the
question
of
the
theory
by
which,
if
there
in
fact
is
no
jurisdiction
how
does
the
court
have
power
to
impose
it?
unknown
speaker
all
these
arguments
are
arguments
that
you
didn't
really
need
the
discovery
that
gave
rise
to
the
particular
order
before
us,
because
those
are
independent
grounds
for
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
would
you
mean
the
court
has
jurisdiction
has
to
determine
its
jurisdiction,
and
that
there
were
efforts,
you
say,
that
frustrated
the
determination
of
jurisdiction
and
therefore
this
drastic
step
is
taken?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
what
interest
will
be
payable
on
the
claims
when,
as
and
if
they're
allowed?
unknown
speaker
permitted
the
amendment?
unknown
speaker
does
the
order
that
was
entered
here
foreclose
any
further
investigation
of
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
was
that
specifically
done
under
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
question
of
jurisdiction
supposedly
is
no
longer
open
in
this
case,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
now
complying
with
a
court
order,
proving
that
there
isn't
jurisdiction.
that
isn't
the
same
as
complying
with
the
order.
unknown
speaker
yes?
unknown
speaker
that's
38a
of
what?
unknown
speaker
volume
one?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
offer
to
produce
them
until
the
sanction
had
been
entered.
unknown
speaker
mr.
trent,
did
your
offer
pertain
to
your
files
or
the
brokers'
files?
unknown
speaker
where
did
i
get
the
notion
that
the
information
was
only
obtainable
from
the
brokers'
files?
what
was
all
this
fussing
around
about
the
brokers'
files?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
also
got
the
impression
that
your
files
wouldn't
disclose
whether
it
was
pennsylvania
business
or--
unknown
speaker
--because
i'm
puzzled
about
why
you
sort
of
shuttled
them
off
to
the
brokers.
it
probably
would
have
been
much
more
efficient
in
the
first
place
to
stay
with
your
files,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't...
your
predecessor
representing
your
client
didn't
happen
to
say,
well,
really
a
quicker
way
to
get
it
would
be
to
look
at
our
own
files
instead
of
going
through
the
policies?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
on
your
theory
of
the
case
or
of
the
rule
the
district
court
would
have
been
justified
in
saying,
i'm
going
to
impose...
i'm
going
to
find
that
there
is
jurisdiction
unless
you
sustain
the
burden
of
proof
that
there
isn't?
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
will
have
to
get
your
own
documents
and
come
in
here
with
proof?
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
judge
say
that?
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
judge
say
that?
unknown
speaker
before
he
imposed
the
sanction?
unknown
speaker
so
he
said
to
you:
look,
i'm
going
to
find
that
there's
jurisdiction
unless
you
come
in
and
prove--
unknown
speaker
--now,
that
is...
and
you
think
that
was
unjustified?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
agree
that
there
had
been
a
refusal
to
discover.
i
know
you
say
there
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
but
assume
there
was.
unknown
speaker
and
you
agree
that
a
sanction,
some
kind
of
an
effective
sanction,
was
justified.
you
say
that
sanction
would
be
bad,
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
on--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
you
had
refused
discovery?
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
the
rule
says
that
you
may,
as
a
sanction
you
may
deem
the
facts
sought
to
have
been
established?
