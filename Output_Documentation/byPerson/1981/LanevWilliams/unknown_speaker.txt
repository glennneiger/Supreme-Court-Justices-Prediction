unknown
speaker
mr.
weinstein,
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts?
as
i
understand
it,
the
relief
granted
by
judge
marshall,
was
it,
in
this
case,
was
to
cancel
the
three-year
mandatory
parole
term,
to
modify
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
and
as
i
also
understand
it,
these
two
respondents
have
actually
served
their
sentences.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
case
moot?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
all
the
judge
has
to
do
is
order...
i
mean,
if
he
had
granted
relief
in
the
form
of
requiring
that
the
man
be
allowed
to
plead
again,
to
enter
a
new
plea,
then
it
wouldn't
be
moot,
because
you
would
set
aside
the
judgment
of
guilt,
which
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
correct
relief
on
habeas
corpus.
i
don't
understand
the
relief
on
habeas
corpus
where
you
modify
a
sentence.
where
does
the
judge
get
the
power
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
they
are
unwise
to
seek
that
relief,
but
isn't
that
the
only
relief
the
statute
offered
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinstein,
certainly
this
court
has
virtually
bent
itself
into
a
corkscrew
on
mootness
on
behalf
of
habeas
plaintiffs
in
cases
like
sedbaum
versus
new
york
and
carafas
versus
lavalay,
talking
about
the
future
consequences,
denial
of
job
opportunities,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
as
to
mootness,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
question
is--
unknown
speaker
--well,
maybe
it
would
be
unfortunate,
but
if
it
is
moot,
we
don't
have
any
power
to
do
anything
about
it.
unknown
speaker
and
the
cases
justice
rehnquist
referred
to
were
cases
where
there
were
collateral
consequences
of
the
conviction
which
was
set
aside.
here
the
conviction
stands,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--when
they
asked
for
habeas
corpus,
where
were
they?
unknown
speaker
where
were
then
when
the
very
latest
petition,
habeas
corpus--
unknown
speaker
--their
relief
was
denied?
unknown
speaker
was
their
relief
denied
or
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
when
was
it
granted?
unknown
speaker
and
they
were
in
prison
then?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
question
about
their
having
exhausted
state
remedies?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
had
they
exhausted
state
remedies?
you
still
don't
know,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
that
it
would
be
futile.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
the
rule
around
in
illinois,
that
you
don't
need
to
exhaust
state
remedies
in
those--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
collateral
relief...
there
was
no...
at
least
there
is
no
collateral
relief
available
now
in
illinois
for
these
people?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand,
mr.
weinstein,
getting
back
to
my
brother
stevens'
question
to
you,
what
happens
to
them
if
you
prevail?
are
they
now
released,
did
i
understand
you
to
say?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
my
question
is,
what
happens
to
these
petitioners?
unknown
speaker
williams
and
southall.
what
happens
to
them?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
habeas
ordinarily
ends
up,
if
the
habeas
petitioner
prevails,
in
a
release,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
prevail
here,
you
can't
put
them
back
in
prison,
as
i
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
to?
unknown
speaker
you
just
want
to
restore
their
mandatory
parole,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
will
there
then
be,
if
you
prevail,
will
they
from
now
on
be
on
mandatory
parole?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
to
me
then
is,
they
do
not...
if
you
prevail,
they
will
not
be
restored
to
mandatory
parole.
unknown
speaker
then
why
isn't
it
moot?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
case
moot?
unknown
speaker
if
they
commit
crimes
in
the
future.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
you
do,
the
records
are
going
to
be
the
same.
certainly
the
recidivist
statute...
this
would
be
a
conviction
of
a
crime
with
a
mandatory
parole
sentence
on
their
record
that
if
we
reversed
and
it
would
not
be
if
we
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
explain
that
to
me.
as
i
understand
it,
the
conviction
of
the
crime
will
remain,
no
matter
what
happens
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
records
that
show
that
they
violated
their
parole
will
remain
there.
unknown
speaker
all
you
want
to
do
is
get
rid
of
the
opinion.
well,
the
significance
of
the--
--isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
the
judgment--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
it
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
need
only
show
that
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
granted
on
the
record
if
you
lose
this
case?
didn't
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
really
mean
that
the
plea
was
invalid?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
there
has
been
no
conviction.
unknown
speaker
in
which
event
if
you
lose
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--he
would
be
entitled
to
have
his
record
show
that
he
was
never
properly
convicted.
unknown
speaker
and
have
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
have
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
the
relief,
but
the
rationale
was
that
he
was
never
convicted.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
want
that
kind
of
a
record
to...
you
want
the
record
to
show
he
was
properly
convicted.
unknown
speaker
and
you
surely,
i
take
it,
do
not
want
it
sent
back
if
judge
marshall,
district
judge
marshall
was
in
error.
you
don't
want
it
sent
back
and
have
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
although...
the
potential
sentence
was
up
to
20
years
here,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
a
new
trial,
in
your
view,
could
they
be
given
a
sentence
exceeding
the
one
that
was
originally
given,
even
though
it
would
have
then
been
declared
to
be
a
nullity?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
weinstein,
i
thought
you
answered
me
earlier
that
if
you
win,
nothing
can
happen
to
these
fellows.
you
can't
get
them
back
to
prison.
how
can
they
retry
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
judgment
setting
aside
the
conviction?
judge
marshall
certainly
entered
no
such
judgment.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
ask
for
any
such
judgment,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
ask
to
have
the
judgment
set
aside,
as
i
remember
the
record.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
even
allege
they
wouldn't
have
pleaded
guilty.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
want
the
plea
set
aside
because
they
might
be
retried.
unknown
speaker
whereas,
if
they
just
expunge
their
mandatory
parole,
they
are
home
free.
unknown
speaker
and
if
retried,
they
might
get
a
sentence
conceivably
ten
years,
and
then
you
would
have
another
case
to
test
whether
they
could
have
an
increased
sentence
the
second
time
around.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinstein,
how
can
you
retry
them
without
setting
aside
the
judgment
of
convictions?
yes.
how
can
you
treat
this
as
if
it
were
an
invalid
plea,
which
meant
that
the
conviction
was
improper?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us.
unknown
speaker
the
rationale
that
the
district
court
used.
well,
it
was
one
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
that
raised
the
question
whether
judge
marshall
had
authority
to
do
what
he
did,
that
is,
to
modify
the
sentence
by
striking
the
mandatory
parole.
he
either
had
to
grant
full
relief,
which
meant
a
new
trial,
or
nothing.
unknown
speaker
did
baker
come
here,
mr.
weinstein?
unknown
speaker
but
santobello
was
a
very
different
case.
santobello
was
a
case
where
there
was
deliberate
misrepresentation
and
withholding
information
from
the
court.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
present
here.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
particularly
so
if
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
man
was...
had
not
been
informed
by
his
counsel,
for
example,
of
the
three-year
mandatory
sentence...
mandatory
parole
provision?
unknown
speaker
if
the
petitioner
seeking
habeas
corpus
failed
to
allege
that
he
was
misled,
that
is,
that
his
lawyer
didn't
tell
him
that
there
was
a
three-year
mandatory
parole,
and
that
the
court
didn't
tell
him,
are
you
suggesting
that
that
is
a
prerequisite
to
any
relief
in
a
case
like
this,
under
the
illinois
rules?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinstein,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
mootness
point
for
a
minute,
since
several
of
my
colleagues
as
well
as
i
seem
to
be
interested
in
it.
the
decision
we
are
reviewing
is
that
of
the
seventh
circuit
set
forth...
which
begins
on
page
45
of
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
case,
in
judge
cummings'
opinion,
he
referred
on
page
46--
unknown
speaker
--to
an
earlier
case
in
which
the
seventh
circuit
had
held
the
petitions
were
not
moot
because
of
the
surviving
consequences.
unknown
speaker
so
at
least
that
obviously
doesn't
bind
this
court,
but
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
feel
that
the
case
was
moot.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
no
more
moot
now
than
it
was
then.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
cite
on
the
case
on
the
illinois
supreme
court
case
that--
unknown
speaker
--wills.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
there
any
representation
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
that
in
fact
they
were
not
aware
of
the
mandatory--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
move
from
there
to
a
hypothetical.
suppose
hypothetically
that
a
lawyer
representing
him
felt
that
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
confronted
with
this,
he
had
an
obligation
to
the
court
to
inform
the
court
that
before
going
in
on
the
plea
he
had
in
fact
advised
that
there
was
a
mandatory...
three-year
mandatory
parole
provision.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--why
doesn't
it
logically
follow
that
to
get
any
relief
at
all,
there
must
be
a
representation
that
counsel
did
not
advise,
that
he
was
not
informed
by
anyone,
and
that
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing
did
not
inform
him,
all
three
of
these
things?
unknown
speaker
when
they
were
tried
and
sentenced
originally,
did
they
have
counsel?
unknown
speaker
they
had--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
is
counsel.
i
suppose
if
the
state
wanted
to
create
an
issue,
they
could
have
a
trial
on
whether
or
not,
a,
they
were
told,
or
whether
their
lawyers
knew
or
should
have
known.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
think...
would
you
think
there
was
a
breach
of
the
plea
bargain
if
it
were
tried
out
and
it
was
found
or
they
admitted
that,
yes,
we
knew
of
the
special
parole
term,
but
the
judge
didn't
advise
us
of
it?
unknown
speaker
i
as
sure
there
wasn't
a
mention
of
it,
but
how
about
knowledge
that
there
was
on
the
part
of
at
least
the
attorneys?
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
brief
says...
i
haven't
checked
the
appendix...
that
the
respondent
alleged
that
he
didn't
appeal
because
he
didn't
know
about
the
imposition...
that
he
would
be
subject
to
mandatory
parole,
which
i
thought
fairly
alleged
that
he
did
not
know.
i
thought
the
record
did...
and
then
i
thought
also
the
record
showed
that
he
found
out
just
about
a
month
before
he
was
to
be
released.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
therefore,
it
seemed
to
me,
the
record
did
establish
that
at
the
time
of
the
plea
they
did
not
know
about
the
mandatory
parole.
unknown
speaker
that,
i
take
it,
would
go
only
to
themselves,
and
not
their
attorneys.
unknown
speaker
they
might
have
a
malpractice
problem.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
i
have
lost
track
of
your
answer
to
the
query
whether
or
not
the
public
defender
had
a
duty
to
inform
his
client
of
the
provision
of
illinois
law
that
provided
for
this
term.
unknown
speaker
they
all
neglected
it.
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
district
judge...
from
what
source
did
his
power
come
to
strike
the
mandatory
sentence
as
distinguished
from
ordering
the
total
relief,
that
is,
set
aside
the
judgment
of
conviction?
unknown
speaker
ms.
mills,
if
you
lose
today,
what
happens
to
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
you
mean--
unknown
speaker
--that
there
would
be
a
change
in
the
prison
record?
that
is
all?
unknown
speaker
they
couldn't
be
retried?
they
can't
go
back
to
prison
or
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
will
the
judgment
of
conviction
be
expunged?
unknown
speaker
they
haven't
asked
for
it
yet.
i
would
think
they
might.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
the
theory
on
which
your
clients
would
get
relief
is
that
the
plea
was
not
voluntarily
entered
into?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
judge
under
illinois
state
law
was
required
to
provide
for
mandatory
parole,
you
don't
think
that
the
remedy
and
the
only
remedy
is
to
set
aside
the
plea
agreement
entirely
and
start
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
happened
in
other
states
and
other
circumstances,
and
not
infrequently.
now,
that
would
have
the
effect,
would
it
not,
of
expunging
the
parole
violation?
you
would
set
it
aside
and
start
over.
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
entire
sentence.
let
them
start
over.
either
with
a
new
trial
or
a
new
plea.
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
addition,
ms.
mills,
certainly
we
can't
order
that
the
conviction
be
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
it
is
not
relevant,
but
if,
as
you
suggest,
this
judgment
and
the
sentence
was
invalid,
and
i
take
it
that
that
is
what
you
have
told
us,
do
these
people
have
some
kind
of
a
tort
claim
action
against
the
state
of
illinois
for
unlawful
confinement
for
whatever
number
of
years
they
were
confined?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
surprising
if
such
a
claim
were
made
these
days,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
good
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
illinois
courts
aren't
bound
by
the
baker
case,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
but
hasn't
this
court
held...
didn't
it
hold
back
in
the
early
seventies
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
not
bound
to
follow
a
case
of
the
seventh
circuit?
