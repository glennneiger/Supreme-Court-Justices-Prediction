mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
decision
conflicts
with
this
court's
1979
decision
in
united
states
versus
timmreck,
and
thereby
goes
beyond
those
due
process
requirements
required
for
a
knowing
and
voluntary
guilty
plea.
in
other
words,
does
timmreck
mandate
a
contrary
result?
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
does
indeed
conflict
with
timmreck.
we
believe
that
if
any
error
occurred,
it
was
only
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
formal
requirements
of
illinois
supreme
court
rule
402.
that
is
the
illinois
rule
which
pertains
to
the
entry
of
guilty
pleas,
and
it
is
the
state
counterpart
to
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
which
was
the
issue,
or
which
was
the
rule
involved
in
timmreck.
we
also
submit
that
rule
402
is
very
similar
in
content
to
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
rule
11...
criminal
procedure.
therefore,
we
believe--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
the
question
arose
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
first
time
it
was
before
the
seventh
circuit,
and
that
court
ruled
and,
we
believe,
correctly,
that
there
were
certain
collateral
consequences
that
would
attach
to
the
petitioners...
at
that
time
there
were
three,
actually
four...
if
the
use
of
their
parole
term
or
the
fact
that
they
had
violated
parole
and
had
started
to
serve
a
parole
term
could
later
be
used
if
they
committed
another
crime
in
that
regard.
however,
more
importantly,
perhaps,
we
perceive
a
situation
of,
because
the
parole
terms
are
so
short...
at
that
time
they
were
five,
three,
and
two
years,
and
now
they
have
been
modified
by
statute
to
three,
two,
and
one...
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
a
problem
which
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
assume
that...
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
assume
what
judge
marshall
felt,
but
i
assume
that
his
feeling
was
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
allow
the
individuals
to
replead
because
in
fact
they
had
already
started
serving
their
time,
that
is,
the
mandatory
parole.
if
they
were
allowed
to
replead,
the
state
could
then
prosecute
them
all
over
again,
and
who
knows--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--well,
the
seventh
circuit
didn't
allow
that
type
of
relief
in
baker
versus
finkbeiner,
which
was
the
first
case,
and
judge
marshall
was
obviously
applying
the
baker
case
to
these
particular
facts.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
judge
marshall
has
before
him
a
class
action
involving
the
same
issue.
he
has
certified
the
class
already.
i
assume
that
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
this
case
were
moot,
and
from
our
particular
standpoint,
of
course,
the
decision
would
be
vacated
and
we
would
technically
win,
nevertheless
judge
marshall
will
probably
go
ahead
and
still
make
the
same
ruling
with
regard
to
the
class,
and
we
would
be
back...
well,
we
may
not
be
back
here--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--but
we
would
be
back
arguing
the
case
once
again.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
understand.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
understand
that.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
yes,
justice
white?
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
where
were
they
at
the
time?
at
the
time
that
they
initially
filed
their
petitions,
they
were
incarcerated
at...
i
believe
both
of
then
were
at
stateville.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
their
initial
petitions
were
filed
in
1977,
and
this
case
has
been
up
and
down
to
the
seventh
circuit
twice.
today,
in
1981,
they
are
out
of
custody
of
the
department
of
corrections.
they...
as
far
as
i
know,
the
department
of
corrections
has
no
control
over
them.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
was
their
relief
denied?
no,
their
relief
was
granted
originally.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
initially
it
was
granted
in
january
of
1978.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
they
were.
one
of
them
was
not
actually
in
prison,
but
he
was
still
in
custody
because
he
was
serving
out
the
remainder
of
his
sentence
on
a
new
parole.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
yes.
in
the
first
case
williams
won,
when
we
went
to
the
seventh
circuit
the
first
time,
we
argued
the
substantive
issues,
but
we
also
argued
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
state
court
remedies.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
your
honor,
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
they
had
to
exhaust
state
remedies.
the
case
was
returned
to
judge
marshall.
judge
marshall
placed
it
on
what
he
called
his
past
case
calendar.
actually,
he
held
it
in
abeyance.
there
was
another
case
which
did
not
involve
these
petitioners
that
was
pending
before
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal,
which
is
the
same
as
petition
for
certiorari.
the
illinois
supreme
court
denied
that
petition.
judge
marshall
then
felt
that
taking
that
into--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--that
it
would
be
futile.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
we
did
not...
we
did
not
subsequently
re-raise
the
exhaustion
issue
when
we
went
back
to
the
seventh
circuit
for
two
reasons.
the
first
was
that
the
post-conviction
hearing
act,
which
is
our
belief
what
these
respondents
should
have
exhausted,
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
in
illinois
specifies
they
must
be
in
prison,
and
at
that
time
they
were
no
longer
in
prison.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
secondly,
there
was
and
still
is
another
case
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit,
norman
versus
scott,
in
which
the
exhaustion
once
again--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--for
these
particular
people,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
if
we
were
to
prevail?
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
if
we
were
to
prevail,
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
as
well
as
judge
marshall's
decision
that
the
mandatory
parole
term
admonishments
should
have
been
given,
and
that
there
was
a
constitutional
deprivation.
those
decisions
obviously--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--to
these...
to
these--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--if
we
prevail?
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
specifically
to
them
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
will
happen,
except
that
their
records
will
now
be
reflected...
their
records
that
are
with
the
department
of
corrections
shows
that
the
district
court
entered
a
writ
of...
granting
habeas
corpus
relief
and--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
no,
we
cannot.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
do
we
want
to?
well--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--the
individuals
were
both...
or
one
of
them
was
released
on
bail
pending
the
first
seventh
circuit
decision,
and
the
department
of
corrections
let
their
time
run
out.
they
then
subsequently
released
them.
they
would
not
have
revoked
them
had
they
done
something
else.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
will
be.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
again,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is
not
moot
because
of
the
possible
collateral
consequences
to
these
individuals
as
well
as
the--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--if
they
commit
crimes
in
the
future.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
that
is
my
point
exactly,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
the
conviction
of
the
crime
will
remain.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
the
records
show
at
the
present
time
that
the
district
court
entered
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
that
their
mandatory
parole
terms
could
not
continue
to
be
served,
and
if
in
fact
we
were
to
prevail,
that
would
be
expunged
from
the
records.
there
would
be
no
indication
that
they
ever
prevailed
at
all
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
no,
justice
marshal.
we
have
this
class--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--we
have
this
class
pending
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
issue
is
there.
we
have
a
case
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
we
are
talking
about...
we
are
talking
about
many,
many
prisoners
who
were
involved
from
january
1st
of
1973
until
may...
i
think
it
was
may
19th
of
1975,
who
were
subject
to
the
admonishments
of
the
mandatory
parole
and
may
not
have
received
those
admonishments.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
justice
white,
i
believe
you
are
correct.
i
believe--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--i
believe
you
are
correct
that
in
any
case
that
the
plea
was
invalid,
but
that
the--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--but
that
the
relief--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
and
have
a
new
trial.
the
key
is
that
the
relief...
the
relief
that
was
granted
was
simply
the
expungement
of
the
parole
term.
it
was
not--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
absolutely,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
the
potential
sentence,
both
of
the
individuals
plead
guilty
to
the
crime
of
burglary.
at
that
time
burglary
carried
a
potential
sentence
of
anywhere
from
one
to
20
years
incarceration.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
hesitate
to
go
that
far,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
as
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
while
the
relief
that
was
ordered
was
that
they
would
expunge
the
mandatory
parole
term,
the
rationale
is
that
the
underlying
plea
was
invalid
because
they
had
never
been
admonished--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--i
don't
believe
he
actually
entered
that
judgment.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
suspect
that
the--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--i
suspect
that
they
probably
wouldn't
have,
because
both
of
these
petitions
were
filed
just
after
the
seventh
circuit
decided
the
baker
versus
finkbeiner
case.
in
fact,
one
of
the
petitions
quite
frankly
refers
right
to
that
baker
case,
and
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
they
saw
the
baker
case
and
they
said,
aha,
we
are
home
free.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
they
simply
felt
that
they
were
home
free,
they
would
be
out
right
then
and
there.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
that
is
possible.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
unfortunately--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--unfortunately,
that
is
the
rationale
that
judge
marshall
used.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
judge
marshall
was
relying
upon
the
baker
disposition.
i
believe
baker
was
relying,
perchance,
on
the
santobello
disposition.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
baker
did
not
come
here.
the
companion
case,
ferris,
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
that
was
denied
by
this
court.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
that
is
our
belief.
that
is
not
present
in
this
case.
in
timmreck,
the
solicitor
general's
office
stated
the
question
as
being
whether
a
defendant
may
obtain
collateral
relief
from
his
conviction
under
section
2255
solely
because
the
district
court
violated
rule
11
in
accepting
his
guilty
plea.
we
submit
that
if
one
substitutes
section
2254
for
2255,
and
illinois
supreme
court
rule
402
for
rule
11,
our
case
raises
the
same
issue.
we
believe
that
timmreck
held
that
the
failure
to
admonish
as
to
a
mandatory
parole
term,
in
timmreck's
case
the
mandatory
special
parole
term,
merely
constitutes
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
formal
requirements
of
a
rule
governing
the
entry
of
guilty
pleas,
and
does
not
constitute
a
constitutional
defect
so
as
to
give
rise
to
habeas
corpus
relief.
indeed,
habeas
corpus
relief
should
not
be
allowed
to
do
service
for
an
appeal.
in
this
particular
case,
neither
of
the
petitioners
ever
took
a
direct
appeal,
nor
did
they
file
an
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act.
indeed,
they
have
not
filed
any
type
of
petition,
sought
any
type
of
appeal
in
the
illinois
courts.
we
believe
the
cases
are
similar
in
that
both
this
case
and
timmreck
involved
a
plea
bargain.
neither
in
timmreck
nor
here
was
a
direct
appeal
taken.
indeed,
as
we
indicated,
this
issue
was
not
raised
at
all
until
after
the
baker
decision
of...
in
response
to
that
decision
making
the
rounds
of
stateville.
and
most
importantly,
neither
respondent
has
ever
alleged
or
argued
that
he
would
not
have
plead
guilty
had
he
known
of
the
mandatory
parole
term.
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
people
versus
wills
decision
found
that
the
mandatory
parole
term
admonishment
is
required
under
supreme
court
rule
402.
however,
it
also
found
that
the
failure
to
admonish,
while
error,
is
not
of
constitutional
significance.
it
is
simply
one
factor
to
be
taken
into
account
when
determining
whether
or
not
the
plea
was
voluntary.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
excuse
me.
i
don't--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--well,
i
don't
know
for
sure
under
the
illinois
rules,
but
as
i
have
stated
under
the
illinois
rules,
the
court
will
take...
will
look
at
each
case
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
failure
to
admonish
was
of
sufficient
importance
as
to
indicate
that
the
plea
itself
was
not
knowing
and
voluntary.
we
believe
that
the...
by
the
way,
the
wills
decision
is
not
specifically
applicable
to
these
cases
because
wills
was
decided
in
may
of
1975.
both
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
were...
plead
guilty
in
march
of
1975,
and
wills
was
specifically
made
prospective
only.
indeed,
at
the
time
that
these
individuals
plead
guilty,
there
existed
in
illinois
a
decision
entitled
people
versus
krantz,
which
had
been
decided
approximately
ten
months
prior
to
wills,
and
in
the
krantz
opinion,
the
illinois
supreme
court
indicta
indicated
that
no
admonishment
as
to
the
mandatory
parole
term
was
required
at
all.
the
wills
decision
overrules
krantz
to
that
extent.
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
inquiry
on
collateral
attack
is
not
whether
an
error
of
law
occurred,
but
rather
whether
the
resulting
conviction
violated
due
process.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
it
did
not.
we
believe
that
the
mandatory
parole
term
is
not
a
direct
consequence
of
the
plea,
since
reincarceration
comes
into
play
only
if
a
defendant
violates
the
terms
of
parole.
as
judge
tone
noted
in
the
bachner
case,
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
bachner
versus
united
states...
here
we
are...
"the
failure
to
advise
a
defendant
of
the
mandatory
parole
term
does
not
inherently
result
in
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice.
"
"unlike
ineligibility
for
parole,
the
mandatory
parole
term
has
no
effect
on
the
period
of
incarceration,
and
does
not
ever
become
material
unless
the
defendant
violates
the
conditions
of
his
parole.
"
"it
would
be
as
unrealistic,
we
think,
to
assume
that
he
would
expect
to
do
so
and
be
influenced
by
that
expectation
at
the
time
he
is
considering
whether
to
plead

that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
it
does
not
bind
this
court,
but
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
felt
it
was
not
moot.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
do
not
believe
it
is
any
more
moot
now
than
it
was
then.
in
conclusion--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
--people
versus
wills,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
the
wills
decision
is
at
330
northeast
second
505,
61
illinois
second
105,
may
19th,
1975.
i
believe
we
have
cited
it
in
our
brief.
i
am
sure
we
have.
in
conclusion,
we
believe
that
if
the
federal
courts
are
not
to
grant
section
2255
relief
due
to
a
failure
to
admonish
as
to
the
mandatory
special
parole
term,
since
the
error
is
2254
relief
against
a
state
court
prisoner
for
the
very
same
problem.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
very
shortly,
your
honor.
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
comment
that
the
illinois
courts
are
not
bound
by
the
seventh
circuit
decisions,
that
is
correct.
they
are
not
bound
by
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
they
are
only
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
u.
s.
supreme
court.
however,
we
have
a
practical
problem.
if
the
seventh
circuit
is
going
to
hold
that
mandatory
parole
term
admonishments
must
be
given
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
illinois
courts
consistently
say,
no,
you
are
out
of
the
ball
park,
each
petitioner
is
simply
going
to
file
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition,
and
presumably
he
will
win
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
because
the
northern
district
of
illinois
is
required
to
follow
the
seventh
circuit.
ms.
mills
has
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
bargain
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
and
we
don't
see
a
bargain
having
been
involved.
we
don't
see
the
prosecutor
having
made
any
kind
of
promise
or
agreement
that
would
be
part
of
the
inducement
or
consideration,
in
the
language
of
santobello.
the
mandatory
parole
term
in
illinois
attached
automatically
to
every
sentence
involving
incarceration,
every
felony
sentence
involving
incarceration,
whether
these
individuals
had
received
a
one-year
sentence
or
a
20-year
sentence.
there
was
nothing
the
prosecutor
could
have
done.
there
was
nothing
the
judge
could
have
done.
it
was
going
to
be
in
there,
no
matter
what.
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
public
defender
had
a
duty
to
inform
his
client
and
that
type
of
questioning,
it
is
quite
possible
he
did,
but
keep
in
mind
that
at
the
time
that
these
pleas
were
entered,
this
krantz
decision
was...
appeared
to
be
the
law
in
illinois,
and
presuming
that
the
individuals
were
aware
of
the
krantz
decision,
and
i
am
sure
that
they
were,
they
could
only
have
read
into
that
decision
that
in
fact
no
admonishment
need
be
given
at
all.
krantz
subsequently
was
overturned,
at
least
in
that
portion,
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
but
we
can't
really
fault
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel
and,
for
that
matter,
the
judge
for
not
giving
the
mandatory
parole
term
admonishment
when
illinois
law
appeared
to
say
you
didn't
have
to
give
it.
unless
there
is
anything
further,
i
thank
you
very
much.
