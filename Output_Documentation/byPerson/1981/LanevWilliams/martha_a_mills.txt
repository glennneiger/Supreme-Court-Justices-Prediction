ms.
martha
a.
mills
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
talking
about
a...
just
one
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
fairness
of
a
negotiated
plea
agreement
where
one
of
the
sides
to
the
agreement
did
not
live
up
to
its
bargain.
the
timmreck
case,
i
think,
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
at
all.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
not
the
same
kind
of
plea
bargain,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
plea
bargain,
the
bargain
in
that
case
was
kept.
timmreck
plead
guilty
to
one
charge,
with
an
agreement
with
the
prosecutor
to
drop
certain
other
charges.
there
was
no
agreement
with
the
court
at
all.
the
charges
were
dropped
that
the
prosecutor
agreed
to
drop.
so
in
that
sense
his
plea
agreement
was
kept.
the
court
was
not
a
party
to
that
agreement.
the
court
merely
informed
him
of
the
sentence,
later
sentenced
him
to
a
term
which
included
mandatory
parole,
which
he
had
not
told
him
about,
but
that
was
not
highly
relevant
in
his
case
as
the
maximum
sentence
he
got
was
well
within
the
range
that
he
was
informed
in
the
first
place,
i.e.,
15
years.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
no,
sir.
there
is
no
such
allegation.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
i
think
that
might
change
the
situation,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
in
this
case,
both--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--pardon?
ms.
martha
a.
mills
in
a
sense,
mr.
justice,
it
is
a
practical
question.
these
two
petitioners
came
in
pro
se.
i
was
appointed
to
represent
them
by
judge
marshall
at
a
time
at
which
he
had
already
rendered
an
opinion
in
the
petitioners'
favor.
and
therefore
there
was
no
necessity
at
that
time
to
amend
or
supplement
the
petitions.
should
the
case
be
remanded
on
that
sole
point,
presumably
i
could
go
talk
to
these
people
and
ask
them,
can
you
make
that
kind
of
a
representation.
so
i
think
it
is
a
practical
pleading
problem,
really.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
i
think
they
had
public
defenders.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
public
defenders.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
the
record
below...
well,
i
am
trying
to
remember.
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
the
first
petition.
i
believe
they--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--no,
i
think
that
would
put
it
in
a
timmreck
class
where
it
is
more
of
a
technical
violation.
here
they
don't
know.
if
i
recall,
and
i
hesitate
to
say
this
because
i
don't
want
to
misrepresent
anything
to
the
court,
and
i
mixed
up
the
four
petitioners
we
had
originally...
there
are
affidavits
from
both
counsel
and
judge,
i
believe,
saying
that
this
was
a
negotiated
plea
agreement
that
they
all
entered
into,
and
looking
at
the
record,
and
there
was
no
mention
of
mandatory
parole
here.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
that
is
not
in
the
record.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
mr.
williams
found
out
two
months
before
he
was
released,
when
the
parole
board
gave
him
the
terms
of
his
release,
and
mr.
southall
said
that...
he
didn't
say
what
date
he
found
out,
but
he
did
say
he
found
out
after
the
date
to
appeal
had
expired.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
i
agree.
at
any
rate,
in
timmreck--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--their
attorneys
may
have
known,
but
according
to
their
own
statements
in
the
petition,
they
did
not
know.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
in
timmreck--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--yes,
sir.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
i
assume
the
public
defender
had
a
duty,
the
judge
had
a
duty,
and
the
prosecutor
had
a
duty,
and
obviously
this
is
a
case
in
which
nobody
did
it.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
in
timmreck,
when
timmreck
was
sentenced,
he
was
told
that
there
would
be
a
provision
of
mandatory
parole
attached
to
his
incarceration.
he
did
not
say
anything
at
that
time
about
that.
he
did
not
appeal.
he
sat
on
his
rights.
that
was
not
true
in
this
case.
these
defendants,
petitioners,
habeas
petitioners,
did
not
know
until
long
after
their
pleas,
plea
changes,
long
after
the
time
to
appeal
had
gone,
that
there
would
be
a
provision
of
mandatory
parole,
and
they
did
not
sit
on
their
rights,
and
that
therefore
changes
or
makes
less
compelling
the
good
policy
that
one
would
prefer
errors
to
come
by
direct
appeal
rather
than
belatedly
by
habeas
corpus.
collateral
attack
is
these
petitioners'
only
remedy.
the
state
argues
that
this
is
a
technical,
procedural
sort
of
defect.
it
very
definitely
is
not.
in
the
case
of
mr.
williams,
he
agreed
to
change
his
plea
from
not
guilty
to
guilty.
he
agreed
to
waive
his
panoply
of
rights
in
connection
with
the
criminal
trial
in
exchange
for
an
agreement
entered
into
by
himself,
the
prosecutor,
and
the
court
of
a
sentence
of
one
to
two
years.
the
court--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--that
is
an
issue
that
we
did
not
directly
confront
at
any
stage
in
these
many
cases.
judge
marshall,
of
course,
was
following
the
baker
decision.
baker
relied
in
part
on
santobello.
it
was
thought
that
since
these
people
had
served
all
or
portions
of
their
sentence,
that
it
would
not
be
an
appropriate
form
of
relief
to
actually
set
aside
the
conviction,
because
they
had
performed
their
part
of
the
bargain
they
made
with
the
state.
it
was
the
state
that
had
not
performed
its,
and
therefore
the
appropriate
relief
was
to
strike
the
mandatory
parole
so
that
the
state
would
then
have
been
compelled
to
perform
its
part
of
the
bargain
for
plea
agreements.
in
mr.
williams'
case,
when
he
agreed
to
one
to
two
years,
he
actually
was
in
custody
either
by
incarceration
or
parole
for
three
years
and
four
months.
in
the
case
of
mr.
southall,
who
had
agreed
to
one
to
three
years,
he
was
actually
in
the
custody
of
the
state
of
illinois
for
four
years
and
seven
months.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
the
only
thing
that
will
happen
to
my
clients
is
that
the
mandatory
parole
term
in
the
record
of
violations
and
revocations
that
occurred
during
that
term
which--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--they
shouldn't
have
had--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--yes.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
i
don't
believe
so.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
no.
they
didn't
ask
for
that,
and
that
was
not
the
relief
that
was
given.
the
relief
was--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--the
relief
was
solely
to
make
the
state
enforce
their
portion
of
the
bargain
that
these
defendants
had
made,
and
the
effect
that
their
record
will
have
will
only
be
apparent
if
they
are
engaged
in
some
other
criminal
activity
and
it
might
enhance
their
sentence
or
the
way
the
parole
board
treats
them,
or
something
like
that.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
the
plea
was
an
invalid
plea
because
it
was
not
voluntarily
entered
into,
but
i
don't
think
it
follows
that
the
relief
has
to
be
going
back
to
the
beginning
and
letting
them
re-enter
the
whole
new
plea,
because
in
this
case
they
have
made
an
agreement,
they
have
lived
up
to
it,
they
have
served
the
time.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that
when
you
are
at
a
point
where
they
have
served
the
entire
sentence
they
agreed
to
serve.
they
have
done
it.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
yes.
you
would
set
aside
the
entire
portion
of
mandatory
parole
so
that
if--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--i
think
that
has
other
constitutional
problems.
we
have
not
directly
addressed
that
before,
but
i
don't
think--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--no,
sir.
you
are
only
being
asked
to
affirm
the
seventh
circuit
judgment,
which
i
would
ask
you
to
affirm
or
to
dismiss
this
writ
as
improvidently
granted.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
i
think
that
is
a
wonderful
subject
for
a
law
review
article,
but
i
doubt
it
would
get
very
far
in
court.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
many
claims
are
made
these
days
that
are
surprising.
ms.
martha
a.
mills
going
back
to
the
state's
argument
that
this
is
just
a
technical
error,
the
illinois
courts,
while
paying
lip
service
to
the
mccoy
case,
or
to
the
baker
case
in
their
mccoy
opinion
have
never
enforced
the
baker
case,
and
have
refused
consistently
to
allow
any
kind
of
relief
either
by
appeal
or
any
of
the
post-conviction
statutes
for
people
whose
negotiated
guilty
pleas
fell
within
the
one
period
of
time
from
january,
1973--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--the
illinois
courts
are
bound
to
follow
federal
constitutional
constructions,
which
i
think
baker
is,
and
they
have
consistently
refused
to
follow
that,
and
i
could
refer
this
court--
ms.
martha
a.
mills
--it
may
be
a
case
of
the
seventh
circuit,
but
this
is
not
new
law,
that
guilty
pleas
must
be
voluntary
and
only
made
with
full
knowledge
of
the
consequences.
it
goes
back
to
kercheval
and
many
cases
in
between
through
boykin
and
bradey
and
santobello
and
others.
it
is
not...
the
baker
decision
did
not
announce
a
brand
new
and
surprising
rule
of
law,
and
i
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
making
their
decision
in
mccoy
wilfully
ignored
both
baker
and
the
prior
law
on
which
it
was
based
when
they
were
presented,
as
mr.
weinstein
said,
with
an
identical
case.
at
the
invitation
of
the
seventh
circuit
from
the
first
williams
opinion,
it
said,
we
think
the
language
in
mccoy
indicates
that
the
supreme
court
in
understanding
comity
in
federalism
has
decided
that
baker
is
good
law.
we
invite
you
to
solve
these
problems,
so
we
are
not
fighting,
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
refused
to
take
the
case
directly
on
point
with
the
williams
language
and
with
the
invitation
from
the
seventh
circuit.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
comity,
comity
is
a
two-way
street,
and
i
think
in
this
case
it
is
illinois
that
has
not
gone
along
the
route
of
comity
and
the
federal
courts
have
been
more
than
generous
in
giving
then
guidance,
both
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
from
old
supreme
court
decisions.
again,
we
are
not
talking
about...
well,
i
won't
address
myself
to
that.
thank
you
very
much.
