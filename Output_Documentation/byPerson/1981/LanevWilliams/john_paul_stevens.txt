justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce
is
lane
against
williams
and
southall,
it's
a
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
when
a
state
law
provides
for
a
mandatory
parole
term
at
the
end
of
a
prisoner's
period
of
incarceration.
and
when
the
trial
judge
accepts
a
plea
of
guilty
without
informing
the
defendant
that
that
is
a
part
of
the
sentence
that
will
be
imposed,
that
is
the
mandatory
parole
term,
has
there
been
a
violation
of
due
process
for
which
the
prisoner
may
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief.
after
studying
the
case,
we've
concluded
that
we
may
not
reach
the
issue
because
the
case
has
become
moot.
because
in
such
a
situation,
even
if
one
assumes
that
a
violation
of
due
process
occurs,
the
prisoner
has
two
different
forms
of
relief
which
he
might
seek.
on
the
one
hand,
they
might
seek
to
set
aside
his
conviction
on
the
guilty
plea
or
alternatively
he
might
seek
to
strike
from
sentence
that
portion
which
was
allegedly
unconstitutional
namely
the
parole
term.
in
this
case,
the
two
prisoners
chose
the
latter
form
of
relief.
they
did
not
seek
to
attack
the
basic
conviction.
they
merely
sought
to
set
aside
the
mandatory
parole
term
and
they
did
that
after
they
had
been
found
guilty
of
parole
violations
and
had
the
--
when
it
became
important
to
them
that
the
parole
term
be
set
aside.
but
by
the
time
the
case
was
decided,
they
had
already
served
the
full
period
of
incarceration
resulting
from
their
parole
violations
and
therefore
there's
not
remaining
life
controversy
before
the
court
as
we
analyzed
the
issues
that
the
mere
fact
that
their
records
contained
a
parole
violation
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
habeas
corpus
relief.
and
therefore,
we
have
directed
the
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
the
proceedings
as
having
become
moot.
in
this
case,
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
