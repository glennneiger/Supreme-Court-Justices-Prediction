unknown
speaker
it
was
also
challenged
on
the
grounds
that
it
prohibited
expenditures
by
individual
candidates
of
their
own
money,
and
it
was
struck
down
in
that
regard,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
i
gather
back
in
1976...
am
i
right...
the
commission
suggested
that
these
were
really
independent
expenditures
that
probably
wouldn't
come
within
to
further
the
election
of
candidates.
is
that
so
in,
you
know,
the
case
of
that
gop
feminist
caucus
on
the
buttons
for
president
ford?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
commission...
may
i
put
it
this
way...
interpreted
subdivision
(f)
as
inapplicable
if
they
are
in
fact
independent
expenditures?
unknown
speaker
has
not.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
your
answer
to
me
is
the
commission
never
has
in
fact
constituted
the
statute
as
inapplicable
to
so-called
independent
expenditures
by
these--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
your
position
today,
that
the
statute
can't
be
read
that
way.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
the
commission's
position
is
that
we
can't
avoid
deciding
the
constitutional
question.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
what
about
a
committee
that
was
formed,
an
independent
committee
that
was
formed
not
to
support
any
candidate,
but
in
a
three-way
political
campaign,
three
candidates,
three
major
candidates.
this
committee
devoted
itself
entirely
to
being
against,
to
the
defeat
of
one
of
them
in
circumstances
where
taking
votes
away
from
that
one
could
clearly
favor
one
of
the
other
two.
unknown
speaker
what
about
that
kind
of
a
committee?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
think
that's
any
interference
with
first
amendment
rights?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
only
the
commission
may
bring
an
action
under
9011(b)
to
implement
or
construe
the
act
before
a
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
which
might
involve
fact-finding
in
that
certainly.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
a
variation
of
the
hypothetical
i
had
put
to
you
earlier.
suppose
a
committee,
an
independent
committee
is
formed
for
the
stated
and
publicized
purpose
of
getting
out
the
largest
possible,
maximum
vote,
and
it
is
clear
in
that
setting
that
the
maximum,
the
larger
the
vote,
the
large
vote
will
favor
one
of
the
candidates.
would
you
say
that
that
would
fall
in
the
same
way
that
a
committee
formed
to
defeat
one
candidate
because
it
has
an
influence
on
the
election?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cox,
what
do
you
do
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals
treatment
of
your
standing
at
pages
28a
and
page
29a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
arguing
basically
the
same
position
as
the
commission
has
argued.
unknown
speaker
those
two
rights
you
referred
to,
mr.
cox,
they
come
about
as
near,
as
near
to
being
absolute
as
any
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
the
house
itself
has
not
accepted
or
has
not
enacted
legislation
which
provides
for
public
financing
of
house
of
representatives
campaigns,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
danger
from
donation
of
services
as
such?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
donation...
the
danger
from
donations
of
services
as
such?
unknown
speaker
how
about
just--
unknown
speaker
--well,
how
about
someone
who
takes
off
six
months
from
his
job
and
simply
canvasses
the
country
without
compensation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cox,
your
position
does
require
some
method
of
distinguishing
between
these
expenditures,
which
you
say
may
be
limited,
and
the
kinds
of
expenditures
that
the
court
said
could
not
be
limited
in
buckley,
namely
independent
expenditures
by
an
individual.
unknown
speaker
and,
or
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
ten
people
get
together
and
pool
their
resources
and
make
an...
and
all
agree
to
publish
a
certain
series
of
ads,
you
wouldn't
think
this
(f)
would
apply
to
that,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
something.
i
suppose
that
if
a
committee
like
this
rather
than
directly
supporting
a
candidate
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
issues
without
mentioning
a
candidate,
that
this
section
wouldn't
reach
that?
unknown
speaker
although
it
certainly
may
have
a
large
impact
on
the
election.
unknown
speaker
well,
an
issue-oriented
organization
only
for
purposes
of
this
election.
it
was
formed
in
connection
with
an
election,
and
it
disbands
when
the
election
is
over.
but
its
sole...
all
it
does
is
advocate
an
issue
or
several
issues.
unknown
speaker
even,
mr.
cox,
if
the
issue
is
one
supported
by
one
candidate
and
opposed
by
the
other,
so
that
the
expenditures
by
the
pro-issue
people
would
benefit
one
candidate
and
not
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
issue
committee
is
then,
if
it's
a
sole
issue,
is
that
committee
then
a
political
committee
for
purposes
of--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
you,
would
you
accept
or
would
you
object
to
a
construction
of
(f)
that
would
limit...
that
would
bar
only
those
expenditures,
to
those
expenditures
for
communications
that
include
explicit
words
of
advocacy
of
election
or
defeat
of
a
candidate?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
think
it
would
cover
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
reach
pretty
far
into
issue-oriented
organizations
as
long
as
they
said
to
themselves
the
way
to
win
this
election
is
to--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
way
you
put
that
would...
i'm
not
sure
that's
very
much
different
from
this
limitation
that
i
am
suggesting
to
you.
unknown
speaker
the
'71
act
simply
required
the
approval
of
the
candidate
for
any
media
expense,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
what's
your
suggestion
as
to
the
type
of
expenditures
that
section
(f)
does
reach?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said...
i
don't
know...
what
are
those?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
a
while
ago,
you
said
coordinated
expenditures
by
an
unauthorized
committee.
unknown
speaker
but
this
would
be
an
authorized
expenditure
by
an
unauthorized
committee.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baran,
was
this
argument
made
in
the
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
and
what
happened
to
it?
unknown
speaker
like
the
election
commission
does,
did
this
morning
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be,
but
they
say
that
your
expenditures
are
reached
by
it
anyway.
that's
pretty
clear.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand;
that
much
is
clear.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
i
take
it
you
think
there
is
no
question
that
you
can
present
this
issue
here.
you
didn't
cross
appeal,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
and
your
argument
was
rejected
below.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
if
you
won
on
the
statutory
around
you
wouldn't
be
expanding
your
relief
then.
it's
just
that
the
act
couldn't
prevent
these
expenditures.
unknown
speaker
justice
blackmun
asked
what
a
compelling
interest
was.
what
do
you
think
it
is?
do
you
think
it's
more
than
just
an
interest
that
is
important
enough
to
outweigh
any
interests
on
the
other
side?
in
that
sense
it
would
be
compelling,
in
the
sense
that
it
outweighs
other
interests?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
just
a
balance.
unknown
speaker
it
means
no
more
than
a
balance.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
really
a
substitute
for
any
analysis,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
really
just
a
substitute
for
any
analysis,
to
say
that
it
meets
or
it
doesn't
meet
a
compelling
interest.
it's
really
the
bottom
line
of
the
decision
of
the
court,
because
it
will
be
affirmed
or
reversed
depending
on
how
the
balance
comes
out.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
really
all
it
means
is
that
you're
looking
for...
and
all
you're
submitting
is
that
the
interests
on
the
public
side
or
in
favor
of
the
statute
are
insufficient
to
justify
the
restriction.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
the
candidate
would
know
of
that
report
and
probably
accord
an
audience,
if
he
would
accord
an
audience
to
someone
who
contributed
directly?
unknown
speaker
am
i
in
error?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
the
argument
on
the
other
side
was
that
money
was
given
as
a
result
of
a
promise,
but
that
once
the
money
was
given
there
was
a
collection
time
afterwards.
isn't
that
their
argument?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
address
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
didn't
say
that.
the
money
is
given
just
the
way
you
say,
and
then
afterwards
they
go
by
and
say
remember
me,
i'm
the
one
that
gave
you
a
million
dollars
with
no
strings
attached
to
it;
and
in
the
second
breath
he
says,
"but
i'd
like
a
job".
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
probably
doesn't
happen.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
problem
that
people
give
money
in
the
hope
of
getting
something
for
it.
that's
not
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
the
question
come
down
to
whether
there
is
evidence
of
some
such
situation
in
order
to
have
that
spill
over
on
evaluating
whether
the
committee
was
truly
independent
or
not?
isn't
that
an
evidentiary
question?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
was
you
wouldn't
have
to
prove
all
these
things.
i
thought
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
act.
because
if
you
gave
money
and
expected
a
return,
and
you
were
promised
a
return,
wouldn't
you
violate
more
laws
than
this
one?
wouldn't
you
violate
laws
long
before
this
one?
unknown
speaker
so
this
law
was
passed
to
get
to
other
ways
of
getting
to
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
first
amendment
right
to
buy
a
job.
unknown
speaker
i'm
glad
we
agree
on
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baran,
do
you
agree
with
what
i
understand
to
be
the
distinction
drawn
by
counsel
for
appellants
between
single
issue
groups
and
political
committees
as
defined
in
the
act?
in
other
words,
may
single
issue
groups,
which
now
are
quite
abundant
in
our
country,
can
they
be
distinguished
from
political
committees
as
a
practical
matter?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
agree
that
if
there
were
no
question
that
an
organization
was
an
issue
organization,
do
you
agree
that
section
(f)
does
not
reach
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
mr.
baran,
there
are
clearly
some
single
issue
groups
which
would
not
be
covered
because
maybe
both
candidates
take
the
same
position
as
that
group
does,
or
takes
a
contrary
position,
either
way.
if
you
had
say
an
organization
which
supported
membership
in
the
united
nations
or
whatever
it
might
and
both
candidates
agree
that
is
either
good
or
bad,
you
surely
wouldn't
call
that
a
political
committee.
unknown
speaker
there
really
isn't
any
danger
that
it
would
be
called
a
political
committee
under
the
statutory
language
either,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
if
i've
got
one
of
your
responses
clear.
i'm
not
clear
on
it.
a
group
of
people
identified
as
bipartisan,
both
democrats,
republicans
and
independents,
a
mixed
group,
get
together
an
organize
a
committee,
an
anti-salt
ii
treaty
committee.
and
you
say
that's
a
political
action
committee?
unknown
speaker
and
would
be
so
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
starting
with
a
conclusion.
let's
go
back
to
my
facts.
unknown
speaker
a
group
of
leaders
clearly
identified
as
activists
in
both
major
political
parties,
they're
all
of
one
mind
on
salt
ii,
either
for
it
or
against
it,
and
they
organize
a
committee.
make
this
one
an
anti-salt
ii
committee.
and
my
question
is,
is
that
a
political
committee
under
this
act?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
had
given
the
contrary
response
before
to
someone.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
may
have
misunderstood
you.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
would
say
that
if
that
very
committee
the
chief
justice
mentions,
if
that
very
committee
said
and
any
presidential
candidate
who
is
of
a
contrary
view
should
not
be
voted...
you
should
not
vote
for.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
they
don't
name
the
candidate,
but
it
may
be
that
the
two
candidates
differ
on
the
question.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
think
that
would
be
a
political
committee.
unknown
speaker
under
the
act.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
which
maybe
tells
us
something
about
the
ambiguities
of
the
statute
or
the
flaws
in
the
statute
rather
than
in
what
the
commission
has
tried
to
do.
one
doesn't
have
to
name
the
candidate
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
which
of
the
two
is
being
supported.
for
example,
in
the
salt
ii,
the
committee
would
simply
have
to
advocate
rejection
or
adoption
in
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states
and
never
mention
any
candidate,
but
the
record
of
one
or
the
other
would
tie
together.
i
haven't
read
any
of
the
rulings
in
this
respect
by
the
commission.
how
would
it
rule
on
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
i've
asked
the
wrong
counsel.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'll
reserve
the
question
for
mr.
steele.
unknown
speaker
can
the
kind
of
a
committee
that
you
represent,
may
the
kind
of
committee
you
represent
contribute
directly
to
the
campaign
of
a
candidate?
unknown
speaker
because--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
were
speaking
of
some
alternative,
less
restrictive
measures.
is
one
of
them
a
limitation
on
the
contribution
to
the
kind
of
a
committee
you
represent?
unknown
speaker
so
your
committee
can't
get
more
than
$5,000
from
any
one
person.
unknown
speaker
any
person.
unknown
speaker
i
have
one.
let
me
have
a
variation
of
the
hypothetical
i
gave
to
your
friend.
let's
suppose
a
group
of
people
form
a
foreign
policy
committee
against
camp
david
agreements.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
that's
identified
with
one
of
the
candidates,
and
it
may
be
ambiguous
as
to
the
others
who
may
or
may
not
have
declared
themselves.
in
your
view
would
the
act's,
the
provisions
of
the
act,
make
that
a
political
committee?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
quite
as
sharp
a
distinction
as
the
foreign
policy
committee
against
camp
david
agreements.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
commission,
hypothetically,
decided
to
proceed
on
that
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
willful
act,
would
you
not
have
very
grave
first
amendment
problems
with
respect
to
these
people
trying
to
express
their
views
about
a
foreign
policy
matter?
unknown
speaker
does
that
bring
you
up
against
some
possible
substantive
due
process
questions?
unknown
speaker
cross
petitions
that
rely
on
no
evidence
but
just
on
presumption,
statutory,
legislative
presumptions?
