mr.
jan
w.
baran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
your
indulgence
i
wish
to
discuss
for
just
a
couple
of
minutes
exactly
what
type
of
committees
are
before
you
and
the
activities
that
they
undertook
with
respect
to
the
1980
election.
appellee
committees...
americans
for
change,
fund
for
a
conservative
majority,
and
americans
for
an
effective
presidency...
are
voluntary
associations
supported
solely
through
voluntary,
statutorily-limited
contributions,
primarily
by
thousands
of
individuals
across
the
country.
they
have
been
duly
registered
with
the
federal
election
commission;
they
file
regular
reports
disclosing
all
of
their
receipts
and
all
their
disbursements.
in
1980
these
committees
solicited
and
accepted
the
voluntary
contributions
with
the
understanding
that
the
funds
would
be
used
to
purchase
communications
to
support
the
candidacy
of
the
republican
nominee
at
that
time,
former
governor
ronald
reagan.
the
sort
of
expression
that
was
purchased
by
these
committees
include
newspaper
advertisements,
radio
and
television
advertising,
letters,
flyers,
brochures,
even
bumper
strips
and
buttons.
some
of
these
samples
of
expression
undertaken
in
1980,
and
which
is
the
expression
that
is
challenged
by
the
appellants
in
this
case,
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
of
americans
for
change.
mr.
cox
referred
to
an
attempted
distinction
between
issue
discussion
and
candidate
discussion.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
appendix
a,
which
is
a
newspaper
advertisement
that
depicts
what
americans
for
change
believe
to
be
the
record
of
president
jimmy
carter
on
various
issues
concerning
jobs,
the
budget,
inflation,
and
with
the
record
of
ronald
reagan
when
he
was
governor
of
california.
i
don't
know
where
the
appellants
wish
to
draw
the
line
for
purposes
of
the
statute
that
is
at
issue
here,
but
certainly
that
same
advertisement
either
in
its
present
form
is
dealing
with
issue
discussion
of
those
issues
that
surrounded
the
campaign
in
1980,
or
perhaps
with
some
deletion
of
a
word
here
or
a
word
there
it
would
to
the
satisfaction
of
appellants.
with
respect
to
when
an
organization
becomes
a
political
committee
under
the
federal
election
campaign
act,
we
cite
to
several
advisory
opinions
that
have
been
issued
in
the
course
of
several
years
by
the
federal
election
commission
concerning
when
a
group
becomes
a
political
committee
for
purposes
of
not
only
the
federal
election
campaign
act
but
the
fund
act
as
well.
and
in
that
collection
of
opinions,
which
appears
on
pages
34
and
35
in
footnote
38...
this
is
the
brief
of
americans
for
change...
includes
a
loose
association...
that
is
the
commission's
phrase...
a
loose
association
that
in
1980
published
a
summary
of
positions
by
candidates
reagan,
carter
and
anderson
concerning
"key
moral
and
religious
liberty
issues.
"
and
that
organization
was
held
by
the
commission
to
be
a
political
committee.
the
types
of
advertising
and
communication
undertaken
by
these
committees
in
1980
were
done
so
without
the
cooperation
or
consultation
or
direction
or
control
of
ronald
reagan
or
his
campaign.
that
is
conceded
in
this
case
by
all
the
parties.
they
are
as
such
independent
expenditures,
which
is
not
only
a
statutorily-defined
term
contained
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act,
but
is
a
concept
that
was
very
clearly
recognized
by
this
court
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
and
referred
to
more
recently
in
the
california
medical
association
case.
these
are
expenditures
for
communications
that
expressly
advocate
the
election
or
defeat
of
a
clearly
identified
candidate
which
have
been
undertaken
by,
in
this
case,
committees
without
the
consultation,
direction,
or
control
of
the
candidate.
we
seek
affirmance
of
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
for
two
basic
reasons.
first,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
construction
which
is
not
only
proper
but
one
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
section
9012(f)
ten
years
ago,
which
would
not
make
that
statute
applicable
to
independent
expenditures.
in
the
alternative,
if
the
statute
is
construed,
as
suggested
by
the
appellants,
to
apply
to
independent
expenditures,
then
it
is
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
for
the
reasons
and
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
in
buckley
v.
valeo.
mr.
steele
indicated
that
the
federal
election
commission
had
not
come
forth
with
any
construction
as
to
what
constitutes
an
expenditure
to
further
the
election
of
a
candidate,
and
in
fact,
in
response
to
questions
from
the
court
was
hardly
precise
as
to
what
that
term
means.
expenditures
to
further
the
election
of
a
candidate
are
the
types
of
expenditures
that
are
limited
by
section
9012(f).
this
action,
which
is
brought
under
section
9011(b),
i
assume
seeks
to
implement
and
construe
this
section.
since
we
are
not
challenging
the
constitutionality
in
the
sense
of
having
brought
this
case
before
the
court
below,
we
were
sued.
the
appellants
are
the
ones
who
brought
this
suit
to
implement
and
construe
section
9012(f).
9012(f),
when
it
was
passed
ten
years
ago,
made
sense
as
a
limitation
on
coordinated
expenditures
by
unauthorized
committees.
it
may
not
make
a
great
deal
of
sense
today
because
in
the
intervening
ten
years
we
have
not
only
had
the
fund
act
passed,
but
also
the
federal
election
campaign
act
of
1971,
and
three
subsequent
major
amendments
to
both
those
acts,
plus
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
v.
valeo.
these
campaign
financing
statutes
have
gone
through
tremendous
readjustment,
upheaval,
repeal,
sections
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court;
and
the
way
they
exist
today
are
hardly
the
way
that
they
perhaps
were
originally
envisioned
back
in
1971,
and
certainly
would
not
be
advance
of
the
model
of
draftsmanship
and
clarity.
but
back
in
1971
there
were
no
limitations
on
contributions.
the
general
limitations
on
contributions
were
not
enacted
by
congress
until
1974.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
the
federal
election
campaign
act
of
1971,
which
is
a
separate
piece
of
legislation
from
the
fund
act
in
which
9012(f)
is
contained,
in
its
original
form
contained
a
limitation
on
all
candidates,
not
just
publicly
financed
candidates
but
privately
financed
candidates
for
president,
house
and
senate,
and
that
limitation
set
a
dollar
amount
as
to
what
expenditures
the
candidates
could
make
for
media
communications,
the
same
communications
that
these
committees
undertook
in
1980...
newspaper
ads,
television
and
radio
advertising.
and
in
addition
to
setting
the
limitation,
the
congress
placed
in
that
statute
in
title
1
a
certification
process,
all
of
which
is
described
in
considerable
detail
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
aclu
v.
jennings,
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
and
this
certification
process
required
any
individual,
group
or
committee
to
obtain
the
written
permission
of
the
candidate
before
they
would
be
able
to
purchase
advertising
from
a
broadcaster
or
from
a
magazine
or
publication.
so
ironically,
this
formula,
this
statute,
which
was
considered
by
the
senate
three
months
before
they
considered
section
9012(f)
and
the
fund
act,
if
it
had
been
able
to
pass
constitutional
muster
in
aclu
v.
jennings
and
had
continued
in
existence
in
this
original
form
up
to
the
1980
election,
these
committees
would
not
have
been
able
to
undertake
the
advertising
and
activity
that
they
did
without
having
first
gone
to
ronald
reagan
and
getting
his
permission,
because
the
broadcasters
would
have
denied
them
the
opportunity
to
purchase
that
type
of
advertising,
as
would
have
the
newspapers.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
it
was
not
the
fund
act
or
9012(f)
that
congress
chose
to
address
in
seeking
to
limit
independent
expression
in
campaigns.
through
the
history
of
campaign
financing
legislation
the
congress
has
consistently
utilized
the
federal
election
campaign
act
as
a
vehicle
by
which
they
in
various
forms
sought
to
limit
independent
expenditures.
the
first
such
effort
was
the
title
1
provision
that
i
have
just
described.
when
that
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
three-judge
court
in
aclu
v.
jennings,
in
1974
congress
enacted
another
limitation
of
$1,000
on
independent
expenditures,
and
that
limitation
was
section
608(e)
that
this
court
reviewed
in
buckley
v.
valeo
and
struck
down
as
unconstitutional.
after
that
decision,
the
congress
essentially
threw
up
its
hands
and
said
we
cannot
limit
the
genuinely
independent
activities
of
individuals
or
groups
or
committees
as
long
as
they
are
out
there
acting
on
their
own
and
not
under
the
direction
or
control
of
the
candidate.
and
since
that
time
we
have
had
no
further
attempts
by
congress
to
impose
this
type
of
a
limitation
in
any
other
form.
the
legislative
history
surrounding
both
the
title
1
provision
as
well
as
section
9012(f)
is
set
forth
in
great
detail
in
our
brief.
it
does
not
support
the
contention
of
appellants
that
congress
sought
to
specifically
limit
the
types
of
activities
that
these
committees
have
undertaken.
there
is
no
clarity
in
either
the
reports
of
the
congress
or
on
the
floor
debates
that
when
9012(f)
was
enacted,
congress
was
thinking
about
regulating
the
so-called
organized
committees
that
were
going
to
operate
independently
of
the
candidate.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
your
honor,
these
would
be
what
i
would
characterize
as
coordinated
expenditures.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
those
would
be
expenditures
that
have
been
made
at
the
direction
or
control
of
the
candidate
or
in
consultation
or
cooperation.
there
is
a
very
lengthy
provision
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct.
the
terminology
is
somewhat
confusing
and
arcane,
but
one
of
the
new
ingredients
in
the
campaign
financing
laws
introduced
in
1971
was
this
notion
of
an
authorized
committee.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
would
not
make
that
committee
an
authorized
committee.
the
statute
very
clearly
sets
forth
that
an
authorized
committee
is
only
that
committee
that
has
been
authorized
in
writing
by
the
candidate.
if
there
were
these
committees
operating,
and
they
were
doing
so
in
coordination
with
the
candidate,
then
perhaps
the
candidate
would
have
to
come
forth
and
authorize
them
formally.
it's
a
formal
process.
and
this
again
is
the
historical
context
in
which
congress
was
confronting
this
issue
of
campaign
financing
back
in
1971.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
the
court
rejected
it.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
your
honor,
they
did
this
morning,
and
they
have
implicitly
in
their
briefs,
but
they've
never
promulgated
a
rule
that
sets
forth
as
to
the
scope
of
section
9012(f).
they
have
been
unable
even
this
morning
to
tell
you
what's
an
expenditure
to
further
the
election.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
they
say
so,
your
honor.
we
dispute
that.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
yes.
we
wouldn't
he
here
if
they
didn't
say
that.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
the
history
surrounding
section
9012(f)
i
will
only
refer
to
briefly,
but
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court's
attention
that
senator
pastore,
who
is
the
author
of
not
only
9012(f)
but
the
fund
act,
when
confronted
with
questions
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
as
to
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
certain
committees
organized
by
what
he
calls
faculty
members
of
columbia
university
or
schoolteachers,
he
says,
you
know,
they're
operating
on
their
own,
they're
independent,
they're
able
to
do
whatever
they
want
to.
and
this
legislative
history,
in
our
opinion,
totally
repudiates
the
contention
of
the
appellants
that
congress
in
enacting
9012(f)
was
seeking
to
control
the
activities
of
genuinely
independent
organizations.
if
section
9012(f)
were
not
construed
as
a
limitation
on
coordinated
expenditures,
then
the
statute
becomes
unconstitutional
as
a
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights
of
expression
and
association.
like
section
608(e)
that
this
court
addressed
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
the
restrictions
contained
here
are
substantial,
direct
restrictions
on
both
the
quantity
and
the
quality
of
political
expression
as
undertaken
in
conjunction
with
our
campaigns.
both
appellants
this
morning
indicate
that
the
campaign
funding
act
is
important
because
the
candidate
has
made
a
decision
to
accept
this
public
funding,
and
therefore
the
expenditure
limitation
that
is
imposed
on
the
candidate.
this
court
recognized
in
buckley,
and
it
was
so
recognized
later
in
the
republican
national
committee
case,
that
the
overall
general
expenditure
limitation
that
is
voluntarily
assumed
by
the
candidate
who
makes
this
election
is
not
a
restriction
on
the
rights
of
the
candidate's
supporters
where
the
supporters
remain
free
to
undertake
their
own
independent
expression
on
behalf
of
that
candidate,
so
long
as
they
do
so
outside
of
his
campaign
or
outside
of
his
direction
or
control.
in
buckley
the
court
noted
that
a
$1,000
limitation
in
1975
was
insufficient
to
purchase
a
one-quarter
page
ad
in
the
washington
post
newspaper
here
in
washington.
that
figure
has
doubled
in
terms
of
advertising
rates
by
1979.
whatever
restriction
occurred
with
respect
to
the
quantity
of
speech
that
could
be
purchased
for
$1,000,
it
has
doubled,
more
than
doubled
in
the
intervening
years
since
buckley.
with
respect
to
the
quality
of
advocacy
that
can
be
undertaken
in
light
of
section
9012(f)
as
a
restriction
on
independent
expression,
the
type
of
limitation
that
would
exist
after
the
statute
were
construed
to
limit
organized
collective
political
independent
expression
would
mean
that
there
will
be
only
four
avenues
of
expression
in
conjunction
with
publicly
financed
campaigns.
those
avenues
would
be
the
campaign,
the
political
parties,
the
institutional
press,
and
wealthy
individuals.
it
is
conceded
that
if
senator
schmitt,
who
is
an
appellee
in
this
case,
were
a
rich
man
and
had
the
resources
to
go
out
and
purchase
exactly
the
same
advertising
that
these
committees
undertook
in
1980,
that
that
would
not
only
not
be
reached
by
section
9012(f),
but
that
action
on
the
part
of
the
individual
is
constitutionally
protected,
as
it
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
buckley
v.
valeo.
on
the
other
hand,
the
committees
have
attempted
to
gather
together
persons
of
like
mind
who
do
not
have
the
unlimited
resources
that
they
would
be
able
to
exercise
statutorily
and
constitutionally,
and
in
lieu
thereof
have
chosen
to
pool
their
resources
and
to
purchase
expression
and
to
utilize
professional
help
in
terms
of
formulating
their
message,
and
to
attempt
to
persuade
the
public
as
to
why
it
should
vote
for
ronald
reagan
in
1980.
and
that
is
the
core
of
the
expression
that
this
court
has
before
it
today.
there
is
no
question
that
the
wealthy
man
can
go
out
and
buy
the
same
advertising,
but
the
appellants
think
that
it
is
not
fair
and
constitutional
to
impose
a
limitation
on
these
groups
and
their
supporters.
the
interest
that
the
appellants
have
advanced
in
support
of
this
restriction
appears
to
be
two:
first
is
the
interest
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
public
financing
statute.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
and
as
i
just
referred
to,
we
don't
believe
that
is
the
interest
that
rises
to
the
area
of
being
compelling,
and
that
the
statute
first
of
all
was
never
contingent
on
an
overall
expenditure
limitation;
and
secondly,
the
only
reason
it
was
sustained
in
the
republican
national
committee
case
was
that
these
supporters
still
reserved
their
right
to
undertake
independent
expression.
the
other
interest
that
has
been
advanced
is
the
proper
interest
and
concern
of
congress
to
prevent
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
with
respect
to
candidates
after
they
become
public
office-holders.
this
court
noted
in
buckley
that
in
the
context
of
independent
expenditures,
there
is
not
the
opportunity
for
the
contributor
to
sit
down
with
the
candidate
or
his
representative
and
say
okay,
here's
$50,000
or
whatever
amount
of
money
you
wish
to
denote.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
up
to
the
moment
of
our
recess
i
was
addressing
section
9012(f)
of
the
fund
act,
having
previously
concluded
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
activities
of
the
appellee
committees.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes.
it
was
addressed
by
the
three-judge
court
and
rejected
for
the
reasons
stated
in
their
opinion,
which
in
our
brief
we
fully
articulated
were
not
valid.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct.
our
contention
is
that
the
activities
of
these
committees
in
1980
were
either
not
regulated,
or
if
there
was
an
attempt
at
regulation
would
be
unconstitutional.
in
either
sense
they
should
be
permitted
to
do
what
they
did.
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
interests,
which
mr.
cox
conceded
are
present
in
this
case
and
which
this
court
noted
in
buckley
and
in
the
california
medical
association
case,
are
deserving
of
the
highest
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
the
statute
can
be
sustained
only
if
it
serves
a
compelling
governmental
interest
which
is
narrowly
drawn
and
cannot
be
accomplished
through
less
restrictive
measures.
in
reviewing
a
similar
statute
in
buckley,
section
608(e),
which
has
been
referred
to
many
times
earlier
today,
this
court
concluded
that
the
one
compelling
interest
or
the
one
governmental
interest
that
was
advanced
in
that
case
was
not
served
by--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
be
compelling
in
the
sense
that
it
would
offset
the
first
amendment
values.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
it
is
a
balance.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
justice
white.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
government
does
not
have
a
valid
interest
in
preventing
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
in
the
political
process.
we
argue
that
just
as
in
the
buckley
case
this
limit
does
not
serve
that
interest,
and
that
there
are
numerous
other
measures
in
the
existing
statutes
of
the
campaign
financing
laws,
some
of
which
were
enacted
after
this
court's
decision
in
buckley,
which
more
constitutionally
and
more
effectively
address
the
interest
that
the
government
had
back
originally
in
'71
and
in
subsequent
years
to
prevent
the
corruption
in
campaign
financing.
the
interest
at
all
times
has
been
focused
on
contribution
limits.
senator
pastore
referred
to
it
as
the
situation
where
there
is
the
"intimate
contact"
between
the
contributor
and
the
candidate,
which
may
create
the
potential
for
undue
influence
or
some
sort
of
corrupt
quid
pro
quo.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
buckley,
when
one
refers
to
independent
expenditures
where
an
individual
or
a
group
is
undertaking
their
advocacy
outside
of
the
control
of
the
candidate,
such
an
environment
does
not
arise
in
the
sense
that
congress
was
focusing
on
it
when
it
was
passing
these
campaign
financing
laws.
the
interest
is
served
much
better
by
other
means
than
a
limit
on
the
expression
itself.
some
of
those
measures
which
have
been
noted
in
the
past
include
the
disclosure
provisions.
since
the
buckley
decision
not
only
have
there
been
the
continued
disclosure
provisions
requiring
the
disclosure
of
all
receipts
and
all
disbursements,
but
after
your
decision
the
congress
enacted
in
'76
a
further
requirement
that
independent
expenditures,
specifically
by
these
type
of
committees,
have
to
be
separately
reported.
and
the
federal
election
commission
has
promulgated
even
separate
forms
for
the
reporting
of
independent
expenditures.
and
on
top
of
that,
on
that
particular
form
the
treasurer
of
the
committee
has
to
swear
that
the
expenditure
was
in
fact
independent.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
we
do
not
dispute,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
candidate
may
be
aware
of
effective
advocacy
that
is
undertaken
on
his
behalf.
the
issue
that
we
believe
is
crucial
to
the
determination
of
the
presence
of
a
compelling
interest
is
whether
this
candidate
has
any
control
over
this
advocacy
in
the
sense
that
he
would
have
control
over
contributions
that
he
receives;
and
he
spends
those
contributions
the
way
he
and
his
campaign
managers
believe
ought
to
be
spent.
and
the
only
way
that
he
can
get
control
over
that
potentially
under
the
corruption
argument
is
by
making
some
sort
of
illicit
promise
in
return
for
the
availability
of
the
money.
but
under
these
circumstances
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
committees
in
their
conduct
in
1980
on
behalf
of
ronald
reagan
were
not
under
his
control.
they
were
expressing
their
views
which
are
representative
of
those
who
contributed--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--and
advocated
their
election.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
their
argument,
and--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes,
your
honor.
justice
marshall,
that
argument
is
persuasive
if,
as
you
say,
the
money
is
given,
if
the
money
is
handed
over
to
the
candidate.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
they
may
be
discussing
that
situation,
but
that
situation
has
been
addressed
through
contribution
limits,
and
we--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--our
position
is
that
the
money--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--that
it
is
not
a
problem,
it
is
not
the
type
of
situation--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
a
problem.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
present
in
this
case,
in
this
situation.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
your
honor.
it's
an
issue
that's
not
before
this
court
as
to
whether
these
committees
were
in
fact
independent.
they
were
sued.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
there
are
other
statutes,
as
bribery
and
graft
statutes,
yes.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
absolutely,
justice
marshall,
without
restricting
the
first
amendment
rights
of
expression
and
advocacy
and
association
that
are
clearly
present
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
and
that
is
not
our
contention
or
factual
issue
here.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
it
is
a
very
difficult
distinction
to
make
which,
as
mr.
steele
indicated
this
morning,
the
commission
grapples
with
those
issues
and
on
occasion
has
to
make
an
evaluation
as
to
whether
a
particular
organization
is
an
issue
organization
or
whether
it's
a
political
committee.
the
definitions
under
the
act...
and
i
might
say
that
there
are,
i
believe,
three
definitions
in
the
campaign
financing
laws...
one
in
the
campaign
act,
one
in
the
fund
act,
one
in
the
primary
act...
are
not
even
all
in
harmony.
they
all
say
something
a
little
differently,
mostly
because
they
were
all
passed
in
different
years.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
not
at
all,
your
honor.
in
the
absence
of
a
limited
construction
as
to
what
constitutes
an
expenditure
to
further
the
election
of
a
candidate,
it
clearly
would
encompass
certain
issue
advocacy.
if
these
committees
had
undertaken
their
advertising
campaigns
and
other
expression
in
1980
and
simply
said
we
think
the
salt
ii
is
a
terrible
idea
and
any
president
who
adopts
salt
ii
should
not
be
re-elected,
they
would
still
be
covered
by
9012(f).
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
wouldn't
call
that.
i--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--well,
your
honor,
i
cited
an
advisory
opinion
in
this
morning's
argument
issued
by
the
commission
that
addressed
the
question
of
a
loose
association
that
wanted
to
discuss
issues
on
religious
subjects,
and
how
the
different
candidates
stood
on
those
particular
issues.
and
in
1980
there
were
three
candidates
receiving
public
funding.
the
point
we
would
make
is
that
the
term
"further
the
election"
has
not
been
narrowly
construed
by
any
party
here
except
us,
and
our
construction
is
that
congress
was
searching
to
limit
coordinated
expenditure
activity.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--the
history
of
the
commission
in
its
construction
of
what
constitutes
a
committee
is
very
broad;
but
i
can
say
that
if
an
organization
were
to
make
identical
expenditures
regarding
salt
ii,
and
we
all
agree
that
they're
a
political
committee,
then
under
appellants'
argument--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--certainly.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
in
my
opinion
it
is
not.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
if
i
did,
i
apologize
for
misspeaking.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
would
suggest
at
the
same
time,
however,
that
the
discussion
of
these
type
of
issues,
number
one,
can
be
so
inextricably
combined
with
the
current
campaign
with
inevitable
references
to
candidates--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
think
if
there
is
that
advocacy
for
a
candidate--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--and
that--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
know
that
it--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
know
that
it
would
be
an
expenditure
to
further
the
election
of
somebody.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
and
it
might
be
a
political
committee.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
we
are
talking
about
two
terms
here
that
are
crucial
to
the
construction
of
the
statute--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--which
have
very
broad
implications.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
would
prefer,
justice
powell,
to
defer--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--to
the
representative
of
the
commission
who
i'm
sure
will
be--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--the
less
restrictive
measures,
in
addition
to
these
reporting
requirements
that
are
contained
in
the
act,
also
include
requirements
that
if
an
independent
committee
or
even
an
individual
undertook
their
independent
expenditure
in
the
form
of
advertising,
that
the
advertising
must
clearly
note
who
purchased
that
ad
and
the
fact
that
it
was
not
authorized
by
any
candidate.
and
there
is
a
provision
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act
that
says
categorically
that
these
committees
could
not
take
any
of
the
advertising
or
any
of
the
materials
produced
by
the
reagan
campaign
and
reproduce
them.
the
provision
of
the
act
says
that
that
is
a
per
se
contribution
and
is
no
longer
independent.
so
these
restrictions
which
are
contained
in
other
sections
of
the
campaign
act
certainly
are
efforts
on
the
part
of
congress
to
ensure
that
whatever
independent
advocacy
is
undertaken
is
in
fact
independent,
and
that
the
commission
will
monitor
those
efforts.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
no,
your
honor.
the
reagan
campaign
was
prohibited
by
law
from
accepting
any
contributions.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
because
the
candidate
made
a
voluntary
decision
to
accept
the
public
funding,
and
the
condition
of
that
acceptance
on
the
candidate
is
that
he
cannot
accept
any
more
contributions.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
prohibition
on
contributions
to
the
candidate,
the
committees
that
i
represent,
all
the
funds
they
raise
are
limited
by
the
statute.
in
fact,
they're
limited
by
the
provision
that
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
california
medical
association.
that
contribution
limit
is
the
one
that
is
imposed
on
the
supporters
of
these
committees.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
from
any
person.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
including
another
political
committee
if
one
were
to
decide
to
support
the
activities
of
appellees.
for
these
reasons,
your
honors,
we
seek
affirmance
of
the
unanimous
three-judge
court
decision
below.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'm
pleased
to
conclude
my
argument.
