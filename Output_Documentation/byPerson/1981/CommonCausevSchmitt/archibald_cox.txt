mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
in
this
case
have
extraordinary
importance,
not
only
because
they
implicate
the
first
amendment
but
also
because
the
decision
will
profoundly
influence,
if
not
determine
for
many
years
in
the
future
the
role
of
aggregated
wealth
from
presidential
elections.
the
central
question
as
we
see
it
here
is
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
restrict
the
aggregation
and
expenditure
of
wealth
by
political
committees,
by
organizations
whose
primary
purpose
is
to
support
a
candidate
for
election,
where
the
presidential
candidate
has
agreed
to
accept
public
funds
in
lieu
of
private
financing
of
his
campaign.
that
question,
we
submit,
was
not
decided
in
buckley
and
valeo.
that
case
was
concerned
with
a
sweeping
ban
on
all
independent
expenditures,
including
expenditures
by
individuals,
by
a
wide
variety
of
associations.
section
9012(f),
on
the
other
hand,
restricts
only
expenditures
by
political
committees;
that
is
to
say,
by
centrally
managed
organizations
whose
major
purpose
is
to
raise
money
by
widespread
solicitation
of
contributions,
and
then
having
aggregated
the
funds,
to
promote
the
election
of
a
candidate.
we
submit
the
restriction
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment
essentially
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
serves
the
important
purpose
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
government
and
public
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
government
against
the
corrosive
effects
of
private
financing
in
presidential
election
campaigns.
and
second,
it
leaves
wide
scope
for
political
speech
and
expression
by
individuals
and
by
groups,
including
various
associations
other
than
political
committees
as
i
have
defined
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
first
that
that
question
need
not
be
faced
by
this
court,
because
of
the
decision
in
mcculloch
against
the
society
of
honduran
seamen
in
372
u.s.
10.
there
the
court
had
two
cases
before
it.
in
one
of
them
the
plaintiffs'
standing
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
was
established.
in
the
other
case
it
was
debated,
as
it
would
be
debated
here.
and
this
court
held
in
the
mcculloch
case...
that
was
the
flags
of
convenience
case
that
some
of
you
will
remember...
that
it
could
go
to
the
merits
in
both
cases.
so
i
think
your
honors
do
not
need
to
be
concerned
with
that
question.
the
case,
we
submit,
of
course,
should
be
remanded;
and
we
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
issue
to
be
fought
out
again
in
the
district
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
of
course,
when
that
question
requires
decision...
and
we
have
covered
it
in
our
papers
on
the
jurisdictional
statement...
when
that
question
requires
consideration,
then
we
would
be
at
odds.
but
i
don't
think
this
court
has
decided.
if
the
court
does
go
into
it,
it's
covered
in
our
papers
in
the
answer
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm.
in
developing
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
i
acknowledge,
of
course,
that
the
restriction
in
9012(f)
impinges
on
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
association.
but
those
rights,
we
submit,
as
this
court
has
often
held,
are
not
absolute.
there
is
some
room
for
balancing
where
the
restriction
is
targeted
to
protect
the
public.
again,
this
faces
evil
other
than
some
evil
supposed
to
be
inherent
in
the
ideas
or
the
information
expressed
and
its
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
public.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
has
often
said
that
they
are
subject
to
qualification
if
we
satisfy
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
and
here
we
submit
that
we
do
satisfy
that
test.
the
fund
act,
as
i
said,
was
framed
and
enacted
to
secure
the
integrity
of
government
and
the
confidence
of
people
in
the
integrity
of
government.
and
this
court
on
previous
occasions
has
recognized
that
those
are
sufficient
and
compelling,
sufficiently
compelling
interests
to
survive
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
now,
developing
the
compelling
purpose,
the
corrosive
effects
of
private
financing
of
presidential
campaigns
have,
of
course,
been
well
documented
both
in
congress,
this
court,
and
in
other
writings.
then
congress
determined
to
eliminate
them
by
an
offer
to
substitute
public
funding
so
that
the
presidential
candidate,
in
the
words
of
senator
pastore,
might
take
office
a
free
man,
might
take
office
neither
himself
nor
his
appointees,
his
administration
in
any
way
beholden
to
those
who
had
put
up
the
money
to
elect
him.
the
congress
was
also
aware
that
to
secure
that
purpose
it
had
to
go
beyond
simply
forbidding
the
acceptance
of
contributions
and
the
expenditure
by
the
candidate
and
his
authorized
committees
of
more
than
the
amount
of
the
public
fund...
in
the
1980
election,
$30
million
a
piece.
congress
realized,
and
as
mr.
steele
said,
it
was
explicitly
discussed,
that
there
was
grave
danger
of
subterfuge,
meaning
evasion
not
deceit;
that
there
was
grave
danger
of
circumvention
simply
by
friends
of
the
candidate,
those
who
had
long
been
in
his
party
moving
out,
setting
up
over
here,
without
consultation,
an
independent
committee.
they'd
all
worked
together
for
years.
there'd
be
no
need
for
any
kind
of
consultation.
and
indeed,
history
shows
that
there's
very
grave
danger
that
that
amount
of
private
money
might
very
well
swamp
the
public
funding.
in
addition,
we
submit,
the
congress
had
ample
basis
for
concluding
that
the
members
of
political
committees
who
raise
contributions
and
spend
money
to
elect
the
president,
independently
as
they
characterize
them,
present
a
threat
of
actual
or
apparent
undue
influence
upon
the
successful
candidates
in
this
race.
this
really,
it's
a
matter
of
common
sense,
i
suggest.
there's
not
much
difference
between
the
position
of
the
man
who
says
i
contributed
$5,000,
$25,000...
it
couldn't
be
$25,000
now,
but
$5,000...
to
the
president's
election;
i
want
an
appointment
with
the
assistant
secretary
for
this
or
that
department.
and
the
money,
as
has
often
been
put,
serves
as
a
right
to
get
in
the
door
and
to
get
a
sympathetic
hearing.
well,
there's
not
much
difference
in
the
case
of
someone
who
says
i
spent,
i
raised
and
spent
by
a
political
committee
$5
million.
i
would
like
a
hearing
with
so
and
so,
and
a
sympathetic
hearing.
and
the
effect,
of
course
in
some
cases
there's
no
effect,
and
we
wish
there
would
never
be
an
effect.
in
other
cases
one
doesn't
know.
the
danger
was
the
converse
of
an
expression
of
justin
dart
that
we
quote
in
our
brief,
"dialogue
with
politicians
is
a
fine
thing,
but
with
a
little
money
they
hear
you
better.
"
and
i
suspect
that
in
an
election
where
there
can
be
no
private
contributions,
having
spent
a
large
sum
of
money
may
lead
to
being
heard
better.
mr.
archibald
cox
neither
house
nor
senate
is
yet
publicly
financed,
no.
and
this,
of
course,
even
with
the
president
or
the
presidential
election
is
a
choice
offered
to
the
candidate,
and
9012(f)
applies
only
when
the
president
has
said
i
will
take
the
public
funds;
i
and
my
people
won't
spend
more.
otherwise,
unlike
the
situation
in
buckley
and
valeo,
the
restriction
on
spending
even
by
political
committees
does
not
come
in
to
play.
it
is
only
where
the
candidates
so
choose
it.
this
summer
there
was
a
particularly
egregious
example
of
the
kind
of
coercion
that
may
be
implicit
or
may
be
made
explicit
with
respect
to
expenditures.
the
national
chairman
of
ncpac,
closely
associated
with
the
fund
for
the
conservative
majority,
wrote
to
congressman
badillo
if
you
will
make
a
public
statement
in
support
of
the
president's
tax
cut
package
and
state
that
you
intend
to
vote
for
it,
we
will
withdraw
all
radio
and
newspaper
ads
planned
in
your
district.
in
addition,
we
will
be
glad
to
run
radio
and
newspaper
ads
applauding
you
for
taking
that
position
on
taxes.
now,
i
don't
think
usually
the
threat
would
be
made
that
blatantly.
indeed,
here
one
may
wonder
whether
it
doesn't
even
approach
bribery.
but
this
sort
of
thing
is
implicit
over
and
over
again,
and
congress
said
we
don't
want
it
to
take
place.
we
think
forbidding
it
is
essential
to
put
the
president
and
his
administration
into
office
free
men.
we've
quoted
in
our
briefs
the
opinions
of
externs,
pointing
out
that
those
who
have
the
hold
on
the
candidate
aren't
the
people
who
contribute
to
the
political
committee;
they're
the
people
who
raise
and
control
and
spend
the
money.
and
as
i
said
before,
i
think
the
danger
from
expenditure
is
just
about
as
great
as
the
danger
when
they
raise
contributions
for
the
candidate
directly.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
renderage
of
service
free
is
a
contribution,
as
i
remember,
under
ordinary
circumstances.
i
wouldn't
say
if,
justice
rehnquist,
you're
talking
about
those
people
who
are
close
to
the
candidate
and
help
write
speeches
and
things
like
that,
i
don't
think
i
could
argue
that
9012(f)
covers
everything
that
might
involve
some
sort
of
debt
from
the
candidate.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
don't
think
the
debt
has
half
as
corrosive
effect
on
public
confidence
when
it
comes
from
having
worked
together
rather
than
when
it
just
simply
comes
from
having
raised
and
spent
large
sums
of
money.
it's
the
money
that
has
the...
destroys
the
public
confidence.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
can't
deny
that
there
is
maybe
some
feeling
of
obligation
to
look
out
for
him.
i
just
don't
think
it's
as
serious.
and
i
don't
think
the
failure
to
cover
that
renders
the
statute
so
seriously
under
inclusive
as
to
make
it--
mr.
archibald
cox
--well--
mr.
archibald
cox
--i
would
think
that
if
ten
people
get
together
and
each
puts
up
a
share
and
each
helps
write
the
ad,
that
that
is
not...
does
not
have
the
characteristics
of
a
political
committee.
i
think
the
distinction
lies
primarily
in
the
words
"political
committee",
the
definition
of
"political
committee"
which
the
court
gave
in
buckley
and
valeo
where
it
spoke
of
an
organization,
the
major
purpose
of
which
is
to
promote
the
election
of
candidates.
and
i
think
the
emphasis
is
on
the
word...
an
emphasis,
not
the
only
emphasis...
is
on
the
word
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
the
california
medical
association
case,
about
separate
entities,
something
which
has
a
life
of
its
own.
it
goes
out
and
raises
money
from
others
who
have
no
appreciable
control
over
how
the
money
is
spent
or
over
what
is
said.
now,
that
means
that
there
are
many
forms
of
expression
that
608(e),
which
was
held
unconstitutional
in
buckley
and
valeo,
forbade,
that
the
present
statute
doesn't
reach
even
in
the
context
of
public
funding,
which
itself
is
a
definite.
it
doesn't
reach
individual
expression.
it
doesn't
reach
individuals
acting
jointly
where
it's
short
of
being
an
organization.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
it's
an
issue-oriented
organization,
it's
not
a
political
committee,
to
begin
with.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it's
an
issue-oriented
organization,
it
is
not
reached,
whatever
may
be
its
impact.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
i
think
the
question
would
be
whether
it
could
be
found...
if
it's
really
focusing
on
the
issues
and
it
wishes
to
win
the
day
on
those
issues,
then
i
would
say
it
was
not
covered
by
section
9012(f).
if
the
intent--
mr.
archibald
cox
--i'm
trying
to
relate
this
in
my
mind
to
the
words
of
the
statute:
"knowingly
and
willfully
further
the
election
of
a
candidate.
"
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
case
is
covered
where
if
it's
a
political
committee,
if
they
say
the
best
way
to
elect
our
candidate
is
to
hammer
that
issue.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
archibald
cox
--no,
no.
but
justice
white
asked
me
to
assume,
as
i
understood
it,
that
it
was
a
political
committee
for
all...
in
the
past
and
in
the
future--
mr.
archibald
cox
--we
think
that
interpretation,
which
was
put
on
608(e),
would
not
be
correct
here,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
were
the
only
way
to
save
the
statute,
i
suppose
i
wouldn't
object
to
it.
but
i
think--
mr.
archibald
cox
--you
say
it
would?
i
think
it
would
cover
more
than
that.
i
think
the
question
is
one
of
intent,
and
there
is
no
violation
unless--
mr.
archibald
cox
--well,
i
wouldn't
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
that
first,
as
the
court
indicated
in
buckley
and
valeo,
it
must
be
an
organization,
the
major
purpose
of
which
is
to
elect
candidates.
and
second,
it
must
have
a
specific
intent,
knowingly
and
willfully
to
further
the
candidate.
if
it's
genuinely
concerned
with
its
issue
or
if
its
major
purpose
overall
is
the
issue,
then
it's
not
covered
by
9012(f).
i
think
that
would
cover
just
about
all
issue
orientations.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would...
the
difference
would
be
where
the
advertisement
is
clearly
focused
on
the
election
of
a
candidate,
but
they
avoid
the
use
of,
were
it,
the
name.
the
express
way
in
the
limiting
definition
is
one
that
we
would
not
adopt.
thank
you.
