mr.
charles
nevett
steele
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
amongst
the
responsibilities
of
the
federal
election
commission
is
that
of
administering
the
presidential
election
campaign
fund
act.
that
is
the
act
contained
at
chapter
95
of
subtitle
h
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
provides
that
in
the
general
election
a
grant
of
money
to
the
candidates
of
political
parties.
in
the
1980
election
the
grant
to
the
candidates
of
the
major
parties
was
$29.4
million.
the
statute
provides
that
that
grant
goes
to
the
candidate
of
the
party
within
ten
days
of
his
nomination,
if
he
chooses
it.
the
statute
makes
the
public
funding
provision
optional
for
the
candidates
of
all
parties.
if
they
accept
the
public
funding,
they
agree
to
expenditure
limitations
not
to
exceed
the
amount
of
the
grant,
$29.4
million.
they
also
agree
not
to
accept
private
contributions.
the
statute
has
been
twice
challenged.
the
first
time
it
was
challenged
was
in
the
case
of
buckley
v.
valeo
decided
by
this
court.
the
challenge
there
was
majorly
one
under
the
fifth
amendment,
though
there
was
a
first
amendment
challenge
on
an
analogy
to
the
freedom
of
religion.
but
the
major
challenge
there
was
that
the
statute
as
constructed
discriminated,
discriminated
against
minor
parties
and
new
parties
on
the
grounds
that
by
providing
the
amounts
of
money
before
the
election
to
the
major
parties
that
it
unfairly
advantaged
them
against
parties
which
could
not
obtain
that
pre-election
funding.
this
court
rejected
that
challenge.
it
concluded
that
the
congressional
decision
to
provide
for
public
financing
was
one
well
within
its
power,
its
power
to
legislate
to
protect
elections,
decided
by
this
court
in
burroughs
v.
united
states;
and
that
the
power
over
elections
was
such
that
this
was
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
power
under
the
general
welfare
clause
to
expend
the
monies
that
it
raises.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes,
it
was.
this
case
really
involves
a
third
challenge
to
it,
i
think,
a
challenge
that
was
not
raised
in
buckley;
the
statute
then
was
identical
and
was
not
raised
in
the
second
case,
which
was
the
republican
national
committee,
which
was
a
case
that
was
brought
on
behalf
of
the
supporters
of
the
republican
candidates
in
the
1980
election.
and
the
challenge
there
was
a
straight
first
amendment
challenge
not
similar
to
the
one
in
buckley,
but
that
the
statute,
by
requiring
the
candidates
to
agree
to
an
expenditure
limit,
abridged
the
rights
of
the
candidate's
supporters;
that
the
supporters
by
being
closed
out
in
the
public
financing
system
had
their
first
amendment
rights
abridged.
this
court,
affirming
the
decisions
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
en
banc
court
for
the
second
circuit,
concluded
that
there
was
no
such
violation
of
first
amendment
rights.
as
set
forth
in
the
court's
decisions
below,
they
noted
that
individuals
in
the
public
financing
system
have
substantial
opportunities
for
participating
in
that
system,
and
listed
them
there.
in
effect,
this
is
a
third
challenge.
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
first
amendment,
another
first
amendment
challenge,
that
the
supporters
of
the
republican
candidate
have
their
first
amendment
rights
violated
because
contributions
that
they
wish
to
make
cannot
be
translated
into
independent
expenditures
by
political
committees;
rather
than
the
challenge
in
the
rnc
case
which
was
that
their
first
amendment
rights
of
supporters
were
abridged
because
they
could
not
give
to
the
candidate,
and
the
candidate
could
not
expend
those
monies.
this
is
a
challenge
that
those
supporters'
first
amendment
rights
are
violated
because
they
cannot
give
that
money
to
a
political
committee
which
will
in
turn
transform
those
into
expenditures.
the
case
arose
in
the
following
fashion.
in
the
early
summer
of
1980
the
three
respondents
announced
plans
that
they
would
each
raise
funds,
take
contributions,
aggregate
those
funds,
take
contributions
from
corporate
pacs,
take
contributions
from
union
pacs,
take
contributions
from
other
political
committees,
take
contributions
from
individuals.
they
qualified
themselves
as
multi-candidate
committees
under
the
statute.
those
multi-candidate
committees
are
permitted
to
take
contributions
of
$5,000
under
the
statute
in
this
court's
decision
in
buckley,
as
opposed
to
those
of
other
political
committees
which
are
limited
to
$1,000
contributions.
they
announced
plans
that
they
were
going
to
raise
these
monies
and
expend
them
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
an
unlimited
right
to
make
those
kind
of
expenditures.
there
was
no
application
as
to
whether
or
not
the
act
applied
to
those;
though
i
would
note
that
one
of
the
respondents,
the
americans
for
an
effective
presidency,
sought
and
then
withdrew
for
an
opinion,
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
commission
as
to
whether
the
statute
prohibited
their
activities,
indicating
that
they
felt
that
there
was
a
constitutional
problem;
but
that
opinion
was
withdrawn.
beyond
that,
none
of
them
applied
for
what
the
act
does
provide,
which
is
a
declaration
as
to
whether
the
act
prohibits
the
activities
that
they
were
involved--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--yes.
that
was
not
a
commission
decision.
that
was
an
informational
letter.
that
was
during
the
period
after
buckley
when
the
commission--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--i
think
that
the
commission
has
not.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
the
arguments
that
i
understand
the
respondents
to
be
making
are,
first,
that
the
commission
in
considering
regulations
in
1976
after
this
court's
decision
in
buckley,
the
commission
after
its
reconstitution
in
may
had
hearings
during
june
and
july
attempting
to
get
regulations
in
place
for
the
1976
election.
during
those
hearings
there
was
a
substantial
portion
of
those
hearings,
two
days
of
those
hearings,
half
of
two
days
of
those,
devoted
to
the
question
of
9012(f).
respondents
argue
that
the
commission,
by
not
adopting
a
regulation
that
repeated
the
words
of
the
statute,
indicated
that
somehow
that
the
commission
had
decided
that
that
was
not
applicable
to
independent
expenditures.
i
don't
see
how
the
nonadoption
of
the
statutory
words
in
a
regulation
yields
that
result.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
that's
correct.
with
regard
to
the
informational
letter
that
you
asked
about,
as
i
say,
that
was
an
informational
letter
coming
out
of
the
staff.
i
think
that
there
is
language
in
there
that
is
probably...
cuts
against
that
position,
but
i
don't
think
that
was
an
official
commission
position.
and
moreover,
the
requesting
party
there
said
right
up
what
it
was
doing
was
the
so-called
button
and
bows
exemption
which
was
enacted
in
'79...
small,
less
than
$1,000,
small
items.
and
the
real
question
there
was
there
was
that--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--that
is
correct.
as
i
was
saying,
i
think
that
one
of
the
respondents
here,
the
americans
for
change,
argues
to
this
court
that
there
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
would
allow
it
to
avoid
that.
they
did
not
seek
an
interpretation
before
the
commission.
the
other
parties
all
seem
to
agree
that
basically
the
statute
prohibits
it.
in
any
event,
the
activity
was
undertaken
on
the
grounds
of
the
feelings
of
the
respondents
that
their
constitutional
rights
allowed
them
to
do
that
activity.
in
the
face
of
these
plans,
the
commission,
which
under
the
statute
in
section
9011(b)
of
title
26
is
authorized
to
bring
suits
to
implement
or
construe
provisions
of
the
fund
act,
brought
this
suit,
brought
it
in
the
statutorily
required
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
that
is
a
question
which
has
never
come
in
front
of
the
commission,
so
that
my
answer
would
be,
is
not
something
that
an
interpretation
that
i
think
the
commission
in
any
way
has
made.
but
it
would
seem
that
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
to
further
the
election
of
a
candidate,
and
that
an
expenditure
to
defeat
one,
even
where
there
are
three,
would
be
one
that
would
further
the
election
of
anybody
but.
so
that
i
would
think
that
there
is
an
argument
under
the
statute
that
that
certainly
is
something
that
would
further
the
election.
i
would
reiterate
again
that
i
do
not
think
that
that
question
has
been
posed
to
the
commission,
either
by
the
facts
of
this
case
or
in
any
request
for
an
advisory--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--well,
i
think
that
under
buckley
v.
valeo
and
numerous
other
court
decisions
of
this
court,
but
buckley
v.
valeo
most
prominently
because
it
is
in
the
area,
that
this
court
has
articulated
a
balancing
standard:
that
the
rights,
the
first
amendment
rights,
i
think
that
there
are
first
amendment
rights
implicated
here,
because
there
is
under
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
there
is
the
expenditure
of
money
to
achieve
statements
of
political
ends.
but
the
court
below,
i
think,
which
found
the
statute
constitutional,
in
effect
said
that
the
balance
that
congress
here
struck
in
trying
to
protect
individual
rights
in
the
public
financing
scheme
was
not
a
valid
one.
but
i
think
it
very
clear,
and
i
hope
that
our
brief
which
i
will
try
not
to
go
through
all
of
the
legislative
history,
but
do
not
thereby
wish
to
avoid
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
major
thrusts
of
our
brief,
which
is
that
congress
considered
this
statute,
considered
the
problems,
including
the
constitutional
problems,
and
struck
a
balance
that
it
felt
that
did
what
its
major
purpose
was,
which
was
to,
under
the
federal
funding
statute,
which
was
to
create
a
substitute
for
private
financing,
to
allow
within
that,
to
allow
individuals
substantial
opportunities
to
continue
to
participate
in
the
elections.
again,
i
cited
the
rnc
case
where
i
think
there
was
a
long
recitation
of
those.
we
have
set
those
forth
in
the
ends
of
our
brief.
but
there
are
substantial
rights
protected
by
the
statute.
it
is
not
considered
to
be
a
contribution
under
the
statute
for
a
person
to
offer
their
services.
it
is
not
considered
a
contribution
under
the
statute
for
people
travel
on
behalf
of
a
candidate
up
to
an
amount
of
$2,000.
there
is
an
exemption
for
use
of
homes,
and
it's
broadened
so
that
it's
not
merely
a
personal
home
but
in
effect
is
shelter,
and
that
there
are
substantial
opportunities
for
individuals
to
participate.
section
9012(f)
itself
makes
very
clear,
and
if
it's
not
clear
by
the
fact
that
it
refers
only
to
political
committees,
it
seems
to
me
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
balanced
to
allow
individuals
to
make
expenditures
under
the
statute.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
the
statute
provides
for
other
parties
to
bring
such
an
action,
so
i
think
it
is
not
the
commission's
position
that
only
the
commission
can.
the
question
in
my
mind
then
becomes,
and
i
would
in
a
sense
say
that
the
jurisdictional
question
there
then
becomes
whether
or
not
the
action
is
one
really
to
implement
or
construe
the
statute;
that
in
effect
that
what
i
would
say
is
that
it
is
not
a
substitute
for
actions
to
enforce
the
act
under
437(g)
or
other
provisions.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes.
congress,
in
enacting
the
public
financing
statute,
explicitly
sought
to
establish
it
as
an
alternate
to
private
financing...
not
a
mandatory
alternate
but
one
chosen
by
the
candidate.
in
so
doing,
congress
looked
at
what
it
saw
as
the
reality
of
political
life
and
debated
the
problem
that
would
arise
if
having
limited
that
fund,
committees
were
able
to
be
formed
to
expend
unlimited
amounts
of
money
and
thereby
to
in
effect
dwarf
the
fund.
for
congress
saw,
congress
debated...
indeed,
at
pages
22
and
23
of
our...
21
and
22
of
our
brief,
going
slightly
over
to
23,
is
a
series
of
debates
in
the
1971
history.
we
have
earlier
referred
to
the
fact
of
the
1966-67
history
which
first
drafted
the
statute.
but
there
were
attempts
to
go
both
ways.
there
were
attempts
by
some
senators
to
say
if
you
allow
a
thousand
dollars
per
committee,
you
are
allowing
a
substantial
loophole.
you
are
allowing...
there
will
be
committees
formed
all
over
the
place
that
will
expend
money
in
amounts
up
to
a
thousand
dollars,
and
it
will
substantially
undercut
the
fund.
there
were
amendments
that
sought
to
reject
the
idea
that
individuals
could
spend
money,
saying
that
well,
if
you
allow
individuals
to
spend
money,
they,
too,
will
undercut
the
fund.
there
were
other
attempts
to
amend
the
statute
to
say
well,
we
need
to
broaden
this.
we
need
to
let
more
come
out
here.
there
was
substantial
talk
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals.
and
in
effect,
the
choice
that
the
congress
made...
and
i
think
it's
clear
in
that
history
and
clear
in
the
statute...
was
an
attempt
to
prohibit
large,
aggregated
wealth
from
dominating
over
the
public
fund,
while
protecting
the
individual
rights.
turning
to
the
question...
the
decision
of
the
district
court
below,
the
three-judge
district
court
below,
the
court
there
analyzed
this
case
as
basically
one
that
involved
only
the
pooling
of
funds.
in
effect,
they
rejected
the
congressional
assessment
of
the
fact
that
political
committees,
particularly
large,
multi-candidate
committees
such
as
these,
were
very
different
from
individuals
who
merely
pooled
funds.
in
effect,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
suggests
that
as
pooling
agents
these
committees
directly
exercise
the
first
amendment
rights
that
an
individual
would
be
doing.
the
congressional
judgment
was
very
different.
the
congressional
judgment
was
that
this
was
not
central
to
the
individual's
right.
and
the
question
of
the
statutory
test
comes
forward
here.
i
would
say
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
v.
valeo
that
the
test
of
a
public
financing
statute
such
as
this
is
whether
it
serves
a
rational
basis,
and
that
in
that
vein
that
the
congressional
decision
that
in
order
to
protect
this
fund,
in
order
to
have
this
fund
not
dwarfed
so
that
a
candidate
looking
out
over
the
whole
political
scene
would
not
have
to
think
i
know
that
out
there
there
is
substantial
amounts
of
money;
i
must
woo
that
money,
if
i
am
going
to
be
successful
in
my
candidacy.
and
people
can
spend,
as
the
three
committees
here
did,
approximately
$9
million
in
the
course
of
election,
a
sum
that's
roughly
one-third
of
that
which
the
public
fund
provides.
if
they
look
out
in
future
years
knowing
that
in
this
election
there
were
these
three
respondents
and
two
other
committees
that
did
that,
but
that
there
are
some
1,200
political
action
committees
of
corporations,
political
action
committees
of
unions
that
will,
if
the
decision
below
is
upheld,
be
able
to
spend
that
kind
of
money,
any
candidate
will
have
to
woo
that
money.
he
will
have
to
consider
that
the
positions
he
takes,
the
arguments
he
makes
will
necessarily
be
swayed
by
the
expenditure
of
that
money;
and
that
is
precisely
what
congress
sought
to
avoid
with
the
public
financing
statute.
for
one
of
the
purposes
approved
by
this
court
was
the
ability
to
free
the
candidate
from
having
to
seek
those
private
funds,
put
forward
this
system
of
public
financing
as
a
substitute,
not
merely
as
a
supplement.
and
indeed,
in
this
court's
decision,
the
rationale
for
rejecting
the
fifth
amendment
challenge,
the
discriminatory
challenge,
was
precisely
that;
that
the
new
parties
and
so
forth
were
not
disadvantaged
because
there
was
this
cap,
because
there
was
this
substitute.
they
could
seek
money;
they
could
seek
money
outside
the
system.
and
therefore,
though
the
major
parties
were
given
this
subsidy,
the
minor
parties
were
not
disadvantaged
in
the
constitutional
sense
because
they
were
still
able
to
raise
the
private
funds.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
i
think
that
though
perhaps
in
reality
one
might
be
able
to
decide
that
getting
out
the
vote
overall
might
benefit
one
candidate,
i
think
that
that's
a
decision...
to
say
that
that
was
what
congress
meant
of
furthering
the
election
of
one
candidate
would
be
astray;
in
effect,
that
legally
the
getting
out
the
vote...
and
indeed,
the
statute
very
explicitly
protects
get
out
the
vote
activity
in
a
number
of
ways;
indeed,
it's
a
question
that
the
commission
has
wrestled
within
the
context
of
whether
simple
signs
saying
"get
out
the
vote",
paid
for
by
committees
and
so
forth,
are
ones
that
violate
the
statute.
but
that
in
effect
that
get
out
the
vote,
even
though
one
might
be
able
in
a
political
science
sense
to
say
that
it
had
indeed
advantaged
one
candidate
over
the
other,
was
not
what
congress
was
aiming
at
when
it
was
speaking
of
furthering
the
election
of
a
candidate.
the
court
below
spoke
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
here;
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
quid
pro
quo
between
these
independent
committees
and
that
of
the
candidate.
again,
it
would
seem
that
that
judgment
is
one
in
which
the
court
below
says
that,
in
effect,
that
the
congress
was
wrong,
because
the
congress'
judgment,
in
effect,
was
first
of
all
that
the
interest
here
was
for
public
financing,
to
protect
the
public
financing;
that
there
did
not
need
to
be
a
quid
pro
quo.
even
accepting
the
argument
that
a
quid
pro
quo
is
necessary,
that
corruption
is
necessary
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
is
necessary,
the
court
below
did
not
really
come
to
grips
with
the
congressional
judgment
that
if
you
had
large-scale
committees
like
this,
you
were
inevitably
in
a
situation
where
a
candidate
needed
to
pay
attention
to
what
those
committees
brought
forth,
needed,
in
effect,
to
decide
that
if
he
did
not
pay
attention
to
what
those
committees
were
advocating,
he
would
not
be
able
to...
he
would
not
be
as
likely
to
be
as
successful
in
his
election
campaign.
in
effect,
congress'
judgment
was
that
the
dangers
of
a
quid
pro
quo
that
were
there
were
very
great,
and
that
in
any
event
that
if
you
have
a
public
financing
system
set
forth
by
$29.4
million,
if
the
private
funding
goes
well
beyond
that
in
the
terms
that
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
that
many
of
the
senators
use,
that
committees
will
be
created
to
go
beyond
the
authorization
of
this
act;
that
if
you
have
a
system
where
the
private
funding
is
$60
million
or
$90
million...
that
was
not
true
in
this
election;
it
was
$9
million
roughly,
as
i
say,
one-third...
but
that
if
you
have
a
situation
such
as
that,
that
you
have
the
public
fund
being
merely
a
takeoff
point.
it
is
merely
a
subsidy.
it
is
a
subsidy
then
to
the
parties,
the
major
parties
or
to
minor
parties
who
have
obtained
the
five
percent
in
the
last
election,
which
would
not
be
for
the
full
$29.4
million
but
in
a
ratio.
but
that
there
is
only
then
a
system
not
of
a
substitute
of
public
financing,
but
of
a
system
where
public
financing
is
a
supplement
to
private
financing.
the
congress
rejected
that
idea,
rejected
that
idea
in
the
basic
statute,
rejected
that
idea
in
9012(f)
itself
explicitly.
as
i
say,
i
do
not
want
to...
i
certainly
don't
have
the
time
to
go
through
all
the
congressional
history
again;
but
i
would
make
once
more
the
point
that
i
think
that
our
brief
has
set
forth,
is
that
this
was
a
very
explicit
congressional
choice.
this
was
not
something
that
crept
up
unawares
on
the
congress.
congress
debated
this
in
'66-'67.
when
the
statute
came
back
in
'71,
it
occupied
them
for
a
long
period
of
time
during
those
debates.
as
i
say,
there
were
amendments
back
and
forth.
the
congressional
choice
here
was
to
protect
public
financing
and
to
prohibit
the
private
financing
by
political
committees.
it
made
a
very
distinct
balancing.
it
does
not
prohibit
it
entirely.
it
allowed
it
up
to
a
thousand
dollars
for
these
political
committees.
again,
these
political
committees
are
aggregations
of
wealth.
i
would
reserve
the
remainder.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
i
would
like
to
make,
i
think,
two
points:
one,
with
regard
to
the
dangers
that
expenditures
pose.
i
think
that
the
suggestion
here
by
the
committees
is
that
expenditures
do
not
pose
such
a
danger.
i
think
that
the
congress
in
this
statute
and
in
similar
statutes
outside
the
hatch
act
and
441(b),
which
is
the
prohibitions
on
corporations
and
labor
organizations,
has
explicitly
made
that
judgment
that
expenditures
present
the
same
kind
of
danger
as
contributions.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
something
that
i
said
earlier,
which
is
with
regard
to
the
ability
of
individuals
to
engage
in
activity
which
is
protected
by
the
act,
specifically
with
regard
to
the
example
that
justice
rehnquist
proposed
of
personal
services;
that
the
act
in
section
431,
the
definitional
section,
the
first
statement
is
that
a
contribution
does
not
include
such
services.
in
other
words,
again,
the
act
in
many
places
has
made
a
balancing
between
things
which
would
be...
certainly
are
things
of
value
to
a
campaign
and
certainly
are
things
that
the
campaign
may
be
very
happy
to
have,
but
it's
balance
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
do
that
kind
of
services,
again
mentioning
also
in
our
brief
the
travel
and
the
housing.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
is
an
issue
committee
rather
than
a
political
committee.
i
do
not
think
that
the
commission
had
ruled
on
that;
it
has
not
been
asked
that
specific
question.
it
did
have
a
case
where
the
allegation
was
made
that
mobil
oil
by
making
an
expenditure
putting
forth
the
position
on
what
should
happen
to
the
development
of
oil,
that
that
was
not...
and
in
an
area
where
there
were
two
candidacies,
were
senate
candidates,
but
i
think
the
principle
holds
true...
that
one
candidate
was
in
favor
of
controlling
the
oil
companies
and
one
was
not,
that
that
was
not
violating
the
prohibitions
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
yes.
i
agree.
but
i
was
saying
that
in
terms
of
places
where
i
think
the
commission
has
been.
i
would
think
that
where
you
do
not
have
the
connection
of
an
issue
to
a
vote
explicitly
that
that
is
right
at
the
borderline.
i
would
say
that
where
a
committee
is
speaking
only
to
issues
and
is
not
making
the
connection
over
the
candidates,
i
would
think
that
was
not
necessarily
a
political
committee.
and
i
would
think
more
prominently
for
purposes
of
9012(f)
that
you
would
not
have
a
file...
you
have
the
knowing
and
willfully
furthering
the
election.
so
you
would
have
to
say
that
by
coming
out
on
an
issue
that
the
committee
was
knowingly
and
willfully
attempting
to
further
the
election.
and
i
would
think
that,
therefore,
there
would
be
another
element
that
would
say
that
that
expenditure--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--i
think
in
some
sense
you
do,
and
i
think
that
with
regard
to
what
justice
marshall
said
earlier,
one
of
the
things
that
this
act
has
attempted
to
do,
and
i
think
has
done
in
9012(f),
is
attempt
to
put
a
barrier
so
that
you
don't
really
have
to
look
in
to
each
instance
of
a
quid
pro
quo
and
make
those
kind
of
factual
investigations.
if
the
commission
were
to
have
to
make
that
kind
of
determination,
what
professor
cox
referred
to
as
looking
to
see
whether
the
intent
was
to
further
the
election,
you
get
into
a
very
difficult
area.
and
i
think
to
some
extent
the
statute
has
tried
to
make
a
prophylactic
rule.
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
i
could
see--
mr.
charles
nevett
steele
--i
don't
see
the
problem
in
terms
of
the
way
the
statute
has
phrased
it.
again,
there
are
some
limits
to
the
english
language
in
terms
of
the
specificity,
and
"to
further
the
election"
does
not
answer
every
question,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
a
strong
guide
to
what
congress
meant.
