mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
gift
tax
is
imposed
upon
all
gifts,
direct
and
indirect.
that
is
the
teaching
of
section
2511
of
the
code.
a
disclaimer
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case
provides
a
mechanism
for
indirect
gifts,
because
property
which
is
directed
to
a
person
who
doesn't
want
it,
he
can
disclaim
and
in
the
act
of
disclaiming
he
causes
that
property,
that
interest
to
be
directed
to
the
next
party
in
succession.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
this
is
not
an
indirect
gift
to
an
identifiable
person,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
for
gift
tax
purposes
that
is
of
no
consequence.
this
court
in
robinette
v.
helvering
almost
40
years
ago
said
gifts
of
future
interest
are
taxable
under
the
act,
and
they
do
not
lose
this
quality
merely
because
of
the
indefiniteness
of
the
eventual
recipient.
the
petitioner
is
purported
to
give
the
property
to
someone
whose
identity
could
be
later
ascertained,
and
this
was
enough.
that
is
the
purport
and
operation
of
the
gift
tax.
now,
there
is
an
exception
which
takes
a
disclaimer
outside
the
operation
of
the
gift
tax,
and
that
is
the
exception,
the
grace
period,
the
act
of
grace,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
put
it,
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
regulation
is
section
1.2511-1(c),
and
it
provides
that
a
disclaimer
can
be
made
free
of
gift
tax
if
two
requirements
are
fulfilled:
one,
it
must
be
valid
and
effective
under
state
law;
and
two,
it
must
be
made
within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
if
those
requirements
are
met,
the
tax
law
will
consider
that
the
disclaimant
never
had
the
property
and
did
not
transfer
it
to
the
next
person
or
class
in
line,
but
that
it
passed
directly
from
the
settlor
or
the
testate
or
here
the
testatrix
to
the
next
person
in
line.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
the
brown-hardenbergh
cases
which
have
been
discussed
in
the
brief
deal
solely
with
the
question
of
the
disclaimant's
capability
under
state
law.
if
you
will
recall,
hardenbergh
was
a
case
in
which
a
person
took
by
intestacy,
and
the
court
held
that
under
state
law
a
person
who
took
by
intestacy
was
incapable
under
state
law
of
disclaiming,
that
he
had
to
take
it,
that
state
policy
required
it.
in
brown
that
was
the
situation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
those
cases
dealt
with
the
situation
of
the
disclaimant's
capability
of
lack
of
capability
under
state
law.
and
indeed,
the
regulation
uses
state
law
as
one
of
the
requirements;
that
if
a
disclaimant,
at
least
before
the
1981
act,
was
incapable
of
making
a
disclaimer
under
state
law,
he
wasn't
going
to
come
within
this
exception,
and
he
was
going
to
have
made
a
taxable
gift.
that's
what
happened
in
the
hardenbergh
case,
because
under
state
law
the
disclaimant
there
was
someone
who
took
by
intestacy,
and
as
a
result
he
couldn't
disclaim,
and
he
was
deemed
to
have
made
a
taxable
gift.
in
brown
he
wasn't
such
a
person.
it
was
a
surviving
husband
who
decided
that
he
didn't
want
his
wife's
property.
but
this
much
is
clear,
that
the
regulation
has
two
requirements:
one,
capability
under
state
law,
and
two,
that
the
disclaimer
must
be
made
within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
now,
how
do
these
principles
apply
in
this
case?
we
have
no
quarrel
here.
the
parties
had
no
quarrel
that
this
was
a
valid
and
effective
disclaimer
under
massachusetts
law.
but
the
parties
do
quarrel
about
whether
mr.
jewett
made
a
disclaimer
within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
here
the
grandmother,
margaret,
died
in
1939,
but
mr.
jewett,
the
grandson,
did
not
disclaim
until
1972,
33
years
after
the
transfer.
now,
that
was
24
years
after
he
obtained
his
majority
because
mr.
jewett
was
born
in
1927.
now,
this
might
have
been
valid
and
effective
under
state
law
because
the
policies
of
whether
a
disclaimer
will
be
given
effect
under
state
law,
as
judge
rahm
ably
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
tax
court,
have
little,
if
anything,
to
do
with
the
policies
underlying
the
gift
tax.
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
he
concluded...
and
we
feel
the
facts
fully
support
his
conclusion...
were
these
disclaimers
made
within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
and
indeed,
my
brother
here
does
not
argue,
and
indeed
he
really
couldn't,
that
the
33-year
period
or
the
24-year
period
would
be
a
reasonable
time,
nor
does
he
attempt
to
justify
this
inordinate
delay
on
any
special
fact
that
knowledge
was
withheld
from
him.
how
does
he
claim
to
meet
this
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer?
well,
he
first
claims
on
reliance
on
the
keinath
case
that
state
law
is
sufficient.
now,
that
is,
in
our
view,
a
very
peculiar
opinion,
because
what
it
does
is
deal
with
the
state
law
requirement
and
then
say
that
in
dealing
with...
after
acknowledging,
as
i
think
the
court
must,
that
there
is
a
federal
timeliness
requirement
under
the
regulation,
the
court
in
keinath
said
well,
how
do
we
know
what's
timely
for
federal
purposes?
well,
what
can
we
do;
we
have
to
look
to
state
law.
so
the
court
doubles
back
on
its
analysis
and
then
finds
a
minnesota
statute
that
within
the
context
of
that
case
that
the
19-year
period
was
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
the
keinath
case?
well,
the
solicitor
general
i
think
had
a
healthy
concern
for
the
court's
docket,
and
i
think
in
the
absence
of
a
conflict,
the
keinath
case
would
not
have
been
an
appropriate
case
to
petition.
here
we
had--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--we
always
like
to
win.
to
that
extent
we're
no
different
than--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no.
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
1976
act
can
only
be
viewed
as
entirely
neutral
on
the
question
before
this
court.
in
1976
congress
established
a
nine-month
period
for
purposes
of
establishing
a
uniform
period
of
reasonable
time,
and
in
considering
the
legislation
in
1976
it
noted
the
keinath
opinion,
and
perhaps
the
most
you
could
say
about
it
is
it
viewed
it
somewhat
as
an
aberration.
it
said
in
a
footnote
that
indeed
there
is
a
case
in
which
19
years
was
regarded
as
a
reasonable
time,
and
i
suppose
congress
thought
that
that
was
entirely
too
long
a
period
of
time
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
but
i
don't
think
that...
i
would
not
attempt
to
make
anything
affirmative
out
of
the
1976
act
other
than
to
say
that
for
years
involving
transfers
creating
interest,
after
december
1976
the
rule
is
nine
months,
and
also
valid
and
effective
under
state
law.
indeed,
the
law
has
been
revised
again,
and
the
1981
tax
act
has
now
abolished
the
requirement
that
the
disclaimer
be
valid
and
effective
under
state
law,
because
congress
found
that
there
was
a
lack
of
uniformity
within
the
states
as
to
what
would
be
a
valid
and
effective
disclaimer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
yes,
it
did.
it
said
nine
months
from
either
the...
to
the
time
the
interest
was
created
or
from
the
period--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
mean
the
whole
statute
doesn't
apply
here
by
its
terms,
and
i
think
it's
really
reading
too
much
to
say
that
congress
was
attempting
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
the
pre-'76
years.
and
i
take
strong
issue
with
petitioner's
attempt
to
attempt
to--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--indeed,
indeed.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--exactly.
i
mean
congress
normally
in
the
estate
and
gift
tax
area
normally
legislates
prospectively
in
order
not
to
disturb,
and
when
it
does
legislate
retroactively,
it
usually
provides
for
some
sort
of
grace
period
to
allow
people
to
amend
their
instruments.
and
here
they
were
simply
legislating
prospectively.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no.
but
this
is
a
traditional
way
that
congress
acts
in
the
estate
and
gift
tax
area.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
i
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
i
think
that's
a
different
case.
but
of
course
here
judge
rahm's
opinion
was
reviewed
by
the
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
may
well
be,
but
i
think
we're--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
think
that
the
foundation
has
been
shored
up
effectively
by
the
opinion
in
this
case,
which
i
think
goes
a
long
way
to
satisfy
any
concerns
that
one
might
have
about
whether
this
kind
of
case
could
meet
the
reasonable
time
requirements
under
the
regulation.
here
we
submit
that
the
only
way
the
petitioner
can
prevail
here
is
if
he
says...
and
this
is
what
i
was
getting
to...
was
that
the
interest...
that
the
time
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
the
death
of
the
life
beneficiary.
but
in
our
view,
and
i
think
judge
rahm
pointed
it
out
quite
cogently,
that
this
argument
flies
in
the
face
of
the
whole
structure
of
the
gift
tax.
i
mean,
one
can
have
a
gift
of
a
future
interest.
the
court
said
that
in
smith
v.
shaughnessy,
and
the
fourth
circuit
said
it
in
procter;
that
future
interests
are
perfectly
appropriate
for
gifts.
and
the
fact
that
this
was
a
contingent
remainder,
all
that
does
is
go
to
value.
in
other
words,
one
can
sit
down
and
figure
out
how
valuable
is
an
$8
million
remainder
when
the
intervening
life
beneficiary
is
71
years
old,
as
she
was
in
1972.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
response
i
would
simply
say
that
the
word--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--but
a
contingent
remainder
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
decedent's
property.
i
mean,
you
know,
one
can
divide
property
up
into--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
but
what
she
did
was
take
her
property
and
divide
it
up
in
a
particular
sort
of
way;
and
i
submit
that
the
contingent
remainder
to
this
grandson
is
a
property
interest.
it's
property.
i
mean,
i
don't
really
think
there's
any
quarrel
about
that,
and
the
fact
that
one
can...
future
interests
like
this
are
subject
to
the
gift
tax.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
brown
case,
as
the
tax
court
pointed
out
here,
really
speaks
to
the
issue.
brown
was
dealing
with
an
estate
tax
question
under
the
1921
act.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true,
but
it
really
doesn't
deal
with...
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
whole
timeliness
question
i
think
the
court
has
to
face
in
this
case.
it
dealt
simply
with
the
question
whether
you
were
going
to
allow
this
sort
of
thing
to
pass
as
a
marital
bequest
in
that
situation
where
the
matter...
where
the
interest
had
or
had
not
vested.
and
i
think
that
the
technical
memorandum
that
has
been
bandied
about
here
and
the
question
of
whether
the
regulation
meant
to
adopt
or
codify
brown
v.
routzahn
and
hardenbergh
only
speaks
to
the
question
of
the
disclaimant's
capability
under
state
law.
and
that
is
the
first
criterion
of
the
regulation.
there's
nothing
in
any
of
the
memoranda
or
really...
and
i
think
petitioner
can
cite
nothing
in
brown
that
has
anything
to
do
with
timeliness
with
respect
to
the
question
that
the
court
has
here.
the
second
requirement
in
the
regulation,
that
the
disclaimer
be
made
within
a
reasonable
time
after...
i
don't
want
to
paraphrase...
within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
here,
the
transfer
the
way
the
gift
tax
works
occurred
in
1939
when
the
grandmother
died,
and
the
transfer
was
made
to
the
testamentary
trust.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
brown
case
may
have
said
that,
but
the
brown
case
didn't
really
deal
with
the
question
of
timeliness.
and
i
don't
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
because
the
regulation
talked
about
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
make
this
after...
that
yes,
it
did
adopt
the
capability
of
state
law
aspect
of
brown,
but
it
went
further.
it
also
went
to
the
question
of
reasonable
time,
and
that
really
goes
to
the
whole
essence,
i
think,
of
what
the
gift
tax
is
all
about.
and
that's
really
what
separates
this
case
from
the
state
law
considerations
that
the
eighth
circuit
considered
in
keinath.
the
essence
of
the
gift
tax
in
this
area
is
time,
because
here
this
taxpayer,
mr.
jewett,
to
be
sure
he
was
12
years
old
in
1939,
but
he
was
21
years
old
in
1948.
and
yet,
he
didn't
disclaim
this
interest
until
1972.
from
1948
to
1972
his
family
presumably
developed.
he
was
able
to
measure
his
assets
to
be
able
to
figure
out
whether
he
needed
the
money
from
his
grandmother's
trust
or
not,
who
would
take
it
if
or
perhaps
what
class
of
people
would
take
it
if
he
didn't
disclaim
or
did
disclaim.
in
fact,
he
was
able
to
use
the
mechanism
of
disclaimer
as
an
inter
vivos
estate
planning
device.
and
i
don't
say
that
with
any
disparagement,
but
i'm
saying
simply
that
that
kind
of
process,
that
kind
of
mental
process
of
thinking
what
i
would
like
to
have
done
with
grandmother's
money
is
really
what
the
gift
tax
was
designed
to
reach.
it
was
designed
to
reach
that
sort
of
thing.
and
if
it
persists
over
a
33
or
a
24-year
period,
that
really
is
what
the
gift
tax
was
designed
to
reach.
this
court
held
in
the
weams
case
that
congress
intended
by
the
gift
tax
to
reach
all
sorts
of
arrangements,
all
sorts
of
protean
arrangements
that
could
devise
to
pass
things.
and
the
reasonable
time
requirement
under
the
regulation
was
designed
to
say
look,
if
you're
going
to
have
property
come
to
you
and
interest
come
to
you,
and
you
don't
want
it,
you
have
to
make
up
your
mind
promptly
to
more
or
less
cleanse
yourself
of
the
notion
that
you're
attempting
to
jockey
with
this
and
to
use
it
to
place
it
with
these
people
or
this
object
of
your
bounty.
i
think
it's
important
to--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
there
are
aspects
of
cottrell,
as
i
recall,
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that's
right.
i
think
that
keinath
is
wrong,
and
i
don't
think
that...
i
think
that
it's
a
kind
of
peculiar
thing,
as
i
was
alluding
to
earlier,
the
fact
that
the
court
would
say
all
right,
this
was
valid
and
effective
under
state
law,
and
now
we
do
have
the
question
of
federal
timeliness...
you
know,
there's
no
quarrel
about
that...
and
how
do
we
figure
out
what's
timely
under
the
federal
statute.
well,
we
have
to
look
to
state
law.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
chasing
yourself
around
a
circle,
and
i
really
think
that
the
fact
that
19
years
may
have
been
effective
under
a
timely
period
under
minnesota
law
doesn't
really
answer
the
question
here.
i
think
that
the
disclaimant
in
keinath
was
equally
engaged
in
the
kind
of
thoughtful
and
leisurely
estate
planning
mental
process
that
mr.
jewett
was
engaged
in
in
this
case,
and
indeed,
i
share--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
mean
obviously
in
the
absence
of
a
conflict
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case,
i
think,
that
the
solicitor
general
would
seek
to
ask
this
court
to
exercise
its
discretionary
jurisdiction
to
review;
but
now
that
we
do
have
a
conflict,
as
we
pointed
out
in
response
to
the
petitioner,
we
acquiesced
in
this
case
because
there
are
some
$10
million
worth
of
cases
pending.
and
despite
the
fact
that
there
have
been
two
successive
statutory
actions
by
congress
in
'76
and
last
summer
as
well
that
have
issued
more
precise
rules
in
this
area,
didn't
make
us
want
to
resist
what
was
a
clear
allegation
of
a
conflict
here.
we
think
that
the
tax
court's
tenacity
was
well
exercised
here.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case...
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case
that
the
gift
tax
was
designed
to
attack.
the
state
law
that
the
keinath
court
so
heavily
relied
on
deals
with
entirely
different
policies,
deals
with
questions
of
competing
claimants
and
creditors;
and
indeed,
here
where
you
have
a
24
or
33-year
period,
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
a
massachusetts
court
would
permit
mr.
jewett
to
disclaim
his
interest.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
entirely
a
matter
for
a
state
court
to
resolve
on
property
law
context.
but
the
essence
of
the
gift
tax
is
time.
and
i
think
that
what
judge
rahm
said,
and
if
i
may
just
read
a
few
sentences
from
page
18
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
i
think
it
really
summarizes
what
this
case
is
all
about.
"the
petitioner
possessed
for
24
years
the
effective
right
to
determine
who
shall
ultimately
receive
the
benefits
of
a
50
percent
remainder
interest
of
a
trust
which
in
1972
had
a
corpus
of
approximately
$8
million.
"
"he
waited
to
act
in
respect
of
that
remainder
interest
until
the
surviving
life
beneficiary
was
over
70
years
of
age
and
until
he
himself
was
45,
and
it
appears
a
man
of
substantial
means.
"
"in
fact,
he
had
given
$2
million
between
'58
and
'72.
"
"in
1972
by
the
execution
of
two
disclaimers
he
elected
to
let
the
property
pass
according
to
the
alternative
provisions
of
his
grandmother's
will
to
the
natural
objects
of
his
bounty.
"
"this,
we
hold,
was
an
exercise
of
control
over
the
disposition
of
property
subject
to
the
gift
tax.
"
i
don't
really
think
that
really
one
can
quarrel
with
that
kind
of
analysis
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
one
can
read
property
to
mean
the
actual
property
that
one
puts
in
one's
pocket,
but
the
gift
and
estate
tax
is
replete
with
the
fact
that
for
40
years
it
has
subjected
itself...
the
tax
has
been
subject
to
future
interest
as
well.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
one
can
always
read
things
differently,
but
it
seems--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
can't
answer
that
question
because
of
the
paucity
of
cases.
i
suppose
that
it
became
perfectly,
absolutely
clear
with
authority
when
the
tax
court
decided
the
keinath
case
because
that
was
the
first
case
that
really
dealt
with
the
disclaimers.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
words--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
perhaps
the
paucity
of
litigation
suggests
that
people
were
disclaiming
within
a
reasonable
time
and,
you
know,
there
just
weren't
any
cases.
i
would
simply
say
that
the
words--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--absolutely
not.
i
would
simply
say
that
the
words
"within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
"
means
that,
you
know,
that
when
you
are
the
beneficiary
under
a
will
that
knowledge
of
that
transfer
means
the
transfer
that
is
effected
by
that
will
and
not
getting
checks
in
the
mail.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
really
almost
is
beyond
quarrel.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
keinath?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no.
it
simply...
but
it
rendered
the
federal
timeliness
requirement
superfluous
by
the
way
by
simply
saying
that
we
look
to
state
law,
which
of
course
no
one
quarreled
about
there
or
here,
and
then...
to
consider
what
was
timely
under
federal
crime.
and
i
would
simply
say
that
33
years
or
indeed
even
24
years
is
not
a
reasonable
time
within,
you
know...
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
playing
those
options
is
exactly
the
kind
of
process
and
the
kind
of
act
that
is
the
essence
of
the
taxable
gift
under
the
gift
tax.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suppose,
you
know,
when
things
become
perfectly
clear
is
in
part
when
decisions
get
rendered
in
litigation,
and
also
there
is
war
of...
i
think,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you're
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
certain
things
are
perfectly
clear
to
tax
lawyers
even
without
the
benefit
of
decisions
or
rulings
or
regulations.
