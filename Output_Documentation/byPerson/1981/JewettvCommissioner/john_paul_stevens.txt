justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
is
a
tax
case,
jewett
against
internal
revenue
that
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
in
final
analysis.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
has
correctly
interpreted
a
gift
tax
regulation
that
has
been
on
the
book
since
1958.
the
regulation
deals
with
the
subject
of
indirect
gifts
and
in
this
particular
case,
a
trust
beneficiary
who
is
given
a
contingent
remainder
in
a
very
large
trust
to
state
some
33
years
after
the
death
of
the
testator,
the
person
who
created
the
trust
decided
to
refuse
to
accept
the
benefits
under
the
trust
and
as
a
consequence
to
that
refusal,
the
person
next
in
interest
under
the
trust
instrument
would
acquire
ownership
of
the
property
and
the
question
is
whether
this
is
an
indirect
gift,
subject
to
tax
within
the
meaning
of
the
internal
revenue
code
in
the
implementing
regulations.
the
question
actually
turns
on
when
one
must
--
when
the
time
from
which
the
disclaimer
must
be
must
be
made
runs
as
the
dated
death
when
the
trust
was
created
or
is
it
the
time
when
the
interest
would
become
possessory
in
the
ends
of
the
taxpayer.
and
we
called
for
reasons
stated
and
opinion
field
with
the
clerk
but
the
relevant
date
is
the
time
when
the
trust
instrument
was
created
and
that
therefore,
the
disclaimer
here
did
not
--
was
not
made
within
a
reasonable
time
within
the
reasonable
time
within
the
meaning
of
regulation
and
was
therefore
subject
to
test
and
on
that,
with
respect
to
that
holding,
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
o'connor.
