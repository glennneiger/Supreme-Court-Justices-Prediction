unknown
speaker
mr.
st.
clair,
it
isn't
important
at
all,
but
i'm
interested.
why
two
disclaimers?
why
not
one?
unknown
speaker
did
that
indicate
a
tenacious
desire
to
hold
on
a
little
bit
or
something?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
he
was
holding
on
only
to
the
tailfeathers
of
that
fund,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question,
if
i
may.
unknown
speaker
who
will
take
the
property?
unknown
speaker
who
will
be
the
beneficiary
of
the
disclaimer?
unknown
speaker
is
the
effect
of
the
disclaimer
to
treat
your
client
as
though
your
client
had
died
before
the
life
tenant
did?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
legal--
unknown
speaker
--one
other
question,
if
i
may.
is
the
gift
tax
always
payable
by
the
donor,
or
is
it
ever
payable
by
a
donee?
unknown
speaker
supposing
you
had
say
a
religious
person
who
took
a
vow
of
poverty
and
disclaimed.
would
the
gift
tax
be
chargeable
to
the
donees,
and
if
so,
who
would
pay
it?
unknown
speaker
but
assume
the
government's
right.
unknown
speaker
certainly
there
have
been
cases
where
the
donee
has
been
collected
from.
unknown
speaker
they're
rare.
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
mr.
st.
clair.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
itself
of
course
is
broad
and
general.
unknown
speaker
and
your
case
depends
necessarily
on
the
regulation.
unknown
speaker
if
it
weren't
for
the
regulation,
you'd
be
in
a
much
harder
predicament
and
more
difficult
predicament,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
my
question
would
have
been
isn't
the
regulation
an
act
of
grace
to
you
really?
unknown
speaker
i
say
isn't
the
regulation
an
act
of
grace
for
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
disclaim
it.
you
just
have
to
pay
gift
tax.
unknown
speaker
could
a
guardian
have
disclaimed
for
him
validly?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
a
guardian
was
appointed
by
someone.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
the
tax
court
has
been
so
tenacious
in
its
position
in
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
first
tax
court
case
rested
on
fuller.
unknown
speaker
fuller
is
distinguishable?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
depend
on
whether
the
word
"property"
refers
to
the
contingent
interest
or
to
the
assets
that
are
transferred?
unknown
speaker
let
me
interrupt
you
again,
if
i
may,
just
to
get
your
thinking.
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
the
contingent
remainder
was
never
the
decedent's
property.
that's
a
legal
interest
that
was
never
the
property
of
the
decedent.
unknown
speaker
created
by
the
decedent's
will.
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
couldn't
be
an
assignment
unless
you
had
an
identifiable
assignee.
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
it
been
clear
that
the
commissioner
gives
this
particular
construction
to
his
regulation?
unknown
speaker
but
were
there
ever
any
interpretive
statements?
when
was
the
regulation
issued?
unknown
speaker
was
it
just
assumed
up
until
relatively
recently
that
it
meant
what
you
say
it
meant?
unknown
speaker
from
the
very
start
what
was
his
view?
unknown
speaker
from
the
very
start.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
an
interpretation
of
his
own
regulation.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
suggest
that
the
regulation,
if
interpreted
the
way
he
says
it
is,
is
invalid
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
been
invalid
under
the
statutes?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
had
said
expressly
what
he
now
says
it
says.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
at
the
time
would
that
have
been
an
acceptable
construction
of
the
statute,
to
expressly--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
lawful
construction.
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
expressly
said
what
they
say
it
says
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
you're
saying
is
that
you
had
a
vested
right
then
not
to
disclaim,
and
you
could
wait
to
disclaim
as
long
as
you
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
wait
to
disclaim
until
just
before
your
mother
died.
you
could
wait
at
least
as
many
years
as
you
did
here.
unknown
speaker
after
the
regulation
came
into
effect.
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
knew
that
the
commissioner
was
construing
it
the
way
he
now
construes
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
correct,
mr.
st.
clair,
would
you
say
that
congress
by
legislation
cut
back
on
the
commissioner's
interpretation
prior
to
1976?
unknown
speaker
was
that
provision
made
a
catch
to
this
particular
provision?
unknown
speaker
the
prospectivity,
was
it--
unknown
speaker
--how
many
subjects
did
the
statute
cover?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's
got
more
authority
then
than
any
other
congressional
opinion
about
what
a
past
statute
means?
unknown
speaker
you're
arguing
more
than
that.
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
congress
has
specifically
decreed
that
on
old
cases,
on
prior
cases
the
rule
the
government
is
contending
for
will
not
be
applied.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
lot
more
than
ordinary--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you're
arguing
that
this
is
corrective
legislation
and
that
that
has
a
different
status
and
posture
from
ordinary
post-legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
but
it
certainly--
unknown
speaker
--it
certainly
has
happened
an
awful
lot
around
where
congress
passes
a
statute
that
confirms
an
agency's
view
of
the
law
although
is
quite
contentious;
and
we
still
have
to
decide
what
the
old
law
meant,
and
it
can
end
up
and
mean
exactly
what
the
congress
thought
it
meant.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
you
can
explain
the
prospective
application
of
the
statute
just
by
the
fact
they
wanted
the
nine
months
rule
to
be
prospective.
wouldn't
that
be
a
sufficient
explanation?
unknown
speaker
but
they
also
use
the
word
"transfer"
to
refer
to
the
creation
of
the
interest.
they
talk
about
transfer
creating
an
interest,
and
your
argument
is
"transfer"
refers
to
the
transfer
of
assets
rather
than
creation
of
a
contingent
remainderman.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
statute
the
word
"transfer"
quite
clearly
would
refer
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--at
least
you
have
judge
harris
below
agreeing
with
you,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
judge
harris
comes
out
of
the
eight
circuit,
too.
unknown
speaker
to
what
did
the
act
apply?
unknown
speaker
to
what
kind
of
gifts
did
the
act
apply?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
disclaimers.
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
was
prospective
only.
prospective
from
when?
unknown
speaker
is
this
indirect
gift
to
an
identifiable
person
or
to
a
class?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
do
you
think
that
the
drafters
of
the
1958
regulations
actually
meant
to
establish
a
new
federal
standard
of
reasonable
time
beginning
the
moment
the
interest
was
created?
the
history
seems
to
indicate
that
the
drafters
only
meant
to
codify
the
brown-hardenbergh
rule
which
really
left
it
up
to
state
law
to
determine
the
federal
tax.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
left
it
up
to
state
law
to
determine
the
federal
tax
consequence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
of
course
you
don't
know
why,
i
suppose,
the
solicitor
general
did
not
seek
cert
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
you'd
rather
win
one
before
you
try
to
come
here.
unknown
speaker
you
like
to
come
here
on
the
bottom
side,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
the
1976
tax
revision
legislation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
it
in
effect
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
keinath.
unknown
speaker
did
the
'76
law
also
deal
with
becoming
mature,
becoming
of
age?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wouldn't
apply
here,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
do
i
gather,
mr.
smith,
that
your
feeling
is
that...
your
submission
is,
in
any
event,
that
all
that
the
1976
act
in
making
it
prospective
intended
to
do
was
to
say
that
it
may
be
that
more
than
nine
months
would
be
a
reasonable
time
as
to
transfers
that
were
made
before
1976?
unknown
speaker
and
that
that's
the
only
reason
for
the
prospective--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
any
legislative
history
which
supports
that
suggestion
as
the
reason
why
it
was
made
prospective?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
let
me
ask
a
question
i
was
pursuing
very
shallowly
with
mr.
st.
clair.
the
tax
court
opinion
in
keinath
was
not
reviewed
by
the
court.
it
was
one
by
judge
irwin
who
relied
rather
firmly
on
the
earlier
tax
court
case
in
fuller.
do
you
agree
fuller
is
distinguishable?
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
use
and
benefit
of
income--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
it
was
here,
but
it
was
not
in
keinath.
unknown
speaker
i
get
the
feeling
that
judge
irwin
in
keinath
relied
on
rather
unsure
precedent
when
he
relied
on
fuller.
unknown
speaker
but
having
established
that
the
tax
court
had
been
persistent
all
the
way
through
the
years
on
what
seems
to
me
to
be
somewhat
of
an
unsure
foundation
in
fuller--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
smith,
isn't
there
more...
i
have
to
confess
it's
an
awfully
close
question...
but
isn't
there
more
to
your
opponent's
argument,
when
he
points
out
the
words
"transfer
to
him
of
ownership
of
a
decedent's
property
within
a
reasonable
time
after
learning
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
"
and
that
that
language
was
adopted
instead
of
the
language
"within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
interest?
"
i
mean
"existence
of
the
interest"
would
clearly
have
covered
a
contingent
remainder.
unknown
speaker
decedent's
property.
unknown
speaker
ownership
of
a
decedent's
property?
the
decedent
never
owned
a
contingent
remainder.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i
mean
conceding
that
a
future
interest
is
property,
let
me
go
back
with
you
again
to
the
brown
case
because
i
think
it's
crucial
here.
the
1958
regulation
appears
to
have
been
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
adopting
the
brown-hardenbergh
decisions,
and
when
i
asked
you
about
those
cases,
you
rather
passed
over
them
and
said
they
didn't
control.
now,
i
want
to
read
you
some
language
from
the
brown
decision
which
apparently
the
regulation
intended
to
adopt.
"the
brown
case
established
that
the
federal
tax
on
transfers
is
levied
on
the
transfer
of
property,
not
on
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
renounce
testamentary
gifts.
"
now,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
that
language
and
then
say
that
the
regulation
was
adopted
to
put
that
into
place,
that
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
tax
law
applicable
to
this
particular
case
is
as
the
petitioner
says,
even
though
congress
closed
the
loophole,
if
you
will,
in
1976.
now,
would
you
comment
more
specifically
on
brown?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
a
testamentary
gift--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
brown
case
would
say
the
transfer
didn't
occur,
and
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
let
me
get
back
to
where
i
was
in
the
fuller-keinath,
this
case
in
the
tax
court.
unknown
speaker
you
gave
me
your
answer.
you
can
make
the
same
argument,
or
rather
the
eighth
circuit
can
make
the
same
argument
on
its
side,
can't
it,
because
they
had
cottrell
come
along
after
the
tax
court
unanimous
opinion
here.
unknown
speaker
they
heard
it
en
banc.
there
were
three
dissenting
votes,
but
they
adhered
just
as
tenaciously
to
their
point
of
view
as
the
tax
court
has
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
so
your
explanation,
if
it's
good
for
the
tax
court,
it's
not
good
for
the
eighth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
eighth
circuit
decided
against
you,
and
cert
was
not
applied
for
for
obvious
reasons.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
when
was
it
first
made
as
clear
as
can
be
that
the
regulation
means
or
meant
what
you
now
say
it
means?
from
the
very
time
it
was
issued?
do
you
think
that's
the
only
possible
reading
of
the
regulation
is
the
reading
you
give
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
you've
answered
my
question
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
the
first
part
of
my
question
was
when
did
it
become
perfectly
clear
that
the
commissioner
administered
the
regulation
the
way
he
is
now
administering
it?
unknown
speaker
that
case
got
to
the
tax
court.
it
certainly
had
the
seeds
long
before
that.
unknown
speaker
at
least
the
commissioner
didn't
change
his
mind.
unknown
speaker
was
it
ever
claimed
in...
what's
the
eight
circuit's
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
suggest
that
the
regulation,
if
construed
the
way
the
commissioner
construes
it,
is
invalid
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
played
his
options
for
24
years.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
partial
response
to
justice
white,
keinath
was
decided
by
judge
irwin
only
in
1972.
that
isn't
very
long
ago.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
