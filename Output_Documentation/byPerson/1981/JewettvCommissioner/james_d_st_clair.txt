mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court:
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
is
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court
affirming
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
sustaining
assessments
of
deficiencies
in
gift
taxes.
the
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
effective
disclaimers
of
bequests
can
be
made
by
a
contingent
remainderman
under
a
testamentary
trust
where
the
life
estates
that
precede
the
contingent
remainderman's
interest
still
exist
free
of
federal
gift
tax
liability.
the
facts
are
simple
and
not
in
dispute.
my
client,
the
taxpayer's,
grandmother
died
in
1939
leaving
a
will.
the
will
provided
that
the
bulk
of
her
estate
would
be
left
in
trust
with
life
estates
to
her
husband,
her
son,
and
her
son's
wife...
the
son
and
the
wife
being
the
father
and
mother
of
my
client.
both
the
husband
of
the
settlor
and
my
client's
father
have
died
and
died
before
the
disclaimers
in
this
case
were
executed.
however,
my
client's
mother
still
lives
and
is
the
remaining
life
beneficiary
under
the
testatrix
will.
the
will,
as
i
may
have
said,
was
filed
in
probate
in
massachusetts
and
was
allowed
in
1939.
i
should
note
also
that
at
that
time
the
taxpayer
was
12
years
old.
in
1972
at
a
time
in
which
the
taxpayer
was
45
years
old
by
two
separate
disclaimers,
which
are
admittedly
valid
and
effective
under
state
law,
he
disclaimed
his
entire
interest
with
the
contingent
remainderman
under
his
grandmother's
will.
and
it
is
agreed,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
had
no
interest
thereunder
after
1972.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
don't
know
why,
but
apparently
that
can
be
done.
the
first
disclaimer
was
for
95
percent
of
his
50
percent
interest
under
his
grandmother's
will,
and
the
second
one
followed
a
few
months
later
within
the
same
taxable
year
for
the
remaining
five
percent.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
all
i
do
know
is
that
within
the
period
of
a
few
months
he
completely
disposed
of
is
interest
by
disclaimer
and
that
those
disclaimers
even
though
partial
were
valid
and
effective
under
state
law.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed,
indeed.
as
i
said,
at
that
time
he
was
45
years
old.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
one
of
my
principal
arguments
is
we
don't
now
know.
all
of
the
interests
following
the
life
estate
are
contingent
upon
survival
of
the
mother
in
this
case,
all
of
the
interests...
not
only
my
clients
but
my
clients'
issues'
interest
are
contingent
upon
their
survival.
under
the
will
there
are
gifts
over
to
collateral
heirs
in
the
event
my
client's
line
runs
out
before
the
life
tenant
dies,
and
even
those
interests
must
survive
to
take.
the
ultimate
disposition
is
in
the
dissent
and
distribution
laws.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed,
indeed.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
he
drops
out.
and
the
traditional
law
of
disclaimer
is,
and
i
think
uniformly
followed
among
all
of
the
states,
is
precisely
that.
a
disclaimer
is
not
a
conveyance.
it
is
as
if
the
person
died
with
respect
to
that
interest,
and
the
property
flows
along
as
if
it
had
never
existed.
for
example,
take
a
charitable
gift,
assuming
there
is
an
intervening
estate
that
is
disclaimed.
the
charitable
gift
is
treated
as
a
deduction
from
the
original
donor
simply
as
if
the
intervening
estate
had
never
existed.
and
there
are
other
examples
to
carry
on
that
same
theory.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
think
that
the
primary
liability
is
surely
on
the
donor.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
of
course
we
would
say
there
would
be
no
gift.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
then
the
government
may
or
may
not...
and
i
don't
know
the
answer...
have
a
right
to
trace
the
assets
through
the
donee
of
the
gift
and
attempt
to
collect
the
tax.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
yes,
indeed.
and
i
think
it's
through
the
tracing
of
assets
theory.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
problem
is
not
facing
us
in
this
case.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed.
in
fact,
so
does
the
government's
case.
this
case
revolves
around
the
proper
application
of
regulation
25.2511-1(c).
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
don't
think
so.
and
of
course
i
would
like
first
to
look
at
the
express
language
of
the
regulation
in
the
context
of
the
law
as
it
existed
when
the
regulation
was
promulgated,
and
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
persuade
you
that
the
language
itself
of
the
regulation
makes
it
quite
clear
in
this
context
that
my
client
had
a
right
to
disclaim
without
gift
tax
liability.
first
of
all--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
not
as
my
brothers
are
interpreting
it.
it's
a
lodestone
around
our
neck.
as
the
government
interprets
this,
there
is
no
way
we
could
possibly
have
disclaimed
our
interest
because
of
the
timing
of
events.
for
example,
in
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--indeed.
when
i
say
we
can
disclaim
without
the
liability
of
gift
tax.
when
the
will
was
probated,
my
client
was
12
years
old,
a
fact
which
incidentally
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
overlook
entirely
when
they
held
that
the
period
beyond
which
you
cannot
disclaim
commenced
33
years
ago.
they
in
effect
held
that
my
client
had
a
duty
at
the
age
of
12
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
or
not
to
disclaim
and
to
have
knowledge
of
the
transfer
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
if
he
had
any
reason
to
have
a
guardian.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
would
assume
that
if
a
guardian
had
been
appointed,
a
guardian
could
exercise
this
right
for
me;
but
it's
not
everyone
who's
12
years
old
that
necessarily
feels
the
necessity
for
a
guardian.
and
even
the
government
in
its
brief
alludes
to
the
proposition
that
maybe
the
period
of
time
beyond
which
a
tax-free
disclaimer
could
be
effected
began
at
the
tender
age
of
21.
well,
even
that
period
of
time
i
think
was
six...
well,
that
would
be
'48
to
'58
would
be
ten
years
before
the
promulgation
of
this
regulation,
and
that
clearly
would
have
been
an
unreasonable
time.
so
that
if
the
government's
contention
is
correct
under
any
basis,
there
is
no
way
that
we
would
have
executed
a
valid
and
binding
disclaimer
and
be
free
of
tax.
and
yet,
it
would
not
be
hard
to
establish
a
whole
series
of
other
circumstances
where
other
people
could
well
have
done
so.
and
at
one
point
in
my
argument
i'm
going
to
comment
upon
the
unfairness
and
illogical
results
of
the
government's
contention.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
the
quick
answer
is
i
don't
know.
clearly,
they
are
tenacious.
judge
rahm
in
his
opinion
simply
disregarded
outstanding
law
in
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
keinath
case,
which
is
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
that
i
presume
brings
the
case
here.
it's
simply
disregarded.
and
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
essentially
disregarded
it
except
it
says
we
disagree,
and
it
didn't
give
much
other
reasoning
behind
their
decision.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed.
i
think
it's
important
to
an
understanding
of
this
case
before
we
get
to
the
precise
provisions
of
the
regulation
itself
which
really
govern
the
outcome
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
legal
context
that
was
in
existence
when
this
regulation
was
promulgated
in
1958.
at
that
time
it
was
quite
clear
that
valid
and
effective
disclaimers
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
if
you
will,
did
not
affect
a
gift
along
the
lines
that
you
and
i
discussed,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
case
that
decided
that
is
the
brown
against
routzahn,
and
that
was
an
old
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
ohio,
and
had
been
followed,
to
the
extent
that
these
cases
had
been
decided,
i
think
without
any
exception
except
one,
the
hardenbergh
case,
again
in
the
eighth
circuit.
in
hardenbergh
there
was
an
intestacy,
and
under
the
law
of
the
state
an
intestacy
automatically
vested
title
to
the
bequest
in
the
hands
of
the
beneficiary.
there
was
nothing
you
could
do
about
it.
it
happened
as
a
matter
of
law.
under
those
circumstances
the
eighth
circuit
said
well,
a
disclaimer
cannot
be
made
under
these
circumstances
because
you
can't
avoid
obtaining
title
to
the
property;
the
law
gives
it
to
you.
and
any
disposition
of
it
is
subject
to
tax.
that
was
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time
this
was
promulgated.
the
regulation
itself
by
its
provisions
makes
it
quite
clear
that
what
was
intended
to
be
done
was
to
codify
this
common
law
as
it
related
to
disclaimers
insofar
as
the
internal
revenue
act
of
1954
was
concerned.
and
in
fact
there
has
been
recently
released
a
technical
memorandum
to
that
effect
making
it
explicitly
clear
that
that
was
the
intent
of
the
internal
revenue
service
in
advising
the
treasury
of
the
recommendation
for
the
adoption
of
this
regulation
1211-1(c).
the
common
law
also,
without
exception,
treated
the
beginning
of
the
period
beyond
which
a
disclaimer
could
not
be
effected
as
being
the
point
where
the
contingent
remainderman
in
this
case
first
obtained
ownership
of
the
property;
that
is,
once
it
became
vested
fully
it
became
then
his
property,
and
the
time
under
state
law
within
which
it
could
thereafter
be
disclaimed
began
to
run.
and
that
whole
body
of
law,
we
submit,
was
embodied
in
this
attempt
to
codify
the
law,
with
one
exception;
and
that
is,
as
the
keinath
court
pointed
out,
the
regulation
intended
to
install
a
common
period
of
time.
the
duration
of
the
period
of
time
was
to
be
a
reasonable
period
beyond
the
date
of
transfer,
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
this
is
not
the
commencement
of
the
time.
it
is
the
duration
of
the
time
that
was
said
to
be
layered
over,
if
you
will,
by
the
internal
revenue
service;
and
we
don't
contest
that
at
all.
in
fact,
we
quite
readily
recognize
the
internal
revenue
service
can
adopt
for
federal
tax
purposes
a
different
period
of
time
than
perhaps
the
various
states
have
done.
now,
with
that
understanding
of
what
the
context
of
the
law
was,
i
would
like
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
language
itself
of
the
regulation
in
an
effort
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
it,
in
effect,
in
express
terms
provides
that
the
time
beyond
which
my
client
could
not
effectively
disclaim
his
interest
without
incurring
a
federal
gift
tax
liability
commences
upon
the
date
when
he,
if
he
ever
does,
obtains
the
full
quality
and
quantity
of
vested
ownership
in
the
property;
that
is,
if
he
survives
the
life
tenant.
the
full
text
is
set
forth
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
appendix
at
page
30,
and
i
will
make
only
brief
references
to
the
precise
language,
if
i
may.
the
critical
point
reads
as
follows:
"a
refusal
to
accept
ownership
does
not
constitute
the
making
of
a
gift
if
the
refusal
is
made
within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
"
now
the
question
is
well,
what
is
the
transfer
that
initiates
this
time
period?
well,
there
are
in
fact
two
transfers
referred
to
in
the
regulation.
the
first
is,
just
briefly
above
that,
is
a
transfer
or
rather
a
refusal
to
accept
ownership
of
property
transferred
from
a
decedent.
so
that
in
one
aspect
the
transfer
has
to
be
the
transfer
of
the
property
from
the
decedent
without
any
retained
interest
or
without
any
rights
of
revocation
or
the
like;
and
that
is
accomplished
in
this
case.
the
second
reference
is
further
down,
and
there
it
says,
"if
a
person
fails
to
refuse
to
accept
a
transfer
to
him.
"
--note
"transfer
to
him"...
"of
ownership
of
a
decedent's
property
within
a
reasonable
time
after
learning
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer,
he
will
be
presumed
to
have
accepted
the
property.
"
now
we
know
that
the
transfer
must
be
first
from
the
settlor
and
also
must
be
to
the
person
who
is
disclaiming.
that
second
step
has
not
yet
happened
and
had
not
yet
happened
in
1972,
because
at
that
time
he
had
only
a
contingent
interest
dependent
upon
his
ability
to
survive
his
mother.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
it
says
"ownership
of
decedent's
property".
now,
at
one
time
this
regulation
in
its
early
drafting
had
the
word,
instead
of
"transfer",
it
had
"the
existence
of
the
interest",
and
"the
interest"
was
changed
to
the
word
"transfer".
and
i
suggest
for
the
very
purpose
of
making
it
clear
that
no
period
of
time
starts
running
under
this
regulation
until
the
contingent
remainderman
has
received
ownership
of
the
property
by
a
conveyance
to
him.
now,
this
goes
further.
this
analysis
goes
further
than
the
eighth
circuit
analysis
in
keinath.
they
said
well,
we
cannot--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--it
is
an
interest
in
the
decedent's
property,
but
the
regulation
speaks
of
ownership.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
and
doesn't
say
partial
ownership
or
interest
in
the
property.
it
says
"ownership
of
the
decedent's
property".
and
i
suggest
to
you
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
is
that
"ownership
of
property"
means
just
that.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
live
until
your
mother
dies
to
get
it,
and
not
only
that,
your
issue
have
to
live
before
your
mother
dies
to
get
it.
my
brothers
would
like
to
suggest,
your
honor,
well,
this
disclaimer
is
nothing
but
a
device
to
transfer
this
property
from
my
client
to
my
client's
issue.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
we
don't
know
for
sure
who's
going
to
be
around
when
my
client's
mother
passes
away,
if
anyone.
and
even
if
we
did,
it
wouldn't
go
to
them
because
of
anything
we
did.
it's
because
grandmother
decided
it
would
be
that
way.
the
government
further
contends
well,
this
is
simply
an
assignment
of
this
contingent
remainder.
well,
of
course,
it
isn't
an
assignment.
if
it
were
an
assignment,
the
taxpayer
could
direct
persons
to
whomever
he
determines
should
have
this
contingent
interest.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
yes.
it
could
be
one
of
the
persons
who
would
otherwise
get
it,
or
it
could
be
somebody
else.
but
even
more
importantly,
there
is
another
section
of
the
regulations,
2511-1(h)(6),
which
deals
with
assignments
of
such
interests.
and
as
the
court
in
keinath
pointed
out,
if
2511-1(c)
covers
assignments,
then
(h)(6)
is
superfluous.
of
course,
these
things
must
be
read
together
in
pari
materia
and
so
forth.
as
i
was
saying,
the
keinath
court
went
a
little
different
route.
happily,
they
came
out
the
same
place.
they
said
look,
we
can't
find
any
specific
reference
in
this
regulation
as
to
when
this
time
period
starts.
we
know
how
long
it
runs,
but
we
don't
know
when
it
starts.
and
since
the
regulation
doesn't
tell
us
anything
about
it...
and
we
disagree
on
that
point,
as
you
know...
we
will
look
to
state
law
to
determine
when
the
time
for
disclaimers,
valid
disclaimers
starts;
and
we
find,
without
exception,
that
it
starts
when
the
interest
becomes
fully
vested
in
the
beneficiary.
the
facts
with
respect
to
that
finding
are
even
more
so
true
today.
more
than
i
think
35
states
have
addressed
the
issue
of
the
commencement
of
a
period
for
a
valid
exercise
of
the
right
to
disclaim
under
state
law,
and
they
all
say
when
the
contingent
remainderman
becomes
fully
vested.
not
only
that,
but
the
various
uniform
laws
of
disclaimer
and
uniform
probate
practice
laws
all
make
the
same
provision.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
i
think
that
in
keinath
that
he
made
that
argument
in
the
tax
court,
and
keinath
overruled
it.
he
again
repeated
the
argument
in
the
tax
court
in
this
case,
and
the
ninth
circuit
sustained
it.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
1958,
november,
made
effective
as
of
the
revenue
act
of
1954.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
not
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
think
the
commissioner
as
far
as
litigated
cases
are
concerned--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--has
at
least
been
consistent.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
no,
i
don't
say
it's
invalid
under
any
means,
i
just
say
that
their
interpretation...
may
i
take
that
back?
i
would
like
to
take
it
back
in
this
context.
it's
not
invalid
qua
regulation.
it's
within
the
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
treasury
department.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
in
fact,
the
point
i
hesitate
in
saying
it
would
be
invalid
is
congress
in
1976,
in
the
tax
reform
act
of
1976
effectively
did
what
they
interpret
this
regulation
to
do.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
it
would
have
been
a
lawful
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
illogical--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--i
don't
contest
that.
it
would
have
been
illogical.
it
would
have
placed
undue
harm,
in
my
view,
on
the
taxpayer.
and
under
section
7805,
i
guess,
subsection
b,
i
suggest
that
the
commissioner
would
have
a
responsibility
under
those
circumstances,
in
effect
changing
the
existing
law,
in
effect
imposing
a
significant
hardship
on
my
client
and
others
similarly
situated,
to
make
it
only
prospective
in
its
operation.
and
he
has
the
power
to
do
that
under
7805(b).
he
should
have
done
it,
and
his
failure
to
do
it
is
judicially
reviewable.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
not
as
long
as
we
wanted
to.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
oh,
indeed.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
indeed.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
we
knew
that
the
commissioner
was
construing
it
that
way
if
you
read
the
tax
court
opinions,
but
the
keinath
case,
the
keinath
case
in
1973
said
the
commissioner
was
wrong.
the
next
time
the
matter
is
definitively
dealt
with
by
any
appellate
courts
is
this
case.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
disclaimer
cases,
i
have
found,
don't
arise
every
day
in
the
week.
they,
however,
are
becoming,
i
understand,
a
little
more
popular.
now,
i
have
mentioned
that
in
1976
the
congress
addressed
this
question,
and
the
congress
in
the
tax
reform
act
of
1976
made
expressly
the
provisions
that
my
brothers
argue
for
are
contained
in
this
regulation,
namely
that
any
disclaimer
must
be
made
within...
they
didn't
say
a
reasonable
time;
they
said
nine
months.
and
that's
the
only
difference
between
the
two
positions.
within
nine
months
of
the
creation
of
the
interest.
that
is,
in
1933
my
client
would
have
had
nine
months
within
which
to
exercise...
to
disclaim
this
gift
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
he
was
12
years
old.
the
1976
act
says
as
a
second
alternative
if,
however,
the
holder
of
the
interest
is
a
minor,
then
we
will
wait
until
nine
months
beyond
the
time
he
becomes
21,
but
he
must
do
it
then.
and
that's
just
what
the
government
is
now
arguing
is
the
meaning
of
the
1958
regulation.
the
critical
point
is,
though,
that
the
1976
act
expressly
made
it
prospective
in
application
only
to
interest
created
after
1976.
and
the
congressional,
the
house
reports
make
it
clear
that
the
congress
now,
not
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
but
that
the
congress
intended
the
prior
law
to
govern
all
transactions
regarding
interest
created
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
yes.
if
at
no
point
in
making
it
prospective
only
if
the
regulation
meant
what
the
commissioner
now
says
it
means.
that
would
be
superfluous
in
itself.
what
they're
trying
to
do
and
what
the
effects
of
a
decision
sustaining
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
be
would
be
to
abrogate
that
portion
of
the
act
of
congress
which
says
that
this
provision
will
be
applicable
only
in
the
future.
if
the
regulation
is
construed
as
the
commissioner
now
urges,
it
would
in
effect
abrogate
that
congressional
provision.
and
i
suggest
to
you...
and
the
reason
i
hesitated,
mr.
justice
white,
in
saying
it
would
be
lawful
or
unlawful,
was
that
i
think
it
is
unlawful
in
the
light
of
those
circumstances
because
it
contravenes
an
act
of
congress
in
which
the
1976
act
was
made
prospective
only,
and
this
is
explicitly
so.
because
if
they
are
right,
they
are
making
it
retroactively
applicable
in
contravention
of
the
act
of
congress.
i
think
in
substance
i
would--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
it
was
an
explicit
provision
within
the
statute
itself.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
the
tax
reform
act
of
1976,
a
lot
of
them.
but
it's
no
question
it
was
a
deliberate
act
in
effect
obviously
to
change
the
previous
law.
and
in
the
committee
reports
it
is
clear
that
they
intend
to
change
the
previous
law,
and
they
say
so;
and
they
cite,
for
example,
the
keinath
case
as
the
existing
law,
and
they
didn't
like
it,
so
they
decided
we're
going
to
enact
legislation
to
change
the
keinath
law.
and
that
is
set
forth
in
our
briefs
in
the
committee
report
itself.
so
there
could
be
no
question
but
this
was
not
an
accident
on
the
part
of
congress.
this
was
a
deliberate
act
to
change
what
it
understood
the
law
to
be
up
until
that
time,
namely
as
embodied
in
keinath.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
think
it
has
all
the
authority
that
any
legislative
history
has
with
respect
to
legislation.
surely
it
explains
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
indeed
so
argue,
and
i
am
here
arguing
that--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--i'm
here
arguing
at
least
it
should
not
be
applied
for
the
reason
that--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--indeed.
first
of
all,
it
is
legislation;
it
is
not
a
regulation
by
any
means.
it
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
the
law
should
be
changed
to
accomplish
what
my
brothers
say
has
always
been
the
law.
those
two
thoughts
cannot
be
accommodated.
and
this
is
not
just
in
the
legislative
history,
mr.
justice
white.
i
may
have
not
made
it
clear
to
you.
it's
in
the
legislation
itself.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
there
would
be
no
point
in
making
it
effective
only--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--well,
i'm
only
arguing
that
the
congress
thought
differently
and
provided
legislation
that
contradicts,
in
effect,
the
position
now
being
taken
by
my
brother,
because
my
brother's
interpretation
would
abrogate
the
prospective
only
portion
of
the
legislation.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
no.
they
said
it's
not
only
nine
months,
but
it
starts
when
the
original
gift
is
made
or
when
the
individual
becomes
of
age;
so
they
deal
with
the
duration
and
with
the
commencement
of
the
time.
they
deal
with
the
whole
package.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
when
i
talk
about
transfer
i'm
talking
about
as
it
is
used
in
the
regulation.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
by
the
terms
of
the
regulation
itself.
"transfer"
as
an
english
word
could
mean
a
lot
of
things,
including
a
transfer
of
an
interest.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
the
original
transfer
and
any
interest
thereafter
in
the
property.
it
is
a
wide-ranging
provision
designed
to
do,
as
a
corrective
measure,
what
the
commission
now
argues
was
always
the
situation
anyway.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
it
was
only
a
majority
opinion
below,
yes.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
you
would
know,
sir,
more
about
the
eighth
circuit
perhaps
than
i
would,
except
that
i
think,
frankly,
the
eight
circuit
rationale,
although
it
is
not
perhaps
as
precise
our
analysis
of
the
regulation,
is
certainly
a
supportable
one.
the
case
is
far
better
reasoned,
with
all
due
respect,
than
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
decision
was
simply
a
denial
of
the
validity
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
created
this
conflict.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
the
new
act?
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
all,
all
interest.
any
disclaimer
of
any
interest--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--from
january
1,
1976
and
thereafter.
thank
you.
