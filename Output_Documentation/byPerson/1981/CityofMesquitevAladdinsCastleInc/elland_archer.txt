mr.
elland
archer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
playing
of
coin-operated
machines
is
a
fundamental
right.
there
are
other
questions,
of
course.
the
second
important
question
is
which
rules
of
law
are
applicable
to
adults
and
which
are
applicable
to
children.
with
your
permission,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
fundamental
right
question
first.
we
think
in
finding
a
fundamental
right
on
a
par
with
freedom
of
speech
and
religion,
right
to
travel
and
other
important
rights
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
an
extremely
broad
interpretation
of
the
term
"association".
of
course,
in
its
broadest
terms
"association"
would
encompass
all
commercial
transactions.
we
realize
that.
if
you
rent
an
automobile,
of
course,
there
may
be
some
associational
aspects.
if
you
rent
a
boat,
if
you
rent
a
motel
room,
you
may
have
guests
in.
mr.
elland
archer
yes,
yes.
what
we're
saying
is
that
you
can't
just
take
the
term
"association"
in
its
ordinary
sense
and
apply
it
as
the
association
that
is
protected
by
the
constitution.
we
feel
that
there
is
something
more
than
just
mere
physical
proximity
to
constitute
association
protected
by
the
constitution.
for
instance,
if
you
go
in
a
bank
to
make
a
loan
you're
going
to
talk
with
people,
you're
going
to
meet
friends
and
acquaintances.
when
you
go
in
the
supermarket,
when
you're
at
work,
you
have
association
with
your
fellow
workers.
but
these
are
all
matters
governed
by
the
law
of
contract.
i'd
like
to
discuss
for
just
a
moment
the
nature
of
the
transaction
that
is
regulated.
what
we
have
here
is
a
simple
rental
agreement.
generally
a
customer
pays
25
cents
for
use
of
a
machine,
generally
from
one
to
three
minutes
or
whatever
time
it
takes.
no
different
from
renting
a
lawn
mower
or
renting
a
power
saw
or
any
other
machine.
now,
if
this
type
of
transaction
is
the
association
that
is
protected
by
the
constitution
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
then
every
commercial
transaction
known
to
man
becomes
a
first
amendment
activity.
this
we
feel
will
weaken
the
values
that
have
traditionally
been
upheld
by
this
court.
going
to
the
question
of
which
rules
of
law
are
applicable
to
adults
and
which
are
applicable
to
children,
we
say
children
are
simply
not
the
same
as
adults.
we
don't
mean
to
imply
that
children
have
no
constitutional
rights.
certainly
they
do.
but
the
rights
of
children
are
not
always
the
same
as
the
rights
of
adults.
i
think
in
the
words
of
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
may
versus
anderson,
he
said
it
much
better
than
i
can:
"children
have
a
very
special
place
in
life
which
law
should
reflect.
"
"legal
theories
and
their
phrasing
in
other
cases
readily
lead
to
fallacious
reasoning
if
uncritically
transferred
to
a
determination
of
a
state's
duty
towards
children.
"
as
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
relied
upon
cases
that
are
good
cases,
but
they
are
cases
dealing
with
something
other
than
children.
they
deal
with
race,
they
deal
with
adults,
they
deal
in
suspect
areas,
they
deal
with
the
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
but
they
don't
deal
with
the
facts
at
hand.
therefore
we
feel
that
these
cases
are
inapplicable.
mr.
elland
archer
no,
i
don't
think
that's
our
position.
that
may
be
correct,
but
i
don't
know
that
that's
our
position.
i
don't
know
that
we
have
evidence
to
that
effect.
we
think
that
playing
them,
playing
the
machines
in
the
actual
setting
in
which
it
takes
place
in
many
cases
is
harmful,
not
in
every
case.
we
don't
claim
that
in
every
case
there
is
harm.
but
we
also
say
that
we
cannot
tailor
a
law
that
will
fit
every
establishment
in
town.
there's
just
no
way
it
can
be
done.
mr.
elland
archer
yes.
in
fact,
we
consider
the
age
question--
mr.
elland
archer
--the
paramount
question.
we
do
have
a
question
regarding
some
language
in
the
ordinance
and
i
don't
intend
to
waive
that--
mr.
elland
archer
--on
the
language
part?
no.
mr.
elland
archer
no,
the
state
court
has
never
reviewed
the
age
question...
or,
i'm
sorry.
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
elland
archer
oh,
i
understand.
i
thought
you
meant
the
state
court.
mr.
elland
archer
all
right.
the
provision
of
the
state
constitution
is
identical
to
the
federal
constitution.
the
words
may
be
slightly
different,
but
there's
no--
mr.
elland
archer
--well,
but
that's
not
an
independent
state
ground.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
because
it's
identical.
in
other
words,
if
a
state
adopted
a
constitution--
mr.
elland
archer
--texas
has
such
a
rule.
mr.
elland
archer
oh,
i
don't
think
they're
forbidden
to,
but
i
think
since
they
are
similar
and
since
they
were
patterned
after
the
federal
constitution--
mr.
elland
archer
--i
think
that
would
be
a
substantial
departure,
because
one
constitution
is
patterned
after
the
other
and
the
cases
construing
one
are
authorities
for
the
other,
and
that
is
the
rule
of
law
in
texas.
and
i
think
i've
covered
that
in
my
brief,
but
i
can
go
into
that
further
if
you'd
like.
mr.
elland
archer
yes.
mr.
elland
archer
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
elland
archer
i
don't
think
so,
because
again
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
was
simply
stating
that
the
two
constitutions
were
identical
and
that,
of
course,
if
it
violated
one
it
would
obviously
violate
the
other.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
again
i
don't
think
it's
an
independent
state
ground.
i
think
that
they
are
identical.
the
state
constitution
and
the
federal
constitution
mean
exactly
the
same
thing.
so
you
couldn't
have
a
federal
question
without
it
also...
i
mean,
you
couldn't
have
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
without
it
also
violating
the
state
constitution.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
jurisdictional
statute.
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
elland
archer
--oh,
no.
i
think
the
state
court
would
have
to
actually
rule
on
a
federal
question
before
it
could
come
to
this
court,
obviously.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
in
a
diversity
case,
yes.
mr.
elland
archer
yes,
this
was
a
diversity
case.
again,
the
federal
question...
the
federal
rule
of
law
involved
is
the
application
of
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
now,
that
is
not
a
state
question.
there
is
no
state
rule
of
law
to
that
effect.
the
court
of
appeals,
even
in
their
discussion
of
the
"rational
basis",
first
found
that
there
was
a
fundamental
right,
that
of
association,
and
then
reasoned
backwards
by
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
city,
saying
the
city
failed
to
produce
evidence
to
show
this
and
that.
therefore
throughout
the
opinion...
and
i
realize
that
we're
not
appealing
from
the
opinion,
we're
appealing
from
the
judgment.
but
i
think
the
judgment
is
incorrect
because
of
a
body
of
federal
law
that
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied,
not
any
state
law.
there's
no
state
law,
strict
scrutiny
test
versus
rational
basis
test
doctrine.
looking
at
the
application
of
law
to
children,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
improperly
applied
rules
of
law
pertaining
to
adults
or
to
race
and
other
matters,
instead
of
confining
it
to
children.
obviously,
children
do
not
have
all
the
rights
that
adults
have.
children
do
not
choose
their
domicile.
they
do
not
choose
the
school
they
wish
to
attend.
they
do
not
in
all
cases
choose
the
church
that
they
wish
to
attend.
and
while
this
may
be
considered
private
action,
it
is
buttressed
at
every
point
by
state
action.
for
instance,
if
a
child
refuses
to
reside
in
the
domicile
chosen
by
his
parents,
he's
treated
by
the
state
as
a
runaway.
if
he
refuses
to
attend
the
school
that
his
parents
choose,
he's
treated
as
a
truant.
if
he
refuses
to
do
the
other
things
that
his
parents
require
him
to
do,
the
state
makes
an
exception
and
allows
physical
punishment
that
wouldn't
be
permissible
for
an
adult.
of
course,
many
states
require
a
parent's
signature
for
the
issuance
of
a
driver's
license.
others
require
a
parent's
signature
for
a
minor
to
marry.
this
is
all
state
action.
of
course,
there
are
countless
other
things
in
which
the
state
buttresses
the
action
of
the
parent
in
not
allowing
the
same
rights
to
minors
as
adults.
i
think
the
failure
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
give
consideration
to
these
facts
is
what
caused
the
improper
judgment.
mr.
elland
archer
this
ordinance
itself
does
not.
this
ordinance
simply
does
not
deal
with
those
other
questions.
but
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
we
were
not
required
to
address
all
the
ills
existing
in
one
law
or
one
enactment.
i
don't
think
we
single
out
any
particular
establishment
and
say,
this
establishment
cannot
do
this
but
all
others
can.
we
just
fail
to
say
anything
about
the
others.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
yes.
the
ordinance
does
not
address
the
question
of
being
present,
but
we
don't
deny
that
denying
them
the
right
to
play
the
games
will
discourage
their
presence.
we've
never
denied
that.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
i
think
it's
twofold.
i
think
the
first
is
a
financial
impact.
i
think
the
city
fathers
feel
that
the
children
are
spending
money
on
these
games
that
they
can
ill
afford,
money
that
they
need--
mr.
elland
archer
--we
think
that
that
is
one
concern.
i
think
another
concern,
and
the
concern
that
was
emphasized
by
our
police
department,
was
some
of
the
things
that
take
place
at
these
establishments,
such
as
drug
transfers,
fights,
contacts
by
runaways.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
not
directly.
but
we
assume
they
go
there
because
they
want
to
play
the
machines.
i
don't
think
they'd
go
there
if
they
couldn't
play
the
machines,
or
not
in
any
large
number.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
no.
it's
directed
at
every
establishment
in
the
city.
mr.
elland
archer
no.
we
had
this
ordinance
in
1973,
before
we
had
ever
heard
of
aladdin's.
now,
if
they're
talking
about
the
amendment,
the
amendment
probably
affected
aladdin's
and
one
other
place
in
the
city,
funfare,
i
believe,
in
another
shopping
center.
mr.
elland
archer
yes,
that
ordinance...
there
had
been
a
previous
ordinance
that
made
an
exception
to
places
located
in
a
shopping
center.
now,
to
the
extent
that
it
closed
that
loophole,
if
you
may,
then
i
guess
it
would
be
directed
to
all
establishments
in
shopping
center
malls,
which
aladdin's
and
i
believe
one
other
at
that
time
were
the
only
ones
there.
now
there
are
several.
at
that
time
aladdin's
and
one
other
were
the
only
ones.
now,
the
age
regulation
that
we're
seeking
to
uphold
applies
to
every
establishment
in
town,
the
seven
eleven
stores
that
maybe
only
have
one
machine
and
where
there
are
no
other
customers
present,
where
there's
no
association
involved
whatsoever.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
i
think
that...
well,
of
course,
i
say
one.
you
know,
i
don't
know
that
there's
cases
where
there's
never
more
than
one
present.
mr.
elland
archer
yes.
and
that
would
be
based
more
on
the
financial
impact.
but
i
think
most
of
the
establishments
have
more
than
one
machine,
to
be
candid
with
you.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
association
involved
because
it
could
just
be
one
machine
and
it
could
just
be
one
person
present.
and
i
don't
know
how
you'd
read
association
into
that.
frankly,
i
don't
know
how
you
read
association
into
a
hundred
people
being
present
unless
they
go
there
for
a
common
purpose,
they're
acquainted
with
each
other
or
they
become
acquainted
after
they
get
there
or
something.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
unfortunately
that's
the
term
that
the
appellee
uses,
spending
25
cents.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record--
mr.
elland
archer
--right.
in
other
words,
just
like
if
you
smoke
one
cigarette
you
may
smoke
another
cigarette.
if
you
take
one
drink
you
may
take
a
lot
of
drinks.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
negated
regulation
of
miniature
golf
courses.
this
particular
ordinance
does
not.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
have
said
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
regulate
miniature
golf
courses.
i
can
see
distinctions,
and
again
the
record
is
not
as
strong
in
this
case.
we
thought
we
were
trying
it
on
the
rational
basis
question
rather
than
the
higher
level
test.
but
officers
can
drive
by
and
see
people
playing
on
the
miniature
golf
course.
they're
exposed
to
public
view
at
all
times.
i
don't
know
how
much
difference
that
makes,
but
our
police
department
says
it
makes
a
difference.
now,
that's
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know
if
i
should
even
be
saying
it.
but
those
are
some
of
the
things
that
could
have
been
in
the
record
had
we
known
that
we
would
be
held
to
this
type
of
test.
mr.
elland
archer
yes,
i
think
where
it
applies
to
just
one
machine
it
is
primarily
the
financial
impact.
but
i
think
you'll
find
in
most
cases
it'll
be
more
than
one
machine.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
places
just
have...
well,
there
may
be
a
few.
but
i
think
most
of
them
have
from
two
to
four,
you
know,
that
are
not
arcades.
mr.
elland
archer
the
state
could
under
the
holding
of
this
court,
i
believe,
in
murphy
versus
california.
the
state
has
not
seen
fit
to
do
so,
and
of
course
we're
merely
a
part
of
the
state.
and
until
we
are
given
permission
by
the
state
to
totally
outlaw
them,
i
don't
think
we
can.
the
state
has
given
us
permission
to
"regulate"
them.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
constitution
is
identical
to
the
federal
constitution,
i
guess
i'd
have
to
say
yes.
but
i
don't
think
they
indicated
that
there
was
an
independent
state
law
grounds,
but
merely
that
it
was
the
same
as
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
elland
archer
i
think
we
would
be
a
lot
closer
then
to
what
they're
saying
here.
for
one
thing,
when
they
go
into
the
park
it's
not
a
financial
transaction,
it's
not
a
business
matter.
i
think
that
that
is
more
closely
akin
to,
say,
being
on
the
streets,
a
curfew.
i
doubt
that
we
could.
i
think
we
could
regulate
our
parks
and
we
certainly
do
regulate
our
parks,
regardless
of
whether
anyone
may
say
that
we've
neglected
that
area.
but
we
do
regulate
our
parks.
i'd
like
to
speak
just
a
moment
on
the
vagueness
question.
i
think
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
read
the
language
"connections
with
criminal
elements"
in
the
context
in
which
it's
used.
mr.
elland
archer
it
has,
your
honor.
but
we
do
agree
with
appellee
that
it's
not
moot.
we
would
like
to
have
it--
mr.
elland
archer
--well,
we
would
like
to
put
it
back
in
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
allow
us
to.
mr.
elland
archer
well--
mr.
elland
archer
--well,
that
is
correct.
but
it--
mr.
elland
archer
--yes.
but
it's
only
because
we're
not
allowed
to
by
the
order
of
the
district
court,
and
then
in
turn
which
was
made
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
we
brought
it
from
the--
mr.
elland
archer
--court
of
appeals
to
here.
mr.
elland
archer
yes,
we
had
already
amended
the
ordinance
because
we
were
prohibited
from
using
it.
mr.
elland
archer
well,
yes.
but
in
the
meantime
we
would
have
other
applications
and
it
would
be
unclear
as
to
what
the
status
of
these
applications
were.
mr.
elland
archer
that
is
correct.
i
realize
we
could.
we
felt
at
the
time
that
that
was
the
best
thing
to
do.
but
as
i
say,
we
would
like
to
reinstate
it
if
this
court
should
find
either
that
the
appellee
had
no
standing
to
question
the
language
or
that
the
language
is
not
vague,
or
both.
the
reason
we
say
they
have
no
standing
in
the
context
in
which
this
is
used,
this
is
not
a
standard
upon
which
a
license
is
granted.
the
standard
upon
which
a
license
is
granted
is
good
character.
this
is
simply
a
direction
to
the
chief
of
police
as
to
how
he
is
to
gather
certain
intelligence,
no
different
from
laird
versus
tatum.
mr.
elland
archer
yes.
they
claim
that...
well,
no.
but
they
claim
because
it
is
directed
toward
the
chief
of
police
that
his
recommendation
in
turn
will
influence
the
city
manager,
which
in
turn
will
influence
the
city
council
and
the
district
court
and
ad
infinitum.
we
also
say,
of
course,
in
the
context
in
which
it's
used
it's
not
unconstitutionally
vague
because
nobody
has
to
know
what
it
means
except
the
chief
of
police,
and
he
obviously
knows
what
it
means.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my--
mr.
elland
archer
--the
home
office?
chicago.
mr.
elland
archer
thank
you.
mr.
elland
archer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
don't
agree
with
counsel's
idea
of
how
the
case
may
be
treated
as
the
only
alternatives
either
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
then
deny
certiorari
or
grant
it.
i
think
this
court
could
remand
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
clarification
as
to
whether
they
are
making
a
decision
based
upon
an
independent
state
ground
or
whether
they
consider
the
provisions
identical.
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
if
the
case
does
go
off
on
that
point,
because
even
though
you're
reviewing
a
judgment
and
not
an
opinion,
that
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
the
books.
and
that
means
that
the
cities
throughout
the
fifth
circuit
that
desire
to
have
this
type
of
ordinance,
whether
there's
any
diversity
jurisdiction
between
their
operators
in
the
city
or
not,
are
going
to
be
harmed
by
this
opinion
on
the
books,
assuming
of
course
that
you
disagree
with
it.
of
course,
if
you
agree
with
the
opinion
i
assume
that
that
would
become
the
law
of
the
land
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
which
circuit
you
were
in.
but
assuming
that
you
did
disagree
with
the
opinion
of
the
court,
but
you
felt
that
you
must
deny
certiorari,
then
as
i
say
i
don't
think
that's
the
only
alternative.
i
think
it
can
be
remanded
back
for
clarification
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
an
independent
state
ground
or
whether
it
was
just
mere
verbiage
to
the
effect
that,
yes,
the
state
constitution
is
similar
to
the
federal
constitution.
i
think
the
overriding
question
was
federal
law,
and
i
think
that's
how
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case,
based
on
the
level
of
review
to
be
accorded
this
type
of
activity.
in
other
words,
whether
it
should
be
a
rational
basis--
mr.
elland
archer
--well,
i
think
they
could
have
based
it
on
both,
all
right,
if
they--
mr.
elland
archer
--i
would
think
that
they
should,
yes.
i
think
this
court
does
that
and
i
would
think
that
the
court
of
appeals...
maybe
they're
not
required
to,
but
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
proper
disposition.
but
i
don't
think
it
was
their
intent
to
determine
that
there
was
separate
state
and
federal
law.
i
think
they
just
mentioned
that,
yes,
there--
mr.
elland
archer
--yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
would
yield
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
