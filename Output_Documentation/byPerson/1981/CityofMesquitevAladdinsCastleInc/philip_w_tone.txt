mr.
philip
w.
tone
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
first
address
the
matter
of
the
existence
of
independent
state
grounds
for
the
decision.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
age
restriction
claim
is
supported
not
only
by
the
federal
constitutional
ground,
but
by
independent
state
law
grounds.
the
court
expressly
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
texas
constitution.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
you
could
on
certiorari,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
the
problem
here
is
that
this
is
here
on
appeal
under
section
1254.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
no,
not
so
long
as
this
court--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--yes,
it's
a
jurisdictional
argument
and
it
says--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--your
honor
is
quite
right.
but
the
mechanism
by
which
you
would
reach
the
state
law
question,
i
submit,
would
be
to
dismiss
the
appeal
under
1254(2)
and
treat
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
certiorari--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--right.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
it
is
a
proper
appeal.
but
section
1254(2)
provides
specifically
that
in
such
an
appeal
the
review
on
appeal
shall
be
restricted
to
the
federal
questions
presented.
so
congress
in
1254(2)
has
prohibited
the
court
from
considering
the
state
ground.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
then
your
honors
could...
in
fact,
if
the
appeal
is
dismissed,
the
appropriate
procedure
according
to
stern
and
gressman,
and
i
think
that's
correct,
would
be
to
treat
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
certiorari
under
2103,
which
commands
the
court
to
do
that.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
well,
i
want
to
rely
on
the
state
ground,
your
honor,
because
i--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--no.
i
say
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
on
appeal.
i
say
also
that
you
do
have
jurisdiction,
if
you
choose
to
exercise
it,
to
grant
certiorari.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
adequacy
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
simply
means
that
it
is
sufficient
to
support
the
judgment
if
correct.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
reviewed
the
merits
of
the
state
ground.
the
point
i
make
is
illustrated,
if
the
court
please,
by
the
hastings
case,
in
which
chief
justice
hughes
addressed
this
very
point
in
the
context
of
a
statute
allowing
appeal
by
the
government
from
an
order
dismissing
an
indictment
where
the
indictment...
where
the
order
held
the
indictment
invalid
either
on
the
ground
of
the
invalidity
of
the
underlying
statute
or
the
construction
of
the
statute
on
which
the
indictment
was
based.
and
the
chief
justice
said
in
that
case
that
in
order
to...
that
the
court
should
first
examine
whether
there
was
an
independent
ground
for
the
order
of
the
district
court.
if
there
was
an
independent
ground
that
didn't
relate
to
either
the
validity
of
the
statute
or
the
construction
of
the
statute,
he
said
the
court
would
be
rendering
an
advisory
opinion
by
ruling
on
the
questions
that
were
appealable.
and
he
said
that
review
of
a
judgment
we
cannot
disturb
because
it
rests
on
grounds
we
cannot
examine
would
be
an
anomaly.
and
then
he
used
as
an
analogy
the
appeal
statute
which
provides
for
appeal
from
the
highest
court
of
a
state.
and
he
said
the
practice
of
this
court
with
respect
to
such
appeals
when
there
is
an
independent
state
ground
on
which
the
judgment...
which
adequately
supports
the
judgment,
is
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
do
not
think
it
has,
your
honor.
i
believe,
as
i
said,
stern
and
dressman's
position
is
consistent
with
mine,
and
i
think
that's
a
correct
reading.
it
seems
to
me
the
analysis
has
to
be
that
it
has
to
be
that
way.
we
are,
as
the
appellee...
we're
entitled
to
rely
on
whatever
state
grounds
are
available
to
support
the
judgment.
we're
entitled
to
rely
on
state
grounds
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rule
on
them.
and
yet
when
it
comes
up
here
under
1254(2)
we
would
be
precluded
from
relying
upon
state
grounds
that
support
the
judgment
because
this
court
is
not
allowed
to
examine
those
grounds
under
this
proviso
of
1254(2)
that
we've
been
talking
about.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
deny
it,
right.
yes.
your
honor
is
correct,
the
correct
disposition
in
our
view
would
be
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
to
treat
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
deny
certiorari
on
the
grounds
that
there
are
adequate
state
grounds.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
because
you
could
elect
in
your
discretion,
if
you
chose
to
do
so...
the
case
is
properly
in
the
federal
court
as
a
diversity
case.
and
this
court
has
discretion
to
review
state
questions
that
come
up
that
way
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
it
rarely
if
even
does.
but
it
would
have
authority
to
do
that
under
its
certiorari
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes,
just
deny
cert.--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--if
you
disagree
and
grant
cert,
then
i
submit
to
the
court
that
you
would
and
should
review
the
state
law
question,
because
as
respondents--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--you
would
have
power
to
do
that,
your
honor.
i
would
question,
however,
whether
that
disposition
would
be
consistent
with
the
ashwander
admonition
about
no
reaching
federal
constitutional
questions
unless
necessary
to
do
so.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
no,
there
is
no
indication
that
texas
feels
bound
to
follow
the
federal.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
state
law
and
the
federal
law--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--questions
as
independent
questions.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's
exactly
correct.
they've
already
decided
the
state
law
question.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
submit,
to
suggest
that
they
felt
that
state
law
and
federal
law
were
identical
on
these
issues.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's
correct.
we,
however,
have
cited
some
state
law
cases
in
our
brief
which
indicate
that
the
texas
courts,
although
they
phrase
the
standards
approximately
the
same
as
this
court
does
and
cite
this
court's
cases,
nevertheless
reach
results
which
i
think
this
court
would
not
reach
on
the
same
facts.
so
i
think
that
the
texas
law,
although
it
was
not
analyzed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
not
identical
with
the
federal
law,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
rule
on
that
grounds.
there
are
also,
i
might
add,
two
other
grounds
of
texas
law,
one
a
texas
common
law
ground
which
the
appellee
has
so
far
not
been
able
to
get
a
ruling
upon.
the
court
of
appeals
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
reach
these
two
other
state
law
grounds
which
we
argue
in
our
brief.
and
if
this
court
were
to
take
the
case
we
would
at
some
point
be
entitled
to
an
adjudication
on
those
grounds
which
defend
the
judgment.
and
ordinarily
we
would
be
able
to
argue
those
grounds
to
this
court
because
they
are
grounds
for
affirmance.
this
court
can
affirm
on
any
grounds
that
it
finds
supported
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's
correct.
both
were
urged
below.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
was
speaking
to
the
supposition
suggested
in
the
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position
that
the
appeal
should
be
dismissed
for
the
reasons
stated
earlier
and
treats
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
cert,
then
it
would
have...
then
it
was
on
that
basis
that
i
said,
if
the
court
takes
the
case,
my
view
is
that
the
case
should
not
be
here
on
appeal
for
the
reasons
i've
stated
previously.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
relief
we
ask
for
in
the
first
point
in
the
brief.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
then
you
do
not
have
the
power
to
listen
to
the
state
law
arguments.
but
then
i
submit
you
don't
have
power
to
decide
the
federal
question
either,
because
your
decision
would
be
an
advisory
one.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
right.
and
as
to
the
state
law
questions
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rule
on,
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
appellee
because
we
would
never
have
a
chance
to
present
those
arguments
anyway.
now
i
should
like...
although,
as
i
have
said,
it's
our
position
that
the
court
should
not
reach
the
federal
constitutional
question,
i
am
sure
the
court
does
not
want
me
to
argue
the
texas
law
points
and
so
i
think
i
should
proceed
to
discuss
the
federal
constitutional
question
as
if
it
were
to
be
reached
on
this
appeal.
and
i
shall
proceed
to
do
that.
this
court
has
recognized
that
entertainment
is
a
form
of
communication
and
expression
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
it
has
also
recognized
that
the
communication
and
expression
need
not
be
verbal
to
be
protected.
thus,
musical
compositions
and
dancing,
including
nude
dancing,
are
protected.
the
first
amendment
protects
both
the
right
to
communicate
and
the
right
to
receive
the
communication.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
do
question
that,
your
honor.
i
do
question
that.
i
think
that
these
games,
at
least,
involve
first
amendment
expression
on
the
part
of
the
author
of
the
game
and
on
the
part
of
the
player
of
the
game.
they
are
complex
electronic
devices
that
present
a
series
of
audio
and
visual
effects
through
complex
electronic
circuitry.
they
call
upon
the
player
to
respond--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--pardon?
mr.
philip
w.
tone
the
author,
your
honor--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--is
the
person
who
designs
the
electronic
circuitry.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
think
he's
more
than
a
mechanic,
if
the
court
please.
he
is...
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
broad
one's
definition
of
"mechanic"
is.
but
he
is
a
person
skilled
in
electronics
and
in
the
visual
and
the
video
arts.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
think
an
adding
machine
does
not
convey
a
message
to
anyone.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
well,
let
me
call
him
the
originator
of
the
game.
he
does
get
a
copyright
on
it.
the
federal
courts
have
uniformly
recognized
that
these
games
are
protected
by
copyright.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i'm
not
sure
about
the
adding
machine.
i
would
not
dispute
your
honor's
statement,
but
i--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--all
right.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
the
adding
machine
might
have
a
patent.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
well,
your
honor,
i
think
his
right
to
communicate
what
he
had
dreamed
up
was
protected.
their
conspiracy
was
forbidden
by
other
laws.
but
the
right
to
communicate
i
think
would
be
protected.
our
position
is
that
these
games
do
involve
communication.
they
involve
a
receipt
by
the
player
of
the
ideas
of
the
designer
of
the
game.
he
has...
the
game
responds
in
certain
ways,
in
very
complicated
ways,
to
matters
that
the
player
does.
these
are
not...
the
games
i
am
describing
now
are
not
so-called
pinball
machines,
but
those
machines
which
make
up
most
of
the
market
now,
audio-video
games,
which
are
very
complicated
affairs.
and
there
is
a
very
complicated
interrelationship
and
interaction
between
the
machine
and
the
player.
and
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
these
are
a
form
of
expression
and
communication.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
quotes
at
length
from
marshall
mcluhan.
we
have
a
small
quote
from
his
statement
about
games
being
communication.
and
he
says,
speaking
of
all
games
generally,
that
they
are
a
media
of
communication
and
that
that
should
now
be
plain.
and
as
media
of
communication,
we
submit
that
they
fall
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
like
the
composer
of
a
musical
composition
or
dance,
the
author
of
the
game
has
a
protected
right
to
present
his
creation
to
people
who
want
to
receive
it,
and
they
have
a
right
to
receive
the
expression.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that
much
is
true.
but
there
is
a
special
governmental
interest
in
regulation
of
speech
over
the
restricted
channels
available
for
radio
and
television.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
very
skimpy,
but
there
is
an
indication
that
there
is
one
other
coin-operated
game
center
in
the
city.
and
i
think
there
isn't
any
real
dispute
that--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--that's
correct.
and
a
reasonable
time
limitation
would
be
valid
here.
but
this
regulation--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--if
it
were
a
zoning
ordinance
limiting
the
places
where
commercial
establishments,
including
games,
could
be
played,
that
would
be
reasonable.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that
might
well
be
reasonable,
although
that's
somebody
else's
case
and
i
wouldn't
want
to--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--i
think
that
would
be
reasonable,
for
a
different
reason,
because
the
state
has
a
right
to
prohibit
17-year-olds
from
going
into
a
bar.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
well,
but
remember,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
fundamental
right
does
not
mean
that
the
state
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
regulate
it.
it
merely
means
that
it
must
regulate
it
only
based
upon
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
that
the
regulation
must
be
reasonably
tailored
to
protect
that
interest
and
must
not
be
unnecessarily
intrusive
on
the
fundamental
right.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
guess
that
would
be
too
broad
a
statement,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
would.
but
this
is
more
than
a
time,
place
and
manner
statement...
or
restriction
before
you
at
the
present
time.
as
to
youths
who
are
unable
to
persuade
their
parents
to
accompany
them
or
who
cannot...
whose
parents
both
work,
it's
a
flat
prohibition.
they
can't
play
the
games
at
all.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
no,
your
honor.
gambling
is
expressly
forbidden,
and
these
are
not
gambling
devices
under
texas
law.
there
is
no...
you
do
not
have
the
old
free
games
or
anything,
and
so
on.
they
are
not
gambling
devices.
and
one
could
gamble
on
the
games
only
in
the
sense
that
he
could
gamble
on
any
competitive
endeavor.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
you
could
bet
on
the
outcome,
just
as
you
could
bet
on
the
outcome
of
a
football
game
or
on
who
can
run
faster.
some
of
these
games
are
played
by
individuals
alone,
some
are
played
by
more
than
one
or
a
group
of
individuals.
so
it
is
possible
to
gamble
with
the
games,
but
that
is
not
their
purpose
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
these
games
have
been
used
for
gambling,
and
they
are
not
gambling
devices
under
texas
law,
which
does
prohibit
gambling
devices.
i
submit
that
the
only
distinction
that
can
be
made
between
these
games
and
various
other
forms
of
expression,
including
some
that
this
court
has
held
to
be
protected,
is
in
their
social
utility.
and
that
is
a
matter
of
value
judgment.
it's
easy
to
deprecate
or
ocularly
put
down
the
social
utility
of
various
forms
of
expression,
including
some
form
this
court
has
held
protected.
but
the
court
has
also
held
that
the
level
of
protection
to
be
given
any
form
of
expression
does
not
turn
on
its
importance
or
its
social
utility.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
missed
the
first
part.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
guess
i
would
not
view
that
as
rising
to
the
level
of
protected
expression.
we
also--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--that's
possible.
also--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--are
very?
mr.
philip
w.
tone
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
yes,
that's
correct,
they
are
lucrative.
that
is
to
say
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
game
collects
25
cents
for
each
play.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
have
read
those
statistics,
your
honor,
and
i
understand
them
to
be
correct.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
pardon?
it's
powerful
speech,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
well,
your
honor,
i
think
both.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
the
player
has
to
respond
to
a
great
variety
of
challenges
that
the
game
presents
which
are
invoked
by
what
the
player
does.
so
there's
an
interplay
between
this
computer-programmed
game
and
the
player.
so
it's
an
expression
by
the
designer
of
the
game
of
the
idea
of
the
game,
and
there
is
interaction
by
the
player
to
the
various,
numerous
variables
that
are
presented
by
the
game.
and
of
course,
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
game
i
suppose
is
in
a
position
analogous
to
the
movie
theater
operator.
he
too
is
in
the
stream
of
communication.
he's
the
conduit
through
which
the
communication
goes.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
it's
essentially...
your
honor
is
correct.
it's
essentially
the
same
as
the
videogame
that
you
play
on
the
television
set,
except
that
it
is
much
more
elaborate.
it's
a
heavier
and
more
durable--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--machine,
and
more
expensive,
exactly.
it's
much
more
expensive.
the
ones
that
are
sold
at
home
i
think
are
sold
on
the
order
of
a
few
hundred...
the
cost
is
a
few
hundred
dollars,
while
these
games--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--that's
correct,
that
is
correct.
we
also
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
right
of
association
is
implicated,
and
the
court...
the
case
came
here
on
the
question
stated
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
whether
there
exists
a
right
of
social
association.
that
was
the
principal
issue
stated.
i
submit
that
there
is.
this
court
has...
although
it
hasn't
ruled
on
that
point
expressly,
i
submit
that
there
ought
to
be
such
a
right,
just
as
there
is...
just
as
entertainment
enjoys
first
amendment
protection
as
expression.
and
in
the
case
at
bar,
at
least
the
stated
purpose
of
the
ordinance
is
to
prohibit
young
people
from
congregating.
the
preamble
says
in
fact
that
congregation
of
youthful
patrons
creates
problems
of
policing
due
to
the
need
to
protect
the
patrons
from
the
influence
of
those
who
promote
gambling,
sales
of
narcotics,
and
other
unlawful
activities.
so
the
purpose
of
this,
although
as
justice
stevens
points
out
it's
directed
to
individual
games
as
well
as
places
where
there
are
more
than
one
game,
the
purpose,
the
stated
purpose,
is
to
prevent
congregating,
which
is
an
exercise
of
the
right
of
association.
the
method
chosen
is
to
prevent
them
from
playing
the
games
when
they
get
there.
so
it's
perhaps
an
ineffectual
method
of
preventing
them
congregating,
but
that
is
its
purpose.
i
should
also
like
to
say
in
the
few
minutes
left
available
that
constitutional
guarantees
apply
to
minors
as
well
as
adults.
the
scope
of
the
particular
right
may
be
reduced
in
the
case
of
a
minor
by
one
or
more
of
the
factors
identified
by
justice
powell
in
bellotti
ii.
these
factors
are
taken
into
account
in
defining
the
state
interest
to
justify
the
regulation
limiting
a
fundamental
right.
but
nevertheless,
even
though
minors
are
involved,
the
fundamental
right
should
enjoy
the
strict
scrutiny...
the
protection
of
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
having
in
mind
that
the
state
may
have
a
stronger
interest
or
a
different
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
children
than
adults.
but
nevertheless,
the
strict
scrutiny
test
should
apply
and
the
restriction
should
bear
some...
should
serve
some
substantial
purpose
in
regulating
the
evil
to
which
it's
directed,
and
it
should
be
reasonably
limited...
the
means
should
be
limited
to
that
which
is
necessary
to
protect
the
interest.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
state's
compelling
interest
in
requiring
children
to
attend
school
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
truancy
law
and
prohibiting
children
from
congregating
elsewhere
during
school
hours.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
their
congregating
is
not
a
fundamental
right.
it
just
means
that
that
fundamental
right
has
to
be
balanced
against
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state,
and
in
that
instance
i
believe
the
state...
the
compelling
interest
prevails.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
if
the
court
agrees
that
the
games
involve
expression
and
a
fundamental
right,
then
there
is,
in
addition
to
the
fundamental
right
analysis,
strict
scrutiny
analysis
that
i
have
already
stated,
a
similar
analysis
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
think
i
shall
leave
to
my
brief
the
vagueness
issue.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
no,
your
honor.
we've
argued
that
it
is
not
moot.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
well,
we
say
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
recurrence,
and
we
argue
that
there
is
some
indication
of
that
from
the
fact
that
the
city
has
never
seen
fit
to
tell
any
court
that
it
repealed
the
old
ordinance
and
replaced
it
with
another
one.
and
the
city
says
it
would
like
to
go
back
to
it.
now,
that's
the--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--that's
it...
no,
not...
i'm
sorry.
the
tests
are,
under
the
los
angeles
county
case,
whether
there
is
any
reasonable
expectation
of
recurrence
of
the
violation
or
whether
events
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation
have
completely
eradicated
the
effects
of
the
violation.
that's
the
test
of
mootness.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
we
argue
that
you
should
not,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
explained
in
the
very
last
section
of
our
brief.
that
would
be
the
more
usual
disposition.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
if
you
thought
it
was
moot,
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that
would
be
correct,
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
would
stand.
the
alternative--
mr.
philip
w.
tone
--that
would
be...
they
would
be
free
to
reinstate
the
ordinance
all
over
again.
and
they
apparently
would
like
to
do
that.
so
i
think
there
is
good
reason
to
treat
this
as
the
exceptional
case
in
which
determination
of
mootness
should
not
result
in
the
vacating
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
think
the
question
of
whether...
the
question
of
whether
this
court
decides
the
case
is
a
case
or
controversy
question.
the
question
of
whether
this
court
leaves
standing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not,
in
our
submission.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
you
could
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
the
issue
is
moot,
your
honor.
we're
speaking
now
of
the
vagueness
issue.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
that's...
there's
nothing
for
it
to
operate
on,
but
the
ordinance
was
in
existence.
and
at
least
there
is
a
determination
that
that
ordinance,
which
has
now
been
replaced,
was
void
for
vagueness.
so
at
least
the
city
can't
re-enact
that
ordinance.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i
think
it
is
prudential,
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
tone
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
w.
tone
the
first
option
would
take
care
of
all
of
the
problems
except
for
the
vagueness
issue.
the
first
option
takes
care
of
the
age
restriction.
on
the
vagueness
issue,
i
would
submit
that
the
court,
if
it
determines
that
the
case
is
moot
since
the
ordinance
is
no
longer
in
existence,
then
simply
has
to
decide
whether
to
vacate
the
judgment
or
simply
dismiss
the
appeal.
we
argue
in
our
brief...
and
i
do
not,
of
course,
have
time
to
argue
it
here...
that
the
judgment
is
not
moot
because
it
meets
the
tests
of
the
los
angeles
county
case.
