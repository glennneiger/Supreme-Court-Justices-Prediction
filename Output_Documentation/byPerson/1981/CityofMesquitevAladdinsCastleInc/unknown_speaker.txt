unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
associate
together
to
fix
prices,
i
suppose
that's
freedom
of
association.
unknown
speaker
mr.
archer,
is
it
the
city's
position
that
playing
these
games
is
per
se
harmful
to
children?
unknown
speaker
is
the
age
matter
still
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
paramount
question?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you:
didn't
the...
wasn't
the
ordinance
declared
unconstitutional
on
both
state
and
federal
grounds?
unknown
speaker
on
the
age,
on
the
age,
on
the
age
part.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
claim
was
being
made
in
this
case
by
your
colleague
that
we
can't
reach
the
age
issue
because
it
was
declared
unconstitutional
under
the
state
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
that?
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
what
if
they
are?
but
nevertheless
the
court...
it
was
nevertheless
held
that
the
state
constitution
invalidated
this
position.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
an
independent
ground?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
state
court...
would
you
say
the
state
courts
have
a
rule
that
they
will
always
interpret
their
constitutional
provisions
identically
with
the
federal?
is
there
such
a
rule?
unknown
speaker
so
that
they're
just
forbidden
independently
to
construe
their
own
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
but
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
a
departure
from
the
regular
texas
rule
if
the
texas
court
said,
well,
i
know
the
federal
courts
are
holding...
would
permit
this
kind
of
an
ordinance,
but
we
just
construe
our
constitution
differently?
unknown
speaker
no.
well,
here
in
any
event
the
holding
that
both
the
federal
and
state
constitutions
were
violated
was
a
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
not
of
any
texas
court?
unknown
speaker
does
that
make
a
difference
on
whether
or
not
this
rests
on
an
adequate
state
ground?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
judgment
rests
on
the
holding
that
it
violates
the
state
constitution,
what's
the
case
doing
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
if
indeed
you
had
a
state,
texas
state
court
determination
of
a
state
constitutional
question
solely
based
on
the
state
constitutional
question,
that
that
would
raise
a
federal
question
because
the
state
constitutional
provision
was
the
same
as
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
a
federal
court?
would
an
action
lie
under
any
of
the
jurisdictional
provisions
were
a
federal
court
to
invalidate
an
ordinance
such
as
this
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
constitution
of
a
state?
unknown
speaker
was
this
case
a
diversity
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
ordinance
i
gather
does
make
the
distinction,
doesn't
it,
between
this
kind
of
entertainment
center
and
other
centers
where
teenagers
gather?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
ordinance
does
make
a
distinction,
though,
doesn't
it,
between
teenagers
who
play
these
games
and
teenagers
who
are
present
in
the
same
establishment?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
interest,
then,
that
the
city
is
trying
to
achieve
with
the
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
it's
to
prevent
the
children
from
spending
their
money?
unknown
speaker
but
the
ordinance
doesn't
prevent
them
from
going
to
the
centers,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
archer,
i
want
to
be
sure
about
a
statement
i
thought
you
made.
you
take
the
position
this
ordinance
is
not
directed
at
aladdin's?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
really
directed
at
alladdin's,
period?
unknown
speaker
i'm
speaking
of
1353,
enacted
just
two
days
after
a
significant
event.
unknown
speaker
then
you
can't
justify
that
on
the
fact
that
you
don't
want
the
children
to
go
to
these
places
where
there
are
drug
transactions.
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is,
the
ordinance
applies
to
the
seven
eleven
stores,
the
hotel
lobby,
and
everyplace
there's
one
of
these?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wasn't
really
as
concerned
with
the
association
point
as
the
reason
for
the
ordinance.
the
reason
for
the
ordinance
has
to
be,
i
think,
limited
to
the
fact
that
you
don't
want
the
under
17-year-olds
to
spend
25
cents
without
the
consent
of
their
parents.
unknown
speaker
well,
over
and
over
again,
maybe
they'll
spend
25
cents.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
doesn't
that
rationale
apply
to
miniature
golf
courses
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
can
understand
that
if
you're
talking
about
an
amusement
center.
but
the
ordinance
isn't
limited
to
amusement
centers.
that's
why
i
made
the
analogy
to
the
miniature
golf
course.
it
seems
to
me
it's
amusement
machines,
wherever
located...
seven
eleven,
hotel
lobbies,
pizza
joint,
whatever
it
might
be.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
a
state
or
municipality
could
totally
outlaw
the
use
of
coin-operated
machines?
unknown
speaker
but
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
base
its
holding
of
unconstitutionality
on
the
grounds
that
you
had
exceeded
your
power
under
state
law,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose
over
a
period
of
time,
counsel,
the
police
reported
to
the
authorities,
to
the
council,
that
a
great
deal
of
drug
traffic
was
taking
place
in
three
city
parks,
and
there
were
only
three
city
parks
in
the
city.
could
the
council
pass
an
ordinance
saying
that
17-year-olds
could
not
be
in
the
city
parks?
unknown
speaker
has
that
provision
been
stricken
from
the
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
moot?
what
controversy
is
there
now
about
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
an
advisory
opinion
from
us
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
ordinance
just
doesn't
exist
in
the
form
that
it
was
when
this
case
began.
unknown
speaker
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
its
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
still
appealing.
you're
the
one
who
brought
this
case
up,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
court
of
appeals
to
here.
unknown
speaker
but
meanwhile
you
amended
your
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
certainly
you
didn't
have
to
amend
the
ordinance.
you
could
simply
comply
with
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
and
seek
certiorari
and
get
a
judgment
from
this
court
seeking
to
overturn
the
fifth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
if
you
thought
you
had
to
obey
the
order,
you
didn't
need
to
repeal
the
ordinance
to
do
it.
you
could
just
not
have
enforced
this,
that
particular
criminal
elements
provision.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
dispute
about
that,
mr.
archer,
from
the
other
side,
your
present
analysis?
it
is
directed
to
the
chief
of
police?
unknown
speaker
do
you...
well,
i
can
ask
the
other
side.
where
is
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
appellee?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
tone,
suppose
that
the
only
claim
that
you
had
made
or
that
your
client
had
made
in
the
federal
district
court
was
under
the
laws
of
texas.
now,
certainly
in
a
diversity
suit
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
reviewed
it.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
we
could
review
it
here.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
it's
an
improper
appeal?
unknown
speaker
so
the
adequate
state
ground
argument
is
a
jurisdictional
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
we
surely
have
jurisdiction
in
a
diversity
case
to
pass
on
state
law
questions.
we
hardly
ever
do.
i
don't
know
since
i've
been
here
where
we
ever--
unknown
speaker
--why
is
that?
in
a
diversity
case
the
court
of
appeals
has
stricken
down
a
state
law.
unknown
speaker
now,
why
isn't
that
a
proper
appeal
here?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
if
we
dismissed
the
appeal
and
granted
cert?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
want
it
both
ways,
though?
you
don't
want
us
to
consider
that,
to
be
able
to
reach
the
state
ground
here,
but
you
want
to
use
the
state
ground
to
say
we
shouldn't
reach
anything.
unknown
speaker
to
avoid
reaching
any
ground,
to
say
that
we
haven't
any
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
then
have
we
not,
on
granting
certiorari,
on
treating
it
as
a
cert,
denied
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
supported
by
an
adequate
state
grounds?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
cox
broadcasting
has
changed
that
analysis
at
all?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
proper
disposition
is
if
we
agree
with...
if
we
happen
to
agree
with
you?
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
then,
treating
it
as
a
cert,
to
deny
cert
and
dismiss
it?
unknown
speaker
dismiss
it
as
improvidently
granted?
unknown
speaker
or
just
deny
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tone,
that
means
that
we
just
have
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
cert
and
decide
and
review
the
question
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
and
you
urge
in
this
case
what?
deny
it,
just
deny
cert?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
disagree
and
grant
it,
then
we
go
on
and
review
the
state
law
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
also,
could
we
not
if
we
took
it
as
a
cert...
i
understand
you're
arguing
we
must
dismiss
the
appeal.
but
if
we
took
it
as
a
cert,
could
we
not
do
what
we
did
in
the
ohio-zacchini
case
and
say,
well,
the
state
and
federal
law
is
parallel
and
we
will
decide
the
federal
question
and
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
state
law
question
in
the
light
of
what
we
say
about
the
federal
law?
we'd
have
power
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tone,
is
there
some
evidence...
in
the
zacchini
case,
the
evidence
was,
or
there
was
indication,
that
the
state
courts
felt
compelled
by
the
federal
rules.
but
here
is
there
any
evidence
that
texas
feels
bound
to
follow
the
federal
constitution
in
applying
its
own?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
so.
unknown
speaker
as
independent.
unknown
speaker
and
incidentally,
to
follow
my
brother
stevens'
suggestion,
it's
only
to
get
them
to
do
over
again
what
they've
already
done.
unknown
speaker
they've
already
said
what
the
state
law
is.
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
they'd
change
their
minds
because
we
decided
the
federal
question
one
way
or
another.
unknown
speaker
if
they're
wrong
about
the
federal
law
and
if
they
think
the
state
and
federal
rules
are
the
same,
as
your
opponent
argues...
now
maybe
he's
wrong...
then
if
we
corrected
their
analysis
of
federal
law,
conceivably
they
could
say,
well,
that
means
that
the
state
law
result
will
be
different.
unknown
speaker
this
is
all
hypothetical.
but
it's
at
least
conceivable.
unknown
speaker
or
different.
really,
all
they
do
is
have
a
phrase
in
there
saying
it
violates
both
provisions.
unknown
speaker
that
you
urged
below.
unknown
speaker
that
you
did
urge
and
they
didn't
pass
upon.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tone,
you
say
if
we
were
to
take
the
case.
probable
jurisdiction
here
was
noted
in
may.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
take
it
as
a
cert.--
unknown
speaker
--you
would
be
quite
content,
i
take
it,
if
we
held
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
appeal,
but
treated
as
cert
we
would
deny
it?
i
want
to
be
sure.
unknown
speaker
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
one
point,
you're
also
arguing
that
unless
we
treat
it
as
a
cert
and
if
we
just
act
on
a
noting
of
probable
jurisdiction
under
1254(2),
you
would
agree
then
we
don't
have
the
power
to
listen
to
any
state
law
argument?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
mr
tone,
do
you
question
that
a
state
could
totally
outlaw
pinball
machines
which
require
insertion
of
coins
to
operate?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tone,
who
is
the
author,
the
mechanic?
unknown
speaker
who
is
the
author?
unknown
speaker
the
mechanic?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
mechanic.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
this
factory
also
puts
out
adding
machines.
would
they
also
be
protected?
unknown
speaker
but
say
it
is
the
author...
they
had
the
same
author.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
the
same
author.
i'm
just
worried
about
your
word
"author".
unknown
speaker
but
so
is
the
adding
machine.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure.
i
just
raise
the
question.
unknown
speaker
likely
a
patent,
would
it
not
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
tone,
supposing
that
in
the
electrical
antitrust
cases,
certainly
the
person
who
thought
up
the
phase
of
the
moon
element
of
that
and
the
complicated
parts
of
it
in
the
early
60's
was
putting
in
a
good
deal
of
intellectual
input
and
confiding
it
to
a
number
of
other
people
who
were
in
the
same
position
he
was.
were
their
activities
protected
against
the
sherman
act?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
red
lion
case,
where
certainly
people
are
communicating,
but
a
government
agency
is
telling
them
that
they
have
to
present
the
other
side
too?
unknown
speaker
that's
because
they're
using
the
public
highway,
is
it
not?
isn't
that
the
rationale
of
the
red
lion
and
related
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
other
place,
any
place
in
the
city
that
people
under
17
can
be
entertained?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
reasonable
time
and
place
restrictions
are
available,
are
legal,
or
not
necessarily
invalid,
anyway?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
place
limitation?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
half
a
mile
prohibiting
games,
a
half
a
mile
from
a
school,
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
or
prohibiting
17-year-olds
to
go
in
and
play
these
machines
in
a
bar,
a
barroom?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
place.
it
would
also
survive
first
amendment
analysis.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
rule
applies,
that
every
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
has
to
satisfy
that
test?
unknown
speaker
can
one
gamble
on
these
games?
unknown
speaker
you
could
bet
on
the
outcome?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
a
chug-a-lug
contest.
could
a
state
or
a
city
forbid
that?
unknown
speaker
a
chug-a-lug
contest,
who
could
chug-a-lug
the
most
glasses
of
beer.
unknown
speaker
there
may
be
some
17-year-olds
who
would
disagree
with
you.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
tone,
these
games
are
very
lucrative.
unknown
speaker
lucrative.
unknown
speaker
even
at
25
cents
a
shot.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
more
than
twice
as
much
money
is
spent
on
these
in
this
country
today
than
on
motion
pictures?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
powerful
speech.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say...
in
seriousness,
who
is
doing
the
speaking
there,
the
player
or
the
originator?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
colloquy,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
little
one
at
home?
same
kind
of
machines
you
have
at
home
now.
unknown
speaker
and
much
more
expensive.
unknown
speaker
these
machines
are
several
thousand.
unknown
speaker
how
about
truancy
laws,
mr.
tone,
where
a
group
of
youths
say,
we
want
to
congregate
at
this
particular
pool
hall
during
school
hours
rather
than
go
to
school?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
you
something
about
that.
if
you
think
the
issue
is
moot,
which
i
take
it
you
do...
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
other
instances
where,
in
a
situation
like
that,
we've
recognized
this
exception
to
the
mootness
doctrine,
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review;
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
suppose
that,
however,
we
disagree
with
you
and
say
that
it's
moot.
shouldn't
we
then
to
that
extent
vacate
the
opinions
below
and
dismiss
the
case
to
that
extent?
unknown
speaker
if
we
thought
it
was
moot.
unknown
speaker
but
unless
we
do
that,
if
i
understand
it,
the
city
is
now
disabled
from
re-enacting
the
ordinance
it
wants
to
enact,
by
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
unknown
speaker
if
we
vacate
everything,
presumably
they'll
just
reinstate
it.
unknown
speaker
it
really
isn't...
it's
a
jurisdictional
question.
it's
a
case
or
controversy
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
there's
no
longer
a...
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
isn't
final.
we
have
to
do
something.
we've
noted
probable
jurisdiction,
so
we
have
to
do
something
with
the
case.
that
judgment
isn't
final,
and
it's
moot.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
nothing
then
to...
there's
nothing
then
for
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
to
operate
on.
the
issue
it
decided
is
gone.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
think
that
our
practice
of
vacating
moot
judgments
in
moot
cases
is
just
prudential?
unknown
speaker
would
your
first
option
take
care
of
all
these
problems?
unknown
speaker
your
first
option
that
you
argued
today.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
archer?
you
have
a
few
minutes.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
under
your
view
if
this
problem
of
state-federal
law
had
been
threshed
out
more
fully
in
the
court
of
appeals
during
argument,
which...
should
it
have
based
the
decision
on
state
law
or
federal
law,
if
it
had
to
choose
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
no,
if
they
have
to
choose.
they
decide
they
ought
to
take
one.
is
there
a
doctrine
they
should
take
the
state
law
ground
in
order
to
avoid
the
unnecessary
decision
of
a
federal
constitution
question?
unknown
speaker
they
really
just
cited
federal
cases
except
for
one
state
case
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues.
