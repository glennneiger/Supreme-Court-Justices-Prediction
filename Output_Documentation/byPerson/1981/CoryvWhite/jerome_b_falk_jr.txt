mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
though
we
were
here
before
in
california
versus
texas,
the
issues
of
jurisdiction
now
presented
by
this
petition
were
not
addressed
in
any
of
the
brief
of
the
parties,
or
with
the
exception
of
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
in
the
concurring
opinion.
indeed,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
in
the
days
following
the
decision
in
california
versus
texas,
many
of
us,
myself
included,
thought
that
the
concurring
opinions
had
pointed
the
way
to
a
workable
and
fair
procedure
for
the
resolution
of
the
domicile
dispute
concerning
the
domicile
of
howard
hughes.
however,
in
the
months
that
followed,
numerous
procedural
and
jurisdictional
problems
not
ventillated
in
california
versus
texas
became
apparent.
i
intend
to
discuss
three
grounds
which
preclude,
in
our
view,
preclude
the
district
court
from
exercising
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
a
central
theme
of
those
issues
is
that
congress
has
simply
never
undertaken
to
fashion
a
statutory
process
for
the
resolution
of
interstate
death
tax
controversies
of
this
kind.
the
court
of
appeals
sought
to
bend
the
federal
interpleader
act
to
that
task,
but
for
the
three
reasons
i
will
discuss,
the
act
simply
will
not
serve.
moreover,
though
i
will
not
separately
discuss
the
issue
today
of
changing
venue,
the
court
of
appeals
use
and
understanding
of
the
interpleader
act
would
produce
what
we
believe
is
the
absurd
and
unfair
result
of
requiring
a
state,
california
in
this
instance,
to
litigate
its
death
tax
claim
for
what
is
an
enormous
sum
of
money
before
a
jury
of
texas
citizens
when
the
issue
involves
the
rival
claim
of
the
state
of
texas.
we
submit
that
this
is,
if
nothing
else,
further
evidence
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
the
interpleader
act
to
be
used
in
this
fashion.
the
first
ground
of
objecting
to
jurisdiction
is,
of
course,
28
u.s.c.
1251
(a).
although
congress
has
in
recent
years
allowed
concurrent
lower
court
jurisdiction
for
most
categories
of
controversies
which
are
within
the
court's
original
jurisdiction,
one
category
has
remained
outside
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
mode,
and
has
always
been
within
the
court's
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction,
namely,
controversy
among
different
states.
there
is
no
way
to
square
the
maintenance
of
this
action
in
a
district
court
with
the
clear
command
of
congress
in
section
1251(a)
that
only
this
court
can
hear
such
controversies.
now,
in
making
that
statement
i
am,
of
course,
mindful
that
in
california
versus
texas,
the
court
declined
to
permit
us
to
exercise
or
to
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction,
and
i
am
also
aware
that
three
justices
wrote
then
that
there
was
not
then
a
justiciable
controversy
between
california
and
texas.
as
the
court
knows,
we
have
now
filed
a
new
motion
for
leave
to
file
an
original
complaint,
and
at
pages
28
to
39
of
that
motion,
we
endeavor
to
show
that
there
is
indeed
a
present
case
or
controversy
between
california
and
texas,
but
that
question
isn't
presented
here,
and
need
not
be
addressed
today.
i
say
that
because
this
case
is
different
from
what
was
before
the
court
in
1978.
then
justice
stewart
was
able
to
write
that
each
state
was
free
to
proceed
in
its
own
courts,
and
each
state
could
obtain,
in
theory,
in
its
own
courts
a
favorable
judgment,
without
regard
to
the
acts
of
the
other
or
the
proceedings
in
the
courts
of
the
other
state.
that
is
no
longer
true.
now
that
there
has
been
filed
an
interpleader
action,
california
and
texas
must
square
off
as
adversaries
in
a
federal
district
court.
each
must
file
pleadings
answering
the
claim
of
the
other,
and
responding
to
the
position
of
the
other,
for
that
is
standard
interpleader
practice,
and
because
the
claims
are
mutually
inconsistent,
it
california
wins,
texas
must
lose,
and
if
texas
wins,
california
must
lose.
each
is
enjoined
by
the
district
court
from
proceeding
in
their
respective
state
courts.
the
states
are,
in
short,
litigation
adversaries
in
a
single
lawsuit,
and
this
is
therefore
now
a
controversy
between
states
within
the
meaning
of
section
1251,
even
if
one
agrees
with
what
was
said
in
the
concurring
opinions
in
california
versus
texas.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
impossible
under
our
law
and
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
texas,
and
i
believe
under
the
law
of
every
state
in
the
united
states,
but
certainly
under
the
laws
of
the
two
states.
an
individual
may
have
but
one
domicile.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
brennan.
i
think
the
courts'
decisions
make
clear
that
states
can
have
other
bases
for
taxation,
but
in
the
cases
of
california
and
texas,
they
do
not.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
i
meant
to
say
that
i
do
not
believe
it
is
constitutional
principle.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it
is
simply
the
law
of
california
and
the
law
of
texas.
i
make
the
statement,
then,
that
we
are...
that
this
is
a
controversy
between
states
without
regard
to
what
the
court
may
ultimately
say
about
our
pending
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
new
original
complaint.
naturally,
we
hope,
for
the
reasons
stated
there,
that
the
court
will
permit
it
to
be
filed.
but
we
also
recognize
that
there
are
prudential
or
may
be
prudential
limitations
on
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
in
this
situation,
some
of
which
were
discussed
by
justice
stewart
in
his
concurring
opinion.
if
the
court
declines
on
any
of
those
grounds
to
permit
california
to
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction,
the
fact
remains
that
congress
has
not
created
an
alternative
form
in
a
district
court
for
the
litigation
of
controversies
between
states
which
this
court
declines
to
adjudicate.
this
court
has
turned
down
over
the
years
many
suits
brought
by
one
state
against
the
other.
not
too
many
days
ago
it
declined
to
hear
a
controversy
between
california
and
the
state
of
west
virginia
over
an
unplayed
football
game.
the
decision
by
the
court
not
to
permit
jurisdiction
to
be
invoked
in
that
case
did
not
automatically
create
jurisdiction
in
some
other
court
for
the
resolution
of
that
controversy.
so,
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
section
1251(a)
bars
this
action.
the
second
ground
for
objection
to
jurisdiction,
which
of
course
the
court
does
not
need
to
reach
if
it
agrees
with
the
first,
is
a
constitutional
one,
founded
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
court's
cases
have
traditionally
identified
two
distinct
requirements
which
must
be
satisfied
for
suit
to
be
brought
against
a
state
officer
in
a
federal
court.
first,
there
must
be
a
colorable
allegation
that
the
defendant
has
acted
unconstitutionally
or
in
violation
of
his
statutory
authority
or
her
statutory
authority.
second,
only
prospective
injunctive
relief
is
being
sought,
or
at
least
that
there
be
sought
prospective
injunctive
relief.
in
this
case,
the
second
requirement
is
satisfied,
but
the
first
is
not.
here
the
texas
and
california
taxing
officials
who
are
defendants
are
plainly
acting
within
their
statutory
authority,
and
they
are
not
violating
the
constitution.
obviously,
the
domicile
claim
advanced
by
one
or
the
other
or
conceivably
by
both
of
the
state
taxing
officials
is
wrong
on
the
facts,
but
that
does
not
make
the
assertion
of
the
claim
unconstitutional.
all
each
of
these
officials
seek
to
do
is
to
submit
their
relevant
evidence
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
obtain
a
judicial
determination
in
that
court.
worcester
county
trust
company
versus
riley
holds
that
this
does
not
violate
the
constitution,
and
that
portion
of
the
opinion
in
that
case
has
never
been
questioned
and
was
not
questioned
in
the
concurring
opinions
in
california
versus
texas,
and
is
supported
by
many
decisions
of
the
court.
thus,
one
is
brought
to
the
state's
principal
argument,
that
edelman
versus
jordan
somehow
dispensed
with
the
requirement
that
illegality
be
shown,
and
left
only
the
requirement
that
prospective
relief
be
sought.
i
recognize
that
three
justices
implied
in
california
versus
texas
that
this
was
so.
with
all
respect,
i
think
edelman
does
not
stand
for
that
proposition,
and
that
indeed
there
is
no
warrant
for
what
would
be
a
genuinely
radical
change
in
our
eleventh
amendment
law.
edelman
focused
on
and
clarified
the
line
between
prospective
relief,
which
is
allowed,
and
retrospective
relief,
which
is
not.
but
it
could
not
have
held
that
the
first
requirement,
a
showing
of
unconstitutional
conduct
or
violation
of
statute,
need
not
be
required.
it
could
not
have
held
that,
because
in
edelman
the
defendants
were
found
to
have
violated
a
controlling
federal
statute.
now,
the
element
of
illegality
is
an
integral
part
of
the
eleventh
amendment
law.
it
follows
from
ex
parte
young,
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
did
not
bar
a
suit
against
state
officers
if
the
officer
was
acting
unconstitutionally,
on
the
ground,
admittedly
somewhat
ficticious,
but
an
important
fiction,
on
the
ground
that
the
illegality
of
the
conduct
severed
the
officer's
nexus
to
the
state,
and
thus
the
suit
could
be
maintained.
for
that
reason,
the
element
of
illegality
in
an
eleventh
amendment
case
is
crucial.
without
it,
the
suit
against
a
state
officer
in
his
official
capacity
remains
a
suit
against
the
state,
and
thus
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
regardless
of
whether
the
relief
is
retrospective
or
prospective.
no
decision
of
this
court
has
ever
suggested
that
the
requirement
of
unconstitutional
or
illegal
conduct
could
be
dispensed
with.
indeed,
the
court
reaffirmed
the
requirement
of
illegal
conduct,
of
unconstitutional
conduct
or
a
violation
of
the
statute,
in
larson
versus
domestic
and
foreign
commerce
corporation.
that
is
not
a
case
cited
in
the
briefs,
i
regret
to
say.
it
is
found
at
337
u.s.
682.
that
is
a
case
involving
the
parallel
rule
of
sovereign
immunity
for
federal
officials,
and
has
been
cited
by
the
court
as
reflecting
of
good
eleventh
amendment
law
as
well.
in
larson,
the
defendant's
conduct
was
assertedly
tortious,
and
also
in
violation
of
contract.
prospective
relief
was
sought.
the
court
nonetheless
held
that
sovereign
immunity
barred
the
suit
against
the
federal
officer
because
his
conduct
was
neither
unconstitutional
or
in
violation
of
his
statutory
power,
against
a
claim
that
it
was
illegal
and
thus
also
permissible
as
a
suit,
because
it
was
tortious.
therefore,
acceptance
of
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
theory--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no.
the
authority...
they
have
authority
to
make
the
claim.
the
court
will
not
award--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--no,
their
authority...
the
only
authority
they
have
exercised
so
far
is
to
propose
to
file
a
claim.
they
do
not...
and
they
will
collect
the
tax
only
if
the
court
orders
or
finds
that
there
had
been
domiciliary.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
surely
they
have
authority
to
file
a
claim,
in
the
same
way,
justice
stevens,
that
a
district
attorney
has
authority
to
file
a
criminal
indictment
or
a
criminal
complaint,
even
if
the
defendant
is
in
the
objective
sense
of
the
word
innocent.
i
mean,
every
government
lawyer,
be
it
civil
or
criminal,
files
claims
in
court
that
ultimately
a
court
rejects.
they
are
certainly
not
acting
in
an
ultra
vires
way
when
they
do
that,
and
that
is
the
position
of
the
controller
of
california.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
in
edelman
versus
jordan,
there
was
conduct
engaged
in
that
was
in
direct
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
that
is
the
difference
between
this--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--i
think
i
am
repeating
myself,
but
we
are
not...
the
controller
of
california
and
the
controller
of
texas
are
not
proposing
to
collect
a
tax
without
juridical
process.
that
is
the
difference.
all
that
they
are
doing
is
filing
claims
which
a
court
will
decide.
it
cannot
be
said
that
a
state
officer
or
state
attorney
violates
the
law
by
going
to
court
and
presenting
a
claim.
that
is
what
worcester
county
dealt
with,
and
held
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
that
that
is
not
unconstitutional
conduct,
or
illegal
conduct.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
that's
true.
i
want
to
just
make
this
observation,
that
acceptance
of
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
theory
would
have
serious
consequences
beyond
the
four
corners
of
this
case.
because
the
law
of
sovereign
immunity
for
federal
officers
and
the
law
of
the
eleventh
amendment
for
state
officers
has
been
linked
over
the
years
and
somewhat
homogenized,
a
decision
in
this
case
dispensing
with
the
requirement
of
illegality
would
effectively
overrule
the
larson
case
and
destroy
a
workable
line
of
demarcation
which
has
existed
at
least
since
ex
parte
young,
and
i
think
it
would
also
open
the
doors
to
federal
courts
to
suits
against
state
and
federal
officers
for
injunctive
relief
in
a
wide
variety
of
cases
theretofore
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
and
the
eleventh
amendment,
such
as
suits
to
enjoin
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
difference
in
principle
between
interpleader
and
other
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
a
sense,
interpleader
is
an
even
easier
case
than
larson.
in
larson,
there
was
illegal
conduct
in
the
sense
of
tortious
conduct,
and
yet
the
court
said
tortious
conduct
is
still
within
the
officer's
authority
and
is
not...
and
suit
may
not
be
maintained
against
him.
so,
i
think,
in
a
sense
this
is
a
less
close
case
than
a
tort
case
would
be,
as
you
had
in
larson.
the
third
ground
of
objection
i
will
speak
to
very
briefly,
and
that
has
to
do
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
interpleader
act.
when
one
looks
at
the
interpleader
act,
and
tries
to
fit
it
to
suits
of
this
kind,
the
fit
is
very
poor.
section
1335
requires
at
least
two
claimants
of
citizenship
of
diverse
states,
and
refers
to
the
general
definition
of
diverse
citizenship
in
the
diversity
statute.
this
requirement
has
been
referred
to
as
minimal
diversity.
but
neither
the
united
states
nor
taxing
officials
of...
or
any
officials
of
states
or
states
themselves
are
citizens
of
states,
so
the
act
doesn't
apply
to
them.
and
thus
the
court
of
appeals
found
minimal
diversity
here
only
as
to
two
parties,
neither
of
whom
were
the
state
taxing
officials.
the
first
was
mr.
lummis,
who
is
the
administrator
of
the
hughes
estate,
and
the
stakeholder
who
filed
the
lawsuit.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
his
citizenship
could
be
considered
because
he
was
an
interested
stakeholder
in
the
sense
that
he
also
has
a
claim,
was
therefore
a
claimant,
and
his
citizenship
of
nevada
could
be
considered
as
one
of
the
two
claimants
for
minimal
diversity.
we
think
that
was
error
for
reasons
discussed
in
the
brief,
and
which
i
will
not
repeat
here.
but
even
if
mr.
lummis
qualifies
as
one
of
the
two
necessary
claimants,
there
is
a
serious
problem
with
the
necessary
second
one.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
second
claimant
in
mr.
alvord,
the
los
angeles
county
treasurer,
who
it
found
was
a
claimant
because
under
the
then
existing
law
the
county
of
los
angeles
was
to
receive
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
state
inheritance
tax.
however,
effective
january
1,
1981,
california
law
was
changed
as
part
of
an
overall
revision
of
the
inheritance
and
gift
tax
law,
and
the
entire
tax
is
now
paid
to
the
state.
mr.
alvord
will
get
nothing.
the
county
of
los
angeles
will
get
nothing.
he
has
therefore--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--absolutely
not.
it
had
been
a
state
bar
proposal.
it
had
been
pending
for
years,
and
we
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
as
a
result
of
the
legislation,
however,
mr.
alvord
has
abandoned
any
claim
to
the
fund,
and
must
be
dismissed
as
a
party.
thus,
if
jurisdiction
is
determined
as
of
this
moment,
or
at
least
as
of
january
1,
1981,
we
have
only
one
claimant
and
minimal
diversity
has
not
been
satisfied,
and
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
the
estate
argues,
however,
that
jurisdiction
must
be
determined
as
of
the
date
the
complaint
was
filed,
when
alvord
did
have
a
claim,
and
that
subsequent
events
do
not
affect
it.
that
is,
to
be
sure,
consistent
with
a
general
rule
that
jurisdiction
be
measured
at
the
time
a
complaint
is
filed,
but
we
say
that
this
case
falls
within
a
second...
within
a
clearly
marked
exception
to
that
general
rule,
and
that
is
that
where
a
party
is
added
or
deleted
after
a
complaint
is
filed,
then
the
courts
re-examine
jurisdiction
in
light
of
the
new
lineup
of
parties,
and
we
cite
at
pages
33
and
34
of
our
brief
six
different
categories
of
cases,
every
conceivable
permutation
in
which
this
rule
has
been
applied
by
the
courts.
and
therefore,
because
mr.
alvord
is
not
a
claimant
today,
and
must
be
dismissed
as
a
party,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
section
1335
is
absent.
now,
many
states,
including
california,
have
voluntarily
agreed
by
statute
to
submit
to
binding
arbitration
as
a
means
of
resolving
controversies
of
this
kind.
unfortunately,
some
other
states,
including
texas,
have
not.
and
thus,
a
suitable
federal
process
for
the
resolution
of
domicile
disputes
would
be
desirable,
but
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
enact
that
legislation,
despite
decades
of
judicial
and--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
justice
brennan,
that
it
would
be
likely
to
be
a
district
court
proceeding,
as
an
express,
explicit
exception
to
section
1251(a)'s
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
i
am
absolutely
confident
that
congress
would
take
into
account
the
problem
of
venue,
and
provide
for
venue
in
a
state
whose
citizens
are
not
interested
in
the
outcome.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
and
that
surprises
me
in
light
of
extensive
literature
on
this
problem
before
and
after
texas
versus
florida.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
although
it
is
the
last
one,
i
think,
that
will
involve
claims
exceeding
100
percent,
because
as
a
result
of
the
changes
in
the
federal
tax
rates,
i
think
you
will
never
see
another
case
in
which
the
claims
exceed
100
percent.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
is
right,
justice
white,
and
conceivably
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well.
we
make
that
suggestion
in
our
footnote
in
our
reply
brief.
but
because
it
has--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--implementing...
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes.
the
estate
asks
the
court
to
create
the
remedy
that
congress
has
yet
to
address,
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
high
price
to
be
paid
for
that
course.
first,
it
would
require
the
court
to
disregard
what
i
think
is
fairly
said
to
be
the
plain
meaning
of
section
1251(a).
second,
without
any
explicit
legislative
intent
to
overcome
the
immunity
afforded
states
and
state
officers
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
as
was
found
present
in
fitzpatrick
versus
bitzer
and
huto
versus
finney,
the
estate
would
open
the
door
to
state
officers
without
any
showing
of
illegal
or
unconstitutional
conduct.
third,
it
would
result
in
an
interpleader
remedy
with
a
venue
provision
that
for
this
purpose
is
just
awful,
resulting
in
suit
being
heard
in
one
of
the
two
claimant
states
before
a
jury
of
interested
citizens.
for
those
reasons,
we
think
that
the
court
should
not
accept
the
invitation
of
the
estate
to
distort
the
interpleader
act
in
the
way
that
has
been
proposed,
and
to
leave
to
congress
the
task
of
fashioning
an
appropriate
remedy.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
discuss
for
a
moment
the
relationship
between
this
action
and
the
original
suit,
in
light
of
some
of
the
questions
which
were
asked
of
counsel.
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit,
it
will
then
have
a
choice
between
an
original...
allowing
an
original
suit
and
leaving
california
and
texas
to
their
own
state
court
proceedings
with
the
attendant
risk
of
inconsistent
verdicts
and
taxation
in
excess
of
100
percent
of
the
estate
assets.
texas
asks
you
to
allow
that
latter
course.
indeed,
it
views
even
a
district
court
interpleader
suit
as
a
lesser
intrusion
upon
state
sovereignty
than
an
original
action
here.
but
an
interpleader
suit
in
the
district
court
would
breach
a
180-year
tradition
mandated
by
statute
that
all
controversies
between
states
be
heard,
if
at
all,
in
this
court.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
i
will
answer
that,
justice
stevens.
there
are
several
changes,
although
i
certainly
must
say
that...
well,
let
me
respond
to
it
this
way.
first
of
all,
these
are
the
differences
between
what
existed
in
1978
and
what
exists
today.
first,
if
this
court
reverses
the
fifth
circuit,
then
you
will
know
and
we
will
know
that
there
is
no
alternative
remedy
other
than
a
suit
in
this
court.
justice
brennan
specifically
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
california
versus
texas
which
made
that
point.
secondly,
there
was
at
the
time
of
the
1978
case,
as
mr.
harrison
said,
the
provisional
settlement
between
california
and
texas
which
texas
asserted
here
was
collusive
and
made
a
number
of
points
about
it,
and
it
elicited
a
number
of
questions
from
the
court
which
at
least
clouded
the
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
a
present
controversy
between
california
and
texas.
that
settlement,
the
conditions
of
that
settlement
were
not
satisfied.
there
is
no
settlement
or
any
agreement
between
california
and--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--no,
there
is
not
a
determination.
you
have
an
allegation
which
is
entirely
plausible
based
on
the
face
of
the
tax
rates
that
it
is
over
100
percent,
and
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
allegation
is
untrue,
and
that
was
enough
in
texas
versus
florida.
i
don't
think
you
could
ever
have
more
until
it
is
too
late.
i
am
going
to
make
the
point
in
a
moment
that
if
you
wait,
it
will
be
too
late
because
the
horse
will
be
out
of
the
barn.
and
finally,
there
were
in
1978
a
number
of
ancillary
disputes
which
have
since
bean
resolved,
those
disputes
involving,
for
example,
the
so-called
mormon
will,
mr.
dumar's
famous
will,
the
questions
of
airship,
a
claim
by
hhmi,
the
howard
hughes
medical
institute,
that
there
was
a
will
which
had
become
lost,
all
of
which
affected
the
tax
position,
and
which
were
urged
by
texas
in
opposition
to
california
versus
texas
as
problems
affecting
ripeness.
those
problems
have
been
resolved
in
the
trial
courts,
and
in
many
instances
are
final.
so,
all
of
those
matters
have
been
resolved.
now,
turning
to
the
point
i
was
making--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--to
sustain
the
interpleader
so
as
to...
i
don't
follow
that,
justice
white,
because
if
we
do
sustain
the
district
court
interpleader,
there
is
the
alternative
remedy,
and
this
court
would
not
take
jurisdiction.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
a
dispute
between
two
states.
that,
of
course...
our
point
is
that
it
cannot
be
in
any
court
but
this,
because
it
is
a
dispute
between
two
states.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it
is
a
suit
between
two
states.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
was
here
as
the
moving
party
then.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
but
i
do
believe
that
there
were
grounds
for
denying
that
motion
which
are
no
longer
present.
that
is
the
burden--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--at
the
time.
in
other
words--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--yes,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
motion
for
leave
to
file.
there
is
an
intensely
practical
reason
why
there
is
a
controversy
between
states
and
will
be
even
without
the
interpleader
suit.
you
might
ask,
well,
what
is
the
harm
if
there
is
no
interpleader,
and
let
california
proceed,
and
let
texas
proceed,
and
one
can
see
what
happens.
the
problem
is
this.
almost
immediately
after
mr.
hughes
died,
texas
began
a
suit
which
ultimately
resulted
in
a
determination
of
a
texas
domicile
in
the
texas
state
courts.
california
was
required
by
its
own
law
to
wait
until
the
estate
filed
its
tax
return,
known
as
the
it
22.
that
was
not
done
for
a
year
and
a
half
roughly
after
mr.
hughes
died.
only
after
the
it
22
was
filed,
under
our
law,
does
the
administrative
process
begin
which
leads
to
the
judicial
process.
by
the
time
that
judicial
process
was
about
to
commence,
an
injunction
had
been
entered
by
the
district
court
which
continues
to
this
very
day.
but
by
then,
texas
had
its
judgment,
so
these
were
not
really
parallel
trains.
one
is
well
ahead
of
the
other.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
as
we
allege
in
paragraph
26
of
the
proposed
complaint,
which
is
attached
to
the
motion
for
leave
to
file,
if
the
fifth
circuit
decision
is
reversed,
and
the
stay
is
lifted,
the
texas
judgment
could
and
undoubtedly
would
become
final
rather
quickly,
and
texas
would
then
be
in
a
position
to
execute
that
judgment,
and
so
by
the
time
california
was
able
to
complete
its
administrative
and
judicial
process,
the
estate
could
and
undoubtedly
would
be
substantially
depleted,
and
california
might
find
very
little
left
when
it
comes
to
perfect
its
own
judgment.
so,
that
course,
from
california's
point
of
view,
simply
will
not
work,
and
there
is
thus
an
immediate
threat
to
california
posed
by
the
texas
judgment,
and
that
is
what
creates,
in
our
view,
the
case
or
controversy
proposed
by
our
motion
for
leave
to
file,
which
would
justify
allowing
an
original
suit
to
be
brought.
justice
o'connor
asked
what,
if
anything,
is
different
between
now
and
1978,
and
i
think
i
have
addressed
those
questions.
there
were
also
some
questions
about
choice
of
law,
and
i
think
a
brief
comment
would
be
in
order.
whether
the
controversy
is
resolved
here
or
in
a
district
court
action,
the
court
would
not
need
to
resolve
any
choice
of
law
problem
unless
there
is
a
conflict
of
laws
which
is
outcome
determinative.
there
is
no
such
conflict.
at
pages
17
to
18
of
our
brief,
in
footnote
22,
we
cite
the
relevant
texas
and
california
authorities,
and
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
the
law
of
california
and
texas
on
domicile
is--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--well,
you
wouldn't
have
to--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--i
think
you
don't
ever
have
to
face
the
question.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
court
in
several
cases
has
said
that
in
an
original
suit,
it
can
apply
state
law
when
the
two
states
have
the
same
law.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
you
borrow.
the
court
undoubtedly
has
the
power
to
fashion
its
own
law.
i
have
no
doubt
of
that.
but
if
you
don't
have
an
outcome
determinative
conflict,
the
problem
never
arises.
for
these
reasons,
we
urge
the
court
not
only
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit,
but
also
to
permit
the
original
suit
to
be
filed.
it
will
be
the
most
practical
and
efficient
means
of
resolving
this
controversy,
and
i
think
it
will
not
prove
burdensome.
it
would
be
fair
to
all
concerned,
and
although
this
may
be
the
last
such
case
ever
to
be
brought,
it
ought
to
be
resolved
properly.
thank
you.
