unknown
speaker
if
you
were
legitimately
before
the
district
court
in
an
interpleader
action,
is
it
impossible
that
that
court
could
conclude
that
under
the
law
of
california
as
well
as
under
the
law
of
texas,
that
mr.
hughes
was
a
domiciliary
of
both
states?
is
that
impossible?
unknown
speaker
is
that
constitutionally
requisite,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
is,
do
you
think
it
is
a
constitutional
principle
that
one
may
have
only
one
domicile?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk--
unknown
speaker
--do
the
california
taxing
officials
have
statutory
authority
to
collect
these
taxes
if
the
decedent
was
not
a
resident
of
california?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
their
authority
depend
on
whether
or
not
hughes
was
a
resident
of
california?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
was
not
a
resident
of
california,
do
they
even
have
authority
to
file
a
claim
to
tax
the
intangibles?
unknown
speaker
in
edelman
against
jordan,
did
you
know
that
the
defendant
there,
the
state
official
acted
improperly
until
you
addressed
the
merits?
didn't
he
have
the
authority
to
do
the
preliminary
things
that
were
challenged?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
is
the
conduct
any
different
than
collecting
a
tax
from
a
non-resident
decedent?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
in
all
the
cases
where
a
suit
against
a
state
officer
has
been
permitted,
that
they
were
different
in
this
respect?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
this
could
be
limited
to
the
interpleader
situation?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
change
was
not
the
result
of
the
pendency
of
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
what
form
do
you
think
that
should
take,
mr.
falk?
unknown
speaker
any
suggestion
yet
to
the
congress
to
do
something?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
the
hughes
case
is
not
the
only
one
likely
to
arise.
unknown
speaker
the
power
of
congress
to
do
it
would
be
because
the
judicial
power
extends
to
controversies
between
states?
unknown
speaker
under
section
5,
you
mean
implementing
section
1?
unknown
speaker
yes.
implementing
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
case
goes
forward
and
a
decision
is
had,
one
of
the
states
will
not
be
free
to
go
forward
in
its
own
state.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so,
but
only
one
state
is
going
to
ultimately
be
able
to
collect
the
taxes.
unknown
speaker
and
except
for
the
interpleader,
both
states
could
have
gone
forward
in
their
own
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
with...
i
thought
the
court
indicated
one
reason
for
denying
leave
to
file
in
the
case
before,
that
both
courts
could...
both
states
could
go
forward--
unknown
speaker
--and
determine
domicile,
and
collect
their
tax.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
diversity
in
your
interpleader
action?
unknown
speaker
would
you
spell
that
out
for
me?
unknown
speaker
on
that
thesis,
though,
this
makes
the
howard
hughes
situation
a
freak,
doesn't
it?
because
the
next
howard
hughes
that
will
come
along,
you
won't
have
that
county
treasurer
in
there.
unknown
speaker
why
wasn't
it
so
held
below?
unknown
speaker
because
the
state
taxing
official
was
thought
in
his
official
capacity
to
represent
the
state,
which
isn't
a
party.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
which
doesn't
qualify
for
diversity.
unknown
speaker
how
about
illegality?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
always
go
on
the
papers
for
jurisdiction.
sometimes
there
are
some
affidavits
or
some
hearing
or
even
evidence
is
taken.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
going
to
get
an
injunction
unless
you
claim
he
is
doing
something
wrong.
unknown
speaker
but
edelman
does
require
illegality,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
or
statutory
violation.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
comment
or
is
your
colleague
going
to
comment
on
the
new
motion
to
take
original
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
and
why
that
isn't
an
expeditious
and
relatively
simple
way
of
solving
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
one
of
the
states
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
collect
its
inheritance
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
i
am
just
wondering
how
realistic
it
is
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
controversy
between
two
states.
i
know
the
officials
are
there,
but
nevertheless
the
state
treasury
is
certainly
involved.
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
appeal
pending
in
your
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
that
appeal
was
pending,
isn't
that
a
negative
factor
in
original
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
be
a
reversal.
unknown
speaker
has
there
been
a
determination
yet
in
california
that
mr.
hughes
was
domiciled
there?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
things
yet
that
are
still
pending.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
if
we
were
to
decide
that
the
interpleader
action
did
not
properly
lie,
then
how
would
the
circumstances
have
changed
to
entitle
you
to
1251
jurisdiction
here,
in
view
of
our
previous
action?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
if
you
lost
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
have
to
entertain
that
original
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
urge
it
because
it
was
suggested
by
the
concurring
opinion.
unknown
speaker
which
was
not
a
court
opinion.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
to
suggest
that
by
the
process
you
have
just
described,
each
state
ended
up
with
35
percent
of
the
total
estate,
and
there
would
be
no
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
it
would
only
be
if
each
state
or
the
total
of
the
two
exceeded
100
percent,
your
submission
is
that
we
don't
have
any
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
to
be
over
100.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
you
agree
with
mr.
falk
that
domicile
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
constitution
is
not
limited
to
a
single
state.
unknown
speaker
no
federal
constitutional
provision
embodies
that
principle.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
i
guess
all
50
states,
as
i
recall
it,
the
principle
is
that
you
can
have
only
one
domicile.
unknown
speaker
although
it
may
bring
out...
it
could
have
the
same
result
of
one
state.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
that
if
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
district
court
on
remand
must
apply
texas
law?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
apply?
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
federal
common
law
of
domicile?
unknown
speaker
if
not,
we
would
have
to
fashion
one.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
would
the
district
court
if
this
interpleader
action
went
forward.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
law
would
be
applied
if
original
jurisdiction
were
taken?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
is
more
factually
complicated
than
some
of
the
other
original
jurisdiction
cases
the
court
has
had
over
the
years?
unknown
speaker
mr.
harrison,
may
i
just
clear
up
one
thing
in
my
own
mind?
you
are
asking
that
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
be
affirmed,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
are
opposed
to
the
original
action.
you
also
definitely
want
us
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
i
was
a
little
unclear
from
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
want...
do
you
or
do
you
not
want
us
to
affirm
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
to
be
in
that
interpleader.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
gravity
we
should
concern
ourselves
with
is
the
gravity
to
one
of
the
states
if
101
percent
should
be
taxed.
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
gravity
to
the
taxpayer
if
there
is
only
99
percent
taxed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk,
will
you,
before
you
finish
this
point,
answer
your
adversary's
observation
that
apart
from
the
interpleader
suit,
nothing
really
has
happened
since
four
years
ago
that
would
justify
original
jurisdiction
that
didn't
justify
it
then?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
also
true
there
is
not
yet
a
determination
that
there
is
over
100
percent
liability.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would
want
to
sustain
the
interpleader
so
you
could
prove
there
was
a
dispute
between
two
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
still
be
a
dispute
between
two
states.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
but
if
the
interpleader
is...
you
don't
agree
with
the
interpleader.
unknown
speaker
and
one
reason
is
because
these
people
are
the
state.
unknown
speaker
which
means
that
it
is
a
suit
between
two
states.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
destroy
the
interpleader,
which
puts
it
right
back
to
where
it
was
before
there
was
an
interpleader,
which
indicates
that
we
were
wrong
in
the
first
place
in
denying
leave
to
file,
which
i
take
it
you
simply
were
wrong
anyway.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
if
the
interpleader
were
set
aside?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
would
we
purport
to
follow
one
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
or
would
the
interpleader?
unknown
speaker
you
just
say,
one
or
the
other,
or
would
you
say
federal?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
federal
law,
but
you
are
borrowing.
