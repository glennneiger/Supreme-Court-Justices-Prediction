mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
falk
is
quite
right
that
we
are
before
the
court
today
because
of
the
concurring
opinions
in
california
v.
texas.
the
plight
of
the
estate,
which
was
noted
in
those
concurring
opinions,
is
the
same
today
as
it
was
then.
the
estate
is
still
confronted
with
multiple
claims
on
which
we
contend
these
claims
are
based
on
single
obligation.
we
are
not
trying
to
deny
either
set
of
tax
officials
the
full
opportunity
to
try
the
domicile
claims.
we
are
not
trying
to
cut
off
their
right
to
have
an
adjudication
of
their
right
to
assess
and
collect
inheritance
taxes.
we
are
merely
asking
that
they
be
joined
together
in
one
unitary
forum,
and
we
believe
that
the
federal
interpleader
act
provides
us
with
the
mechanism
to
try
it.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
if
the
case
goes
forward,
your
honor,
neither
state
will
be
free
to
go
forward
in
its
state
courts.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
but
both
sets
of
state
officials
will
be
capable
of
going
forward
in
this
interpleader
action.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
oh,
that
is
quite
right,
because
this
unitary
action
will
determine--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--we
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
white.
we
believe
that
the
western
union
case
is
very
similar
in
many
respects
to
this
case.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
it
is
quite
correct
that--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--under
worcester
county
trust
v.
riley,
i
believe
that
is
a
correct
conclusion.
that
was
so
noted
by
the
court.
however,
we
contend
that
the
western
union
v.
pennsylvania
case,
which
was
24
years
after
worcester
county,
has
changed
that
result
at
least
insofar
as
the
worcester
county
court
held
that
there
was
nothing
unconstitutional
about
each
state
taxing
the
same
intangible
assets
of
the
estate,
because
western
union
held
that
when
one
state
goes
forward
to
escheat...
it
was
an
escheat
case...
the
intangibles,
it
cannot
provide
relief
from
a
later
judgment
in
another
state
court
that
that
denied
the
stakeholder
due
process.
we
feel
that
we
are
on
all
fours
with
that
case.
we
have
intangible
assets.
each
state
proposes
to
go
forward.
neither
state
will
submit
to
the
state
courts
of
the
other.
neither
state
can
protect
us
against
the
inconsistent
domicile
determination
of
another
state
court.
and
we
are
not
looking
for
a
windfall
in
this
case,
because
even
if
we
prevail
in
this
interpleader
case,
we
are
going
to
be
taxed
at
the
rate
of
77
percent
total,
and
that
doesn't
include
the
matters
of
interest
which
we
have
alluded
to,
and
that
doesn't
include
the
matter
of
the
california
deductions
if
it
were
determined
to
be
california
domiciled,
to
which
we
are
not
entitled.
mr.
falk
alludes
to
federalism.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we
believe
that
the
ends
of
federalism
would
actually
be
served
and
promoted
by
permitting
us
to
go
forward
with
this
interpleader
action,
because
it
would
give
a
binding
determination,
binding
on
both
the
administrators
of
the
estate
and
on
the
state
tax
officials,
and
it
will
free
them
from
the
burden
of
having
to
race
to
judgment,
a
race
to
collection
in
this
case,
in
which
the
assets
of
the
estate...
the
tax
rate,
the
applicable
tax
rates
in
totality
are
going
to
exceed
the
assets
of
the
estate.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
yes,
sir.
we
have
diversity
between
the
interested
stakeholder,
mr.
lummis,
alvord,
the
county
treasurer.
we
don't
believe
the
change
of
law
affects
the
fact
that
diversity
fixed
as
to
mr.
alvord
at
the
commencement
of
this
suit.
that
change
of
law
may
release
him
from
his
status
as
a
claimant
when
we
get
back
to
the
district
court,
but
that
doesn't
affect
the
fact
that
jurisdiction
was
fixed
because
the
nature
of
the
claim
is
still
the
same.
mr.
cory
has
succeeded
his
rights.
mr.
cory
still
asserts
the
claim
of
california
domicile.
mr.
cory
will
still
attempt
to
collect
the
24
percent.
that
claim
is
still
there.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that
we
have
diversity
jurisdiction
as
between
the
two
sets
of
state
officials,
because,
since
we
have
sued
the
state
officials,
seeking
only
prospective
relief,
the
officials,
we
believe
that
edelman
is
subject
to
that
interpretation,
the
officials
and
not
the
states
are
the
real
parties
in
interest,
and
if
the
officials
are
the
real
parties
in
interest,
they,
like
anyone
else,
they
are
citizens
of
their
state.
the
fourteenth
amendment
tell
us
that,
that
all
persons
are
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
reside.
if
those
officials
are
the
real
parties
in
interest,
we
can
look
to
their--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--i
don't
know.
only
minimal...
is
required--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--well,
but--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--if
he...
if
the
state
is
a
real
party
in
interest,
if
he
brings
an
action
as
a
plaintiff,
suing
for
money
and
damages
on
behalf
of
the
state,
that
is
quite
correct,
but
the
principle
should
be
no
different
whether
you
are
speaking
of
the
eleventh
amendment
or
whether
you
are
speaking
of
diversity,
when
he
is
sued
as
a
defendant
and
only
prospective
relief
is
sought,
because
the
key
test
in
each
instance
is
still
whether
the
state
or
the
official
is
the
real
party
in
interest.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
illegality,
we
have
alleged
that
each
set
of
state
officials
are
acting
illegally
because
it
is
the
law
of
each
state
that
a
decedent
has
only
one
domicile.
we
have
also
alleged
in
our
complaint,
and
this
is
a
bit
technical,
but
it
is
still
the
law,
that
in
passing
on
the
motions
to
dismiss,
which
is,
after
all,
how
this
case
went
up
through
the
appellate
process,
the
district
court
was
obligated
to
accept
as
true
our
assertion
that
mr.
hughes
was
domiciled
in
nevada.
that
is
a
factual
assertion,
and
the
lower
court
was
obligated
to
accept
that.
justice
stevens
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
he
asked
mr.
falk
whether
the
states
are
permitted
to
impose
domicile
based
inheritance
taxes
if
decedents
are
not
in
fact
domiciled
within
the
states.
under
our
assertion,
which
must
be
accepted
as
true,
it
may
turn
out
that
we
are
wrong
on
a
trial
on
the
merits,
but
at
this
preliminary
stage
for
passing
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
it
must
be
accepted
as
true.
neither
set
of
state
officials
is
proceeding
legally
because
it
must
be
accepted
that
mr.
hughes
was
not
domiciled
in
either
of
their
states.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
we
have
none
of
that
in
this
case,
except
in
the
briefs.
each
set
of
state
officials
have
spent
two
or
three
pages
trying
to
argue
their
domicile
cases
in
the
briefs.
we
didn't
feel
that
was
appropriate,
and
no
one
has
challenged,
so
far
as
i
can
recall,
by
way
of
affidavit.
there
certainly
was
no
court
testimony.
there
was
nothing
by
way
of
hearing.
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
our
assertion
that
mr.
hughes
was
domiciled
in
nevada.
mr.
falk
urges
that
edelman
has
made
no
change
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
don't
know.
a
reading
of
edelman,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
a
fair
reading
of
edelman
could
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
if
you
are
suing
only
for
prospective
relief
against
a
state
official,
not
seeking
any
retroactive
relief,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
will
not
be
a
bar.
in
this
case
we
are
not
even
seeking
the
ancillary
type
of
relief
which
impacts
state
treasuries
which
the
court
in
certain
instances
has
permitted.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
your
honor,
section
2361
says
we
can
get
an
injunction,
because
interpleader,
which
is
the
companion
statute
to
1335,
it
says
we
can
enjoin
them
from
going
forward
in
other
forums
other
than
in
this
forum
to
litigate
this
issue.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
of
course,
you
were
the
author,
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
am
not
here
to
quarrel
with
what
you
say
the
case
means,
but
in
the
usual
case,
you
are
always
going
to
have
an
allegation
of
unconstitutionality
or
some
illegality--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--because
otherwise
there
will
be
no
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance
to
get
into
court.
here,
we
say
we
have
that.
we
say
under
western
union
we
have
unconstitutionality,
and
under
the
notion
i
just
described
for
justice
white
we
have
illegality,
but
we
also
have
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
1335,
the
federal
interpleader
statute.
so,
in
the
usual
case,
you
are
going
to
have
allegations
which
would
be
described
as
unconstitutionality
or
illegality.
in
this
instance,
unless
it
is
true,
as
we
mention
in
our
brief,
that
interpleader
carries
with
it
its
own
type
of
wrongdoing,
and
that
wrongdoing
is
the
inability
of
the
stakeholder
to
join
the
two
claimants,
two
or
more
claimants
together
in
one
forum,
and
the
refusal
of
those
claimants
to
join
together
in
one
forum.
but
we
don't
rely
solely
upon
edelman
and
the
fact
that
only
prospective
relief
is
required
in
order
to
avoid
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
have,
as
i
say,
our
unconstitutional
argument,
and
that
is
directly
applicable
to
the
ex
parte
young
series
of
cases
in
which
state
officials
are
stripped
of
their
immunity,
and
they
cannot
assert
the
eleventh
amendment
once
that
immunity
is
stripped,
because
they
and
not
the
states
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
i
would
be
happy
to
comment
on
that.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
if
we
are
wrong,
and
if
the
court
holds
there
is
no
interpleader
jurisdiction
here,
it
seems
to
me
it
will
be
held
on
the
eleventh
amendment
or
on
no
diversity.
such
a
holding
will
carry
with
it
the
suggestion
that
the
states
and
not
the
tax
officials
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
if
the
court
so
holds,
i
agree.
i
believe
at
that
time
the
tax
liens
of
the
two
competing
sets
of
tax
officials
will
be
in
conflict,
and
there
will
be
a
present
controversy.
but
if
we
are
right,
and
if
the
state
officials
in
the
case
as
we
have
structured
it
are
the
real
parties
in
interest,
then
there
is
no
controversy
between
two
states.
the
rule
is
the
same
for
the
eleventh
amendment,
for
diversity,
and
for
original
jurisdiction,
we
submit,
and
that
is
whether
the
states
are
the
real
parties
in
interest
or
the
officials
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
if
we
prevail
in
this
interpleader
action,
that
is
quite
correct.
but
that
comports
with
the
law
of
each
of
those
states
that
a
decedent
has
only
one
domicile
at
death,
justice
white.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
perhaps
that
is
so,
but
neither
set
of
tax
officials
are
going
to
pay
the
other.
their
claims
are
against
the
interpleaded
fund
which
we
hold,
the
intangible
assets
of
the
estate.
neither
one
can
satisfy
its
claim
from
the
other.
but,
as
i
say,
if
the
court
holds
that
the
tax
officials
are
not
the
real
parties
in
interest
in
this
action,
and
if
interpleader
fails,
we
quite
agree
that
at
that
point
there
is
the
controversy
between
the
two
states.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
appeal
pending
in
the
texas
state
courts
which
has
been
stayed
by
that
court
pending
the
determination
of
this
federal
interpleader
matter.
it
was
stayed
way
back
when
we
were
still
in
the
district
court,
and
that
stay
has
continued
to
the
present
time.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
i
don't
see
how
it
relates
to
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
it
may
be
reversed,
and
if
we
have
no
interpleader
relief,
and
if
there
is
no
relief
by
way
of
the
original
jurisdiction,
we
hope
that
it
will
be
reversed,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
a
controversy
between
two
states,
and
if
the
court
so
holds,
that
is
not
affected
in
any
way,
because
the
tax
liens
are
still
impaired.
the
tax
liens
of
the
two
states...
each
set
of
state
tax
officials
asserts
that
it
has
a
lien
on
all
the
intangible
assets
of
the
estate.
those
are
inconsistent
claims.
each
one,
especially
since
the
total
tax
rate
will
exceed
100
percent,
each
one
cannot
fully
satisfy
its
tax
lien.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
no,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
the
reason
for
that
is
because
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
district
court
and
because
of
the
injunction
pending
appeal
from
the
fifth
circuit.
otherwise,
the
report
of
the
california
inheritance
tax
referee
would
have
been
filed.
that
matter
would
have
gone
forward,
and
perhaps
we
would
have
a
domicile
determination
there
now.
but
that
is
one
part
of
the
interpleader
relief
that
we
chose
to
avail
ourselves
of
to
stop
these...
it
is
the
notion
of
vexatious
litigation.
we
could
be
dragged
to
delaware,
perhaps,
when
they
try
to
satisfy,
if
they
get
tax
judgments
under
state
courts,
and
if
we
get
no
relief,
we
may
have
to
litigate
it
again.
that
is
one
reason
for
interpleader
jurisdiction,
to
help
the
stakeholder
avoid
the
vexatious
litigation
and
to
permit
him
to
avoid
the
multiple
liability.
in
the
interpleader
context,
we
don't
have
to
wait
until
there
are
two
judgments
staring
us
in
the
face.
the
fact
that
they
may
claim,
that
they
assert
claims
is
sufficient.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
justice
o'connor,
the
circumstance
would
change
in
that
we
presently
assert
that
we
have
interpleader
jurisdiction,
because
the
states
are
not
the
real
parties
in
interest.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
necessarily,
we
believe,
your
holding
that
there
is
no
interpleader
jurisdiction,
you
would
have
to
be
holding
that
the
states
are
the
real
parties
in
interest,
and
if
the
states
were
the
real
parties
in
interest,
that
latent
controversy
between
the
two
states
because
of
their
inconsistence
liens
would
resurrect
itself.
thank
you.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
that
is
quite
correct,
justice
blackmun.
i
understand
the
notion
of
appropriateness
of
exercise
of
the
court's
original
jurisdiction.
that
is
one
reason
why,
frankly,
we
have
urged
interpleader
as
a
much
more
appropriate
solution
to
the
dilemma
in
which
we
find
ourselves.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
absolutely.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
no,
sir.
that
is
quite
correct.
