mr.
rick
harrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
might
be
so
bold
as
to
inform
the
court
that
mr.
lilienstern
and
i
are
colleagues
in
profession,
but
not
in
parties,
and
our
interests
are
quite
different,
as
my
argument
should
reveal.
your
honors,
four
years
ago
california
brought
texas
before
this
court,
and
texas
postulated
its
position,
let
the
states
alone,
let
them
settle
these
tax
matters
in
their
own
state
courts.
this
matter
is
not
ripe
for
controversy
before
the
court.
as
i
hope
my
argument
should
reveal,
there
is
no
change
of
circumstances
that
has
transpired
during
that
four
years
that
changed
the
factual
unripeness
of
the
estate
that
existed
when
this
court
unanimously
turned
down
california's
motion
to
file
an
original
action.
that
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
we
had
hoped
would
free
texas
to
continue
its
claim
and
allow
california
to
pursue
in
its
own
state
courts
whatever
claim
it
chose
to
pursue
against
the
hughes
estate,
and
whatever
claim
it
could
prove.
but
due
to
the
fact
that
we
have
been
enjoined
by
lower
federal
courts
from
proceeding,
both
states,
there
has
been
no
progress
at
all
in
perfecting
either
state's
position
insofar
as
a
right
to
tax
this
estate.
texas'
position
today
is
as
it
was
four
years
ago.
the
federal
courts,
with
all
due
respect,
should
leave
this
matter
to
the
states,
at
least
until,
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
california
v.
texas,
the
matter
has
ripened
with
determinations
in
favor
of
each
state's
appraisals
of
the
estate
that
reveal
an
inability
of
one
state
to
gain
all
of
its
tax
and
a
sufficient
showing
of
gravity
to
warrant
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
here.
it
is
not
that
texas
is
unmindful
of
or
unsympathetic
with
the
plight
faced
by
an
estate
such
as
the
hughes
estate,
faced
with
two
competing
tax
officials
trying
to
grab
tax
based
on
the
same
basis.
but
no
more
i
would
postulate
than
this
court
is
unsympathetic
with
that
position,
there
simply
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
states
having
domicile
based
inheritance
taxes
and
pursuing
in
their
own
state
courts
the
remedy
against
the
estate
and
applying
the
tax
against
the
estate
if
they
can
perfect
and
prove
the
basis
of
their
claim.
should
this
court
be
of
the
view
that
relief
is
merited
for
states
so
situated,
i
would
suggest
that
the
district
court
interpleader
remedy
is
the
most
suitable
remedy,
and
i
would
cover
the
reasons
for
that
in
just
a
few
moments,
if
i
may.
the
district
court
interpleader
as
postulated
by
the
fifth
circuit
does
permit
the
least
broad
incursion,
federal
incursion
into
the
state
taxing
machinery
in
inheritance
tax.
as
the
court
questioned
counsel,
in
fact,
with
the
disappearance
of
the
county
treasurer
from
the
taxing
scheme,
that
the
case
as
postulated
by
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
likely
to
repeat
itself
jurisdictionally.
more
troublesome
to
the
state
of
texas
is
the
suggestion
that
this
is
a
1251(a)
case,
or
an
appropriate
an
expeditious
case
for
original
action.
simply,
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
in
a
domicile
inheritance
tax
case,
there
are
two
cases.
one
is
a
determination
of
domicile.
the
other
is
an
assessment
of
and
collection
of
tax.
it
is
only
when
you
have
the
domicile
determination
decided
in
a
contradictory
fashion
by
two
or
more
states,
and
then
you
have
an
appraisal
of
the
estate
that
is
finite,
an
assessment
of
taxes
by
the
federal
government
and
these
competing
states,
that
you
begin
to
get
to
the
constitutional
issue,
and
that
is,
is
one
state
grabbing
so
many
of
the
marbles
that
the
other
state
can't
satisfy
its
claim.
and
this
estate
is
far
from
that.
the
appraisals
are
not
complete.
only
the
federal
government
has
rendered
its
appraisal.
we
are
still
litigating--
mr.
rick
harrison
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe--
mr.
rick
harrison
--using
those
percentages
as
an
example,
because
the
federal
tax
also
bears
an
eating
up
of
the
estate,
but
if
we
were
only
talking
about
100
percent
left,
and
the
two
states
took
70
percent,
i
submit
there
would
be
no
federal
question
raised
for
this
court.
mr.
rick
harrison
it
would
have
to
be
over
100
percent,
and
i
would
submit
that
even
if
the
court
were
faced
with
a
factual
analysis
that
showed
it,
that
the
state
of
texas
and
the
state
of
california
had
perfected
their
claims
and
thereby
one
of
the
two
states
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
reach
1
percent
of
its
tax,
then
the
court,
i
believe,
would
still
be
faced
with
the
gravity
test
that
it
applies
in
article
iii
cases,
and
also
in
1251(a)
cases,
and
that
is,
is
that
loss
of
that
1
percent
of
sufficient
gravity
for
the
court
to
take
it.
mr.
rick
harrison
i
believe
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment--
mr.
rick
harrison
--yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
rick
harrison
i
would
not
question
counsel's
representation
that
that
is
nationwide,
but
i
can
advise
the
court
that
in
the
states
of
nevada,
texas,
and
california,
the
domicile
criteria
is
substantially
the
same.
i
might
point
out
that
there
are
different
gradations
of
test
for
domicile
which
i
believe
make
it
necessary
to
allow
the
states
to
make
their
own
determination.
for
example,
in
texas,
we
have
a
different
test,
and
that
is
residents
on
a
permanent
basis
with
no
intention
of
leaving.
california's
is
slightly
different,
present
intention
of
remaining,
and
that
factual
inquiry
is
not
exactly
the
same.
mr.
rick
harrison
yes,
but
the
fiction
the
estate
would
ask
you
to
indulge
is
the
decedent
in
common
law
only
has
one
domicile,
and
that
justifies
proceeding,
and
bringing
these
states
in.
by
that
very
assumption
and
fiction,
texas
postulates...
texas
has
in
this
case
proven
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
jury
in
a
three-month
trial
that
hughes
was
domiciled
in
texas.
i
simply
suggest
that
it
is
unlikely
that
california
can
bear
that
proof,
and
this
court
should
give
it
that
go,
and
allow
california
to
attempt
it
if
they
can,
but
the
situation
will
very
likely
resolve
itself.
mr.
rick
harrison
no.
no,
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
leave
that
impression.
mr.
rick
harrison
this
court
asked
that
same
question
when
the
case
was
here
on
original
action,
asking,
i
believe,
what
this
court
would
apply
if
it
took
the
case
before.
the
court
would
in
that
instance,
i
believe,
apply
the
federal
common
law.
mr.
rick
harrison
i
am
presuming
that
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
harrison
that
might
very
well
be,
and
taking
into
consideration
that
law
in
the
respective
three
states.
mr.
rick
harrison
i
believe...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
harrison
that
is
the
question
i
thought
i
was
responding
to.
mr.
rick
harrison
the
court
would
be
faced
with
that
same
dilemma,
and
i
believe
would
fashion
that
law
that
was
the
best
intermediary
between
the
laws
of
the
competing
states.
on
the
question
of
the
gravity
necessary
to
reach
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
under
either
the
original
bill
or
under
1251(a),
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
in
this
case
in
conjunction
with
the
record
in
the
original
bill
and
that
of
california
v.
texas
does
indicate
that
california
four
years
ago
had
entered
into
a
provisional
settlement
agreement
with
the
estate
agreeing
to
only
take
an
18
percent
tax
as
opposed
to
24
percent.
now
it
postulates
to
this
court
that
it
is
being
aggrieved
at
the
level
which
requires
the
imposition
of
1251(a)
jurisdiction
because
it
may,
if
quite
a
few
different
things
as
yet
unresolved
happen,
only
get
23
of
its
24
percent.
i
simply
point
that
out,
that
just
because
the
fiscal
matters
are
reduced
to
a
finite
conclusion,
and
just
because
a
state
may
lose
1
percent,
the
court
should
still
examine
whether
that
is
of
sufficient
gravity
to
the
estate...
or
to
the
state.
exactly
the
type
of
a
gravity
question
that
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
the
recent
case
of
maryland
versus
louisiana,
that
you
must
look
to
the
gravity
of
the
situation.
furthermore,
i
would
point
out,
in
the
court
looking
at
its
original
jurisdiction,
under
either
article
iii
or
section
1251(a),
there
are
alternate
forms
available.
first
of
all,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
just
this
last
august,
an
appearance
by
the
state
of
california
was
allegedly
made
by
the
state...
was
allegedly
made
in
the
state
probate
court
in
houston,
texas.
therefore,
at
this
very
time,
all
the
parties
to
this
proceeding
have
appeared,
we
allege,
in
the
texas
probate
court,
and
that
court
has
personal
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
if
not
that
forum,
then
certainly
we
have
the
alternate
forums
of
the
state
courts
in
both
california
and
texas,
which
i
ask
you,
as
we
asked
you
four
years
ago,
to
allow
to
proceed
in
this
matter.
there
is
a
policy
reason,
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
preach
policy
to
this
court,
but
as
i
glean
some
of
the
reasons
the
court
has
given
for
not
exercising
its
original
jurisdiction
in
the
past,
one
that
is
especially
relevant
to
a
domicile
determination
that
is
such
a
heavily
factual
matter,
the
literal
investigation
of
a
man's
life,
this
court
has
pronounced
that
it
is
ill-equipped
to
sit
as
a
factfinder
at
the
trial
level,
it
is
ill-equipped
to
try
such
cases,
and
it
could
not
accord
to
the
litigants
her
what
i
would
perceive
to
be
their
constitutional
right
to
jury
trial.
mr.
rick
harrison
i
certainly
wouldn't
presume
to
so,
but
it
is
a
virtual
factual
nightmare,
as
illustrated
the
length
of
the
texas
trial
that
has
already
gone
before
and
i
would
just
submit
that
the
litigants
should
be
entitled
to
the
trial
level
investigation
of
those
facts
a
trial
before
a
jury.
mr.
rick
harrison
i
am
asking
that
the
state
of
texas...
that
the
fifth
circuit
be
reversed,
and
that
there
be
federal
jurisdiction.
i
say
if
you
believe,
though,
that
the
estate
merits
relief,
that
it
not
be
original
action
1251(a),
but--
mr.
rick
harrison
--your
honor--
mr.
rick
harrison
--the
state
of
texas
did
not
appeal
the
fifth
circuit
decision,
and
i
appreciate
your
question,
because
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
explain
that.
that
decision
became
final
almost
exactly
one
year
ago,
but
three
years
after
we
were
here
asking
to
be
left
alone.
we
were
looking
at
a
fifth
circuit
decision
that
had
drawn
an
incursion
by...
via
the
edelman
doctrine
and
into
our
eleventh
amendment
protection
very,
very
narrowly,
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
questions,
one
that
would
not
likely
ever
happen
again.
we
were
also
faced
with
four
justices
of
this
court
in
a
concurring
opinion
indicating
agreement
with
what
the
fifth
circuit
had
done
a
matter,
quite
frankly,
of
expediency,
of
putting
some
conclusion
to
this
long
litigation...
mr.
hughes
has
now
been
dead
six
years...
we
brought
no
appeal
of
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
mr.
rick
harrison
the
state
of
texas
does
not
want
an
affirmance.
we
do
not
want--
mr.
rick
harrison
--we
don't
want
to
be
in
federal
court,
your
honor.
my
summary
should
cover
what
i
have
just
said,
that
the
state
of
texas'
position
is,
leave
the
states
alone,
and
don't
encumber
your
original
jurisdiction
with
this
type
of
case
until
it
is
so
factually
finite
that
there
is
a
true
harm
to
the
states
with
the
gravity
required
and
no
alternate
form
available.
mr.
rick
harrison
that
is
right.
