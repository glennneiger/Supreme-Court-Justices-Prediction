unknown
speaker
mr.
schaaf,
what
is
the
status,
if
you
know,
of
the
appeals
in
the
state
court
on
the
convictions
themselves?
unknown
speaker
does
the
nebraska
supreme
court
not
clear
its
appellate
dockets
each
term?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
normal
and
usual
for
it
to
take
12
months
to
hear
this
case?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
the
nebraska
supreme
court
opinion,
the
merits
don't
involve
this
provision,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
then
why
would
they
possibly
be
waiting
for
us?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
he
would
be
entitled
to
bail
if
there
were
no
such
constitutional
provision?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
the
constitutional
provision
has
any
effect
on
his
bailability
or
whatever
you
might
call
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
apart
from
financial
means,
are
there
other
grounds
on
which
nebraska
might
deny
someone
who
is
convicted,
or
is
charged
with
an
offense
such
as
this
bail?
unknown
speaker
and
there
are
no
provisions
in
any
case
if
a
man
is
known
to
be
extremely
dangerous,
or
that
he
still
gets
bail
automatically
in
every
case,
unless
it
is
treason
or
murder?
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
us
that
if
a
defendant
is
brought
before
the
court
in
whatever
preliminary
process
you
have
in
the
state
of
nebraska,
and
it
is
clear
that
he
is
awaiting
trial
on
five
indictments,
let
us
say,
all
serious
felonies,
violent
crimes,
that
the
judge
may
not
take
that
into
account
in
denying
bail
totally?
unknown
speaker
without
this.
unknown
speaker
are
you
representing,
entitled
to
be
released
on
a
reasonable
bail?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
bailable
in
your
constitutional
amendment,
where
applicable,
not
bailable.
that
is
not
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
you
are
telling
us?
unknown
speaker
has
your
supreme
court
held
this?
unknown
speaker
now
i
gather
you
are
telling
us
we
should
decide
this
case
on
the
premise
that
for
any
offense,
there
is
always
judicial
discretion
to
admit
the
bail?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
nebraska
supreme
court
reviewed
any
cases
where
bail
is
denied?
if
there
is
discretion
to
grant
it,
has
it
reviewed
any
cases
where
it
is
denied,
and
said
that
the
discretion
was
abused
by
not
granting
it?
or
is
it
just
a...
is
it
ever
reviewed?
unknown
speaker
has
it
been?
unknown
speaker
but
has
it
said
what
factors
go
into
the
denial
of
bail?
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
has
got
discretion
to
grant
it.
i
would
suppose
there
may
have
some
law
grow
up
down
through
the
years,
at
least
on
the
murder.
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
we
know,
the
decision
of
the
trial
judge
is
final
with
respect
to
whether
bail
should
be
allowed
at
all
or
not.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
course
of...
was
an
opinion
written
anywhere
in
this
appeal
on
bail
and
whether
bail
was--
unknown
speaker
--was
improperly
denied?
unknown
speaker
did
they
also
say
that
bail
was
properly
denied?
unknown
speaker
for
what
reason?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
just
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
then
that
is
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and
also
the
decision
to
deny
bail
is
then
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier,
however,
that
the
trial
judge
could
have
granted
bail
as
a
matter
of
discretion
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask,
is
there
an
individualized
determination
then
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
one
makes
an
application
for
bail.
i
gather
the
state
would
come
in,
would
it--
unknown
speaker
--or
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
question...
and
say,
this
individual
won't
show
up
for
trial,
or
may
be
a
danger
to
the
community,
something
like
that.
does
the
state
have
that
burden?
unknown
speaker
what
does
"presumption
is
great"
mean?
presumption
of
guilt
is
great?
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
accused
is
one
who
will
or
won't
show
up
for
trial,
or
whether
or
not
if
released
he
will
be
a
danger
to
the
community?
neither
of
them,
then,
is
inquired
into?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
he
makes
the
determination,
presumption
is
great,
as
you
tell
it,
meaning
that
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
very
strong.
does
he
then
bother
going
on
into
whether
or
not
the
accused
may
show
up?
unknown
speaker
and
he
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--well,
really
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
the
state
makes
any
effort
in
addition
to
showing
that
the
presumption
of
guilt
is
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
and
no
requirement
expressed,
at
least,
that
he
inquire
into
whether
or
not
he
has
had
a
past
record
of
not
showing
up
when
he
has
been
admitted
to
bond,
or
that
he
is
a
danger
to
the
community?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
before
you
go
on,
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
first
point,
if
i
may.
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
two
of
three
counts,
or--
unknown
speaker
--three
out
of
four.
was
that
after
jury
trials?
unknown
speaker
factual
trials
on
each
of
the
counts?
unknown
speaker
and
he
filed
appeals
in
each?
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
is
there
one
conviction
from
which
he
has
not
appealed
at
all?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
did
i
gather
from
an
earlier
comment,
counsel,
that
you
don't
agree
with
judge
arnold's
opinion
on
mootness
in
the
eighth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
1983?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
very
likely
to
repeat
itself?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
get
beyond
nebraska
press
association,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
has
to
be,
under
weinstein
against
bradford,
it
has
to
be
the
same
person
on
each
side
that
has
suffered
from
the
inability
to
have
a
review.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
agree
that
is
very
unlikely,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
this
was
not
filed
as
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
how
about,
counsel,
after
conviction
in
a
criminal
case,
is
anyone
entitled
to
bail
while
his
case
is
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
that
this
statute
would
prevent
bail
while
the
case
is
pending
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
it
moot
until
it
is
decided?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
it
doesn't
need
repetition,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
if
this
statute,
if
this
constitutional
amendment
was
declared
unconstitutional,
he
could
apply
for
bail
now.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
in
theory,
at
least,
it
could
be
granted
now
by
the
same
judge
who
denied
by
before
on
the
basis
of
perhaps
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schaaf,
is
there
not
a
different
statutory
provision
covering
bail
after
someone
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
pending
appeal?
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
me
that
you
would
go
back
this
same
provision,
or
would
there
not
be
other
provisions
in
nebraska
law
that
govern
that--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
separate
statutory
provisions,
however,
dealing
with
bail
pending
appeal.
is
that
correct?
or
release
pending
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
mr.
schaaf,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
you.
apart
from
the
constitutional
provision,
there
is
a
statute
governing
the
allowance
of
bail
in
most
cases.
are
there
exceptions
in
the
statute
itself?
there
are
some
situations
other
than
capital
cases
and
the
sex
offense
cases
in
which
the
trial
judge
may
pursuant
to
that
statute
deny
bail?
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
earlier,
then.
i
thought
you
said
there
was
a
statute
that
was
not
limited
to
cases
where
people
had
been
convicted,
which
might
operate
to
deny
this
man
bail
entirely
apart
from
the
constitution.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
a
person
convicted
of
robbery
who
appeals?
does
he
automatically
get
bail?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
statute
dealing
only
with
people
who
have
been
convicted.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
statute
that
would
provide
the
basis
for
denial
of
bail
to
this
man
if
we
disregarded
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
let
me
sure
i
track
that
now,
counsel.
a
man
is
brought
in,
charged
with
embezzlement
from
a
bank.
could
the
judge
on
making
appropriate
findings
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
of
flight,
assume
that
there
was
some
evidence,
and
he
made
findings
that
because
of
the
likelihood
of
flight
for
whatever
reasons
he
describes,
he
is
denying
bail.
could
he
do
that?
unknown
speaker
i
beg
your
pardon?
unknown
speaker
prior
to
conviction,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can't
he
set
bail?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
all
are
bailable.
that
is
the
section
you
are
relying
on.
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
not
for
that
section,
all
are
entitled
to
bail,
then
a
judge
could
deny
bail.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
form
of
the
proceeding
at
which
the
determination
is
made
that
the
proof
is
evident
or
the
presumption
great?
unknown
speaker
what
happened
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
counsel,
here
there
was
a
stipulation,
was
there
not--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
proof
was
evident
and
the
presumption
great?
unknown
speaker
are
those
different
things,
proof
evident
and
presumption
great?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
stipulate
to
something,
are
you
in
any
position
to
attack
it
later?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
agree
to
it,
by
definition,
you
have
understood
it,
haven't
you?
unknown
speaker
if
you
didn't
know
what
it
means--
unknown
speaker
--how
do
you
account
for
having
agreed
to
it?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
think
it
meant
when
you--
unknown
speaker
--counsel,
are
you
representing
the
defendant
in
the
appeal
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
and
have
you
delayed
filing
the
briefs
there
so
that
this
court
can
determine
it
in
an
effort
to
keep
it
from
being
moot?
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
referred
to
the
fact
that
you
represented
to
the
judge
on
the
bail
hearing
that
he
had
a
minimal
prior
criminal
record.
what
did
that
constitute?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
hornstein,
i
can
understand
your
wanting
to
get
a
test
case,
which
i
guess
motivates
the
stipulation,
but
supposing
this
constitutional
standard
is
the
equivalent
of
saying
there
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
man
is
guilty?
it
may
mean
that,
for
all
we
know.
unknown
speaker
no,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
then
couldn't
they
detain
him
if
it
means
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
haven't
excluded
the
possibility
that
that
is
what
it
means,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
that
is
what
it
means,
you
have
no
valid
objection
to
having
the
man
held
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
presumption
or
the
proof
is
evident?
which?
unknown
speaker
but
the
language
is,
where
the
proof
is
evident
or
the
presumption
great.
are
they
different
things?
unknown
speaker
the
problem
with
stipulating
so
you
get
a
test
case
in
a
hurry
is
that
you
ask
us
to
decide
something
before
we
know
what
it
means,
whereas
if
you
litigated
these
issues,
then
your
courts
would
have
to
decide
what
this
means.
you
have
rushed
to
get
us
a
test
case,
is
what
you
have
done
here.
unknown
speaker
and
we
still
don't
know
what
this
standard
means.
unknown
speaker
has
there
ever
been
a
contested
hearing
in
nebraska
at
which
the
issue
has
been
whether
or
not
there
was
this
kind
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
how
often
could
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
this
very
case,
though,
on
the
review
by
the
district
court
of
the
denial
or
whatever
it
was
by
the
magistrate,
could
you
not
have
insisted
that
he
was
entitled
to
bail
because
the
state
had
not
proved
either
that
the
proof
was
evident
or
the
presumption
great,
whatever
those
things
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
you
would
have
framed
the
issue--
unknown
speaker
--any
legislative
history
where
this
came
from?
unknown
speaker
no,
where
that,
where
the
proof
is
evident
or
the
presumption
great.
certainly
those
are
not
novel.
i
have
seen
those
other
places.
i
don't
know
what
they
mean,
but
i
have
seen
them.
unknown
speaker
how
many
states
follow
that
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
counsel--
--yes,
but
what
if
at
the
hearing
the
defendant
testified
that
he
would
if
he
were
let
go?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
unconstitutional
to
say,
well,
we
won't
let
you
go
then?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
supposing
you
did
have
a
hearing,
supposing
you
had
a
hearing--
unknown
speaker
--under
this
amendment,
and
the
man
denied
his
guilt
as
to
this
crime,
but
said,
if
i
go
free,
i
intend
to
commit
a
rape
as
soon
as
i
walk
out
the
door.
unknown
speaker
has
that
been
determined
by
the
nebraska
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
your
basic
position
is
that
your
1978
amendment
violates
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
you
mentioned
earlier
the
1789
capital
crimes
exception
in
the
1789
statute.
do
you
think
that,
under
your
submission
as
to
the
nebraska
provision,
do
you
think
that
also
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
then
the
idea
that
he
would
go
out
and
commit
another
murder?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
cut
in
a
little
bit
to
your
idea
that
the
forcible
rape
addition
has
to
be
justified
by
a
finding
that
the
person
would
go
out
and
commit
another
rape?
unknown
speaker
but
your
client
is
one
step
beyond
the
pretrial
detention
stage.
he
is
now
in
the
post-conviction
appeal
stage.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
your
opposing
counsel
that
there
is
a
separate
system
of
setting
bail
for
people
who
have
already
been
convicted?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
this
constitutional
amendment
be
a
basis
for
denying
bail
pending
appeal?
unknown
speaker
however
the
factors
might
sort
out
under
the
other
statute,
this
would
be
independently
a
reason
for
denying
bail?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
as
long
as
the
case
is
pending,
this
case
isn't
moot,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
we
don't
necessarily
take
your
word
for
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hornstein--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
even
need
to
get
to
nebraska
press.
unknown
speaker
if
we
overturned
the
statute,
he
could
apply
for
bail,
pending
appeal.
unknown
speaker
he
may
not
get
it,
but
at
least
the
constitutional
barrier
to
bail
would
be
removed.
unknown
speaker
yes.
even
though
you
stipulated
that
the
proof
is
evident
or
the
presumption
great?
unknown
speaker
if
we
turned
that
over,
that
would
be
gone.
unknown
speaker
so
even
if
he
has
been
convicted,
then,
if
we
overturn
this
provision,
he
is
out
on
bail.
is
that
right?
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
danger
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
should
or
shouldn't
be?
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
the
discretion
that
the
judge
had
on
this
record
is
it
any
different
from
what
it
would
be
if
he
had
three
outstanding
indictments,
separate
indictments
not
being
tried
together
for
forcible
rapes?
unknown
speaker
if
he
had
had
convictions
of
three
before
he
came
before
the
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hornstein,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
that
relates
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
suppose
there
were
no
constitutional
provision,
again,
you
merely
have
your
bail
statute,
which
as
i
understand
you
says
that
there
is
an
inquiry
into
the
probability
of
flight.
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
judge
had
a
bail
hearing
without
the
constitutional
provision
him
at
all,
said
this
man
has
been
indicted
on
four
serious
charges,
i
think
he
is
sure
to
flee
if
he
can,
and
the
guy
testifies
he
is
going
to
flee.
does
he
still
get
bail?
unknown
speaker
the
way
they
prevent
him
from
fleeing
is
by
fixing
excessive
bail?
is
that
what
you
do?
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
be
up
on
another
constitutional
basis.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
to
give
excessive
bail.
unknown
speaker
you
know
it,
and
you
go
right
ahead
and
do
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hornstein,
may
i
just
get
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you?
do
i
understand
now,
based
on
what
you
said
about
pre-revolutionary
history
and
blackstone
and
everything
else,
that
you
do
think
the
capital
crimes
exception
in
the
1789
statute
is
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
since
you
concede
that,
what
real
difference
is
there
between
this
nebraska
provision
and
that
one,
in
terms
of
constitutionality?
unknown
speaker
so
in
a
state
which
has
abolished
capital
punishment,
it
would
be
your
view
that
then
there
could
be
no
denial
of
bail.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
states?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
am
pushing
you
to
get
to
those
issues.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
hornstein?
if
you
are
right
that
you
constitutional
amendment
creates
an
irrebuttable
presumption
as
to
people
who
fell
between
them,
wouldn't
you
argue,
or
do
you
argue
that
under
a
due
process
analysis
in
any
event
the
provision
is
unconstitutional,
without
reaching
the
question
of
whether
the
eighth
amendment
extends
the
excessive
bail--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
hornstein,
doesn't
that
analysis
make
the
eighth
amendment
meaningless
in
this
context?
unknown
speaker
what
about
carlson
and
landon?
unknown
speaker
it
addressed
the
eighth
amendment,
though,
as
to
how
broad
it
was.
and
it
said
expressly
that
it
did
not
prevent
the
denial
of
bail.
unknown
speaker
just
as
clear
as
it
could
be.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
dictum?
it
was
a
holding,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was...
one
of
the
submissions
was
that
the
eighth
amendment
prevented
the
denial
of
bail.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
the
eighth...
it
could
be
the
circumstances,
but
if
the
eighth
amendment...
but
nevertheless
in
those
circumstances
the
eighth
amendment
permitted
the
denial
of
bail.
unknown
speaker
and
not
just
excessive
bail,
denial
of
bail.
it
permitted
making
a
non-capital
case
non-bailable.
unknown
speaker
well,
nevertheless,
it
did.
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
them
took
issue
with
the
eighth
amendment
dictum
or
holding?
only
two.
justice
frankfurter--
unknown
speaker
--burton
and
black
did.
douglas
didn't
address
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
is
a
difference,
if
there
is
a
difference
between
an
administrative
grant
or
denial
of
bail
and
a
judicial
grant
or
denial,
as
to
which
do
you
think
the
standards
would
be
the
higher?
unknown
speaker
an
administrative
denial
of
bail
is
more
readily
granted
than
judicial
denial
of
bail?
unknown
speaker
general,
you
have
argued
that
section
9
does
not
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
is
there
any
authority
for
that
in
nebraska
cases?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
of
the
applicability
of
the
eighth
amendment,
of
this
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
states?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
fourteenth
amendment,
if
we
were
reviewing
it
from
that
aspect,
imposes
any
requirement
for
an
individualized
determination,
apart
from
the
eighth
amendment
considerations?
unknown
speaker
how
many
do
you
have
on
death
row?
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
the
significance
of
your
comment?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
give
us
you
final
quote,
so
it
won't
take
it
out
of
order?
do
you
agree
with
the
suggestion
that
i
get
from
both
of
you,
or
do
i
correctly
understand
now
that
if
in
this
case
the
trial...
say
there
had
been
a
bail
hearing,
and
we
didn't
have
the
constitutional
provision,
and
the
trial
judge
had
determined
that
this
man
had
been
charged
a
number
of
serious
times
with
a
substantial
risk
of
flight,
that
he
could
have
prevented
him
from
being
released
on
bail
by
setting
a
very
high
bail
that
he
knew
the
man
could
not
meet?
that
would
be
something
that
would
be
done
from
time
to
time
in
nebraska?
unknown
speaker
so
that
we
don't
really
know,
do
we,
whether,
although
this
man
might
have
formally
been
entitled
to
bail,
say,
$10
million
or
something,
we
really
don't
know
apart
from
this
stipulation
whether
this
man
would
have
been
released,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
know
if
we
have
a
live
case
here.
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
know
about
this
particular
man.
really,
from
what
we
have
head
about
it,
he
has
been
convicted
of
four
crimes,
or
three
crimes,
very
serious
in
nature.
the
judge
might
well,
apart
from
this
stipulation,
have
followed
a
procedure
which
would
have
denied
him
release
entirely
apart
from
this
constitutional
provision.
unknown
speaker
no,
he
could
have
granted
him
a
bail,
but
denied
him
release,
because
he--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
your
friend
has
quoted
the
same
material
in
support
of
his
position.
