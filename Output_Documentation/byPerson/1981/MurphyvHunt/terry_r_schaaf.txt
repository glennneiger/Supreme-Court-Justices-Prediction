mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
june
of
1977,
an
individual
raped
a
young
lady
at
a
resort
in
central
nebraska.
one
day
later,
that
individual
was
arrested
and
bond
was
set
at
$10,000.
in
september
of
that
year,
that
individual
pled
guilty.
bond
was
continued
pending
sentencing.
three
days
later,
that
same
individual,
while
free
on
bond,
raped
again,
and
this
time
killed
his
victim.
in
january
of
that
very
next
year,
in
1978,
the
nebraska
legislature
proposed
an
amendment
to
article
i,
section
9
of
the
nebraska
constitution.
prior
to
the
time
of
the
proposal
of
that
amendment,
article
i,
section
9,
had
withheld
from
persons
charged
with
murder
and
treason
the
right
to
demand
bail
pending
trial.
the
amendment
proposed
the
addition
of
the
crime
of
forcible
rape.
at
the
general
election
in
november
of
1978,
the
people
of
the
state
of
nebraska,
by
a
vote
of
356,000
in
favor
to
80,000
opposed,
adopted
this
amendment.
in
may
of
1980,
mr.
hunt,
the
appellee
herein,
was
arrested
and
charged
with
multiple
counts
of
forcible
rape,
and
the
commission
of
that
crime
with
the
use
of
a
firearm.
in
september
of
1980,
he
was
convicted
of
a
number
of
those
charges,
and
sentenced
to
consecutive
terms
of
confinement
of
a
maximum
of
50
years
and
a
minimum
of
29.
in
june
of
1980,
he
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
of
the
district
of
nebraska
a
habeas
corpus
action
naming
the
judge
as
the...
excuse
me,
the
sheriff
as
the
respondent,
and
at
the
same
time
filed
in
that
court
a
civil
rights
action
naming
judge
murphy,
the
appellant
herein,
as
the
defendant.
in
october
of
1980,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
unanimously
or...
excuse
me...
in
both
cases,
one
judge
held
that
that
nebraska
constitutional
provision
was
constitutional
in
all
respects.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
and
in
may
of
1981,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
in
the
habeas
corpus
action
the
matter
was
moot,
and
with
reference
to
the
civil
rights
action,
reversed
the
lower
court,
and
held
that
the
nebraska
constitutional
provision
violated
both
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
this
appeal
was
thereafter
taken.
in
october,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
your
honor,
the
convictions
themselves
were
appealed
in
both...
in
all
three
cases
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
and
all
three
of
those
appeals
are
currently
pending.
briefs
have
not
yet
been
filed
by
the
appellant.
it
would
be
expected
that
that
case
would
not
be
resolved
probably
in
the
next
12
months.
your
honors,
a
violent
crime
occurs--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
they
do
try
to
give
priority
to
criminal
appeals.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
it
would
not
be
normal
and
usual
for
it
to
take
another
additional
12
months
from
this
date
to
hear
this
case.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
this
is
a
bit
irregular,
although
i
do
suspect
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
is
extremely
anxious
to
learn
of
this
court's
opinion
of
the
constitutionality
of
our
constitutional
amendment.
it
may
be
that
that
has
some
bearing
on
the
rapidity
with
which
they
are
reaching
this
particular
case.
your
honors,
a
violent
crime
occurs
in
this
country
every
24
seconds.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
it
very
well
might
be
that
if
they
ruled
against
the
appellee
in
this
case,
we
might
have
a
question
of
mootness,
your
honor.
the
eighth
circuit
struggled
with
that
problem.
under
nebraska
press
association
versus
stewart,
it
is
our
position
that
so
long
as
mr.
hunt
stands
in
a
position
where
this
matter
is
capable
of
repetition,
that
being
if
the
nebraska
supreme
court
would
reverse
his
convictions
and
put
him
back
in
a
position
where
he
was
at
the
inception,
he
would
still
be
subject
to
this
constitutional
amendment,
and
therefore
it
is
not
moot.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
i
don't
know
that--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--i
am
not
certain
that
the
record
reflects
whether
or
not
he
has
the
financial
means
to
meet
a
reasonable
bail.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor.
article
i,
section
9,
only
permits
the
withholding
of
the
right
to
bail
in
cases
of
murder
and
treason.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
unless
that
amount
of
bail
is
set
beyond
his
reach.
it
very
well
may
be
in
the
case
of
an
extremely
dangerous
individual,
an
extremely
high
bail
could
be
justified,
effectively
thereby
restraining
him
from
being
dangerous.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
without
the
assistance
of
this
constitutional
provision--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--i
do
not
believe
that
he
could.
not
under
nebraska's
constitutional
scheme
nor
statutory
scheme.
there
again,
it
may
be
that
a
$1
million
bond
would
be
entirely
reasonable
in
such
a
situation,
and
it
may
be
that
a
particular
defendant
could
not
make
that
bond.
but
absent
this
statute,
this
constitutional
provision,
persons
charged
with
heinous
crimes
such
as
forcible
rape
are
entitled
under
our
constitution
to
demand
bail.
with
this
constitutional
provision,
the
judge
is
still
free
to
grant
bail.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
in
our
situation
the
constitutional
amendment
merely
withholds
the
right
to
demand
bail.
it
does
not
prohibit
the
trial
judge
from
granting
bail
in
certain
circumstances.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor.
we
are
suggesting--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
not
directly
considered
that
question.
i
can
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
in
fact
the
practice.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
constitutional
provision
covers
murder,
not
first
degree
murder,
not
murder
where
capital
punishment
is
appropriate,
and
with
great
regularity,
and
for
scores
of
years,
persons
charged
with
lesser
degrees
of
murder
have
been
entitled
to
bail
under
the
same
constitutional
provision.
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
amicus
briefs
that
the
decision
in
parker
versus
roth
somehow
holds
against
this
position.
parker
versus
roth
was
the
first
test
of
this
constitutional
provision
that
was
taken
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
the
nebraska
supreme
court
unanimously
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
this
constitutional
amendment.
an
appeal
was...
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
taken
to
this
court
which
was
not
granted.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
whether
we
are
talking
murder,
treason,
or
one
of
the
degrees
of
first
degree
sexual
assault,
forcible
rape.
it
is
not
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
i
would
direct
this
court's
attention
to
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
mccowan
in
parker
versus
roth,
wherein
i
think
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
it
is
not
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
i
would
also
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
actual
language
of
chief
justice
krivosha,
some
of
the
language
that
has
been
cited
to
you
by
the
amicus,
and
in
that
situation
we
believe
that
all
the
chief
justice
is
speaking
there
is
indicta.
he
is
talking
about
ineligibility
for
bail,
not
a
prohibition
against
bail.
i
think
that
is
a
critical
element
of
this
case.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
bail
certainly
could
be
reviewed.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
it
has
been
in
the
context
of
excessive
bail,
and
it
has
been
in
one
instance
in
the
context
of
whether
or
not
the
court
is
free
to
exercise
some
discretion,
and
i
guess
the
citation
to
that
would
be
partin,
p-a-r-t-i-n,
versus
jensen,
203
nebraska
441.
partin
versus
jensen,
203
nebraska
441,
wherein
the
nebraska
supreme
court
held
the
inherent
power
of
a
court
may
be
exercised
as
to
bail
although
it
is
not
specifically
vested
by
statute.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
your
honor,
where--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--no,
your
honor,
not
with
reference
to
that.
now,
of
course,
we
do
have
a
statutory
scheme
for
setting
bail
once
bail
is
to
be
set.
in
other
words,
to
determine,
once
we
have
cleared
the
hurdle
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--it
is
not
final,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
bail
was
originally
denied
by
a
municipal
judge.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
and
that
was
reviewed
by
a
trial
level
district
court
judge.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
and
thereafter,
an
appeal
is
possible
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
and
that
is
what
happened
in
parker
versus
roth.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
there
was
an
opinion
written
in--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--there
was
an
opinion
written
in
parker
versus
roth
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
withholding
the
bail
in
this
case.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
because
he
was
charged
with
first
degree
sexual
assault.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
of
course...
yes,
your
honor,
presuming
that
the
finding
could
be
made
that
the
proof
is
evident
and
the
presumption
is
great.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
that
is
the
end
of
the
constitutional
scheme.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
as
far
as
the
requirement
of
a
trial
judge
articulating
his
reasons
for
denying
bail
even
thereafter,
i
am
aware
of
no
authority
which
requires
him
to
articulate
those
reasons.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
he
elects
to
make
bail
available,
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
wherein
he
must
determine
what
kind
of
bail,
if
bail
at
all
is
to
be
imposed.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor,
as
well
as
in
cases
of
murder.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no...
well,
i
presume
so,
your
honor.
there
is
no
statutory--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
when
we
are
talking
about
persons
charged
with
either
murder
of
forcible
rape,
the
first
obligation
is
to
establish
that
the
proof
is
evident
and
the
presumption
is
great.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor.
i
suspect
it
means
something
considerably
more
than
a
preponderance
of
evidence
and
something
less
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
what
the
trial
judge
must
find
is
that
the
evidence
is
clear
and
convincing,
and
that
the
defendant
will
probably
be
convicted.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
both
of
those
are
factors
which
the
judge
may
or
may
not
make
an
actual
inquiry
into.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
there
is
no
constitutional
or
statutory
requirement
that
he
do
so.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
it
is
impossible
to
know
what
he
may
articulate
mentally
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
exercise
his
discretion--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--on
a
case
by
case
basis,
they
no
doubt
do.
they
may
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
this
man
has
a
long
previous
criminal
record.
they
may
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
he
has
not
responded...
returned
from
bond
on
previous
occasions.
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
make
such
a
showing.
if
they
wish
to
impose
bond,
they
must
establish
that
his
guilt
is
evident
and
the
presumption
of
his
guilt
great
to
the
trial
judge's
satisfaction.
with
regard
to
the
irrebuttable
presumption,
even
if
they
do,
the
judge
may
still
exercise
his
discretion
to
grant
bail.
if
he
makes
that
election,
then
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
he
must
follow
to
determine
the
kind
of
bail
and
the
amount
of
bail
which
would
be
appropriate.
there
is
no
requirement
that
he
articulate
the
decision-making
process
of
whether
or
not
he
will
exercise
that
discretion.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
if
he
feels
that
he
can
find
that
the
proof
is
evident,
the
presumption
is
great,
without
doing
so,
from
the
face
of
the
evidence,
he
need
not
inquire
further.
your
honors,
in
this--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--three
of
four,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
he
did
actually
confess
to
the
crimes,
but
he
then
pled
not
guilty.
there
was
a
jury
trial.
he
was
ultimately
only
brought
to
trial
on
three
of
the
four
rapes.
the
reason
he
was
not
brought
to
trial
on
the
other,
i
understand,
is
that
the
prosecutrix
lived
out
of
state.
the
prosecution
was
satisfied
that
they
could
get
convictions
on
the
three,
and
didn't
bother
reporting
that
prosecutrix
for
that
fourth
trial.
he
was
also
charged
in
each
one
of
those
three
rapes
with
the
use
of
a
firearm
in
the
commission
of
a
felony.
he
was
only
found
guilty
of
one
of
those
charges.
of
course,
those
charges
would
not
have
been
non-bailable
charges
in
any
event.
but
he
was
found
guilty
of
three
first
degree
sexual
assaults,
one
upon
a
child,
two
upon
adults,
and
one
count
of
use
of
a
felony
in
the
commission
of
a
firearm.
he
was
given
consecutive
sentences
that
total
a
maximum
of
50
years,
a
minimum
of
29.
he
will
be
eligible
for
parole
after
15
years.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
there
were...
actually
two
of
the
cases
were
combined
on
appeal.
one
was
not.
there
are
two
appeals
pending
before
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
and
of
course
at
the
same
time
he
filed
these
two
actions
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska.
actually,
before
he
was
even
found
guilty,
he
filed
these
actions.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
ma'am.
all
of
his
convictions
are
presently
on
appeal
before
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
i
don't
have
any
question
about
it
with
reference
to
the
habeas
corpus
action,
just
for
no
other
reason
than
mr.
hunt
is
no
longer
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
of
douglas
county,
but
with
reference
to--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--yes,
with
reference
to
the
1983
action,
we
believe
that
the
standards
of
nebraska
press
association
versus
stewart
can
be
met,
that
it
is
capable
of
repetition,
and
therefore
it
is
not
moot.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
extremely
likely.
the
convictions
in
my
opinion
are
sound.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
of
course,
i
am
not
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
they
very
well
may
find
errors
that
have
been
committed
there.
it
is
still
theoretically
possible.
it
is
still
theoretically
possible
that
mr.
hunt
can
be
placed
back
in
the
same
position
he
was
at
the
inception
of
these
actions.
of
course,
this
certainly
is
something
that
is
capable
of
evading
review,
if
there
were
ever
an
issue
that
would
evade
review,
it
would
be
an
issue
such
as
this.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
we
suggest
in
this
case
that
it
is.
mr.
hunt
is
perfectly
capable
of
being
placed...
legally
capable
of
being
placed
back
in
the
same
position
that
he
was,
and
that
would
result
from
a
finding
of
any
kind
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
of
any
kind
of
a
deficiency
in
those
convictions
requiring
a
remand
and
the
potential
for
recharge.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
the
success
rate
before
the
nebraska
supreme
court
is
extremely
low
in
all
cases.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
we
suggest
that
it
is
not.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
if
he
made
application
tomorrow--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--yes,
your
honor,
and
he
could
be
denied
bail
independent
of
this
constitutional
provision--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
there
is
a--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--you
could
go
back
to
this
same
provision,
or
you
could
go
back
to
a
separate
statutory
scheme.
this,
i
would
remind
you,
is
a
constitutional
provision,
a
constitutional
provision
granting
an
affirmative
right
to
bail
in
all
cases,
but
withholding
that
grant
of
the
right
to
bail
in
some
cases.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
i
would
be
of
the
opinion
that
the
same
statutory
scheme
dealing
with
bail
generally
would
be
applicable
to
bail
pending
appeal.
the
same
criteria
would
remain
applicable.
it
is
not
a
separate
section
of
our
law.
the
kinds
of
considerations,
if
there
were
bail
application
made
at
the
time
of
appeal,
would
be
equally
applicable
to
those...
to
applications
made
prior
to
conviction.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor.
that
statutory
scheme
only
deals
with
the
amount
of
bail
and
the
manner
in
which
bail
would
be
imposed.
for
instance,
the
judge
is
free
to--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--apparently
we
are
not
understanding
each
other,
your
honor--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--because
that
is
not
the
case.
if
bail
is
to
be
denied
mr.
hunt
or
anyone
else,
it
must
be
done
pursuant
to
this
constitutional
provision.
period.
there
are
no
other
provisions
of
law
which
would
permit
the
denial
of
bail
in
any
case,
except--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
there
has
to
be
some
scheme
there
on
the
judge's
discretion
to
not
release...
we
are
still
not
communicating.
when
we
get
beyond
the
conviction
stage,
then
the
statutory
provision
would
permit
the
declination
of
appeal
pending...
bail
pending
appeal.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
the
portion
of
that
statute
would
deal
only
with
persons
who
have
been
convicted.
it
is
one
statute
dealing
with
the
question
of
bail.
one
portion
of
it
deals
with
what
criteria
to
be
determined
when
we
are
determining
the
amount
of
bail.
another
section
of
it
deals
with
after
conviction,
what
criteria
might
be
considered
when
determining
whether
bail
should
be
granted
while
on
appeal
once
it
has
been
denied
or
not
met.
in
many
instances,
it
is
a
question
of
bail
reduction
applications.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
and
or
the
constitutional
provision
that
is
before
you
today.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor,
not
on
a
bank
robbery
charge.
we
are
talking
about
prior
to
conviction?
is
that
correct?
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
prior
to
conviction?
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
he
might
not
deny
bail
on
a
bank
robbery
charge.
he
might
set
bail
at
$1
million,
if
he
concluded
that
he
was
a
dangerous
individual
or
that
he
was
likely
not
to
return.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
he
can,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
because
there
is
no...
article
i,
section
9,
says
all
persons
shall
be
bailable
except
murder,
treason,
first
degree
sexual
assault.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
only
withdrawal
of
the
right
to
demand
bail.
once
a
person
is
entitled
to
the
right
to
demand
bail,
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
to
determine
what
kind,
if
any,
bail
is
to
be
required.
once
there
is
a
conviction,
then
there
is
the
ultimate...
the
other
consideration.
now
we
are
not
talking
about
a
person
accused,
we
are
talking
about
a
convicted
individual.
his
rights
to
liberties,
et
cetera,
are
entirely
different.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
there
is
no...
other
than
this
constitutional
provision,
there
is
no
prohibition
in
our
constitution
or
our
statutes
to
the
denial
of
bail.
the
judge
would
be
free
to
do
that
which
he
wished.
our
constitution,
however,
takes
that
discretion
from
the
judge
and
gives
all
person
the
right
to
bail
except
a
select
group
charged
with
certain
crimes.
so
without
that
select
group
being
withheld,
a
trial
judge
would
have
no
power
to
withhold
bail
for
anyone.
he
would
have
the
power
to
set
it
extremely
high,
but
not
to
deny
or
refuse
to
set
it
in
any
event.
what
we
have
before
the
court
today
is
the
effort
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
nebraska
to
balance
the
rights
of
the
society
to
be
free
from
crime
and
the
fear
of
crime
against
an
individual's
right
to
liberty,
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
nebraska
suggest
that
the
people's
right
to
liberty...
that
this
means
of
doing
that
is
reasonable,
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
are
only
withholding
the
right
to
demand
trial
from
those
accused
of
heinous
crimes,
where
the
proof
of
their
guilt
is
evident,
and
the
presumption
of
their
guilt
is
great.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
what
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
i
cite
you
to
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
mccowan
in
parker
versus
roth.
parker
versus
roth
is
the
closest
case
that
we
have
on
that
point.
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it
is
found
at
202
nebraska
850.
if
you
will
read
chief
justice
krivosha's
remarks,
those
remarks
that
have
been
quoted
to
you
by
mr.
hornstein,
i
think
you
will
find,
first
of
all,
that
that
is
purely
dicta,
and
secondly,
if
you
actually
read
the
language
used,
i
don't
think
you
can
conclude
from
reading
that
that
he
is
establishing
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
then
when
you
read
justice
mccowan's
concurring
opinion,
i
think
he
makes
it
exceptionally
clear
that
this
is
not
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
mr.
hornstein
would
have
us
believe
that
this
non-capital
exception
has
been
historically
recognized,
that
in
being
that
there
has
always
been
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
bail.
we
suggest
that
as
early
as
the
petition
of
right
in
1628,
going
through
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1679
and
the
bill
of
rights
in
england
in
1689,
that
those
provisions
were
merely
enacted
to
guarantee
the
right
to
bail
where
it
otherwise
exists.
it
was
not
meant
to
create
a
fundamental
right
to
bail.
it
was
being
abused
in
england,
and
thereafter
provision
was
made
so
that
excessive
bail
could
not
be
required
where
it
was
otherwise
permitted.
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
our
federal
constitution,
this
particular
provision
was
well
known.
many
of
the
states
at
that
time,
at
the
enactment
of
the
eighth
amendment,
also
had
statutory
rights
to
bail.
the
inconsistency
could
not
have
been
missed
by
the
colonial
states
at
that
time.
the
federal
judiciary
act--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--your
honor,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
concept
that
that
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
that
says
excessive
bail
shall
not
be
required
is
applicable
to
the
states,
but
merely
the
literal
language
contained
therein,
excessive
bail
shall
not
be
required,
period,
comma,
on
with
the
clause.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
provision
as
being
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
if
in
fact
it
does,
however,
then
we
call
your
attention
to
the
numerous
states
that
have,
i
believe
there
are
43
in
number,
that
provide
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
right
to
bail
in
capital
offenses,
yet
there
is
no
individualized
determination
as
to
the
likelihood
of
their
return
in
many,
if
not
all
of
those
states.
if
in
fact
we
are
required
to
determine
the
likelihood
of
the
recommission
of
the
crime,
then
are
we
also
required
to
determine
the
likelihood
of
non-return?
one
point
that
should
be
brought
out
here
is
that
the
capital
differentiation
here,
the
idea
that
because
it
is
a
capital
offense
persons
are
not
likely
to
return,
in
the
state
of
nebraska
alone
no
one
has
been
executed
in
the
state
of
nebraska
since
1959.
the
idea
that
the
very
fact
that
it
is
a
capital
offense
does
not
serve
much
of
a
deterrent
or
provide
much
of
a
reason
for
fleeing
when
we
haven't
put
anyone
to
death
since
1959.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
i
believe
we
have
somewhere
between
10
and
12
on
death
row
at
this
time.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
my
comment
is
that
it
has
not
been
exercised.
the
most
significant
part
of
that
comment
is,
if
we
are
required
to
have
criteria
for
determining
dangerousness,
i
think
it
would
also
be
incumbent,
it
would
follow
necessarily
then
under
the
same
constitutional
provision,
we
are
still
talking
about
the
same
criteria,
to
have
criteria
for
determining
likelihood
of
return,
and
i
think
most
states'
constitutional
provisions
would
fail
if
subjected
to
that
analysis
if
in
fact
that
analysis
is
adopted
by
this
court.
once
again,
we
are
balancing
the
rights
of
society
under
the
fourteenth
or
any
other
federal
amendment
with
the
rights
of
individuals,
and
we
suggest
that
at
this
point
in
time
that
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude,
we
can
examine...
the
best
indicator
of
activity,
the
best
indicator
of
conduct
is
past
conduct,
and
in
closing,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
quote
from
the
remarks
that
you
made
in
the--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
no,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
well,
i
suspect
that
any
bail
to
certain
defendants
could
have
been
excessive
bail.
that
is--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--he
couldn't
have
denied
him
bail.
he
very
well
might
have
set
bail--
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
--effectively
denied
him
release.
mr.
terry
r.
schaaf
that
is
theoretically
possible,
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
closing,
your
honor,
last
year
in
your
state
of
the
judiciary
comment,
you
mentioned
that
states
which...
states
and
governments
exist
merely
to
protect
people,
and
while
it
may
be
admirable
to
attempt
to
do
whatever
we
can
to
protect
the
rights
of
accused,
states
fail
in
their
mission
if
they
don't
also
protect
the
people
of
their
states
from
the
fear
of
crime
and
from
crime
itself.
we
suggest
in
closing
that
nebraska
has
done
what
it
can.
