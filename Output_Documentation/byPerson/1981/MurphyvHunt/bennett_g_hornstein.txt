mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
eugene
hunt
was
held
without
bail
for
a
period
of
four
months
and
three
days
between
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
the
commencement
of
his
first
trial.
he
was
held
solely
because
he
was
charged
with
the
crime
of
forcible
first
degree
sexual
assault,
and
upon
a
finding
that
the
proof
was
evident
and
the
presumption
great
by
two
trial
judges.
we
have
a
survey
that
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
that
reflects
the
disposition
of
these
no
bail
cases
during
the
first
year
that
the
constitutional
amendment
was
in
effect.
it
reflects
that
there
were
32
defendants
held
without
bail
during
the
first
year
that
we
were
able
to
identify,
20
of
whose
cases
had
been
disposed
of.
two
of
these
defendants
were
acquitted
by
juries
after
having
spent
a
total
of
120
days
in
jail.
only
one
defendant
out
of
those
20
was
convicted
of
the
original
non-bailable
offense.
the
remainder
had
their
charges
dismissed,
or
they
pled
guilty
to
reduced
bailable
misdemeanors
or
felonies.
we
think
this
reflects
the
injustice
of
this
law,
the
unfairness
of
this
law,
the
over
inclusiveness
of
this
law.
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
we
think,
is
not
whether
the
state
of
nebraska
has
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
preventing
the
crime
of
rape,
which
we
concede
it
does,
but
whether
eugene
hunt
and
other
defendants
charged
with
rape
have
a
fundamental
right
or
otherwise
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
pretrial
liberty,
which
we
argue
that
they
do,
or
even
whether
preventive
detention
in
general
is
constitutionally
permissible,
which
we
believe
is
an
issue
that
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case,
because
nebraska
in
fact
has
not
provided
for
any
individual
determination
of
dangerousness
by
a
trial
judge.
it
is
simply
presumed
dangerousness
from
the
nature
of
the
charge,
and
the
weight
of
the
evidence
at
the
time
of
the
initial
charge.
the
central
issue
is
whether
the
means
chosen
by
the
state
to
promote
its
legitimate
interest.
the
means,
being
denial
of
pretrial
bail
to
all
defendants
merely
charged
with
rape
where
the
proof
is
evident
and
the
presumption
great,
is
substantially
related
to
the
effectuation
of
the
state's
legitimate
purpose.
in
other
words,
does
it
closely
fit,
is
it
tailored,
does
it
provide
for
rebuttal--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--there
is
no
statutory
procedure
that
is
completely
clear.
the--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--okay.
what
happened
here
is
typical
of
what
happens.
nebraska's
evidence
code,
which
was
enacted
a
few
years
ago,
provides
that
bail
hearings
or
summary
proceedings
to
which
the
rules
of
evidence
are
not
applicable,
the
proceeding
is
contained
in
about
five
pages
of
a
transcript
which
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
proceeding
that
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
was
an
appeal
from
the
initial
denial
of
bail
by
a
magistrate.
the
typical
proceeding
is
that
the
defendant
appears
with
his
counsel
and
the
prosecutor
before
a
magistrate
initially.
the
charge
is
read.
the
court
makes...
sometimes
the
prosecutor
will
say
a
few
words
about
the
nature
of
the
case.
the
defense
attorney
may
say
a
few
words
about
the
background
of
the
defendant.
the
court
summarily
fixes
bail.
according
to
the
statutory
scheme,
our
bail
reform
statutes,
which
were
enacted
in
the
early
seventies,
and
are
similar
to
the
federal
bail
reform
act,
the
defendant,
if
he
is
unable
to
make
the
fixed
bail
within
24
hours
after
it
is
initially
set
has
a
right
of
review
to
another
judge,
a
district
judge.
that
was
done
in
this
case,
and
that
hearing
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix.
at
that
time,
i
attempted...
i
told
the
court
that
the
defendant
had
roots
in
the
community.
at
that
time
we
told
the
court
that
he
had
a
minimal
criminal
history,
and
according
to
the
statute,
the
only
factor
to
be
considered
in
fixing
bail
is
the
risk
of
flight.
the
statute
says
nothing
about
dangerousness.
it
says
nothing
about
any
other
factors
to
be
considered
other
than
the
risk
of
non-appearance.
and
those
were
the
background
factors
that
i
attempted
to
provide
to
the
court.
the
court
ignored
those,
and
said,
according
to
the
constitutional
amendment
that
was
passed
in
1978
and
parker
versus
roth,
which
was
the
nebraska
supreme
court
case
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision,
bail
is
denied.
that
was
the
end
of
the
hearing.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that's
right.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
the
argument
that
we
make
is
that
that
is
a
meaningless
standard,
if
not
unconstitutionally
vague
under
the
rule
under
that
we,
you
know,
we
stipulated
to.
we
concede
that.
but
our
position
is
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
never
defined
that
standard.
that
is
not
a
recognized,
easily
defined
standard.
this
court
in
addington
v.
texas
defined
the
three
ordinary
burdens
of
proof.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
i
am
aware
of
that
rule,
your
honor,
but
our
position
is,
there
are
three
different
rules
in
this
country
as
to
what
that
standard
means,
one
of
which
is
that
the
charge
itself
constitutes
in
irrebuttable
presumption
of
proof
evident
and
presumption
great.
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
never
defined
that
standard.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
even
assuming...
well,
again,
i
think
the
court
still
has
the
dilemma
of
determining
what
does
it
mean.
i
mean,
if
it
means
that
it
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
proof
is
evident
and
presumption
great,
whatever
that
means--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--of
what
effect
was
the
stipulation?
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
there
were
several--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--there
were
several
reasons
for
stipulating,
your
honor.
we
did
feel
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
fairly
strong
case
against
the
defendant.
in
fact,
he
had
four
charges
against
him
where
the
likelihood
of
acquittal
on
all
charges
was
not
very
great.
we
were
fearful
of
a
federal
abstention
problem,
to
be
honest.
our
office
has
the
largest
criminal
defense
case
load
in
the
state.
we
have
the
largest
number
of
defendants
who
are
being
held
without
bail.
we
felt
these
cases
become
moot
very
quickly,
as
happened
in
the
parker
case,
which
became
moot
after
the
nebraska
supreme
court
ruled
on
it.
we
had
to
wait
for
another
defendant
to
come
along
to
raise
this
issue,
and
it
has
taken
three
years
to
get
it
to
this
court
since
we
started,
exactly
three
years
ago
this
month.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
the
nebraska
supreme
court
delayed
it
for
that
purpose,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
at
the
time,
the
evidence
that
we
had
available...
this
was
shortly
after
he
was
initially...
and
i
was
not
his
trial
lawyer,
i
only
function
in
an
appellate
capacity,
but
the
information
from
our
office
file
reflected
that
he
had
a
misdemeanor
record.
he
had
lived
in
omaha
for
more
than
ten
years,
and
that
was
the
extent
of
the
record
that
was
available.
we
have
since
learned
that
he
previously
had
a
statutory
rape
conviction
in
another
state
that
had
occurred
12
or
13
years
before
this.
but
that
information
was
not
given
to
him
by
us,
and
we
had
no
criminal
history
record
available
to
reflect
that.
we
think
that
that
is
really
irrelevant,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well...
okay.
our
position
is...
i
am
glad
you
raised
that
question,
because
that
leads
to
the
next
step.
even
assuming
that
it
means
high
probability--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--i
don't
think
any
state
has
defined
it
that
way.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
our
position
that
we
have
taken
in
the
brief
is
that
it
means...
if
it
means
high
probability
of
guilt...
let's
assume
it
means
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--proof
evident
presumption,
whatever
that--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--i
don't
know.
i
mean,
the
cases
that
have...
there
are
three
different
definitions
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
states,
and
to
my
knowledge
they
had
not
split
that
down
the
middle
and
tried
to
define
it
independently.
it
is
defined
together.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
it
has
taken
three
years.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
i
am
not
sure...
you
know,
our
experience--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--no,
to
my
knowledge
that
issue
has
never
been
decided
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
the
only
time
it
could
have
been
decided
before
would
be
in
a
murder
case
or
a
treason
case,
and
to
my
knowledge
we
have
never
had
a
treason
prosecution.
we've
got
a
relatively
small
state.
even
the
number
of
murder
prosecutions
is
relatively
small.
and
the
chance
of
a
bail
issue
ever--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--i
suppose
we
could
have
tried.
my
experience
in
these
cases
has
been
that
they
won't
listen.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
it
is
a
summary
hearing,
and
i
have
never
seen
anybody...
in
fact,
i
have
never
seen
witnesses
called
in
a
bail
hearing.
it
is
just
unheard
of.
it
just
doesn't
happen.
i
mean,
it
is
a
summary
proceeding.
you
walk
up
in
front
of
the
judge
and
you
say
a
few
words--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--absolutely...
where
the
constitutional
amendment--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--to
my
knowledge,
i
don't
know
the
exact
source.
i
know
that
it
appears
in
the
northwest
ordinance
of
1787.
it
appears
in
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
it
has
been
adopted.
practically
every
state
constitution
has
that
language
in
it.
and
we
have
got
a
summary
of
the
different
state
rules
in
the
brief,
and
there
are
three
different
rules,
one
of
which
is
that
you
can't
even
put
on
any
evidence
because
it
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
arising
out
of
the
charge
that
it
is.
another
is
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
is
not
evident
and
great.
and
the
third
is
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
state
to
show
some
high
probability
of
guilt.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
as
i
recall,
the
majority
rule
is
the
middle
one
that
i
mentioned,
the
one
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
defendant.
the
other
two
rules
are
minority.
i
don't
know
the
number
of
states.
now,
our
position
is
that
even
if
it
means
high
probability
of
guilt,
there
is
no
logical
or
empirical
data
to
support
the
presumption
by
the
state
that
all
or
even
a
significant
number
of
defendants
who
are
probably
guilty
of
rape
would
commit
rape
if
released
on
bail.
now,
that
is
the...
the
legislative
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
to
prevent
the
crime
of
rape
during
the
period
of
pretrial
release
on
bail.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
under
this
amendment,
there
is
no
need
to
inquire
into
that.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
it
is
assumed.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
under
this
amendment.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
i
think
it
is
irrelevant,
because
they
don't
need...
i
mean,
it
is
presumed.
they
have
to
deny
him
bail.
now,
that
is
another
issue.
i
don't
want
to
deviate
from
the
question
here,
but
our
position,
contrary
to
the
state's,
is
that
once
a
finding
is
made
of
a
charge
of
rape,
and
the
proof
evident
and
the
presumption
great,
there
is
no
discretion
to
deny
bail.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
yes,
and
i
quoted
it
at
footnote
18
on
page
37
of
my
brief.
chief
justice
krivosha,
who
wrote
the
parker
opinion
for
what
was
a
unanimous
court,
and
i
hesitate
to
quote,
but
i
will
quote
a
little
bit
here.
he
says,
"it
should
be
clearly
recognized
that
the
1978
bail
amendment
does
not
prohibit
bail
in
every
case
where
an
individual
is
charged
with
a
sexual
offense.
"
"in
order
for
one
so
charged
to
be
ineligible
for
bail,
it
must
appear.
"
et
cetera.
and
then
he
goes
on,
and
he
says,
"in
any
instance
in
which
the
court
is
not
convinced
that
either
the
proof
is
evident
or
the
presumption
great,
then
the
court
is
not
prohibited
from
granting
bail.
"
and
in
the
next
paragraph
he
says
that
we
are
therefore
left
with
the
question
whether
the
legislature
and
the
people
thereafter
acted
rationally
and
reasonably
in
concluding
that
where
the
proof
is
evident
or
presumption
great,
that
an
individual
had
committed
a
sexual
offense,
"such
person
should
not
be
free
on
bail
pending
trial.
"
we
think
that
commits
the
state
to
the
position
that
once
such
a
finding
is
made,
there
is
no
discretion,
and
our
survey,
we
think,
reflects
that,
and
the
bail
hearing
in
this
case
reflects
it.
there
was
no
inquiry
made
into
individual
factors
bearing
on
dangerousness.
it
is
a
presumption--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--that's
right.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
no,
our
position
is,
the
capital
crimes
exception
has
existed
since
prior,
even,
to
those
provisions
that
were
adopted
at
the
time
of
the
bill
of
rights,
well,
at
the
time
of
the
judiciary
act.
blackstone
is
quoted
in
the
circuit
court
opinion
below
in
1770
in
his
commentaries
on
the
laws
of
england,
stating
that
the
rationale
for
that
rule
was
that
a
defendant
facing
the
penalty
of
death
could
not
be
assumed
to...
or
he
would
not
appear
regardless
of
what
amount
of
bail
was
fixed,
because
the
penalty
itself
would
deter
his
appearance,
and
that
is
the
rationale
for
that
rule,
which
does
not
apply
to
non-capital
offenses.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
absolutely
not.
now,
there
is
some
language
in
a
law
review
article
that
john
mitchell
wrote
in
the
late
sixties
where
he
claims
that
that
was
one
of
the
purposes,
but
i
have
read
a
lot
of
literature
and
i
cannot
find
any
justification
for
that
language.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
we
are
assuming
here
only
for
purposes
of
argument
that
the...
in
other
words,
we
don't
think
it
is
necessary
to
decide
the
preventive
detention
issue
here,
because
this
law
is
so
overbroad
that
even
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
that
it
is
constitutional,
it
can't
stand.
we
don't
think
the
thin
facts
of
this
case
present
the
punishment
issue
that
you
discussed
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
and
that
that
would
be
more
appropriately
heard
in
a
case
like
united
states
v.
edwards,
which
is
pending
on
certiorari
from
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
it
is
unclear
in
nebraska.
my
recollection
of
the
bail
reform
statute
is
that
it
does
not
draw
any
distinction
between
pre
and
post-conviction
standards
for
fixing
bail.
the
only
permissible
consideration
is
risk
of
non-appearance,
and
i
don't
recall
that
there
is
any
distinction
between
pre
and
post-conviction.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
oh,
i
agree
with
that.
certainly.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
i
think
it
mandates
a
denial
of
bail.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
no,
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
moot.
i
mean,
i
think
both
sides
agree
that
it
is
not
moot.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
i
realize
that.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
i
mean,
under
the
nebraska
press
association
standard,
as
i
understand
it,
if
it
is
capable
of
repetition--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--okay,
if...
right.
i
mean,
he
can
be
denied
bail
as
long
as
the--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--that'
right.
that's
right.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that's
right.
my
recollection
of
the
statute
is
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
bail
if
you
overturn
this
law,
subject
to
the
flight
consideration.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
that
only
applies
if
it
is
one
of--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--yes,
that
only
applies
if
it
is
a
non-bailable
offense.
if
you
decide
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
make
rape
non-bailable,
then
he
automatically
becomes...
the
proof
evident,
presumption
great
is
an
irrelevant
factor,
because
it
has
to
go
together
with
the
charge
of
rape.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
no,
i
can't
say
that.
i
mean,
the
court...
i
think
the
court
could
find
that...
i
mean,
the
flight
risk,
i
think,
increases
following
conviction.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
nebraska
cases
that
say
that
that
is
a
factor
that
can
be
considered.
the
statute
totally--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--well,
i
don't
think
that
is
really
relevant
to
the
determination
of
this
case.
i
mean,
the
man
has
been
convicted
of
three
sexual
assaults,
and
one
weapons
use
charge,
and
he
has
got
long
sentences.
i
think
that
increases
the
flight
risk.
traditionally,
the
sole
purpose
or
one
of
the
few
purposes
of
bail
has
been
to
ensure
appearance.
i
think
that
risk
increases.
but,
you
know,
i
suppose
a
court
could
find
that
he
might
qualify.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
these
were
not
tried
together.
they
were
all...
there
were
three
separate
trials.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
oh.
under
the
amendment,
i
think
it
would
be
irrelevant,
if
i
understand
the
question.
i
mean,
if
he
has
got
any
charge
of
forcible
first
degree
sexual
assault,
the
proof
is
evident,
and
presumption
great,
our
position
is,
bail
has
to
be
denied,
if
there
were
a
conviction.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that's
right.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
my
understanding
is
that
they
cannot
deny
bail.
they
have
to
fix
bail.
now,
i
know
what
would
happen.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
yes.
that
is
the
standard--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--well,
that
is
an
issue
that
has
yet
to
be
decided,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
that
would
present
a
pure
excessive
bail.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
what?
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
right.
but
we
know
that
that
is
the
standard
practice.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
we
don't
do
it.
the
judges
do
it.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
yes.
our
position
is
that
that
has
got
deep
historical
roots.
it
has
got
a
rationale
that
is
reasonable,
and
there
is
another
exception
for,
you
know,
defendants
who
threaten
witnesses,
juries.
that
is
another
traditional
exception.
other
than
those
two--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--well,
the
difference
is
that
that...
the
rationale
for
that
is
the
threat
of
capital
punishment
causing
a
flight
risk
which
doesn't
exist
in
a
non-capital
crime.
this
crime
in
this
case,
the
charges
carry
penalties
of
one
to
50
years,
and
the
weapons
charge,
i
think,
was
a
consecutive
one,
20.
but
we
have
a
number
of
other
crimes
in
nebraska
that
carry
equal
or
higher
penalties,
yet
they
are
all
bailable.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that's
right.
our
position
is
that
that
rationale
does
not
apply
except
in
the
case
of
a
capital
crime.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
yes.
now,
we
haven't
really
touched
on
that
issue.
we
spend
half
our
brief
discussing
that,
because
that
determines
the
standard
of
review
to
be
applied.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
bail
under
the
standards
that
were
set
down
in
duncan
v.
louisiana
in
justice
white's
opinion,
which
sets
out
the
test
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
a
criminal
bill
of
rights
protection
is
applicable
to
the
states,
is
equally
applicable
in
this
case
here.
the
essential
test
was
whether
the
right
that
is
being
considered
as
fundamental
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
process
is
maintained
by
the
american
states,
and
the
court
has
applied
a
number
of
criteria
to
determine
that.
the
state
argues
here
that
the
excessive
bail
clause
should
not
apply,
and
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
right
to
bail
guaranteed
against
legislative
abuse,
because
it
doesn't
say
that.
well,
we
cite
a
number
of
the
decisions
which
have
found
rights
to
be
fundamental
and
applicable
to
the
states
which
aren't
even
mentioned
in
the
bill
of
rights,
such
as
travel,
appropriation,
voting,
privacy,
association,
and
in
the
criminal
area,
the
presumption
of
innocence,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
none
of
those
are
mentioned
in
the
bill
of
rights,
and
yet
they
have
been
found
applicable
to
the
states.
one
of
the
most
recent
rights
in
the
richmond
newspaper,
the
virginia
case
that
was
written
by
chief
justice
burger,
holding
that
the
right
of...
that
there
was
a
fundamental
right
to
public
access
to
criminal
trials
that
was
implicit
in
the
first
amendment.
our
position
is
that
if
a
right
to
bail
guaranteed
against
legislative
abuse
is
not
found
to
be
implicit
in
the
eighth
amendment,
then
it
becomes
meaningless,
because
if
the
legislature
can
take
away
a
right
that
the
cause
says
bail
cannot
be
excessive,
and
yet
if
it
can
be
denied
by
a
legislature,
that
right
becomes
eviscerated.
if
the
legislatures
are
left
free
to
render
any
crime
non-bailable,
they
can...
theoretically
they
can
choose
misdemeanors
like
petty
larceny
drunk
driving;
any
other
charge
could
be
rendered
non-bailable,
which
would
totally
eviscerate
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
bail
clause.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
i...
yes,
we...
in
fact,
i
discussed
it
from
sort
of
an
intermediate
scrutiny
analysis,
assuming
that
the
court
finds
that
bail
is
not
a
fundamental
right.
now,
we
strongly
urge
that
bail
is
a
fundamental
right,
a
right
to
bail
guaranteed
against
unreasonable
legislative
denial
under
the
eighth
amendment
is
an
implicit,
fundamental
right
that
is
applicable
to
the
states.
however,
if
the
court
finds
that
it
is
not,
you
can
still
apply
a
due
process
or
equal
protection
intermediate
scrutiny
analysis.
in
fact,
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
even
under
a
rational
basis
minimal
scrutiny
argument,
you
might
be
able
to
invalidate
this
on
the
ground
that
the
legislature
has
offered
absolutely
no
data
to
support
its
position
that
all
or
most
people
charged
with
rape
will
commit
rape
if
released
on
bail.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
our
preferred
position
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
itself
can
be
used
to
invalidate
this,
but--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--the
language
in
carlson
v.
landon...
well,
the
circuit
below
distinguished
that
case
on
the
ground
that
that
involved
an
administrative
denial
of
bail
by
the
attorney
general
to
alien
communists
facing
deportation.
it
was
not
a
criminal
context.
the
excessive
bail
clause
appears
in
the
context
of
an
amendment
that--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--that's
right.
our
position--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--well,
our
position
is
that
it
is
dictum.
it
relied
upon
the--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--a
holding,
and
the
case
was--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--the
language
in
the
opinion
says
that
they
were
limiting
the
holding
of
the
circumstances
of
that
particular
case.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that's
right,
in
a
non-criminal--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--in
a
non-criminal
context.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
well,
we
think
that
is
an
important
distinction.
the
court
there...
there
were
four
vigorous
dissents
in
that
case.
the
court
relied
on--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--burton
and
black.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
that
may
be
right.
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
i
would
assume
that
a
stricter
standard
would...
well,
traditionally.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
in
a
criminal
context
the
individual
rights
would
be
subject
to
more
protection
than
they
would
be
in
an
administrative,
civil
situation.
if
i
understand...
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but--
mr.
bennett
g.
hornstein
--i
would
think
so.
i
mean,
i
would
think
the
standards
that
protect
the
individual
rights
in
a
civil
situation
would
be
lower
than
those
in
the
criminal
situation,
especially
here
where
the
eighth
amendment
was
directed
at
criminal
cases.
