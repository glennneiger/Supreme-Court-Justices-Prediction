unknown
speaker
had
there
been
any
advance...
had
there
been
any
advance
indication
from
the
judge
directing
all
counsel
not
to
have
any
public
statements?
unknown
speaker
he
was
not
himself
of
counsel,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
ms.
burgess,
i
wonder
if
you'd
try
to
speak
just
a
little
louder,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
ms.
burgess,
in
that
connection
may
i
ask,
is
it
still
the
practice
to
have
the
record
made
by
the
local
committee
but
the
actual
decision
to
be
made
on
that
record
only
by
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
they
reviewable
by
the
supreme
court
now?
unknown
speaker
i'm
away
from
this
a
long
time,
but--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
and
that
goes
to
this--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
goes
to
the
supreme
court
then.
unknown
speaker
and
then
is
there
still
oral
argument
before
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
in
open
court?
unknown
speaker
and
every
issue
that...
legal
or
otherwise
that's
raised--
unknown
speaker
--may
then
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
had
been
made.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
when
the
supreme
court
does
this
and
decides
finally
a
case,
does
it
still
publish
opinions?
unknown
speaker
by
name
of
attorney
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
but
would
be
it
be
fair...
is
it...
would
we
be
fair
in
understanding
that
only
what
might
be
called
serious
cases
get
that
far?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
in
this
case
the
supreme
court
certified
to
itself
the
whole
proceeding,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
does
that
suggest
that
the
supreme
court's
considering
this
as
a
major
disciplinary
matter?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
it...
everyone
else
is
now
out
of
this
proceeding
except
the
supreme
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i
mean
as
far
as
new
jersey.
unknown
speaker
as
new
jersey
is
concerned.
only
the
supreme
court
has
cognizance
of
this
case
now.
unknown
speaker
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
there
has
been
no
decision
in
the
supreme
court
as
yet.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
burgess,
what
exactly
is
the
question
before
us?
is
it
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
as
of
the
factual
situation
before
the
district
court
at
the
time
it
acted,
or
whether
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
in
the
factual
context
of
what
we
now
know
about
the
situation,
because
there
has
been
a
factual
change.
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
third
circuit
is
not
interfering
with
the
ongoing
consideration
by
the
new
jersey
court
now?
unknown
speaker
i
am
puzzled
about
that.
how
would
affect
what
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
might
do?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
ms.
burgess,
excuse
me.
would
you
stay
close
to
those
microphones?
we're
having
difficulty
hearing
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
if
this
suit
had
not...
federal
action
had
not
been
filed,
as
i
understand
you,
only
major
matters
get
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
a
major
matter
within
the
meaning
of
that
test
or
not.
is
there
a
strong
likelihood
that
had
the
federal
suit
not
been
filed,
this
case
never
would
have
reached
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
one
thing
that
puzzled
me,
as
to
one
of
the
rules...
i
can't
remember...
one
of
the
rules
i
thought
only
applied
to
counsel
of
record
in
a
case.
and
conceivably
at
the
preliminary
stage
it
might
have
just
found
no
merit
to
the
charge
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
position
does
your
client
take
on
that
issue?
does
associated
with
the
defense
include
people
who
are
not
participants
in
the
litigation?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
isn't
that
a
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
don't
you
have
a
position
on
the
issue
that
you're
maintaining
in
that
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
it
does
specifically
extend
to
this
particular
person.
unknown
speaker
ms.
burgess,
i
misunderstood
you.
didn't
you
start
off
by
saying
the
merits
weren't
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
the
merits,
and
you're
now
answering
them.
well,
i
asked
the
question.
unknown
speaker
it's
my
fault.
let
me
just--
--well,
what
would
happen
if
the
supreme
court
this
afternoon
decides
that
this
case
is
without
merit
and
dismisses
it?
unknown
speaker
could
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
could
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
what
would
that
do
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
it
at
all.
well,
why
isn't
the
case
over
if
that
happens?
i
don't
see...
the
case
is
over,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
this
case
and
all
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever...
my
brother
marshall's
question
was
if
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
having
addressed
the
merits,
dismisses
the
charge
against
mr.
hinds,
isn't
that
the
end
of
this
whole
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
that
case
be
mooted?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
case
be
mooted
if
they
dismissed
all
the
proceedings
that
underlie
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
might
vacate
the
opinion,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
continuance
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
nature
of
this
proceeding.
in
this
court,
as
you
know,
both
in
original
cases
and
in
others
we
have
inherent
and
constitutional
authority
to
appoint
a
special
master
to
undertake
some
inquiry.
now,
is
the
proceeding
in
new
jersey
roughly
comparable
to
that,
that
the
court
has
delegated
to
this
body
the
function
of
an
inquiring
master
or
a
special
master
to
develop
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
a
judicial
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
it
used
to
be,
ms.
burgess,
that
in
some
cases
rather
than
have
local
committees
do
the
fact-finding
job
the
superior
court
judges
used
to
do
it...
i
used
to
do
it...
at
the
direction
of
the
supreme
court.
is
that
still
so?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
describe
it
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
hasn't
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
authorized
this
body
to
do
what
it
was
doing?
unknown
speaker
it
delegated--
unknown
speaker
--delegated
to
them
a
fact-finding
function.
unknown
speaker
prosecuted
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
prosecuted
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stavis,
you
agree,
i
think,
that
the
thing
is
factually
somewhat
different
now
than
it
was
when
it
was
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
do
you
think
that
the
factual
differences
are
irrelevant
for
legal
purposes?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
an
equitable
action,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
this
an
equitable
action?
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
equity
as
of
the
time
of
judgment,
in
contrast
to
law
as
the
time
the
case
is
filed?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
long
way
back
to
understanding?
i
know
laws
change
a
lot,
but
wasn't
that
the
way
it
always
used
to
be,
that
equity
speaks
as
of
the
time
of
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
there
won't
be
anything
for
the
district
court
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
the
factual
developments...
putting
aside
the
younger
abstention
and
the
pullman
abstention
to
which
you
refer...
be
used
to
at
least
give
us
some
insight
into
the
nature
of
the
new
jersey
proceeding
that
we
might
not
have
had
if
it
had
just
been
pending
before
the
ethics
committee?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
stavis,
suppose
it
did
before
we
get
around
to
deciding
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happens?
suppose
they
evaluate
all
of
your
constitutional
questions
and
they
agree
or
disagree,
as
the
case
may
be,
and
they
enter
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
if
the
judgment's
adverse
to
your
client,
i
take
it
you
have
review
here,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
you
do
have...
that's
where
you
go,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
had
done
and
whether
or
not
we
granted
cert?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
we
granted
cert?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you'd
have
everything
that
your
client
seeks.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
other
"if"?
if
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
says
we
dismiss
this
complaint
for
every
one
of
the
reasons
that
you
asked
for,
then
what
action
would
you
have?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
and
we
could,
too,
couldn't
we?
might
be,
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--might
be,
you
say,
mr.
stavis?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
might
be
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
said
forget
everything
that's
happened
since
the
complaint
was
filed.
decide
the
case
on
the
facts
that
exist
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
that's
what
the
court
said.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
people
presented...
attempted
to
present
facts
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
had
occurred
since
the
district
court
decided,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
no,
we
will
not
take
cognizance
of
those
facts.
we
shall
decide
the
case
based
on
the
facts
that
existed
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
there
was...
even
if
there
had...
suppose
there
had
been,
though,
that
the
court
of
appeals
said...
you
do
agree
they
said
even
if
there
had
been
new
facts,
we
won't
take
cognizance
of
them.
they
at
least
said
they.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
they
were
wrong
on
their
rule,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
if
they
were
wrong
on
saying
they
shouldn't
take
cognizance
of
new
facts,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
there
weren't
any
new
facts.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
something,
please?
suppose
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
district
court...
suppose
when
the
case
was
filed
in
the
district
court
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
had
already
taken
to
its
bosom
the
constitutional
issues
that
had
been...
that
were
being
presented,
and
so
there
was
a
case
pending
in
the
supreme
court
with
the
very
constitutional
issues
in
it
that
were
being
presented
to
the
district
court.
i
suppose
you
would
say
this
would
still
not
be
a
younger
abstention
case.
it
is
just
a
civil
case
that...
to
which
younger
doesn't
apply,
or
would
you
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
certainly
is
pending
there
now
a
case
with--
unknown
speaker
--so
what...
how
should
we
view
the
case
then?
unknown
speaker
as
though
the
district
court...
as
the
district
court
should
have
viewed
it
if
the
case
had
been
pending
when
the
case
was
filed
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we're
just
being
asked
to
vacate
it?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
reverse
it.
we
just
say
you
might
have
been
right,
but
there
are
sole
things
that
have
happened
since
then
that
make
your
decision
improvident.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
wouldn't
say
it
was
erroneous.
we'd
just
say
it's
no
longer
appropriate
to
review
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
thought
it
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
thought
it
was
wrong?
do
you
think
we
ought
to
go
ahead
and
say
so,
or
wouldn't
you
rather
we
just
vacated
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
certainly
under
cases
like
will
v.
calvert
fire
insurance
company
where
you've
got
one
of
several
party
plaintiffs
litigating
in
a
state
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction
under
broad
comity
principles.
say
if
one
party
is
barred,
the
others
can
certainly
wait
until
we
find
out
what
the
state
court
is
going
to
decide.
unknown
speaker
well,
you'd
have
to
show
separate
standing
in
that
case,
though.
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis
the
abstention
doctrine
could
be
completely
nullified
by
having
independent
organizations
come
into
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stavis,
regarding
that,
does
everybody
agree
here
that
the
posture
of
the
case
is
what
the
third
circuit
said
it
was,
that
the
ethics
committee
accepted
the
recommendation
and
voted
to
prepare
a
formal
statement
of
charges
against
hinds
which
was
served
on
january
3,
1978?
unknown
speaker
which
really
corresponds
to
an
indictment,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
different?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
other
than
this
is
an
administrative
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
served
on
the
respondent
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
neither
is
state...
neither
is
state
jurisdiction
over
its
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
will
you
keep
your
voice
up?
we're
having
difficulty--
unknown
speaker
--you
can
stay
right
in
the
center.
just
keep
your
voice
up.
unknown
speaker
ms.
burgess,
what's
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
whatever
may
be
true
of
the
hinds
case,
that
doesn't
affect
the
standing
of
the
three
organizations?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
the
claims
of
these
three
organizations,
constitutional
or
otherwise,
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
they
aren't
parties,
are
the
issues...
the
issues
are
the
same.
unknown
speaker
precisely
the
same
issues.
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
it's
in
the
prosecutorial
stage,
if
a
constitutional
issue
is
raised
at
this
stage,
whatever
it
is,
that
happens
at
the
same
time
to
be
pending
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
that
does
pose
a
younger
question.
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
the
stage
of
the
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
because
there's
nothing
tentative...
there's
nothing
tentative
about
what's
going
on
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
but
on
page
10
of
your
brief
you
say
specifically
that
it
was
"to
bring
the
constitutional
claim
of
lennox
hinds,
esq.
"
"directly
before
the
supreme
court.
"
"it
doesn't
say
anything
about--
"
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
gathered
from
this--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
two--
unknown
speaker
--the
other
organization...
the
organizations
are
not
included.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
could,
too,
make
a
motion
to
participate.
may
i
ask
another
question
about
your
procedure?
would
it
be
consistent
with
new
jersey's
procedures
just
as
a
possible
disposition
of
the
case
pending
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
for
that
court
to
say,
number
one,
there's
no
merit
to
the
charges
against
mr.
hinds
for
whatever
reason
might
be;
number
two,
even
though
there's
no
controversy
remaining,
we
will
now
give
an
advisory
opinion
that
we
think
our
rule
is
a
perfectly
valid
constitutional
rule?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
possible.
unknown
speaker
and
then
nobody
could
review
that
determination
up
here.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
