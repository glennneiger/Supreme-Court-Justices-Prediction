mr.
morton
stavis
no,
sir,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
morton
stavis
any
more
than
consumers
union
against
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes.
it
adopted--
mr.
morton
stavis
--rules
which
authorize
this
body
to
do
what
it
was
doing,
but--
mr.
morton
stavis
--it
delegated
to
them...
not
quite
that,
your
honor.
at
the
stage
where
this
litigation
was
commenced
we
were
not
at
the
fact-finding,
period.
at
the
stage
where
the
federal
litigation
was
commenced
they
were
at
the
pre-prosecutive
portion
of
their
responsibilities.
in
other
words,
what
was
to
happen
as
of
the
time
that
this
federal
court
proceeding
was
commenced
was
that
a
hearing
was
to
be
held
not
for
the
purpose
of
finding
facts
for
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
but
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
mr.
hinds
was
to
be
prosecuted.
and
we
laid
that
out
quite
clearly--
mr.
morton
stavis
--as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
morton
stavis
prosecuted
by
the
district
ethics
committee,
and
he
would
be
prosecuted
by
the
district
ethics
committee
before
the
disciplinary
review
board.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
mechanism
in
our
structure
whereby
at
this
particular
stage
the
body
holds
hearings.
at
the
conclusion
of
those
hearings
they
don't
adjudicate
nor
do
they
even
present
it
to
the
supreme
court.
they
merely
decide
whether
to
present
the
matter
to
the
disciplinary
review
board.
and
so
that's
precisely
why
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
said
that
at
this
particular
juncture
the
district
ethics
committee
was
functioning
purely
in
the
prosecutive
level.
may
i
point
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
when
you
asked
the
question
with
respect
to
a
master,
when
a
master
is
appointed,
the
court
appointing
the
master
has
made
a
judicial
determination
that
the
issue
that
is
presented
requires
fact-finding;
and
there
has
been
some
preliminary
judicial
determination
as
to
the
legal
questions,
as
to
the
constitutional
questions.
here,
nothing
happened
other
than
david
foley
said
i'd
like
to
investigate,
and
the
committee
said
you
can
investigate.
nothing
further
happened
other
than
that,
and
we're
in
the
process
at
this
particular
point
where
we
go
into
court
where
the
consequence
of
them
going
ahead
is
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
prosecution.
now,
that's
not
the
point
at
which
abstention
applies.
that's
not
the
point
at
which
younger
abstention
applies.
in
fact,
so
far
as
i
know,
there's
case
after
case
after
case
in
this
court
which
says
that
prosecutors...
i'm
thinking
of
consumers
union...
prosecutors
are
natural
objects
of
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
and
the
younger
abstention
doesn't
apply.
i'm
thinking
of
steffel
against
thompson,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
i'm
thinking
of
the
doran
case,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
down
the
line,
before
there
has
been
a
prosecutive
determination,
before
the
matter
has
been
put
in
the
hands
of
a
body
which
has
the
power
to
make
a
judicial
determination
and
which
has
the
power,
more
particularly,
which
has
the
power
to
adjudicate
the
federal
constitutional
claims.
and
that's
the
essence
of
the
gibson
against
berryhill
standard.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
think
that
those
factual...
and
i
appreciate
the
sharpness
with
which
you
made
the
point
during
the
argument
of
my
adversary
that
there
really
are
two
distinct
issues
here.
one
was
the
issue
as
presented
to
the
district
court
and
adjudicated
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
consistent
with
its
prior
decision
and
consistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
lockport,
that
issues
of
abstention
are
determined
as
of
the
time
that
the
federal
court
action
is
commenced.
federal
court
jurisdiction
once
having
properly
attached,
the
subsequent
bringing
of
a
state
court
action,
which
may
conceivably
provide
the
possibility
of
satisfying
the
gibson
against
berryhill
standard...
and
that
was
lockport...
that
doesn't
alter
the
situation.
that
was
the
situation
at
the
district
court
level.
that
was
the
situation
at
the
level
of
the
court
of
appeals
before
the
third
circuit.
that
was
the
question
on
which
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
court.
those
were
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
morton
stavis
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
of
course.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
believe
that--
mr.
morton
stavis
--well,
in
the
abstention
area,
in
the
abstention
area,
and
in
the
equity
area
i'd
like
to
say
this,
too...
in
the
abstention
area
you've
settled
it.
in
the
abstention
area
you've
settled
that
the
subsequent
change
as
to
the
availability
of
a
state
court
forum
doesn't
alter
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
i
might
say,
if
the
court
will
allow,
in
the
equity
area,
too,
the
fact
that
after
equity
court
jurisdiction
has
attached
and
the
remedy
at
law
appears
to
be
adequate...
there's
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
cardoza
that
deals
exactly
with
that
question...
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
isn't
vacated.
now,
there
is...
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
there
is
a
question
with
respect
to
subsequently
developed
facts;
but
my
suggestion
with
respect
to
that
is
that
doesn't
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
that
may
go
to
a
wholly
different
kind
of
question.
you've
got
a
case...
and
this
sort
of
thing
occurs
quite
often...
you
have
a
pullman
abstention.
the
case
is
begun
in
the
united
states
district
court.
the
united
states
district
court
decides
to
send
it
out
into
the
state
court
for
adjudication
of
state
issues,
and
then
it
comes
back
to
the
district
court.
england
against
louisiana
medical
examiners.
while
it's
in
the
state
court
the
state
court
determines
not
only
state
issues
but
federal
constitutional
issues.
it
comes
back
to
the
district
court.
what's
the
consequence
of
those
facts
on
its
subsequent
handling
in
the
district
court?
now,
when
this
matter
was
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
we
put
into
our
brief
the
express
kind
of
reservation
which
this
court
referred
to
in
england
against
louisiana
board
of
medical
examiners.
we
said
we're
here
before
the
state
court
because
we've
been
ordered
to
be
here,
but
we
had
made
an
original
choice
of
forum
in
the
federal
court
and
want
to
make
sure
that
we
preserve
that.
when
this
court
gets
back
to
the
district
court...
when
this
case
comes
back
to
the
district
court,
the
consideration...
the
court
may
very
well
give
consideration
to
whether
those
facts
which
subsequently
develop
may
alter
the
status
of
the
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
there
will
be
nothing
for
the
district
court
to
do.
but
if
the
court
is
affirmed,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed
on
the
grounds
that...
on
the
only
grounds
that
they
passed
upon.
the
only
grounds
that
they
passed
upon
was
whether
or
not
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
as
of
the
time
the
action
was
commenced.
and
on
a--
mr.
morton
stavis
--yes,
you
can
certainly
have
insight
into
the
new
jersey
proceeding,
but
let
me
suggest,
justice
rehnquist,
as
to
why
it
is
that
you
can't
really
adjudicate
based
upon
that
for
the
following
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
of
this
time
you
haven't
the
faintest
idea
what
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
may
do.
you
don't
know
whether
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
is
going
to
adjudicate
this
simply
upon
some
of
the
grounds--
mr.
morton
stavis
--well,
you'd
have
to
look
at
what
they
did.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
sir.
mr.
morton
stavis
we
have
discretionary
review
here.
mr.
morton
stavis
no.
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
we'd
be
back
in
the
district
court.
mr.
morton
stavis
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
doubt
that
i
would
be
doing
two
things
at
the
same
time.
i
doubt
that
i
would
be
presenting
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
and
at
the
same
time
litigating
in
the
united
states
district
court.
i
think
that
would
be
a
foolhardy
undertaking
on
our
part.
but
certainly
if
this
court
should
reach
out
and
grant
cert,
obviously
the
constitutional
issues
would
be
decided
here.
but
otherwise,
as
soon
as--
mr.
morton
stavis
--if
you...
if
you
granted
cert,
of
course,
but
that's
quite
an
"if".
you
might
very
well
decide
that
you--
mr.
morton
stavis
--i
think
i'd
relax
at
that
point.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
that
might
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
everybody
could
relax
at
that--
mr.
morton
stavis
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
if
we
won
hands
down
on
all
the
issues.
but
let
me
point
out--
mr.
morton
stavis
--well,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
the
facts
that
are
being
asserted
here,
these
new
facts,
are
following
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
morton
stavis
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
never
had--
mr.
morton
stavis
--forgive
me,
but
i
beg
to
differ.
there
was
not
a
presentation
of
new
facts
before
the
court
of
appeals.
quite
the
contrary.
all
that
happened--
mr.
morton
stavis
--yes.
following,
following
your
own
decision
in
lockport.
and
that's
a
position
that
you
stated
in
lockport.
but
let
me
state
what
actually
happened
before
the
court
of
appeals.
there
were
no
new
facts.
there
was
an
offer.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
weren't
any
new
facts,
your
honor.
there
was
an
offer
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
saying
we
would
like,
if
we're
permitted
to,
we
would
like
to
consider
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
responded
positively
to
that
and
said
fine,
you
want
to
consider
the
constitutional
issues
now,
do
so.
i
think
they
were
responding
to
the
kind
of
comment
that
recently
i
read
in
the
chief
justice's
dissenting
opinion
in
wisconsin
against
constantino.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
responded
to
that
and
said
if
you
want
to
consider
these
issues,
do
so,
but,
but
since
that
would
change
the
circumstances
from
the
state
of
facts
when
these
folks
went
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
established
their
jurisdictional
foundation,
we're
not
prepared
to
say
that
if
you
do
so
that
will
defeat
jurisdiction
which
once
properly
attached.
now...
and
that's
the
most
consistent
application
of
settlor
that
i
know
of.
now,
that's
not
to
say,
that's
not
to
say
that
when
the
case
comes
back
we
don't
have
a
consideration
of
new
facts,
and
that's
england
against
louisiana
medical
board.
and
whether
or
not
whatever
the
supreme
court
did
should
subsequently
determine
what
happens,
there
will
be
certainly
time
to
consider
this.
but
this
court
can't
consider
that
question,
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
one
other
consideration
which
hasn't
been
mentioned
as
yet
which
i
think
is
quite
important.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
in
the
district
court
were
not
only
lennox
hinds
but
the
three
organizations
of
black
lawyers.
these
three
organizations
of
black
lawyers
said
we
very
seriously
are
concerned
with
these
disciplinary
rules
on
their
face
and
as
being
applied
because
we're
in
the
business
of
educating
people
in
new
jersey
and
elsewhere
as
to
what
we
consider
to
be
racist
practices
in
the
courts,
and
we
want
the
freedom
to
address
ourselves
in
that
respect.
now,
whatever
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
may
do
with
respect
to
lennox
hinds,
that
doesn't
affect
the
standing
of
these
bar
associations
to
object
to
these
rules
on
their
face
and
as
applied.
now,
if,
to
pick
up
mr.
justice
marshall's
comment,
that
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
should
decide
down
the
line
these
rules
are
completely
invalid
and
unconstitutional,
we're
going
to
appoint
a
committee
to
write
some
new
rules
and
consider
them
by
the
bar,
well,
i
guess
there
would
be
nothing
left
on
their
part
either
and
the
case
would
be
over
with.
mr.
morton
stavis
i'm
not
at
all
so
sure
i
would
take
the
position
that
you
suggest,
if
before
we
had
filed
our
action
in
the
district
court
there
was
a
case
pending
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
which
we
were
a
party
and
which
we
had
a
right
to
litigate.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
pending
as
to
lennox
hinds.
there
is
not
pending
as
to
the
three
organizations
of
black
lawyers.
and
there
isn't
any
doubt,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
the
factual
situation
has
changed
in
that
respect
following
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
third
circuit.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
you
should
view
this
case
now--
mr.
morton
stavis
--well,
of
course,
one
of
the
things
that
i
suggested
some
time
ago
before,
beforehand
was
that
the
petition
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted--
mr.
morton
stavis
--for
precisely
some
of
these
reasons.
but
not
doing
that,
i
think
that
you
should
view
it
in
the
following
terms:
that
you
are
asked
to
reverse
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
establishing
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
as
of
the
time
the
action
was
commenced.
mr.
morton
stavis
you're
being
asked
to--
mr.
morton
stavis
--and
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
if
you
consider
that
question
that
you
ought
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
whatever
happened
subsequently
does
not
make
improvident
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
when
it
was
rendered.
mr.
morton
stavis
but
you
asked
me
what
i
would
propose.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
what
i
would
propose
is
something
quite
different,
namely
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
be
affirmed
because
it
was
correct,
and
it
sustains
and
supports
and
applies
this
court's
decision
in
lockport.
now,
there's
nothing
to
say--
mr.
morton
stavis
--what's
that?
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
no.
i
can't
believe
that
you
would
think
that
the
decision
was
wrong
in
the
light
of
lockport.
i
mean
all
i
can
do
is
apply
the
law,
ask
you
to
apply
the
law
as
we
know
it
to
exist.
i
do
not
think
that
there
need
be
any
question
but
that
in
connection
with
further
proceedings
on
this
case,
if
there
are
to
be
any,
before
the
district
court
that
the
district
court,
and
in
due
course
the
court
of
appeals,
would
consider
the
impact,
if
any,
of
the
subsequent
determinations.
let
me
point
out
something
to
you.
some
years
ago
you
decided
the
case
called
american
trial
lawyers
association
against
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
and
of
course
all
new
jersey
lawyers
are
very
familiar
with
that
case
because
it
had
something
to
do
with
something
very
dear
to
their
hearts,
namely
the
fees
that
they
were
authorized
to
charge.
and
you
insisted
in
that
case
in
reversing,
reversing
a
district
court
decision
which
dismissed
jurisdiction;
it
dismissed
jurisdiction
in
a
pullman
abstention
case.
you
remanded
it
and
directed
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction.
and
obviously
when
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction,
when
it
got
back
there,
the
question
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
did
in
that
case
would
be
considered.
ultimately,
ultimately
there
were
no
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
because
at
the
conclusion
of
the
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
that
was
the
end
of
it.
and
justice
marshall
has
suggested
that
that
could
possibly
be
the
case
here,
and
it
might
very
well.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
at
this
juncture
this
court
can
determine
the
facts
as
they're
developed
subsequently.
and
certainly,
justice
white,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
on
remand
the
district
court
would
have
to
consider
the
separate
interests
of
the
organizations,
which--
mr.
morton
stavis
--well,
i
would
certainly
assume
that
everybody
is
going
to
wait
until
the
state
court
decides.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
and
whether
or
not
under
will
and
any
other
cases
other
parties
will
be
bound
by
what
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
may
have
decided
with
respect
to
lennox
hinds
remains
to
be
seen.
let
me
point
out
to
you
a
very
real
possibility.
a
very
real
possibility
is
for
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
to
say
several
things.
it
could
say
that
obviously
lennox
hinds
wasn't
counsel
in
the
case;
this
issue,
this
matter
shouldn't
have
been
prosecuted
because
he
wasn't
counsel,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
the
court
of
appeals...
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
could
decide
that
rule
8102,
which
is
a
rule
that
specifically
deals
with
criticism
of
judges,
should
have
been
the
rule
applicable
instead
of
dr
7-107.
well,
supposing
it
decides
that.
then
the
organizations
come
along
and
say
but
the
court
hasn't
adjudicated
the
question
of
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
and
that's
an
issue
which
remains
and
an
issue
which
we
as
three
black
organizations
are
very
seriously
concerned
about.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
yes.
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
pointed
out
that
there
wasn't
a
record
upon
which
it
could
decide
that
particular
question.
i'm
referring
particularly
to
the
doran
case.
there
wasn't
a
kind
of
record
at
which
you
could
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
separate
entrance.
and
that's
an
issue
that
will
have
to
be
returned
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
the
district
court.
but
you
can't
decide
that
now.
you
have
no
more
record
on
that
than
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit;
so
that
even
if
you
were
to
decide,
as
you
press,
justice
white,
that
maybe
we
could
make
a
decision
on
this
with
respect
to
the
hinds
case,
you
can't
make
a
decision
with
respect
to
the
interests
of
the
other
organizations;
and
they
have
an
interest
and
a
constitutional
interest
in
this
matter
which
far
transcends
the
immediate
question
of
mr.
hinds.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
suggested
for
one
moment
that
justice
rehnquist
nullified
the
abstention
doctrine
or
this
court
nullified
it
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
doran
case.
i
really
don't
think
so,
nor
in
the
steffel
case,
nor
in
a
whole
series
of
cases
where
you
recognized
that
there
was
a
sharp
distinction
between
threatened
prosecution
and
actual
prosecution.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
was
a
statement
of
charges.
mr.
morton
stavis
precisely
not.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
morton
stavis
--no,
no.
no,
no.
i'm
leaving
aside
the
question
as
to
whether
it's
an
administrative
proceeding.
because
under
the
rules
of
discipline
in
new
jersey,
after
the
statement
of
charges
there
is
a
hearing
at
which
the
district
ethics
committee
determines
whether
to
make
a
charge.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
it's
extremely
important
that
that
distinction
be
absolutely.
that
is
not
the
presentment.
it
is
not
the
charges.
it
is
an
internal
consideration
of
the
matter
within
the
district
ethics
committee.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes.
it's
a
letter
of
the
prosecutor
to
an
individual
saying
i'm
thinking
of
making
a
charge
against
you
under
such
and
such
a
statute,
and
i'd
like
you
to
come
in
and
talk
to
me
about
it,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
talking
to
me
about
it
i
will
decide
whether
to
file
an
indictment.
it
is
not
an
indictment.
it
is
not
a
presentment.
it
is
in
that
precise
prosecutive
stage
that
i
suggested,
and
that's
what
the
rules
say
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
found.
now,
i
just
want
to
conclude
by
making
what
i
think
is
the
most
fundamental
point
here,
and
that
is
that
when
the
congress
adopted
the
civil
rights
act
and
adopted
1331
and
1343,
it
provided,
intended
to
provide
that
the
litigants
would
have
the
choice
of
forum
in
adjudicating
federal
constitutional
issues.
you
decided
monroe
against
pape.
you've
never
departed
from
monroe
against
pape.
and
that
is
that
litigants
who
feel
threatened
in
the
exercise
of
their
federal
constitutional
rights
have
the
option
of
going
to
the
federal
or
the
state
courts
to
have
those
matters
adjudicated.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
prayer
of
a
suggestion
that
younger
against
harris
applied
to
this
case
at
the
time
that
the
case
started
in
the
federal
district
court.
now,
federal
jurisdiction
is
not
a
shell
game.
federal
jurisdiction
is
not
something
that
here
you
see
it
and
here
you
don't.
federal
jurisdiction--
mr.
morton
stavis
--nor
is
state
jurisdiction
over
its
lawyers.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
was
singularly
sensitive
to
that
point
and
said
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
do
your
thing.
it
may
very
well
be
that
you'll
limit
this
whole
matter,
and
this
whole
case
may
disappear.
but
not
for
that
reason,
not
for
that
reason
does
it
seem
to
me
that
the
original
choice
of
forum
made
by
the
litigant
in
accordance
with
monroe
against
pape
is
to
be
dismissed.
and
the
third
circuit
said
that
we
have
to
be,
we
have
to
determine
this
on
the
basis
of
that
choice
of
forum
made
on
the
facts
that
that's
what
you've--
mr.
morton
stavis
--thank
you
very
much.
