ms.
mary
ann
burgess
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
present
case
involves
a
strong
public
policy
consistently
fostered
by
this
court
against
interference
with
state
proceedings
by
federal
courts
either
by
way
of
injunction
or
declaratory
remarks.
the
court
below
declined
to
follow
this
policy
and
interfered
in
an
ongoing
state
bar
disciplinary
process,
thereby
inserting
itself
into
the
delicate
relationship
between
a
state
judiciary
and
attorney's
license
to
practice
before
it.
the
case
therefore
provides
this
court
with
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
application
of
the
policy
of
noninterference
articulated
in
younger
and
amplified
by
its
progeny
to
attorney
disciplinary
proceedings,
and
to
firmly
establish
the
appropriateness
of
federal
noninterference
to
such
proceedings
which
involve
such
significant
and
important
state
concerns.
it
must
be
underscored
that
what
this
case
does
not
involve
is
the
constitutionality
of
particular
disciplinary
rules
or
whether
an
attorney
violated
those
rules.
what
is
at
stake
is
whether
the
state
supreme
court
can
articulate
and
develop
standards
governing
attorney
discipline
and
discipline
attorneys
who
have
been
charged
with
violating
those
standards
free
and
unfettered
from
federal
intervention.
however,
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
the
issues
that
this
raises
it
is
necessary
to
briefly
discuss
the
factual
setting
in
which
it
arose.
the
case
has
its
origin
in
the
criminal
trial
of
joanne
chesimard
who
was
charged
with
the
murder
of
a
new
jersey
state
trooper.
during
the
jury
selection
process
in
this
trial
lennox
hinds,
an
attorney
in
new
jersey,
called
a
press
conference
concerning
the
conduct
of
that
trial,
and
more
particular,
that
of
the
trial
judge.
reports
of
the
press
conference--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--it
is
my
understanding,
chief
justice,
that
there
was
an
order
of
some
type
directed
to
the
counsel
in
the
case,
and
i
believe
that
during
the
press
conference
mr.
hinds
indicated
that
he
was
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
counsel
in
the
case
because
they
had
been
gagged
by
the
trial
court
judge.
that
was
report
in
the
news
article
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
daily
news
and
the
newark
star
ledger.
the
report--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--he
was
not
of
counsel
in
that
particular
trial,
yes,
chief
justice.
it
was
reported
in
these
articles
that
mr.
hinds
had
called
the
proceeding
a
travesty,
had
indicated
that
judge
appleby,
the
trial
judge,
was
without
judicial
temperament
or
racial
sensitivity
to
sit
as
an
objective
judge
in
this
particular
trial.
it
was
reported
that
he
called
the...
that
he
accused
the
judge
of
asking
self-serving
questions
which
was
leading
to
the
creation
of
a
hangman's
court.
david
foley,
a
member
of
the
middlesex
county
ethics
committee,
brought
these
articles
to
the
attention
of
the
committee.
he
was
authorized
to
investigate
the
matter
and
determine
whether
there
were
any
possible
infractions
of
the
new
jersey
disciplinary
rules.
he
communicated
by
letter
with
mr.
hinds
and
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
meet
with
him
and
discuss
the
reports
that
had
been
circulated,
had
been
reported
in
the
papers.
mr.
hinds
declined
to
meet
with
mr.
foley,
and
although
the
attorney
disciplinary
process
is
a
private,
confidential
process,
he
disclosed
that
initial
communication
at
a
press
conference,
and
it
was
widely
publicized
in
the
papers.
in
order
to
protect
the
jury
trial
that
was
still
in
process
the
committee
determined
not
to
proceed
with
the
investigation
until
the
trial
itself
had
been
concluded.
when
it
was
concluded,
the
investigation
was
reactivated
and
mr.
foley
again
attempted
to
meet
with
mr.
hinds
to
discuss
the
matter.
after
several
unsuccessful
attempts,
the
investigation
went
on
without
mr.
hinds'
cooperation.
when
it
was
concluded,
mr.
foley
recommended
that
a
statement
of
charges
be
filed
against
mr.
hinds.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
certainly.
indicating
that
he
had
been...
had
violated
disciplinary
rule
1-102(a)(5)
in
that
the
statements
were
prejudicial
to
the
administration
of
justice;
and
secondly,
that
these
statements
violated
dr
7-107(d)
in
that
they
were
made
during
the
jury
selection
process
and
were
reasonably
likely
to
interfere
with
a
fair
trial
in
that
they
were
intended
to
influence
the
taking
of
prospective
jurors.
the
latter
disciplinary
rule
had
been
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
shepherd
v.
maxwell
wherein
the
court
urged
all
state
courts
to
adopt
rules
designed
to
protect
the
criminal
trial
process
from
prejudicial
outside
interferences
in
order
to
assure
a
fair
trial
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment.
in
accordance
with
the
recommendations
of
mr.
foley
the
committee
did
in
fact
issue
a
statement
of
charges
against
lennox
hinds.
however,
instead
of
answering
those
charges,
mr.
hinds
initiated...
mr.
hinds,
together
with
three
organizations
of
minority
attorneys,
initiated
a
complaint
in
federal
district
court.
in
that
action
they
sought
to
enjoin
the
ethics...
the
processing
of
the
ethics
complaint
and
also
to
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
disciplinary
rules
under
which
he
was
charged
were
unconstitutional.
significantly,
the
complaint
never
alleged
that
mr.
hinds
could
not
adjudicate
these
constitutional
claims
within
the
context
of
the
new
jersey
attorney
disciplinary
process.
rather,
it
suggests...
actually
it
states
that
these...
both
the
ethics
committee
and
the
supreme
court
were
somehow
biased
and
that
they
could
not
objectively
review
the
constitutionality
of
the
rules
that
had
been
adopted
by
the
supreme
court.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
under
younger
abstention,
concluding
that
principles
of
comity
and
federalism
dictate
that
the
federal
court
abstain
so
that
the
state
court
could
consider
the
constitutionality
of
its
disciplinary
rules
free
from
federal
intervention.
it
therefore
rejected
the
claims
that
both
the
ethics
committee
and
the
supreme
court
were
somehow
biased
tribunals
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
their
own
regulations.
plaintiffs
moved
to
amend
for
the
limited
purpose
of
permitting
the
plaintiffs
to...
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
either
the
bad
faith
or
harassment
which
would
operate
as
an
exception
to
the
younger
abstention
doctrine.
there
was
extensive
discovery
and
two
days
of
hearings
before
the
trial
judge.
a
supplemental
opinion...
in
a
supplemental
opinion
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
had
totally
failed
to
meet
their
burden
of
demonstrating
either
the
bad
faith
or
harassment
which
would
operate
as
an
exception
to
younger
abstention.
the
plaintiffs
appealed
and
moved
for
a
stay
before
the
trial
court,
which
was
granted.
so,
in
fact,
the
processing
of
the
disciplinary
matter
before
the
ethics
committee
was
stayed
in
april
of
1980.
in
its
decision
below,
the
third
circuit
concluded
that
the
district
court
had
abused
its
discretion
when
it
dismissed
on
younger
absention
grounds.
this
decision
represents
a
radical
departure
from
the
well-established
tradition
of
federal
noninterference
in
pending
state
attorney
disciplinary
proceedings.
the
third
circuit
posits
a
very
novel
basis
for
justifying
federal
intrusion
into
the
delicate
and
unique
relationship
between
the
supreme
court
and
attorneys'
license
to
practice
before
it.
the
court
initially
fragmented
the
ethics
committee
segment
of
a
unitary
disciplinary
process
or
the
remainder
of
that
process.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
depend
on
the
actual
conclusion
or
finding
at
the
ethics
committee
level.
it
is
true
that
it
is
only
the
ethics
committee
that
develops
a
record
in
a
particular--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--they
are
the
arm
that
hears
the
matter
for
the
court.
there
are
three
areas
in
which
they
can
make
final
determinations.
if
they
find
that
there
is
no
indication
of
unethical
conduct
they
can
dismiss.
they
can
do
that
either
before
the
investigation
when
they
got
the
initial
complaint
or
after
the
hearing
they
determine
there
is
no
unethical
conduct.
so
in
two
instances
they
can
dismiss.
those
would
be
final
determinations.
they
could
make
a
final--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--they
could
be
on
motion
of
the...
if
a
complainant
comes,
makes
a--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--if
a
complainant
raises
a
problem
with
an
attorney
and
the
ethics
committee
reviews
it
and
finds
no
basis
to
file
charges,
that
individual
can
go
the
next
step
and
seek
a
review
of
that
determination.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
so
the
disciplinary
review
board
does
review,
has
an
appellate
function
with
regard
to
certain
actions
of
the
ethics
committee.
if
the
ethics
committee
reviews
the
record
and
considers
the
evidence
that
has
been
produced,
it
can
determine
that
there
is
unethical
conduct
but
it
only
warrants
what
is
called
minor
discipline,
a
private
reprimand.
that
also
is
a
final
judgment
by
the
committee
and
can
be
reviewed
again
by
the
disciplinary
review
board.
if
after
a
hearing
on
notice
of
evidence,
consideration
of
the
factors
that
have
been
developed,
they
determine
that
there
is
significant...
potential
significant
violation
of
ethical
conduct,
they
can
recommend
that
what
is
called
major
discipline
be
taken.
they
cannot
impose
that
major
discipline.
and
that
triggers
the
process
which
was
discussed
by
respondents
called
presentment.
actually,
a
presentment
is--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--is
a
finding
of
fact
and
a
recommendation
of
major
discipline.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's...
well,
it
would
go
to
the
disciplinary
review
board
which
would
review
it,
make
a
determination
which
can
only
be
imposed
by
the
supreme
court.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
yes.
yes,
mr.--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's
right.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
it
would
be
legal
argument.
the
only
record,
though,
the
factual
record,
would
be
that
record
which
had
been
held
by
the--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--ethics
committee.
the
third
circuit
in
fact
fragmented
the
ethics
committee
from
the
totality
of
the
disciplinary
process
concluding
that
when
a
matter
is
pending
before
the
ethics
committee
it
is
not
pending
before
the
supreme
court.
looking
at
it
in
this
very
isolated
fashion,
they
felt...
they
concluded
that
an
attorney
charged
with
a
violation
could
not
raise
constitutional
issues
and
have
them
adjudicated
by
the
ethics
committee,
which
is
correct.
it
could
not
be
adjudicated
at
that
level.
it
could
be
raised
at
that
level
and
ultimately
adjudicated.
they
could
be
raised
at
that
level,
and
through
either
a
motion
to
the
supreme
court
there
could
be
a
review
prior
to
a
final--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
yes.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
to
the
supreme
court?
yes,
chief
justice.
they
would
be
the
ones
involving
major
discipline:
disbarment,
temporary
suspension,
something
of
that
nature.
a
private
reprimand,
unless
the
attorney
involved
or
the
complainant
involved
felt
it
should
go
any
higher,
would
probably
not
prosecute
it
any
higher
than
that.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
everything
is
pending
in
our
supreme
court.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
no.
that
would
suggest
that
the
constitutional
issues
involved
warranted
review
by
the
court.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
the
matter
is
still
pending
in
the
district
court
level.
after
the--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--oh.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's
right.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's
right.
it
was
prosecuted
on
behalf
of
the
ethics
committee
by
the
attorney
who
is
in
charge
of
ethics
within
the
court
system;
so
she
was
the
prosecuting
agent,
mr.
hinds
was
defendant
and
respondent
to
that
charge.
but
it's
pending
now.
it
has
been...
the
constitutional
issues
have
been
fully
briefed.
there
has
been
oral
argument,
and
we're
pending
and
waiting
for
the
results.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
there
has
been
no
decision.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
there
has
been
a
factual
change.
it
was
our
position
that
the
district
court...
which
it
did
do,
it
did
abstain
from
interfering
in
the
process;
that
that
was
a
proper
act
for
the
district
court.
when
it
was
appealed
to
the
third
circuit,
they
felt
that
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we
petitioned
for
a
rehearing.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
state
supreme
court
indicated
its
willingness,
being
apprised
of
this
particular
matter,
that
it
would
hear
the
constitutional
claims
of
lennox
hinds.
we
apprised
the
third
circuit
in
our
petition
for
rehearing
of
that
fact.
the
third
circuit
said
that
what
was
of
importance
was
the
factual
situation
at
the
time
the
complaint
arose,
not
as
of
the
time
that
they
were
reviewing
it
at
that
point,
which
was
about
a
two-year
lapse.
so
they
felt
that
when
the
complaint
was
filed
mr.
hinds
could
not
have
an
adjudication
of
his
constitutional
rights
before
the
ethics
committee.
they
refused
to
vacate
or
reconsider
their
decision
because
even
though
the
matter
was
now
fully
before
the
supreme
court...
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
mr.
hinds
has
ample
opportunity
to
have
his
constitutional
claims
adjudicated
by
that
body,
which
certainly
constitutes
a
competent
tribunal
to
adjudicate
these
constitutional...
federal
constitutional
claims.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
in
its
decision,
sir,
petition
for
rehearing,
they
indicated
they
had
no
trouble
or
problem
with
concurrent
proceedings,
one
in
the
district
court,
one
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
which
it's
our
view
runs
seriously
counter
to
the
notions
of
comity
and
federalism;
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
this
duplicitous,
duplicative
process
that
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
will
come
to
one
conclusion
on
the
constitutionality
in
its
adjudication
of
those
issues,
and
let's
assume
mr.
hinds
is
not
satisfied
with
that,
rather
than
bringing
that
final
determination
of
the
16
supreme
court
to
this
court,
he
has
the
opportunity
and
the
option...
it's
clearly
contemplated
in
the
third
circuit
opinion...
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
to
have
his
claims
adjudicated
by
that
court,
which
would
really
cast
serious
doubt
on
the
objectivity
and
the
ability
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
to
objectively
and
adequately
resolve
constitutional
issues.
and
i
think
that
really--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--it's
not
what...
it
does
not
affect
it
at
this
point.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
i'm
sorry.
it
is
not,
in
effect,
precluding
the
supreme
court
at
this
point
from
adjudicating
those
claims.
the
possibility
is
that
the
federal
district
court
will
be
reviewing
that
final
determination
or
will
be
reviewing
those
issues
and
reaching
a
contrary
result
if
mr.
hinds
is
dissatisfied
with
the
results
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
with
regard
to
the
imposition
of
discipline
it's
correct
that
only
the
major
matters
would
get
to
the
supreme
court
where
there
would
be
possible
disbarment.
but
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
disciplinary
rule
under
which
an
individual
is
charged
is
constitutional
or
not,
it's
quite
possible
that
through
a
motion
practice,
a
motion
made
to
the
supreme
court
to
review
that
issue
before
there
was
any
significance,
either
a
hearing
at
the
ethics
committee
level
or
something
of
that
nature,
it
could
well
have
reached
the
supreme
court.
there
has
been
a
history
in
our
court
of
a
very
flexible
procedure
with
regard
to
attorney
disciplinary
matters.
so
that
while
a
matter
is
pending
before
an
ethics
committee
there
can
be
motions
made
to
the
supreme
court
to
resolve
procedural
issues
or
perhaps
constitutional
challenges.
and,
in
fact,
this
flexible
procedure
has
been
memorialized
in
a
new
court
rule
which
provides
that
when
a
matter
is
initiated,
when
there
is
a
disciplinary
matter
initiated,
the
individual
can
move
the
supreme
court
for
direct
resolution
of
constitutional
issues
which
may
be
implicated.
it's
interlocutory.
there's
a
motion
for
leave
to
resolve
those
issues.
if
the
court
does
not
take
it...
and
that
would,
of
course,
depend
on
the
seriousness
of
the
constitutional
challenge,
the
individual
is
required
to
preserve
his
constitutional
challenge
in
the
answer
to
the
disciplinary
charges.
and
if
the
matter
does
proceed
to
formal
discipline,
it
would
be
resolved
within
that
context.
so
it
would
always
be...
the
ability
to
raise
the
constitutional
challenge
would
always
be
there
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's
right.
it's
quite
possible
that
in
reviewing
the
application
of
the
rule
that
mr.
hinds
may
not
have
fallen
within
the
ambit
of
it.
that's
a
possibility.
i
couldn't
say.
it
doesn't
talk
about
counsel.
it
says
associated
with
the
defense
or
prosecution
of
a
particular
matter.
so
the
question
is
what
does
associated
with
the
defense
or
prosecution
mean;
does
it
mean
of
counsel
or
does
it
mean
something
broader
than
that
and
something
less
than
that?
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
it
could
well
include--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--there
hasn't
been
any
definitive
rules
on
that.
that
is
the
issue--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--in
our
supreme
court
proceeding?
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
in
the
supreme
court
they
did
argue
that
it
was
broader
than
of
counsel.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that
it
could
extend
to
individuals
who
had
certain
contacts--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--that's
the
position.
as
i
said,
it
hasn't
been
resolved
by
the
court
as
yet.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's
true,
mr.
justice.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
it's
my
fault.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
well--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--what's
before
them
is
the
constitutionality--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--they
could
dismiss
the
charge
against
mr.
hinds,
yes.
they
could
find
that
he
is
not--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--it
would
still
leave
the
application
or
the
failure
to
apply
younger
abstention
in
this
particular
case,
where
rather
than
dismissing
the
complaint
in
the
district
court
and
permitting
the
state
court
to
go
forward
unfettered
in
adjudicating
the
complaint--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--well,
that's
assuming--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--that's
assuming
that
the
court
in
effect
finds
its
rules
unconstitutional
and--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--there
would
still
be
the
pendency
of
the
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court.
rather
than
having
dismissed
that,
it
permitted
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
to
proceed
on
adjudication
of
these
complaints.
there
is
still
that
determination.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
and
i
think...
excuse
me.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
well,
if
this
court
would
return
or
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
the
case
involving
lennox
hinds
would
be
over.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
it
could
be
analogized
to
precisely
that
type
of
situation.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
it
certainly
is
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
court
itself
has
characterized
it
as
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
it
utilizes
the
ethics
committees
to
hear
matters
for
it.
that
is
precisely
their
function.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
brennan.
i
believe
it
is
totally
within
the
ambit
now
of
the
ethics
committees.
and
in
new
jersey
this
is
particularly
significant
since
the
supreme
court
has
plenary
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
both
admission
to
the
bar
and
disciplining
attorneys
by
way
of
express
constitutional
provision.
so,
that
is,
really
the
people
who
through
their
constitution
have
permitted
total
control
over
admission
to
the
bar
and
discipline
of
members
to
the
bar
to
the
supreme
court.
so
that
when
the
third
circuit
failed
to
permit
the
supreme
court
to
fulfill
that
function
unfettered
by
federal
intervention,
it
was
in
fact
not
only
thwarting...
it
was
in
fact
thwarting
the
will
of
the
people
to
have
that
precise
function
fulfilled
by
the
body
that
had
been
designated
to
do
it.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
respond
initially
to
the--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--to
the
characterization--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--to
the
characterization
of
the
issuance
of
the
statement
of
charges.
in
the
hinds
case
an
initial
complaint
had
been
received.
an
investigation
had
been
authorized.
a
report
was
made
to
the
entire
committee,
and
they
then
in
fact
authorized
the
official
issuance
of
a
statement
of
charges
which
was
served
upon
mr.
hinds
in
that
matter.
that
generated
what
we
view
as
the
adjudicative
part
of
the
process.
a
hearing
would
result,
and
a
determination
based
on
the
facts
elicited
at
that
hearing
would
lead
to
a
recommendation
either
to
dismiss,
to
impose
minor
discipline,
or
to
forward
the
matter
on
for
major
discipline.
so
it
is
our
contention
that
we
are
not
in
a
pre-prosecutorial
stage
but
rather
the
judicial
portion
of
it
had
been
commenced
by
the
official
filing
of
charges.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that
precise
issue
is
not
briefed
in
the
third
circuit.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
was...
that
mr.
hinds
certainly
has
participated
in
the
supreme
court.
there
was
an
application
by
another
group,
which
is
in
none
of
the
groups
involved,
in
the
district
court,
a
federal
matter,
to
participate
as
amicus.
so
these
three
groups
are
not
involved
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
their
rights
are
merely
derivative
or
so
intertwined
with
mr.
hinds'
rights
that
they
cannot
interfere
with
that
ongoing
state
proceeding.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
they
are
precisely
the
same.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
precisely.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
certainly.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
certainly.
and
they
could
be
remitted
to
resolve
that
issue
within
the
pending
state
proceeding,
certainly,
because
the
state
supreme
court
does
permit
the
participation
of
amicus
groups.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
no,
your
honor.
it's
very
real,
and
there
should
be
some
sort
of
resolution
to
our
claim.
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--your
honor,
it
was
the
charge
involving
lennox
hinds
which
was
before
the
district
ethics
committee.
certainly--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--that
was
the
only...
was
the
only
individual
involved
in
the
new
jersey
proceeding.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
there
are
non...
that's
right...
there
are
non-state/federal
litigants
in
this
matter.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
they
could
move
to
participate
in
the
matter.
they
could
be
remitted
to
participate
in
the--
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
--yes.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
yes.
ms.
mary
ann
burgess
that's
right.
the
supreme
court
has
original
jurisdiction
to
review
the
constitutionality
of
either
its
disciplinary
rules
or
its
court
rules
absent
an
actual
disciplinary
proceeding,
and
our
brief
indicates
instances
where
in
fact
it
has
done
that.
it
will
entertain
a
petition
for
review.
and
if
they
segregated
the
lennox
hinds'
matter
as
applied
from
that,
they
could
still
move
on
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
those
particular
rules.
