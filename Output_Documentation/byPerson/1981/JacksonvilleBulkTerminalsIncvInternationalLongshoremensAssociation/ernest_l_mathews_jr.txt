mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
very
start
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
the
dispute
in
this
case
is
not
over
occidental's
choice
of
a
customer.
i
don't
know
why
but
of
all
the
parties
that
have
been
involved
in
the
litigation
involving
this
activity
by
the
union
occidental
seems
to
think
that
it
is
the
center
of
the
universe
and
that
our
quarrel
is
with
it.
now,
whether
that
is
because
they
closely
identify
with
the
soviet
union
or
they
just
have
a
ptolemy
complex
i
don't
know.
but
every
court--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--it
would
depend,
your
honor.
i
would
say--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--it
would
be
the
same
if
the
union's
motivation
was
the
same;
that
is
to
say,
if
the
union
simply
said
i'm
not
going
to
handle
airplanes
to
taiwan,
that's
one
thing.
where
the
union
says
i
will
not
handle
airplanes
to
a
certain
country
where
that
country
is
engaged
in
an
act
of
international
barbarism,
that's
quite
another
thing.
it's
not
simply
well,
we
like
this
country;
we
don't
like
that
country.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
i
think
it's
very
different.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
because
what
inspired
the
union's
activity
in
this
case
was
something
that
really
affronted
the
conscience
of
the
entire
world.
it
was
the
invasion
of
afghanistan.
it
was
not
simply
that
russia
is
an
inimical
country,
that
it
has
a
communist
system,
or
it
does
things
we
don't
like.
it
was
a
transcendent
act,
something
that
not
only
shocked
the
union
but
shocked
the
president
of
the
united
states,
shocked
people
all
over
the
world.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
and
i
suppose
this
court
knows...
well,
it
has
been
called
to
your
attention...
that
the
ila
has
now
ceased
handling
goods
going
to
poland.
i
think
it's
a
slightly
different
thing
because
in
poland
we
do
have
a
labor
dispute.
the
barbarism
there
is
breaking
a
strike
with
bayonets
and
tanks.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
it
was.
political
and
conscientious.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
there's
no
argument
about
that.
we
would
agree
with
occidental
that
the
underlying
dispute
in
this
case
is
a
political
dispute,
is
not
a
labor
dispute,
is
not
even
in
domestic
american
commerce.
where
we
disagree
is
that
that
underlying
dispute
is
not
that
subject
of
occidental's
lawsuit.
occidental
is
suing
on
its
contract.
it
is
an
employer
suing
the
union
that
represents
its
employees
to
enforce
a
provision
to
provide
labor.
and
if
that
is
not
a
labor
dispute,
i
really
don't
know
what
is.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
belabor
the
point.
if
you
don't
see
it,
then--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
the
norris-laguardia
act
forbids
the
federal
courts
or
removes
their
jurisdiction
from
granting
an
injunction
in
cases
arising
out
of
or
involving
labor
disputes.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
dispute:
does
our
no
strike
clause
require
us
to
give
labor.
it's
the
basic
thing
about--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
the--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--is
wages,
hours,
conditions.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
it
is
a
term
and
condition
of
an
employment
contract,
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
what
they
are
suing
on,
one
of
the
conditions,
one
of
the
terms
of
their
labor
contract.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
they
try
to
bring
in
a
few
others
but--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes.
in
effect,
a
no
strike
clause
is
an
affirmative
promise
to
work.
what
they're
seeking
is
specific
performance
of
a
promise
to
provide
labor.
i'd
say
that's
a
labor
dispute.
that's
a
term
and
condition
of
labor.
we
will
supply
labor
in,
as
occidental
says,
in
all
circumstances.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that
is
true.
and
i
would
say
that--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no.
because--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
the
language
of
norris-laguardia
in
the
light
of
the
arbitration
clause
is
the
next
segment
of
this
case;
that
is,
the
boys
market-buffalo
forge
analysis.
whether
or
not
the
case
here
involves
a
labor
dispute
is
the
first
part
of
it.
now,
we
have
to
get
under
norris-laguardia
before
we
see
whether
it
falls
under
an
exception.
we
say
that
an
action...
and
the
solicitor
general,
who
in
all
other
respects
this
afternoon
you
will
find
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
table,
agrees
with
us.
it
is
a
labor
dispute.
it's
the
meaning
of
a
labor
contract
and
a
no
strike
clause.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
if
there
were
no
no
strike
clause
in
the
contract,
occidental
would
not
be
here
today.
they'd
have
no
standing
to
sue.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
they
would
have
no
lawsuit.
they're
suing
to
enforce
the
no
strike--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
i
would
have
to
answer
that
in
a
qualified
way,
justice
stevens.
it
would
have
to
be...
they
might
manufacture
some
other
clause
and
say
we
have
labor
dispute
with
you
about
some
other
clause
of
the
contract.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
oh,
then,
no.
then
i
would--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--if
it
were
not
on
the
contract,
no,
i
couldn't
say
it
was.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
i'd
have
to
be
a
little
broader.
it
turns
on
the
fact
that
they
are
suing
on
their
labor
contract
on
a
promise,
an
alleged
promise
to
perform
labor.
if
they
were
suing
in
tort
and
not
in
contract,
then
i
couldn't
say
that
labor--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes.
a
labor
contract.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
it's
a
301
case,
and
that
is
the
only
way
they
have
federal
jurisdiction
if
this
is
a
labor
contract.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
well,
no.
the
resulting
dispute
is
or
may
be
arbitrable.
now
we
get
into
the
buffalo
forge
case.
the
underlying
dispute,
the
thing
that
the
union
struck
over
was
the
soviet
action
in
afghanistan.
we
had
no
dispute
with
occidental.
our
attitude
is
the
longshoremen
do
not
wish
to
give
their
services
to
the
aggressors
while
the
aggression
is
going
on.
it
is
a
moral,
conscientious
choice
just
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
these
people,
something
akin
to
toscanini
refusing
to
perform
in
germany
or
italy
while
there
were
fascist
dictatorships
there.
but
even
worse
because
it
was
triggered
by,
you
know,
not
simply
a
disagreement
with
what
the
soviet
union
is
but
by
a
real
act
of
terrorism.
that
underlying
dispute
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
it
is
not
arbitrable
under
the
contract
with
jbt,
and
it
is
also
really
not
the
subject
of
this
lawsuit.
buffalo
forge--
well,
before
we
get
to
buffalo
forge
we
have
to
talk
about
boys
market.
norris-laguardia
does
not
permit
specific
performance
of
labor
contracts.
it
bars
federal
courts
from
granting
injunctions,
including
mandatory
injunctions,
in
cases
involving
labor
disputes.
this
court--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--and
that
is
what
boys
market
held.
but
except
for
labor
arbitration
clauses.
those
clauses
can
be
specifically
enforced
under
the
boys
market
doctrine.
the
question
is,
though,
or
what
the
purpose,
the
thrust
of
boys
market
is,
not
to
grant
specific
performance
of
any
other
clause
of
the
contract
willy
nilly,
but
to
promote
the
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration.
it
is
in
aid
of
arbitration,
not
in
aid
of
stopping
strikes,
of
keeping
people
from
being
involved
in
management
rights
or
anything
else.
boys
market
is
tied
very
closely
to
arbitration.
so
that
this
court
in
buffalo
forge
held
that
if
the
underlying
dispute,
if
the
thing
over
which
the
union
is
striking
cannot
be
resolved
by
arbitration,
then
boys
market
doesn't
apply;
because
all
you
would
be
doing
by
granting
an
injunction
would
be
enforcing
some
substantive
provision
of
the
contract
other
than
the
arbitration
clause.
but
the
court
also
recognized
that
even
though
the
underlying
dispute
cannot
be
arbitrated,
the
union's
action
in
response
to
that
dispute
could
violate
a
broad
no
strike
clause,
and
that's
where
the
no
strike
clause
comes
in.
if
you
had
a
narrow
no
strike
clause,
let
us
say
as
we
did
in
the
case
in
the
northern
district
of
new
york,
which
is,
i
think,
attached
to
one
of
the
papers
before
the
court,
the
no
strike
clause
merely
said
the
union
won't
strike
while
arbitration
is
going
on.
but
once
you
find
there
can't
be
any
arbitration
going
on
over
the
invasion
of
afghanistan,
the
no
strike
clause
is
never
triggered,
and
the
district
court
very
quickly
dismissed
the
case.
but
where
you
have
a
broad--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--that's
right.
that
is
the
second
condition.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no.
there
can't
be
any
arbitration
about
afghanistan.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
we
could
have
arbitration
on
whether
he
commits
a
tort,
but--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes.
what
this
contract
requires.
the
arbitrator
could
rule
on
whether
or
not
striking
over
a
non
arbitrable
issue
violates
the--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no
strike
clause.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no,
we're
not
interested
in
it.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
they're
the
plaintiff.
they're
the
ones
who
are
claiming
we're
violating
the
no
strike
clause.
we
take
the
position--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--not
really,
because
we
don't
think
we're
violating
the
contract.
we
take
the
position
that
our
promise
not
to
strike
is
coterminous
with
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
it
is
the
quid
pro
quo,
one
before
the
other.
the
union
gives
up
its
economic
weapon,
striking,
if
its
grievances
can
be
resolved
by
the
method
of
arbitration.
and
this
phrase
"quid
pro
quo",
which
my
friend
objects
to,
appears,
i
think,
in
every
case
involving
arbitration
clause.
i'm
amazed.
it's
a
leitmotif
of
wagnerian
dimensions.
always
when
you
mention
arbitration
clause,
no
strike
clause,
the
balance
is
quid
pro
quo.
so
we
agreed
not
to
strike
where
we
could
get
satisfaction
by
arbitration,
but
we
did
not
agree
not
to
strike
where
the
employer
cannot
redress
our
grievance,
and
where
the
arbitrator
cannot
redress
our
grievance,
where
the
result
is
that
mechanistically
we
simply
have
to
go
on
servicing
these
butchers
in
a
situation
that
is
morally
unconscionable
for
our
men.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that
could
be
drafted,
it
could
be
bargained
for,
yes.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that's
not--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--oh,
no,
i
don't.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
pending
arbitration.
and
it
may
not
be--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--absolutely.
and
we
have
elsewhere.
if
the
arbitrator
rules
that
we
are
violating
it.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i'll
tell
you,
i've
spent
some
hours
drafting
the
opposite,
what
would
happen
if
this
court
goes
the
other
way,
and
putting
in
a
provision,
as
i
say,
hey,
look,
this
no
strike
clause
is
no
broader
than--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--and
i've
really
never
even
thought
if
we
yielded
whether
that
could
be--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no,
it's
certainly
not.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
they
might,
or
we
might--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--right.
or
agree--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
we
can
waive
a
right
that
congress
gives
us.
congress
takes
the
jurisdiction
away--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no.
we
might
waive
removing
it
to
federal
court
and
let
them
sue
in
the
state
courts
where
norris-laguardia
doesn't
apply
or
something
like
that.
but
as
a
practical...
it's
one
that
never
occurred
to
me,
your
honor.
going
back
for
a
moment,
though,
to
that
quid
pro
quo
theory
and
the
coterminous
theory,
that
is
not
an
outlandish
theory.
that
is
the
position
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
it's
the
position
of
the
third
circuit.
it's
the
position
of
the
first
circuit.
and
i
believe
the
sixth
circuit
takes
another
view.
but
because
the
union
only
gives
up
its
economic
right
when
it
receives
another
forum
where
it
can
get
redress,
the
courts
and
the
board
have
found
that
they
are
coterminous.
now,
they
are
only
coterminous
as
a
rule
of
construction,
and
the
parties
can
come
forward
and
show
evidence
that
the
real
intent
of
the
contracting
parties
was
something
else.
what
controls
is
the
intent
of
the
contracting
parties
to
the
no
strike
clause.
in
this
case,
the
no
strike
clause,
and
in
all
these
russian
cases,
there
is
a
history.
in
1964
the
union
did
a
similar
thing
over
the
cuban
missile
crisis.
there
have
been
other
instances.
and
i
think
the
employers
are
pretty
well
aware
that
the
union
has
taken
the
position
that
it
is
free
under
its
no
strike
clause
to
do
this.
when
the
arbitrator
tells
us
differently,
we
obey
and
go
back
to
work.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
again,
i'm
uncomfortable,
although
i
have
used
the
word
up
and
down
the
east
coast
with
this
idea
of
a
political
strike.
i
don't
want
the
court
to
have
the
idea
that
it's
a
political
strike
in
the
same
sense
as
we
had
in
england
in
the
early
part
of
this
century.
we
are
trying
to
affect
the
policies
of
the
united
states.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
this
particular
one
is
limited
to
russian--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--in
our
view?
well,
i
can
only
go
with
what
this
dispute
is,
and
in
fact,
the
ones
that
the
ila
has
been
involved
in
have
always
been
foreign
matters:
the
harboring
of
cuban
missiles,
the
invasion
of
afghanistan,
the
labor
policies
in
poland.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
very
different
ballgame
from
saying
we
don't--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--it
is
a
dispute
with
the
union.
yeah,
i
guess
i
would
have
to--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
right.
that
it's
non
arbitrable.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that
is
really
the
meaning
of
buffalo
forge.
it's
not
what
the
dispute
is.
it's
that
it
can't
be
settled
by
arbitration.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
well,
but
then
negotiating
it.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that's
right.
yes,
always,
in
all
of
this
whole
line
of
cases
the
parties,
if
they
can
get
each
other
to
agree
at
the
bargaining
table,
can
really
go
around
any
decision
except--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes,
they
have.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
but
that
is,
of
course,
what
the
arbitrator
has
got
to
decide.
is
this...
he
has
two
decisions.
first
he's
got
to
decide
is
the
strike
over
a
non
arbitrable
dispute,
an
arbitrable
question.
then
he
has
to
decide
is
it
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
because
we
are
not...
because
what
is
subject
to
arbitration...
well,
it
may
be
subject
to
arbitration
under
the
no
strike
clause,
but
it's
not
subject
to
arbitration
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
resolved
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no.
that
doesn't
resolve
our
underlying
dispute,
unless
he
is--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no,
no.
it's
an
arbitration
that
we're
sure
to
lose.
i
mean,
we
can
lose.
he
can
say,
you
know,
you've
got
to
go
back
to
work,
but
he
can
never
say
to
the
russians
get
out
of
afghanistan.
that's
the
issue
we
are
not
working
over.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
our
no
strike
clause.
well,
and
basically
under
the
contract.
i
think
certainly
if
the
contract
did
provide
a
kind
of
clause
that
said
the
no
strike
clause
only
applies
to
arbitrable
issues,
we'd
be
home
free
under
a
301
suit.
whether
we'd
be
home
free
under
a
secondary
boycott
charge
is
the
next
chapter
in
this
afternoon's
work.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
oh,
yes.
we
have
been.
as
i
say,
in
new
orleans
the
arbitrator
did
so
rule.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
certainly.
and
did
in
the
companion
case
with
jacksonville
bulk
in
the
general
new
orleans
steamship
association
case.
it
was
a
post
arbitration
award.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
he...
of
course,
i
was
not
a
party
to
the
arbitration
proceeding,
and
he
just
didn't
give
a
ground.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
that's
right.
he
said
that
you
promised
not
to
strike.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
the
international
was
not
involved.
it
was
only
the
new
orleans
local
that--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--i
really
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
his
holding
was,
and
he
didn't
order...
in
other
arbitrations
that
we
have
been
involved
in
that
certainly
is
the
position
we
take,
and
we
cite
the
position
of
the
board
and
of
the
third
circuit
and
so
forth,
and
we
cite
the
history.
i
mean
we
have
had
other
experiences
totally
unrelated
to
the
political
realm.
when
the
prospect
of
containerization
first
emerged,
this
new
technology,
there
was
a
general
agreement
between
management
and
labor
that
this
was
not
part
of
the
contract
that
we
had
on
the
books
on
that
time,
it
was
not
arbitrable,
and
we
could
strike
over
it.
now
the
contract
specifically
provides
that
containerization
is
not
an
arbitrable
item,
but
when
it
first
emerged...
i
mean
there
is
history
and
there
is
evidence
that
you
can
give
the
arbitrator.
but
the
point
is
it's
the
arbitrator
who
has
to
decide,
and
under
buffalo
forge
there
can
be
no
preliminary
injunction
until
he
does
decide;
because
as
this
case
points
out,
once
you
get
that
preliminary
injunction,
management
really
has
no
desire
to
arbitrate.
justice
marshall
suggested
we
didn't.
well,
we
are
the
defendants,
you
might
say,
in
that--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--right.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
and
of
course,
that's
exactly
what
occidental
or
jbt
did
in
this
case.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes,
i
would
have
to
agree,
to
be
candid.
if
it
is
not
arbitrable
under
the
contract,
you
can--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--which
would
not
be
arbitrable.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
key
is
not
that
it's
a
political
strike
but
that
it's
not
arbitrable,
and
i
would
have
to
agree,
yes,
i
suppose
if
a
union
did
that.
but,
you
remember,
you
have
the
great
safety
valve--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--conceivable
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
but
you
have,
as
i
say--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--the
safety
factor
is
that
the--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--union
members
have
to
eat.
i
mean
it's
unlikely
that
they're
going
to
strike
over
the
dogcatcher.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i
missed--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--they're
protected
by
norris-laguardia,
yes.
these
things,
any
of
these
strikes
are
very
rare
in
the
history
of
american
jurisprudence.
there
have
only
been
a
few.
and
the
ones
that
you've
had
have
really
been
over
real
blockbuster
issues.
you
had
it
over
south
africa's
racial
policies.
you
had
it
over
the
cuban
missile
crisis.
you
have
it
over
the
invasion
of
afghanistan.
now
you
have
it
over
poland.
these
aren't
dogcatchers.
these
aren't
that
we
don't
like--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--you
could,
you
could.
but
it
is
not
the
nature--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
this
case
turns
very
squarely
on
the
will
of
congress
in
norris-laguardia
to
take
the
federal
courts
out
of
the
injunction
business.
and
this
court,
sticking
to
its
guns,
to
what
it
said
in
buffalo
forge--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--yes.
buffalo
forge.
once
you
prove
the
violation,
of
course
then
we
go
back
to
work.
this
policy
argument...
and
you
will
hear
policy
arguments
all
this
afternoon...
has
an
awful
reminiscent
ring.
peace
at
any
price.
but,
you
know,
how
far
do
you
go?
do
you
really
invade
the
province
of
congress
and
carve
out
an
exception
to
norris-laguardia,
because
that's
what
this
right
of
control
argument
that
occidental
urges
is
nothing
more
than
new
legislation,
isn't
it?
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i
say
a
suit
to
enforce
the
no
strike
clause
is
the
labor
dispute
par
excellence.
the
301
suit,
absolutely.
the
underlying
dispute
over
which
we
struck
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
but
the
point
is,
we
picked
the
quarrel
with
the
soviet
union;
then
along
comes
the
employer
and
picks
a
quarrel
with
us.
they
are
two
separate
and
distinct
disputes.
buffalo
forge
is
just
crystal
clear
on
that.
the
original
unarbitrable
dispute
generates
another
dispute
with
the
employer
where
he
says
hey,
your
action
over
the
non
arbitrable
is
violating
our
no
strike
clause.
and
just
a
word
more.
whether
you
call
it
no
strike
clause,
management
rights
clause,
work
assignment
clause,
you're
saying
the
same
thing.
we're
still
not
striking
over
that.
we're
striking
over
afghanistan.
so
now
they're
saying
your
striking
over
afghanistan
violates
our
right
to
assign
work
to
whom
we
want.
they
made
that
pitch
in
buffalo
forge
in
a
lower
court.
they
didn't
have
the
gall
to
bring
it
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
as
occidental
does,
but
it
was
a
pitch:
hey,
this
is
a
work
assignment
case,
a
routine
thing
that
is
arbitrated
every
day.
no,
it
is
not
that.
in
a
work
assignment
case
the
arbitrator
can
solve
the
problem.
the
particular
guy
who
doesn't
want
to
work
on
saturday
or
sunday,
when
he
gets
monday
he's
happy.
the
arbitrator
can
do
all
he
wants,
he's
not
going
to
make
the
union
happy.
the
soviet
union
is
still
in
afghanistan.
we
are
still
being
asked
to
be
vital
link.
maybe
just
a
little
nail
that
goes
into
the
horseshoe
and
the
whole
thing,
but
we
don't
want
to
participate
in
that.
it's
too
horrible
a
business,
as
we
don't
with
the
polish.
but
to
call
it
management
rights,
work
assignment
as
the
solicitor
general,
is
just
putting
another
label
on
it.
that's
not
what
we
are
striking
over.
we
are
striking
over
afghanistan.
any
other
result
is
not
an
underlying...
any
other
dispute
is
not
an
underlying
dispute.
it's
a
dispute
that
results
from
the
union's
action
once
taken,
not
something
that
the
union's
action
was
taken
because
of.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no.
you
don't
have
a
political
question
at
all.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
i
think
then
you're
getting
back
into
the
ordinary
mill
and
grist
of
labor
law.
i
don't
know
whether
it
violates
your
particular
contract
or
not.
it
would
depend
on
what
your
contract
says.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
not
arbitrable
under
the
contract
it
simply...
well,
i
mean
look,
that
refusal
to
handle
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
sympathy
strike
in
buffalo
forge,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean
that's
really
what
they
were
doing.
there
they
wouldn't
cross
a
picket
line,
here
they
won't
handle
the
goods.
but
both
is
out
of
sympathy
for
the
employees
in
the
other
thing.
and
yes,
i
think
that
buffalo
forge
would
apply,
and
that
there
could
be
no
pre
arbitration
injunctive
relief.
but
the
arbitrator
would
do--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no,
i
don't,
if
you
keep
in
mind
that
the
no
strike
pledge
was
given
only
because
we
could
get
relief
from
the
arbitrator.
if
we
could
get
management
to
sit
down
and
arbitrate
that,
and
the
arbitrator
could
say
to
them
hey,
look,
you
can't
deal
with
those
people
because
of
their
labor
policies.
if
there
was
some
chance
of
success
in
the
non
economic
forum,
then
we
would
say
yes,
go
ahead,
let's
arbitrate
it.
but
what
management
is
asking
here
is
hey,
you
can't
strike
and
you
can't
get
any
relief
from
arbitration;
you
know,
just
grin
and
bear
it.
