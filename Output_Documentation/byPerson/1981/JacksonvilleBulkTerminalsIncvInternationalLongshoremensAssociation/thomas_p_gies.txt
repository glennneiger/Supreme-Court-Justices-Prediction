mr.
thomas
p.
gies
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
propriety
of
an
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
pursuant
to
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
to
restrain
a
work
stoppage
in
violation
of
the
parties'
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
reason
for
this
work
stoppage...
the
union's
disapproval
of
occidental's
continuing
trade
with
the
soviet
union
after
the
invasion
of
afghanistan...
is
the
decisive
fact
in
this
case.
as
i
will
develop
this
afternoon,
it
is
the
motivation
for
this
work
stoppage
that
makes
this
injunction
fully
warranted
under
section
301,
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
submit
very
simply
to
this
court
that
norris-laguardia
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
the
admitted
objective
of
the
union's
work
stoppage
has
concededly
and
always
been
a
purely
political
motivation.
the
concern
over
the
invasion
of
afghanistan
is
not
even
remotely
related
to
the
union's
status
as
employees.
accordingly,
that
work
stoppage
is
totally
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
the
court
obviously
has
never
held
that
norris-laguardia
protects
purely
political
union
work
stoppages,
and
the
cases
construing
norris-laguardia,
we
submit,
are
clear.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
section
4
of
norris-laguardia,
your
honor,
forbids
federal
courts
to
enter
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
as
defined
elsewhere
in
that
statute;
and
the
labor
dispute
definition
is
defined
broadly
to
include
wages
and
terms
and
conditions
with
the
purpose
of
assisting
unions
in
organizing
employees,
and
in
engaging
in
collective
bargaining,
and
for
other
mutual
aid
or
protection.
and
i
submit
that
even
under
the
broadest
possible
reading
of
the
mutual
aid
and
protection
clause
that
it
is
clear
that
any
effort
by
a
union
in
order
to
be
protected
by
norris-laguardia
must
make
some
effort
at
improving
the
lot
of
the
employees
as
employees;
and
that
an
objective
that
is
purely
political
has
absolutely
no
bearing
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
indeed,
your
honor.
not
only
against
the
interests
of
the
employees,
but
the
record
is
clear
in
this
case
that
this
is
against
the
interests
of
the
united
states
foreign
policy.
and
that
provides
another
reason
why
the
protections
of
norris-laguardia
should
not
be
extended
to
a
case
of
this
kind.
in
short,
it
is
clear
under
section
301
that
unless
this
conduct
is
protected
by
norris-laguardia,
there
is
no
serious
obstacle
to
the
injunction
entered
by
the
district
court.
it
is
only
if
the
union
can
convince
this
court
to
take
what
we
submit
to
be
a
radical
step
in
extending
the
scope
of
norris-laguardia
that
there
is
any
case
here
at
all.
if
norris-laguardia
does
not
apply,
the
ordinary
equitable
principles
warranting
an
injunction
were
present
in
this
case,
and
the
injunction
properly
issued.
it
is
not
sufficient,
we
submit,
that
there
be
an
incidental
work
stoppage.
the
objective
of
the
union
is
the
determinative
factor
for
answering
the
question
of
whether
or
not
norris-laguardia
applies.
there
are
strong
policy
reasons
for
not
extending
norris-laguardia
to
cover
a
case
like
this.
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
eastex
case
and
elsewhere
that
there
are
definite
limits
to
protected
activity
that
unions
are
entitled
to
engage
in.
the
eastex
case,
of
course,
grew
out
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
significantly,
that
contains
the
same
definition
of
labor
dispute
as
does
norris-laguardia.
under
this
court's
decision
in
eastex,
recognizing
that
purely
political
conduct
is
not
protected
by
section
7,
we
think
that
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
conduct
would
not
be
protected
by
the
norris-laguardia
act.
a
second
aspect
of
policy
that
we
think
is
very
critical
here
is
the
national
labor
policy
favoring
industrial
peace.
the
major
objective
of
section
301,
at
least
one
of
those
objectives,
was
to
permit
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
containing
no
strike
pledges.
irrespective
of
the
motivation
for
the
work
stoppage,
we
submit
national
labor
policy
favors
industrial
peace
and
favors
enforcement
of
no
strike
provisions
in
collective
bargaining
agreements.
i've
already
referred
briefly
to
the
foreign
policy
interference
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
union
here
has
demonstrated
a
long
history
of
taking
what
the
first
circuit
in
the
allied
case
called
whimsical
political
activity.
it
is
very
likely
to
happen
again,
and
the
solicitor
general
has
agreed
with
our
position
that
the
union's
conduct
here
does
indeed
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
american
foreign
policy.
because
of
that
and
because
of
the
other
two
policy
reasons
already
articulated,
it
is
clear--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
frankly,
we
are
somewhat
unclear
as
to
the
source
of
the
government's
concern
in
that
regard.
they
articulate
only
that
section
203(1)
of
taft-hartley
governing
the
operation
of
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
might
somehow
be
impacted
by
a
decision
in
this
case
that
a
purely
political
strike
is
not
a
work
stoppage.
we
frankly
see
no
reason
why
the
fmcs
should
get
involved
in
trying
to
mediate
the
russian
invasion
of
afghanistan,
and
see
no
negative
impact,
more
important,
on
federal
labor
policy
if
the
definition
of
labor
dispute
were
clarified
to
exclude
purely
political
conduct.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
need
not
reach
buffalo
forge
and
that
it
would
have
no
impact
on
buffalo
forge,
if
the
court
takes
the
narrow
approach
here
and
holds
that
this
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
the
question
has
never
come
up
directly,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know.
i
rely
very
heavily
on
every
case
that
the
court
has
decided
under
norris-laguardia,
none
of
which
extend
the
protections
of
the
act
to
purely
political
conduct.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
to
reach
the
exception
of
norris-laguardia
unless
the
act
applies
in
the
first
instance.
and
that
is
our
position.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
if
we
lose
the
first
point,
your
honor,
then
obviously
the
court
must
face
again
the
difficult
question
of
when
does
a
labor
injunction
issue,
assuming
the
applicability
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
we
submit
here
again
that
buffalo
forge
is
easily
distinguishable
from
this
case,
and
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
extend
norris-laguardia
to
include
this
kind
of
dispute,
that
there
is
sound
reason
why
injunctive
relief
was
proper
under
boys
markets
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
there
are
two
principal
distinctions,
your
honor,
that
i
would
make
between
this
case
and
buffalo
forge.
the
first
and
most
important
is
that
this
conduct
is
not
statutorily
protected.
it
is
purely
political
conduct
and
not
protected
by
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
buffalo
forge,
on
the
other
hand,
involved
the
right
of
employees
to
refuse
to
cross
a
picket
line...
one
of
the
most
fundamental
of
union
rights,
very
clearly
protected
activity.
and
the
court
there
necessarily
had
to
grapple
with
the
competing
tensions
of
statutorily
protected
conduct
on
one
hand,
and
the
statutorily
protected
right
of
the
employer
to
enforce
this
no
strike
clause.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
objective
and
the
motivation
of
the
union's
conduct
is
still
relevant,
even
if
norris-laguardia
would
apply--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--it
distinguished
this
case
from
buffalo
forge
in
our
view,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
now,
the
second
reason
that
this
case
is
very
different
from
buffalo
forge
is
the
nature
of
the
work
stoppage
and
what
motivated
it
in
the
first
place.
buffalo
forge--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--the
conduct
of
the
striking
employees.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
and
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
it
was
waived.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
correct,
your
honor.
correct.
and
so
the
question
in
buffalo
forge
was
once
statutorily
protected,
was
it
then
waived
by
the
no
strike
clause
in
the
contract.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
we
submit
it's
not
protected
in
the
first
instance.
now,
the
second
distinction
i
think
goes
to
the
nature
of
the
work
stoppage.
the
union
refused
to
handle
soviet
cargo
in
this
case.
the
work
stoppage
grew
out
of
an
affirmative
act
of
the
employer
of
these
particular
employees;
that
is,
the
decision
to
continue
trading
in
soviet
cargo
after
the
invasion
of
afghanistan.
as
such,
this
work
stoppage
is
entirely
confined
within
this
employment
relationship.
buffalo
forge,
on
the
other
hand,
involved
a
sympathy
strike
in
support
of
other
employees,
not
within
that
collective
bargaining
relationship
that
the
employer
sought
to
force
through
an
injunction.
it's
understandable
in
that
kind
of
a
case
that
the
court
might
indeed
conclude
that
the
arbitrator
could
not
resolve
the
underlying
dispute,
because
the
underlying
dispute
was
the
complaint
of
another
group
of
employees
against
that
employer.
here,
there
is
no
other
group
of
employees.
here,
the
only
issue
between
the
employer
and
the
union
is
whether
or
not
we
can
force
these
employees
to
handle
russian
cargo.
now,
as
we
have
argued,
that
raises
a
very
distinct
question
of
arbitrability
under
the
contracts
management
rights
clause.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
indeed,
we
do.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
find
this
to
be
protected
by
norris-laguardia,
hat
the
solicitor
general
and
our
position
both
are
correct,
that
it
is
enjoinable
under
boys
markets.
it
is
an
underlying
arbitrable
dispute.
it's
a
shame
in
some
ways--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--yes.
the
only
difference
is
there's
some
indication
that
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
a
different
provision
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
than
do
we.
our
view
is
that's
not
a
major
difference.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
exactly,
exactly.
so
we
do
reach
the
same
point.
they
say
that--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--we
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
several
reasons,
your
honor,
the
first
of
which
is
that
we
think
it's
just
as
incumbent
upon
the
union
to
proceed
to
arbitration
in
a
case
like
this
as
it
is
for
us.
and
i
submit
that
the
reason
why
there's
been
no
arbitration
in
this
case
is
because
the
union
already
lost
that
issue
in
new
orleans
and
didn't
want
to
lose
it
again
here
in
jacksonville.
moreover,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
soon
after
this
injunction
was
issued,
the
presidential
embargo
was
extended
to
cover
the
product
at
issue
in
this
case;
and
practically
speaking,
at
that
point
there
wasn't
any
immediate
need
to
seek
arbitration.
we
have
remained
and
still
remain
willing
to
arbitrate
the
question
of
the
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause
at
any
time
and
always
have.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
the
arbitrable
dispute
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
union
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
handle
the
cargo,
not
just
the
question
of
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
you
mean
the
allied
case,
your
honor?
indeed
not.
it
depends,
i
think,
a
great
deal--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--it
would
depend
upon
the
theory
that
the
court
would
use
to
affirm
the
board.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
leaving
that
question
aside
for
a
minute--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--the
theory
of
the
court
below
in
the
first
circuit
would
permit
an
injunction
by
the
nlrb.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
not
as
well,
you
honor.
it's
much
more
effective
for
us
to
enforce
our
own
no
strike,
clause
ourselves
rather
than
have
to
rely
on
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
seek
a
10(1)
injunction.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
it
could
be
declared
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
it
was
in
the
first
circuit.
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
now,
we
would
submit,
though,
that
given
the
unusual
nature
of
the
allied
case...
and
there
are
different
theories
there
as
to
what
the
secondary
boycott
was
or
was
not...
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
find,
depending
upon
the
theory
used
by
the
court,
to
find
a
neutral
party
that
one
could
claim
was
being
coerced
so
that
secondary
boycott
relief
under
section
8(b)(4)
was
permissible.
but
that
question
aside,
justice
white,
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
correct.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court...
and
i
hope
the
court
does
affirm
the
allied
case...
that
it
makes
it
very,
very
clear
that
there
always
is
a
neutral
party
affected
by
this
kind
of
boycott,
and
that
8(b)(4)
ought
to
be
read
as
broadly
as
possible
to
keep
unions
from
engaging
in
this
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
indeed
not.
we
are
the
only
party
of
this
boycott
that's
been
affected
both
ways,
to
my
knowledge.
we
both
export
and
import.
the
problem
was
with
the
importation.
we
do
not
have
the
contract
with
the
longshoremen
union.
we
rely
on
stevedoring
companies
there
to
conduct
those
kinds
of
operations.
we
much
prefer
to
be
able
to
sue
on
our
own
contract
in
section
301
and
be
able
to
get
injunctive
relief.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
the
extension
of
the
embargo
in
1980
did
so.
president
reagan
lifted
that
embargo
this
year.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
so
we
are
once
again
shipping
both
ways,
both
exporting
and
importing.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
it
is
a
little
unclear,
frankly,
as
to
who
takes
the
first
step
in
initiating
the
grievance.
typically,
the
employee
and/or
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
process
the
grievance.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
that
would
be
an
independent
arbitrable
question,
and
whether
or
not--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
you
get
to
the
fact
that
if
the
only
arbitrable
question
is
the
interpretation
of
the
no
strike
clause,
you
cannot
distinguish
buffalo
forge.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
correct.
and
our
position
ultimately
would
be
even
if
this
court
finds
that
the
only
dispute
in
this
case
is
the
application
of
the
no
strike
clause,
that
a
pre
arbitration
injunction
is
still
proper.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
i
think
as
buffalo
forge
has
been
interpreted--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--there
have
been
cases
that
have
done
that
from
the
union's
perspective,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor,
of
course,
we
rely
on
buffalo
forge
to
defend
those
kinds
of
cases.
the
court
need
not
go
so
far
as
to
overrule
buffalo
forge.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
very,
very
important
policy--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
for
two
reasons:
one,
that
norris-laguardia--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
for
the
first
reason
that
we
don't
think
norris-laguardia
applies
in
the
first
instance.
and
for
the
second
reason,
even
if
it
does
that
under
boys
markets
a
pre
arbitration
injunction
was
fully
warranted
under
boys
markets.
but
even
if
the
court
finds,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
that
the
only
contractual
issue
here
is
the
no
strike
clause,
then
i
submit
that
there
are
differences,
again
based
on
the
motivation
of
the
union's
conduct,
that
would
not
require
overruling
buffalo
forge
but
would
permit
the
injunction
in
this
case.
and
that
reason
again
gets
back
to
the
motivation
of
the
union's
conduct.
the
motivation
here
is
purely
political.
there
is
no
competing
tension
between
two
aspects
of
national
labor
policy.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
intervening
case
law
and
interpretation
of
buffalo
forge
has
caused
the
confusion
that
it
has,
we
submit
that
that
provides
an
additional
reason
for
not
extending
buffalo
forge
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
there's
no
real
question
in
our
mind
that
the
availability
of
other
remedies
to
combat
a
work
stoppage
of
this
kind
has
been
curtailed.
the
availability
of
the
damages
remedy
has
been
cut
back
by
this
court's
decision
in
both
carbon
fuel
and
complete
auto
transit.
the
availability
of
a
discipline
remedy--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--we
haven't
gotten
that
far
in
the
case
yet,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
what
we
would
have
to
do
in
this
case
is
litigate
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
could
pursue
damages
against
the
local
and/or
the
international.
and
i--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--indeed
not.
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
union's
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court
was
they
were
not
a
party
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
so
the
union
has
not
only
denied
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause,
but
the
international
has
tried
to
contend
they're
not
even
a
party
to
the
case.
now,
of
course
they've
abandoned
that
argument
by
the
time
it's
gotten
here.
we
submit
that
damages,
not
only
is
it
questionable
under
the
court's
decisions,
whether
or
not
it's
efficacious.
it's
clear
to
me
that
pursuing
either
damages
or
discipline
of
employees
does
nothing
to
promote
industrial
harmony
and
does
everything
in
fact
to
exacerbate
industrial
strife,
which
we
submit
is
totally
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
national
labor
policy.
in
fact,
we
think
that
this
is
probably
the
most
ironic
kind
of
no
strike
clause
violation
that
the
court
could
ever
see.
in
the
typical
case
the
union
strikes
because
of
something
the
employer
does.
the
employer,
as
in
boys
markets,
assigns
supervisors
to
do
what
the
union
considers
to
be
bargaining
unit
work.
the
union
has
a
defense.
they
claim
that
the
company
has
violated
the
contract
warranting
them
to
strike.
in
this
case
if
you
believe
the
union,
the
employer
here
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
they
claim
their
dispute
is
solely
with
the
soviet
union.
and
if
you
believe
that
argument,
here
we
have
a
situation
where
an
employer
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
causing
the
breach
of
the
no
strike
clause
in
the
first
instance,
and
he
cannot
obtain
an
injunction,
whereas
if
he
had
done
something
to
precipitate
it
in
the
first
place,
he
could
obtain
an
injunction.
and
our
view
is
that
that
again
is
inconsistent
with
the
goals
of
national
labor
policy.
the
concern
about
buffalo
forge
to
the
effect
that
there
might
be
usurpation
of
the
arbitrator
in
the
event
that
a
pre
arbitration
injunction
were
issued
in
this
case
we
think
mischaracterizes
the
real
concern
of
what
federal
courts
do.
in
every
boys
markets
case
we
submit
a
federal
court
has
to
examine
two
questions.
the
court
must
look
first
to
see
whether
or
not
the
strike
does
indeed
violate
the
no
strike
clause,
because
if
the
no
strike
clause
excepts
from
its
prohibition
certain
kinds
of
conduct,
then
there
is
obviously
nothing
to
enjoin
in
the
first
instance.
secondly,
of
course,
the
court
in
a
boys
markets
situation
must
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
an
independent
underlying
dispute,
as
has
been
interpreted
in
buffalo
forge.
in
neither
situation
does
the
court's
initial
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
usurp
the
arbitrator.
it
is
merely
that
initial
determination
of
arbitrability
that
the
court
has
required
federal
courts
to
take
since
the
steelworkers
trilogy.
and
in
our
view,
allowing
a
pre
arbitration
injunction
in
this
case
would
in
no
way
either
cause
an
influx
of
cases
into
the
federal
courts
or
amount
to
a
usurpation
of
the
arbitration
function.
the
vice
with
the
way
the
lower
courts
have
interpreted
buffalo
forge
is,
very
frankly,
the
notion
of
coterminous
application
of
the
no
strike
clause
in
the
arbitration
provision.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
genesis
of
the
quid
pro
quo
coterminous
application
theory
was
this
court's
decisions
in
gateway
coal
and
lucas
flour.
both
of
those
cases
involved
implied,
not
express,
no
strike
clauses.
and
while
it
may
make
sense
there,
and
probably
does
make
sense
there,
to
imply
a
no
strike
clause
only
as
broad
as
the
arbitration
provision,
where
you
have
an
express
no
strike
clause
that
on
its
face
obligates
the
union
not
to
strike
for
any
reason
whatsoever,
that
is
beyond
arbitrable
questions,
that
it
is
imperative
that
the
court
analyze,
as
admonished
in
gateway
coal,
that
provision
separately
and
distinct
from
the
arbitration
provision.
here,
of
course,
in
this
case
the
arbitration
provision
is
also
very
broad.
it
is
not
limited
to
grievances
over
terms
and
conditions
of
the
contract,
but
it
covers
all
matters
under
dispute.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor,
in
new
orleans.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
our
view
is,
very
frankly,
that
there's
no
reason
why
we're
not
entitled
to
the
most
effective
remedy.
and
there's
no
reason,
in
our
view,
why
those
boats
should
have
sat
in
the
harbor
in
jacksonville
five
minutes.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
indeed
not.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
we
would
see
no
reason
to
change
that
policy
when
it
comes
up
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
we
don't
think
the
court
need
go
that
far.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
our
position
is
that
where
the
conduct
is
either
political,
and
therefore
not
entitled
to
statutory
protection,
or
where
it
is
beyond
the
employer's
control...
and
those
are
two
very
different
things...
that
in
both
those
situations
the
mere
allegation
of
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause
will
support
the
pre
arbitration--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--correct.
again,
assuming
all
the
other
requisites
of
boys
markets
have
been
met.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
that
is
our
first
argument,
your
honor.
we
agree.
i
will
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
just
briefly,
your
honor.
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
question
about
the
dogcatcher
and
the
blockbuster
issues,
mr.
mathews
ignores
the
fact
that
this
union
this
past
year
conducted
a
one
day
work
stoppage
over
the
death
of
the
irish
republican
army
prisoner
bobby
sands.
and
i
think
that
that
points
out
the
possibility
for
what
we've
called
random
whimsical
political
action
that
indeed
makes
this
a
very,
very
serious
problem.
second,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
our
view
is
that
the
existence
or
not
of
a
remedy
under
section
303
or
section
10(1)
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
should
have
no
impact
on
the
existence
of
a
remedy
under
section
301.
they
are
independent
points.
this
court's
decision
in
william
arnold
versus
the
carpenters
indicates
that
it's
a
separate
theory
that
we
are
entitled--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--assuming
norris-laguardia
applies
under
buffalo
forge,
no.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
and
the
answer
is
that
if
there
was
no...
if
the
union
was
not--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--and
both
boys
markets
and
buffalo
forge
would
require
that
the
dispute
be
arbitrable,
and
if
it
were
not
arbitrable,
then
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
an
injunction.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
response
to
justice
powell's
question,
it
is
very
conceivable
that
domestic
political
disputes
may
indeed
arise,
and
that
raises
the
point
of
who
has
control
over
the
situation.
if
a
union
strikes
to
protest
a
political
contribution
made
by
the
employer,
the
employer
in
theory
could
resolve
that
dispute
by
giving
the
money
to
some
other
candidate
more
in
the
interest
of
the
union.
that
to
me
would
be
something
that
is
even
less
a
problem
than
we
have
in
this
case;
because
here
again
if
you
believe
the
union,
the
employer
can
do
absolutely
nothing
about
the
underlying
cause
of
the
strike.
finally,
i
would
mention
one
point
that
is
showing
the
difficulty
that
the
lower
courts
have
had
applying
buffalo
forge.
we
could
easily
have
converted
this
work
stoppage
to
an
arbitrable
situation...
and
by
arbitrable
i
mean
a
pre
arbitration
injunction...
under
buffalo
forge
and
boys
market.
had
we
discharged
the
employees
and
the
question
then
became
whether
or
not
we
had
the
right
to
do
so,
that
would
clearly
raise
a
separate
arbitrable
question
as
the
courts
have
interpreted
buffalo
forge
and
boys
markets.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
shows
that
buffalo
forge
should
not
be
extended
to
apply
to
a
case
like
this.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
we
might
enjoin
the
strike--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--the
sixth
circuit
held
in
complete
auto
transit--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--that's
precisely
what
the
sixth
circuit
found
in
complete
auto
transit,
your
honor;
that
the
purpose
of
the
strike
was
transformed
from
a
non
arbitrable
reason
to
an
arbitrable
reason.
and
the
question
there
became
and
this
would
include
strikers.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
and
then
they
were
able
to
get
a
pre
arbitration
injunction.
to
permit
an
employer
to
do
that
i
submit
is
inconsistent
with
national
labor
policy
and
does
nothing
to
further
industrial
peace.
this
court
should
take
the
opportunity
to
reaffirm
the
validity
of
no
strike
clauses.
thank
you.
