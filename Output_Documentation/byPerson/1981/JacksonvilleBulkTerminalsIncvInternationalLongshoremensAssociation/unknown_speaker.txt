unknown
speaker
what's
the
language
of
norris-laguardia,
labor
disputes?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
could
reasonably
be
said
that
this
would
be
against
the
interests
of
the
employees
because
it
would
cut
down
their
work.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
the
government's
position
is
that
there
is
a
labor
dispute
here,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
injunction
with
justified
within
the
boys
market
exception?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
the
consequences
for
our
decision
in
buffalo
forge
if
we
were
to
follow
your
advice?
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
any
one
particular
case
from
this
court
as
holding
this
is
not
a
labor
dispute?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
lose
that
first
point,
then
what
about
justice
rehnquist's
question?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
distinguishing
features?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
this
is
on
the
assumption
that
norris-laguardia
applies.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
would
say
an
injunction
could
issue
whenever
you
find
that
something
falls
outside
of
section
7,
even
if
there's
a
labor
dispute.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
point
has
nothing
to
do
with
buffalo
forge
either.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
first
distinction.
you
say
the
conduct
of
whom
is
not
statutorily
protected?
unknown
speaker
because
this
is
a
right
to
strike...
because
their
motive
was
political.
i
see.
unknown
speaker
whereas
in
buffalo
forge
the
sympathy
strike
was
statutorily
protected.
unknown
speaker
that
was
about
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions.
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
agree
with
the
united
states
position
then.
unknown
speaker
that
there
really
is
an
underlying
arbitrable
dispute,
namely
the
breadth
of
the
management
rights
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
protected
by
norris-laguardia,
then
isn't
your
position
and
the
government's
the
same?
unknown
speaker
it
makes
it
an
arbitrable
dispute.
unknown
speaker
has
your
client
yet
gone
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reason
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
what
you
claim
is
the
arbitrable
dispute,
though,
for
purposes
of
distinguishing
boys
market.
unknown
speaker
if
the
judgment
in
the
other
case
is
affirmed
is
your
problem
solved?
unknown
speaker
there
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
enjoin
a
secondary
boycott.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
about
the
theory
of
the
court
below?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
would
that
solve
your
problem?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
be
declared
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
refusing
to
handle
cargo,
and
that
cargo
comes
from
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
some
neutral.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
there's
no
difference
which
way
the
cargo
is
moving,
in
or
out.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
did
you
say
that
the
extension
of
the
embargo
in
any
event
prevents
you
from
handling
this
cargo,
without
regard
to
the
activities
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
earlier
something
about
the
extension
of
the
embargo
barred
you
from
handling
this
stuff
anyway.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
i
misunderstood
you.
i
didn't
get
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gies,
let
me
go
back
for
a
moment.
you
and
the
government
have
a
little
different
theory
on
what
the
underlying
arbitrable
dispute
may
be.
taking
your
version,
under
your
version
who
would
initiate
the
arbitration
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
take
either
hypothesis.
say
your
view
is
that
then
you
might
initiate.
what
would
you
claim?
you
would
say
that
the
management
prerogative
clause
should
be
construed
to
allow
us
to
assign
work
involving
these
particular
shipments
to
you.
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
the
union
answers
that
we
agree.
there's
nothing
to
arbitrate
because
we
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
that
clause.
the
only
thing
we
disagree
with
you
about
is
your
reading
of
the
no
strike
clause.
would
you
still
say
that
buffalo
forge
is
distinguishable?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
interpretation
of
the
no
strike
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
how
do
you
distinguish
buffalo
forge?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
you
may
issue
an
injunction
pending
the
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
say
that
in
connection
with
any
violation
of
any
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
could
you
enter
a
pre
arbitration
injunction
over
an
allegedly
illegal
firing?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
not
consistent
with
norris-laguardia,
would
you
suggest?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
i
was
on
the
other
side
of
buffalo
forge,
as
you
know,
but
i'd
be
interested,
why
not?
why
wouldn't
we
have
to?
unknown
speaker
it's
been
cut
back,
but
how
does
it
affect
the
damage
remedy
against
this
particular
union?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
certainly
not
being
able
to
collect
from
the
employees,
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
that
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
they
both
accept
responsibility
for
the
stoppage,
as
i
understand
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
below
would
have
said
there
could
be
no
injunction
issued
issue
if
the
arbitrator
determines
that
the
no
strike
clause
has
been
violated
and
says
so,
and
then
the
union
continues
to
strike?
can't
you
enforce
the
arbitration
provision?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
an
injunction
pending
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
but
you
normally
don't
have
an
injunction
pending
arbitration.
you
certainly
do
afterwards.
in
most
claims
of
violation
of
301
that
are
arbitrable
you
have
an
arbitration,
but
you
don't
join
the
employer
from
firing.
unknown
speaker
he
fires
and
then
reinstatement
awaits
the
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
would
in...
when
the
promise
is
not
to
strike,
do
you
say
you
may
have
an
injunction
any
time
that
it's
alleged
that
the
no
strike
clause
has
been
violated?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
your
position?
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
making
out
the
normal
grounds
for
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
dispute
is
political
and
not
with
the
employer,
that
seems
to
me
is
a
stronger
reason
for
saying
it's
not
a
labor
dispute
than
it
is
for
getting
an
exception
to
an
exception.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
this
be
any
different
if,
for
example,
on
the
west
coast
or
anywhere
you
had
the
union
refusing
to
handle
airplanes
to
taiwan,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
one
less
or
different
in
some
way
in
a
political
sense?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
any
different
from
the
shock
that
came
from
what's
happened
in
poland?
unknown
speaker
but
the
afghanistan
was
political.
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
argument
about
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
belabor
it
with
me,
because
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
get
it
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
what
statutory
language
do
you
think
covers
this
dispute
in
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act?
unknown
speaker
and
then
they
define
labor
dispute
in
another
section
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
they
don't--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
make
this
argument
without
reference
to
the
statutory
language
is
all
i'm
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
the
definition
of
a
labor
dispute
in
the
norris-laguardia--
unknown
speaker
--what
has
this
got
to
do...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
terms
or
conditions
of
employment,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
no
strike
clause.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
promise
to
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
that
different
from
any
time
that
you
have
a
refusal
to
work,
a
strike,
whatever
the
motivation
may
be;
it's
always
a
refusal
to
furnish
labor,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
render
the
language
of
norris-laguardia
simply
meaningless?
unknown
speaker
as
well
as
the
arbitration
clause
becomes
meaningless,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
there
were
no
no
strike
clause
in
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
but...
well,
there
may
not
have
been
an
obstacle
to
their
suing
unless
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies.
that's
my
point.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be.
would
there,
in
your
judgment,
be
a
labor
dispute
between
the
parties
here
if
there
were
no
no
strike
clause
in
the
contract,
or
does
your
labor
dispute
depend
entirely
on
the
fact
that
it
involves
that
term
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
no.
say
they
don't
sue
you
under
a
contract;
they
merely
sue
you
under
some
kind
of
common
law
tort
theory
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
would
the
norris-laguardia
act
be
an
objection
to
the
entering
of
an
injunction
in
such
a
case?
unknown
speaker
so
the
labor
dispute,
in
your
view,
turns
entirely
on
the
presence
of
a
no
strike
clause
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
the
strike
but
rather
it's
the
fact
that
it's
a
contract
case.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
not
the
government's
theory.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
this
is
a
labor
dispute
that
is
not
arbitrable?
unknown
speaker
exception
for
arbitration
clause.
unknown
speaker
the
arbitration
point
is
not
about
afghanistan;
it's
whether
or
not
you
can
strike.
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
said
it
was
about
afghanistan.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
should
think
so.
but
it
can
be
arbitrated
as
to
whether
a
man
works
or
not,
or
whether
a
man
follows
his
contract
or
not,
or
whether
he
commits
a
tort
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
arbitrate
whatever's
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
but
you
weren't
interested.
unknown
speaker
you
weren't
interested
in
arbitration.
are
you
interested
now?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
talking
about
arbitration.
you're
not
interested
in
arbitration
now,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mathews,
on
the
quid
pro
quo
point,
do
you
suppose
that
lawyers
could
possibly
draft
in
the
next
negotiation
an
agreement
by
which
the
union
would
be
bound
not
to
strike
in
a
situation
like
this?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
not
be
enforceable.
unknown
speaker
could
you
draft
an...
i
should
have
said...
obviously
you
could
draft
it.
could
you
draft
an
enforceable
no
strike
clause
that
would
cover
something,
some
dispute
that
was
not
arbitrable
such
as
this
particular
dispute
with
russia?
i
guess
the
answer
is
no.
well,
you
don't
say
this
no
strike
clause
isn't
enforceable.
unknown
speaker
you
just
say
you
can't
issue
an
injunction
pending
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
and
as
soon
as
it's
arbitrated
and
decided
that
you've
violated
it,
you're
going
to
have
to
stop.
unknown
speaker
let
me
make
my
question
more
clear.
justice
white
is
absolutely
right,
of
course.
but
could
you
draft
a
clause
that
would
be
judicially
enforceable
by
injunction?
after
the--
--now
we
know
what
the
problem
is,
and
the
management
comes
to
you
and
says
we
don't
want
this
to
happen
again.
and
you
say
it's
all
right,
if
you
give
us
an
extra
dollar
an
hour,
why,
we'll
agree,
we
will
not
strike
in
this
precise
situation
pending
arbitration.
i
guess
you're
going
to
say
that
there's
no
way
that
you
can
make
such
a
provision
to
be
judicially
enforceable,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
inconceivable
that
management
would
be
interested
in
such
a
clause.
unknown
speaker
and
that
they
might
be
able
to
offer
you
enough
economic
incentive
so
that
you
might
find
it
attractive;
but
it's
something
the
law
just
doesn't
provide
for,
i
guess.
but
if
it's
a
norris-laguardia
jurisdictional
and
the
parties
don't
waive,
you
can't
create
jurisdiction,
i
guess,
to
issue
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
you
could
say
well,
we
waive
the
protections
of
norris-laguardia.
unknown
speaker
in
effect
in
your
contract.
but
would
that
give
the
court
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
really
jurisdictional,
the
parties
can't
create
it
by
waiver.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mathews,
would
you
have
a
different
situation
if
the
union
concluded
that
it
did
not
approve
of
the
politics
of
the
management
of
the
employer?
let's
say
you
have
a
political
campaign
going
on,
and
the
president
of
the
company
makes
a
contribution
that
the
union
disagrees
with.
the
union
goes
out.
you
have
a
precisely
comparable
situation,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference?
what
is
the
difference
between
one
political
strike
and
another
one?
unknown
speaker
is
it
limited
to
foreign
policy?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
would
give
you
view.
unknown
speaker
but
the
legal
arguments--
unknown
speaker
--but
your
legal
arguments
are
precisely
the
same
as
in
justice
powell's
case,
it
seems
to
me.
aren't
your
legal
arguments
precisely
applicable
to
justice
powell's
hypothetical?
it's
a
labor
dispute
because
it's
a
strike,
you've
got
a
no
strike
clause,
and
it's
over
a
non
arbitrable
dispute.
that's
the
whole
ballgame,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
only
significance
of
the
word
"political"
is
that
it's
non
labor.
unknown
speaker
non-arbitrable,
rather.
it's
broader
than
this.
it's
non
arbitrable.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
well,
you
could
always
obtain
the
same
result
of
buffalo
forge
by
drafting
the
kind
of
a
clause
that
you've
been
working
so
hard
at
drafting.
unknown
speaker
we
promise
not
to
strike
if
the
dispute
involved
is
arbitrable.
unknown
speaker
but
arbitration
clauses
have
gotten
broader
and
broader,
too,
haven't
they?
unknown
speaker
they're
no
longer
confined
just
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
contract.
a
lot
of
them
are
any
and
all
disputes
between
employers
and
employees.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
depends
on
how
you
put
the
question,
doesn't
it?
if
the
question
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
for
the
strike,
why
isn't
that
subject
to
arbitration,
in
a
legal
basis?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
resolved
if
the
arbitrator
came
out
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you're
suggesting
really
is
that
if
it's
an
arbitration
that
you
aren't
sure
to
win,
then
it's--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
then
you
come
down
to
the
question
can
you
stop
working
on
that
kind
of
an
issue
under
the
contract
and
the
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
arbitrator
said
you're
violating
your
no
strike
clause,
you
can
be
stopped
then
from
striking.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
employer
can
if
you
don't
stop,
can
enforce
the
arbitration
in
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
rationale
of
the
new
orleans
arbitrator
in
response
to
your
argument
that
the
dispute
with
russia
is
something
he
can't
resolve?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
what
he
arbitrated.
he
arbitrated
on
whether
you
violated
your
no
strike
clause.
unknown
speaker
but
you
must
have
argued
to
him
that
the
scope
of
the
no
strike
clause
was
limited
to
arbitrable
disputes.
you
must
have
argued
that.
and
what
did
he
say?
i
know
you
didn't,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
must
have
been
the
submission
of
the
arbitrator,
that
the
no
strike
clause
was
no
broader
than
the
arbitration
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
the
submission,
its
holding
was
that
the
no
strike
clause--
unknown
speaker
--well,
all
of
us
who
have
dealt
with
injunctions
realize
that
the
rule
is
once
you
get
a
preliminary
injunction,
you
take
off
for
the
faraway
places.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
recognize
that.
unknown
speaker
but
i
still...
i
can't
see
whether
you've
answered
justice
powell
yet,
i'm
sorry
to
say.
i
was
worried
about
the
same
thing.
i
mean,
the
union
for
any
political
reason
can
strike.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
any
political
strike.
unknown
speaker
yes.
because
it
makes--
unknown
speaker
--a
union
can
strike
because
the
dogcatcher
who
was
just
elected
wasn't
a
fit
person
to
hold
public
office?
unknown
speaker
they
could
tie
up
the
port
of
new
york.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
and
they
can
get
relief
under
norris-laguardia.
unknown
speaker
they're
protected
by
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
can
expand
that
to
egypt
and
israel
and
taiwan
and
countless
other
political
issues,
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
is
there
a
public
policy
aspect
to
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
until
a
violation
of
a
contract
has
been
proven.
unknown
speaker
to
make
your
point
you
have
to
start
with
a
premise
whether
this
is
or
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
i
thought
you
conceded
this
was
not
a
labor
dispute.
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
were
involving
shipments
to
someone
in
hawaii,
parts
to
a
big
plant
that
is
non
union;
in
fact,
the
big
plant
in
hawaii
is
affirmatively
anti
union.
and
you
say
you're
not
going
to
handle
anything
that's
going
to
help
this
non
union,
anti
union
company
in
hawaii.
now,
you
haven't
got
quite
a
political
question
there,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
would
you
refuse
to
handle
that
goods?
unknown
speaker
let's
say
it's
the
same
contract
you've
got
here.
the
effect
of
it
is
the
union's
trying
to
impose
its
view
of
a
particular
problem
on
the
employer
with
whom
it
has
contracted
to
refrain
from
striking.
unknown
speaker
you're
taking
a
good
deal
of
the
quid
away
from
the
idea
of
having
no
strike
contracts.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
were
not
an
arbitration
clause
in
this
contract
could
you
enforce
the...
could
you
get
an
injunction
pending
outcome
of
a
301
suit?
unknown
speaker
not
under
buffalo
forge.
i
said
assuming
on
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
that
there
was
a
no
strike
clause
but
no
arbitration
clause.
unknown
speaker
so
just
the
fact
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause
wouldn't
give
you
the
right
to
a
pre
suit
injunction.
unknown
speaker
but
you
couldn't
enjoin
the
strike.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
be
enjoining
the
strike
then.
you
would
have...
what
would
you
do?
unknown
speaker
the
strike
wouldn't
be
over
firing
the
employees.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
could
get
an
injunction.
