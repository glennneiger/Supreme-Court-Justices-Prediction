unknown
speaker
your
submission
is
that
the
dissemination
prohibition
is
essential
to
supplement
the
production
prohibition,
which
you
say
you
can
validly
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you...
then
how
do
you...
i
am
sure
you
will
get
to
this
sooner
or
later
and
you
may
do
it
in
your
own
course
if
you
want
to,
but
how
do
you
explain
then
your
prohibition
of
distribution
on
production
that
has
taken
place
outside
the
state?
that
certainly
is
not
as
a
supplement
to
any
kind
of
production
that
you
are
legally
authorized
to
prohibit.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it's
quite
possible.
suppose
in
a
particular
case
everybody
concedes
the
production
took
place
in
california.
then
what's
your--
unknown
speaker
--more
pressure,
more
invitation
to
secret
production
in
new
york.
more
likely
that--
unknown
speaker
--twelve
hours
on
both
counts?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
here
where
the
film
was
made?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
proof
in
this
case
about
that,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
were
surprised
at
the
verdict.
unknown
speaker
you
were
not
surprised
at
the
acquittal
on
the
one
count
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
can't
that
also
be
explained
under
the
ancient
proposition
of
inconsistent
verdicts,
which
the
system
has
found
tolerable?
we
have
never
expected
consistent
verdicts,
necessarily,
from
the--
unknown
speaker
--one
explanation
could
be
for
some
people,
but
inconsistent
verdicts
are
part
of
the
system.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
is
it
correct
that
there
were
two
films
and
as
to
each
film
there
was
a
charge
both
on
the
obscene
section
of
the
statute,
and
also
on
the
non-obscene
statute.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
kind
of
like
a
lesser
included
defense.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
found
him
guilty
on
all
four
counts?
could
that
verdict
have
stood?
unknown
speaker
that
the
film
had
been
both
obscene
and
not
obscene?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
of
the
statute?
supposing
the
films
had
been
obscene.
your
view
is
that
they
could
be
convicted
under
all
four
counts?
it
seems
to
me
there's
kind
of
a
double
punishment
problem
there,--
unknown
speaker
--there's
nothing
about
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
is
before
us
that
requires
non-obscenity
as
an
element,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
violate
this
particular
statute
even
if
the
movies
were
obscene.
unknown
speaker
if
you
used
children
in
producing
an
obscene
movie,
do
you
violate
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
you
could.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pitler,
can
i
interrupt
you
there?
at
page
3a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement...
or
i
guess
it
is
the
cert
petition
rather...
there's
a
paragraph
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
describes
what
it
says
the
statute
covers.
and
one
of
the
things
it
says
it
covers
is
just
what
you
have
described.
it
says,
"it
would
also
prohibit
the
sale,
showing
or
distributing
of
medical
or
educational
materials
containing
photographs
of
such--
"
unknown
speaker
--haven't
they
construed
their
own
statute?
unknown
speaker
well
maybe
they
were
careless
and
didn't
look
at
the
word
"lewd"
as
carefully
as
they
should
have.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
paragraph
tells
us
what
they
think
the
statute
prohibits.
and
maybe
that's
crazy
for
them
to
read
it
that
way,
but
can
we
reread
a
new
york
statute
differently?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
clearly
did
not
focus
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
"lewd",
i
agree
with
you
completely.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
if
the
argument
was
made
to
them
at
the
time
of
that
appeal,
what
the
word
"lewd"
meant
or
how--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
the
point
is
fatal
to
your
case,
mr.
pitler?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
point
is
fatal
to
your
case,
is
critical
to
your
case?
suppose
the
court
meant
exactly
what
it
said.
what
would
your
response
be?
would
you
say
that
you
cannot
forbid...
would
you
agree,
or
would
you
say
that
the
state
can
forbid
the
use
of
children
in
non-lewd
photographs
displaying
the
genitals?
unknown
speaker
could
not
do
that.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
would
say
but
the
only
reason
the
statute
would
be
invalid
then
is
because
it
was
over-broad.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it
would
substantially
over-broad,
if
that's
all
it...
if
that
was
the
only
degree
of
its
over-breadth;
that
it
just
happened
to
ban
medical
treatises?
unknown
speaker
these
people
certainly
weren't
publishing
medical
treatises,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
not
regard
the
frieze
in
this
building,
that
one,
with
its
display
of
nudity,
both
sides,
as
not
being
offense
to
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
children
on
both
ends
of
that
one
up
there.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
about
the
validity
of
that
law?
the
felony
to
use
a
child
in
making
a
non-obscene
movie.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
what
case
supports
that
in
this
court,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
concede
that
the
state
may
make
a
felony
out
of
producing
a
non-obscene
movie.
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
asked
you
a
simple
question...
making
a
non-obscene
movie.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
may
they
make
it
a
felony
to
use
a
child
in
producing
any
non-obscene
movie
that
you
can
think
of?
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
could.
i
thought
you
conceded
in
the
first
place
that
they
could
make--
unknown
speaker
--i
know,
but
there's...
i
suppose
there's
a
lot
of
things
that
might
be
sexually
stimulating
that
aren't
obscene.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
may
a
state
forbid
using
children
in
sexually-oriented
movies
that
aren't
obscene?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
to
argue
about
this
distribution
business.
you
just
say
that
the
law
against
production
is
bad,
and
a
fortiori
the
distribution
is
bad.
unknown
speaker
well,
legislatures
don't
have
to
make
a
finding,
though.
this
was
sufficient
for
the
new
york
legislature,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
passed
it,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
new
york
legislature
didn't
take
your
judgment
on
that
point,
it
passed
both
statutes,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
did
it
or
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
a
question?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
it
either
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
they
have
a
fullback.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
from
your
adversary's
comment
that
since
he
says
that
non-obscenity
is
not
a
requirement
for
this
section
before
us
now,
that
they
aren't
duplicative.
unknown
speaker
so
you
regard
this
as
kind
of
a
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
could
a
state
legislature
make
it
unlawful,
make
it
a
criminal
act
for
an
adult
to
arrange
for
or
induce
children
aged
7,
8,
9,
to
engage
in
these
acts?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
they
have
done
here?
unknown
speaker
in
essence,
isn't
that
what
they
have
done?
then
they
have
added
to
that
the
filming
of
it,
which
simply
compounds
the
situation.
but
the
conduct
you
admit
could
be
made
a
criminal
act.
unknown
speaker
can
you
add
one...
non-obscene
conduct?
does
a
state
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
prohibiting
non-obscene
conduct
by
children?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
could
they
then
prohibit
the
filming
of
it?
unknown
speaker
non-obscene.
unknown
speaker
so
now
you
agree
that
the
state
may
prohibit
the
production
of
non-obscene
films
in
which
children
are
the
actors.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
let's
suppose
the
legislature
found
it.
then
you
would
accept
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fahringer,
would
you
concede
that
not
only
is
the
legislative
interest
legitimate,
but
it
is
compelling
in
the
area
of
child
pornography?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
most
compelling
interest
that
one
could
imagine
for
a
legislative
act?
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
the
legislative
view,
obviously,
or
they
wouldn't
have
passed
this
additional
statute
which
obviously
the
legislature
determined
was
essential
to
get
at
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
your
position
that
it's
very
easy
for
the
state
to
uncover
where
these
films
are
made
and
to
put
a
stop
to
it?
unknown
speaker
well
presumably,
the
promoter
or
distributor
is
well
able
to
know
what's
in
the
film.
it
isn't
as
though
they're
innocent
of
knowledge
of
what's
contained
in
what
they're
selling.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
that
book?
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say
or
imply
that
you
need
some
experts
of
some
kind
to
indicate
that
the
conduct
involved
here
is
damaging,
injurious
to
young
children?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
members
of
the
legislature
need
someone
else
to
tell
them
that
this
is
damaging
to
children?
unknown
speaker
let's
take
a
7
or
8
or
9,
because
that's
what
you've
got
here.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
this
material
is
beneficial,
educational
material
for
children?
unknown
speaker
do
you
seriously
advance
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
offend
me
and
i
don't
mind
if
i
do
offend
you
on
this
point.
unknown
speaker
what
if
new
york
simply
passed
a
law,
akin
to
its
child
labor
law,
saying
that
no
child
shall
appear
in
a
moving
picture
who
is
under
the
age
of
16?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
give
me
an
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
it's
answerable
i
think
yes
or
no.
i
asked
whether
or
not
if
new
york
should,
analogously
to
its
child
labor
laws,
pass
a
statute
that
said
no
child
under
16
shall
appear
in
a
motion
picture,
just
like
no
children
under
16
are
allowed
to
work
most
other
places.
would
that
be
violative
of
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
be?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
state
can
prohibit
working
children
under
16
and
any
other
area,
but
it
can't
prohibit
them
from
working
in
films?
unknown
speaker
including
in
films.
unknown
speaker
no
first
amendment
problem?
unknown
speaker
the
state
is
arguing
i
think
in
part
that
the
injury
that
is
being
prohibited
or
avoided
by
this
particular
statute
is
the
constant
distribution
for
others
to
see
the
recorded
pictures
or
films
of
these
children
in
sexual
conduct,
and
that
it's
the
subsequent
exhibition
and
display
to
other
people
that
adds
further
harm
to
the
children.
that
there
is
harm
above
and
beyond
merely
the
initial
taking
of
the
photograph
in
the
constant
viewing
by
others
and
the
subsequent
psychological
damage
to
the
children
as
these
acts
are
reproduced
and
shown
to
others.
now,
does
the
state
have
no
substantial
interest
in
addressing
those
problems?
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
we,
instead
of
concentrating
on
other
people's
books
and
pictures,
concentrate
on
your
client's
pictures
and
books
for
a
moment.
do
you
think
that
your
suggestion
that
the
obscenity
statute
was
more
than
adequate
to
cover
this
type
of
abuse
would
be
agreed
to
by
the
person
who
prosecuted
this--
unknown
speaker
--i'd
like
to
finish
my
question
if
you'd
allow
me
to.
there
was
a
conviction
on
the
section
of
the
statutes
before
us,
but
an
acquittal
on
the
obscenity
count.
and
i
take
it
if
there
had
been
just
the
obscenity
statute
in
effect,
it
would
have
been
an
acquittal
on
the
only
count
that
was
brought.
unknown
speaker
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
injuries
to
the
children,
which
is
the
focus
of
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
new
about
having
three
statutes
that
you
could
use
alternatively
to
prosecute
particular
conduct?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fahringer,
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second.
you've
given
the
example
of
the
book,
show
me,
two
or
three
different
times.
would
that
book
have
been
lewd
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
did
the
question
of
what
lewd
means...
was
that
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
argument?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
argued?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
book
like
that
could
be
argued...
could
be
subject
of
argument.
unknown
speaker
the
chilling
effect
doesn't
have
anything
on
your
clients
because
they
don't
even
let
you
know
where
they
made
them.
they
don't
even
want
you
to
know
who
did
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
true,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
on
this
film
that
shows
who
produced
it,
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
you
made
an
offer
to
prove
anything
that
you
wanted
to
prove,
but
that
wouldn't
have
proved
it.
unknown
speaker
could
the
new
york
constitution
provide
by
statute
that
every
film
must
have
the
name
of
every
actor
and
participant,
every
producer,
every
cameraman
and
the
locations?
unknown
speaker
in
the
new
york--
unknown
speaker
--under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
does
that
add
weight,
then,
to
the
state's
argument
that
this
kind
of
a
statute
is
necessary
under
those
circumstances
to
reach
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
but
they
obviously
wanted
to
go
further
and
prosecute
some
who
were
not
child
pornographers
but
who
violated
this
third
portion
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
the
evil
they
were
striking
at
was
broader
than
the
child
pornography
in
the
sense
of
the
constitutionally
obscene.
unknown
speaker
except
in
the
one
case
in
which
you've
just
successfully
or
partially
successfully
tried,
where
they
found
it
not
obscene
but
convicted
him
under
this
statute.
now
you
have
a
reason
you
say
that
happened,
but
nonetheless,
that
is
what
happened.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you
mentioned
scrutinize
with
great
care.
your
brief,
as
i
understand
it,
agrees
that
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
this
area.
did
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
agree
that
the
state
has
an
interest
of
that
level
of
scrutiny?
unknown
speaker
would
you
indicate
where
it
said
so?
unknown
speaker
in
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
was
stated
expressly?
unknown
speaker
how
can
we
tell
what
standard
it
applied,
if
it
didn't
say
so?
unknown
speaker
but
the
only
interest
that
i
recall
the
court
of
appeals
having
identified
is
a
legitimate
interest,
which
is
far
short
of
the
compelling
interest
standard.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
the
first
amendment
argument,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
it
is?
it's
the
due
process
or
an
equal
protection
argument.
it's
not
a
first
amendment
argument.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
content-oriented
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
about
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fahringer,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
i
take
it
this
statute
has
no
civil
sanctions
or
remedies
of
any
kind
for
this
kind
of
material.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
constitution
would
tolerate
some
kind
of
civil
control
of
this
sort
of
material,
the
distribution
of
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pitler,
how
can
we
intelligently
decide
the
extent
that
this
market
really
exists,
as
a
court?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
can
we
really
rely
on
that?
unknown
speaker
how
do
i
know
that?
i
mean,
if
i
were
a
congressman
i
could
find
it
out,
but--
unknown
speaker
--did
they
find
the
volume
of
the
business
and
so
forth?
or
did
they
just
pass
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
your
argument
is
that
these
other
statutory
provisions
are
not
an
adequate
solution
to
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
and
those
comments
were
made
before
these
other
statutory
provisions
were
passed.
i
mean,
how
do
we
know
how
much
of
the
job
would
have
been
accomplished
by
the
prohibition
against
the
obscene
materials
and
the
prohibition
against
the
non-obscene
performances?
we
really
don't,
do
we?
you
may
be
dead
right,
but
i
just
don't
know
how
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
don't
know.
when
was
the
statute
passed?
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
it's
five
years.
and
has
there
been
any
change
in
the
amount
of
the
market
during
the
five
years?
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
and
we
know
it's
because
of
the
provision
in
dispute
here,
or
because
of
the
other
two
provisions?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
i
noticed
in
your
reply
brief
you
indicated
that
most
of
the
horrible
examples
that
the
amici
and
so
forth
describe
in
their
briefs
really
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
statute.
but
what
about
the
category
the
show
me
book
falls
in?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
it?
could
a
prosecutor
in
a
small
community
in
new
york
successfully
prosecute
a
book
seller
for
selling
that
book?
maybe
you
would
not
do
it
in
manhattan.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
could
be
used
as
an
example
of
a
category
of
educational
materials.
unknown
speaker
that
case
is
not
before
us.
