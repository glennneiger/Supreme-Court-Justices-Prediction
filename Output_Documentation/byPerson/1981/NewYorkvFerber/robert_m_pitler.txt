mr.
robert
m.
pitler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
new
york
can
make
it
a
crime
to
disseminate
materials,
for
example,
a
movie,
which
show
a
12-year
old
child
actually
having
sex
with
an
animal
or
an
adult
without
requiring
that
the
entire
movie
be
obscene.
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
legislation
is,
of
course,
to
protect
children
from
sexual
abuse.
this
purpose
distinguishes
this
case
and
new
york
penal
law
section
263.15
from
the
obscenity
cases
and
statutes
which
have
previously
come
before
this
court.
in
the
previous
cases,
in
the
obscenity
cases,
the
interests
of
the
state
are
generally
to
protect
the
viewer,
not
to
protect
the
people
who
participated
in
the
film.
that
much
is
made
clear
by
the
opinion
for
the
court
by
chief
justice
in
the
paris
adult
theater
case.
in
that
case
three
state
interests
were
mentioned
in
support
of
general
obscenity
legislation,
and
all
of
those
interests,
without
going
into
them,
are
aimed
at
protecting
the
viewer
or
the
community
from
seeing
the
film.
indeed,
the
obscenity
standard
itself
is
designed,
in
talking
of
terms
of
community
standards,
appeal
to
the
prurient
interests,
the
standard
itself
is
designed
to
protect
the
viewer.
here,
the
statute
in
question
is
not
at
all
designed
to
protect
the
viewer.
you
know,
one
can
say,
pardon
the
expression,
in
terms
of
obscenity
legislation
to
some
extent
you
deal
with
a
victimless
crime.
this
statute
and
the
concern
here,
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
victimless
crime.
we
are
dealing
with
a
crime
against
a
child
who
is
made
to
perform
any
and
every
kind
of
sexual
conduct
by
an
adult.
and
that
child
is
made
to
do
so
generally,
i
would
think,
involuntarily.
he
is
cast
in
a
role
which
will
have
a
profound
adverse
effect
upon
him,
and
that
adverse
effect
is
both
physical
and
mental.
and
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
what
we
have
set
forth
in
appendix
b
to
our
brief
about
all
the
damage
that
is
done
to
children.
and
the
harm
to
children
is
not
limited
to
the
production
process
itself.
the
child's
privacy
when
he
is
made
to
appear
in
that
film
is
forever
invaded.
he
knows
in
his
mind
that
he
is
on
that
film
and
that
film
is
being
disseminated
all
throughout
the
united
states.
the
embarrassment
caused
to
him,
the
emotional
and
psychic
trauma
to
him
is
quite
grave.
now,
our
adversaries
recognize
that
the
state
interest
here
is
compelling
at
least
with
respect
to
the
production
part
of
the
statute,
in
prohibiting
people
from
using
children
in
production
of
the
materials.
there
is
no
challenge
to
that
part
of
the
statute.
but
once
the
production
is
completed
and
the
sexual
abuse,
as
we
call
it
and
i
think
properly
so,
is
memorialized
on
film,
our
adversaries
say
the
first
amendment
then
comes
into
play
and
you
may
not
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
that
material
even
though
it
was
committed
by
committing
a
crime
against
a
child.
they
say
this
is
especially
so,
because
there
are
less
restrictive
ways
to
deal
with
the
problem
than
an
outright
ban
on
dissemination.
they
point
to
two.
one
less
restrictive
way
they
think
of
dealing
with
the
problem
involved
here
is
the
production
statute
itself.
it
is
good
enough
just
to
ban
the
use
of
children.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
an
effective
alternative
to
the
dissemination
statute.
and
the
reason
it
is
not
an
effective
alternative,
the
dissemination
statute,
is
because
most
of
the
production
is
done
secretly.
they
cannot
be
found
out.
the
producers
are
very,
very
difficult
to
infiltrate,
very
difficult
to
find.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes.
in
effect,
it
is
part
of
a
statutory
scheme
which
is
designed
to
protect
children,
and
you
cannot
protect
children
just
by
the
production
statute.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well,
one
of
the
problems
is
that
you
cannot
determine
where
the
production
takes
place
in
a
lot
of
these
films.
it's
impossible.
they
don't
say...
they
don't
have
a
list
of
credit--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--we
would
say
that
those
films,
in
effect,
would
feed
a
market
that
would
make
it
likely
that
children
in
new
york
would
be
used
to
make
other
films.
basically,
it's
a
kind
of
market
analysis.
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
where
the
film
is
made.
it
feeds
a
market.
people
want
to
buy
the
films,
there's
a
desire
for
more
films,
and
then
children,
regardless
of
where
they
live,
in
effect,
will
be
made
to
appear
in
these
films.
and
therefore,
it
would
serve
that
purpose
as
well.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
or
taking
the
new
york
children
elsewhere
to
make
films,
as
well.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
only
way
that
you
can
get
at
the
use
of
children
is
to
ban
the
dissemination.
it's
really
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
so
in
effect,
the
distributors
provide
the
economic
incentive
for
making
these
films.
and
this
is
something
that's
recognized
in
testimony
before
the
congress
and
from
rather
diverse
sources.
from
charles
rembar
to
the
l.a.
police
department,
from
professor
tribe
of
harvard
to
a
senior
editor
of
playboy
magazine,
everyone
recognizes
the
best
way,
the
most
effective
way
and
the
most
realistic
way
to
get
at
the
abuse
of
children
in
the
production
is
to
ban
the
dissemination.
the
second
alternative
to
the
dissemination
ban
of
new
york
is
the
obscenity
standard.
in
effect,
limit
the
ban
on
dissemination
to
materials
that
are
obscene.
we
believe
that
most
theoretically
and
realistically,
that
does
not
work.
first
of
all,
as
a
matter
of
theory,
as
i
said
in
my
opening
remarks,
the
obscenity
statute
is
designed,
and
the
standards
that
this
court
has
enunciated,
is
designed
to
protect
the
viewer,
not
the
child
who
is
made
to
perform.
moreover,
even
a
work
is
not
obscene
in
the
legal
definition,
a
child
has
been
abused
in
the
production
of
that
work.
you
cannot
get
away
from
that
fact.
and
moreover,
the
obscenity
standard,
we
would
submit,
is
not
a
sufficient
deterrent
to
deal
with
this
particular
kind
of
issue.
you
have
to
prove...
the
obscenity
standard
requires
you
look
at
community
standards,
to
the
prurient
interests,
to
whether
there's
a
particular
group
involved.
and
i
think
no
case
better
illustrates
why
this
is
an
ineffective
deterrent
than
the
instant
case.
the
defendant
here
was
charged
with
both
disseminating
an
obscene
movie
and
just
disseminating
a
movie
containing
sexual
conduct
of
a
child.
he
was
acquitted
with
respect
to
the
obscenity
on
charges.
and
if
you
read
the
record,
i
thought
that
this
would
be
a
relatively
simple
case.
you
show
the
film
to
the
jury...
i
don't
know
if
the
court
has
seen
the
film
yet
but
it
is
in
the
courthouse
and
it
would
be
relatively
simple.
the
entire
trial
was
devoted
in
this
case,
despite
the
fact
that
these
films
were
entirely
devoted
to
sexual
conduct,
to...
does
this
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
a
particular
group?
now,
i
would
think
when
a
child
is
abused
in
the
making
of
a
film,
society
shouldn't
be
interested
in
whether
or
not
the
film
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
of
a
particular
group.
we
shouldn't
be
interested
in
whether
there
are
other
films
out
there
similar
to
this
film
that
are
sold
regularly.
and
we
shouldn't
be
concerned
about
any
particular
group.
the
jury
was
out
approximately
12
hours
in
this
case,
all
focusing
on...
all
their
questions
show
they
were
focusing
on
the
obscenity
question.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes.
all
focusing
on
the
obscenity
question.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
your
honor.
in
most
of
these
films,
it
is
virtually
impossible
see
where
they
are
made.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
at
one
time
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
that
they
wanted
to
prove
that
the
film
was
made
in
europe,
and
the
judge
rejected
that
saying
that
was
not
relevant
to
the
statutory
scheme,
for
the
reasons
that
i
gave
justice
white,
in
order
to
deter
the
abuse
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
didn't
try
the
case,
but
upon
reading
the
trial
transcript,
i
was
not
surprised
at
the
verdict.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
because
so
much
confusion
was
caused
between
the
experts
on
the
group
involved,
that
i'm
not
sure
the
jury
could
follow
any
intelligent
instructions
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well
actually,
i
think
the
verdicts
in
this
case
are
consistent.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes.
i
think--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--no,
they
wouldn't
have
to...
in
other
words,
obscenity
would
be
irrelevant.
they
could
say
that
the
theme
of
the
film
is
obscene...
i
have
to
withdraw
that.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
instructions
were
given
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
they
could
have
been
instructed
that
once
you
find
the
conviction
on
the
obscenity,
you
don't
reach
the
second.
but
i
don't
think...
i'm
not--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--no.
in
new
york
you
would
only
have
a
double
punishment
problem
if
they
were
served...
if
consecutive
sentences
were
to
be
imposed.
you
would
have
what
i
think
we
call
a
multiplicity.
but
the
only
remedy
with
respect
to
multiplicity
is
you
do
not
allow
the
sentences
to
be
increased.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that
is
correct.
and
that
question
was
suggested:
the
non-obscenity
would
not
be
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
obscenity
count.
i
think
they
would
stand
together.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
but
the
prosecution--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--the
answer
is
yes,
but
the
people
would
not
have
to
prove
the
film--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--yes,
you
could
violate
the
statute.
but
it's
the
problem
of
the
proof
of
obscenity
is
why
the
legislature
did
away--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--now,
it
may
well
be
that
when
we're
dealing
with
protecting
the
viewer
in
the
obscenity
context,
that
we're
prepared
to
pay
the
price
of
standards
that
may
not
effectively
deter
abuse
xx
that
circumstances,
as
i
said
before,
we're
sort
of
dealing
with
a
victimless
crime.
but
i
don't
think
when
we're
dealing
with
protection
of
children,
that
the
new
york
legislature
decide
and
i
would
hope
this
court
would
hold,
that
have
to
run
hope
of
acquittals
in
having
an
ineffective
deterrent
to
the
abuse
of
children.
that
brings
us
to
the
statute
on
its
face.
now,
one
of
the
problems
before
this
court
of
appeals
held
that
obscenity
was
like
a
threshold
question.
if
the
statute
didn't
require
proof
of
obscenity,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
therefore,
there'd
be
no
limiting
construction
possible.
they
didn't
deal
with
proposed
limiting
constructions
or
even
go
to
it,
because
they
said
obscenity
was
the
bottom
line.
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
to
go
through
the
statute
and
at
least
show
why,
on
its
face,
the
statute
is
not
over-broad,
and
in
the
course
of
that,
to
at
least
offer
some
potential
limiting
constructions
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
might
and
probably
would
consider.
first,...
and
it
is
263.15
of
new
york's
penal
law
and
it
is
found,
i
believe,
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
now,
we
have
shorthanded
the
statute
a
little
bit,
but
basically,
it
prohibits
dissemination
of
material
depicting
the
sexual
conduct
of
children.
and
the
sexual
conduct
we
think
is
defined
in
pretty
precise
terms.
it's
bestiality,
sexual
intercourse,
sodomy,
lewd
display
of
the
genitals,
explicit
simulated...
any
of
the
conduct
simulated.
and
if
these
terms
sound
familiar,
they
certainly
are
because
they
are
right
from
the
miller
versus
california
standard
talking
about
the
hardcore
kind
of
sexual
conduct
that
could
be
prohibited
in
the
obscenity
context.
now,
amici
and
our
adversary
have
suggested
that
the
term
"lewd
display
of
the
genitals"
is
vague
and
that
would
deal
with
just
simple
nudity.
i
think
that
a
reading
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
miller
case
and
the
paris
art
theater
case
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
case
in
people
versus
heller
shows
that
that
concern
is
totally
unwarranted.
now,
it's
true
the
new
york
court
has
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
interpret
the
statute,
but
lewd
exhibition
or
lewd
display
of
the
genitals,
at
least
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
and
the
new
york
court
is
concerned,
feels
it
a
patently
offensive
depiction,
designed
to
appeal
to
an
interest
in
sex.
now,
the
amici
point
to
medical
texts
saying
these
medical
texts
would
be
covered
by
this
statute.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way,
i
don't
think
any
reasonable
person,
i
don't
think
any
prosecutor,
i
don't
think
any
jury,
i
don't
think
any
judge
and
i
don't
think
any
bookseller
can
really
look
at
a
medical
text
and
think
for
a
second
that
that
is
a
lewd
display
of
the
genitals
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
judge,
i
think
that
they
were
dealing
with
the
statute
on
its
face,
saying,
in
effect,--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--judge,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
read
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
as
construing
their
own
statute
because
i
think
even
though
they
said
that,
i
don't
think
they
were
focusing
on
lewd
display
of
the
genitals
at
the
time.
they
would
have
to
find
it
inconsistent
with
their
own
decision
in
people
versus
heller.
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion,
which
i
must
say,
in
all
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals,
not
one
of
the
great
exhibits
of
judicial
craftsmanship.
because
they
were
saying
look,
the
statute...
we
will
allow
you...
i
was
going
to
say
hopefully,
this
case
will
go
back
to
the
court
and
i
am
perfectly
prepared
to
tell
that
to
them
during
the
argument
as
well.
but
i
think
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
obscenity
part
of
the
statute,
the
absence.
and
they
said
look,
obscenity
is
not
covered
by
this
statute,
and
that
everything
else
just
follows.
i
don't
think
they
were
really
focusing
on
it.
and
indeed,
i
don't
recall
even
our
brief
or
in
our
adversary's
brief
really
focusing
on
the
term
"lewd
display
of
the
genitals"
at
the
time
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
clearly
not.
but
i
would
urge
your
honor
to
read
the
opinion
in
its
whole
and
entirety.
--mention
that,
but
i
think
a
fair
reading
is
that
the
court
did
not
focus
on
that
issue,
and
their--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--and
if
we
are
right,
if
they
say
you
must
prohibit
obscenity
and
only
obscenity,
and
this
court
says
no,
the
state
can
go
further,
this
case
could
go
back
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
for
them
to
decide
precisely
how
they
think
"lewd"
should
be
defined.
and
i
can
assure
your
honor
that
we
are
going
to
urge
the
court
that
lewd
has
to
be
defined
exactly
as
we
have
suggested
to
this
court,
and
that's
the
way
it
should
be
defined.
and
i
think
if
the
case
goes
back
and
the
court
decides
to
give
a
limiting
construction,
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
will
hold.
they
have
not
so
held
yet.
even
though,
again,
the
language
read
literally
might
cover
that,
i
think
you
have
to
read
a
little
bit
more
into
it,
though.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
not
focused
on.
i
don't
think
the
argument
was
made.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
pardon?
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
unless
there
were
some
other
exception
for
medical
treatise
is
required
by
the
constitution,
i
would
say
the
state
could
not
do
that.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
could
not.
unless
there
were
an
exception
somewhere
else
dealing
with
legitimate
scientific
works.
and
our
adversary
cited
a
number
of
books,
very
fine
and
legitimate
treatises
where
there
are
pictures--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--yes,
the
statute
would
be
over-broad.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
we
certainly
then
could
use
the
broad
analysis
there
and
say
that
the
statute
might
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
a
particular
group
of
cases,
but
the
statute
still
would
survive,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
oh,
no,
sir,
they
certainly
were
not.
so
the
term
"lewd"
i
think
really
has
not
been
defined
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
this
court
has
looked
at
the
term
similarly,
and
it
is
clearly
the
legislative
intent.
the
fact,
that
they
use
the
word
"lewd"
and
they
didn't
use
simple
nudity
to
describe
the
kind
of
conduct,
so
there
really
isn't
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
term
"lewd".
next,
the
question
is:
is
there
really
a
real
fear
of
over-breadth
with
respect
to
the
statute.
and
we
think
really
not.
our
adversary...
amici
points
to
a
whole
number
of
books
that
say
look,
they
are
covered
by
the
statute.
by
and
large,
those
are
books
that
may
have
some
display
of
genitalia
but
not
in
a
lewd
way
at
all,
and
i
don't
think
anyone
could
disagree
with
that.
there
is
some
simple
nudity
but
this
statute
is
very
carefully
drawn,
it
does
not
cover
simple
nudity.
what
it
does
cover
is
nudity
when
accompanied
by
an
explicit,
simulated
sexual
act.
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
almost
all
these
books
do
not.
and
if
there
is
one
somewhere,
or
two
somewhere,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
pretty
small
price
to
be
paid
for
the
statute
in
the
way
it
protects
children.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
judge,
my
quick
look
around
shows
me
that
there's
nothing
lewd
in
any
of
that.
and
anyway,
i
would
doubt--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--still
looking,
i
don't
see
anything...
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
prosecutor
in
this
country
or
a
jury
in
this
country...
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
is
you
have
to
take
a
picture
and
then
disseminate
it
in
new
york.
i
don't
think
there's
a
real
fear
of
that
at
all.
now,
even
assuming
that
the
first
amendment
somehow
requires
some
kind
of
limited
exception
for
educational,
medical
and
scientific
material,
it
certainly
can
be
read
into
the
statute
if
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
would
choose
to
do
so.
amici
has
suggested
what
we
think
is
a
fine
standard,
and
that
is
educational,
medical
and
scientific
materials
which
as
an
essential
part
of
their
presentation
contain
depiction
of
sexual
conduct
by
children.
the
fact
that
the
statute
doesn't
have
it
doesn't
make
the
statute
fatally
over-broad.
it's
something
that,
once,
could
be
dealt
with
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
or
even
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
chose
to
do
so,
could
read
it
in.
the
other
kind
of
over-breadth
that
is
pointed
to,
and
i
think
it
can't
be
serious,
is
what
i
call
the
dissemination
kind
of
over-breadth.
previously
i
was
talking
about
content
over-breadth.
what
i
mean
by
dissemination
over-breadth,
i
sent
these
films
to
the
court,
pursuant
to
a
request
from
the
court.
literally
under
the
statute,
i
have
disseminated
the
films.
now,
even
though
i
was
a
prosecutor,
i
didn't
feel
prosecution,...
i
don't
think
anyone...
i
wasn't
discouraged
at
all,
i
wasn't
worried
about
it
at
all,
and
i
think
the
so-called
dissemination
over-breadth
is
just
not
a
real
threat,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
situations
that
they
posit.
for
example,
giving
the
copies
of
the
films
to
the
news
media
to
show
so
that
the
news
media
will
write
stories
about
the
films,
and
give
them
to
the
television
media.
i
don't
think
there's
a
real
fear
and
certainly
could
be
limited.
by
the
way,
the
statute
expressly
gives
an
affirmative
defense
to
librarians.
so
you
don't
have
any
concern
with
respect
to
them.
and
although
the
statute
uses
the
word
"procure",
i
don't
think
it
means
in
the
possessory
sense,
but
rather,
procure
for
the
purposes
of
further
distribution.
but
simply,
the
statute,
we
think,
is
crafted
to
deal
with
a
very,
very
serious
problem.
a
problem
that
cannot
be
dealt
with
by
simply
prohibiting
the
use
and
production.
seeing
my
white
light,
i
have
five
minutes,
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
turn
to
the
under-inclusive
argument
first.
in
erznoznik,
you
didn't
have
a
situation
like
you
have
here.
here
you
have
a
market
that's
being
fed,
a
dissemination
market
that's
being
fed.
the
only
way
you
can
get
at
that
market
is
to
ban
the
dissemination
of
these
materials.
there's
no
market
for
pictures
of
circus
performers
made
clandestinely,
whether
they
are
children
walking
on
tightropes,
being
shot
out
of
a
canon,
swinging
on
the
trapeze.
there's
no
problem
with
respect
to
that
market
at
all,
and
therefore,
the
legislature
had
a
very
good
reason
for
choosing--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--judge,
we
have
cited
in
our
appendix--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--judge,
the
virginia
supreme
court
was
prepared
to
say
that
the
industry
was
$500
million
a
year.
and
certainly,
if
the
virginia--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--and
if
you
were
a
state
legislator
you
could,
and
the
new
york
state
legislature
did
find
out
and
they
did
make
that
determination.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
pretty
good
finding.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no.
there,
if
you
look
at
what
we
call
the
bill
jacket,
you
will
see
comments
from
various
legislators
that
they
had
hearings.
one
on
the
mental
health
committee
had
a
hearing,
for
example,
and
they
were
shown
any
number
of
films
that
were
freely
produced
in
the
market--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
judge,
i
can't
prove
it
empirically,
it's
true.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
legislature
is
entitled
to
make
some
findings
based
on
the
information
that
is
available
to
them.
and
they
did
make
a
finding.
i
might
say
that
our
adversaries
have
never
disputed
the
size
of
the
child
pornography
market.
they
have
never
said
we
are
wrong
about
that.
they
never
took
us
up
on
that.
and
we
under-estimated
in
our
brief.
we
talked
about
$200
million
a
year.
whether
it's
$200
million
or
$500
million,
we've
never
been
challenged
by
either
the
amici
or
the
respondent
in
that
regard.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
along
with
the
legislature's
finding,
should
be
good
enough
for
this
court.
i
can
see
from
your
reaction
that
i'm
not
persuading
you--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--1977.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
there
was
some
testimony
in
a
hearing
by
a
police
officer...
i
think
police
officer
rice...
who
said
when
this
statute
was
passed,
the
stuff
started
to
disappear.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
we
do
not.
but
it
disappeared
from
adult
bookstores.
it's
still
a
very
big
mail
order
business
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
you
know,
show
me
is
an
interesting
case.
you
know,
we
were
hauled
into
district
court
in
new
york
about
show
me.
as
soon
as
the
statute
was
passed.
and
you
know,
we
went
in
and
we
said
we've
never
even
heard
of
this
book;
we
have
no
plans
to
prosecute
it,
we
don't
know--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
it
is
possible
that
he
could.
there's
at
least
one
picture
in
there
that
would
cause
some
concern.
but
let
me
say,
judge,
that
we're
talking
about
one
book
out
of
so
many
that--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--no,...
let
me
try
to
respond
to
that.
because
in
the
future,
people
that
are
making
these
books
that
want
to
sell
them,
all
they
have
to
do
is
not
use
these
kind
of
photographs.
you
can
get
the
exact
same
idea
across
in
sexual
education
of
children
without
showing
children
engaged
in
actual
sexual
conduct
or
simulated
sexual
conduct.
you
don't
need
to
use
the
children
with
respect
to
that.
and
if
this
statute
is
upheld,
people
will
be
aware
of
that
fact.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
a
real
fear.
and
you
can
trot
out
so
many
books,
but
there's...
for
example,
during
argument,
prostitutes
of
bombay.
there's
nothing
in
that
book
that
comes
within
the
statute.
and--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--i
understand
that.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
okay.
in
sum,
the
first
amendment
is
not
absolute.
it
has
to
be
balanced,
and
we
believe
this
statute
strikes
the
appropriate
balance.
thank
you.
