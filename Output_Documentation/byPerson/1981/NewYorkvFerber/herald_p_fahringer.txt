mr.
herald
price
fahringer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
it
is
our
view
that
if
this
statute
is
resurrected,
it
would
mark
an
abrupt
departures
from
an
unbroken
series
of
cases
extending
over
a
long
stretch
of
this
court's
history,
holding
as
postulate
the
proposition
that
whenever
any
law
is
conceded,
as
this
one
is,
to
suppress
constitutionally-protected
material,
or
non-obscene
material,
despite
the
compelling
state
interest,
where
there
are
available
alternatives
less
restrictive,
it
has
never
been
tolerated.
it
is
my
view,
your
honors,
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
condemned
this
statute
because
it
imposed
significant
burdens
on
freedom
of
speech
without
any
assurances
that
it
would
give
any
added
protection
to
the
young
people
of
this
country,
beyond
those
already
provided
by
two,
what
i
consider
to
be,
very
effective
statutes:
the
law
that
makes
it
a
felony
to
use
a
child
in
the
production
of
a
film
or
a
book,
and
the
law
that
makes
it
a
felony,
increases
punishment,
if
a
person
sells
that
book--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i
believe
it's
valid,
your
honor.
and
i
say--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--because,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--your
honor,
let
me
say
this:
i
am
talking,
of
course,
about
sexual
conduct.
i
can
understand--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--yeah.
your
honor,
what
i'm
suggesting
is...
if
i
can
correct
my
answer
to
this
extent...
i
think
in
terms
of
not
nudity,
not
even
lewd
nudity.
i
think
in
terms
of--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i
welcome
it,
your
honor.
then
i
would
say
no,
they
cannot.
what
i
was
thinking
of
was
taking--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--no,
your
honor,
they
cannot.
what
i
say
is
this...
if
they
used--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--because,
your
honor,
i
was
only
thinking
in
terms
of
sexual
conduct,
using
young
children
in
commission
of
sexual
acts,
which
per
se
is
obscene.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
your
honor,
you
may
be
correct.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
if,
your
honor,
there
were
findings
that
that
would
be
harmful
to
the
children,
i
think
the
state
has
the
power
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
i--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--your
honor,
that's
not
the
issue,
but
i
am
happy
to
discuss
it
with
you
if
you
like.
what
i'm
saying
is
this:
i
think
throughout
this
whole
area,
if
it
please
your
honor,
what
happens
to
all
of
us
is
there
have
been
very
few
actual
scientific
findings
in
this
area.
they
take
for
granted,
your
honor,
that
the
distribution
of
a
film...
and
they
make
this
second
argument
in
this
case...
that
this
would
have
some
sort
of
an
impact
upon
the
child.
let's
take
a
14
or
15-year
old
who
is
photographed
nude.
putting
aside
sexual
conduct.
they
say
that
that,
of
course,
is
clearly
condemned
under
the
statute
and
there
has
to
be
no
finding
of
obscenity.
i'm
not
sure
what
they--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
they
obviously
had
great
misgivings
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
or
they--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--but
they
wouldn't
have
enacted
the
other
section
which
this
section
completely
duplicates.
i
don't
agree
with
the
prosecution
in
terms
of
the
trial
of
this
case,
and
i
tried
it,
your
honor.
obviously,
you
have
no
need
for
the
section
that
makes
it
obscene
to
sell
these
films
if
you
have
a
section
that
says
just
sexual
conduct
in
itself
is
enough.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
but,
your
honor,
all
i'm--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
all--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
they
had
misgivings
about
section
6...
the
15,.15
section,
obviously,
because
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
one
requiring
the
obscenity.
all
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
if
it
please
you
is
that
creating
the
two
sections,
obviously
you
have
to
conclude
from
that,
as
they
did
in
the
commentary
under
the
legislative
history,
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
this
section...
i'm
sorry,
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
obscenity
section
if
this
section
was
constitutional.
it
seems
to
me
the
only
conclusion
you
can
draw
is
their
fear
that
this
section
would
be
declared
unconstitutional
and
they
have
an
obscenity
section.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
otherwise
to
the
court.
and,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
follow
that
logic
to
its
conclusion,
in
the
trial
of
this
case
if
they
had
found
the
defendant
guilty
under
either
one
of
the
sections,
the
verdicts
would
have
been
repugnant
then.
because
obviously,
one
duplicates
oneself
inclusive
of
the
other.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
one
is
inclusive.
the
non-obscenity
section
obviously
would
include
the
obscenity
section
because
it
means...
if
the
two
children
were
just
shown
participating
in
anything
that
was
not
obscene,
the
man
is
convicted.
there
would
absolutely
be
no
need
then
to
find
the
obscenity
section.
if
you
found
the
obscenity
section,
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
need
to
go
further
and
find
the
non-obscenity.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes,
your
honor,
i
would.
and
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
a
verdict
that
would
have
been
returned
on
both
counts
would
have
posed
very
serious--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i
think
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
no,
not--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--absolutely,
your
honor.
i
have
never
had
a
quarrel
with
the
fact...
i
don't
know
scientifically
how
sound
this
is,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
children
below
the
age
of
16
involved
in
sexual
activity,
where
there
is
a
serious
question
of
whether
they're
consenting
to
it
and
the
harmfulness
that,
of
course,
can
occur
to
them.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
think
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
think
they
could.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
think
they
could,
because--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--but
i
think,
your
honor,
as
a
part
and
parcel
that
i
have
to
say
in
answer
to
your
question
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
indication,
some
finding,
that
it
was
harmful
to
the
children.
obviously,
to
do
it
with
children
that
are--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i
think,
your
honor,
under
the
circumstances
i
would.
but
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
your
honor,
is
a
far
cry
from
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
sustain
this
statute
really
does
imperil
a
large
body
of
literature
that
could
be
of
some
worth
to
society.
and
i
would
like
to--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i'm
not
sure
it's
the
most
compelling.
i
would
say
drugs
might
go
above
that,
your
honor.
but
what
i
say
to
you
is
that
two
statutes,
if
it
please
your
honor,
that
we
now
have
in
existence
which
came
out
of
that
same
offensive
against
child
pornography,
are
more
than
adequate
to
deal
with
the
problem.
that's
my
only
thesis
here
in
this
court.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
there's
no
question,
your
honor,
it
was
an
adventure
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
go
one
step
further
and
to
get
convictions
in
this
area
without
the
proof
of
obscenity.
what
i've
said...
you
know,
when
they
conducted
congressional
hearings
in
this
matter
and
experts
came
from
all
over
the
country,
as
mr.
pitler
pointed
out,
and
the
federal
government
enacted
law,
with
equal
concerns
just
as
compelling
to
them,
the
conclusion
of
the
consensus
of
experts
was
that
the
child
pornography
we're
talking
about
can
be
easily
convicted
under
an
obscenity
statute.
and
there
is
no
need
to
eliminate
this
element
and
jeopardize
all
this
other
literature
which
could
be
of
some
use
to
society.
that's
what
the
federal
government
came
to,
and
i
think
that's
persuasive,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
26
other
states
in
this
country
presumably
conducting
hearings
also
concluded
that
they
could
wage
war
successfully
against
pornography--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--no,
i'm
not.
what
i'm
saying
is
it's
being
prosecuted
all
over
the
country,
it's
being
prosecuted
in
miami,
florida
right
now
and
federal
court
in
cases
i
know
about
it.
and
i'll
tell
you
this,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
may
say
this
in
all
due
respect,
you
have
that
same
problem
in
the
drug
trade,
but
no
one
has
ever
suggested
we
reduce
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
drug
business
and
eliminate
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
presumption
of
innocence
because
it's
hard
to
get
convictions.
i
think
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
is
probably
paramount
to
everything
else,
and
yet
we
haven't
discarded
these
procedural
safeguards
that
this
court
has
built
up
over
the
years
so
that
it's
easier
to
convict
drug
distributors,
which
is
also
done
in--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--well
let
me
give
you
an
example,
your
honor.
this
book,
show
me,
that
is
prominently
featured
in
both
of
the
briefs
is
a
respectable
book,
it
was
produced
in
germany
with
very
young
children
in
it,
and
the
book
is
avowedly
for
the
purpose
of
educating
children
in
adolescent
sex.
now,
that
book,
your
honor,
certainly...
i
don't
think
anybody
in
the
world
would
doubt
that
that
book
could
be
prosecuted
under
this
section.
there
are
people
in
new
york...
and
this
is
a
matter
of
public
record...
that
have
spoken
out
against
the
book
and
have
gone
on
the
air
and
condemned
the
book.
so
much
so
that
the
publisher
of
that
book,
of
course,
launched
the
declaratory
judgment
action--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--yes,
your
honor,
there's--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--what
i
said
is
this,
your
honor,
that
i
could
conceive
of
the
state's
interest
in
terms
of
making
non-obscene
films,
people
who
put
children
together
in
non-obscene
films
and
the
children
are
actually
engaged
in
the
conduct,
that
that
might
be
prohibited
with
a
finding
that
this
would
be
harmful
to
the
children.
i
certainly
would
assume
that
it's
harmful
to
the
children.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
your
honor,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
if
you
took
a
15-year
old
boy
an
a
17--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
legislature
would
need
anybody
to
tell
them
that.
but
you
certainly
have
14
and
15-year
olds
under
a
16-year
statute,
a
headline,
a
top,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
you
took
a
15-year
old
boy
and
a
16-year
old
girl
and
used
them
to
make
a
sex
manual
where
they
were
not
involved
in
explicit
sexual
acts
but
used
it
for
the
purposes
of
educating
adolescents
about
sexual
behavior
but
it
was
quite
explicit,
they
were
touching
one
another,
i
can
understand
how
people
might
come
forward
and
say
that
this
would
not
damage
these
children
for
the
rest
of
their
life
if
it
was
done
in
a
clinical
environment.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
oh,
your
honor,--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
what
we're
saying
is...
if
it
please
the
court...
i
don't
mean
to
offend
you,
but
in
the
amicus
brief,--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--but
the
point
of
it
is
in
the
amicus
brief,
we
have
listed
the
growing
number
of
books
that
are
being
used
today
to
educate
adolescents
in
sexual
behavior
with
pictures
and
photographs,
and
that's
basically
the
book
show
me
which
is
discussed
in
both
briefs
here
and
they
brought
a
declaratory
action
under
this
statute
because
they
were
fearful
they
were
going
to
be
prosecuted.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
because
of
the
historic
difference
in
this
court
that
we
have
always
made
between
goods
and
things
of
that
sort
and
the
first
amendment.
when
the
picture
goes
into
a
book,
your
honor,
it
becomes
an
idea,
and
then
it
comes--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes,
i
can
see
how
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
could
certainly...
you
mean
if
you
eliminated
all
16-year
old
actresses
in
this
country,
they
couldn't
make
a
film
and
brooke
shields
and
everybody
else
would
be
out
of
business?
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor,
because
i
think
they're
an
integral
part
of
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
making
these
films,
and
the
same
way
if
you
said
that--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
if
it
were
not
discriminatory.
in
other
words,
if
you're
saying
they
just
took
16-year
olds
and
said
they
couldn't
work
in
films.
if
they
said
16-year
olds
couldn't
work
in
any
industry
at
all,
couldn't
do
any
kind
of--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i'm
sorry,
then,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
would
be
consistent
if
the
state
made
that
judgment.
it
eliminates
it
then
from
the
first
amendment
concern
because
you're
talking
about
it
across
the
board...
that
a
16-year
old
can't
work
at
anything
in
this
country,
and
that
would
seem
to
me
that--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--there
would
be
no
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it's
accommodated
by
the
obscenity
statute,
because
those
films
would
be
found
obscene
and
they
would
be
illegal
anyway
in
the
distribution
line.
what
i
keep
coming
back
to
here...
and
i
really
think
this
is
the
core
of
our
argument...
and
that
is,
the
statutes
that
are
on
the
books
of
new
york
right
now,
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
really
found,
are
more
than
adequate
to
accommodate
these
problems.
the
problem
you
just
posed
is
certainly
taken
care
of
by
an
obscenity
statute.
you
don't
need
for
that
purpose
a
statute
that
says
any
conduct
of
any
kind
is
forbidden
and
make
it
a
felony
for
a
person
to
sell
a
book
like
show
me
or
youth
and
sex
or
some
of
the
other
books
that
we
demonstrate
in
the
amicus
brief
here.
i
might
say
this,
if
it
please
your
honor,
that
there
are
indications
in
the
amicus
brief
that
this
literature,
which
certainly
could
lend
itself
to
prosecution
under
this
statute...
the
district
attorney
says
we
would
never
prosecute
anybody
like
that,
but
certainly
this
court
has
seen
enough
evidence
of
people
coming
forward
and
inaugurating
prosecutions
through
prosecutors
in
small
rural
communities
which
are
shocking
to
all
of
us.
taking
the
fixer
out
of
the
library,
the
naked
ape,
slaughterhouse
five.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
absolutely.
your
honor,
let
me
tell
you
what
happened
in
this
case.
they
went
on--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--the
reason
for
that,
if
i
can
tell
your
honor,
was
that
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
decided
to
proceed
under
the
unique
theory
established
this
by
court
in
michigan
versus
new
york
and
said
that
these
films
would
only
appeal
to
male
homosexuals.
now,
your
honor,
from
my
standpoint
as
a
trial
lawyer,
i
tell
you,
that
took
it
right
out
of
the
jury's
lap.
the
question
was,
would
these
movies
appeal
only
to
a
male
homosexual.
two
experts
came
in
and
testified
that
surveys
had
been
run
in
prisons
in
connecticut,
and
that
87
%
of
the
people
were
heterosexual
and
had
families.
and
another
expert
came
in
and
testified...
at
that
time,
your
honor,
the
kinsey
report
on
homosexuals
had
just
come
out
which
absolutely
contradicted
that.
it
was
a
guess
on
his
part,
so
the
jury
had
a
very
easy
decision.
it
was
confusing,
there
was
a
lot
of
expert
testimony.
but
i
am
convinced,
your
honor,
as
the
person
who
tried
the
case
that
what
they
found
is
that
the
overwhelming
empirical
evidence
was
that
these
films
would
not
appeal
to
a
male
homosexual.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honor
as
an
officer
of
this
court,
had
it
been
tried
on
the
straight
obscenity
level
with
the
average
person
sitting
in
that
jury
box
saying
would
these
films
appeal
to
my
morbid
or
shameful
interest
in
sex,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
there
would
have
been
a
conviction.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
because,
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
injury
to
the
children
is
accommodated
by
the
law
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
use
them
and
by
the
law
that
makes
their
crime--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--only
that,
your
honor,
the
third
statute
in
this
case,
based
upon
a
long
line
of
decisions
out
of
this
court,
goes
much
further.
it
will
imperil,
it
will
suppress
a
good
deal
of
useful
literature.
now,
it
may
not
be
that
medical
books
are
going
to
be
suppressed
here,
but
your
honor,
may
i
put
this
question.
what
if
someone
wanted
to
write
a
book
on
child
pornography
and
use
some
examples
of
it?
what
about
sixty
minutes?
what
about
the
woman
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
who
actually
took
some
of
the
material
before
she
wrote
the
law
review
article?
there's
no
question
she's
guilty
under
this
statute,
and
if
she
had
wanted
to
use
any
of
the
examples
in
her
book...
if
covenant
house,
morality
in
media,
wanted
to
advocate
their
cause
with
visual
pictures
in
their
publication
showing
what
a
horrible
thing
child
pornography
is
in
this
country,
they
would
be,
guilty
under
this
section.
and
i
just
think
that's
preposterous.
and
i
also
want
to
talk
about
the
books
that
come
in
from...
how
about
the
book,
prostitutes
in
bombay?
how
about
incest
in
peru?
if
these
books
come
into
this
country,
books
that
are
surveys
of
serious
sexual
problems
today
dealing
with
adolescents,
none
of
those
books
would
be
available
for
sale
in
new
york
under
this
section.
because
there's
no
question,
i
think
in
many
of
those
instances
there
would
be
lewd
pictures,
and
there
is
no
question
that
there
might
even
be
sexual
conduct.
and
yet
you
could
not
sell
those
books
in
this
country,
even
though
they
were
worthwhile
and
had
some
scientific
value.
incidentally,
i
wanted
to
just--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
people
who
say
it
would.
obviously,
you
know
my
bias
and
i
don't
think
it
is.
but
i
want
to
tell
you
this:
that
there
is
touching
among
the
young
children
and--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--it
wasn't,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
agree
with
mr.
pitler.
i
was
there
and
i
think
he
was
in
the
courtroom
and
it
was
never
discussed
at
all.
but
it's
clear
to
me--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--and
then
you
see,
it
seems
to
me
we
come
to
the
most
troublesome
aspect
of
all
in
this
case,
the
chilling
effect,
the
impact
it's
going
to
have
on
responsible
publishers.
a
book
like
show
me
may
not
be
put
out
because
maybe,
maybe
somewhere
in
watertown,
new
york
or
in
an
outlying
area,
someone
might
come
in
and
bring
a
criminal
action
against
the
publisher.
so
we'll
never
know
what
books,
either
in
sexual
manuals,
descriptions
of
adolescent
sex
or
books
that
have
to
do
with
exposes
of
the
problem,
will
never
be
published
because--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--your
honor,
let
me
say
this
in
all--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--your
honor,
that
is
not
true.
in
this
case
we
tried
to
prove
that
these
films--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--no,
your
honor,
all
i'm
saying
is...
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
the
fact
that
in
the
record
we
made
an
effort
here,
we
made
an
offer
of
proof,
to
show
that
these
films
came
in
from
out
of
the
country.
the
judge
sustained
the
objection
and
we
weren't
able
to--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i
realize
that,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
an
awful
lot
of
books
and
films...
and
i'm
talking
now
about
material
that
has
some
scientific
value
or
some
literary
value...
are
produced
overseas.
and
certainly,
when
they
come
into
this
country
the
american
public
should
have
a
right
to
see
them.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
that
has
already
been
foreclosed
in
new
york
by
a
case
up
there,
your
honor,
that
forbids
that
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
they
ruled
on
it,
your
honor...
it
had
to
do
with
publications,
but
they
said
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
require
a
publisher
to
put
his
name
on
the
pamphlet
or
the
book
because
it
might,
of
course,
inhibit
his
putting
out
controversial
books.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
under
state
law,
that's
right,
your
honor.
under
our
new
york
state
constitution.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
all...
all
we
come
back
to,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
everything
we're
talking
about
in
this
court
would
be
found
obscene
under
the
obscenity
statute.
one
of
the
things
that
is
disturbing
to
me
is
the
prosecution
hasn't
come
forward
with
any
figures,
any
statistics
of
any
kind
to
indicate
that
we
simply
cannot
go
forward
with
these
prosecutions
without
this
third
section.
there's
no
statistics
here
that
we've
tried
37
child
pornography
cases
and
we
have
only
been
able
to
get
two
convictions.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
other
statistics
across
the
country.
the
few
law
review
articles
that
are
cited
are
really
very
self-serving
and
they're
speculative
by
people
who
have
views
in
the
industry.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
only
way
to
go
about
that
in
a
logical
fashion
is
to
say
that
we
can't
get...
26
states
apparently
feel
that
they
can
conduct
this
campaign
against
child
pornography
successfully
with
what
they've
got,
and
the
federal
government
feels
that
way.
now
that,
i
think,
lends
force
to
my
position
here
today
that
until
they
come
in
and
show
this
court,
we
simply
cannot
prosecute
child
pornographers
unless
we
have
this
third
arm,
it
seems
to
me
that
recognizing
that
it
imperils
all
this
other
literature,
it
seems--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--and
what
i'm
saying
in
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
is
an
incisive
question.
one
is
if
it's
the
protected
material,
that
they
are
never
going
to
go
after
the
books
and
things
of
that
sort,
obviously
there's
never
going
to
be
a
prosecution
under
the
so-called
legitimate
material.
if
it's
the
other
material,
that
is
the
42nd
street
times
square
material,
that's
going
to
be
found
obscene
under
the
obscenity
doctrine
anyway.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
no
question.
but,
your
honor,
i
do
think
that's
a
compelling
reason.
we
don't
have
a
case
were
they
tried
it
under
a
straight
obscenity
statute
where
it
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
themselves
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
would
appeal
to
our
morbid
or
shameful
interest
in
sex.
and
that's
the
case,
it
seems
to
me,
you
need,
not
a
case
where
it
would
appeal
to
a
deviant
group.
because
i
could
easily
understand
how
a
jury
would
find
this
would
appeal
to
us,
our
own
morbid
or
shameful
interest
in
sex,
but
it
certainly...
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary
with
another
group.
your
honor,
i
would
only...
since
i
see
that
my
time
is
expiring,...
the
language
you
used
in
the
shad
case
which
is
one
of
your
most
recent
cases
and
one
that
we
rely
very
heavily
on
in
our
brief,
where
you
said
that
the
state
has
really
not
established
its
interests
could
not
be
met
by
methods
that
are
less
restrictive
on
protected
forms
of
expression.
and
there
you
said...
and
i
think
it
applies
to
this
case...
that
even
if
the
infringement
is
incidental
and
only
applies
to
a
small
number
of
cases
in
the
first
amendment
area,
we
must
still
scrutinize
that
regulation
with
great
care
to
see
whether
or
not
there
are
other
methods
available
to
reach
the
state's
objective.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
think
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
you
mean
in
the
decision?
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i'm
sorry,
i
can't.
i
thought
it
was
implied.
i
don't
think--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--it
may
not
have
been,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
what
i
wanted
to
read
to
you
is
this,
the
very
end
of--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
they
agreed
that
there
is
a
concern,
but
they
said
in
the
end
of
their
opinion
those
who
employ
children
in
obscene
plays,
films,
books
are
still
subject
to
prosecution
in
this
state,
as
are
those
who
sell
or
distribute
obscene
material.
all
we
hold
today
is
that
those
who
present
films,
plays
or
books
portraying
adolescent
sex
in
a
realistic
but
not
obscene
manner
cannot
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
that
may
be
correct,
your
honor.
one
of
the
things
that
you've
just
alerted
me
to
that
i
haven't
even
discussed
with
this
court
is
that
they
spent
an
awful
lot
of
time
finding
that
this
statute
was
under-inclusive.
they
said
that
if
the
state's
real
concern
is
the
welfare
of
children,
then
why
isn't
it
that
they
do
the
same
thing
with
children
who
over-work
long
hours
and
are
not
paid
or
whatever,
and
do
dangerous
stunts
and
things
of
that
sort.
and
to
me,
that
does
make
a
lot
of
sense.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far.
they
even
say
that
it
appears
as
though
they've
just
selected
this
class
of
material--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--well,
it--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--well,
it
wasn't
erznoznik
because
there,
what
you
said
in
erznozkik
with
the
drive-in
theater
that
they
only
picked
nudist
films
to
foreclose--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--content-oriented.
well,
that's
what
this
basically
is,
your
honor,
content-oriented.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
the
distribution
part
is.
in
any
event,
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
preoccupation
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
that
phase
of
it.
and
what
i
wanted
to
simply
state,
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
seems
as
though
they
just
selected
this
one
narrow
area
because
of
the
legislator's
distaste
for
this
type
of
material.
your
honors,
i'll
end
as
i
began,
by
simply
saying
that
it
really
seems
to
me
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
compelling,
and
there's
none
to
the
contrary,
that
the
two
statutes
that
are
in
existence
in
new
york
are
more
than
adequate
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
it's
unnecessary
to
impose
significant
restrains
on
free
speech
where
there
are
existing
alternatives.
thank
you.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
would
still
have
some
problems
with
that
if
it
were
going
to...
if
it
is
civil
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
it
has
a
deterrent
effect,
and
i
would
think
that
it
could
run
afoul
of
the
first
amendment.
