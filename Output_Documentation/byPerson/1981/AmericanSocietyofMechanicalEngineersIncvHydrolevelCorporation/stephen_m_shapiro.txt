mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
upheld
the
jury's
verdict
imposing
liability
on
asme.
i
would
like
first
to
explain
why
the
jury's
verdict
should
be
sustained,
and
then
describe
the
serious
adverse
effects
which
would
result
from
acceptance
of
asme's
contrary
theories.
as
the
briefs
in
the
record
in
this
case
vividly
demonstrate,
private
organizations
which
prescribe
standards
for
products
sold
in
interstate
commerce
have
great
power
to
improve
economic
performance
and
great
power
to
inflict
economic
harm.
standardmaking
activities
can
facilitate
commerce
by
increasing
consumer
information
and
by
promoting
product
safety.
however,
those
activities
also
can
deprive
consumers
of
new
and
valuable
products,
and
inflict
serious
injury
on
competitors,
dangers
which
are
heightened
by
conflicts
of
interest
which
often
are
present
in
codemaking
bodies.
the
code
interpretation
which
caused
the
competitive
harm
in
this
case
appears
as
the
first
appendix
to
the
red
brief
filed
by
hydrolevel.
that
interpretation
bears
the
names
of
all
of
the
officers
of
asme'
boiler
and
pressure
vessel
committee,
is
signed
by
the
secretary
of
the
committee,
and
expresses
the
views
of
the
chairman
of
the
concerned
subcommittee
on
the
intent
of
the
asme
code.
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
had
expressly
delegated
authority
to
render
code
interpretations
of
this
kind,
and
it
is
conceded
that
the
interpretation
was
made
pursuant
to
asme's
standard
operating
procedures.
asme
persuaded
the
district
court
that
it
should
not
be
held
accountable
for
this
document
unless
the
jury
found
that
its
agents
intended
to
benefit
asme
or
that
asme
ratified
their
actions,
and
after
the
judge
charged
the
jury
to
that
effect,
asme
stated
that
the
charge
was
wholly
satisfactory.
even
under
this
instruction,
which
was
drafted
in
large
measure
by
asme
itself,
the
jury
imposed
liability.
as
hydrolevel's
brief
demonstrates
in
some
detail--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
my
point
is
simply
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
quite
true,
and
even
under
their
version
of
the
law,
they
lost.
that
is
the
only
point
we
wish
to
make,
and
that
in
addition,
the
record
supports
the
inference
that
the
jury
reached
that
liability
was
appropriate
under
the
standards.
the
record
shows
that
asme's
subcommittee
chairman
believed
he
was
acting
in
a
way
that
served
asme's
general
safety
objectives,
even
though
he
intentionally
rendered
an
interpretation
that
was
unduly
restrictive
of
hydrolevel's
product.
indeed,
asme
stated
in
its
answer
to
the
complaint,
and
i
quote,
"the
statements
contained
in
the
letter
of
april
29,
1971,
were
made
by
asme
in
furtherance
of
asme's
legitimate
interest
in
the
promulgation
of
safety
standards.
"
the
jury
also
could
infer
that
asme's
subsequent
actions,
including
its
commendation
of
its
officers'
conduct
and
its
insistence
throughout
the
entire
trial
that
the
letter
was
proper,
demonstrated
ratification
or
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
asme.
although
the
judgment
below
can
be
sustained
on
the
simple
ground
that
asme
got
the
charge
that
it
demanded
but
nonetheless
lost
under
that
charge,
on
a
record
containing
substantial
evidence
in
hydrolevel's
favor,
we
quite
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
charge
was
overly
generous
to
asme,
and
should
not
receive
general
endorsement.
the
charge
fails
to
make
clear
the
basic
rule
of
agency
law
that
a
principal
is
bound
by
acts
of
agents
who
perform
delegated
functions
even
if
they
have
a
partial
purpose
to
benefit
some
person
other
than
their
principal,
in
addition
to
a
purpose
to
benefit
the
principal.
any
other
rule
would
place
under
obstacles
in
the
path
of
government
injunctions,
cease
and
desist
orders--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--our
position
is
that
there
are
three
alternative
grounds
that
equally
would
support
the
judgment
in
favor
of
hydrolevel.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
indeed.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
doctrine
of
apparent
authority
is
available
in
antitrust
cases
as
in
comparable
tort
suits.
apparent
authority
has
been
the
basis
for
many
jury
charges
in
federal
antitrust
cases
in
the
past,
some
of
which
are
collected
in
the
american
bar
association's
volume
entitled
jury
instructions
in
criminal
antitrust
cases.
the
apparent
authority
doctrine
has
been
approved
in
antitrust
cases
by
the
sixth,
the
third,
and
the
second
circuits,
and
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
courts
have
never
drawn
any
such
line,
and
indeed
this
court's
decisions
have
held
in
many
situations
that
the
non-profit
entity
is
subject
to
precisely
the
same
rules
as
the
profitmaking
entity.
congress
extended
the
prohibitions
of
the
sherman
act
to
every
person,
including
non-profit
associations,
as
this
court
has
held
in
a
long
line
of
cases.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
your
honor
is
correct.
none
of
the
apparent
authority
cases
in
the
antitrust
area
that
we
rely
on
dealt
specifically
with
non-profit
entities.
that
is
quite
correct,
and
i
do
acknowledge
that
point.
however,
this
court's
decisions
have
treated
non-profit
entities
on
a
par
with
other
profitmaking
entities
in
the
past,
and
we
think
the
same
approach
is
appropriate
here.
asme
nonetheless
argues
that
codemaking
bodies
in
the
situation
should
be
able
to
rely
on
a
plea
of
unawareness.
this,
we
submit,
if
accepted,
would
undermine
the
incentives
that
congress
created
under
the
antitrust
laws.
if
courts
were
to
accept
this
plea,
it
would
encourage
codemaking
bodies
to
look
the
other
way
in
the
face
of
the
ever
present
danger
of
anticompetitive
behavior
by
officers
with
conflicts
of
interest.
effective
deterrence
of
anticompetitive
behavior
in
organizations
such
as
asme
is
of
crucial
importance
to
the
national
economy.
as
the
house
subcommittee
on
small
business
stated
in
its
report
number
1981,
in
the
90th
congress,
second
session,
at
page
75,
and
i
quote,
"private
bodies
for
promulgating
standards
are
performing
what
is
essentially
a
governmental
function.
"
"the
standard
may
result
in
economic
prosperity
or
economic
failure
for
a
number
of
businesses
of
all
sizes
throughout
the
country.
"
if
asme
wishes
to
take
upon
itself
authority
to
render
interpretations
that
have
life
or
death
importance
for
american
businesses,
it
must
also
take
responsibility
for
the
actions
of
those
persons
to
whom
it
commits
codemaking
power.
it
is
clear
enough
that
asme
is
willing
to
take
credit
for
the
achievements
of
its
codemaking
officers,
and
to
receive
many
millions
of
dollars
annually
from
the
sale
of
its
codes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
believe
that
the
same
general
principles
of
agency
law
apply
regardless
of
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
does
not.
it
reflects
our
enforcement
concern,
however,
with
this
category
of
case.
there
are
400
standardmaking
bodies
affecting
products
sold
in
interstate
commerce,
and
our
concern
there
is
that
the
antitrust
laws
be
enforced
effectively
to
prevent
restraints
of
trade
which
these
entities
can
so
easily
impose.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
is
our
position,
your
honor.
under
the
silver
case,
we
believe
it
is
mandated,
and
i
would
point
out
in
this
connection
that
asme
now
has
adopted
a
system
that
results
in
precisely
what
we
are
suggesting
is
required
by
the
law,
and
i
would
give
the
court
the
following
citations.
asme
exhibit
volume
110,
and
the
court
of
appeals
appendix,
pages
784
and
804.
asme
now
publishes
requests
for
interpretation
of
this
very
kind,
and
it
publishes
the
proposed
response
in
a
magazine
which
is
entitled
boiler
and
pressure
vessel
interpretation,
and
it
sells
that
to
subscribers
in
large
quantities.
so,
it
is
possible
to
give
notice,
so
that
affected
persons
may
comment
on
proposed
interpretations
that
would
have
the
effect
of
driving
a
competitor
out
of
business,
as
this
case
illustrates
so
vividly.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
are
quite
correct.
it
is
not
a
defense
to
have
an
antitrust
compliance
program,
but
it
provides
substantial
protection
against
the
occurrence
of
cases
like
this.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
does
indeed,
and
if
that
procedure
had
been
followed
in
this
case,
there
never
would
have
been
a
lawsuit
of
this
kind.
if
notice
had
been
given,
and
hydrolevel
had
been
given
an
opportunity
to
comment,
all
of
this
would
have
been
brought
to
light,
and
this
litigation
never
would
have
occurred.
we
submit
that
in
these
circumstances
asme
cannot
wash
its
hands
of
the
work
of
its
officers
when
that
work
inflicts
substantial
injury
on
innocent
business
firms.
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
