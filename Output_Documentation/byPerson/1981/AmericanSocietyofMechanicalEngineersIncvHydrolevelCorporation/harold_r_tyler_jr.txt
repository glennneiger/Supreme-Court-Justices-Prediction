mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petition
of
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers,
which
as
you
know
is
frequently
referred
to
in
the
record
as
asme,
submits
that
this
case
casts
up
in
simple
terms
the
following
issue,
and
that
is
the
question
of
on
what
basis
can
the
acts
of
two
of
the
society's
voluntary
members
of
this
non-profit,
scientific
and
technical
society
be
imputed
to
that
society
for
purposes
of
establishing
liability
under
the
sherman
act.
now,
the
panel
below
answered
this
question
substantially
as
follows,
and
i
am
really
quoting
in
large
measure
from
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
panel
said,
for
asme
to
be
liable
then,
hydrolevel,
the
plaintiff,
had
to
demonstrate
only
that
asme's
agents,
that
is,
two
voluntary
members,
acted
within
their
apparent
authority
when
participating
in
the
conspiracy.
it,
hydrolevel,
did
not
have
to
demonstrate
that
they
also
acted
in
part
to
benefit
asme
or
that
asme
ratified
their
activities.
we
contend
that
this
holding
is
incorrect,
and
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
reasoning
and
judgment
of
liability
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
facts
which
set
the
stage
for
this
relatively
simply
stated
issue
here
in
this
court--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--he
certainly
did,
justice
o'connor,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--no,
we
don't
believe
that
we
have
any
purpose
or
right
to
be
quarreling
with
judge
weinstein's
instructions.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
essentially,
that
is
correct.
what
happened
in
the--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
we
would
agree
with
that,
but
what
we
are
really
urging
is
two
things.
we
see
two
possibilities
here,
justice
white.
one,
we
concede
that
you,
if
you
agree
with
us,
could
reverse
and
remand
this
case
for
consideration
under
appropriate
principles
of
law
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
we
would
like
to
persuade
you,
however,
that
if
you
look
at
the
record,
the
facts
are
really
very
simple,
and
not
really
in
contest,
and
that
on
the
basis
of
those
facts--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--we
claim
that
there
is
no--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--indeed,
we
have
to
conceded
that
the
jury
found--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--we
do
contend
that.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
understand
that.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
but
we
claim
that
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
point
here
is
very
acute,
and
we
stand
on
the
proposition
that
if
you
look
at
the
facts,
there
is
no
basis,
whether
we
are
talking
about
apparent
authority,
actual
authority
to
hold
this
society,
particularly
when
the
agents
were
not
working
for
the
society
when
they
did
what
they
did
to
bring
themselves
into
the
conspiracy.
let
me
just
repeat
these
facts.
i
am
sure
you
will
recall
most
of
them.
the
facts
which
set
up
the
legal
issues
here
really
occurred
in
1971.
in
march
of
that
year,
two
long-time
members
of
the
society,
one
of
them
a
man
named
james
who
then
was
the
vice
president
of
mcdonald
and
miller,
which
then
and
now
was
a
major
manufacturer
and
distributor
of
low
water
cutoff
devices
for
pressure
vessels
and
boilers,
hardin,
who
was
the
vice
president
of
hartford
c.
boyler,
a
big
insurance
company,
sat
down
in
the
drape
hotel
for
dinner
with
some
other
officers
of
mcdonald
and
miller.
for
our
purposes,
the
principal
subject
of
talking
was
how
they
could
use
the
knowledge
of
hardin
and
james
to
put
a
letter
in
in
the
normal
course
or
what
appeared
to
be
the
normal
course
to
the
boiler
pressure
vessel
committee
of
asme
and
to
get
an
answer
which
might
help
mcdonald
and
miller
or
m&m
compete
against
hydrolevel
unfairly
in
the
marketplace.
hydrolevel,
as
you
will
recall,
at
the
time
was
a
small
company,
had
never
had
any
commercial
success,
but
had
developed
a
so-called
probe
type
of
low
water
cutoff
device
for
boilers,
which
incorporated
a
time
principle.
as
a
result
of
that
meeting
in
chicago,
a
letter
was
prepared
with
the
help
of
hardin
and
james,
signed
by
a
man
named
mitchell,
a
sales
official
of
m&m,
sent
in
what
purported
to
be
in
the
regular
course
to
this
committee
of
asme.
it
came
into
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
the
committee,
a
man
named
hoyt,
who
in
the
regular
course
transmitted
it
to
hardin,
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
relevant
subcommittee
of
the
boiler
and
pressure
vessel
committee.
it
appears
quite
clear
that
hardin
had
something
to
do,
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
preparation
of
the
response
which
went
out
to
m&m
on
or
about
april
12th.
hydrolevel's
counsel
suggests
that
hardin
did
this
almost
alone.
that
isn't
quite
true.
it
is
true,
however,
that
james,
oddly
enough,
wasn't
visible
at
that
time,
and
hence
it
seems
to
us
he
can't
be
held
to
have
had
any
apparent
authority
because
he
really
wasn't
visible.
in
any
case,
the
loaded
letter
got
a
loaded
response.
and
after
that,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
sales
representatives
of
m&m
went
out
into
the
marketplace
and
used
this
letter
unfairly
to
depreciate,
if
you
will,
the
hydrolevel
prop.
now,
i
will
stop
there,
although
of
course
there
are
other
facts
in
the
record,
and
i
am
sure
not
only
my
opponents
but
perhaps
myself
will
get
to
those,
but
these
are
really
sufficient
to
set
up
the
legal
problem,
because
we
contend
that
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
these
facts
show
that
these
two
men,
hardin
and
james,
or
one
of
them,
weren't
acting
to
benefit
the
society
at
all.
they
quite
clearly
were
acting
to
benefit
another
principal,
mcdonald
and
miller.
now,
to
step
back
a
moment,
you
will
remember
in
the
court
of
appeals
there
were
two
issues
of
liability
that
hydrolevel
and
asme
addressed.
first,
hydrolevel
contended
that
on
these
simple
facts,
hardin
and
james
appeared
to
be
acting
as
members
of
the
society,
and
therefore
somehow
they
had
actual
authority
to
join
this
anticompetitive
scheme.
we
argued
to
the
contrary.
in
addition
to
that,
hydrolevel
said,
look,
if
we
are
wrong
about
actual
authority,
later
on,
somehow,
the
society,
with
full
awareness
of
what
was
going
on,
ratified
what
hardin
and
james
were
up
to.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
confront
either
of
those
issues.
they
came
to
an
apparent
authority
analysis
of
this
case,
as
you
know,
and
it
is
something
which
neither
side
did
brief
at
all.
now,
very
briefly,
we
contend
that
whether
we
are
dealing
with
relevant,
appropriate
provisions
of
master
and
servant
law
or
agency
law,
and
furthermore,
if
you
look
at
settled
law
on
what
it
takes
to
have
someone
become
a
member
of
a
combination
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
under
the
sherman
act,
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
just
doesn't
hold
water.
now,
you
will
recall
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
refer
to
in
its
opinion
a
number
of
sections
of
the
restatement
of
agency,
which
they
say
fit
this
case.
it
is
interesting
because
those
sections
in
the
240s,
if
you
look
in
the
table
of
contents
of
the
restatement
of
agency,
it
is
instructive
to
see
that
those
are
regarded
by
the
draftsman
as
dealing
with
specific
and
limited
torts
of
an
agent,
and
thus
permitting
under
certain
circumstances
tying
in
those
agents,
masters,
or
principals.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that's
right.
he--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--well,
i
suppose
that
if
he
by
some
quirk
had
said
something
which
was
obviously
not
in
keeping
with
asme's
rules,
or
in
some
other
fashion
obviously
was
designed
on
its
face
to
help
somebody
in
the
marketplace
unfairly
compete
with
a
competitor,
but
i
don't'
see
how--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--well,
in
the
sense--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--yes.
that
is
fairly
close
to
what
hydrolevel,
i
think,
is
arguing.
my
answer
to
that
is,
for
purposes
of
establishing
treble
damages,
particularly,
under
the
antitrust
laws,
it
cannot
be
said
that
he
would
be
benefitting
his
principal,
writing
a
letter
which
turned
out
to
be
unfair,
incorrect,
or
whatever,
used
against--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--if
you
look
at
section
235
of
the
restatement,
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
deals
with
an
agent
who
intends
not
to
benefit
the
society,
for
example,
in
these
circumstances,
but
somebody
else.
taking
your
hypothetical,
i
suppose
it
could
be
said
that
there,
he
didn't
intend
to
benefit
anybody
outside,
and
since
he
was
doing
his
normal
work
as
a
volunteer,
but
that
leaves
out
the
point
that
you
wouldn't
have
knowing
involvement
in
an
antitrust
conspiracy.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
it
is
insufficient.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
cannot
deny
that
if
that
is
all
that
happened,
he
would
be
performing
in
the
normal
course
in
his
role
at
that
time
as
chairman
of
this
subcommittee,
but
i
think
that
removes
us
from
what
we
have
got
here,
a
suit
for
treble
damages
in
which
the
pleadings
and
the
arguments
of
the
plaintiff
were
that
hydrolevel...
excuse
me,
asme
somehow
became
a
knowing
member
of
a
sherman
act
conspiracy.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
there
was
no
benefit
for
the
principal.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that's
right.
and
we
say--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--we
say
that
that--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--absolutely.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
oh,
yes,
we
do.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
because
the
court
of
appeals
put
the
issue
up
here,
by
saying--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--and
we
say
that
is
wrong.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
no,
we
are
saying...
we
don't
ask
you
to
do
any
more
than
agree
with
us
that
if
you
look
at
this
record--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--and
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
no,
i
was
attempting
to
address
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
fair
enough.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
irrelevant.
if
you
look
at
section
235--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--all
right.
i
will
take
that
trouble
on.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
there
was,
in
every
situation
that
you
can
find
discussing
liability,
justice
white,
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
any
other
case
where
a
plaintiff
is
seeking
more
than
compensatory
damages,
punitive
damages,
exemplary
damages,
there
is
no
case
by
this
court
or
any
lower
federal
court,
including
an
antitrust
case,
that
has
ever
allowed
sherman
act
liability
where
an
employer
obviously
didn't
benefit
if
only
because
the
agents
were
doing
things
like--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--all
right,
and
we
are
saying,
that
is
not
here.
we
are
saying
that
for
a
long
period
of
time,
asme
didn't
even
know
what
hardin
or
james
were
up
to,
and
whatever
they
did
or
didn't
know,
there
was
no
benefit
to
asme
except
this
lawsuit,
which
is
expensive--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--the
court
of
appeals
said
a
little
more
than
that.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
they
are
responsible,
that
is,
the
society,
because
of
the
acts
of
these
two
men,
even
though
they
didn't
know
about
them,
and
even
though
the
society
did
not
benefit,
and
that
involves
a
very
important
principle
of
law.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
ah,
yes.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
i
will
tell
you
why
we
cite
it,
because
in
that
case,
unlike
this
case,
and
there
are
a
number
of
additional
ones
we
cite
of
this
type,
justice
o'connor,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
agents
or
employees
were
doing
in
an
anticompetitive
sense
things
that
they
thought
would
benefit
their
principal.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
standing
alone
on
that
language,
i
understand
you
fully.
but
if
you
will
analyze
the
case
in
its
entirety,
you
will
see,
quite
obviously,
unlike
here,
the
employer
in
question
was
in
commerce,
at
least
in
the
commerce
subject
of
the
case,
and
the
employees
were
acting
in
the
scope
of
their
employment,
doing
the
things
they
shouldn't
have
been
doing
under
the
antitrust
laws.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
kind
of
holding.
this
presents
quite
a
different
case.
here
is
a
society
which
by
statute
and
as
a
practical
matter
is
made
up
of
about
100,000
individuals,
now,
not
companies,
not
firms,
and
here
were
hardin
and
james,
sitting
down
and
agreeing
with
a
commercial
organization,
which
is
a
competitor
of
hydrolevel,
we
can
do
some
things
to
skew
the
procedures
of
the
society
to
help
you
in
the
marketplace.
that
wasn't
done
to
benefit
the
society.
that
is
quite
different
from
the
case
you
cite,
and
others,
hilton
hotels
and
others,
as
you
quite
perceptively
point
out.
we
really
discuss
in
large
measure
both
sides
here,
a
lot
of
these
cases,
but
we
say
that
it
is
important
to
keep
this
distinction
in
mind.
let
me
turn
to
something
else
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
which
standing
alone
the
case
is
still
a
god
case.
you
remember,
they
decided
that
this
turned
on
something
called
the
gleason
case,
which
was
decided
in
the
late
1920s,
and
counsel
for
hydrolevel,
of
course,
understandably
relies
on
that,
and
that
was
a
case
where,
unlike
here,
the
plaintiff
was
seeking
to
recover
compensatory
damages
only
against
a
common
carrier,
where
the
facts
show
very
clearly
that
the
agent
was
really
faithless
to
his
master.
and
there,
this
court
held,
and
we
do
not
quarrel
with
that
holding,
that
for
purposes
of
allocating
risk
of
loss
to
a
plaintiff
like
this,
or
put
differently,
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
be
compensated,
the
principal
would
be
changed
even
though
he
didn't
know
at
the
time
what
the
agent
was
up
to.
however,
we
say
that
this
court
long
ago
recognized
that
distinction
in
a
case
which
oddly
enough
was
handed
down
by
this
court
two
years
after
the
sherman
act
was
passed.
it
is
a
great
case
to
read,
not
just
because
we
think
it
supports
us,
but
because
it
analyzes
both
themes
or
threads
of
authority
in
the
law.
first,
mr.
justice
gray,
writing
for
this
court,
said,
look,
the
law...
he
discussed
for
the
court
the
evolution
of
common
law
in
certain
classes
of
cases
where
to
allocate
the
risk
of
loss
to
somebody's
damage,
the
courts
would
permit
the
imputation
of
liability
for
compensatory
damages
to
such
a
plaintiff,
where
it
was
clear
from
the
record
that
the
principal
didn't
know
what
was
going
on,
and
the
agent
seemed
to
be
seeking
to
benefit
himself
and
not
the
principal.
but
then,
the
case
facing
this
court,
and
it
is
called,
by
the
way,
lake
shore
and
michigan
southern
railway
versus
prentiss...
it
is
in
our
reply
brief...
mr.
justice
gray
said,
but
there
is
another
rule
where
a
plaintiff
goes
further
and
seeks
to
get
exemplary,
deterrent,
or
punitive
damages,
and
there
the
law
is
that
that
plaintiff
will
have
to
show
that
the
principal
of
this
agent
benefitted
from
what
he
was
up
to.
now,
that
seems
to
me
to
go
back
to
what
you
raised,
justice
white,
and
today,
that
case
is
followed
consistently
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
it
is
the
federal
rule,
we
maintain.
therefore,
to
sum
all
this
up,
we
say
that
on
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
about
which
there
is
no
dispute,
here
we
have
a
plaintiff
which
admittedly
had
other
remedies
which
it
abandoned
in
the
court
below
for
suing
asme,
for
example,
for
what
new
york
calls
a
prima
facie
tort,
plaintiff
now
seeking
to
recover
treble
damages
against
this
society,
even
though
the
plaintiff
well
knows
that
the
society
didn't
have
the
requisite
understanding
of
the
sherman
act
cases
to
know
that
an
anticompetitive
scheme
was
going
on,
and
received
no
benefit.
i
notice
my
time
is
up
save
for
rebuttal,
and
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
rebuttal,
let
me
make
a
few
points.
let
me
return
first
of
all
to
something
which
i
think
justice
white
got
into
this
morning,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
clearly
answered
him,
and
i
think
i
should.
we
concede
that
at
the
minimum,
we
are
seeking
to
have
this
court
remand
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
under
what
we
regard
as
the
appropriate
rules
of
antitrust
liability.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
would
have
to
touch
upon
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
but--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--that's
right,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
leads
me
to
my
second
point,
because
as
i
understand
messrs.
schwarz
and
shapiro,
they
continue
to
try
to
argue
that
somehow
we
are
seeking
some
sort
of
antitrust
immunity
or
benefit
that
others
do
not
have
under
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states
because
this
is
a
not
for
profit
organization.
that
is
not
the
case
at
all.
we
wish
to
simply
see
asme
governed
by
the
rules
that
commercial
organizations
or
individuals
are
governed
by,
and
here,
for
example,
what
they
continue
to
do
is
to
say
that
we
want
you
to
somehow
think
that
we
are
standing
the
rule
of
respondeat
superior
on
its
head.
we
are
not.
it
is
very
simple.
let
me
read
you
section
235
in
the
first
comment
thereunder.
it
is
right
here.
it
has
always
been
the
law.
"an
act
of
a
servant
is
not
within
the
scope
of
employment
if
it
is
done
with
no
intention
to
perform
it
as
a
part
of
or
incident
to
a
service
on
account
of
which
he
is
employed.
"
"comment.
"
"the
rule
stated
in
this
section
applies,
although
the
servant
would
be
authorized
to
do
the
very
act
done
if
it
were
done
for
the
purpose
of
serving
the
master,
and
although
outwardly
the
act
appeared
to
be
done
on
the
master's
account.
"
that
puts
it
very
neatly.
in
other
words,
we
admit
that
these
two
men
did
these
things
apparently
cloaked
in
their
role
as
members,
but
that
is
what
this
rule
is
all
about.
let
me
turn
to
another
point
which
i
think
is
very
important,
and
i
think
we
can...
it
is
not
really
another
point,
but
it
illustrates
the
perniciousness
of
this
argument
that
somehow
we
should
be
bound
in
this
kind
of
a
case
on
these
facts.
like
i
assume
many
of
us
here,
i
am
a
member
of
the
bar
association,
the
city
bar
of
new
york.
i
am
an
officer.
i
am
a
member
of
the
executive
committee,
and
thus
i
would
have
power
to
go
to,
let's
say,
the
ethics
committee
in
that
bar
association,
and
because
i
wanted
to
serve
my
law
firm,
not
the
bar
association,
i
saw
a
chance
to
diminish
a
competing
firm
which
had
a
very
juicy
client
if
i
could
skew
up
an
opinion
of
the
ethics
committee
dealing
with
the
behavior
of
that
law
firm.
i
would
think
we
would
all
agree,
no
one
would
want
to
say
that
the
city
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
liable
for
my
faithless
conduct.
i
wasn't
acting
for
them.
i
was
using
their
authority
in
a
very
real
sense.
i
was
masquerading
using
their
trappings,
their
building,
my
role
as
an
officer,
and
so
on.
but
no
one
would
think
i...
i
hope
we
would
all
agree...
that
the
city
bar
would
be
liable
just
because
i
did
something
awful.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
hope
they
would
agree.
they
are
members
of
the
bar
association.
maybe
not
the
city
bar
of
new
york.
i
turn
to
my
third
point.
mr.
schwarz
is
just
wrong
when
he
says
that
lake
shore
and
michigan
southern
railway
is
no
longer
good
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
panel
in
this
case
cited,
albeit
on
a
slightly
different
point,
they
cited
a
case
which
upholds
lake
shore,
discusses
it.
it
is
the
united
states
versus
the
ridgely
bank
case.
our
own
main
brief
and
reply
brief
discuss
other
cases,
including
cases
in
the
second
circuit
of
very
recent
vintage,
which
recognize
that
1892
decision
by
this
court
is
still
good
law.
another
point.
i
turn
to
this
argument
which
mr.
shapiro
made
here
this
morning...
the
government
brief
i
think
also
casts
it
up...
suggesting
that
asme
and
similarly
situated
voluntary
member
societies
have
enormous
power.
i
think
he
uses
the
phrase
"economic
power",
or
whatever
kind
of
coercive
power.
well,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
asme
can
go
around
recklessly
avoiding
its
purposes
and
its
duties
to
with
whom
it
ever
deals,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
real
power
only
comes
to
asme's
codes
and
standards
when
a
government
like
mr.
shapiro's
and
my
federal
government
adopts
those
standards,
or
the
states,
or
the
provinces
of
canada.
that
is
when
the
real
coercive
power.
and
this
is
an
interesting
thing
in
another
way.
if
you
will
notice
in
the
record,
the
joint
appendix...
i
think
it
appears
at
79...
of
just
what
happened
here,
after
hydrolevel
complained
to
asme,
after
april
of
1971,
about
this
letter,
which
of
course,
as
you
know,
very
importantly
never
mentioned
hydrolevel
at
all,
hydrolevel
complained.
there
was
a
swift
response,
which
again
mr.
schwarz
tries
to
tell
you
never
occurred
and
never
does
even
now.
it
occurred
right
in
this
case.
on
may
4
and
5
of
1972,
in
st.
paul,
minnesota,
for
two
days,
all
kinds
of
people
came
in
and
on
the
docket
was
the
complaint
of
hydrolevel.
thereafter,
contrary
to
what
he
insinuates
even
here
today,
the
final
june
9th,
'72,
letter
was
circularized
to
300.
he
tries
to
suggest
it
is
less,
but
the
record
is
clear,
300
persons.
but
finally,
if
you
will
notice
who
was
shown
in
the
record
to
be
in
those
meetings,
it
is
very
important
to
the
government
point,
there
were
government
people
present.
you
will
see
on
79
what
are
called
conference
members.
these
are
men
clearly
identified,
and
women,
who
are
officials
of
state
governments,
who
were
there
listening,
and
the
reason,
of
course,
is,
these
were
regulatory
officials
whose
states
had
adopted
some
form
or
another
of
a
code
or
standard
put
forth
by
asme.
so,
it
is
just
not
so
that
asme
has
been
recklessly
and
indifferently
careening
around
the
landscape
of
america--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--that
is
why
i
didn't
get
into
it
initially.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
get
the
point.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
it
has.
thank
you
very
much.
