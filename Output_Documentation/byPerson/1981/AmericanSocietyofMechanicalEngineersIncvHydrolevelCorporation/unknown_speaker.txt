unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
might
i
ask
you,
mr.
tyler,
whether
it
isn't
true
that
the
trial
court
instructed
on
quite
a
different
standard
than
apparent
authority?
unknown
speaker
you
have
no
quarrel
with
the
trial
court's
instructions
or
the
results
thereof?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
did
not
review
the
record
in
terms
of
those
instructions?
unknown
speaker
but
you
want
us
to.
if
you
ask
us
to
reverse,
we
would...
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
was
wrong,
the
basis
for
his
decision
was
wrong,
in
order
to
reverse,
we
would
have
to
then
review
the
record
ourselves.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
except
that
the
jury
found
against
you.
unknown
speaker
except
that
the
jury
found
against
you.
unknown
speaker
and
so
somebody
would
have
to
say
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
arrive
at
that
position
on
the
record.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know
you
do.
mr.
tyler,
don't
you
run
the
risk,
if
you
ask
us
to
look
at
the
record...
say
we
agreed
with
your
legal
theory...
that
we
might
look
at
it
and
say,
yes,
there
is
enough
evidence
here
to
support
the
jury
finding,
and
therefore
affirm
on
a
different
basis?
you
only
have
one
shot.
unknown
speaker
you
are
willing
to
take
that
risk.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tyler,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question
that
troubles
me
a
little
bit?
i
think
the
predicate
of
your
argument
is
that
hardin
did
not
benefit
asme
at
all
when
he
answered
the
phoney
letter
of
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
letter
had
not
been
a
phoney,
but
had
been
a
routine
inquiry,
and
he
had
answered
it
in
a
routine
fashion.
would
he
then
have
benefitted
asme?
unknown
speaker
is
the
function
of
a
person
in
his
capacity
of
answering
letters
of
inquiry,
does
that
provide
any
benefit
to
his
principal?
unknown
speaker
supposing
it
is
an
innocent
letter,
a
routine
inquiry,
do
you
have
a
code
that
applies
to
cutoff
valves.
he
writes
back
and
says,
yes,
we
do,
the
section
number
is
so
and
so.
does
that
benefit--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
does
the
question
of
whether
he
was
benefitting
his
principal
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
and
the
nature
of
the
response?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
the
benefit
is
insufficient,
but
it
seems
to
me
that--
unknown
speaker
--answering
mail
for
a
principal
does
provide
at
least
the
benefit
of
getting
the
letter
off
the
desk
and
getting
it
answered.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
tyler,
aren't
you...
did
you
really
want
to
make
this
jury
speech
here?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
threshold
submission
is
that
this
case
should
be
judged
on
the
basis
that
let's
assume
that
there
was
no
benefit,
that
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
have
cared
less
whatever
there
was
benefit
or
not,
so
we
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
there
was
no
benefit
for
the
principal.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
whether
there
was
or
not,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide.
they
said,
even
if
there
is
no
benefit
for
the
principal
whatsoever,
the
principal
is
liable.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
want
to--
unknown
speaker
--you
want
us
to
reverse
that.
unknown
speaker
and
so
we
don't
have
to
get
into
an
argument
about
whether
there
was
or
wasn't
benefit,
writing
this
letter.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
you--
unknown
speaker
--no,
they
said
even
if
there
is
no
benefit,
the
principal
is
liable.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
then
you
want
us
also
to
go
on
and
say
there
was
no
benefit.
unknown
speaker
i
thought,
if
the
case
comes
here,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
even
if
there
is
no
benefit,
the
principal
is
liable.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
you
don't
have
to
argue
then
whether
the
letter
was
a
benefit
or
not.
you
just
assume
that
it
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
he
just
picked
you
up
on
an
argument
that
you
were
making
that
there
was
no
benefit--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
irrelevant
to
your
first
submission.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
have
to
convince
me
that
there
was
no
benefit
here
in
order
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
you
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
trouble.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
don't
bother
for
now.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
said,
even
if
there
was
no
benefit,
they
are
liable.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tyler,
you
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
support
of
your
argument,
including
something
called
united
states
versus
american
radiator
and
standard
sanitary
corporation,
in
which
we
had
denied
cert.
that
was
apparently
an
antitrust
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
spoke
as
follows:
"a
corporation
is
legally
bound
by
the
acts
and
statements
of
its
agents
done
or
made
within
the
scope
of
their
employment
of
their
apparent
authority.
"
unknown
speaker
and
it
goes
on
and
says,
"when
the
act
of
the
agent
is
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
or
his
apparent
authority,
the
corporation
is
held
legally
responsible
for
it.
"
i
didn't
understand
why
you
cited
it.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
the
language
which
i
read
you
of
the
opinion
would
indicate
that
the
court
would
not
share
your
view.
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
are
undoubtedly
entitled
to
make
that
sort
of
a
presentation,
i
take
it
you
are
suggesting
that
the
court,
if
it
disagrees
with
you
and
agrees
with
your
opponent,
wouldn't
be
free
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
second
circuit
for
evaluation
of
those
two
points?
unknown
speaker
were
you
satisfied
at
the
time
with
the
instructions
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
and
he
turned
it
down?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
appeal
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
no,
because
you
won.
0
[generallaughter.]
which
is
not
a
bad
result.
unknown
speaker
and
whether
they
did
or
did
not
in
fact
benefit
them?
is
that
a
factor?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
lake
shore
case,
relied
upon
by
your
opponent?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
fair
body
of
law,
though,
isn't
there,
in
all
fields
that
says
that
where
you
seek
to
assess
either
punitive
or
treble
damages,
you
are
held
to
a
higher
test
than
where
you
are
merely
talking
about
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwarz,
are
you
saying
that
the
criminal
prosecution
would
not
lie
against
asme
on
these
facts?
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
your
distinction?
unknown
speaker
was
that
before
or
after
the
gypsum
case
that
this
court
decided
a
few
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
the
antitrust
context
it
would
survive
gypsum?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
novel
about
that,
do
you
think,
in
voluntary
organizations,
whether
it
is
the
american
bar
association
or
the
society
of
engineers?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
the
question
of
whether
the
organization
operates
that
way
or
that
some
people
within
those
organizations
operate
that
way?
unknown
speaker
so
they
must
police
the
conduct
of
every
individual
member
of
the
organization?
unknown
speaker
you
use
the
term
regulation.
you
mean
the
letter,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
when
you
said
earlier
there
should
be
notice
and
public
comment
before
regulations
are
adopted,
do
you
mean
that
before
any
letter
is
written,
too?
unknown
speaker
should
be
proceeded
by
notice
and
public
hearing?
unknown
speaker
they've
got
a
lot
of
mail
to
answer,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
require
a
public
hearing
before
a
telephone
call
is
answered?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
simple
change
you
say
would
solve
this
problem
for
the--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
schwarz,
when
you
say
fully
supports
the
verdict
you
are
talking
about
the
verdict
as
to
liability,
not
as
to
damages?
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
cross
appeal
from
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
from
the
second
circuit's.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest
that
there
was
anything
inappropriate
about
counsel
for
one
of
the
parties
drafting
a
proposed
instruction,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
accepted
their
version
rather
than
some
other
version
submitted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
more
in
favor
of
an
apparent
authority
proposition
than
the
brief
that
you
submitted
appeared
to.
are
you
taking
a
stronger
position
today
on
that?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
apparent
authority
is
sufficient
for
liability
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
there
a
difference
in
those
approaches
on
whether
it
is
an
organization
created
for
a
profit,
a
conventional
manufacturing
institution,
or
an
organization
like
this?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
be
necessarily
the
complete
answer,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
is
your
argument
directed
solely
to
organizations
such
as
this
that
promulgate
standards?
suppose
this
society
did
not
promulgate
codes
or
standards.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
so
your
emphasis
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
does
not
affect
your
basic
position
or
limit
it.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
agree
with
your
associate
that
not
only
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
a
standard
or
code,
but
even
with
respect
to
giving
of
an
opinion
letter,
that
there
should
be
due
process
hearing?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
be
a
great
defense,
i
don't
suppose,
if
two
people
conspired,
two
of
the
officers
conspired,
and
this
is
a
tenable
construction
of
the
regulation
which
we
will
publish,
or
it
is
an
untenable
one
but
we
will
publish
it
anyway.
unknown
speaker
it
lets
people
know
that
they
ought
to
start
thinking
about
the
antitrust
laws.
unknown
speaker
in
which
event,
if
we
did
just
that,
we
wouldn't
have
to
touch
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
benefit
to
the
company.
unknown
speaker
we
would
say
that...
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
even
if
there
was
no
benefit,
that
there
was
liability,
and
we
would
have
to
say
that
was
wrong,
if
we
agreed
with
you.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
no
one,
do
you
include
your
people
on
the
other
side?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tyler,
if
your
legal
theory
is
correct,
you
didn't
have
to
hold
that
meeting
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wonder
why
you
got
into
it
now.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
point
has
expired.
