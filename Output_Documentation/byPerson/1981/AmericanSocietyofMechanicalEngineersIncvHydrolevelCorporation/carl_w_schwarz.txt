mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
appeal
is
from
a
jury
verdict
finding
the
defendant,
asme,
liable
for
treble
damages
under
both
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act,
a
verdict
rendered
upon
instructions
from
the
trial
judge
that
are
not
being
challenged
on
appeal,
as
we
have
just
heard.
indeed,
the
jury's
conclusion
that
the
law
was
violated
is
also
not
being
challenged,
but
is
expressly
conceded
by
the
asme.
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
asme,
as
a
corporation,
is
to
be
held
responsible
under
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
for
the
damage
caused
by
that
violation.
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
would
like
to
make
two
observations
at
the
outset.
first,
there
were
two
physical
exhibits
introduced
at
the
trial,
the
two
devices
in
question.
we
have
brought
them
here
so
that
the
court
can
see.
this
is
the
probe;
this
is
the
float.
i
need
not
go
into
the
description
of
how
they
work.
they
are
adequately
covered
in
the
briefs.
the
second
observation
i
would
like
to
make
at
the
outset
involves
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
that
were
filed
on
behalf
of
hydrolevel.
the
brief
of
adolph
ackerman,
who
is
an
asme
member,
and
one
of
the
amicus
curiae,
developed
in
his
brief,
one
which
i
highly
recommend
to
the
court,
that
the
asme's
presentation
in
this
court
totally
fails
to
address
two
principles
that
are
basic
to
agency
law,
and
that
should
be
most
important
to
every
professional,
and
particularly
the
professional
societies
that
administer
standards
that
have
the
force
of
law.
those
two
principles
are
duty
and
responsibility.
those
that
assume
a
great
responsibility
should
have
a
corresponding
great
duty,
not
only
to
hydrolevel
for
fair
treatment,
not
only
to
the
public
at
large
for
setting
standards
that
promote
competition
and
do
not
entrench
monopolists,
but
to
itself
and
its
own
members,
as
mr.
ackerman
points
out.
i
listened
in
vain
to
my
brother's
presentation
and
the
words
"duty"
and
"responsibility"
were
never
mentioned.
the
case
as
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
involved
only
the
question,
as
my
brother
has
pointed
out,
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
jury's
conclusion
that
the
asme's
agents
were
at
least
in
part,
at
least
in
part,
acting
on
behalf
of
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
asme,
or
secondly,
whether
the
asme
by
its
subsequent
acts
and
statements
or
failures
to
act
ratified
the
unlawful
activity.
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
these
two
questions,
because
it
decided
that
a
third
principle
of
respondeat
superior,
that
of
apparent
authority,
had
clearly
been
satisfied,
and
justified
the
imposition
of
liability.
i
would
like
in
my
presentation
first
to
explain
why
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
and
then
to
demonstrate
why
there
are
two
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance,
that
of
actual
authority
with
intent
to
benefit
and
ratification,
and
i
note
in
this
respect
that
this
is
one
point
on
which
my
brother
and
i
are
in
full
agreement,
that
these
issues
should
be
addressed
by
the
court.
he
said
so.
i
say
so.
and
i
believe
we
are
entitled
to
address
them
both
under
the
questions
presented
under
which
this
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted,
which,
if
you
care
to
look
at
them,
at
the
front
of
the
brief
of
my
opponent,
raise
and
involve
the
questions
of
actual
authority
and
ratification,
and
under
the
doctrine
of
the
two
cases,
dandridge
versus
williams
and
dayton
versus
brinkman,
which
permit,
i
believe,
a
respondent
to
urge
affirmance
on
any
ground,
even
though
it
is
not
specifically
addressed,
although
in
this
case
it
is.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
of
course,
your
honor,
it
would
be
free
to
do
so.
i
would
suggest,
with
due
respect,
that
it
should
not
do
so.
i
should
think
that
after
the
case
has
been
fully
briefed
on
those
issues,
in
this
court,
has
been
argued,
as
we
have
just
heard.
the
record
is
before
this
court.
i
should
think
that
conditions
of
judicial
economy
would
require,
and
i
would
suggest
with
due
respect
indicate
that
those
issues
should
be
looked
at
and
that
the
jury
verdict
should
be
affirmed
and
reinstated
in
all
respects.
i
will
get
to
my--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--your
honor,
we
were
not
satisfied.
we
asked
the
district
court
judge
to
give
an
instruction
on
apparent
authority
that
did
not
include
a
requirement
of
benefit.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
and
he
turned
it
down.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
we
did
not
appeal
on
that
ground.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
your
honor,
on
the
asme's
challenge
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
apparent
authority,
it
really
is
on
two
levels.
first,
it
argues
that
because
the
doctrine
of
apparent
authority
does
not
require
an
intent
to
benefit,
which
all
agree
is
the
case,
even
though
the
asme
suggested
a
charge
to
the
jury
which
the
district
court
adopted
to
the
contrary,
that
that
doctrine
should
not
be
available
in
any
antitrust
case,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
argued
that
it
should
not
be
available
in
any
case
with
even
arguably
punitive
aspects.
it
is,
the
argument
goes,
somehow
unfair
to
punish
the
principal
for
acts
of
dishonest
or
disloyal
agents
where
those
acts
were
not
intentionally
authorized
by
or
known
to
the
principal,
and
where
those
acts
were
not
intended
to
benefit
the
principal
by
the
disloyal
agent.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
apparent
agency
issue,
apparent
authority
issue,
i
think
all
agree
now
that
the
issue
of
benefit
is
not
relevant.
whether
there
was
benefit
or
no
benefit,
the
important
thing,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
at
some
length,
is
whether
there
was
an
aura
of
agency
and
authority
imposed
upon
the
agent
by
the
principal
which
was
relied
upon
by
third
parties
to
the
detriment
in
this
case
of
hydrolevel.
now,
i
submit
that
if
this
court
accepts
that
argument,
it
would
be
rejecting
the
very
reasons
for
the
existence
and
development
of
the
law
of
respondeat
superior.
it
would
be
overturning
decades
of
settled
law,
and
that
law
has
never
made
any
exceptions
to
the
application
of
respondeat
superior
law
or
the
law
of
agency
to
particular
cases
such
as
this.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
your
honor,
that
lake
shore
case,
with
all
due
respect,
says
that
a
corporation
cannot
be
assessed
with
damages
that
are
punitive
unless
the
president
or
general
manager
knew
of
in
advance
and
approved
those...
in
that
case,
i
believe,
a
conductor
beat
up
a
passenger...
those
acts
in
advance.
i
suggest
with
all
due
respect
that
that
case
has
not
been
followed.
i
suggest
that
in
effect,
that
is
the
general
electric
defense
in
the
antitrust
cases.
mr.
cordon
didn't
know
what
was
going
on.
he
didn't
approve
of
it.
i
think
that
case
is
no
longer
being
followed,
in
that
respect.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
your
honor,
i
believe
you
may
have
reference
to
the
standard
oil
of
texas
case,
which
our
opponents
have
made
a
great
point
of
in
their
brief.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
case
and
that
line
of
cases
in
one
respect.
those
cases
relied
basically
upon
the
assumption,
or
those
cases
that
i
am
thinking
of
relied
basically
on
the
assumption
that
there
has
to
be
a
specific
intent
involved
in
the
very
violation.
in
that
case,
for
example,
there
was
a
statute
at
issue
which
required
knowing
and
wilful
violation
of
that
statute.
in
that
case,
the
two
disloyal
and
dishonest
agents
were
stealing
from
the
principal,
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
the
government
was
arguing
that
the
intent,
the
dishonest
intent
of
the
two
employees
that
were
stealing
from
the
principal
should
be
imputed
to
the
principal
for
purposes
of
criminal
prosecution
of
the
principal.
in
those
circumstances,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
is
not
the
result
that
should
follow.
our
case,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
sherman
act
case.
the
sherman
act,
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
do
not
require
a
specific
intent.
the
statute
is
violated
as
this
court
has
held
so
many
times
with
an
act
that
has
the
purpose
or
effect--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--no,
sir.
i
am
not
saying
that.
i
suspect--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--well,
i
want
to
point
the
court's
attention
to
the
a&p
trucking
case.
in
the
united
states
versus
a&p
trucking,
this
court
held,
and
that,
i
might
point
out,
was
also
a
criminal
case,
and
this
is
why
i
do
believe
that
the
lake
shore
case,
even
though
it
has
not
been
expressly
overruled,
is
no
longer
valid,
the
a&p
trucking
case
said,
and
i
quote,
"it
is
elementary
that
such
impersonal
entities.
"
referring
to
corporations,
"can
be
guilty
of
"knowing"
or
wilful
violations
of
regulatory
statutes
through
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior.
"
that
was
a
criminal
case,
your
honor.
i
do
suggest--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--that
was
before.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
think
gypsum
expressly
stated
basically
the
same
concept.
now,
the
doctrine
of
apparent
authority,
like
the
law
of
agency
as
a
whole,
is
really
bottomed
on
one
premise,
and
that
is
that
a
person
who
extends
his
power
and
influence
by
utilizing
others
to
do
his
work
should
be
responsible
for
the
damage
caused
in
the
course
of
doing
that
work.
in
an
actual
authority
situation,
the
principal
is
bound
by
the
exercise
of
authority
he
actually
gives
to
the
agent.
in
an
apparent
authority
situation,
the
principal
is
bound
by
the
exercise
of
authority
he
represents
to
the
world
that
the
agent
has.
the
two
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
an
agent
may
and
frequently
does
have
both
actual
and
apparent
authority
from
the
principal,
and
that,
we
submit,
is
exactly
what
is
in
this
case.
even
the
doctrine
of
inherent
agency
power,
which
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
requires
no
specific
authority
at
all.
in
neither
of
those
cases,
actual
of
apparent
authority,
is
the
principal
bound
on
a
theory
of
negligence,
except
insofar
as
he
has
made
a
poor
choice
of
agents.
in
both
cases,
the
principal
is
bound
by
his
own
act
of
conferring
actual
or
apparent
authority.
now,
apparent
authority
is
not,
as
the
asme
would
have
this
court
believe,
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
respondeat
superior.
fraud
and
the
other
torts
that
were
mentioned
by
my
brother
during
his
presentation
is
no
less
a
conventional
tort
than
assault,
and
i
submit
that
apparent
authority
is
designed
and
has
always
been
a
part
of
the
law
of
respondeat
superior
simply
to
take
into
account
those
types
of
torts
where
it
can
most
commonly
occur.
that
rule
of
apparent
authority
has
been
around
as
long
as
the
sherman
act.
if
congress
had
intended
that
corporations
or
non-profit
associations
were
to
be
liable
only
for
anticompetitive
acts
expressly
authorized
or
ratified
by
the
board
of
directors
of
a
corporation,
or
intended
to
benefit
the
corporation,
it
could
have
easily
done
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
fact
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
so
basic
to
this
country's
economy
makes
it
that
much
more
important
that
the
courts
not
remove
any
legal
incentive
for
antitrust
vigilance
on
behalf
of
industry.
the
second
level
of
the
asme's
argument
on
apparent
authority
is
that
even
if
apparent
authority
is
applied
to
other
corporations,
industrial
corporations,
it
should
be
not
available
against
non-profit
corporations
such
as
the
asme,
because
they
are
organized
only
to
do
good
things
for
the
public,
and
they
should
not
have
to
bear
the
terrible
financial
risks
that
the
antitrust
laws
impose.
i
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
any
special
treatment
for
any
class
of
persons,
and
the
definition
of
persons
in
the
sherman
and
the
clayton
acts
clearly
encompasses
non-profit
as
well
as
even
eleemosynary
institutions
such
as
churches
and
others.
i
suggest
that
the
opposite
is
true.
it
is
more
important
to
continue
the
apparent
authority
concept
in
effect
against
non-profit
corporations
because
otherwise
they
would
be
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
altogether.
the
proposition
advanced
by
my
opposition
that
everything
done
by
the
asme
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
public,
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
asme,
means
that
it
could
never
be
held
responsible
for
any
unlawful
act
except
through
an
apparent
authority
concept
or
by
direct
ratification.
i
would
like
to
address
one
point
that
i
think
is
important
from
the
context
of
the
brief
of
the
other
side.
it
is
said
frequently,
what
could
we
have
done
to
avoid
this?
we
have
10,000
people
writing
codes,
100,000
members.
what
could
the
asme
have
done
to
avoid
what
happened
to
hydrolevel?
the
asme
suggests
that
it
is
being
asked
to
pay
astronomical
damages
for
something
caused
by
only
two
disloyal
agents.
i
submit
that
very
few
basic
changes
in
the
way
they
do
business
would
protect
the
asme
quite
nicely,
and
at
the
same
time
purge
the
organization
of
those
volunteers
like
john
james
who
are
serving
the
asme
only
because
of
the
influence
they
can
extract
from
it
on
behalf
of
their
employers.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
your
honor,
i
am
not
familiar
enough
with
all
of
the
voluntary
organizations
in
this
country
to
give
you
an
honest
and
accurate
answer.
i
suggest
that
we
are
looking
at
the
asme.
i
realize
that
there
are
numerous
other
organizations
that
have
filed
amicus
briefs,
but
that
is
a
question,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
is
most
appropriately
addressed
to
congress.
if
there
are
hundreds
of
organizations
out
there
that
operate
differently
from
the
asme,
i
suggest
that
they
are
in
no
danger.
if
there
are
hundreds
out
there
that
operate
like
the
asme,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
they
are,
unless
they
change.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
i
would
say
the
former,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in
this
case--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--i
suggest
that
they
have
to
police
the
conduct
of
those
individuals
to
whom
they
delegate
codemaking
responsibility
that
has
the
ability
and
the
chance
to
put
people
out
of
business.
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
they
should
provide
a
public
hearing,
an
opportunity
for
notice
and
comment
for
regulations
that
are
put
out
like
this
interpretation.
i
think
that
was
required
by
this
court's
opinion
in
silver.
i
think
they
should
choose
their
agents
better.
they
shouldn't
put
the
fox
in
with
the
chickens,
just
like
the
asme
did
in
this
case.
i
think
that
certain
and
meaningful
discipline
for
those
who
abuse
the
trust
of
the
organization
would
deter
such
abuse
in
the
future.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
john
james
to
my
knowledge
to
this
very
day
has
never
been
disciplined,
and
that
the
court
should
note
that
asme
has
defended
his
activities
right
through
the
day
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
it
only
began
to
call
john
james
disloyal,
perfidious,
and
dishonest
after
the
jury
found
there
was
a
violation
of
law.
they
told
the
jury
that
that
regulation
was
correct.
they
told
the
jury
that
it
was
issued
in
the
normal
course
of
their
activities.
is
it
any
wonder
that--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--the
letter.
the
interpretation.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
any
interpretation
of
a
code.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
your
honor,
i
think
the
asme--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--they
have
said...
they
have
said
that
there
are
10,000
opportunities
or
inquiries
every
year.
they
have
not
told
the
court,
but
most
of
those
are
by
telephone.
that
is
in
the
record.
most
of
those--
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
they
are
required
by
this
court's
opinion
in
silver
to
give
due
process,
notice,
opportunity
to
comment
when
a
code
that
has
the
force
of
law
is
being
interpreted
and
amended.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
they
had
given
hydrolevel
the
opportunity
and
notice
to
comment
on
that
letter
before
it
went
out,
this
case
never
would
have
come
up.
with
all
due
respect,
i
would
like
to
quickly
go
to
the
two
alternative
grounds
before
my
time
expires.
the
record
fully
supports
the
verdict
on
the
ground
of
actual
authority
with
intent
to
benefit.
the
asme's
trial
strategy,
as
i
have
just
pointed
out,
treated
the
jury
to
a
barrage
of
testimony
and
judicial
admissions
to
the
effect
that
the
interpretation,
the
letter
was
accurate,
proper,
issued
in
full
accordance
with
the
asme's
procedures,
and
asme
stood
by
it.
in
the
face
of
those
admissions,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
jury
not
to
have
concluded
that
it
was
issued
on
behalf
of
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
asme.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
your
honor,
yes,
i
am
speaking
of
liability.
the
damage
verdict
of
the
jury
was
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals
based
upon
their
reading
of
the
june
9th
letter,
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to
right
now.
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
from
the
jury's
verdict
on
damages?
mr.
carl
w.
schwarz
no,
your
honor.
well,
we
did
file
a
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
still
pending
before
this
court,
number
1711,
that
addresses
the
damage
question.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
on
the
subject
of
damages
is
closely
interrelated
with
their
opinion
on
the
subject
of
liability
through
the
vehicle
of
the
june
9th,
1972,
letter.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
letter
was
a
retraction
of
the
original
interpretation.
we
say
it
was
an
affirmance,
it
was
an
adoption,
it
was
a
ratification
of
that
original
letter.
that
june
9th
letter
was
also
written
in
part
by
john
james.
that
june
9th
letter
never
specifically
said
that
the
original
letter
was
not
correct.
that
june
9th
letter
closed
with
cautionary
language
that
john
james
specifically
said
was
a
limitation
on
the
ability
of
a
company
to
have
a
time
delay
meet
the
code.
and,
that
june
9th,
1972,
letter
was
never
sent
to
anyone
except
hydrolevel.
it
corrected
nothing.
i
notice
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
