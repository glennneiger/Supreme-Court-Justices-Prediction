unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
your
case
from
the
first
national
bank
v.
bellotti?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
the
limits
were
much
higher;
for
instance,
$5000
instead
of
$250?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
so
much
the
public's
right
to
know
as
it
is
their
right
to
express
what
they
think?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
doesn't
communicate
very
much,
your
position
would
be
it's
still
a
right,
even
if
they
present
such
a
muddled
message
that
no
one
gets
it.
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
grant
any
quid
quo
pro
like
limited
liability
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
first
national
bank
of
boston
v.
bellotti
here?
is
the
liability
of
members
of
the
carc
limited
in
the
way
that
the
members
of
a
corporation
are?
unknown
speaker
they
would
be
liable
for
acts
of
their
agents
and
for
the
same,
just
as
an
individual,
and
they
would
not
have
corporate
immunity.
unknown
speaker
no,
carc,
or
your
citizens
against
rent
control.
they
would
be
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
association,
that's
correct.
although
it
would
frankly
be
unlikely
that
they
would
be
held
responsible
for
such
acts.
but
that's
as
a
matter
of
likelihood
of
the
acts
taking
place,
rather
than
any
principle
of
law
that
insulates
them
from
acts
of
individuals.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
a
lot
of
your
arguments,
counsel,
are
equally
applicable
to
candidate
campaigns.
but
you're
stressing
really
the
ballot
measures.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
california
supreme
court
purported
to
find
a
compelling
interest,
or
several
of
them.
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
their
views?
unknown
speaker
and
avoids
the
appearance
of
money
dominating
the
campaign.
that's
the
same...
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
saying
that
the
first
amendment
and
our
cases
just
foreclose
using
those
interests
as
a
compelling
interest.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
think
our
cases?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
bellotti
wasn't
a
contribution
case,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
involved
was
expenditures,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
big
argument
in
the
case
was
whether
business
entities
could
spend
money
on
matters
in
which
their
property
interests
or
corporate
interests
weren't
directly
involved.
and
certainly,
the
berkeley
ordinance
doesn't
prevent
expenditures
by
corporations
or
individuals
in
any
amount,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
it
just
isn't
covered
by
bellotti.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
tell
me
whether
this
committee,
when
it
received
money,
could
independently
determine
how
to
spend
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
what
it
said
and
the
particular
content
is
decided
by
the
committee.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
run
it
by
any
contributor
to
see
if
he
agrees
with
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
about
this
one.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
it
was
the
committee's
decision,
not
the
contributors'.
unknown
speaker
or
support
it.
unknown
speaker
it
was
organized
to
defeat
it.
that's
correct.
i
know,
but
the
particular
content
of
the
communications
were
decided
by
the
committee.
unknown
speaker
was
it
proposition
13
that
related
to
the
tax
limitation
in
your
state--
unknown
speaker
--and
these
limits
would
apply
on
that
kind
of
a
referendum,
too,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
speaking
of
the
principle
underlying
this
particular
measure
would
have
barred
individual
citizens
from
contributing
over
$250.
unknown
speaker
would
this
argument
apply
to
restrict
a
newspaper
from
having
an
editorial,
the
space
of
which
would
cost
more
than
$250
for
advertising
purposes?
or
would
it
restrict
a
local
broadcaster
from
editorializing
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
usually,
editorials
of
the
newspaper,
depending
on
the
size
of
it,
represent
the
collective
views
of
anywhere
from
two
or
three
to
a
half
a
dozen
or
more
people.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
always
ask
the
attorneys
what
they
mean
by
the
word
compelling.
unknown
speaker
you
used
the
word
again,
and
i
merely
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
it
isn't
awfully
easy
to
fall
into
the
habit
of
using
a
word
that
dictates
the
result.
and
i
feel
a
little
more
comfortable
if
we
didn't
use
the
word
compelling,
whatever
that
means.
unknown
speaker
you
just
say
it's
a
strong
enough
interest,
it's
just
an
interest
that's
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
interest
on
the
other
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
all
it
really
is?
if
it
overrides
it,
it's
compelling.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
defined
the
term
compelling
and
the
phrase
"compelling
interest"?
i
think
the
answer
is
probably
no.
it
made
its
first
venture
into
the
law
books
in
the
case
of
kramer
v.
union
free
school
district,
did
it
not,
without
any
explanation?
unknown
speaker
but
you
know
of
many
cases
where
this
court
has
used
the
term?
unknown
speaker
does
it
mean
the
same
thing
as
fixed
scrutiny?
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
restricted
by
the
contributions,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
spend
more
than
you
receive?
unknown
speaker
the
voice
can
only
be
as
loud
and
as
pervasive
as
the
contributions
permit.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
fly
in
the
face
of
one
of
the
rationales
of
our
buckley
v.
valeo
opinion,
that
in
order
to
have
more
different
voices
heard,
we
would
suppress...
at
least
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
here...
we
would
suppress
some
voices
in
order
that
more
could
be
heard?
unknown
speaker
except
in
your
first
example,
you
would
have
to
agree
with
your
friend
as
to
the
form
of
the
advertisement,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
ms.
west,
under
that
argument,
would
it
comply
with
the
ordinance
for
a
$5000
contributor
to
say,
i
want
to
approve
all
the
advertising
that
you
disseminate,
and
then
they
let
him
do
it.
in
exchange
for
$5000
he
gets
a
veto
on
the
advertisement.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
joint
expenditure?
unknown
speaker
let's
say
he
gets
all
those
controls
in
exchange
for
$5000--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
it's
clear
under
the
ordinance
that
my
suggestion
would
be
acceptable
to
the
city
fathers?
unknown
speaker
if
the
$5000
contributors
all
get
together
and
say
we
have
the
right
not
only
to
just
put
the
money
in
the
pool,
but
also,
we
want
to
pass
on
the
time,
place
and
the
forum
of
all
publications.
then
they
would
say
it's
all
right?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it's
clear
that
the
city
fathers
would
so
interpret
their
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
now
are
you
talking
about
the
definition
in
buckley
or
the
definition
in
the
berkeley
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
asking
about
what
the
ordinance
means.
i
had
not
understood
that
the
city
would
permit
a
$5,000
contributor
to
make
a
contribution
in
that
amount
provided
he
insisted
on
control
over
the...
over,
you
know...
approval
of
the
message
that
was--
unknown
speaker
--well,
all
of
these
things.
but
is
it
clear--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you're
telling
me
what
buckley
holds.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
you're
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
so
construe
the
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
not
my
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
would
approve
of
$5000
contributions
as
you
just
described
them?
unknown
speaker
ms.
west,
do
you
agree
that
the
test
to
be
applied
for
its
validity
is
a
strict
scrutiny
test?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
the
ordinance
would
fail
the
so-called
strict
scrutiny
test?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
want
as
much
diversity
as
possible.
how
many
newspapers
do
you
have
in
berkeley?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
both
combine
on
one
issue
on
one
side.
don't
you
need
a
whole
lot
to
counteract
that?
but
don't
you
need
more
than
$250
to
counteract
that?
unknown
speaker
ms.
west,
my
problem
is
that
in
1981
$250
would
buy
one
bumper
sticker,
wouldn't
it,
about?
i
don't
think
it
would
even
buy
the
glue
for
the
bumper
stickers,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
$250
is
just
about...
it
isn't
even
walking
around
money.
unknown
speaker
ms.
west,
can't
the
city
accomplish
that
just
as
easily
and
far
less
restrictively
by
just
saying
that
anytime
you
contribute
to
a
group
or
a
fund,
that
you
have
to
disclose
who
the
contributors
really
are?
i
mean,
that's
far
less
restrictive,
is
it
not,
than
the
berkeley
ordinance
we,
in
fact,
have?
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
misunderstand
my
question.
it
is
this:
why
can't
berkeley
require
that
every
person
or
entity
or
corporation
that
contributes
to
this
entity
have
to
disclose
their
identities
and
the
amounts
of
their
contributions?
unknown
speaker
but
can't
berkeley
require
a
different
method
of
disclosure
and
a
different
timing,
so
that
you
can
achieve
your
goal
in
a
less
restrictive
fashion?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
about
present
california
law?
does
it
require
no
pre-election
disclosure?
unknown
speaker
does
the
city
of
berkeley
have
any
present
pre-election
disclosure
laws?
unknown
speaker
and
what
does
the
ordinance
at
issue
here
today
add
to
that?
unknown
speaker
if
someone
wants
to
give
more
than
$250
or
spend
more
than
$250,
he
has
to
spend
it
himself.
and
then
when
he
spends
it,
at
the
time
he
spends
it
the
source
will
he
disclosed.
that's
what
you
mean,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
the
city
require
that
the
communication
put
on,
this
ad
paid
for
by
pacific
gas
&
electric?
unknown
speaker
ms.
west,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
for
that
proposition,
or
to
support
the
allegation
that
voters'
perceptions
are
being
affected?
or
are
these
just
assumptions
made
on
the
basis
of
some
social
science
articles?
unknown
speaker
is
the
city's
motivation
in
part,
then,
to,
in
effect,
muzzle
the
contributors
with
deep
pockets
to
enhance
the
relative
voting
strength
of
those
with
less
money,
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
what
authorities
do
you
look
to
to
say
that
we
shouldn't
apply
a
strict
scrutiny
here?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
lowenstein
study?
unknown
speaker
you
point
out
in
your
footnote
on
page
11
of
your
brief
that
when
the
money...
one-sided
spending
in
support
of
a
proposition,
it
comes
out
about
50/50,
that
half
the
time
it's
successful
and
half
it
isn't.
then
you
have
a
footnote
that
says
on
the
other
hand,
of
the
ten
propositions
opposed
by
significant
one-sided
spending,
none
were
defeated.
unknown
speaker
i
missed,
okay,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
shouldn't
that
be
submitted
if
it's
going
to
be
advanced
as
a
justification
to
some
sort
of
a
form
of
cross
examination?
shouldn't
it
be
offered
as
testimony
and
be
subjected
to
the
scrutiny
of
hostile
cross
examination
before
it's
just
taken
as
a
given?
particularly
if
it's
in
draft
form
and
is
expected
to
appear
six
months
from
now?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question
about...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
unknown
speaker
but
this
was
not
something
before
the
legislature
when
it
passed
the--
it's
important
to
remember
that
this
was
an
initiative
measure.
it
was
passed
by
the
people,
so
to
the
extent
that
it
reflects
the
people's
perceptions
of
what
the
political
process
is,
i
would
urge
that
the
court
give
that
the
greatest
deference,
as
is
appropriate
to
the
interpretation
of
initiative
measures.
you
want
us
to
consider
it
as
a
fact?
how
can
we?
this
is
an
unpublished
document.
how
can
we
consider
it
as
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
shouldn't
you
or
somebody
go
get
the
originals?
isn't
that
the
way
you
try
lawsuits?
could
you
have
had
this
admitted
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
had
this
admitted
when
you
tried
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well
how
can
you
have
it
admitted
here?
unknown
speaker
on
what
basis
would
you
have
it
admitted
if
it
was
an
unpublished
document?
unknown
speaker
why?
can
we
take
judicial
notice
of
it?
unknown
speaker
how?
it's
not
even
published.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you,
you
suggest
we
take
legislative
notice
of
the
outcome
of
all
these
ballot
measures,
and
this
document
is
an
example
of
some.
do
you
happen
to
know
what
percentage
of
ballot
measures
of
this
kind
are
successful?
i
imagine
it's
a
minority,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
you
consider
the
relevant
universe
of
ballot
measures.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
just
in
california
or
countrywide?
unknown
speaker
and
where
would
we
find
that
information?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
but
the
city
attorney
tells
us
that's
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
a
matter
for
this
court
to
interpret
state
ordinances,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
did
the
city
declare
a
forfeiture
here?
unknown
speaker
does
the
superior
court
interpret
the
ordinance
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
could
they
pay
the
newspapers
for
that
space?
