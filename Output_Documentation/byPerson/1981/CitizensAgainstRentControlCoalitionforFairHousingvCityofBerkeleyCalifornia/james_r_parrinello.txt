mr.
james
r.
parrinello
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
limits
on
contributions
to
ballot
measure
campaign
committees
violate
the
first
amendment
guarantees
of
speech
and
association.
berkeley
law
limits
to
$250
the
amount
that
a
citizen
may
contribute
to
support
or
oppose
a
ballot
measure.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
1977
berkeley
election
where
voters
were
asked
to
accept
or
reject
a
proposal
which
would
have
enacted
rent
control
in
the
city
of
berkeley.
groups
of
citizens
associated
together
to
oppose
the
rent
control
ballot
measure.
under
berkeley
law,
that
citizen
association
was
deemed
to
be
a
campaign
committee.
the
committee
solicited
and
received
contributions
in
excess
of
$250.00.
shortly
before
the
election,
the
city
decided
that
those
contributions
violated
the
campaign
contribution
limit,
and
it
ordered
the
committee
to
immediately
forfeit
the
excess
funds
to
the
city
treasury.
believing
that
the
forfeiture
would
impair
its
ability
to
communicate
its
message
to
the
electorate
prior
to
election
day,
the
committee
and
its
supporters
filed
suit
and
sought
and
obtained
preliminary
injunctive
relief
in
the
superior
court,
and
used
the
additional
funds
to
communicate
its
message
to
the
voters
prior
to
the
election.
thereafter,
the
committee
moved
for
and
obtained
summary
judgment
in
the
superior
court,
which
held
that
the
campaign
contribution
limit
violated
the
first
amendment.
the
california
court
of
appeals,
by
a
vote
of
three
judges
to
none,
affirmed
the
summary
judgment.
the
california
supreme
court,
by
a
vote
of
four
judges
to
three,
reversed,
splitting
on
the
constitutional
issue.
the
majority
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
failed
to
reconcile
itself
with,
or
even
to
recognize,
a
prior
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
which
struck
down
virtually
identical
ballot
measure
contribution
limits
in
the
state
of
florida.
that
unanimous
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
entitled
let's
help
florida
v.
mccrary,
is
now
pending
before
this
court.
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
this
case
involves
ballot
measure
campaigns
and
ballot
measure
campaign
committees.
it
does
not
involve
candidate
campaigns
for
public
office.
a
limitation
on
the
amount
that
citizens
may
contribute
to
a
ballot
measure
campaign
committee
simultaneously
affects
the
exercise
of
fundamental
first
amendment
rights
in
a
number
of
ways.
the
effects
can
best
be
viewed
as
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
on
the
one
hand,
ballot
measure
contribution
limits
impair
the
ability
of
citizens
to
associate
together,
to
communicate
their
message
to
the
voters
as
effectively
as
possible
on
an
issue
of
public
importance.
on
the
other
hand,
these
limits
under
attack
here
deprive
the
public
of
vitally
needed
information
and
restrict
their
access
to
the
marketplace
of
ideas
at
the
time
when
they
need
it
most,
when
they
are
being
asked
to
decide
issues
for
themselves.
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
a
ballot
measure
contribution
is
to
purchase
or
enhance
communication
of
the
message
to
the
voters.
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
a
limitation
on
ballot
measure
contributions
to
limit
or
to
restrict
that
vital
communication.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
your
honor,
i
believe
that
in
our
case,
it's
very
similar
to
first
national
bank
of
boston
v.
bellotti
because
there
the
court
held
that
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign,
there
is
no
legitimate
governmental
interest
to
support
restrictions
on
first
amendment
rights
in
the
form
of
campaign
spending.
if
anything,
the
restrictions
here
are
more
onerous
than
the
restrictions
in
bellotti
because
they
affect
the
rights
of
citizens
or
national
persons
as
well
as
the
rights
of
corporations.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor,
the
principal
reason
that
the
argument
would
be
the
same
is
that
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign,
there's
no
legitimate
compelling
governmental
interest
to
support
any
restriction
on
the
citizen's
ability
to
communicate.
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign,
a
proposal
embodied
in
such
a
measure,
in
such
a
ballot
measure,
may
target
any
number
of
citizens'
rights.
and
the
ability
of
citizens
to
communicate
their
ideas
with
respect
to
a
ballot
measure
is
important
to
the
public's
right
to
know.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
no
legitimate
governmental
interest
to
be
supported.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
i
believe
it's
both
of
those
rights,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
that's
absolutely
correct,
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
a
corporation
in
california?
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
i
believe
that's
correct.
the
purpose
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign
committee
is
to
express
the
community
of
interest
or
the
joint
political
beliefs
of
the
contributors
or
association
members.
in
today's
society,
as
this
court
has
noted,
speech
or
communication
costs
money,
and
it
is
the
pooling
of
individual
resources
in
the
form
of
campaign
contributions
to
a
ballot
measure
committee
that
enhances
the
effectiveness
of
that
communication.
ballot
measures
are
often
complex
and
post
complex
issues,
which
if
enacted
will
have
effects
that
are
unknown
to
the
average
voter,
or
are
difficult
for
the
average
voter
to
perceive.
these
effects
are
best
ascertained
by
research,
which
is
best
purchased
by
committees
which
have
the
ability
to
conduct
that
research
through
the
resources
gained
by
the
pooling
of
their
contributors'
contributions.
the
committee
then
communicates
to
the
voters
the
results
of
that
research,
together
with
data,
facts,
opinions
and
reasoning
of
its
contributors
for
a
single
purpose;
to
advocate
the
passage
or
the
rejection
of
a
ballot
measure.
these
communications
in
today's
society
cost
money;
they
take
the
form
of
mailings,
newspaper
advertisements,
television
or
other
media
advertising.
this
ballot
measure
contribution
limit,
by
restraining
that
form
of
communication,
imposes
substantial
restraints
upon
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
ballot
measures
often
deal
with
issues
and
ask
the
voter
to
decide
issues
which
affect
the
property,
private
property
rights,
which
affect
the
community
in
which
we
live.
indeed,
these
types
of
ballot
measures
often
touch
people's
lives
directly.
the
ballot
measure
process
is
a
form
of
direct
democracy.
it
is
where
the
citizens
decide
for
themselves
issues
of
public
importance.
citizens
in
this
form
of
democracy
act
as
legislators,
but
they
do
not
have
the
resources
available
to
them
that
legislators
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
approve
or
reject
certain
proposed
laws,
because
they
do
not
have
legislative
staff
and
staff
expertise.
it
is
particularly
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign
where
the
citizens
have
to
decide
important
issues
for
themselves
that
it
is
important
for
them
to
have
free
access
to
all
competing
points
of
views.
any
restriction
on
that
access
to
information
cannot
be
justified,
particularly
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign
where
first
amendment
rights
deserve
perhaps
the
greatest
protection.
ballot
measures
are
inanimate.
unlike
a
candidate,
they
have
no
voice
and
they
have
no
personality.
as
a
result,
ballot
measures
often
suffer
from
low
visibility.
in
this
context
a
ballot
measure
campaign
committee
is
the
agent
and
voice
of
its
contributors
and
members
for
a
single
purpose;
to
communicate
a
message
to
the
voters
to
vote
for
or
against
the
proposal
contained
in
the
ballot
measure.
the
city
of
berkeley
argues
that
even
though
citizens
may
be
limited
by
this
contribution
limit...
that's
$250.00...
that
those
same
citizens
may
spend
money
as
much
as
they
desire
to
communicate
their
views,
so
long
as
the
citizens
spend
that
money
independently
of
all
others.
but
it
is
not
what
first
amendment
rights
berkeley
has
allowed
the
citizens
to
continue
to
exercise;
it
is
what
they
have
taken
away.
and
the
right
that
away
is
perhaps
the
only
effective
mean
most
have
to
participate
in
the
ballot
measure
campaign
process.
that
is
the
right
to
contribute.
a
simple
example
will
illustrate
this
point.
the
largest
single
contributor
to
the
committee
here
contributed
$5000.
that
$5000,
if
spent
independently,
would
have
been
able
to
purchase
less
than
a
third,
approximately
a
third,
of
a
single
mailing
to
all
the
voters
in
the
city
of
berkeley
at
the
time
of
this
1977
election.
because
as
the
record
indicates,
a
single
mailing
to
all
berkeley
registered
voters
at
the
time
of
this
election
cost
almost
$13,000.
so
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
exercise
of
this
right
to
independently
campaign
or
to
have
unlimited
expenditures
is
a
right
that
only
the
very
wealthy
citizens
can
enjoy.
and
indeed,
there
are
very
few
other
citizens
who
even
though
they
possess
that
right
can
exercise
it.
i
would
like
to,
by
way
of
example,
show
two
other
effects
of
this
ballot
measure
contribution
limit.
such
a
limit
would
prohibit
two
berkeley
citizens
who
share
a
common
view
for
or
against
a
ballot
measure
from
spending
$300
each
to
purchase
a
newspaper
ad,
where
each
of
those
two
citizens
advocates
the
passage
or
defeat
of
a
ballot
measure.
the
limit
would
prohibit
20
citizens
from
spending
$600
each
to
purchase
the
postage
and
writing
materials
and
printing
materials
necessary
for
those
20
citizens
to
send
the
informational
pamphlet
to
berkeley
voters,
communicating
their
joint
interest
in
opposing
or
supporting
a
ballot
measure.
the
net
effect
and
purpose,
the
net
effect
of
a
contribution
limit
such
as
this
will
ultimately
frustrate
people
from
participating
in
the
political
process
because
it
takes
away
from
them
the
only
effective
means
that
they
have
to
participate,
particularly
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
that's
correct,
your
honor,
our
arguments
are
applicable
to
candidate
campaigns.
the
distinction
between
the
ballot
measure
campaign
and
the
candidate
campaign
is
that
there
is
no
governmental
interest
of
vital
importance
that
is
served
by
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit;
no
logical
connection
between
a
ballot
measure
contribution
and
its
target...
the
restriction
of
the
flow
of
communication
to
the
voters...
and
any
compelling
governmental
interest.
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
buckley,
there
is
such
a
nexus
or
a
compelling
governmental
interest
with
respect
to
candidate
contribution
limits.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
justice
white,
the
california
supreme
court's
findings
of
compelling
interests
were,
in
sum,
i
believe
two,
which
is
that
the
government,
the
contribution
limit
sustains
the
integrity
or
promotes
the
integrity
of
the
ballot
measure
process
and
promotes
an
alert
citizenry.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
correct.
the
other
side
of
that
coin.
with
respect
to
the
appearance
of
money
dominating
the
campaign,
all
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
appellees
are
saying
is
that...
to
recognize
what
this
court
has
recognized,
which
is
that
money
purchases
communication
or
enhances
communication
in
the
context
of
an
election
campaign.
and
that
communication
may
be
persuasive
upon
the
voters.
indeed,
that's
its
purpose.
but
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
the
fact
that
speech
or
communication
may
be
persuasive
is
not
a
reason
to
suppress
it.
and
that
is
something
that
the
california--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
i
believe
that's
what
the
cases
say.
that's
our
reading
of
the
cases.
but
more
importantly,
there
is
no
logical
connection
between
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit
here
whose
only
target
is
to
restrict
speech,
and
any
governmental
interest
including
the
promotion
of
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process.
because
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
decision
in
bellotti,
particularly
the
context
of
the
citizens
making
their
own
decision
in
a
referendum
or
a
ballot
measure
campaign,
that
is
where
the
citizens
need
the
access,
the
greatest
possible
access,
to
conflicting
points
of
view.
and
rather
than
promoting
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
what
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit
does
by
restricting
speech
is
to
denigrate
or
diminish
the
integrity
of
that
process
ultimately.
the
same
can
be
said
with
respect
to
the
supreme
court's
determination,
the
california
supreme
court's
determination,
of
a
compelling
interest
in
maintaining
an
alert
citizenry.
it's
illogical
to
say
that
by
restricting
information
and
communication
on
a
vital
issue
of
public
importance
that
that
promotes
an
alert
citizenry.
how
can
the
deprivation
of
information
to
the
citizens
promote
and
inform
the
alert
citizenry?
we
believe
that
there
is
no
logical
connection
between
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit,
whose
only
effect
is
to
reduce
speech,
and
any
governmental
interest.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
bellotti,
the
issue
posed
in
bellotti
was
whether
or
not
contributions
or
expenditures
could
be
prohibited
completely.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
i
believe
the
issue
was
contributions
or
expenditures.
but
whether
i'm
right
or
wrong
in
my
recollection--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--no,
it
doesn't
prevent
expenditures,
but
what
it
does
is
to
limit
the
ability
of
citizens
to
associate
together
by
the
pooling
of
their
resources.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
our
view
is
that
the
principles
in
bellotti,
while
perhaps
not
on
all
fours,
do
cover
this
case
in
that
in
bellotti,
the
court
dealt
with
a
restriction
on
spending
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign,
and
this
case
involves
a
ballot
measure
campaign
as
well.
i
agree
that
it's
not
all
fours
with
bellotti,
but
we
believe
the
principles
of
bellotti.
it
is
important
to
distinguish
this
case
between...
to
distinguish
ballot
measure
contributions
and
contributions
to
candidate
campaigns.
a
limitation
on
a
contribution
to
a
candidate
prevents
corruption,
prevents
the
contributor
from
gaining
or
appearing
to
gain
undue
influence
over
the
candidate.
in
effect,
money
buys
allegiance,
and
large
contributions
have
the
threat
to
purchase
the
allegiance
or
to
purchase
undue
influence
over
a
particular
candidate,
and
to
cause
that
candidate,
once
he
or
she
assumes
public
office,
to
elevate
the
interests
of
the
large
contributor
above
the
interests
of
the
candidate's
constituency,
and
thereby
subvert
the
will
of
the
people.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
your
honor,
under
california
law,
the
committee
is
in
a
fiduciary
or
trustee
position
with
its
contributors
so
that
it
can
only
spend
the
money
for
the
purpose
of
advocating
the
passage
or
defeat
of
the
ballot
measure.
it
could
not
spend
the
money
for
the
purpose
of
giving
it
to
a
candidate,
for
example.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
it
depends
upon
how
the
particular
committee
is
formed,
but--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--this
particular
committee
had
approximately
125
people
on
a
steering
committee,
which
basically
decided
the
manner
in
which
the
campaign
was
going
to
be
run.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
that's
correct,
except
that
under
the
law
in
california
the
committee
had
to
spend
the
money
for
the
purpose
of
advocating
the
defeat
of
this
proposed
ballot
measure
in
berkeley.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
well,
in
this
particular
case
it
was--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--that's
correct.
so
with
the
proviso
that
the
committee
had
to
spend
the
money
for
the
purposes
of
advocating
the
defeat
of
the
measure.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
they
would
apply
if
the
state
of
california
enacted
them.
at
the
present
time,
there
are
no
such
limits
on
the
state
level
but
there
are
bills
pending
in
the
legislature.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
city
of
berkeley
also
advocates
that
the
governmental
interest
in
disclosure
is
served
by
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit.
but
at
the
present
time
and
in
1977,
the
city
of
berkeley
had
in
effect
perhaps
the
most
stringent
disclosure
laws
in
the
nation.
if
the
city
of
berkeley
decides
or
deems
that
if
existing
disclosure
laws
are
not
sufficient
to
meet
its
purposes
it
can
draft
narrowly-restrictive
disclosure
laws
which
directly
serve
the
purpose
of
disclosure,
but
the
government
interest
in
promoting
disclosure
cannot
be
served
by
suppressing
speech,
which
is
what
this
ballot
measure
contribution
limit
ultimately
does.
the
only
purpose
of
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit
is
to
equalize
the
relative
voices
of
different
segments
of
our
society.
but
the
concept
that
government
may
restrict
the
voices
of
some
to
equalize
the
voice
of
others
is
formed
in
the
first
amendment.
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
contrary
to
precedents
of
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
second,
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
circuits
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
of
appellate
courts
in
texas
and
california.
these
courts,
in
scrutinizing
ballot
measure
spending
and
contribution
restrictions,
stated
that
in
the
context
of
a
ballot
measure
campaign
where
the
only
purpose
of
a
contribution
was
to
enhance
communication,
that
there
is
no
compelling
governmental
interest,
no
justifiable
interest,
to
warrant
the
suppression
of
vital
first
amendment
rights.
the
decision
below
is
erroneous
and
it
should
be
reversed.
the
sole
purpose
and
effect
of
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit
is
to
restrict
political
communication
because
it
may
he
too
persuasive.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
i
do
not
believe
so,
because
i
believe
that
a
newspaper's
editorial,
as
long
as
it
was
not
made
in
concert
with
any
other
newspaper
or
any
other
campaign
committee
or
individual,
would
be
considered
an
expenditure--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
it's
one
i
hadn't
thought
of.
but
it
could
well
under
those
circumstances.
because
the
ballot
measure
contribution
limit
is
targeted
at
communication,
because
its
purpose
is
to
limit
communication,
because
it
perceives
that
too
much
communication
is
evil,
we
believe
there
is
no
compelling
governmental
interest;
indeed,
no
legitimate
governmental
purpose,
to
support
a
ballot
measure
contribution
limit.
and
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
the
context
of
the
exercise
of
these
core
first
amendment
rights,
and
governmental
infringements
on
those
rights,
we
believe
that
government
has
the
burden
to
demonstrate
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
overriding
those
rights.
and
by
compelling--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--i
understand.
i'll
try
to
give
you
my
definition
of
it,
which
i
believe
is
that
in
the
context
of
the
exercise
of
these
rights.
it
is
a
vital
governmental
interest
of
overriding
importance
which
directly
serves...
not
randomly
serves
but
directly
serves
to
promote
an
imminently
threatened
governmental
interest.
and
we
believe
that
this
ballot
measure
contribution--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--we
don't
believe
it's
a
balancing
test.
we
believe
that
it's
more
than
that.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
we
don't
believe
it
is
a
balancing
test.
we
believe
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
demonstrate
not
merely
that
they
have
an
interest
and
that
it's
an
important
interest,
but
also
that
this
law
directly
serves
that
interest.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
certainly
the
court
has
used
the
term
in
many,
many
first
amendment
cases
and--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--i
believe
it
does,
with
the
addition
that
the
law
is
required
to
be
narrowly
drafted
in
order
to
not
burden
unnecessarily
first
amendment
rights.
and
we
also
believe
this
law
is
not
narrowly
drafted.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
berkeley
definition
of
a
contribution
does
not
turn
upon
who
controls
the
contribution.
section
205
of
the
berkeley
ordinance,
which
appears
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix
at
a-60
defines
committee...
and
i
will
paraphrase,
but
it
defines
committee
as
any
person
or
combination
of
persons
that
directly
or
indirectly
makes
expenditures
exceeding
more
than
$250
in
a
calendar
year
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
or
attempting
to
influence
the
action
of
voters
for
or
against
the
passage
of
a
ballot
measure.
the
berkeley
ordinance
in
section
206,
again
on
page
60
of
jurisdictional
statement
appendix,
defines
contributions
to
that
committee
as
a
gift,
subscription,
loan,
advance
or
anything
of
value
made
directly
or
indirectly
in
aid
of
or
in
opposition
to
a
ballot
measure.
the
very
example
which
i
stated
to
the
court
about
the
two
people
wishing
to
buy
a
newspaper
ad
and
spend
$600
to
do
so
is
directly
covered
by
this
ordinance,
because
those
two
people
are
a
combination
of
persons
who
equal
a
committee
which,
by
purchasing
that
newspaper
ad,
are
making
an
indirect
expenditure.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
i
appreciate
that,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
ordinance
that
states...
and
the
law
is
a
matter
for
the
court
to
decide...
there
is
nothing
in
the
ordinance
that
states--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--it's
not
for
the
court
to
interpret
state
ordinances,
i
agree,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
the
meaning
of
this
particular
law.
but
the
court
does
have
the
right
and
the
power
to
interpret
laws
and
determine
whether
they
meet
constitutional
requirements,
and
this
particular
law
does
not.
because
it
does
impose
a
direct
restraint
on
those
very
citizens
to
associate
together
in
any
form
to
communicate
their
joint
ideas.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
the
city
did
declare
a
forfeiture,
but
the
superior
court
enjoined
the
forfeiture,
and
the
funds
were
used
in
the
campaign.
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
state
the
manner
in
which
the
ordinance
was
interpreted
by
the
court.
it
simply
took
notice
of
the
limitation
and
struck
it
down
as
being
unconstitutional.
the
city
interest
in
disclosure
can
be
met
in
several
ways
which
the
city
of
berkeley
has
not
recognized.
at
the
present
time,
city
of
berkeley
law
requires
the
disclosure
in
pre-election
report
filings
two
times
before
each
election
of
all
contributions
larger
than
$250.00,
and
city
law
requires
that
local
newspapers
publish
those
contributions
in
the
names
of
the
contributors
twice
before
each
election.
so
to
say
that
the
public--
mr.
james
r.
parrinello
--yes,
they
could,
or
they
could
require
the
committee,
in
effect,
to
pay
for
more
frequent
disclosure
in
local
newspapers.
but
more
importantly,
the
city
doesn't
say
that
it
has
done
anything
about
the
apparent
or
perceived
evil
it
sees
in
the
names
of
campaign
committees,
because
it
says
those
names
are
misleading.
rather
than
suppress
speech,
the
city
of
berkeley
can
regulate
the
names
of
the
campaign
committees
if
it
desires.
the
federal
government
has
done
that
with
respect
to
candidate
campaigns.
thank
you.
