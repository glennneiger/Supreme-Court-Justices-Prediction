mr.
natalie
e.
west
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
not
bellotti.
as
justice
white
recognized,
in
bellotti,
the
court's
analysis
was
directed
at
the
prohibition
of
expenditures.
this
is
a
contribution
limitation.
expenditures
are
not
restricted
in
any
way.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
no,
your
honor,
every--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--you're
speaking
then
of
the
campaign
committee
which--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--you're
speaking
of
the
campaign
committee
which,
under
a
contribution
limitation,
must
raise
more
funds
from
a
greater
number
of
people.
that
does
not
limit
the
speech
which
the
campaign
committee
can
engage
in.
in
fact,
it
furthers
an
important
democratic
interest
because
it
broadens
the
base
of
the
campaign
committee
by
requiring
them
to
seek
contributions
from
more--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--no,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
what
the
berkeley
ordinance
does
in
this
case
is
exactly
what
the
court
was
espousing
in
buckley.
the
contribution
limitation
applies
evenhandedly
to
all.
others
who
want
to
participate,
participate
through
the
means
of
direct
expenditures.
i'd
like
to
pick
up
for
a
moment
on
some
of
the
points
made
by
appellant
in
his
opening
remarks.
in
appellants'
reply
brief
and
in
their
statements
today,
they
demonstrate
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
difference
between
expenditures
and
contributions.
the
distinction
between
a
campaign
contribution
and
a
campaign
expenditure
turns
on
who
controls
the
speech.
if
i
take
$200
and
get
together
with
a
friend
who's
got
$200
and
we
buy
an
ad
in
the
newspaper,
that
is
an
expenditure.
that
is
not
limited
or
restricted
in
any
way
by
the
berkeley
ordinance.
the
berkeley
ordinance
restricts
contributions,
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
buckley
and
in
your
recent
decision
of
california
medical
association,
quote,
"contribution
limitations
impose
a
far
less
of
an
impact
on
protected
rights.
"
mr.
natalie
e.
west
that's
correct,
that
together
we
would
develop
a
joint
communication,
a
joint
message,
and
that
is,
again,
enhancing
a
very
basic
principle
of
democracy;
to
try
to
increase
and
expand
participation
by
individuals
in
the
process.
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
berkeley
ordinance
seeks
to
do.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
i
think
that
that
still
would
remain
a
contribution,
justice
stevens,
if
the--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--a
joint
expenditure
is
if
you
have
some
control
in
the
content
and
the
time,
place
and
manner
of
the
communication.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
then
you
go
over
the
limit,
the
line,
and
it
probably
becomes
an
expenditure.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
under
federal
law,
this
exact
same
kind
of
line-drawing
has
taken
place
as
the
fec
has
adopted
regulations
to
distinguish
independent
expenditures
which
are
exempt
from
the
$1000
campaign
contribution
limitation
from
the
contributions.
and--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--if
you--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--if
you
put
in
$5000
and
you
have
some
control
over
the
content
of
the
message,
over
the
time,
place
and
manner
of
the
communication
so
that
the
communication
acknowledges
your
involvement
in
it,
then
you...
it
becomes
an
expenditure;
it's
no
longer
a
contribution.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
the
definition
of
contribution
turns
on
control,
and
it's
the
same
kind
of
distinction
that
this
court
made
in
the
california
medical
association
case.
the
protected
element
of
an
expenditure
is
a
disbursement
that's
made
independently
in
order
to
engage
directly
in
political
speech.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
the
two
definitions
are
actually
very
comparable.
i'm
talking
about
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
followed
in
order
to
distinguish--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--i
want
to
stress
again,
it's
more
than
just
approval
over
the
message.
it's
some
kind
of
involvement
in
the
time,
place
and
manner.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
if...
yes,
it
is.
if
the
individual
is
engaging
in
political
speech
by
spending
money
and
helping
to
determine
what
the
message
is
and
determining
where
it's
going
to
be
dispersed,
how
it's
going
to
be
communicated
to
the
electorate,
then
it
becomes
an
expenditure
and
it
is
not
subject
to
the
ordinance.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
i'm
telling
you
what
the
situation
is
under
our
local
ordinance.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
would
lead
to
a
different
result.
there's
nothing
in
the--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--justice
stevens,
i
would
submit
that
i'm
right
in
order
to
be--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
construe
it
any
other
way.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
no,
the
situation
has
never
arisen.
returning
again
to
the
situation
that
faces
us
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
contribution
limitation
which
applies
in
an
evenhanded
way
to
all
participants
in
a
political
campaign.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
that's
a
very
significant
question
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
because
a
balancing
test
is
the
appropriate
test.
the
governmental
regulation
affects
the
communicative
impact
of
the
speech
to
some
extent;
a
minor
extent
but
nevertheless
to
some
extent.
but
the
interests
being
advanced
by
the
city
of
berkeley
are
themselves
first
amendment
interests
of
the
highest
importance.
we
are
concerned
with
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
with
improving
the
accuracy
of
speech,
the
diversity
of
political
speech.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
i
would
submit
that
it
wouldn't,
justice
rehnquist.
but
to
follow
with
justice
o'connor's
question,
then
the
appropriate
test
is
to
balance
the
impact
on
protected
rights,
which
is
very
minor,
against
the
importance
of
the
governmental
interests
being
advanced,
which
are
very
significant.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
we
have
two
daily
newspapers.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
but,
justice
marshall,
the
effect
of
the
contribution
limitation
is
to
require
the
campaign
committee
to
receive
funds
from
diverse
sources.
in
this
case,
citizens
against
rent
control
received
contributions
from
over
1300
contributors.
a
handful
of
those
made
contributions
in
excess
of
$250.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
contributors
contribute
less
than
$250.
those
individuals
can
participate
through
means
of
campaign
contributions
to
the
campaign
committee.
other
persons
must
make
direct
expenditures.
they
can
do
so
jointly
with
other
people
so
long
as
they
take
a
role
in--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--justice
marshall,
the--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--the
facts
of
this
case
show,
however,
that
the
campaign
committee
raised
almost
$100,000
in
contributions
of
less
than
$250.
that
is
the
local
scene
in
berkeley,
california.
now
there's
another
very
important
state
interest
that's
advanced
by
this
regulation,
and
that
is
the
state's
interest
in
disclosure.
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
can
spend
all
the
money
it
wants
to
in
a
berkeley
ballot
measure
campaign,
but
it
cannot
do
so
under
the
name
of
southwest
berkeley
no,
no,
no
on
w.
by
requiring
entities
to
spend
money,
who
wish
to
spend
money
in
excess
of
$250.00
to
spend
money
directly,
the
city
requires
the
disclosure,
and
thus
better
informs
the
voters,
of
who
is
participating
in
election
campaigns.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
that
type
of
disclosure
does
not
serve
the
interests
that
are
particularly
important
in
a
ballot
measure
campaign,
where
unlike
a
candidate
campaign,
there's
no
person
that
gives
identity.
and
what
the
situation
that
you
have,
is
that
campaign
committees
adopt
names
like
let's
help
florida,
which
is
a
group
that
seeks
to
legalize
casino
gambling--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--well,
they
do
under
current
disclosure
law,
but
that
information
is
disclosed
on
campaign
disclosure
statements
that
are
filed
by
the
committee
before
the
election.
what
we
submit
here
is
that--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--we've
tried
to
design
some
approaches
that
would
achieve
that
goal,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
appropriately
do
so.
let
me
just
discuss
some
possible
examples.
we
thought
one
approach
would
be
to
require
the
disclosure
of
the
big
contributors
as
part
of
the
communication.
but
then
you
get
to
a
point
where
the
disclosure,
in
fact,
overwhelms
the
communication.
for
example,
in
this
case,
imagine
a
30-second
radio
spot
that
ends
up
by
saying
it's
financed
by
citizens
against
bent
control/coalition
for
fair
housing,
california
association
of
realtors,
mason-mcduffie
company,
berkeley
board
of
realtors,
apartment
political
act
and
committee,
mayor
monte
company,
b.g.
management
company,
southern
alameda
county
board
of
realtors.
the
disclosure
is
part
of
the
content
in
a
campaign
context,
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
bellotti.
striking
down
the
prohibition
against
corporate
expenditures,
the
court
pointed
out
that
corporate
advertising
is
likely
to
be
highly
visible,
that
the
corporate
identity
will
help
the
voters
evaluate
the
source
of
the
message
to
make
a
well-informed
decision.
that's
the
goal
that
we're
trying
to
achieve
in
this
case.
now
another
disclosure
possibility
would
be
to
enact
an
ordinance
that
would
require
the
campaign
committee
to
state
the
title
of
the
message
and
its
position
on
the
measure,
and
that
would
avoid
the
problem
with
the
act
of
misrepresentation.
but
nevertheless,
it
doesn't
further
the
disclosure
because
all
you
get
is
something
along
the
lines
of
committee
for
smoking
and
non-smoking
sections,
no
on
5,
but
you
don't
know
who
it
is.
so
i
would
submit
that
in
fact
the
city
has
considered
disclosure
alternatives,
and
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
identify
an
alternative
that
serves
the...
furthers
the
purpose
in
a
content-neutral
way
in
the
way
that
this
type
of
a
limitation
does.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
there
are...
no,
california
law
requires
two
campaign
disclosure
statements
to
be
filed
before
the
election
by
the
committee.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
it's
the
same.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
the
ordinance
required
by
imposing
a
$250
limitation,
the
ordinance
serves
a
disclosure
purpose
by
requiring
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
of
the
source
of
the
communication.
i'd
like
to
pick
up
on
this
southwest
berkeley
no,
no--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--yes.
i'm
sorry,
justice
white.
thank
you.
and
then
to
move
on,
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
is
to
demonstrate
how
significant
a
part
disclosure,
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
can
play
in
the
evaluation
of
the
message,
you
remember
from
my
brief
in
1974
ballot
measure,
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
funneled
over
$7000
into
a
committee
called
southwest
berkeley
no,
no,
no
on
w.
southwest
berkeley
is
in
the
flatlands
adjacent
to
emoryville
and
oakland.
it's
the
poorest
section
of
town
with
a
high
minority
population.
the
connotation
of
a
communication
that's
labeled
southwest
berkeley
no,
no,
no
on
w
is
entirely
different
from
the
connotation
of
pacific
gas
&
electric.
i
would
submit...
and
we
certainly
acknowledge...
that
pacific
gas
&
electric
can
participate
to
the
fullest
extent
in
berkeley
campaigns,
but
that
it
helps
the
voter
evaluate
the
communication
when
the
source
of
that
communication
is
made
immediately
available.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
as
i
stated
to
justice
o'connor,
there's
a
real
problem
there.
in
that
particular
instance
we
could
have
done
that
because
there's
only
one.
that
was
only
one
entity;
it
was,
in
fact,
a
front
for
one
entity.
but
if
there
are
a
number
of
entities
funneling
substantial
amounts
of
money
into
the
campaign
committee
then
the
disclosure
can
actually
overwhelm
the
message,
as
it
would
in
this
case.
if
you
were
required
to
rattle
down
the
names
of
the
over
250
contributors
each
time
you
made
a
30-second
radio
spot,
for
example.
i
don't
want
to
overlook
the
very
important
governmental
interest
in
increasing
and
expanding
voter
participation
in
election
campaigns.
the
contribution
limitation
seeks
to
achieve
that
goal
in
a
number
of
ways.
first,
campaign
committees
that
are
going
to
raise
money
and
participate
in
local
campaigns
must
raise
funds
from
a
greater
number
of
persons.
this
has
a
very
direct
impact
in
broadening
the
base
of
support
and
participation
in
ballot
measure
campaigns.
second,
individuals
who
care
to
participate
in
a
campaign
by
spending
more
than
$250
must
do
so
by
making
direct
expenditures,
not
contributions.
this
increases
the
range
and
diversity
of
ideas
that
are
expressed
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas;
that
in
fact
furthers
the
governmental
interest
to
promote
involvement
with
citizens
in
helping
them
understand
the
issues
that
they're
being
called
upon
to
debate.
we're
not
seeking
to
stifle
debate
in
this
case.
we're
not
seeking
to
cut
off
voices.
what
the
city
of
berkeley
is
trying
to
do
is
to
make
the
initiative
as
representative
of
a
broad
base
of
people
as
possible,
to
provide
information
to
the
voters
so
that
they
can
understand
the
diverse
issues
that
are
present
in
a
ballot
measure
campaign.
i
would
submit
that
this
is
enough
of
an
interest
and
enough
of
a
showing
to
support
what
the
city
is
trying
to
do
here
with
its
contribution
limitation.
the
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
california
medical
association
is
particularly
instructive
because
the
court
made
it
clear
that...
the
plurality
opinion...
that
contributions
are
far
less
of
an
infringement
on
protected
rights
than
expenditures.
now
using
the
appropriate
balancing
test,
the
governmental
restriction
here
can
be
supported
by
the
interests
that
i
have
stated.
in
bellotti,
this
court
referred
to
the
showing
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
indicated
that
massachusetts
had
made
no
showing
that
the
voice
of
corporations
was
overwhelming
or
even
significant
in
ballot
measure
campaigns.
that
particular
sentence
has
been
picked
up
and
repeated
by
most
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
validity
of
contribution
prohibitions
and
limitations
in
the
ballot
measure
context.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
is
an
over-broad
reading
of
that
sentence
in
bellotti.
again,
bellotti
was
looking
at
expenditure
limitations,
and
that
sentence
implies
that
if
you
had
evidence
that
the
referenda
process
was
being
overwhelmed
or
significantly
impacted
by
corporate
expenditure,
that
you
might
even
be
able
to
support
an
expenditure
limitation.
here
we're
dealing
only
with
a
contribution
limitation.
but
if
the
court
wants
to
impose
that
strong
a
standard
and
require
a
showing
that
large
contributions
are
overwhelming
the
political
process
and
are
causing
some
improper
functioning
of
the
initiative
process,
there
are
data
beginning
to
evolve
which
shows
that
that
may,
in
fact,
be
true,
that
very
large
campaign
contributions
channeled
into
the
political
process
do
not
educate
the
voters,
do
not
inform
the
voters.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
at
the
time
of
the
trial
court
decision
in
this
case
there
had
not
been
the
appropriate
documentation
because
most
of
this
depends
on
campaign
disclosure
laws
that
became
vigorously
enforced
in
the
mid-seventies,
so
that
we've
actually
seen
an
emerging
of
some
documentation
in
the
form
of
the
social
science
studies,
just
very
recently.
one
of
the
first
very
complete
studies
is
one
which
is
still
in
draft
and
will
be
published
in
the
spring
in
the
ucla
law
review,
which
i
have
furnished
to
the
appellants
and
to
the
court
in
draft
form.
that's
a
comprehensive
study
by
professor
daniel
lowenstein
of
california
ballot
measures
for
1968
through
1980,
in
which
he
concludes
that
there
are
a
number
of
instances
in
which
the
outcome
of
ballot
measure
campaigns
has
been
determined
by
very
large
amounts
of
money
funneled
into
a
single
campaign
committee
that
conveyed
only
a
very
narrow
message
to
the
electorate.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
no,
that's
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
at
the
time
this
ordinance
was
passed
and
similarly,
at
the
time
that
the
state
act
was
passed,
which
was
in
the
summer
of
1974,
that
was
before
this
court's
decision
in
buckley.
and
at
that
time,
i
believe
there
was
a
thinking
that
that
sort
of
equalization
theory
underlies
some
of
the
parts
of
the
statute.
but
in
the
aftermath
of
buckley,
we
recognized
that
equalization
is
not
an
appropriate
goal,
and
that's
where
the
expenditure
limitations
were
invalidated,
both
the
local
and
the
state
expenditure
limitations.
we're
now
left
with
a
situation
which
is
very
comparable
to
the
federal
situation;
a
limitation
on
contributions
and
no
limitation
on
expenditures.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
situation,
there
are
other
state
interests,
completely
unrelated
to
anything
to
do
with
equalizing
or
muzzling,
which
more
than
support
the
very
important
impact
that
this
contribution
limitation
has
on
the
political
process.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
the
court
had
used
a
balancing
standard
in
buckley
and
in
bellotti,
and
those
are
the
two
cases
that
i
think
should
govern
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
standard,
of
course,
and
the
california
medical
association
opinion
as
well.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
yes.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens,
it
should
read
nine.
i
communicated
that
typographical
error
to
the
clerk's
office,
but
the
briefs
had
already
been--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--so
please
make
that
change
right
away.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
natalie
e.
west
justice
rehnquist,
i
made
it
available
to
the
court
in
draft
form
merely
because
i
think
it
is
very
instructive
and
i
certainly
wish
that
it
were
in
final
form
at
this
time.
also,
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
does
not...
i
would
submit
that
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
does
not
have
to
rest
on
any
of
the
information
contained
therein,
that
the
information
that
you
have
available
concerning
the...
to
support
the
state
interest
in
promoting
more
accurate
campaign
literature,
more
accurate
campaign
speech
through
requiring
disclosure
and
more
diverse
campaign
speech,
through
encouraging
voter
participation
in
the
process
is
sufficient,
without
any
reference
at
all
to
what
the
characteristics
of
large
contributions
have
been
in
the
ballot
measure
context.
however,
that
information
is
before
you
and
it
is
available.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
i
was
just
going
to
point
out
that,
of
course,
the
court
can
refer
to
things
like
that
because
what
you're
being
asked
to
do
really
are
notice
legislative
facts
and
not
make
a
finding
of
a
judicial
fact.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
justice
marshall,
i
would
submit
you
don't
have
to
consider
that
at
all.
the
information,
the
data
contained
in
there,
is
all
based
on
reports
that
are
published
by
the
state
fair
political
practices
commission,--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--in
1977
this
was
not
available.
that's
part
of
the
problem,
that
we're
right
on--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--no,
your
honor,
because
this--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--i
meant
we
couldn't
have
because
it
wasn't
available
at
that
time.
we
were
talking...
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
i
think
that
document
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
this
court
to
consider--
mr.
natalie
e.
west
--yes.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
justice
marshall,
i
appreciate
your
comments
on
that.
i
think
we
have
a
difference
of
opinion
and
i'm
going
to
turn
to
justice
stevens
now.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
well,
this
kind,
you
mean
initiative
measures
or
all?
mr.
natalie
e.
west
interestingly
enough,
in
the
lowenstein
study,
he
indicates
that
over
the
last
12
years,
approximately
half
of
all
the
measures
before
the
voters
on
a
statewide
level
have
been
passed.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
yes.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
yes,
yes,
just
in
california.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
it's
in
the
lowenstein
article.
i
am
not
prepared
to
cite
the
exact
page.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
no.
mr.
natalie
e.
west
on
the
basis
of
the
information
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
the
arguments
that
we've
made
today,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
berkeley
ordinance
imposes
a
relatively
minor
infringement
on
protected
rights;
in
fact,
almost
no
infringement
on
protected
rights.
individuals'
ability
to
make
contributions
may
be
somewhat
limited,
their
ability
to
make
campaign
expenditures
is
not
restricted
in
any
way.
that
minor
restriction
is
more
than
offset
by
governmental
interests
of
the
very
highest
importance,
and
i
would
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
thank
you.
