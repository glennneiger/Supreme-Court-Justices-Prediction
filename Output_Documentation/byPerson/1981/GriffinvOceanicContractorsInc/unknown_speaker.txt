unknown
speaker
i
got
lost
a
little
bit
in
the
arithmetic
here,
counsel.
what
was
the...
in
dollars,
what
were
the
actual
dollars
he
lost
for
the
actual
days,
apart
from
all
the
penalty
provisions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chaffin,
i
gather
he
got
a
judgment
of
$23,670.
unknown
speaker
and
of
that,
only
$6,881.60
is
penalty
wages?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
the
only
item
in
issue
before
us?
unknown
speaker
maintenance
and
cure,
prejudgment
interest,
attorneys
fees
and
recovery
for
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
the
$5,000
recovery
for
pain
and
suffering
and
penalty
wages?
unknown
speaker
except
for
the
68--
unknown
speaker
--oh.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
the
only
item
we
have
is
the
penalty
wages
of
$6881?
unknown
speaker
right.
and
you
suggest
that
there's
an
argument
that
it
ought
to
be
less.
how
much
less?
unknown
speaker
none?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
does
your
adversary
say
it
ought
to
be
less
than
$6881,
nothing?
unknown
speaker
the
23,000--
unknown
speaker
--odd
dollars?
you
say
it
should
be
more,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
figure,
you
suggest?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chaffin,
under
your
theory
would
it
continue
to
run
until
this
very
day
because
it
isn't
paid?
what
about
during
the
course
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
do
you
interpret
that
holding
as
saying
that
the
court
has
discretion,
then,
not
to
give
it
during
the
appellate
period?
is
that
your
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
was
that
on
the
theory
that
the
court
had
discretion?
unknown
speaker
but
the
literal
language
would
not
appear
to
admit
for
that
distinction
either.
so
i'm
wondering
whether
the
court
may
have
discretion
that
goes
back
further.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
there--
unknown
speaker
--to
justify
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chaffin
i
suppose
it's
totally
irrelevant,
but
i
take
it
he
has
long
since
recovered
from
his
discomfiture?
unknown
speaker
were
they
unable
to
obtain
surgical
advice
for
his
hemorrhoidal
condition
in
brussels?
unknown
speaker
i
had
the
impression
from
either
your
brief
or
somewhere
that
he
had
a
complete
recovery.
unknown
speaker
very,
very
quickly.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
press
his
claim
with
the
employer
for
this
penalty
wage?
unknown
speaker
in
what
way?
unknown
speaker
it
was
16
months
before
you
instituted
suit?
unknown
speaker
not
that
it
matters,
but
in
houston
this
case
was
tried,
right?
unknown
speaker
in
sherman.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
about
30
miles
from
houston...
from
dallas,
correct?
unknown
speaker
if
this
man
had
been
injured
in
sherman,
how
much
would
he
have
collected?
if
he
had
gotten
this
same
injury
on
land
in
sherman,
as
a
lawyer
how
much
would
you
assume
be
would
collect?
unknown
speaker
i
said
if
he
was
working
for
a
truck
company
that
had
no
connection
with
the
sea
at
all
and
he
had
gotten
the
same
injury
and
suffered
the
same
injury,
same
amount
of
time,
and
he
had
sued
for
damages,
about
how
much
would
he
have
collected?
unknown
speaker
sir?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
about
what,
$100?
unknown
speaker
and
solely
because
this
happened
on
the
sea,
you
get
$300,000?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
before
you
proceed,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
how
you
get
up
to
$300,000.
if
the
$412
had
been
paid
on
may
5th,
would
that
have
ended
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
then
you
multiply
202
by
the
number
by
the
number
of
days--
unknown
speaker
--from
april
1
until
the
district
court
decided
the
case?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he...
what
was
actually
withheld,
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what
wages
were
actually
withheld?
unknown
speaker
each
week?
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
cover
the
possibility
of
his
having
to
be
sent
home?
unknown
speaker
so
this
was...
they
failed
to
pay
over
to
him
the
withholding?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
seaman.
unknown
speaker
nor
with
this
case.
do
you
think
that
withholding
is
wages
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
demanded?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
was
refused?
unknown
speaker
now,
suppose
they
had
paid
you
$411.50.
would
you
be
making
the
same
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
they
just
said...
there's
no
explanation.
what
if
they
said,
we'll
pay
you
$400.
i
guess
literally
the
statute
applies.
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
to
pay...
did
your
client
have
to
pay
his
own
way
home?
unknown
speaker
that
callous
and
recalcitrant
goes
to
the
employer's
state
of
mind,
not
to
the
amount
withheld,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
supposing
in
justice
white's
example
that
they
had
said,
we'll
pay
you
$400
and
no
more,
you
may
think
you've
got
a
claim
for
$12
but
we're
just
not
going
to
fool
around
with
it,
we
don't
care
what
the
rights
of
the
matter
are.
now,
wouldn't
you
still
have
a
claim
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
what
court
should
the
defendant
have
tendered
the
money
into?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
have
been
a
couple
of
years
after.
they
still
would
have
had
a
couple
of
years
of
penalty
wages
accrued,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
what
would
they
have
had
to
tender?
would
they
have
had
to
tender
just
the
$412
or
plus
all
the
penalty
wages
that
had
accrued
up
to
that
date?
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
could
have
done
that
at
any
time?
unknown
speaker
before
or
after
suit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chaffin,
i
think
you
told
me
earlier
that
without
the
help
of
counsel
initially
the
petitioner
made
demands
upon
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
how
frequently
were
those
demands
made?
unknown
speaker
and
on
each
instance
what
he
was
asking
for
was
the
$412?
unknown
speaker
and
in
each
instance
did
he
get
a
response
from
the
employer
to
his
demand?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
simply
didn't
answer
him?
unknown
speaker
no
explanation
of
any
kind?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
answer.
did
you
say
they
could
have
made
the
tender
before
or
after
suit?
unknown
speaker
where
would
they
have
made
the
tender
before
suit
was
filed?
they
could
have
just
paid
him
the
$412,
which
would
have
left
in
dispute
any
of
the
penalty
wages.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
my
question
is...
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
if
they
wanted
to
still
dispute
the
$412,
but
pay
it
into
court
somewhere,
where
could
they
have
paid
it
before
suit
was
filed?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
again,
they
withheld
$412.
now,
the
penalty
is
two
days
wages
full,
full
two
days?
it
isn't
just
twice
what
they've
withheld?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
a
sum
equal
to
what
they
have
withheld?
unknown
speaker
does
that
suggest,
mr.
chaffin,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
equitable
defense
at
all?
unknown
speaker
do
our
cases
touch
on
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
any
equitable
defenses?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
did
in
the
pacific
mail
case
draw
into
consideration
the
fact
that
a
judgment
had
been
entered
and
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
appeal
it.
unknown
speaker
post...
you
know,
post
to
that
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
i'm
making
the
suggestion
is
that
sometimes
you
can
look
at
post-occurrence
facts.
unknown
speaker
they
said
there
was
sufficient
cause
for
appeal.
they
read
the
word
"sufficient
cause"
to
apply
to
a
later
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
what
if
an
employer,
upon
receiving
the
demand,
simply
said,
you're
wrong,
you
have
not
any
wages
coming,
and
then
there
was
a
dispute.
then
would
it
turn
on
what
the
court
would
ultimately
find
on
whether
at
first
there
was
a
bona
fide
dispute,
and
second,
whether
their
conduct
was,
using
these
strong
terms
that
have
been
mentioned--
unknown
speaker
--tender
them,
tender
the
wages
claimed
in
full
settlement
and
final,
binding
disposition
of
all
pending
claims?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
would
be
the
way
to
wash
it--
unknown
speaker
--all
he
would
have
to
do
is
tender
$412
to
stop
the
accumulation
of
any
penalty?
unknown
speaker
he'd
have
to
do
that
within
the
time,
the
two-day
time
period?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
be
penalty...
if
he
delays
until
after
the
two-day
time
period,
even
if
for
only
ten
days,
there
are
penalty
wages
at
least
for
the
ten
days?
unknown
speaker
but
in
1890
the
seamen
were
not
organized.
the
seamen
were
not
organized.
unknown
speaker
they
still
got
a
pretty
good
result.
unknown
speaker
and
furthermore,
they
got
the...
it
used
to
be...
in
1898
it
was
one
day's
pay.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
mandatory.
unknown
speaker
could
that
have
been
because
congress
thought
they
needed
protection?
unknown
speaker
do
they
still
need
that
protection?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
they've
got
a
union,
they're
organized.
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
talked
to
any
captains
recently?
mr.
chaffin,
i
know
you
think
you
answered
this,
the
question
my
brother
powell
asked
you
earlier.
what's
the
starting
date
for
the
penalty
wages
under
your
submission?
what
day?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
april
1
what
year?
unknown
speaker
and
what's
the
terminal
date?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
the
double
wages
for
that
period
from
april
'76
to
1980--
unknown
speaker
--that
brings
out
the
$300,000?
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
terminate
with
the
rendering
of
the
district
court's
judgment?
unknown
speaker
that
it
automatically
terminates
or
that
it
terminates
only
if
the
employer
had
good
reason
to
appeal,
or--
unknown
speaker
--would
the
stringent
provisions
of
the
statute
that
you
have
just
referred
to,
harsh
you
called
them,
be
tolled
if
the
employer
had
tendered
$412
into
a
court
to
be
impounded
until
the
case
was
resolved?
would
that
stop
it?
unknown
speaker
on
that
one
point,
is
there
statutory
support
for
your
suggestion
that
that
tender
of
that
amount
would
be
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
that's
based
on
a
court,
one
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
agree
with
him
that
if
you
had
tendered
the
$412
at
any
time
the
accrual
would
have
stopped?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
including
tendering
it
to
a
court
to
be
impounded,
or
must
it
have
been
given,
tendered
to
the
party,
the
employee?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
permits
it,
though?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goller,
may
i
ask,
i
gather
the
district
judge
picked
a
30-day
period.
that
was
approximately
the
time
the
petitioner
was
out
of
work,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
he
was
actually
out
of
work
for
how
many
days?
unknown
speaker
34.
and
the
district
judge
gave
the
penalty
wages,
as
i
understand
it,
for
approximately
30
days,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
34.
so
he
picked
the
time
that
he
was
actually
out
of
work
as
the
limit
of
his
entitlement--
unknown
speaker
--to
the
wages.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
suppose
he
had
been
out
of
work
only
two
or
three
days.
do
you
suppose
that
would
have
been
a
fair
limit?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of--
unknown
speaker
--as
an
equitable
matter?
unknown
speaker
as
an
equitable
matter?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there
a
problem
whether
the
statute
permits
that
interpretation
of
authorizing
the
district
judge
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
indicate
why
the
wages
weren't
paid
over?
unknown
speaker
some
basis
for
an
equitable
discretion?
unknown
speaker
did
he
make
a
demand
for
his
wages
in
antwerp?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
find
he
did?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no...
was
it
denied?
did
the
employer
deny
that
he
made
such
a
demand?
unknown
speaker
that
the
demand
was
made
was
just
not...
and
the
money
was
just
not
paid?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
that
in--
--that
isn't
even
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
could
you
cite
to
someplace
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
where
he
makes
a
finding
on
that?
unknown
speaker
he
found
it
was
callous
also.
unknown
speaker
aren't
we
bound
by
those
findings,
counsel?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
read
discretion
into
the
language
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
just
because
it's
an
admiralty
court
we
have
to
read
in
discretion?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i'm
still
worried
about...
knowing
all
of
this
that
you
talked
about,
and
your
client
knew
all
of
this,
why
couldn't
they
have
gotten
out
of
this
for
$400?
why?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
choose
not
to?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting--
--which
is
what
congress
didn't
want
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
and
$300,000
would
break
you
of
that.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
is
strange,
after
the
lawsuit
was
started...
at
least
that
somebody
in
the
company
must
have
known
the
lawsuit
was
going
on.
unknown
speaker
what
about
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
claim
merges
in
the
judgment
and
once
you
have
a
judgment
the
rules
governing
payment
of
judgments
would
govern,
rather
than
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
when
you
were
in
the
district
court,
were
you
then
principally
litigating
the
question
of
whether
the
$412
was
due
or
was
the
litigation
focusing
on
the
penalty
provisions?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
cases
which
give
any
intimation
that
the
earnings
from
other
employment
are
to
be
credited
against
the
ultimate
amount
of
the
claim,
as
would
be
the
case
with
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
laws
in
denying
employment,
something
of
that
kind?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
any
proffer
of
evidence
of
wages
from
other
jobs
by
way
of
mitigation?
unknown
speaker
was
that
proffer
accepted
by
the
district
court
or
refused?
unknown
speaker
you
said
earlier
in
your
argument
that
your
view
is
that
these
amounts
are
paid
as
wages?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
was
working
somewhere
else
and
making
comparable
wages?
unknown
speaker
as
the
chief
justice
says,
a
normal
rule
would
be
to
set
off,
to
set
off
amounts
earned
elsewhere.
unknown
speaker
well,
has
there
ever
been
any
decisions
denying
it?
unknown
speaker
certainly
none
here,
are
there?
unknown
speaker
you
spoke
of
the
failure
to
pay
the
$412
in
antwerp
on
demand,
the
demand
of
which
the
company
seemed
to
be
perhaps
not
fully
aware,
that
it
was
a
result
of
inadvertence.
now,
you
mean
the
kind
of
inadvertence
that
takes
eight
days
to
get
a
letter
from
baltimore
to
washington,
or
what
kind
of
inadvertence
do
you
mean?
did
somebody
just
drop
the
ball,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
certainly
not
what
the
district
court
said.
the
district
court
said
the
refusal
to
pay
unearned
wages
to
claimant
constituted
arbitrary,
unreasonable,
callous
and
willful
disregard
of
the
plaintiff's
rights.
that
certainly
doesn't
square
with
your
answer
that
it's
an
inadvertent
thing.
unknown
speaker
did
you
ever
challenge
any
of
the
district
court's
findings?
did
you
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
you
haven't
cross-appealed
from
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
bound
by
those
findings?
unknown
speaker
your
only
challenge
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
entitled
to...
and
the
district
court...
entitled
to
read
the
statute
as
they
did
read
it?
you're
not
challenging
the
$23,000
recovery?
unknown
speaker
or
the
$412
of
wages?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
what
his
earnings
were...
you
made
a
proffer...
what
his
earnings
were
with
the
other
employer?
was
it
at
the
same
rate,
a
comparable
rate?
unknown
speaker
did
he
work
continuously
from
the
time
he
went
back
to
work?
unknown
speaker
but
not
continuously?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goller,
i
gather
your
whole
case
turns
on
our
accepting
your
submission
that
because
it's
in
admiralty
the
statute
necessarily,
in
its
application
in
admiralty,
is
conditioned
on
an
equitable
discretion
in
the
trial
judge
to
do
what
he
thinks
is
the
just
thing
to
do
in
terms
of
fixing
a
penalty
period?
unknown
speaker
the
harsh
terms
of
the
district
court's
finding,
apparently
tasked
in
terms
of
the
traditional
analysis
of
this
statute,
hardly
laid
a
very
good
foundation
for
his
invoking
equitable
discretion,
would
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goller,
i
could
understand
an
argument
about
discretion
better
if
there
was
some
defensible
reason
given
for
the
failure
to
pay.
if
there
was
a
dispute
over
whether
there
was
cause
for
withholding
or
not,
you
might
say
that
the
congress
certainly
didn't
intend
to
impose
this
penalty
if
there
was
an
arguable,
reasonably
arguable
reason
for
withholding.
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
any
justifiable
cause
for
withholding,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
this
is
just
a
pure...
this
is
just
a
pure
argument
that,
even
though
we
deliberately
withheld
it,
we
nevertheless...
there's
nevertheless
discretion
to
disregard
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be.
as
justice
rehnquist
says,
if
there
were
different
findings
it
might
help
you.
but--
--of
course,
if
there
were
different
findings
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
penalty
wages.
they
had
to
make
the
finding
of
deliberate
withholding
to
justify
even
one
day's
penalty
wage.
unknown
speaker
what
is
equitable
reason?
there's
too
much
money?
unknown
speaker
so
they
can't
have
a
case
where
there'd
be
discretion
if
you
are
bound
by
the
findings.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's...
to
say
it's
without
sufficient
cause
is
one
thing.
to
say
it's
unreasonable,
callous
and
willful
disregard
is
another.
i
mean,
the
district
court
wouldn't
have
had
to
make
those
findings
in
order
to
find
that
it
was
without
sufficient
cause.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
require
the
malicious
type
finding
in
order
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
it
was
without
sufficient
cause?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
order
to
find
any
penalty
wages,
he
had
to
find
this
kind
of
malice--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
fifth
circuit.
certainly
the
statute
doesn't
require
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
we're
bound
by
the
statute,
i
take
it,
not
by
the
fifth
circuit's
rule.
but
the
statute
as
construed
in
the
fifth
circuit
requires
it.
unknown
speaker
what
case
requires
it,
by
the
way?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
the
fifth
circuit
you
think
that
if
the
trial
judge
thought,
well,
it
was
reasonably
arguable
when
they
denied
it,
it
wasn't
malicious,
then
there
would
be
discretion?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
even
need
that.
they
say
there
is
discretion
even
if
it
were
malicious.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were
findings...
there
were
findings
that
it
was
malicious,
or
something
to
that
effect,
anyway.
and
yet
they
didn't
allow
the
penalty
to
stand.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but
they
certainly
didn't
allow
the
running
beyond
the
34
days.
unknown
speaker
you
referred
to
a
case,
i
think
american
federation
against
dahl,
but
i
don't
see
it,
under
that
caption
at
least,
cited.
unknown
speaker
yes,
by
all
means.
perhaps
i
got
the
title
wrong.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
let
me
ask
one
question
that
may
be
pretty
remote
from
the
issue.
i
notice
the
statute
didn't
apply
to
whaling
vessels.
why
not,
i
wonder?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
explains
that?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
that.
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
to
me
the
whaling
vessel
example
would
have
fallen
right
within
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
the
conflict
arose
in,
what
was
it,
about
1966
or
'67?
was
there
a
conflict
before
then?
when
was
the
third
circuit
case
decided?
i
had
the
impression
that
for
about
50
years
the
statute
was
consistently
construed
to
allow
the
district
judge
discretion.
in
the
caribbean
case,
the
court
of
appeals
cites
as
authority
the
mystic
case
in
20
federal
second.
unknown
speaker
that's
fairly--
--that's
a
case
that
holds
there's
discretion,
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chaffin,
of
course
we
know
the
general
proposition
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
expressed
so
well
that
if
a
statute
is
clear
you
don't
need
to
look
to
the
legislative
history.
but
do
you
think
congress
ever
contemplated
the
possibility
of
a
$320,000
payment
for
a
$412
default?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
proportion.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
perhaps
more
accurate
to
say
that
congress,
as
they
often
do,
never
gave
it
any
thought
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
question
on
your
theory.
when
the
statute
before
1950
had
the
"not
more
than"
language
in
it,
did
it...
was
it
not
true
that
the
district
judge
then
had
discretion
within
the
ten-day
range?
unknown
speaker
and
now
by
limiting
the
ten-day
ceiling...
they
took
the
ten-day
ceiling...
is
it
also
clear
they
took
away
his
discretion?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
two
different
things
that
that
one
amendment
accomplished,
then.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
make
it
clear
that
they
intended
to
do
both?
one,
it
removed
the
limit
on
his
discretion.
did
it
also
entirely
take
away
the
discretion?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
could
exceed
ten
days.
unknown
speaker
$130
million.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
for
50
years
the
courts
of
appeals
consistently
misconstrued
the
statute
and
congress
did
nothing
about
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
what
applied?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
going
to
get
into
maxims
you're
up
against
the
proposition
that
courts
abhor
a
forfeiture
too,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
abhor
a
forfeiture,
which
this
really
is.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
take
on
the
appearance
at
least
of
a
forfeiture
in
traditional
terms
when
the
sanction
or
the
penalty
is
so
out
of
proportion
to
the
injury
that
then
courts
have
construed
such
things
as
forfeitures?
unknown
speaker
just
one
more
question.
suppose,
if...
and
i
underline
the
"if"...
the
court,
this
court,
concluded
that
the
fifth
circuit
standard,
its
rule,
was
not
correct.
would
it
be
an
appropriate
remedy
to
declare
that
that
was
an
improper
standard
and
send
it
back
to
return
to
the
district
court,
so
that
the
district
court
could
reexamine
it
in
light
of
what
we
would
have
then
said
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute?
would
that
be
the
solution?
unknown
speaker
rather
than
an
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
i
put
an
"if";
i
put
a
hypothetical
to
it.
if
we
concluded
that
their
standard
was
wrong,
would
that
be
the
appropriate
disposition
of
the
case?
