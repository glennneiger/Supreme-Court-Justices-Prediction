mr.
theodore
goller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
but
a
single
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
had
discretion
to
determine
the
period
for
which
the
penalty
under
section
596
of
title
46
would
run.
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
hear
counsel
say
this
morning
that
the
time
of
the
penalty
would
stop
with
the
rendition
of
the
district
court's
decree,
because
everything
that
he
has
submitted
has
indicated
that
the
penalty
would
simply
run
on
into
perpetuity
until
paid;
a
literal
wording
of
the
statute
would
require
that
result.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
think
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
goller
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
goller
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
specifically
passing
on
this
point.
there
are
suggestions
in
the
cases
that
the
funds
might
have
been
tendered
in
some
fashion.
but
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
where
it
specifically
has
been
held.
mr.
theodore
goller
the
statute
says
nothing
about
it.
the
statute
is
silent
on--
mr.
theodore
goller
--may
i
expand
on
the
facts--
mr.
theodore
goller
--just
a
little
bit
for
the
court's
edification?
this
petitioner
was
a
welder
by
trade
who
was
employed
by
contract
with
my
client
in
new
orleans
to
go
to
antwerp
to
join
a
pipelaying
barge
that
was
then
being
made
ready
to
go
into
the
north
sea
and
conduct
pipelaying
operations.
in
the
contract
it
provided
that
the
employer
would
be
entitled
to
deduct
from
his
pay
$137.50
for
each
of
the
first
pay
periods,
to
be
applied
against
his
return
transportation
in
the
event
that
he
breached
his
contract.
maybe
his
girl
friend
would
write
him
and
say,
i
want
you
home,
so
he
got
the
first
airplane
home
and
came
back
to
the
united
states.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
provision
in
the
contract.
when
he
arrived
in
antwerp
he
worked
on
the
pipelaying
barge
in
the
harbor
for
the
period
from
march
7,
1976,
until
april
7...
i'm
sorry,
april
1,
1976,
which
was
the
day
that
he
had
difficulty
with
his
preexisting
hemorrhoids
and
went
into
the
hospital
at
antwerp
for
treatment
for
the
hemorrhoid
condition.
when
he
came
out
of
the
hospital
he
was
offered
the
option
of
taking
care
of
himself
at
antwerp
or
coming
home
to
make
his
recovery.
he
chose
to
come
home.
in
fact,
he
purchased
his
airplane
ticket
while
he
was
still
in
the
hospital,
before
he
ever
reported
back
to
the
barge.
he
returned
to
houston.
he
was
seen
a
couple
of
times
by
a
colon
specialist
in
houston,
a
rectal
specialist.
he
was
pronounced
fit
for
duty
on
may
3,
1976.
he
actually
did
go
back
to
work
for
another
employer
in
the
north
sea
in
the
same
type
of
employment
on
may
the
5th,
1976.
so
the
period--
mr.
theodore
goller
--34
days.
mr.
theodore
goller
for
exactly
34
days,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
goller
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
goller
and
he
doubled
his
straight
time
wages
of
$101.20
a
day
to
arrive
at
a
figure
of
$202.40
a
day,
times
34
days,
and
it
figures
out
to
exactly
$6,881.
mr.
theodore
goller
well,
of
course,
we
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
determination
of
the
penalty
period
for
which
the
statute
should
run
should
rest
entirely
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge--
mr.
theodore
goller
--or
of
this
court...
excuse
me?
mr.
theodore
goller
sir?
mr.
theodore
goller
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
the
first,
the
second,
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
circuits
have
adopted
that
position.
the
only
circuits
that
have
held
to
the
contrary
are
the
third
and
the
ninth,
the
ninth
based
on
a
third
circuit
decision
which
we
believe
to
be--
mr.
theodore
goller
--if
one
should
look
literally
at
nothing
but
the
words
of
the
statute,
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
theodore
goller
mr.
justice--
mr.
theodore
goller
--mr.
justice,
there
is
not.
and
again,
if
i
may
expand
on
the
facts
a
little
bit,
when
this
gentleman
left
antwerp
to
come
back,
as
the
record
will
reveal,
the
exhibits
will
reveal,
there
were
telephone
calls
made
from
the
new
orleans
office
of
oceanic
contractors,
the
respondent,
attempting
to
get
back
in
touch
with
him,
to
get
him
to
return
to
work.
there
are
telex
messages
that
were...
between
oceanic--
mr.
theodore
goller
--he
says
he
did.
mr.
theodore
goller
the
district
court
found
he
did.
there's
a
matter
in
dispute--
mr.
theodore
goller
--i
don't
recall
that
the
employers,
the
testimony
that
we
put
on
at
the
trial
really
went
to
that
point.
so
we've
assumed
that
the
district
judge
is
correct
in
the
handling
of
the
case
and
have
really
not--
mr.
theodore
goller
--mr.
justice
white,
the
reason
that
the
demand...
the
money
was
not
paid,
if
the
demand
was
in
fact
made,
was
because
we
expected
him
to
come
back
to
antwerp
and
go
back
to
work
and
honor
his
contract.
mr.
theodore
goller
that
he
was
coming
back?
mr.
theodore
goller
the
testimony
in
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
shows
that
very
clearly.
mr.
justice
brown--
mr.
theodore
goller
--i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
finding.
i'm
simply
reciting
the
evidence
as
it
appeared
in
the
district
court.
the
district
judge
did
find
that
the
withholding
of
the
$412.50
was
without
sufficient
cause.
we
do
not
contest
that
at
all.
mr.
theodore
goller
he
did.
mr.
theodore
goller
yes.
we
have
not
contested
the
findings,
and
i
think
under
rule
56
you
are
bound
here,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
think
you
really
have
to
look
at
the
history
of
the
statute
itself
and
to
realize
an
consider
the
role
of
the
admiralty
courts.
the
admiralty
courts
have
been
accepted
as
the
protectors
of
seamen's
rights
from
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
originally
in
1790.
and
that's
shown
by
a
clear
reading
of
the
statute,
because
the
statute
itself
provides
that
the
master
must
respond
in
admiralty.
congress
as
early
as
1790
was
aware
and
knew
that
this
statute
would
be
construed
in
an
admiralty
court.
and
when
you...
as
it
comes,
as
it
is
reenacted--
mr.
theodore
goller
--i
say,
yes,
your
honor,
because
it
is
an
admiralty
court
and
because
the
admiralty
courts
have
traditionally
been
the
protectors
of
the
seamen's
rights,
i
say
that
congress
enacted
this
statement
with
that
knowledge
beforehand,
with
the
understanding
that
the
admiralty
courts
would
protect
the
rights
of
these
seamen.
judge--
mr.
theodore
goller
--your
honor,
i
suppose--
mr.
theodore
goller
--with
hindsight
i
think
this
is
exactly
what
happened.
the
petitioner
came
back
to
the
united
states.
the
operational
office
was
in
antwerp,
and
i
think
it
really
was
a
matter
of
inadvertence,
despite
what
judge
justice
found,
that
they
didn't
make
the
payment.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
goller
that's
right.
your
honor,
the
same
thing
would
be
true
if
one
dollar
were
inadvertently
withheld
as
a
consequence
of
an
honest
mistake.
if
there
is
no
finding
of
sufficient
cause,
the
penalty
over
the
period
of
four
and
a
half
years
or
whatever
it
is,
some
1600
days,
would
result
in
a
payment
of
$324,000.
mr.
theodore
goller
they
did,
your
honor.
and
that
is
of
course
the
reason
that
the
respondent
paid
off
the
judgment
in
september
1980.
the
judgment
was
paid
september
17th,
1980.
but
we
think
that
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
itself
is
a
remedial
statute.
it's
not
a
penalty
statute.
it's
not
penal
in
nature.
the
statute
provides
that
these
sums
shall
be
recoverable
as
wages,
not
as
penalties.
and
if
we
turn
to
this
court's
holding
in
pacific
mail
against
schmidt,
we
say
that
that
case
is
direct
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
has
discretion
for
setting
the
time
of
the
penalty.
in
that
case
a
seaman
who
returned
from
a
foreign
voyage
was
paid
his
wages
through
a
date,
september
23,
1913.
he
stayed
on
the
vessel
for
seven
or
eight
days
later
and
then
was
discharged
when
they
found
some
silverware
missing
and
accused
him
of
taking
it.
so
they
offset
the
value
of
the
silverware
against
the
wages
due
him
for
those
eight
days.
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
the
offset
was
unlawful,
was
without
sufficient
cause,
and
invoked
the
penalty
up
until
the
date
of
trial,
which
was
a
date
like
november,
45
days
or
so.
the
court
of
appeals
extended
that
penalty
through
the
date
of
the
appeal.
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court,
the
court
held
that
there
was
sufficient
cause
for
taking
the
appeal
and
therefore
period
of
the
penalty
would
be...
would
stop
as
of
the
date
of
the
district
court's
decree.
now,
logically,
once
there
is
a
finding
that
the
wages
were
withheld
without
sufficient
cause,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
no
court
after
that
can
come
along
and
say
that
the
penalty
will
run
for
30
days
or
60
days
or
90
days
and
then
the
penalties
shall
stop,
because
if
you
read
the
statute
literally
the
penalty
is
payable,
if
it
is
a
penalty,
is
payable
for
each
and
every
day
that
payment
is
withheld.
so
literally
it's
payable
until
paid,
which
in
our
case
frankly
would
be
september
17,
1980.
mr.
theodore
goller
that
is
not
what
this
court
held
in
pacific
mail.
what
this
court
did
hold
in
pacific
mail
was
that
there
was
sufficient
cause
for
the
shipowner
taking
the
appeal
from
the
district
court's
judgment,
and
that's
all
that
it
held.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
merger
under
the
circumstances,
if
you
read
the
statute
literally.
mr.
theodore
goller
mr.
chief
justice,
the
litigation
focused
on
every
aspect
of
the
case,
and
that
is
why
judge
justice
rendered
the
opinion
he
did.
he
found
the
vessel
to
be
unseaworthy,
on
the
issue
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
circumstances
of
this
accident.
he
awarded
$5,000
as
general
damages
for
the
injuries
caused
by
the
unseaworthiness.
he
found
that
respondent
also
failed
to
pay
maintenance
for
this
period
from
the
date
of
the
accident
up
until
may
3,
when
the
petitioner
was
found
fit
for
duty.
so
he
awarded
not
only
the
maintenance,
but
he
awarded
a
sum
for
attorney's
fees
under
this
court's
decision
in
vaughn
against
atkinson,
that
the
failure
to
pay
maintenance
was
improper.
mr.
theodore
goller
there
are
no
such
direct
holdings
to
our
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
goller
yes,
we
did.
we
showed
the
petitioner's
wages
for
viking
offshore
company,
which
is
the
company
that
he
commenced
working
for
on
may
5,
1976,
which
was
34
days
after
his
accident.
mr.
theodore
goller
it
was
accepted
in
the
sense
that
we
feel
that
all
those
factors
came
into
the
district
court's
decision
in
setting
the
penalty
period
at
34
days,
the
time
that
he
returned
to
work.
that's
what
he
specifically
considered.
mr.
theodore
goller
yes,
sir,
under
the
statute.
the
statute
says
specifically
they
shall
be
recoverable
as
wages.
mr.
theodore
goller
well,
i
think
the
statute
is
speaking
to
the
fact
that
these
sums
to
be
recovered
will
be
wages
and
not
penalties,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
know
of
no
decisions
permitting
a
setoff
in
these
cases.
mr.
theodore
goller
not
that
i
can
recall,
and
i
can't--
mr.
theodore
goller
--there
are
none.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
think
that
is
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
the
petitioner
returned
to
the
pipelaying
barge
following
his
discharge
from
the
hospital
in
antwerp--
mr.
theodore
goller
--well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
going
back
and
drawing
on
the
facts,
the
transcript,
the
testimony
that
was
in
evidence.
mr.
theodore
goller
we
did
not.
mr.
theodore
goller
we
did
not.
mr.
theodore
goller
we
are
bound
by
those
findings,
and
i
understand
that.
we--
mr.
theodore
goller
--we
are
not.
mr.
theodore
goller
we
are
not.
so
far
as
we
know,
that
$412.50
was
not
in
fact
paid,
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
it
was
not
paid.
the
only
thing
that
we
are
saying
is
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
in
exercising
his
discretion
to
limit
the
period
of
the
penalty
and
that
he
has
that
discretion,
and
that
is
vested
in
the
admiralty
courts.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
do
not
know
the
rate.
there
is
evidence
in
the
form
of
an
exhibit
in
the
file
showing,
i
believe,
what
his
earnings
were.
and
as
i
recall,
it
was
around
$6500
for
a
short
period
of
time.
there
is
evidence--
mr.
theodore
goller
--he
worked
for
a
short
period--
mr.
theodore
goller
--not
continuously.
nor
would
he
have
worked
continuously
for
the
respondent,
because
the
pipelaying
season
lasts
in
the
north
sea
only
from
the
time
the
vessels
can
get
out
in
the
spring
until
they
have
to
come
in
in
the
fall.
and
there
was
a
finding,
as
i
recall,
by
the
trial
judge
that
the
pipelaying
season
would
have
terminated
on
september
15
of
1976.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
feel
that's
a
fair
summation
of
our
position,
based
upon
the
decisions
of
the
first,
second,
fourth
and
fifth
circuits.
we
feel
the
only
case
to
the
contrary
really
is
the
swain
case
of
the
third
circuit
and
that
the
swaine
court
simply
misinterpreted
this
court's
holding
in
the
pacific
mail
versus
schmidt
case,
because
in
that
case
that's
exactly
what
this
court
did.
after
the
penalty
had
been
invoked,
had
been
triggered
and
had
run
for
some
period
of
time,
as
i
recall
around
45
to
60
days...
in
any
event,
from
september
13th
to
about
november
the
11th...
then
this
court
held
that
the
penalty
should
cease
at
that
time.
so
if
we
read
the
statute
literally
this
court
would
not
be
empowered
to
make
that
holding.
now,
it
did
it,
the
court
did
this,
by
saying
that
there
was
sufficient
cause
for
the
appeal.
but
if
we
accept
petitioner's
argument
and
literally,
slavishly,
blindly
apply
this
statute,
then
it
would
go
on
and
on
and
on
forever
until
paid.
mr.
theodore
goller
yes,
unless...
and
if
you
view
simply
that
finding
without
him
taking
into
consideration
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case...
the
fact
that
the
injuries
were
very
minor
in
nature,
that
when
the
petitioner
returned
to
the
united
states
he
saw
the
physician
only
twice
and
within
a
period
of
31
days
he
was
declared
fit
for
duty,
and
the
fact
that
he'd
had
a
prior
hemorrhoid
condition
and
this
was
simply
a
recurrence
of
it,
that
he
went
right
back
to
work
and
was
able
to
perform
his
work
as
well
as
he
had
prior
to
the
injury.
mr.
theodore
goller
well,
i
think
there
is,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
goller
well,
i
think
there
is
only
when
you
consider
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
all
of
the
evidence
the
judge
had
before
him
when
he
decided
this
case.
mr.
theodore
goller
to
justify
any
penalty
it
had
to
be
without
sufficient
cause.
mr.
theodore
goller
sir?
mr.
theodore
goller
there
had
to
be
a
finding
of
without
sufficient
cause
in
order
to
trigger
the
statute
initially.
and
whether
you
word
it
as
callous,
arbitrary,
willful,
wanton,
or
whatever,
there
has
to
be
that
finding.
mr.
theodore
goller
well,
again
all
i
can
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
is
what
this
particular
trial
judge
did
find.
what
another
trial
judge
might
find
on
the
same
facts
might
be
entirely
different.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
goller
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
goller
the
statute
does
not
require
that.
mr.
theodore
goller
that's
correct.
the
decisional
law
requires
it.
mr.
theodore
goller
american
federation
versus
dahl,
d-a-h-l,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
goller
the
opinion
indicates
that--
mr.
theodore
goller
--if
the
fifth
circuit
had
a
case
where
the
trial
judge
would
simply
hold
that
the
withholding
is
without
sufficient
cause,
i
believe
the
fifth
circuit
would
allow
the
penalty
to
stand.
the
fifth
circuit
does--
mr.
theodore
goller
--well,
it
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
theodore
goller
yes,
your
honor,
the
$6,881.60
is
part
of
the
total
judgment.
mr.
theodore
goller
that's
true,
they
did
not
reverse
the
decision
of
judge
justice
and
reinstitute
the
penalty.
if
the
court
please,
might
i
just
call
attention
to
another
statute
which
this
court
has
interpreted
that
i
think
justifies
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
court
has
discretion
in
interpreting
the
statute.
section
5
of
the
longshore
act
provides
that
the
liability
of
an
employer
for
compensation
under
that
act
shall
be
exclusive
and
in
place
of
all
other
liability
to
the
injured
longshoreman
or
anyone
entitled
to
recover
compensation
under
that
longshoreman.
yet...
when
you
read
that
statute,
the
literal
wording
of
the
statute,
you
read
it
clearly,
that's
what
it
says
and
that's
all
it
says.
yet
this
court
in
reid
against
yaka
and
in
jackson
versus
lykes
brothers
held
that
where
a
longshoreman
is
employed
directly
by
a
compensation-paying
employer
who
is
also
a
shipowner,
then
the
shipowner
is
not
immune
from
tort
liability
and
the
longshoreman
may
sue
the
shipowner
directly
for
damages
under
the
general
maritime
law.
specifically,
those
cases
held
that
he
had
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
for
unseaworthiness.
now,
that
statute
was
amended
in
1972
and
the
longshoreman's
remedy
for
unseaworthiness
was
eliminated.
since
that
time
the
appellate
courts
have
held
that
the
longshoreman
nevertheless
still
retains
his
direct
action
against
his
employer
under
the
principles
of
maritime
negligence
so
long
as
the
quality
of
the
negligence
that
causes
the
accident
is
negligence
in
the
navigation
of
the
vessel.
courts
have
distinguished
negligence
in
loading
the
cargo
on
the
vessel,
which
is
normally
longshore
work,
and
navigation
of
the
vessel,
which
is
operation
of
the
ship.
and
i
cite
those
cases
to
you
simply
to
reaffirm
that,
although
the
literal
wording
of
the
statute
in
question
may
say
that
the
two
days
wages
or
the
double
wages
are
payable
until
paid,
certainly
this
longshore
statute
shows
clearly
that
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
obviously
have
the
right
to
interpret
these
statutes
to
divine
the
intent
of
congress.
i
think
the
history
of
this
statute
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
turn
its
administration
over
to
the
federal
admiralty
courts,
and
if
congress
had
been
dissatisfied
with
it
it
would
have
amended
the
statute,
because
for
many
years
these
cases
have
been
on
the
books
allowing
the
courts
to
exercise
their
discretion
in
determining
the
period
of
the
penalty.
mr.
theodore
goller
may
i?
mr.
theodore
goller
sorry,
your
honor,
i
may
have
gotten
my
tongue
twisted.
it's
caribbean
federation
lines
versus
dahl.
that's
the
fifth
circuit
case
on
the
point.
mr.
theodore
goller
i
would--
mr.
theodore
goller
--no.
the
statute
also
does
not
apply
to
fishing
vessels
in
general,
because--
mr.
theodore
goller
--the
seamen
on
those
vessels
are
paid
by
shares
or
by
the
catch.
mr.
theodore
goller
incidentally,
if
i
may
refer
back
to
pacific
mail
against
schmidt,
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
there
was
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
should
be
invoked
at
all
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
because
the
petitioner
in
the
case...
or
the
respondent
in
the
case,
the
seaman,
was
injured
while
the
vessel
was
in
port.
and
here
we
have
a
seaman
who
was
injured
while
the
vessel
was
in
port.
so
the
answer
to
this
question
is
not
all
that
clear-cut.
but
at
least
we
feel
that
certainly--
mr.
theodore
goller
--yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
goller
that
is
how
long
the
courts
have
so
held.
thank
you.
