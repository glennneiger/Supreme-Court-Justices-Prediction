mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
involving
the
interpretation
of
a
very
old
seaman's
wage
statute,
a
statute
that
had
its
origin
first
in
1790
and
later
came
to
be
known
as
what
is
known
now
as
the
double
wage
penalty
statute,
which
took
its
present
form
approximately
in
1872.
that
statute
provides
in
essence,
your
honors,
that
if
a
seaman
on
a
foreign
voyage,
such
as
the
petitioner
was
found
to
be
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
is
not
timely
and
properly
paid
his
earned
wages,
those
wages
which
are
rightfully
and
uncontestedly
due
to
him,
one-third
of
those
wages
on
the
date
of
his
discharge
and
the
remainder
within
four
days
thereafter,
that
every
master
or
owner
who
refuses
or
neglects
to
make
payment
without
sufficient
cause
in
the
manner
provided
by
the
statute
shall
pay
to
the
seaman
a
sum
equal
to
two
days
pay
for
each
and
every
day
during
which
such
delay
shall
continue.
your
honors,
that
is
the
heart
of
the
case
here
today.
in
this
particular
case
the
trial
court
found
uncontestedly
that
the
seaman,
the
petitioner,
had
been
denied
by
the
respondent
his
wages,
that
he
had
made
timely
demand
for
his
wages,
and
that
even
though
demand
had
been
timely
made
and
with
diligence
he
had
pursued
his
demand,
that
the
respondent
failed
in
an
unreasonable
manner,
acted
recalcitrantly,
callously,
willfully
and
wantonly
and
failed
to
pay
the
petitioner
his
wages
called
for
by
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
your
honor,
if
i
may
regress
to
the
facts
just
a
little
bit,
the
petitioner
was
actually
due
on
his
discharge
$412.50,
the
amount
of
money
which
had
been
withheld
from
his
pay
check
and
was
to
be
paid
to
him
when
he
was
discharged.
the
actual
facts
are,
your
honor,
that
the
petitioner
was
at
work
as
a
seaman
on
board
the
respondent's
vessel,
which
was
the
lay
barge
27.
he
received
injuries
which
were
due
solely
to
an
unseaworthy
condition
of
that
vessel.
he
had
to
leave
the
vessel
to
have
minor
surgery
and
to
recuperate
from
his
injuries.
he
left
the
vessel,
your
honor,
on
april
the
1st
of
1976.
at
that
time
the
respondent
had
withheld
from
his
paycheck
$412.50
that
was
to
be
paid
to
him
on
the
date
of
his
discharge.
he
was
not
paid
that
money,
your
honor,
and
when
he
was
discharged
in
the
port
of
rotterdam
the
trial
court
found
that
the
respondent
acted
unreasonably,
callously,
willfully
and
wantonly
in
disregard
of
his
rights
to
receive
those
wages.
subsequently,
the
petitioner
attempted
with
due
diligence,
as
the
trial
court
found,
to
collect
those
wages,
but
was
denied
the
wages,
your
honor.
now,
the
real
thrust
of
this
case,
your
honor,
is
not
the
validity
nor
the
applicability
of
this
statute,
but
the
size
of
the
penalty
which
the
statute
carries
with
it.
if
i
may
read
to
the
court
the
one
sentence
in
the
statute
which
i
believe
is
the
heart
of
the
case,
it
reads,
your
honors:
"every
master
or
owner
who
refuses
or
neglects
to
make
payment
in
the
manner
herein
before
mentioned
without
sufficient
cause
shall
pay
to
the
seaman
a
sum
equal
to
two
days
pay
for
each
and
every
day
during
which
payment
is
delayed
beyond
the
respective
period,
which
sum
shall
be
recoverable
as
wages.
"
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that
is,
your
honor.
he
was
awarded
damages
for
injuries
and
for
maintenance
and
cure.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
satisfied
the
judgment
in
full--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--he
has
paid
the
$6800
also,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
issue
before
this
court,
your
honor,
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
could
exercise
its
equitable
discretion
to
shorten
the
running
of
the
penalty
or
to
reduce
the
penalty
to
an
amount
which
is
below
that
called
for
by
the
plain
and
clear
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that
is
the
sole
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
i
suggest
that
the
position
of
the
court
should
be--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--your
honor,
he
does
not
contest
the
$6880.
that
has
been
paid
in
satisfaction
of
judgment.
the
adversary,
the
respondent
here,
my
adversary,
takes
the
position
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
was
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
your
honor,
the
figure
that
i
suggest
will
come
to
something
around
$300,000
when
you
apply
the
statute
exactly
as
written,
the
statute--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--no,
your
honor.
that
question
was
answered
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
pacific
mail
against
schmidt
in
1916,
written
by
justice
holmes,
your
honor.
the
court
there
held--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--the
direct
holding
was
that
the
penalty
would
not
run
during
what
was
there
a
good
faith
appeal,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
whether--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--the
theory
is
not
announced
there
or
not
stated
to
be
discretion
there,
your
honor.
it's
simply
stated
that...
the
court
simply
stated,
i
believe,
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
there
that
that
penalty
should
continue
to
accrue
then.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
well,
your
honor,
in
the
pacific
mail
case
the
trial
court
entered
a
judgment
that
inflicted
the
penalty
up
through
the
date
of
the
decree
of
the
trial
court.
and
the
appellant
sought
to
have
that
decree
reviewed.
the
court
of
appeals
then
acted
to
add
to
the
penalty
during
the
appellate
procedure,
and
the
supreme
court's
action,
your
honor,
was
simply
to
delete
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
added,
but
not
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
where
they
had
exercised
the
penalty
for
the
entire
period
up
until
the
date
of
the
district
court's
decree.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
he
made
an
uneventful
recovery,
your
honor,
and
the
petitioner
does
not
in
this
case
contend
that
the
respondent's
failure
to
pay
his
wages
inflicted
greater
injuries
upon
him,
your
honor.
i
would,
in
reply
to--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--no,
your
honor.
he
had
hospitalization
treatment
in
brussels
and
actually
reported
back
to
the
vessel
while
it
was
still
in
the
port
of
rotterdam,
while
it
was
in
the
port
of
rotterdam.
and
his
superintendent,
his
supervisor,
is
the
individual
who
actually
denied
the
payment
of
his
wages
to
him,
and
that
is
found
by
the
trial
court
in
its
findings
of
fact
and
it's
uncontested.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
he
did
have
a
complete
recovery,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
within
five
weeks
he
had
recovered
and
returned
to
work,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
trial
court
found
that
he
did
press
his
claim
with
due
diligence.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
he
made
telephone
calls,
he
attempted
to
collect
his
wages.
we
also
instituted
suit
within
16
months
following
that,
your
honor,
and
after
the
institution--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--well,
he
tried
without
avail
to
collect
his
wages,
your
honor,
up
until
september
of
the
following
year,
without
the
aid
of
counsel.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
this
case
was
tried
in
sherman,
texas,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
eastern
district
of
texas.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
your
honor,
the
penalty
wage
statute
applies
only
to
seamen's
injuries.
he
would
not
receive
any
penalty
at
all
had
he...
any
recovery
at
all--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--he
would
have
collected
nothing
but
his
actual
damages,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
he
would
have
collected
only
his
actual
damages
in
that
particular
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no,
your
honor.
it
would
be
$412.50
plus
his
attorney's
fees
and
collection--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--no,
your
honor.
we
get
that
amount
solely
because
the
congress
saw
fit
to
pass
a
penalty
provision.
and
if
i
might,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--it
would
have,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
it
would
have.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
by
each
and
every
day.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
what
was
actually
withheld?
your
honor,
he--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--the
actual
mechanism
of
withholding
was
that
he
was
paid
every
two
weeks,
your
honor,
and
that
the
respondent
withheld
$137.50
from
his
paycheck.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
each
two-week
period.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
is
also
an
obligation
under
the
maritime
law
that
in
the
event
that
a
seaman
is
injured
while
in
the
service
of
his
vessel
his
employer
is
required
to
repatriate
him.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
trial
court
so
found,
your
honor.
it
was
withheld
from
his
wages.
he
earned
the
money
and
they
failed
to
pay
him
that
money.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
what
was
refused,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
i
would
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
statute
reads
"without
sufficient
cause"
and
i
would
not
think
that
if
they
had
made
a
simple
clerical
error,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--i
wouldn't
think
it
literally
would...
it
perhaps
might
apply
literally,
your
honor.
but
the
court,
this
very
court,
has
interpreted
the
"without
sufficient
cause"
provision
of
the
statute
to
mean
that
it
must
be
a
callous,
recalcitrant,
unreasonable
withholding.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
i
believe
that
you
would,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
if
i
might
point
out
to
the
court,
your
honor,
there
is
also
a
provision
that
if
the
amount
of
the
wage
is
in
dispute
and
the
employer,
the
respondent,
feels
he
has
a
good
faith
defense
to
that,
then
the
proper
procedure
there,
your
honor,
is
to
tender
that
money
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
let
it
be
known
that
a
dispute
is
had
as
to
that
amount--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
defendant
could
have
tendered
the
money
into
the
trial
court's
registry.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
also
that
throughout
this
case
the
respondent--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--it
is
my
understanding
of
the
case
law,
your
honor,
that
it
would
simply
be
a
tender
of
the
wages
due.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
any
time,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
before
or
after
suit,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
well,
your
honor,
the
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
court
was
that
he
made
the
demand
when
he
left
their
employ,
and
there
were
records,
telephone
records,
that
he
had
telephoned
his
employer
on
several
occasions
previous
to
that...
subsequent
to
that.
in
addition,
he
wrote
them
a
letter
asking
for
his
wages,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
well,
he
was
asking
for
the
$412,
as
well
as
other
elements.
he
was
asking
for
the
money
back
that
he
had
had
to
pay
his
own
way
home.
they
had
lost
some
of
his
personal
effects.
he
was
asking
that
he
be
repaid
those
things.
but
he
was
not
asking
for
any
damages
for
his
injuries,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
in
effect
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
well,
if
he
would
get
a
telephone
call,
he
would
simply
receive
a
reply
that
we're
looking
into
it
or
whatever.
but
at
the
time
f
the
trial,
your
honor,
the
respondent
brought
forth
two
of
their
own
witnesses
from
their
home
office,
and
those
witnesses
did
not
offer
any
reason
or
any
excuse
as
to
why
the
petitioner's
wages
had
never
been
paid.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no
explanation
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
either
way,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
they
could
have
filed
their
own
lawsuit,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
statute
provides,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
sum
recoverable
as
wages,
not
that
it
is
his
wages
that
he
is
recovering,
your
honor.
the
penalty
portion
is
not
a
wage
itself;
it
is
a
sum
recoverable
as
wages,
a
sum
equal
to
two
days
pay.
but
it
is
not
to
be
considered
as
wages,
your
honor.
a
portion
of
the
respondent's,
and
i
think
the
significant
thrust
of
their
argument,
goes
to
the
point
that
in
the
respondent's
opinion
this
is
to
be
considered
as
a
compensatory
or
remedial
measure.
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no,
your
honor.
it
is
a
sum
equal
to
two
days
pay
for
each
and
every
day
during
which
the
withholding
continues.
it
is
not
two
days
wages,
your
honor.
it
is
a
sum
equal
to
that.
and
there
is
a
distinction
there.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
it
is
not,
your
honor.
the
sum
that
they
have
withheld
bears
no
relationship
to
the
penalty
inflicted
by
the
statute.
this
court,
your
honor,
in
1930,
speaking
through
justice
stone
in
a
case
called
collie
against
fergusson,
when
this
very
statute
was
before
the
court
said,
your
honor:
"the
petitioners
argue
that
the
statutory
allowance
is
compensatory.
"
"however,
the
words
'refuses
or
neglects
to
make
payment
without
sufficient
cause'
connote
conduct
which
is
in
some
sense
arbitrary
or
willful,
or
at
least
a
forfeiture
not
attributable
to
impossibility
of
payment.
"
"we
think
the
use
of
this
language
indicates
a
purpose
to
protect
seamen
from
delayed
payment
of
wages
by
the
imposition
of
a
liability
which
is
not
exclusively
compensatory,
but
designed
to
prevent
by
its
coercive
effect
arbitrary
refusals
to
pay.
"
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
equitable
defenses.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
your
honor,
there
is
a
case
out
of
this
court
called
mccrea
against
the
united
states.
that
case
is
once
again
by
justice
stone,
in
1934.
in
that
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
petitioner,
who
was
a
seaman,
urged
on
the
court
that
his
wages
had
been
withheld
from
him
without
sufficient
cause.
the
trial
court
found
that
they
had
not
been
withheld,
but
that
the
seaman
had
not
presented
himself
to
receive
his
wages.
however,
after
that
the
seaman
took
the
position
that
the
failure
to
pay
without
sufficient
cause
activated
the
penalty
even
after
the
period
of
time
at
which
they
are
originally
due
to
him.
mr.
justice
stone
in
that
case,
your
honor,
said
that
you
do
not
consider
events
which
happen
beyond
the
time
period
set
forth
in
the
statute,
that
the
statute
provides
a
reasonable
and
a
definite
manner
in
which
the
seaman
can
recover
the
penalty.
now,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
a
perfect
analogy
to
this
case,
because
what
the
respondent
is
attempting
to
do
here
truly,
your
honor,
is
to
draw
into
issue
facts
that
occurred
after
the
statute
had
been
triggered.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
in
the
pacific
mail
case--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
clearly
distinguishable.
for
one
thing,
in
the
pacific
mail
case--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--your
honor,
yes,
you
can,
your
honor.
but
those
occurrences
they
were
talking
about
there
were
post-judgment
occurrences.
now,
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
also
said,
your
honor,
that
they
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
cause
of
action
had
merged
into
the
judgment,
which
is
the
common
and
ordinary
rule--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
whether,
if
the
employer
owed
the
wages,
your
honor,
the
dispute
would
turn...
or
the
applicability
of
the
statute
would
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
withholding
was
without
sufficient
cause.
now,
if
the
employer
wants
to
take
that
risk
they
may
do
so,
your
honor.
the
more
reasonable
approach
is
to
tender
the
wages,
to
pay
constructively
the
seaman's
wages
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
and
then
proceed
from
that
point
forward.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that
is
the
more
reasonable
approach.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no,
your
honor.
he
can
tender
the
wages
at
any
time
after
the
statute--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--that's
right,
your
honor.
i
point
out
to
the
court,
your
honors,
that
this
statute
had
its
origin
in
1790,
but
in
1872
the
statute
originally
read
that
the
penalty
would
be
a
sum
not
greater
than
two
days
pay
for
a
time
period
not
exceeding
ten
days.
it
gave
the
judiciary
discretion.
that
provision
was
consciously
deleted
from
the
statute
in
1898
by
the
congress,
your
honors,
at
which
time
the
penalty
was
changed
to
read
one
day's
pay
for
each
and
every
day
during
which
the
penalty
continued.
so
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
even
though
it
be
skimpy,
i
would
say
to
the
court
is
contained
actually
in
the
evolution
of
the
statute
itself
in
that
the
statute
originally
contained
a
provision
that
allowed
the
trial
court
discretion.
that
provision
was
removed
by
the
congress,
your
honor.
it
was
a
provision
that
was
removed
after
the
bill
had
been
passed
by
the
fifty-fourth
congress
in
1896
and
went
to
the
senate
in
1898.
so
the
shipping
industry
as
well
as
the
seamen
had
a
perfect
opportunity
to
have
both
of
their
sides
aired,
your
honor,
and
even
with
that
that
was
consciously
deleted.
now,
i
point
out,
your
honor,
that
in
the
case--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--they
were
not
organized
as
well,
your
honor.
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
they
got
a
very
fine
result,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
right,
and
in
1915
it
was
upped
to
two
days
pay.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
mandatory,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that
is
exactly
why
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
why?
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
well,
your
honor,
when
you're
at
sea
and
discharged
in
a
foreign
port
the
union
and
your
organization
may
not
be
nearly
so
assistive
to
you
as
you
might
think,
your
honor.
the
dangers
that
a
seaman--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--under
my
submission,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
the
starting
date
is
april
1,
the
date
that
he--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--1976,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
may
the
6th,
1980,
the
date
of
the
district
court's
decree,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
the
holding
of
pacific
mail,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
there
is
no
authority,
your
honor...
i
suppose
that
if
it
was
a
bad
faith
appeal
that
the
appellate
court
could
continue
to
have
the
penalty
accrue
with
it.
the
standard
rule
of
law,
your
honor,
is
that
every
cause
of
action
merges
into
the
judgment
that's
entered
on
that
cause
of
action.
and
i
see
no
reason
to
distinguish
this
statute
from
that,
your
honor.
other
than
that,
your
honor,
i
would
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
where
neither
the
validity
nor
the
applicability
of
the
statute
is
challenged,
which
it
is
not
here,
your
honor,
and
the
words
of
the
statute
are
plain
and
unambiguous,
that
simply
because
the
statute
brings
with
it
a
harsh
financial
result,
a
severe
penalty,
that
the
courts
cannot
sit
in
review
and
reverse
what
is
a
conscious
decision
of
the
congress.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
a
constructive
payment
of
seaman's
wages,
your
honor.
and
it
would
stop
it,
according
to
case
law.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
no,
your
honor,
it's
based
on
several
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
they
calculated,
thought
of
that
exact
figure.
but
i
would
suggest--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--in
relative
terms
i
think
they
did,
your
honor.
i
think
they
did
in
relative
terms,
your
honor.
i
think
so
clearly
that--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--your
honor,
i
don't
really
think
that
would
be
accurate
in
this
case,
because
the
congress
consciously
deleted
the
1898
which
gave
that
limiting
provision
to
the
courts.
and
the
bill
was
the
subject
of
extended
debate,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
your
honor,
that
what's
really
happening
here
is
that
the
respondent
is
attempting
to
make
a
back-door
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
statute,
your
honors.
the
statute
is
clear
and
plain
on
its
face,
and
that
the
rules
interpreting
the
seaman's
statute
are
even
more
clear,
that
if
there
exists
an
ambiguity
in
a
seaman's
statute
that
ambiguity
must
be
interpreted
in
favor
of
the
seaman.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
well,
your
honors--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--oh,
your
honor,
the
statute
was
clear
on
its
face
saying
that
he
could
not
exceed
ten
days.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
and
when
they
removed
that
after
two
years--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--he
could
after
that
time,
your
honor,
fix
the
running
of
the
statute
according
to
the
terms
of
the
statute.
i
would
suggest,
your
honors,
that
what's
really
at
issue
here
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
wording
of
the
statute.
it
is
the
impact
of
the
statute,
the
financial
burden
which
comes
with
it.
and
i
would
suggest
further,
your
honors,
that
that
is
not
a
proper
matter
for
review
by
this
court,
which
is
backed
up
by
the
case
of
tennessee
valley
authority
against
hill.
in
that
case,
your
honors,
decided
by
the
chief
justice
and
written
by
the
chief
justice,
a
three-inch
fish
stopped
a
$100
million
dam
straight
in
its
tracks,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
$130
million.
so
it's
clear
that
if
the
statute
is
valid,
if
it's
constitutional,
in
the
case
of
the
seaman
he
has
been
a
protected
breed
of
worker
for
several
hundred
years--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--i
have
no
explanation
for
that,
your
honor,
except
to
say
that
the
statute
was
lightly
applied
in
those
days,
and
in
these
days--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--lightly
applied.
you
do
not
find
a
great
judicial
history
on
the
statute,
your
honor.
but
the
case
of
isbrandtsen
against
johnson
came
before
this
case...
this
court...
in
1952
involving
this
statute.
justice
burton
then
said,
your
honor,
that
in
statutes
which
derogate
the
common
law
as
known
to
the
maritime
law,
those
statutes
must
be
strictly
construed
and
construed
in
the
favor
of
the
seaman
if
there
be
a
doubt;
that
legislation
remedial
to
the
seaman
is
to
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
if
there
exists
one
in
favor
of
the
seaman.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
courts
what,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
this
is
not
a
forfeiture,
your
honor.
this
is
a
statute
designed
to
prevent
great
potential
harms.
a
seaman
who
is
discharged
in
a
foreign
port
without
his
wages
can
die
there,
your
honor.
it
is
a
significant
potential
harm
this
statute
is
designed
to
prevent.
it
has
punch
and
impact.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
i
suppose
you
could
take
that
approach,
your
honor.
but
that
approach
is
rejected
by
numerous
cases,
numerous
cases.
the
ryder
against
solartone
case,
an
antitrust
case,
was
the
same
thing.
the
statute
carries
with
it
significant
financial
impact,
and
that
is
in
essence
the
entire
objection
to
the
law,
your
honor.
and
i
just
cannot
buy
that
the
congress
could
not
foresee
that
after
two
years.
it's
an
old
statute
and
it
has
a
punch
and
impact,
which
is
simply
removed
if
you
interpret
it
as
respondent
would
have,
your
honor.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
stabilize
the
law
and
have
a
uniform
period
for
the
running
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
that
would
not
be
my
solution,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
my
solution,
your
honor,
would
be
that
the
case
be
reversed
and
rendered
with
instructions--
mr.
robert
a.
chaffin
--if
that
was
the
conclusion,
your
honor,
i
would
certainly
think
that
you
would
also
have
to
add
too
that
you
could
not
consider
conduct
outside
the
period
of
time
prescribed
by
the
statute.
the
only
equitable
conduct
in
this
case
was
that
the
petitioner
himself
went
out
and
found
reemployment.
now,
equitable
conduct
by
its
nature
refers
to
some
type
of
conduct
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
should
have
come
forward
with.
your
honor,
the
record
is
absolutely
clean
of
any
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
that
they
did
anything
to
help
the
petitioner
collect
money
that
was
rightfully
due
him.
in
other
words,
the
only
equities
in
the
case
actually
fall
on
the
side
of
the
petitioner,
with
the
exception
of
the
one
equity
which
the
respondent
jumps
on,
your
honor,
and
that's
that
it's
a
big
penalty.
