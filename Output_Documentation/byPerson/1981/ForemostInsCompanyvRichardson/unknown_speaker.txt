unknown
speaker
mr.
andrews,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
commercial
flavor?
supposing
this
were
a
rented
boat.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
wondering
about
commercial
pleasure
boating.
if
you
rent
the
boats...
would
that
be
enough
commercial
flavor?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
help
us
to
define...
you
asked
us
to
adopt
the
commercial
flavor
test,
and
i'm
just
trying
to
get
from
you
what
is
it
that
would
give
us
enough
commercial
flavor?
unknown
speaker
really
what
you
are
saying,
i
guess,
is
that
instead
of
using
navigability
as
the
test,
you'd
use
commercial
navigability.
unknown
speaker
wherever
you
have
got
commerce,
then...
whatever,
it's
a
pleasure
boat
or
what--
--then
location
would
be
the
sole
test
if
it
was
on
water
that
was
used
for
commerce.
unknown
speaker
well,
most
boats
have
to
come
to
shore,
and
they
come
into
a
port
through
some
channels.
unknown
speaker
which
are
used
by
pleasure
boats
and
all
other
kinds
of
boats.
you
would
say
even
there,
that
location
would
not
be
the
sole
test.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
require
some
connect...
so
no
pleasure
boat
would
ever
by
covered
by
admiralty.
unknown
speaker
well,
give
me
an
example.
unknown
speaker
if
coming
into
a
harbor
you
collide
with
a
commercial
ship
that
is
maritime,
and
if
you
collide
with
another
pleasure
boat
it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
andrews,
supposing
you
took
the
portion
of
the
intercoastal
waterway
around
the
perimeter
of
florida,
which
is
primarily
used
by
large
numbers
of
pleasure
boats,
yachts
and
things
like
that.
admiralty
jurisdiction
or
not
when
two
pleasure
boats
bump
into
each
other?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
have
to
have
any
commerce
associated
with
the
vessels.
so
i
think
you
are
back
to
location.
what
is
your
test?
unknown
speaker
i'm
looking
at
the
location,
say,
between
palm
beach
and
miami
down
there.
unknown
speaker
and
the
location
is
90
%
pleasure
boats
and
two
pleasure
boats
bump
into
each
other.
unknown
speaker
i
think
along
the
florida
one...
assume
for
my
example
anyway
that
there
is
a
large
amount
of
pleasure
boating
in
a
waterway
and
maybe
an
occasional
commercial
fisherman
or
something,
and
two
pleasure
boats
collide.
unknown
speaker
in
your
example,
the
water
that
you
are
talking
about
would
be
navigable.
it
is
navigable,
those
inland
waterways,
and
error
to
commercial
fishing
boats.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
a
good
enough
connection
with
commerce?
you're
talking
about,
your
honor,
the
type
of
boats
we
are
dealing
with,
so
yes,
i
would
say
no,
it
isn't
good
enough.
and
because
we
are
also
talking
about
the
water
bodies.
as
the
court
is
aware,--
--what
about
justice
stevens'
example
of
90
%
pleasure
boat
water
and
10
%
commercial?
two
pleasure
boats
collide.
you
say
no
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
the
pleasure
boat
collides
with
a
commercial
boat.
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
and
if
two
commercial
ships
collide,
obviously,--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
same
water.
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
in
the
little
area
between
baton
rouge
and
louisiana
if
two
boats
with
two
kids
in
them,
netting
for
crawfish?
i
guess
they
would
be
covered,
too.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder,
do
i
get
you
that
if
the
particular
body
of
water...
for
our
basic
premise,
of
course,
it
is
navigable...
is
a
commercial
highway
of
some
kind,
then
the
fact
that
there's
a
collision
of
two
pleasure
boats
on
the
commercial
highway,
that
is
admiralty?
unknown
speaker
whereas,
as
you
suggest
in
this
case,
the
body
of
water
may
be
navigable
but
it
is
not
a
commercial
highway,
and
therefore,
these
two
pleasure
boats,
it
is
not
admiralty.
but
if
two
commercial
fishermen
collided
at
the
very
spot
that
these
two
collided,
it
would
be
admiralty.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
get
the
courts--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
the
test
were
only
did
it
happen
on
navigable
water,
federally
regulable,
if
it
did,
then
it's
admiralty.
that
would
be
a
much
simpler
test,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
fifth
circuit
say
that
the
test
was
navigable
or
capable
of
being
made
navigable,
so
that
it
isn't
something
that
is
an
automatic
proof
by
simply
looking
at
the
location.
unknown
speaker
and
one
couldn't
apply
their
test
without...
not
knowing
either
whether
the
water
was
navigable
or
whether
it
was
capable
of
being
made
navigable.
unknown
speaker
they
say
it
takes
6a,
if
the
waterway
is
capable
of
being
used
in
commerce.
that
is
the
sufficient
threshold
to
invoke
admiralty
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
that
means
it
has
to
be
navigable,
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
waterway
is
capable
of
being
used
in
commerce.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
or
isn't
it
capable
right
now?
that
is
the
question.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
remanded
it,
didn't
they?
didn't
they
remand--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
navigable?
unknown
speaker
mr.
andrews,
are
you
approaching
your
argument
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
or
statutory
law?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
the
statute,
section
1333,
might
be
narrower
than
article
iii's
language.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
view?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
there
is
a
statute,
it's
46
u.s.
code
section
740,
which
extends
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
to
all
cases
of
damage
or
injury
caused
by
a
vessel
on
navigable
water.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
appear
to
include
pleasure
boats?
unknown
speaker
then,
is
this
case
governed
by
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
not
be
a
correct
interpretation
of
that
language
in
the
statute,
which
certainly
on
its
face
would
literally
include
pleasure
boats
unless
pleasure
boats
are
not
vessels.
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
never
held
they've
gone
too
far,
have
we?
unknown
speaker
and
we've
sustained
those
statutes,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
and
said
that
congress
could
define
those
things
for
us?
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
the
statute
that
justice
o'connor
called
to
your
attention...
it
goes
rather
far,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
may
not
understand
your
argument.
what
is
your
view?
is
there
or
is
there
not
jurisdiction
when
two
airplanes
collide
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic?
unknown
speaker
traditionally,
they
didn't
fly.
unknown
speaker
i
just
didn't
know
what
you
were
arguing.
i'm
still
not
sure.
are
you
saying
there
is
or
is
not
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
it's
a
tough
question.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
if
they
crash
in
the
middle
of
the
altantic
they
are
eventually
going
to
get
down
into
the
water.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out
your
answer.
your
answer
is
yes,
because
it
is
commerce
and
it's
the
location
rule.
unknown
speaker
do
you
get
that
out
of
executive
jet
aviation?
unknown
speaker
your
new
test.
unknown
speaker
what
case
were
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
definition
of
a
navigable
water?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
navigable
from
shore
to
shore.
it
is
not
navigable
up
close
to
the
shore.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
run
the
boat
through
weeds
up
against
the
shore.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
navigable,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
navigable,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
those
streams
i
was
asking
your
opponent
about
between
baton
rouge
and
new
orleans?
those
are--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
those
are
navigable
rivers.
unknown
speaker
and
the
little
rowboats,
they're
not
in
commerce,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
but
i
wouldn't
call
making
50
a
day
making
a
living.
unknown
speaker
the
one
that
goes
for
crawfish
to
eat
himself,
he
is
on
navigable
waters,
he
is
controlled
by
maritime
law.
unknown
speaker
there's
something
wrong
there.
unknown
speaker
he
is
not
a
fisherman;
he
is
out
fishing,
but
that
is
not
his
business.
unknown
speaker
like
these
people
were.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
his
boat
sinks,
he
can
walk
to
shore.
is
that
your
idea
of
navigable
water?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
but
under
the
definition
you
want
and
the
fifth
circuit,
if
it's
a
navigable
stream
in
the
middle,
it's
navigable
for
all
purposes.
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
anything
about
the
depth
of
the
amite
at
the
point
these
boats--
unknown
speaker
--could
the
jurisdictional
issue
possibly
be
resolved
on
the
depth
of
the
water
right
under
the
boats
at
the
time
they
collided?
the
atlantic
ocean
is
very
shallow
right
by
the
shore
and
so
is
the
mississippi
river
with
a
nine-foot
channel
in
the
center.
but
the
entire
river
of
mississippi
is
a
navigable
stream,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
sometimes,
you
open
the
bridge
for
a
small
boat
with
a
very
high
mast.
unknown
speaker
judge
thornberry
would
have
remanded
for
the
sort
of
finding
that
you
suggest
could
be
made
but
wasn't
made...
whether
it
was
commercially
used.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
federal
statutes
defining
the
rules
of
the
road
and
setting
other
safety
measures,
these
statutes
you
refer
to,
are
they
applicable
to
this
river?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
if
in
a
local
suit,
if
there
was
no
admiralty
jurisdiction
under
state
law
they
could
still
say
there
was
negligence
because
of
failure
to
abide
by
some
federal
rule
of
the
road?
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
federal
law
controlling
the
case
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
talk
about
rules
of
the
road
with
admiralty.
because
every
time
i
have
had
an
admiralty
case
and
i
say
try
it
like
two
automobiles,
the
admiralty
lawyers
look
at
me
like
i'm
nuts.
it's
a
little
selected
part
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
to
put
the
pleasure
boats
over
in
there.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
the
same
way
the
state
regulates
one
foot
from
the
water.
if
he's
out
in
the
water
one
foot,
the
state
can
regulate
that
just
as
easily
as
it
could
another
foot,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
in
a
navigable
river,
he's
one
foot
in
it.
unknown
speaker
so
he's
in
navigation.
unknown
speaker
i
still
think
you
have
to
draw
a
line
someplace.
unknown
speaker
well,
draw
it.
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
had
been
in
five
feet
of
water?
and
i
warn
you
i'm
going
to
two.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
source
of
the
rule?
there
must
be
some
connection
with
commerce
or
some
capability
of
commerce
rather
than
navigability.
is
that
the
same?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
are
suggesting
that.
you
just
suggested
that
a
minute
ago.
didn't
the
fifth
circuit
say
that
if
it's...
did
it
say
if
it's
capable
of
being
navigable,
or
if
it's
capable
of
supporting
commerce?
unknown
speaker
just
relying
on
the
daniel
ball,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you've
got
a
200-foot
yacht,
which
is
pure
pleasure,
a
crew
of
40
men.
i
suppose
under
your
theory,
that's
got
to
be
treated
along
with
an
18-foot
boat
with
an
outboard
motor.
used
for
pleasure.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
say
if
you
look
at
waterbound
vessels
alone...
you
mentioned
earlier
the
swimmer
who
hit
something
in
navigable
waters
and
that
was
held
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
would
say
it
was
not
because
he
was
not
aboard
a
waterbound
vessel.
unknown
speaker
and
a
waterskier
similarly?
is
he
on
a
vessel
or--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
boat
the
waterskier
is
being
pulled
by
simply
runs
aground
in
the
shallow?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
pleasure
boat
that
is
involved
in
a
single
boat
accident
resulting
from
a
manufacturer's
defect
in
the
vessel?
still
apply
admiralty
law
to
that
kind
of
case?
unknown
speaker
what
justification
is
there
really
for
denying
the
states
their
traditional
jurisdiction
over
tort
suits
of
that
type?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
of
course,
the
federal
government
has
enacted
laws
such
as
the
55
miles
an
hour
law
governing
automobiles
and
other
automobile
regulations,
but
that
doesn't
result
in
our
depriving
the
states
of
their
traditional
jurisdiction
over
tort
suits
involving
automobiles.
unknown
speaker
but
now
we're
talking
about
the
purely
private
vessel
and
whether
the
state
should
be
deprived
of
jurisdiction
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin,
would
you
say
that...
just
directing
your
attention
to
the
manufacturer's
defect
suggestion.
is
the
issue...
is
unseaworthiness
of
a
vessel
a
traditional
area
of
state
or
federal
jurisdiction,
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
does
the
man
in
the
little
fishing
boat
get
maintenance
inshore
if
he
got
injured?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
he
be
a
seaman?
unknown
speaker
he
was
at
sea,
according
to
you.
unknown
speaker
maritime
law
only
applies
to
sea,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
unknown
speaker
but
for
this
case,
you're
not
interested
in
anything
but
the
collision
part
of
admiralty.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
need
it
for
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
carry
it?
