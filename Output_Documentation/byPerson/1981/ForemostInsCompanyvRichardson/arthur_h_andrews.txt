mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
complaint
that
we
have
with
the
lower
court
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
it,
that
court,
abandoned
any
requirement
of
the
commercial
connection
to
either
the
location
of
this
maritime,
or
so-called
maritime,
collision
and
the
activity
complained
of.
since
this
court's
opinion
in
executive
jet
v.
the
city
of
cleveland,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
debate
as
to
just
what
the
court
meant
in
much
of
the
dicta
in
that
decision
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
decision
was
limited
to
aircraft
crashes
on
navigable
waters.
i
think
that
there
is
uniform
agreement
with
the
scholars
and
courts
that
something
beyond
the
locality
alone
rule
was
required
or
ought
to
be
required,
because
that
locality
alone
rule
does
not
work
so
well
anymore.
there
is
two
fields
of
debate
as
i
recognize
the
issues,
as
to
whether
the
locality
should
be
abandoned
completely
and
that
a
maritime
nexus
alone
should
apply.
i
think
that
the
majority
view,
certainly
the
view
that
i
take
and
i
believe
the
view
taken
by
most
scholars,
is
that
locality
is
still
important.
but
in
addition
to
locality,
there
ought
to
be
something
else.
that
has
been
formulated
i
think
as
the
so-called
locality
plus
rule.
the
plus
that
i
would
add
to
the
occurrence
is
the
plus
of
some
commercial
flavor
to
either
the
location
of
the
wrong
or
the
activities
complained
of.
the
fifth
circuit,
in
its
early
decisions
following
executive
jet;
notably,
peytavin
which
involved
a
collision
of
automobiles
on
a
floating
pontoon
portion
entrance
way
to
the
ferry,
found
that
there
was
no
maritime
jurisdiction
in
that
type
of
action,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you,
kept
a
commercial
flavor
to
it.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
rented
boats
i
don't
think
should
really...
what
are
we
talking
about
in
the
nature
of?
rented
boats
would
certainly...
this
case,
what
makes
this
case
i
think
interesting
and
what
makes
it
here
is
that
we
are
talking
about
commercial
pleasure
boating
in
the
purest
sense,
as
the
district
court
found.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
cannot
honestly
tell
the
court
that
i
can
draw
the
line
so
fine
to
say
that
if
i
was
paddling
a
boat
around,
rented,
on
the
potomac
river
and
it
sunk
because
of
some
defect
in
it,
that
that
ought
to
be
maritime
law.
my
reaction
is
that
it
should
not
be.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
the
way
i
would
approach
the
problem,
as
pointed
out
in
brief
and
which
i
believe
is
supported
by
at
least
benedict,
i
would
use
a
twofold
sort
of
test.
when
we
are
in
the
traditional
blue
water
sea,
more
than
a
marine
league,
away
from
the
shore,
i
would
use
essentially
a
locality
alone
test,
so
that
the
activity
complained
of
would
not
have
to
have
a
very
strong
relationship
to
commerce
in
order
to
support
maritime
jurisprudence
or
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court.
as
i
moved
shoreward
and
got
closer
to
the
beach,
and
as
i
moved
inward,
then
i
would
require
that
the
complained
of
activity
have
some
closer
connection
to
traditional
notions
of
maritime
activity
or,
i.e.,
commerce.
now,
the
kelly
v.
smith
case
is
one
that
definitely
gave
us
problems
in
the
fifth
circuit.
judge
thornberry
in
our
argument
there
indicated
that
the
panel
decided
our
decision
would
probably
not
decide
kelly
v.
smith
the
way
it
was.
but
you
will
recall
that
is
the
case
of
the
deer
poachers
who
were
fleeing
an
island
in
the
mississippi
river.
certainly,
the
court
had
a
good
deal
of
fun
in
writing
that
case.
one
of
the
things
that
is
important,
too,
and
ought
not
to
be
overlooked
in
kelly
is
that
there
was
simply
no
other
cause
of
action.
all
of
the
state
proceedings
had
prescribed,
or
the
statute
had
run,
in
common-law
lingo.
but
in
kelly,
the
remedy,
if
there
was
to
be
a
remedy,
was
to
be
admiralty.
i
view
that
kelly
v.
smith
is
more
of
an
extreme
example
of
the
lack
of
a
maritime
flavor
to
the
activity.
but
look
at
the
location.
we're
talking
about
the
mississippi
river,
and
a
very
definite
hazard
can
be
posed
to
commercial
navigation
because
of
the
activity
complained
of.
we've
got
the
kelly
court
recognizing
that
the
pilot
of
the
small
boat
is
the
pilot
that
is
wounded
by
the
shot
from
shore,
and
we
have
got
activity
in
the
mississippi
river.
that
is
why
i
think
that
kelly
ought
to
be
the
far
parameter--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--i
would.
that
is--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--no,
sir.
i
think
that
that
would
be
equally
wrong.
i
think--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--that
is
right.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
no.
i
would
say
that
the
location
ought
to
be
examined
in
light
of
its
importance
to
commerce,
and
that
the
activity
complained
of
ought
to
also
be
examined
in
light
of
its
relationship--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that.
if
a
pleasure
boat
collided--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--a
pleasure
boat
colliding
with
a
barge
on
this
particular
waterway
further
south,
or
whatever.
a
commercial--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--i
cannot
say
that
either,
because
that
is
the
importance
of
the
harbor.
certainly,
if
this
accident
would
have
occurred
in
the
port
of
new
york,
or
in
the
city
and
port
of
new
orleans
or
baton
rouge,
i
could
not
come
to
this
court
or
any
other
court
and
say
that
the
federal
interest,
and
the
admiralty
interest
is
not
significantly
great
enough,
and
that
this
activity
is
so
remote
from
commerce
and
legitimate
admiralty
ends
that
there
should
be
no
jurisdiction.
i
believe
i
can
say
that
where
we
are
now,
because
we
are
talking
about
a
very
insignificant
inland
waterway
that
has
no
commercial
purpose
and
if
it
is
even
found...
recognized
by
the
fifth
circuit...
if
it
has
any
significance
to
commercial
activities,
it
is
very
minor.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
within
the
intercoastal
waterway?
i
would
say
that
there
would
probably
be
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
think
that
the
test
is
this,
and
it
is
not
just
mr.
andrews
saying
it.
i
believe
that
mr.
benedict
helps
me,
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that.
but,
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
location,
and
its
relationship
to
commerce.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
now
let's
look
at
the
activity,
too.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
but
the
location
is
also
within...
well,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
we
were
talking
about
the
intercoastal
waterway
that
i
am
familiar
with
that
has
a
great
deal
of
inland
barge
traffic
and
a
great
deal
of
inland
ship
traffic.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
in
that
situation,
and
because
we
are
talking
about
close
to
shore,
i
would
say
probably
no
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
need
for
that
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
need
for
the
federal
court
to
entertain
it.
there
is
a
state
action
and
a
state
remedy
is
available,
but
that
is
not
what
i
would
turn
it
on.
it
is
just
simply
that
the
need
to
regulate,
as
historically
the
admiralty
has...
commerce
and
shipping...
is
simply
not
there.
and
it
ought
not
to
be
a
case
of...
you
are
opening
up
not
only
a
type
of
or
class
of
case
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court,
but
an
entire
field
of
law
that
ought
not
to
be
applicable
to
them.
in
louisiana
we
have
a
great
deal
of
small
commercial
fishermen,
small
trappers,
and
under
this
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
where
it
is
going
to
bother,
i
would
suggest,
people
in
louisiana,
but
elsewhere
is
that
if
two
piros
collide
on
an
inland
waterway,
that
not
only
gives
this
certainly
trivial
incident
access
to
a
federal
court,
which
may
not
be
bad,
but
it
gives
it
access
to
an
entire
field
of
law.
i
would
suggest
to
you
by
the
time
the
court
started
carving
out
exceptions
to
make
this
thing
work,
that
that's
where
the
confusion
would
turn
into.
i
don't
know
what
plaintiff
would
have
done
if
i
would
have
tried
to
limit
my
liability.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
that
is
right.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
would
say
so.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
that
is
right,
in
the
same
location.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
under
the
fifth
circuit's
kelly
v.
smith,
that
is
admiralty.
and
that
is
what
i
think
is
wrong
with
it,
your
honors,
and
that
is
why
i
believe
that
if
you
do
look
at
the
location,
and
as
it
moves
inshore,
there
is
just
not
that
need
to
have
admiralty
jurisdiction
apply,
and
that
is
why
there
ought
to
be
more
of
a
commercial
flavor.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
would
say
that
is.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
would
agree
with
the
trial
judge--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--it
is
confusing.
the
fifth
circuit
suggested
that
one
of
the
reasons
they
would
not
apply
the
rule
is
that
it
would
be
a
difficult
test
to
administer.
look
at
the
locality
alone
rule
that
we've
got
here.
certainly,
if
there
is
a
test
difficult
to
administer,
it
is
that.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
there's
no
question
that
it--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--no,
sir.
that
is
true.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
go
on
location;
it
said
that
a
collision
between
two
vessels,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
pleasure,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
collision
is
a
traditional
maritime
activity.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
think
that
that
is
correct
because
i
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
talking
about
navigability
in
the
same
sense
that
it
has
historically...
streams
have
historically
been
considered
navigable
for
commerce
clause
purposes.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
that
is
right.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
no,
not
at
the
time.
not
according
to
the
fifth
circuit.
it
says
that
if
it
is
navigable
or
susceptible
of
being
navigable,
in
a
commercial
sense.
if
it
is
either
commercially
navigable
or
susceptible
to
commercial--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--that
is
right.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
this
particular
stream?
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
we
don't
have--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--no.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
and
we
had
one
concurring
opinion
in
part
and
a
dissent
in
part
by
judge
thornberry
who
would
have
remanded
to
determine
the
navigability,
in
fact,
of
this
particular
stream.
in
the
record,
there
is
some
evidence
from
the
coast
guard,
i
believe
the
corps
of
engineers,
as
to
the
nature
of
the
stream
at
this
particular
point.
that
issue
of
navigability,
in
fact,
was
never
tried,
nor
recognized
by
the
court.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
it
did
not
hold
that.
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
that
portion
of
the
opinion
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
believe
the
words
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
that
"we
recognize"
from
the
record
that
this
area
is
not
used
for
commerce
or
seldom,
if
ever,
used
i
believe
is
the
word
that
they
used.
so
that
the
issue
of
navigability
in
fact
has
really
never
been
adjudicated.
judge
thornberry
would
send
it
back.
we
haven't
asked
for
that
remedy
here
because
we
want
you
to
look
at
the
commercial
aspects
of
it,
as
we
did
in
the
district
court
and
as
we
did
in
the
fifth
circuit.
i
think
that
that
is
an
important
thing
to
look
at.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
think
that
we're
probably
talking
about
article
iii
jurisdiction
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
think
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
as
far
as
the...
i
don't
really
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
i
can
answer
that
intelligently
for
you
right
now.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
think
that
it
does
include
pleasure
boats.
that
extension
of
admiralty
act
is
a
legislative
enactment,
and
i
think,
too,
that
the--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--no,
it
is
not
governed
by
that
statute.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
the
fifth
circuit...
and
i
pointed
it
out
for
another
purpose,
but
i
think
that
the
case
is
applicable
here...
there
is
a
case
cited
in
my
brief
that
is
the
sohyde
drilling
company
case.
in
louisiana
and
texas,
we
are
very
familiar
with
offshore
drilling,
and
we
have
some
very
specialized
vessels
that
sometimes
are
vessels
and
sometimes
are
islands.
this
particular
vessel
was
an
island
at
the
time
of
this
injury
in
that
it
was
a
submersible
drilling
platform
that
was
drilling
on
the
bottom
of
the
lake.
the
action
was
attempted
to
be
brought
under
the
admiralty
extension
act.
the
fifth
circuit
in
that
opinion
said
that
there
ought
to
be
some
commercial
traditional
nexus
of
the
activity
and
the
complained-of
injury
in
order
to
support
admiralty
jurisdiction.
so--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--i
think
that
that
boat...
i
think
that
pleasure
boats
would
be
vessels
under
the
act.
and
if
there
was
some
damage
to
a
shore-based
plaintiff
or
to
an
extension
of
land
that
was
caused
by
a
vessel,
including
a
pleasure
craft,
in
navigation,
then
i
believe
there
would
be
supportive
jurisdiction
in
a
federal
admiralty
court
under
the
extension
of
admiralty
act.
there
are
other
legislative
expansions,
i
would
suggest,
of
the
jurisdiction;
notably,
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
limitation
of
liability
acts,
which
are
legislative
encroachments
upon
traditionally-defined
jurisprudential
jurisdictional
guidelines.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i
don't
think
that
i
can
complain
that
you've
gone
too
far
in
any
event,
so
far.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
that
is
right.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
it
does
go
rather
far,
but
it
is...
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
needed
it
was
because
at
that
time,
the
court
was
primarily
looking
at
locality
alone.
and
certainly,
we
had
some
awkward
results
when
we
were
applying
that
law,
and
the
extension
of
admiralty
act
eliminated
a
lot
of
the
injustices
that
were
just
inherent
in
the
application
of
that
act.
i
think
that
it's
time
that
we
do
look
at
a
little
something
else.
we
need
something.
one
of
the
groups
of
scholars
would
indicate
that
they
would
have
maritime
nexus
without
any
need
for
the
location
to
be
important.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
ought
to
go
that
far.
if
we
look
at
the
contract
cases
in
the
maritime
field,
we
haven't
had
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
problems
with
it
because
despite
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
contract,
we
have
been
talking
about
requiring
a
maritime
nexus
there
which
is
almost
inevitably
commercial.
and
we
simply
haven't
had
those
problems
in
the
contract,
maritime
contract
field
that
we
have
in
the
maritime
personal
injury
when
we
have
applied
the
locality
alone
test,
but
with
the
advent
of
all
this
pleasure
boating
and
pleasure
and
sport
fishing.
so
something
ought
to
be
done.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
what
i
have
proposed,
and
as
professor
benedict
points
out,
i
think
that's
a
workable
solution.
i
think,
too,
that
that
rule
would
also
help
in
the
real
puzzling
question
of
aircraft
litigation
and
aircraft
collisions
at
sea.
because
there,
too,
we
are
talking
about...
once
we
are
talking
about
international
flights,
for
example,
from
new
york
to
london
and
a
crash
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic,
we
are
talking...
and
we
start
talking
about
the
traditional
role
of
the
maritime
services
in
transporting
passengers
from
one
country
to
another.
then
there,
we
don't
need
that
much
of
a
connection
to
traditional
notions
of
maritime
activity,
so
that
you
are
not
doing
any
injustice
or
abusing
language
to
try
to
make
something
fit
in
both
categories.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
that
debate
is
much
greater
than
the
debate
here.
i
think,
in
my
view,
if
we
have
two
airplanes
colliding
in
midair
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic,
we
have
got
to
have
jurisdiction
someplace.
there
may
not
be
remedies
available
to
those
passengers.
that
type
of
activity
is
a...
that
is
transportation
is
the
type
of
activity
which
has
traditionally
been
done
by
oceanliner.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--that's
true.
but
i
would
say,
too,
that
you
have
a
closer
maritime
connection.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
i'm
saying
that
we've
got...
well,
let
me--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--can
i
cite
my
example
to...
because
i
didn't
want
to
get
both
of
them
off
of
the
ground.
i
wanted
them
to
crash
in
the
ocean.
my
example
and
the
rule--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--that
is
right.
but
i
think
that
we
have...
the
rule
that
benedict
would
put
forth
to
look
at
the
commercial
location
and
commercial
activity
and
weigh
that
to
determine
admiralty
jurisdiction
would
also
work
in
the
other
field
of...
closely-related
field
of
cases,
or
line
of
cases;
notably,
executive
jet--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
no.
i
think
that
you
would
get
that
out
of--
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
--yes.
my
test.
and
whether
or
not
that's...
well,
the
courts
are
so
inclined
to
get
it
out,
too.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
reserve
any
other
time
for
rebuttal,
but
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
arthur
h.
andrews
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
rebuttal;
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
because
it
is
not
in
my
brief,
but
the
record
will
support
my
statement
that
after
this
collision,
one
of
the
passengers
on
my
vessel
waded
over
to
plaintiff
and
pulled
him
ashore,
so
we're
talking
about
water
that
is
less
than
waist
deep
in
this
location.
