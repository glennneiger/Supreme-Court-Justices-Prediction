mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
respondents'
position
herein,
your
honors,
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
is
correct
in
encompassing
and
saying
that
the
factual
situation
herein
is
encompassed
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
admiralty
law
has
traditionally,
i
would
suggest,
been
concerned
with
navigation,
navigation
rules
and
collisions
which
occur
on
navigable
waterways.
the
case
of
executive
jet,
this
court's
case,
aviation
v.
city
of
ohio,
tells
us
that,
and
justice
stewart,
writing
the
majority
says
that
the
law
of
admiralty
deals
with
navigation
rules.
the
rules
that
govern
the
manner
and
direction
vessels
move
upon
navigable
water,
and
he
further
states
that
when
a
collision
occurs,
the
litigants
will
look
to
the
law
of
admiralty
with
its
peculiar
expertise
in
this
field
to
determine
the
nature
of
damages
and
fault
and
liability.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
this
is
the
supreme
court
case,
executive
jet
aviation
v.
city
of
ohio,
your
honor.
the
same
premise,
of
course,
is
recognized
in
lower
court
opinions.
the
st.
hilaire
moye
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
v.
henderson,
eight
circuit
case,
together
with
kelly
v.
smith
of
the
fifth
circuit,
both
recognize
that
admiralty
law
has
traditionally
furnished
remedies
for
those
injured
while
traveling
navigable
waters.
then
we
have
the
problem
with
the
three
prior
executive
jet
supreme
court
cases
of
levinson
v.
deupree,
coryell
v.
phipps
and
just
v.
chambers,
which
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
the
traditional
remedies
that
this
court
has
furnished
for
those
who
are
injured
while
traversing
navigable
waters
is
not
merely
lost
because
pleasure
boats
were
involved.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
your
honor,
i
would
use
the
definition,
of
course,
that
comes
from
the
daniel
ball
case,
that
first
it
has
to
be
navigable,
in
fact,
and
that
it
is
navigable
in
fact
when
it
is
susceptible
of
commerce
in
its
ordinary
state,
and
it
is
susceptible
of
commerce
when
it
by
itself
or
along
with
other
streams,
forms
a
continuous
highway
over
which
commerce
can
be
adapted.
and
the
amite
river
here,
i
would
submit,
meets
that
definition,
because
the
amite
river,
of
course,
from
the
evidence
and
so
forth,
is
navigable
in
fact.
the
corps
of
engineer
report,
the
department
of
the
army
report
as
to
depth--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--well,
it
permits
commerce
at
the
point
of
this
collision,
certainly,
and--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--no,
your
honor,
no,
sir,
but
in
the
middle
of--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--not
close
to
the
shore.
i
am
sure
that
the
depth
would
taper
off
toward
the
shore,
but--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--oh,
yes,
sir,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
navigable,
in
fact,
because
it
has
a
depth
that--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--your
example
about
the
crawfish
fishermen?
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
some
of
them,
yes,
sir,
would
meet
the
daniel
ball
navigation--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--well,
if
the
crawfish
in
your
example
are
sold
to
an
outlet,
a
seafood
outlet,
which
most
of
these
people
make
a
living
that
way,
then
commerce
is
involved
and
under
my
definition--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--no,
sir,
if
that's
all
they
were
making,
but
some
of
those
people
crawfishing
making
quite
a
good
living,
you
know,
forty
or
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
well,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
correct
because
in
your
example,
that
particular
fisherman's
vessel
has
been
so
defined--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--he
is
a
pleasure
fisherman,
or
a
person
engaged
in
pleasure
fishing
for
his
own
good--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--i
would
submit
that
he
is
still
in
a
waterbound
vessel,
and
he
still
has
to
face
the
same
hazards
in
that
little
piro,
in
that
little
pleasure
boat--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--it
would
depend,
of
course,
upon
the
depth
of
the
river
at
the
time.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
well,
i
would
submit
that
if
it
is
susceptible
to
supporting
commerce,
whether
it
be
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
or
on
the
end
of
the
stream
and
so
forth,
yes,
under
the
supreme
court
case,
daniel
ball,
it
is
navigable
because...
this
amite
river,
you
must
understand,
it
flows,
it
bottoms
out
into
lake
maurepas,
which
also
connects
to
the
pontchartrain,
and
from
the
pontchartrain,
this
river
can
give
access
to
commerce,
not
only
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
but
with
other
states
within
the
united
states
and
also,
international
trade.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
record...
i
think
it's
the
corps
of
engineers
report.
no,
it's
the
department
of
army
report
which
is
in
the
record
at
pages
103
to
119,
shows
the
depth
of
the
amite
river
near
the
point
of
collision
to
be
eight
feet,
within
a
range
permissible
for
commercial
vessel
use.
now,
i
don't
know
if
they
measured...
i'm
sure
that
would
be
the
deepest
point.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
would
submit
that
within
the
definition
that
we
have
of
navigability,
the
amite
river
meets
that
definition
here,
at
the
point
of
the
collision
and
further
on
down.
i
think
it
is
susceptible
of
commerce,
and
indeed,
we
have
documentation
in
the
record
that
shows
that
it
might,
in
fact,
be
engaged
in
commerce
because
there
are
certain
bridge
openings
along
the
river,
and
it's
part
of
the
record,
too,
it's
the
department
of
transportation
report
and
record
136
through
139
reveals
that
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
there
were
numerous
openings
of
bridges
for
vessels
along
the
amite
river.
now,
it
could
be
a
large
pleasure
boat
or
it
could
have
been
a
commercial
boat
of
some
sort,
but
that
bridge
was
open
to
permit
traffic.
and
it's
not
the
type
of
situation
that
we
have
in
adams
v.
montana
where
you
have
a
stream
which
is
dammed
on
both
ends--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
sometimes
you
would
open
it,
and
i
believe
the
record
will
reflect,
sometimes
the
bridges
will
open
merely
for
maintenance
purposes.
but
they
are
differentiated
in
that
record,
and
sometimes
they
were
open
for
vessels
or
whatever
nature.
but
the
fifth
circuit
i
believe
had
to
conclude
that
this
river
certainly
was
navigable
under
the
definition
of
these
courts
in
order
to
find
admiralty
jurisdiction.
and
i--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--yes,
sir,
that
is
how
i
understand
his
dissent
in
that
case.
your
honor,
it
would
be
submitted
that
the
proper
focus
should
not
be
on
profit
or
commerce,
but
the
proper
focus
should
be
to
equate
traditional
maritime
activities
with
waterbound
vessels.
and
if
you
adopted
a
test
in
that
order,
we
would
see
that
we
would
be
working
with
a
simple
test.
it
would
be
almost
as
simple
as
locality.
if
there
is
a
waterbound
vessel
involved,
then
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
because
these
pleasure
boats
can
cause
as
much
problems
to
commerce
and
to
the
freedom
of
navigation
on
these
navigable
streams
if
they
collide
as
two
commercial
vessels.
we
recognize
that
commercial
vessels
and
fishing
vessels
come
in
all
sizes,...
i
mean
pleasure
vessels
come
in
all
sizes,
and
a
pleasure
boat
is
not
relegated
like
your
large
pleasure
lots
and
so
forth,
to
interstate
waters,
but
can
traverse
international
waters.
the
test
is
irrational,
in
my
opinion,
if
you
place
it
on
profit
or
commerce.
now,
if
we
adopted,
or
if
you
adopted
the
test
which
would
equate
the
traditional
maritime
nexus
with
waterbound
vessels,
i
think
you
would
be
excluding
those
cases
that
this
court
has
expressed
it
did
not
want
to
decide
under
admiralty
law;
those
cases
involving
aviation,
those
cases
involving
the
individual
who
is
injured
on
the
surfboard.
that
is
not
a
waterbound
vessel.
swimmers
colliding
with
a
submerged
object,
which
has
been
held
admiralty
law,
and
the
peytavin
case
which
was
a
fifth
circuit
case,
where
the
automobile
was
rear-ended
on
one
of
these
floating
pontoons
as
it
was
getting
ready
to
board
a
ferry.
that
would
not...
if
you
do
that,
if
you
adopt
this
case,
you
would
be
excluding
those
unwanted
cases,
but
yet,
you
would
be
avoiding
the
observed
distinctions
between
injured
passengers
and
non-passengers,
between
profit
and
non-profit,
and
this
test
would
protect
the
uniformity,
the
federal
interest,
i
would
suggest,
in
uniformity
because
all
these
federal
rules
of
the
road
are
made
applicable
to
all
boats.
vessel
is
defined
to
include--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
they
certainly
were.
in
fact,--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--i
think
the
federal
rules
of
the
road
would
determine
the
standard
of
care
in
that
particular
incident.
and
i'm
worried
about
the
situation--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--yes,
sir.
well,
part
of
the
federal
law.
the
federal
rules
of
the
road
would
apply,
but
necessarily
the
remedies
and
the
liability
determinations
that
comes
from
admiralty
law,
so
to
speak.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
i'm
worried
about
what
would
happen,
your
honor,
if
we
allow
the
states
to
regulate
in
these
areas,
because
we
tie
the
test
of
profit
or
commerce--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--i
think
so.
if
he's
not
in
a
waterbound
vessel,
i
think
the
state
should
regulate
it.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
yes,
sir,
it's
not
like
the
factual
situation
here--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--if
it's
not
like
the
factual
situation
here--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
i
think
you
should,
and
i
think
you
should
draw
the
line
either
on
the
test
submitted
by
the
court
in
kelly
v.
smith
and
adopt
it
in
this
case
where
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
involved.
you
look
at
the
instrumentalities
involved;
you
look
at
the
role
of
the
parties,
you
look
at
the
causation
and
you
look
at
traditional
concepts
of
maritime
law.
and
if
you
look
at
those
in
connection
with
this
case,
you
find
out
that
both
individuals
were
pilots
of
vessels
on
navigable
water.
they
are
subjected
to
the
same
rules
as
the
big
boats
and
so
forth.
they
are
subjected
to
the
same
hazards
of
navigation.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
i
don't
know
what
would
be
susceptible
of
commerce,
but
if
there
is
a
determination
that
it
is
not
susceptible
of
commerce
in
its
present
state,
then
admiralty
law
should
not
get
into
that
situation,
because
the
federal
interest
is
not
there,
in
protecting
the
uniformity
for
commercial
vessels
and
so
forth.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
i
would
hate
to
pin
the
test
on
commerce,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--i
believe
the
fifth
circuit
said
if
it's
navigable,
if
it's
susceptible
of
commerce,
which
they
concluded
this
river
was
susceptible
of
commerce.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor,
interpreted
it
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
i
would
say
the
test
should
be
drawn
either
like
st.
hilaire
moye
on
waterbound
vessels
alone.
if
they're
involved,
there's
admiralty
law,
if
they're
on
a
navigable
stream.
or
i
suggest
that
you
apply
the
kelly
v.
smith
test,
which
looks
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
even
looking
at
kelly
v.
smith,--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--admiralty
law.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
not
a
waterbound
vessel,
that's
correct.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
that
gets
a
little
bit...
if
the
waterskier
is
being
pulled
by
a
waterbound
vessel,
then
i
think
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
navigability.
certainly,
if
the
boat
that
the
waterskier
has
been
pulled
by
collides
with
another
vessel,
pleasure
or
otherwise,
yes,
there
would
be
admiralty
law.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
yes,
the
waterbound
vessel
is
involved
and
i
would
say
that
under
this
test,
you
would
have
admiralty
law.
it's
a
hazard
of
navigability.
the
commercial
vessels
runs
that
same
risk,
too.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
if
the
boat
was
engaged
in
navigation,
i
would
say
yes,
it
certainly
could
be
heard
in
admiralty
law.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
there's
very
little
justification
in
your
particular
case.
there's
more
justification
in
the
case
that
we
are
litigating
today,
because
it
involves
the
federal
interest
in
protecting
the
freedom
of
navigation
for
all
vessels,
and
the
federal
interest
has
been
reiterated
and
shown
to
us
by
the
statutes.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
i
think
the
automobile
situation
might
be
distinguished
in
that
admiralty
law
has
developed
its
own
particular
type
of
law
and
its
own
particular
type
of
defenses
and
so
forth.
and
in
louisiana
if
a
commercial
automobile
or
commercial
truck
is
involved
in
an
accident,
the
same
type
of
law
would
apply.
in
louisiana,
the
law
of
negligence
would
apply
to
that.
but
if
a
commercial
vessel
was
involved
in
admiralty,
then
admiralty's
particular
type
law
would
apply,
which
is
different
than
louisiana.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that
same
analogy
between
highway--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--i
would
argue
that
if
they
are
to
be
deprived
of
jurisdiction,
it
is
because
of
the
federal
interest
in
this
area
in
protecting
navigation.
a
collision
between
those
two
private
vessels
presents
a
hazard
to
another
commercial
vessel
or
commerce
on
that
river,
and
that's
where
the
federal
interest
comes
in
because
admiralty
law
recognizes
that.
that's
why
i
would
say
the
difference
is
there.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
it's
federal
jurisdiction,
i
would
say.
but
i
am
saying
that
if
we're
going
to
define
traditional
maritime
nexus...
and
i
agree
that
there
should
be
some
definition
of
that
and
there
should
be
more
than
locality...
to
limit
the
type
of
cases
that
come
before
this
court
and
so
forth,
i'm
saying
that
the
proper
test
should
not
be
on
commerce
or
profit,
because
it
produces
irrational
results.
we
might
not
be
able
to
determine
if
there's
a
fishing
boat
right
down
here
and
this
man
over
here
is
engaged
in
selling
his
fish
in
a
very
small
vessel,
but
he's
engaged
in
selling
his
fish
for
a
living
to
a
seafood
outlet,
well,
to
this
fellow
down
here,
he
appears
to
be
pleasure.
he
doesn't
have
the
words
"commerce"
written
across
his
vessel.
so
then
the
state
law
might
control.
but
later
on,
we
find
out
he
was
selling
those
fish--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--could
he
get
maintenance
and
care?
no,
sir,
he'd
have
to
be
a
seaman
for
that,
and
i
don't
think
he
would
be
a
seaman.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
because
he's
not--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--i
don't
think
it
would--
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,
iii
--no.

yes,
sir,
i
think
maritime
law
is
broader
than
that.
i
think
maritime
law
should
include
collisions

pleasure

--for
this
particular
case,
yes,
your
honor,
but
my
personal
feelings
are
that
admiralty
law
should
encompass
any
waterbound
vessel
on
navigable
water.
mr.
dorsey
c.
martin,

no,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.

shouldn't.

your

it

submitted
under
either
of
the
tests
that
have
developed
in
the
circuit

attempting
to
define
what
this
court
meant
by
traditional
wrong
bearing
a
significant
relationship
to
traditional
maritime
activities.

v.

of
the
eight
circuit
saying
that
the
traditional
maritime
nexus
is
met
when
a
waterbound
vessel
is
involved,
or
the
test

v.

of

the
facts
of

support

jurisdiction.
all
vessels
applying
on
navigable
waters,
regardless
of
their
size
or
commercial
status,
face
these
unique
hazards
of
the
waters
which
maritime
law,
due

its
continued
experience,
is
peculiarly
suited
to
handle.
it
is
submitted,
your
honor,
that
because
the
fifth
circuit
case
in
this
matter
recognizes
the
traditional
concept
of
admiralty
law
in
regard
to
the
factual
situation
of
this
case,
that
fifth
circuit
case
promotes
the
federal
interest
in
keeping
our
navigable
waters
free
from
maritime
uses,
and
also
promotes
uniformity
of
commerce

makes
jurisdiction
readily
ascertainable
before
a
collision,
not
after
a
collision,
and
a
determination
by
the
courts
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
commercial
interest
involved;
i.e.,
federal
rules
of
admiralty,
or
whether
it
is
purely
pleasurable,
invoking
state
rules.
and
because
the
fifth
circuit
case
provides
a
rational,
simple
test
that
is
not
all-inclusive
that
would
accomplish
what
this
court
would
like
to
do
in
eliminating
certain
cases
which
do
not
have
a
nexus
to
admiralty
law
from
being
heard
in
admiralty,
that
it
should
be
upheld.
