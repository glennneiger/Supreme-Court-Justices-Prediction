justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clarke,
do
you
think
that
congress
acting
under
its
commerce
power
can
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts
which
the
--
a
state
is
specifically
prohibited
from
doing
by
the
--
by
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
read
the
fifth
amendment
to
provide
that
in
the
event
that
the
taking
is
for
private
use
rather
than
public
use
no
compensation
need
be
provided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
your
submission
as
to
where
that
should
be
determined?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
the
court
of
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
stillman,
a
moment
ago
you
used
the
term
“federally
guaranteed
loans.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
mean
that
if
the
original
obligor
defaults
and
the
federal
government
has
to
come
in
and
make
good
on
its
guarantee,
the
government
has
recourse
against
the
original
obligor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
stillman,
supposing
the
rock
island
had
been
a
going
concern,
do
you
think
congress
could
have
singled
it
out
and
said
to
its
management,
every
employee
on
the
rock
island
shall
receive
hourly
wage
of
$5
an
hour
or
more?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
--
that's
not
the
same
as
the
taking
for
public
use.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
act
didn't
reactivate
the
operations
of
the
rock
island.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
distinguish
the
dayton-goose
creek
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
icc
said
it
was
forbidden.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
saying
it's
forbidden.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
icc
has
never
said
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
--
a
new
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
--
that's
true
of
all
investors
in
any
corporation
prior
to
1938
in
the
passage
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
isn't
it?
they
--
they
made
their
investment
with
the
understanding
that
the
company
could
pay
its
help
as
little
as
it
could
get
by
with.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
in
1970,
say
prior
to
the
milwaukee
liquidation,
prior
to
the
rock
island
liquidation,
had
said
affirmatively
there
will
be
labor
benefit
programs
for
all
railroads
that
subsequently
go
into
liquidation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lawyers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what
is
the
estate
valued
at?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
certainly
is
a
liquidation
value
on
the
remaining
assets.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
we
can't
find
any
value
in
them,
i
guess.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
really
saying
if
the
$75
million
is
imposed,
if
it
is
going
to
be
paid
in
total,
it
necessarily
will
be
a
priority
administrative
expense
and
will
dilute
to
the
other
claims
to
administrative
expenses.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
murray,
how
realistic
is
the
$7500
figure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
priority
between
the
administrative
expenses
and
the
first
mortgage
bond
holders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
lot
of
them
are
not
to
the
extent
that
(voice
overlap)
these
mortgage
bond
holders
have
profited
by
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he'd
have
to
do
so
if
the
fund
were
large
enough
to
cover
both.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
--
was
the
milwaukee
reorganized
out
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
actually
a
section
77
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
section
77
is
passed
pursuant
to
the
bankruptcy
power.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
plan
of
liquidation
in
the
section
77
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
question
is
what
claims
are
you
going
to
pay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
grows
out
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
involving
the
rock
island
railroad
which
had
been
pending
before
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
since
1975.
after
a
labor
strike
in
1979
rendered
the
railroad
unable
to
pay
its
operating
expenses,
the
district
court
concluded
that
reorganization
was
impossible
and
directed
the
rock
island
trustee
to
liquidate
the
estate's
assets.
in
june
1980,
the
district
court
ordered
the
abandonment
of
the
rock
island
system
and
disallowed
any
claim
of
--
or
arrangement
for
labor
protection
payments
payable
out
of
the
estates
assets.
three
days
before
the
district
court's
order,
however,
the
president
signed
into
law
the
rock
island
railroad
transition
and
employee
assistance
act
called
rita.
under
rita,
the
trustee
must
pay
benefits
of
up
to
$75
million
to
rock
island
employees
who
were
not
hired
by
other
carriers.
the
estate's
employee
obligations
under
rita
must
be
considered
to
be
administrative
expenses
of
the
estate
for
purposes
of
establishing
the
priority
of
the
employee's
claims
to
the
estate's
assets.
the
appellees,
who
are
the
trustees
and
others,
filed
a
complaint
with
the
district
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
rita.
the
district
court
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
rita's
employee
protection
provisions
holding
that
a
constituted
uncompensated
taking
of
private
property
for
public
purpose
in
violation
of
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
congress
responded
to
this
injunction
by
an
enacting
section
701
of
the
staggers
rail
act
of
1980,
which
reenacted
the
employee
protection
provisions
of
rita
in
amended
form.
the
district
court
likewise
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
determine
whether
the
amended
rita
violates
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
we
find
that
the
employee
protection
provisions
are
repugnant
to
article
i,
section
8,
clause
4
of
the
constitution
which
empowers
congress
to
enact
uniform
laws
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcy
throughout
the
united
states.
although
the
uniformity
requirement
is
not
a
straightjacket
that
forbids
congress
from
distinguishing
among
classes
of
creditors
nor
from
treating
railroad
bankruptcies
as
a
distinctive
problem
it
nonetheless
has
force
of
its
own.
it
does
not
deny
congress
power
to
fashion
legislation
directed
at
geographically
isolated
problem.
by
its
terms
however,
rita
applies
to
only
one
regional
bankrupt
railroad,
only
rock
island's
creditors
are
affected
by
rita's
employee
protection
provision
and
only
rock
island
employees
may
benefit
from
this
arrangement.
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
it
seems
to
us
that
rita
is
not
a
response
either
to
the
particular
problems
of
major
railroad
bankruptcies
or
to
any
other
geographically
isolated
problem.
it
is
a
response
to
the
problems
caused
by
the
bankruptcy
of
the
one
regional
railroad
which
it
applies.
since
the
law
cannot
be
said
to
apply
uniformly
to
all
creditors
and
all
debtors
it
therefore
violates
the
previously
mentioned
constitutional
provision.
justice
marshall
joined
by
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
