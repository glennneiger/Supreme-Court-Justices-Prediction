mr.
daniel
r.
murray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
principal
issue
presented
in
this
appeal
is
whether
by
special
legislation
congress
can
impose
upon
a
bankrupt
railroad
already
in
liquidation
a
new
obligation
solely
for
the
benefit
of
its
former
employees
who
are
no
longer
going
to
be
working
in
the
railroad
industry,
an
obligation
that
will
displace
the
interest
of
the
creditors
and
the
shareholders
of
that
railroad.
this
proceeding
depends
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
this
act
has
two
purposes
-
first,
the
pubic
interest
and
the
continued
rail
service,
and
secondly
and
an
equally
important
purpose,
the
conservation
of
the
estate
in
the
interest
of
the
creditors
and
the
shareholders.
now,
with
the
outset
of
these
proceedings,
so
when
they
were
filed
in
march
17,
1975,
judge
mcgarr
ordered
the
trustee
to
continue
operations
of
the
rock
island.
and
at
that
time
he
had
to
make
a
--
a
determination
that
the
railroad
was
reorganizable
and
that
the
security
of
the
creditors
would
not
be
impaired.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
judge
mcgarr
had
thought
at
that
time
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
labor
protection
being
imposed
in
the
amounts
that
the
rlea
and
the
government
contend
was
possible,
he
never
would
have
permitted
reorganization
to
go
on
at
that
time.
he
would
have
stopped
it
right
then
and
there
because
the
thought
of
imposing
six
years
of
wages,
giving
that
to
employees
in
the
event
of
liquidation
would
mean
that
there
would
be
no
way
that
--
that
the
security
of
the
creditors
could
be
protected
if
reorganization
proceedings
would
be
ongoing.
and
i
submit
that
that
would
be
true
in
almost
every
railroad
reorganization
proceeding,
that
the
proceeding
would
have
to
stop
right
there
if
the
liability
of
that
magnitude
could
be
imposed
upon
the
estate
of
a
railroad.
now,
in
pursuit
of
these
public
interest
objectives
of
section
77
however,
the
reorganization
court
permitted
the
--
the
ongoing
rail
operations.
and
for
five
years,
the
trustee
of
the
rock
island
paid
out
$1
billion
in
wages
and
benefits
to
the
rock
island
employees
while
the
estate
eroded
in
an
amount
in
excess
of
$210
million.
and
in
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question
about
the
continuation
of
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act
and
the
railroad
retirement
fund,
i
should
point
out
that
during
this
time
of
reorganization,
the
rock
island
trustee
contributed
over
$14
million
to
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
fund
and
in
excess
of
a
$100
million
to
the
railroad
retirement
fund
just
as
the
rock
island
had
done
in
years
prior
to
reorganization.
of
course,
we
have
no
question
about
the
propriety
of
those
contributions.
as
the
reorganization
entered
its
fifth
year,
three
key
events
occurred
and
they
had
been
alluded
to
thus
far
in
the
argument.
the
first
occurred
in
the
summer
of
1979
when
the
employees
of
the
rock
island
struck
the
rock
island
and
as
a
result,
it
ceased
rail
operations
and
on
september
26,
1979,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
declared
the
rock
island
trustee
cashless.
and
from
that
point
forward
the
trustee
himself
was
not
able
to
conduct
any
rail
operations.
the
second
key
event
was
on
january
25,
1980
when
the
reorganization
court
found
that
there
no
longer
was
any
possibility
of
a
successful
reorganization
of
the
rock
island
and
he
ordered
the
trustee
to
commence
liquidation.
and
really,
from
that
point
forward
the
rock
island's
fate
was
sealed.from
that
point
forward
it
was
clear
that
the
rock
island
was
withdrawing
from
the
public
interest
service.
then
on
june
2
of
1980,
the
reorganization
court
formally
confirmed
the
total
abandonment
of
all
of
its
lines
and
at
that
time,
declined
to
condition
abandonment
on
the
payment
of
any
form
of
the
so-called
traditional
labor
protection,
and
that
order
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
was
just
on
the
eve
of
that
particular
order
that
congress
enacted
and
president
carter
signed
into
law
the
rock
island
transition
and
employee
assistance
act
which
its
new
labor
protection
obligation
of
$75
million.
and
that
act
in
essence
would
--
would
impose
a
payment
of
80%
of
a
former
employee's
salary
for
up
to
three
years
or
a
lump
sum
payment
of
each
--
to
each
employee
of
$25,000
depending
upon
seniority.
the
congress
stated
the
purpose
of
that
act
to
be
a
public
purpose,
to
continue
rail
service
in
the
midwest,
but
as
judge
mcgarr
found,
there
was
no
connection
between
the
payment
of
a
lump
sum
severance
pay
to
a
former
employee
who
is
no
longer
going
to
continue
in
any
rail
service,
there
was
no
connection
between
that
and
ongoing
rail
operations
in
the
midwest.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
they
did
not
reactivate
the
operation
by
the
trustee.
there
was
some
directed
service
that
was
ongoing
imposed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
that's
a
subject
of
separate
litigation
but
--
but
as
of
september
when
the
strike
occurred,
september
of
1979,
the
rock
island
trustee
no
longer
operated
any
railroad.
that
was
the
point
at
which
the
rock
island
stopped
all
rail
operations.
we
questioned
the
public
purpose
of
this
act
because
in
our
view,
it
is
not
being
paid
to
employees
who
are
continuing
in
rail
service.
it
is
being
paid
to
employees
who
are
no
longer
in
the
railroad
industry,
who
have
not
been
employed
by
railroads
who
are
continuing
operations
of
the
railroads.
so,
there
is
no
relationship.
this
case
is
quite
unlike
the
louden
case,
for
example,
in
which
the
rlea
relies
upon
where
there
was
an
ongoing
rail
service
by
the
rock
island
in
one
of
its
earlier
reorganizations
and
there
was
a
rationale
in
that
case
to
pay
labor
severance
pay
because
it
was
a
--
that
case
involved
a
partial
merger
or
consolidation.
the
railroad
was
ongoing,
it
was
obtaining
net
income
that
was
generated
by
the
savings
that
were
affected
by
the
consolidation
of
rail
service
and
in
that
case,
“those
savings,”
the
court
said,
“could
be
forced
to
be
apportioned
between
the
employees
who
were
displaced.”
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
in
the
event
of
a
total
liquidation?
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
in
the
event
of
a
total
liquidation,
we
would
say
it
could
not
and
that
is
the
position
that
the
seventh
circuit
took
in
connection
with
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
we
believe
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
in
the
event
of
a
total
abandonment
by
a
railroad,
that
was
in
liquidation.
now,
i
draw
that
--
that
particular
qualification
because
there
are
cases
where
a
railroad
that
is
not
in
liquidation
might
decide
to
withdraw
from
rail
service
and
it
might
be
a
perfectly
healthy
enterprise
and
there
might
be
a
situation
in
which
labor
protection
could
be
imposed,
but
that's
not
our
case.
our
case
is
one
where
this
railroad
has
totally
consumed
itself
in
the
public
interest
and
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
well,
i
submit
that
in
this
case
they
did
not
have
any
discretion
on
the
context
of
a
railroad
in
liquidation.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
well,
i
think
that's
an
--
that's
an
important
question
in
this
case
and
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
has
already
indicated
its
position
on
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
i
understand
that,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
well,
that
was
a
case
where
a
railroad
that
was
ongoing
was
required
to
share
its
excess
profits
with
other
railroads
and
i
think
it's
understood
that
all
railroads
operate
in
a
kind
of
a
community
of
interest.
they
--
they
operate
their
interlined
payments
that
are
--
are
generated.
there
are
all
kinds
of
--
there's
a
common
carrier
--
there's
a
common
fleet
of
cars.
it's
important
to
one
ongoing
railroad
that
all
the
other
ongoing
railroads
are
healthy,
but
that's
not
the
situation
of
the
rock
island.
the
rock
island
is
withdrawing
from
the
railroad
business.
it's
with
the
--
the
--
under
the
brooks-scanlon
case,
the
creditors
and
the
shareholders
of
the
rock
island
cannot
be
compelled
to
continue
their
investment
in
a
railroad
for
an
indefinite
period
--
period
with
continuing
law
suits.
there
has
to
come
an
end
at
some
point
to
that
and
that
is
what
judge
mcgarr
held
happened
on
january
25,
1980.
so
the
rock
island
is
withdrawing
from
that
group
of
common
carriers
that
have
a
common
enterprise
together
and
i
think
that
is
the
distinction
of
that
dayton
case.
the
seventh
circuit's
reasoning
has
been
--
has
been
followed
by
the
court
in
the
third
circuit
in
the
susquehanna
case
and
by
the
special
court
in
the
evaluation
proceedings
case
in
a
decision
just
handed
down
on
november
24,
1981
in
which
the
court
stated
that,
“we
would
have
considerable
doubt
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
interstate
commerce
commission
in
position
of
labor
protection
conditions
and
the
abandonment
of
a
hopelessly
losing
railroad.”
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
absolutely,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
we
would
be
in
the
position,
for
example,
of
the
milwaukee
road
which
is
an
ongoing
rail
operation
and
it
is
in
the
process
of
contracting
and
it
does
have
a
labor
protection
obligation
under
the
traditional
form
of
labor
protection
and
the
milwaukee
railroad
restructuring
act
does
benefit
it
because
it
takes
what
would
be
a
larger
obligation
and
scales
it
down.
but
the
commissions
are
always
drawn
as
a
distinction
between
a
total
abandonment
and
a
partial
abandonment.
in
a
partial
abandonment
situation,
the
railroad
has
an
interest
in
cutting
back,
scaling
back
that
obligation.
there
is
a
savings
that
is
generated
that
creates
a
net
--
a
greater
net
income
that
the
icc
has
said
should
be
shared
with
the
employees
who
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
that
loss.
in
a
total
abandonment
situation,
it's
a
loss
situation.
there
is
no
net
income
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
i
think
that
is
the
exception
i
posed
earlier
that
there
might
be
a
situation
where
a
perfectly
healthy
railroad
for
whatever
reason
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
--
is
withdrawn.
i
think
that's
a
different
case
and
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
a
labor
protection
obligation
could
be
imposed
in
that
case.
brooks-scanlon
--
and
as
brooks-scanlon
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
--
say
so
that
it
would
not
be
operating
it.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that's
not
the
brooks-scanlon
case.
this
is
a
situation
in
which
this
railroad
has
--
had
massive
losses
over
the
last
five
years
and
is
simply
in
the
--
in
the
process
of
withdrawing
and
--
and
trying
to
provide
for
a
liquidation,
a
complete
liquidation.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
say
that
under
the
--
i
have
already
indicated
in
the
case
of
the
rock
island.
the
rock
island
was
paying
even
though
it
was
losing
money
over
the
course
of
the
reorganization.
it
was
making
contributions
to
the
railroad
retirement
fund
and
to
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
fund
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
an
instance
in
which
there
is
legitimate
investment
backed
expectation
which
is
one
of
the
tests
under
the
new
york
central
cases.
that
--
that
is
a
legitimate
investment
backed
expectation
that
an
ongoing
business
even
if
it
suffers
a
loss
has
to
make
some
contributions,
for
example,
to
health
insurance
or
to
unemployment
insurance.
what's
so
unusual
about
this
case
is
that
it
was
a
retroactive
obligation
that
it
was
imposed
in
one
lump
sum
and
was
utterly
unprecedented.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
--
that
would
--
that
would
be
a
problem,
i
think.
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
yes.
right,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
the
government
has
argued
that
the
rock
island
has
benefited
from
the
labor
stability
that
was
created
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
the
rock
island
and
we
think
this
is
belied
by
the
record
in
the
first
place.
there
was
a
strike
by
the
employees
of
the
rock
island.
it
was
the
approximate
cause
of
its
collapse.but
in
any
event,
we
have
to
suggest
that
the
rock
island
had
suffered
massive
losses
over
the
five
years
of
operation
and
how
it
can
be
suggested
that
the
rock
island
benefited
in
this
particular
situation
is
quite
distinct
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
this
morning,
i
alluded
to
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
finding
that
there
was
no
labor
protection
in
the
rock
island
abandonment
situation
and
i
would
like
to
explain
the
reasoning
that
the
seventh
circuit
provided
and
the
reasoning
that
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
which
was
filed
before
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
labor
protection
arose
originally
in
connection
with
mergers
and
consolidations.
and
the
theory
behind
labor
protection
was
that
to
the
extent
that
a
merger
or
consolidation
resulted
in
a
savings
for
a
particular
ongoing
railroad
and
jobs
were
lost
in
the
process,
those
savings
ought
to
be
shared
with
the
employees
who
--
who
lost
their
jobs.
subsequently,
congress
provided
that
labor
protection
should
also
be
accorded
in
an
abandonment
situation
and
in
doing
so,
congress
cross-referenced
the
statute
on
abandonment
with
the
statute
on
--
on
consolidations
and
mergers
and
said
that
the
labor
protection
that
would
be
imposed
in
an
abandonment
situation
would
be
the
same
as
that
imposed
in
a
merger
and
consolidation
situation.
this
involved
the
payment
of
the
so-called
new
york
dock
conditions
which
were
applied
in
a
partial
abandonment
situation,
the
six
years
of
labor
protection,
80%
of
an
employee's
wages.
the
icc
developed
a
consistent
practice
of
exempting
or
declining
to
impose
any
labor
protection
in
a
total
abandonment
situation
and
when
congress
re-codified
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
indicated
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
adoption
of
that
statute
that
no
change
in
the
law
developed
by
the
icc
respecting
total
abandonments
was
intended.
and
that
same
point
was
made
when
congress
transferred
authority
over
abandonments
in
bankruptcy
situations
from
the
icc
to
the
reorganization
court
and
i
should
note
this
on
the
side
that
in
the
rock
island
case,
it
is
the
reorganization
court
under
section
17
of
the
milwaukee
road
restructuring
act
that
has
authority
and
discretion
as
to
whether
to
impose
labor
protection
in
an
abandonment
situation.
but
all
the
time
that
congress
was
re-codifying
these
languages
and
amending
and
then
transferring
it,
it
always
referred
back
to
the
language
that
had
--
to
the
to
the
language
of
the
statute
that
had
been
interpreted
by
the
icc
as
not
requiring
labor
protection
in
a
total
abandonment
situation
and
that
is
what
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
the
icc
indicated
that
they
would
not
impose
it.
they
did
not
say
it
was
forbidden.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
it's
forbidden
in
the
situation
of
a
liquidation
where
the
--
under
brooks-scanlon
where
a
railroad
has
operated
in
a
loss
consistently.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
it
has
been
indicated
by
judge
mcgarr
in
his
abandonment
order
and
that's
correct.
that
is
the
one
place
it
has
been
mentioned.
the
--
the
particular
vice
of
the
rock
island
transition
act
is
that
it
attempts
to
retroactively
impose
labor
protection
in
a
situation
where
the
rock
island
has
already
been
adjudicated
entitled
to
liquidate.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
congress
is
trying
to
enact
legislation
that
will
apply
to
all
railroads
or
all
railroads
that
subsequently
enter
into
liquidation
and
to
reorganization.
it
applies
only
to
the
situation
where
only
the
situation
of
the
rock
island
after
it
has
been
adjudicated
entitled
to
liquidate.
the
vice
of
this
kind
of
retroactive
legislation
in
part
is
that
it
impacts
upon
the
creditors
and
the
shareholders
of
the
rock
island
because
they
made
their
investment
in
the
railroad
industry
on
the
understanding
that
under
this
consistent
icc
practice
that
it
developed
over
the
years,
there
would
be
no
labor
protection
imposed
in
a
total
liquidation
situation,
that
they
will
come
upon
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
it's
true
that
that
was
the
situation
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
this
is
a
--
a
substantial
obligation
that's
being
imposed
upon
this
particular
railroad
estate
that
has
already
served
the
public
interest
for
five
years
with
$210
million.
in
an
ordinary
situation,
if
a
corporation,
a
non-railroad
went
into
bankruptcy,
it
would
just
go
into
straight
liquidation.
there
would
be
no
requirement
that
it
continue
on
operation
for
five
years
with
$210
million
of
losses.
what
is
special
about
this
case
is
that
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
because
a
railroad
has
a
partial
public
service
obligation,
this
railroad
has
been
required
to
continue
operations
unlike
any
other
corporation
has
been
required
to
continue
operations
for
five
years
with
immense
losses
and
it
has
--
it
has
served
the
public
interest
totally
and
it
can
--
it
can
give
no
more
to
that
public
interest.
that
is
the
meaning
of
judge
mcgarr's
liquidation
order
of
january
25,
1980
and
that
is
the
distinction
from
any
other
non-railroad
corporation
under
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
--
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
would
clearly
be
a
more
difficult
case
for
us.
it
would
--
there
would
not
be
the
same
degree
of
retroactivity
that
exists
on
this
particular
case.
this
case
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
it
occurred
after
the
reorganization
added
this
liquidation
phase
and
the
relevance
of
that
point
is,
that
during
the
course
of
reorganization,
this
railroad
amassed
$250
million
of
expenses
of
administration.
these
are
administrative
claimants,
small
businesses,
various
grouped
companies
that
dealt
with
the
rock
island
on
the
assumption
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
anybody
that
would
be
on
the
assumption
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
priority
under
the
railroad
reorganization
statute
under
section
77
and
under
the
very
first
order
that
judge
mcgarr
entered
in
the
case.
now,
congress,
after
the
liquidation,
is
attempting
to
impose
a
claim
that
is
either
on
the
same
plain
with
or
prior
to
that
but
it
is
going
to
have
the
effect
of
displacing
or
diluting
those
administrative
claims,
people
who
relied
upon
the
provisions
of
section
77
with
respect
to
the
priority
of
expenses
of
administration
and
that
will
have
an
impact
upon
--
if
congress
can
constitutionally
impose
such
a
prior
claim
and
at
the
twelfth
hour,
you
know,
in
--
in
the
course
of
liquidation,
that
will
have
an
impact
upon
the
ability
of
the
courts
to
conduct
reorganizations
where
there
is
a
precarious
financial
situation
for
a
particular
railroad
or
any
company
for
that
matter
because
the
possibility
always
exists
but
then
--
that
congress
could
come
along,
enact
a
new
statute
and
displace
the
interest
of
the
expensive
administration
claimants.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
at
the
present
time
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
we
do
have
some
idea,
your
honor,
that
at
the
present
time,
there
are
over
--
there
are
$250
million
of
expensive
administration
claims.
there
are
70
--
between
principal
and
interest,
somewhere
around
$75
million
of
claims
of
first
mortgage
bond
holders
and
the
sales
that
have
been
made
to
date
have
been
minimal.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
at
the
present
time,
the
escrow
fund
amounts
to
approximately
$130,
$135
million
and
there
are
no
major
sales
pending.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
we
have
--
we
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
very
difficult
to
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
at
least
dilute
them
and
perhaps
displace
them
depending
upon
the
priority
that
is
accorded
by
the
reorganization
court.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
we
have
in
the
record
an
affidavit
by
the
trustee
indicating
that
assuming
3,700
eligible
employees,
this
appears
at
page
122a
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
would
be
an
immediate
pay-out
of
$46
million
and
a
total
pay-out
of
$69
million.
that
was
calculated
in
based
upon
figures
that
were
available
in
december
of
1979
assuming
3,700
eligible
employees.
subsequently,
it
appears
that
there
are
even
fewer
employees
who
had
been
employed
by
other
railroads
and
therefore,
the
number
is
expected
to
be
higher
so
it
would
appear
in
all
likelihood
that
it
would
be
the
full
$75
million.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
well,
assuming
that
it
could
not
be
--
that
this
was
not
a
--
for
a
private
purpose,
we
would
--
we
would
say
that
there
was
still
irreparable
harm
to
the
rock
island
estate
because
this
estate
is
in
the
process
of
withdrawing
from
the
rail
service
and
from
the
public
service
and
the
effect
that
we
would
have
is
to
prevent
a
partial
distribution
that
the
reorganization
court
wants
to
make
to
the
expense
of
administration
claimants.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
it's
taken
a
--
this
act
was
passed
over
a
year
ago
and
has
taken
a
year
to
litigate
this.
it
--
i
would
imagine
it
would
take
at
least
a
year
or
two
years
assuming
the
government
raises
certain
defenses
and
--
and
there's
a
question
about
the
amount.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
real
problem
here
is
with
the
cost
of
administration
claimants.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
the
problem
there
is
that
there
are
--
there
are
costs
of
administration
claimants
as
judge
mcgarr
found
who
cannot
afford
to
wait
for
their
money.
these
are
people,
businesses
who
dealt
with
the
trustee
as
they
would
deal
with
any
other
ongoing
business
assuming
they
would
be
paid
and
what
happened
in
september
of
1979
when
the
strike
occurred
and
when
the
rock
island
became
cashless
is
that
it
was
unable
to
pay
those
expenses
of
administration
that
would
be
paid
in
any
case
and
those
people
are
now
being
deferred.
judge
mcgarr
indicated
that
he
receives
letters
each
week
from
these
people
who
are
very
necessitous
including
local
governments
and
state
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
because
the
escrow
fund
is
not
large
enough
to
cover
both
the
first
mortgage
bonds
and
the
$75-million
lien
that
would
be
imposed
upon
the
estate
and
that
is
why
he
is
unable
to
proceed
and
he
has
so
indicated
to
the
various
costs
of
administration
claimants
who
come
to
his
court
on
each
status
report
date
asking
when
are
they
going
to
be
paid.
it
is
because
the
amount
of
this
lien
that
is
overhanging
the
rock
island
estate
and
will
overhang
if
it
waits
until
a
tucker
act
claim
is
prosecuted.
that
makes
it
impossible
to
make
that
partial
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
--
distribution.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
the
--
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
again
the
escrow
fund
is
not
large
enough
to
cover
both
the
first
mortgage
bond
holders
and
the
$75
million
so
that
there
would
be
nothing
left
at
that
point
or
--
or
just
a
miniscule
amount
left
for
the
expense
of
administration
claimants.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
that
has
not
been
adjudicated
by
the
reorganization
court.
it
is
a
very
complicated
question
and
i
am
sure
that
is
going
to
take
quite
a
bit
of
time
in
the
reorganization
court.
it
would
appear
in
some
aspects,
some
aspects
of
the
expense
administration
claims
are
subordinate
to
the
first
mortgage
bond
holders
but
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
again
--
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
--
that
most
of
the
first
mortgage
bonds
would
be
prior
to
the
cost
administration
claimants
but
that
is
a
question
under
section
77
and
judge
mcgarr
has
not
ruled
upon
that
and
you
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
--
would
get
different
answers
to
that
question.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct
and
the
problem
there,
of
course,
is
you
would
get
different
answers
to
that
question
from
different
counsel
for
whom
i
am
speaking
today
so
i
should
make
that
clear.
we
are
concerned,
of
course,
in
connection
with
the
tucker
act
remedy
that
it
may
not
be
available
here
because
it
is
a
taking
for
private
benefit
of
the
former
employees
of
the
rock
island
and
we
believe
does
not
relate
to
a
public
purpose.
the
government
and
the
rlea
has
tried
to
indicate
that
some
public
purpose
is
served
by
this
but
we
are
suggesting
that
the
--
the
payments
that
are
going
to
be
made
are
not
payments.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
in
that
particular
situation,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
because
the
railroad
remains
in
the
railroad
business,
i
think
it
would
be
a
harder
question.
i
mean
that
would
be
a
--
in
fact,
the
--
the
court
has
held
in
rlea
versus
icc
that
it
is
a
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there,
the
thought
is
that
it
--
that
the
rationale
there
is
the
connection
between
the
fact
that
an
ongoing
railroad
profits
from
the
partial
abandonment
that
is
affected
and
that
the
congress
can
regulate
the
sharing
of
that
profit
with
employees
who
are
displaced
because
only
a
few
employees
have
to
bear
the
burden
for
which
the
entire
railroad
profits.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
well,
i
think
they
understood
it
to
mean
that
if
the
rail
--
i
think
they
understood
brooks-scanlon
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
brooks-scanlon
like
new
haven
inclusion
per
se,
that
if
a
railroad
operates
at
a
loss
consistently
over
the
years,
they
have
a
right
to
withdraw
their
investment
from
rail
service
and
that
cannot
be
subject
to
conditions
such
as
the
congress
tried
to
attach
here.
that's
--
i
think
that's
really
the
bottom
line
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
right
that
they
assume
they
could
withdraw
their
investment
and
they
assumed
that
that
could
not
be
conditioned
by
the
imposition
of
a
large
labor
protection
claim
particularly
in
light
of
the
consistent
icc
interpretation
of
the
abandonment
statutes.
i
want
to
address
very
briefly
the
question
of
--
the
problem
of
this
law
is
a
non-uniform
law
in
bankruptcy
because
i
think
that
is
a
matter
that's
of
concern
to
us
in
this
particular
situation.
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
law
is
that
it
does
not
attempt
to
generally
amend
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
to
apply
to
all
railroads
and
it
does
not
attempt
even
to
deal
with
--
with
all
railroads
that
are
now
currently
in
section
77.
it
applies
only
to
one
railroad
which
is
the
rock
island
railroad.
and
the
difficulty
we
have
with
that
is,
of
course,
that
it
permits
congress
to
tamper
with
an
individual
bankrupt
estate
and
we
think
that
that
--
the
device
of
that
is
that
there
is
--
we
think
there
is
some
protection
that
--
that
exists
in
the
uniform
law
on
bankruptcy
clause
of
the
constitution
because
the
framers
required
that
legislation,
for
one,
must
apply
to
all
and
it
prevents
some
tampering
with
one
individual
railroad
estate.
and
that's
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is,
but
the
milwaukee
is
on
a
different
situation.
in
fact,
the
way
the
act
applied
in
the
milwaukee
railroad
case
was
quite
differently
--
quite
different
in
the
way
it
applied
to
the
rock
island
case.
the
milwaukee
was,
when
the
milwaukee
railroad
restructuring
act
was
enacted
and
it
is
now
an
ongoing
railroad.
and,
of
course,
there
was
a
partial
abandonment
labor
protection
liability
there.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here
when
our
act
was
enacted.
we
had
already
been
adjudicated
entitled
to
liquidate.
the
--
the
government
argues
that
this
is
a
law
affecting
commerce
and
therefore,
is
not
--
they
are
not
bound
by
the
uniformity
requirement
of
the
bankruptcy
power
in
the
constitution.
the
difficulty
with
this
argument,
i
think,
is
that
--
is
two-fold.
on
the
one
hand,
congress
--
almost
every
bankruptcy
law
attempts
and
it
--
it
involves
in
some
way
interstate
commerce,
i
think,
one
would
have
to
say.
and
secondly,
we
think
that
just
as
the
--
we
think
that
the
commerce
power
is
qualified
by
other
more
specific
constitutional
provisions
and
we
think
that
is
the
case
here.
this
is
a
more
specific
constitutional
provision
than
any
law
in
bankruptcy
must
in
some
sense
be
uniform
if
a
bankruptcy
act
can
--
can
apply
only
one
--
to
one
railroad
that
seems
to
us
to
suggest
that
the
uniformity
clause
really
doesn't
have
any
meaning
any
longer.
another
concern
that
this
particular
act
raises
is
the
disregard
for
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
and
--
and
that
particular
connection,
i
should
note,
that
this
particular
legislation
compels
judge
mcgarr
to
enter
an
order
without
any
exercise
of
his
own
discretion
just
immediately
preceding
a
date
on
which
he
was
scheduled
to
enter
his
decision
on
the
particular
matter.
in
a
sense,
this
--
this
particular
legislation
dictated
the
decision
only
days
before
the
decision
was
to
be
made.
it
is,
thus,
like
united
states
versus
klein.
it
is
unlike
ex
parte
mccardle
because
there
was
no
attempt
to
withdraw
jurisdiction.
they
simply
imposed
a
particular
rule
of
decision
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
i
don't
believe
they
did
that
though,
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
if
they
did
it
prospectively
for
all
railroads
and
did
it
in
connection
with
this
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
right,
the
bankruptcy
clause.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
it
wouldn't,
but
on
this
particular
circumstance,
what
they
did
was
they
tried
to
dictate
the
decision.
they
said
that
the
decision
that
the
icc
would
enter
would
be
one
that
was
fair
and
equitable.
both
--
what
they
defined
that
to
mean
whatever
happened
in
the
milwaukee
road
must
happen
here.
of
course,
the
two
are
utterly
unlike.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
we
--
we
have
cited
the
united
states
versus
klein
case.
i
would
say
that
it's
very
rare
that
congress
has
enacted
a
piece
of
legislation
in
this
circumstance.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
the
--
the
klein
case
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
--
is
only
one
precedent
in
which
we
rely
on,
your
honor.
we
are
particularly
concerned
about
the
way
this
particular
act
operates
when
you
combine
the
uniformity
point
that
it
operates
only
on
one
particular
railroad
and
the
fact
that
it
operates
on
the
eve
of
when
the
court
was
to
make
a
decision
and
--
and
precludes
a
court's
decision
in
a
matter
that
is
then
pending
and
about
to
be
decided.
we
think
that
raise
--
raises
very
great
constitutional
questions.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
i
don't
have
any
specific
authorities
that
i
can
cite
to
you,
your
honor.
now,
i
can
explain
though
that
this
is
an
act
that
purports
to
--
to
create
a
claim
to
adjudicate
the
existence
of
the
claim
to
state
that
--
the
priority
of
the
claim,
it's
talking
about
a
claim
in
bankruptcy
and,
of
course,
it
only
relates
to
a
bankrupted
railroad.
it
relates
to
no
other
entity.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
the
bankruptcy
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
my
view
would
be
that
it's
even
more
of
a
bankruptcy
situation.
now
earlier,
there
was
some
public
interest
component
in
this
particular
case.
now
that
it's
in
liquidation,
it's
in
straight
liquidation
and
it
really
represents
a
pure
bankruptcy
just
as
any
other
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
it
is
still
a
section
77
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
it
would
be
a
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
why
we
believe
it
is
a
bankruptcy
act.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
overwhelming
component
of
this
particular
legislation
involves
bankruptcy
and
to
the
extent,
there
is
any
commerce
implication
forward,
it's
coincidental.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
our
concern
there
is
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
this
benefits
employees
who
are
not
former
employees,
who
are
not
going
to
be
working
for
other
railroads.
it
doesn't
serve
any
specific
public
purpose.
it
doesn't
benefit
the
rock
island
in
any
way
because
the
rock
island
has
no
preexisting
claim
in
our
view.
therefore,
we
are
concerned
that
the
government
could
raise
the
defense
at
the
time
of
a
tucker
act
proceeding
that
it
--
it
was
not
on
appropriate
matter
under
the
tucker
act.
all
the
staggers
act
says
is
that
our
tucker
act
remedy
--
nothing
in
this
act
shall
preclude
or
limit
a
tucker
act
remedy.
it
does
not
say
whether
in
fact
the
tucker
act
remedy
exists.
it
is
very
careful
not
to
say
that.
the
--
the
legislation
is
very
careful
not
to
say
that
particular
point.
the
government
in
their
brief
indicates
that
there
are
situations
where
a
tucker
act
remedy
would
not
be
available.
for
example,
where
there
is
no
legislative
authority
for
a
particular
taking,
they
say
that
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
remedy
under
the
tucker
act.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
there
may
also
be
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
direct
precedent
on
the
point
but
they
may
also
raise
the
defense
that
this
is
not
serving
a
governmental
public
purpose
and
therefore,
there
is
no
right
to
bring
an
action
for
compensation
under
the
tucker
act
and
we
won't
know
that
until
a
later
date
which
will
be
of
a
--
of
a
--
preclude
any
remedy
for
us.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
we
are
not
bringing
in
the
tucker
act
remedy
by
that
act.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
i
would
assume
that
the
trustee
would
bring
the
action
on
behalf
of
all
creditors.
of
course,
if
there
is
no
tucker
act
remedy,
then
the
money
is
paid
out
to
all
of
the
private
employees
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
recover
the
money.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
and
i
assume
that
would
be
the
trustee
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
--
but
--
but
it
would
come
on
a
later
date
after
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
that's
right,
your
honor.
what
--
the
judge
--
what
judge
mcgarr
wishes
to
do
at
this
point
in
the
proceeding
is
to
conclude
this
liquidation
as
soon
as
possible
because
the
liquidation
has
already
been
going
--
ongoing
for
five
years.
this
railroad
has
lost
$210
million.
it's
amassed
$250
million
of
expensive
administration
claims.
he
wishes
to
--
to
pay
as
many
claims
as
he
can
and
close
the
estate
to
get
this
matter
ended.he
believes
that
that
is
what
he
is
entitled
to
do
--
what
he
must
do
under
the
constitutional
dictates
of
the
brooks-scanlon
case.
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
they
have
ever
committed
to
paying
the
money
in
every
circumstance
and
i
believe
they
are
very
careful
in
their
brief
as
i
indicated
--
mr.
daniel
r.
murray
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
have
a
concern
about
that.
but
there
is
also
the
point
that
there
is
irreparable
harm
to
the
rock
island
in
that
an
estate
which
has
been
--
which
has
already
been
existent
in
reorganization
for
five
years
with
immense
losses
and
all
of
these
costs
of
administration
claims
that
that
is
going
to
be
prolonged
for
another
several
years
while
the
tucker
act
claim
is
being
prosecuted
and
there
is
no
reason
for
that.
there
might
have
been
a
reason
for
that
on
the
3r
act
cases
where
the
government
had
to
cease
specific
property
to
maintain
rail
service
in
the
northeast.
here,
we
are
talking
about
fungible
money
that
could
just
as
well
come
from
the
government
if,
in
fact,
any
public
purpose
is
being
serve.
we
do
not
think
there
is.
it
could
just
as
well
come
from
the
government
as
it
could
come
from
a
bankrupt
estate.
if
this
--
if
this
operates
as
a
taking,
what
the
rock
island
is
doing
in
essence
is
advancing
money
for
the
federal
government
and
that
we
submit
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
