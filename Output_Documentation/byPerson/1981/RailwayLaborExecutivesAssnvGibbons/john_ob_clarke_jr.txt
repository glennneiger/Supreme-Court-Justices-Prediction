mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
about
18
months
ago,
congress
enacted
the
rock
island
transition
and
employee
assistance
act
and
as
it
considered
to
be
an
integral
part
of
that
act,
it
added
what
it
--
what
it
considered
to
be
essential
to
rails
--
continuation
of
rail
service
in
the
midwest.
it
added
an
alternative
employee
protective
program
that
it
--
that
it
said
should
be
made
available
immediately
to
the
employees
of
the
rock
island
who
were
displaced
as
a
result
of
the
demise
of
that
carrier.
that
program
was
enjoined
approximately
nine
days,
ten
days
after
it
was
enacted,
signed
into
law
by
president
carter.
congress
readdressed
the
situation
during
the
summer
of
1980
and
in
the
staggers
rail
act
enacted
an
amendment
to
the
rock
island
act
which
was
passed
and
signed
into
law
on
october
14th,
1980.
on
october
16th,
an
order
dated
october
15th
but
actually
entered
on
the
16th,
the
court
again
enjoined,
the
district
court
again
enjoined
the
act
because
it
said
the
staggers
rail
act
was
really
only
a
cosmetic
change
in
the
law.
it
didn't
change
the
substance
of
the
act.
at
that
point
presumably
railroad
labor
executives'
association,
the
appellant
in
these
--
in
these
consolidated
cases,
had
earlier
taken
an
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
june
9th
injunctive
order.
that
appeal
is
80-415.
once
the
court
entered
the
injunctive
order
on
october
16th,
rlea
took
an
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit
because
in
amending
the
staggers
act,
congress
had
also
amended
where
the
appeal
should
go.
so
we
went
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
was
required
by
the
staggers
rail
act
amendments
to
decide
the
case
en
banc
within
60
days.
it
did,
but
unfortunately,
it
split
three-three
and
on
--
on
december
16th,
it
entered
an
order
affirming
the
district
court's
decision.
the
next
appeal
was
then
taken
by
rlea
to
this
court
and
on
april
27th
this
court
accepted
or
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
the
second
appeal
1239
case
and
deferred
probable
jurisdiction
in
the
--
or
deferred
consideration
of
probable
jurisdiction
in
the
first
case.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
point.
rlea
submits
that
the
first
case,
80-415,
the
appeal
was
properly
filed
and
timely
filed
in
this
court.
however,
the
staggers
rail
act
amendments
mooted
that
case
because
the
act,
the
injunctive
order
which
is
preventing
the
implement
--
implementation
of
the
rock
island
act
employee
protection
is
actually
the
october
injunction
and
not
the
june
injunction.
the
june
injunction
is
now
moot
and
we
submit
probable
jurisdiction
should
be
noted
in
the
case
vacated
in
grounds
of
mootness.
going
to
the
questions
that
are
before
this
court,
the
first
thing
that
the
court,
we
submit,
has
to
address
is
the
question
raised
in
the
noting
of
probable
jurisdiction.
that
is,
basically,
what
issues
are
before
the
court
at
this
time?
we
would
submit
that
when
we
filed
our
brief
the
only
issue
that
was
really
before
this
court
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
staggers
rail
act
amendments
and
the
rock
island
act
had
granted
the
estate
a
remedy
or
means
to
obtain
compensation.
if
compensation
was
available,
there
cannot
be,
we
submit,
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
property
because
the
whole
substance
of
the
--
or
it
can
be
called
the
just
compensation
clause
or
the
taking
clause
or
the
fifth
amendment
is
the
adequate
provision
of
compensation.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
has
that
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts,
but
the
problem
in
this
case
is,
first
of
all,
is
that
issue
really
before
this
court
that's
basically
in
the
taking
issue,
and
the
second
point
is,
are
the
obligations
of
contract
being
impaired?
and
that
gets
into
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
pre-existing
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
estate
which
we
submit
there
was
and
i
will
get
into
that
in
a
second
or
two.
the
trustee
creditors
and
the
trustee
below
and
the
court
below,
the
district
court,
found
that
the
rock
island
act
affected
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
property
because
the
court
indicated
that
it
came
as
a
startling
concept
to
him,
to
the
court,
that
congress
could
impose
an
obligation
upon
the
estate
and
take
$75
million
to
be
paid
to
employees.
as
he
went
on
to
say,
“congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
take
private
property
for
public
use.”
we
submit
that
that
is
looking
at
the
wrong
part
of
the
just
compensation
or
taking
clause.
what
has
to
be
looked
at,
as
this
court
indicated
before,
is
at
the
time
of
the
taking,
was
there
an
adequate
provision
made
for
compensation?
if
there
was
in
fact
an
adequate
provision,
even
though
the
money
is
not
paid
upfront,
then
there
cannot
be
an
unconstitutional
taking
because
the
vindicated
--
the
gravamen
of
an
unconstitutional
taking
is
an
uncompensated
taking
and
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
rail
act
cases
and
going
back
to
the
cherokee
case,
the
kansas
city
--
the
kansas
southern
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
everyone
agrees
to
that.
we
have
a
problem
with
the
--
the
appellees,
the
rock
island
appellees,
in
the
--
in
the
position
that
congress
exceeded
the
scope
of
its
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
by
enacting
a
private
benefit
for
employees.
they
indicated
it
as
a
basic
--
as
judge
mcgarr
in
the,
a
basic
logic
in
the
rock
island
act
which
hopefully
i
will
be
getting
to
in
a
second.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
submit
if
it's
a
taking
that's
a
direction
of
congress,
by
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
even
if
not
for
public
use.
if
congress
believes
it
was
necessary,
it
would
not
be
a
taking
clause
violation.
you
might
have
a
due
process
clause
violation
but
as
far
as
a
taking
clause
is
concerned,
we
submit,
it's
not
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--
a
violation.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
basically,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
rail
act
cases
where
the
court
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
then
in
the
part
of
the
decision
we
have
footnote
16
to
it,
the
court
talked
about
the
power
of
the
--
the
tucker
act
and
the
tucker
act
meaning
“a
remedy
available
for
a
taking
that
is
authorized
by
the
government.”
authorized
by
the
government
is
by
the
act
of
congress.here,
congress
has
specifically
authorized
the
taking
because
at
the
time
of
the
act,
it
believed
it
had
the
power
to
do
and
we
submit,
it
did
have
that
power.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
taking
and
it
is
not
a
taking
that
it
is
a
taking
--
now,
this
is
discounting
of
course
a
proper
statute,
a
--
a
regulatory
type
statute
such
as
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
but
if
we
have
a
--
if
we
--
the
only
justification
for
the
act
of
congress
is
that
it
is
a
taking
of
property.
we
--
we
do
submit
that
the
constitution
requires
that
there
be
compensation
for
that,
but
we
are
not
at
that
point.
and
this
is
the
--
the
appellant
submits
that,
first
of
all,
the
only
issue
that's
before
this
court
is
a
question
of
compensation
for
the
taking.
and
we
submit
that
there
was
a
much
simpler
question
that
seemed
to
indicate
it
is,
namely,
the
tucker
act
is
there
and
that
solves
the
compensation
issue.
the
question
of
whether
there'd
be
--
whether
there
was
a
taking
or
not
is
nonjusticiable
at
this
point
because
it
is
not
properly
presented
in
the
factual
situation
where
it
is
clear
--
a
clear-cut
concrete
situation
and
that
situation
will
not
adequate
--
will
not
be
presented.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
and
basing
it
under
the
tucker
act
provisions
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--
in
the
court
of
claims.
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
might
clarify
one
thing.
on
our
initial
brief,
we
indicated
that
the
taking
issue
can
arise
where
either
the
creditors
and
the
trustees
sue
the
government
in
the
court
of
claims
for
the
recovery
of
monies
that
were
paid
out
pursuant
to
the
act.
we
submitted
that
the
more
likely
scenario
however
would
be
that
the
creditors,
the
estate
would
actually
borrow
the
money
from
the
federal
government
because
congress
had
provided
that
money
there.
and
then
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
priority
that
110(a)
granted
to
that
debt
will
then
be
resolved
either
in
the
reorganization
court
or
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
we
will
submit
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
the
only
authority
that
might
come
close
to
that
point
is
the
case
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
submit
that
it
should
not
have
been
enjoined
because
the
tucker
act
was
available.
and
the
--
this
is
not
--
the
wilson
versus
new
case
has
sort
of
won
this
one
point.
because
in
order
to
determine
that
congress
is
taking
property
for
private
as
compared
to
public
use,
you
have
to
look
behind
the
enactment
of
--
congress'
enactment
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
reasons
that
congress
did
what
it
did,
granted
this
court
has
the
right
to
see
if
there
is
a
rational
connection.
but
if
congress
states
in
the
preamble
of
its
act
that
it's
exercising
its
powers
under
the
commerce
clause
to
enact
legislation
which
it
believes
has
a
public
purpose
and
that
the
act
it
is
doing
is
simply
compromising
an
obligation
that
already
existed,
and
this
is
why
we
submit
the
taking
issue
when
it
finally
does
come
up
is
not
really
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
we're
still
back
to
--
it
goes
back
to
the
question,
it's
not
so
much
the
taking
issue
because
the
taking
issue
in
this
case
is
really
when
does
a
regulation
become
a
taking?
that's
the
ultimate
part
of
the
taking
issue.
one
aspect
of
the
taking
issue
here
would
be
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
act
that
congress
did
was
for
public
or
private
benefit.
now,
one
thing
that
has
been
sort
of
not
highlighted
in
this
case
is
the
actual
factual
situation
which
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
in
fact
an
act
of
congress
under
its
commerce
clause
for
a
public
benefit,
a
very
strong
public
interest.
when
the
rock
island
act
was
being
considered
by
congress,
it
started
back
in
february
and
march
of
1980
before
the
abandonment
order
was
even
authorized
to
be
sought
for,
that
didn't
occur
until
april
14th.
and
when
congress
was
considering
what
to
do
with
the
demise
of
the
rock
island
and
the
directed
service
which
was
to
end
on
may
31st,
at
that
point,
there
was
no
more
authority
in
the
icc
to
authorize
any
continued
operation
over
that
line
and
the
line
would
completely
cease
and
all
service
will
end
at
that
point,
so
congress
had
to
address
that
issue.
and
in
addressing
that
issue,
congress
realized
as
this
court
has
indicated
from
back
in
the
1930s,
the
interest
of
employees
was
an
extremely
important
element
in
the
perpetuation
of
that
service.
and
in
order
to
afford
that
--
that
employee
protection,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
that
arrangements
to
help
the
people
who
are
being
affected
and
to
preserve
the
public
interest,
congress
had
to
look
at
the
interest
of
employees,
as
this
court
has
again
intended
as
part
of
the
national
interest.
and
in
doing
that
congress
worked
and
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
congress
worked
along
with
labor
and
representatives
of
rail
management.
and
the
arrangement
that
came
out
of
that
combination
of
the
parties
was
a
combination
of
the
miami
courts
for
the
march
4
hiring
agreement
and
this
particular
piece
of
legislation.
the
basic
logic
that
the
court
found
in
this
legislation
only
comes
because
he
is
disregarding
the
march
4
agreement.
the
march
4
agreement
is
an
integral
part
of
the
rock
island
legislation
and
between
the
two,
they
provide
a
form
of
protection
for
employees
who
have
spent
their
time
in
operating
this
railroad
who
would
then
be
available
for
continued
rail
operations
over
that
line.
it
takes
experienced
people
to
operate
a
railroad,
operate
it
safely
and
efficiently
and
keep
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
the
second
half
of
the
--
of
the
protection.
the
protection
to
be
adequate
for
an
employee
of
a
railroad
has
to
cover
the
situation
of
an
employee
who
was
hired
and
an
employee
who
is
not
hired.
the
march
4
agreement
was
to
encourage
carriers
to
hire
people.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
and
then
when
they
are
hired
to
give
them
some
form
of
protection.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
terminated
employees
but
who
are
still
available
for
continued
rail
service
in
that
area.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
there
is
another
advantage
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
but
that
purpose,
--
that
--
that's
immediate,
i
mean,
that's
the
way
congress
--
the
end
that
congress
used
to
accomplish
its
purpose
but
it's
a
purpose
that
congress
said
it
was
doing
was
to
provide
a
protection
for
employees
to
enable
the
continued
operation
of
lines.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
but
we
submitted
those,
your
honor,
when
you
look
at
the
--
the
agreement,
the
march
4
hiring
agreement
together
with
the
rock
island
protection
just
like
the
milwaukee
situation.
the
milwaukee
section
9
agreement
combined
with
the
march
4
agreement
gave
the
protection
for
the
interim
operations.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
but
not
on
the
milwaukee
agreement,
your
honor.
the
milwaukee
agreement
had
protection
for
people
who
were
not
working.
and
then
the
march
4
agreement
protected
those
who
were
carried
over.
but
there
is
a
very
strong
public
benefit
that
comes
out
of
this
type
of
enactment
and
that's
the
fact
that
railroad
workers
do
not
have
the
type
of
pension
systems
that
other
people
have
and
their
whole
collective
bargaining
agreements
have
protective
arrangements
build
into
it.
those
protective
arrangements
have
provided
a
sort
of
guaranteed
security
for
employees
that
in
the
event
of
any
cessation
of
operations
that
they
are
not
just
going
to
be
forgotten.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it's
not
gone,
your
honor,
but
the
benefits
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
the
only
protection
they
have
is
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--
$25
a
day
for
five
days
a
week,
and
those
benefits
are
almost
exhausted
for
most
of
them.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
a
$125
a
day
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
$125
a
week.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
there
is
a
protection
of
that
sort
but
the
guaranteed
job
security
that
these
people
have
enjoyed
over
the
years
guaranteed
them
more
than
that
type
of
protection.
it
guaranteed
them
a
different
form
of
protection.
it
guaranteed
them
sort
of
a
preservation
of
their
jobs.
and
what
we
are
facing
here
is
a
situation
where
congress
wanted
to
enact
to
this
legislation,
believed
that
its
earlier
enactments
had
require
that
that
be
imposed
in
this
case.
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
that
protection
which
it
submitted
was
in
the
public
interest
be
imposed,
it
enacted
section
106
of
the
act.
i
realize
my
time
is
very
near
the
end.
i
would
ask
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
hard
to
place
a
--
an
actual
figure
on
it
but
the
levels
of
protection
which
we
submit,
11347,
require
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
made
mandatory
here
by
17(a)(1)
of
the
--
17(a)
of
the
milwaukee
act,
is
that
there'd
be
guaranteed
income
for
six
years
with
all
cost-of-living
adjustments
added
into
it,
in
other
words
100%
of
your
income
for
six
years
from
the
date
of
your
effect,
or
an
option
on
the
employee
to
take
a
separation
allowance
was
equals
three
and
for
people
with
over
ten
years
--
five
years
of
service,
360
times
your
last
daily
rate
of
pay.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
unfortunately,
the
seventh
circuit
has
taken
a
different
position
but
the
important
thing
on
this
is
the
icc
up
until
1976
always
considered
itself
to
have
the
discretion
to
impose
this
level
or
this
type
of
protection
in
an
entire
line
of
abandonment
case,
that
in
1979
when
congress
--
1976,
we
submit,
congress
took
that
discretion
away.
in
1979,
it
transferred
the
remaining
discretion
and
the
power
of
the
icc
had
to
authorize
abandonments
over
to
the
reorganization
court
and
the
legislative
history
in
the
rock
island
act
prior
to
the
whole
confirmation
of
the
abandonment
coming
up
in
the
reorganization
court
indicates
that
congress
believed
that
the
'79
act
and
the
'76
act,
based
on
the
'76
act,
had
required
that
level
of
protection
in
this
case.thank
you.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
proceed?
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
okay,
thank
you,
sir.
the
one
point
that
has
been
--
seems
to
be
focused
on
and
becomes
almost
like
the
central
point
is
whether
or
not
this
act,
the
106
and
110
of
the
act
create
a
private
benefit
rather
than
serves
a
public
purpose.
now,
we
submit
that
the
rationale
given
by
the
creditors
for
what
is
the
purpose
--
the
whole
purpose
behind
labor
protection
misses
the
mark.
this
court
in
the
louden
case
and
then
in
the
icc
versus
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
case
stressed
that
the
only
justification
for
imposing
employee
protection
is
part
of
the
public
national
transportation
system
is
to
increase
this
ability
of
the
labor
force.
i
just
like
to
read
one
short
paragraph
or
part
of
a
paragraph
from
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
case
315
u.s.373.
this
is
the
abandonment
case.
“there
is
nothing
in
the
act,”
namely
the
interstate
commerce
act,
“to
prevent
the
commission
from
taking
action
in
furtherance
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
merely
because
the
total
impact
of
that
action
will
include
benefits
to
the
private
persons
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--
by
the
carrier's
employees.”
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
brooks-scanlon
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
to
allow
a
railroad
to
eventually
withdraw
itself
from
rail
service
but
until
the
public
interest
and
continued
rail
services
are
satisfied,
the
public
interest
factor
remains
a
viable
consideration
and
the
railroad
can
be
required
to
continue
on
even
if
there
is
an
erosion
of
the
interest
of
secured
creditors
and
that's
in
the
--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
brooks-scanlon
doesn't,
your
honor,
but
the
new
haven
case,
i
believe
the
penn-central
merger
and
the
denver
and
rio
grande
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
indicate
that
the
brooks-scanlon
doctrine
is
qualified
by
the
fact
that
all
our
railroad
cannot
be
allowed
to
continue
indefinitely
at
a
loss.
there
can
be
a
reasonable
period
of
time
while
a
public
solution,
public
interest
solution
is
found
and
we
submit
the
difference
that
we
have
with
the
creditors
and
the
trustee
on
this
is
that
part
of
the
public
interest
solution
that
has
to
be
found
here
is
how
do
you
provide
for
a
stabilized
labor
force?
now,
the
icc
case
goes
on
to
indicate
that
the
louden
case
specifically
recognized
that
the
imposition
of
conditions
similar
to
those
sought
here
might
strengthen
the
national
system
through
their
effect
on
the
morale
and
stability
of
railway
workers
generally.
exactly
the
same
considerations
of
national
importance
are
applicable
and
operative
here.
and
we
submit
they're
applicable
and
operative
here
as
well
because
the
entire
purpose
of
labor
protection
is
not
just
for
rock
island
people.
it
is
for
all
railroad
employees.
mr.
murray
has
indicated
that
the
railway
system
is
a
national
community
type
of
establishment.
what
happens
to
me
--
what
happens
to
one
railroad
here
affects
another
railroad
either
through
direct
intercourse
of
commerce
or
through
the
passing
of
the
word
of
mouth.
if
employees
know
that
if
the
railroad
goes
bankrupt
and
they
are
going
to
be
cut
out
in
the
cold
unless
they
are
lucky
enough
to
get
a
job
with
somebody
else,
why
should
a
railroad
employee
stay
with
any
other
carrier
today
that's
in
financial
problems?
it's
because
of
that
consideration
and
the
need
to
continue
railroad
workers
on
their
jobs
and
how
that's
quite
available
to
discontinue.
this
is
exactly
what
the
act
did
and
i
realize
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
