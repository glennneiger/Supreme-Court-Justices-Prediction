well,
it's
now
been
decided
that
there
was
no
such
viability,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
unions
didn't
really
want
this
legislation,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
there
was
a
history
of
icc
total
abandonments
where
they
had
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
not
been
imposed
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
union
really
didn't
want
to
take
the
risk.
that's
rather
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
side
doesn't
think
there
was
much
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
march
4th
agreement
intended
to
enable
sale
of
the
lines
by
reducing
the
obligation
of
the
employees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but,
ms.
stillman,
what
if
we
say
it's
a
taking
for
private
use
then
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
event
the
question
of
an
injunction
comes
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
but
if
you
are
not
talking
about
a
real
taking
but
just
as
--
just
a
unconstitutional
interference
with
property
then
you
can't
avoid
the
injunction
process.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
avoidance
of
the
question
as
i
have
taken
it
an
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
murray,
do
you
have
any
precedence
for
this
argument
to
support
you
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is,
are
there
any
precedence
that
you
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
the
klein
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
understand.
your
concern
is
that
if
you
were
admitted
to
a
tucker
act
remedy
and
you
brought
it,
the
united
states
might
--
may
defend
on
the
ground
though
there
isn't
any
tucker
act
remedy
because
counsel,
the
argument
they
--
they
gave
here
today
is
--
was
not
for
public
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
concerned
they
might
make
that
kind
of
defense
notwithstanding
the
argument
here?
