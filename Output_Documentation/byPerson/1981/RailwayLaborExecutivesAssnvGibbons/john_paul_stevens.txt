justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
everyone
agree
in
this
case
that
assuming
there
was
a
taking
in
the
sense
that
you
are
taking
money
out
of
the
estate
that
it
was
a
taking
for
public
use
rather
than
a
transfer
of
property
from
one
group
of
private
people
to
another
group
of
private
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
--
there
could
be
a
tucker
act
remedy,
i
take
it
would
have
to
be
not
really
a
taking
in
the
sense
you
take
it
from
x
but
a
taking
for
public
use,
otherwise
it
wouldn't
be
a
tucker
act
remedy,
would
there?
if
it's
a
taking
from
the
railroad
to
the
employees,
who
are
private
parties,
is
there
necessarily
a
tucker
act
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
not
for
public
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
is
the
authority
for
the
proposition
that
even
if
it's
not
for
a
public
use
and
nevertheless
is
a
tucker
act
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
a
footnote
in
that
opinion
that
says
everybody
agreed
it
was
for
public
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
have
any
authority
right
on
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct
the
march
4
agreement
related
to
employees
continued
to
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
this
protection
is
for
people
who
were
terminated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
benefits
of
the
statute,
if
it's
held
valid,
will
all
go
to
terminated
employees
not
to
the
same
people
who
benefit
from
the
march
4
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
protect
them
in
the
event
they
don't
get
further
jobs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
it
just
doesn't
fit
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
all
for
people
who
are
still
working.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
without
intruding
on
your
time
because
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
all
right
with
the
chief
justice,
because
i
--
i
--
you
--
your
position
in
part
is
that
this
did
not
create
a
new
obligation
but
merely
compromised
a
preexisting
obligation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
tell
me
what
in
your
view
the
magnitude
of
the
preexisting
obligation
was
and
was
it
larger
or
smaller
than
the
new
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
your
position
that
--
that
the
employees
would
have
been
entitled
to
that
if
this
statute
had
never
been
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
congress
didn't
attempt
to
intervene
in
the
proceeding
to
save
that
rock
island
--
should
continue
to
operate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
accepted
what
the
reality
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
my
suggestion
--
my
question
really
is
do
you
think
congress
intended
to
amend
or
repeal
any
part
of
the
reorganization
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't
attempt
to
intervene
in
the
preceding
to
overturn
any
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
united
states
would
be
foreclosed
from
arguing
in
the
court
of
claims
that
it
was
a
taking
for
private
use
and
therefore
the
remedy
is
not
available?
i
know
you
are
the
--
the
appellees
here,
of
course,
argue
that
the
remedy
is
available
because
they
don't
want
to
get
--
they
want
to
get
the
money
somewhere
assumedly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
not
the
united
states
have
the
right
to
argue,
“oh,
no,
this
was
a
taking
for
public
use,
the
--
this
--
there
was
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
make
it
--
administer
of
expense
and
not
incur
an
absolute
liability”?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
the
same
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
congress
made
a
finding
that
the
general
motors
could
run
the
ford
company
better
than
ford
does
and
transfer
their
assets
to
general
motors
out
of
the
public
benefit.
would
that
be
a
taking
for
public
use?
they
said
interstate
commerce
will
benefit
because
they
are
more
efficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
it
is
difficult
because
there
is
no
precedent
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
that
really
supports
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
in
deciding
his
position
in
this
case
did
the
government
give
any
consideration
whatever
to
the
position
of
the
investors
in
this
railroad
concededly
bankrupted
and
unable
to
operate
further
on
assets
of
$204
million
and
the
government
imposing
an
administrative
claim
of
$75
million
dollars
ahead
of
those
investors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
anybody
would
have
invested
in
another
railroad
if
this
can
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government
could
--
on
your
theory,
the
government
could
have
said
it
or
approved
or
authorized
an
administrative
claim,
a
brand
new
one
of
$204
million.
why
stop
at
six
years
of
compensation?
it
could
have
been
16.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
--
is
the
government
interested
in
encouraging
people
to
invest
in
railroads?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
government
wants
to
take
them
over?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
