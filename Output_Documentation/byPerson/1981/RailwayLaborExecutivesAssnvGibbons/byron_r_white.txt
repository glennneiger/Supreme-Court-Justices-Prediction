mr.
clarke,
it
may
be
that
if
the
united
states
takes
a
property
for
public
use
that
the
taking
is
not
subject
to
an
injunction
because
there
is
--
compensation
has
been
promised,
but
how
about
the
situation
where
there
is
a
taking
--
say
the
united
states,
actually
we
are
taking
your
property
but
we
are
going
to
take
it
for
private
use,
and
you
can't
complain
now
because
you
can
go
to
the
court
of
claims
and
get
paid
for
it?
we
are
going
to
take
your
money
and
you
can
get
it
back
by
going
to
the
court
of
claims.
but
the
plaintiff
then
says,
“well,
it
may
be
just
fine
when
the
taking
is
for
public
use.
this
is
for
private
use
and
we
should
be
able
to
enjoin
you.”
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
some
authority
on
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
you
do
if
you
don't
have
on
the
point
that
justice
stevens
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
at
issue
here.
can
the
--
should
the
district
court
have
enjoined?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
district
court
thought
of
that
--
that
it
was
entitled
to
give
an
injunction
if
there
was
a
taking
for
private
use,
it
seems
to
me
the
taking
issue
is
fairly
opposed
here.
if
you
happen
to
agree
with
the
--
if
you
happen
to
agree
that
the
injunction
would
be
authorized
in
the
event
of
the
taking
for
a
private
use,
then
the
taking
issue
is
opposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
subject,
let
me
just
pose
a
question
because
i'm
glad
you
are
getting
that.
in
your
brief
although
i
notice
perhaps
other's
relative
brief
in
page
19
you
have
the
sense,
“when
a
government
regulation
adjusting
the
burdens
and
benefits
of
economic
life
between
private
parties
is
held
to
be
a
taking
the
government
ordinarily
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
choice
whether
to
rescind
the
regulation
or
pay
just
compensation.”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
contend
this
case
comes
within
that
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
an
adjustment
between
private
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
first
like
to
know
whether
you
think
that
sentence
applies
to
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
congress
should
be
given
a
chance
to
decide
whether
or
not
if
it
is
a
taking,
they
want
to
pay
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they
have
not
yet
made
an
unequivocal
determination
of
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
paid
out
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
we
said
there
was
a
taking,
you
think
--
you
would
like
to
know
whether
it's
a
taking
and
that
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
congress
could
know
whether
to
repeal
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
to
act
within
15
days
as
i
understand
it.
it's
our
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
would
have
to
act
within
15
days,
would
they
not?
because
if
the
injunction
is
set
aside
there
is
a
duty
to
decide
the
matter
within
15
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
a
rather
accelerated
time
schedule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
--
do
--
do
you
see
this
case
as
one
that's
within
the
tucker
act
if
we,
(a)
said
there
was
a
taking,
or
(b)
we
said
there
was
not
a
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
suppose
we
just
pass
the
questions,
say
--
say--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
i
suppose
that
would
bind
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
--
mr.
murray,
do
you
think
that
the
--
do
you
think
the
icc
could
have
imposed
any
kind
of
a
--
of
a
--
a
termination
burden
on
the
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
which
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
just
flatly
disagree
with
the
government's
position
and
your
opponents
that
there
was
any
room
at
all
in
this
reorganization
proceeding
to
impose
any
termination
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
labor
protective
provisions
were
--
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
some
authority
to
impose
some
labor
protective
provisions
in
this
case
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
they
had
just
discretion
to
do
so.
suppose
it
did
and
then
congress
came
along
and
said,
“well,
we
are
going
to
exercise
your
discretion
for
you.”
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
decide
that
to
--
to
hold
for
you,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
for
us,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
if
it
is
just
a
total
abandonment,
just
a
withdraw,
no
liquidation
or
no
--
it
is
not
in
section
77
reorganization
and
it's
not
--
it's
not
liquidating
under
--
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
railroad
says
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
we
are
going
to
withdraw
from
the
railroad
business,
but
we
have
got
a
lot
of
money.we
are
going
to
go
to
some
other
businesses,
do
you
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
that's
not
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
employer
in
justice
rehnquist's
examples
said,
“well,
as
long
as
i
operate,
i
have
to
live
up
to
the
law
but
if
it's
too
expensive,
i'm
going
to
quit,”
and
if
he
quit,
there'd
be
different
questions.
the
government
then
said,
“well,
you
can
quit
but
you
are
going
to
have
to
pay
your
employees
for
a
couple
of
years.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that's
what
your
case
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
really
suggesting
that
the
--
that
the
estate
is
so
depleted
that
it
would
not
cover
all
administrative
expenses
including
the
$75
million
if
it
is
imposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
congress
had
added
the
bottom
line
and
said,
“by
the
way,
to
the
extent
the
bankruptcy
acts
must
be
amended
to
achieve
the
above,
they
are
so
amended.”
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
had,
there'd
be
no
separation
of
powers
problem,
wouldn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
separation
of
powers
means
it
has
to
be
uniform.
you
--
you
rely
on
the
bankruptcy
act
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bankruptcy
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
wouldn't
be
a
separation
of
powers
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
more
administrative
expense.
justice
byron
r.
white
more
administrative
expense.
