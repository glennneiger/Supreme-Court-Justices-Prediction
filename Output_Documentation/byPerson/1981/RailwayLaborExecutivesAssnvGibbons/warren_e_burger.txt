let
me
if
i
understand
your
earlier
point.
suppose
the
railroad
designed
that
it
was
going
to
just
cut
off
some
of
its
outlying
services
and
the
icc
approved
and
a
severance
pay
was
ordered
as
a
condition
by
the
icc.
that
would
certainly
be
an
appropriate
corporate
purpose,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
--
is
there
any
relationship
between
that?
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
got
an
impression
from
you
that
if
the
railroad
were
an
ongoing
operation,
you
would
have
a
different
situation
with
respect
to
the
hypothetical
i
just
presented
to
you.

not
say
that.
