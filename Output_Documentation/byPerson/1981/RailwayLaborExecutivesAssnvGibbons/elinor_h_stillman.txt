ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
federal
appellees
appeared
here
today
in
the
support
of
rlea's
appeal
from
the
october
order
from
the
seventh
circuit's
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
october
order
holding
an
act
of
congress
--
enjoining
an
act
of
congress
on
grounds
of
its
unconstitutionality.
we
regard
the
earlier
cases
moot.
the
federal
appellees
submit
that
the
amended
rock
island
act
does
not,
as
the
district
court
concluded,
affect
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
private
property.
we
make
two
basic
arguments
on
this
point.
first,
we
submit
that
the
act
does
not
take
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
second,
if
contrary
to
our
submission,
the
court
were
to
find
that
it
did
affect
the
taking
of
property,
we
submit
that
a
reasonable,
proper
and
adequate
provision
for
compensation
has
been
made
in
the
--
in
the
tucker
act
and
therefore
for
two
reasons,
it
was
improper
for
the
district
court
to
enter
this
injunction.
either
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
or
there
was
no
violation
to
remedy.
i'm
going
to
address
the
taking
question
first,
a
question
that
we
do
urge
the
court
to
decide
in
this
case
and
to
understand
what
--
why
we
are
trying
to
say
that
this
act
is
not
a
taking,
you
have
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
consider
the
crisis
that
congress
was
responding
to
when
it
was
considering
and
when
it
enacted
the
rock
island
act.
and
you
have
to
consider
also
the
legal
and
historical
context
with
respect
to
employee
protection
against
which
congress
was
also
--
to
--
to
which
congress
was
also
responding.
the
rock
island
act
did
not,
as
the
private
appellees
occasional
suggest,
leap
unannounced
out
of
congress'
brow
three
days
before
the
district
court
authorized
the
abandonment
here.
in
september
of
1979,
the
rock
island
act
totally
ceased
operations
overall
of
its
lines.
it
was
a
critical
importance
to
the
middle
west
particularly
to
the
shipment
of
--
of
farm
products
out
there.
in
the
months
thereafter,
this
transportation
system
was
held
together
just
essentially
by
direct
service
orders
given
by
the
icc.
congress
was
justifiably
concerned
with
the
effect
of
the
liquidation
of
so
large
a
railroad
not
only
on
the
middle
west
but
on
transportation
services
generally
on
its
--
its
ripple
effect
with
respect
to
other
lines.
and
the
rock
island
act
which
was
the
congressional
response
to
this,
the
senate
report
on
this
issued
in
march
of
1980.
this
act
called
for
the
implement
--
among
other
things
for
the
implementation
of
a
plan
either
negotiated
by
the
parties
or
devised
by
the
icc
for
providing
limited
compensation
for
those
employees
who
were
displaced
as
a
result
of
the
rock
island's
termination
of
operations.
it
further
provided
the
cost
of
plan
would
be
charge
to
administrative
expenses
of
the
estate,
that
the
benefits
could
be
paid
through
federally
guaranteed
loans
and
that
there
would
be
a
top,
a
maximum
of
$75
million,
it
could
not
exceed
that
amount.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
no,
it
gave
certain
directed
service
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--
authority
to
the
icc.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
it
was
trying
--
what
congress
was
really
trying
to
do
here
was
create
a
situation
which
would
encourage
buyers
for
these
lines.
they
want
these
lines
to
stay
in
business
with
other
buyers.
they
--
they've
put
money
on
the
act
for
non-railroad
carriers
to
buy
some
of
these
lines.
they
--
they
want
--
they
want
the
existing
service
to
stay
there
to
the
extent
possible
and
the
states
want
this
too.
and,
they
view
this
labor
protection
as
counsel
for
rlea
tried
to
suggest
as
integral
to
holding
the
system
together
and
i
think
what
he
was
trying
to
suggest
to
you
here
when
he
was
talking
about
the
march
4th
agreement
is
that,
a
large
incentive
for
the
union
to
enter
into
that
agreement
was
that
they
assumed
that
congress
was
preceding
along
the
lines
to
enact
this
other
legislation
which
would
take
care
of
these
other
employees.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
they
regarded
it,
i
think,
as
part
of
a
package.
that
was
one
of
the
incentives
to
them.
maybe
they
would
have
been
wiser
not
to
sign
this
agreement
in
march
4th,
1980
and
wait
to
see
if
the
other
thing
would
be
upheld
but
they
didn't.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
but
they
didn't.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
i
think
congress
--
here,
what
i
would
like
to
say
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
i
don't
believe
congress
thought
it
was
overturning
anything
as
--
as
the
counsel
for
rlea
has
suggested,
congress
is
--
they
looked
at
the
law
affecting
employee
protection
arrangements
when
they
were
--
when
they
were
devising
the
statute.
what
was
on
the
books
then
affecting
this
railroad
was
the
milwaukee
act
--
section
17(a)
of
the
milwaukee
act
which
said,
“certificates
of
abandonment
shall
include
conditions
providing
fair
and
equitable
arrangements
for
the
employees
shall
include.”
it
was
absolute
language.
now,
it's
true
that
there
had
been
interpretations
of
that
language
as
giving
discretion
to
the
reorganization
court
similar
to
what
the
icc
had
considered
that
it
had
under
the
4-r
act,
discretion
not
to
impose
employee
protection
arrangements
in
some
cases
of
whole
line
abandonments.
but
just
as
the
icc
had
always
thought
they
had
the
discretion
to
create
exceptions
to
their
general
rule
that
they
wouldn't
a
--
apply
these
conditions
and
whole
line
abandonments,
that
discretion
remained
here.
there
was
a
very
real
possibility
while
congress
was
devising
this
operation
--
this
legislation
that
this
estate
could
have
had
imposed
on
it
what
are
called
the
new
york
dock
conditions.
and
that
is
a
very
high
level
of
employee
protection
which
goes
up
to
six
years.
and
as
to
the
question
of
how
much
liability
there
might
have
been
for
this
railroad,
for
the
estate
if
the
new
york
dock
conditions
had
been
imposed,
i
think
you
got
some
idea
of
that
from
footnote
27
on
page
52
of
the
private
appellees'
brief
where
they
discuss
what
happened
under
the
milwaukee
statute.
you
know
--
you
know
the
rock
island
provisions
here
were
modeled
on
section
6
and
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes.
i
think
that
money
was
put
in
escrow
funds
but,
yes,
i
would
say
that
the
government
would
have
recourse.
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
there
was
a
very
large
potential
liability
here.
now,
it
wasn't
certain
whether
it
would
be
imposed.
it
was
just
it
could
be
imposed.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
this
is
after
the
fact
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--
that
the
time
congress
was
legislating
this
there
was
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
i
--
i
will
say
that
neither
the
unions
nor
the
estate
had
any
concrete,
absolute
guarantee
that
that
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--
but
the
icc
had
always
said,
“well,
we
--
we
make
exceptions
in
appropriate
cases,”
and
the
icc
had
never
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
there
were
risks
on
both
sides
--
and
the
congress
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
and
the
congress
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
congress
addressing
these
risks
and
--
and
i
might
say
again
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
money
that
they
were
talking
about
here,
footnote
27,
on
the
private
appellees'
brief
says
that
it
was
calculated
for
the
milwaukee
railroad
that
if
new
york
dock
conditions
had
been
--
been
applied
there,
the
liability
might
have
been
anything
up
to
$1
billion.
they
say
the
best
estimate
was
$350
million.
milwaukee
railroad
was
roughly
comparable
in
size
to
the
rock
island.
i
think
it
had
a
few
more
employees
but
not
very
many
more
employees.
so
--
and
the
icc
in
its
recommendation
report
to
the
reorganization
court
when
it
recommended
approving
the
abandonment,
they
had
a
brief
section
on
labor
protection.
they
made
no
recommendation
because
they
said,
“as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
this
is
being
taken
care
of
by
congress,”
so
we
don't
feel
that
we
should
make
a
recommendation.
they
did
note
their
policy
of
not
having
applied
it
in
whole
line
abandonments
but
they
never
--
they
nevertheless
told
the
reorganization
court
a
viable
option
is
in
position
of
new
york
dock
conditions.
that
was
a
very
large
liability
and
congress
looking
at
the
state
of
the
law
which
would
have
permitted
the
imposition
of
that
liability
simply
said,
“we
think,
considering
all
of
the
factors
here,
the
necessity
to
have
labor
stability
which
will
encourage
other
rail
buyers
to
buy
these
lines."
we
--
we
think
we
also
want
to,
by
the
way,
encourage
employees
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--
of
other
marginal
carriers.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
that's
--
that's
true,
that's
true.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
that
would
be
an
exercise
of
congress'
commerce
power
which
as
--
always
would
have
to
be
tested
for
a
rational
basis
as
to
whether
that
was
a
rational
decision
or
a
reasonable
consideration
of
the
class.
and,
i
think
it
would
stand
or
fall
on
that.
we
think
here
this
was
a
rational
response.
the
rock
island
was
the
only
large
railroad
in
the
middle
west
that
was
in
these
desperate
straits.
they
were
simply
applying
a
legislative
solution
that
fit
the
particular
problems
they
were
addressing,
a
serious
problem
in
interstate
commerce
which
they
had
every
--
every
right
under
the
commerce
power
to
address.
i
would
like
also
to
address
the
question
of
whether
this
was
just
giving
private
property
from
one
group
of
people
to
another
group
of
people.
i
don't
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
think
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
think
there
are
two
ideas
there
that
are
included
there
in
the
sentence.
i
think
there
is
one
idea
that
was
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
an
adjustment
between
private
parties
which
is
critical
to
the
public
interest.
and
--
and
to
address
that
point,
what
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
is
the
case
of
dayton-goose
creek
railway
against
united
states,
a
very
early
case
which
involved
an
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes,
i
think
it
does.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
but
then
i'd
like
to
explain
where
i
think
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--
that's
not
applicable.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes,
yes,
yes.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
let
me
say
this.
if
congress
failed
to
act
now
and
that
money
is
paid
out
and
this
court
considers
it
a
taking,
it
will
be
bound.i
mean,
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
once
the
money
is
paid
out.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
it
isn't
paid
out
yet.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
that's
correct.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
well,
that's
right.
but
then
what
happens
is,
the
icc
then
has
to
devise
a
plan
and
then
it's
approved
by
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes,
that's
true,
that's
true.
there
are
some
dispute,
i
think,
between
the
private
appellees
and
the
rlea
as
to
how
long
it
wold
take
before
you
could
get
actual
payments
of
money.
but
what
i
would
like
to
say
going
to
this
question
of
the
private
parties,
in
the
dayton-goose
creek
railway
case,
what
happened
there
was
the
icc
had
a
regulation
according
to
which
they
said,
“if
railroads
are
earning
profits
over
a
certain
amount,
above
a
certain
rate
of
return,
we
consider
those
excess
profits
and
we
are
going
to
require
that
they
put
half
of
those
excess
profits
into
this
general
fund
and
this
general
fund
will
provide
equipment
and
loans
for
other
weaker
carriers
and
we
see
this
is
essential
to
the
national
transportation
system.”
this
court
upheld
that.
now,
that
was
taking
property
from
one
party
and
giving
it
to
another
party
and
the
court
found
out
a
proper
use
of
icc
power.
now,
what
we
say
here
is
that
the
money
that
was
in
the
estate
at
all
--
the
$75
million
if
you
want
to
segregate
it
out,
at
all
times
existed
under
the
--
under
the
potential
liability
under
the
milwaukee
act
under
section
17(a)
of
being
awarded
to
the
union
under
the
employee
protection
arrangement.
that
was
the
state
of
the
law.
that
--
that
potential
claim
existed
there.
all
that
congress
did
was
fix
that
claim
at
a
lower
amount
and
make
it
certain
that
there
would
be
$75
million.
so,
really,
all
it
did
was
amend
the
law
to
take
what
was
potential,
make
it
actual,
and
to
fix
it
at
a
lower
level.
we
--
we
don't
see
this
as
a
taking
of
property.
we
don't
see
this
as
--
as
an
irrational
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
nor
do
we
see
it
as
to
an
intervention
into
the
reorganization
court's
jurisdiction.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
if
you
say
there
is
a
taking,
it's
within
the
tucker
act.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
the
tucker
act
is
there.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
it
will
bind
the
government
if
they
do
nothing.
if
the
money
is
paid
out,
if
--
if
you
say
the
tucker
act
is
there,
the
money
is
paid
out,
and
it
later
is
determined
to
be
a
taking
and
the
estate
has
paid
out
$75
million,
the
estate
would
have
a
claim
in
the
court
of
claims
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
this
is
a
somewhat
more
difficult
question
because
of
course
under
united
states
against
testan,
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
no
liability
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims
except
where
there
is
a
right
for
damages
and
of
course
the
just
compensation
clause
provides
such
a
right.
we
certainly
would
have
to
agree
that
if
there
were
a
separation
of
powers
violation
or
anything
that
there
probably
would
not
be
a
money
remedy
in
the
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
court
of
claims.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes,
in
which
account
then
but
we
--
but
we
very
strongly
argue
here
that
there
--
there's
--
is
no
serious
question
that
there
has
not
been
a
rational
--
in
rational
terms,
some
benefit
to
the
public
interest.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
but
we
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
your
honor,
congress
made
a
finding
in
this
legislation
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest.
now
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
think
it
is.
i
think
the
public
--
oh,
yes
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
guess
one
reason
this
is
difficult
is
because
that's
a
sort
of
substantive
due
process
to
us
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes.
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
you
have
suggested
i
think
in
your
opinion
in
moore
against
city
of
east
cleveland
that
what
the
court
has
done
sometimes
in
the
past
is
apply
what
you
call
a
huge
test
of
substantive
due
process
test
or
the
taking
test.
it's
sometimes
hard
to
tell
which
test
the
court
is
applying
because
to
some
extent
when
you
talk
about
justice
and
fairness
under
the
takings
test,
you
are
taking
about
some
of
the
same
factors
that
you
talked
about
under
substantive
due
process.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
i
don't
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
so
clear
here
that
there
is
a
public
--
that
the
public
use
of
this
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--
money
is
to
benefit
the
public.
the
fact
that
it
is
being
given
to
private
parties
just
doesn't
bear
on
that
question.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
i'm
reluctant
to
recklessly
open
up
the
treasury
in
the
court
of
claims
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
this
injunction
should
stand
because
we
think,
clearly,
there
is
no
basis
for
standing.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
under
our
theory
the
existing
law
authorized
the
imposition
of
a
--
a
much
larger
liability,
a
law
that
was
on
the
books,
a
law
that
the
investors
were
aware
of
and
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
railroad
invest
--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
your
honor,
i
can't
speak
for
the
government
on
that
point.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
but
i
would
simply
say
that
we
believe
that
the
injunction
here
was
erroneous
on
both
grounds
that
is
--
that
it
is
not
a
taking
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
if
it
is,
the
tucker
act
remedy
prevents
the
injunction.
thank
you.
