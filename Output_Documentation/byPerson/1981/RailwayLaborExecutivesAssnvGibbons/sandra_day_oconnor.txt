counsel,
assuming
that
the
court
were
to
find
that
it
was
not
a
taking
for
a
private
purpose,
the
railroad
could
then,
would
you
concede,
recover
that
amount
that
it
paid
out
under
the
tucker
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
long
would
it
take
to
process
a
tucker
act
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
what
really
is
the
problem
is
that
it
delays
a
partial
distribution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
the
harm
will
be
the
difference
between
the
interest
rate.
it
should
get
on
your
tucker
act
claim
and
what
you
could
do
with
your
money
if
you
got
it
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
could
the
partial
distribution
not
be
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
a
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
partial
pro
rata
distribution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
would
you
say
that
in
the
case
of
an
ongoing
enterprise
or
even
a
reorganization
of
the
railroad
that
for
the
government
to
impose
such
liability
would
also
lack
a
public
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
it
was
my
understanding
we
really
have
upheld
legislation
of
that
kind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
deal
with
the
argument
that
presumably
the
investors
in
the
railroad
understood
that
some
liability
might
well
attach
in
any
event
under
the
other
act
that
was
enforced,
the
milwaukee
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
murray,
do
you
--
are
there
any
specific
authorities
that
truly
resolve
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
act
may
be
said
to
be
an
act
of
bankruptcy,
the
act
that
we're
considering
that
congress
passed
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
so
as
to
bring
in
the
play,
the
uniformity
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
a
railroad
which
is
ceasing
to
operate
maybe
the
bankruptcy
stage
is
--
is
indicative.
i'm
not
sure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
my
--
my
concern
is
whether
this
act
may
properly
be
characterized
as
a
bankruptcy.
