mr.
david
w.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts
of
this
case
reveal
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
monty
eddings,
was
16
years
old
at
the
time
he
intentionally
murdered
an
oklahoma
highway
patrol
trooper,
a
man
by
the
name
of
larry
crabtree,
with
a
sawed-off
shotgun
as
the
trooper
approached
the
vehicle
which
mr.
eddings
had
been
driving.
the
murder
occurred
after
mr.
eddings
announced
to
the
other
members
of
the
car
that
he
would
blow
the
trooper
away
if
he
hassled
him,
then
loaded
the
sawed-off
shotgun,
waited
as
the
trooper
approached,
and
fired
the
shotgun,
striking
him
in
the
heart
from
a
distance
of
approximately
six
or
seven
feet.
the
issues
in
this
case
are,
number
one,
whether
the
united
states
constitution
prohibits
a
state
from
imposing
a
penalty
of
death
in
every
case
involving
a
person
who
was
under
the
age
of
18
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
without
a
consideration
of
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
without
a
consideration
of
the
character
and
record
of
the
individual
defendant.
the
petitioners
also
raise
the
question
whether
or
not
the
punishment
imposed
in
this
case,
the
penalty
of
death,
by
a
person
who
was
16
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
for
the
crime
of
the
intentional
murder
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
is
disproportionate,
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
state
contends
that
the
adoption
of
a
chronological
age
as
the
sole
determinative
factor
in
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
to
impose
the
penalty
of
death
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
considerations
has
support
neither
in
reason
nor
in
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
we
submit
that
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
individual
case,
that
oklahoma's
decision
to
impose
the
death
penalty
upon
the
petitioner
who
intentionally
murdered
one
of
our
law
enforcement
officers
does
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
first,
of
course,
our
contention
is
that
should
be...
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
chronological
age
limit,
it
should
be
a
legislative
decision.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
feel
like
that
this
court
should
never
have
to
answer
that
question.
this
court,
in
barker
versus
wingo,
was
asked
to
set
the
six-month
period
of
time
within
which
a
defendant
had
to
receive
a
speedy
trial.
it
declined
to
do
so,
stating
that
its
approach
in
setting
fixed
lines
like
that
must
not
be...
cannot
be
rigid.
instead,
it
set
forth
four
factors
which
must
be
considered.
i
feel
like
that
is
the
approach
that
the
court
has
used
in
the
woodson
case
and--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
don't
know
what
that
age
would
be.
mr.
david
w.
lee
if
the
individual
was
ten
years
old,
would
assume
that
the
objective
factors
would
not
support
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
david
w.
lee
okay.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
impose
the
death
penalty
on
an
individual
who
was
ten
years
old.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
that
looking
at
that
by
itself
would
be
enough
to
convince
anybody,
including
this
court,
that
a
ten-year-old
person
under
no
circumstances
should
receive
the
death
penalty.
like
i
say,
i
don't
think
the
objective
factors
which
the
court
used
in
striking
down
georgia's
death
penalty,
when
it
noted
that
georgia
was
the
only
state
in
the
union
that
imposed
the
penalty
of
death
for
the
crime
of
rape...
i
think
that
in
that
case
it
could
look
toward
the
50
states
and
see
that
a
very
small
minority
of
states
would
impose
a
penalty
of
death.
also,
i
don't
anticipate
that
oklahoma
will
ever
be
in
that
position.
i
am
glad
of
the
fact
that
we
only
have
one
individual
on
our
death
row
that
is
in
this
position,
and
i
would
hate
to
be
in
the
position
of
arguing,
look,
we've
got
a
number
of
juveniles
on
death
row,
that
shows
that
it
is
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
do
so.
i
think
we
have
been...
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
have
shown
that
we
have
been
very
careful
in
making
that
decision,
and
have
not
abused
our
discretion.
however,
the
facts
in
this
case
support
our
decision
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
considering
the
victim
and
the
character
and
record
of
this
individual
defendant.
we
urge
the
court
to
uphold
the
punishment
of
death
in
this
case.
we
ask
the
court
to
recognize
that
we
have
covered
and
followed
our
own
certification
procedures
very
carefully
in
this
case.
we
have
found
that
under
our
statute
on
certification,
the
test
being
if
the
individual
is
able
to
make
a
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
and
is
to
be
held
accountable
for
his
acts
in
accordance
with
eight
specific
guidelines.
we
think
the
evidence
supports--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
there
are
a
number
of
other
guidelines
that
the
sentencer
would
have
to
take
into
consideration.
there
are
eight
specific
guidelines,
and
sophistication
and
maturity
are
one
of
those
guidelines.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
certification
statutes
in
general
are
an
admission
by
the
state
that
there
is
a
certain
time
in
life
when
we
don't
know
whether
an
individual
should
be
held
accountable
for
his
actions.
as
this
court
noted
in
breed
versus
jones,
an
overwhelming
number
of
jurisdictions
in
this
country
have
certification
procedures.
so
does
the
federal
government.
and
we
think
that
if
we
admit
that
we
are
not
able
to
make
that
decision
on
every
16-year-old
person,
as
long
as
we
followed
our
statute
in
that
regard
in
this
case,
which
we
think
we
have,
as
long
as
the
sentencer
has
found
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances,
pursuant
to
our
death
penalty
statute,
in
order
to
guide
him
in
his
discretion,
as
long
as
he
has
taken
age
to
be
a
mitigating
circumstance,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
we
feel
like
the
death
penalty
should
be
upheld.
in
the
case
of
bell
versus
ohio,
this
court
reversed
a
conviction
of
a
person
who
was
16
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
murder.
it
said
that
the
ohio
statute
was
incorrect
because
it
prohibited
the
sentencer
from
taking
into
consideration
such
things
such
as
the
age
of
the
defendant,
but
this
court
in
that
decision
did
not
in
any
way
suggest
or
imply
that
the
age
of
the
offender,
mr.
bell
in
that
case,
would
be
considered
to
be
anything
more
than
one
of
several
mitigating
circumstances.
we
ask
that
this
court's
decision
in
that
case
and
in
lockett,
and
woodson
not
be
extended
to
completely
bar
the
execution
of
persons
who
were
16
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
without
a
consideration
of
their
background,
character,
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
individual
offense.
we
believe
that
the
adoption
by
this
court
of
a
chronological
age
below
which
the
state
could
never
go
in
imposing
the
penalty
of
death
would
create
an
arbitrary
and
artificial
line
in
the
determination
of
the
death
penalty.
as
i
stated
earlier,
by
analogy,
this
court,
when
requested
to
adopt
a
six-month
guideline
within
which
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
should
receive
a
trial
under
the
mandates
of
the
speedy
trial
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment,
this
court
declined
to
do
so,
setting
forth
factors
for
the
trial
court
to
weigh
and
consider
in
making
a
determination
whether
the
speedy
trial
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment
had
been
violated.
we
feel
like
the
determination
by
the
state
as
far
as
the
accountability
and
responsibility
of
a
criminal
defendant,
if
anything,
is
a
much
more
complex
decision.
furthermore,
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
we
contend
that
the
legislatures
in
this
country
should
be
allowed
to
respond
to
sociological
and
technological
changes
which
may
occur
in
their
society,
and
to
recognize
that
younger
people
in
this
country
are
becoming
mature
at
an
earlier
age.
we
feel
like
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
react
to
the
increase
in
and
the
horror
of
juvenile
crime,
and
to
impose
the
penalty
of
death
in
a
proper
case.
we
think
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
oklahoma's
best
record
that
the
penalty
of
death
should
be
imposed.
the
facts
as
i
have
stated
earlier
reveal
a
murder
which
by
all
standards
and
definitions
was
an
intentional
one.
it
was
undertaken
with
malice
aforethought,
which
is
required
by
our
statute.
we
have
an
individual
defendant
who
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
murder
by
all
accounts
was
not
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol.
he
is
an
individual
who
the
other
occupants
of
the
vehicle
attempted
to
persuade
him
not
to
shoot
the
trooper
as
he
approached
the
car.
this
includes
three
people
in
the
car
who
were
younger
than
the
petitioner,
two
14-year-old
people
and
a
15-year-old
person.
they
all
testified
they
tried
to
stop
him
from
killing
the
trooper
as
he
approached
the
car.
he
is
an
individual
who,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
four
expert
witnesses
on
the
subject
of
his
mental
status
who
testified,
according
to
none
of
them
was
he
insane
or
psychotic.
all
the
doctors
testified
that
he
knew
the
difference
between
right
or
wrong,
that
he
was
not
mentally
ill.
even
in
his
own...
even
his
own
expert
witnesses...
he
had
a
psychologist
who
testified,
and
he
contended
that
his
problem
was
the
fact
that
he
had
an
antisocial
behavior
problem.
he
was
a
sociopath.
both
the
psychiatrists
that
testified
for
the
petitioner
stated
that
he
was
not
the
victim
of
parental
abuse.
dr.
gagliano,
who
testified...
who
was
the
psychiatrist
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
stated
that
he
knew
the
difference
between
right
or
wrong
at
the
time
he
pulled
the
trigger,
but
that
it
did
not
apply
to
him.
he
said
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
mr.
eddings'
personality,
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
mind.
he
also
testified,
as
did
the
other
psychiatrist,
that
there
was
no
thinking
disorder,
no
psychosis,
and
that
he
knew
the
difference
between
right
or
wrong,
as
i
stated.
also,
the
testimony
of
his
juvenile
probation
officer
from
the
state
of
missouri,
steven
dorn,
testified,
"monty
is
sharp".
he
stated
he
was
an
individual
of
average
intelligence.
in
addition,
we
have
an
individual
who
expressed
absolutely
no
remorse
for
what
he
did.
this
was
evidenced
by
statements
he
made
to
the
other
law
enforcement
officers
in
jail
after
he
was
arrested.
he
stated
at
one
point,
"if
you
don't
turn
out
this
light,
i
will
shoot
you
just
like
i...
i
have
already
shot
one
of
your
people
and
i
will
shoot
you,
too,
unless
you
turn
out
that
light.
"
he
made
the
statement
immediately
after
the
murder
to
two
law
enforcement
officers,
"i
have
already
killed
one
of
your
people,
i
will
kill
you,
too,
if
i
get
out.
"
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
your
honor.
this
was...
those
particular
statements
were
what
the
sentencer
used
in
his
determination
that
the
defendant
was
capable
of
criminal
acts
of
violence
in
the
future.
that
was
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
which
were
found.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
your
honor,
the
law
in
oklahoma,
according
to
our
statute,
is
that
the
sentencer
is
to
consider
any
mitigating
circumstances
which
the
defendant
might
have
to
offer.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes.
mr.
david
w.
lee
no,
your
honor.
of
course,
i
have
read
that
statement
many
times,
and
i
might
note,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
that
it
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
brief,
i
think.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
they
said
that
his...
i
think
the
statement
that
the
trial
court
made
was
that
he
would
not
consider
the
petitoner's
violent
background.
mr.
david
w.
lee
one
of
his
propositions
was
that
the
defendant
should
not
receive
the
death
penalty
because
of
his
background.
that
was
one
of
the
issues
he
raised,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
the
family
background
of
the
petitioner
was
useful
in
explaining
why
he
behaved
the
way
he
did.
it
does
not
excuse
his
behavior.
so
i
suppose
indirectly
they
dealt
with
that
particular
part
of
it.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
the
remark
is
ambiguous.
it
could
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
he
was
not
going
to
consider
the
juvenile's
previous
juvenile
record
in
missouri,
which
was
extensive,
although
it
was
not
anything
approaching
what
he
did
in
this
particular
case.
it
could
mean,
and
i
think...
my
interpretation
of
it
is
that
the
trial
court
did
not
consider
the
fact
of
his
family
background
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
he
listened
to
evidence.
he
allowed
him
to
introduce
into
evidence
anything
he
wished,
but
the
violent
background,
which
i
assume
he
meant
was...
i
believe
his
juvenile
officer
testified
on
one
occasion
eddings
had
washed
the
walls
and
his
stepfather
came
home
and
slapped
him
around
a
little
bit,
and
then
he
was
subject
to
some
slapping
around
and
some
beating
by
his
father.
i
think
that
should
be
weighed
with
the
fact
that
his
own
two
expert
witnesses
said
that
he
was
not
the
victim
of
parental
abuse.
now,
i
think
that
if
he
was
the
victim
of
parental
abuse
to
the
fact
that
it
causes
some
mental
retardation
or
psychosis
or
something
like
that,
that
might--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
don't
think
that
is
what
we
normally
consider
to
be
severe
child
abuse.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
don't...
well,
for
one
thing,
he
was
14
years
old
before
he
went
to
live
again
with
his
father.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
i
don't
consider
it
to
be
the
kind
of
severe--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
i
think
there
are
different
degrees
of
slapping
around,
and
i
don't
think
this
is
the--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
if
there
is
abuse
which
affects
an
individual
to
the
point
which
he
is
psychotic,
mentally
retarded,
where
it
directly
causes
an
extreme
emotional
disturbance
which
this
court
said
may
be
a
circumstance
that
might
accompany
the
killing
of
a
police
officer...
i
think
that
was
in
roberts
versus
louisiana...
that
is--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
the
juvenile
officer
said
that
the
beatings
were
inconsistent,
or
the
slappings
around,
or...
i
think
he
said
slappings,
beatings.
i
believe
that's
what
he
stated.
they
were
not
to
the
extent
where
he
stated
that
he
noted
the
petitioner
coming
in
with
any
marks
on
him.
the
petitioner's
own
sister
said
that
she
had
never
seen
any
marks
on
the
petitioner.
mr.
dorn,
the
probation
officer,
said
that
he
had
never...
there
was
nothing
in
his
file
to
indicate
that
he
was
a
victim
of
parental
abuse.
so,
in
defense
of
what
the
judge
said,
this
individual
was
a
product
of
a
middle
class
background.
he
was
an
individual
who
came
from
a
broken
home,
but
in
order
to
consider
what
happened
to
him
to
be
mitigating,
i
think
probably
you
would
have
to
consider
the
backgrounds
of
most
criminals
to
be
mitigating,
and
he
was
just
not
legally
convinced
that
this
provided
a
legal
excuse
for
what
the
petitioner
did.
going
back
to
the
lack
of
remorse
of
the
petitioner
that
is
also
reflected
in
the
examination
that
was
conducted
at
the
state's
request
at
the
state
mental
institution,
the
psychiatrist
there
stated
that
the
petitioner
showed
no
remorse
at
any
time
for
what
he
had
done.
we
contend
that
the
only
fact
in
this
record
that
is
mitigating
in
the
petitioner's
behalf
is
his
age.
if
he
was
not
16
years
old,
this
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
cold-blooded
murder
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
for
no
legal
justification
whatsoever.
this
court
in
roberts
versus
louisiana
noted
that
there
are
circumstances
that
might
attend
the
killing
of
a
police
officer
which
might
be
considered
to
be
mitigating.
the
court
listed
youth,
the
absence
of
any
prior
convictions,
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol,
and
i
am
quoting
here,
"an
extreme
emotional
disturbance
or
the
existence
of
circumstances
which
the
offender
reasonably
provided
a
moral
justification
for
his
conduct.
"
however,
here--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--that
is
our
position.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
lee
a
personality
disorder,
and
i
believe
they
talked
about
it
being
in
terms
of
antisocial
personality
or
the
fact
he
is
a
sociopath--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--that
would
be
our
position.
the
man
is
a
sociopath.
dr.
gagliano
said
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
his
mind.
what
is
wrong
is
with
his
personality.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
he
demonstrated
all
the
characteristics
of
a
sociopath,
and
even
his
own
psychiatrist
admitted
that
he
had
an
antisocial
personality.
this
is
a
lack
of
development
in
some
aspects
of
his
personality,
and
it
is
demonstrated
by
his
inability
to
express
remorse,
impulsiveness,
inability
to
respond
to
punishment,
which
this
petitioner
demonstrated,
and
apparently
it
showed
up
very
clearly,
according
to
the
observations
of
all
psychiatrists.
no,
we
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
a
person
is
a
sociopath
should
be
considered
to
be
a
mitigating
circumstance.
we
don't
think--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--that
is
a
characteristic--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
that
is
one
of
the
guidelines,
sophistication
and
maturity.
but
sociopaths--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
it
makes
a
determination
of
right
from
wrong
based
on
those
eight
guidelines,
and
that
is
guideline
6,
and
the
certifying
judge
in
this
case
specifically
dealt
with
that
specific
guideline.
he
noted
that
the
petitioner
was
in
the
tenth
grade,
but
physically
he
appeared
to
be
much
older
than
the
way
he
was.
mr.
david
w.
lee
the
lack
of
maturity?
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
that
sociopaths
generally,
no
matter
what
age,
are
going
to
display
immature
conduct.
they
are
irresponsible,
and
certainly
the
act
of
murder
is
certainly
an
irresponsible
and
immature
act,
and
our
court
has
specifically
said
that
emotional
maturity
is
not
something
that
the
court
needs
to
specifically
find
in
a
certification
proceeding.
i
don't
have
that
listed
in
my
brief,
but
it
is
in
shurfield
versus
state,
511
pacific
second.
and
i
don't
think
the
state
should
be
required
to
show
that
a
killer
is
emotionally
mature,
because
probably
he
is
not
going
to
be,
and
certainly
a
sociopath
is
not
going
to
be.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
would
argue
against
it.
i
would
say
as
long
as
he
is
not
psychotic,
as
long
as
his
thinking
is
ordered,
as
long
as
he
knows
the
difference
between
right
or
wrong,
as
long
as
he
is
of
average
intelligence,
he
is
not
suffering
from
mental
retardation,
and
as
long
as
the
state
has
properly
made
a
certification
finding,
then
he...
that
should
not
be
a
mitigating
circumstance,
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
respond
to
values
in
society
like
the
rest
of
us
do.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
it
is
the
mcnaughton
rule
according
to
eight
guidelines.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes.
well--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--yes.
well,
that
is
in
our
statute,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
noted
that
that
is
the
test
of
criminal
responsibility
in
oklahoma,
is
the
difference
between
right
or
wrong,
the
mcnaughton
rule.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
i
think
it
is
a
little
bit
more
sophisticated
when
we
are
talking
about
whether
to
certify
a
juvenile
as
an
adult
than
whether
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
insane
or
not.
in
oklahoma,
the
test
to
determine
insanity
is
the
right
versus
wrong
test.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
there
is
something
wrong
with
his
personality.
i
agree
to
that.
but
that
is
all
there
was.
he
was
a
sociopath,
and
he
was
a
young
sociopath,
but
a
sociopath
according
to
all
the
testimony,
and
we
don't
think
that...
i
mean,
if
we
get
to
the
position
of
saying,
if
you
are
a
sociopath,
that
might
give
you
a
break
in
whether
or
not
you
receive
the
death
penalty
or
not,
i
don't
think
that
is
what
we
want
to
do.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
was
envisioned
by
this
court
when
it
said
extreme
emotional
disturbance
in
roberts
versus
louisiana.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
ever
intended
to
require
a
sentencer
who
is
looking
at
a
person
who
has
murdered
a
police
officer
to
say,
well,
i
am
going
to
consider
the
fact
that
you
are
a
sociopath
in
making
this
determination
whether
you
receive
the
death
penalty.
i
think
the
sentencer
should
consider
other
things,
and
the
sentencer
in
this
case
specifically
considered
his
age,
but
that's
the
only
thing
that
i
think
legally
should
have
been
considered.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
if
he
is
of
lower
intelligence,
i
think
that
should
be
considered--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--such
as?
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
like
i
say,
in
this
particular
case,
he
used
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
tenth
grade.
he
also
mentioned
the
fact
in
his
certification
order
that
he
appeared
to
be
much
older
than
a
tenth
grade
person.
those
were
the
two
specific
things
that
the
certification
judge
in
this
case
used
in
making
that
decision.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
a
sentencer,
he
should
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
person
physically.
i
think
that
should
be
a
determination
in
making
a
certification
decision.
like
i
say,
i
think
that
is
what
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
probably
we
are
talking
about
something
different
in
the
sentence
as
opposed
to
the
certification.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
it
should
be
limited.
i
think
it
should
be...
i
think
the
whole
thrust
of
gregg,
and
i
think
it
is
what
judge
woodson
tried
to
comply
with
when
he
was
making
his
statements,
is
guided
discretion,
and
if
this
sentencer
would
have
considered
things
like
the
fact
that
he
got
slapped
around
to
a
certain
extent,
i
think
he
might
have
felt
like
he
was
running
a
foul
of
the
mandates
of
gregg
and
the
other
decisions
that
say,
we
want
guided
discretion
in
making
our
decision
as
to
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty
or
not.
i
think
he
felt
like
he
wasn't
completely
free
to
consider
just
anything,
and
footnote
12
in
lockett
says
that
the
senator
is
free
to
exclude
irrelevant
factors
that
aren't
mitigating,
and
i
think
that
is
probably
what
he
was
trying
to
comply
with.
mr.
david
w.
lee
he
can
go
back
on
post-conviction,
your
honor.
there
is
a
post-conviction--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
that
would
be
through
post-conviction--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--or
post-conviction
replaced
that.
mr.
david
w.
lee
he
has
to
present
a
reason
why
he
didn't
raise
it
the
first
time
around.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
sir.
well--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--not
directly.
he
really
didn't
directly
raise
it.
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
been
very
lenient
about
considering
issues
which
have
not
been
raised
the
first
time
or
second
time.
mr.
david
w.
lee
as
far
as
federal
habeas
is
concerned,
or
as
far
as
going
back
and--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--according
to
the
case
law,
he
has
got
to
give
some
reason
why
he
didn't
raise
it
initially,
and
i
don't
know
what
his
reason
was.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
the
earlier
cases
of
roberts
and
woodson,
i
think,
also
should
have
anticipated
lockett
as
well.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
will
be
arguing,
if
he
raises
it,
i
will
be
arguing
against
him
not
being
able
to
raise
it,
but
they
have
been
flexible
in
allowing
that
to
be
raised
in
their
post-conviction,
but
i
would
say...
in
answer
to
your
question
i
would
say
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
raise
it
unless
he
can
show
some
reason
why
he
didn't
raise
it
to
begin
with.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
sir,
and
i
will
be
opposing
it.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that
is
probably
true,
but
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
they
did
discuss
it
to
a
certain
extent.
we
would
not
want
a
remand
of
this
case
for
that
reason.
if
there
are
any
further
questions.
