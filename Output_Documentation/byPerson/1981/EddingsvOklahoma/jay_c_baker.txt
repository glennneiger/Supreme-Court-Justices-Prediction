mr.
jay
c.
baker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
having
been
certified
for
trial
as
a
juvenile
within
the
oklahoma
juvenile
justice
system,
monty
eddings
was
convicted
on
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere
for
the
murder
of
an
oklahoma
highway
patrolman,
an
offense
he
committed
at
the
age
of
16
years,
four
months.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
on
a
16-year-old
youth
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
prohibited
by
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
the
question
is
actually
phrased
as
a
16-year-old
youth.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
he
would
be
about
20
now.
this
happened
in
1977.
twenty
years
of
age.
because
of
the
treatment
of
the
case
by
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
by
the
state
in
its
brief,
one
special
point
should
be
made.
we
are
not
here
talking
about
accountability
or
criminal
responsibility.
i
concede
to
the
state
their
right
to
fix
the
age
of
criminal
responsibility.
the
state
in
essence
asked
for
that
latitude
which
they
receive
under
the
due
process
clause
under
the
eighth
amendment.
it
is
our
position
this
is
a
very
narrow
issue,
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
upon
a
16-year-old
child.
whatever
age
the
state
wishes
to
fix
for
relinquishing
children
to
the
adult
court
system,
i
grant
their
power.
there
is
in
my
argument
one
assumption.
that
assumption
is
that
there
is
an
age
somewhere
below
which
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
put
a
child
to
death.
the
question
is,
what
is
that
age?
in
gregg,
this
court
stated
that
death
is
a
punishment
unique
in
its
severity
and
irrevocability,
different
in
kind
from
any
other
punishment
imposed,
and
indeed
it
is.
in
subsequent
cases
such
as
lockett
and
woodson,
the
court
stated
it
is
necessary
to
focus
upon
the
particular
character
of
the
defendant
to
determine
if
the
punishment
is
proportionate
to
the
offense
and
to
the
person.
this
court
has
on
innumerable
occasions
acknowledged
youth
as
a
most
mitigating
circumstance.
in
fact,
in
every
instance
in
which
the
court
has
made
reference
to
mitigating
factors
or
given
examples
of
them,
youth
has
been
in
there.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
is
another
problem
in
the
case.
the
trial
judge
made
the
finding
that
he
was
precluded
by
oklahoma
law
from
considering
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
the
background
of
the
defendant.
he
did
consider
youth,
but
he
made
the
statement
that
he
could
not
consider
anything
else,
and
of
course,
we
think
that
is
in
violation
of
lockett.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
understand
it
to
mean,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
obviously
did,
the
history
of
the
boy
in
the
juvenile
system,
the
burglaries,
the
fight
he
was
in,
his
trouble
with
his
parents,
being
bounced
from
one
home
to
another
home.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
would
certainly
be
one
solution.
lockett
would
mandate
a
remand.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
is
true.
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
considering
that
issue
merely
made
the
statement
that
the
juvenile
knew
right
from
wrong.
therefore,
he
can
be
put
to
death.
they
begged
the
question.
they
used
the
mcnaughton
test
of
sanity
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
juvenile
could
be
put
to
death.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
was
an
inadvertent
error
for
which
i
take
full
responsibility.
it
should
have
been
raised.
but
under
the
oklahoma
statute,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
consider
these
mitigating
circumstances
anyhow.
the
oklahoma
statutes
provide
for
automatic
appeal,
and
they
state
certain
findings
the
appellate
court
must
make
to
affirm
any
sentence
of
death,
and
among
those
is
a
comparison
of
other
cases
and
the
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstance.
our
court
just
didn't
do
it.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
don't
see
how
they
could
think
such,
especially
their
interpretation
of
especially
atrocious
and
cruel.
they
gave
such
a
broad
standard
there
that--
mr.
jay
c.
baker
--going
back
to
godfrey,
the
crime
was
a
horrible
crime.
any
murder
involves
some
element
of
being
atrocious.
any
murder
involves
an
element
of
being
cruel.
the
crimes
for
which
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed
are
those
that
are
especially
cruel,
and
mr.
godfrey
walked
up
to
a
mobile
home
and
shot
two
people.
i
don't
see
any
distinction
between
that
and
this.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
would
concede
that,
and
also
the
element
of
torture
is
what
the
court
focused
on.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
no.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
no,
i
don't
question
that.
i
don't
try
to
defend
the
crime.
i
address
myself
to
the
defendant.
it
was
a
horrible
crime.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that's
age.
age
and
the
background
which
produced
this
unfortunate
product
of
our
society.
this
court
has--
mr.
jay
c.
baker
--my
suggestion
is
that
he
be
given
a
life
sentence.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
would
be
cheaper
than
putting
him
to
death.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
there
has
been
an
enormous
amount
of
money
spent
up
to
this
point.
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
more
spent.
i
have
read
figures
before
on
the
cost
of
executing
someone.
it
is
much
more
than
putting
them
to
death.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
precisely.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes,
much
cheaper.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
the
question
assumes
that
we
can
measure
maturity.
there
are
no
good
tests
for
measuring
one's
maturity.
in
fact,
it
is
difficult
to
define
maturity.
studies
in
fact
suggest
that
at
about
the
point
of
15
or
16...
i
am
referring
to
studies
by
renn,
colberg,
and
turrell
which
are
mentioned
in
our
brief...
there
is
a
regression
during
the
years
of
stormy
adolescence.
when
the
kids
start
to
develop
into
adolescence,
are
subjected
to
these
pressures,
they
actually
regress
in
terms
of
making
judgmental
decisions.
further,
any
such
testing
like
that
would
subject
the
cultural
minorities
to
the
death
penalty
because
the
tests
are
biased
against
them.
my
position
is
that
we
grant
them
measureable
exposure
to
living,
to
the
life
experience
before
we
hold
them
accountable
as
adults.
i
suggest
the
age
of
18
because
that
is
the
age
accepted
universally,
and
it
has
constitutional
significance,
too.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
there
are
24
states,
i
believe,
that
provide
that
youth
is
to
be
considered
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
six
states
state
boldly,
we
will
not
execute
anyone
under
the
age
of
18.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
it
is
my
suggestion,
your
honor,
that
we
judge
these
evolving
standards
by
not
the
availability
of
capital
punishment
but
by
its
use.
in
our
history,
and
things
today
show
without
question
that
this
country
just
has
not
excecuted
children.
it
has
been
1948
since
a
16-year-old
was
executed.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
as
applied
to
youth.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
in
the
last
ten
years?
none
that
know
of.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
one
involuntary
execution.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
don't
think
we
can--
mr.
jay
c.
baker
--i
don't
think
we
can
consider
the
last
ten
years,
because
of
the
problems
we've
had
with
the
death
penalty
in
a
legal
sense.
i
am
going
back
to
1864,
and
we
just
don't
have
a
history
of
executing
children.
of
course,
there
is
no
death
penalty
anywhere
in
western
europe
now.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
by
furman,
yes.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
believe
almost
all
of
them,
yes.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes.
but
in
that
vein,
i
do
not
see...
these
laws
merely
have
provisions
that
relinquish
children
to
the
adult
justice
system.
i
don't
see
in
a
legislative
judgment
the
decision
to
transfer
children
from
the
juvenile
system
to
the
adult
system
as
tantamount
to
a
judgment
that
we
are
going
to
put
them
to
death.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
your
honor,
these
statutes
don't
specifically
state
that
we
are
going
to
execute
people
under
18.
the
state
enacts
its
death
penalty
statute,
and
then
they
jump
over
to
another
volume
of
their
code
to
juvenile
justice,
and
without
even
thinking
of
the
death
penalty,
they
say,
hey,
there
are
certain
children
that
we
can't
take
care
of
in
our
juvenile
system,
we
are
going
to
let
them
go
to
adult
court.
but
that
decision
to
certify
or
relinquish
jurisdiction
to
the
adult
court
then
makes
them
theoretically
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes,
sir.
every
state
in
the
country
has
a
juvenile
justice
system.
our
law
over
the
past
100
years
has
learned
to
treat
children
differently
than
we
do
adults,
because
they
are
a
different
kind
of
person.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
is
correct.
oklahoma,
for
example,
as
most
other
states,
has
provisions
for
transferring
a
juvenile
from
the
juvenile
system
to
the
adult
system.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
no,
your
honor.
it
is
on
the
basis...
for
example,
in
oklahoma,
they
can
transfer
him
merely
because
he
has
an
adult
co-defendant,
to
save
money.
there
are
eight
reasons
for
which
they
can
pass
them.
only
one
either
directs
itself
toward
the
defendant
or
toward
the
crime.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
is
the
sixth
standard,
yes.
our
court
has
stated
that
they
can
be
transferred
without
any
finding
that
they
are
mature.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
decisions
which
are
mentioned
in
the
amicus
brief,
our
point
is
specifically
stated,
that
immature
defendants
can
be
transferred.
but
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite.
it
is
one
ground
upon
which
the
transfer
can
be
made.
the
history
of
juvenile
jurisdictions
or
juvenile
executions
in
this
country
show
that
much
like
rape,
is
a
punishment
imposed
upon
the
blacks.
for
example,
georgia
has
executed
40
juveniles.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
no.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
it
just
goes
to
the
inherent
vice
of
the
execution
of
children.
the
inherent
cruelty
of
it.
monty
eddings
is
white,
but
georgia
has
executed
40
people;
they
had
one
white.
florida
has
executed
13
juveniles,
all
black.
virginia
has
executed
24;
only
three
white.
it
is
the
same
pattern
throughout
the
country.
it
is
the
people
who
are
poor,
and
the
minorities
who
are
affected
by
this.
let
us
not
think
for
one
minute
that
i
would
be
standing
here
today
if
in
sapulpa,
oklahoma,
i
had
had
some
money.
if
i
could
have
brought
in
good
psychiatrists
for
this
boy,
good
psychologists,
i
wouldn't
be
here
today.
he
could
have
bought
his
way
out
of
it,
in
spite
of
the
crime.
but
as
the
record
shows,
we
worked
with
volunteers,
we
worked
with
state
psychologists.
it
would
appear
that
there
have
probably
been
100
persons
under
18
executed
since
1864.
only
13
of
those
were
16
or
under.
thus,
my
point
is,
our
experience
has
shown
that
there
has
been
one
terrific
decline
in
juvenile
executions.
since
the
forties,
there
have
been
only
five
under
18,
all
black,
incidentally.
at
the
time
of
furman,
there
were
only
14
on
death
row
out
of
620.
those,
incidentally,
were
under
20.
we
don't
have
statistics
on
how
many
of
those
were
under
the
age
of
18.
i
would
suggest
there
were
probably
very
few
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
furman
that
were
under
18.
we
go
up
to,
as
this
court
as
suggested,
to
capital
juries,
to
see
what
they
are
doing.
as
of
october
20th,
there
were
891
on
death
row
in
this
country.
seventeen,
or
1.9
percent,
are
under
the
age
of
18.
eleven
are
black.
the
point
is,
to
take
the
language
of
this
court,
the
extreme
rarity
with
which
the
death
penalty
is
imposed
upon
children.
the
chance
of
execution
for
a
juvenile
is
too
attenuated
to
have
any
significance
served
our
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
the
figures
i
have
just
noted
are
current
figures.
these
are
capital
juries
since
gregg.
since
furman,
i
should
say,
but
since
the
gregg
statute
was
approved.
there
are
currently
891
on
death
row
at
this
time.
seventeen
of
them
are
juvenile.
the
point
is,
the
percentage
is
so
small
that
it
can't
have
any
measureable
contribution
to
our
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
if
what
were
raised?
mr.
jay
c.
baker
of
youths,
you
mean?
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
suppose,
if
the
country
ever
got
to
the
point
where
it
could
accept
it,
and
would
do
it,
it
could,
but
the
thing
is,
it
just
is
something
we
haven't
done.
judges,
juries
have
found
more
reasons
for
not
convicting
young
people,
or
for
showing
mercy.
they
are
set
out
in
our
brief,
but
you
frequently
see
a
jury
refuse
to
convict
merely
because
of
youth.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
was
his
statement.
of
course,
he
didn't
consider
anything
other
than
youth,
and
it
was
our
effort
to
show
that
aside
from
youth
there
were
other
strong
mitigating
circumstances
that
led
monty
eddings
to
end
up
on
the
oklahoma
turnpike
that
day.
it
was
almost
like
we
had
him
programmed
for
this
event
to
occur,
had
him
raised
by
a
stepfather
who
is
a
policeman,
who
beats
him,
and
having
the
policeman
killed,
you
know.
we
send
monty
back
to
his
father.
being
the
product
of
a
divorce.
as
the
record
shows,
an
alcoholic,
often
streetwalking
mother.
a
father
who
is
an
inconsistent
authoritarian,
and
all
this
coupled
with
adolescence
and
psychological
testimony
which
shows
clearly--
mr.
jay
c.
baker
--i
would
suggest
there
is
also
the
issue
that
the
court
faced
in
godfrey,
oklahoma's
interpretation
of
its
statute.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument
for
any
16-year-old.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
it
is
my
suggestion
that
there
are
mitigating
circumstances,
that
there
are
other
circumstances
besides
youth
that
mitigate
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
in
this
case.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that
is
proposition
one.
that
is
the
narrow
issue,
your
honor.
i
just
superimpose
upon
that
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
particular
defendant.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
because
of
the
lockett
violation,
and
because
of
the
other
mitigating
circumstances.
otherwise,
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
there
is
one
cited
in
the
brief.
i
don't
have
it
off
the
top
of
my
head.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
would
welcome
the
court
doing
that.
there
are
two
ways
you
can
read
godfrey.
one
way
would
indicate
that
is
what
the
court
did
in
godfrey.
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
it.
i
read
godfrey
as
just
saying
the
lower
court
gave
too
broad
an
interpretation
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
if
the
statutes
are
properly
construed,
yes.
there
are,
i
suggest,
many
reasons
why
18
should
be
the
point
below
which
we
don't
impose
capital
punishment.
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
of
our
constitution.
the
american
law
institute
in
their
model
penal
code
has
a
provision
that
absolutely
forbids
execution
of
any
juvenile
under
the
age
of
18.
all
european
countries
which
still
retain
capital
punishment
have
an
absolute
prohibition
against
the
execution
of
anyone
under
the
age
of
18.
president
carter
has
signed
the
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights,
which
prohibits
the
execution
of
defendants
under
the
age
of
18.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
the
time
of
the
offense.
the
american
convention
on
human
rights,
also
signed
by
president
carter,
has
an
absolute
prohibition
against
the
execution
of
juveniles.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
it
was
submitted
and
is
still
there,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
it
has
not
to
this
date
been
ratified.
i
mention
it
only
to
show
that
the
current
thought
in
europe
and
apparently
in
south
america
is
that
execution
of
juveniles
is
barbaric.
there
is
no
longer
a
western
european
country
with
even
capital
punishment,
but
of
the
eastern
european
countries
that
have
capital
punishment,
they
all
forbid
the
execution
of
persons
under
the
age
of
18.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
no
country
has
a
constitution
like
ours.
eighteen
is
also
the
age
at
which
people
can
be
drafted,
be
married,
drink
alcohol,
be
subjected
to
involuntary
subscription
into
the
service.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
yes.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
believe
it
is
there.
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
read
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
jay
c.
baker
--i
think
we
should
make
a
distinction,
too,
between
a
certified
juvenile
and
an
adult.
the
mere
fact
that
monty
eddings
or
any
other
child
is
certified
for
trial
in
the
adult
court
system
does
not
make
him
an
adult.
he
is
still
a
child.
i
see
us
as
we
are
striving
in
our
development,
where
we
will
reach
a
point
some
day
where
i
don't
believe
that
capital
punishment
will
be
tolerated
at
all.
probably
not
in
my
lifetime,
but
as
we
march
in
this
progress,
as
we
strive
to
become
better,
i
urge
that
we
not
regress
to
the
point
where
we
execute
children.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
quite
honestly,
your
honor,
i
believe
we
are
worse
off
now
than
we
were
before
furman.
much
worse
off.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
we
are
much
worse.
that
is
my
own
personal
opinion.
but
before
furman,
we
had
a
situation
where
in
the
courtroom
where
i
am
from
that
decision
was
the
jury's.
they
couldn't
pass
the
buck
to
anybody.
whether
the
defendant
lived
or
died
was
up
to
the
jury.
now,
we
give
them
standards.
we
tell
them,
the
law
says,
you
know,
if
you
find
such
and
such,
you
will
consider
putting
the
defendant
to
death.
it
lets
them
pass
the
buck,
so
to
speak,
to
the
legislature.
i
think
we
are
worse
off
than
we
were
at
the
beginning.
that
is
what
i
see
in
the
courtrooms
from
the
part
of
the
country
i
come
from.
and
prosecutors
use
these
standards
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that,
yes,
you've
got
to
consider
it
now.
if
you
find
one,
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
and
it
is
not
balanced
by
a
mitigating
circumstance,
kill
him.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
agreed
with
furman
at
the
time
it
was
decided.
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
i
would
prefer
going
back
to
the
way
we
were
before
furman.
but
my
hindsight
is
always
20-20.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
statement,
and
that
is,
the
only
purpose
i
can
see
in
executing
a
16-year-old
child
is
pure
and
simple
retribution,
vengeance,
and
i
don't
think
society's
lust
for
vengeance
is
strong
enough
that
we
have
to
start
killing
our
children.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
and
gregg
said
it
was.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
but
i
am
talking
about
narrow
channeled
retribution
toward
our
youth.
when
they
are
21,
22,
23,
the
court
has
approved
it.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
that's
true,
in
the
light
of
evolving
standards.
but
we
are
talking
about
a
16-year-old,
and
we
are
talking
about
capital
punishment.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
there
are
statutes.
legislatures
agree
with
me.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
am
not
aware
of
any
decisions.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
i
am
aware
of
one
from
arizona
that
disagrees
with
me.
mr.
jay
c.
baker
louisiana,
yes.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
georgia
case.
i
know
there
is
a
kentucky
case
that
is
on
appeal
within
the
kentucky
system.
we
would
ask
the
court
for
consideration
to
reverse
the
case
for
the
imposition
of
a
life
sentence
upon
monty
eddings.
