justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
a
capital
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma.
when
eddings
was
16
years
old,
he
shot
and
killed
a
state
highway
patrol
officer
at
the
time
eddings,
with
three
younger
juveniles,
was
running
away
from
their
missouri
homes.
he
had
a
history
of
emotional
problems,
had
been
raised
in
a
difficult
family
situation,
and
there
was
testimony
that
his
mental
and
emotional
development
were
at
a
level
several
years
below
his
chronological
age.
the
oklahoma
capital
punishment
statute
provides
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
that
evidence
may
be
presented
as
to
mitigating
and
aggravating
circumstances.
eddings'
age
was
considered
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
but
this
was
viewed
as
outweighed
by
aggravating
circumstances
primarily
the
deliberate
shooting
of
a
state
officer
without
provocation
other
than
the
fact
that
eddings
have
been
stopped
on
a
state
highway
for
erratic
driving.
although
the
trial
court
admitted
evidence
as
to
eddings'
family
history
and
emotional
instability,
it
declined
to
consider
these
as
mitigating
circumstances.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
agreed
and
a
sentence
of
death
was
affirmed.
in
lockett
against
ohio,
we
held
that
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
require
in
a
capital
case
that
the
sentencing
authority
not
be
precluded
from
considering,
as
a
mitigating
factor,
any
aspect
of
a
defendant's
character
or
record.
we
think
the
oklahoma
court's
committed
error
in
failing
to
consider
eddings'
background
in
mitigation.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
insofar
as
it
imposed
the
death
penalty
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
this
court
is
not
unaware
of
the
extent
of
which
minors
engage
increasingly
in
violent
crime
nor
do
we
suggest
an
absence
of
legal
responsibility
where
crime
is
committed
by
a
minor.
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
only
with
the
validity
of
the
procedure
by
which
the
death
sentence
was
imposed
on
an
emotionally
disturbed
16-year-old.
justices
brennan
and
o'connor
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
white,
blackmun,
and
rehnquist
have
joined.
