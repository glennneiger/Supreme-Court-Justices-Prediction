unknown
speaker
was
that
the
question,
or
was
the
question
whether
one
who
was
16
years
and
four
months
at
the
time
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
how
old
is
he
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
oklahoma
court
allowed
and
focused
on
youth
as
a
mitigating
factor
here,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
wasn't
the
statement
that
he
couldn't
consider
the
violent
background
of
the
youth?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
what
that
meant.
did
that
mean
the
whole
background,
and
is
that
how
the
court
of
appeals
treated
it?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
true,
if
that
is
what
the
court
meant,
and
then
did
not
consider
it,
i
guess
the
lockett
case
was
decided
shortly
afterwards.
do
we
have
to
then
consider
remanding
on
the
basis
of
having
the
court
consider
these
other
mitigating
circumstances
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
to
do
that,
then
i
guess
we
would
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
age
limit
problem
for
an
execution.
unknown
speaker
lockett
was
decided
in
1978
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
opinion
came
down
in
1980.
why
wasn't
that
raised
in
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals?
unknown
speaker
they
certainly
wrote
language
that
they
thought
complied
with
the
state
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
simply
pulling
over
and
shooting
a
highway
patrolman
who
thinks
he
is
stopping
you
for
a
traffic
stop
with
a
sawed
off
shotgun
is
not
atrocious
and
cruel?
unknown
speaker
wanton
gets
into
the
equation,
does
it
not?
wanton,
mindless
kind
of
action
also
enters
that
equation,
in
the
atrociousness
or
heinousness
of
it.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
torture
suggestion
here.
unknown
speaker
do
you
question
that
it
was
a
mindless,
wanton
act?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
really
focusing
only
on
the
one
issue,
and
that
is
age,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
alternative
solution,
so
far
as
the
state
of
oklahoma
is
concerned?
that
he
be
confined
for
life
under
the
care
of
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
for
15
or
30
years,
as
one
of
them
testified
that
might
enable
them
to
rehabilitate
him?
unknown
speaker
why
should
the
taxpayers
have
to
foot
that
bill?
unknown
speaker
from
the
taxpayers'
point
of
view,
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
more
because
of
the
litigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
cheaper
just
to
shoot
him
when
you
arrested
him,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
am
concerned,
if
we
are
talking
about
setting
a
fixed
age
standard,
with
the
position
that
you
would
then
have
to
take.
for
instance,
an
immature,
impulsive
18-year-old
would
then
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
but
you
would
oppose
it,
i
suppose,
even
for
a
very
sophisticated
or
mature
young
person
under
the
age.
unknown
speaker
you
put
yourself
in
a
very
difficult
position
when
you
fix
an
age
limit
that
is
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
don't
some
20
odd
states
not
require
the
age
of
18,
but
say,
youth
may
be
considered
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
below
that
age,
but
is
not
an
absolute
bar?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
the
test
of
the
evolving
social
mores
that
this
court
has
stated
on
times
for
cruel,
unusual
punishment,
if
you've
got
six
lined
up
against
24,
you
can't
really
say
that
you
have
a
majority
on
your
side,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
that
basis
you
would
say
that
we
should
declare
the
death
penalty
statutes
unconstitutional
in
general.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
applied
to
anybody.
how
many
people
have
been
executed
in
the
last
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
three.
unknown
speaker
one
involuntary.
on
your
basis,
then,
there
should
be
no
death
penalty
statute
sustained.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
going
to
go
by
the
use.
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
the
states
that
permit
the
execution
of
16-year-olds...
i
think
there
are
20
some...
weren't
all
those
laws
recently
enacted,
re-enacted
after
their
in
effect
validation
by--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
and
so
they
have
been
re-enacted.
unknown
speaker
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
are
recent
judgments
of
these
20
some
states.
unknown
speaker
but
justice
white's
question
was,
the
laws
permitting
execution
of
people
under
the
age
of
18,
not
just
simply
remanding
them
to
the
adult
court
system.
unknown
speaker
and
actually,
as
this
case
demonstrates.
unknown
speaker
well,
many
states
allow
an
option
to
the
courts
to
decide
whether
a
juvenile
will
be
prosecuted
as
an
adult
or
under
the
juvenile
system.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
that
is
usually
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
crime
committed,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
isn't
one
of
the
factors
spelled
out
under
oklahoma
law
for
consideration
as
to
whether
to
transfer
them
to
the
adult
court
for
prosecution
the
maturity
of
the
individual?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
client
isn't
a
black.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
do
you
have
standing
to
raise
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
aren't
you
talking
about
the
situation
that
exists
before
proffitt
and
jurek
and
the
1976
cases
that
said,
capital
punishment
was
permissible
under
certain
given
standards?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were
raised,
it
might.
unknown
speaker
the
percentage.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
oklahoma
judge
here
had
a
perfectly...
he
said
that
he
gave
strong
consideration
to
the
youth
as
a
mitigating
factor,
but
that
he
just
couldn't
balance
it
in
favor
of
the
youth
compared
to
all
the
aggravating
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
arguing
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
the
issue
here
is
only
a
mathematical
issue
of
16,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
baker,
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
if
this
boy
were
the
son
of
the
finest
family
in
oklahoma.
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
about
this
alcoholic
mother
and
all?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
position
was
that
under
no
circumstances
ever
did
a
person
who
committed
a
murder
at
the
age
of
16
when
the
act
was
committed
could
suffer
the
capital
punishment.
i
thought
that
is
the
narrow
issue
that
we
had.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
have
a
second
question
in
your
brief
that
whether
or
not
you
prevail
on
your
16-year-old
argument,
that
the
case
should
be
remanded.
unknown
speaker
because
of
what
you
call
a
plain
error.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
case
where
we
have
ever
recognized
what
you
call
a
plain
error
coming
from
a
state
court
that
wasn't
raised
or
litigated
below?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
then
that
the
court
should
under
lockett,
although
the
trial
judge
allowed
all
of
this
testimony
to
come
in,
nonetheless,
re-evaluate
for
itself
whether
or
not
the
mitigating
circumstances
outweighed
the
aggravating
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
proffitt
and
gregg
and
jurek
simply
said
if
the
states
set
up
these
systems
which
were
subject
to
the
safeguards
that
were
incorporated
in
them,
they
were
entitled
to
impose
capital
punishment.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baker,
are
you
talking
now
about
execution
at
the
time
of
execution
or
time
of
the
offense?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
never
submitted
to
congress,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
but
never
ratified.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
they
don't
have
a
constitution
like
ours
that
affirmatively
authorizes
the
death
penalty,
but
places
no
limit
on
it.
unknown
speaker
the
second
question
that
you
have
in
your
brief,
whether
the
court
should
address
the
plain
error--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
find
it
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
is
in
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
consider
the
so-called
march
that
you
have
referred
to
from
furman
to
proffitt
and
jurek
and
gregg
as
a
march
in
the
direction
that
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
it
is
apparent
from
your
argument
that
you
do.
unknown
speaker
would
you
just
simply
prefer
the
unbridled
discretion
that
the
court
found
unconstitutional
in
furman
where
the
jury
just
says
who
lives
and
who
dies?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
lot
of
company.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
proffitt
say
retribution
was
a
proper
motive
for
a
state
to--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
oregon
against
mitchell,
four
members
of
the
court
said
they
didn't
think
that
a
distinction
between
21
and
18
could
survive
an
equal
protection
analysis.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baker,
are
there
any
decisions
around
the
country
that
agree
with
you
on
this
point?
unknown
speaker
no,
decisions.
are
there
any
decisions
you
know
of
that
declare
unconstitutional
a
statute
that
authorizes
capital
punishment
for
a
16-year-old?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
some
that
disagree
with
you
in
several
states.
unknown
speaker
georgia.
louisiana.
unknown
speaker
general
lee,
before
you
get
into
your
argument
too
far,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
about
the
very
first
premise
that
your
opponent
suggested,
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
right
or
not,
but
he
said
something
to
the
effect
that
everybody
would
agree
that
there
is
some
minimum
age
that
you
can't
go
below.
the
question
is,
what
is
that
age?
in
other
words,
would
you
deny
that
there
is
any
minimum
age?
should
you
execute,
say,
a
ten-year-old
or
a
nine-year-old?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
is
there
any
constitutional
barrier,
is
what
the
question
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
hope
we
never
have
to
answer
the
question
as
to
a
nine
or
a
ten-year-old,
but
i
guess
in
england
there
were
times
when
very,
very
young
people
were
executed.
would
you
say
there
is
any
constitutional
limit
on
the
age
of
a
person
that
could
be
executed?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
asking
you
what
the
age
is.
i
am
asking
you
if
you
think
there
is
any
constitutional
limit.
specifically,
say,
would
it
be
constitutional
for
a
state
to
execute
a
ten-year-old
for
committing
this
crime?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
my
question.
if
you
don't
want
to
answer
it,
of
course,
i
can't
force
you
to,
but
do
you
have
a
view
on
a
proper
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
was
the
only
mitigating
circumstance
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
general,
what
about
the
ten-year-old
that
knows
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong?
unknown
speaker
i
just
didn't
want
you
to
get
too
far
off
on
that
road.
you
might
find
trouble.
unknown
speaker
and
all
this
was
before
the
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
the
trial
court...
there
was
no
jury
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it.
the
trial
court
held
that
the
only
mitigating
factor
he
could
consider
was
the
age
of
the
defendant.
he
therefore
did
not
consider
in
determining
that
the
sentence
should
be
death
the
family
background
of
this
16-year-old,
nor
his
extreme
emotional
disorder,
nor
the
other
circumstances
possibly
relevant
to
the
commission
of
the
crime.
is
that
the
general
law
in
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
so
that
any
mitigating
circumstances
could
have
been
considered?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
was
error
not
to
have
considered
those
that
i
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
was
argued.
the
opinion
of
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
acknowledges
that.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
issue
was
not
brought
here,
even
though
it
was
considered
in
the
court
in
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
i
have
trouble
with
no
abuse.
slapping
around
is
not
abuse?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
consider
slapping
around
to
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
consider
slapping
around
to
mean?
abuse
or
not?
unknown
speaker
just
a
little
bit
of
slapping.
unknown
speaker
there
surely
are.
some
of
them
you
kill.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
these
were
isolated
incidences,
or
a
general
pattern
of
behavior
in
that
setting?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
is
it
your
position
then
that
there
is
no
circumstance
in
this
case
that
could
have
constituted
a
mitigating
circumstance
other
than
the
youth?
unknown
speaker
your
state
appellate
court
or
supreme
court
said,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
petitioner
has
a
personality
disorder,
and
you
would
say
under
no
circumstances
could
that
be
a
mitigating
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says,
he
stressed
his
family
history,
in
saying
he
was
suffering
from
severe
psychological
and
emotional
disorders,
and
that
the
killing
was
in
actuality
an
inevitable
product
of
the
way
he
was
raised,
and
then
the
court
says,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
petitioner
has
a
personality
disorder,
then
concluded
that
that
did
not
excuse
the
offense
in
any
way,
but
is
it
your
view
that
could
never
constitute
a
mitigating
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
would
you
argue
also
that
his
lack
of
maturity
should
not
be
considered,
his
lack
of
development,
or
his
lack
of
maturity?
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
just
the
chronological
age
is
a
mitigating
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
was
also
noted
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
make
the
finding
of
maturity,
just
whether
he
knew
right
from
wrong.
unknown
speaker
should
that
in
your
argument
be
the
possible
mitigating
circumstance,
or
just
the
chronological
age?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
asking
whether
that
should
be
one
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
the
court
must
consider.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
mcnaughton
rule.
unknown
speaker
it
is
still
the
mcnaughton
rule.
he
mentioned
it,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
was
guided
by
the
mcnaughton
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
that
determines
it
all.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
anything
else,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
mcnaughton
test.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
i
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
effect,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
all
sociopaths
were
not
to
be
executed,
i
suppose
we
would
be
right
back
to
where
we
were
right
after
furman,
because
people
who
are
well-balanced
and
stable
or
even
approaching
well-balanced
and
stable
don't
take
sawed-off
shotguns
and
shoot
police
officers,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
may
i
ask
you
for
a
clarification
of
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question?
she
asked
you
if
emotional
immaturity
would
be
a
mitigating
factor,
or
the
maturity
of
the
individual,
and
i
think
your
answer
said
no,
provided
he
has
average
mentality
and
lots
of
other
qualifications.
but
supposing
his
mentality
is
that
of
an
average
14-year-old
instead
of
a
16-year-old,
and
his
other
general
indicia
of
development
as
a
mature
person
also
were
characteristic
of
a
14-year-old.
would
that
be
relevant
in
your
view?
i
mean,
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
not
as
an
absolute
bar
to
execution.
unknown
speaker
and
other
factors
that
a
psychiatrist
might
say
determine
maturity
in
general,
if
they
are
also
more
characteristic
of
an
even
younger
person,
would
they
also
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
ability
to
behave
properly
in
a
school
room,
and
the
ability
to
obey
his
parents,
all
sorts
of
things.
i
don't
know
what...
i
mean,
i
am
not
a
psychiatrist,
but
i
suppose
there
are
ways
they
decide
whether
a
man...
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way.
one
of
the
criteria
in
your
statute
for
trial
as
an
adult
is
whether
the
person
has
sufficient
maturity.
what
are
the
characteristics
that
the
judge
uses
to
decide
whether
the
man
is
mature?
unknown
speaker
supposing
those
two
factors
had
cut
in
the
other
direction
against
his
chronological
age?
would
they
not
be
relevant,
in
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
and
in
deciding
on
the
sentence,
i
take
it,
too.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
in
the
sentence
it
should
be
a
more
limited
inquiry
or
a
broader
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
is
there
a
collateral
remedy
in
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
any
barrier
to
his
raising
this
lockett
question
on
state
habeas?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
could
have
raised
it
in
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
but
didn't.
he
did
raise
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
didn't.
he
says
he
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
he
has
exhausted
all
his
remedies
in
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
here
is
what
the
petitioner
says
here.
"this
lockett
error
was
not
enumerated
or
argued
on
appeal
to
the
oklahoma
criminal
court
of
appeals,
nor
was
it
directly
addressed
by
that
court.
"
now,
could
he
raise
it
in
your
post-conviction
procedure?
unknown
speaker
well,
his
reason
is
that
lockett
wasn't
decided.
is
that
a
sufficient
reason
as
a
matter
of
oklahoma
law?
well,
lockett
was
decided
by
the
time--
--by
the
time
of
the
trial?
no,
but
it
was
certainly
decided...
it
was
decided
at
the
time
of
the...
it
had
been
decided
for
two
years
by
the
time--
--on
appeal,
yes.
--it
was
decided
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
unknown
speaker
then
your
answer
is
that
he
could
not
raise
it.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
never
know
until
he
tries.
unknown
speaker
it
will
end
up
on
the
desk
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
as
to
whether
he
could
raise
it
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
very
lenient.
they
let
you
bring
in
things
that
aren't
mentioned
any
place.
so
i
would
assume
that
he
could
have
brought
it
in.
that
is
the
very
reason
i
don't
think
they
will
let
you
bring
it
in
now,
because
he
could
have
brought
it
in
at
the
original
argument.
