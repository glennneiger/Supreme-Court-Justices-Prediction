mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
just
remind
the
court
here
that
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
the
university
has
the
burden
in
this
case
of
justifying
this
regulation,
on
its
face,
the
regulation
restricts
freedom
of
expression
in
what
would
appear
from
the
very
facts
to
be
a
public
forum.
even
if
it
were
not
a
public
form
it
restricts
one
category
of
speech,
appears
to
be
invidious
discrimination
on
speech
and
the
university
has
the
burden
of
establishing
here,
we
do
not
have
the
burden.
they
have
to
justify
their
regulation.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
the
university...
i
think
this
court,
if
that
case
were
to
come
before
it,
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
and
see,
number
one,
if
a
free
exercise
claim
was
asserted,
did
this
constitute
a
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
because
of
the
nature
of
the
campus
or
did
it
inhibit
academic
freedom
of
the
students
and
freedom
to
inquire
because
they
had
no
opportunity
to
have
meetings
or
to
invite
outside
speakers
on
any
subject,
and
the
court
might
well
find
that
such
a
rule
that
completely
forbids
any
special
interest
group
meetings
might
be
unconstitutional
on
those
grounds.
on
the
other
hand,--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--well,
that
is
the
key,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
it
has
to
be
a
compelling
state
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i
think
that
the
establishment
clause
could
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
you
have
a
teacher
in
front
of
a
classroom
who
says,
i
want
to
exercise
my
free
speech
rights,
and
the
principal
says
no,
you
may
have
your
free
speech
rights
but
in
this
case
the
establishment
clause
is
a
compelling
state
interest
that
prohibits
you.
i
think
it
could
be.
in
this
case,
though,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
teacher
speaking;
we
are
talking
about
private
individuals
engaged
in
voluntary
activities
among
themselves.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
that's
his
argument
apparently,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
the
university,
while
desiring
to
avoid
establishment
clause
problems,
marches
straight
into
establishment
clause
problems
by
having
the
primary
effect
of
inhibiting
religion.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
might
not
necessarily
be
making
the
same
argument.
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
that
case.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
okay.
well,
the
case
we're
dealing
with
here--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--it
will
be
basically
the
same
argument
provided--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--provided
they
were
treated
as
any
other
special
interest
group.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
that's
exactly
what
we're
saying,
provided
they
were
treated
like
any
other
special
interest
group.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
well--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--we
don't
deny
there
would
be
some
financial
aid
here,
we
don't
deny
that
at
all.
what
we're
saying--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--there
would
be
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
a
regular
fixed
fee
that
was
applied
equally
across
the
board
to
all
special
interest
groups.
if
they
wish
to
subsidize
the
light
and
heat
and
so
on
that
could
easily
be
done
by
a
fee.
however,
i
think
the
key
is
equal
accommodation.
in
this
case
there
is
a
distinction
between
sponsorship
and
accommodation
that
the
university
seems
to
completely
overlook.
when
a
university
invites
billy
graham
or
someone
on
campus
and
has
him
speak,
then
you've
got
some
sponsorship
involved,
then
you've
got
some
cooperation
and
involvement
of
the
government
in
this
religion.
here,
you
have
the
university
doing
the
exact
opposite.
the
government
is
saying
religion
is
not
required
to
be
on
campus,
even
though
we
must
be
responsive
to
the
non-academic
special
interest
needs
of
these
students.
as
the
university
itself
says
in
its
documents,
nevertheless,
religion
is
not
of
such
a
level
that
we
have
to
allow
students
to
voluntarily
engage
in
religious
activities
on
campus.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
okay.
the
constitutional
provision,
without
reading
it,
provides
there
will
be
no
direct
or
indirect
aid
to
religious
activities.
there's
another
provision
which
says
no
one
shall
be
compelled
to
erect
or
support
any
place
of
worship.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
they
do.
i
do
not
believe
they
can
be
applied
to
this
case.
the
university...
i
mean,
the
missouri
supreme
court
has,
to
my
knowledge,
the
latest
pronouncement
on
that
provision
was
in
1976
in
a
case
in
which
it
allowed
tuition
grants
to
university
students
who
would
then
attend
sectarian
universities
in
missouri.
and
the
court
in
that
case
expressly
followed
the
decision
in
roemer
vs.
board
of
education
of
this
court.
there
are
some
decisions
with
a
lot
of
language
about
strict
separation
of
church
and
state
and
so
on,
but
there's
no
indication
that
the
missouri
constitution
was
ever
intended
to
say
that
people
can't
use
public
property
for
religion
in
the
same
way
they
can
use--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--that's
right,
your
honor,
it's
not
been
decided
in
the
state
of
missouri
that
individuals
cannot
use
public
property
for
religion
the
same
way
they
can
use...
the
same
way
other
groups
can
use
that
public
property.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
there
is
a
missouri
constitutional
provision,
if
i
understand
your
question...
there
is
a
missouri
constitutional
provision
that
grants
freedom
of
speech
to
the
citizens
of
missouri,
the
same
as
the
federal
constitution.
and
of
course,
freedom
of
speech
is
one
constitutional
value
that
weighs
very
heavily
here,
as
well
as
freedom
of
association
and
free
exercise
of
religion.
all
those
values
are
on
this
side.
there
may
be
some
establishment
considerations
on
this
side
of
the
scale.
we're
talking
about
some
incidental
aid
to
religion
from
a
neutral
policy
that
says
special
interest
groups
can
meet
on
campus
and
do
their
own
thing.
self-initiated
activity
is
what
the
university
says
and
what
it
says
it
encourages.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
no
state
is
entitled
to
legislate
away
fundamental
freedoms,
and
particularly
in
the
area
of
religion
and
speech.
these
things
were
placed
beyond
the
whim
of
legislative
majorities.
they
are
not
to
be
dealt
with
by
local
legislators;
they
are
controlled
by
the
constitution.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
it
does
not
imply
approval.
if
it
does,
then
the
university
has
some
difficulties,
because
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
the
university
has
allowed,
while
cornerstone
was
off
campus
the
university
has
allowed
transcendental
meditation,
which
has
been
held
to
be
a
religion
by
the
third
circuit.
they
allowed
sri
jim
noy,
indian
spiritual
master
who
is
an
eastern
mystic.
they
even...
the
university
even
sponsored
a
film
with
this
on
campus.
so
if
it
implies
approval,
then
thereby
their
own
regulation
they're
violating
their
own
regulation
themselves.
secondly,
it
really
doesn't
imply
approval
because
the
university
has
declared
no
sponsorship.
footnote
44
of
our
brief
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
university
says,
we'll
not
allow
our
name
to
be
used
by
any
of
these
groups.
in
other
words,
they
don't
want
cornerstone
going
out
and
saying
we
are
the
university
of
missouri
cornerstone
group
and
we're
doing
such
and
so.
the
university
says,
keep
us
out
of
it;
we
don't
sponsor
them.
if
they
want
to
make
a
bigger
sign
and
put
it
on
top
of
jesse
hall
in
columbia,
missouri,
they
can
do
that.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i
trust
they
would
not
undertake
to
do
that,
and
i
think
that
also
relates
to
the
financial
aid
argument
here.
if
there
is
financial
aid
to
religion
by
this...
by
a
neutral
policy
that
would
allow
religious
groups
on
campus,
then
there
must
be
financial
aid
to
the
young
marxist
group.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whether
they're
regular
or
not.
i
would
assume
that
most
of
the--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--no,
that's
correct.
but
i
think
the
key
here
is
equal
accommodation.
now,
regularity
could
be
a
problem,
as
i
think
mackinnon
noted
in
the
o'hair
case
and
as
the
court
in
the
arizona
university
stadium
case
involving
billy
graham;
regularity
could
be
a
problem.
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts.
does
that
regularity,
when
you
look
at
the
facts,
does
it
connote
sponsorship.
if
it
does
not
because
all
the
other
groups
are
meeting
regularly
and
there's
no
particular
favoritism
involved,
then
you
have
no
sponsorship,
you
have
no
establishment
clause
violation.
if
there's
any
preemption
of
space...
if
cornerstone
would
walk
up
and
say
we
want
a
five-year
lease,
we
want
a
free,
five-year
lease
on
such-and-such
a
room,
and
the
university
says
okay,
we've
got
to
give
it
to
you.
so
cornerstone
has
that
five-year
lease,
and
other
groups
come
along
and
say
hey,
we'd
like
to
use
that
room
once
in
a
while,
too,
you
know,
and
the
university
says
no,
they've
got
it.
then
you
might
have
an
establishment
problem
because
there
would
be
favoritism
toward
religion.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
the
university's
policy,
as
i
understand
it
and
mr.
ayres
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is
that
the
university
allows
non-student
groups
to
come
in
and
use
the
facilities.
i
think
they
generally
charge
for
non-student
groups,
but
i--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i'm
sure
there's
a
regulation
that
makes
it
available,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
regulation,
other
than
the
one
that
says
they
cannot
be
used
for
religious
services
by
any
student
or
non-student
group.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
facts
would
show...
and
mr.
ayres
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
prior
to
the
invocation
of
this
regulation
in
january
1977,
probably
religious
groups
were...
in
fact,
i
know
religious
groups
were
using,
outside
religious
groups
to
some
extent,
were
using
the
facilities
there.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
outside
groups,
apparently
on
a
payment
basis,
on
an
irregular
basis.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
the
university
enacted
this
regulation
in
1972
but
began
enforcing
it
in
january
of
1977,
and
in
this
case
it
is
significant
that
it
was
applied
not
only
to
the
use
of
the
buildings,
but
also,
to
the
use
of
the
grounds
for
a
small
group
bible
study,
as
was
stipulated
in
the
facts
at
the
trial
level
in
the
case.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i
think
that
there
could
well
be
a
distinction
in
a
given
case,
your
honor.
i
think
in
this
case,
the
university
really
exercises
no
more
control
over
its
space
than
a
park
that
has
shelter
houses
and
requires
people
to
call
in
and
reserve
those
shelter
houses
in
advance.
i
think
that's
about
the
degree
of
control
we
have
here.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
this
court
decided
that
in
healy
vs.
james,
the
sds
case,
in
1972
and
made
it
very
clear
in
case
there
was
any
doubt
before
that
the
university
has
no
business
in--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
it
doesn't
a
void
the
establishment
clause
issue
for
us;
we've
still
go
to
get
around
that.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
which
i
believe
we
do.
we
don't
believe
this
is
the
type
of
aid...
if
there's
aid
to
religion
it's
not
the
type
of
aid
that
the
founders
of
our
country,
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
and
the
first
amendment,
intended
to
prohibit.
because
it's
like
a
public
park;
there's
no
money
grant
involved,
no
exchange
of
money.
our
country
has
a
long
history
of
permitting
religious
services
on
public
property
including
university
property.
there's
no
competition
or
entanglement
between
groups
here.
space
can
be
allowed
on
a
first
come/first
served
basis,
and
the
cornerstone
group
or
any
other
religious
group
would
only
be
receiving
the
same
aid
and
assistance
as
any
other
group.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
we
believe
that
that
is
an
additional
factor.
we
believe
that,
on
its
own,
without
the
primary
effect
of
inhibiting
religion,
might
not
be
enough.
but
certainly,
there
is
a
greater
tendency
toward
excessive
entanglement
in
religion
to
have
a
policy--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--i
think
that
my
inability
to
answer
that
very
well
is
an
example
of
the
difficulties
that...
i
would
suspect
it
probably
is
a
religion.
but--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--i
would
suspect
that's
correct.
i
really
have
not
done
research
in
that
area
specifically,
your
honor.
but
certainly,
when
an
administrator
has
to
decide
if
something
is
religious
because
they
say
they
are
such-and-such
a
group;
or
b,
decide
whether
they're...
you
see,
this
regulation
purports
to
allow
business
meetings
but
not
prayer
meetings.
now,
is
the
university
going
to
go
down
and
make
sure
that
nobody
gives
an
opening
prayer
or
that
the
prayer
is
no
longer
than
three
minutes
before
they
start
the
business
meeting?
to
avoid
those
kind
of
dangers,
the
university
would
have
to
monitor
the
meetings,
censor
out
the
conduct--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--if
the
holy
name
society
were
going
to
only
have
a
business
meeting,
then
presumably,
the
university
would
let
them.
but
we're
contending--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--also,
you
have
an
interesting
question,
whether
a
business
meeting
is
not
an
integral
part
of
the
activities
of
the
holy
name
society,
which
would
probably
be
a
pervasively
religious
group,
and
we
get
back
to
some
of
the
lemon
vs.
kurtzman
thinking.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
well,
we
think--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--non-students
may
stand
in
a
little
different
footing
than
students
because--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--non-students
as
a
group
may
stand
on
a
little
different
footing,
but
where
the
university
has
opened
up
a
forum--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--our
answer
is
that
they
must,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i
believe
they
could
probably
exclude
all
off-campus
groups.
presumably,
there
are
a
lot
of
facilities
in
the
community
that
are
available
for
off-campus
groups
to
use.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i
don't
have
any
question
about
that,
maybe
the
court
does.
but
i
think
the
university
would
have
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i
know
there
are
a
number
of
state
universities,
and
the
university
of
missouri
has
an
interesting
arrangement
with
the
missouri
school
of
religion,
which
is
a
separate
entity
but
grants
degrees,
i
believe,
from
the
university
of
missouri.
and
apparently,
public
universities
do
sometimes
award
degrees
in
religious
studies
and
things
of
this
nature.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
fundamental
principles
underlying
the
first
amendment,
the
principles
of
volunteerism,
neutrality,
we
may
find
the
younger
we
get...
for
instance,
in
stein
vs.
oskinsky,
a
case
in
the
briefs
which
was
a
kindergarten
class
where
some
parents
said
we
want
our
kids
to
be
able
to
have
voluntary
prayer
in
the
kindergarten.
and
judge
friendly
said
well,
that,
of
course,
is...
there's
no
such
thing
as
voluntary
anything
in
kindergarten.
and
i
think
when
you
consider
age
in
that
factor
i
don't
know
that
it's
so
easy
as
saying
high
school
is
different
from
college
or
anything.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances.
age
is
one
factor.
and
is
it
self-initiated
activity
and
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
this
court
has
many
times
in
its
aid
to
education
cases
drawn
a
distinction,
particularly
where
the
aid
is
going
to
a
university
which
is
church-related,
and
the
court
has
noticed
that
the
chances
of
that
church-related
institution
using
that
to
indoctrinate
or
impose
its
beliefs
on
students
was
very
limited,
very
small.
we
think
that's
a
little
bit
different
in
this
case
because
here
we're
talking
about
a
meeting
of
students;
we're
not
talking
about
an
authority
structure.
we're
talking
about
a
voluntary
meeting
that
student
interested
can
come
to
if
he
wants
to
but
there's
no
requirement
that
any
student
attend
this
meeting.
it's
not
under
the
exclusive
control
of
any
religious
body.
we
submit
that
a
neutral
policy
would
be
like
the
tax
exemption
in
the
walz
case.
a
longstanding
practice,
the
effect
of
allowing
tax
exemptions
for
religious
as
well
as
other
entities
has
not
been
to
establish
religions.
and
the
opposite,
if
a
state
were
to
deny
tax
exemptions
to
religion
there
might
be
a
risk
of
excessive
entanglement.
there
would
be
a
greater
tendency
for
entanglement.
we
think
those
are
all
factors
that
merit
the
court's
consideration
here.
in
this
case--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
in
our
brief
we've
referred
to
the
fact
that
thomas
jefferson
encouraged
and
allowed
the
sectarian
religious
instruction
on
the
grounds
of
the
university
of
virginia
in
1822,
which
was
when
it
was
opened,
or
shortly
thereafter.
there
are
a
number
of...
well,
i
would
submit
that
almost
every
university
in
this
country
has
allowed
at
one
time
or
another
religious
activities
on
campus.
in
1891,
the
university
of
illinois
upheld
a
provision
where
the
university
actually
sponsored
the
chapel
on
campus.
it
wasn't
a
student
group.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
yes.
that
is
correct,
that
was
before
the
everson
case
which
was
the
first
case
that
really,
apart
from
the
cantwell
case,
applied
the
fourteenth--
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
a
very
good
argument
when
we're
saying
what
is
the
history.
i'm
not
saying
that
what
thomas
jefferson
wanted
to
do
would
be
correct
law
today,
but
i'm
saying
that's
the
history.
and
i'm
saying
we
can
look
at
that
and
see
has
there
been
an
establishment
of
religion,
or
has
there
been
simply
an
aid
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
mr.
james
m.
smart,
jr.
well,
we'd
have
to
look
at
the
exact
facts
of
that.
i
think
that
what
he
did
might
not
be
because
what
he
recommended
was
that
professors
meet
with
these
students
and
teach
these
sectarian
principles
with
them,
and
that
would
seem
to
be
more
of
an
establishment
of
religion
than
we're
asking
for
right
here.
and
i
think
this
court
might
not
allow
us
to
go
that
far.
but
we
think
the
main
problem
with
this
regulation
is
that
it
is
an
invidious
discrimination
against
religion.
a
neutral
policy
has
no
primary
effect
of
doing
anything
except
promoting
inter-communication
between
students.
in
mcdaniel
v.
paty
the
court
struck
down
the
tennessee
requirement
concerning
eligibility
of
ministers
to
hold
public
office,
and
i
note
in
that
case
that
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
held
that
that
provision
violated
the
establishment
clause.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
this
case
is
a
better
case
to
hold
that
the
regulation
in
this
case
violates
the
establishment
clause
than
that
one,
because
of
the
fact
that
religion
is
so
clearly
given
second-class
status,
it
is
stigmatized,
it's
considered
as
not
worthy
of
being
treated
the
same
as
the
other
activities.
it's
a
fallacy
to
say
that
when
you
omit
something
you
say
nothing
about
it.
in
this
case,
the
university
is
propagandizing
and
saying
religion
does
not
need
to
be
allowed
on
the
campus.
we'll
meet
all
the
other
needs
but
we
will
not
meet
a
religious
need
except
maybe
we'll
favor
a
few
certain
religions
that
are
not
traditional
western
religions.
we'll
allow
some
eastern
religions
and
things
like
this,
but
we
will
not
allow--
and
the
state
has
decided
that
religion
is
compartmentalized
and
can
be
off
campus,
and
they
have
regulation
which
is
arbitrary.
it
allows
worship
in
chapel
at
columbia
campus.
no
chapel
at
umpc,
and
i'm
not
sure
why
religion
has
to
be
confined
to
a
chapel
anyway.
it's
over
broad,
it
by
its
terms
would
appear
to
apply
to
a
bull
session
in
a
dormitory
late
at
night
where
three
or
four
people
are
talking
and
one
of
them
maybe
has
been
to
bible
school
before,
so
he
knows
more
and
so
he
begins
to
expound.
it
would
appear
to
apply
to
that.
this
court
has
given
the
highest
degree
of
protection
to
religious
expression
in
the
past
in
cases
like
tucker
vs.
state
of
texas,
murdock
vs.
pennsylvania,
cantwell
vs.
connecticut
and
on
and
on,
and
we
submit
that
the
government
in
this
case
has
no
business
deciding
that
in
a
public
forum
that
religion
is
not
entitled
to
the
same
treatment
as
other
forms
of
expressions,
even
though
it
is
public
property.
we
submit
that
if
the
fact
that
it's
public
property
bothers
the
court
to
some
extent,
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
key
is
equal
accommodation,
no
favoritism
to
religion,
no
sponsorship
of
religion.
just
equal
accommodation.
this
court's
been
very
sensitive
in
the
past
to
government
actions
promoting
religion.
for
instance,
stone
vs.
graham;
so
sensitive,
in
fact,
that
you
reversed
the
decision
of
the
kentucky
court
without
even
hearing
arguments;
you
reversed
it
outright
on
petition
for
cert.
i
submit
that
this
court
also
can
be
just
as
sensitive
to
government
hostility
to
religion
as
it
has
been
for
government
promotion
and
sponsorship
of
religion.
particularly
at
the
university,
which
is
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
and
religion
should
be
allowed
to
find...
to
be
placed
in
its
own
spectrum
by
the
marketplace
in
which
it
exists.
the
students
will
put
it
where
it
needs
to
be.
thank
you,
your
honor.
