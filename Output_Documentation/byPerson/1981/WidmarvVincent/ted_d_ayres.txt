mr.
ted
d.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
the
court
knows,
the
case
at
bar
presents
issues
which
revolve
around
the
religion
clause
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
re-occurring
question
of
its
proper
relationship
with
public
education.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
it's
our
contention
that
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
an
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
hopefully,
we
will
show
in
our
argument
to
come
that
the
free
speech
clause,
the
press
and
the
assembly
clause
which
were
used
by
the
eighth
circuit
were
not
properly
used,
and
that
the
case
should
center
around
the
religion
clauses.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
yes,
your
honor,
that's
no
problem.
we're
dealing
in
this
case
with
a
tax-supported
state
institution
of
higher
education.
generally,
the
question
can
be
summarized
or
posed
as
follows:
can
or
must
a
tax-supported
state
university
permit
regular
religious
worship
services
on
its
premises
by
a
recognized
student
group?
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
members
of
a
group
or
organization
called
cornerstone.
cornerstone
is
and
was
a
recognized
student
group
of
the
university
of
missouri,
kansas
city.
in
january
of
1977,
respondents
sought
to
obtain
the
usage
of
a
campus
building
for
meetings
on
every
saturday
night
for
two
and
a
half
hours
for
the
following
winter
semester,
which
ran
from
january
to
may.
upon
further
inquiry
by
university
officials,
information
was
provided
that
indicated
that
respondents
fully
intended
to
conduct
regular
religious
worship
services
in
the
meeting
rooms
that
were
sought.
the
university
was
advised
that
a
typical--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--justice
blackmun,
the
dates
sought
which
led
to
this
case
were
from
january
through
may
of
1977.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
your
honor,
the
facts
that
were
stipulated
at
the
trial
indicated
that
the
cornerstone
group
had
met
in
university
facilities
prior
to
this
time.
however,
it
was
also
stipulated
that
neither
the
chancellor
nor
the
dean
of
students
was
ever
aware
that
the
cornerstone
group
was
using
the
facilities
for
actual
religious
worship
services.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
up
to
this
point
in
time,
justice
blackmun,
to
my
knowledge,
the
only
usage
that
the
respondents
made
of
university
facilities
was
indeed
indoors.
the
university
was
advised
that
the
typical
cornerstone
meeting
that
was
sought
would
include
the
following
elements.
the
offering
of
prayer,
the
singing
of
hymns
in
praise
and
thanksgiving,
the
public
reading
of
scripture,
the
sharing
of
personal
views
and
experiences
in
relation
to
god
by
various
persons,
an
exposition
of
and
commentary
on
passages
of
the
bible
by
one
or
more
persons
for
the
purposes
of
teaching
practical
biblical
principles,
and
an
invitation
to
the
interested
to
meet
for
personal
discussions.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
that
is
true,
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
would
submit
in
response
to
that
question...
and
it's
petitioners'
position...
that
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
with
regard
to
that
incident
as
there
is
with
regard
to
religious
worship.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
assume
that
unless
the
meetings
were
such
to
advocate
the
immediate
overthrow
of
the
government
and
were
such
that
would
lead
to
imminent
action,
it's
my
belief
that
those
such
meetings
would
be
permitted
on
campus.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
rehnquist,
let
me
make
it
clear
from
the
beginning
that
religious
groups...
in
this
case
at
the
university
of
missouri,
kansas
city...
has
ten
student
groups
that
are
recognized,
official
student
groups,
which
could
be
said
to
have
some
sort
of
a
religious
affiliation.
there
is
no
general
prohibition
against
their
meeting
on
campus.
they
are
free
to
use
the
meeting
rooms
and
facilities
of
the
university.
official
student
recognition
also
holds
with
it
the
possibility
of
funds
to
help
support
or
fund
a
speaker
or
a
meeting.
they're
equally
entitled
to
those
benefits,
as
all
other
officially
recognized
student
groups
are,
except
to
the
extent
of
religious
worship
or
religious
teaching.
and
it
is
the
position
of
petitioners
that
those
sort
of
activities
are
prohibited
not
only
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
but
missouri's
constitution.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
we
need
to
keep
the
case
centered
around
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
it
appears
to
me,
and
it
is
petitioners'
argument,
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
there
is
no
question,
and
it's
undisputed
in
the
record...
it
was
so
found
by
the
trial
court
and
it's
admitted
by
the
respondents...
that
they
seek
to
use
university
facilities
for
religious
worship
services
on
a
regular
basis.
i
would
submit
that
as
long
as
the
meetings
which
they
wish
to
seek
are
with
regard
to
speakers,
a
meeting
of
the
group
for
business
purposes,
that
sort
of
thing,
that
is
not
within
the
purview
of
the
constitution
of
prohibition.
but
it
is
the
position
of
petitioners
in
this
case
that
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
the
university
left
us
with
no
choice
but
to
prohibit
the
regular
religious
worship
services
that
were
sought.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
without
further
clarification
from
this
court
and
based
upon
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
i
would
say
the
fact
that...
if
mr.
falwell
comes
in
on
a
regular
basis,
let's
say
a
monthly
basis,
depending
upon
the
content
of
his
presentation
or
his
speech,
in
my
mind
there
would
be
serious
constitutional
questions
about
allowing
him
to
come
in
on
a
regular
basis.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
although
that
individual
might
be
considered
by
some
to
be
controversial,
i
do
not
see
that
touching
on
the
religious
aspect,
again,
there's
no
intent
to
restrict
the
freedom
of
speech
of
the
students
or
anyone
else
properly
on
the
campus.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
campus
may
be
used
for
religious
worship
services.
i
do
not
think
that
your
example
with
regard
to
mr.
kuntzler
would
fall
into
that
category.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
rehnquist,
again,
and
relying
on
prior
decisions
of
the
court,
this
court
has
said
in
the
schempp
case
and
others
that
the
bible
is
clearly
an
instrument
of
religion.
but
the
university
would
not
contend
or
not
argue
that
the
bible
may
not...
or
may
also
be
considered
a
work
of
literature
and
may
be
studied
for
those
purposes.
if
someone
were
to
read
the
bible
on
campus
individually
as
a
part
of
their
study,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
regulation
does
not
address
that.
but
to
say
that
to
read
the
bible
in
the
context
of
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case,
to
me
stretches
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
assembly,
stretches
it
way
too
far.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
based
on
that
hypothetical,
justice
rehnquist,
it
would
be
my
assumption
that
such
activity
would
not
be
prohibited
under
this
regulation,
or
it
does
not
fall
within
the
facts
of
the
case
now
before
the
court.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
aware
of
this
court's
opinion
in
mosley
and
others,
which
indicates
that
content-related
restriction
is
violative
of
constitutional
law.
and
i
guess
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
are
before
this
court;
is
whether
or
not
that
prohibition
carries
over
into
the
religious
area.
my
argument
would
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
such
an
argument
is
allowed
to
prevail,
in
other
words,
if
someone
could
come
in
and
say,
i
am
here
to
speak
about
religion,
or,
i
am
here
to
assemble
about
religion,
and
that
is
a
convenient
excuse
to
allow
religious
worship
services,
then
it
is
my
contention
that
that
makes
a
complete
nullity
of
the
establishment
clause.
i
do
not
think
it's
that
easy,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
allow
that
to...
allow
the
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
assembly
clauses
to
come
in
in
a
case
of
this
nature.
it
just
goes
too
far,
and
i
realize
that
that
presents
some
tough
or
difficult
questions,
but
looking
at
the
history
of
the
establishment
clause
and
what
this
court
has
said
it
means
beginning
in
1947
with
justice
black's
famous
opinion
in
the
everson
case,
i
just...
my
opinion
would
be
that
if
the
court
holds
that
activities
such
as
these
are
permitted
because
of
the
speech
clause
or
the
assembly
clause,
the
court
will
be
making
a
drastic
retrenchment
from
its
prior
cases.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
i
do
not
think
those
cases
are
applicable
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
obviously,
the
immediate
distinction
is...
and
which
the
court
has
made
many
times
itself...
is
that
the
benefits
provided
in
those
cases,
for
instance,
the
bus
transportation
case
and
the
textbook
cases,
was
an
indirect
aid
and
went
primarily
to
the
students
involved
and
not
to
the
parochial
or
private
school
which
was
involved.
it's
my
opinion
that
in
this
case
it
can
be
distinguished
because
here
we
have
direct
assistance
that
will
serve
to
have
the
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion.
i
draw
the
distinction
that
it
is
a
more
direct
benefit
that
is
being
provided
than
in
the
cases
which
mr.
chief
justice
has
discussed.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
stevens,
i
would
address
that
question
by
the
fact
that
this
court
has
spoken
often
of
the
fact
that
if
an
individual
is
deprived
of
religious
worship
opportunities
by
something
that
the
government
has
done;
i.e.,
a
soldier
in
the
field,
a
prisoner--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--a
prisoner
in
prison...
let
me
address
your
question.
i
think
the
court
has
often
held
that
that
would
be
hostile
to
religion
to
not
permit
the
opportunity
for
those
individuals
to
worship
just
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
their
other
already-immediate
access
to
such
services.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
to
answer
your
question
about
annapolis,
i
would
submit,
justice
stevens,
that
the
military
academies,
including
annapolis,
are
special
institutions,
provided
to
train
our
military
officers.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
required
chapel
at
those
institutions
are
part
of
the
training
which
go
into--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--that's
correct.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
no.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
powell,
that
is
a
question
that
will
be
before
the
court.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
only
question
before
it,
based
upon
the
pleadings,
was
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
could
be
permitted
in
a
university
building.
the
eighth
circuit
went
and
said
that
they
could
address
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
worship
services
on
the
grounds
were
also
emanating
out
of
this
complaint.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
and
to
justice
powell
that
the
regulation
involved
on
its
face
and
in
its
own
language
is
applicable
to
buildings
and
grounds,
and
i
think
for--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--right.
and
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they
are
questions
that
need
to
be
answered.
we
have
obviously
argued
in
our
brief
why
that
distinction
is
not
important
as
far
as--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--justice
powell,
the
university
of
missouri
is
a
constitutionally-established
institution.
it
is
one
university
with
four
campuses.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
this
campus
which
this
case
arose
out
of
is
located
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
powell,
it's
not
clear
to
me
from
the
cases...
i
don't
know
that
that
question
has
ever
been
directly
answered.
i
would
say
that
depending
upon
the
prior
usage
of
such
park
and
depending
upon
its
openness
for
events
other
than
religious
worship
services,--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--justice
powell,
it
would
be
my
opinion,
responding
to
your
question,
that
if
it
was...
if
the
group
involved
was
seeking
to
hold
religious
worship
services
in
the
park
on
a
regular
basis,
to
the
extent
they
were
sought
in
this
case,
it
is
my
opinion
that
kansas
city,
based
upon
establishment
grounds,
could
prohibit
such
meetings.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
have
tried
to
address
those
points
in
our
brief.
i
think
that
the
national
mall
where
both
of
the
activities
which
you
referred
to
would
take
place
has
gone
beyond
and
cannot
be
fairly
compared
to
the
campus
of
a
state
university.
it
is
obvious
that
the
national
mall
is
used
for
matters,
national
matters
of
every
spectrum,
and
to
compare
that
to
the
campus
in
this
case
is
not
a
fair
one.
i
would
also
submit
with
regard
to
the
pope's
visit,
which
i
think
the
mere
special
occasion
had
a
lot
to
do
with
the
decision,
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
judge
mackinnon
noted
the
issue
in
his
concurring
opinion
where
he
said
that
to
allow
these
on
a
irregular
basis
does
not
present
a
problem.
but
if
it
was
sought
to
hold
religious
worship
services
even
on
the
national
mall
on
a
regular
recurring
basis,
such
would
present
establishment
clause
problems.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
brennan,--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--i
think
those
questions
have
been
answered
to
some
extent
by
the
fact
that
the
christmas
tree,
and
again
to
some
extent
the
creche,
have
gone
beyond
the
religious
significance.
that
christmas
has
become,
in
effect,
a
national
holiday,
a
holiday
which
is
equally
meaningful
to
all
of
us,
no
matter
what
our
religious
affiliation
is,
and
so
i
think
those
cases
are
not
pertinent,
either.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
blackmun,
when
you
say
prayer
breakfast,
i
guess
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you
mean--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--to
being
the
meeting,
justice
blackmun?
or
is
it...
let
me
respond
to
your
question,
if
i
may--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--to
respond
to
your
question
the
best
way
that
i
may,
i
think
that
there
are
many
decisions
which
indicate
that
prayer
or
an
acknowledgement
of
god
before
a
public
meeting
are
suitable
in
that
they
serve
to
set
the
tone,
get
the
meeting
started
out
in
a
properly
appropriate
manner,
and
i
would
submit
that
this
situation
falls
into
that
category.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
i
think
that's
right,
justice
brennan.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
well,
let
me
say,
justice
stevens,
that
again
in
the
context
of
this
case,
a
one-time
meeting
was
not
sought.
it
was
clear
that
they
sought
a
regular
weekly
meeting
place
for
their
services.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
if
it
was
known
that
the
meeting
was
a
religious
worship--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
argue
that
it
is,
it
is
indeed.
again,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
ceremony
to
begin
this
auspicious
occasion,
to
get
a
proper
frame
of
reference
of
mind
for
all
those
involved.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
ten
commandments
stand
above
on
the
building.
i
think
there's
a
secular
purpose
for
that
because
the
other
famous
historical
origins
of
long
are
also
presented.
but
i
would
remind
the
court
of
its
opinion
in
stone,
that
the
ten
commandments
could
not
be
posted
in
elementary
or
secondary
schools.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
i've
tried
to
answer
questions,
justice
white.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
yes,
sir.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
that's
true,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
your
honor,
it's
certainly
not
my
intent
to
get
them
down.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
no,
your
honor.
the
university
of
missouri,
our
office
of
general
counsel
is
handling
the
case
itself,
and
the
attorney
general's
office
is
not
involved
as
an
amicus
or
any
other
way.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
no,
sir.
we
would
argue
that
our
viewpoint
is
upheld
by
several
attorney
general
opinions,
your
honor,
but
we
do
not
presume
to
be
here
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
that's
right.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
in
our
opinion
it
is,
justice
blackmun.
let
me
just
indicate
a
couple
of
things
before
i
sit
down.
as
justice
white
has
indicated,
we
believe
that
there
are
other
grounds
upon
which
we
can
win
this
case;
primarily,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
indication
that
the
free
exercise
rights
of
the
students
involved
in
this
case
nave
been
infringed.
this
was
a
specific
finding
of
the
trial
court,
and
i
believe
that
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
record
there
is
no
indication
that
these
students
have
an
absolute
cardinal
precept
of
their
religion
that
they
must
worship
on
university
premises.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
would
you
repeat
your
question,
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
some
of
the
cases
of
this
court,
justice
rehnquist,
have
indicated
that
because
a
right
is
available
somewhere
else,
you
cannot
foreclose
that
right
at
another
place.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
fact
situation
was
not
applicable
here
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
it
was
clearly
a
religious
worship
service
that
was
sought,
and
so
it
would
not
be
applicable
to
this
case.
i
am
going
to
sit
down
at
this
time
to
allow
me
some
rebuttal.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
i
would
like
to
say
first
of
all
that
with
regard
to
thomas
jefferson,
i
might
point
out
for
the
court
if
it's
interested
in
history
that
when
thomas
jefferson
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
visitors
at
william
and
mary
when
it
was
a
state
institution
in
1779,
thomas
jefferson
was
instrumental
in
having
religious
instruction
outlawed
at
william
and
mary.
i
would
also
point
out
that
what
occurred
at
the
university
of
virginia--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
is
fair,
that
the
compelling
interest
not
only
of
the
united
states
constitution
establishment
clause
but
the
missouri
strong
interest
in
avoiding--
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
--to
some
extent.
in
line
with
what
justice
rehnquist
was
going
to,
i
certainly
would
not
argue
to
the
court
that
missouri
could
constitutionally
violate
or
infringe
upon
freedoms
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
but
i
think
it
goes
along
and
strengthens
our
argument.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
yes.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
exactly.
it's
not
an
invented
thing.
i
might
also
point
out
that
with
regard
to
the
chapel
that
was
mentioned
at
the
university
of
missouri
at
columbia,
it
was
built
entirely
with
private
funds
and
is
not
a
situation
where
regular
religious
worship
occurs.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
your
honor,
i
would
submit,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
regulation
has
been
in
effect
since
1972.
it
was
only
in
1977
that
an
occurrence
occurred
where
it
needed
to
be
enforced.
as
the
record
shows,
the
university
had
no
knowledge
that
any
meetings
were
taking
place
or
occurring
that
had
elements
of
worship
in
it.
mr.
ted
d.
ayres
i
would
submit
in
its
particular
form
it's
been
around
since
1972.
i
think
some
form
of
the
regulation
has
been
on
the
books
prior
to
that.
