unknown
speaker
just
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
first
amendment
itself,
apart
from
the
religion
clauses?
unknown
speaker
you
concede,
i
take
it,
for
purposes
of
argument
that
the
entire
first
amendment
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
states
as
to
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
would
you
give
me
the
dates
for
which
they
sought.
unknown
speaker
and
prior
to
that
time,
had
the
group
met
on
campus?
unknown
speaker
by
facilities
you
mean
indoors
or
outside?
unknown
speaker
the
university
system
in
missouri
has
recognized
the
right
of
a
gay
rights
unit,
as
i
understand
to
meet
on
the
campus
and
hold
discussions
and
exchange
views,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
young
marxists
league,
if
they
had
one
on
the
campus,
would
they
be
permitted
to
meet
to
make
attacks
on
the
democratic
system
of
government
and
express
their
views?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
only
religious
groups
that
may
properly
be
forbidden
to
meet
on
campus,
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
elaborate
on
the
distinction
you
make
between
the
ten
religious
groups
which
are
recognized
to
meet
and
religious
worship
or
services?
unknown
speaker
could
they
sign
up
jerry
falwell
for
once
a
month
for
a
regular
appearance
on
the
campus?
unknown
speaker
how
about
someone
like
william
kuntzler
or
someone
who
had
defended
one
of
the
groups
in
the
late
sixties?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
reading
from
the
bible
a
form
of
freedom
of
speech?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
program
consisted
of
a
reading
of,
say,
four
chapters
of
one
of
the
gospels,
followed
by
a
student
discussion
of
the
content
of
those
chapter
and
criticism
and
exchange
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
in
one
of
the
hypotheticals
presented
you
said
it
would
depend
upon
the
content
of
what
the
speaker
said.
do
you
not
run
afoul
the
free
speech
provisions
of
the
first
amendment,
entirely
apart
from
the
religion
clauses,
if
you
censor
on
the
basis
of
content?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
what
the
court
has
said
was
appropriate
in
terms
of
providing
books
to
parochial
schools
and
transportation
to
and
from
parochial
schools,
and
that
is
certainly...
the
arguments
were
made
that
that
was
an
aid
of
sorts
to
religion
and
also
tax
exemption.
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--what
do
you
do
with
the
provision
of
religious
services
in
the
military
and
the
navy
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
church
at
annapolis?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
campus
is
out
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
voluntary,
i
assume.
attendance
is
voluntary,
as
it
is
in
this...
i
take
it
here,
also,
the
student
participation
is
entirely
voluntary.
unknown
speaker
and
the
university
doesn't
either
favor
or
disfavor
the
group.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres,
the
university
draws
no
distinction
between
religious
services
in
buildings
and
on
its
grounds,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
your
petition
covers
both.
unknown
speaker
may
i
follow
up
with
this
question.
is
the
university
located
in
columbia
or
independence
or
where?
st.
louis?
unknown
speaker
where
is
this
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
a
religious
service
could
be
banned
in
a
public
park
in
kansas
city?
or,
as
someone
suggested,
the
reverend
falwell
from
speaking
there?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
it's
exactly
like
the
student
building
involved
here;
it's
open
for
all
other
groups,
as
your
answers
to
other
questions
have
indicated.
could
the
city
foreclose
use
for
religious
purposes
of
a
public
park
of
that
character?
unknown
speaker
what
about
services
which
begin
at
the
lincoln
memorial
sometimes
with
prayers
and
hymns
being
sung,
and
then
even
more
specifically
a
religious
service,
the
mass
held
on
the
mall
when
pope
john
paul
ii
was
here
several
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
christmas
tree
on
the
mall
every
christmas?
unknown
speaker
and
the
creche.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres,
does
it
disturb
you
that
members
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
prayer
breakfasts
in
the
national
capitol
building
on
a
regular
basis?
unknown
speaker
at
which
scripture
is
read,
prayers
are
offered,
papers
are
given.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
chaplain
daily
gives
prayers
in
each
house.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ayres,
i
gather
some
of
us
at
least
have
thought
that
in
god
we
trust
above
the
speaker's
bench
and
the
prayer
breakfasts
and
other
exercises
of
that
kind
fall
into
the
category
of
political
questions,
not
judicially
reviewable
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres,
you
suggested
with
respect
to
the
mass
on
the
mall
that
the
distinction
is
between
a
regular
recurring
event,
as
was
involved
here,
and
an
incidental
or
irregular
event.
but
as
i
understand
your
regulation,
you
wouldn't
permit
these
people
to
meet
even
once.
unknown
speaker
so
i
really
don't
think
that's
a
valid
distinction
for
purposes
of
defending
your
own
regulation.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
your
regulation
would
prohibit
a
one-time
meeting,
if
i
understand
the
record
correctly.
unknown
speaker
if
people
did
give
you
advance
notice
of
exactly
what
they
intended
to
do,
which
would
seem
to
be
appropriate.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres,
i
assume
you
were
at
10:00
o'clock
this
morning
when
the
marshal
of
the
court
in
announcing
the
court
pronounced,
in
effect,
a
very
short
benediction
when
he
said
god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.
is
that
any
different
from
a
ten-minute
prayer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres,
i
suggest
to
you
that
you...
i
don't
know
whether
you'll
win
this
case
or
not,
but
i
would
think
you
could
win
it
without
having
to
claim
that
if
the
university
allowed
these
meetings
that
it
would
be
an
establishment.
your
question
is
whether
they
are
permitted,
rather
than
required,
to
ban
these
meetings.
i
mean,
it
could
be
that
the
university
could
do
it
either
way;
they
could
allow
them
or
not
allow
them,
without
violating
any
part
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
i
would
think
all
you
have
to
do
is
argue
that
it's
permissible
for
the
university
to
stay
as
far...
not
as
far
away
from
religion
as
it
wants
to,
but
at
least
this
far,
that
it
could
take
pains
to
avoid
any
problems
like
this,
and
you
wouldn't
need
to
prove
or
admit
or
claim
that
if
they
were
permitted
it
would
be
an
establishment.
justice
white,
i
can
only
wholeheartedly
agree,
and
this
is
the--
--i
know,
but
you've
been
arguing
all
the
time
that--
--but
you
haven't
had
any
chance
to
argue.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
exactly.
0
[generallaughter.]
and
i
take
it
that
congress
could
cease
having
prayers
every
day
or
we
could
probably
cut
out
the
last
part
of
the...
cut
the
benediction
out
of
this
without
violating
the
religious
clauses
or
the
free
speech
clauses,
either.
mr.
ayres,
another
thing,
when
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
argued
the
evidence
in
the
case
he
said
that
if
we
ruled
against
him,
we
would
have
to
rip
down
these
ten
commandments
up
here.
and
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
quote,
"i
think
we
can
do
it
without
that.
"
and
he
did,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
why
argue
about
these
ten
commandments.
they're
still
up
there.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
get
them
down,
so
i
don't
see
how
you're
going
to
get
them
down.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres,
is
the
attorney
general
of
missouri
in
this
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
office
of
the
general
counsel
representing
the
views
of
the
attorney
general
of
missouri?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
here...
the
university
is
constitutionally
organized
and
the
attorney
general
is
not
the
lawyer
for
the
university.
unknown
speaker
and
insofar
as
the
state
of
missouri
is
concerned,
with
respect
to
the
university
you
are
the
attorney
general.
unknown
speaker
is
that
clear
as
crystal?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
a
familiar
statement
from
any
of
our
cases
that
just
because
the
state
allows
you
to
exercise
rights
of
free
speech
in
some
other
place,
then
you
want
to
exercise
them,
is
not
a
defense
to
its
refusal
to
allow
you
to
exercise
them
where
you
do
want
to
exercise
them?
unknown
speaker
yes.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
enough
under
our
cases
under
the
freedom
of
speech
clause,
i
take
it,
to
say
that
you
can
go
down
to
the
marina
every
morning
and
have
a
parade
if
you
want
to,
when
the
mall
is
available
and
has
been
used
for
freedom
of
speech
demonstrations
of
all
sorts.
unknown
speaker
could
the
university
preclude
the
use
of
those
meeting
room
for
all
purposes
if
it
wanted
to,
except
classes
of
the
university?
unknown
speaker
even
if
justified,
mr.
smart,
by
a
compelling
state
interest?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
has
to
be
a
compelling
state
interest,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
did
i
correctly
understand
one
of
mr.
ayres'
arguments
to
be
that
the
compelling
state
interest
in
this
instance
was
the
desire
to
avoid
any
of
the
complications
that
might
lead
to
the
establishment
of
a
religion?
would
you
regard
that
as
a
compelling
state
interest?
unknown
speaker
even
so,
i
gather,
if
i
understand
mr.
ayres
argument,
it
is
that...
i
know,
but
to
permit
this
sort
of
thing
is
to
expose
the
university
to
possible
problems
under
the
establishment
clause
of
our
being
accused
of
favoring
religion
and
therefore
violating
the
establishment
clause.
and
our
compelling
state
interest
is
to
avoid
that
possibility.
wasn't
that
his
argument?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
suppose
a
group
of
students
organize
a
denomination
of
a
particular
religion
on
the
campus,
and
they
say
well,
we
have
to
have
someplace
regularly
to
meet
like
others.
and
they
have
a
minister
who
will
come
and
preach
to
them
at
these
meetings,
and
they
want
the
university
to
let
them
use,
say,
one
of
its
buildings
as
their
church.
and
they
frankly
say,
we
can't
afford
a
church
but
if
we
had
a
church,
we
would
meet
in
it,
but
we
don't,
and
we
want
to
use
your
building
as
a
church.
now,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
or
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know
all
the
facts
right
now.
unknown
speaker
no,
just
answer
my
question.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
university
would
be
required
to
let
them
hold
regular
church
services,
use
their
building
as
a
church.
that's
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
but
your
argument
would
say
that
the
university
would
be
required
to
use
their
building
as
a
church.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
university,
as
justice
brennan
suggests
your
colleague
is
arguing,
the
university
doesn't
want
to
get
that
close
to
religion,
and
it
wants
to
stay
more
neutral,
and
it
doesn't
want
to
have
its
facilities...
the
university
would
be
paying
the
light,
the
heat,
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
no
one
charges
enough
to
student
groups
to
pay
depreciation
or
anything.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
anything
to
interfere
with
the
university
saying
that
there
would
a
fixed
fee
for
the
use
of
the
room
by
any
group
including
this
church
group
that
is
hypothesized?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
smart,
there
is
a
rather
rigid
missouri
constitutional
provision,
is
there
not,
dealing
with--
unknown
speaker
--precisely
what
does
that
provide?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
those
provisions
add
anything
to
the
federal
constitutional
argument
that
mr.
ayres
has
been
making?
do
they
help
him
any?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
i
gather
the
issue
we
have
here
has
not
been
raised
before
the
missouri
state
court
under--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
missouri
constitution
contained
a
clause
saying
that
there
shall
be
no
requirement
of
freedom
of
speech
or
that
the
state
shall
allow
freedom
of
speech
in
its
state
and
it
shall
regulate
it
as
it
sees
fit.
would
you
think
that
that
would
be
a
compelling
state
interest
for
defense
against
a
claim
that
the
federal
first
amendment
was
being
violated?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
a
state
had
a
constitutional
provision
diametrically
opposite
to
the
first
amendment
that
said
the
state
shall
be
able
to
freely
regulate
discussion
of
public
topics?
would
you
think
that
was
a
compelling
state
interest
if
the
state
were
charged
with
violating
the
federal
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
since
1925.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smart,
you
have
argued,
i
believe,
that
by
not
permitting
the
group
to
meet
on
campus
for
its
services,
that
some
stigma
attached
in
the
minds
of
the
students
by
virtue
of
that.
would
the
reverse
be
true,
and
by
allowing
the
group
to
hold
its
sessions
on
campus
does
that
imply
some
kind
of
sponsorship
or
approval
by
the
university?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres
has
conceded
that
the
young
communists
league
or
the
marxist
society
could
meet,
and
surely,
the
university
wouldn't
undertake
to
sponsor
or
endorse
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ayres
says
that
these
are
spot
times
and
it's
not
regular.
unknown
speaker
but
that
man
from
india
didn't
come
over
here
a
very
week,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smart,
does
the
university
have
a
specific
regulation
with
respect
to
non-campus
groups;
those
that
may
come
in
casually?
unknown
speaker
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
any
specific
regulation?
unknown
speaker
is
it
conceded
in
this
case,
or
does
the
record
show
that
no
outside
religious
group
would
be
allowed
to
hold
any
sort
of
meeting
on
the
campus?
unknown
speaker
outside
groups.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
university
decided
to
change
its
policy.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
a
university
has
more
control
over
the
use
of
its
campus
than
a
city
does
over
a
public
square,
provided
the
control
is
exercised
uniformly?
unknown
speaker
but
whatever
the
degree
of
control,
counsel,
could
the
university
discriminate
as
between
and
among
groups
on
the
basis
of
the
content
of
what
took
place
in
the
meeting?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
healy
we
didn't
have
any
implication
of
the
religion
clauses.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
this
is
a
different
issue,
isn't
it,
than
we
had
in
healy?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
too,
mr.
smart,
in
applying
this
regulation
somebody
in
the
university
has
to
make
a
judgment
whether
a
given
group
is
a
religious
group,
does
it
not?
i
mean,
krishna,
all
the
several
different
kinds
of
groups.
unknown
speaker
does
that
implicate
some
establishment
problems,
too?
i
mean
the
very
regulation.
unknown
speaker
is
scientology
a
religion,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
some
courts
have
held
that
it
is
not,
but
there's
no
uniformity.
isn't
that
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
for
example,
a
roman
catholic
church
couldn't
have
a
mass
under
this
regulation,
but
what
about
the
holy
name
society
having
a
meeting?
unknown
speaker
but
the
university
would
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
a
religious
meeting
or
not,
i
take
it,
to
apply
this
regulation.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
university
rents
its
facilities
to
off-campus
groups
for
a
fee,
your
position
would
be,
i
take
it,
that
if
the
catholic
church
wanted
to
rent
one
of
its
buildings
on
a
regular
basis
to
hold
its
church
services,
that
the
university
would
have
to
rent
it.
unknown
speaker
i've
asked
you
this
question
before,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
university
could
rent
to
some
outside
organizations
but
refuse
to
rent
a
building
to
the
catholic
church?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
they
must
rent
the
building
to
the
catholic
church.
unknown
speaker
but
they
could
exclude
all
off-campus
groups,
could
they
not?
unknown
speaker
could
there
be
any
question
that
the
university
could
say
that
the
facilities
are
limited
to
student
body
groups?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
that
the
university
could
give
an
advanced
degree
in
one
or
more
religions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smart,
do
you
see
any
differences
between
the
circumstances
here
involving
a
university
and
the
use
of
its
premises
as
opposed
to
that
of
a
high
school
or
a
grammar
school?
unknown
speaker
has
this
court
made
a
distinction
between
universities
and
high
schools
and
grade
schools
already?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
anything
comparable
to
the
tax
exemption
history
in
the
way
of
a
custom
of
allowing
religious
meetings--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
smart,
when
thomas
jefferson
conducted
the
activity
at
the
university
of
virginia,
wasn't
that
before
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
been
used
to
apply
the
first
amendment
freedoms
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
not
really
a
very
good
argument,
is
it,
for
your--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
you
were
saying
that
what
thomas
jefferson
did
is
the
law
today.
unknown
speaker
well,
religious
instruction
might
be
a
little
different
from
allowing
a
religious
meeting.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question.
i
gather,
do
i
not,
that
your
principal
argument
is
that
the
compelling
state
interest
that
justifies
this
regulation
is
a
desire
to
avoid
the
problems
that
otherwise
might
arise
from
establishment.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
missouri
constitutional
provision
help
your
federal
first
amendment
argument
at
all?
unknown
speaker
on
compelling
state
interest?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
helps
you
in
saying
that
at
least
the
interest
is
bona
fide.
it's
not
a
recent
dream.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
understood
this
regulation
was
enforced
only
from
1977.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
of
ancient
vintage,
then.
