justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
it
involves
the
validity
of
a
regulation
at
the
university
of
missouri
at
kansas
city.
the
university
provides
facilities
for
all
student
groups
that
wish
to
meet
on
its
campus.
more
than
a
hundred
such
groups,
including
a
religious
group,
called
cornerstone,
were
officially
recognized
by
the
university.
the
cornerstone
group
was
informed
that
it
could
no
longer
meet
in
university
buildings.
the
exclusion
was
based
on
a
regulation
that
prohibited
the
use
of
its
buildings
or
grounds
for
purposes
of
religious
worship
or
religious
teaching.
this
suit
was
instituted
by
members
of
the
cornerstone
group.
they
allege
a
violation
of
their
rights
to
free
exercise
of
religion
and
freedom
of
speech
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
the
university
defended
on
the
ground
that
use
of
its
facilities
for
religious
worship
or
discussion
would
offend
the
establishment
clause
of
the
constitution
as
well
as
the
missouri
constitution.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
agreeing
with
the
university's
position.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
in
our
opinion
today,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
religious
worship
and
discussion
are
forms
of
speech
and
association
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
a
state
university's
regulation
of
speech
must
be
content
neutral
absolutely
showing
of
a
compelling
state
interest
that
justifies
discrimination.
and
the
university
policy
of
neutrality
as
to
the
content
of
speech
does
not
sponsor
religion
any
more
than
the
speech
of
other
student
groups.
a
university's
mission
is
education.
our
decision
today
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
authority
of
a
university
to
impose
reasonable
regulations
compatible
with
that
mission
upon
the
use
of
its
campus
and
facilities.
in
this
case
however,
the
university
created
a
public
forum
from
which
only
religious
groups
were
excluded.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
