mr.
jeffrey
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
divided
court
of
appeals
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
case
presents
the
questions
of
whether
the
prohibitions
and
limitations
on
trade
association
solicitation
contained
in
1976
amendments
to
the
federal
election
campaign
act
can
survive
the
exacting
scrutiny
demanded
by
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
it
is
our
position
in
brief
that
the
restrictions
and
limitations
are
unconstitutional.
i
think
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
the
genesis
of
the
case
and
the
precise
nature
of
the
prohibitions
that
are
involved,
one
must
go
back
to
a
time
prior
to
may
of
1976,
which
was
the
effective
date
of
the
1976
amendments.
prior
to
that
time,
trade
associations
solicited
voluntary
political
contributions
from
a
wide
and
broad
range
of
people,
basically
who
fell
within...
people
who
shared
a
commonality
or
affinity
of
political
interests.
those
political
solicitations
were
undertaken
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
prospective
contributor
was
an
employee
of
a
member
corporation
of
the
trade
association.
and,
most
importantly,
they
were
undertaken
without
obtaining
the
prior
permission
of
anyone.
with
the
coming
of
the
1967
amendments,
however,
trade
association
solicitation
underwent
a
radical
and
drastic
transformation.
for
now,
no
longer
could
trade
associations
solicit
from
this
rather
broad
group
of
people
who
shared
a
commonality
of
purpose
and
interests;
rather,
they
were
restricted
by
the
act
to
either
their
own
shareholders
or
their
own
executives
and
administrators...
and
that
range
of
people
was
very
small
by
virtue
of
the
inherent
characteristics
of
trade
associations...
and/or
they
could
solicit
the
executives
and
administrative
personnel
and
the
stockholders
of
those
member
corporations.
but
in
addition
to
these
restrictions,
perhaps
the
most
throttling
restriction
was
that
before
even
that
narrow
solicitation
could
be
undertaken,
the
trade
association
political
action
committee
had
to
receive
the
permission
from
the
member
corporation.
that
is
to
say,
the
executive
or
administrative
employee
could
not
make
a
determination
on
his
own
of
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
be
solicited.
that
task
was
entrusted
by
the
act
to
the
corporation.
the
corporation
had
sole
and
unthrottled
discretion
in
the
matter.
it
was
unreviewable
by
anybody,
and
indeed,
it
could
be
denied
without
regard
to
the
wishes
of
the
corporate
employee
himself.
in
addition
to
that
restriction,
the
act
imposed
one
final
restriction,
and
that
was
even
if
all
of
the
other
statutory
prohibitions
had
been
satisfied,
and
even
if
the
corporation
in
its
largesse
gave
permission,
the
potential
contributor
could
only
be
solicited
by
one
trade
association,
regardless
of
the
amount
of
overlap
of
membership
in
other
separate,
distinct
and
autonomous
associations.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
except
the
practical
realities
of
life.
the
act
itself,
as
you
rightly
point
out,
does
not
restrict
a
trade
association
from
going
out
and
soliciting
people
to
join
with
it
as
a
member.
the
difficulty
is,
and
the
record
makes
clear,
that
trade
associations
have
rather
large
operating
budgets.
individuals
do
not
have
the
wherewithal...
and
i
suspect
they
do
not
have
the
inclination...
to
be
able
to
support
a
trade
association's
activities.
so
the
right
to
solicit
for
individual
membership
is
largely
illusory.
but
even
if
it
were
not,
your
honor,
if
underlying
your
question
is
the
suggestion
that
has
been
made
by
the
government
that
we
could
thus
avoid
the
restraints
of
the
sections
of
the
act,
then
i
think
we
are
giving
constitutional
significance
to
an
irrelevancy.
i
am
aware
of
no
case
in
the
history
of
this
court,
or
any
court,
which
has
said
otherwise
unconstitutional
prohibitions
are
okay
and
are
palatable
simply
because
there
is
a
method
of
avoiding
them.
and
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
and
that
is
what
the
government
is
suggesting
to
this
court.
the
effect
of
these
various
restrictions,
both
collectively
and
individually,
was
i
think
as
the
district
court's
unchallenged
findings
of
fact
make
clear,
at
once
profound
and
immediate.
the
district
court
found
that
the
act
found
that
the
act
had
substantially
curtailed
the
solicitation
activities
of
the
trade
associations;
that
it
had
impaired
substantially
their
right
to
collect
voluntary
political
contributions
and
thus
to
make
further
contributions;
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
it
had
limited
the
rights
of
potential
solicitees,
those
people
having
this
commonality
of
political
interests,
from
being
able
to
affiliate
with
the
trade
association
political
action
committee
and
with
other
like-minded
people.
as
a
consequence
of
these
restraints
and
as
a
consequence
of
the
impositions
imposed
by
the
act,
we
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
for
illinois.
after
some
very
protracted
proceedings
in
that
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
case
ultimately
came
on
for
hearing
before
the
seventh
circuit
sitting
en
banc
pursuant
to
section
437h
of
the
act.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
divided
in
some
instances
and
unanimous
in
others.
the
court
unanimously
held
that
the
plaintiffs
had
standing
under
2
u.s.c.
437h
to
maintain
the
action.
the
court,
however--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--we
certainly
do
not
contend
that
we
fit
within
the
explicit
enumerated
categories
of
people
set
forth
in
437h.
we
are
not
the
federal
election
commission,
and
we
are
certainly
not
the
national
committee
of
a
political
party,
and
we
are
certainly
not,
as
an
entity,
individuals
eligible
to
vote.
although,
your
honor,
let
me
point
out
that
our
members,
at
least
the
members
of
the
political
action
committees
themselves,
which
are
separate,
distinct
entities
as
this
court
held
in
california
medical
association,
are
comprised
solely
and
completely
of
members,
of
individuals.
the
federal
election
commission
has
never
contested
that
point
from
the
time
the
seventh
circuit
panel
announced
its
decision
in
1979
saying
that
aside
from
everything
else,
the
plaintiffs
had
associational
standing
under
the
rules
of
this
court
by
virtue
of
our
representation
of
individuals.
the
commission
has
never
suggested
or
said
that
we
do
not
represent
individuals.
they
simply
have
said
that
we
don't
fall
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
so
i
think,
your
honor,
that
we
have
associational
standing
without
any
question
at
all,
but
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
merely
because
we
don't
fall
within
the
explicit
enumerations
of
the
act
does
not
mean
that
we
are
not
a
proper
party.
the
purpose
of
that
statute,
437h,
as
this
court
unequivocally
held
in
buckley,
was
to
provide
standing
to
the
limit
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
that
beneficent
purpose
cannot
possibly
be
fulfilled
if
only
the
three
explicitly
enumerated
parties
are
accorded
standing.
it
would
mean
that
unions,
trade
associations
and
corporations,
who
are
the
entities
most
intimately
and
profoundly
affected
by
the
1976
amendments,
at
least
in
the
context
of
this
case,
could
not
maintain
an
action
under
437h,
even
though
an
anonymous
voter
from
boise,
idaho
who
had
absolutely
no
interest
in
the
particular
provisions
could
come
into
court,
get
the
substantially
expedited
review
that
the
statute
allows,
while
unions,
corporations
and
others--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
the
congress
perhaps
could
well
have
suggested
that
only
those
three
explicitly-enumerated
categories
of
people
could
avail
themselves
of
the
act.
the
question
is,
though,
it
does
not
say
"and
only
those".
and
thus,
one
must
divine
the
legislative
intent
underlying
that
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
i
think
we
would
not.
we
have
certainly
not
made
any.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
if
by
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
mean
it
is
meant
to
be
explicitly
exclusive,
i
disagree
with
you.
if
you
mean
it
says
what
it
says,
of
course
i
agree
with
you.
but
i
recall
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
admonition
that
the
notion
that
because
the
words
of
the
statute
are
plain
it's
meaning
is
also
plain
is
pernicious
over-simplification.
and
one
must
look
at
the
legislative
intent
underlying
the
statute,
and
the
intent
clearly
is
to
provide
expedition
in
appellate
review,
and
the
certainty
of
review
by
this
court.
and
that's
perhaps
the
most
important
factor.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes.
and
the
language
of
the
statute
certainly
is
not
clear.
this
court,
in
the
bogus
case,
has
referred
to
the
inexactitude
of
congressional
language
in
the
act
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
i
think
you
do
often,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
are
you
asking
me
could
we
have?
mr.
jeffrey
cole
there
was
some
question
at
the
time
of
the
availability
of
people
to
come
in.
it
was
our
view
that
the
statute
was
at
least
to
us
clear
that
it
would
be
incongruous
to
read
the
statute
in
the
way
the
fec
has
done,
and
that
we
didn't
need
anybody.
and
the
case
ultimately
progressed
as
it
did.
interestingly
enough,
had
we
brought
in
an
officer
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
the
fec
would
have
contested,
as
it
did
in
the
california
medical
association
case,
that
the
identity
of
the
officer
and
the
identity
of
the
corporate
entity
were
fully
congruent
and
thus,
that
individual
had
no
standing,
although
he
fell,
your
honor,
within
the
literal
language
of
437h.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
totally
thwarted.
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit...
and
i
think
our
briefs...
explain
in
some
detail
precisely
why
that
is
so.
i
must
again
underscore
the
fact,
your
honor,
even
if
you
were
to
read
the
statute
in
a
very
narrow
way,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
would
still
have
standing
under
437
in
this
case
under
accepted
and
established
and
i
think
unquestioned
principles
of
associational
standing.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
no,
we
did
not.
and
let
me
tell
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
retrospect,
why
that
was
not
done.
when
the
seventh
circuit
announced
its
opinion
in
december
of
1979,
it
articulated
the
proposition
that
we
had
associational
standing
by
virtue
of
the
individual
members
that
the
plaintiffs
possess.
now,
thereafter,
there
were
long
proceedings
involving
discovery,
the
preparation
of
stipulated
facts
and
so
on.
the
commission
never
once
suggested,
ever,
that
out
of
the
hundreds,
perhaps
thousands,
of
individual
people
who
were
contributors
and
thus
members
of
the
pac's,
that
these
people,
at
least
one
of
them,
was
not
an
individual
voter.
and
thus,
the
need
for
proof
never
arose.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
well,
i
think
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
very
clear,
as
all
of
us
were
at
the
time,
that
we
were
not
representing
people
who
were
14
and
15
and
16
years
old.
the
people
that
we
were
representing
were
people
who
were
intimately
concerned
with
and
involved
in
the
political
process.
and
clearly,
at
least
one
of
them
was
eligible
to
vote,
and
the
government
never
suggested
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
i
think
that
it
does,
mr.
justice
stevens.
if
one
looks
at
the
buckley
case,
for
example,
there
is
a
statement
in
buckley
in
which
this
court
said
at
least
some
of
the
appellants
have
standing.
immediately
following
that
statement,
appeared
footnote
10.
and
in
that
footnote,
the
court
did
not
make
any
reference
to
the
individual
plaintiffs
who
clearly
were
involved
in
the
case.
senator
buckley
obviously
was
eligible
to
vote,
and
i
think
the
allegations
were
made
in
that
complaint.
instead,
the
court
focused
upon
the
organizational
nature
of
the
plaintiffs
who
under
the
government's
reading,
and
under
a
cramped
review
of
437h,
would
not
have
standing.
now,
unless
we
are
to
attribute
to
this
court
and
to
its
law
secretaries
an
exceedingly
high
degree
of
caprice,
i
think
that
focus
on
the
organizational
rather
than
the
individual
plaintiffs
must
have
some
significance.
that
is
what--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
right.
the
allegations
are
clear
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
and
that
is
that
the
impact
adversely
on
not
only
the
rights
of
the
trade
associations
and
the
political
action
committees,
but
indeed...
and
we
explicitly
noted
this
in
the
complaint,
and
it
is
in
i
think
one
of
our
briefs,
either
our
opening
or
reply
brief...
that
it
also
impacted
adversely
on
the
right
of
prospective
solicitees.
that
is,
the
corporate
executives,
administrators
and
stockholders
of
our
member
corporations.
and
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
were
many,
many
challenges
at
issue
in
buckley.
but
all
of
those
challenges
jurisdictionally
were
subsumed
under
437h.
so
the
diversity
of
the
challenges,
i
think,
does
not
speak
to
the
question
of
the
court's
underlying
jurisdiction.
and
the
court's
focus,
unlike
the
district
court's
focus
in
buckley,
was
not
on
the
individual
plaintiffs;
it
was
rather
upon
the
organizational
plaintiffs
who
had
associational
or
organizational
standing.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
i
think
the
statute,
your
honor,
was
designed
to
expand
rather
than
to
contract
traditional
notions
of
standing.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes.
i
think
congress
felt
that
all
of
these
other
people
who
were
clearly
and
immediately
and
adversely
affected,
who
had
suffered
in
short
injury
in
fact,
would
of
course
be
able
to
come
in
under
this
particular
remedy.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
no.
and
i
think
the
reason
they
did
not
is
twofold.
when
one
looks
at
the
language
of
the
statutes
dealing
with
aggrieved
parties,
one
always
finds
those
statutes
involved
in
agency
action.
one
is
aggrieved
by
the
action
of
an
agency.
i
have
never
seen
a
jurisdictional
statute,
kind
of
like
this,
that
talks
about
parties
that
are
aggrieved
by
the
action
of
a
statute.
thus,
the
use
of
the
word
"aggrieved"
would
have
been
inappropriate.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
and
we
would
get
into
court
even
if
we
didn't
wait.
if
we
brought
an
action
under
1331--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--and
that
then
puts
people
on
the
horns
of
an
insoluble
dilemma,
as
well
as
putting
the
first
amendment
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
it
means--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--if
people
either
have
to
have
the
temerity
to
violate
the
law
and
then
see
what
the
fec
will
do,
or...
and
this
is
the
more
likely
consequence...
they
will
be
chilled
in
their
activity
and
not
undertake
the
activity,
thereby
precluding
the
very
enforcement
proceeding
in
which
to
raise
the
challenge
defensively.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
of
course.
and
this
court
sits
to
review
that.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
that's
the
question
for
us.
the
commission's
view
is
that
we
wouldn't
even
have
1331
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
that
is
almost
frivolous.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
underlying
the
general
prohibitions,
the
longstanding
general
prohibitions
against
corporate
and
union
expenditures
and
contributions
in
federal
elections
was
the
felt
perception
that
these
entities,
because
of
their
aggregated
wealth
and
otherwise,
had
had
a
corrosive
and
pernicious
effect
on
our
whole
system
of
representative
government.
ironically,
however,
the
act
that
is
presently
before
the
court
entrusts
to
those
various
entities
the
censorial
power
of
determining
whether
or
not
employees
of
member
corporations
can
have
the
right
to
receive
telephone
calls
soliciting,
to
receive
mail
seeking
political
contributions;
indeed,
to
be
able
to
talk
to
another
citizen
on
the
street
to
solicit
for
a
political
contribution
now
requires
the
arbitrary
discretionary
consent
of
the
very
entities
that
have
so
polluted
the
process.
the
corporation,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
noted,
can
decline
permission
under
the
act
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason.
it
can
do
so
because
the
corporate
officer
in
charge
doesn't
like
the
stance,
political
stance,
that
a
trade
association
perhaps
has
taken.
it
can
do
so
because
it
doesn't
like
the
corporation's
stance
on...
there
are
too
many
women
in
the
organization,
there's
not
enough
women;
there's
too
many
jews,
there's
not
enough
jews;
there's
too
many
blacks,
there's
not
enough.
any
reason
or
no
reason
will
suffice.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes,
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
i
would
be
thrilled
but
not
satisfied.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes.
i
think
that...
no.
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
no,
because
i
think
that
the
range--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--no,
i
would
not
be
satisfied
for
this
reason.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
no,
i
don't
think
that
at
all.
but
i
thought
your
question
was
if
we
wound
up
in
the
same
position,
would
that
please
me.
and
my
answer--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--no.
i
think
if
there
was
an
equivalency
of
treatment
which,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs,
there
is
not,
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional,
the
answer
is
no.
it
seems
to
me,
however,
there
is
a
patent
discrimination
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--that's
why
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
mr.
justice
white,
that--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--the
inherent
structure
of
trade
associations,
which
as
entities
trace
their
lineages
back
to
before
the
turn
of
the
century,
are
such
that
they
have
no
stockholders--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--they
have
virtually
no
administrative
employee--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--i
think
the
present
regulation
is
indeed
more
severe
than
that.
it
seems
to
me...
and
this
is
at
least
the
opinion,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
department
of
justice...
that
corporations'
unions
have
the
right
to
solicit
and
the
right
to
communicate
with
not
simply
some
very
narrow
range
of
individuals,
but
all
of
those
people
with
whom
there
is
a
shared
political
or
commonality
of
interest.
and
that
is
part
of
what
we're
seeking
here,
but
certainly
we
are
suggesting
to
you
that
the
restraints
in
section
(d)
are
facially
unconstitutional.
but
our
complaint
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
it
could
not.
direct
political--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--mr.
justice
powell,
may
i
ask
you,
when
you
say
contributions,
do
you
mean
with
its
own
funds
or
with
the
funds
that
have
been
contributed
to
it?
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes.
and
it
could
make
contributions
with
those
funds.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes,
sir,
it
could.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes,
because
it
was
not...
theoretically,
at
least...
not
the
union's
funds
that
were
being
contributed;
it
was
the
funds
of
contributors
all
around
that
were
doing
nothing
more
than
using
the
pac
as
a
focal
point
for
political
affiliation.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
and
that
has
been
the
case
since
the
afl-cio
established
its
pac
in
the
thirties
or
forties.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
no,
i
would
like
to
have
the
restraints
in
subsection
(d),
in
effect,
inter-lineated.
we
are
not
asking
that
the
entire
section
be
taken
away.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
oh,
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
not
at
all.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
well,
i
think
that's
right.
but
certainly
we
are
asking
that
the
restraints
be
taken
away,
and
i
think
that
was
the
solution
that
judge
pell
arrived
at,
and
that
is
the
solution
that
we
would
advocate
to
the
court.
i--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--yes.
always.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
before
that
they
were
doing
it.
there
were
pac's
in
existence
for
many
years.
i
can't
tell
you
for
how
many
years,
but
certainly
from
the
time
of
the
afl-cio
pac.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
in
fact,--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--many
years.
and
as
your
opinion
in
the
pipefitters
case
discussed
at
some
length.
so
what
is
being
done
under
the
1971
act
as
amended
is
nothing
new
or
novel
or
different;
it's
been
going
on
in
political
life
in
this
country
for
the
last
several
decades.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
well,
that's
the
question;
whether
or
not
the
hansen
amendment
constituted
a
modification
or
codification
or
prior
law.
this
court
refused
to
decide
that
case
in
pipefitters.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
given
the
rationale
of
the
first
amendment,
that
corporations,
unions
and
trade
associations
always
had
the
right
to
communicate
with,
in
whatever
way
they
wanted
and
with
their
own
funds,
that
group
with
whom
they
shared
an
affinity
of
interest.
and
as
this
court
said
in
pipefitters,
precisely
the
same
rationale
underlays
the
right
to
solicit
political
funds.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
i
had
thought,
until
mr.
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
california
medical,
that
there
had
not
been
a
dispute
that
the
right
to
solicit
or,
indeed,
to
make
political
contributions...
and
the
two
are
not
exactly
the
same,
although
they
are
obverse
sides
of
the
same
coin...
was
subject
to
the
exacting
scrutiny
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
i
had
thought,
again
in
light
of
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
citizens
against
rent
control
v.
berekely,
that
that
question
would
now
have
been
decided
in
the
affirmative.
yes.
my
answer
to
you
is
solicitation
is
intimately
bound
up
with
speech.
and
what
we
have
done
is
to
simply
want
to
go
out
and
talk
to
people
and
to
see
if,
in
the
competition
of
the
marketplace,
we
can
align
ourselves
with
them
and
to
win
their
political
allegiance.
that's
really
what
is
going
on,
and
that
we
cannot
do.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
exacting
scrutiny
under
the
first
amendment
is
the
test
that
is
to
be
applied,
not
some
diminished
standard
of
review.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
the
government
has
conceded,
as
i
think
that
it
must,
that
the
avowed
purpose
of
the
restraints
in
section
(d)
are
to
limit
the
fund-raising
potential
of
trade
associations
as
opposed
to
all
other
groups,
unions
and
corporations.
this
court,
in
buckley,
has
specifically
and
unambiguously
repudiated
that
sort
of
an
attempt
as
being
violative
of
the
first
amendment.
the
court
there
said
that
attempts
to
equalize
the
relativability
of
individuals
in
groups
to
influence
the
outcome
of
elections
is
prohibited.
the
concept
that
government
may
restrict
the
speech...
and
it
seems
to
me
a
fortiori
the
associational
rights
of
people...
of
some
elements
of
society
in
order
to
enhance
the
relative
voice
of
others
is
wholly
foreign
to
the
first
amendment.
the
purposes
underlying
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act
and
its
successor
are
twofold.
it
is
to
eliminate
the
actuality
and
appearance
of
corruption
resulting
from
large
campaign
contributions,
and
equally
important
as
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out
in
belotti,
as
jr.
justice
frankfurter
initially
pointed
out
in
the
auto
workers
case,
indeed
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
even
in
his
dissent
in
the
rent
control
case
against
berkeley,
is
to
preserve
the
citizens'
confidence
in
government
and
to
actively
underwrite
and
encourage
their
participation
in
our
democracy.
the
restraints
of
section
(d)
make
a
mockery
out
of
that
second
but
equally
primary
goal.
the
notion
that
a
citizen's
right
to
be
solicited,
to
talk
to
another
person
about
the
ability
to
contribute
money
and
to
affiliate
himself
thereby
with
other
like-minded
people,
that
that
can
be
made
to
depend
upon
the
whim
of
his
corporate
employer,
in
ny
view
trivializes
the
first
amendment
and
makes
a
mockery
out
of
it.
it
goes
a
giant
step
towards
not
advancing,
but
retarding
the
goal
of
citizens'
participation
and
confidence
in
government.
at
pages
8
through
13,
of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
addressed
at
some
length
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
about
the
purposes
of
the
anti-proliferation
rules.
and
obviously,
time
simply
does
not
allow
me
to
answer
those
questions,
but
i
do
urge
the
court
to
review
those
pages.
and
there
is
one
final
point.
i
have
mis-spoke
myself,
mr.
justice
powell,
and
i
want
to
apologize
if
i
did.
i'd
like
to
clarify.
prior
to
the
1976
amendments,
trade
associations
solicited
without
regard
to
the
restraints
imposed
now
by
section
(d),
they
solicited
all
those
people
within
the
range
of
affinity
of
interest
without
regard
to
whether
they
were
corporate
employees
of
member
corporations,
and
they
did
so
without
obtaining
anyone's
prior
permission.
those
funds
that
were
voluntarily
contributed
were
then
expended
by
the
trade
association
pac's
in
federal
elections,
consistent
with
the
course
of
behavior
that
had
gone
on
for
the
last
30
or
40
years.
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
no.
corporations,
your
honor,
were
doing
precisely
the
same
thing.
they
solicited
within
the
range
of
permissible
solici...
i'm
sorry...
within
the
range
of
all
of
those
who
had
a
shared
affinity
of
interest.
mr.
jeffrey
cole
absolutely.
they
specifically
held
or
said
in
the
statute
the
only
people
that
corporations
could
now
solicit
were
their
stockholders
and
their
executive
and
administrative--
mr.
jeffrey
cole
--yes,
our
sources
were
specified
as
being
the
executive
and
administrative
personnel
and
the
stockholders
of
our
member
corporations,
which
for
all
intents
and
purposes
did
not
exist,
and
the
executives
and
administrators
of
our
member
corporations
and
stockholders.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
the
only
natural
and
legitimate
constituents
that
trade
associations
have,
at
the
very
minimum...
although
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that...
are
those
people
who
work
for
corporations
who
are
our
members.
