mr.
charles
n.
steele
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
deal
first
with
the
issue
of
regarding
437h,
which
is
the
sole
basis
for
jurisdiction
asserted
here.
in
effect,
i
think
that
the
question
before
the
court
is
a
question
that
was
explicitly
left
open
by
the
california
medical
association
case
last
term,
and
that
is
whether
the
parties
not
enumerated
by
the
statute
have
standing
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
hear
cases
under
the
specialized
procedures
of
section
437h.
basically,
we
have
here
a
conflict
with
appellants
on
both
questions.
appellants,
it
seems
to
me,
assert
two
bases
under
which
this
court
should
read
437h
as
allowing
them
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
first
they
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
this
court's
associational
rights
doctrine,
that
they
are
sufficiently
related
to
individuals
to
be
able
to
assert
those
rights
as
an
association
on
behalf
of
individuals.
they
draw
on
the
long
line
of
cases,
some
of
them
referred
to
by
this
court,
in
buckley
with
regard
to
associations
that
were
there,
that
say
that
individuals...
that
started
from
the
premise
that
individuals
should
be
able
to
assert
constitutional
rights
when
those
rights
might
be
lost
if
they
didn't
assert
them,
and
have
since
been
expanded
to
a
much
broader
basis
that
allows
associations
to
assert
individual
constitutional
rights.
we
would
urge
this
court,
however,
not
to
extent
that
to
this
case
because
the
plaintiffs
here
are
not
associations
which
represent
individuals.
they
are,
indeed,
trade
associations.
they
represent
the
business
interests,
they
are
controlled
by
corporations.
the
record
is
replete
with
the
fact
that
all
of
the
governing
structure
of
all
of
these
trade
associations
comes
from
the
corporate
membership.
the
voting
rights...
there
are
not
individual
voting
rights,
and
by
and
large,
the
control
of
those
is
left
to
the
business
interest.
and
therefore,
what
is
represented
by
these
trade
associations
and
by
their
separate
segregated
funds,
the
political
committees
which
they
have
established,
which
they
finance
and
which
they
control,
are
the
interests
of
the
trade
associations.
and
i
would
have
this
court
look
at
its
decision
in
the
pipefitters
case
for
the
fact
that
clearly,
a
corporation's
separate
segregated
fund...
the
political
committee
that
it
was
allowed
to
establish
under
the
1971-72
amendments
and
that
this
court
examined
in
the
1973
case
of
pipefitters,
that
the
control
there
is
with
the
trade
association,
with
the
corporation.
moreover,
under
those
amendments,
they
are
explicitly
allowed
to
establish
and
to
finance,
to
maintain,
those,
so
that
there
is
in
this
statute
not...
the
political
committee
is
not
the
paradigm
of
a
political
committee
made
up
of
individuals.
the
statute
establishes
these
committees
as
controlled
by
the
corporation.
accordingly,
while
they
are,...
as
we
have
not
contested,
while
the
contributions
to
them
are
ones
that
are
made
voluntarily
by
individuals,
they
are
not
associations
in
the
sense
of
individual
associations.
they
are
not
a
situation
of
ten
individuals
getting
together.
indeed,
one
of
the
balances
struck
by
congress
in
the
statute
was
explicitly
noted
by
this
court
in
the
cio
case
and
in
the
legislative
history,
that
nothing
in
this
statute
bars
ten
individuals
who
are
members
of
the
union
from
going
out
and
setting
up
a
political
action
committee,
or
of
a
corporation.
what
is
barred
by
this
statute
is
the
use
of
the
corporate
or
labor
organization
funds.
so
that
what
is
at
issue
here
with
regard
to
the
437h
issue
in
the
associational
sense
is
the
question
that
we
have
put
forth,
and
contrary
to
my
brother,
mr.
cole,
i
think
that
the
commission
has
consistently
challenged
the
fact
that
they
have
standing
to
assert
individual
rights.
a
second
challenge
that
they
bring
to
the
437h
area
is
that
it's
the
nature
of
the
challenge
which
should
dominate
here.
they
agree,
as
was
said
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
they
are
not
among
the
enumerated
parties,
but
they
say
that
those
enumerated
parties
are
not
what
establishes
the
standing;
that
the
standing
is
much
broader
than
that.
that
indeed,
as
they
have
phrased
it,
particularly
in
their
opening
brief,
it
is
the
nature
of
the
challenge
that
congress
was
putting
forward.
in
support
of
that,
they
have...
as
the
bare
words
of
the
statute,
which
say
explicitly
and
which
we
have
contented
throughout
say
explicitly,
only
three
parties.
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
indicated
that
they
felt
that
the
reason
for
putting
in
those
three
parties
was
to
expand
the
jurisdiction.
that
there
might
have
been
doubt
about
any
one
of
those
three...
the
commission,
the
national
committee
of
a
political
party
or
an
individual
eligible
to
vote,...
as
to
whether
they
could
bring
suit.
the
words
of
the
statute
are
bare.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
does
not
seem
to
me
to
support
the
idea
that
that
was
meant
to
be
read
that
broadly.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
is
remitted
to
the
basic
idea
that
congress
would
be
the
one
that
establishes
the
jurisdiction,
and
indeed,
appellants
here
do
not
challenge
the
fact
that
this
is
a
question
of
interpretation,
of
what
was
congress'
intent
in
enacting
this
statute.
and
once
again,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
view
that
as
not
being
a
broad
base
attempt
to
say
that
anyone
can
bring
suit,
but
that
the
congress
very
explicitly
set
forth
those
parties.
that
particularly
where
you
are
talking...
and
as
we've
noted
in
cases
cited...
particularly
where
you
are
talking
extraordinary
jurisdiction,
as
you
certainly
are
where
you
have
a
certification
of
issues
from
a
district
court,
an
en
banc
court
of
appeals
and
a
right
of
appeal
to
this
court,
that
the
ordinary
thrust
would
be
to
construe
that
narrowly.
thus,
with
regard
to
the
437h
issue,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
reject
both
of
the
theories
that
they
have
put
forth
for
the
broad
interpretation.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
another
disagreement
that
we
have
with
appellants,
which
is
really
the
effect
of
the
1976
amendments.
which
is
to
say,
as
was
said
in
response
to
justice
white's
questions,
in
the
commission's
view,
this
statute
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
441b
prohibitions
which
have
been
in
the
statute
since
1907;
they
were
originally
there
as
18
u.s.c.
610,
and
contain
a
broad
prohibition
on
the
use
of
corporation
funds,
any
corporation
whatsoever.
but
that
prohibition
has
been
balanced
over
time
by
the
congress
and
by
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
congress'
reactions
to
those
decisions
for
those
parties
specified
in
441b,
corporations
and
labor
organizations,
a
balance
of
that
that
allows
them
to
establish,
finance,
maintain
and
control
a
fund
which
is
allowed
to
solicit
contributions
from
that
are
part
of
the
corporation.
what
it
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history
as
the
beneficial
owners,
that
going
back
to
1907.
in
1947,
the
amendment
to
include
labor
organizations
where
the
statute
then
put
that
forth
as
members,
that
members
were
the
parallel
in
the
labor
organization
situation
to
the
shareholders
of
the
corporation,
in
effect.
so
that
the
statutory
interest
underlying
this
is
a
limitation
of
the
use
of
the
corporation's
funds,
and
these
trade
associations
are
corporations.
the
use
of
those
funds
to
solicit
outside.
that
the
compromise,
the
balance
that
was
reached
between
the
initial
enactment,
the
1947
enactments,
the
response
to
that
in
the
cio
case
and
then
the
pipefitters
case,
was
a
special
situation
for
these
organizations,
which
allows
a
corporation
to
spend
all
of
the
corporate
funds
for
the
limited
purpose
of
communicating
with
its
beneficial
owners
and
the
operators,
the
executive
and
administrative
personnel.
so
that
the
government
purpose
underlying,
the
governmental
basis
underlying
it,
is
that
of
441b.
i
would
note
in--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
if
there
is
not...
if
the
corporation's
funds
are
not
used,
and
that
is
what
i
meant
in
the
earlier
discussion
and
it's
replete
in
the
47
history,
that
individuals
volunteering
who
happen
all
to
be
members
of
a
corporation
establishing
a
political
action
committee,
not
using
corporation's
funds,
are
not
governed
by
section
441b.
so
in
that
sense,
i
think
the
response
is
yes,
you
could
have
that
situation.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
trade
association
itself
could
not,
in
the
sense
that
because
of
using
volunteers
it
would
be
establishing
and
maintaining
that.
so
there
are
really
three
prongs
to
it.
they
establish
it,
maintain
it,
financial
support,
pay
for
its
solicitations,
put
out
the
money
to
put
the
solicitations
out,
and
pursuant
to
the
pipefitters
case,
control
these.
now,
if
none
of
those
four
elements
were
there,...
in
other
words,
if
they
didn't
establish
it,
didn't
maintain
it,
didn't
finance
it,
didn't
finance
its
solicitations
and
didn't
control
it,
it
would
seem
to
me
you
would
then
have
a
truly
voluntary
situation.
but
with
those
four
elements
there...
and
i
think
any
one
of
those
four
elements
is
sufficient,
but
those
are
the
four
major
ones...
you
don't
have
a
situation
where
the
trade
association
could
use
volunteers,
because
it
would
have
established
the
separate
segregated
fund
and
maintained,
financed
and
controlled
it.
i
would
note,
incidentally,
that
throughout
this
case
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
the
basic
provisions
of
441b.
appellants
here
have
no
desire
whatsoever
to
give
up
the
permission
of
the
statute
that
allows
them
to
do
that
financially-valuable
support.
the
trade
associations...
there's
a
rising
number
of
political
committees
in
all
areas,
but
particularly
in
the
corporate
and
trade
association
area,
one
finds
that
in
recent
years
with
the
development
of
the
law,
here
has
been
a
vast
expansion
of
trade
associations
using
their
funds
to
support
political
committees.
the
permission
of
the
statute
allowing
them
to
do
that
is
very,
very
valuable
to
them
and
is
very
valuable
to
the
corporation.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
factors
with
regard
to
this
case
is
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
congress,
over
the
course
of
time,
particularly
in
1971
and
1976,
has
come
to
regulate
the
area
with
great
precision.
there
is
a
very
narrow
regulation
here
compared
to
the
historical
development,
in
the
sense
that
the
1907
statute
was
just
what
is
the
beginning
of
the
statute.
you
now
in
1976
the
insertion
not
only
of
subsection
(d),
but
of
subsections
(a),
(b)
and
(c),
(4)(a),
(b),
(c)
and
(d),
which
spell
out
with
great
precision
the
balance,
in
terms
of
the
solicitation
rights.
and
quite
frankly,
our
view
is
that
the
corporation's
rights
to
solicit
it
shareholders
and
executive
and
administrative
personnel
have
been
here
expanded
by
section
(d).
thus,
the
argument
from
appellant's
side
is
without
section
(d)...
section
(d)
was
a
limitation.
as
the
court
below
held
and
as
we
have
consistently
stated,
that
seems
to
us
not
to
be
so.
what
you
have
in
section
(d),
what
congress
did
in
1976,
was
to
add
a
broader
permission
that
was
brought
in
front
of
them
that
trade
associations
therefore
had
very
limited
solicitation
rights,
and
they
came
to
the
result
that
is
now
in
front
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
again,
i
think
that
goes
back
to
the
history
of
610,
but
that
the
basic
answer
to
that
is
that
the
corporation's
expenditure
of
funds
there,
the
amounts
that
they
are
spending
for
these
political
committees,
makes
it
part
of
a
specialized
structure,
and
that
there
is
an
attempt
to
limit
the
corporations
in
spending
that
money,
that
money
that
they
have
aggregated
through
their
special--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think,
as
i
say,
the
answer
is
partly
the
historical
answer
that
that
was
the
balance
that
was
struck.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no,
i
would
say
that
it's
saying,
more
than
that,
in
that
congress
in
seeing
corporations
and
labor
organizations
as
vastly
different
organizations,
attempted
to
limit
their
ability
to
go
widespread
into
the
world.
the
statutory
history
of
these
sections--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--because
the
amount
of
money
that
they
can
pour
into
solicitation
is
immense.
again,
in
specific
regard
to
the
trade
associations--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--it
might
be
a
possible--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
would
think
that
that
statute
would
be
constitutional,
also.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
basic
congressional
understanding
was
the
limitation
of
those
organizations
from
going
out
to
the
public.
the
basic
underlying
interest
that
they
have
in
participating
in
the
political
process
is
in
joining
together
with
them
the
people
who
are
associated
with
them,
the
beneficial
owners.
that
they
do
not
have
a
constitutionally-protected
interest
in
communicating
out
to
everyone
throughout
the
country;
that
broad-scale
public
appeals
for
funds
was
something
that
the
congress
sought
to
prohibit.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
because
of
the
immense
power
that
resides
in
corporations
from
that;
the
ability
to
solicit
funds
is
largely
dependent
upon
the
amount
of
money
going
into
it--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--but
they
are
permitted
to
spend
large
amounts,
as
they
are
qualified
multi-candidate
committees,
they
can
spent
$5000
in
both
the
primary
and
general
election,
and
there
are
460
elections
every
two
years,
not
speaking
of
the
presidential.
so
it
allows
them
to
maximize
the
amount
of
funds.
indeed,
i
think
one
of
the
arguments--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--the
limitation
that
congress
put
was
a
limitation
on
the
use
of
the
corporate
funds.
those
funds--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
it
doesn't
say
it
as
x
number
of
people;
it
specified--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--and
specific
categories
with
whom
they
have
a
direct
relationship.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
would
not
concede
that
it
was
less
restrictive
in
the
sense
that
the
permission
of
spending
the
funds...
in
other
words,
if
you
struck
down
the
entire
statute
and
started
over
again,
but
in
effect,
you
would
have
then
the
fact
that
you
would
have
a
limitation
on
corporations
of
spending
funds
for
the
purposes
of
solicitation.
the
expenditure
of
those
funds
for
broad
base
purposes
from
the
corporation's
funds
would
be
limited
by
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute.
but
what
you
have
here
is
a
special
section
which
has
dealt
with
corporations
and
labor
organizations,
singled
them
out
as
having
economic
power,
interest
in
the
economic
sphere,
and
that
you
have
a
different
sphere
of
regulation
for
them
than
you
do
for
political
committees.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
said
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
solicit
that
cannot
be
limited.
there
is
clear
indication
from
many
opinions
of
this
court...
schaumberg,
many
others...
that
you
have
an
intertwining
in
solicitation
of
communication,
but
that
solicitation
has
always
been
treated
differently
and
is
not
the
paradigm
of
a
first
amendment
speech
right.
that
the
question
of
solicitation
of
legitimate
government
regulation
in
support
of
an
interest
which
the
government
establishes
as
being
important,
which
here
is
the
basic
underlying...
in
response
to
your
earlier
question...
the
basic
underlying
interest
in
the
government
in
regulating
the
use
of
corporations'
aggregated
funds,
is
very,
very
strong.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
read
that
i
would
have
is
that
the
1907
statute
prohibited
that
entirely.
you
come
up
to
the
cio--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--any
corporation
whatsoever
from
making
contributions--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--no.
it
was
amended
not
long
thereafter
to
include
expenditures
because
of
the
congressional
findings
barring
contributions--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--the
1971-72
amendments.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
i
think
that
that
congressional
action
was
founded
on
the
analysis
of--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
the
entire
hearings
on
the
question
of
cope
in
1943
and
47
when
they
made
permanent
the
act
revolve
around
those
questions
of
where
the
funds
came
from.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
there
were
no
explicit--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--until
1971
when
the
first
congressional
enactment
limiting
them.
but
as
i--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--yes.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
prior
to
that,
in
the
corporate
area
the
expenditure
of
funds
for
solicitation
had
never
arisen,
i
think
because
of
a
common
understanding
that
the
statute
barred
that
kind
of
expenditure
by
corporations.
corporations
using
their
funds
to
go
out
and
raise
funds
out
in
the
world
to
contribute
to
candidates
was
something
that
was
not
done--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
would
think
that
that
would
be
so,
but
that
is
not...
i
don't
think
that
is
before
this
court
here.
but
the
answer
would
be
that
that
seems
to
be
the
effect
of
the
historical
development.
that
what
you
have
is
corporations
and
labor
organizations
setting
up
funds
which
they
do
control.
that
was,
of
course,
one
of
the
questions
that
was
really
brought
forth
in
the
pipefitters
case,
the
question
of
whether
that
fund
could
be
controlled
by
the
corporations
or,
in
that
instance,
by
the
labor
organizations.
the
arguments
there
to
begin
with
were
that
that
fund,
one,
as
a
factual
matter,
that
that
was
not
controlled,
and
this
court
effectively
said
that
they
didn't
need
to
reach
that
issue
because
even
if
they
were
controlled,
they
felt
that
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
the
two
provisions...
i
don't
think
it
is
protected
under
441a(a)(5),
because
quite
explicitly--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--the
language...
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
backs
it
up...
that
congress
was
very
explicit
that
they
did
not
want
trade
associations
per
se
to
be
deemed
affiliated
with
their
members.
what
they
did
in
the
a(a)(5)
sections
was
to
list
where
they
did
the
subordinate
corporations,
et
cetera.
but
the
legislative
history
underlying
that
shows
that
one
of
the
reasons
they
enacted
the
present
section
was
because
in
the
trade
association
area,
they
wanted
to
allow
some
solicitation,
listening
to
the
pleas
of
the
trade
associations
that
are
similar
to
those
made
here.
otherwise,
we
would
have
a
very
limit
class
of
solicitees.
but
not
wanting,
with
the
cross
overlapping
membership
where
you
have,
as
this
record
shows
and
really
is
undoubted,
that
you
have
corporations
belonging
to
many
trade
associations,
that
you
have
the
limitation,
therefore,
of
the
corporation
being
able
to
go
through
one
trade
association
but
not
through
others.
and
that
was
a
limitation
designed
in
a
parallel
sense
to
441a(a)(5),
but
it
does
not
cover
the
same
ground.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
the
case
is
sent
back
to
the
district
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
jurisdictional
basis
cited
here
is
437h,
and
as
i
say,
except
for
the--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
the
district
court
i
think
would
then
have
to
consider
the
question
that
was
enumerated
in
the
exchange
with
justice
white
as
to
whether
in
this
situation
you
would
have
1331
jurisdiction.
we
argued
to
the
district
court
that
there
was
not
1331
jurisdiction
on
the
grounds
that
congress
had
very
specifically
in
this
statute
set
forth
the
methods
for
review
of
the
statute
437h,
437g,
so
that
therefore
there
was
no
1331
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
that,
was
then,
in
effect,
reversed
when
the
1292
appeal
went
up
on
the
437h
issue,
and
so
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case
the
only
jurisdiction
asserted
is
the
437h
jurisdiction.
again,
with
regard
to
the
issue,
as
i
say--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
certainly
think
that
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
assert
it.
i
think
we
would
oppose
it
for
the
same
reasons
that
we
did
before.
indeed,
their
original
complaint
asserted
1331
as
a
jurisdictional
base,
but
that,
as
i
say,
the
district
court
found
1331
jurisdiction
and
found
no
437
h
jurisdiction.
appeal
taken
from
that
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
which
determine
that
the
jurisdiction
lies
under
437h,
and
remands
the
case
to
be
treated
as
a
437h
case.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
they
certainly
could.
but
i
think
there's
a
very
significant
distinction...
as
i
say,
i
think
the
1331
jurisdiction
question
is
itself
a
very
difficult
one.
and
as
i
say,--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--no,
it
is
certainly
not
before
you.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
with
regard
to
the
two
issues
raised
with
regard
to
the
narrow
matter
of
the
subsection
(d)
here,
the
basic...
and
i
think
i
indicated
this
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
question...
but
the
basic
congressional
interest
there
was
similar
to
that
in
the
anti-proliferation
area.
section
(d)
permits
only
the
solicitation
of
only
one...
allows
a
corporation
to
allow
solicitation
of
its
employees,
of
its
shareholders
and
executive
and
administrative
personnel
only
by
one
trade
association,
and
it
is
quite
explicit
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
congressional
balancing
there,
once
again,
was
the
limitation
of
the
fact
that
otherwise,
corporations
being
members
of
many
trade
associations
would
be
able
to...
you
would
have
a
proliferation
of
the
funds
available.
and
that
the
basic
underlying
congressional
thrust
for
this
statute
was
the
limitation
of
those
funds.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
once-a-year
provision
that
congress
has
enacted,
that
appears
to
be
a
provision
that
is
designed
to
assure
that
the
permission
that
is
granted
is
one
that
is
not
done
on
a
continuing
basis;
i.
e,
that
the
reaffirmation
that
that
is
the
trade
association
that
the
corporation
feels
that
its
members
can
be
solicited
by
is
one
that
is
reaffirmed
constantly.
i
would
note
that
it
is
also
one
that
the
commission,
in
speaking
in
its
recommendations
to
congress,
has
thought
that
congress
may
want
to
re-examine
as
perhaps
not
being
worth
the
effort.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
as
to
its
basic
constitutionality,
the
underlying
basis
for
it
is
the
same
as
the
overall
basis
for
the
441b(4)(d)
to
support
the
441b(4)(d)
provisions
altogether.
thank
you.
