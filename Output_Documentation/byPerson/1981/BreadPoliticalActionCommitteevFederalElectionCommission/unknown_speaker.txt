unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
is
there
anything
in
the
act
that
prevents
a
trade
association
from
seeking
to
add
these
people
as
members
of
the
trade
association?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
on
that
point,
how
does
the
committee
fit
under
the
language
of
the
statute,
437h,
as
a
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
an
argument
that
if
congress,
after
enumerating
those
three,
had
said
"and
no
one
else",
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
to
read
as
if
"and
only
those"
appeared,
you
would
have
no
challenge
to
its
constitutionality?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
is
certainly
quite
explicit
in
identifying
three
entities,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
justice
frankfurther
also
said
when
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear,
that
we
don't
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
sometimes
when
it's
clear
we
also
look
at
the
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
added
an
officer
of
the
association,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
if
this
case
were
thrown
out
because
of
a
narrow
interpretation
of
that
sentence,
that
the
entire
purpose
of
congress
in
getting
expedited
review
of
the
constitutional
questions
would
be
thwarted.
unknown
speaker
do
you
allege
in
your
complaint,
or
did
you
prove,
that
the
individuals
for
whom
you
claim
associational
standing
are
eligible
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
but
the
need
for
allegation
may
have
arisen.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
the
members
were
eligible
to
vote,
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
action
that
they
might
have
brought
as
individuals
would
be
the
same
as
the
action
the
association
could
bring,
challenging
restrictions
in
the
statute
on
associational
activity?
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
many
challenges
in
that
case.
here
the
only
challenge
is
that
the
statute
restricts
the
activities
of
the
association,
as
i
understand
it.
and
you're
suggesting
that--
unknown
speaker
--then
how
do
you
read
the
statute?
you
say
that
listed
persons
and
anybody
else
who
might
be
adversely
affected
by
anything
in
the
statute
has
the
standing
to
make
a
challenge.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
does.
it
gives
certain
remedies
to
certain
specific
people
that
they
wouldn't
otherwise
have.
does
that
mean
that
it
gives
it
to
everybody?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
other
statutes
where
they
do,
in
fact,
say
anybody
who
suffers
injury
in
fact
has
standing,
but
they
certainly
didn't
use
that
kind
of
language
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
the
reason
in
those
cases,
those
people
couldn't
get
into
court
at
all
if
they
didn't
have
that
kind
of
standing.
but
here,
you'd
get
in
court
sooner
or
later
if
you
went
ahead
and
did
what
you
think
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do.
you
would
get
into
court.
unknown
speaker
you
might
not
be
able
to
initiate
the
action,
but
you
would
be
a
defendant
in
an
action,
which
you
could
raise
your
constitutional
challenges.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lot
of
times
that
happens.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
presumption
that
the
statute
is
valid,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
if
there
hadn't
been
the
special
appeal
provisions
and
you
just
wanted
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
if
there
was
a
case
for
controversy,
you
probably
could
have.
you
would
have
had
standing
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
only
question
here
is
whether
using
this
special
procedure
is
open
to
you.
unknown
speaker
i'll
find
out
why
they
think
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
these
statutory
restrictions
apply
only
to
solicitations
for
federal
elections,
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
limit,
of
course,
the
trade
association
from
soliciting
funds
for
other
purposes,
state
elections
or
referenda
or
matters
of
that
kind?
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
satisfied,
or
would
you
be
making
an
argument
that
a
provision
would
be
unconstitutional
of
it
put
the
trade
association
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
other
corporations?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
legality?
unknown
speaker
no
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
treating
the
trade
association
like
other
corporations
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
meant
really
to
ask
you
if
that
kind
of
a
provision
would
be
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
you
be
pretty
bad
off
if
all
you
could
do
is
to
solicit
from
your
officers
and
employees?
unknown
speaker
the
other
corporations
can
only
do
that
unless
they...
except
for
one
or
two
other
openings
a
year.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
if
congress
can
treat
trade
associations
like
they
treat
other
corporations,
do
you
think
the
present
regulation
is
much
more
severe
than
that,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
prior
to
1976,
what
could
an
association
do
in
this
respect?
it
could
solicit
funds,
but
could
it
make
contributions
in
political
campaigns?
unknown
speaker
and
subsection
(d)
is
an
exception
to
the
general
prohibition
in
441,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
solicit
funds,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
could?
unknown
speaker
even
though
corporations
and
unions
could
not?
unknown
speaker
you
could
create
pac's,
then,--
unknown
speaker
--without
limitation.
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
would
like
to
do
is
knock
subsection
(d)
out
of
the
act
entirely?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
all
of
section
(d)--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
want
all
of
subsection
(d)--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
better
off
now
than
you
were
before?
unknown
speaker
corporations
and
labor
unions
could
make
contributions
from
pac
funds
prior
to
1976.
unknown
speaker
beginning
in
1972.
unknown
speaker
was
cope
a
pac?
unknown
speaker
that
goes
back--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
1972
amendments
did
quite
a
bit
that
didn't
exist
before,
with
respect
to
corporate
contributions
and--
unknown
speaker
--counsel,
before
you
sit
down,
is
it
your
position
that
the
right
to
solicit
funds
by
the
trade
association
is
entitled
to
the
same
level
of
constitutional
protection
as
other
forms
of
political
speech,
without
any
difference?
it's
entitled
to
the
same
level
of
protection?
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
could
i
ask
you
what
you
see
as
the
interest
of
the
government
in
imposing
the
restrictions
that
it
did
on
the
solicitation
of
funds
by
trade
associations?
i
mean,
assuming
that
the
government
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
limiting
the
contributions
that
can
be
made
to
candidates
in
a
federal
election
by
corporations
or
trade
associations.
what
is
the
government's
interest
in
limiting
the
people
from
whom
solicitations
can
be
made?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
have
a
less
restrictive
requirement,
then,
of
letting
volunteers
solicit
from
anyone
as
lone
as
no
trade
association
money
was
used
for
the
purpose?
unknown
speaker
so
the
trade
association
in
your
view
could
use
volunteers
to
solicit
funds
from
anyone,
regardless
of
the
permission
that
was
granted.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
we're
really
concerned
about
just
two
things,
are
we
not;
the
limitation
that
says
you
have...
that
the
member
corporation
has
to
consent
to
the
solicitation
and
the
restriction
limiting
it
to
only
one
trade
association
per
year,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
if
the
bottom
line
that
the
congress
is
aiming
at
is
to
limit
the
contributions
and
the
use
of
these
concentrated
funds
to
influence
elections,
why
isn't
it
enough
just
to
limit
the
contributions
and
not
limit
solicitation?
why
must
you
limit
the
source
of
funds
if
you
are
going
to
limit
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
given
to
a
candidate
or
to
elections?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
just
limit
the
amount
of
money
that
the
corporate...
just
limit
the
amount
of
money
the
corporation
can
spend
on
solicitation.
why
do
you
have
to
say
from
whom
they
may
solicit?
if
all
you're
worried
about
is
how
much
of
the
corporate
funds
are
going
to
be
spent
to
support
the
pac?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that's
because
that's
the
way
it
is,
that's
all
you're
saying.
now,
what--
unknown
speaker
--i
know.
you're
just
being
descriptive.
but
i
don't
understand
yet
what
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
you
just
limited
the
amount
of
money
that
you
could
spend
for
solicitation
and
forget
about
limiting
from
whom
they
could
solicit?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
said
that
you
can
only
spend
two
cents
for
every
thousand
dollars
you
raise?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
why
do
you
have
to
go
on
and
say
and
furthermore,
you
can
only
raise
your
money
from
this
following
list
of
people?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
with
that.
of
course
they
did.
put
i
wonder
what
the
justification
is.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they're
not
going
to
raise
anymore
money
for
political
purposes
than
they
are
permitted
to
spend.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
limiting
the
sources
is
a
way
of
limiting
the
amount
of
money
that
they
can
spend?
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
is
an
indirect
way
of
limiting
political
contributions,
to
say
that
you
can
only
raise
your
money
from
x
number
of
people.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
from
certain
categories
of
people.
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
wouldn't
you
concede
that
justice
white's
suggestion
would
be
less
restrictive
than
the
actual
restriction
that
congress
imposed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
the
right
to
solicit
funds
is
entitled
to
heightened
scrutiny
by
the
court
as
a
first
amendment
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
when
were
corporations
and
labor
unions
first
limited
in
terms
of
from
whom
they
could
solicit?
unknown
speaker
what
did
that
prohibit?
it
prohibited
contributions,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
mention
solicitation,
but
of
course,
if
they
couldn't
contribute
they
wouldn't
solicit.
but
it
didn't
purport
to
limit
solicitation.
unknown
speaker
again,
when
did
the
congress
first
say
since
you
can
now
spend
some
money,
we're
going
to
limit
from
whom
you
can
solicit?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
first
time,
then,
that
they
purported
to
limit--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
there
were
pac's
before
that,
but
they
didn't
use
corporate
money
to
support
them.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
there
weren't
any
limitations
on
solicitation.
unknown
speaker
until
the
seventies--
unknown
speaker
--that
was
the
first
time
that
it
was
allowed,
that
congress
allowed
corporate
money
to
be
spent
to
solicit.
unknown
speaker
and
to
support
the
independent
fund.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
an
understandable
matter,
limiting
the
use
of
corporate
funds
to
just
soliciting
from
people
who
are
interested
in
the
corporation.
but
suppose
no
corporate
funds,
just
control.
you
say
nevertheless,
if
the
corporation
just
got
control
of
the
fund,
that
from
whom
they
solicit
may
still
be
limited.
unknown
speaker
mr.
steele,
a
different
question.
you've
argued
in
your
brief
that
the
proliferation
of
trade
associations
and
solicitations
would
undermine
the
very
purpose
of
the
restrictions,
as
you
say,
on
the
use
of
corporate
treasuries.
but
isn't
that
protected
already
under
441a(a)(5)
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
language
is
rather
explicit,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question
while
i
have
you
interrupted.
if
we
agree
with
your
437h
argument,
what
happens
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
the
plaintiff
will
be
in
a
position,
when
it
gets
back
to
the
district
court,
to
allege
and
assert
1331
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
they
can
amend.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
then
i
say
that
they
can
amend
when
they
get
back.
unknown
speaker
they
had...
trade
associations
as
corporations
then
had
a
privilege
that
other
corporations
didn't
in
terms
of
solicitation.
unknown
speaker
but,
beginning
in
the
early
seventies,
did
the
congress
specify
the
people
from
whom
corporations
could
solicit?
unknown
speaker
what
about
trade
associations?
were
your
sources
specified
or
not?
unknown
speaker
okay,
thank
you.
