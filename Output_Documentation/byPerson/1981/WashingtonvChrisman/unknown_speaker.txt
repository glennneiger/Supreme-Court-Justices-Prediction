unknown
speaker
is
the
basic
predicate
of
your
case
that
if
an
arresting
officer
has
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
does
so,
he
may
keep
the
arrested
person
at
least
in
sight
if
not
in
hand
from
that
point
on?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
return
to
the
premises
for
the
benefit
of
the
arrested
person.
unknown
speaker
from
your
point
of
view,
from
your
position,
the
officer
could
have
appropriately
walked
in
the
room
and
stayed
within
two
or
three
feet
of
this
man
at
all
times.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
if
a
man
is
arrest
out
on
the
street,
you
could
carry
him
across
town
and
go
into
his
room?
unknown
speaker
but
the
man
didn't
invite
him,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
else
could
he
do?
unknown
speaker
and
gone
to
jail.
unknown
speaker
that
was
his
choice.
it
was
either
let
the
officer
go
with
him
or
go
to
jail.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
i
gather
the
officer
had
wanted
the
id,
did
he
not,
to
find
out
his
age,
to
use
as
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
wanted
it
for
at
least
that
much,
didn't
he,
for
that
reason?
unknown
speaker
did
he
give
miranda
warnings?
unknown
speaker
shouldn't
he
have?
unknown
speaker
why,
if
he
was
going
to
use
this
as
evidence,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
he
was
going
to
use
it
as
evidence,
wasn't
he?
that's
why
he
wanted
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
think
he
should
have
been
given
miranda
warnings
and
he
didn't
have
them...
you
agree
he
didn't...
wouldn't
that
taint
everything
after
that?
unknown
speaker
well
wouldn't
it?
under
our
cases?
unknown
speaker
under
our
cases,
that
he
should
have
had
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
before
you
leave
the
point,
i'm
still
a
little
uncertain.
why
was
the
id
important?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
he
didn't
need
the
id
to
establish
that
because
the
young
man
had
admitted
he
was
19.
unknown
speaker
once
he
admitted
it,
then
why
did
he
need
the
id?
unknown
speaker
and
what
were
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
on
the
campus;
he
didn't
need
an
id
for
that.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
id
for
that
either,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
why?
if
i'm
arrested
out
on
the
street
somewhere,
do
i
have
to
have
an
id?
unknown
speaker
he
knew
his
name.
do
you
have
to
have
an
id
in
writing
in
order
to
identify
yourself?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
suggesting
that
this
man
didn't
know
his
own
name,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
he
intend
to
take
him
to
the
station?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that?
unknown
speaker
the
man
is
a
man
that
admits
he's
under
21,
with
a
half
a
gallon
of
liquor.
unknown
speaker
and
the
policeman
is
going
to
let
him
go?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
story
that
he
was
going
to
turn
him
loose?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
he
had
a
choice
of
taking
him
to
the
room
or
jail.
unknown
speaker
now
you
say
he
wasn't
going
to
take
him
to
jail;
he
was
going
to
give
him
a
slip
of
paper.
unknown
speaker
i
hope
so.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
when
he
first
encountered
this
young
man,
did
he
have
any
way
of
knowing
whether
the
young
man
was,
in
fact,
a
student?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
great
many
people
of
that
age
who
might
come
out
of
that
hall
and
have
no
connection
with
the
university.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
you
give
that
answer
to
me
when
i
asked
you
that
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
give
it
until
you
got
it
from
the
chief
justice.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
gave
it
to
him,
you
gave
it
very
clearly
in
response
to
my
question.
mr.
carpenter,
when
he
got
upstairs,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances
which
justified
his
entry
into
the
room?
unknown
speaker
and
had
there
not
been
is
the
implication
that
he
could
not
have
entered
the
room?
unknown
speaker
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get,
mr.
carpenter,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances,
he
should
not
have
entered
the
room?
unknown
speaker
and
what
are
the
exigent
circumstances,
assuming
that
there--
unknown
speaker
--now,
incidentally,
the
officer
had
a
radio,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
after
he
entered
the
room
that
he
summoned
help
on
the
radio.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
suppose
he
didn't
summon
held
while
he
was
at
the
door
where
he
could
see
everything?
unknown
speaker
he
could
see
both
the
people,
he
could
still
see
the
seeds--
unknown
speaker
--what
was
the
rationale
used
by
the
court
below
in
this
decision?
unknown
speaker
i
said
the
court
below,
the
one
immediately
below
is
the
washington
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
your
position
that
if
the
office
was
accompanying
this
young
man
down
the
hall
and
he
was
headed
from
room
b,
which
was
another
few
steps,
but
he
walked
by
room
a
and
he
glanced
into
the
room
and
saw
the
very
same
things
that
he
saw
in
this
case;
namely,
whatever
it
was
on
that
stand.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
enters
that
room,
saying
these
things
are
in
plain
view,
i
can
enter
this
room
and
seize
them
because
of
exigent
circumstances.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
no,
just
take
my
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
door
is
standing
open
and
they
are
both
walking
by,
add
all
of
a
sudden
the
officer
sees
what
he
saw
in
this
case
sitting
on
the
stand.
would
that
authorize
his
entry
into
the
room.
unknown
speaker
no,
no
occupant
at
all.
he
just
sees
on
the
stand
what
he
sees
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
my
question?
unknown
speaker
he
sees
those
seeds
standing
there...
he
sees
what
he
saw
in
this
case.
he
doesn't
really
know
they
were
seeds.
he
had
to
go
over
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
like
if
you
were
walking
by
a
house
and
looked
through
the
window
and
saw
them.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
then
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
saw
the
same
thing
through...
if
he
was
walking
by
on
the
street,
he
looked
in
the
window
and
he
saw
what
he
saw
and
he
saw
a
man
in
there
looking
nervous
and
was
about
to
destroy
them,
could
he
go
in?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
assuming
anything.
i
just
tell
you
what
he
sees.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
university
dormitory
room
necessarily
occupy
the
same
status
as
a
single
family
dwelling
or
an
apartment
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
it's
his
home,
isn't
it,
for--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
smith,
so
long
as
we're
into
hypotheticals,
suppose
we
take
justice
white's
hypothetical,
and
instead
of
seeing
some
seeds
in
this
room
with
which
he
had
no
concern...
that
is,
he
had
no
concern
about
the
room...
he
saw
a
sawed
off
shotgun.
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
he
shouldn't
do
anything
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
wanted
to
eliminate
any
idea
that
a
policeman
should
ignore
that.
or
suppose
he
saw
a
body
that
appeared
to
be
a
dead
body,
and
on
reaching
in
and
feeling
the
pulse,
thereby
violating
the
premises
to
that
extent,
he
finds
that
the
person
is
dead.
he's
certainly
going
to
do
something
about
it,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
they
see
the
evidence
of
an
unlawful,
criminal
act,
they
must
do
something,
whatever
that
something
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
premise
for
this
position
is
that
he
knew
what
he
saw.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that
he
did
know
exactly
what
he
saw.
he
didn't
have
to
go
over
and
find
out
what
was
there.
unknown
speaker
he
may
have
suspected
it,
but
did
he
really
know.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
at
that
point
let
me
ask
how
far
did
you
say,
again,
he
was?
unknown
speaker
which
is
less
than
the
distance
between
you
and
this
bench.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
my
understanding
is
that
this
respondent
was
under
arrest
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
of
washington
so
held.
unknown
speaker
and
you've
been
talking
now
for
quite
a
while,
or
responding
to
some
questions
about
situations
where
officers
looking
through
windows
and
standing
at
doorways,
as
to
what
rights
they
may
have.
i
would
think
you
would
argue
this
case
as
to
the
rights
of
an
officer
where
he
has
made
a
lawful
arrest
to
stay
with
the
party
arrested
and
to
observe
anything
that
he
could
observe
in
those
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
fact
that
this
involved
a
lawful
arrest
and
a
search
incident
to
arrest
distinguish
this
case
from
much
of
what
we've
been
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
i'm
confused
now.
i
have
heard
you
talk
about
exigent
circumstances,
i
have
heard
you
talk
about
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
and
i
think
i've
heard
you
talk
about
plain
view.
what
is
it
you're
really
relying
on?
are
you
relying
on
the
fact,
as
you
allege
it
to
be,
that
the
officer
was
in
a
place
where
he
had
a
right
to
be
and
he
saw
items,
contraband,
in
plain
view?
or
are
you
relying
on
exigent
circumstances,
or
search
lawful...
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
or
all
three
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
you
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
and
he
sees
something
in
plain
view?
i'm
still
confused
what
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
unlike
justice
o'connor,
who
has
recently
joined
our
court,
do
you
think
that
any
of
the
courts
in
the
country
or
any
prosecutor
or
any
defense
lawyer
can
be
faulted
for
being
somewhat
confused
about
the
state
of
fourth
amendment
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
on
the
question
of
exigent
circumstances,
the
chief
justice
gave
you
examples
of
seeing
a
gun
or
a
dead
body
or
something
like
that.
is
it
your
view
that
the
character
of
the
crime,
the
degree
of
violence
associated
and
so
forth
has
anything
to
do
with
the
exigent
circumstances
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
you
would
treat
this
case
involving--
unknown
speaker
--involving
the
use
of
marihuana
as
equally
as
serious
as
a
murder
or
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
it's
not
uncommon
to
find
marihuana
in
college
dorms,
either.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
are
you
familiar
with
a
case
we
decided
last
june,
i
think
the
title
of
it
was
new
york
against
belton?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
the
belton
case,
as
i
recall,
involved
an
officer
who
stopped
an
automobile
and
made
a
lawful
arrest
and
the
court
held
that
the
officer
was
entitled,
without
a
warrant,
to
search
anything
in
the
driver's
compartment
of
the
car...
passenger
compartment
of
the
car.
unknown
speaker
anything
that
he
could
find
there.
now,
the
plain
view
doctrine
certainly
applies...
i've
always
understood
it...
when
an
officer
makes
a
lawful
arrest.
why
do
you
avoid
relying
primarily
on
that
issue?
am
i
overlooking
something?
unknown
speaker
you're
trying
to
argue
three
cases
at
one
time.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
can
hang
your
hat
on
which
ever
one
you
want.
unknown
speaker
now,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
belton
case
and
this.
there
we
had
the
mobility
of
an
automobile,
which
had
a
special
character.
here
you
have
an
immobile
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
officer
might
reasonably
be
reprimanded
for
not
having
gone
in
and
followed
him
around
to
be
sure
he
wasn't
going
to
come
out
to
the
door
with
a
sawed
off
shotgun
in
his
hand.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
does
the
record
show
when
this
man
was
given
his
miranda
warning?
unknown
speaker
so
he
wasn't
given
miranda
warnings--
unknown
speaker
--until
he
was
arrested
for
the
marihuana.
unknown
speaker
he
wasn't
given
miranda
warnings
about
the
liquor.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
the
purpose
of
the
id
was
for
the
liquor.
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
get
that
idea
that
you
have
to
get
an
id
everytime
you
arrest
a
man?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
requirement
that
you
identify
yourself?
unknown
speaker
is
it
reasonable
to
take
a
man
back
to
his
home
after
you
arrest
him?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
a
right
to
go
there,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
a
right
to
accompany
him
unless--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
carpenter,
can
we
be
certain
the
washington
court
based
its
decision
on
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
rather
than
on
the
washington
constitutional
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
preamble
has
never
been
considered
part
of
the
constitution
for
adjudication
purposes,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that,
mr.
patrick,
to
negate
the
thought
that
the
policeman,
once
having
placed
this
man
under
arrest,
had
a
right,
if
not
a
duty,
to
keep
him
within
arm's
length
at
all
times
until
he
had
completed
all
the
formalities?
any
question
about
that
in
your
mind?
unknown
speaker
whose
idea
was
it
to
go
to
the
room?
the
officer's
or
the
arrested
persons's?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
ambiguous
from
the
supreme
court
of
washington
where
it
says
at
rage
35
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
"the
officer
noticed
the
bottle
of
gin
and
suspected
that
overdahl
was
under
the
age
of
21.
"
"he
stopped
overdahl
and
requested
his
identification.
"
"overdahl
stated
that
he
would
have
to
go
upstairs
to
his
room
to
get
the
identification.
"
"officer
daugherty
required
that
he
would
have
to
accompany
him
to
his
room.
"
it's
kind
of
hard
to
say
from
that
description,
isn't
it,
who...
whether
there
was
insistence
on
one
party
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
was
the
arrest
lawful,
do
you
concede,
even
though
he
had
no
miranda
rights?
unknown
speaker
it
makes
a
difference,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
point
is
that?
unknown
speaker
at
the
elevator?
was
that
near
the
elevator
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
what
point
was
he
arrested?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
lawful
arrest,
even
though
there
were
no
miranda
warnings?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
he
charged
for
just
having
liquor
on
the
campus?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
one
of
the
charges
just
being
in
possession
of
liquor
on
the
campus?
unknown
speaker
what
the
officer's
subjective
intent
was
i
don't
know
is
controlling.
he
had,
in
fact,
committed
a
violation
of
that
regulation.
unknown
speaker
and
was
that
not
a
violation
for
which
he
could
have
been
issued
a
citation
of
some
kind?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
on
page
35,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
again
says,
as
they
were
waiting
for
the
elevator,
the
officer
asked
overdahl
how
old
he
was.
overdahl
responded
that
he
was
19.
unknown
speaker
what
about
miranda
warnings?
unknown
speaker
no.
what
about
when
he
conceded,
i
am
19.
was
he
entitled
to
miranda
warnings
if--
unknown
speaker
--well,
do
you
make
any
point
of
the
fact
he
didn't
get
them?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
conceded
he
was
19,
without
the
miranda
warnings
you
suggest,
or
you
argue,
that
the
arrest
was
still
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
but
how
can
the
respondent
take
advantage
of
the
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
to
his
roommate?
unknown
speaker
the
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
doesn't
vitiate
the
arrest,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
simply
don't
follow
this
argument.
if
the
arrest
is
valid,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
gave
miranda
warnings
or
not,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
infer
that;
your
opponent
infers
something
different
on
that.
but
regardless
of
his
motive,
if
he
made
a
valid
arrest,
as
justice
powell
has
suggested,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether...
i
just
don't
follow
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
done
two
things.
he
could
have
ticketed
him
without
taking
him
to
the
station,
and
he
would
have
had
written
as
well
as
oral
proof
of
age.
unknown
speaker
granted
all
that,
still,
now
what's
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
follow.
the
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
makes
subsequent
statements
inadmissible
in
evidence.
is
there
any
doctrine
that
says
that
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
makes
it
wrong
for
a
police
officer
to
take
a
person
in
custody
to
his
room?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
evidence
is
inadmissible.
even
though
it's
not
the
person
who
was
ultimately
charged.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
this
expression
that
was
raised
by
the
chief
justice
a
little
while
back.
under
all
the
circumstances
you
say
he
comes
in
the
room
and
finds
a
loaded,
double
barreled,
sawed
off
shotgun.
unknown
speaker
but
he
wouldn't
have
seen
if,
to
quote
you,
he
hadn't
violated
the
roommate's
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
that
cut
back
on
your
point
a
little
bit?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
absolute,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
was
poison
there.
unknown
speaker
poison,
which
can
kill
just
as
easily
as
a
shotgun.
and
which
can
also
be
poured
down
the
toilet
and
disposed
of.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
window
in
the
room?
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
thrown
out
of
the
window.
unknown
speaker
no,
they
could
raise
the
window;
they
weren't
crippled,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
can
bootstrap
these
arguments.
even
if
you
admit
that
you...
if
the
prosecutor
here
admits
that
he
had
no
right
to
follow
the
man
but
he
did
follow
him,
that
he
should
have
given
him
miranda
warnings
but
he
didn't.
i
don't
see
how
that
helps
your
client.
that's
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
even
if
i
think
it
helps
the
other
guy,
i
don't
think
it
helps
your
client.
now,
does
that
make
it
clear?
unknown
speaker
which
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
right...
looking
into
an
open
door
is
the
same
as
breaking
the
door
down.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
little
bit
of
difference.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patrick,
i
wonder
if
even
that
follows.
supposing
he
lawfully
arrested
him
downstairs,
and
on
the
way
up
he
beated
him
up
in
the
elevator
and
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
and
then
said,
i
still
am
going
to
follow
you
into
the
room.
if
he
has
a
right
to
follow
him
into
the
room,
the
fact
that
he
beat
him
up
in
the
elevator
wouldn't
destroy
that
right,
would
it?
i
mean,
there
would
be
remedies
for
what
he
did,
but
i'm
not
sure
one
of
the
remedies
is
that
he
has
to
turn
him
loose.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
can
keep
him
under
arrest
and
if
you
can
stay
with
your
arrestee
and
go
into
a
room,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
if
you
did
something
else
that's
very
wrong
on
the
way
in
has
changed
the
legal
posture
at
all.
unknown
speaker
beat
him
up
in
the
elevator.
unknown
speaker
under
the
theory,
at
least
the
one
justice
powell
has
been
suggesting,
he
didn't
need
consent.
he
had
the
man
under
arrest,
and
the
man
goes
in
the
room,
he
has
a
right
to
follow
him
in.
and
i'm
just
suggesting
that
he
doesn't
lose
that
right
because
he
did
something
terrible
in
the
elevator;
if
he
has
the
right.
unknown
speaker
but
see,
it
you
have
the
arrest
situation,
then
you
don't
need
the
consent.
unknown
speaker
i
see
what
you're
saying.
one
more
hypothetical.
he
does
everything
you
say
to
one
of
the
men,
and
as
he
gets
to
the
door,
the
wind
blows
the
door
open
and
he
sees
all
of
that.
he
can't
seize
it.
do
you
want
to
bet?
unknown
speaker
yes.
just
as
he
got
there.
fortuitous
wind.
unknown
speaker
well
the
police
officer
employed
by
the
university
sure
had
a
right
to
be
standing
in
that
hallway.
unknown
speaker
and
the
door
blew
open,
on
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
but
the
chief
justice
says
you
might
have
to
get
a
warrant,
but
you
said
he
doesn't
even
have
to
get
one.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
you
just
said
that
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
the
officer
could
do
it.
but
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
does
not
vitiate
an
otherwise
lawful
arrest,
does
it?
it
just
means
that
a
motion
to
suppress
may
be
granted,
but
we'll
suppress
items
that
were
surrendered
by
the
victim
under
the...
because
of
the
failure
to
advise
him
of
his
rights.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
can't
prove
its
case
by
other
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
but
this
isn't
the
same
individual.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
patrick,
assuming
there
is
no
infirmity
whatever
in
the
arrest
of
overdahl
and
they
went
up
to
the
room,
as
they
did,
might
not...
or
do
you
think
the
officer
could
accompany
overdahl
into
the
room?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
suggested
them.
if
there
is
no
infirmity
whatever
in
the
arrest
of
overdahl.
you
go
up
to
the
room
because
overdahl
has
said,
i
want
to
get
the
id
for
you.
could
not
the
officer
accompany
him
into
the
room?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
and
why
not,
if
you're
going
to
answer
he
couldn't?
i
would
suppose
the
officer
would
be
able
to
be
sure
that
he
wasn't
going
to
be
attacked
or
assaulted.
unknown
speaker
because
he
stood
in
the
doorway
instead
of
entering,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
let's
suppose,
however,
that
he
had
entered.
would
there
be
anything
wrongful
about
that
entry?
unknown
speaker
yes.
if
he
had
gone
in
with
overdahl.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
washington
supreme
court
decided
this
case
under
the
washington
constitution,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
they
rested
this
on
the
state
constitution
rather
than
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
if
they
did,
we
would
have
no
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
obviously.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
they
did?
unknown
speaker
why
did
the
state
supreme
court
cite
all
the
federal
constitutional
cases
if
it
was
deciding
it
under
the
washington
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but
we're
reviewing
a
judgment
here
that's
not
in
the
future
but
was
rendered
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
test
whether
it
did
decide
it
rather
than
whether
it
could
have
decided
it,
under
privda
and
minnesota
vs.
national
tea
and
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
this
business
of
deciding
cases
on
state
constitutional
principles
rather
than
federal
is
nothing
new.
we've
been
doing
it
up
here
for
a
long
time.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patrick,
on
that
point,
did
you
tell
us...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
what
you
were
saying...
that
there
is
a
state
constitutional
doctrine
that
more
or
less
classifies
certain
offenses
as
very
petty
offenses
and
that
if
this
offense
is
in
that
category,
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
entry
into
the
room
might
not
have
been
justified
by
the
fact
that
the
man
was
under
arrest.
unknown
speaker
that's
in
the...
is
that
the
daugherty
case
the
courts
have
found
that--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
holding
in
this
case,
i
see,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patrick,
may
i
review
with
you
just
a
moment
to
be
clear,
are
you
now
willing
to
concede
that
mr.
overdahl
had
been
lawfully
arrested
before
the
officer
accompanied
him
to
his
room?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
concede
that
the
officer
was
lawfully
at
the
doorway
of
the
room
with
mr.
overdahl?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
concede
there
are
circumstances
which
would
justify
an
officer
in
accompanying
the
person
arrested
to
his
dwelling,
into
the
dwelling.
unknown
speaker
well,
ker
in
california
held
that
the
knock
and
announce
rule
was
not
a
constitutional
rule,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
the
dissent
said
in
ker
and
california.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
opinion
can
be
read
as
resting
on
your
statement?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's
even
ambiguous--
unknown
speaker
--an
open
container
of
gin?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
gin.
unknown
speaker
however
old
you
are.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
what
about--
--that
isn't
old.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
about
mr.
patrick's
suggestion
that
there
are
certain
very
minor
offenses
with
respect
to
which
when
an
arrest
is
made,
the
arresting
officer
could
not
follow
the
man
into
the
room?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
opinions
last
spring,
justice
stewart
referred
to
custodial
arrests.
do
you
remember
that
in
one
of
the
cases?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
was
kind
of
nonsensical?
unknown
speaker
so
your
view
would
be
all
arrests
are
considered--
unknown
speaker
--until
you
get
on
bail.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
