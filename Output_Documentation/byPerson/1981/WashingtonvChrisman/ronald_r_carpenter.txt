mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
matter,
the
state,
feels
there
are
three
principal
issues
which
the
petitioner
feels
necessary
to
discuss
in
detail.
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
exigent
circumstances
existed
in
this
case
that
would
have
excused
the
officer
of
first
procuring
a
search
warrant
prior
to
his
entry
into
the
dorm
room
and
seizure
of
the
marihuana
seeds.
secondly,
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
for
the
law
enforcement
officer
to
accompany
the
arrestee,
mr.
overdahl,
to
the
dorm
room
when
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
that
premises
to
secure
id
from
the
premises.
and
thirdly,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
the
officer
acted
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
on
the
first
two
questions,
whether
or
not
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
to
be
applied
to.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
the
court
should
look
at
the
good
faith
of
the
officer
in
this
particular
case
and
apply
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
approach
is
that
in
order
to
protect
both
the
officer
and
protect
other
members
of
society,
protect
the
arrestee
himself
and
protect
the
evidence
from
being
destroyed,
it
is
nonsensical
to
suggest
that
the
officer
should
allow
the
arrestee
out
of
his
immediate
control
and
presence.
and
in
order
to
that,
if
he
wants
to
be
a
reasonable,
polite,
courteous
officer,
wants
to
do
what
this
officer
tried
to
do,
try
to
conduct
himself
in
a
low
key,
professional
manner
particularly
on
a
college
campus,
he
needed
to
afford
the
arrestee
the
opportunity
to
return
to
his
premises,
and
that's
basically
what
we're
saying.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
correct,
it
was
to
expedite
the
release
of
the
arrested
person,
mr.
overdahl.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no.
i'm
not
saying
that.
only
if
he
requests
to
return
to
his
premises.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well
no,
that's
not
really
true.
the
officer
asked
for
id
and
the
individual
indicated,
mr.
overdahl
indicated
that
he
did
not
have
id.
he
asked
the
officer
if
he
could
return
to
the
premises.
the
officer
indicated
well,
in
light
of
your
custodial
status
i
can't
let
you
return
to
the
premises
unless
i
accompany
you,
and
mr.
overdahl
said
okay.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
he
could
have
said
no,
that's
not
okay.
take
me
down
to
the
station
house
and
book
me,
handcuff
me.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
and
gone
to
jail.
the
officer
was
trying
to
allow
him
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--that's
right.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
that's
part
of
the
reason
he
wanted
an
id,
but
you
have
to
remember--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--well,
that's
true.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
there
were
three
reasons.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
that
may
have
been
a
collateral
reason.
but
the
principal
reason
he
needed
it,
anytime
you
arrest
an
individual
you
have
to
id
that
person.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--not
necessarily,
because--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--well,
what
would
be
mr.
chrisman's
standing
to
complain
about
mr.
overdahl's
violation
of
his
miranda
rights?
that
would
be
my
answer.
plus,
the
officer
had
a
right
to
be
out
in
that
public
hallway,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he
asked
for
his
age.
the
dorm
room
and
public
hallway
of
orton
hall
was
public
area;
it
constitutes
an
unprotected
area,
he
had
a
right
to
be
there.
and
that's
where
he
saw
the
principal
observations
before
he
went
in
under
what
we
say
was
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
you
have
to
remember...
and
you
can
look
at
pages
7,
9
and
10
of
the
joint
appendix
and
read
through
those
pages,
and
you
will
see
that
the
officer
had
three
violations
he
was
aware
of.
he
was
aware
of
a
violation
of
being
in
possession
of
alcohol
and
in
violation
of
a
washington
statute,
not
being
21
years
of
age.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
at
the
elevator
before
they
ascended
to
the
11th
floor.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
because
he
has
two
other
violations.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
one
was
a
violation
of
the
washington
administrative
code
which
prohibits
from
having
alcohol
on
the
campus--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--and
the
third
one
would
be
he
had
an
open
container
of
alcohol,
another
criminal
violation.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
you
need
it...
i
would
gently
suggest
that
you
need
an
id
anytime
you
arrest
a
person.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well
sooner
or
later,
when
you
get
booked
in
you
are
going
to
have
to
identify
yourself,
aren't
you?
are
we
going
to
book
him
in
as
a
john
doe
and
hold--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--well,
in
1978
there
were
approximately
16,000
students
on
wsu
campus.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
rather
foolhardy
for
an
officer
to
take
his
word
as
to
what
his
name
was.
there
are
a
lot
of
students
on
that
campus.
we
see
a
lot
of
john
smith's.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
no,
he
was
trying
to
allow
him
to
be
released.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
right,
a
half
a
gallon
of
gin.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
he
would
issue--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--he
would
issue
him
a
uniform
citation--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--sure,
he
would
issue
him
a
uniform
citation
for
a
minor
violation
and
then
he
would
have
to
appear
in
district
court.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
right,
if
you
don't
furnish
some
id,
you're
going
to
jail.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
let
me
back
up
an
explain.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
his
choices
are
that
if
i
can't
resolve
this
with
some
adequate
id
so
i
can
identify
you
and
issue
you
a
uniform
citation
so
you
can
appear
in
seven
days
in
whitman
county
district
court
to
answer
the
criminal
charge
of
minor
possession...
it's
not
something
that
they
routinely
book
people
for--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--no.
other
than
that
he
came
out
of
orton
hall,
he
appeared
to
be
very
young,
appeared
to
be
obviously
under
21.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
sure.
he
has
no
idea.
as
you
remember,
mr.
overdahl
suggested
that
he
be
allowed
to
return
without
the
officer,
and
i
think
it
would
be
rather
naive
to
think
that
a
young
man
disappears...
now
maybe
this
young
man
would
have
come
back,
but
i
would
suspect
good
police
procedure
would
lead
one
to
be
a
little
cautious
about
letting
a
man
on
a
campus
with
16,000
disappear
in
the
dorm.
i
doubt
he'd
ever
come
back.
i
mean,
that's
just
my
personal
reaction.
if
i
was
a
law
enforcement
officer
i
wouldn't
let
him
out
of
my
sight.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i
thought
i
did,
but
i--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--i
apologize.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
right.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
i--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--i
believe
he
could
have
entered
on
either
one
of
the
state's
principal
theories.
either
as...
you
have
to
remember,
he
was
only
at
the
doorway
35
to
45
seconds.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
that
is
not
my
position.
i
believe
there
are
two
ways
he
could
have
entered
that
room.
one,
to
accompany
the
arrestee,
and
i
argue
in
the
brief
that
if
it
is
not
a
simultaneous
entry,
it's
a
contemporaneous
entry.
i
think
it's...
35
seconds
while
he's
standing
there
and
then
walks
in.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
he
paused
at
the
door
for
30
to
45
seconds
is
not
a
great
deal
of
constitutional
significance.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
okay.
the
state
could
argue
that
the
exigent
circumstances
in
this
particular
case
are
simply
that
if
the
officer
had
left,
the
tray
of
marihuana
seeds
which
he
observed
approximately
eight
feet
in
the
room
from
where
he
was
standing
would
have
i
think
clearly
been
gone
when
he
came
back.
or
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
they
would
have
been
gone.
there
were
two
people
in
the
room;
they
could
have
eaten
them,
they
could
have
hidden
them
in
body
cavities,
they
could
have
thrown
them
out
the
window,
and
i
won't
speculate
what
the
dispersion
pattern
from
the
11th
floor
of
marihuana
seeds
if
you
flip
them
out
the
window.
but
i
think
it's
reasonable,
as
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
concluded,
that
it
was
not
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
leave
that
room
to
get
warrant.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
he
could
have
summoned
lieutenant
kenny--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--then
we'd
have
two
officers
standing
at
the
door
if
he
can't
enter.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
which
court?
the
washington
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
trial
court?
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
oh,
excuse
me.
their
rationale
was
one
that
we
never...
that
there
were
not
exigent
circumstances
and
we
didn't
argue
them,
which
is
clearly
erroneous
because
the
record
is
replete
from
our
trial
memorandum
that
we
argued
exigent
circumstances.
the
other
was
simply
that
new
york
vs.
payton
and
reddy
prohibited
entry
without
a
warrant.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
everything
from
that
point
forward
proceeds
the
same?
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
you
have
to
remember
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--well,
are
the
facts
the
same?
i
mean,
in
this
case
mr.
overdahl
opened
the
door
all
the
way.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
and
he
sees
the
occupant
who
responds
to
him?
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
there's
a
lot
more
here.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
okay,
he
walks
by
an
open
room
and
he
sees
the
seeds.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
assuming
no
one
associated
with
the
room
or
otherwise
sees
the
officer
and
knows
he
has
seen
something,
no,
there
wouldn't
be.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
right,
you
need
a
warrant.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
but
here
there
is
an
appreciable
distinction.
here,
he
looks
in
that
room,
sees
the
contraband
in
plain
view
or
open
view
i
guess
is
the
terminology
we
use--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--he
sees
a
nervous
reaction
of
mr.
chrisman,
he
sees
mr.
chrisman
moving
the
box
around
to
the
medicine
cabinet,
and
then
when
he
sees
the
officer
in
uniform
gets
all
nervous
and
moves
it
back.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
assuming
that...
are
you
assuming,
justice,
that--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--well,
if
it's
apparent
the
man
realizes
the
officer
has
seen
it,
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well
i'd
like
to
say
it
doesn't,
but
i
think
it
probably
does,
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
premises,
a
living
quarters,
like--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--it
is
his
home
for
all
practical
purposes.
i
would
like
to
say
it
isn't,
but
i
think,
to
be
candid,
sure
it
does.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i'm
not
telling
you
that.
i
think,
chief
justice,
he
clearly
should.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
one
would
hope.
i
would
think
he
should
be
suspended
or
fired
if
he
didn't
do
something.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
it's
correct
police
procedure.
i
don't
think
the
fourth
amendment
requires
officers
to
disregard
things.
and
all
the
state's
position
is
on
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
that
there
were,
in
fact,
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
with
the
additional
that
when
the
occupant
or
occupants
of
the
premises
appreciate
the
officer's...
the
word
is
out,
so
to
speak,
the
know
the
thing
is
up,
if
the
officer
leaves
i
just
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
expect
under
the
fourth
amendment
that--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
believed
that.
they
believe
there
was
a
reasonable
basis--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--no,
no,
i
think--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--the
respondent
tries
to
argue,
mr.
justice,
that--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--okay,
he's
8
to
10
feed
from
the
doorjamb
to
the
black
tray
with
the
marihuana
seeds
and--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--that's
right.
and
this
is
an
experienced
officer,
trained
and
experienced
in
controlled
substances.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
from
reading
the
record
that
the
officer
knew
and
believed
that
he
had
probable
cause
that
it
was
marihuana.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i
think
that's
correct,
justice.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i
think
that's
correct,
and
that's
the
second
principal
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
this
case
can
be
decided
either
on
the
first
issue
or
the
second
issue.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
yes,
justice
o'connor,
unfortunately,
the
last
court
before
this
court,
the
washington
supreme
court...
and
not
to
criticize
that
court,
but
i
think
it
improperly
labeled
where
the
officer
was
as
a
nicety,
and
they
said
we're
not
going
to
decide
that
issue.
i
think
it's
pretty
important.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
our
position
is...
and
i
suppose
the
prosecutor
wants
the
best
of
both
worlds...
i
think
we
can
rely
on
both
the
exigent
circumstances;
one,
what
he
saw
in
open
view
while
he
was
standing
out
in
a
public
place
and
the
occupant's
reaction
to
him;
and
two,
that
he
had
a
right,
regardless
of
that,
to
accompany
the
arrestee
into
the
premises
to
start
with.
and
so,
pursuant
to
the
arrest
status,
for
his
protection,
the
protection
of
the
public,
the
protection
of
the
evidence,
protection
of
veracity,
so
i
think
i'm
arguing
that
we
have
the
best
of
both
worlds.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
i
guess
the
first
argument
is
in
open
view,
he
sees
it,
it's
in
a
public
place,
that's
exigent
circumstances.
now
even
setting
that
aside,
i
think
that...
the
state
would
like
to
believe
that
answers
the
issue.
but
setting
that
aside
and
forgetting
about
exigent
circumstances
for
a
moment,
we
also
would
argue
that
if
he
was,
in
fact,
in
the
room,
or
when
in
the
room
to
accompany
the
arrestee,
once
he
got
in
the
room,
it's
in
plain
view,
clearly
he
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
room,
attendant
to
the
arrest
status
of
mr.
overdahl,
and
that
it
comes
under,
you
know,
proper
police
procedure
to
accompany
mr.
overdahl
in
that
room,
and
what
he
sees
there
is
in
plain
view.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
i've
been
practicing
law
for
ten
years,
and
the
cops
always
call
me
up
at
3:00
in
the
morning
and
want
me
to
give
them
a
precise
answer
to
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
can't
do
it.
i
think
it's
so
enamored
with
constitutional
subtleties
and
what
i
like
to
call
the
crafting
of
legal
technicians
that
we've
totally
confused
not
only
the
lawyers
and
the
judges,
but
the
police
officers
who
are
supposed
to
be
constitutional
lawyers
out
in
the
street
and
making
a
15-second
decision
to
decide
what
the
u.s.
constitution
means.
all
i'm
saying
in
this
case
is
that
the
conduct
was
reasonable.
the
officer
did
what
was
reasonable
under
the
status
of
the
law
clearly
in
1978,
in
any
event.
that
was
before
mincey
vs.
arizona
and
before
payton.
it's
a
very
confusing
area.
this
case
is
important
maybe
to
clarify
what...
first
of
all,
what
is
an
exigent
circumstance.
i,
for
the
life
of
me,
could
not
find
a
real
good
u.s.
supreme
court
case
that
clearly
found
an
exigent;
i
found
a
lot
that
said
it
wasn't
and
said
what
you
should
be
looking
for.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
i
don't--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--i
don't
prescribe
to
the
theory
that
it
has
to
be
a
serious
crime--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--and
particularly
when
we
get
into
the
second
issue
in
this
case
about
arrest,
i
just
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
say
a
officer
can
only
take
reasonable
precautions
to
protect
himself
when
it's
a
serious
offense.
it's
not
uncommon
for
officers
to
be
shot
on
a
minor
traffic
stop.
all
kinds
of
minor
things.
as
the
amicus
points
out
in
their
brief,
arrest
status
sort
of
brings
out
the
worst
in
some
people,
and
in
the
most
low
key
looking
situation,
an
officer
may
find
himself
in
a
very
precarious
position.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
oh,
no,
very
common.
it's
a
way
of
life
at
wsu,
i
believe.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
yes,
i
am.
and
i
think
you
decided
robbins
or
something
like
that
the
same
day.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
right.
and
i
believe
that
case
made--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--i
excuse
myself.
i
don't
mean
to...
i
guess
like
i
said,
i'm
trying
to
have
the
best
of
both
worlds.
i
think
this
case
can
be
decided
on
both
issues.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
i
suppose
if
you
can
find
three
ways
to
hang
your
hat
on
it,
i...
you
know,
in
washington
state,
the
prosecutor
loses
80
%
of
the
time
on
all
issues
before
the
washington
supreme
court
in
the
last
two
or
three
years,
so
we
try
to
cover
the
issues.
we
try
to
find
some
way
to
sustain
our--
[laughter]
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i'd
like
to
have
my
convictions
sustained.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
but
the
language
i
find
particular
significant
maybe
to
this
case
and
belton
and
maybe
the
robinson
and
gustafson
cases,
are
the
court's
observations
that
arrested
people
are
very
unpredictable.
you
know,
an
officer
has
to
do
enough
to
protect
himself.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i
would
not
have
done
what
this
officer
did.
i
would
have
gone
in
immediately.
because
if
you
look
at
the
record
you
will
see
that
the
young
man
gets
into
a
drawer
or
a
closet
or
something.
who
knows
there's
not
a
pistol
or
something
in
there?
i
just
think
that
he
should
have
done
a
little
more
to
protect
himself
than
he
did,
but
like
i
said,
they're
trying
to
act
low
key
on
the
campus.
they
don't
want
to
get
a
lot
of
bad
publicity.
that's
pretty
clear
from
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
okay,
he
was
first
given
his
miranda
warnings
after
the
officer
seized
the
tray
of
marihuana.
at
that
point,
he
gave
both
the
occupants
their
miranda
warnings,
and
at
that
juncture
asked
if
there
was
anything
else
in
the
room,
and
at
that
point
mr.
chrisman
went
ahead
and
volunteered
the
little
box
the
officer
had
seen
him
carrying
around.
it
had
$112
and
some
marihuana
in
it.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
not
prior
to
the
entry.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
the
purpose
of
the
id,
the
state
would
like
to
say
is
that
you
have
to
id
anybody
that
you
arrest.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
i
believe
it's
correct
police
procedure.
you
have
to
ultimately
book
them
under
a
name,
and
you
have
to
verify
them,
and
when
you
have...
we
do
have
a
problem
with
people
even
appearing
in
our
district
court
under
phony
names.
i
prosecuted
a
couple
young
men
a
couple
months
ago
on
just
that.
they
went
clear
through
the
conviction
stage
using
a
phony
name.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
i
think
it's
reasonable
for
an
officer
to
ask
them;
i
don't
know
if
you
can
force
somebody
to
identify
himself,
but
i
think
it's
reasonable
police
procedure--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--if
he
wishes
to
go,
whether
it's
for
a
coat
or
drugs
or
id,
you
know,
prescription
medicine,
why
ever
he
wants
to
go
back.
i
think
it's
the
humane
thing
to
do.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
i
think
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
go
home,
either,
unless
he
allows
you
to
accompany
him.
and
if
he
says
okay,
i
want
to
go
back--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--that's
right,
that's
our
argument.
it
seems
that
if
he's
going
to
go
back,
then
he
has
to
have
a
modified
right
there.
it's
not
reasonable
to
let
him
go
back
by
himself.
at
least,
that's
the
state's
position.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
justice
o'connor,
that's
one
issue
the
respondent
argues
in
their
brief,
and,
of
course,
we
argue
that
there's
absolutely
no
discussion
of
article
i,
section
7
in
the
washington
state
constitution
in
our
decision.
they
talk
about
the
fourth
amendment
and
they
talk
about
payton
and
rettig,
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
that's
what
they
decided
the
case
on.
now,
looking
at
the
simpson
case
cited
by
the
respondent,
we
argue
that's
really
just
a
limited
case
on
standing
in
response
to
this
court's
case
racus.
looking
at,
i
think
it's
state
vs.
smith,
it's
in
my
reply
brief,
the
court
clearly
a
couple
years
ago
in
washington
said
that
the
two
sections,
article
i,
section
7
of
the
washington
constitution
and
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
u.s.
constitution
should
be
substantially
interpreted
the
same.
and
so,
it's
the
state's
position
that
they
should
be,
and
that's
what
was
done.
i
think
it's
mere
speculation
on
respondent's
part
that
it
could
have
been.
whether
it
could
or
couldn't,
it
doesn't
appear
that
they
ever
talked
about
the
washington
state
constitution
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--which,
the
chrisman
opinion?
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
i
believe
it
cannot.
and
i
particularly
believe
it
cannot
because
of
state
v.
smith.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
ambiguous.
it's
true
that
it
did
cite
a
state
case,
state
v.
daugherty,
which
cites
a
whole
series
of
other
state
cases,
but
those
state
cases
are
talking
about
interpretation
of
the
u.s.
constitution
primarily;
they're
not
talking
about
the
u.s.
constitution.
the
only
case
of
recent
times
that
is
helpful
to
underline
any
disparity
in
the
two
constitutions
is
state
v.
simpson
which
talks
about
the
standing
problem.
state
v.
smith
decided
in
1977
clearly
makes
the
point
that
the
two
constitutional
provisions
should
be
given
the
same
effect.
and
it's
only
that
point
of
departure
on
standing
that
our
court
made
a
difference.
i
think
the
record
is
helpful
in
some
of
the
things
we've
been
talking
about.
i'd
ask
the
court
when
it
has
a
chance
to
look
at
the
joint
appendix
page
35,
and
i
think
that
clearly
shows
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact,
which
show
that
it
was
mr.
overdahl's
desire
to
go
back
to
the
room,
and
that
his
response
to
the
office
was
okay,
he
could
accompany
him.
also,
a
fact
that
got
maybe
lost
in
the
wash
a
little
bit
here
is
that
the
third
violation,
also
a
criminal
violation,
was
that...
and
it's
replete
in
the
joint
appendix
references...
is
that
it's
a
violation
of
criminal
law
and
washington
law
to
have
an
open
container
out
in
public,
and
that's
another
reason
the
officer
could
have
arrested
him,
and
one
of
the
reasons
he
cites
at
the
suppression
hearing
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
of
alcoholic
beverage.
the
gin--
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
--yes.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
however
old
you
are,
if
you're
65
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
i
didn't
imply
it
was
old.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
no,
i
don't
subscribe
to
that
theory
and
i
don't
think
our
court
said
that.
i
think
our
court
just
felt
that
the
u.s.
constitution
required...
i
think
they
may
have
thought
in
their
principal
opinion
that
the
u.s.
constitution
made
some
distinction
between
serious
and
non
serious
cases.
i
think
that
is
sort
of
ludicrous
because
the
officer
is
threatened,
his
protection
is
just
as
much
at
stake.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
yes,
i
remember.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
well,
let
me
just
say
it
this
way
in
the
most
diplomatic
way
i
can,
i
think
that
it
is
unrealistic
to
say
that
officers
have
to
articulate
some
specific
threat
to
them.
because
by
the
time
they
find
out
about
the
threat,
they
are
probably
either
going
to
be
dead
or
severely
injured.
maybe
that's
a
very
callous
look
at
society,
but
we
have
some
bizarre
things
going
on
in
today's
society.
it's
not
the
peaceful
society
of
200
years
ago.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
all
arrests.
there's
jeopardy,
as
the
amicus
points
out
in
their
brief,
in
all
arrests.
mr.
ronald
r.
carpenter
that's
correct.
the
other
thing
is
i
really
don't
think
this
miranda
issue,
the
question
at
the
elevator...
i
would
suggest
is
somewhat
of
a
red
herring.
you
have
to
remember
that
they
were
already
going
back
to
the
room
to
get
id
when
he
asked
him
about
his
age
and
he
said
it
was
19.
now,
what
effect
does
the
fact
that
he
may
have
violated
his
miranda
rights
at
that
point?
they
were
still
going
back
to
the
room,
that's
where
they
started,
that's
where
they
were
headed
when
they
went
into
the
elevator
and
ascended
to
the
11th
floor.
so
it
doesn't
add
or
subtract
anything.
he
was
never
prosecuted,
the
state
never
attempted
to
use
that
statement
against
him
for
any
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
it
just
doesn't
naturally
follow
that
that
somehow
affects
the
arrest
in
this
case.
as
the
court
of
appeals
aptly
observed
on
page
24
through
26
of
our
petition
for
certiorari,
the
section
where
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
that,
and
they
say
it's
just
of
no
constitutional
significance.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
