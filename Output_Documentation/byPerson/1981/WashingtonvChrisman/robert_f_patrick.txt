mr.
robert
f.
patrick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
this
case
is
to
be
decided
on
federal
constitutional
grounds,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
a
fundamental
precept
of
the
constitution,
that
possibly
this
case
should
be
considered
in
conjunction
with
or
determined,
is
a
portion
of
the
constitution
which
is
seldom
cited
and
neither
counsel
has
cited,
frankly,
but
seldom
cited
because
it's
part
of
the
preamble,
and
that
part
of
the
preamble
says
"to
secure
the
blessings
of
our
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity.
"
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
no,
your
honor,
no,
it
has
not.
but
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
in
part
to
give
rise
or
life
to
that
portion
of
the
preamble;
that
is,
"to
secure
the
blessing
of
liberty.
"
and
part
of
the
blessing
of
liberty
would
be
the
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
have
to
say
to
your
honor
that
it
is
my
judgment
that
the
police
officer
probably
had,
as
long
as
he
had
placed
the
individual
under
arrest,
that
the
police
officer
could
be
with
him
as
he
went
wherever
this
individual
went.
i
do
not
believe,
however,
that
the
police
officer
had
the
right
to
accompany
this...
to
have
this
individual
go
to
his
room
to
secure
the
identification.
i
also
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
police
officer
did
not
have
the
right
to
accompany
him
specifically
into
the
room--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
believe
it
was,
in
essence,
the
officer
because
the
officer
left
the
individual
no
choice.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
not
from
our
standpoint,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
the
insistence
was
for
id,
and
the
officer
wanted
that
id.
not
having
advised
mr.
overdahl
of
his
miranda
rights,
he
did
not
have
the
right
to
insist
on
id.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
your
honor,
i'll
be
frank
with
you
in
this.
i
have
vacillated
back
and
forth
in
my
own
mind
on
it.
the
officer--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--the
officer...
i
believe
at
that
point,
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
the
point
where
the
police
officer
said,
i
will
have
to
go
with
you
to
the
room--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--yes.
he
was
in
the
lobby.
he
motioned
mr.
overdahl
over
and
he
said,
i'll
have
to
see
some
id
for
that
gin,
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
overdahl
then
i
said
i
don't
have
it
with
me,
i'll
have
to
go
up
to
my
room
and
get
it.
if
you'll
wait
for
me,
i'll
bring
it
back.
and
the
officer
said
no,
under
these
circumstances
i
will
have
to
go
with
you.
and
later
on
during
cross
examination--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
believe
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
no,
i
do
not
believe
at
that
point
that
the
arrest
was
lawful,
your
honor,
because
the
police
officer
at
that
point
knew
that
he
could
not
get
past
basically
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
trial
if
all
he
came
before
the
judge
was...
if
all
he
brought
before
the
judge...
was
i've
arrested
this
individual
and
this
individual
looks
like
he's
under
21,
to
me.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
that
was
in
violation
of
a
washington
administrative
code,
your
honor,
but
the
police
officer
indicated
that
he
would
not
have
arrested
that
individual,
in
essence,
for
that;
there
would
be
no
criminal
actions.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
of
the
washington
administrative
code
apparently,
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
he
could
have...
frankly,
i'm
not
really
sure
that
he
could
be
issued
a
citation.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i'm
not
really
sure
that
he
could
be
issued
a
citation
as
such.
he
would
certainly
go
to...
it
would
go
to
the
office
of
the
dean
of
students,
and
there
would
have
been
initiated...
i
do
not
believe
there
would
have
been
initiated
any
criminal
sanctions
for
that.
they
would
have
gone
to
the
dean
of
students
and
he
may
have
been
disciplined
through
whatever
university
disciplinary
procedures.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes.
at
that
point
i
believe
he
now
had
the
probable
cause
to
arrest.
but
i
believe
that
the
custody
of
mr.
overdahl--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
believe
the
custody
of
mr.
overdahl--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--yes,
your
honor,
he
was
entitled
to
the
miranda
warnings.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
arguing
that
when
the
officer
said,
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
room,
that
he
now
had
put...
he
had
so
restricted
mr.
overdahl's
freedom
of
movement
that
he
was
now
under
arrest.
and
at
that
time
he
had
a
duty
to
advise
mr.
overdahl
of
his
rights
under
miranda.
i
believe
it
happens
that
that
arrest
may--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--because
it
is
the--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--but
that's
what
led
directly
to...
as
indicated
in
our
brief,
that's
what
led
directly
to
the
opening
of
the
door,
which
was
a
giving
up
of
the
right
of
privacy
to
the
room.
and
under...
then
that
brings
into
play
bumper
and,
i
believe,
crewes
that--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
believe
that...
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does
because
he
wanted
to
get
that
id
for
proof
of
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
the
reason
that
it
becomes
important,
your
honor,
is
that
the
sole
reason
for
going
to
that
room
was
for
identification.
the
identification
would
have--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--yes.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
believe
that
at
that
point,
not
having
advised
him
of
his
rights
to
miranda,
he
did
not
have
a
right
to,
in
essence,
insist
that
the
individual
goes
to
his
room,
or
even,
there
was
no
need
for
the
individual
to
go
to
his
room.
and
i
believe
that
the
police
officer
then
took
advantage
of
the
situation
to
get
the
individual
to
his
room.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes,
your
honor,
when
going
to
the
room
is
to
obtain
that
evidence.
i
believe
that
having
put
the
individual
under
arrest,
having
failed
to
advise
the
individual
of
the
rights
under
miranda--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--yes,
the
concept,
from
my
view
anyway,
your
honor,
the
concept
is
that
the
police
officer
could
not
have
stood
outside
the
door
and
beaten
mr.
overdahl
to
a
pulp
and
said
open
the
door,
and
mr.
overdahl
finally
opens
the
door.
i
believe
that
mr.
chrisman
could
argue
and
just
as
effectively
would
have
standing
to
assert
the
manner
in
which
that
door
was
opened.
because
his
privacy
to
the
room
was
invaded
because
of
a
violation
of
his
co
tenant's
right
to
privacy.
i
believe
that's
in
essence
what
bumper
ruled
when
the
mother
allowed
the
police
officer
to
come
in.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
believe,
your
honor,
at
that
juncture
there
is,
in
fact,
i
believe,
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
item;
not...
at
that
point
the
officer
is
at
least
is
interested
in
his
personal
safety
and
the
personal
safety
of
the
people
around
as
he
would
be
evidence.
and
i
believe
that
the
sawed
off
shotgun
could
just
as
easily
be
confiscated
under
exigent
circumstances--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--that
is
correct,
that
assumes
that
he
is
properly
at
the
door.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
he
would
have
a
better
case
to
go
in
to
seize
it
for
his
own
protection.
but
still
and
all,
it
was
there
because
of
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
in
this
case,
there
was
no
toilet
in
the
room,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
there
was
a
window
in
the
room.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes,
if
they
wanted
to
break
the
window.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
believe
at
that
point,
once
the
window
was
raised--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--your
honor,--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--yes,
your
honor,
but
as
i
indicated,
i
believe
that
the
police
officer,
as
far
as
my
client,
mr.
chrisman,
is
concerned,
if
the
police
officer
secured
the
opening
of
the
door
by
beating
up
on
mr.
overdahl
until
he
finally,
through
an
act
of
submission,
opened
the
door,--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--no,
but
the
principle
i
think
is
going
to
be
the
same.
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
should
give
the
co
tenant
the
right
to
object
to
the
manner
in
which
the
privacy
was
given
up.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
for
constitutional--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--well,
your
honor,
if
you--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
don't
believe
he
has
to
turn
him
loose,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
he
can--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
think
that
if
you
fail...
if
you
violate
the
individual's
rights
and
in
violating
those
rights
of
that
individual,
the
constitutional
rights
of
that
individual--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--right,
your
honor.
if
that
goes
to
the
validity
of
the
consent
to
go
to
the
room--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--you
may
be
right,
your
honor,
unless
it
goes
to
the
consent
of
the
individual
to
go
to
the
room,
and
then
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
proposition--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--except
that,
your
honor,
just
simply
because
an
individual
is
under
arrest
doesn't
mean
that
the
police
officer
has
to
take
him
to
the
room.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
where
the
wind
has
blown
the
door
open?
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
think
that's
a
fortuitous
event
all
right,
your
honor,
but
constitutionally...
well
again,
we
go
back
to
the
proposition...
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
proposition
that
the
police
officer
was
there
because,
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
he
had
not
adequately
advised
the
individual
of
his
rights
under
miranda,
and
therefore--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--he
had
a
right
to
be
in
the
hallway,
that's
true.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
think,
your
honor,
that
when
the
doorway
was
blown
open,
it
has
not
now
come
open
by
an
event
which
one
of
the
defendants
was
in
control
of.
none
of
the
parties
was
in
control
of.
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
chief
justice's
question
i
think
where
the
police
officer
is
bringing
mr.
overdahl
down
the
hall
and
the
police
officer
sees
some
marihuana
in
another
room.
and
in
that
case,
i
would
say
he
could
go
in.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
no,
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
infer
that
he
didn't
have
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
can
prove
its
case
by
evidence
that
would
arise
from
the
individual.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
but
it
is
an
individual
who
is
in
the
same
position,
as
i
indicated
earlier...
at
least
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
when
the
individual
has...
when
a
co
tenant
has
given
up
the
privacy
of
the
premises
because
of
a
violation
of
that
co
tenant's
rights,
the
non
consenting
co
tenant
should,
i
submit,
stand
in
the
same
shoes,
because
it
is
the
protection
of
the
privacy
of
the
premises
that
i
believe
is
at
stake.
and
this
court
has
on
several
occasions
indicated
that
it
will
certainly
assert
and
recognize
the
rights
of
the
people
who
are...
who
have
possessory
interest
in
the
property,
although
that
is
not
necessarily
the
key.
but
again
i
believe
that
bumper
handles
the
standing
question
in
which
the
mother,
i
believe
it
was,
who
owned
the
premises
gave...
acceded
to
the
request
of
the
police
officers
to
come
in
under
the
proposition
that
they
had
a
search
warrant.
and
it
was
the
defendant
then
who
was
given
standing
to
assert
that
the
entry
was
invalid
because
it
was
under
the
mistaken
hypothesis
that
the
police
officer
did
have
a
search
warrant.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--the
washington
supreme
court
said
no.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
ah--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--that's
why
i
said
i
didn't
think
so
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
can
understand
why
a
police
officer
would
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
he
could
protect
himself
from
an
attack
or
an
assault.
the
problem
is,
in
this
case,
a
police
officer's
actions
did
not
give
any
indication
that
he
had
any
concern
about
that.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
he
stood
in
the
doorway,
he
had
not
frisked
the
individual
before
he
got
there,
at
least
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that
he
did.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
if
he
had
gone
into
the
room?
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
under
our
supreme
court's
decision,
which
we
submit
could
be
supported
under
the
washington
constitution,
and
under
state
vs.
seiss,
a
new
jersey
decision
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
theory
is
that
there
are
some
types
of
arrests
which
are
so
insignificant
that
it
is
not
valid
for
the
police
officer
to
accompany
the
individual
into
the
room.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
the
washington
supreme
court
cited
state
vs.
daugherty,
which
is
a
washington
case.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
think
that
they
could
have
and
i'm
not
100
%
sure.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i'm
not
really
sure,
frankly,
whether
they
did
or
did
not.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes,
i'm
suggesting
that
this
court...
if
this
court
believes
that
the
search
could
be
upheld
under
federal
constitutional
grounds,
i
believe
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
back
to
the
state
supreme
court
to
see
if
the
state
supreme
court
decided
the
case
under
the
state
constitution.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
concept
that
the
states
can
interpret
their
own
constitution
and
can
grant
additional
rights
over
and
above
those
granted
to
the
federal
constitution
frankly
is
of
relatively
recent
origin,
and
i
don't
think
it's
been
thoroughly
thought
out,
frankly.
i
believe
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
law
review
article
he
propounded
that
proposition.
and
i
think
that
frankly,
part
of
the
reason
would
be,
although
it's
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
to
say
for
themselves,
but
i
would
think
that
part
of
the
reason
is
that
the
state
supreme
courts
have
grown
so
accustomed
to
examining
questions
in
light
of
what
they
think
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
going
to
rule,
that
they
are
very
used
to
taking
precedent
from
the
u.s.
supreme
court.
and
i
believe,
however,
that
in
the
future,
as
this
theory
is...
we
all
have
more
experience
with
this
theory,
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
see
state
supreme
court
decisions
resting
their
decision
on
their
state
constitutional
grounds
where
it
is
their
view
that
additional
rights
are
granted
under
their
respective
constitutions.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
one
of
the
authorities
cited
by
the
state
supreme
court
was,
as
i
say,
the
state
vs.
daugherty.
now,
state
vs.
daugherty
itself
cited
some
federal
cases
and
some
state
cases,
and
i
did
review
some
of
those
state
cases
and
again,
those
cases
cited
are
also
state
and
federal
cases.
i
believe
that
the
state
supreme
court
could
have
decided
this
case
under
the
state
constitution,
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
if
this
court
feels
that
the
state
constitution...
or
rather,
that
the
federal
constitution
was
not
violated
by
the
search,
then
i
would
request
the
court,
again,
to
remand
it
back
to
the
state
supreme
court
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
search
could
be
sustained
under
the
state
constitution.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
your
honor,
i
think
that
may
well
be,
but
i
think
that
where
the
supreme
court,
or
where
the
case...
if
the
case
were
to
be
reversed
and
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
i
would
think
that
if
the
trial
court
then
were
to
sentence
the
individual
and
impose
a
sentence,
that
again,
we
would
probably
be
faced
with
trying
to
go
back
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
give
the
state
supreme
court
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of...
under
the
state
constitution.
and
i
believe
it
would
avoid
a
lot
of
circular
action
if
it
were
simply
to
go
back
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
but
i
think
in
the...
i
believe
certainly
in
recent
history
under
the
state
court...
under
the
constitutional
principles,
the
state
supreme
courts
have...
particularly
after
mann...
have
become
accustomed
to
following
the
precedent
of
the
u.s.
supreme
court,
and
feel...
i
believe
for
a
time
felt
pretty
much
locked
in
by
the
precedents
set
by
this
court.
and
the
state
supreme
court
then
should
be
allowed,
i
submit,
to
decide
this
case
on
state
constitutional
principles,
if
the
court
determines
that
this
case
should
not
be
decided
as
incorrect
under
federal
constitutional
principles.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
that's
my...
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
this
type...
an
arrest
for
this
type
of
offense
did
not
justify
the
police
officer
accompanying
the
individual
into
the
room.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
no,
that's
my
understanding
of
the
chrisman
case.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
yes.
the
simpson
case,
which
we
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
court
can
interpret
its
own
constitution
and
indeed
has
interpreted
in
some
instances
the
state
constitution
to
give
the
additional
rights
than
those
given
under
the
federal
constitution,
we
submit
was
not
simply
standing,
because
standing
is
not
a
constitutional
interpretation,
as
i
see
it.
so
i
believe
the
state
constitution
could
vindicate
the
holding
of
the
state
court.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
i
believe
that
when...
yes,
your
honor,
when
the
police
officer
found
out
that
he
was
under
the
age
of
19,
i
believe
that
at
that
point--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--yes.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
no,
your
honor,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
the
police
officer
had
given
mr.
overdahl
his
miranda
rights,
and
therefore,
did
not
have
the
right
to
accompany
him
to
get
evidence
against
mr.
overdahl.
and
that
if
anything--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
believe
the
case
authority
is
that
the
police
officers,
on
certain
occasions
where
there...
and
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
state
indicate
that
the
request
was
for
a
purpose
of
the
accused
rather
than
a
purpose
of
the
police
officer,
where
that
is
permitted.
i
believe
that...
i
haven't
touched
yet
on
the
knock
and
announce
rule,
and
i
would
like
to
just
touch
very
briefly
on
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
if
the
police
officer
were
outside
the
room
and
had
accompanied
mr.
overdahl
to
the
room
and
were
at
that
point
outside
the
room,
now
the
nature
of
the
situation
when
he
determines
to
enter
the
room,
it
seems
to
me,
has
been
changed.
he
has
now...
he
was
at
the
room
for
one
purpose
and
is
outside
that
room
and
has
now
decided
for
whatever
reason
to
go
into
the
room,
and
i
submit
at
that
point,
under
the
knock
and
announce
rule,
he
should...
while
he
might
not
have
had
to
knock;
i
don't
think
he
would
have
had
to
knock,
but
i
do
believe
that
he
should
have
announced
his
purpose
to
enter
the
room.
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
it
was
my
understanding
that
it
was
of
constitutional
proportion,
or
at
least
it's
my
understanding
that
the
state--
mr.
robert
f.
patrick
--i
believe
that
our
state
supreme
court
has
determined
that
it
is
of
constitutional
proportions.
in
summation,
if
i
could
simply
say
to
the
court
that
in
this
case,
if
the
police
officer
were
outside
the
room,
and
if
the
court
finds
exigent
circumstances,
he
created
his
own
exigent
circumstances.
he
could
have
maintained
the
status
quo
and
did
not.
he
could
have
maintained
with
his
radio
a
guard
at
the
door
while
a
search
warrant
was
obtained,
and
we
submit
that
where
we
are
talking
about
protection
to
the
dwelling,
the
protection
in
maintaining
the
right
to
privacy,
that
where
a
reasonable
opportunity
exists
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
and
preserve
the
status
quo,
that
this
court
will
require
that
the
status
quo
be
maintained
and
that
a
search
warrant
be
obtained
and
that
the
entry
be
made
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant.
thank
you,
your
honors.
