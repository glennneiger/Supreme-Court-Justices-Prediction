mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
alaska
supreme
court.
that
decision
declared
constitutional
a
statute
which
distributes
income
from
alaska's
permanent
fund
based
solely
on
the
duration
of
the
residency
of
the
recipient.
the
fund
itself
was
set
up
in
1976
as
a
respository
for
surplus
revenues.
in
1980,
some
four
years
after
the
fund
was
created,
this
statute
was
passed,
and
it
proposes
to
allocate
one
half
of
the
income
of
the
fund.
it
is
this
statute
and
not
the
existence
of
the
fund
itself
which
the
appellants
challenge.
the
case
is
unlike
every
other
durational
residency
case
which
has
come
before
this
court.
in
those
cases
the
durational
residency
requirement
was
being
used
as
a
test;
it
was
being
used
as
a
test
of
domicile.
here
the
appellants
are
unquestioned
alaskans.
here
it's
not
being
used
as
a
test.
here
it's
simply
being
used
to
assign
legal
status
to
persons
who
are
unquestionably
alaskans.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
there's
a
series
of
regulations
that
have
been
promulgated,
and
i
forget
precisely
what
they
say,
but
there's
a
formula
which
would,
i
believe...
and
mr.
gross
will
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong...
but
i
believe
that
he
would
basically
pick
up
where
he
left
off,
but
he
certainly
would
not
get
credit
for
the
time
he
was
away.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that
is
true.
in
other
words,
this
case,
although
i
have
personal
doubts
about
the
wisdom
or
validity
of
giving
money
away
to
begin
with,
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about.
and
we
haven't
argued
that,
and
we've
not
attempted
to
present
that
issue.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
a
family
of
five
would,
as
long
as
they
were
all
adults...
children
are
not
included
in
the
plan...
but
as
long
as
they
were
all
adults,
a
family
of
five
would
accrue
five
separate
shares.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
no
one
under
18
participates
in
the
plan.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
no.
he
would
have
20,
but
he
would
not
receive...
well,
if
someone
were
17
this
year,
for
example,
he
would
receive
nothing.
if
he
became
18
next
year,
he
would
receive
18
units,
but
he
would
not
receive
the
17
that
he
would
have
received
this
year.
in
other
words,
it's
not
put
in
a
trust
fund
anywhere
for
him;
they
simply
don't
receive
it.
if
the
right
of
interstate
migration
and
the
right
to
acquire
citizenship
in
the
state
in
which
one
resides
mean
anything,
they
must
mean
that
a
state
is
not
free
to
hand
a
new
migrant
a
number
at
the
border
and
say
here,
this
number
is
going
to
determine
your
legal
status
in
our
local
tax
system
for
as
long
as
you
remain
here.
durational
residency
requirements
are
sometimes
permissible
as
a
test
of
the
bona
fides
of
a
claim
of
state
citizenship,
but
the
constitutional
minimum
has
to
be
that
at
some
point
the
test
is
over.
at
some
point
the
new
resident
has
to
acquire
full,
equal
and
undifferentiated
citizenship
the
same
as
all
other
citizens
of
the
state
possess.
that
very
point
was
recognized
by
this
court
110
years
ago
in
the
slaughterhouse
cases
when
the
court
observed
that
the
14th
amendment
itself
created
a
substantive
federally
guaranteed
right
to
become
a
citizen
of
any
state
through
bona
fide
residence
with
the
same
rights
as
other
citizens
of
that
state.
the
constitution
doesn't
allow
a
state
to
have
classes
of
citizens.
ranking
the
citizenry
based
upon
when
they
acquired
their
citizenship
we
believe
is
a
direct
infringement
on
the
right
of
interstate
migration.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
this
court
has
obviously
dealt
with
that
question
on
a
number
of
occasions,
and
it
has...
as
i
recall,
what
it
said
was
that
the
14th
amendment
expressly
allows
that.
here
there's
no
analogous
provision,
we
believe.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
correct.
we
certainly
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
permissible
classification
of
citizens,
though.
it
is
true
that
felons
do
indeed
enjoy
less
civil
rights
than
other
people.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
i
think
that's
right.
we're
not
questioning
the
state's
ability
to
impose
a
waiting
period
as
one
element
of
proving
domicile.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
that
in
itself
is
a
constitutional
question,
and
that's
the
question
that
we
believe
shapiro
and
maricopa
county
and
sosna
were
about.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
and
in
fact,
the
cases
certainly
seem
to
suggest
that
perhaps
up
to
a
year
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
individual
interest
and
the
state
interest
being
asserted.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
it
was
a
year,
which
was
struck
down
there.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
yes.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
for
the
welfare
interest,
that's
right,
because
that
was
a
significant
individual
interest.
in
other
cases
the
court,
for
example,
has
suggested
that
a
year
might
be
appropriate
for
higher
education.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
the
first
sentence.
the
first
sentence
of
the
14th
amendment
creates
the
right
to
be
a
state
citizen.
it's
a
federally
secured
right.
that
sentence
was
intended
to
overrule
dread
scott
and
make
people
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
resided,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that
certainly
is
our
view
of
the
situation,
and
that's
the
way
the
law's
developed.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
and
the
citizenship
which
the
14th
amendment
granted
in
our
opinion
is
the
same
citizenship
that
was
enjoyed
by
persons
who
were
able
to
claim
citizenship
without
reference
to
the
14th
amendment
before
its
passage.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
that's--
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
--of
course
i
think
that's
wrong.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
we
have
not
specifically
advocated
that
as
a
basis,
and
i
guess
i
honestly
would
have
to
concede
that
i
don't
know.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
yes,
we
do.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
we
say
that
this
is
a
substantive
violation
of
the
right
to
acquire
citizenship,
and
we
also
say
it
is
a
fundamental
right
strand
of
equal
protection
case.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
we
think
the
constitution
can't
be
different
from
state
to
state,
and
we
think
that
while
the
state
puts
this
forth
as
a
revolutionary
new
idea
in
government,
we
think
it's
a
very
old
idea
in
government.
we
think
the
idea
than
some
people
have
superior
legal
rights
over
others
is
as
old
as
kings
and
pharoahs.
we
think
it's
a
converse
idea,
that
all
citizens
are
equal,
which
is
truly
revolutionary.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
we
began
this
lawsuit
by
filing
against
two
statutes,
and
the
first
of
them
was
almost
analogous
to
the
hypothetical
which
you
suggested,
and
that
was
struck
down
on
state
equal
protection
grounds.
and
so
yes,
i
certainly
think
that
would
be
analogous
to
this.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
i
suppose
that's
right.
what
it
really
is
in
our
view
is
a
way
of
rewarding
long
term
residents
simply
for
being
long
term
residents,
and
we
believe
that
that's
constitutionally
impermissible.
and
while
the
state
does
assert
that
it
serves
various
other
purposes,
in
our
view...
certainly
i
would
never
say
that
i
don't
believe
that,
but
what
i
would
say
is
that
it's
remarkable
that
it
serves
those
only
indirectly,
but
it's
perfectly
fitted
to
an
impermissible
purpose,
and
that's
recognizing
past
contributions
of
the
citizenry.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
i'm
sorry.
the
one
year
resident,
if
you
imposed
the
one
year
waiting
requirement?
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
it's
true
that
he
has
a
driver's
license
and
he
votes,
but
he
certainly
has
less
legal
rights,
and
he
has
less
legal
rights
purely--
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
--he
has
less
legal
rights
purely
because
of
when
he
acquired
his
citizenship.
and
thus
we
think
you
have
to
do
more
than
call
someone
a
citizen;
we
think
you
have
to
treat
them
like
one.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
one
citizen
may
certainly
be
treated
differently
from
another
when
judged
by
neutral
criteria
and
unrelated
to
the
quality
of
their
citizenship.
for
example,
i'm
not
standing
here
telling
the
court
that
if
one
person
gets
welfare,
everybody's
got
to
get
welfare;
neither
certainly
a
neutral
criterion
unrelated
to
the
quality
of
one's
citizenship.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
once
a
person
is
citizen,
once
they've
satisfied
a
waiting
requirement
and
the
test
is
over,
then
they
cannot
be
ranked
on
the
basis
of
the
quality
of
their
citizenship
or
when
they
acquired
it.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
obviously
not.
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
the
idea
that
a
state
is
free
to
distinguish
between
new
and
old
residents
in
its
consistent
rejection
of
the
contribution
rationale.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
they
would
certainly
have
standing
to
file
that
claim.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
it
would
be
no
different,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
at
least
theoretically
the
class
is
everyone
other
than
the
people
who
were
there
in
1959,
but
as
a
practical
matter
it's
perhaps
like
a
reapportionment
case
that
a
person
at
some
level
achieves
enough
so
that
he
doesn't
want
to
rock
the
boat.
you
may
not
live
in
the
most
overrepresented
district,
but
you
don't
want
to
file
the
lawsuit
either.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right,
because
a
durational
residency
requirement
here
is
a
lifetime.
as
long
as
someone's
alive
in
the
state
of
alaska
who
got
there
before
my
clients
did,
they
will
never
achieve
the
maximum
benefit
under
this
plan.
so
the
waiting
period
here
is
forever.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
entirely
possible.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
it
certainly
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
program
if
that
were
true.
it's
entirely
possible
that
it
could
be.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
of
course.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
personally,
i
would
have
decided
chimento
differently.
that's
quite
right.
i
recognize
there
are
a
variety
of
possibilities
to
explain
chimento,
though.
one
is
that
the
lower
court
did
indeed
find
a
compelling
interest
for
doing
that,
and
it
is
possible
that
this
court
accepted
that.
that
was
simply
a
summary
affirmance,
so
all
we
know
is
that
the
court
accepted
the
results.
or
it
could
be
that
in
the
political
area
itself,
as
with
aliens,
the
rules
become
somewhat
different.
i
don't
know.
in
my
view
i
would
have
decided
chimento
differently.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
i
think
that
once
the
state
goes
beyond
imposing
a
waiting
period...
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
address
the
waiting
period.
when
you
have
a
waiting
period,
i
think
it
may
be
appropriate
to
have
a
penalty
type
analysis
or
weighing
of
competing
interests
to
see
how
long
the
waiting
period
could
be;
but
once
you
go
beyond
the
waiting
period
and
start
classifying
people
who
are
unquestionably
citizens
based
solely
on
when
they
acquired
their
citizenship,
then
i
think
you
ought
to
demonstrate
a
compelling
interest
for
doing
that.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
oh,
i
think
that's
valid,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
case
as
long
as
they
gave
it
to
everyone
in
the
state
who
was
over
70
without
regard
to
when
they
got
there.
then
that's
simply
a
regular,
straightforward
equal
protection
case
concerning
age
discrimination;
and
in
my
view
that
particular
exemption
would
be
valid.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
it's
quite
true,
and
the
state
does
argue
that
everyone
participates
in
the
plan;
therefore,
it
must
be
all
right.
i've
heard
them
make
that
argument,
but
to
my
way
of
thinking
that's
sort
of
like
saying
plessey
vs.
ferguson
there
was
no
problem
because
everybody
rode
the
train.
the
real
question
is
not
does
everyone
participate
in
the
program.
it's
how
do
we
divide
up
the
participants.
and
the
way
they're
being
divided
up
here
is
a
way
which
we
suggest
is
offensive.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
that's
right.
the
state
advances
two
purposes
in
its
brief
here:
stabilizing
the
population
and
conserving
the
fund.
we
believe
that
neither
of
those
may
fairly
be
deemed
compelling,
but
interestingly
enough,
neither
of
them
are
even
rationally
related
to
the
retrospective
features
of
this
plan.
in
other
words,
awarding
for
past
residents,
residents
since
1959--
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
yes.
i
think
the
state
should
have
to
demonstrate
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
this
sort
of
a
classification.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
well,
certainly
one
that's
more
significant
than
stabilizing
the
population.
i
think
it's--
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
--it's
where
the
state
is
really
left
with
no
choice,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
but
the
only
purpose
which
plausibly
explains
the
1959
date
and
the
retrospective
features
of
this
plan
is
giving
more
money
to
people
who
live
there.
it's
a
perfect
fit
with
that
one.
it's
a
very
rational
relationship.
and
that's
the
purpose
which
this
court
has
long
said
was
impermissible.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
no.
i
think
if
the
plan
began
in
1980
and
ran
forward
and
the
appropriate
level
of
review
was
minimum
rationality,
which
i
certainly
don't
think
it
is;
but
if
that
was
the
appropriate
level
of
review,
then
i
probably
wouldn't
be
here.
but
in
this
country
it's
never
mattered
that
your
family
came
over
on
the
mayflower.
that
may
confer
social
status,
but
until
now
that
sort
of
distinction
has
never
conferred
legal
status.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
but
they
don't
legislate
it.
if
i
may,
i'd
stand
down.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
unless
there
are
questions
i
would
waive
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
i
think
at
last
count
there
are
somewhere
around
750.
mr.
mark
a.
sandberg
several
hundred
thousand
of
the
state...
i
mean
of
the
city.
the
state
is
about
400,000.
