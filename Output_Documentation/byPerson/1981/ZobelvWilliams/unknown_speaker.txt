unknown
speaker
mr.
sandberg,
a
couple
of
questions
to
straighten
me
out.
do
you
know
of
any
other
case
where
a
state
has
been
paying
out,
in
effect
issuing
a
dividend
to
residents?
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
a
ten
year
resident
leaves
for
five
years
and
then
come
backs.
would
he
have
to
start
all
over
again
under
your
system?
unknown
speaker
if
alaska
paid
an
equal
dividend...
i
call
it
that;
it's
in
quotation
marks...
to
every
resident,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
unknown
speaker
and
may
an
alaska
resident
qualify
even
though
he's
never
paid
a
dime
in
taxes?
unknown
speaker
and
if
a
young
man
were
18
now
would
he
qualify
even
though
he
never
voted?
unknown
speaker
so
that
a
family
of
five
would
get
five
shares
based
on
their
respective
units.
unknown
speaker
children
are
not
included
then.
unknown
speaker
what
if
one
became
18
two
years
ago,
would
he
have
two
units?
unknown
speaker
what
about
classes
of
citizens
who
are
denied
their
right
to
vote
because
of
felony
convictions?
unknown
speaker
so
your
statement
isn't
categorically
true.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
period
of
time
were,
let's
say,
a
year
before
one
could
get
the
full
amount,
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
time
and
therefore
a
valid
provision?
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
how
long?
unknown
speaker
thirty
days,
sixty
days,
something
like
that
might
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
time
in
shapiro
against
new
york?
unknown
speaker
one
year.
unknown
speaker
so
one
year
was
too
much.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandberg,
i
think
i
heard
you
say
that
you
thought
this
whole
case
was
settled
by
a
sentence
in
the
14th
amendment.
which
sentence?
unknown
speaker
it
went
a
little
further.
dred
scott
was
only
about
negroes,
but
the
14th
amendment
brought
everybody
in.
unknown
speaker
everybody
got
citizenship
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
your
slaughterhouse
cases
also
said
this
only
applied
to
the
newly
freed
slaves.
unknown
speaker
which
you
think
was
wrong.
you
have
to.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
second
sentence
of
the
amendment:
"nor
shall
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property.
"
does
that
give
you
any
help
or
support?
unknown
speaker
do
you
make
an
equal
protection
argument?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
rely
on
that
last
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
it
be
argued
that
this
is
a
classical
case
for
the
application
of
justice
brandeis'
doctrine
in
newstate
ice
versus
liebman;
that
we
have
now
50
experimental
laboratories,
and
alaska
has
now
a
very
peculiar
situation
which
has
existed
since
the
time
of
the
klondike
days
where
there
have
been
tremendous
resources
that
have
just
been
squandered
away,
and
they
are
now
making
an
effort
to
preserve
them,
and
they
should
be
given
some
latitude
in
experimentation?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
is
comparable
to
a
statute
which
would
provide
that
the
people
in
this
preferred
class
would
pay
taxes
according
to
the
length
of
time
they
lived
in
the
state;
in
other
words,
the
old
residents
would
pay
half
as
much
as
the
newcomers?
unknown
speaker
this
is
sort
of
an
anticipatory
refund,
isn't
it,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandberg,
i
don't
understand
why
the
first
sentence
of
the
14th
amendment
answers
the
question.
i
gather
the
one
year
resident
of
the
state
is
just
as
much
a
citizen
of
the
state
by
force
of
that
first
sentence
as
is
the
ten
year
resident
of
the
state,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
under
the
statute
i
gather
a
one
year
resident
gets
less
of
a
bonus
or
whatever
this
proper
label
is
than
does
the
ten
year
resident,
but
the
one
year
resident
is
just
as
much
a
citizen
of
alaska
as
is
the
ten
year
resident,
is
he
not?
unknown
speaker
no.
he
simply
doesn't
get
as
much
of
this
largesse
as
does
the
ten
year
resident,
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
theory
of
your
case
is
the
combination
of
the
first
sentence
and
the
last,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
once
he's
a
citizen
he
may
not
or
she
may
not
be
treated
in
any
way
different
from
any
other
citizen,
whether
it's
on
the
tax
rate
imposed
or
receiving
this
bonus,
as
justice
brennan
called
it.
unknown
speaker
in
the
voting
area
you
wouldn't
go
for
giving
a
15
votes
and
a
one
year
resident
one
vote.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandberg,
i
think
your
clients
came
into
your
state
in
1978.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
arguments
if
your
clients
had
come
into
the
state
in
1975
or
1972?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
difference
between
your
position
if
you
were
representing
the
earlier
arrivals
and
the
position
you
take
here
today?
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
would
be
true
if
you
went
back
to
someone
who
had
been
there,
what,
18
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
emphasizes
the
first
statement
you
made
that
this
is
entirely
different
from
any
durational
residency
case
we've
had.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
more
penalty
imposed
on
your
client
in
terms
of
theory
than
imposed
on
any
resident
who
came
in
subsequent
to
the
first
year.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
as
long
as
someone
is
alive
who
arrived
before
your
clients
did,
they
will
be
paying
more
taxes
to
alaska
than
your
clients
will,
will
they
not?
unknown
speaker
it's
possible
but
not
necessarily
true.
not
because
of
any
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
also
possible
that
these
people
who
have
been
there
20
years
may
have
never
paid
a
dime
in
taxes,
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
may
have
some
indians
or
eskimos
who
haven't
contributed
mightily
to
the
economy.
mr.
sandberg,
would
you
find
that
the
state
requirements
that
impose,
for
example,
a
seven
year
residence
requirement
before
the
person
can
be
a
candidate
for
a
certain
public
office
to
be
invalid
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
this
court
has
not
always
applied
the
same
test,
has
it,
in
determining
the
validity
of
durational
residence
requirements;
in
other
words,
a
strict
scrutiny
versus
some
other
level
of
examination?
unknown
speaker
and
where
do
you
think
this
case
ought
to
fit
in
the
level
of
scrutiny?
unknown
speaker
what
about
age,
mr.
sandberg?
suppose
a
state
in
its
income
tax
setup
gave
someone
over
70
a
special
exemption.
is
that
valid
or
invalid?
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
giving
this
to
every
resident
of
the
state.
it
just
differs
as
to
amount.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
you
rest
on
your
equal
protection
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandberg,
you
used
the
word
"compelling".
does
this
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
to
you
earlier?
the
level
of
scrutiny
should
be
compelling
state
interest?
unknown
speaker
to
justify
this.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
definition
of
a
compelling
state
interest?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
one
that
compels
a
result,
isn't
it?
aren't
we--
unknown
speaker
--sure.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandburg,
following
up
on
your
suggestion
that
there
might
be
a
distinction
between
prospective
and
retrospective
application,
would
you
say
that
it
was
irrational
if
the
program
were
purely
prospective
and
said
after
the
date
of
enactment,
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
reside
in
the
state,
we
will
have
this
bonus
for
long
time
residents?
unknown
speaker
sometimes
in
boston
it's
pretty
important.
unknown
speaker
is
it
on
state
land
or
federal
land?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
temporary?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
temporary?
unknown
speaker
but
temporary
is
a
long
way
off,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
can
the
state
borrow
from
that
fund
itself?
unknown
speaker
can
the
fund
be
invested?
unknown
speaker
can
it
be
invested
in
state
bonds,
which
would
be
another
way
of
putting
the
same
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
assume
you're
going
to
relate
that
program
to
this
issue.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gross.
unknown
speaker
can
i
shorten
this
a
little
by
saying--
unknown
speaker
--that
i
for
one
think
that
the
14th
amendment
applied
to
states
with
all
the
money
as
well
as
states
with
no
money.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you're
all
saying
that
you're
in
a
special
position
because
you've
got
a
lot
of
money.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
suggest
it.
i
insist.
unknown
speaker
that's
true
under
your
plan,
too.
unknown
speaker
as
more
people
come
in,
there's
less
money
to
divide.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
true.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
plan
is
to
discourage
people
from
coming
to
alaska?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
you're
arguing.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
true
of
all
sorts
of
things
the
government
do,
that
the
more
you
tend
to
encourage
people
to
come
to
your
state,
the
more
populated
it
gets,
you
generate
all
sorts
of
problems.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
argument
you're
making
is
one
that
says
we
just
would
like
to
keep
the
state
about
the
same
density
of
population
as
we
now
have.
unknown
speaker
it
depends
somewhat
on
whether
there's
a
productivity
factor
involved
there.
unknown
speaker
because
if
half
of
them
were
on
relief,
it
wouldn't
help
your
tax
base
much,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
suppose
you
wanted
to
encourage...
or
have
you
finished
your
answer
to--
unknown
speaker
--no.
but
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
the
way
in
which
you
manage
the
money...
that
is,
either
saving
it
for
the
long
term
or
distributing
it
right
away...
will
be
influenced
by
this
program.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
throw
one
other
thing
on
the
table,
because
i
don't
want
to
be
interrupting
you
too
often
on
this.
your
opponent
argues
that
well,
maybe
there's
rationality
applying
to
the
future,
but
how
does
any
of
this
justify
the
fact
that
at
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
statute
those
who
had
been
there
the
longest
got
more.
just
be
sure
you
cover
that
before
you
finish.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
do
make
the
beginning
date
1959
instead
of
the
date
of
enactment.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
state
purpose
at
the
date
of
enactment
for
saying
that
a
person
who
has
been
here
since
1959
should
get
something
more
than
someone
who
arrived
two
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
then
are
you
saying
that
the
constitutionality
of
your
plan
would
be
just
the
same
as
if
you
had
a
one
time
distribution
in
which
you
gave
a
big
chunk
of
money
based
on
length
of
residence?
unknown
speaker
well,
insofar
as
you
were
talking
about
the
retroactive
feature
of
it,
it
is
a
one
time
plan.
unknown
speaker
but
i
still
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
same
basis,
"same"
in
quotes.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
every
other
sentence.
you
say
"same"
basis.
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
the
whole
argument
in
this
case
was
that
there
wasn't
a
same
basis.
unknown
speaker
there
were
two
different
bases.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
does
everybody
get
the
same
amount
of
money?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
talking
about
cash
in
hand.
unknown
speaker
does
everybody
get
the
same?
unknown
speaker
well,
once
again,
look
at
it
with
cash.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
this
case
is
about...
cash.
you
started
off
by
saying
you
were
loaded
with
cash.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gross.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
shapiro
case
and
the
welfare
and
the
hospital
case
that
the
court
had
to
decide
would
have
been
decided
differently
if
the
beneficiaries
got
a
little
bit
of
welfare
the
first
year
and
more
the
second?
unknown
speaker
or
a
little
bit
of
medical
care
the
first
year
and
more
the
second?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
you're
arguing?
unknown
speaker
the
benefit
level
differs,
does
it
not,
depending--
unknown
speaker
--the
benefit
level
differs
depending
on
the
length
of
one's
residency.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
that
the
court
would
have
sustained
that
kind
of
a
difference
in
shapiro
or
in
memorial
hospital?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
do
you
recognize
or
concede
that
there
is
a
fundamental
right
to
migrate
or
travel?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
that
alaska's
plan
in
any
way
inhibits
someone's
desire
to
move
or
to
travel?
unknown
speaker
from
alaska.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
there
would
be
a
motivation
to
stay
there
and
earn
the
thousand
dollars
instead
of
move
to
california?
unknown
speaker
and
lose
it?
unknown
speaker
the
purpose...
is
one
of
the
purposes
to
discourage
people
from
migrating
from
alaska?
unknown
speaker
and
does
that
fly
in
the
face
of
any
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
or
an
old
age
pension?
unknown
speaker
suppose
alaska
wanted
to
encourage
people
to
come
there
and
passed
a
statute
that
for
the
first
five
years
of
your
residence
a
new
resident
after
a
given
date,
they
would
be
free
from
state
income
taxes
or
all
of
the
state
taxes?
do
you
think
that
would
pass
muster?
unknown
speaker
corporations
are
persons
under
the
14th
amendment.
unknown
speaker
has
this
court
ever
passed
on
the
corporate...
the
constitutionality
of
these
corporate
benefits?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gross?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
state
validly
could
impose
an
income
tax
graduated
according
to
the
residence
of
the
people
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
is
it
could
not
do
so
validly?
unknown
speaker
if
down
the
road
five
years
from
now
alaska
found
it
necessary
to
impose
an
income
tax,
would
not
these
graduated
benefits
result
in
effect
in
a
graduated
income
tax
based
on
residency?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
you
owed
under
the
state
income
tax
a
thousand
dollars
and
received
dividends
for
a
thousand
dollars,
the
net
effect
of
what
you
paid
the
tax
would
be
zero.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
that
would
be
valid.
unknown
speaker
you
think
there's
no
relationship
between
the
two.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
distribute
old
age
benefits
in
accordance
with
residency
duration,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gross,
you
keep
referring
to
a
rational
basis
test.
what
if
the
court
has
to
apply
a
stricter
scrutiny
to
a
durational
residence
scheme
such
as
alaska's?
unknown
speaker
but
the
level
of
benefits
is
different
depending
upon
residence.
unknown
speaker
there
are
18
levels
or
20
levels.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that,
for
instance,
voters
in
a
state
could
adopt
by
vote
a
welfare
scheme
that
would
determine
the
level
of
benefits
based
on
the
number
of
years
that
the
person
had
lived
in
the
state
and
have
a
graduated
scale?
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
had
a
state
statute
that
wasn't
adopted
by
the
majority?
unknown
speaker
that
weren't
adopted
by
the
majority
of
the
voters.
why
do
you
keep
emphasizing
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
equal
protection
clause
is
limited
to
majority
and
minority?
unknown
speaker
did
you
read
maricopa
county?
unknown
speaker
well,
race
wasn't
in
maricopa,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
was
race
involved
in
maricopa?
unknown
speaker
race
was
not
involved.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
this
involve
newcomers?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
this
statute
involve--
unknown
speaker
--recent
newcomers.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
