mr.
avrum
m.
gross
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
end
this
plan
is
going
to
stand
or
fall
on
whether
i
can
convey
to
you
the
rationality
of
the
dividend
distribution
system
that's
used
in
the
plan;
and
that
dividend
distribution
system
is
just
a
part
of
an
overall
plan
that
the
state
of
alaska
is
using
to
deal
with
a
very
unusual
and
unique
problem.
we
have
a
great
deal
of
temporary
oil
wealth
in
the
state
of
alaska.
the
state
has
been
poverty
stricken
for
literally
hundreds
of
year,
and
we
now
have,
because
of
the
fortuity
of
oil
being
discovered
on
state
land,
temporary
influx
of
a
great
deal
of
money.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
it's
on
state
land,
primarily
the
land
in
prudhoe
bay.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i'm
sorry.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
because
it's
a
finite
resource,
justice
brennan.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
temporary
is
very
quick.
we're
talking
20
to
30
years.
that's
a
popular,
i
think,
misconception,
but
the
field
depletes
at
something
like
the
rate
of
one
percent
every
60
days.
and
there
have
been
no
other
major
oil
finds
in
the
state
of
alaska,
so
we
are
dealing
with
a
resource
which
for
a
short
period
of
time
will
produce
several
billions
of
dollars
for
the
state...
it's
like
the
gold
at
the
turn
of
the
century...
but
then
will
be
gone,
forever.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
system
which
will
avoid
repeating
alaska's
past,
which
is
great
periods
of
wealth
and
then
total
deprivation
thereafter.
now,
to
do
that...
i
should
say
that
our
early
start
at
this
problem
was
not
very
successful.
the
state
had
its
first
and
most
major
oil
lease
sale
in
1969.
it
collected
from
that
sale
$900
million
in
a
state
that
had
a
budget
at
the
time
of
roughly
$150
million
per
annum.
and
within
six
years
the
money
was
all
gone,
and
government
programs
which
had
been
established
by
legislators
who
were
interested
in
both
the
pressing
needs
of
the
state
and
their
own
political
futures
were
running
out
of
funds.
the
state
was
on
the
edge
of
bankruptcy.
what
happened
then
was,
of
course,
that
finally
the
oil
money
started
to
come
in
again,
primarily
through
the
construction
of
the
pipeline;
and
now
we
are
faced
with
the
same
problem:
a
temporary
influx
of
oil
dollars,
and
the
problem
is
how
to
make
them
last.
now,
to
do
that
we
have
embarked
on
a
rather
unique
plan
in
alaska.
it's
never
been
tried
before.
the
governor
proposed,
and
the
legislature
eventually
adopted,
and
the
people
overwhelmingly
passed
a
constitutional
amendment
establishing
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
permanent
fund.
the
constitutional
amendment
provided
that
at
least
25
percent
of
the
bonuses
and
royalties
from
oil
would
be
placed
in
this
fund.
the
fund
itself
may
not
be
appropriated
for
any
purpose
by
the
legislature.
the
only
thing
that
may
be
used
is
the
interest
from
the
fund.
now,
of
course,
that
does
two
things.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
don't
believe
the
state
may
borrow
from
the
fund.
the
fund
can
certainly
be
invested
in
certain
programs.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
to
my
knowledge,
no,
justice
burger.
the
creation
of
the
fund
does
two
things.
first
of
all,
of
course
it
saves
a
portion
of
the
money
for
the
future,
25
percent
at
a
minimum.
but
more
important,
it
transforms
a
finite
resource
into
an
infinite
source
of
revenue.
by
restricting
the
legislature
to
the
use
only
of
the
interest
on
the
fund,
that
interest
can
continue
in
perpetuity,
at
least
in
theory;
so
that
government
programs
constructed
on
it,
social
programs
and
the
like,
can
continue
long
after
the
oil
is
gone.
public
expectations
will
be
based
not
on
the
principle
of
the
fund
because
that
is
not
appropriated.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
i
am.
now,
when
you
set
that
up,
it
creates
an
immediate
public
and
a
political
conflict.
on
the
one
hand
you
have
the
legislature
which
is
faced
with
rather
pressing
public
needs,
to
say
nothing
of
their
own
political
futures,
faced
with
large
infusions
of
oil
wealth.
they
have
use
of
75
percent
of
all
the
oil
wealth
that
comes
in,
plus
the
interest
from
the
25
percent
that
goes
into
the
permanent
fund.
and
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
public
interest
in
trying
to
preserve
as
much
as
this
oil
wealth
for
the
long
term
as
humanly
possible.
now,
it's
easy
to
see
the
political
pressures
on
the
legislature
to
spend
the
money;
we're
all
familiar
with
those.
but
there
was
no
countering
political
pressure
for
the
legislature
to
increase
the
payments
into
the
permanent
fund,
to
put
more
than
the
25
percent
mandated
by
the
constitutional
amendment,
and
to
put
more
of
the
oil
money
in
there
to
be
saved
for
future
generations.
so
the
governor
proposed
what
is
i
call
a
unique
program,
but
it's
perfectly
tailored
to
this
situation.
he
suggested
that
since
the
residents
of
the
state
owned
the
resources,
owned
the
oil
resources,
that
to
the
extent
that
oil
revenues
placed
in
the
permanent
fund
produced
income,
interest
which
was
surplus
to
present
government
needs,
that
those
monies
should
be
distributed
directly
to
the
people.
now,
it's
immediately
obvious
that
when
you
do
that
two
things
happen.
the
first
of
all
is
that
since
the
people
will
receive
dividends
directly
and
only
from
interest
within
the
permanent
fund,
on
monies
placed
in
the
permanent
fund,
it
puts
enormous
pressure
on
the
legislature
to
put
as
much
money
in
the
permanent
fund
as
possible.
now
people
have
a
personal
interest
in
seeing
the
permanent
fund
maximized,
because
they
will
receive
greater
dividends
the
more
and
more
money
is
placed
in
the
permanent
fund.
and
the
second
thing
it
does
is
that
it
creates
in
alaska
the
type
of
check
on
political
spending
which
is
present
in
every
other
state
but
not
present
in
ours.
for
instance,
in
kansas
if
you
want
to
establish
a
government
program,
you
have
to
tax
for
it.
you
have
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
people,
and
it
better
be
a
good
government
program
or
you
better
not
impose
the
tax.
there's
a
political
debit
to
meet
the
political
credit.
in
alaska
since
the
legislature
can
simply
fund
government
programs
through
the
sale
of
oil
leases,
which
people
are
sufficiently
remote
from
that
they
do
not
really
consider
their
own,
that
when
you
transform
those
oil
leases
and
the
money
from
them
into
the
permanent
fund
and
say
to
the
people
there's
going
to
be
money
produced
from
this
oil,
now,
if
it's
surplus
to
the
government
needs
it
will
be
distributed
to
you
in
some
form,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
legislature
can
spend
it.
now,
the
legislature
is
free
to
spend
it--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--yes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
certainly.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
oh,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
marshall.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
not
at
all.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
a
clear
public
purpose
for
the
distribution
of
the
dividends
in
the
first
place.
now,
the
question...
i
tried
to
establish
that
because
once
you
get
to
that
point,
justice
marshall,
then
you
are
trying
to
determine
how
to
distribute
the
dividends,
what
is
the
best
manner
in
which
to
distribute
the
dividends,
certainly
consistent
with
the
14th
amendment.
alaska
has
no
exemption
from
the
14th
amendment,
nor
do
we
claim
it.
now,
in
distributing
the
dividends
the
legislature
selected
a
system
whereby
they
tried
to
make
the
individual
interest
in
receipt
of
the
dividends
identical
with
the
public
interest
in
maintaining
a
long
term
and
healthy
permanent
fund.
now,
let
me
take,
for
example,
justice
marshall,
you
suggest
the
14th
amendment
applies,
and
i
would
suggest,
of
course,
that
the
14th
amendment--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--i
agree
with
you.
the
14th
amendment
requires,
of
course,
that
classifications
be
rational
and
rationally
related
to
valid
public
purposes.
now,
i've
talked
about
the
public
purpose.
now,
let's
think
for
a
moment
about
how
these
dividends
could
be
distributed.
i
don't
think
that
the
14th
amendment
requires
necessarily
that
everyone
be
treated
identically.
the
candidate
in
new
hampshire
who
has
to
wait
for
seven
years
to
run
for
governor
is
not
being
treated
exactly
the
same
as
a
candidate
who
doesn't
have
to
wait.
but
at
the
same
time
it's
a
rational
distinction.
what
we're
talking
about
is
are
the
distinctions
made
in
this
dividend
plan
rational
or
are
they
not
rational.
now,
let's
take
a
perfectly
equal
distribution
for
a
moment.
suppose
the
state
determined
to
distribute
dividends
one
to
each
resident
each
year
regardless
of
how
long
they
had
lived
in
the
state.
now,
if
you
do
that,
it's,
i
think,
immediately
obvious
that,
to
every
resident,
that
as
more
and
more
people
come
to
the
state
of
alaska,
an
individual's
interest
in
a
dividend
distribution,
his
personal
stake
in
the
dividend
fund
is
going
to
decrease.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
but
not
quite
the
same
way.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
not
quite
the
same
way,
justice
stevens.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
it
is
true,
but
less,
substantially
less.
you
have
basically
a
curve
which
goes
up.
now,
all
right.
so
if
the
feeling
is
that
as
more
and
more
people
come
to
the
state
the
individual
dividend
share
will
decrease,
i
think
it's
fairly
obvious--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--no,
not
at
all.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
no.
i
said
the
purpose
of
the
plan,
justice
stevens,
is
first
of
all
to
provide...
of
dividends
at
all...
is
to
provide
an
incentive
for
the
legislature
to
put
a
maximum
amount
of
money
in
the
permanent
fund
and
to
provide
a
check
on
legislative
expenditure
of
the
oil
money.
now,
once
you
have
done
that,
once
you
have
decided
that
the
issuance
of
dividends
is
for
a
valid
public
purpose,
what
you
are
doing
is
using
people's
personal
desire
to
get
the
money
as
opposed
to
be
using
for
a
government
program,
let's
say,
as
an
incentive
to
accomplish
this
fact.
all
right.
you've
done
that.
now,
if
you
take
the
dividends
and
you
distribute
them
on
a
per
capita
basis
each
year,
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
length
of
residency
in
the
state,
each
person,
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
people's
psychology,
the
very
incentive
that
you're
using
here...
personal
desire
to
get
the
money...
isn't
going
to
take
long
that
the
more
people
that
come,
the
less
they're
going
to
get.
now,
they
can't
stop
people
from
coming,
nor
is
there
any
desire
to
stop
people
from
coming.
but
when
you
do
that,
it's
going
to
create
some
other
pressures.
it's
going
to
create,
for
instance,
pressures
on
the
legislature
to
get
the
maximum
money
not
only
in
the
permanent
fund
but
out
of
the
permanent
fund
as
quickly
as
possible;
because
if
they
get
it
now,
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
sharing
it
with
five
million
people
who
will
come
to
alaska
in
ten
years
or
twenty
years.
now,
if
you're
saying
that,
you
know,
people
shouldn't
think
this
way,
you
may
have
a
point;
but
i
think
individuals
do
think
this
way
when
they're
looking
at
money
that
they're
going
to
receive.
so
i
think
that
what
you're
dealing
with
is
people.
you
would
create
by
distributing
dividends
in
a
purely
per
capita
fashion,
you
would
create
the
following
pressures.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
but
there's
one
difference.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
must
be
not
making
myself
clear,
justice
stevens.
if
more
people
come
to
a
state,
they
generate
more
taxes.
you
know,
you
can
argue
about
whether
there
is
benefits
or
detriments
from
large
migrations
into
a
state.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
a
state
population
doubles
from
two
million
to
four
million,
in
theory
your
tax
base
doubles
from
two
million...
you
know,
from
a
base
produced
by
two
million
people--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--absolutely.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
it
wouldn't.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
just
simply
wanted
to
say
in
conclusion
that
but
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
revenues
produced
by
a
finite
resource...
oil.
it
cannot
be
increased.
no
matter
how
many
people
come
to
the
state,
the
amount
of
money
produced
by
that
oil
is
going
to
be
the
same.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
correct.
and
my
point
is
that
if
there's
a
set
amount
of
money
which
is
going
to
come
out
of
the
oil
and
you
issue
the
dividends--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--i
will.
i
would
say
just
quickly
that
this
is
not
a
retroactive
plan.
it's
simply
a
plan
which
is
put
in
medias
res.
i
mean
it's
a
plan
established.
there
are
no
retroactive
rights.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
exactly.
let
me
put
it
this
way,
justice
stevens.
if
the
plan
is
constitutional
vis
a
vis
1959,
you're
going
to
be
facing
exactly
the
same
questions
when
you
come
to
the
year
2000
and
look
back.
they're
the
same
constitutional
issues
which
are
created.
so
far
as
the
feature
of
people
participating
in
the
plan,
a
plan
was
set
up
by
which
people
qualify
for
certain
benefits,
and
they
qualify
whenever
they
came.
a
three
year
resident
will
participate
in
it
on
a
three
year
basis.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
it
would
not
be.
if
it
were
a
one
time
plan
based
on
distribution...
based
on
length
of
residency,
then
you
would--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--it
goes
on
every
year.
every
person...
the
zobels
have
been
in
the
state
for
three
years.
in
18
years
they
will
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
someone
who
came
in
1958
or
'59,
and
their
dividends
will
increase
each
year.
if
no
one
had
that
ability,
if
you
could
not
participate
in
the
program
on
the
same
basis
as
everyone
else
and
increase
your
dividends
just
as
everyone
else
increases
their
dividends,
then
you
would
have
a
one
time
distribution
which
would
favor
one
class
of
people.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
every
citizen--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--they
have
exactly
the
same
rights.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
this
is,
i
think--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--i
think
the
argument
that
the
appellants
are
making,
justice
marshall,
proceeds
on
that
assumption,
that
there
is
a
difference;
but--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--no.
each
party
receives--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--everybody
has
the
same
rights,
justice
marshall.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
everybody
gets
the
same
over
the
same
period
of
residency.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
okay.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
think
this
case,
justice
marshall,
is
about
the
participation
in
a
plan
where
everyone
has
equal
rights
to
receive
the
same
amount
of
cash
over
the
same
period
of
residency
for
certain
valid
public
purposes.
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
on
a
one
year
basis,
yes,
people
get
different
amounts
of
cash,
just
as
under
welfare
systems
people
get
different
amounts
of
welfare
depending
upon
how
they
meet
the
criteria.
and
if
it's
a
valid
public
purpose
for
giving
some
amount
of
welfare
to
one
person
and
some
to
another,
that's
perfectly
valid.
and
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
the
criteria
made
in
the
length
of
residency
to
accomplish
a
valid
public
purpose
is
in
fact
rational.
if
it
is
not...
and
i
gather
from
mr.
sandberg's
suggestion
he
recognizes
it
as
rational.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
for
several
reasons.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
first
instance,
you
must
remember
that
the
distinctions
made
in
the
shapiro
case,
in
maricopa
and
those
cases
depended
on
a
number
of
things,
one
being
that
people
were
divided
into
two
classes...
new
residents
and
everyone
else.
in
this
instance
everyone
is
in
the
same
class...
people
who
were
born
in
the
state
of
alaska,
people
who
moved
to
the
state
of
alaska
at
any
time,
new,
old
residents,
whatever
you
call
them;
they're
all
subject
to
the
same
system.
the
same
distinctions
are
made
between
an
18-year
resident,
a
21-year
resident,
or--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
probably
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
you
were
dealing
with
what's
basically
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
absolutely.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
hardly
think
so.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
oh,
from
alaska?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
hope
so.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
hope
so.
i
don't
know
any
case
that
this
court
has
decided
that
suggests
that
because
a
state
provides
a
certain
benefit
which
is
unknown
elsewhere
on
any
scale,
that
because
someone
wants
to
stay
in
the
state
and
doesn't
want
to
leave
it
that
that
somehow
violates
the
right
to
migration.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
would
say
it
differently.
i
would
say
the
object
is
to
encourage
them
to
stay;
but
if
you
want
to
turn
that
around,
i
suppose
that's
true.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor,
any
more
than
if
one
state,
for
instance,
say
one
state
has
a
welfare
system
which
is
double
any
other
state's
welfare
system.
you
could
say--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--exactly,
yes.
that
makes
it
so
desirable
to
stay
in
that
state
that
you
don't
want
to
leave
that
state
and
go
to
another
state.
i
think
that
would
be
opening
a
can
of
worms
which
has
never
yet
been
opened
by
the
court.
it
would
put
states
in
relative...
you
know,
any
good
program
would
be
considered
constraining
the
right
of
migration
from
the
state.
but
there's
no
impact,
justice
o'connor,
on
the
rights
of
migration
into
the
state.
i
think
that's--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--to
encourage
immigration,
in
essence?
i
suppose
the
public
purpose
to
encourage
immigration...
i
don't
really
know,
justice
burger.
i
don't
think
any
state
has
done
that.
it
has
done
it
with
corporations,
of
course;
and
states
do
provide
tax
incentives
to
corporations.
i
don't
know
of
any
state
that's
ever
done
it
for
people.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
it's
true.
i
mean,
if
you
take
the
analogy
through,
i
assume
states
could
do
it,
but
i
know
of
no
case
that
that's
ever
been
tried.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
the
court
has
certainly
established
the
widest
possible
latitude
for
states
in
dealing
with
tax
exemptions,
and
i
assume
that's
that
sort
of
a
tax...
if
the
state
determined
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
encourage
new
business
to
come
to
the
state,
i
assume
it
could
make
that
sort
of
exemption;
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
which
has
been
specifically
on
that
point.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
don't
know
what
the
public
purpose
of
it
would
be.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
doubt
it.
i
think...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
people
receive
benefits
from
the
state
from
all
sorts
of
programs
which
may
be
rational
or
not
rational
as
the
case
may
be.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
if
you
determined
it
on
its
own
merits,
this
plan
has
a
rational
foundation;
and
the
nature
of
the
dividend
distribution
is
rational.
its
impact
subsequently
on
another
state
program
i
think
is...
i
don't
think
you
can
link
the
two
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
any
more
than
there
would
be
to
any
other
state
benefits
a
state
would
be
giving
out
to
people
that
would
be
rationally
supported.
i
mean
certainly
a
person
that
receives
old
age
benefits
from
a
state
pays
less
income
tax
in
toto
than
someone
who
does
not,
but
because
the
program
is
rational
and
valid,
that
simply
is
what
happens.
it's
not
a
constitutional
issue
over
that.
it
doesn't
result
in
the
income
tax
being
graduated
on
the
basis
of
age.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
you
wouldn't.
i'm
saying
that
therefore...
i
mean,
you
have
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
this
program
in
and
by
itself.
should
you
determine
that
it
is
constitutional,
just
as
you
were
determining
that
old
age
benefits
were
constitutional,
once
you
reach
that
conclusion,
the
fact
that
you
subsequently
impose
an
income
tax
wouldn't
make
it
unconstitutional
any
more
than
you
could
say
that
the
income
tax
was
based
on
age
in
comparison
with
old
age
benefits.
i
mean,
people
who
received
old
age
benefits
pay
less
tax,
but
that,
you
know...
by
deduction
they
pay
less
tax.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
durational
residency,
at
the
outset,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
has
been
only
used
by
this
court,
to
my
knowledge,
in
terms
of
classifying
newcomers
against
old
timers
in
terms
of
states
that
deny
benefits
to
people
who
have
just
arrived
as
opposed
to
people
who
haven't.
and
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
a
question
of
residency
where
it
applies
to
every
single
person
in
the
state
born
any
length
of
time
and
is
not
singling
out
newcomers.
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
the
people
it
applies
to
is
different.
in
all
the
durational
residency
cases
people
are
divided
into
two
classes:
people
who
have
just
arrived
in
the
state
and
everyone
else.
in
this
case--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--there
are
an
infinite
number
of
levels,
justice
o'connor.
everyone
in
this
state
whether
you're
born
there...
i
mean,
the
majority
of
people
of
this
state
have
basically
put
these
distinctions
on
themselves.
this
is
not
some
insular
group
like
newcomers
that
are
being
dealt
with.
this
is
a
distinction
which
has
been
imposed
by
the
majority
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
alaska
on
themselves.
so
you're
not
talking
about
the
kind
of
situation
you
deal
with
in
a
right
to
travel
case
where
you're
talking
about
people
who
travel
to
the
state.
this
as
much
applies
to
people
that
were
born
there.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
couldn't
think
of
a
valid
public
purpose
for
that,
justice
o'connor,
whereas
here,
as
i've
tried
to
indicate,
we
have
a
complex
and
rather
lengthy
scheme
to
deal
with
a
financial
situation
in
the
state
which
is
unique.
but
to
answer
your
question
originally,
you
asked
me
what
would
happen
if
we
came
to
a
compelling
state
interest.
my
initial
answer
was
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest
test.
were
it
to
be
a
compelling
state
interest,
i
could
not
justify
it
here
and
would
not
attempt
to.
there
are
other
ways,
i
am
sure,
that
these
same
ends
could
be
reached
or
at
least
attempted
to
be
reached.
this
is
an
unusual
one
in
an
effort
to
try
something
new,
in
an
effort
to
make
this
work.
you
know,
i
only
have
a
few
minutes,
and
i
just...
did
i
answer
your
question?
as
i
understand
the
principle
which
is
being
advocated
here,
it
is
in
essence
that
the
state
can
never
make
distinctions
based
on
length
of
residency.
that
is
simply
an
erroneous
statement.
i
mean,
this
court
has
upheld
instances
in
which
the
state
has
done
so.
in
chimento
with
the
seven
year
residency
requirement
it
didn't
even
find
it
to
be
a
substantial
federal
question.
and
in
sosna,
aside
from
an
individualized
residency...
i
believe
which
justice
rehnquist
suggested...
that
whether
she
could
prove
individualized
residency
or
not
was
irrelevant
because
iowa
required
that
she
reside
there
for
a
full
year.
so
that
the
flat
statement
is
simply
wrong.
now,
we're
dealing
with,
you
know,
a
federal
constitution.
you're
talking
about
citizenship
rights
which
should
be
expounded
to
the
limit,
to
the
extent
they
are
necessary
to
hold
this
country
together,
to
protect
fundamental
rights,
to
protect
the
kind
of
national
interest
that
you
talk
about
on
a
federal
level.
this
program
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
national
interest.
it
has
no
impact
on
the
right
to
travel
whatsoever,
theoretical
or
real.
you
are
protecting
no
insular
minority
within
this
state
such
as
newcomers
to
the
state
or
a
racial
classification
or
such.
this
is
the
program
that
the
majority
has
adopted
for
themselves,
not
against
a
minority,
not
against
the
poor
or
anyone
else,
but...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
you
have
had
state
statutes
which
are
adopted--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--because
in
this
case
the
class
is
the
majority.
i
know
of
many
unconstitutional
state
statutes
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
majority
against
a
minority
class.
in
this
case
you're
talking
about
a
state
statute
adopted
by
the
majority
to
make
them
the
class,
to
separate
them
into
the
class.
and
all
the
distinctions
i
know
this
court
has
made
have
been
aimed
at
protecting
minority
classifications
against
infringement
by
a
majority.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
majority
and
minority?
no.
but
i
think
the
tests
which
are
imposed--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--yes.
i
think
the
tests
which
are
imposed
by
the
equal
protection
clause,
justice
marshall,
differ,
dependent
upon
the
types
of
classifications
which
are
being
imposed.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
racial
classification,
or
newcomers
to
a
state,
or
recent
migrants,
the
test
is
far
different.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting,
not
that
it
doesn't
apply.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i'm
sorry.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
newcomers.
new
residents--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--no.
it
was
newcomers,
which
were
classified.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
what?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
not
as
a
classification.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no.
not
as
a
classification.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
this
is
about--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--because
people
were
born
there,
and
it
applies
to
them
as
well.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
certainly
then,
i
mean
you'd
have--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--yes.
they're
not
recent
migrants,
unless
you
stretch
the
term
a
bit,
i
think.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
understand.
thank
you
very
much.
