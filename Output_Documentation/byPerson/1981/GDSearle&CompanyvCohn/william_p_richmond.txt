mr.
william
p.
richmond
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
new
jersey
statute
which
places
unique
discriminatory
burdens
on
corporations
which
are
located
entirely
outside
the
state
of
new
jersey.
on
its
face,
the
statute
involved
here
is
one
that
simply
states
that
the
new
jersey
tolling
statute
will
not
run
against
a
corporation...
unless...
i
am
sorry...
will
not
run
as
long
as
the
corporation
is
not
represented
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
our
position
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
tolling
statute
has
been
satisfied
by
the
adoption
in
new
jersey
of
long
arm
jurisdiction
and
service
of
process.
the
statute
also
places
a
heavy
penalty
upon
out
of
state
corporations,
and
finally,
that
the
purported
justifications
for
the
tolling
statute
are
either
fictions
or
are
improper,
and
each
of
these
justifications
could
be
accomplished
in
less
discriminatory
fashions.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
new
jersey
does
have
long
arm
jurisdiction
over
g.
d.
searle
and
company.
that
is
correct.
there
is
also
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
searle
does
not
do
business
within
the
state
for
purposes
of
its
qualification
statute.
tolling
statutes
exist
in
many
states,
but
their
purpose
is
to
protect
a
plaintiff
against
having
his
cause
of
action
lost
as
a
result
of
not
being
able
to
serve
the
defendant
within
the
state,
but
the
new
jersey
statute
has
a
unique
and
critical
difference.
in
new
jersey,
the
only
way
a
foreign
corporation
may
get
the
benefit
of
a
statute
of
limitations
is
by
registering
to
do
business
within
the
state.
this
means
that
new
jersey
denies
the
statute
of
limitations
to
all
corporations
that
may
be
served
by
long
arm
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
yes,
sir.
our
position
is
that
there
is
simply
no
procedure
under
new
jersey
law
by
which
a
corporation
could
appoint
an
agent
for
service
of
process
without
more.
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--no,
but
the
opposition's
position
is
based
upon
a
footnote
in
the
velmohos
case
from
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
the
court
was
not
considering
in
that
footnote
the
extent
of
the
qualification
which
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
appoint
an
agent
for
service
of
process.
all
the
court
was
doing
was
addressing
the
question
of
whether
a
corporation
could
terminate
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
by
appointing
an
agent,
and
the
body
of
the
velmohos
case
makes
it
obvious
that
the
court
was
considering
that
only
two
kinds
of
defendants
could
be
exempted
from
the
statute
of
limitations.
one
was
the
domestic
corporation
and
the
other
one
was
the
one
that
was
licensed
within
the
state.
as
i
say--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--no,
sir.
we
agree
entirely
that
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
the
right
to
interpret
its
statute.
however--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--the
court
of
appeals,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
adopted
obviously
the
interpretation
of
the
new
jersey
law
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
however,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
was
not
addressing
the
point
that
the
respondent
here
is
arguing.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
velmohos
was
not
stating
that
in
fact
the
new
jersey
statutes
permitted
a
designation
of
agents
for
service
of
process
without
more.
as
i
say,
it
was
merely
that
footnote.
the
body
of
the
case
makes
it
obvious
that
what
they
were
addressing
was
the
question
of
only
two
exemptions.
one
was
for
the
domestic
corporation,
and
the
other
was
for
the
corporation
license
in
the
state,
that
is,
qualified.
now,
many
companies,
like
searle,
may
not
be
sued
in
new
jersey
except
under
long
arm
jurisdiction.
all
they
do
in
new
jersey
is
send
their
products
into
the
state
for
eventual
sale,
and
they
promote
the
products.
they
don't
have
offices
there,
other
facilities,
and
they
are
not
doing
business
there.
these
companies
are
subject,
however,
to
product
liability
suits
for...
in
instances
where
citizens
of
new
jersey
claim
that
the
products
have
caused
them
some
harm.
then,
long
arm
jurisdiction
is
available.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
long
arm
jurisdiction
was
in
fact
used
to
serve
process
on
searle.
this
happened
ten
years
after
the
event
which
gives
rise
to
the
cause
of
action
here,
and
four
years
after
the
plaintiffs
concede
that
they
realize
that
they
had
a
cause
of
action,
or
discovered
it.
the
new
jersey
tolling
statute
therefore
has
the
effect
of
never
foreclosing
the
plaintiff's
case
on
limitations
against
corporations
which
may
be
sued
under
long
arm
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
yes,
your
honor,
there
would
perhaps
be
a
latchees
defense,
although
that
is
an
equitable
remedy.
this
is
a
law
case.
but
latchees
would
certainly
be
an
inadequate
substitute
for
the
certainty
and
predictability
of
a
statute
of
defense
based...
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
there
is
simply
no
comparison
between
the
two
defenses
on
the
basis
of
planning
opportunities
for
the
corporation
or
its
ability
to
have
a
reliable
defense
against
liability.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
if
it
were
compelled
to
appoint
a
statutory
agent
for
a
service
of
process,
the
corporation
would
thereby
be
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
new
jersey
law
which
are
applicable
to
domestic
corporations.
it
would
have
to
have
an
office
for
service
of
process.
it
would
have
to
file
reports.
it
would
have
to
pay
franchise
taxes.
furthermore,
and
at
the
heart
of--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--i
don't
believe
it
has
been
resolved
in
any
new
jersey
case,
and
i
believe
the
reason
is
that
there
is
no
new
jersey
statute
which
authorizes
such
a
procedure.
it
is
the
position
of
the
new
jersey
secretary
of
state
and
our
position
in
this
case
that
there
is
simply
no
provision
in
the
law
which
permits
that.
if
you
examine
the
corporation
law,
it
has
only
provisions
which
provide
for
full
scale
qualification,
not
simply
for
designation
of
an
agent
for
service
of
process.
furthermore,
even
if
you
could
only
appoint
an
agent
for
service
of
process,
it
would
still
create
the
problem
of
the
burden
that
we
are
talking
about,
because
the
corporation
would
therefore
be
forced
to
make
itself
available
for
lawsuits
which
would
be
filed
and
would
not
necessarily
satisfy
the
standard
of
minimum
contacts
or
fairness.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
which
doctrine?
our
position
is
that--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--no,
our
position
is
that
minimum
contacts
are
the
touchstone
and
should
be
the
basis
upon
which
any
attempted
requirement
for
licensing
or
other
impact
on
these
foreign
corporations
is
made.
what
would
happen
if
you
submitted
yourself
to
registration
of
an
agent
is
that
lawsuits
could
be
brought
in
new
jersey
which
would
not
necessarily
satisfy
the
minimum
contacts
requirement.
in
new
jersey,
there
is
a
case
to
that
effect,
and
in
this
court
there
is
a
case
to
that
effect.
now,
whether
that
line
of
cases
is
correct
or
not
is
another
matter,
but
as
it
presently
stands,
i
believe
we
would
be
subjecting
ourselves
to
the
risk
of
cases
which
would
not
satisfy
the
standard
that
we
believe
is
at
the
heart
of
this
type
of
attempt
at
regulation.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
we
believe
that
a
state
can
have
a
statute
of
limitations,
but
that
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
for
it
not
to
have
one.
what
we
say
is
that
whatever
statute
of
limitations
it
decides
to
adopt,
it
must
do
so
evenhandedly.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
it
must
be
evenhanded,
your
honor.
it
cannot
discriminate
as
this
one
does
merely
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
you
are
a
foreign
corporation,
and
in
this
instance
we
believe
that
the
statute
of
limitations
which
is
here,
that
is,
with
the
tolling
provision
as
part
of
it,
definitely
does
discriminate.
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
perfectly
free
to
adopt
a
two-year,
four-year,
ten-year,
whatever
statute
of
limitations
or
none
at
all
if
it
chooses,
but
it
must
do
so
evenhandedly,
and
that
is
our
position.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
under
what
provision?
mr.
william
p.
richmond
well,
under--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--this
is
all
three,
your
honor.
this
is
a
commerce
clause
case.
we
contend
that
adoption
of
a
discriminatory
statute
of
limitations
burdens--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
the
commerce
clause
argument.
it
was
certainly
presented
to
the
district
court
in
our
memorandum.
the
district
court
referred
to
it
in
a
footnote
in
its
opinion.
it
found
on
equal
protection
but
said
that
even
aside
from
this
it
would
also
violate
the
commerce
clause.
we
briefed
it
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
ten
pages
of
our
brief
there
were
devoted
to
it.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
they
did
not
necessarily
reject
it.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
they
just
didn't
address
it.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
i
don't
believe
that
they--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--yes,
sir.
they
did
so
on
equal
protection
grounds.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
they
sustained
the
statute
and
addressed
their--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--to
the
extent
that
they
rejected
it,
your
honor,
they
were,
we
feel,
incorrect,
and
we
are
asking
here
that
they
be
reversed
on
the
commerce
clause
argument
and
on
the
other
constitutional
bases
as
well.
now,
what
happens
in
connection
with
the
commerce
clause
is
that
this
does
indeed
constitute
a
heavy
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
the
defendants
are
placed
in
a
position
of
having
the
added
expense
and
the
possibility
of
adverse
judgments
when
new
jersey
defendants
would
not
be
subjected
to
those
risks.
there
is
no
justification
for
this
discrimination,
and
every
one
of
the
legitimate
state
interests
can
be
fully
accomplished
by
less
discriminatory
means.
the
justification
for
the
tolling
statute
has
been
basically
on
the
ground
that
it
makes
it
easier
to
serve
process,
or
that
there
are
purported
difficulties
in
service
of
process
for
new
jersey
residents
against
unrepresented
foreign
corporations.
however,
when
you
look
at
the
justifications,
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
they
are
either
fictional
or
that
they
are
in
themselves
improper.
the
first
of
these
is
that
it
said
that
it
is
harder
to
locate
perhaps
the
out
of
state
defendant.
however,
in
this
case
searle
is
a
fortune
500
company.
there
was
never
any
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
could
be
located.
furthermore,
the
tolling
statute
really
goes
too
far
in
that
it
permits
the
plaintiff
to
avoid
the
statute
of
limitations
indefinitely,
even
though
he
does
indeed
find
out
the
location
of
the
defendant.
decades
could
pass
during
which
the
plaintiff
knew
the
location
of
the
defendant,
and
yet
he
would
not
be
subject
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
problem
of--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--yes,
sir,
to
the
extent
that
latchees
can
be
considered
any
kind
of
adequate
substitute
for
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
problem
of
locating
a
defendant,
were
one
to
exist,
would
also
apply
to
in
state
and
out
of
state
corporations
alike,
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
basis
for
discriminating
only
against
out
of
state
corporations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
fly
by
night
local
corporation
may
often
be
much
more
difficult
to
locate
than
a
national
corporation
which
is
of
the
size
and
visibility
of
a
g.
d.
searle
and
company.
now,
there
are
alternates
in
the
new
jersey
law
which
could
be
adopted
in
order
to
accomplish
the
legitimate
purpose
and
those
include
the
notion
that
since
new
jersey
now
has
a
statute
of
limitations
which
applies
only
when
the
plaintiff
could
reasonably
be
said
to
have
discovered
this
cause
of
action,
it
might
be
said
that
the
plaintiff
would
not
be
subject
to
limitations
until
the
plaintiff
reasonably
discovered
the
location
of
the
defendant.
also
under
existing
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
toll...
the
statute
is
tolled
by
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit,
and
time
is
given
after
that
within
which
to
file
the...
to
serve
the
defendant.
as
a
practical
matter,
cases
are
not
dismissed
in
new
jersey
when
the
plaintiff
reports
that
he
is
trying
to
find
the
defendant
but
has
been
unable
to
do
so.
finally,
i
suppose
the
state
could
adopt
the
statute
which
tolls
only
when
the
defendant
cannot
be
located.
a
second
justification
of
the
three...
there
are
three
justifications
basically
which
have
been
used...
is
that
the
statute
relieves
the
plaintiff
of
his
burden
under
new
jersey
rules
of
satisfying
the
court
that
long
arm
jurisdiction
may
not...
or
that
long
arm
service
may
not
be
made
within
a
state
and
of
filing
an
affidavit
to
that
effect,
but
the
alternative
obviously
is
to
ease
access
to
the
use
of
long
arm
jurisdiction
and
service
of
process.
this
would
lift
any
burden
that
the
plaintiff
has
without
continuing
the
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
for
example,
the
requirement
for
an
affidavit
at
all
could
be
eliminated,
and
that
would
lift
some
of
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff.
it
could
be
adopted,
a
provision
could
be
adopted
whereby
elimination
of
proof
to
the
court
at
all
that
service
of
process
by
long
arm
jurisdiction
isn't
possible
would
be
an
alternative.
i
think
few,
if
any,
states
have
this
affidavit
provision,
probably
because
its
only
purpose
is...
or
the
only
purpose
it
really
serves
is
to
facilitate
harassment
of
the
plaintiff
by
the
defendants
in
connection
with
service.
the
third
and
last
justification
for
the
tolling
statute
is
that
it
relieves
plaintiff
of
the
burden
of
satisfying
the
court
that
long
arm
jurisdiction
or
service
is
consistent
with
due
process.
respondent
is
apparently
saying
that
new
jersey
has
some
interest
in
forcing
the
defendant
to
waive
its
right
to
due
process
or
in
simplifying
litigation
by
eliminating
the
jurisdictional
questions.
this
is
too
heavy
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
the
burden
can't
be
justified
on
the
basis
that
the
state
is
relieving
the
plaintiff
of
satisfying
minimum
contact
requirements.
this
court
in
shaffer
v.
heitner
said
that
cost
is
just
too
high.
none
of
the
justifications
raised
to
support
the
tolling
statute
based
on
the
alleged
difficulty
of
services
justifies
the
indefinite
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations
only
against
out
of
state
corporations.
requiring
plaintiffs
to
utilize
long
arm
jurisdiction
is
a
far
less
burdensome
alternative
to
the
present
tolling
statute,
but
there,
the
respondents
contend
that
this
is
not
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
at
all,
this
tolling
statute.
that
is
just
plain
wrong.
it
is
a
very
heavy
burden,
because
the
corporations
are
subjected
to
having
their
assets
and...
placed
under
constant
jeopardy,
being
subjected
to
suits
and
possibly
judgments
with
local
or
in
state
defendants
would
be
able
to
have
dismissed
on
summary
judgment
or
preliminarily.
the
lower
courts
never
relied
on
this
justification,
presumably
because
they
recognized,
as
this
court
has
held
in
cases
like
allenburg,
that
interstate
businesses
may
not
be
compelled
to
register,
but
the
statute
effectively
requires
a
registration
by
the
corporation.
indeed,
the
plaintiff
argued
in
the
district
court
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
tolling
statute
was
to
compel
registration
by
the
interstate
corporation.
the
defendant
is
faced
with
choices
under
this
tolling
statute
which
we
believe
to
be
improper.
on
the
one
hand,
it
can
fail
to
register,
in
which
case
it
continues
to
suffer
the
burden
that
has
been
imposed
upon
it,
and
may
be
paying
judgments
when
other
corporations
would
not
have
to.
on
the
other
hand,
it
can
qualify
in
new
jersey,
but
by
qualifying,
and
nothing
short
of
qualification
is
available,
by
qualifying,
it
therefore
gives
up
its
right
not
to
be
treated
as
a
domestic
corporation,
and
is
consenting
to
any
and
every
suit,
whether
or
not
it
satisfies
the
minimum
contacts
requirement.
it
is
subjected
also
by
compulsion
to
a
licensing
scheme
with
all
the
attendant
requirements
for
maintaining
an
office,
a
registered
office,
filing
reports,
and
paying
franchise
taxes.
we
also
believe
this
statute
violates--
mr.
william
p.
richmond
--i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
how
it
is
computed.
we
also
believe
that
the
tolling
statute
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
it
is
a
problem
in
that
it
requires
the
corporation
to
give
up
its
fundamental
right
under
due
process
not
to
be
sued
in
the
state
unless
minimum
contacts
are
met,
that
there
is
no
substantial
relationship
between
this
discrimination
and
any
legitimate
state
goal.
i
might
add
that
it
is
important
to
realize
that
even
if
one
were
to
qualify
today,
it
would
not
cure
the
harm
caused
by
the
tolling
statute,
because
for
two
years,
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
the
corporation
would
continue
to
be
subject
to
suits
which
may
have
arisen
many
years
in
the
past
and
are
still
viable
because
of
the
prior
applicability
of
the
tolling
statute.
we
respectfully
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
foregoing
facts
that
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
william
p.
richmond
no,
your
honor.
