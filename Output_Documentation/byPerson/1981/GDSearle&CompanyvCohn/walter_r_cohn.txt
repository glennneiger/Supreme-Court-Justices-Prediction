mr.
walter
r.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
gravamen
of
counsel's
argument
today
appears
to
have
shifted
greatly
from
a
constitutional
argument
to
a
burden
because
they
have
to
register
in
new
jersey,
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
a
proper
statement
of
the
law
of
new
jersey.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
isn't
a
burden,
i
submit
to
this
court,
because
of
the
fact
that
just
because
they
have
representation
in
new
jersey,
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
and
nothing
before
this
court
which
says
that
they
must
register
and
become
domesticated
and
become
subject
to
the
franchise
taxes.
the
franchise
taxes,
mr.
justice,
are
based
upon
our
gross
income
of
the
amount
of
business
done
in
new
jersey.
it
is
a
minimum
tax.
and
they
can
be
exempt
from
that.
there
is
another
section
of
the
new
jersey
corporation
business
act,
part
of
the
act
quoted
by
both
counsel
and
myself,
which
gives
a
reporting
section,
and
i
know
it
is
not
before
the
court,
but
it
is
the
same
act
that
is
before
the
court.
and
in
the
reporting
section,
a
foreign
corporation
has
the
option
of
exempting
itself
from
any
franchise
taxes
by
reporting
and
by
having
a
representative
in
new
jersey
and
by
filing
a
form
with
the
secretary
of
state.
it
is
an
amendment
to
the
act
which
was
passed
in
1973,
and
will
you
indulge
me
by
mentioning
it,
and
permit
me
to,
because
of
the
question
raised
by
the
court
today?
the
searle
company,
just
as
every
other
foreign
corporation,
can
report
to
the
secretary
of
state
filing
the
name
of
their
agent,
filing
the
name
of
their
principal
office.
the
gravamen
of
counsel's
argument
forgets
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
this
tolling
statute
is
so
that
the
plaintiff
can
find
the
out
of
state
defendant.
there
is
no
problem
on
the
in
state
defendant,
as
counsel
says.
they
must
register
with
the
secretary
of
state
to
file
a
certificate
of
incorporation
in
new
jersey,
and
they
do,
and
it
is
a
simple
procedure
to
find
out
the
name
and
the
registered
agent
of
an
in
state
corporation.
just
write
to
the
secretary
of
state.
it
is
a
simple
procedure
to
find
out
the
name
and
address
of
the
representative
of
the
foreign
corporation
if
there
is
a
representative
available,
and
the
very
purpose
of
this
tolling
statute
is
to
have
that
representative
available
so
you
can
find
your
defendant.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
we
submit
there
is,
sir,
and
we
submit
that
justice--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--under
14(a),
there
is
a
provision
for
a
trade
name
certificate
of
a
corporation.
it
has
to
be
renewed
every
five
years.
counsel
for
appellant
has
submitted
to
the
court
a
reply
brief
with
a
letter
for
the
secretary
of
state,
and
i
have
submitted
to
the
court
a
letter
refuting
that
argument.
i
think
there
are
two
provisions--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--we
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
present
that
to
this
court,
because
the--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--i
don't
think
that
there
is,
and
i
didn't
know
that
there
was
a
question,
your
honor.
i
thought
that
it
was
clear.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
no,
sir,
and
i
did
not
think
that
was
a
question.
i
thought
it
was
clear
even
as
a
result
of
justice
pashman's
footnote
number
10
in
the
velmohos--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--no,
sir,
so
i
thought
that
wasn't
before
this
court,
and
i
did
not
think
it
an
issue
to
present
to
this
court.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
fact
issue.
it
is
not
part
of
your
record.
it
is
in
nothing
in
any
of
the
documents
in
this
court
except
for
the
reply
brief,
which
brought
in
a
letter
which
was
not
new
material.
if
the
question
had
arisen
below,
we
would
have
presented
to
the
court
not
only
title
14(a)
but
the
trade
name
certificate
provision
of
new
jersey
in
title
56.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
well,
if
the
burden
is
filing
a
form
with
the
secretary
of
state
for
a
representation--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--it
does
require
a
$15
filing
fee,
and
i
think
the
question
of
$15
is
not
a
burden
under
our
commerce
clause
and
a
burden
upon
the
defendant.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
sir,
and
i--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--any
suit
where
there
was
a
basis
for
the
bringing
of
the
action
in
new
jersey,
bearing
in
mind
the
international
shoe
versus
washington
with
a
minimum
contact.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
think
there
might
be
a
difference
if
the
corporation
raised
the
defense
of
minimum
contacts
and
form
non-convenience,
because
that
is
a
defense
to
any
defendant,
even
if...
even,
your
honor,
if
the
domesticated
corporation
was
sued
in
new
jersey.
that
corporation
can
sue
if
the
accident
was
in
florida
with
the
new
jersey
corporation
being
a
defendant,
new
jersey
being
the
domesticator,
and
a
new
jersey
plaintiff.
under
the
form
non-convenience
of
the
minimum
contacts,
it
could
be
dismissed.
the
volkswagen
case
that
this
court
decided
recently
would
be
extremely
applicable
to
respond
to
your
honor's
question.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
that
agent
is
there
so
that--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--you
are
registered
to
do
business.
even
a
domestic
corporation
could
have
that
as
a
defense,
much
less
a
foreign
corporation
domesticated.
if
the
lawsuit
was
not
properly
brought
in
new
jersey,
it
could
be
at
least
the
plaintiff's
option
to
find
the
defendant
by
having
someone
in
new
jersey
upon
whom
service
can
be
processed.
the
distinction
is
enormous
between
that
and
the
long
arm
statute.
i
think
that
justice
garth
made
it
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
where
he
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
are
agents
under
the
long
arm
and
registered
or
representation
under
the
statute.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
type
of
person.
if
there
is
a
domesticated
corporation,
then
you
have
the
ability
to
serve,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
suit
can
be
maintained.
you
still
have
the
minimum
contacts
rule.
now,
this
court
is
asked
by
the
appellants
to--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--of
course,
sir,
but
then
in
the
situation--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--well,
then
the
situation
is
identical
that
you
hypothesized
to
me
as
in
the
worldwide
volkswagen
versus
the
richardson.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
but
they
had
the
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant.
the
suit
was
brought
in
oklahoma,
even
though
neither
the
plaintiff
nor
the
defendant
were
in
oklahoma.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
sir,
but
then
you
ought
not
distinguish
between
the
long
arm
and
the
purpose
of
this
statute
of
new
jersey,
which
is
to
find
the
defendant.
it
was
fortunate
that
i
could
find
the
defendant
here,
because
it
is
a
well
known
company.
what
about
the
companies,
your
honor,
that
are
not
well
known,
that
are
not
worldwide,
and
fortune
500,
as
counsel
argues?
the
small
company,
which
can
secrete
itself
intentionally
or
not.
the
company
from
out
of
state
that
has
no
identification
on
its
product.
counsel
argues
that
the
tolling
of
the
statute
is
a
detriment
to
a
company
because
there
is
no
response.
there
are
so
many
exceptions
that
have
been
carved
by
the
courts
into
that
argument
at
the
present
time
that
i
present
to
the
court
the
fact
that
even
with
a
two-year
statute,
the
discovery
rule.
in
new
jersey,
we
have
many
cases
on
this
today
which
permits
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
and
maintaining
it.
when
the
event
is
discovered,
that
can
be
ten
years
after
the
two
years,
and
has
been
maintained
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
we
have
insanity.
we
have
minors.
you
have
the
stream
of
commerce
theory.
suppose
the
product
is
sold
by
the
manufacturer,
kept
on
the
shelf
of
the
store
for
ten
years,
purchased
by
the
ultimate
consumer.
five
years
later
the
event
occurs.
there
certainly
would
be
a
maintaining
of
that
lawsuit
in
spite
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
new
jersey.
the
fact
that
we
have
this
fixed
and
fast
rule
of
two
years
is
not
unique
in
new
jersey.
we
have
statute
of
limitations
in
the
50
states,
and
every
one
is
different.
new
jersey
happens
to
be
one
that
has
a
distinction
between
foreign
and
domestic
corporations
with
respect
to
the
statute,
and
the
legislature
made
that
distinction,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
is
a
decision
for
the
state
court
to
determine,
as
it
has
in
velmohos,
and
justice
pashman's
decision
that
that
is
a
proper
distinction.
as
a
result,
we
have
four
types
of
corporations
in
new
jersey
when
it
comes
to
the
tolling
statute.
you
have
your
domestic
corporation,
you
have
your
foreign
corporation
that
is
authorized
to
do
business
in
new
jersey
by
domesticating.
you
have
your
foreign
corporation
that
is
not
domesticated
but
has
a
representative,
as
justice
pashman
says
they
must
have,
and
you
have
the
foreign
corporation
such
as
searle
that
has
not
domesticated
and
does
not
have
a
representative
and
thus
is
subject
to
this
tolling
statute.
the
legislature
has
made
that
decision,
and
we
can
presume
that
searle
must
have
known
about
it
since
1949,
the
last
time
the
tolling
statute
was
amended
by
the
new
jersey
legislature.
the
legislature
did
that
at
the
time
for
a
specific
purpose,
and
i
maintain
to
this
court
that
that
reason
still
remains.
the
burden
upon
searle
or
any
out
of
state
corporation
for
registering
is
one
burden.
the
burden
for
having
a
representative,
which
is
all
that
is
required
to
stop
the
tolling
of
the
statute,
is
another
burden
so
minimal
that
i
maintain
that
that
has
not
in
any
way
affected
the
stream
of
commerce.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
well,
new
jersey
has
not
made
it,
sir.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
they--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
your
honor
has
posed
an
entirely
different
question.
we
have
a
statute
which
i
have
quoted
in
the
brief
on
page
3,
14(a):
13-3,
subpoaragraph
2,
where
the
new
jersey
corporation
act
specifically
provides
that
the
non-registered,
non-domesticating
corporation
in
new
jersey
can
do
many
things.
it
can
maintain.
it
can
defend.
it
can
participate
in
any
action,
any
proceeding,
whether
it
is
judicial,
administrative,
arbitrative,
or
otherwise.
it
can
hold
meetings
of
its
directors.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
because
the
reason,
your
honor,
that
this
defense
is
excluded
is
for
a
purpose.
it
is
to
permit
the
new
jersey
plaintiff
to
find
that
corporation,
and
if
you
exclude
the
contributory
negligence
argument,
i
think
it
may
be
unconstitutional.
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
tolling
statute.
if
you
said
that
the
contributory
negligence
was
tied
into
the
tolling
statute,
i
submit
yes,
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
that--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--latchees
would
be
a
perfect
defense
in
that
instance,
again.
we
can
only
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to...
very
explicit
that
the--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--absolutely,
because
in
this
very
case
after
judge
pashman
issued
his
decision
in
velmohos,
searle
amended
its
pleadings
to
plead
the
defense
of
latchees.
they
filed
a
specific
motion
to
do
so,
and
it
is
part
of
this
case
now
under
the--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--i
am
sorry,
sir?
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
it
makes
it
a
defense.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
no,
sir.
it
is
a
fact
question
then
as
to
what
the
trier
of
the
fact
determines
as
to
whether
it
is
a
proper
defense.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
oh,
yes.
we
have
in
our
court
rules
and
i
think
there
isn't
any
problem
on
this,
that
we
have
specific
defenses
which
must
be
pleaded
in
pleadings
by
our
court
rules,
and
one
of
them
is
latchees.
but
if
you
don't
raise
it,
you
can't
plead
it.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
under
our
court
rules,
it
is
a
law
defense
as
well,
and
under
our
cases
it
is
a
law
defense
as
well.
there
is
no
question
on
that.
it
may
be
traditionally
an
equitable
defense,
but
it
is
certainly
a
defense,
your
honor,
in
a
lawsuit,
in
the
law
side
of
our
courts.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
sir,
and
you
must
by
court
rule
affirmatively--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--yes,
sir.
you
must
affirmatively--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--it
always
can
be
raised.
now,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
defense
to
that
raising
of
the
defense,
your
honor.
if
you
are
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
latchees
would
not
apply,
but
if
you
are
without
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
it
would
apply.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
if
you
are
without
the
defense
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
don't
know
whether
i
answered
your
previous
question.
i
was
cut
off.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
say
that
latchees
applies
in
the
law
side
of
our
courts.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
the
district
court
did
under
the
equal
protection
theory.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
don't
think
that
was
the
district
court's
assumption.
i
don't
think
that
came
up,
your
honor,
until--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--i
think
that
the
real
reason
for
the
district
court's,
if
i
may
submit,
holding
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
was
under
the
equal
protection.
the
trial
judge
in
the
district
court
dealt
solely
in
his
decision...
the
thrust
of
it
was
the
equal
protection
argument,
thus
finding
the
statute
unconstitutional.
he
thought
that
the
defense
was
valid
where
you
have
the
long
arm
jurisdiction,
but
i--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--no,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
all
right.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
sir,
because
without
admitting,
but
for
the
sake
of--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--responding
to
your
honor's
question,
the
domestication
of
the
foreign
corporation
in
new
jersey
is
not
as
burdensome
as
counsel
would
have
this
court
believe.
if
you
do
become
domesticated
in
new
jersey
and
are
subject
to
franchise
taxes,
those
cannot
be
duplicative
taxes.
if
searle
files
in
illinois,
and
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
they
do...
they
are
a
delaware
corporation
with
a
home
office
in
illinois...
wherever
they
file
they
must
pay
taxes
on
their
income.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
think
the
state
under
this
statute
can
say
you
must
have
a
representative
in
the
state,
and
even
if
that
representative
requires
registration
to
the
point
of
domestication,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
not
a
burdensome
event
in
interstate
commerce,
because
if
it
is
really
filing
a
form,
and
because
of
that
form
this
defendant
and
any
other
state
defendant
can
obtain
the
benefit
of
the
tolling
statute,
then
that
is
a
minimum
burden
that
the
defendant
must
bear
if
they
wish
to
raise
this
defense.
they
are
not
prevented
from
doing
business
in
new
jersey.
their
argument
is
that
this
is
a
burden.
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
or
before
this
court
that
it
is
a
burden.
they
have
done
business
to
this
date
and
continue
to
do
business,
and
there
is
no
indication
of
any
loss
of
business
because
to
our
knowledge
there
hasn't
been.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
there
are
many
reasons
that
people
don't
have
benefits
in
a
state,
and
if
this
benefit
doesn't
burden
interstate
commerce,
then
it
is
not
a
burden
under
the
theory
of
the
defendant.
this
burden
is
so
minuscule
if
it
is,
and
i
only
say
if
it
is
because
of
your
honor's
question,
because
i
don't
admit
under
any
theory
that
they
must
domesticate
in
order
to
have
the
benefit
of
this
statute,
they
must
have
a
representative,
and
justice
pashman
in
velmohos
is
quite
clear
about
that.
the
representative
can
be
many
types
of
representatives.
it
is
only
so
that
you
can
write
some
place
where
everyone
knows
and
find
that
person
who
is
authorized
to
accept
service.
if
you
write
to
the
secretary
of
state,
albeit
for
a
registered
agent,
for
a
representative,
for
the
person
trading
as,
you
can
determine
that
person
who
can
accept
process,
and
thus
the
defendant
will
be
able
to
avoid
the
argument
that
they
have
today
and
avoid
the
problem
they
are
in.
presuming
that
there
is
any
burden,
it
is
so
minuscule
that
i
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
such
that
you
can
overturn
a
statute
which
can
easily
be
complied
with.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
couldn't
hear
the
beginning.
i
am
sorry,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
no,
sir.
no.
a
new
jersey
plaintiff--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--well,
in
the
first
place,
the
event
occurred
in
1963.
it
was
not
until
1969-70
that
there
was
any
causal
connection
between
the
ingestion
of
the
birth
control
pill
and
any
trauma
that
could
have
occurred,
the
thrombosis
that
eventually
resulted.
we
have
presented
to
the
district
court,
and
that
issue
really
has
not
been
determined
on
appeal...
it
was
determined
in
a
second
opinion
of
judge
meaner
in
the
district
court...
as
to
whether
there
was
a
discovery
rule
exception.
if
you
take
from
mid-july,
1970,
which
judge
meaner,
the
trial
judge,
found
as
the
discovery
date,
and
you
take
two
years
from
that,
there
is
only
approximately
12
months,
12
and
a
half
months
until
suit
was
started.
there
was
a
valid
reason.
we
have
raised
that
in
the
district
court.
it
is
not
before
this
court,
because
judge
garth
of
the
third
circuit
said,
i
do
not
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
insanity,
quote,
end
quote,
constitutes
a
disability
under
the
tolling
provision
of
a
statute.
we
argued
that
the
emotional
bar
of
the
plaintiff,
susan
cohn,
was
sufficient
so
that
we
could
not
start
this
lawsuit
until
psychiatric
treatment
was
complete
in
1974,
and
that
was
when
we
started
suit,
as
soon
as
we
knew
that
we
were
able
to
psychologically
and
psychiatrically.
now,
that
period
happened
to
be
very
short
in
this
case,
but
that
is
not
the
real
reason
that
this
statute
could
be
argued
as
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
searle
still
has
that
defense
of
latchees,
which
they
even
brought
in
within
the
last
year.
and
if
we
ever
get
to
trial...
we
haven't
had
a
trial
in
this
case,
as
your
honor,
i
am
sure,
knows.
if
we
get
to
trial
i
would
presume
i
have
to
meet
that
defense
at
the
time,
and
am
prepared
to,
for
the
reasons
i
have
just
stated.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
an
incident
that
harms
in
the
stream
of
commerce
to
prevent
the
doing
of
business
of
searle
in
new
jersey
is
one
which
is
so
minimal
that
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
commerce
clause
cannot
apply.
this
court
has
held
that
the
stream
of
commerce
is
just
as
natural
a
force
as
a
stream
of
water,
even
though
it
was
in
justice
brennan's
dissent
where
the
language
came
from,
but
that
is
so
true.
if
this
defendant
is
a
multi-billion
dollar
company,
worldwide
operations,
as
it
claims
in
its
briefs,
then
this
is
a
minuscule
absolutely
minute,
inconsequential
event
that
we
ask
for,
merely
the--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--oh,
absolutely
not,
because
this
must
be
a
broad,
general
principle.
there
are
small
companies
which
can
secrete
themselves
intentionally
or
not
throughout
the
entire
world
where
a
new
jersey
plaintiff
might
want
to
sue
that
defendant.
the
principle
can
certainly
not
be
designated
as
that
which
applies
to
this
case
only,
because
it
happens
that
i
was
able
to
find
searle
in
illinois,
a
delaware
corporation.
i
couldn't
even
have
found
them
if
i
wrote
to
the
illinois
secretary
of
state.
the
very
purpose
of
this
is
so
that
the
legislatures
determine
that
any
new
jersey
plaintiff
can
find
its
defendant.
now,
it
is
quite
significant,
i
think,
that
the
new
jersey
statute
has
said
that
this
is
very
different
than
any
other
situation
where
there
is
a
foreign
corporation.
the
defendant
must
be
found,
and
the
only
way
to
find
it
is
to
have
some
place
where
an
agent
is
in
new
jersey,
very
distinct
from
the
company
doing
business,
as
counsel
argues,
where
they
have
to
have
an
office.
they
don't
have
to
have
an
office
in
new
jersey
in
order
to
comply
with
this
statute.
they
don't
have.
and
there
is
no
one,
in
spite
of
what
counsel
says,
no
place
in
any
case,
no
place
in
any
argument,
no
place
in
any
statute
which
says
they
have
to
be
in
new
jersey
at
all,
except
to
have
a
representative.
now,
that
representative
can
even
be
in
illinois.
a
trade
name
certificate
provides
for
the
service
upon
the
secretary
of
state.
if
i
write
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
trade
name
g.
d.
searle,
and
they
have
a
trade
name
certificate
with
someone
in
illinois,
i
can
serve
the
secretary
of
state.
these
cases
that
searle
cites
are
idiosyncrata
when
they
talk
about
the
motor
vehicle
cases.
in
every
motor
vehicle
case
there
is
an
official
in
a
state
where
you
can
serve.
they
are
distinct.
there
is
no
majority-minority
rule
on
this
issue.
in
the
cases
that
have
upheld
the
tolling
of
a
statute
even
where
you
have
long
arm,
you
have
an
official
in
the
state
in
the
motor
vehicle
cases.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
oh,
yes.
that
is
before
this
court.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
petition
for
certification
on
velmohos.
or
a
motion
for
argument.
i
don't
know
which.
that
is
before
the
court.
and
my
understanding
is,
it
is
being
held
pending
the
decision
in
this
case,
but
that
is
just
what
i
was
told.
there
are
several
cases,
your
honor,
before
this
court
on
the
same
issue.
there
is
a
companion
case--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--yes,
sir.
there
is
a
companion
case
that
judge
garth
decided
in
the
third
circuit,
the
hopkins-kelsey-hayes.
there
is
the
cumbs
honda
case
which
is
before
this
court.
they
all
involve
the
same
issue.
and
they
are
all
pending
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
so
far,
this
court
is
asked
to
overturn
the
third
circuit
on
the
issue,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
on
the
issue,
the
u.
s.
district
court,
judge
brockman
in
the
kelsey-hayes
case
on
the
issue,
all
cases
upholding
the
statute.
and
the
only
one
who
did
not
uphold
the
statute
is
my
trial
judge
in
my
case,
and
he
did
it
for
a
different
reason.
he
stated
that
the
long
arm
was
sufficient
to
obtain
jurisdiction
so
the
statute
should
not
toll.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
whether
there
isn't
or
there
has
been,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
statistics
to
give
to
you,
your
honor,
but
whether
there
has
or
there
hasn't
is
immaterial--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--no,
sir.
the
occasion
has
not--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--i
have
not
had
occasion,
but
i
have
written
to--
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
--in
30
years,
i
have
had
occasion
to
write
to
the
secretary
of
state
as
to
whether
the
foreign
corporation
had
a
trade
name
certificate,
whether
the
foreign
corporation
had
any
kind
of
person
in
new
jersey.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
the
occasion
hasn't
arisen.
it
just
hasn't.
but
i
have
been
able
to
serve
by
long
arm,
as
i
did
in
this
instance.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
now,
it
just
happens
i
could
find
the
defendant.
that
was
a
fortuitous
circumstance.
but
that
should
not
make
an
exception
to
the
rule
to
make
this
statute
invalid.
the
principle
remains
as
to
the
fact
that
you
have
to
have
somebody
in
new
jersey,
and
justice
pashman
is
so
clear
about
that.
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
occurred
before,
i
can
only
answer
your
honor
with
the
fact
that
this
issue
hasn't
appeared
before
this
court,
although
our
statute
was
passed
in
1820.
why
it
has
come
up
now,
a
matter
of
circumstance.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
don't
know
the
question
that
petitioner
asked.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
i
don't
know
the
question
asked,
your
honor.
i
can
ask
a
question
and
i
am
sure
i
can
get
different
answers
from
witnesses.
if
i
had
asked
the
question,
is
there
a
procedure,
and
can
i
file
a
name
as
an
out
of
state
defendant,
if
given
the
opportunity,
i
might
get
a
different
answer.
this
did
not
come
up
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
until
a
week
ago
today
when
i
received
that
reply
brief
of
the
appellant.
there
has
never
been
an
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
defendant,
searle,
can
merely
file
a
registration
and
have
a
registered
agent
or
a
person
to
designate
service.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
walter
r.
cohn
thank
you.
