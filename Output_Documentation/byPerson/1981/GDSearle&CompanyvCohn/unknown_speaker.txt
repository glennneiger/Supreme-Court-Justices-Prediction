unknown
speaker
there
is
no
question,
mr.
richmond,
is
there,
that
searle
does
business
in
new
jersey,
and
is
subject
to
the
long
arm
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
richmond,
does
your
opposition
agree
with
that?
i
take
it
it
is
your
position
that
to
appoint
an
agent
for
service,
you
must
qualify
to
do
business
within
the
state
of
new
jersey.
unknown
speaker
does
your
opposition
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
any
question
about
the
new
jersey
law
here,
certainly
we
can't
determine
it,
can
we?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
court
of
appeals,
though?
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
anything
to
say
about
it?
the
third
circuit?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
there
would
still
be
some
kind
of
a
latchees
defense,
i
suppose,
eventually.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
other
effects
on
the
company
if
it
went
ahead
and
appointed
a
statutory
agent
in
new
jersey
for
service?
unknown
speaker
has
that
been
resolved
in
any
particular
new
jersey
case?
it
is
not
possible
to
merely
designate
some
statutory
agent
there,
without
more?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
that
doctrine
would
then
no
longer
be
applicable?
unknown
speaker
the
minimum
contacts
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
richmond,
isn't
there
also
inherent
in
your
argument
the
claim
that
a
state
must
have
a
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
an
equal
protection.
unknown
speaker
under
what
provision?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
does
the
due
process...
equal
protection
or
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
reject
all
of
those?
unknown
speaker
so
they
necessarily
rejected
it,
though.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
presented
it,
you
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
they
sustained
the
statute
over
your
objection.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
they
did
so
on
equal
protection
grounds?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
they
can't
sustain
the
statute
unless
they
reject
all
of
your
constitutional
arguments.
unknown
speaker
but
he
would
be
subject
to
latchess
in
those
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
mr.
richmond,
how
is
the
franchise
tax
computed
in
new
jersey?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
that
is
a
constitutional
question,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
provision
in
the
new
jersey
statutes
that
permits
designating
an
agent
for
service
without
registering
as
a
foreign
corporation?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
the
citation?
unknown
speaker
does
the
secretary
of
state
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
sound
as
though
there
were
a
question
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
mention
it
either
way.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
even
presented
in
the
velmohos
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
you
are
right,
that
they
wouldn't
have
to
register,
they
would
just
have
to
designate
an
agent
for
service
of
process.
then
you
are
arguing
there
that,
well,
that
is
an
additional
burden
that
they
have
to
go
through,
but
it
is
not
much?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
it
is
a
trivial
burden.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
designate
the
agent,
as
you
suggests,
and
pay
your
$15.
then
you
have
an
agent
for
service
of
process
in
the
state.
unknown
speaker
and
with
respect
to
what
kind
of
suits
could
the
registering
corporation,
could
the
designating
corporation
be
sued
in
new
jersey
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
say,
though,
that
suppose
there
are
two
corporations.
one
is
fully
registered,
fully
registered,
qualified...
and
then
the
other
one
has
just
designated
an
agent
for
service
of
process,
as
you
suggest.
now,
could
those
two
corporations
be
sued
in
new
jersey
on
precisely
the
same
kind
of
cases,
or
would
there
be
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know,
if
you
have
designated
an
agent
for
service
of
process.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
have
registered
to
do
business?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohn,
i
don't
really
quite
understand
your
argument.
putting
aside
for
one
moment
the
form
non-convenience
argument,
which
i
understand
would
be
a
different...
just
the
jurisdictional
argument,
supposing
this
plaintiff,
living
in
new
jersey,
had
been
in
florida
and
had
an
accident
with
one
of
the
defendant's
vehicles.
if
searle
were
registered,
would
not
the
plaintiff
be
able
to
obtain
jurisdiction
over
searle?
unknown
speaker
then
that
is
a
different
situation,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
there
they
could
have
the
case
dismissed
because
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant.
the
defendant
had
not
registered
in
the
forum
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
purported
to
exercise
jurisdiction
through
the
long
arm
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohn,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
new
jersey
said
that
an
unrepresented
foreign
corporation
may
not
have
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence,
say?
would
have
the
same...
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
the
same
thing,
comply
with
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
am
just
asking
you,
how
would
you
deal
with...
would
that
statute
also
be
constitutional
on
the
same
theory
that
this
one
is?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
all
that,
but
it
may
not
assert
one
defense
that
all
other
defendants
can
assert,
namely,
the
statute...
i
am
just
asking,
why
wouldn't
the
same
reasoning
apply
to
a
second
offense,
contributory
negligence?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
your
case
allows
tolling.
say
it
takes
five
years
to
find
a
defendant,
and
you
spend
the
five
years
finding
him,
and
then
you
say,
well,
i
will
wait
another
ten
years
to
sue.
he
may
wait
much
longer
than
the
time
required
to
find
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
latchees
is
a
defense
in
an
action
at
law?
unknown
speaker
does
that
make
latchees
proper?
unknown
speaker
does
that
make
latchees
proper?
unknown
speaker
it
makes
it
a
defense
which
searle
conceived
of.
that
doesn't
mean
it
would
be
sustained
by
the
new
jersey
courts,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
you
don't
think
of
latchees
as
being
a
defense
to
an
action
at
law.
unknown
speaker
but
ordinarily
in
an
action
on
the
law
side
where
you
are
seeking
damages,
you
have
statutes
of
limitations,
not
latchees.
latchees,
at
least
to
my
mind...
perhaps
i
am
wrong...
is
an
equitable
defense.
unknown
speaker
you
plead
latchees
and
the
statute
of
limitations
in
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
you
plead
them
both?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
you
still
can
say
latchees?
unknown
speaker
for
example,
if
the
statute
of
limitations
is
five
years,
and
you
filed
in
four
years,
somebody
could
still
raise
latchees?
unknown
speaker
you
said
latchees
always
applies.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
heard
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
district
court...
the
district
court
invalidated
the
statute,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
didn't...
wasn't
its
assumption,
at
least,
that
the...
that
there
was
no
provision
for
just
filing
a
name,
designating
an
agent?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
awful
close
to
it
in
footnote
17
of
its
opinion.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
what
would
your
position
be...
i
suppose
it
would
be
the
same...
that
there
is
under
new
jersey...
the
only
way
you
could
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
to
fully
register.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
was
the
only
way
that
a
foreign
corporation
could
do
it.
suppose
you
had
to
make
a
choice
either
between
the
statute
of
limitations
or
registering.
you
just
couldn't
designate
an
agent.
suppose
that.
unknown
speaker
you
still
would
argue
for
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
a
state
could
say
to
a
corporation
that
is
engaged
only
in
interstate
commerce
in
new
jersey,
that
is
the
only
kind
of
business
it
does
in
new
jersey,
do
you
think
the
state
could
say,
well,
we
wish
you
would
register,
and
if
you
don't
we
are
going
to
charge
you
$10
a
year?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
way
it
is
a
burden
is
that
they
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohn,
was
there
any
attempt
to
institute
litigation
for
this
injury
other
than
this
particular
suit?
unknown
speaker
was
this
new
jersey
litigation
the
only
one
attempted
against
searle
for
the
injury
that
mrs.
cohn
sustained?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
attempt
to
sue
them
elsewhere?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
wait
so
long?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
make
the
question
turn
on
the
net
worth
of
the
company,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohn--
unknown
speaker
--was
any
effort
to
review
velmohos
sought
here?
unknown
speaker
now?
unknown
speaker
all
involving
the
new
jersey
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
do
all
of
them
sustain
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
submit
that
is
a
very
different
thing.
the
long
arm
is
a
court
rule.
the
statute
is
a
legislative
enactment.
one
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
other.
the
long
arm
rule,
enacted
in
1958
in
new
jersey,
was
certainly
known,
but
that
is
only
where
you
can
find
the
defendant.
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
obviate
the
situation
in
the
long
arm
rule
instance,
where
you
can't
find
the
defendant,
where
the
defendant
must
come
to
new
jersey,
at
least
have
somebody
for
process,
and
that
is
what
we
are
after
here,
the
maintaining
of
the
ability
to
find
the
defendant,
big
corporation,
little
corporation,
regardless
of
the
incident.
that
is
the
penalty
the
defendant
has
to
pay
for
not
having
some
representative
in
new
jersey.
do
you
think
there
is
any
filing
with
the
secretary
of
state
in
all
the
years
that
new
jersey
has
been
in
business
just
designating
an
agent
for
service
of
process?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
tried
to
find
one?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
tried
to
serve
a
foreign
corporation
based
only
on
its
trade
name
certificate?
unknown
speaker
in
all
the
years
that--
unknown
speaker
--did
they
ever
answer,
yes,
it
has
a
trade
name,
and
then
you
tried
to
serve
them?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
this
letter
that
the
petitioner
appends
to
the
reply
brief
suggest
that
at
least
the
department
of
state--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
statement
is
pretty
flat,
isn't
it?
please
be
advised
it
is
the
view
of
the
department
of
state
that
unless
a
foreign
corporation
has
qualified
to
do
business
in
new
jersey,
they
are
unable
to
designate
a
registered
agent
for
service
of
process.
