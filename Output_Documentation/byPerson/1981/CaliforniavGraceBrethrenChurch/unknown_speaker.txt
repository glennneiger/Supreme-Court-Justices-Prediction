unknown
speaker
although
the
missouri
synod
lutherans
are
here,
with
a
brief,
anyway,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
was
the
free
exercise
claim
presented
below?
unknown
speaker
not
ruled
on?
unknown
speaker
rejected
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
cross-appeal
on
that
issue?
unknown
speaker
do
we
get
to
this
issue
until
we
decide
whether
the
tax
injunction
act
bars
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
shouldn't
we
address
that
before
we
get
to
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
you
going
to
discuss
it
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
position,
and
i
guess
that
of
the
state
as
well,
it
is
that
the
declaratory
judgment
action
was
barred
by
the
tax
injunction
act,
and
yet
for
some
reason
we
can
nevertheless
reach
the
merits
of
the
religious
clause
question.
how
do
we
do
that?
how
do
we
get
that
jump?
unknown
speaker
first
of
all,
am
i
right
that
you
do
say
the
tax
injunction
act
bars
a
declaratory
judgment
action?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
government's
position?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
we
should
reach
the--
unknown
speaker
--how?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
even
if
we
have
jurisdiction,
doesn't
the
tax
injunction
act
apply
to
us
as
well
as
to
the
district
court,
and
we
would
in
effect
be
giving
a
declaratory
judgment,
which
is
prohibited
by
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
court
could
freely
exercise
its
equitable
powers
and
grant
injunctions
as
if
the
tax
injunction
act
didn't
exist,
on
a
review
of
a
district
court
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mrs.
shapiro,
i
gather
the
district
court
certainly
is
barred
from
granting
any
kind
of
relief,
is
it
not,
by
the
tax
injunction
act?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
can
we
grant
any?
unknown
speaker
and
we
can't
send
it
back
to
them
to
grant
it,
because
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
a
declaratory
judgment,
since
you
do
agree
that
the
tax
injunction
act
bars
a
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
we
might
have
jurisdiction
on
the
appeal,
that's
right.
but
what
is
open
on
the
appeal?
the
first
question
that's
open
on
the
appeal
is
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction,
and
if
it
did...
and
if
it
did,
why,
we
get
to
the
merits;
if
it
didn't,
i
don't
know
why
you
wouldn't
just
vacate
the
district
court's
judgment.
unknown
speaker
that'll
get
rid
of
what
worries
you,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
then
there
isn't
any
injunction.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
sounds
to
me...
really,
mrs.
shapiro,
so
often
we
get
lawyers
standing
where
you
are
who
tell
us,
well,
maybe
there
isn't
any
jurisdiction,
but
we
really
want
to
have
you
decide
it
anyway.
and
that
sounds
like
the
same
kind
of
argument
to
me,
if
i
may
say
so.
unknown
speaker
on
what
basis
was
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
certainly
was
jurisdiction
in
one
district
court
or
the
other
there,
one
kind
of
a
district
court
or
the
other.
there
wasn't
any
question.
but
here
the
question
is
whether
district
courts
in
general
have
any
authority
to
do
what
this
court
did.
unknown
speaker
what
particularly
do
you
want
us
to
do?
what
order
do
you
want
us
to
give?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
reach
the
merits?
to
reverse
the
incorrect
judgment.
unknown
speaker
and
tell
the
district
court
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
tell
them
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
we
tell
the
district
court,
you
don't
have
jurisdiction,
but
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
satisfy
your
purposes
if
we
directed
them
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
always
resolve
every
question
as
soon
as
it
arises,
as
you
know.
sometimes
we
wait
until
we
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
shouldn't
we
decide
both
questions,
though,
or
at
least...
i
don't
know.
would
you
say
it
would
be
all
right
with
you
if
we
said,
well,
they
were
wrong
on
the
merits,
but
also
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
question
was
case
or
controversy?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
would
be
one
thing
if
we
hadn't
construed
the
tax
injunction
act
to
extend
to
declaratory
judgments
as
well
as
injunctions.
but
here
the
district
court
had...
the
only
thing
the
district
court
could
do
was
issue
one
or
the
other.
it
couldn't
get
away
from
home
base,
under
the
tax
injunction
act.
it
just
couldn't,
couldn't
do
a
thing,
the
way
we've
construed
the
tax
injunction
act;
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
an
exception
to
the
tax
injunction
act?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
would
you
say
an
exception
or
that
there
is
no
adequate
state--
unknown
speaker
--within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
this
i
gather...
well,
which?
because
what's
available
in
the
state
courts
is
not
an
adequate
remedy?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
primarily
it's
because
what's
being
challenged
here
as
violative
of
the
federal
constitution
is
not
a
state
statute,
but
it's
a
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
basically
it's
the
futa,
isn't
it,
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
it's
rather
strange
that
you
be
remitted,
litigants
be
remitted,
to
a
state
court
to
decide
the
federal
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute
under
the
statute
constitution,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
unique
about
a
state
court
deciding
a
federal
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
get
this
clear.
you're
not
asking
really
for
an
exception?
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
say
that
it's
not
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any...
was
there
a
jurisdictional
issue
raised
below?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
and
now
it
supports
it...
no,
it
doesn't.
no,
it
doesn't.
but
what
did
the
district
court
say,
though?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
go
on
your
grounds?
unknown
speaker
they
disagreed
with
your
ground.
unknown
speaker
so
you
never
presented
that
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
but
you're...
excuse
me.
i
was
going
to
say,
you
cite
the
st.
martin's
case
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
was
the
government
a
party
there?
unknown
speaker
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
st.
martin's
decision
is
a
nullity,
then,
because
the
government
was
not
a
party?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
the
church
related
schools.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
far
as
determining
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
statute,
which
i
take
it
is
what
you're
interested
in,
why
was
the
federal
government
a
necessary
party?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
had
to
be,
but
i
still
don't
see
why
an
action
by
the
plaintiffs
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
california
statute
required
anybody
but
california
and
the
plaintiffs.
it
would
have
been
more
convenient,
certainly,
for
the
state
to
have
the
federal
government
a
party.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
they'
re
indispensable.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
may
have
to
be
tossed
out.
unknown
speaker
the
anti-injunction
act,
as
i
understand,
applies
to
injunction
against
a
federal
statute
as
well
as
a
state
tax
statute.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
provision
in
some
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
if
an
employer
in
a
type
three
or
category
three
school
says,
we
want
only
teachers
who
will
speak
with
enthusiasm
and
sincerity
about
our,
the
employer's,
religious
beliefs.
certainly
the
employer
has
a
right
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that's
a
work
rule.
now,
if
the
employee
doesn't
measure
up
to
it
he
would
be
discharged
for
misconduct,
i
presume,
under
california
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
that
the
employer
had
done
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
contrary
to
his
beliefs,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
contrary
to
the
employee's
beliefs,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
make
any
point
of
the
distinction
here?
church
affiliated
schools,
as
i
understand,
get
the
exemption--
unknown
speaker
--that's
right,
isn't
it?
but
a
group
that's
not
so
affiliated
is
denied
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
what's
your
position
about
that
difference
in
classification?
unknown
speaker
well,
nevertheless,
what
level
of
scrutiny
do
you
apply
to
that
distinction?
rationality
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we
didn't
have
a
religious
classification.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
it
does
grant
benefits
to
certain
kinds
of
religious
organizations
and
deny
them
to
others,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
sort
of
abuse
the
kind
of
thing
that
has
led
us
to
suggest
strict
scrutiny?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
ball,
are
you
going
to
address
the
1341
jurisdictional
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
you
don't
get
to
entanglements,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
very
skillful
argument
about
entanglement,
but--
unknown
speaker
--you're...
sooner
or
later
you
can
get
around
to
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
case
turned
on
that,
turned
on
that,
wouldn't
the
district
judge
really
be
the
place
to
present
that?
the
district
court
knows
more
about
local
law
and
the
adequacy
of
remedies
than
we
do.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
there.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
there
was
one,
though.
unknown
speaker
and
this
argument
was
never
presented.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
this
argument
about
the
adequacy
of
remedy.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
district
court
must
have
rejected
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
i
know.
but
i
thought
there
was
a...
i
thought
i
heard
from
one
of
the
people
speaking
before
that
this
particular
reason
for
sustaining
jurisdiction
was
never
presented
to
the
district
court,
that
there
was
no
adequacy
remedy
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
did
he
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
the
injunction
act's
no
bar.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ball,
you
could
have,
i
suppose,
obtained
some
form
of
relief
in
california,
for
instance
paying
some
portion
of
the
tax
and
suing
to
recover
it,
or
following
administrative
remedies,
could
you
not,
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
at
least
paying
the
tax
and
then
litigating
the
validity?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
do
concede
there
was
a
way
to
get
the
california
courts
to
rule
upon
the
question?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
see
how
that
inquiry
would
be
relevant
in
the
category
three
schools.
unknown
speaker
whether
you're
totally
religious
or
only
partially
religious,
under
the
state
and
federal
government's
view,
you
have
to
pay
the
tax.
unknown
speaker
that
included
category
one
and
category
two
schools?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
only
problem,
as
i
can
see
it
anyway,
would
be
with
respect
to
category
one
and
category
two
schools.
if
you're
in
category
three,
you
must
pay
the
tax
whether
you're
entirely
religious
or
only
partially
religious.
unknown
speaker
but
as
of
now
we're
only
concerned
with
category
three.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ball,
may
i
get
back
just
a
moment
to
this
jurisdictional
question.
i
gather
you
and
the
government
have
a
different
position
about
that.
as
i
understood
mrs.
shapiro,
the
federal
government's
position
is
that,
no,
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
it
was
barred
by
1341,
but
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction
under
1252.
your
position,
i
gather,
is
that,
no,
1341
was
inapplicable
because
there
was
no
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
under
state
law;
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
have
that
difference
with
th
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
me
where
in
the
district
court's
several
opinions
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
is
addressed?
unknown
speaker
i've
got
it,
i've
got
it.
0....
actually,
i
suppose
it's
the
top
of
67
applies
to
your
particular
argument.
but
i
still
don't
quite
understand,
in
the
response
to
the
question
of
justice
o'connor,
why
you
could
not
have
done
what
the
amish
did
in
the
lee
case,
have
paid
a
small
amount
of
tax
and
then
gone
into
a
california
court
and
said,
we
want
a
refund
of
that.
i
don't
know
why
you
had
to
fight
out
any
particular
discharge
issue
in
a
refund
suit.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
the
amish
felt
the
same
way
in
their
case,
mr.
ball?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
you've
read
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
you
know
that
the
argument
was
based
on
constitutional
grounds.
and
that's
often
true
of
statutes
involving
taxes
that
are
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds.
how
is
your
problem
any
different?
unknown
speaker
but
a
state
court
could.
could
you
have
sought
declaratory
relief
in
california?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
sought
declaratory
relief
in
the
california
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
and
ask
them
to
declare
it
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
as
plain
and
speedy
and
adequate
as
having
the
federal
court--
unknown
speaker
--pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
contrary
to
rosewell
last
year,
rosewell
versus
lasalle
national
bank,
that
you
may
not
be
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
if
there's
an
otherwise
adequate
state
remedy
that
will
ultimately
determine
the
claims
you
want
to
make?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
rosewell
they
thought
they
had
substantial
constitutional
claims.
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
gradation
of
constitutional
claims?
unknown
speaker
what's
your
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
that
due
process
of
law
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
subordinate
to
these
rights
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think,
then,
that
for
some
constitutional
claims
the
1341
does
not
require
anything
more
than
the
usual
statement
state
remedy,
but
for
others
it
does?
unknown
speaker
or
speech,
or
speech.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that,
cases
from
this
court
construing
1341?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
if
first
amendment
rights
have
priorities,
what
is
number
two?
which
one
of
the
amendments
is
number
two?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
make
one
if
you
can't
make
two?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
you're
grading
them,
how
can
you
grade
one
when
you
can't
grade
the
others?
unknown
speaker
well,
read
me
where
this
court
said
that
first
amendment
rights
have
priority
over
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
what
in
cantwell
versus
connecticut
said
that?
unknown
speaker
you
said
over
everything.
well,
that's
true
of
all
constitutional
provisions.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ball,
i
think
your
view
that
the
establishment
clause
is
entitled
to
special
value
in
the
hierarchy
of
constitutional
values
was
strongly
supported
by
the
dissent
in
the
valley
forge
case,
but
unfortunately
the
majority
went
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
i
did,
too.
unknown
speaker
an
argument
much
like
yours
was
made
in
henderson
against
wallace
and
someone
else,
that
is,
that
the
very
inquiry
in
the
pretrial
discovery
as
to
what
information
the
media
had
which
they
didn't
disclose
was
a
"entanglement"
type
of
thing,
which
couldn't
be
made.
but
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
the
courts
must
always
make
the
initial
inquiry,
even
if
it
involves
some
entanglement.
otherwise,
the
claim
of
entanglement
would
be
a
barrier
to
any
inquiry
under
the
true
facts.

not
so
different
from
henderson
against
landow
and
wallace...
is
the
title
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
it's
in
quite
a
different
setting.
that's
in
labor
relations.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ball,
is
this
an
equal
protection
argument?
unknown
speaker
and
you
suggest
the
level
of
scrutiny
is
compelling,
not
rationality?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
another
problem,
just
to
get
your
view
on
it.
what
about
when
the
government
is
made
a
party
and
then
removes
the
case
to
the
federal
court?
how
can
the
state
remedy
be
adequate
then?
unknown
speaker
but
unless
you
take
the
view
that
the
court
necessarily
decided
the
federal
constitutional
question,
which
would
make
you
a
proper
party,
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law.
unknown
speaker
then
wasn't
the
united
states
an
appropriate
party
and
unable
to
remove?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
however,
mrs.
shapiro,
there
may
be
some
state
requirement
that
work
rules
be
reasonable,
and
to
that
extent
might
not
you
have
to
get
into--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
dealt
with
religious
requirements,
to
that
limited
extent,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
put
the
thing
in
the
posture
of
an
examination
of
doctrine.
