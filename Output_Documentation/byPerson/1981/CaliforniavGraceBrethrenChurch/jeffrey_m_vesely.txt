mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wish
to
clarify
first
the
state
of
california's
position
with
respect
to
the
1341
issue
that
was
raised
by
the
court
here.
what
must
be
kept
in
mind
is
that
a
plain,
speedy
and
adequate
remedy
must
be
available
at
state
law
and
state
court
before
the
tax
injunction
act
arises
here.
now,
the
state's
position
is
very
simply
this,
is
that
the
federal
government...
there
was
relief
sought
against
the
federal
government
directly
in
this
case.
there
was
injunctive
relief
sought,
declaratory
relief
sought.
a
federal
statute
was
being
challenged.
the
federal
government
could
not
be
compelled
to
litigate
any
kind
of
these
issues
in
state
court
if
it
didn't
wish
to.
in
fact,
the
federal
government
did
remove
one
of
these
two
cases,
the
lutheran
case,
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
so
basically
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that,
like
was
noted
in
your
java
decision
of,
i
think,
402
u.s.,
where
in
a
footnote
towards
the
end
of
the
decision
at
page
135
it
was
noted
that
to
accord
complete
relief
to
the
plaintiffs
in
that
particular
case
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
should
have
been
a
party
in
the
action
as
well.
and
the
state
would
submit
that
as
a,
for
better
use
of
a
term,
as
an
exception
to
this
case
so
that
the
court
could
reach
the
merits,
which
everybody
wishes--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--to
the
tax
injunction
act.
is
basically
on
the
terms
of
the
tax
inunction
act--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--well,
i
would
say
that
the
exception--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--is
probably
an
improper
word.
i
think,
justice
brennan,
that
it's
probably
that
it
just
doesn't
meet
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
in
this
particular
case.
this
case
was
unique
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
both
the
federal
and
state
statutes
were
challenged.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
this
is
true.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
this
is
the
position
we're
taking,
and
especially
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
position...
excuse
me...
that
the
state
of
california
took
in
this
case,
the
conformity
process
that's
inherent
in
futa
came
into
play--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--well,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
unique
about
that,
other
than
the
fact
when
you
have
the
federal
government
having
to
be
a
party
in
the
action,
because
there
was
relief
sought
against
them.
i
believe
at
that
point
there,
that's
when
the
tax
injunction
act
becomes
inapplicable.
and
i
think
that
as
a...
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
i
think
that's
the
only
reasonable
way
to
look
at
this
case.
i
think
an
exception,
because
of
the
importance
of
the
case--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--no,
i
am
not.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
yes,
it
was
raised.
the
federal
government
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
the
district
court
found
a--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--no.
what
we
argued
below,
we
asked--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--well,
our
ground
was
actually
raised
that
we
wished
for
them
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
case
as
well.
i
think
the
ground
that
we're
raising
right
now
is
just
looking
at
the
statute,
and
actually
xx--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--not
exactly
this
ground,
that's
true.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
the
government
was
not
a
party
in
the
st.
martin's
case,
and
i
think
that
the
point
raised
by
the
federal
government
in
their
reply
brief
of
speaking
of
why
st.
martin's
was
quite
appropriate
to
go
up
and
have
federal
questions
decided
in
that
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
our
case,
because
of
the
relief
that
was
sought,
as
i
said,
against
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
was
not
a
party
in
st.
martin's.
strictly
a
tax
issue
was
not
exactly
the
point
of
st.
martin's.
it
is
the
question
of,
to
accord
complete
relief
to
the
plaintiffs,
if
it's
proper,
the
only
way
the
plaintiffs
could
have
gotten
complete
relief
would
have
been
to
stay
in
federal
court.
we
submit
that
they
should
not
get
the
relief.
we
make
it
very
clear,
though,
but
on
the
merits.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
no,
i
do
not.
the
state
statute
was
being
challenged
there,
south
dakota
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
in
our
case
here?
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
church
related
and
also
just
merely
religiously
related.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
because
the
federal
statute
was
being
challenged
as
well,
and
the
state,
because
of
the
conformity
process
that
the
federal
unemployment
tax
program
has,
where
the
state
has
to
comply
with
what
the
federal
government
says
or
be
held
out
of
conformity
and
therefore
forfeit
millions
of
dollars
per
year,
perhaps,
in
various
moneys
that
they
get
from
the
federal
government.
the
state
initial
position
in
this
case...
and
it
actually
is
not
really
different,
except
that
part
of
the
case
has
been
resolved,
the
category
one
and
category
two
schools...
the
state
was
aligned
essentially
with
the
church
related
schools
in
that
instance.
and
we
filed
a
motion
for
a
cross-claim
against
the
federal
government
seeking
declaratory
relief
on
that
particular
issue,
saying
we
disagree
with
your
interpretation,
the
statutory
interpretation
that
this
court
has
resolved
in
st.
martin's,
yet
on
the
constitutional
issues
of
whether
we
get
to
a
category
three
situation
here,
we
agree
with
the
federal
government.
and
that's
where
we
are
before
the
court
right
now,
with
just
the
category
three.
so
the
uniqueness
of
this
case
was
that
the
federal
government
had
to
be
a
party
of
this.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
it
was
also
sought
to--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--justice
rehnquist,
if
i
may,
they
also
did
seek
relief
against
the
federal
government,
though.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
tossed
out
of
what,
federal
court?
part
of
the
case
was
removed
from--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
wish
to
disagree.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
i
think
that
any
injunction
against
federal
taxes
would
be
handled
under
7421
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
is
having
to
do
with
state
taxes
only.
so
therefore,
because
of
the
posture
of
this
case,
i
think
that
the
only
really
relief
that
would
accord...
possible
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
matter
was
to
be
in
federal
court,
have
the
federal
government
in
there,
because
the
state
was
stuck
in
a
position
of
having
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
they
should
comply
with
what
the
federal
government
was
mandating...
excuse
me...
or
decide
to
follow
what
the
court
was
telling
them
to
do.
now,
the
court
enjoined
the
state
and
the
state
was
stuck
into
a
position
of
either...
of
doing
exactly
that.
in
fact,
there
is
evidence
in
our
case
about
how
conformity
proceedings
were
taken,
were
begun
with
respect
to
the
state.
and
so
the
situation
of
this
case,
the
federal
government
was
absolutely
essential
to
be
in
the
case.
if
i
may
get
to
some
of
the
merits
of
this,
i
believe
that
we've
handled
basically
all
of
the
issues
that
we
wish
to
raise
in
our
main
brief
and
also
our
redly
brief.
but
i
wish
to
put
the
case
in
proper
perspective,
is
that
if
we
get
to
the
merits
in
this
matter...
and
we
wish
you
do...
the
employees
are
basically
the
forgotten
people
in
this
whole
system.
there's
evidence,
there
are
discussions
completely
throughout,
about
the
employer's
rights,
the
employer's
religious
beliefs,
the
employer's
burdens,
alleged
burdens
or
whatever
they
may
be.
yet
what
it
comes
down
to,
if
the
tax
exemption
here
is
extended
to
cover
these
non-church
affiliated
religious
employers,
what
will
happen
directly
is
that
these
employees
then
are
denied
benefits.
they
cannot
get
any
unemployment
benefits.
so
quite
consistent
with
your
decision
in
u.s.
versus
lee
is
that
the
employer's
beliefs
will
be
basically
being
imposed
upon
these
employees.
and
we
have
a
situation
here
that
we
don't
have
church
affiliated
schools
involved,
we
have
independent
religious
schools.
and
these
independent
religious
schools,
one
of
the
main
reasons
they're
independent
is
they
don't
want
to
be
church
affiliated.
they
want
to
draw
from
as
broad
a
base
of
students
as
possible.
and
although
they
may
have
a
requirement
of
born-again
christians
for
their
teachers
or
whatever
the
case
may
be,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
that
every
one
of
their
employees
agrees
with
their
position
about
the
unemployment
compensation
program.
so
to
basically
deny
these
employees
the
right
to
get
unemployment
benefits
would
be
a
denial
of
their
own
beliefs,
in
fact,
if
you
will.
i
think
that
the
situation
here
is
actually
closely
analogous,
if
not
virtually
identical,
to
what
sherbert,
sherbert
versus
verner
and
the
thomas
case
discussed.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
there
where
there
was
the
state
action
prohibiting
the...
well,
the
state
action
in
denial
of
an
employee's
benefits
was
prohibited
because
of
the
employee's
lack
of
faith
or
because
of
their
own
faith.
you,
this
court,
held
that
that
was
just
not
permissible.
by
the
same
token
here,
we
have
those
same
benefits
being
denied
to
the
employees
if
the
exemption
is
extended,
and
this
time
it's
because
of
the
employer's
beliefs.
and
i
would
submit
that
it's
no
more
permissible
in
the
second
instance
than
it
was
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
well,
i
think
the
employer
has
the
right
to
put
down
however
they
wish
whatever
work
rules
they
wish.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
well,
the
employer,
if
the...
under
california
law,
the
employer
must
show
in
a
benefit
eligibility
hearing
that
there
was
an
established
work
rule
and
that
work
rule
was
knowingly
violated.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
if
the
employer
does
do
that,
then
that
employee
will
be
denied
any
kind
of
unemployment
benefits.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
well,
i
think
that
the
point
of
it
is
is
that
this
whole
system
is
a
balancing.
i
mean,
the
employer
obviously
has
certain
beliefs,
and
this
has
been
an
accommodation
all
throughout
the
entire
program,
that
the
employer
has
certain
beliefs,
has
certain
interests
that
have
been
accommodated
in
three
fashions:
it's
been
accommodated
by
extension
of
the
futa
exemption
for
all
religious
employers,
the
extension
of
the
california
exemption
to
church
related
employers,
and
finally,
that
the
employer
itself
has
the
reimbursable
method
of
contribution.
so
there
has
been
an
accommodation
of
the
religious
employer's
beliefs.
there
is
an
accommodation
of
the
religious
employee's
beliefs
as
well,
but
it's
under
a
situation
that
if
the
employer
changes
the
work
rules
after
the
fact,
like
a
thomas
or
a
sherbert
case,
the
employee
if
that
is
then
against
his
religious
beliefs
and
he
wishes
not...
that
he
just
cannot
comply
with
this,
well
then
that
employee
cannot
be
denied
benefits.
so
basically
what
we
come
to
is
really
a
balancing.
i
mean,
it's
an
attempt
to
take
in
everybody's
beliefs
as
possible,
but
still
maintain
a
comprehensive
nationwide
program,
which
is
the
public's
interest
in
this
entire
thing,
as
well,
as
the
point
of
protection
against
wage
loss
for
the
employees.
there's...
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
well,
i
believe
that
it
follows
very
directly
from
u.s.
versus
lee.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
there
is
a
narrow,
readily
identifiable
category
that
has
been
drawn.
i
think
that
if
you
don't
draw
the
line
there
with
respect
to
church
schools
or
organization
that
are
operated
by
churches,
we
have
a
problem
of
potentially
getting
into,
as
judge
stevens
said
ia
his
concurrence
in
lee,
of
evaluating
the
merits
of
each
religious
belief.
i
think
that
the
problem
that
arises
there
is
that
you
are
getting
right
involved
with
potential
entanglement.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
i
believe
it
should
be
a
rational
basis
on
this
matter,
your
honor.
the
point
of
it
is
is
that
under
the
unemployment
tax
there
has
been
classification
done
since
the
program
began.
the
carmichael
case,
the
initial
case
on
this
matter,
talked
about
classification
between
seven
and
eight
employers;
what
was
the
rational
basis
there?
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
that's
true.
but
we're
talking
about
here
trying
to
stay
out
of
evaluating
the
merits
of
each
religious
belief.
it
does
not
matter
that
that
church
that
is
exempt
opposes,
is
neutral,
or
is
unopposed
to
unemployment.
unlike
the
1402(g)
statute
in
lee,
which
talks
about
being
opposed
to
social
security
benefits,
this
is
a
very
neutral
statute
that
says...
it
doesn't
say
a
recognized
religious
sect,
like
in
1402(g).
it
talks
about
a
church.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
easily
identifiable
category--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--this
is
true.
you
cannot
accommodate--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
vesely
--well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
the
situation
is
very
analogous
to
the
lee
case
again.
what
difference
under
the
first
amendment
does
it
make
whether
you
have
a
self-employed
amish
or
a
non-self-employed
amish?
they
have
got
to
have
the
same
beliefs,
you
would
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion.
so
why
can
you
draw
a
line
there
and
not
draw
a
line
there?
i
think
there
may
be
a
question
of
whether
there's
a
wiser
line
or
a
better
line
or
whatever.
that's
not
for
this
court
to
decide.
the
same
thing
like
in
the
braunfeld
case.
you
said
that
it
didn't
have
to
decide
that
there
was
a
better
solution
than
having
a
one
day
off.
i
think
that
it's
completely
proper
here
and
i
would
ask
you
to
reverse
insofar
as
we
challenge.
thank
you.
