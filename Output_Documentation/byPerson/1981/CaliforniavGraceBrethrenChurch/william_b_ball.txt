mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
the
redwood
christian
schools
and
christian
unified
schools
of
san
diego,
this
litigation
poses
the
following
question:
may
a
pervasively
religious
school
which
in
no
wise
differs
from
the
characteristics
of
the
religious
schools
examined
by
this
court
in
lemon,
in
catholic
bishop
of
chicago,
except
for
the
matter
of
legal
connection
with
a
church,
which
is
in
no
sense
a
commercial
enterprise,
and
which
virtually
accepts
no
kind
of
direct
or
indirect
public
subsidy,
may
such
a
school
be
compelled
to
be
involved
in
a
governmental
program
of
which
excessive
entanglement
between
government
and
religion
is
absolutely
a
necessary
part?
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
am
indeed,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
thought
that
my
division
of
argument
would
necessarily
deal
with
the
entanglement
problem
as
a
precedent
to
discussing
the
jurisdictional
problem,
and
then
i
would
go
on
to
free
exercise,
and
finally,
if
time
permitted,
the
equal
protection
question.
this
act
involves
two
kinds
of
entanglements.
first
of
all,
in
the
benefit
eligibility
determination
process--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--well,
i
tell
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
get
to
the
jurisdictional
problem
through
the
entanglement
problem.
may
i
explain
that
to
the
court?
the
second
kind
of
an
entanglement
is
entanglement
relating
to
the
ordinary
administration
of
the
act
apart
from
the
benefit
eligibility
determination
process.
now,
to
come
to
that.
in
the
benefit
determination
process,
a
process
which
can
arise
at
the
very
outset
of
employment,
because
the
employee
may
already
have
picked
up
four
quarters
of
work
through
another
employer,
the
governmental
parties,
as
mr.
vesely
just
made
clear,
they
say
that
religious
ministries
can
avoid
any
entanglement
problem
simply
by
establishing
work
rules,
requiring
a
teacher
to
conform
to,
as
the
reply
brief
of
the
government
said,
the
principal's
interpretation
of
doctrinal
and
moral
matters.
at
the
trial,
the
united
states
through
its
own
expert
witnesses
attempted
then
to
provide
a
showcase
demonstration
of
how
the
work
rule
works.
but
as
the
testimony
turned
out,
it
became
crystal-clear
that
whether
the
kind
of
blank
check
a
agreement
was
used
which
the
government
had
recommended
in
its
reply
brief,
namely
the
employee
agrees
that
whatever
the
employer
says
is
doctrine
and
a
proper
code
of
conduct,
that
the
employee
agrees
to
conform
to,
or
whether
it's
a
long,
spelled-out
statement
of
faith
with
all
manner
of
rules
of
conduct
and
all
the
essential
doctrines
of
faith
spelled
out,
either
way,
as
justice...
judge
mariana
feltzer
below
said
so
accurately,
the
complexities
of
religious
faith
are
not
reducible
to
work
rules.
note
here
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
government
witnesses
were
completely
correct
in
saying,
this
is
how
a
benefit
eligibility
determination
process
has
to
work
in
any
kind
of
employment,
in
any
kind
of
institution.
but
these
witnesses
also
conclusively
demonstrated
that
when
that
process
is
applied
to
a
religious
ministry,
it
veritably
explodes
with
potential
for
entanglement.
we
had
example
after
example
where
government
expert
ernest
carter,
for
example,
was
called
to
the
stand
by
the
government
and
he
was
asked,
suppose
this
teacher
entered
into
an
understanding
with
the
school
that
he
or
she
was
to
observe
a
document
called
a
statement
of
faith,
and
that
school
discharges
her
on
the
ground
that
she
breached
the
statement
of
faith,
taught
something
contrary
to
it.
would
the
hearing
examiner
examine
what
that
agreement
was?
answer:
he
would.
well,
the
questioning
pursued,
what
if
they
disagree
about
what
the
doctrine
was?
the
employer
says,
you
breached
it,
and
the
employee
says,
no,
i
didn't.
what
does
the
hearing
examiner
do
in
that
case,
the
government
was
asked?
answer:
well,
he,
the
state,
has
to
weigh
the
evidence
from
both
parties
and
decide
in
favor
of
one
or
the
other,
weigh
the
doctrine.
government
experts
were
asked
about
cases
where
an
employee
is
discharged
for
a
decline
in
religious
fervor
relating
to
the
students,
a
very
important
element
in
a
religious
school.
the
witness
said;
i
would
have
great
difficulty
in
measuring
zeal
and
what
that
meant.
but
i
would
ask
what
harm
that
does,
what
harm
that
loss
of
zeal
does
to
the
employer.
then
the
witness
was
asked,
well,
who
would
judge
that,
the
claims
examiner?
answer:
yes.
the
implied
work
rule
also
same
very
much
into
scope
through
the
testimony
of
the
government
witnesses.
they
were
asked,
does
the
hearing
examiner
ever
get
into
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
implied
work
rule,
a
doctrine,
a
piece
of
the
statement
of
faith;
for
example,
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
answer:
yes,
and
whether
it's
enforced
or
not,
thus
taking
the
state
examiner
into
the
whole
life
of
the
institution
in
order
to
find
out
what
is
enforced,
and
with
whom,
and
when,
and
how
often,
and
to
what
degree,
into
the
faith
community
with
that
kind
of
examination.
claims
examiners
will
determine
whether
a
particular
doctrine
or
rule
of
the
religious
body
is
a
major
one
or
a
minor
one,
as
the
testimony--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--yes,
all
right.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that's
the
foundation
that
i
hope
that
i
have
laid.
and
now,
justice
white,
let
me
relate
this
to
the
question
that
you're
asking
about
district
court
jurisdiction.
california
courts
cannot
provide
a
plain,
speedy
or
efficient
remedy.
they
can't
provide
any
remedy
in
this
case.
the
entanglement
will
already
have
occurred
in
the
benefit
determination
process,
the
very
process
of
inquiry,
to
pick
up
this
court's
words
in
catholic
bishop.
and
by
the
way,
the
very--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--we
presented
this
case
in
the
district
court,
if
that's
what
you're
referring
to.
we're
saying--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--we
did
not.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
was
one.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
this
argument
was
presented
in
detail.
mr.
william
b.
ball
oh,
no,
we
presented
that
argument
in
detail,
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
white.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no,
the
district
court
agreed
that
it
did
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
b.
ball
we
alleged
that
in
our
complaint.
we
argued
it
in
the
district
court.
we
said
that
we
would
not
have
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
under
state
law.
mr.
william
b.
ball
judge
feltzer
agreed
with
that,
yes.
she
agreed
with
that
position.
she
said
you
would
not
have
a
plain,
speedy
and
adequate
remedy
under
state
law.
mr.
william
b.
ball
therefore
the
district
court
assumed
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
b.
ball
judge
o'connor--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--well,
the
reason
that
we
did
not
was
because
the
schools
in
california...
and
there
are
about
700
of
them
all
told,
of
christian
schools
of
this
kind...
were
promptly
set
upon
by
the...
by
the
california
unemployment
compensation
authorities
in
1978
and
they
were
told,
you
must
now
come
under
this
program
and
comply
with
it,
a
program
to
which
they
had
not
been
subject.
they
had
vigorous
constitutional
objections
to
this
on
free
exercise
grounds
and
on
entanglement
grounds,
which
they
very
strongly
raised.
and
the
question
became
then
one
of
whether
they
must
go
under
the
program
and
start
to
pay
under
protest
for
something
that
they
had
very
little
money
to
pay
for
to
begin
with,
use
stewardship
funds
on
a
program
that
they
believed
was
flatly
unconstitutional,
or
whether
they
could
go
into
a
federal
district
court
and
have
federal
constitutional
claims
aired
under
the
first
amendment
against
the
state
of
california
and
the
federal
government.
and
they
chose
that
route.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no,
i
don't,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
reason
that
i
don't
is
partially
the
reason
i
have
stated
here,
that
the
potential
of
entanglement
was
immediate,
that
the
benefit
determination
eligibility
process
could
be
promptly
upon
the
school.
they
could
be
thrust
into
that
almost
immediately.
there
was
another
reason
that
was
back
of
the
move
into
federal
court,
and
that
was
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
labor
had
laid
down
a
rule
that
only
those
schools
which
were
totally
religious,
in
his
view,
would
be
considered
exempt
under
the
statute,
whose
plain
wording
was
that
church
schools
were
exempt.
he
said
that
if
they
were
not
strictly
religious
then
they
would
not
be
exempt,
and
therefore
investigators
from
the
state
of
california
went
to
religious
schools
throughout
the
state
with
a
tabular
list,
trying
to
figure
out
which
of
their
functions
were
secular
and
which
were
religious.
and
this
occurred
to
these
religious
schools
we
represent
here
today
on
this
appeal,
as
well
as
the
church
schools.
so
for
all
these
reasons,
the
very
imminence--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--how
the
inquiry
with
respect--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--no.
the
inquiry
is
relevant
for
this
reason,
justice
stevens:
the...
under
secretary...
if
you're
referring
now
to
secretary
marshall's
initial
pronouncement
that
his
people
were
to
determine
what
was
strictly
religious
and
what
was
not
in
all
schools
which
claimed
to
be
religious--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--it
would
definitely
include
category
three
schools.
mr.
william
b.
ball
you
would
be,
except
for
the
fact...
that's
correct,
in
determining
whether
you
come
under
the
statute.
but
the
category
three
schools
were
especially
interested
in
all
of
the
problem
of
religious
entanglement
and
imposition
on
free
exercise
that
they
felt
the
program
embraced.
and
so,
when
i
was
referring
to
why
all
the
plaintiffs
went
into
court
to
seek
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
i
was
referring
to
all
of
them,
and
the
category
three
schools,
not
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
precisely.
mr.
william
b.
ball
we
have
that--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--absolutely
difference
with
the
federal
government.
mr.
william
b.
ball
justice
white,
page
65
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
reason
was
that
we
felt
our
constitutional
liberties
were
being
violated
at
the
very
outset.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
don't
know,
justice
o'connor,
how
the
amish
felt
in
their
case.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
indeed
have.
mr.
william
b.
ball
our
problem
is
simply
this:
we
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
mr.
lee
could
have
gone
the
administrative
route,
paid
the
tax,
and
eventually
gone
through
the
state
court
system,
and
then
come
here.
he
went
actually
through
the
federal
courts.
in
our
own
case,
we
believed
that
the
federal
courts
were
open
to
this
kind
of
case.
here
is
a
case
in
which
the
federal
courts
plainly
have
jurisdiction,
unless,
unless
the
tax
injunction
act
should
bar
that.
that
tax
injunction
act
said
if
you
have
a
plain,
speedy
and
adequate
remedy,
then
you're
not
barred.
you're
free,
you're
home
free
if
you
have...
if
you
do
not
have
a
plain,
speedy
and
adequate
remedy.
and
it's
clear
that
our
clients
did
not
have
a
plain,
speedy
and
adequate
remedy.
i
think
judge
feltzer
was
correct
also
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
was
aware
of
the
california
constitution,
which
bars
an
injunction
action,
and
the
fact
that
the
administrative
body,
under
the
california
statute
also,
an
administrative
body
cannot
declare
a
state
statute
unconstitutional.
and
here
was
the
very
thing
they
were
trying
to
do--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--i
did
not
hear.
mr.
william
b.
ball
we
could
have
sought
declaratory
relief
in
the
california
state
courts.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
this
could
have
been
done.
mr.
william
b.
ball
because
we
needed
we
needed
injunctive
relief.
mr.
william
b.
ball
because
we
needed
injunctive
relief.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
distinguish
rosewell
very,
very
greatly
from
the
case
that
we're
involved
in,
because
here
we
have
substantial
first
amendment
claims
under
the
religion
clauses.
mr.
william
b.
ball
constitutional
claims
of
a
different
sort,
mr.
justice--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--well,
i
had
thought
there
was.
i
thought
there
were
fundamental
freedoms
and
preferred
freedoms
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
ball
oh,
cantwell
versus
connecticut,
virtually
every
free
exercise
case
speaks
of
fundamental
liberties
protected
by
the
first
amendment
which
are
not
in
the
same
class
as
property
rights
or
business
rights
or
commercial
rights,
et
cetera.
mr.
william
b.
ball
not
subordinate.
i
think
these
rights
are
a
part
of
due
process,
but
they're
a
part
of
due
process
in
its
most
vital
and
sensitive
area,
namely
freedom
of
the
mind,
freedom
of
religion,
freedom
of
speech
and
press.
those
liberties
i
had
thought
the
court
had
long
since
said
were
preferred
freedoms
and
not
at
all
to
be
classified
with
property
rights.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
think
that
section
1341,
where
religious
liberty
is
actively
threatened,
yes,
i
think
that
it--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--or
speech,
indeed,
indeed.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no,
and
i
think
that
argues
in
our
behalf,
that
the
court
has
not
said
that
a
case
under
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
is
barred,
that
district
court
jurisdiction
is
barred,
where
such
liberties
are
advanced
and
where
there
are
substantial
and
bona
fide
claims,
where
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
reality
of
those
claims.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
can't
make
any
such
distinction,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
think--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--the
grading,
justice
marshall,
was
not
of
my
own.
the
grading
was
the
grading
that
the
court
has
long
since
given
to
first
amendment
freedoms.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
i
think
the...
if
we
take
cantwell
versus
connecticut--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--that
they
had
priority
over
the
action
of
the
local
commissioner
who
was
going
to
issue
a
license
for
exercising
rights
of
speech.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
the
question
is
whether
the...
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
liberty
that
is
prior
to
the
tax
injunction
act,
if
that's
the
question,
then
i
think
that
the...
our
only
position
is
that
we
don't
believe
that
a
plain,
speedy
and
adequate
remedy
under
the
tax
injunction
act
is
found
in
recourse
to
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
state
court
or
the
paying
of
taxes
while
one
awaits
disposition
in
the
state
court.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
thought
that
this
view
was
strongly
supported
by
the
majority
in
a
great
number
of
cases--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--such
as
wisconsin
versus
yoder,
ever
so
many
cases
in
which
the
court
has
declared
for
religious
liberty.
we
took
quite
literally
what
the
court
had
had
to
say
about
the
enormous
dangers
of
the
potential
for
entanglement
between
religious
activity
and
government,
and
we
think
that
here
the
record
is
very
clear
that
in
the
administrative
proceedings
which
are
inevitable
in
this
case,
in
those
administrative
proceedings,
in
the
benefit
eligibility
determination
process,
serious
constitutional
damage
would
result
to
the
religious
institution
which
we
represent.
and
this
would
be
continued
if
the
administrative
proceeding
were
continued.
you
say
you
have
an
appeal
process.
well,
you
go
through
the
appeal
process
and
these
same
inquiries,
the
whole
religious
issues
we've
been
talking
about,
the
statement
of
faith,
et
cetera,
are
recycled
in
the
administrative
level.
and
then
when
you
get
to
the
state
court
level
finally,
you
really
get
a
sort
of
posthumous
result.
the
state
court
can
simply
say,
well,
yes,
the
administrative
body
was
wrong,
the
hearing
examiner
was
wrong,
he
ought
not
to
have
gone
into
those
issues.
so
you
really
have
suffered
constitutional
damage
in
the
meantime,
only
to
be
told
at
the
end
that
it's
too
bad,
it
shouldn't
have
happened.
you've
suffered
major
needless
surgery
and
then
told,
well,
at
least
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
it.
this
constitutional
damage
goes
far
beyond
entanglement.
if
an
employee
knows
that
he
can
take
a
case
of
discharge
for
religious
reasons,
he
can
take
that
into
an
administrative
body
which
will
then
entertain
the
religious
question,
and
he
knows
then
that
they
will
do
that
and
that
he
can
get
compensated,
this
certainly
must
have
an
effect
within
the
religious
institution
itself.
and
again,
the
same
thing
applies
to
the
administrators
of
the
religious
institution,
who
know
that
their
employees
know
this.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
kind
of
entanglement,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we're
speaking
of
here
is
the
entanglement
by
a
claims
examiner
who
is
not
empowered
to
deal
with
constitutional
issues
and
who,
as
the
record
so
abundantly
shows,
will
be
taking
upon
himself
examination
into
matters
of
doctrine,
faith,
moral
conduct,
religious
fervor,
and
all
of
those
things.
that
i
think
is
quite
different
from
the
situation
that
you
pose.
mr.
william
b.
ball
then
i'm
puzzled
where
we
are,
say,
in
catholic
bishop,
where
the
court
said
that
the
very
process
of
inquiry
bring
us
into
the
area
of--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--it
is
with
respect
to
labor
relations,
and
there,
is
not
the
problem
the
same?
it
seems
to
me
the
court
in
catholic
bishop
attached
an
appendix
to
its
opinion
in
which
it
showed
that
a
certain
monsignor
o'donnell
had
been
discussing
liturgy
and
asking
questions
about
catholic
liturgy.
and
these
were,
i
thought,
shown
by
the
court
to
be
an
example
of
an
area
into
which
the
state
ought
not
be
going,
irrespective
of
whether
it
is
in
a
labor
situation
or
whatever
situation
it
might
be.
we
also
dealt
with
the
problem
of
free
exercise,
and
i'll
touch
briefly
upon
that,
only
to
say
that
we
believe
that
there
is
a
marked
contrast
here
to
lee,
to
braunfeld,
and
to
murdoch
and
fallett.
in
contrast
to
lee,
here
a
religious
activity
is
being
taxed,
and
indeed
a
prime
religious
activity,
namely
a
ministry
of
teaching.
mr.
lee
never
claimed
that
making
a
profit
by
hiring
six
or
seven
employees
to
produce
rough
lumber
for
commercial
housing
was
a
religious
activity.
in
contrast
to
braunfeld,
we
have
here
a
tax.
in
contrast
to
inferences
in
murdoch
and
fallett
that
a
preacher
is
not
entitled
to
be
free
from
taxes,
here
the
tax
is
not
on
anybody's
personal
income,
but
on
the
most
sensitive
aspect,
the
most
sensitive
aspect
of
a
school
ministry,
namely
the
employment
relationship
between
teachers
and
the
school
administration
itself.
the
government
has
put
squarely
to
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
the
proposition
that
religious
activity
may
be
taxed.
and
no
aesopian
language
about
relatively
small
amounts
or
indirect
burdens
changes
that
very
stark
reality,
and
no
compelling
state
interest
certainly
exists
for
imposing
this
tax
on
redwood
christian
schools
and
the
christian
schools
of
san
diego.
a
broad
exception
already
substantially
exists
in
the
statutes
as
they
are,
a
very,
very
broad
exception,
not
a
narrow
exception,
to
which
the
exception
of
the
church...
of
the
non-church
schools
adds
but
very,
very
slightly.
all
schools
until
1978
were
exempt,
and
therefore
one
must
inquire,
what's
the
compelling
state
interest
now
in
saying
that
these
non-church
schools
are
subject
to
the
tax.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
is
in
part
an
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
indeed,
indeed,
justice
brennan.
similar...
this
case
i
think
in
this
respect
is
very
similar
to
sherbert,
where
the
exact
same
arguments
were
made,
that
the
unemployment
compensation
program
was
threatened
if
adele
sherbert
was
let
out
from
under.
the
court
in
sherbert
said
that
the
state
must
demonstrate
that
no
alternative
will
protect
the
integrity
of
the
unemployment
compensation
program
without
infringing
first
amendment
rights.
as
to
equal
protection,
perhaps
i
should
mention
here
just
briefly
the
statements
that
have
been
made
about
employees
by
the
california
attorney
general.
first
of
all,
no
employee
is
a
party
to
this
case.
no
beliefs
here
have
been
imposed
upon
anybody's
rights
that
were
not,
for
example,
imposed
on
rights
of
employees
in
catholic
bishop.
the
churches
have
not...
the
churches
there,
in
cases
such
as
catholic
bishop,
were
not
thought
to
be
denying
their
employees'
rights.
here
the
testimony
of
mr.
enderland
at
page
89,
to
which
i
commend
the
court,
is
very,
very
clear
that
all
personnel,
whether
it's
a
bus
driver,
a
janitor,
an
accountant
or
whomever,
are
felt
to
be
and
believe
themselves
to
be
part
of
the
religious
mission
of
the
school.
we
come
then
down
finally
to
the
equal
protection
considerations,
and
feel
that
redwood
christian
schools
ought
not
to
be
treated
differently
from
the
church
schools.
there
are
three
bases
for
that
statement:
one
is
the
argument
of
the
court
below,
the
rationale
of
the
court
below,
on
the
issue
of
entanglement
itself.
we
have
raised
an
equal
protection
claim
with
strict
scrutiny
basis,
as
justice
brennan
had
mentioned.
and
then
i
refer
you
to
the
american
jewish
congress'
brief,
which
simply
says
that
disparate
treatment
of
church
versus
non-church
schools
violates
the
very
core
of
the
unitary
protection
of
the
religion
clauses.
i
think
that
too
is
a
most
significant
consideration
in
connection
with
this
case.
i
thank
the
court.
