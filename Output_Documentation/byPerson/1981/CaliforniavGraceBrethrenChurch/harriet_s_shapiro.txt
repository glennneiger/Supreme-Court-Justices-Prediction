ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
by
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
california
from
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
holding
that
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
and
its
state
counterpart
may
not
constitutionally
protect
the
employees
of
certain
religiously
oriented
schools.
last
term
this
court
decided
in
st.
martin
evangelical
lutheran
church
versus
south
dakota
that
26
u.s.c.
3309(b)
exempted
the
employees
of
schools
operated
by
a
church
or
organization
of
churches
from
coverage
under
the
federal-state
unemployment
tax
system.
the
district
court
decided
this
case
before
st.
martin
was
handed
down.
our
case
originally
involved
three
kinds
of
schools.
the
district
court
identified
them
as:
category
one
schools,
those
operated
directly
by
a
church
or
organization
of
churches...
and
category
one
schools
are
the
only
kind
that
were
involved
in
st.
martin;
category
two
schools
are
separately
incorporated,
but
controlled
or
operated
by
a
church
or
organization
of
churches,
primarily
for
religious
purposes;
category
three
schools
are
religiously
oriented
schools
that
are
independent
of
any
specific
church
or
organization
of
churches.
the
district
court
found
that
section
3309(b)
and
the
counterpart
state
statute
exempted
category
one
and
category
two
schools,
but
not
category
three
schools.
none
of
the
parties
here
contest
that
ruling,
so
there's
no
statutory
issue
before
this
court.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
filed
a
brief,
yes.
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
category
three
schools
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
exemption
from
the
act,
because
the
state
could
not
make
benefit
determinations
for
employees
of
these
statements
without
becoming
unconstitutionally
entangled
in
matters
of
religious
doctrine.
the
schools
also
make
a
free
exercise
claim
in
their
cross-appeal.
the
first
amendment
claims
of
the
category
three
schools,
that
is
those
not
associated
with
any
church,
are
the
only
issues
before
this
court
in
this
case.
this
court's
recent--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes,
it
was.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
it
was
ruled
on
and
the
district
court
rejected
it.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
is
a
cross-appeal,
yes.
this
court's
recent
decision
in
united
states
v.
lee
substantially
answers
the
first
amendment
claim.
indeed,
this
case
follows
a
fortiori
from
lee,
because
in
lee
payment
of
the
tax
was
itself
a
sin.
there's
no
such
claim
here.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
a
jurisdictional
question.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
yes,
there
is
that
question
in
the
case,
and
we've
certainly
discussed
it
in
our
brief,
and
also--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--i
hadn't
planned
to
unless--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--certainly.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
argument
basically
is--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that's
the
government's
position.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
our
argument
is
that
this
court's...
this
court's
jurisdiction
does
not
depend
on
the
district
court
having
had
jurisdiction.
we
rely
on
cases
like
mclucas
and
weinberger
versus
salfi,
in
which
this
court
said,
although
there
is
questions,
there
may
be
questions
about
the
district
court's
jurisdiction,
they
don't
have
to
reach
those
questions
because
under
section
1252
this
court
has
direct
appeal
jurisdiction
whenever
a
statute...
whenever
there's
a
constitutional
question
about
a
federal
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
even
though
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
tax
injunction
act
prohibits
the
district
court
from
enjoining
or
suspending
or
restraining.
so
i
don't
believe
that
it
applies
to
this
court.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
this
is...
we're
not
asking
that
you
grant
an
injunction.
all
we're
asking
is
that
under
section
1252
you
remove
the
cloud
that
the
district
court's
opinion
here
has
placed
on
the--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--that's
our--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well,
we're
not...
we
don't
think
that
you
should
grant
an
injunction.
but
in
mclucas--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--by
the
district
court.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well,
in
one
sense
it
will,
meaning
that
this,
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
is
not
a
precedent.
on
the
other
hand,
this
issue
has
been
raised
and
it's
going
to
be
here
on
review
of
the
state
court
decision,
as
in
st.
martin's.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
but
the
issue
has
been
raised
and
it's--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well,
except
that
in
mclucas
and
in
salfi,
both
cases
which
came
here
under
section
1252,
on
a
direct
appeal
because
a
statute
of
the
united
states
has
been
drawn
in
question
as
contrary
to
the
constitution,
this
court
said
that
there
was
substantial
question
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
salfi
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
in
injunction
under
section
405(g).
and
the
court
said,
regardless
of
that
we
have
direct
appeal
jurisdiction
under
1252
and
so
we
don't
have
to
decide
that.
in
mclucas
the
question
was
whether
the
decision
below
was
properly
decided
by
a
single
court...
single
judge
instead
of
a
three-judge
court.
and
similarly,
the
court
said,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
single-judge
district
court--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--but
it
was
also...
well,
similarly
in
weinberger
versus
salfi,
the
question
was
whether
any
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
an
injunction.
and
in
mclucas
it
was
whether
that
single
judge
had
jurisdiction
to
do
what
he
had
done.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
to
vacate
the
decision
below.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
certainly,
we
want
you
to
just
reverse
the
judgment--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--to
dismiss.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
on
the
merits,
absolutely,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
principle,
the
reason
for
the
tax
injunction
act
is
to--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--uh-hmm.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
because
that
would
not
resolve
the
cloud
that's
cast
on--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--that's
right.
but
the
question
is
not
whether
you
have
jurisdiction;
it's
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction.
and
it's
not
a
situation
in
which
there
was
any
article
iii
problem
with
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
there's
no
question
that
there's
a
case
or
controversy
here.
there's
no
question
that
we're
not
asking
you
for
an
advisory
opinion.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
you
can
certainly
do
what
you
did
in
mclucas
and
salfi
and
say,
passing
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
on
the
merits--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
because
there
there
is
a
jurisdictional
bar...
i
mean,
a
constitutional
bar
not
only
to
the
district
court
but
to
this
court,
too.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
correct
as
far
as
the
district
court's
concerned,
but
not
as
far
as
this
court's
concerned.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
my
argument
on
the
merits
basically
is
that
this
case
really
follows
from
lee
and
that
lee
stands
for
the
principle
that
once
you
enter
the
marketplace
and
hire
employees
to
provide
goods
or
services,
you
cannot
deny
those
employees
the
benefit
of
generally
applicable
statutory
protections.
there's
no
first
amendment
right
to
deny
one's
employees
the
economic
security
of
social
security
and
unemployment
insurance
coverage,
any
more
than
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
deny
them
a
safe
workplace
or
the
protection
of
child
labor
laws.
the
further
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
distinguishing
between
category
one
and
two
schools
and
category
three
schools.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
a
reasonable,
bright-line
test,
and
once
you...
if
that
bright-line
test
does
not
apply,
then
that
the
question
of
determining
when...
what
schools
are
so
religious
in
orientation
that
they
should
be
treated
as
category
two
schools
involves
very
serious
problems
of
distinguishing
between
schools
that
are
going
to
be
of
various
types.
you
really
can't
make
a
distinction
based
on
the
degree
of
the
school's
religious
orientation,
because
religious
orientation
is
not
a
readily
identifiable
characteristic
by
which
various
schools
can
be
compared.
in
sum,
we
don't
believe
there's
any
constitutional
reason
to
deny
the
employees
of
these
independent
schools
of
the
unemployment
benefits
that
congress
decided
they
should
enjoy.
congress
properly
determined
that
they
should
be
treated
the
same
as
their
counterparts
in
private
sector
schools
and
this
court
should
not
overturn
that
determination.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
only
to
state
that
the
adequacy
of
the
state
remedy
issue
is
essentially
the
argument
that
you
can't
trust
a
state
court
to
pass
on
federal
constitutional
issues,
which
we
think
is
quite
incorrect.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
state
remedy
is
certainly
entirely
adequate
as
far
as
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
schools,
are
concerned,
because
they
can
get...
i
mean,
the,
only
tax
that's
involved
in
this
case,
because
in
this
particular--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--they
decided
the
federal
constitutional
question,
because
the
state
statute
tracks
the
federal
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
certainly
were
an
appropriate
party,
but
they
were
not
a
necessary
party,
because
there's
no
federal
tax
here,
because
there
isn't
any
federal
tax
on
these
non-profit
schools.
there's
only
a
state
tax
here,
and
in
the
state
courts
you
could
get...
the
schools
could
get
a
complete
remedy
as
far
as
that
issue
is
concerned.
the
only
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
on
the
entanglement
issue.
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
state...
the
federal
witnesses
were
asked
a
lot
of
hypotheticals.
but
the
point
is
that
in
those
hypotheticals
the
question
assumed
that
there
was
not
an
appropriate
work
rule.
what
we're
talking
about
is
not
a
discharge
for
religious
reasons,
but
a
discharge
for
a
violation
of
the
work
rule,
and
the
work
rule...
you
don't
have
to
have
any
inquiry
into
the
religious
doctrine
of
the
school,
of
the
church.
what
the
work
rule
would
require
would
be
that
the
teacher
would
follow
the
directions
of
the
principal
or
whoever
was
in
charge
in
teaching,
similar
to
any
secular
schools.
the
teachers
are
supposed
to
follow
the
directions
of
those
in
charge
of
the
curriculum.
and
if
they
did
not,
then
that
would
be
misconduct.
you
don't
get
into
questions
of
what's
the
correct
doctrine
or
any
real
religious
questions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
state
requirement
that
the
work
rules
be
reasonable
means
reasonable
on
the
context
of
the
employment.
the
witness
explained
that
it
wouldn't
be
reasonable
to
have
a
work
rule
that
required,
the
example
was
a
mechanic
who
was
required
not
to
drink
off
the
job.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
believe
that,
given
a
secondary,
a
primary
or
secondary
school
with
a
strong
religious
orientation,
if
the
schools
says
our
work
rules
require
you
to
lead
a
christian
life
as
that
is
defined
by
the
principal,
and
the
teacher
accepted
the
job
on
that
understanding,
then
that
would
be
a
reasonable
work
rule.
