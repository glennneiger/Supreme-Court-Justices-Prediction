unknown
speaker
general
mcgovern,
i
suppose
that
that
test,
however,
was
an
effective
barrier
to
the
further
progress
of
those
who
failed
it.
unknown
speaker
general
mcgovern,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
may
want
to
think
about
it
over
lunch.
supposing
the
test
had
different
passing
scores
for
blacks
and
whites,
that
a
black
had
to
get
a
75
score
and
a
white
could
pass
with
65,
and
therefore
it
was
plainly
discriminatory,
but
then
when
the
whole
process
was
completed,
why,
there
was
a
fair
number
of
blacks
and
whites
hired,
as
there
are
here.
would
you
still
apply
the
bottom
line
approach?
unknown
speaker
but
the
argument
here
is
that
the
test
is
not
job-related,
and
is
discriminatory,
so
why
is
that
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
that
even
if
it
is
discriminatory
and
not
job-related,
you
nevertheless
look
at
the
bottom
line.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
they
remodeled
their
allegations
in
this
complaint
and
said,
this
is
clearly
not
a
job-related
test.
it
will
produce
the
same
kind
of
results
as
if
you
had
two
different
passing
scores.
would
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
say
about
the
blacks?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgovern,
was
that
the
result
of
an
affirmative
action
program
on
the
part
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
mean?
you
said,
yes,
it
was
the
result
of
affirmative
action.
unknown
speaker
i
remain
puzzled
by
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
as
i
understand
your
oral
recitation
of
the
connecticut
statute,
it
simply
says,
no
consideration
shall
be
given
to
race,
creed,
sex,
et
cetera,
and
yet
did
you
say,
or
am
i
mistaken
in
thinking
you
said
it,
that
this
was
to
an
extent
an
affirmative
action?
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
you
told
me,
did
you,
mr.
mcgovern,
that
the
bottom
line
was
23
percent
of
the
black
applicants--
unknown
speaker
--were
promoted,
and
only
13
percent
of
the
whites?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
reflection
of
any
preference
for
blacks
in
those
percentages?
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
mr.
mcgovern,
may
i
ask
you,
section
2(a)(2),
the
section
i
guess
we
have
involved
here
for
construction,
provides
that
it
is
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
classify
applicants
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive.
is
the
issue
here
whether
this
examination
effects
a
classification
in
violation
of
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
and
not
at
this
stage?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
say,
doesn't
it,
to
classify
applicants
in
any
way.
it
is
a
prohibition
against
classification
of
applicants,
too,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
your
answer
to
me
is
that
2
is
not
at
all
relevant
to
the
decision
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
conceded
to
justice
stevens
that
if
they
had
one
test
applicable
to
blacks
and
one
to
whites,
that
that
in
itself
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
because
there
would
be
a
racial
classification.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be.
you
still
say
that
the
passage
that
justice
brennan
read
to
you
would
not
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
to
justice
stevens
that
even
if
the
bottom
line
in
the
example
that
i
gave
you
was
the
same
as
in
this
case,
the
express
racial
classification
on
the
test
would
be
a
violation.
i
thought
you
answered
justice
stevens
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
would,
what
would
it
violate?
what
justice
brennan
read
to
you,
or
something
else?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
just
the
reverse?
if
it
were
just
the
reverse,
what
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
any
whites
complain
when
twice
as
many
negroes
were
promoted,
almost
twice
as
many
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgovern,
was
this
case
tried
on
a
disparate
impact
theory,
or
a
disparate
treatment
theory,
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
would
the
example
that
justice
stevens
gave
earlier
today
fit
better
under
the
disparate
treatment
there--
unknown
speaker
--general
mcgovern,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
defendants
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
examination
would
discriminately
exclude
black
applicants
for
promotion,
so
how
do
you...
why
is
that
different
than
the
65-75?
that
is
the
comment
from
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
you
haven't
had
the
trial
on
this
issue
yet--
unknown
speaker
--so
don't
you
have
to
assume
the
facts
favorable
to
the
other
side
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
he
do
it
on
the
assumption
that
the
test
was...
the
test
might
be
shown
to
be
an
improper
test?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
it
is
as
though
we
didn't
have
a
trial
of
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
haven't
had
a
resolution
of
the
issue
to
dispose
of
it
in
a
summary
fashion,
must
you
not
assume
that
the
plaintiffs
could
prove
what
they
allege?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
mean
to
press
this,
but
did
you
tell
me
that
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
intent,
or
merely
didn't
have
to
reach
the
question?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
where
are
you
reading
from,
24a
of
what?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
was
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
say?
what
did
it
say?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
dispute
about
that
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
hasn't
hired
a
large
number
or
any
of
the
plaintiffs
who
claim
to
be
discriminated
against.
i
suppose
the
difference
between
you
and
the
opposing
side
is
the
difference
between
the
group
on
the
one
hand
and
the
individual
on
the
other,
and
what
does
title
vii
intend
to
protect,
the
individual
or
the
group?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
will
never
convince
these
plaintiffs
of
that,
will
you?
unknown
speaker
i
say,
you
will
never
convince
these
plaintiffs
of
that,
will
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
there?
supposing
they
used
the
same
test
with
the
same
statistical
results
for
five
years
in
a
row,
so
it
was
predictable
it
would
continue
to
be
biased.
could
they
continue
to
use
the
test?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
bucci,
the
question
i
asked
your
colleague?
do
you
rely
on
that
provision
of
2(a)(2)?
unknown
speaker
no,
do
you
rely
on
it.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
the
violation
was
that
this
constituted
a
classification.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
support--
unknown
speaker
--the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
it
suggests
a
violation
of
(1),
or
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
do
also?
unknown
speaker
(1)
and
(2)?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
those
candidates
who
failed
the
examination
were
excluded
from
any
qualification
for
promotion.
those
who
passed
entered
into
the
eligibility
pool
from
which
selections,
discretionary
selections
were
made.
the
claim
of
discrimination
is
not
a
claim
of
overdiscrimination,
nor
is
it
a
claim
of
a
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination.
it
rests
upon
the
disparate
results
this
examination
had
adversely...
that
it
had
adversely
affecting
black
candidates
in
this
case.
once
they
had
passed
the
examination,
i
take
it
you
don't
claim
any
disparate
treatment.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
it
was
just
the
other
way,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
this
fact
that
such
a
larger
number
of
the
minority
candidates
were
promoted
out
of
the
successful
pool
suggest
anything
about
intent?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
were...
the
exclusion
came
at
the
initial
stages.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bucci,
i
suppose
your
clients
could
have
recovered
if
they
could
show
disparate
treatment
of
those
who
failed
the
test.
unknown
speaker
and
basically
you
did
not
proceed
further
under
that
theory--
unknown
speaker
--what
do
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
griggs,
albemarle,
and
dothard?
unknown
speaker
those
were
all
entry
level
cases,
though,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
that
was
just
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
any
strictly
title
vii
case
dealing
with
promotions
as--
--with
promotions,
no,
but
i
don't
see
the
difference
in
that
at
the
entry
level,
the
claim
is
being
made
that
people
are
not
being
given
an
equal
opportunity
to
an
employment...
equal
access
to
an
employment
opportunity.
here
we
are
claiming
that
we
are
not
being
given
equal
access
to
a
promotional
opportunity,
and
we
are
being
denied
that
by
a
facially
neutral
device
which
disproportionately
excludes
members
of
a
protected
class.
the
same
rationale
applies,
and
i
think
the
bottom
line
theory
being
advanced
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
misconceives
the
entire
disparate
impact
theory.
it
wasn't
formulated
by
this
court
just
to
guarantee
group
rights.
it
was
recognition
that
the
purpose
of
title
vii
was
to
guarantee
equal
employment
opportunities
and
also
to
eliminate
employment
devices
which
had
a...
discriminated
in
effect.
this
court
went
on
to
say
that
congress
in
achieving
that
purpose
chose
not
only
to
outlaw
overt
discrimination,
but
also
those
practices
fair
in
form
but
which
discriminated
in
effect.
congress
chose
the
method
on
how
to
achieve
its
purpose.
to
what
extent,
if
any,
in
your
view
would
the
evidence
of
160
percent,
i
think
it
was,
of
the
successful
candidates,
160
percent
of
minorities
were
promoted
over
non-minorities?
how
would
that
figure
in
your
view,
in
the
evaluation
of
the
whole
problem?
unknown
speaker
of
the
successful
ones?
unknown
speaker
you
are
really
arguing,
are
you
not,
over
a
burden
of
proof
problem?
unknown
speaker
basically.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
deal
with
the
uniform
guidelines
of
the
eeoc
where
they
say
that
if
the
total
selection
process
for
a
job
has
an
adverse
impact,
then
the
individual
component
should
be
evaluated?
unknown
speaker
does
that
indicate
that
under
the
eeoc
view,
at
least,
that
you
look
at
the
total
picture?
unknown
speaker
would
you
care
to
comment
on
the
sg's
approach
to
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
brief
specifically
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
what
eeoc
wanted
to
say,
why
wouldn't
they
have
said
it
affirmatively
instead
of
leaving
it
to
this
backhanded,
negative
inference?
unknown
speaker
i
suggest
you
are
reading
more
into
their
silence
than
is
there.
well,
the
eeoc
just
issues
guidelines
anyway.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
have
regulations
that
have
the
force
of
law.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
are
to
believe
the
footnote
in
the
sg's
brief,
it
emphasizes
administrative
and
prosecutorial
discretion
in
these
cases.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
know
what
the
united
states
government's
position
is,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
we
take
either
eeoc
or--
unknown
speaker
--which
one
shall
we
take?
unknown
speaker
the
eeoc
hasn't
filed
a
brief.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgovern,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
earlier,
once
there
is
an
adverse
impact
shown
as
to
a
particular
test
or
portion
of
the
requirements,
and
that
that
then
shifts
the
burden
to
the
employer.
would
you
like
to
comment
upon
that?
