mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
claim
of
discrimination
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
that
they
were
denied
a
promotional
opportunity
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
results
of
an
examination
that
disproportionately
excluded
black
candidates
from
promotional
eligibility.
their
claim...
the
claim
rests
upon
an
examination
that
was
held
to
determine
whether
individuals
were
qualified
for
promotion.
those
candidates
who
passed
the
examination
entered
into
a
promotional
eligibility
pool
from
which
the
appointing
authority
in
his
discretion
made
final
selections.
there
was
no
other
component
that
further
screened
the
candidates
once
entering
that
eligibility
pool.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
yes,
i
think
in
judge
meskill's
decision--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--yes,
i
do.
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
classification
adversely
affecting
the
respondents
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
that's
the
language
from
(a)(2).
judge
meskill
in
his
footnote,
his
first
footnote
to
his
opinion,
sites
both
(a)(1),
(a)(2),
and
subsection
(h),
i
think.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
the
claim--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--oh,
yes,
i--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
(1)
and
(2).
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
no.
well,
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--it
was
just
the
other
way.
i
think
there
would
be
serious
question
whether
those
candidates
who
failed
the
examination
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
final
appointments,
in
not
meeting
the
threshold
requirement
for
appointment.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
well,
i...
if
this
was
a
claim
of
intentional
discrimination,
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
the
bottom
line
numbers
can
be
used
as
evidence
of
intent,
but
i
think
maybe
it
goes
the
other
way
around
in
this
case,
when
you--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--yes,
the
exclusion
came
here
at
the
examination
stage,
and
did
not
come
in
at
the
final
selections.
so,
on
that
basis,
the
question
of
these
appointments
really
are
not
relevant
to
the
issue
at
hand.
the
issue
at
hand
is
whether
this
examination
was
job-related,
and
that
the
plaintiffs
did
establish
that
it
had
a
disproportionate
impact
upon
the
black
candidates
taking
the
examination.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
if
they
showed
intentional
disparate
treatment,
yes,
that
would
be
an
alternative
theory
to
proceed
under.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
well,
there
was
an
alternative
claim
made
to
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
disparate
treatment,
in
the
sense
that
the
examination...
that
a
passing
point
was
not
set
for
this
examination
until
after
it
was
graded,
and
then
a
passing
point
was
selected,
when
it
should
have
been
evident,
there
was
all
the
statistics
before
the
petitioners
to
realize
that
the
setting
of
this
passing
point
would
exclude
a
disproportionate
number
of
black
candidates.
in
fact,
there
was
testimony
at
the
district
court
that
a
70
was
the
initial
passing
point
that
the
statistics
of
the
exam
would
have
required,
but
it
was
lowered
to
65
so
as
to
lower
the
disparate
impact
of
the
examination
if
the
passing
point
had
been
set
at
70.
there
is
no
dispute
before
this
court,
petitioners
do
not
dispute
that
this
examination
disproportionately
excluded
black
candidates.
this
court
has
on
various
occasions
held
that
a
claimant
establishes
a
violation
of
title
vii
by
showing
that
an
employment
practice
or
device
which
is
facially
neutral
in
the
way
it
treats
various
groups
but
which
in
fact
falls
more
harshly
on
one
group
than
another,
if
that
device
cannot
be
shown
to
be
justified
by
business
necessity.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
griggs,
albemarle.
there
is...
in
teamsters
versus--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--yes,
but
i
think
the
language
also
in
washington
versus
davis,
although
not
specifically
under
title
vii,
title
vii
principles
were
applied,
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--yes,
but
the
language
and
its
dictum
from
the
court
was
that
employment
and
promotional
practices
that
had
a
disparate
impact
under
title
vii
would
give
rise
to
a
prima
facie
violation
of
title
vii.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
my
evaluation
of
the
whole
problem,
it
would
lead,
those...
it
would
lead
the...
it
should
lead
the
court
to
question
the
legitimacy
of
those
appointments.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
of
the
successful
appointments,
in
the
following
sense.
those
candidates
who
passed
the
examination,
there
were
26
black
candidates
who
passed
and
206
white
candidates.
that
made
up
the
promotional
eligibility
pool.
from
those
candidates
in
that
pool,
eleven
black
candidates
were
selected
as
opposed
to
35
white
candidates.
the
selection
rate
from
that
promotional
eligibility
pool
was
42
percent
black
candidates
as
opposed
to
17
percent
white
candidates.
now,
the
state
is
saying
that
there
was
no
affirmative
relief
given
to
these
candidates,
but
that...
such
a
gross
disparity
would
lead
to
question
why
was
there
such
a
disparity,
when
in
this
case
each
candidate
supposedly
who
passed
the
examination
had
an
equal
opportunity
for
selection.
the
appointments
came
just
one
month
prior
to
trial.
the
state
has
stated
that
that
was
because
of
an
agreement,
a
chambers
agreement.
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
what
actually
occurred
in
chambers,
but
that
is
where
i
suggest
those
numbers
come
into
play.
i
don't
think
those
numbers,
the
selection
of
those
candidates
who
passed
over
the
barrier
in
any
way
alleviates
the
claim
of
discrimination
of
those
candidates
who
couldn't
get
beyond
that
barrier.
their
claim
that
they
were
excluded
by
a
discriminatory
exam
remains
whether
the
full
number
of
black
candidates
who
passed
the
exam
were
finally
appointed.
our
claim
is
that
intentional
discrimination,
the
intent
to
discriminate
is
not
at
issue
in
the
disparate
impact
theory,
under
a
disparate
impact
theory.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
yes.
our
claim--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--basically.
our
claim
before
the
court
is
that
the
disparate
impact
theory
addresses
the
congressional
decision
to
eliminate
discriminatory
devices
that
discriminated
in
effect.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
all
right,
when
those--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--i
think
in
the
prefatory
materials
that
accompanied
the
guidelines
when
they
were
first
published
in
the
federal
register,
it
is
stated
in
there,
and
it
says,
these
should
be
viewed
as
legislative
history
of
these
guidelines,
but
it
stated
in
there,
and
it's
a
statement
by
the
eeoc,
that
the
bottom
line
approach
adopted
by
the
agency
in
the
uniform
guidelines
was
not
in
response...
it
does
not
address
the
question,
the
underlying
question
of
law.
all
it
was
was
prosecutorial
discretion
in
what
instances
to
root
out,
that
the
government
would
root
out
claims
of
discrimination.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
they
would
still
accept
claims
by
individual
claimants
who
claimed
to
have
been
disproportionately
excluded
by
a
component
of
a
selection
device.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
no.
i
know
a
brief
has
been
filed.
i
know
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission...
my
understanding
is,
they
have
not
joined
in
on
that
brief.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
yes.
that
is
what
the
brief
specifically
states,
so
i
think
if
anything
that
shows
that
the
eeoc
is
not
in
agreement
that
their
uniform
guidelines
address
the
question
of
law,
and
that
it
sets
a
standard
as
to
determining
the
question
of
law
on
the
bottom
line
approach.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
i
have
no
idea,
and
i--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--they
have
issued
guidelines.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
no,
and
this
court
on
occasion
has
stated
that
they
would
be
guided
but
they
do
not
have
the
force
of
law.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
that
was
the
reason
for
adopting
the
bottom
line
approach.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
that
is
also
stated
again
in
the
prefatory
material.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
well,
they
have
filed
an
amicus
brief.
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--the--
mr.
thomas
w.
bucci
--no,
they
haven't.
the
adoption
of
a
bottom
line
approach,
it
is
the
respondent's
claim,
would
also
be
contrary
to
two
fundamental
principles
of
title
vii,
the
first
principle
being
that
the
title
vii
was
enacted
to
prohibit
discrimination
against
individuals.
again,
congress
chose
the
means
of
prohibiting
discrimination
against
individuals.
it
selected
to
eliminate
or
decided
to
eliminate
selection
processes
that
discriminated
in
effect
unless
they
were
shown
to
be
job-related.
respondents
aren't
here
saying
that
this
examination
is
illegal
merely
because
it
had
a
disproportionate
impact.
they
have
made
the
claim
that
it
was
not
job-related,
related
to
the
job.
all
these
individuals,
these
four
respondents
in
this
case,
were
serving
for
up
to
two
years
provisionally
in
the
positions
at
question.
they
were
serving,
as
the
testimony
at
trial
indicated,
successfully
in
their
positions.
they
were
eliminated
by
this
test.
it
is
their
claim,
and
if
this
court
decides
in
favor
of
the
respondents,
that
issue
would
have
to
be
addressed
whether
the
exam
was
job-related
or
not.
also
the
claim
is
made
here
that
this
was
one
step
in
a
multiple
component
selection
process.
the
eeoc
has
issued
questions
and
answers
as
a
means
to
attempt
to
interpret
their
guidelines,
and
in
one
of
their
questions,
questions
14,
it
addresses
this
bottom
line
approach,
and
it
defines
selection
process
as
all
the
component
selection
procedures
leading
to
the
final
employment
decision.
it
is
the
claim
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
that
there
was
only
one
component
leading
to
the
final
employment
decision
or
promotional
decision
in
this
case.
that
was
the
examination.
after
the
examination,
the
commissioner
made
selections,
discretionary
selections.
there
was
no
other
component
that
further
screened
candidates
for
qualification
for
promotion.
the
claim
is
also
made
that
the
bottom
line
approach
satisfies
the
congressional
purpose
of
placing
more
black
candidates,
black
individuals
into
employment
positions,
but
again,
the
purpose
that
this
may
serve
the
purpose
of
congress
as
to
a
group,
as
to
a
classification,
runs
contrary
to
the
idea
that
title
vii
is
aimed
at
the
individual,
its
focus
is
on
the
individual,
and
that
that
focus
on
the
individual
prohibits
the
treatment
of
individuals
merely
as
components
of
a
class.
the
disparate
impact
analysis
is
focused
upon
a
device,
but
the
claim
is
that
it
discriminates
against
individuals.
disparate
impact
analysis
is
a
method
of
an
order...
it's
an
order
and
allocation
of
proof.
it's
an
evidentiary
method
on
addressing
the
order
and
allocation
of
proof
in
a
claim
that
an
employment
practice
is
discriminatory
in
effect.
to
adopt
the
position
advanced
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
this
court
would
be
sanctioning
the
use
of
selection
or
promotional
devices
that
have
disproportionate
impacts,
that
do
discriminate,
and
that
are
not
related
to
business
justification,
that
are
not
job-related.
the
touchstone...
this
court
has
said
the
touchstone
of
title
vii
is
business
necessity,
and
that
runs
throughout
the
court's
decisions,
that
if
a
selection
process
or
a
promotional
process
excludes
disproportionately
one
member...
members
of
a
protected
group,
then
that
device
has
to
be
shown
to
be
job-related,
and
that
teaching
was
from
griggs
right
down
to
dothard
versus
rawlinson.
the
court
has
addressed
the
bottom
line
approach
in
a
number
of
instances,
not
explicitly.
in
furnco,
the
court
did
say
that
the
bottom
line
numbers
were
relevant
as
to
the
question
of
intent
in
a
disparate
treatment
case,
but
in
new
york
transit
authority
versus
beazer,
dealing
with
a
disparate
impact
case,
although
the
court
found
a
weak
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
and
found
that
the
employment
practice
was
job
related,
the
court
did
not
rely
on
the
bottom
line
numbers
in
that
case
as
dismissing
or
saying
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
violation
of
title
vii.
those
statistics
showed
that
the
employment
by
the
new
york
transit
authority,
they
employed
minorities
twice
as
high
as
their
numbers
in
the
relevant
labor
market.
the
court
did
say
in
a
footnote
that
that
would
be
relevant
to
a
disparate
treatment
case
where
intent
was
required,
where
proof
of
intent
was
required.
i
think
to
adopt
the
position
advanced
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
bring
the
court
close
to
sanctioning
in
effect
a
subjective
quota
system,
in
that
as
long
as
the
bottom
line
numbers,
as
long
as
the
numbers
match
up,
irregardless
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
devices
screening
the
candidates,
then
there
would
be
no
violation
of
title
vii.
thank
you.
