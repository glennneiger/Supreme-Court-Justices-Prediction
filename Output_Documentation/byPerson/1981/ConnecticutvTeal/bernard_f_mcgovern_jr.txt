mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
title
vii
disparate
impact
case
dealing
with
an
employee
selection
process
which
as
a
whole
had
no
adverse
impact
upon
the
respondent's
protected
group,
but
which
contained
a
component
that
did.
now,
although
eight
respondents
are
listed
in
this
writ,
it
concerns
really
only
four,
and
those
are
the
four
black
respondents.
all
the
respondents
in
1978
were
welfare
eligibility
technicians
who
sought
promotion
to
the
rank
of
welfare
eligibility
supervisor.
this
meant
competition
and
a
selection
process,
the
first
step
of
which
was
the
taking
of
a
written
examination.
now,
the
examination
was
designed
and
developed
over
the
preceding
year
expressly
for
the
selection
process
by
specialists
from
the
department
of
administrative
services
personnel
division
working
with
supervisory
personnel
in
the
department
of
income
maintenance,
in
which
agency
the
respondents
worked.
the
exam
was
given
in
december,
1978,
to
329
employees
of
the
department
of
income
maintenance,
and
of
that
329,
314
were
racially
identified,
and
of
that
314,
48
were
black
and
259
were
white,
and
of
the
48
black,
26
passed
the
examination,
for
a
pass
rate
of
54.17
percent.
206
white
employees
passed
the
examination,
for
a
pass
rate
of
79.5
percent.
the
black
pass
rate
was
68
percent
of
the
white
pass
rate.
respondents
learned
that
they
had
failed
this
examination
on
or
about
march
15th,
1979,
and
as
a
result
they
could
not
continue
on
in
the
selection
process.
now,
the
process
continued
as
follows.
the
personnel
division
took
all
scores
of
all
passing
candidates
and
listed
them
on
a
promotion
list
by
order
of
rank.
each
rank
corresponded
to
a
particular
score
on
the
examination.
thus,
all
persons
with
the
highest
score
were
in
the
first
rank.
all
persons
with
the
second
highest
score
were
in
the
second
rank.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
now,
at
this
point,
the...
for
each
vacancy...
excuse
me...
in
the...
which
an
appointing
authority,
here
the
commissioner
of
income
maintenance,
had
to
fill,
he
was
entitled
to
have
certified
to
him
five
ranks.
this
is
called
the
rule
of
five.
for
additional
vacancy
which
he
had
at
this
particular
time,
he
was
entitled
to
an
additional
rank.
he
could
select
anywhere
from
among
the
ranks
which
were
certified
to
him.
therefore,
if
there
were
five
vacancies,
he
could
choose
any
five
people
from
within
the
nine
ranks
which
had
been
certified
to
him.
here
we
have
a
somewhat
unusual
situation,
and
that
is
by
the
time
which
the
promotions
were
finally
made,
there
were
46
vacancies
but
only
25
ranks
of
passing
candidates.
therefore,
the
appointing
authority
had
the
option
of
selecting
from
among
all
candidates
who
passed
the
examination,
all
25
ranks.
as
i
say,
this
is
unusual.
the
appointing
authority,
in
making
his
selections,
considered
not
only
rank
on
the
list
but
recommendation
of
superiors
and
job
evaluations.
however,
before
these
appointments
could
be
made,
respondents
sought
an
injunction
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut,
and
as
it
pertains
to
this
matter
here,
the
black
respondents
claimed
that
their
elimination
from
the
process
violated
title
vii
in
that
there
was
a
disparate
impact
upon
black
candidates
at
the
examination
stage
by
virtue
of
an
examination
which
they
allege
to
be
non-job
related.
at
this
point
in
time
there
was
a
chambers
conference,
shortly
after
the
injunction
had
been
sought.
the
petitioners
agreed
not
to
appoint
any
persons
off
the
list
until
the
case
could
be
heard
on
the
merits.
when
nearly
a
year
had
passed,
and
still
the
case
had
not
been
brought
to
trial,
and
the
exigencies
of
the
department's
business
necessitated
the
making
of
appointments,
the
petitioners
informed
the
court
that
they
intended
to
make
appointments.
the
court
agreed
not
to
proceed
on
the
temporary
injunction
motion
as
long
as
eight
positions
were
saved
for
the
eight
respondents
pending
the
outcome
of
trial.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
bottom
line
would
apply
in
that
situation,
because
there
the
device
would
be
discriminatory
on
its
face.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
that
is
a
different
case
because
in
this
situation,
it
is
not
foreseeable
to
the
appointing
authority
that
the
test
is
a
vehicle
of
discrimination.
in
fact,
quite
to
the
contrary--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--it
is
our
position
that
in
a
test
given...
well,
maybe...
i'll
withdraw
that.
first
of
all,
in
the
situation
which
you
gave,
justice,
there,
the
device
would
on
its
face
be
discriminatory.
in
another
situation,
if
the
test
were
such--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--well,
i
still
say
that
it
would
be
a
different
device,
because
there
it
doesn't
matter...
when
a
device
is
on
its
face
discriminatory,
such
as
in
manhart,
then
the
bottom
line
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
we,
however,
are
in
a
different
situation
in
this
case,
and
that
is--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
one
or
two
more
facts
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
and
that
is,
when
the
selections,
the
promotions
were
actually
made
in
this
case,
there
were
46
promotions,
and
of
those
46
promotions,
eleven
black
candidates
were
promoted
and
35
white
candidates
were
promoted.
the
black
candidate
promotion
rate
was
23
percent
of
the
original
black
applicant
pool,
while
the
white
candidate
promotion
rate
was
13.5
percent
of
the
original
white
applicant
pool.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
the
promotion
rate--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--of
black
candidates
was
23
percent
of
the
entire
black
applicant
pool.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
now--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
the
actual
promotions
were
the
result
of
an
affirmative
action
program
only
to
the
extent
as
defined
by
statute.
that
is
section
46-70
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes,
which
provides
to
the
effect
that
promotions
shall
be
made
on
the
basis
of
merit
and
qualification,
and
without
regard
to
race,
color,
creed,
and
so
forth.
the
respondents
have
suggested--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--it
was
a
result
of
state
affirmative
action
statutes
to
the
extent
that
race
is
not
considered
in
making
promotions
under
our
state
affirmative
action
laws,
and
appointing
authorities
are
sensitized
to
keep
the
selection
process
free
of
discrimination
of
all
types.
certainly,
for
the
state
in
this
particular
proceeding
to
make
appointments
at
this
juncture
of
the
examination
process
on
the
basis
of
race,
whether
to
meet
a
certain
number
of
for
any
other
reason
other
than
on
the
basis
of
merit
and
qualifications
would
be
a
violation
of
state
law,
and
i
dare
say
it
would
also
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
probably
title
vii.
we
are
not
in
a
situation
here
in
which
there
is
a
past
history
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
connecticut
as
an
employer.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
well,
if
i
confused
the
issue,
i
apologize,
justice
rehnquist.
state
affirmative
action
statutes,
connecticut
attempting
to
be
an
exemplar
in
the
area
and
requiring
agencies
to
engage...
and
equal
opportunity
is...
our
affirmative
action
statutes
are
basically
equal
opportunity
statutes.
they
require
state
agencies
to
review
their
procedures
and
policies,
and
to
make
certain
that
discrimination,
either
racially
or
religiously
or
otherwise,
does
not
enter
into
the
picture,
so
that
the
only
affirmative
action
in
the
selection
process
was
to
the
extent
that
state
officials
are,
shall
we
say,
sensitized
not
to
allow
race
to
come
into
play
in
making
a
promotion
decision.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
total
black--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
we
feel
certainly
there
isn't,
and
to
do
so
would
be
in
violation
of
state
law,
and
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
that
we
did
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
we
contend
that
any
classification
is
in
the
actual
employment
decisions.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
not
at
this
stage,
that
here
there
is
no
evidence--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--well,
we
actually
contend
that
if
there
is
any
real
prohibition
here,
it
is
under
section
1,
which
is
failure
or
refusal
to
hire
or
discharge
or
otherwise
discriminate
against
any
individual--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--it
is
our
position
that
if
there
is
discrimination,
it
is
under
section
1.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
because
there
would
be--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--which
would
end
up
ultimately
in
discrimination
with
respect
to
hiring
or
promotion.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
i
would
say
it
would
not
be
the
basis
of
a
violation
in
this
case,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
well,
perhaps
it
would
be
in
the
extent
that--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--in
that
sense,
in
that
sense
the
classification
would
be
express
and
would
be
intentionally
discriminatory.
here,
classification
is
in
the
final
selection
process
because
there
is
no
intentional
discrimination.
in
the
example
which
justice
stevens
gave,
clearly,
to
set
a
passing
point
of
75
for
blacks
and
65
for
whites
would
be
a
case
of
intentional
discrimination.
here,
if
there
is
an--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--that
would
be
discrimination
against
whites,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
it
was
tried
on
a
disparate
impact
theory,
or
perhaps
i
should
qualify
it,
because
the
respondents
as
plaintiffs
in
the
case
did
allege
disparate
treatment
with
respect
to
the
test.
however,
both
lower
courts
found
that
the
appropriate
rationale
for
this
case,
the
appropriate
model
of
proof
was
disparate
impact.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
i
say
it
would
fit
better
under
the
disparate
treatment
theory,
because
it
is
intentional,
specific
discrimination
against
the
protected
group.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
it
takes
more
than
just
an
allegation
of
discrimination
to
make
a
case
for
discrimination.
here--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--well--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--well,
in
that,
we
actually
did
have
the
trial.
the
court
actually
heard
the
case
on
the
merits,
and
then
dismissed
it
on
the
grounds
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
proved
a
prima
facie
case
in
this
instance.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
the
court
did
not
rule
on
that
question,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
it
is
as
though
we...
at
this
point
it
is
that.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
in
point
of
fact,
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
intent
to
discriminate
in
this
case,
or
no
intent
to
give
a
test
which
had
an
adverse
impact.
here,
the
test
was
not
a
standardized
device
such
as
we
had
in
griggs,
from
which
the
petitioners
could
have
concluded
before
they
gave
the
test
that
if
they
gave
it
it
would
have
the
effect
of
excluding
blacks
from
the
candidate
pool.
this
was
a
test
which
was
devised
especially
for
this
process,
and
was
being
given
for
the
first
time.
there
was
no
way
in
which
the
petitioners
from
demographic
evidence,
or,
you
know,
objective
manner
in
which
they
could
determine
what
the
effects
of
this
test
would
be
until
after
it
had
been
given
and
the
selection
process
was
well
under
way.
therefore,
the
problem
we
have
here
in
a
case
such
as
this,
which
is
free--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--no,
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
intent.
i
believe
it
would
be
on
page
24a,
where
the
court
said,
the
third
line
down--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
"#
absence
of
discriminatory
motive
was
wholly
absent.
"
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
oh,
excuse
me.
this
is
from
our
petition
for
write,
the
appendix,
page
24a,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
the...
justice
stevens
asked
whether
the
court
actually
found
that
there
was
no
intent
to
discriminate
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--as
opposed
to
just
no
evidence
on
the
matter,
and
we
cite
the
district
court's
decision
on--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--the
court
said
that
"evidence
of
discriminatory
motive
was
wholly
absent.
"
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice.
therefore,
the
problem
we
have
here
in
a
case
18
free
of
racial
animus
is,
where
do
we
measure
discrimination,
since
discrimination
is
what
title
vii
is
all
about.
do
we
measure
it
at
each
step
of
a
multi-component
process,
or
do
we
measure
it
at
the
so-called
bottom
line?
it's
the
petitioners'
position
in
a
process
such
as
this
the
focal
point
should
be
the
end
result
of
the
process.
here
we
have
a
statute.
we
are
attempting
to
peg
an
evidentiary
rule
to
a
statutory
prescription.
the
court's
focal
point
therefore
should
be
congress's
focal
point.
in
enacting
title
vii,
we
glean
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
legislative
history
that
an
overriding
concern
of
congress
in
this
instance
was
opening
opportunities
and
skilled
positions
to
blacks
and
doing
away
with
racial
job
stratification
by
eliminating
discrimination,
not
only
in
intent
but
in
effect,
and
as
this
court
in
teamsters
pointed
out,
that
it
is
to
be
expected
that
a
non-discriminatory
environment
will
result
in
a
work
force
which
mirrors
demographically
the
community.
therefore,
congress
was
interested
in
the
overall
picture.
in
addition
to
dealing
with
individual
instances
of
specific
intentional
discrimination,
congress
was
concerned
with
whether
minorities
got
skilled
jobs
in
sufficient
numbers
to
penetrate
the
ranks
of
the
skilled
work
force.
it
was
interested
in
final
employment
decisions.
our
position
is
consistent
with
all
relevant
disparate
impact
cases
of
this
court.
griggs
versus
albemarle...
excuse
me,
griggs
versus
duke
power,
albemarle
paper
company
versus
moody,
dothard
versus
rawlinson
were
all
bottom
line
cases
in
the
sense
that
in
each
of
those
cases
there
was
disparate
impact
at
the
hiring
level.
by
the
same
token,
in
espinoza
versus
farah,
the
court
found
no
title
vii
violation
because
inter
alia
the
employer
had
hired
a
large
number
of
the
plaintiff's
protected
group.
in
dothard--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--it
is
our
position,
mr.
justice,
that
title
vii
protects
individuals.
we
do
not
dispute
that
fact
with
the
other
side.
however,
here,
we
are
dealing
with
a
particular
model
of
proof,
disparate
impact,
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
such
a
situation,
disparate
impact,
non-intentional
discrimination,
that
the--
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
well,
i
hope
we
convince
the
court
in
that
respect,
but
it
is
our
position
that
in
this
model
of
proof
the
individual's
rights
are
really
tied
to
the
group's
rights
in
the
sense
that
in
a
case
such
as
this,
we
do
not
deal
with
the
individual's
particular
situation
other
than
identifying
his
protected
status,
and
so
we
do
not
know
about
his
education,
his
background,
or
any
other...
how
he
even
came
to
apply
for
the
job.
in
this
respect,
all
we
know,
that
if
an
individual
is
to
succeed
in
proving
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
that
is
contingent
upon
how
his
group
does,
and
if
his
group,
with
respect
to
the
selection
process,
does
not
succeed
as
a
group,
then
he
succeeds
in
proving
a
prima
facie
case.
however,
if
his
group
does
succeed
in
the
extent
that
there
is
no
disparate
impact
against
the
group,
then
he
fails
or
does
not
prove
a
title
vii
violation,
and
in
fact
there
is
none,
absent
intentional
discrimination.
now,
in
dothard,
this
court
described
griggs
and
albemarle
as
dealing
with
facially
neutral
employment
standards
which
disproportionately
exclude
blacks
from
employment,
and
the
court
stated
that
griggs
and
albemarle
guided
its
decision
in
that
case,
but
in
addition,
those
cases
have
elements
which
are
not
present
in
this
particular
case.
in
addition
to
containing
disparate
impact
at
both
the
selection
level
and
the
component
level,
these
cases
contain
another
element
not
present
in
this
case,
and
that
is
an
element
of
invidiousness,
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
both
griggs
and
dothard
that
title
vii
deals
with
removal
of
artificial,
unnecessary
barriers
which
operate
invidiously
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
racial
or
other
impermissible
classifications.
now,
in
griggs
and
albemarle,
the
status
quo
of
past
patterns
of
discrimination
was
frozen
by
diploma
and
test
requirements
which
had
a
certifiable,
foreseeable
effect
through
demographic
statistics
on
the
protected
groups,
and
which
also
in
the
case
of
tests
excluded
members
of
an
educationally
deprived
group,
blacks
in
north
carolina,
which
educational
deprivation
was
directly
traceable
to
race
due
to
education
in
dejure
segregated
schools,
of
which
the
court
took
notice.
in
dothard,
the
height
and
weight
requirements
were
invidious
in
the
sense
that
the
employer
knew
or
should
have
known
in
advance
from
demographic
statistics,
could
have
certified
such,
that
the
particular
component
would
have
an
adverse
impact
on
women,
and
that
component
was
related
to
gender.
here
there
is
no
invidiousness.
there
are
no
built-in
headwinds
verifiable
in
advance
from
demographic
statistics.
this
test
was
developed
for
this
process.
it
had
no
prior
usage,
no
track
record.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
i
would
say,
no,
they
could
not
continue
to
use
the
test
because
the
test
would
have
over
a
period
of
time
through
study,
demographic
statistics,
shown
that
it
would
in
effect
have
an
adverse
impact
on
a
protected
group
because
of
race.
now,
where
you
draw
the
line
is
a
matter,
i
think,
for
a
trial
court
in
a
particular
case
to
determine,
but
certainly
if
an
employer
continued
to
use
a
test
time
after
time,
and
knowing
or
was
able
to
conclude
from
the
results
of
this
test
that
it
would
have
an
adverse
impact,
in
that
situation
he
should
be
forced
to
proof
the
job-relatedness
of
the
test.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
mr.
bucci
and
i
can
agree
on
one
point,
and
that
is,
if
there
were
but
one
component
to
this
examination
process,
and
if
the
appointing
authority
were
required
to
go
down
the
list,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
as
the
examination
results
ranked
the
candidates,
then
there
would
be
a
prima
facie
case,
because
the
examination
would
in
effect
be
the
selection
process.
here,
there
was
an
examination.
candidates
were
listed
in
a
particular
order.
however,
the
appointing
authority
was
not
bound
to
go
down
the
list,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five.
he
had
other
selection
devices,
and
in
fact
employed
them
in
this
case.
so
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
a
simple
component
selection
device.
further,
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
general
proposition
endorsed
the
bottom
line
rule,
and
it
said,
viewing
the
overall
results
of
a
selection
process
ordinarily
is
a
prudent
course
to
pursue.
now,
it
did
draw
the
line
with
respect
to
an
identifiable
pass-fail
barrier
and
said
in
that
situation
a
different
result
would
obtain.
under
the
court
of
appeals
rationale,
if
all
persons
in
the
selection
process
were
allowed
to
continue
until
the
end
of
the
process,
and
then
the
exact
same
selections
were
made
as
were
made
in
this
process,
there
would
be
no
disparate
impact
case,
no
case
for
the
respondents
under
any
circumstances.
however,
furnco
and
burdine
do
not
require
the
employer
to
use
a
process
which
maximizes
consideration
of
minority
candidates,
nor
does
it
require
the
best
hiring
process
to
be
used,
and
in
point
of
fact,
the
court's
emphasis
on
a
passing
score,
some
kind
of
a
watershed
or
great
divide
is
totally
illusory,
because
in
this
situation
particularly,
where
we
have
the
rule
of
five,
there
are
many
passing
points
with
respect
to
the
selection
process,
all
the
way
up
and
down
the
list.
for
example,
if
we
had
a
situation
in
which
a
person
was
in
the
eleventh
rank,
and
there
were
but
six
vacancies,
so
that
the
appointing
authority
was...
certified
the
first
ten
ranks,
if
in
that
situation,
a
person
in
the
eleventh
rank
were,
say,
black,
and
there
were
disparate
impact
from
the
eleventh
rank
down,
would,
under
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
would
he
be
allowed
to
prove
a
prima
facie
case
with
respect
to
disparate
impact
at
the
eleventh
rank,
because
that
to
him
was
a
de
facto
passing
score
with
respect
to
those
particular
six
jobs,
and
this
could
carry
up
and
down
the
whole
process,
and
we
could
end
up
with
three
or
four
cases
on
a
particular
selection
process
involving
numerous
minority
groups.
mr.
bernard
f.
mcgovern,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
we
disagree
with
that
position.
here
we
are
in
a
case
of
establishing
a
prima
facie
case,
and
in
a
case
of
non-intentional
discrimination.
therefore,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
have
the
burden
of
making
a
prima
facie
case,
and
in
a
situation
such
as
in
this
selection
process,
there
is
no
prima
facie
case,
no
showing
in
any
sense
of
discrimination
until
such
time
as
the
plaintiff
showed
disparate
impact
with
respect
to
the
final
employment
decisions.
thank
you.
