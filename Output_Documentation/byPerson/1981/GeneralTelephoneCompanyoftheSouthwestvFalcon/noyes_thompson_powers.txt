mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
the
proper
scope
of
an
employment
discrimination
class
action.
the
petitioner,
general
telephone,
challenges
the
so-called
across
the
board
approach
to
class
certification
of
the
fifth
circuit.
under
that
approach
the
claims
of
applicants,
employees
and
former
employees
can
all
be
litigated
in
a
single
class
action
as
long
as
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
he
and
members
of
the
class
belong
to
the
same
race,
sex
or
ethnic
group
and
that
each
of
them
has
suffered
in
some
way
from
an
employer's
discrimination
against
their
group.
the
facts
of
this
case
vividly
illustrate
why
that
approach
is
wrong.
the
plaintiff,
mariano
falcon,
an
employee
of
general
telephone,
charged
that
he
was
not
promoted
to
a
management
job
because
he
was
a
mexican-american.
in
the
civil
action
that
followed,
falcon
also
sought
to
represent
a
class
of
mexican-americans
who
had
applied
for
work
at
general
telephone
but
had
not
been
hired.
without
holding
a
hearing
or
stating
any
factual
support
for
its
action,
the
trial
court
certified
falcon
as
the
sole
representative
of
this
class
of
unsuccessful
applicants.
it
did
so
despite
the
existence
of
facts
which
the
company
contends
should
have
resulted
in
a
denial
of
class
certification.
for
example,
mr.
falcon
had
never
been
an
unsuccessful
applicant
at
general
telephone.
indeed,
he
was
hired
when
he
first
applied
as
part
of
the
company's
affirmative
action
program.
moreover,
falcon's
promotion
claim
was
based
on
a
disparate
treatment
theory
of
discrimination,
while
the
hiring
claims
he
presented
for
the
class
were
based
on
disparate
impact.
and
the
evidence
which
he
introduced
in
support
of
his
own
promotion
claim
was
entirely
unrelated
to
the
hiring
claims
of
the
unsuccessful
applicant
class.
finally,
there
was
a
conflict
in
interest
of
falcon
and
the
applicant
class,
because
increasing
the
number
of
mexican-americans
employed
at
general
telephone
would
have
reduced
falcon's
own
chances
of
receiving
the
management
promotion
he
sought.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
class
certification.
in
so
doing,
it
expressly
relied
on
its
own
policy
favoring
across
the
board
class
actions
in
employment
discrimination
cases.
the
court
held
that
the
fact
that
plaintiff's
claims
and
the
class
claims
were
both
based
on
alleged
discrimination
against
mexican-americans
outweighed
the
differences
in
the
employment
practices
that
falcon
and
the
class
were
complaining
of.
the
court
did
declare
that
there
was
a
similarity
of
interests
between
falcon's
claims
and
those
of
the
class
based
upon
job
location,
job
function,
and
other
considerations.
but
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
the
jobs
that
were
included
and
those
sought
by
the
applicants
went
far
beyond
the
management
job
which
falcon
was
complaining
of
not
being
promoted
to,
and
there
is
no
indication
in
the
court's
opinion
or
in
the
record
as
to
what
other
considerations
may
have
been
similar
between
falcon's
claim
and
those
of
the
applicant
class.
general
telephone
contends
that
mr.
falcon
is
not
a
proper
representative
of
an
unsuccessful
applicant
class,
for
three
reasons.
first,
falcon's
promotion
claim
was
not
typical
of
the
hiring
claims
of
the
unsuccessful
applicant
class.
this
court
said
in
general
telephone
of
the
northwest
against
eeoc
that
typicality
limits
the
claims
of
the
class
to
those
that
are
fairly
encompassed
in
the
representative's
personal
claim.
that
certainly
was
not
true
here.
falcon's
claim
was
based
on
a
disparate
treatment
theory,
while
the
hiring
claims
were
based
on
disparate
impact.
and
the
evidence
he
introduced
in
support
of
his
own
claim
was
entirely
unrelated
to
the
claims
of
the
applicant
class.
and
so
we
say
that
there's
no
typicality
as
required
under
rule
23(a)(3).
indeed,
the
differences
between
falcon's
promotion
claim
and
the
hiring
claims
of
the
class
are
so
great
that
we
contend
that
in
this
action
there
is
not
even
the
necessary
common
issues
of
fact
or
law
required
by
rule
23(a)(2).
and
finally,
because
of
these
differences
between
the
claims
of
the
putative
class
representative
and
the
class
and
because
of
the
conflict
that
we
have
referred
to
in
the
interests
of
falcon
and
the
class,
we
contend
that
falcon
is
not
an
adequate
representative
as
required
under
rule
23(a)(4).
let
me
restate
at
this
time
what
the
petitioner
is
seeking
in
this
action
and
what
he
is
not
seeking,
what
it
is
not
seeking.
first,
general
seeking,
telephone
is
seeking
in
this
action
the
careful
application
of
the
elements
of
rule
23
that
this
court
said
was
required
in
its
decision
in
rodriguez.
we're
not
seeking
a
per
se
rule
that
under
no
circumstances
can
an
employee
ever
include
applicants
in
a
class
action
which
he
is
bringing.
if
there
is
a
common
policy
that
similarly
discriminates
against
both
employees
and
applicants,
if
there
is
sufficient
numerocity
and
if
there
is
no
conflict
in
interest,
then
it
would
be
possible
for
an
employee
to
represent
an
applicant.
but
those
elements
are
not
present
in
this
case.
and
that
is
the
second
thing
that
we
are
seeking,
which
is
the
careful
application
of
rule
23
to
this
case,
and
we
say
if
there
is
such
a
careful
application
it
will
be
clear
that
mr.
falcon--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
--your
honor,
the
government
has
supported
our
petition
and
says
that
in
their
judgment
the
fifth
circuit
across
the
board
rule
is
too
broad.
they
would
suggest
that
the
court
base
such
a
decision
on
lack
of
common
questions.
we
think
that
their
argument
is
similar
to
ours.
as
we
indicated
in
our
reply
brief,
while
we
think
there
is
a
lack
of
common
questions
here,
we
think
that
certainly
there
is
a
lack
of
typicality.
but
however
the
court
chooses
to
define
the
defect,
we
think
it
clear,
as
the
government
does,
that
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
court
below
did
not
require
the
necessary
symmetry
of
claims.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
certainly
do
not
agree
with
that.
we
see
no
need--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
--we
see
no
need
for
a
remand.
we
think
the
record
makes
clear
that
falcon
is
not
a
proper
class
representative,
never
was
a
proper
class
representative,
that
the
initial
certification
was
wrong,
and
that
the
proper
remedy
here
or
the
proper
action
for
this
court
is
as
the
court
acted
in
rodriguez,
which
is
to
reverse
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
unsuccessful
applicants
from
the
class.
finally,
we
think
it
clear
that
the
careful
application
of
rule
23
that
we
seek
in
this
case
will
not
mean
the
end
of
employment
discrimination
class
actions.
as
i
said
earlier,
when
there
is
the
proper
identity
of
interests,
where
a
policy
is
being
attacked
that
affects
various
groups
of
employees
and
at
various
locations,
rule
23
would
support
a
broad
class
action.
but
we
contend
that
there
is
not
a
basis
for
such
a
certification
in
this
case
and
that
the
court
should
direct
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court,
to
dismiss
the
unsuccessful
applicants
from
this
class
and
then
proceed
in
accordance
with
this
court's
prior
remand
for
consideration
of
falcon's
own
promotion
claim
in
the
light
of
perdine.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
think
that's
certainly
the
core
of
the
relief
that
we
are
seeking.
we
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
three
elements
of
rule
23(a)
that
we
have
cited,
each
of
them
provides
a
basis
for
reversal
in
this
action.
not
only
is
mr.
falcon
not
an
unsuccessful
applicant,
but
his
own
claim
of
being
denied
a
promotion
is
not
typical
of
the
claims
of
unsuccessful
applicants,
and
we
think
he's
not
an
adequate
class
representative.
we
have...
i
would
say
a
word
also
about
the
contention
in
amicus
brief
that
the
writ
was
improvidently
granted.
we
think
nothing
could
be
more
erroneous
than
that.
the
record
is
clear
in
this
case
that
rule
23
was
not
properly
applied.
general
telephone
tried
repeatedly
in
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
rule
23
properly
applied.
its
contentions
were
always
dismissed
with
the
contention
that
under
the
fifth
circuit's
across
the
board
approach
this
type
of
action
is
permissible
despite
the
differences
in
the
claims
of
the
class
representative
and
those
he's
seeking
to
represent.
there's
no
other
place
this
employer
can
get
what
it's
seeking
other
than
before
this
tribunal.
what
it
wants
is
an
end
to
this
litigation
of
the
claims
of
applicants,
which
has
gone
on
for
seven
years,
without
this
class
representative
having
any
personal
interest,
any
personal
experience
regarding
that
particular
element
of
the
litigation.
there's
no
question
that
at
the
time
the
court
made
its
final
certification
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
that
there
was
sufficient
numerocity.
so
this
court
must
provide
the
relief
that
we
seek
and
only
this
court
can
do
it.
the
issue
is
ripe
for
decision,
it's
not
moot,
and
again
we
simply
ask
that
rule
23
be
applied
as
it's
written.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i'll
reserve--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
--yes.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
no,
that
is
not
our
position.
but
we
do
believe
that
the
court
must
satisfy
itself,
either
through
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
by
reviewing
discovery--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
--that
there
is
more
in
support
of
the
class
allegation,
more
in
support
of
the
class
than
simply
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
your
honors,
general
telephone
is
prepared
to
defend
its
hiring
in
the
irving
division
whenever
there
is
a
proper
charge
and
a
proper
complaint.
but
it
is
our
contention
that
this
case
does
not
provide
either
a
proper
charge
or
a
proper
complaint
for
such
litigation.
and
what
we
are
seeking
is
an
end
to
this
litigation
of
hiring
claims
in
an
action
brought
by
an
individual
who
is
not
a
proper
representative
of
unsuccessful
applicants
and
whose
claim
is
not
typical
of
their
claims.
mr.
hernandez
referred
to
the
answers
to
interrogatories
which
were
before
the
district
court
in
connection
with
its
consideration
of
class
certification.
yet
it's
clear
if
one
looks
in
the
appendix
at
page
34,
where
the
answer
which
the
company
provided...
or
which
mr.
hernandez
provided
concerning
common
questions
is
set
forth,
that
he
referred
only
to
incidents
involving
promotion
claims.
he
never
alleged
anything
in
terms
of
a
common
issue
affecting
both
31
applicants
and
employees.
it's
also
clear
from
the
record
that,
while
mr.
hernandez
talks
now
about
the
associational
injury
which
mr.
falcon
may
have
suffered,
that
he
stated
during
the
trial
in
volume
one
of
the
record
at
page
355
that
the
first
time
that
mr.
falcon
experienced
discrimination
was
when
he
sought
to
pierce
the
management
veil,
as
he
referred
to
it,
and
he
sought
no
relief
from
any
personal
injury
that
he
may
have
suffered.
so
this
i
think
quite
clearly
is
an
argument
that's
been
advanced
at
this
time.
it's
also
clear
from
the
record
that
the
hiring
was
done
not
by
supervisors,
but
by
people
in
the
personnel
office.
i
would
note
particularly
that
the
thing
that
it
seems
to
the
company
is
most
needed
in
this
area
is
for
this
court
to
spell
out
more
clearly
to
the
lower
courts
and
to
litigants
what
rule
23
requires
in
an
employment
discrimination
case.
there
has
been
an
unfortunate
tendency
to
view
rodriguez
as
only
dealing
with
inadequacy
of
representation,
and
not
to
recognize
that
rule
23
has
other
elements
that
must
also
be
carefully
applied,
particularly
the
typicality
requirement.
and
it's
our
position,
and
we
believe
the
government
supports
that
position,
that
certainly
for
a
class
representative
to
represent
others
his
claim
must
advance
their
claims.
if
it
doesn't
partially
establish
the
class
claims,
then
it
cannot
be
considered
typical.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
note
that
at
page
11
of
mr.
falcon's
brief
he
urges
approval
of
a
golden
rule
of
reasonableness
in
reviewing
class
certifications.
we
submit
respectfully
that
there
is
nothing
golden
nor
reasonable
about
the
across
the
board
approach
of
the
fifth
circuit.
it
places
absent
class
members
at
risk
of
conclusive
judgments
in
cases
brought
by
persons
having
no
direct
interest
in
their
claim.
it
subjects
defendants
to
the
risks
of
successful
collateral
attacks
in
cases
where
a
defendant
is
successful.
and
it
burdens
both
the
court
and
the
defendants
with
unnecessary
litigation.
thank
you.
