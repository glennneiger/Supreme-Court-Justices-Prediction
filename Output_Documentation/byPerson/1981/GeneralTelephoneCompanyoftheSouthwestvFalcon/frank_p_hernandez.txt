mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
did
not
have
a
hearing
on
the
class
certification
issue.
i
think
in
order
to
understand
this
case
one
needs
to
put
it
in
its
proper
historical
perspective.
this
case
was
tried
before
rodriguez,
it
was
tried
before
general
telephone.
it
was
tried
right
after
eisen.
and
at
the
time,
as
the
brief
points
out,
that
class
certification
issues
were
before
the
court,
at
least
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
the
way
they
were
handled
was
that
the
litigants
representing
the
respective
parties
met
in
a
pretrial
conference,
informal
conference
with
the
court
to
discuss
potential
class
issues.
and
that
was
done.
the
court
entered
an
order
in
effect
and
advised
counsel
for
both
parties
that
they
had,
i
believe,
until
october
the
10th
of
1975
to
file
their
brief
on
the
class
action
issues.
the
plaintiff,
mr.
falcon,
filed
his
brief.
the
defendant
chose
not
to
file
a
brief
and
deprived
the
court
of
any
thinking
it
may
have
had
on
the
class
action
issue.
in
february
of
1976,
in
response
to
interrogatories
propounded
by
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
answered
them,
and
they
were
filed
with
the
court
immediately
prior
to
a
subsequent
conference
with
the
court
to
discuss
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
litigation.
subsequently
in
march
of
1976,
after
the
court
had
an
opportunity
to
view
some
of
the
factual
data
pertaining
to
the
class
and
had
an
opportunity
to
review
the
plaintiff's
brief,
the
court
entered
a
provisional
class
order
and
clearly
made
it
known
to
the
defendant
that
the
defendant
could
at
any
time
move
or
put
on
evidence,
discuss,
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
litigation.
it
was
not
until
after
the
provisional
certification
of
the
class
that
the
defendant
then
did
something
to
move
to
try
to
get
the
class
decertified.
it
wasn't
until
that
point.
and
in
that
regard
this
trial
court,
i
think,
judge
hughes
probably
handled
this
case
as
well
as
it
could
be
handled
in
light
of
the
time
and
the
historical
perspective.
she
did
not
give
us
a
class
unconditionally.
it
was
provisional.
she
told
the
defendant
that
at
any
time
they
could
put
on
evidence.
she
said
she
would
reconsider
the
class
prior
to
trial,
which
she
did.
she
would
reconsider
the
class
during
trial,
which
she
did.
she
would
reconsider
the
class
after
trial,
which
she
did.
and
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
plaintiff
never
was
satisfied
with
the
class
that
it
got,
nor
was
the
defendant.
but
the
court
was
constantly
made
aware
of
the
class
action
aspects
of
this
litigation.
now,
a
hearing
in
that
regard
i
don't
think
was
necessary,
nor
did
the
litigants
or
the
court
have
the
benefit
of
some
of
the
later
decisions
that
deal
with
class
certification
hearings
as
are
now
being
held
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
and
i
trust
in
other
districts
throughout
the
country.
but
this
is
the
way
it
was
done
at
that
time
and
it
certainly
afforded
the
court
ample
opportunity
to
be
aware
of
rule
23
and
the
various
aspects
of
rule
23
as
she
applied
it
to
this
case.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
the
requirements
of
the
rule
were
complied
with.
across
the
board
is
a
concept
that
developed
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
but
you
don't
find
the
words
"across
the
board"
anywhere
in
the
rule.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
i
think
the
court
looked
at
that
aspect
of
it,
because
we
certainly
argued
in
our
brief
for
the
across
the
board
approach,
the
concept
being
that
wherever
you
have
discrimination
against
an
employee
it
is
generally
class-wide.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
there
possibly
could
be
some
areas
where
you
might
have
a
conflict
of
interest.
i
don't
think
this
case
has
any
conflict
of
interest.
the
conflict
of
interest
was
not
really
raised.
it
became
sort
of
an
imagined
conflict
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
it
was
elevated
up
to
an
actual
conflict
in
this
court.
but
i
think
you'll
find
the
record
devoid
of
anything
that
gets
close
to
a
conflict.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
i
suppose
that
it
would
in
some
fashion
dilute
it.
but
i
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly
show
that,
although
the
company
may
tout
its
affirmative
action
program,
operation
attainment
was
a
one-shot
affair,
they
only
used
it
one
year;
that
the
affirmative
action
plan
which
had
the
management
by
objective
portions
was
never
followed
or
actually
utilized
by
the
company.
mr.
goldston
and
mr.
sumner,
the
supervisors,
testified
they
weren't
even
aware
the
affirmative
action
program
was
in
effect.
so
it
could,
but
i
think
that
the
exhibits,
the
statistical
data
in
this
case,
would
clearly
show
that
even
as
late
as
'75
and
'76
general
telephone
was
hiring
so
few
mexican-americans
that
the
potential
for
conflict
is
very,
very
rare
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
well
now,
i
didn't
say
all
discrimination
cases
are
certifiable
under
rule
23,
nor
do
i
say
that
all
title
vii
cases
are
class
actions.
and
i
think
that
the
rodriguez
versus
east
texas
really
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
facts
of
falcon.
there
are
so
many
differences
in
that
case
factually
as
compared
to
this
case.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
exactly.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
that's
correct,
and
if
you're
not
hired
you're
never
promoted.
the
problem
is,
is
that
i
suppose
this
court
used
same
interest
and
same
injuries
in
schlesinger
and
then
in
rodriguez.
it's
never
been
defined
what
the
same
interest
or
same
injury
is.
but
mr.
falcon
suffered,
as
did
the
other
mexican-americans,
because
he
was
a
member
of
a
class
of
individuals
who
were
discriminated
against,
as
the
trial
court
found.
now,
he
was
not
promoted.
people
who
are
not
hired
can
never
be
promoted.
they
all
certainly
had
common
issues
in
terms
of
financial
deprivation
in
the
form
of
back
wages,
and
they
certainly
had
another
common
interest
in
job
opportunities,
either
initially
or
in
promotional
aspects.
and
perhaps
more
important
than
anything,
the
one
thing
that
they
all
had
in
common,
other
than
being
mexican-americans,
is
that
they
were
entitled
to
work
in
a
work
environment
that's
lawful
and
free
from
discrimination.
that's
very
important,
and
that's
common.
that's
a
common
interest.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
i
don't
think
it's
enough,
but
i
think
it's
an
important
factor.
i
think
that
rule
23,
with
the
four
aspects...
if
the
trial
judge
will
go
down
those
aspects,
he
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
actually
is
a
class.
you
see,
because
where
there's
the
same
interest...
you
talk
about
same
interest,
same
injury.
same
interest,
well,
obviously
unless
you're
all
mexican-americans
you
may
not
have
the
same
interest.
obviously
you
have
to
be
an
employee
or
an
applicant
for
employment.
we're
not
representing
people
who
just
happen
to
be
walking
by
a
general
telephone
parking
lot.
obviously
you
have
some
of
the
same
job
functions.
they
had
a
promotional
scheme
here
where
they
tried
to
promote
from
within
most
of
the
time.
however,
they
did
hire
directly
in.
one
of
the
class
employees
here
actually
applied
directly
for
a
field
inspector's
job.
some
of
the
supervisors,
the
supervisors
who
did
the
evaluation
on
the
promotion
under
the
affirmative
action
program,
which
i
doubt
they
were
implementing
very
strongly,
still
were
to
interview
and
supervise
the
new
hires.
you
have
some...
you
have
a
same,
similar
job
location.
they
all
worked
in
the
north
texas
area.
general
telephone
drew
their
employees
from
the
dallas-fort
worth
metroplex.
you
have
a
lot
of
similarities,
a
lot
of
same
interests
and
a
lot
of
same
injury.
and
if
you
take
those
under
rule
23,
if
the
court
will
take
them
and
look
at
them
individually...
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
do
that
on
a
title
vii
class
action.
and
i
think
this
record
demonstrates,
for
example,
quite
clearly
that
judge
hughes
did
not
just
go
along
across
the
board.
i
think
the
record
will
demonstrate
that
there
was
discrimination
on
a
class-wide
basis
probably
against
black
american
males
and
females,
there
was
discrimination
against
females
on
a
class-wide
basis.
but
the
court
didn't
give
us
that
type
of
class.
we
limited
it
from
a
litigation
standpoint
to
the
individuals
in
terms
of
the
mexican-american
promotion
and
hiring.
now,
by
the
same
token,
i
think
that
what
i
would
like
for
the
court
to
consider
is
that
there
is
no
perfect
class,
that
there's
just
not
a
perfect
class;
that
rule
23
doesn't
require
that
you
have
a
perfect
class.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
no.
your
honor,
i
think
that
i
would
take
into
account
all
of
the
components
under
rule
23,
and
all
of
them
with
equal
effect.
i
don't
think,
for
example,
that
adequacy
of
representation
in
this
case
is
really
an
issue.
the
plaintiff
prevailed.
and
in
looking
at
the
various
aspects,
in
terms
of
numerocity
there's
no
question
but
that
numerocity
was
fulfilled.
suppose
that...
if
we're
going
to
limit,
if
this
court
is
going
to
limit
classes
of
employees
who
can
bring
an
action
to
that
employee
who
has
suffered
the
exact
same
interest
or
same
injury,
then
we're
going
to
have
a
multiplicity
of
litigation,
and
the
title
vii
litigant
will
not
be
able
to
wrong
these
remedies.
and
that's
not
the
purpose
and
the
intent
of
title
vii.
i
think
that
the
analogy
i
like
to
think
of
is
that
if
the
plaintiff
with
his
counsel
is
a
private
attorney
general
under
title
vii,
then
that
attorney
general,
private
though
he
be,
cannot
be,
should
not
be,
limited
only
to
the
very
narrow
claim
or
charge
of
discrimination
that
is
filed
by
sometimes
an
ill-informed,
uneducated
individual
who
knows
something
is
being
done
wrong
to
him
but
doesn't
know
quite
what
it
is
and
perceives
it
to
be
based
on
race,
sex,
national
origin.
and
so
how
is
that
private
attorney
general,
how
is
he
regulated?
he's
regulated
in
two
instances:
first,
he's
regulated
by
the
eeoc
and
by
the
charge.
that's
where
it
all
starts.
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
eeoc,
following
sanchez
versus
standard
brands,
sent
the
defendant
the
request
for
like
and
related
matters,
to
wit
hiring
discrimination.
the
eeoc
made
a
finding
and
a
determination
that
this
defendant,
this
company,
discriminated
as
a
class
against
applicants
in
failing
to
hire.
so
at
that
point
it
was
brought
to...
this
was
long
before
this
lawsuit
was
started.
this
private
attorney
general,
that's
his
first
regulating
factor.
the
second
place
where
he's
regulated
is
by
the
district
judge,
and
in
the
real
world
of
title
vii
plaintiffs'
attorneys,
when
that
original
petition
is
filed
you
don't
expect
to
put
out
all
of
the
factual
allegations
that
make
up
your
class.
you
do
expect
to
notify
the
court
and
the
company
that
you
are
making
class
allegations.
and
now,
under
the
procedure
at
least
in
north
texas,
you
have
90
days
to
file
your
class
certification
motion,
at
which
time
all
of
these
issues
are
taken
up,
not
on
the
merits,
but
they're
all
taken
up
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
can
in
fact
sustain
your
burden
of
proof
preliminarily
on
the
class.
and
there's
nothing
to
say
that
once
a
class
has
been
established
that
it
cannot
be
decertified,
which
has
occurred.
if
you're
going
to
follow
this,
this
area,
then
the
private
attorney
general
should
not
be
limited
to
having
the
private...
to
having
a
perfect
class.
now,
in
reality
what's
going
to
happen,
i
believe,
if
across
the
board
is
not
approved...
and
this
was
a
term
which
i
said
was
just
developed
by/the
court...
but
if
it's
eliminated,
as
general
telephone
would
ask
you
to
do,
and
this
case
is
reversed
and
not
remanded,
what's
going
to
happen
to
those
13
plaintiffs
who
have
now
been
absolutely
proven
to
have
suffered
discrimination?
what's
going
to
happen?
how
are
they
going
to
b
handled?
well,
as
a
plaintiff's
attorney,
what's
going
to
happen
is
very
simple
to
me.
you're
going
to
have
rule
23(c)(4)(b)
subclasses
being
applied
for,
and
you're
going
to
have
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
who
says,
well,
if
there
is
a
conflict
or
a
potential
conflict
of
such
a
magnitude,
then
i
move
the
court
to
designate
subclass,
i
move
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
for
the
subclass.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
from
starting
over
altogether?
well,
there's
the
time
limitation.
they
didn't
file
charges
with
the
eeoc.
the
time
limitation
i
think
would
stop
them,
i
think
these
13
anyway.
now,
i
want
to
comment
a
little
bit
on
the
question
that
related
to
the
government--
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
--i
think
that
we
could
try
to
amend
and
get
a
different
class
representative
of
that
particular
class.
i
don't
think
that's
necessary
under
this
case
and
i
do
think
that
mr.
falcon
was
an
adequate
representative
of
the
class.
you
know,
there
have
been
some
allusions
in
the
briefs
to
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
perhaps
didn't
somehow
prove
his
case
or
the
statistics
that
they
put
into
the
record
weren't
somehow
sufficient.
as
a
private
litigant
in
title
vii,
i
have
no
qualms
with
berdine,
which
says
you
have
to
prove
your
case.
i
have
no
qualms
with
mcdonnell
douglas,
which
gives
you
the
four
different
ways,
more
or
less,
how
you
can
rely
on
to
do
the
prima
facie
case.
but
it
escapes
me
how
we
forget
that
the
burden
of
proof,
although
it
is
on
the
plaintiff,
should
be
no
greater
than
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
demonstrated
that
this
company
discriminated
in
hiring,
and
the
record
and
the
statistics
are
there.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
did
remand
because
the
court
did
not
deal
with
the
years
1974
and
'75.
but
i
think
looking
at
plaintiff's
exhibit
no.
17
and
plaintiff's
exhibit
no.
20,
that
that
will
not
be
very
difficult
to
amend
or
to
expand
upon
in
terms
of
additional
findings.
i
wanted
to
comment
a
little
bit
on
the
government's
position
and
the
reason
for,
or
at
least
the
way
that
i
envision
the
reason
for
private
attorney
generals.
it
deals
with
the
congressional
intent
of
title
vii
and
the
broad-based
attack.
and
i
gather
that
the
reason
that
it's
called
an
across
the
board
attack,
at
least
in
my
mind,
is
that
because
discrimination
to
me
is
like
a
cancer,
and
you
don't
treat
cancer
very
nicely.
you
attack
cancer
and
you
attack
discrimination,
and
that's
why
they
call
it
across
the
board,
because
when
you
find
a
company
that
discriminates
against
an
employee
because
she's
a
female
or
because
he's
black
or
because
he's
a
mexican-american,
this
is...
you
attack.
and
once
you
do
find
it,
then
you
look.
generally
companies...
generally
companies
who
discriminate
in
one
area
will
discriminate
in
another.
it's
true,
you
have
to
look
and
see
whether
or
not
there's
a
central
authority,
one
personnel
office,
whether
or
not
it
might
just
be
one
supervisor.
but
all
of
that
is
done,
particularly
in
the
concept
of
title
vii
and
rule
23,
by
the
district
judge.
the
government
in
its
amicus
has
changed
its
position,
has
changed
its
position
from
where
it's
been
in
rodriguez,
changed
its
position
from
where
it's
been
in
other
cases.
i
think
it's
significant
that
it
did,
because
that's
the
public
attorney
general
and
the
public
attorney
general
we
know
is
motivated
not
always
by
the
same
motivation
that
private
attorney
generals
are,
and
that
may
all
be
well
and
proper.
there
are
some
problems
with
that,
because
public
attorney
generals
tend
to
change
quite
often.
private
attorney
generals
and
litigants
may
not.
and
i
think
that's
why
this
court,
and
i
think
that's
why
congress,
has
recognized
that
you
need
to
have
both.
now,
what
we
are
asking
is
that
this
court
do
several
things;
that
it
provide
not
only
plaintiffs,
but
it
provide
companies,
management,
with
some
clear-cut
guidelines
on
how
a
district
judge
on
a
case
by
case
basis
can
approach
the
across
the
board,
broad-based,
however
you
want
to
term
it,
challenges
to
employment
discrimination.
we
suggest
that
the
same
interests,
same
injury
requirement
from
schlesinger
or
rodriguez
be
broadly
viewed
as
title
vii
has
been
broadly
viewed
if
we
are
to
reach
the
results
envisioned
by
title
vii
in
eradicating
employment
discrimination;
and
that
that
broadness
or
the
liberal
approach
to
that
rule
be
held
in
check,
so
to
say,
by
the
district
judge
by
following
the
reasonableness
test,
by
looking
and
being
able
to
look
at
all
the
factors,
not
just
one
of
the
factors
of
rule
23,
by
being
able
to
concern
itself
with
the
various
aspects
that
go
into
making
up
whether
or
not
the
claims
are
typical,
whether
or
not
there
are
common
questions
of
law
and
fact,
whether
or
not
there's
numerocity,
whether
or
not
there's
adequate
representation,
but
that
the
district
judge
have
some
guidelines
for
doing
that.
we
suggest
that
the
local
rule
as
it's
promulgated
in
the
northern
district
under
10(b)(2)
is
a
good
model
to
follow,
because
it
requires
the
litigants
to
face
the
class
certification
issue
long
before
you
get
into
the
merits,
and
it
requires
it
specifically
by
having
you
as
a
litigant
set
forth,
in
response
to
the
seven
different
areas
that
it
requests--
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
can,
but
if
i
had
the
choice
i
would
choose
the
fifth
circuit
across
the
board
method.
mr.
frank
p.
hernandez
i'm
not
sure
that
it
can.
but
as
i
said,
i
think
that
the
across
the
board
attack
method
is
a
mere
terminology.
you
could
call
it
broad-based,
whatever
you
want
it
to.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
fifth
circuit,
affirm
or
give
some
application
to
the
across
the
board
attack
method,
and
to
allow
this
case
to
be
remanded.
it
has
been
almost
ten
years
since
mr.
falcon
filed
his
complaint
with
the
eeoc,
and
this
litigation
does
need
to
come
to
an
end.
but
more
than
that,
the
specific
instances
in
this
case
are
not
such
that
the
trial
judge
just
merely
said,
okay,
because
you're
a
mexican-american,
or
okay,
because
you're
male,
you're
entitled
to
class
action
and
i'm
going
to
find
there's
discrimination.
that
wasn't
the
case
at
all.
there
was
careful
attention
by
the
trial
judge,
without
the
benefit...
you
know,
when
we
tried
this
case
we
didn't
have
teamsters,
we
didn't
know
what
disparate
treatment
versus
or
being
analogous
to
disparate
impact
was.
we
knew
there
was
discrimination
at
general
telephone
and
we
knew
we
could
probably
prove
it.
and
when
we
got
down
to
looking
at
the
statistics
and
to
some
of
the
testimony,
it
was
true
in
certain
areas.
and
the
judge
didn't
just
surely
not
look
and
consider
the
evidence.
i
ask
this
court
to
look
at
the
statistical
evidence,
look
at
the
testimony
of
the
eeoc
investigator
and
the
plaintiff's
exhibits,
look
at
the
letters
from
the
general
services
administration
which
indicated
in
1972
that
this
company
was
lacking
in
its
employment
of
minorities,
black,
mexican-american
and
females,
particularly
in
managerial
positions.
look
at
the
fact
that
in
the
management
of
this
company
there
was
one
mexican-american
out
of
66.
look
at
the
fact
that
this
company
in
the
irvin
division,
which
the
trial
court
limited
us
to,
failed
to
hire
any
mexican-american
males
from
1972
to
1976.
and
this
was
a
company
that
was
basically
run
by
white
male
americans.
look
at
the
fact
that
this
company
used
the
so-called
operation
attainment
only
one
time.
look
at
the
fact
that
it
did
not
use
its
affirmative
action
program.
the
supervisors
testified
that
they
weren't
familiar
with
it,
even
though
it
applied
to
them.
look
at
the
fact
that
most
of
the
minority
employees
were
at
the
lower
end
of
the
job
scale
and
the
pay
level.
that
was
the
kind
of
testimony,
those
were
the
kind
of
things
that
led
this
trial
judge
to
find
that
there
was
discrimination.
the
statistical
evidence
and
the
other
testimony
led
it
to
find
that
it
complied
with
rule
23.
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to,
in
order
to
represent
one
member
in
terms
of
the
employee
or
the
applicant
as
to
the
promotional
aspects,
you
need
not
suffer
the
same
exact
injury
as
long
as
you
have
the
same
interest
and
you
suffer
some
injury.
totally
different
from
rodriguez.
in
rodriguez
there
was
no
injury.
in
rodriguez
there
was
no
motion
for
class
certification.
in
rodriguez
the
trial
court
did
not
certify
a
class;
the
appellate
court
did.
those
are
the
differences
from
rodriguez.
and
in
fact,
in
rodriguez
this
court
recognizes
that
we
are
not
unaware
that
suits
alleging
racial
or
ethnic
discrimination
are
often
by
their
very
nature
class
suits
involving
class-wide
wrongs.
that's
what
rodriguez
stands
for,
too.
common
questions
of
law
or
fact
are
typically
present.
we
too
want
all
of
the
courts
to
resolve
this
issue
in
terms
of
class-wide
and
class
action.
if
we're
not
careful
we'll
have
fragmentation
where
the
plaintiff's
attorney,
depending
on
the
district
judge,
will
either
be
litigating
a
statewide
class,
a
national
class,
or
a
committee
class,
depending
on
where
and
how
the
court
views
the
same
interests,
same
injury,
and
the
breadth
and
the
scope
of
what
a
plaintiff
can
or
cannot
prove.
we
too
want
this
court
to
apply
rule
23
carefully,
keeping
in
mind
that
rule
23
as
it
was
finally
amended
came
into
effect
finally,
i
think,
in
1966,
and
title
vii
was
passed
in
1964.
rule
23
is
not
a
civil
right
rule.
it
happens
to
be
a
rule
that's
available
to
title
vii
litigants,
and
with
good
reason.
with
that,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
remand,
affirm
the
fifth
circuit,
provide
some
guidelines
for
litigants,
for
management,
and
for
the
district
court.
thank
you.
