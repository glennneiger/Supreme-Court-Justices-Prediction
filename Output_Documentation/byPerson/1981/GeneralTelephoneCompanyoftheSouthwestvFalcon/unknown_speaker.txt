mr.
powers,
are
you
taking
the
same
position
the
government
takes?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
suggest
that
when
the
case
is
remanded
that
the
class
question
be
reexamined.
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
not
the
same
as
the
government's.
unknown
speaker
mr.
powers,
are
you
asking
for
any
more
than
the
application
of
the
traditional
rule
that
a
class
representative
has
to
be
part
of
the
class
and
possess
the
same
interests
and
suffer
the
same
injury?
unknown
speaker
i
have
one.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
a
hearing
is
always
required
at
the
district
court
level
in
order
to
apply
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
discovery
techniques.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hernandez,
do
you
contend
that
an
across
the
board
approach
is
appropriate
or
do
you
contend
that
the
rule
was...
the
requirements
of
the
rule
were
complied
with
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
applied
that
approach
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
there
are
instances
where
groups
of
employees
might
have
conflicting
interests
in
a
case
like
this?
unknown
speaker
if
you
multiply
the
number
of
hispanic
named
employees,
doesn't
that
dilute...
it
enlarges
the
pool
from
which
promotions
will
be
drawn.
doesn't
that
dilute
his
future,
as
was
suggested
in
the
briefs?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
our
holding
in
the
east
texas
motor
freight
versus
rodriguez
requires
actual
conflict?
doesn't
that
case
lay
down
a
considerably
narrower
requirement
than
you
suggest
when
you
say
that
virtually
all
discrimination
cases
are
certifiable
under
23?
unknown
speaker
but
rodriguez
does
lay
down
some
general
principles,
though,
like
the
class
representative
has
to
be
a
part
of
the
class
and
possess
the
same
interest
and
suffer
the
same
injury.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
demonstrated
very
convincingly
that
falcon
had
the
same
interests
and
suffered
the
same
injury.
he
suffered
a
failure
of
promotion
and
the
people,
some
of
the
people
he's
trying
to
represent,
suffered
a
failure
to
hire.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
sufficient,
then,
that
really
does
away
with
any
other
requirement.
if
you
say
our
commonality
is
that
we
all
want
to
work
in
a
lawful
work
environment.
do
you
think
that
would
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
sounds
as
though
you
would
reduce
it
to
one
component,
without
taking
into
consideration
the
other
factors
that
have
been
indicated
in
our
opinions.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
to
prevent
them
from
starting
over
and
drawing
from
the
people
within
the
class
that
you've
described?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
members
of
the
putative
class
have
no
standing
to
amend
the
showing,
enlarge
the
showing,
and
maybe
get
a
different
class
representative?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
position
of
the
fifth
circuit,
it's
across
the
board
approach,
can
be
reconciled
with
the
western
electric
case
in
the
fourth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
can
understand
that.
