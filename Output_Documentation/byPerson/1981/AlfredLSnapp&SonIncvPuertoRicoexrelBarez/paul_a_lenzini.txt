mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
this
litigation
is
only
one
chapter
in
an
attempt
by
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
to
place
unemployed
farm
workers
in
jobs
in
the
east
coast
apple
harvest.
the
1978
conduct
complained
of
is
not
an
isolated
occurrence,
but
part
of
a
continuing
effort
by
certain
apple
growers
to
discourage
referral
of
puerto
rican
labor.
this
is
a
claim
for
equitable
relief,
but
much
of
the
equity
of
the
claim
is
not
before
the
court.
money
damages
were
not
sought.
because
the
complaint
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
standing,
the
factual
allegations
are
to
be
taken
as
true
for
present
purposes.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
if
this
were
being
advanced
on
behalf
of
two
puerto
rican
workers?
i
think
that
parens
patriae
standing
would
not
exist,
if
that
were
all.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
the
line
is
hard
to
draw,
your
honor,
but
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a
history
of
three
years
of
attempts
by
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
to
place
workers,
and
we
have
had
in
1978
particularly
a
complete
frustration
of
a
very
large
government
effort
to
place
workers
in
the
east
coast
apple
harvest.
if
a
single
worker,
or
if
two
workers
were
fired
by
the
growers,
i
do
not
see
that
we
would
have
parens
patriae
standing,
because
i
believe
that
it
is
different
from--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--the
harm
must
be
serious.
it
is
very
hard
to
draw
the
line,
your
honor.
the
harm
must
be
serious,
and
this
is
serious
harm
particularly
because
it
is
addressed
at
a
group
boycott
in
effect.
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
the
gravamen
of
that
complaint
was
that
the
20
railroads
had
conspired
to
prefer
other
ports
to
georgia
ports,
and
therefore
it
was
an
attempt,
justice
douglas
held,
to
discriminate
against
the
state
of
georgia,
and
thereby
to
place
her
citizens
in
an
inferior
position
vis-a-vis
other
states.
this
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
this
is
what
we
allege.
we
allege
the--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--puerto
rican
discrimination.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
puerto
rican
discrimination,
your
honor,
because
puerto
ricans
represent
the
only
large
labor
pool
that
can
compete
with
the
alien
workers.
puerto
rican
workers
represent
a
threat
to
the
use
of
alien
workers.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
exactly.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
that's
correct.
it
is
our
position
that
there--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
parens
patriae
actions,
while
it
has
not
been
really
articulated,
there
has
been
a
reluctance
to
permit
the
sovereign
to
unleash
his
majesty
upon
private
litigants,
and
therefore
as
in
in
re
debs,
before
the
government
is
going
to
be
permitted
to
come
in
against
private
parties,
there
must
be
a
public
wrong,
and
that
the
sovereign
may
not
vindicate
the
rights
of
individuals,
a
small
number
of
individuals.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
no,
i
don't
think
it's
article
iii
except
in
the
larger
sense
of
justiciability.
i
believe
that
if
a...
if
95
percent
of
the
people
of
the
state
were
affected,
and
the
state
went
in
to
seek
an
advisory
opinion,
there
would
be
no
article
iii
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
original
jurisdiction?
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
the
state
of
north
carolina
sues
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think
there
may
be
jurisdiction
parens
patriae.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
no,
i
think,
as
i
say,
this
is
not
associational
standing.
i
believe
that
this
is
not
like
the
sierra
club.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
puerto
rico
is
injured
like
georgia
was
injured
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case.
it
is
injured
because
the
treatment
of
the
workers
has
been
a
systematic
attempt--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--of
some
of
its
citizens.
of
those
citizens--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--the
question
is
how
much
of
the
effort--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--how
much
of
the
effort
was
frustrated.
this
has
been
an
effort
by
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
an
important
effort,
to
send
workers
to
the
east
coast
apple
harvest--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
is
a
part
of
the
federal
employment
service
system.
a
major
facet
of
that
system
is
that
a
strong
congressional
preference
has
been
established
for
domestic
workers
over
foreign
workers.
as
part
of
the
federal
employment
service
system--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--indeed
it
is.
the
puerto
rico
department
of
labor
is
a
part
of
the
federal
employment
service
system.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
yes,
it
is.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
am
sorry.
the
federal
employment
service
system
is
involved
in
the
case
because
the
workers'
job
orders
were
sent
through
the
federal
employment
service
system
to
puerto
rico.
they
are
not
a
party.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
they
are
not
a
party
to
the
case.
the
department
of
labor
is
not
a
party
to
the
case.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
nor
is
it
here
in
any
other
way.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
they
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
which
they
have
said
that
this
case
by
the
commonwealth
does
not
impair
or
in
any
way
contradict
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
they
agree
with
us
that
the
administrative
remedies
are
ineffective,
and
they
do
not
lend
themselves
to
be
used
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
systemic
violation,
an
industry-wide
violation
by
the
apple
growers.
i
think
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
been
given
no
statutory
authorization
to
bring
actions
against
the
growers.
i
believe
that
the
united
states,
however,
is
in
no
worse
position
than
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
because
i
think
under
28
usc
section
1345,
that
the
attorney
general
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
would
have
the
right
if
he
chose
to
do
so
to
go
in
to
enforce
an
action
against
large-scale
violations--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--he
has
not
done
so.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
the
commonwealth
as
a
unit--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--justice
marshal,
that
is--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--we
have
2.7
million
people
in
puerto
rico--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--as
of
the
1970
census.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
if
you
stop
it
at
that,
justice
marshal,
it
is
a
small
proportion.
it
is--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--i
don't
want
to
sue
everybody.
i
want
to
not
take
that
narrow,
that
inhospitable
a
view
of
the
complaint,
because
we
have
more
people
injured
than
those
who
are
directly
harmed
by
the
growers'
actions.
we
have
the
people
who
didn't
come
in
1979,
who
didn't
come
in
1980.
we
have
the
frustration
by
the
commonwealth
of
its
effort.
it
is
being
denied
the
right
to
send
workers
in
to
a
major
crop
in
the
united
states.
that
crop,
the
east
coast
apple
harvest,
every
year
utilizes
5,000
to
6,000
aliens.
now,
5,000
to
6,000
jobs
every
year
from
here
on
out...
when
you
have
an
unemployment
rate--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--in
this
case
we--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--seven...
6,000
aliens,
visas
are
usually
granted
for
around
6,000
aliens.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
aliens.
puerto
ricans
are--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--no,
we--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--but
we
have
a
right
to
a
preference
over
the
aliens,
and
if
we
show
up
at
the
orchards,
we
are
entitled
to
a
preference.
now,
they
have
said
that
the
puerto
ricans,
they
have
tried
to
make
them
appear
to
be
unavailable.
we
are
available,
and
if
we
are
available,
we
are
entitled
to
a
preference
over
the
alien
workers.
the
congress
has
provided
a
very
strong
preference
for
the
domestic
worker.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
the
government
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
brancamp
case,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
it
is...
a
petition
for
writ
of
cert
was
filed
in
brancamp,
and
it
is
pending,
but
i
have--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--that's
the
second
circuit
case,
but
in
this
case,
i
have
filed
a
supplemental
brief
in
which
i
appended
the
amicus
brief
of
the
department
of
labor
in
the
brancamp
case.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
the
amicus
brief
was
filed
in
the
second
circuit
at
the
request
of
the
panel.
the
day
after
the
argument
was
held,
they
requested
the
solicitor
general
to
file
an
expression...
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
the
department
of
labor,
as
it
turned
out,
filed
a
brief
for
the
secretary,
because
his
was
the
primary
responsibility
for
carrying
out
the
statute,
and
in
that
brief,
the
question
had
been
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
employment
system...
the
employment
service
complaint
system,
which
is
this
administrative
relief
provision
available
to
the
workers,
whether
or
not
that
was
an
adequate
remedy
for
these
workers,
and
the
answer
given
there
was
no,
it
is
not,
it
does
not
address
the
type
of
widespread,
industry-wide,
systematic
discrimination
which
was
the
subject
of
this
case.
and
more
than
that,
the
ultimate
relief
that
could
be
granted
would
be
the
denial
of
the
right
of
the
growers
to
bring
in
aliens
in
the
following
year,
and
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
use
the
employment
service
system.
that
is
of
no
use
to
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
because
we
want
to
send
workers
up
here
to
pick
apples.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
april,
1981.
it
is
entitled...
it's
a
brown
brief
entitled
response
of
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
to
supplemental
brief
in
support
of
petition
for
writ
of
cert.--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--there
is
no
federal
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
strong
congressional
preference
articulated
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
that
preference
is
brought
forward
by
the
federal
employment
service
system
whenever
growers
choose
to
try
and
get
alien
workers
brought
in.
the
privilege
to
bring
in
alien
workers
is
a
privilege
granted
to
few
industries
in
this
country.
you
can
name
them
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand.
the
apple
growers
is
one
industry
that
may
use
alien
workers.
now,
detroit
may
like
to
do
that,
and
the
steel
mills
may
like
to
do
that,
but
they
cannot
do
that.
the
apple
growers
can
do
that,
and
when
the
apple
growers
go
out
for
this
privilege,
they
take
on
certain
duties
and
responsibilities,
and
one
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
is
to
make
available
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis
jobs
to
u.s.
citizens
who
show
up,
and
i
believe
that
that
would
not
be
the
situation
in
your
hypothetical.
there
is
a
federal
right
here.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
there
is
a
right
not
to
be
denied
equal
treatment,
except
by
due
process
standard.
gonzalez
versus
freeman
is
a
case
that
comes
to
mind.
but
in
the
situation
you...
your
hypothetical,
you...
i
don't
think
that
georgia
is--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--i
don't
see
the
right...
i
don't
see
the
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
see
the
right
here.
i
don't
see
the
right
there.
if
all
you
are
saying
is
that--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--the
federal
right.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
well,
we
certainly
have
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act,
and
we
have
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
and
we
have
the
right...
we
have
federal
enforcement
of
these,
and
we
have
private
enforcement
of
these.
we
usually
have
individual
complaints.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
an
entire
government
program
which
is
being
defeated.
the
puerto
rican
government
is
being
defeated
in
its
attempt
to
send
workers
into
the
east
coast
apple
orchards.
they
are
being
frustrated
almost
completely.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
that
is
the
statutory
right.
a
strong
congressional
preference
has
been
established.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
quite
that
simple,
because
i
don't
know
of
any
federal
statute
which
has
ever
established
a
parens
patriae
right,
because
a
parens
patriae
right
has
always
depended
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
it
is
a
very
elusive
concept,
and
the
concept
is,
when
the
injury--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
--no,
i
think
it
is
the
same
as
the
states'.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
suppose
there
are
some
others.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
well,
those
are
the
cases
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
yes,
i
think
so,
because
i
think
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
the
question
was
one
of
discrimination
of
a
particular
sector
of
the
country.
georgia
was
being
put
in
an
inferior
position
by
railroads
who
were
preferring
the
ports
of
other
nearby
states,
and
i
think
that
was
not
a
concept.
it's
the
discriminatory
element
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
that
distinguishes
it,
i
think,
from
the
atchison
case,
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
because
we
have
here
an
attempt
by
the
growers
to
prevent
the
puerto
ricans
from
being
a
threat
to
their
use
of
alien
labor.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think
that's
right.
we
have
23
percent
rural
unemployment,
which
means
we
have
a
body
of
workers
who
are
unemployed,
rural
laborers,
and
who
are
available
as
a
pool
to
supply,
to
be
a
labor
supply
for
agricultural
pursuits.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
not.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
there's
nothing
special
about
puerto
rico
in
this
respect.
public
law
87
was
enacted
by
the
commonwealth
legislature
in
1962,
and
it
set
forth
special
obligations
on
the
part
of
workers
who
would
hire
for
off-island
use
puerto
rican
laborers.
in
the
mid-seventies,
1975,
1976,
the
u.s.
department
of
labor
held
that
if
the
puerto
ricans
were
to
insist
upon
these
extra
conditions
that
were
not
available,
not
required
under
the
federal
employment
service
system,
then
they
would
be
held
legally
unavailable
in
terms
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
that
is
to
say,
even
though
they
were
in
fact
available
to
work
in
these
orchards,
they
would
not
be
held
to
be
legally
available
because
they
were
asking
for
more
burdensome
conditions.
when
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
flecha,
fiecha
versus
quiros,
the
commonwealth
legislature
said,
we
will
have
to
act,
because
public
law
87,
designed
to
help
the
workers,
is
being
used
to
bar
the
workers,
and
so,
they
said,
if
jobs
come
through
the
federal
employment
service
system,
the
secretary
of
labor
is
permitted,
given
the
discretion
to
exempt
these
workers...
these
growers,
pardon
me,
from
the
additional
conditions
of
public
law
87.
in
due
course,
then
2,000
puerto
rican
workers
were
recruited
to
work
in
the
1970
apple
harvest,
but
immediately
four
associations
of
apple
growers
went
into
court
in
the
western
district
of
virginia.
they
had
initially
complained
that
they
were
subject
to
the
terms
of
public
law
87,
and
they
now
complained
that
they
were
exempted
from
the
provisions
of
public
law
87.
on
the
strength
of
their
assurances
to
the
district
court
that
giving
an
injunction
permitting
all
of
these
immigrant
visas...
non-immigrant
visas
would
not
in
any
way
harm
the
domestic
workers.
on
the
strength
of
that,
they
obtained
an
injunction
permitting
them
to
bring
in
1,000
additional
alien
laborers.
thereafter,
there
were
too
many
workers
in
the
orchards,
and
the
massive
firings
and
the
failure
to
hire
at
the
orchard
gates
ensued
in
the
virginia
orchards.
mr.
bacas,
opposing
counsel,
says
that
the
individuals
can
sue
on
their
own.
there
is
no
need
for
this
parens
patriae
action.
he
has
a
problem,
however,
because
we
have
people
who
were
left
at
the
gates
in
puerto
rico.
when
the
growers
were
not
hiring
these
people
in
the
orchards,
the
u.s.
secretary
of
labor
advised
secretary
quiros
that
he
could
not
send
up
any
more,
he
should
not
send
up
any
more,
and
so
these
workers
who
were
ready
to
go
up
to
virginia
were
cancelled.
where
is
the
remedy?
is
it
breach
of
contract
for
those
workers
who
were
left
at
the
airport?
is
it
breach
of
contract
for
those
workers
who
didn't
come
up
in
1979?
they
have
no
remedy.
there
is
no
remedy
under
the
employment
service
complaint
system.
that
is
futile.
there
is
no
remedy
in
puerto
rico,
we
believe,
that
is
a
secure
remedy.
in
maryland
versus
louisiana,
just
last
term,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
this
first
use
tax,
7
cents
per
mcf
on
gas
coming
into
louisiana,
would
that
give
rise
to
a
parens
patriae
claim
on
the
part
of
eight
states
who
sued
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
the
court
held
that
there
was
parens
patriae
jurisdiction.
it
involved
many
people;
no
doubt.
it
was
7
cents
per
mcf.
but
there
were
claim...
there
were
forums
available
in
louisiana.
there
was
a
tax
refund
suit
filed
by
a
natural
gas
carrier,
but
the
court
in
a
footnote
held
that
because
there
was
no
injunction,
preliminary
injunction
available
prior
to
decision
on
the
merits,
that
was
an
imperfect
forum.
well,
we
have
a
number
of
imperfect
fora
in
this
situation.
the
administrative
forum
is
certainly
imperfect.
suits
by
individuals
either
in
puerto
rico
or
in
virginia,
a
very
imperfect
form,
given
the
nature
of
these
immigrant
laborers.
we
have
the
class
action
suit
up
in
new
york
involving
new
york
growers.
that
comes
fairly
close
to
getting
the
kind
of
thing,
the
kind
of
relief
that
we
are
seeking,
except
that
there
is
no
class
action
suit
against
the
virginia
growers.
we
finally
have
the
statement
of
the
department
of
labor
that
the
parens
patriae
action
of
the
commonwealth
does
not
infringe
any
u.s.
interest.
it
is
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
department
of
labor,
because
it
is
consistent
with
the
strong
policy
preference.
if
that
policy
preference
is
to
be
established,
we
can
send
workers
up
to
virginia.
if
it
is
not,
we
cannot,
and
this
suit,
we
submit,
is
the
only
effective
vehicle
to
establish
in
the
western
district
of
virginia
the
strong
preference
of
congress
that
u.s.
workers
be
preferred
over
aliens.
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
along
with
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
on
these
issues
should
be
affirmed.
