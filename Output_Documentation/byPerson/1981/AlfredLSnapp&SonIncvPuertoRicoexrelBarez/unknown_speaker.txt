unknown
speaker
could
they
have
brought
a
class
action
here?
unknown
speaker
could
the
individuals
or
respondents
here
have
brought
a
class
action
on
the
same
general
allegations?
unknown
speaker
but
could
they
have
brought
an
action?
unknown
speaker
the
employees,
i
am
speaking
of.
i
misspoke
myself
when
i
said
respondents.
the
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
lost
all
those
cases
so
far.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
all
certified.
unknown
speaker
no.
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bacas,
i
gather,
at
least
by
statute,
puerto
rico
has
put
a
special
burden
on
the
puerto
rican
commissioner
of
labor
to
protect
the
rights
of
puerto
ricans
participating
in
this
program,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
a
rather
broad
responsibility,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
do
you
think
that
the
commonwealth...
i
guess
it
is
commonwealth
law,
not
state,
isn't
it?
that
commonwealth
law
has
any
role
to
play
in
deciding
a
parens
patriae
issue?
unknown
speaker
none.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
is
parens
patriae--
unknown
speaker
--well,
are
you
suggesting
that
parens
patriae
is
a
jurisdictional
article
iii
problem?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
cases
and
controversies,
but
it
is
between...
controversies
between
the
person
bringing
the
suit
and
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
we
have
something
to
say
about
that
in
the
case
five
or
six
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
the
name
eludes
me
at
the
moment,
but
it
is
discussed
in
some
of
the
briefs.
all
i
can
remember
about
it
is,
it
was
written
by
mr.
justice
marshal.
unknown
speaker
yes.
that's
the
one.
unknown
speaker
it
was
on
antitrust,
wasn't
it?
wasn't
it
on
antitrust,
and
parens
patriae
was
just
a
little
narrow
slice
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
concerns
me,
and
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question,
if
a
state,
and
let's
for
this
purpose
treat
puerto
rico
as
a
state,
and
it's
a
sovereign
state,
and
adopts
a
rather,
as
it
has
here,
a
system
for
implementing
the
federal
statute,
why
can't
we
defer
to
the
state's
view
of
its
policy
and
sovereignty
interest
instead
of
substituting
our
own?
are
you
going
to
suggest
we
can't
because
there
is
an
article
iii
limitation?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
that?
i
still
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
are
you
saying
that
an
individual
puerto
rican
who
got
drawn
into
this
and
came
up
here
and
sat
idle
and
didn't
get
a
job
or
some
other
comparable
complaint
could
sue
that
particular
apple
grower?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
we
have
had
original
cases
in
which
we
have
thought
that
we
ought
not
allow
a
state
suing
another
state
to
invoke
our
original
jurisdiction
if
all
it
is
doing
is
fronting
for
some
private
interest
in
the
state,
but
that
is
a
matter
of
protecting
our
original
jurisdiction,
but
i
still
wonder
why
in
the
district
courts
a
state
isn't,
in
the
context
of
this
kind
of
case,
with
this
kind
of
implementation,
why
a
sovereign
state
ought
not
be
welcome
in
a
federal
district
court
to
represent
the
citizens--
unknown
speaker
--to
protect
their
federal
rights
as
the
federal
government
has
set
them
up.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
those
reasons
are...
those
considerations
don't
apply
to
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
we
allow
private
organizations
to
bring
lawsuits
in
the
federal
district
courts
on
behalf
of
their
members,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
can't
we
allow
states,
sovereign
states
to
bring
proceedings
on
behalf
of
their
citizens
in
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
the
puerto
rican
legislature
thought
there
were
a
number
of
puerto
rican
citizens
who
had
interests
under
this
federal
setup
to
be
protected
and
imposed
the
burden
on
the
commissioner
of
labor--
unknown
speaker
--to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
protect
them.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
this
lawsuit
by
puerto
rico
was
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
these
rights
of
puerto
rican
citizens
consistently
with
the
regulations
and
federal
rules
of
the
department
of
labor,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can't
all
that
operate
and
yet
allow
puerto
rico
to
maintain
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
all
we
have
got
in
the
way
of
remedy
involved
here
is
injunctive
relief,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
only
injunctive
relief,
isn't
it,
that--
unknown
speaker
--not
damages,
however.
unknown
speaker
no.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
this
would
just
be
an
application
of
the
ordinary
rule
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies?
unknown
speaker
or
not?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
different
from
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
they
are
suing
on
behalf
of
citizens
nevertheless.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
is
all
there
is
to
it,
then
that
would
be
on
the
assumption
that
even
if
there
is
standing
in
the
sense
of
case
or
controversy,
that
federal
courts
should
refrain
from
exercising
its
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that,
but
assume
we
didn't
agree
with
you
about
case
or
controversy,
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
case
or
controversy.
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
still
another
reason
why
it
should
not
be
exercised--
unknown
speaker
--that
there
is
an
administrative
remedy
that
should
be
resorted
to
first.
unknown
speaker
certainly
it
is
not
the
ordinary
exhaustion
doctrine
that
you
are
talking
about,
i
take
it,
since
that
is
ordinarily
raised
by
the
state
or
saying
you
should
have
tried
your
state
remedies
first.
here,
the
state
is
saying,
in
effect,
you
don't
have
to
use
your
administrative
remedies.
i
mean,
in
fact,
we
will
sue
on
your
behalf.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
federal
regulations--
unknown
speaker
--and
not
puerto
rican
regulations.
unknown
speaker
for
purposes
of
this
case,
counsel,
are
the
workers
in
puerto
rico
or
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
any
different
from
the
state
of
michigan
with
respect
to
all
the
automobile
workers
of
detroit,
for
example?
is
there
anything
special
about
the
commonwealth
status
that
gives
it
a
special
parens
patriae
status?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words--
unknown
speaker
--so
for
these
purposes,
this
case
would
have
to
be
decided,
would
you
say,
on
the
same
basis
as
though
the
state
of
michigan
brought
a
suit
against
a
lot
of
people
on
behalf
of
the
automobile
workers?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
bacas.
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
if
we
have
to
deny,
and
it
is
not
to
be
denied
on
jurisdictional
grounds
and
article
iii
grounds,
then
where
does
the
federal
courts'
authority
to
deny
a
sovereign
state
parens
patriae
come
from?
if
it
is
not
article
iii,
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
there
isn't
any
other
place.
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
article
iii,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
did
you
read
hawaii
against
standard
oil,
which
of
course
originated
in
the
district
court,
as
turning
on
article
iii
considerations?
unknown
speaker
but
all
of
the
parens
patriae
cases
were
cited.
the
original
jurisdiction
parens
patriae
cases
were
cited--
unknown
speaker
--weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
so
why
couldn't
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
the
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
they
couldn't,
but
what
was
the
reason?
do
you...
could
you
get
it
out
of
the
opinion?
unknown
speaker
so
is
that
just
an
application
of
an
ancient
rule
that
the
real
party
in
interest
should
sue,
or
was
it
an
article
iii
decision
like
you
suggested
earlier?
unknown
speaker
then
you
do
have
a
fall-back
position.
the
fall-back
position
is
that
even
if
the
case
or
controversy
limitation
doesn't
bar
you,
bar
this
action,
that
even
more
ancient
principles,
namely,
that
the
party
in
interest,
that
puerto
rico
has
no
real
interest
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bacas,
in
analyzing
this,
should
we
consider
some
of
the
same
factors
that
the
court
considered
in
determining
standing
for
a
private
organization
such
as
in
havens
realty
corp.
opinion
decided
this
term?
unknown
speaker
in
applying
those,
then,
how
is
puerto
rico
different
from
the
organization
home
which
was
found
to
have
standing
in
havens
realty?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
in
the
sierra
club
case
or
something
that
it
was
recognized
that
even
if
an
association
has
10,000
members,
if
it
is
alleged
that
at
least
two
or
three
of
them
use
that
area
along
the
river
for
camping,
that
that
is
enough
to
give
the
association
standing,
or
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
to
affect
all
the
members,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would,
yes.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
were
two
residents
of
puerto
rico
who
were
advancing
this
claim,
instead
of--
unknown
speaker
--how
about
20?
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
you
must
have
some
theory.
what
proportion
of
the
total
market
or
the
total
population,
or
where...
there
must
be
a
line
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
alleged?
unknown
speaker
and
so
in
a
sense
you
are
saying
it
is
an
ethnic
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
affect
everybody
in
puerto
rico.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
it
another
way,
and
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
interests
of
puerto
rico
transcends
the
interest
of
the
individual
worker.
unknown
speaker
and
hence
supports
your
parens
patriae
theory.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
would
you
say...
if
there
were
just
two
involved,
just
two
workers,
you
really
should
come
out
with
the
same
result,
that
it
is
really
a
discrimination
against
puerto
ricans.
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
article
iii
standing--
unknown
speaker
--what
would
happen
if
a
complaint
were
filed
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
against
the
state
of
new
york
alleging
that
new
york
growers
wouldn't
hire
north
carolina
fruit
pickers?
would
we
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
would
we
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
no,
any
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
no,
sues
the
apple
growers
of
new
york,
saying
that
they
won't
hire
citizens
of
north
carolina
to
pick
apples.
unknown
speaker
on
what...
on
parens
patriae?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
that
opens
up
the
whole
can
of
worms,
doesn't
it?
every
state
can
sue
on
anything
on
parens
patriae.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
puerto
rico
qua
puerto
rico
injured
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
of
some
of
its
citizens.
unknown
speaker
the
number
being
unimportant.
unknown
speaker
i
come
back
to
the
chief
justice.
would
it
apply
to
two?
unknown
speaker
but
the
state...
does
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
have
the
right
to
make
american
citizens
hire
their
people?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
federal
employment
service
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
the
federal
employment
services
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
not
up
here--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
is
not
here
in
any
other
way.
unknown
speaker
do
i
assume
they
are
not
interested?
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
not
done
so.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
see
what
interest
that
is
of
ours.
i
mean,
i
am
just--
--suppose--
--i
still
just
don't
see
how
the
commonwealth
as
a
unit
is
injured,
because--
unknown
speaker
--of
700,
a
maximum
of
700
of
their
citizens
are
unemployed.
unknown
speaker
they've
got
more
than
that
unemployed
in
san
juan
alone.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
and
so
700
is
a
very
small
proportion.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
what
i
thought
you
were.
you
want
to
sue
everybody
now,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
less
than
1,000
involved
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
the
7,000.
unknown
speaker
puerto
ricans?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
represent
all
of
them,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
are
only
talking
about
puerto
ricans.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lenzini,
did
you
say
that
the
government
had
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
or--
unknown
speaker
--which
isn't
before
us
now.
unknown
speaker
stay
close
to
the
microphone,
counsel.
is
that
the
second
circuit
case?
unknown
speaker
was
that
filed
in
this
court
or
in
the
second
circuit?
unknown
speaker
the
amicus
brief
you
are
referring
to
of
the
united
states
you
filed
as
an
appendix
to
your
brief
filed
here.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
in
the
response...
that
was
at
the
petition
of
cert
stage.
unknown
speaker
that
was
filed
on
may
8th,
1981?
unknown
speaker
right.
thank
you.
let
me
try
another
hypothetical
to
see
if
i
can
understand.
suppose
an
action
is
brought
by
the
state
of
georgia
against
all
the
hotel
and
restaurant
owners
in
new
york
city,
where
probably
there
is
the
largest
concentration
of
that
group
in
the
country.
assume
it,
anyway.
and
they
allege
that
the
minority
unemployment
in
the
state
of
georgia
is
25,000
people,
and
that
they
want
jobs
in
new
york
in
hotels
and
restaurants,
and
that
those
jobs
are
now
held
two-thirds
by
puerto
ricans,
and
that
there
is
a
plan
and
scheme
to
hire
puerto
ricans
for
these
positions
in
new
york,
and
that
therefore
the
unemployed
of
georgia
are
being
denied
something.
now,
laying
aside
all
the
merits,
does
georgia
have
parens
patriae
standing
to
bring
that
suit?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
federal
right
in
any
collective
minority
group
not
to
be
discriminated
against
on
the...
at
least
on
the
allegations
that
i
have
hypothesized
to
you?
unknown
speaker
georgia's
economy
is
being
injured
by
reason
of
having
to
have
all
these
alleged
thousands
of
people
on
relief
and
unemployed,
and
so
the
state
of
georgia
and
its
taxpayers
have
certainly,
if
the
allegations
can
be
established,
but
the
allegations
certainly
make
an
injury
to
the
state
of
florida
as
such,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
federal
right.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
there
is
a...
you
are
saying
to
us
then
there
is
no
federal
right
on
minorities
as
a
group
not
to
have
some
other
category
of
minorities
also
preferred
over
them?
unknown
speaker
and
the
statutory
right
is
to
be
hired
before
foreign
workers?
unknown
speaker
but
all
you
are
saying
is
that
these
people
who
are
discriminated
against
according
to
you
have
a
right
of
action,
but
that
doesn't
give
the
right
of
action
to
puerto
rico.
if
so,
the
statute
should
have
said
so.
is
it
that
simple?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
has
a
parens
patriae
right
superior
to
the
states'?
unknown
speaker
the
same
as
the
states',
and
the
only
case
you
can
get
is
the
georgia
case.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
one.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
one.
unknown
speaker
what
about--
--you
suppose?
you
didn't
look
long?
if
there
were
others,
wouldn't
you
have
cited
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
supreme
court
cases
aren't
really
very
consistent,
are
they?
do
you
see
any
way
of
reconciling
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
with
oklahoma
versus
santa
fe
railroad?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
threat...
do
you
think
the
action
of
the
growers
was
directed
against
puerto
ricans
in
a
different
sense
than
it
would
have
been
directed
against
people
from
maryland
or
people
from
michigan,
or
were
they
just
anxious
to
use
alien
labor
and
exclude
whatever
citizens
they
might
want
to,
or
might
have
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
michigan
had
exactly
that
same
situation,
23
percent
unemployed.
would
they
have
any
lesser
a
claim
than
puerto
rico
did?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
nothing
peculiar
about
the
puerto
rican
labor
force
or
the
status
of
puerto
ricans
that
gives
you
any
special
standing.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
is
still
a
pretty
large
labor
force,
isn't
it?
you
don't
have
787
in
your
law
firm,
i
am
sure.
unknown
speaker
i
said,
it
is
still
a
fairly
large
working
force,
over
700.
it
is
a
lot
larger
than
any
law
firm
in
the
country.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we--
unknown
speaker
--are
we
dealing
in
percentages?
you
take
the
case
of
north
dakota
against
minnesota.
that
didn't
involve
many
people
either
who
were
flooded
out.
