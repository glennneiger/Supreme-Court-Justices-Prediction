mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
has
standing
as
parens
patriae
to
sue
32
individual
apple
growers
from
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
for
allegedly
breaching
the
employment
contracts
and
allegedly
violating
the
federal
statutory
and
regulatory
rights
of
a
small
number
of
puerto
rican
workers
during
the
1978
apple
harvest.
i
am
going
to
get
into
these
points
in
more
detail
later,
but
we
think
there
are
three
major
reasons
why
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
lacks
parens
patriae
standing
in
this
case.
first,
the
injuries
alleged
did
not
affect
the
general
population
of
puerto
rico
in
a
substantial
way.
secondly,
we
believe
that
puerto
rico
in
affect
is
attempting
to
litigate
the
personal
claims
of
a
small
group
of
its
citizens.
thirdly,
we
believe
that
the
puerto
rican
workers
allegedly
aggrieved
have
adequate
remedies
and
have
clearly
demonstrated
their
ability
to
litigate
the
issues
themselves.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
have
they
brought
a
class
action?
not
in
this
case,
your
honor,
unless
you
count
the
action
in
puerto
rico.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
that
have
been
brought.
not
all
the
cases
involve
all
of
the
defendants
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
the
individuals
are
not
respondents
in
this
case.
it
is
the
commonwealth--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--could
they
have
brought?
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
your
honor,
there
have
been
cases
where
they
have
brought
purported
class
actions,
and
we
have
opposed
those...
the
class
certification
in
those
cases.
we
just
do
not
believe
that
those
cases
satisfy
the
rule
23
requirements
for
class
action.
it
is
that
simple.
for
the
very
same
reason--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--no,
sir,
we
have
not
lost
or
won
those
cases.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
they
are
all
pending.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
the
court
in
new
york
in
the
case
of
rios
v.
donovan,
which
was
originally
styled
rios
v.
marshall,
has
not
yet
made
a
ruling
on
whether
to
certify
the
class.
we
have
opposed
it,
and
we
strenuously
oppose
it
because
we
don't
think
it
is
class
action
material.
basically,
you
have
a
number
of
individual
workers
who
have
claims
against
individual
growers.
a
particular
puerto
rican
worker,
if
he
accepted
a
job
offer,
accepted
the
job
offer
of
one
grower.
if
he
was
discriminated
against,
he
was
discriminated
against
by
that
one
grower.
he
does
not
have
a
grievance
against
any
other
growers,
and
yet
what
they
have
attempted
to
do
in
this
case
and
what
they
have
attempted,
the
individual
puerto
ricans
have
attempted
to
do
in
these
purported
class
actions
is
to
lump
together
into
one
case
something
which
really
shouldn't
be
brought
as
one
case.
the
facts
in
the
case,
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
since
the
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
pursuant
to
rule
12(b),
we
must
accept
as
true
all
the
material
allegations
of
fact
in
the
complaint.
the
facts
are
basically
these.
there
are
32
virginia
apple
growers
who
were
sued
in
the
district
court
and
are
petitioners
in
this
court.
each
virginia
grower
in
the
spring
of
1978...
i
think
the
complaint
says
april
28th,
1978...
filed
individual
applications
to
the
united
states
department
of
labor
for
permission
to
bring
in
temporary
foreign
workers
under
the
h2
program.
the
h2
program
was
created
pursuant
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
and
it
provides
for
the
admission
of
temporary
foreign
workers
into
this
country
when
not
enough
qualified
u.s.
workers
are
available.
there
are
very
detailed
procedures
set
out
in
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department
of
labor
at
20
cfr
part
655.
the
h2
program
is
administered
jointly
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
the
u.s.
department
of
labor.
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
and
its
department
of
labor
plays
only
a
very
peripheral
role
in
the
administration
of
this
program,
and
its
role
is
severely
circumscribed
by
these
regulations.
for
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
greater
detail
in
the
brief,
the
clearance
order
or
the
job
offers
of
these
individual
virginia
growers,
even
though
they
were
filed
as
early
as
april
of
1978,
were
not
sent
to
puerto
rico
until
early
august
of
1978.
this
was
less
than
two
weeks
before
the
growers
were
due
to
be
certified
as
to
their
needs
to
bring
in
temporary
foreign
workers.
this...
the
resulting
last
minute
recruitment
by
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
allegedly
produced
names
of
enough
puerto
rican
workers
to
fill
all
the
jobs
of
all
the
32
virginia
growers,
a
total
of
787
jobs
for
all
32
growers.
however,
only...
when
the
apple
harvest
arrived,
only
420
of
the
puerto
ricans
actually
arrived
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
the
remainder
never
left
the
commonwealth.
the
united
states
department
of
labor
in
effect
ordered
the
cancellation
of
the
remaining
flights,
allegedly
because
"certain
growers
had
refused
to
employ
individuals
referred
by
puerto
rico.
"
of
the
420
puerto
ricans
who
did
arrive
at
the
orchards,
allegedly
fewer
than
30
had
employment
three
weeks
later.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
they
do
under
public
law
87.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
would
say
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
absolutely
none,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
the
concept
of
standing
is
a
federal
constitutional
concept--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--even
parens
patriae
standing.
well,
they...
in
fact,
they
rely
on
it
in
a
very
limited
sense.
they
say
that,
well,
the
department
of
labor
of
puerto
rico
is
the
proper
party
to
bring
this
parens
patriae
action
as
a
result
of
public
law
87
if
parens
patriae
action
is
permitted
to
be
brought,
so
that
law
is--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
where
do
i
get
that?
article
iii
limits
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
to
cases
and
controversies,
and
the
courts
have
generally,
as
i
will
discuss
in
greater
detail
in
my
argument--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
which
case
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
are
you
talking
about
hawaii,
your
honor?
are
you
talking
about
hawaii
v.
standard
oil?
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
the
hawaii
v.
standard
oil,
there
was
extensive
discussion
of
parens
patriae
standing
in
that
case,
which
was,
incidentally,
brought
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
an
original
action
in
this
court.
the...
i
think
justice
marshal...
he
may
correct
me,
but
i
believe
he
made
the
reference
that
parens
patriae...
the
case
did
not
ultimately
turn
on
the
question
of
parens
patriae
standing,
but
there
was
an
extensive
discussion--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--yes.
it
did,
but
the
ultimate
issue
in
hawaii
really
turned
on
the
question
of
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
whether
a
state
was
entitled
to
bring,
in
effect,
a
treble
damage
claim
under
the
antitrust
law,
and
the
court
held
it
did
not.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
article
iii
limits
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
to
cases
and
controversies,
and
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
case
and
controversy
between
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
and
these
individual
growers.
there
might
be
a
case
and
controversy
between
the
individual
puerto
rican
workers
who
allegedly
were...
applied
for
these
jobs
and
allegedly
were
discriminated
against,
or
were
denied
employment.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
certainly.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
we
have
never
contested
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
hear
a
claim
of
a
particular
worker,
whether
it
be
puerto
rican
or
from
some
other
state,
to
sue
a
particular
grower.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
your
honor,
i--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--your
honor,
you
are
right
that
most
of
the
cases,
especially
the
cases
in
this
court,
have
involved
the
question
of
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
and
i
think
the
court
has,
justifiably
so,
been
very
protective
of
that,
to
limit
cases
which
truly
merit
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--they
don't,
your
honor,
but
this
court
has
never
so
limited
the...
in
stating
the
test
for
parens
patriae
standing,
this
court
has
never
so
discriminated
between
those
cases
of
parens
patriae
brought
as
original
cases
in
this
court
and
those
cases
brought
in
the
district
court.
for
example,
justice
marshal's
discussion
in
hawaii
v.
standard
oil,
that
was
not
an
original...
case
of
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honor.
one
is,
the
state
is
presuming
here
to
speak
for
all
of
its
workers.
we
don't
know
whether
all
of
those
workers
actually
even
have
complaints.
that
is
one
reason
why
we
limit
cases
generally
to
those
people
who
are
actually
aggrieved.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
the
legislature
of
puerto
rico
did
enact
public
law
87,
and
that
public
law
87
has
been
in
effect
overruled
by
the
first
circuit
in
the
case
of
hernandez
flecha
v.
quiros.
in
effect,
they
said,
it
is
not
the
function
or
the
role
of
the
legislature
of
puerto
rico
to
dictate
the
requirements
of
the
job
orders
that
are
sent
through
this
federal
system.
that
is
up
to
the
united
states
department
of
labor
to
determine
those
requirements,
which
it
does
under
those
extensive
regulations
that
i
have
referred
to
at--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--the
suit
does
purport
to
do
that,
your
honor.
however,
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
procedure
set
forth
in
the
regulations
which
the
commonwealth
is
purporting
to
enforce.
these
regulations
specify
a
procedure.
when
an
employee
has
a
complaint
against
a
grower,
he
can
file
a
grievance
with
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
under
those
regulations,
a
worker
from
puerto
rico
who
works
in
virginia
and
goes
back
to
puerto
rico
believing
he
has
a
grievance
can
file
a
complaint
with
the
department
of
labor
of
puerto
rico.
under
the
regulations,
the
department
of
labor
of
puerto
rico
must
refer
that
complaint
to
the
state
agency
in
the
state
where
the
work
was
performed.
that
state
agency
investigates,
gives
a
hearing
if
necessary,
and
there
is
even
a
right
of
appeal.
if
the
worker...
the
determination
is
not
to
the
worker's
liking,
he
can
appeal
that
to
the
regional
administrator,
where
the
same
process
works
again,
even
the
provision
of
a
full
hearing.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
in
effect,
you
would
be
having
a
complete
duplication
of
litigation.
the
mere
fact
that
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
is
bringing
this
lawsuit
has
certainly
not
stopped
the
workers
from
bringing
their
own
lawsuits
or
even
filing
their
own
complaints
with
the
employment
service
system.
if
what
you
want
to
do
is
create
a
situation
where
everybody
is
suing
everybody
on
the
same
issue--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
they
are
seeking
both
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
think
that
might--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--there
is
a
factor--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--it
is
not
quite
that,
because
the
workers
themselves
are
really
not
the
plaintiffs
here.
we
are
arguing
against
the
commonwealth,
and
not
the...
not
the
worker.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
yes.
i
would
say
that
it
is
in
part
a
corollary
of
that
rule,
that
in
effect
what
they
should
have
said
to
their
workers,
look,
there
is
a
complaint
system
that
is
set
up.
if
you
have
a
grievance,
file
your
complaint
and
we
will
assist
you.
in
fact,
the
regulations
actually
say
that
the
state
agency
should
assist
the
worker
in
pursuing
its
claim.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
don't
concede
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
for
the
reason
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
oh,
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
well,
i
think
we
would
have
that
right
to
raise
that,
too,
your
honor,
not
just
the
state
has
the
right
to
raise
that
argument.
i
think
we...
you
know,
we
are
the
targets...
we
are
the
targets
of
these
complaints,
and
if
there
is
a
procedure,
an
administrative
procedure
set
forth,
especially
with
a
party
which
is
a
member
of
this
employment
service
system.
you
know,
they
receive
funding
from
the
united
states
department
of
labor
to
participate
in
this
system,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
must
have
some
obligation
to
follow
the
regulations
which
administer
this
system
and
regulate
the
system.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
there
is
no
difference.
in
effect,
the
puerto
rican
workers
are
considered
u.s.
workers
for
purposes
of
the
law--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--it
seems
to
me
the
same
principle
would
apply.
the
same
principle
would
apply
whether
we
are
talking
about
puerto
rico
or
the
state
of
michigan
or
the
state
of
texas
or
the
state
of
florida.
states
which...
the
southern
states
are
most
of
the
labor
supply
states
in
this
program.
that
is
where
most
of
the
farm
labor
comes
from.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
going
to
grant
parens
patriae
standing
to
the
commonwealth,
which
i
don't
think
you
should,
i
am
not
sure
how
you
distinguish
the
commonwealth
situation
from
the
state
of
texas
or
the
state
of
florida.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
have
been
a
couple
of
amicus
curiae
briefs
filed
by
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
so
there
is
obviously...
there
are
some
states
out
there
who
are
anxious
to
pursue
their
rights
and
bring
lawsuits
if
the
court
so
permits.
the
complaint
in
this
case
sets
forth
three
different
categories
of
alleged
violations.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
if
it
is
not
under
article
iii,
i
am
not
sure
where
else
you
would
find
it--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
would
be
hard-pressed
to
give
you
another
basis
for
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
ultimately,
it
really,
it
seems
to
me
it
turned
on
an
interpretation
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act,
and
not
really
article
iii
considerations.
it
got
into
a
question
of
double
recovery
of
damages--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--yes,
they
were.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
yes,
they
were,
your
honor,
but
i
think
justice
marshal
noted
early
on
that
even
though
he
was
going
to
explore
the
history
of
parens
patriae,
the
case
really
did
not
turn
on
the
concept
of
parens
patriae.
i
think
hawaii
is
important
because
of
its
discussion
that
there
was
reference
to
the
answer
from
justice
brennan
earlier
that
there
has
never
been
this
distinction
certainly
in
this
court
and
most
certainly
in
the
lower
courts,
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
these...
the
standards
that
apply
to
parens
patriae
apply
whether
we
are
talking
about
a
case
arising
under
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
or
one
that
is
brought
in
the
district
court,
and
it
applies
whether
we
are
talking
about
damages
or
it
applies
whether
we
are
talking
about
injunctive
relief.
i
would
note
that
in
pennsylvania
v.
new
jersey,
the
state
of...
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
was
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
they
weren't
really
seeking
damages
in
that
case,
and
yet
this
court
denied
parens
patriae
standing.
the
court
said
that
in
effect
they
were
trying
to
sue
on
behalf
of
their
individual
citizens
claims
which
those
citizens
could
bring
on
their
own.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
why
couldn't
who
do
that,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
they
couldn't.
you
say--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--what
was
the
reason?
the
fact
that
they
were
in
effect
pursuing
the
individual
claims
of
their
citizens
which
those
citizens
could
pursue
themselves.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
would
say
it
is
both.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
would
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
believe
they
should,
your
honor.
they
should
use
the
same
standards.
in
fact,
they
generally
have
used
the
same
standards.
we
have--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--when
an
association
is
suing
on
behalf
of
its
members,
its
members
actually
have...
or
at
least
the
association
must
allege
that
the
actions
affect
the
members,
and
therefore
that
the
members
are
synonymous
with
the
association.
i
am
not
so
sure
we
can
make
this
assumption
in
the
case
of
a
state.
the...
cannot
identify
the
state
or
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
necessarily
with
the
individual
citizens.
otherwise,
all
elections
would
be
decided
100
percent
to
zero
percent.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--your
honor,
i
don't
recall
the
details
of
the
sierra
club
case,
but
i
would
be
bothered
by
that
analysis
if
that
were
the
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
the
complaint
alleges
three
categories
of
violations,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
violations
that
are
alleged.
the
first
category
is
an
alleged
failure
to
provide
employment
to
puerto
ricans,
and
here,
however,
we
have
two
subcategories.
with
respect
to
ten
growers,
the
alleged
failure
to
provide
employment
is
based
on
the
fact
that
their
puerto
rican
workers
never
left
the
island
of
puerto
rico
as
a
result
of
the
cancellation
of
their
flights.
in
fact,
this
is
the
only
allegation
in
the
complaint
against
four
of
the
virginia
growers
named
in
this
complaint,
the
fact
that
their
workers
never
left
puerto
rico
because
the
united
states
department
of
labor
cancelled
their
flights.
eight
other
growers
allegedly
denied
employment
to
puerto
ricans
who
showed
up
at
their
orchards.
with
respect
to
these
eight,
at
least
seven
of
them
also
allegedly
did
other
things
to
their
workers.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
a
blanket
refusal
to
employ.
even
in
the
case
of
the
eight
who
allegedly
refused
to
hire
those
who
arrived,
they
actually
hired
other
puerto
rican
workers,
even
if
we
accept
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
here.
i
see
that
i
have
five
minutes
left,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
just
have
a
few
points.
first,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
agreed
on
the
proper
test
to
apply
in
determining
parens
patriae
standing.
both
courts
said,
you
look
at
the
size
of
the
segment
of
the
population
affected.
you
look
at
the
magnitude
of
the
harm,
and
you
look
at
the
ability
of
those
injured
to
rectify
the
alleged
wrongs
on
their
own.
the
disagreement
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
was
not
on
what
test
to
apply,
but
how
that
test
applied
to
these
particular
facts.
we
agree
with
justice
marshal
that
787
workers,
which
are
the
only
workers
that
are
covered
by
this
particular
complaint,
despite
insinuations
by
counsel
to
the
contrary,
the
only
growers
involved
in
this
case
are
the
virginia
apple
growers,
32
virginia
apple
growers.
the
only
puerto
ricans
involved
are
the
787
who
allegedly
accepted
those
jobs
in
1978.
that
787
number
constitutes
3/100ths
of
1
percent
of
the
1970
population
of
puerto
rico.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
i
didn't
catch
that.
i
didn't
catch
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
but
it
is
still
not
a
significant
portion
of
the
population--
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
--or
of
the
labor
force
of
puerto
rico,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
bacas
i
believe,
if...
there
have
been
many
parens
patriae
suits.
i
believe
that
is
probably
one
of
the
ones
involving
diversion
of
water
or
some
other
injury
to
the
land,
and
also
a
dispute
between
actions
in
one
state
that
have
an
immediate
effect
in
another
state.
i
would
submit
that
those
are
substantially
different
from
this
case,
where
the
alleged
quasi-sovereign
interest
turns
on
the
harm
to
the
general
economy
of
the
state.
if
the
parens
patriae
test
could
be
satisfied
in
this
case,
it
could
be
satisfied
in
virtually
any
case,
and
i
don't
believe
the
parens
patriae
test
has
been
broadened
that
much
over
the
years.
mr.
lenzini
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
are
upwards
of
five
to
7,000
jobs
in
which
he
can
place
puerto
rican
workers,
but
what
he
is
talking
about,
he
is
talking
about
the
entire
east
coast
apple
harvest,
and
i
want
to
stress,
we
have
states
which
aren't
even
involved
in
the
1978
program.
the
complaint
alleges
that
puerto
rican
workers
were
sent
to
only
four
states.
they
were
sent
to
virginia,
west
virginia,
maryland,
and
new
york.
he
leaves
out
the
six
new
england
states,
which
evidently
received
no
puerto
rican
workers
in
1978.
so
when
he
talks
about
a
larger
number,
he
is
not
talking
about
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
787
puerto
rican
workers.
we
are
talking
about
32
virginia
apple
growers.
obviously,
a
number
of
you
have
pointed
out,
the
standing
cannot
turn
on
the
unemployment
rate
in
puerto
rico,
or
in
any
state.
i
would
note
that
the
unemployment
figures
are
cited
in
the...
page
8
of
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
they
show
that
the
unemployment
rate
was
19.9
in
1977,
the
year
before.
in
1978,
it
was
18.1
percent.
in
1979,
the
year
after,
it
was
17
percent.
i
don't
know
how
a
constitutional
concept
of
standing
can
turn
on
such
a
fluctuating
standard
of
unemployment
rate.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make,
the
last
point,
is
that
there
is
no
allegation
of
a
boycott
in
the
complaint,
and
there
is
no
allegation
of
conspiracy
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
merely
alleges
that
certain
individual
puerto
ricans
have
individual
grievances
against
individual
growers.
thank
you.
