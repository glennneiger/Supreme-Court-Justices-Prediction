unknown
speaker
do
you
acknowledge
that
whoever
committed
the
robbery
at
the
supermarket
that
you
have
just
described
left
some
fingerprints
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
today
we're
only
really
concerned
about
one
of
them,
aren't
we.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second?
the
question
presented
that
you
framed
in
your
brief
is
whether
or
not
a
confession
taken
from
petitioner
following
a
warrantless
arrest
based
on
less
than
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you...
for
purposes
of
our
consideration
of
the
case,
do
we
assume
there
was
less
than
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
why
are
you
arguing...
are
you
arguing
that
there
was
no
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
and
why
are
you
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
is
that
in
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
an
issue
in
the
alabama
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
that
is
open
to
the
respondent
to
make
that
claim
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
relying
on
for
the
proposition
that
there's
no
probable
cause,
aguilar
and
spinelli?
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably
that's
not
open
to
you
if
that's
a
state
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
aguilar
and
spinelli
were
both
warrant
cases,
weren't
they?
there
was
no
warrant
here.
unknown
speaker
to
be
supplied
to
a
neutral
magistrate.
unknown
speaker
but
here
you're
not
talking
about
a
neutral--
unknown
speaker
--was
he
fingerprinted
again
after
that
occasion?
unknown
speaker
was
he
fingerprinted
a
second
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
those
were
the
only
fingerprints
that
were
introduced.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
were
the
fingerprints
taken
immediately
after
arrest
excluded?
they
were
excluded?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
and
the
trial
court
then
ruled
that,
a,
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
arrest--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
fingerprints
were
excludable
as
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
arrest--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
the
alabama
supreme
court
holds
that
the
taint
has
been
removed.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
what...
but
the
trial
court...
and
did
the
alabama
supreme
court
disagree
with
the
holding
that
there
was
no
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
disagree
with
the
ruling
that
the
first
set
of
fingerprints
were
fruit
of
an
illegal
arrest?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
how
is
the
admissibility
of
the
fingerprints
that
were
taken
before
the
arrest
before
the
court?
it
seems
to
me
that
as
i
recall
that
evidence
was
suppressed.
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
didn't
cross-appeal--
unknown
speaker
--on
that.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
issue
is
even
before
us.
unknown
speaker
you
want
us
to
look
at
it
as
one
of
the
dunaway
cases?
unknown
speaker
they
never
used
those
fingerprints.
unknown
speaker
they
never
used
those
first
set
of
fingerprints.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
took
the
fingerprints
in
the
courtroom.
is
there
anything
that
you
can
think
of
when
you've
got
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
that
forbids
taking
his
fingerprints
or
his
picture
or
getting
a
sample
of
his
handwriting?
unknown
speaker
did
the
trial
court...
i
am
confused
about
what
happened
where
in
this
case.
did
the
trial
court
suppress
anything?
unknown
speaker
the
first
fingerprints.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
confession--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
all
these
things
that
happened--
unknown
speaker
--have
we
got
to
go
to
search
the
record
to
find
them,
or
did
you
file
something
other
than
this
brief?
unknown
speaker
have
you
filed
any
brief
in
addition
to
this?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
have
it.
i
just
don't
have
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
one
here,
but
i
didn't
have
it.
i
don't
have
it,
either.
it
was
filed
one
day
late.
unknown
speaker
it
was
filed
one
day
late.
unknown
speaker
my
point
is,
your
original
brief
doesn't
give
us
anything.
you've
got
six
cases
cited.
the
whole
thing
from
beginning
to
end
is
nine
pages.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
all
you
think
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
doesn't
the
rule
say
that
you
give
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
brief?
or
did
you
not
look
at
the
rules?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
a
magistrate
issued
a
warrant
for
his
arrest,
i
presume
you
would
have
argued
that
it
was
subject
to
attack.
unknown
speaker
so
getting
a
warrant
wouldn't
have
improved
their
case.
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
talk
about
exigent
circumstances
and
having
two
weeks?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
there
was.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
found
that
the
fingerprints
were
inadmissible
and
had
to
be
suppressed,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
weren't
they
kept
out,
presumably,
because
the
arrested
was
illegal?
unknown
speaker
right.
and
didn't
you...
didn't
the
state
virtually
concede
that
at
the
time,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
so
everybody
assumed
at
the
trial
court
level
there
was
no
probable
cause
and
the
confession
came
in
under
the
dunaway
concept,
isn't
that
basically
right?
unknown
speaker
intervening
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
not
a
fruit
of
an
illegal
arrest.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
state
didn't
appeal
that
finding
of
no
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
and
you
never
appealed
the
trial
court's
exclusionary
order.
unknown
speaker
so
presumably
that
issue
is
at
rest.
so
do
we
not
have
to
assume,
then,
that
the
arrest
was
illegal?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
but
you
also
have
with
you
the
favorable
ruling
on
the
pretrial
suppression
motion,
which
refused
to
exclude
the
confession,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
appealed
as
a
part
of
the
defendant's
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
based
on
the
notion
that
there
was
probable
cause,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
general
allison,
i'm
curious
about
one
thing.
didn't
i
detect
something
in
the
record
about
a
request
on
his
part
during
this
period
for
an
attorney?
unknown
speaker
of
course
there
are
some
parallels.
in
both
dunaway
and
this
case,
it
was
a
man
in
jail
who
made
the
suggestion.
unknown
speaker
and
in
this
case
martin
himself
was
ultimately
convicted,
was
he
not,
or
implicated
at
least,
in
the
robbery?
unknown
speaker
what
did
martin
get
as
a
result
of
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
he
end
up
with?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allison,
i
take
it
from
your
argument
you're
not
going
to
press
upon
us
the
necessity
to
apply
some
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
or
any
modification
of
it?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
finding
by
the
courts
below
specifically
of
the
good
faith
of
the
officers?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
point
to
any
specific
finding
in
the
courts
below
on
the
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
did
they
know
what
the
petitioner
looked
like
before
they
went
out
and
picked
him
up?
unknown
speaker
so
that
we
can't
assume
that
they
relied
on
the
description,
then?
the
record
suggested
to
me
they
relied
entirely
on
officer
mobley's
conversation
with
this
man,
with
martin.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
he
didn't
arrest
him
himself,
if
i
understand.
he
got
two
other
officers
to
go
out
and
pick
him
up,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
in
that
relay
did
he
tell
him
what
the
respondent
looked
like...
what
the
petitioner
looked
like?
unknown
speaker
they're
covered
quite
fully
in
your
brief,
i
think,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
the
court's
familiar
thoroughly
with
waldor,
because
we
reaffirmed
that
in
harris
against
new
york
many
years
later.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't...
i
didn't
think
you
were
making
any
claim
that
the
confession
was
coerced;
are
you?
you're
just
saying
it's
a
product
of
an
illegal
arrest.
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
never
raised
the
made
a
coerced
confession
claim
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that's
quite
different
from
coercion.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
he's
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't...
if
there
were
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
the
arrest
had
been
legal,
you
don't
suggest
that
any
of
this
evidence
would
then
be
inadmissible,
do
you?
if
there
had
been
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
exactly,
exactly.
so
if
the
police
officers
mistakenly
thought
there
was
probable
cause
but
there
wasn't,
they
just
proceeded
as
though
there
was.
unknown
speaker
what
makes
you
think
that's
so
outrageous?
i
mean,
they
may
be
wrong.
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
law
it
may
be
that
the
evidence
is
inadmissible.
what
makes
their
conduct
so
outrageous?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
this
wasn't
the
only
case
on
the
police
blotter,
was
it?
