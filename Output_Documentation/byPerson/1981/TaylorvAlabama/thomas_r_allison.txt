mr.
thomas
r.
allison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
prior
to
the
trial
in
omar
taylor's
case,
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
and
to
declare
the
arrest
illegal
was
filed.
a
full-blown
hearing
was
held
and
much
testimony
taken.
at
the
end
of
this
hearing
the
trial
judge
denied
this
motion
and
found
the
confession
admissible
on
the--
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
--the
fingerprint
issue
arose
in
the
trial,
and
the
very
first
time
that
the
fingerprint
issue
came
up,
on
page
20
of
the
record,
the
trial
judge
says:
now,
then
you
come
along
and
you
say
that
you
object
to
the
fingerprints
because
of
the
illegal
arrest
and
because
of
the
language
of
davis
v.
mississippi.
and
the
content
in
which
the
fingerprints
were
objected
to
was
the
admissibility
of
the
fingerprint
comparison
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
fingerprint
issue
was
argued.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
the
reason
that
the
trial
judge
suppressed
those
fingerprints
and
ordered
him
re-fingerprinted
was
that
he
considered,
apparently,
the
arrest
based
on
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
reading
the
arguments
of
the
district
attorney,
he
attempts
to
establish
probable
cause,
but
concedes
that
the
arrest
was
based
on
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that
is
exactly
what
the
trial
judge
said.
there
are
circumstances
under
dunaway
that
would
make
this
confession
admissible.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
no,
sir.
there
were
certain
attenuation
factors
that
i
will
compare
shortly.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
on
argument
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
the
state
argued
that
there
was
probable
cause,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
rejected
that
argument.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
no,
your
honor,
there
was
no
appeal
on
the
exclusionary
order.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
was
based
on
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
to
the
alabama
appellate
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
the
one
issue
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
considered
was,
is
a
voluntarily
given
confession
admissible
in
an
instance
where
there
is
less
than
probable
cause.
and
what
the
alabama
appellate
court
did
was
to
look
at
dunaway
and
brown
and
to
weigh
the
facts,
and
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
found
nothing
to
distinguish
omar
taylor's
case
from
brown
and
dunaway.
then
on
appeal
the
alabama
supreme
court
reviewed
the
decision
of
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
alabama
supreme
court
found
that
the
causal
connection
between
the
illegal
risk
and
the
confession
had
been
sufficiently
broken,
and
that
any
taint
of
an
illegal
arrest
had
been
sufficiently
attenuated
by
the
three
factors
as
set
forth
in
brown
and
dunaway.
and
what
i
would
first
like
to
do
is
to
look
at
these
three
factors
as
set
forth
in
brown
and
dunaway,
and
to
see
the
correctness
of
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
the
three
factors:
first
of
all,
the
first
factor
is
the
temporal
proximity
of
the
arrest
and
the
confession.
in
both
brown
and
dunaway,
the
defendant
was
arrested
and
had
confessed
in
less
than
two
hours.
in
taylor's
case
there
was
a
period
of
six
hours.
and
in
order
to
show
the
importance
of
the
six-hour
period,
we
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
that
occurred.
we
know
that
there
are
four
things
that
occurred
during
this
period
of
time,
and
we
know
the
approximate
time,
or
the
record
shows
the
approximate
time
in
three
of
these.
when
omar
taylor
was
arrested
at
3:00
p.m.
in
the
afternoon
and
taken
directly
to
the
police
station,
the
first
thing
that
happened,
he
was
processed.
he
was
fingerprinted,
he
was
photographed,
and
by
his
own
statement
they
talked
to
him
for
15
minutes.
we
know
then
that
he
was
taken
directly
to
a
lineup.
according
to
omar
taylor's
estimate,
this
lineup
lasted
one
hour.
then,
ten
minutes
later,
detective
wilson
read
him
his
miranda
rights
and
confronted
him
with
the
fingerprint
comparison.
while
he
was
being
placed
in
the
lineup,
the
police
officers
had
taken
the
latent
print
from
the
crime
scene,
they
had
compared
them
with
these
roll
prints,
and
he
was
confronted
with
these
prints
and
he
declined
to
make
any
statement.
he
was
then
placed
in
his
cell.
then
omar
taylor
says,
that
afternoon
i
talked
to
my
girlfriend
and
i
confessed.
but
it
was
not
the
girl...
but
it
was
not
that
afternoon.
if
you
look
at
the
record,
his
confession
came
at
9:00
p.m.
that
night.
so
if
you
add
up
this
time
between
3:00
p.m.
and
9:00
p.m.
that
night,
some
six
hours,
the
activities
that
occurred
immediately
after
his
arrest
consumed
some
two
and
a
half
hours,
approximately,
or
three
hours
at
the
most.
but
this
leaves
a
three-hour
period,
and
this
is
important,
i
think,
from
the
length
of
time,
because
during
this
period
he
sat
in
the
solitude
of
his
cell.
he
had
an
opportunity
to
compose
his
thoughts
and
to
ensure
that
the
confession
was
a
product
of
his
free
will.
the
second
factor
to
be
considered,
intervening
circumstances.
in
brown
and
dunaway
there
were
none.
but
i
think
there
are
several
circumstances
that
are
significant
and
should
be
considered.
first
of
all,
i
use
the
period
of
solitude
in
his
cell
as
an
example
to
show
what
happened
to
him
during
this
six-hour
period.
but
i
think
as
an
intervening
circumstance
we
would
have
to
consider
this
period
of
solitude
in
his
cell.
his
miranda
rights
were
read
to
him
or
given
to
him
on
three
occasions,
and
the
final
time
was
just
minutes
before
he
confessed.
omar
taylor
was
a
twelfth
grade
student,
and
just
before
making
his
confession
the
police
also
read
him
his
miranda
rights.
he
gave
him
a
copy,
omar
taylor
read
it
and
signed
the
waiver
of
rights
form.
another
intervening
circumstance
is
the
visit
between
omar
taylor's
girlfriend
and
neighbor.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
versions
of
exactly
what
happened
when
you
look
at
the
record.
omar
taylor
gives
a
different
version
from
that
of
the
police
officer.
according
to
the
police
officer,
at
8:50
p.m.
that
night
he
took
omar
taylor
out
of
his
cell,
read
him
his
miranda
rights,
and
had
been
talking
to
him
for
approximately
ten
minutes.
at
that
time
omar
taylor's
girlfriend
and
neighbor
arrived.
she
wanted
to
talk
to
omar
taylor.
omar
taylor
wanted
to
talk
to
her.
so
the
police
officer
allowed
them
to
have
a
private
conversation
in
the
detective's
office.
after
this
private
conversation,
approximately
ten
minutes,
omar
taylor
confessed.
but
i
think
that
as
an
intervening
circumstance
you
would
have
to
consider
the
conversation,
in
which
omar
taylor
was
free
to
discuss
anything
in
the
privacy
there
with
a
person
with
whom
he
was
very
closely
associated.
and
the
last
intervening
circumstance
which
is
given
weight
by
the
alabama
supreme
court...
and
this
is
prior
to
the
confession...
an
arrest
warrant
was
obtained
based
on
an
affidavit
that
the
officers
made.
this
affidavit
included
information
about
the
fingerprint
information.
the
arrest
warrant
was
issued
prior
to
the
confession.
during
the
exclusion...
during
the
motion
to
exclude
the
confession,
this
evidence
pertaining
to
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant
was
placed
before
the
trial
judge.
during
this
hearing
the
information
was
before
him
that
these
fingerprints
were
used
as
a
basis
for
the
warrant.
there
was
no
specific
objection
on
this
point.
the
first
time
that
the
fingerprint
issue
arose
was
in
the
trial
itself,
when
the
district
attorney
attempted
to
introduce
into
evidence
a
comparison
of
the
fingerprints
from
the
roll
prints
and
the
fingerprints
from
the
crime
scene,
at
which
time
the
trial
court
sustained
the
objection
and
ordered
the
defendant
re-fingerprinted.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
there
is
a
conflict
of
testimony
on
this
point.
the
two
police
officers
that
testified
both
stated,
no,
he
did
not
ask
for
an
attorney.
detective
hicks
very
clearly
testified
on
two
occasions,
no,
he
never
requested
an
attorney.
so
what
you
have,
i
think
that
when
the
trial
judge
considered
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
he
was
considering
two
things
when
he
considered
this
first
motion.
he
was
considering
also
a
fifth
amendment
question,
the
voluntariness
of
that
confession.
and
in
considering
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
it,
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
had
to
consider
this
conflict
of
testimony
between
the
officer
and
then
the
defendant.
the
defendant
said
a
number
of
things.
he
said,
i
signed
the
statement
of
rights
form
after
i
confessed.
but
then
when
he
was
shown
the
date
on
it,
he
changed
the
story
and
said,
no,
i
believe
i
signed
the
statement
of
rights
form
before
i
confessed.
but
i
would
say
that
there
you
have
a
direct
conflict
of
testimony
that
had
to
be
resolved
by
the
trial
court.
the
third
factor
that
i
would
like
to
look
at
is
the
purpose
and
the
flagrancy
of
the
official
misconduct
of
the
officers.
i
want
to
compare
the
conduct
of
the
officers
in
this
case
with
that
in
davis
v.
mississippi,
dunaway
and
brown.
in
davis,
the
police
officers
had
a
latent
fingerprint
from
a
crime
scene.
the
only
description
the
rape
victim
could
give
was
that
it
was
a
young
negro
youth.
that
was
all.
the
police
go
out
in
a
dragnet
situation
and
arrest
some
24
people,
in
a
complete
absence
of
probable
cause.
in
dunaway,
the
officers
maintained
that
the
defendant
was
simply
detained.
they
did
not
arrest
him,
they
maintained.
they
merely
took
him
to
the
police
station
for
interrogation.
the
information
in
dunaway
came
from
a
person
being
held
in
jail.
it
passed
through
several
hands.
we
find
a
completely
different
situation
when
you
look
at
the
fact
situation
in
taylor.
in
brown,
brown
was
nothing
more
than
an
associate
of
a
murder
victim.
he
was
not
even
a
real
suspect.
and
yet
the
officers
go
to
his
apartment
at
7:30
at
night,
they
search
his
apartment
without
a
warrant.
they
jump
out
and
arrest
him,
and
they
arrest
him
in
such
a
manner
that
would
cause
fright
and
shock
and
confusion.
they
take
him
to
the
police
station.
he
has
confessed
in
less
than
two
hours.
in
taylor's
case,
the
investigation
had
focused
on
one
individual,
omar
taylor.
the
officers
go
to
omar
taylor
and
they
say,
omar
taylor,
you
are
under
arrest
for
the
robbery
of
moseley's
grocery,
and
they
take
him
to
the
police
station.
i
want
to
look
at
the
probable
cause
that
the
officers
had.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
when
omar
taylor
gave
his
statement,
he
named
charles
martin
as
his
accomplice.
i
think
that
we
can
show
that
in
this
case
there
is
much
more
probable
cause
and
there's
much
that
would
distinguish
this
case
from
dunaway.
some
20
days
after
the
robbery
of
moseley's
grocery...
and
this
robbery
of
moseley's
grocery
had
been
one
of
a
series
of
armed
robberies
in
the
same
neighborhood.
20
days
after
the
robbery,
charles
martin
was
arrested
in
a
robbery
in
the
same
neighborhood.
during
the
week
following
the
arrest
of
charles
martin,
detective
mobley
began
to
talk
to
martin.
he
knew
martin
as
one
of
the
three
suspects
in
the
moseley's
grocery
robbery.
charles
martin
and
detective
mobley
began
to
have
conversations
over
a
period
of
a
whole
week.
on
numerous
occasions
mobley
talked
to
martin.
he
impressed
upon
him
the
importance
of
telling
the
truth
if
he
wanted
the
information
to
be
known
to
the
judge.
he
emphasizes
the
adverse
consequences
that
any
false
information
would
have.
detective
mobley
said,
that
over
a
period
of
a
week,
i
developed
a
rapport
with
this
man.
he
convinced
me
that
he
was
telling
the
truth.
now,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
testimony,
because
on
one
or
two
occasions
mobley
says,
charles
martin
told
me
he
heard.
and
i'm
sure
that
over
a
period
of
talking
to
this
man
for
at
least
a
week,
i'm
sure
that
on
occasion
he
said,
i
heard,
but
on
other
occasions
he
said,
i
know.
and
the
district
attorney
attempted
to
clarify
this
point.
on
page
15
of
the
record,
which
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix...
part
of
page
15
is...
but
on
page
15,
on
redirect
examination
the
district
attorney
attempts
to
clarify
this
point.
he
asks
the
direct
question:
"now,
when
martin
gave
you
this
information,
was
it
in
the
sense
that
omar
taylor
did
the
robbery
or
x
told
me
that
omar
taylor
did
the
robbery?
"
and
his
answer
was:
"it
was
in
the
sense
that
omar
taylor
was
involved.
"
he
repeatedly
told
him
that
he
knew
that
he
was
involved.
on
the
following
page
he
states:
"he
didn't
say
anything
else
other
than
the
fact
that
he
knew
that
omar
taylor
was
involved
in
the
robbery.
"
i
think
that
an
experienced
police
officer,
knowing
that
charles
martin
was
a
suspect
in
the
very
same
robbery,
i
think
that
an
experienced
police
officer
would
know
that
this
man
could
not
tell
him
how
he
knew
without
confessing,
without
saying,
i
was
there
standing
beside
him
and
robbing
mr.
moseley.
the
officer
knew
that
he
could
not
tell
all
the
circumstances
or
the
basis
of
his
information,
but
i
think
the
fact
that
this
man
was
known
as
one
of
the
three
suspects
gave
weight
to
this
officer's
information
and
his
belief--
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
--the
record
does
not
show
what
the
police
officer
told
him.
he
said,
if
you
give
me
reliable
information
i
will
see
that
any
help
you
have
given
us
will
be
presented
to
the
trial
judge
for
whatever
benefit
he
can
give
you.
he
could
not
promise
him
anything,
but
he
could
only
tell
him
that
the
judge
would
be
made
aware
of
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
the
record
shows
nothing
about
charles
martin
and
his
sentence
in
his
case.
i
think
that--
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
--what
i
would
ask
your
honor
is
that...
i
think
i'm
going
to
look
a
little
bit
further
in
the
probable
cause
area,
but
i
think
what
you
will
find
is
that
if
the
officers
were
technically
short
of
probable
cause,
that
they
acted
in
good
faith;
that
whether
they
acted
in
good
faith
could
not
be
a
subjective
matter
with
the
officers.
you
would
have
to
look
at
it
in
an
objective
manner.
but
if
there
is
an
objective,
reasonable
basis
for
that
belief,
then
you
find
this
evidence
admissible
under
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
as
set
forth
in
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
united
states
v.
williams.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
when
they
discussed
the
exclusionary
rule,
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
exactly
what
they
had
in
mind
it
is
a
detailed
history
and
discussion
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
but
your
honor,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
your
interpretation
of
the
second
half
of
the
opinion
is
open
to
interpretation,
i
would
think,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
your
honor,
there
was
none.
but
to
conclude
in
the
area
of
probable
cause,
i
don't
think
that
in
the
suppression
hearing
the
extent
of
probable
cause
was
ever
brought...
or
was
fully
developed.
the
officers
had...
also
had
a
description,
not
like
davis
v.
mississippi,
but
of
a
colored
male,
five
foot
six
inches,
150
pounds,
20
to
25
years
old.
the
record
doesn't
even
show--
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
--your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say.
the
record
is
completely
silent.
this
was
never
developed.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
that
is
an
accurate
interpretation.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
he
relayed
the
information
to
a
detective,
i
believe
it
was
detective
alford,
i
believe,
who
actually
made
the
arrest.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
the
record
is
silent.
it
doesn't
go
into
that.
and
if
you'd
like
me
to,
i
would
make
my
remarks
about
the
exclusionary
rule.
if
you
don't
want
to
hear
those,
then--
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
--with
the
exception
of
one
thing,
if
i
might
add,
that
in
the
past
this
court
has
used
a
balancing
process
in
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
a
number
of
cases
this
court
has
stated
exactly
what
factors
were
balanced.
in
u.s.
v.
calandra
this
court
weighed
the
potential
injury
to
the
functions
of
a
grand
jury
on
the
one
hand
and
the
effect
the
suppression
of
evidence
would
have
as
to
a
deterrence
of
police
misconduct
on
the
other,
and
this
court
found
that
illegally
seized
evidence
could
be
admitted
as
an
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
waldor
v.
united
states,
this
court
weighed
the
need
to
prevent
perjury
and
the
public
interest
in
determining
the
truth
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
interest
safeguarded
by
the
exclusionary
rule
on
the
other,
and
this
court
that
illegally
seized
evidence
could
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
in
michigan
v.
tucker,
this
court
weighed
society's
interest
in
the
effective
prosecution
of
criminals
on
the
one
hand
and
the
need
to
provide
an
effective
sanction
to
a
constitutional
right
on
the
other.
mr.
thomas
r.
allison
your
honor,
what
i
would
ask
the
court
to
do
if
they
found
this
evidence
otherwise
inadmissible
is
to
weigh
society's
interest
in
the
prevention
of
crime
on
the
one
hand
and
the
benefits
derived
in
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
an
objective
good
faith
situation
on
the
other,
and
consider...
i'll
name
these
very
briefly...
the
high
cost
to
society
in
the
release
of
criminals.
you
can
see
the
agony
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
when
they
say,
we
are
loath
to
reverse
the
conviction
of
a
man
so
obviously
guilty.
guilt
drips
from
the
fingers
of
both
hands,
and
yet
we
are
lighted
by...
our
path
is
lighted
by
dunaway.
consider
the
suppression
of
the
truth
in
a
criminal
trial.
here
what
could
be
more
reliable
than
fingerprints?
consider
judicial
integrity.
consider
the
reaction
of
the
public
in
what
they
see,
where
robbers,
murderers,
rapists
are
released
on
what
the
public
calls
a
technicality.
and
consider
that
judicial
integrity
is
not
injured
to
the
same
extent
when
there
is
a
good
faith
mistake
on
the
part
of
officers.
and
consider
proportionality.
consider
the
difference
between
the
flagrant
violation
on
the
one
hand
and
the
good
faith
action
of
the
police
officers
on
the
other.
