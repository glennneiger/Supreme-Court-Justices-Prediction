mr.
robert
m.
beno
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court:
this
case
comes
out
of
the
state
of
alabama
in
reference
to
an
arrest
made
on
january
4,
1979.
now,
the
background,
which
i
think
is
very
important
in
all
criminal
cases,
especially
when
the
fourth
amendment
is
involved,
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
applicable
to
the
record
generally
turn...
make
the
case
turn
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
there
was
a
robbery,
without
question,
on
the
2nd
day
of
december,
1978.
subsequent
to
that
time,
in
the
middle
days
of
december
a
charles
martin
was
arrested
in
reference
to
a
completely
different
and
separate
rape
and
robbery,
and
he
was
in
the
county...
or
in
the
city
jail
in
montgomery,
alabama.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
there's
no
argument
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
in
fact,
one
issue
here
is
whether
or
not...
there
are
several...
how
many
people
were
involved
in
the
robbery.
initially--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--the
fingerprints
and
the
confession,
right.
and
at
the
trial
we
didn't
argue
and
did
not
move
to
suppress
the
fingerprints
taken
from
the
hotdogs
and
the
package
of
sugar.
that's
not
at
issue
here.
the
point
here
today
is
whether
or
not,
first
of
all,
there
was
an
illegal
arrest.
that's
a
critical
issue,
because
if
there's
no
illegal
arrest
there's
no
need
to
be
in
front
of
the
court
today.
we
have
a
situation
where
mr.
martin
said
to
the
police
officer,
mr.
mobley...
i
think
if
you'll
refer
to
the
record
at
page
7
of
the
record,
his
statement
to
the
court
was
that
he
had
heard...
that's
not
in
the
appendix,
that's
in
the
record...
he
had
heard.
at
which
time
i
moved
or
i
objected,
and
there
was
a
discussion
in
front
of
the
court
and
in
front
of
the
officer,
and
during
that
discussion
the
judge
came
to
the
conclusion
and
stated
that,
well,
i
think
that
this,
what
he
heard
from
someone
else,
if
it
cannot
be
substantiated,
certainly
cannot
be
grounds
to
base
a
credibility
upon
which
an
arrest
can
follow.
well,
if
you'll
notice,
on
page
15...
no,
on
page
13
of
the
record,
after
this
discussion
is
over
we
come
back
and
we
ask
mr.
mobley
another
question,
and
now
he
says:
"well,
i
don't
know
where
he
got
it.
"
"i
don't
know
where
he
got
it.
"
this
certainly...
the
element
of
credibility
is
involved
here.
once
in
front
of
the
court
and
the
court
has
said
that,
well,
just
hearing
this
is
not
sufficient,
it
appears
that
his
testimony
changes.
i
think
that's
critical,
because
credibility
is
very
important
when
this
court
decides
this
case.
at
any
rate--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
that's
correct.
that's
what
i'm
getting
ready
to
show
you.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
now,
mr.
martin,
who
was
as
i
said
an
alleged...
or
a
suspect
in
a
separate
and
completely
different
rape
and
robbery,
was
then
questioned
at
the
police
station
by
mr.
mobley,
all
right.
now,
he
said,
and
it's
on
the
record,
that
he
had
heard
such
and
such.
the
court
then
said:
well,
hearsay
is
fine
if
it's
credible
and
can
be
substantiated
or
give
some
credibility
in
reference
to
the
statement.
well,
the
question
was
asked
to
mr.
mobley,
was
there
anything
that
you
can
base
your
credibility
or
you
can
give
credit...
credibility
to
the
informant?
well,
your
honor,
all
he
told
me
was
that
he
had
heard.
he
did
not
tell
me
who
he
heard
it
from
or
how
he
got
this
knowledge.
i
would
suggest,
based
on
that
and
quite
frankly
until
this
brief
by
petitioner...
i
mean,
by
respondent...
it
has
never
been
argued
that
there
was
probable
cause.
in
fact,
at
the
oral
argument
in
front
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
he
readily
admitted
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
in
fact,
one
of
the
judges
at
that
time
indicated
that,
well,
i
was
kind
of
thinking
about
reversing
this
case,
but
if
you
admit
that
there's
no
probable
cause
i'm
going
to
have
a
little
bit
more
difficulty.
well,
now
he
suggests,
and
he
tries
to
gloss
over
this
failure
to
produce
probable
cause
by
saying
that,
well,
we
did
have
probable
cause
perhaps.
he
says
that
this
mr.
martin
was
a
suspect
in
the
robbery
at
moseley's
grocery
store
at
that
time.
well,
the
record
indicates
that
the
only
reason
he
was
a
suspect
is
because
he
was
arrested
on
some
other
robberies.
and
another
time
in
the
record
he
says,
well,
he
was
a
suspect
to
me.
he
never
indicates
any
reason
on
which
to
base
his
suspicion
that
mr.
martin
was
even
a
suspect,
other
than
the
fact
that
he
was
in
jail
on
another
crime.
i
don't
believe
that
can
be
sufficient
evidence
on
which
to
give
credibility.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
simply
that
he
knew
that
omar
taylor
was
involved
in
the
robbery
of
moseley's
grocery
store.
that
is
it.
nothing
further
to
indicate
any
amount
of
credibility.
dunaway
falls
very
close
to
this
case
in
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
on
which
to
substantiate
the
testimony
or
the
statement
made
by
the
alleged
individual
incarcerated.
one
thing
i
want
to
point
out.
now,
a
lot
of
the
justices
on
their
dissents--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--right.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
well,
if
there's
probable
cause--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--it
wasn't
until
respondent's
brief
came
in.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
no.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
well,
i
know
that
he
is
going
to
argue
that.
i'll
move
along.
assuming
that
there
is
no
probable
cause,
then
we
come
to
the
point
in
fact
of
the
arrest.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
all
right.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
aguilar
and
spinelli.
there's
also
an
alabama
case
which
i
argued
originally,
berry.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
i
understand.
but
under
aguilar
and
under
the
petition
filed
by
the
defendant,
he
states
clearly
that
aguilar
and
spinelli
are
involved
here.
and
on
brief
by
the
amicus
curiae
raised
this
also.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
they
spell
out
the
necessary
basis
for
the
credibility
of
the
informant.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
you
don't
even
have
that
here.
i
understand
that.
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
your
honor.
now,
omar
taylor
was
arrested
following
this
information,
without
a
warrant,
which
makes
it
different
from
dunaway
in
that
in
dunaway
the
justices,
i
believe
mr.
burger,
chief
justice
burger,
indicated
that,
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
this
wasn't
a
consent
to
follow
the
police
officer
to
the
station.
we
certainly
don't
have
that
issue
in
the
present
case.
we
have
no
issue...
there's
no
question
but
that
he
was
arrested
at
the
time
he
was
taken
into
custody
by
the
police.
in
fact,
he
was
handcuffed.
now
we
come
to
the
question
under
dunaway
and
under
brown.
there
are
three
temporal...
i
mean,
there
are
three
circumstances
which
the
court
would
look
to.
certainly,
the
temporal
proximity
is
involved,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
in
dunaway
indicated
that
that
is
an
ambiguous
term
in
that
certainly
the
longer
an
individual
is
incarcerated,
considering
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
his
incarceration
can
not...
will
not
necessarily
dilute
the
detention,
but
will
only
increase
the
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
incarcerated
individual.
i
think
it's
clear
here
that
the
defendant
was...
or
the
petitioner
was
questioned
at
least
three
times,
perhaps
four;
that
he
was
fingerprinted
prior
to
being
placed
in
a
lineup.
now,
it's
interesting
in
discussing
the
fingerprinting
that
you
ruled
in
davis
v.
mississippi
that
under
narrowly
defined
circumstances
perhaps
the
limits
of
probable
cause
can
be
removed
to
some
extent.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
after
the
arrest.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
he
was
not...
he
was
indeed...
yes,
he
was
indeed
fingerprinted.
at
the
trial
he
was
fingerprinted.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
they
were
excluded.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
under
mississippi
versus
davis.
and
under
mississippi--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
well,
quite
frankly--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--that's
what
they
ruled.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
no,
they
indicate
that.
they
indicated
that
the
taint
had
been
removed.
actually,
what
the
alabama--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--they
did
not.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
it's
interesting
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
basically
said
in
its
opinion
that
they
were
rather
discouraged
by
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
that
they
were
just,
quite
frankly,
not
going
to
follow
it.
that
is
basically
what
they
said,
because
they
did
not
delineate
the
reasons
upon
which
they
reversed
the
case.
they
did
not
delineate
the
factors
on
which
they
overturned
the
case.
going
a
little
bit
further
now,
it's
interesting
in
the
fact
that
in
davis
you
all
indicated
that
perhaps
there
will
be
a
case
in
which
the
fingerprints
on
less
than
probable
cause
can
be
permitted.
but
this
case
is
not
the
one,
because
the
individual
was
fingerprinted
twice,
he
was
questioned
on
at
least...
at
least
questioned
during
that
period
of
time.
in
other
words,
they
did
not
arrest
him
or
pick
him
up
specifically
to
get
the
fingerprints
and
then
match
them
up.
i
cited
in
my
brief
m.b.
v.
state
of
new
jersey,
a
new
jersey
case,
in
re
the
fingerprinting
of
m.b.,
which
seemed
to
fall
within
the
confines
of
what
you
all
consider
reasonable
under
davis.
in
other
words,
they
went
to
a
magistrate
and
indicated
that
we
have
the
possibility
of
determining
the
murderer
of
an
eighth
grade
child,
because
we
found
a
ring
which
has
fingerprint
on
it.
we
believe
that
the
culprit
in
this
situation
may
match
this
and
is
probably
a
member
of
that
eighth
grade
class.
and
the
court
in
that
case
went
ahead
and
said,
we
will
allow
you,
we
will
allow
you
to
bring
in
the
members
of
the
eighth
grade
class
and
fingerprint
them.
but
in
order
to
protect
their
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment,
should
you
not
find
that
those
fingerprints
match
they
must
be
destroyed,
so
that
they
will
not
be
on
record,
so
that
they
will
not
interfere
with
the
normal
constitutional
rights
of
the
individual.
and
i
think
that's
very
important
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
important
that
the
police
officers
did
not
stop
with
the
fingerprinting.
and
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
that
they
picked
him
up
specifically
to
fingerprint
him.
there's
no
indication
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
well,
i'll
explain
something
to
you,
that
it's
so
important.
in
dunaway
you
all
talk
about
the
flagrancy,
purpose
and
flagrancy
of
the
police
conduct,
all
right.
you
discuss
the
fact
that
when
the
police
conduct
is
excessively
flagrant
the
intervening
circumstances
perhaps
should
be
more
credible.
a
stronger
intervening
circumstance,
the
more
flagrant
the
police
conduct,
the
more
you
have
to
look
at
the...
i
mean,
of
the
flagrant
procedures
used
by
the
police.
now,
assuming
again
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
whatsoever
and
that
this...
well,
i
submit
that
this
was
strictly
for
the
purposes
of
investigation.
you've
got
to
look
at
what
they
did.
they
picked
this
young
man
up--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--i
believe
it
falls
within
the
dunaway
line.
i
believe
it
falls
in
the
dunaway
line.
fingerprints
fall
under
the
davis
line--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--excuse
me?
mr.
robert
m.
beno
well,
it's
my
contention
that
it
was
one
and
the
same.
it
came
out,
the
issue
is
the
same.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
let's
look
at
this,
then.
what
are
we...
how
did
he
get
in
the
court?
how
did
he
get
in
the
court?
if
this
court
can
say...
let's
look
at,
what
evidence
did
they
have
prior
to
the
arrest?
nothing.
what
evidence
did
they
have
when
they
took
the
fingerprints?
none.
from
that
point,
what
did
they
use
to
get
the
confession?
they
used
the
fingerprints.
the
record
is
replete,
is
full
of
evidence
that
he
was
confronted
with
the
fingerprints
over
and
over
again.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
they
suppressed
the
fingerprints.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
the
first
fingerprints.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
under
dunaway,
yes,
was
not
could
not
come
within
the
purview
of
the--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
there
is
a--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--there
is
another
brief
that
was
filed,
a
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
it
was
filed.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
well,
and
we
filed
a
motion.
let
me
explain
what
happened
on
that.
we
filed
that
motion--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--we
filed
that
motion
on
time--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
if
you
will
look
at
the
appendix,
you
will
notice
that
the
appendix
indicates
the
facts
involved
in
the
case.
all
i
did
was
cite
the
case
and
the
law
as
it
applied
to
the
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
i
did
in
fact
look
at
the
rules.
at
any
rate,
after
the
fingerprints
were
taken
the
girlfriend
was
taken
to
the...
the
individual
was
taken
into
a...
for
a
lineup,
prepared
for
a
lineup.
the
lineup
was
taken
subsequent
to
the
fingerprints
and
prior
to
any
judicial
finding
in
this
case.
now,
under
johnson
v.
louisiana,
as
cited
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
he
tries
to
indicate
under
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
they
seem
to
indicate
that
the...
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
justice
marshall
for
a
second.
the
indication
to
me
was,
from
the
clerk's
office,
was
that
there
could
be
full
and
complete
going...
i
could
go
to
the
record
in
my
argument
throughout.
and
then
they
indicated
to
me
they
wanted
the
brief
to
be
as
short
as
possible.
at
any
rate,
there's
no
question
in
this
case
but
that
there
were
an
illegal
arrest,
three
cases
of,
or
four
cases
of
questioning,
illegal
fingerprints
were
taken;
he
was
confronted
by
his
girlfriend
at
the
time
just
prior
to
the
confession;
that
at
that
time
the
police
officers
came
in
and
discussed
the
case
in
front
of
the
girlfriend
and
petitioner,
and
indicated
to
him
at
that
time
and
to
her
that
he
was
facing
30
years
in
the
penitentiary,
that
he
had
nothing
left
to
hide,
that
they
had
the
fingerprints
and
that
they
would
stand
up
in
any
court.
it
is
my
position
that
in
reference
to
the
same,
that
the
flagrancy
of
the
police
conduct,
which
appears
to
be
under
dunaway
what
you
all
were
looking
at,
mainly
because
of
temporal
proximity
can
be
ambiguous.
but
the
flagrancy
in
this
case
is
that
the
police
had
two
weeks
between
the
time
they
got
this
information
and
the
time
they
went
and
got
and
picked
up
the
defendant
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause.
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances
in
which
to
determine
that
they
can
go
out
and
pick
up
this
individual.
they
had
plenty
of
time
to
go
before
a
magistrate
and
ask
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
i
agree,
i
agree.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
no,
it
would
not
have,
not
in
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
point
out
that...
and
maybe
i
should
hold
this
for
response...
that
the
petitioner...
or
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
going
to
argue
that
there
may
have
been
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
maybe
there
was.
i
would
submit
there
certainly
was
not.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
this
time
for
response.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent's
statement
to
you
in
reference
to
the
facts
in
this
case
certainly
finds
no
support
in
the
record.
he
indicates
that
charles
martin
was
a
suspect
in
the
crime.
there
is
no
factual
evidence
from
the
record
to
indicate
on
what
basis
he
finds
that
conclusion.
he
tries
to
change
the
events
which
occurred
at
the
police
station
and
give
you
some
indication
that
the
continuous
questioning
and
police
investigation
on
this
crime
took
place
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
the
defendant
was
arrested
at
3:00
o'clock,
that
from
that
point
until
he
got
to
the
police
station,
although
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony,
that
he
was
at
least
questioned
by
the
police
officer
in
the
car;
that
he
was
questioned
prior
to
his
fingerprints
being
taken;
that
he
was
placed
in
a
lineup
prior
to
a
warrant
being
issued;
that
he
was
again
questioned.
and
it's
clear
on
the
record
that
a
detective
wilson...
and
this
was
without
rebuttal
by
the
state...
that
a
detective
wilson
threatened
to
shove
his
head
through
the
wall
if
he
did
confess.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
i
understand,
but
i
think
it's
clear
that--
mr.
robert
m.
beno
--but
i'm
pointing
out,
we're
now
looking
at
the
flagrancy
of
the
police
conduct.
now,
that's
certainly
a
consideration
of
dunaway.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
but
we're
talking
about
the
flagrancy
of
the
police
conduct
and
the
purposefulness
from
which
the
arrest
was
made.
it
seemed
almost
impossible
in
my
mind
that
respondent
can
argue
a
good
faith
action
on
the
part
of
the
police.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
if
there's
no
illegal
arrest,
we
have
no
grounds
for
being
up
here.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
that's
correct.
that's
how
they
proceeded
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
i
understand.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
they
had
this
information
in
front
of
them
for
a
period
of
over
a
week,
your
honor,
over
a
week
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
this
arrest.
mr.
robert
m.
beno
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
but
certainly
you're
not
going
to...
it's
not
going
to
be
contended
that
because
of
the
number
of
cases
on
the
police
blotter
that
a
police
group
can
go
out,
even
when
there
is
time,
in
fact
time
to
go
to
a
magistrate
or
at
least
contact
a
district
attorney
or
something
of
that
nature
to
determine
whether
or
not,
based
on
the
bald
statement
of
an
alleged
rapist
and
robber,
that
you
can
go
out
and
make
an
arrest.
i
don't
think
this
court
is
going
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
if
this
was
a
case
where
after
the
information
came
in
to
him
he
had
immediately
gone
out
based
on
that
and
in
good
faith
made
an
arrest,
that
might
have
been
a
situation
where
it
was
simply
a
mistake.
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
simply
a
mistake.
this
is
a
case
where
the
police
obviously
knew
that
they
did
not
have
probable
cause,
that
they
had
time
to
make
a
determination...
have
a
determination
made
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause,
that
the
only
purpose
that
the
defendant
was
picked
up
in
this
case
was
in
order
to
find
out
whether
or
not
they
could,
through
their
flagrant
and
purposeful
measures,
whether
or
not
they
could
bring
in
certain
evidence
during
the
detentionary
period
on
which
to
hold
the
defendant.
that
is
certainly
the
only
fact
before
you
in
this
case.
if
this
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
police
can
purposefully
and
when
knowing
they
have
no
probable
cause
go
out
and
pick
up
an
individual
in
order
to
determine
through
investigation
of
that
defendant's
condition
at
the
police
station
whether
or
not
they
have
a
case
against
the
defendant,
then
we're
in
a
situation
where
the
exclusionary
rule
no
longer
serves
a
deterrent
purpose.
certainly
the
medication
served
by
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
a
pleasant
one.
but
the
interest
of
society
in
protecting
them
from
abusive
conduct
and
extraordinary
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
police
must
be
balanced
against
the
need
to
protect
society.
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
officers
in
this
case
acted
in
any
other
way
than
flagrantly.
and
the
time
period
involved
certainly
does
not
take
this
case
out
of
dunaway.
thank
you.
