mr.
richard
a.
dudden
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
bring
before
you
this
morning
a
constitutional
law
question
involving
the
commerce
clause.
nebraska's
law
prohibits
the
transportation
of
water
into
another
state
unless
that
state
has
reciprocal
legislation.
colorado
has
no
reciprocal
legislation.
in
1971
the
nebraska
department
of
water
resources
issued
a
well
registration
number
for
the
well
that
is
in
question
today.
this
registration
filing
noted
on
its
face
that
the
land
in
colorado
was
to
be
irrigated.
the
well
was
then
used
by
the
appellants'
predecessors
to
irrigate
the
agricultural
land
in
nebraska.
but
later
on
in
1971,
the
appellants
purchased
this
land
from
their
predecessors
and
renewed
their
intentions
to
irrigate
the
colorado
land.
they
obtained
approval
to
proceed
from
the
manager
of
the
local
water
management
district.
this
approval
included
the
conveyance
of
water
by
pipeline
from
the
well
located
in
nebraska
to
the
appellants'
adjacent
land
in
colorado.
the
well
itself
is
located
only
a
few
feet
from
the
colorado
state
line.
if
you
were
to
look
on
page
112
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
is
a
map
that
would
show
you
the
location
of
the
real
estate
involved
and
the
proximity
of
the
well
to
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
the
well
is
approximately
300
feet
deep,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
mr.
justice
white,
the--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--it
is
in
the
record,
but
i
can
answer
that
question.
he
expended
approximately
$45,000
for
the
installation
of
the
underground
pipe
and
the
installation
of
the
pivot
sprinkler
irrigation
equipment.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
he
would,
your
honor,
because
when
you
use
a
pivot
sprinkler
irrigation
system
you
pipe
approximately
1300
feet
to
the
center
of
the
field.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
into
nebraska?
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
your
honor.
colorado
has
an
absolute
prohibition
from
transporting
water
into
nebraska.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
no,
i
do
not.
the
land
upon
which
the
water--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--if
the
appellant
had
a
permit
in
nebraska--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--no,
they
could
not,
because
colorado
does
not
have
a
reciprocity
statute
today--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--to
allow
water
to
be
transported
from
colorado
into
nebraska.
that's
the
crux
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
it
is.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
i
think
we
have,
your
honor.
i
haven't
in
my
oral
argument.
however,
we
are
relying
on
the
mining
act,
the
desert
land
act,
and
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
it
is
our
position
that
none
of
those
acts
direct
attention
to
water.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
no,
we
do
not
have
that
in
our
brief
in
chief,
your
honor,
and
we
did
not
prepare
a
reply
brief,
in
view
of
the
number
of
briefs
that
had
been
submitted
covering
the
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
it
would
be.
but
congress
has
not
done
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
i
am.
the
land
upon
which
the
water
is
to
be
used
from
the
nebraska
well
is
immediately
adjacent
to
and
contiguous
with
the
nebraska
land,
as
you
will
note
on
the
map.
only
a
small
gravel
road...
and
it's
not
a
highway...
separates
these
tracts.
based
upon
the
approval
by
the
district,
the
appellant
invested
a
large
sum
of
money,
approximately
$45,000,
to
install
the
underground
pipelines
and
irrigation
equipment,
and
commenced
irrigating
the
140-acre
tract
located
in
colorado.
in
1976,
the
nebraska
department
of
water
resources
issued
a
letter
to
the
appellants
ordering
them
to
cease
transporting
water
from
nebraska
into
colorado.
suit
was
brought
by
nebraska
against
the
appellants
in
the
state
court
to
enjoin
them
from
irrigating
the
colorado
land
from
the
nebraska
well.
at
that
point
in
time
the
appellants
argued
that
the
law,
the
nebraska
law,
was
unconstitutional
and
was
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
however,
affirmed
the
state
court's
injunction
and
held
the
law
constitutional,
including
the
mandatory
reciprocity
requirements
which
were
included
in
the
nebraska
statutes.
however,
in
that
opinion
nebraska's
chief
justice
krivosha
vigorously
dissented
on
the
reciprocity
issue.
this
appeal
followed.
nebraska
held
that
water
is
not
an
article
of
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore
the
court
concluded
that
the
commerce
clause
did
not
apply
to
the
reciprocity
requirement.
the
question
before
this
court
today
is
whether
water
is
a
subject
of
commerce
clause
standards.
we
know
if
this
were
any
other
natural
resource
the
nebraska
statute
requiring
reciprocity
would
be
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause.
this
court
in
the
great
atlantic
&
pacific
tea
company
case
said
that
a
state
cannot
discriminate
or
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce
and
that
a
mandatory
reciprocity
clause
or
requirement
is
unconstitutional.
the
question,
then,
is
whether
water
is
different
from
all
other
resources
for
commerce
clause
purposes.
nebraska
argues
that
water
is
unique
and
should
be
exempted
from
commerce
clause
standards,
and
they
argued
this
for
three
reasons:
first,
nebraska
has
defined
water
under
its
state
law
as
being
publicly
owned.
we
acknowledge
that
in
nebraska
water
is
publicly
owned
and
that
nebraska
is
the
public
trustee
of
that
water.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
your
honor,
in
nebraska
the
constitution
declares
that
water
is
publicly
owned
by
the
state
and
that
the
state
is
the
trustee
of
that
water
for
its...
for
persons,
cities,
municipalities,
corporations,
and
any
other
entity.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
my
understanding
or
my
feeling
is,
your
honor,
that
nebraska
believes
that
water
is
publicly
owned
at
all
points
in
time,
not
when
it
is
converted
to
use
and
not
when
it
is
converted,
for
example,
to
personal
property,
such
as
being
drawn
from
a
well;
that
any
water
in
the
state,
regardless
of
where
it
is
located,
is
publicly
owned
by
the
state.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
no,
that
is
not...
we
do
not
have
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
no.
the
publicly
owned
philosophy,
justice
white,
as
i
understand
it,
would
be
acting
as
a
public
trustee
for
persons
who
desire
to
withdraw
the
water
and
put
it
to
a
beneficial
use.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
and
we
acknowledge
that
public
trustee
ownership.
and
as
long
as
a
person,
any
person,
desires
to
withdraw
water
in
nebraska,
they
may
do
so
upon
applying
for
permission.
the
court
in
the
hughes
versus
oklahoma
case,
this
court,
held
that
a
declaration
of
public
ownership,
such
as
has
been
done
in
nebraska,
is
a
mere
fiction
and
makes
no
difference
for
commerce
clause
purposes.
in
the
oklahoma
case,
oklahoma
claimed
public
ownership
of
natural
minerals
much
in
the
same
way
that
nebraska
is
now
attempting
to
claim
public
ownership
of
water.
both
in
nebraska
and
oklahoma,
that
claimed
ownership
is
regulatory
in
nature
and
is
not
proprietary
or
commercial.
since
nebraska
is
acting
as
a
market
regulator
and
not
as
a
market
participant,
it
is
our
position
that
nebraska
cannot
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
because
nebraska
feels
this
way,
they
have
presented
three
arguments.
the
second
argument
is
that
water
is
different
because
congress
by
federal
act
has
authorized
the
western
states
to
restrict
interstate
transportation
of
water.
while
congress
may
enact
such
legislation,
it
is
our
position
that
it
must
do
so
in
clear
and
unmistakable
language.
congress
has
not
acted
in
clear
and
unmistakable
language
with
regard
to
this
subject.
nebraska
has
relied
for
its
basic
references
in
connection
with
the
federal
laws
on
the
mining
act
of
1866,
the
desert
land
act
of
1877,
and
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
alleging
that
these
acts
constitute
authorizations
for
the
states
to
prohibit
or
restrict
the
interstate
transportation
of
water.
however,
none
of
these
acts
contain
what
this
court
has
said,
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
to
the
states
to
burden
interstate
commerce.
they
have...
none
of
these
acts
contain
that
power.
in
the
mining
act
congress
opened
up
mineral
lands
for
use
and
development
by
citizens
and
confirmed
the
vested
water
rights.
in
the
desert
land
act
they
opened
up
desert
lands
for
development
by
citizens
and
confirmed
vested
water
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
case
and
the
case
of
california
versus
the
united
states
basically
concluded
that
in
operating
under
those
acts
they
must
recognize
the
state
water
laws.
but
they
did
not
say
that
the
states
had
the
power
to
preclude
under
interstate
commerce.
it
was
directed
to
a
joining
of
hands
on
those
acts
with
the
then
current
state
laws.
and
in
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
congress
provided
for
the
sale
of
public
lands,
the
proceeds
of
which
were
to
be
used
to
fund
the
creation
of
irrigation
projects.
therefore,
while
we
agree
that
congress
could
authorize
the
states
to
prohibit
water
exports,
much
as
they
exempted
the
insurance
industry
under
the
mccarran
amendment,
it
is
clear
that
none
of
the
acts
cited
by
nebraska
exempt
water
from
commerce.
finally,
nebraska
argues
that
water
is
physically
unique.
however,
a
western
water
law
specialist,
professor
corker,
would
disagree
with
that
theory.
professor
corker
has
written
that
water,
from
whatever
source,
is
not
economically
different
from
other
resources.
he
points
out
that
a
beneficial
exchange
of
goods
is
a
motivating
force
in
trade
and
commerce
and
concludes
that
this
free
market
motivation
should
be
equally
potent
when
one
of
the
commodities
is
water
and--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
well,
i
don't...
nebraska
has
taken
the
position
that
they
can
preclude
the
transportation
of
water
across
state
lines
by
requiring
other
states
to
have
reciprocal
statutes.
we
don't
argue
that
nebraska
should
not...
that
nebraska
does
not
have
the
power
to
control
water.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
control
water
to
the
extent
that
they
can
restrict
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
i
think
it
would
depend,
justice
rehnquist,
on
how
nebraska
worded
their
law
with
regard
to
the
preclusion
to
transport
it
across
state
lines.
in
this
particular
instance,
they
are
requiring
the
neighboring
state
to
have
a
reciprocity
clause
in
their
law
in
order
to
allow
that
water
to
be
transported.
in
other
words--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--in
other
words,
their
tests
are
reasonable
use,
waste
and
private
welfare
for
the
state
of
nebraska.
and
then
they
add,
and
in
addition,
you
may
not
transport
water
into
another
state
unless
that
state
reciprocates
with
nebraska.
we're
contending
that
that
is
one
step
too
far,
and
that
in-state
water
users
should
be
afforded
the
same
equal
treatment
as
out-state
water
users
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
well,
we
are...
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
how
to
interpret
the
word
"rely",
what
you
mean
by
the
word
"rely".
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
nebraska
law
requires
reciprocity.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
and
without
relying
on
that,
without
that
statute
being
in
or
of
record
in
nebraska,
the
appellant
in
this
instance
would
be
eligible
for
a
permit
to
use
water
in
colorado.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
i
think
that
an
absolute
prohibition
of
the
interstate
transportation
of
water
and
the
nebraska
statute
are
identical
today.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
i
would.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
no,
their
basic
foundational
law
is
different
in
terms
of
ownership.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
they
do
not
consider
themselves
to
be
public
trustees
of
the
water.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
similar,
similar...
not
the
texas
law.
no,
not
the
texas
law.
the
texas
law
is
the
old
english
law,
which
is
absolute
ownership.
and
if
you're
talking
about
the
aldus
case,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--no,
colorado's
law
is
a
modified
law
and
is
a
modified
american
law.
you
have--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--no,
we
have
not
attacked
the
colorado
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
was
it?
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
it
is
not,
no.
the
nebraska
statute
is
interfering
with
the
appellants'
rights
to
water.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
for
money.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
i
believe
they
could
be.
however,
in
most
instances,
your
honor,
the
transfer
of
water
for
money
is
involved
in
the
price
of
the
land.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
the
farmer
is
buying
the
right
to
irrigate.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
they
are.
and
your
honor--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--generally
not.
generally,
it's
a
very
simple
regulatory
procedure.
a
person
owning
a
piece
of
land
with
a
water
registration
simply
makes
a
written
request
to
the
nebraska
department
of
water
resources
and
instructs
them
to
transfer
it
to
the
next
person.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
no,
none
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
today,
my
client
today?
if
it
were
in
colorado--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--in
nebraska?
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
he
could
do
that,
your
honor,
but
the
water
registration
specifically
provides
for
the
water
to
be
used
on
agricultural
land.
they
call
it
overlying
agricultural
land.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
he
could.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
in
nebraska.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
nebraska
has...
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
approved
the
commercial
sale
of
water
for
drinking
purposes
the
metropolitan
water
district
case.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
i
felt
that
it
did,
your
honor,
yes.
that's
our
position.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
the
statute
itself
does
not
provide
for
a
limitation.
there
is
a
lot
of
activity
with
regard
to
inter-transportation
between
basins
at
the
present
time,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
they
are
taking
positions.
they
are
just
starting
to
take
positions.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
from
one
watershed
to
another,
yes.
but
that--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
not
at
the
present
times,
no.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
they
do,
justice
o'connor.
interstate
compacts,
however,
are
for
purposes
of
states
agreeing
to
use
water
from
one
state
and
move
it
into
another.
we
have
just
such
an
impact...
just
such
a
compact,
called
the
platte
river
compact,
in
this
area,
where
the
state
of
nebraska
and
the
state
of
colorado
joined
together
and
agreed
to
allow
water
to
be
withdrawn
from
the
platte
river
in
colorado
and
transported
by
canal
into
nebraska.
this
was
approved
by
congress.
it's
our
position
that
these
compacts
do
not
in
any
case,
in
any
specific
instance,
represent
a
specific,
clear
language
by
the
congress
to
remove
water
from
interstate
commerce.
they
simply
are
agreements
or
contracts
between
the
states
to
help
the
states
transport
water
back
and
forth
among
themselves,
actually
contrary
to
our
position,
because
here
nebraska
is
attempting
to
keep
water
from
being
transported
from
colorado
into
nebraska,
when
the
compacts
generally
are
to
allow
water
to
go
from
one
state
to
another
by
state
agreement.
it
is
our
position
that
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
is
to
encourage
a
national
market
for
all
resources
and
to
encourage
maximum
economic
efficiency
in
the
use
of
these
resources.
the
mandatory
reciprocity
clause
in
the
nebraska
law
is
hostile
to
this
area
and
idea.
reciprocity
is
not
necessary
to
remove
other
states'
embargoes,
because
the
commerce
clause
by
itself
creates
the
necessary
reciprocity.
furthermore,
our
chief
justice
has
said,
in
the
opinion
of
the
sporhase
case
that
reciprocity
is
unnecessary
to
carry
out
nebraska's
conservation
goals.
the
reciprocity
of
the
nebraska
statute
has
no
connection
to
the
need
or
availability
of
water,
and
it
is
clear
that
the
remaining
part
of
nebraska's
law
would
be
adequate
without
the
reciprocity
provisions,
as
it
already
provides
for
reasonable
uses,
conservation
and
concern
for
public
welfare.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes,
it
is.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
well
was
not
in
a
critical
township
or
critical
area
at
the
time
that
it
was
approved
and
drilled.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
and
that
the
withdrawal
from
that
well
has
always
been
used
in
all
calculations
by
the
district
and
by
the
state
in
connection
with
withdrawals
of
water
in
that
area.
to
allow
our
client
to
continue
to
use
this
well
for
the
purpose
which
he
is
doing
today
would
make
no
difference
on
the
use
or
public
welfare
off
the
state
of
nebraska.
it's
our
position
that
we
don't
need
to
have
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
or
interstate
uses
of
water
and
there
is
no
justification
for
it.
what
our
appellant
asks
of
this
court
is
that
the
commerce
clause
is
exactly
what
the
commerce
clause
provides,
and
that
would
be
that
in-state
water
users
and
out
of
state
water
users
be
afforded
equal
treatment.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
your
honor,
there
are...
i
don't
think
that's
a
problem,
and
the
reason
i
don't
is--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--that
would
be
a
serious
problem
if
people
were
able
to--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--i
don't
believe
the
state
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
i
find
it
difficult
to
conceive
of
an
emergency,
chief
justice
burger,
that
would
warrant
that
use
of--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--as
a
conservation
matter?
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
yes.
the
states
today
have
the--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--i
think
each
situation,
of
course,
would
have
to
be
very
carefully
reviewed
on
its
own
independent
facts.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
well,
i
think
that
each
state
has--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--well,
i
think
that
each
state
has
current
law
that
allows
them
to
review
each
individual
application
and
determine
whether
or
not
those
uses
proposed
meet
the
current
statutes.
we
don't
need
a
prohibition
of
transporting
water
from
one
state
to
another
to
protect
the
states
today
and
to
protect
their
water
and
the
citizens'
water.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
i
think
congress
by
statute
could
specifically
say
in
clear
language
that
each
state
has
the
right
to--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--no,
i
do
not.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
i
do
not
think
congress
has
that
power.
but
i
believe
congress
has
the
power
to
allow
the
states
to
control
water
themselves
and
take
water
out
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
as
long
as
their
statutes
do
not
interfere
with
the
interstate
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
they
might
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
it
could
not.
but
they
could
give
the
power
to
the
states
to
remove
water
from
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
your
honors,
that
concludes
my
argument.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
if
this
mandatory
reciprocity
requirement
were
eliminated
that
there
still
would
remain
on
the
books
and
records
of
the
nebraska
statutes
adequate
law
to
allow
the
state
of
nebraska
to
evenhandedly
control
and
regulate
water.
they
would
do
this
by
determining
reasonable
uses
and
setting
forth
those
reasonable
uses,
so
that
people
could
calculate
whether
or
not
they
were
making
reasonable
use
of
the
water,
by
conducting
administrative
hearings
and
by
issuing
well
permits
specifically
restricting
the
use
of
water
as
to
the
particular
purpose
requested.
they
do
not
need
to
have
a
mandatory
reciprocal
requirement
in
order
to
control
water
in
nebraska.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
case
in
the
state
of
nebraska
that
specifically
defines
overlying
land,
and
that
has
been
discussed
quite
a
bit
this
morning.
i
would
also
like
to
mention
that
it
is
our
opinion
that
congress
does
have
the
power
to
regulate
concerning
water,
as
has
been
asked
by
this
court.
but
the
question
that's
really
before
the
court
today
is:
what
is
the
law
under
the
commerce
clause
when
congress
has
not
clearly
and
unmistakeably
legislated
on
the
question?
it
is
our
position
that,
in
view
of
all
of
the
acts
that
have
been
mentioned
in
counsel's
opposing
brief
by
the
state
of
nebraska,
none
of
those
acts
use
clear
and
unmistakeable
language--
mr.
richard
a.
dudden
--that
is
correct.
and
i'm
saying
further,
they
have
not
done
so.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
