mr.
george
roderic
anderson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
we
go
too
far
in
the
argument,
i
think
counsel
both
agree
on
what
issue
we're
discussing
today,
whether
the
commerce
clause
applies
to
natural...
to
water
as
a
natural
resource.
i
think
before
we
get
too
far
into
that,
that
i
would
like
to,
in
light
of
appellants'
remarks,
address
specifically
some
areas
of
nebraska
law
that
have
been
discussed
in
your
questioning
of
appellant
here
today.
i
would
like
to
clear
some
things
up.
in
answer
to
some
questions
directed
by
justice
white,
appellant
was
saying
that...
appellants'
counsel
was
saying
that
water
rights
may
be
transferred
and
severed
from
the
land
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
now,
as
we
read
the
sporhase
decision
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
which
is...
which
is
printed
in
the
appendix,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
119
of
that
appendix...
our
court
spoke
upon
its
feelings
on
that,
and
it
said:
"neither
the
courts
nor
the
legislature
of
nebraska
have
considered
nebraska
ground
water
as
an
article
of
commerce.
"
"free
transfer
and
exchange
of
ground
water
in
a
market
setting
have
never
been
permitted
in
this
state,
since
the
water
itself
is
publicly
owned.
"
"the
public,
through
legislative
action,
may
grant
to
private
persons
the
right
to
the
use
of
public-owned
waters
for
private
purposes.
"
--irrigation
or
drinking;
that's
my
parens...
"but
as
the
olson
opinion
demonstrates
with
its
emphasis
on
sharing
in
times
of
shortage,
the
public
may
limit
or
deny
the
right
of
private
parties
to
freely
use
the
water
when
it
determines
that
the
welfare
of
the
state
and
its
citizens
is
at
stake.
"
"even
where
it
appears
that
water
itself
is
being
marketed,
as
in
municipal
water
supply
arrangements,
it
is
the
value
of
the
cost
of
distributing
the
water
that
is
the
basis
of
rate
structure
and
not
the
value
of
the
water
itself.
"
appellant
recognizes
in
its
brief
at
page
13
that
water
used
for
irrigation,
agricultural
irrigation,
must
be
applied
to
the
overlying
land.
that's
the
overlying
land
of
the
ground
water
from
which
it
is
pumped.
that
means
under
nebraska
law,
as
it
is
understood
by
the
attorney
general
of
that
state
and
by
those
who
apply
those
statutes
in
nebraska,
that
water
may
not
be
transferred.
it
may
not
be
severed
from
the
land.
it
is
not
and
cannot
be
sold.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
there
is
no
doubt...
that
specific
question
has
never
arisen,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
water
is...
can
be
used
for
drinking,
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
water
can
be
used
for
consumption
in
agriculture,
in
any
sort
of
function.
however,
water
itself
cannot
be
severed
from
the
land.
it
is
not...
a
water
right
is
not
a
separate
title.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
your
honor,
if
someone
is
selling
water
in
nebraska,
which
i
do
not
know
about,
they...
it
would
be
an
article
of
commerce
at
that
point,
just,
your
honor,
as
water
can
be
an
article
of
commerce
in
texas,
i
suppose,
once
it's
possessed.
but
water,
agricultural
water,
irrigation
water,
is
not
subject
to
private
ownership.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
under
nebraska
law.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
irrigation
water
generally...
now,
irrigation
water,
there
is...
storage
water
is...
you're
paying
for
the
transfer
of
the
water,
that's
right.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
i'm
speaking
of--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--that's
correct.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
farmers
have
individual
water
rights
for
the
natural
flow
of
that
water,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that's
correct,
and
then
cast
it
off.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
a
right
of
appropriation,
your
honor.
and
that
right
of
appropriation
cannot
be
transferred
from
that
land.
if
you
do
not
use
that
appropriation
on
that
land
for
three
consecutive
years,
that
appropriation
is
subject
to
cancellation.
it
ceases.
it
cannot
be
used
to
transfer
to
some
other
land.
it
cannot
be
used
to
transfer
to
your
brother-in-law
or
to
sell
to
someone
else
for
a
profit,
for
any
money.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
your
honor,
it
is
part
of
the
land.
it
carries
no
value
separate
from
the
land.
the
land
will...
the
value
of
the
land
will
vary
depending
upon
such
things
as
the--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--just
as
it
will
vary,
your
honor...
that's
correct.
well--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--no.
but
your
honor,
it'll
vary
depending
on
whether
you
have
an
aquifer
below
it
and
whether
you
have
you...
whether
it
can
grow
the
crop
that
you
want,
whether
it's
adjacent
to
a
city
or
metropolitan
area,
what
the
type
of
soil
is,
whether
it's
rolling
or
non-rolling.
none
of
those
can
be
severed
from
the
land,
just
as
water
cannot.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
well,
that's
not
necessarily
so,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
well,
that's
true.
i
don't
know
of
any
particular
case
which
has
defined--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--he
owns--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--i
can't
tell
you
exactly.
he
owns
some
contiguous
land,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
contest,
there
has
been
no
contest,
of
his--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--oh,
closer
than
some,
some
land
is
closer,
that's
correct.
but
your
honor,
we
must
recognize
that
water
is--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
you
can't
say
it's
overlying
when
you
have
a
state
boundary
between
them.
you
can't...
this
is
a
recognized
boundary
between
tracts
of
land.
it
is
a
legally
recognized
boundary,
and
water,
your
honor--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--well,
i
didn't
say
that
2,000
feet
from
the
well
would
necessarily
be
overlying,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
water
is
treated
as
being
allocated
to
states,
and
states
are
the
unit
by
which
water
is
apportioned.
this
court
has
apportioned
water
to
states
in
their
equitable
apportionment
decrees
and
judgments.
the
various
states
and
congress
have
negotiated
and
approved
interstate
compacts
which
have
apportioned
and
allocated
water
between
the
states.
both
of
these
approaches
have
conceived
of
water
as
being
treated,
as
being
subject
to
the
complete
control
and
management
and
regulation
by
the
states
of
this
water.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that
would
not,
your
honor.
the
question
really
arises
because
the
question--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--the
interstate
compact
is
of
two
relevances,
your
honor.
one
is
that
it
shows
that
the
state
is
treated
as
the
unit
which
manages
the
water,
number
one,
and
that
a
state
boundary
has
a
meaning
in
water
law,
as
in
law
over
water
as
a
natural
resource.
number
two,
it
shows
congress'
deference,
or
exemption,
if
you
will,
to
the
states
to
the
management
of
water
resources.
water
is
different
than
other
natural
resources.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
in
nebraska,
you
mean?
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
we
have...
if
i
understand
your
question,
we
have
two
farms.
one--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--no,
your
honor,
he
cannot.
he
must
drill
his
own
well
or
he
must
appropriate
water
from
a
water
source,
a
stream,
if
he
has
access
to
that.
or
if
he
is
on
an
irrigation
canal--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--your
honor
he
doesn't--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--your
honor,
we
have
such
a
thing
as
irrigation
districts,
and
people
who
don't
have
water
underlying
their
land...
we
have
two
types
of
water,
your
honor,
underground
water,
what
we
call
ground
water--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--surface
water.
he
would
then,
if
he
has
no
source
of
underground
water,
if
there's
no
sufficient
aquifer
there...
and
there
is
land
like
that...
we
have
a
predominant
situation--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--no.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
no,
your
honor,
not
ground
water.
his
remedy
is
surface
water.
and
that's...
this
is
nebraska
water
law,
that
a
person...
that
the
overlying
land
owner--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--pardon
me?
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
okay.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
then,
your
honor,
there's
such
a
thing
in
nebraska--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--it's
dry
land
farming,
just
as
the
appellant
is
doing
with
the
land
in
this
case.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
if
he
owned...
if
one
man
owned
two
tracts
of
land,
then
there
would
be
some
leeway
to
pumping
the
water.
i
suppose
it
would
depend
how
close
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
well,
they're
adjacent,
but
i
don't
know
what
sort
of
distances
we're
talking
about.
if
we're
talking
about
two
miles,
if
we've
got
one
farm
in
one
section
and
one
farm
in
another,
probably
not,
your
honor,
to
bridge
sections.
you
know,
you're
familiar
with
section
lines,
or
with
townships--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
state
boundaries
have
a
much
more
important
legal
importance,
because
states
are
the
units
by
which
water
is
managed.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
aquifers,
your
honor,
are
not
of
fixed
boundaries.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
transfer
of
water
is
not
permitted,
of
ground
water,
your
honor,
in
nebraska.
and
we
have
a
lot
of
dry
land
farming
in
nebraska.
i
guess
that's
what--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--your
honor,
water
is
attached
to
the
land.
if
the
land
is
merged
some
way,
then...
if
someone
wants
to
acquire
water,
they
can
acquire
the
land
and
they
acquire
the
water.
but
the
water
cannot
then
be
transferred
to
some
far-away
land.
it
cannot
be
used
for
non-agricultural
purposes.
in
this
case--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--well,
it's
entirely
possible
that
under
a
set
of
circumstances,
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
to
be
fair,
contained
in
the
colorado
amicus
brief
it
was
mentioned
that
the
nebraska
reciprocity
statute
is
not
the
only
problem
to
the
appellants.
appellants
had
applied
to
the
colorado
authorities
for
a
permit
to
have
a
well
on
the
colorado
tract
and
were
denied
that,
because
the
water
is
over-appropriated
in
colorado
under
the
colorado
system.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
oh,
yes,
very
definitely,
your
honor.
they
own...
yes,
it
doesn't
matter
who.
the
statute
applies
equally
to
all,
your
honor,
as
appears
from
the
face
of
it.
appellants
never
applied
for
a
permit,
your
honor.
they
were
never
denied
and
there
was
never
any
decision
upon
whether
the
permit
should
be
granted.
they
were
pumping
water
without
attempting
to
comply
with
the
nebraska
statute.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
the
law
is
now,
after
they
were
enjoined,
that
they
can't
get
a
permit.
but
they
never
applied
for
a
permit,
your
honor.
they
never
took
the
first
step.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--sell
that
water.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
i
don't
believe
that
under
the
decision
in
the
sporhase
case,
which
is
the
definitive
discussion
of
ground
water,
the
rights
to
ground
water,
that
they
could
do
that,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
spring
water?
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
it's...
spring
water,
i
believe,
your
honor,
would
be
ground
water--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--that
has
naturally
reached
surface
and
become
surface
water.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
i
suppose
so,
yes.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
not...
well,
it's
my
understanding
that
under
this
case,
your
honor,
under
the
sporhase
decision,
that
ground
water
would
not
be
able
to
be
sold.
now,
we
have
a
different...
i
think
we
have
to
realize
that
there
is
a
different
treatment
for
municipal
or
drinking
water
than
there
is
for
agricultural
and
irrigation
water.
the
mud
case,
which
was
referred
to
by
the
appellant,
is
a
case
which
does
deal
with
transportation
of
water,
and
that
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule.
the
general
rule
applies
to
agricultural
irrigation
water.
however,
the
rule
on
municipal
drinking
water
is
that
it
may
be
taken
from
the
sources
of
water
to
the
municipalities,
as--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
well,
your
honor,
the
municipality
is
the
landowner
in
that
case,
and
they
said
that
that...
the
municipality
is
not
charging
for
the
ground
water,
it
is
charging
for
the
cost
of
distributing
that
water,
not
the
value
of
the
water
itself.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
not
necessarily
so,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
thank
you.
one
of
the
conditions
that
has
to
be
met
is,
not
contrary
to
the
use
of
ground
water,
and
the
use
of
ground
water
in
the
state
is
use
with--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
i
think
that
this
case...
that
this
situation
would
only
apply
to
municipal
water
purposes,
your
honor.
this,
in
reading
the
legislative
history,
this
enactment
was
enacted
for
municipal
water
purposes,
so
that
the
city
of
superior,
nebraska,
could
acquire
a
municipal
water
supply
from
kansas.
the
distinction--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--well,
it
could.
it
could,
your
honor,
if
it
applied
the
same
standard
to
both
the
in-state
and
out
of
state
uses.
and
we
do
in
this
case...
we
wouldn't...
if
the
commerce
clause
applies,
then
we
would
have
to
be
uniform
for
both
in-state
and
out
of
state
uses.
and
the
real
question
is--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--well,
it
might,
your
honor.
the
problem
is--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--well,
by
that
i
meant,
your
honor,
that
the
state
is
looking
at
trying
to
balance
their
exports
and
their
imports,
and
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
is
water
on
the
land
that
is
in
the
state,
and
that
one
of
the
considerations--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
no,
that
is
not
the
case.
but
the
state
is
attempting
to
maintain
a
static
water
table
in
this
particular
area,
or
in
all
areas
of
the
state,
particularly
this
control
area
and
this
critical
township
where
the
well
is
located
and
where
there
is
a
great
deal
of
control.
the
problem...
the
reason
that
it
is
so
important
to
look
at
the...
whether
the
commerce
clause
applies
in
this
case
is
because
if
we
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
reciprocity
statute
is...
the
reciprocity
clause
should
be
considered,
evaluated,
we
then
are
concluding
that
the
commerce
clause
applies
to
water.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
commerce
clause
does
apply
to
water,
for
the
three
reasons,
for
one
of
the
three
reasons
that
either
congress
has
deferred
to
the
states
by
its
specific
enactment
of
statutes
again
and
again--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--all
of
those
statutes
contain
some
language
which
defers
to
the
states,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
it
has
not--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--well,
it
certainly
has
in
so
many
words,
yes,
your
honor.
it
says
in--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--section
8
of
the
1902
reclamation
act,
your
honor:
"nothing
in
this
act
shall
be--
"
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--i
don't
have
the--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--that's--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--yes,
your
honor,
23
of
my
brief
says:
"nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
as
affecting
or
intending
to
affect
or
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
laws
of
any
state
or
territory
relating
to
the
control,
appropriation,
use
or
distribution
of
water
used
in
irrigation
or
any
vested
right
acquired
thereunder.
"
and
that
the
united
states
shall
comply
with
those
laws.
and
this
is
repeated
over
and
over
again,
in
the
flood
control
act
of
1944--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--pretty
much,
and
they
go...
i
think,
your
honor,
that
by
these
37
acts,
by
the
repeated
ratification
and
approval
of
interstate
compacts
negotiated
by
the
states,
congress
has
specifically
recognized
that
the
states
have
the
power
to
manage
the
water.
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
their
decrees
of--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--there's
nothing
left
with
respect
to
the
natural
resource
water,
and
water
is
a
unique
natural
resource.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
that
is
determinative
of
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
there
is
specifically,
your
honor,
in
the
interstate
compacts
and
in
these
statutes
a
restriction
upon
water.
the
state
manages
the
water
and
by
their
management
decisions
they
restrict
the
water.
in,
for
instance,
this
case,
colorado
does
not
permit
by
its
decisions
water
now
to
be
exported
out
of
the
state
in
this
region.
the
appellants
applied
for
a
permit
to
use
water
on
their
overlying
land
and
it
was
denied.
anyone
applying
in
the
state
of
colorado
to
export
water
could
not
export
it.
their
management
of
the
water
of
colorado
prevents
exportation,
and
that
then
gets
us
into
a
commerce
clause
review.
and
congress
has
said
that
the
state
statutes
are
controlling
in
this
area
and
that
therefore
a
commerce
clause
review
is
not
necessary.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
aldus
case
deals
with
a
completely
different
state
management--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--i
think
we...
i
think
we
have
to
recognize,
your
honor,
that
where...
i
think
aldus
and
the
hudson
case
and
our
approach
in
this
case
are
all
consistent.
water
is
a
unique
natural
resource
in
a
state
where
it
is
dedicated
to
the
people
and
not
treated
as
a
commodity.
at
no
point
in
time
is
agricultural
irrigation
water,
or
water
at
all,
in
nebraska
treated
as
a
commodity,
as
an
article
of
commerce.
it
is
not
sold.
and
under
that
legal
framework,
as
is
true
with
the
eleven
states
that
filed,
generally,
the
eleven
states
that
filed
briefs
in
our
support,
water
is
not
reachable
by
the
commerce
clause,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
congressional
deference.
and
also,
i
think
we
can
look
to
the
legal
theory
of
the
usery
case,
where
water
in
the
state
of
nebraska
and
elsewhere
within
the
arid
western
states
has
become
an
area
of
traditional
functioning
by
the
states.
it's
part
of
the
state
sovereignty.
it
is
just
as
important
to
the
people
of
that
state
as
is
fire
protection,
as
is
police
protection,
as
is
health,
sanitation,
parks
and
recreation,
which
are
those
areas
mentioned
in
the
usery
case,
and
which
were
discussed
in
your
case
last
week
of
the
long
island
railroad
case.
the
usery
case
does
apply,
and
in
nebraska
there
are
day
to
day
decisions
being
made
relating
to
the
economics,
the
life,
of
drinking
water,
all
of
the
social
interests
of
the
people
of
nebraska,
as
in
arizona,
as
in
colorado
and
utah
and
the
other
western
states,
that
relate
directly
to
those
people's
everyday
lives.
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
we're
not--
mr.
george
roderic
anderson
--i
didn't
suggest
that,
your
honor.
we
are
dealing
with
irrigation
in
the
case
at
bar,
and
the
supreme
court
was
ruling,
our
nebraska
supreme
courts,
was
ruling
on
that
in
the
case.
i
think
that
as
far
as
irrigation
water
goes
in
agriculture,
it
is
not
subject
to
ownership,
to
sale
to
market-setting,
and
it
is
not
subject
to
the
commerce
clause.
we
would
urge,
your
honor,
that
you
affirm
the
nebraska
supreme
court
finding
that
water
is
a
unique
resource,
different
from
the
other
natural
resources
of
natural
gas,
et
cetera,
and
would
affirm
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
thank
you.
