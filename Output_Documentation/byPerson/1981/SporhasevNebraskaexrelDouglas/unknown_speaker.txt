unknown
speaker
how
deep
is
the
well?
unknown
speaker
how
expensive
to
put
it
in?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
he
had
put
it
six
feet
on
the
other
side
of
line,
he'd
have
had
the
same
problem,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
but
he
would
have
the
same
exportation
problem.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
colorado's
absolute
prohibition
is
less
vulnerable
to
commerce
clause
attack
than
nebraska's?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
rely
on
the
exception
for
reciprocity
that
nebraska
makes?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
nebraska...
with
a
permit
he
could
do
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
authorities
could
give
him
a
permit
under
nebraska
law.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
okay,
yes.
mr.
dudden,
may
i
ask...
this,
of
course,
is
a
commerce
clause
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
that
the
state
argues
at
pages
22
and
23
of
its
brief
that
congress
has
enacted
any
number
of
statutes...
i
think
they
say
37
of
them...
which
expressly
operate
to
exempt
regulation,
allocation
and
distribution
of
water
from
the
application
of
the
interstate
clause,
leaving
it
to
the
individual
states.
and
i
don't
see
that
you've
addressed
that
argument.
have
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask,
have
you
any
section
of
your
brief
which
addresses
that
particular
argument?
i
don't
see
a
reply
brief,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
if
congress...
if
they
were
right
and
congress
has
done
that,
that's
the
end
of
this
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
we're
going
to
have
to
find
out
for
ourselves,
are
we?
unknown
speaker
except
that
you're
going
to
address
it
in
your
oral
argument.
unknown
speaker
when
does
its
character
change,
if
it
does
change,
from
public
to
private?
unknown
speaker
that's
up
to
a
point.
after
you've
got
it
in
a
water
glass,
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
that
nobody
can
transfer
a
water
right
in
nebraska
and
get
paid
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
the
nebraska
law,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
case,
the
portland
cement
case,
in
the
thirties
say
that
the
desert
land
act
severed
the
waters
from
the
land
and
gave
the
control
of
the
waters
to
the
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
up
to
the
states,
though,
to
a
certain
extent,
to
say
whether
or
not
a
particular
natural
resource
is
subject
to
ordinary
commerce
within
or
without
the
state?
certainly,
if
they
say
it
is
subject
to
commerce
within
the
state,
they
can't
say
it's
not
subject
to
commerce
without
the
state.
but
as
i
understand
your
description
of
the
nebraska
water
law,
it's
that
no
one
acquires
a
ownership
in
water.
it's
simply
the
right
to
use
it
subject
to
the
public
trust.
unknown
speaker
so
really,
nebraska
has
taken
a
position
contrary
to
the
one
you
attribute
to
mr.
corker,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
your
client
decided
that
they
wanted
to
sell
topsoil
and
wanted
to
take
all
the
topsoil
off
of
the
140
acres,
or
whatever
it
is
that
you're
talking
about,
and
simply
ship
it
to
someone
else
in
another
state,
and
the
state
of
nebraska
says,
no,
topsoil
simply
isn't
a
marketable
commodity,
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
ship
topsoil
anywhere
because
it's
just
too
bad
for
the
land?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
didn't
rely
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
didn't
rely
on
the
reciprocity
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
that
was
an
important
part
of
your
case
or,
you
know,
a
significant
part
of
your
case,
that
the
nebraska
law
provided
for
reciprocity.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
your
case
is
stronger
than
if
nebraska
had
an
absolute
prohibition
against
the
interstate
transportation
of
water?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
be
making
the
same
arguments?
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
colorado's
prohibition
against
shipping
out
of
state,
water
out
of
state,
is
also
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
then
i
suppose
it
really
doesn't...
if
you
were
right
on
that...
does
colorado
follow
the
same
rule
of
law
that
nebraska
does
on
water
rights?
unknown
speaker
do
they
treat
it
just
like
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
is
their
law
substantially
the
same
as
oklahoma's
in
that
earlier
case?
unknown
speaker
or
texas,
whichever
it
was.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
your
complaint,
you
didn't,
or
did
you,
expressly
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
colorado
statute?
unknown
speaker
if
you
persuaded
the
court
that
that
statute
is
invalid,
then
i
suppose
you
would
have...
then
the
reciprocity
provision
of
the
colorado
statute
would
have
no
longer
been
a
bar.
unknown
speaker
but
you--
--but
you
didn't
raise
that.
it
wasn't
the
colorado
statute
that
is
interfering
with
your
business.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't.
unknown
speaker
now,
tell
me
again.
under
nebraska
law,
can...
are
water
rights
transferable
between
private
parties?
unknown
speaker
for
money?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they...
are
they...
can
they
be
separated
from
the
land?
unknown
speaker
exactly,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose...
but
water
rights
are
adjudicated,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
so,
if
you're
going
to
buy
a
piece
of
land,
you
get
either
a
title
opinion
or
title
insurance
with
respect
to
the
water
rights
too,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
no
problem
in
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
what
if
i
in
nebraska...
what
if
your
client
wanted
to...
wanted
to
sell
his
water
right
to
an
adjoining
landowner?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
in
colorado;
in
nebraska.
unknown
speaker
in
nebraska.
you
want
to
separate
the
land
from
the
water
and
sell
the
water
right.
can
you
do
that
in
nebraska?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
you
can
transfer
it
to
another
piece
of
agricultural
land?
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
sense...
and
he
could
be
paid
for
it?
unknown
speaker
in
nebraska.
now,
in
that
sense
it's
an
article
of
commerce.
unknown
speaker
but
he
cannot...
he
could
not
under
this
law,
i
take
it,
sell
that
water
right
to
somebody
in
colorado?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it's
very
good
water
that
your
client
has
on
his
land.
could
he
bottle
it
and
sell
it
over
in
omaha
and
lincoln?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
gives
some
hint
that
it's
an
article
of
commerce,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
limitation
on
the
areas
within
nebraska
to
which
you
can
transfer
agricultural
water?
is
there
a
limitation
to
the
particular
aquifer
or
valley?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
the
courts
or
the
administrative
agencies
taken
any
position?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
nebraska
law
forbade
on
its
face...
where
did
i
read
that?
the
inter-basin
transfer
of
water
except
where
a
municipality
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
just
a
flat
ban
on
transferring
water
from
one
watershed
to
another?
unknown
speaker
so
you
can't
take
it
out
of
the
one
basin?
unknown
speaker
even...
nobody
can
permit
that,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
state
of
nebraska
has
also
argued
that
we
should
look
at
the
interstate
compacts
that
have
been
approved
by
congress--
unknown
speaker
--as
an
indicator
that
congress
believes
that
states
are
free
to
allocate
and
direct
the
transfer
of
water
within
their
boundaries.
unknown
speaker
now,
your
clients'
well
is
in
a
critical
ground
water
basin?
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
you
were
given
permission
to
dig
the
well
and
withdraw
water?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
do
you
think
that
if,
say,
someone
decided
that
it'd
be
a
good
idea
to
buy
all
the
water
they
could
in
colorado
from
private
owners
and
use
it
to
transport
coal
in
a
slurry
pipeline
from
there
down
to
new
orleans,
and
that
everybody
agreed
that
if
the
project
were
carried
out
it
would
dry
up
all
of
the
eastern
slope,
do
you
think
colorado
would
have
any...
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
it
could
not
keep
that
water
from
being
sold
out
of
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't...
it
may
not
be
a
problem.
but
what
if
it
was?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
state
power?
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
have
to
leave
it
to
congress?
unknown
speaker
even
in
an
emergency,
the
state
would
not
have
the
power?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dudden,
what
about
as
a
conservation
measure,
the
state...
notwithstanding
the
water
may
be
subject
to
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
yes.
does
the
state
have
that
authority
even
as
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
the
instance
that
my
brother
white
put
to
you,
would
that
not
be
an
appropriate
and
constitutional
conservation
measure?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
you
could
conserve,
conservation
in
the
sense
you
conserve
it
for
use
inside
the
state,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
you
couldn't
possibly
keep
water
at
home
like
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
congress
could
by
a
statute
preempt
nebraska's
law?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
want
to
run
it...
i'm
asking
you
to
run
it
the
other
way,
that
congress
could
remove
any
barriers
that
state
law
might
erect
to
the
transportation
of
water
in
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
what?
you
don't
congress
has
that
power?
unknown
speaker
if
you
think
water
is
an
article
of
interstate
commerce,
which
it
is
in
a
lot
of
places,
you
mean
congress
couldn't
insist...
remove
state
barriers
to
interstate
trade
in
water?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
an
act
of
congress
would
interfere
with
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
the
commerce
clause
is
basically
just
a
grant
of
power
to
congress.
unknown
speaker
i'm
at
a
loss
to
see
how
an
act
of
congress
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause
could
interfere
with
the
commerce
clause.
well,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
your
friend,
in
response
to
a
question,
said
that
a
farmer
out
in
rural
areas
of
nebraska
who
had
especially
good
water
could
bottle
it
and
send
it
into
omaha
and
sell
it.
do
you
agree
with
that?
i
thought
he
said
that
the
supreme
court
had--
unknown
speaker
--well,
after
you've
got
it
in
quart
or
gallon
bottles
in
a
supermarket
in
omaha,
is
it
an
article
of
commerce,
or
is
just
the
bottle
an
article
in
commerce?
unknown
speaker
now,
it's
your
position,
counsel,
that
the
owner
of
farmland
could
not
sell
water
rights
to
be
used
on
an
adjacent
parcel
of
farmland?
unknown
speaker
even
in
the
same
basin?
unknown
speaker
are
you
speaking
not
only
of
ground
water,
but
of
irrigation
water
generally?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking--
unknown
speaker
--you
do
irrigate
some
farmland
in
the
north
platte
valley,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
the
source
of
the
water
is
the
river.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
stored
in
a
reservoir.
unknown
speaker
and
taken
out?
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
water
rights
and
farmers
have
individual
water
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
entitled
to
use
it
on
their
land.
unknown
speaker
can
that
water
be
sold
off
the
land?
can
it
be
transferred?
unknown
speaker
those
waters,
what
do
they
call
them?
rights,
shares,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
certainly
get
some
money
for
it
when
you
sell
your
land.
unknown
speaker
the
value
of
the
land
will
vary
on
whether
it's
got
some
water
rights
attached
to
it.
unknown
speaker
not
all
land
does.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
that
ground
water
has
to
be
used
on
the
overlying
land,
well,
you're
certainly
talking
about
a
bigger
piece
of
land
than
the
land
that
surrounds
the
pipe
within
six
feet.
i
suppose
you're
talking
about
the
owner
can
use
the
water
on
all
the
land
he
owns.
unknown
speaker
well,
adjacent
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
take
this
case.
let's
take
this
case.
there's
no
suggestion
that
this
particular
gentleman
who
wants
to
export
this
water
could
use
the
water,
his
ground
water,
on
all
the
land
he
owns
in
nebraska,
in
this
particular
piece?
unknown
speaker
how
many
acres
does
he
own
in
nebraska?
unknown
speaker
but
some
of
the
land
that
he
owns
in
colorado...
the
land
he
owns
in
colorado
is
just
as
close
to
the
well
as
the
land
he
owns
in
nebraska.
unknown
speaker
so
all
you're
saying...
but
certainly
some
of
the
land
in
colorado,
anyway,
would
be
called
overlying.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wouldn't
think
you
would.
unknown
speaker
you
say,
here's
a
piece
of
land
that's
within
100
feet
of
the
well.
the
only
thing
is
it's
in
colorado.
and
you
say
that
isn't
overlying,
although
there's
a
part
of
that
land
in
nebraska
that
is
2,000
feet
from
the
well
and
you
would
call
it
overlying?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
what
if
nebraska
just
repealed
its
reciprocity
provision
and
issued
a
permit
to
this
gentleman
to
transfer
the
water
to
colorado.
would
that
violate
any
interstate
compact?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
of
what
relevance
is
the
interstate
compact
that
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
mr.
anderson,
may
i
go
back
to
the
law
of
nebraska
with
respect
to
the
problem?
confining
ourselves
to
the
law
within
the
state
of
nebraska
to
adjacent
farms,
and
there's
a
well
on
one
and
not
a
well
on
the
other,
can
the
one
on
the...
how
does
the
second
farm
get
water?
what
kind
of
legal
arrangement
may
it
make
to
get
water
to
its
land
from
the
neighboring
farm
which
has
a
well?
unknown
speaker
yes.
just
nebraska,
just
nebraska.
i
just
want
to
get
the
adjacent
parcel
problem
sort
of
outlined.
unknown
speaker
one
has
a
well
and
one
does
not.
the
one
without
a
well
wants
to
get
water
from
his
neighbor.
can
he
do
it
legally
and
get
a
legally
binding
agreement
that
will
entitle
him
to
get
such
water?
unknown
speaker
he
cannot
get
any
legal
protection
for
his
rights
to
obtain
water
from
a
neighbor
who
happens
to
have
a
well?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
provision
in
nebraska
law
for
that
problem?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
i
want
to
get
away
from
the
platte
river
problem.
unknown
speaker
his
neighbor
does
have,
is
my
hypothesis.
is
there
any
way
in
which
he
can
get
a
legally
binding
commitment
from
his
neighbor
to
get
the
water
he
needs?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
could
just
add
one,
there
is
no
surface
water
in
that
area.
unknown
speaker
if
i
add
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question--
unknown
speaker
--there
is
no
surface
water
in
the
area.
unknown
speaker
it's
dry
land.
it's
dry
land,
then?
unknown
speaker
does
he
get
the
same
answer
if
the
land
on
which
the
well
was
located
purchased
the
adjacent
property
from
his
neighbor?
or
leased
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose
they're
adjacent.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
give
the
same
status
to
section
lines
that
you
do
to
state
boundaries?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
maybe
you
were
going
to
say
that
the
rule
would
be
that
if
the
adjoining
land
was
outside
the
reaches
of
the
aquifer
you
couldn't
use
it
on
that
land.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
but
usually
if
the
land
has
got
potential
value
somebody
has
tried
to
drill
a
well
on
it,
and
they've
found
out
that
it's
too
deep
or
they
just
don't
find
water.
and
so
they
would
like
to
transfer
water
from
somewhere
else.
unknown
speaker
here's
a
piece
of
dry
land
and
he
leases
it
to
the
fellow
who
has
drilled
a
well
and
found
water.
can
the
fellow
who
has
the
well
use
the
water
on
the
adjoining
piece
of
land?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
far
away.
it's
right
next
door.
it's
right
across--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
another
irrelevant
question,
probably.
the
sporhases
are
residents
of
colorado,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
my
question
now,
however,
is,
if
they
lived
on
the
nebraska
side
you'd
still
be
taking
the
same
position?
their
colorado
residence
is
immaterial
so
far
as
you're
concerned?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
thought
the
law
was,
and
the
supreme
court
said,
they
couldn't
get
a
permit
anyway,
because
there
was
no
reciprocity.
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back--
--go
ahead.
let
me
go
back
to
my
earlier
question.
now
i
am
frankly
confused.
your
friend
said
that
ground
water
could
be
taken
out
of
the
ground,
put
in
bottles,
shipped
over,
carried
over
by
truck
or
otherwise
to
omaha,
and
sold
in
the
supermarkets.
i
wasn't
sure
what
your
answer
was,
but
i
wish
you
would
clear
it
up.
can
they
do
that
with
ground
water
now?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
a
sharp
disagreement
between
the
two
of
you
on
that
particular
hypothetical.
i
think
in
light
of
the
nebraska
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case,
in
which
they
say
that
the
nabraskam
constitutional
provision
which
says
that
the
use
of
water
of
every
natural
stream
within
the
state
of
nebraska
is
dedicated
to
the
people
of
the
state
for
beneficial
purposes,
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
section,
and
that
that
section
applies
to
ground
water,
people
could
not
exercise
ownership
of
it
and
deprive
others.
they
have
to
use
it
and
let
it
flow
on,
and
they
can't--
--they're
not
depriving
others.
unknown
speaker
they
aren't
depriving
others.
they're
trying
to
share
it
with
them,
when
they
send
it
over
to
omaha
in
a
bottle.
but
you
say
they
can't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
what
is
spring
water?
unknown
speaker
is
that
ground
water?
unknown
speaker
i
was
thinking
about
it,
because
that's
the
water
that's
usually
bottled.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
usually
the
water
that's
bottled,
is
spring
water,
isn't
it?
if
it
was
spring
water--
unknown
speaker
--from
a
spring,
it
couldn't
be
transferred?
unknown
speaker
that
goes
for
ground
water,
too,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
my
landowner
may
transfer
water
to
the
municipality?
unknown
speaker
mr.
anderson,
if
colorado
had
a
reciprocity
statute
that
would
satisfy
the
colorado
requirement
for
reciprocity,
i
take
it
that
the
nebraska
statutes
would
permit
the
issuance
of
a
permit
to
take
the
water
out
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
now,
here's
what
the
supreme
court
says:
"the
statute
allows
such
transfers"...
namely,
transfers
across
state
lines...
"conditioned
on
the
receipt
of
a
permit
from
the
director
of
the.
"
"department
of
water
resources,
who
may
grant
the
permit
if
the
transfer
is
reasonable,
is
not
contrary
to
conservation,
and
the
use
of
ground
water.
"
that's
what
the
supreme
court
says.
now,
i'm
reading
from
a-7
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
page
119.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
they
might
forbid
it.
but
it
would
not...
they
could
also
permit
it--
unknown
speaker
--in
which
event
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
provision...
there
is
a
situation
in
which
water
may
be
transferred
outside
the
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
anderson,
may
i
ask
a
question,
please.
even
absent
this
reciprocity
provision,
could
not
nebraska
prevent
the
taking
of
the
water
in
any
area
where
it
was
determined
that
it
was
a
critical
water
area
and
it
should
not
be
used?
couldn't
nebraska
achieve
the
same
result
absent
a
reciprocity
provision
like
this?
unknown
speaker
and
it
might
reach
the
same
end
result
in
an
area
where
the
water
supply
is
low
or
critical,
right?
unknown
speaker
then
how
do
you
explain
the
statement
in
your
brief
where
you
talk
about
what
might
happen
if
we
were
to
invalidate
the
reciprocity
provision,
and
where
you
say
the
other
alternative
is
the
application
of
a
silent
de
facto
reciprocity
consideration?
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
you
saying
that
even
if
we
were
to
invalidate
it
you'd
consider...
you
would
do
the
same
thing
you're
now
doing?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
the
statement.
unknown
speaker
any
particular
one?
you've
got
37
of
them
cited
here.
you
mean
all
of
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
congress
said
in
so
many
words
in
any
of
these
statutes
that
the
commerce
clause
shall
not
apply
to
ground
water?
unknown
speaker
and
that
states
are
free
to
regulate
it?
has
it
said
that
in
so
many
words?
unknown
speaker
which
statute?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from,
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
it's
at
page
23
of
your
brief,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
where
you
cite
section
8?
unknown
speaker
in
pretty
much
those
words?
unknown
speaker
if
you're
right
about
this,
what's
left
of
the
commerce
clause
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
for
purposes
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
up
to
a
point
they
left
it
with
the
states.
but
there's
nothing
specific
in
these
acts
that
speak
about
interstate
commerce
or
against...
or
authorizing
the
restrictions
of
the
movement
of
water
to
another
state.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
correct
that
if
your
argument
based
on
these,
the
reclamation
act
and
the
other
statutes,
is
valid,
that
the
city
of
aldus
case
should
be
overruled?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
think
all
these
statutes
just
say
that
the
water
is
not
an
article
of
commerce
if
the
state
law
is
such
as
nebraska's?
that's
what
these
statutes
all
add
up
to?
unknown
speaker
now
let
me
take
you
back
to
that
quote
from
california
against
the
united
states
that
has
been
referred
to
in
the
colloquy.
i
read
that,
the
language
of
this
court,
as
being
limited
to
water
used
in
irrigation.
now,
is
in
your
view
all
the
water
that
we're
talking
about
used
in
irrigation?
this
isn't...
this
would
not
affect
bottling
the
water,
ground
water,
and
selling
it
in
supermarkets
in
omaha,
as
you
suggested.
unknown
speaker
this
is
irrigation.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is,
if
we're
to
say
that
congress
has
said
the
states
are
free
and
there's
no
commerce
clause,
whatever
it
may
be,
congress
gives
it
up,
they
have
to
say
so
in
explicit
words?
