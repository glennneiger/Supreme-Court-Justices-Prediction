mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people,
and
91
black
citizens
of
mississippi.
they
seek
reversal
of
a
mississippi
supreme
court
judgment
against
all
petitioners,
jointly
and
severally,
awarding
money
damages
and
an
injunction
because
of
a
civil
rights
boycott
against
white
merchants
in
mississippi.
the
claiborne
county
boycott
began
in
1966.
at
that
time,
discrimination
against
black
citizens
was
still
severe.
the
black
community,
including
the
local
chapter
of
the
naacp,
petitioned
to
correct
these
conditions,
and
participated
in
a
biracial
committee
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
port
gibson,
the
county
seat.
when
the
committee
failed
to
satisfy
these
grievances,
the
boycott
was
started.
its
purposes
were
to
end
racial
discrimination
in
employment
by
the
merchants
and
the
local
governments,
and
to
desegregate
the
school
system
and
other
public
facilities.
in
our
view,
this
case
raises
two
constitutional
questions.
one
is
whether
a
boycott
of
business
enterprises
in
support
of
a
petition
for
redress
of
civil
rights
grievances
conducted
by
non-violent
means,
such
as
speeches,
marches,
distributing
leaflets,
picketing,
and
social
ostracism,
can
constitutionally
expose
all
participants
to
liability
for
a
common
law
conspiracy
and
a
damage
judgment
for
all
business
losses
caused
by
the
boycott
merely
because
some
episodes
of
violence
by
some
participants
were
found
to
be
present
during
its
course.
the
second
is
whether,
even
assuming
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
damage
award,
all
the
active
participants
may
be
perpetually
enjoined
from
peaceful
activities
in
further
pursuit
of
the
boycott.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
on
particular
individuals,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
on
the
particular
portion
of
the
business
losses
resulting
from
those
acts
of
violence.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
sir.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
the
respondents
have
sidestepped
both
of
these
issues.
they
have
virtually
conceded
the
second
issue,
the
injunction
issue.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
they
said
it
was
moot,
justice
rehnquist.
we
did
argue
against
the
entire
judgment
below
on...
including
the
injunction,
on
first
amendment
grounds.
when
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
said
that
the...
we
had
admitted
the
injunction
was
moot,
we
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
saying
we
had
not
admitted
that,
that
the
injunction
was
still
in
effect,
and
that
it
was
an
unlawful
injunction
for
overbreadth,
and
our
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied,
and
the
injunction
remains
in
effect
subject,
of
course,
to
the
stay
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
will
terminate
when
this
court
has
passed
on
this
case.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
say
we
did,
and
we
certainly
argued
it
on
the
rehearing.
there
would
be
no
ambiguity
about
that.
we
argued--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--we
argued
the
first
amendment
invalidity
of
the
entire
judgment
below
in
our
briefs
below.
the
respondents
have
said
they
would
be
willing
to
delete
from
the
injunction
any
restraint
on
peaceful
boycott
activities,
so
that
seems
to
be
out
of
the
case.
as
for
the
first
issue,
they
say
that
the
court
should
not
pass
at
this
time
on
whether
the
first
amendment
protects
the
right
to
engage
in
peaceful
boycott
activities
because
in
their
view
this
boycott
was
not
peaceful
and
violence
was
pervasive
and
central
to
its
success,
and
to
sustain
this
charge,
they
go
far
beyond
the
actual
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
courts
below.
the
courts
below,
we
say,
did
not
find
violence
to
be
pervasive
or
central
to
the
success
of
the
boycott,
and
you
will
not
find
those
terms
or
any
fair
equivalent
in
their
opinions.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
cited
12
incidents
over
a
period
of
three
years
to
support
its
conclusion
that
"force,
violence,
and
threats.
"
were
"present"
during
the
course
of
the
boycott
and
were
"part
of
the
boycott
activity"
that
contributed
to
its
success,
and
that
this
was
enough
to
make
all
active
boycott
participants
liable
at
common
law
for
all
the
business
losses
suffered
by
the
merchants.
before
i
turn
to
those
12
incidents,
i
would
like
to
outline
our
basic
legal
position
in
three
simple
points.
the
first
is
that
this
nation
was
born
out
of
a
series
of
colonial
boycotts
against
british
merchants
in
support
of
petitions
to
the
british
king
and
parliament
for
the
redress
of
grievances.
the
need
to
organize
and
enforce
these
boycotts
led
to
the
first
continental
congress,
and
provided
the
cohesion
that
ultimately
enabled
the
american
colonies
to
win
their
independence.
these
boycotts
were
enforced
by
many
of
the
same
methods
of
surveillance,
denunciation,
and
ostracism
used
in
claiborne
county,
and
occasionally
there
were
episodes
of
violence,
such
as
the
boston
tea
party.
thomas
jefferson,
john
dickinson,
and
other
leaders
of
the
colonial
boycotts
regarded
them
as
lawful
methods
of
petition
for
the
redress
of
grievances,
while
conceding
that
the
perpetrators
of
unlawful
acts,
like
the
boston
tea
party,
should
be
held
answerable
for
their
conduct,
and
we
maintain
that
this
boycott
was
a
lawful
method
of
petition,
while
conceding
that
if
any
petitioner
were
found
to
have
committed
or
to
have
threatened
to
commit
an
act
of
violence
to
enforce
the
boycott,
that
petitioner
would
be
answerable
for
the
proven
consequences
of
his
act.
my
second
point
is
that
if
some
acts
of
violence
are
interspersed
among
other
peaceful
acts,
such
as
meetings,
parades,
speeches,
and
even
such
measures
of
non-violent
enforcement
as
surveillance,
denunciation,
and
ostracism,
as
was
true
of
the
enforced
colonial
boycotts,
and
we
submit
it
is
the
most
that
was
true
in
claiborne
county,
then
only
those
found
to
have
committed
the
violent
acts
may
constitutionally
be
held
liable
for
anything,
and
that
even
they
may
be
held
only
for
that
portion
of
the
merchant's
business
losses
that
is
reasonably
attributable
to
those
violent
acts.
while
i
suppose
one
could
hypothesize
a
boycott
in
which
no
customer
would
have
withheld
his
patronage,
but
for
the
violent
acts
of
the
organizers,
as
justice
brennan
hypothesized
in
the
gibbs
case,
so
that
those
who
committed
these
acts
would
be
liable
for
all
the
business
losses
of
the
merchants,
that
hypothesis,
we
say,
is
very
far
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
the
respondents
conceded
that
"most
of
the
witnesses"
that
they
themselves
had
called
to
testify
had
said
"they
voluntarily
went
along
with
the
naacp
and
their
fellow
black
citizens
in
honoring
and
observing
the
boycott
because
they
wanted
the
boycott.
"
my
third
point
is
a
corollary
of
the
first
two.
we
submit
that
no
one
may
be
held
liable
constitutionally
merely
for
organizing
or
participating
in
a
political
boycott
in
support
of
a
petition
for
the
redress
of
grievance,
or
for
enforcing
it
by
non-violent
means,
or
for
continuing
to
support
it
even
though
some
other
participants
have
been
engaging
in
acts
of
violence.
our
first
four
presidents,
all
three
authors
of
the
federalist
papers,
and
many
other
framers
of
the
constitution
participated
in
several
boycotts
of
precisely
this
kind.
they
believed
them
to
be
a
lawful
method
of
supporting
the
right
of
british
subjects
to
petition
for
the
redress
of
grievances,
and
when
they
adopted
the
first
amendment,
we
submit,
they
could
not
possibly
have
intended
to
exclude
from
its
protection
the
very
means
of
petition
that
they
themselves
had
employed.
indeed,
after
the
revolution,
and
at
the
very
time
that
the
constitution
was
being
ratified,
john
jay
and
alexander
hamilton
were
leading
a
boycott
enforced
by
similar
non-violent
means
against
new
york
city
merchants
who
engaged
in
the
slave
trade,
and
against
newspapers
which
carried
the
advertisements
of
those
merchants.
i
would
also
add
that
we
are
not...
we
don't
think
this
case
raises,
of
course,
the
issue
of
whether
such
boycotts
are
a
wise
political
tactic,
but
only
whether
they
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
we
don't
think
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
secondary
political
boycott
against
neutral
parties,
even
though
colonial
history
would
support
that,
because
these
merchants
were
deeply
involved
both
in
their
own
discriminatory
policies
and
those
of
the
city
and
county
governments,
and
because
the
mississippi
supreme
court
adopted
a
theory
of
liability
which
expressly
stated
it
didn't
matter
whether
the
boycott
was
primary,
secondary,
or
anything
else.
nor
do
we
think
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
boycott
that
is
unrelated
to
a
petition
for
the
redress
of
grievances
against
the
government.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
could,
to
come
back
to
the
12
incidents.
they
are
summarized
at
pages
28
through
33
of
our
main
brief.
in
only
one
of
those
12
incidents
did
the
court
below
find
that
an
identified
petitioner
committed
a
violent
act
to
enforce
the
boycott.
in
that
incident,
petitioner
james
bailey
testified
that
he
had
trampled
the
flower
garden
of
a
black
woman
because
she
patronized
white
stores,
despite
his
warning
not
to
do
so,
as
she
continued
to
do
thereafter.
and
the
trial
record
shows,
and
this
trial
was...
began
in
1973,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
no
one
else
in
the
town
had
ever
heard
of
that
incident
until
bailey
brought
it
up
on
the
witness
stand,
and
it
could
not
possibly
have
affected
the
success
of
the
boycott.
witness
after
witness
was
asked,
once
bailey
said
this,
did
you
ever
hear
of
this
incident,
and
they
all
said
no.
there
were
two
other
incidents
involving
acts
of
violence
that
were
charged
to
identified
petitioners,
but
in
neither
case
did
the
courts
below
make
a
finding
that
the
petitioner,
any
petitioner
had
committed
an
unlawful
act.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
i
am
not
saying
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
any
boycott
participant
committed
an
unlawful
act,
be
it
violence
or
any
other
normal
tort
or
crime,
and
that
incident
had
the
effect
of
persuading
or
coercing
a
substantial
number
of
people
not
to
participate
in
the
boycott
and
therefore
contributed
materially
to
the
success
of
the
boycott,
we
would
admit
that
individual
is
subject
to
liability
for
the
proven
damages
of
the
unlawful
act
he
committed.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
except
that
she
continued
to
trade
at
the
white
stores,
as
the
testimony
shows.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes.
the
only
evidence
is
bailey's
evidence,
and
no
evidence
to
contradict
that
was
offered.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that's
right.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
he
was
asked
by...
bailey
was
asked
by
mr.
pyles,
did
she
continue
to
trade
at
the
white
stores?
answer:
yes.
that
is
in
the
transcript.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
gilmore
shooting
incident
is
the
next
one
i
am
coming
to,
justice
stevens.
there
were
three...
three
of
our
petitioners
who
were
prosecuted
and
on
a
first
trial
convicted
of
that
offense,
but
that
conviction
was
reversed
because
of
discrimination
in
selection
of
the
jury.
on
a
second
trial,
the
jury
hung,
so
there
was
no
jury
verdict,
and
neither
the
chancellor
nor
the
mississippi
supreme
court
made
a
finding
that
the
three
petitioners,
who
of
course
had
denied
in
their
trial
any
participation,
had
in
fact
committed
the
act.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
all
the
tea
on
the
ship,
yes.
i
think
no
question.
and
indeed,
you
will
find
in
the
papers
of
the
first
continental
congress,
in
the
so-called
address
to
the
british
people
which
accompanied
the
boycott
resolution
in
the
continental
association,
a
statement
that
the
perpetrators
of
the
boston
tea
party
may
have
been
guilty
of
a
trespass,
and
that
the
courts
of
massachusetts
bay
were
open,
but
instead
of
that,
the
british
had
responded
by
restricting
self-government
in
massachusetts
bay
and
passing
the
so-called
intolerable
acts.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
let
me
come
directly
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
will
skip
over
the
others
of
the
12
episodes.
they
are
covered
in
our
brief,
and
you
will
see
some
of
them
are
not
violent
at
all,
and
the
last
of
them
is
the
naacp
providing
counsel
to
persons
arrested
in
the
course
of
the
boycott
activity,
but
let's
go
directly
to
the
remark
of
charles
evers,
who
was
a
leader
of
the
boycott,
and
an
naacp
local
secretary
at
the
time.
there
was
testimony
of
a
remark
by
evers
in
the
course
of
a
long
speech,
"if
we
catch
any
of
you
going
in
any
of
them
racist
stores,
we're
going
to
break
your
goddamn
neck.
"
some
of
the
testimony
places
that
speech
both
in
1966,
or
that
remark
in
1966,
when
the
boycott
began,
and
also
in
1969,
in
a
speech
given
two
days
after
the
shooting
of
a
black
youth
by
a
white
policeman
that
had
caused
great
disturbances
in
the
town.
there
is
no
tape,
film,
or
copy
of
that
remark
or
the
speech
in
which
evers
made
it
in
the
record,
but
there
is
testimony,
there
is
testimony,
of
course,
as
i
said,
and
evers
has
admitted
making
the
remark,
and
respondents
have
also
relied
on
threats
that
they
read
into
another
speech
that
was
given
on
april
the
19th,
the
night
after
the
shooting
of
the
black
youth
by
the
white
policeman,
which
is
in
the
record,
and
on
which
the
respondents
now
rely.
we
urge
you,
your
honors,
to
read
that
speech.
it
is
at
page
85
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
catches
the
flavor
and
the
currency
of
the
moment,
and
it
graphically
describes
the
grievances
of
the
black
citizens
of
claiborne
county
13
years
ago.
its
main
thrust
was
to
persuade
the
crowd
not
to
engage
in
violent
responses
because
of
this
shooting
against
the
"white
brothers",
as
evers
called
them,
but
to
persevere
with
the
boycott.
the
remark,
the
1969
one,
at
least,
which
is
the
only
one
there
is
any
real
proof
of,
was
made
in
the
emotional
aftermath
of
the
killing
of
that
black
youth
by
a
white
policeman,
and
you
will
see
from
the
speech
that
is
in
the
record
how
unjustified
the
black
community
thought
that
shooting
was,
but
most
importantly,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
either
of
these
two
speeches
of
mr.
evers
had
any
effect
on
the
boycott.
the
two
i
am
speaking
of,
april
19th
and
21st,
1969,
occurred
three
years
after
the
boycott
began
and
after
all
the
other
eleven
incidents
described
by
the
chancellor
had
occurred.
they
couldn't
have
led
to
those
incidents,
and
they
couldn't
have
had
a
major
effect
on
the
success
of
the
boycott,
which
was
already
three
years
old.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
state
court
concluded
that
the
black
people
had
believed
evers
after
quoting
that
remark.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
court
drew
a
conclusion
that
remark
had
had
an
influence,
justice
white.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
am
not
sure
you
could
call
it
a
finding.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
might...
i
would
have
to
concede
that,
but
in
support
of
mine,
there
were
20--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--that
is
correct,
but
there
is
a
duty,
i
believe,
to
which
respondents
agree
in
cases
like
this
for
this
court
to
make
an
independent
examination
of
the
record.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
think
in
almost
all
of
these
constitutional
cases
involving
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
justice
rehnquist,
the
court,
this
court
has
gone
into
the
record
behind
such
findings,
as
in
edwards
against
south
carolina,
and
both
sides
conceded
here
that
you
should
go
into
the
record
that
way.
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
22
black
witnesses
were
called
by
the
merchants
and
asked
about
whether
they
had
ever
heard
of
the
evers
remark
about
breaking
necks.
sixteen
of
them
said
that
they
had
never
heard
of
it
at
all,
and
six
said
they
had
heard
of
it
only
in
1969,
three
years
after
the
boycott
began,
and
none
of
the
many
black
witnesses
called
by
these
merchants
testified
as
to
any
fear
of
physical
violence
because
of
the
evers
speeches.
the
respondents
have
only
cited
to
you
four
instances
in
which
anyone
testified
about
fear
of
punishment
or
discipline,
and
the
context
of
at
least
two
of
those
statements
shows
that
they
were
speaking
of
fear
of
denunciation
and
ostracism.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
words
of
edwards
against
south
carolina
are
that
this
court
should
make
an--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--independent
examination
of
the
record,
but
i
would
submit
to
you,
justice
white,
that
if
you
took
the
12
episodes
on
the
face
of
what
the
two
courts
below
said
about
those
episodes,
the
facts
as
they
described
them,
you
cannot
conclude
that
what
is
described
in
those
12
episodes
was
pervasive
or
central
to
the
success
of
this
boycott.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would
certainly
call
it
a
normal
part
of
the
process.
unfortunately,
there
are
times
when
violence
becomes
part
of
the
process,
and
none
of
us
are
trying
to
defend
that.
the
naacp
has
a
very
long
record
against
violence.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
to
keep
the
boycott
going,
and
there
is
no
doubt
there
were
threats
in
the
sense
of
justice
holmes'
sense
that
whether
a
threat
is
unlawful
depends
on
what
it
is
you
threaten.
there
were
undoubtedly
threats
that
if
you
went
into
the
white
store,
your
name
would
be
read
out
in
church,
you
would
be
denounced,
and
you
would
be
socially
ostracized.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
say
that
was
precisely
the
function
of
the
committees
of
correspondence
formed
by
the
first
continental
congress,
and
it
was...
it
is
so
wrapped
into
our
history
that
is
a...
not
only
a
boycott,
but
that
type
of
enforcement
of
a
boycott
is
a
legitimate
means
of
petitioning
for
the
redress
of
grievances.
we
do
not
see
how
the
first
amendment
could
be
read
to
the
contrary.
i
think
i
have
just
a
couple
of
minutes
left,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
would
like
to
save
that
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
the
chancellor
of
the
trial
court
found
that
claiborne
county
had
a
population
of
10,900
persons,
only
2,500
of
whom
were
white,
and
the
chancellor
used
that
to
deduce
that
the
white
merchants
were
especially
vulnerable
to
a
boycott.
so
it
is
7,500
people
who
were
supposed
to
have
been
intimidated
by
violence
and
threats
of
violence
in
order
to
make
this
boycott
the
success
that
both
courts
below
found
it
was.
the
theory
of
the
trial
was
to
call,
in
addition
to
the
sheriff,
a
series
of
black
persons,
and
to
ask
them
whether
they
were
intimidated,
and
whether
they
had
heard
of
particular
acts
of
violence,
or
whether
they
had
been
victims
of
acts
of
violence,
and
as
i
mentioned
to
you
earlier,
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
these
respondents
said,
and
this
is
in
our
reply
brief,
most
of
the
witnesses
that
they
themselves
had
called
testified
they
voluntarily
went
along
with
the
naacp
and
their
fellow
black
citizens
in
honoring
and
observing
the
boycott
because
they
wanted
the
boycott.
and
regardless
of
how
one
might
read
this
record,
the
way
the
mississippi
supreme
court
read
the
record
citing
the
12
episodes
that
i
have
referred
to,
including
the
evers
threat,
was
that
violence
was
force,
violence,
and
threats,
and
the
word
"threats"
is
ambiguous
because
it
may
also
refer,
as
some
of
the
witnesses
said,
to
threats
of
denunciation
and
ostracism,
but
taken
even
as
threats
of
physical
violence,
were
present
during
the
boycott.
present
is
the
theory.
if
it
is
present,
that
is
enough
on
a
conspiracy
theory.
and
that
this
presence
was
"part
of
the
boycott
activity"
that
contributed
to
the
boycott's
success.
so,
on
the
words
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
there
is
nothing
like
a
finding
that
violence
was
pervasive
or
that
it
accounted
for
all
the
success
or
even
most
of
the
success.
it
was
part
of
the
activity
that
contributed
to
the
success.
on
the
question
of
parsing
out
which
parts
of
a
mixture
of
lawful
conduct
and
unlawful
conduct
have
to
be
separated
in
assessing
causation
and
damages,
in
constitutional
cases,
this
court
has
been
very
clear
several
times
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
trial
court
to
separate
those
factors
out.
in
pennington,
you
sent
the
case
back
because
there
was
a
mixture
of
an
antitrust
conspiracy
to
put
the
small
coal
mine
operators
out
of
business,
and
protected
lobbying
efforts
to
get
the
secretary
of
labor
to
establish
a
regulation
that
would
help
put
them
out
of
business.
you
said
no
damages
could
be
assessed
for
the
protected
effort.
in
gibbs,
mr.
justice
brennan
announced
a
similar
rule
because
there
the
damage
had
resulted
in
part
from
legitimate
protected
picketing
activity
and
in
part
from
improper
activity.
in
berkey,
an
antitrust
case
that
the
second
circuit
has
just
decided,
deciding
a
number
of
your
cases,
they
separated
out
damage
to
an
antitrust
plaintiff
to
distinguish
between
the
effects
of
legitimate
competition
and
the
effects
of
the
unlawful
act.
it
is
a
perfectly
standard
way
of
going
about
this
sort
of
a
problem.
i
had
thought
the
issue
of
primary
and...
whether
this
was
a
primary
or
secondary
boycott
was
out
of
the
case
and
that
if
peaceful,
the
respondents
did
not
challenge
it.
i
take
it
now
the
respondents
continue
to
challenge
whether
boycotts,
peaceful
boycotts
are
constitutionally
protected.
i
would
remind
you
in
that
connection
about
thornhill
against
alabama,
which
expressly
protects
primary
boycotts
and
picketing
with
the
purpose
and
effect
of
persuading
people
in
a
labor
dispute
not
to
patronize
the
employer.
and
in
alabama
against
naacp,
justice
harlan
said
for
this
court
that
when
alabama
tried
to
throw
the
naacp
out
of
alabama
for
a
series
of
alleged
unlawful
acts,
including
the
boycott
of
the
montgomery
busing
system,
he
said
that
even
if
one
assumed
that
such
an
act,
a
boycott
could
be
validly...
could
be
charged
as
unconstitutional
under
a
valid
statute,
he
expressed
great
doubts
as
to
whether
that
could
be
done,
that
you
could
not
have
a
valid
statute
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
for
this
case,
justice
powell,
i
think
you
only
need
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
applies
to
petitions
for
the
redress
of
grievances
in
support
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
whether
it
applies
to
any
boycott
seeking
some
change
in
governmental
policy
one
could
leave
for
another
day,
although
i
do
think
the
colonial
history
supports
even
that,
and
i
would
remind
you
once
more
that
contrary
to
what
my
friend
has
said,
not
only
do
we
have
colonial
history,
we
have
alexander
hamilton
and
john
jay,
two
of
the
authors
of
the
federalists,
the
very
time
the
constitution
was
being
ratified,
leaving
the
boycott--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--in
thornhill--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--a
labor
boycott
was
protected
under
the
first
amendment
as
a
primary
boycott
in
thornhill.
secondary
boycotts,
you
have
protected
in
tree
fruits
where
it
involved
only
one
product,
but
because
it
was
a
labor
dispute
and
you
recognized
the
congressional
interest
in
avoiding
the
spread
of
labor
strife,
you
have
drawn
the
line
at
a
secondary
boycott
against
all
the
products
of
a
neutral
employer.
indeed,
i
would
remind
you,
these
defendants
were
in
no
sense...
plaintiffs,
i
mean,
in
no
sense
neutral.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
really
does
not,
justice
powell.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
you
would
put
that
to
me...
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
did
you
say...
yes.
i
take
it
you
are
saying
they
were
identified
people,
justice
powell,
who
committed
the
acts
of
violence.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
think,
justice
powell,
that
is
a...
could
be
a
legitimate
jury
question
to
decide
how
much
of
the
loss
of
business
was
caused
by
the
act
of
violence,
and
as
justice
brennan
hypothesized
in
the
gibbs
case,
if
you've
got
a
situation
as
grave
as
meadowmore,
where
violence
was
in
fact
pervasive,
a
jury
could
conceivably
find,
or
a
factfinder
could
find
that
all
of
the
damage
resulted
from
the
violence.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
or
if
you
had...
i
could
change
your
example
from
three
to
three
a
day,
it
could
be
the
entire
$100,000.
a
jury
could
find
that.
