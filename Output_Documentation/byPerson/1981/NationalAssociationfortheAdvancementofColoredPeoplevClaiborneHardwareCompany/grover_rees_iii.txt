mr.
grover
rees,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
dispute
about
the
facts.
because
the
facts
are
so
important,
i
must
deal
at
the
outset
with
a
matter
that
i
do
not
relish
getting
into.
petitioners
have
made
it
an
important
part
of
their
case--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--well,
we
believe
it
is
a
dispute
about
the
facts.
we
believe
it
is
also
a
dispute
about
what
the
court
found.
we
believe
that
petitioners
have
made
a
number
of
statements
in
their
reply
brief
that
make
it
look
as
though
we
simply
made
false
statements
about
the
facts
and
about
what
the
courts
found
in
our
briefs,
particularly
about
the
record.
we
will
try
to
deal
with
some
of
these
matters
in
the
argument,
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
request
a
supplemental
brief
on
these
new
statements
about
what
is
in
the
record,
we
would
be
very
happy
to
supply
one.
assuming
that
the
court
does
desire
a
supplemental
brief,
though,
we
particularly
urge
you
not
to
rely
on
any
of
the
petitioners'
assertions
in
the
reply
brief
that
things
are
uncontradicted
in
the
record,
because...
because
those
things
aren't
uncontradicted
in
the
record.
we
stand
by
everything
that
we
said
in
our
brief.
fortunately,
most
of
the
petitioners'
assertions
about
the
record
are
called
into
question
by
a
reading
of
the
opinions
below.
the
petitioners
say
that
the
boycott
was
peaceful
and
voluntary,
but
the
state
courts
found
that
it
was
violent
and
coercive.
the
petitioners
say
that
the
naacp
never
condoned
violence,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
they
did,
but
the
courts
found
that
violence
was
in
fact
promised
by
the
field
secretary
of
the
naacp
and
that
the
black
people
of
port
gibson
did
not
regard
this
as
harmless
political
hyperbole.
violence
was
in
fact
delivered
before,
during,
and
after
the
period
of
time
during
which
he
made
his
statements.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
the
court
did
not
engage
in
the
kind
of
factfinding
that
the
petitioners
seem
to
think
that
they
had
to
engage
in.
they
didn't
say,
we
find
on
page
12-352
that
so
and
so
was
scared
by
evers.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
the
statement
was--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--the
statements
that
i
think
are
most
relevant
in
the
court
opinion...
you
have
33
pages
that
say
the
facts
in
the
record.
there
are
many
things
in
there
that
i
think
are
findings
that
they
don't
think
are
findings,
but
the
two
most
relevant
statements
are
that
the
field
secretary
of
the
naacp
promised
physical
violence
on
at
least
two
occasions,
and
that
it
is
evident
that
black
people
believed
him.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
yes,
that's
a...
well,
that's
a
paraphrase.
i
can
find
it.
just
a
moment.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
that's
not
on
the...
that's
not
in
the
record.
that's
in
the
trial
court
opinion.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
and
that
is...
i'll
get
you
the
page
in...
in
just
a
moment.
that's
on
page
39-b,
i
believe,
in
the
appendix,
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
unquestionably,
the
word
got
around--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--one
was
in
1966
and
one
was
in
1969.
it
said
at
least--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--yes,
we
do.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
first
of
all,
we
rely
on
it
as
evidence
to
support
the
many
other
contentions
in
the
record,
that
when
he
said
things
like
that
people
were
going
to
be
disciplined,
and
when
they
were
going
to
be
chastised,
and
so
forth,
that
he
didn't
mean
that
people
were
going
to
come
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
them
bad
names.
secondly,
this
was
an
ongoing--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--i
think
that's
true,
because
the
district
court
believed
that
a
secondary
boycott,
even
though
it
is
for
political
purposes,
was
enough
for
liability.
now--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--no,
they
didn't,
but
they
did.
they
didn't
have
to,
but
they
did.
they
made--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--the
problem
is
that
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
there
aren't
many
times
when
the
leader
of
a
group
like
this
comes
out
and
says,
yes,
i
am
in
favor
of
the
violence,
and
we
ought
to
go
ahead
and
do
it,
and
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
from
other
people,
from
witnesses,
that
they
heard
him
say
that
if
you
go
into
the
stores,
that
you
will
be
taken
care
of,
and
you
will
be
disciplined.
in
his
testimony
he
said,
oh,
we
just
meant
we
were
going
to
give
them
a
good
tongue-lashing,
and
the
petitioners
rely
on
that
in
their
brief.
now,
i
think
that
the
state
court
used
that
because
it
was
the
most
vivid
instance.
the
boycott
did
continue.
in
fact,
it
intensified
in
april
of
1969.
the
fact
that
those
particular
12
incidents...
actually,
we
count
15
in
the
trial
court,
in
three
pages
of
the
trial
court's
opinion,
happened
before
that
are
irrelevant.
the
court
found
that
on
many
occasions
people's
purchases
were
taken
away
from
them,
and
so
forth,
and
this
was
an
ongoing
course.
the
petitioners
would
have
you
look
only
at
those
three
pages
in
the
trial
court
opinion,
and
those
are
the
only
evidentiary
facts
that
they
want
to
be
allowed
to
be
supported,
to
be
supportive
of
the
ultimate
conclusion
in
the
state
supreme
court's
opinion
that
there
was
the
agreed
use
of
violence.
we
believe
that
the
proper
standard
of
review
is
that
the
court
should
look
at
the
whole
record,
should
look
at
everything
to
see
if
there
was
evidence
from
which
a
reasonable
trier
of
fact
might
have
concluded
the
conclusions
that
the
state
court
in
fact
made.
you
see,
on
the
one
hand,
they
say,
well,
this
is
just
anecdotal,
and
this
is
just
sporadic,
but
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
trial
court
ties
it
together
and
says
that
unquestionably
many
black
persons
had
their
volition
overcome,
and
they
were
forced
against
their
personal
wills
not
to
trade
with
the
white
merchants,
they
say,
oh,
well,
there
is
really
no
evidence
to
support
that,
because
we
can
distinguish
all
of
those
12
incidents.
we
don't
believe
that
is
the
proper
standard
of
review.
we
do
think
that
the
threat
is
relevant
both
in
and
of
itself,
because
he
did
promise
to
deliver
violence,
and
that
scared
people.
the
boycott
continued,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
if
the
design
of
the
boycott,
if
what
the
boycott
was
about
was
to
stop
people
from
going
in
the
stores
because
they
were
scared
that
they
would
be
beaten
up
and
shot
at
and
so
forth,
that
that
is
enough,
and
that
continued
after
april,
1969.
and
we
think
it
is
also
very
relevant
to
show
that
when
he
said,
for
instance,
earlier,
he
said,
you
had
better
not
bother
to
go
get
the
sheriff,
because
the
sheriff
can't
sleep
with
you
at
night,
that
he
didn't
mean
that
the
sheriff...
that
people
were
going
to
come
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
people
bad
names.
he
meant
that
bad,
violent
things
were
going
to
happen
to
people.
he
was
trying
to
instill
fear
in
them,
so
that
they
would
honor
the
boycott.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
actually,
we
don't
believe
that.
they
claim
in
their
reply
brief
that
we
concede
that
if
it
was
a
non-violent
secondary
boycott,
that
it
was
protected
first
amendment
activity.
we
don't
think
that
the
boston...
that's
not
true.
we
don't
concede
that.
this
court's
opinions,
you've
got
different
lines
of
opinions
that
would
suggest
different
results
on
that
issue.
certainly
the
labor
secondary
boycott
opinions
suggest
that
this
activity,
picketing
in
support
of
a
secondary
boycott,
is
something
less
than
absolutely
protected
first
amendment
activity,
because
if
you
can
curtail
that
activity
because
it
foments
labor
unrest,
which
was
the
basis--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--yes,
even
non-violent
labor
picketing.
we
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
issue,
because
the
state
courts
here
found
that
it
was
violent,
and
they
found
that
the
violence
was
not
sporadic,
that
it
was...
that
it
was
continuous,
that
it
was
pervasive.
we
think
that
if
you
read
the
33
pages
in
the
trial
court's
opinion,
where
the
judge
says,
these
are
the
statements,
the
facts
in
the
record,
is
what
it
says,
that
the
trial
judge
would
be
very,
very
surprised
to
learn
that
he
didn't
find
that
violence
was
central
to
the
success
of
the
boycott.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
he
also
said
that
unquestionably,
in
terms
of
the
damage
that
was
caused,
he
didn't
name
specific
people
who
were
frightened,
but
he
said
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
volition
of
many
black
persons
was
overcome
out
of
sheer
fear,
and
they
were
compelled
against
their
personal
wills
to
withhold
their
trade
and
business
intercourse
from
the
complainants.
that
is
on
page
39-b,
and
that
looks
like
a
finding
to
me.
the...
the
petitioners'
contention
that
these
things
aren't
findings
really
boil
down
to,
as
do
all
of
their
other
arguments,
to
the
one
argument
that
they
really
have,
which
is
that
this
was
a
civil
rights
boycott,
and
civil
rights
boycotts
are
entitled
to
strict
scrutiny.
i
think
it
is
evident
from
the
petitioners'
case
that
strict
scrutiny
has
replaced
banging
on
the
table
as
what
an
advocate
does
when
the
law
is
against
him
and
the
facts
are
against
him.
in
this
case,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
obstacle
they
are
facing
is
the
fact
that
the
court
usually
respects
the
reasonable
findings
of
state
courts,
or
the
rule
that
in
a
civil
case
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
the
test
that
is
usually
used,
or
the
fact
that
intent
can
be
inferred
from
conduct,
or
the
very
limited
first
amendment
protection
to
secondary
picketing
or
to
threats
to
break
people's
necks.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
petitioners
remind
this
court
that
this
is
a
civil
rights
case,
and
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
fact
or
a
finding
or
a
rule
of
law
that
can't
be
avoided
by
the
application
of
the
right
level
of
judicial
scrutiny.
the
problem
that
we
find,
the
most
serious
problem
that
we
find
with
this
contention
is
that
everybody
who
ever
engages
in
any
kind
of
concerted
action,
whether
it
is
labor
unions
or
other
political
groups
whose
goals
are
not
the
goals
of
the
naacp,
or
anyone
else,
believes
that
he
is
fighting
for
his
civil
rights.
now,
the
rules,
the
kinds
of
substantive
rules
that
they
are
arguing
for
here,
whether
it
is
first
amendment
protection
of
certain
kinds
of
threats
or
whether
it
is
ultra-strict
standards
of
review
where
you
have
to
make
the
state
courts
say
things
in
certain
words
before
you
have
a
finding,
those
are
not
susceptible
of
general
application.
so
if
you
hold
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
the
holding
will
have
to
rest
not
on
what
was
done
but
on
the
status
of
those
who
did
it.
they
say,
in
fact,
we
are
the
naacp
and
we
do
not
engage
in
violence,
we
do
not
engage
in
constitutionally
unprotected
conduct,
and
therefore
the
state
courts
must
have
been
wrong,
and
they
suggest
a
number
of
devices,
a
number
of
strict
scrutiny
devices,
a
number
of
extraordinary
tests
for
determining
intent,
and
so
forth,
by
which
the
court
might
reach
that
decision.
we
think
that
they
should
fail.
if
the
court,
if
the
state
courts
were
right
about
the
facts,
then
they
were
right
about
the
law.
the
first
amendment
does
protect
advocacy
of
opinions.
it
protects
that
advocacy
no
matter
how
controversial
the
opinions
are,
no
matter
how
vigorous
the
advocacy,
but
it
does
not
protect
forceful
and
credible
threats
of
violence.
the
fact
that
some
of
the
framers
were
willing
to
countenance
14
or
15
months
before
the
american
revolution
certain
kinds
of
actions
against
the
british,
indeed,
some
of
them
were
willing
to
countenance
the
boston
tea
party
itself,
is
no
evidence
that
if
you
have
a
boston
tea
party,
or
that
if
you
have
something
that
happened
in
1773
against
the
british,
that
they
intended
to
constitutionalize
that,
that
in
1989
and
in
1866
they
intended
to
make
that
a
binding
rule
on
the
states
and
say,
you
can't
prohibit
this
kind
of
activity,
that
is
not
an
adequate
constitutional
test.
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
petitioners
in
their
brief,
the
watts
case,
involved
a
highly
conditional,
an
expressly
conditional
threat
to
kill
the
president,
which
was
a
highly
improbable
action.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
president
had
any
reason
to
be
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
be
killed.
in
the
brandenberg
case,
you
had
12
people
out
in
the
middle
of
a
field
at
night
talking
to
a
television
newsman,
and
saying
that
if
congress
doesn't
change
its
policies
one
of
these
years,
we
might
have
to
consider
something
called
revengence.
that
is
not
what
this
case
was
about.
there
was
no
evidence
that
congress
was
afraid
in
that
case.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
abstract
teaching.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
abstract
possibility
of
violence
at
a
hypothetical
future
time.
you
had
several
hundred
people
in
a
small
town,
setting
themselves
up
as
the
law
outside
the
law.
their
leader
had
espoused
on
many
occasions
the
philosophy
that
every
race
has
a
right
to
its
own
discipline,
and
the
designated
enforcers
of
the
boycott,
the
court
found
that
the
black
hats,
this
group
of...
a
paramilitary
organization
of
50
young
men
who
watched
the
stores
and
who
participated
themselves
in
many
of
the
acts
of
violence
were
the
designated
enforcers
of
the
boycott,
designated
by
the
naacp.
contrary
to
what
the
petitioners
say
in
their
brief,
evers
testified
that
he
knew
about
these
people.
he
said
he
didn't
know
about
their
constitution
and
bylaws,
about
whether
they
were
a
member
of
a
chapter
of
a
regional
organization.
he
knew
they
were
there.
he
said
that
he
would...
there
was
testimony
that
he
had
referred
to
them
100
times
as
his
enforcers.
these
people
had
participated
in
violent
acts
pursuant
to
the
philosophy
that
their
leader
had
espoused.
the
incident,
which
was
only
the
most
vivid
of
a
number
of
incidents,
where
he'd
sit
across
from
a
row
of
stores
and
said,
if
you
go
in
those
stores,
we
are
going
to
break
your
damn
neck,
suggests
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
john
stuart
mill
was
talking
about
when
he
said
that
an
opinion
that
corn
dealers
are
starvers
of
the
poor,
or
that
private
property
is
robbery,
ought
to
be
unmolested
when
simply
circulated
through
the
press,
but
may
justly
incur
punishment
when
delivered
orally
to
an
excited
mob
before
the
house
of
the
corn
dealer.
we
would
like
to
suggest
that
mill
was
right
about
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
we
do
believe
that
there
is
evidence.
we
believe
that
there
is
evidence
to
support
the
trial
court's
findings.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
yes.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
i
do
believe
that,
your
honor.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
we
will
do
that,
your
honor.
we
would
like
to--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--they
did.
they
said
that
what
makes
this
a
conspiracy...
this
was
the
state
supreme
court.
they
said,
the...
their
conclusion,
their
holding
was
not--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--they
did
not
go
through--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--no.
they
did
not
do
that.
now,
they
said
that
they...
they
said
in
their
holding--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--well,
it
is
going
to
be
a
substantial
task.
i
am
aware
of
that.
but
the
court
has
asked
us
to
do
it,
and
we
are
going
to
go
through
the
16,000-page
record
and
find
all
the
places
that
we
can
find.
we
would
really
like
the
petitioners
to
go
through
two.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
you
are
right,
your
honor.
we
believe
that...
we
believe
actually--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--we
will
give
it
to
you,
your
honor.
in
answer
to
the
question
about
what
the
court
found,
they
did
find
that
there
was
the
agreed
use
of
illegal
violence.
now,
that
is
a
conclusion.
they
said
that
they
had
performed
an
adequate
review
of
the
record,
and
they
dismissed
39
of
the
petitioners.
the
petitioners
put
themselves
in
the
interesting
position
of
saying
that
that
means
they
didn't
search
the
record
because
they
granted
the
petitioners'
motion
to
dismiss
all
of
those
39
people
for
the
reasons
that
the
petitioners
said
to
dismiss
them.
we
don't
think
that
there
should
be
any
such
presumption,
and
we
believe
that
they
searched
the
record.
we
believe
that
if
the
petitioners...
what
the
petitioners
did
was
make
in
essence
a
bare
no
evidence
allegation.
they
said,
all
these...
all
these
people
did
was
encourage
other
people
to
boycott
or
picket,
and
they
listed
people
without
any
reference,
any
record
references.
we
believe
that
what
they
should
have
done
if
they
wanted
to
make
a
case
to
get
this
court
to
overrule
the
lower
court
finding,
was
to
list
every
reference
to
every
petitioner
in
the
record
and
what
it
said,
and
then
to
conclude
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence.
we
will
be
glad
to
do
that.
we
think
they
should
have
done
it
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
that
is
a
basis
for
liability
for
damages.
on
the
question
of
the
conspiracy
theory,
first
of
all,
we
want
to
point
out
that
as
we
think
counsel
has
conceded
here,
no
conspiracy
theory
is
necessary
to
sustain
the
state
court's
judgment
against
the
naacp.
charles
evers
was
liable
for
all
the
tea
on
the
ship.
he
did
participate
in
threats
of
violence.
he
wanted
to
injure
the
business
relations
of
the
respondents
by
constitutionally
unprotected
means--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--that's
right.
no,
but
he
wanted
to
do
it
by
constitutionally
unprotected
means.
you
see,
their
contention
is
that
if
some
people
only
wanted
to
do
it
by
protected
means,
then
if
it
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
have
a
secondary
boycott,
they
are
protected,
and
if
it
is
a
first
amendment
right,
and
if
in
fact
there
were
people
who
were
just
out
there
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights,
then
they
have
got
a
good
case.
but
charles
evers
wasn't
one
of
those
people,
and
charles
evers
was
acting
in
his
capacity
as
field
secretary
of
the
naacp.
even
under
the
statement
that
the
aclu
recommends...
pardon
me,
the
standard
that
the
aclu
recommends
in
their
amicus
brief,
which
is
section
876
of
the
restatement
of
tort
second,
the
joint
tortfeasors
section,
evers
was
a
joint
tort
feasor,
and
evers
was
responsible
for
all
of
the
damage
that
the
people
who
were
participating
in
this
movement
that
he
was
participating
in
did
because
he
took
himself
out
of
the
first
amendment,
and
he
intended
for
people
to
be
injured
in
the
way
that
they
were
injured.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
almost.
of
course
there
was.
the
petitioners
themselves--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--we
don't
think
that
is
a
constitutional
question.
that...
what
they
are--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--well,
yes,
we
do.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
we
think
he
is
liable.
we
think
that
they
are
attempting
here
to
constitutionalize
not
only
the
law
of
conspiracy
but
the
law
of
damages.
they
cite
a
number
of--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--no,
only
what
you
could
prove
in
that
case.
you
see--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--well,
but
what
i
was...
the
reason
that
i
think
there's
a
distinction
is
because
the
rule
of
damages
that
the
state
courts
and
that
courts
routinely
apply
that
also
reflects
the
rule
in
the
restatement
of
torts
is
the
substantial
factor
test.
now,
there
was
only
one
boycott
here.
there
was
one
set
of
damages.
what
you
would
be
requiring
if
you
said
to
the
state
courts,
you
have
to
go
back
and
figure
out
how
much
damage
there
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
violent...
non-violent
and
peaceful
and
voluntary
instead
of
violent
and
coercive,
is,
you
are
asking
the
courts
to
indulge
in
a
hypothetical--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--we
do
not...
we
do
not
agree
that
it
was
substantially
voluntary.
they
use
a
line
in
the
brief
to
say,
well,
most
of
the...
most
of
the
witnesses
testified.
that's--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--well,
according
to
the
labor
cases,
they
cite
a
number
of
statutory
labor
cases--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--i
think
that
in
that
case,
that
if
there
were
a
few
people,
and
if
they
put
on
evidence
that...
if
they
had
put
on
evidence
of
the
amount
of...
the
general
damage
was...
there
was
one
boycott,
there
was
one
corpus
of
damages
that
would
be
very,
very
difficult
to
sever,
and
in
all
the
other
cases
that
we
have
been
able
to
find,
including
the
labor
cases
cited
by
petitioners,
when
that
is
the
case,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
courts
sever
the
damages.
in
the
mead
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
court
says,
the
requirement
that
something
have
contributed
materially
and
substantially
is
enough
to
prevent
windfall
recoveries.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
i
think
it
might
be.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
i
don't
know
what
percentage
i
would
cut
it
off
at.
certainly
10
percent
would
be
on
the
margin.
we
don't
think
that
question
is
really
presented
here.
what
they
really
want
is,
they
want
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
and
say,
even
if
you
find
that
there
was
violence,
and
even
if
you
find
that
certain
petitioners
were
chargeable
with
the
violence,
you
see,
this
is
a
separate
issue,
of
course,
from
can
all
the
petitioners
be
charged,
even
if
you
find
that
a
certain
person
was
chargeable
with
the
injuries
to
business
relations
that
were
caused
by
the
violence,
what
you
want
is,
you
want
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court,
and
you
want
to
ask
them
to
do
not
only
a
hypothetical
head
count
of
what
would
have
happened
if
it
hadn't
been
peaceful
and
voluntary,
you
also
want
them
to
go
over
the
psychological
vectors
within
each
mind
of
each
individual
black
person
in
port
gibson.
there
were
some
people,
and
they
cite
in
their
brief,
they
say,
well,
people
were
afraid
of
having
their
names
called
out,
or
they
basically
agreed
with
the
boycott,
then
the
same
witness
in
another
place
in
his
testimony...
frequently
these
were
the
petitioners
themselves...
they
said,
oh,
yes,
i
was
afraid.
one
of
the
people
who
said
that...
who
the
petitioners
cite
as
having
been
afraid
of
nothing
more
than
having
their
name
called
out
and
being
embarrassed
also
says
that
she
had
heard
that
people
had
been
physically...
she
had
heard
that
they
would
take
your
packages
away
from
you
and
destroy
them,
and
she
didn't
want
that
to
happen
to
her.
so,
you've
got
mixed
motives
on
the
part
of
lots
and
lots
of
people.
i
don't
even
know,
as
they
point
out
with
an
exclamation
point
in
their
reply
brief,
one
of
the
petitioners
himself
bought
a
car
at
a
store.
he
was
encouraging
other
people
to
boycott
and
doing
things
like
that,
but
he
did
buy
a
car
at
a
white-owned
store,
and
his
car
was
destroyed.
so,
i
think
it
would
be
very,
very
difficult,
and
the
rule...
the
petitioners
have
a
very
curious
attitude
toward
labor
cases,
because
when
a
labor
case
construing
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
help
them,
they
say...
they
treat
it
like
it
was
a
first
amendment
case
binding
on
the
states.
on
the
other
hand,
in
a
case
where...
for
instance,
the
ramsey
case,
where
this
court
held
that
you
can
prove
conspiracy,
you
can
prove
an
implied
conspiracy
in
a
labor
context
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
you
can
draw
inferences
from
conduct,
which
is
how
the
conspiracy
was
found
here.
in
that
case,
they
say,
well,
that
is
a
labor
case,
not
a
civil
rights
case.
now,
it
is
exactly
the
other
way.
they've
got
it
exactly
backwards.
when
the
nlra
provides
a
substantive
or
a
procedural
protection
for
labor
unions
that
is
not
required
by
the
first
amendment,
you
can't
use
that
as
though
it
were
a
first
amendment
case,
and
that
is
what
they
try
to
do
on
this
damages
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
when
this
court
holds
that
something
is
permitted,
that
conduct
can
be
penalized
in
a
labor
context,
it
strikes
me
that
the
burden
is
on
the
people
who
are
trying
to
distinguish
that
case
to
come
up
with
a
distinction,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
enough
just
to
say
that
this
is
a
civil
rights
case.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
several
thousand.
i
think
it
was
7,500...
27...
it
has
grown
quite
a
lot,
actually.
it
was
2,700,
and
now
it
is
8,000,
or
something
like
that.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
2,700,
i
think,
is
a...
i
can
check
that
for
you.
i
don't
have
it
right
now.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
their
largest
meetings...
oh,
no,
more
than
that
participated
because
they
were
in
fear.
almost
everyone
participated
because
they
were
in
fear.
i
mean,
very,
very
few
black
people
shopped
at
these
white
stores
during
that
time.
at
first,
there
were
a
lot.
one
of
the...
the
secretary
of
the
naacp,
lesco
guster,
testified
that
at
first
there
were
quite
a
lot
of
boycott
breakers,
and
that
the
list
was
very
long
that
they
called
out,
and
after
a
while
there
were
not
very
many
at
all.
one
of
the...
there
was
a
division
within
the
black
community,
and
we
think
that
is
what
this
really
was
about.
we
think
that
one
group
in
the
black
community...
one
of
the
demands,
for
instance,
was
that
you
had
to
appoint
negroes
to
the
board
of
education,
and
they
had
to
be
negroes
acceptable
to
the
negro
leadership.
many
of
the
black
people
who...
the
black
people
who
did
testify,
who
had
the
courage
to
testify
that...
what
happened
to
them
in
the
trial,
they
had...
they
tended
to
have
philosophical
or
personal
reasons
not
to
want
to
go
along
with
this
other
leadership,
which
happened
to
be
the
leadership
of
the
naacp,
and
it
was
those
people
who
were
primarily
compelled.
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
remaining,
and
i
would
like
to
deal
a
little
bit
more
with
the
conspiracy
issue,
because
i
do
think
that
that
is
a
problem,
although
not
in
terms
of
holding
the
naacp.
agreement
was
inferred
from
conduct
in
this
case.
nobody
testified
that
he
specifically
approved
of
the
violence,
but
those
petitioners
who
were
not
members
of
the
black
hats
organization
saw
the
black
hats
on
the
street.
they
participated
in
weekly
meetings
which
were
the
decision-making
meetings
about
how
the
boycott
was
going
to
be
run.
those
people,
who
were
the
principal
source
or
a
principal
source
according
to
the
trial
court
of
the
pervasive
fear
in
the
community
that
caused
the
success
of
the
boycott
were
the
designated
enforcers
of
the
boycott.
it
seems
to
me
that
after
the
pattern
had
been
established,
after
you
have
seen
enough
times
people
on
the
street
taking
people's
names,
and
sometimes
destroying
their
packages,
and
then
those
names
are
called
out,
and
then
bad
things
happen
to
those
people,
and
you
hear
charles
evers
and
other
boycott
leaders
saying
that
these
people
have
to
be
chastised
and
disciplined
and
whipped
and
taken
care
of,
and
they
are
in
fact
chastised
and
disciplined
and
whipped
and
taken
care
of,
at
some
point
agreement
to
what
is
going
on
can
be
inferred
from
the
conduct
of
somebody
who
has
the
right
and
the
power
to
control
that
activity.
that
is--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--no.
well,
yes,
we
need
to
succeed
on
that
contention,
i
think,
to
hold
many
of
the
91
people.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
not
for
everybody.
well,
evers,
i
think
james
bailey,
who
ruined
the
flower
garden--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--if
our
statement
is
not
right--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--that
you
can
infer
conspiracy
from
agreement,
you
would
have
to
hold
only
those
who
were
shown
personally
to
have
approved
of
the
fear
of
violence
aspect
of
boycott
enforcement,
and
they...
they
are
arguing
for
a
very
high
specific
intent
requirement.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
engaging
in
it
would
obviously
be
the
best
evidence
that
there
would
be,
and
you
would
have
charles
evers
liable,
you
would
have
the
naacp
liable
on
the
respondeat
superior,
the
fact
that
he
was
acting
as
their...
as
their
paid
agent
and
spokesman.
you
would
have,
for
instance,
james
bailey,
the
member
of
the
black
hats
who
destroyed
the
flower
garden.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
james
bailey
testified
that
he
was
a...
this
would
be
evidence
of
his
approval
of
the
pervasive...
of
his
specific
intent
to
damage
the
business
relations
of
the
merchants.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
i
think
that
causation
wouldn't
have
to
depend
on
that
act,
once
you
had
shown
his
intent.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
no,
but
it
would
be
a
joint
feasor
theory.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
joint
with
everyone
else.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
we
know...
we
know
that
these
acts
were
done.
usually
the
way
that
conspiracies
work
is
the
way
that
this
one
worked,
which
is,
people
do
things
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
and
it
is
hard
to
identify
exactly
who
did
them.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
no,
but
he
would
be
liable
also
as
a
joint
tort
feasor,
since
he
had
committed
a
tort
as
part
of
this
movement
with
everybody
else.
he
would
be
liable
for
all
the
damage
that
was
caused
as
part
of
that
campaign
even
for
other
acts
that
he
did
not,
in
which
he
did
not
in
fact
participate.
it
would
not
be
realistic
for
him
to
say,
oh,
well,
i
approved
of
fear
and
violence
as
a
way
of
getting
mrs.
butler
not
to
participate,
but
as
far
as
getting
all
the
other
people
to
participate,
it
would
have
been
very
bad
for
fear
of
violence
to
be
used--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--of
his
intent.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
that
is
even
more
specific
than
i
think--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--it
is
evidence
of
the
fact
that
he
intended
to
injure
the
relations,
he
with
these
others.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
no,
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
conspiracy
theory.
that
is
why
i
was
reluctant
to...
i
couldn't
react
very
well
to
justice--
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
--well,
the
illustration
that
the
restatement
of
torts
gives,
for
instance,
is
that
five
people
go
into
a
house,
and
one
of
them
does
one
tortious
thing,
and
they
all
do
five
different
tortious
things.
you
don't
need
to
prove
that
they
sat
down
in
a
room
and
agreed
that
they
were
all
going
to
do
them.
that
is,
i
guess,
a
kind
of
conspiracy
theory,
using
the
word
generically,
but
it
is
not
covered
by
the
law
of
conspiracy,
and
the
aclu,
for
instance,
who
don't
like
conspiracy
theories
at
all,
recommend
that
as
the
rule
that
this
court
ought
to
apply
to
joint
tortfeasors.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
well,
i
was...
i
was
hypothesizing
that
they
did
five
different
things.
one
destroyed
one
piece
of
property,
and
one...
i
think
they
say
a
chokes
somebody,
and
b
ties
him
up,
and
c
steals
something,
and
d
destroys
something.
they
would
be
different
items
of
damages,
but
that
would
be
sufficient
evidence
that
there
was
a
common
plan.
mr.
grover
rees,
iii
thank
you.
