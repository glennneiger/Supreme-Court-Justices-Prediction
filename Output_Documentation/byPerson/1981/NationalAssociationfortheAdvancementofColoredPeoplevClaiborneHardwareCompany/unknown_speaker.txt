unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
by
that,
mr.
cutler,
that
any
damage
factor
particularly
should
be
focused
on
the
particular
individuals
identified
as
connected
with
violence?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
the
particular
acts,
when
and
if
identified--
unknown
speaker
--must
be
shown
to
have
had
this
consequence
on
the
business
losses.
unknown
speaker
on
that,
mr.
cutler,
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
say
that
you
had
waived
that
point
by
failing
to
argue
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
contend
you
did
argue
the
merits
of
the
injunction
in
the
supreme--
unknown
speaker
--was
there
ambiguity
the
first
time?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
cutler,
that
you
are
saying
that
a
secondary
consequence
is
not
an
adequate
basis
for
recovery,
that
is,
that
this
man
who
committed
this
violent
act
on
the
local
resident
in
order
to
persuade
her
or
force
her
into
refusing
to
deal,
that
kind
of
a
secondary
consequence
is
not
to
be
a
basis
for
recovery.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
then
relating
it
to
this
particular
episode,
that
would
mean
only
the
loss
of
the
custom
of
this
particular
woman
whose
garden
was
damaged.
unknown
speaker
that
evidence
is
undisputed?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
whatever
the
effort
was
to
persuade
her--
unknown
speaker
--the
record
shows
it
did
not
succeed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gilmore,
was...
rather,
mr.
cutler,
wasn't
the
gilmore
shooting
incident
identified
with
one
of
three
of
the
petitioners?
unknown
speaker
taking
up
your
analogy
to
the
boston
tea
party,
if
the
london
merchants
could
identify
only
one
of
the
members
of
the
boston
tea
party,
but
did
identify
him,
and
demonstrated
that
he
had
damaged
one
case
of
tea,
could
he
be
held,
in
your
view,
responsible
for
all
the
loss
of
tea?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cutler,
how
about
the
threats
of
violence,
if
you
trade
with
these
stores,
i
will
break
your
neck,
or
beat
you
up,
or
whatever
it
is?
unknown
speaker
did
the
courts,
state
courts
find
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
so
the
courts
didn't
agree
with--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
made
a
finding
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
as
much
of
a
finding
as
yours
is.
if
theirs
is
a
conclusion,
yours
is,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
argument
is,
though,
that
just
on
the
record
their
conclusion
is
unsupportable.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
what
extent
on
a
purely
factual
issue
should
we
go
beyond
the
findings
of
two
courts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cutler,
what
do
you
suppose
our
standards
for
reviewing
this
constitutional
fact
should
be?
should
it
be
clearly
erroneous,
or
we
arrive
at
an
independent
judgment
of
the
record,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
independent
judgment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cutler,
with
reference
to
the
timing
that
you
seem
to
emphasize
so
much,
is
it
not
true
that
whether
we
look
at
the
boston
tea
party,
or
prolonged
picketing
in
a
union-employer
conflict,
or
a
situation
like
this,
that
there
needs
to
be
frequent
exhortation
by
those
sponsoring
the
boycott,
the
picketing,
in
order
to
keep
it
going?
isn't
that
a
perfectly
normal
part
of
the
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
focusing...
wanted
you
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
some
of
these
people
heard
about
these
statements
of
mr.
evers,
and
some
did
not,
and
some
heard
of
them
long
afterwards.
there
must
have
been
a
number
of
exhortations,
including
those
in
the
record
and
many
outside
the
record,
to
keep
a
boycott
alive.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
is
a
first
amendment
right.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
rees.
is
it
a
dispute
about
the
facts
or
about
the
meaning
of
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
finding
about
how
many
people
heard
about
the
field
secretary's
statements?
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
find?
what
did
they
find--
unknown
speaker
--about
the
impact
of
mr.
evers'
statements?
unknown
speaker
could
you
refer...
are
you
reading
from
something?
unknown
speaker
what
page
of
the
record?
unknown
speaker
okay,
that's
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
rees,
is
it
correct,
though,
that
at
least
one
of
those
two
statements
was
in
1969?
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
the
one
in
1969?
unknown
speaker
for
what?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
take
the
view
that
that
was
enough?
under
the
district
court's
theory
of
the
case,
as
i
understood
it,
that
would
have
been
enough,
that
fear
of
denunciation
and
abuse
of
that
kind
would
have
been
enough
to...
all
that
they
had
to
prove.
unknown
speaker
so
the
district
court
did
not
have
to
connect
the
violence,
did
not
have
to
prove
fear
of
violence
in
order
to
sustain
the
judgment
of--
unknown
speaker
--does
the
1969
statement...
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
rely
on
the
1969
statement
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position
that
by
whatever
means,
a
boycott
involves
the
sponsors
of
the
boycott
putting
fear
into
some
people
as
a
predicate
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
even
though
not
violent?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
said,
unquestionably,
the
word
got
around
that
physical
harm
as
well
as
vilification
and
ostracism
could
very
well
be
the
lot
of
any
black
person.
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel,
counsel,
that
there
is
specific
evidence
tying
each
one
of
these
remaining
defendants
to
these
particular
incidents?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking...
that
isn't
what
i
asked.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
whether
you
feel
there
is
specific
evidence
that
ties
each
one
of
these
incidents
to
these
particular
remaining
defendants.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
that
maybe
i
will
take
you
up
on
your
suggestion
that
you
file
a
reply
brief
pointing
out
where
in
this
voluminous
record
such
evidence
is
present.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
state
courts
find
that
to
be
the
case,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
expressly
tie
each
incident--
unknown
speaker
--to
each
of
the
named
people
who
were--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
is
what
you
are
being
asked
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
is
a
substantial
task,
but
i
think
it
is
counsel's
task,
not
this
court's
task.
unknown
speaker
so
far,
i
get
nothing
but
generalities
from
your
mississippi
courts
and
from
your
brief,
and
i
would
like
something
specific.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your...
the
theory
of
your
case
that
if
concerted
action
was
taken
which
in
fact
puts
certain
identified
people
in
fear
and
apprehension
if
they
traded
with
these
stores,
that
that
is
the
basis
for
liability
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
whole
object.
that
was
the
whole
object
of
the
boycott,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rees,
may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question
on
that
point?
do
you
concede
that
there
was
some
voluntary
participation
in
the
boycott,
or
do
you
deny
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
mr.
evers
is
liable
for
the
business
damage
caused
by
the
voluntary
participation
in
the
boycott?
unknown
speaker
that
is
hardly
an
answer
to
my
question.
unknown
speaker
you
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
just
push
it
to
the
extreme.
supposing
there
were
1,000
people
who
participated
in
the
boycott
and
refused
to
purchase
anything.
one
of
those
persons
refused
because
he
was
afraid
his
neck
would
be
broken.
the
other
999
all
say,
i
would
have
done
it
no
matter
what
mr.
evers
says,
because
i
believe
in
the
objectives
of
the
boycott.
for
how
much
would
he
be
liable,
the
whole
1,000?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
said
he
would
be
reliable
for
the
voluntary
participation
as
well.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
that
is
not
fair,
because
you
admit
it
was
partially
voluntary.
you
are
not
saying,
if
it
were
one
or
the
other.
i
think
you
have
said
on
your
own
presentation
to
us
that
it
was
partially
caused
by
violence
and
partially
by
voluntary
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
it
is
substantially
violent.
are
they
nevertheless
liable
then
for
the
voluntary--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
really
want
to
know
the
theory,
you
understand
what
the
theory
of
the
court
below
was.
unknown
speaker
so
if
it
is
10
percent
caused
by
violence
and
90
percent
voluntarily,
i
suppose
10
percent
is
substantial
and
material,
then
they
are
100
percent
liable.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
your--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
take
you
back
to
a
factual
question.
what
is
the
population
of
this
town?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
the
time
of
these
events.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
trying
to
get
the
proportion
of
people
who
participated
in
this
thing.
you
said
very
few,
but
very
effectively,
but
i
think
you
also
said
there
were
50
or
60
of
these
so-called
black
hats,
the
monitors,
the--
--there
were
several
hundred
people
who
participated
in
the
boycott.
there
was
evidence
of
deep
division
within
the
black
community.
you
mean
participating
militantly
or
because
they
were
put
in
fear,
as
you--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
need
to
succeed
on
this
submission
to
hold
any
of
the
people
against
whom
judgment
was
entered?
unknown
speaker
for
everybody
except
evers,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
everybody
except
the
naacp,
or
the
naacp
and
evers?
unknown
speaker
about
the
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
well,
anybody
who
actually
engaged
in
violent
conduct.
unknown
speaker
but
just
take
bailey
for
a
minute.
what
evidence
is
there
that
that
caused
any
loss
of
patronage
to
anybody?
i
understood
that
the
woman
whose
garden
was
trampled
went
ahead
and
continued
to
buy
from
the
stores
in
question,
and
that
no
one
else
knew
about
it.
so
how
would
that
incident
prove
any
liability?
unknown
speaker
supposing
he
had
that
intent,
but
did
he
in
fact
cause
any
damage
by
trampling
this
garden?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
hold
him
liable
absent
a
conspiracy
theory,
i
thought
you
were
saying.
unknown
speaker
joint
with
whom?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
a
two-man
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
but
here
we
know
what
happened.
he
admitted
it.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
that
is
just
evidence,
could
be
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--that
he
sat
down
with
evers
and
they
both
agreed,
here's
our
plan,
and
let's
use
violence
as
much
as
necessary.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
it
is
evidence.
it
is
evidence
of--
unknown
speaker
--but
as
soon
as
you
say
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
back
to
your
conspiracy
theory,
and
i
thought
you
had
said
you
didn't
need
the
conspiracy
theory
as
to
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
joint
tort
if
it
is
not
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
your
example
is,
five
people
jointly
destroyed
some
property.
here
one
man
jointly
destroyed...
singly
destroyed
a
flower
garden.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cutler--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
or
two?
mr.
chief
justice?
unknown
speaker
does
the
first
amendment
principle
on
which
you
rely
apply
to
any
group
that
engaged
in
this
sort
of
activity?
there
was
some
suggestion
that
you
were
arguing
that
it
applied
only
to
a
civil
rights
boycott.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cutler,
how
about
a
labor
boycott?
would
you
apply
the
same
principle?
unknown
speaker
a
secondary
boycott?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cutler,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
whether
this
is
or
is
not
a
secondary
or
primary
boycott?
unknown
speaker
that
was
my
understanding.
but
you
would
apply
the
same
principle
to
any
group
asserting
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
practical
question
as
a
lawyer.
let's
assume
a
case
you
had
about
100
people
who
picketed
a
store
for
a
week,
and
there
were,
say,
three
acts
of
violence
during
that
period.
you
could
identify
those
three
people.
the
store
did
no
business
for
a
week.
how
would
you
go
about
proving
that
even
the
three
who
engaged
in
acts
of
violence
caused
any
loss
of
business?
unknown
speaker
yes.
you
identify
three
people
in
the
course
of
a
week,
there
were
three
acts
of
violence.
obviously,
you
wouldn't
want
to
hold
innocent
people
liable.
but
would
there
ever
be
any
recourse,
provable
recourse?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
were
$100,000
worth
of
damage,
x
percent
of
it
could
be
assigned
to
those
three
people?
