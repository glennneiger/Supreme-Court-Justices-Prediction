mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
a
series
of
decisions
going
back
at
least
a
century,
this
court
has
recognized
the
basic
principles
that
we
believe
control
the
case
here
this
morning.
for
example,
in
1875,
the
court
stated
in
minor
against
happersett,
"necessarily,
the
members
of
the
legislature
are
elected
by
the
voters
of
the
state.
"
in
1964,
in
the
landmark
case
of
reynolds
against
sims,
the
court
said,
"representative
government
is
in
essence
self-government
through
the
medium
of
elected
representatives
of
the
people.
"
and
then,
in
one
of
the
many,
many
cases
applying
the
reynolds
versus
sims
principle,
the
court
said
in
1969
in
kramer
versus
the
union
free
school
district,
"the
right
to
vote
establishes
the
legitimacy
of
representative
government.
"
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
they
do
stand
for
more
than
that,
justice
rehnquist,
although
since
puerto
rico
has
recognized
the
right
to
vote
for
its
legislature,
it
might
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
go
no
further
than
to
apply
those
principles,
but
we
contend
that
the
principles
that
this
court
has
already
recognized
demonstrate
that
there
is
an
absolute
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
states
and
by
virtue
of
the
compact
between
puerto
rico
and
the
united
states
on
people
of
puerto
rico
to
provide
for
an
elected
legislature.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
as
we
have
tried
to
explain
in
our
brief,
justice
rehnquist,
the
obligation
to
provide
for
an
elected
state
legislature
appears
from
at
least
two
provisions
of
the
constitution.
one,
of
course,
is
article
i,
section
2,
which
necessarily
assumes
that
state
legislatures
are
elected,
since
it
provides
that
the
electors
for
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
must
be
the
same
as
those
who
are
the
electors
for
the
state
legislature.
in
explaining
that
clause
and
other
similar
assumptions
underlying
the
union
of
states
that
was
forged
in
the
constitution,
james
madison
and
the
other
authors
of
the
federalist
papers
treated
it
as
a
fundamental
given
that
the
union
being
established
under
the
constitution
was
a
union
of
states
with
a
republican
form
of
government,
and
that
a
republican
form
of
government
included
elected
legislatures.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
originally,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
provisions
of
article
i,
section
3,
called
for
the
appointment
of
all
united
states
senators
by
the
legislatures.
there
was
no
popular
election.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
has
changed.
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
provides
for
direct
election
of
senators,
but
recognizing
the
historical
tradition
of
having
appointed
legislators,
the
seventeenth
amendment
provides
that
governors
may
make
temporary
appointments,
but
the
seventeenth
amendment,
quite
consistent
with
the
tradition
on
which
we
are
relying,
insists
that
the
temporary
appointment
by
the
governor
may
last
only
until
the
people,
as
the
amendment
says,
have
the
power,
the
opportunity
to
elect
a
successor.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
is
one
case
in
which
the...
a
lower
court
found
that
a
delay
of
over
two
years
was
temporary,
but
the
court
emphasized
that
the
amendment
recognizes
the
right
of
the
people
to
elect
the
senator,
and
the
court
specifically
said
it
would
not
be
able
to
sustain
a
statute
like
the
one
here
by
which
the
governor
was
authorized
to
appoint
a
substitute
senator
for
the
full
balance
of
the
term.
of
course,
what
we
have
here
before
the
court
is
a
statute
similar
to
the
one
adopted
in
a
minority
of
states
that
permits
appointment
to
fill
the
balance
of
a
legislative
term.
we
think
that
that
approach
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
right
of
representative
government,
which
is
recognized
in
article
i,
is
specifically
enforced
in
article
iv,
the
republican
form
of
government
clause,
and
if
further
support
would
be
needed,
several
other
courts
have
suggested
that
the
right
to
vote
at
least
for
state
legislative
office,
and
that
is
all
this
case
involves,
can
also
be
inferred
from
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment,
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--going
back
150
years,
in
luther
against
borden,
the
court
suggested
that
in
some
circumstances
a
guarantee
clause
claim
might
be
non-justiciable,
but
as
justice
brennan's
opinion
for
the
court
in
baker
against
carr
explained
in
considerable
detail,
the
fact
that
certain
claims
under
the
republican
form
of
government
clause
might
not
be
justiciable
does
not
mean
that
any
claim
under
that
clause
is
non-justiciable,
particularly
when
the
fundamental
core
of
the
republican
form
of
government
is
at
issue,
and
i
submit
that
is
what
we
have
here,
or
when
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
give
explicit
guidance
to
the
court
on
the
content
of
the
republican
form
of
government,
and
here,
both
the
text
of
the
constitution
and
the
history
before,
during,
and
after
the
debates
on
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
leave,
i
submit,
no
room
to
doubt
that
the
bedrock
organization
established
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
a
union
of
states
governed
by
elected
legislatures.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
as
i
was
suggesting
a
moment
ago
to
justice
rehnquist,
since
puerto
rico
has
in
fact
extended
the
right
to
vote
for
its
legislature,
we
suggest
that
that
was
not
a
free
choice,
but
a
matter
of
constitutional
obligation,
one
that
congress,
of
course,
specifically
enforced
in
the
compact.
one
could
approach
this
case
as
a
simple
equal
protection
clause
case.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
one
can
go
back
still
another
step,
justice
white.
the
system
that
puerto
rico
has
actually
chosen
for
filling
vacancies
is
one
in
which
the
political
party
makes
the
direct
selection.
that
system,
we
believe,
is
invalid
on
first
amendment
freedom
of
association
grounds.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
you
could
certainly
do
that
in
the
exercise--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--normally
you
would,
justice
white.
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
sketch
the
full
context
of
this
case
in
order
to
place
it
in
historical
perspective.
the
party
appointment
system
we
think
is
facially
invalid
under
the
first
amendment
as
well
as
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
but
that
conclusion,
i
believe,
becomes
all
the
more
compelling
when
the
court
appreciates
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
just
a
discriminatory
system
in
handling
some
political
venture
or
some
governmental
function.
we
are
talking
about
a
discriminatory
system
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
representative
government
under
the
constitution.
the
survey
that
i
tried
to
outline
in
our
brief
to
explain
why
the
constitution
requires
an
elected
legislature
i
think
implies
that
when
vacancies
occur
in
the
legislatures
exercising
general
statewide
lawmaking
power,
the
people
have
a
continuing
right
to
have
their
voice
heard
in
selecting
the
legislators
who
will
make
the
policies
that
will
govern
their
lives.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
implicit
in
the
text
of
the
constitution,
but
this
is
another
of
those
examples
in
which
a
page
of
history
may
be
worth
more
than
a
volume
of
logic.
as
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief,
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
it
had
been
for
centuries
the
british
tradition
to
replace
vacancies
in
the
house
of
commons
through
a
bi-election.
it
beggars
the
imagination,
i
suggest,
to
conclude
that
the
colonists
who
fought
and
made
a
revolution
were
intending
to
establish
a
form
of
government
where
the
people
would
have
fever
electoral
rights
than
did
their
cousins
in
england.
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
every
one
of
the
states
that
provided
for
filling
vacancies
in
their
state
legislatures,
even
at
a
time
when
elections
were
held
annually,
provided
for
filling
those
vacancies
through
a
bi-election.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
seventeenth
amendment
is
explicit
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
it
was.
the
court
that
upheld
the
29-month
vacancy
in
the
new
york...
the
appointment
of
a
senator
from
new
york
noted
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
giving
the
governor
power
to
make
a
temporary
appointment
pending
the
holding
of
an
election
was
that
holding
statewide
elections
for
the
united
states
senate
would
be
costly,
but
what
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
the
seventeenth
amendment
is
of
a
piece
with
article
i
in
providing
that
there
must
be
a
bi-election
for
members
of
the
united
states
senate,
just
as
for
members
of
the
house
of
representatives.
all
the
seventeenth
amendment
does
is
authorize
the
governor
to
make
a
temporary
appointment
until
the
machinery
for
setting
up
a
bi-election
can
be
put
into
place,
and
that
same
court
was
quite
explicit
in
saying
that
the
court
would
not
sustain
under
the
seventeenth
amendment
a
statute
that
authorized
the
governor
to
appoint
a
substitute
senator
for
the
full
balance
of
the
term.
so,
the
tradition
that
both
article
i
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
codified
is
the
tradition,
what
i
would
consider
a
basic
constitutional
presumption
of
our
form
of
government,
that
the
people
have
the
right
to
select
their
legislative
representatives
even
though
there
might
be
some
cost
or
burden
involved.
of
course,
as
i
will
explain
in
a
few
moments,
the
cost,
the
burden,
the
inconvenience
that
can
be
talked
about
in
this
case
are
minuscule
in
comparison
with
the
burden
that
the
seventeenth
amendment
expressly
requires
the
states
to
shoulder
in
electing
substitute
senators.
we
are
talking
here
only
about
a
single
district
vacancy,
a
vacancy
that
arises,
as
this
record
shows,
quite
infrequently.
the
implication
in
the
constitution
that
the
people
have
the
right
to
select
their
legislators
is,
i
think,
fundamental.
that
carries
us
through,
i
submit,
the
right
of
the
people
to
select
their
legislators
even
when
a
vacancy
occurs.
this
is
a
continuing
rights,
something
that
is
not
lost
simply
because
of
the
happenstance
occurrence
of
death
or
resignation.
legislators
are,
after
all,
elected
by
the
people
to
be
their
spokesmen,
their
representatives
in
making
government
policy.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
any
system
that
at
least
in
the
absence
of
compelling
justification
authorizes
the
appointment
of
a
substitute
legislator
fails
to
comply
with
various
provisions,
explicit
and
implicit,
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
the
seventeenth
amendment
would
not
affect
the
provisions
of
state
legislatures.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
applies
only,
of
course,
to
the
federal
legislature.
the
powers
of
the
state
to
provide
for
an
appointed
state
senate
today
or
originally,
i
think,
are
outside
the
contours
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
historically,
justice
rehnquist,
the
states
did
provide
for
appointed
upper
houses.
they
were
more
in
the
nature
of
executive
councils,
rather
than
popular
chambers,
and
since
in
minor
against
happersett
this
court
said
that
the
situation
as
of
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
gives
us
the
best
glimpse
of
what
the
framers
meant
when
they
spoke
about
a
republican
form
of
government,
my
answer
would
be,
apart
from
later
constitutional
amendments,
a
state
at
that
time
could
have
provided
for
an
appointed
upper
house,
but
had
to
provide,
as
it
still
must
provide,
for
an
elected,
a
popularly
elected
lower
house.
that
was
the
common
pattern
of
all
of
the
states
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
ratified.
if
you
will,
that
was
a
parallel
reflecting
the
dichotomy
between
the
house
of
lords
and
the
house
of
commons.
but
what
we
have
here
today
is
a
state
lower
legislative
house
that
is
made
by
statute
and
constitutional
provision
a
popularly
elected
chamber.
we
believe
that
is
a
constitutional
imperative
that
puerto
rico
has
recognized,
and
that
vacancies
in
it
must
be
filled
by
the
same
electoral
process.
justice
white
a
few
moments
ago
asked
about
alternate
grounds
for
the
relief
being
sought
in
this
case.
the
first
amendment
is
a
clear
one.
puerto
rico,
like
a
small
minority
of
states,
has
adopted
a
theory
of
party
ownership
which
was
expressly
upheld
against
federal
constitutional
challenge
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico.
under
this
notion,
the
seat
in
the
legislature
belongs
not
to
the
people
indeed
perhaps
not
even
to
the
candidate
whom
the
people
elected,
but
to
the
party
on
whose
ticket
the
candidate
won.
that
concept
seems
facially
inconsistent
with
our
notions
of
representative
government,
both
as
a
matter
of
practice
as
well
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
theory.
legislators
are
elected
by
the
people,
not
by
parties.
they
represent
people,
the
voters
of
their
districts,
not
parties.
a
system
of
this
sort
is--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--the
logic--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--well,
that
is
a
difficulty
that
i
have
had
with
the
justifications
for
the
party
ownership
system,
justice
stevens.
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
said
that
there
are
several...
it
termed
them
compelling
justifications
for
this
party
ownership
system.
one
was
that
the
party
be
able
to
preserve
its
electoral
balance.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
rationale
does.
it
has
not
been
applied
in
its
most
extreme
form.
indeed,
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
i
wanted
to
make.
if
this
rationale
justified
the
party's
ownership
of
the
seat
when
a
vacancy
arises,
because
it
is
necessary
for
the
party
to
retain
a
particular
level
of
balance
in
the
legislature,
or
to
carry
out
its
electoral
mandate,
the
party
ownership
rationale
would
similarly
be
offended
if
a
legislator
decided
he
wanted
to
break
ranks
with
his
party
and
vote
against
its
platform,
or
decided,
as
one
of
the
appendices
to
our
brief
shows,
if
the
legislator
actually
decided
to
change
parties
after
election,
these
perfectly--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--well,
i
think
i
wouldn't
frame
the
alternative
to
party
appointment
as
governor
ownership
either.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
premises
that
were
given,
justice
stevens,
for
party
ownership
i
think
suggest
that
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
takes
this
principle
seriously.
this
is
not
just
a
label
attached.
the
reasons
for
giving
the
party
rather
than
some
elected
official
the
power
to
fill
the
vacancy
or
that
the
party
has
a
right
to
a
certain
quantum
of
political
support
in
the
legislature,
regardless
of
whether
the
people
or
anyone
else
would
choose
someone
of
the
same
party
to
fill
that
vacancy,
so
there
is
not
a
necessary
overlap
between
the
label
and
the
consequences,
but
the
rationale
that
was
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
seems
to
me
to
carry
us
to
that
point.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
on
the
contrary,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
seventeenth
amendment
supports
our
position
for
two
reasons.
one,
it
recognizes
the
basic
proposition
that
we
are
arguing,
that
is,
that
there
must
be
an
election
to
fill
a
vacancy
even
in
the
senate.
there
can
be
a
temporary
appointment,
but
ultimately
there
has
to
be
a
bi-election.
the
puerto
rico
statute
makes
no
such
provision.
the
appointment
here
is
for
the
full
balance.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
absolutely
not.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
am
trying
to
respond,
justice
marshal,
to
some
questions
about
the
seventeenth
amendment.
to
the
extent
that
one
of
the
assumptions
of
the
seventeenth
amendment
is
applicable
here
at
all
is
the
assumption
that
there
has
to
be
a
bi-election,
but
by
its
terms
it
applies
only
to
selecting
replacement
members
of
the
united
states
senate.
that
is
not
one
of
the
principal
constitutional
provisions
on
which
we
rely.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no...
well,
the
seventeenth
amendment
was
necessary,
justice
stevens,
because
article
i.
section
3,
of
the
constitution
provides
for...
provided
for
direct
legislative
appointments
of
senators.
the
state
legislatures
appointed
senators.
there
was
no
popular
involvement
at
all.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
some
states...
some
states
had
provided
that
they
would
abide
by
the
judgment
of
the
electorate,
but
the
constitutional
power
to
appoint,
up
until
the
seventeenth
amendment,
remained
vested
in
the
legislatures,
and
the
official
act
that
brought
a
senator
to
washington
was
not
the
choice
of
the
people,
but
the
action
of
the
legislature.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
many
of
them
did,
and
the
purpose
of
the
seventeenth
amendment
was
to
make
sure
that
all
the
states
recognized
the
importance
of
popular
sovereignty.
again,
that
legislative
history
is
traced
briefly
in
our
opening
brief,
and
its
relevance,
justice
marshal,
is
simply
that
it
reflects
the
latest
in
what
we
think
is
correctly
unbroken
recognition
that
at
the
federal
level
as
well
as
at
the
state
level
legislatures
must
be
popularly
elected.
that
is
their
basic
function,
to
serve
as
the
representative
branch
of
government.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
that's
correct.
it
parallels
what
article
i,
section
2,
provides
for
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
the
seventeenth
amendment
has
its
own
text,
but
the
procedure
for
popular
election
is
essentially
the
same
as
for
selection
of
replacement
members
of
the
house
of
representatives.
article
i,
section
2,
provides
that
in
the
event
of
a
vacancy
in
the
house,
the
executive,
the
governor,
must
issue
writs
of
election,
regardless
of
how
short
a
time
remains.
the
first
amendment
points
are
outlined
in
our
brief.
the
basic
question
that
i
think
this
case
comes
down
to
is
whether
there
are
any
compelling
justifications
for
the
party
appointment
system
that
puerto
rico
and
a
few
other
states
have
adopted.
the
pdp
suggests
in
its
brief
before
this
court
that
this
system
is
necessary
to
preserve
puerto
rico's
system
for
minority
representation.
i
submit
that
the
court
should
brush
aside
that
argument
summarily.
it
was
not
argued
below,
for
the
simple
reason
that
as
the
text
of
the
puerto
rico
constitution
and
its
supporting
legislative
history
makes
clear,
puerto
rico's
protection
of
minority
representation
comes
about
through
its
rather
complex
provisions
for
at-large
seats.
the
seat
here
in
question
is
a
district
seat
that
belongs
to
the
candidate
who
is
elected
by
the
majority
of
the
members
of
that
district,
the
majority
of
the
voters.
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
did
not
say
a
word
in
justifying
the
party
appointment
system
about
any
connection
between
it
and
minority
representation,
so
i
suggest
that
that
issue
is
not
one
that
the
court
need
look
to
in
examining
the
justifications
for
this
statute.
the
basic
justifications
offered
by
the
court
below
were
that
party
ownership
avoids
the
necessity
for
quadrennial
elections
by
allowing
appointment
to
fill
vacancies.
that
argument,
i
suggest,
is
equally
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
a
seat
belongs
to
the
members
of
the
public,
to
the
voters.
this
hostility
toward
electoral
campaigning
is
out
of
phase
with
this
court's
own
decisions
on
the
first
amendment.
if
the
people
of
a
district
feel
strongly
enough
about
the
political
issues
that
are
before
their
legislature,
to
want
to
campaign,
to
want
to
discuss
intensely,
far
from
providing
a
justification
for
suppressing
an
electoral
opportunity,
that
seems
to
me
to
provide
a
very
dramatic
reason
for
giving
the
people
an
opportunity
to
express
their
preference
through
the
ballot
box.
if
the
concern
here
is
about
cost,
the
chief
justice's
opinion
for
the
court
in
bullock
against
carter
seems
to
be
a
full
answer.
there,
the
court
struck
down
a
system
in
which
candidates
in
primary
elections
were
required
to
finance
those
primaries
in
order
to
save
the
state
money.
the
opinion
for
the
court
pointed
out
quite
soundly,
in
all
the
programs
in
which
governments
spend
money,
any
sensible
ordering
of
constitutional
priorities
has
to
put
the
funding
of
the
electoral
process
at
the
very
top
of
the
list
of
priorities.
that
rationale
applies
here.
moreover,
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
an
episodic,
an
infrequent
event.
in
the
last
30
years
since
1952,
the
record
shows
that
there
have
been
only
eight
opportunities
for
vacancies
to
be
filled
in
district
seats
in
the
puerto
rico
house
and
senate,
approximately
one
every
four
years,
and
these
are
seats
in
narrowly
defined
territories
with
only
a
few
thousand
voters,
perhaps
one-tenth
the
number
of
voters
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
for
example.
it
is,
i
submit,
inconsistent
with
the
sound
notion
of
constitutional
principle
and
representative
government
to
dispense
with
the
holding
of
a
bi-election
on
any
of
the
grounds
asserted
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
have
just
a
few
brief
comments
by
way
of
reply
to
my
learned
colleagues's
arguments.
first,
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
puerto
rico's
political
status,
its
affiliation
with
the
united
states,
means
that
the
constitutional
principles
that
apply
to
the
states
do
not
apply
to
puerto
rico
to
the
same
extent
is
a
proposition
that
this
court
has
rejected
three
times
in
the
last
six
terms
by
overwhelming
majorities
of
the
court.
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief.
whatever
the
court
decides
today
necessarily
affects
not
only
puerto
rico
but
those
states
that
have
systems
comparable
to
puerto
rico's.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
history,
puerto
rico
has
provided
for
an
elected
legislature
since
the
organic,
the
jeforacher
act
of
1900,
and
since
1902
there
was
provision
for
holding
popular
bi-elections
to
fill
vacancies
in
the
legislature.
the
system
of
party
appointment
in
other
offices
other
than
the
house
of
delegates
of
puerto
rico
was
not
adopted
until
1938.
so,
for
almost
all
of
the
period
from
the
acquisition
of
puerto
rico
from
spain
up
until
the
present,
congress
and
the
legislature
of
puerto
rico
recognize
the
importance
of
popular
bi-elections.
finally,
with
respect
to
party
appointment,
i
agree
with
my
learned
colleague
that
political
parties
are
important,
in
puerto
rico
as
elsewhere.
they
have
constitutional
status.
but
as
this
court's
decisions
shown,
political
parties
have
constitutional
status
because
they
are
private
associations.
that
is
why
they
are
protected
against
government
interference
by
the
first
amendment.
it
stands
those
principles
on
their
heads,
i
submit,
to
say
that
a
kind
of
institution
that
has
constitutional
status
because
of
its
private
nature
may
be
given
the
ownership
of
public
office,
the
legislative
office.
the
judgement
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
