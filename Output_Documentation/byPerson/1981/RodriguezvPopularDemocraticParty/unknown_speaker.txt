unknown
speaker
well,
counsel,
are
you
suggesting
that
those
cases
stand
for
any
more
than
the
proposition
that
where
once
a
right
to
vote
is
accorded,
it
has
to
be
afforded
in
a
non-discriminatory
manner?
unknown
speaker
what
provision
of
the
constitution
gives
rise
to
that
duty?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
explain
that
in
many
instances
when
a
senator,
united
states
senator
dies
or
leaves
office
by
resignation,
the
governor
is
empowered
in
many
instances
to
appoint
his
successor
until
the
next
election?
now,
he
is
not
elected
by
the
people,
then,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
that
has
changed.
unknown
speaker
that
might
be
as
much
as
two
years,
or
lacking
a
day
or
two,
two
years,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
haven't
we
held
that
article
iv
is
a
political
question?
unknown
speaker
must
you
win
on
this
basic
proposition
to
prevail
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
must
you
win
on
this
narrow
proposition
to
prevail?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
were,
wouldn't
ordinarily
we
take
the
narrowest
possible
resolution,
and
not
reach
some
of
these
broader
questions
you
are
arguing?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
be
more
proper
for
us
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
united
states
senate
vacancies
that
occur
during
the
term,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
governs
the
method
by
which
the
successor
is
to
be
selected?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
it
possible
that
one
of
the
considerations
also
is
that
to
hold
a
bi-election
for
a
senator
on
the
part
of
the
state...
i
am
talking
now
about
the
considerations
that
went
into
that
provision,
that
it
would
cost
a
great
deal
more
money
to
hold
a
statewide
election,
bi-election,
than
a
district
election?
is
that
a
factor
that
perhaps
entered
into
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
seventeenth
amendment,
a
state
could
have
provided
in
a
bicameral
legislature
for
an
upper
house
whose
members
were
each
appointed,
say,
by
the
supervisors
of
one
county
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
answer
to
the
question?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
suggestion
that
the
seat
would
not
even
be
owned
by
the
candidate.
unknown
speaker
while
he
is
occupying
it,
he
surely
is
the
only
one
who
has
title
to
it,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
"party
ownership"
rationale
apply
to
anything
except
filling
the
vacancy?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
one
could
say
in
a
state
where
a
governor
can
fill
a
vacancy,
one
could
says,
well,
the
governor
owns
the
seat
in
the
same
sense,
but
that
would
not
mean
that
the
legislator
while
he
is
in
office
is
owned
by
the
governor,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
just
a
question
of
language,
whether
you
call
it
party
ownership
where
a
party
has
the
right
to
fill
the
vacancy?
it
is
just...
may
be
unfortunate
language,
but
does
it
really
mean
anything?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
there
is
something
inherently
un-american,
undemocratic
about
this
idea.
is
that
not
balanced
by
what
the
constitutional,
the
seventeenth
amendment
expressly
authorized
with
reference
to
united
states
senators?
there
is
nothing
un-american
about
that,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
does
the
seventeenth
amendment
apply
to
any
person
other
than
a
senator
or
any
office
other
than
the
u.s.
senate?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
this
case?
you
keep
bringing
it
up.
unknown
speaker
but
if
your
basic
theory
was
correct,
we
probably
didn't
even
need
the
seventeenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
right.
perhaps
i
should
say,
we
didn't
need
the...
well,
i
understand
your
point.
yes.
well,
there
were
direct
elections
of
senators
long
before
the
seventeenth
amendment.
it
was
up
to
the
states,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
had
passed
a
statute
saying
that
we
are
going
to
abide
by
the
result
of
an
election,
presumably
the
consequences
were
the
same
as
if
they
simply
provided
for
an
election
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
way
you
read
it.
the
way
i
read
it
is
that
they
decided
that
as
for
the
senate,
this
is
the
way
it
is
to
be
done,
in
the
senate.
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
seventeenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
say
so.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
your
history
makes
me
wonder,
what
if
there
were
an
independent
elected
and
a
vacancy
occurred?
unknown
speaker
then
you
must
have
a
general
election.
unknown
speaker
what
didn't
work,
counsel?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
why
didn't
it
work?
what
was
their
judgment?
what
was
wrong
with
it?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
how
did
the
failure
of
this
elective
system
to
work
from
1952
to
1964
manifest
itself?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
element
in
the
unworkability
in
this
sense
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
election,
an
open
election,
it
may
be
that
the
other
party
would
win
the
election,
and
the
balance
in
the
existing
legislature
would
be
upset--
unknown
speaker
--or
did
they
just
prefer
to
have,
every
four
years,
they
wanted
to...
once
you
had
an
election,
you
were
going
to
maintain
that
particular
balance
or
proportion
for
the
full
four
years?
