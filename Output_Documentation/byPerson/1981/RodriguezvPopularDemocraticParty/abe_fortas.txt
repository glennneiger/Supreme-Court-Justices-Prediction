mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
confess
to
a
certain
degree
of
astonishment
in
this
case,
that
the
proposition
is
urged
that
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
right
or
a
federal
constitutional
obligation
imposed
upon
the
states
or
upon
puerto
rico
to
provide
for
the
election
of
state
or
puerto
rican
legislatures.
if
there
is
any
fundamental
proposition
involved
in
this
case
that
has
been
thoroughly
refuted
by
this
court
time
and
time
again,
beginning
with
minor
against
happensett,
it
is
that
proposition.
on
pages
19
and
20
of
our
brief,
we
refer
to
some
of
the
cases
and
some
of
the
statements
of
this
court
to
the
contrary.
for
example,
in
addition
to
minor
against
happensett,
for
example,
in
the
san
antonio
independent
school
district
case,
this
court,
through
justice
powell,
said
that
the
right
to
vote
per
se
is
not
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
justice
marshal,
in
his
dissent,
stated
it
this
way:
"the
right
to
vote
in
state
elections
has
itself
never
been
accorded
the
stature
of
an
independent
constitutional
guarantee.
"
the
law
is
as
stated
by
justice
rehnquist
earlier
this
morning.
that
is
to
say
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
impose
upon
the
states,
and
therefore
upon
puerto
rico,
the
requirement
of
providing
for
elected
legislatures,
although
the
federal
constitution
does,
as
this
court
has
constantly
reiterated,
the
federal
constitution
imposes
a
good
many
obligations
upon
the
state
as
to
how
that
franchise
must
be
administered
and
governed
once
the
state
has
decided
that
the
particular
officials
will
be
elected.
that
is
the
law,
and
you
are
today
invited
by
my
able
friend
to
reverse
that
provision
of
constitutional
law
which
is
so
deeply
embedded
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
would
support
such
an
assertion.
the
federal
constitution
is
based
upon
the
principle
that
the
states
will
provide
their
own
form
of
government,
that
the
states
will
provide
how
their
government
shall
be
organized
and
how
it
shall
be
conducted,
subject,
however,
subject,
however,
to
very
strict
and
rigorous
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
embodied
particularly
and
most
practically
in
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
to
how
the
elections
will
be
administered
and
how
the
election
rights
will
be
allocated.
that
is
the
basic
framework
of
our
government.
it
is
the
basic
concept
of
our
government.
there
has
never
been,
in
minor
against
happensett
or
any
other
case,
any
challenge
to
that
principle
as
the
basic
governing
principle
of
our
constitution.
now,
let
me
say,
if
your
honors
please,
that
so
far
as
puerto
rico
is
concerned,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
observance
of
that
principle
is
of
even
greater
importance
than
it
is
in
the
states.
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
basic
fundamental
guarantees
of
the
constitution
apply
to
the
people
of
puerto
rico
as
they
do
to
the
people
of
the
states.
puerto
rico,
as
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
remark
in
different
contexts,
however,
does
have
a
special
and
unique
status
in
the
american
system.
puerto
rico
is
an
unincorporated
territory,
that
is
to
say,
and
has
always
been,
that
is
to
say,
there
is
no
decision
by
the
congress
or
the
people
of
puerto
rico
as
to
whether
it
will
ever
be
assimilated
into
the
state
framework
of
the
united
states.
there
are
those
who
contend
it
should
be
independent,
and
there
are
those,
as
represented
by
the
popular
democratic
party,
who
have
long
advocated
that
puerto
rico
should
be
what
its
spanish
name
in
spanish
indicates,
the
free
and
associated
state
of
puerto
rico,
the
relations
of
which
to
the
united
states
are
governed
by
a
compact
entered
into
between
the
congress
and
the
people
of
puerto
rico.
we
have
respectfully
suggested
to
the
court
that
in
considering
the
present
problem,
it
is
appropriate,
it
is
necessary,
it
would
be
most
constructive
for
the
future
constitutional
development
of
puerto
rico
and
for
the
international
problems
that
have
clustered
around
the
unique
status
of
puerto
rico
and
which
are
a
source
of
constant
debate
in
the
united
nations,
in
which
some
nations
have
attacked
the
bona
fides
of
the
united
states'
position
in
puerto
rico
and
the
united
states'
assertion
that
puerto
rico
has
autonomy,
that
puerto
rico
has
the
right
to
provide
for
its
own
government,
and
that
the
people
of
puerto
rico
have
chosen,
freely
chosen
to
associate
with
the
united
states,
so
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
highly
advantageous
and
highly
desirable,
highly
appropriate
to
recognize
that
puerto
rico
has
not
only
the
autonomy
to
provide
how
its
representatives
will
be
elected,
subject
to
the
basic
constitutional
guarantees,
not
only
to
provide
that
it
has...
not
only
does
it
have
the
same
jurisdiction
and
power
and
authority
as
the
states,
but
that
in
considering
problems
as
to
the
constitutionality
or
the
propriety
of
what
puerto
rico
does
in
providing
its
local
government,
that
there
should
be
a
deference
given,
deference
paid
to
its
unique
status,
to
its
cultural
background,
to
its
history,
to
its
differences.
now,
let
me
briefly
address
myself
to
that
in
the
context
of
the
problem
before
your
honors.
this
system
of
filling
vacancies
in
puerto
rico
goes
back
to
1906.
that
is
to
say,
the
system
that
when
a
vacancy
occurs
in
various
offices,
it
will
be
filled
by
appointment,
by
appointment
in
effect
by
the
political
party,
goes
back
to
1906,
when
puerto
rico
was
a
colony.
there
is
no
point
in
mincing
words
about
it.
it
was
a
colony.
it
had...
under
the
folacher
act,
which
was
adopted
in
1900,
two
years
after
the
united
states
obtained
puerto
rico
from
spain.
in
1906,
puerto
rico
provided
that
in
the
event
of
a
vacancy
in
the
office
of
a
mayor
or
a
municipal
council,
that
vacancy
would
be
filled
until
the
next
general
election
by
appointment
or
on
designation
by
the
political
parties.
now,
at
that
time
puerto
rico
did
not
elect
its
legislature.
the
legislative
authority
was
exercised
by
the
united
states
and
by
designees
of
the
united
states.
but
it
did
have
authority
over...
the
appointment
of
mayors
and
municipal
councils
was
governed
by
puerto
rican
law,
and
it
was
so
provided.
and
that
party
designation,
your
honors,
is
deeply
embedded
in
puerto
rican
history,
much
more
so
than
we
are
accustomed
to
in
the
states.
even
when
puerto
rico
was
a
colony
of
spain,
and
before
the
autonomy
act
enacted
by
spain,
which
was
in
1897
or
eight,
even
when
puerto
rico
was
a
colony
of
spain,
party
organization
existed
in
puerto
rico
and
it
was
very
powerful
indeed,
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
party
organization
then
was
focused
on
the
same
issues
that
dominate
party
organization
today,
namely,
whether
puerto
rico
should
be
assimilated
to
spain,
which
is
the
counterpart
of
the
statehood
party
now,
and
the
mpp
with
which
the
appellants
here
are
affiliated,
whether
puerto
rico
should
be
autonomous
within
the
spanish
framework
of
government,
which
is
now
sort
of
the
general
counterpart
of
the
position
taken
by
the
popular
democratic
party,
the
appellees
whom
i
represent,
or
third,
whether
there
should
be
separatism,
independence
from
spain,
those
divisions
have
continued
through
all
these
years,
and
through
the
permutations
and
combinations,
and
they
are
reflected
by
the
various
political
parties
in
puerto
rico.
and
from
spanish
times
to
the
present,
the
party
organization
has
been
a
part,
an
essential
part
of
puerto
rican
life.
for
example,
i
am
advised
that
there
has
never
been
elected
to
the
puerto
rican
legislature
an
independent,
a
candidate
who
ran
as
an
independent,
although
the
puerto
rican
law
contains
very
liberal
and
generous
provisions
permitting
that.
i
am
also
advised
that
on
all
issues
of
controversy
in
the
puerto
rican
legislature,
party
loyalty,
party
discipline
is
a
fact
of
life.
the
allegiance
to
these
three
competing
ideas
of
status
is
a
dominant
factor
in
puerto
rican
life.
mr.
abe
fortas
the
law
provides
specifically
for
that.
then
you
have
to
have
a
general...
a
special
election.
mr.
abe
fortas
there
is
no
alternative
to
it.
but
the
point
here
is
that
in
1906,
this
same
provision
for
special
election
of
mayors
and
municipal
councils
was
in
the
law.
it
has
persisted
in
the
law
today.
in
1917,
congress
adopted
the
first
organic
act
for
puerto
rico.
puerto
rico
was
then
a
colony.
the
jones
act.
the
jones
act
provided
for
special
elections
to
fill
vacancies
in
the
legislature.
puerto
rico
was
given
the
right
to
elect
a
legislature
then.
in
1938,
that
provision
in
the
jones
act
was
changed
by
the
congress,
and
it
is
very
interesting
to
note,
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
it
was
changed
on
recommendation
of
the
non-voting
delegate
in
the
congress,
which
is
all
that
puerto
rico
now
has.
he
said
that
between
1917
and
1938,
there
have
been
vacancies
in
the
puerto
rican
legislature,
but
those
vacancies
have
not
been
filled,
because
special
election
was
required.
and
he
therefore
recommended
that
the
vacancies
be
filled,
that
congress
provide
that
vacancies
in
the
puerto
rican
legislature
be
filled
by
appointment
on
recommendation
of
the
political
party
to
which
the
previous
incumbent
had
belonged,
and
it
was
so
done.
congress
changed
the
organic
act
of
puerto
rico
to
provide...
to
make
that
provision
which
in
essence
and
in
principle
is
the
same
provision
that
we
are
talking
about
here
today.
now,
the
next
event
in
this
history
is
1952.
in
1952,
the
people
of
puerto
rico
adopted
their
own
constitution.
that
was
pursuant
to
a
compact
in
public
law
600
that
was
entered
into
between
the
congress
and
the
people
of
puerto
rico.
as
the
court
knows,
puerto
rico
was
still
subject
to
the
territorial
clause
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
congress
had
in
theory
complete
power
to
dispose
of
puerto
rico,
make
rules
for
it,
and
in
public
law
600
there
was
this
compact
entered
into,
which
was
a
historic
document
that
had
great
influence
throughout
the
world.
it
provided
a
model
on
which
some
other
nations
revised
their
arrangements
with
their
erstwhile
territories.
and
it
is
that
constitution
that
various
members
of
this
court
have
had
occasion
to
write
about
in
opinions
of
this
court
in
different
contexts.
it
was
that
constitution
that
provided
that
puerto
rico
shall
have
control
in
effect
of
its
own
destiny,
its
own
government,
subject
to
two
things.
one
is
the
fundamental
protections
of
the
united
states
constitution,
more
or
less
as
stated
in
the
old
insular
cases,
and
two,
subject
to
the
specific
arrangements
with
the
federal
government,
such
as
free
trade
and
various
types
of
specific
provisions.
that
was
a
great
act.
it
was
an
act
that
affirmed
the
uniqueness,
as
this
court
has
stated
it,
of
the
system
of
puerto
rico,
and
it
allowed
them
to
organize
their
own
government,
which
they
did
in
their
constitution.
now,
it
is
very
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
puerto
rican
constitution
as
it
was
originally
drafted,
there
were
two
types
of
provisions
that
related
to
legislative
vacancies.
one
related
to
the
at-large
posts.
the
puerto
rican
legislature
is
and
has
been
composed
of
two
houses,
of
course.
the
senate
has
27
members.
eleven
of
them
are
at-large,
and
16
are
selected
in
senatorial
districts.
the
house
of
representatives
is
composed
of
51
members.
forty
are
from
the
districts;
eleven
are
at-large.
now,
with
respect
to
vacancies,
the
constitution
in
1952
provided
that
vacancies
in
the
at-large
seats
would
be
filled
in
the
historic
manner,
namely
on
recommendation
of
the
political
party
to
which
the
incumbent...
with
which
the
incumbent
had
been
affiliated.
with
respect
to
district
representatives
and
senators,
the
constitution
originally
provided
for
an
election
of
a
successor.
now,
that
represented...
if
your
honors
please,
i
hope
i
am
not
speaking
out
of
turn
here...
it
represented
the
profound
view
that
most
everybody
has,
most
everybody
steeped
in
the
american
tradition
has
of
the
remarkable
men
who
were
responsible
for
the
drafting
of
that
constitution.
everybody,
i
suppose,
instinctively
would
prefer
to
have
elections
than
appointments.
and
that
reflected
their
view.
but
it
didn't
last.
it
didn't
work
in
puerto
rico,
and
the
result
was
that
just
as
it
didn't
work
under
the
jones
act,
the
first
organic
act,
and
had
to
be
changed
in
1938
by
the
congress,
so
this
didn't
work
either
for
puerto
rico,
and
in
1964,
the
people
of
puerto
rico
adopted
an
amendment
to
their
constitution
which
provided
that
the
selection...
that
the
filling
of
vacancies
for
district
representatives,
which
is
the
specific
thing
involved
here,
would
be
governed
by
laws
enacted
by
the
puerto
rican
legislature.
mr.
abe
fortas
the
special
election.
mr.
abe
fortas
it
didn't
work
because
of
the
mechanism
of
the
election,
because
of
the
particular
quality
of
the
controversies
that
occur
in
puerto
rico,
and
i
will
have
to
take
a
minute
to
describe
that,
if
i
may,
justice
white.
in
puerto
rico,
from
the
beginning
of
elections,
elections
are
held
once
every
four
years.
once
every
four
years
there
is
an
election
for
all
offices,
local
and
legislative,
mayors,
councils,
and
the
legislature.
until
the
last...
until
1977,
i
think
it
was,
the
way
they
ran
the
election
was
this.
all
puerto
rican
voters
assembled
in
a
particular
place,
at
particular
polling
places,
at
on
before
the
appointed
hour.
the
doors
were
then
closed.
nobody
could
enter
the
polling
places
after
the
appointed
hour.
nobody
could
leave
until
all
the
voting
was
over.
it
was
a
wonderful
system
to
prevent
repetition.
then
it
turned
out
it
was
a
great
fiesta.
at
the
same
time,
at
the
same
time,
in
the
puerto
rican
elections,
this
question
of
status,
this
question
of
status
is
a
highly
emotional,
disruptive
thing.
i
don't
have
to
tell
the
court
about
what
happens,
what
has
been
happening
and
has
happened
with
respect
to
the
nationalist
movement
in
puerto
rico,
which
is
the
advocates
of
independence
through
violence,
and
passions
about
this
question
of
status
there
are
unimaginable
to
anyone
who
hasn't
been
down
there
and
seen
it,
and
those
appeared
in
the
election.
the
next
thing
is,
puerto
rico
is
a
poor
place.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
it
is
not
just
whether
the
government
can
afford
this.
it
is
a
question
of
campaigning.
they
have
television
down
there,
too,
and
it
costs
money.
puerto
rico
is
a
poor
place.
puerto
rico
is
a
place
that
has
its
very
special
kind
of
folk
ways,
and
the
special
election
system
just
didn't
work,
and
as
you
read
the
puerto
rican
election
laws
now,
there
is
practically
nothing
that
relates
to
a
special
election.
it
just
does
not
fit.
and
the
question
here,
if
your
honors
please,
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
this
court
will
say
to
the
people
of
puerto
rico
that
because
of
something
that
i
can't
find
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
you
must
do
it
our
way.
mr.
abe
fortas
it
manifested
itself
in
the
fact
that
there
were
some
positions
that
were
just
allowed
to
remain
vacant,
and
were
not
filled,
particularly
the
district
representatives.
well,
the
at-large
people...
i
should
have
made
clear,
if
i
didn't,
that
the
provision
for
filling
at-large
vacancies
remained
the
same
throughout.
that
is
to
say,
in
the
1952
constitution
the
at-large
seats,
when
they
became
vacant,
were
filled
by
appointment
on
the
designation
of
the
political
party,
just
as
they
are
today.
and
the
failure
to
work
was
manifested,
as
i
said,
by
the
fact
that
some
vacancies
were
not
filled,
and
next
by
the
fact
that
when
special
elections
were
held,
they
were
not
satisfactory.
they
were
not
orderly.
you
had
the
passions
of
the
election
that
occurred
on
more
than
a
four-year
basis.
now,
we
may
like
that
or
not
like
it,
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
the
people
of
puerto
rico
would
prefer
to
have
the
passions
every
four
years
instead
of
once
in
a
while,
instead
of
occasionally.
mr.
abe
fortas
no,
the--
mr.
abe
fortas
--i
think
there
was
more
of
the
latter,
but
you
have
here
a
situation
where
people
are
accustomed
to
an
election
fiesta
every
four
years,
and
i
may
say,
justice
white,
that
there
are...
that
the
results
in
puerto
rico
are
fantastic.
there
is
about
90
percent
registration
of
eligible
voters;
about
80
percent
of
the
eligible
voters
vote,
more
than
80
percent
of
them.
it
is
a
record
that
is
unequalled
anywhere
else.
and
it's
a
record
that
they
prefer,
and
i
see
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
impacts
upon
this.
may
i
hurriedly
get
to
this
question
of
appointment
or
designation
by
political
parties?
there
are
in
the...
in
the
states
there
are
22
states...
21
states
of
the
union
plus
the
district
of
columbia
that
fill
vacancies
in
legislative
office
by
appointment
in
their
legislatures,
21,
almost
half
of
the
states,
and
of
those,
16...
16
of
the
states
fill
those
vacancies
by
appointment
upon
designation
by
a
political
party
or
they
have
to
be
filled
by
a
member
of
the
same
political
party,
16
of
them.
this
is
not
a
peculiar
puerto
rican
situation.
it
is
prevalent
throughout
the
states.
my
friend
would
ask
this
court
to
outlaw,
to
require
special
elections,
to
outlaw
election
in
the
event
of
any
vacancy.
i
don't
know
how
that
can
be
confined
to
district
representatives
in
puerto
rico,
and
not
to
at-large
representatives.
i
don't
know
how
on
a
principle
basis
that
principle
can
be
applied
to
avoid
its
application
to
appointment
of
someone
to
fill
a
vacancy
pending
a
special
election.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
devise
any
principle
that,
as
my
friend
asked
you
to,
that
would
permit
appointment
to
fill
a
short-term
vacancy
before
the
special
election.
puerto
rico,
if
the
vacancy
occurs
within
15
months
prior
to
a
special
election,
it
has
always
been
provided
that
the
vacancy
is
filled
by
appointments,
and
frankly,
i
don't
know,
as
we
have
elaborated
in
our
brief,
how
you
can
confine
the
principle
for
which
my
friend
contests
to
legislative
offices.
as
this
court
has
said,
an
elected
office,
when
the
state
decides
that
an
office
is
to
be
elected,
then
federal
consequences
apply,
whether
it
is
a
legislative
office
or
any
other
office
that
has
general
governmental
powers.
i
exclude,
as
this
court
has
done,
of
course,
boards
and
what-not
that
have
very
restricted
powers.
so
that
the
principle
that
my
friend
advocates
here
would
apply
in
all
of
these
situations
in
a
totally
impractical
way.
it
would
apply
to
all
legislative
situations,
to
all
appointed
situations.
now,
i
want
to
hasten...
my
time
has
expired.
may
i
have
one
moment,
if
your
honor
please?
on
this
political
party,
the
question
of
whether
the
appointments
can
be
made
by
the
political
party,
political
parties,
as
this
court
has
reiterated
time
and
time
again,
are
part
of
the
warp
and
woof
and
the
essence
of
our
official
elective
system.
appointment
by
a
political
party
is
not
like
appointment
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
or
a
labor
union.
it
is
an
appointment
on
designation
of
the
political...
of
a
mechanism
that
is
highly
regulated
and
that
is
part
of
our
system.
as
to
the
reasons
for
puerto
rico's
adoption...
justifying
puerto
rico's
adoption
in
this
system,
i
regret
i
can
only
refer
your
honors
to
our
brief,
but
the
preservation,
the
preservation
of
the
independent
party
system
to
which
this
is
essential,
the
appointment
system
is
essential,
the
assurance
of
representation
of
independent
parties
in
puerto
rico
is
fundamental
not
only
to
puerto
rico
but
to
this
very
special
situation
that
has
resulted
because
of
the
independence
movement
in
puerto
rico.
i
regret
that
i
must
respectfully
refer
you
to
the
brief
for
that.
thank
you
very
much.
it
has
been
a
great
pleasure
and
an
honor
to
be
here.
