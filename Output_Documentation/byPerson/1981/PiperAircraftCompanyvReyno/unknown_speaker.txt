mr.
fitzsimons,
let
me
get
a
little
more
background.
this
suit
was
instituted
in
california,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
by
whose
motion?
unknown
speaker
is
your
client
a
pennsylvania
corporation?
unknown
speaker
is
hartzell
a
pennsylvania
corporation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
effect,
you
accomplished
one
transfer,
and
then
sought
a
second.
unknown
speaker
would
you
also
say
that
in
scotland
there
would
be
no
trial
by
jury?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you...
where
is
the
critical
passage
where
you
claim
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
change
of
law
would...
is
the
crux
of
their
decision?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
it
started
right
out
and
reviewed
all
of
the
factors
that
the
district
court
had
considered
in
dismissing,
and
differed
with
the
district
court
on
every
single
factor,
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
think
that
if
they
hadn't
thought
what
they
did
about
the
change
of
the
law,
that
they
would
have
approved
the
dismissal?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
think
they
would
have?
i
thought
they
disagreed
with
the
district
court
on
every
single
factor.
unknown
speaker
and
found
that
none
of
them
would
warrant
the
dismissal.
unknown
speaker
i
had
the
same
problem
justice
white
did,
frankly.
i
thought
they
were
saying
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
thinking
the
jury
would
be
confused
by
the
foreign
law
and
the
differences
in
law,
things
of
that
nature.
rather
than
relying
entirely
on
this
point.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
where
do
they
say
that?
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
held
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
on
this.
it
says,
"even
under
the
district
court's
choice
of
law
analysis.
"
then
it
went
on
to
say
what
you
said.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
district
court
was
quite
wrong
in
its
choice
of
law
analysis.
i
understand
that
that's
what
the
circuit
court
says,
but
they
nevertheless--
--well,
they
went
ahead
and
nevertheless
said
what
you
say,
but
what
if
they
were
right
that
it's
the
american
law
that
governs
here?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so,
but
that's
a
different
point,
that's
a
different
point.
where
does
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
if
there
was
a
transfer
or
if
there
was
dismissal,
that
the
scottish
law
would
apply
if
the
case
were
tried
in
scotland,
even
though
under
their
analysis
the
law
of
pennsylvania
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
how
about
the
court
of
appeals--
unknown
speaker
--let's
assume
that
the
scottish
courts
would
apply
the
american
law,
like
the
court
of
appeals
held
should
be
applicable.
unknown
speaker
yes.
then
there
should
be
a
transfer,
there
should
be
a
dismissal,
shouldn't
there?
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
it
was.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gardner,
this
may
be
as
appropriate
a
place
as
any
for
me
to
ask
you
questions
on
my
mind
in
its
language
from
gulf
oil
corporation
v.
gilbert
on
page
508
where
the
court
says,
"factors
of
public
interest
also
have
a
place
in
applying
the
doctrine.
"
"administrative
difficulties
follow
for
courts
where
litigation
is
piled
up
in
congested
centers
instead
of
being
handled
at
its
origin.
"
"jury
duty
is
a
burden
that
ought
not
be
imposed
upon
the
people
of
a
community
which
has
no
relation
to
the
litigation.
"
isn't
foreign
non-convenience
not
just
a
doctrine
to
be
fought
out
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants,
but
doesn't
the
federal
judicial
administration
have
a
stake
in
it?
unknown
speaker
adverse
to
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
was
that
entirely
clear?
are
there
processes--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
just
wondering
in
this
body
of
law,
are
there
cases
in
which
a
manufacturer
has
been
sued
for
product
defect
in
his
home
office
where
the
product
is
manufactured,
where
he
has
ever
gotten
dismissal
on
the
foreign
non-convenience
ground?
unknown
speaker
there
are
not
very
many,
are
there?
unknown
speaker
i
could
imagine
this
motion
being
made
by
the
defendants
that
could
have
been
brought
in
scotland,
on
the
ground
that
there
are
witnesses
and
relevant
records
and
so
forth
at
the
home
office.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
age
of
the
case
is
partly
because
it
was
originally
filed
in
california
and
transferred.
unknown
speaker
is
that
all
a
defense
if
the
product
was
defective?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gardner,
i
take
it
that
one
of
the
questions
here
is
not
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
its
choice
of
law
conclusions.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
you
didn't
expressly
raise
the
question.
unknown
speaker
if
we
wish
to.
i
don't
know
that
we
particularly
wish
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask...
if
it
isn't
here,
if
we
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
if
the
case
were
tried
in
america
that
the
state
law,
the
american
law
would
apply.
if
we
judge
it
on
that
basis,
then
what
evidence
is
there,
or...
i'll
put
it
this
way.
are
you
in
agreement,
or
all
the
parties
in
agreement
that
if
the
case
shifted
to
scotland
that
the
american
law
would
not
apply?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
belief,
but
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
so?
unknown
speaker
and
are
the--
unknown
speaker
--no,
i
can
ask
the
other
side
and
i
certainly
shall.
unknown
speaker
but
your
view
is
that
the
courts
there
would
not...
would
apply
scottish
law
rather
than
american.
unknown
speaker
and
where
do
they
say
that?
unknown
speaker
i
think
everybody
agrees
with
that,
but
the
question
is
whether
they
would
apply
the
scottish
law.
unknown
speaker
not
like
any
other
court
because
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
doesn't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
all
except
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
find
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
referred
to
very
categorically,
mr.
gardner.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
to
read
three
pages
first
before
i
find
the
sentences.
unknown
speaker
you
may.
one
particular
sentence,
if
you'll
take
page
137
and
help
us
focus
on
that.
i
read
it
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
they're
reciting
the
arguments
rather
than
stating
their
view.
at
least,
so
it
seems
to
me,
although
somewhat
ambiguous.
unknown
speaker
you
take
it
as
a
conclusion
of
the
court
beginning,
"and
therefore,
scotland
probably
would
apply
its
own
law
to
all
claims.
"
you
suggest
we
read
that
as
their
holding.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
don't
have
the
same
difficulties
that
your
friends
have
with
understanding
this
opinion.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure.
0
[generallaughter.]
fine.
but
let's
address
the
clarity
of
it,
and
tell
us
where
they
hold
what
you
say
they
hold.
unknown
speaker
where
will
we
find
it?
is
that
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
and
where
will
we
find
the
carefully-written
opinion
of
the
third
circuit?
unknown
speaker
you
claim
it
begins
at
page
118
of
the
appendix?
that's
where
the
opinion
begins?
unknown
speaker
i
wish
i
knew
where
you
are
reading.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
at
page
a-120,
i
guess
in
the
consolidated
joint
appendix.
page
a-120,
the
last
paragraph
before
you
get
to
roman
numeral
i.
"the
trial
judge
abuses
discretion
in
dismissing
the
action.
"
that's
just
reciting
what
the
claim
is.
that's
just
a
contention.
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
subsidiary
sentence
is
not
part
of
the
contention.
it's
hard
to
tell.
unknown
speaker
starting,
"in
this
court,
reyno
raises
two
major
contentions?
"
unknown
speaker
that
merely
describes
the
contention;
it
doesn't
describe
the
holding.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
page
131
it
says,
"the
standard
of
review
is
one
of
abuse
of
discretion,
but
if
the
trial
court
has
not
held
the
defendants
to
their
proper
burden
or
has
clearly
erred
in
weighing
the
factors,
the
equivalent
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
has
been
demonstrated.
"
"discretion
must
be
exercised
within
the
applicable
standards.
"
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
the
applicable
factors
and
disagrees
with
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
what
law
do
you
say
applies
to
the
claims
of
the
negligence
of
the
pilot?
unknown
speaker
how
old
was
this
aircraft?
unknown
speaker
six
years
old.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
how
many
air
hours
were
logged
in
this
aircraft?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
i
raise
that
because
whether
this
is
or
would
turn
out
to
be
a
product
liability
case
or
a
negligence
case
in
terms
of
the
pilot
error,
is
not
very
clear
now,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
connection
of
reyno
with
the
passengers
on
board
the
airplane?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
run
up
there,
when
you
get
into
the
federal
court,
that
there
are
public
factors
involved,
too,
where
perhaps
the
federal
courts
could
be
better
utilized
for
matters
of
more
directly
federal
concern
than
a
secretary
in
a
law
office
acting
as
the
executor
for
parties
in
a
private
damage
action.
unknown
speaker
but
they're
all
in
scotland,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
they
could
sue
in
scotland.
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
want
to...
you
wanted
to
establish
a
principle
that
anybody
injured
in
any
nation
on
the
face
of
this
earth,
injured
by
a
product
made
in
the
united
states,
can
sue
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
our
justice
isn't
that
broad
now,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
you
trying?
you're
going
to
carry
it
at
least
to
the
united
kingdom.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
apply
to
a
toy
cart
in
russia
if
it
was
made
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
the
third
circuit,
in
justice
marshall's
example,
the
third
circuit
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
it
did
with
respect
to
the
applicable
law?
it
may
not
with
respect
to
the
transfer
factors,
but
with
respect
to
the
applicable
law,
it
would
hold
that
the
american
law
applies
in
justice
marshall's
example,
the
toy
in
russia
made
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
might?
would,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
here
we
have
a
case
in
which
it
is
not
yet
clear
whether
it's
pilot
error
or
negligence
of
the
pilot,
or
whether
it's
a
product
liability
case.
i
take
it
you'd
concede
that.
unknown
speaker
in
the
russian
cart
case,
there
is
no
such
complication.
unknown
speaker
but
let
me...
under
the
common
law
foreign
non-convenience
rule,
the
change
of
law
didn't
prevent
a
dismissal,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
here
thought
it
was
a
rather
substantial
factor.
unknown
speaker
and
so
do
you.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
you
haven't
seen
any
old
cases
like
that.
i
thought
that
the...
did
you
find
any
old
common
law
cases
on
foreign
non-convenience
that
makes
the
change
of
law
a
substantial
factor?
unknown
speaker
no.
and
you
do
have
cases
where
there
would
be
a
change
of
law
if
it
was
tried
in
another
forum
and
the
case
was
nevertheless
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
ask
that.
unknown
speaker
there
are
hardly
any,
i
suppose,
under
the
federal
rules.
it
would
just
be
international
cases.
unknown
speaker
let
me
come
back
to
an
earlier
point
that
was
discussed
somewhat.
what's
to
prevent
the
scottish
court
if
the
case
goes
there
from
applying
american
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
suggest
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
isn't
the
possibility
of
the
scottish
court
applying
american
law
precisely
what
justice
brandeis
said
in
canada
malting?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
to
take
that
risk.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't...
they
were
comparing
california
with
pennsylvania,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
issue
at
that
time
as
to
whether
the
case
should
be
tried
in
scotland.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
you
from
refiling
your
case
in
the
pennsylvania
state
court?
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
to
know
what
pennsylvania
law
is
on
dead
people
filing
lawsuits.
unknown
speaker
you
are?
unknown
speaker
i
was
trying
to
save
you
from
answering
the
question.
0
[generallaughter.]
go
right
ahead
and
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
your
answer?
could
you
file?
unknown
speaker
the
question
was
whether
they
could
file
in
pennsylvania.
i
think
you
started
to
say
if
you
did,
they'd
transfer
it
to
the
federal
court
which
would
then
dismiss
it.
unknown
speaker
are
you
so
sure
that
the
state
action
in
pennsylvania
would
automatically
be
removable?
one
of
your
defendants
has
principal
place
of
business
in
pennsylvania,
i
was
told.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
diversity?
oh,
you're
a
california
plaintiff,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
there
may
still
be
no
diversity
in
view
of
the
principal
place
of
business.
one
last
question.
do
i
understand
an
action
is
pending
in
the
courts
of
scotland?
unknown
speaker
you
said
not
against
the
manufacturer.
against
whom,
then?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
do
you
interpret
our
limited
grant
as
indicating
that
this
court
has
already
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
have
turned
exclusively
on
the
possibility
that
the
law
might
change
if
the
case
were
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
limited
the
grant
to
this
single
question,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
part
of
your
argument,
i
take
it,
is
that
even
if
the
law
weren't
going
to
change,
that
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
found
no
basis
for
the
transfer.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
third
circuit
seems
to
have
said
unequivocally
that
if
there
is
a
difference,
dismissal
would
not
be
justified.
they
say
that
at
page
140.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
apparently
the
rule
that
they
apply
in
the
third
circuit,
so
that
if
we
do
not
agree
with
that
rule,
don't
we
have
a
duty
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
say,
take
a
look
at
the
case
without
the
benefit
of
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
statement
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
you
defend
that
rationale.
unknown
speaker
you
really
haven't.
you
have
pretty
much
argued,
well,
they
really
didn't
mean
what
they
said.
