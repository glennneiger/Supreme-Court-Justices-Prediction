mr.
warner
w.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
if
i
may
continue
where
my
brother
fitzsimons
half
left
off
in
terms
of
the
decision
below,
i
believe
it
should
be
pointed
out
first
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
was
very
loosely
structured.
it
is
difficult
to
follow.
but
if
one
reads
what
it
said
and
reads
as
it
decided,
it
is
comparatively
clear.
it
went
first
to
the
so-called
private
factors
discussed
by
the
district
court.
as
to
three
of
them,
it
found
the
district
court
in
error
in
relying
upon
them
for
grounds
for
transfer.
it
did
not
say
that
they
were
grounds
for
retaining
the
case
in
pennsylvania.
they
had
a
weight
of
zero.
one
of
them,
the
inability
of
the
defendants
to
implead
those
in
scotland,
whom
we
believe
were
responsible
for
the
accident,
the
court
said
the
district
court
erred
in
assigning
it
great
weight.
it
was
entitled
to
weight,
the
court
said,
but
not
so
much.
we're
left
then,
on
the
private
factors,
with
all
being
given
the
weight
of
zero
and
one
being
given
a
lesser
weight
but
still
weight
toward
dismissal.
we
turn
to
the
public
factors
enumerated
in
the
gilbert
case.
the
court
undertook
to
examine
them
all.
it
got,
if
i
may
say
so,
bewitched
by
the
intricacies
of
the
choice
of
law
problem,
and
ended
up
with
the
belief
that
the
pennsylvania
law
could
be
applied
by
the
pennsylvania
court--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--it
obviously
has,
sir.
the
common
formulation,
the
shorthand
formulation,
for
the
many
factors
enumerated
by
justice
jackson
is
the
convenience
to
parties
and
the
interests
of
justice.
all
those
factors,
which
you
have
just
enumerated,
your
honor,
are
a
part
of
the
complex
collection
of
factors
that
should
be
balanced.
all
were
forgotten
by
the
third
circuit.
it
reached
the
conclusion
that
there
would
be
an
adverse
change
in
law
if
the
case
were
filed
in
scotland,
and
categorically
said
at
pages
139
and
140
that
that
was
sufficient
to
prevent
grant
of
the
motion.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
adverse
to
the
plaintiff.
at
page
156
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
its
concluding
paragraph,
it
said,
as
the
policy
interests
of
pennsylvania
and
ohio,
which
it
relied
to
determine
that
pennsylvania
law
would
be
applied,
point
to
trial
here,
all
other
factors
will
point
similarly.
in
short,
it
considered
none
but
the
choice
of
law
problem.
the
only
place
in
the
whole
38
pages
below
where
the
decision
is
explained,
is
the
one
paragraph
on
139
and
140.
after
the
review
of
private
factors,
just
drifted
off,
no
conclusion
was
drawn.
as
i've
said,
the
only
conclusion
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
private
factors
was
a
weak,
in
the
view
of
the
court
below,
factor
pointing
toward
dismissal.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
nothing
in
this
opinion
is
entirely
clear,
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes,
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
there
haven't
been
all
that
many
product
liability
cases.
the--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--the
difference
between
a
suit
in
scotland
and
a
suit
in
pennsylvania
is
that
in
scotland
both
parties
can
try
their
case.
the
defendant
will,
and
has
no
objection
to
having
the
dismissal
so
conditioned,
transport
to
scotland
all
of
its
witnesses,
all
of
its
records
if
they
wish
to
try
out
product
liability
on
an
aircraft
seven
years
old.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
hartzell
was
not
sued
in
california,
were
not
served
properly.
the
defendants
cannot
try
out
negligence
of
the
air
taxi,
of
the
pilot,
of
the
owner
and
maintenance
in
the
united
kingdom
and
in
scotland.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
we
can
assume
so,
i
believe,
that
if
the
product
were
defective,
it
surely
was
joined,
or
such
is
our
position,
by
negligence
on
the
part
of
those
who
were
maintaining
and
operating
the
aircraft.
we
cannot
assume
and
say
therefore,
the
defendants
cannot
try
their
case,
that
there
was
no
negligence.
and
we
cannot
try
our
case
without
the
compulsory
process.
none
of
the
scottish
witnesses
would
willingly
testify.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
it
adheres
in
the
question--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--it's
discussed
in
our
brief.
in
the
event
the
court
wished
to
examine
the
premise.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
in
that
case,
it's
not
here.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
that
is
my
belief,
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
the
court
of
appeals
so
stated.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
you're
asking
me
to--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--yes,
i
qualified
my
answer.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
we
agree...
that's
one
of
the
few
points
in
those
38
pages
that
we
agree
with.
the--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--at
page
137,
139
and
147.
the
discussion
is
not
connected;
these
are
isolated
sentences.
but
you
will
find
between
those
three
references
the
statement
that
the
scottish
courts
would
apply
lex
loci
delicto
to
choose
the
law
and
that
udder
scottish
law
there
would
he
no
strict
liability,
but
rather
negligence.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
i
go
back,
then,
to
the
earlier
statement
that
the
court
said,
i
believe
correctly,
that
the
scottish
courts
apply
the
doctrine
lex
loci
delicto,
would
apply
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
accident,
and
if
they're
like
any
court,
if
they
were
captured
to
apply
another
law,
they
would
look
at
the
place
of
residence
of
the
plaintiffs
and
find
that,
too,
to
be
scotland.
there
is
no
possible
doubt--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--i
will
amend
my
statement,
sir,
to
say--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--like
most
courts
is
perhaps
the
kindest
way
to
phrase
it.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
it's
not
categorical,
sir,
but
if
you've
read
those
three
sentences--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--i
wonder
if
i
may
help.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
start
at
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph
on
the
bottom
which
states
that
under
the
applicable
choice
of
law
rules,
the
american
or
scottish
law
would
apply.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
if
you
look
at
page
139,
i
must
have
thrown
in
137
as
the
introductory
part
of
it.
page
139,
the
beginning
of
the
last
paragraph
is
reasonably
categorical,
relating
the
affidavit
of
scottish
counsel,
to
the
effect
that
the
scottish--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--i
think
so.
when
you
come
to
page
147,
which
is
my
third
reference,
you'll
find
that
the
court
assumes
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
between
american
strict
liability
and
the
scottish
negligence
law
if
it
had
not
been
for
its
application
of
the
so-called
governmental
interests.
i
have
not
been
able
to
remove
my
feet
from
the
quagmire
of
the
decision
below,
and
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
the
court
permits,
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
the
rebuttal.
i
refer
the
court,
please,
to
our
briefs
for
our
position
on
the
law.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes,
sir.
i
have
two
minutes
and
56
seconds
in
which
i
hope
to
make
six
categorical
propositions
which
i
hope
further
will
add
some
enlightenment
to
this
narrow
question.
one,
i
was
not
able
to
answer
the
question
of
justice
stevens
as
to
product
liability
cases.
at
page
9
of
our
reply
brief,
we
list
seven
or
eight
product
liability
cases
dismissed
for
forum
non-convenience.
two
others
cited
in
our
briefs...
i
will
not
give
the
citations
here...
are
the
michell
and
the
harrison
cases.
the
case
of
canada
malting
was
mentioned
here.
we
are
of
the
view
there
is
no
way
the
court
below
can
be
affirmed
without
overruling
canada
malting,
which
very
clearly
dismissed
a
case
despite
seriously
adverse
changes
in
the
law.
i
don't
wish
to
resume
my
quarrel
with
the
court
below,
but
in
38
pages
they
never
mentioned
canada
malting.
mr.
cathcart
explained
correctly
that
the
suit
in
scotland
does
not...
was
not
brought
against
the
manufacturers.
his
statement
should
he
supplemented
by
the
fact
that
in
the
united
kingdom
there
is
a
suit
brought
by
the
pyrex
estate
against
the
american
manufacturers
over
whom
jurisdiction
has
been
asserted.
the
estoppel
point,
which
has
figured
here
and
there
because
of
statements
made
in
the
district
court
of
california,
decided
adversely
to
the
respondent
by
two
courts
below.
there
was
no
petition
for
certiorari
based
upon
that
nor
any
statement
in
the
brief
in
opposition
relying
upon
it.
we
think
it
is
a
little
late
to
bring
it
up
at
this
point.
what
to
me
was
a
critical
sentence
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
lay
just
one
sentence
beyond
the
extracts
which
justice
white
read
from
page
131.
the
last
sentence
of
the
paragraph
on
that
page
is,
"the
district
court's
wide
discretion
may
not
serve
the
defendants
as
a
burden-shifting
device
on
appeal
from
an
order
in
their
favor."
in
short,
discretion
of
the
district
court
is
given
great
weight
if
it
be
exercised
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
not
otherwise.
the
last
and
brief
sentence
is
that
the
statements
that
the
court
below
considered
all
factors
under
gilbert
is
flatly
wrong.
if
you
read
the
public
factors
enumerated
by
the
district
court,
you
will
find
them
ignored
by
the
court
of
appeals,
except
for
the
one
factor
which
is
categorically
described
on
page
139.
