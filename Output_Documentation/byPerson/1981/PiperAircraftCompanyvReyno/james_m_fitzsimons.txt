mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
thank
you.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
order
which
permits
us
to
come
before
this
court
today
restricts
the
appeal
to
the
sole
question
of
whether
a
federal
court
action
brought
by
a
non-resident
foreign
plaintiff
against
an
american
defendant,
whether
in
that
type
of
action
the
plaintiff
may
defeat
a
motion
to
dismiss
brought
on
the
ground
of
foreign
non-convenience
merely
by
showing
that
the
substantive
law
that
would
be
applied
if
the
case
were
litigated
in
that
plaintiff's
own
court
would
be
different
or
less
favorable
than
it
would
be
if
it
were
tried
here
in
america.
the
factual
background
of
this
case
is
quite
significant.
in
1976
there
was
a
small
six-seat
aircraft
that
crashed
into
the
mountains
of
scotland.
it
was
on
a
charter
flight
from
england
to
scotland,
and
the
crash
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
all
six
people
on
board;
five
passengers
and
the
pilot.
all
of
these
people
were
scottish
citizens.
the
aircraft
had
been
owned,
operated
and
maintained
for
several
years
prior
to
the
accident
by
scottish
interests,
and
the
pilot
was
employed
by
a
scottish
company.
the
aircraft
was
registered
with
the
british
authorities,
and
the
pilot
was
licensed
by
the
scottish
authorities,
and
the
accident
was
investigated
by
the
british
department
of
trade.
the
department's
proposed
report
was
the
subject
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
which
was
conducted
by
a
review
board
headed
by
mr.
and
later
lord
jauncey,
who
was
assisted,
again,
by
two
technical
advisors
from
scotland.
substantial
documentary
evidence
went
before
this
hearing,
and
some
13
witnesses
testified,
most
of
whom
were
technicians
from
great
britian.
the
hearing
took
place
in
edinburgh,
scotland,
and
as
i
say,
it
lasted
for
nine
days.
in
addition,
lord
jauncey
spent
a
day
in
farnsborough,
england,
inspecting
the
wreckage
of
the
aircraft.
presently,
what
remains
of
the
wreckage
is
still
at
farnsborough.
as
a
result
of
the
accident,
a
california
resident,
gaynell
reyno,
has
brought
this
action
to
recover
for
the
heirs
and
next
of
kin
of
the
decedents,
that
is,
the
passenger
decedents,
and
her
complaint
alleges
negligence
and
also
strict
liability.
although
she
sues
as
the
personal
representatives
of
the
estates
of
these
passengers,
she
is
in
no
way
related
to
them.
at
the
time
of
bringing
this
action,
all
of
the
heirs
and
survivors
of
the
deceased
passengers
were
scottish.
gaynell
reyno
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
california,
and
a
secretary
in
the
office
of
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiffs.
the
only
connection
which
the
united
states
has
with
this
accident
at
all
was
the
fact
that
some
seven
years
or
so
prior
to
the
time
that
the
accident
occurred,
the
aircraft
had
been
manufactured
in
the
united
states
by
piper
aircraft
company,
and
at
the
time
of
its
manufacture,
it
was
equipped
with
a
propeller
that
was
manufactured
by
hartzell
in
ohio.
almost
immediately
after
its
manufacture,
the
aircraft
was
sold
to
an
interest
in
ohio,
and
by
some
chain
of
events
not
known
to
defendants,
found
its
way
over
to
scotland.
on
the
motion
of
the
defendants,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
granted
an
order
dismissing
this
action
on
the
ground
of
foreign
non-convenience,
and
it
conditioned
that
dismissal,
as
courts
generally
do,
on
the
defendants
waiving
any
statute
of
limitations
defense
they
might
have
and
agreeing
to
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
scotland.
it
might
be
well
to
point
out
here
at
this
particular
time
that
these
same
plaintiffs
have
brought
actions
in
scotland
against
the
operating
company,
against
the
owner
of
the
aircraft,
two
scottish
interests,
against
the
pilot,
pilot's
estate,
a
scottish
interest,
and
indeed,
against
the
british
civil
aviation
authority.
and
the
pilot's
estate
himself
has
also
started
an
action
over
in
great
britain.
in
the
memorandum
opinion
which
accompanied
the
order,
the
district
court
considered
the
factors
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
seminal
foreign
non-convenience
case
of
gulf
oil
against
gilbert
and
its
progeny.
and
it
concluded
that
the
defendants
had
shown
overwhelming
reasons
for
a
foreign
non-convenience
dismissal.
and
that
court
also
said
that
it
would
be
no
less
than
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
its
part
if
it
did
not
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
foreign
non-convenience,
as
the
gilbert
criteria,
quote,
"overwhelmingly
point
to
dismissal".
the
district
court
weighed
all
the
private
interest
factors
set
forth
in
gilbert,
and
found
that
they
all
clearly
pointed
to
trial
in
scotland.
the
district
court
also
weighed
the
public
interest
factors
laid
down
in
gilbert,
and
similarly
concluded
that
all
of
these,
too,
favored
the
trial
in
scotland.
and
in
considering
these
public
interests,
the
district
court
said
that
uppermost
in
its
mind
was
the
fact
that
a
trial
could
be
complex
and
confusing
to
a
jury
because
it
would
have
to
apply
the
rule
of
law
of
scotland
to
hartzell
and
the
rules
of
liability
law
of
pennsylvania
to
piper.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
was
instituted
in
california
and
sent
to
pennsylvania
on
a
1404
transfer.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
by
the
motion
of
the
defendant,
defendant
piper.
hartzell,
at
that
time,
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
it
was
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
they
are
a
delaware
corporation,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
they
are.
but
the
principal
place
of
business
of
piper
is
in
pennsylvania,
and
that's
where
this
aircraft
was
manufactured.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
that
was
required
because
the
court
over
in
california
had
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon
the
situation
with
respect
to
hartzell
where
jurisdiction
did
not
lie.
and
the
district
court
found
that
this
did
not
constitute
any
reason
why
it
should
not
be
heard.
in
any
event,
the
circuit
court
also
found
that
the
product
liability
law
of
scotland
would
not
apply
to
hartzell,
but
that
indeed,
the
law
of
pennsylvania
would
apply
to
both.
and
what
the
court
said
was
this:
the
court
held
that
if
the
case
were
transferred
over
to
scotland,
that
the
scottish
law
would
apply,
and
the
plaintiffs
would
lose
their
cause
of
action
for
strict
liability
and
that
this
was
impermissible.
the
third
circuit
cited
demateos
against
texaco,
inc.
as
authority,
and
it
held
that
a
dismissal
for
foreign
non-convenience,
like
a
statutory
transfer
under
1404(a),
should
not,
despite
its
convenience,
result
in
a
change
in
the
applicable
law.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
i'm
not
certain
that
there
would
not
be
a
trial
by
jury
in
scotland,
your
honor.
i
know
that
there
would
not
be
in
england,
but
i'm
not
certain
about
that
subject
in
scotland.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
oh,
they
did
not
say
in
so
many
words
that
it
is
the
crux
of
their
decision,
but
they
started
right
up
front,
your
honor,
by
discussing
the
question
of
law
and
what
they
said,
in
effect,
was,
that
was
the
only
public
factor
that
they
considered,
and
then
at
the
end
of
their
opinion
they
said,
we
don't
have
to
consider
any
others.
and
i
refer
the
court
to
a
139.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
not
the
way
i
read
the
decision.
the
way
i
read
the--
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
--i
believe
that
they
should
have,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
mr.
justice
white,
the
way
i
read
that
decision
is
that
they
considered
three
private
factors;
convenience
of
witnesses,
compulsory
processes
interpleader
and
view
of
the
premises.
and
then
one
public--
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
--that's
right.
and
then
one
public...
well,
that's
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
would
be
the
change
of
the
law,
your
honor.
that's
inherent
in
the
decision.
and
on
the
public
side,
they
just
took
the
applicable
law
only,
just
that
one.
so
they
did
not
go
through
every
one
that
the
district
court
had
gone
through.
in
any
event,
your
honor,
the
decision--
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
--the
circuit
court
clearly
held
that
the
law
which
would
be
applied
to
both
defendants
would
be
the
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
and
the
court
did
say
in
so
many
terms,
so
many
words
rather,
that
you
cannot
have
a
dismissal
where
that
would
work
a
change
in
the
law.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
they
say
that,
your
honor,
and
i
will
show
it
to
you,
at...
it's
starting
on
139
of
the
appendix.
"even
under
the
district
court's
choice
of
law
analysis
requiring
a
mixture
of
american
and
scottish
law,
it
is
apparent
that
the
dismissal
would
work
a
change
in
the
applicable
law
so
that
the
plaintiff's
strict
liability
claim
would
be
eliminated
from
the
case.
"
"but
this
court
has
held
that
a
dismissal
for
foreign
non-convenience,
like
a
statutory
transfer,
should
not,
despite
its
convenience,
result
in
a
change
of
the
applicable
law.
"
"only
when
the
american
law
is
not
applicable
or
when
that
foreign
jurisdiction
would,
as
a
matter
of
its
choice
of
law,
give
the
plaintiff
the
benefit
of
the
claim
to
which
she
is
entitled
here--
"
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
--your
honor,
even
if
that
were
true,
the
inequities
that
would
be
involved
that
the
district
court
did
not
treat
with
or
treated
with
improperly,
certainly
should
have
called
for
a
dismissal.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
your
honor,
i
cannot
point
to
that
exactly
but
i
know
that
that
was
a
finding
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
where
the
district
court
said--
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
--i
don't
think
the
circuit
court...
let
me
see.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
if
scotland
would
do
that?
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
if
they
were
going
to
apply
that
law.
in
any
event
there
should
be,
your
honor,
because
the
basic
fairness
of
this
rule
the
way
it
is
right
now
is
briefly
as
follows.
it
requires
the
scottish
plaintiff
to
come
over
here
to
america
to
prosecute
the
case.
it
handicaps
the
defendant
in
that
the
defendant
cannot
add
the
parties
that
it
needs
to,
the
parties
that
the
district
court
found
to
be
necessary
parties
to
be
impleaded,
such
as
the
owner,
the
operator
and
the
estate
of
the
pilot.
should
the
defendant,
so
handicapped,
lose,
it
now...
an
american
defendant
has
to
go
all
the
way
over
to
scotland.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
to
press
his
action,
and
that
is
just
basically
unfair,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
fitzsimons
not
in
light
of
the
fact
that
their
basis,
that
the
pennsylvania
law...
that
there
could
not
be
a
change
in
the
law,
and
i
say
that's
the
hingepin
of
their
decision.
