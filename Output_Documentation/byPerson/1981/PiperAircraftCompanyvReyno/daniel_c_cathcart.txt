mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--no,
sir,
i
find
it
to
be
a
very,
very
fine
and
well-written
and
well-reasoned
opinion.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
say
they
hold
that
when
applying
the
factors
of
gulf
oil
versus
gilbert,
which
have
been
applied
since
1947
in
cases
of
this
nature,
they
have
no
trouble
finding
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
judge,
and
this
carefully-written
opinion
examines
each
one
of
those
factors
and
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
case
turns
on
an
abuse
of
discretion;
it
does
not
turn
on
the
question
of
foreign
law.
if
we
look
at
page
4
of
the
decision,...
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
it
referenced
as
to
the
index
which
accompanied
our
briefs.
but
the
court
language
on
page
4
makes
it
very
clear--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--it's
in
the
appellate
decision,
and
i
can
quickly
find
it
because
it's
very
early.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
in
the
joint
appendix,
yes.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
that's
a
matter
of
qualitative
judgment
which
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
thorough
analysis.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
it's
just
a
little
bit
farther
into
the
opinion,
if
i
can
find
the
exact
language
wherein
the
court
indicated
that
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
dismissing
the
action.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
in
quotes,
"subsidiary
but
arguably
crucial
to
this
second
point
is
the
claim--
"
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--all
right,
let
me
see
if
i
can
quickly
find
that
for
you
in
the
appendix.
0--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
that
is
correct.
there
is,
i
believe,
on
the
fourth
page,...
and
if
i
could
just
count
it...
a
copy
of
the
decision.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
it
is
on
page
a-120
of
the
decision
in
the
second
complete
paragraph.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
yes,
sir,
that
is
where
i
find
it.
and
those
are--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
but
the
holding
of
the
court,
as
we
go
through
the
decision,
was
based
upon
a
careful
examination
of
every
one
of
the
gulf
oil
v.
gilbert
factors
and
a
weighing
of
these
in
concluding
that
we
have
in
this
case
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
judge.
and
based
upon
that,
the
case
turned.
now,
the
court
went
on
to
indicate
that
where
american
law
applies,
a
forum
non-convenience
dismissal
should
not
be
granted.
and
in
that
instance,
in
looking
through
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioners
here,--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--that
is
correct
in
every
instance.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
the
law
as
to
the
negligence
of
the
pilot
may
very
well
be
governed
by
scottish
law,
but
the
negligence
of
the
pilot
in
a
products
liability
action
is
not
a
defense.
and
therefore,
we
may
not
need
to
have
the
trier
of
the
fact
judge
by
any
standard
his
negligence.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
has
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
law,
the
domestic
american
law
of
products
liability,
of
establishing
fault,
either
under
restor
or
sui
statement
of
tort
2nd
402
2nd,
or
under
a
variation
thereof.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
the
aircraft
was
several
years
old.
i
can't
tell
the
court
exactly
how
old
it
is,
but
i
believe
five
or
six
years
old.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
but
the
distinction
i'd
like
to
draw
for
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
this
is
a
design
defect
case.
the
plaintiffs
are
alleging
that
the
design
of
the
aircraft
was
a
proximate
cause
of
the
accident,
and
that
that
design
was
defective.
so
we're
going
beyond
attacking
one
item;
that
is,
that
there
was
a
defect
in
the
manufacture.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
of
this
moment
because
we
have
been
dealing
with
procedural
matters
and
not
with
discovery
matters.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
it's
clear
what
our
burden
must
be
in
order
to
prevail
against
the
manufacturer,
since
we
represent
the
estates
of
passengers
on
board
the
airplane.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
gaynell
reyno
is
the
nominal
party
plaintiff
who
was
appointed
by
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court
as
personal
representative
of
the
estate.
she,
at
the
time,
was
a
secretary
within
my
law
firm
and
she
is
not
a
real
party
in
interest.
she
was
appointed
because
under
california
procedural
law,
an
action
for
wrongful
death
can
be
brought
in
the
names
of
the
heirs;
it
also
can
be
brought
on
behalf
of
the
heirs
by
the
personal
representative
of
an
estate.
since
we
do
have
choice
of
law
issues
here
as
to
what
wrongful
death
statute
does
apply,
or
at
least
had
to
at
the
time
that
this
case
began,
we
had
to
choose
or
elect
in
which
form
to
bring
the
action.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
she
certainly
is
only
a
nominal
plaintiff,
and
therefore,
her
interest
is
only
that
of
occupying
a
title
in
discharging
a
court-appointed
responsibility.
but
the
real
parties
in
interest
are
people
who
have
lost
their
breadwinners,
and
it's
a
matter
which
should
be
of
great
concern
to
a
federal
court,
and
this
case--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--they're
all
in
scotland.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
they
could
sue
in
scotland.
they
may
or
may
not
get
jurisdiction,
but
the
defendants,
as
they
typically
do
in
cases
of
this
nature,
have
agreed
to
waive
statutes
of
limitations
and
to
make
themselves
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
court
because
of
the
obvious
advantages
which
inure
to
them
under
different
law,
different
standards
and
lack
of
a
trial
by
jury.
and
there's
no
question,
one
of
the
attractive
features
besides
the
location
of
a
substantial
quantum
of
proof
as
to
a
design
defect
being
right
at
the
manufacturer's
place
of
business
is
the
fact
that,
i
still
believe
and
i
think
my
clients
belief,
our
system
of
justice
is
without
equal
in
our
system
of
determining
what
is
just
and
adequate
compensation
for
real
losses.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i'm
not
asking...
no,
sir,
i
am
not
asking--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--i
don't
think
it
should
be
that
broad
and
that's
what
i
am
not
seeking
here.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
no,
sir,
i'm
not
trying
to
do
that,
justice
marshall.
i'm
trying,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
to
demonstrate
the
right
of
people
who
indeed
are
aliens
to
sue
a
u.s.
manufacturer,
in
this
case,
two
u.s.
manufacturers,
for
claimed
defects
in
their
products
which,
by
happenstance,
because
of
an
airplane
being
what
it
is,
an
object
which
can
and
can
be
anticipated
to
go
to
many
jurisdictions--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--it
might,
if
we
went
through
all
the
gulf
oil
v.
gilbert
factors
and
concluded
that
this
was
an
appropriate
place
to
sue,
and
that
the
defendant,
under
the
facts
situation,
did
not
meet
its
burden.
i'm
certainly
not
trying
to
ask
this
court,
as
i
believe
the
petitioners
are,
to
come
up
with
new
law,
a
new
doctrine,
that
aliens
should
not
be
allowed
to
bring
actions
for
products
liability
in
this
country.
and
i
think
that's
the
way...
even
though
the
issue
was
quite
limited
under
which
certiorari
was
granted,
the
briefs
have
been
expanded
to
encourage
this
court
to
make
such
a
finding.
i
don't
believe
we
should
close
the
doors--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--yes,
the
third
circuit
might
very
well
find--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--well,
if
we
read
demateos
and
the
reyno
decision,
i
think
the
probabilities
are
that
they
would.
but
if
we
look
at
demateos,
we
see
a
case
which
had
no
american
connection
whatsoever
that
was
of
significance.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
concede
that
defendants
have
a
contention
and
to
that
extent
that
they've
urged
it,
it
is
not
clear.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
perhaps
there
is
not
such
a
complication,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
important
is
that
the
question
of...
from
the
cases
that
i've
examined
and
been
able
to
find
is
the
question
of
foreign
law
has
never
been
the
determining
factor.
it
certainly
wasn't
in
demateos.
demateos
they
found
had
no
connection
to
the
united
states
other
than
by
happenstance.
it
happened
it
just
barely
crossed
the
line
into
our
territorial
waters.
but
if
we
go
through
the
various
decisions,
ones
in
the
dover
straits,
most
of
them
are
from
admiralty,
we
don't
have
a
clearcut
case
where
american
law
has
been
the
determining
factor.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
don't
think
it
did
and
i
don't
know
that
it
should.
i
think
it's
a
factor,
it's
a
gulf
oil
v.
gilbert
factor
that
the
court
should
consider.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
they
did,
indeed.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
do
believe
it's
a
significant
factor
from
a--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--i
don't
know
of
a
case
that
makes
it
a
determining
factor.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
do
not
know
of
any
recent
cases,
and
none--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--all
right.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
perhaps
that
is
correct,
and
i
know
of
none
and
i
can
cite
none
to
the
court.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
the
only
information
that
we
have
on
scottish
law
is
in
the
affidavits
of
counsel
that
are
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
they
strongly
suggest
that
the
scottish
courts
would
apply
the
law
of
scotland.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
yes.
and
the...
but
we
cannot,
from
this
record,
determine--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--i
don't
want
to
take
that
risk
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
when
it
was
not
raised
that
strongly
in
the
lower
court.
we
have
another
factor
in
this
case,
because
as
i
understand
the
limited
issue,
we're
talking
about
whether
it
can
be
denied
merely
because
foreign
law
will
apply.
and
i
submit,
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents,
that
it
is
merely
an
element
that
must
be
considered
and
should
be
considered.
but
we
go
to
another
factor
which
i
think
is
a
very
important
factor
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
moved
this
case
already,
and
moved
this
case
upon
the
representation
to
the
courts
involved
by
way
of
affidavits
that
pennsylvania
is
overwhelmingly
fair
to
all
parties.
in
addition,
by
way
of
affidavit,
piper
has
said
in
the
affidavit
of
november
22,
1977,
judicial
temporal
and
geographical
interests
are
best
served
by
a
transfer
to
pennsylvania,
though
propriety
of
transferring
the
within
action
to
pennsylvania
for
the
convenience
of
witnesses
overwhelms
other
factors.
now,
that
defendant
should
be
estopped
from
now
coming
into
court
and
saying
now
that
we
have
moved
you
to
our
own
backyard,--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--they
were
comparing
the--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--that
is
correct,
they
did
not
raise
it
at
this
time.
but
they
pointed
out,
using
gulf
oil
v.
gilbert
criteria,
why
it
should
be
transferred
to
pennsylvania
and
transferred
to
the
place
of
manufacture.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
perhaps
could
refile
it
but
i
suspect
i'd
be
removed
on
diversity.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
know
i'm
reasonably
familiar
with
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
reasonably
certain.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i,
under
the
pressure
of
the
moment,
did
not
appreciate
that
or
seem
able
to
take
advantage
of
that.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
the
answer
to
the
question
is
basically,
i'm
not
clear
what
the
question
is.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
the
federal
court,
unless
guided
by
the
third
circuit
opinion,
which
hopefully
will
remain
the
law
of
this
case,
would
have
to
leave
the
case,
i
assume,
intact
here
on
the
basis
that
certainly,
it's
an
important
element
here
under
gulf
oil,
that
the
very
wrong
of
which
the
plaintiffs
complain,
the
defective
design
of
the
airplane,
took
place
in
pennsylvania
right
at
the
place
where
this
trial
is
going
to
be
held.
and
presumably,
the
manufacturer
and
all
of
his
employees
and
people
who
were
instrumental
are
located
there,
as
is
a
substantial
amount
of
proof
concerning
the
manufacturing
process,
the
role
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
in
that
process,
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
yes,
piper
does
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in...
we
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
pennsylvania,
and
also
in
the
state
of
florida.
and
although
i
believe
them
to
be
nominally
a
delaware
corporation,--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--yes,
sir.
for
scottish
people.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
yes,
there
is
an
action
pending
not
against
the
manufacturers,
but
there
is
an
action
pending
in
the
courts
of
scotland,
which
was
filed
after
the
procedural
issues
arose
as
to
whether
these
people
would
be
allowed
to
go
forward
or
would
not
be
allowed
to
go
forward
in
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
it
would
be
against
the
operator
of
the
aircraft,
the
owner
and
perhaps
against
the
deceased
pilot's
estate.
on
that
i
do
not
know
for
sure.
what
we
have
here,
or
what
is
solicited
by
the
defendants
in
this
case
as
manufacturers,
and
urged
by
major
airplane
manufacturers
in
their
amicus
curiae
briefs
is
an
effort
to
cause
this
court
to
adopt
a
policy
to
close
the
door
in
products
liability
cases
on
accident
which
involve
products
defectively
made
in
the
united
states
but
which
are
sold
abroad,
and
which
the
manufacturer
can
be
expected
to
be
involved
in
accidents
in
anyplace
of
the
globe
because
of
the
ubiquitous
nature
of
aircraft,
and
large
aircraft
in
particular.
and
the
law
of
the
united
states
has
not
gone
that
far.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
law
of
the
united
states
so
far
has,
where
there
is
a
u.s.
connection
and
a
reason
particularly
to
apply
american
law,
the
courts
of
the
united
states
have
been
open
to
the
victims
of
aviation
accidents
around
the
world.
and
in
a
design
case,
it's
particularly
important
that
they
be
open
because
design
involves
not
just
one
defective
article,
but
involves
perhaps
a
fleet
of
articles;
articles
operating
in
this
country
and
elsewhere
in
which
the
united
states
has
a
significant
interest.
we
have,
then,
the
manufacturers
trying
to
use
a
procedural
rule
to
bring
about
a
substantive
result,
a
procedural
rule
which
would
under
given
circumstances
deny
causes
of
action
and
deny
in
some
circumstances
the
right
of
recovery
against
u.
s.
manufacturers
for
defectively
made
products
here.
that,
in
my
opinion,
is
a
policy
which
should
not
be
encouraged
and
should
not
be
sanctioned
by
the
highest
court
of
this
land.
the
dismissal
process
should
not
be
used
as
a
protective
shield
to
determine
the
outcome
of
litigation,
but
to
the
contrary,
it
should
be
used
only
when
there
is
no
real
nexus
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
no
conceivable
basis
upon
which
the
manufacturer
could
play
a
role
in...
the
u.
s.
base
manufacturer
could
play
a
role
in
the
manufacturing
process.
i
think
our
position
is
that
based
on
the
limited
issue
to
which
certiorari
has
been
granted,
that
no
matter
how
this
court
decides
that
issue,
it
should
not
be
determinative
or
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
third
circuit
court
opinion,
because
of
the
very
detailed
and
elaborate
weighing
of
all
of
the
gulf
oil
versus
gilbert
factors,
and
as
urged
in
our
brief,
because
the
decision
clearly,
from
the
depth
of
that
decision
and
the
detail
in
the
decision
in
examining
those
factors,
the
decision
turns
not
on
foreign
law
or
whether
it
does
or
does
not
apply,
although
it
was
a
significant
factor
by
the
court.
it
is
clear
that
all
of
the
other
gulf
oil
versus
gilbert
factors
also
were
found
by
the
appellate
court
to
cause
this
court,
the
appellate
court
to
believe
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
judge
and
a
failure
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof
which
the
forum
non-convenience
cases
impose
upon
a
moving
party,
and
there
was
no
evidence
presented
which
shows
that
suing
a
manufacturer
in
his
own
back
yard,
where
the
alleged
wrongful
conduct
was
conducted,
is
somehow
vexing
or
harassing
a--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--i
don't
read
it
on
that
alone.
i
read
it--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--yes,
it
was
limited
to
a
single
question
when
many
others
were
raised,
and
that
is
why,
although
the
petitioners
have
sought
a
review
of
this
court
ab
initio,
whether
the
third
circuit
acted
properly
or
did
not
act
properly
on
all
issues,
the
granting
of
the
writ,
which
is
limited
to
the
issue
of
must
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
grounds
of
forum
non-convenience
be
denied
whenever
the
law
of
the
alternate
forum
is
less
favorable
to
recovery
than
that
which
would
be
applied
by
the
district
court,
if
we
answered
that
question
yes
or
no,
because
of
the
word
"whenever"
or
as
used
by
counsel
in
argument
and
in
their
briefs,
merely
by
showing,
we
are
not
expanding
this
to
be
a
broad
issue--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--that
is
correct.
even
if
foreign
law
were
to
be
applied,
and
because
we
are
applying
in
1404(a)
transfers,
foreign
law
frequently,
when
we
take
the
conflict
of
laws
principles
involved,
and
it
may
require
the
use
of
foreign
law,
i.e.,
the
law
of
a
foreign
state,
in
deciding
a
case,
and
according
to
van
dusen
versus
barrack,
the
law
of
the
transferor
state
accompanies
the
transfer
of
the
file,
including
its
conflict
of
laws,
and
accordingly
a
transferee
court
can
apply
a
foreign
law,
albeit
a
foreign
state,
but
there
is
no
distinction
of
any
great
significance
to
whether
or
not
it
is
foreign
state
or
foreign
country.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
it
certainly
did,
and
it
adopted
its
own
language
out
of
demateos,
but
if
we--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--i
don't
believe
so,
because
i
don't
think
the
decision
in
that
lower
court
turned
on
that
one
statement.
it
turned
on
a
myriad
of
factors,
and
that
one
statement,
although
important
and
of
significance,
was
not
determinative.
it
was
not
determinative
in
de
mateos,
because
in
de
mateos
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
nexus
to
american
law
whatsoever,
and
therefore
the
court
did
not
have
to
answer
that
question.
it
said,
this
case
does
not
belong
in
the
united
states
under
the
factual
context.
it
is
all
foreign.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
think
that
it
is
a
correct
statement
to
say--
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
--i
defend
that
rationale.
mr.
daniel
c.
cathcart
i
don't
believe
that
it
needs
to
extend
that
far
to
justify
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit.
the
opinion
can
stand
even
if
this
court
should
disagree
with
that
statement.
i
do
not
find
that
statement
in
any
opinions
other
than
those
by
the
third
circuit
and
by
some
of
the
text
writers
on
the
subject,
who
have
suggested
strongly
that
the...
as
in
the
fifth
circuit,
in
the
fisher
versus
ajios
nicolaos
v,
628
f
2nd,
308,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that
says
where
u.
s.
law
is
applicable,
jurisdiction
is
retained,
and
i
think
that
is
one
side
of
the
coin,
but
what
do
we
do
if
u.
s.
law
is
not
applicable,
and
that
is
something
that
is
not
before
us
at
this
time.
