justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens
must
be
denied
when
dismissal
would
result
in
the
change
in
applicable
law
unfavorable
to
the
plaintiff.
the
action
arises
out
of
a
crash
of
a
small
airplane
in
the
scottish
highlands.
the
pilot
and
all
five
passengers
were
killed
instantly.
the
decedents
as
well
as
their
heirs
and
next
of
kin
were
all
scottish.
the
respondent
is
an
american
who
is
acting
as
representative
of
the
victims
in
states.
she
filed
a
damage
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
against
petitioners,
the
american
corporation
that
manufactured
the
aircraft
and
its
propellers.
she
concedes
that
she
filed
a
suit
in
the
united
states
solely
because
american
law
was
more
favorable
than
scottish
law.
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens
claiming
that
the
trial
should
take
place
in
scotland.
the
district
court
granted
their
motion.
it
found
that
the
private
interest
relating
to
the
convenience
of
the
litigants
and
the
public
interest
relating
to
the
convenience
of
the
court
itself
favored
trial
in
scotland.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
that
court
noted
that
the
dismissal
and
trial
of
the
cases
in
scotland
would
lead
to
a
change
in
applicable
law
that
would
be
unfavorable
to
the
respondents.
it
ruled
that
dismissal
should
be
automatically
barred
in
such
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
further
held
that
that
dismissal
was
inappropriate
because
the
district
court
had
not
properly
balanced
the
private
and
public
interests.
today,
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
possibility
of
an
unfavorable
change
in
law
could
not
automatically
bar
dismissal
on
the
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens.
automatic
dismissal
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
a
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
and
would
pose
substantial
practical
problems.
we
also
hold
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
determining
that
the
private
and
public
interest
favored
trial
in
scotland.
thus,
we
reverse.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
these
cases.
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
and
justice
stevens
joined
by
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
