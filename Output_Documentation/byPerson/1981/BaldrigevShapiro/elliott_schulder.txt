mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
these
two
cases
present
the
question
whether
congress
in
the
census
act
has
prohibited
the
disclosure
to
local
government
officials
of
address
lists
prepared
by
the
census
bureau
in
the
course
of
conducting
the
decennial
census.
baldrige
versus
shapiro
involves
a
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
for
the
bureau's
lists
of
all
street
addresses
of
residential
units
within
essex
county,
new
jersey.
mcnichols
versus
baldrige
concerns
a
civil
discovery
request
made
during
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
census
results
for
the
bureau's
lists
of
vacant
dwelling
units
in
denver,
colorado.
we
submit
that
the
different
factual
postures
of
the
two
cases
should
not
lead
to
different
results.
our
view
is
that
the
language,
structure,
history,
and
purpose
of
the
census
act
compel
the
conclusion
that
raw
census
data
in
the
hands
of
the
census
bureau
relating
to
particular
census
respondents,
including
the
address
data
at
issue
here,
may
not
be
disclosed.
my
argument
will
proceed
as
follows.
first,
i
will
give
a
brief
description
of
the
enumeration
procedures
employed
in
the
1980
census.
second,
i
will
outline
the
procedural
backgrounds
of
the
two
cases.
third,
i
will
explain
why
the
census
bureau's
address
lists
come
within
the
confidentiality
mandate
of
the
census
act.
finally,
i
will
show
that
the
confidentiality
mandate
applies
regardless
of
whether
the
information
is
sought
under
the
foia
or
under
civil
discovery
rules.
mr.
elliott
schulder
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
1980
census,
like
the
two
decennial
censuses
that
preceded
it,
was
conducted
primarily
through
the
use
of
the
mails.
the
census
bureau
mailed
out
questionnaires
for
response
on
or
about
the
census
date
of
april
1st,
1980.
beforehand,
the
bureau
had
compiled
master
address
registers
for
each
of
some
300,000
enumeration
districts
in
the
country.
in
urban
areas
an
enumeration
district
consists
of
fewer
than
325
street
addresses.
the
master
address
registers
are
bound
books
listing
separate
street
addresses
for
each
residential
unit,
and
it
includes
such
information
as
householders'
names,
the
number
of
units
at
that
address,
whether
the
unit
is
vacant
or
occupied,
and
the
number
of
persons
in
each
unit.
the
appendix
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
mdl
plaintiffs,
the
multi-district
litigation
plaintiffs,
contains
a
sample
copy
of
the
page
from...
of
a
page
from
the
address
register,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
that
appendix,
if
the
court
is
interested
in
seeing
what
one
of
these
things
actually
looks
like.
the
lists
of
addresses
included
in
the
registers
were
compiled
from
commercial
mailing
lists,
census
postal
checks,
pre-enumeration
canvassing
in
the
field
by
census
personnel,
and
from
direct
responses
to
census
questionnaires
and
to
interviews
conducted
by
census
employees
during
the
enumeration
process.
after
most
of
the
questionnaires
were
returned,
the
bureau
conducted
two
follow-up
procedures
to
check
the
status
of
addresses
from
which
responses
had
not
been
received,
and
to
check
units
that
originally
had
been
listed
as
vacant.
the
enumerators
were
instructed
not
to
classify
a
unit
as
vacant
without
verifying
that
fact
through
interviews
with
either
the
owner
or
a
neighbor.
in
addition
to
these
follow-up
procedures,
the
census
bureau
gave
local
government
officials
an
opportunity
to
review
and
comment
on
the
bureau's
population
and
housing
tabulations.
as
part
of
this
local
review
program,
the
bureau
provided
aggregate
information
for
each
enumeration
district,
including
the
number
of
housing
units,
the
number
of
vacant
units,
and
population
figures.
in
the
shapiro
case,
respondent,
the
executive
of
essex
county,
new
jersey,
filed
an
action
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
seeking
disclosure
of
the
census
bureau's
address
registers
for
all
of
the
enumeration
districts
in
the
county.
respondent
shapiro
contended
that
as
part
of
his
participation
in
the
bureau's
local
review
program,
he
needed
the
address
registers
in
order
to
compare
the
bureau's
address
lists
with
the
county's
lists,
and
thereby
to
determine
whether
the
bureau
had
counted
all
of
the
housing
units
within
essex
county.
the
bureau
claimed
that
the
census
act
bars
release
of
all
raw
census
information
relating
to
particular
census
respondents,
including
lists
containing
addresses
of
buildings
in
which
individuals
reside.
and
the
bureau
further
claimed
that
this
information
was
therefore
exempt
from
disclosure
under
exemption
3
of
the
foia.
the
district
court
in
an
oral
opinion
held
that
the
census
act
does
not
bar
disclosure
of
census
bureau
address
lists
to
local
government
officials
seeking
to
participate
in
the
local
review
program.
the
court
ordered
the
bureau
to
disclose
its
address
lists
to
respondent
shapiro
and
his
agents.
the
court
further
ordered
that
the
lists
were
to
be
edited
as
far
as
possible
to
delete
information
other
than
street
addresses.
finally,
the
court
directed
that
respondent's
agents
be
sworn
to
observe
the
confidentiality
requirements
of
the
census
act.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
without
opinion.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
mcnichols,
after
the
census
bureau
submitted
to
denver
officials
its
working
figures
for
each
enumeration
district
as
part
of
the
local
review
program,
denver
challenged
the
bureau's
vacancy
figures,
claiming
that
its
own
vacancy
estimates
were
much
lower.
denver
requested
the
bureau
to
produce
address
lists
of
all
vacant
housing
units
within
the
city,
so
that
the
city
could
determine
the
validity
of
the
bureau's
data.
the
bureau
refused
to
turn
over
the
requested
information,
contending
as
it
did
in
the
shapiro
case
that
its
address
lists
of
housing
units
are
subject
to
the
confidentiality
provisions
of
the
census
act.
petitioner
mcnichols,
the
mayor
of
denver,
then
filed
an
action
claiming
that
the
bureau
had
substantially
undercounted
denver's
population
in
reliance
on
its
allegedly
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
vacancy
figures.
denver
requested
discovery
of
the
bureau's
updated
address
registers.
the
bureau
again
responded
that
this
material
was
confidential.
the
district
court,
however,
ruled
that
denver
needed
the
address
registers
in
order
to
mount
a
meaningful
challenge
to
the
bureau's
vacancy
figures,
and
did
order
the
bureau
to
disclose
either
the
address
registers
themselves
or
an
address
list
of
vacant
units
derived
from
the
registers.
the
bureau
was
directed
to
delete
the
names
and
other
information
that
might
identify
census
respondents.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
district
court
did
stay
its
order
pending
appeal,
but
it
did
provide...
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
specific
time
frame.
i
don't
recollect.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
critical
date,
your
honor,
insofar
as
the
decennial
census
is
concerned,
is
april
1,
1980,
which
was
the
date
on
which
everyone
was
supposed
to
have
been
counted,
and
as
we
mentioned
in
our
opening
brief
in
shapiro,
or...
no,
i
believe
in--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
actual
request
by
the
petitioners
in
mcnichols
was
for
a
list
of
the
follow-up
address
registers
that
had
been
compiled
by
the
census
bureau.
those
registers,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
were
directed
as
ascertaining
the
status
of
individual
housing
units
as
of
april
1,
1980,
the
census
date.
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
discovery
order
in
mcnichols.
the
court
noted
that
public
cooperation
with
the
census
depends
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
government's
promise
to
keep
census
information
confidential,
and
it
held
that
both
the
language
and
history
of
the
census
act
established
that
congress
intended,
and
i
quote,
"both
a
rigid
immunity
from
publication
or
discovery
and
a
liberal
construction
of
that
immunity
that
would
assure
confidentiality.
"
our
argument,
in
a
nutshell,
is
that
the
language,
structure,
history,
and
purpose
of
the
census
act's
confidentiality
provisions
all
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
census
bureau
may
not
reveal
raw
census
data
relating
to
individual
census
respondents,
including
address
lists.
we
have
developed
these
points
at
length
in
our
briefs,
and
will
not
repeat
them
in
detail
here.
however,
i
would
like
to
highlight
some
key
themes.
first,
examination
of
the
language
and
structure
of
the
act
reveals
congress's
purpose
to
erect
a
wall
of
confidentiality
for
identifiable
individual
census
data.
section
8(b)
of
the
act
provides
that
the
bureau,
or
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
his
agents,
which
in
this
case
essentially
means
the
census
bureau,
may
disclose
numerical
tabulations
and
statistical
materials,
but
there
is
a
very
important
limitation
placed
upon
that
disclosure.
even
numerical
tabulations
and
statistical
materials
may
not
be
disclosed
if
that
disclosure
would
reveal
information
reported
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
particular
census
respondent.
this
limiting
language
serves
the
same
essential
purpose
as
the
confidentiality
provisions
that
are
contained
in
section
9(a)
of
the
census
act.
section
9(a)(1)
of
the
act
prohibits
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
his
agents
from
using
information
furnished
under
the
act
for
any
purpose
other
than
the
statistical
purposes
for
which
it
is
supplied.
the
local
governments
in
these
cases
have
asserted
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
address
lists
because
they
wish
to
use
those
lists
for
statistical
purposes.
but
the
census
act
provides
that
only
the
secretary
and
his
agents
may
use
information
furnished
under
the
act,
and
then
only
for
statistical
purposes.
there
is
no
provision
for
use
of
this
material
outside
the
census
bureau.
and
i
might
add
that
in
a
1937
report
by
the
director
of
the
census
bureau
to
the
secretary
of
commerce,
the
director
noted
that
it
was
then
the
practice
of
the
bureau
not
to...
not
to
employ
any
outside
individuals
for
the
purpose
of
tabulating
the
bureau's
statistical
information.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
will
turn
to
that
a
little
bit
later,
justice
marshal.
mr.
elliott
schulder
in
any
event,
even
if
disclosure
to
local
officials
challenging
the
census
may
be
deemed
a
statistical
purpose,
our
submission
is
that
disclosure
is
nevertheless
barred
under
other
provisions
of
the
census
act.
section
9(a)(2)
of
the
act
bars
any
publication
whereby
the
data
furnished
by
any
particular
census
respondent
can
be
identified.
the
local
governments
in
these
cases
have
argued
that
the
census
act
bars
only
disclosures
that
would
identify
individual
census
respondents,
and
that
they
seek
not
names
but
merely
addresses.
but
this
contention
ignores
the
language
of
section
9(a)(2)
which
prohibits
the
secretary
from
making
any
publication
that
could
identify
the
data
furnished
by
any
particular
establishment
or
individual.
mr.
elliott
schulder
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
the
point
of
all
of
these
provisions
in
section
9(a)
is
that
congress
wanted
to
make
it
clear
and
meant
to
leave
no
room
for
doubt
that
all
raw
census
data
within
the
hands
census
bureau
could
not
be
disclosed
to
outside
persons.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
we
submit
that
the
disclosure
of
this
information
would
come
under
the
term
"use".
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
and
one
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
whole
purpose
and
statutory
scheme.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
point
is
that
this
particular
provision
does
not
only
bar
disclosures
that
could
lead
to
identification
of
the
source
of
the
information.
it
bars--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
it
bars...
it
bars
any
disclosure
that
could
lead
to
identification
of
the
data
furnished
by
any
particular
establishment
or
individual.
it
doesn't
go
solely
to
identifying
names
of
census
respondents.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
precisely.
our
point
is
that
any--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
that
may
be
true.
these
particular
provisions
of
the
statute
were
developed
in
the
early
part
of
this
century.
some
of
them
were
added
at
different
stages
along
the
way,
but
the
point
of
the
statutes
and
the
legislative
history
bears
this
out,
is
that
each
time
that
an
additional
provision
was
added
to
the
census
act,
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
was
attempting
to
tighten
the
confidentiality
provisions.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
true,
but
that...
that's
true
in
part,
but--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
street
address
information
is
recorded
on
individual
responses.
mr.
elliott
schulder
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
local
governments
in
these
cases
have
asked--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
except
for
the
fact
that
each
of
the
addresses
that
are
listed
disclosed
the
fact
that
those
addresses
contain
residential
dwelling
units.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
true,
but--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
point
is
that
most
of
the
information
here,
most
of
the
street
addresses
were
actually
either
confirmed--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--you
can't...
no,
that's
true,
that
you
can't.
mr.
elliott
schulder
absolutely
not,
justice
rehnquist.
the
enumerators
were
specifically
instructed,
and
the
record
in
the
mcnichols
case
bears
this
out,
that
before
they
could
list
an
address
as
vacant,
they
had
to
confirm
that
information
either
with
a
neighbor
or
with
the
owner
of
the
property
in
question.
so
there
was
information
even
as
to
vacant
units
that
was
derived
from
responses
to
inquiries
conducted
by
census
employees.
section
9(a)(3)
of
the
statute
prohibits
anyone
other
than
sworn
officers
of
the
department
of
commerce
or
the
census
bureau
to
examine
individual
reports.
the
local
governments
contend
that
they
do
not
wish
to
examine
the
individual
census
reports,
which
they
agree
may
not
be
disclosed,
but
the
address
registers
are
a
compilation
of
address
data
that
appear
on
individual
reports.
in
many
cases,
addresses
are
added
to
the
registers
solely
as
a
result
of
the
reports,
and
the
reports,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
also
verify
address
information
obtained
by
the
bureau
from
other
sources.
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
congress
meant
on
the
one
hand
to
prohibit
examination
of
raw
information
in
individual
reports
and
on
the
other
to
permit
the
examination
of
the
same
information
after
it
is
transferred
to
a
different
piece
of
paper.
section
9(b)--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--it
may
not
be
possible
to,
as
you
indicated
earlier,
justice
stevens,
to
ascertain...
certainly
the
address
registers
don't
indicate
the
particular
source
of
the
information,
and
as
i
will
develop
a
little
bit
later,
the
whole
purpose
underlying
these
provisions
would
be
undercut
by
any
type
of
exceptions
to
the
confidentiality
provisions
that
the
local
governments
propose
in
these
cases.
section
9(b)
confirms
the
broad
scope
of
these
confidentiality
protections
that
are
contained
in
9(a)
of
the
census
act.
section
9(b)
refers
to
the
provisions
of
9(a),
and
i
quote,
"relating
to
the
confidential
treatment"
of
data
for
particular
individuals
and
establishments,
"and
the
whole
theme
of
erecting
a
wall
of
confidentiality
is
underscored
by
other
provisions
in
the
act.
"
for
example,
section
1
of
the
act,
the
definitional
section,
has
a
very
broad
definition
of
respondent
that
defines
a
respondent
as
any
individual,
organization,
or
entity
that
reports
information
or
on
behalf
of
whom
information
is
reported.
section
6
of
the
act
provides
that
to
the
extent
possible,
the
census
bureau
is
to
obtain
information
from
sources
other
than
individual
respondents.
the
purpose
of
that
provision
was
to
limit
the
burden
on
respondents
for
having
to
respond
to
census
inquiries.
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
meant
to
subject
the
information
obtained
from
other
sources
to
disclosure
merely
because
it
may
have
been
obtained
from
other
sources.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
respondent
burden
and
heightening
the
privacy
protections
of
the
act
to
say
that
information
obtained
from
other
sources
could
be
disclosed,
whereas
information
obtained
only
from
the
census
respondents
themselves
could
not
be
disclosed.
the
legislative
history
of
the
census
act,
of
the
foia,
and
of
the
privacy
act
also
support
our
reading
of
the
statute.
the
history
of
the
census
act
shows
that
over
the
years
congress
has
continuously
tightened
the
confidentiality
protections
of
the
act.
early
in
this
century,
in
1909,
congress
provided
the
first
explicit
provision
that
is
the
forerunner
of
section
9(a),
which
was
applicable
only
to
industrial
establishments
and
mining
establishments.
that
provision
prohibited
the
secretary
from
using
information
obtained
under
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
of
permitting
anyone
other
than
the
sworn
employees
to
examine
the
reports.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
don't
believe
it
did,
your
honor.
we
have
referred
to
it
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
shapiro
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
don't
believe
it
had
gotten
out
of
committee.
in
1919,
congress
enacted
additional
legislation
that
is
the
forerunner
of
section
8(c)
of
the
act.
that
legislation
provided
essentially
that
information
could
not
be
used
to
the
detriment
of
any
respondent
or
other
person
to
whom
the
information
related.
now,
that
might
lead
someone
to
argue
that
since
congress
inserted
a
specific
provision
forbidding
use
to
the
detriment
of
any
individual,
that
congress
thereby
recognized
that
certain
information
could
be
disclosed,
but
the
point
of
fact
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
in
1919
specifically
underscores
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
mean
by
this
provision
to
imply
that
there
was
any
kind
of
disclosure
permitted
under
the
act.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
was
just
about
to
address,
your
honor,
the
basic
purposes
of
these
provisions.
the
first
purpose,
of
course,
is
to
protect
the
privacy
of
census
respondents,
but
the
confidentiality
mandate
of
the
census
act
goes
beyond
ordinary
privacy
considerations.
much
of
the
census
information
that
is
being
sought
in
this
case
or
that
is
collected
by
the
census
bureau
is
not
inherently
private.
it
is
the
sort
of
information
that
an
individual
could
gather
by
walking
down
the
street
and
making
inquiries,
as
we
indicated
in
our
opening
brief
in
shapiro
at
pages
34
to
36.
the
point
is
here,
though,
that
the
major
purpose
of
these
confidentiality
provisions,
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
case
law
examining
the
statute
and
by
the
legislative
history,
is
that
the
confidentiality
mandate
of
the
act
is
meant
to
assure
the
public
that
the
information
they
submit
will
be
kept
secret,
and
by
doing
this,
congress
sought
to
encourage
public
cooperation
with
the
census.
without
that
public
cooperation,
the
ability
of
the
census
bureau
to
collect
information--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
you
know
that
the
census
bureau
has
ascertained--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
well,
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
not--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
other
sources
may
be
able
to
get
that
information,
but
my
point
is--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct,
but
the
point--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
problem
is
that
if
the
information...
if
this
sort
of
information
were
disclosed
by
the
census
bureau,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
census
act
allowed
the
disclosure
of
this
particular
information,
which
is
information
relating
to
particular
individuals,
and
information
that
is
confirmed
by
particular
individuals
in
the
course
of
the
census
process--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--but
the
information
is--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--in
some
cases,
that's
correct,
but
in
many
cases
the
information
is
corrected
or
updated
by
direct
responses
to
the
census
itself.
the
point
is
that
the
public
is
not
going
to...
the
public,
if
it
hears
of
a
decision
of
this
court
mandating
broad
disclosure
of
even
this
type
of
information,
the
public
is
not
going
to
be
sophisticated
enough
to
differentiate
between
one
form
of
disclosure
and
another,
and
congress
recognized
this
in
erecting
these
broad
confidentiality
provisions
of
the
census
act.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
am
not
certain
about
how
the
address--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--it
probably
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
would
think
that
that
would
probably
occur
in
at
least
a
number
of
cases,
sure.
mr.
elliott
schulder
or
whether
the
address
is
occupied
at
all.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
there
are
two
cases,
justice
marshal.
the
shapiro
case
from
new
jersey
involves
a
list
of
all
residential
addresses
within
essex
county,
new
jersey.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
district--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
district
court's
order
provides
or
directs
that
to
the
extent
possible
names
or
other
identifying
information
should
be
deleted.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
second
case,
the
one
from
denver,
the
mcnichols
case,
involves
a
disclosure
order
directed
at
vacant
housing
units
within
the
city
of
denver.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
that
would
be
true.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
have
made
the
point
that
there
would
be
a
burden--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--but
we
don't
defend
on
that
ground.
we
simply
point
it
out
to
the
court.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
and
i
think
at
this
point
it
is
worth
making
the
point
that
disclosure
of
this
information
could
conceivably
have
harmful
effects
to
individuals
who
have
cooperated
with
the
census
process.
mr.
elliott
schulder
of
course,
that
is
another
of
the
problems
involved
in
this...
in
this
and
other
cases
that
have
raised
questions
concerning
the
conduct
of
the
census,
but
i
do
want
to
make
the
point
that
disclosure
that
certain
buildings
are
used
as
residences,
may
be
used
to
the
detriment
of
individuals
who
are
occupying
buildings
that
are
zoned
for
commercial
use
only,
or
that
are
occupying
multi-unit
structures
that
are
in
an
area
that
is
zoned
only
for
single-unit
use,
and
similar--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--excuse
me?
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
information
provided
here
might
eventually
lead
to
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
the
occupants
of
the
premises
are
in
fact
illegal
aliens,
or
are
welfare
recipients
who
don't
necessary
quality
for
benefits,
and
numerous
other--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
giving
an
address
will
reveal
how
many
units
are
at
a
particular
location,
because
there
is
a
separate
address
listing
for
each
unit,
so
if
the
registers
provide,
for
example,
five
units
with
the
same
address,
that
will
reveal
to
local
officials
that
there
are
in
fact
five
dwelling
units
within
that
building,
and
in
an
area
which
might
be
zoned
for
two
or
only
one
unit,
it
would
reveal
a
violation
of
a
zoning
ordinance.
mr.
elliott
schulder
oh,
they
certainly
might
be
able
to
get
that
information
from
a
private
firm,
but--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--but
there
is
no
census
act
with
confidentiality
provisions
that
applies
to
private
firms.
the
census
act
applies
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
his
agents,
including
the
census
bureau.
this
court
in
st.
regis
recognized
the
fact
that
census
information
in
the
hands
of
the
census
bureau
is
immune
from
discovery.
it
is
because
of
the
statute
and
because
congress
recognized
the
need
for
confidentiality
that
we
are
in
this
court
today.
mr.
elliott
schulder
oh,
no
question
about
that,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
the
plaintiffs
were,
i
am
sure,
able
to
develop
their
own
address
lists
based
on
tax,
local
taxes
and
various
other
local
government
activities.
there
is
no
question
that
they
had
numerous
other
sources
for
the
same
information.
one
of
the
points
we
are
trying
to
make
here
is
that
each
of
these
local
governments
is
trying
to
carve
out
a
special
exception,
a
special
narrow
exception
to
the
census
act's
confidentiality
mandate.
for
example,
respondent
shapiro
argues
that
unlike
the
petitioners
in
mcnichols,
he
should
be
entitled
to
disclosure
of
address
lists,
because
those
lists
will
not
reveal
the
occupancy
status
of
a
building.
the
mcnichol
petitioners,
on
the
other
hand,
claim
that
disclosure
of
addresses
of
vacant
dwellings
is
permissible
because
that
information
supposedly
concerns
non-existent
persons.
these
approaches
demonstrate
the
unworkability
of
a
policy
providing
for
a
limited,
piecemeal
disclosure.
the
next
case
that
may
come
down
the
road
will
seek
yet
another
exception
to
the
confidentiality
provisions
of
the
act.
exceptions
of
this
sort
would
undermine
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
security
of
census
information
in
the
hands
of
the
census
bureau,
and
in
the
long
run
would
reduce
census
accuracy
by
deterring
numerous
persons
from
cooperating
in
the
census.
we
submit
that
our
construction
of
the
statute,
unlike
that
of
the
local
governments
in
these
cases,
is
both
workable
and
consistent
with
the
language
and
history
of
the
statute.
because
the
census
act
absolutely
bars
disclosure
of
the
information
at
issue
here,
there
can
be
no
exceptions
of
the
sort
urged
by
the
local
governments,
regardless
of
whether
the
information
is
sought
under
the
foia
or
under
civil
discovery
rules,
and
regardless
of
the
motives
of
the
particular
local
government
seeking
the
information.
under
the
foia,
if
a
particular
matter
is
exempt
from
disclosure,
the
foia
simply
does
not
apply,
and
the
needs
of
a
requester
are
irrelevant.
similarly,
under
the
civil
discovery
rules,
privileged
matter
is
not
discoverable.
in
the
census
act,
as
we
have
argued,
and
as
we
argue
more
fully
in
our
brief
in
the
mcnichols
case,
congress
established
an
absolute
privilege
barring
official
disclosure
of
raw
census
data
relating
to
individual
respondents.
thus,
congress
has
already
struck
the
balance,
and
there
is
no
occasion
to
balance
a
party's
need
for
this
information
against
the
public's
need
to
preserve
confidentiality
in
a
particular
case.
finally,
even
if
the
needs
of
the
particular
requesters
here
were
relevant,
they
are
not
sufficient
to
overcome
the
important
public
policy
against
disclosure.
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
in
its
local
review
program,
the
census
bureau
provided
local
governments
with
aggregate
statistical
information
on
housing,
vacancies,
and
population
for
each
enumeration
district,
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
enumeration
districts
constitute
very
small
geographical
units
within
urban
areas,
less
than
325
street
addresses.
now,
the
local
review
program
was
established
to
enable
local
officials
to
provide
information
to
the
bureau,
and
was
not
intended
to
provide
local
governments
with
an
opportunity
to
conduct
what
would
amount
to
an
internal
audit
of
the
bureau's
operations.
there
is
no
reason
why
essex
county
and
denver
could
not
have
participated
in
the
local
review
program
in
a
meaningful
way
without
access
to
confidential
census
information.
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
today
and
those
articulated
in
our
briefs,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
in
shapiro
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
mcnichols.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
several
brief
points.
counsel
for
essex
county
has
attempted
to
argue
that
if
our
interpretation
of
the
census
act
is
correct,
then
the
census
bureau
has
no
authority
to
disclose
even
the
statistical
information
that
it
normally
does
after
conducting
the
decennial
census.
well,
the
point
is
that
section
8(b)
of
the
act
specifically
provides
authority
for
disclosure
of
tabulations
and
statistical
materials,
so
long
as
those
disclosures
do
not
refer
to
information
reported
by
or
on
behalf
of
individual
respondents.
now,
the
test
that
we
have
proposed
for
interpreting
the
confidentiality
mandate
of
the
census
act
can
be
found
at...
summarized
at
page
17
of
our
brief
in
mcnichols.
and
basically
what
that
test
is,
under
the
act,
only
aggregate
statistical
information
may
be
disclosed,
and
even
then
the
information
may
not
be
disclosed
if
those
statistical
figures
may
disclose
information
reported
by
or
on
behalf
of
an
individual
respondent.
this
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
we
have
cited
in
a
footnote
on
page
30
of
our
brief
in
shapiro.
in
that
opinion,
the
attorney
general
addressed
an
inquiry
concerning
the
disclosure
of
names
and
addresses
of
certain
employees
in
an
upstate
new
york
city,
and
also
names
and
addresses
of
people
who
the
census
bureau
had
found
were
illiterate.
the
latter
group
of
names
and
addresses
were
sought
by
educational
and
other
public
service
institutions
that
were
attempting
to
conduct
a
literacy
campaign.
the
attorney
general's
opinion
indicated
that
the
census
bureau
felt
its
obligation
to
preserve
the
secrecy
of
this
sort
of
information
to
be
so
strict
that
it
would
not
disclose
even
statistical
information
in
certain
communities,
if
that
information
would
lead
an
individual
to
identify
the
particular
establishments
or
individuals
that
the
information
related
to.
next,
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
underscore
what
i
attempted
to
say
earlier,
that
even
a
bare
list
of
addresses
such
as
is
being
sought
by
essex
county
could
be
harmful
to
individual
respondents,
because
the
address
lists
that
are
maintained
by
the
bureau
refer
not
to
commercial
properties
but
to
residences,
so
that
if
a
commercial
property
contained
a
residence,
and
the
bureau
discovered
this
in
the
course
of
the
census,
that
address
would
be
listed
on
the
census
bureau's
address
lists.
now,
the
address
on
the
county's...
the
county
may
not
have
a
residential
listing
for
that
particular
address.
therefore,
the
disclosure
of
this
information
would
identify
particular
units
that
are
being
used
for
residential
purposes
that
the
county
or
local
government
may
not
know
about,
and
such
use
may
be
in
violation
of
local
housing
codes
or
zoning
ordinances.
mr.
elliott
schulder
if
that
information
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
census
bureau
in
the
course
of
the
conduct
of
the
local
review
program
that
i
described
earlier,
and
if
the
information
were
sufficiently
broken
down
into
enumeration
district
totals,
so
that
the
census
bureau
could
check
the
city's
figures
against
its
own
figures,
then
presumably
the
census
bureau
would
be
able
to
correct
its
figures
in
line
with
what
the
city
had
found.
mr.
elliott
schulder
suppose
that
the
bureau
did
not
correct
its
own
figures?
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
don't
necessarily
concede
that
there
is
any
room
for
judicial
review
of
the
census
process.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
narrow
issue
in
these
cases,
of
course,
is
one
of--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
we
agree
with
judge
merritt's
decision
in
the
sixth
circuit
case,
young
versus
klutznick.
mr.
elliott
schulder
excuse
me?
mr.
elliott
schulder
perhaps,
yes.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
that
that
is
probably
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
would
be
a
use
that
would
be
barred
by
the
statute
under
our
reading.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
the
constitution
specifically
provides
that
the
decennial
census
shall
be
conducted
in
a
manner
that
congress
shall
direct
and
congress
has
provided
in
the
census
act
for
the
conduct
of
the
census
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
his
delegates,
in
this
case
the
census
bureau.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
plaintiffs
in
essex
county
filed
a
freedom
of
information
act
lawsuit.
mr.
elliott
schulder
in
denver,
they
brought
a
preliminary
injunction
action--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i
don't
have
the
statute
in
mind--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
no,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
it
was
a
lawsuit
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
the
case
went
up
on
interlocutory
appeal
that
was--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--certified.
mr.
elliott
schulder
a
preliminary
injunction
was
not
ever
issued.
the
case
is
still
pending
technically
in
the
district
court
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
our
position
is
that
the
census
act
establishes
an
absolute
privilege,
and
in
fact
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
seem
to
indicate
that
there
was
an
absolute
privilege
established
by
the
census
act.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
well,
counsel
for
denver
points
out
that
the
only
specific
language
in
the
census
act
that
actually
immunizes
census
bureau
or
census
information
from
discovery
and
lawsuits
is
the
legislation
that
was
enacted
after
st.
regis
that
discusses
retained
copies
by
census
respondents,
but
if
his
theory
is
correct,
that
would
mean
that
copies
of
individual
reports
could
be
discoverable
if
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
census
bureau,
and
that
simply
cannot
be
the
case,
and
the
court
in
st.
regis
made
it
quite
clear
that
census
information
in
the
hands
of
the
census
bureau
simply
was
not
discoverable
in
any
judicial
or
administrative
proceeding.
thank
you
very
much.
