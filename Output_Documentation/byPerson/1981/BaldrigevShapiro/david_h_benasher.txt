mr.
david
h
ben-asher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
one
of
first
impression,
and
it
is
most
properly
framed
as
follows.
is
a
bare
list
of
undifferentiated
street
addresses
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
bureau
of
the
census
absolutely
privileged
from
disclosure
and
furnishing
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
our
position
is
that
title
13
does
not
provide
a
blanket
of
confidentiality
for
all
census
materials,
but
rather
is
restricted
exclusively
to
barring
disclosure
of
information
which
would
identify
any
individual
census
respondent.
that
is
the
conclusion
which
has
been
reached
by
the
third
circuit,
by
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
stevens
in
the
second
circuit
in
carey
versus
klutznick,
and
by
the
district
courts
of
colorado,
new
york,
and
new
jersey.
what
the
county
of
essex
is
not
seeking
in
this
case
is
access
to
vacancy
information,
to
use
information,
to
occupancy
information,
or
as
to
units,
and
it
is
not
seeking
discovery,
and
it
is
not
seeking
at
this
juncture
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
census.
rather,
the
county's
purpose
is
to
ascertain
what
addresses,
if
any,
have
been
overlooked
by
the
bureau,
with
the
result
that
those
addresses
would
not
have
been
canvassed,
and
any
persons
residing
within
those
addresses
would
not
have
been
included,
and
the
census
resulting
in
an
undercount.
the
starting
point
in
the
analysis
of
this
request
of
necessity
must
be
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
that
is
a
statute
which
stands
high
in
the
hierarchy
of
various
legislative
enactments
in
this
area.
the
clear
mandate
of
that
statute
is
full
public
access
to
government
records,
subject
only
to
very
carefully
delineated
exceptions,
which
must
be
narrowly
construed
and
which
the
government
has
the
burden
of
establishing
in
every
case.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
the
1974
amendments,
your
honor,
were
fairly
narrow.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
the
emphasis
there,
your
honor,
was
assuring
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
would
not
involve
further
incursions
into
whatever
privileges
and
confidentiality
was
established
by
the
exception
to
the
census
act,
and
that
is
the
theme
which
runs
throughout
the
entire
legislative
history.
well,
there
has
been
a
certain
narrowing
of
the
exception.
it
has
always
been
a
carefully
constructed
one,
so
as
to
avoid
a
ban
on
all
census
data,
which
would
have
been
a
rather
facile
means
of
accomplishing
that
result
had
it
been
intended
by
congress,
but
rather,
a
focusing
on
how
that
information
might
be
damaging
to
an
individual,
and
to
what
extent
it
might
reveal
his
or
her
identity.
the
thrust
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
to
create,
in
effect,
a
presumption
that
information
is
disclosable
to
the
public
because
it
is
so
critical
to
the
public's
participation
in
the
governmental
process
in
a
democracy
as
the
nature
of
government--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--no,
justice
white.
that
order
was
by
the
court--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--that
is
correct.
it
is
our
position
that
that--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--that's
correct.
it
is
our
position
that
that
order
was
not
required,
though
it
is
authoritized
because
section
23
of
the
census
act
expressly
provides
that
local
government
officials
may
be
sworn
in
to
the
extent
that
they
are
assisting
the
bureau.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
no,
they
would
take
an
oath
in
the
bureau
not
to
reveal
information,
to
which
oath
various
consequences
would
attach.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
it
might
be
directed
in
a
discovery
context,
or
in
a
freedom
of
information
act
litigation
context,
but
certainly
not
if
freedom
of
information
act
requests
were
honored
directly
by
the
governmental
agency.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
it
conceivably
could
be.
vacancy
information
is
not
sought
by
the
county
of
essex
in
this
case,
and
there
is--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--it
is
our
position
that
vacancy
data
would
not
be
included
within
the
category
of
information
that
discloses
information
about
individuals,
but
i
would
concede
that
it
goes
further
towards
reaching
that
line
than
does
the
bare
address
information,
which
is
undifferentiated
as
to
use
or
occupancy,
which
is
being
sought
by
the
county.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
under
the
district
court's
order
herein,
yes.
under
the
position
for
which
we
contend
it
would
not
be
protected
beyond--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--it
would
not
be
effective,
and
it
should
not
be
effective
because
the
data
on
its
face
does
not
provide
any
information
as
to
individuals,
and
that
is
the
prescription
in
the
exceptions
to
the
census
act.
by
the
same
token,
as
perhaps
i
will
discuss
later,
much
of
the
block
data
which
is
published
by
the
census
bureau
as
part
of
its
decennial
census
reveals
as
much
as
if
not
more
information
that
could
be
utilized
in
that
manner,
presuming
some
kind
of
herculean
investigatory
effort
on
the
part
of
members
of
the
public
who
might
choose
to
treat
information
in
that
manner,
but
it
would
not
be
a
manner
which
would
be
harmful
to
individual
census
respondents
or
to
the
confidentiality
purposes
of
the
statute.
the
primary
purpose
of
congress,
as
this
court
has
enunciated
in
enacting
the
freedom
of
information
act,
was
to
assure
that
government
would
not
attempt
to
hide
its
mistakes,
and
that
is
precisely
the
purpose
which
the
county
in
this
case
is
attempting
to
avoid,
to
engage
in
this
process
and
meaningfully
participate
in
the
review
process
so
as
to
help
assure
that
there
will
not
be
an
undercount
in
such
a
critical
area
in
which
the
constitution
has
directed
enactment
of
this
statutory
scheme
for
the
purposes--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--did
the
government
make
an
allegation
that
essex
county
had--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--i
don't
recall
any
such
allegation.
in
fact,
when
local
review
figures
were
submitted
by
the
county
without
the
benefit
of
the
address
lists
in
the
first
stage
of
local
review
approximately
30,000
individuals
were
added
to
the
count
for
essex
county.
so,
disclosure
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
the
general
rule.
the
exception
is
one
which
the
government
must
establish
under
its
burden,
and
it
must
do
so
in
a
de
novo
trial,
in
which
there
is
an
opportunity
to
challenge
and
obtain
judicial
review
of
their
determinations.
the
census
act
itself,
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
determination
which
this
court
must
make,
is
one
which
must
be
examined
in
the
context
of
the
recognition
that
it
is
the
interest
of
the
citizenry
as
opposed
to
the
interest
of
the
bureau
which
is
primary,
and
that
the
confidentiality
provisions
of
the
statute
were
enacted
precisely
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
there
would
be
an
accurate
census
and
that
individual
would
participate
in
that
census.
section
9,
9(a)
of
that
statute
is
one
which
is
exclusively
directed
towards
affecting
the
activities
of
census
bureau
personnel.
that
is,
that
they
should
not
engage
in
abuses
with
that
information
when
it
is
in
their
hands,
such
as
using
it
for
personal
gain,
not
that
it
should
affect
the
public.
that
section
has
nothing
to
do
with
disclosure.
even
the
petitioners
concede
in
their
court
of
appeals
brief
that
9(a)(1)
is
not
intended
to
create
standards
and
criteria
for
release
of
information
to
the
public.
this
court
has
directed
itself
and
concurred
in
that
conclusion
in
the
st.
regis
case,
and
the
express
introductory
language
to
9(a)
indicates
that.
if
in
fact
9(a)(1)
were
construed
to
apply
to
the
citizenry,
then
citizens
could
only
use
published
census
data
to
the
extent
that
it
was
not
used
for
non-statistical
purposes,
and
that
is
not
a
workable
standard,
and
it
is
not
one
that
the
congress
conceivably
could
have
intended
once
information
was
in
the
hands
of
the
public.
so,
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
irrelevant
whether
or
not
there
is
a
statistical
purpose
on
the
part
of
an
inquirer
under
the
statute.
alternatively,
if
section
9(a)
does
require
a
statistical
purpose,
it
is
clear
that
the
purpose
of
essex
county
in
this
case
is
statistical
in
nature
because
it
is
directed
towards
enhancing
the
accuracy
of
the
enumeration,
the
precise
goal
for
which
the
bureau
was
created.
whatever
the
meaning
of
section
9,
it
describes
section
8
as
the
exception
to
its
prohibitions,
and
because
9
does
not
prohibit
the
disclosure
of
this
information
we
need
not
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
section
8
permits
it.
rather,
the
authorization
section
here
for
this
disclosure
is
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
section
8(b)
does
require
the
disclosure
of
statistical
materials,
and
any
reasonable
reading
of
that
term
semantically
must
conclude
that
the
address
lists
are
indeed
statistical
materials.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
justice
o'connor,
our
reading
of
9(a)(2)
is
that
it
applies
only
to
the
bureau,
but
that
we
must
carefully
examine
its
content--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--because
it
helps
us
interpret
the
meaning
of
9--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--yes,
and
certainly
the
county
does
not
contend
that,
as
the
government
represents,
that
it
is
limited
to
individuals.
the
interpretation
of
9(a)(2),
to
the
extent
that
that
language
helps
us
construe
the
meaning
of
the
prohibitions
in
8(b)
is
critical
to
the
case,
you
are
correct,
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
referring
to
that
data,
congress
intended
to
bar
the
disclosure
of
information
which
would
identify
any
particular
individual.
the
government
argues
that
9(a)(2)
means
that
what
is
prescribed
as
the
disclosure
of
identifiable
data
relating
to
individuals.
well,
of
course,
all
census
data
relates
to
individuals,
but
that
test
is
more
amorphous
and
more
unworkable
and
less
in
keeping
with
the
legislative
intent
than
is
the
test
for
which
we
contend
and
which
appears
more
in
keeping
with
the
language
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
our
test
presents
no
greater
difficulty
in
application,
but
of
course
that
is
not
the
only
standard.
the
congressional
intent
is
the
standard.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
our
test
is
whether
the
data
reveals...
whether
it
identifies
a
particular
individual,
and
that
is
the
theme
that
runs
throughout
the
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
9--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--no.
the
source
is
not
the
focus.
and
the
location
of
the
data
in
the
records
is
not
the
basis
for
the
inquiry.
the
question
is
as
to
what
it
discloses,
what
the
nature
and
content
of
that
data
is.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
there
are
difficulties
that
all
the
parties
have
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
here,
not
only
because
it
is
vague,
but
because
some
of
its
literal
interpretation
leads
to
absurd
results.
for
example,
as
you
point
out,
if
what
was
precluded
was
information
that
was
submitted
by
an
individual,
then
in
fact
the
bureau
would
be
incapable
of
publishing
its
decennial
census,
because
that--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--well,
the
authority
section
here
is
8(b),
and
that
includes
the
standard
for
which
we
contend.
if
the...
by
the
same
token,
the
united
states
contends
that
our
position
is
that
if
the
information
appears
on
any
document
other
than
the
report
itself,
that
it
is
disclosable.
but
of
course
again
that
is
not
our
position.
we
are
focusing
on
the
content
of
the
information
as
opposed
to
its
location,
and
st.
regis
dealt,
justice
o'connor,
with
the
point
you
raise
as
to
the
meaning
of
9(a)(2).
i
think
the
reference
in
the
st.
regis
case
by
this
court
to
that
statute
is
even
a
narrower
reading
than
the
one
for
which
the
county
contends,
because
there
it
was
characterized
as
referring
to
the
name
or
identity
of
those
furnishing
information
being
revealed.
the
bureau
implies
that
if
information
can
lead
to
further
information
about
an
individual,
it
would
be
barred
under
the
meaning
of
the
exception
to
the
census
act.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
no,
any
data
which
is
submitted
by
an
individual
is
not
prohibited
from
disclosure.
it
is
only
if
it
identifies
an
individual.
i
think
we
have
made
that
clear
throughout
our
brief
and
my
argument.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
neither
does
the
statute
expressly
utilize
the
language
which
the
bureau
is
contending
for,
but
what
we
are
attempting
here
to
do
and
what
the
court's
duty
to
do
is
to
construe
the
language
in
a
common
sense
way
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
and
its
practical
application,
and
what
we
have
said
is
that
if
that
section
is
applied
mechanically,
it
would
bar
our
information,
but
it
would
also
bar
the
bureau
from
publishing
the
forms
which
it
generally
publishes
as
a
result
of
the
decennial
census.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
what
we
are
asking
for,
justice
marshal,
is
the
comprehensive
master
address
register
which
the
bureau
maintains
as
it
exists
at
the
time
of
a
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
what
is
on
that
list
are
a
number
of
items
which
are
correctly
characterized
by
the
government,
but
we
are
not
seeking
all
of
the
items
on
that
register.
we
are
only
seeking
what
is
found
in
column
2
and
3
of
the
sample
master
address
register
which
is
attached
to
the
multi-district
litigation
brief,
which
is
that
showing
the
number
of
a
lot
and
the
street
name
of
the
lot.
that
is
exclusively
what
we
have
sought
throughout
this
case.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
there
are
various
versions
of
lists
that
are
available
from
various
sources,
but
what
has
not
been
available
to
this
point
is
the
bureau's
address
list,
and
that
is
the
one
that
the
government
correctly
characterizes
as
being
at
the
core
of
the
census
process.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
we
don't
want
the
list.
we
want
the
list
as
it
has
been
redacted
to
remove
all
material,
literally
every
source
of
material
and
nature
of
material
other
than
the
addresses
themselves.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
oh,
without
question,
and
which
only
they
have.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
which
is--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--well,
i
don't
know
what
degree
of
work
is--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--it
has
been
compiled
by
a
number
of
sources.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
it
did,
and
it
gathered
that
information
from
a
number
of
sources.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
well,
there
is
nothing
to--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--it
is
information
that
was
given
to
them
by
postal
inspectors.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
well,
to
the
extent
that
human
effort
is
involved
in
mechanically
collecting
these
addresses,
that's
correct.
it's
from
a
number
of
sources.
it
is
pre-collected
in
effect
and
represents
a
passive
effort
of
the
bureau
to
a
certain
extent,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
not
the
test.
the
ultimate
question
under
the
act
is
whether
the
data
identifies
individuals,
and
that
it
does
not
do
here.
their
list
of
street
addresses
will
not
disclose
the
identity
of
an
individual
who
provided
information,
the
identity
of
the
people
who
live
there,
how
many
live
there,
whether
anyone
lives
there,
whether
there
is
a
dwelling
there,
whether
it
is
used
for
a
residential
purpose,
whether
it
is
vacant
or
occupied.
none
of
that
information
is
being
sought
by
us.
the
information
being
sought
is
entirely
innocuous.
it
tells
us
nothing
about
individuals,
and
it
is
disclosure
which
should
not
discourage
the
public
from
participating
in
the
census,
and
of
course
their
attitude
is
critical,
but
no...
it
can't
be
reasonably
assumed
that
individuals
are
encouraged
to
participate--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--only
if
this
court
holds
in
our
favor
and
it
is
prepared
next
year
to
hold
that
further
information
is
permissible.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
well,
clearly
information--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--i
think
that
it
is
reasonable
conclude,
mr.
justice,
that
individuals
participate
in
the
census
not
because
they
are
sure
that
there
will
be
no
census
data
whatsoever
disclosed
to
the
public
in
the
course
of
the
census,
but
that
they
will
be
not
identified
or
penalized.
it
would
be
paranoic
for
an
individual
to
unrealistically
speculate
that
because
a
federal
bureau
has
the
designation
of
the
property
on
which
he
may
live--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
they
do
anything
but
agree
with
us
in
terms
of
the
standard
as
to
identifying
individuals.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
that
is
a
result
which
they
could
have
brought
about
very
easily
by
simply
prescribing
the
release--
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
--no,
the
purpose
of
the
congress
was
to
preclude
the
disclosure
of
individually
identifiable
data
which
would
be
harmful
to
an
individual.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
even
clearer.
the
amendment
was
a
very
narrow
one,
directed
towards
precluding
disclosure
of
a
very
narrow
category
of
information.
the
holding
of
this
court
in
st.
regis
was
a
broad
one,
to
the
effect
that
9(a)(1)
and
the
9(a)
sections
applied
only
to
the
government,
and
that
the
statute
did
not
generally
clothe
census
data
with
confidentiality,--
the
response
of
the
congress
could
have...
i
see
that
my
time
is
up,
unless
i
may
complete
my
response.
mr.
david
h
ben-asher
congress
when
it
accomplished
that
1962
amendment
did
not
rethink
or
clarify
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
exception
in
the
statute,
as
it
could
have
easily
by
simply
prescribing
release
of
any
census
data.
rather,
its
response
was
a
very
narrow
one,
to
indicate
that
census
reports
themselves
in
the
hands
of
individuals
could
not
be
the
subject
of
process
by
courts
and
agencies.
