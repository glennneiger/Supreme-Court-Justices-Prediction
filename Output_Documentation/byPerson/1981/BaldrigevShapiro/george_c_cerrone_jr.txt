mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government's
counsel
has
indicated
to
the
court
the
general
chronological
order
of
events
in
the
mcnichols
case.
if
i
may,
i
would
add
only
very
briefly
to
his
description.
one
of
the
very
important
things
that
happened
during
the
census
or
just
subsequent
to
the
actual
census
day
in
colorado
as
well
as
all
through
the
nation
is
what
was
enumerated
or
described
as
a
local
review
program.
this
local
review
program
has
been
mentioned
by
the
government
as
being
an
opportunity
wherein
the
local
governments
and
local
officials
can
participate
in
the
review
of
the
census.
one
of
the
things
that
is
in
the
record,
and
which
i
feel
obligated
to
bring
forward
to
the
court,
is
the
fact
that
whether
or
not
and
to
what
extent
living
units
were
vacant
could
not
be
discussed
was
not
an
issue
in
the
local
review
program.
subsequent
to
that,
the
city
and
county
of
denver
did
file
our
action,
and
have
made
our
request,
but
prior
to
making
our
request,
we
had
a
hearing
before
the
district
court
on
our
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
at
that
hearing,
we
presented
evidence
showing
very
clearly,
i
believe,
that
the
total
count
of
the
population
of
the
city
and
county
of
denver
was
too
low,
and
the
total
count
of
the
vacancy
units,
that
is,
the
living
units
in
the
city
and
county
of
denver
was
too
high,
and
that
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
the
too
high
vacancy
rate
and
the
too
low
population
count.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
count
people
who
lived
in
these
what
they
felt
were
vacant
units.
the
district
court,
after
having
heard
this
testimony,
and
having
heard
all
of
the
rest
of
it
at
the
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
issued
its
order
which
was
very
restrictive,
and
obviously
it
issued
its
order
under
rule
26.
it
indicated
that
we
could
only
have
lists
of
units
that
the...
of
addresses
of
units,
living
units
which
the
bureau
deemed
to
be
vacant
on
census
day,
and
no
other,
that
these
lists
or
whatever
it
was
that
this
information
was
kept
on
could
be...
should
be
redacted
to
eliminate
all
reference
to
the
source
or
the
respondent
who
provided
whatever
information
led
to
the
conclusion
or
the
deduction
that
the
unit
was
vacant--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is...
the
order
is
also
in
our
petition.
i
believe
it
is
both
in
the
joint
appendix
and
in
our
petition.
the
order
is
very
clear
also
that
there
shall
be,
as
this
court
has
indicated
a
problem
this
morning,
or
this
afternoon,
there
shall
be
no
what
is
referred
to
as
secondary
disclosure,
that
once
this
information
is
in
the
hands
of
officials
or
employees
of
the
city
and
county
of
denver
who,
incidentally,
must
be
sworn
to
the
same
oath
as
are
the
employees
of
the
bureau
who
also
are
subject
to
the
contempt
powers
of
the
court
because
the
court
made
this
order
specifically
applicable
to
them
and
ordered
that
it
be
served
upon
each
and
every
one
of
them.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
insofar
as
the--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
claim
that
the
information
is
available
under--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
once
we
are
provided
with
the
information
regarding
what
they
deduced
to
be
vacant
units,
what
we
intended
to
do
and
what
we
told
the
court
we
were
going
to
do,
and
what
we
asked
the
court
to
order
them
to
do
in
cooperation
with
us,
is
to
compare...
to
go
out
and
ascertain
whether
or
not
those
units
were
actually
vacant.
our
information
and
our
evidence
at
trial
was
that
there
weren't
as
many
vacant
units
as
they
deduced
to
be--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
they
would
have
complied
with
the
order,
which
was
made
on
september
17th,
it
would
have
been
about
four
or
five
months.
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
it
is
going--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--there
is
no
question,
chief
justice,
that
it
is
going
to
be
an
awful
long
time,
probably
some
time
in
1982,
depending
upon
how
long
all
of
these
proceedings
take.
but,
your
honor,
the
testimony
also
at
the
trial
was
to
the
effect
that
these
kinds
of
facts
can
be
determined
subsequent
to
the
day
in
which
you
are
trying
to
determine
the
existence
of
the
fact.
in
fact,
your
honor,
our
witnesses,
which
were
generally
the
appraisers
and
assessors
of
the
city
who
conducted
our
own
small
survey,
testified
to
the
fact
that
that
is
what
most
governments
do
in
any
event.
we
determine
facts
which
pre-existed
the
time
in
which
we
determine
them.
there
is
no
question
it
is
going
to
be
difficult,
but,
your
honor,
we
have
already
shown
in
a
preliminary
fashion
that
there
is
a
problem
in
the
city
and
county
of
denver,
and
that
that
problem
has
got
to
be
resolved,
and
the
reason
it
has
got
to
be
resolved
is
because
we
are
dealing
with
such
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
namely,
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
the
figures
that
they
have
were
16,000.
there
are
223,000--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--the
testimony--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
the
testimony
in
the
trial
court
was
that
it
would...
assuming
that
everything
got
ginned
up
and
so
forth,
and
was
prepared
properly,
that
it
would
take
five
to
seven
weeks.
that
is
the
actual
going
out
and
determining--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--pardon?
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
that
was
the
estimate
of
the
city,
and
the
estimate
of
the
bureau
was
very
similar.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
most
of
these
units,
your
honor,
are
normally
and
usually
in
apartment
buildings,
and
those
areas
where
there
is
an
aggregation,
in
the
core
city.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
suburbs,
or
where
you
can
go
down
just
a
nice
row
of
houses
and
start
counting
little
children
and
so
forth.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
colorado
case,
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
gain
the
number
of
persons
required
to
change
the
apportionment
of
the
435
seats
in
congress.
but
to
answer
your
question
fully,
it
may
very
well
be
that
as
a
result
of
our
success,
other
localities
may
feel
that
they
should
challenge
the
census
in
a
like
fashion
that
we
have,
and
it
is
possible
that
the
numbers
may
be
such
that
it
will
result
in
such
a
consequence.
my
answer,
your
honor,
is
very
simple,
that
if
in
the
event
that
there
was
a
miscount
in
new
mexico,
or
if
there
was
an
undercount
in
new
york,
or
wherever
it
happens
to
be,
then
that
has
got
to
be
corrected.
the
question
that
was
posed
by
one
of
the
justices
earlier
regarding...
regarded
the
expediency,
and
the
chief
justice
also
mentioned
the
time
which
it
would
take
us
to
do
this,
but
also
the
uses
to
which
the
census
data
are
put,
and
we
all
know
that
in
1982
we
are
going
to
have
a
national
election
for
the
house
of
representatives,
and
in
fact
in
colorado
we
have
a
governor's
race
and
so
forth,
that
obviously
these
kinds
of
data
are
going
to
be
used
for
those
purposes.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
problems.
yes,
your
honor.
because,
for
instance,
if--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--your
honor,
every
suit
that
i
am
familiar
with--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--there
is
no
requirement
under
the
constitution--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--there
is
no--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--there
is
no
requirement
in
the
constitution
or
the
statutes
or
any
case
of
this
court
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
states
must
use
federal
census
data
for
reapportionment,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
every
one
of
them
do,
and
the
reason
that
they
do
is
because
it
is
the
only
game
in
town.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--this
court
in
burns
versus
richardson
has
held
that
in
those
events
where
there
is
a
controversy
in
the
apportionment,
and
in
the
event
that
there
would
be
a
controversy
as
to
the
numbers
that
are
in
every
case
submitted
by
the
federal
census,
other
parties
challenging
those
numbers
can
come
up
with
their
own
numbers.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
but,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
those
other
numbers.
we
were
told,
and
the
record
will
show,
prior
to
the
census
not
to
conduct
our
own--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--we
can
do
our
own
census
in
1990,
your
honor,
but
we
can't
do
our
own
census
in
1980.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
we
can
do
our
own
census,
your
honor,
but
not
as
of
april
1,
1980,
number
one,
and
number
two,
your
honor,
we
do
not
have
the
capabilities
that
the
federal
census
bureau
has.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
do
not
disagree
with
everything
they
said
in
their
census
for
the
city
and
county
of
denver.
we
do
not
disagree
as
to
the
number
of
housing
units.
we
do
not
disagree
as
to
where
the
municipal
boundary
is.
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
they
did
right.
they
didn't
count
or
they
didn't
deduce
the
correct
number
of
vacant
units.
they
didn't
count
everybody.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
yes--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--your
honor,
i...
you
are
absolutely
correct,
and
this
was
brought
out
in
the
briefs
for
the
government.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can't
recall
exactly
right
at
the
moment.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
to
continue,
the
issue...
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
we
don't
conduct
our
own
census.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
we
don't
have
the
wherewithal
to
do
it.
we
didn't
gin
up
to
do
it.
it
would
cost
us
probably
more
to
get
to
the
point
where
the
census
bureau
is
now...
i
really
don't
know
how
much
of
a
cost.
we
have
no
evidence
as
to
that.
but
the
very
fact
that
they--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--no,
we
haven't.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
in
1970,
your
honor,
we
weren't
aware...
or
our
awareness
of
the
fallibility
and
peacability
of
the
census
bureau
wasn't
as
high
as
it
is
today,
after
having
looked
into
it,
and
after
having
suspected
for
one
reason
or
another
in
1980
that
they
didn't
do
their
job
properly,
we
did
become
aware.
not
only
did
we
become
aware,
but
50,
60
other
jurisdictions
have
become
aware.
there
are,
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
50
cases
now
in
a
consolidated
case,
consolidated
by
the
u.
s.
panel
of
multi-district
litigation
in
the
district
in
baltimore,
in
maryland.
justice
stevens
asked
earlier
to
address
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
i
will
address
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
justice
stevens,
by
saying
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute
that
is
applicable
to
a
court
except
how
congress
amended
the
act
with
respect
to
respondent
retaining
copies,
and
that
is
the
only
place
where
there
is
any
mention
as
to
restrictions
on
judicial
disclosure.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
no,
we
are
not.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
legs
upon
which
our--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--that
is
one
of
the
legs
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
but
we
would
go
further,
and
i
think
we
brought
this
out
in
our
brief,
that...
and
as
the
district
court
held,
that
it
is
obvious
that
there
was
some
sort
of
intent
and
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
this
entire
scheme
in
the
statute,
and
that
in
view
of
that,
that...
and
the
district
court
held
that
the
purposes
and
intent
of
the
statute
can
be
maintained
by
having
a
discovery
order
that
recognizes
the
purposes
and
intent
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
did.
it
has
been...
i
could
characterize
it
as
a
qualified
privilege.
i
can
characterize
it
as
coming
under
the
government
report
doctrine,
all
of
which
has
gone
into
the
brief.
what
i
want
to
say
today,
however,
is
that
the
district
court
recognized,
and
i
think
that
it
was
correct
in
recognizing
that
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
statute
has
to
be
maintained,
if
for
no
other
reason,
for
the
public
perception.
public
perception
is--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--fortunately,
your
honor,
for
my
case
i
don't
think
it
matters.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
it
will
not
be
a
part
of
a
deposition.
what
was
ordered
by
our
district
court
was
that
these
lists
be
provided
to
our
people,
who
have
already
been
sworn
to
secrecy,
and
that
they
use
these
lists
to
go
out
and
check
the
vacancies.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
the
district
court
also
suggested...
he
recognized
that
he
couldn't
order...
i
think
he
could
have
ordered,
but
he
did
not
order,
but
he
suggested
that
the
bureau
go
along
with
us,
have
somebody
come
along
with
our
people
when
they
go
out
there
and
check
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
vacant,
and
that
would
increase
the
speed
at
which
this
can
be
done.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
as
i
was
starting
to
say
with
justice
white,
there
are
two
conditions
under
which
this
information
was
made
available
to
us,
not
only
the
protective
orders,
but
the
fact
that
we
had
shown
in
an
application
on
preliminary
injunction
in
which
one
of
the
issues
is
the
likelihood
of
success,
we
showed
that
we
had
something
there.
we
showed
that
it
wasn't
a
frivolous
action,
that
we
were...
that
the
purposes
of
our
asking
for
this
information
were
the
same
purposes
for
which
it
is
used
by
the
census
bureau,
that
is,
ensuring
an
accurate
count
of
the
people
of
the
city
and
county
of
denver.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
suppose
we
can.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
it
goes
right
to
the
issue
of
the
case
in
total.
the
issue
of
our
case
is
whether
or
not
their
list
of
vacancy
units
is
correct.
the
court
has
given
them
the
opportunity
to
come
along
with
us
to
verify
it.
if
their
list
is
correct,
it
is
correct.
if
it
isn't,
then
we
are
going
to--
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
--your
honor,
as
i
have
indicated
earlier,
it
is
going
to
be
difficult,
and
especially
in
view
of
this
protracted
litigation,
but
it
can
be
done
and
it
must
be
done.
it
must
be
done
because,
as
the
court
knows,
this
case
and
especially
in
our
locality,
in
our
region,
has
gotten
an
awful
lot
of
publicity.
the
public
perception
has
been
mentioned
before,
and
i
think
that
the
public
will
be
able
to
distinguish
when
this
court
has
approved
a
discovery
order
with
all
the
protections
that
are
involved.
i
don't
think
that
the
press
is
going
to
mislead
them,
and
i
think
that
they
are
intelligent
enough
to
make
the
distinction.
but
they
also
know
that
the
city
and
county
of
denver
believes
that
its
people
were
not
correctly
counted.
mr.
george
c.
cerrone,
jr.
your
honor,
and
that
is
exactly,
i
believe,
why
the
district
court
required
that
our
people
be
deputized
in
the
words
of
justice
rehnquist,
that
is,
sworn
to
the
same
type
of
secrecy
that
the
regular
bureau
people
are,
because
that
is
exactly
what
this
fellow
is
going
to
do.
that
is,
the
employee
of
the
city
and
county
of
denver.
he
is
going
to
find
out
that
johnny
jones
lived
there,
and
he
is
going
to
take
johnny
jones'
name
and
give
it
to
them.
and
he
is
going
to
hopefully
forget
it.
but
in
any
event,
as
many
protections
in
that
process
that
are
possible
have
been
made
by
the
district
court.
your
honor,
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court,
or
observation
i
would
make
to
the
court
is,
with
respect
to
the
st.
regis
case,
which
has
been
mentioned
earlier,
the
st.
regis
case
developed
on
the
facts,
as
we
all
know,
that
suddenly
the
ftc
wanted
to
have
respondent
retain
copies
of
census
reports.
this
had
never
happened
before.
there
was
never,
at
least
insofar
as
we
can
tell,
an
occasion
where
another
branch
of
government
wanted
to
have
these
kinds
of
things
which
are
retained
by
the
respondents.
when
this
case
came
to
this
court
almost
18,
20
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
congress
didn't
provide
for
that,
therefore
they
have
to
be
resolved.
that
same
situation
exists
in
this
case.
no
one
really
dreamt,
as
it
was
brought
up
by
some
of
the
questions
that
i
have
answered,
in
'70
and
in
'60
that
we
would,
that
is,
the
localities
would
be
so
aware
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
census
bureau.
no
one
anticipated
that
in
learning
that
there
was
a
problem,
that
we
would
start
asking
for
information
such
as
this,
least
of
all
congress.
this
is
the
identical
situation.
this
statute
which
restricts
the
truth,
this
privilege
must
be
strictly
construed,
just
as
it
was
in
st.
regis,
and
in
the
event
that
congress
doesn't
feel
that
it
is
correct,
in
the
event
that
congress
feels
that
this
is
a
hole
in
the
dike,
that
a
finger
must
be
pushed,
then
it
is
up
to
them
as
they
get
into
st.
regis
to
fill
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
