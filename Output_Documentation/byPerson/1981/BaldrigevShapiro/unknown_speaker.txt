unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
will
your
argument
include
a
discussion
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
of
all
the
statutes.
unknown
speaker
more
or
less
deputizing
them
as
federal
employees.
unknown
speaker
did
that
request
fix
a
time
frame
with
respect
to
the
vacancy?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
obvious
that
a
property
might
be
occupied
in
december
and
vacant
in
march
or
january?
unknown
speaker
i
am
now
addressing
myself
to
the
request,
not
to
the
april
1st
date
of
the
census
bureau.
did
the
request
fix
a
narrow
time
frame,
or
was
it
addressed
to
april
1st?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
i
have
great
problems
with
the
danger
of
somebody's
address
being
turned
loose.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
fine.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
if
we
go
along
with
you
on
your
desired
broad
interpretation
of
9(a)(1),
aren't
we
in
effect
making
(a)(2)
and
(a)(3)
superfluous?
unknown
speaker
so
even
if
they
overlap,
it
is
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
first
to
(1),
would
you
say
that
if
the
court
ordered
the
census
bureau
to
turn
over
an
address
list,
would
the
census
bureau
be
making
use
of
that
address
list
within
the
meaning
of
9(a)(1)?
unknown
speaker
would
be
a
use?
unknown
speaker
then
of
course
justice
blackmun
would
be
right.
if
that
is
a
use,
then
you
don't
need
anything
else--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
under
number
(2),
would
you
tell
me...
maybe
this
overlaps
justice
marshal's
question,
but
how
is
the
disclosure
of
an
address
list...
does
that
in
any
way
come
within
(2),
any
particular
establishment
or...
how
does
that
relate
to
any
individual?
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
relate...
how
does
it
make
any
publication
whereby
the
data
furnished
by
any
particular
establishment
or
individual
under
this
title
can
be
identified?
how,
by
looking
at
an
address
list,
could
you
identify
the
source
of
the
address?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
really
precludes
all
disclosure,
because
any
disclosure
would
include
some
data
that
came
from
somebody.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
rather
strange
way
to
write
that
kind
of
a--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
that
all
would
be
consistent
with
the
view
that
they
were
attempting
to
avoid
the
disclosure
of
individual
responses,
the
copy
of
the
census
report
and
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
this
language
surely
reads
that
way.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
giving
a
list
of
addresses
doesn't
really
tell
you
anything
about
what
was
in
the
response
other
than
the
fact
that
that
address
obviously
was--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
doesn't
necessarily
indicate
that
a
particular
address
was
learned
through
a
response.
it
might
have
also
been
learned
by
the
census
taker
going
out
and
looking
at
the
building.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
and
if
all
you
give
is
a
bunch
of
addresses,
how
does
that
tell
anybody
who
just
has
that
list
which
ones
were
provided
by
individual
responses,
and
which
ones
were
obtained
by
observation?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
tell
from
the
list
which
ones
were.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
instructions
given
to
the
census
takers,
would
they
have
been
justified
in
listing
an
address
as
occupied
by
simply
looking,
say,
at
a
number
plate
on
a
door
and
saying,
there's
a
building,
it
must
have--
unknown
speaker
--well,
unless
their
interest
was
in
protecting
individuals
from
having
their
own
private
information
disclosed.
they
don't
want
to
know...
the
individual
presumably
has
an
interest
in
not
being
identified
as
the
source
of
any
information,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
interest
is
protected
by
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute.
isn't
there
a
difference
between
knowing
whether
i
told
the
census
taker
something
and
having
the
census
taker
report
the
fact?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
how
far
did
the
recent
legislation
in
congress
go
which
was
designed
to
authorize
release
of
data
to
state
or
local
government
officials?
did
it
get
out
of
committee?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
wasn't
sure
how
far
it
had
progressed
in
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent,
if
any,
is
the
confidential
status
of
this
information
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
census
bureau
must
get
on
with
the
job,
and
do
it
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
cutoff
date?
unknown
speaker
when
i
get
this
form,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
what
i
give
them
will
be
confidential,
but
once
i
get
the
form
i
know
that
my
address
is
not
confidential,
don't
i?
because
my
address
is
on
it.
unknown
speaker
and
the
postman
and
everybody
else
who
handled
it.
unknown
speaker
but
nobody
else
can
get
that?
you
are
protecting
me
from
disclosing
my
address.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
is
for
sale.
unknown
speaker
in
any
town
you
can
buy
an
address
list.
right?
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
so
confidential
about
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
they
bought
on
the
public
market.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
are
all
of
these
communications,
are
the
forms
sent
addressed
to
a
person
by
name
or
in
some
instances
is
it
to
the
occupant
of
1370
osceola
avenue?
unknown
speaker
can
the
census
bureau
conceivably
have
the
names
of
every
person
in
the
united
states
in
relation
to
a
particular
street
address
before
they
conduct
the
census?
unknown
speaker
so
in
many
cases
it
must
go
to
the
occupant
of
a
particular
address.
unknown
speaker
and
what
they
are
trying
to
find
out,
among
other
things,
is
the
identity
of
the
occupant
of
the
particular
named
address.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
this
case?
i
thought
this
case
was
limited
to
addresses
only.
unknown
speaker
any
names?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
right.
i
thought
that's
what
the
case
was
about.
unknown
speaker
then
neither
involves
names,
as
i
understand
it.
would
you
agree
that
if
the
addresses
are
not
protected
from
disclosure
by
the
statute,
that
it
would
be
a
proper
interpretation
of
foia
to
require
the
government
to
delete
the
names?
i
think
the
lower
court
said
that.
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
question
then
is
whether
the
addresses
are
confidential,
and
the
question
of
whether
it
is
a
pain
in
the
neck
to
have
to
straighten
out
the
list
is
irrelevant,
because
i
assume
there
would
be
some
burden
involved.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
bottom
line
issue
is
whether
a
bare
list
of
addresses
which
has
been
obtained
in
this
way
is
disclosable
or
not,
isn't
it.
unknown
speaker
might
it
also
not
have
harmful
effects
in
that
we
get
the
1980
decennial
census
in
1988,
too?
unknown
speaker
or
that
are
illegal
aliens?
unknown
speaker
or
that
are
illegal
aliens?
unknown
speaker
how
could
that
follow
from
just
giving
an
address
out?
i
don't
understand.
giving
an
address
doesn't
tell
you
how
many
people
live
there,
or
anything
about--
--or
their
citizenship.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
they
also
get
that
from
a
private
firm?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
available
in
every
city?
unknown
speaker
and
presumably
likewise
the
plaintiffs
here
could
have
gone
out
and
bought
anything
for
sale
on
the
open
market.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
of
the
colloquy
between
mr.
mccloskey
and
ms.
abzug
on
the
floor
during
the
'74
amendments
about
the
census
information?
unknown
speaker
it
is
on
page
18
of
the
government's
brief.
unknown
speaker
did
you
submit
to
the
order
of
secrecy
upon
counsel?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
if
you
win,
i
mean,
if
your
submission
is
accepted,
the
information
that
was
requested
is
public
information.
unknown
speaker
although
in
both
instances
the...
in
both
cases
there
was
an
order
of
secrecy
imposed,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
but
not
sworn
by
the
federal
courts.
unknown
speaker
and
directed
by
the
federal
courts.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
of
any
value
to,
let
us
say,
a
real
estate
operator,
to
find
out
all
the
vacant
houses
on
april
1st
in
newark,
new
jersey,
or
any
other
place?
conceivably,
would
that
be
of
some
value
to
a
real
estate
operator,
or
developer?
unknown
speaker
could
they
get
it
under
the
same
procedure
that
you
are
suggesting
here?
could
a
real
estate
man
say,
i
want
this
information
for
my
own
use?
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
being
protected
if
it
were
given
to
your
clients?
is
it
then...
is
there
any
protection
for
the
secrecy
of
that
information
after
it
is
released
by
the
census
bureau?
unknown
speaker
how
long
do
you
think
that
realistically
that
would
be
effective,
to
keep
it
out
of
the
hands
of
real
estate
speculators,
contractors
wanting
to
renovate
vacant
houses,
or
speculators
wanting
to
buy
vacant
houses?
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
raise
any
theme
of
in
pari
delicto
against
essex
county
about
hiding
mistakes?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
essex
county
had
also
made
some
mistakes
in
the
past?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ben-asher,
how
about
section
9(a)(2),
though,
that
refers
to
the
data
that
is
furnished
to
the
census
bureau?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course--
unknown
speaker
--new
jersey,
of
course,
is
going
to
the
bureau
to
get
the
information,
and
therefore
we
run
into
the
problem.
the
bureau
may
not
release
it,
and
data
must
mean
something
other
than
names
of
individuals,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
would
you
state
again
what
your
test
is
under
9(a)(2)?
unknown
speaker
whether
it
identifies
a
particular
individual,
and
not
whether
it
identifies
a
particular
individual
as
the
source
of
the
data.
unknown
speaker
is
that
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
a
distortion
of
the
plain
language
when
it
says
the
data
furnished
by
an
individual?
unknown
speaker
other
than
it
is
permitted
to
do
so
by
another
section.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
once
more?
it
seems
to
me
your
reading
of
the
section
means
you
lose,
because
under
your
reading,
as
i
understand
it,
if
some
of
the
addresses
on
the
list
were
furnished
by
an
individual,
that
would
be
data
relating
to
a
particular
individual,
and
as
you
read
the
statute
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
to
one
point.
you
want
all
of
the
addresses
that
they
have,
period.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
on
that
list?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
list
available
in
essex
county?
unknown
speaker
you
want
the
government's
list
rather
than
the
list.
unknown
speaker
then
you
do
want
something
that
they
have.
unknown
speaker
and
some
of
their
work.
unknown
speaker
some
of
their
work.
unknown
speaker
it
is
some
of
the
work
of
the
census
bureau.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
get
it
on
a
sheet
except
by
work?
the
bureau
put
it
on
a
sheet,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
now
i
am
getting
worried,
because
as
i
understand
it
congress
wants
to
protect
everything
that
they
did.
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
all
you
wanted
was
something
that
somebody
else
gave
them.
but
now
i
find
you
want
what
they
did,
and
that
to
me
is
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
that
to
me
is
a
problem
for
you,
which
is,
what
you
want
is
their
work.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
an
individual
assume
that
if
you
this
year
disclose
my
address,
the
next
year
you
will
disclose
something
else?
unknown
speaker
then
the
person
could
say
that
we
want
confidentiality,
and
we
will
cooperate
provided
what
we
do
is
confidential,
and
this
court
says,
well,
all
of
it
is
confidential
but
your
address,
and
next
time
this
court
says,
all
is
confidential
but
your
name,
and
then
the
next
is,
all
is
confidential
but
your
occupation.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about,
a
person...
don't
people
think
that
once
you
begin
to
give
up
something,
you...
you
know,
the
old
finger
in
the
dike
business?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
congress
doesn't
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
they
intended
to
protect
all
of
the
confidentiality
they
could
protect
in
the
census
bureau.
unknown
speaker
but
was
that
their
purpose
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ben-asher,
on
that
point,
after
the
st.
regis
paper
case,
in
which
this
court
said
that
certain
copies
of
census
reports
kept
by
a
business
establishment
could
be...
were
not
immune
from
judicial
process,
congress
in
effect
overruled
this
court's
holding,
did
it
not?
and
it
indicated
when
it
did
that
that
it
changed
this
court's
ruling
to
add
further
protection
of
privacy.
now,
let
me
read
you
from
the
senate
report,
and
then
ask
you
to
comment
on
that,
where
it
explained
that
it
was
doing
this
to
ensure
that
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
furnish
statistical
tabulations
or
other
material
to
public
and
private
entities
does
not
extend
to
any
material
which
might
disclose
information
reported
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
respondent.
isn't
that
a
pretty
clear
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
can
respond
to
my
question,
if
you
would,
mr.
ben-asher.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
is
that
order
in
the
joint
appendix,
mr.
cerrone?
unknown
speaker
you
made
a
discovery
request.
unknown
speaker
and
so
your
position
is
different
from
your
colleague
from
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
claim
that
the
information
is
available
to
the
public.
unknown
speaker
is
available
to
a
litigant
and
discoverer.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
discovery
after
you
have
got
it
on
paper?
where
does
it
go?
unknown
speaker
how
long
after
april
1st,
1980,
on
an
average,
would
that
litigation
process
take
place,
on
the
present
scale?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
comply
with
the
order.
i
am
talking
about
the
situation
that
realistically
exists
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
as
a
guess,
if
you
know,
about
how
many
vacant
units
or
alleged
vacant
units
would
you
think
would
exist
in
denver
as
of
april
1,
1980?
a
hundred?
five
hundred?
unknown
speaker
sixteen
thousand.
now,
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
you
to
develop
the
historical
facts
with
respect
to
each
one
of
these
with
witnesses
and
cross
examination
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
maybe
a
day
for
each
residence?
unknown
speaker
whose
estimate
was
that?
unknown
speaker
whose
estimate
was
that?
unknown
speaker
of
16,000
units?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
quite
possible
that
in
the
course
of
that
litigation
new
mexico,
or
nebraska,
or
utah
might
seek
to
intervene,
saying
that
if
colorado
is
going
to
hold
onto
a
seat
or
gain
two
seats,
we
run
the
risk
of
losing
one
seat
or
only
gaining
one
seat,
and
that
that
sort
of
legal
issue
is
going
to
be
floating
up
and
down
in
the
case,
too?
unknown
speaker
how?
you
say
you
couldn't
come
up
with
enough
extra
numbers
to
get
colorado
another
seat.
unknown
speaker
so
is
it
really
just
a
question
then
of
where
you
draw
the
lines?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
know
that
census
data
necessarily
was
binding
on
courts
in
apportionment
suits.
unknown
speaker
is
it?
unknown
speaker
not
in
our
cases.
unknown
speaker
our
cases
don't
say
that
apportionment
suits
are
necessarily
governed
by
census
figures.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
somebody
sues,
and
says
denver...
if
somebody
in
denver
sues
and
says
we
are
underrepresented
here
as
compared
with
the
other
districts
in
our
state,
they
aren't
necessarily
stuck
with
the
census
figures.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
awfully
convenient
to
have
them.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
do
your
own
census.
you
can
do
your
own
census.
unknown
speaker
you
can
do
your
own
census
for
purposes
of
a
reapportionment
suit.
unknown
speaker
you
can
make
your
own
count
on
vacancies.
unknown
speaker
you
can
make
your
own
count
on
vacancies
and
say,
we
came
up
with
10,000
and
the
census
bureau
came
up
with
16,000,
and
they
are
just
wrong.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
in
burns
and
richardson,
does
my
memory
serve
me
correctly?
didn't
we
approve
the
use
of
registered
voters
as
the
basis
there
for
hawaiian
apportionment?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
i
ought
to
remember.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
never
ginned
up
to
do
it,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
and
in
1970
there
was
no
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
making
any
claim
under
foia
then.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
contend
there
is
just
no
privilege
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
your
point
about
no
mention
of
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
saying,
well,
sure,
this
information
is
covered
by
section
9,
confidentiality,
but
the
congress
didn't
want
to
keep
it
from
being
discovered
in
litigation
as
long
as
the
court
entered
a
proper
order
that
would
protect
the
secrecy
of
it.
so
long
as...
so
long
as
two
things,
justice
white.
not
only
that
the
court
order
a
proper
protection
order--
--so
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
from
new
jersey,
or
do
you,
that
section
9
reaches...
protects
this
information,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
can
say,
assume
that
it
does.
the
court
amply
protected
it.
unknown
speaker
how
long
do
you
think
it
could
remain
protected,
once
it
is
part
of
a
deposition
or
other
pretrial
discovery?
unknown
speaker
and
this
would
be
an
in
camera
analysis
by
the
judge
and
the...
presumably
the
lawyers
in
opposition?
unknown
speaker
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
be
before
the
denver
post
and
the
other
newspaper
out
there
would
be
in
court
either
as
an
intervenor
or
plaintiff
to
stop
this
pernicious
secrecy?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
might
have
a
tendency
to
slow
up
the
whole
litigation
process?
unknown
speaker
you
could
show
that
the
taking
of
a
census
was
not
a
traditional
first
amendment
place
where
people
gather
to
discuss
public
issues,
too,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
it
is
sort
of
ironic,
i
suppose.
under
your
opponent's
reading
of
the
statute,
they
couldn't
rebut
your
case
by
putting
in
their
own
list
of
vacant
places,
either,
could
they?
i
suppose
they
couldn't
use
the
information
in
court
in
order
to
defend
the
accuracy
of
their
own
results.
unknown
speaker
well,
going
along
with
you
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
question
whether
it
was
vacant
on
april
1st
of
1980,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
trouble
with
me
is,
you
want
to
keep
the
names
confidential,
you
do
and
the
government
does.
so
you
go
out
and
you
find
that
this
house
which
the
government
said
was
vacant
on
april
1
wasn't
really
vacant,
it
was
occupied
by
john
jones.
now,
there
is
his
name
right
out
in
the
public.
unknown
speaker
in
the
mcnichols
case,
suppose
they
filed
an
affidavit
or
a
series
of
affidavits
which
showed
that
100
percent
of
the
houses
you
declared
vacant
were
actually
occupied
on
april
1.
how
would
you
go
about
disputing
that?
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
did
not.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
disputed
them.
and
disputed
the
city's
figures.
how
would
that
be
resolved?
in
a
court?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
where
you
were
going
to
end
up.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
is
your
position,
that
you
can't
just...
you
can't
get
in
court
on
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
tough
tacos.
unknown
speaker
tough
tacos.
ask
justice
rehnquist.
he
will
tell
you
what
it
means.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
take
that
position,
because
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
which
may
be
right,
you
couldn't
put
in
countervailing
evidence
on
specific
locations,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
so
you
almost
have
to
take
the
position
that
this
sort
of
issue
doesn't
belong
in
court.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
go
even
beyond
the
statute?
doesn't
it
come
down
to
the
question
of,
under
the
constitution,
what
entity
is
charged
with
conducting
the
census,
the
executive
branch,
the
legislative
branch,
or
the
judicial
branch?
unknown
speaker
how
do
the
plaintiffs
get
into
court
here?
unknown
speaker
how
about
denver?
unknown
speaker
under
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
census
act
itself
invite
suits
by
either
public
agencies
or
private
parties?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
they
proceed
under
any,
as
you
would
under
any
denial
of
a
person
to
supply
information
under
discovery,
under
the
rules?
but
you
have
got
to
be
in
court
first.
what
was
the
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
for
what?
is
there
some
implied
cause
of
action
under
the
census
statutes,
or
what?
on
page
8
of
the
appendix,
you've
got
about...
you've
got
from
a
to
i
reasons,
none
of
which
are
too--
--well,
i
just
thought...
apparently
the
government
doesn't
raise
any...
no
one
raises
any
objection
to
the
parties
being
informed.
unknown

your

in

tenth
circuit
case
didn't

unknown

certified.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
preliminary
injunction?
yes,
there
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
they
have
gone
to
it
in
part
at
least
on
a
claim
for
judicial
review
of
administrative
action.
that
is
the
allegation
in
the
complaint.
mr.
schulder,
i
guess
your
case
is
a
little
more
difficult,
isn't
it,
in
the
mcnichols
situation,
where
we
are
dealing
with
possibly,
anyway,
only
a
qualified
privilege
as
far
as
a
judicial
discovery
order
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
even
though
congress
didn't
expressly
say
so--
unknown
speaker
--although
it
does
in
many
instances.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o
clock.
