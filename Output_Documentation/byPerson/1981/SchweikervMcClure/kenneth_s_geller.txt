mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
and
united
states
against
erika,
the
following
case,
involve
challenges
to
the
procedures
established
by
congress
for
determining
medical
reimbursement
claims
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program.
the
medicare
program
is
divided
into
two
parts.
part
a
provides
insurance
for
hospital
and
related
post-hospital
services,
and
is
fully
funded
by
payroll
taxes
paid
to
the
federal
government
through
the
social
security
system.
part
b,
which
is
involved
here,
provides
a
voluntary
program
of
supplementary
medical
insurance
covering
in
general
80
percent
of
the
reasonable
charges
for
certain
other
services,
primarily
physicians'
services
and
such
items
as
medical
supplies,
laboratory
tests,
and
ex-rays.
benefits
under
part
b
are
financed
in
part
by
direct
federal
government
contributions
and
in
part
by
monthly
premiums
paid
by
people
who
are
65
years
of
age
or
older
or
disabled
and
who
choose
voluntarily
to
enroll
in
the
part
b
program.
under
the
medicare
statute,
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
determines
whether
an
individual
is
eligible
to
enroll
in
the
part
b
program.
if
the
secretary
determines
that
an
applicant
is
not
eligible,
the
applicant
has
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge,
and
if
necessary,
to
judicial
review
of
that
determination.
now,
in
contrast
to
these
eligibility
determinations,
the
individual
benefit
reimbursement
determinations
under
the
part
b
program
are
not
handled
directly
by
the
secretary.
the
day
to
day
administration
of
the
part
b
program
requires
a
determination
of
a
vast
number
of
individual
claims
for
reimbursement
submitted
by
or
on
behalf
of
some
27
million
beneficiaries.
in
1980
alone,
more
than
150
million
medical
reimbursement
claims
were
processed.
when
it
enacted
the
medicare
act
in
1965,
congress
concluded
that
a
reimbursement
program
of
this
magnitude
and
complexity
could
be
administered
most
efficiently
and
conveniently
by
private
insurance
carriers,
because
these
carriers,
in
conducting
their
own
insurance
business,
had
acquired
considerable
experience
and
expertise
in
determining
whether,
for
example,
physicians'
services
are
medically
necessary
and
in
calculating
the
reasonable
charge
for
a
variety
of
medical
services
in
their
particular
community.
accordingly,
congress
in
the
medicare
act
authorized
the
secretary
to
enter
into
contracts
with
private
insurance
carriers
under
which
the
carriers
would
determine
and
pay
part
b
benefits
on
a
reimbursible
non-profit
basis.
under
these
contracts,
the
carriers
receive
advances
of
funds
which
they
then
pay
to
claimants
in
reimbursement
for
medical
services
that
are
found
by
the
carriers
to
be
covered
by
part
b,
medically
necessary,
and
reasonable
in
amount.
the
contracts
also
provide
for
the
government
to
pay
the
carriers'
necessary
and
proper
costs
of
administering
the
part
b
system.
in
all
of
these
functions,
the
carriers
act
as
agents
of
the
secretary.
now,
the
challenge
in
this
case
is
to
the
procedures
provided
under
part
b
when
a
claimant
is
dissatisfied
with
a
carrier's
reimbursement
decision.
under
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary,
if
a
claimant
does
not
agree
with
the
carrier's
initial
decision
regarding
the
amount
of
reimbursement
for
particular
services,
the
claimant
may
require
a
review
of
that
initial
determination.
a
review
of
the
entire
file
is
then
conducted
by
an
employee
of
the
carrier
other
than
the
employee
who
made
the
initial
determination,
and
the
claimant
may
submit
additional
evidence
or
legal
or
factual
argument
in
support
of
the
claim
at
issue.
if
after
that
review
determination
the
claimant
is
still
not
satisfied
with
the
carrier's
decision,
the
medicare
act
requires
the
carrier
to
hold
a
100
in
controversy.
now,
this
fair
hearing
is
conducted
by
a
hearing
officer
appointed
by
the
carrier
who
cannot
have
participated
personally
at
any
prior
stage
of
the
claim.
the
hearing
officer
is
empowered
to
inquire
fully
into
the
claim
at
issue.
he
may
examine
witnesses
and
call
for
additional
evidence
at
the
hearing,
and
the
claimant
is
also
entitled
to
submit
additional
documents
or
evidence,
examine
witnesses,
and
present
argument.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
i
hope
to
develop
that
point
in
a
little
while.
the
answer
is
that
if
a
claim
is
found
to
be
meritorious,
it
is
paid
out
of
funds
that
are
submitted
to
the
carrier
by
the
secretary.
it
doesn't
come
out
of
the
carrier's
own
pocket,
and
the
hearing
officer's
salary
is
not
affected
in
any
way
by
the
decision
he
reaches
at
these
fair
hearings.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
some
people...
some
of
these
people
are,
i
understand,
full-time
employees
of
the
carrier.
most
of
them
are
simply
independent
contractors
who
are
paid
on
a
hearing
by
hearing
basis,
although
some
of
them
work
so
often
that
it
approaches
a
full-time
position
with
the...
with
the
carrier.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's...
that's
correct,
and
i
assume,
and
we
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
some
of
these
people
may
well
have
that
interest.
what
we
dispute
is
this
notion
that
they
increase
their
chances
of
being
hired
and
rehired
by
denying
meritorious
claims.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
they
are
employed
by
contracts
with
the
carrier,
but
what
is
paid
to
them
by
the
carrier
is
considered
a
necessary
administrative
expense--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
the
carrier
is
reimbursed
by
the
secretary.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
really.
there
are
only
about
100
or
150
hearing
officers
for
the
whole
country.
we
are
talking
about
a
medicare
program
that...
part
b
involves
more
than
ten
million--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--oh,
of
course.
i
mean,
the
hearing
officers
are
an
insignificant
expense
of
the
total
of
the
entire--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
mean,
they...
well,
normally
they
would
be
held,
for
example,
at
the
attorney's
office.
many
of
these
people
are
attorneys.
let
me
put
into
perspective
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
there
are
158
or
in
1980
there
were
158
million
medicare
claims
submitted.
as...
out
of
that
figure,
only
about
two
million
went
beyond
the
stage
of
the
initial
determination
by
the
carrier
and
went
to
the
review
determination
stage,
and
out
of
that
two
million,
there
are
only
about
26,000
that
went
to
the
fair
hearing
stage.
so
the
administrative
expenses
of
the
carriers
would
be
figured
on
processing
158
or
whatever
it
is
million
claims,
and
the
hearing
officer
would
only
be
compensated
for
conducting
a
very,
very
minor
percentage
of
the
total
medicare
picture,
so
the
administrative
expenses
that
are
attributable
to
the
carrier
are
very,
very
small.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the...
this
is
all
laid
out
with...
in
great
detail
in
the
regulations
that
the
secretary
has
promulgated
and
that
are
published
in
cfr.
the
hearing
officer
has
to
follow
the
statute,
obviously.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
those
regulations.
in
addition,
the
secretary
publishes
a
carriers'
manual
and
the
hearing
officer
handbook,
portions
of
which,
by
the
way,
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
to
which
i
would
ask
the
court
to
turn.
and
all
of
those
sources
explain
in
great
detail
to
these
hearing
officers
how
they
are
to
go
about
computing
the
reasonable
charge,
and
frequently
it
is
a...
it
is
a
mathematical
computation.
they
have
to
take
into
account
things
such
as
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
well,
one
of
the
things...
yes.
one
of
the
things
that
the
hearing
officer
has
to
take
into
account
is
the
carrier's
particular
charge
in
his
own...
in
its
own
private
insurance--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
carrier's
private
business
serves
as
a
ceiling
beyond
which
a
medicare
payment
cannot
be
made,
so
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that...
it
is
not
a
floor.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
carrier
in
its
private
business
would
be
hindered
or
in
any
way
encouraged
to
do
anything--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
the
hearing
officer
has
to
take
into
account
in
determining
the
reasonable
charge
the
same
sorts
of
things
that
the
carrier
takes
into
account
in
his
private
business.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
for
example,
the
physicians'
customary
charge,
the
prevailing
charge
in
the
community.
now,
after
the
hearing
officer
has
done
all
of
that,
the
fact
is,
he
still
under
the
statute
cannot
pay
anything
more
than
the
carrier
itself
would
pay
for
the
same
sort
of
claim
in
its
private
insurance
business.
i
think
there
is
an
important
point
to
be
made
here.
we
can't
lose
sight
of
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
due
process
violation,
and
what
the
district
court
advanced
as
the
remedy
for
that
due
process
violation.
how
reasonable
charge
is
figured,
including
the
fact
that
the
reasonable
charge
can't
be
more
than
what
the
carrier
pays
in
its
private
insurance
business,
is
in
the
statute
and
in
the
regulations.
the
administrative
law
judge
that
the
district
court
has
ordered
appointed
in
all
of
these
cases
would
have
to
follow
those
exact
same
procedures
in
figuring
out
what
the
reasonable
charge
is,
so
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
because
the
hearing
officer
is
appointed
by
the
carrier,
that
that
introduces
an
institutional
bias
into
the
system.
the...
how
reasonable
charge
is
computated
is
not
something
that
the
carrier
decides.
it
is
in
the
statute
and
it
is
in
the
secretary's
regulations.
now,
this
care
is
a
nationwide
class
action
brought
on
behalf
of
persons
whose
claim
for
reimbursement
under
part
b
was
denied
in
whole
or
in
part
by
a
carrier
hearing
officer.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
plaintiffs
that
the
part
b
hearing
procedures
established
by
congress
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
the
district
court's
view,
part
b
beneficiaries
are
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
have
final
determinations
with
respect
to
their
claims
for
reimbursement
of
medical
expenses
made
by
hearing
officers
who
are
totally
independent
of
the
carriers
that
administer
the
part
b
program,
and
the
district
court
gave
essentially
two
reasons
for
suspecting
that
the
carriers'
hearing
officers
were
not
and
could
not
be
impartial.
one
was
this
notion
that
justice
o'connor
alluded
to
earlier,
that
perhaps
the
hearing
officers
have
some
financial
interest
in
the
decisions
that
they
make,
and
the
second
reason
that
the
district
court
gave
was
what
the
district
court
termed
the
hearing
officer's
"vicarious
involvement
in
the
claim".
by
that
the
district
court
meant
that
the
hearing
officer
works
for
the
carrier
that
has
twice
before
denied
the
claim,
and
the
notion
is
that
the
hearing
officer
might
be
reluctant
to
overturn
a
decision
made
at
two
previous
levels
of
the
carrier.
what
the...
based
on
these
conclusions,
the
court
struck
down
the
review
provisions
of
the
part
b
medicare
program,
and
ordered
that
the
secretary
afford
the
right
to
a
de
novo
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge
in
the
department
of
health
and
human
service
to
every
person
whose
part
b
claim
was
denied
in
whole
or
in
part
by
a
carrier
hearing
officer
after
may
1,
1980,
provided
that
the
amount
remaining
in
issue
is
at
least
$100.
now,
the
government
has
taken
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
under
28
usc
1252
to
challenge
this
extraordinary
holding
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
has
declared
unconstitutional
the
specific
procedural
mechanism
devised
by
congress
to
deal
with
a
massive
medical
insurance
program
involving,
as
i
said,
some
27
million
beneficiaries,
nearly
200
million
in
this
fiscal
year,
individual
claims
for
reimbursement,
$10.5
billion
worth
of
benefits,
and
in
its
place,
the
district
court
has
ordered
the
secretary
to
establish
an
administrative
review
system
within
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
that
congress
expressly
considered
and
rejected.
now,
in
reviewing
this
decision,
we
believe
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
district
court
in
finding
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
did
not
point
to
anything
in
the
medicare
statute
or
the
secretary's
regulations
to
suggest
that
the
fair
hearings
offered
to
part
b
claimants
by
the
carriers
denied
claimants
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard.
moreover,
the
district
court
did
not
point
to
any
evidence
drawn
from
the
accumulated
experience
of
carrier-conducted
hearings
in
scores
of
thousands
of
cases
over
the
last
16
years
to
demonstrate
that
congress
and
the
secretary
were
wrong
in
believing
that
carriers
could
be
relied
upon
to
conduct
appropriate
hearings
on
these
very
small
claims.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
models?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't...
there
may
not
be
any
models,
but
i
am
not
sure
there
are
any
models
for
the
part
b
medicare
program
to
begin
with.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
to
sort
of
parallel
and
to
create
as
minor
an
inconvenience
as
it
could
for
the
health
care
industry
when
it
set
up
the
part
b
program,
and
therefore
it
assumed
that
the
best
way
to
process
these
millions
and
millions
of
claims
was
to
delegate
that
authority--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
it
is,
but...
but
my
point
is
that
it
is
not
simply
the
review
procedures
that
are
unique.
the
whole
part
b
medicare
program
is
unique,
and
i
think
that
the
review
procedures
have
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
setting
up
in
1965
this
entirely
new
and
unique
program.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the...
well,
in
this
case,
there
is
only
one
alleged
problem.
the
plaintiffs
have
not
challenged
the
absence
of
judicial
review
under
the
statute.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think...
i
think
the
court,
in
considering
this
case
and
in
considering
the
erika
case,
has
to,
in
adjudicating
the
plaintiffs's
claims
in
each
of
those
cases,
consider
the
entire
program,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
considering
whether
procedural
fairness
has
been
met
here,
to
consider
the
fact
that
congress
has
not
allowed
for
judicial
review,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
court
has
to
find
that
the
administrative
process
violates
due
process.
it
is
not
simply
enough
to
sort
of
merge
everything
together
and
say,
well,
it
probably
is
procedurally
proper,
but
it
is
close
to
the
line,
and
since
there
isn't
judicial
review,
we
are
somehow
going
to
restructure
the
administrative
process.
i
don't
think
that
the
courts
have
any
power
to
restructure
the
system
that
congress
has
devised
unless
they
find
that
the
system
in
some
specifically
articulated
way
violates
elementary
due
process,
denying
the
claimant
the
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard,
or
not
an
impartial
decision-maker.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
will
be
able
to
identify
any
aspect
of
the
part
b
hearing
system
in
this
case
that
falls
below
minimal
standards
of
due
process.
it
is
important
to
emphasize,
as
justice
o'connor
asked
me
earlier,
that
neither
the
carriers
nor
the
hearing
officer
have
any
direct
or
indirect
pecuniary
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
the
carriers
administer
the
part
b
program
in
their
particular
locality
on
a
non-profit
basis.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
was
testimony
as
to
that
in
the
record,
and
one
of
the
people
who
is,
i
think,
an
officer
of
the
occidental
life
insurance
company,
testified
that
they
do
it
essentially
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
it
is
very
good
public
relations,
because
millions
and
millions
of
benefit
checks
are
sent
out
with
the
insurance
company's
name
on
them.
and
the
second
reason
that
was
given,
a
more
substantive
one,
is
that
it
helps
the
insurance
companies
achieve
economies
of
scale,
because
they
can
integrate
their
private
insurance
business
for...
i
assume
for
purposes
of
computerization,
for
example.
they
can
rent
a
larger
computer,
and
they
can
achieve
economies
of
scale.
i
am
not
sure
it
is...
i
think...
we
don't...
we
don't
deny
the
fact
that
carriers,
insurance
carriers
would
like
to
be
part
of
the
part
b
program,
but
if
any
inference
can
be
drawn
from
that,
it
is
not
the
inference,
i
think,
that
the
plaintiffs
draw,
which
is
that
they
would
seek
at
every
turn
to
deny
meritorious
claims.
i
think
if
any
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
carriers
would
like
to
be
part
of
the
part
b
program
and
would
like
to
have
their
contracts
renewed
by
the
secretary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
except
that
they
are
obliged
by
the
contract
they
sign
to
follow
the
standards
that
congress
and
the
secretary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
on
reasonable
charge,
but
not,
for
example,
on
what,
for
example,
is
covered
by
the
part
b
program,
or
what
is
a
medically
necessary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
yes,
but
still,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
there
is
any
incentive
on
the
part
of
any
carrier
to
deny
a
meritorious
claim.
it
would
seem
that
if
they
want
to
continue
to
be
part
of
the
part
b
program,
if
they
wanted
to
have
good
public
relations,
they
would
be
scrupulously
fair.
in
fact,
if
any,
as
i
was
saying,
if
any
inference
can
be
drawn
from
this
desire
to
maintain...
to
be
part
of
the
program,
it
might
be
that
they
would...
they
would
grant
benefits
in
non-meritorious
claims,
in
order
to
have
the
benefit
checks
go
out
with
their
name
captioned
on
them.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
necessarily.
i
mean,
many
of
these
cases
are
very,
very
fact-bound,
and
there
is
no
record
kept.
they
are
not
precedents
in
which
they
could
go
back
and
look
and
see
what
they
did
in
a
similar
situation
in
1978.
even
the
plaintiffs
have
not
alleged,
and
believe
me,
the
plaintiffs
have
conjured
up
every
conceivable,
imaginable
way
in
which
the
carriers
or
the
hearing
officers
might
violate
their
solemn
duties.
even
the
plaintiffs
have
not
suggested
that
the
carriers
might
do
that.
now,
the
district
court
acknowledged
that
the
hearing
officer's
fee
in
connection
with
a
given
case
is
unaffected
by
the
decision
he
reaches
in
that
case,
but
the
court
speculated
that
the
hearing
officer
has
a
pecuniary
interest
in
"currying
the
carrier's
favor"
by
ruling
against
the
claimant,
because
the
hearing
officer's
future
income
might
somehow
be
affected
by
how
often
the
carrier
decides
to
call
upon
his
services.
this
concern
again
strikes
us
as
totally
unrealistic
and
fanciful,
and
certainly...
this
is
an
important
point...
is
an
insufficient
reason
to
strike
down
a
federal
statute.
first,
as
i
noted
earlier,
the
carrier
has
no
financial
personal
interest
in
how
a
claim
is
decided.
in
addition,
and
perhaps
more
important,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
carrier
had
ever
engaged
in
conduct
so
improper
as
to
terminate
or
substantially
alter
its
relationship
with
a
hearing
officer
based
upon
how
that
hearing
officer
was
deciding
particular
claims
in
favor
of
part
b
claimants.
in
fact,
the
hhs
official
who
is
responsible
for
monitoring
the
part
b
hearing
process
testified
that
he
didn't
know
of
any
instance
in
which
such
conduct
had
ever
occurred
or
even
been
alleged.
in
fact,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
hearing
officer
had
ever
been
fired
by
a
carrier
for
any
reason.
quite
apart
from
the
lack
of
factual
support
for
the
district
court's
conclusion,
we
submit
there
is
no
support
for
it
in
logic.
to
the
extent
that
a
carrier
wishes
to
ingratiate
himself...
itself
with
the
secretary
in
order
to
maintain
its
medicare
contract,
or
to
the
extent
that
a
hearing
officer
wishes,
to
use
the
district
court's
terms,
to
"curry
favor
with
a
carrier",
we
submit
that
they
would
have
an
exceedingly
strong
incentive
to
correctly
determine
the
amount
of
every
part
b
claim,
and
to
pay
every
meritorious
claim
to
the
full
extent
required
by
statute.
that,
of
course,
is
the
carrier's
contractual
obligation,
and
the
secretary
could
terminate
the
contract
of
any
carrier
that
failed
to
satisfy
that
obligation.
in
fact,
the
secretary
carefully
monitors
the
performance
of
the
hearing
officers
and
the
carriers
in
general
in
at
least
four
different
ways,
perhaps
the
most
important
of
which
is
that
every
three
months,
the
carriers
must
send
to
the
secretary
10
percent
of
their
hearing
decisions,
determined
on
some
random
basis
based
on
the
claimant's
social
security
number,
so
that
every...
and
they
must
send
at
least
one
hearing
decision
from
every
single
hearing
officer,
so
that
allows
the
secretary
to
determine
how
the
process
is
actually
working
and
how
each
hearing
officer
is
adhering
to
the
carriers'
handbook
and
the
hearing
officers'
manual.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
reveals
that,
justice
blackmun,
and
that
is
only
one
of
four
ways
in
which
the...
the
hearing
officers'
and
the
carriers'
carrying
out
of
their
contractual
obligations
are
monitored.
there
is
also
an
on-site
representative
at
every
one
of
these
carriers,
and
he
frequently
will
monitor
a
hearing
officer...
a
hearing
being
conducted
by
a
hearing
officer.
in
addition,
there
is
an
annual
contractual
review
system
whereby
the
secretary
sends
a
fairly
lengthy,
and
the
record
contains
at
least
one
of
these,
a
fairly
lengthy
critique
of
how
the
carrier
is
doing
during
that
year,
and
will
often
have
suggestions.
and
finally,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
even
on
individual
cases,
in
response
to
a
particular
complaint,
the
secretary
will
review
a
hearing
officer's
decision.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
it
is
our
position
that
we
are
entitled
to
summary
judgment,
because
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
the
plaintiffs
have
not
suggested
any
lines
of
factual
inquiry
that
could
lead
a
judge
to
conclude
that
the
part
b
system
violates
due
process.
i
might
add
that
there...
there
were
a
great
amount
of
evidentiary
materials
submitted
here,
both
depositions
and
answers
to
interrogatories,
that
were
submitted
to
the
district
court
both
in
favor
of
and
in
opposition
to
the
plaintiffs'
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
has
ordered,
which
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--apparently,
that
is
what
the
district
court
thought,
although
there
is
a
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
such
as
ward
versus
village
of
monroeville,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
if
there
is
a
bias
at
some
sort
of
adjudicatory
level,
it
is
not
cured
by
having
a
de
novo
level
of
review
on
top
of
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
even
judicial
review.
that's
right.
that
is
what
was
involved
in
a
case
like
ward,
but
the
district
court
here
thought
that
that
would
solve
the
problem,
which
i
think
comes
back,
once
again,
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
simply
had
some
vague
unease
about
how...
the
way
the
system
was
working,
but
he
could
not
really
point
to
any
evidence
of
any
particular
unfairness.
in
fact,
he
went
out
of
his
way
in
the
district
judge's
opinion
to
praise
the
actual
conduct
of
the
hearing
officers.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
in
fact,
the
district
court,
as
i
recall,
pointed
out
that
no
one
had
challenged
the
judicial
preclusion
provisions
of
the
part
b
medicare
act.
therefore,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
reason
to
believe
that
a
carrier
would
jeopardize
its
relationship
with
the
medicare
program
by
exerting
influence
on
a
hearing
officer
to
deny
an
otherwise
meritorious
claim,
or
that
a
hearing
officer
would
act
in
that
unseemly
fashion
on
his
own
in
the
belief
that
it
would
somehow
place...
please
the
carrier
and
make
it
more
likely
that
he
would
be
hired
as
a
hearing
officer
in
the
future.
exactly
the
opposite
is
the
case.
the
hearing
officer
and
the
carrier
have
every
incentive
to
be
scrupulously
fair.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
statistics
show
that
approximately
50
percent
of
the
claims
that
are
submitted
to
the
hearing
officer
are
reversed,
and
that
statistic,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
the
plaintiffs
this
morning,
we
do
not
for
a
minute
suggest
that
those
statistics,
which
have
held
fairly
constant
over
several
years,
are
in
any
way
distorted
or
don't
reflect
realities.
they
also
don't
reflect
computer
coding
errors,
which
is
what
the
plaintiffs
suggested
this
morning.
most
of
those
sorts
of
errors
are
caught
at
the
review
stage,
which
is
the
second
stage
of
the
review.
and
finally,
they
don't
reflect
reversals
where
only
about
50
cents
is
involved,
which
is
another
statement
that
the
plaintiffs
made
this
morning.
the
statistics
in
the
record,
which
are
printed
in
the
joint
appendix,
show
that
the
average
amount
at
issue,
the
average
amount
that
is
reversed
at
these
hearings
is
about
$200,
which
is
a
very
substantial
amount
when,
as
my
opponent
just
answered
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
the
amount
at
issue
in
any
of
these
hearings
total
is
about
$600,
and
even
that
overstates
the
actual
amount
of
each
claim,
because
claims
can
be
aggregated
over
a
six-month
period.
so,
we
think
that
these
statistics
don't
show
any
timidity,
on
the
part
of
hearing
officers
to
reverse
when
they
think
that
the
claim
is
meritorious.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
well,
the
record
does.
i
think
it
varies.
there
are
various
estimates,
because
of
the
manner
of
allocating,
but
it
was
several
hundred
dollars.
in
fact,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
congress
in
1972
put
in...
put
in
this
provision
only
requiring
a
fair
hearing
when
more
than
$100
is
involved,
because
there
was
evidence
that
the
hearings
were
costing
more
than
$150
and
people
requesting
hearings--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
that
would
be
a
decision
for
congress
to
make,
it
would
not
be
a
concern
of
the
hearing
examiner--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
would
be
a
good
reform
for
congress--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
it
is
not
really
that
strange
when
you
consider
that
the
earlier
stages
of
review
are
just
on
paper.
a
lot
of
these
cases,
about
two-thirds
of
these
cases
are
reasonable
charge
cases.
the
hearing
officer
is
the
first
person
actually
to
sit
down
face
to
face
with
the
claimant
and
perhaps
his
physician
and
actually
understand
why
a
particular
charge
was
made.
so,
it
is
not
at
all
peculiar
that
at
this
level
of
review
there
would
frequently
be
a
different--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--a
different...
a
different
decision.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
average
reversal,
as
i
just
said,
was
about
$200.
now,
i
hate
to
get
into
this
whole
medigap
business,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
physician
is
not
always
a
necessary
witness,
and
in
fact
the
record
shows
that
there
is
never
any
problem
in
getting
the
physician
to
show
up
when
he
is
requested
to
show
up.
in
fact,
a
lot
of
these
cases
are
assignment
cases
in
which
it
is
the
physician
that
is
actually
taking
the
appeal,
and
not
the
beneficiary.
now,
if
i
could
just
for
a
minute
talk
about
this
medigap
question
that
the
plaintiffs
raised,
because
once
again
it
raises
the
specter
which
seems
to
pervade
their
entire
presentation
that
there
is
some
sort
of
sinister
force
at
work
here,
while
it
is
true
that
some
medicare
beneficiaries
have
so-called
medigap
coverage,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
they
have
that
coverage,
for
example,
with
the
insurance
company
that
happens
to
be
the
carrier,
the
medicare
carrier
for
that
area.
unless
they
have
the
coverage
with
the
insurance
company
that
was
also
the
medicare
carrier,
even
the
plaintiffs'
argument
on
its
own
terms
doesn't
make
any
sense,
because
that
carrier,
the
insurance
carrier
would
have
no
reason
to
vary
depending
upon
whether
the
claimant
had
medigap
coverage.
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
occidental
life
insurance
company,
which
is
one
of
the
two
carriers
in
the
case,
didn't
even
offer
medigap
coverage.
and
finally,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
hearing
officer,
who
after
all
is
the
person
that
the
plaintiffs
are
claiming
is
biased,
is
ever
told
whether
the
claimant
has
medigap
coverage
or
not.
so
once
again,
we
think
it
is
another
example
of
the
totally
unsubstantiated
speculation
that
pervades
the
plaintiffs'
argument.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
would
raise
a
much
more
difficult
question,
since
due
process
requires,
if
it
requires
anything,
some
sort
of
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
property
is
taken
away,
but
here
there
is
no
question--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
right,
after
having
paid
your
premium
and
submitted
a
claim.
i
think
the
point
is...
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
just
with
this
last
point...
we
don't
think
there
is
any
due
process
problem
in
the
part
b
hearing
appeal
system,
obviously,
but
if
the
court
disagrees,
if
they
think,
for
example,
as
the
plaintiffs
allege,
that
there
is
too
close
a
connection
between
the
carrier
and
the
hearing
officer,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
the
proper
remedy
is
simply
to
ask
the
secretary
to
take
a
closer
look
and
pre-screen
who
are
selected
as
hearing
officers,
and
not
to
judicially
legislate
and
superimpose
an
entire
alj
system
on
top
of
the
part
b
hearing
system.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
get
rid
of
the
bias,
exactly,
if
there
is
in
fact
bias.
thank
you.
