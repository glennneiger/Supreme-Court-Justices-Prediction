mr.
harvey
sohnen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
two
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
due
process
rights
of
medicare
claimants
are
violated
when
the
hearing
officers
who
make
final,
unreviewable
decisions
on
claims
appeals
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
insurance
companies
that
have
denied
the
claims.
the
second
issue
is
one
of
the
remedy,
whether
the
appeal
ordered
by
the
district
court
to
the
secretary
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
counsel
has
made
a
number
of
comments
about
evidence
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
standard
that
this
court
has
recognized
about
the
requirement
of
a
fair
tribunal
is
that
our
system
of
justice
seeks
to
avoid
the
possibility
and
even
the
appearance
of
bias,
and
thus
the
standard
is
one
of
whether
the
circumstances
presented
pose
to
the
average
man
sitting
as
a
judge
a
possible
temptation
not
to
decide
fairly.
it
is
important,
therefore,
that
we
grasp
the
critical
facts
of
this
complex
program
to
understand
why
in
fact
carriers
do
have
a
direct
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
medicare
claims,
and
why
it
is
not
an
extraordinary
exercise
of
the
imagination,
as
counsel
has
stated,
to
so
find.
as
justice
stevens
commented,
there
is
a
very
close
connection
between
policy
decisions
that
are
made
with
respect
to
the
private
carriers'
own
claims
and
to
their
functions
as
medicare
contractors.
in
fact,
whether
they
are
holding
a
medicare
contract
or
administering
their
own
private
plans,
they
have
the
same
dual
mission.
first,
they
are
to
protect
the
funds
of
their
policyholders,
or
in
the
case
of
medicare,
federal
funds,
and
secondly,
they
are
to
honor
the
claims
benefit...
the
claims
decisions...
excuse
me,
the
claims
that
are
submitted
to
them
under
a
prudent
and
cautious
interpretation
of
their
policies.
if
the
carrier
treats
federal
funds
less
cautiously
than
its
own,
its
own
financial
interest
is
jeopardized,
as
the
secretary
has
the
option
not
to
renew
a
carrier's
contract,
which
is
only
for
a
one-year
term,
without
a
showing
of
cause.
thus,
the
statute
mandates
carriers
to
treat
medicare
claims
in
essentially
the
same
manner
as
if
it
were
their
own
money
being
spend.
in
addition,
it
is
important
to
understand
that
there
is
a
very
straightforward
way
in
which
carriers
have
a
direct
financial
stake
in
the
outcome
of
medicare
claims
decisions.
this
is
through
supplemental
private
policies
for
the
elderly,
commonly
known
as
medigap
insurance.
these
supplemental
policies
have
become
more
needed
as
medical
care
costs
have
gone
up
and
as
the
differences
between
actual
costs
of
care
and
medicare
reimbursement
have
increased.
medicare
carriers,
as
counsel
has
indicated,
have
the
name
recognition
that
accompanies
their
names
going
out
on
thousands
of
checks
to
the
beneficiaries.
this
name
recognition
gives
them
a
competitive
advantage
in
obtaining
business
under
the
medigap
programs.
thus,
and
in
fact,
the
secretary's
relationship
with
the
carriers
does
not
deny
the
existence
of
the
medigap
programs,
but
in
fact
in
article
24
of
the
contract,
which
appears
in
the
record,
the
carrier
specifically
authorizes
the...
the
carrier
is
specifically
authorized
to
integrate
its
medicare
and
medigap
claims
processing.
this
leads
to
an
inevitable
financial
stake
for
carriers
in
the
outcome
of
medicare
claims,
since
when
the
carrier
pays
less
on
a
medicare
claim,
the
result
is
that
there
is
less
paid
on
the
medigap
claim.
this
happens
because
medicare
does
not
pay
the
actual
charges
for
covered
services,
but
only
what
a
carrier
determines
to
be
an
allowed
charge.
assuming
a
deductible
when
a
claim
has
been
met,
medicare
pays
80
percent
of
an
allowed
charge,
and
medigap
pays
20
percent.
the
supplemental
plan,
or
medigap
plan,
is
not
liable
for
the
difference
between
the
allowed
charge
and
the
actual
charge,
which
is
ordinarily
picked
up
by
the
beneficiary.
thus,
and
similarly,
when
a
carrier
is
holding
a
medigap
policy
and
the
issue
is
one
of
medical
necessity,
if
there
is
a
determination
that
the
procedure
is
not
medically
necessary
under
medicare,
that
also
means
that
the
medigap
policy
does
not...
does
not
cover
the
claim.
moreover--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
the
way
the
contracts
are
written,
the
medigap
contracts
simply
refer
to
what
medicare
has
decided,
so
that
ordinarily
under
a
private
plan
which
had
no
connection
with
medicare,
there
would
be
the
right
of
review
by
arbitration
or
the
courts,
but
here,
the
medigap
plans
simply
refer
to
the
level
that
is
set
by
medicare.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
that's
right.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
and
this
is...
this
is
the
problem
that
is
at
the
heart
of
this
system,
because
in
their
private
operations,
the
carriers
do
not
have
to
make
the
final
review
of
their
own
claims.
if
they
are
striking...
if
they
make
an
error
in
striking
the
balance
between
the
interests
of
their
stockholders
on
the
one
hand
and
the
interests
of
the
policyholders,
these
questions
are
referred
to
arbitration
and
the
courts
for
independent
review,
yet
under
the
medicare
statute,
there
is
no
independent
review,
and
the
carriers
are
essentially
required
to
police
themselves
in
this
manner,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
have
no
experience
in
conducting
hearings
that
comes
from
the
normal
course
of
their
business
outside
of
medicare.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
your
honor,
there
are
new...
there
are
new
carriers
being
contracted
all
the
time.
there
are
some
carriers
that--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--well,
the...
i
would...
i
would
agree
that
the
experience
of
the
carriers
varies.
however,
they
cannot
draw
on
their
private
business--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--well,
this
is...
this
is
a
nationwide
class
action,
so
this
concerns
all,
all
the
carriers.
blue
shield
of
california,
which
was
a
named
defendant,
has
been
with
the
medicare
program
since
its
inception,
and
i
think
that
the...
the
facts
pertaining
to
blue
shield
show
that
just
having
a
long
experience
with
the
medicare
program
does
not
provide
independent
review.
of
the
seven
hearing
officers
who
work
for
blue
shield,
four
of
them
are
retired
blue
shield
employees,
one
of
them
has
a
current...
a
current
consulting
contract,
and
one
of
them
there
was
no
information
about.
so,
we...
we
think
that
the
facts
of
the
relationships
between
the
hearing
officers
and
the
carriers
presented
an
extreme
picture.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
the
remedy
we
asked
for...
we
presented
one
remedy,
actually,
we...
our
position
was
that
there
were
two
alternative
remedies
that
would
satisfy
constitutional
standards.
the
one
that
the
court
chose,
and
one
that
might
have
been--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--well,
because
it
will
be
de
novo
review.
if--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
our
concern
is
that
anything
short
of
de
novo
review
would
not
provide
protection
from
biased
findings
of
these
hearing
officers.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
the
judgement
specifically
refers
to
a
de
novo
hearing
to
be
provided
by
the
social
security
administration.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
we
take...
we
take
the
position
that
a
fair
hearing
costs
no
more
than
an
unfair
hearing,
because
what
we
are...
what
we
are
questioning
in
this
case
is
not
the
whole
procedures
of
the
medicare
program,
or
even
the
whole
procedures
of
the
appeals
process,
but
simply
the
identity
of
these
hearing
officers
who
cannot
provide
independent
review,
and
the
remedy
that...
one
of
the
remedies
that
we
proposed--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
hearing
officers
in
the
medicare
program
are
not
simply
reviewing
the
decisions
of
other
employees
who
have
clerically
processed
the
claim
at
the
initial
stage.
they
are
reviewing
all
decisions
of
the
carrier,
including
decisions
of
management
as
to
policy
matters,
as
to
claim...
as
to
how
claims
are
handled
generally,
so
this
is
not
a
situation
where
we
simply
have...
we
can
solve
the
problem
by
making
sure
there
has
been
no
personal
involvement.
the
carriers
are
connected
with
the
hearing
officers
by
the
way
that
the
selection,
training,
and
employment
relationship
works,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
the
critical
facts
about
why
independent
review
is
impossible
in
connection
with
the
hearing
officers
and
the...
and
the
carriers.
first
of
all,
the
carriers
have
complete
control
over
the
selection
of
hearing
officers.
the
secretary
does
not
review
the
selection
decisions
for
these
positions,
and
in
fact
its
role
is
limited
to
issuance
of
general
guidelines
which
are
lacking
in
specific
criteria
for
these
positions.
thirdly,
the
carriers
are
free
to
recruit
hearing
officers
in
any
manner
they
please,
such
as
by
word
of
mouth,
with
the
result
that
many
hearing
officers,
such
as
in
the
case
of
blue
shield
of
california,
are
current
or
retired
employees
of
the
insurance
company.
hearing
officers,
as
was
noted,
are
generally
appointed
on
a
hearing
by
hearing
basis,
and
have
no
tenure
whatsoever
in
their
jobs,
or
any
guarantees
that
they
will
be
called
in
for
a
future
hearing.
thus,
the
carriers
can
sever
their
relationships
with
the
hearing
officers
without
stating
cause,
and
it
is
implicit
in
this
relationship
that
hearing
officers
have
no
real
protection
against
retaliation.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
it
is
our
position
that
we
don't...
we
don't
identify
actual
bias
in
the
record.
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
in
our
position,
the
standard
of
this
court
is
whether
there
is
a
possible
temptation
for...
for
biased
decision-making.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
first
of
all,
i...
i
want
to
focus
that
the
constitutional
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
not
whether
a
lawyer
has
to
be
the
final
decision-maker
in
a
case,
but
it
is
whether
independent
review
is
necessary,
and
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
were
erroneous
decisions
that
were
not
being
corrected.
in
one
of
the
annual
contractor
reviews
that
appeared
in
the
record,
there
were
notations
indicating
that
the
secretary
was
finding
a
higher
degree
of
mistakes
than
the
carrier
was
in
its
own
reviews.
and
i
think
that
given
the
complexity
of
the
medicare
program,
and
the
wide
range
of
issues,
the
fact
that
there
were
no
selection
criteria
in
any
meaningful
sense
except
for
what
the
carriers
wanted,
i
think
it
must
be
assumed
that
some...
some
review
by
a
body
which
has
some
knowledge
of
the
law
would
decrease
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
no,
there
was...
there
was...
the
evidence
in
the
record
showed...
some
of
which
has
been
included
in
our
joint
appendix,
showed
an
extremely
high
error
rate
of
processing
claims
in
the
medicare
program.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
there
was...
there
was
that
evidence,
but
there
was
also
evidence
indicating
that
the
secretary's
own
staff
viewed
those
statistics
as
being
distorted.
there
was
evidence
that
these
statistics
fluctuated
according
to
technical
variations
in
the
carriers'
policy
as
to
when
they
conducted
a...
when
they
resolved
matters
at
the
review
stage
as
opposed
to
the
hearing
stage.
more
importantly,
these
statistics
mix
corrections
of
computer
type
errors,
which
abound,
with
substantive
decisions
where
the
carrier's
policy
was
at
stake.
and
finally,
any
modification
whatsoever
in
the
amount
of
the
claim,
whether
for
50
cents
or
some
other
small
amount,
would
be
counted
as
a
reversal
under
the
way
the
statistics
were
kept.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
we
think
that
the...
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
a
right
of
independent
review,
and
the
relationships
that
prevent
an
independent
review
are
undisputed,
and
appear
in
the
face
of
the
statute
essentially
as
i
have
described.
the
training,
the
selection,
lack
of
job
security,
lack
of
review,
all
those
factors
were
undisputed
in
the
factual
record.
there
may
have
been
certain
facts
that
were
subject
to
different
interpretations,
but--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--but
in
terms
of
the...
yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
no,
they
will
not
be,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
justice
white's
question
before,
something
short
of
de
novo
review
does
not
cure
the
problem
of
biased
decision-making.
the
court
of
claims
has
indicated
that
if
its...
as
it
sees
its
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act,
it
would
be
for
a
review
of
an
extremely
narrow
scope.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
even
narrower
than
that.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
i
believe
that
it
would
be...
it
would
be
limited
to
questions
of
constitutionality
and
questions
of
statutory
interpretation.
thus,
erroneous
findings
of
fact
and
applications
of
the
law
to
the
facts
would
not
be
reviewable,
and
these
are
so
many
of
the
cases
that
we
have
before
us.
for
example,
mr.
mcclure's
case
involved...
mr.
mcclure
was
a
resident
of
a
remote
community
in
northern
california.
he
suffered
a
heart
attack.
his
physician
in
that
community
felt
that
immediate
surgical
intervention
was
necessary
to
save
his
life.
he
therefore
concluded
that
a
facility
in
san
francisco
was
the
nearest
appropriate
place
for
him...
for
him
to
be
treated,
and
he
went...
he
was
sent
to
san
francisco.
his
life
was
saved.
but
when
he
submitted
his
claim
for
an
air
ambulance
under
medicare,
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
indicating
that
his
doctor's
physician...
his
physician's
testimony...
his
physician's
opinion
was
incorrect,
the
medicare
hearing
officer
decided
that
there
was
a
closer
appropriate
facility.
now,
that
is
the
type
of
case
that
would
never
be
reviewable
in
the
court
of
claims
under
the
jurisdiction
that
they
have
asserted.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
i
think
that...
i
think
the
gravest
concern
about
this
system
is
the
fact
that
no
independent
review
is
available,
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
i
think
i
can
respond
to
your
question
with
a
follow-up
to
that,
which
is
that
the
fact
that
the
competence
of
these
hearing
officers
is
determined
as
part
of
this
close
relationship
between
the
hearing
officer...
between
the
carrier
and
the
hearing
officers
aggravates
the
fact
that
there
is
a
concern
about
bias.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
the
question
that
poses
is
what
would
be
necessary
to
ensure
independent
review.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
i
think
that
the...
if
a
system
as
you
have
described
assured
that
a
hearing
officer
was
insulated
from
the
carrier
whose
decision
he
was
reviewing,
both
in
terms
of
the
selection
process,
which
now
leaves--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--there
is
an
extremely
close
connection,
and
the
job
security
aspects--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
and
with...
with
some
input
from
the
secretary
about
qualifications,
i...
i
think
that
that
would
be
of
the
nature
of
independent
review.
it
is
hard
to
assess
such
a
plan
without
facts,
but
i
think
the
essence
of
independent
review
turns
on
the--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes,
if...
if
the...
if
the
individual
policies
of
carriers
was...
did
not
affect
the
ability
of
the
hearing
officers
to
make
decisions,
that
would
be
the
type
of
remedy
that
would
reduce
the
risk
of
bias.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
we
also...
the
other
issue--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
may
it
please
the
court,
in
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question
prior
to
the
break,
what
this
case
poses
is
not
simply
the
issue
of
the
possibility
of
bias,
but
the
extent
of
the
constitutional
requirement
for
a
competent
and
independent
review
of
medicare
claims
to
protect
the
integrity
of
that
program,
and
for
that
reason
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
my
answer
to
justice
white's
hypothetical.
if
carriers
are
given
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
making
decisions
on
medicare
claims,
we
still
have
the
problem
of
the
interweaving
financial
interests
between
the
carrier's
own
policies
and
the
medicare
program,
and
in
addition,
any...
any
new
program
of
that
nature
would
certainly
involve
costs
that
are...
that
are
not
currently
involved.
in
our...
it
is
our
position
that
a
fair
hearing
in
the
first
instance
is
possible
in
the
medicare
program
at
no
extra
cost.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
cost
of
administrative
law
judge
hearings
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
cost
of
these
hearings
conducted
by
insurance
company
appointees
that
we
have
been
challenging.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
the
record
indicates
that
the...
the
average
is
approximately
$600.
about
two
years
ago
is
the
latest
statistic.
of
course,
these...
the
amounts
range
from
the
minimum
of
$100
to
the
costs
of
major
surgery.
so,
it
would
be
our
position
that
rather
than
creating
a
new
structure
that
is
still
in
the
hands
of
the
carriers,
the
fairest,
most
economical
method
would
be
simply
to
replace
the
current
system
with--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--that's
true.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
the--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
we
are
not
objecting
to
the
expertise
of
the
private
sector
in
processing
these
claims--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
we...
we
do...
we
do
feel
that
there
is
a
financial
interest,
as
we
have
stated,
that
prevents
fair
decision-making.
the
issue
here
is
not--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
requires
that
people
have
to
demand
a
hearing.
if
they
are
not
asking
for
a
hearing,
perhaps
the
matter
has
been
resolved
satisfactorily.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
about
26,000.
so
the
issue
in
this
case
is
much
narrower
than
the...
than
the
congressional
judgment--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
i
think
that
we
have
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
choice
of
congress
to...
to
place
the
administration
of
a
massive
system
of
this
nature
in
the
hands
of
the
private
sector
and
this
very
original
characteristic
of
this
program
whereby
the
final
decisions
are
also
placed
in
the
private
sector,
and
it
was
this
originality
that
i
believe
justice
brennan
referred
to--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes,
and--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--i
think
that
there
is...
in
our...
in
the
history
of
governmental
operations,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
experience
with
using
the
competence
of
the
private
sector.
what
distinguishes
this
case
is
that
the
final
say
is
in
the
private
sector.
this
is
what
is
so
distinctive
about
the
case,
and
in
fact,
it
is
not
just
the
district
court
that
has
noted
this,
but
also
the
national
commission
on
social
security
reviewing
this
act,
as
it
is
charged
to
do
by
congress,
the
american
bar
association,
in
its
amicus
brief--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--yes.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
that
issue
isn't
presented
in
this
case,
because
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
appeal.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
well,
the
statute
does
say,
a
fair
hearing,
and
we
would--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--well,
in
fact,
i
think--
mr.
harvey
sohnen
--i
think
that
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
there
are
many
reasons
why
people
don't
appeal.
in
fact,
a
study
was
done
of
beneficiary
appeals
which
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
which
indicates
that
the
low
appeal
rate
reflects
the
age
and
infirmity
of
the
medicare
claimant.
so,
i
think
that...
and
also
the
dollar
amounts
that
were
involved.
mr.
harvey
sohnen
i
think
that
in
any
system
there
is
a
mix
of
different
kinds
of
cases,
different...
and
different
concerns.
the
medicare
system
is
distinguished
by
the
wide
range
of
issues
that
are
covered,
and
so...
and
it
also...
and
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
27
million
individuals
in
this
system
are
elderly
for
the
most
part,
or
disabled,
and
that
the
kinds
of
claims
in
their
very
nature
often
don't
lead
to
extensive
litigation.
as
i
was
indicating
before
in
my
response
pertaining
to
the
erika
decision
and
the
idea
of
review
in
the
court
of
claims,
there
are
certain...
there
are
some
kinds
of
cases
that
simply
don't
generate
massive
litigation,
but
to...
but
to
draw
the
inference
that
a
system
is
completely
fair
because...
because
it
is
not
used
is,
i
think,
a
not
completely
wise
position.
i
think,
if
i
could
continue
with
the...
the
statement...
my
concerns
about
the
originality
of
this
system,
the
experience
of
our
system
with
private
boards,
private
operations
of
this
kind
has
always
allowed
a
wide
scope
of
review.
the
medicare
system,
which
allows
no
review
from
the
insurance
companies,
is
to
be
contrasted
with
private
occupational
licensing
boards,
where
there
is
extensive
judicial
review.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
gibson
versus
berryhill,
which
was
the
alabama
optometry
board,
that
is
a
case
in
which
there
were
bias
concerns
about
the
tribunal,
and
the
tribunal
was
struck
down
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
extensive
judicial
review.
so,
in
a
system,
as
here,
where
we
have
given
the
carriers
not
only
the
first
say,
but
the
last
say
in
deciding
claims,
grave
constitutional
problems
arise.
thank
you.
