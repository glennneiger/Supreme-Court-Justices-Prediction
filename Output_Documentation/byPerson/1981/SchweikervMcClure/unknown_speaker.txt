unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
does
either
the
hearing
officer
or
the
carrier
have
any
financial
or
pecuniary
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
determination
by
the
hearing
officer?
unknown
speaker
you
used
the
term
"salary".
are
these
people
salaried?
unknown
speaker
so
their
only
interest...
your
opponent
argues
that
they
have
an
interest
in
getting
re-employed
over
and
over
again.
they
are
not
permanently...
they
don't
have
any
kind
of
tenure.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
geller,
what
is
the
source
of
their
compensation?
is
it
the
carrier
or
the
government?
unknown
speaker
and
the--
unknown
speaker
--by
the
government.
unknown
speaker
does
that
run
into
considerable...
does
that
run
into
much
money?
unknown
speaker
are
there
other
expenses
in
addition
to
the
compensation
to
the
hearing
officers?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
for
this
procedure.
i
mean,
does
the
carrier
get
compensated,
for
example,
for--
unknown
speaker
--the
rent
of
hearing
rooms
and
things
like
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
if
a
person
has
the
job
of
being
a
hearing
examiner
in
one
of
these,
what
body
of
law
does
he
look
to
to
decide
reasonableness?
is
there
a
body
in
the
private
sector
of
interpreting
the
same
contractual
provisions
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
do
they
take
into
account
the
same
kind
of
things
they
would
take
into
account
if
it
were
simply
a
private--
unknown
speaker
--well,
then,
doesn't
the
carrier
have
an
interest
because
of
its
possible
impact
on
its
private
operations
in
how
certain
contractual
provisions
are
construed,
or
how
certain
reasonable
determinations
are
made?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
wouldn't
it
be
interested
in
having
precedents
establish
the
fair
and
reasonableness
of
the
ceilings
it
has
used
in
its
private
business?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
geller,
are
there
any
other
models
of
this
type
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
this...
letting
this
sort
of
thing
be
done
by
private
judges?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
so
in
that
sense,
this
is
an
original,
isn't
it,
this
kind
of
procedure?
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
is
it
significant
that
you
have
two
problems
here?
one
is
the
carriers
appointing
the
hearing
officers,
and
secondly,
no
right
of
review
thereafter,
judicial
review
or
other
type
review.
is
that
significant,
that
you
have
both
alleged
problems?
unknown
speaker
but
do
we
have
to
look
at
that
and
focus
on
that
in
weighing
the
validity
of
this--
unknown
speaker
--why
do
they
do
it,
mr.
geller?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
possible...
i
don't
know
if
this
is
true
or
not...
to
infer
that
they
may
want
to
be
sure
that
the
decisions
are
consistent
with
the
way
their
private
business
operates,
that
they
do
have
an
interest
in
consistency,
not
in
outcome
in
any
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
that
they
always
treat
claims
for...
we
have
dialysis
in
the
next
case.
they
want
those
always
resolved
according
to
the
same
standards.
unknown
speaker
but
which
in
turn
refer
back
to
the
ones
they
use
themselves,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
most
of
these
questions
reasonable
charge
questions?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
they
would
have
to
grant
non-meritorious
claims
in
their
private
business,
too,
to
be
consistent.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
record
reveal
that
is
a
pretty
cursory
review,
mr.
geller?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
this
went
out
for
summary
judgment
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
you
are
entitled
to
summary
judgment--
unknown
speaker
--or
do
you
merely
want
it
to
go
back
for--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
the
mind
of
the
district
court,
would
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
secretary
cure
the
entire
problem?
unknown
speaker
that
would
cure
all
the
possible
bias
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
even
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
didn't
suggest
that
if
there
were
some
review
by
the
secretary,
then
the
secretary's
review
in
turn
was
subject
to
judicial
review,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sohnen--
unknown
speaker
--the
other
side
of
that
coin,
i
suppose,
is
that
the
individual
has
a
remedy
in
court
for
the
20
percent
claim,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
by
its
terms,
it
is
measured
by
what
is
allowed
as
reasonable
under
medicare?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
had...
how
many
years
of
it
have
they
had
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
an
old
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
this
one?
unknown
speaker
what
remedy
did
you
ask
for
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
why
is
review
by
the
secretary
going
to
cure
the
bias?
i
mean,
this...
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
a
new
hearing?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what...
is
that
what
the
district
court,
you
think,
granted
you?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
consideration
given
to
the
added
cost
that
the
district
court's
judgment
would
impose
on
this
structure?
unknown
speaker
but
in
goldberg
against
kelly--
unknown
speaker
--the
court
said,
some
ten
or
twelve
years
ago,
that
just
so
another
person
was
having
a
look
at
it
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
due
process.
unknown
speaker
counsel--
unknown
speaker
--was
there
any
evidence,
though,
that
there
was
actual
bias
involved
on
the
part
of
the
hearing
officers?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
it?
your
answer
is
no?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
explain
why
an
administrative
law
judge
employed
by
the
secretary
would
make
fewer
presumably
erroneous
decisions
than
the
hearing
officers?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
that,
or
the
district
court
decided
it
on
the
basis
of
assumptions
rather
than
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
showed,
did
it
not,
that
perhaps
the
hearing
officers
were
granting
as
many
as
50
percent
of
the
claims
that
came
before
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sohnen?
unknown
speaker
in
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
as
though
you
had
prevailed
after
trial
and
gotten
a
judgment
or
a
verdict
below,
and
simply
saying
there
is
evidence
to
support
the
verdict,
but
as
i
understand,
it
went
off
on
summary
judgment,
so
that
any
point
of
disputed
evidence
would
be
resolved
against
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sohnen,
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
next
case--
unknown
speaker
--concerning
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction,
if
this
court
should
rule
there
that
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims,
are
your
concerns
alleviated?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
on
the
record.
unknown
speaker
oh,
really?
unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
sort
out
to
what
extent
you
are
claiming
bias
taints
this
result,
or
whether
it
is
just
general
incompetence,
just
the
general
chance
of
arriving
at
unsound
conclusions.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
all
the
insurance
carriers
involved
in
this
program
together
created
a
pool
of
hearing
officers
who
didn't
work
for
any
of
them
and
never
had,
gave
them
some...
the
same
amount
of
training
that
they
have
gotten
now,
and
drew
them
by
lot,
would
you
be
here
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
independent
review
be
required
in
that...
on
those
facts?
if
it
is,
it
must
be
your
objection
is
basically
that
this
is
just
an
unsound
way
of
deciding
cases.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
was.
unknown
speaker
that
would
eliminate
a
good
deal
of
the
so-called
bias.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sohnen,
what
are
you
arguing
other
than
the
possibility
of
bias?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sohnen--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interrupt
with
a
question
on
cost?
does
the
record
tell
us
how
big...
what
the
dollar
amount
involved
in
the
typical
claim
is
of
this
type?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
right,
if
you
are
right,
why,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
really
ought
to
move
all
of
the
processing
out
of
the
private
hands,
because
an
awful
lot
of
people
don't
request
hearings,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
the
great
bulk
of
them.
unknown
speaker
and
you
must...
you
must...
if
hearing
officers
are
biased,
i
would
think
the...
the
prehearing
officer
processing
is
even
more
biased.
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
why
would--
unknown
speaker
--why
should
people
sit
still
for
that?
unknown
speaker
or
their
non-bias?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
with
respect
to...
i
would
think
you
would
say
with
respect
to
people
who
don't
request
hearings,
too.
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
remember
that
you
said
there
were
158
million
claims
a
year?
unknown
speaker
so
then
how
many
of
them
go
to
hearing?
unknown
speaker
how
about
all
those
other
people?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would
think
they
had
been
treated
even
worse,
the
ones
who
accept
their...
the
way
the
claim
is
disposed
of
by
the
carrier.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
people
with
an
average
claim
of
$600
who
think
they
are
being
jobbed
but
who
can't
possibly
afford
to
contest
it.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
urge...
the
whole
thing
ought
to
go
under
the
government,
shouldn't
it?
if
you
are
making
really
any
sense?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sohnen--
unknown
speaker
--you
would
take
the
same
position,
i
take
it,
if
there
were
no
appeal
procedure
at
all.
you
would
say
that
would
be
equally
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
have
the
carrier
take
a
second
look
at
the
problem.
i
mean,
it
is
not
like...
there
is
no
statutory
right
to
appeal
to
an
independent...
to
an
independent
decision-maker,
though.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
congress
knew
exactly
what
it
meant
by
a
fair
hearing.
it
is
the
fair
hearing
prescribed
by
statute.
and
could
it
not
be
reasonably
said
that
out
of
the
158
million
claims,
157,900
of
them
apparently
were
satisfied
with
the
result.
unknown
speaker
at
least
that
is
arguable,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
unreasonable...
is
it
unreasonable
to...
for
someone
to
argue
that
this
suggests
that
this
practical
solution
is
working
out
pretty
well,
as
congress
anticipated
that
it
would
and
said
that
it
should?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
does
the
record
tell
us
how
much
these
hearings
cost,
how
much
they
pay
the
hearing
examiners?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
danger
that
the
hearing
examiners
might
have
a
policy
that
it
might
be
cheaper
to
pay
them
$200
than
to
go
ahead
with
the
hearings,
save
everybody
money--
unknown
speaker
they
might
shorten
a
lot
of
hearings
by
spending
two
or
three
days
arguing
about
something?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
rather
strange,
it's
a
50
percent
reversal
rate,
that's
a
very
strange--
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
mean,
say
reverse...
you
mean
reversal,
or
you
mean
just
there
is
a
different
decision?
unknown
speaker
it
might
have
increased
it
by
$10.
unknown
speaker
it
also
occurs
to
me,
if
the
physician
is
normally
a
necessary
witness
at
these
hearings,
as
to
the
reasonableness
issue,
that
probably
explains
why
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
cases
that
are
not
appealed,
because
doctors
do
not
come
that
inexpensively.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
if
the
act
didn't
provide
for
any
so-called
fair
hearing
at
all,
what
would
be
the
basis
for...
what
would
be
the...
would
you
think
there
would
be
a
reasonable
attack
on
it
on
due
process?
unknown
speaker
and
the
property
is
the...
is
the
reasonable
anticipation
of
getting
reimbursed,
according
to
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
just
try
to
get
rid
of
the
bias.
