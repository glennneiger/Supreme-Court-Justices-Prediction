unknown
speaker
mr.
hoge,
i
see
the
statute
says...
as
to
what
you
describe
as
the
second
method
of
service...
that
the
process
server
may
explain
and
leave
a
copy
of
the
notice.
have
the
kentucky
courts
construed
the
phrase
"may
explain"?
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
something
about
it
being
placed
under
the
door,
also?
unknown
speaker
then
it
isn't
precisely
the
same.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoge,
i
take
it
there
was
evidence
which
was
not
contradicted
at
the
trial
or
in
the
court
to
the
effect
that
the
posted
notices
are
sometimes
removed.
and
was
there
any
evidence
produced
as
to
the
frequency
with
which
mailed
notices
might
be
lost
or
not
delivered?
was
there
any
evidence
about
that?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
evidence,
mr.
hoge,
the
thing
went
off
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
was
it
evidence
in
the
sense
of
what,
depositions,
or?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
bound
by
it,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
he
was
bound
by
it,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
kentucky's
practice
to
also
mail
a
notice,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
result
of
case
is
that
both
things
have
to
be
done?
unknown
speaker
posting
and
mailing?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold?
unknown
speaker
yes.
to
require
what?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
it
would
violate
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
if
the
plaintiff
just
mailed
rather
than
posted?
unknown
speaker
and
so
do
you
think
the
net
result
is
that
he'd
have
to
do
both?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoge,
what
is
the
position
of
the
kentucky
attorney
general
about
the
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
no
formal
appearance
by
the
ag
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
court
has
no
power
anymore
than
the
sixth
circuit
did,
to
say
that
mailing
will
be
enough.
all
it
could
say
is
that
mailing
is
or
is
not
required
under
the
constitution.
if
kentucky
wants
to
say
that...
you
may
insist
on
mailing,
but
we're
going
to
insist
on
posting,
then
you'd
have
to
do
both.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
suppose
the
court,
like
the
sixth
circuit,
could
reach
different
conclusions
about
the
validity
of
the
statute
as
applied
in
different
states
or
in
different
areas
of
the
same
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
posting
isn't
sufficient
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
statute,
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
only
posting,
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,...
what
if
you
looked
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
representing
its
judgment
about
how
posting
operates
in
the
particular
environment
that
is
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
it
might
come
to
a
wholly
different
conclusion
somewhere
else.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoge,
there
are
comments
in
the
briefs
about
the
inability
under
kentucky
procedure
to
counterclaim
for
lack
of
habitability.
unknown
speaker
until
a
detainer
action
is
instituted.
is
this
really
true?
unknown
speaker
and
is
this
reason
for
a
tenant
not
to
pay
his
rent?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
tenant
claims
the
place
has
become
uninhabitable,
it's
overrun
with
rats
and
all
kinds
of
things,
and
i
suspect
that
this
is
not
untrue
with
some
of
these
places.
is
this
a
reason
for
him
not
to
pay
his
rent
until
he
can
get
his
habitability
claim
presented
in
court,
as
a
counterclaim?
unknown
speaker
what
claim
does
he
have
under
kentucky
procedure?
unknown
speaker
what
claim
for
lack
of
habitability
does
he
have
under
kentucky
procedure?
can
he
sue
his
landlord?
unknown
speaker
there
are
comments
in
the
brief
that
he
may
not
until
a
detainer
action
has
been
instituted.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
provision
for
paying
it
into
the
clerk
of
court
or
into
some
neutral
body?
unknown
speaker
under
kentucky
law,
can
the
landlord
not
collect
backdue
rent
as
part
of
the
forcible
detainer
action?
unknown
speaker
why
if
he's
suing
for
back
rent
would...
why
wouldn't
posting
be
due
process?
i
take
it
you
just
indicated
that
personal
service
would
be
required.
as
a
constitutional
matter?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
under
kentucky
law
you
would
have
to
give
him
personal
service.
unknown
speaker
how
about
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
you
could
still...
in
a
back
rent
action
you
could
proceed
by
posting.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
gives
the
tenant
some
idea
that
the
landlord
is
about
to
do
something,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
the
landlord
was
in
some
jurisdiction
that
didn't...
some
part
of
kentucky
that
didn't
require
the
sending
of
a
letter?
unknown
speaker
so
then,
so
far
as
construing
the
statute
on
its
face
is
concerned,
we
should
construe
it
in
connection
with
the
requirement
of
the
uniform
act?
unknown
speaker
the
only
question
here
is
whether
for
an
eviction,
the
posting
is
sufficient
under
the
constitution,
and
that
is
the
only
question
before
the
court,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
this
got
a
whole
lot
to
do
with
the
issue
we
have
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
are
you
wasting
your
time
on
it
for?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
mr.
hoge
that
kentucky
law
would
require
personal
service
if
the
landlord
were
to
require
or
request
back
rent?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
the
washington
experience
is
any
part
of
the
record
before
this
court.
i
don't
think
amicus
are
entitled
to
augment
the
record.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
i
don't
think
it...
so
far
as
augmenting
the
record,
it's
really
properly
before
the
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
did
the
sixth
circuit
find
that?
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
sixth
circuit
find
that?
i
can
see
the
language
where
it
says
the
summonses
are
not
infrequently
removed...
i
didn't
find
the
50
%
figure
in
their
opinion.
well,
if
you
say
it's
there
i'll
go
back
and
take
another
look
at
it.
don't
interrupt
your--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
isn't
the
same
thing
as
saying
50
%
of
the
services
by
summons
don't
reach
the--
unknown
speaker
is
this
in
the
record,
what
you're
telling
us
now?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
it's
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
mere
fact
that
a
judgment
is
taken
by
default
doesn't
mean
that
the
process
didn't
reach
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
no
tenant
ever
defaults
in
an
unlawful
detainer
action?
unknown
speaker
can
i
assume
that
there
might
be
some
people
who
aren't
interested
in
litigating?
unknown
speaker
there
must...
i
know
you
as
a
lawyer
don't
want
to
believe
it,
but
there
must
be
some.
one
or
two.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
some
of
these
people
might
not
have
wanted
to
litigated,
so
they
defaulted.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
must
be
some.
aren't
there
some
innocent
people
in
this
world?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
a
good
idea
for
us
to
let
the
people
default
if
they
want
to
default.
unknown
speaker
because
you
remember
the
thirteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
no
more
slavery.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
is
it
your
position
that
the
constitutional
requirement
might
be
different
depending
upon
what
part
of
the
state
the
action
occurs?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
in
multiple
housing
units,
the
notice
is
more
likely
to
be
taken
away
than
out
in
the
country
where
it's
a
single
family
dwelling?
is
that
what
you're
driving
at?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
notice
by
first
class
mail
is
constitutionally
adequate,
counsel?
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
going
to
follow
it
up
with
a
question
about
whether
you
think
that
mailboxes
are
as
vulnerable
as
front
doors
to
vandalism.
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
violation
of
kentucky
law
to
remove
one
of
the
posted
notices
from
the
door?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
statute
requires
personal
service
if
they
can
get
it.
unknown
speaker
and
it
requires
leaving
it
with
a
member
of
the
family
if
you
can
find
one.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
question
is
whether,
when
you
can't
do
either
one
of
them,
whether
posting
is
good
enough.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
statute
requires
posting
if
they
can't...
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way.
if
you
can't
personally
serve
and
if
you
can't
find
a
member
of
the
family,
would
it
satisfy
the
kentucky
law
if
you
mailed
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
sure
of
your
answer
on
kentucky
law?
i
gathered
your
opponent
took
a
somewhat
different
position.
i
mean,
if
kentucky
says
by
statute
that
this
is
the
way
you
serve
an
unlawful
detainer
action,
do
you
think
that
one
can
simply
substitute
a
form
of
service
that
isn't
prescribed
in
the
statute
for
one
that
is?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
mean
it
would
satisfy
kentucky
law.
well,
the
kentucky
law
says
that
if
you
can't
find
them,
service
may
be
by
postal.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
shall
be;
it
says
may
be.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
where
are
your
named
plaintiffs
now?
are
they
still
in
the
housing?
unknown
speaker
is
there
still
a
controversy?
unknown
speaker
if
the
statute
required
that
the
service
be
made
by
slipping
it
under
the
door,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i'm
asking.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
in
contrast
to
publication
in
the
newspaper
in
mullane,
where
there
was
just
no
bones
about
it.
the
people
would
never
read
it.
here
you've
got
an
argued
percentage
that
perhaps
don't
receive
it,
but
it
certainly
isn't
the
same
thing
as
publication
in
a
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
well,
mullane
said,
too,
we
think
that
under
such
circumstances,
reasonable
risk
that
notice
might
not
actually
reach
every
beneficiary
are
justifiable.
now
and
then
an
extraordinary
case
may
turn
up,
but
constitutional,
like
other
mortal
contrivances,
has
to
take
some
chances.
and
in
the
great
majority
of
instances,
no
doubt
justice
will
be
done.
