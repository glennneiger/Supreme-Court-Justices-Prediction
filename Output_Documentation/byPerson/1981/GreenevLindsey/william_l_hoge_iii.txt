mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
single
issue
presented
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
kentucky
conspicuous
posting
of
notice
in
landlord
and
tenants
cases.
an
alternative
statement
of
the
problem
addressed
is
whether
or
not
alternative
constructive
posting
service
continues
to
be
satisfactory
notice
under
the
due
process
clause,
unless
shored
up
with
additional
mailing.
the
facts
of
this
case
should
be
addressed
in
two
parts.
number
one,
what
in
fact
is
the
landlord
and
tenant
or
forcible
eviction
procedure
in
kentucky;
and
number
two,
as
concerns
the
specific
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
i
would
point
out
that
i
believe
the
facts
of
the
case
speak
very
strongly
about
notice
in
the
legislative
scheme
that
is
set
up.
first,
the
landlord
must
notify
the
tenant
in
writing
that
the
tenant
is
in
breach
of
the
lease
for
failure
to
make
his
rent
payments.
that
writing
is
by
registered
or
certified
mail.
the
tenant
is
on
notice.
the
second
fact
of
the
legislative
scheme
is
that
the
written
notice
is
defined
under
the
statutes
quite
clearly,
and
only
after
that
notice
is
sent
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
bringing
of
a
writ
of
forcible
entry
are
you
allowed
to
seek
such
an
instrument,
and
in
fact,
the
forcible
writ
cannot
be
sought
until
seven
days
after
this
notice
is
sent.
you
then
file
in
our
lower
court
for
a
forcible
writ.
this
writ
is
subsequently
served
under
the
statute,
which
is
the
issue
of
this
case,
454.030.
it
is
served
one
of
three
ways.
it's
served
by
actually
serving
the
tenant,
if
you
can
find
the
tenant.
secondly,
by
leaving
a
copy
of
it
with
a
16-year
old
or
better
who
would
understand
the
action.
and
only
thirdly
by
mailing,
as
we
call
it,
only
thirdly
by
posting
the
writ
of
eviction.
next,--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--no,
sir,
i
do
not
believe
they
have
construed
that.
nor,
in
fact,
is
this...
has
that
particular
section
ever
been
tested
at
all,
to
my
understanding.
after
it
is
posted,
should
that
be
the
method...
and,
of
course,
that
would
be
the
only
issue
that
would
concern
this
court
today...
then
another
period
of
time,
seven
days,
at
least
three
days,
must
expire.
however,
the
record
speaks
clearly
in
this
matter
that
there
is
at
least
two
weeks
or
so
after
that
finding
before
another
writ,
the
writ
of
possession,
is
issued,
and
then
another
period
of
three
days
goes
by
prior
to
any
literal
set-out.
now,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
complaint
tell
the
court
a
great
deal
about
the
truth
of
service
by
posting
in
this
case.
number
one,
all
three
plaintiffs
did
not
pay
their
rent.
there
is
no
tenant
in
this
case
whatsoever
that
alleges
that
they
paid
their
rent.
nor
was
the
class
so
defined.
nor,
in
fact,
can
i
conceive
of
any
of
the
statistics
which
have
been
thrown
in
this
case
subsequently
showing
that
any
of
the
tenants,
in
fact,
paid
the
rent.
second,
and
which
i
purport
is
very
strong
evidence,
notice
that
the
landlord
may
well
be
subsequently
upset.
next,
i
will
point
out
each
and
every
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
at
least
two
months
in
arrears.
not
only
had
they
not
paid
the
rent
once
and
there
was
some
mistake
about
the
matter;
they
had
withheld
their
rent.
next,
all
three
plaintiffs
alleged...
and
that's
the
extent
of
the
proof
in
the
matter,
by
the
way,...
that
they
did
not
receive
the
writ
of
the
forcible
detainer.
but
the
most
important
fact,
i
believe,
in
the
entire
case
is
that
all
three
plaintiffs
got
the
writ
of
possession,
the
second
writ,
by
precisely
the
same
means,
by
the
posting
statute,
by
the
exact
same
service
method,
and
all
three
admit
that
in
their
complaint.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
in
the
complaint
it
states
that
it
was
found
inside
on
the
floor,
and
that
it
had
apparently
been
stuck
through
the
mail
slot
in
the
door.
all
three
allege
it
was
found
in
their
apartment
on
the
floor,
and
apparently
put
through
the
mail
slot.
there
is
a
case
in
kentucky
on
that--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--well,
yes,
sir.
possibly
not.
it
is
not
the
same
in
that
we
have
no
idea
whether
or
not
they
got
the
original
writ
forcible.
we
only
have
an
idea
of
whether
or
not
they
did
get
the
second
one...
other
than
their
allegation
that
they
did
not
receive
it.
now,
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
the
way
the
sheriffs
practice
the
posting
of
the
notice
is
an
entirely
different
issue,
and
i
don't
believe
has
been
addressed
at
all
in
this
case,
number
one.
and
number
two,
might
well
have
represented
some
type
of
complaint
by
some
type
of
person
that
might
have
been
in
this
class,
but
we
don't
have
any
record
whatsoever
on
that
kind
of
thing
happening.
there
is
one
case
in
kentucky
and
unfortunately,
i'm
reticent
to
cite
it
because
i
don't
have
the
cite
with
me.
it's
right
under
the
forcible
statute
today,
that
says
that
placing
of
the
notice
was
posting
by
placing
it
in
the
grill
of
the
door.
and
a
number
of
people
did
testify
in
their
depositions
that
oftentimes
they
did
stick
it
through
the
hole.
they
considered
posting
all
the
way
more
effective.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
i
think
that's
an
excellent
question
in
that
it
directs
itself
to
the
evidence
that
was
presented.
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
presented
by
six
deputy
sheriffs.
that's
the
total
extent
of
the
sworn
evidence.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
yes,
sir,
one
deposition
taken
in
my
office
where
the
six
deputy
sheriffs,
all
of
whom
are
politically
appointed,
gave
their
best
opinion
on
what
transpired
and
what
they
thought
happened
in
forcible
cases.
most
of
the
time,
they
were
confused
about
whether
or
not
it
was
a
forcible
or
a
writ
of
possession,
whether
or
not
they
were
setting
a
person
out
or
whether
they
were
serving
the
original
eviction
notice.
and
they
were
quite
apprehensive
about
what
happened
to
them
in
attempting
to
serve
writs
for
setouts,
writs
for
possession.
yes,
in
that
situation
they
were
most
upset.
now,
i
won't
mislead
the
court.
there
is
testimony
in
here
in
the
joint
appendix,
that
a
number
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
testified
that
they
had
seen
on
a
very
few
occasions
where
a
writ
had
been
taken
down
by
another
tenant
in
the
same
building.
but
that
was,
in
fact,
the
extent
of
the
evidence.
and
the
matter
went
to
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
in
that
the
sixth
circuit
case
was,
on
all
fours
beyond
a
question,
the
weber
case
was
right
on
point.
the
district
court
judge
addressed
the
weber
decision,
found
it
be
constitutional,
stated
that
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
additional
mailing--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--pardon
me?
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
yes,
sir.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
comments
on
that.
and
he
comments
on
that
but
he
says
it's
a
salutary
rule
that
he
was
bound
by,
and
points
outs
that
the
weber
decision
had
been
the
law
for
some
70
years.
and
quite
frankly,
it
appears
pretty
clear
that
he
felt
it
was
unfortunate
that
mailing
could
not
be
mandated
by
a
federal
court
as
an
additional
due
process
safeguard
in
this
particular
case,
but
could
not
be
mandated
by
a
federal
court
since
due
process
does
not
require
a
state
to
adopt
the
optimum
method
of
service,
but
only
a
minimum
standard
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
no,
ma'am.
that
is
precisely
what
the
issue
is
here
today.
now,
this
particular
ultra-law,
landlord
and
tenants
law,
applies
only
to
the
three
major
metropolitan
areas
this
time.
in
the
rural
area,
there's
never
any
question
whatsoever
where
mr.
jones
might
live,
down
the
road,
and
they
know
where
his
farmhouse
is.
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
concerned
a
housing
authority
in
a
multiple
multiple-unit
dwelling,
and
was
only
brought
on
behalf,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
people
that
are
in
the
urban
areas
at
this
time.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
of
the
sixth
circuit's
decision?
they
both
have
to
be
done?
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
absolutely
not.
that's
precisely
why
i'm
here
today.
i
maintain
that
the
kentucky
legislature
is
allowed
to
prescribe
the
method
of
service
in
the
fundamental
area
of
landlord
and
tenants.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
lower
court
was
reversed.
they
held
that
they
were
compelled
by
the
mullane
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
to
find
this
statute
unconstitutional,
as
it
would
be
so
easy
to
add
mailing.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
absolutely.
i've
been
advised
by--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--yes,
sir,
number
one.
and
number
two,
i've
been
advised
that
it's
the
state
of
the
law
today,
the
plaintiffs
believe,
that
only
personal
service
will
be
satisfactory
as
this
statute
has
been
ruled
unconstitutional
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
procedure
in
landlord
and
tenants
cases
other
than
to...
in
my
experience...
hire
bounty
hunters
to
watch
for
the
tenant
and
a
special
bailiff
and
finally
get
him
personally
served.
so
that
is
one
of
the
crying
reasons
that
we
have
to
be
here,
number
one.
number
two,
i
would
point
out
that
all
of
the
sophisticated
legislation
of
the
landlord
and
tenants
law
was
passed
in
1974.
our
legislature
meets
every
two
years.
since
that
time
we've
had
four
legislatures.
in
each
of
those
instances
they
have
chosen
not
to
amend
or
alter
the
forcible
due
process
posting
service
method.
now,
the
amicus
point
out
that
there
are
17
states
that
have
this
type
of
statute.
we
believe
that
this
statute
in
and
of
itself,
as
the
legislature
has
found,
and
in
fact
written
a
law,
is
constitutionally
sufficient.
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be
much
more
comfortable
for
me
here
this
afternoon
if
i
could
say
that
this
also
has
mailing.
in
fact,
maybe
possibly
the
sixth
circuit
would
have
had
no
problem
with
it
had
it
said
mailing,
but
it
doesn't
say
mailing,
number
one.
number
two,
the
mailing
issue
in
and
of
itself
was
somewhat
unclear
to
me
in
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
as
they
cite
the
new
york
case,
which
is
the
one
of
three
or
four
cases
where
this
has
been
legitimately
addressed.
and
in
the
new
york
case,
the
new
york
statute
provides
for
a
mailing
as
well.
judge...
the
lower
court,
district
court,
also
cited
that
case.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
well,
the
kentucky
attorney
general
asked
me
to
represent
the
state
in
this
matter
and
i
have
gone
forward
this
them,
and,
of
course,
they
allege
that
it's
constitutional.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
no,
sir.
this
is...
points
up
an
excellent
problem,
though.
the
louisville-jefferson
county
area
is
the
one
of
three
municipal
areas.
the
kentucky
legislature
is
very,
very
rural,
and
in
fact,
the
ultra
landlord
and
tenants
laws
are
currently
under
tremendous
attack
in
all
of
our
courts
and
have
been
for
sometime
and
hopefully
will
be
resolved
in
the
near
future
in
the
our
court
of
appeals
at
this
time
is
being
unconstitutional
special
legislation,
placing
much
higher
restrictions
and
requirements
on
urban
landlords
than
are
placed
on
them
in
the
balance
of
the
state.
if
this
court
were
to
sustain
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
that
it
would
be,
in
my
paraphrasing,
much
better
to
mail,
i
would
have
no
system
by
which
to
have
a
statute
passed
to
allow
for
that.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
justice
rehnquist
states
the
case
precisely.
that
is
what
we
are
here
about.
we
are
here
about
whether
or
not
posting
continues
to
be
due
process.
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
here
about.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
i
believe
so,
but
i
believe
it
will
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
distinguish
how
this...
how
mailing
can
be
added
to
this
statute.
how
mailing
can
be
determined
to
be
so
much
better
that
therefore,
this
statute
is...
lacks
due
process,
without
saying
at
the
same
time
that
posting
in
and
of
itself
is
no
longer
sufficient.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
yes,
sir,
and
then--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--yes,
sir,
and
that's
precisely
why
it's
wrong.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
i
would
say
first
of
all--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--i
would
say
first
of
all
that
it
would
be
improper
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
determining
the
evidence
that
was
presented
that
the
district
court
judge
had
already
decided
the
summary
judgment
matter
on,
because
there
was
very
little
evidence
and,
in
fact,
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
do
that.
they
merely
said
that
they
recognized
the
new
york
case
as
allowing
for
mailing,
and
as
mailing
was
appreciably
sure
to
get
there,
that
that
would
be
the
way
we
should
do
it
in
kentucky.
but
that,
in
fact,
is...
and
it
is
also
the
basis
of
the
method
which
the
court
in
the
sixth
circuit
reasoned
to
this
decision
that
makes
the...
our
office
feel
very
much
that
it
wasn't
necessary.
it
just
seemed
expedient,
it
seemed
so
much
better.
it's
easy
to
stand
here
and
say
well,
look,
you're
bound
to
get
the
mail.
that's
not
always
true.
in
my
experience,
yes,
you're
bound
to
the
mail.
but
look
how
much
easier
it
is
to
mail
it,
and
therefore,
the
old
system
is
improper.
but
in
fact,
the
way
they
got
to
that
decision
was
to
go
back
to
the
international
shoe,
to
the
pennoyer
versus
neff
matters
which
were
built
on
fictions
of
in
personam
jurisdiction,
on
that
kind
of
jurisdictional
problem,
and
they
gave
very
little
attention
to
what
we
believe
and
what
i
think,
in
fact,
are
the
exact
questions
presented
here
today...
the
mullane
versus
hanover
trust.
that's
what
we're
here
about.
we're
not
here
about
jurisdiction,
we're
not
here
about
what
might
be
a
better
process.
we're
here
about
whether
this
satisfies
mullane
versus
central
hanover
trust.
and
quite
simply,
it
is
our
position
that
posting
in
this
matter
gave
notice
when
the
tenant
didn't
pay
the
rent,
they
knew
about
it.
the
test
in
hanover,
the
test
in
all
of
the
due
process
cases
is
whether
from
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
person
was
reasonably
calculated
to
have
notice.
and
in
this
matter,
the
tenant
has
not
paid
his
rent.
he
knows
that.
and
that
brings
up
the
difference
in
the
rights
which
was
not
addressed
at
all
by
the
sixth
circuit.
the
landlord's
original
rights
were
to
take
by
reasonable
violence
his
property.
self-help.
then
forcible
eviction
statutes
like
this
were
passed
under
the
police
powers
to
obviate
violence,
quarrels
and
bloodshed.
finally,
in
your
lindsey
versus
normet
decision
and
in
a
number
of
decisions,
it's
unquestionably
justified
to
have
special
statutory
treatment
of
landlord
and
tenant
matters.
in
this
situation,
the
landlord's
duties
under
the
safety
codes
and
the
health
codes,
the
fire
codes,
the
mortgages,
the
interest
rates,
they've
been
escalating
the
entire
time.
and
the
tenant's
duties
had
been
to
remain
in
quiet
possession
and
to
pay
his
rent.
the
tenant
determines
that
he's
going
to
breach
his
duty.
the
tenant
has
not
duty
whatsoever
of
any
inquiry,
no
duty
to
be
alert
for
the
fact
that
the
landlord
would
be
unhappy
with
this?
that
seems
to
us
impossible,
and
in
fact,
is
part
of
the
absolute
justification
why
this
is
reasonably
calculated.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
that's
true
at
all.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
i
believe...
is
it
an
excuse
not
to
pay
your
rent?
a
reason
not
to
pay
your
rent?
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
we
don't
believe
so.
we
don't
believe
that
he
has
a
right
of
self-help,
that
he
can
just
not
pay
his
rent.
we
do
believe
he
can
send
his
landlord
notice
and
advise,
just
as
the
landlord
must
advise
the
tenant,--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--pardon?
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
i
don't
understand
it
to
be
that
at
all,
sir.
that's
not
the
case.
the
remedy
may
be
brought
whether
he's
in
possession
or
not.
383.685...
he
may
bring
an
action
against
his
landlord
to
remedy
these
problems,
and
he
may,
in
a
proper
fashion,
withhold
his
rent
by
sending
the
landlord
notice.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
counsel
will
address
this
argument
that
in
fact,
this
is
no
longer
in
rem,
this
is
no
longer
solely
a
question
of
possession,
though
the
kentucky
case
that
is
currently
the
law
of
the
matter
states
that
that
is
all
that
the
forcible
eviction
matter
is
because
the
tenant
has
a
right
to
counterclaim.
it's
our
position
that
the
tenant
also
has
an
independent
right.
this
right
is
to
withhold
his
rent.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
he
can
under
the
new
uniform
landlord
and
tenant
law,
if
he
seeks
that
remedy
as
well.
however,
it
is
not...
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
this
statute,
454.030,
the
one
under
attack,
would
provide
him
service
or
process
in
that
manner.
that
would,
in
fact,
be
an
in
personam
matter
that
would
require
personal
service.
and
in
fact,
no
landlord
does
sue
in
any
of
these
matters,
in
any
of
the
matters
before
the
court.
no
landlord
has
sued
that
way,
nor
in
my
experience
does
a
landlord
ever
sue.
they
solely
want
the
possession
of
the
property
back.
however,
if
they
did
sue
for
rent
as
well,
then
this
statute,
454,
would
not
apply.
it
would
not
be
solely
the
matter
of
the
writ.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
no,
sir.
as
i
understand
our
rule
4,
it's
similar
to
the
federal
rule--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
not
if--
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
--if
the
kentucky
legislature
had
deemed
that
that
kind
of
action
for
back
rent,
absolutely
constitutionally
sufficient.
i'll
sit
down
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
william
l.
hoge,
iii
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
title
of
the
statute
in
question,
454.030,
forcible
entry
or
detainer,
how
notice
served.
it
only
applies
to
that
statute.
