mr.
robert
frederick
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
my
it
please
the
court:
before
i
get
to
my
prepared
remarks
i
would
like
to
address,
if
i
may,
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
has
previously
asked.
i
am
perhaps
at
a
bit
of
advantage
from
mr.
hoge
in
that
i've
had
an
opportunity
to
practice
tenant-landlord
law
for
quite
sometime
with
our
office.
and
i
don't
want
this
court
to
have
an
incorrect
impression
of
what
the
law
may
be.
mr.
hoge
was
correct
when
he
says
that
sometimes,
a
landlord
may
send
a
letter
requesting
the
rental
payment,
but
i
can
tell
you
from
my
experience,
most
landlords
do
not
send
a
letter.
and
the
provision
of
the
law
under
which
the
letter
is
sent
is
under
the
uniform
residential
landlord-tenant
act.
mr.
hoge
is
correct
in
pointing
out
to
this
court
that
that
act
currently
applies
to
only
three
of
kentucky's
100...
excuse
me,
two
of
kentucky's
118
counties,
and
one
additional
city.
in
all
other
counties
in
kentucky,
the
landlord
is
not
required
to
send
a
letter
prior
to
a
writ
being
initiated.
and
i
would
also
say
that
even
if
the
landlord
were
required
to
send
a
letter,
and
even
if
the
landlord
does
send
a
letter,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
under
kentucky
law,
that
letter
must
be
hand-delivered
or
sent
by
registered
mail.
and
even
if
the
tenant
gets
that
letter,
there
is
no
court
date
on
it,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
letter
in
and
of
itself
calls
the
person
to
court,
because
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
in
the
limited
area
in
which
it
is
used,
it
may
raise
the
possibility
that
a
landlord
may
go
to
court.
but
like
i
said,
my
experience
has
been
there
are
numerous,
close
to
90
%
of
the
cases
that
i
have
been
involved
in,
the
landlord
has
not
sent
the
letter.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
sir.
in
the
area
in
which
i
practice,
the
uniform
act
is
in
effect,
and
in
each
case
that
i
am
participating
in,
the
landlord
should
have
sent
the
letter.
and
in,
like
i
said,
in
the
numbers
of
cases
that
i
have
mentioned
to
you,
they
do
not
do
so.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
that's
a
very
interesting
question.
i
think
that
this
court
must
look
at
the
peculiarity
of
the
current
application
of
the
uniform
residential
landlord-tenant
act.
but
it
is
our
position
that
with
regard
to
posting,
posting
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
reasonably
calculated
to
appraise
the
tenant
of
pending
litigation.
now,
mr.
hoge
has
mentioned
that
there
is
another
writ
that
is
sent
out
by
the
kentucky
courts.
that
is
true,
but
that
writ
is
sent
out
only
after
a
judgment
has
been
entered.
and
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
some
of
the
cases,
again,
that
i
have
been
involved
with,
that
writ
is
not
received
by
the
tenant
until
after
the
judgment
is
there,
and
after
the
time
to
appeal
has
lapsed.
there
is
kentucky
law
which
indicates
that
if
you
do
not
appeal
an
unfavorable
decision
in
the
kentucky
district
court,
the
tenant-landlord
court,
the
circuit
court
which
is
the
next
highest
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
any
sort
of
remedial
action.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
i
might
also
add
that
mr.
hoge
indicated
that
the
tenants
had
not
paid
their
rent
in
this
particular
case.
long,
long
ago
and
far,
far
away
that
may
have
been
true.
but
in
fact,
what
occurred
was
the
people
offered
their
rent
and
the
rent
was
refused
by
the
public
housing
authorities.
and
if
you
will
note
in
our
record,
we
initiated
litigation
involving
the
public
housing
authorities,
and
that
particular
issue,
the
payment
of
rent,
was
settled
favorably
to
the
tenants.
the
case
that
mr.
hoge
had
requested
is
a
case
called
tinsley
versus
majorna.
it's
240
s.w.
2d,
539.
it's
a
1951--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--no,
sir.
if
you
prefer,
i
can
go
on
with--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--all
right.
because
i
thought
that
the
court
was
interested
and
was
willing
to
answer
the
questions.
but
i've
got
some
other
remarks
and
i'll
be
glad
to
go
with
them.
we
in
kentucky
with
a
minority
of
other
states
have
a
method
of
service
of
process
which
has
come
from
a
time
that
has
long
since
passed.
this
same
method
of
process
risks
our
state
court
and
those
like
it
in
becoming
a
landlord's
rubber
stamp,
despite
your
warnings
and
ruling
in
pernell
versus
southall
realty.
posting
simply
does
not
withstand
constitutional
scrutiny
at
this
time
because
it
is
not
reasonably
calculated,
nor
reasonably
certain
to
appraise
the
tenant
of
the
pending
litigation.
before
i
get
into
the
constitutional
ramifications
before
this
court,
however,
i
would
like
to
take
just
one
moment
to
discuss
the
importance
of
an
eviction
action
in
state
courts.
possession
is
no
longer
the
sole
issue
before
a
court
in
an
eviction
matter.
tenants...
excuse
me.
landlords,
in
addition
to
possession,
are
now
requesting
back
payment
of
rent,
which
is
permitted
under
kentucky
statute.
tenants
are
defending
their
rights
to
stay
in
their
homes
and
are
counterclaiming
for
damages,
usually
based
upon
a
landlord's
failure
to
provide
essential
services
and
repairs
to
the
property.
there
has--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--no,
ma'am,
i
disagree
with
mr.
hoge.
the
posting
statute
which
allows
the
three-tier
process
but
that
final
tier
being
posting,
is
an
avenue
available
to
a
landlord
to
request
both
possession
and
for
back
rent.
and
that
is
in
the
kentucky
revised
statute
section
383.
i
would
guess
it's.685,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
the
balance
of
that
is.
but
in
kentucky,
in
those
jurisdictions
that
have
urlta
you
may
not
only
request
possession,
but
you
may
also
request
back
rent.
clearly,
there
has
been
a
great
change
in
the
tenant-landlord
law.
appellants
argue
that
posting
satisfies
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
strongly
urge
this
court
to
reject
these
arguments.
if
you
look
at
the
essential
legal
argument
of
the
appellants,
and
then
view
our
discussion
of
westmoreland,
sullivan
that
were
contained
in
the
washington
amicus
brief
and
in
our
brief,
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
the
legal
authority
upon
which
they
have
relied
has
been
greatly
diminished.
and
with
regard
to
their
major
factual
argument
that
posting
is
a
third
alternative
and
a
closely-controlled
process,
again,
the
record
developed
for
this
court
and
for
the
washington
experience
clearly
indicate--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--yes,
sir,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
there
was
an
amicus
brief
filed
pointing
out
some
of
the
problems.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
but
our
record
shows
that
posting,
which
is
a
most
unreliable
form
of
notice,
is
that
which
is
commonly
used.
now,
in
our
record,
you
can
find
the
following:
first,
that
writs
are
used,
the
sixth
circuit
found,
in
an
overwhelming...
excuse
me,
in
50
%
of
the
time
writs
are
posted
as
the
form
of
notice.
a
deposition
that
is
in
the
record--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--pardon?
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
sir,
i'll
be
glad
to
check.
i
don't
want
to
mis-state
the
record.
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
4,
the
first
literary
paragraph,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six
seven
rows
down
it
says,
fifty
percent
of
the
summons
were
served
via
posting,
and
that
not
infrequently,
the
posted
summons
were
removed
by
people
other
than
those
served.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
i'm
just
trying
to
point
out
that
posting
is
an
unreliable
process
and
that
it
is
a
process
that
is
used
by
sheriffs
all
too
frequently.
also,
in
the
depositions
that
were
taken
in
this
case,
there
are
two
particular
process
servers
who
you
wanted
to
look
at.
one
is
a
guy
named
hansford.
he
said
that
75
%
of
the
writs
that
he
served
were
by
posting.
and
in
a
deposition
that
was
taken
for
the
plaintiffs
on
page
76,
questions
37
and
38
indicate
that
posting
was
also
used
by
this
particular
process
server
in
the
majority
of
times.
and
also
from
our
record
you
know
that
the
process
servers,
having
been...
when
they
were
in
the
office
of
the
courts,
were
aware
of
tenants
who
had
complained
about
never
having
received
their
writs.
were
also--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--yes,
sir,
it
is.
i'll
be
glad
to
get
that
for
you.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
it
is.
and
that
a
sample
that
was
obtained
through
interrogatories
in
this
case
of
173
judgments
that
were
entered
by
a
particular
court
at
a
particular
time,
150
were
done
by
default.
and
the
court
was
unable
to
tell
us
in
our
discovery
which
of
these
writs
were
served
by
posting,
which
were
served
by
substituted
service
and
which
were
served
by
in-hand
service.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir.
but
our
position
would
be
that
tenants,
particularly
these
public
housing
tenants,
who
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
and
tenants
who
live
in
jurisdictions
where
there
are
writs
of
forcible
entry
and
detainer...
excuse
me,
where
there
is
the
warranty
of
habitability...
are
extremely
foolish
and
would
take
advantage
of
the
court
process
and
would
not
ignore
the
writ
of
forcible
entry
detainer
because
it
is
through
the
courts
that
they'll
get
their
repairs.
and
if
they
lose
this
apartment,
particularly
those
people
in
subsidized
housing
and
in
public
housing,
they
are
going
to
lose,
frankly,
an
excellent
economic
bargain,
and
they
are
not
so
foolish
as
to
ignore
that.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
sir,
but
i'm
saying
that
if,
in
fact,
tenants
receive
the
writ,
there
are
reasons
why
they
would
not
want
to
ignore
it.
and
the
reasons
being
they'd
lose
the
basis
of
their
economic
bargain
in
public
housing
and
subsidized
housing
particularly.
in
housing
in
which
there
are
repairs
that
are
needed,
this
is
an
excellent
opportunity
to
go
to
court
and
use
the
arm
of
the
law
to
get
the
repairs
that
are
required
by
law.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
perhaps,
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
but
i...
there
may
be
a--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--perhaps,
justice
marshall,
that
may
be.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
there
are.
but
it
is
our
position...
and
what
we're
trying
to
convince
this
court
today
is
that
it
is
not
a
good
idea
for
many
tenants
in
the
position
that
these
tenants
are
in,
to
ignore
it.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
i
guess
if
they
wish
to
default
that's--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
we
believe
that--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--no,
ma'am.
posting
is
used
throughout
all
121
or
whatever
counties
there
are
in
kentucky.
it
is
particularly
unconstitutional
in
those
areas
where
a
tenant
is
being
requested
or
the
landlord
is
requesting
that
a
tenant
pay
rent
in
addition
to
possession.
it
is
particularly
unconstitutional
in
areas
where
some
sort
of
personal
judgment
is
being
sought.
but
we
believe
that
posting
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
regardless
of
where
it
is
used
in
kentucky.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
particularly
acute
in
multiple-housing
dwellings.
but
there
are
multiple-housing
dwellings
in
the
counties
in
kentucky.
the
problem
with
posting
is
that
the
dangers
that
beset
posting...
okay,
someone
else
coming
along,
the
ravages
of
the
elements...
these
are
just
as
available
in
the
counties
as
they
are
in
the
cities,
but
they
may
be
more
likely
in
the
cities.
we
believe
that
the
record
before
this
court
shows
that
the
sliver
of
scotch
tape
and
the
thumbtack
have
indeed
replaced
the
hard
rap
upon
the
door.
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
process
servers,
those
whose
deposition
we
have
taken,
indicate
that
they
know
that
tenants
don't
always
receive
their
writs,
they
know
they
get
torn
away.
they
also
know
that
there
are
times
when
the
property
itself
is
not
amenable
to
posting
and
they
have
to
fold
them
and
stick
them
in
a
doorjam,
which
is
even
a
less
unreliable
manner
of
notice.
so
appellant's
brief
also
concedes
the
point
that
there
are
times
when
tenants
do
not
receive
notice,
and
we
think
that
that's
very
important.
and
again,
as
i
mentioned,
common
sense
will
tell
you
that
a
piece
of
paper
exposed
to
the
ravages
of
the
elements
and
to
vandals
does
not
fare
well
at
all.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
notice
by
first
class
mail
in
this
particular
situation
would
be
adequate.
yes,
ma'am.
whether
you
supplement
posting
with
it
or
substitute
the
mail
for
posting.
i
think
under
either
set
of
circumstances
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
ma'am,
i
think
that...
one
of
the
things
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
was
the
mails,
both
their
delivery
and
once
it
rests
in
the
mailbox,
are
protected
by
the
federal
law.
mailboxes
are
much
more
private
than
something
that's
shown
and
is
available
to
anyone
to
come
along.
that
would
probably
be
the
point
that
we
were
trying
to
make.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
i
searched
for
that
particular
kentucky
law
and
i
found
none.
i
did
look.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that's
correct.
and
i
think
the
record
shows,
however,
that
posting
which
is
an
unreliable
form
of
notice,
is
that
that's
used
most
often
by
the
sheriffs.
and
one
part
of
the
proof
in
this
case
indicated
that
the
stamp
that
was
pre-printed
for
the
returns
on
the
back
of
these
writs
indicated
that
posting
was
the
first
method
of
process.
in
fact,
one
of
the
sheriffs,
whose
deposition
we
took,
was
not
even
aware
that
there
was
any
statutory
requirement
for
personal
or
substituted
service--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--yes,
sir,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
you
would.
kentucky
just
changed
their
civil
rules
to
allow
service
in
other
types
of
civil
cases
by
certified
mail,
in
addition
to
the
sheriff
handing
a
summons
to
you.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
sir,
my...
i'm
sorry
if
i
misled
you.
my
remarks
were
meant
to
say
mailing
as
a
supplement
to
or
a
substitute
for
posting
i
believe
would
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i'm
sorry
if
i
was
imprecise.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
the
current
law
would
not
be
satisfied
by
mail
because
it's
an
element
of
service
that's
not
contemplated
by
the
current
statute.
frankly,
my
answer
was
premised
upon
the
fact
that
we
would
prevail
in
this
case,
the
court
would
find
posting
unconstitutional,
and
then
what
is
kentucky
to
do.
and
what
kentucky
should
do
is
either
supplement
posting
with
first
class
mail
or
substitute
mail
for
posting.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
sir,
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes,
sir,
there
is.
we
had
numerous
plaintiffs
in
addition
to
our
individual
plaintiffs.
frankly,
one
of
our
plaintiffs
is
still
in
subsidized
housing
but
it
is
not
public
housing.
we
have
an
organizational
plaintiff,
the
louisville
tenant
union,
whose
job
it
is
as
an
organization
to
advocate
for
tenants.
they
are
sued
and
do
sue,
and
it
just
so
happens
that
i
am
their
general
counsel
and
have
participated
in
other
litigation
for
the
louisville
tenant
union.
and
they
are
also
a
named
plaintiff
in
this
case,
along
with
the
welfare
rights
organization.
i
am
more
familiar
with
the
tenant
union.
mr.
robert
frederick

if,
in
fact,
it
were
slipped
under
the
door,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
that's
how
they
got
this
second
writ
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
if
it
were
shown
that
it
were
reasonably
calculated
to
appraise
the
tenants
of
the
pending
proceeding,
we
would
not
be
here.
i
really
don't
know
what
the
stats
would
show
on
that,
i'm
sorry.
in
our
argument
this
afternoon
and
in
our
briefs,
we
believe
that
tenants
have
shown
that
posting
fails
to
meet
the
minimal
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
most
importantly,
fails
to
meet
the
test
that
was
espoused
by
mullane
and
its
progeny.
that
is,
that
where
the
names
and
addresses
of
individuals
are
easily
ascertained,
a
manner
of
service
no
less
reliable
than
the
mail
shall
be
used.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
the
weber
court
compared
it
to
publication,
justice
rehnquist.
and
also,
i
don't
believe
the
issue
is
well,
do
some
people
get
it.
mullane
disfavored
publication
because
it
said
well,
it
may
be
that
some
people
get
it,
but
it's
not
reasonably
calculated
to
appraise
most
of
the
individuals
who
should
get
it.
and
we
don't
think
that
posting
is
reasonably
calculated
to
appraise
most
individuals
who
should
get
it.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
we
believe
the
chance
is
much
too
great
with
regard
to
this
particular
scenario.
and
we
also
don't
want
to
be
bound
by
specific
numbers.
we
just
believe
that
what
we
have
shown
you
today
is
that
posting
is
not
reasonably
calculated.
i
mean,
due
process
isn't
a
mathematical
computation,
and
it's
bad
for
you
or
i
to
discuss
mathematical
computations
with
regard
to
due
process.
but
we
believe
that
this
record
shows
you
that
posting
is
not
reasonably
calculated.
in
balancing
the
harm
to
tenants
with
the
cost
of
constitutional
notice,
it
is
clear
that
the
scales
weigh
in
the
tenant's
favor.
cost
in
time
and
in
money
should
mailing
be
required
would
be
de
minimus.
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
tenants
are
easily
ascertainable.
reliance
upon
such
a
system
as
posting,
which
falls
below
the
de
minimal
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
test
established
in
mullane,
show
you
a
system
which
is
unconstitutional
and
must
be
struck.
thank
you.
