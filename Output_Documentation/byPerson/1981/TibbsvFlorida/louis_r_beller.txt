mr.
louis
r.
beller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
received
the
briefs,
both
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
and
the
answering
brief
from
the
state
of
florida.
i
think
the
question
has
been
misstated
in
the
answering
brief
for
the
state
of
florida.
the
question
that
they
cite
is
whether
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
precludes
retrial
of
the
petitioner
where
the
appellate
court,
acting
as
a
thirteenth
juror,
assessed
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
re-weighed
the
evidence,
concluding
that
although
the
evidence
was
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
sustain
the
verdicts,
the
petitioner
should
be
afforded
a
new
trial.
i
think
the
question
is
just
pure
and
simple,
as
stated
in
my
original
brief,
whether
or
not
the
double
jeopardy
applies
where
the
court
has
grounds
for
retrial
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
originally
weighed
and
found
the
evidence
insufficient
to
convict
the
petitioner.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
mr.
tibbs
is
in
chicago.
he
was...
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
case
was
discharged.
he
was
out
on
bond
at
that
particular
time,
but
of
course
the
bond
would
then
be
dropped.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
no,
he
is
not.
the
question
of
double
jeopardy,
as
opposed
to
weight,
is
presented
in
the
government's
brief
as
amicus
curiae,
and
they
say
it
would
affect
rule
33
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
rule
33
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
applies
to
the
trial
court,
who
in
effect
is
sitting
as
a
thirteenth
juror,
because
the
trial
court
does
see
the
evidence,
does
see
the
witnesses,
weighs
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.
i
don't
think
anything
that
this
court
does
in
the
delbert
tibbs
case
should
have
any
effect
upon
rule
33.
i
think
that's
a
good
rule.
the
trial
court
sitting
as
a
thirteenth
juror...
that's
the
trial
court,
not
an
appellate
court...
has
the
same
opportunity
as
the
parties
who
are
the
jurors
to
weigh
the
evidence.
and
if
the
trial
court
feels
under
rule
33
that
there
should
be
a
new
trial,
it
orders
a
new
trial
in
the
interest
of
justice.
now,
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
that
the
appellate
court
of
the
state
of
florida,
the
supreme
court,
who
is
the
direct
court
of
appeals
in
a
murder
trial,
under
rule
9.140
of
the
florida
rules
of
criminal
procedure...
or
appellate
procedure...
(f),
did
review
the
case
and
reviewed
the
totality
of
the
case,
did,
as
it
is
required
to
do,
did
a
total
review
of
the
evidence.
and
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
of
the
various
points
of
evidence
that
it
did
review.
but
what
it
did
was
this.
it
said
that
this
evidence
is
insufficient.
it
didn't
use
that
phraseology.
it
said
that
the
evidence
was...
there
were
insufficiencies
in
the
evidence.
there
were
things
about
the
evidence.
and
then
it
went
on
to
list--
mr.
louis
r.
beller
--correct.
they
concluded
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
for
a
reasonable
man
to
conclude
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
guilty.
and
that's
weighing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
they
concluded
by
saying,
rather
than
risk
the
very
real
possibility
that
tibbs
had
nothing
to
do
with
these
crimes,
we
reverse
his
conviction
and
remand
for
a
new
trial.
now,
this
happened
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
burks
and
greene,
and
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
by
justice
boyd
at
that
particular
time,
who
said,
i
believe
that
this
man
should
not
be
retried,
but
under
the
current
law
he
probably
can
be
retried.
burks
and
greene,
if
my
understanding
of
them
is
correct,
said
simply
this:
that
where
a
trial
court...
where
an
appellate
court
reweighs
the
evidence
and
finds
that
the
evidence
is
not
enough
to
convict
beyond
and
to
the
exclusion
of
every
reasonable
doubt,
that
it's
the
same
as
finding
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
and
that
he
cannot
retry
them
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
when
they
reviewed
their
initial
decision,
yes,
they
said
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
but
that
was
prior
to
burks
and
greene,
and
burks
and
greene
simply
set
up
the
proposition
that
you
did
not
waive
the
right
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
by
asking
for
a
new
trial.
i
think
previous
to
that
the
law
was
that
if
you
applied
to
an
appellate
court
for
a
new
trial
and
the
court
granted
you
a
new
trial,
it
was
simply
doing
what
you
asked
for
and
you
had
waived
your
right
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
when
you
got
your
new
trial,
even
if
it
was
a
question
of
evidentiary
insufficiency.
and
the
problem
here
is,
what
did
they
reverse
on.
they
did
set
up
a
series
of
nine
various
deficiencies,
and
they
all
go
to
evidentiary
weight.
none
of
them
go
to
any
question
of
a
legal
insufficiency,
whether
or
not
he
had
admitted
something
improperly,
whether
or
not
a
question
had
been
asked
that
should
have
been
excluded.
none
of
these
were
raised.
so
it
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
entire
evidence
was
sufficient
to
convict.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
let
me
apply
it
to
the
second
opinion.
the
second
opinion,
through
the
fifth
section
of
the
second
opinion...
in
fact,
when
i
read
the
second
opinion...
and
you'll
find
that
the
dissenting
judges
all
concur
in
it
through
roman
numeral
number
v,
their
fifth
section,
which
is
the
majority
of
the
second
opinion.
the
second
opinion
reviews
the
district
court,
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
opinion,
which
said
that
he
should
be
retried
because
the
reversal
was
not
based
on
insufficiency,
but
was
based
on
weight
of
the
evidence,
that
though
there
was
enough
evidence
to
legally
convict
tibbs,
yet
because
of
the
weight
in
the
interest
of
justice
they
felt
he
should
have
a
new
trial.
they
went
through
and
reviewed
it,
the
majority
in
second
opinion,
and
they
said,
well,
weight
and
insufficiency
are
so
close
we're
never
going
to
do
that
again.
in
fact,
quoting
from
their
second
opinion...
and
this
is
from
the
joint
appendix
on
page
19:
"henceforth,
no
appellate
court
should
reverse
a
conviction
or
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
tenuous
or
insubstantial.
"
"cases
now
pending
on
appeal
which
a
court
has
characterized
the
reversal
as
based
on
evidentiary
weight
should
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
our
decision
today,
and
under
the
doctrine
of
burks
and
greene
any
retrial
of
those
cases
may
or
may
not
be
barred
on
the
basis
of
former
jeopardy.
"
mr.
louis
r.
beller
i
would
agree
with
that.
what
they
said
is
that
they're
never
going
to
do
it
again.
but
what
they
said
is
that
in
this
particular
case
they
had
reversed
on
the
weight.
now,
there
really
have
been
no
supreme
court
cases
that
establish
weight
versus
insufficiency.
and
as
i
said,
through
paragraph
five...
i
thought,
in
fact,
when
i
read
the
case
through
number
five,
i
thought
i
had
won
the
case.
i
thought
that
they
were
going
to
let
tibbs
go.
and
if
you
look
at
the
concurring
opinions...
the
dissenting
opinions,
they
all
agree
through
paragraph
five,
because
the
court
does,
it
dissects...
dissects;
pardon
me...
the
original
application
of
weight
versus
insufficiency,
and
says
it's
too
hard
to
determine.
in
fact,
they
went
through...
if
you
look
at,
and
i'm
sure
you
have...
but
they
went
through
and
delineated
all
the
cares
in
florida
that
had
used
the
weight
theory
and
said
that
they
were
very
tenuous,
and
that
most
of
these
cases
were
reversed
on
insufficient
evidence,
and
therefore,
as
i
said
before,
they
then
concluded
that
no
court
should
reverse
on
the
weight
again.
however,
they
left
in
effect
rule
9.140(f)
of
the
florida
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
and
that
rule
says:
"in
the
interest
of
justice,
the
court
may
grant
any
relief
to
which
any
of
the
parties
is
entitled
in
capital
cases.
"
"in
capital
cases.
"
--and
this
was
a
capital
case...
"court
shall
review
the
evidence
to
determine
if
the
interest
of
justice
requires
a
new
trial,
whether
or
not
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
an
issue
presented
for
review.
"
but
then
they
went
on
to
say
that
if
a
court
does
under
9.140
review
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
sufficient
and
reverses...
and
this
is,
i'm
quoting
from
21,
the
second
paragraph.
this
is
from
the
joint
appendix:
"with
respect
to
the
special
mention
of
capital
cases
in
the
second
sentence
of
the
rule,
we
take
that
sentence
to
mean
no
more
than
that
an
additional
review
requirement
is
imposed
when
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
not
specifically
raised
on
appeal...
namely,
that
the
reviewing
court
shall
consider
sufficiency
anyhow
and,
if
it
warranted,
reverse
the
conviction.
"
"the
consequence
of
that
action
would
be
to
bar
retrial
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
"
they're
saying
if
a
court
does
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
it
would
bar
it.
now,
i
raised
this
point
in
my
brief
and
i
think
it's
important
to
raise
the
point,
because
it's
a
question
of
interpretation
of
what
the
court
originally
said.
the
three
dissents
here,
the
three
justices
that
say
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
and
there
is
a
very...
and
i
quoted
extensively
from
justice
sundberg's
opinion
in
my
brief,
because
i
think
he
said
it
better
than
i
can.
but
the
three
justices
there
were
part
of
the
original
majority
that
had
reversed
for
a
new
trial.
there
was
only
one
justice
of
the
original
majority
that
didn't
join
in,
and
the
reason
he
didn't
join
in
is
because
he
wasn't
on
the
court,
as
far
as
i
could
determine.
and
nobody
can
read
the
man's
mind,
of
course.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
people
who
wrote
the
opinion...
justice
england,
who
wrote
the
opinion,
the
original
opinion,
said
in
the
interest
of
justice
we
should
let
him
go.
what
he's
doing
is
applying...
and
he
did
quote
rule
9.140(f).
what
he's
doing
is
saying,
under
rule
9.140(f),
as
the
majority
said
here,
we
reviewed
the
evidence,
we
found
it
insufficient,
therefore
double
jeopardy
bars
a
retrial.
in
the
interest
of
justice
he
should
not
be
retried.
and
he
did
it
very
shortly.
justice
englander
in
his
dissent
said,
i
agree
with
the
court
through
part
five.
i
agree
with
the
court
through
part
five,
too.
justice
sundberg
in
his
dissent
started
out
with
saying,
i
agree
with
the
court
through
part
five.
because
through
part
five
the
court
says,
we
shouldn't
use
the
standard
of
weight
or
insufficiency,
because
weight
is
too
tenuous.
and
then
they
finally
come
they
do
come
to
the
conclusion
in
this
particular
case
that
they
had
made
an
error,
that
they
had
used
the
standard
of
weight
rather
than
insufficiency.
and
they
said
we
could
do
three
things.
we
could
vacate
our
original
order
and
say
that
we
shouldn't
have
reversed
and
sustain
the
original
conviction.
we
can
send
back
for
a
new
trial.
or
we
could
release
him.
and
we
think
of
the
three
we
should
do
the
medium
thing,
which
is
send
back
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
sure.
i
really
do
not
think
that
the
first
option
is
a
viable
option,
where
they
could
say
at
this
late
date
their
original
conviction
should
stand.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
to
a
certain
extent,
i
think
every
court
sits
as
a
jury,
though
the
law...
and
they
fairly
pronounce
what
they
consider
law
now.
they
say,
we
should
not
sit
as
a
juror,
we
should
not
do...
we
should
just
determine
whether
as
a
legal
matter
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
and
i
think
that's
what
they
did
determine,
because,
just
to
give
you
a
brief
resume
of
the
case,
because
i
know
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
briefs,
this
was
a
one-witness
case.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
but
there
is
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make--
mr.
louis
r.
beller
--i'm
asking
you
to
determine
what
the
florida
court
did
in
the
original
tibbs
decision
in
the
light
of
burks
and
greene,
which
is
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
particular
court.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
whether
they
call
it
weight
or
insufficiency,
if
the
court
ruled
on
the
evidence
and
didn't
rule
on
any
legal
point
other
than
just
the
evidence,
that
brings
it
within
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
i
think
that's
a
different
situation,
because
the
trial
court
is
a
thirteenth
juror.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
under
rule
9.140
the
court
has
left
itself
that
option.
it
says
they
should
never
reverse...
review
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
but
then
again,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
set
out
what
it
can
do.
it
said
under
rule
9.140(f),
if
we
do
review
the
evidence
and
determine
that
it's
not
enough,
then
they
say
the
consequence
of
that
act
would
be
to
bar
retrial
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
what
we're
saying
is
the
original
court
didn't
know
burks
and
greene.
burks
and
greene
came
afterwards.
the
original
court
did
sit
down
and
did
an
extensive
review
of
the
evidence
and
found
it
lacking
to
convict
beyond
and
to
the
exclusion
of
every
reasonable
doubt.
and
actually,
they
came
within
the
standards,
i
think,
that
were
set
by
this
court
in--
0--
this
court
has
set
various
standards,
and
that's
the
standard,
is
beyond
the
exclusion
of
every
reasonable
doubt.
if
you
don't
come
to
that
standard...
and
justice
sundberg
set
out
the
case.
i
think
it
was
scott,
but
let
me
find
it.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
i
think
that's
very
possible,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
trial
court
should
not
have.
the
florida
law
does
allow
conviction
by
testimony
of
just
the
prosecutrix
alone,
unsubstantiated
testimony.
however,
what
the
florida
supreme
court
says,
in
that
instance
there
must
be
some
other,
however
tenuous,
corroborating
evidence.
and
that's
why
they
said
in
this
case
there
was
nothing
but
cynthia
nadeau's
word.
there's
nothing
to
show
the
man
was
a
resident
of
the
area,
that
he
was
ever
in
the
area,
that
he
had
ever
seen
the
person
before,
or
that
she
knew
him
or
any
otherwise.
and
in
most
convictions
where
there
is
a
prosecutrix's
testimony
alone
they
have
something
else
to
substantiate.
they
went
through
a
whole
series.
again,
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
the
various
criteria
that
they
went
through.
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
he
had
owned
a
car.
there
was
nothing
to
show
he
had
ever
been
in
that
particular
area.
there
was
nothing
substantiating
her
testimony
in
and
of...
naked
testimony...
in
and
of
itself,
other
than
the
factor
that
there
was
a
so-called
confession
to
an
inmate
within
the
jail,
which
the
court
discounted,
because
i
think
this
court
is
familiar
and
every
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that
you
can
get
people
in
jail
to
say
anything
if
it
will
lessen
their
sentence
one
day.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
well,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
original
first
court,
the
surviving
members
of
the
original
majority
have
all
said
that
their
vote
was
on
insufficiency.
justice
sundberg
wrote
the
largest
dissent
and
he
clearly
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
his
original
opinion
in
concurrence
was
on
insufficiency.
justice
boyd
says
it.
and
justice
englander
says,
i
concur
with
the
court
through
section
five,
but
then
i
use
florida
rule
9.140(f)
and--
mr.
louis
r.
beller
--i
think
so.
and
also,
the
expression
is
by
the
second
court,
the
majority
in
the
second
court.
two
of
the
majority
in
the
second
court
were
the
dissents
in
the
first
court.
they
would
have
upheld
the
original
conviction.
and
two
are
new
members
of
the
court.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
i
certainly
think
they
did.
and
certainly...
let's
not
lose
sight
of
one
particular
aspect
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
frankly,
that's
exactly
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
means
to
me,
is
that
the
state
doesn't
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
that
the
state,
if
it
doesn't
have
sufficient
evidence
or
enough
evidence
or
the
weight
of
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial...
what
ever
you
want
to
call
it,
but
the
court
says
it
has
to
be
enough
evidence
to
convince
a
person
beyond
and
to
the
exclusion
of
every
reasonable
doubt,
and
if
the
appellate
court
says
that
they
didn't
have
that
much
evidence
then--
mr.
louis
r.
beller
--the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
said
it
didn't
do
that
in
this
particular
case.
it
said,
we
specifically
reserve
the
right
under
rule
9.140(f)
to
grant
new
trials
in
the
interest
of
justice.
then
they
want
on
to
interpret
it
and
say,
if
under
9.140(f)
we
reweigh
the
evidence,
then
double
jeopardy
applies.
at
least
that's
my
thinking
of
what
they
said,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they're
clear
in
what
they
said
in
that
particular
paragraph.
they
said
in
this
particular...
they
didn't
say
we
grant...
and
that's
where
i
take
issue
with
the
brief
of
the
state.
nowhere
did
they
say
in
there
that
we're
granting
a
new...
that
we
granted
a
new
trial
in
the
interest
of
justice
in
the
original
case.
they
said
we
made
a
mistake
in
the
original
case.
they
said
we
reweighed
the
evidence.
we
used
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
which
we
shouldn't
use;
that
an
appellate
court
should
just
act
on
whether
or
not
the
evidence
is
legally
sufficient
or
not.
they
said,
but
we
don't
preclude
an
appellate
court
granting
a
new
trial
under
rule
9.140(f).
and
then
they
went
on
to
say
that
if
they
do
consider
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
under
rule
9.140(f),
in
light
of
burks
and
greene
they
would
have
to
say
that
he
could
not
be
retried.
there
was
no
other
consideration,
no
other
technical
consideration,
other
than
the
evidence.
and
i
think
that
the
majority
in
this
court
states
the
law
right
and
comes
to
the
wrong
conclusion
to
a
certain
extent.
and
that's
why
the
dissents
all
joined
in
through
paragraph
five,
through
section
five
of
the
majority's
opinion,
in
that
the
weight
and
insufficiency
are
so
hard
to
distinguish,
even
for
a
court;
whether
or
not
i
have
insufficient
money
or
the
weight
of
the
money
is
great
enough,
or
coffee
or
whatever.
it's
a
tenuous
aspect
that
an
appellate
court
shouldn't
get
into.
the
appellate
court,
if
there
is
legally
sufficient
evidence,
should
not
reverse.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
under
that
supposition,
granting
the
rule
and
not
knowing
what
the
court's
consideration
was,
he
might
be
able
to
be
retried.
maybe
at
that
point
there
should
be
a
motion
for
clarification
of
the
court's
ruling,
trying
to
find
out
what--
mr.
louis
r.
beller
--if
i
were
a
defense
attorney
and
if
there
were
nothing
that
the
court
had
considered
other
than
in
the
tibbs
case,
i
would
make
the
same
motion
that
i
made
before
the
trial
court
now.
because
if
the
court
just
considers
evidence
and
it
does
not
consider
technical
objects,
whether
they
call
it
weight,
whether
they
call
it
insufficiency,
whatever
label
they
put
on
it,
they're
saying
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
convict
this
particular
party.
and
that's
insufficient.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
i
think
the
court
has
that
option.
but
they
did
elect
to
identify
what
they
reversed
it
under
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
in
the
first
opinion.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
you
can't
possibly...
you
can't
separate
the
two,
because
the
second
opinion
is
an
interpretation
of
what
the
first
opinion
meant.
the
second
opinion
is
saying,
based
on
our
first
opinion,
we
think
we
did
this
and
we
think
we
did
that.
so
there's
no
way
to
separate
it.
it
doesn't
exist
in
a
vacuum
in
and
of
itself.
it
would
be
meaningless
to
read
the
second
opinion
without
reading
the
first
opinion,
because
that's
what
the
court's
doing.
it's
saying,
we're
rereading
our
opinion
in
the
light
of
burks
and
greene,
which
are
new
cases,
and
we're
determining
whether
or
not
we
reverse
on
weight
or
insufficiency.
and
what
they
did
say
was,
we
reversed
on
weight
in
this
particular
case,
though
we've
never
done
it
before,
and
we're
never
going
to
do
it
again.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
it
might
be,
unless
there's
some
even
very
faint
corroboration.
i
think
that
most
cases
that
have
held
eyewitness
testimony
to
be
the
sole
convicting
factor
have
had
some
strands
of
corroboration.
and
that's
what
the
court
went
into,
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
the
vaguest
point
of
corroboration
other
than
her
story,
and
that
there
were
reasons
to
judge
her
story
suspect,
not
the
least
of
which
was
the
factor
that
she
made
an
identification
based
on
solely
a
photographic
exhibition
of
delbert
tibbs.
in
fact,
i
didn't
handle
the
original
appeal,
but
that
strikes
me
as
almost
the
classic
example
of
fruits
of
a
poisonous
tree.
it
was
mentioned
in
passing
by
the
court,
not
as
a
major
reason
for
the
reversal,
but
as
the
reason
to
suspect
nadeau's
testimony,
to
find
that
her
testimony
wasn't
completely
within
the
bounds
of
the
law,
that
it
was
based
on
a
faulty
exhibition
of
just
these
photographs
of
tibbs.
she
saw
three
photographs
of
tibbs
himself,
as
part
of
the
original
testimony.
that
white
light
bothers
me.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
well,
let
me
sum
up,
then,
if
i
may.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
all
right.
i
will
reserve
that
time,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
well,
just
shortly,
your
honor,
the
state
has
brought
up
the
district
court
of
appeals
review
of
various
courts.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
joint
appendix,
page
16,
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
reviewed
all
those
cases
that
the
appellate
court
brought
up
and
said
they
all
were
reversals
on
insufficient
evidence,
in
the
concluding
paragraph.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
problem
that
this
court
faced
in
greene
and
burks,
the
old
problem
of,
if
you
ask
for
a
new
trial
you
waive
your
right
to
double
jeopardy.
certainly
any
defendant
faced
with
the
possibility
of
either
affirmation
of
a
conviction
or
a
new
trial
will
take
the
new
trial,
if
the
court
put
it
in
that
blunt
words.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
because
subsequent
this
court
said
that's
exactly
what
we
should
win,
that
we
don't
waive
our
rights
to
new
trial...
pardon
me,
i
may
have
answered
you
wrong.
i
didn't
argue
the
original
appellate
court
decision,
the
appeal.
i
argued
the
second
appeal.
mr.
louis
r.
beller
all
right.
i
would
just
reaffirm
that
we
feel
that
the
test
in
scott
and
this
decision
of
the
court
in
scott
applies
the
standards.
thank
you.
