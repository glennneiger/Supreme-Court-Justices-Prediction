mr.
beller,
where
is
mr.
tibbs
now?
unknown
speaker
but
he
is
not
incarcerated
now?
unknown
speaker
did
they
not
say
in
effect
there
was
not
enough
evidence
here
for
the
jury
to
reach
the
verdict
that
it
reached?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beller,
i
thought
the
trial
court
simply
made
a
determination
that
in
the
interest
of
justice
the
defendant
should
have
a
new
trial.
they
pointed
out
seven
so-called
weaknesses
in
the
state's
case
and
then
said
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
their
second
opinion
they
certainly
take
a
different
view
of
what
they
did
in
their
first
opinion
than
you
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
call
your
attention
to
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
part
of
part
five
of
the
court's
second
opinion,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
they
say:
"the
fact
remains
that
we
cannot
fairly
conclude
from
our
original
opinion
that
tibbs'
convictions
were
reversed
on
the
grounds
of
evidentiary
insufficiency.
"
now,
don't
you
agree
that
at
least
the
second
time
around
in
interpreting
their
first
opinion
they
said
that
they
had
not
reversed
for
evidentiary
insufficiency?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
that
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
a
reviewing
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
talking
about
the
second
alternative
that
they
took.
are
they
not
open
to
at
least
the
arguable
suggestion
that
they
were
sitting
as
a
jury?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
can
assume
we're
all
familiar
with
the
facts,
counsel.
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
to
accept
what
the
court
said
that
it
did?
you're
not
asking
us
to
reweigh
the
question
and
say
that
the
florida
court
did
something
else,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
were
asking
us
to
say
that
if
a
conviction
is
set
aside
because
it's
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
that
we
should
apply
double
jeopardy
to
it.
but
what
i
think
i
hear
you
saying
is
that
we
should
re-examine
this
whole
question
for
the
florida
court
to
say
they
did
something
other
than
what
they
said
they
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
in
the
case
where
the
trial
court
simply
sets
aside
the
verdict
and
grants
a
new
trial,
sitting
as
a
so-called
thirteenth
juror?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
within
a
system
of
state
procedure
certainly
the
appellate
court
can
decide
it
will
sit
as
a
thirteenth
juror
too,
can't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying,
counsel,
that
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did
is
to
hold
that
the
trial
judge
should
not
have
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beller,
may
i
ask,
justice
boyd
in
the
first
go-around
was
the
crucial
vote,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
in
the
second
go-around
in
his
dissent
he
took
the
position
clearly...
or
i'm
asking
whether
he
did...
that
his
vote
was
on
insufficiency.
unknown
speaker
so
it
gets
down
to
what
the
three
of
the
plurality
of
the
first
go-around
held.
unknown
speaker
but
as
justice
o'connor
said,
in
the
second
go-around
the
majority
said
otherwise.
and
is
this
like,
as
is
so
often
the
case
here,
we
are
confronted
with
a
later
congress'
expression
of
what
it
earlier
meant?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
florida
supreme
court
certainly
messed
it
up
in
a
way,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beller,
what
i
meant
by
my
last
remark
is
that
they
messed
it
up
for
us
in
considering
the
double
jeopardy
feature.
and
i'm
sure
they
feel
they
did
the
right
thing
as
far
as
their
procedure
is
concerned.
it
makes
it
a
ticklish
case
for
you
and
your
client
and
your
opposition.
mr.
beller,
when
a
court
gives
a
new
trial
to
a
defendant
because
the
conviction
is
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
isn't
the
court
merely
granting
the
defendant
a
second
opportunity
to
get
an
acquittal?
and
if
your
rule
were
adopted,
if
double
jeopardy
has
to
apply,
wouldn't
you
preclude
state
court
judges
from,
in
the
interest
of
justice,
giving
a
defendant
that
kind
of
an
opportunity?
unknown
speaker
suppose
an
appellate
court,
suppose
the
florida
supreme
court,
reversed,
simply
citing
the
rule,
mentioning
nothing
about
the
evidence,
that
they're
granting
a
new
trial
in
the
interest
of
justice
under
the
rule,
nothing
more.
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
there
was
and
the
court
denied
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
might,
if
they
merely
cited
the
rule,
they
might
be
doing
it
for
an
accumulation
of
trial
errors
which
they've
elected
not
to
identify.
unknown
speaker
in
the
first
opinion.
unknown
speaker
but
is
the
first
opinion
of
any
significance
now?
isn't
that
vacated
and
the
second
opinion
is
the
only
one
we
deal
with?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
beller,
isn't
that
logical
to
believe
that
it's
true,
where
you
have
a
situation
where
the
evidence
in
the
case
consisted
of
the
testimony
of
the
eyewitness
victim,
hardly
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law?
isn't
it
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
didn't
believe
her?
reading
the
cold
record,
we
just
don't
believe
her.
we're
going
to
weigh
it
differently.
but
that
isn't
insufficient
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
not
everybody
agreed
with
it.
not
everybody
on
the
court
agreed
with
your
analysis.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
supposing
the
law
of
florida
had
been
perfectly
clear
that
at
the
time
prior
to
this
decision
that
the
only
action
an
appellate
court
could
take
would
be
to
reverse
for
insufficiency,
and
some
of
the
judges
of
your
court
say
that
was
what
the
law
was.
and
say
it's
also
perfectly
clear
that
after
this
decision
that's
the
only
action
the
court
can
take,
and
they
hold
that
in
this
one
case
we'll
do
everything
differently.
would
that
be
permissible?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
some
of
the
dissenting
judges
say
occurred.
unknown
speaker
aren't
they
usually?
unknown
speaker
aren't
they
usually?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
my
question
was,
assuming
they
correctly
summarized
the
law
and
you
agreed
with
it,
before
this
decision
and
after
this
decision,
would
it
be
constitutionally
permissible
to
have
this
case
be
decided
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
whereas
all
other
cases
like
it
have
been
decided
on
sufficiency
grounds?
unknown
speaker
how
long
under
florida
law
do
you
think
that
that
could
keep
on
going?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
goes
back
and
he's
tried
again
and
the
12
jurors
find
him
guilty,
he
goes
up
to
the
reviewing
court
and
they
say,
we
still
have
these
doubts.
can
they
send
it
back
again?
unknown
speaker
how
long?
my
question
is,
how
long
can
that
go
on?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
there
is
no
verdict.
that's
quite
a
different
situation.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
been
no
determination
at
all.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it's
a
hung
jury
because
the
thirteenth
juror
is
holding
out?
unknown
speaker
where
did
tibbs
get
the
right
to
prove
his
innocence?
unknown
speaker
that
was
your
phrase.
i
never
knew
we
required
anybody
to
prove
their
innocence.
i
thought
that
was
the
napoleonic
code.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
average
citizen
is
required
to
have
a
jury
to
declare
him
innocent.
i
thought
he
was
presumed
a
little
bit.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he's
presumed
to
be
innocent,
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
prove
his
innocence.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
opinion
in
the
first
case
by
the
supreme
court
is
vacated
totally,
or
is
it
merely
modified?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
was
a
judgment
issued
after
the
first
one,
if
you
know?
unknown
speaker
in
florida
once
a
judgment's
issued
can
it
be
recalled?
unknown
speaker
the
same
court?
once
a
judgment
is
issued,
the
same
court
can
reverse
that
judgment?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
in
the
same
case.
they
didn't
say
that.
this
is
the
exact
same
case.
i
thought
judgment
was
final.
our
constitution
allows
us
to
hear
only
appeals
from
final
judgments.
so
if
the
florida
court
in
the
first
case
issued
a
final
judgments,
"final"
in
quotes,
double
underscored,
can
the
same
court
reverse
that
final
judgment
in
that
case?
that's
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
so
the
judgment
was
not
reversed.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
had
stopped
there
we
might
have
a
different
case,
would
we
not?
unknown
speaker
did
his
cellmate
explain
what
happened
to
the
truck?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beller,
suppose
when
the
case...
did
you
argue
the
case
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
during
the
argument
the
court
said,
we
have
concluded
there's
enough
evidence
to
affirm
the
conviction,
but
we
think
maybe
in
the
interest
of
justice
we
would
grant
a
new
trial
if
you
want
one.
but
if
you
don't
want
one,
why,
we'll
just
affirm
the
conviction.
could
the
state
put
that
to
you,
fairly
put
that
to
you,
without
violating
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
suppose
you
took
it.
and
then
you
think
you
should
win
a
motion,
then,
in
trial
court
based
on
double
jeopardy
grounds?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
during
that
appeal
they
had
said
that.
you
think
that
if
you'd
have
taken
the
new
trial
that
in
the
trial
court
you
could
have
moved
successfully
to
dismiss
the
case
on
double
jeopardy
grounds?
certainly
under
greene
and
burks,
because
subsequent
to
that
appeal,
that
particular
decision,
this
court
said,
you
don't
waive
your
right
to
a
new
trial
if
the
court
reverses
on
evidentiary
matters.
i
would
also
state
that
the
test
is
in
scott.
the
test...
the
scott
test
is
a
very
good
test,
and
that
wasn't--
