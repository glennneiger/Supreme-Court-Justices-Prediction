mr.
michael
a.
palecki
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
here
did
not
misstate
the
issue.
clearly,
the
appellate
court
in
the
instant
case
did
act
as
a
thirteenth
juror.
in
the
second
tibbs
case,
the
court
stated
in
effect
that
it
did
act
as
a
thirteenth
juror.
the
court
stated
that
their
previous
opinion
reversing
and
remanding
for
a
new
trial
was
based
upon
evidentiary
weight.
the
court
stated
that
the
trial
testimony
was
legally
sufficient
to
support
tibbs'
conviction
under
florida
law.
the
court
stated,
we
reweighed
the
evidence
supporting
tibbs'
conviction.
and
finally,
the
court
stated,
"we
cannot
fairly
conclude
that
tibbs'
convictions
were
reversed
on
the
grounds
of
evidentiary
insufficiency.
"
clearly,
this
is
what
is
meant
by
an
appellate
court
sitting
as
a
thirteenth
juror.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
that's
correct,
but
that
is
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
majority
of
the
opinion
of
the
court,
which
is
now
the
law
in
the
state
of
florida.
and
the
petitioner
here
is
merely
asking
this
court
to--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--that
would
be
permissible,
your
honor.
however,
that's
not
what
occurred
here,
first
of
all.
and
secondly,
when
you're
talking--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--that's
true.
that
is
what
the
dissenting
judges
say
occurred.
but
the
dissenting
judges
are
in
the
minority
in
this
case.
now
first
of
all,
to
answer
your
question--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--excuse
me?
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
yes,
they
are.
[laughter]
my
point
is
that
the
dissenting...
the
opinion
of
the
dissenting
judges
is
not
the
law
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
well,
one
thing
i
think
throughout
the
country
i
would
say
pretty
much
universally...
perhaps
there
are
some
exceptions...
the
courts
throughout
the
country
for
the
last
century
have
been
saying
appellate
courts
should
not
reweigh
the
evidence.
and
we
learned
this
in
law
school.
you
know,
it's
one
of
the
elementary
principals
of
appellate
law.
yet,
time
and
time
again
appellate
courts
do
reweigh
the
evidence.
it's
a
matter
of
fact.
i
have
read
dissenting
opinions
of
this
court
where
the
dissent
says
the
majority
here
reweighs
the
evidence.
i
believe
also
this
court
has
written
majority
opinions
saying
that
the
dissent
is
reweighing
the
evidence.
so
we
have
an
area
of
law
which
it
appears
that
very
often
courts
try
to
dodge
or
evade,
and
courts
are
continuously
reweighing
the
evidence,
even
though
they
say
that
they
aren't.
but
in
any
event,
the
law
in
the
state
of
florida
in
this
particular
case
perhaps
is
not
clear
that
the
courts
can't
reweigh
the
evidence.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
opinion
of
the
second
district
court
of
appeal,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
where
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
cites
at
least
ten
cases
in
the
state
of
florida
where
appellate
courts
had
reweighed
the
evidence.
so
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
a
bulk
of
caselaw
in
florida
which
has
the
effect
of
saying
that
in
florida
the
appellate
courts
up
until
that
time
can
reweigh
the
evidence.
now,
in
this
case
not
only
did
the
florida
supreme
court
rule
that
tibbs'
reversal
was
not
based
upon
evidentiary
insufficiency;
the
court
ruled
that
it
had
improperly
reweighed
the
evidence
and
described
tibbs'
reversal
as
an
appellate
reversal
improperly
entered.
so
the
florida
supreme
court
has
conceded
that
it
reweighed
the
evidence
and
has
described
its
earlier
decision
as
an
appellate
reversal
improperly
entered.
and
the
court
went
on
to
state:
"we
could
simply
apply
the
principles
enunciated
in
today's
decision,
vacate
our
previous
reversal,
and
affirm
tibbs'
conviction.
"
so
not
only
was
tibbs'
reversal
not
an
acquittal
here;
it
should
not
even
have
been
a
reversal,
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
here
retrial
doer
not
give
the
state
a
second
choice...
excuse
me...
a
second
chance
to
supply
evidence
that
it
failed
to
muster
in
the
first
trial.
here
retrial
gives
the
defendant
a
second
chance
to
convince
the
jury
of
his
innocence.
in
this
court--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
yes,
your
honor,
they
can.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
well,
i
would
answer
that
question
by
referring
the
court
to
its
caselaw
on
hung
juries.
this
court
has
written
several
opinions
which
say
when
there
is
a
hung
jury
there
can
be
a
retrial.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
that's
true,
your
honor,
there
is
no
verdict.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
but
in
this
regard
the
hung,
jury
case
is
closer
to
one
terminating
in
an
acquittal
than
the
case
where
the
appellate
court
reverses,
despite
the
technical
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
it's
very
analogous
to
a
hung
jury,
because
the
appellate
court
as
a
thirteenth
juror
is
merely
saying,
we
disagree
with
the
other
twelve
jurors.
so
in
that
case,
in
that
way,
it
is
very
analogous
to
a
hung
jury.
but
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
situation
of
a
hung
jury
is
even
closer
to
an
acquittal
than
in
the
case
where
an
appellate
court
reverses
despite
the
technical
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
because
after
a
hung
jury
the
prosecutor
knows
his
case
has
not
led
to
a
conviction,
whereas
in
the
case
here
the
prosecutor
knows
that
his
case
has
led
to
a
conviction
and
that
the
twelve
jurors
have
believed
the
defendant
tibbs
was
guilty.
i
would
cite
this
court...
excuse
me.
i
would
argue
that
in
this
situation
it
is
tibbs
who
gets
the
proverbial
second
bite
at
the
apple
and
not
the
state
of
florida,
because
tibbs
gets
to
go
in
front
of
a
jury
again
and
perhaps
tibbs
can
be
acquitted
the
second
time.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
well--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--well,
your
honor,
that
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
perhaps
i
should
have
used
the
word
that
tibbs
will
be
found
innocent
by
the...
found
innocent
by
the
jury
in
his
second
trial,
not
that
he'll
have
to
prove
his
innocence.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
well,
at
this
time
he
is
presumed
innocent,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
has
reversed
his
conviction
and
said
that
tibbs
starts
off
on
a
clean
slate.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
he
does
not
have
to
prove
his
innocence.
in
upholding
the
massachusetts
dual
tier
trial
system,
this
court
held
that
nothing
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
a
state
from
affording
a
defendant
two
opportunities
to
avoid
conviction
and
secure
an
acquittal.
and
that's
merely
what
i'm
saying
in
this
case.
under
burks,
the
defendant
will
go
free
only
when
the
prosecution's
failure
is
clear.
petitioner
requests
a
drastic
broadening
of
burks
to
cover
the
situation
where
not
only
isn't
failure
clear,
but
where
there
is
no
failure
at
all,
because
here
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
that
its
reversal
was
improperly
entered,
that
they
made
a
mistake
and
they
should
never
even
have
reversed
it
in
the
first
place.
so
in
this
case
there
has
been
no
failure
at
all,
and
to
extend
burks
to
a
situation
where
there
has
been
no
failure
at
all
is
completely
uncalled
for.
now,
this--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--well,
they
state
that
we
could
simply
apply
the
principles
enunciated
in
today's
decision,
vacate
our
previous
reversal,
and
affirm
tibbs'
conviction,
but
they
chose
not
to
do
so.
they
felt
that
tibbs
would
be
prejudiced
by
doing
so
because
they've
already
told
tibbs
he
can
have
another
trial
and
they're
going
to
let
him
have
the
second
trial.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
yes,
your
honor.
a
judgment
was
entered.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
i
think
the
appellate
law
in
florida
is
similar
to
other
states,
in
that
once
a
judgment
is
entered
the
appellate
court
can
reverse
the
previous
conviction
and
remand,
if
necessary,
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
well,
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
would
prohibit
that,
your
honor.
and
as
far
as
florida
law
is
concerned,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
in
effect
done
that,
although
this
was
an
appellate
decision
and
not
a
judgment.
i
think
there's
a
distinction
between
an
appellate
decision
and
a
judgment.
here
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
its
previous
appellate
decision
was
wrong.
just
i
would
say
it's
similar
to
the
burks
case,
where
this
court
has
said
that
bryant
is
no
longer
the
law
in
this
state.
i
think
that
an
appellate
court--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--well,
in
this
case
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
reverse
its
previous
judgment.
it
merely
said
that
it's
reasoning
in
reaching
the
previous
judgment
was
incorrect
and
that
it
should
not
have
done
that.
but
they've
pretty
much
stuck
with
their
judgment
that--
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
redetermine
a
matter
of
state
law.
in
this
case
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
that
it
reweighed
the
decision,
its
previous...
it
reweighed
the
testimony
in
its
previous
decision,
and
that
this
was
not
a
case
that
was
overturned
based
on
evidentiary
insufficiency.
the
case
of
pell
v.
maryland
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
will
not
redetermine
matters
of
state
law.
here
evidence...
the
evidence
was
sufficient
under
jackson
v.
virginia.
that
is,
in
viewing
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution,
a
rational
tryer
of
fact
could
have
found
guilt
here.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
they
had
stopped
there
we
wouldn't
have
any
of
the
problems
that
we
have
right
here,
because
the
facts
are
very
clear
that
cynthia
nadeau
on
two
occasions
specifically
identified
mr.
tibbs
in
the
courtroom,
pointed
to
him
and
said,
that
is
the
man
that
raped
me,
he
is
the
man
that
murdered
terry
milroy.
she
testified
that
tibbs
shot
milroy
in
the
back,
that
he
then
went
over
to
milroy,
who
was
pleading
for
his
life,
pleading,
don't
shoot
me
again,
and
said
to
milroy,
does
it
hurt,
boy,
are
you
in
pain?
finally,
after
he
was
done
taunting
milroy
he
dispatched
him
with
a
single
bullet
to
the
head.
thereafter,
he
went
on
to
rape
cynthia
nadeau.
there
was
the
testimony
of
the
doctor
that
she
did
have
sperm
in
her
vagina.
there
was
the
corroborating
testimony
of
tibbs'
jailmate,
who
testified
that
tibbs
had
told
him
he
committed
the
36
murder
and
went
into
some
detail,
stated
that
he,
tibbs,
had
told
him
that
he
was
driving
down
the
road
in
fort
myer
when
he
saw
a
couple
hitchhiking,
and
he
mentioned
the
name
of
the
road,
cleveland
or
fowler.
tibbs
told
his
cellmate
that
he,
on
the
pretense
of
running
out
of
gas,
he
went
out
into
a
field
where
there
was
some
farm
machinery,
presumably
to
siphon
gas
out
of
it.
tibbs'
cellmate
said
that
tibbs
had
offered
the
fellow
money
if
he
walked
off;
that
tibbs
told
him
that
he
pulled
out
his
gun
and
told
the
dude
to
start
running;
that
tibbs
told
him
that
he
shot
the
dude
that
was
running;
that
tibbs
said
that
he
had
sex
with
the
girl
and
walked
over
and
shot
the
dude
again;
that
tibbs
said
he
was
fixing
to
kill
the
girl,
but
she
swayed
him
not
to
by
telling
him
she
would
be
his
woman;
and
finally,
that
the
girl
jumped
out
of
the
truck
and
that
a
car
was
coming
at
that
time,
so
he
had
to
get
going.
so
in
detail
tibbs'
cellmate
gave
the
story
of
the
crime,
and
it
corroborates
on
many
points
with
the
testimony
of
ms.
nadeau.
mr.
michael
a.
palecki
he
testified
that
tibbs
had
told
him
that
the
truck
had
run
out
of
gas
between
fort
myers
and,
i
don't
remember
if
it
was
miami
or
fort
lauderdale,
but
on
the
east
coast
of
florida.
the
truck
was
never
able
to
be
found,
although
certainly
that's
not
fatally
deficient
under
the
test
of
jackson
v.
virginia.
it's
very
clear
that
under
jackson
v.
virginia
that
there
was
a
sufficient
evidence
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
found
guilt.
and
under
jackson
v.
virginia
we
must
view
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution.
if
there
is
any
question
at
all
that
the
florida
supreme
court
didn't
act
in
good
faith
here,
that
their
second
opinion
was
merely
a
ruse
used
in
order
to
get
by
burks,
i
think
it's
clear
that
that's
not
the
case,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
in
a
similar
case,
mcarthur
v.
nourse,
just
some
weeks
before
this
case
had
ruled
that
burks
applied.
because
in
that
case
they
said
they
had
based
their
opinion
upon
insufficiency.
so
the
florida
supreme
court...
there's
no
showing
that
the
florida
supreme
court
used
its
second
opinion
as
a
means
of
somehow
evading
the
burks
opinion.
as
the
florida
supreme
court
stated
in
its
second
opinion,
prior
to
burks
there
was
no
reason
whatsoever
to
be
precise
in
your
language
concerning
evidentiary
insufficiency,
because
burks
broke
with
a
long
line
of
precedent
reaching
all
the
way
back
to
1896,
united
states
versus
ball.
so
there
was
no
reason
for
the
florida
supreme
court
to
believe
in
the
first
case
that
this
question
would
ever
arise.
and
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
the
florida
supreme
court
coming
back
with
a
second
opinion
saying,
this
is
what
we
meant,
and
being
precise
with
our
language
here
now
that
we
know
what
burks
is
the
law,
this
is
what
we
meant
when
we
came
out
with
our
first
opinion.
now,
the
petitioner
incorrectly
analyzes
united
states
v.
scott
in
his
brief,
and
comes
up
with
a
nice
neat
test,
that
there
are
two
categories:
one
is
reversals
based
on
fact,
which
means
there
must
be
an
acquittal;
and
the
other
is
reversals
based
on
trial
error,
under
which
case
there
cannot
be
an
acquittal.
but
the
petitioner
fails
to
recognize
the
distinction
between
a
dismissal
at
trial
and
a
reversal
on
appeal.
at
trial
where
there's
a
dismissal
you're
taking
the
case
away
from
a
jury
which
might
well
find
the
defendant
not
guilty,
whereas
on
appeal
we
know
that
the
jury
has
found
the
defendant
guilty.
in
this
case
the
12
jurors
said
tibbs
is
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
rape,
and
for
that
reason
there
are...
the
test
in
scott
is
not
the
same
test
used
in
burks,
because
the
test
in
scott
does
not
work
on
an
appellate
reversal,
because
every
appellate
reversal
based
upon
facts
isn't
necessarily
an
acquittal.
in
burks
this
court
said
that
an
acquittal
after
the
court
reversed
must
mean
that
the
evidence
should
never
even
have
gone
to
the
jury.
the
appellate
court
in
this
case,
in
the
first
burks
case,
never
said
or
even
hinted
that
the
evidence
should
not
have
gone
to
the
jury.
the
never
said
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
not
granting
an
acquittal.
so
for
these
reasons,
the
nice
neat
package
we
have
in
scott,
where
we
have
two
categories...
reversal
based
upon
facts
and
reversal
based
upon
trial
error...
does
not
work
on
an
appeal
situation.
on
an
appeal
situation
we
must
have
two
different
categories.
we
have...
and
this
is,
i
think,
supported
by
burks...
those
categories
are
reversals
based
upon
evidentiary
insufficiency
and
every
other
ground
for
reversal.
on
reversals
based
upon
evidentiary
insufficiency,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
and
the
state
cannot
retry
the
defendant.
on
every
other
ground
for
reversal
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply
and
the
state
can
retry
the
defendant.
thank
you.
