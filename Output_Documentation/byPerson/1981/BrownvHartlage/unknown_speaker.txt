unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg?
unknown
speaker
do
you
interpret
these
cases
in
the
law
of
kentucky
to
provide
then
that
the
statute
forbids
only
campaign
promises
to
perform
illegal
acts?
unknown
speaker
promising
to
do
an
illegal
act.
unknown
speaker
yes.
do
you
take
the
position
that
what
was
stated
by
the
candidates
in
this
case
was
something
that
was
not
capable
of
legal
accomplishment
then?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg,
do
you
think
that
under
kentucky
law
a
campaign
promise
to
try
to
cut
government
expenditures
and
reduce
taxes
would
be
legal
or
illegal?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
situation,
counsel,
if
he
carefully
phrased
his
remarks
to
say
if
elected
i
will
advocate
a
program
of
reduction
of
salaries
generally?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
your
candidate
is
speaking
before
a
group
of
little
league
people
and
says
a
elected
i'm
going
to
promise
to
get
$5,000
for
the
little
league
that
they
don't
presently
have
coming
out
of
the
county
treasury.
now,
i
take
it
that
would
violate
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
say
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
a
sense
taxpayers
are
a
select
group,
too,
aren't
they?
all
of
the
people
in
the
electorate
are
not
necessarily
taxpayers.
unknown
speaker
but
your
client
did
ascertain,
and
apparently
as
a
result
of
his
retraction
felt
that
he
may
well
have
crossed
the
line
at
any
rate
and--
unknown
speaker
--and
made
the
retraction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg,
does
the
state
have
to
show
that
each
such
election
promise
constitutes
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
electoral
integrity,
or
is
it
enough,
do
you
think,
that
the
state
simply
shows
that
the
promises
as
a
class
tend
to
mislead
the
electorate?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chauvin.
unknown
speaker
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
seems
to
say
that
no
candidate
shall
promise
to
vote
for
or
support
any
individual,
thing
or
measure.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
under
kentucky
law
a
candidate
couldn't
promise
to
support
some
particular
proposal
for
legislative
action?
unknown
speaker
has
any
kentucky
case
affirmatively
stated
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
or
do
we
rely
only
on
the
two
older
cases
that
were
cited?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
had
promised
here
to
refund
the
amount,
$3,000,
to
the
state
treasury?
unknown
speaker
well,
give
it
to
the
state
now.
i'm
talking
about
giving
it
back.
the
state
treasury
would
benefit.
it
would
be
the
same.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
pretty
thin
line,
don't
you...
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
so
that
your
statute
goes
to
the
impossible
as
well
as
to
the
illegal.
unknown
speaker
there
are
those
who
say
that
president
reagan's
promise
to
balance
the
budget
is
impossible.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
your
kentucky
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
of
course,
none
of
your
decisions
have
come
right
out
and
said
that
this
statute
is
limited
to
barring
promises
to
do
something
that's
illegal
or
that
are
impossible.
you
extrapolate
that
from
the
two
old
cases,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
the
statute
would
purport
to
forbid
a
candidate
from
promising
to
support
a
reduction
in
taxes
or
i
will
support
a
measure
limiting
the
real
property
taxes,
or
i
will
support
a
measure
to
increase
state
aid
to
local
schools,
and
he's
speaking
to
a
group
of
local
school
boards.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
statute
purported
to
prevent
that,
that
certainly
is
literally
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
the
whole
statute
then
would
be
overbroad.
unknown
speaker
in
a
state
court
maybe
it
wouldn't
but--
unknown
speaker
--how
about
the
overbreadth
argument
under
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
overbreadth
argument
is
a
first
amendment
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
if
you
take
that
construction
of
the
statute,
why,
that's
another
matter.
so
we
have
to
make
up
our
mind
whether
the
kentucky
courts
have
construed
the
statute
and
put
some
limits
to
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
how
much
does
that
cost
in
jefferson
county?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chauvin,
you've
gone
a
little
past
my
point,
but
is
there
any
law
in
kentucky
that
says
you
must
take
your
salary?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
if
i'm
an
officer
of
kentucky
i
can't
just
take
the
check
and
throw
it
away?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
i
promise
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
illegal.
unknown
speaker
you
said
it's
not
illegal.
unknown
speaker
pardon?
unknown
speaker
you
could
promise
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
promise
to
take
the
check
and
throw
it
in
the
wastecan,
am
i
not
serving
for
nothing?
unknown
speaker
pretty
close?
that's
about
even,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
not
some
of
this
colloquy
suggest
that,
using
the
language
out
of
the
connally
case
that
men
of
common
intelligence
must
necessarily
guess
at
its
meaning,
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
does
that
have
something
to
do
with
its
vagueness?
unknown
speaker
this
illegal,
did
you
know
there's
considerable
controversy
whether
the
extension
of
the
time
within
which
to
ratify
the
equal
rights
amendment
is
legal
or
not.
indeed,
a
court
said
it
is
not.
could
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
in
kentucky...
i
don't
know
whether
kentucky
has
ratified
or
not...
suppose
not,
could
he
run
and
promise
that
if
elected
he'd
vote
to
ratify
the
era?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
he
have
to
guess
whether
the
extension
was
legal
or
illegal?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
narrow?
unknown
speaker
was
this
during
the
extended
period?
unknown
speaker
counsel?
unknown
speaker
you've
stated
that
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
under
kentucky
law
to
receive
the
salary
and
then
give
it
away.
wasn't
that
precisely
the
question
before
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
in
boggs:
the
people
who
ran
there
promised
to
give
it
to
the
little
league
and
religious
purposes?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
received
it,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
that
would
meet
that
objection.
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
kentucky
court
say
that
in
bogg?
it
said
you
couldn't
receive
money
and
give
it
away?
unknown
speaker
the
salary
had
been
set
but--
unknown
speaker
--so
that's
the
distinction.
if
a
salary's
been
set,
you
can
give
it
away.
unknown
speaker
so
you
not
only
can't
receive
it,
but
you
can't
give
it
away
if
the
salary
has
been
set.
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
still
saying
that
in
some
circumstances
a
candidate
may
give
his
entire
salary
away?
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
come
from
kentucky.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
kind
of
from
a
different
angle?
is
it
rather
clear
on
this
record
that
this
person
could
not
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime
because
he
didn't
realize
at
the
time
that
his
statement
was
inaccurate.
and
in
a
way
he
loses
the
election
because
of
the
inaccuracy,
an
unintended
inaccuracy
in
his
statement.
would
it
be
appropriate
to
judge
the
first
amendment
question
by
the
new
york
times
standard
of
when
he
did
not
know
it
was
unlawful
or
inaccurate
and
was
not
in
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth,
it's
somehow
wrong
to
punish
him
for
an
innocent
falsehood.
unknown
speaker
there's
always
an
interested
candidate
on
the
other--
unknown
speaker
--pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
it's
almost
as
though
he
had
slandered
his
opponent.
that's
really
what
gave
me
the
thought,
that
there's
really
quite
an
analogy
to
a
libel
or
slander
case
because
the
one
person
who's
hurt
by
this
innocent
false
statement
is
his
opposing
candidate.
and
if
this
were
treated
as
slander
under
your
law,
it
clearly
would
not
be
permissible
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
law.
and
is
it
not
correct
that
really
the
heart
of
the
wrong
here
is
the
inaccuracy
in
the
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he
didn't
realize
it
at
the
at
the
time,
and
as
soon
as
he
did
he
made
a
public
disclaimer
of
any--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
whether
the
retraction
was
effective
or
not,
the
record
is
clear
that
he
did
not
intentionally
mislead
or--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
that's
a
fair--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
it
was
a
retraction,
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
been
a
class
a-1
retraction,
you
still
would
be
making
your
same
argument.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
a
retraction
would
correct
this.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
a
little
overbroad,
a
little,
just
a
little?
unknown
speaker
pardon?
unknown
speaker
going
back
to
this
matter
i
raised
before,
i
have
i
think
correctly
observed
that
in
each
argument,
your
friend's
argument
and
yours,
you
each,
with
respect
to
questions,
changed
your...
after
reflection
changed
your
response.
now,
i
don't
suggest
that
as
a
criticism
because
at
that
lectern
i
have
changed
my
responses
to
the
court
at
times,
sometimes
change
my
mind
here;
but
going
back
to
this
matter
of
the
standard,
whether
men
of
reasonable...
and
they'd
better
change
that...
men
and
women
of
common
intelligence
must
necessarily
guess
at
the
meaning,
doesn't
this
colloquy
and
the
matter
of
changing
responses
suggest
that
no
reasonable
person
would
know
whether
he
or
she
was
in
violation
of
this
kentucky
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chauvin.
unknown
speaker
would
a
promise
by
a
candidate
to
vote
for
a
reduction
in
taxes
pro
tanto
be
an
illegal
promise
under
the
kentucky
statute?
unknown
speaker
no.
just
a
blanket
promise
that
if
elected
i
will
vote
for
a
pro
tanto
reduction
in
taxes.
unknown
speaker
why
then
does
the
kentucky
court
rely
on
that
in
its
opinions
as
a
justification
for
holding
it
invalid?
unknown
speaker
because
if
that
would
not
be
invalid,
then
i
wonder
whether
the
kentucky
courts
have
limited
the
application
of
the
statute
as
you
have
suggested.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chauvin,
may
i
ask
another
question?
this
is
limited,
as
i
understand
it,
to
campaign
promises
that
are
legally
impossible
to
perform.
normally
in
the
free
speech
area
we
rely
somewhat
on
the
free
market
idea
that
you
combat
falsehood
by
allowing
the
countervailing
statement
to
be
made
and
considered.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
would
be
the
easiest
sort
of
misstatement
to
refute.
why
can't
the
opponent
simply
say
my
opponent's
promise
is
legally
impossible
to
perform;
this
demonstrates
he's
not
qualified
for
office;
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
remedy
instead
of
saying
he
can't
even
make
the
statement
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
the
voters
in
kentucky
are
not
capable
of
evaluating
these
competing
arguments?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
question
whether
the
man
knows
the
duties
of
the
office
sufficiently
well
to
make
reckless
promises
that
are
legally
impossible
to
perform
is
something
that
ought
to
be
relevant
in
the
context.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
suggesting
that
pointing
it
out
isn't
enough
because
the
public
might
be
deceived
by
it.
unknown
speaker
and
an
addition,
they're
not
worried
about
any
place
but
louisville,
so
all
the
other
voters
are
smart,
but
the
louisville
ones
are
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
other
one
that
can
come
up.
jefferson
county's
the
only
one.
unknown
speaker
on
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
get
in
trouble
if
you
try
to
enforce
a
rule
that
every
politician
must
tell
nothing
but
the
truth?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
yet
to
hear
a
politician
who
doesn't
say
i
will
do
two
things;
i
will
cut
taxes,
and
i
will
raise
expenditures.
well,
that
certainly
is
impossible.
