mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
before
the
court
this
morning
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky.
the
issues
raised
involve
issues
of
first
amendment
rights
of
political
speech,
and
specifically
whether
this
speech
has
been
infracted
by
kentucky
revised
statute,
which
i
may
refer
to
as
krs,
121055.
the
court
will
find
that
in
the
statutory
appendix
to
the
brief
on
the
merits
at
page
11.
that
statute
has
been
interpreted,
in
our
opinion,
in
such
manner
as
to
encroach
upon
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
the
specific
issues
before
the
court
this
morning
will
be
vagueness
and
overbreadth,
will
be
the
creation
of
artificial
distinctions
based
on
content
or
speaker,
and
the
threshold
issue
of
clear
and
present
danger
and
whether
that
doctrine
was
applied
by
the
courts
of
kentucky
appropriately
in
this
case
or
at
all
indeed.
as
applied
in
the
facts
at
bar,
this
case
or
this
statute
would
prohibit
a
candidate
from
promising
in
an
election
campaign
the
pro
tanto
reduction
of
taxes.
generally
speaking,
the
proceedings
below
were
that
the
trial
court
found
that
the
statute
had
been
violated,
but
on
interesting
findings
which
i
will
discuss
with
the
court
in
a
minute
found
that
the
election
should
not
be
voided.
to
the
contrary,
he
found
that
the
petitioner
here
was
fairly
elected.
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky,
and
it
found
a
violation
of
the
statute
as
interpreted
and
found
that
the
statute
should
be
strictly
applied
and
the
election
voided.
on
a
petition
for
rehearing
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky...
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
is
now
our
intermediate
appellate
court.
at
some
points
the
cases
will
have
come
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky,
and
at
another
point
the
case
will
come
from
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky.
i'll
attempt
to
distinguish
the
two
as
we
move
through.
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
petition
for
rehearing
then
reconsidered,
found
that
the
statute
was
still
violated,
but
on
the
other
hand
expressed
some
reservation
in
regard
to
the
constitutionality
and
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute,
and
nonetheless
overruled
the
lower
court.
a
petition
was
then
filed
or
motion
for
discretionary
review
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
our
now
highest
appellate
court,
and
that
was
summarily
overruled.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
we're
here
on
the
following
facts.
carl
brown,
the
petitioner
in
this
matter,
sought
the
office
of
county
commissioner
of
jefferson
county,
kentucky.
jefferson
county,
kentucky
contains
the
only
city
of
the
first
class
in
kentucky,
and
in
that
regard
in
the
joint
appendix
you
will
find
some
statutes
that
refers
to
city
of
the
first
class.
that
is
only
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
if
the
court
will.
but
in
any
event,
carl
brown
sought
a
seat
on
the
fiscal
court,
which
is
our
legislative
body
which
along
with
the
county
judge
executive
forms
the
executive
branch
of
government
of
the
county,
although
it
has
legislative
functions
as
well,
pass
ordinances,
et
cetera.
this
was
in
the
election
of
1979.
brown
and
a
dr.
bill
creech
were
running
mates
on
a
joint
platform
as
the
republican
candidates
and
ran
against
the
respondent,
earl
hartlage,
as
the
democratic
incumbent.
now,
the
petitioner
and
creech
campaigned
on
issues
of
governmental
economy
and
the
usual
issues
that
one
would
expect
of
an
election
of
that
nature.
specifically,
they
zeroed
in
on
some
of
hartlage's
spending
and
primarily
in
at
least
one
press
release
that
is
available
to
you-all
commented
very
unfavorably
in
regard
to
the
salary
which
mr.
hartlage
had
voted
himself
since
he
had
been
in
office.
in
all
events
the
election
heated,
and
by
august
15th,
1979
creech
and
brown
issued
a
joint
press
release.
that
may
be
found
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
2.
and
in
that
statement
they
attacked
the
frivolity
of
spending
of
hartlage
and
almost
in
a
manner
as
i
perceive
the
statement
and
as
it
appears,
almost
in
a
manner
of
put
up
or
shut
up
vein
said
to
prove
the
strength
of
our
convictions,
we
will
reduce
our
salaries
by
the
sum
of
$3,000
a
year
each.
the
statement
was
made,
and
within
the
next
day
or
two
a
friend
of
brown's
contacted
him
and
advised
him
that
it
may
be
arguable
whether
there
was
some
problem
legally
with
that
statement
or
with
that
comment.
brown's
a
young
lawyer,
and
he
went
to
his
office
and
indeed
did
some
research
and
found
that
certainly
someone
had
articulated
an
arguable
question
under
the
law
of
kentucky,
that
there
were
some
kentucky
cases
that
may
look
like
they
make
that
an
illegal
promise,
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
his
election
could
have
been
voided.
in
all
events
on
monday,
i
believe,
but
the
19th
day
of
august
1979,
four
days
after
the
comment
was
made,
brown
and
creech
in
a
joint
press
conference,
which
received
the
same
publicity
and
the
same
coverage
as
the
original
statement,
retracted
that
statement.
they
acknowledged
that
the
statement
was
perhaps
arguably
in
error.
they
retracted
the
promise,
said
that
they
would
not
abide
by
the
concept
of
that
reduction.
now,
the
election
was
held
on
november
the
6th,
1979,
78
days
after
the
retraction.
there
had
been
no
retreat
from
the
retraction
from
the
time
it
was
made
until
the
time
of
the
election.
the
results
of
the
election,
of
the
177,501
ballots
cast,
brown
received
approximately
53
percent
of
the
vote.
he
beat
hartlage
by
10,151
ballots.
and
dr.
creech
was
defeated.
he
was
not
elected,
though
having
made
the
same
commitment
as
brown
had
made
or
the
same
promise.
seasonably,
an
election
contest
was
filed
in
early
december
of
1979.
an
answer
was
appropriately
filed
and
issues
joined.
in
that
answer
the
fifth
affirmative
defense
raises
the
constitutional
issues
before
this
court.
they
have
consistently
been
argued
and
raised
from
the
trial
court
through
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court.
pardon
me,
please.
the
matter
was
tried
in
a
bench
trial
on
january
29th
and
30th,
1980,
and
the
evidence,
among
the
rest
of
the
evidence
appears
a
stipulation
by
the
petitioner
and
by
the
respondent
that
the
retraction
received
as
broad
a
coverage
publicity-wise
as
the
original
statement.
the
trial
court
then
rendered
its
decision
and
found
that
there
was
a
technical,
if
you
will...
and
that's
my
own
characterization...
a
technical
violation
of
krs
121055,
the
statute
which
prohibited
the
promise
to
the
electorate,
but
that
the
election
was
fair.
and
the
trial
judge
found
as
a
fact
in
his
determination
of
the
fairness
of
the
election,
he
found
five
elements.
he
found
that
there
was
an
almost
immediate
retraction.
he
found
that
there
was
no
retreat
from
the
retraction
from
the
day
it
was
made
to
the
day
of
the
election,
and
commented
even
though
mr.
brown
had
been
challenged
by
mr.
hartlage
at
some
political
conclave,
brown
remained
adamant
in
his
retraction
and
did
not
deviate
from
that.
the
judge
balanced
the
disenfranchisement
of
thousands
of
voters,
as
he
put
it,
and
the
presumption
of
the
will
of
the
people
and
creech's
defeat,
and
found
that
the
election
was
fair
and
that
brown
should
receive
his
office.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
in
its
original
opinion
rendered
august
the
8th,
1980
followed
an
old
decision
in
kentucky
that
harks
back
to
1960,
sparks
against
boggs.
and
it
may
be
appropriate
for
me
to
digress
for
a
moment
and
advise
the
court
as
to
the
ramifications
of
sparks
against
boggs
and
a
prior
opinion
that
harks
to
1925,
owsley
against
hill.
these
two
cases,
in
my
judgment,
are
probably
interpretive
of
some
phases
of
the
statute
and
require
some
comment.
in
the
owsley
matter
the
county
attorney
offered
to
serve
for
a
salary
of
$400
less
than
the
previous
attorney
had
received.
his
salary
had
not
been
sent
by
the
county
commissioner.
his
election
was
challenged.
he
won,
and
his
election
was
challenged.
in
any
event,
upon
challenge
the
then
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky...
and
it
was
our
highest
court
in
1925...
held
that
the
reduction
of
salary
was
a
legal
possibility
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
it
had
not
been
set,
and
also
said
in
its
opinion
that
a
promise
that
is
made
to
the
entire
electorate
is
not
a
bribe
and
not
to
be
conceived
as
a
bribe,
but
it
differentiated
that
from
a
promise
made
to
a
smaller
group
of
the
electorate.
in
that
case
then
it
was
held
that
the
county
attorney
would
be
seated.
in
1960
in
the
matter
of
sparks
against
boggs,
which
itself
was
the
election
of
a
group
of
city
commissioners
of
the
city
of
hazard,
kentucky
who
ran
as
platform.
the
salary
in
that
instance
had
been
previously
set
by
statute
at
$500
each
per
year.
the
commissioners
promised
as
a
plank
of
their
platform
that
they
would
forego
all
but
a
dollar
of
that
sum
and
contribute
it
to
various
charitable,
some
civic,
little
league,
and
organizations
of
that
sort.
it
was
not
a
commitment
to
the
entire
electorate
but
to
a
select
group
in
the
electorate.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
in
that
case
distinguished
owsley...
again,
that
was
our
highest
court
at
the
time...
distinguished
owsley
and
in
effect
said
that
the
promise
to
serve
for
less
was
a
bribe
and
as
such
should
be
barred.
now,
in
that
light
we
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
in
the
carl
brown
case,
the
case
before
you
this
morning,
in
the
carl
brown
case
held
that
brown
could
not
legally
do
the
act,
he
could
not
legally
reduce
his
salary;
and
in
that
regard
there
was
no
exception
in
the
statute
for
a
retraction;
in
that
regard
that
the
other
considerations
of
the
trial
court
were
inapplicable
and
not
to
be
considered;
and
that
the
statement
was
not
constitutionally
protected
under
the
aegis
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
on
the--
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
justice
o'connor,
i
perceive...
yes.
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
yes.
however,
the
problem
will
arise
in
a
moment
in
my
argument
as
to
how
in
the
world
we
determine
what's
illegal
or
legal.
but
i
perceive
that
interpretively
speaking
the
statute
prohibits
illegal
acts--
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
--i
promise
to
do
an
illegal
act,
or
perhaps
better
stated,
if
i
may,
an
act
incapable
of
legal
accomplishment.
there
is
some
nuance
of
difference
that's
sort
of
fuzzy
in
my
mind,
i
must
tell
you;
but
i
think
that's
what
it
says.
now,
in
that
regard
then...
i'm
sorry.
did
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
i
do
not
necessarily
take
that
position,
but
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
take
that
position
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
now,
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
rendered
on
october
29th,
1980,
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
perceived
that
the
petitioner's
position
was
not
without
logic
or
appeal,
but
suggested
that
if
you
want
the
relief
that
you
request
of
us,
we
perceive
your
argument
to
be
that
one
of
overbreadth
on
a
federal
constitutional
basis.
but
if
you
want
that
relief,
go
to
the
court
of
appeals...
supreme
court
of
kentucky
and
they
are
the
court
that
can
grant
you
the
relief
that
you
seek.
it
would
be
judicial
anarchy
for
us
to
overrule
sparks
against
boggs.
now,
on
that
state
of
facts
obviously
we
petitioned
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
and
we
were
summarily
turned
down.
this
court
has
granted
us
the
writ.
now,
at
the
outset
of
argument
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
i
concede
that
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
an
interest
in
the
electoral
process.
it
would
be
foolish
for
me
to
say
otherwise.
however,
i
argue
and
urge
that
that
is
not
an
uninhibited
interest,
that
is
not
uninhibited
as
to
political
speech
particularly,
but
that
that
interest
must
be
balanced
against
the
intrusions
on
the
first
amendment
right.
i
don't
think
that
your
amicus
or
i
disagree
that
this
was
political
speech.
the
problem
that
we
disagree
on
is
where
the
interpreted
statute
impacts
the
rights
of
carl
brown
and
where
it
crosses
the
bounds
of
propriety
circumscribed
around
the
first
amendment
by
this
court.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
i'm
inclined
that
the
promise
to
cut
taxes
would
be
illegal,
and
that's
part
of
the
vagueness
argument,
justice
o'connor;
and
it
runs
something
like
this.
if
we
posit
that
the
owsley
and
sparks
decision
prohibit
the
making
of
a
promise
that
would
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
public
and
it
is
incapable
of
being
legally
performed,
i'd
suggest
to
you
that
a
candidate
any
office...
in
the
senate,
in
the
legislature,
or
in
executive
branch
of
government...
couldn't
make
that
promise.
the
vagueness
is
inherent
in
the
that
no
single
member
of
any
body
of
government
without
the
cooperation
of
a
majority
of
his
house
or
a
majority
of
his
group
and
without
the
imprimatur
of
the
chief
executive
can
ever
make
such
a
promise.
so
i
have
a
difficult
time
with
that
situation.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
question
or
the
problem
presented
by
the
phrasing
of
the
hypothetical
"if"
prior
may
defeat
the
whole
impact
of
what
i
perceive
the
first
amendment
to
award.
this
is
an
advocacy
situation.
it
is
projected
in
a
political
arena.
i
don't
feel
that
the
first
amendment
or
this
court
has
ever
required
that
a
man
use
the
precision
of
words
in
political
speech
that
would
require
him
to
wonder
should
i
say
this
or
not.
to
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
judgment
would
make
me
awful
antsy
if
i
were
a
candidate,
because
it
would
chill
my
speech.
it
would
remove
my
thought
processes
from
my
head,
and
in
the
last
analysis
the
interchange
of
ideas,
sir,
is
the
fundamental
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
now,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
i
distinguish
that
in
this
way,
sir.
here
we
offer
to
the
electorate
as
a
whole
to
reduce
taxes.
the
little
league
question
is
a
special
interest
group.
i'm
sorry.
i
may
have
given
you
all
erroneous
answer.
it
probably
would
because
it
singles
out
under
owsley...
i'm
sorry,
sir;
i
wasn't
quick
enough
for
the
question.
under
the
owsley
case
in
kentucky
it
is
a
select
group,
and
it
would.
my
answer
to
your
question
would
change,
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
i
would
agree
with
that,
sir.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
in
kentucky
the
presumption
of
the
electorate
and
the
taxpayers,
apparently
from
the
owsley
case
are
one
and
the
same.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
or
to
you,
sir,
that,
for
instance,
a
commitment,
i
shall
aid
the
elderly,
is
a
select
group
in
my
judgment.
there
are
many
select
groups
to
which
politicians
appeal,
and
in
that
regard
that's
the
problem
i
have
with
this
statute
in
terms
of
vagueness.
it
really
doesn't
say
that
you
could
get
out
and
run
a
rip-roaring
political
campaign,
make
legitimate
promises...
i'm
not
advocating
any
promise
that
is
not
usual,
if
you
will,
sir;
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
feel
that
the
inhibitive
factors
of
this
statute
place
a
pall
over
political
speech,
and
that's
where
i
think
that
it's
vague.
there
is
no
means
by
which
a
candidate
of
common
intelligence
in
my
judgment
can
ascertain
exactly
where
do
i
cross
that
line.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
he
felt...
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
yes,
sir.
i
concede
that
point.
it's
evident
in
the
facts.
but
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
he
had
to
go
research,
as
a
young
lawyer,
he
had
to
go
research
that
problem
out.
and
it
is
not
without
debate.
your
amicus
curiae
and
i
both
have
argued
both
sides
of
the
issue
in
this
matter;
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
argument
itself,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
dispositive
of
the
vagueness
of
this
statute;
that
there
is
no
clear
line
of
political
speech
that
carl
brown
could
have
relied
upon.
in
that
regard
then
with
the
no
notice
concept
in
this
statute,
we
have
to
look
at
another
concept
that
these
facts
give
rise
to
and
which
have
been
briefed;
and
that
is
that
in
kentucky
a
county
commissioner
in
a
county
containing
a
city
of
the
first
class
has
a
benchmark
salary
and
he
has
an
escalated
salary
by
what
we
kentuckians
call
the
rubber
dollar
concept
to
make
up
for
the
inflationary
action
on
all
salaries.
the
base
salary
for
a
county
commissioner
in
a
county
containing
a
city
of
the
first
class
is
found
in
krs
6530
sub
6,
and
that
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
and
it
sets
that
benchmark
salary
at
$9,600.
that
is
the
legal
salary,
i
don't
know,
except
that
i
do
know
that
it
is
permissible
in
kentucky,
the
fiscal
court
may...
it's
written
in
the
permissive...
may
escalate
those
salaries
up
to
an
administrative
sum
determined
by
the
state
finance
department.
now,
we
get
to
the
very
interesting
question
in
my
judgment.
carl
brown
offered
to
serve
at
the
time
for
what
amounts
to
$17,000.
the
rubber
dollar
concept
had
been
applied
to
his
situation
or
to
the
office
which
he
sought.
he
in
effect
said
i
will
serve
for
$17,000,
not
the
$20,000
that
mr.
hartlage
is
getting.
does
that
create
a
legal
impediment?
the
legal
salary,
if
we
are
going
to
saddle
brown
with
determining
that
which
is
legal,
then
the
legal
salary
would
have
to
be
brought
down.
the
question
would
then
arise
does
brown
have
a
right
to
give
up
that
which
is
not
part
of
the
legal
salary,
the
$9,600,
or
does
he
have
a
right
to
give
up
his
rubber
dollar
theory
or
his
rubber
dollars.
and
there
is
a
prohibition
in
the
rubber
dollar
statute
that
reads
to
the
effect
that
you
shall
not
change
your
salary
or
you
shouldn't
change
your
salary
during
the
term
in
which
you're
elected.
now,
in
that
regard
then
i
would
suggest
also
that
a
threshold
question
to
the
restraint
on
advocacy
has
to
have
been
announced
by
this
court
long
ago,
and
in
landmark
communications
against
virginia
we
find
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
used.
in
this
instance
and
in
the
matter
at
hand,
brown
retracted
78
days
prior
to
the
election.
he
never
retreated
from
that
retraction.
his
running
mate
who
made
the
same
comment
and
the
same
promise
to
the
electorate
was
defeated.
brown
won
by
a
resounding
number
of
votes.
and
in
this
regard
i
submit
to
this
court
that
there
cannot
possibly
have
been
any
threat
to
the
compelling
interest
of
the
commonwealth
in
regard
to
the
brown
statement.
it
simply
was
not
the
reason
the
electorate
chose
him.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
justice
o'connor,
i
would
suggest
that
i
read
landmark
communication...
and
i'm
not
going
to
presume
to
tell
this
court
how
to
read
it...
but
i
read
it
to
say
that
there
should
be
a
balancing
mechanism
whenever
the
issue
arises.
in
that
regard
it
was
not
used
in
this
instance.
it
was
ignored.
to
the
contrary,
our
court
of
appeals
said
that
a
retraction
and
the
other
items,
which
really
were
a
balancing
mechanism
used
by
the
trial
judge,
are
to
no
avail.
our
statute
stands
as
written,
and
if
you
cross
or
transgress
that
line,
if
those
words
cross
our
lips,
i
would
pose
the
rhetorical
question
that
suppose
i
use
the
word
"not"
or
in
my
response
to
justice
rehnquist
a
moment
ago
i
corrected
myself.
were
justice
rehnquist
operating
under
the
statute
as
i
perceive
it
in
kentucky
now,
it
would
have
been
too
late
for
me
to
correct
myself;
it
had
passed
my
lips.
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time,
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
goldberg
i'll
waive
any
comment,
if
the
court
please.
