brennan,
jr.
i
have
for
announcement
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
no.
80-1285,
brown
versus
hartlage.
it's
a
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky.
petitioner
brown
defeated
respondent,
hartlage
in
the
1979
general
election
in
kentucky
for
the
office
of
jefferson
county
commissioner,
and
respondent
brought
this
action
in
a
state
court
to
have
the
election
declared
void
alleging
that
petitioner
had
violated
the
kentucky
corrupt
practices
act.
the
alleged
violation
consisted
of
a
campaign
speech
by
the
petitioner
in
which
he
promised
that
if
elected,
he'd
lower
his
salary
by
$3,000
a
year.
the
corrupt
practices
act
prohibits
candidates
from
making
any
promise
as
to
action
when
elected,
if
that
promise
is
made
in
consideration
for
a
vote.
and
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
held
that
petitioner's
promise
did
violate
the
corrupt
practices
act
and
rejected
respondent's
--
or
petitioner's
argument
that
it
so
construed
the
act
violated
the
first
amendment.
and
the
court,
therefore,
declared
the
office
vacant
and
ordered
a
new
election.
we
reverse.
it's
of
course
true
that
states
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
their
electoral
processes,
but
when
a
state
seeks
to
uphold
that
interest
by
restricting
speech,
limitations
on
state
authority
imposed
by
the
first
amendment
are
manifestly
implicated.
when
a
state
seeks
to
restrict
directly
as
this
kentucky
act
does,
the
offer
of
ideas
by
a
candidate
to
the
voters,
the
first
amendment
requires
that
the
restriction
be
demonstrably
supported
not
only
by
a
legitimate
state
interest,
but
a
compelling
one,
and
that
the
restriction
operate
without
unnecessarily
circumscribing
protected
expression.
the
kentucky
statute
as
applied
to
petitioner's
promise
violates
the
first
amendment
under
that
analysis.
the
court
of
appeals
analogized
petitioner's
promise
to
a
bribe.
however
too,
that
may
be
as
a
matter
of
kentucky
law,
there's
no
constitutional
basis
upon
which
petitioner's
pledge
to
reduce
his
salary
might
be
equated
with
a
candidate's
promise
to
pay
voters
for
their
support
from
his
own
pocketbook,
like
a
promise
to
lower
taxes,
to
increase
efficiency
in
government,
or
indeed,
to
increase
taxes
to
provide
some
group
with
a
desired
public
service,
petitioner's
promise
to
reduce
his
salary
cannot
be
deemed
beyond
the
reach
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
or
considered
as
inviting
the
kind
of
corrupt
arrangement,
the
appearance
of
which
i
state
may
have
a
compelling
interest
in
avoiding.
there's
no
showing
that
petitioner
made
the
promise
other
than
in
good
faith
and
without
knowledge
of
its
falsity,
or
that
he
made
it
with
reckless
disregard,
whether
it
was
false
or
not.
moreover,
petitioner
retracted
the
promise
promptly
after
discovering
that
it
might
have
violated
the
act.
under
all
the
circumstances,
nullifying
petitioner's
election
victory
was
inconsistent
with
the
atmosphere
of
robust
political
debate
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
concurring
in
the
result.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
judgment.
