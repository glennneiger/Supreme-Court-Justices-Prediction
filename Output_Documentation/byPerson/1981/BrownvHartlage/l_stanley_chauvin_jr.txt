mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
not
particularly
pleasant
to
become
involved
in
an
electoral
dispute.
courts
have
historically
restrained
themselves
from
involvement
unless
there
is
clear,
convincing,
glaring
and
measurable
irregularity
which
cries
out
for
judicial
intervention.
the
sanctity
of
the
freedom
of
voters
choosing
their
new
leaders
or
retaining
incumbents
is
indelibly
etched
in
the
history
of
our
nation.
one
of
the
attractions
of
our
system
of
government
is
the
assurance
of
meaningful,
participatory
and
effective
suffrage.
but
congress
and
state
legislatures
have
set
minimum
standards
for
participating
both
as
candidates
and
as
voters.
education,
experience,
or
social
standing
are
not
legitimate
criteria.
with
some
obvious
exceptions
such
as
years
of
admission
to
the
bar
before
seeking
a
judgeship,
legislative
bodies
and
constitutions
have
required
no
greater
qualification
for
those
who
seek
election
than
for
those
who
vote
for
them.
normally
a
length
of
residency
requirement
for
state
candidates
but
not
even
this
for
federal.
age
is
usually
a
requirement.
so
who
may
seek
office
and
who
may
hold
office
is
proscribed
and
encumbered
minimally.
as
sure
as
restraint
has
been
shown,
response
has
been
the
key
when
the
process
has
been
corrupted
or
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
corruption.
it
took
a
lot
of
years
and
effort
to
remove
the
government
itself
as
a
corrupting
factor
when
citizens
otherwise
qualified
were
excluded
strictly
because
of
race
from
the
electoral
process
by
outright
abuse
and
government
legislation.
this
court
through
its
intercession
and
interpretation
removed
this
cancer.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
minimal
requirements
are
the
only
ones,
and
artificial,
unreasonable,
unscrupulous
or
unconscionable
barriers
will
not
be
tolerated.
the
court
has
promptly
responded
to
criminal
acts
which
corrupt
the
process.
bribing
voters
always,
both
state
and
federal,
has
been
forbidden.
as
an
aside,
just
as
paying
for
votes
is
prescribed,
likewise
paying
to
vote
by
the
means
of
a
poll
tax
has
been
extinguished.
it
would
trifle
with
this
court
to
review
further
the
strong
interest,
both
legislatively
and
judicially,
which
has
been
shown
to
forbid
outright,
overt,
and
damnably
cruel
acts
to
tamper
with
the
electoral
process.
another
area,
and
difficult
to
administer,
has
been
the
regulating
of
acts
which
are
neither
constitutionally
repulsive
nor
criminally
measurable.
it
is
with
such
an
act
the
case
at
bar
is
concerned.
the
purity,
honesty
and
fairness
of
the
electoral
process
are
compelling
state
interests.
it
is
not
difficult
to
recognize
and
punish
bribery,
but
criminal
acts
such
as
bribery
are
not
the
only
method
of
corrupting
the
process.
it
is
easy
and
required
to
define
a
criminal
act.
it
is,
however,
not
so
easy
to
define
non-criminal
corrupting
acts
if
their
existence
is
known
and
the
putrefaction
is
recognized.
in
an
attempt
to
keep
pure
the
electoral
process
in
kentucky
the
constitution
in
1895
set
certain
standards...
this
is
in
the
constitution...
set
certain
standards
to
be
addressed
by
legislation.
the
statutes
as
enacted,
interpreted
and
applied
apply
even-handed
regulation.
the
criminal
is
obvious
and
addressed
by
the
indictment
process.
other,
non-criminal
matters
are
regulated
by
administrative
agencies
who
monitor,
not
direct,
conduct,
compile
information,
and
take
steps
to
correct
both
civil
and
criminal
violation.
this
is
the
state
at
work.
this
is
state
action
directly
involved
in
the
electoral
process.
it
directs
reports
to
be
filed,
grants
authorities
to
agencies,
sets
spending
limits,
requires
listing
of
contributors,
creates
codes
of
conduct,
holds
hearings,
assesses
fines
and
penalties,
initiates
both
civil
and
criminal
action,
issues
guidelines
and
directives
seeking
the
voiding
of
elections
and
other
similar
acts.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
under
kentucky
law
it's
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
a
candidate
can
promise
to
do
or
not
do
anything
which
is
not
illegal
or
constitutionally
forbidden.
in
this
case--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
the
original
case
where
the
salary
had
not
been
set,
that's
the
key
to
this
case.
the
statute
provides
for
the
setting
of
the
salary
in
may
of
the
election
year.
the
statute
and
the
constitution
of
kentucky
say
that
a
salary
may
not
be
scaled
up
or
scaled
down
during
the
term.
after
may
of
the
year
of
the
election
it
is
after
that
impossible
and
impermissible
and
constitutionally
not
permitted
in
kentucky
to
change
the
salary;
and
that's
the
distinction.
does
that
answer
it?
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
that
is
a
practice
for
some
people,
to
accept
the
funds
and
then
give
it
away.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
problem
with
him
giving
it
back.
i
think
it
was
the
promise
to
not
accept
it.
the
treasurer
of
jefferson
county,
kentucky
was
compelled
to
cut
a
check.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
well,
the
line
is
not
as
thin
as
it
sounds
because
there
are
acts
which
can
be
performed
and
those
which
can't
be
performed.
this
was
an
act
which
could
not
be
performed
under
kentucky
law.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
he
said
he'd
give
it
his
best
shot,
and
at
that
time
the
budget
was
not
set.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
says
in
may
of
the
election
year
the
budget
is
set,
so
he
would
not
have
crossed
the
line.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
said
it
by
implication,
i
think,
when
they
talk
about
the
salary
has
been
set,
and
the
constitution
says
it
can't
be
changed.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
first
amendment.
that's
fully
protected.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
it
would
go
too
far.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
the
whole
statute
rises
or
falls
on
this.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
the
problem
being
that--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--there's
probably
more
merit
to
the
overbreadth
argument
than
to
the
first
amendment
restraint.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
where
the
overbreadth
argument
is...
the
threshold
is
the
promising
of
an
act
impossible
of
legal
fulfillment.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
it
has
another
value...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
it
has
another
value
in
that
the
penalty
for
the
violation
of
this
statute
deserves
some
attention.
it
merely
requires
the
rerunning
of
the
election.
this
is
a
statute--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--it
could
be
expensive,
but
the
purity
of
the
electoral
process
is
worth
something.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
statute...
i
would
say,
mr.
justice,
there
is
no--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--well,
you
could
do
that
or
you
could
contribute
it
to
a
charity.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
because--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--it--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--it's
not
illegal.
you
could
promise
that.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
you
could
promise
that.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
but
you
could
not
promise
to
serve
for
nothing.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
pretty
close.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
but
you
did
not
violate
the
statute.
it
is
possible
for
you
to
do
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
vagueness
potential,
but
it
has
the
same
as
the
434(e)
of
the
election
act
of
1971
when
this
court
had
a
problem
over
who
was
required
to
report.
the
statute
merely
said
all
of
those
who
spend
money
on
behalf
of
a
candidate
shall
report
it.
in
434(e)
there
was
a
great
problem
for
vagueness,
but
the
court
looked
at
the
overall
purpose
of
the
statute
and
interpreted
the
two
classes
required
to
report
and
narrowed
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
to
answer
your
first
question,
kentucky's
done
it
both
ways,
passed
it
and
repeated
it.
but
i
think
that
there
is--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it
would
reach
him.
i
think
we're
talking
about
something
much
narrower
here.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
narrow
to
the
point
that
if
it
is
a
constitutional
infirmative
or
impossibility
in
kentucky,
then
that's
the
line.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
constitutionally
impossible
in
kentucky.
in
fact,
it
happened
that
it
was
passed
and
then
the
approval
was
set
aside.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
the
issue
would
be
whether
or
not
it
had
been
set
at
that
point.
i
think
that
was
it
in
that
case.
they
were
making
pronouncements
of
what
they
would
do
with
it
before
they
got
it.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
the
disposition
of
funds
is
a
right
for
anybody
to
do
with
as
he
or
she
chooses.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
the
kentucky
court
said
i
believe
in
that
case,
mr.
justice,
that
the
salary
had
already
been
set.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
that
was
a
violation
of
it.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
happens.
the
present
governor
gives
his
salary
away.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
it
presents
a
situation
that
injects
into
the
political
process
the
opportunity
for
someone
to
say
i
will
serve
for
nothing;
and
they
ask
the
other
candidate
will
you
serve
for
nothing,
and
he
says
no,
i
can't
serve
for
nothing;
i
need
the
money.
the
implication
is
there
that
candidate
2
isn't
as
interested
in
the
job
as
candidate
1
because
he
just
wants
the
money.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
at
one
time
senator
kerr
and
senator
green
used
to
distribute
their
salary
among
their
staffs.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
i
say
that
practice
is
familiar,
to
give
it
to
an
assistant
or
give
it
to
someone
else.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
would
say
that
if
the
statute...
that
is
a
valid
distinction
with
this
concern.
this
particular
statute
which
is
before
the
court
reserves
to
a
candidate
the
right
to
bring
this
action,
and
if
a
candidate
made--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--but
not
the
state.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
not
the
state.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
the
inaccuracy
and
the
impossibility
of
the
performance.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
had
problems...
i
wasn't
in
the
case
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
had
problems
with
this
being
called
a
retraction.
if
you
read
that
second
statement,
i'm
not
sure
at
all
that
that
was
a
retraction.
i
pointed
that
out
in
my
brief.
it
was
a
restatement,
but
no
one
could
object
to
the
second
because
there
was
nothing
in
it
other
than
to
say
i...
32--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
sir?
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
would
not
be--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--sir?
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
wouldn't
be.
the
problem
that
bothers
me--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--the
state
statute
does
not
give
retraction
as
a
defense,
just
as
in
arnett
v.
kennedy,
the
case
where
the
non-probationary
federal
employee
could
be
fired
"for
the
good
of
the
service.
"
and
the
person
who
did
the
firing
could
sit
as
a
hearing
officer.
and
this
court
said
that
it
might
well
have
been
better
if
congress
had
done
it
some
other
way,
but
the
fact
is
it
didn't.
and
since
it
didn't,
it
was
a
matter
which
addressed
itself
to
congressional
correction.
this
statute
could
perhaps
be
more
tolerable
if
the
defenses
which
were
available
of
retraction
and
not
retreating
from
it,
those
five
reasons
the
trial
judge
gave,
if
the
legislature
of
kentucky
were
to
make
these
defenses
in
this
type
action.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
got
a
shot
at
it.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
the
overbreadth
question
has
concerned
me
as
i
did
this
brief
more
than
the
first
amendment,
because
i
think
the
first
amendment,
there's
no
question
under
given
circumstances
such
as
these
that
the
first
amendment
would
be
regulating.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
could
include
legal
as
well
as
illegal
and
thus
chill
the
statement.
that's
the
question.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
a
valid
observation
on
many
statutes,
this
one
not
the
least
of
which.
but
what
malice
aforethought,
wanton
reckless
disregard.
the
problem
of
this,
as
i
have
viewed
this
case,
the
problem
of
this
case
is
that
there
are,
as
the
court
said
in
arnett
v.
kennedy,
limitations
on
what
you
can
do
to
define
acts
in
a
statute.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
this
morning
in
all
candor
and
all
honesty
that
not
only
the
english
language
but
spanish,
german,
french,
italian,
chinese,
japanese
and
korean
together
are
incapable
of
describing
the
possible
acts
of
an
election
in
kentucky.
it
just
can't
be
done,
to
make
a
list
of
the
possible
violations
which
people
can
come
up
with.
and
the
highest
court
of
kentucky
has
limited
and
given
candidates
all
the
rights
in
the
world...
and
i
subscribe
to
it
in
my
brief
and
this
morning...
to
a
full,
free,
rancorous,
acrimonious
debate,
limited
only,
however,
to
acts
which
are
legally
impossible
to
perform.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
if
the
rate
had
not
been
set,
the
candidate
could
well
do
that.
the
violation
in
this
case
is
that
in
august
when
this
statement
was
made,
the
action
which
forbade
it
had
already
taken
place.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
ma'am,
that's
not
a
violation.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
read
that
in
the
case,
but
i
did
not
think
of
that
as
an
overriding
reason
the
kentucky
court...
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
reasons,
but
not
the
overriding
reason
that
that
case
held
that.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
in
the
first
case
the
petition
was
dismissed,
the
highest
court
saying
there's
nothing
wrong
with
what
the
candidate
said
because
the
salary
hadn't
been
set.
it
was
not
an
impossibility.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
think
the
voters
are
entitled
to
more
protection
than
that.
i
would
say
that
with
all
respect
to
the--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--well,
in
some
places
the
salary
is
not
the
great
attraction
to
the
office.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i
think
that
that
could
be
pointed
out,
but
i
think
also
that--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--i
think
that
tends
to
corrupt
the--
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
--no.
this
is
the
first
one
that
has
come
up
in
louisville.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
but
i
say
that
cases
have
come
up
from
other
counties
around
the
state.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
on
this
same
statute,
yes.
the
candidates
from
up
in
northern
kentucky
who
said
they'd
pool
the
salary
and
hire
a
city
manager.
they
said
you
can't
do
that.
there's
no
provision
in
the
law
for
a
city
manager,
and
besides
that,
you
can't
pull
your
salaries.
that
was
up
in
northern
kentucky.
over
in
eastern
kentucky
the
tax
assessor
said...
he'd
been
tax
assessor
before
and
said
when
i
was
tax
assessor
before
you
didn't
pay
taxes
on
certain
things.
remember
that
when
you
vote
for
me
this
time.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
at
that
time
said
no,
you
can
only
exempt
from
taxation
matters
which
the
constitution
allows
you
to
exempt,
and
it's
impossible
for
you
to
do
this.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
i'd
say
you
sure
had
a
big
field
out
there
to
work
on.
it's
the
impossibility,
though,
that
makes
it
an
interest,
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
l.
stanley
chauvin,
jr.
hopeful--
but
i
think
this
matter
can
be
corrected,
if
it
deserves
correction,
by
the
legislature
of
kentucky.
the
whole
problem
with
this
case
was
that
defenses
available
in
one
statute
were
not
available
in
this
one.
it
might
have
been
better
often
if
congress
or
state
legislatures
had
done
things
differently.
in
this
case
it
didn't
happen.
this
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
to
protect
this
compelling
interest
in
which
the
commonwealth
of
ketucky
has
an
important
and
measurable
interest,
and
it
can
be
and
should
be,
if
necessary,
corrected
by
legislation.
i
would
be
the
last
to
limit
anyone's
first
amendment
rights.
i
do
not
think
this
statute
as
applied
and
narrowed
by
the
courts
of
kentucky
puts
any
chill
or
any
untold
or
untoward
effect
on
any
candidate
in
kentucky.
it's
seldom
you
can
deal
with
a
statute
that
says
you
can
do
everything
but
one.
that's
basically
what
these
cases
have
said,
that
nothing
is
proscribed
except
that
which
is
illegal
and
constitutionally
impossible.
i
think
that
it
is
and
would
urge
the
court,
as
the
lower
courts
have,
that
this
is
a
valid
assertion
by
the
state
legislature
of
the
interest
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
and
its
electoral
process.
this
was
not
a
statute
which
was
hastily
contrived
to
defeat
some
purpose
that
the
legislature
found
distasteful.
the
legislature
passed
this
act
almost
word
for
word
because
the
constitution
commanded
it
to
do
it;
and
it
is
with
that
compelling
purpose,
that
weighty,
important
reason,
that
the
kentucky
court
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
