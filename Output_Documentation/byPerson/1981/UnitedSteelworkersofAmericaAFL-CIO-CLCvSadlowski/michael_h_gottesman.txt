mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
1978
convention
of
the
steelworkers
union...
that
is
its
highest
governing
body,
including
several
thousand
delegates
selected
by
the
members
of
each
of
its
locals...
the
constitution
of
the
union
was
amended
by
adopting
the
rule
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
that
rule
forbids
candidates
and
their
supporters...
candidates
for
office
within
the
union,
for
high
office
within
the
union...
from
soliciting
or
accepting
campaign
support
from
persons
who
are
not
members
of
the
union.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
to
assure
that
those
who
got
elected
to
high
office
in
the
union
would
be
beholden
only
to
the
members
of
the
union,
and
not,
by
virtue
of
the
financial
benefits
they
had
received
from
outsiders,
be
beholden
to
those
outsiders.
the
analogue
in
the
federal
statutes
and
with
respect
to
federal
elections
to
the
rule
that
the
steelworkers
adopted
is
that
provision
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
candidate
for
federal
office
to
solicit,
accept
or
receive
any
contribution
from
a
foreign
national.
the
court
below
has
held
that
the
steelworkers
rule
violates
section
101(a)(2)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
a
part
of
title
i
of
that
statute.
we
sought
review,
and
this
court
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
two
questions:
first,
whether
that
construction
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
is
correct;
and
second,
if
it
is,
whether
the
landrum-griffin
act
as
thus
construed
to
deprive
the
union
and
its
members
of
the
right
to
insulate
their
elections
from
outsider
involvement,
abridges
the
first
amendment
freedom
of
association
of
the
union's
members,
by
taking
from
them
the
power
to
determine
the
appropriate
standard
of
participation
by
others
in
its
elections.
i
will
talk
first
about
the
statutory
construction
issue.
whenever,
as
here,
the
question
is
the
legitimacy
of
a
union's
election
rule,
statutory
analysis
properly
begins...
though,
of
course,
it
doesn't
end...
with
title
iv
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
title,
entitled
elections,
which
lays
down
election
rules
with
respect
to
union
elections.
in
that
title,
congress
prescribed
a
number
of
rules
to
govern
union
elections,
frequency
of
elections,
notice
of
elections
and
the
like.
and
one
of
the
subjects
that
congress
specifically
focused
on
in
title
iv
was
the
subject
of
campaign
financing.
in
title
iv,
congress
expressly
provided
that
union
monies
and
employer
monies
could
not
be
donated
to
any
candidate
in
a
union
election.
and
in
title
iv,
congress
expressly
provided
that
every
member
of
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
provide
campaign
support
to
a
candidate
in
a
union
election.
now,
of
course,
there
is
a
middle
ground
between
that
which
congress
expressly
forbad
and
that
which
congress
expressly
protected.
there
are
non-members
of
the
union
whose
capacity
to
contribute
is
not
addressed
on
the
face
of
title
iv.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
title
iv
has
no
relevance
to
that
question,
because
congress
in
title
iv,
having
laid
down
and
mandated
for
unions
certain
rules
that
they
had
to
comply
with
in
their
elections,
closed
the
circle;
it
didn't
stop
with
it.
it
said,
beyond
the
rules
that
we
prescribe
in
this
title,
unions
will
be
free
to
choose
their
own
election
rules.
we
have
laid
down
certain
minimum
requirements,
and
beyond
this
we
expressly
provide
that
the
choice
as
to
any
other
election
rules,
not
inconsistent
with
those
that
we,
the
congress,
have
laid
down,
rests
with
the
members
of
the
union
through
their
democratic
processes.
that
decision
is
reflected
in
two
difference
places
in
title
iv.
first,
in
section
403
which
provides
that
no
labor
organization
shall
be
required
by
law
to
conduct
election
of
officers
in
any
different
former
manner
than
is
required
by
its
own
constitution
and
bylaws,
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
this
title.
and
it
is
provided
again
in
section
401(e)
which
is
one
of
the
provisions
that
lays
down
the
rules
unions
must
obey.
and
one
of
those
rules
is
that
the
election
shall
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
such
organization,
insofar
as
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
title.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
union's
rule.
it
would
not,
your
honor.
the
rule
has
an
express
exception
for
volunteered
personal
services,
so
that
a
non-member
of
the
union
is
free
to
donate
his
or
her
personal
time
to
supporting
a
candidate
in
a
union
election.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
we
have
the
same
distinction
here,
your
honor,
that
you
have
in
the
federal
sector
between
expenditures
and
contributions.
if
they
took
these
contributions
from
others,
who
presumably
are
not
members
of
the
union,
and
didn't
give
them
to
a
candidate,
or
didn't
spend
them
in
cooperation
with
a
candidate,
the
steelworkers
rule
would
not
implicated
because
they--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--if
they
get
the
money
from
non-members
and
then
give
it
to
a
candidate,
or
spend
it
with
his
cooperation,
they
would
violate
the
rule.
if
they
got
money
from
non-members
in
order
to
finance
activities
of
their
own,
independent
of
the
candidate
although
expressing
their
support
for
him,
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
union's
rule.
in
that
sense,
the
distinction
between
expenditure
and
contribution
in
the
union's
rule
is
parallel
to
that
in
the
federal
statutes.
and
indeed,
it
is
i
think
fairly
obvious
when
you
look
at
the
union
rule
and
the
way
it
is
structured
that
those
who
drafted
it
were
not
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
some
of
these
same
questions
had
been
considered
and
addressed
in
the
federal
statute,
and
many
of
the
lines
are
the
same,
including
the
exception
for
volunteered
personal
time.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
was
amended
once
and
that
amendment
is
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
the
amendment
does
not
relate
to
the
issues
that
are
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct.
there
has
not
been
another
union
constitution
since
the
rulings...
union
convention...
since
the
rulings
below.
and
the
next
one
is
scheduled
for
this
september.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
union
rule
does
not
violate
101(a)(2),
it
has
to
address
that
only
because
respondents
have
offered
it
as
an
alternative
basis
for
invalidating
the
entire
rule.
we
did
not
seek
review
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
that
the
rule
violates
that,
because
implicit
in
that,
in
our
view,
would
simply
be
an
injunction
saying
don't
apply
your
rule
to
litigation,
which
is
no
problem
for
the
union
because
we
didn't
think
it
applied
to
litigation
in
the
first
place.
but
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
rule
does
not
violate
101(a)(2),
that
other
provision
comes
into
play
only
in
the
sense
that
respondents
are
here
saying
you
should
use
that
other
provision
to
invalidate
the
whole
rule.
and
therefore,
in
that
sense,
the
court
would
possibly
reach
that
issue
and
have
to
decide
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
briefs
for
respondents
recite...
the
record
doesn't...
that
such
outside
funds
were
contributed
substantially
to
the
election
in
the
mineworkers
union
several
years
ago,
in
which
tony
boyle
was
defeated.
beyond
that,
i
personally
am
not,
and
the
record
does
not
show...
it
certainly
had
been
the
experience
in
the
steelworkers
in
1977.
it
was
george
meany's
statement
at
that
time
that
it
was
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
afl-cio
that
any
of
its
affiliates
had
suffered
an
experience
of
an
organized,
concerted
outsider
involvement
such
as
had
occurred
in
the
1977
steelworker
election.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
have
been,
yes,
three
prior
ones.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
no
one
has
ever
gotten
less
than
40
%
of
the
vote
in
any
presidential
election
in
the
steelworkers.
that
is
a
strange
statistics,
but
unquestionably
a
correct
one.
one
challenger
won
and
defeated
the
incumbent,
so...
and
he
got
51
%
of
the
vote.
the
other
three
all
got
in
a
range
of
40
%
to
43
%.
sadlowski
got
43
%,
the
prior
ones
had
gotten
41
%
and
40
%.
the
statement
that
appears
in
their
briefs
that
he
was
the
first
serious
challenger
to
an
incumbent
is,
therefore,
one
that
comes
with
some
surprise.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
judgment
of
the
union
was
that
it
would
not,
your
honor,
and
the
reasons
are
explained
in
our
reply
brief.
the
problem
with
simply
having
disclosure
and
no
ban
is
that
you
can
counter
exactly
what
happened
in
the
1977
election.
there
was
a
candidate
for
office
in
the
union
who
was,
indeed,
a
very
popular
candidate.
and
who
had
taken
a
lot
of
outside
money,
and
who
wound
up
getting
substantially
less
of
a
vote
than
people
i
think
generally
had
thought
he
would
get.
and
what
happened
was,
the
voters
in
that
union
had
to
make
a
choice:
they
had
to
become
one-issue
voters.
they
had
a
candidate
that
they
would
have
preferred
to
leave
the
union,
but
the
price
for
having
him
was
going
to
be
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
candidate
beholden
to
outsiders.
now,
it
seems
to
me...
and
certainly
it
seemed
to
the
union...
that
it
is
entitled
to
make
the
judgment
that
it
is
not
enough,
either
in
the
way
of
protection
or
in
the
way
of
satisfying
the
members'
interests,
for
people
to
know
that
one
factor
about
a
candidate
is
that
he
is
potentially
beholden
to
outsiders.
because
they
can't
adequately
vindicate
their
concern
about
without
automatically
voting
against
him
on
that
ground.
and
beyond
that,
once
you
have
some
candidates
doing
this,
it
is
inevitable
they
are
all
going
to
do
it,
just
to
equalize
things,
and
then
you
are
going
to
have
a
situation
where
the
voter
has
no
choice
at
all
to
avoid
candidates
beholden
to
outsiders,
because
they
will
be
competing
to
see
who
can
get
more.
and
the
notion
that
incumbents
are
going
to
be
less
successful
at
getting
outsider
money
is,
i
think,
contrary
to
at
least
intuitive
good
sense.
it
was
not
the
case
in
this
election,
but
it
could
well
be
the
case
in
other
union
elections.
now,
the
congressional
scheme--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
your
honor,
it
applies
to
any
union
and
any
officer
of
another
union.
and
the
definition
of
employer,
as
construed
by
the
labor
department
and
enforced
by
the
sixth
circuit,
is
so
broad
that
would
encompass
about
80
%
of
the
people
to
whom
the
union's
rule
is
addressed
anyway.
the
labor
department's
interpretation
is
that
because
the
word
"employer"
is
not
qualified
by
"interested"
employer,
as
it
is
in
a
different
provision
of
the
statute,
it
was
congress'
intent
that
anybody
who
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning...
in
interstate
commerce,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
even
though
he
has
no
involvement
with
this
union,
this
union
does
not
represent
his
employees,
he
doesn't
do
business
with
this
union
in
any
commercial
sense...
anybody
who
meets
the
statutory
definition
of
an
employer
cannot
contribute.
and
that
includes
any
managing
person
cannot
make
personal
contributions.
so
that
a
partner
in
a
law
firm,
a
dentist
who
employs
two
assistants,
the
person
who
owns
the
neighborhood
bar,
all
of
those
people
under
the
labor
department's
regulation
and
the
sixth
circuit
decision
are,
in
any
event,
precluded
from
contributing.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
the
term
employer,
as
i
recall
it,
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
anyone
who
is
an
employer
under
any
other
federal
labor
relations
statute.
so
that
it
picks
up
railway
labor,
national
labor
relations
act,
and
indeed,
many
people
who
aren't
covered
either
because
they
are
too
small
but
are
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
so
it
is
anybody,
in
essence,
who
employs
one
or
more
employees
can't
make
either
an
institutional
or
a
personal
contribution.
and
that
much
is
imposed
by
law.
and
the
sixth
circuit,
the
decision
that
i
referred
to,
is
marshall
versus
local
20.
it
is
611
fed
2d,
645.
the
sixth
circuit
explained,
this
is
what
congress
intended.
it
wanted
these
unions
to
be
for
their
members
and
it
wanted
all
of
these
people.
that
case
involved
a
personal
friend
of
the
candidate
who
employed
two
people;
he
was
a
dentist.
and
the
court
said
that
his
contribution
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
so
that
what
the
union
is
doing
is
filling
a
space
that
congress
in
title
iv
left
open,
but
not
such
a
broad
space
as
perhaps
is
suggested
by
the
briefs
of
the
respondent.
now,
in
that
title
iv
scheme
there
is
clear
evidence
as
to
why
it
is
that
congress
not
only
laid
down
certain
rules
but
also
laid
down
the
additional
provision
that
beyond
these
rules,
the
union
shall
be
free
to
adopt
their
own
and
make
their
own
choices
with
respect
to
election
rules.
and
what
the
legislation
shows
is
that
congress
was
struggling
with
two
objectives.
on
the
one
hand,
the
mcclellan
hearings
had
shown
without
doubt
that
there
were
some
undemocratic
unions,
and
that
there
were,
in
fact,
certain
statutory
necessities
that
were
going
to
be
required
if
those
unions
were
going
to
be
made
democratic
and
put
back
in
the
hands
of
their
union
officers.
and
so,
congress
said
we
are
going
to
lay
down
and
mandate
by
federal
law
those
rules
that
we
have
determined
are
essential
to
the
achievement
of
union
democracy,
and
those
we
have
done
in
title
iv.
but
the
other
congressional
concern
is
that
we
do
not
intrude
too
far
on
union
autonomy.
this
was,
after
all,
the
first
time
that
congress
had
ever
legislated
with
respect
to
internal
union
affairs,
and
the
legislative
reports
are
replete
with
statements...
we
are
dealing
here
with
private
associations.
we,
by
enacting
this
statute,
are
tinkering
with
the
mechanisms
by
which
the
leadership
of
private
associations
are
selected,
and
in
doing
so,
we
want
to
act
as
limitedly
as
we
can.
we
have
defined
certain
evils;
we
will
mandate
the
correction
of
those
evils.
beyond
that
we
will
not
go.
and
more,
beyond
that,
we
will
make
clear
that
the
choice
will
be
for
the
union
members
of
what
their
rules
will
be
beyond
this.
more
than
that,
the
whole
point
of
this
statute
was
to
return
the
governance
of
unions
to
their
members,
so
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
statements...
we
shouldn't
go
too
far
in
legislating
rules
of
the
unions,
not
only
because
we
violate
their
autonomy,
but
because
we
are
unfaithful
to
the
very
purpose
of
this
statute.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
we
will
create
minimum
standards
that
will
be
sufficient
to
give
the
union
back
to
its
members.
and
certainly
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
steelworkers
union
is
in
the
hands
of
its
members.
candidates
for
office
are
defeated
all
the
time,
incumbents
are
removed
at
a
rate
equal
if
not
exceeding
that
in
federal
elections.
and
we
will
let
the
members
make
choices
on
all
the
matters
except
those
that
we
have
specifically
dictated
here.
and
thus,
we
have
in
title
iv
the
closing
of
the
circle.
certain
rules
laid
down
and
a
specific
mandate
that
beyond
that,
the
choice
is
for
the
union
members
and
it
cannot
be
dictated
by
any
provision
outside
of
title
iv.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh,
it
would
clearly--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
well,
what
we
have
got...
i
mean,
the
constitutional
issue
in
any
case
is
this
is...
private
association,
it
has
private
decision-making
mechanisms,--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--at
every
stage
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
government
justification
for
the
intrusion
that
it
is
making
on
the
union
autonomy.
and
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
in
measuring
that
between
a
rule
whose
function
it
is,
and
which
is
directly
aimed
at
providing
the
decisionmaking
in
the
hands
of
the
union's
members;
a
rule
that
says
there
must
be
elections,
a
rule
that
says
there
will
be
notice
of
elections,
a
rule
that
says
you
will
not
prevent
candidates
from
voicing
their
views
or
other
members
from
voicing
their
views.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
certainly
landrum-griffin
says
so,
and
certainly
the
first
amendment
argument
that
that
would
be
an
intrusion
on
freedom
of
association
i
think
would
be
a
much
harder
one
than
the
one
we
have
got
here,
because
there
the
governmental
interest
would
be
stated
and
there
is
a
closer
nexus
between
the
governmental
interest
than
there
is
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
if
a
non-member
of
the
union
wanted
to
support
a
candidate
in
the
steelworkers
election,
and
wanted
to
take
his
money
and
go
out
and
buy
newspaper
space,
wanted
to
go
out
and
spend
money
to
do
various
kinds
of
things
to
advertise
his
views
on
that
subject,
there
is
nothing...
the
union
is
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it,
but
beyond
that,
the
rule
does
not
purport
to
forbid,
as
it
cannot,
a
non-member
from
expending
money
directly,
just
as
under
the
federal
law
he
cannot.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely.
as
long
as
the
limitations
in
the
union's
rules
are
the
same
as
those
in
the
federal
rule.
as
long
as
he
is
acting
independently
of
the
candidate.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
weakens
it
in
the
same
way
and
to
the
same
extent
that
that
same
distinction
was
said
to
be
weakened
in
buckley
by
some
who
thought,
in
dissent,
that
the
court's...
that
the
line
the
court
drew
between
contributions
and
expenditures--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
is
right,
there
is
no
way
the
union
could
stop
outside
expenditures.
the
union
only
has
jurisdiction
over
its
members.
all
it
can
do
is
say
to
its
members
you
will
not
take
money
from
outsiders.
it
cannot
stop
an
outsider
who
wants
to
spend
money
and
not
give
it
to
a
union
member;
it
just
has
not
control,
no
jurisdiction
over
it.
now
turning
to
101(a)(2),
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context,
it
seems
to
us,
of
what
title
iv
has
done.
and
the
question
has
to
be...
because
this
really
is
the
question...
did
congress,
when
it
wrote
this
other
title
of
the
same
statute,
intend
to
overturn
the
very
decision
that
it
made
in
title
iv,
to
leave
all
other
choices
to
the
union
members.
when
you
look
at
it,
the
first
thing,
the
first
right
it
confers
is
the
right
to
meet
and
assemble
freely
with
other
members.
now,
that
is
the
only
place
in
101(a)(2)
where
the
associational
right
is
addressed,
and
it
is
expressly
and
in
terms
confined
to
meeting
with
other
members.
needless
to
say,
that
is
the
not
the
provision
the
court
below
relied
on.
the
court
below
relied
on
the
provision
to
express
any
views,
arguments
or
opinions.
senator
mcclellan
and
the
others
who
proposed
that
explained
the
purpose
of
that
provision.
it
was
to
remedy
what
they
found
to
be
the
case...
that
within
unions
generally,
people
who
spoke
out
in
criticism
of
officers
got...
suffered
reprisals.
they
might
be
beaten
up,
they
might
be
disciplined,
expelled,
fined.
he
said
we
can't
have...
we
need
sanctuary
for
the
union
member.
we
can't
have
all
these...
we
have
all
these
wonderful
structural
titles
in
this
bill
like
title
iv,
but
if
members
are
afraid
to
get
up
and
speak
because
they
are
going
to
be
expelled
if
they
do
so,
those
titles
aren't
going
to
work,
nor
will
any
of
other
objectives
work.
so
we
need
here
something
that
tells
the
union
member
if
you
speak,
if
you
become
a
candidate,
if
you
do
these
things,
you
are
not
going
to
be
punished
for
doing
so.
that
was
the
objective
of
this
provision.
now,
there
is,
to
be
sure,
an
overlap
between
title
iv
and
title
i,
but
it
is
not
a
redundancy.
if
a
member
makes
a
campaign
speech,
to
discipline
him
would
violate
both
titles.
but
in
the
statutory
scheme,
what
title
iv
says
is
that
violation,
the
remedy
will
be
setting
aside
the
election.
what
title
i
says,
and
what
was
added
by
101(a)(2)
is
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
member's
freedom
to
say
that
if
he
gets
thrown
out
of
the
union,
the
election
will
be
set
aside.
we
have
got
to
give
him
personal
protection.
and
that
is
what
101(a)(2)
does.
he
gets
a
personal
remedy,
and
that
was
designed
to
give
him
the
sanctuary
that
would
allow
him
to
be
free
to
enforce
his
rights
and
to
voice
his
views.
now,
that
is
the
only
purpose
stated,
or
the
101(a)(2).
and
the
emphasis
i
think
is
on
the
word
"any".
this
was
a
protection
to
members
who
express
any
views,
even
those
that
are
disapproved
by
the
leadership
of
the
union.
and
it
is
not,
i
think,
legitimate,
given
what
title
iv
expressly
says
about
election
rules,
to
say
that
what
congress
was
doing
over
here
with
those
words
was
creating
a
new
campaign
finance
provision.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
and
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
that
was
congress
intention.
the
sole
argument
on
the
other
side
is
an
analogy
to
the
constitution.
i
do
want
to
reserve
some
of
my
time.
we
have
dealt
extensively
with
that
supposed
analogy
in
our
briefs
and
shown
why
we
think
it
to
be
flawed.
if...
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
it
fails
to
note
that
the
constitutional
analogy
that
is
being
relied
upon
is
one
that
was
first
articulated
by
this
court
17
years
after
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
that
it
is
not
likely
that
congress
could
have
conceived,
even
if
it
was
intending
to
legislate
the
first
amendment,
that
to
do
so
would
have
carried
with
it
those
implications.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
is
a
certain
iron
in
this
case.
we
are
told
that
what
the
union
did
here
is
a
terrible
blow
to
democracy.
but
what
the
union
did
here
is
an
expression
of
democracy.
there
is
no
debate
about
the
fairness
of
the
union's
convention.
delegates
elected
by
the
members
from
all
over
the
country
came,
and
overwhelmingly,
by
a
ten
to
one
margin,
said
we
want
this
rule.
now,
that
is
democracy.
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
stifle
that
democratic
choice,
and
whether
it
constitutionally
can
do
so.
mr.
rauh
has
recited
in
the
last
half
hour
facts
about
union
elections
that
so
diverge
from
the
facts
in
this
record
and
the
facts
about--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
should
have
made
that
clearer,
and
i
had
forgotten
that
provision.
the
union
cannot
stop
outside
expenditure.
the
union
does
want
the
candidate
to
make
such
efforts
as
he
can
take
to
discourage
them,
and
i
apologize
to
your
honor,
because
i--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
but
of
course
he
can't...
those
who
do
want
to
do
it
can
do
it.
the
union
can't
stop
them.
and
i
apologize
for
having
forgotten
that.
it
is
important
i
think
to
remember
the
posture
of
the
case,
and
the
posture
of
this
case
is
that
summary
judgment
was
granted
to
the
respondents.
so
that
while
mr.
rauh
recites
as
fact
that
people
can't
get
money
from
the
members
of
the
union,
and
the
staff
always
supports
the
incumbents,
the
evidence
in
this
record
is
quite
the
contrary.
indeed,
there
is
virtually
nothing
supporting
what
he
is
saying,
but
more
importantly,
there
is
a
great
deal
supporting
the
other
side.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
are...
it
is
not
the
same.
there
are
substantial
affidavits
that
there
are
numerous
people
who
have
unseated
incumbents
in
steelworker
elections
relying
solely
or
almost
solely
on
member
contributions.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
if
we
are
right
that
101(a)(2)
doesn't
create
this
right,
we
also
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
and
of
course,
the
complaint
didn't
allege
101(a)(2),
but
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
have
it
treated
as
amended,
since
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on.
our
position
was
they
don't
state
a
claim
under
the
law.
that
is
our
first
proposition.
and
if
we
are
right
about
that,
dismissal
is
the
proper
disposition.
but
if
we
are
wrong
about
that
and
we
are
down
to
fighting
about
whether
the
facts
are
what
mr.
rauh
says
they
are,
there
is
not
a
fact
he
recited
that
can
be
accepted
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case.
most
of
what
he
said
has
no
record
support;
all
of
what
he
said
is
flatly
contradicted
by
affidavits
that
show,
as
i
say,
that
outsiders
have
defeated
incumbents
relying
on
contributions
within
the
union;
that
show
that
sadlowsky
did
not
make
a
serious
effort
to
raise
money
from
the
union
because
he
did
not
have
to,
he
had
all
the
money
he
wanted
from
outsiders;
that
show
that
the
staff
frequently
supports
the
opponents,
sometimes
unanimously
supports
the
opponents
of
incumbents;
that
shows
that
the
staff
are
really
just
rank
and
filers,
almost
all
of
the
staff
are
people
who
worked
in
the
plant,
worked
their
way
up
to
local
union
positions,
went
on
the
staff.
they
are
members
just
like
everybody
else.
and
they
have
the
same
rights
to
participate
and
they
have
contractual
protection
against
any
harm
being
done
to
them
because
they
support
whoever
they
choose
or
choose
not
to
support.
this
record
shows
that
64
%
of
the
staff
did
not
support
either
candidate,
at
least
financially
in
the
1977
election.
it
also
shows
that
the
union
has
1,300,000
members,
all
of
whom
are
eligible
contributors:
that
other
candidates
have
had
no
trouble
with
in-plant
solicitation.
the
people
who
run
for
top
office
in
the
union...
and
the
record
shows
this...
aren't
some
person
who
doesn't
know
anybody.
they
are
people
who
achieved
some
status,
as
this
court
said
in
buckley,
they
are
incumbents
of
other
offices.
in
that
capacity,
whether
local
union,
whether
staff,
in
those
capacities
they
have
gotten
to
know
throughout
this
union,
they
have
the
mechanism
by
which
they
can
get
fund
raising
within
the
union
going.
the
record
also
contains
evidence
of
elections
under
this
rule
that
successfully
raised
substantial
money
to
oppose
an
incumbent.
