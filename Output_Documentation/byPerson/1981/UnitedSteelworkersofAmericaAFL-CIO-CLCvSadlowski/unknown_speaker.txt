unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
situation,
mr.
gottesman,
if,
let
us
say,
the
wives
of
ten
of
the
employees
of
the
operation,
either
with
or
without
signs,
but
including
signs,
vote
for
one
of
the
candidates
and
they
paraded
up
and
down
outside
the
plant
or
the
operation,
or
merely
stood
there
with
their
signs.
would
that
be
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
if
they
held
out...
something
like
the
salvation
army...
some
plates
and
said
please
contribute,
help
elect...
help
keep
the
union
clean
or
whatever
it
is
they
were
trying
to
do.
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
good
faith
on
the
part
of
these
people,
that
they
want
to
get
support,
voting
support,
they
want
to
get
money
to
generate
further
support,
and
they
want
to
get
it
from
members
of
the
union,
members
of
the
public,
anywhere
they
can
get
it.
do
the
union
rules
inhibit
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
has
section
27
of
the
union
constitution
been
amended
at
all
since
this
action
was
initiated?
unknown
speaker
and
there
have
been
no
further
amendments.
unknown
speaker
and
does
this
court
have
to
address
the
right
to
sue
theory,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
how
common
a
situation
is
this?
are
you
aware
of
any
campaigns
involving
unions
other
than
the
steelworkers
which...
where
outside
funds
played
a
prominent
part?
unknown
speaker
apart
from
this
one,
has
there
been
any
serious
challenge
to
the
incumbency
in
the
steelworkers?
unknown
speaker
with
any
substantial
vote?
unknown
speaker
i
would
assume,
mr.
gottesman,
that
in
evolving
this
rule,
some
consideration
was
given
to
what
has
been
the
usual
pattern
through
the
public
area,
the
public
sector,
of
requiring
sworn
statements
identifying
all
the
contributors.
if
every
candidate
within
the
union
was
required
to
file
a
sworn
statement,
with
every
contribution
identifying
the
contributor
and
forbidding
a
the
process
that
would
preclude
any
anonymous
contributions,
would
that
not
satisfy
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
does
the
prohibition
in
the
landrum-griffin
act
against
contributions
by
employers
or
unions
apply
only
to
the
union
which
is
holding
the
election
and
only
to
an
employer
whose
employees
are
represented
by
the
union?
unknown
speaker
the
term
employer
then
is
defined
independently
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
as
to
whether
they
would
be
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
their--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
the
free
speech
provision
is
constitutional,
in
the
sense
that...
what
if
there
were
a
union
rule
that
would
purport
to
limit
free
speech
beyond
that
which
is
guaranteed
with
a
statute?
do
you
think
that--
unknown
speaker
--why
would
that
be
constitutional
and
this...
i
know
your
bottom
line,
at
least
one
of
your
bottom
lines
is
that
if
construed
this
way,
this
provision
at
issue
here
would
be
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well
why
couldn't
the
union
then
just
limit
free
speech
beyond
that
which
the
statute
purports
to
guarantee?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
union
has
to
hold
elections
rather
than,
say,
appoint
its
officer
by
some
other
method?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
you
referred
to
a
distinction
between
contributions
and
expenditures.
will
you
elaborate
on
that
and
suggest
some
examples
of
the
distinction,
the
way
it
would
operate?
unknown
speaker
in
that
type
of
advertising
or
mail
campaign,
is
it
your
view
that
the
identity
of
the
candidate
could
be
specifically
mentioned,
rather
than--
unknown
speaker
--that
substantially
weakens
the
basic
purpose
of
the
rule
as
you
have
annunciated
it,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
way
the
union
could
stop
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rauh,
if
it
is
old,
what
would
you
think
was
your
strongest
case
before
the
act
was
passed?
it
surprises
me--
unknown
speaker
--well,
those
were
court
opinions.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rauh,
your
argument
is
based
on
an
assumption
that
the
section
incorporates
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
you
why
the
congress
wouldn't
have
used
the
language
of
the
first
amendment
if
that
is
what
they
intended.
they
used
something
different.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rauh,
how
do
you
get
democracy
if
you
get
all
of
your
money
outside,
ten
times
what
everybody
else
has?
would
that
be
democracy?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
for
that,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
affect
free
speech?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
affect
free
speech?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
union
couldn't
decide
it
for
itself?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rauh,
excuse
me,
i
don't
see
a
page
12.
are
we
really
talking
about
the
reply
brief
of
petitioners?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
to
page
10.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
two
yellow
briefs.
it
is
a
little
confusing...
each
of
them
is
labeled
reply
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
find
that
language
on
12
that
you
spoke
of.
unknown
speaker
i
have
got
the
right
brief
now.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
about
disclosure?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
union
rule
had
provided
that
no
candidate
shall
take
more
than
50
%
of
his
money
from
outsiders,
if
it
put
no
ceiling?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
to
my
question,
then,
is
the
union
couldn't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
limitations
on
not
all
outside
sources,
but
selected
sources
like
corporations.
unknown
speaker
but
partnerships,
or?
unknown
speaker
or
political
organizations
that
have
been
formed
for...
to
influence
the
election?
suppose
there
is
a
committee
to
influence
the
steelworkers'
next
election,
and
they
independently
raise
their
money
and
then
give
large
sums
to
the
candidate?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
say
they
couldn't
do
that,
either.
unknown
speaker
does
the
present
law
bar,...
without
this
provision,
does
the
law
bar
raising
any
money
from
corporations?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
any
employer
in
whatever
industry?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
one
other
question
while
you
are
paused,
mr.
rauh.
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
if
a
non-member,
say
a
relative
or
a
friend,
decided
he
wanted
to
support
your
client's
candidacy,
he
could
spend
all
the
money
he
wanted
to
and
there
is
nothing
they
could
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
staff?
and
the
staff
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
they
are
free
to
get
it
from
the
staff.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
a
resident
alien
be
like
a
member
of
the
staff?
that
is,
interested
in
union
affairs,
but
i
understand
staff
members
can't
vote
unless
they
are
members
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
are
they
all
members
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
qualify
as
a
steelworker?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
work
as
a
steelworker--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
you
assume
that
the
election
of
the
union
is
controlled
by
money.
unknown
speaker
all
i
am
trying
to
do
is
try
to
warn
you
that
you
sound
like
it--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
know
you
didn't
mean
it.
a
senator,
for
example,
who
has
a
constituency
that
large,
anything
in
this
record
that
would
indicate
what
the
parallel
problems
would
be?
unknown
speaker
a
million,
three,
did
you
say?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rauh,
you
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
legitimate
basis
for
a
rule
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
is
there
no
union
interest
in
not
having
the
union
leadership
beholden
to
someone
who
collects
large
sums
of
money,
contributed
by
many
small
contributors...
but
a
fund
raiser?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
the
difference--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
just...
what
is
the
difference
between
one
fund
raiser
who
might
have
great
influence,
and
one
very
wealthy
supporter
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
really
directing
my
question
at
the
facts
of
this
particular
election,
but
just
as
a
general
proposition,
can
you
conceive
of
any
situation
in
which
there
would
be
a
legitimate
justification
for
a
rule
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
you
can't
have
one
solicitor
collect
more
than
$1000?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they
finished
the
paragraph
on
page
13
with
the
thought
that
i
was
just
expressing.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
that
purpose
survived
the
opinion
that
former
secretary
wirtz
wrote
that
is
at
454
of
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
like
our
saying
one
of
our
decisions
construing
a
statute
conflicts
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gottesman,
on
that
point,
we
asked
you
about
independent
expenditures,
and
you
gave
me
quite
a
different
impression
than
i
get
from
reading
joint
appendix,
74.
unknown
speaker
it
is
rather
strongly
worded,
his
duty
to
stop
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
talking
about
summary
judgment,
is
there
really
any
evidence
in
the
record...
i
mean,
in
the
sense
that
you
would
have
after
a
case
was
tried.
unknown
speaker
then
are
you
saying
if
you
win,
it
should
go
back
for
a
trial
to
the
district
court?
