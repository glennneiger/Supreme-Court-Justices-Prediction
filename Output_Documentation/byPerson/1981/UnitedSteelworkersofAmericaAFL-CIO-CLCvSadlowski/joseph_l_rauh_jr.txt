mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
district
judge
hart
found
this
absolute
ban
on
contributions
outrageous.
that
is
not
my
word;
that
is
the
district
court's
word.
and
circuit
judge
mckinnon
for
a
unanimous
court
said
we
cannot
conceive
of
anything
that
would
do
more
to
inhibit
union
democracy
than
this
rule.
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
a
long-time
supporter
of
unionism,
has
fold
this
court
in
its
amicus
brief
that
elections
will
be
a
charade
if
this
continues.
all
these
of
these
conclusions
are
buttressed
by
a
statute
and
a
legislative
history
that
fairly
bristles
with
congress'
overriding
purpose
of
union
democracy.
there
has
only
been
one
president
ever
in
the
history
of
this
union
that
beat
an
incumbent,
and
you
know
what
he
was?
he
was
the
secretary
treasurer.
it
was
a
palace
revolt
and
every
other
time
there
has
been
a
re-election,
and
usually
like
the
last
time,
you
don't
even
get
a
contest.
now,
we
have
heard
a
lot
this
morning
about
title
iv.
we
haven't
heard
anything
about
title
i.
title
i
and
title...
title
i
contains
two
provisions,
both
of
which
apply
here.
one
is
the
right
to
sue
provision,
that
is
101(a)(4);
the
other
is
the
right
to
speak
provision,
that
is
101(a)(2).
the
district
court
outlawed
the
rule
under
101(a)(4)
the
right
to
sue;
the
court
of
appeals
under
101(a)(2),
the
right
to
speak.
it
preferred
to
invalidate
it
on
that
ground.
now,
section
101(b)
says
you
have
to
invalidate.
the
courts
have
to
invalidate
any
provision
of
a
constitution
that
violates
part
of
the
bill
of
rights.
that
is
exactly
what
both
courts,
all
four
judges
below,
did.
now
looking
first
at
101(a)(2),
the
right
to
express
any
views,
arguments
or
opinions
without
limitation.
now,
both
senator
mcclellan...
they
say
something
i
have
got
a
paucity
of
citations.
that
is
almost...
that
is
pretty
funny
if
you
think
that
we
have
the
man
who
put
in
the
bill
of
rights,
senator
mcclellan,
and
the
man
for
whom
the
bill
is
named
in
the
house
of
representatives,
representative
landrum...
it
is
called
the
landrum-griffin
bill...
both
says,
both
analogize
this
101(a)(2)
to
the
constitution.
and
of
course,
indeed,
it
is
funny
what
they
say.
they
admit
in
their
brief
that
101(a)(2)
recites
the
core
of
value
of
the
constitution.
well,
what
is
the
core
of
the
constitutional
free
speech?
it
is
the
right
of
effective
speech,
not
the
right
just
to
talk,
without
the
right
to
solicit
funds.
there
can
be
no
effective
speech...
i
am
not
relying
on
anything
i
have
ever
said
in
my
life;
i
rely
on
what
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
and
over
again.
buckley,
bellotti,
berkeley...
and
what
did
shaumberg,
justice
white
and
bates,
justice
blackmun...
they
recited
recently
that
these
rules,
they
are
not
just
something
that
came
down
in
bellotti
and
berkeley;
these
rules
have
been
here.
the
solicitation
of
funds
is
part
of
the
right
to
speak
a
speech.
without
funds...
that
isn't
new.
that's
old,
and
this
idea
that
suddenly--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--well,
i
go
all
the
way
back
to
patterson,
naacp
in
58,
go
back
to
cantwell
in
40
i
think,
your
honor.
but
i
will
say
that
i
take
the
review
that
either
justice
white
or
justice
blackmun
made
in
their
two
recent
cases,
suit
me
fine.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
am
saying
that
you
made
the
reviews
for
us.
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
of
saving
me
a
lot
of
time
on
research.
[laughter]
now
look,
this
court
has
said
it
so
often
that
it
is
sop,
that
the
first
amendment
has
its
fullest
and
most
urgent
applications
in
the
context
of
political
campaigns.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
not...
it
incorporates
the
basic
core
value
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
both
mcclellan
and
landrum
said
it,
your
honor.
and
i
guess
i
don't
believe
congress
always
uses
historical
language.
they
brought
in
a
different
provision,
i
believe,
when
the
senator
said
it
and
the
man
who
ran
the
bill
in
the
house
said
it.
i
think
that
is
the
best
evidence
of
the
intent.
the
words
are
very
clear,
if
your
honor
please.
opinion
views
the
words
are
in
some
ways,
can
be
as
broad
or
broader
than
the
first
amendment.
and
there
is
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
they
said
it
is
broader
than
the
first
amendment.
but
there
is
certainly
nothing
that
indicates
it
is
not
the
first
amendment.
but
going
back,
if
your
honor
please,
to
your
decisions
of
this
court,
on
the
fullest
and
most
urgent
application
is
at
election
time,
and
that
goes
double,
double
for
unions.
in
many
instances,
maybe
in
most,
the
only
time
you
ever
get
any
discussion
in
a
union
of
an
issue
is
during
an
election
campaign.
and
let
me
tell
you,
because
this
is
personal,
following
your
decision
in
travolidge
they
had
an
election
in
the
mineworkers,
and
with
concerned
outside
money
they
debated
violence
and
corruption
and
ended
the
dictatorial
rule,
and
that
would
never
have
been
ended
without
concerned
citizens
outside.
equally
relevant
is
hall
against
cole.
there
you
said
that
title
i
was
specifically
designed
to
protect
the
union
member's
right
to
seek
higher
office.
this
interrelates,
pulls
it
together.
union
democracy
and
speech.
and
that
was
the
purpose.
and
then
you
said,
oh,
counsel
has
to
be
available
to
make
speech
effective.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
it
would
be
a
simple
rule
to
have...
all
you
would
have
to
do,
your
honor,
is
say
nobody
give
more
than
$50
or
$100,
and
that
includes
the
staff,
and
you
would
have--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--what?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i...
would
be
a
reasonable
rule.
what
would
be
reasonable?
you
said
$1000
was
reasonable
for
a
federal
election.
i
am
willing
to
go
for
anything
that
would
be
reasonable.
i
think
a
lower
figure
for
a
union
election
than
you
have,
but
you
would
have
to
decide
what...
they
have
the
initial--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--yes,
it
would
decide
it,
and
you
would
have
a
right
of
review.
but
let
me
tell
you,
that
is
not
their
point.
they,
in
the
yellow
brief
at
page
12,
they
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
they
are
not
going
after
big
contributions;
they
are
going
after
lots
of
little
contributions.
their
complaint,
under
item
2
on
page
12,
is
that
we,
in
the
sadlowski
group,
solicited
progressive
lists,
and
they
say
very...
we
don't...
they
were
not
saying
they
refused
the
individual
non-member
contribution--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
is
a
10
and
then
there
is
a
12.
i
am
sorry.
we
can
hand
up
another
copy--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--are
you
looking
at
the
one
on
cert,
justice
o'connor?
because
there
is
also
one
on
the
merits,
and
that
would
explain
it.
at
page
12,
what
they
say
is,
it
is
not
huge
individual
ones.
what
they
are
complaining
about
is
small,
and
justice
marshall,
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
what
they
are
complaining
about
is
small
and
moderate-size
contributions
from
like-minded,
non-members.
they
are
not
complaining
about
big
ones.
coming
back
to
hall
and
cole--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--at
the
bottom,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
look
at
the
bottom.
do
you
see
item
2,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
under
that
you
will
see,
the
experience...
not
one
of
huge
individual
non-member
contributions,
but
of
nationwide
solicitations
of
lists
of
progressives.
and
then
at
the
bottom,
the
aggregates
of
small
and
moderate-sized
contributions.
they
have
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
here
is
a
progressive
who
took
lists
of
progressives
and
asked
them
to
help
him
let
them
get
money
so
they
can
get
the
progressive
message
to
the
membership
and
let
the
membership
decide.
it
couldn't
be
clearer
what
they
want.
they
don't
want
him
to
have
enough
money
to
put
his
message
across.
nobody
who
gives
a
few
dollars
on
these
lists
are
going
to
think
anybody
is
beholden
to
them.
this
was
an
effort
to
get
the
money
to
put
the
message
across,
which
your
honors
have
been
the
most
forceful
on
saying
one
has
a
right
to
do.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
that
is
fine.
you
could
do
disclosure,
you
can
do
a
reasonable
top.
the
reason
they
don't
want
a
reasonable
top
is
that
they
are
not
complaining
about
big
contributions.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
find
that
a
difficult
question,
your
honor.
but...
i
don't
know.
if
you
didn't
put
another
thing
on
the
staff,
it
won't
work,
because
that
can
just
stop
what
they
get
from
the
staff.
what
you
would
have
to
do
is
combine
that
50
%
with
some
staff.
you
can't...
i
could
buy
this.
put
50
%
on
what
you
can
get
from
the
outsiders
and
50
%
on
what
you
get
from
the
staff
and
maybe
you
have
got
a
rule
that
will
recreate
some
union
democracy.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
they
didn't
do
something
about
the
staff,
because
they
would
then
have
a
way
of
offsetting
and
making
it
difficult.
i
would
doubt
it
would
reasonable.
i
have
never
thought
about
that
before,
but
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
put
something
together
to
make
it
really
work.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
that
is
already
barred,
your
honor,
under
the
employer
provision,
so
that
is
barred.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
yes,
a
partnership
would
be
an
employer.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
the
same
thing
as
if
mr.
sadlowski
sent
out
the
letter.
if
somebody
sent
cut
the
letter
for
him,
that
would
be
all.
but
they
are
saying--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--no,
i
say
they
couldn't
bar
you
from
going
to
vast
numbers
of
people
to
get
small
contributions.
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
beholden
or
any
corruption
in
anything
like
that,
your
honor.
they
use
lists
of
people
and
ask
for
money.
so
mr.
sadlowski
who
is
a
progressive,
they
used
a
progressive
list,
could
get
his
message
to
the
membership
so
the
membership
could
decide.
the
membership
doesn't
have
to
vote
that
way.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
because
the
corporation
would
be
an
employer,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
whatever
industry,
but
i
think
it
has
to
mean
a
real
employer.
i
don't
go
nearly
as
far
as
they
do
that
if
you...
a
dentist
has
an
assistant,
that
that
makes
him
an
employer
for
this
purpose,
but
that
is
not
before
the
court,
your
honor.
now,
what
they
say--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--no,
sir.
and
i
was
surprised
to
hear
what
was
said
here.
on
page
74
of
the
record,
in
the
regulation
appears
the
following:
should
a
non-member
attempt
to
support
a
candidate
without
the
candidate's
solicitation
or
cooperation,
it
is
the
candidate's
obligation
to
immediately
contact
the
non-member,
reject
that
support
and
request
that
it
be
discontinued
and
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
avoid
such
support
having
an
effect
upon
the
election.
as
noted
above,
failure
to
do
so,
will
be
evidence
that
the
support
was
accepted.
they
have
done
everything
in
their
power
to
prevent
the
expenditures
that
they
informed
the
court
they
could
permit.
the
steelworkers
answer...
what
they
are
really
saying
is
you,
challenger
of
the
income,
but
you
go
get
it
from
the
rank
and
file.
that
is
what
they
are
saying.
that
comes
with
poor
grace.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
but
for
the...
as
an
incumbent
you
are
ahead
of
the
challenger,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
and
we
got
3
%.
they
got
all
of
theirs.
we
are
free.
can
sleep
under
the
bridge,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
would
say
it
comes
with
poor
grace
for
them
to
tell
us
to
go
the
rank
and
file,
and
this
is
admitted.
they
got
90
%
of
their
funds
from
the
staff.
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
joint
appendix
references,
173
where
we
have
an
affidavit
saying
this,
and
347
and
48
where
they
do
not
challenge
it
in
their
response.
now,
if
we
can't...
if
they
can't
get
money
from
the
rank
and
file
and
get
90
%
from
their
staff,
how
in
heaven's
name
are
we
to
do
what
they
can't
do?
now,
as
i
said,
the
steelworkers
reply
brief
at
page
12
does
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
for
what
they...
they
once
used
to
say
they
were
out
to
stop
corruption,
big
contributions.
now
they
say
flatly
no,
we
are
out
to
stop
your
solicitation
of
like-minded
concerned
citizens.
i
don't
see
how
that
could
ever
be
squared
with
title
i,
section
101(a)(2).
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
where
moderate
and
small
contributions
from
like-minded
citizens...
it
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
we
did
when
we
upset
the
boyle
thing
after
the
travolidge
decision
gave
us
a
chance.
it
is
a
perfect
example
of
democracy
in
trying
to
get
funds
to
get
your
message
across.
they
can
still
say...
this
is
not
a
question
like
441(e)
that
was
referred
to.
that
was
a
wholly
different
thing.
that
is
the
provision
of
law
that
prevents
a
non-resident
alien
from
giving
to
a
federal
campaign.
but
that
works
in
our
favor.
resident
aliens
who
can't
vote
can
give.
the
only
reason
a
non-resident
alien
is
in
there
is
for
security
reasons,
people
that
are
abroad
and
also
they
haven't...
a
non-resident
alien
doesn't
have
the
rights
that
a
resident
alien
does.
but
a
resident
alien
can
give,
even
though
he
can't
vote.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
if
they...
they
all
are.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
and
so
is
counsel
members
of
the
union.
that
is
how
this
comes
up,
you
know.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
you
will
have
to
ask--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--i
know
they
are
members
of
the
union.
you
will
have
to
ask
the
other
side
how
they
work
that
our,
sir.
i
just
don't
see
a
clear
care
of
your
statute...
here
you
have
got
the
language,
right
to
express
any
views,
arguments
or
opinions.
the
legislative
history
of
the
parallelism
to
the
constitution
from
the
two
men
who
would
be
the
most
important,
and
the
pre-eminent
purpose
of
congress
is
for
union
democracy.
you
know,
sometimes
i
think
why
did
they
need
to
do
this?
they
have
got
so
many
advantages
on
the
incumbent
anyway,
it
is
hard
to
see
why
they
had
to
go
ahead
and
put
this
final
nail
in
a
challenger's
coffin.
but
the
purpose
of
this
statute...
this
court
has
over
and
over
again,
in
dealing
with
landrum-griffin
said,
a
lot
of
it
was
written
on
the
floor.
the
bill
of
rights
was
written
on
the
floor.
has
said
well,
we
will
look
at
the
objectives
of
this
statute.
well,
the
objective
of
union
democracy
is
perfectly
clear,
and
of
course,
doing
this
does
avoid
any
reference
to
any
constitutional
problem.
the
steelworkers
rule,
based
on
all
of
this,
and
i
quote
from
the
man
who
has
done
the
most
writing
and
work,
the
professor
who
has
done
the
most
on
the
whole
subject
of
union
democracy,
professor
clyde
somers.
his
affidavit
is
in
the
record.
he
says,
this
rule
virtually
guarantees
that
incumbents
will
be
insulated
from
electoral
challenge.
with
every
principle
of
statutory
construction
the
other
way,
to
knock
it
out,
to
leave
it
there
is
so
clearly
contrary
to
congress'
intent.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
a
certain
minimum
amount
is
necessary
to
get
your
message
across,
your
honor,
because
you
have
got
1,300,000
voters,
you
have
got
a
staff
on
one
side
and
you
have
just
got
to
have
something.
i
don't
say...
no,
i
do
not
assume
it
is
controlled
by
money,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
a
minimum
amount
of
money
is
necessary.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
so...
many
times
more,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
we
did
not
feel
that
was
necessary.
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
the
record
on
what
an
ordinary
senator--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--a
million,
three
members.
i
don't
know
how
much
that
would
mean
in
money,
but
nothing
was
spent
by
us...
and
we
got
as
much
as
we
could
out
of
the
staff.
we
got
as
much
as
we
could
out
of
the
staff,
that
was
nothing.
we
got
as
much
as
we
could
out
of
the
rank
and
file;
that
was
substantial,
but
we
did
get
a
lot
from
lists
of
concerned
citizens,
and
that
was
the
only
place
we
could
go.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
clear--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--oh,
there
is
not
in
this.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
see
any
possibility.
all
that
it
does
is
to
get
like-minded
citizens
to
contribute
to
this
man
so
he
can
put
his
message,
like
minded
message,
over
and
win
or
lose
fairly--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--furthermore--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--well
because,
mr.
sadlowski
could
have
written
this
letter
to
the...
they
talk
about
letters
that
were
written
by...
sadlowski,
they
were
letters
that
sadlowski
could
have
written
to
those
lists--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--i
think
if
it
wasn't
so
overbroad,
i
think
you
could
say...
certainly
you
can
say
you
can't
give
more
than
$1000,
and
i
think
you
can
go
below
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
that
were
real...
if
that
were
a
real
danger,
yes.
if
that
were
a
real
danger
and
a
real
way
to
settle
the
over-breadth,
yes.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
real
danger
because
the
money
is
really
being
asked
for
in
sadlowski's
name.
but
if
you
want
to
say
you
couldn't
ask
for
more,
so
sadlowski
would
have
to
ask
for
it
all
himself,
that
wouldn't
trouble
me.
but
if
you
could
say
there
can't
be
a
middleman
in
the
fund-raising,
probably
that
is
not
so
terrible.
but
that
is
not
their
reason.
they
say
flatly
on
page
12
of
their
yellow
reply
brief
that
they
don't
want
small
contributions--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--well,
your
thoughts,
yes.
that
would
be
all
right.
this
is
just
so
broad
as
to--
well,
101(a)(2)
settles
it,
and
it
settle
it
for
the
court
below.
but
you
could
make
an
alternative
decision
under
101(a)(4).
remember
that
this
was
aimed
at
sadlowski
and
his
lawyers.
they
say...
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
here
that
there
was
some
suggestion
that
they
hadn't
intended
litigation,
to
block
litigation.
they
said,
oh,
you
can
have
personal
service,
but
you
can't
use
your
secretary,
you
can't
use
your
office,
you
can't
use
your
supplies.
how
could
any
lawyer
represent
anybody
pro
bono
who
is
an
insurgent
and
they
need
lawyers...
god
knows
they
have
admitted
you
have
got
to
have
a
lawyer
in
this
fight.
how
could
anybody
represent
them,
using
your
personal
services,
and
not
be
able
to
use
your
secretary,
your
office
and
your
staff?
and
they
bar
using
them,
in
flat
terms
they
barred
using
your
secretary,
your
staff
and
your
office.
of
course
this
was
aimed
at
stopping
litigation.
indeed,
at
the
same
time
that
they
did
this,
they
started
a
lawsuit
to
stop
litigation.
they
sued
the
association
for
union
democracy
to
stop
litigation.
the
case
came
to
this
court
two
years
ago,
mcbridge
against
rockefeller.
this
case
was
here,
and
this
court
denied
cert.
but
the
case
was
here,
you
saw
it.
they
tried
to
prevent
any
litigation
because
the
people,
you
couldn't...
funds
have
to
be
raised
for
the
expenses.
lawyers
may
feel
deeply
enough
for
union
democracy
that
they
will
work
for
nothing,
but
there
are
expenses.
and
those
were
paid
by
these
organizations
and
they
brought
a
lawsuit
to
prevent
that.
there
is
no
question
what
the
purpose
of
this
was;
it
was
to
stop
that
kind
of--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--i
sure
do.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
because
he
even
went
further.
if
you
look
at
that,
your
honor,
they
say
well,
if
the
suit
wasn't
bona
fide,
why,
that
is
then
not
permitted.
of
course,
the
wirtz
opinion
clearly
conflicts
with
the
clear
language
of
the
rule,
with
its
purpose
and
everything.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
you
are
not
hand-picked
and
paid
by
one
of
the
litigants,
your
honor.
you
are
an
independent
body.
when
you
make
an
opinion
that
is
determinative,
but
when
you
are
a
hand-picked
committee
paid
by
one
of
the
parties,
you
are
a
lot
different.
indeed,
you
said
this,
or
the
court
said
this
in
the
steel
case,
where
you
wouldn't
even
let
the
railroad
adjustment
board,
which
is
only
a
third
union
people,
make
decisions
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
a
third
union
controlled,
and
this
was
a
union
grievance
by
blacks
against
the
union.
now,
there
is
only
one...
as
i
said,
101(a)(2)
applies,
101(a)(4)
applies.
the
question
is
what
would
you
do
under
101(a)(4).
why
is
it
you
can't
rewrite
the
rule?
judge
hart
was
right.
the
court
of
appeals
preferred
to
put
it
on
another
ground,
but
judge
hart
was
right
when
he
said
that
the
unlawful
effects
of
this
rule
have
a
chilling
effect.
he
doesn't
want
to
rewrite
it,
it
can't
be
rewritten,
and
i
suggest
it
can't
be
rewritten,
if
your
honor
please.
it
can't
be
rewritten
because
you
have
got
all
sorts
of
things
that
have
to
be
dealt
with.
if
the
statute...
if
you
rewrite,
do
you
say
oh,
it
has
got
to
be
a
bona
fide
suit,
as
they
complained,
or,
it
can't
be
intended
to
extract
political
gain,
as
judge
mckinnon
laughed
at
in
his
opinion.
or,
what
do
you
say
about
this?
they
argue
that
you
can't
use
the
money
to
get
the
word
out
about
the
lawsuit.
well,
suppose
there
is
a
lawsuit,
and
suppose
that
lawsuit
is
won
and
suppose
they
had
done
some
things
that
were
bad.
you
mean,
that
can't
be
told
to
the
public?
you
can't
rewrite
this
rule
for
them.
of
course,
it
really
doesn't
matter.
if
i
am
right
on
101(a)(2),
i
just
think
it
would
be
better
for
union
democracy,
which
i
am
here
pleading
for,
be
better
for
union
democracy
if
you
knocked
it
out
on
both,
because
then
people
will
realize
that
there
is
something
serious.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
unions
are
not
private
associations,
as
were
made
here.
congress
has
given
tremendous
assistance
to
the
building
of
american
unions
since
the
wagner
act
47
years
ago,
and
it
has
fortified
unions
with
exclusive
authority
to
represent
and
require
dues
from
even
those
who
do
not
want
that
representation.
in
59,
congress
realized
they
had
to
do
something
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
public
and
to
make
those
rights
count.
so
what
did
they
do?
they
set
up
a
statute
where
union
democracy
would
flourish.
all
four
judges
below
have
held
that
both
the
purpose
in
two
express
provisions
of
this
bill
repel
the
steelworkers
attack
on
union
democracy.
i
believe
in
exclusivity
of
union
representatives.
i
believe
in
the
union
shop.
i
have
worked
for
them.
but
those
things
bring
something
else.
they
bring
a
responsibility
with
them,
and
this
provision,
this
stopping
of
the
slightest
help
for
those
who
would
challenge
an
incumbent,
those
are
not
carrying
out
the
responsibility
and
the
favors
and
the
held
that
the
congress
of
this
country
gave
unions.
