mr.
william
e.
hegarty
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
begin
by
going
back
to
1936,
to
the
era
that
justice
powell
referred
to.
in
the
congressional
debates,
the
senate
debate
concerning
the
1936
amendments
to
the
commodity
exchange
act,
a
decision
of
this
court
was
read
into
the
record.
that
decision
had
held
that
the
pre-existing
act
could
not
provide
a
remedy
against
someone
who
was
accused
of
having
manipulated
the
market
because
the
statute
was
framed
in
terms
of
is
manipulating,
present
tense.
this
court
said
that
the
proceeding
could
not
go
forward.
it
affirmed
the
lower
court,
which
it
so
held.
it
said,
and
this,
as
i
say,
was
read
into
the
record,
the
entire
decision
by
justice
brandeis,
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court,
to
supply
omissions
transcends
the
judicial
function.
i
don't
believe
that
the
perception
of
the
role
of
the
congress
and
of
the
judiciary
in
1936
and
earlier,
and
even
since
has
been...
has
gone
through
the
sea
changes
that
are
suggested
by
the
respondents
and
by
the
cftc.
indeed,
much
mention
has
been
made
of
rigsby.
in
that
decision,
it
seems
to
me,
as
i
read
it,
that
justice
pitney
was
very,
very
careful
to
have
two
bases
for
his
decision.
one
indeed
was
for
the
use
of
the
remedium,
but
immediately
thereafter
he
said
the
inference
is
made
irresistible
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
i
don't
think
that
is
very
different
from
cort
v.
ash,
if
one
thinks
about
it.
now,
the
argument
in
the
earlier
case
is
different
in
two
respects
from
the
questions
presented
presently.
that
case
involves
a
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act,
section
4b,
which
is
for
the
benefit
quite
plainly
by
claim
of
a
customer
and
it
provides
that
his
broker
may
not
defraud
him.
that
language
might
suffice
for
the
first
factor
in
cort.
representing
a
contract
market,
i
am
addressing
different
sections,
sections
5d,
5a(8),
and
perhaps
9b,
which
is
the
general
criminal
statute
against
manipulation.
5d
is
the
licensing
statute.
it
says
that
boards
of
trade
will
be
designated
as
contract
markets
if
they
satisfy
certain
criteria,
one
of
which
is
to
have
a
system
to
prevent
manipulation...
not
to
prevent
manipulation,
but
to
have
a
system
to
prevent
it.
5a(8)
is
prescriptive.
it
says
that
one
of
the
things
the
contract
market
must
do
is
enforce
its
rules.
these
are
quite
patently
for
the
general
benefit
of
the...
well,
it
certainly
goes
far
beyond
the
futures
market.
it
goes
to
the
cash
market,
as
it
is
called,
the
production,
the
handling,
the
use
of
commodities.
the
other
very
significant
distinction
between
the
4b
question
and
the
question
posed
as
against
a
contract
market
is
a
practical
distinction.
it
is
a
question
of
practical
consequences,
and
implicit,
if
i
can
use
the
word
in
this
general
context,
holding
of
the
second
circuit
or
the
court
below
was
that
a
cash
trader,
that
is,
a
person
not
trading
in
the
futures
market
at
all,
but
holding
cash
potatoes,
had
a
claim
against
the
contract
market
because
of
an
alleged
failure
on
its
part
to
act
in
an
emergency.
that
opens
up,
it
seems
to
me,
the
picture
of
not
only
which
we
would
have
in
the
securities
acts
functioning
on
the
trading
in
a
particular
security
or
something
of
that
sort.
it
goes
beyond
that.
it
is
trading
in
a
futures
contract,
but
then
the
impact
of
that
trading,
that
alleged
manipulation
might
have
on
the
cash
product.
in
other
words,
manipulation
in
wheat
in
the
chicago
board
of
trade,
the
price
fixed
in
the
chicago
board
of
trade
is
used,
as
they
call
it,
for
price
discovery
by
those
who
are
actually
delivering
wheat
to
mills.
this
is,
as
judge
mansfield
said
in
dissent
below,
what
is
involved
is
literally
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars.
now,
i
don't
cite
that
in
a
kind
of
interorum
way.
i
cite
it
for
this
purpose.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
consequences
are
such,
when
the
possible
result
is
such,
it
bears
very
directly
on
whether
one
can
assume
that
congress
intended
such
a
result
but
chose
not
to
say
so,
which
after
all
is
the
fundamental
question.
i
regret
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
did
not
choose
to
argue
in
this
case,
to
deal
with
questions
of
that
sort,
although
they
briefed
in
this
case.
now,
the
three
sections
that
interest
the
contract
markets
are
section
5d,
as
i
said.
that
was
enacted
in
1921.
at
that
time,
a
companion
statute
enacted
the
same
month
was
the
packers
and
stockyards
act,
which
provided
both
for
reparations
and
private
damages
against
the
stockyard
and
others,
and
i
think
it
is
suggested
that
the
two
statutes
go
in
tandem,
and
no
such
remedy
is
provided
in
the
commodity...
as
it
was
then
called,
the
grain
futures
act,
i
think.
9b
was
enacted
in
1936,
and
as
i
say,
in
wallace
against
cutten,
a
case
which
i
quoted
from,
it
was
before
congress,
very
much
before
congress
at
that
point.
5a(8),
as
i
say,
subdivision
a(8)
was
added
to
5a
in
1968,
at
a
time
when
congress
did
not
enact
a
bill
which
would
have
provided
an
action
against
contract
markets.
now
we
come
to
1974,
and
a
unanimous
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
legislative
history
was
emphatically
equivocal
in
that
that
was
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
predicate
a
private
right
of
action.
mr.
william
e.
hegarty
it
is.
i
think
it
was
very
well
chosen.
mr.
william
e.
hegarty
"equivocal".
0
[generallaughter.]
they
said
also,
to
substantiate
their
point,
justice
white,
that
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
was
aware
of
the
one
appellate
court
decision--
mr.
william
e.
hegarty
--that
is
what
the
court
below
said,
your
honor,
but
the
fifth
circuit
thought
that
the
evidence
was
dubious,
if
you
will,
that
congress
as
a
whole
had
any
awareness
of
the
one
decision,
one
appellate
decision
that
upheld
a
cause
of
action
against
a
contract
market.
they
said
there
was
no
evidence
that
congress
had
approved
it.
in
the
opinion
from
the
majority
below,
it
was
described
as
implicit
approval
by
congress,
and
i
think
to
premise
an
implied
right
of
action
upon
an
implicit
approval
by
congress
in
emphatically
equivocal
legislative
history
piles
too
much
on
too
shaky
a
foundation.
in
1974,
if
you
look
at
objective
evidence
again
as
to
contract
markets,
they
did
not
enact
a
private
action
against
contract
markets.
they
did
enact
the
reparations
remedy
from
which
contract
markets
are
excluded.
they
did
specifically
authorize
the
cftc
to
bring
injunction
for
suits
in
district
courts
against
contract
markets,
and
they
added
to
the
penalty
provision
the
direction
to
the
cftc
to
consider
whether
the
amount
of
the
penalty
would
materially
impair
the
contract
market's
ability
to
carry
on
its
operations
and
duties,
and
i
don't
think
a
possible
exposure
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
could
be
said
to
be
consistent
with
that.
if
there
was
a
dramatic
overhaul
of
the
statute
in
1974,
it
is
similar
to
that
which
occurred
and
was
the
subject
of
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
milwaukee.
there
had
been
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
for
nuisance.
the
seventh
circuit
had
held
here
that
there
was
a
common
law
cause
of
action
against
contract
markets,
the
one
appellate
decision.
i
think
it
would
follow
that
such
a
contract...
common
law
cause
of
action
had
been
supplanted
by
the
legislation.
finally,
let
me
say
this.
the
question
posed
is,
is
there
a
private
right
of
action,
is
there
an
implied
private
right
of
action,
but
that
is
a
very,
very
narrow
question.
the
question
really
should
be,
is
there
a
private
right
of
action
having
certain
dimensions?
for
example,
there
is
no
guidance
whatsoever
in
this
statute
for
a
determination,
as
was
present
in
the
case
of
ocville,
as
to
what
standard
of
liability
should
exist,
what
measure
of
culpability
is
required
for
this
action.
if
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
this
case,
where
negligence
is
alleged,
i
would
move
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
bad
faith
had
not
been
alleged.
but
i
have
no
guidance.
the
district
court
will
have
none
it
is
too
simplistic
a
question
to
ask
whether
a
private
right
of
action
is
implied,
i
submit.
i
will
say
one
final
point,
if
i
may,
in
answer
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
white
earlier
on.
i
think
there
must
be
affirmative
evidence
to
create
the
action.
we
cannot
invert
the
burden
of
inquiry,
as
occurred
here.
i
don't
wish
to
intrude
upon
the
time
of
counsel
to
argue
for
the
brokers,
unless
there
be
any
questions.
perhaps
i
should
say
further
intrude.
