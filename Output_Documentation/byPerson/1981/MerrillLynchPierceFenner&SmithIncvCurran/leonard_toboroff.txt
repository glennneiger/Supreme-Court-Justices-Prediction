mr.
leonard
toboroff
mr.
justice,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
so
far
in
the
presentations
so
far,
facts
have
been
withheld
by
the
defendants,
understandably
so
because
they
are
crucial
to
the
application
of
this
court's
standards
to
this
statute
determining
legislative
intent.
the
facts
are
these.
in
a
limited
and
perishable
commodity,
potatoes
manipulators
named
simplot
and
taggares
oversold
the
entire
crop
threefold.
they
never
intended
to
liquidate
it.
their
contracts...
to
take
delivery
of
their
short
sales,
and
as
a
result
they
artificially
depressed
the
price,
irrespective
of
the
normal
supply
and
demand
factors,
which
are
what
the
commodity
futures
markets
have
the
right
to
expect.
in
short,
they
and
their
brokers
fixed
the
market
and
ultimately
destroyed
it,
in
full
view
of
the
exchange,
which
knowingly
permitted
it.
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
deal
with
a
free
and
fair
futures
market
pursuant
to
the
congressional
purpose
and
in
accordance
with
the
legislative
scheme.
instead,
they
were
thrown
into
a
fixed
market
manipulated
by
simplot,
taggares,
and
others
who
are
not
before
this
court
in
this
process,
and
not
subject
at
all
to
reparations,
incidentally,
and
who
have
carefully
and
tactically
absented
themselves
from
this
court
here,
but
their
conduct
is
not
absent.
no
one
challenges
that
the
conduct
violated
the
statute.
no
one
challenges
that
the
market
was
polluted
in
violation
of
the
congressional
purpose.
those
facts
delineating
that
conduct
by
those
people
are
set
forth
in
exhaustive
detail
by
judge
friendly
below
in
the
record,
at
pages
95
through
105
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
i
will
refrain
from
repeating
any
of
them,
but
will
rely
on
that
exposition,
and
note
that
if
judge
friendly
is
reversed,
those
major
manipulators
will
go
scot
free,
leaving
their
victims
behind
them,
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
congress,
the
purpose
that
congress
expressed
when
it
amended
or
re-enacted
the
statute
will
also
be
frustrated,
and
the
legislative
scheme
will
be
robbed
of
one
of
its
crucial
pieces
that
make
up
its
symmetry,
which
is
the
private
right
of
action.
i
think
at
this
point
i
should
first
briefly
address
the
question
that
mr.
justice
powell
asked
with
respect
to
the
1936
statute.
in
1974,
sir,
congress
switched
its
theory.
they
changed
from
allowing
the
exchanges
to
regulate
themselves
through
self-regulation
to
compulsory
regulation
at
the
behest
of
the
newly
created
cftc.
one
congressman
described
the
self-regulation
as
1974.
we
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
intent
in
1974.
when
that
happened,
when
they
switched
their
theory,
the
exchanges
promptly
went
to
congress
and
said,
well,
give
us
immunity.
we
want
immunity
from
the
private
right
of
action.
congress
didn't
grant
them
that
immunity.
that
is
the
theory
that
came
into
being
in
1974,
so
we
have
a
turnover
from
1936
into
1974,
compelling
us
to
examine
1974,
and
we
would
concede
that
that
is
the
legislative
history
that
needs
to
be
examined.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
are
you
asking,
sir,
if
this
case
arose,
the
statute
came
down
in
1976--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--we
would
still
have
the
private
right
of
action,
because
we
had
something
else
in
addition
to
the
unbroken
chain
of
eleven
to
fourteen
decisions.
we
have
50
years
of
congressional
experience,
starting
in
1921,
as
to
major
market
manipulations.
this
is
not
like
the
curran
situation,
the
customer-broker.
we
have
a
situation
where
from
1921
on
congress
focused
concern
on
the
major
market
manipulators.
they
named
some
of
them
in
some
of
the
congressional
testimony.
i
can't
remember
their
names.
i
remember
one,
arthur
cutten,
i
think.
but
they
named
a
bunch
of
them,
and
they
focused
their
concern
on
that
person,
or
that
group
of
persons,
who
through
large
concentrations
of
money
could
throw
an
entire
market
out
of
whack.
congress
was
not
writing
on
a
blank
slate.
it
had
all
kinds
of
experience.
i
submit
that
that
is
what
the
recent
cases
hold.
the
defendants
would
have
us
believe
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
statutory
language
and
stop.
if
there
is
not
any
explicit
statutory
language,
that
is
it.
transamerica
teaches
differently.
transamerica
says
you
can
go
to
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
to
the
circumstances
of
its
enactment,
which
is
the
legislative
history.
judge
friendly
had
the
transamerica,
touche
ross,
and
cannon
in
front
of
him
when
he
went
through
this,
and
he
used
those
cases,
that
1979
triad
of
cases,
to
support,
very
painstakingly,
support
his
inevitable
conclusion
that
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
in
accordance
with
the
standards
set
forth
by
this
court.
now,
there
have
been
about
six,
i
think...
i
will
take
a
guess
and
say
six...
decisions
since
the
1979
triad.
they
don't
change
the
standards.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
well--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--there
should
be--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--that
there
should
be
a
private
right
of
action?
mr.
leonard
toboroff
a
bit
more.
congress
justifiably
could
and
justifiably
did
assume
that
the
private
right
of
action
was
in
place--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--and
did
not
disturb
it,
but
more
than
that.
i
say
a
bit
more
because
i
am
returning,
i
think,
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
he
asked,
was
there
a
supreme
court
decision,
and
there
was,
and
it
was
there
a
supreme
deaktor,
and
it
was
explained,
the
deaktor
case.
now,
everybody
has
made
light
of
the
deaktor
case.
i
think
deaktor
deserves
a
bit
more
attention.
not
whether
or
not
deaktor
was
wrong.
deaktor
implicitly
recognized
the
private
right
of
action.
not
whether
or
not
it
was
wrong,
but
it
was
a
united
states
supreme
court
decision
decided
on
december
3rd,
1973,
just
ten
days
before
representative
poge
opened
the
congressional
hearings
with
the
statement
that--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--no,
deaktor...
there
was
a
memorandum
opinion
in
deaktor
on
december
3,
1974,
i
believe.
i
am
sure.
when
that
case
came
down,
ten
days
later,
chairman
poge
opened
the
hearings
and
emphasized
to
the
entire
house,
and
i
am
quoting,
"courts
have
implied
a
private
remedy
for
individual
litigants
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
"
now,
even
if
deaktor
was
wrong,
and
i
don't
think
it
was...
i
think
it
was
right...
but
even
if
it
was
wrong,
congress
understood
that
the
courts,
including
the
united
states
supreme
court,
had
the
question
before
it,
and
everyone
had
recognized,
without
a
hint
of
a
dissent,
that
there
was
a
private
right
of
action,
and
that
is
when
congress
set
down--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--congress
had...
pardon
me--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--i
didn't
put
it
that
way.
i
will
agree
with
you,
but
i
didn't
put
it
that
way.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
in
that
case,
i
will
take
the
next
question.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
right.
as
judge--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--all
the
remedies
were
in
place
then,
in
1936.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
on
my
friends
over
here
on
my
left.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
yes,
sir.
my
fire
and
fall
back
position
on
that
question
is
this.
it
depends...
when
congress
sits
down,
it
depends
what
they
are
writing
on,
the
slate
that
they
are
writing
on.
even
without
that
line,
that
chain,
that
unbroken
chain
of
decisions,
even
without
that,
they
had
the
experience.
there
was
a
reason
that
they
sat
down,
50
years
of
experience,
to
protect...
and
the
purpose
was
to
protect
the
american
consumer
through
the
operation
of
a
fair
and
free
market
for
the
benefit
of
the
investors,
the
traders
that
come
into
that
market.
there
is
no
market
without
traders
like
that.
the
market
simply
doesn't
exist
without
speculators.
now,
to
have...
i
think
it
is
quite
a
fire
and
fall
back
position.
there
were
50
years
of
experience,
more
than
50
years.
these
markets
had
been
polluted
many,
many
times.
the
proof
of
the
pudding
of
what
i
am
stating
is
as
follows.
after
july
8,
1980,
after
judge
friendly's
decision
on
july
8,
1980,
there
has
not
been
another
major
market
manipulation.
up
until
then,
they
were
legion.
even
between...
even
after
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaints
in
1979,
bang,
along
came
the
silver
manipulation.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
surely,
sir.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
i
will
finally
retreat
to
the
recent
decisions,
but
i
say
that
our
case
is
sui
generis
and
miles
distant
from
those
decisions,
because
of
those
two
experiences.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
the
deaktor
case
was...
there
were
two
cases.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
it
was
recognized
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
commodity
exchange
act,
and
i
can
quote
you
to
the
section,
or
the
analysis
of
it
which
appears
in
judge
friendly's
decision
in
the
record
below,
which
seems
the
easiest
place
to
get
it.
may
i
come
back
to
that,
sir?
i
have
it
somewhere,
but
i--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--that
is
my
point,
sir.
the
very
words...
i
tried
to
jot
them
down
fast
as
read,
were
cea>
["],
which
was
in
the
record
below,
was
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
repetition
of
that
language
by
the
supreme
court
on
december
13...
december
3...
pardon
me...
1973,
is
crucial
to
the
consideration
of
that
case
by
the
house
ten
days
later.
that
is
why
i
say
that
it
is
an
important
consideration,
and
that
this
court
implicitly
recognized
that,
but
even
if
this
court
didn't
implicitly
recognize
it,
congress
must
have
understood
that
it
was
implicitly
recognized
by
this
court.
therefore,
when
congress
sat
down
ten
days
later,
with
deaktor
in
front
of
it,
they
recognized
the
prior
right
of
action.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
i
understand
that.
my
point
is
a
little
bit
short
of
that.
my
point
is
that
congress
understood
from
a
whole
line
of
decisions
that
there
was
a
private
right
of
action,
and
then
you
have
deaktor,
which
doesn't
refute
that,
where
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
allegation
is
violations
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
against
an
exchange.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
the
memorandum
decision--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--i
tried
to
preface
that,
sir,
by
saying
i
wanted
to
make
a
bit
more
of
that
case
than
what
it
is,
because
of
the
time
frame
in
which
it
came
down.
if
i
didn't
articulate
that
properly,
i
would
like
to
do
it
now.
my
reason
for
bearing
in
on
that
a
little
heavy
was
the
time
frame
that
it
came
down
and
what
congress
could
have
reasonably
been
given
to
understand
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
private
right
of
action.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
yes,
sir,
and
the
seventh
circuit
decision
as
well.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
they
would
have
taken
to
be
the
law,
i
respectfully
submit,
that
there
was
a
private
right
of
action--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--the
supreme
court
decision
did
not
overrule
the
allegations
of
violations
against
the...
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
against
the
exchange
that
were
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
yes,
sir.
i
would
also
like
to
meet
head-on,
as
judge
friendly
did
in
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
powell
where
the
statute
doesn't
utter
a
single
word
in
its
language.
as
i
say,
you
must
go
through
that
language.
you
must
look
at
everything,
and
concluding
from
that
language
that
there
is
a
private
right
of
action.
the
exchange
in
its
reply
brief
wants
to
stop
at
the
front
door
of
the
language
in
the
statute,
and
they
wind
it
up
by
sort
of
a
little
bit
of
a
scare
tactic,
saying
that
if
we
don't
stop
here,
we
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
clogged
dockets.
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
lawsuits.
they
are
asking
for,
it
seems
to
me,
a
little
bit
of
judicial
legislation
today,
something
they
couldn't
get
in
1974
when
congress
switched
the
theory
from
self-regulation
to
compulsory
regulation,
and
i
rather
think
that
isn't
entirely
true.
i
rather
think
that
the
way
to
empty
the
dockets
is
just
to
affirm
judge
friendly's
decision.
there
are
no
more
major
market
manipulations,
and
there
won't
be
a
lot
of
cases
because
there
won't
be
any
manipulations.
i
think
that
is
the
best
way
to
do
it,
and
i
think
that
is
what
congress
intended,
and
i
think
that
in
the
congressional
scheme,
the
legislative
scheme
and
the
congressional
purpose,
the
private
right
of
action
was
one
of
the
principal
spokes
in
the
wheel
that
congress
always
understood
to
be
there.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
i
would
say,
first
of
all,
the
commodity
markets
are
a
great
deal
different
than
the
security
markets.
the
security
laws
are
the
closest
analogue,
and
i
agree
to
that
but
i
would
say
or
i
would
ask
lord
knows
how
many
manipulations
in
the
securities
markets
we
would
have
if
manipulators
of
those
markets
were
not
responsible
in
united
states
courts.
i
can't
see
any
kind
of
a...
if
they
had
a
reparations
provision
under
the
securities
laws,
i
would
presume
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
there
that
is
happening
here.
it
is
a
limited,
small
claims
type
of
remedy
that
doesn't
reach
the
people
like
simplot
and
taggares.
they
go
away
scot
free
to
do
other
manipulations
in
other
markets.
they
are
not
liable
to
any
redness
from,
the
victims
that
they
plucked,
and
if
you
affirm
judge
friendly
today,
simplot
and
taggares,
for
instance,
will
not
manipulate
another
potato
market.
other
manipulators
of
soybeans,
silver,
porkbellies,
orange
juice,
they
won't
manipulate
those
markets,
because
they
will
be
subject
to
the
only
true'economic
incentive
redress
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
against
him,
and
that
is
the
private
litigant.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
i
think
in
10b(5),
as
i
say,
the
securities
markets
are
a
little
different
from
the
commodities
markets.
i
am
not
arguing
in
the
customer
account
here.
most
of
the
legion
of
cases
under
10b(5)
are
these
customer
account
cases.
they
are
not
broad
market
manipulations
where,
for
instance,
the
price
of
coffee
goes
up
from
of
cents
to
$5.40
a
pound
inside
of
two
months,
or
where
the
price
of
silver
goes
from
$4
an
ounce
to
$52
an
ounce
inside
of
five
or
six
months.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
right,
and
almost
taking
down
the
securities
markets
and
brokerage
firms
with
it.
that...
what
is
at
stake
here
in
leist
against
simplot,
in
this
case,
these
three
consolidated
cases,
is
the
manipulation
of
a
vast
national
market,
affecting
the
national
economy,
if
you
will,
not
the
squabble
between
the
customer
and
his
broker.
i
submit
that
most
of
the
legion
of
cases
that
you
will
find
in
the
securities
laws
are
the
squabbling
type,
where
somebody
has
lost
$50,000
or
$100,000
and
goes
and
gets
a
lawyer,
and
there
is
a
private
right
of
action.
here,
that
is
basically
the
sixth
circuit
case,
that
is
basically
the
fifth
circuit
case,
but
it
isn't
this
case.
this
case
deals
with
what
is
really
at
stake
in
this
statute.
these
are
the
very
evils
that
congress
tried
to
prevent
in
1974
and
had
a
50-year
history
of.
i
am
practically
giving
you
1974
facts
in
1976.
it
is
practically
in
materia,
in
para
materia,
and
it
is
not
sleight
of
hand.
it
actually
happened.
congress
didn't
know
that
these
people
would
go
out
and
manipulate
the
potato
market
in
1976,
but
they
knew
from
50
years
of
experience
that
other
markets
had
been
manipulated
all
along
the
line.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
because
in
1974,
when
they
sat
down
to
write
the
law,
they
had
every
reason
to
expect,
justifiably
expect,
and
did
justifiably
expect
that
the
private
right
of
action
was
in
place.
exchanges,
brokers,
futures
commission
merchants
asked
them
about
it,
and
it
stayed
in
there.
all
kinds
testimony...
in
the
closing
statement,
i
think,
on
september
9,
1974,
chairman
talmadge,
the
head
of
the
senate
committee,
said
that...
he
was
talking
about
the
various
remedies
that
were
provided
by
the
new
act.
he
said,
they
will
not
interfere
with
the
courts
in
any
way.
that
alone,
if
you
followed
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
that
alone
seems
to
me
to
be
fatal
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
not
enough
legislative
intent
to
find
a
private
right
of
action
here.
if
you
get
into
the
legislative
intent,
the
defendants
are
swamped,
and
they
lose.
it
is
full
of
legislative
intent,
and
talking
about
the
standards
that
have
to
be
applied,
i
believe--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--reparations
remedies,
sir,
are
meaningless
as
to
us,
probably
as
to
mr.
curran
as
well,
but
certainly
as
to
us.
simplot
and
taggares
are
non-registered
persons.
say
they
are
not
amenable
to
the
reparations
procedure.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
the
exchange
isn't,
either,
but
the
exchange
stood
there
and
watched
this
happen
the
facts
are
in
judge
friendly's
record.
they
could
have
stopped
it
nine
days
earlier,
and
so
could
the
cftc,
but
they
let
it
go
on,
and--
mr.
leonard
toboroff
--there
is
not.
there
is
not.
mr.
leist
could
not
go
and
sue
the
exchange
for
the
half
million
dollars
or
so
that
he
lost.
he
could
not
go
to
reparations
and
sue
simplot
and
taggares.
that
is
a
laugh,
as
far
as
they
are
concerned.
they
are
sitting
around,
waiting
to
see
how
this
decision
comes
down.
they
haven't
manipulated
any
potato
markets
since
judge
friendly's
decision,
but
they
did
manipulate
one
back
in
1971,
on
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange,
in
the
same
fashion.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
given
all
of
the...
there
was
no
lawsuit
brought
for
that
one,
but
given
all
of
these
circumstances,
the
slate
that
congress
was
writing
on,
and
the
reparations
question
is
a
heavy
question
because
it
has
been
decided
up
and
down.
it
is
a
remedy
that
supplants
private
right
of
action.
actually,
it
was
an
addition
to
it,
and
that
is
clear
from
the
testimony
in
the
house
and
the
senate,
the
hearings
in
the
senate.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
the
only
thing
that
the
plaintiffs
had
were
access
to
reparations,
they
would
have
nothing.
simplot
and
taggares,
any
major
market
manipulator
could
manipulate
a
market
and
just
go
away
scot
free,
and
nothing
could
be
done.
there
would
be
no
right...
if
there
were
no
right
of
action
against
them
in
the
united
states
court
under
the
commodity
exchange
act,
there
would
be
nothing
left.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
that
is
because
they
are
not
registered,
and
that
is
because
congress
didn't
choose
to
register
them,
because
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
against
them.
congress
chose
to
register
people
and
supplier
registration...
reparations
remedy
much
in
what
the
solicitor
general's
brief
for
the
cftc
calls
a
small
claims
procedure,
quick,
to
the
point,
expeditious.
that
hasn't
happened,
either,
but
that
is
not
the
point.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
my
point
is,
they
applied
a
private
remedy
in
1974
the
way
the
private
remedies
were
applied.
they
couldn't
know
in
1974
that
there
would
be
the
1979
triad,
and
that
the
court
would
now
be
wrestling
at
the
end
of
the
1981
term...
1980
term,
pardon
me,
and
the
beginning
of
the
1981
term
with
the
question.
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
this
is
the
first
commodity
case.
this
is
a
sui
generis
case.
this
does
not
go
to
the...
has
no
close
analogue
to
the
six
or
seven
recent
decisions
since
the
1979
triad.
they
have
some
analogue
in
that
they
are
securities
cases,
although
there
was
no...
there
was
a
blank
slate
on
those
and
they
were
considering
acts
in
1934
or
1940
that
were
well
prior
to
the
expansion
era
of
undertaking
the
judicial
implication
which
started,
as
i
think
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
in
1946
with
the
cardon
case,
and
reached
full
flower
with
borak,
but
if
you
take
borak
as
the
starting
point,
1964,
and
go
from
borak
to
cort
against
ash
in
1975,
those
eleven
years,
you
have
those
eleven
years,
and
you
have
a
situation
like
the
commodity
statute,
where
you
have
a
50-year
history,
and
where
you
have
an
unbroken
chain
of
decisions...
whether
they
are
right
or
wrong,
congress
is
aware
of
those
decisions,
and
you
have
those
two
items
when
congress
sits
down
in
those
eleven
years.
it
is
a
sui
generis
case.
it
is
just,
as
i
said,
miles
apart
from
the
recent
decisions.
this
is
the
only
chance
that
the
court
has
to
apply
its
standards
to
this
particular
act,
naturally,
because
this
is
the
only
case,
these
two
cases,
but...
these
consolidated
cases
for
which
i
am
arguing
here
have
broader
questions
than
simply
4b.
mr.
leonard
toboroff
i...
changed
the
law?
they
narrowed
the
standards,
is
what
they
did.
yes,
if
congress
sat
down...
not
cort
v.
ash
specifically,
because
after
cort
v.
ash,
your
honor
noted
in
cannon
in
your
dissent
that
there
were,
i
think
20
was
the
number,
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
had
implied
private
rights
of
action.
it
really
wasn't
until
1979.
certainly
in
1975
after
the
cort
against
ash
decision,
some
smart
congressional
staffers
could
have
perked
up
their
ears
and
written
a
little
better,
but
i
think
if
i
were
standing
here
and
talking
about
a
1976
statute,
i
would
be
trying
to
stretch
it
to
1979,
is
what
i
am
saying,
but
i
don't
have
to
do
that.
i
got...
i
am
in
before
cort
against
ash.
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
that
the
exchanges
are
here
today
really
asking
for
a
little
bit
of
judicial
exculpation...
exculpation
by
way
of
judicial
legislation
from
something
that
congress
wouldn't
give
them
in
1974
when
it
switched
its
theory
from
self-regulation,
from
fox
in
the
chicken
coop
self-regulation
to
compulsory
regulation,
and
i
think
that
based
on
all
of
the
cases,
based
on
the
standards
as
they
exist
today,
enunciated
here,
the
court
has
to
conclude
that
judge
friendly
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
