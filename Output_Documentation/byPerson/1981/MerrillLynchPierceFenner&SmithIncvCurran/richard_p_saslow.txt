mr.
richard
p.
saslow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
commodity
exchange
act
provides
persons
such
as
the
currans
an
implied
right
to
maintain
a
civil
action
for
damages
under
section
4,
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
act
in
federal
court.
in
a
broader
sense,
the
issue
is
where
is
the
line
to
be
drawn
that
distinguishes
between
the
proper
scope
of
judicial
function
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
statutory
language,
and
what
the
constitution
defines
to
be
the
legislative
prerogative,
the
enactment
of
substantive
rights
and
federal
statutes.
very
briefly,
the
facts
are
that
the
currans
opened
a
commodity
trading
account
with
merrill
lynch
in
1973.
the
account
was
closed
about
a
year
later,
having
sustained
substantial
losses.
the
currans
started
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
claiming
civil
damages
alleged
to
have
been
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
fraud
of
merrill
lynch.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
addressed
sua
sponte
and
decided
the
issue
of
whether
the
statute
creates
this
implied
remedy.
over
the
dissent
of
judge
philips,
the
court
concluded
that
there
is
such
a
remedy.
the
currans'
claim
is
based
on
section
4b
of
the
commodity
exchange
act,
a
1936
statute.
the
1936
act
was
broadly
proscriptive,
provided
for
criminal
sanctions,
and
granted
some
regulatory
powers
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
there
was
no
provision
in
that
act
for
any
private
remedy
in
federal
courts.
there
was
no
language
in
the
statute
creating
such
a
right,
and
there
was
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
ever
considered,
contemplated,
or
intended
the
existence
of
such
a
right.
the
1936
act
contained
section
4c,
savings
clause,
which
preserved
to
persons
any
rights
or
remedies
they
might
have
under
applicable
state
law.
the
commodity
exchange
act
was
amended
in
1968,
very
substantially
in
1974,
and
again
thereafter
in
1978.
the
1974
amendment
significantly
broadened
and
strengthened
the
regulatory
control
of
the
government
over
this
sector
of
the
economy.
the
1974
amendments
created
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission,
which
was
designed
to
be
an
expert
agency
with
broad
administrative,
regulatory,
and
enforcement
and
remedial
powers.
the
commission
was
vested
with
the
oversight
of
contract
markets,
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
contract
markets,
was
given
power
to
enforce
with
cease
and
desist
orders
the
terms
of
the
act.
it
engages
in
the
registration
and
licensing
of
persons
active
in
this
industry.
it
has
the
power
to
revoke
and
suspend
licenses
and
registration
for
violations
of
the
act.
the
commission
has
the
power
to
impose
civil
penalties
of
up
to
$100,000,
and
to
pursue
criminal
prosecutions,
with
penalties
ranging
up
to
$500,000
for,
among
other
things,
willful
violation
of
the
section
at
issue
here,
the
antifraud
provisions,
section
4b.
the
1974
amendments
also
repealed
the
state
law
savings
clause,
provided
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
futures
trading
and
related
activities
in
the
commission,
and
also
set
up
an
administrative
reparation
procedure
by
which
aggrieved
persons
such
as
the
currans
could
pursue
a
civil
damage
remedy
before
the
commission.
the
act
did
not
in
1936
nor
in
1974
nor
at
any
other
time
contain
any
language
granting
a
person
a
right
to
sue
for
civil
damages
in
the
united
states
district
court
alleging
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
currans
are
asking
in
effect
that
the
court
correct
this
congressional
oversight.
they
ask
that
the
court--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
we
take
the
position
that
congress
acted
purposefully,
that
it
is
being
characterized
by
the
respondents
as
an
oversight.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
they
argue
that
there
was
an
existing
private
right
of
action.
we
dispute
that
there
ever
was.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
yes,
it
would
still
be
an
omission
from
the
statute
that
is
purposeful.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
if
that
were
the
situation,
no,
but
the--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--but
the
legislative
history
simply
doesn't
bear
that
out.
congress
was
in
fact
presented
with
testimony
saying,
if
you
provide
these
reparation
proceedings,
you
must
also
include
express
language
creating
a
civil
damages
remedy
in
federal
court
or
else--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--what
the
respondents
are
asking
in
effect,
though,
is
that
the
court
ignore
the
years
of
debate,
hearings,
testimony,
drafting,
enactment,
amendment
that
underlie
the
formation
of
this
act
since
1936
and
which
represents
a
reasoned
policy
decision
on
the
part
of
congress
as
to
what
rights
and
remedies
should
be
contained
within
the
act.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
since
1936
devoted
considerable
attention,
time,
effort,
and
draftsmanship
to
the
creation
of
the
commodity
exchange
act.
yet
the
respondents
would
ask
this
court
to
disregard
that
congressional
effort
in
this
very
key
provision
and
substitute
the
wisdom
of
this
court
for
that
of
the
congress
as
to
whether
this
substantive
right,
this
private
right
of
action,
should
exist
under
this
statute.
what
respondents
ask
in
effect
is
for
the
court
to
exceed
its
judicial
function
and
venture
into
the
realm
of
the
legislative
function.
this
court
recently
in
texas
industries
versus
radcliffe
materials
had
occasion,
speaking
through
the
chief
justice,
to
discuss
the
fact
that
the
creation
of
substantive
rights
is
a
legislative
function.
the
court
noted
that
it
is
the
congress
that
is
equipped
to
make
these
kinds
of
policy
decisions.
for
example,
in
the
consideration
that
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
commodity
exchange
act,
the
congress
heard
testimony
from
witnesses
representing
many
diverse
segments
within
the
futures
trading
industry.
this
testimony,
the
hearings
amounted
to
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pages
of
legislative
history,
and
represented
the
accumulation
by
the
congress
of
information,
of
the
interests,
the
opinions,
the
desires
of
all
of
these
many
groups.
the
decision
of
the
congress
as
to
how
those
many
and
often
diverse
interests
could
best
be
balanced
and
mutually
served,
and
how
the
futures
industry
and
the
national
economy
could
best
be
served
through
this
act
is
set
forth
in
the
language,
the
provisions
that
the
congress
put
into
the
commodity
exchange
act.
the
framers
of
our
constitution
determined
that
such
policy
decisions
are
to
be
made
by
elected
representatives,
those
who
are
politically
accountable
to
their
constituents.
the
judicial
forum
is
unsuited
to
the
making
of
such
policy
decisions.
courts
are
limited
to
the
facts
presented
to
them
by
individual
litigants
in
an
adversary
posture.
the
court
does
not
have
free
ranging
source
of
information
to
make
such
decisions.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
it
does
not
direct
their
obligation
to
anyone
in
particular.
it
simply
prohibits
their
committing
fraud
or
deceit.
i
believe
the
focus
of
section
4b
is
expressed
in
the
1936
enactment,
and
notwithstanding
that
the
respondents
seek
to
look
for
congressional
intent
in
the
1974
amendments,
it
must
be
remembered
that
section
4b
was
enacted
in
1936,
and
has
been
on
the
books
since
that
time,
notwithstanding
the
amendment
of
other
provisions
of
the
act.
and
in
1936,
the
congress
was
focusing
on
the
protection
of
farmers,
producers,
people
who
handle
the
commodities,
to
protect
those
people
from
the
abuses
of,
among
others,
speculators.
the
idea
was
the
protection
of
the
marketplace
and
of
the
agricultural
segment
of
the
economy
from
manipulation,
excessive
speculation,
and
other
abuses
in
the
futures
market.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
yes,
they
were.
speculators
as
opposed
to
hedgers,
who
are
people
who
have
an
interest
in
the
cash
commodity
itself
and
are
trying
to
abate
the
risk.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
that's
right.
the
role
of
statutory
construction
traditionally
involves
the
resolution
of
ambiguities
in
the
statute,
the
efforts
of
the
judicial
branch
to
harmonize
apparent
conflicts
between
different
provisions
within
a
statute,
or
the
task
of
harmonizing
apparent
conflicts
between
different
statutes,
and
the
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts
of
an
individual
case.
where,
as
in
this
case,
the
statute
itself
is
clear,
the
court
need
only
consider
the
language
and
the
structure
of
the
act
to
answer
the
question,
and
the
answer
to
the
question
here
is
that
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
contained
within
the
statute.
therefore,
none
exists.
this
court's
recent
decisions
have
emphasized
these
limitations
on
the
judicial
role
in
the
implication
of
private
rights--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
do
not
believe
that
the
federal
state
pre-emption
issue
is
before
the
court
in
this
case,
but
i
do
believe--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--yes.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
that
states
my
understanding--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--of
the
effect
of
the
act.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
no,
justice
powell,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--we
expressed
that
position
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
justice
powell,
i
was
addressing
an
argument
made
by
the
respondents
that
their
cause
of
action
accrued
prior
to
the
date
after
which
reparations
would
be
available
to
them.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
the
pre-emptive
effect
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
act
arises
in
the
1974
amendments.
prior
to
that
time
there
was
a
savings
clause
in
the
statute
that
reserved
state
remedies
to
litigants.
that
savings
clause
was
deleted
in
1974,
and
the
reparation
proceedings
were
made
available
at
the
same
time.
so,
in
addressing
this,
the
argument
of
the
petitioners,
we
say
regardless
of
when
their
claim
accrued,
and
that
has
never
been
determined
in
this
case,
if
it
was
before
the
effective
date
of
the
1974
amendments,
they
would
have
available
a
state
court
remedy;
if
it
were
afterward,
they
would
have
direct
reparation
remedy
before
the
commission.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
only
if
their
claim
as
they
now
say
accrued
prior
to
the
availability
of
reparation.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
well,
it
was
not
their
claim
in
the
court
below.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
we
were
addressing
an
argument
that
they
made
that
if
this
court
does
not
grant
a
private
right
of
action
in
the
federal
courts,
they
would
be
without
any
remedy
whatever,
and
in
addressing
that
point
we
just
say
that
they
have
one
or
the
other
depending
on
when
their
claim
accrued.
this
court's
recent
decisions
have
stressed
the
limitations
on
the
judicial
role
in
the
implication
of
private
rights
under
statutes
that
don't
expressly
provide
those
rights.
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
it
cannot
infer
a
private
remedy
under
such
a
statute
in
the
absence
of
clear,
persuasive
evidence
that
such
was
the
intent
of
the
congress,
yet
the
evidence
that
the
respondents
rely
on
in
this
case
is
evidence
of
the
sort
that
this
court
has
rejected
as
being
probative
of
the
existence
of
a
private
remedy.
the
respondents
argue
that
this
is
a
comprehensive
regulatory
statute
providing
various
means
of
enforcement
and
redress.
they
argue
further
that
it
is
the
apparent
will
of
the
congress
to
provide
strong
enforcement,
and
therefore
it
would
advance
that
same
congressional
purpose
for
the
court
to
imply
an
additional
form
of
remedy.
this
court
has,
however,
held
otherwise,
acknowledging
that
when
there
is
a
comprehensive,
broad
statute
providing
for
varied
remedies,
it
creates
a
presumption
that
the
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
and
enacted
those
remedies
that
it
intended,
and
remained
silent
as
to
those
remedies
that
it
did
not
intend.
the
commodity
exchange
act
at
various
provisions
expressly
provides
for
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
court
to
contribute
to
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
the
courts
are
given
jurisdiction
over
the
cease
and
desist
actions
of
the
commission.
they
are
given
enforcement
of
commission
orders.
the
enforcement
and
appellate
review
of
reparation
awards
is
expressly
placed
in
the
federal
courts.
obviously,
as
this
court
has
noted,
when
congress
wishes
to
provide
a
remedy,
it
knows
how
to
do
so
and
does
so
expressly.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
from
an
award
of
no
damages?
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
there
are
two
situations
in
which
that
can
happen,
justice
stevens.
there
is
an
initial
determination
made
upon
the
filing
of
the
complaint
whether
the
complaint
has
sufficient
merit
to
go
any
further.
i
understand
that
that
decision
is
not
reviewable.
if
the
proceeding
does
continue,
and
there
is
the
hearing,
and
the
award
is
that
there
are
no
damages,
no
cause
of
action,
then
that
determination,
in
my
understanding,
is
reviewable.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
they
are
heard
by
an
administrative
law
judge
who
has
broad
adjudicative
powers,
not
too
dissimilar
to
the
federal
courts.
there
are
provisions
for
discovery,
representation
by
counsel,
and
so
forth.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
am
not
familiar
enough
with
those
mechanics
to--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
do
not
know
if
the
reparation
proceedings
provide
in
fact
for
class
action,
but
if
it
were
an
individual
proceeding,
it
would
proceed
not
unlike
a
normal
individual
piece
of
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
an
award,
it
is
enforceable
individually
against
the
respondent,
and
it
is
enforceable
in
the
federal
courts
with
the
normal
execution
remedies.
in
addition,
the
trading
privileges
of
a
respondent
who
doesn't
pay
an
award
ordered
by
the
commission
are
automatically
suspended.
it
is
argued
by
the
respondents
that
section
4b
was
enacted
for
the
especial
benefit
of
customers
such
as
themselves,
and
that
therefore
a
private
right
of
action
should
be
implied.
this
argument
is
unavailing
for
two
reasons.
the
first
of
those
reasons
is
that
it
is
factually
incorrect.
as
i
discussed
a
few
minutes
ago,
the
protection
was
directed
to
the
marketplace
in
general,
and
to
the
extent
there
was
any
particular
favored
class,
it
was
basically
the
farmers.
the
argument
is
also
legally
insufficient.
even
if
people
such
as
the
respondents
were
a
favored
class
at
whom
the
statute's
benefits
were
aimed,
that
still
is
insufficient
to
create
a
substantive
right
to
proceed
in
the
federal
courts.
the
respondents
also
seek
to
invoke
the
holdings
of
approximately
four
united
states
district
courts
that
recognize
an
implied
right
of
action,
using
the
tort
pro
se
analysis
of
rigsby
and
borak,
an
analysis
that
this
court
has
since
categorically
rejected
in
touche
ross
and
transamerica.
it
is
argued
that
the
congress
was
aware
of,
approved
of,
and
in
effect
adopted
these
decisions,
and
now
this
court
is
debarred
from
taking
that
away
since
it
is
not
said
to
represent
a
congressional
enactment.
this
argument
is
factually
incorrect
and
constitutionally
unsound.
it
is
factually
incorrect
because
it
is
simply
not
supportable
that
the
congress
as
a
whole
was
aware
of,
spent
any
time
considering,
or
acted
in
reliance
on
the
existence
of
a
right
found
by
these
four
courts
in
illinois,
minnesota,
louisiana,
and
pennsylvania.
the
decisions
were
constitutionally
unsound
and
congress
was
simply
not
well
aware
of
them.
there
are
hundreds
of
pages
of
legislative
history
underlying
the
1974
amendments,
and
there
are
a
very
few,
very
scattered,
some
ambiguous,
some
clearly
perjorative
references
to
these
cases,
but
there
is
nothing
that
focuses
on
them
and
represents
any
congressional
intent
recognizing
this
to
be
the
law
or
establishing
an
intent
that
this
shall
be
the
law
upon
the
adoption
of
these

the
district
courts
cannot
create
substantive
rights.
again,
it
is
a
congressional
function.
they
can
recognize,
they
can
infer
that
which
congress
has
sufficiently
implied
to
them,
but
they
can't
create
it
out
of
whole
cloth,
as
these
courts
did
honoring
rigsby
and
borak.
to
follow
this
argument
of
the
respondents--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
think
borak
was
incorrectly
decided
under
the
principles
this
court
has
established
since
that
time.
i
think
rigsby
relied
on
an
incorrect
premise,
but
i
think
rigsby
might
have
nonetheless
been
correctly
decided
even
under
the
court's
current
principles.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
well,
my
argument
is
that
the
court
cannot
say
that
this
statute
creates
a
duty,
that
duty
has
been
breached,
this
plaintiff
has
been
injured,
therefore
he
has
a
right
to
proceed
in
federal
court
for
a
damage
remedy.
i
think
this
court
has
in
recent
terms
held
that
that
can't
be
done.
what
can
constitutionally
be
done
is
for
the
court
to
resolve
ambiguities
and
infer
in
some
cases
a
right
of
action
even
where
none
is
expressly
provided.
in
rigsby,
for
example,
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
safety
and
appliance
act
at
issue
in
that
case
said
that
employees
shall
not
be
deemed
to
have
assumed
the
risk.
a
provision
that
takes
away
a
legal
defense
would
seem
to
create
a
reasonable
inference
that
that
defense
must
be
able
to
be
asserted
in
some
forum,
and
i
think
there
might
be
an
inference
to
be
drawn
there
that
a
private
right
of
action
was
intended.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
think
that
cort
v.
ash
has
been
leading
the
lower
courts
astray,
the
consideration--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--the
result
is;
the
reasoning
is
probably
unnecessary
in
many
cases.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
yes,
justice
white,
it
is.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
no,
not
at
all.
i
don't
believe
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
think
under
the
test
that
cort
v.
ash
establishes,
there
is
no
private
right
of
action.
i
think
the
degree
of
inquiry
that
is
required
by
cort
v.
ash
is
unnecessary
in
a
case
where
there
is
not
some
indication
within
the
statute
that
there
might
have
been
a
private
right
intended.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
believe--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
don't
believe
that
to
decide
the
case
in
my
favor
the
court
needs
to
rewrite
cort
v.
ash.
i
do
think
that--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--because
i
think
that
the--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
recognize
that.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
because,
justice
powell,
when
the
courts
are
invited,
as
cort
v.
ash
invites
them,
to
consider
whether
an
additional
private
right
of
action
would
advance
the
congressional
purpose,
the
courts
are
then
invited
to
try
to
form
a
subjective
intent
or
a
subjective
idea
of
what
the
congressional
purpose
is
and
whether
this
additional
remedy
might
advance
it,
and
i
believe
they
are
led
into
making
legislative
policy
decisions
of
the
kind
that
should
be
made
by
elected
representatives.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
could
say
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
am
in
effect
relying
on
is
that
that
is
the
determination
that
the
congress
made,
and
that
that
is
properly
a
congressional
decision
to
make.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
and
that
is
all
that
they
intended.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
well,
they
are
part
of
the
enactment
that
congress
chose.
the
congress
was
presented--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--no,
i
am
arguing
that
there
was
never
a
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
courts,
and
after
1974
there
was
also
a
remedy
in
reparation
and
no
remedy
in
state
court.
but
there
was
never
a
right
of
action
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
all
right.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
would
argue
that
there
is
still
no
private
right
of
action.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
no,
i
am
arguing
that
there
was
never
a
right
of
action
in
the
federal
courts.
there
was
a
right
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
i
would
say
that
a
right
of
action
still
has
to
be
affirmatively
created
by
the
congress.
if
there--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--yes,
that's
right.
it
was.
and
the
right
of
action
in
the
courts
was
not.
that
was
a
congressional
decision,
a
choice.
and
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
judges
to--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
think
that
stands--
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
--i
think
the
question
posed
by
the
sixth
circuit
turns
articles
i
and
iii
on
their
ear.
mr.
richard
p.
saslow
and
by
the
second
circuit
as
well.
thank
you.
