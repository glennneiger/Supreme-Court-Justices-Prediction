mr.
robert
a.
hudson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
making
the
determination
of
whether
a
private
right
of
action
exists
under
the
commodity
exchange
act,
the
opinions
of
this
court
instruct
that
the
touchstone
is
congressional
intent.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
relevant
inquiry
is
whether
congress
in
enacting
the
substantive
and
extensive
amendments
to
the
commodity
exchange
act
in
1974
intended
to
deny
a
private
right
of
action
under
section
4b.
we
believe
this
approach
to
be
the
correct
one
in
view
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
enactment
of
the
1974
legislation,
circumstances
which
show
that
based
on
the
unanimous
interpretation
of
section
4b
by
the
federal
courts
and
based
upon
the
testimony
provided
to
congress,
and
statements
made
by
our
legislators,
congress
perceived
that
the
act
afforded
a
private
right
of
action.
thus
stated,
we
believe
that
the
opinion
below
did
not,
as
this
court
cautioned
in
northwest
airlines
versus
united
states,
fashion
a
new
rule
or
provide
a
new
remedy
which
congress
decided
not
to
adopt,
but
instead
merely
interpreted
a
statute
as
continuing
an
existing
remedy.
we
believe
the
attempt
to
couch
this
case
in
constitutional
terms
is
in
fact
to
beg
the
very
question
that
we
have
before
the
court,
and
exalt
the
proper
exercise
of
this
court's
duty
in
interpreting
a
statute
far
beyond
its
plain
import.
this
court
has
stated
on
numerous
occasions
that
in
construing
a
statute
we
look
first
to
the
statutory
language,
and
particularly
to
the
provisions
made
therein
for
enforcement
and
relief.
while
as
in
nearly
every
case
involving
an
implied
right
of
action,
there
is
no
explicit
statutory
language
which
would
answer
this
question
for
us,
we
believe
the
explicit
terms
of
the
statute
are
particularly
telling
of
congressional
intent
in
this
case.
section
4b
is
a
customer-oriented
antifraud
statute,
very
much
like
section
10b
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
interpreted
by
this
court
in
superintendent
of
insurance,
and
sections
206
and
215
of
the
investment
advisors
act,
considered
in
transamerica
mortgage
advisors.
the
very
language
of
section
4b
makes
it
clear
that
a
commodity
broker's
customers
are
the
especial
class
intended
to
be
benefitted
by
that
statute.
in
leist
against
simplot,
judge
mansfield
in
his
dissenting
opinion
correctly
observed
that
it
is
only
a
customer
who
may
bring
a
suit
under
section
4b.
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
find
significant
support
in
the
legislative
history,
which
shows
that
customer
protection
was
one
of
the,
if
not
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
legislation.
however,
as
this
court
has
cautioned
in
california
versus
sierra
club,
the
question
is
not
simply
whether...
who
would
benefit,
but
whether
congress
intended
to
confer
federal
rights
upon
those
beneficiaries.
as
to
this
issue,
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
are
not
in
disagreement,
because
as
petitioner
states
in
his
brief,
there
is
no
reason
for
a
court
to
speculate
whether
congress
intended
that
persons
aggrieved
by
violations
of
the
act
be
entitled
to
recover
damages.
plainly,
congress
did
so
intend.
and
that
intention
is
specified
in
the
express
terminology
of
the
statute.
sections
5a(11)
and
section
14
of
the
act
create
respectively
a
private,
voluntary
arbitration
mechanism
and
an
administrative
reparations
procedure
to
commodity
customers
injured
for
a
broker's
violation
of
section
4b.
thus,
we
believe
the
express
terms
of
the
statute,
without
regard
to
any
other
factors,
conclusively
demonstrate
that
congress
enacted
a
federal
statute
conferring
federal
duties
upon
commodity
brokers
toward
their
customers,
and
that
congress
intended
that
customers
would
have
recourse,
civil
recourse
for
violations
of
that
statute.
yet
based
upon
the
record
as
submitted
to
this
court,
and
we
want
to
make
that
clear,
the
record
supports,
and
we
contend,
that
the
claim
of
the
currans
arose
before
the
effective
date
of
the
reparations
procedure.
under
those
facts,
no
remedy
is
provided
to
the
currans.
accordingly,
the
remaining
inquiry
of
whether
congress
intended
that
those
rights
to
which
i
have
referred
would
be
supported
through
private
litigation
must
be
determined
by
reference
to
the
language
of
the...
not
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
through
congressional
intent
and
the
factors
reflecting
that
intent,
as
this
court
has
outlined
in
cort
against
ash.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
justice
blackmun,
i
believe
there
is
no
dispute.
the
comment
has
been
made
that
possibly
their
claim
arose
during
a
time
when
they
could
use
reparations.
we
contest
that
vigorously.
i
believe
that
it
was
correctly
observed
earlier
that
the
petitioners
are
suggesting
that
the
currans
be
sent
to
state
court.
they
simply,
in
our
view,
cannot
use
reparations
and
they
cannot
use
arbitration.
we
believe,
therefore,
that
it
would
be
useful
to
take
a
look
very
quickly
to
what
precisely
congress
did
in
1974
with
the
commodity
exchange
act.
in
1974,
19
new
sections
were
enacted;
27
sections
were
amended;
and
excluding
the
severability
clause,
only
five
sections
were
left
undisturbed.
section
4b
was
one
of
the
sections
that
was
amended,
yet
the
operative
language
upon
which
the
respondents
rely
was
left
completely
intact.
the
changes
to
the
1974
act...
in
the
1974
legislation
constituted
a
vast
change
in
the
scheme
of
legislation,
and
expansion
of
federal
regulation,
and
in
the
means
of
providing
redress
for
the
violations.
so,
we
believe,
based
on
that
very
extensive
modification,
that
the
intent
to
be
discerned
is
the
intent
of
the
1974
congress.
this
is
a
point
which
every
court
which
has
considered
this
issue
thus
far
has
made.
in
considering
what
the
1974
congress
intended
with
regard
to
claims
like
the
currans',
we
must
recognize
that
when
congress
sat
down
to
amend
the
statute,
it
was
the
unanimous
interpretation
of
the
lower
federal
courts
that
a
private
right
of
action
was
allowed
under
section
4b.
petitioner
is
unable
to
point
to
one
single
decision
that
even
suggests
that
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
result.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
no,
there
was
not,
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
the
discussions
in
the
1974
congress
did
not
get
into
the
specifics
in
terms
of
the
cases
that
were
decided,
however,
we
believe
that
even
without
that,
we
believe
that
the
conclusion
which
the
court
reached
in
cannon
versus
university
of
chicago,
which
was
that...
the
statement
was
made
that
our
legislators
are
presumed
to
know
the
law,
in
addition
to
that
general
presumption,
there
was
a
significant
amount
of
testimony
which
was
presented
and
which
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief
which
shows
that
congress
was
told
that
there
was
a
right
of
action
in
the
courts.
for
example,
a
statement
by
mr.
alvin
donohue,
of
the
minneapolis
grain
exchange,
to
the
effect
that
the
facts
in
large
claims
can
best
be
established
through
the
procedure--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--this
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
however,
we
believe
that
the
emphasis
which
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
place
on
that
very
fact
is...
overlooks
what
we
believe
to
be
a
very
significant
concept
of
statutory
construction
to
which
this
court
referred
to
in
cannon,
which
is
that
it
is
not
really
the
state
of
the
law
which
is
governing,
it
is
congress's
perception
of
the
state
of
the
law.
whether
or
not
that
perception
is
correct
or
not
is
of
no
moment.
if
congress
perceived
that
that
private
right
of
action
existed,
that
in
fact
is
the
most
significant
indication
of
legislative
intent.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
it
had.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
this
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
the
amtrak
decision
and
the
very,
i
believe,
cogent
questions
that
you
are
pointing
out
must
be
considered,
but
i
think
they
must
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
entire
circumstances.
we
believe
that
we
must
weigh
the
factor
that
you
have
just
mentioned
with
the
fact
that
congress
was
told
on
repeated
occasions
that
customers
could
go
to
court
in
most
instances
by
those
very
individuals
who
were
going
to
be
governed
by
this
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
petitioner
made
that
very
statement
to
congress
himself
in
testimony.
it
is...
therefore,
the
way
that
we
believe
that
factor
is
relevant
is
that
this
court
has
outlined
a
number
of
tools,
accepted
tools
of
statutory
construction
which
must
be
looked
at.
i
think
the
point
that
we
are
making,
there
was
this
line
of
authority,
congress
was
told
that
there
was
recourse
to
the
courts--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--there
was
not.
not
under
section
4b,
justice
white.
it
was
unanimous,
and
in
fact
the
belief,
we
believe,
was
so
universal
that
it
is
even
underscored
by
the
proceedings
below
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
i
perceive,
justice
white,
that
congress
intended
that
they
would
have
a
choice.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
that's
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
contention,
justice
white.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
agrees
with
that,
because
at
the
very--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--yes,
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
that
is
correct.
you
mean
from
the
lower
federal
courts
or--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--in
reparations?
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
yes,
they
go
directly
from
reparations
to
the...
well,
they
go
directly
from
reparations
to
the
commodity
exchange
commission
itself.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
correct.
that's
correct.
then
to
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
no,
i
do
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
we
make
in
support
of
our
contention
that
it
could
not
have
been
intended
to
be
an
exclusive
remedy.
there
are
certain
facets
to
the
way
that
the
reparations
remedy
works
that
we
believe
show
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
an
intention
to
make
it
an
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
no,
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far,
justice
white,
because
after
all,
if--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--well,
if
there
has
been
no
decision,
if
there
has
been
no
appeal--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--correct,
but
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
any
kind
of
decision
on
the
merits,
and
i
don't
believe
it
would
bar--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
it
would.
it
would,
because
reparations,
we
believe,
was
intended
to
provide
an
expeditious
and
inexpensive
alternative
to
court
proceedings.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
this
is
correct.
in
fact,
this
was
the
way
that
the
courts
were
interpreting
the
law
prior
to
the
1974
amendments.
this
is
exactly
what
the
courts
were
doing.
admittedly,
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
had
not
been
created
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
we
believe,
however,
that
if
we
accept
the
premise,
and
we
believe
it
is
adequately
supported
in
the
record,
that
congress
perceived
that
alternative
to
be
available,
then
congress
should
have
spoken
to
that
fact.
congress
would
have
said
something
about
it.
congress
did
not.
and
in
fact,
as
i
have
indicated,
we
believe
the
intent
of
congress
to
perpetuate
the
remedy
is
shown
by
a
study
of
the
mechanism
itself
of
enforcement
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
yes,
i
would,
justice
white.
the
reason
would
be
that--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--i
definitely
would.
the
reason
is
that
we
are
looking
at
a
number
of
factors.
that
is
one
factor.
i
believe
that
because
of
the
existence
of
that
line
of
authority,
because
congress
was
informed
of
it,
we
have
to
consider
that.
if
that
was
not
the
case,
then
i
think
we
would
have
to
pass
that,
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
other
circumstances,
for
example,
the
way
the
reparations
remedy
itself
works.
arbitration,
which
is
one
of
the
remedies
provided,
is
only
allowable
for
claims
below
$15,000,
and
must
in
any
event
be
voluntary,
certainly
not
the
case
if
you
have
no
alternative.
and
the
currans
have
no
alternative
in
this
case,
because
while
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
act,
including
section
4b,
became
effective
on
october
23rd,
1974,
the
reparations
remedy
did
not
become
effective
for
three
months
later,
in
january
of
1975,
and
claims
under
reparations
could
not
be
filed
for
one
year
thereafter,
january,
1976.
so,
while
this
type
of
a
phase-in
may
certainly
be
explainable
in
terms
of
allowing
the
cftc
to
adopt
its
regulations
and
prepare
itself
for
its
duties,
it
is
completely,
we
believe,
had
congress
intended
to
make
that
an
exclusive
remedy,
it
would
have
logically
made
that
available
to
everyone
who
might
come
before
the
commission.
at
the
same
time,
it
strains
credulity
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
immunize
conduct
violative
of
section
4b
during
that
period
prior
to
the
time
that
reparations
would
take
effect.
this,
we
believe,
is
governed
by
the
very
standard
tool
of
statutory
construction
that
an
unreasonable
construction
of
a
statute
should
yield
to
the
reasonable
one.
so,
unless
this
court
upholds
the
existence
of
a
private
right
of
action,
the
currans
will
be
without
any
remedy,
and
we
believe
that
the
duty
which
congress
imposed
upon
the
petitioner
will
become
entirely
precatory,
certainly
not
a
wise
decision,
we
believe.
now,
consideration
of
the
reparations
procedure
itself
shows,
even
if
it
was
available,
shows
that
it
would
not
be
adequate
because
of
the
point
made
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
that
there
is
no
review
of
a
denial
by
the
cftc,
and
in
fact
in
1978
congress
analogized
reparations
as
similar
to
the
operation
of
a
small
claims
court,
certainly
not
the
kind
of
description
that
would
contemplate
an
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
well,
i
would
not
say
that,
justice
rehnquist,
because
certainly
i
believe
that
decisions
by
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
could
be
viewed
as
precedent
and
applied
just
as
decisions
in
the
other
courts.
however,
i
would
point
out
that
with
regard
to
securities
legislation,
while
the
sec
does
not
have
a
customer
remedy
procedure
of
this
nature,
there
are
various
different
courts
interpreting
the
law,
and
certainly
with
regard
to
enforcement
matters
the
sec
is
interpreting
the
law
as
well.
that
has
not
posed
a
problem.
i
don't
believe
it
would
pose
a
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
indeed
it
has,
and
based
certainly
on
some
of
the
decisions,
including
those
that
were
cited
here,
i
believe,
properly,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
congress
has
in
fact
permitted
the
sec
to
perform
a
certain
function
in
that
regard.
it
has
also
permitted
the
courts
to
perform
a
certain
function,
and
i
believe
that
there
has
not
been
an
inconsistency
in
that.
finally,
we
would
like
to
point
out
very
briefly
that
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
1974
legislation,
which
was
customer
protection,
would
clearly
be
frustrated
by
denying
the
currans
the
right
to
pursue
their
claims,
but
in
addition
to
that
there
are
other
ramifications.
for
example,
the
volume
of
cases
with
the
commission
has
become
so
great
that
the
backlog
there
is
now
two
to
three
years.
this
hardly
comports
with
congress's
intent
to
make
the
reparations
remedy
an
expeditious
one.
and--
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
--by
itself,
absolutely
not,
justice
rehnquist,
but
once
again,
we
believe
this
case
presents
a
situation
where
we
have
a
confluence
of
factors
which
we
believe
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
when
considered
all
together
show
that
congress
intended
that
remedy
to
continue.
any
one
of
them
by
themselves,
i
will
readily
concede,
would
not
clearly
show
that
intent,
but
we
believe
that
when
you
have
them
all
together,
you
must
go
forward
and
find
that
there
is
a
right
of
action.
in
johnson
versus
united
states,
which
is
a
case
not
cited
in
our
brief,
justice
holmes,
then
judge
holmes
of
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals,
stated
that
it
is
not
an
adequate
discharge
of
a
court's
duty
to
say,
we
see
what
you
are
driving
at,
but
you
have
not
said
it,
and
therefore
we
will
go
on
as
before.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
that
case,
your
honor,
was
in
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
a.
hudson
well,
i
am
mistaken
then.
i
apologize.
i
think,
however,
the
point
is
certainly
adequate
for
this
case
as
well.
