mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
to
be
decided
by
the
court
is
in
what
forum
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
as
enacted
by
congress
can
a
private
party
obtain
redress
for
alleged
violations
of
the
commodity
exchange
act?
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
against,
in
this
case,
a
futures
commission
merchant,
and
in
the
consolidated
cases
that
we
have
here
also
an
exchange.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
otherwise
stated,
the
issue
is
whether
congress
created
a
private
right
of
action
for
violation
of
the
particular
sections
of
the
commodity
exchange
act.
i
think
first
we
have
to
focus
on
the
statute
as
it
now
exists,
and
see
its
application
to
the
facts
here
at
issue.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
no
party
filed
for
reparations.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
there
is
one.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
my
colleagues
are
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
the
statute
here
expresses
congress's
decision
as
to
how
to
regulate
the
nation's
commodities
and
markets.
to
put
its
decision
into
effect,
we
have
the
commodity
exchange
act.
it
is
a
multi-faceted
regulatory
system.
the
exchanges
regulate
their
members,
including
the
broker
petitioners,
through
their
bylaws,
rules,
and
disciplinary
proceedings.
over
everything,
however,
is
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission.
it
can
compel
the
adoption,
modification,
or
repeal
of
an
exchange's
rules
and
regulations.
it
exercises
oversight
and
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
self-regulatory
entities.
it
is
empowered
to
participate
directly
in
regulatory
and
enforcement
matters,
and
indeed,
it
routinely
does
so.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
the
commission
takes
the
position
that
there
is
none.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
there
is
no
review.
the
provisions
of
the
administrative--
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
believe
it
is.
we
think
that
a
decision
that
there
is
no
reparations
right
is
appealable
to
the
courts
under
both
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
under
fundamental
notions
of
due
process,
if
the
commission
were
to
take
that
view,
which
it
apparently
does.
the
commission
here
has
been
highly
visible
in
what
it
has
done.
the
exchange,
acting
in
its
self-regulatory
role,
held
price
and
penalty
hearings
to
compensate
those
persons
who
had
defaulted,
and
penalized
the
defaulting
parties.
the
business
conduct
committee
of
the
exchange
held
hearings
regarding
violations
of
the
exchange
rules.
the
cftc
conducted
an
extensive
investigation
and
instituted
disciplinary
proceedings
against
the
exchange
and
the
short
sellers,
but
not
against
the
brokers.
our
position
is
that
the
respondents,
had
they
been
so
inclined,
could
have
instituted
reparations
proceedings,
and
upon
proof
of
the
claimed
violations,
obtained
an
award
for
their
damages.
in
short,
the
regulatory
scheme
enacted
by
congress
and
in
place
provides
a
comprehensive
system
for
discipline
of
wrongdoers
and
compensation
of
victims.
now,
let
us
turn
to
the
respondents
who
participated
in
the
market
and
here
claim
damages.
they
claim
they
are
entitled
to
damages
in
a
federal
lawsuit
not
only
on
the
basis
of
the
antitrust
violations
which
they
claim,
but
also
on
the
basis
of
an
implied
private
right
of
action
which
they
contend
are
implicit
in
the
commodity
exchange
act.
we
submit
the
implied
right
of
action
does
not
exist
on
two
bases.
the
first
and
the
controlling
basis
is
that
it
simply
was
not
created
by
congress.
we
believe,
however,
in
case
one
questions
does
this
make
sense,
that
the
fact
of
the
reparations
remedy
explains
but
does
not
control
over
our
position.
the
burden
here
is
on
the
respondents
to
demonstrate
affirmative
congressional
intent
to
create
the
remedy.
none
of
the
respondents
have
done
this,
because
they
can't.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
the
court
decisions
on
the
question
of
the
existence
of
manipulation
are
numerous
and
generally
they
refer
to
it
as
anything
that
the
mind
of
man
can
imagine.
therefore,
the
question
of
what
is
manipulative
is
not
at
all
well
defined.
it
is
not
a
scorecard
where
you
can
go
to
to
check
off
the
indicia
and
say
that
you
have
or
do
not
have
manipulation.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
i
have
not
seen
the
jury
instructions
in
the
cases
that
have
come
out.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
i
am
not
sure.
i
think
it
is
most
difficult
to
actually
prove
a
manipulation
of
a
commodities
market,
because
of
the
fact
you
have
so
many
forces
of
supply
and
demand
meeting.
there
can
be
simple
questions
of
manipulation.
for
example,
the
corner,
where
someone
controls
the
entire
supply,
and
controls
that
supply
other
than
through
a
legal
way.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
everyone
is
attempting
to
participate
in
the
price
discovery
process
by
buying
or
selling
for
a
price
they
determine
to
be
appropriate.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
of
manipulation
of
the
potatoes
market
is
a
very
difficult
factual
question
which
isn't
here.
certainly
the--
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
--from
judge
friendly's
description,
there
were
two
major
forces
moving
in
the
marketplace.
our
client
fortunately
was
not
one
of
them.
it
would
appear
that
they
could
be
characterized
as
manipulation,
but
whether
or
not
that
is
a
proper
legal
conclusion,
i
don't
speak
to
today.
i
think
it
is
a
very
difficult
fact
question,
and
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
the
cftc
exists
is
to
resolve
that
very
difficult
fact
question,
where
they
have
the
advantage
of
the
particular
knowledge
of
what
can
and
cannot
be
manipulative
in
commodities
markets.
in
1936,
congress
passed
a
comprehensive
law
to
regulate
a
marketplace
which
has,
had,
and
continues
to
have
a
major
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
its
concern
was
protecting
the
nation's
economy.
the
language
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
in
1936,
when
the
operative
sections
at
issue
were
passed,
has
not
one
word
suggestive
of
an
intent
to
create
a
right
of
action.
the
legislative
history
likewise
has
not
one
word.
because
of
congressional
concern
that
federal
pre-emption
might
occur
with
respect
to
individual
conduct,
it
preserved
under
section
4c
the
right
to
bring
actions
under
state
law
in
state
courts.
in
1974,
the
commodity
exchange
act
was
amended,
but
it
was
not
re-enacted.
none
of
the
amendments
created
a
private
right
of
action.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1974
amendments
tells
us
nothing
about
any
1974
amendment
which
would
create
a
private
right
of
action.
the
twig
on
which
the
cftc
has
asked
this
court
to
hang
its
hat
is
a
jurisdictional
savings
clause
which,
as
the
touche
case
teaches
us,
cannot
create
a
right
of
action.
the
remaining
legislative
history,
ambiguous
at
best,
tells
us
nothing
except
that
perhaps
a
limited
knowledge
of
what
courts
had
done
between
1936
and
1974,
but
courts
cannot
create
private
rights
of
action.
at
best,
they
can
examine
statutory
language
and
legislative
history
and
find
that
congress
implicitly
created
the
right.
no
court
had
done
that
prior
to
1974.
this
court
has
asked
whether
or
not
cort
v.
ash
compels
a
different
analysis.
i
think
the
court--
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
--i
think
mr.
hegarty's
presentation
of
rigsby
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
rigsby
no
longer
speaks
to
the
current
situation.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
i
think
it
was
wrong.
the
4b
here,
the
court
also
asked
whether
or
not
4b
was
limited,
and
i
think
that
is
very
important
to
this
case.
4b
speaks
to
broker-customer
relations.
it
does
not
speak
to
the
kind
of
relationship
between
the
broker
members
here
and
the
claimants.
they
are
not
customers
of
any
brokers.
and
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
the
crabbed
language
of
4b
is
difficult
to
interpret,
but
i
think
the
only
proper
interpretation
is,
it
reaches
a
broker-customer
claim.
we
have
mentioned
that
we
think
that
reparations
are
important
not
because
they
upheld
the
decision,
but
rather
because
they
respond
to
the
argument
that
is
here
that
there
should
be
a
remedy,
but
our
system
is
one
which
congress
gives
the
remedy.
equally
important,
the
factual
predicate
for
that
argument
is
not
here.
we
think
the
remedy
of
reparations
is
available
to
these
people.
reparations
reaches
persons
registered
and
required
to
be
registered,
and
affords
a
comprehensive
remedy
system
for
violations.
section
13a
of
the
act,
which
already
existed,
reaches
deeply
into
those
associated
with
wrongdoing
and
allows
them
to
be
proceeded
against
as
principals.
as
our
brief
discusses,
we
believe
full
relief
is
available
to
those
injured
by
a
violation
of
the
commodity
exchange
act.
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time
and
use
it
if
necessary.
thank
you.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
stevens,
you
asked
about
the
deaktor
case.
i
think
it
is
important
to
this
court
to
understand
first,
as
has
been
ably
pointed
out,
this
court's
decision
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
private
right
of
action.
that
was
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
it
remanded
it
first
to
the
agency
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
an
action,
presumably
that
would
have
followed
from
that
remand.
mr.
gerard
k.
sandweg,
jr.
it
did
not
order
dismissal.
that
is
correct.
but
the
use
of
deaktor
here
is
to
illuminate
what
congress
knew
when
it
enacted
the
1974
act,
and
our
point
is
that
the
1974
act
and
congress's
knowledge
of
deaktor
in
1974
is
not
relevant
to
this
court's
inquiry
about
this.
the
question
here
is
what
the
congress
did
in
1936
when
it
enacted
the
operative
language
alleged
to
give
rise
to
the
right
of
action.
when
deaktor
was
cited
to
the
court...
to
the
congress
in
1974,
it
was
not
cited
to
congress
to
show
the
existence
of
a
private
right
of
action,
the
purpose
of
it
being
cited
was
to
show
the
application
the
antitrust
laws.
thus,
whatever
the
seventh
circuit
may
have
held,
or
whatever
the
implications
of
this
court's
decision
may
have
been,
they
do
not
give
rise
to
congressional
knowledge
in
1974
even
if
that
knowledge
were
relevant,
which
we
claim
that
is
not.
secondly,
the
question
of
reparations
availability.
we
believe
section
13a
of
the
act
must
be
considered
with
care
in
analyzing
whether
or
not
reparations
are
available
to
persons
in
this
case.
my
own
client
has
had
a
reparations
claim
filed
with
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
which
the
commission
has
forwarded
to
us,
which
is
the
way
the
commission
initiates
the
proceeding,
having
determined
that
the
claim,
so
to
speak,
states
a
claim.
that
is
by
a
non-customer,
just
as
mr.
toboroff's
clients
are
non-customers.
the
reparations
availability
as
to
messrs
simplot
and
taggares
have
to
be
read
under
13a,
which
talks
about
anyone
who
commands,
induces,
et
cetera,
a
violation
of
the
act
is
liable
in
an
administrative
proceeding
as
a
principal.
we
submit
that
reparations
are
an
administrative
proceeding
under
the
act
quite
clearly,
and
therefore
a
person
in
the
character
of
messrs.
simplot
and
taggares,
who
were
alleged
to
have
violated
the
act,
would
be
liable
on
reparations.
in
addition,
much
has
been
made
as
if
mr.
simplot
and
mr.
taggares
had
not
been
punished
by
this
act.
quite
the
contrary
is
true.
the
exchange
imposed
massive
penalties
against
them,
in
addition
to
cftc
imposed
long-term
suspensions
from
trading
on
these
individuals.
moreover,
mr.
toboroff
continues
under
judge
mansfield's
decision
to
have
available
his
antitrust
claims
against
them,
which
remain
pending
in
the
district
court.
thus,
they
were
severely
penalized
under
a
statute
designed
by
congress
to
accomplish
exactly
what
it
accomplished.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
thank
the
court
for
its
indulgence.
