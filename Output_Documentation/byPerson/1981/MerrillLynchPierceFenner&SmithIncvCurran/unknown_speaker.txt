unknown
speaker
do
you
use
that
term
with
precision?
that
is,
that
it
was
an
oversight?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
using
it
in
quotation
marks.
unknown
speaker
their
claim
of
oversight.
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
they
contend
it
was
an
oversight?
they
thought
congress
was
aware
of
the
existing
private
cause
of
action
and
found
no
need
to
enact
it.
isn't
that
their
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
are
right,
then
it
wouldn't
be
an
oversight
that
they
didn't
put
it
in.
unknown
speaker
but
not
an
oversight.
if
they
thought
they
knew...
maybe
they
were
wrong...
that
there
was
an
existing
private
cause
of
action
and
they
didn't
change
the
law
deliberately,
because
they
thought,
we've
already
got
a
remedy,
it
would
not
be
fair
to
call
that
an
oversight,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
your
opponent
argues
is
the
situation
i
know
you
disagree
with
it.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
i
just
merely
was
questioning
whether
it
is
correct
to
say
they
are
relying
on
an
oversight.
that
isn't
as
i
understand
it
their
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
saslow,
does
section
4b
refer
to
the
obligation
of
the
fcms
toward
third
parties
in
the
market
generally,
or
only
to
their
own
customers?
unknown
speaker
were
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
speculators
themselves?
unknown
speaker
by
playing
both
sides,
so
to
speak?
unknown
speaker
mr.
saslow,
may
i
ask,
i
gather
your
basic
position
is
that
at
least
under
the
1974
amendments,
any
redress
has
to
be
obtained
from
the
commission.
there
is
no
state
law
question
here,
i
gather,
is
there?
if
there
is
pre-emption,
it
is
pre-emption
of
any
judicial
remedy
in
the
federal
courts,
and
redress
only
before
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
there
are,
i
gather,
i
think
your
brief
suggests
that
there
may
be
some
ruling
for
state
law
in
the
cases
of
contractual
commercial
rights
and
contracts
for
future
delivery,
but
as
to
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case,
is
it
your
position
that
the
congress
has
specified
that
if
you
have
any
redress
you
have
to
go
to
the
commission
to
get
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
basically
your
position.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
didn't
you
say
in
your
reply
brief
that
the
currans
would
have
a
cause
of
action
for
fraud
under
michigan
law?
or
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
so?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
am
looking
at
the
wrong
brief.
well,
on
page
2
of
your
reply
brief,
you
say
respondents
could
sue
for
fraud
in
state
court
under
the
common
law
of
michigan.
is
it
the
yellow
brief?
am
i
looking
at
the
right
one?
0--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--doesn't
that
modify
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan?
aren't
you
saying,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
these
respondents
would
have,
unless
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
a
fraud
action
in
the
michigan
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
their
claim,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
saslow,
is
there
a
review...
i
can't
remember...
of
the
denial
of
reparations?
unknown
speaker
if
the
commission
says,
you
are
not
entitled
to
anything,
does
the
complaining
party
have
right
of
review
of
that?
unknown
speaker
if
reparations
are
granted,
how
are
they
administered?
unknown
speaker
would
the
function
be
somewhat
like
the
distributions
in
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
a
fund
is
recovered
for
a
class,
it
is
impounded
by
the
courts
and
then
administratively
it
is
parcelled
out
or
available
to
the
people,
the
members
of
the
class
who
have
elected
to
come
in.
unknown
speaker
you
contend,
of
course,
that
both
rigsby
and
borak
were
incorrectly
decided,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
under
your
more
or
less
constitutional
argument
that
the
court
has
no
power
to
do
this,
it
seems
to
me
rigsby
is
clearly
wrong.
unknown
speaker
what
about
cort
against
ash?
do
you
think
that
is
acceptable
to
you?
unknown
speaker
is
that
consistent
with
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
do
you
think
cort
v.
ash
is
consistent
with
your
approach?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
inconsistent
with
your
approach.
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
were
going
to
take
your
approach,
we
would
have
to
tear
up
cort
against
ash
and
all
the
cases
that
have
followed
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
argue
in
your
brief
that
cort
and
ash
was
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
were
going
to
take
your
approach,
we
would
have
to
considerably
modify
the
cort
v.
ash
approach.
unknown
speaker
we
might
get
the
same
results
in
various
cases
that
you
would,
and
some
not,
but
we
would
have
to
do
a
little
rewriting.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
criticize
cort
v.
ash?
unknown
speaker
we
have
not
overruled
cort
v.
ash,
and
we
have
decided
four
or
five
cases
since
then
applying
it.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
question
it?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
you
just
say,
this
would
be
a
very
easy
case
under
cort
v.
ash?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
you
might
have.
because
the
factors
are
not
satisfied
for
implication,
you
think.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
depend
on
the
fact
that
these
huge
potential
penalties
against
a
broker
and
criminal
sanctions
are
going
to
keep
them
in
line.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
that
is
all
they
intended.
that
is
your
argument,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
are
any
reparations,
they
are
incidental.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
basically,
mr.
saslow,
aren't
you
arguing
as
you
answered
me
earlier,
that
what
they
did
in
1974
was
to
say
reparation
shall
be
a
remedy
and
you
will
get
it
before
the
commission,
and
you
don't
have
any
cause
of
action
in
the
courts,
in
the
federal
courts?
isn't
that
what
you
are
arguing?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
however
much
you
argue
to
the
contrary,
this
court
or
some
court
said,
well,
at
the
time
the
1974
statute
was
amended,
prior
to
those
amendments
there
was
a
well
recognized
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
courts.
at
least
the
federal
courts
had
been
adjudicating
private
causes
of
action
under
4b.
let's
just
assume
that
is
true.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
would
you
say
then?
and
let's
assume
the
legislative
history
were
clear
that
congress
recognized
that
those
causes
of
action
had
been
implied
by
the
courts,
and
did
nothing,
were
absolutely
quiet
about
it,
except
to
recognize
it.
unknown
speaker
because
the
1974
reparations
remedy
displaced
the
old
cause
of
action.
isn't
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
accepting
justice
white's
premise,
that
there
was,
then
what
would
you
say,
was
his
question
to
you.
unknown
speaker
the
reparations
action
was.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
you
think
it
poses
the
wrong
question,
to
say
like
the
sixth
circuit
did
or
the
second
circuit
that
the
real
question
here
is
whether
congress
intended
to
eliminate
an
existing
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
the
question
should
be
whether
they
intended
to
create
one.
unknown
speaker
and
by
the
second
circuit,
too?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
dispute
about
that
with
your
opposition,
as
to
whether
there
is
a
remedy
for
the
currans
under
this
section?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
hudson,
in
the
case
of
georgia
against
united
states,
decided
about
seven
or
eight
years
ago,
where
the
voting
rights
act
was
renewed,
the
court's
opinion
states
at
page
411,
us
at
page
526,
"after
extensive
deliberations
in
1970
on
bills
to
extend
the
voting
rights
act,
during
which
the
allen
case,
which
had
been
a
matter
of
some
controversy
in
this
court,
was
repeatedly
discussed.
"
"the
act
was
extended
for
five
years
without
any
substantive
modification.
"
"we
can
only
conclude,
then,
that
allen
correctly
interpreted
the
congressional
design
when
it
held
that
the
act
gives
broad
interpretation
of
the
right
to
vote.
"
et
cetera.
now,
was
there
that
kind
of
discussion
in
the
1974
congress?
unknown
speaker
these
were
lower
courts,
not
the
u.
s.
supreme
court,
like
the
allen
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
by
1974,
when
this
congress
acted,
amtrak
had
been
decided,
had
it
not?
unknown
speaker
or
within
a
month
or
so,
and
there
we
had
said
that
it
was
no
longer
open
season
on
private
rights
of
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
any
contrary
authority?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
hudson,
is
it
your
position
then
that
congress
anticipated
these
parallel
remedies
with
respect
to
those
people
who
could
use
reparations?
with
respect
to
them,
did
they
have
a
choice?
or
could
they
go
both
ways
at
once?
unknown
speaker
a
choice,
but
if
they
chose
one
way,
that
was
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
filed
an
action
in
court,
you
couldn't
go
for
reparation?
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
no
primary
jurisdiction
or
no
exclusive
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
i
know
they
do.
i
know
they
do,
and
where
were
the
commodities
decisions
reviewable?
in
the
courts
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
unknown
speaker
from
reparations.
unknown
speaker
and
then
to
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson,
on
that
point,
do
you
agree
that
they
would
have
been
reviewable...
a
denial
of
a
claim
for
reparations
would
have
been
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
that
you
have
a
choice,
but
once
you
have
made
it,
you
are
stuck
with
it.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
file
for
reparations
and
they
refuse
to
entertain
it--
unknown
speaker
--i
gather
you
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
has
been
a
decision
not
to
entertain--
unknown
speaker
--it
certainly
would
have
been
a
choice
of
yours,
though.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
been
a
choice
of
yours
to
seek
reparations
rather
than
court
review.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
congress
anticipated
independent
judgments
by
courts
on
commodities
exchanges
and
with
no
obligation...
if
you
filed
in
the
court
rather
than
go
for
reparations,
the
court
you
filed
in
would
have
no
duty
whatsoever
to
consider
how
the
commodities
exchange
commission
had
construed
its
own
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes.
that's
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
there
had
never
been
a
decision
on
a
private
cause
of
action
under
4b
prior
to
1974.
let's
assume
there
had
never
been
any
judgments.
would
you
still
be
making
the
argument
that
congress...
that
courts
could
imply
cause
of
action
under
4b?
unknown
speaker
in
spite
of
their
provision
of
the
reparations?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
point
is
basically
that
the
cftc
and
the
federal
courts
simply
are
proceeding
on
two
parallel,
never
meeting
plains,
because
neither
of
them
has
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
other.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
sec
has
been
rebuffed
a
number
of
times
in
this
court,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
the
same
line
of
reasoning
would
enable
someone
to
bypass
the
eeoc
and
go
directly
into
court?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
came
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
unknown
speaker
well,
justice
holmes
never
sat
there.
unknown
speaker
wherever
he
sat,
he
said
what
you
said
he
said.
is
that
it?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
mr.
sullivan,
before
you
start,
it
may
help
me
if
you
answer
a
question
or
two
that
i
have
in
mind.
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
we
are
endeavoring
to
ascertain
the
intention
of
congress,
and
the
primary
question
was
congressional
intent
in
1974
when
this
act
was
extensively
amended.
it
seems
to
me
also
that
the
intention
of
congress
in
1936
is
relevant.
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
before
the
1974
act,
that
we
had
decided
cort
v.
ash,
and
you
had
to
apply
cort
v.
ash
to
the
1936
record,
a
record
in
which
there
is
not
a
word
suggesting
an
implied
cause
of
action,
and
the
statute
then
didn't
even
have
a
jurisdictional
savings
clause
comparable
to
the
savings
clause
in
the
acts
of
1933
and
1934
dealing
with
securities
law.
applying
cort
v.
ash
to
the
1936
act,
how
would
the
solicitor
general
have
argued?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
you
agree
with
the
implication
of
my
question
that
after
cort
v.
ash
and
before
the
1974
act,
it
would
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
infer
a
cause
of
action
under
the
1936
act.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
we
agree
on
that.
how
do
you
justify
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
proponents
of
the
view
that
there
is
no
implied
cause
of
action,
understanding
cort
to
have
said,
in
effect,
that
the
lower
courts
that
interpreted
the
1936
act
as
providing
a
cause
of
action
were
wrong?
in
other
words,
if
they
were
wrong,
and
in
effect
you
have
conceded
it
would
be
a
very
close
question,
where
does
the
burden
lie
here
today?
unknown
speaker
by
what
test?
assuming
cort
v.
ash
came
down
prior
to
the
1974
act,
what
test
in
light
of
cort
would
have
sustained
a
private
cause
of
action
being
inferred
on
the
basis
of
the
language,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1936
act?
unknown
speaker
but
4b
has
not
been
changed.
unknown
speaker
that
would
meet
one
of
the
four
factors
in
cort,
but
only
one.
unknown
speaker
it
will
give
you
a
whole
lot
of
trouble,
in
view
of
the
emphasis
in
your
brief
on
intention.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
i
gather,
mr.
sullivan,
that
rigsby
stood
for
the
proposition
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
statute
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
a
particular
class
without
more,
required
the
implication
of
a
cause
of
action
in
his
favor?
unknown
speaker
or
supported
it,
at
least?
unknown
speaker
supported
one,
at
least?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
sullivan,
you
say
it
didn't
require
it
but
it
would
have
supported
it.
one
court
could
have
come
out
against
it
and
another
court
could
have
come
out
in
favor,
and
both
would
have
been
right
under
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
you
do
agree,
then,
that...
or
your
observation
is
that
cort
against
ash
did
cut
back
substantially
on
rigsby?
unknown
speaker
how
many
are
there,
mr.
sullivan?
unknown
speaker
how
many
are
supreme
court
cases?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
question?
after
you.
mr.
sullivan,
i
wanted
to
follow
up,
if
i
might,
on
justice
powell's
question
about,
assume
we
forget
about
everything
since...
or
assume
cort
v.
ash
were
the
law
in
1936,
and
you
said
the
analysis
would
be
more
difficult
under
4b
then.
would
the
analysis
of
the
private
cause
of
action
issue
under
4b
be
any
different
in
your
view
than
the
analysis
under
the
securities
act
for
a
10b
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
so
the
reasoning
which
would
destroy
the
4b
cause
of
action
would
also
presumably
destroy
the
10b
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
jurisdictional
provision
in
the
securities
act,
both
1933
and
1934,
and
none
in
the
act
of
1936,
with
respect
to
commodities.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sullivan,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
or
two
that
i
would
ask
the
solicitor
general
if
he
were
here?
it
may
not
be
fair
to
ask
you,
but
it
is
a
bit
curious,
at
least
for
me,
that
the
executive
branch
of
government,
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
particular,
should
be
here
today
when
there
is
no
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
arguing
in
favor
of
an
implied
cause
of
action,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
are
scores
of
cases
that
have
fallen
into
the
federal
judicial
system
trying
to
decide
just
what
we
are
trying
to
decide
here
today,
whether
congress
intended
to
create
a
cause
of
action
when
it
didn't
utter
a
single
word
in
the
statute
that
supports
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
curious
thing
for
the
government
of
the
united
states,
the
executive
branch
to
be
arguing
that
the
courts
rather
than
the
legislative
branch
should
decide
this
issue.
now,
how
many
words
would
it
have
taken
congress
to
have
said
in
a
sentence,
15,
20,
25
words,
and
it
said
nothing.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
senate
committee
report,
and
a
couple
of
ambiguous
comments
in
the
house
report.
so
we
have
very
little
guidance,
it
seems
to
me.
you
just
tell
the
solicitor
general
what
i
said.
are
you
here
representing
a
commodities
exchange?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
part
of
the
executive
branch?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
position
of
the
independent
agency
that
private
enforcement
would
aid
the
enforcement
of
this
federal
statute,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
been
preferable
for
congress
to
make
itself
explicit,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
it
would
be
difficult
on
the
part
of
congress
to
make
its
intention
absolute
and
unequivocal,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
quite
answer
my
question.
i
said,
is
there
any
doubt
that
in
a
very
few
words,
whether
25,
as
my
brother
powell
suggested,
or
30,
that
congress
could
make
it
crystal
clear
what
they
intended?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
drafting
that
language,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
whether
it
is
necessary.
that
is
a
separate
question.
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
interesting
expression,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
interesting
expression,
"emphatically"--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
like
saying
the
congressional
silence
was
very
loud
indeed.
unknown
speaker
against
whom?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
make
sure--
unknown
speaker
--with
these
parties
involved,
was
there
a
reparations
remedy?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
one
under
the
statute
or
not?
unknown
speaker
your
colleagues
on
the
other
side
are
to
the
contrary,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandweg,
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
on
the
reparations
point...
you
say
there
is
a
reparations
remedy...
am
i
right
in
believing
that
the
commission
takes
the
position
there
is
none?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
take
the
position
there
is
none,
and
they
deny
all
claims
of
this
kind,
and
there
is
no
review
of
it,
how
can
it
be
an
effective
remedy?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
say
there
is
no
remedy,
that
is
a
reviewable
decision
if
somebody
filed
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandweg,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
somewhat
akin
to
what
justice
powell
asked
previous
counsel.
there
is
much
talk
in
the
record
and
in
the
statute
itself
about
"manipulative
devices".
what
is
a
manipulative
device?
how
do
you
prove
it?
is
it
negligence?
is
it
bad
faith?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
a
judge
charge
a
jury,
then,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
find
on
the
evidence
that
this
was
or
was
not
a
manipulative
device?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
a
typical
case.
unknown
speaker
to
a
certain
extent,
everybody
is
trying
to
manipulate,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sandweg,
the
description
judge
friendly
gave
us
of
the
transaction
here,
would
that
fall
within
your
definition
of
a
manipulative
device?
on
the
potatoes?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
is
not,
but
i
am
just
asking
whether
the
description
judge
friendly
gave
us
in
page
after
page
after
page--
unknown
speaker
--you
suggest,
then,
that
rigsby
was
just
way
out
of
bounds?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is,
yes,
rigsby
was
just
wrong?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
if
there
had
never
been
any
court
cases
on
private
causes
of
action
prior
to
1974,
and
the
question
arose
first
after
1974
as
to
whether
the
exchanges
were
subject
to
suit
in
a
private
cause
of
action,
would
you
say
that
you
win
or
lose?
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
very
case
that
we
have
arose,
and
the
only
thing
that
is
different
is
that
there
never
had
been
any
judicial
judgments
about
private
causes
of
action
prior
to
1974.
unknown
speaker
but
your
theory
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
because
of
the
unbroken
line
of
judicial
precedent
you
refer
to,
and
because
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1974
amendments,
that
congress
thereby
expressed
its
intent
with
respect
to
a
private
cause
of
action.
isn't
that
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
and
that
there
should
be
a
private
cause
of
action
against
the
exchanges.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
you
say
congress
said
in
1974?
unknown
speaker
so
that
it
is
completely
irrelevant
since
that
time
how
you
would
come
out
under
cort
v.
ash
or
transamerica
or
anything
else.
the
question
was
settled
in
1974.
congress
said
the
courts
have
said
this
was
our
intention,
they
were
quite
right,
we
refuse
to
disturb
it,
that
is
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and
did
not
disturb
it.
unknown
speaker
deaktor
was
not
a
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
case.
it
was
cert
denied,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
must
take
the
next
step
from
that
and
say
that
congress
also
must
he
understood
in
1974
to
have
said,
and
the
courts
have
been
quite
right
as
to
what
our
intention
was,
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
in
1974,
congress
in
effect
said,
i
think
you
submit,
that
the
courts
have
correctly
understood
what
our
intention
was
in
1936,
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
available.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
even
better
for
you
if
you
did.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
because
aren't
you
saying
that
congress
not
only
didn't
disturb
what
the
courts
have
said,
but
recognized
the
validity
of
the
courts'
approach?
unknown
speaker
you
submit
the
question
is
over
with.
unknown
speaker
mr.
toboroff?
unknown
speaker
let's
get
back
to
the
hypothetical
that
justice
white
asked,
which
was,
let's
assume
that
there
had
been
no
federal
court
decisions
prior
to
the
act
of
1974.
on
that
assumption,
where
would
the
burden
of
proof
have
lain
in
this
litigation?
on
you
or
on
your
friends
over
here?
unknown
speaker
what
have
our
cases
said
about
that?
i
have
understood
up
until
today
that
certainly
absent
the
sort
of
line
of
judicial
decisions
you
rely
on,
if
one
claimed
there
was
an
implied
cause
of
action,
that
he
had
the
burden
of
establishing
congressional
intent.
didn't
justice
friendly
say
that
in
his
opinion?
unknown
speaker
may
i
try
another
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
let's
suppose
there
were
no
prior
experience
whatever,
that
this
was
a
de
novo
attempt
to
regulate
the
commodities
market,
and
no
prior
judicial
decisions.
where
would
the
burden
of
proof
lie
if
you
filed
this
complaint?
unknown
speaker
mr.
toboroff,
the
deaktor
case
was
an
antitrust
case,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
looking
at
the
bottom
paragraph
on
page
14
in
414
us,
where
it
says
that,
richey
versus
chicago
mercantile
exchange,
which
was
the
primary
case,
"held
that
an
antitrust
action
against
the
exchange
should
have
been
stayed
to
afford
the
commodity
exchange
commission
an
opportunity
to
determine
if
the
challenged
conduct
of
the
exchange
was
in
compliance
with
the
statute
and
with
exchange
rules.
"
"because
administrative
adjudication
of
alleged
violations
of
the
cea
and
the
rules
lay
at
the
heart
of
the
task
assigned
the
commission
by
congress,
we
recognize
that
the
court,
although
retaining
final
authority
to
interpret
the
cea
and
the
relationship
of
the
antitrust
laws
should
avail
itself
of
the
abilities
of
the
commission
to
unravel
the
intricate
technical
facts
of
the
commodity
industry
and
arrive
at
some
judgment
as
to
whether
the
exchange
had
conducted
itself
in
compliance
with
the
law.
"
unknown
speaker
but
the
deaktor
case
doesn't
talk
about
a
private
right
of
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
you
say
deaktor
is
a
supreme
court
case.
unknown
speaker
which
says
nothing
about
an
implied
right
of
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
presumably
could
read
it
for
themselves,
couldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
which
would
they
have
taken
to
be
the
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
would
have
taken
to
be
the
law
the
supreme
court
decision,
not
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
more
than
that.
it
implicitly
sustained
them,
because
it
remanded
and
said
abstain
rather
than
dismiss,
and
if
there
was
no
private
cause
of
action,
they
would
have
said
dismiss.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
10b(5)
cardon
decision
in
1946
emptied
the
dockets?
unknown
speaker
why
then
don't
these
private
litigant
suits
stop
manipulations?
cardon
was
decided
in
1946,
and
the
suits
have
been
legion
since
then.
unknown
speaker
and
then
back.
unknown
speaker
they
saw
all
that
going
on
and
they
didn't
express
one
word
about
creating
a
private
right
of
action.
unknown
speaker
mr.
toboroff,
can
you
tell
me
why
you
don't
pursue
your
reparations
remedy?
unknown
speaker
and
the
exchange
isn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
friendly
thought
there
was
no
reparation
available
against
the
exchange
then.
unknown
speaker
that
is
because
they
are
not
registered.
is
that
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
mr.
toboroff--
unknown
speaker
--in
your
brief,
one
of
the
main
points...
page
22
is
where
it
commences...
you
state
that
congress
did
not
by
today's
standards
know
how
to
imply
a
private
remedy
even
if
it
wished
to.
if
it
wished
to
provide
a
remedy,
would
it
not
have
done
so
explicitly?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
cort
v.
ash
and
its
progeny
changed
the
law.
unknown
speaker
it
is
true
that
the
remand
by
this
court
wouldn't
have
made
any
sense
unless
this
court
assumed
there
was
a
private
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
order
dismissal.
