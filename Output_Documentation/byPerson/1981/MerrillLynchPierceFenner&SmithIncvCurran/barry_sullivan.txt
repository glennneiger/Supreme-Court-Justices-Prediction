mr.
barry
sullivan
i
can't
say
that
that
is
a
question
that
i
have
particularly
given
my
consideration
to
before
now.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
more
difficult
than
under
rigsby.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
those
courts
were
necessarily
wrong,
because
they
are
applying
a
different
test,
but
as
someone
said
in
response
to
a
question
earlier,
they
might
have
gotten
to
the
same
place
by
a
different
test.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
think
that
first
of
all,
under
cort,
i
would
have
to
start
by
saying
that
section
4b
was
enacted
for
the
especial
benefit
of
futures
traders.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that
is
correct,
and
i
would
say
that
in
1936,
that
was
the
case.
that
is
how
i
would
start
the
process.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
and
the
second
factor
is
the
one
that
might
give
us
some
trouble,
as
far
as
congress's--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--well,
it
would,
and
i
concede
that,
but
the
problem
is
that
in
1936,
when
congress
enacted
the
language
that
it
did
in
4b,
it
wasn't
aware
of
the
cort
test,
obviously,
and
it
was
operating
under
rigsby.
presumably,
the
congress
then
thought
that
if
it
were
appropriate
to
have
an
implied
right
of
action
under
section
4b,
the
courts
would
imply
one.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any...
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
go
back
and
to
see
what
congress
did
in
1936
and
to
analyze
it
in
terms
of
today's
law,
and
that
is
basically
the
emphasis
of
our
brief,
and
i
think
justifiably
so.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
don't
think
that
it
required
the
implication
of
class
action--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--pardon
me?
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
as
has
been
stated
in
either
sierra
club
or
middlesex
county
by
justice
stevens,
these
were
really
analogous
to
the
freewheeling
days
before
erie.
these
were
the
freewheeling
days
before
cort.
it
was
well
established
in
the
1890s
and
in
1936
when
congress
enacted
4b
that
the
courts
were
under
a
statutory
tort
theory
going
to
go
ahead
and
finish
the
job
that
presumably
congress
could
have
done
if
it
wanted
to.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
think
that
is
probably
accurate.
i
think
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case,
although
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter
of
legal
history,
to
say
how
somebody
would
apply
rigsby.
i
am
really
not
an
expert
in
that.
however,
i
think
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discretion
left
to
the
courts
under
rigsby
to
determine
whether
the
implication
of
a
particular
remedy,
one
among
many,
presumably,
would
be
felicitous
in
terms
of
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
the
goals
that
the
statute
was
directed
at
furthering.
this
is
a
very
different
world
that
we
are
talking
about
in
terms
of
what
the
law
was
when
congress
enacted
this
section
in
1936
and
what
the
law
is
today,
let
alone
what
the
law
was
in
1974
when
congress
amended
the
statute.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that,
mr.
justice
white.
what
i
think
should
also
be
said
about
the
cases
that
were
decided
on
which
we
relied
prior
to
1974
is
that
not
only
were
they
unanimous,
not
only
were
they
before
congress,
congress
was
clearly
aware
that
this
was
what
the
state
of
the
law
was--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
it
depends
on
who
is
doing
the
counting,
as
to
how
many.
there,
i
think,
are
about
ten
or
eleven
that
either
hold
it
or
say
it
indicta
with
respect
to
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
act.
some
are
4b
cases
and
some
are
manipulation
cases.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
there
is
one
supreme
court
case,
the
deaktor
case,
in
which
the
court
held
that
in
the
first
instance
a
manipulation
claim
should
be
presented
to
the
agency,
and
while
the
court
didn't
squarely
hold
in
that
case,
and
we
certainly
concede
that
it
didn't,
that
there
was
a
private
remedy
under
the
manipulation
section.
certainly
the
implication
of
the
court's
decision
that
you
go
in
the
first
instance
to
the
agency
or
to
the
old
commission
certainly
implies
that
in
the
second
instance
you
can
go
to
court,
and
indeed,
the
exchanges
did
not
contest
that
in
that
case.
they
simply
argued
the
case,
and
it
was
argued
here
as
a
prime
jurisdiction
question,
which
again
shows
how
well
settled
in
our
view
the
law
was
at
that
time.
and
along
that
line,
in
fact,
in
1974,
when
the
exchanges,
in
an
attempt
to
cut
back
on
their
liability,
went
to
congress
and
in
effect
conceded
that
as
the
law
stood
then
they
could
be
liable
under
the
manipulation
provisions,
and
that
they
needed
relief,
and
congress...
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
gave
them
any
relief.
in
years
later,
in
testimony
before
the
commission,
as
we
point
out,
the
commodity
professionals,
the
industry
also
treated
this
as
a
question
that
had
been
decided
against
them,
both
by
the
courts
and
by
congress
in
1974
by
testifying
before
the
commission
that
a
private
right
of
action
was
still
available,
and
this
was
cramping
their
style,
in
effect,
and
it
is
only
now,
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
when
this
court's
decisions
since
cannon
have
given
the
commodities
industry
a
handle,
a
legal
handle
that
they
now
say
that
there
was
never
any
cause
of
action.
mr.
barry
sullivan
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that...
i
think
the
placement
of
the
jurisdictional
provision
in
the
particular
statute
isn't
particularly
important.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
some
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
and
presumably
if
you
agree
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
you
would
find
that
there
was
general
federal...
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
barry
sullivan
yes.
i
am
representing
the
commission.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
perhaps
should
have
the
solicitor
general
here
to
answer
that
question,
too.
but
it
is
an
independent--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
right,
and
i
think
that...
i
was
preparing
a
response
to
justice
powell's
question,
not
realizing
that
i
wouldn't
have
an
opportunity
to
answer
it,
and
i
would
just
say
that
if
we
did
not
believe
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
historical
context
in
which
this
issue
arises
led
us
to
the
view
that
congress
intended
a
private
right
of
action
to
be
sustained
in
1974,
we
would
not
be
here.
but
we
believe
that
there
is
a
fine
line
between
this
court's
using
judicial
restraint
quite
properly
as
a
shield
to
protect
itself
from
having
to
legislate
unconstitutionally,
perhaps,
as
opposed
to
using
it
as
a
sword
to
not
give
effect
to
what
congress's
intent
clearly
was,
and
we
believe
that
congress's
intent
is
manifest,
despite
the
fact
that
the
people
who
were
drafting
this
legislation
might
have
gotten
a
b
rather
than
an
a
on
a
law
school
exam
because
they
didn't
use
the
case
names--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
it
would
have
been
preferable,
but
i
think
that
in
the
historical
context
the
question
really
is,
why
should
congress
have
thought
that
it
was
necessary,
and
i
think
everyone
knows
that
when
congress
goes
back
and
puts
in
a
few
words
in
a
statute,
that
is
also
fertile
ground
for
further
litigation
as
to
whether
the
words
that
have
been
put
in
the
statute
mean
exactly
what
the
case
law
said
previously.
therefore,
that
may
be
just
as
problematic
as
being
silent.
mr.
barry
sullivan
my
basic
response,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
in
1974
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
do
that,
and
that
is
why--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
that
that
is
certainly--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--well,
i
can't
say
that
i
have
had
any
experience
as
a
statutory
draftsman
in
the
past,
but
i
think
that
that
is
probably
true,
but
again
the
question
is,
why
would
congress
have
thought
in
1974
that
it
was
necessary.
