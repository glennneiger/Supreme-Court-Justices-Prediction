mr.
richard
n.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
limited
to
a
question
of
vagueness
of
a
drug
paraphernalia
ordinance.
vagueness,
of
course,
has
been
defined
by
this
court
under
grayned
versus
rockford
as
an
ordinance
or
statute
that
gives
a
person
of
ordinary
intelligence
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
know
what
is
prohibited,
and
also
that
there
are
in
fact
standards
for
those
who
must
enforce
this
ordinance.
the
u.
s.
district
court
found
this
ordinance
constitutional
in
all
respects.
the
challenge
was
not
just
to
vagueness,
but
in
fact
as
to
first
amendment
issues,
as
to
overbreadth,
and
as
to
equal
protection.
the
u.
s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reached
only
the
vagueness
issue,
and
said
quite
clearly
that
they
did
not
reach
the
other
issues,
although
i
think
it
important
to
point
out
that
in
the
brief
of
flipside,
they
argue
that
first
amendment
issues
are
present
which
would
call
for
a
stricter
test.
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
reach
that
issue,
did
not
apply
those
issues.
so,
before
the
court
today
in
the
briefs,
first
amendment
issues
have
been
briefed
even
though
we
rely
on
a
less
rigorous
standard,
in
that
this
is
a
civil
licensing
ordinance,
and
we
believe
one
that
does
not
invade
constitutionally
protected
areas.
flipside
argues
that
first
amendment
issues
are
present,
and
therefore
the
stricter
standards
should
follow.
i
can
review
that.
what
we
have
is
presumptive
validity.
we
do
not
have
constitutionally
protected
issues.
we
do
not
have
a
criminal
ordinance,
and
we
are
asking
the
court
review
on
a
less
stricter
review
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
not
in
the
state
of
illinois.
it
is
quasi-criminal.
it
is
tried
civilly
as
a
civil
violation
of
the
village
code.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
there
could
be
a
fine
of
up
to
$500.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
no,
it
is
regarded
as
quasi-criminal.
even
traffic
violations
or
ordinance
violations
are
quasi-criminal,
and
treated
civilly,
with
the
civil
tests
of
preponderance
only.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
well,
i
think
they
do,
from
national
dairy
and
other
areas,
and
we
have
conceded
that
any
ordinance
or
statute
still
is
subject
to
vagueness
tests,
but
we
think
it
is
a
stricter
test
because
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
in
opinions
involving
criminal
matters.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
well,
it
depends.
if
we
are
going
after
a
head
shop
per
se,
they
obviously
would
be
licensed
and
could
sell
this
to
adults.
if
we
are
going
to
a
convenience
store
that
is
selling
this
type
of
item,
then
they
have
no
license,
they
could
be
brought
before
the
local
circuit
court
that
would
sit--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--no,
it
was
both.
i
don't
believe
they
reached
facial
invalidity.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
they
said
it
was
vague,
but
they
did
apply
the
civil
test
to
it.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
i
believe
they
were.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
then
i
think
under
what
the
second
circuit
just
came
down
with
in
brockey,
that
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
review,
that
the
matter
goes
back,
until
there
is
in
fact
a
real
challenge.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
when
this
ordinance
was
written,
there
were
no
court
opinions.
this
was
written
in
february
of
'78,
at
the
direction
of
the
village
board
to
myself.
since
then,
as
you
can
see,
there
has
been
an
explosion
of
litigation
in
both
state
and
federal
courts.
as
draftsman
of
the
ordinance,
i
had
to
meet
many
concerns,
of
course,
not
guided
by
the
case
law
as
we
now
know
it.
the
first
consideration
was
to
determine,
should
we
criminalize
or
should
we
license
because
of
the
proliferation
of
what
we
believe
was
in
the
rational
interest
of
roach
clips,
bong
pipes,
and
the
like.
it
was
recognized
that
most
of
these
items
are
legal
in
and
of
themselves,
that
there
is
not,
as
justice
white
states,
obviously
that
they
are
illegal.
there
are
some
items,
however,
that
are,
so
we
have
approached
it
two
ways,
those
items
that
are
designed
for
use
with
illegal
drugs
and
those
items
that
are
marketed
for
use,
and
of
course
our
emphasis
would
be
on
the
marketing,
because
this
is
no
different
than
milk,
food,
flowers,
paint,
clothing,
and
so
on.
every
municipality
licenses
its
retailers
within
the
confines
of
its
jurisdiction,
and
this
is
regulating
at
the
commercial
source.
so
we
chose
not
to
definitely
define
each
of
these
items.
if
you
have
gone
through
what
is
known
as
the
model
act,
and
some
of
the
state
statutes
that
are
in
the
cases
cited,
you
will
see
they
make
an
attempt
to
specifically
identify
this
power
hitter,
this
bong
pipe.
we
saw
the
difficulty
right
away
with
trying
to
make
these
items
per
se.
we
chose
to
regulate,
therefore,
at
the
retail
sale,
rather
than
put
the
onus
on
some
innocent
purchaser
that
may
or
may
not
know
what
he
is
purchasing,
to
put
the
burden
back
on
the
retailer,
in
essence,
under
the
mcgowan
theory.
we
do
only
penalize
minors
in
the
area
where
they
would
drink
under
age
or
buy
tobacco
under
age
by
state
statute
and
city
ordinance,
and
both
of
these
have
criminal
prohibitions.
we
chose
to
place
no
criminal
prohibition
even
on
a
minor
that
bought
from
a
retailer
that
was
selling
illegally.
we
believe
this
also
addresses
the
question
of
transferred
intent.
in
the
record
revolution
number
6
versus
parma
case,
that
was
before
this
court
for
review
in
june
of
this
year,
or
may
of
this
year,
the
sixth
circuit
rejected
that
parma
ordinance
on
two
bases.
one,
that
there
was
a
transferred
intent,
that
if
the
retailer,
the
manufacturer
intended
it
for
illegal
use
and
the
purchaser
bought
it
innocently,
they
could
go
back
and
prove
this
intent,
and
here
we
would
have
a
possible
conviction.
so
they
found
a
vagueness
there.
secondly,
that
ordinance
said
that
you
can't
advertise
these
types
of
items,
and
that
was
just
one
small
city
in
the
state
of
ohio.
we
chose
not
to
touch
the
first
amendment
at
all.
we
have
not
raised
questions
of
advertising.
we
were
very
careful
and
prudent
to
avoid
first
amendment
issues.
throughout
the
district
court
proceedings
and
seventh
circuit
proceedings,
we
have
been
attempted
to
be
painted
with
a
first
amendment
argument.
it
has
always
been
our
intent
to
avoid
that,
and
i
think
successfully
so.
we
chose
to
avoid
those
issues
even
though
i
think
under
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy
and
pittsburgh
press,
that
if
they
did
advertise
these
items,
clearly
this
would
not
be
protected
speech,
and
we
could
proceed,
and
since
then,
i
believe
both
the
eighth
circuit,
tenth
circuit,
and
a
number
of
the
other
federal
opinions
have
found
that
these
are
not
first
amendment
issues
when
they
are
promoting
the
sale
of
these
items
for
illegal
purposes.
amicus
attorneys
general
have
filed
a
brief--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--yes.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
the
advertisement
goes
to
the
broad
spectrum
of
the
community,
and
it
would
be
argued
as
first
amendment
expression.
they
would
argue
that
the
fact
that
they
merely
displayed
these
items
together
is
a
form
of
free
expression
and
free
speech.
i
believe
that
in
the
retail
setting,
that
if
you...
these
things
fall
together.
if
you
find
that
our
language,
"marketed
for
use
with
illegal
drugs.
"
is
not
vague,
then
even
if
their
argument
on
display
could
be
free
expression,
it
falls
because
it
is
advocating
use
with
illegal
substances,
and
i
believe
in
my
reply
brief
i
cited
a
number
of
these
cases,
i
believe,
music
stop
from
california
and
novai
from
michigan,
that
have
said
display
does
not
reach
first
amendment
issues.
also,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
in
the
carterella
case,
looked
at
display
and
said,
this
is
not
first
amendment
material,
and
other
courts
have
just
gone
right
over
that
issue
and
not
even
addressed
it.
the
model
act
that
so
many
of
these
cases
addressed
was
not
written
by
the
drug
enforcement
agency
of
the
department
of
justice
until
18
months
after
we
had
drafted
our
ordinance.
so
this
is
not
to
say
today
that
we
may
prefer
to
take
that
particular
action
that
in
fact
criminalizes
this
conduct.
in
fact,
it
gives
us
a
strong
control
over
this
proliferation
in
the
community.
but
at
that
time
we
went
with
what
we
had,
but
i
think
their
argument
addresses
very
clearly
the
issue
of
intent
in
the
words
"designed
for
use".
they
have
traced
the
long
history
of
it,
in
prohibition
cases
and
other
cases,
and
i
think
the
same
language
that
this
court
applied
in
parker
v.
levy,
the
history
of
interpretation
of
the
words
can
be
applied
to
"designed
for
use".
in
their
brief,
they
point
out
the
number...
i
think
the
delaware
opinion,
and
the
maryland
district
court
opinion,
both
that
adopt
this
word
and
found
that
intent
or
scienter
is
entered
by
this,
and
i
think
we
can
go
back
to
the
boyce
case
as
well,
where
this
court
clearly
said
the
word,
the
magic
word
"intent"
need
not
be
used.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
there
were
no
previous
interpretations,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
not
at
the
district
court.
it
did
not
come
to
that
issue
at
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
designed
or
marketed,
we
believe,
are
active
words,
as
opposed
to
passive.
they
are
calling
for
an
act
on
behalf
of
the
retailer,
and
we
believe
that
by
placing
goods
in
a
marketing
setting,
that
they
could
be
used
with
illegal
drugs,
or
designing
them,
or
knowing
that
they
are
designed
by
the
manufacturer
and
placing
them,
that
it
puts
on
us
the
requirement
to
show
that
that
was
their
intent
and
understanding,
that
this
one
innocent
item
a
buyer
for
a
large
retail
chain
may
have
put
out
not
knowing
the
intent,
we
would
lose
that
on
the
civil
question
of
licensing
in
that
there
is
no
way
we
could
show
that
he
knew
what
the
design
was
or
he
knew
how
it
was
marketed.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
absolutely.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
well,
it
puts
the
measure,
the
activity
measure
on
the
person
we
are
going
after,
the
retailer,
so--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--yes.
if
he
markets
it,
obviously
he
is
showing
an
intent
in
the
way
that
he
did
it.
it
wasn't
an
accident,
when
he
has
case
after
case
of
bong
pipes
and
papers
and
so
on.
i
am
asking
the
court
to
not
infer
it,
but
to
presume
it.
the
district
court,
i
feel...
excuse
me,
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe,
strained
to
find
an
interpretation
other
than
designed
for
use.
they
quoted
as
record
revolution
and
the
sixth
circuit
quoted
the
normal
v.
sindak
case,
that
was
in
the
additional
opinions
filed
by
counsel
for
flipside.
that
case
from
indiana
with
a
three-judge
panel
looked
at
the
dictionary
and
found
two
alternative
definitions
to
design,
and
this
both
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
found
did
not
give
a
clear
definition,
and
yet
we
have
hejira,
the
tenth
circuit
case,
that
says,
no,
we
reject
that
there
are
alternative
uses,
these
are
particular
uses,
we
are
going
to
look
at
that
definition.
community
action
against
drug
abuse'
brief
here,
their
amicus
brief
clearly
sets
out
what
the
dictionary
says.
this
court
has
said
in
rose
v.
lock
that
you
can
go
to
the
dictionary
to
make
the
determination,
and
i
think
justice
rehnquist's
statement
in
u.
s.
v.
powell
is
very,
very
apropos
here.
a
court
should
not
strain
to
find
unconstitutionality.
it
should
take
the
words
as
they
are
and
not
strain
to
find
an
alternative
meaning.
the
court
also
said
in
that
u.
s.
versus
powell
that
under
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine,
such
cases
should
be
determined
by
the
facts
at
hand,
and
i
think
that
is
another
important
point.
throughout
the
case
the
argument
is
made,
what
about
this
poor
hardware
dealer
that
has
his
alligator
clip
that
could
be
adapted
for
use
as
a
roach
clip?
well,
we
are
not
concerned
about
the
poor
hardware
dealer
in
this
case.
the
facts
at
hand
are,
we
are
dealing
with
a
record
store
that
sells
these
particular
type
of
items,
and
we
are
looking
at
the
way
this
particular
store
displays
them.
that
is
the
facts
at
hand.
to
return
to
the
mcgowan
versus
maryland
test,
we
argue
that
grayned
is--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--we
hope
so.
i
don't
believe
we
are
entering
into
constitutionally
protected
areas,
and
i
think
chilling
is
an
appropriate
word.
i
think
drug
abuse
is
a
serious
cancer
in
our
society,
and
we
think
that
this
will
chill
the
retailing
of
these
items
to
be
used
with
illegal
drugs.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
well,
i
am
realistic
enough
to
know
it
would
only
be
a
chill,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
mcgowan
test
takes
what
we
say
in
grayned
as
the
ordinary
person
and
moves
it
to
the
retailer.
now
we
are
not
talking
about
anybody
on
the
street,
because
this
ordinance
can
only
be
enforced
against
the
retailer,
and
in
that
case
out
of
ann
arundel
county,
they
had
a
sunday
ban
on
sales
for
other
merchants
but
you
could
sell
them
down
at
the
beach,
and
they
said,
well,
you
can
find
out
what
you
can
sell
and
what
you
can't
sell
by
your
ordinary
commercial
knowledge
or
by
reasonable
investigation,
and
we
argue
that
if
there
are
marginal
areas,
and
certainly
they
can
be
raised
in
this
case,
if
there
are
marginal
areas,
a
prudent
businessman
of
ordinary
commercial
knowledge
can
find
what
these
differences
are.
in
fact,
in
this
record
you
will
see
time
after
time
the
owner
of
the
store
called
my
office,
asked
me
for
an
interpretation,
followed
it.
these
guidelines
that
you
have
before
you,
these
temporary
guidelines,
that
were
issued
by
the
village,
were
pursuant
to
a
phone
conversation
written
up
and
given
to
the
merchant
concerned,
that
he
was
making
a
reasonable
investigation.
now,
what
about
the
items
themselves?
there
were
79
items
introduced
by
flipside
in
this
case;
72
were
of
the
type
that
they
sold.
what
we
attempted
to
avoid
was
saying,
could
this
always
be
used
with
illegal
substances?
and
i
think
we
did.
you
take
tobacco
paper
or
papers
that
you
roll
your
own.
clearly
they
can
be
used
with
a
legal
purpose.
but
they
also
can
be
used
with
an
illegal
purpose,
but
they
aren't
designed
for
a
legal
purpose.
so
we
set
those
aside.
that
is
fine.
you
can
sell
those.
what
about
a
scale?
you
can
use
that
to
weigh
your
letters
at
home,
and
other
things.
there
are
these
home
type
scales.
they
put
four
or
five
of
these
into
evidence.
it
has
got
a
legal
use.

assistance
to
get
the
last
hit
of
a
marijuana
cigarette.
we
will
put
that
over
here.
a
hemostat.
i
was
presented...
i
was
a
witness
on
behalf
of
flipside
on
cross
examination.
they
gave
me
a
hemostat.
i
didn't
know
what
it
was.
they
told
me
it
is
medical
instrument.
but
they
sell
it.
then
they
stipulated,
and
you
will
find
that
at
page
29
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
don't
sell
tobacco.
they
don't
sell
medical
supplies.
but
those
five
items
i
just
mentioned,
the
water
pipe,
the
papers,
and
so
on,
they
are
selling
them
together
in
the
same
display.
i
think
there
is
only
one
common
denominator
here,
and
that
is
our
theory,
the
common
denominator
theory.
what
is
the
one
common
use
that
can
be
used
with
these
items?
and
that,
of
course,
as
any
child
or
parent
would
know,
would
be
to
be
used
with
illegal
substances.
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
they
will
be
used
with
illegal
substances,
not
tobacco
or
any
other
item.
the
federal
district
court
in
new
jersey
took
judicial
notice
that
this
is
the
intent.
the
courts
in
their
opinions
and
in
the
literature
state
that
this
is
proliferating,
and
it
is
likely
to
be
used
for
this.
so
we
are
really
asking
the
court
two
things.
one,
to
make
that
tott-leary
presumption
that
this
is
more
likely
than
not
in
this
situation,
or,
two,
take
judicial
notice
that
that
is
what
they
are
selling
these
items
for
in
the
stores
when
they
display
them
together,
when
they
market
them
together.
one
other
concern
we
had
by
the
seventh
circuit
is,
they
said,
we
fear
this
type
of
legislation
on
lifestyles,
and
i
can't
make
the
argument
strong
enough
that
i
think
under
the
rational
interest
of
the
community
and
the
state
we
have
a
right
to
legislate
against
lifestyles,
such
as
homicidal
maniacs,
burglars,
and
drug
abusers,
and
this
is
one
way,
a
civil
remedy
to
go
after
a
drug
abuser.
we
don't
like
his
lifestyle
in
hoffman
estates,
and
i
don't
think
anywhere
else
in
the
country
do
they
care
for
that
lifestyle,
and
i
believe
we
have
a
right
to
legislate.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
subsection...
48(a),
subsection
(a).
mr.
richard
n.
williams
no,
that
is
a
misprint.
you
will
find
that--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--you
will
find
that
same
language
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
10,
i
believe,
the
ordinance
is
set
out,
and
you
will
see
that
it
says
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
or
persons
as
principal
clerk,
agent,
or
servant
to
sell
any
items,
paraphernalia,
or
thing
which
is
designed
or
marketed
for
use
with
illegal
cannibis
or
drugs.
"
mr.
richard
n.
williams
yes,
it
appears
to
be
in
error.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
i
was
in
florida
several
weeks
ago,
and
they
do
advise
in
the
press
that
marijuana
is
now
the
second
largest
cash
crop,
and
we
know
by
the
fourth
amendment
cases
that
come
before
this
court
that
drug
abuse
and
use
is
rampant,
and
i
think
there
is
a
rational
interest
to
look
at
this
particular
industry.
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
to
the
court
and
drug
enforcement
agency
testimony
they
estimate
it
is
up
to
a
$3
billion
industry.
i
have
some
questions
about
that
large
of
an
industry,
but
certainly
it
is
something
that
is
going
on,
and
we
believe
that
we
have
a
rational
interest
to
go
after
it,
and
we
do
ban
it
on
minors.
that
is
another
issue
that
has
to
be
addressed.
we
ban
these
types
of
items,
even
though
they
are
legal,
and
we
recognize
they
are
legal
for
the
most
part,
we
ban
their
sale
to
minors
in
the
same
way
we
ban
tobacco
and
cigarettes,
and
i
think
under
the
ginsburg
versus
new
york
guidelines,
that
we
can
treat
minors
differently
than
adults,
especially
in
this
area.
the
guidelines
raise
another
issue.
the
model
act
guidelines
i
believe
are
good
guidelines.
the
eighth
circuit
thought
they
were.
the
tenth
circuit
thought
they
were.
the
second
circuit
recently
thought
they
were,
in
brockey,
which
is
now
at
558
fed
second.
we
find
that
the
guidelines
we
issued,
very
short,
very
temporary,
nonetheless
gave
an
enforcement
officer
and
the
retailer
an
idea
of
what
we
were
looking
for.
they
addressed
themselves
primarily
to
display.
we
found
things
as
roach
clips
were
per
se,
we
conceded
that
those
were
designed
for
legal
uses.
now,
alligator
clips
and
other
things
can
be
adapted,
but
what
we
were
saying
was,
the
way
you
display
it
is
what
we
are
going
to
look
at,
and
again
they
tried
to
paint
us
with
a
first
amendment,
because
if
they
have
a
child's
garden
of
cocaine,
or
some
other
type
of
book,
or
a
cocaine
mirror,
they
suddenly
say
that
is
first
amendment
expression.
i
again
go
back
to
virginia
board
of
pharmacy.
i
again
go
back
to
pittsburg
press
to
say,
we
can
limit
that
expression.
but
more
than
that,
in
the
district
court
we
flatly
denied
it
was
a
first
amendment
issue.
they
agreed.
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
reach
that
issue.
the
other
courts
have
said
that
type
of
thing
does
not
reach
first
amendment
proportions.
but
i
think
that
has
to
be
looked
at
and
addressed
here.
one
other
point
that
we
make
that
the
district
court
found
was
proper
and
the
seventh
circuit
had
some
concern
with
was
our
administrative
procedure
act.
i
wrote
an
administrative
procedure
act
a
year
before
based
upon
the
administrative
procedure
acts
that
states
use.
and
if
you
are
selling
milk
or
selling
food,
we
have
hearings,
we
have
guidelines,
we
tell
you
how
hot
the
water
has
to
be
to
wash
the
dishes
and
so
on,
all
the
nitty-gritty.
we
do
the
same
thing
with
everything
we
license,
just
like
the
federal
government.
and
we
were
preparing
to
go
to
those
procedure
hearings
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed.
but
on
file
were
the
temporary
guidelines,
so
we
think
that
we
did
meet
the
guideline
requirement
of
grayned
in
an
adequate
manner.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
not
a
word,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
not
a
word.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
although
we
have
had
some
concerns
in
this
post-monnell
and
post-owen
area.
we
would
not
legislate
in
this
area
for
solicitation
or
obscenity.
we
feel
that
is
a
chilling
effect.
we
are
bound
by
this.
we
passed
this
before
owens.
but
at
this
point,
good
faith,
bad
faith,
we
are
looking
at
possible
liabilities,
and
have
great
concerns
in
that
manner,
as
i
addressed
in
my
jurisdictional
statement.
lastly,
a
point
that
i
think
should
be
considered
is
the
register.
there
is
great
concern
about
this
on
chilling
effect.
we
require
that
the
person,
the
adult
person
buying
these
items
has
to
sign
a
register,
the
same
as
you
would
for
a
controlled
substance
class
5
under
the
controlled
substance
act.
this
court
has
had
some
of
those
cases,
but
primarily
of
physician-patient
relationship.
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
this?
it
is
going
to
be
a
record.
if
in
fact
somebody
to
glamorize
and
promote
his
drug
industry,
his
drug
sales
to
the
high
school,
is
buying
a
lot
of
this
paraphernalia,
we
may
look
at
him.
we
may
make
an
investigation.
but
we
are
always
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment.
and
since
this
does
not
invade
constitutionally
protected
activity,
we
see
no
reason
since
this
act
has
been
upheld
for
paragoric
and
other
types
of
classified
substances,
why
it
can't
be
upheld
for
this
type
of
paraphernalia.
everything
we
wrote
here
was
what
had
already
been
approved.
minors,
we
knew
tobacco
we
could
ban.
we
put
that
in.
the
register,
we
knew
controlled
5
substances
could
require
a
register,
we
put
that
in.
it
may
in
fact
trap
the
unwary
criminal.
but
if
i
remember
the
court's
comments
on
the
entrapment
cases,
we
are
permitted
to
trap
the
unwary
criminal.
the
nexus
argument
was
made
in
their
brief
and
responded
to
in
our
reply
brief,
are
these
things
like
burglar
tools?
a
crowbar
is
legal
when
you
are
using
it
to
pry
something
open.
it
is
now
a
burglar
tool.
they
claim
then
a
bong
pipe
is
legal,
and
when
you
light
up
some
cannibis
in
it
it
becomes
illegal
or
paraphernalia.
we
feel
that
the
presumption
at
the
point
of
sale
handles
that
situation,
and
that
there
is
that
nexus
or
connection.
i
would
state
that
the
hejira
versus
mcfarlane
case
that
just
came
out
in
660
fed
second...
it
is
in
the
additional
authorities,
but
the
citation
has
just
been
issued...
talks
about
the
nexus
between
abuse
of
controlled
substances
and
glorification
of
those
devices.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
no,
there
was
no
prosecution.
there
was
no
active...
we
were
in
communication
at
all
times.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
yes,
i
made
it
clear
that
perhaps
they
should
clear
their
display
cases.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
we--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--yes,
the
way
they
were
displaying
their
items
with
papers
and
pipes
together,
we
said
that
that
would
be
under
the
ordinance.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
yes,
there
was
no
question
about
it.
in
fact,
judge
layton
in
his
opinion
said,
why,
they
unerringly
went
to
their
display
cases
and
removed
all
these
items.
they
clearly
were
a
retailer
who
understood
what
the
ordinance
meant.
in
summary,
i
would
ask
that
even
though
the
seventh
circuit
only
reached
the
issue
of
vagueness
here,
and
if
the
court
finds
that
this
ordinance
is
not
vague,
then
normally
it
would
be
remanded
for
further
consideration,
but
they
chose
to
go
ahead
and
brief
the
first
amendment
and
overbreadth
issues,
and
we
have
briefed
back.
the
last
issue
was
equal
protection,
which
no
court
has
seriously
considered.
we
feel
we
are
permitted
to
take
any
particular
industry
and
legislate
if
we
do
it
in
a
reasonable
manner.
so,
i
would
ask
for
the
benefit
of
those
other
opinions
that
are
pending
that
a
full
opinion
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
i
think
it
is
about
the...
we
put
an
instruction
in
there,
please
alphabetize,
and
it
was
not
done.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
they
were
not
alphabetized.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
that
was
an
error.
we
requested
that
and
it
was
not
done.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
counsel
has
just
mentioned
smith
versus
gogan.
that
case...
we
compare
the
less
stringent
requirements
of
modern
vagueness
with
cases
dealing
with
purely
economic
regulation,
which
i
believe
this
is.
in
the
two
minutes
i
have
left,
there
are
a
couple
of
points
i
wish
to
make.
he
said,
well,
you
license
all
milk,
but
you
don't
license
all
corncob
pipes.
we
didn't
say
we
do.
we
license
only
corncob
pipes
marketed
for
use
with
illegal
drugs.
and
again,
we
go
back
to
display.
the
chief
justice
asked
about
hypodermic.
many
of
the
older
statutes
have
this
in
them
from
the...
that
go
quite
a
ways
back
before
we
got
into
head
shops,
and
i
would
like
to
leave
a
citation
with
the
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
hypodermic
issue,
where
they
did
infer
intent
in
that
particular
area.
it
was
313
atlantic
second,
876,
rosser
v.
u.
s.,
and
justice
white
was
concerned
with
bong.
well,
the
court
reporter
was
as
well.
the
court
reporter
didn't
know
what
a
bong
was,
and
on
page
52
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
testimony
of
our
police
officer
to
show
the
presumption
that
what
they
sell
is
being
used
for
illegal
drugs,
"officer,
have
you
come
in
contact
with
what
is
known
as
a
bong
pipe?
"
it
is
printed
as
"bomb".
"yes.
"
"have
you
seen
persons
in
the
community
using
the
item?
"
"do
you
recall
what
was
used?
"
"yes,
generally
cannibis.
"
and
so
on.
so,
i
think
that
is
before
you.
one
other
issue
on
these
mirrors,
with
the
cocaine.
i
would
like
to
take...
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that.
that
is
not
paraphernalia.
judge
layton
said
it
was,
but
we
didn't
argue
it
was,
because
when
you
put
that
up
with
the
things
you
sell,
it
adds
to
the
display
and
your
intent
of
what
you
are
doing
it
for.
i
think
in
direct
sales
if
the
manufacturer
or
the
doctor
that
was
buying
these
loads
of
narcotics
would
have
that
sign
up
in
his
office
or
his
store,
the
circumstantial
evidence
and
presumption
of
what
they
were
doing
would
have
been
much
clearer
and
much
stronger
to
the
court.
the
last
comment
i
wish
to
make
is
from
casbah
v.
thone,
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
and
it
is
at
651
fed
second
at
551,
where
they
said
the
dealer,
on
the
other
hand,
who
sells
innocuous
items
when
the
intent
they
be
used
with
drugs
is
in
effect
put
on
notice
by
the
illicit
nature
of
his
activity
that
he
must
be
careful
to
conform
his
conduct
to
the
law.
even
the
illicit
dealer
is
not
held
legally
responsible,
as
plaintiffs
would
suggest,
for
guessing
what
is
in
the
mind
of
the
buyer.
we
are
going
right
at
the
retailer.
and
this
is
the
opinion
that
seems
to
now
be
adopted
by
the
federal
courts'
reviewing
and
the
circuits
such
as
the
eighth
and
the
tenth
in
these
particular
areas.
mr.
richard
n.
williams
it
depends
on
where
it
is
displayed.
they
sell
records,
and
you
can
escape
listening
to
their
records.
but
if
they
put
it
with
the
paraphernalia--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--it
adds
to
it,
yes.
it
just
is
one
accumulation
to--
mr.
richard
n.
williams
--yes.
it
would
be
one
piece
that
we
would
add
to
the
total
display.
