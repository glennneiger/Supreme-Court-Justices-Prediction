mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
found
in
preparing
for
argument
that
we
have
mis-cited
u.
s.
v.
freed
at
page
47
of
our
brief,
and
would
ask
to
excuse
that
oversight.
in
addition,
i
would
ask
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
recently
published
columbia
law
review,
which
i
just
became
aware
of
a
few
days
ago,
volume
81
at
581,
in
which
it
deals
with
drug
paraphernalia.
a
couple
of
other
law
reviews
had
been
cited
because
we
were
aware
of
them
at
the
time
of
publication.
this
has
just
come
to
our
attention.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
81
columbia
law
review
at
page
581.
appellant
has
attempted
to
narrow
the
question
so
that
the
issue
presented
is
any
item,
effect,
thing
which
is
designed
or
marketed
for
use
with
illegal
drugs,
unconstitutionally
vague.
by
attempting
to
narrow
it
in
that
regard,
it
is
an
attempt
to
overlook
the
dynamics
and
other
problems
inherent
in
the...
in
the
construction
of
the
ordinance
based
on
the
trial
record
and
as
construed
by
the
seventh
circuit.
although
now
we
are
told
that
design
refers
to
some
abstract
intent,
during
the
course
of
his
argument
it
was
clear
that
when
we
talk
about
paraphernalia,
that
is,
when
mr.
williams
talks
about
paraphernalia,
he
is
talking
about
specific
things.
it
presumes
that
we
can
define
paraphernalia.
this
paraphernalia
should
not
be
available
to
kids,
he
says.
it
is
as
though
we
could
define
it
and
excise
it
from
the
community
by
enactment
of
the
ordinance,
but
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
such
is
not
the
case,
that
these
things
are
not
paraphernalia
per
se,
yet
they
claim,
vacillating
between
an
argument
that
this
is
drug
paraphernalia;
on
the
other
hand,
well,
it
is
not
really
paraphernalia,
it
is
paraphernalia
because
of
the
way
it
is
marketed.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
certainly
that
is
relevant
to
other
issues
which
in
this
case
were
commented
on
by
the
seventh
circuit,
that
in
fact
language
does
not
lend
itself
to
precision.
certainly,
as
justice
holmes
noted,
there
is
some
amount
of
looseness,
of
a
lack
of
precision,
that
people
must
act
in
almost
all
events
with
a
certain
amount
of
lack
of
certainty
as
to
the
significance
and
the
consequences
of
their
actions,
but
i
think
that,
for
example,
the
court
speaking
through
you
in
your
opinion
of
u.
s.
v.
paul,
where
you
decided
and
talked
between
cohn
grocery,
in
which
you
indicated
that
there
was
no
standard
in
that
case,
and
talked
about
the
vagaries
of
supply
and
demand.
here,
we
analogize
that
to
taste.
is
a
blue
pipe
inherently
criminal,
and
a
brown
pipe
lawful
because
in
the
officer's
experience
brown
is
customary
and
usual?
is
meerschaum
as
was
introduced
in
this
case,
lawful
except
when
it
had
a
cannabis
leaf
on
a
pipe
it
was
held
to
be
paraphernalia?
we
are
essentially
talking
about
taste,
and
i
think
we
have
been
unfairly
characterized
with
regards
to
what
lifestyle
means.
lifestyle
did
not
refer
to
drug
culture.
if
i
may,
quoting
from
that
81
law
review
article,
it
talks
about,
"indeed,
courts
have
been
extremely
wary
of
permitting
enforcement
discretion
in
drug
paraphernalia
cases
since
the
counterculture
connotations
associated
with
drug
use
encourage
police
decision-making
on
such
suspect
factors
as
the
age--
"
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--i
have
to
punt
on
that,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
was
a
student
at
columbia.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
only
that
it
was
published
just
recently.
"appearance,
mannerisms;
or
address
of
a
merchant
or
his
customers.
"
"such
discretionary
enforcement
based
largely
upon
whether
an
individual
looks
like
an
illegal
drug
user
offends
the
basic
notions
of
fairness.
"
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
in
egan
recognized
that
when
we
are
talking
about
lifestyle,
we
are
talking
about
manner
and
appearance
of
the
dress
or
style.
if
i
buy
a
pipe,
is
it
more
likely
to
be
used
for
a
lawful
purpose,
or
because
if
i
have
a
beard,
is
it
more
likely
that
it
will
be
used
for
an
unlawful
purpose?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may
first--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--under
this
ordinance?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
no,
your
honor,
as
i
said
in
my
brief.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
because
such
is
not
the
case.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
well,
because
in
this
case
the
plaintiff--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--well,
your
honor,
if
that
had
been
the
case,
we
would
have
had
a
different
manner
of
judging
it,
as
in
the
same
opinion
which
i
referred
to
earlier--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--well,
your
honor,
then
it
would
have
been
core
conduct,
and
the
court
would
have
had
to
judge
it
in
light
of
the
conduct
of
the
case
at
the
time
that
it
became--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--if
he
said
that
he
wanted
it?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
that
depends
on
if
in
fact
the
item
was
designed
or
marketed.
this
is
not
a
specific--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--in
the
same
way
that
if
a
customer
had
gone
into
a
grocery
store
and
purchased
a
thousand
glad
bags
or
zip-lock
bags
because
that
is
the
common
way
that
marijuana
is
distributed
in
small
amounts,
and
if
he
sold
it,
would
that
grocer
be
required
to
get
a
license?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
not
under
this
ordinance.
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
an
offense.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
under
this
ordinance,
that
would
not
be
an
application,
because
if
it
was
not
designed
in
terms
of
the
physical
structure,
or
if
it
was
not
marketed,
that
is,
they
talk
about
manner
of
display
as
being
marketing,
then
the
incident,
the
fact
that
it
would
happen
to
be
used
with
an
unlawful
substance
would
not
trigger
a
license
requirement.
if
it
was
not
pre-marketed
for
that
purpose,
then
this
law
would
still
not
be
triggered.
this
was
pre-enforcement.
they
walked
into
the
flipside
store
and
said,
this
ordinance
is
coming
into
effect,
and
you
are
covered,
so
certainly
they
don't
mean
intent,
because
they
just
determined
intent,
and
they
said,
you
are
covered,
yet
many
of
the
items
that
were...
customers
would
have
been
required
to
sign
a
police
register
purchased
at
our
store,
they
would
have
been
exempted
from
the
other
items.
they
try
to
draw
the
analogy,
your
honor,
that
this
is
like
flowers
and
milk,
but
all
the
milk
in
hoffman
estates
is
licensed,
and
so
are
all
the
flowers.
here,
they
are
just
licensing
some
of
the
corncob
pipes.
in
fact,
in
discussing
the
issues
that
were
removed,
it
was
determined
that
in
fact
the
items
identical
to
those
which
were
deemed
regulated
by
judge
layton
in
our
store
were
bought
at
other
stores.
he
said,
well,
okay,
i
made
a
mistake,
forget
79,
we
will
make
it
72.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
well,
if
we
are
going
to
talk
about
the
application
in
terms
of
the
merchant,
that
is,
i
would
concede
to
judge
hart's
question
that
it
is
appropriate
to
judge
from
the
position
of
the
plaintiff,
and
the
plaintiff
has
maintained
that
based
upon
his
experience
as
a
retailer,
none
of
the
items
which
he
sells
are
drug
paraphernalia.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
for
there
to
be,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--but
they
dealt
with
mcgowan.
they
talked
about
from
the
position
of
the
plaintiff,
which
was
the
application,
and
they
said
from
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
there
is
no
constitutional
application.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
well,
there
must
be
standards.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
and
there
must
be
standards
both
for
enforcement
and
adjudication.
it
is...
as
the
example
in
the
cohn
grocery
case,
where
it
was
said
that
as
an
example
of
unjust
or
unreasonable,
the
court
in
that
case
said
it
would
be
as
though
an
act
were
made
that
it
is
unlawful
to
commit
any
act
which
is
either
unjust
or
unreasonable,
rather,
detrimental
to
the
public
interest.
would
any
intent
have
cured
such
a
statute,
that
it
shall
be
knowingly
and
wilfully
unlawful
to
do
the
wrong
thing?
what
is
the
standard
for
enforcement
and
the
standards
for
adjudication?
in
the
screws
case,
to
set
up
a
different
case,
that
police
officer
came
before
this
court
and
said,
i
didn't
know
it
was
a
violation
of
federal
law
to
beat
a
black
handcuffed
prisoner
to
death,
i
am
sorry.
he
was
a
policeman,
a
policeman
who
was
ostensibly
trained
within
his
area.
and
he
must
come
to
this
court
and
argue
his
conduct
from
the
conduct
that
was
committed,
as
applied
to
him.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
yes,
your
honor,
the
bongs,
as
they
were
referred
to?
in
this
case
itself,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
police
officer
mauer
testified
that
in
his
experience,
he
had
seized
a
bong,
assuming
it
was
used
with
marijuana,
and
found
that
there
was
tobacco
residue.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
no,
but
it's
in
the
united
states
patent
office.
it
may
be
now.
however,
it
is
an
old
word.
i
don't
know
whether
or
not.
frankly,
i
have
never
looked,
but
i
doubt
that
it
is.
it
is,
however...
the
history
of
bongs
as
being
a
contemporary
word
for
water
pipe
was
set
out
in
the
trial
record.
several
forms
of
bongs
were
patented,
and
the
history,
the
reason
the
new
materials
were
made,
with
wood
being
more
expensive,
brass
being
more
expensive.
a
lot
of
pipes
that
people
think
they
are
smoking
that
are
wood
are
made
with
plastic.
so
i
think
the
only
issue
is,
if
a
brass
water
pipe
is
lawful,
like
pier
1
sells
and
like
many
tourists
who
come
back
from
the
east,
why
is
a
blue
one
unlawful?
i
think
that
again
we
are
talking
only
about
the
color
and
shape
of
the
pipe,
that
there
is
no
intrinsic
differences.
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
recognized
that
when
they
talked
about,
criticized
judge
manos
for
ignoring
his
own
trial
record,
where
even
the
police
agreed
with
the
pipe
expert
in
that
case,
mr.
basai,
who
testified
that
there
are
no
design
differentials
between
the
things
ostensibly
designated
as
drug
paraphernalia
in
the
enumeration
of
items
in
the
dea
act
at
that
time
and
pipes
which
are
both
historically
and
customarily
used
and
collected
and
desired
by
pipe
collectors
and
by
pipe
smokers.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
illinois
has
a
statute
which
does
that,
and
probably
many
states
did.
because,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
we
are
from
an
urban
area,
we
assume
and
automatically
associate
that
hypodermics
are
unlawful.
in
illinois
it
is
a
misdemeanor
publishable
for
up
to
a
year
to
have
or
sell
without
prescription
a
syringe.
so
only
pharmacies
may
dispense
them.
however,
in
north
dakota,
and
in
most
livestock-oriented
states,
they
are
available
over
the
counter,
and
in
those
states
they
have
a
tendency
and
custom
to
strike
hypodermic
syringe
from
enactment
of
any
drug
paraphernalia
law.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
it
is
clearly
definable.
it
lends
itself
to
a
clear
definition.
we
know
what
a
hypodermic
syringe
is.
then
i
think
its
constitutionality
must
stand
like
the
bamboo
paper
case,
on
the
overbreadth.
if
in
fact
it
reached
either
some
fundamental
right,
like
the
need
to
receive
medicine,
if
it
was
an
outright
prohibition
as
opposed
to
prescription
available,
no,
that
is
clear.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
i
believe
it
clearly
is,
because
of
the
nature
and
the
relationship
of
literature
encouraging,
for
example,
the
guidelines,
mere
proximity.
in
many
small
towns,
in
many
big
towns,
there
was
a
customary
association
between
pipe
and
book
stores,
and
very
often
they
would
have
magazines,
newspapers,
pipes,
cigarettes,
and
this
law--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--pardon?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
well,
several
things.
for
example,
there
was
much
comment
about
a
cocaine
mirror.
actually,
i
selected
it,
and
i
see
now
that
it
was
a
trial
error,
but
i
selected
it
as
evidence
because
i
assumed...
now
incorrectly,
i
suppose...
that
it
would
be
so
clear
that
if
a
child
cannot
possess
liquor,
would
it
be
unlawful
for
him
to
possess
a
schlitz
glass,
a
beer
mug
with
the
word
schlitz
on
it?
and
since
he
can't
drink,
would
it
be
unlawful
for
him
to
have
a
johnny
walker
red
mirror?
and
so
i
introduced
mirrors
of
various
different
kinds
which
were
sold
at
the
plaintiff's
store,
one
of
which
had
the
word
"cocaine"
on
it,
and
that
was
focused
upon
by
the
trial
court
as
saying,
well,
see,
it
had
the
word
"cocaine"
on
the
mirror,
that
is
drug
paraphernalia.
the
essence
of
the
decorative
mirror
has
not
changed;
although
i
wouldn't
care
for
it
to
hang
on
my
wall,
it
was
the
expression
of
their
attitude,
and
certainly
many
people
hold
the
belief
that
cocaine
should
not
be
unlawful.
they
talk
about
manner
of
display.
suppose
we
take
dunhill,
and
their
pipe
shop,
and
their
pipe
array,
and
we
add
to
that
the
posters.
does
that
change
the
marketing
aspect?
do
we
have
normal
posters,
and
liberate
marijuana,
and
those
kind
of
posters
on
the
wall?
now
we
are
displaying
the
same
merchandise,
but
have
we
changed
the
manner
of
display?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
no,
your
honor,
but
putting
a
poster
up,
arguing
that
it
should
be,
that
it
should
be
repealed,
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
changed,
you
have
changed
the
nature
of
your
inventory.
here,
i
read...
we
talked
about
literature
encouraging,
and
of
course
they
like
to
focus
on
childrens'
child
of
grass,
because
the
rhetoric
is
so
much
nicer,
and
it
sounds
good,
and
it
appeals
to
your
interest
to
stop
drug
traffic,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
are
concededly
lawful
items,
and
in
this
case
i
read
from
the
doors
of
perception,
by
aldous
huxley,
and
i
had
sigmund
freud's
letters
about
cocaine.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
they
are
ostensibly
for
animal
use.
i
don't
know
if
they
are...
i
would
assume
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
yes,
your
honor,
but
also
heroine
users
are
not
so
discriminating;
since
they
would
take
needles
and
spoons,
i
am
sure
that
they
would
take
a
much
larger,
more
inappropriate
needle
in
order
to--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--it
is
irrelevant.
the
question
of
syringes
came
because
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
if
i
thought
that
was
vague
and
i
thought
no.
we
all
know
what
a
syringe
is.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
the
statutes
do
not
differentiate
between
hypodermic
syringe
and
the
needles.
that
is,
it
does
not
make
unlawful
or
require
prescription
for
needles
of
such
a
width
or
diameter,
but
exempts
others
because
they
are
for
husbandry,
and
such
a
type
is
not
used
for
human
consumption.
it
either
bans
or
allows
all.
i
know
of
no
statute
such
as
north
dakota
which
delimits
some
and
prescribes
them
and
allows
other
either
for
human
use
with
or
without
prescription--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--it
certainly
would
not
be
vague.
whether
or
not
it
is
unlawful
is,
i
think--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--well,
but
the
question
is
to
vagueness.
certainly
the
merchant
would
know.
i
think
this
is
part
of
the
difference.
the
merchant
would
know
what
is
expected
of
him.
there
are
standards
for
compliance.
i
know
if
i
am
a
merchant
that
my
gun
has
to
be
less
than
that
amount.
the
shotgun.
we
have
the
sawed
off
shotgun
act.
i
believe
it
is
barrel
to
stock
29
inches
or
26
inches.
i
think
in
the
powell
case
it
was
22
and
a
half
inches.
so
you
know
that
there
is
something
by
which
you
can
measure
it,
so
there
is
a
standard
for
compliance,
but
adjudication?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
well,
the
point
is,
what
is
our
standard
for
compliance?
we
don't
know,
and
what
we
have
complained
about
is
that
we
did
not
know
what
designed
for
means.
and
we
are
not
so
naive
in
that,
because
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
dealing
with
design,
your
honor,
you
will
find
that
the
courts
are
split
on
it.
many
of
the
courts
argue,
and
have
held,
such
as
the
tenth
circuit,
that
design
refers
to
the
intrinsic
physical
characteristics,
if
you
will,
the
objective
reality
of
the
object.
it
is
designed
for,
and
this
is
the
object.
other
courts,
such
as
maryland,
as
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
parma,
have
held
that
design
means
the
intention,
i
design
to
use
that
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
and
that
is,
if
you
will,
the
subjective
reality,
and
how
does
one
distinguish,
when
the
object
is
lawful,
the
subjective
reality?
even
judge
manos
put
careful
cautions
and
limitations
on
enforcement
in
his
decision.
actually,
what
i
believe
judge
manos
did
was
rewrite
the
law,
write
what
he
believed
the
law
of
paraphernalia
should
be,
cautioning
against
people
inferring
or
bootstrapping,
they
said
in
normal
v.
sendak
court,
bootstrapping
and
inferring
an
unlawful
mens
ray
from
the
object
itself
and
required
that
other
circumstances
be
used
to
evidence
that
in
fact
these
objects
are
drug
paraphernalia,
holding
that
there
were
no
design
differentials,
that
they
were
in
fact
the
same
as
other
items.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
yes,
your
honor,
and
definitely
there
are
many
other
cases.
screws
was
one.
boyce.
the
acts
that
you
describe.
but
in
no
instance,
and
here
is
where
i
find
unique
dynamics
in
the
law
have
taken
place,
because
in
those
instances,
for
example,
in
burglary
tools
if
i
may
use
that
also,
sir,
what
hardware
store
could
have
filed
a
lawsuit
seeking
declaratory
judgment
of
invalidity.
he
would
have
no
standing.
the
difference
here
is
that
although
they
argued
that
there
is
no
bootstrapping
of
intent,
there
is
an
imminent,
clear,
immediate
threat
of
enforcement,
because
they
think
they
know
what
drug
paraphernalia
is.
they
have
told
us,
and
threatened
us
with
enforcement.
not
others
selling
the
same
merchandise.
in
those
cases,
i
can't
imagine
a
company
that
could
have
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
contemplating
a
merger,
and
so
they
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
holding
invalid
because
it
would
be
violative
of
their
right
to
me
the
contemplated
merger,
in
the
same
way
that
the
hardware
store
could
not
bring
a
suit,
because
it
had
no
immediate
threat
of
harm,
no
enforcement.
it
would
be,
if
you
will
no
case
or
controversy.
but
this
is
quite
difference.
and
it
was
in
all
the
cases,
in
parma,
in
ferndale,
in
egan.
in
each
case,
the
village
has
said,
this
law
applies
to
you.
we
are
going
to
arrest
you
if
you
do
not
come
into
compliance,
and
we
took
our
chance.
we
removed
all
items
in
the
department
or,
as
we
were
told,
have
the...
sign
the
police
register
for
everything,
to
be
sure.
that
is
the
type
of
clarity
we
were
given.
that
is
the
type
of
standards
for
compliance
and
adjudication.
have
them
do
it
for
everything,
just
to
be
sure.
so
we
clearly
had
standing,
because
the
threat
was
going
to
be
applied,
and
it
is
because
of
that
that
we
now
have
the
right
to
challenge
the
vagueness,
because
we
have
such
an
imminent,
real
threat
of
enforcement
that
we
may
challenge
it
based
upon
our
position,
pre-enforcement,
whereas
in
almost
all
of
those
situations,
i
cannot
conceive
of
one
where
he
could
have
challenged
it
pre-enforcement.
i
cannot
consider,
for
example,
screws
filing
a
pre-enforcement
act
to
find
that...
violating
somebody's
constitutional
rights
would
be
an
offense
prior
to
the
time.
i
am
contemplating
killing
this
guy,
but
i
want
to
know
first
if
that
is
a
violation
of
his
federal
rights.
there
is
no
real
or
imminent
threat.
he
would
not
have
had
standing
to
bring
the
action.
the
court
would
not
have
had
a
case
or
controversy.
boyce,
could
boyce
have
said,
well,
i
want
to
go
through
holland
tunnel,
maybe
i
will
explode,
maybe
i
won't
but
i
want
to
know
if
the
law,
talking
about
practicable,
and
dangerous
intersections,
is
sufficiently
clear
so
that
i
do
it
without
risk?
he
didn't.
instead,
he
drove
the
tunnel.
the
third
time
his
truck
exploded
and
60
people
were
injured.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
i
think
that
this
court
was
very
clear,
and
i
believe
stressed
heavily
the
fact
that
boyce,
the
statute
in
boyce
was
the
result
of
heavy
industry
participation,
and
several
times
in
the
opening
notes,
statement
of
the
case,
and
in
its
conclusion,
the
court
reiterated
again
and
again
the
important
role
that
truck
regulations,
and
that
those
affected
by
the
statute
had
in
participating
in
drafting
the
subject
statute.
it
was
in
fact
an
industry
participated
bill.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
no,
but
they
did
not
choose
to.
instead,
they
chose
to
violate
the
law,
and
so
they
violated
it
at
their
own
risk.
we
had
standing
and
yet
chose
not
to
violate
the
law
in
order
to
litigate
our
federal
claims,
and
so
certainly
if
boyce
had
had
standing,
then
it
would
have
been
a
different
matter.
mcgowan,
too.
mcgowan
didn't
have
to
stand
in
violation
of
the
law
and
sell
items
in
the
department
store
without
going
to
the
beach.
if
he
had
had
standing,
if
there
was
an
imminent
threat
of
enforcement,
and
he
had
otherwise
complied,
then
he
perhaps
could
have
filed
in
federal
court.
perhaps
it
would
have
been
a
situation
where
he
would
have
had
to
litigate
his
federal
claims
in
state
court,
because
there
was
no
imminent
threat.
however,
instead
he
chose
to
violate
the
law.
they
sold
stuff
on
sunday,
didn't
bother
to
litigate
their
federal
claims,
and
didn't
bother
to
go
to
the
beach.
and
certainly
somebody
maybe
shouldn't
be
responsible,
or
maybe
it's
not
constitutional
to
make
everybody
go
to
the
beach
every
sunday
to
find
out
what
by
virtue
of
popular
demand
is
being
sold,
but
he
at
least
should
have
done
it
or
sue,
but
not
just
flagrantly
violate
the
law
and
say,
well,
gee,
that
is
vague,
i
didn't
know
i
was
supposed
to
go
down
to
the
beach,
when
the
statute
set
it
out.
in
the
other
cases,
for
example,
in
the
one
case
mentioned
for
display,
danovitz,
in
the
appellate
decision
it
was
clear
that
as
a
part
of
the
array,
and
this
is
the
only
case
i
am
aware
of
where
a
marketing
case
was
found
a
a
part
of
the
array,
was
alcohol,
and
it
is
a
bootleg
case,
and
so
when
you
talk
about
the
bottles
and
corks
that
were
present
in
the
danovitz
case,
t
think
it
is
essential
when
you
read
the
feitler...
feitler
died
before
its
determination
so
it
changed
to
danovitz
in
the
supreme
court;
it
was
feitler
and
danovitz
in
the
appellate
court...
they
talked
about
the
fact
that
alcohol
was
a
part
of
array.
so
you
have
the
nexus
that
we
talked
about
in
our
brief.
this,
these
laws,
all
the
laws
dealing
with
drug
paraphernalia,
as
they
attempt
to
define
it,
are,
if
you
will,
prospective
attempts
to
reach
derivative
contraband.
it
is
anticipatory
in
nature.
on
the
one
hand
they
argue
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
drug
paraphernalia
per
se.
and
so
intent
is
necessary
to
clear
vagueness.
on
the
other
hand,
they
say,
there
is
a
$3
billion
business
in
drug
paraphernalia,
and
it
is
specific
things,
and
these
things
are
drug
paraphernalia.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
first,
i
do
not
concede
that
intent
is
required.
in
fact,
one
of
the
portions
of
my
brief
deals
with
that
fact.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
because
intent
does
not
give
a
standard
for
adjudication
or
compliance,
just
as
the
example
in
the
cohn
grocery
case,
where
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
do
anything
to
the
detriment
of
society.
it
still
does
not...
intent
cannot
add
a
standard,
does
not
give
somebody
notice
of
what
is
expected
of
them.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
the
standard
for
compliance
is
the
problem,
because
how
is
the
intent
inferred?
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
well,
but
again,
in
screws,
he
had
the
hard
conduct
from
which
to...
from
which
to
argue
from.
he
could
not
argue
overbreadth
where,
first
of
all,
his
conduct
was
such
that
it
clearly
was
not
first
amendment,
and
secondly,
where
in
fact
his
conduct
was
before
the
bench.
he
also
had
to
argue
as
a
merchant
does
in
his
situation
from
his
own
set
of
facts,
and
he
could
not
argue
the
vagueness
in
the
nature
of
the
conduct.
as
i
said,
the
seventh
circuit
talked
about
the
fence
case,
conduct
unbecoming
a
police
officer,
and
said,
making
it
intention,
intentionally
committing
conduct
unbecoming
to
a
police
officer
doesn't
aid
any
standard
for
adjudication.
as
i
said
in
the...
well,
in
the
cohn
grocery
case,
where
it
says
unlawful
to
do
anything
detrimental
to
the
public
interest.
would
intent
add
anything
to
that?
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
wilfully,
intentionally,
knowingly,
and
any
other
mens
ray
that
we
can
hypothecate,
to
do
anything
which
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
and
you
kick
a
cat.
some
people
think
it
is
wrong,
some
people
don't
think
it
is
wrong.
but
what
is
the
standard
for
compliance?
and
assuming
that
you
in
your
heart
think
maybe
it
was
wrong,
what
is
the
standard
for
adjudication?
how
does
one
know
if
kicking
a
cat
is
wrong
or
not?
again,
here,
when
you
say
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
sell
anything
for...
intentionally,
how
does
one
measure
it?
how
does
one
enforce
it?
suppose
that
there
were
standards--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--i
submit,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
may
affect
the
first
prong
of
the
vagueness
standard,
that
is,
standards
for
compliance.
i
think
that
it
doesn't
affect
the
second.
in
the
first
circuit
decision
in
smith
v.
gogan,
they
talked
about
conduct
which
was
outwardly
indistinguishable.
a
person
who
is
a
protester,
who
has
disdain
for
the
flag,
holding
the
flag
over
his
head
and
letting
it
be
rained
upon.
and
doing
it
out
of
disdain,
as
opposed
to
a
legionnaire
filled
with
grief
over
having
to
let
the
flag
get
wet,
but
committing
the
same
conduct,
where
intent
or
the
action...
certainly
you
are
intentionally
holding
the
flag
over
your
head.
merchants
intentionally
offer
these
things
for
sale,
and
that
is
where
the
confusion
has
arisen,
because
people
intentionally
hold
things
out
for
sale,
as
the
plaintiff
here.
we
intentionally
held
out
for
sale.
we
knowingly
held
them
out
for
sale.
we
denied
that
they
were
drug
paraphernalia.
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
it
is
the
model
drug.
uniform
implies
a
committee
of
experts
as
opposed
to
a
administrative--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--the
model
itself
is
such
a...
not
such
a
model.
in
fact,
the
agency
itself--
mr.
michael
l.
pritzker
--it
is
completely
different.
i
think
that
consideration
of
this
case
does
not
necessarily
touch
upon
that
case,
because
i
believe
that
intent
is
not
an
issue
here.
i
believe
that
the
logic
of
the
position
may
affect
that,
but
it
is
not
binding.
that
is,
this
case
is
separate
from
that
case.
