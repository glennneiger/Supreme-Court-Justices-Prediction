justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
village
of
hoffman
estates
enacted
an
ordinance
regulating
the
sale
of
drug
paraphernalia.
the
ordinance
requires
a
business
to
obtain
a
license
if
the
business
sells
any
items
that
are
"designed
or
marketed
for
use
with
illegal
cannabis
or
drugs."
the
flipside,
a
record
store
that
also
sells
novelty
devices
challenged
the
ordinance
prior
its
enforcement
arguing
that
the
law
is
facially
overbroad
and
vague.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
law
is
unconstitutionally
vague
on
its
face.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
law
is
neither
facially
overbroad
nor
vague.
the
law
does
not
significantly
infringe
the
first
amendment
rights
of
flipside
or
of
other
parties.
the
law
is
also
not
facially
vague
since
it
clearly
applies
to
some
of
flipside's
conduct.
flipside
unquestionably
sold
roach
clips
and
pipes
that
are
specially
designed
for
marijuana
use.
flipside
did
sell
some
items
that
are
designed
for
use
with
illegal
drugs.
furthermore,
flipside
intentionally
displayed
these
items
and
either
drug-related
items
together
in
its
store.
thus,
it
clearly
has
“marketed”
some
issues
for
use
with
illegal
drugs.
although
the
law
is
not
vague
on
its
face,
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
risk
of
discriminatory
enforcement
is
insignificant,
but
the
village
may
take
steps
to
minimize
that
risk.
but
in
this
pre-enforcement
challenge,
the
rise
--
risk
is
too
speculative
toward
in
validating
the
law
on
its
face.
where
the
drug
paraphernalia
laws
are
wise
or
effective,
it
is
not
of
course
the
problems
of
this
court.
we
only
hold
that
such
legislation
is
constitutional
if
it
does
not
reach
constitute
and
protected
conduct
if
it
is
reasonably
clear
as
applied
to
the
complainant.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
