unknown
speaker
but
if
you
disregard
the
licensing
requirement,
you
are
subject
to
criminal
penalties,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
to
you
if
you
are
found
guilty?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
a
criminal--
unknown
speaker
--did
the
court
of
appeals
think
that
vagueness
considerations
apply
to
civil
statutes?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
if
you
can
identify
some
article
under
this
ordinance
that
any
fool
would
know
is
covered
by
it?
is
that
the
end
of
the
inquiry?
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
isn't
it?
and
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
it
is
facially
invalid?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
said
it
was
vague.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
is
vague
in
the
sense
that
you
couldn't
tell...
you
couldn't
identify
any
object
that
was
clearly
covered
by
the--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
they
said.
well,
what
if
they
were
wrong
on
that.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
were
wrong
that
there
is
at
least
one
object
that
you
can
identify?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
counsel.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
advertising
them
for
sale
and
holding
them
out
for
sale,
except
that
you
have
the
articulation
in
the
newspaper
ad
or
whatever?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
mr.
williams,
have
you
previously
interpreted
the
ordinance
to
include
a
scienter
requirement?
unknown
speaker
was
it
argued
below,
the
intent
element?
unknown
speaker
would
you
explain
what
sort
of
intent
element
you
would
see
in
this
ordinance?
i
mean,
what
kind
of
intent?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
then
infer
intent
from
the
product's
design
or
the
manner
of
display?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
scienter
requirement
then
really
doesn't
add
to
the
existing
ordinance,
if
that
is
what
it
means,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
just
an
intent
to
market.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
counsel,
that
if
you
prevail
here,
this
would,
to
use
a
common
phrase,
chill
some
people
from
selling
these
articles.
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
general
idea
of
the
city.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
freeze
is
what
you
really
would
want.
unknown
speaker
did
the
expert
say
how
many
people
smoke
it
that
way?

[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
would
you
mind
referring
to
the
ordinance
itself
as
set
forth
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
on
page
48(a),
subsection
(a),
and
tell
me
if
that
is
a
misprint
or
if
that
is
how
the
ordinance--
unknown
speaker
--(a),
license
reguired.
it
refers
to,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
sell
items,
paraphernalia,
accessory,
or
thing
which
is
designed
by
illinois
revised
statutes?
unknown
speaker
has
that
been
corrected
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
an
omission
in
the
jurisdictional--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
have
you
changed
the
ordinance
at
all
since
the
inception
of
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
not
a
word.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
was
there
some
warning
issued?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
at
the
time
this
case
was
filed,
was
it
clear
what
the
village's
claim
was?
unknown
speaker
however
vague
the
ordinance
might
have
been
without
some
administrative
construction,
you
administratively
construed
it
to
what?
unknown
speaker
to
cover
items
that
were
being
sold?
unknown
speaker
so
that
at
that
time
there
was
not
much
question
about
what
you
thought
was
covered
by
the
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
this
is
not
a
criticism
of
you,
but
it
is
of
your
printer.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
speaking
of
the
table
of
cases
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
think
they
ought
to
be
alphabetized
and
not
serialized.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
cite
that
you
just
gave
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
pritzker,
what
do
you
do
with
justice
holmes
language
in
the
nash
case
in
229,
where
he
says
that
the
law
is
full
of
instances
where
a
man's
fate
depends
on
his
estimating
rightly,
that
is,
as
the
jury
subsequently
estimates
it,
some
matter
of
degree?
unknown
speaker
who
is
the
author
of
that
article?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
know
who
wrote
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
mr.
pritzker,
the
proprietor
of
flipside
is
in
the
store,
and
two
people
come
in
and
say,
we
use
marijuana
considerably,
we
would
like
to
have...
and
tells
him
some
specific
item
that
they
want
to
use
in
connection
with
using
marijuana,
in
which
case
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
use
is
going
to
be,
and
if
mr.
flipside
sells
the
article
requested,
would
there
be
any
question
in
his
mind
or
could
there
be
that
the
ordinance
would
forbid
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
or
not?
would
there
be
any
question
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
so,
how
can
the
ordinance
be
vague
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
there
could
be
all
sorts
of
circumstances
where
there
would
be
no
question
whatsoever
but
what
the
ordinance
would
cover
some
particular
sale,
but
the
seventh
circuit
says
it
could
never
be
applied
constitutionally.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
have
said
it
was
vague.
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
no
question
in
my
example
that
the
ordinance
covered
that
particular
conduct.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
marketed
it,
and
you
knew
exactly
what
the
use
was
going
to
be,
you
were
marketing
it
for
use.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
my
example.
in
my
example
a
proprietor
is
told
precisely
what
the
use
is
going
to
be.
unknown
speaker
but
in
justice
white's
example,
the
proprietor
is
told.
unknown
speaker
don't
retailers
at
whom
these
ordinances
are
addressed
have
some
knowledge
of
their
own
business
so
that
they
know
what
a
head
shop
is
and
the
kind
of
things
that
are
sold
in
head
shops?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
seventh
circuit
had
decided
on
that,
if
it
said,
this,
the
ordinance
as
applied
to
this
particular
piece
of
goods
is
vague,
nobody
could
possibly...
if
that
is
all
the
seventh
circuit
said,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
they
have,
as
i
understand
their
judgment,
there
is
no
conceivable
valid
application
of
this
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
vague.
unknown
speaker
if
the
issue
would
have
been,
could
you
tell
if
a
meerschaum
pipe
is
covered
by
this
ordinance,
it
might
be
vague
with
respect
to
a
pipe,
but
that
isn't
what
the
seventh
circuit
held.
unknown
speaker
the
seventh
circuit
held
there
is
no
conceivable--
unknown
speaker
--let's
leave
the
pipe
aside.
what
about
these
water
gadgets,
water
pipes,
or
whatever
they
are
called.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
webster's
international?
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
ordinance,
instead
of
reading
the
way
it
did,
had
simply
regulated
the
sale
of
hypodermic
needles?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was,
if
the
ordinance
read
as
i
posited,
that
the
sale
of
hypodermic
needles
was
unlawful,
would
you
say
that
was
vague?
unknown
speaker
overbreadth
isn't
involved
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
expression
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
what
expression
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
hold
the
belief
that
the
sale
of
morphine
ought
to
be
lawful,
does
that
make
the
harrison
act
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
you
back
to
north
dakota
for
a
minute.
what
kind
of
syringes
are
there
that
are
sold
over
the
counter
in
north
dakota?
for
human
use
or
animal
use?
unknown
speaker
they
are
quite
a
bit
different
from
an
ordinary
hospital
syringe,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
help
your
case,
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
syringe
out
in
the
cattle
country,
in
the
farm
country
is
quite
a
different
animal
from--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
think
it
would
be
unlawful
if
there
was
an
ordinance
or
a
statute
that
prohibited
the
public
display,
sale
without
a
license
of
pistols
with
barrels
less
than
five
inches?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
lawful
instrument
if
a
policeman
is
using
it,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
your
attack
has
been
on
the
licensing
process,
in
part.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
robinson-patman
act,
or
other
antitrust
acts?
certainly
there
is
a
lot
of
language
in
there
that
people
cannot
be
absolutely
certain
whether
they
are
complying
or
not.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
in
boyce
there
would
have
been
standing
to
litigate
a
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wouldn't
go
to
standing
to
litigate
a
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
if
intent
is
required,
why
doesn't
that
save
the
statue?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
it
is
implied.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
think
the
ordinance
would
be
invalid
if
it
were
interpreted
as
meaning
that
somebody
who
sells
any
of
these
items
which
he
intends
be
used
with
illegal
drugs
is
an
invalid
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
like
any
other
kind
of
intent.
like
in
screws.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
separate
problem,
but
it
would
certainly
seem
to
affect
the
vagueness
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pritzker,
would
your
position
also
invalidate
the
uniform
drug
paraphernalia
bill?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
mean
that.
the
model.
unknown
speaker
where
you
have
to
guess.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
it
would
have
some
impact
on
your
case
if
along
with
all
this
paraphernalia
they
had
a
sign
reading
generally,
forget
your
troubles,
escape
from
your
anxieties,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
they
put
it
with
the
paraphernalia.
unknown
speaker
it
would
aid
the
inference
of
intent,
you
think.
