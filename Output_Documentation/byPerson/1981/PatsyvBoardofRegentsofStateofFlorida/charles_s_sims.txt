mr.
charles
s.
sims
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
plaintiffs
in
1983
actions
can
generally
be
required
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
despite
this
court's
consistent
and
repeated
holdings
that
such
exhaustion
is
not
required,
despite
clear
congressional
recognition
of
and
reliance
on
those
holdings,
and
despite
the
absence
of
any
historical
basis
to
support
a
change
in
this
court's
longstanding
construction
of
section
1983.
unlike
most
cases
that
come
before
the
court,
this
case
pronounced
not
a
new
issue,
but
an
old,
previously
settled
one
and
respondents
have
not
come
near
to
making
the
sort
of
showing
required
to
justify
a
change
in
settled
statutory
construction.
the
case
is
here
more
than
three
years
after
petitioner
first
filed
a
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court
in
florida
under
section
1983
alleging
unlawful
employment
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
14th
amendment.
the
plaintiff
has
sought
injunctive
relief
and
damages.
there
have
been
no
proceedings
on
the
merits
and
no
discovery.
the
district
court
granted
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
the
fifth
circuit
initially
reversed
that
decision,
relying
on
this
court's
cases,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reheard
the
case
en
banc
and
decided
that
1983
plaintiffs
would
henceforward
be
required
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
under
traditional
exhaustion
standards.
this
court's
holdings
to
the
contrary
were
distinguished.
the
court
remanded
for
a
hearing
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
particular
remedies
available
to
this
plaintiff,
and
she
thereupon
sort
certiorari
here,
and
either
summary
reversal
in
light
of
recent
legislation
of
which
the
fifth
circuit
had
apparently
not
been
aware,
or
plenary
consideration
which
this
court
granted.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
i
had
not
noticed
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
dissenting
opinions
in
the
court
of
appeals
plainly
set
forth
the
basis
on
which
they
thought
the
question
had
been
foreclosed
before
this
court
in
any--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--i
do
not,
your
honor.
the
rule
against
required
exhaustion,
which
this
court
has
announced
and
adhered
to
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
is,
of
course,
not
etched
in
stone.
our
submission
is
that
in
light
of
congressional
action
in
1871
and
more
recently,
that
it
is
written
into
law.
the
question
here
is
not
one
of
policy.
instead,
it
is
what
congress
has
meant.
the
imposition
of
an
exhaustion
requirement
onto
section
1983
would
be
a
revision
of
that
statute,
and
statutory
revision
is
a
matter
for
congress,
not
for
the
court.
i
plan
to
address
here
the
three
principal
reasons
why
exhaustion
cannot
be
required
under
section
1983.
first,
because
of
this
court's
cases
in
stare
decisis.
second,
because
of
recent
congressional
action;
and
third,
because
it
is
violative
of
the
intention
of
the
42nd
congress.
of
course,
this
court's
non-exhaustion
precedents
do
not
themselves
prevent
the
court
from
changing
its
mind
in
deciding
that
it
has
misconstrued
the
statute.
but
neither
can
they
simply
be
ignored,
as
respondents
have
ignored
them.
they
form
the
background
against
which
this
case
must
be
decided,
and
they
impose
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
on
those
who
would
change
the
rule.
the
court
has
held
in
six
cases,
all
either
unanimous
or
eight
to
one,
that
exhaustion
cannot
be
required
under
1983
itself.
it
has
repeated
that
holding
in
eight
additional
cases
without
qualification.
just
this
term,
in
fair
versus
mcnary,
every
member
of
the
court
subscribed
to
that
proposition.
and
two
terms
ago,
in
board
of
regents
versus
tomanio,
when
the
court
held
that
state
statutes
of
limitations
would
not
be
tolled
pending
exhaustion,
the
court
reasoned
that
such
tolling
would
be
appropriate
only
where...
as
was
not
the
case
under
1983...
congress
itself
had
required
resort
to
administrative
remedies.
in
short,
the
rule
against
required
exhaustion
has
not
just
been
frequently
repeated
and
applied;
it
is
part
of
the
fabric
of
this
court's
1983
jurisprudence.
moreover,
their
construction
was
not
lightly
reached.
pertinent
history
for
the
1871
congress
was
before
the
court
in
mcneese,
as
it
had
been
somewhat
more
fully
before
nearly
the
same
court
two
terms
before
in
monroe.
the
consequences
of
the
rule
were
fully
pointed
out
by
justice
harlan
dissenting
in
mcneese
and
damico.
and
judge
friendly's
famous
attack
on
the
rule
in
eisen
versus
eastman
was
squarely
before
this
court
at
least
in
carter
versus
stanton
in
1972.
the
indiana
officials
in
that
case
relied
squarely
on
eisen.
arguments
based
on
eisen
were
before
this
court
at
oral
argument,
and
eisen
itself
was
being
fully
considered
by
the
court
in
another
case
that
term,
its
other
principal
holding
being
reversed
in
lynch
versus
household
finance.
beyond
their
significance
as
precedent,
however,
mcneese
and
its
progeny
assume
an
overriding
importance
here,
because
congress
has
accepted
and
relied
on
those
cases.
even
if
the
court's
original
construction
in
mcneese
were
dubious,
congressional
knowledge
of
that
decision
and
acquiescence
in
it
would
require
that
further
alterations
be
made
by
congress.
significantly,
although
congress
was
plainly
aware
of
that
rule,
it
did
not
seek
to
alter
it
when
it
amendment
1983
in
1979
for
the
first
time
in
a
century
to
reverse
this
court's
somewhat
restrictive
decision
in
district
of
columbia
versus
carter,
although
congress
did
re-emphasize
the
vital
role
of
1983...
and
i
quote
from
the
conference
report...
"in
providing
a
neutral
federal
forum
for
resolution
of
civil
rights
complaints.
"
as
this
court
has
held
in
united
states
versus
rutherford
and
in
the
red
lion
case,
once
an
authoritative
statutory
construction
has
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
and
congress
has
not
sought
to
change
that
construction,
although
amending
the
statute
in
another
respect,
then
presumably
the
legislative
intention
was
correctly
discerned.
but
retention
of
the
rule
is
required
here
for
reasons
far
stronger
than
simple
congressional
acquiescence.
congress
has
not
just
acquiesced.
it
has
built
and
relied
upon
the
rule
in
a
way
that
precludes
its
reversal.
acting
with
the
full
knowledge
that
1983
plaintiffs
could
not,
under
present
law,
be
generally
require
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
congress
passed
a
law
a
year
and
a
half
ago
authorizing
exhaustion
in
certain
1983
actions
under
narrow
and
specified
conditions.
in
section
7
of
the
civil
rights
for
institutionalized
persons
act,
42
usc
1997e,
congress
authorized
courts
to
defer
consideration
of
some
1983
cases
for
a
maximum
of
90
days,
in
suits
brought
by
certain
adults
convicted
of
crime.
the
statute
applies
only
to
those
who
are
in
institutions
which
have
adopted
particular
grievance
resolution
procedures
in
compliance
with
minimum
procedures
set
forth
by
congress
and
promulgated
in
somewhat
greater
detail
by
the
attorney
general.
four
important
points
stand
out
from
the
legislation
history
of
1997e,
and
from
its
design.
first,
the
legislative
history
makes
absolutely
clear
that
congress
knew
the
non-exhaustion
rule
was
settled
law.
sponsors
repeatedly
called
it
settled
law.
representative
kastenmeier
said
that
the
statute
was
necessary
to
permit...
that
was
his
word...
exhaustion
which
was
not
allowed
under
current
law.
and
the
conference
report
used
similar
language.
representative
wiggins,
one
of
the
republic
sponsors
of
the
bill,
indicated
that
some
in
congress
would
have
preferred
a
broader
rule,
but
he
acknowledged
the
impossibility
of
mustering
a
majority
in
congress
to
do
so.
second,
congress
was
not
just
looking
at
a
small
portion
of
a
problem
without
attention
to
1983
generally.
the
general
problem
of
1983
filings
in
federal
courts
was
a
major
focus
of
congressional
concern.
congress
knew
that
prison
filings
which
this
court
had
held
and
were
wording,
were
subject
to
the
same
standards
as
all
other
1983
cases
under
current
law
with
the
largest,
single
category
of
1983
cases
burdening
the
federal
courts,
and
by
far
the
most
burdensome
because
of
their
generally
pro
se
nature.
aware
of
that
entire
problem,
congress
decided
to
deal
with
it
piecemeal,
one
step
at
a
time,
by
attacking
its
major
source.
third,
congress
was
extremely
and
deliberately
selective.
it
did
not
require
exhaustion
for
all
1983
cases,
or
even
for
all
1983
cases
that
generally
fell
within
the
purview
of
the
civil
rights
for
institutionalized
persons
act.
instead,
only
certain
claims,
those
of
adults
convicted
of
crime,
or
in
particular
institutions
which
had
adopted
particular
demanding
grievance
resolution
procedures,
were
subject
to
exhaustion.
and
even
as
to
them,
only
those
complaints
having
to
do
with
conditions
of
confinement
were
subject
to
exhaustion.
congress
was
thus
not
hostile
to
the
rule
generally.
instead,
it
made
a
small
exception
to
the
rule
because
it
decided
that
prisoner
cases
posed
a
unique
problem
warranting
a
unique
solution.
finally,
and
most
importantly,
congress
built
on
the
non-exhaustion
rule
for
its
own
special
purposes.
congress
rejected
a
proposal
to
subject
prisoners
to
general
exhaustion
requirements
such
as
those
imposed
on
1983
by
the
fifth
circuit
below,
and
last
year
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
case
which
was
vacated
by
this
court,
jenkins
versus
brewer.
the
motivating
concern
was
not
federalism,
or
even
having
as
many
1983
cases
as
possible
efficiently
resolved
at
the
local
administrative
level.
traditional
exhaustion,
which
congress
rejected,
would
have
accomplished
that.
instead,
congress
used
this
new
exhaustion
requirement
for
some
1983
cases,
as
an
inducement,
a
carrot
you
will,
to
achieve
particular
substantive
goals
as
a
matter
of
national
policy.
the
non-exhaustion
rule
is
thus
not
just
the
background
against
which
this
case
must
be
decided.
it
was
the
principal
justification
for
1997e,
and
indispensable
for
its
effectiveness.
congress
would
not
have
passed
1997e
if
exhaustion
was
already
permitted
under
1983.
more
importantly,
reading
a
general
exhaustion
requirement
into
1983
would
render
the
statute
a
dead
letter.
only
on
the
premise
that
1983
cases
cannot
already
be
subject
to
exhaustion
does
the
inducement
mechanism
that
congress
created
make
sense.
the
states
have
no
reason
to
adopt
the
particular
procedures
congress
meant
to
foster
if
their
1983
prison
cases
are
already
subject
to
exhaustion.
in
short,
we
think
that
1997e
makes
this
case
even
easier
than
its
predecessors.
the
legislative
history
shows
far
more
than
passivity
and
silence.
instead,
it
shows
that
congress
has
accepted
the
rule
and
built
on
it.
congress
has
put
itself
directly
in
the
business
of
deciding
when
and
to
what
extent
and
under
what
conditions
exhaustion
will
be
required.
in
these
circumstances,
further
alteration
of
the
rule
is
plainly
a
matter
for
congress.
as
the
court
held
in
the
alyeska
pipeline
case,
when
congress
begins
making
an
exception
to
a
general
rule,
even
a
general
rule
which
is
completely
judiciously
created,
further
adjustments
should
be
left
to
congress.
whatever
the
needs
for
courts
to
engage
in
interstitial
adjustment
with
a
hundred-year
old
statute
untouched
by
congress
and
unconstrued
by
the
courts,
surely
the
courts
need
not
and
should
not
intervene
once
congress
has
placed
a
problem
on
its
agenda
and
begun
addressing
it.
by
adopting
an
exhaustion
requirement
in
reliance
on
the
very
policy
considerations
that
congress
is
in
the
current
business
of
weighing,
the
fifth
circuit
usurped
the
legislative
rule.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
no,
that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
no.
the
court
in
younger
and
its
progeny
has
made
plain
that
it
did
not
think
that
what
it
was
doing
was
inconsistent
with
what
congress
generally
wanted.
and
the
equity
practice
which
younger
adopted
has
been
part
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
dating
back
to
the
1790's.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
younger
is
rather
recent,
but
it
relied
on
a
series
of
cases
dating
a
long
way
back.
and
the
questions
as
to--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--younger
says
that
if
the
state
has
already
brought
a
case
against
you
and
that
case
is
before
a
court,
then
the
federal
court
should
defer
to
the
court
that
already
has
that
case.
that
is
a
very
different
matter
than
1983
in
this
particular
action
when
there
is
no
proceeding
pending
either
in
court--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--in
the
younger
case
and
every
other
case
which
followed
younger,
there
has
been
a
pending
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
here,
there
is
not
only
not
a
judicial
proceeding,
there
is
no
pending
administration
proceeding.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
well,
there
might
be,
but
congress
has
plainly--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--well,
it
depends
on
the
sort
of--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--i
think
under
section
1983
he
would
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
of
course,
congress
could
change--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--i
think
congress
could
change
that
rule
if
it
wanted
to.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
i
think
there
are
many
plaintiffs
who
have
1983
actions
who
find
that
that
is
so
with
the
particular
agencies
they
are
dealing
with.
and
those
people,
i
am
sure,
are
well
advised
to
go
through
their
administrative
remedies.
there
is
no
indication
that
people
do
not
do
that.
but
this
plaintiff
did
not
think
that
the
administrative
remedies
were
adequate.
and
we
think
that
congress
gave
her
a
right
to
make
that
choice.
a
few
words
about
the
legislative
history.
read
against
the
background
of
this
court's
cases,
we
think
that
1997e
is
controlling
because
even
if
the
court
got
1983
completely
wrong
in
mcneese,
the
fact
is
that
congress
has
relied
on
it.
as
the
court
said
in
similar
circumstances
in
cannon
against
university
of
chicago,
when
congress
acts
in
reliance
on
one
of
this
court's
statutory
constructions,
the
question
is
no
longer
whether
congress
misperceived
the
law,
but
rather,
what
its
perception
was.
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
court
needs
to
perpetuate
its
own
mistakes
to
give
effect
to
more
current
legislation.
the
fact
is
that
the
court
got
1983
right
the
first
six
times
around,
as
the
lopsided
decisions
in
those
cases
should
suggest.
respondents
argue
only
that
the
42nd
congress
could
not
have
said
anything
on
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
because
in
their
view,
there
was
no
law
concerning
exhaustion
in
the
federal
courts
as
of
1871.
their
argument
misconceives
both
the
state
of
the
law
in
1871
and
the
principal
themes
of
the
legislative
debate.
first,
the
notion
of
exhaustion
was
not
unknown
to
the
42nd
congress.
the
very
year
that
congress
passed
1983
in
united
states
against
clyde,
this
court
had
held
that
federal
courts
were
without
any
power
to
require
exhaustion
unless
congress
had
expressly
done
so.
in
another
case
that
year,
the
collector
against
hubbard,
the
court
there
applied
a
statutory
exhaustion
requirement,
but
indicated
that
if
congress
had
not
expressly
provided
that
requirement
by
statute,
the
court
would
have
been
powerless
to
impose
it.
in
fact,
congress
had
imposed
exhaustion
requirements
in
1857,
1866,
1868
and
1871.
in
short,
there
was
clear
exhaustion
law
in
1871,
and
the
law
was
no
exhaustion
unless
congress
had
expressly
provided
for
it.
as
with
the
question
of
immunities
and
res
judicata--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
it
did,
your
honor,
but
the
question
here
is
what
the
intention
of
the
42nd
congress
was.
and
for
that
purpose,
i
think
the
court
needs
to
focus
on
what
the
law
was
in
1871,
and
not
what
it
later
became.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
court
in
the
bethlehem
versus
myer
case
paid
very
close
attention
to
the
particular
administrative
proceeding
that
congress
had
established.
and
as
one
of
its
principal
justifications
for
applying
the
exhaustion
rule
in
that
case,
it
said
that
it
was
obviously
consistent
with
what
congress
did,
and
an
aid
to
the
accomplishment
of
congress's
purpose;
that
is,
that
congress
had
set
up
deliberately
a
particular
administrative
proceeding,
and
the
court
was
only
helping
congress
along
by
making
sure
that
it
was
not
bypassed.
that
is
plainly
not
the
case
here.
as
with
immunities
and
the
res
judicata
questions
which
this
court
has
focused
on
in
previous
years,
congress
in
1871
should
be
understood
to
have
acted
against
the
background
of
the
settled
law
at
the
time.
second,
as
to
the
debates
themselves,
not
only
is
the
conclusion
of
mcneese
not
plainly
wrong,
as
would
be
required
to
reverse
the
non-exhaustion
rule,
it
was
plainly
right.
the
debates
in
1871
strongly
suggest
that
if
an
exhaustion
requirement
had
been
placed
before
congress,
it
would
have
been
squarely
rejected.
the
debates'
responses
have
repeatedly
described
their
goal
as
providing
a
prompt
federal
judicial
remedy
in
federal
court.
representative
elliot
explained
that
1983
provided
for,
quote,
"the
immediate
jurisdiction"
of
the
federal
courts
without,
and
i
quote,
"the
appeal
or
agency
of
the
state.
"
opponents
like
representative
storm
opposed
1983
precisely
because
it
takes
the
whole
question
away
from
the
states
in
the
beginning.
senator
blair
explained
that
section
1
superseded
state
officials.
representative
kerr
complained
that
it
transferred
jurisdiction
from
state
tribunals
to
those
of
the
united
states.
representative
arthur
complained
that
it
swallowed
up
state
institutions,
tribunals
and
functions.
representative
swan,
another
opponent,
focused
on
precisely
this
point.
he
complained
that
it
ignored
state
tribunals.
section
1
was
the
centerpiece
of
a
vast
transformation
of
power
and
of
federalism
enacted
by
congress
after
the
civil
war
that
this
court
has
frequently
reviewed.
the
very
model
that
congress
relied
on,
prigg
versus
pennsylvania,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
monell,
makes
clear
how
inconsistent
required
exhaustion
would
be
with
what
congress
was
doing.
under
prigg,
critical
federal
rights...
in
that
case,
the
rights
of
southern
slaveholders...
could
be
enforced
directly
in
federal
court
without
the
interference
of
state
officials.
after
the
civil
war,
of
course,
congress
was
interested
in
a
very
different
set
of
rights.
but
for
safety's
sake,
and
to
make
sure
that
its
meaning
would
not
be
lost,
it
relied
on
the
prigg
model
with
its
direct
enforcement
of
federal
constitutional
rights
free
from
any
opportunity
of
state
interference,
obstruction,
hindrance
of
delay.
justice
story's
opinion
for
the
court
in
prigg
said
that
it
would
make
impermissible
even
state
laws
that
would
complement
congressional
legislation
by
auxiliary
provisions
for
the
same
purpose.
the
42nd
congress
intended
to
provide
for
the
prompt
federal
judicial
protection
of
constitutional
rights.
subsequent
congresses
have
not
waivered
from
that
goal.
the
court
should
give
effect
to
that
choice,
to
its
own
decisions
and
to
the
subsequently
expressed
will
of
congress...
the
rule
1983
itself
does
not
generally
require
exhaustion...
and
reverse
the
judgment
below.
if
there
are
no
further
question
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
i
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
it
has
not
been
briefed
before
this
court,
although
it
was
raised
at
the
petition
for
certiorari
stage.
the
court
has
entertained
cases
against
state
universities
and
board
of
regents
many
times
over
the
past
few
years...
the
tomanio
case--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--well,
the
plaintiff,
of
course,
asked
for
both
injunctive
relief
and
damages.
the
board
of
regents
is
a
body
corporate.
i
think
that
makes
some
difference.
in
addition,--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--well,
this
board
is
a
body
corporate.
i
would
believe
that
would
make
some
difference,
your
honor.
in
addition,
with
regard
to
the
damages
question,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
in
support
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
there
are
substantial
funds
that
the
university
has
which
are
neither
derived
from
the
state
nor
placeable
by
the
university
with
the
state.
and
as
the
edelman
case
makes
clear,
that
leaves
at
least
the
question
of
fact
regarding
whether
or
not
the
judgment
here
would
come
from
the
state,
within
the
meaning
of
the
edelman
case.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
if
there
were
an
11th
amendment
problem
it
would
be
jurisdictional,
although
since
there
have
been
no
proceedings,
the
plaintiff
would,
i
believe,
be
free
to
refile
and
amend
the
complaint.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
well,
there
have
been
no
proceedings.
i
mean,
she
tried
to
move
forward
with
all
deliberate
speed.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
just
briefly,
your
honor.
a
brief
point
on
the
11th
amendment
point
that
has
concerned
some
members
of
the
court.
i
would
agree
with
my
colleague
that
the
question
would
probably
be
open
on
remand.
and
if
this
court
hold
that
exhaustion
is
not
permitted,
the
case
then
goes
back
down
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings,
and
they
have
raised
the
question
already,
and
it
could
at
that
point
be
decided
by
the
district
court.
because
there
are
some
particular
aspects
about
the
way
this
case
is
framed...
that
is,
this
board
of
regents
is
a
body
corporate
rather
than
a
state
agency,
and
in
addition,
the
fact
that
it
may
stand
in
the
same
position
as
the
universities
or
boards
in
delaware
state
college
versus
ricks,
tomanio
case,
the
horrowitz
case,
the
roth
case,
bacci
case
and
others.
i
would
think
that
since
that
question
has
not
been
raised
here,
and
a
judgment
need
not
be...
a
final
judgment
entered
against
the
state
here...
that
the
court
could
decide
the
exhaustion
question
before
it
and
leave
the
11th
amendment
question
for
the
lower
court
to
address.
in
addition,
with
regard
to
damages,
there
is
a
recent
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
or
the
eleventh
circuit,
at
666
fed
2d,
505,
that
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
the
particular
finances
of
this
university,
the
fact
that
they
have
extensive
funds
which
are
not
derived
from
the
state
or
required
to
be
kept
in
a
state
treasury,
unlike
their
other
funds,
is
relevant.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
suggested
that
that
was--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--we
are
seeking
on
the
merits
equitable
relief
and
damages,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
under
korn
versus
jordan
i
would
not
think
so,
your
honor.
with
regard
to
the
other
points
raised,
i
think
they
were
all
policy
questions,
and
as
we
have
indicated,
we
think
those
are
for
congress,
not
for
the
courts.
unless
there
are
further
questions?
