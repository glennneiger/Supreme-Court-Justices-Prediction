mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
below
and
its
adoption
of
a
flexible
exhaustion
rule.
we
contend
that
this
is
a
procedure
with
a
relief
oriented
result
without
substantial
denial
of
anyone's
rights.
let
me
state
what
some
of
the
things
that
23
flexible
exhaustion
does
not
do
as
annunciated
below.
one,
it
does
not
displace
1983
as
a
basis
of
jurisdiction
or
federal
review.
it
does
not
prevent
federal
judicial
review.
it
does
not
diminish
ultimate
relief,
if
necessary,
in
the
federal
court.
it
does
not
thwart,
in
our
opinion,
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
1983
back
in
1871.
it
does--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
think
that
that
was
a
recognition
of
congress
that
the
courts
needed
some
assistance
in
providing
for
a
means
of
addressing
those
grievances--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--no.
to
the
contrary,
i
think
it
is
an
indication
or
a
possible
indication
of
congress's
reliance
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
that
provides
for
other
proper
proceedings.
in
this
case,
they
provided
for
them
statutorily.
but
at
least
they
recognize
that
there
is
the
deferral
to
the
states.
and
i
think
there
is
an
indication
there
of
their
desire
to
require
exhaustion
in
these
circumstances
and
to
provide
a
mechanism
by
which
the
courts...
i
mean,
the
states,
and
the
agencies
that
are
concerned
to
address
those
particular
problems.
i
do
not
see
it
as
being
dispositive
or
the
final
word
that
only
congress
can
address
the
non-exhaustion
rule.
i
do
not
feel
that
that
is
substantial
support
for
the
ironclad
no
exhaustion
rule.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
yes.
it
was
raised
below
in
the
district
court,
it
was
not
addressed
by
the
district
court,
it
was
not
addressed
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
case
was
not
briefed
here.
the
issue
that
we
responded
to
was...
on
the
certiorari...
as
to
whether
or
not
the
exhaustion
rule
should
be
reversed.
but
yes,
there
is
an
11th
amendment
issue.
however,
we
feel
that
this
particular
issue
of
exhaustion
transcends
the
patsy
and
the
state
of
florida,
and
is
one
that
should
be
addressed
by
this
court.
and
it
does
not...
the
adoption
of
a
flexible
exhaustion
remedy
does
not
require
the
overruling
of
prior
decisions.
i
will
not
bore
you
with
a
recitation
of
those,
but
they
are
outlined
in
both
the
amicus
brief
that
we
filed...
or
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
respondent,
as
well
as
an
analysis
of
the
case
law
and
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
below.
and
to
respond
to
justice
blackmun's
question
as
to
why
the
members
of
the
original
panel
may
have
reversed
themselves,
i
would
suggest
that
a
possible
reason
is
that
there
was
an
opportunity
for
them
to
be
persuaded
that
exhaustion
or
no
exhaustion
is
not
required,
and
it
is
not
an
ironclad
rule.
and
that
by
analyzing
the
previous
decisions
of
this
case,
you
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
exhaustion
may
be
a
procedural
rule
that
can
be
adopted
by
the
court
and
is
consistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
no,
your
honor.
only
the
state
legislature--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--may
waive
the
11th
amendment.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
they
have
waived
the
11th
amendment
only
in
selected
tort
cases
under
our
statute.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that
issue
was
never
addressed
as
to...
the
11th
amendment
was
never
addressed--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--no,
we
were...
yes,
we
were
the
appellees.
the
appellee
the
first
time,
before
the
original
panel,
but
we
were--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
as
i
indicated,--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--well,
it
was
briefed,--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--yes,
your
honor.
it
was
not
briefed
or
argued
en
banc.
only
at
the
original...
briefed
at
the
original
panel.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
i
cannot
subscribe
to
that,
your
honor,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
that
issue
was
considered
by
that
court.
and
certainly,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
address
it.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
no,
your
honor,
we
have
not,
because
of
the
grant
of
certiorari.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
we
are
asking
you
to
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
for
the
reasons
that
they
stated
in
their
opinion,
which
we
feel
are
supportable
by--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--there
is
still
an
11th
amendment
issue
that
somewhere
will
have
to
be
briefed
and
will
have
to
be
litigated
because
the
board
of
regents
is
indeed
an
agency
or
an
instrumentality
or
entity
of
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
we
need
not
reach
that
issue,
your
honor,
because
we
need
not
reach--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--it
will
not
get
litigated
at
least
in
this
lawsuit,
and
it
need
not,
because
we
feel
that
that
is
a
constitutional--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--yes.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
there
is
the
issue
of--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
did
not
hear?
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
court
below
obviously
interpreted
the
non-exhaustion
as
a
jurisdictional
basis
as
well,
and
the
fifth
circuit
has,
at
least
in
the
roach
case--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
they
affirmed
the
district
court
in
its
ruling
as
to
no
exhaustion,
flexible
exhaustion,
is
required.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
but
it
did
not
overrule
the...
remanded
it
back
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
remedies
that
were
available
in
the
state
of
florida
were
adequate,
and
that
still
has
not
been
determined
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
there
was
oral
argument
in
both.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
no,
no.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
it
was
summary
action
that
was
argued
en
banc.
this
court
has
stated
that
you
only
retreat
or
displace
1983
for
compelling,
persuasive
reasons.
some
of
the
things
that
the
flexible
exhaustion
rule
has
annunciated
below
does...
first
of
all,
it
does
permit
the
court
to
determine
how
it
is
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
given
to
it
by
congress.
it
exercises
its
article
iii
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
ripe
for
adjudication
or
whether
the
case
is
complete
as
far
as
an
injury
is
concerned.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
florida
has
a
variable
statute
of
limitations,
but
for
back
pay
and
termination
and
so
on,
the
general
statute
of
limitations
is
two
years.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
i
would
submit
that
under
the
rationale
of
tomanio,
that
the...
if
exhaustion
is
required
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite,
that
it
would
toll
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
do
not
know
that
you
need
to
do
that,
your
honor.
i
think
the
language
is
there
that
would...
we
are
not
talking
about
two
separate
proceedings
running
concurrently
along;
we
are
talking
about
an
action
that
may
originally
go
to
the
district
court
and
if
the
rule
is
that
you
need
to
exhaust
before
coming
here
you
go
to
exhaust,
but
i
think
that
tomanio
rationale
would
support
an
equitable
tolling
so
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
believe
there
is
language
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
the
flexible
exhaustion
remedy,
if
adopted,
would--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
no,
you
honor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that
is
correct.
i
think
what
it
does--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--it
helps
determine
whether
or
not
the
case
is
ripe
for
adjudication,
is
my
point
on
that.
in
that
way,
it
assists
in
the--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--in
this
case,
for
example,
it
may
very
well
be
that
there
has
been
no
final
state
action
by
the
board
of
regents
which
would
trigger
a
1983
action.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
that
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
flexible
exhaustion
would
help
the
court
determine
whether
or
not
an
issue
is
ripe,
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
completed
action
which
would
indicate
that
there
has
either
been
a
denial
of
due
process
or
denial
of
equal
protection
or
other
constitutional
right
which
has
been
violated.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
this
is
not
a
termination
case,
your
honor.
it
is
a
non-promotion
case.
it
is
a
reverse
discrimination
action
brought
by
a
white
woman
who
alleges
that
she
was
not
promoted
because
of
the
affirmative
action
plan
that
the
university
is
under
because
of
a
court
order,
quite
frankly.
and
that
is
the
basis
of
her
complaint.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
she
had
applied
for
various
positions
and
had
not
been
selected
for
those
positions.
had
she
done
nothing
and
had
the
university
done
nothing,
it
is
presumed
that
she
would
still
be
in
her
old
job
as
a
secretary
3
or
4,
or
whatever
her
level
was.
she
would
still
be
employed
and
still
be
working.
another
reason
for
adopting
the
flexible
exhaustion
remedy
is
that
it
enhances
federalism,
it
sharpens
the
issues...
and
that
is
the
point,
justice
brennan,
that
i
indicated
helps
determine
and
makes
the
record
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
right
for
adjudication.
it
may
possibly
moot
constitutional
claims.
if
this
lady
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
promoted
to
a
position
and
she
exhausts
her
available
and
adequate
administrative
remedies,
she
may
very
well
get
that
relief.
and
accordingly,
there
would
be
no
basis
to
go
into
federal
court
and
there
would
be
no
constitutional
deprivation,
or
the
remedy
would
have
been
provided
for
her.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
i
do
not
believe
that
was
the
case,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
enactment
came
after
the
case
was
argued.
but
i
do
recall
that...
i
seem
to
recall
that
that
point
was
discussed
in
one
of
the
dissents.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
i
think
it
helps
us,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
as
consistent
with
the
plain
language
in
1983
of
other
proper
proceedings...
there
have
no
interpretation
of
that
particular
phrase
of
1983,
and
it
is
an
indication,
along
with
numerous
others
on
the
part
of
congress,
to
defer
to
the
states
and
to
give
the
states
the
opportunity
to
correct
any
wrongs
that
may
have
been
made
or
may
have
been
perceived
to
have
been
made.
i
also
think
that
congress
has
indicated
a
willingness
to
defer
to
the
state
by
their
enactment
in
1988.
i
am
not
talking
about
the
attorney's
fees
portion,
but
that
portion
which
states
that
you
will
decide
the
issues
on
the
basis
of
state
law.
certainly,
1988
is
contrary
to
the
position
of
appellant
that
we
have
got
one
rule,
when
if
we
are
applying
the
statute
of
limitations
in
50
jurisdictions
plus,
and
we
are
applying
the
substantive
and
procedural...
not
procedural,
but
law...
of
50
plus
states,
it
certainly
does
not
necessarily
bring
for
a
single,
orderly
body
of
law
for
the
federal
judiciary
to
consider.
there
is
another
reason
for
adopting
the
flexible
exhaustion
remedy,
and
that
is
the
plain
language
of...
as
i
indicated,
the
plain
language.
monroe
tells
us
that
there
are
three
bases
of...
for
congress
to
have
adopted
the
1871
civil
rights
act
to
overrule
existing
state
law,
and
they
were
not
particularly
concerned
with
that.
it
is
to
provide
a
remedy
where
one
was
available,
and
it
is
to
provide
a
remedy
where
one
is
available
in
theory
but
not
in
practice.
we
have
come
a
long
way
since
1871.
times
have
changed
to
the
point
where
congress,
i
think,
is
recognizing,
along
with
the
administration,
that
states
can
and
should
handle
these
matters.
the
plain
language
provides
for
other
proper
proceedings.
the
federal
courts
are
supplementary
to
those
remedies
that
are
available
in
the
states,
whether
they
are
administrative...
particularly
administrative...
but
that
does
no
mean
that
they
are
predominant.
and
if
these
issue
can
be
addressed
in
the
context
of
federalism,
then
they
should
be
done
so.
one
other
point
on
1997.
i
indicated
that
this
was
a
response
to
the
crisis
that
congress
perceived,
and
as
i
indicated,
it
does
permit
the
deferral
of
action
to
the
states.
and
as
noted
by
the
case
below,
there
is
certainly
no
displacement
of
1983.
it
is
a
deferral,
and
it
does
permit
administrative
agencies
to
address
those.
i
indicated
that
it
does
not
require
overruling
prior
decisions,
and
i
think
that
the
commentaries
in
chicago
and
harvard
law
review
articles
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
are
indications
of
how
the
fifth
circuit
reached
the
result
that
they
did
below.
and
finally,
this
requiring
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
and
basing
it
upon
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
upon
federalism
and
all
of
the
other
compelling
persuasive
reasons
i
have
listed
provides
for
speedy
relief.
for
example,
professor
clark,
in
55
south
cal
law
review,
has
done
a
statistical
analysis
of
the
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
20th
century,
and
it
turns
out
that
the
average
case,
including
all
of
those
that
are
dismissed,
is
settled
in
1.16
years.
now,
this
case
has
been
on--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--disposed
of.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
disposed
of
in
1.16
years.
now,
this
case
has
already
been
in
litigation
for
over
three
years
and
we
still
have
not
gotten
to
the
merits.
any
case...
it
is
our
experience
and
opinion
that
any
case
that
is
going
to
go
to
trial
takes
an
enormous--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
do
not
believe
that
it
can,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
certiorari
was
granted
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
fifth
circuit
was--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--it
is
a
cloud
hanging
over
this
particular--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--well,
if
you
rule...
if
you
rule
with
me,
it
has
still
got
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
remedies
that
were
available
are
adequate.
even
if
you
affirm
the
fifth
circuit.
and
i
am
urging
that
upon
you
because
the
case
still
has
to
go
back
at
least
on
that
portion.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
provides
for
a
rule,
and
it
is
a
procedural
rule,
that
this
court
can
adopt
based
upon
the
statutory
guidance
given
by
the
congress.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that
issue
was
raised
below--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
have
no
authority,
your
honor,
to
stand
here
and
waive
the--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
i
am
representing
the
state
in
this
litigation,
but
i
have
no
authority
under
the
laws--
mr.
mitchell
