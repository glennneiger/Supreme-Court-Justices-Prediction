mr.
sims,
the
three
judges
on
the
original
panel
all
joined
the
majority
on
the
rerun,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
the
originals...
well,
each
of
them
switched
sides.
i
wondered
if
you
had
an
explanation
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
carried
out
to
your
logical
conclusion
in
your
argument,
younger
against
harris
should
be
overturned.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
is
not...
but
i
would
think
it
is
the
logical
extension
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
younger
is
rather
recent.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
younger
just
says
you
have
to
go
exhaust
your
judicial
remedies
that
are
already
started.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
brings
a
1983
suit
and
he
gets
it
dismissed
because
the
plaintiff
should
take
his
complaints
into
the
state
court,
where
he
already
is.
unknown
speaker
yes,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but
there
might
be.
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
would
not
come
out
any
different
if
there
was
an
administrative
proceeding
pending.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
started
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
and
got
tired
of
it
and
went
to
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
yes,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
pending
or
not.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
they
might
get
a
complete
and
adequate
remedy
at
the
first
administrative
level.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
law
changed
some
as
we
come
down
closer
to
the
20th
century--
unknown
speaker
--in
cases
like
myers
versus
bethlehem
shipbuilding--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
myers,
i
do
not
know
that
the
court
focused
unduly
on
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
just
focused
on
general
principles
which
the
judiciary
had
established
by
then
governing
exhaustion.
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
one
question.
can
you
tell
me
what
the
florida
statute
of
limitations
is
applicable
to
a
case
like
this?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
is
there
any
11th
amendment
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
only
party
is
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
you
ask
for
half
a
million
dollars
of
damages.
i
would
wonder--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
sued
the
members
of
the
board
individually
you
could
have
had
injunctive
relief,
but
can
you
have
it
against
the
board
itself,
officially,
if
it
is
an
agency
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
an
11th
amendment
problem,
it
would
be
jurisdictional
if
it
were
decided
against
you,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
amend
the
complaint
at
this
time?
unknown
speaker
what
significance
does
the
act
of
congress
have,
giving
limited
exhaustion
requirement
for
persons
in
institutions,
which
was
passed
recently?
unknown
speaker
is
it
some
indication,
in
your
view,
that
at
least
congress
thought
there
was
not
an
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
which
the
courts
had
imposed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
an
11th
amendment
problem
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
going
back
to
the
11th
amendment...
a
state
can
waive
the
11th
amendment,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
legislature?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
applicable.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
for
failure
to
exhaust,
right?
unknown
speaker
that
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
address
it,
but
if
you
were
on
the
down
side,
you
were
an
appellee
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand.
but
you
were
supporting,
trying
to
support,
the
district
court's
judgment.
unknown
speaker
and
you
could
have
supported
it
by
pressing
the
11th
amendment.
unknown
speaker
did
you
press
it
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
on
your
side.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
issue
was
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals,
they
must
have
rejected
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
raised
it
here?
you
have
not
argued
it
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
have--
--well,
do
you
want
us
to
decide
the
11th
amendment
point
or
not?
unknown
speaker
because
i
just
want
to
remind
you
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
something
without
any
briefing
by
anybody.
unknown
speaker
so,
for
once
we
will
earn
our
money.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
said
the
11th
amendment
was
still
here.
unknown
speaker
if
we
decide
in
your
favor,
how
will
it
get
litigated?
unknown
speaker
it
will
not
get
litigated.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
so
how
can
we
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
if
we
have
not
got
any
jurisdiction
to
hear
it?
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
decided
it
without--
unknown
speaker
--and
could
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
have
decided
it
if
there
is
a
jurisdictional
barrier
to
even
entertaining
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
overturned
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
oh,
that
is
right.
they
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
before
the
panel
decision,
which
is
a
very
brief
two
or
three
pages,
was
there
oral
argument
then,
or
was
there
only
oral
argument
before
the
en
banc
decision?
unknown
speaker
both
cases.
unknown
speaker
this
was
one
of
their
summary
actions.
unknown
speaker
on
this
question
of
ripeness,
could
you
tell
me
in
your
view
when
does
the
statute
of
limitations
start
to
run
for
the
1983
client?
unknown
speaker
and
does
it
begin
to
run
before
or
after
the
exhaustion
process
takes
place?
unknown
speaker
are
you
asking
us
to
reconsider
tomanio,
as
that
is
really
what--
unknown
speaker
--you
said
tomanio
would
support
an
equitable
tolling?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
did
i
understand
you
to
suggest
earlier
that
really
by
flexible
exhaustion,
you
are
only
talking
about
ripeness?
unknown
speaker
only
talking
about
ripeness?
unknown
speaker
they
are
different
things.
flexible
exhaustion
rule
and
ripeness?
unknown
speaker
you
made
a
reference
to
ripeness,
and
i
just--
unknown
speaker
--well,
ripeness
would
mean,
i
take
it,
that
if
the
case
is
not
ripe
because
something
had
not
been
completed,
then
there
would
be
no
into
the
federal
court
under
1983
until
the
case
became
ripe.
isn't
that
what
ripeness
means?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
mean
by
ripeness?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
happen
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
if
instead
of
going
into
the
federal
court
at
the
time
she
did,
everyone
had
simply
done
nothing?
she
would
still
be
fired,
wouldn't
she?
unknown
speaker
if
everyone
had
done
nothing
after
the
initial
decision
not
to
promote
her,
i
take
it
that
decision
would
have
stood,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
was
the
question
about
congress's
most
recent
enactment
for
institutional
defendants
presented
to
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
and
argued
by
the
parties?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
act
helps
you
or
hurts
you?
unknown
speaker
you
say
settled.
disposed
of.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
how
in
the
world
can
this
case
get
to
the
merits
without
the
state
surrendering
its
sovereignty?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
we
doing?
just
going
through
motions?
unknown
speaker
but
now
the
10th
amendment
has
been
raised
in
argument.
it
is
here.
unknown
speaker
a
cloud?
if
we
rule
with
you,
fine.
if
we
rule
against
you,
then
we
litigate
it.
unknown
speaker
you
were
quite
content
with
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
and
when
you
lose,
then
you
will
raise
the
sovereign
immunity
point.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
it
is
tempting
to
accommodate
you.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
get
the
authority?
you
were
there,
you
represent
the
state.
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
asked
for
it.
don't
you
represent
the
state?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
attorney
general
have
the
right
to--
unknown
speaker
--ask
for
legislation?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
he
have
the
right
to
ask
the
legislature?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
requesting
some
equitable
relief,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
the
11th
amendment
would
not
be
a
bar
to
your
prayer
for--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
