mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
on
petitions
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
en
banc
court
below
affirmed
the
labor
board's
decision
that
the
construction
unions
involved
in
this
case
did
not
violate
section
8(b)(4)(a)
of
the
labor
act
by
picketing
to
obtain
certain
restrictive
union-only
subcontracting
provisions
which
are
commonly
called
subcontractor's
clauses
because
both
the
court
and
the
board
believed
that
such
provisions
were
protected
by
the
construction
proviso
to
section
8(e)
of
the
labor
act.
two
questions
are
thus
presented
to
the
court.
first,
are
subcontractor's
clauses
always
valid
under
the
construction
proviso
simply
because
they
are
contained
in
a
lawful
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
employer?
second,
can
a
union
lawfully
picket
to
obtain
such
clauses?
we
believe
the
answer
to
both
questions
is
no.
we
hope
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
labor
board's
decision
and
the
court
below's
decision
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
to
section
8(e)
of
the
labor
act,
and
contrary
to
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
connell
construction,
which
was
decided
by
the
court
in
1975.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
fairly
straightforward.
the
petitioner,
woelke
and
romero,
had
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
with
the
unions,
and
in
1977,
as
the
most
currently
contract
to
which
it
was
party
was
about
to
expire,
engaged
in
bargaining
for
a
successor
contract.
during
the
negotiations,
the
unions
proposed
the
subcontractor
clauses
for
woelke
and
romero
to
execute.
woelke
and
romero
refused.
an
impasse
in
bargaining
developed,
and
in
support
of
the
union's
provisions,
the
unions
picketed
various
job
sites
to
which
woelke
and
romero
at
that
time
was
working.
woelke
filed
appropriate
charges
with
the
labor
board,
and
this
litigation
ensued.
first,
i
think
the
court
should
understand
what
kind
of
subcontracting
provisions
these
are.
these
are
not
provisions
which
restrict
subcontracting
simply
to
the
bargaining
unit.
in
other
words,
these
provisions
prevail
upon
the
employees
and
employers
outside
the
bargaining
unit.
thus,
these
provisions
clearly
do
not
say
that
woelke
and
romero
may
not
subcontract
work
or
may
not
subcontract
work
if
its
employees
are
on
layoff.
these
provisions
simply
tell
the
employer
which
employers
it
may
otherwise
do
business
with.
they
apply
to
the
work
only
of
the
contracting
union.
they
name
the
particular
union
with
which
the
subcontractor
must
be
party.
they
apply
to
all
job
sites
of
the
contractor
or
subcontractors.
they
apply
to
all
tiers
of
subcontracting,
and
they
apply
in
futuro
to
all
job
sites
without
regard
to
the
presence
or
absence
of
union
members
on
particular
job
sites.
they
apply
to
the
entire
geographic
area
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
they
simply
do
not
do
anything
other
than
to
assist
the
construction
unions
who
are
party
to
the
clauses
in
their
organizing
attempt
in
that
geographic
area.
thus,
in
order
for
a
subcontractor
to
be
eligible
to
compete
for
the
contractor's
work,
he
must
agree
to
sign
the
same
exact
union
contract
to
which
the
contractor
is
party,
and
that
subcontractor's
employees
must
designate
the
particular
union
that
is
mentioned
in
the
subcontractor
clause
in
order
for
their
employer
to
be
eligible
to
do
the
work.
we
believe
that
these
kinds
of
clauses
have
serious
antitrust
and
labor
implications.
although
this
is
not
an
antitrust
case,
the
court
should
recognize
the
breadth
of
the
boycott
that
is
involved.
the
contractor
is
precluded
from
doing
work...
or
the
subcontractor
is
precluded
from
doing
work
unless
he
is
party
to
that
contract.
the
boycott
extends
beyond
what
we
believe
is
any
legitimate
union
purpose.
the
clauses
seek
to
regulate
the
working
conditions
and
the
market
area
of
the
construction
union
involved.
as
this
court
noted,
labor
policy
does
not
require
that
a
union
have
freedom
to
impose
direct
restraints
on
competition
among
those
who
employ
its
members.
we
believe
that
that
is
what
these
clauses
in
effect
do.
further,
the
labor
policy
implications
of
these
clauses
are
that
the
union
in
effect
has
a
broad
top-down
organizing
tool
which
is
contained
in
the
union
contract,
which
again,
we
believe,
is
contrary
to
the
connell
decision
of
this
court
in
1975,
and
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent
in
1959.
in
1959,
congress
passed
section
8(e)
to
the
labor
act.
it
added
that
section
to
the
act
with
the
purpose
of
trying
to
prevent
secondary
boycott
agreements.
in
1958,
this
court
in
its
decision
in
sandor
had
held
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
a
voluntary
agreement
contained
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
conducted
a
secondary
boycott
against
other
people,
the
union
could
not
use
coercive
pressure
to
enforce
that
agreement.
in
1959,
in
enacting
section
8(e)
to
the
act,
congress
intended
to
interdict
those
agreements
to
conduct
secondary
boycotts.
as
far
as
the
construction
industry
is
concerned,
however,
congress
granted
a
limited
exception
to
construction
unions.
in
doing
so,
they
limited
that
exception
to
subcontracting
or
contracting
of
work
at
particular
job
sites
and
did
not
give
construction
unions
otherwise
a
right
to
engage
in
organizing
from
the
top
down.
by
definition,
top-down
organizing
is
used
by
the
construction
unions
to
organize
the
employer
rather
than
the
employees
of
that
employer.
in
other
words,
the
union
puts
pressure
on
the
employer
to
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
employer's
employees
may
not
want
to
be
represented
by
the
union.
that
kind
of
top-down
organizing
was
interdicted
both
by
section
8(e),
as
far
as
most
other
industries
are
concerned,
but
also
by
other
labor
act
provisions,
specifically
section
8(b)(7)
and
also
by
strengthening
section
8(b)(4)
of
the
labor
act.
to
the
extent
that
the
construction
proviso
to
8(e)
gives
the
construction
unions
an
exemption,
it
would
be
contrary
to
that
legislative
intent
to
permit
top-down
organizing
by
that
proviso.
rather,
since
the
construction
proviso
to
section
8(e)
was
intended
in
part
to
overrule
this
court's
1951
decision
in
denver
building
trades,
it
is
clear
in
our
judgment
that
the
proviso
to
section
8(e)
only
exempts
those
otherwise
secondary
provisions
which
would
be
within
the
prohibition
to
section
8(e)
which
are
related
to
the
denver
building
trades'
interests.
what
are
those
interests?
those
interests
are
to
prevent
the
alleviation
of
the
job
site
tension
on
particular
job
sites
that
may
develop
between
union
and
non-union
workers.
but
it
is
only
those
particular
job
sites
at
which
union
and
non-union
workers
are
working
where
that
job
site
friction
may
develop.
therefore,
unless
the
union
has
an
identifiable
dispute
at
a
particular
construction
project
where
and
when
union
and
non-union
workers
are
working
side
by
side,
there
is
no
legitimate
interest
sheltered
by
the
proviso
that
should
give
a
construction
union
the
right
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
broad
boycott.
a
construction
union
does
not
need
a
top-down
organizing
subcontracting
restriction
in
order
to
alleviate
that
interest.
it
does
not
need
to
require
the
contractor
to
specify
to
the
subcontractor
which
union
that
subcontractor's
employees
must
designate
as
their
bargaining
representative
in
order
to
be
eligible
to
compete
for
the
work
at
that
project.
our
adversaries,
the
respondents
in
this
matter,
argue
that
the
construction
industry
proviso
had
more
than
one
purpose.
they
argue
that
congress
intended
by
their
proviso
to
preserve
a
pattern
of
collective
bargaining
which
they
say
existed
prior
to
1959.
we
do
not
believe
the
legislative
history
or
this
court's
previous
decision
in
connell
supports
that
argument.
rather,
this
court
apparently
dismissed
that
argument
in
1975,
for
that
argument
is
based
solely
on
one
small
reference
in
the
legislative
history
by
senator,
later
president
kennedy,
in
which
he
said
that
the
proviso
was
added
to
avoid
serious
damage
to
the
pattern
of
collective
bargaining.
there
was
no
further
expression
in
the
legislative
history,
in
any
of
the
committee
reports,
as
to
that
purpose.
completely
opposite
to
the
labor
board's
interpretation
of
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
is
the
manner
in
which
the
proviso
was
added
to
section
8(e).
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
we
dispute
that
it
was
a
pattern
that
this
clause
was
in.
we
acknowledge
that
the
construction
unions,
even
as
far
back
as
1941,
had
such
provisions
in
some
contracts
throughout
the
united
states,
but
the
number
of
such
contracts
is
by
far
very
small,
a
few
contracts.
the
board
relies
upon
a
study
called
the
london
study,
which
was
done
in
1961,
two
years
after
the
statute
was
passed,
which
found
that
some
clauses
did
exist.
the
general
counsel
of
the
nlrb,
in
reviewing
that
study
in
1976,
concluded
that
there
was
no
pattern,
that
the
most
that
could
be
said
was
that
there
was
a
mosaic
of
types
of
subcontracting
restrictions.
the
labor
board
now
argues,
however,
that
that
mosaic
somehow
or
other
has
been
transformed
into
a
pattern.
we
disagree
with
that.
the
labor
board
also
argues
that
the
clauses
must
be
valid
in
order
for
construction
unions
to
maintain
the
continuity
of
fringe
benefits
and
to
protect
the
job
opportunities
of
construction
workers.
that
may
be
a
very
laudatory
goal,
but
it
is
not
one
that
finds
any
support
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
construction
proviso
to
section
8(e).
if
a
construction
union
needs
to
protect
its
job
opportunities,
it
can
do
so
without
the
broad
restraints
involved
in
these
kinds
of
subcontractor
clauses.
it
can
negotiate,
for
example,
to
preserve
job
opportunities,
that
a
construction
employer
shall
not
subcontract
work
ever.
now,
perforce,
that
preserves
the
job
opportunities
of
the
bargaining
unit
employees.
it
can
negotiate
a
provision
that
says,
as
long
as
a
majority
of
the
work
force
of
the
contractor's
employees
are
working,
the
employer
may
subcontract
out
work,
but
if
that
subcontracting
will
produce
another
layoff
so
that
less
than
a
majority
of
the
bargaining
unit
would
be
working,
subcontracting
would
be
prohibited.
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
broad
top-down
organizing
clauses
which
name
particular
unions
as
the
beneficiaries
of
those
clauses
are
not
necessary
to
preserve
job
opportunities.
furthermore,
the
work
preservation
test
that
this
court
has
previously
adopted
indicates
that
such
kinds
of
work
preservation
goals
are
primary
goals,
goals
which
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
prohibition
to
section
8(e)
in
any
event.
if
section
8(e)'s
proviso
is
an
exception
to
the
secondary
thrust
of
section
8(e)
overall,
then
the
preservation
of
job
opportunities
can
be
done
by
provisions
which
are
not
within
even
the
general
scope
of
section
8(e)
of
the
labor
act.
in
other
word,
the
preservation
of
job
opportunities
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
section
8(e)
or
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
to
that
section.
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
white,
and
we
believe
that
our
arguments
are
persuasive
on
that
point.
the
board
has
not
been--
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
--that's
correct.
if
we
analyze--
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
--in
my
judgment,
there
is
only
one
way
to
construe
that
particular
proviso.
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
yes.
i
believe
that
in
light
of
this
court's
previous
decisions
in
various
labor
cases,
that
the
court
is
persuaded
that
as
long
as
the
board's
construction
of
the
statute
is
reasonable
and
in
accord
with
the
legislative
intent,
that
we
should...
or
the
court
should
defer
to
it.
we
believe,
however,
that
the
legislative
history
clearly
does
not
support
the
board's
position.
the
nub
of
this
matter
is
really
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
proviso
and
the
legislative
history
behind
it.
we
believe
the
board's
interpretation
cannot
stand.
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but
this
court
has
previously
done
so
in
two
decisions,
national
woodwork
and
in
connell,
where
the
court
took
the
position
that
a
thing
may
not
be
within
the
statute
because
not
within
the
intent
of
its
makers,
notwithstanding
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
and
relying
on
the
court's
previous
judgments
along
that
line,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
literal
wording
of
the
statute
should
not
be
read.
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
the
board
has
maintained
the
rule
that
a
union
can...
that
a
union
can
picket
to
obtain
these
clauses
since
the
early
sixties.
originally,
in
its
decision
in
colson
and
stevens,
the
board
found
that
such
provisions
could
not
be
obtained
by
picketing
but
could
only
be
entered
into
voluntarily.
when
three
circuits
disagreed,
the
board
changed
its
rule,
and
it
has
existed
that
way
since
roughly
1964.
when
this
case
was
argued
before
the
nlrb,
counsel
for
one
of
the
parties
in
the
consolidated
argument
addressed
the
issue.
at
that
point,
there
was
nothing
for--
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
--as
i
recall,
it
was
mentioned.
but
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
object
to.
there
was
no
labor
board
intermediate
decision.
there
was
no
finding
of
fact.
there
was
no
conclusion
of
law.
there
was
no
remedy
for
woelke
and
romero
to
have
objected
to
prior
to
that
point
in
time.
in
fact,
it
appeared
to
be
a
settled
point
of
law
before
the
board.
the
board
had
previously
considered
the
argument
in
colson
and
stevens,
and
previously
considered
the
argument
in
centilever.
for
us
to
have
raised
that
theory
once
more
would
have
been
a
completely
vain
act,
given
the
fact
that
the
board
for
at
that
point
about
15
years
had
considered
the
issue
settled.
we
raised
it
before
the
court
of
appeals,
knowing
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
contrary
rule
to
our
position,
but
to
preserve
it
for
supreme
court
review.
if
anybody
can
be
considered
to
have
waived
this
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
labor
board
and
the
unions
should
be
considered
to
have
waived
any
objection
to
the
consideration
before
this
court.
they
did
not
object
to
the
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals,
not
once
did
they
do
so,
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
heard
it
twice.
mr.
john
w.
prager,
jr.
we
don't
believe
that
that
rule
applies
where
the
board
in
the
first
instance
is
the
factfinder
and
decision-maker,
and
where
the
board
relies
upon
a
previously
established
rule
as
the
basis
for
its
decision.
the
right
to
picket
to
obtain
the
clauses
in
our
judgment
does
not
exist.
the
board's
construction
of
section
8(b)(4)(a)
in
our
judgment,
as
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
is
inaccurate.
further,
frankly,
our
view
that
you
cannot
picket
to
obtain
these
subcontractor
clauses
is
consistent
with
the
board's
rule
that
you
cannot
picket
to
obtain
a
non-mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
it
is
only
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
that
can
be
obtained
by
virtue
of
picketing.
this
clause,
since
it
regulates
the
labor
conditions
of
employers
outside
the
bargaining
unit,
is
considered
to
be
by
the
board
a
non-mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
as
a
consequence,
section
8(b)(3)
of
the
act
should
interdict
such
picketing.
however,
the
board
has
created
an
anomaly
in
the
law
by
saying,
although
it
is
a
non-mandatory
subject
of
bargaining,
we
believe
that
section
8(b)(4)(a)
gives
the
union
the
right
to
picket
to
obtain
it.
we
believe
it
is
more
consistent
with
the
legislative
history,
with
the
policies
announced
in
sandor
that
an
employer
must
be
free
from
coercion
with
respect
to
these
kinds
of
boycotts,
and
consistent
with
the
board's
rules
concerning
non-mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
that
a
union
cannot
be
heard
to
say
that
it
has
a
right
to
picket
to
obtain
the
clause.
in
conclusion,
we
believe
that
the
court
should
declare
the
union's
conduct
in
this
case,
as
well
as
the
clauses,
illegal.
thank
you.
