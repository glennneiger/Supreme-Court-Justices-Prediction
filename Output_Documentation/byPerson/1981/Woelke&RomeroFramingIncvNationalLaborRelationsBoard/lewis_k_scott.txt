mr.
lewis
k.
scott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
connell
case,
the
subcontractor
clause
prohibited
the
general
contractor
from
doing
business
with
any
plumbing
subcontractor
that
did
not
have
a
labor
contract
with
plumbers
local
100.
now,
the
general
contractor,
connell
construction
company
in
that
case,
did
not
itself
employ
any
plumbers
at
any
time
on
any
of
its
jobs.
this
court
held
in
connell
that
that
subcontractor
clause
was
not
within
the
purpose
of
the
proviso,
and
therefore
not
within
the
proviso.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
exactly.
now,
if
connell
construction
company
had
itself
employed
just
a
couple
of
plumbers
on
just
one
job
for
just
a
couple
of
months,
and
if
plumbers
local
100
had
put
the
very
same
subcontractor's
clause
in
a
full
labor
contract
covering
just
those
two
plumbers,
then,
according
to
the
rule
of
the
labor
board
and
of
the
court
below,
that
subcontractor
clause
would
be
lawful,
and
it
would
apply
at
all
times
on
all
jobs
of
connell
construction
company
throughout
the
life
of
the
contract.
furthermore,
according
to
the
rule
of
the
labor
board
and
of
the
court
below,
plumbers
local
100
could
picket
connell
construction
company
to
force
connell
to
agree
to
that
clause,
the
very
same
clause.
now,
the
effect
of
that
same
subcontractor
clause
at
all
times
on
all
of
connell's
jobs
except
for
just
that
two-month
period
on
that
one
job
where
connell
employed
the
two
plumbers
would
be
indistinguishable
from
the
effects
of
the
subcontractor's
clause
in
connell.
at
all
such
times,
the
subcontractor
clause
would
operate
as
a
broad
organizational
weapon,
organizing
from
the
top
down
the
subcontractor's
employees
by
use
of
a
secondary
boycott,
and
at
all
such
times
without
any
redeeming
virtue
based
on
the
close
community
of
interests
at
the
particular
job
site
involved.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
at
that
job,
and
at
that
job
only--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--the
clause
would
be
invalid
on
its
face
as
long--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--no,
it
would
be
our
position,
your
honor,
that
unless
the
clause
itself
provides
that
it
is
confined
to
those
situations
where
the
union
has
its
members
employed
by
the
general
contractor--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--well,
perhaps
we
are
dealing
with
niceties
that
in
practice
wouldn't
matter.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
certainly
our
essential
position
is
that
the
clause
would
be
legal
only
in
those
situations
where
the
general
contractor,
at
the
time--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--employed
members
of
the
union.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
recognize
the
rule
of
deferring
to
expertise
of
the
board.
on
the
other
hand,
i
submit
that
the
essential
question
is
the
purpose
of
congress,
and
not
the
literal
statute,
and
i
would
suggest
that
under
all
the
circumstances,
as
we
describe
in
our
brief,
that
expertise
has
very
little
play
in
this
particular
case.
the
subcontractor
clause
in
this
particular
case,
that
is,
the
one
between
local
701
and
oregon
agc,
is
in
substance
identical
to
the
subcontractor
clause
in
connell.
it
prohibits
the
general
contractors
from
doing
business
with
any
subcontractor
performing
covered
work
that
does
not
have
a
labor
contract
with
local
701.
it
applies
at
all
times
on
all
jobs
of
all
the
200
agc
contractors
throughout
the
state
of
oregon
and
southwest
washington
for
the
entire
five-year
life
of
the
contract,
and
with
respect
to
all
the
jobs
of
all
of
those
general
contractors
when
they
do
not
themselves
employ
members
of
local
701,
the
effect
of
this
clause
is
indistinguishable
from
the
effect
of
the
clause
in
connell.
it
operates
as
a
broad
top-down
organizing
weapon,
by
means
of
a
broad
group
secondary
boycott,
and
without
any
redeeming
virtue
based
upon
the
close
community
of
interests
at
the
particular
job
site.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
your
honor--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
that's
right,
and
it
is
my
understanding
it
was
presented
and
considered
and
rejected
by
the
court
in
connell.
the
labor
board
and
the
court
below
seek
to
distinguish
connell
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
the
general
contractor,
connell,
and
the
union,
whereas
in
our
case
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
the
general
contractor
and
the
union.
the
error
in
this
position
is
demonstrated
by
looking
at
the
very
tenuous
and
insubstantial
nature
on
many
occasions
of
a
collective
bargaining
relationship,
and
the
very
broad
consequences
that
under
the
rule
of
the
board
and
the
court
below
attached
to
that
collective
bargaining
relationship.
this
can
best
be
shown,
i
believe,
by
looking
at
a
very
simple
specific
example.
the
labor
contract
between
local
701
and
these
agc
general
contractors
covers
the
operation
of
every
conceivable
kind
of
heavy
construction
equipment.
now,
a
particular
general
contractor
may
himself
employ
members
of
local
701
only
occasionally
and
for
very
discreet
purposes.
for
example,
a
particular
general
contractor
may
employ
members
of
local
701
only
to
operate
forklifts
on
a
particular
job
to
move
lumber
for
just
a
couple
of
months
on
that
one
job,
and
only
on
that
occasion
throughout
the
entire
five-year
life
of
the
contract.
that
particular
general
contractor
may
always,
historically,
and
in
every
situation
subcontract
out
all
other
work
that
involves
the
operation
of
heavy
construction
equipment.
he
at
all
times
subcontracts
out
all
the
excavation
work
that
includes
the
operation
of
a
shovel
and
a
front-end
loader,
subcontracts
out
all
of
the
underground
utility
work
that
includes
the
operation
of
a
backhoe.
he
always
subcontracts
out
all
of
the
concrete
laying
work
that
involves
the
operation
of
a
concrete
pump,
always
subcontracts
out
the
hoisting
where
operation
of
a
crane
is
involved,
subcontracts
out
all
of
the
sprinkler
fitter
work
that
involves
a
mobile
scaffold
or
a
forklift
uses
the
mobile
scaffold,
subcontracts
out
all
of
the
landscaping
work
involving
the
use
of
other
heavy
construction
equipment
involved,
subcontracts
out
all
of
the
paving
work
and
the
driveway
work
involving
the
use
of
graders
and
rollers
and
pavers.
now,
that
general
contractor
does
have
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
with
local
701.
it
employed
a
couple
of
its
members
on
a
job
for
a
month.
the
consequence
of
this,
according
to
the
labor
board,
is
that
the
subcontractor
clause
is
valid,
and
it
applies
at
all
times
on
all
the
general
contractor's
jobs
throughout
the
five-year
life
of
the
contract,
and
that
general
contractor
is
prohibited
from
doing
business
with
any
subcontractor
whose
employees
perform
any
of
this
work
of
operating
any
of
that
equipment
unless
that
subcontractor
has
a
labor
contract
with
local
701,
and
that
labor
contract
requires
all
of
the
employees
of
that
subcontractor
performing
that
kind
of
work
on
any
of
the
subcontractors'
jobs
throughout
the
life
of
the
contract
to
be
members
of
local
701,
and
to
designate
local
701
as
their
representative.
and
furthermore,
according
to
the
rule
of
the
board,
and
of
the
court
below,
local
701
can
picket
this
general
contractor
to
force
him
to
agree
to
this
clause.
it
is
submitted
that
the
legality
of
a
union's
right
to
top-down
organize
subcontractors'
employees
by
means
of
a
secondary
boycott
on
all
these
other
jobs
at
all
these
other
times
cannot
reasonably
depend
on
whether
the
general
contractor
employs
at
some
time
on
some
job
one
or
two
members
some
place
of
local
701.
surely,
that
is
not
what
congress
intended,
yet
that
is
the
rule
of
the
board.
this
court
stated
in
both
national
woodwork
and
also
in
connell
that
the
construction
proviso
is
based
on
the
close
community
of
interests
on
construction
sites.
that
close
community
of
interest
on
the
construction
site
justifies
the
limited
boycott
which
does
intrude
into
employee
and
employer
rights.
when
local
701's
members
are
employed
on
a
job
site,
they
are
a
part
of
that
close
community
of
interests
on
that
job
site,
but
they
are
not
part
of
the
close
community
of
interests
on
all
the
other
jobs
and
at
all
other
times
when
they
are
not
employed.
the
close
community
of
interests
on
the
particular
job
site
which
justifies
local
701's
intrusion
into
the
employee
and
the
employer
rights
with
respect
to
that
site
by
means
of
a
secondary
boycott
cannot
justify
the
intrusion
of
local
701
into
the
rights
of
employees
and
employers
on
other
job
sites
where
they
are
not
a
part,
where
the
union
and
local
701
are
not
a
part
of
the
close
community
of
interests.
this
subcontractor
clause
is
not
confined
to
those
occasions
where
local
701
is
a
part
of
the
close
community
of
interests,
and
therefore
it
is
not
within
the
purpose
of
the
proviso,
and
so
not
within
the
proviso.
there
can
be
no
doubt,
as
this
court
stated
in
connell,
that
a
major
aim
of
congress
in
1959
was
to
limit
top-down
organizing
by
economic
weapons,
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
subcontractor
clause
is
directly
contrary
to
that
major
aim.
it
top-down
organizes
by
virtue
of
an
economic
weapon,
namely,
the
secondary
boycott.
furthermore,
this
clause
cannot
be
justified
by
any
of
the
special
characteristics
of
the
construction
industry
which
congress
sought
to
accommodate
in
1959.
this
coercive
boycott
cannot
be
justified
by
the
purposes
underlying
section
8(f),
which
permits
voluntary
pre-hire
contracts
covering
the
contractor's
own
employees,
and
certainly
this
broad
clause
cannot
be
justified
by
congress's
purpose
of
avoiding
job
site
friction
between
union
and
non-union
workers
because
it
is
not
confined
to
those
occasions
where
such
friction
can
occur.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
well,
your
honor,
i
would
have
these
answers.
first
of
all,
both
premises,
i
suggest,
are
wrong.
first,
these
clauses
were
not
prevalent--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--well,
the
direct
answer
to
your
question
is
that--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--i
believe
the
general
counsel's
analysis
found
12
percent.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
the
issue
still,
your
honor,
is
to
determine
the
purpose
of
congress,
and
did
congress
intend
to
preserve,
if
you
will,
that
particular
kind
of
clause.
now,
it
is
true,
senator
kennedy
spoke
of
avoiding
serious
damage,
but
certainly
it
is
no
serious
damage
to
a
pattern
if
a
few
clauses
then
existed.
now,
it
is
true,
if
it
could
be
shown
that
virtually
every
contract
had
such
a
clause
in
the
construction
industry,
and
that
congress
did
indeed
intend
to
preserve
those
very
clauses,
certainly--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
no,
your
honor.
if
you
look
carefully
at...
the
principal
reliance
on
that
concept
which
is
argued
by
the
union
and
the
board
is
found
in
the
statements
of
senator
kennedy
in
connection
with
his
statements--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--he
was.
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
conference
committee
on
the
senate
side.
but
if
you
look
at
senator
kennedy's
own
statements
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
exception
was,
he
makes
it
very
clear
that
he
was
concerned
with
protecting
construction
unions
on
job
sites
from
substandard
wages
on
those
construction
sites.
we
give
the
specific
cites
to
that
in
our
brief,
and
you
will
see
from
his
statements
he
explicitly
indicates
that.
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
hope
to
cover
three
points
very
briefly.
first,
how
frequent
were
these
kind
of
clauses
in
1959?
there
are
just
two
studies
that
suggest
that.
first,
the
london
study,
which
was
not
made
for
this
purpose
and
which
the
general
counsel
found
inconclusive
because
it
does
not
distinguish
between
signatory
clauses
and
other
kinds
of
clauses.
secondly,
the
general
counsel's
own
study,
which
showed
that
only
12
percent
of
the
clauses
in
1959
included
signatory
clauses
of
any
kind.
i
must
flatly
disagree
with
the
statement
of
mr.
gold
in
response
to
the
court.
secondly--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--well,
your
honor,
of
course,
an
agreement
of
this
kind
was
not
required
until
after
the
act
was
passed,
so
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
it.
this
distinction,
growing
out
of
the
proviso,
only
came
about
after
the
proviso
was
enacted.
second,
with
respect
to
what
was
congress's
awareness
in
1959,
there
are
only
two
places
in
the
entire
congressional
record
that
suggest
an
awareness
of
this
particular
kind
of
a
clause,
and
on
both
of
those
occasions
it
was
explicitly
stated
that
it
was
intended
that
such
clauses
be
illegal,
and
i
refer
to
our
brief
on
that
point.
i
believe
it
is
our
reply
brief,
page
8.
thirdly,
with
respect
to
the
statements
of
senator
kennedy--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--they
were
both
before
the
proviso--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
on...
there
were
attempts
both
ways--
mr.
lewis
k.
scott
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
going
to
my
third
point,
which
i
believe
takes
up
the
point
you
are
making,
and
that
is,
with
respect
to
the
statements
of
senator
kennedy,
upon
which
they
rely,
first
of
all,
it
has
already
been
noted
by
the
court
that
argument
proves
too
much,
because
the
clause
in
connell
by
the
same
logic
would
have
been
unlawful
and
not
within
the
purpose
of
the
proviso.
secondly,
senator
kennedy's
statement
that
clauses
such
as
this
appear
to
be
legal
at
that
time
was
technically
accurate,
but
it
is
misleading.
the
only
law
at
that
time
on
this
point
of
any
significance
was
this
court's
sandor
case.
now,
this
court
in
sandor
did
indicate
that
a
secondary
employer
could
voluntarily
not
do
business
with
a
primary
employer,
and
yet
could
put
that
voluntarism
on
paper,
but
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
sandor
made
it
very
clear
that
the
union
could
not
force
that
contractor,
the
primary
or
the
primary
employer...
pardon
me,
the
secondary
employer
to
boycott
the
primary
employer,
nor
could
it
picket
the
secondary
employer
in
order
to
enforce
that
agreement,
nor
was
that
agreement
even
enforceable
in
court,
because,
according
to
the
language
and
the
logic
of
justice
frankfurter,
that
secondary
employer
at
the
time
he
made
his
decision
whether
to
boycott
or
not
boycott
the
primary
employer
had
to
be
unfettered
from
anything
contained
in
an
agreement
or
otherwise.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
senator
kennedy's
own
intentions,
i
submit
they
are
clear,
that
his
intention
was
not
to
legalize
this
kind
of
clause.
he
stated
that
the
reason
he
believed
a
proviso
was
necessary
to
the
hot
cargo
prohibitions
was,
it
seems
that
a
union
ought
to
be
able
to
ask
a
friendly
concern
to
stop
dealing
with
a
company
which
will
not
observe
fair
labor
standards,
and
that
is
senator
kennedy's
own
specific
statement
as
to
why
this
exception
was
needed.
that
is
at
two
legislative
history,
1708,
on
august
20,
1959.
thank
you.
