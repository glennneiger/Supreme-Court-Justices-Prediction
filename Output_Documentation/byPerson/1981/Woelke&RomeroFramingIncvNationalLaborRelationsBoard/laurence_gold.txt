mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
come
has
already
described
and
set
out
the
language
of
section
8(e)
and
the
language
of
the
proviso
thereto.
i
wish
to
begin
by
stressing
the
fact
that
the
proviso
is
not
one
stated
in
general
terms,
but
one
which
deals
specifically
with
the
contracting
and
subcontracting
of
work
at
a
job
site.
obviously,
the
very
language
shows
a
quite
particularized
intent
to
take
out
of
the
overall
prohibition
of
section
8(e)
a
particular
type
of
agreement.
moreover,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
we
believe
that
senator
kennedy's
statement
describing
the
proviso
deals
again
in
quite
specific
terms.
he
said,
in
part,
and
it
is
quoted
at
page
11
of
our
brief,
the
red
brief,
"agreements
by
which
a
contractor
in
the
construction
industry
promises
not
to
subcontract
work
on
a
construction
site
to
a
non-union
contractor
appear
to
be
legal
today.
"
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
union's
interests
are
dictated
by
the
nature
of
the
industry.
we
point
out,
and
the
passages
are
quoted
at
page
19
of
our
brief,
that
congress
at
the
same
time
it
was
considering
landrum-griffin,
whose
main
thrust
was
concerned
with
regulating
internal
union
affairs,
also
had
under
advisement
the
provision
which
became
section
8(f)
of
the
law,
and
which
deals
with
so-called
pre-hire
agreements.
and
in
their
study
of
the
industry,
they
noted
the
following
major
points.
one
is
that
the
occasional
nature
of
the
employment
relationship
makes
this
industry
markedly
different
from
manufacturing.
an
individual
employee
typically
works
for
many
employers.
moreover,
a
substantial
majority
of
the
skilled
employees
in
this
industry
constitute
a
pool
of
such
help
centered
about
their
appropriate
craft
union.
now,
in
terms
of
the
union's
interests,
it
is
slightly
different
on
behalf
of
those
employees
than
the
interest
of
an
industrial
union
dealing
with
a
particular
employer.
the
union
knows
that
the
employer
is
going
to
in
all
likelihood
during
the
term
of
the
contract
discontinue
particular
work
and
move
on
to
other
work.
what
the
union
is
concerned
about,
given
the
normal
pattern
of
this
industry
in
which
subcontracting
is
prevalent
is
that
the
organized
group
of
workers
who
are
really
attached
to
the
union
rather
than
to
any
particular
employer
continue
to
have
opportunities
to
do
the
work
that
the
union
is
negotiating
about.
if
not,
it
is
like
trying
to
hold
onto
quicksilver
without
putting
it
in
a
container,
because
of
the
capitalization
of
these
employers,
because
of
the
fact
that
work
begins
and
ends
frequently.
if
you
don't
preserve
the
work
in
general
terms
for
this
group
of
union
employees,
your
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
going
to
have
little
or
no
value
for
those
employees.
now,
to
be
sure,
one
answer
would
be
to
say
to
the
employer,
that
is
it,
no
more
subcontract.
given
this
industry,
that
just
hasn't
been
the
pattern.
rather,
the
union's
desire
has
been
to
make
sure
that
whether
that
already
organized
employer
does
the
work
or
not
or
whether
somebody
else
does
the
work,
its
members,
who
are
in...
coming
out
of
the
hiring
hall
along
with
other
people
who
may
want
to
go
through
the
hiring
hall,
get
the
work.
without
this
kind
of
clause,
unless
you
ban
subcontracting,
which
would
be
completely
against
the
whole
grain
and
pattern
of
the
way
the
industry
has
grown
up,
and
the
unions
just
haven't
had
an
interest
in
disrupting
that
pattern,
the
collective
agreement
becomes
of
little
or
no
worth.
that
is
why
unions
seek
this
kind
of
protection,
and
that
is
why,
incidentally,
as
the
very
language
at
least
of
the
opinion
in
connell
suggests,
it
is
rational
to
posit
a
difference
between
situations
in
which
the
agreement
is
part
of
a
collective
bargaining
arrangement
and
the
situation
in
connell
where
the
agreement
was
designably
outside
of
any
collective
bargaining
arrangement
in
the
hope
of
getting
through
a
hole
that
that
union
had
hoped
had
been
created
between
section
8(e)
and
section
8(b)(7),
which
banned
certain
kinds
of
organizational
picketing.
in
other
words,
in
this
situation,
the
union
is
seeking
to
advance
the
interests
of
those
who
have
already
made
a
free
choice,
a
choice
to
join
the
union
and
to
work
under
union
contracts.
it
cannot
do
it
in
an
effective
way
except
by
banning
subcontracting,
which
would
be
contrary
to
the
whole
tenor
of
the
industry--
mr.
laurence
gold
--no,
it
is
not,
because
in
this
instance--
mr.
laurence
gold
--there
is
a...
there
is
a...
there
is
an
interest
relating
to
a
primary
group
of
employees,
but
they
are
not
considered
primary
and
never
have
been
in
the
strict
labor
relation
terms
of
the
primary-secondary
dichotomy.
if
you,
for
example,
seek
an
agreement
concerning
subcontracting
of
a
kind
the
employees
have
not
done
in
the
past,
or
if
you
deal
with
work
being
done
by
other
unions,
that
is
secondary,
in
the
strict
legal
terms.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
that's
correct,
and
given
the
craft
nature
of
the
unions
here,
they
have
a
very
great
interest
in
that.
the
structure
of
the...
the
structure
of
bargaining
here
reflects
the
division
of
the
industry
into
general
and
subcontractors.
the
division
of
the
labor
side
of
the
industry
into
various
craft
units
and
the
overall
fact
that
because
of
the
structure
on
the
employer
side
and
because
of
the
nature
of
construction
you
have
hundreds
of
jobs
starting
and
beginning
all
the
time,
and
you
have
a
practice
whereby
an
individual
who
gets
the
work
on
the
employer
side
may
or
may
not
keep
it.
he
is
less
likely
to
keep
it
than
not.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
depends.
the
answer
is
that
there
are
such
unions.
the
operating
engineers
and
the
carpenters,
the
two
unions
that
are
involved
here,
are
most
likely
to
do
that,
because
general
contractors
as
the
woelke
case
shows...
woelke
is
a
sub
who
does
specialty
framing
work.
general
contractors
use
carpenters,
or
they
may
decide
to
use
subcontractors.
general
contractors,
as
the
argument
on
the
other
side
indicates,
may
do
certain
kinds
of
heavy
machinery
operations
themselves,
and
may
decide
not
to
do
work
of
that
kind.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
laborers,
electricians,
a
variety
of
these
crafts
can
work
either
for
general
or
subs.
also,
when
you
get
down
to
the
sub
level,
woelke
can
give
away
part
of
the
work
it
has,
and
may
well
do
so,
depending
on
how
onerous
it
finds
its
collective
agreement,
how
loosely
the
agreement
binds
it,
and
so
on.
so
you
have
general
subs,
sub
subs,
subs
under
that.
this
is
a
very
complicated
series
of
interlocking
relationships,
and
when
you
look
at
the
debate
concerning
the
denver
building
case,
which
was
certainly
one
element
of
the
consideration
in
1959,
congress
was
well
aware
that
you
had
these
complex
relationships
leading
to
the
construction
of
a
single
overall
piece
of
construction,
whether
it
be
a
building,
a
factory,
a
highway,
and
that
there
was
an
interrelation
between
these
different
generals
and
subs
or
people
who
were
primary
and
secondary
contractors,
whatever
you
are
going
to
call
them.
and
part
of
the
disquiet
about
the
denver
building
case,
and
certainly
a
major
drive
was
not
simply
union
and
non-union
people
don't
work
very
well
on
a
single
job
together,
but
also
with
this
very
problem
that
we
are
discussing,
that
if
you
organize
a
general
contractor,
or
you
organize
a
subcontractor,
given
the
prevalence
of
contracting
out
in
this
industry,
and
given
the
nature
of
these
companies,
which
form,
reform,
create
joint
ventures,
and
so
on,
the
unions
on
the
other
side
may
well
have
nothing
other
than
a
piece
of
paper
when
they
are
all
done.
mr.
laurence
gold
you
can
organize
a
subcontractor--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes,
but
the
problem
is
that
the
subcontractor
can
do
precisely
the
same
thing,
justice
white.
you
may
have
him
organized,
and
then
he
and
a
few
other
people
create
a
new
sub.
you
don't
necessarily
have
him
organize
unless
you
have
this
kind
of
clause,
and
that
is
why
they
are
signed.
it
is
because
of
the
protean
nature
both
of
the
types
of
arrangements
which
employers
make
between
themselves
and
because
of
the
equally
various
ways
that
employers
choose
to
organize
their
business
that
you
have
great
problems
from
the
union
side
in
organizing
the
industry.
it
is
in
that
way
this
industry
is
very
similar
to
the
garment
industry,
which
was
the
only
other
one
which
received
any
exemption
from
section
8(e).
it
is
the
same
variety
of
business
arrangements
which
make
it
very
difficult
to
maintain
the
situation
of
the
already
organized
people
who
are
a
group
of
people
basically
in
competition
with
other
people
working...
looking
for
the
same
work.
the
top-down
organizing
situation
which
is
described
is
quite
likely
to
be
a
misnomer.
what
you
really
have
are
ten
people
and
five
jobs.
five
of
them
are
organized,
and
five
of
them
are
unorganized.
and
the
question
is,
by
getting
an
agreement
with
somebody,
can
you
hold
onto
those
five
jobs
or
are
you
going
to
find
out
that
all
you
have
is
the
promise
of
those
jobs,
but
as
soon
as
the
construction
starts
you
find
out
that
somebody
else
is
the
employer,
and
those
five
unorganized
people
are
doing
the
work.
now,
congress
could
say
that
you
cannot
use
this
tool
to
maintain
your
situation.
our
point
of...
our
point
in
this
argument
is
that
congress
did
not
say
so.
the
language
does
not
say
so.
the
explanations
do
not
say
so.
and
the
explanations
in
this
instance
are
authoritative
and
specific,
as
i
started
to
say
in
responding
to
justice
white's
question.
congress
focused
on
the
contracting
and
subcontracting
on
the
site.
it
did
so
in
a
way
which
preserves
the
right
to
enter
into
subcontracting
agreements.
it
did
so
against
a
background,
to
take
up
a
point
again
that
mr.
come
made,
where
one
bargaining
structure
that
was
prevalent,
and
as
the
london
study
showed,
probably
the
most
prevalent
type
of
structure,
was
to
require
that
subcontractors
assume
agreements
when
they
take
a
subcontract,
and
no
one
has
ever
found
the
kind
of
contract
that
the
petitioners
say
is
the
only
kind
that
is
legal,
an
agreement
confined
to
a
particular
job
site
where
there
are
both
union
and
non-union
people.
never
in
the
history
of
collective
bargaining...
they
have
all
sorts
of
resources,
and
they
have
been
busy
looking.
nobody
ever
signed
that
kind
of
agreement.
it
would
be
impossible,
and
i
think
we
are
in
a
better
position
to
say
this
than
what
they
are
trying
to
foist
on
us,
it
would
be
impossible
in
our
view
to
effectively
police
and
enforce
such
an
agreement.
it
would
do
nothing
concerning
the
fact
that
the
people
who
are
covered,
the
organized
pool
of
workers,
might
lose
the
work.
all
you
have
to
do
is
not
give
the
work
to
the
already
organized
people,
and
then
the
whole
clause
disappears
on
you.
what
was
present
at
the
time,
what
the
house,
having
been
advised,
sought
to
outlaw,
and
what
the
senate
said
it
would
not
accept
the
outlawing
of
was
this
type
of
subcontracting
agreement.
we
are
not
here
to
quarrel
in
any
way
with
the
connell
case
that,
taking
everything
into
account,
agreements
which
are
entered
into
outside
of
a
collective
relationship,
where
you
don't
have
the
interests
which
i
have
outlined,
were
not
intended
to
be
covered.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
even
though
congress
was
quite
specific,
it
didn't
intend
to
legitimize
something
which
had
never
been
seen
before,
but
it
is
another
thing
to
say
that
it
intended,
even
though
it
used
words
which
state
the
contrary,
and
even
though
the
authoritative
explanation
is
to
the
contrary,
to
outlaw
this
type
of
clause.
mr.
laurence
gold
when
you
look
at
those
contracts,
what
it
shows
is
that
the
subcontractor
had
to
take
the
whole
clause,
including
the
recognition
clause,
where
it
is
legal,
the
union
security
clause,
the
union
hiring
hall
referral
clause,
and
so
on.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
not...
i
would
be
unfair
if
i
said
almost
the
only
one.
it
was
the
most
prevalent
that
the
sole
scientific
study
found.
it
was
the
kind
that
was
complained
of
to
the
house.
the
one
thing
that
is
for
sure
is
that
nobody
ever
saw
what
the
petitioners
claim
is
the
sole
thing
that
congress
intended
to
preserve,
and
it
is
only
coincidental
that
their
construct
of
what
congress
intended
to
preserve
doesn't
meet
the
interests
of
the
organized
employees
on
the
other
side,
and
is
probably
unenforceable.
that
just
happens
to
be
where
their
construct
comes
out.
so,
the
way
i
would
conclude
is
that
there
are
situations
in
which
the
language
points
one
way
and
the
explanations,
either
in
terms
of
stating
the
nature
of
the
problem
or
in
terms
of
explaining
what
the
language,
the
statutory
language
means,
point
in
opposite
directions.
here,
while
there
isn't
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history,
on
this
particular
point,
it
is
very,
very
precise.
congress
doesn't
have
to
be
long-winded
about
it.
this
happened
in
the
conference.
the
senate
insisted
on
its
position.
senator
kennedy
explained
its
position.
that
is
the
sole
authoritative
statement.
nobody
said
to
senator
kennedy,
wait
a
minute,
that
isn't
what
this
means.
nobody
disputed
what
he
said,
and
what
he
said
is
that
agreements
of
this
type
are
entirely
lawful.
and
that
is
perfectly
consistent--
mr.
laurence
gold
--thank
you.
