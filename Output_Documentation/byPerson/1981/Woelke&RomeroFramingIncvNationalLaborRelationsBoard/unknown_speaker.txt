unknown

mr.
prager,
before
you
get
to
that,
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
dispute
the
suggestion
by
your
adversaries
that
this
type
of
clause
was
prevalent
in
the
construction
industry
prior
to
1959?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
must
convince
us
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
act
is
just
contrary
to
congressional
intent.
unknown
speaker
it
must
be,
then,
your
position
must
be
that
there
is
just
no
room
in
the
statute
for
the
board's
construction.
unknown
speaker
two
choices
are
not
available.
there
is
only
one.
there
are
not
two
ways
to
construe
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
take
that
position.
you
have
to
take
that
position,
that
there
is
only
one
way.
if
there
were
two
ways,
i
suppose
you
would
have
a
problem
about
whether
we
should
defer
to
the
choice
between
two
reasonable
constructions.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
prager,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
would
appear
to
be
in
favor
of
the
respondent's
position,
would
it
not?
you
have
to
ask
us
to
look
behind
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
to
reach
your
position.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
we
left
the
question
open
in
the
connell
decision,
and
we
now
have
to
resolve
it.
before
you
finish,
would
you
address
yourself
briefly
to
the
second
issue?
there
is
a
concern
about
whether
that
issue
was
sufficiently
raised
at
the
board
level
for
us
to
address
it.
unknown
speaker
was
it
more
than
merely
mentioned,
or
was
it
specifically
raised?
unknown
speaker
but
our
cases,
our
cases
generally
have
required
that
the
issue
be
expressly
raised
before
the
board,
haven't
they?
unknown
speaker
although
arguably
within
the
language.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
general
contractor
in
your
example
had
the
two
plumbers
on
some
job,
you
would
think
the
clause
would
be
enforceable
at
that
job?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
saying
it
is
invalid
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
just
as
applied
to
jobs
where
the
contractor
didn't
have
union
members
working.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
if
we
agreed
with
you
but
except
to
say
that,
well,
this
clause
is
invalid
insofar
as,
but
valid
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
just
a
nicety.
that
is
preserving
the
clause
where
it
is
legally
applied
and
striking
it
down
where
it
isn't.
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
scott,
you
rely
rather
heavily
on
the
connell
case.
what
difference
does
it
make,
if
any,
that
that
came
up
in
an
antitrust
context
without
any
interpretation
by
the
board?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
board's
view
presented
in
connell?
it
was,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
an
amicus
brief?
unknown
speaker
by
general
moore?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
scott--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
you
found
that
in
1959,
in
the
construction
industry,
this
kind
of
subcontractor
clause
was
very
prevalent,
was
practically
in
every
contract
that
was
signed,
and
then
you
find
that
congress
exempts
the
construction
industry
in
a
provision
from
8(e).
what
would
you
think
then?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that,
but
what
about
my
question?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
an
argument
that
they
were
certainly
not
rare
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
intended
to
preserve
something,
didn't
they,
that
otherwise
might
have
been
eliminated
by
8(e)?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
just
intended
generally
to
preserve
the
status
quo
in
the
construction
industry?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
heavily
involved
in
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
evidence
in
any
of
those
statements
that
they
are
talking
expressly
or
particularly
about
this
particular
kind
of
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
don't
have
any
where
they
mention
this
particular
kind
of
an
agreement?
unknown
speaker
and
so
what
is
your
point,
mr.
come?
so
that
was
in
the
hearings.
then
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
there
was
a
clause
like
that
in
existence.
there
might
have
been
a
lot
of
them.
so
then
what?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
except
for
the
proviso,
the
construction
industry
proviso,
8(e)
would
have
banned
these,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
the
question
is,
why
did
they
make
the
exception?
unknown
speaker
and
how
broadly
did
they
want
to
make
the
exception?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
argument
would
certainly
indicate
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
its
view
of
this
legislative
history
in
connell.
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
board
construe
this
proviso
before
connell?
did
it
ever?
unknown
speaker
so
the
board's
construction
of
the
act
was
rejected
in
connell.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
board's
construction
of
the
act
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
a
contract
involved
in
connell
was
rejected.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
you
did
have
a
position
on
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
the
board
itself
had
never
taken
a
position.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
how
frequently
were
clauses
of
the
kind
involved
in
this
case
utilized
in
the
industry
prior
to
1959?
unknown
speaker
but
he
didn't
have
to
be
unionized
in
that
provision.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
a--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
is
your
answer,
then--
unknown
speaker
--in
50
instances
out
of
1,000?
i
didn't
understand
the
response,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
can
be
properly
characterized
as
a
pattern,
50
out
of
1,000?
unknown
speaker
you
referred
to
a
d.c.
circuit
case.
you
didn't
mention
the
name
of
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
i
just--
unknown
speaker
--very
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gold,
suppose
the
union
and
the
employer
are
negotiating
their
contract,
and
the
union
wants
one
of
these
provisions.
now,
do
you
suppose
if...
what
interest
would
the
union
have
in
telling
the
employer,
and
by
the
way,
we
expect
this
clause
to
apply
to
any
site
even
though
none
of
our
members
are
on
that
site?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
your
suggestion
then
that
it
is
just
a...
you
didn't
even
need
the
proviso?
unknown
speaker
that
sounds
like
a
primary--
unknown
speaker
--well,
this
would
certainly...
this
kind
of
a
clause,
if
it
were
in
force,
would
certainly
keep
the
employer
from
subcontracting
to
a
subcontractor
who
is
organized
by
some
other
union.
unknown
speaker
are
there
a
fair
number
of
unions
who
supply
laborers
both
to
general
contractors
and
to
subcontractors?
unknown
speaker
well,
unless
they
have
a
few
subcontractors
organized.
unknown
speaker
there
are
major
subcontractors
in
almost
every
market.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
language
in
the
footnote
on
page
15
of
the
government's
brief,
"and
although
the
terms
of
these
provisions
vary,
the
most
common
required
contractors
to
agree
to
subcontract
work
only
to
subcontractors
who
would
apply
all
the
"terms
and
conditions"
of
the
master
agreement?
"
unknown
speaker
would
he
have
to
sign
an
agreement,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
to
sign
the--
unknown
speaker
--sign
the
agreement.
well,
so
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
by
far
the
most
common
kind
of
subcontractor
clause,
or
practically
the
only
kind
is
the
kind
that
would
cover
this
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
also
disagree
with
what
he
said
that
no
one
has
ever
found
an
agreement
that
on
its
face
is
the
kind
that
you
suggest
would
be
legal?
unknown
speaker
was
that
before
or
after
the
proviso
was
put
into
the
hopper,
the
statement
that
it
should
be
illegal?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
there
was
general
prohibition
of
all
this
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
at
that
time,
there
was
an
intent
to
prohibit
all
this
sort
of
thing
without
focusing
on
the
construction
industry.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
making
them
illegal
was
part
of
making
all
hot
cargo
clauses
and
the
like
illegal.
