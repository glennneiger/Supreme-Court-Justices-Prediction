mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
section
8(e),
which
was
added
to
the
act
in
1959,
outlaws
so-called
hot
cargo
or
secondary
boycott
agreements.
the
construction
industry
to
section
8(e)
states,
however,
that
nothing
in
this
subsection
(e)
shall
apply
to
an
agreement
between
a
labor
organization
and
an
employer
in
the
construction
industry
relating
to
the
contracting
or
subcontracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
construction.
now,
as
has
been
pointed
out
previously,
read
literally,
the
proviso's
exemption
for
secondary
subcontracting
agreements
plainly
encompasses
the
agreements
here
since
they
relate
to
the
contracting
of
construction
site
work.
normally,
that
should
end
the
matter.
however,
in
connell,
this
court
indicated
that
the
proviso
may
not
be
applied
literally
where
to
do
so
would
be
to
frustrate
congress's
purpose.
therefore,
let
us
turn
to
the
legislative
history
and
see
that
far
from
frustrating
congress's
purpose,
to
interpret
the
proviso
as
the
board
has
done
here
as
privileging
the
type
of
subcontracting
clauses
that
we
have
here
when
entered
into
in
the
collective
bargaining
relationship,
effectuates
rather
than
frustrates
congress's
purpose.
the
court
may
recall
that
section
8(b)(4)(a)
of
the
1947
act
outlawed
strike
pressure
against
a
neutral
employer
to
force
him
to
cease
doing
business
with
an
employer
with
whom
the
union
had
a
primary
dispute.
this
left
certain
loopholes
in
the
act's
regulation
of
secondary
boycotts,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
sandor,
that
although
it
was
no
defense
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
under
8(b)(4)(a)
that
the
struck
employer
had
agreed
in
advance
to
boycott
a
disfavored
product,
the
mere
execution
of
such
a
contract
or
its
voluntary
observance
by
the
employer
did
not
violate
section
8(b)(4)(a).
this
was
regarded
as
a
loophole,
and
the
landrum-griffin
bill,
which
passed
the
house,
plugged
this
loophole
completely.
it
added
a
new
provision
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
main
body
of
the
current
section
8(e)
that
made
it
unlawful
for
any
labor
organization
and
any
employer
to
enter
into
an
agreement
whereby
the
employer
agreed
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
moreover,
section
8(b)(4)(a)
was
amended
also
to
prescribe
strike
pressure,
to
force
an
employer
to
agree
to
such
a
boycott
agreement
because,
as
representative
griffin
explained
in
a
passage
that
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
although
under
existing
law
it
was
unlawful
to
strike
to
force
a
secondary
employer
to
cease
handling
certain
products
or
to
cease
doing
business
with
some
other
person,
the
law,
and
i
am
quoting,
"does
not
prohibit
the
same
kind
of
activity
to
force
such
employers
to
sign
contracts
or
agreements
not
to
handle
or
transport
goods
coming
from
a
source
characterized
by
the
union
as
unfair.
"
and
indeed,
in
sandor,
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
court
held
that
the
agreement
was
no
defense
to
strike
pressure
to
enforce
the
agreement
was
that
the
agreement
itself
might
have
been
the
result
of
strike
pressure.
so,
these
two
loopholes,
pressure
to
get
an
agreement
and
the
agreement
itself,
were
sought
to
be
plugged
in
the
landrum-griffin
bill.
now,
there
is
little
doubt
that
had
the
landrum-griffin
bill
been
enacted
it
would
have
interdicted
the
clauses
that
we
have
here
as
well
as
strike
pressure
to
get
those
clauses.
when
the
house
and
senate
bills
were
referred
to
the
conference
committee,
and
incidentally,
the
senate
bill
only
banned
hot
cargo
agreements
in
the
trucking
industry,
the
senate
conferees,
led
by
senator
kennedy,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
conference
committee,
insisted
on
exemptions
from
the
ban
on
secondary
agreements
for
the
garment
industry
and
for
agreements
relating
to
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
a
construction
project.
the
conference
agreed
to
these
changes.
senator
kennedy,
in
his
contemporaneous
report
to
the
senate
on
the
result
of
the
conference,
pointed
out
that
the
qualification
for
construction
site
subcontracting
agreements,
like
the
garment
industry
proviso,
was
necessary
to
avoid
serious
damage
to
the
pattern
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
industry,
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
construction
industry
proviso
is
intended
to
preserve
the
state
of
the
law
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
agreements
relating
to
the
contracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
the
construction
project.
agreements
by
which
a
contractor
in
the
construction
industry
promises
not
to
subcontract
work
on
a
construction
site
to
a
non-union
contractor
appear
to
be
legal
today.
they
will
not
be
unlawful
under
section
8(e).
and
this
is
not
the
only
reference
to
an
intent
by
the
construction
industry
proviso
to
preserve
the
status
quo
in
the
industry.
you
find
exactly
the
same
statement
in
the
house
conference
report.
they
don't
talk
about
the
pattern
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
industry,
but
they
do
make
the
point
that
these
agreements
in
the
construction
industry
appear
to
be
lawful
today,
and
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
is
to
preserve
that
status
quo.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
so.
however,
there
is--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--there
is--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--we
do
not
have
it
in
this
statement.
however,
there
is
very
clear
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
agreements...
that
congress
was
aware
of
such
agreements,
and
was
indeed
asked
to
outlaw
them.
the
clearest
evidence
of
that,
which
is
set
out
on
pages
16
and
17
of
the
board's
brief,
is
the
hearings
before
the
house
labor
committee,
which
was
presided
over
by
representative
landrum,
in
which
you
had
representatives
of
an
independent
union
and
of
a
contractor
in
the
construction
industry
complaining
that
under
existing
laws,
employers
and
unions
could
lawfully
enter
into
union
signatory
subcontracting
clauses,
and
that
because
of
these
agreements,
employers
whose
employees
had
selected
another
union
were
denied
any
opportunity
to
compete
for
construction
jobs.
the
specific
contract
which
was
called
to
the
court's
attention
was
the
one
involved
in
the
musser
case
before
the
board
and
the
d.
c.
court
of
appeals.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
in
the
hearings
as
a
result
of
pointing
out,
and
the
clause
involved
was
essentially
similar
to
the
one
that
we
have
here.
it
was
described
as
a
clause--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--what
happened
then
was
that
representatives
landrum
and
griffin
came
up
with
a
proposal
that
would
have
outlawed
these
clauses.
it
would
have
outlawed
all
forms
of
secondary
agreements,
including
these
clauses.
it
went
to
the
conference
committee,
and
the
senate
conferees
would
not
buy
it,
because
they
felt
that
it
would--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes,
it
would
have.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
made
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
they
said
that
they
made
the
exception
to
preserve
the
pattern
of
bargaining
in
the
construction
industry,
and
to
maintain
the
status
quo
in
that
industry,
and
as
is
evidenced
by
the
musser
case
plus
the
london
study,
subcontracting
clauses
of
this
type
were
part
of
the
pattern
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
construction
industry.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
your
honor,
the
court
did
not
finally
resolve
its
view
as
to
the
legislative
history--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--before
connell,
the
board
had...
had
not
construed
it
in
a
manner
differently.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
general
counsel,
believing
that
even
the
clause
in
connell
was
protected
by
the
construction
industry
proviso,
did
not
issue
a
complaint
in
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
your
honor,
it
was...
it
was
not
in--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct.
the
board
did
not
take
a
position
on
that
in
this
court
in
connell,
although
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--the
board
had
never
addressed
it
in
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
you
had
in
connell.
the
difference
between
connell
and
this
case
is
that
there,
the
union
sought
a
bare
subcontracting
clause--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--outside
of
a
collective
bargaining
relationship.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
not
the
conventional
type
of
situation.
the
general
counsel
in
refusing
to
issue
a
complaint
with
respect
to
that
sort
of
a
clause
thought
that
it
would
be
governed
by
the
same
sort
of
history
and
interpretation
that
would
govern
the
conventional
situation--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--the
board
had
never
had
occasion
to
take
a
position,
because
the
general
counsel
had
never
issued
a
complaint
on
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
the
board
pointed
that
out
to
this
court
in
connell.
it
also
said
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
this
was
covered
by
8(e)
or
not
because
in
the
board's
view,
even
if
it
were
violative
of
8(e),
it
didn't
follow
that
antitrust
sanctions--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--could
be
applied,
that
the
remedies
under
the
labor
act
were
the
sole
remedies.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
know
if
i
can
give
a
statistical
count.
the
london
study
notes,
after
studying
over
1,000
some
odd
contracts
with
subcontracting
clauses
that
the
single
most
frequent
requirement
found
in
more
than
50
major
contracts
called
for
the
subcontractor
to
comply
with
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
prime
employer's
agreement.
so--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--oh,
yes--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
the
terms
of
these
contracts
require
you
to
recognize
the
union,
to
draw
your
manpower
from
the
union's
hiring
hall,
and
so
on.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
some
of
them
even
specifically
require
you
to
sign
the
union
contract.
now,
the...
the
difference
between
connell
and
this
case
was--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
studied,
i
believe
it
was
about
1,000
contracts.
not
all
of
them
were
limited
to
the...
oh,
in
the
footnote
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
we
state
that
of
the
more
than
700,000
construction
workers
working
under
155
construction
contracts
examined
in
the
london
study,
there
were
50...
50
of
these
contracts
had
subcontracting
clauses
of
this
type.
i
got
the
bigger
figure
because
that
study
also
dealt
with
subcontracting
clauses
in
other
industries.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
50,
i
said,
out
of
155.
i
think
that
it
certainly
shows
that
it
was
part
of
the
pattern,
and
the
musser
case,
which
was
specifically
called
to
congress's
attention,
was
clearly
a
clause
of
this
type,
and
indeed,
the
committee
was
advised
that
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
had
just
held
that
there
was
nothing
unlawful
about
such
a
clause
under
the
1947
labor
act,
so
this
is
not
something
that
you
can
say
congress
was
completely
unaware
of
or
that
it
is
a
new
kind
of
tactic
such
as
you
had
in
connell,
where
the
union
in
an
effort
to
get
away
from
the
regulation
that
8(b)(7)
imposed
on
organizational
picketing
structured
its
activity
so
that
they
were
seeking
a
subcontracting
clause
without
undertaking
to
represent
any
of
the
contractors'
employees.
that
is
totally
different
from
the
typical
situation
which
we
have
in
this
case,
where
the
union
in
seeking
a
subcontracting
clause
is
seeking
it
as
part
of
a
completed
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
governs
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
of
the
contractor's
employees,
and
it
is
because
of
the
vital
interest
that
this
subcontracting
clause
has
given
the
short
term
duration
of
jobs
in
the
construction
industry
and
the
floating
pool
of
workers
that
the
unions
of
a
particular
contractor
requires
clauses
of
this
sort
in
order
to
assure
a
continuity
in
their
negotiated
contract
benefits.
and
this
is
what
congress
was
concerned
about
in
enacting
the
proviso
to
section
8(e).

your
