mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act
of
a
suit
to
recover
on
a
claim
for
benefits
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i
think
the
questions
of...
the
question
of
judicial
review
and
administrative
review
by
the
secretary
are
two
quite
different
questions.
the
structure
and
the
administration
of
the
part
b
program
were
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
previous
argument,
and
i
will
not
go
through
all
of
that
now.
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
summarize
at
the
outset.
as
mr.
geller
pointed
out
this
morning,
the
medicare
program
is
divided
into
two
parts.
part
a
provides--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
guess
that
would
depend
on
the...
on
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
guess
that
would
depend
on
the...
on
the
scope
that
the
court
found
of
the
court
of
claims
review.
as
mr.
sohnen
pointed
out
this
morning,
if
the
question
of
bias
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
facts
might
be
found
in
a
particular
way,
it
is
unclear
under
the
court
of
claims
decision
in
this
case
how
closely
it
would
look
into
the
facts
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
yes.
under...
under
the
part
b
program,
the
individual
beneficiary
can
either
submit
his
claim
himself
or
he
can
assign
it
to
the
doctor
or
other
person
who
furnished
the
services,
but
the
procedural
rights
of
the
two
are
the
same.
the
act
and
the
implementing
regulations
make
clear
that
the
doctor
or
other
furnishers'
procedural
rights
derive
entirely
from
those
of
the
beneficiary,
and
in
fact
the
act
provides
that
when
the
doctor
is
paid
on
a
particular
claim,
that
the
claim
is
really
on
behalf
of
the
beneficiary.
so,
for
purposes
of
judicial
review,
as
for
purposes
of
the
administrative
review
involved
in
the
earlier
case,
the
rights
are
the
same.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
i
mentioned,
the
part
a
program
provides
insurance
for
hospital
and
related
post-hospital
services.
part
b,
involved
in
this
case,
provides
insurance
for
doctor
services,
medical
supplies,
ex-rays,
laboratory
tests.
under
part
b,
80
percent
of
the
reasonable
charge
for
these
services
is
paid
by
medicare.
as
the
court
of
claims
described
it
in
this
case,
the
medicare
part
b
program
is
vast
and
complex.
there
are
many
millions
of
claims
submitted
annually
by
or
on
behalf
of
27
million
beneficiaries,
and
largely
for...
because
of
the
scope
of
the
program,
congress
provided
that
the
claims
would
be
administered
by
private
insurance
carriers.
now,
as
i
mentioned,
claims
can
be
submitted
when
a
person
finds
or
believes
that
he
has
received
services
that
are
covered
by
the
act,
the
claim
can
be
submitted
either
on
his
own
behalf
or
by
the
physician,
but
as
i
mentioned,
this
has
no
effect
on
the
jurisdictional
question
in
this
case,
but
when
the
claim
is
first
submitted
to
the
carrier,
if
the
claimant,
either
the
beneficiary
or
the
assignee,
is
dissatisfied
with
the
carrier's
determination
of
the
amount,
if
any,
that
should
be
paid
on
that
particular
claim,
he
can
seek
the
fair
hearing
by
the
carrier
that
was
discussed
in
the
previous
case.
however,
the
act
does
not
provide
for
judicial
review
of
that
benefit
amount
determination.
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
scheme
under
part
a,
the
hospital
insurance
program.
under
part
a,
congress
has
expressly
provided
for
a
right
of
judicial
review
when
a
request
for
payment
for
hospital
services
is
denied,
and
in
that
case
the
review
is
not
in
the
court
of
claims,
as
the
court
of
claims
held
in
this
case,
but
it
is
pursuant
to
section
405(g)
of
title
42,
which
is
the
standard
judicial
review
provision
of
the
social
security
act.
this
provision
is
consistent
with
the
fact
that
the
medicare
act,
which
is
simply
title
18
of
the
social
security
act,
and
congress
incorporated
the
standard
judicial
review
procedure
under
part
a
for
those
purposes.
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
a
distributor
of
medical
supplies
used
by
patients
who
are
undergoing
kidney
maintenance
dialysis
in
their
homes.
many
of
these
patients,
customers
of
respondent,
are
beneficiaries
under
the
part
b
medicare
program.
respondent
would
mail
the
medical
supplies,
often
in
the
forms
of
kits
containing
all
the
necessary
supplies
for
home
dialysis,
to
patients
around
the
country,
and
when
the
patients
were
enrolled
under
part
b,
they
would
in
return
assign
their
right
to
be
reimbursed
for
80
percent
of
the
reasonable
charge
for
these
supplies
back
to
respondent.
respondent
would
then
collect
these
assigned
claims
and
submit
them
to
the
prudential
insurance
company,
which
is
the
carrier
designated
for
the
processing
of
the
claims
received
by
respondent.
the
period
involved
in
this
case
in
particular
is
the
years...
are
the
years
1974
through
1976.
respondent
became
dissatisfied
over
a
period
of
time
with
the
amount
that
it
was
receiving
in
reimbursement
for
the
supplies
that
were
furnished
to
the
patients,
and
respondent
requested
that
prudential
recalculate
the
reasonable
charge
on
which
the
reimbursement
would
be
made,
and
requested
that
this
be
done
both
retroactively
for
charges
that
had
already
been
paid
and
prospectively
for
the
remainder
of
the
particular
fiscal
year.
prudential
did
choose
to
make
a
prospective
adjustment
for
one
particular
product
because
of
exceptional
circumstances
affecting
the
price
of
that
product,
but
for
other
items,
the
carrier
declined
to
make
an
adjustment,
principally
because
of
a
provision
in
the
act
which
limits
the
amount
of
reimbursement
to
the
prevailing
for
the
particular
service
in
the
locality
during
the
preceding
calendar
year,
so
the
act
has
a
built-in
limit
or
ceiling
on
the
amount
that
can
be...
that
can
be
paid
out.
prudential's
determinations
in
this
regard
were
sustained
after
the
fair
hearing
by
the
carrier,
and
respondent
then
brought
this
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
again,
respondent
alleged
that
the
amount
that
prudential
had
paid
on
its
assigned
claims
was
insufficient,
and
it
sought
to
recover
from
the
united
states
a
money
judgment
equivalent
to
the
amount
of
these
alleged
underpayments.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
of
whether
the
particular
supplies
were
covered
by
part
b.
this
is
simply
a
question
of
the
amount
that
would
be
paid
for
those
services.
the
united
states
argued
in
the
court
of
claims
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction,
because
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
medicare
act
demonstrated
that
congress
intended
to
foreclose
judicial
review
of
individual
benefit
determinations
under
part
b.
the
government
also
argued
that
section
405
(h)
of
the...
of
title
42
as
incorporated
into
the
medicare
act
precluded
judicial
review
of
these
claims.
the
court
of
claims,
however,
rejected
these
arguments.
in
that's...
in
that
court's
view,
judicial
review
must
be
available
in
the
court
of
claims
of
medicare
claims
pursuant
to
the
tucker
act
absent
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
the
congressional
intent
to
bar
judicial
review
in
a
tucker
act
suit.
the
court
acknowledged
that
congress
had
expressly
provided
for
judicial
review
under
part
a,
but
not
under
part
b,
but
the
court
declined
to
view
this
omission
as
a
foreclosure
of
judicial
review.
in
the
court
of
claims'
analysis,
the
express
provision
for
judicial
review
under
part
a
simply
demonstrated
that
congress
wanted
those
particular
provisions
followed,
but
in
other
cases,
such
as
in
part
b,
where
congress
declined
to
provide
for
judicial
review,
that
review
would
be
available
under
what
the
court
of
claims
termed
general
jurisdictional
provisions,
such
as
the
tucker
act.
the
court
also
rejected
the
argument
based
on
section
405(h)
of
the
social
security
act,
observing
that
it
had
previously
declined
to
extend
this
court's
decision
in
weinberger
versus
salfi,
concerning
the
meaning
of
405(h)
to
medicare
cases
in
the
court
of
claims.
on
the
merits,
the
court
of
claims
remanded
to
prudential
for
a
recomputation
of
the
prevailing
charge
level
in
the
preceding
years,
and
also
remanded
for
prudential
to
reconsider
whether
to
grant
a
retroactive
adjustment
for
the
cost
of
the
particular
product
that
prudential
had
granted
a
prospective
adjustment
in
the
reasonable
charge
for.
the
court
of
claims
rejected
as
insubstantial
respondent's
constitutional
challenge
to
the...
to
the
means
of
reimbursing
it
subject
to
a
ceiling
based
on
the
previous
year's
prevailing
charge
limitations.
the
united
state
petitioned
for
certiorari
in
this
court
only
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
neither
party
has
requested
the
court
to
review
the
merits
of
the
court
of
claims
decision.
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
that
the
jurisdictional
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
is
inconsistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
concerning
the
scope
of
the
court
of
claims'
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act.
the
decision
below
is
also
directly
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
medicare
act
itself,
and
to
the
clearly
expressed
congressional
intent,
both
when
the
medicare
act
was
enacted
in
1965
and
when
it
was
amended
in
1972,
to
bar
judicial
review
of
individual
reimbursement
disputes
on
medicare
claims
in
order
to
avoid
deluging
the
courts
with
these
sorts
of
claims.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
in
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
the
first...
the
first
ground
concerns
the
established
principles
governing
tucker
act
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
as...
as
to
that
we
submit
that
the
court
of
claims
was
plainly
wrong
in
concluding
that
judicial
review
in
the
form
of
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act
must
be
presumed
to
exist
in
the
court
of
claims
absent
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
the
rule
is
precisely
opposite,
as
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
testan
and
mitchell
make
clear.
in
those
cases,
the
court
has
reiterated
the
established
rule
that
the
united
states
as
the
sovereign
is
immune
from
suit,
except
as
congress
consents
to
suit,
and
that
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
consent
to
suit
cannot
be
implied
but
must
be
unequivocally
expressed.
the
tucker
act,
to
which
the
court
of
claims
referred,
is
simply
a
jurisdictional
statute.
it
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
claims
to
consider
individuals'
suits
only
when
some
other
statute
confers
a
right
to
recover
a
money
judgment
against
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
waive
sovereign
immunity.
thus,
in
this
case,
respondent
had...
had
a
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states,
and
the
court
of
claims
therefore
had
jurisdiction
only
if
the
medicare
act
contains
the
necessary
unequivocally
expressed
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
a
grant
or...
or
put
another
way,
a
grant
of
a
right
to
recover,
substantive
right
to
recover
money
damages
against
the
united
states
when
the
medicare
act
is
violated
or
not
followed
allegedly
by
a
carrier.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions
that
have
held
that.
there
have
been...
it
happens
not
all
that
infrequently
that
an
individual
claimant
will
sue
a
carrier,
and
the
standard
procedure
for
the
united
states
is
to
seek
to
have
the
case
removed
to
federal
court,
and
dismissed
on...
on
the
theory
that
the
carrier's
immunity
is
the
same
as
the
secretary's
immunity.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right,
for...
particularly
for
purposes
of
section
405(h).
that's
correct.
now,
returning
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
most
important
protection
is
the
secretary's
oversight
of
the...
of
the
carrier's
performance.
this
was
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
argument
this
morning
and
also
in
our
brief
in
mcclure.
there
are
a
number
of
ways
in
which
the
secretary
monitors
the
carrier's
performance
under
the...
under
the
contracts,
including
a
review
of
the
hearings
that
are
conducted,
and
annual
contract
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
no...
there
is
no
provision
in
the...
in
the
act
for
that
to
be
done
as
an
initial
matter.
the
overall
conduct
of
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
secretary
and
the
carrier
would
be
principally
a
matter
between
the
two
parties,
i
should
think,
so
the...
and
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
in
this
case
or...
that
i
am
aware
of
of
substantial
breakdowns
in
that
sort
of...
in
that
sort
of
contractual
relationship.
now,
as
i
mentioned,
under
the
tucker
act,
in
order
for
the
court
of
claims
to
have
jurisdiction,
it
is
necessary
to
find
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
respondent
concedes
that
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
medicare
act
and
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
specifically
that
congress
intended
to
remove
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
in
the
medicare
act.
now,
this
should
be
dispositive
of
the
case,
because
of
the
line
of
this
court's
decisions
concerning
tucker
act
jurisdiction
that
i
discussed
before,
but
i
think
this
is
particularly
so
when
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
part
b
medicare
program.
a
court
should
not
lightly
infer
that
congress
would
have
exposed
the
executive
and
judicial
branches
to
the
possibility
of
suit
without
regard
even
to
the
amount
in
controversy
every
time
a
carrier
is
alleged
to
have
made
an
error
in
the
particular
computation
of
the
amount
due
on
a
particular
claim
or
the
application
of
a
regulation
or
instruction
to
a
particular
claim.
these
determinations
generally
involve
a
relatively
small
amount
of
money,
often
involve
the
exercise
of
medical
judgment,
and
in
addition,
the
reimbursible
reasonable
charge
for
a
particular
service
may
vary
from
locality
to
locality,
and
in
fact,
it
was
precisely
for
this
reason
that
congress
chose
to
rely
on
the
expertise
of
the
carriers
who
service
the
particular
areas
to
determine
the
reasonable
charge
rates.
but
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
rely
only
on
the
nature
of
the
part
b
program
and
respondent's
concession
that
there
is
nothing
specific
in
the
medicare
act
consenting
to
suit,
for
in
this
case
the
text
and
the
legislative
history
of
part
b
demonstrate
convincingly
that
congress
intended
to
foreclose
review
of
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
benefits
due
in
a
particular
case.
indeed,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
congress
could
have
expressed
its
intent
any
more
clearly.
first,
the
text
of
the
medicare
act
makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
expose
the
united
states
to
suit
in
these
circumstances.
of
particular
significance,
we
submit,
is
section
1395(ff)
of
title
42.
this
is
the
provision
in
the
medicare
title
of
the
social
security
act
that
deals
with
the
circumstances
under
which
an
individual
beneficiary
is
entitled
to
judicial
review
of
matters
under
the
medicare
program.
section
1395(ff)
provides
for
judicial
review
under
part
a,
the
hospital
program,
both
with
respect
to
the
individual's
entitlement
to
participate
in
the
program
at
all,
in
other
words,
his
initial
enrollment,
and
in
addition,
in
certain
circumstances
with
respect
to
individual
claims
for
reimbursement
for
hospital
services,
although
the
act
provides
for
judicial
review
only
where
the
amount
in
controversy
is
$1,000
or
more.
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program,
however,
1395(ff)
provides
for
judicial
review
at
the
behest
of
the
beneficiary
only
with
respect
to
his
initial
enrollment
in
the
part
b
program,
whether
he
is
entitled
to
enroll,
and
whether
there
is
any
factual
question
about
whether
he
has
enrolled.
1395(ff)
does
not
contain
a
provision
for
judicial
review
of
benefit
determinations,
and
we
regard
this
as
quite
significant,
because
that
is
the
only
section
that
deals
with
a
beneficiary's
right
to
judicial
review.
therefore,
the
clear
import
of
congress's
provision
of
judicial
review
in
one
circumstance,
one-half
of
the
program
and
not
the
other,
would
appear
to
be
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
judicial
review
under
part
b.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
although
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
if
this
were
a
standard
apa
type
judicial
review
of
agency
action,
that
would
be
so,
but
there
is
another
feature
of
the
medicare
act
which
runs
up
against
that
presumption,
and
that
is
section
405(h),
but
while
this
case
specifically
concerns
the
court
of
claims'
tucker
act
jurisdiction,
we
submit
that
the
provisions
that
congress
has...
or
congress's
failure
to
provide
some
other
method
of
judicial
review
is
equally
relevant,
because
again
the
standard
provision
for
judicial
review
of
determinations
under
the
social
security
act,
whether
it
is
under
the
old
age
and
survivor
portion
or
under
part
b
of
medicare,
or
ssi,
is
through
section
405(g)
of
the
social
security
act,
standard
review
in
the
district
court,
and
an
action
filed
within
60
days
after
the
individual
determination
by
the
secretary
that
is
being
challenged.
now,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that...
and
incidentally,
i
should
add
that
the
court
of
claims
has
held
that
it
is
without
jurisdiction
over
individual
social
security
claims
in
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
because
congress
has
established
this
separate
statutory--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
if
there
would
be
review
anywhere,
it
would
ordinarily
be
the
district
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
but
congress
has
separately
addressed
that
problem
by
barring
review
there,
but
the
court
of
claims
has
inappropriately
applied
the
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
to
the...
to
the
court
of
claims
in
which
the...
the
opposite
principles
apply
that
a
right
of
action
does
not
exist
unless
congress
has
affirmatively
granted
it.
now,
it
does,
going
back
for
a
moment
to
the
fact
that
congress
has
provided
for
judicial
review
in
other
circumstances
under
the
social
security
act
in
section
405(g),
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
have
somehow
thought
that
that
particular
form
of
review
is
inappropriate
for
part
b
medicare
claims,
and
decided
that
somehow
the
court
of
claims
would
be
a
better
forum
for
those
particular
disputes.
in
fact,
one
would
assume
that
exactly
the
contrary
would
be
true,
because
these
are
relatively
small
claims
for
which
congress
would
more
reasonably
have
wanted
to
have
review
in
the
district
courts,
not
concentrated
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
respondent
has
suggested
that
the
failure
of
congress
to
provide
for
judicial
review
in
1395(ff),
which
contains
the
judicial
review
provisions
of
the
medicare
act,
is
not
significant
because
individual
reimbursement
disputes
are
handled
under
another
section
of
the
medicare
act,
1395(u),
which
is
the
section
dealing
with
the
carriers'
obligations.
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
that
congress
didn't
provide
for
judicial
review
of
a
carrier's
decision
under
that
section,
either.
so,
in
the
only
two
sections
that
respondent
has
identified
as
being
relevant,
there
is
an
absence
of
any
provision
for
judicial
review,
and
we
think
that
this
is
particularly
significant
again
in
light
of
section
405(h)
of
the
social
security
act.
the
second
sentence
of
section
405(h)
provides
that
no
findings
of
fact
or
decision
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
tribunal
except
as
specifically
provided
in
the
act,
and
as
incorporated
in
the
medicare
act,
that
would
mean
except
as
specifically
provided
in
the
medicare
act,
and
as
i
have
mentioned,
there
is
no
such
provision.
now,
as
justice
stevens
asked,
it
is
our
position
that
the
carrier
for
these
purposes
and
for
purposes
of
section
405(h)
and
the
manifest
congressional
purpose
underlying
it,
that
the
preclusion
of
judicial
review
by
any
other
tribunal,
and
that
would
include
the
court
of
claims,
would
apply
equally
to
part
b
claims
as
it
would
apply
to
part
a
claims.
if
there
were
any
doubt
lingering
after
examination
of
the
text
of
the
medicare
act
regarding
congress's
intent
to
foreclose
judicial
review,
we
think
that
would
be
dispelled
by
an
examination
of
the
legislative
history
of
both
the
original
1965
act
and
the
1972
amendments
to
the
act.
we
have
set
forth
that
legislative
history
at
pages
27
through
30
of
our
opening
brief,
and
at
pages
7
through
9
of
our
reply
brief.
of
particular
significance
is
the
passage
in
the
senate
report
which
outlines
the
different
means
of
review
of
determinations
under
part
a
and
part
b.
the
senate
report
points
out
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
by
the
secretary
and
judicial
review
under
part
a
where
there
is
at
least
$1,000
in
controversy,
but
under
part
b,
the
senate
report
points
out
that
the
carriers
would
review
beneficiary
complaints
regarding
the
amount
of
benefits,
and
"the
bill
does
not
provide
for
judicial
review
of
a
determination
concerning
the
amount
of
benefits
under
part
b
where
claims
will
probably
be
for
substantially
smaller
amounts
than
under
part
a..
"
congress
had
made
a
legislative
judgment
that
in
the
generality
of
cases,
the
sorts
of
claims
that
would
arise
under
part
b
were
relatively
trivial
amounts,
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
burden
the
courts
with
reviewing
that.
but
congress
just
didn't
do
this
in
1965,
it
revisited
the
statute
in
1972
and
revisited
the
judicial
review
provisions
because
some
lower
courts...
court
decisions
had
carved
out
what
appeared
to
be
an
unintended
loophole
allowing
beneficiaries
under
part
a
and
part
b
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
essentially
coverage
questions
as
to
whether
a
particular
service
was
covered
by
the
statute,
without
regard
to
the
amount
of
controversy
under
part
a,
and
without
regard
to
the
absence
of
any
judicial
review
generally
under
part
b,
and
this
was...
the
introduction
and
passage
of
this
is
discussed
on
page
30
of
our
brief.
senator
bennett,
who
introduced
the
revisions
to
1395(ff),
pointed
out
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the...
of
congress
in
1965
to
keep
these
relatively
small
claims
out
of
court
when
it
enacted
the
1965
act.
the
conference
reported
adopted
senator
bennett's
language,
and
the
conference
report
states,
the
senate
amendment
added
a
new
section
to
the
house
bill
which
would
make
clear
"that
there
is
no
authorization
for
an
appeal
to
the
secretary
or
for
judicial
review
on
matters
solely
involving
amounts
of
benefits
under
part
b..
"
now,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
how
congress
could
have
expressed
its
intent
any
more
clearly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
suppose,
but
it
did--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is...
it
is
expressed
in
the
act
in
our
view
in
section
405(h)
of
the...
in
section
405(h)
of
the
social
security
act,
the
preclusion
of
judicial
review
is
expressed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
certainly
as
to
tucker
act
jurisdiction,
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
established
rule
and
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
could
add
a
few
things,
first,
with
respect
to
the
contract
claim,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
respondent
did
not
assert
a
contract
with
the
united
states
as
the
basis
of
tucker
act
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
jurisdictional
provision
of
the
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
referred
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
not,
mr.
justice
stevens,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
about
70
percent
of
the
benefits
paid
out
under
the
part
b
program
are
paid
out...
are
contributions
from
the
federal
treasury.
only
about
30
percent
are
paid
by
the
individual.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
expected
when
it
was
enacting
the
part
b
program
with
large...
in
large
measure
funded
by...
out
of
the
general
treasury
that
somehow
part
b
claims
took
on
a
different
character
than
other
sorts
of
social
security
benefits.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
i
think...
i
think
whether--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
that's
true.
no,
that
is...
that
is
true,
but
all
the
means
is
that
congress
has
simply
made
a
person's
eligibility
to
participate
in
the
program
voluntary,
and
in
fact
under
the
social
security
act
the
payment
of
taxes
may
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
not...
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
wouldn't,
because
congress
did
not...
as
i
say,
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
this
to
suggest
that
congress
believed
it
was
entering
into
a
contractual
relationship.
it
simply
means
that
the
payment
is
voluntary.
the
receipt
of
social
security
benefits
is
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
a
person
doesn't
have
to
file
an
application
for
them,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
or
not
a
person
voluntarily
participates
is
not
the
point.
but
i
think
the
more
central
point
here
is
that
even
assuming
that
there
is
a
contract,
one
provision
of
that
contract,
as
respondent
characterizes
it,
derives
from
the
act
itself.
congress
offers
an
insurance
program,
the
beneficiary
accepts
it.
well,
one
of
the
provisions
of
that
contract
would
necessarily
be
the
preclusion
of
review
that
is
contained
in
the
very
same
statute
that
respondent
says
creates
a
contract.
so
that
the
contract
argument
here
simply
does
not
advance
their
argument.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that
is
not...
that
is
not
involved
in
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
absolutely,
it
is
on
the
face
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
also
the
acceptance
of
assignments
by
respondent
was
entirely
voluntary
here.
respondent
could
have
instead
allowed
the
patients
to
submit
their
part
b
claims
to
the
carrier.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
mention
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question
that
respondent
suggests
is
involved
here,
the
only
constitutional
question
this
court
has
suggested
might
arise
in
a
case
involving
judicial
review
is
if
there
is
preclusion
of
judicial
review
of
a
constitutional
question,
and
even
then
the
court
hasn't
said
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
simply
that
it
would
raise
a
constitutional
question.
well,
that
issue
simply
isn't
involved
here.
the
court
of
claims
rejected
respondent's
constitutional
objections
to
the
method
of
reimbursement
in
this
case.
respondent
has
not
sought
review
of
that
decision,
and
it
is
simply
not
involved
here.
all
that
is
involved
is
respondent's
objection
to
the
manner
in
which
the
carrier
calculated
the
claims
as
a
matter
of
administrative
procedure,
and
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
and
in
fact
the
veterans'
program,
for
example,
that
involved
in
johnson
v.
robison,
there
is
no...
it
is
quite
plain,
and
it
was
an
assumption
of
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
v.
robison
that
the
ordinary
benefits
claim
under
the
veterans
act
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
and
that
is
all
that...
that
is
the
only
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
thank
you--
