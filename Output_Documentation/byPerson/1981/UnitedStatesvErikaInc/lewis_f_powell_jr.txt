justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
have
three
cases.
the
fist
two
involve
statutory
provisions
that
are
not
entirely
suitable
for
oral
delivery.
accordingly,
i
will
simply
identify
the
issues
and
the
judgment
of
the
court.
the
first
of
these
is
80-1594,
united
states
against
erika.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
claims,
the
question
was
whether
that
court
had
jurisdiction
to
review
decisions
made
by
private
insurance
carriers
of
the
amount
of
benefits
payable
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program.
on
the
basis
of
the
explicit
statutory
language,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
claims
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
we
accordingly
reversed
its
judgment.
