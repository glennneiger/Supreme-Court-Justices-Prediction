mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
there
is
some
agreement
between
the
government
and
erika
on
some
of
the
issues
that
were
discussed
by
mr.
kneedler
and
also
earlier
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
mcclure
case.
those
points
of
agreement,
i
think,
add
up
to
acknowledging
erika's
central
proposition
to
this
court
today,
which
is
that
under
these
circumstances
where,
as
was
earlier
conceded,
a
unique
or
sui
generis
system
has
been
evolved
to
deal
with
27
million
covered
beneficiaries
in
a
voluntary
program,
where
$11
a
month,
going
to
$12.20
soon,
i
understand,
is
paid
in
premiums,
is
delegated
fully
and
finally
with
no
judicial
recourse
anywhere
to
a
private
insurance
carrier.
and
it
is
our
proposition
today
that
due
process,
meaning
some
review
by
some
court,
is
fundamental
in
this
circumstance,
and
given
the
particular
context
in
which
erika's
claim
a
rose,
namely,
a
claim
by
assignment
in
this
case
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
for
part
b
benefit
claims,
money,
that
the
appropriate
forum
to
review
at
least
the
constitutional
and
statutory
aspects
of
that
claim
is
the
united
states
court
of
claims
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--i
would
say
in
that
case
that
you
would
go
to
the
test,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
court
articulated
in
mathews
and
eldridge,
and
balance
the
interest
if
there
was
an
unequivocal
indication
that,
i
think
as
you
asked
earlier,
there
bad
been
no
intent
to
provide
any
review.
the
starting
point
in
that
analysis
has
to
be
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
intent
has
bean
expressed
to
wholly
deny
judicial
review.
in
this
case,
we
are
in...
we
are
in,
in
my
judgment,
at
least,
a
stronger
position
in
insisting
that
due
process
requires
judicial
review,
because
you
don't
even
have
an
agency
of
the
government
which
has
been
presumed
at
more
fairly,
at
least
in
many
cases,
making
the
review
through
an
alj,
where
you
have
a
private
insurance
carrier
with
a
built-in
bias
interest
that
was
pointed
out
in
mcclure
making
a
total
and
final
determination
if
the
government
is
right.
but
the
specific
answer
to
your
question
is,
you
would
have
to
look
at
whether
congress
had
clearly
and
unequivocally
intended
to
deny
any
right
of
review
from
the
administrative
decision
in
the
government,
and
then
see
on
the
balancing
test
under
mathews
and
eldridge
whether
in
this
court's
judgment
that
was
still
an
appropriate
action
for
congress
to
take.
the
only
instance
that
i
have
been
able
to
locate
in
the
cases
that
the
government
cited
where
there
hasn't
been
a
specific
provision
for
such
a
review
would
be
in
the
veterans'
benefit
cases,
for
example,
johnson
and
robinson,
although
that
case
didn't
go
off
on
at
such,
which
seems
to
have
been
the
review
issue
recognized
by
congress
as
a
special
area,
because
they
view
pensions
as
a
special
area,
and
there
is
legislative
history
in
that
area
which
you
cited
in
johnson
and
robison
where
senator
george
in
1940
says,
in
substance,
we
just
have
always
seen
pensions
as
different,
and
you
don't
get
judicial
review
because
we
want
a
uniform
system,
which
today
would
be
treated
again,
i
think,
by
this
court
on
a
mathews
and
eldridge
balancing
test,
but
the
fact
is--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
government
and
erika
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
well
as,
i
think,
eight
of
the
nine
circuits
that
have
considered
the
issue
disagree.
the
government
refers
in
its
brief
and
again
today
to
erika's
concession
that
there
is
no
review
provided
in
the
tucker
act
for
money
claims.
that
is
not
the
concession
in
our
brief,
read
carefully
and
fairly.
it
is
not
the
concession
which
we
make
here
today.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
think
that
is
pretty
much
the
question
i
have
tried
to
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
and
my
view
would
be,
if
it
is
clearly
and
unequivocally
expressed
and
you
apply
the
mathews
and
eldridge
balancing
test
of
private
interest,
government
interest--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
this
is
the
question
that
the
circuits
have
come
up
against,
and
every
one
of
them
has
said--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--my
answer
is
that
where
the
protective
property
right,
which
the
government
has
conceded
today
again,
is
involved,
you
can't
take
it
away
without
some
right
of
review
in
a
court,
at
least
a
property
right
of
this
nature,
which
we
say
is
contractual,
unlike
the
right
in
salfi
under
the
social
security
act--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--no.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
we
would
say--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--we
would
say--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--we
would
say
in
some
cases
that
the
mandamus
statute
may
be
properly
invoked
against
the
secretary
if
his...
if
his
action
is
egregious
enough
and
if
there
is
no
money
claim
which
can
otherwise
be
presented
in
the
court
of
claims.
this
case,
or
the
implications
of
this
case
are
surely
broader
than
the
issue
which
is
before
you
here,
but
it
happens
that
the
case
is
so
framed
because
erika
did
have
a
claim
for
money,
and
the
court
of
claims
had
said,
starting
in
1976,
in
the
whitecliff
case,
that
it
would
take
jurisdiction
of
such
cases
because
it
did
not
feel
it
was
precluded
either
by
salfi
or
405(h)
in
these
limited
circumstances
from
examining
constitutional
or
statutory
violations
of
the
medicare
act
in
the
context
of
examining
or
deliberating
upon
money
claims
made
by
the
carrier
below.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
that's
right.
we
say
that
we
stand
in
the
beneficiary's
shoes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
would
say
principally,
mr.
justice
stevens,
because
the
beneficiary
here,
rather
than
simply
having
benefitted
as
someone
whose
wages
were
taken
involuntarily
over
the
course
of
his
working
life
under
the
social
security
system,
has
voluntary
agreed
with
the
government
to
make
an
extra
payment
monthly,
which
as
i
say
is
now
$11,
in
order
to
have
the
benefit
of
part
b
coverage.
he
has
stepped
forward
and
agreed
to
enter
into
an
undertaking
that
is
different
in
kind
and
amount
that
anybody
enters
into
in
any
other
benefit
program,
including
social
security.
in
return
for
that,
he
is
entitled
to
the
assurance
that
the
claims
will
be
paid
in
accordance
with
the
statute
and
the
regulation,
and
ultimately
that
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
either
the
beneficiary
or
the
carrier
in
this...
the
provider
who
was
supplied
by
assignment
is
going
to
be
paid
in
accordance
with
this
reasonable
charge
language
in
the
statute.
one
of
the
problems
here,
as
the
court
of
claims
saw,
was
that
the
statute
on
its
face
was
not
being
honored
by
the
carrier
in
the
fair
hearing.
the
constitutional
claim
that
we
raise
which
was
a
denial
of
just
compensation
under
the
due
process
clause,
was
denied,
but
the
court
of
claims,
as
its
decision
makes
clear,
found
fundamentally
that
the
statute
on
its
face
as
applied
by
the
carrier
had
not
been
honored.
there
was
for
erika
here
as
for
other...
as
for
other
suppliers
in
other
instances
no
other
place
to
go
in
this
circumstance,
if
the
government
is
right
that
the
court
of
claims
is
foreclosed.
although
the
government
in
its
brief
has
attempted
to
mitigate
or
downplay
the
implications
of
its
position,
it
has-argued
consistently,
to
my
knowledge,
since
at
least
1976
in
every
circuit
and
in
the
court
of
claims
that
congress
intended
that
there
being
no
review
of
any
type
of
benefits
denial
under
part
b,
no
matter
how
egregious
the
denial...
the
action
by
the
carrier,
including
the
affirmation
in
the
fair
hearing.
the
answer
to
the
question
that
was
posed
earlier,
i
think,
which
was
that
the
secretary
himself
could
be
expected
to
be
the
final
authority
who
would
ensure
that
at
in
effect
due
process
was
done
is
illusory,
and
not
really
accurate.
there
is
no
more
reason
to
believe
that
the
secretary
is
going
to
deal
ultimately
in
a
due
process
sense
fully
and
fairly
with
law
questions
under
the
statute
and
certainly
under
the
constitution,
the
latter
being
beyond
his
authority
anyway,
than
the...
than
the
hearing
officer
will,
and
that
is
the
vice
of
the
system.
the
mcclure
joint
appendix
makes
it
clear
that
the
hearing
officer,
and
we
would
say
the
alj
if
judge
orrick's
decision
was
going
to
be
sustained,
are
in
exactly
the
same
position,
and
that
joint
appendix,
at
21
and
51
respectively,
points
out
that
the
authority
of
the
hearing
officer
is
limited
to
the
extent
that
he
must
comply
with
all
provisions
of
title
18
of
the
act,
all
regulations,
all
hcfa
rulings,
general
instructions
and
other
guides
issued
by
hcfa
or
the
medicare
bureau.
the
hearing
officer
does
not
have
the
prerogative
of
overruling
the
provisions
of
the
law
or
interpreting
them
in
a
way
different
than
that
of
the
medicare
bureau
when
he
is
in
disagreement
with
their
intent,
nor
may
he
use
hearing
decisions
as
a
vehicle
for
commenting
upon
the
legality,
constitutionality,
or
otherwise
of
the
provisions
of
the
program.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
his
authority
is
definitively
restricted
by
these
parameters.
so,
if
the
secretary,
as
my
brother
has
argued,
is
overlapping
and
fully
to
be
seen,
which
in
fact
he
is
not,
since
you
don't
get
a
review
to
the
secretary
under
the
government's
position
at
all,
nor
do
you
get
an
appeal
to
the
secretary,
but
to
the
extent
they
find
the
secretary
in
his
functions
overlapping
with
the
hearing
officer,
the
manual
itself,
which
is
before
you
in
the
joint
appendix,
makes
it
clear
that
in
effect
whatever
the
interpretation
is
that
hcfa,
the
child
of
hhs,
puts
on
the
statute
or
the
regulations
is
going
to
be
binding
both
on
the
hearing
officer
and
on
the
secretary
in
this
supposed
watchdog
function.
in
effect
the
question,
i
think,
becomes
the
old
one
of
who
is
watching
the
watchdog
where
there
is
no
judicial
recourse,
when
the
watchdog
is
supposed
to
be
watching
the
carrier,
with
all
the
interest
that
you
heard
earlier.
well,
the
government's
answer,
fairly
put,
here
is,
no
one
is
watching
their
watchdog,
the
secretary
of
hhs,
and
that
is
the
vice,
if
they
mean
their
concession
today,
which
i
am
sure
they
do,
namely,
that
due
process
requires
some
opportunity
for
a
review
by
a
fair
tribunal
when
property
is
about
to
be
taken,
and
the
government
has
conceded
here
and
in
other
cases
before
this
at
lower
levels
that
this
interest
under
part
b
benefits
is
a
property
interest.
to
address
the
second
aspect
of
where
we
find
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
besides
the
contractual
relationship
which
we
say
erika
enjoys
both
as
a
third
party
beneficiary
and
in
its
own
right,
that
is
in
a
reading
of
the
medicare
statute
itself.
now,
in
testan,
this
court
said,
and
in
other
cases
which
the
government
and
we
have
cited,
that
sovereign
immunity
waiver
can
be
found
in
the
tucker
act
by
reference
to
a
substantive
right,
either
a
contract
right,
which
i
argue
is
present
here
in
several
respects,
or
in
a
statute
fairly
read.
the
government
continues
to
confuse
in
my
view
the
notion
that
you
have
to
look
to
that
outside
statute
with
its
substantive
rights
in
effect
to
fill
the
tucker
act
jurisdictional
vessel,
as
if
that
statute
itself
need
state
explicitly,
yes,
you
may
sue
the
united
states.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
testan
or
any
of
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
in
fact
stand
for.
they
stand
for
the
proposition,
as
you
said
there,
that
you
have
to
find
the
substantive
right
to
money
damages
or
compensation
in
the
other
statute,
not
the
right
to
sue.
indeed,
were
it
otherwise,
the
tucker
act,
which
is
a
general
grant
to
sue
the
government
under
various
circumstances,
as
the
court
is
aware,
wouldn't
have
any
meaning,
because
you
would
have
to
go
ahead
on
every
statute
and
say,
as
the
congress,
and,
by
the
way,
the
tucker
act
may
be
invoked
if
things
go
awry
under
this
statute
and
you
have
a
money
claim
against
the
united
states.
the
fact
is
that
the
congress
has
known
when
it
wanted
to
very
clearly
how
to
limit
tucker
act
jurisdiction
when
it
would
otherwise
be
found
by
reference
to
some
other
statute
conferring
a
substantive
right,
either
by
contract,
as
here,
or
by
virtue
of
the
statute
itself,
as
here.
for
example,
i
believe
it
is
28
united
states
code
1500
to
1502,
provide
three
very
explicit
limitations
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims.
those
are
that
you
can't
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
where
you
have
brought
a
suit
in
some
other
court
in
substance
on
the
same
ground;
you
can't
sue
for
pension
rights...
that
same
theme
that
seems
to
be
a
special
area
of
the
congress...
and
you
can't
sue
for
rights
arising
under
treaties
with
foreign
nations.
so
that
congress
has
known
very
clearly
when
it
wanted
to
limit
tucker
act
jurisdiction,
which
the
court
of
claims
has
been
asserting
here
broadly
since
1976
how
to
do
it.
in
addition,
there
are
acts
like--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--that's
correct,
but
in
testan,
for
example,
when
you
examine
the
two
statutes
which
the
petitioners
had
pointed
to
for
the
substantive
rights,
there
being
no
contract
claim,
unlike
this
case,
you
found
that
neither
the
back
pay
act
nor
the
classification
act
conferred
a
substantive
right
for
money
damages
for
the
misclassification
that
had
gone
on.
by
contrast,
here,
under
the
medicare
statute,
we
are
looking
at
a
statutory
scheme,
an
insurance
policy,
as
i
think
you
yourself
described
this,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
salfi,
which
provides
for
payments
in
accordance
with
a
policy
term,
which
are
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
that's
correct,
and
i
tried
to
recognize
that
by
addressing
the
contractual
nature
of
the
relationship
here,
and
how
i
believe
it
differs
from
that
of
a
social
security
beneficiary
as
discussed
in
salfi.
in
addition,
to
follow
up
on
the
concern,
in
cases
like
the
veterans'
statutes,
in
robison,
specifically,
when
you
were
discussing
what
congress
had
done
there,
you
pointed
properly
to
explicit
statutory
bars,
not
silence,
which
the
government
insists
on
reading
as
a
concession
here,
but
explicit
statutory
bar
which
say,
the
decision
of
the
administrator
shall
be
final,
it
shall
not
be
reviewed
in
any
tribunal
anywhere
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
senator
bennett
and
the
other
decisions
which...
the
other
language
which
the
government
cites
in
its
legislative
history
record
indicates
clearly
a
congressional
concern
that
the
courts
not
be
flooded
with
administrative...
pure
administrative
review
decisions
under
part
b,
thousands
of
little
decisions.
as
the
government
has
argued
here
today,
however,
the
decisions
in
fact
are
fairly
few
in
number
that
are
not
resolved
in
some
respect
or
other
to
the
claimant
or
assignee's
benefit
ultimately
by
the
time
the
fair
hearing
is
over.
of
course,
the
government
would
also
like
to
have
it
both
ways,
because
they
have
argued
all
the
way
through
in
this
case
that
if
you
allow
the
court
of
claims
to
assert
its
own
jurisdiction
as
it
sees
it
here,
the
floodgates
are
open
and
that
court
will
be
flooded
with
thousands
of
claims.
well,
the
$1,000
limit
that
obviously
prevails
is
one
answer,
and
the
specialized
nature
of
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction,
including
the
money
requirement,
the
claim
against
the
united
states
requirement,
and
the
fact
there
are
no
jury
trials,
and
the
fact
that
you
have
to
come
to
washington,
d.c.,
which
is
expensive
for
most
claimants,
as
was
established
earlier,
all
answer
that
argument.
the
fact
is,
to
return
to
my
earlier
point,
when
the
congress
has
wanted
to
say
explicitly
no
review,
even
in
the
risk
of
the
constitutional
dilemma
which
the
court
has
rightly
posed
today,
it
has
known
how
to
say
it.
it
is
significant
in
addition
that
although...
and
although
it
is
not
cited
by
the
government
or
by
us
in
our
brief,
in
the
omnibus
reconciliation
budget
acts
of
the
last
two
years,
there
have
been
extensive
amendments
made
to
the
medicare
an
medicaid
legislation.
in
neither
instance
was
anything
done
to
address
this
issue
either
before
the
court
of
claims
decision,
but
in
the
five
years
after
the
whitecliff
decision,
or
in
the
face
of
the
court's
decision
last
year
in
whitecliff...
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i...
the
constitutional
issue
does
not
have
to
be
met,
because
we
say--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
i
understand
well
this
court's
concern
that
you
not
address
constitutional
conflict
like
that
if
you
need
not.
i
think
you
would
have
to...
you
would
have
to
agree
with
the
government
that
congress
explicitly
and
unequivocally
intended--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--then
i
think
you
have
a
constitutional
problem,
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
we
have.
that
is
at...
that
is
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
white,
starting
at
pages
28
on.
42
usc
405(b)
does
not
preclude
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
over
part
b.
the
united
states
position
unnecessarily
raises
serious
constitutional
questions.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
made
the
point
earlier,
i
hope,
that
where
a
property
right
is
involved,
where
there
is
this
concededly
unparalleled
allegation
to
a
private
entity,
here,
an
insurance
company,
sometimes
blue
cross-blue
shield,
to
make
final
and
irrevocable
decisions
about
the
disposition
of
that
property,
if
you
buy
the...
if
you
accept
the
government's
position,
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
about
whether
congress
acted
properly.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
accept
their
position,
for
the
reasons
i
have
suggested.
the
best
statement
of
the
dilemma
that
i
could
find,
i
sat
yesterday--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
i
say,
if
the
secretary
has
the
mechanism,
which
he
doesn't
here,
it
is
all
in
the
carrier,
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
to
the
secretary,
and
no
judicial
review
from
that
point,
then
you
go
back
and
look
at
your
language
about
the
clear
and
unequivocal
intent
of
congress
to
withdraw
jurisdiction,
and
if
you
find
that
you
still
have
to
apply
the
mathews
and
eldridge
three-pronged
test
balancing
those
interests,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
it
isn't
even
close
to
this
case,
because
the
government
has
made
it
clear
that
there
is
no
right
to
go
to
the
secretary--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--in
any
respect
on
a
part
b
benefit.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
if
you
agree
with
the
government
in
mcclure
that
the
district
court
should
be
reversed,
you
still
have
the
problem
of
decisions
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
or
regulations
or...
or
regulations
under
the
act
which
are
beyond
the
power
of
the
secretary
himself
to
deal
with,
because
he
is
the
secretary.
that
position
was...
was
summed
up
in
my
judgment
very
eloquently
by
justice
brandeis
in
the
st.
joseph
stockyard
case,
which
i
discovered
yesterday,
feeling
that
someone
here
would
want
to
know
penultimately
where
that
due
process
claim
is
ultimately
bottomed,
and
just
briefly,
he
said,
"when
dealing
with
constitutional
rights,
as
distinguished
from
privileges
accorded
by
the
government.
"
--of
course,
we
say
that
a
statutory
claim
here
is
something
less
than
a
constitutional
right
but
something
more
than
a
privilege
accorded
by
the
government...
"there
must
be
the
opportunity
of
presenting
in
an
appropriate
proceeding
at
some
time
to
some
court
every
question
of
law
raised,
whatever
the
nature
of
the
right
invoked
or
the
status
of
him
who
claims
it.
"
that
is
the
difference
really
between
an
article
iii
tribunal
and
the
matters
which
an
article
iii
court
like
this
one
or
the
court
of
claims
may
hear
and
matters
which
a
legislative
court,
so-called,
an
article
i
court
may
hear,
and
typically
the
secretary
has
been
held,
i
think,
in
repeated
decisions
of
this
court,
whether
of
this
department
or
any
other,
not
to
be
competent
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
by
definition
of
his
own
actions.
the
court
of
claims
has
said--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
the
tucker
act
is
an
explicit
decision
by
congress,
which
is
obviously
exemplified
in
other
areas,
too,
that
would--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--i
would
say,
given
the
nature
of
the
contractual
and
statutory
rights
involved
here,
if
i
have
fairly
defined
them,
the
answer
is,
no,
it
wouldn't
be
constitutional,
but
you
don't
have--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
i
see
a
difference
there,
because
in
buying
a
battleship
there
is
some--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
i
can't
answer
the
question
fairly,
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
posed
that
way,
but
i
think
there
is
a
freedom
of
contract
involved
in
dealing
in
that
situation
which
may
be
held
by
this
court
not
to
be
capable
of
being
vindicated
by
any
court,
but
here,
you
have
beneficiaries
who
have
agreed
to
pay
their
premiums
monthly
in
order
to
receive
payment
or
compensation
from
the
government
determined
by
a
reasonable
charge
mechanism,
which
is
defined
in
the
statute.
that
is
a
very
different
economic
and
legal
relationship,
in
my
judgment,
than
that
which
is
suggested--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--because
there
is
more
volition
or
voluntariness
involved
in
the
dealing
in
that
case.
you
don't
have
to
go
ahead
and
deal
with
the
government
to
buy
the
battleship.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
it
is
voluntary,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
the
final
analysis,
as
everyone
recognizes,
for
the
medical
protection
that
is
involved,
and
given
the
objective
of
congress,
which
was
to
assure
starting
in
1965
insurance
against
catastrophic
medical
expenses,
there
is
no
option
available
for
most
people
other
than
the
very
wealthy.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
say
it
is
a
voluntary
act,
but
it
has
to
be
seen
against
the
goals
of
congress
and
the
need
which
is
being
met,
which...
which
makes
it
in
a
practical
sense
mixed,
a
mixture
of
actions,
but--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--no,
it
didn't,
because
what
it
bargained
for
in
its
relationship
through
its
assignors
was
a
reasonable
charge
determination
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
what
the
court
of
claims
has
determined
was
that
by
taking
erika's
catalogues,
which
gave
one
price
for
one
point
in
time
from
12
to
24
months
earlier
than
the
period
for
which
compensation
or
reimbursement
was
being
made,
prudential
had
fundamentally
violated
the
statute.
we
wouldn't
have
a
complaint,
i
quite
agree
with
you,
as
erika
if
the
reimbursement
had
been
made
wholly
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
but
it
wasn't.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
it
took
a
risk
if
the
questions
weren't...
if
the
claims
weren't
paid
accurately
that
some
day
a
court
might
decide
there
was
no
recourse--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--but
you
have
to
read
the
statutes
with
hindsight
to
erika
as
mandating
no
recourse
rather
than
merely
as
being
silent
in
terms
of
judicial
review
through
the
district
courts
for
good
reason
to
come
up
with
that
conclusion.
i
don't
think
it's
fair
in
hindsight
to
say
that
erika
was
totally
on
warning
in
dealing
with
the
government
that
some
day
the
argument
would
be
made
here
and
accepted
by
this
court--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--it
puts...
it
puts
you
on
notice,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
you
are
not
going
to
get
review
in
the
district
court
as
part
a
beneficiaries
for
both
entitlement
and
benefits
and
part
b
beneficiaries
are
entitled.
it
doesn't
tell
you
that
when
you
have
been
able
to
reduce
the
issue
to
the
discrete
one
of
an
amount
of
money
being
claimed,
that
there
is
no
way
you
can
go,
given
the
existence
of
the
tucker
act,
and
what
we
say
is
the
fair
import
of
the
medicare
legislation,
to
provide
reasonable
charge
compensation
either
to
the
beneficiary
or
to
the
carrier
or
supplier
as
the
case
may
be
under
assignment.
so,
it
did
put
you
on
notice
particularly
with
the
government's
position
consistently
that
you
couldn't
go
to
the
district
court--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
say
that
it
is
enough
of
a
contract
case--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no,
because
if
i
understand
your
question,
there
was
there
either
apparently
an
article
i
tribunal
at
least
which
is
available
to
adjudicate
the
rights
of
the
parties.
here
there
is
not
even
an
article
i
tribunal
available,
if
the
government
is
right.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
that...
the--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--i
don't
think
i
can
better
answer
the
question
than
by
pointing
to
the
nature
of
the
bargaining
relationship
which
i
think
exists
in
that
hypothetical
on
the
one
hand
and
between
the
27
million--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
typically,
of
courage,
that
would
be
the
type
of
case
which
would
lie
within
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
if
on
the
balancing
test
you
found
that
the
property
interest
was
not
substantial
enough
in
the
party
contracting
with
congress--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--well,
sovereign
immunity
is
the
sovereign's
inherent
right
to
limit
its
suit.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
where,
as
here,
it
is
fairly
inferred
either
from
the
statute
or
from
a
contractual
relationship
or
both
that
there
is
some
recourse
for
this
limited
claim,
that
you
need
not
reach
a
constitutional
issue
of
the
magnitude
that
the
court
has
been
posing
to
me.
we
don't
think
that
is
this
case.
thank
you.
