unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
kneedler,
do
we
reach
this
if
we
affirm
the
last
case?
we
still
reach
this
issue,
do
we,
even
if
we
affirm
the
last
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
one--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question,
like
justice
brennan
did,
the
converse
of
his
question?
supposing
we
reversed
here
and
held
there
was
a
remedy
for
this
provider.
would
that
also
mean
there
would
be
a
remedy
for
the
part
b
claimant
in
the
other
case
in
the
court
of
claims?
in
other
words,
if
we
reversed
you,
would
that
mean
there
would
be
a
judicial
remedy
in
the
other
case,
the
one
we
just
had
argued?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
we
affirmed.
i
am
sorry.
if
we
affirmed
and
held
there
is
a
remedy.
unknown
speaker
but
let
me
rephrase
it.
if
we
found
there
was
a
remedy
for
a
provider,
would
it
necessarily
follow
there
would
also
be
a
remedy
for
the
insured?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
those
are
quite
different
questions,
i
suppose,
aren't
they?
i
mean,
you
could
lose
on
your
second--
unknown
speaker
--and
still
win
on
the
first.
unknown
speaker
and
waive
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
interrupt
again?
is
everyone
agreed
that
the
carrier
should
be
treated
as
though
it
is
an
agent
of
the
secretary
for
purposes...
and
that
there
could
be
no
private
action
in
a
state
court,
for
example,
against
the
carrier?
unknown
speaker
and
so
for
purposes
of
our
analysis,
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
carrier
really
is
the
secretary
within
the
meaning
of
all
the
relevant
statutes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler?
unknown
speaker
under
your
view,
would...
are
there
any
limitations
to
control
a
carrier's
discretion?
would...
if
the...
if
the
carrier
just
fails
to
fulfill
his
obligations,
what
is
the
injured
party
to
do?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
right
of
a
beneficiary
to
take
action
against
the
secretary
if
the
secretary
fails
in
the
duty
of
oversight?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
point
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
court
of
claims
or
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
is
just
a
question
of...
an
ordinary
question
of
reviewability
of
an
administrative
decision.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't...
in
that
context,
isn't
the
presumption
normally
in
favor
of
reviewability,
if
that
is
all
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
court
of
claims
is
right,
why
couldn't
anyone
just,
except
for
sovereign
immunity,
you
could
just
get
review
in
the
district
court,
if
they
are
right
about
reviewability.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
have--
unknown
speaker
--made
it
express
in
the
act,
mr.
kneedler.
unknown
speaker
then
you
wouldn't
be
here.
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
arguing
that
it
can't
be
implied.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
do
any
more
than
that,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you...
would
you
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the...
for
the
law
to
have
precluded
review
if
the
system
had
been
wholly...
if
the
claim
system
and
the
review
system
had
been
carried
out
by
government
officials,
by
the
secretary's
people
itself?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
to
be
able
to
get
into
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
get
into
court
in
the
first
place
if
congress
says
there
simply
is
to
be
no
judicial
review
of
these
decisions?
unknown
speaker
i
was
asking
a
hypothetical
question.
i
didn't
assume
that
you
had
conceded
the
point.
what
if
congress
says
in
the
authorizing
statute
there
is
to
be
no
judicial
review
in
any
court
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
get
to
mathews
and
eldridge
if
congress
says
there
shall
be
no
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
suit
against
the
united
states
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
suit
against
an
officer
who
is
an
ex
parte
young
officer.
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
could...
it
would
be
a
review...
it
would
be
review
of
an
erroneous
official
decision.
unknown
speaker
contrary
to
the
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
oleskey,
you
emphasize
the
point
that
you
rely
on
a
contractual
claim
here,
whereas
salfi
involve
a
claim
that
congress
could
revoke.
now,
do
you
claim
that
the
beneficiary
here
has
a
contractual
claim
as
well
as
your
having
sort
of
third
party
benefit?
unknown
speaker
and
why
does
the
beneficiary
here
have
a
greater
contractual
claim
than
a
social
security
claimant?
unknown
speaker
well,
testan
and
hopkins,
and
cases
like
that,
where
we
have
held
the
court
of
claims
overreached
itself
under
the
tucker
act,
certainly
weren't
barred
by
those
three
examples
that
you
gave
of
limitations
on
court
of
claims
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
salfi,
of
course,
was
described
as
an
insurance
policy,
but
clearly
there
is
no
contractual
right
under
fleming
against
nestor.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
senator
bennett's
statement
in
connection
with
the
1972
amendments,
where
they
found
some
of
the
lower
courts
were
allowing
the
thing
to
be
circumvented,
which
very,
very
frequently
happens?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we...
if
we
construe
the
act
together
with
such
history
as
the
government
contends,
then
must
we,
because
you
present
the
issue,
reach
a
constitutional
issue?
is
the
constitutional
issue
pressed
by
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
act,
properly
construed,
precludes
review
in
the
court
of
claims,
that
congress
intended
not
to
provide
the
review.
then,
are
you...
are
you
presenting
as
an
appellee
the
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
yes.
suppose
we
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
presented
it
as
an
appellee?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
most
you
say
about
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying...
apparently
your
submission
is
that
even
if
all
the
claims
machinery
was
inside...
was
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary's
own
people,
and
he
had
given
them
a
fair
hearing,
that
unless
judicial
review
is
provided,
we
have
a
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
if
we...
what
if
we
agree
with
the
government
in
the
other
case,
that
that
is
not
a
biased
procedure
or
anything
of
the
kind,
and
it
is
a
full
and
fair
hearing?
it
is
just
as
good
as
though
it
were
done
by
the
secretary
himself.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mr.
oleskey,
those
are
cases
involving
regulation
rather
than
contracting,
the
government
as
a
contracting
party.
you
contend
that
the
tucker
act
was
constitutionally
mandated,
i
guess,
that
the
united
states
would
be
without
power
to
enter
into
a
contract
without
giving
the
other
side
to
the
bargain
judicial
review
of
the
government's
performance.
unknown
speaker
we
are
just
confining
ourselves
to
the
constitutional
question.
would
it
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
enter
into
a
contract
and
authorize
somebody
on
behalf
of
the
government
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
a
private
party
and
say,
there
shall
be
no
judicial
remedy
against,
the
united
states
in
the
event
there
is
a
breach?
unknown
speaker
what
about
my
case?
just
a
simple,
special
statute
says,
in
buying
a
battleship,
you
can
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
shipbuilding
company,
there
will
be
no
contractual
right
against
the
united
states
on
that
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
there
is
a
difference
or
not,
do
you
doubt
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
why?
why
is
it
different
from
my
case?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
stressed
the
fact
that
this
was
voluntary
as
opposed
to
social
security.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
say
then
it
is
voluntary
or
it
is
not
voluntary?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
erika
was
concerned,
though,
it
presumably
knew
that
the
carrier
would
determine
what
reasonable
charges
are,
and
in
that
sense
it
got
exactly
what
it
expected
the
statute
would
get.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
aware
of
the
claim,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
erika
realized
when
it
undertook
to
enter
into
the
relationship
that
these
questions
were
going
to
be
answered
by
the
carrier,
and
took
that
risk.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
oleskey,
what
about
the...
what
about
the
language
on
page
27
and
28
of
the
government's
brief
on
the
legislative
history?
shouldn't
that
have
put
you
on
notice?
unknown
speaker
just
one
word,
counsel.
unknown
speaker
do
you
still
say
this
is
a
contract
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
a
contract
case?
unknown
speaker
you
still
say
that.
counsel,
there
are
a
number
of
acts,
and
one
comes
to
mind
particularly,
the
international
claims
act,
which
affirmatively
and
explicitly
provides
that
the
decision
of
the
international
claims
commission
will
be
final,
binding,
and
there
would
be
no
judicial
review,
so
that
eliminated
the
first
question
you
have
here.
do
you
suggest
that
that
kind
of
an
act
proposes
a
constitutional
question
of
the
right
of
congress
to
deny
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
offhand,
i
don't
know
whether
the
international
claims
commission
and
that
type
of
commission
is
an
article
i,
and
they
dealt
with
claims
in
the
post-war
period
running
into
millions
if
not
billions
of
dollars.
unknown
speaker
but
no
review
was
allowed.
the
congress
appears
to
have
been
particularly
concerned
about
rights
in
that
instance,
because
i
noted
in
looking
at
the
united
states
code
that
they
had
withdrawn
explicitly
tucker
act
jurisdiction
from
the
court
of
claims
over
such
claims.
again,
that
wasn't
done
here.
why
isn't
justice
stevens
absolutely
correct
in
suggesting
that
any
time
you
have
a
contract
with
the
united
states,
and
you
have
performed,
and
you
have
what
anybody
would
say
is
a...
is
a
justifiable
contract
claim
which
you
can
say
is
a
property
right,
there
certainly
is
an
expectation
of
being
paid,
why
wouldn't
you
say
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
united
states
to
claim
sovereign
immunity
in
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
united
states
promises
to
pay
upon
performance.
unknown
speaker
and
the
contractor
has
performed,
he
says.
unknown
speaker
yes,
only
the
united
states
just
happens
to
say
that
in
this
line
of
contracts,
there
will
be
no
tucker
act
jurisdiction.
we
are
asserting
our
sovereign
immunity.
now,
why...
wouldn't
that
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
saying
then
that
you
would
have
to
apply
some
kind
of
a
due
process
test
to
see
whether
sovereign
immunity
was
constitutional
or
not.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
kneedler,
isn't
the
quote
right
that
there
is
a
difference
between
this
claim,
where
there
is
a
voluntary
decision
by
the
beneficiary,
and
a
social
security
act
claim,
whereas
this
would
be
contractual
and
the
other
would
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what
about
the
30
percent?
unknown
speaker
is
he
right
that
the
beneficiary
has
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
participate,
which
is
not
true
of
social
security?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right?
i
am
just--
unknown
speaker
--well,
would
you
contend
that
fleming
against
nestor
would
apply,
that
congress,
after
collecting
the
money,
could
constitutionally
say,
we
have
decided
not
to...
we
just
decided
to
welsh?
unknown
speaker
we
just
call
the
program
off.
would
you
say
that...
at
least
the
nestor
case
doesn't
hold
that,
does
it?
it
would
not
apply
to
these--
unknown
speaker
--but
you,
in
order
to
win,
you
don't
have
to
take
the
extreme
position
that
the
government
could
simply
just
say,
we
are
not
going
to
pay
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
your
position
is
that
they
have
an
adequate
mechanism
for
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
any
obligation
in
a
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
also...
you
say
that
he
has
also
notified
him
in
advance
that--
unknown
speaker
--that,
by
the
way,
friend,
we
are
not
waiving
sovereign
immunity.
