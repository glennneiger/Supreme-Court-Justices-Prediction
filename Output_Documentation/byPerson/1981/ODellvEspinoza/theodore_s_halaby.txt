mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
a
confrontation
that
occurred
in
a
denver,
colorado,
city
park
between
three
officers
of
the
denver
police
department
and
the
father
of
the
respondents
and
a
companion
of
that
father.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
not
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
if
we
had
not
brought
the
case
here,
the
two
claims,
the
1983
survivorship
claims
brought
on
behalf
of
the
estate
and
the
personal
1983
claims
of
the
children
of
the
decedent,
both
would
have
been
remanded
for
trial
in
the
district
court
and
tried
there.
the
relief
petitioners
are
seeking--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--we
have
only
raised
one
issue,
and
that
deals
with
the
children
of
the
decedent,
the
respondents
herein,
and
whether
or
not
they
may
assert
personal
1983
claims.
we
have
not
raised
the
dismissal
of
the
1985
claims.
neither
have
respondents.
we
have
not
raised
the
dismissal
of
the
1983
claims
with
respect
to
the
chief
of
police,
who
was
sued
strictly
in
a
supervisory
capacity.
we
have
not
raised
the
dismissal
of
those
claims.
we
have
only
raised
the
finding
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
insofar
as
it
recognized
a
personal
constitutional
right
in
the
child
to
a
continuing
family
relationship,
which
would
afford
that
child
a
claim
pursuant
to
section
1983
for
deprivation
of
that
right.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that's
correct.
if
we
had
not
brought
the
case
here--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--there
is
a
final
judgment,
we
submit,
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
the
children,
because
unless
the
court
recognizes
that
constitutional
right
they
are
not
parties
to
the
action,
they
have
no
claims
whatsoever.
so
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
the
children
there
is...
unless
this
court
is
to
affirm
the
finding
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
those
children,
since
they
did
not
assert
their
state
rights
under
the
wrongful
death
statute,
they
would
have
no
claims,
they
would
not
be
parties
to
the
action.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
and
we
submit
they
did
so
erroneously
in
an
unprecedented
fashion.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
it
is
not
a
final
judgment
in
that
respect,
in
that
the
claims
have
not
been
tried
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
not
ruled
specifically
on
the
merits
of
those
claims.
however,
we
would
still
urge
consideration
by
this
court
because
of
the
profound
ramifications
of
this
finding,
not
only
in
the
state
of
colorado
but
nationwide.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
we
would
submit
that
because
it
is
a
decision
in
conflict
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
has
such
profound
consequences,
that
this
issue
is
ripe
for
the
consideration
of
this
court.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
i
believe
this
court...
it
does
fit
within
what
this
court
has
recognized
before
with
respect
to
fundamental
decisions
that
have
run
contrary
to
this
court,
which
is
what
we
asserted
in
our
petition
in
the
first
instance,
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
that
if
this
decision
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
is
left
unreversed
that
the
profound
negative
consequences,
which
we
submit
are
improper,
would
have
ramifications
that
are
uncorrected.
so
we
would
submit
that,
while
there
is
not
a
final
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
children's
claims,
since
they
have
not
been
tried
in
the
district
court,
that
it
is
still
an
issue
that
is
ripe
for
consideration
of
this
court.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
well,
in
either
instance,
justice
blackman,
if
we
won
or
they
got
less
than
that,
we
necessarily
would--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--we
would
have
won
our
case.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
unless
the
other
side
appealed
the
case,
of
course.
however,
the
law
would
still
stand
in
colorado--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--if
we
had
won
the
case,
justice
white,
the
law
would
remain
in
colorado--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--well,
based
on
the
decision
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
in
recognizing
the
constitutional
right
of
the
child,
that
alone
prevents
us
from
accomplishing
what
we
are
seeking.
of
course,
on
the
trial
on
the
merits
in
the
district
court
we
may
be
successful,
which
would
then
preclude
any
harm.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
the
alternative
ground
for
recovery
under
the
wrongful
death
statute?
no,
simply
because
the
respondent
children
have
not
sought
to
seek
their
remedy
under
the
state
wrongful
death
statute.
they
have
only
asserted
one
claim
and
that's
their
federal
claim
pursuant
to
section
1983.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
i
believe
they
still
can.
they
were
granted
leave
by
the
district
court
to
amend
their
claim.
they
chose
not
to,
but
stand
simply
on
their
1983
claim.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
well,
my
understanding
of
their
position
is
that
this
issue,
as
justice
o'connor
raised,
is
not
ripe
for
consideration
by
this
court.
i
do
understand
that
to
be
their
position.
and
so
therefore
they
ask
this
court
to
affirm
and
remand
the
rulings
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
which
would
seem
to
me
would
be
a
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that
was
one
of
the
alternatives,
justice
rehnquist,
that
was
suggested
by
the
amicus.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
vacate
on
the
grounds
of
certiorari
being
improvidently
granted,
similar
to
an
analogous
case
arising
out
of
colorado
in
the
jones
v.
hildebrant
case,
where
this
court
similarly
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
but
we
would
submit
that
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
this
court
to
decide
this
issue
at
this
time,
and
that
the
importance
of
this
issue
is
so
overwhelming
that
it
would
deserve
resolution
at
this
time.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
i
believe
what
justice
erickson
was
suggesting
was
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
went
far
beyond
the
issues
in
terms
of
trying
to
fashion
an
overall
remedy
in
consideration
of
1983
claims
being
asserted
in
state
courts.
and
i
believe
that
is
what
he
objected
to,
while
he
agreed
with
the
bottom
line
findings
of
the
court
in
terms
of
remanding
both
the
1983
survivorship
claims
of
the
estate
and
the
personal
1983
claims
of
the
children.
but
what
he
objected
to
was
the
court's
going
beyond
those
particular
issues
in
terms
that
he
felt
were
not
before
the
court,
in
terms
of
fashioning
an
overall
remedy
or
procedural
concept
in
how
the
state
court
should
handle
1983
claims.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
yes,
we
are
not
challenging
the
survivorship
right.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
yes.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
no,
justice
white,
we
would
submit
that
is
a
federal
law
question--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--as
determined--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--yes.
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
robertson
v.
wegmann
supports
that
finding.
we
do
not
contest
that
finding.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
no,
i
believe--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--i
believe
so.
i
believe
they're
mutually
exclusive
remedies.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
we
would
submit
that
either
under...
under
either
the
state
remedy
or
the
federal
remedy,
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
the
same.
under
the
survivorship
claims,
we
would
submit
that
the
remedy
provisions
under
the
state
survivor
statute
would
control
the
relief
that
could
be
obtained
pursuant
to
the
1983
survivorship
statute.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
it's
still
federal
law.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
robertson
v.
wegmann
would
support
that.
i
might
point
out
that
what
we
would
submit
has
been
considerable
confusion
concerning
the
construing
the
state
death
statutes,
the
wrongful
death
statute
and
the
survivor
statute,
with
claims
under
1983.
we
would
submit
particularly
in
this
instance
that
the
state
death
statutes
cannot
bear
any
relevance
as
to
whether
or
not
a
1983
claim
can
be
asserted
in
the
first
instance.
following
the
rationale
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
it
is
consistent
to
state
that
it
does
not
require
death
of
the
father
in
this
case
to
give
rise
to
the
1983
claim
in
terms
of
affecting
this
family
relationship
between
the
parent
and
child.
instead,
false
imprisonment
could
give
rise
and
would
be
the
same
type
of
intrusion
in
the
family
relationship
which,
according
to
the
colorado
supreme
court's
rationale,
would
afford
the
basis
for
the
child
to
assert
a
personal
1983
claim.
and
clearly,
if
the
father
is
not
dead
and
has
simply
been
removed
from
that
family
relationship,
albeit
for
life,
that
family
relationship
with
the
child
is
affected
almost
to
the
same
degree
as
if
the
father
was
dead.
yet
clearly,
with
the
father
not
being
dead
the
death
statutes,
the
wrongful
death
statute
and
the
survival
statute
of
colorado,
would
not
apply
in
any
instance.
therefore,
any
discussion,
we
submit,
that
the
remedies
provided
under
the
state
death
statutes
can
somehow
relate
to
claims
under
1983
has
no
basis.
the
finding
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
is
premised,
as
was
mentioned,
on
a
personal
liberty
interest
in
the
continuing
family
relationship
with
that
father.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
unprecedented
finding,
that
this
court
nor
any
other
appellate
court
has
ever
so
recognized
such
a
personal
constitutional
interest
in
a
child.
there
has
been
one
court
that
decided
the
issue
on
point.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
without
comment
an
opinion
of
the
illinois
district
court
in
evain
v.
conlisk
that
found
that
no
such
right
exists.
the
colorado
court,
we
submit
erroneously,
deduced
from
this
court's
finding
in
stanley
versus
illinois
that
this
court
recognized
a
constitutionally
protected
right
between
the
relationship
of
the
father
toward
the
child,
and
therefore
that
reciprocal
right
of
the
child
to
the
parent
must
also
exist.
but
petitioners
further
submit
that
that
was
an
erroneous
finding,
was
a
misinterpretation
of
stanley,
and
even
if
it
was
a
correct
interpretation
of
stanley
that
such
a...
there
was
a
constitutionally
protected
right
of
the
father
toward
the
child,
one
cannot
state
that
this
reciprocal
right
between...
of
the
child
to
the
parent
ipso
facto
exists.
that
is
a
right
of
a
different
kind,
of
a
different
nature,
and
whether
or
not
this
right
exists
must
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
principles
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
abortion
case
of
roe
v.
wade
as
to
whether
it
is
a
constitutional
liberty
interest
that
exists.
it
must
be
fundamental
or
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
and
what
has
normally
been
found
to
be
fundamental
or
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
normally
involves
those
choices,
freedom
of
choices
or
freedom
of
decisions,
such
as
a
parent
to
have
a
child
or
not
to
have
a
child.
and
with
respect
to
the
child's
relationship
with
the
parent,
this
does
not
involve
a
freedom
of
choice
or
a
decision.
it
is
a
happenstance,
of
course,
which
the
child
has
no
control
over.
and
we
have
found
this
carried
through
in
lawsuits
that
children
have
sought
to
bring
for
wrongful
life,
where
there
was
found
to
be
no
basis
in
fact
because
the
child
doesn't
have
any
choice.
so
therefore,
even
if
this
court
were
to
recognize
a
personal
liberty
interest
and
protection
of
the
parent
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
his
relationship
with
this
child,
that
reciprocal
constitutional
right
in
the
child
would
not
exist
with
respect
to
his
continuing
family
relationship
with
his
parent.
i
don't
think
one
needs
to
use
one's
imagination
to
any
great
degree
to
recognize
the
profound
ramifications,
not
only
upon
the
liability
of
public
entities,
but
on
the
federal
judiciary
itself,
because
if
this
concept
of
continuing
family
relationship
is
afforded
constitutional
protection
we
submit
that
even
the
slightest
state
intrusion
in
this
family
relationship
would
give
rise
not
only
to
one
1983
claim,
but
every
member
of
that
family
relationship
would
be
afforded
each
a
personal
1983
claim.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
in
what
respect,
justice
white?
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
we
submit
that
no
cases
have
recognized
such
a
right.
the
colorado
supreme
court
seemed
to
imply
in
its
decision
that
stanley
versus
illinois
recognized
such
a
right.
however,
we
disagree
with
that
decision
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
find,
nor
did
the
colorado
court
cite,
any
other
cases
that
would--
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
--yes,
we
disagree
with
the
interpretation
of
stanley.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
neither
would
have
a
claim.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
we
say
it
hasn't
been
recognized,
nor
would
it
exist,
that
the
parent
would
have
a
constitutionally
protected
relationship
with
the
child.
but
even
if
that
were
found
to
be
so,
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
found,
clearly
the
child
would
not
have
a
constitutionally
protected
relationship
with
respect
to
the
parent.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
well,
one
thing
it
would
do
is
serve
to
limit
the
number
of
claims,
which
of
course
wouldn't
go
to
the
finding
itself.
but
we
submit
that
the
family
relationship,
be
it
between
parent
and
child,
between
grandparent
and
child,
between
brothers
and
sisters,
simply
does
not
exist.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
if
the
state
does
not
have
a
survivorship
statute
that
allows
for
the
claims
of
a
decedent
to
survive
his
death,
then
there
would
not
be
a
means
of
bringing
the
federal
1983
claim.
however,
in
colorado
and
i
believe
all
states
now,
such
survivorship
statutes
exist.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
right.
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court
below.
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
the
child
will
be
successful
on
the
claim
that
has
now
been
recognized
by
the
colorado
supreme
court.
however,
we
again
submit
that,
while
that
claim
has
not
been
tried
on
its
merits,
the
issue
is
so
fundamental
and
contrary
and
has
such
wide-ranging
ramifications
that
it
nonetheless
is
ripe
for
decision
at
this
time.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
yes.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
yes,
that
was
exactly
what
our
position
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
s.
halaby
i'd
like
to
clear
up
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
with
respect
to
the
wrongful
death
and
survival
remedies.
i
think
it's
clear
to
the
justices
in
reading
other
decisions
that
often
other
courts
have
used
wrongful
death
and
survival
interchangeably
in
describing
their
particular
state
statute.
in
colorado
there
are
two
separate
statutes,
and
therefore
in
colorado,
because
there
is
a
survivorship
statute
that
allows
vindication
of
the
decedent's
deprivation
to
survive
his
death,
wrongful
death
is
an
entirely
different
animal.
and
we
submit
that
by
definition
there
cannot
be
a
wrongful
death
1983
claim,
because
by
the
nature
of
that
statute
under
wrongful
death
you'd
be
suing
for
deprivation
of
another's
civil
rights,
not
your
own
personal
civil
rights.
the
only
way
you
can
sue
for
deprivation
of
the
decedent's
civil
rights
is
pursuant
to
the
survivor
statute.
and
therefore
when
respondent
speaks
of
the
limitation
on
the
wrongful
death
statute
in
this
area
of
a
1983
claim,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
animal,
that
one
cannot
assert
a
1983
wrongful
death
claim.
now,
we
would
also
submit
that
what
the
respondent
is
seeking
to
do
is
to
fashion
a
right
to
fit
the
remedy,
as
opposed
to
fashioning
a
remedy
to
fit
the
right.
the
right
must
exist
irrespective
of
the
remedy,
and
we
must
have
the
right
before
we
can
even
consider
the
remedy.
but
what
respondent
is
urging
is,
because
of
the
remedies
available
under
the
survivorship
statute
and
under
the
wrongful
death
statute
in
colorado,
which
respondent
believes
is
not
substantial
enough,
this
court
should
now
fashion
a
right
that
would
provide
for
remedies
unrestricted
by
those
two
statutes.
we
submit
this
is
in
effect
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
by
recognizing
this
unprecedented
right
in
the
child
when
the
child
is
a
living
victim.
of
course
it
would
be
difficult
to
argue
that
wrongful
death
statute
or
a
survival
statute,
both
of
which
are
premised
on
death,
could
affect
a
living
victim,
the
child,
because
when
the
child's
rights
are
deprived
with
respect
to
a
continuing
family
relationship
that
child
becomes
the
victim.
the
father's
death
is
only
a
factual
circumstance
to
show
the
intrusion
into
that
family
relationship,
but
it
is
still
the
living
child
that
is
the
victim
and
therefore
logically
it
would
be
difficult
to
argue
that
the
death
statutes
could
limit
it
in
any
respect.
but
this
is
what...
this
we
submit
has
been
the
approach
of
the
respondent.
the
survivorship
limitation
with
respect
to
the
decedent's
rights
has
not
been
an
issue
presented
by
either
the
petitioners
or
the
respondents
in
the
petition
phase
or
in
the
issues
presented
by
petitioners
in
their
brief.
respondents
did
refer
to
the
wrongful
death
limitations
in
their
response
to
our
initial
petition.
but
respondents
did
not
address
the
limitation
with
respect
to
the
survivorship
statute
with
respect
to
the
decedent's
rights.
we
submit
that
is
not
in
issue
before
the
court.
but
if
this
court
chooses
to
consider
that
issue,
we
believe
the
answer
has
already
been
made
by
this
court
in
robertson
v.
wegmann
that
that
is,
the
survivorship
statute,
is
a
permissible
limitation
on
that
survivorship
claim.
thank
you.
