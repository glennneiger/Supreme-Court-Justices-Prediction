unknown
speaker
before
you
get
too
far
into
the
merits,
mr.
halaby,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
as
i
read
the
state
supreme
court's
opinion,
the
trial
court
had
dismissed
the
1983
action
on
a
motion
for
summary
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
the
remedy
was
exclusively
under
state
law
for
death
by
a
wrongful
act.
now,
on
that
basis
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
the
trial
court
and
said,
no,
you
should
not
have
had
summary
judgment
sending
it
back,
and
therefore
the
case
is
now
back
where
it
started
and
would
go
to
trial.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
not
brought
the
case
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
before
you
go
into
that,
did
you
raise
the
1985,
section
1985
question
here,
or
only
the
1983?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
it's
apparent
to
you
what
i'm
driving
at
is
whether
there
is
a
case
here,
whether
there
is
jurisdiction.
and
you
say
that
if
you
had
not
brought
the
case
here,
if
i
understood
you,
you
would
have
gone
to
trial
on
the
1983
question
in
the
state
court,
with
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
court
to
apply
federal
law.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
then
is
there
a
final
judgment
here?
unknown
speaker
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
upheld
those
claims.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
did
uphold
them,
it
was
simply
to
say
that
in
the
abstract
it
stated
a
claim
for
relief
or
what
have
you
under
section
1983,
and
that
the
trial
court,
i
take
it,
on
remand,
was
to
try
the
case.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
final
judgment
under
1257?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
aren't
there
only
about
four
exceptions
to
our
taking...
to
the
final
judgment
rule,
and
how
does
this
fit
into
any
of
those
exceptions?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
a
new
exception,
in
addition
to
any
that
we've
ever
recognized
before.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you
win
below?
what
if
there
had
been...
what
if
you
hadn't
come
here
and
there
were
a
remand
and
you
won,
or
if
the
children
got
less
than
$45,000.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
would
won
your
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
would
never
have
come
here.
unknown
speaker
if
they
brought
it
up
here
then,
it
may
be
that...
it
may
be
that
you
could
sustain
the
judgment
then
on
the
very
ground
you're
now
urging.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
sit
just
to
correct
errors
of
law.
we
still
decide
cases
and
controversies,
and
avoid
deciding,
our
deciding,
constitutional
questions
as
long
as
possible.
how
do
you
know
that
the
colorado
courts
won't
give
you
everything
that
you're
seeking?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
are
not
successful
on
that
issue,
then
you
might
be
able
to
come
here.
unknown
speaker
is
the
other...
is
the
alternative
ground
for
recovery
still
open
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
still
open,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
they
can
amend
their
claim,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
understand...
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
position
of
the
amicus
in
this
case,
the
aclu?
unknown
speaker
certainly
if
we
affirm.
unknown
speaker
but
their
first
suggestion
is
to
vacate,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
could
you
help
me
with
one
other
procedural
question?
i
had
some...
i
wasn't
sure
i
entirely
understood
your
justice
erickson's
concurring
opinion.
he
said
that
the
majority
didn't
really
need
to
decide
what
it
did,
because
it
could
remand
on...
just
on
the
survivorship
claim,
is
that
what
he
was
saying.
unknown
speaker
did
i
correctly
understand
that
on
remand,
as
things
stand
now,
there
may
be
a
death
claim
on
behalf
of
the
children
for
the
injury
to
their
relationship
to
their
father,
the
loss
of
the
father;
and
secondly,
there
may
be
a
survivorship
claim
on
behalf
of
the
estate
for
the
injury
to
the
man
himself?
and
you're
not...
under
1983...
and
you're
not
challenging
the
latter?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
the
cause
of
action
that
the
deceased
had
under
1983
survives?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
state
law
question,
isn't
it,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
it
is,
you
agree
it
survives?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
lost
on
both
of
the
claims
that
would
be
open
on
remand,
the
survivorship
claim
and
then
this,
the
personal
1983
claim
of
the
children,
if
you
lost
them
both
one
wouldn't
cancel
out
the
other,
i
take
it,
or
would
they?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
recovery
in
one
would
be
added
to
the
other?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
with
respect
to
each
of
them,
the
federal
recovery
would
be
larger
than
the
state
law
recovery,
because
they
include
these
personal
elements
of
damage
other
than
pecuniary
damages,
or
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
won't
that
be
because
we
borrowed
colorado
law?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
still
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
but
we
borrowed--
--what
supports
that,
may
i
ask?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
parent's
interest
in
the
child?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that...
have
any
cases
recognized
that
as
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
the
parent's
relationship
with
the
child?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
disagree
with
stanley
or
with
the
decision...
with
the
reading
of
stanley?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that
if
a
30-year-old
man
were
killed
by
the
police
his
children
would
have
no
cause
of
action,
but
his
parents
would?
neither?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
about
the
reciprocal
business
would
not
defeat
a
claim
by
the
grandparents,
though,
would
it?
you
argued,
as
i
understood
you,
that
stanely
would
stand
for
the...
arguably
might
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
parent
has
an
interest
in
the
relationship,
but
the
child
does
not.
unknown
speaker
so
that
rule
would
protect
against
suits
by
the
children,
but
not
against
suits
by
the
parents.
unknown
speaker
ironic
to
say
that
the
grandparent
had
a
greater
interest
in
the
child.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understood
your
basic
position,
or
a
least
one
of
your
positions,
was
that
the
matter
of
the
survivorship
rights
is
purely
a
matter
of
state
law
for
state
statute,
and
that
if
the
state
statute
does
not
recognize
any
rights
in
a
survivor
there
are
none.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
yet
whether
the
state
courts
will
recognize
under
the
federal
law
that
was
asserted
the
rights
claimed,
until
you
try
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and
because
the
state
court
has
construed
a
federal
statute,
we
should
now
decide
whether
they
construed
it
correctly?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
finality
that
you
rely
on,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
robinson,
do
you
have
any
position
as
to
whether
this
is
a
final
judgment
within
28
u.s.c.
1257?
unknown
speaker
neither
of
those
were
from
state
courts,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
and
we
don't
require
finality
when
you're
reviewing
a
judgment
of
a
federal
court
of
appeals.
1257
just
applies
to
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
a
state.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so,
but
there
are
thousands
of
cases
that
we
have
denied
relief
on
when
there's
been
no
question
but
that
what
a
federal
question
has
been
finally
decided
in
the
state
court,
but
there
are
further
proceedings
still
to
come.
if
that
federal
question
can
be
said
to
survive
or
might
be
said...
if
it's
possible
that
that
federal
question
would
disappear
in
the
process
of
the
remand,
no
one
has
ever
held
that
that
is
final.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
may
lose.
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may--
--if
you
lose
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
lose
on
the
merits
under
instructions
from
the
trial
judge
to
the
jury
which
are
consistent
with
the
present
supreme
court
of
colorado
opinion,
how
would
you
get
here?
unknown
speaker
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
correct
instructions...
that
is,
instructions
consistent
with
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion...
we're
given.
well,
they're
surely
going
to
instruct
separately
on
the
decedent's
own
rights
and
the
children's
own
rights,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
mr.
robinson,
do
you
think
you're
entitled
to
win
on
both
points?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
don't
think
it's
possible
you'll
win
on
one?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
don't
think...
where
do
you
get
the
right
to
have
it
done
the
way
you
want
it
done?
you
don't
have
a
right
to
win.
unknown
speaker
well,
most
lawyers
i've
known
are
willing
to
win
a
case
on
any
ground
they
can.
you're
different,
then,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
still
true,
isn't
it,
that
the
jury
might
find
that
the
police
acted
in
self-defense
and
there's
no
liability
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
wouldn't
be
back.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
going
to
appeal
to
us
on
a
fact
question
of
liability.
unknown
speaker
so
this
case
clearly
is
not
final.
the
judgment
now
is
clearly
not
final.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
don't
have
jurisdiction,
no
matter
how
much
we
might
like
to,
we
really
don't
have
the
power
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
that's
another
federal
case.
unknown
speaker
that
came
from
the
first
circuit.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
isn't
a
question
of
mootness.
this
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction,
of
appellate
jurisdiction
under
the
statute.
we
need
to
have
a
final
judgment
from
a
state
court.
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
a
case
called
cox
broadcasting
company?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
in
any
other
context?
unknown
speaker
but
that
dealt
with
a
question
of
final
judgments
from
state
courts.
when
a
federal
question
has
been
finally
decided
in
a
state
court,
but
there
are
still
proceedings
still
to
come,
that
case
dealt
with
when
is
that
federal
question...
when
do
we
have
jurisdiction
over
that
federal
question
prior
to
finishing
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
and
as
i
understand
that
opinion,
this
case
doesn't
fit
in
any
of
the
situations
where
we
said
the
case
is
reviewable
at
this
stage.
but
you're
not
familiar
with
that
case?
unknown
speaker
if
you
win,
if
you
go
to
trial
now,
if
there
had
been
no
effort
to
bring
the
case
here
and
you
prevail
on
everything
and
on
all
the
theories
that
you
advance,
then
where
is
the
finality
of
the
present
judgment?
unknown
speaker
of
course
not.
but--
unknown
speaker
--he
might.
your
friend
might
have
some
question
about
the
applicability
of
the
federal
statute
in
this
case.
but
until
then,
where
is
the
case?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
i
don't
blame
you
for
this
final
judgment
business.
we
just
granted
certiorari.
you
would
have
thought
that
we
thought
we
had
jurisdiction.
i
don't
blame
you
for
not
being
prepared
to...
maybe
we
should
have
thought
about
it
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
five
of
us
agreed
with
you.
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
you
think
the
issue
is
important
and
your
opponent
thinks
it's
profound
together
does
not
give
us
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
give
us
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
while
you're
up
there
again
on
the
state
wrongful
death
action,
i
thought
there
was
some
recovery.
isn't
there
a
pecuniary
loss
recovery?
unknown
speaker
oh,
so
there
is
some
damage
recovery?
unknown
speaker
so
your
disagreement
with
the
state
remedy
is
that
it
does
not
allow
sufficient
damages?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that...
say
there
were
a
shoot-out
between
a
police
officer
with
six
children
and
mr.
espinoza
and
each
of
them
was
killed,
and
so
the
respective
families
sued
each
other...
that
the
family
of
the
police
officer
could
have
the
lesser
recovery,
but
the
family
of
the
civilian
would
get
greater
recovery?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
it
should
be
a
greater
recovery
than
if
it
were
from
unofficial
lawlessness?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
does
it
deprive
all
death
action
plaintiffs
of
the
fair
value?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
asking
for
a
discriminatory
construction
in
effect,
because
you're
asking
for
your
clients
to
get
more
than
they
can
get
under...
than
they
could
get
if
they
were
suing
someone
other
than
a
police
officer.
unknown
speaker
mr.
robinson,
i
gather
your
argument
is
it's
federal
law,
right,
that
we
ought
to
bar,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
state
law
limitation?
unknown
speaker
did
i
correctly
understand?
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
we
could
follow
the
state
law
limitations,
could
we
not?
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
my
question.
could
we
not
follow
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
robinson,
do
you
think
that
a
state
court
1983
action
must
inevitably
apply
all
the
substantive
and
procedural
rules
that
a
federal
court
1983
action
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
how
about
procedural
rules?
unknown
speaker
yes.
the
critical
question
i
suppose
is
what's
procedural
and
what's
substantive,
but
no
use
debating
that
here.
unknown
speaker
it
was
only
a
dissent.
they
don't
help
too
much.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
this
supreme
court
decision
in
colorado
if
that
theory
stands
up
you're
not
going
to
be
deprived
of
very
much,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there's
no
question
that
you
can
try
this
case
out
on
the
survivorship
theory.
you're
going
to
do
that
too,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
claim
of
the
decedent
himself
for
wrongful
death?
does
that
claim
survive
to
the
benefit
of
the
estate
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
what?
unknown
speaker
the
fundamental
claim
is...
isn't
it
a
1983
claim
also?
the
decedent's
claim
is
a
1983
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
so
he
wouldn't
be
limited
by
state
law
if
it
were
contrary
to
federal
policy.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
nevertheless
is
a
federal...
that's
a
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
they'll
all
survive.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
if
the
trial
court
says,
oh,
yes,
the
supreme
court
has
settled
that,
you
are
barred,
limited
rather,
and
you
get
that
limited
recovery,
what
you're
telling
us,
you'll
be
back
here
again?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
isn't
the
limitation
$45,000?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
you
ought
to
get...
at
least
the
jury
ought
to
be
able
to
give
you
more?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
if
you
end
up
with
$45,000
you'll
not
be
happy
with
that.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
how
can
we
upset
that?
how
can
we
upset
the
$45,000
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
going
to
give,
exemplary
damages
or
something?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
get
exemplary
damages
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
i
have
very
great
problems
with
dicta.
unknown
speaker
i
doubt
it's
dicta
if
it's
justice
powell.
he
doesn't
write
dicta.
unknown
speaker
he
used
the
words
"exemplary
damages"?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
i
didn't
remember
exemplary,
though.
unknown
speaker
you
said
exemplary.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
based
on
you
language.
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
you
were
going
to
give
me
your
answer,
instead
of
mr.
justice
powell's
answer.
now
may
i
have
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
not
under
1983,
or
are
they
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
you
have
punitive
damages
under
1983?
well,
certainly
the
statute
doesn't
say
so.
unknown
speaker
what
case
says
so?
unknown
speaker
i
never
said
it.
unknown
speaker
did
you
allege
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
that's
before
us.
it
wasn't
discussed
at
all.
unknown
speaker
that
statute
goes
as
high
as
$100,000,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
colorado
had
no
wrongful
death
statute?
unknown
speaker
we'd
write
one
for
them.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
you
might
want
us
to
write
one
anyhow.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
just
the
killings.
it
was
also
such
laws
as
one
in
maryland
which
prevented
negro
from
flying
a
kite.
it
covered
the
whole
panoply.
it
wasn't
restricted
to
death.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
one,
mr.
robinson?
unknown
speaker
you
rely
on
the
parent-child
relationship
as
creating
the
liberty
interest.
does
it
matter
whether
actually
there
is
a
parent?
suppose
there
were
a
grandparent
or
an
aunt
or
a
guardian
or
a
neighbor
or
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
who
was
in
the
care
of
its
mother.
how
far
would
this
go?
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
any
principled
way
of
limiting
the
relationship
to
the
parent-child
relationship?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
a
grandmother
involved
in
moore?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
would
limit
it
to
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
include...
say
a
young
father
is
in
prison
without
due
process
of
law
and
kept
in
jail
for
ten
years
and
then
is
let
out
because
he
was
wrongfully
imprisoned.
would
the
child
have
this
kind
of
claim?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
between
the
two
in
terms
of
some
kind
of
principle?
unknown
speaker
no
death
in
stanley.
