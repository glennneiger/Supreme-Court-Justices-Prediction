mr.
scott
h.
robinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
before
it
in
a
1983
context
a
state
statute
which
basically
makes
it
more
profitable
for
police
officers
to
kill
than
to
wound.
it's
an
unusual
statute.
it's
a
four-part
survival
and
wrongful
death
statute,
and
three
parts
of
it
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
to
this
court.
there's
an
additional
portion
which
is
cited
to
the
court
in
both
briefs,
but
which
was
left
out,
i
think
through
inadvertence,
and
that's
the
first
part
of
what
we
call
the
survivorship
claim.
but
when
you
read
these
four
statutes
you'll
see
that
they're
very
complicated,
they're
very
confusing.
basically,
colorado
law
on
the
subject
of
wrongful
death
and
on
the
subject
of
survivorship
is
that
very
little
survives,
and
as
regards
wrongful
death
damages
are
limited
to
$45,000
unless
a
dependent,
mother
or
father,
child
or
spouse,
is
left
living.
there's
also
what
we
call
the
net
pecuniary
loss
rule,
which
translated
means
you're
only
worth
what
you
can
earn.
that's
the
statute...
those
are
the
statutes
which
are
before
this
court.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
yes,
i
do,
justice
rehnquist.
i
have
actually
several
positions.
i'm
ambivalent
because
obviously
i
would
not
want
to
try
the
case
under
one
set
of
rules,
lose,
and
then
be
forced
to
come
back
to
this
court,
or
in
the
alternative
win
below
in
the
trial
court
and
have
a
later
judgment
on
the
associational
rights
thrown
out
the
window.
i
don't
want
that
to
happen.
i
think
the
court
has
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
for
example,
i
would
cite
to
the
court
two
recent
decisions,
green
versus
carlson
and
percunier
versus
navarette.
in
both
those
cases
the
district
court
dismissed,
one
on
a
summary
judgment
ground--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
those
are
federal
court
questions.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
understand.
but
the
principle
is
there,
your
honor,
that
when
a
court
below
has
dismissed
and
the
appellate
court
then
reaffirms...
reestablishes
the
complaint,
you
then
have
a
final
judgment
at
least
as
to
legal
questions.
and
that's
something
that
i
think
the
amicus
brief
overlooks.
the
legal
question
is
postured
for
review
in
this
court.
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
hear
it--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--i
agree
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor.
the
problem
here--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--then
we'll
be
back
here,
your
honor,
because
one
of
our
grounds--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--we
may
very
well
be,
and
that's
a
problem.
and
i
want
to
cite
to
the
court
very
clearly
that
portion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion
which
puts
us
all
in
a
quandary.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
we
won't
know,
because
of
the
way
they
structured
their
opinion,
whether
or
not
we
were
denied
relief
because
of
the
associational
claims
or
because
of
the
survivorship
claims,
and
that's--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--but
the
way
the
opinion
is
structured,
justice
white,
is
this:
they
have
held
very
clearly
that
there
are
associational
rights
for
which
damages
are
recoverable,
and
also
that
the
wrongful
death
and
survivorship
statutes
are
inconsistent
with
the
federal
remedy.
then
they
pass
on
to
the
second
issue,
the
issue
of
survivorship,
and
what
they
held
was
that
because
we've
given
the
survivors
this
other
remedy
we
do
not
need
to
determine
whether
the
estate
has
a
claim.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
do.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
i
don't
mean
to
sound
greedy,
your
honor.
but
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
we
have
two
claims--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--your
honor,
i
represent
two
separate
classes
of
claimants.
one
class
of
claimants
in
this
case
are
the
children.
another
class
of
claimants
are
the
heirs
to
the
estate,
who
really
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
decedent.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
that's
true,
i'll
win
on
any
grounds,
your
honor,
i
can.
but
i
do
represent
two
separate
classes,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
anything's
possible--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--it's
not
going
to
change
the
legal--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
the
judgment
is
certainly
final
on
the
question
of
the
legal
questions.
and
again,
if
i
could
cite
the
court
justice
blackmun's
opinion
in
fact
concerts,
as
was
the
instruction
issued
there,
this
is
an
important
issue,
and
more
importantly,
it's
likely
to
recur.
i
just
point
out
again
jones
versus
hildebrant.
this
court
per
curiam
sent
back
the
case
as
improvidently
granted.
here
we
are
again;
very
similar
issue,
just
a
few
years
later.
the
question
was
raised
in
jones.
it's
raised
more
squarely
here.
and
i
think
maybe
it's
time
for
the
court
to
act.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
again,
i'm
just
reading
justice
blackmun's
opinion
in
fact
concerts.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
footnote
6--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--the
principle
is
the
same.
if
it's
an
issue
that's
likely
to
recur,
this
court
doe
stand
in
that
regard
as
the
final
tribunal
of
the
country.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
i
guess
my
position
is
i
fail
to
see
or
understand
how
a
factual
determination
in
this
particular
case
changes
in
any
iota
the
jurisdictional
power
of
the
court.
maybe
i
am
to
unaware
of
the
federal
statue
to
give
you
a
passable
argument
to
assist
you
in
that
respect.
i
feel
that
this
case
is
ripe
for
review,
which
is
why
we
join--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--versus
cohn?
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
not
in
this
context.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
i'm
not
familiar
with
it
in
this
context.
it's
a
case--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--perhaps.
at
least
i
remembered
the
name,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
no,
i
can't
assist
the
court.
i'm
sorry,
i
really
am.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
obviously
if
we
prevail
on
all
theories
we
won't
be
asking
this
court
for--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--i
think
maybe
our
adversaries--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--all
i
can
do
is
repeat
that
which
i've
said.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
actually,
justice
white,
i
joined
in
the
request
that
the
court
take
cent
as
well.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
and
that's
basically
because
both
i
and
our
clients
felt
that
this
was
an
important
issue
which
needed
final
resolution.
and
certainly
we
are
aware
that--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--well,
we're
risking
a
lot
by
taking
the
case
up
at
this
point.
my
clients
were
aware
of
that.
but
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
the
issue
is
obviously
going
to
recur
at
some
point,
and
that's
why
we
feel
that
it's
ripe
at
this
time.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--i'm
hoping
maybe
we
can
convince
you
that
it's
both
profound
and
important,
justice
marshall.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
think
the
real
issue
here
and
one
of
the
problems
we've
had
from
the
start,
once
the
colorado
supreme
court
entered
its
decision,
was
again
this
bifurcation
of
the
associational
interests
and
the
survivorship
interests.
that's
what
caused
me
great
concern.
when
i
responded
to
the
petition,
in
my
response
i
did
indeed
bring
in
the
survivorship
statute,
the
question
of
inconsistency.
in
the
reply
brief
it
has
been
intimated
that
perhaps
the
respondent
did
not
raise
these
questions.
but
they
were
fairly
presented
to
the
court
in
the
response,
and
then
of
course
the
court
granted
cert.--
the
questions
before
this
court,
some
of
them
are
very
novel,
some
of
them
are
fairly
well
established.
and
if
the
court
does
accept
the
case
for
review
the
court
will
need
to
determine
what
happens
in
the
1983
context
when
the
act
causes
death.
this
is
obviously
not
the
robertson
versus
wegmann
situation,
because
there
it's
a
question
of
abatement.
the
wrongful
act
did
not
cause
the
death.
this
case
differs
substantially.
this
is
indeed
the
case
presaged
by
justice
marshall
in
that
case,
and
this
is
that
other
case,
a
case
where
the
constitutional
deprivation
resulted
in
death.
several
lower
courts
have
held
that
parents
have
rights
in
their
children
in
the
1983
context.
we
have
cited
several
of
these
in
our
brief.
they
include
the
smith
versus
wickline,
the
beard
versus
robinson
case.
also,
of
course,
there's
this
court's
own
opinion
in
carlson,
green
versus
carlson,
which
certainly
stands
for
the
proposition
that
federal
law
may
in
certain
circumstances
require
a
uniform
rule
of
survivorship.
now,
this
court
first,
then,
needs
to
determine,
if
again
it
accepts
or
continues
to
accept
jurisdiction,
whether
the
appropriate
remedies
lie
with
both
the
children
or
with
the
estate
or
both.
obviously,
our
position
is
that
the
decedent
suffered
the
greatest
injury
of
all.
the
decedent
was
killed.
colorado
law
offers
nothing,
literally
nothing,
to
the
survivors
under
those
circumstances,
under
what
is
normally
called
our
wrongful
death
act.
in
other
words,
an
81-year-old
man
who
is
unemployed,
a
14-year-old
son
who
is
unemployed,
or
for
that
matter
a
35-year-old
man
who's
unemployed,
has
no
real
value
to
his
family
in
colorado.
now,
this
is
a
state
law
question
as
regards
wrongful
death.
but
when
the
1983
claim
is
filed
it
becomes--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--net
pecuniary
loss.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
yes.
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
a
particular
young
man--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--that's
correct.
your
honor.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
that's
correct,
because
again
this
was
the
whole
purpose
of
passage
of
the
civil
right
act
in
1971,
was
to
prevent
officer
state
lawlessness,
because,
the
theory
goes...
and
it's
a
true
one...
the
state
has
all
of
the
power
of
the
state
at
its
disposal.
and
obviously
section
1
of
the
1871
act
was
designed
both
to
deter
and
compensate.
you
so
stated
in--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--the
problem
at
that
point
in
time,
your
honor,
was
a
simple
one.
there
was
no
state
recovery.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
the
statute
was
designed
not
only
for
inadequate
laws,
of
which
there
were
many
at
the
time,
including
the
black
codes,
but
also
the
ineffective
enforcement.
but
in
colorado
i
would
submit
that
our
present
day
statute,
although
it
differs
in
terms
of
its
lack
of
racial
stigma,
nonetheless
completely
deprives
a
1983
action
of
its
compensatory
value.
net
pecuniary--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--the
issue
is
not
whether
or
not
it
discriminates
intentionally
on
its
face.
this
court
has
made
that
clear
in
moore--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--it's
a
matter
of
federal
law,
your
honor.
this
court
has
to
implement
what
was
congress'
intent.
and
whether
the
colorado
legislature
still
thinks
people's
lives
are
worth
$45,000
or
less
or
not
certainly
should
not
bind
a
federal
court
in
applying
the
1983
action.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
section
1988--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--i
think
that's
correct.
in
fact,
my
reading
of
the
petitioner's
position
is
that--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--you
certainly
look
to
them
under
section
1988.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
if
the
court
ruled
that
it
was
conducive
to
the
federal
policy,
certainly.
that's
the
teaching
of
moore.
that's
the
teaching
of
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park.
you
formulate
the
rule
which
is
responsive
to
the
federal
need.
so
obviously,
if
state
law
is
not
inconsistent
with,
did
not
hinder
federal
recovery,
certainly
we
would
borrow
state
statutes.
the
timaneo
case
with
the
tolling
statute...
maybe
that's
not
the
greatest
analogy.
robertson
versus
wegmann.
but
in
any
event,
certainly
it's
possible.
what
you
have
to
do,
though,
is
analyze
the
state
statute.
and
of
course
this
state
statute
offers
nothing,
literally
nothing.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
if
i
could
break
your
question
down,
i
think,
yes,
they
have
to
apply
all
substantive
rules.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
think
then
if
it's
a
mere
matter
of
procedure
they
can
go
ahead
and
use
their
own
state
procedures.
for
example,
one
of
the
reasons
we
filed
the
case
in
state
court
is
that
in
colorado
the
jurors
are
selected
by
voir
dire
of
the
counsel
as
well
as
the
judge.
we
feel
this
gives
us
more
rapport
with
the
juries,
whereas
in
federal
court
the
judge
does
all
the
questioning
and
it's
a
little
colder
and
more
distant.
and
we
feel
that
that's
appropriate
for
the
state
courts
to
use
the
procedural
rules.
and
obviously,
we're
not
going
to
clog
up
the
federal
judiciary
of
we
can
do
what
we
think
is
in
the
strategic
interest
of
our
clients.
does
that
answer
the
court's
question?
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
there
are
times
when
that
gets
beyond
the
ken.
the
point
i'd
like
to
leave
the
court
with
with
regard
to
the
colorado
supreme
court's
ruling
is
that
it
is
based
on
various
decisions
of
this
court.
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
the
jones
versus
hildebrant
dissent--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--well,
since
he's
from
colorado
his
dissents
bear
more
weight.
[laughter]
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
dissent,
these
are
questions
this
court
has
never
addressed
and
they
are
recurring.
they're
recurring
daily.
there'll
be
plenty
more
filings
with
a
new
theory
in
colorado
and
hopefully
some
other
states.
an
whether
the
court
avoids
the
issue
on
this
or
not,
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
this
court
is
going
to
get
faced
with
a
question
of
state
law
which
severely
restricts
recovery
in
the
1983
context
when
death
occurs.
this
is
simply
a
result
of
some
failure
of
legislatures
around
the
country
to
be
enlightened
as
to
the
value
of
human
life.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
maybe
for
three
or
four
years,
until
such
other
time
as
a
case
this
court
deems
appropriately
postured
comes
up.
it's
just
not
a
prospect
i
particularly
like,
because
it
leaves
us
in
a
state
of
limbo.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
the
problem
is...
this
is
why
we're
in
a
quandary,
because
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
well,
now
that
we've
given
you
all
you
wanted
over
here
in
the
associational
rights,
you're
stuck
with
state
law
on
the
survivorship
rights.
and
i
don't
know--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--yes,
but.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
because
we
gave
you
these
associational
rights,
that
survivorship
claim
for
the
death
of
the
decedent
is
limited
by
the
$45,000
rule,
the
net
pecuniary
loss
rule,
and,
which
hasn't
been
mentioned,
the
ban
on
exemplary
damages.
so
to
me
it
seems
like
the
biggest--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--that's
correct,
they're
both
1983
claims.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
that's
not
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
opined.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
so
is
the
question
of
associational
rights.
and
on
the
one
hand
they
told
us--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--well,
that's
certainly
our
hope.
and
obviously,
if
the
case
goes
back
in
its
present
posture,
i'll
attempt
to
convince
the
trial
court
that
it
should
also
not
bar
our
recovery
under
the
survivorship
statute.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
hopefully
we'll
have
such
a
substantial
recovery
that
we
won't
be.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
that's
correct.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
actually,
more
important
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--yes.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
it's
a
net
pecuniary
loss
question
more
than
the
limit.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
the
problem
is
that
arthur
espinoza,
though
this
is
not
in
the
record,
was
not
contributing
to
his
children.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
the
same
way
this
court
in
green
versus
carlson
disregarded
for
federal
law
purposes
indiana's
survivorship
laws.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
that's
true
too,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
would
cite
to
the
court
dicta,
since
this
court
has
never--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--well,
it's
justice
powell's
dicta.
does
that
make
it
any
better?
[laughter]
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
okay.
in
carey
versus
piphus,
in
owen,
there
certainly
have
been
plenty
of
indications
by
this
court
that
exemplary
damages
are
recoverable
in
appropriate
cases.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
or
punitive.
to
my
knowledge--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--all
right.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
maybe
i'm--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--i
see.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
as
far
as
i
know,
exemplary
damages
and
punitive
damages
are
one
and
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
it's
my
understanding,
whether
it's
a
long-term
ignorance
or
just
a
temporary
insanity,
that
i
always
thought
that
they
were
exactly
the
same,
that
it
was
a
matter
of
mere
semantics,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
that's
correct.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
again
i'm
drawing
from
carey
versus
piphus,
owen
versus
city
of
independence.
this
court
has...
i'm
trying
to
remember
if
you
said
so
in
robertson
versus
wegmann.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
can't
recall.
there
certainly
have
been
stirrings,
if
not
outright
holdings
that
punitive
damages
are
recoverable.
and
it's
always
been
in
the
context
of
an
appropriate
case.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
yes,
we
did,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
that
was
one
of
the
three
areas
of
colorado
law
which
we
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
felt
were
inconsistent.
we
have
the
exemplary
damages
or
punitive
damages
question,
the
net
pecuniary
loss
rule
question,
and
the
$45,000
ceiling
question.
those
three
aspects
of
colorado
law
are
those
elements
that
at
the
beginning
of
my
presentation
i
stated
i
felt
gave
an
incentive
to
law
enforcement
officers
to
kill
rather
than
main,
because
by
so
doing
they
limit
their
liability
extensively.
and
there's
also
an
indemnification
statute,
incidentally,
if
the
recovery
was
$45,000,
which
would
ensure
that
the
officer
involved
never
had
a
penny
come
out
of
his
pocket.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
that's
correct.
so
the
gut
reaction,
the
final
result
of
all
of
this,
is
that
a
police
officer
in
colorado
kills
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
secured
by
section
1983,
or
at
least
the
civil
right
is
secured,
then
winds
up
out
of
pocket
not
at
all,
no
exemplary
or
punitive
damages.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
think
this
court
would
find
as
a
matter
of
federal
law--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--that's
correct,
because--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--well,
justice
marshall,
in
1871
when
the
ku
klux
klan
act
was
passed,
of
which
this
is
section
1,
there
were
no
wrongful
death
statutes,
and
yet
the
legislative
history
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
makes
clear
that
it
was
the
murders,
the
killings,
the
lynchings,
that
impressed
upon
congress
and
upon
president
grant,
who
want
before
congress--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--i
agree
it
wasn't
restricted
to
death,
your
honor.
but
certainly
several
congresspersons
did
respond
to
the
problem
of
murders
in
their
various
jurisdictions.
do
any
other
members
of
the
court
have
any
questions?
thank
you--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--certainly,
justice
powell.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
under
the
facts
of
the
case
we're
asking
the
court
simply
to
decide
it
on
the
question
of
a
parent
being
taken
from
the
children.
i
think
the
court--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--certainly,
your
honor.
i
have
no
problem
with
it.
this
court
has--
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
--this
court
has
delineated
many
times
under
its
various
rulings,
such
as
stanley,
as
opposed
to
quillon,
that
the
subtle
differences
in
societal
relationships
can
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
determining
legal
relationships.
we
can
look,
as
justice
burger
pointed
out
in
wisconsin
versus
yoder,
we
can
look
at
our
history
of
western
civilization
and
recount
many,
many
instances
in
literature
and
the
like
of
parent-child
relationships.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
in
moore?
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
thought
hamlet
was
kind
of
based
on
father-son,
just
to
give
the
court
one
example.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
parent-child
relationship
is
the
most
sacred
family
relationship
of
all.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
yes,
i
would.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
no.
i
think
that
floodgate
theory
is
an
erroneous
one.
just
because
we
recognize
the
theory
when
death
irrevocably
cuts
off
the
relationship
does
not
mean
that
we're
going
to
extend
it
to
the
ends
of
the
earth.
and
i
think
that
one
point
illustrates
it.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
well,
we
can
look
first
to
legislative
history
and
the
intent
of
congress
to
have
a
civil
claim
arise
when
someone
is
killed.
certainly
somebody's
got
to
carry
the
ball.
secondly,
i
think
this
court's
decisions
in
stanley,
for
example,
they're
premised
totally
on
that
relationship.
mr.
scott
h.
robinson
i
realize
that,
but
they're
premised
on
a
specific,
specific
factual
basis.
and
if
there's
one
interest...
and
this
is
the
point
i
made
in
the
brief,
i
hope...
if
there's
one
interest
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
sacred
one,
it's
the
interest
not
to
have
one's
parents
murdered
by
state
action.
and
that's
what
i
feel
this
court
can
in
a
principled
manner
distinguish
this
from
wrongful
imprisonment.
thank
you.
