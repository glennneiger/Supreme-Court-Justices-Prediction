mr.
russ
r.
mueller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
a
brief
summary
of
what
has
been
said.
the
issue
is
simple.
it
is
determining
the
legal
standard
that
should
be
applied
to
the
confidential
exclusion
of
employees
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board's
position
is
that
the
labor
nexus
test
should
apply,
namely,
whether
the
employee
is
in
a
confidential
work
relationship
with
a
specifically
identifiable
managerial
employee
responsible
for
labor
relations
policy.
the
lower
court
in
the
hendricks
case
rejected
that
labor
nexus
test
and
applied
their
decision
in
the
hendricks
case
to
the
malleable
case.
this
controversy
is
going
to
be
resolved
by
this
court
by
the
interpretation
given
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendments
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
court
dealt
with
that
history,
legislative
history
in
the
bell
aerospace
case.
namely,
in
footnote
12,
the
court
said,
in
effect,
the
discussion
of
confidential
employees
in
both
the
house
and
conference
reports
unmistakably
refers
to
that
term
defined
in
the
house
bill,
which
was
not
limited
just
to
those
in
labor
relations.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
it
is
dictum
to
the
court's
decision,
but
very
fundamentally
significant
to
the
decision
in
that
it
is
an
underpinning
of
the
conclusion
the
court
made
as
to
the
managerial
implied
exclusion
of
employees,
and
to--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--i
would
say
that
one
might
be
able
to
reach
that
conclusion;
however,
after
footnote
12,
the
court,
the
court
emphasized
that
therefore,
since
confidential
employees
are
impliedly
excluded
from
the
act,
obviously
managerial
employees
are
paramount
to
them
and
they
therefore
should
also
be
excluded.
the
definition
of
confidential
employees
as
defined
in
the
house
bill
was
"those
employees
given
information
of
a
confidential
nature
for
use
in
the
interests
of
the
employer,
which
is
not
available
to
the
public,
not
available
to
competitors,
or
not
available
to
employees
generally.
"
we
believe
that
is
the
standard
that
should
be
applied
to
this
confidential
exclusion.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
based
on
footnote
12.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
i
endorse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
hendricks
case,
namely,
that
if
the
substance
of
footnote
12
is
going
to
be
changed,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
change
it.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
because
of
what
this
court
stated
in
footnote
12.
namely--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--well,
i
will--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--not
the
house
bill.
but
i
will--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--well,
then
a
conference
report
made
a
compromise.
a
conference
report
made
a
compromise
between
the
difference
between
the
senate
and
the
house
bill.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
no,
i
cannot
agree
that
it
eliminated
it.
i
agree
with
what
is
stated
in
footnote
12,
that
they
deferred
to
the
definition
of
pre-1947
decisions
were
in
this
area.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
you
mean
footnote
12
or
the
conference
report?
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
i
will
concede
that
if
the
substance
of
footnote
12
as
it
reads
on
its
face
is
changed
by
this
court,
that
at
least
to
the
extent
that
malleable
is
concerned,
we
lose,
because
the
underpinnings
of
our
position
is
footnote
12,
because
in
malleable,
the
confidential
employee
claim
rests
on
non-labor
relations
information,
such
as
prices,
profit
margins,
costs,
customer
information,
the
type
of
information
that
unions
in
labor
contract
negotiations
would
be
very
much
interested
in.
however,
just
because
a
union
is
a
collective
bargaining
agent
does
not
entitle
them
to
that
information.
the
prevailing
law
is
that
they
only
have
that
information
if
the
employer
voluntarily
gives
it
to
them
in
contract
negotiations,
or
if
the
employer
makes
a
plea
of
poverty,
and
then
even
when
the
employer
makes
a
plea
of
poverty
in
negotiations,
then
the
right
to
search
financial
records
of
the
employer
need
be
restricted
by
the
employer
to
the
extent
of
requiring
the
search
to
be
done
by
a
cpa
accountant.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
i
would
say
that,
without
referring
to
a
particular
case
but
just
generalizing,
that
under
the
present
board
law,
no,
they
would
not
be.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
the
board
hasn't
been
entirely
consistent
in
this
regard,
because
even
under
their
presently
professed
consistent
standard,
they
do
make
variations
in
this
area
when
the
information
gets
particularly
sensitive.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
the
board
shows
evidence
of
taking
into
consideration
these
areas
of
sensitivity.
they
talk
then
in
terms
of
alignment
with
management.
the
board
hasn't
been,
contrary
to
their
assertion,
hasn't
been
entirely
consistent
through
the
years
in
the--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
the--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--we
have
to
look
at
the
type
of
confidential
information
they
have.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
that
is
not
available
to
the
public,
to
competitors,
or
to
employees
generally.
and
it
has
to
be
used
in
the
interests
of
the
employer
if
it
meets
that
test,
yes,
but
that
doesn't
exclude,
for
instance,
if
we
go
to
the
general
dynamics
case,
where
they
had
some
1,600
engineers,
that
wouldn't
exclude
junior
engineers,
senior
engineers--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--well,
but
you
could
also
have
a
professional
with
access
to
confidential
information
who
would
be
excluded
as
confidential,
which
leads
me
to
point
out
that
the
representation
of
malleable
as
including
an
array
of
confidential
exclusions
isn't
quite
accurate,
because
most
of
those,
in
fact
the
vast
majority
of
those
claims
are
also
claimed
to
be
managerial
exclusions
under
bell
aerospace,
and
the
fact
that
they
have
confidential
information
is
used,
in
regard
to
the
managerial
contention,
is
used
to
show
their
alignment
with
management
as
a
managerial
exclusion.
the
same
could
apply
to
treatment
of
a
professional
employee.
the
point
is
that
the
prevailing
law
relative
to
unions
not
having
access
to
this
type
of
financial
information,
profits,
costs,
capital
and
expense
budgets,
unless
there
is
a
plea
of
poverty,
the
point
is
that
that
prevailing
law
should
not
be
diluted
by
adopting
the
narrow
standard
of
the
labor
nexus,
because
obviously
the
effect
of
that
is,
if
you
have
an
employee
represented
by
the
union
who
has
access
to
this
sensitive
financial
data,
the
information
could
very
well
find
its
way
to
the
union,
contrary
to
the
union's
inability
to
get
it
unless
the
employer
would
voluntarily
choose
to
share
it
with
the
union
in
contract
negotiations,
or
unless
they
make
a
plea
of
bargaining.
management
is
entitled
to
the
security
of
that
type
of
financial
information,
and
also
the
loyalty
of
the
employees
who
have
access
to
it,
and
therefore,
as
confidential
employees,
they
should
be
excluded
from
the
protection
of
the
entire
act,
not
just
the
collective
bargaining
aspects
of
it.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
yes,
and
i
believe,
if
memory
serves
me
correctly,
the
board
and
the
amicus
briefs
of
the
unions
make
that
point
to
the
court.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
the
burden
should
not
be
placed
upon
the
employer
to
police
this
area,
when
the
law
should
be
the
area
that
takes
care
of
that
situation.
for
instance,
the
consideration
in
terms
of
discharge,
particularly
when
you
are
dealing
with
confidential
employees,
or
let's
say
management
employees,
you
have
an
investment
in
those
employees.
they
have
something
to
contribute
that
is
substantially
more
to
the
ongoing
management
function.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
if
indeed
this
court
should
adopt
a
standard
for
determining
confidential
employees
which
allows
employees
with
access
to
that
type
of
sensitive
financial
information
to
be
part
of
the
bargaining
unit,
yes,
then
the
employer
will
have
to--
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
--except
i
believe
that
begs
the
question.
mr.
russ
r.
mueller
except
that
we
then
get
back
to
the
factor
of
loyalty.
if
he
is
outside
the
bargaining
unit,
the
loyalty
is
more
plain
and
apparent
to
all
concerned,
and
if
he
is
in
the
bargaining
unit,
then
you
don't
even
have
the
psychological
alignment.
you
have
alignment.
you
have
the
split
personality.
you
have
the
split
loyalty.
