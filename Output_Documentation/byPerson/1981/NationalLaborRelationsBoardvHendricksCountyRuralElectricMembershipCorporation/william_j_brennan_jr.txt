justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
two
cases,
the
first
as
the
chief
justice
said,
national
labor
relations
board
versus
hendricks
county
rural
electric
membership
corporation
and
its
companion,
national
labor
relations
board
versus
malleable
iron
range
company
are
also
here
on
certiorari
from
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
refused
to
enforce
orders
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
holding
the
respondent
employers
in
these
two
cases
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
first
case,
the
hendricks
case,
the
board
found
that
hendricks
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
the
discharge
of
the
personal
secretary
of
the
companyâ€™s
general
manager,
discharged
because
she
had
signed
a
petition
seeking
reinstatement
of
a
dismissed
fellow
employee.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
enforce
that
order
holding
that
the
personal
secretary
was
a
confidential
employee,
not
protected
by
the
act
and
therefore
that
her
discharge
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
second
case,
the
malleable
iron
range
company
case,
the
board
found
that
malleable
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
its
refusal
to
bargain
with
the
unit
certified
by
the
board
which
unit
included
18
employees
regarded
by
malleable
as
confidential
employees.
the
board's
policy
for
some
40
years
had
been
to
include
confidential
employees
and
bargaining
units
except
when
such
employees
assist
and
act
in
a
confidential
capacity
to
superiors
who
formulate,
determine,
and
effectuate
management
policies
in
the
field
of
labor
relations
and
none
of
these
18
employees
served
in
that
capacity.
the
court
of
appeals
held
however
that
all
employees
working
in
a
confidential
capacity
without
regard
to
labor
relations
did
not
have
the
protection
of
the
act
and
therefore
that
malleable's
refusal
to
bargain
for
a
unit
including
the
18
employees
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
well
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
section
2(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
expressly
provides
that
the
term
employee
shall
include
any
employee
with
certain
stated
exceptions
that
do
not
include
confidential
employees.
indeed,
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
passed
in
1947,
the
house
of
representatives
made
an
effort
to
expand
the
exceptions
in
2(3)
to
include
confidential
employees
but
the
effort
failed
in
conference.
rather
the
conference
accepted
the
board's
construction
of
section
2(3)
that
confidential
employees
were
covered
by
the
act
which
should
not
be
certified
in
bargaining
units
if
they
assist
superiors
who
perform
labor
relations
responsibilities
for
the
employer.
this
is
therefore
we
think
particularly
a
case
for
application
of
the
kind
of
construction
that
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
by
the
agency
charged
with
its
execution
should
be
followed
unless
there
are
compelling
indications
that
it
is
wrong,
especially
whereas
here,
congress
acknowledged
the
board
policy
has
refused
to
order
the
administrative
construction.
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
both
cases
are
therefore
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
