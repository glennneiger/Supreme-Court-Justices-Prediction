mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
two
consolidated
cases
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
presenting
questions
concerning
the
scope
of
an
implied
exclusion
from
collective
bargaining
rights
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
nonmanagerial
employees
entrusted
by
their
employers
with
confidential
information.
the
cases
do
not
present
the
question
that
has
been
before
the
court
in
the
past
concerning
the
drawing
of
the
line
between
labor
and
management,
which
has
been
the
subject
of
much
past
controversy;
but
the
cases
are
instead
decided
on
the
premise
that
these
are
employees
who
fall
on
the
labor
rather
than
management
side
of
that
dividing
line.
there
is
a
contention
to
the
contrary
in
one
of
the
cases
that
has
not
yet
been
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
would
be
reached
on
remand
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
contentions.
one
of
the
cases,
the
malleable
case,
involves
an
assortment
of
18
employees,
and
it's
disputed
whether
they
should
be
included
within
the
bargaining
unit.
they're
described
in
some
detail
on
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief.
i
won't
recount
all
of
them
at
this
time.
you'll
notice
that
included
among
them
are
four
engineers,
three
draftsmen,
and
a
number
of
relatively
low
level
employees.
we
describe,
for
example,
one
who
earns
$3.50
an
hour
and
is
essentially
a
shipping
clerk
and
performs
such
tasks
as
routing
shipments,
preparing
bills
of
lading,
tracing
lost
deliveries,
and
handling
damage
claim
reports.
another
at
an
annual
salary
of
$10,500
handles
paperwork
relating
to
shipments
to
and
from
the
employer's
warehouses.
another
at
an
annual
salary
of
$6,400
handles
correspondence
and
telephone
calls
concerning
difficulties
with
the
company's
products
and
is
responsible
for
issuing
credits
on
defective
merchandise,
et
cetera.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
perhaps
so.
it
certainly
is
true
that
the
chamber
of
commerce,
which
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
against
us,
confined
its
brief
to
the
hendricks
case
and
did
not
take
a
position
with
respect
to
malleable.
i'm
mentioning
this
array
of
employees
to
give
some
indication
of
the
scope
of
the
court
of
appeals
holdings
here,
and
i'll
get
to
hendricks
in
just
a
moment.
but
what
i
want--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--not
on
the
facts
that
were
found
by
the
board
in
these
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may
just
say
one
further
word
about
the
employees
in
malleable,
then
i'll
talk
about
the
personal
secretary
who
was
involved
in
hendricks.
i
don't
think
the
word
"confidential"
secretary
is
the
right
word
there.
there
is
no
claim
in
malleable
that
any
of
the
employees
involved
had
access
to
confidential
information
relating
to
labor
relations
in
any
sense.
the
claim
is
that
they
were
entrusted
with
confidences
that
the
employer
did
not
want
its
potential
competitors
or
competitors
to
know,
or
in
some
instances
its
customers
to
know;
but
not
information
that
the
employer
would
be
concerned
about
a
union
or
fellow
employees
learning.
now,
hendricks
involved
only
one
employee
as
it
reaches
this
court,
a
personal
secretary
to
the
general
manager.
and
i
should
say
up
front
that
ordinarily
someone
in
that
position
would
be
found
by
the
board
to
have
the
labor
nexus
that
i'll
be
describing
in
a
moment;
but
the
board
is
a
very
fact-specific
agency.
it
made
findings
here.
it
goes
beyond
the
labels.
it
found
that
this
particular
general
manager
had
relatively
little
to
do
with
the
setting
of
labor
policies
in
this
small
rural
electric
cooperative.
by
and
large
those
matters
were
handled
by
the
counsel
for
the
cooperative
and
by
the
board
of
directors
themselves.
and
to
the
extent
the
general
counsel
was
involved,
the
secretary
simply
did
not
have
a
confidential
relationship
with
him
with
respect
to
those
matters.
she
did
not
learn
of
them.
she
did
not
have
access.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he's
definitely
a
manager.
he's
the
general
manager
of
the
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
bell
he
is
excluded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board...
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
we
don't
challenge
that
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
situation,
mr.
justice.
but
since
virtually
all
employees
work
for
the
general
management
of
the
company
and
people
who
are
managers,
that
in
itself
is
not
dispositive.
the
question
that
the
board
has
always
viewed
as
the
key
one
is
whether
there
is
access
to
confidential
information
that
is
labor
related,
and
the
board
has
never
treated
all
secretaries
to
any
managerial
people
as
necessarily
coming
within
the
board's
definition
of
confidential
employees,
although
many
of
them
do,
if
the
particular
manager
has
any
substantial
role
in
labor
relations
matters.
but
let
me
just
say
briefly
that
the
board
in
both
instances
found
that
its
labor
nexus
test
was
not
met,
and
therefore
rejected
the
claims
that
these
were
confidential
employees
as
the
board
has
developed
that
doctrine
as
an
implied
exception
to
the
bargaining
rights
under
the
act.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
both
instances
by
a
2
to
1
vote
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
orders
and
rejected
the
labor
nexus
aspect
of
the
board's
standard
in
reliance
upon
a
footnote
discussion
in
this
court's
bell
aerospace
opinion
of
several
years
ago.
now,
the
act
itself
contains
no
reference
of
any
kind
and
never
has
to
confidential
employees,
but
almost
from
the
outset
the
board
has
excluded
from
bargaining
units
as
a
matter
of
statutory
policy
employees
who
have
had
access
to
confidential
labor
relations
information.
there
has
been
an
evolution,
a
refinement
of
the
board's
views
on
this,
but
there
is
a
continuum
with
a
few
bumps
along
the
way
that
stretches
over
some
40
years.
and
these
cases
have
usually
arisen
in
just
the
way
the
malleable
case
has
arisen,
as
a
question
of
defining
who
is
to
be
included
in
a
bargaining
unit,
and
the
contention
between
the
board
and
the
employer
would
be
about
whether
the
employees
with
this
confidential
information
should
or
should
not
be
included.
and
it
has
always
been
developed
as
a
question
of
excepting
them
from
collective
bargaining
rights
rather
than
from
all
possible
protection
under
the
act's
broad
definition
of
employee.
and
another
peculiarity
of
the
hendricks
case
is
that
there
are
no
collective
bargaining
rights
involved,
no
union
membership
involved
of
any
kind,
but
an
exercise
of
another
kind
of
protected
activity,
the
signing
of
a
petition,
which
in
the
board's
view
is
a
protection
that
extends
to
confidential
employees
within
the
labor
nexus
definition.
in
other
words,
in
the
board's
view
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
the
secretary
in
the
hendricks
case
falls
within
the
labor
nexus
definition
or
not;
but
they
did
find
that
she
would
not,
that
she
did
not
have
access
to
confidential
labor
relations
information.
the
basis
for
the
board's
view
was
early
set
out,
and
we
have
quoted
on
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief
in
an
opinion
called
hoover
company
a
rationale
which
has
really
not
been
deviated
from
over
the
years,
that
even
though
the
act
did
not
contain
any
such
exclusion,
that
there
is
adversity
of
interest
between
the
union
and
management
in
collective
bargaining,
in
the
settling
of
grievances,
and
consequently
in
order
to
implement
the
statutory
policy
and
make
the
collective
bargaining
process
work,
the
board
concluded
that
management
should
not
be
required
to
handle
labor
relations
matters
through
employees
represented
by
unions
with
whom
the
company
has
to
deal
in
either
their
negotiations
for
collective
bargaining
or
in
the
disposition
of
grievances.
but
at
the
same
time
from
the
very
beginning
the
board
has
in
a
long
series
of
cases
held
that
access
to
other
kinds
of
confidential
information
and
the
entrusting
of
other
kinds
of
confidential
information
to
an
employee
is
not
a
reason
for
exclusion
from
the
full
protections
of
the
act.
we've
referred
to
this
on
pages
20
and
21
of
our
brief
as
the
creamery
package
doctrine.
that
was
one
of
the
earliest
cases
articulating
that
point
of
view.
it
was
an
even
earlier
case
than
the
hoover
case.
it
was
a
1941
decision.
and
we
have
collected
in
footnote
21
on
page
21
of
our
brief
some
of
the
many
pre-taft-hartley
cases
in
which
the
board
applied
this
principle
to
a
large
variety
of
employees
entrusted
with
confidential
information.
and
we
refer
on
pages
22
and
23
of
our
brief
to
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
upheld
this
principle,
both
well
before
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley.
the
one
we
quote
is
a
1945
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit,
and
on
page
23
we
refer
to
a
third
circuit
decision
of
1943
likewise
upholding
this
doctrine.
and
the
rationale
of
it
is
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
rights
of
self-organization
or
collective
bargaining
rights
that
are
conferred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
loyal
and
faithful
service
to
an
employer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it
probably
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
so
long
as
there
is
no
access
to
labor
relations
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
perhaps
not
activity
that
is
totally
at
odds,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
really
think
the
answer
to
the
question
lies
in
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
act
was
adopted
on
the
premise
that
interstate
commerce
would
be
promoted
and
preserved
from
disruption
by
channeling
the
inevitable
disputes
that
arise
between
labor
and
management
into
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
into
opportunities
for
self-organization
if
the
employees
chose
to
exercise
those
opportunities
for
self-organization.
and
denying
the
employees
this
opportunity
for
self-organization
if
they
choose
to
exercise
it
does
not
eliminate
the
possibility
of
differences
of
agreement
or
disputes.
it
eliminates
that
channel
for
expressing
those
disagreements.
and
the
premise
of
the
act
was
that
that
channel
has
to
prevent
disruptions
of
interstate
commerce
and
to
promote
peace.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
understand
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
we're
especially
talking
about
a
drop
in
the
bucket
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
most
instances
the
board
would
find
such
a
secretary
to
come
within
the
labor
nexus.
but
it
feels,
and
i
think
quite
properly,
that
when
someone
makes
a
claim
for
the
board,
it
can't
just
rely
on
labels;
it
has
to
see
what
these
people
actually
do.
and
in
her
case
she
simply
did
not
have
access
to
confidential
labor-related
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly
so,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
an
atypical
case,
but
the
board's
function
is
to
be
fact-specific,
and
there's
certainly
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
the
fact
that
the
board
looked
carefully
at
the
facts
here
and
found
them
to
be
atypical.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
predominance
to
the
labor--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
think
there's
any
percentage.
the
question
is
whether
there
are
confidences
of
that
kind
entrusted
to
the
employee.
if
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--at
all.
other
than
just
an
exceptional
circumstance.
there
has
to
be
some
regularity
with
which
they...
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
any
percentage
of
that
employee's
duties.
but
as
long
as
this
is
a
part
of
that
employees'
duties,
then
the
labor
nexus
test
applies
as
it's
been
refined.
and
i
just
think
that's
the
answer
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
depends
wholly
on
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
mr.
justice.
that's
a
contractual
question.
the
statute
gives
labor
and
management
the
right
to
negotiate
and
enter
into
agreements
that
they
found
mutually
satisfactory.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
with
relation
to
the
secretary,
as
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
no
question
of
her
engaging
in
bargaining.
the
case
is
atypical
in
that
way
as
well.
it
really
is
only
the
malleable
case
that
necessarily
presents
the
question
whether
the
board's
exclusion
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
was
a
union
for
other
employees
but
not
for
secretaries,
and
she
wasn't
involved
in
any
effort
to
engage
in
collective
activity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
those
rights
are
available
to
the
rank
and
file,
i
believe,
mr.
justice.
they
may
not
be
available
to
managers
of
the
company
who
have
been
excluded
from
the
definition
of
employees
under
the
bell
aerospace
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
justice.
but
those
who
can
exercise
that
right
can
also
exercise
these
other
rights.
signing
the
petition
in
the
hendricks
case
is
a
good
example
of
that;
that
is
protected
concerted
activity
for
employees
whether
they're
in
a
bargaining
unit
or
not
in
the
board's
view.
now,
the
labor
nexus
test,
as
i
say,
has
been
refined,
but
it
reflects
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
act's
fundamental
premise:
that
the
opportunity
to
channel
disputes
into
the
bargaining
process
if
the
employees
so
desire
as
a
matter
of
self-organization
is
beneficial,
helps
to
avoid
disruptions
of
commerce;
that
it
by
maximizing
the
employees
who
can
exercise
that
right,
narrowing
the
implied...
and
it's
wholly
implied...
exclusion
from
rights
conferred
by
the
act
to
these
employees
who
need
to
be
brought
within
the
exclusion,
because
otherwise
the
process
itself
would
be
seriously
compromised.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
can't
say
that
it
reflected
a
full
understanding
of
the
board's
development
of
the
law
and
the
reasons
for
it,
but
it
did
in
the
hearings
here
from
industry
spokesmen
who
expressed
a
need
for
a
change
from
the
board's
current
policies
and
from
spokesmen
for
labor
organizations
and
the
board
who
opposed
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
essentially
the
same
policy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
it's
been
refined
slightly
to
make
its
application
more
coherent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
hearings
in
both
the
house
and
senate
the
question
came
up,
and
the
house,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
put
into
its
version
of
the
bill
in
the
amendments
to
the
definition
of
employees
covered
by
the
act,
exclusions
for
confidential
employees,
broadly
defined,
and
for
employees
working
in
labor
relations
departments;
and
to
that
extent
reflected
the
view
that
had
been
espoused
in
the
hearings
that
the
premise
of
the
act
that
i
have
been
referring
to
should
to
that
extent
be
revised
or
repudiated
because
of
the
need
to
assure
the
keeping
of
nonlabor-related
confidences.
the
opposing
argument,
and
it
was
made
with
great
strength
during
the
hearings
and
on
the
floor
in
the
house...
the
matter
never
reached
the
floor
in
the
senate
because
it
was
cut
off
in
the
committee;
the
committee
never
proposed
doing
anything
like
this
to
the
floor
of
the
senate.
but
the
countervailing
argument
that
was
made
is
that
there
is
nothing
about
membership
in
a
labor
organization
or
the
exercise
of
bargaining
rights
that
enhances
whatever
motivation
there
may
be
because
of
disputes
with
the
employer
to
betray
or
not
honor
confidences
that
aren't
related
to
labor-management
relations.
if
anything,
the
premise
of
the
act
is
that
by
channeling
frustrations
into
the
bargaining
process
there's
going
to
be
more
peace
between
labor
and
management.
and
someone
denied
bargaining
rights
may
be
just
as
bitter
or
just
as
frustrated
or
just
as
tempted
to
betray
another
kind
of
confidence
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
essence,
the
house
receded
to
the
senate's
version
which
did
not
include
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
emanated
from
the
conference.
the
two
houses
passed
different
versions
of
the
bill,
and
the
house
receded
with
considerable
explanation.
the
principal
point
that
i
have
been
trying
to
lead
up
to
is
that
the
board's
interpretation
and
its
narrowing
of
the
exclusion
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
act
is
one
that
ordinarily
would
be
entitled
to
deference.
it's
a
consistent,
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
act,
unless
congress
has
in
some
way
revised
it.
the
only
contention
that's
made
in
this
case
is
that
congress
revised
it
in
the
taft-hartley
act,
which
was
really
amendments
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
passed
in
1947.
and
the
more
i
have
looked
at
the
legislative
materials
that
are
pertinent
and
considered
them
in
preparing
this
case,
the
more
firmly
i
am
convinced
that
the
simplest
and
truest
answer
to
that
contention
and
the
dispositive
answer
is
that
even
though
there
was
consideration
of
this
question
during
taft-hartley,
ultimately
congress
did
not
enact
anything
on
the
subject.
and
one
simply
cannot
amend
a
statute
by
committee
explanations
or
explanations
on
the
floor
about
why
no
amendment
was
being
put
before
the
senate
or
the
house
for
a
vote.
that
is
not
anything
that
rises
to
the
level
of
an
exercise
of
the
lawmaking
power
under
article
i
of
the
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they're
entitled
to
great
deference
with
respect
to
anything
that
the
congress
has
enacted,
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
this
case
and
bell
aerospace.
congress
ultimately
decided
to
take
action
with
respect
to
defining
the
line
between
labor
and
management
with
respect
to
overruling
the
packard
motor
company
case.
it
enacted
a
provision
defining
supervisors
and
excluding
them
from
the
act.
now,
it's
true
that
that
provision
was
not
as
comprehensive
in
dealing
with
management
as
it
might
have
been,
and
this
is
why
the
court
divided
5
to
4
in
the
bell
aerospace
case.
but
that
enactment
was
based
on
premises
that
led
to
an
interpretation
of
something
congress
enacted
in
bell
aerospace.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
evidences
a
willingness
of
congress
not
to
disturb
the
way
the
board
has
been
administering
the
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
wholly
consistent,
and
that's
precisely
what
i'm
arguing:
that
whatever
explanations
were
made
in
committee
and
on
the
floor
and
whatever
ambiguities
or
misconceptions
they
may
have
reflected
about
the
state
of
the
law
at
that
time...
and
we
really
quarrel
with
the
contention
that
they
have
to
be
read
as
a
misconception.
the
usual
presumption
is
that
congress
knew
what
the
law
was,
and
i
think
they
can
be
read
consistently
with
that.
but
whatever
misconception
there
may
have
been,
still
what
ultimately
was
put
to
the
membership
of
each
body
was
the
proposition
that
the
board
is
handling
this
all
right,
and
therefore
we
have
not
included
anything
on
this.
and
senator
taft's
explanation
as
he
introduced
the
conference
report
to
the
senate...
and
he
was
the
master
strategist...
was
that
this
was
an
area
of
controversy
that
we
are
avoiding
here.
the
obvious
stratagem
was
to
keep
as
much
consensus
as
possible.
he
had
his
eye
on
other
reforms
that
he
wanted
to
have
made.
he
knew
that
there
would
be
a
veto,
that
he
had
to
have
a
broad
consensus
to
override
a
veto;
and
this
is
why
the
senate
never
reported
this
out
in
the
first
place,
after
the
hearings
which
revealed
the
dissension
on
this
issue,
and
this
is
part
of
the
explanation
that
he
made
in
introducing
it.
if
i
had
time
i
would
read
the
language.
so
ultimately,
while
we
have
some
quarrel,
and
we've
detailed
that
quarrel,
with
the
court's
characterization
of
what
congress
knew
or
thought
of
the
board's
position
on
this
subject,
we
really
don't
think
ultimately
it
matters.
the
footnote
in
bell
aerospace
did
not
attribute
any
legal
consequence
to
what
it
said
congress
thought
was
the
state
of
the
law.
