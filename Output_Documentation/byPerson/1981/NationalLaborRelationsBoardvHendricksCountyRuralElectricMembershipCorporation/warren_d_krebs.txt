mr.
warren
d.
krebs
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i
would
like
to
comment
that
i
am
the
general
counsel
who
is
referred
to
in
the
presentation
for
the
remc,
and
i
can
assure
the
court
and
it
was
not
found
by
the
board
that
i
was
not,
as
the
out-house
counsel
with
an
office
25
miles
away
from
the
cooperative,
in
charge
of
their
labor
relations,
and
neither
were
the
directors
of
the
remc
which
are
farmers
elected
by
the
consumers.
in
fact,
the
court
may
want
to
look
at
a
part
of
the
testimony
which
is
included
in
my
brief
at
page
42
at
the
top
in
which
the
discharged
secretary
herself
testified
that
the
general
manager
had
general
responsibility
for
all
the
labor
relations
of
all
the
employees,
union
employees
as
well
as
those
in
the
office.
the
basic
issue
is
a
very
simple
one,
and
that
is
whether
the
board
should
be
compelled
to
recognize
the
written
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
house
report
that
there
are
certain
positions
in
management
for
employees
loyal
to
management
in
positions
of
trust
and
confidence,
and
that
these
employees
should
not
be
subject
to
influence
or
control
by
labor
unions
or
by
other
employees.
or
whether
is
the
question
shall
we
recognize
the
intent
of
the
board,
which
is
spelled
out
i
think
explicitly
in
its
brief
in
this
case
in
reply
brief,
that
the
intent
of
the
board
is
to
expand
its
jurisdiction
into
every
area
and
to
include
employees
under
the
rights
of
the
act
and
the
act's
coverage,
which
was
never
anticipated
by
congress
in
1947.
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
was
basically
passed
because
of
the
problems
that
congress
was
having
with
the
jurisdictional
questions
of
the
board
from
the
wagner
act,
and
most
of
the
act
or
a
great
deal
of
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
curtailing
that
jurisdiction.
i
think
the--
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
--yes.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
i
don't
think
by
necessity,
and
i
think
one
would
have
to
look
at
the
specific
facts
in
the
malleable
case.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
no.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
i
think
it
very
well
could.
or
administrative
assistants,
which
have
been
excluded
in
prior
cases
by
the
board
itself.
they
don't
now,
but
they
used
to.
personal
secretaries,
individuals
that
have
this
close
relationship
with
management.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
of
any
kind.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
that's
true.
i
think
the
only
way
that
the
board
can
rationalize
its
conclusion
in
the
hendricks
case
can
be
seen
by
its
response
to
the
issue
presented
in
the
cross
petition
for
cert
by
hendricks,
which
issue
was
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
erroneously
concluded
that
the
board
had
decided
that
this
secretary
was
not
employed
in
a
labor
relations
or
personnel
department
capacity.
and
the
only
response
of
the
government
to
that
cross
appeal,
they
concede
that
there
was
no
express
decision
by
the
board,
but
they
say
that
that
impliedly
was
made
because
the
board
had
concluded
that
she
was
not
a
confidential
employee.
and
that
basically
is
the
crux
of
how
the
board
has
over
the
years
since
1957
limited
the
exclusions;
and
that
is,
they
have
combined
two
separate
and
specific
exclusions
which
are
contained
in
both
the
summary
of
senator
taft
given
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
when
the
bill
was
passed
and
in
the
house
conference
committee
report
written
by
congressman
hartley.
and
that
is
that
there
were
two
separate
exclusions
that
both
felt
existed
at
that
time,
and
that
is,
the
labor
relations
personnel
employment
area
exclusion,
and
separate,
the
confidential
exclusion.
and
the
board
has
over
the
years
co-mingled
the
two
and
come
up
with
the
confidential
labor
relations
exclusion;
and
that
effectively
terminates
the
effectiveness
of
both
exclusions.
and
that
is
the
only
way
that
one
can
reach
the
result
in
hendricks
especially
that
this
personal
secretary
to
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
company
is
included
under
the
act
and
has
rights
as
any
other
employee
when
he
was
specifically
on
the
labor
negotiating
committee,
a
point
that
the
board
previously
in
1957
in
the
ethel
case
found
sufficient
to
exclude
a
secretary
when
he
was
the
ultimate
resolver
of
grievances
at
the
company,
even
though
the
court
previously
in
the
gm
case
in
1943
excluded
numerous
individuals.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
yes.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
yes.
for
certain--
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
--there
are
two
areas
here,
yes.
the
second
area
comes
in,
but
they
are
by
necessity
interlinked
because
of
the
confusion
that
the
board
has
made
by
linking
the
two
since
1957
in
its
b.f.
goodrich
case
in
which
they--
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
--i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
yes.
and
i
think
that's
clear
from
the
act,
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1974
in
the
bell
aerospace
case,
which
five
of
the
present
members
of
the
court
concurred
in.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
i
think
that's
my
position.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
as
to
the
court's
decision
in
bell
aerospace,
it's
very
specific
that
this
court
found
that
there
were
two
exclusions
intended
by
congress,
and
specifically
stated
that
among
those
impliedly
excluded
were
persons
working
in
labor
relations
personnel
and
employment
areas,
and
"confidential
employees".
the
dissenting
opinion
written
by
justice
white
in
that
case
did
not
disagree
with
that
point.
and
in
fact,
justice
white
said
that
the
house
manager's
statement
accompanying
the
conference
committee
report
explains
that
the
act
was
not
amended
expressly
to
exclude
labor
relations
and
confidential
employees.
the
five
separate
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
also
concluded
that
these
are
separate
exclusions,
and
perhaps
beginning
with
the
1966
decision
in
the
d.c.
circuit
in
retail
clerks
international
written
by
now
chief
justice
burger
that
these
individuals
are
more
closely
aligned
with
management
regardless
of
any
labor
relations
department
type
classification.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
each
one
of
the
cases
that
i
have
were
decided
prior
to,
and
one
of
them
was
the
circuit
court's
decision
in
bell
aerospace
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
'74.
i
think
the
main
crux
of
the
issue
comes
also
down,
as
far
as
recognizing
the
difference
in
these
exclusions,
in
footnote
12
to
the
bell
aerospace
decision
in
which
this
court
specifically
stated
regarding
confidential
employees
that
these
are
people
who
receive
from
their
employers
information
that
not
only
is
confidential
but
also
is
not
available
to
the
public
or
to
competitors
or
to
employees
generally.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
i
think
that
is
dictum
in
the
case,
but
i
think
it's
very
important
dictum
because
the
issue
there
was
the
board
had
taken
the
labor
nexus
standard
and
had
attempted
to
limit
managerial
employees
by
the
same
standard
that
they've
attempted
to
limit
confidential
employees.
and
the
court--
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
--beg
your
pardon?
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
that's
true.
well,
the
dictum
and
the
language
which
footnote
12
supports,
which
was
the
decision
that
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
both
labor
relations
personnel
and
confidential
personnel.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
every
secretary
for
an
individual
engaged
in
labor
relations?
i
think
that's
the--
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
--right.
that
has
access.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
depending
upon
what
his
role
in
labor
relations
is.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
that's
right.
it
is
separate.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
that's
true.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
well,
i
think
there
is
in
limiting
the
confidential
exclusion
to
the
labor
relations
nexus
only
and
not
considering
other
situations.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
an
example
is
their
decision
in
1980
in
the
missouri
valley
hospital
employees
case
in
which
they
held
that
the
personal
secretary
to
the
president
of
the
company
could
join
a
labor
union;
and
they
made
this
decision
in
1980.
and
the
rationale
was
the
president
had
delegated
most
of
the
areas
of
labor
relations
to
other
individuals
within
the
corporate
structure,
and
therefore,
his
secretary
could
be
a
member
of
the
union,
which
is
what
they
found,
although
perhaps
somebody
else's
could
not
be.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
i
think
the
intent
of
the
congress
as
placed
in
the
house
report
was
that
they
looked
at
individuals
who
were
involved
in
areas
of
highly,
and
they
did
use
that
term,
highly
confidential
areas
of
the
company.
and
the
company
would
not--
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
--professionals
are
a
different
category
under
the
act,
to
my
understanding.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
they
are
dealt
with,
as
i
understand
it,
under
a
different
provision
of
the
act,
not
the
confidential
provision.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
that's
true.
some
of
them
could
have.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
i
don't
believe
they
are.
mr.
warren
d.
krebs
well,
i
guess
back
to
the
confidential
part
of
it
is
the
very
interesting
item,
and
congress
in
the
hartley
report,
which
is
the
house
report,
in
discussing
this
and
why
they
didn't
want
to
just
limit
it
to
labor
relations
said
that
it
shouldn't
be
up
to
the
good
faith
of
the
board
or
the
unions
to
decide
what
information
is
going
to
get
out
of
the
company.
now,
the
argument
on
the
other
side
to
that
is
the
company
has
a
right
to
discipline
employees
who
leak
out
confidential
information.
and
that
is
well
and
good
except
when
one
takes
into
consideration
the
board's
decision
in
1980
in
the
texas
instruments
case,
which
luckily
was
reversed
by
the
first
circuit
in
1981,
and
that
decision
was
employees
who
are
in
the
process
of
organizing
had
the
right
to
distribute
on
the
street
corner
the
confidential
information
of
the
company,
even
though
there
was
a
valid
plant
rule
against
such
disclosure,
because
we
were
interfering
with
their
rights,
and
therefore
the
company
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
dismissing
those
employees.
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
notion
of
congress
in
1947
that
we
cannot
depend
upon
the
board
or
upon
the
unions
or
the
employees
to
insure
that
certain
types
of
highly
confidential
information,
which
the
board
said
it
was
confidential,
will
not
be
disclosed
to
the
general
public
or
to
competitors.
the
interesting
part,
i
think,
about
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
they
have
also
argued
in
this
case
in
my
opinion
at
least
two
separate
standards
for
the
exclusion.
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
13
they
indicate
that
in
their
opinion
secretaries
to
all
persons
with
managerial
functions
in
the
field
of
labor
relations
are
excluded.
that
is
not
the
position
that
they
presented
in
the
initial
brief
or
the
position
that
they
held
in
the
hendricks
case.
in
the
hendricks
case
the
board
specifically
held
that
she
was
not
excluded
because
her
duties
did
not
involve
her
in
a
confidential
capacity
with
her
employer's
responsibility
with
respect
to
labor
relations
policies
as
opposed
to
labor
implementation
or
the
grievance
procedure
in
the
company.
there
are
two
separate
standards
included
even
in
the
briefs
of
the
board
in
this
specific
case,
and
i
cannot
reconcile
the
two.
but
i
think
it
highlights
the
confusion
in
this
area
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
courts
in
the
retail
clerks
case
in
1976,
again
by
chief
justice
burger,
where
he
recognized,
and
five
other
courts
of
appeals
have
made
the
same
decision
subsequent
to
1966,
that
prior
to
1966
the
board
had
a
separate
strand
of,
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
managerial
employees
which
they
had
always
excluded.
these
employees
did
not
have
confidential
information,
were
not
involved
in
labor
relations
or
the
formulation
of
any
other
policies.
but
the
reason
for
the
exclusion
was
that
they
were
so
aligned
or
related
to
management
to
place
them
in
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
between
labor
on
the
one
hand
and
management
on
the
other;
and
therefore,
the
board
had
always
excluded
these
types
of
people,
although
they
didn't
give
them
a
categorical
name.
and
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
type
of
people,
and
a
couple
of
the
circuit
courts
in
discussing
this
have
used
the
term
"confidential
employee"
as
synonymous
with
those
employees
aligned
and
related
to
management
to
have
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
so
i
think
that
there
are
two
viable
exclusions.
both
should
be
recognized
by
the
court.
both
were
recognized
in
the
bell
case.
the
court
specifically
said
in
the
bell
case
that
the
confidential...
in
the
dictum
that
the
confidential
exclusion
was
not
limited
to
just
confidential
and
labor
relations,
because
if
the
court
had
ruled
that
way,
then
the
premise
of
the
board
that
managerial
limitation
exclusion
should
also
be
limited
by
labor
relations
was
also
correct,
which
of
course
in
1974
by
a
5
to
4
decision
the
court
held
that
that
was
not
true.
