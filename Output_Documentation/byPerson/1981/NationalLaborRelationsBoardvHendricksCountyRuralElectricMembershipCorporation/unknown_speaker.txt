unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
isn't
malleable
an
easier
case
for
the
government
than
hendricks?
unknown
speaker
does
that
suggest
that
you
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference
or
a
difference
between
a
confidential
secretary
and
a
shipping
clerk
on
the
other
end
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
wasn't
the
secretary
a
superior
on
the
management
side
under
bell?
unknown
speaker
so
he's
excluded
under
bell
aerospace.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
board
wouldn't
have
excluded
him.
unknown
speaker
but
bell
disagreed
with
the
board--
unknown
speaker
--this
secretary
was
working
for
a
superior
who
himself
was
excluded
under
bell.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
applies
with
the
same
force
to
the
secretary
to
the
chief
executive
officer
and
the
other
ten
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
conduct
of
a
personal
secretary...
let's
not
worry
about
the
titles...
the
number
one
secretary
to
the
number
one
executive
officer
of
an
enterprise,
is
it
compatible
if
that
secretary
is
engaging
in
activity
that
is
totally
at
odds
with
the
management
decisions
and
policies?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
manager
thought
so
sufficiently
to
discharge
her.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
now
about
the
mass
of
employees,
aren't
you?
i'm
addressing
my
question
to
just
the
number
one
secretary
to
the
number
one
executive
officer,
which
in
the
aggregate
in
the
whole
united
states
is
a
drop
in
the
bucket
of
the
labor
force,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
barely
a
drop.
unknown
speaker
contrary
to
what
would
be
the
case
with
secretaries
to
most
chief
executive
officers.
unknown
speaker
he's
not
much
of
a
chief
executive
officer
if
he
doesn't
have
access
to--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace,
secretaries
to
top
management
in
companies
deal
with
the
problems
their
bosses
have
to
deal
with,
and
if
you're
at
the
top
management
level
in
the
great
companies...
there
may
be
several
hundred
of
them...
the
problems
that
they
deal
with
vary
from
day
to
day,
and
often
when
they
arrive
at
their
office
in
the
morning
they
have
no
idea
what
sort
of
problems
will
be
coming
across
their
desk.
what
does
the
board
do
when
it
has
a
secretary
like
that
where...
do
they
count
up
the
days
of
the
year
and
decide
which
of
those
days
there
was
some
labor
nexus,
or
what
does
the
board
do?
unknown
speaker
ten
percent
or--
unknown
speaker
--at
all.
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
no
labor
nexus
at
all
was
found.
would
this
mean
that
seniority
rules
would
apply
in
the
union,
and
if
the
secretary
had
to
be
replaced
the
union
would
determine
the
next
secretary?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
a
union
here,
mr.
wallace?
unknown
speaker
she
was
in
no--
unknown
speaker
--well,
tell
me,
was
there
a
union
at
all
here?
unknown
speaker
she
was
not
within
the
bargaining
unit
defined
by
that.
unknown
speaker
and
the
board
draws
a
line,
does
it
not,
between
some
employees
who
may
be
confidential
employees
so
that
they're
excluded
from
being
members
of
a
bargaining
unit,
and
at
the
same
time
they
may
exercise
rights
which
are
not
available
to
the
rank
and
file
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
some
employees
under
the
board's
view
who
may
exercise
rights
other
than
participating
in
a
rank
and
file
bargaining
unit.
unknown
speaker
did
the
congress
at
the
time
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
mr.
wallace,
give
any
consideration
to
the
board's
policy,
the
board's
definition,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
focusing
on
the
so-called
labor
nexus?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
same
policy
today
as
it
was
then,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
going
back
to
shortly
after
the
wagner
act.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
hearing
consideration
was
given
to
this
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happened
to
the
proposal
in
the
house?
unknown
speaker
was
this
in
conference
or
was
this--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
you're
having
a
general
overhaul
of
appeal
of
the
law,
certainly
explanations
of
a
conference
committee
as
to
why
something
was
not
included
are
entitled
to
some
deference,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
this
argument
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
position
the
labor
board
takes
with
regard
to
the
national
policy
in
favor
of
industry
wide
bargaining
in
a
case
coming
down
the
line
shortly
here.
the
failure
to
prohibit
it,
in
that
case
the
government
argues,
evidenced
a
national
policy
in
favor
of
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
krebs,
can
i
interrupt
with
one
broad
question
similar
to
one
justice
rehnquist
asked
your
adversary.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
terms
of
legal
analysis
there's
any
difference
between
the
two
cases?
does
the
confidential
rationale,
if
it's
valid,
cover
that
whole
group
of
employees
in
the
other
case
just
as
much
as
the
secretary
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
confine
your
argument
to
secretaries.
unknown
speaker
it
would
include
bookkeepers
and
clerical
personnel
who
had
access
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
isn't
the
close
relationship,
at
least
under
the
court
of
appeals
rationale,
that's
controlling;
it's
the
access
to
confidential
information.
of
any
kind.
unknown
speaker
that's
secret
formulas
and
customer
lists
and
all
that.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
court
agreed
with
your
position
in
the
cross
petition,
you
could
win
and
the
malleable
case
could
go
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
two
arrows.
unknown
speaker
did
you
file
the
cross
petition?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
granted?
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
have
two
arrows.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
board
would
exclude
her
if
they
had
found
that
her
employer
had
access
to...
was
engaged
in
labor
relations
matters.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
your
position
is
that
it
need
not
be
confined
to
labor
relations
but
overall
managerial
activities
of
the
chief
executive.
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
correct,
mr.
krebs,
if
you
lost
out
on
the
proposition
that
merely
a
confidential
secretary,
merely
being
a
personal
secretary
is
not
enough
to
exclude
her?
you'd
say
on
this
record,
in
any
event
under
your
cross
petition,
her
situation
and
the
general
manager's
satisfied
the
labor
nexus
test.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
those
five
circuits
decided
their
cases
after
bell
aerospace?
unknown
speaker
do
you
regard
that
as
dictum
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
rely
on
bell
aerospace,
you
must
rely
on
that
dictum,
must
you
not?
unknown
speaker
i
say
if
you
get
any
comfort
out
of
bell
aerospace,
you
get
it
only
out
of
that
dictum.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
know
that
the
board
disagrees
with
that.
you
wouldn't
say
that
just
because...
you
wouldn't
say
that
every
secretary
for
every
person
who
is
engaged
in
labor
relations
is
excluded.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
it
is
not.
it's
confidential.
it
has
to
be
a
confidential
secretary,
one
that
has
access
to
confidential
labor
relations
information.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
so
it
just
isn't...
you
wouldn't
say
that
every
secretary
who...
you
wouldn't
exclude
the
secretary
because
that
person
is
engaged
in
labor
relations.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
never
get
to
the
confidential
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
two
separate
concepts.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
see
anything
that
the
board
is...
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
denial
in
the
board's
position
that
they
are
two
separate
concepts.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
an
argument
that
the
board
should
give
a
wider
scope
to
the
confidential
issue.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
that's
wrong,
and
perhaps
you
should
win
on
your
cross
petition.
that
certainly
doesn't
reach
the
notion
that
every
confidential
employee
in
the
company
should
be
excluded.
unknown
speaker
are
professionals
excluded?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
dealt
with
specifically,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
they
certainly
have...
some
of
them
have
confidential
information
and
some
of
them
don't.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
are
not
excluded
even
if
they
have
confidential
information,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
do
anything
to
your
argument
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
is
a
dictum?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
the
decision
have
been
just
as
cogent
without
that
footnote?
unknown
speaker
why?
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
forget
footnote
12
for
a
moment.
why
would
you
argue
that
a
provision
of
a
house
bill
that
was
never
passed
should
control
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
it
is
just
that
you
are
relying
on
footnote
12.
how
about
just
putting
footnote
12
out
of
your
mind
for
a
moment,
and
tell
me
what
in
the
congressional
history
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
that
standard
should
control
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
adopted,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
and
eliminated
that
provision.
didn't
adopt
that
provision.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
conference
report
may
have
been
erroneous
in
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
the
conference
report
may
not
have
accurately
reflected
the
decisions
of
the
nlrb.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mueller,
may
i
ask
you
a
general
question?
what
happens
in
defense
industries
that
have
contracts
on
highly
confidential
or
secret
work
with
the
defense
department?
take
the
stealth
aircraft,
for
example.
i
don't
know
the
contractor
that
is
working
on
that,
but
number
one,
is
there
a
union,
or
when
there
are
unions,
are
any
employees
excluded
because
of
confidential
information
to
which
they
have
access?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
cases--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
saying
in
substance
that
the
board
relies
on
the
labor
nexus
even
in
the
most
sensitive
defense
work?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
seventh
circuit,
under
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
every
employee
in
the
defense
industry
who
has
access
to
classified
information
would
be
excluded
from
the
collective
bargaining--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
your
reading
of
the
seventh
circuit
opinion?
unknown
speaker
why?
i
thought
it
was
any
confidential
information.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
exclude
them
because
they
are
professionals,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
mueller.
let
me
ask
you
just
one
question,
though.
would
the
employer
have
some
disciplinary
reach
over
an
employee,
even
a
member
of
the
union
covered
by
the
act,
who
had
violated
the
confidentiality?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
even
if
the
employee
is
excluded
from
the
bargaining
unit,
the
employer
has
got
the
same
stake
in
his
keeping
his
mouth
shut,
and
he
is
going
to
have
to
police
his
own
rules.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
he
is
not
part
of
it,
he
is
going
to
have
to
police
his
own
rules.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not.
whether
he
is
in
the
bargaining
unit
may
not
determine
whether
he
is
going
to
keep
his
mouth
shut.
