thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
northern
pipeline
construction
against
marathon
pipe
line
and
the
related
case.
we'll
just
wait
for
the
courtroom
to
clear
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
think
you
may
proceed
now
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
this
on
the
phased
in
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
1984
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
--
is
there
a
severability
clause
in
the
acts
that
would
several
the
non-bankruptcy
matters
from
the
bankruptcy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
for
--
for
example,
if
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
were
appealed
to
--
was
respect
to
a
bankruptcy
judge.
and
ignore
the
many
people
or
someone
present
by
what
habeas
corpus
had
to
do
with
bankruptcy.
but
if
the
issue
was
raised
there,
could
a
court
declare
that
section,
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
violated
the
constitution
without
damaging
the
rest
of
the
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
congress,
mr.
solicitor
general,
have
made
the
administration
of
bankruptcy
problems
totally
and
wholly
administrative
with
traditional
--
judicial
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
having
any
judges
at
all
in
the
bankruptcy
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
devney.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
was
originally
drafted
with
the
article
iii
courts
in
mind,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
couldn't
you
broaden
that,
the
gravity
of
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
orenstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
raise
your
voice
a
little
bit,
mr.
orenstein?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
compare
with
the
situation
of
the
court
of
military
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

--
wasn't
the
court
created
as
--
as
a
civilian
court
in
effect
as
a
check
or
a
second
look
at
the
military
decisions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
it
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
you
now
addressing
the
wisdom
of
the
statute
of
differing
the
time
when
an
article
iii
court
can
review
rather
than
the
constitutionality.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
because
it's
inconvenient,
doesn't
make
something
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
say
that
you
are
not
attacking
all
of
it.
now
going
to
this
matter
of
convenience
or
inconvenience,
could
conceivably
an
article
iii
court
somewhere
decide
that
the
appeal
from
the
bankruptcy
--
article
i
bankruptcy
judges
to
the
three
panel
article
i
group
was
either
unconstitutional
or
else
under
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
court
possibly,
but
only
possibly,
that
there
must
be
an
appeal
directly
to
the
article
iii
united
states
court
of
appeals
and
then
solve
that
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
so
can
the
magistrates.
chief
justice
warren
e.

so
can
the
magistrates.
chief

even
when
it
allows
the
appellate
review
by
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
by
an
article
iii
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
let's
(voice

a
moment
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
getting
back
up
to
one
of
your
earlier
responses,
it
gave
me
the
impression
that
you
thought
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
to
get
some
leave
or
approval
from
the
judiciary
in
order
to
create
the
labor
board
or
the
federal
communications
commission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
was
exercising
its
own
inherent
constitutional
powers,
was
it
not,
when
they
created
these
agencies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
federal
communications
committee
can
give
--
a
commission
can
give
or
it
can
take
away
a
broadcast
license
worth
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
instance
but
as
justice
white
pointed
out
the
court
of
appeals
is
at
least
bound
to
affirm
what
the
commission
has
done,
if
it's
supported
by
substantial
evidence
even
if
they
disagree
with
the
result
reached.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
through
the
federal
power
commission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
when
congress
pass
this
act
it
had
called
these
bankruptcy
people
bankruptcy
magistrates
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
what
about
it?
does
the
name
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
their
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
unusual
about
congress
changing
its
positions
during
the
course
of
the
evolution
of
a
statutory
scheme
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
deciding
on
one's
act
and
have
amendments,
conferences
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
be
more
final
than
any
of
the
commissions
that
justice
white
and
others
have
mentioned
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
--
the
federal
communications,
federal
power,
labor
board,
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
territorial
judges
try
jury
cases?
chief

e.
burger
then
what's
the
current
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
that
only
became

mr.

you

chief

from
what
article

the

mr.

did
the
congress
derive
its
power
