mr.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
on
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1978,
which
represents
congress'
most
comprehensive
effort
in
this
century
and
perhaps
in
history
to
deal
with
bankruptcies.
the
problems
that
congress
identified
were
serious
including
an
increase
in
the
number
of
annual
filings
from
10,000
a
year
to
over
254,000
a
year
in
a
period
of
only
three
decades.
one
of
the
most
serious
impediments
to
an
efficient
bankruptcy
system,
the
congress
found
was
the
court's
--
that
was
the
court
system,
and
particularly
the
confusing
distinction
between
summary
and
plenary
jurisdiction.
the
1978
act
creates
a
bankruptcy
act
in
each
district
as
an
adjunct
to
the
district
court.
judges
of
the
new
bankruptcy
courts
are
to
be
appointed
to
14-year
terms
by
the
president,
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
they
may
be
removed
by
the
“judicial
council
of
the
circuit”
for
“incompetence,
misconduct,
or
disability”
and
they
have
plenary
jurisdiction
over
bankruptcy
matters.
mr.
lee
that
is
correct.
they
are
the
six
years
--
six-year
period
but
the
act
substantively
would
apply
with
the
exception
of
the
personnel
over
the
interim
period.
mr.
lee
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
correct.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
constitution
does
not
preclude
congress'
chosen
resolution
of
the
important
and
difficult
bankruptcy
problems
that
congress
identified.
article
i
specification
of
congressional
power
to
establish
uniform
laws
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcies
throughout
the
united
states
includes
the
power
to
establish
specialized
bankruptcy
courts
and
give
them
plenary
jurisdiction
over
their
narrow
specialty
of
bankruptcy.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
article
iii
towards
values
that
brings
that
article
into
conflict
in
this
case
with
article
i.
mr.
lee
certainly
not.
mr.
lee
on
the
basis
of
the
guidelines
that
this
court
laid
down
in
palmore
which
were
--
but
you
have
to
have,
first
of
all,
of
course,
you
have
to
have
one
of
the
specific
grant
of
legislative
authority
to
congress.
but
in
addition
you
have
to
have
a
specialized
area
in
which
congress
concludes
that
there
is
a
particularized
need
warranting
distinctive
treatment
for
a
specialized
court.
mr.
lee
surely.
mr.
lee
as
--
my
answer
to
that
is,
“yes”,
justice
rehnquist.
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion
in
palmore,
i
believe
that
that
is
what
the
court
meant
by
specialized
area
and
certainly
that
is
our
view
of
what
is
meant
by
specialized
area.
but
it
has
to
be
a
special
link.
mr.
lee
and
that
is
one
of
the
major
criticisms
that
was
raised
against
it
by
our
opponents.my
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
the
first
is
that
the
--
that
it
does
include
a
number
of
possible
types
of
actions
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
can
entertain,
gets
right
to
the
heart
of
the
fundamental
problem
that
congress
identified
as
the
serious
impediment
to
an
efficient
and
a
fairer
bankruptcy
system.
mr.
lee
i
am
not
aware
of
the
severability
clause,
your
honor,
but
of
course
this
court
has
clarified
on
me
occasions
that
--
that
that
is
not
dispositive
and
in
effect
that
the
court
will
interpret
in
such
a
way
as
to
say
rather
than
to
--
mr.
lee
i
would
think
clearly
so
and
i
would
think
also
that
there
are
other
means
available
ultimately
to
this
court
and
indeed
short
of
this
court
that
would
be
less
severe
such
as
the
doctrine
of
abstention
is
applicable
in
the
case
of
the
bankruptcy
courts.
it
may
of
the
three
evidence
of
appeal
eventually
leads
to
article
iii
determination
and
ultimately,
therefore
to
this
court.
i
realized
that
there
is
a
parade
of
horribles
that
has
been
suggested.
the
reason
that
it
has
been
suggested
is
that
the
distinction
between
plenary
and
summary
jurisdiction
led
to
a
circumstance
in
which
so
many
times
in
the
complicated
bankruptcy
cases
and
sometimes
in
the
noncomplicated
ones.
all
of
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt
were
being
consumed
by
litigating
this
subject
of
whether
it
was
summary
or
was
plenary.
the
bankrupt
could
have
his
--
his
assets
--
his
assets
distributed
and
could
be
declared
a
bankrupt.
but
in
the
event
that
he
had
a
claim
that
needed
to
be
satisfied,
or
in
the
event
that
the
claim
needed
be
satisfied
against
the
bankrupt,
that
could
not
be
handled
by
the
particular
court.
and
that's
the
problem
that
congress
attempted
to
satisfy.
now
the
theory
is,
as
it
has
been
suggested
here,
that
this
could
lead
to
a
rather
broad
range
of
potential
types
of
lawsuits
that
would
traditionally
be
handled
by
article
iii
courts
that
could
--
out
of
the
statute,
be
handled
by
the
article
i
court.
the
first
answer
to
that
is,
but
that
is
the
very
type
of
problem
that
congress
saw
as
the
most
serious
problem
under
that
that
was
precluding
an
efficient
bankruptcy
system.
now
it
may
be
that
in
some
other
case,
it
will
be
a
sufficient
case
of
the
article
i
tail
weighing
the
article
iii
dog
that
there
might
be
either
some
administrative
problems
or
prudential
problems
or
even
some
problems
that
would
rise
at
the
level
of
constitutionality,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
lies
right
at
the
core
of
the
very
problem
that
everyone
agreed
congress
needed
to
take
care
of
where
the
bankrupt
had
a
claim
against
someone
else
and
in
the
process
of
this
reorganization
petition
needed
to
be
resolved.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
there
are
constitutional
problems
raised
by
the
parade
of
horribles,
that's
for
another
case
and
indeed
i
suspect
that
is
the
case
with
the
continuing
interpretation
of
many
complex
statutes,
it
will
be
arrived
at
short
of
a
determination
of
constitutionality.
mr.
lee
oh,
only
if
the
parties
consented.
mr.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
that
is
our
position.
it
is
of
course
subject
--
mr.
lee
well,
there
is
the
precedent
in
the
macdonald
versus
plymouth
and
schumacher
versus
beeler
cases
that
that
could
be
done
by
consent.
now
concededly,
those
were
by
--
those
were
true
adjuncts
to
the
article
iii
court
in
those
days
and
that's
my
fullest
answer
to
that
proposition.
our
rejoinder
to
it
and
i'll
save
a
little
of
his
time
by
making
his
rejoinder.
our
rejoinder
to
it
is
that
in
the
schumacher
versus
beeler
case,
the
court
in
talking
about
this
consent
jurisdiction
to
do
--
to
decide
those
kinds
of
cases
referred
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
374.
the
court
said,
“the
congress
by
virtue
of
its
constitutional
authority
over
bankruptcies
could
confer
or
withhold
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
suits
which
at
least
by
way
of
victim
says
that
this
court
can
do
that
very
thing.”
but
the
big
point,
justice
stevens,
in
my
view
is
this;
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
contexts
in
the
past
that
article
iii
does
not
exhaust
the
congress's
path
or
to
establish
courts.
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
no
precedent
for
this
one,
no
square
precedent
for
it,
should
not
be
that
surprising
because
there
was
no
press
--
square
precedent
for
palmore
or
for
bakelite
or
for
crowell
versus
benson.
the
control
that
is
imposed
on
congress's
power
to
establish
the
courts
other
than
under
article
iii
is
the
control
that
was
articulated
in
palmore
versus
the
united
states.
that
is
to
say
there
must
be
a
particularized
need,
a
special
area
requiring
expertise
requiring
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lee
no.
i
do
not.
and
of
course,
it's
fruitless
for
me
to
tell
this
court
what
it
meant
by
specialized
area.
there
--
there
are
the
two
different
views.
but
i
submit
that
if
the
court
in
palmore
had
meant
specialized
--
had
meant
specialized
area
to
mean
federal
real
estate,
it
would
have
said
so.
usually
when
this
court
refers
to
enclaves
it
does
not
refer
to
the
means
of
specialized
areas.
and
even
more
important,
when
you
look
at
the
whole
concept
of
congress's
power
to
create
non-article
iii
courts,
it
does
tie
back
to
the
fact
that
some
subject
matters,
some
subject
areas
by
their
nature
do
require
specialized
courts
and
bankruptcy
is
one
of
those
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
if
you
look
at
that
list,
17
powers,
17
clauses
that
consists
--
that
constitute
article
i
section
8
of
all
of
them,
there
is
none
that
is
linked
quite
so
directly
to
the
resolution
of
private
disputes
as
does
bankruptcy.
mr.
lee
my
answer
to
that
question
--
mr.
lee
my
answer
to
that
question
is,
“yes,
congress
could
have
done
that.”
that
is
not
the
area
that
congress
--
mr.
lee
oh,
i
don't
know
--
well,
i
think
that's
why
it
would
have
been
ineffective.
i
don't
think
they
could
have
given
--
administratively
--
mr.
lee
well,
they
could
not
have
--
i
don't
know.
yes,
well
--
i
simply
misunderstood
the
chief
justice
--
the
thrust
of
the
chief
justice's
question.
coming
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
--
mr.
lee
well,
my
answer
is
that
congress
could
have
solved
this
problem
by
relegating
whatever
power
it
could
constitutionally
have
given
to
administrative
agencies
but
i
do
not
think
it
could
have
given
--
i
don't
think
it
could
constitutionally
have
given
to
administrative
entities
the
power
to
do
the
kinds
of
things
that
these
judges
have
the
power
to
do.
mr.
lee
well,
entertain
the
suit
in
--
in
this
case.
i
think
that
--
that
whatever
--
that
either
under
article
iii
or
article
i,
there
is
a
certain
responsibility
when
it
comes
to
--
when
it
comes
to
deciding
matters
of
that
--
of
that
magnitude
that
they
must
be
construed
as
--
with
a
judge.
and
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
bankruptcy
in
this
country,
there
--
there
has
been
about
a
two
century
experiment
with
how
to
do
it
best.
almost
from
the
beginnings
of
our
republic,
in
1800,
the
first
bankruptcy
statute
was
passed.
and
from
then
until
1841,
bankruptcy
actions
were
strictly
involuntary
and
retaliatory.
they
could
only
be
used
against
the
bankrupt.
the
1841
change
provided
for
voluntary
proceedings
and
then
in
1898,
it
was
the
last
major
change
when
congress
brought
them
into
existence,
the
referee
system
with
power
to
exercise
summary
jurisdiction.
the
one
constant
feature
over
almost
two
centuries
of
bankruptcy
had
is
that
this
is
a
field
that
has
been
separate
and
specialized.
it
has
never
been
anything
but
separate
and
specialized.
and
therefore,
justice
o'connor,
i
conclude
for
this
reason,
plus
the
fact
that
bankruptcy
itself
really
almost
by
definition
anticipates
the
resolution
of
private
controversies,
these
above
all
case
--
this
is
above
all
other
areas
is
a
specialized
area.
mr.
lee
there
are
some
who
have
suggested
that.
mr.
lee
there
are
some
rule
have
suggested
that.
and
my
simple
answer
to
that
is
--
that
is
not
this
case.
it
is
going
to
be
difficult
enough
at
best
to
solve
this
case
and
you
don't
need
to
solve
the
next
one
in
the
process
of
this
one.
this
case
involves
a
commercial
dispute
in
which
the
creditor
had
a
contract
--
excuse
me
--
the
debtor
had
a
contract
claim
and
this
is
right
at
the
core
of
what
congress
intended.
and
this
is
not
--
at
least
so
far
as
i
understand
part
of
the
--
of
the
parade
of
horribles.
one
final
point
with
respect
to
palmore,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
distinctions
between
palmore
in
this
case,
they
cut
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
1978
act.
one
is
that
--
one
of
the
distinctions
is
that
this
case
does
involve
bankruptcy,
which
is
i
say
does
anticipate
the
resolution
of
conflicting
private
claims.
and
the
second
is,
that
this
case,
that
palmore
involved
a
criminal
prosecution
and
this
case
involves
bankruptcy.
in
terms
of
relevant
constitutional
values,
if
there
is
to
be
a
distinction
between
criminal
prosecutions
on
the
one
hand
and
bankruptcy
on
the
other,
certainly,
there
is
a
greater
need
for
the
protection
of
the
more
independent
article
iii
judge
where
the
interest
at
stake
affect
life
and
liberty
as
well
as
property.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
that
is
only
saying,
justice
rehnquist,
one
that
arose
under
clause
17
and
this
one
arises
under
clause
4.
mr.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
this
one
is
more
like
crowell
v.
benson
and
bakelite.
mr.
lee
thank
you,
just
very
briefly.
mr.
orenstein
spoke
of
article
iii
values.
there
are
two
constitutional
values
that
are
implicated
in
this
case.
they
come
from
two
sources,
article
i
and
article
iii.
both
are
part
of
the
constitution
and
both
must
be
taken
into
account.
on
the
article
i
side,
congress
has
a
responsibility
to
establish
uniform
laws
of
bankruptcy.
this
court
has
clarified
in
several
opinions
in
(inaudible)
and
palmore
among
them.
that
congress
is
entitled
to
particular
deference
than
there
is
evidence
that
congress
actually
analyzed
the
constitutional
issue
and
did
its
best
to
resolve
it.
the
legislative
history
leaves
no
doubt
that
congress
would
have
enacted
the
1978
act
had
before
the
palmore
standards
and
did
its
best
to
apply
them.
those
standards
by
their
very
definition,
specialization
of
the
area,
particularization
of
the
need
and
distinctiveness
of
the
appropriate
treatment
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
lend
themselves
best,
congressional
factfinding
and
decision.
on
the
article
iii
side,
it
is
frankly
difficult
to
see
what
damage
if
any
has
been
done
by
this
act.
i
have
been
puzzled
throughout
my
entire
consideration
of
this
case
and
frankly
i
was
puzzled
during
mr.
orenstein's
argument.
i
am
not
certain
whether
the
opponents
of
the
statute
would
like
it
to
be
more
like
an
article
iii
court
or
less
like
an
article
iii
court.
but
in
any
event,
we
agree
with
the
appellee
on
this
proposition
that
the
tenure
and
compensation
guarantees
are
rooted
in
separation
of
powers
concerns
in
the
sense
that
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
with
which
we're
concerned
is
largely
in
independence
from
other
branches
of
government.
so
that
the
--
mr.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
absolutely
not.
mr.
lee
absolutely
not.
the
article
iii
concerns
would
be
the
greatest
therefore
in
those
cases
where
another
branch
of
government
is
always
or
frequently
the
other
party.
that
is
the
case
with
the
court
of
claims,
tax
court
or
the
court
of
the
military
appeals,
it
is
not
the
case
with
bankruptcy.
the
appellee's
view
is
apparently
that
congress
must
either
give
primary
jurisdiction
over
bankruptcy
to
the
district
courts
which
congress
has
the
(inaudible)
over
eight
years
of
consideration
of
this
problem
will
not
work.
or
confer
article
iii
status
on
bankruptcy
courts
thereby
swelling
the
ranks
of
the
tenured
judiciary
in
a
proportion
that
has
never
occurred
in
this
country
and
what
raised
serious
questions
about
diluting
the
quality
of
the
article
iii
judiciary
and
there
is
evidence
of
that
concern
in
the
house
report.
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
constitution
and
certainly
nothing
in
common
sense
that
so
limits
congress's
choices
and
the
decision
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
lee
it's
my
understanding
--
i
could
be
wrong,
it's
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
lee
well,
that's
