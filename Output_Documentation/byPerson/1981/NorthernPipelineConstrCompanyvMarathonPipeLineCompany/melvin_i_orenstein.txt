mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
constitutional
challenge
which
is
raised
by
marathon
in
this
matter
is
based
upon
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
that
section
of
the
constitution
mandates
that
when
the
judicial
power
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
that
section
of
the
constitution
mandates
that
when
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
is
being
exercised,
the
judges
exercising
that
power
must
be
vested
with
the
salary
and
tenure
protections
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
the
bankruptcy
judges
serve
to
14
years.
their
salary
is
subject
to
diminution
by
act
of
congress.
they
exercise
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
independent
of
the
control
of
the
article
iii
court.
therefore,
the
exercise
of
their
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
based
upon
a
principle
that
the
commander
in
chief
has
a
power
to
discipline
his
forces.
now
that's
the
power
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
that
may
be,
but
your
honor
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
the
military
court
of
appeals?
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
but
i
think
that
those
--
in
the
case
--
the
case
you're
raising,
the
military
courts
and
the
tax
courts,
for
example,
i
think
they
fall
within
a
particular
category
of
cases
which
allow
the
--
allow
those
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
which
is
not
the
jurisdiction
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
there's
a
principle
that
this
court
has
developed
in
the
past
that
certain
kinds
of
power
is
susceptible
to
issue
determination,
but
in
the
first
instance,
it
may
be
exercised
by
the
executive
or
the
congress
because
that
department
can
exercise
that
power
independent
of
the
judicial
system.
for
example,
in
the
military
courts
situation,
i
think
it's
been
recognized
that
the
power
which
is
being
exercised
by
the
military
courts
in
the
first
instance
is
a
power
which
stems
from
the
power
of
the
commander-in-chief
to
discipline
his
forces.
that
doesn't
involve
the
determination
of
contract
rights
and
matters
of
national
application
as
you
have
in
the
bankruptcy
courts.
it's
a
very
narrowly
circumscribed
area,
it's
circumscribed
as
to
time
and
to
place.
and
i
think
that
that
principle
allows
congress
to
create
courts
outside
of
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
in
effect
your
honor,
the
kinds
--
the
kinds
of
values
that
are
protected
by
article
iii
are
the
separation
of
powers
at
the
federal
level
and
the
division
of
powers
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
when
those
powers
are
not
deemed
to
be
impaired
in
my
judgment,
then
congress
has
been
allowed
by
this
court
to
create
courts
outside
that
structure.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
i
think
that
anytime
that
you
have
state
created
rights
in
any
sense
that
once
you
create
--
once
you
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
--
because
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
on
the
other
hand
your
honor
if
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no,
but
i
think
that
--
what
that
would
lead
to
would
be
a
position
that
congress
could
establish.
those
kind
of
courts
outside
of
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
and
at
a
point,
you
would
begin
to
dilute
the
article
iii
power
to
appoint
where
the
courts
couldn't
serve
their
function.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
talking
about
the
kinds
of
cases
that
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
state
or
the
article
iii
district
courts.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
on
the
appeal
process
you
mean?
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
to
the
appeal
process.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
and
when
i'm
speaking
of
control
your
honor,
i'm
speaking
of
control
at
a
trial
level.
i
hardly
believe
that
the
appellate
review
system
would
--
would
justify
an
answer
to
article
iii.
if
that
would
--
you
know,
the
constitution
specifically
provides
that
both
the
judges
of
the
--
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
judges
of
the
inferior
court
must
be
vested
with
the
salary
and
tenure
protections.
it
would
even
--
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
would
lead
you
to
a
further
problem
with
the
district
court
judges
themselves.
if
you
could
--
if
you
could
take
the
position
that
an
appellate
review
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
under
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes,
under
rule
810
of
the
bankruptcy
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes,
that's
right.
but
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
questions
of
law
would
be
subject
to
review,
that's
correct.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
factfinding
process
is
the
important
process
which
is
involved
here.
and
that
to
--
in
some
way
take
the
position
that
that
process
--
if
it's
subject
to
review,
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
article
iii
values.
it
seems
to
me
as
to
ignore
the
reality
of
the
factfinding
process
of
--
and
its
impact
in
the
trial
situation.
and
--
and
i
--
i
just
can't
believe
that
the
appeal
process
is
the
kind
of
process
which
this
court
would
consider
as
a
satisfactory
to
meet
the
article
iii
--
or
the
delegation
standards
which
this
court
has
articulated
in
the
--
in
the
raddatz
case
in
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
--
in
united
states
against
raddatz.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
that's
right.
and
--
and
there's
a
further
problem,
in
the
bankruptcy
setting,
we
have
now
panels
of
bankruptcy
judges
that
are
set
up
as
an
appeal
court.
so
we
now
have
a
situation
where
you'd
have
to
take
two
appeals
in
order
to
get
to
an
article
iii
judge
and
it
seems
to
me
as
a
practical
matter
that
that
just
can't
--
in
most
cases
can't
happen.
it's
just
too
much
of
a
burden
to
require
people
to
take
two
appeals
to
get
to
an
article
iii
judge
to
get
the
kind
of
protection
that
the
article
iii
section
of
the
constitution
deems
to
be
so
important.
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
you
also
get
to
the
remand
problem.
if
you're
going
to
go
all
the
way
up,
you
will
ultimately
going
to
all
the
way
down
before
an
article
i
judge
who's
going
to
make
that
decision.
so
that
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
ultimately,
if
you
would
take
that
approach,
the
appeal
approach
to
satisfy
article
iii,
you
wind
up
with
an
article
i
judge
or
rather
a
none
out
of
the
three
officer
deciding
the
important
values
which
article
iii
was
designed
to
protect.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
all
right,
i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes,
okay
that's
true.
that's
true.
but
you
know
the
other
side
of
that
coin
your
honor
is
this.
the
--
the
principle
which
is
being
argued
in
this
case
is
that
in
the
name
of
convenience
and
expediency
that
we
ought
to
sacrifice
the
values
of
article
iii,
that's
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
expediency
and
need,
it
seems
to
be
in
one
case
is
the
same
in
a
sense
of
constitutional
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
that's
right.
i
guess
that's
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
your
honor,
i
think
wanted
to
be
clearer
on
something.
i
take
--
i
got
an
impression
that
the
government
here
is
taking
the
position
somehow
that
we're
attacking
the
entire
jurisdiction,
we're
attacking
the
entire
bankruptcy
court.
we're
not
doing
that
here.
we
understand
that
we
don't
want
to
dislocate
the
system,
that's
a
practical
problem.
on
the
other
hand,
of
course
we
think
there
are
certain
article
iii
values
that
ought
to
be
protected.
i
don't
believe
that
the
kind
of
problem
or
dislocation
you
may
be
concerned
about
would
occur
--
this
is
the
same
situation
which
had
occurred
or
existed
for
200
years.
these
same
cases
have
always
been
brought
before
the
article
iii
courts.
these
same
cases
had
always
been
tried
in
the
state
courts.
so
that
you
--
you
really
don't
--
there's
a
lot
of
horribles
perhaps
paraded
around
here
but
as
i
say,
this
is
a
situation
we've
existed
with
all
these
years.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
as
i
have
indicated
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
not
--
i
mean,
it's
not
a
question
of
convenience
in
my
judgment
to
assert
that
the
appeal
process
satisfies
the
control
of
relationships
which
have
to
exist
between
an
article
iii
court
and
its
delegate.
in
my
judgment,
in
effect,
you
have
an
article
i
officer
for
all
practical
purposes
deciding
the
final
rights
between
these
parties
and
there's
a
constitutional
provision
which
very
clearly
it
seems
to
me
says
that
both
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
inferior
courts
must
be
vested
with
the
salary
and
tenure
protections.
it
was
never
intended
i
think,
constitutionally
that
we
could
have
a
layer
of
federal
trial
courts
at
the
district
level
who
didn't
have
to
be
tenured.
it
seems
to
me
the
same
proposition
applies
and
when
congress
creates
inferior
federal
courts,
i
think
it's
required
by
constitutional
mandate
that
they
tenure
those
judges.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
i
really
don't
distinguish
it.
i
think
that
the
--
that
case
is
a
good
model
it
seems
to
me
for
what
we
have
here.
i
think
that
that
case
which
laid
down
two
broad
principles
as
i
understand
them.
the
principles
were
that
the
final
decision
has
to
be
made
by
the
article
iii
judge
and
secondly,
that
the
delegate
has
to
serve
the
magistrate,
the
non-article
officer
has
to
serve
an
advisory
subordinate
capacity
to
the
article
iii
judge.
that
is
what
the
article
iii
judge
must
have
complete
and
direct
control
of
the
activities
of
that
--
of
that
magistrate.
now,
in
the
magistrate's
cases
and
of
course
that
was
sustained.
the
delegation
of
power
in
that
case
was
sustained
and
it
seems
to
me
it
was
sustained
because
as
this
court
said,
there
was
complete
control
over
the
activities
of
that
--
an
article
iii
officer
and
the
court
did
make
the
final
decision.
none
of
that
is
present
here.
when
a
case
comes
into
the
bankruptcy
court,
it
starts
off
by
a
complaint.
it
goes
to
discovery.
it
goes
to
trial
by
jury
and
it
goes
into
judgment
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bank
--
the
article
iii
judge
never
gets
into
the
act.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes
sir.
they
can
try
cases
by
jury.
the
power
that
these
judges
can
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
pardon?
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes,
but
by
consent
as
i
understand
it.
yes
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
okay.
your
honor,
congress
didn't
make
this
an
article
i
court,
congress
didn't
intend
to
create
an
article
i
court.
congress
intended
to
create
an
article
iii
delegation
to
non-article
iii
officers
and
that's
the
question.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
your
honor.
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
set
aside
the
jurisdiction
represented
by
this
case
before
you.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes,
but
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
congress
can
create
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction,
unless
those
jurisdictional
basis
are
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution.
what
i
am
saying
is
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
--
there
are
limits
to
congress's
abilities
to
create
courts
and
to
confer
jurisdiction
upon
those
courts
and
this
case
involves
a
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no,
i
don't
think
it
could.
i
don't
think
it
can.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
okay.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
your
honor,
i
have
already
one
through
that
appeal
argument
and
i
supposed
you
may
or
may
not
be
persuaded
or
convinced.
it's
really
the
best
argument
i
can
make
is
that
the
constitution
is
very
specific
in
this
area
that
both
judges
on
the
--
on
the
appellate
level
and
on
the
basic
level
have
to
be
tenured
with
the
article
iii
protections.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
but
now
you're
getting
into
the
question
of,
“can
you
create
this
court
as
an
agency
with
all
of
these
kinds
of
powers
and
with
all
of
the
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
would
work
your
honor
because
--
whatever
label
you
put
on
something
doesn't
mean
anything
unless
you
--
you
look
at
what
it
does
and
what
it
can
do.
what
we're
saying
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
that
may
be
true.
i
--
i'm
not
entirely
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
but
you
have
a
different
principle
with
the
nlrb.
that
principle
is
based
upon
congress's
right
to
create
an
agency
and
that
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
this
court
has
long
ago
stated
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
factfinding
functions
which
can
be
delegated
to
an
agency,
and
that's
done
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
because
there
are
certain
areas
in
which
this
court
has
said
congress
can
make
this
kind
of
a
delegation
and
these
are
areas
involving
public
rights
where
a
sovereign
is
suing
to
enforce
a
particular
statute
under
a
federally
enacted
legislation.
there
are
certain
kinds
of
rights
that
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
okay,
then
if
it's
a
private
party's
situation
then
if
it's
a
private
parties
situation,
then
you
have
to
have
as
this
case
said
in
the
crowell
case.
you
must
have
a
relationship
between
that
factfinder
and
the
article
iii
court
which
is
a
properly
controlled
relationship
and
that's
what
we're
complaining
about
here
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no.
there
--
there
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
i
say,
don't
think
it
can.
because
this
court
has
stated
many
times
that
you
can't
take
private
rights,
contract
rights,
tort
rights
away
from
the
judicial
cognizance
if
you're
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
i
didn't
mean
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
when
it
creates
agencies?
yes,
i
didn't
intend
to
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
that's
correct.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
but
you
know,
now
your
honor,
you're
moving
into
a
whole
area
of
agency
factfinding
power
which
i
think
is
controlled
by
some
different
principles
--
to
the
kind
of
principle,
you're
trying
to
apply
here.
at
least
this
court
in
the
past
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
it's
a
--
it's
a
doctrine
which
this
court
has
announced
in
the
past.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
all
right.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
but
that's
under
--
that's
under
a
republic
statute
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
i
--
i
understand
it's
a
public
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
a
statute
which
confers
a
public
right
upon
the
individuals.
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
private
rights.
your
honors,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
were
to
employ
that
principle
that
you
can
take
private
rights
and
matters
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
matters
under
the
whole
range
of
federal
legislation
and
move
them
out
of
the
article
iii
protection
that
you've
in
effect
--
you've
nullified
the
article
iii
values.
and
it
seems
to
me,
this
could
has
very
carefully,
in
the
last
year
or
so
in
the
(inaudible)
case
articulated
and
affirmed
those
values
as
being
as
important
today
as
they
were
200
years
ago.
and
it
just
seems
to
be
that
if
you
consider
those
values
as
being
important
that
you
can't
allow
a
process
by
which
congress
can
erode
or
eat
away
those
kinds
--
in
to
the
article
iii
jurisdiction.
and
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
very
carefully
tried
to
develop
principles
which
would
avoid
that
problem.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
okay.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
the
label
does
not
make
any
difference
in
my
judgment.
it's
what
they
can
do
and
what
they
can't
do
that
makes
a
difference.
the
whole
magistrates
act
really
is
built
pretty
well
to
cover
the
problem.
the
magistrates
act
says
--
you
know,
the
article
iii
judges
got
the
power
to
refer
and
has
got
the
power
to
determine
what
kind
of
conditions
to
make
references.
he's
got
the
power
to
withdraw.
he's
got
the
power
to
accept,
modify,
reject,
and
take
new
evidence.
he
makes
rules
for
those
magistrates.
there's
a
whole
consent
package
which
protects
the
jury
rights
of
those
parties.
that's
the
kind
of
adjunct
relationship
that
should
have
been
created
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
reform
act
and
they
just
didn't
do
it.
they
didn't
have
the
time
and
i
think
there's
a
reason
for
it.
they
really
thought
that
this
was
a
separate
system
of
courts.
they
really
designed
it
that
way.
they
set
these
judges
up.
they
sit
on
the
conferences.
this
is
a
part
of
the
united
states.
it's
in
no
sense
an
aid
or
a
court
which
is
in
a
super
--
in
a
subordinate
position.
the
very
purpose
that
was
argued
before
congress
was
that
these
referees
had
to
be
raised
to
the
same
equal
rank
and
importance
as
the
article
iii
judges
and
they
started
out
with
that
concept
and
that's
what
they
got.
in
fact,
you
didn't
get
an
adjunct
for
it.
you
got
a
label
that
says
this
is
an
adjunct
court
but
that
court
itself
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
oh,
no.
i
don't
have
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
i
--
i
--
no,
my
only
point
is
that
there
are
certain
prescribed
standards
here
which
i
think
should
have
been
met
and
they
weren't
met
because
congress
just
didn't
get
it
all
together.
there
was
a
compromise.
if
they
were
going
to
create
an
adjunct
court,
adjunct
is
a
label,
it
really
doesn't
mean
anything.
adjunct
has
to
take
on
its
meaning
by
the
functions
which
this
article
iii
judges
can
perform
in
relation
to
the
level
or
the
supervision
of
the
article
iii
court.
adjunct
implies
a
subordinate
position,
an
adjunct
to
something.
this
court
is
not
an
adjunct
to
anything.
these
judges
make
the
final
decisions.
they
are
final
factfinders
and
the
only
time
that
you
can
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
they're
not
anymore
final
on
that
sense
but
they
exercise
different
powers.
they
can
try
jury
cases.
i
--
there
isn't
any
agency
i
know
that
tries
jury
cases.
there
aren't
any
agency
i
know
that
tissues
a
writ
of
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no,
i
think
that
gets
into
a
question
of
what
kinds
of
rights
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
and
in
--
under
the
act
which
you
suggest,
i
suspect
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes,
but
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes,
i
think
they
could
because
i
think
that
once
you
get
over
in
--
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
--
into
the
territories
then
you're
not
concerned
with
the
kinds
of
--
of
separation
of
powers.
you've
got
a
plenary
power
in
congress
to
legislate
over
those
areas.
you
don't
have
a
competing
judiciary.
you
don't
have
a
competing
state
sovereign.
those
kinds
kind
of
values
which
article
iii
attempts
to
protect,
the
whole
problem
of
encroachment
of
federal
power
is
not
at
issue
in
the
territories
because
congress
has
the
plenary
power
under
those
circumstances
to
legislate.
it
can
act
both
as
a
state
and
as
a
sovereign
if
it
so
chooses
because
it
was
given
that
power
specifically
under
the
constitution.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
well,
in
the
due
process
sense,
certainly
so.
in
the
structural
problem,
in
a
structural
sense,
it's
not
the
same
problem.
there's
a
tendency
to
confuse
the
two.
the
structural
problem
really
--
the
constitution
was
designed
to
do
a
certain
thing
and
that
was
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
alliance
between
the
non-article
iii
judges
and
the
congress
which
would
at
some
way
allow
the
federal
programs
to
be
applied
in
prejudice
to
the
rights
of
the
states
and
the
--
and
the
individuals
or
litigants
who
have
those
rights
conferred
upon
them
by
the
state
laws.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
yes.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
your
honor,
first
let
me
say
that
i'm
not
asking
that
we
go
as
far
as
judge
lord
went.
he
struck
down
the
entire
quantum
of
jurisdiction
and
i
--
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
focus
of
this
case
is
--
is
narrower.
but
in
--
i
--
you
know,
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
struck
down
jurisdictional
exercises,
for
example,
the
o'callahan
versus
parker
case.
and
there
--
and
there
was
a
bankruptcy
case
by
the
way
called
chicot
county
drainage
district
versus
baxter
bank
in
which
the
bankruptcy
court
jurisdiction
was
struck
down
exactly
the
same
kind
of
problem
we
have
here.
and
the
court
held
it
on
collateral
attack
when
another
creditor
tried
to
bring
it
up
in
a
later
suit
that
it
was
res
judicata.
and
so
those
cases,
all
the
cases
that
have
gone
to
judgment
and
so
on
are
res
judicata.
insofar
as
the
retroactivity
or
the
prospectively,
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
treated
that
issue,
one
was
(inaudible)
and
there
are
some
others
where
this
court
has
in
effect,
it
took
the
o'callahan
case
and
where
that
jurisdiction
had
been
knocked
out
and
said
that
that
case
would
not
apply
retroactively
will
applied
prospectively.
so
i
feel
this
court
has
left
itself
plenty
of
room
in
this
area
to
work
out
those
kind
of
problems
so
as
not
to
result
in
any
major
dislocations.
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no,
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
that
at
all?
mr.
melvin
i.
orenstein
no.
thank
you
your
honor.
