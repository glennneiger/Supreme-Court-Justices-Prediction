justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
general,
that
any
time
congress
has
granted
a
specific
authority
to
legislate,
it
has
the
authority
to
create
a
special
system
of
courts
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
do
you
distinguish?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
i
stop
you
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
specialized
area,
do
you
mean
an
area
where
the
judges
in
filling
the
courts
will
have
a
specialized
competence
in
a
particular
branch
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
seems
that
you
will
have
real
trouble
with
this
statute
because
the
jurisdiction
vested
in
the
bankruptcy
judges
just
covers
the
gamut
of
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
present
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
one
distinction
between
this
and
palmore
is
that
palmore
dealt
with
an
area
of
67
square
miles
and
this
covers
the
whole
country.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
palmore
is
more
like
canter
in
that
respect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
it
would
be
something
improper
about
the
court
of
military
appeals
upholding
a
death
sentence
if
congress
had
authorized
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
devney,
do
you
think
we
can
decide
this
case
by
saying,
“yes,
congress
could
authorize
the
bankruptcy
court
to
decide
a
contract
case
and
will
wait
until
the
next
case
to
decide
whether
that
(inaudible)
tort
case
or
not?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
--
we
have
to
have
some
fairly
generalized
principle
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
can
decide
contract,
tort,
antitrust,
and
a
number
of
other
things
that
might
“pertain
to”
the
bankruptcy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
but
because
it's
convenient
doesn't
make
it
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
these
judges
empanel
a
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
by
the
court
of
appeals?
