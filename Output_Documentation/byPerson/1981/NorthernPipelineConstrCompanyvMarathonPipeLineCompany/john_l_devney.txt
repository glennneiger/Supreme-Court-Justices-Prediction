mr.
john
l.
devney
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
obviously,
our
position
coincides
with
that
of
solicitor
general.
i
would
hope
that
i
would
not
have
to
repeat
what
he
has
said
about
some
of
the
areas
however
i'm
certainly
available
for
questions.
i'd
like
to
address
the
issue
more
in
terms
of
not
bankruptcy
but
the
question
of
whether
we're
dealing
with
an
article
iii
court
as
opposed
to
an
article
i
or
a
legislative
court.
and
in
that
regard,
and
i
think
this
is
--
obviously,
the
solicitor's
position,
it's
our
view
that
we're
dealing
with
the
properly
constituted
legislative
court.
now,
early
in
this
argument,
justice
rehnquist
asked,
i
believe,
what
the
limits
were
on
congress
for
the
creation
of
legislative
courts.
history
provides
us
with
some
idea
of
that,
but
at
least
there's
a
lawyer
who's
read
this
rather
difficult
cases
several
times.
the
only
true
answer
to
that
is,
“i
don't
know.”
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
devney
i
think
that
there
is.
i
think
the
--
we
know
that
the
outer
limits
of
that
power
is
the
existence
of
an
enumerated
power
in
article
i.
i
think
the
limitation,
although
i
agree
that
palmore
sets
up
a
condition
that
may
have
been
appropriate
in
palmore.
i
don't
think
it
represents
the
outer
limits
of
congress's
ability
to
set
up
article
iii
courts.
but
as
to
how
far
congress
can
go,
i
cannot
literally
formulate
that
preposition
for
this
court.
i
can
say
and
i
do
say
that
the
bankruptcy
court
does
not
represent
a
step
past
the
outer
limits.
mr.
john
l.
devney
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
l.
devney
i
do
because
the
--
mr.
john
l.
devney
pardon
me?
mr.
john
l.
devney
well,
in
both
houses
were
aware
of
the
distinction.
mr.
john
l.
devney
well,
that's
--
that's
obviously
what
their
statute
said.
and
i
think
although
it's
inelegant,
i
think
we
see
a
belt
and
suspenders
approach
to
the
--
to
the
old
question.
mr.
john
l.
devney
no.
they
purported
--
mr.
john
l.
devney
they
--
they
deposited
jurisdiction
initially
in
an
article
iii
court
and
then
automatically
delegated
--
delegated
it
to
an
article
i
court.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
john
l.
devney
i
sure
do,
i
think
that's
what
the
statute
very
plainly
says.
mr.
john
l.
devney
in
the
house
of
representative
as
--
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
--
the
point
that
i
think
is
important
to
recognize
here
is
that
when
we
talk
about
canter,
when
we
talk
about
palmore,
when
we
talk
about
the
territories,
we're
talking
about
something
that's
rather
anomalous
if
we
--
if
we
reflect
on
it
for
a
moment
is
--
and
i
think
the
anomaly
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
people
tend
to
think
of
the
article
iii
judicial
requirements
only
in
terms
of
what's
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs
here
as
federalism.
but
article
iii
is
something
more
than
federalism,
it's
a
guarantee
to
the
citizens
of
this
country
whether
they're
citizens
of
a
state
or
of
a
territory
that
in
certain
circumstances,
i.e.
a
case
falling
within
the
federal
judicial
power,
they're
entitled
to
a
federal
judge
enjoying
article
iii
protections.
now,
given
that
set
of
circumstances
and
certainly
marshall
understood
that.
when
he
decided
canter,
he
had
no
trouble
at
all
saying,
“however,
if
it's
a
valid
article
i
exercise,
we
need
not
have
an
article
iii
judiciary.”
now,
i
think
that's
important
because
i
think
there's
a
tendency
to
say,
“well,
we're
only
talking
about
the
territories
and
who
cares
about
those
folks?”
in
addition
to
that,
we
can
talk
about
the
court
of
military
appeals.
and
now
we're
no
longer
in
the
territories.
now,
we're
talking
about
a
court
that
operates
nationally,
that
operates
at
least
theoretically
in
every
state
in
the
union.
this
is
a
court
that
at
least,
fortunately
now
at
the
present
i
am
led
to
believe,
but
at
least
in
the
past,
has
been
able
to
declare
a
sentences
of
death
certainly
today
and
deprive
a
man
of
his
liberty.
mr.
john
l.
devney
no,
not
at
all,
but
they're
article
i
judges.
mr.
john
l.
devney
my
point
is,
is
that
that
is
not
the
distinction
between
article
i
and
article
iii.
the
nature
of
the
offense,
the
gravity
of
the
crime
play
no
role
in
the
distinction
between
article
i
and
article
iii.
mr.
john
l.
devney
or
perhaps
--
perhaps
so,
sir.
but
stopping
to
reflect
on
--
on
this
point,
here,
we're
talking
about
a
breach
of
contract
case.
and
the
defendant
in
this
breach
of
contract
case
has
said,
“i'm
entitled
to
an
article
iii
judge.”
given
--
because
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
is
a
federal
question
and
would
or
might
otherwise
fall
within
the
federal
judicial
power.
it's
certainly
isn't
any
more
a
substantial
question
in
any
of
those
addressed
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
also
operates
throughout
the
states.
and
i
think
what
we
can
say
is
and
something
that
this
court
has
always
recognized,
is
that
federal
questions
need
not
be
decided
by
article
iii
courts
but
can
be
decided
by
article
i
courts
as
well,
and
of
course
that's
obvious
because
that's
all
legislative
courts
or
article
i
courts
of
this
nation
have
ever
done.
mr.
john
l.
devney
no.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
a
basis
to
choose
if
you
decide
this
case.
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
devney
well,
i
think
you
--
the
generalized
principle
is
that
this
is
a
validly
constituted
article
i
court.
mr.
john
l.
devney
sure
it
can
but
only
if
there's
a
bankruptcy.
and
that's
--
that's
the
key
to
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
devney
oh
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
l.
devney
well,
you
might
be
able
to
and
i
--
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
is
jurisdiction
under
title
11,
yes,
sir.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
