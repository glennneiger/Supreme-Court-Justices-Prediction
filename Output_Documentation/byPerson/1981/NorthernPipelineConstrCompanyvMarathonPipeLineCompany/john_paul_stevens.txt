justice
john
paul
stevens
well
taking
this
very
case
for
a
moment,
before
the
statute
was
passed,
could
the
bankruptcy
referee
have
entered
a
binding
judgment
in
this
particular
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
did
not
consent
they
could
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
clear
that
the
non-article
iii
judge
does
have
the
--
you
don't
have
any
problem
with
him
entering
a
binding
judgment
in
a
matter
depending
on
state
law
between
private
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
--
is
there
any
precedent
for
that
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
even
resolving
the
dispute
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
is,
“no”.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
suppose
you
could
broaden
the
definition
of
the
reorganization
to
include
quite
a
variety
of
things,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
orenstein,
isn't
there
another
consideration?
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
statute
but
supposing
nobody
ever
takes
an
appeal,
isn't
it
possible
that
the
acts
of
the
bankruptcy
judges
and
the
bankruptcy
courts
will
have
the
force
and
effect
of
a
--
of
a
regular
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
award
got
any
legal
effect
until
the
court
enters
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
do
they
have
to
petition
an
article
iii
judge
to
get
it
enforced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
affirm
one
thing.
you
don't
go
so
far
as
to
adopt
justice
jackson's
rationale
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
in
the
tidewater
case.
