justice
byron
r.
white
right,
and
then
what,
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
--
we
have
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
congress
proceeded
on
this
basis
on
an
article
iii
basis,
i
mean
on
the
--
on
the
legislative
court
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
said
both
houses
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
both
houses
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
both
houses
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
they
were
--
thought
they
were
approaching
it
on
an
article
iii
basis
was
these
--
these
kinds
of
judges
as
being
an
adjunct
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
they
purported
to
create
an
article
iii
--
article
iii
courts,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
article
iii
officers
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
they
thought
that's
what
they
were
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
by
bankruptcy
you
would
include
a
chapter
11
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
they
could
--
you
could
have
a
special
--
an
article
i
court
to
decide
every
case
arising
under
one
of
the
bill
of
rights,
one
of
the
amendments,
one
of
the
first
10
amendments?
what
does
it
say?
how
about
the
first
--
just
a
first
amendment
court,
an
article
i,
first
amendment
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
involve
separation
of
powers
between,
necessarily
between
in
the
federal
government
or
wouldn't
involve
any
questions
of
federalism?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
what
about
the
--
the
first
amendment
only
applied
for
a
long
time
when
they
applied
it
to
the
federal
government
and
suppose
there
were
some
act
of
congress
that
was
attacked
as
violative
of
the
first
amendment
but
we
have
a
special
article
i
court
decide
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
a
separation
of
powers
question,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
it's
just
a
federalism
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
--
could
you
tell
me
--
just
summarize,
what
kind
of
matters
did
you
say
these
--
new
bankruptcy
judges
may
decide
that
are
beyond
the
control
of
any
higher
court
of
the
district
court
or
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that
but
they
are
now
--
can
be
--
but
what
matters
are
finely
decided
in
the
new
bankruptcy
courts
that
are
not
subject
to
control
by
the
district
court
or
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
said
that
your
fundamental
objection
was
that
these
courts
can
now
finally
decide
things
that
article
iii
judges
have
no
control
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
standard
of
review
on
facts?
is
it
clearly
erroneous?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
is,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
article
--
no
article
iii
judges
on
review
can
upset
factfindings
unless
they're
clearly
erroneous,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
all
questions
of
law
are
subject
to
being
reviewed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
don't
call
them
judges?
what
about
administrators?
what
about
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
example,
you
can't
upset
their
factfindings
either
if
they're
supported
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
substantial
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
doesn't
--
all
you're
doing
--
arguably
all
you're
doing
is
changing
the
name
on
--
on
the
organization.
you
don't
call
it
a
court,
you
call
it
an
agency
and
if
all
members
of
the
board
or
administrators
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
let
me
just
--
you
know
what
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
do,
they
can
--
they
can
make
determinations
of
unfair
labor
practices
and
give
an
award
in
back
pay
in
very,
very
large
amounts.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
--
that
maybe
true
but
when
they
petition
for
enforcement
the
article
iii
court
has
no
authority
to
upset
any
factfinding
that
is
--
that
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
in
this
bankruptcy
court,
nothing
is
final
if
somebody
wants
to
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
they
get
that,
to
mean
--
to
decide
these
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
the
kind
of
--
what's
--
what's
the
matter
with
delegating
pursuant
to
the
bank
--
the
bankruptcy
power,
the
that
of
factfinding
that
is
delegated
to
these
bankruptcy
judges.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
the
sovereign
isn't
suing
for
anything
under
the
national
labor
relations
board,
private
parties
litigate
before
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
as
the
--
the
sovereign
is
enforcing
its
own
laws,
it
can
--
it
can
create
anything
it
wants
to
--
have
the
disputes
adjudicated
by
any
kind
of
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
--
what
is
it
that
--
what
is
that
different
principle?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
file
it
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
you
want
to
get
reparations
from
another
party,
so
here's
a
--
so
here's
a
dispute
between
a
shipper
and
a
carrier
and
the
court
and
they
--
and
reparations
are
awarded.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
$1
million
--
worth
a
$1
million.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
a
public
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
stands
the
argument
on
its
head.
you
would
think
that
if
they
can
--
if
they
can
award
back
pay
and
reparations
without
a
jury,
you'd
think
it'd
be
even
more
invalid
but
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
get
a
money
award.
you
get
a
money
award
for
having
fired
somebody
illegally,
that
sounds
pretty
legal,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
mr.
orenstein,
in
your
home
state
of
minnesota,
you
had
a
territorial
federal
court
at
one
time
and
--
but
let
me
get
in
a
--
let
me
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down
and
i'd
like
to
have
your
comment
on.
this
act
has
been
in
effect
for
a
little
while.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
certainly,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
related
proceedings
that
have
gone
down
the
--
through
the
process.
your
chief
judge
lord's
opinion
should
be
or
judgment
should
be
affirmed
here.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
how
the
unconstitutionality
can
be
cured
with
all
of
these
things
in
the
background?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
to
operate
prospectively
or
all
these
proceedings
rendered
null
and
void?
