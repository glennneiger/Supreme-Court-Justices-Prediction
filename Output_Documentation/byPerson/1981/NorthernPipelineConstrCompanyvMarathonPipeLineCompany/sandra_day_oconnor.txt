do
you
think
a
special
area
language,
generally
might
refer
to
a
geographical
area
rather
than
--
justice

yes,
but
then
when
you
graft
onto
that,
the
jurisdiction
over
this
wide
range
of
other
cases
is
where
you
get
into
the
problem.
i
assume
under
the
act
that
can
even
cover
a
marital
dissolution
cases
in
state
courts
(voice

(voice

virtually
to
limit.

and
general

lee
on
this
point,
i
mean
if
we
were
to
focus
primarily
on
article
i,
its
article
i
that
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
constitute
tribunals
inferior
to
this
court.

o'connor
so
if
you
were
to
rely
on
that,
than
any
lower
court
judge
could
be
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
when
then
you
run
into
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
too.
so
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
to
rely
on
article
i
would
lead
us
into
a
lot
of
difficulty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
thank
you.
