mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
begin
by
parsing
california's
arguments
and
the
strange
and
odd
premise
on
which
it
is
constructed,
and
the
odd
results
to
which
it
leads.
california
would
have
you
hold
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
on
which
it
places
its
entire
reliance
save
only
for
the
"made"
land
provision
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
does
not
vest
indefeasible
title
in
the
tidelands
along
the
open
shore
as
against
erosion
by
the
sea,
but
that
it
does
vest
indefeasible
state
title
with
respect
to
uplands
extended
by
accretion.
california
would
have
you
hold
that
the
seaward
boundary
of
the
tidelands
is
governed
by
federal
law,
whereas
the
landward
boundary
of
those
same
tidelands
is
governed
by
state
law.
california
would
have
you
hold
that
the
seaward
boundary
is
ambulatory,
regardless
of
any
state
law
rule
to
the
contrary,
but
that
the
landward
boundary
is
frozen
if
the
state
so
chooses,
and
here
california
has
gone
halfway.
washington,
as
the
court
knows
from
hughes
versus
washington,
has
gone
the
whole
way.
that
is,
any
accretions,
natural
or
otherwise,
have
no
effect
in
giving
accretions
to
the
upland
owner.
but
even
those
contradictions
are
not
the
end
of
it.
the
landward
boundary
itself,
according
to
california,
is
not
frozen
when
erosion
occurs.
that
part
of
the
upland
which
was
shoreward
of
the
tidelands
when
it
is
lost
to
the
sea
does
not
remain
with
the
upland
owner.
now,
the
rationale
of
this
submission
by
california
is
self-contradictory.
california
successfully
argued
in
this
court
some
years
ago
that
the
federal
title
to
the
submerged
lands
before
the
submerged
lands
act
has
to
be
logically
restricted
to
that
area
actually
submerged,
because
the
paramount
rights
of
the
united
states
were
related
to
navigation--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
is
the
california
rule,
though
interestingly
the
california
courts
do
not
apply
this
rule
to
federal
lands,
or
even
to
lands
derived
from
federal
grants,
but
it
is
the
california
law
and--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
it
is
the
general
california
law.
the
california
courts
have
not
to
date,
but
if
they
were
free
to
do
so,
perhaps
would
apply
it
to
federal
uplands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
don't
know
what
the
california
courts--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
may
be
because
of
the
hughes
case.
it
may
be
because
of
the
bonelli
case,
but
at
all
events,
i
take
it
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
california
rule,
if
it
were
free
to
apply
it,
would
apply
it
even
to
federal
uplands.
it
is
right,
mr.
justice
white,
that
this
is
the
california
law.
the
question
is
whether
that
california
law
producing
these
inconsistent
results
ought
to
be
deemed
the
applicable
rule
with
respect
to
tidelands.
it
is
a
very
greedy
rule,
because
it
seeks
to
get
the
best
of
both
worlds.
on
the
one
hand,
it
invokes
corvallis
for
the
proposition
that
title
to
tidelands
is
frozen
as
of
statehood,
but
not
content
with
that,
because
in
this
case
that
would
win
california
only
a
very
narrow
strip
of
the
parcel
involved,
since
most
of
this
land
was
submerged
at
statehood,
california
then
invokes
bonelli
for
the
proposition
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
grants
continually
as
time
progresses,
long
after
statehood,
any
lands
which
acquire
the
character
of
tidelands.
no
case
in
this
court
has
remotely
suggested
that
this
acquisitive
doctrine,
which
works
in
only
one
direction,
ought
to
be
condoned.
now,
as
applied
to
lands
of
the
united
states,
the
california
submission
produces
this
strange
result,
which
is
that
although
the
united
states
expressly
reserves
for
purposes
connected
with
its
maritime
access
lands
along
the
coast
defined
in
the
reservation
as
lots
which
in
turn
are
defined
as
bounded
by
the
high
water
mark,
as
california
itself
describes
those
lots,
they
meandered,
and
they
are
meant
to
move,
so
one
would
suppose
from
the
fact
that
the
seaward
boundary
is...
the
united
states
having
reserved
this
area
for
a
maritime
purpose,
it
can,
through
imposition
of
a
california
state
rule,
which
doesn't
happen
to
be
as
greedy
as
washington's
state
rule,
but
the
principle
is
the
same,
can
be
deprived
of
its
access
to
the
sea.
that
may
or
may
not
matter
in
this
particular
case,
because
there
happens
to
be
access
on
the
other
side
in
humboldt
bay,
but
the
principle
the
court
is
deciding
would
be
the
same
even
if
the
only
access
to
what
might
be
a
naval
base
were
on
the
coast
of
california
and
a
state
law
rule
deprived
it
of
the
accretions
that
formed
in
front
of
it.
now,
this,
we
suggest,
something--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--mr.
justice
white--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
would
be
hughes.
now,
we
suggest
that
these
anomalies,
these
odd
results
can
be
avoided
in
one
of
three
different
ways.
the
first,
and
simplest,
is
for
this
court
to
adhere
to
its
hughes
decision,
which
applies
not
only
to
land
still
held
by
the
united
states
but
to
lands
granted
by
the
united
states,
in
other
words,
not
to
apply
the
corvallis
rule
to
the
open
coast,
as
corvallis
itself
hesitated
to
do.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
hughes
were
adhered
to,
it
disposes
of
this
case,
as
i
think
my
opponents
conceded.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
one
way
in
which
the
court
can
most
simply
avoid
the
incongruities
which
i
have
outlined.
the
second,
if
there
is
a
logical
inconsistency
between
the
survival
of
hughes
and
the
survival
of
the
corvallis
doctrine,
i
would
invite
the
court
to
question
whether
the
right
of
accretions
as
added
to
uplands
which
have
been
universally
recognized
from
roman
times
through
english
law
through
all
american
law
until
very
recently
in
some
few
states
as
appertaining
to
the
upland-lowland,
is
not
one
of
those
property
rights,
right
of
private
property,
which
no
state
can
defease
without
violating
the
just
compensation
clause.
that
is
assuming
that
state
law
applies.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
perhaps
upon
its
admission
to
the
union,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
california
or
any
other
state
has
ever
adopted
such
a
rule
that
far
back.
indeed,
here,
i
invoke
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
stewart
in
the
hughes
case.
washington
changed
its
law
in
1966,
and
justice
stewart
said
to
allow
that
to
destroy
property
vested
at
statehood
in
the
predecessor
of
mrs.
hughes
would
violate
the
just
compensation
clause,
and
accordingly,
they
had
a
judgment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
would
be
the
third
way
in
which
the
court
can
avoid
these
anomalies,
that
is,
to
follow
the
rule
of
wilson,
which
was
simply
an
application
of
the
general
rule
that
federal
law
controls
the
boundaries
of
federal
land.
whether
to
borrow
state
land
is
therefore
the
only
question
if
one
takes
this
approach,
now,
in
wilson
the
court
found
it
appropriate
to
do
so.
here,
i
would
invite
the
court
to
turn
to
the
submerged
lands
act
as
the
federal
rule
of
decision.
section
5
of
the
submerged
lands
act
very
explicitly
and
plainly
says
that
when
the
united
states
reserves
lands,
it
reserves
it
together
with
the
accretions
thereto.
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
confect
a
common
law
rule
for
this
purpose.
we
turn
to
the
rule
which
congress
itself
has
enacted,
and
very
appropriately,
in
this
very
context.
we
apply
that
federal
law
enacted
by
congress
as
the
rule
of
decision,
and
do
not
borrow
state
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
congress
has
done
precisely
that
in
section
5
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
has
that
authority
only
if
no
constitutional
rule
barred
the
way,
and
here,
with
respect
to
tidelands,
there
was
no
constitutional
rule
announced
by
this
court
to
the
effect
that
accretions
which
occur
along
the
open
coast
belong
to
the
states,
and
therefore
congress
was
free
to
make
disposition
accordingly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
suppose
that
congress
can
overrule
corvallis.
corvallis,
as
i
appreciate
it,
has
two
parts.
insofar
as
it
rests
on
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
it
does
not
for
the
most
part
aid
california
here,
because
corvallis
holds
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
fully
spent
at
statehood,
and
most
of
these
lands
did
not
become
tidelands,
much
less
uplands,
until
long
after
statehood.
most
of
them
were
submerged,
and
therefore
not
sovereign
lands
of
california,
therefore
not
vested
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
but
california
reads
the
equal
footing
doctrine
notwithstanding
corvallis
as
granting
more,
as
continual
grant,
as
indeed
it
is
fair
to
say
it
appears
congress
read
the
equal
footing
doctrine
in
1953,
because
it
very
plainly
made
an
ambulatory
grant.
the
courts
up
to
that
time,
most
read
it,
including
members
of
this
court,
as
late
as
1973,
read
the
equal
footing
doctrine
as
merely
an
ambulatory
grant,
which
was
of
some
advantage
to
the
states,
in
that
it
vested
title
to
newly
formed
navigable
water
bottoms,
whereas
under
the
court's
holding
in
corvallis,
that
is
not
true,
and
yet
corvallis
did
hold
in
favor
of
oregon
with
respect
to
a
newly
formed
bed,
but
not
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
now,
if
that
aspect
of
corvallis,
we
suggest,
ought
not
be
made
applicable
to
the
coast,
and
indeed
corvallis
itself,
and
no
single
decision
of
this
court
has
ever
doubted
that
accretions
as
opposed
to
the
effect
of
evulsions,
that
accretions
did
not
innure
to
the
upland
owner.
indeed,
the
decisions
quoted
in
corvallis
pointed
out
that
this
is
the
universal
rule.
the
only
question
in
those
cases
was
with
respect
to
title
to
manmade
land
or
what
happens
in
the
case
of
unusual
evulsions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
corvallis,
even
in
the
period
of
erie,
state
property
law
rules
were
generally
thought
to
be
an
exception
to
the
federal
common
law,
but
the
court
seemed
to
be
understanding
that
the
right
to
naturally
formed
accretions
is
a
property
right,
which
no
state
can
take
without
compensation.
hence,
that
universal
rule,
which
was
indeed
english
law,
american
law,
federal
common
law,
and
the
common
law
of
all
the
states
at
the
time
went
unquestioned,
and
to
change
that
rule
in
the
1940's,
the
1950's,
the
1960's,
does
present
a
constitutional
problem--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
am
not
expert
in
california
law,
but
it
appears
that
in
the
briefs
filed
by
california
in
the
1950's
in
connection
with
number
5
and
number
6
original,
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
no
decision
before
1944
is
cited
as
upholding
this
unusual
rule
that
what
would
in
federal
law
be
viewed
as
naturally
formed
accretions
will
not
in
the
case
of
california
be
so
viewed,
alter
the
interest
of...
as
california
put
it
in
1951...
the
exceptional
situation
of
beaches
formed
along
the
california
coast.
we
rest
on
our
written
submission
with
respect
to
the
arguments
made
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
let
me
simply
make
this
point
about
the
submerged
lands
act
argument.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
these
lands
are
not
made,
filled
in,
or
reclaimed
lands
within
the
meaning
of
the
provision
invoked
by
california,
but...
and
we
have
recited
the
legislative
history
to
demonstrate
that
no
such
indirectly
formed
natural
accretions
were
aimed
at
by
that
provision
of
the
act...
the
general
rule
of
the
submerged
lands
act
is
one
granting
an
ambulatory
boundary
of
dealing
only
with
lands
at
any
given
time
submerged
or
washed
by
the
tide,
not
uplands,
not
accredited
lands,
and
indeed,
the
very
definition
says,
as
heretofore
or
hereafter
modified
by
accretion,
reliction,
and
erosion,
very
clearly
an
ambulatory
grant,
as
everyone
understood
water
boundaries
generally
were
at
the
time.
but
even
if
we
should
be
wrong,
that
made
land
arguably
does
cover
our
case,
in
the
particular
situation
of
the
united
states's
upland,
section
5
of
the
submerged
lands
act
makes
clear
that
such
lands
will
not
innure
to
the
state,
are
not
confirmed
in
the
state,
but
on
the
contrary,
when
made
by
the
united
states,
as
in
the
case
of
this
land
allegedly,
appertain
to
the
upland
united
states
reservation,
and
it
also
makes
clear
in
a
provision
which
we
think
governs
here,
that
accretions
to
reserved
lands
of
the
united
states
are
included
in
the
reservation,
and
in
that
respect,
the
submerged
lands
act
document
in
our
view
fails.
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court,
i
am
done.
