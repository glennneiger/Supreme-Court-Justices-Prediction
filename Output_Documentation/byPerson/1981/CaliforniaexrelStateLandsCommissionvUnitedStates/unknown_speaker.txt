unknown

the
state
has
not
been
exactly
consistent.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
not
abandoned
a
single
part
of
any
of
your
claims.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
not
asserting
any
estoppel
principle
against
the
united
states
for
having
applied--
unknown
speaker
--would
this
case
be
here
if
that
movement
on
the
part
of
the
admiral
out
there
had
not
taken
place?
unknown
speaker
has
the
watchtower
ever
been
built?
unknown
speaker
otherwise,
are
the
subject
lands
used
for
any
purpose?
unknown
speaker
and
they
do
not
in
any
wise
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
coast
guard
site?
unknown
speaker
and
do
we
know
whether
the
united
states
has
any
plans
for
its
use?
unknown
speaker
mr.
flushman,
as
i
understand
it,
the
coast
guard
reservation
was
acquired
by
the
federal
government
after
california
had
become
a
state.
unknown
speaker
and
the
formal
withdrawal
by
the
united
states
of
the
parcel
for
the
purposes
of
building
a
lighthouse
originally?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
terms
or
provisions
in
the
withdrawal
that
would
affect
any
rights
that
the
united
states
would
have
reserved
for
the
tidelands?
unknown
speaker
right.
that
is
why
it's
hard
to
interpret
them.
unknown
speaker
down
to
the
low
water
mark?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
california
owned
the
lands
and
the
seabed
before
california?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
california
held.
unknown
speaker
what
the
ownership
had
always
been.
unknown
speaker
determined
what
the
ownership
had
always
been.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
the
result
of
what
some
court
should
hold,
but
that
is
not
what
either
the
act
or
the
case
required.
unknown
speaker
restore?
unknown
speaker
restore,
or
to
cede?
what
language
did
it
use?
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
use
restore.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
really
aren't
suggesting,
are
you,
that
the
california
case
said
that
the
united
states
was
taking
property
that
did
not
belong
to
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you
are
wrong?
that
really
isn't
your
basic
claim
in
this
case,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
it
isn't
critical
to
your--
unknown
speaker
--why
wouldn't
you
submit
the
same
rule
would
apply
to
accretions
on
your
tidelands
if
they
didn't
occur
artificially?
unknown
speaker
so...
all
right.
in
this
case,
if
it
were
decided
that
these
were
natural
rather
than
artificially
caused
accretions,
what
would
the
california
law
be?
unknown
speaker
so
a
critical
factor
in
this
case
is
whether
these
are
natural
or
artificial?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
even...
under
your
submission,
even
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
it
isn't,
is
it
controlling
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
claiborne,
it
nevertheless
is
the
california
rule,
isn't
it?
however
contradictory
it
may
be,
it
is
the
rule.
it
may
be
that
you
are
going
to
argue
that
there
is
a
federal
rule
that
supervenes,
i
suppose,
but
it
is
the
california
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
isn't
the
california
rule
applicable
in
these
circumstances?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
because
of
the
hughes
case.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
because
of
the
hughes
case?
unknown
speaker
so
you
suggest
then
that
you
aren't
necessarily
deciding
what
the
result
would
be
here
if
the
united
states
had
patented
the
land
to
a
private
party?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
hughes,
i
suppose,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
that
i
caught
your
response
to
my
brother
white,
mr.
claiborne.
did
you
say
that
you
think
hughes
disposes
of
this
case
unless
it
is
overruled?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
did,
too.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
a
state
would
not
be
free
upon
its
admission
to
the
union
to
adopt
a
different
rule
than
that?
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
room
to
distinguish
between
private
uplands
and
public
uplands?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
congress
could
pass
a
general
law
somewhat
like
the
submerged
lands
act
except
applicable
to
all
50
states
saying,
in
effect,
that
we
reserve
such
and
such
lands
when
they
are
connected
to
land
owned
by
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
authority
does
it
have
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
congress
could
overrule
the
decision
in
corvallis
by
simply
passing
a
statute
that
said
state
rules
of
decision
along
inland
waters
shall
not
divest
the
federal
government
of
property
which
it
owns
along
those
waters
except
on
conditions
that
congress
lays
down?
unknown
speaker
most
of
those
decisions,
though,
were
in
the
pre-erie
days,
were
they
not,
when
the
court
was
simply
laying
down...
following
its
own
notion
of
common
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
had
california
in
its
decision
or
law
had
a
different
rule
prior
to
the
carpenter
case,
so
that
in
effect
there
was
a
change
of
decisional
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
lovingston
against
st.
clair
something
in
the
mississippi
river?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
they
use
a
new
york
case?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
on
the...
i
take
it
that
does
not
cover
your
argument
on
the
submerged
land
act.
unknown
speaker
now,
on
that
statute,
what
is
your
response...
i
just
may
not
recall
it...
to
the
argument
about
section
5
of
the
submerged
land
act,
that
in
any
event
there
is
an
exception
for
accretion
to...
united
states
lands
including
accretions
thereto?
