mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
choice
of
law
case
arises
under
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
california
was
granted
leave
to
file
a
complaint
seeking
to
acquire
title
to
certain
coastal
lands
which
under
undisputed
california
law
belong
to
the
state.
the
matter
is
now
before
the
court
on
california's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
united
states
cross-motion
for
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
at
its
heart,
this
case
concerns
the
federal
system
defining
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
national
sovereign.
the
issue
is
whether
the
united
states
can
interfere
with
fundamental
state
sovereign
attributes
long
recognized
by
this
court
that
state
law
decides
conflicts
over
state
sovereign
lands.
here,
if
the
united
states
were
not
the
upland
owner,
it
would
be
unquestioned
but
that
california
would
own
the
disputed
land.
the
result
should
not
differ
merely
because
the
united
states
is
that
owner.
the
facts
are
few
and
are
not
contested.
before
the
late
1880's,
the
disputed
land
lay
north
of
the
entrance
channel
to
humboldt
bay,
california,
and
below
the
ordinary
high
water
mark
along
the
coast
guard
site.
in
the
late
1880's,
two
rubble
mound
jetties
were
built
to
stabilize
this
entrance
channel
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
most
particularly
concerned
is
the
north
jetty,
which
according
to
an
undisputed
government
report,
formed
a
barrier
to
the
down-coast
drift
of
sand
suspended
in
the
ocean.
as
a
result,
the
shoreline
along
the
coast
guard
site
moved
seaward
almost
two-thirds
of
a
mile
at
the
jetty.
comparison
of
maps
showing
the
unjettied
entrance
with
maps
after
the
jetties
were
built
shows
the
progressive,
dramatic
boundary
changes.
california
has
lodged
with
the
court
a
blown-up
exhibit
of
a
series
of
such
maps.
that
this
shoreline
change
would
not
have
occurred
as
a
result
of
natural
wave
and
tidal
action
unaided
by
the
jetty
barrier
may
best
be
shown
by
an
examination
of
a
1915
map
showing
the
north
jetty
destroyed.
during
that
time,
the
jetty
ceased
to
function
as
a
barrier
to
the
down-coast
drift
of
sand
and
the
shoreline
reverted
to
its
natural
configuration.
once
the
jetty
was
rebuilt,
the
artificial
deposition
process
continued,
covering
up
and
filling
in
the
land,
resulting
in
the
current
coastline
configuration.
never
considered
part
of
the
coast
guard
site,
the
land
remains
barren
and
unused.
the
coast
guard
even
applied
to
california
for
use
of
the
land,
which
the
coast
guard
characterized
as
"artificially
accredited
land
belonging
to
california.
"
only
belatedly
did
the
united
states
assert
that
it
owned
this
artificially
accredited
land
according
to
federal
law
applied
by
virtue
of
the
rule
of
hughes
versus
washington.
after
some
peregrinations,
this
is
now
the
essential
position
of
the
united
states
before
this
court.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
we
believe
our
position
has
been
consistent.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
white.
our
position
is
quite
simple.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
we
are
not.
the
united
states
versus
california,
332
u.s.,
we
believe,
bars
us
from
doing
so.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
i
think
it
still
would
be.
we
believe
that
what
the
admiral
did
is
to
show
that
the
manager
of
the
land
believed
that
the
land...
the
manager
of
the
lands
adjacent
to
the
subject
lands
did
not
believe
that
the
subject
lands
were
part
of
the
coast
guard
site.
we
believe
that
that
is
an
interpretation
by
a
person
of
some
administrative
authority
which
is
entitled
to
some
weight
by
this
court
in
considering
the
questions
before
it,
but
it
does
not
constitute
an
estoppel.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
the
watchtower
was
built.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
they
are
used
by
members
of
the
public
to
traverse
that
portion
of
the
shoreline.
they
are
not
used
by
the
united
states
in
any
other
fashion.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
i
do
not
believe
so.
the
entrance
to
the
pacific
ocean
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
spit.
the
coast
guard
site
is
on
a
very
open
and
rough
shoreline.
it
would
be
impossible,
at
least,
i
believe
it
to
be
impossible
for
boats
to
enter
the
pacific
ocean
from
the
shoreward
side
of
the
coast
guard
site.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
i...
my
belief
is
that
the
entire
coast
guard
base
has
been
declared
surplus,
and
will
be
transferred
to
either
a
state
or
public
agency
or
to
private
parties.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
justice
o'connor,
the
land
that
comprises
the
coast
guard
site
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
in
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo,
and
is
part
of
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states.
at
the
time
that
california
became
a
state
in
1850,
all
of
the
tide
and
submerged
lands
that
were
in
california...
excuse
me,
all
of
the
tidelands
in
california
and
the
submerged
lands
by
virtue
of
the
submerged
lands
act
came
to
california
as
the
result
of
its
sovereignty
and
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
uplands
remained
in
the
united
states
for
whatever
disposition
the
united
states
desired
to
take.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
the
reservation
orders
are
contained
in
the
exhibits,
and
they
refer
to
lots
and
sections
of
particular
townships.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
those
lots
and
sections
are
described
also
in
one
of
the
exhibits
which
is
the
township
plat
that
was
prepared
by
the
united
states.
the
shoreward
boundary
of
those...
or
the
seaward
boundary
of
those
lots
is
the
boundary
of
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states.
that
is
all
the
united
states
could
reserve.
california
owned
the
lands
that
were
below
the
ordinary
high
water
mark.
that
is
what
the
term
of
the
reservation
is.
the
united
states
reserved
the
lands
above
the
ordinary
high
water
mark;
california
owned
the
lands
below
the
ordinary
high
water
mark.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
until
united
states
versus
california,
united
states
versus
california
381
u.s.,
said
that--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--i
am
suggesting
that--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--that
381
u.s.,
united
states
versus
california,
determined
the
ownership
of
lands,
the
decree
as
a
result
of
that
case
determined
the
ownership
of
lands
below
the
low
water
mark
in
california.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
it
determined
what
the
submerged
lands
act
conveyed
to
california.
our
contention
is
that
that
ownership
as
a
matter
of
equity
and
justice
related
back
to
the
time
that
california
became
a
state.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
the
act
was
designed
according
to
our
contention
to
restore
these
states--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--to
its
pre
19--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--it
used
a
variety
of
language.
it
used--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--it
used
language
such
as
follows.
"recognized,
confirmed,
established,
and
vested
in
and
assigned
to
the
respective
states.
"
this
is
the
granting
clause,
section
3
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
so
it
either
recognized,
it
confirmed,
it
established,
or
it
vested.
now,
to
recognize,
there
had
to
have
been
some
title
there
for
it
to
do
so.
this
is
the
basis
in
statutory
language.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
the
first
california
case
held
that
the
national
sovereign
as
a
result
of
its
paramount
authority
and
for
external
sovereignty
reasons
has...
excuse
me,
paramount
authority
over
the
submerged
lands
that
lie
seaward
of
the
ordinary
low
water
mark.
ownership
of
those
lands,
we
contend,
was
not
decided
in
those
cases.
alabama
versus
texas,
which
is
the
case
which
upheld
the
submerged
lands
act,
says
that--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--it
is
not.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
it
is
not.
as
admitted
by
the
united
states
in
its
answer,
the
depositions
that
were
caused
by
the
jetty
were
deposited
below
the
ordinary
high
water
mark
on
california's
sovereign
tidelands.
this
conclusion
is
found
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
although
in
united
states
versus
california,
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
state's
title
to
tidelands,
lands
that
lie
landward
of
the
low
water
mark
but
seaward
of
the
high
water
mark,
was
not
questioned.
the
court
explicitly
recognized
california's
title
to
tidelands.
this
title
was
also
confirmed
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
united
states
versus
california,
381
u.s.,
this
court
set
the
seaward
boundary
of
the
state's
open
coast
tidelands
at
the
low
water
mark
as
that
mark
actually
exists.
thus,
the
low
water
mark
boundary
of
tidelands
follows
physical
reality,
no
matter
the
cause
of
the
change
in
its
physical
location,
whether
natural
or
gradual,
sudden...
whether
natural
or
artificial,
sudden
or
gradual.
in
this
case,
as
the
jetty-caused
depositions
occurred
along
the
coast
guard
site,
the
low
water
mark
was
pushed
further
and
further
seaward.
on
the
other
hand,
under
california
law,
the
high
water
boundary
of
tidelands
does
not
remain
ambulatory
in
these
conditions.
under
undisputed
california
law,
when
the
depositions
are
caused
by
the
works
of
man,
as
here,
they
are
treated
as
artificial
accretions
owned
by
the
state.
the
effect
of
this
rule
is
to
fix
the
high
water
mark
boundary
in
its
location
immediately
prior
to
the
effect
of
the
artificial
works.
this
is
similar
to
the
rule
concerning
an
evulsion,
which
also
results
in
the
fixing
of
a
boundary
at
a
former
location.
thus,
as
all
depositions
occurred
seaward
of
the
high
water
mark
fixed
in
location
immediately
prior
to
the
jetty
construction,
but
landward
of
the
low
water
mark,
such
depositions
occurred
on
california's
tidelands
in
which
california,
as
admitted
by
the
united
states,
has
absolute
title.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
that
is
a
decision
which
california
submits
each
state
makes
for
itself.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
california
law
would
be
that
those
accretions
go
to
the
upland
owner.
the
upland
owner's
boundary
would
move
out
as
the
accretions
occurred.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
yes,
justice
white.
under--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--the
critical
fact
in
this...
as
to
this
part
of
the
case
is
that
these
were
artificially
caused--
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
--and
under
california
law
there
is
no
question
but
that
they
were
artificially
caused.
california's
conclusion,
i
will
frankly
admit,
depends
on
the
application
of
state
law
to
decide
the
boundary
contest
between
the
upland
owner,
the
united
states,
and
california,
the
owner
of
the
tidelands,
over
the
effect
of
the
movement
of
their
mutual
boundary,
the
high
water
mark.
california
submits
that
the
rule
of
american
jurisprudence
since
california...
since
pollard's
lessee
versus
hagan
was
decided
in
1845,
has
been
that
the
effect
on
land
title
of
after
statehood
changes
in
the
high
water
boundary
of
sovereign
lands
such
as
tidelands
is
decided
under
state
law.
long
established
precedents
of
this
court
have
held
that
state
law
applies
to
determine
the
right
of
littoral
owners
in
sovereign
lands.
thus,
the
united
states
had
no
expectation
to
the
land
formed
by
jetty
construction
based
on
application
of
federal
law.
this
rule
is
founded
in
the
constitutional
doctrines
which
preserve
the
basic
powers
and
sovereign
attributes,
sovereign
inherent
attributes
of
the
states.
the
rule
has
been
recognized
by
this
court,
which
holds
that
state
sovereign
title
is
absolute
so
far
as
any
federal
principle
of
land
titles
was
concerned,
and
cannot
be
defeased
by
application
of
federal
common
law.
in
fact,
the
united
states
admits
in
paragraph
5
of
its
answer
that
the
state's
title
to
tidelands
lying
landward
of
the
coastline
as
these
lands
do
is
absolute.
although
the
united
states
recognizes
this
rule,
it
seeks
to
restrict
its
application
solely
to
sovereign
lands
underlying
inland
waters,
but
other
than
an
offhand
reference
to
hughes,
there
is
no
reason
given
that
would
distinguish
tidelands
along
inland
waters
from
tidelands
along
the
open
coast.
presumably,
the
united
states
argues,
based
on
hughes,
that
there
are
international
relations
implications
in
the
determination
of
the
high
water
boundary
along
the
open
coast
that
require
creation
of
federal
common
law.
our
opening
brief,
at
pages
13
to
18,
disposes
of
this
contention,
and
none
of
the
three
briefs
filed
by
the
united
states
elaborates
on
this
point
or
responds
to
those
arguments.
hughes,
if
it
has
any
remaining
viability,
should
be
overruled.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
hughes
would
be
controlling
in
this
case.
this
case
is
an
analogue
to
hughes.
it
involves
open
coast
lands.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
we
think
hughes
is
wrongly
decided,
however,
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
stated
in
our
briefs.
the
concessions
by
the
united
states
that
state
law
governs
sovereign
land
boundary
conflicts
and
inland
waters
at
page
15
of
its
opening
brief
and
in
its
answer
at
paragraph
5,
where
it
admits
that
california
has
absolute
title
to
lands
that
are
landward
of
the
coastline,
are
dispositive
of
this
question.
the
rule
cannot
be
otherwise,
as
the
state's
title
to
such
tidelands,
whether
along
the
open
coast
or
along
inland
waters
is
constitutionally
founded.
thus,
the
application
of
state
law
to
decided
contests
over
such
lands
cannot
be
limited
solely
to
lands
under
inland
water.
such
state
laws
apportion
changes
between
competing
landowners
in
accordance
with
the
customs
and
usages
that
have
grown
up
in
the
state
after
long
experience.
this
is
a
workable
regime,
consisting
of
a
defined
body
of
rules
relied
on
by
all
property-owners
in
the
state
in
the
management
of
their
holdings,
and
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
united
states
is
the
upland
owner.
wilson
versus
omaha
indian
tribe
recognizes
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
united
states
as
the
littoral
owner
does
not
provide
an
independent
basis
for
application
of
federal
law.
further,
federal
interests
are
not
implicated
as
long
as
the
state
rules
of
property
are
not
applied
discriminatorily.
surely,
the
united
states
cannot
complain
that
california's
rule,
which
fixes
the
upland
boundary
at
a
former
location,
affects
the
sovereign
interest
of
the
united
states,
any
more
than
the
rule
of
supposed
federal
law
where
an
elusive
change
would
also
fix
that
upland
boundary
without
affecting
federal
interests.
other
than
an
oblique
reference
to
hughes,
the
united
states
supplies
no
reason
to
create
a
federal
rule.
as
this
is
an
area
that
is
integrally
related
to
the
constitutional
sovereignty
of
the
states,
and
as
in
wilson,
it
requires
the
adoption
of
state
law
as
the
rule
of
decision.
independently
of
the
last
argument,
california
submits
that
the
submerged
lands
act
confirms
california's
title
to
the
subject
lands
as
"made"
lands
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
these
lands
are
in
fact
"made"
lands.
the
jetty
was
the
sole
and
direct
cause
of
two-thirds
of
a
mile
of
deposition.
this
court
has
long
referred
to
such
lands
formed
by
such
artificial
depositions
as
"made"
lands.
for
example,
in
jones
versus
johnstone,
59
u.s.
at
157,
and
in
county
of
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
at
90
u.s.
at
page
50,
in
the
senate
hearings
on
the
act,
land
formed
along
jetties
by
tidal
action,
such
as
the
lands
here,
was
termed
by
senator
price
daniel
"made"
lands.
what
makes
this
statement
of
great
significance,
more
than
the
offhand
remark,
as
claimed
by
the
united
states,
is
the
fact
that
it
was
made
by
senator
daniel.
senator
daniel
argued
both
united
states
versus
california
and
united
states
versus
texas
before
this
court.
senator
daniel
was
also
one
of
the
senate's,
if
not
the
senate's
leading
expert
on
the
need
for
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
further,
the
remarks
of
senator
cordon
quoted
in
california's
reply
brief
at
page
9
show
that
congress
contemplated
the
exact
situation
here.
lands
that
were
once
water-covered
but
through
artificial
activity
no
longer
are
are
confirmed
to
the
state.
indeed,
it
is
a
settled
rule
of
property
that
the
owner
of
once
water-covered
land
made
upland
by
the
littoral
owner
retains
title
to
those
lands.
here,
congress
recognized
this
rule
of
property
and
confirmed
california's
title
to
the
submerged
lands
which
were
made
upland
by
the
act
of
the
littoral
owner.
if
there
was
any
doubt
that
congress
intended
to
confirm
california's
title
to
the
lands
formed
by
artificial
deposition,
it
is
dispelled
by
a
consideration
of
the
purpose
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
great
purpose
was
to
restore
the
states
to
their
pre-1947
position.
under
settled
california
law,
california
was
the
owner
of
those
lands
prior
to
1947.
as
a
matter
of
equity
and
justice,
congress
confirmed
to
the
states
the
title
that
the
states
thought
they
had
prior
to
1947.
now
that
the
united
states
has
retreated
from
its
submerged
lands
argument,
it
is
clear
that
this
boundary
dispute
between
the
owner
of
tidelands
and
the
adjoining
upland
owner,
as
california
has
repeatedly
argued,
is
wholly
extraneous
to
matters
concerned
in
the
determination
of
the
coastline
and
the
offshore
boundary
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
united
states
urges
upon
this
court
the
astounding
proposition
that
there
is
a
constitutional
rule
of
ambulatory
navigable
water
boundaries
which
all
states
accepted
as
part
of
their
equal
footing
grant,
and
which
has
been
confirmed
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
particularly
in
section
5
thereof.
based
on
this
assertions,
the
united
states
claims
that
section
5
creates
in
the
united
states
the
right
to
retain
accretions
to
reserved
uplands,
state
law
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
such
a
contention
directly
conflicts
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
indeed,
it
places
california
in
a
worse
position
than
if
the
submerged
lands
act
had
never
been
enacted.
even
under
the
1947
california
decision,
california's
title
to
lands
lying
landward
of
the
low
water
mark
was
unquestioned.
as
the
submerged
lands
act
was
meant
to
restore
the
states
to
their
pre-1947
position,
it
should
not
be
interpreted
to
deprive
california
of
land
lying
landward
of
the
low
water
mark
that
even
under
the
1947
california
decision
california
owned.
aside
from
the
argument
that
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
do
not
except
from
the
confirmation
accretions
to
retained
federal
uplands,
certainly
this
case
does
not
fall
within
the
class
of
federal
interests
that
were
designed
to
be
protected
by
section
5.
section
5
was
designed
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
any
property
which
it
actually
occupied
or
is
using.
especially
in
this
case,
where
the
united
states
had
no
expectation
at
the
time
the
jetty
was
rebuilt
that
it
would
own
the
land
created,
where
the
united
states
has
neither
occupied
nor
used
the
land,
and
where
the
manager
of
the
coast
guard
site
considered
this
land
not
part
of
this
installation
but
as
belonging
to
california,
section
5
does
not
except
the
subject
land
from
operation
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
finally,
so
far
as
the
lands
here,
the
lands
along
the
open
coast
that
lie
landward
of
the
low
water
mark,
as
well
as
lands
underlying
inland
waters,
it
is
california's
position
that
section
5
of
the
act
and
those
exceptions
cannot
give
the
united
states
any
more
title
to
such
lands
than
the
united
states
can
establish
under
state
law.
such
lands
were
already
in
state
ownership
by
virtue
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
the
submerged
lands
act
cannot
restrict
or
defease
california
of
its
absolute
title
to
such
lands.
the
section
5
exceptions
could
only
condition
those
lands
that
were
seaward
of
the
low
water
mark
along
the
open
coast
which
the
states
lost
in
the
tidelands
cases
but
later
received
by
virtue
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
using
state
law
to
determine
the
rights
of
the
united
states
as
an
upland
owner
would
place
no
more
additional
burden
on
the
united
states
than
on
any
corporation
that
does
business
in
more
than
one
state.
the
united
states
would
be
required
to
research
each
state's
property
laws,
hardly
a
burdensome
or
an
impossible
task.
in
fact,
the
court
recently
held
that
such
a
requirement
does
not
interfere
with
the
program
of
the
small
business
administration.
indeed,
the
court
has
also
held
that
federal
water
rights
are
subject
to
the
various
water
laws
of
the
states.
nor
would
the
united
states
be
deprived
of
access
to
the
sea
if
it
really
needed
such
access.
the
united
states
would
merely
need
to
condemn
whatever
access
it
needs,
although,
as
in
most
such
cases,
agreement
is
the
more
likely
avenue
of
resolution.
what
the
united
states
seeks
to
do
here
is
to
unilaterally
deprive
the
state
of
land
which
the
state
owns
under
settled
state
law
by
applying,
indeed,
creating
a
federal
common
law.
this
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
mandate
not
only
of
corvallis
but
of
erie
versus
tompkins.
under
the
federal
system,
the
states
have
certain
fundamental
and
immutable
sovereign
attributes,
long
recognized
by
this
court,
and
concerned
directly
in
this
case,
the
sovereign
land
title
and
the
right
to
apply
state
law
to
decide
disputes
over
such
lands.
acceptance
of
the
united
states'
assertion
would
alter
the
balance
between
the
states
and
the
nation
envisioned
in
the
constitution
by
its
framers
and
set
out
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
talismanic
incantation
of
national
sovereignty
cannot
cause
the
state
to
forfeit
their
retained
sovereign
rights.
california's
motion
for
summary
judgment
should
be
granted.
thank
you.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
one
question
from
the
court,
i
would
like
to
advise
the
court
as
to
what
the
state
of
california
law
is
concerning
artificial
accretions.
it
has
been
the
rule
in
the
state
since
1866.
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
carpenter
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
in
the
people
versus
hecker
case,
also
cited
in
our
brief,
go
back
to
1866
and
form
a
continuum
of
cases
that
stem
from
that
date.
so,
the
carpenter
case
and
the
hecker
case
after
the
submerged
lands
act
worked
no
change
in
the
law
that
was
adverted
to
by
justice
stewart
in
the
carpenter
case.
there
was
no
defeasance
of
the
right
of
a
littoral
owner
to
accretions.
with
respect
to
accretions
to
upland,
this
court
held
in
1876
that
each
state
decides
for
itself
who
gets
title
to
those
accretions.
this
was
in
barney
versus
keokuk,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
two
years
later,
the
court
decided
county
of
st.
clair
versus
lovingston,
which
is
the
main
case
concerning
accretions
on
which
the
united
states
relies.
that
case
was
a
state
law
case.
the
authority
that
is
relied
on
in
county
of
st.
clair
is
a
new
york
case,
and
it
was
done,
as
is
pointed
out,
during
the
rule
of
swift
versus
tyson,
when
local
real
property
laws
were
used
to
determine
the
rights
to
property.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
yes,
it
was.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
it
was
a
common
law
case,
the
common
law
of
illinois,
which
looked
to
new
york.
the
reference
that
california
courts
might
not
apply
the
carpenter
rule
to
federally
owned
upland
is
based
on
a
statement
in
carpenter
where
an
exception
appears
to
have
been
made
for
federally
owned
upland.
that
court
was
relying
on
the
borax
decision,
which
had
been
decided
some
eight
years
earlier,
and
was
using
the
same
expansive
reading
of
borax
that
this
court
has
said
in
corvallis
was
erroneous.
with
respect
to
hughes
versus
washington,
if
it
has
not
been
overruled
by
corvallis,
which
we
contend
it
is,
my
concession
is
limited
to
that
submission.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
it
does
not.
mr.
bruce
s.
flushman
the
exception
under
the
submerged
lands
act
in
section
5
is
termed
in
clauses.
there
are
four
or
five
different
clauses.
the
first
clause,
which
pertains
to
all
accretions
to
uplands
that
are
acquired
by
the
united
states.
the
second
clause
pertains
to
lands
that
were
either
ceded
to
or
reserved
by
the
united
states.
there
is
no
accretions
clause
attaching
to
that.
now,
the
united
states
makes
a
jump
of
logic
to...
or
a
jump
of
statutory
interpretation
to
also
attach
the
accretions
clause
in
the
first
clause
of
section
5
to
the
second
clause
of
section
5,
but
that
is
not
our
main
argument.
our
main
argument
is
that
with
respect
to
tidelands,
lands
that
lay
above
the
low
water
mark,
the
court
in
united
states
versus
california
in
1947
did
not
dispute
the
state's
title.
these
lands
lie
above
the
low
water
mark.
the
congress
in
1953
could
not
defease
the
state
of
its
title
to
those
lands.
so,
we
contend
that
the
term
5,
is
given
content
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
we
rely
on
that
submission
as
part...
because
as
part
of
the
first
clause
of
section
5
state
law
is
referred
to.
in
section
3
of
the
submerged
lands
act
as
well
the
lands
that
are
granted
or
are
restored
or
confirmed
under
the
act
are
to
be
administered
under
state
law,
and
also
under
section
3,
section
3
looks
to
those
persons
who
were
entitled
to
those
lands
in
june,
1950,
under
state
law,
so
state
law
is...
references
to
state
law
are
replete
throughout
the
act.
we
contend
that
this
is
an
express
intent
of
congress,
that
federal
common
law,
a
new
common
law
rule
under
federal
law
should
not
be
created,
but
that
the
rules
of
state
law
should
be
looked
to
to
interpret
the
submerged
lands
act.
under
that
contention,
california's
rule
would
apply.
the
united
states
would
not
receive
artificially
accredited
lands
that
attached
to
its
upland
holdings.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing.
