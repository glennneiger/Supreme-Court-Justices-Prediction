mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
argument
is
presented
on
behalf
of
the
constitutional
board
of
trustees
which
administers
and
sets
policy
for
all
higher
learning
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
case
reviews
a
holding
that
any
single-sex
campus
for
females
is
unconstitutional,
absent
the
maintenance
of
a
single-sex
campus
for
males.
it
is
not
limited
to
any
narrow
holding
with
respect
to
nursing
programs,
but
it
applies
campus-wide.
the
defendant
board
of
trustees
operates
eight
university
campuses
in
mississippi
in
different
locations.
seven
of
them
are
co-educational,
and
one
is
female.
the
board
of
trustees
sets
the
policies
and
decides
which
universities
may
award
which
degrees.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
we
are
not
here
to
perpetuate
a
nineteenth
century
finishing
school
to
teach
young
women
needlecraft
and
kindergarten
keeping.
mississippi
university
for
women
is
a
contemporary
university
which
tries
to
prepare
women
to
meet
the
challenges
of
today.
our
opponents
have
said
that
muw
offers
such
programs
as
fashion
modeling
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
also
offers,
in
accordance
with
the
bulletin
which
has
been
introduced,
air
force
rotc,
computer
sciences,
accounting,
pre-dentistry,
pre-medical
education,
pre-law,
and
other
such
courses.
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
look
for
a
moment
at
the
history
of
this
institution.
it
was
the
first
state-supported
institution
for
the
higher
education
of
women
in
the
country.
it
was
founded
in
1884
after
the
university
of
mississippi
had
become
co-educational,
so
it
cannot
be
said
that
it
was
founded
for
the
purpose
of
relegating
women
to
some
inferior
school.
on
the
contrary,
as
the
bulletin
indicates,
it
was
the
result
of
the
efforts
of
a
woman
named
salley
renault
and
a
number
of
other
very
progressive
women
of
that
era
seeking
higher
education
for
women.
the
holding
of
the--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
reason
was
that
women
perceived
a
special
need
for
some
of
them
for
education
especially
tailored
to
the
needs
of
women,
and
i
would
certainly
say
that
not
all
women
perceived
this
need.
neither
did
they
then,
nor
do
they
today,
but
our
argument
is
that
under
the
theory
of
federalism,
if
it
is
not
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
mississippi
should
be
permitted
to
allow
women
who
want
single-sex
education
to
get
it.
now,
mississippi
used
to
have
a
single-sex
higher
educational
institution
for
men,
but
that
no
longer
exists,
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
it
no
longer
exists
because
the
demand
no
longer
exists,
but
the
demand
continues
for
single-sex
education
for
women,
and
we
believe
that
this
option
is
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
to
the
extent
that
federal
funds
are
granted
under
title
ix
to
all
single-sex
institutions
who
fit
within
the
exception
of
title
ix,
there
are
approximately
180
such
institutions
in
the
country,
and
one
of
our
concerns
in
this
case
is,
what
will
the
fallout
be
should
this
court
adjudicate
that
no
single-sex
institution
that
receives
state
or
federal
funds
passes
constitutional
muster.
where
will
the
department
of
education
be
left
in
the
administration
of
funds
under
title
ix
as
to
which
congress
has
made
a
specific
single-sex
undergraduate
exception?
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
mr.
justice
marshal--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--not
considerably,
your
honor.
it
is
done--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--because,
your
honor--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--no,
sir.
the
testimony
which
was
presented
by
president
strobel
and
by
vice
president
kraft
clearly
indicates
that
auditing
courses
takes
place
largely,
almost
exclusively,
at
night,
and
that
they
relate
to
items
of
community
service
rather
than
the
true
academic
field.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
well,
the--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--i
understand,
sir.
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
but
they
are
not
there--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--they
are
not
there
during
the
regular
day.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
they
are
there
for
special
courses
such
as
real
estate,
salesmanship,
and
other
things
that
the
university
perceives
to
be
of
community
interest,
and
the
very
fact
that
they
don't
receive
credit,
according
to
dr.
kraft,
is
self-limiting,
and
there
will
be
very
few
of
them,
but
when
you
give
credit
to
men,
then
that
makes
it
in
all
respects
a
co-educational
institution.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
think,
your
honor,
that
craig
versus
boren
certainly
sets
out
that
there
must
be
a
necessary
state
purpose,
and
this
must
serve
as
an
essential
element
of
fulfilling
that
purpose.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
rostka
versus
goldberg
indicates
that
the
majority
of
the
court
certainly
stopped
short
of
saying
that
all
gender
classifications
are
suspect
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word,
and
i
would
submit--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--at
hattiesburg
or
jackson
or
now
at
tupelo.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
because
it
was
convenient
in
the
same
way
that
it
would
have
been
convenient
for
the
plaintiffs
in
williams
versus
mcnair
to
have
gone
to
winthrop
college.
his
complaint
is
not
that
mississippi
and
the
defendant
board
of
trustees
will
not
give
him
a
nursing
education,
and
it
is
not
that
he
can't
get
the
best
nursing
education
that
is
offered
by
the
state.
as
your
honor
points
out,
his
complaint
is
that
it
is
not
as
convenient
for
him
as
he
would
like
it
to
be
to
receive
such
an
education.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
it
has
not,
and
did
not
apply
for
such
funds.
that
is
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
strobel,
your
honor.
we
would
certainly
submit
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof,
which
is
an
issue
which
has
been
brought
up
in
the
briefs,
that
mr.
hogan
filed
his
suit
and
he
proved
that
he
was
denied
admission
because
he
didn't
meet
the
qualification
of
being
a
woman,
but
he
did
no
more
than
that.
he
took
discovery,
his
counsel
did,
and
in
this
discovery,
both
the
depositions
of
dr.
strobel,
the
president,
dr.
harvey
kraft,
the
vice
president
for
academic
affairs,
and
other
representatives
of
the
university
were
taken,
and
live
testimony
was
taken
at
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing.
the
district
judge
decided
in
his
discretion
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
then
he
specifically...
the
district
judge
specifically
invited
the
plaintiff
to
offer
any
evidence
of
any
disputed
fact,
saying
that
absent
any
evidence
of
a
disputed
fact,
that
summary
judgment
would
be
entered.
mr.
hogan
did
not
see
fit
to
put
on
any
testimony
to
contradict
the
educational
theories
that
were
advanced
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
strobel
and
dr.
kraft.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
adopt
those
educational
theories
or
to
decide
that
the
mississippi
legislature
is
correct
in
affording
credence
to
the
theories
that
women
in
the
1980's
can
benefit
from
single-sex
education.
i
think
that
under
parrum
versus
hughes,
it
is
only
necessary
that
this
court
find
that
such
theories
are
not
totally
without
reason,
and
therefore
the
legislature
is
within
its
reasonable
prerogative
in
accepting
those
theories
of
education
along
with
the
co-educational
theories
which,
of
course,
are
afforded
full
play.
i
think
that
it
is
very
interesting
in
these
depositions
to
see
some
of
the
things
that
dr.
kraft
and
dr.
strobel
said
about
the
role
and
the
mission
of
muw.
dr.
kraft
said,
"in
the
absence
of
males,
women
are
assured
leadership
roles
in
all
regards.
"
"the
entire
society
is
led
by
women
officers.
"
"the
faculty
is
predominantly
female,
showing
women
leadership
roles.
"
he
said,
"we
know
that
in
our
society
at
this
time
there
are
several
groups
that
are
not
readily
admitted
to
the
mainstream
of
life
in
business
and
the
professions
and
government,
and
that
certain
measures
have
to
be
taken
to
assure
these
people
proper
access
to
roles
in
government,
business,
and
the
professions.
"
"at
this
time,
we
still
need
some
stepping
stones
for
women
into
the
larger
world,
and
i
think
this
institution
can
provide
that
stepping
stone.
"
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
our
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
bulletin
shows
that
of
the
four
vice
presidents,
two
are
female
and
two
are
male.
a
majority
of
the
deans
are
female.
and
according
to
dr.
kraft's
unrebutted
testimony,
a
majority
of
the
faculty
is
female.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
the
nursing
school,
your
honor,
which
did
not--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--yes,
sir.
the
nursing
school
was
not
founded
until
1971.
the
nursing
school,
to
my
knowledge,
is
entirely
female.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
well,
the
testimony
of
the
director
or
dean
of
the
nursing
school
is
in
the
record,
as
well
as
her
deposition.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no,
i
don't
think
we
are,
your
honor.
i
think
we
are
talking
about
the
entire
university,
because
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
strikes
down
the
right
of
mississippi
to
operate
muw
per
se,
and
not
the
nursing
school.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
inaccuracies
of
some
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed.
i
would
like
also
to
allude
to
dr.
strobel's
testimony,
when
he
said
that
in
his
experience,
both
as
an
administrator
and
a
faculty
member,
he
had
never
encountered
a
positive
reinforcement
system
which
seems
as
prevalent
as
that
on
the
campus
of
muw,
that
he
firmly
believes
that
the
special
needs
of
women
are
uniquely
served
by
this
institution.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
your
honor,
the
dean
of
the--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--yes.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
the
dean
of
the
nursing
school
testified
that
she
felt
that
the
maintenance
of
the
all-female
atmosphere
was
important
to
fulfill
the
mission
of
muw.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that's
the
only
woman
who
testified.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
well,
there
were
only
two
men,
your
honor.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
one
was
the
top--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--your
honor,
the
president
and
two
of
the
four
vice
presidents
are
men.
two
of
the
four
vice
presidents
are
women.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
may
i
respond
to
that
by
saying
that
dr.
strobel
testified
that
the
results
were
extremely
good
with
respect
to
the
admission
of
muw
graduates
to
law
schools,
medical
schools,
and
dental
schools,
as
compared
to
women
applicants
from
co-educational
institutions
in
the
area.
he
also
cited
the
work
of
dr.
tidbull
and
alexander
astin,
which
we
have
mentioned
in
our
brief,
and
those
educators
have
advanced
those
theories,
that
women
graduates
of
women's
colleges
have
unusual
records
of
achievement.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
sir.
it
certainly
is.
there
was
no
evidence
put
on
at
all
to
contradict
the
educational
theories
that
the
muw
people
advanced.
i
think
that
the
title
ix
argument
that
this
court
need
consider
is
an
interesting
one,
and
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
i
clearly
am
not
going
to
argue
that
the
congress
can
abridge
fourteenth
amendment
rights
and
narrow
anybody's
constitutional
rights.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
believe
that
the
majority
of
this
court,
as
i
read
the
cases,
would
come
out
on
a
sort
of
mid-level--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
he
found
that
the
state
had
proved
that
it
was
a
rational
way
to
exercise
an
important
state
function,
and
i
don't
read
his--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--well--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--i
think
he
clearly
finds
that
it
bears
a
rational
relationship.
i
think
if
you
will
read
into
it--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--that
it
doesn't
bear
any
more,
an
iota
more
than
a
rational
relationship,
it
is
certainly
dicta
at
the
very
best,
because
he
did
find
it
rational.
i
think
at
that
time
he
was
dealing
and
the
arguments
were
dealing
with
standards
of
review,
and
he
certainly
came
out
on
the
side
that
rational
is
enough,
but
my
argument
today
is
that
we
have
met
craig
versus
boren
every
way
i
believe
you
can
look
at
it
with
the
testimony
that
has
been
presented
and
that
is
uncontradicted.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
don't
think
that's
before
the
court.
i
think
the
reason
that
mississippi
doesn't
have
a
male-only
school
is
that
the
legislature
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
longer
a
demand
for
it.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
and
our
argument
with
respect
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
mississippi
affords
both
sexes
access
to
all
educational
programs,
and--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--well,
the
reason
we
think
that
there
are
not
enough
males
who
believe
that
they
need
single-sex
education
to
justify
it
within
the
prerogative
of
the
legislature.
one
might,
of
course,
analogize
to
mr.
justice
marshal's
opinion
in
fullilove,
in
which,
if
you
change
the
words
muw,
because
the
disadvantaged
male
here
is
a
member
of
a
class
which
this
court
has
never
traditionally
found
to
be
in
need
of
some
special
help.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
sir,
but
i
again
think
we
can
meet
the
craig
versus
boren
test.
mr.
hogan's
disadvantage
is
the
same
as
the
disadvantage
of
a
resident,
say,
of
hattiesburg
who
wants
to
be
a
veterinarian.
mississippi
doesn't
offer
him
veterinary
schooling
in
hattiesburg,
where
they
have
a
university.
they
offer
it
only
in
starkville.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
but
i
think
the
conclusion
is
that
going
to
this
school
is
only
a
disadvantage
to
him,
i
mean,
not
being
able
to
go
this
school
is
just
a
disadvantage,
as
if
he
were
someone
seeking
a
curriculum
that
was
only
taught
at
another
institution.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no,
i
would
not,
because
that
case
has
been
clearly
decided,
that
people
who
go
to
school
with
only
members
of
their
own
race
are
denied
the
educational
opportunities,
brown
versus
board
of
education.
clearly,
that
could
not
be
done.
the
title
ix
argument
which
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
is
not
that
congress
can
change
the
constitution,
but
that
in
a
number
of
cases,
most
recently,
i
think,
rostka
versus
goldberg,
this
court
has
indicated
an
interest
in
deferring
in
certain
areas
to
the
expressed
and
rationed
conclusions
of
congress.
in
making
the
title
ix
exception,
it
is
very
clear
that
congress
intended
to
continue
to
appropriate
money
for
state
supported
and
other
single-sex
institutions
that
traditionally
were
so.
congress
certainly
couldn't
intend
to
appropriate
money
for
an
unconstitutional
purpose.
so,
the
view
of
congress
at
least
has
been
clearly
expressed
in
this
regard,
and
i
wonder
what
the
title
ix
fallout
could
be
if
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
is
permitted
to
stand.
will
we
next
be
facing
challenges
of
whether
we
have
co-educational
versus
single-sex
dormitories,
or
where
those
dormitories
may
be
located
with
respect
to
convenience
to
the
students,
whether
or
not
we
could
have
co-educational
versus
single-sex
athletic
programs,
and
if
a
student
has
a
right
to
participate
in
such
a
program
that
is
only
available
to
one
of
another
sex?
so,
i
think
that
this
case
bears
considerable
interest
and
effect
constitutionally,
not
just
for
this
single
institution
but
in
the
administration
of
the
title
ix
program
at
large,
and
if
i
may,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
colom
would
have
us
be
required
to
prove
that
women
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
united
states,
perhaps
in
the
state
of
mississippi
in
particular.
in
response
to
that,
i
would
refer
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
frontiero
versus
richardson,
beginning
with
the
statement,
"there
can
be
no
doubt
that
our
nation
has
had
a
long
and
unfortunate
history
of
sex
discrimination.
"
"it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
in
part
because
of
the
high
visibility
of
the
sexual
characteristic,
women
still
face
pervasive,
although
at
times
more
subtle,
discrimination
in
our
educational
institutions,
in
the
job
market,
and
in
the
political
arena.
"
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
his
argument,
but
i
understand
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
decide
that
question,
but
decided
that
a
single-sex
institution
for
women
across
the
board
must
be
stricken
unless
there
is
a
male
institution.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
think
the
court
would
be
bound
to
accept
the
unrefuted
testimony
of
dr.
kraft
and
dr.
strobel
that
the
auditing
that
exists
is
a
very
limited
program
which
primarily
takes
place
at
night--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
two
more
have
applied
since
mr.
hogan's
application.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
my
understanding
is
that
the
professor,
and
the
record
shows
this,
a
professor
must
give
his
or
her
permission
for
a
student
to
audit
a
class,
and
auditing,
while
there
are
no
specific
guidelines
that
say
you
cannot
audit
a
class
during
the
regular
course
of
the
day,
the
situation
that
exists
is
that
that
just
doesn't
take
place,
and
there
is
a
list
of
every
male
who
has
ever
audited
a
course
at
muw,
and
it
is
quite
short,
and
dr.
kraft
says
it
is
short
because
the
fact
that
they
don't
get
credit
is
self-limiting,
and
that
that
distinguishes
it
and
doesn't
cause
it
to
invade
the
all-female
atmosphere
of
the
student
body.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
sir.
mr.
colom
indicated
that
we
had
never
talked
in
terms
of
affirmative
action
to
help
women
by
the
operation
of
muw.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
read
dr.
strobel's
testimony
or
dr.
kraft's
testimony
and
conclude
that
they
are
describing
anything
less
than
a
program
of
very
positive
affirmative
action
to
help
women
fulfill
their
full
potential
in
today's
society.
it
is
certainly
true
that,
as
has
been
mentioned
in
the
other
argument,
that
the
plaintiff
stopped
short
when
he
filed
his
suit
and
said,
i
have
been
excluded.
he
listened
to
dr.
strobel,
he
listened
to
dr.
kraft,
he
saw
the
references
to
the
educators
who
endorsed
their
theories,
and
he
did
nothing
to
refute
that.
it
is
interesting
that
counsel
says
that
these
experts
would
be
shocked
if
they
could
see
the
w.
i
know
i
am
not
here
to
testify,
but
ms.
tidbolt
has
been
to
the
w
numbers
of
times,
and
is
coming
again
next
month,
and
i
hope
she
won't
be
any
more
shocked
than
she
has
been.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
certainly
don't,
your
honor.
that
was
an
1884
statement
of
purposes--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--it
has
not
been
changed
as
such,
but
legislative
appropriations
have
been
made
annually,
and
the
programs
and
curricula
of
the
institution
have
been
constantly
revised.
the
language
of
the
1884
enabling
act
sounds
a
good
bit
like
the
kind
of
language
this
court
might
have
used
in
muller
versus
oregon,
which
was
a
little
later,
in
1908,
and
it
spoke
of
the
need
of
women
to
achieve
a
greater
parity
with
her
brother,
who
was
the
superior
animal,
and
things
that
were
very
victorian
in
phraseology,
and
not
the
kind
of
thing
we
would
say
or
believe
today.
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
muw
has
evolved
with
the
times,
and
the
question
is,
what
are
they
doing
today
to
help
women
in
education,
and
is
dr.
strobel
right?
i
don't
think
you
have
to
believe
he
is
right.
i
think
you
just
have
to
believe
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
legislature
to
believe
that
it
is
right
that
an
institution
devoted
exclusively
to
women
can
help
them
fulfill
their
potential
in
a
unique
way.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no,
no.
no,
i
think
we
fit
craig
versus
boren,
your
honor.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
single-sex
education?
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
there
are
those
who
certainly
believe
that,
and
who
operate--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--it
can
be
argued
that,
yes,
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
