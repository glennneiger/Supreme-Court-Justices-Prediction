mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
for
resolution
to
this
court
today
is
whether
one
nurse,
joe
hogan,
will
be
barred
from
receiving
academic
credit
toward
a
bs
degree
in
nursing
simply
because
he
is
a
male.
the
question
is
not
whether
joe
hogan
may
attend
nursing
classes
at
the
university.
indeed,
he
can
attend
and
participate
fully
in
classes,
and
theoretically
he
could
audit
a
complete
course
load.
indeed,
the
president
of
the
university
said
at
page
62
of
this
transcript
that
he
could
theoretically
audit
a
complete
course
load.
joe
hogan
testified
on
page
26
of
the
transcript
that
he
was
told
that
he
could
audit
as
many
classes
as
he
wanted.
the
question
is
not
whether
single-sex
schools
are
per
se
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
such
a
holding,
and
mr.
hogan
has
never
requested
such
a
ruling
from
any
court.
the
question
that
the
defendants
have
recently
presented
is
whether
this
is
affirmative
action
for
women,
and
in
their
brief
they
use
specifically
affirmative
action
for
women,
and
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
throughout
this
litigation,
and
at
the
district
court
level,
the
defendants
invited
the
district
court
to
use
the
low
scrutiny,
the
low
scrutiny
of
williams
versus
mcnair.
they
invited
the
court
of
appeals
to
use
that
same
level
of
scrutiny.
it
is
only
when
they
get
to
the
supreme
court
that
they
now
admit
that
craig
v.
boren
gives
the
proper
standard.
we
never
heard
anything
regarding
affirmative
action
for
women
as
a
purpose
for
the
w,
as
they
call
it,
at
the
trial
level.
we
never
heard
it
at
the
fifth
circuit.
it
wasn't
even
brought
up
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
didn't
even
appear
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
submitted
to
this
court.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
mr.
justice--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--to
extent
that
waiver
means
anything
in
the
law,
i
think
they
have
waived
that,
and
what
this
is
is
an
after
the
fact
justification.
they
didn't...
that
was
not
the
purpose
for
the
w.
it
has
never
been
the
purpose.
they
stated
in
interrogatory
3...
i
go
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
this
case,
when
we
first
filed
it.
we
submitted
the
interrogatories
saying,
tell
us
all
the
reasons
you
want
the
w,
and
they
put
it...
gave
us
a
sheet
of
paper
that
said
that
we
have
always
had
the
w,
we
like
the
w,
we
want
to
keep
it
like
it
is.
never
said
anything
else
throughout
this
litigation.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
well,
it
was
never
suggested
that
affirmative
action
or
correcting
past
discrimination
against
women
was
a
purpose
for
the
university
throughout
the
litigation.
indeed,
when
we
presented
our
case
at
preliminary
hearing,
they
called
no
witnesses.
they
rested.
not
a
single
witness.
they
invited
the
district
judge
to
use
this
low
level
scrutiny,
and
now
they
complain
about
it.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
well,
your
honor--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--yes,
sir.
your
honor,
when
we
presented
our
case--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--your
honor,
we
presented
our
case.
we
felt
that
we
met
our
burden.
the
district
judge
gave
us
an
opinion
using
what
we
considered
to
be
an
improper
standard.
we
had
submitted
our
briefs
stating
what
we
felt
was
the
proper
standard.
he
apparently
accepted
the
argument
of
the
state
that
this
low
level
scrutiny
was
appropriate.
at
that
point,
we
felt
that
there
was
no
further
need
for
us
to
prove,
for
craig
v.
boren
tells
us
clearly
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
justify
the
gender
classification.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
if
the
burden
is
upon
us
to
prove
that
the
gender
classification--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--yes,
sir,
but
we
are
convinced
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
us
to
go
forward
at
that
time,
because
the
burden
was
on
them,
was
upon
the
state.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
sir,
we
argued
the
craig
v.
boren
standard
in
the
district
court,
but
the
district
court
did
not
accept
that
standard.
it
adopted
a
low
level
scrutiny,
the
rational
relation
standard.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
sir,
and
we
did
appeal
that,
based
upon...
the
record
in
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
held
that
the
district
court
applied
the
incorrect
standard,
and
then
they
proceeded
to
apply
the
correct
standard.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
sir,
and
i
believe
that
is
the
standard
applied
by
the
fifth
circuit,
which
would
require,
we
believe,
an
affirmance.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
we
did
not
file
this
as
a
class
action,
so
we
have
not
sought
relief
for
males
as
a
group,
and
that
was
an
intentional
decision
by
counsel.
we
have
not
sought...
we
have
not
sought
to
have
all
single-sex
schools
declared
unconstitutional.
we
seek
to
get
our
client
in
the
school
of
nursing.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
i
do
not
believe
it
goes
beyond
the
law,
but
i
believe
it
goes
beyond
the
specific
relief
my
client
seeks.
your
honor,
another
important--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--we
did
point
out,
mr.
justice,
that
in
vorsheimer
and
in
williams
versus
mcnair,
and
the
whole
line
of
cases
where
single-sex
schools
were
upheld,
that
they
were
considered
essentially
equal.
now,
i
read
the
oral
argument
in
vorsheimer,
and
that
was
a
major
point
of
discussion
before
this
court,
were
the
two
schools
in
philadelphia
essentially
equal.
we
did
make
that
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
the
court
used
both
standards
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
it
possibly
could,
your
honor,
because
you
would
still
have
to
have
the
craig
v.
boren
standard
applied,
because
you
would
still
have
a
gender
classification.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
i
understand
you
have
to
have
a
justification
when
you
have
a
gender
classification,
and
that
would
have
to
be
justified.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
there
are
some
suggestions
of
that
in
the
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
sir.
we
made
several
arguments
in
the
alternative.
0
[generallaughter.]
the
other
argument
that
the
defendants
now
present,
and
it
suffers
from
the
same
ailment
as
the
affirmative
action
argument,
is
that
somehow
title
ix
provides
some
exemption
for
mississippi
university
for
women.
again,
that
was
not
presented
to
the
court
until
the
petition
for
rehearing.
the
purposes
were
stated
from
the
beginning
of
this
case.
we
asked
the
president,
we
asked
the
university
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
case
in
interrogatory
number
3
that
appears
in
the
file,
give
us
all
your
reasons.
they
gave
them
to
us,
and
they
were
essentially,
we
like
it
this
way.
i
wanted
to
correct
one
thing
that
was
mentioned
by
mr.
gholson.
the
two
women
who
did
testify
with
the
nursing
school,
both
deans
of
the
school
of
nursing,
the
graduate
school
and
the
undergraduate
school,
stated
that
the
presence
of
men
would
not
affect
their
students
or
their
teaching
techniques.
we
questioned
them
at
length
about
what
they
would
change
in
their
teaching
programs.
they
could
identify
nothing.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
because
our
client
seeks
to
get
in
the
nursing
program.
he
is
a
nursing...
he
is
a
nurse
already
who
is
employed
as
a
nurse,
and
he
seeks
admission
to
a
nursing
program
which
is
predominantly
women,
exclusively
women,
a
profession
that
is
predominantly
women.
there
is
no
need
for
affirmative
action
for
women
in
the
area
of
nursing.
if
there
is
any
need,
it
is
for
affirmative
action
for
men.
another
point,
your
honor,
i
think
is
important
here
is
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
decided
to
set
aside
over
3,000
seats
in
its
school
system,
its
collegiate
school
system
just
for
women,
that
men
cannot
compete
for.
yet
these
same
women
can
compete
for
every
other
seat
in
the
system.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
there
is
no
support
for
that
in
the
record.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
still,
this
universe
would
be
subject
to
the
same
standard
of
scrutiny,
because
the
enrollment
at
the
w
has
gone
down
from
3,000
to
about
1,800
now,
and
they
are
suffering
a
dramatic
reduction
in
enrollment.
so
the
state
has
chose
to
maintain
the
single-sex
school
but
not
maintain
the
male
school
because
of
enrollment.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
regarding
the
all-male
school,
and
if
it
did
exist,
it
existed
many,
many
decades
ago,
in
an
entirely
different
context
of
education,
and
i
am
really
unable
to
answer
that.
we
have
highlighted
in
our
brief
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
support
the
w's
affirmative
action
argument,
but
i
think
we
have
clearly
shown
that
the
experts
that
they
cite
would
be
shocked
that
the
w
uses
them.
they
point
out
the
leadership
roles
as
one
of
the
most
important
characteristics
in
a
single-sex
school
for
women.
yet
of
the
ten
presidents
of
this
college,
this
university,
all
have
been
male.
the
vice
president
for
academic
affairs,
the
dean
of
many
schools,
the
director
of
admissions
personnel,
extended
services,
the
library,
the
great,
great
weight
of
leadership
has
been
by
men,
and
indeed,
how
can
they
provide
the
role
models
that
mrs.
tidbolt
points
out?
the
studies
that
they
have
referred
to
have
no
relationship
to
this
particular
school.
they
are
general
studies
about
other
schools,
primarily
schools
in
the
northeast,
who
had
entirely
different
purposes
in
their
creation.
and
i
am
very
uncomfortable,
to
be
frank
with
you,
to
have
constitutional
rights
depend
upon
what
some
sociologist
or
psychologist
says,
and
i
feel
uncomfortable
even
citing
them
in
behalf
of
my
client,
mr.
hogan,
but
it
has
become
a
central
issue
here.
mrs.
tidbolt
did
not
testify,
and
we
value
cross
examination,
because
we
would
question
her
analysis
substantially.
looking
at
the
problem
from
another
vantage
point,
the
inquiry
as
to
a
compensatory
purpose
is
not
even
appropriate
until
there
is
a
showing
of
past
discrimination
and
continuing
effects
of
that
discrimination
as
to
women.
we
have...
there
has
been
no
showing
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
the
burden
is
upon
them
to
make
the
showing,
that
their
system
has
discriminated
against
females,
and
that
they
must
take
this
extraordinary
step
in
order
to
correct
that
discrimination.
further,
they
would
have
to
show
that
in
the
area
of
nursing,
there
had
been
discrimination
against
women,
and
that
the
w
exists
to
correct
that
past
discrimination,
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
bar
men
from
that
program
to
further
that
purpose.
again,
i
must
constantly
return
to
the
record,
for
it
was
our
conclusion
from
the
beginning
of
this
litigation
that
the
burden
was
upon
the
state
to
support
their
gender
classification,
and
every
holding
by
this
court
since
1973
has
said
that,
and
clearly
the
state
has
not
met
their
burden.
if
there
are
unique
opportunities
to
be
offered
to
women
in
an
educational
atmosphere,
there
was
no
showing
by
the
state
that
it
could
not
be
done
in
a
co-educational
environment.
all
we
have
in
the
record
are
declarations
by
administrators
that
single-sex
education
has
some
important
educational
value.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
president
of
the
university,
prior
to
coming
to
the
w,
had
never
taught
females
in
a
single-sex
atmosphere
before.
and
i
would
not
consider
his
statements
to
be
authoritative
in
that
area.
he
was
not
in
administration,
but
a
scientist.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
both
my
client
testified
to
that
and
the
president
of
the
university
testified
that
theoretically
he
could
audit
the
entire
course
load.
he
said
that
is
not
practical,
that
the
university
would
limit
audits
because
they
are
paid
by
the
state,
based
upon
head
count,
and
a
student
who
is
auditing
is
not
counted
for
purposes
of
funding
from
the
state,
so
they
would
limit
them
for
that
reason.
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
another
argument
that
i
think
this
court
should
treat
as
having
little
merit
is
that
title
ix
somehow
provides
an
exception
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
the
defendant,
the
state,
has
backed
off
of
that
argument
themselves
at
this
point.
but
they
also
suggest
that
congress
somehow
intended
title
ix
to
constitute
affirmative
action
for
women,
that
the
exemption
for
women's
schools
buttresses
their
argument
that
this
is
affirmative
action
and
that
congress
approved
of
it,
but
the
problem
with
that--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--i
don't
think
any--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--you
can
draw
the
inference
that
congress
may
or
may
not
be
wrong--
mr.
wilbur
o.
colom
--in
making
that
exemption.
i
think
one
clear
inference
can
be
drawn
that
they
did
not
intend
this
to
constitute
affirmative
action
for
women's
schools,
because
they
limited
the
existence
of
it.
only
those
schools
then
existing
could
continue.
so
they
didn't
want
to
encourage
single-sex
schools.
that
was
an
action
to
stop
them,
and
to
allow
at
least
those
that
were
existing
at
that
time
to
continue
to
receive
federal
funds,
and
since
this
court
has
held
in
cannon
versus
university
of
chicago
that
title
ix
is
a
spending
powers
action
by
congress,
then
it
certainly
would
have
no
application
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
writing
for
this
court,
specifically
stated
in
the
penhurst
school
case
that
congress
has
to
specifically
invoke
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
use
its
powers
under
that
amendment.
your
honors,
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
