unknown
speaker
do
we
know
what
their
reason
was,
if
the
university
of
mississippi
was
then
co-educational?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
do
you
know
whether
there
are
many
single-sex
tax-supported
institutions
in
the
country
other
than
this
one?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
is
it
true
that
men
are
allowed
to
audit
classes?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
done,
considerably?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
done.
well,
why
can't
they
get
a
degree?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
how
can
you
have
an
all-female
school
with
male
students?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
problem
i
have.
unknown
speaker
it
must
be
horrible
to
have
men
there,
but
they
are
there.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
sort
of
second-class
citizens.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
is
a
finding
that
the
board
of
regents
had
a
belief
that
single-sex
education
benefits
women
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
for
us
to
uphold
the
provisions
for
that
institution?
and
what
level
of
scrutiny
do
we
have
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
something
more
then
than
a
mere
rational
basis
test?
unknown
speaker
some
mid-level
scrutiny
you
would
believe
is
in
place
and
in
order
for
the
review?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
am
i
correct
as
to
my
factual
assumption
that
mr.
hogan
could
have
entered
a
state-supported
school
of
nursing
at
pascagoula
or
at
jackson?
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
other
university--
unknown
speaker
--schools
of
nursing
open
to
him.
he
just
wanted
to
go
to
one
in
columbus,
in
his
back
yard.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
does
the
record
below
indicate
whether
mississippi
university
for
women
ever
obtained
funds
under
the
nurse
training
act
of
1971?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
the
respondents
claim
that
the
senior
faculty
at
the
school
is
primarily
male.
is
that
true
or
untrue?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
situation
as
to
the
nursing
school
itself?
unknown
speaker
your
other
answer
had
to
do
with
the
entire
university.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
the
nursing
school,
are
we
not?
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
any
women
that
testified
to
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
very
simple
question.
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
you
did?
and
what
did
they
testify,
that
this
was--
unknown
speaker
--and
what
other
women
said
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
woman,
but
all
the
men
said
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
were
the
top
men.
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
are
trained
in
leadership,
and
a
man
is
the
leader.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
are
there
any
findings
that
graduates
of
muw
are
better
able
to
compete
than
graduates
of
co-educational
schools?
unknown
speaker
that
is
undisputed
in
this
record,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
into
title
ix,
may
i
ask
you
another...
following
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
understand
you
agree
the
standard
of
review
must
be
higher
than
merely
rational.
that
is
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
unknown
speaker
and
as
i
read
the
district
court,
he
found
specifically
that
it
was
rational,
but
it
was
only
rational.
therefore,
under
the
district
court's
findings,
don't
you
necessarily
lose
if
your
legal
position
is
the
one
you
have
just
described?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
page
a-3
of
the
cert
petition,
"the
court
finds
that
the
maintenance
of
muw
as
an
institution
of
higher
learning
for
females
only
bears
a
rational
relationship.
"
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
goes
on
and
says
that
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
we
should--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
is
your
view,
i
take
it,
that
the
advantages
of
single-sex
education
that
justify
this...
the
refusal
to
allow
males
into
this
school
would
not
apply...
would
not
justify
a
male-only
school.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
before
the
court
in
the
sense
that
it
was
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals.
they
said
that
if
you
justify
single-sex
education,
you
must
provide
single-sex
education
to
the
members
of
both
sexes.
that
was
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
don't
afford
males
access
to
the
advantages
of
having
a
single-sex
educational
institution
they
can
attend.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
in
craig
against
boren.
they
found
the
males
needed
some
help.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
gholson,
you
keep
forgetting
your
original
point,
which
is
that
the
respondent
here
is
not
asking
for
a
separate
school
for
men.
unknown
speaker
he
is
asking
to
go
to
this
school.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
all
that
is
before
us.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
you
have
referred
to
the
demand
for
a
single-sex
institution
as
being
its
justification.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
a
demand
for
an
all-white
publicly
funded
education?
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
it
is
a
response
to
your
claim
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
not
a
new
constitutional
theory
being
injected,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
then
aren't
all
the
reasons
why
underlay
that
called
to
your
notice?
i
don't
quite
understand
your
surprise
or
waiver
suggestion.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
his
position
is
that
you
were
offered
proof
and
you
did
not
accept
it.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
that
should
be
explained?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
were
wrong,
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
all
i
am
saying
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
could
have
put
in
evidence
and
it
wouldn't
have
hurt
you.
but
if
we
find
that
you
should
have
put
it
in
and
you
didn't
put
it
in,
you
are
really
hurt.
unknown
speaker
under
your
own
theory,
though,
didn't
you
support
the
craig
against
boren
reasoning
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
conclusion
of
law,
really,
which
you
are
free
to
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
just
what
we
should
do
now?
regardless
of
what
standard
the
district
court
applied,
we
should
simply
apply
the
correct
standard.
unknown
speaker
does
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
in
your
view
go
beyond
the
relief
which
you
are
claiming?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
opinion
goes
beyond
that
which
you
are
seeking?
unknown
speaker
did
you
suggest
to
the
court
of
appeals,
or
was
it
part
of
your
theory
from
the
outset
that
the
result
might
be
different
if
mississippi
had
all-male
schools
as
well
as
all-female
schools?
or
was
that
the
product
of
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
so
the
decision
below
wouldn't
necessarily
apply
if
mississippi
did
have
schools
for
men
as
well
as
for
women.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
control
that
case,
would
it,
the
decision
below?
if
mississippi
now
started
an
all-male
school,
and
had
a
female
school
too,
the
decision
below
wouldn't
necessarily
outlaw
that
system.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
say
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
and
you
don't
have
to
have
a
justification
until
you've
got
a
discrimination,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
have
an
unequal
gender
classification.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
must
have
thought
so
or
you
wouldn't
have
made
the
argument
based
on
vorsheimer.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
a
little
puzzled
why
that
bears
on
it,
on
the
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
a
statement
of
your
opposing
counsel
is
correct
that
mississippi
at
one
time
had
an
all-male
university,
and
there
is
simply...
the
demand
for
it
so
slackened
that
it
was
no
longer
economically
feasible
to
keep
the
place
open.
now,
would
you
say
that
was
a
discrimination
if
it
happened
under
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
that
that
was
the
case.
treat
it
as
a
hypothetical
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
they
have
applied
different
criteria
to
the
women's
school
as
opposed
to
the
men's
school
in
determining
whether
to
keep
it
on
when
enrollment
is
declining?
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the...
you
mentioned,
i
think,
that
your
client
was
offered
the
opportunity
to
audit
as
many
classes
as
he
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
would
he
have
had
to
pay
tuition
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
paid
the
same
tuition
as
if
he
was
enrolled?
unknown
speaker
so
he
could
have
done
everything,
attended
the
class
and
all,
but
he
just
couldn't
have
taken
the
exams
and
gotten
a
degree.
that
is
the
only
thing
that
he
couldn't
do?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
any
inference
can
be
drawn
at
all
from
the
exclusion
from
title
ix
of
single-sex
schools?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose
if
congress
had
thought
that
they
were
unconstitutional,
would
they
have
excepted
that
from
title
ix?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but,
counsel,
your
opponent
suggests
that
that
reasoning
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
the
field
of
nursing.
unknown
speaker
would
you
comment
just
a
little
further...
i
have
tried
to
think
about
it
a
little
bit
during
the
argument...
on
when
there
are
advantages
of
single-sex
education
for
women,
how
can
those
advantages
be
preserved
by
allowing
male
students
to
audit
courses
but
simply
saying,
you
can't
take
the
exams
and
get
the
degrees?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
suppose
it
is
also
true
that
the
male
applicants
for
the
nursing
school
are
limited
in
number.
unknown
speaker
but
is
your
limitation
on
auditing
such
that
the
three
could
not
have
audited?
unknown
speaker
or
primarily
female
atmosphere
is
what
you
are
trying
to
maintain,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gholson,
does
the
state
still
rely
basically
on
the
statement
of
purposes
and
goals
contained
in
the
charter
of
muw?
unknown
speaker
and
it
has
not
been
changed,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
by
that
you
are
not
arguing
a
rational
basis
test
implied
though?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
so
great
for
women,
it
does
help
men.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
see,
that
is
where
i
have
trouble.
it
is
all
for
women,
it
is
great
for
women,
but
it
also
helps
men.
