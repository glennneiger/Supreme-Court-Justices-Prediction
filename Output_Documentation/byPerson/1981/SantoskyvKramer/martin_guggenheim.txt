mr.
martin
guggenheim
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
may
permanently
destroy
a
family
when
it
is
not
clear
that
the
evidence
justifies
doing
so.
it
is
the
petitioners'
position
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
finder
of
fact
be
reasonably
convinced
that
the
result
of
permanent
destruction
of
the
family
is
appropriate
before
the
state
may
force
such
an
irrevocable
and
fundamental
deprivation
of
liberty
on
an
individual.
new
york
and
eleven
other
states
permit
the
permanent
destruction
of
a
family
based
on
quality
of
evidence
which
is
sufficient
to
prove
liability
in
an
automobile
accident.
this
is
offensive
to
basic
notions
of
due
process.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
absolutely,
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
the
1,200
other
cases
litigated
in
new
york
each
year
on
this
subject.
it
would
of
a
measurable
and
real
value,
a
benefit
to
parents
because,
as
justice
harlan
indicated
in
winship,
what
the
standard
of
proof
does,
what
the
setting
of
a
constitutional
standard
of
proof
does
is
impress
upon
the
finder
of
fact
the
degree
of
confidence
in
the
judgment
which
is
to
be
rendered.
now,
if
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
is
whether
under
any
reading
of
this
case
a
higher
standard
would
have
been
met,
the
test
for
harmless
error
in
constitutional
adjudication
is
a
reasonable
doubt
test
set
forth
in
chapman
against
california.
the
question
would
be
whether
any
reasonable
person
could
have
found
that
this
did
not
amount
to
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
courts
have
regularly
reviewed
records
upon
a
higher
standard
of
proof,
appellate
courts
have,
and
in
this
case,
the
test
before
the
appellate
division
was
merely
whether
the
evidence
did
justify
the
result
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
there
is
both
an
impression
to
be
made
upon
the
finder
of
fact
of
the
degree
of
confidence
he
or
she
should
have
in
making
the
finding,
as
well
as
an
entire
change
of
the
direction
of
the
case,
of
the
scope
of
the
issue
before
an
appellate
court.
the
burden
is
more
squarely
placed
upon
the
state,
and
the
question
for
review
is
whether
they
have
met
that
burden
by
convincing
evidence.
i
do
think
that
this
is
a
practical
and
meaningful
right
being
sought,
both
for
the
1,200
cases
each
year
and
for
this
one.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
absolutely.
there
is
no
challenge
being
made
to
the
process
attendant
to
the
proceedings
or
to
the
judge's
own
careful
analysis
of
his
opinion
other
than
a
steadfast
refusal
to
both
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
required
a
higher
standard
of
proof
and
a
refusal
to
rule
that
by
that
higher
standard
of
proof
this
same
result
would
have
been
effected.
the
trial
court
judge
did
not
do
that.
the
appellate
court,
the
third
department,
appellate
division,
affirmed
expressly
finding
that
the
evidence
satisfied
the
preponderance
standard,
and
expressly
finding
that
a
higher
standard
was
not
constitutionally
mandated.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
think
that
the
former
alternative
would
not
necessarily
be
impermissible.
i
am
not
certain
of
the
answer.
i
think
that
at
least
remand--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--no,
no,
that
is
a
very...
a
bulky
set
of
exhibits
annexed
to
this
case,
most
of
which
we
regard,
frankly,
as
unnecessary
for
consideration.
the
record
is--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--i
do
suggest
that,
indeed.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
he
did
not.
some
of
those
are
simply
reports
issued
after
the
case
was
decided,
long
after
the
case
was
decided.
these
are
just
exhibits
submitted
to
the
court
by
the
respondent.
they
were
not...
some
of
these
are
part
of
the
record
in
earlier
litigation,
dating
back
to
the
time
the
children
first
entered
the
state's
care,
and
some
of
the
parts
of
volumes
1
and
2
do
contain...
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
anything
submitted
to
this
court
respecting
a
transcript
was
not
part
of
a
record
in
an
earlier
case.
i
don't
mean
that
at
all.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
frankly,
i
find
myself
in
a
difficult
position
answering
that
question
candidly,
because
there
have
been
facts
that
have
occurred
after
the
trial
that
are
not
in
this
record,
that
i
think
speak
favorably
to
the
parents.
i
don't
know
how
to
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention
without
answering
that
a
new
trial,
i
think,
would
be
possibly
appropriate,
but
i
do
think
frankly
that
question
should
be
considered
by
the
appellate
division
upon
remand
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
court's
opinion
were
it
to
strike
this
standard.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
or
the
trial
court.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
fine.
remand
to
the
trial
court.
at
that
point,
we
would
be
in
a
position
not
circumscribed
by
supreme
court
rules
to
advise
that
court
of
change
of
circumstances
which
we
would
regard
as
favorable
that
may
bear
upon
the
court's
decision,
and
indeed,
that
leads
to
a
point--
0....
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
am
certainly
glad
it
was
correct.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
as
i
was
saying,
among
the
points
to
be
made
here
is
that
the
decision
to
terminate
is
for
speculative
purposes.
it
is
for
purposes
of
hopefully
leading
to
an
adoption
of
a
child.
whatever
happens
after
the
record
is
fixed
is
really
for...
is
beyond
the
capacity
of
a
parent
or
the
court
to
reopen.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
absolutely,
and
i
think--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--no,
none
whatsoever
under
new
york
law.
there
is
in
most
american
jurisdictions
the
right
of
a
parent
to
reopen
an
adoption
of
a
natural
child
based
upon
fraud
or
duress
within
a
period
of
time
after
the
adoption
is
fixed,
but
of
course
those
standards
would
be
inapplicable
to
these
types
of
proceedings.
not
only
may
the
state
relitigate
when
it
loses,
it
did
so
in
this
very
case,
and
it
underscores
one
of
the
important
advantages
to
the
state
on
its
side
when
it
litigates
against
parents.
in
this
case,
it
tried
first
to
terminate
permanently
in
1976.
the
court
found
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
they
didn't
have
the
ground
sufficient
under
state
law
to
terminate.
the
state
then
appealed
to
the
appellate
division,
the
same
court
from
which
we
are
now
here
on
review,
and
that
court
affirmed,
finding
that
the
preponderance
of
the
standard...
of
the
evidence
wasn't
met,
and
found
for
the
parents
in
1978;
in
that
same
year,
they
filed
this
lawsuit
seeking
to
terminate
a
second
time.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
that
is
inappropriate.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
notions
of
res
judicata
are
applicable,
but
merely
to
indicate
one
of
the
significant
advantages
the
state
has
in
this
kind
of
proceeding.
we
are,
of
course,
here
dealing
with
rights
far
more
precious
than
property
rights,
our
most
significant
and
fundamental
rights
of
all,
the
rights
to
be
with
our
children,
the
rights
to
visit
with
our
children,
the
rights
of
our
children
to
be
with
our
parents
and
to
know
our
parents.
at
the
very
least--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--until
they
finally
lost
parental
rights,
they
never
missed
a
visit.
they
loved
their
children.
they
were
diligent
in
meeting
with
their
children
whenever
possible.
they
haven't
now
seen
their
children
since
the
court
permanently
terminated
their
rights.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
do
make
that
concession.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes,
but
lassiter
flows
from
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
and
from
an
entirely
different
analytic
framework.
lassiter
is
an
opinion
that
follows
logically
from
scott
against
illinois,
in
that
in
scott
this
court
held--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
i
respectfully
suggest
that.
i
am
not
sure
i
disagree
with
some
of
those
views,
but
the
point
is
that
scott
held
that
the
bright
line
is
not
even
threat
of
imprisonment,
as
it
might
be
in
a
jury
case.
it
is
actual
imprisonment.
so
the
presumption...
i
think
that,
justice
blackmun,
even
those
who
dissented
might
agree
with
the
phrase
that
counsel
cases
come
to
this
court
with
a
presumption
against
application
of
counsel
automatically
except
where
there
is
a
loss
of
liberty.
where
the
court
may
have
disagreed,
i
think,
was
how
to
resolve
the
particulars
in
lassiter,
the
dissent
finding
that
counsel
was
necessary
to
meet
due
process
overcoming
the
presumption,
but
at
least
for
five
members
of
this
court
the
presumption
does
follow
logically,
even
if
the
result
in
lassiter
could
be
disputed,
from
scott,
and
from
argesinger,
and
from
gideon.
in
standard
of
proof
cases,
that
bright
line
has
never
existed.
this
court
didn't
utilize
that
reasoning
in
vance
against
terrazas.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
examined
quite
carefully
the
heavy
burden
on
the
state
to
show
voluntary,
purposeful
relinquishment
of
citizenship
as
a
balancing
question
in
determining
what
standard
of
proof
was
necessary,
and
so
lassiter,
of
course,
for
those
states
in
which
counsel
is
not
required
makes
this
case
all
the
more
important,
but
ultimately--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--we
rely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
on
the--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--the
mathews
and
eldridge
analysis,
asking
what
process--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--yes,
sir.
just
the
way
this
court
found
that
to
be
the
case
in
winship.
the
court
in
lassiter
has
already
determined...
justice
stevens
in
lassiter
suggested
in
his--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
the
liberty
rights
being
violated
are--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--include...
could
be
said
to
include
the
substantive
concept
of
family
privacy,
integrity
of
family
rights,
but
one
does
not
have
to
go
off
on
substantive
due
process
in
this
kind
of
case.
justice
stevens's
dissent
in
lassiter
recognized
the
point
that
the
mathews
and
eldridge
test
belittles
constitutional
analysis,
or
is
mistaken
constitutional
analysis
when
we
are
concerned
with
fundamental,
basic
liberty
rights,
such
as
the
right
of
parents
and
children
to
be
related
to
each
other.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
absolutely,
and
this
case
is
not
at
all
to
suggest
that
permanent
destruction
of
a
family
is
inappropriate.
but
permanent
destruction
of
a
family
when
it
is
unnecessary
is
inappropriate.
permanent
destruction
of
a
family
which
shouldn't
be
done
by
the
state
is
offensive
to
the
rights
of
children,
at
least
as
much
so
to
the
rights
of
parents.
to
be
made
a
permanent
ward
of
the
state
needlessly,
to
lose
the
love
and
affection
of
a
family...
even
to
know
that
there
are
parents
out
there,
as
this
court
recognized
in
kabann,
is
a
fundamental
right,
and
this
case
doesn't
suggest
that
children
aren't
entitled
at
some
point
to
be
severed
from
their
parents.
this
case
is
merely
to
suggest
that
when
that
grave
act
is
set
out,
that
it
be
done
so
in
a
convincing
manner.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
the
question
before
the
court
that
was
litigated,
although
the
test
is
a
little
broader
than
this,
was
whether
the
parents
substantially,
continuously,
or
repeatedly
planned
for
the
future
of
their
child.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
think
only
the
former.
the
question
in
the
latter
context,
i
think,
embraces
more
directly
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
substantive
test,
and
i
think
a
challenge
to
that
ought
to
be
made
forthrightly.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
except
that
new
york
bifurcates
those
questions,
and
makes
the
final
revocation
at
a
dispositional
hearing
where
the
standard
is
merely
best
interests.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
whether
the
parents
and
the
state
engaged
in
conduct
or
failed
to
engage
in
conduct
which
justifies
the
termination
itself.
the
condition
precedent
to
the
order
terminating
rights
is
a
finding
by
the
court
based
on
an
historical
record
that
the
parents
did
or
did
not
do
something
and
that
the
agency
or
state
did
or
did
not
do
something,
and
i
think
justice
white's
question
embracing
the
second
component
goes
more
directly
to
a
substantive
challenge
to
a
standard.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
it
is
that
the
facts
have
to
be--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--enough.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no,
that
is
not
this
case.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes.
it
is
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
we
have
tests.
absolutely
yes.
but
we
want
the
finder
of
fact
to
be
convinced.
we
want
at
least
that
much.
this
is
fundamental
to
basic
notions
of
american
tradition,
that
you
can't
destroy
a
family
forever
when
you
are
not
convinced
that
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
think
an
examination
of
the
entire
scheme
is
appropriate,
but
i
think
that
in
any
case
where
the
finder
of
fact
is
convinced
no
more
than
the
evidence
is
probably
right,
no
more
that
would
justify
a
showing
that
somebody
struck
somebody
in
an
automobile
and
has
to
pay
damages.
it
just
isn't
enough,
and
justice
blackmun's
question
respecting
the
distinction
in
lassiter,
where
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
did,
it
said,
we
will
look
at
each
case
as
it
comes,
simply
cannot
be
done
in
this
context.
this
case
wouldn't
be
before
this
court
unless
there
was
a
substantial
question
that
the
constitution
requires
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
of
standard
of
proof,
certiorari
couldn't
even
be
brought
under...
to
this
court
to
review
the
record,
but
even
if
it
could,
or
if
the
appellate
courts
were
to
review
records,
you
can't
after
the
fact
judge
that,
well,
this
did
meet
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
but
somehow
that
is
not
enough
here.
that
is
not
the
way
law
is
made.
it
is
instead
in
this
kind
of
context,
the
allocation
of
risk
must
be
calibrated
in
advance.
the
degree
to
which
we
want
the
finder
of
fact
to
be
convinced
must
be
set
out
before
the
trial
takes
place
so
that
the
parties
know
in
what
framework
they
are
litigating.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
chief
justice
burger,
in
addington
against
texas,
i
believe,
wrote
that
we
may
never
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
we
do
know
that
there
is
a
difference.
we
do
know,
as
this
court
in
sumner
against
mather
just
last
term,
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
pointed
out
that
the
difference
between
overturning
a
conviction
based
upon
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
overturning
a
conviction
by
convincing
evidence,
as
section
2254(d)
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
requires,
means
something.
it
meant
enough
in
that
case
to
remand
for
the
specific
findings.
what
does
that
do?
that
heightens
the
pressure
or
the
critical
moment,
which
is
exactly
what
justice
harlan
in
winship
was
suggesting
ought
to
be
done,
when
you
interfere
with
fundamental
liberty,
on
the
finder
of
fact
to
express
precisely
what
and
how
the
judgment
is
justified,
so
that
appellate
courts
and
the
finder
of
fact
him
or
herself
is
satisfied.
we
don't
know
precisely
what
it
means,
but
we
certainly
know
in
the
multifaceted
ways
in
which
it
has
been
used
that
it
means
something.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
have
never
been
a
juror,
and
i
have
frankly
never
tried
a
case
of
that
kind,
but
i
would
think
that
it
has
potential
to
make
a
difference
in
every
case.
now,
it
may
be
that
a
juror
would
say,
i
don't
understand
the
difference,
but
i
don't
think
judges
say
that.
the
judge
certainly
didn't
say
that
in
winship.
this
court
didn't
say
that
in
sumner
against
monta.
it
does
make
a
difference,
i
think.
these
cases
are
non-jury
cases,
and
i
think
that
impressing
upon
judges
the
obligation
they
have
to
be
sure
of
their
result
is
an
important
one
and
a
meaningful
one.
comparing
this
kind
of
problem
with
the
problem
in
vance
against
terrazas
also
favorably
indicates
that
a
higher
standard
of
proof
is
necessary.
the
agency
only
need
show
the
everyday,
ordinary
facts
of
life
to
win
its
case,
unlike
in
terrazas,
the
heavy
burden
of
showing
purposeful,
voluntary
relinquishment
of
citizenship.
here,
the
question
is,
have
the
parents
visited,
and
when
i
suggested
that
the
standard,
justice
white,
for
making
the
determination
of
termination
includes
a
number
of
factors.
one
of
them
is
whether
they
planned.
that
was
the
one
in
this
case.
another
is
whether
they
visited.
another
is
whether
the
agency
has
utilized
diligent
efforts.
these
are
all
matters
in
the
agency's
knowledge,
within
the
agency's
records.
everyday,
ordinary
events.
and
when
we
permit
the
permanent
destruction
without
the
certainty
that
it
is
appropriate,
we
have
simply
not
measured
up
to
constitutional
rule.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
thank
you.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
the
question
of
the
rights
of
the
children
and
the
rights
of
the
parents
here
are,
as
justice
stevens
suggested
just
a
moment
ago,
before
the
court
in
the
same
context.
it
begs
the
question
to
suggest
that
their
interests
are
different.
they
may
be
and
they
may
not
be.
chief
justice
burger
indicated
in
questions
to
mr.
scavuzzo
that
judges
around
the
country,
commentators
have
told
us,
frequently
regard
the
decision
to
terminate
of
such
a
great
moment
that
they
want
to
be
convinced
that
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
before
they
do
it.
that
is
because,
if
it
is
true,
we
have
recognized
as
a
society
the
social
disutility
of
an
erroneous
permanent
destruction
of
a
family.
this
case
merely
would
suggest
that
that
social
disutility
is
of
constitutional
moment.
if,
as
chief
justice
burger
has
stated,
the
commentators
correctly
to
be
correct
and
people
are
doing
this
already,
then
very
little
is
lost
by
it.
but
if
people
are
not
doing
it,
if
children
are
being
destroyed
needlessly,
then
this
case
will
protect
them,
and
that
should
be
done.
even
where,
and
the
record
shows
this,
permanent
destruction
is
effected,
adoption,
which
could
be
the
only
feasible
benefit
accruing
to
the
children,
is
effected
only
about
40
percent
of
the
time.
so
we
have
children...
60
percent
of
the
time.
i
am
sorry.
forty
percent
of
the
cases,
permanent
adoption
is
not
effected
for
children
free
for
adoption
by
this
route.
so,
we
have
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
terminating
rights
where
it
benefits
children
at
best
a
preponderance
of
the
time.
the
constitution
requires
more.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
stop
at
this
point.
