the

case

no.
80-5889,
santosky
against
kramer.
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
appellate
division
of
supreme
court
of
new
york,
the
third
judicial
department.
under
new
york
law,
the
state
may
terminate,
over
parental
objection,
the
rights
of
parents
in
their
child
upon
a
finding
that
the
child
is
permanently
neglected.
the
state
statute
requires
that
only
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence
support
that
finding.
neglect
proceedings
were
brought
in
family
court
to
terminate
the
rights
of
the
petitioners
in
their
three
children.
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
but
the
court
weighed
the
evidence
under
that
standard
and
found
permanent
neglect,
and
after
a
subsequent
dispositional
hearing,
the
court
ruled
that
the
best
interests
of
the
children
required
termination
of
the
petitioners'
custody
and
the
appellate
division
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
process
is
constitutionally
due
a
natural
parent
at
a
state-initiated
parental
rights
termination
proceeding.
the
fundamental
liberty
interest
of
the
parents
in
the
care,
and
custody
of
their
child
is
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
when
the
state
moves
to
destroy
familial
bonds,
it
must
provide
the
parents
with
a
fundamentally
fair
procedure.
in
any
proceeding,
the
minimum
standard
of
proof
tolerated,
by
the
due
process
requirement
reflects
not
only
the
weight
of
the
public
and
private
interest
affected,
but
also
a
societal
judgment
about
how
the
risk
of
error
should
be
distributed
between
the
litigants.
we
hold
that
the
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
prescribed
by
the
new
york
standard
violates
the
due
process
clause.
the
private
interest
affected
is
commanding
and
the
threatened
loss
is
permanent.
a
preponderance
standard
does
not
fairly
allocate
the
risk
of
erroneous
fact
finding
between
the
state
on
the
one
hand
and
the
parents
on
the
other.
and
thus,
before,
state
may
sever
completely
and
irrevocably
the
rights
of
parents
in
their
natural
child,
due
process
requires
that
the
state
support
its
allegations
by
at
least
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
determination
of
the
precise
burden
equal
to
or
greater
than
that
standard
is
a
matter
of
state
law
properly
left
to
state
legislatures
and
state
courts.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
division
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice,
by
justice
white
and
by
justice
o'connor.
