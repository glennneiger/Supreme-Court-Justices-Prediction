mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
good
morning.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
requests
that
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
be
affirmed.
at
issue
before
the
court
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
comprehensive
state
plan
dealing
with
an
important
state
interest
in
an
area
of
domestic
relations
traditionally
regarded
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
new
york
permanent
neglect
statute
is
the
result
of
a
delicate
balancing
of
competing
and
intertwined
interests
between
multiple
parties
whose
rights
and
relationships
are
affected
by
all
the
branches
of
government.
we
don't
feel,
in
light
of
the
record
in
this
case,
that
a
different
standard
of
proof
would
vary
the
outcome.
however,
if
the
court
should
raise
the
burden,
it
would
frustrate
a
specific
intent
of
the
legislature.
in
1976,
there
was
commissioned
the
temporary
commission
on
child
welfare.
it
undertook
a
year-long
study.
these
results
are
published.
they
are
cited
extensively
throughout
robert
abrams'
brief,
the
attorney
general
for
new
york.
this
extensive
study
was
the
basis
for
the
present
law.
there
is
a
risk
of
error
here
which
petitioners
are
challenging
is
incorrect.
the
legislature
has
evaluated
this
very
risk
of
error.
its
conclusion,
based
on
that
year-long
study,
was
that
under
the
preponderance
standard,
the
risk
of
error
ran
considerably
in
favor
of
the
parent.
it
went
farther
than
that.
that
was
certainly
the
main
conclusion.
however,
it
also
determined
that
raising
the
burden
would
shorten
the
reach
of
the
statute,
which
is
precisely
what
the
legislature
did
not
want
to
do.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
the
legislature
extensively
evaluated
the
case
files
throughout
the
jurisdiction.
there
were
thousands
of
people
languishing
in
foster
care.
the
legislature...
of
that
set,
the
legislature
identified
a
specific
subset.
these
people,
it
felt,
could
not
be
reached
by
the
statute
under
a
clear
and
convincing
standard.
to
adopt
that
standard--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--the
main
conclusion
was
that
under
the
preponderance
standard,
the
risk
of
error
ran
considerably
in
favor
of
the
parent.
however,
it
also
felt
that
to
adopt
a
higher
standard
would
create
a
barrier
to
the
freeing
of
adoption.
that
was
precisely
what
it
did
not
want
to
do.
rather,
it
made
the
statute
more
specific,
set
out
the
grounds
for
permanent
neglect
in
much
greater
detail,
to
ensure
greater
accuracy
so
that
everyone
would
feel
comfortable
with
the
statute's
application.
the
legislature
did
feel
that
adopting
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
would
create
a
barrier
which
they
did
not
want.
it
cited
in
that
report--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--from
the
temporary--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--oh,
no.
the
legislature
adopted
the
new
law
based
upon
the
conclusions
in
that
temporary
commissions.
as
a
result
of
that
finding,
they
specifically
decided
to
raise
the
standard
to
clear
and
convincing
in
cases
where
both
parents,
due
to
their
mental
illness,
could
not
take
care
of
their
children
in
the
foreseeable
future,
but
they
specifically
decided
not
to
raise
the
standard
in
permanent
neglect
cases,
so
that
another
barrier
would
not
be
raised
to
the
adoption
of
these
children.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
the
legislature--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--the
legislature
felt
that
due
to
the
scientific
nature
of
the
testimony
involved
in
that
type
of
proceeding,
it
is
also
not
mental
illness
such
that
they
cannot
care
for
themselves
or
care
for
their
children
in
the
foreseeable
future.
the
legislature
felt
in
that
instance
that
the
parents
should
be
protected
due
to
the
nature
of
the
scientific
testimony
by
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
at
this
particular
time,
yes,
your
honor,
they
would
be.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
at
the
time
of
the
dispositional
hearing,
parental
rights
cannot
be
terminated
at
the
permanent
neglect
finding
which
petitioners
are
suggesting
now
is
unconstitutional.
there
is
a
dispositional
hearing
later
on
under
new
york
law.
at
that
time,
the
parents
had
two
children
living
in
the
home.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
to
the
judge
that
notwithstanding
the
previous
finding
of
permanent
neglect,
the
children
could
be
returned
home
in
the
foreseeable
future.
that
is,
conditions
in
the
home
had
changed
since
that
one-year
period
of
permanent
neglect.
they
had
that
opportunity
to
bring
in
the
precise
inference
that
the
two
children
being
in
the
home
now
would
raise.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
yes.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
no,
absolutely
not.
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
the
entire
package,
the
entire
package
of
rights
which
is
guaranteed
by
the
new
york
state
statute.
petitioners
are
challenging
only
one
particular
aspect
of
that
statute.
the
safeguard...
there
are
more
safeguards
under
this
type
of
permanent
neglect
statute
than
there
would
be
in
the
the
one
hearing
to
take
away
a
driver's
license.
there
is
in
this
case
an
initial
removal
proceeding,
where,
based
upon
a
finding
of
abuse
and
neglect,
the
child
is
removed
from
the
home.
again,
there
is
a
permanent
neglect
finding
which
the
petitioners
are
challenging
here,
but
rights
cannot
be
terminated
at
that
permanent
neglect
finding.
there
is
another
hearing.
at
that
other
hearing,
known
as
the
dispositional
hearing,
the
government
has
the
burden
again
to
show
that
notwithstanding
the
previous
finding,
the
children
cannot
be
returned
to
the
home.
there
is
also,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
direct
the
court's
attention
to
family
court
section
1061.
upon
good
cause
shown,
the
parents
may
move
to
vacate
any
order
of
the
family
court.
one
of
the
grounds
is
precisely
this
newly
discovered
evidence
that
petitioners
are
alluding
to
here,
so
they
do
have
another
opportunity.
they
certainly
have
the
opportunity
at
the
dispositional
hearing
to
present
further
evidence.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
under
1061,
they
can
move
to
attempt
to
vacate
that
order.
the
grounds,
however,
are
much
narrower.
it
would
be
newly
discovered
evidence,
fraud.
the
statute
spells
it
out.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
that's
correct.
the
procedure
that
i
am
suggesting
would
only--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--yes.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
it
would
be--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--no.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
not
in
the
cases
of
permanent
neglect.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
that
was
precisely
one
of
the
findings
of
the
new
york
state
legislature.
they
found
that
the
way
the
judges
were
applying
this
particular
preponderance
standard,
the
risk
of
error
ran
considerably
in
favor
of
the
parents,
and
that
to
raise
another
barrier
was
not
necessary
since
the
parents
were
already
protected,
and
number
two,
they
felt,
after
review
of
the
case
files,
it
would
eliminate
some
people
from
the
reach,
the
umbrella,
the
protection
of
the
statute,
and
they
wanted
the
specific
subset
to
be
within
the
reach
of
such
a
statute.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
no,
they
did
not.
it
would
be
much
too
complicated
to
evaluate
every
particular
safeguard
of
every
particular
statutory
scheme.
they
evaluated--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
legislature's
job,
the
only
job
they
could
undertake
with
any
type
of
certainty--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--the
entire
package,
how
does
the
statute
operate
as
the
whole,
what
is
the
risk
of
error
in
this
particular
jurisdiction--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--as
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--no,
because
that
would
place
the
burden
on
the
parents.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
certainly
under
new
york
law,
as
we
would
suggest
should
be
the
case,
the
burden
should
be
on
the
state
to
prove
that
the
family
cannot
be
reunited
in
the
foreseeable
future.
that
is
the
essence
of
this
law.
that
is
where
the
state
switches
roles.
the
initial
function
of
the
state
under
the
statute
is
to
reunite
the
family.
they
can
do
no
other.
at
some
point
in
time,
however,
the
agency,
checked
by
the
trial
judge,
has
to
make
a
determination
that
that
goal
is
no
longer
possible
and
that
the
children
cannot
be
returned
home
in
the
foreseeable
future.
it
is
only
at
that
point
does
the
state
have
the
right
to
go
in
and
terminate
those
rights.
again,
the
legislature
evaluated
how
that
precise
standard
operated
under
new
york
law,
and
came
to
the
conclusion,
the
well-reasoned
conclusion,
that
the
risk
of
error
still
ran
considerably
in
favor
of
the
parents.
the
substantive
grounds
based
here,
the
failure
to
plan,
are
neither
vague
nor
subjective.
they
are
specifically
defined
by
the
law.
that
failure
to
plan
for
the
child's
future
is
merely
the
failure
to
utilize
the
programs
and
services
which
are
available
to
the
particular
parent.
the
plan
relates
to
the
initial
problem.
there
should
be
no
question
here
there
was
an
initial
problem
in
the
santosky
home.
the
plan,
the
services
made
available
to
the
parents
are
then
utilized
to
solve
that
problem.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
parents
can
formulate
a
plan
of
their
own.
they
need
not
adopt
the
agency's
plan,
utilize
the
services
which
the
agency
offers
them.
a
good
example
is
the
facts
and
circumstances
here.
a
problem
in
the
santosky
home
was
economic.
mr.
santosky
was
unemployed.
ulster
county
offered
him
vocational
training,
which
he
participated
in
for
some
period
of
time.
later
on,
it
was
his
contention
that
he
would
be
better
served
by
working
under
the
supervision
of
a
relative
as
a
car
mechanic.
the
agency
had
no
objection
to
that
plan,
the
utilization
of
that
service
to
solve
his
problem.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
okay.
the
permanent
neglect
findings,
the
child
has
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
agency.
that
happens
at
an
initial
proceeding
before
the
family
court
where
the
state
proves
beyond
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
abuse
or
neglect
has
transpired
in
the
home.
the
child
is
then
removed
from
the
parents'
custody.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
it
would
be
that...
that
initial
finding
of
abuse
and
neglect
by
the
family
court.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
well,
the
system
operates
in
new
york,
these
cases
have
to
be
reported
to
the
agency.
there
was
approximately
70,000
reports
last
year
of
abuse--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--the
grandmother
of
mr.
santosky.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
that
was
tina.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
yes.
tina
was
initially
removed
in
1972
based...
she
had
some
severe
welts
on
her
backside.
she
was
taken
away
from
the
parents
for
three
weeks,
returned
back
from
the
home.
approximately
a
year
later,
more
problems
developed.
another
report
from
the
grandmother.
she
was
adjudicated
to
be
neglected.
there
was
a
finding
by
the
trial
judge
that
abuse
had
transpired
in
the
santosky
home.
she
was
kept
away
for
a
period
of
approximately
eight
months,
and
returned
home
on
a
trial
basis.
the
agency
recognized
that
there
are
specific
problems
when
a
child
is
removed
for
more
than
one
year.
they
tried
to
avoid
that
problem
here,
returned
tina
to
the
home
on
a
trial
basis.
she
was
home
for
about
two
months
when
there
were
other
abuse
problems,
which
we
have
described
in
our
brief,
to
john
the
second.
ulster
county
in
this
case
did
everything
possible,
offered
every
service
that
could
have
been
made
available
to
the
santoskys,
psychological
counseling,
psychiatric
counseling,
educational
service,
vocational
training,
nutritional,
homemaker
service,
family
counseling,
every
possible
service
was
urged
upon
them
by
ulster
county.
not
all
of
those
services
have
to
be
accepted
by
the
parent.
a
good
indication
of
that
is
the
first
termination
proceeding
of
parental
rights,
which
the
government
lost,
in
november
of
1976.
it
is
a
good
indication
of
how
well
parental
rights
are
protected
by
the
trial
judges
in
new
york
state.
the
legislature
by
that
survey
indicated
they
had
a
tremendous
amount
of
confidence
in
our
trial
judges.
this
survey,
this
commission
determined
that
under
the
preponderance
standard,
parental
rights
were
more
than
adequately
protected.
it
is
evidenced
here.
one
government
witness
testified
after
approximately
three
months
of
seeing
the
santoskys.
this
was
in
1976.
the
children
had
been
away
from
the
home
for
approximately
two
years.
the
government
witness
testified
that,
yes,
they
were
making
some
type
of
movement,
they
were
benefitting
from
our
service,
and
mr.
and
mrs.
santosky
took
the
stand
and
felt,
yes,
they
had
received
the
benefit
from
the
service.
that
was
enough
for
the
trial
judge
to
say,
yes,
these
people
are
utilizing
the
services.
they
are
taking
advantage
of
them,
and
thus
planning
for
the
future
of
their
children
under
new
york
law.
that
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the
second
termination
proceeding
in
february
of
1979.
the
government
witness,
the
family
counselor,
who
said
in
november
of
1976,
yes,
there
is
hope
that
this
family
can
be
put
back
together,
finally,
even
she
gave
up
hope.
and
the
santoskys
never
took
the
stand
themselves
to
testify.
certainly
at
that
time
they
had
the
opportunity
to
offer
any
type
of
evidence
that
they
would
utilize
these
services,
deriving
some
type
of
benefit
from
programs
that
were
being
offered
to
them,
and
they
failed
to
do
so.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
well,
of
those
complaints.
not
all
of
those
cases
the
agency
has
the
funding
to
investigate.
they
open
up
a
file
in
only
some
of
them.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
no.
the
agency
acts
in
approximately
10
percent
of
those
cases.
we
are
talking
about
approximately...
i
have
laid
out
the
statistics
as
well
as
we
can
determine
them
in
our
exhibits.
we
are
speaking
about
approximately
7,000
initial
custody
or
removal
proceedings,
which
the
agency
indicates.
the
1,200
number
is
the
permanent
neglect,
the
termination
proceedings
which
the
agency
eventually
decides
to--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
if
the
court
is
interested,
i
would
be
happy
to
provide
that
information.
the
evidence,
the
failure
to
utilize
those
services,
indicated
a
state
of
mind
of
the
parents,
that
these
parents
had
virtually
abandoned
their
children
at
that
termination
proceeding
in
april
of
1979.
the
trial
court
described
their
meetings
between
parent
and
child
as
devoid
of
any
type
of
emotional
contact.
the
children
viewed
those
meetings
as
something
merely
to
be
endured.
throughout
the
course...
this
is
six
years...
before
the
same
trial
judge,
as...
that's
the
practice;
once
the
initial
removal
proceeding
is
instituted,
the
case
remains
before
the
same
trial
judge,
who
takes
judicial
notice
of
all
the
prior
proceedings...
the
santoskys
never
asked
when
their
children
would
be
returned
home
permanently.
judge
elwin
based
his
decision,
as
he
had
to
under
new
york
law,
on
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
however,
the
strength
of
his
decision
is
not...
his
decision
is
not
one
of
a
man
who
had
any
reservations
about
his
factual
findings.
he
asserted
that
the
santoskys'
failure
to
utilize
these
services
was
total
and
complete.
their
miniscule
efforts
had
tapered
off
to
the
point
where
he
could
not
even
measure
them
as
an
experienced
trial
judge.
it
has
been
nine
years
since
the
initial
abuse
of
tina,
and
this
case
cries
out
to
be
ended.
i
would
like
to
close
with
the
contention
that
there
is
a
logical
fallacy
in
petitioner's
argument.
they
are
isolating
their
whole
challenge
on
a
comprehensive,
very
well
thought
out
state
scheme
on
only
one
particular
procedural
protection
in
the
entire
statute.
the
statute,
with
all
those
protections,
all
those
hearings,
has
to
be
evaluated
as
a
whole.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
procedural
protections.
the
parents
must
come
before
a
neutral
and
disinterested
magistrate
at
least
three
times
before
their
parental
rights
are
terminated.
again,
the
legislature
evaluated
precisely
the
risk
of
error
under
that
package,
and
determined
that
it
ran
considerably
in
favor
of
the
parent.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
certainly
it
is--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--no,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
fundamental
liberty
interest.
however--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
even
if
the
right
is
viewed
in
the
abstract
as
fundamental,
it
is
mitigated.
it
is
distinguished
from
those
other
fundamental
liberty
cases.
it
is
distinguishable
by
the
interests
of
the
children
here
involved,
that
is
across
the
country,
and
specifically
under
new
york
law
the
length
of
time
that
that
child
has
been
away
from
the
home,
that
mitigates
the
parental
interest.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
oh,
yes.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
oh,
new
york
regards
this
as
an
extremely
important
liberty
interest.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
not
fundamental.
they
feel
it
is
protected
adequately
by
the
procedural
safeguards
which
they
have
developed
in
their
statutory
package.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
the
issue
at
what
point
does
the
state
determine
when
the
family
cannot
be
reunited
in
the
foreseeable
future,
someone
has
to
make
that
evaluation.
the
question
is,
under
what
standard.
the
agency,
when
it
begins,
when
the
child
is
initially
removed
from
the
home,
must
bring...
put
that
child...
do
everything
possible
it
can
to
put
the
child
back
in
the
home.
it
can
act
in
no
other
fashion.
if
it
does,
the
parents
have
a
right
to
file
a
petition
to
terminate
placement.
however,
there
is
a
balancing
here
of
the
interests
of
the
child.
not
in
all
cases
can
the
statutory
obligation
be
met.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
yes.
no
question
that
the--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
precisely
the
evaluation
which
new
york
state
undertook
in
1976.
the
question--
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
stephen
scavuzzo
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
