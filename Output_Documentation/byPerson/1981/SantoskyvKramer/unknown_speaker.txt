unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
guggenheim,
i
realize
that
your
point
is
certainly
legally
well
taken,
but
do
you
think
your
client
would
have
been
better
served
by
the
rather
searching
family
court
inquiries
in
this
case;
albeit
they
were
said
to
be
made
upon
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rather
than
a
very
short
hearing
in
the
family
court
which
announced
that
it
found
by
"clear
and
convincing
evidence"
that
parental
rights
should
be
terminated
and
it
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
division?
unknown
speaker
no,
my
question
was
directed
more
to
the
practicality
matter.
the
family
court
devoted
considerable
time,
and
wrote
out
its
conclusions,
and
held
more
than
one
hearing
on
the
matter,
and
the
fact
that
it
ended
up
concluding
that
it
was
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
strikes
me
as
being
a
rather
technical
point
which
could
have
been
obviated
by
a
much
shorter
and
less
searching
inquiry
than
simply
a
boilerplate
finding
at
the
end
that
we
find
this
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
unknown
speaker
from
the
size
of
the
record
in
this
case,
is
it
not
quite
clear
that
the
judge
gave
it
very
close
attention,
and
made
an
exhaustive
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
mr.
guggenheim,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
about
the
standard,
what
should
we
do
with
this
case?
send
this
record
back
and
tell
them,
look
at
this
record
again
and
applying
the
correct
standard,
or
to
retry
it?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
trial
record.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest
that
the
judge
didn't
consider
them.
unknown
speaker
that
he
didn't
consider
them?
unknown
speaker
given
the
amount
of
time,
the
whole
record
of
this
case,
if
you
are
correct
on
your
standard,
would
not
the
appropriate...
would
it
not
spare
this
family
unit
that
you
are
concerned
about,
very
properly,
considerable
trauma
if
they
didn't
have
to
go
through
the
whole
process
again,
if
the
judge
would
merely
be
directed
to
evaluate
this
evidence
on
the
standard
that
you
are
suggesting
if
the
court
should
happen
to
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
the
appellate
division,
not
the--
unknown
speaker
--court
of
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
wait
until
the
matter
is
cleared
up.
perhaps
a
lightbulb.
0....
the
first
surmise
was
correct.
counsel,
you
may
continue.
unknown
speaker
we
will
not
deduct
that
time
from
mr.
guggenheim's
allotted
30
minutes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
guggenheim,
under
new
york
law,
suppose
the
state
fails
to
get
an
order
terminating
parental
rights.
unknown
speaker
may
it
come
back
later
and
seek
such
an
order?
unknown
speaker
suppose...
the
state
may,
but
suppose
the
parents
lose,
and
parental
rights
are
terminated.
have
they
any
way
of
getting
parental
rights
restored?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
was
the
last
time
your
clients
saw
those
three
children?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
must
concede,
mr.
guggenheim,
that
new
york
does
have
some
advantages
in
its
system
that
other
states
do
not
have.
unknown
speaker
i
am
speaking
of
the
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
a
representative
of
the
child.
i
forget
what
you
call
it.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
this
court
in
lassiter
last
year
said
that
the
right
to
counsel
was
not
constitutionally
mandated.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were
some
of
us
who
thought
it
didn't
follow.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
mr.
guggenheim,
what
provision...
you
are
urging
us
to
say
a
state
must
do
something
in
this
context.
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
on
what
part
of
it?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
question
of
procedural
due
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
arguing,
then,
or
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
some
right
to
family,
some
family
right
that
is
being
violated
here?
unknown
speaker
liberty?
unknown
speaker
you
have
spoken
to
the
rights
of
the
parents
here,
and
of
course
that
is
very
important,
but
is
there
not
a
right
which
is
more
important
than
the
right
of
the
parents,
namely,
the
right
of
the
child,
or
the
children?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
standard
that
was
applied
here?
i
mean,
what
was
the
substantive
rule
that
was
applied
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
is
it
your
contention
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
apply
to
the
findings
of
historical
fact,
who
did
what
to
whom,
or
who
said
what,
or
what
actions
people
take?
is
that
what
you
are
talking
about?
or
are
you
talking
about
the
conclusion
from
these
facts
that
this
standard
has
been
violated?
or
both?
unknown
speaker
by
the
latter,
do
you
mean
the
conclusion
that
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
or
the
children
to
be
separated
from
the
parent?
that
is
the
ultimate
conclusion,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
as
to
which
of
these
do
you
direct
your
claim
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
your
contention
was.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
urge
us
to
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
to
this
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
historical
facts
add
up
to--
unknown
speaker
--to
enough?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
guggenheim,
under
the
answer
you
have
just
given,
would
circumstantial
evidence
ever
be
enough
under
your
standard
of
clear
and
convincing
then?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
mr.
guggenheim,
isn't
it
ultimately
perhaps
more
important
to
look
at
the
overall
scheme
and
requirements
for
severance
of
parental
rights
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
fundamentally
fair
scheme
for
handling
the
problem
than
to
simply
apply
an
artificial
standard
of
proof,
without
an
examination
of
the
entire
scheme?
unknown
speaker
what
in
practice
is
the
difference
between
the
standard
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
the
standard
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
unknown
speaker
but
say
in
a
charge
to
the
jury
in
a
fraud
case,
which
is
typically
clear
and
convincing
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
it
really
makes
much
difference
whether
they
are
charged
that
they
must
find
fraud
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
or
by
a
preponderance?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
unknown
speaker
so
you
really...
i
take
it
the
state's
position
is,
yes,
there
is
indeed
a
difference
between
preponderance
and
clear
and
convincing,
in
terms
of
actual
results.
at
least
that
was
the
conclusion
of
your
committee.
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
that
from
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
a
post-legislative
history
analysis?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
again
how
you
justified
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
where
you
ask
clear
and
convincing
evidence
for
a
mental
disability
but
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
another
question.
we
are
concerned
primarily
with
three
children
here,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
these
people
have
two
others,
younger.
unknown
speaker
has
the
state
ever
moved
on
them?
unknown
speaker
are
you
in
a
position
then
that
they
are
unfit
to
handle
the
three
older
ones
but
not
unfit
to
handle
the
two
younger
ones?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
parents
are
older,
and
the
family
is
smaller
with
two
than
it
would
be
with
five.
on
the
other
hand,
if
one
takes
away...
if
the
state
takes
away
a
driver's
license
in
the
state
of
new
york,
it
is
on
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
more
important
than
taking
away
children?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
scavuzzo,
once
at
the
dispositional
hearing
there
is
an
order
terminating
parental
rights,
that
is
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
can
the
parents
come
back
and
attack
that
order?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
state
loses,
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
may
initiate
another
termination
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
the
parents
have
any
attack
at
all
open
to
them
on
a
termination
order,
it
is
only
this
limited
one
that
you
mentioned--
unknown
speaker
--the
newly
discovered
fraud
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
many
like
that
under
new
york
practice?
unknown
speaker
any?
unknown
speaker
as
you
know,
counsel,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
writing
on
this
subject
by
people
who
purport
to
be
students
of
it,
and
many
of
them
have
said
that
as
a
practical
matter,
judges
do
not
remove
custody
in
this
way
unless
they
are
fully
convinced,
which
certainly
implies
that
the
evidence
is
clear
and
it
is
convincing
to
the
judge,
and
that
it
is
probably
more
than
a
preponderance.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
did
the
commission
look
at
the
laws
of
other
states?
did
they
make
a
survey
of
the
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
some
30
or
more
states
with
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
cases
like
this.
unknown
speaker
to
deal
with
the
new
york
situation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
scavuzzo,
may
i
ask
a
question
here?
in
your
brief,
you
suggest
that
the
right
at
stake
here
is
comparable
to
the
right
in
a
licensing
procedure
or
various
property
cases,
and
that
one
should
weigh
the
burden
of
proof
as
part
of
the
total
package
of
procedures,
and
if
the
entire
procedure
is
fair,
burden
of
proof
isn't
very
important.
supposing
the
burden
of
proof
for
probable
cause,
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
the
children
would
be
better
off
in
the
foster
home.
would
that
be
constitutional
in
your
judgment,
if
all
the
other
procedures
you
can
think
of
were
given
to
protect
the
parents?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
would
that
be
constitutional
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
may
well
be...
well,
anyway,
you
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
what
is
wrong
with
placing
the
burden
on
the
parents
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
if
they
have
all
the
other
procedures
and
protections
you
talk
about?
unknown
speaker
mr.
scavuzzo,
how
do
these
cases
originate?
unknown
speaker
but
to
go
back
one
step,
i
mean,
presumably
90
percent
of
the
families
in
new
york
never
get
into
this
mill.
what
is
the
first
step
that
gets
them
into
this
procedure?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
find...
who
detects
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
reported
it
in
this
instance?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
way
the
whole
thing
started?
the
grandmother
complained?
unknown
speaker
what
initiated
that
was
some
injuries
to
the
children,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
happen
to
know
how
much
the
new
york
state
budget
is
to
deal
with
all
these
problems?
unknown
speaker
you
said
there
were
70,000
complaints
of
maltreatment
last
year,
so
i
suppose
there
is
an
enormous
expense
in
the
investigatory
aspect
of
those
complaints.
unknown
speaker
well,
70,000
complaints
means
that
someone
has
got
to
make
some
inquiry
in
those
cases,
does
it
not.
unknown
speaker
and
you
said
about
1,200
a
year
are
cases
where
the
children
are
taken
away
from
the
parents?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
know
the
total
cost
of
this
care
of
these
children,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
scavuzzo,
is
it
not
still
critical
to
your
argument
that
the
termination
of
parental
rights
does
not
involve
a
fundamental
liberty
interest?
unknown
speaker
that
is
where
you
start
your
main
argument
in
your
brief,
at
least.
unknown
speaker
would
you
concede
the
termination
is
a
fundamental
liberty
interest
and
nevertheless
make
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
you
rest
your
whole
argument
on
that
premise,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
your
argument
is
that
you
stress
the
fact
that
it
is
new
york
policy
to
presume
that
the
natural
parent-child
relationship
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
there
is
that
kind
of
a
presumption
that
runs
throughout
your
statutory
scheme.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
tend
to
support
the
notion
that
new
york
regards
this
as
a
rather
important
liberty
interest?
unknown
speaker
but
not
fundamental.
unknown
speaker
well,
new
york
could
regard
it
as
important
both
for
the
parents
and
for
the
children,
and
when
they
come
to
cross
purposes,
perhaps
neither
one
would
have
a
"fundamental
right".
the
issue
is
whether
they
are
at
cross
purposes
or
not.
that
is
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
in
all
cases
at
the
beginning
of
the
proceeding,
because
you
must
meet
a
preponderance
standard,
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
interest
of
the
child
is
to
remain
with
his
parents.
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
much
difference
whether
we
call
it
a
fundamental
right
or
use
some
other
adjective
if...
is
not
the
question
whether,
taken
as
a
whole,
the
procedure
gives
paramount
status
to
the
interest
of
the
children?
unknown
speaker
you
think
they
do
that
with
a
preponderance
standard
then.
unknown
speaker
plus
the
other
protections.
