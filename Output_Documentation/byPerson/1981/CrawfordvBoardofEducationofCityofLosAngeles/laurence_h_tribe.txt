mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
to
the
court
a
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
upholding
an
amendment
to
the
california
constitution.
proposition
one
enacted
a
special
statewide
election
to,
and
i
quote
from
the
analysis
of
the
legislative
analyst,
"limit
the
power
of
california
courts
to
require
desegregation.
"
proposition
one
expressly
linked--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--clearly
they
wanted
to
link
it
to
the
federal
standards.
what
is
intriguing
about
the
case
is
whether
it
is
permissible
for
a
state,
in
its
constitution
which
provides
generous
protection
for
educational
equality
across
the
board,
to
single
out
the
right
not
to
be
subject
to
what
the
california
courts
have
called
racial
isolation,
and
to
single
it
out
by
saying
that
as
to
that
right,
the
only
remedies
available
are
those
that
a
federal
court,
in
the
same
circumstances,
would
order.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
permissible,
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
the
states
wanted
to
cut
back
on
their
equal
protection
clause
in
a
neutral
way,
and
to
say,
in
general,
they
will
not
go
beyond
the
federal
constitution,
that
would
surely
be
permissible.
the
state
of
california
has
not
done
that.
the
state
of
california,
as
the
decision
below
expressly
holds,
continues
to
create
rights
to
be
free
of
racially
segregated
schooling
regardless
of
cause
broader
than
the
rights
that
are
conferred
under
federal
law.
the
rights,
substantively,
have
been
completely
unchanged
by
proposition
one.
moreover,
the
court
below
held
that
the
duty
on
the
school
board
to
take
affirmative
steps,
including
mandatory
pupil
reassignment
if
and
when
necessary,
remains.
what
is
now
different,
and
it
is
different
only
with
respect
to
desegregation,
not
with
respect
to
school
finance
or
any
other
area.
what
is
different
is
that
with
respect
to
school
desegregation
now,
after
proposition
one,
one
cannot
use
the
courts
of
california
to
get
any
and
all
necessary
remedies.
one
must
limit
oneself
to
those
remedies
that
a
federal
court,
with
all
of
the
institutional
limits
on
federal
courts,
would
order
in
that
very
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
is
analogous,
i
think,
to
a
state
racially
specific
norris
laguardia
act
that
says
in,
for
example,
racial
labor
disputes,
as
opposed
to
other
labor
disputes,
the
state
courts
cannot
enter
certain
remedies
unless
federal
courts
would
do
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
closest
analogy
is
really
in
this
case
clearly
hunter
v.
erickson,
but
in
a
way
this
case
is
a
lot
worse
than
hunter
v.
erickson
for
this
reason:
what
is
important
in
this
case
is
not
the
sort
of
education
that
the
petitioners,
the
minority
students
of
los
angeles,
are
receiving
or
will
receive
as
a
result
of
proposition
one.
that
matters
in
the
world,
but
the
legal
issue
here
is
somewhat
narrower.
the
legal
issue
here
is
not
even
the
degree
of
racial
isolation
and
separation
to
which
petitioners
will
be
fated
by
virtue
of
proposition
one.
the
issue
is
the
special
way
in
which
proposition
one
creates
a
two-track
judicial
system
in
california,
a
dual
court
system
in
which
only
those
seeking
redress
from
racial
isolation
in
violation
of
state
law
must
be
satisfied
with
less
than
full
relief
from
a
state
court.
they
must,
instead,
persuade
the
school
board,
which
is
typically
the
defendant
in
the
case,
the
entity
said
to
be
in
default
of
their
continuing
obligations
under
state
law,
that
the
school
board
has
been
remiss
in
not
ordering
certain
remedies.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
and
indeed,
justice
white,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
it
is
so
plain
that
it
is
a
racial
specific
classification.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
bears
almost
no
resemblance,
in
our
view,
to
the
washington
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
under
state
law,
justice
white,
it
may
have
a
duty
even
without
de
jure
and
that
continues.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
although
the
court
below--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
white,
i
don't
think
so.
if
i
may
quote
from
the
court
below
at
page
510
of
the
california
reporter
version--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
the
petition
for
cert
in
the...
could
i
have
that
for
a
moment?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
i
could
just
read,
it
is
a
very
brief
passage,
justice
renquist,
so
let
me
read
it.
"this
right",
the
court
is
talking
about
the
broader
right,
"recognized
in
crawford
has
not
been
removed
by
proposition
one,
which
does
not
purport
to
change
the
duty--
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--under
state.
so
what
we
have
here
is
not
the
destruction
of
a
right
or
the
changing
of
a
duty,
as
this
court
held
only
last
month
in
laverne.
the
fact
that
a
state
may
be
free
to
remove
a
right
or
remove
a
duty,
does
not
mean
that
it
has
the
same
freedom
to
leave
the
right
in
place
but
simply,
in
a
discriminatory
way
we
argue,
provide
less
than
full
judicial
remedy.
the
way
proposition
one
is
written,
it
distinguishes...
it
singles
out,
let
me
quote
from
the
solicitor
general,
i
think
there
is
an
accurate
rendition
of
it
in
this
brief,
"it
singles
out
a
right
afforded
california
school
children
under
state
law,
admittedly,
to
attend
schools
free
of
racial
isolation,
whatever
the
cost,
and
subjects
that
right
to
an
unusual
judicial
process
that
make
its
protection
substantially
more
difficult
than
protection
of
other
state
rights.
"
"for
example--
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
cuts
the
right
back
completely.
it
would
be
a
very
different
and
more
difficult,
justice
white.
there
would
still
be
one
argument--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--you
are
supposed
to
try
to
enforce
it
by
going
to
the
other
side.
the
referee
is
replaced
with
the
other
team.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
are
under
an
obligation,
a
duty
to
desegregate.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
there
is
nothing
one
can
do
to
review
in
the
courts
of
california.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
supposedly
have
a
duty
to
do
it.
but
now,
unlike
other
state
duties,
this
one
can't
be
enforced
in
the
courts
of
california.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
renquist,
there
are
two
answers
that
i
have
to
that.
the
first
is
that
in
this
court's
approach,
for
example,
to
procedural
due
process
cases,
it
has
drawn
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
state's
destruction
of
an
interest
and
the
state's
statement
to
someone,
"you
have
this
interest
property",
let
us
say,
"but
we
will
not
give
you
any
hearing
to
protect
it.
"
this
court
has
said,
it
is
a
matter
of
fourteenth
amendment
law...
once
the
state
confers
and
continues
to
protect
the
right
by
saying
that
you
have
it,
it
is
a
matter
of
fourteenth
amendment
law
what
remedies
are
adequate
for
its
enforcement.
i
want
to
make
this
second
point.
even
if
it
were
true
that
the
state
of
california
had
taken
the
further
step,
which
it
denies
it
has
taken
and
which
the
court
below
denies,
and
had
surgically
removed
racial
segregation
from
the
list
of
wrongs
in
the
educational
world
as
to
which
california
law
provides
a
more
generous
standard
by
not
inquiring
into
cause,
and
by
allowing
a
broad
range
of
remedies,
including
inter-district
remedies,
that
would
truly
have
been
the
withdrawal
on
a
race
specific
basis,
not
on
a
neutral
basis,
of
one
right
and
one
right
only.
that
seems
to
me,
under
hunter
v.
erickson,
this
court
is
not
necessarily
prepared
to
counternance.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
is
not
right,
justice
renquist,
it
can
go
back.
if
the
state
were
to
do
something
specially
for
race,
we
do
not
deny
that
it
could
take
that
back.
if
the
state
were
to
say,
equal
educational
opportunity
across-the-board
is
crucial,
so
that
when
it
is
denied,
we
don't
care
if
it
is
de
facto
or
de
jure,
and
were
to
give
that
broad
panoply
of
rights,
and
then
were
to
say,
but
now
we
are
going
to
take
it
back
from
one
group,
racial
minorities,
that
would
raise
a
different
problem.
it
is
not
a
one-way
ratchet.
it
is
simply
that
if
the
state
decides
to
take
something
back
from
minorities
only,
when
it
has
given
on
a
broader
basis,
that
raises
a
facially
racial
classification.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
crawford
relied
also
on
serrano
v.
priest
in
which
the
california
court
had
compared
its
approach
expressly
in
the
areas
of
inequality
of
school
finance
and
racial
inequality.
it
had
said
that
it
saw
no
reason
to
treat
them
differently.
the
federal
court,
out
of
reason
of
deference
to
the
states,
the
federal
court
might,
for
example,
not
want
to
provide
inter-district
remedies,
but
there
is
no
reason
for
the
states
to
worry
about
deferring
to
themselves.
the
federal
courts
might
worry
about
proof
of
causation,
but
as
far
as
state
law
was
concerned
equality
of
educational
opportunity,
when
education
was
made
a
fundamental
right
in
california,
was
so
basic
that
it
really
didn't
matter
whether
there
was
a
deliberate
decision
to
deny
equality.
so
the
earlier
crawford
decision,
building
on
a
decision
that
the
california
supreme
court
called
jackson--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
is
right,
and
then
serrano
relied
on
jackson
and
said,
"we
think
that
it
is
a
broad
principle
of
california's
fundamental
rights
law
with
respect
to
education.
"
but
in
any
event,
i
think
it
is
important
to
get
back
to
the
point
that
here
it
is
not
just
a
denial
of
a
right.
indeed,
the
court
below
rejected
the
petitioner's
attempt
to
show
that
one
of
the
things
that
was
wrong
here
was
that
a
vested
right
might
have
been
taken
away.
the
court
below
said,
"no,
the
right
is
the
same.
"
"it
is
just
that
this
right,
unlike
other
rights,
can't
be
fully
enforced.
"
in
hunter
v.
erickson,
the
crucial
racial
distinction
that
was
drawn,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
was
not
between
blacks
and
whites,
not
between
various
groups
of
people,
religious
or
racial.
the
crucial
distinction
that
was
drawn,
the
court
said,
was
between
racial
housing
matters
and
other
racial
and
housing
matters.
so
that
the
example
that
this
court
gave
was
that
those
people,
for
example,
who
wanted
to
pass
rent
control
laws,
or
laws
increasing
protection
from
negligent
landlords
or
building
codes,
had
an
easier
time
vindicating
their
goals
through
the
state's
legal
system
than
did
those
people
who
wanted
to
end
racial
discrimination
in
housing.
what
this
measure
does,
without
any
doubt,
on
its
face
since
it
refers
to
school
integration,
when
talking
about
what
school
boards
can
voluntarily
do...
what
it
does
without
any
doubt
is
create
a
special
obstacle,
not
just
to
translating
goals
of
racial
equality
into
not
yet
existent
law
that
doesn't
apply
elsewhere,
but
a
special
obstacle
to
vindicating
state
created
rights
of
racial
equality
which
does
not
apply
when
one
is
trying
to
vindicate
state
created
rights
of
educational
equality
in
the
financial
area,
in
decisions
like
serrano.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
right
to
say
that
racial
animus
must
be
shown
in
a
case
like
this.
indeed,
in
washington
v.
davis
itself,
this
court
approvingly
cited
hunter
v.
erickson
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
law
on
its
face
creates
a
racial
classification
that
imposes
a
greater
obstacle
to
racial
minorities,
or
to
minority
rights,
than
it
does
in
other
analogous
areas,
at
that
point
one
doesn't
need
to
take
the
next
step
and
show
discriminatory
intent.
indeed,
justice
powell
in
his
bakke
decision
distinguished
arlington
v.
heights
from
an
explicit
racial
classification.
the
only
relevant
intent
for
fourteenth
amendment
purposes
is
the
intent
to
treat
race
differently.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
o'connor,
my
view
is,
based
on
the
decision
below,
that
it
would
not.
at
least
seven
times,
the
court
of
appeal
in
this
case
said
that
proposition
one
restricts
the
use
of
california's
courts
for
pupil
reassignment
only
for
purposes
of
desegregation.
the
school
board
itself
its
opposition
to
certiorari
in
this
court
said
at
page
9
that
proposition
one
addresses
but
one
narrow
area,
the
power
of
a
state
court
to
order
student
assignment
as
a
desegregation
remedy.
the
other
respondent
in
this
case
puts
that
as
the
question
presented,
whether
a
race
specific
remedy
is
even
permissible
under
the
constitution.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
were
no
findings
below,
because
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
thought
that
since
a
federal
court
would
have
ordered
desegregation
proposition
one
didn't
matter.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
conduct
any
hearings--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
there
are
two
ways
that
we
can
win
in
this
case,
justice
white.
one
is
to
convince
you
that
since
this
is
an
explicit
racial
classification
which
imposes
an
obstacle
to
the
vindication
of
minority
rights,
intent
is
irrelevant.
we
believe
that's
clearly
right
and
i
want
to
refer
to
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
discriminatory
in
the
sense
of
intent
to
have
a
disparate
and
adverse
impact
on
a
racial
minority,
not
necessarily
out
of
animus
and
not
simply
as
opposed
to
sleepwalking,
but
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
just
a
statistical
connection
with
race.
obviously,
when
race
is
present
on
the
face
of
the
law...
we're
not
dealing
with
an
arlington
heights
situation
or
a
washington
v.
davis
situation,
in
which
a
seemingly
innocent
act
happens
to
have
an
adverse
impact
on
a
racial
group.
when
you
have
explicit
racial
classification,
as
you
do
here,
the
relevant
purpose
is
already
conclusively
demonstrated.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
racial
classification
here
is
between
rights
to
reduce
racial
inequality
in
california
schools
and
other
rights
relating
to
the
educational
system
in
california.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
initiative
specifically
says
that
it
shall
not
be
construed
to
prevent
a
school
board
from
engaging
voluntarily
in
integration.
so
that
this
initiative
deals
with
integration
on
its
face,
integration
and
desegregation.
at
the
same
time,
the
official
legislative
analysis
that
accompanied
it
stated
that
its
concern
was
desegregation.
the
solicitor
general
says
it
is
indeed
race
specific
in
the
sense
that
it's
focused
on
the
problem
of
racial
isolation
in
california's
schools.
but
even
if
it
were
true
that
by
accident
a
law
plainly
designed
on
its
face,
since
it
speaks
to
integration,
to
create
special
limits
on
the
use
of
california's
courts
in
the
desegregation
area
might
happen
to
have
a
spillover
effect
and
might
happen,
i
would
submit
quite
inadvertently,
to
interfere
with
racial...
with
school
assignments
in
the
area
of
handicapped
or
overcrowding,
even
if
that
were
to
happen
that
would
not
in
any
way
affect
the
proposition
that
a
clear
and
explicit
line
is
nonetheless
drawn
between
racial
inequality
in
california
schools
and,
for
example,
economic
inequality,
something
the
california
courts
had
treated
as
entirely
analogous.
justice
rehnquist
asked
in
the
seattle
case
whether
it
wasn't
true,
in
hunter
v.
erickson,
that
only
fair
housing
ordinances
were
subject
to
the
referendum
requirement.
well,
indeed,
it
wasn't
quite
true.
it
was
argued
by
the
city
of
akron
in
its
brief
and
it
was
undisputed,
in
its
brief
in
this
court,
that
some
other
ordinances,
including
taxation
ordinances,
for
example,
ordinances
raising
taxes,
also
had
to
be
subjected
to
referendum.
so
it
couldn't
be
said
literally
that
the
line
put
race
and
only
race
on
one
side
and
everything
else
on
the
other.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
this
particular
charter
amendment
did,
and
we
submit
that
the
correct
way
of
reading
proposition
one
is
that
it
does
and
the
court
below
so
read
it.
but
i
was
suggesting
earlier
that
there
was
another
way
to
win
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
that
before
i
amplify
the,
we
think,
serious
and
rather
unique
constitutional
defect
in
proposition
one.
and
that
is,
with
respect
to
arlington
heights,
not
only
was
there
no
determination
of
any
kind
about
racially
impermissible
impact
and
purpose
by
the
trial
court,
because
it
didn't
think
proposition
one
was
even
an
issue
in
the
case,
but
the
court
of
appeals
conducted
no
inquiry
remotely
resembling
what
the
court
required
in
arlington
heights.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
a
sufficient
answer
to
all
of
our
allegations
and
all
of
the
evidence
that
we
had
yet
to
introduce
to
any
tribunal,
but
that
is
in
this
record,
a
sufficient
answer
that
in
its
face
there
was
written
into
proposition
one
a
non-racial
purpose.
well,
my
goodness,
if
that's
all
it
takes
to
satisfy
arlington
heights,
if
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
in
the
law,
we're
not
trying
to
do
this
because
of
race,
then
arlington
heights
becomes
a
meaningless
precedent.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
say
that
because
the
proposition
could
have
been
motivated
by
considerations
other
than
race,
it
would
necessarily
be
too
speculative
to
conduct
a
hearing
on
how
in
fact
it
was
motivated.
surely
that's
not
the
standard
that
this
court
laid
down
in
arlington
heights.
at
a
minimum,
therefore,
if
the
court
were
not
to
agree
that
this
is
an
impermissible
explicit
racial
classification
violative
of
hunter,
there
would
have
to
be
either
a
remand
under
arlington
heights
or
a
determination
that
on
this
record
this
is
so
plainly
designed
to
restrict
desegregation,
not
just
to
restrict
racial
balance
but
to
restrict
the
use
of
california's
courts
to
achieve
desegregation,
that
it
on
its
face
is
impermissibly
motivated,
or
that
the
evidence
so
clearly
shows
it
to
be
impermissibly
motivated
that
you
don't
need
a
further
hearing.
but
at
least
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
remand.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
say
it
not
so
much
in
the
face
of
that
fact,
but
because
of
that
fact.
what
is
so
unusual,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that,
as
this
court
has
emphasized
again
and
again,
typically
it
is
when
the
federal
courts
that
are
unavailable,
for
whatever
reason,
for
lack
of
standing
or
because
of
deference
to
the
state
courts,
what
is
important
is
that
when
federal
courts
are
unavailable
typically
one
can
vindicate
one's
rights,
state
as
well
as
federal,
in
state
court.
now,
when
does
proposition
one
limit
the
ability
of
a
state
court
fully
to
vindicate
one's
rights
under
state
law?
precisely
when
one
couldn't
get
vindication
from
a
federal
court.
in
other
words,
this
revolving
door
begins
to
operate
in
a
race
specific
way
exactly
when
you
need
the
state
courts
the
most.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
valley
forge
decision
you
did
emphasize
that
even
though
there
might
be
a
federal
right,
article
iii
imposes
independent
and
important
limits
on
the
federal
courts.
the
fact
that
you
can't
get
relief
from
a
federal
court
may
not
in
itself
mean
there's
no
substantive
violation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly
that's
right,
justice
rehnquist.
but,
number
one,
it
might
well
be
that
the
only
effective
relief
from
de
jure
segregation
is
an
inter-district
remedy
that
this
court
under
milliken,
partly
out
of
deference
to
the
state
courts,
would
not
be
willing
to
give.
and
yet
a
california
court
prior
to
proposition
one
would
have
had
no
reluctance
to
do
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
reason
perhaps
that
you
don't
have
any
federal
right
is
deference
to
states'
rights.
and
it
seems
to
me
perverse
to
make
that
deference
to
states'
rights
the
reason
for
states
to
close
their
doors.
but
what
about
de
facto
segregation?
california
has
chosen
in
the
area
of
education
to
say
what
this
court,
partly
out
of
institutional
and
federal-state
concern,
was
unwilling
to
say
in
rodriguez,
that
education
is
a
fundamental
right,
therefore
that
you
don't
need
to
show
deliberate
denial
of
equality
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
the
failure
to
show
that
would
prevent
one
from
getting
federal
relief
in
school
finance
cases
and
in
desegregation
cases.
but
it's
only
in
desegregation
cases
that
it
would
have
the
further
effect
of
now
requiring
that
in
order
to
get
relief
from
the
illegality
you
have
to
persuade
the
other
side,
the
school
board
that
is
in
default
of
its
duties
under
state
law,
that
it
must
do
something
for
you,
and
if
you
don't
persuade
them
that's
the
end
of
it.
it's
very
much
like
what
the
court
observed
was
unconstitutional
in
boddie
v.
connecticut.
that
is,
when
the
state
makes
it
impossible
for
you
to
vindicate
your
rights
without
full
resort
to
the
state
judicial
system,
but
then
cuts
off
that
resort
to
the
state
judicial
system,
it
is
violating
your
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
that
was
true
in
boddie
v.
connecticut
partly
because
a
fundamental
federal
right
was
involved.
the
analogue
in
this
case
of
that
fundamental
federal
right
is
that
the
limitation
on
access
to
courts
is
race
specific.
the
line
surely
is
drawn
between
desegregation
and
school
finance
even
if
it
turns
out
that
there's
no
line
drawn
between
desegregation
and
problems
of
handicapped.
but
we
submit
that
the
belated
suggestion
by
the
school
board,
for
the
first
time
in
this
entire
litigation,
that
perhaps
proposition
one
wasn't
directed
just
to
desegregation,
that
perhaps
it
was
directed
at
problems
of
handicapped
and
overcrowding
as
well,
is
utterly
and
facially
incredible.
never
in
the
history
of
this
litigation
until
the
filing
of
the
most
recent
round
of
briefs
in
this
court
has
it
been
suggested
by
the
school
board,
by
any
other
respondent,
that
proposition
one
has
nothing
to
do
with
race.
indeed,
if
that
were
true
there
would
have
been
a
very
simple
answer
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
give
to
the
hunter
v.
erickson
argument.
when
we
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
a
race
specific
obstacle
to
the
enforcement
of
rights,
in
violation
of
hunter
versus
erickson,
it
would
have
said
presumably,
no,
we
don't
construe
it
as
being
race
specific
at
all.
but
instead
the
court
below
said,
how
could
it
be
a
violation
of
your
federal
rights
when
it
explicitly
embraces
the
fourteenth
amendment?
that
was
the
only
answer
to
the
hunter
versus
erickson
argument
below.
we
submit
that
when
rights
of
racial
equality
are
reduced
in
a
state's
law
to
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
enforced
by
federal
courts
would
do,
while
analogous
rights
are
more
generously
treated,
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
good
enough
for
the
federal
courts
and
it
had
therefore
better
be
good
enough
for
minorities
as
well.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
can
take
it
away
as
long
as
it
does
not
do
so
on
a
race
specific
basis.
for
example,
if
the
state
of
california
had
taken
a
view
analogous
to
that
of
this
court
in
rodriguez
about
school
finance
and
had
just
said
in
the
one
limited
area
of
race
that
we
will
no
longer
worry
about
whether
something
is
de
jure
and
defacto,
we
will
give
a
broader
set
of
rights,
and
had
then
taken
that
back
either
by
judicial
decision
or
by
constitutional
change,
we
would
not
be
in
this
court
arguing
that
that
was
a
race
specific
change.
it
might
be
race
specific
in
the
trivial
sense
that
when
you
give
something
to
members
of
a
minority
race
and
then
take
it
back
that's
race
specific
by
definition.
but
this
court
has
not,
as
the
dayton
decisions
show,
equated
that
with
a
racial
classification.
that's
very
different
from
saying
across
the
board
in
the
educational
realm,
we
will
confer
broader
rights
and
now
we'll
take
them
back
from
minorities
alone.
this
law
clearly
at
least
does
that,
and
we
submit
it
does
more,
because
what
it
does
is
say,
you
all
have
all
of
these
rights,
they're
wonderful,
they're
like
a
teasing
illusion...
a
munificent
bequest
in
a
pauper's
will,
justice
jackson
once
called
it...
because
although
you
have
these
rights
the
only
way
you
can
vindicate
them
is
by
persuading
the
person
who's
in
default
of
its
obligation
with
respect
to
these
rights,
the
school
board,
that
it
should
voluntarily
confess
error
and
make
correction.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
education
is
a
broad
and
neutral
enough
category
that
it
would
not
be
race
specific.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
statistical
overlap,
as
between
veterans
and
males
in
feny,
and
we
would
then
have
to
prove
discriminatory
intent.
but
when
it
is
race
specific
in
the
sense
that
it
draws
a
line
between
integration...
that
word,
i
remind
the
court,
is
present
in
proposition
one
itself...
when
it
draws
a
line
between
integration
and
other
forms
of
equalization
within
education,
then
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
why
in
the
world
did
they
pick
education,
was
it
because
minorities
are
involved
there?
clearly,
the
focus
of
this
law
on
its
face
is
desegregation.
but
i
want
to
say,
before
reserving
some
time
for
rebuttal,
that
it's
important
to
put
this
case
in
its
right
context.
this
is
not
a
case,
it
seems
to
me,
about
desegregation
or
schooling
as
such.
it
is
a
case
about
the
fundamental
question
of
whether
a
state
may
structure
its
court
system
so
that
we
have
a
system
of
dual
courts,
courts
fully
capable
of
remedying,
with
the
full
panoply
of
necessary
remedies,
rights
that
relate
to
education,
unless
those
rights
involve
claims
of
racial
equality.
this
court
in
1963
in
the
case
of
johnson
against
virginia
held
that
racially
segregated
courtrooms
are
per
se
unconstitutional.
this
courthouse
itself
was
segregated
for
some
years
after
brown
v.
board
of
education.
bad
as
it
was
to
relegate
minorities
to
the
back
of
the
bus
under
the
jim
crow
laws
of
the
old
south,
we
submit
that
it
is
even
worse
to
relegate
minorities
to
the
back
of
the
courthouse
under
the
more
subtle
laws
of
the
new
north.
we
believe
that
this
law
does
just
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
begin
with,
i
suppose
i
should
note
that
no
argument
is
any
longer
being
made
by
the
board
in
this
case
that
there
is
some
compelling
justification
for
this
measure.
unlike
the
seattle
law,
for
example,
there's
no
suggestion
that
this
is
genuinely
a
neighborhood
policy.
students
can
be
forcibly
bused
out
of
their
neighborhoods
if
the
school
board
realizes
or
agrees
that
that's
what
it
ought
to
do.
so
what
we're
left
with
is
the
question
of
whether
either
on
its
face
or
under
arlington
heights
it
is
a
racial
classification.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
certainly
don't,
justice
white.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
says
if
it's
a
statistical
coincidence
that
that's
not
race
specific.
indeed,
in
hunter
what
section
137
added
was
race
and
religion
to
a
list
that
already
included
taxation.
it
can't
make
a
difference
whether
it's
in
one
law
or
two.
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
if
an
obstacle
is
put
in
the
way
of
racial
minorities
as
such,
even
if
a
couple
of
other
obstacles
are
thrown
in
for
good
measure,
that
does
not
invoke
james
v.
valtierra
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
a
word
about
arlington
heights.
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
opportunities
have
been
bypassed
to
try
to
show
racially
discriminatory
purpose.
proof
was
introduced,
but
its
admissibility
was
never
ruled
on
because
the
trial
court
thought
that
the
validity
of
proposition
one
was
immaterial.
and
there
was
a
remand
from
the
court
of
appeal,
but
expressly
limited
to
the
question
of
what
to
do
now
that
the
court
of
appeal
had
decided
proposition
one
was
constitutional.
no
evidence
was
allowed
on
remand
on
the
very
question
on
which
no
evidence
has
yet
been
heard
in
this
case,
namely
whether
proposition
one
was
motivated
by
desire
to
impose
greater
obstacles
to
racial
minorities.
so
i
do
think
that
at
a
very
minimum
the
failure
to
apply
arlington
heights
was
fatal
below.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
did.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
said
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
those
are
two
wholly
unrelated
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
number
one,
that
the
1970
findings
didn't
establish
any
purposeful
discrimination
by
the
board.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
then
as
to
proposition
one
it
said
that,
because
it
has
a
disclaimer
on
its
face
and
because
it
could
have
been
properly
motivated,
it
follows
that
there
need
be
no
inquiry
under
arlington
heights.
that
is
surely
a
misstatement
of
the
law.
but
we
don't
even
need
to
reach
arlington
heights,
because
i
think
it
is
very
clear,
as
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
that
even
if
something
hits
explicitly
race
plus
something
else
the
explicit
attention
to
race
imposing
an
obstacle
to
racial
minorities
independently
triggers
the
strictest
scrutiny,
which
can't
be
satisfied
here
because
there's
no
compelling
justification.
more
than
that,
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
that
we
have
here
one
of
these
very
difficult
cases
where
the
law
on
its
face
is
simply
incompatible
perhaps
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
then
you
try
to
figure
out
what
to
do,
is
untenable.
the
law
on
its
face,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
clearly
suggests
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
california
constitution
when
it
comes
to
pupil
assignment
had
added
nothing
outside
the
area
of
race,
clearly
suggests
that
it's
only
race
that's
being
spoken
of.
but
if
there
were
ambiguity
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
settled
it.
on
page
59a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it
is
specifically
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
proposition
one
merely...
and
they
use
the
word
"merely"...
removes
court-ordered
school
assignment
to
cure
state-prescribed
racial
imbalance.
the
court
says
on
page
67a,
all
the
amendment
does...
despite
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
they
never
said
"all",
they
never
said
"only"...
all
the
amendment
does
is
remove
from
courts
this
remedy
to
end
racial
isolation.
nothing
could
be
clearer
than
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
state
courts
on
this.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
was...
justice
rehnquist,
it
was
suggested
by
counsel
for
the
board
that
it
wasn't
put
to
them
that
it
was
race
specific.
on
the
contrary,
it
was.
that
was
half
the
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
of
course
not,
because
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
it
did.
mr.

no.
but
what
we
argued
in
the
case
below,
what
was
argued
in
the
case
below,
was
that
the
only
thing
it
covers
is
race.
and
the
court
addresses
that
issue.
it's
not
a
new
argument.
it
addresses
it
and,
instead
of
denying
it,
it
says,
no,
it
embraces
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
not
enough
under
the
constitution
when
it
puts
an
obstacle
specifically
in
the
way
of
vindicating
racial
rights,
it
creates
a
forbidden
system
of
courts
that
inadequately
protect
minorities.
thank
you.
