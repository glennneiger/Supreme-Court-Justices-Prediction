unknown
speaker
that
was
written
in
terms
of
limited
as
between
the
california
standards
or
the
federal
standards?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
corollary
to
that
that
states
must
have
the
same
standards
as
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
ratchet
that
only
goes
one
way?
unknown
speaker
is
it
analogous
to
a
state
norris-laguardia
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
the
proposition
doesn't
forbid
a
school
board
from
voluntarily
desegregating?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
different
from
the
washington.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
school
board
hasn't
any
duty
to
desegregate,
you
agree
with
that
i
gather,
if
there
isn't
de
jure.
unknown
speaker
except
for
the
proposition.
unknown
speaker
the
proposition
removes
the
duty
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
was--
unknown
speaker
--where
is
it
in
the
petition
for
certiori--
unknown
speaker
--i
agree,
it--
unknown
speaker
--i
agree
with
you,
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
what
you
would
say,
mr.
tribe,
if
the
proposition
had
said
that
it
just
removes
all
the
duty
that
was
found
in
crawford
to
desegregate,
even
if
it
was
de
facto?
unknown
speaker
it
is
really
a
lot
different...
that
is
a
lot
different
than
what
they
did.
they
say,
you
may
have
a
duty
but
it
is
just
completely
unenforceable
in
the
court.
unknown
speaker
the
way
it
reads,
you
think
now,
if
the
crawford
and
the
crawford
rule
still
stands,
there
is
nothing
that
a
school
board
can
do
but
to
desegregate?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
to
say
that
they
are
voluntarily
doing
it
is
beside
the
point.
they
have
a
duty
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
matter,
isn't
it
sensible
to
say
that
a
right
without
a
remedy
really
isn't
a
right,
and
that
the
conclusion
justice
white
suggests
is
true,
that
the
right
is
gone
for
all
practical
purposes?
unknown
speaker
then
it
really
is
a
ratchet
because
the
state
can
give
more
and
more
consideration
to
desegregation
policies
going
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
constitution,
but
it
can
never
go
back.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
crawford
gave
on
a
broader
basis?
what
it
gave
was
a
right
to
minorities,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
jackson
was
before
serrano?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
isn't
it
at
least
possible
that
the
proposition
one
could
affect
other
types
of
plaintiffs
who
would
seek
busing
to
remedy
a
problem?
for
instance,
if
california
recognized
some
right
of
the
handicapped
to
have
an
equal
educational
opportunity,
and
there
were
only
one
school
that
provided
that
kind
of
benefit,
and
plaintiffs
might
seek
busing
to
afford
that
remedy,
would
this
proposition
affect
that
possibly?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
i
gather
the
judgment
of
the
court
whose
judgment
we
are
reviewing
said
that
they
set
aside
the
findings
of
discriminatory
intent?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
there
was
no
discriminatory
intent.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
must
convince
us
that
such
findings
are
not
necessary
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
even...
you
wouldn't
even
say
that
that
is
equivalent
to
discriminatory
intent?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
racial
classification
that
you
have
here?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
initiative?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
particular
charter
amendment
did,
though.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
in
face
of
the
fact
that
compliance
with
federal
standards
and
federal
courts'
orders
was
implicit
in
the
california
no.
1.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reason
you
can't
get
relief
in
the
federal
court,
by
your
hypothesis,
is
because
no
federal
right
is
violated.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
people
who
claimed
they
were
the
victims
of
de
jure
segregation
have
had
no
difficulty
getting
relief
from
the
federal
courts
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
that's
an
example
of
a
case
where
you
don't
have
any
federal
right.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
add
up
to
the
proposition
that
once
the
state
has
given
some
right
it
can't
take
it
away?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
california
had
construed
its
constitution
more
liberally
in
a
number
of
respects,
say
the
rights
of
criminal
defendants,
property
rights
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
then
decided
that
it
would
retreat
in
the
area
of
education,
which
did
involve
the
crawford
type
right,
but
also
involved
the
serrano
type
right?
unknown
speaker
even
though
that
was
the
only
one
where
minorities
were
involved?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shea,
in
your
view
if
congress
should
take
away
federal
jurisdiction
to
use
busing
as
a
remedy
would
the
california
courts
be
deprived
of
the
power
to
do
the
same
thing,
even
when
there's
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
proposition
one,
the
measure
of
the
power
that's
left
to
the
california
courts
is
it's
equal
to
what
a
federal
court
could
order.
unknown
speaker
so
any
cutting
back
on
the
federal
court
power
it
seems
to
me
would
automatically
also
affect
the
power
of
your
courts,
even
if
there
were
a
federal
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
but
you
question
whether--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
saying
that
the
courts
can
do
more,
that
the
state
courts
can
do
more,
or
that
the
state
school
boards
can
do
more?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
a
state
court
do
anything
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
of
de
jure
segregation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
when
you
qualify
it
that
way
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
almost
entirely
left
up
to
the
school
boards,
because
of
the
language
in
proposition
one
that
in
enforcing
this
subdivision
or
any
other
provision
of
this
constitution,
no
court
of
this
state
may
impose
upon
the
state
of
california
or
any
public
entity,
board
or
official
any
obligation
or
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
use
of
pupil
school
assignment
or
pupil
transportation.
now,
what
can
a
court
do
in
the
light
of
that
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
that
be
concerning
pupil
assignment?
unknown
speaker
the
court
would
order
a
school
established,
but
it--
unknown
speaker
general
lee,
are
we
bound
by
any
characterization
of
the
proposition
in
the
court
appeals,
for
example,
on
page
50a
of
its
characterization?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
do
you
have
the
petition
for
cert
there
with
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
i'm
looking
for
page
55a.
unknown
speaker
54a,
at
the
bottom
it
says:
"the
board
remains"...
this
is
after
the
passage
of
the
amendment.
unknown
speaker
"the
board
remains
subject
to
its
constitutional
duty
under
state
law
to
undertake
reasonable
feasible
steps
to
alleviate
school
segregation,
regardless
of
cause.
"
unknown
speaker
then
it
says:
"in
carrying
out
its
duty,
the
board
may
utilize
any
and
all
desegregation
techniques,
including
pupil
assignment
and
pupil
transportation.
"
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
amendment
forbid?
unknown
speaker
i'm
going
down
to
the
next
paragraph.
unknown
speaker
"in
the
absence
of
a
board
plan
that
provides
meaningful
progress,
the
trial
court
is
authorized
to
implement
a
desegregation
plan
that
may
utilize
all
available
desegregation
techniques,
except
that
of
pupil
school
assignment
and
pupil
transportation.
"
now,
what
techniques
are
those?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
any
respect
in
which
the
california
constitution
gave
broader
protection
to
any
group
that's
relevant
here
other
than
racial
minorities?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
necessarily
does
the
amendment
have
any
affect
on
court
matters
except
those
involving
pupil
transportation
to
correct
racial
imbalance?
unknown
speaker
but
this
refers
only
to
constitutional
obligations.
the
proposition
one
relates
only
to
the
california
constitution
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
one
can
think
of
hypotheticals,
and
i'm
not
sure
yours
really
fits.
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
only
real
life
problems
that
the
amendment
addresses
concern
busing
for
racial
purposes?
unknown
speaker
at
least
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
identifies
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
it
would
be
invalid
if
it
were
race
specific
in
the
sense
they
argue?
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
to
your
second
point--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
pick
up
where
your
response
to,
i
think,
to
justice
white
left
off.
the
next
sentence
is:
"thus,
the
effect
of
the
constitutional
amendment
is
to
withdraw
one
desegregation
technique
from
the
state
courts'
arsenal
of
remedies
available
to
alleviate
unintended
non-purposeful
segregation,
but
to
leave
all
other
available
techniques
intact.
"
unknown
speaker
that
sums
up,
or
at
least
the
court
was
attempting
to
sum
up,
the
consequence
of
its
holding,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
matter
that
the
chief
justice
read
to
you
requires
you
to
reach
your
second
point?
unknown
speaker
that
means
you
really
haven't
answered
the
chief
justice
yet.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
we
accept
this
as
the...
as
the...
as
the
only
real
life
reason
for
adopting
this
amendment?
that's
what
the
court
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
wasn't?
what
if
you
said
it
was
half
of
it.
would
you
be
any
better
off?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
wasn't
the
sole
reason.
what
if
it
was
one
of
two
reasons?
you
have
two
equal
reasons.
then
you're
still
in
trouble,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
why?
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
even
if
it's
half
and
half?
unknown
speaker
or
a
quarter,
or
ten
percent,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
sort
of
an
amount
healthy
test.
unknown
speaker
you
did
say
"all",
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
know
a
few
out
there
that
don't
agree.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
do
you
agree
or
do
you
not
that
valtierra
said
that
even
if
half
the
purpose
is
racial
that
the
law
is
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
it
just
said
it
might
have
some
impact
on--
unknown
speaker
--but
surely
the
court
of
appeals
disaffirmed
the
trial
court's
previous
findings
of
purposeful
racial
discrimination.
did
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
suggesting
nevertheless
it
turned
right
around
and
said
proposition
one
nevertheless
indicates
a
racial
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
with
that.
but
i'm
asking
what
you're
submitting.
unknown
speaker
by
the
board,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
really
an
authoritative
interpretation
on
the
point
you're
making,
though,
is
it?
it
wasn't
put
to
them
then
that
this
applies
to
handicapped,
pupil
assignment
for
handicap
purposes,
and
they
say,
no,
it
doesn't
apply
for
handicaps,
it's
just
for
racial
imbalance.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
this...
was
the
proposition
that
proposition
one
had
an
effect
on
assignment
for
handicap
purposes
put
to
them
in
oral
argument?
unknown
speaker
did
you
argue
orally?
