mr.
g.
william
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
throughout
the
course
of
this
lengthy
litigation,
the
petitioners
have
always
asserted
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
in
the
federal
system,
as
well
as
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
should
be
controlling.
proposition
one
accepts
that
argument
by
making
all
of
those
the
governing
standard
in
california.
i
submit
that
the
key
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
proposition
one
is
the
very
adoption
of
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
clause
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
all
the
provisions
of
one...
and
i'll
take
them
up
in
a
minute...
yield
to
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
constitution,
and
proposition
one
has
no
racial
classification
in
it.
now,
let
me
first
of
all
turn,
because
of
the
remarks
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners...
i
want
to
explain.
he
said
specifically
that
the
court
below
did
not
address
itself
to
the
issue
of
whether
it
was
race
specific.
i
can
understand
that
a
new
argument
is
being
made
here,
and
it
is
a
new
argument,
and
that
is,
that's
the
only
reason
i
bring
it
up,
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
itself
when
the
case
was
argued
below
to
any
charge
of
being
race
specific.
there
were
two
issues
argued
below.
one
was
that
the
findings
of
the
court,
the
trial
court
in
1970,
which
contrary
to
the
statement
that
has
just
been
made
were
incorporated
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
decision
which
led
to
the
court
of
appeal
decision.
the
1980
decision
on
proposition
one,
incorporated
those
same
1970
findings.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
from
pages
11
to
49
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that's
an
entire
discussion
of
those
findings,
with
the
conclusion
being
set
forth
that
those
findings
did
not
constitute
a
de
jure
violation
by
this
school
board
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
so
that
was
the
point
that
was
first
made
below.
the
balance
of
that
opinion,
commencing
on
page
50,
solely
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
proposition
one.
so
the
argument
of
racial
classification
is
new
and
being
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
proposition
one...
and
i'm
referring
particularly
to
the
response
that
counsel
for
petitioners
made
to--
justice
o'connor's
question...
it
is
the
position
of
the
school
district
that
proposition
one
in
its
language
does
not
limit,
does
not
limit
its
reach
either
in
the
constitutional
restraints
on
the
state
and
the
invoking
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
in
the
provision
restraining
the
state
courts
unless
there's
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
and
a
decision
which
would
support
the
remedy
involved.
it
is
not
limited
to
school
desegregation
cases.
nowhere...
and
i'm
looking
at
the
first
page
of
the
proposition
as
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
this
court...
nowhere
is
there
any
limitation
that,
for
example,
would
not
involve
overcrowding
of
schools
or
handicapped
children,
in
the
illustration
given.
and
then
petitioners'
counsel
finds
what
in
proposition
one
to
establish
it's
race
specific?
he
turns
to
the
proviso
clause,
which
says
that
nothing
in
it,
nothing
in
one,
shall
prevent
a
school
board
from
using,
any
california
school
board,
from
using
mandatory
busing
or
reassignment
of
students
in
a
school
segregation
problem.
so
he
takes
that
and
lifts
it
to
the
whole
proposition
one
and
says,
there
is
your
race
specific.
or
he
goes
another
way
and
he
says,
look
at
the
court
section,
the
restraint
on
the
court
section.
only
to
remedy...
a
court
in
california
can
only
use
mandatory
assignment
of
students
or
transportation
of
those
students
to
remedy
a
specific
violation
of
what?
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
impose
a
remedy
which
would
be
permitted
under
a
federal
court
interpreting
that
violation
and
applying
a
remedy.
from
that
he
urges
this
court
to
say
that
this
is
a
racial
classification
because
it
sets
up
a
two-tier,
a
second
class
court
system
in
california.
if
california
in
proposition
one
does
so,
i
submit,
only
gives
the
courts
in
that
one
instance
the
same
powers
that
you
give
the
lower
federal
courts,
that
is
hardly
creating
a
second
class
judicial
system,
because
that
has
been
created
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
g.
william
shea
justice
stevens,
i
would
have
to
look
at
that
bill,
but
i
would
have
grave
doubts
as
to
the
constitutionality
if
congress
tried
to
take
away
a
decision...
the
right
of
the
federal
courts
to
redress
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation,
if
that
was
needed
under
the
circumstances,
as
was
said
in
the
swann
case,
needed
in
order
to
bring
about
the
desegregation.
mr.
g.
william
shea
i
so
agree.
mr.
g.
william
shea
well,
i
would
say
yes,
because
the
parity
would
be
there.
i
can't
deny
that.
mr.
g.
william
shea
but
i
question
the
propriety
under
the
constitution
and
the
separation
of
powers.
i
wouldn't
want
to
get
into
that
big
problem,
but
i
would
question
whether
that
could
be
properly
done.
so
in
evaluating
whether
we
have
got
an
inferior
court
system,
i
just
don't
think
that's
a
real
possibility.
but
i
would
go
one
step
further
in
my
position
on
the
state
courts
as
to
where
they
stand
now
under
the
proposition
one.
they
are
still
in
a
position
to
do
more
than
the
federal
courts
can,
because
the
other
tools
that
this
court
well
knows
that
are
used
in
desegregating
schools,
in
relieving
racial
imbalance...
magnet
schools,
voluntary
transfers,
changes
in
teacher-pupil
ratios,
enriched
curricula...
those
are
still
obligations.
they
are
still
obligations
and,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
at
the
present
time
in
los
angeles
we
have
plan
four
working
which
was
put
into
effect
in
the
fall
of
last
year,
after
the
decision
below
had
been
made
and
the
california
supreme
court
on
march
11,
1981,
the
same
court,
made
up
of
almost
the
same
personnel
that
decided
crawford
one,
declined
to
review
those
two
key
points
in
the
decision
below,
that
there
was
no
de
jure
violation
and
that
proposition
one
was
constitutional.
mr.
g.
william
shea
well,
the
state
school
board
can
do
even
more,
because
they
can
use
the
transportation
assignment
under
the
proviso
clause.
mr.
g.
william
shea
i
think
they
can,
because
contrary...
and
i
would
agree
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
think
the
question
was
asked
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
that's
where
we
stand
now
below...
it
did
not
say
that
crawford
one,
the
decision
which
first
carved
out
the
state
right
for
de
facto
relief
of
racially
imbalanced
schools.
in
the
decision
below
at
page
54
in
the
same
reporting
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
they
did
say
that
that
obligation
remained.
justice
rehnquist,
if
that
obligation
remained
then
the
courts
could
order
the
establishment,
if
they
did
need
to,
establishment
of
a
magnet
school,
or
they
could
order
other
things,
as
long
as
it
did
not
involve
the
reassignment
or
transportation
on
a
mandatory
basis
of
the
pupils.
mr.
g.
william
shea
well,
i
assume,
for
example,
if
they
did
not...
we
have
established
magnet
schools.
but
assume
that
a
school
board
did
not
establish
them
and
a
parent
or
somebody
wanted
a
magnet
school,
and
so
they
asked
the
school
board
to
do
it
and
they
did
not
do
so.
and
that
being
recognized
as
a
tool,
they
could
sue
and
ask
the
court
to
enforce
the--
mr.
g.
william
shea
--no,
because
magnets
are
all
voluntary.
the
school
could
be
established,
but
the
attendance
would
not
have
to
be
compelled.
mr.
g.
william
shea
it
could
do
so.
i'm
not
saying
so,
because
i
would
hope
that
other
school
districts
would
emulate
us,
where
we
have
established
magnet
schools
and
where
we
now
have
an
ongoing
program.
but
all
i
meant
to
bring
out
is
that
there
is
implicit
in
proposition
one
a
broader
power
in
the
state
courts
in
that
sense
than
even
a
federal
court
would
have.
but
the
attendance
would
be
simply
voluntary.
the
racial
classification
argument,
which
i
think
as
i
heard
counsel
is
relying
primarily
under
the
hunter
against
erickson
situation,
i
think
is
readily
distinguishable
because
there
was
clearly
there,
just
as
we
go
back
in
the
older
case
of
yik
wo
or
in
gomillion
against
lightfoot...
it
was
too
clear
that
there,
when
you
were
interfering
and
putting
a
special
premium
on
the
getting
a
charter
amendment
in
akron
that
required
to
go
out
and
get
a
majority
vote,
when
up
to
that
time
the
minorities
involved
were
only
obliged
to
get
what
any
other
ordinance
would
be,
the
councilmanic
reading,
instead
of
going
to
the
electorate...
that
you've
a
clear
case
for
violating
a
race
and
making
a
racial
classification.
but
you
cannot
take
that
and
lift
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
this
court
in
almost
a
comparable
problem
in
james
against
valtierra
later
declined,
where
the
obvious
impact
or
character
was
lessened
by
the
fact
that
you
only
had
low
cost
housing
involved
in
that
case,
and
you
refused
then
to
follow
and
extend
the
hunter
doctrine.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
discussing
what
i
interpreted
was
their
second
effort
to
persuade
you
to
reverse
the
court
below,
and
that
is
that
this
proposition
had
a
discriminatory
purpose.
now,
in
support
of
that
argument...
they
even
seem
to
concede
that
it
doesn't
say
so
on
its
face.
and
they
can't
point
to...
they
point
to
no
evidence
below
of
that
purpose
to
establish
that.
what
they
really
point
to
is
a
collection,
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
newspapers,
campaign
literature,
and
historical
treatises.
i
have
made
the
point
in
our
brief
that
none
of
that
was
admitted
below.
it
wasn't
considered.
now,
there
is
a
suggestion
in
this
latest
reply
brief
on
the
part
of
petitioners
that
the
least
you
should
do
with
this
case,
the
very
least,
is
send
it
back
and
give
them
a
chance
to
prove
that
intent,
that
discriminatory
purpose.
and
they
say
there
was
no
remand,
therefore
you
should
remand.
i
submit
if
you
look
at
the
very
last
words
of
the
opinion
below,
as
it
appears
at
the
end
on
page
70a
of
the
same
appendix,
and
i
quote:
"the
orders
of
may
19,
1980.
"
--and
that
is
the
one
below
on
proposition
one...
7,
1980>
["]...
and
that
is
the
one
that
was
made
moot
by
the
ruling
on
the
proposition
one...
is
"remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
"
but
not
only
was
the
court
below
remanding,
but
a
remand
was
held
and
there
was
another
trial.
there
was
a
trial
in
the
summer
of
1981,
where
the
petitioners
in
face
of
that
remand
with
notice
had
every
opportunity
to
offer
evidence
of
this
discriminatory
purpose.
and
they
offered
none,
no
evidence.
and
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
this
was
in
effect
the
fifth
trial,
and
if
they
had
this
purpose
in
mind,
this
discriminatory
purpose,
when
proposition
one...
and
the
chronology
is
that
the
long
trial
involving
plan
three
started
in
october
of
1979
and
continued
to
april
of
1980.
but
by
15
days
after
trial
started,
proposition
one
had
been
passed
by
the
people.
and
we
asked
the
court
then
now
to
apply
proposition
one.
that
trial
lasted
for
six
months
and
if
there
was
any
thought
by
then
that
this
had
a
discriminatory
purpose,
that
was
their
first
opportunity
to
prove
it.
and
they
had
a
second
opportunity
in
the
second
trial
after
the
remand
by
the
court
below.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
with
all
due
respect,
that
what
petitioners
are
asking
you
to
do
here
is
to
in
effect
overrule
your
decisions
where
you
have
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
school
cases
a
deliberate
discriminatory
intentional
purpose,
and
establish
that
rule
in
california.
and
i
urge
you
that
in
this
case
proposition
one
should
be
upheld
because
it
does
match
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
i
respectfully
close
by
urging
you
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
