mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners'
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
proposition
one
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it's
narrow
because
it
has
to
be,
and
it
turns
on
whether
proposition
one
really
means
what
it
says.
the
argument
is
that
under
hunter
v.
erickson
there
is
a
constitutional
inequality
in
access
to
the
courts.
because
of
this
court's
holding
in
james
v.
valtierra,
which
was
very
closely
observed,
that
argument
is
foreclosed
unless
the
petitioners
can
persuade
this
court
that,
contrary
to
the
clear
language
of
proposition
one
itself,
it
prohibits
court-ordered
busing
only
for
integration
purposes
and
not
for
any
other
purposes
as
well.
petitioners'
contention
that
this
case
is
governed
by
hunter
v.
erickson
is
insufficient
for
two
reasons:
first,
this
is
not
a
hunter
v.
erickson
case,
for
the
same
reason
that
james
v.
valtierra
was
not
a
hunter
v.
erickson
case.
in
valtierra
this
court
upheld
a
california
voter
amendment
to
the
state
constitution
which
provided
that
no
federally
funded
low
rent
housing
project
could
be
developed
by
a
state
body
without
approval
by
a
majority
of
those
voting
in
a
community
election.
the
parallel
to
hunter
v.
erickson
was
remarkable.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
that
it
could
hold
that
california
voter
amendment
unconstitutional
only
by
extending
hunter
v.
erickson,
which,
in
the
language
of
this
court,
"we
decline
to
do".
and
the
reason
was
that,
and
i'm
quoting
again,
"the
article
requires
referendum
approval
for
any
low
rent
public
housing
project,
not
only
for
projects
which
will
be
occupied
by
a
racial
minority.
"
in
order
to
get
over
the
valtierra
hurdle,
therefore,
the
petitioners
have
to
show
that
court-ordered
busing
applies
only
to
busing
for
racial
balance
purposes.
this
they
cannot
do
and
this
they
have
not
done.
the
reason
is
that
the
relevant
language
simply
will
not
yield
to
their
rewriting
efforts.
it
prohibits,
in
relevant
terms,
judicial
imposition...
and
i
am
quoting...
"of
any
obligation
with
respect
to.
"
"pupil
school
assignment
or
pupil
transportation.
"
what
the
petitioners
would
like
it
to
prohibit
is
any
obligation
with
respect
to
pupil
transportation
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
racial
balance.
but
that
is
not
what
it
says.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
counsel's
characterization
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion
below
were
correct,
then
you
would
have
the
difficult
problem
of
the
language
saying
a
and
the
court
of
appeals
saying
not
a,
and
i've
always
wondered
what
this
court
would
do
under
those
circumstances.
in
fact,
you
don't
have
that
case.
i'm
sure
that
this
was
just
a
slip
in
the
exuberance
of
the
moment.
but
there
is
nowhere,
absolutely
nowhere
in
that
court
of
appeals
opinion,
that
says
that
the
only
purpose
for
which
court-ordered
busing
is
prohibited
is
for
racial
balance
purposes.
now,
it
is
true
that
on
five
or
six
different
occasions
the
court
of
appeals
does
refer
to
the
fact
that
this
prohibits
the
use
of
court-ordered
busing
for
desegregation
purposes.
but
nowhere
does
that
court
opinion
say
or
does
any
other
authoritative
interpretation
by
the
california
authorities
say
that
it's
only
for
those
purposes.
the
only
authoritative
ruling
that
you
have
on
that
subject
comes
from
the
california
attorney
general,
and
his
view
is,
as
it
must
be,
that
the
amendment
means
what
it
says.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
i
can
give
you--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
amendment
forbade
the
use
of
either
the
court's
ordering
pupil
transportation
or
the
school
board's
utilizing
busing
as
one
of
their
means
for...
excuse
me.
well,
it
forbade
the
use
of
court-ordered
busing.
it
did
not
forbid
the
school
board
itself
from--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
they're
the
ones
that
mr.
shea
referred
to,
techniques
such
as
magnet
schools
or
the
assignment
of
higher
quality
teachers
and
staff
to
particular
minority
schools,
techniques
such
as
spending
more
money
in
minority
schools.
this
they
not
only
have
the
opportunity
to
do;
this
they
have
the
obligation
to
do,
because
california
still
has
requirements
over
and
above
those
that
the
federal
constitution
has.
it's
just
that
what
california
has
done
is
to
cut
back
to
one
extent
one
remedy
or
one
duty,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that.
and
i
don't
think
you
get
much
sustenance
out
whether
it's
one
or
the
other.
it
has
cut
back
to
one
extent
the
interpretation
of
its
constitution
that
california
previously
experimented
with.
and
that
brings
me--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--not
that
i
know
of,
not
that
i
know
of,
because--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--indeed
it
does.
if
you
read
it
carefully,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
see
any
way
that
you...
for
example,
i
am
informed
that
there
may
be
a
statutory
obligation--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--all
right,
all
right.
but
assume
that
there
were...
that
someone
came
into...
assume
that
someone
came
into
court
and
asserted
that
there
were
a
constitutional
obligation,
for
example,
say
they
had
a
budget-balancing
amendment
or
whatever.
this
would
prevent
the
courts
from
ever
enforcing
any
court-ordered
busing
remedy
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
any
constitutional
amendment
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not,
because
i'm
not
that
acquainted
with
the
california
experience.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
i
am
aware
of.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this,
that
california
has
structured
this
about
as
carefully
as
it
can
be
structured.
it
is
not
race
specific.
i
agree
certainly
with
counsel
for
the
petitioners
that
in
order
to
get
over
the
valtierra
hurdle
they
have
to
persuade
this
court
that
it
really
does
on
its
face
exclude
any
other
kinds
of
busing,
and
that
they
simply
have
not
done
and
cannot
do.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
and
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
i
agree
that
they
lose
unless
it
is
race
specific.
i
do
not
agree
that
we
lose
if
it
is.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
the
california
courts
have
held
that
the
constitution
of
that
state
imposes
an
obligation
to
alleviate
de
facto
segregation
and
it
still
does
even
after
proposition
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
not
at
all.
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
a
nice
introduction
into
my
second
point,
which
i've
been
trying
to
get
to.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
at
all.
i
have
answered
the
chief
justice,
but
i
will
now
answer
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
does
not
say,
justice
white,
that
it
was
the
only
one.
as
mr.
shea
has
pointed
out,
the
james
v.
valtierra
argument--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me.
i
missed
the
question.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
think
we're
not
in
trouble
at
all.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
what
this
court
held
in
james
v.
valtierra,
that
hunter
v.
erickson
does
not
apply
in
those
circumstances
where
there
are
other
reasons
other
than
racial
reasons
for
what
the
court...
what
the
state
has
done.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
even
if
it's...
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
half
and
half
or
whatever
it
was.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
so
long
as
it
is
not
race
specific
and
race
specific
only.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
if
california
loses
this
case,
then
the
real
losers
are
going
to
be
not
only
the
constitutional
allocation
of
authority
in
our
federal
system
between
national
and
state
governments,
but
even
more
specifically
the
effort
by
states
and
individuals
all
across
the
country
to
achieve
racially
integrated
schools.
if
california
had
originally
chosen
to
limit
its
efforts
to
deal
with
racial
imbalance
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
its
decision
would
clearly
have
raised
no
constitutional
issue,
and
the
petitioners
do
not
contend
otherwise.
in
fact,
california
went
further.
it
took
upon
itself
the
obligation
to
deal
just
with
the
problems
of
de
jure
segregation,
but
de
facto
as
well.
and
now,
almost
20
years
later,
all
ethnic
groups
in
all
parts
of
the
state
agree
that
one
aspect
of
that
experiment
has
not
worked,
at
least
for
california.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
sense,
justice
marshall,
that
this
amendment--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
is
no
disadvantage
to
anyone
from
permitting
states
to
try
something
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
demands
and
then
back
off
if
it
doesn't
work.
the
successes
from
that
kind
of
experimentation
redound
to
everyone's
benefit.
the
failures
harm
only
the
particular
state
that
undertook
the
experiment.
it
would
be
a
great
disservice
not
only
to
federalism
generally
but
specifically
to
the
cause
of
relieving
racial
segregation
if
states
such
as
california
were
not
permitted
to
try
the
waters
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment
barrier
reef,
with
the
assurance
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
will
permit
them
to
come
back
to
a
safer
harbor
if
the
experiment
does
not
work.
now,
my
opponent
says
that
that's
true,
but
you
can't
do
it
where
it's
race
specific.
that
is
only
saying
that
you
can't
ever
back
off
from
efforts
at
racial
imbalance,
because
by
definition
you
have
to
use
racial
imbalance
efforts;
they
have
to
be
saying
that
racial
balance
efforts
are
race
specific.
and
as
a
consequence
the
interests
of
school
desegregation,
whether
de
jure
or
defacto,
would
scarcely
be
served
if
the
one
state,
the
one
state
whose
legal
requirements
go
the
farthest
in
dealing
with
segregation
and
clearly
go
beyond
the
demands
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
were
to
be
the
only
state
whose
efforts
to
deal
with
de
facto
segregation
were
held
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
brandeis
in
his
classic
statement
on
the
values
of
experimentation
pointed
out
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
prevent
an
experiment,
and
that
it
is
one
of
the
happy
incidents
of
the
federal
system
that
a
single
courageous
state
may,
if
its
citizens
choose,
serve
as
a
laboratory.
in
this
case,
we
submit
the
court
should
not
stop
experimentation.
if
it
does,
every
state
will
know
that
its
reward
for
experimenting
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
federal
constitution
will
be
a
hunter
v.
erickson
requirement
that
experiments
which
fail
must
nevertheless
be
continued.
it
is
not
a
sufficient
answer
to
that
argument
to
say
that
it
is
race
specific
in
that
instance,
because
all
that
is
really
saying
is
once
again
that
it
really
is
a
ratchet
wrench,
that
you
can't
really
back
off
once
you've
tried
something
and
it
doesn't
work.
because
by
definition
any
effort
at
racial
imbalance
must
fit
the
petitioners'
definition
of
what
is
a
race
specific
classification,
because
there
is
nothing
in
this
particular
case
to
differentiate
it
from
any
other.
for
this
reason,
we
join
with
the
appellees
in
urging
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
be
affirmed.
