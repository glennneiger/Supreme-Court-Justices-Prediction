mr.
thomas
s.
white
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
question
of
statutory
construction
of
the
third
paragraph
of
section
2314.
that
statute
provides
in
its
pertinent
part
"whoever
with
unlawful
or
fraudulent
intent
transports
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
any
falsely
made,
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited
securities,
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
falsely
made,
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited,
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
ten
years
or
both.
"
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
here
that
in
order
for
the
united
states
to
sustain
a
valid
conviction
under
this
section
of
the
statute,
and
under
this
particular
paragraph,
it
is
necessary
that
they
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
check
or
checks
that
were
here
involved
in
this
case
be
in
a
forged
or
altered
condition
prior
to
their
interstate
transportation.
if
i
may
briefly
state
the
facts,
the
petitioner
here
was
indicted
on
a
three-count
indict,
one
count
charging
him
with
violation
of
the
dyer
act,
the
other
two
counts
charging
him
with
violation
of
this
subsection
of
2314.
the
facts
as
developed
at
the
trial
were
as
follows.
early
in
1977,
a
robbery
occurred
at
the
union
office
in
youngstown,
ohio.
some
blank
checks
were
taken.
the
union
notified
the
bank
on
which
the
checks
were
drawn,
and
the
account
was
closed.
approximately
17
months
later,
the
petitioner
visited
an
automobile
agency
in
pittsburgh,
don
allen's
chevrolet,
and
negotiated
the
price
of
a
used
corvette.
after
arriving
at
the
price,
he
told
the
man,
the
salesman
that
he
would
be
back
the
next
day,
that
he
lived
in
ohio,
that
he
had
to
get
a
check
from
his
credit
union.
he
also
told
him
that
he
worked
in
the
pittsburgh
area
for
a
railroad.
the
next
day
he
appeared
with
one
of
the
checks
that
had
been
stolen
at
the
union
office
in
youngstown,
and
it
was...
when
he
presented
it,
it
was
altered
and
forged.
the
dealership
took
possession
of
the
check,
and
he
took
possession
of
the
car.
the
car
was
never
found
again.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor.
that
occurred,
of
course,
in
pittsburgh.
the
second--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--well,
that
is
the
question,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
works
here,
that
when
a
check
is
presented
that
is
a
forgery,
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
it
was
forged
where
it
first
appeared.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
your
honor,
that
is
a
presumption
that
goes
back
to
1822,
justice
storey,
and
it
has
been
utilized
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
one
of
the
courts
that
utilized
it
was
one
of
the
courts
of
which...
which
would
cause
the
split
here
among
the
circuits,
owens
versus
the
united
states.
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor,
he
was,
and
it
was
used
in
that
case
to
establish
venue.
the
second
incident
occurred
at
rini
boat
sales
in
beaver
falls,
pennsylvania.
again
the
petitioner
appeared,
negotiated
the
price
of
a
boat
with
a
trailer
to
haul
it
away,
and
after
having
agreed
on
the
price,
he
told
them
that
he
lived
in
ohio,
and
that
he
had
to
get
a
check
from
his
credit
union.
about
a
week
later
he
telephoned
them,
told
them
that
he
had
the
funds,
and
that
he
would
be
there
some
time
during
that
day,
but
he
had
to
work
overtime.
about
a
few
hours
later
he
called
and
told
them
he
was
on
the
ohio
turnpike,
at
a
rest
stop,
and
he
would
be
there
shortly.
approximately
20
minutes
later,
an
employee
of
rini
boat
sales
was
standing
in
front
of
the
agency,
when
he
saw
the
petitioner
pull
out
of
a
dead
end
street
in
a
pickup
truck.
what
followed
then
was
just
what
happened
at
the
chevrolet
agency.
the
dealer
took
possession
of
a
check
that
was
in
a
forged
and
altered
condition.
it
was
one
of
the
checks
that
had
been
stolen
at
the
union
office
in
youngstown
17
months
previously.
and
thereafter,
the
boat
and
the
trailer
were
taken
by
the
petitioner.
the
boat
was
found
about
a
year
later
in
pennsylvania.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence,
the
defendant
moved
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
dyer
act
count
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
corvette
had
been
taken
from
pennsylvania
to
ohio,
and
on
the
check
charges,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
because
the
government
had
failed
to
prove
as
required
by
this
paragraph
of
the
statute
that
the
checks
were
in
a
forged
or
altered
condition
prior
to
their
interstate
transportation.
the
judge
denied
both
the
motions,
and
charged
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
points
for
charge
presented
by
the
government
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
checks
be
in
a
forged
or
altered
condition
so
long
as
they
could
show
or
the
jury
found
that
the
checks
were
moving
in
interstate
commerce
in
a
forged
or
altered
condition
solely
in
the
destination
state.
now,
the
defendant
petitioner
here
was
convicted.
he
received
a
five-year
sentence
on
the
dyer
act
count
and
seven-year
sentences
on
the
check
counts,
all
the
sentences
to
run
concurrently.
on
appeal
to
the
third
circuit,
they
said
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
convict
on
the
dyer
act
count,
because
the
indictment
charged
him
with
taking
the
automobile
from
ohio...
sorry,
from
pennsylvania
into
ohio,
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
automobile
ever
went
into
ohio.
but
on
the
check
charges,
they
said
that
the
judge's
charge
was
correct,
and
they
held
chat
it
was
not
necessary
under
this
statute
for
the
government
to
prove
that
the
checks
were
in
a
forged
or
altered
condition
prior
to
their
interstate
transportation
and
prior
to
crossing
state
lines.
when
they
so
held
that,
they
held
directly
in
conflict
with
the
tenth,
eight,
and
fifth
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
which
have
held
with
regard
to
this
paragraph
of
2314
that
it
is
clear
and
obvious
from
a
reading
of
this
statute,
because
of
the
tenses
used
and
so
forth,
that
this
statute
means
that
the--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is...
i
don't
want
to
say
what
they
had
in
their
mind.
they
just
said
a
reading
is
obvious,
but
i
will
attempt
to--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--"forged",
your
honor.
past
tense.
the
forged
checks
prior
to
the
interstate
transportation.
it
is
the
way
the
statute--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
but
the
way
the
tenses
are
set
up
in
the
structure
of
the
section;
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
that,
and
i
will
demonstrate
that,
your
honor,
by
the
congressional
history.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
your
honor,
if
it
is
clear,
you
do
not,
and
our
first
submission
here
is
that
it
is
not
ambiguous,
it
is
clear
on
its
face
that
what
it
means
is
that
the
checks
must
be
in
a
forged
condition
before
they
enter
interstate
commerce,
but
our
fallback
position,
your
honor,
and
our
second
position
is,
if
this
wording
is
ambiguous,
then
this
court
should
utilize
the
rule
of
lenity.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
your
honor,
you
are
right.
of
course,
you
would
not
thwart
the
will
of
congress
if
you
could
show
clearly
by
the
legislative
history
what
congress
meant.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
even
though
the
words
might
be
ambiguous.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
contrary
evidence
to
sustain
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
no.
if
you
forge
a
check
and
cross
a
state
line,
you
are
guilty.
if
you
take
a
blank
check
and
cross
a
state
line,
and
then
forge
it--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--you
have
not
violated
this
section.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
no,
your
honor.
yes,
i
think
i
would
say
that,
if
it
is
a
continuous
movement.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
you
are
right,
your
honor,
and
they
took
care
of
that
provision.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
no,
not
under
this
section.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
a
blank
check.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
no,
your
honor.
may
i
suggest--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--okay.
your
honor,
may
i
suggest
that
congress
when
they
passed
this
act,
the
national
stolen
properties
act,
took
care
of
the
situation
that
the
defendant
was
here
charged
with.
they
took
care
of
it
in
section
4,
which
now
became
section
2315,
which
provides
with
regard
to
the
same
activity,
"whoever
receives,
conceals,
stores,
barters,
sells,
or
disposes
of
any
falsely
made,
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited
securities
moving
as
or
which
are
a
part
of
or
which
constitute
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
"
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
whole
problem
in
this
case
is
strictly
this,
that
the
government
failed
to
indict
him
under
the
right
section.
had
they
charged
him
under
2315,
it
would
have
fit
the
facts.
having
charged
him
under
2314,
they
then
tried
to
pull
themselves
up,
and
act
like
procrusteas,
and
try
to
stretch
the
language
of
2314
to
make
it
fit
a
situation
which
was
governed
by
2315.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
it
would
have
taken
care
of
it,
and
they
did
in
the
first
paragraph,
your
honor.
you
see,
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
statute,
it
provides
against
the
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
merchandise,
but
congress
has
a
$5,000
limit.
now,
i
don't
want
to
concede
that
he
could
have
been
convicted
under
that
statute,
but
both
of
these
checks
were
over
$5,000.
i
simply
find
in
this
case
that
the
government
charged
him
under
the
wrong
statute.
the
legislative
history--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
paragraph,
second
paragraph
of
2315,
your
honor,
the
reading
is
almost
exactly
the
same.
"whoever
receives,
conceals,
stores,
barters--
"
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--i
am
quoting
from--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
we
don't
have
that
whole
statute
set
out,
your
honor,
but
it
is
in
the
second
paragraph
of
2315.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor,
you
could
do
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor,
but
they
didn't
charge
him
with
2315.
that
has
been
the
whole
point.
and
as
the
dissenter
pointed
out
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
en
banc
decision,
they
could
have
also
probably
convicted
this
man
under
section...
under
the
last
paragraph
of
2314.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
that's
right,
many
others.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no
question
under
this
particular
section
of
the
statute
that
he
was
not
validly
convicted.
when
congress
passed
the
national
stolen
properties
act,
they
did
not
rely
on
the
words
"interstate
commerce"
as
defined
by
this
court.
the
government
attempts
to
show
that
by
going
back
to
the
dyer
act,
and
it
says
they
can't
find
anything
that
would
indicate
the
will
of
congress
with
regard
to
the
national
stolen
properties
act.
your
honor,
when
the
national
stolen
property
act
was
passed,
congress
put
their
own
definition
of
interstate
commerce
into
the
statute,
and
they
didn't
give
anybody
any
leeway
to
interpret
it.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--because
of
the
"moving
as"
language,
your
honor.
it
is
clear
that
"moving
as,
constituting
a
part
of
interstate
commerce.
"
is
different
than
having
an
act
that
is
committed
prior
to
the
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
what
i
think
the
whole
act
was...
these
two
sections
were
designed
to
do,
and
remember,
2314
and
2315
were
one
section
in
the
national
stolen
properties
act.
but
this
definition
that
congress
put
in
provided
as
follows.
"the
term
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
shall
mean
transportation
from
one
state,
territory,
or
the
district
of
columbia
to
another
state.
"
et
cetera.
now,
reading
the
statute
as
with
that
language
in
it,
it
would
read,
"whoever
with
unlawful
or
fraudulent
intent
transports
from
one
state
to
another
a
falsely
made,
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited
security.
"
which
clearly
sets
up
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
your
honor,
yes,
but
if
we
are
looking
to
divine
the
will
of
congress
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
definition
that
they
used.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
your
honor,
if
that
were
the
case,
then
that
would
swallow
up
2315.
you
would
never
need
2315.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
have
2315.
and
that
is
our
point.
when
you
read
it
with
"from
state
to
state"
it
means
that
the
document
has
to
be
in
a
forged
condition
prior
to
its
transportation.
now,
i
will
admit
that
the
definition
that
i
told
you
that
congress
had
implanted
into
the
act
was
taken
out
by
the
general
code
revisions
in
1949,
and
was
replaced
by
section
10,
but
the
drafters
of
those
sections,
and
when
they
revised
2314
and
2315,
noted
that
there
was
no
change
in
substance,
there
was
merely
changes
in
minor
phraseology,
and
therefore
that
leaves
us
with
the
same
intent
and
the
same
expression
of
congress's
will.
furthermore,
the
act
has
been
amended
several
times
to
provide
for
the
same
prohibitions
with
tax
stamps
and
forged
countersignatures
on
traveler's
checks,
and
in
several
other
ways.
nobody
has
ever
bothered
to
change
the
definition
or
make
it
clearer
or
anything,
and
furthermore,
when
they
put
in...
when
congress
wants
to
show
in
2314
what
it
is
that
they
want
to
cover,
in
the
third
paragraph
it
reads...
i
am
sorry,
in
the
second
paragraph,
"whoever
having
devised
or
intended
to
devise
any
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
or
the
obtaining
money
or
property
by
means
of
false
or
fraudulent
pretenses.
"
they
can
speak
in
language
of
intent
now
and
intent
later,
not
in
the
third
paragraph
of
this
statute.
it
is
to
my
mind
clear
and
unambiguous,
and
three
circuits
have
so
found,
and
that
basically
is
our
position.
we
would
cite
the
court,
of
course,
to
your
case
of
united
states
versus
barrett,
where
justice
blackmun
said
that
where
congress
has
utilized
verb
tenses
and
subrogated
them
throughout
the
entire
act,
and
seemed
to
know
what
they
were
doing
when
they
did
it,
then
we
will
give
full
weight
and
be
influenced
by
that
to
a
great
degree,
and
in
this
case
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
we
have.
if
there
is
an
ambiguity,
then
that
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
because
congress's
will
has
certainly
not
been
unerringly
clear
in
this
situation.
otherwise,
we
wouldn't
have
these
three
circuits'
courts
of
appeals,
and
one
was
an
en
banc
decision
reading
this
statute
so
clearly.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--engaging
in
the
theft.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor,
he
could
do
that,
but
remember,
he
is
not
charged
with
the
theft.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--you
are
talking
about
the
first
paragraph,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
the
first
paragraph.
that
has
the
$5,000
limit.
he
couldn't
have
been
charged...
he
wasn't
charged
with
that.
you
see,
the
government
was
very
specific
in
this
case.
at
the
trial,
the
government
attorney
announced
to
the
court
clearly
what
we
have
here
and
what
i
am
charging
this
man
with
is
a
violation
of
the
third
paragraph
of
2314.
there
was
never
any
question
that
he
was
not
being
charged
with
anything
else...
or
that
he
was
being
charged
with
anything
else
other
than
that
one
paragraph.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
it
is
a
shorthand
way
of
saying
it,
your
honor,
the
paragraph
that
is
involved,
because
we
clearly
pointed
out
the
paragraph,
your
honor,
and
the
whole
record
is
replete
with
the
fact
that
the
judge
and
the
u.
s.
attorney
and
the
attorney
and
the
defendant
all
realized
exactly
what
he
was
being
charged
with,
and
that
is
what
went
on
in
the
court
of
appeals
also.
there
is
no
question
about
the
specificity
of
the
charges
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes,
your
honor.
again,
the
government
has
not
paid
any
attention
to
the
fact
that
when
this
act
was
passed,
congress
put
a
definition
into
it,
and
did
not
rely
on
the
broad
interpretation
of
interstate
commerce
that
he
would
suggest
upon
which
they
relied.
furthermore,
it
isn't
just
the
rule
of
lenity
that
is
involved,
but
a
public
policy
that
justice
marshal
spoke
of
in
united
states
versus
bass.
it
is
so
that
this
court
and
any
court
can
know
exactly
what
it
is
that
the
man
is
being
tried
on,
and
that
people
know
what
they
are
being
tried
on.
when
this
statute
says,
and
uses
the
language
here,
"whoever
transports
a
forged
document
in
interstate
commerce.
"
and
then
congress
defines
the
words
"interstate
commerce"
as
meaning
from
state
to
state,
it
is
clear
what
he
looks
at.
the
difference--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--yes,
your
honor,
for
this.
you
do,
because,
your
honor,
you
see,
in
2315
congress
met
that
eventuality.
the
situation
posed
by
justice
white
is
clearly
covered
by
2315.
again,
i
say
that
all
the
government
failed
to
do
in
this
case
is
charge
under
the
right
statute
and
the
right
section.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
but
it
is
in
the
same
statute,
justice.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
but
when
they
want
to
do
that,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
they
know
how
to
do
it.
they
did
it
in
the
second
paragraph
of
2314.
"whoever
devises
or
plans
to
devise
a
scheme.
"
and
so
forth.
and
they
have
never
amended
that,
and
three
circuits
have
read
it
that
it
is
plain
and
clear
that
what
it
means
is
that
under
this
particular
paragraph,
not
even
the
whole
section,
just
this
same
paragraph,
it
means
what
it
says.
the
check
has
to
be
forged
before
its
interstate
transportation.
if
the
government
wants
to
charge
somebody
under
both
sections,
there
is
no
prohibition
against
that.
they
could
have
charged
him
with
four
or
five
sections,
and
perhaps
sustained
a
valid
conviction.
they
didn't
do
it
in
this
case,
and
now
the
man
stands
convicted
of
the
third
paragraph
of
2314,
and
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do,
as
i
say,
is
stretch
that
language
all
out
of
proportion
to
what
it
was
intended
to
cover
because
congress
already
covered
that
in
the
section
2315--
mr.
thomas
s.
white
--and
that
is
why
the
courts
draw
that
distinction.
mr.
thomas
s.
white
yes.
you
will
notice
that
the
barfield
case
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
same
court
that
decided
owens
under
2314.
the
reason
is
that
it
was
easily
sustainable
in
barfield
as
a
continuation
because
the
man
was
riding
in
the
car,
he
was
clearly
chargeable
under
section
2
as
a
principal,
a
fact
that
you
don't
have
in
this
case.
they
didn't
need
any
broad
interpretation
of
2312,
because
you
have
section
2.
if
i
drive
a
car
halfway
across
the
state,
and
you
and
i
are
planning
to
drive
a
stolen
car
from
pittsburgh
to
cleveland,
and
i
do
part
of
the
driving
and
you
do
part
of
the
driving
to
move
it
along,
there
is
no
question
i
am
an
aider
and
a
better
and
a
principal
under
section
2.
that
clearly
distinguishes
barfield
from
the
case
that
we
have
here,
and
explains
why
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
same
court
that
drew
this
distinction.
they
would
have
held,
under
2314,
that
it
is
necessary
that
it
be
a
stolen...
a
stolen
car,
which
it
was
in
barfield,
that
crossed
the
state
line.
here,
the
question
is,
was
it
just
a
check
or
was
it
a
forged
check
that
crossed
the
state
line,
and
that
is
the
distinguishing
factor
in
that
case.
