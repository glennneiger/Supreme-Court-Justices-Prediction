unknown
speaker
you
say,
when
he
presented
it,
it
was
altered
and
forged.
do
you
mean
by
that
that
the
forgery
and
alteration
had
taken
place
prior
to
the
presentation?
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
the
alteration
or
forgery
occurred
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
that
from?
unknown
speaker
was
justice
storey
talking
about
the
criminal
law
area?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
the
whole
statute,
it
is
just
two
words
they
rely
on,
right?
"have
been"?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
other
words
can
you
get
your
argument
out
of?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
that
says
the
check
has
to
be
forged
before
it
is
transferred.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear,
do
we
need
to
go
to
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
some
cases
that
say,
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
in
the
face
of
what
might
be
clear
legislative
history,
even
though
the
words
are
ambiguous?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
words
themselves
might
be
ambiguous?
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
like
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
you
forge
a
check
or
a
security,
and
you
get
across
a
state
line,
you
are
free?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
free.
unknown
speaker
and
you
can
cross
eight
other
state
lines?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
realize
that
it
doesn't
make
sense,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
congress
was
against
transporting
forged
securities.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
was
a
forged
security,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
when
it
was
presented,
it
was
forged,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
had
crossed
the
state
line,
right?
unknown
speaker
it
had
crossed...
the
check
had
crossed
the
state
line.
unknown
speaker
a
check
had
crossed
a
state
line.
unknown
speaker
and
when
it
was
presented,
it
was
forged.
unknown
speaker
and
that,
in
any
reading
of
the
statute,
violates
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
else
is
there
in
the
statute
that
you
have
to
show?
unknown
speaker
you
would
say,
i
take
it,
or
would
you,
if
there
was
a
question,
would
you
say
that
the
proof
would
have
been
satisfied
in
this
kind
of
a
case
if
the
statute,
after
the
word
"transports
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
"
any
"stolen",
insert
the
word
"stolen",
comma,
"falsely
made",
comma,
"forged",
comma,
"altered"?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
is
the
section
you
are
relying
on
the
section
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
of
your
brief,
the
section...
that
is
the
one
you
are
talking
about,
2314?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
refer
to
forged
securities,
though,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading?
that
is
what
i
want
to
know.
what
is
it
you
are
quoting
from?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
is
not
in
the
brief.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
is
it
possible
to
violate
two
acts?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering.
unknown
speaker
i'll
bet
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
he
could
be
convicted
of,
too.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
mr.
white,
certainly
in
the
tobin
case
and
in
the
barfield
case,
the
parallel
language
in
the
adjacent
two
statutes
has
been
interpreted
exactly
as
the
government
is
asking
that
it
be
interpreted
here.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
quite
a
narrower
reading
than
the
actual
language
of
the
statute
itself.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
we
first
look
to
the
statute?
the
language
of
2314
itself?
which
says,
"whoever
with
unlawful
or
fraudulent
intent
transports
in
interstate
commerce
any
forged
security.
"
i
don't
think
it
is
unreasonable
to
say
that
when
they
talk
about
transporting
in
interstate
commerce,
they
referred
to
the
entire
journey,
and
if
the
forgery
takes
place
at
any
time
during
that
journey,
the
violation
is
complete.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
he
knew
that
that
check
had
been
stolen
when
he--
unknown
speaker
--there
isn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
old
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
possession
of
recently
stolen
property?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
just
reading
the
statute.
whoever
transports
in
interstate
commerce,
and
so
forth,
any
securities,
and
so
forth,
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
stolen,
converted,
or
taken
by
fraud.
unknown
speaker
of
2314.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
brief...
i
am
reading
from
page
3,
going
over
to
4,
recites
that
he
was
charged
of
doing
this
in
violation
of
2314.
unknown
speaker
very
well.
mr.
phillips?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
suppose
a
check
is
stolen
in
pittsburgh
and
the
check
stays
in
pennsylvania
all
the
time
but
it
is
stolen
by
somebody
from
cleveland,
and
he
leaves
the
check
in
pennsylvania
with
his
colleagues
and
goes
back
to
cleveland,
and
then
he
goes
to...
makes
a
trip
to
pittsburgh,
picks
up
the
check,
and
goes
to
philadelphia,
forges
it
in
philadelphia,
and
does
whatever
he
did
with
it
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
if
you
mean
literally
what
your
submission
is,
that
there
is
an
interstate
movement
from
cleveland
to
philadelphia.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
check
itself
crosses
a
state
line
or
not.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
there
is
interstate
commerce.
there
is
movement
in
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
check
is
being
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
the
fellow
drives
from
cleveland
to
pittsburgh,
picks
up
the
check,
and
goes
on
to
philadelphia,
one
movement.
the
check
is
moving
in
interstate
commerce,
just
as
surely
as
if
the
check
was
moved
from
cleveland
to
pittsburgh.
unknown
speaker
the
jury...
if
the
court
instructed
that
you
may
find
that
the
statute
is
satisfied
if
the
check
just
moves
from
pittsburgh
to
philadelphia,
would
you
object
to
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
begin
moving
in
interstate
commerce
as
soon
as
they
picked
it
up.
it
became
part
of
an
interstate
trip.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sure
you
would.
if
that
was
part
of
his
plan.
unknown
speaker
is
there
or
is
there
not
a
requirement
in
the
statute
that
the
check
ever
cross
a
state
line?
unknown
speaker
why
would
there
be
any
difference?
suppose
you
have
the
same
facts
you
have
here,
except
as
justice
white
suggests,
the
theft
was
from
pittsburgh,
but
yet
he
lived
in
ohio,
and
he
called
up
from
the
ohio
turnpike
to
beaver
falls
and
said,
i
am
on
my
way
in,
i
am
going
to
pick
up
the
check
in
pittsburgh
and
deliver
it
to
you.
he
did
exactly
that,
but
it
was
a
forged
check.
wasn't
that
exactly
like
this
case?
sure.
unknown
speaker
so
under
your
theory
it
would
be
all
right.
there
is
just
as
much
basis
for
requiring
the
check
to
cross
the
line
in
a
forged
condition
as
there
is
to
have
the
check
cross
the
line
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
check
is,
on
your
theory.
you
say
there
is
a
whole
movement.
unknown
speaker
a
whole
movement,
and
if
the
check
is
part
of
it
at
all,
it
is
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
it
doesn't
have
to
cross
the
line.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips.
unknown
speaker
take
two
cases.
one,
that
this
court
says
that
you
have
to
forge
the
check
before
you
cross
the
state
line,
and
you
try
a
man,
and
he
says,
i
forged
it
after
i
crossed
the
state
line.
secondly,
this
court
says,
you
only
can
be
guilty
if
you
forge
it
after
you
cross
the
state
line,
and
the
man
is
brought
in,
and
he
says,
i
forged
it
before
i
crossed
the
state
line.
wouldn't
both
of
them
go
free?
unknown
speaker
if
the
rule
is
that
way.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
what
do
you
say
about
his
argument
that
you
just
used
the
wrong
statutory
provision,
that
you
should
have
indicted
under
2315?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
just
agreed
he
doesn't
really
have
to
carry
it
across
state
lines,
i
thought,
in
order
to
come
within
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--whereas...
and
that
is
even
clearer...
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we
agreed
on
that.
that
your
position
does
not
require
that
the
security
ever
cross
state
lines,
it
merely
requires
that
it
be
transported
during
a
part
of
an
interstate
journey.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
get
a
commuter,
if
he
picks
up
the
forgery
check
after
he
crosses
the
state
line.
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
just
wondering
if
there
is
much
of
a
federal
interest
at
stake
here
if
there
is
another
statutory
provision
that
covers
this
precise--
unknown
speaker
--situation?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
receives,
conceals,
stores,
barters,
sells,
or
disposes
of.
there
is
clearly--
unknown
speaker
well,
as
has
been
suggested
by
some
questions,
must
you
show
crossing
a
state
line
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
argument...
but
2314
and
2315
aren't
mutually
exclusive
in
their
coverage,
and
there
really
is
no
reason
to
think
that
every
statute
congress
passes
is
mutually
exclusive
from
another
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
conceivably
they
could
have
been
aiming
at
two
slightly
different
things
but
there
would
have
been
some
overlap.
unknown
speaker
mr.
white?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
section
2312,
which
i
tried
to
ask
you
about
before,
which
deals
with
transporting
in
interstate
commerce
a
motor
vehicle
or
aircraft
knowing
it
to
have
been
stolen,
in
the
barfield
case,
the
court
placed
the
exact
interpretation
on
that
language
which
is
parallel
to
that
that
we
have
here.
