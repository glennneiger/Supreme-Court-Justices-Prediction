justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
two
counts
of
transporting
a
forged
security
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
18
u.s.
code
section
2314.
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
several
blank
checks
were
stolen
from
a
labor
union
in
ohio.
a
number
of
months
later
in
pennsylvania,
the
petitioner
paid
for
an
automobile
and
then
a
boat
and
trailer
with
the
stolen
union
checks
on
which
signatures
had
been
forged.
the
government
produced
no
evidence
at
trial
to
prove
that
the
signatures
have
been
forged
on
the
checks
before
petitioner
took
them
across
the
state
line,
from
ohio
to
pennsylvania.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
an
order
to
find
petitioner
guilty
under
section
2314,
it
must
find
that
he
transported
the
checks
in
a
forged
condition
in
interstate
commerce.
and
that
such
transportation
could
take
place
entirely
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania
if
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
movement
that
began
out-of-state.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed
petitioner's
convictions.
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
specifically
the
use
of
the
term
interstate
commerce
as
well
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
dyer
act
on
which
section
2314
was
patterned
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
as
this
court
has
previously
held,
interstate
commerce
begins
before
state
lines
are
crossed
and
ends
only
when
movement
has
ceased
in
the
destination
state.
we
hold
that
in
section
2314,
congress
intended
to
proscribe
the
transportation
of
a
forged
security
at
any
and
all
times
during
the
course
of
its
movement
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce
may
continue
after
a
state
border
has
been
crossed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent.
