mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
limited
to
the
issue
of
the
proper
scope
of
the
interstate
commerce
requirement
in
section
2314
of
title
xviii
of
the
united
states
code.
specifically,
the
issue
is
whether
in
a
prosecution
for
transporting
a
forged
security
in
interstate
commerce,
the
government
must
prove
that
the
security
in
question
was
forged
prior
to
the
time
the
security
reached
its
destination
state
or
whether
instead
the
government
need
only
prove
that
a
security
was
transported
between
one
or
more...
between
two
or
more
states,
and
that
prior
to
the
time
it
reached
its
ultimate
destination,
that
security
was
in
a
forged
condition.
petitioner
has
adequately
stated
the
facts,
and
i
think
it
is
abundantly
clear
from
those
facts
that
what
is
at
issue
here
is
the
transportation
of
a
security
from
ohio
to
pennsylvania,
and
the
only
question
that
is
open
is
when
was
the
forgery,
and
there
is
essentially
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
when
the
actual
signature
was
placed
on
the
specific
security.
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
that
if
you
believe
that
the
government
has
shown
that
the
defendant
transported
the
checks
while
they
were
in
a
forged
condition
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
satisfied
if
that
transportation
was
part
of
interstate
commerce.
that
was
the
instruction
offered
by
the
government,
and
it
was
over
the
objection
of
the
petitioner.
the
jury
convicted
on
that
instruction,
and
so
there
is
no
dispute
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
conviction
on
the
basis
of
the
third
paragraph
of
section
2314.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction
on
section
2314,
and
it
did
so
en
banc.
nine
of
the
ten
judges
on
the
third
circuit
adopted
the
theory
of
the
government
in
this
case.
the
concurring
opinion
by
judge
adams...
or,
excuse
me,
the
dissenting
and
concurring
opinion
by
judge
adams
dissented
solely
from
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
on
the
dyer
act
count.
judge
garth
in
his
dissenting
opinion
agreed
with
the
theory
of
the
government's
case
but
disagreed
with
the
proof
showing
that
the
security
in
question
had
been
transported
from
ohio
to
pennsylvania.
and
finally,
only
judge
higginbotham
dissented
basically
relying
on
the
decisions
of
the
three
other
courts
of
appeals
that
have
held
similar
to
the
way
that
petitioner
argues
in
this
case.
frankly,
from
the
government's
perspective
it
is
fairly
unusual
for
three
courts
of
appeals
to
interpret
the
same
provision
in
a
way
that
we
believe
is
so
fundamentally
wrong,
and
so
it
seems
appropriate
to
begin
our
analysis
by
attempting
to
explain
how
three
courts
of
appeals
have
gone
off
on
that
ground.
petitioner
in
his
submission
has
relied
heavily
on
the
presence
of
those
decisions.
the
source
of
the
law
in
this
area
begins
in
1961
in
united
states
versus
castle,
a
case
in
which
the
fortuity
of
events,
which
was
primarily
a
confession
on
the
part
of
a
defendant
that
he
had
forged
documents
in
maryland
and
then
transported
those
securities
into
texas,
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
quite
properly
as
stating
each
of
the
elements
of
a
conviction
under
paragraph
3
of
section
2314.
that
factual
oddity
was
suddenly
transformed
into
an
element
of
the
defense
indicta,
frankly,
by
the
same
court
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit,
in
united
states
versus
owens.
in
owens,
the
evidence
simply
proved
that
the
defendant
had
attempted
to
cash
securities
that
could
be
linked
back
eventually
to
new
jersey,
the
securities
having
been
cashed
in
louisiana.
unfortunately
for
the
government,
there
was
no
proof
really
as
to
how
the
securities
had
reached
louisiana,
nor
even
how
the
defendant
in
that
case
had
come
by...
had
obtained
those
securities,
and
therefore
there
was
no
real
proof
of
transportation.
the
court
threw
out
the
conviction
on
the
basis
that
there
was
inadequate
evidence.
unfortunately
indeed
for
the
government,
in
doing
so,
the
court
also
said
that
the
important
element
that
was
missing
was
the
failure
to
prove
the
fraud
at
the
time
of
the
interstate
passage,
moving
away
from
the
interstate
commerce
language,
which
is
the
linchpin
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
that
language
in
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
used
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
subsequent
decision
involving
a
section
2255
review
of
a
guilty
plea
under
section
2314
where
the
defendant
in
that
case
had
plead
to
having
transported
securities
from
one
state
to
another.
the
court
found
that
there
had
been
no
proof
that
those
checks
had
been
forged
in
the
state
of
origin
and
then
transported,
thereby
truly
effectuating
the
final
development
of
the
rule
that
petitioner
seeks
to
have
adopted
by
this
court.
that
decision
then
was
followed
in
turn
by
the
tenth
circuit
en
banc.
the
decision
in
sparrow,
i
submit,
reflects
nothing
more
than
the
desire
of
the
tenth
circuit
to
avoid
a
conflict
among
the
circuits.
it
essentially
recites
the
prior
decisions
in
this
area
and
does
little
more
than
cite
the
rule
of
lenity
as
a
basis
for
its
ultimate
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
is
difficult
to
know
exactly,
because
the
key
to
this
is
going
to
be
whether
or
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no,
the
check
itself
has
to
cross
the
state
line
as--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
at
some
point,
it
would
be
difficult--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
the
defendant.
we
are
not
submitting
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
some
movement
of
the
forged
security.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
may
be
that
it
is
in
interstate
commerce.
the
question...
there
would
be
essentially
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
ever
became
in
interstate
commerce,
and
it
may
well
be
on
the
facts--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
may
be
true,
and
i
am
not...
if
a
jury
were
to
convict
on
that
theory,
we
would
be
here
defending
that
conviction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
can
imagine
that
there...
it
would
generally
not
be
the
case
that
that
would
ever
have
become
in
interstate
commerce,
because
the
check
has
never
begun
to
move
in
interstate
commerce.
the
only
person
who
has
moved--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
suppose
that
you
might
say
that
the
defendant's
movement
from
cleveland
to
pittsburgh
was
sufficient
to
create
a
movement
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
that
was
part
of
his
plan.
but
we
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
that
is
all
a
continuous
movement,
and
certainly
if
that
kind
of
movement,
relying
on
an
individual
from
cleveland
to
take
up
the
check
and
move
it
along,
is
designed
in
some
way
along...
to
avoid
detection,
then
it
even
falls
clearly
within
the
intendment
of
what
congress
wanted
under
section
2314.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
certainly
we
need
go
no
further
than
that
in
this
case,
obviously,
because
the
check
did
go
across
the
state
line.
i
would
think
it
would
be
generally
difficult
to
make
out
a
case
when
the
check
doesn't
move
across
state
lines.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
and
that
was
the
basis,
i
suppose,
for
judge
garth's
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
saying
the
evidence
was
insufficient
because
we
couldn't
prove
that
he
hadn't
just
picked
up
the
checks
from--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
so,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
statute
says
is
that
you
must
transport
in
interstate
commerce.
it
is
the
check
that
must
be
in
interstate
commerce,
not
the
defendant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
but
we
are
not
saying,
moving
as
in
interstate
commerce.
we
are
simply
saying
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
the
rule
is
as
you
state
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
sir.
we
would
have
some
difficulty.
and
i
suppose
that
is
why
we
take
the
position
we
do
here,
which
is
that
we
simply
cannot
prove
when
the
defendant
forges
the
check.
there
are
few
events
that
are
more
a
secret
than
the
timing
of
a
forgery,
and
that
is
why
we
think
that
in
this
situation
we
have
proved
out
all
that
is
required
under
the
statute.
as
i
suggest,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fifth,
eighth,
and
tenth
circuits,
although
they
have
in
fact
reached
results
contrary
to
the
ones
we
assert
in
this
case,
supply
petitioner
with
very
little
assistance
in
this
case,
because
those
decisions
are
not
based
on
the
sort
of
building
blocks
of
statutory
interpretation
one
would
expect
to
be
used,
that
is,
the
specific
language
used
in
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
behind
the
statute,
and
the
relationship
of
this
provision
to
other
comparable
provisions
in
the
code.
we
reject,
i
think
quite
easily,
the
argument
of
petitioner
that
there
is
a
clear
meaning
to
this
statute
that
precludes
this
prosecution.
petitioner's
clear
meaning
from
the
statute
is
derived
solely
from
the
notion
that
would
only
make
sense
in
the
context
of
this
statute
precluded
the
transportation
across
a
state
line
of
a
security,
but
that
is
not
what
this
statute
requires.
instead,
it
forbids
transportation
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
only
way
to
know
what
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
violates
the
statute
can
be
decided
by
reference
to
the
legislative
intent.
we
suggest
that
the
statute
is
at
least
ambiguous
enough
to
require
us
to
look
to
what
congress
intended.
by
doing
that,
it
seems
to
us
very
clear
that
the
interstate
commerce
requirement
in
the
statute
is
designed
to
be
a
much
broader
concept
than
the
idea
of
crossing
a
state
line.
congress
knew
in
1919,
it
knew
in
1934,
and
it
knew
in
1939
how
the
phrase
"interstate
commerce"
had
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
and
it
relied
on
that
broad
concept
that
movement
in
interstate
commerce
as
a
basis
and
with
the
desire
to
stop
that
kind
of
movement
in
interstate
commerce.
so
that
the
semantic
argument,
it
seems
to
us,
if
anything,
is
quite
clear
in
our
favor.
moreover,
our
semantic
argument
is
buttressed
significantly
by
the
policy
of
this
act,
which
is
to
crush
frauds
committed
on
interstate
commerce
by
use
of
the
forged
securities,
and
that
policy
is
fully
implemented
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
petitioner
has
shown
himself
capable
of
running
back
and
forth
between
the
states
of
ohio
and
pennsylvania,
making
detection
of
his
crime
difficult,
and
making
the...
and
if
there
were
not
a
provision
like
this,
making
prosecution
for
his
crime
quite
difficult.
it
seems
to
me
that
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
may
well
be
that
petitioner
has
violated
several
statutes,
but
one
that
he
clearly
violated
was
section
2314.
i
don't
see
any
necessary
problem.
the
point
is,
he
carried
this
security
across
state
lines
and
held
it
for
a
while
and
used
it
for
various
purposes.
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
could
have
prosecuted--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
he
doesn't
have
to,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
part
of
a...
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
as
long
as
it
is
all
part
of
a
single
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
another
provision
that
covers
this
precise--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--situation.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
2315,
which
is
more
concerned
with
receipt
of
these
kinds
of
securities,
covers
a
different
activity.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
but
those
all
involve
additional
activities
that
are
regarded
as
inimical
by
congress,
so
that
it
would
seem
to
me
the
fact
that
he
has
done
more
than
one
thing
certainly
is
no
basis
for
denying
the
government
the
right
to
prosecute
him
on
this
basis.
it
seems
to
me
ultimately
that
the
only
basis
that...
the
only
argument
petitioner
really
has
in
this
case
is
the
rule
of
lenity,
and
as
i
think
is
fairly
clear,
the
rule
of
lenity
is
only
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
really
a
rule
in
many
ways
designed
simply
for
separation
of
powers...
interests.
that
is
that
we
want
to
make
sure
that
congress
declares
what
crimes
exist
and
how
they
ought
to
be
punished,
and
as
i
hope
i
have
suggested
already,
congress
has
spoken
very
broadly
in
this
statute,
and
clearly
to
include
this
conduct
as
within
the
prohibition
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honors,
i
would
ask
you
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
in
this
case.
