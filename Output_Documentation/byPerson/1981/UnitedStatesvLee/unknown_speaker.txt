unknown
speaker
at
the
time
he
made
the
first
quarterly
payment,
mr.
wallace,
what
were
his
alternatives?
was
he
subject
to
a
likely
seizure
or
levying
on
his
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
his
act
at
that
time
in
paying
presumably
did
not
compromise
his
religious
beliefs
because
he
had
no
choice,
no
real
choice.
if
he
wanted
to
continue
his
business,
he
had
to
yield
to
the
government's
demand.
unknown
speaker
he
is
still
claiming
here
today--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace,
in
the
face
of
that
finding
of
the
district
court
that
it
was
a
sin
not
only
to
accept
but
also
a
sin
to
pay
these
taxes,
can
the
court
go
behind
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
decide
this
case
by
accepting--
unknown
speaker
--by
accepting
that
holding,
that
it
is
a
sin
to
pay
as
well
as--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
rely
on
the
balancing
aspect.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
that--
unknown
speaker
--does
that
imply
then
that
you
don't
question
that
to
pay
would
seriously
infringe
upon
his
free
exercise
rights?
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
nevertheless,
to
the
extent
that
infringes
upon
free
exercise
rights,
i
gather
the
government's
position
is
that
the
governmental
interest,
what,
overrides?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
give
way
to
the
governmental
interest?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is--
unknown
speaker
--what
i
am
trying
to
get
at--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace,
wait,
will
you?
are
you
suggesting,
then,
that
this
is
a
strict
scrutiny
kind
of
analysis,
and
that
the
government
interest
under
strict
scrutiny
prevails
over
the
free
exercise
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
test
by
which
we
determine
that
the
free
exercise
right
must
give
way
to
the
governmental
interest?
unknown
speaker
congress
attempted
to
provide
some
relief
for
these
people,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
on
the
constitutional
point,
though,
if
he
believes
it
is
a
sin
for
him
to
pay
himself,
apparently
he
also
believes
that
it
is
a
sin
for
him
to
pay
for
workers
who
are
now
working
on
his
farm.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
the
exemption
with
respect
to
self-employed
amish
runs
afoul
of
the
establishment
clause?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but
at
present,
does
it
work
this
way,
that
the
exemption
applies
to
an
individual,
but
if
he
engaged
or
employed...
how
many
people
before
the
exemption
would
not
be
applicable?
unknown
speaker
so
if
he
had
a
single
employee,
the
exemption
would
not
be
applicable?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
perhaps
you
have
stated
it,
but
if
so,
i
have
missed
it.
what
is
the
situation
as
to
the
employees
here?
are
they
also
old
order
amish?
unknown
speaker
would
the
case
be
different
if
they
were
not?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
true
that
some
of
the
old
order
amish
have
left
the
faith?
unknown
speaker
the
record
doesn't
show
this?
unknown
speaker
is
this
report
number
213?
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
may
not
have
made
it
as
sharply
as
i
am
about
to
state
it,
i
took
the
sum
and
substance
of
your
position
in
the
brief
to
be
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
can't
run
a
nationwide
program
like
tax
collection
or
social
security
and
one
like
this
if
there
are
these
ad
hoc
exceptions,
except
as
congress
explicitly
makes
them.
is
that
pretty
close
to
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
how
do
you
distinguish
sherbert
against
verner,
or
the
thomas
case
of
last
year?
unknown
speaker
i
realize
you
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
thomas
last
year?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
wallace,
you
suggest
here
that
they
can
pay
the
taxes;
that
doesn't
stop
them
from
continuing
to
support
their
own
people.
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
distinction
from
sherbert
and
thomas
that
you
make.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
lose
what
thomas
and
verner,
or
sherbert,
or
whoever
it
was,
would
have
lost.
unknown
speaker
but
that
suggests
that
in
the
scale
of
values
the
economic
one
is
the
top
one
rather
than
the
religious
belief
of
the
particular
claimant.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
suggests
that
the
amish
would
stop
supporting
their
own
people
if
they
lost
this
case?
unknown
speaker
nothing
in
the
stipulation
or
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
to
prevent
them
from
having
all
of
the
social
security
or
the
other
payments
of
this
kind
come
back
to
a
fund,
the
same
kind
of
a
fund
that
the
amish
use
to
take
care
of
their
needy,
in
other
words,
so
that
it
wouldn't
come
back
to
assist
any
individual
except
through
the
group
operation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
to
identify
what
the
compelling
interest
is
of
the
government
in
requiring
the
amish
to
pay
into
the
social
security
system
under
the
stipulated
facts,
which
indicate
that
the
amish
will
not
be
withdrawing
from
the
fund,
and
there
is
very
little
in
the
record
that
i
can
find
that
would
focus
on
the
real
impact
on
the
government
of
allowing
them
not
to
pay.
unknown
speaker
how
does
this
square
with
thomas
of
last
year?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
it
does,
but
i
mean
taking
the
majority
in
both
cases.
unknown
speaker
the
court...
were
you
finished?
unknown
speaker
about
25
years
ago...
i
could
not
identify
the
cases...
was
there
not
a
series
of
cases
of
jehovah's
witnesses
and
other
groups,
perhaps
quakers,
who
are
strongly
opposed
to
war
in
any
form,
who
sought
to
have
the
aggregate
amount
of
the
income
taxes
levied
on
them
segregated
between
that
part
which
went
to
the
maintenance
of
the
military
and
the
civilian?
i
think
the
court
did
not
decide
any
of
them,
but
regularly
certiorari
was
denied
in
those
cases,
for
whatever
that
is
worth.
unknown
speaker
in
the
thomas
case
last
spring,
didn't
the
court
say
rather
clearly
that
the
judges
can't
get
into
the
business
of
parsing
out
the
doctrinal
differences
within
a
particular
faith?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
this
whole
social
security
system
an
organized
way
for
a
country
of
200
million
people
to
try
to
take
care
of
their
neighbors
in
an
organized,
institutionalized
way?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
does
the
record
show
that
any
employees
of
these
amish
were
not
amish?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
stipulation
doesn't
say
that
in
so
many
words,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
caiazza,
i
gather
from
what
you
have
said
that
if
you
lose
this
case,
the
amish
will
not
stop
following
their
religious
principle
which,
as
you
say,
underlies
this
whole
belief
of
taking
care
of
their
own.
unknown
speaker
they
will
continue.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
at
all
that
indicates
that
the
payment
of
these
taxes
in
any
wise
actually
burdens
their
ability
to
take
care
of
their
own?
unknown
speaker
does
that
suggest
that
it
is
a
sin
of
such
consequence
that
entirely
without
reference
to
their
ability
to
take
care
of
their
own,
it
is
an
offense
to
their
religion
to
pay--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
didn't
understand
that
the
government
was
questioning
at
all,
and
certainly
i
do
not,
the
sincerity
of
the
belief.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
cases
that
we
discussed
with
mr.
wallace?
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
it
was
really
a
political
belief.
they
were...
the
objectors
were
objecting
to
a
particular
war.
but
in
the
earlier
cases,
where
the
court
declined
to
review
similar
holdings,
there
were
religious
beliefs
asserted
against
all
wars.
now,
that
is
certainly
a
profound
belief,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
these
people
in
these
religious
groups
were
required
to
pay
their
share
of
the
cost
of
the
world
war
two
and
all
other
military
activities.
how
do
you
distinguish
that,
if
you
think
you
need
to
distinguish
it?
because
the
court
didn't
decide
it.
we
merely
decided
not
to
review
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
them
apparently
concede
that
the
government
interest
may
be
such
in
a
particular
case
that
would
override
the
free
exercise
infringement?
unknown
speaker
so
that
it
is
a
matter
of...
you
concede
it
is
a
matter
of
balancing
the
competing
interests?
unknown
speaker
and
you
simply
say
it
should
be
balanced
in
your
favor
here.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
federal
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
a
sin
under
some
religious
beliefs
to
pay
the
income
tax,
would
you
say
that
the
income
tax
could
nevertheless
be
collected?
unknown
speaker
and
the
property
tax?
unknown
speaker
are
any
of
those
deemed...
is
the
payment
of
any
of
those
taxes
deemed
to
be
a
sin?
unknown
speaker
mr.
caiazza,
suppose
we
come
to
the
day,
as
from
reading
the
newspapers
we
may,
when
we
have
to
fund
the
social
security
system
in
part,
at
least,
out
of
general
income
taxes?
what
then
would
be
the
amish
position?
unknown
speaker
you
are
familiar,
i
know,
with
the
polygamy
decisions
and
the
peyote
decisions
and
the
like--
unknown
speaker
--where
because
of
their
illegality,
as
i
recall
it,
those
cases
held
that
free
exercise
was
not
protected.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
those
cases?
non-payment
of
futa
and
fica
taxes
is
a
crime,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
can
be
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
those
old
cases?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
there
would
be
chaos
if
people
practiced
the
mormon
faith
as
it
was
some
decades
ago,
where
it
was
a
sin
not
to
take
several
wives,
for
example?
would
that
cause
chaos?
unknown
speaker
or
say
they
smoke
the
peyote
in
a
ritual
periodically.
would
that
cause
chaos
if
it
were
permitted?
unknown
speaker
does
your
case
turn
on
the
fact
that
they
will
not
participate
in
the
benefits,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
guarantee
that
the
employees
might
not
at
some
time
be
non-members
of
the
sect
or
might
leave
the
sect
before
they
become
eligible
for
benefits?
unknown
speaker
because
there
are
people
who
leave
the
faith,
are
there
not?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
taxpayer
here
is
concerned
about
protecting
his
employees
from
the
temptation
of
accepting
welfare
benefits
later
on?
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
another
religion
pops
up?
we
would
have
to
change
again,
wouldn't
we?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
such
as
the
amish.
another
religion
would
pop
up
and
say,
it's
a
sin
to
pay
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
old.
unknown
speaker
they
would
say,
we
date
back,
too.
unknown
speaker
and
we
would
have
how
many
different
tax
systems
in
this
country?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
everybody
is
striving
for
a
uniform
tax
system.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
a
reality
if
we
say,
you
are
just
like
everybody
else?
unknown
speaker
didn't
some
other
people
come
here
for
religious
freedom,
too?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
asking
that
the
amish
people
be
given
a
preferred
status
under
the
first
amendment,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
the
amish
and
the
mormon
faith
both
go
back
a
long
way
in
their
belief
that
a
practice
proscribed
by
the
congress
was
illegal.
unknown
speaker
and
nonetheless,
this
court
sustained
the
congressional
action.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
decide
whether
a
compelling
state
interest
is
justified
or
not?
do
the
nine
of
us
just
get
in
a
room
and
flip
a
coin?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
what
you
are
saying
to
us
is
that
they
have
their
own
little
social
security
system
and
insurance
within
their
own
church
organization.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
what
is
to
prevent
them
from
having
all
the
returns
which
came
to
individual
amish
paid
into
that
fund?
would
that
be
regarded
as
tainted
money,
because
it
has
gone
into
the
government
and
back
into
the
amish
fund?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
they
get
it
back,
haven't
they
washed
that
out?
unknown
speaker
they
must
use
money,
too,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
mr.
caiazza,
i
am
not
clear
yet
whether
you
would
take
the
same
position
you
are
taking
if
the
employees
were
not
amish.
would
it
still
be
a
sin
to
pay
the
tax,
the
social
security
tax?
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
would
your
argument
still
be
that
it
is
a
sin
to
pay
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
be
your
position
that
even
if
non-amish
employees
were
hired,
that
it
would
still
constitute
a
problem?
unknown
speaker
now,
would
that
not
in
effect
mean
that
the
government
is
running
into
establishment
clause
problems,
and
is
in
effect
favoring
the
amish
and
enabling
them
to
compete
in
a
manner
that
other
people
don't
have
to
contend
with?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you,
have
a
similar
problem
of
larger
magnitude
if
the
government
chose
to
tax,
say,
the
wine
that
people
of
jewish
faith
use
in
their
religious
rituals,
or
the
people
of
the
christian
faith
use
in
their
religious
rituals?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
heavily
taxed?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
many
people
think
it
is
immoral
to
fund
abortions
from
the
medicaid
component
of
social
security.
do
you
think
they
would
have
the
same
right
that
you
are
contending
for
here
today?
unknown
speaker
they
would
have
the
same
right.
unknown
speaker
quite
a
few
people
entertain
that
view.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
social
security
tax,
at
least
on
the
medicaid
component,
if
that
view
prevailed,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
that
old
decision
of
justice
stone?
wrong?
unknown
speaker
it
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
fleming
is
against
you,
too,
on
that
point,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
wrong,
too.
right?
you
say
that
is
wrong,
too?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
just
to
make
it
clear,
you
do
take
the
position
that
if
social
security
were
financed
out
of
general
revenues,
that
you
could
make
the
same
argument
about
the
regular
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
the
legal
question
will
be
different,
but
would
it
not
be
equally
a
sin
for
the
amish
to
pay
income
tax
if
the
income
tax
were
used
to
finance
welfare
programs
that
would
be
available
to
some
members--
unknown
speaker
--could
be?
it
would
be,
if
i
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
saying
the
governmental
interest
would
override.
