mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
caiazza.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
after
listening
to
the
questions
asked
by
the
court
and
the
government's
responses
thereto,
i
think
i
would
find
it
necessary
really
to
depart
from
the
prepared
argument
that
i
have
made,
because
i
feel
that
in
arguing
a
question
involving...
excuse
me...
questions
involving
the
freedom
of
religion
certainly
is
a
question
that
has
to
come
from
the
feelings
of
the
individual
practitioner
who
is
arguing
the
question.
perhaps
it
is
not
permissible
and
proper
for
an
attorney
to
become
so
personally
involved
with
a
particular
issue.
maybe
i
have
overstepped
my
bounds.
but
i
think
the
court
has
to
remember
in
this
case
that
religion
is
something
like
beauty.
beauty
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
beholder.
i
think
that
religion
is
the
same
thing.
i
think
religion
also
has
to
be
in
the
eyes
of
the
believer.
religion
means
different
things
to
different
people.
to
some
people,
it
may
seam
go
to
church
on
sunday,
or
the
sabbath.
perhaps
it
has
a
social
connotation
to
other
people.
but
to
some
people
the
basic
and
the
underlying
principle
of
religion
is
the
salvation
of
one's
soul.
that
basically
is
what
the
amish
people
are
about.
it
is
pretty
hard,
really,
to
describe
the
amish
people
without
living
with
them,
without
going
to
see
them,
visiting
their
homes,
talking
to
them,
and
i
think
by
doing
that
you
perhaps
gain
an
insight
into
what
the
amish
people
are
about.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that
is
very
applicable
here,
too,
because
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
what
the
government
has
said,
that
it
is
really
a
sin,
they
admit
that
it
is
a
sin
on
behalf
of
the
amish
people
to
pay
into
the
system,
but
then
what
they
go
on
to
do
is
to
say,
well,
that
is
not
that
great
of
a
sin.
the
amish
people,
pure
and
simple,
live
by
the
book
of
timothy.
the
book
of
timothy,
of
course,
paraphrased,
says,
if
you
don't
take
care
of
your
own
neighbors,
you
are
worse
than
an
infidel.
that
is
the
basic
underlying
principle
of
this
particular
case.
that
is
the
belief
of
the
amish
people.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
that
is
true,
but
there
are
exceptions
to
that.
as
an
example,
federal
employees
are
not
part
of
the
social
security
system.
they
have
their
own
system
to
take
care
of
themselves.
the
amish
have
their
own
system,
which
is
the
best
system
i
have
ever
seen.
they
take
care
of
their
own.
if
they
have
tragedy,
they
are
there
to
take
care
of
them.
about
two
weeks
ago--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--no,
all
of
the
employees
of
mr.
lee
were
members
of
the
old
order
amish.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
no,
it
does
not,
but
there
were
no...
i
think
that
it
does.
i
think
the
stipulation
states
that
all
of
the
employees
were
members
of
the
old
order
amish.
mr.
lee
did
not
employ
anybody
who
was
not
a
member
of
his
own
sect.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
will
not...
right.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
would
continue
to
take
care
of
their
own.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
no,
but
i
think
it
burdens
their
religious
belief.
i
think
that
is
the
issue.
again,
they
do
consider
it
a
very
serious
sin
to
pay
into
the
system,
because
what
they
are
doing
is
denying
their
faith
in
the
destiny
of
god.
they
believe
very
frankly
in
the
destiny
of
god,
that
god
will--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--yes.
i
think...
i
feel
very
strongly
about
that.
i
think
that
once
a
particular
group
of
individuals
such
as
the
amish
establish
the
fact
that
certain
conduct
is
sinful,
and
that
opinion
is
a
sincere
opinion
such
as
the
amish
people
have,
i
don't
think
this
court
or
the
government
or
anybody
else
can
question
the
sincerity
of
that
belief,
and
attach
a
sin
to
it
as
being
mortal
or
venal
in
nature.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
weren't
questioning
the
sincerity
of
the
belief,
but
they
are
saying
the
sin
would
simply
be
an
incidental
sin.
it
wouldn't
be
that
great.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
think
i
do
need
to
distinguish
that,
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
compelling
state
interest.
i
think
the
compelling
state
interest
in
those
instances
was
such
different
than
the
compelling
state
interest
here.
the
government
has
said
that
the
compelling
state
interest
is
the
broad
participation
of
individuals
in
the
social
security
laws.
i
don't
think
that...
that
is
what
the
compelling
state
interest
as
far
as--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--very
definitely
i
do.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes.
i
think
very
definitely.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
i
do.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
think
the
federal
income
tax
is
different.
i
think
that
the
argument
has
been
made--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--yes.
again,
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
again
between
social
security
and
the
federal
income
tax.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
the
amish
people
pay
all
taxes.
they
pay
income
taxes,
they
pay
all
property
taxes,
they
pay
every
tax
you
and
i
pay.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
no.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
think
that
is,
of
course,
a
different
case
than
we
have
here,
but
i
think
that...
again,
i
think
they
would
have
to
take
the
position
that
it
would
still
be
a
sin.
i
think
if
that
happens,
i
think
you
have
the
compelling
state
interest
shifting.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
i
am.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
that's
true.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
it
can
be.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
because
i
think
again,
we
have
to
again,
i
think,
look
at
the
compelling
state
interest.
i
think
that
the
crises
such
as
you
have
cited,
if
they
were
permissible
under
the
laws
of
our
country,
i
think
it
could
lead
to
chaos.
i
don't
think
that
is
true
as
far
as
the
amish
people
are
concerned,
when
you
consider
the
social
security
tax
and
the
number
of
amish
people
that
you
have
in
this
country.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
well,
maybe
i
shouldn't
use
the
word
"chaos",
but
what
i--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--no,
i
don't
think
it
would
cause
chaos,
and
i
would
like
to
back
up
on
that
statement,
but
i
think
that...
certainly
i
think
that
the
result
of
the
practice
of
polygamy
in
this
country
would
be
much
different
than
the
law
not
requiring
the
amish
people
to
pay
into
the
social
security
system.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
never...
they
do
not
participate
in
the
benefits.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
may
leave
the
sect--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--yes,
there
are,
very
definitely.
there
are
people
that
leave
the
faith.
but
i
think
when
you
read
mr.
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
in
the
yoder
case,
he
alludes
very
clearly
to
the
fact
that
the
amish
children
in
the
yoder
case
had
to
he
protected,
that
if
they
went
to
school
beyond
the
eighth
grade
in
that
particular
case,
that
they
would
be
taught
the
ways
of
the
world,
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
here
as
far
as...
the
same
reasoning
applies
as
far
as
the
social
security
is
concerned.
if
you
make
social
security
payments
eligible,
if
you
make
the
amish
people
eligible
to
receive
social
security,
that
is
there
for
them
to
receive,
they
may
receive
it
and
then
deny
their
faith.
that
is
what
some
of
the
older
amish
people
are
concerned
about,
and
i
think
rightly
so.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
i
would
think
so,
and
i
think
that
same
reasoning
applies
in
the
yoder
case,
as
far
as
the
temptation
of
students
going
to
school
beyond
the
eighth
grade,
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
parents
in
yoder
were
concerned
about,
and
that
is
what
the
amish
employers
are
concerned
about--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--i
don't
think
that
is
a
concern.
if
another
religion--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--if
another
religion
such
as
the
amish
popped
up,
i
think
the
same
reasoning
would
apply.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
think
that
the
amish
people
date
back--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--well,
i--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--yes,
they
would
date
back,
and
that
same
reasoning
could
apply.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
just
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--i
can't
see
where
that
is
a
reality
in
this
particular
case,
because
i
don't
think--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--because
i
think
that
the
amish
people
predate
back
to
the
16th
century
in
switzerland.
they
came
to
this
country
for
religious
freedom.
they
have
established
this
history
from
the
16th
century.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
that
the
amish
people
can
predate
their
history
back
to
the
16th
century.
if
there
is
another
religious
faith--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--no,
i
am
not.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
that's
true.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes.
i
think
again
if
we
are
going
back
to
the
compelling
state
interest,
i
think
that
is
what
is
important
here.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
compelling
state
interest,
and
you
have
to,
i
think,
ask
your
question
whether
or
not
the
state
interest
is
justified.
in
my
opinion,
it
is
not
justified
in
this
particular
case
when
we
look
at
the
amish
payment
into
the
social
security
system.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
system
is.
i
think
this
is
where
the
compelling
state
interest
comes
into
play.
the
amish
people
take
care
of
themselves.
i
think
the
compelling
state
interest
is
whether
or
not
the
amish
people
as
a
group
have
the
means
to
care
for
themselves.
they
have
taken
care
of
that
compelling
state
interest
themselves.
i
think
that
is
what
is
important.
they
do
have
a
system
whereby
they
take
care
of
their
older
people,
they
take
care
of
their
younger
people,
their
sick
people.
they
do
it
themselves.
that
is
the
compelling
state
interest,
i
think.
can
they
take
care
of
the
situation
themselves?
they
have
done
that
since
the
16th
century.
they
have
their
own
social
security
system.
the
compelling
state
interest
is,
in
my
mind,
anyway,
as
far
as
the
social
security
act
is
concerned,
is
to
take
care
of
older
people,
aged
people,
people
that
are
disabled.
they
do
that
themselves.
they
have
taken
care
of
the
compelling
state
interest
themselves
with
their
own
actions
and
by
their
own
beliefs
based
upon
their
belief
in
god
and
the
destiny
of
god.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
do.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
would
think
that
it
would
be,
because
i
think
that
what
they
are
doing
by
paying
into
the
system
is
denying
their
belief
in
the
destiny
of
god.
that
is
what
is
important.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
don't
really
take
care
of
each
other,
though,
by
the
use
of
moneys.
what
they
do
is,
they
take
care
of
each
other
by
the
use
of
their
physical
labor.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
they
definitely
do.
of
course
need
money,
like
anybody
else,
an
order
to
subsist,
but
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
the
important
situation
is
the
fact
that
when
they
do
pay
into
the
system,
what
they
are
doing
is
denying
their
belief
that
their
future
is
guided
by
the
destiny
of
god.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
if
the
employee
of
mr.
lee
was
not
amish?
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
all
right.
the
employer,
of
course,
has
his
half
to
pay
and
the
employee
has
his
half
to
pay.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
think
it
would
be
a
sin
to
pay
the
employer's
half.
it
would
not
be
a
sin
to
pay
the
employee's
half.
as
a
matter
of
practicality,
the
amish
people
just
employ
old
amish.
they
are
a
very
close-knit
community.
they--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--yes,
it
would.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
of
course,
there
is
a
lot
of
tension
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
i
think
when
you
consider
the
number
of
amish
people
there
are
in
this
country,
i
think
when
you
consider
their
general
practices
of
amish
people
working
together
and
not
employing
members
who
are
not
members
of
the
old
order
amish,
i
don't
think
you
really
run
into
that
question.
if
the
situation
did
arise
whereby
an
amishman
did
hire
an
individual
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
amish
faith,
yes,
you
would
have
a
problem,
but
as
a
matter
of
practicality,
that
just
does
not
come
up
because
they
are
a
very
close
community.
they
stay
within
their
own
bounds.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
if
you
would
tax
the
wine
that
they
use?
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
really
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
question.
i
would
say
that,
yes,
were
taxes
that
was
placed
upon
the
wine
that,
let's
say,
was
used
at
a
catholic
mass.
i
would
not
know
the
reason
for
legislation
such
as
that,
but
i
think
that
you
could
run
into
the
same
problem
if
there
were
taxes
placed
upon
the
wine.
perhaps
the
problem
becomes
more
paramount
if
the
catholic
priest
couldn't
buy
the
wine
because
of
the
tax.
i
think
you
would
run
into
a
problem
there.
but
if
he
could
still
purchase
the
wine,
i
can
see
nothing
wrong
with
that.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
which
it
is,
at
least
where
i
come
from.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
certainly
they
would
have
the
same
right
to
present
their
case.
i
haven't
really
thought
about
that
in
great
detail.
i
would
have
to
give
you
a
quick
answer.
i
would
say
yes,
they
would
have
that
right.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
to
present
their
case.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
would
hate
to
comment
myself
on
what
direction
i
would
go
in,
but
i
would
certainly
think
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
present
that
issue,
but
again
i
think
we
get
back
to
the
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes,
sir.
i
realize
that
probably
the
greatest
problem
with
this
case
is
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
taxes.
of
course,
social
security,
i
feel,
in
my
mind,
is
more
of
an
insurance
than
a
tax.
of
course,
the
name
of
the
act
is
the
federal
insurance
contribution
act.
it
is
set
up
in
a
trust
fund,
and
i
think
that
the
moneys
are
distributed
basically
the
same
way
that
insurance
carriers
distribute
annuity
funds.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--of
course,
that
does
present
problems,
but
i
think
that
again--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
would
say,
yes,
in
my
opinion,
it
is.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
i
don't
really
think
so.
i
think
if
social
security
was
financed
out
of
general
revenues,
i
think
your
compelling
state
interest
would
be
different.
social
security
funds
are
set
aside.
many
of
the
amish
people
are
against
many
social
welfare
programs
that
are
really
financed
by
general
revenues
which
come
from
income
tax
which
they
pay,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
fair
or
proper
to
place
on
the
government
the
responsibility
to
distinguish
where
everybody's
tax
dollar
goes
on
a
dollar
by
dollar
basis.
that
is
not
true
as
far
as
the
social
security
act
is
concerned.
the
money
goes
into
the
system
and
is
paid
out
of
the
system.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
yes.
i
think...
i
think
that
it
would
also
be...
it
also
could
be
a
sin,
but
i
think
again--
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
--it
would
be
a
sin,
but
i
think
you
get
back
again
to
the
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
francis
x.
caiazza
it
would
override
it.
that
is
my
position.
i
forgot
where
i
was.
