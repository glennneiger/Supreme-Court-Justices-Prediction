mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
a
member
of
the
old
order
amish
religious
sect
who
employed
other
members
of
that
sect
on
his
farm
and
in
his
carpentry
shop
during
the
taxable
years
involved,
1970
through
1977.
he
did
not
withhold
social
security
taxes
from
their
wages
or
pay
the
employer's
share
of
those
taxes,
and
after
an
internal
revenue
service
assessment
in
1978,
he
paid
the
taxes
for
one
quarter
of
one
year
for
an
employee,
and
brought
this
suit
for
a
refund,
claiming
that
the
tax
as
applied
violated
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
the
basis
for
this
claim
is
the
belief
of
the
old
amish
sect
to
which
he
adhered
that
the
members
are
to
care
for
their
aged,
their
sick,
and
their
unemployed,
and
do
not
need
any
form
of
social
welfare
benefits
from
outside
their
religious
community,
and
that
it
is
a
sin
either
to
accept
social
security
benefits
or
to
pay
the
social
security
taxes.
the
district
court
upheld
his
claim
that
the
tax
was
unconstitutional
as
applied,
and
the
united
states
appealed
to
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
ordinary
enforcement
procedures
to
collect
the
taxes
would
be
utilized,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
of
course
this
case
has
been
litigated,
and
none
of
those
procedures
have
been
put
into
effect.
the
case
was
tried
on
a
stipulation,
and
counsel
have
agreed
that
the
amount
of
taxes
owing
will
be
agreed
upon
should
the
united
states
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
at
least
was
willing
to
make
the
payment.
i
can't
really
speak
for
whether
that
offended
his
religious
beliefs.
he
made
it
under
a
claim
of
right
to
a
refund,
and
perhaps
that
reconciled
it
with
his
belief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
is
still
claiming
the
right
to
a
refund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
are
not
asking--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
accept
that
holding,
that
that
is
his
religious
belief,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
ask
the
court
to
look
behind
that
religious
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
agree
with
quite
that
formulation,
justice
brennan.
we
don't
question
that
he
in
good
faith
and
with
sincerity
believes
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
pay
the
tax,
and
he
is
making--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
this
is
not
in
the
circumstances
of
a
generally
applicable
tax
protected
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are...
to
pay
a
tax
assessed
on
all
persons--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--for
an
economic
activity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
haven't
really
suggested
a
test
of
that
kind.
the
court
has
spoken
in
terms
of
a
balancing
test
in
the
pertinent
cases,
looking
toward
the
interest
claimed
under
the
free
exercise
clause
and
the
governmental
interest.
i
don't
know
that
it
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
formulate
it
in
an
abstract
way
other
than
to
use
what
the
court
has
used,
that
you
examine
the
claim
that
is
made
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
and
the
nature
of
the
government's
interest,
and
make
a
determination.
this
claim
is
quite
different
from
many
others
that
have
been
before
the
court,
and
we
have
tried
to
describe
some
of
those
differences
in
our
brief.
i
don't
really
think
that
the
case
can
be
answered
with
an
abstract
standard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
did
provide
an
exemption
from
the
self-employment
tax,
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief,
but
it
was
very
careful
in
providing
that
exemption
to
limit
it
only
to
the
self-employment
tax,
and
the
committee
report
specifies
that
the
committee
did
not
want
to
go
beyond
that
and
compromise
the
principle
that
social
security
contributions
are
not
to
be
a
voluntary
matter
beyond
that
narrow
area.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
claim
does
embrace
the
employees'
share
of
the
tax
as
well
as
the
employer's
share.
under
the
social
security
laws,
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
are
responsible
for
part
of
the
tax,
although
as
it
happens
in
this
case,
since
he
did
not
withhold
anything
from
the
wages
of
the
employees,
he
himself
was
responsible
for
the
entire
tax.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
to
pay
whether
he
withholds
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
not
think
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although
there
is
admittedly
some
tension
with
it,
but
we
think
it
is
a
permissible
accommodation
of
values,
of
religious
values
that
the
government
can
make
under
a
number
of
this
court's
cases
that
do
permit
some
area
of
legislative
discretion
in
accommodating
religious
beliefs
with
the
general
requirements
of
the
law,
and
indeed,
we
think
that
the
exemption
could
be
extended
to
the
employment
taxes
if
congress
saw
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
employment
relationship
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
employment
relationship.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
still
applicable
to
his
own
self-employment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
though
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
wages
that
he
pays
to
his
employee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
stipulation
so
states,
although
it
doesn't
say
how
many
there
are.
the
record
just
doesn't
show
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
there
would
be
less
basis
for
the
claim
that
there
was
a
right
to
exclude
them
under
the
free
exercise
clause
from
social
security
coverage.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i
am
aware--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
record
does
not
show
this.
the
committee
report
which
congress
issued
and
that
it
enacted
the
exemption
for
self-employment
in
1965
did
emphasize
that
the
proposed
exemption
in
their
belief
must
be
on
the
basis
of
individual
choice
to
exclude
all
members
of
a
religious
group
from
social
security
coverage
would
not
take
account
of
the
variances
in
individual
beliefs
within
any
religious
groups,
and
would
deny
social
security
protection
to
those
individuals
who
want
it.
among
the
old
older
amish,
for
example,
there
have
been
some
indications
of
a
change
in
attitude
towards
social
security,
particularly
among
the
younger
people.
some
members
of
the
old
order
amish
who
have
become
eligible
for
social
security
benefits
have
claimed
the
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
number
213.
however,
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
indicates
anything
of
this
kind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
discuss
those
cases
in
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
involved
much
more
serious
problems
for
the
claimant
of
the
free
exercise
right,
choosing
between,
in
the
sherbert
case,
observance
of
one's
sabbath
or
one's
economic
livelihood,
and
in
the
thomas
case
something
very
comparable,
because
of
the
loss
of
employment
that
was
involved
there,
in
order
not
to
perform
something
that
one
believed
could
not
be
performed.
here,
the
amish,
who
do
not
want
to
be
within
the
social
security
program,
of
course,
do
not
have
to
accept
benefits,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
they
believe
that
the
furnishing
of
benefits
to
others
in
the
national
community
who
are
covered
by
the
program
is
in
any
way
in
conflict
with
their
beliefs.
their
claim
really
is
that
there
is,
as
they
see
it,
an
implication
in
their
paying
the
tax
that
somehow
they
will
become
eligible
for
the
benefits,
and
that
indicates
the
sin
of
not
planning
to
take
care
of
their
own
community.
but
that
is,
with
all
respect
to
their
belief,
a
construction
that
they
choose
to
put
on
the
payment.
so
far
as
congress
is
concerned,
this
is
just
a
generally
applicable
tax
on
a
commercial
relationship,
and
the
employment
relationship
for
engaging
in
commercial
activity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
the
thomas
case,
he
was
performing
work
that
was
contrary
to
his
religious
belief,
and
by
denying
him
unemployment
compensation
rights
for
giving
up
the
job
for
that
reason,
there
would
be
economic
pressure
on
him
to
engage
in
work
that
is
contrary
to
his
religion.
i
realize--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
the
essence
of
the
distinction
that
we
make.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
all
religious
beliefs
as
beliefs
stand
on
the
same
footing
under
the
constitution.
a
religious
group
might
believe
that
it
is
a
sin
to
pay
any
tax
to
secular
authority,
and
that
as
a
belief
would
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
the
interpretation
of
social
security
tax
payments
that
this
group
chooses
to
put
on
those
payments,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
act
on
those
beliefs
and
to
refuse
to
pay
the
taxes
that
are
levied
on
non-religious
grounds
generally
in
the
community
on
the
basis
of
commercial
activities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
nothing
in
the
law,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
prevent
a
member
of
the
amish
faith
who
is
eligible
to
receive
social
security
payments
from
receiving
those
payments
and
paying
them
over
to
a
general
fund
in
the
community
to
care
for
members
of
the
community.
there
may
be
an
impediment
to
doing
that
in
his
religious
faith,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
that
requires
him
to
receive
the
benefits
at
all
if
he
chooses
not
to
receive
the
benefits.
this
is
a
right
protected
by
the
free
enterprise
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
really,
as
we
view
the
case,
start
from
the
standpoint
that
we
need
to
show
a
compelling
interest,
but
however
one
characterizes
that,
the
interest
is
really
one
set
forth
in
one
of
the
classic
opinions
of
justice
stone,
writing
for
this
court
in
one
of
the
cases
in
volume
301
of
the
u.
s.
reports
that
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
social
security
act
itself,
and
that
established
that
the
payments
as
congress
characterized
them
are
taxes,
and
not
insurance
premiums,
as
is
sometimes
confused,
and
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
the
key
paragraph
of
that
opinion,
and
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
turn
our
attention
to
it,
because
it
seems
to
me
to
go
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
we
don't
really
feel
that
the
tax,
that
congress's
power
to
tax
need
be
justified
in
terms
of
whether
the
amish
will
be
withdrawing
benefits
from
the
fund,
the
general
fund
that
is
collected,
a
tax
as
at
that
time
mr.
justice
stone
said
for
the
court,
"is
not
an
assessment
of
benefits.
"
"it
is
a
means
of
distributing
the
burden
of
the
cost
of
government.
"
"the
only
benefit
to
which
a
taxpayer
is
constitutionally
entitled
is
that
derived
from
his
enjoyment
of
the
privileges
of
living
in
an
organized
society,
established
and
safeguarded
by
the
devotion
of
taxes
to
public
purposes.
"
"any
other
view
would
preclude
the
levying
of
taxes
except
as
they
are
used
to
compensate
for
the
burden
on
those
who
pay
them,
and
would
involve
the
abandonment
of
the
most
fundamental
principle
of
government,
that
it
exists
primarily
to
provide
for
the
common
good.
"
there
are
many
contributions
made
in
the
community
at
large
that
contribute
toward
the
maintenance
of
the
way
of
life
that
the
amish
have
fashioned,
and
that
under
wisconsin
against
yoder
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
maintain
as
they
choose
to
fashion
it,
but
the
fact
is,
it
is
not
only
through
their
efforts
that
that
way
of
life
can
be
maintained.
there
are
others
in
the
community
in
general
who
are
willing,
for
example,
to
train
themselves
in
the
advanced
technology
that
is
needed
to
defend
the
country
in
today's
world,
and
to
protect
the
constitutional
form
of
government
which
provides
for
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
and
others
who
are
willing
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces,
et
cetera.
the
fact
that
the
free
exercise
clause
confers
upon
a
community
such
as
the
amish
the
right
to
maintain
the
way
of
life
that
they
choose
to
fashion
for
their
community
does
not
negate
the
obligations
they
have
to
the
larger
community,
including
the
obligation
to
pay
generally
applicable
taxes
on
commercial
activities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
realize
that
in
your
view,
justice
rehnquist,
it
probably
doesn't.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
burden
involved
in
thomas,
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
was
of
greater
magnitude,
and
here,
there
is
nothing
in
the
payment
of
taxes
that
prevents
the
amish
from
maintaining
their
system
of
providing
for
the
social
welfare
of
the
members
of
their
own
community
through
their
own
efforts,
which
is
their
basic
religious
teaching,
even
though
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
those
more
recent
cases
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
in
1970
is
a
case
in
which
we
have
set
out
a
quotation
in
our
reply
brief,
on
page
3,
called
autenrieth
v.
cullen.
in
that
case
a
large
number
of
people
with
very
serious,
they
claimed,
conscientious
scruples
against
the
activities
that
the
government
was
engaged
in
in
vietnam
wished
not
to
pay
the
share
of
their
income
taxes
that
would
be
attributed
to
supporting
that
activity,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
that
claim,
and
we
have
quoted
a
passage
of
its
opinion,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
there
are
other
cases
collected
in
our
principal
brief.
in
a
way,
this
is
a
more
serious
claim
of
conscience
than
we
are
involved
in
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
mean
in
any
way
not
to
respect
the
claim
that
is
being
made
here,
but
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
religious
views
of
the
amish
are
offended
by
the
use
to
which
these
moneys
will
actually
be
put,
to
take
care
of
the
social
welfare
problems
of
other
persons
in
the
general
community,
whereas
in
many
of
these
other
cases
in
which
people
have
claimed
a
conscientious
scruple
against
paying
taxes,
they
found
it
contrary
to
their
conscience
to
have
the
money
spent
the
government
was
planning
to
spend
the
money.
here,
the
money
need
not
be
spent
in
a
way
that
would
offend
their
religious
beliefs,
but
it
is
the
payment
of
the
tax
itself
which
they
construe
to
be
a
sin.
now,
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
while
the
social
security
laws
do
use
the
word
"insurance"
and
use
a
trust
fund
concept,
the
payments
that
are
involved
here
have
from
the
beginning
been
recognized
to
be
taxes
and
not
insurance
premiums,
as
they
are
sometimes
loosely
called.
this
may
be
very
obvious
on
the
facts
of
this
case
in
which
the
payments

there
can
be
some
confusion
about
this.

of

refers
to
this
as
the
payment

any
possible
doubt
on
this
subject
was
dispelled
by
a
decision
of
this
court
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
which
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,

i
called
it

attention,

which
made
it

of
our

which
shows
that
we
long
since
have
reached
the
point
that
mr.
justice
brennan
posed
in
a
question
where
federal
funds
out
of
the
general
revenues
are
being
used
for
social
welfare
programs,
such
as
the
aid

but
also
they
are
being
used
for
a
supplemental
program
within
the
social

act

that
we
have
documented
there.
other
than
that,
we
will
rest
on
our
brief,
unless
there
are
further
questions.
