mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
on
appeals
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire.
the
key
issues
are
whether
new
hampshire's
restriction
on
hydroelectric
exports
places
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
whether
the
restriction
is
pre
empted
by
the
federal
power
act.
the
facts
are
straightforward.
new
england
power
company
is
part
of
a
holding
company
system
that
serves
customers
in
rhode
island,
massachusetts,
and
new
hampshire.
it
owns
several
hydroelectric
units
along
the
connecticut
river
located
in
new
hampshire.
energy
from
these
units
is
delivered
to
an
integrated
regional
transmission
grid
and
flows
freely
in
interstate
commerce.
in
1980,
the
new
hampshire
public
utilities
commission
invoked
a
1913
state
statute
and
ordered
new
england
power
company
to
sell
within
new
hampshire
the
output
from
the
units.
the
commission
did
not
order
nep
to
interrupt
physically
the
way
the
power
is
being
generated
or
transmitted.
rather,
it
sought
to
capture
exclusively
for
the
benefit
of
new
hampshire
citizens
the
economic
benefits
of
these
units.
new
hampshire's
attempt
to
retain
the
economic
benefits
of
an
important
natural
resource
exclusively
for
its
own
citizens
violates
the
commerce
clause.
there
are
two
mainstream
cases
by
this
court
which
are
directly
on
point.
west
versus
kansas
natural
gas
company
involved
a
state
prohibition
against
the
export
of
natural
gas.
and
in
a
case
even
more
on
point,
in
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia,
this
court
struck
down
a
statute
that
required
natural
gas
companies
to
serve
local
needs
first,
before
exporting
any
natural
gas.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
our
commerce
clause
argument
is
based
on
the
commerce
clause
itself.
in
addition
to
that
we
have
a
pre
emption
argument
that
the
new
hampshire
restriction
is
pre
empted
by
the
federal
power
act.
now,
new
hampshire
seeks
to
rebut
our
commerce
clause
argument
by
relying
on
section
201(b)
of
the
federal
power
act,
so
the
federal
power
act
is
involved
in
our
commerce
clause
argument
to
that
extent.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
that
clause.
new
hampshire's
argument
is
that
that
is
an
affirmative
grant
of
authority,
and
therefore
congress
affirmatively
authorized
them
to
burden
interstate
commerce.
mr.
samuel
huntington
section
201(b)
of
the
federal
power
act.
let
me
turn
immediately
to
the
language
of
that
section,
which
i
think
itself
is
dispositive.
201(b)
provides,
"the
provisions
of
part
2
of
the--
"
mr.
samuel
huntington
--this
is
at
page
19
of
our
brief.
mr.
samuel
huntington
"the
provisions
of
part
2
shall
not
deprive
a
state
or
a
state
commission
of
its
lawful
authority
now
exercised
over
the
exportation
of
hydroelectric
energy
which
is
transmitted
across
a
state
line.
"
the
question
is,
is
this
a
grant,
and
we
submit
that
the
words
"shall
not
deprive"
are
flatly
inconsistent
with
a
grant.
these
are
not
words
of
grant.
"lawful
authority
now
exercised"
is
certainly
not
a
reference
to
new
authority
heretofore
barred
by
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
samuel
huntington
congressman
rodgers
may
have
thought
that
the
state
had
lawful
authority
to
restrict
hydroelectric
exports.
what
congressman
rodgers
said
is,
allow
us
to
continue
to
exercise
these
rights
which
we
have.
congress's
reaction
to
that
was
to
enact
201(b),
which
is
a
savings
clause.
congress
said,
all
right,
whatever
lawful
authority
you
now
have
you
can
continue
to
exercise,
no
more,
no
less.
the
context
of
section
201(b)
is
also
flatly
inconsistent
with
reading
that--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--it
saved
whatever
authority
new
hampshire
had.
now,
we
don't
think
the
court
needs--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--well,
in
fact,
it
may
have
saved
nothing.
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue,
because
i
think
there
may
be
a
category
of
cases
where
the
court
could
restrict
hydroelectric
exports
in
order
to
meet
a
local
emergency
or
need,
and
we
do
address
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
there
is
another
provision--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--there
is
another
provision
in
section
201(b)
that
says
that
the
authority
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
extends
to
wholesale
sales,
but
to
no
other
sales,
and
that
would
take
care
of
the
retail
sales.
i
think
the
context
of
section
201(b)
is
important
here.
part
2
of
the
federal
power
act
was
passed
following
the
attleboro
decision,
which
held
squarely
that
interstate
flows
of
electricity
are
subject
to
the
protection
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
regulating
wholesale
sales
in
interstate
commerce
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
states.
now,
congress's
reaction
to
that
decision
was
not
to
create
new
authority,
not
to
delegate
to
the
authority
affirmative...
to
the
states
affirmative
power
to
regulate
wholesale
sales.
congress's
power
was...
congress's
reaction
was
to
observe
federal
state
constitutional
lines
to
give
the
federal
power
commission,
as
it
was
then
called,
authority
over
wholesale
rates
and
to
preserve
to
the
states
whatever
authority
they
had,
and
we
submit
that
section
201(b)
is
completely
consistent
with
this
division.
there
is
another
section--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--attleboro
was
in
1927,
so
it
was
seven
or
eight
years.
but
the
legislative
history
of
the
part
2
makes
clear
that
they
were
reacting
to
the
attleboro
decision
and
that
part
2
was
enacted
specifically
to
fill
the
so
called
attleboro
gap.
there
is
another
section--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--no,
we
are
arguing
first
that
it
is
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
samuel
huntington
because
we
think
the
restriction
falls
squarely
within
this
court's
commerce
clause
decisions
and
must
fall.
we
think
that
is
the
easiest
ground
to
rest
the
decision.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
201(b)
is
relevant--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
huntington
without
201(b)
we
wouldn't
be
in
court.
it
would
be
clear
that
there
was
no...
that
we
had
a
solid
case.
i
don't
think
new
hampshire
would
have
a
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
if
you
construe
201(b)
as
an
affirmative
grant,
which
we
think
would
be--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--that
is
right.
you
could
then--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--the
case
presents
squarely
a
commerce
clause
issue
and
two
pre
emption--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--if
201(b)...
201(b)
has
to
be
looked
at
in
two
senses.
first,
does
it
save
from
pre
emption
the
new
hampshire
restriction?
mr.
samuel
huntington
no.
no,
no.
201(b),
if
it
is
a
traditional
savings
clause,
as
we
assert
it
is,
then
it
could
save
the
new
hampshire
restriction
from
pre
emption
under
part
2.
however,
the
statute
could
still
be
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause
unless
201(b)
is
an
affirmative
grant.
now,
this
is
the
approach
the
court
used
last
term
in
the
bt
investment
managers
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
question,
the
court
must
construe
section
201(b),
and
our
contention
is
that
the
first
question
the
court
must
address
is,
is
it
an
affirmative
grant
or
is
it
a
savings
clause.
if
it
is
a
savings
clause,
then
it
is
not
a
defense
to
our
commerce
clause
challenge.
it
is
only
a
defense
to
our
pre
emption
argument,
and
that
is
the
approach
that
the
court
used
in
the
bt
investment
managers
case
last
year,
which
involved
a
savings
clause
practically
identical
to
the
201(b)
savings
clause
here.
the
court
there
held
that
the
saving...
that
it
was
a
savings
clause,
and
it
protected
the
florida
statute
there
in
question
from
pre
emption,
but
it
was
not
an
affirmative
grant,
and
the
florida
statute
was
struck
down
on
commerce
clause
grounds.
let
me
refer
the
court
to
section
202(f)
of
the
federal
power
act,
which
was
not
mentioned
in
our
briefs,
but
i
think
it
is
relevant
here,
and
i
brought
it
to
mr.
smith's
attention.
202(f),
part
2,
was
enacted
in
1953
to
make
clear
that
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction
did
not
extend
to
international
sales,
wholesale
sales
between
a
single
state
and
a
foreign
country.
congress
in
enacting
202(f)
was
concerned
that
these
sales
might
then
be
beyond
either
federal
or
state
authority
under
the
attleboro
decision.
so
in
202(f)
congress
added
a
provision
that
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
states
may
regulate
any
such
transaction.
"
and
the
legislative
history
of
202(f),
which
is
house
report
number
978,
83rd
congress,
first
session,
makes
clear
that
congress
added
that
because
they
were
concerned
that
the
states
might
not
have
that
authority
under
the
attleboro
gap...
under
the
attleboro
decision.
so
202(f)
is
an
example
of
a
clear
delegation
to
the
states
of
authority
to
regulate
wholesale
sales.
the
states
may
regulate
any
such
transaction.
that
stands
in
total
contrast
to
201(b),
which
says
that
nothing
shall
deprive
a
state
of
any
lawful
authority
now
exercised.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
new
hampshires
second
argument
to
avoid
the
commerce
clause
contention
we
make.
and
that
is
that
the
state
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
river
itself,
and
that
justifies
this
restriction
on
interstate
commerce.
even
if
the
state
has
a
proprietary
interest,
and
we
submit
it
does
not,
that
interest
does
not
justify
restricting
commerce
in
a
product
which
is
privately
manufactured
using
the
river's
power.
electricity
is
a
product
generated
by
new
england
power
company
using
the
river's
power.
by
way
of
analogy,
flour
is
a
product
that
can
be
milled
using
the
river's
power.
clearly,
new
hampshire
does
not
have
the
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
to
restrict
commerce
in
flour.
we
submit
it
does
not
have
any
authority
to
restrict
commerce
in
a
privately
produced
product
such
as
electricity.
this
is
the
clear
teaching
of
foster
packing,
a
1928
decision
that
says
a
state
may
not
prevent
privately
owned
articles
of
trade
from
being
sold
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
rely
on
attleboro
for
the
proposition
that
electricity
in
interstate
commerce
is
subject
to
the
protection
of
the
commerce
clause.
attleboro
stands
for
the
proposition
that
wholesale
sales
in
interstate
commerce
are
beyond
the
authority
of
the
states
to
regulate.
i
think
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
whether
all
wholesale
sales
in
interstate
commerce
are
beyond
the
constitutional
authority.
however,
the
restriction
we
have
here
is
very
akin
to
the
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia
decision,
and
that
case
has
been
reaffirmed
time
and
time
again,
as
recently
as
last
year
in
the
bt
investment
case,
in
the
philadelphia
against
new
jersey
landfill
case,
and
stands
for
the
very
solid
proposition
that
a
state
cannot
erect
a
barrier
to
the
interstate
commerce
of
a
product
generated
from
a
natural
resource.
we
submit
in
any
event
that
new
hampshire
does
not
have
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
river
in
the
same
way
that
it
owns,
say,
state
forest
lands
or
the
state
capitol
building.
the
interest
new
hampshire
does
have
is
a
regulatory
interest.
it
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
resource
is
not
wasted,
it
is
conserved,
and
so
on.
but
this
court's
decision
in
hughes
against
oklahoma,
striking
down
a
state
barrier
on
the
export
of
minnows,
stands
firmly
for
the
proposition
that
this
ownership
interest
in
natural
resources,
wildlife,
and
so
on,
does
not
protect
the
state
regulation
from
commerce
clause
scrutiny.
the
ownership
interest
is
simply
the
equivalent
of
saying,
yes,
the
state
may
regulate
for
valid
conservation
or
waste
purposes,
but
those
regulations
must
still
pass
muster
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
submit
that
under
the
core
commerce
clause
decisions
of
this
court,
the
new
hampshire
restriction
cannot
survive
the
commerce
clause
attack.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
attorney
general
stated
that
it
is
not
significant
whether
the
section
201(b)
savings
clause
is
a
grant
or
a
savings
clause.
we
differ
there.
we
say
that
is
very
significant,
and
that
is
the
square
holding
of
bt
investment
managers
just
last
term.
when
presented
with
a
clause
such
as
this,
the
court
must
ask
two
questions.
first,
does
the
clause
interdict
pre
emption?
we
say
clearly
it
does
to
some
extent,
and
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
exactly
to
what
extent
it
does
interdict
part
2
pre
emption.
the
second
question
is,
does
the
clause
go
beyond
interdicting
pre
emption
and
affirmatively
give
to
the
states
an
authority
to
regulate
commerce
that
the
states
did
not
previously
have.
in
bt
investment
managers,
the
court
found
that
savings
clause
did
not
do
that.
we
submit
that
this
savings
clause,
which
reads
virtually
identically
to
the
bank
holding
company
act
savings
clause
in
bt
investment
managers,
also
does
not
give
the
state
authority.
in
fact,
new
hampshire
concedes
in
their
brief
at
page
15
that
the
language
of
201(b)
is
not
that
usually
used
by
a
legislature
when
authorizing
an
act.
that,
we
submit,
is
an
understatement.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
am
afraid
i
don't
know.
basically
what
happened
here
is,
congress
finessed
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
new
hampshire
authority
referred
to
by
congressman
rodgers
was
or
was
not...
congress
finessed
it
by
saying,
whatever
authority
you
have
is
saved
from
part
2
pre
emption,
but
left
to
the
courts
to
determine
what
is
saved,
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
case
presents
for
the
first
time.
this
is
the
first
time
new
hampshire
has
imposed
a
restriction.
in
fact,
the
first
time
any
state
has
imposed
a
restriction--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--i
think
that
comes
to
the
question
in
volume
versus
rate
regulation
which
mr.
justice
stevens
raised.
i
was
interested
to
hear
mr.
smith
contend
now
that
all
new
hampshire
did
here
was
to
regulate
volume
and
not
rates.
new
hampshire
did
not
in
any
way
attempt
to
restrict
physically
the
amount
of
energy
flowing
out
of
state
from
these
units.
what
did
new
hampshire
do?
they
attempted
to
require
new
england
power
company
to
sell
this
power
within
new
hampshire,
an
economic
shift
through
adjustments
in
wholesale
contracts
and
tariffs.
that
is
wholesale
ratemaking,
and
that
is
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
ferc.
there
is
one
further
case
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief
which
i
think
is
pertinent
here,
and
that
is
the
california
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we
do.
and
we
argue
pre
emption
on
both
part
1
and
part
2
in
our
brief,
and
rely
on
our
discussion
there.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
california
case
involved
section
20
of
part
1.
section
20
of
part
1
recognized
or
at
least
referred
to
state
authority
over
wholesale
sales
from
hydroelectric
plants
that
are
licensed.
the
court
had
before
it,
does
the
state
have
any
lawful
authority
after
attleboro
over
sales
from
hydroelectric
licensed
units,
and
the
court
held,
no,
it
didn't.
congress
was
simply
wrong
when
they
assumed
in
enacting
section
20
that
the
states
had
some
authority.
we
think
we
have
a
parallel
situation
here.
whatever
congressman
rodgers
may
have
assumed,
in
fact,
new
hampshire
does
not
have
any
type
of
authority
under
the
commerce
clause.
that
is
what
lawful
authority
is,
and
that--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--it
is
certainly
a
valid
tool
as
far
as
pre
emption
is
concerned,
but
congress
did
not
pass
judgment
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
new
hampshire
authority,
and
that
is
why
they
said
lawful
authority
now
exercised,
leaving
it
for
further
determination
what
that
lawful
authority
is.
mr.
samuel
huntington
precisely.
thank
you.
