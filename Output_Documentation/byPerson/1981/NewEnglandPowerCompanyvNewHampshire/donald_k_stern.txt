mr.
donald
k.
stern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
also
contend
that
the
order
of
the
new
hampshire
public
utilities
commission
violates
the
commerce
clause
and
is
pre
empted
by
federal
statute.
we
agree
that
section
201(b)
does
not
act
as
a
grant
of
congressional
authority,
but
instead
should
be
construed
this
court
as
a
saving
clause.
for
purposes
of
my
argument,
however,
i
will
assume
a
contrary
interpretation
of
section
201(b),
and
will
assume
that
congress
did
in
fact
give
to
new
hampshire
the
authority
to
limit
or
ban
the
exportation
of
hydroelectric
power
and
that
the
puc's
order
fell
within
the
grant
of
that
authority.
such
an
interpretation
would,
in
our
view,
present
serious
constitutional
questions
centering
on
the
limits
of
congressional
authority.
mr.
donald
k.
stern
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
dispute
that
congress
can...
has
broad
discretion
and
authority
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause,
nor
do
we
dispute
that
congress's
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
exceeds
that
which
a
state
might
otherwise
have.
in
other
words,
this
case
is
not
a
case
where
we
argue
that
congress
was
incapable
of
giving
to
the
states
authority
which
it
wouldn't
have
had
in
absence
of
congressional
authority.
what
we
do
suggest
is
that
that
power
which
congress
has
and
which
the
states
willingly
gave
up
to
congress
when
it
entered
into
the
constitution
must
be
exercised
in
a
way
so
that
the
exercise
of
congressional
power
is
exercised
in
some
rational
manner
consistent
with
the
legitimate
ends
that
congress
sought
to
achieve.
now,
before
i
pursue
that
question,
your
honor,
i
want
to
briefly
describe
what
we
consider
massachusetts
and
rhode
island's
interest
in
this
litigation.
on
one
level,
of
course,
our
interest
is
as
narrow
as
is
new
hampshire's.
any
reduced
savings
to
new
hampshire
inevitably
means
that
we
pay
more.
mr.
donald
k.
stern
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
they
are
then
becoming
new
hampshire
residents
and
new
hampshire
citizens.
but
what
is
clear
is
that
the
fiscal
impact
of
the
puc's
order
by
its
very
terms
is
to
shift
the
economic
burden
of
some
$25
million.
our
estimates
exceed
that
amount,
but
we
are
willing
to
accept
that
at
a
minimum
$25
million
is
being
shifted
from
the
shoulders
of
new
hampshire
residents,
rather,
from
massachusetts
to
new
hampshire,
but
the
real
impact,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
and
this
is,
i
think,
perhaps
the
primary
reason
we
are
here,
exceeds
and
transcends
the
dollars
and
cents.
the
decision
of
the
puc
threatens
the
long
standing
cooperative
efforts
of
the
new
england
states
with
respect
to
energy
matters.
the
new
england
power
pool
represents
perhaps
this
nation's
most
sophisticated
and
highly
integrated
energy
power
pool
arrangement.
this
arrangement,
however,
is
a
finely
tuned
arrangement,
and
one
which,
as
the
commissioner
of
the
rhode
island
puc
testified
at
the
new
hampshire
hearing
suggested,
could
unravel
fairly
easily.
moreover,
the
puc's
order
invites
the
very
sort
of
economic
retaliation
and
isolation
which
these
same
three
states
were
subject
to
when
they
were
governed
by
the
articles
of
confederation,
which
leads
me
to
the
commerce
clause,
or
back
to
the
commerce
clause,
and
to
the
authority
which
the
states
willingly
gave
up
to
congress.
while
we
concede
that
this
authority
is
expansive,
there
are
certain
internal
and
external
constraints,
we
suggest,
on
congress's
power
to
legislate
in
the
area.
i
intend
to
focus
my
argument
on
the
internal
constraints
implicated
by
the
commerce
clause,
and
suggest
that
if
the
court
adopts
new
hampshire's
interpretation
of
section
201(b),
that
this
case
then
presents
one
of
those
rare
occasions
for
holding
that
congress
has
exceeded
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
in
prior
instances
where
the
court
has
been
faced
with
this
argument,
it
has
followed
essentially
a
two
step
analysis.
first,
whether
the
subject
matter
which
congress
acts
falls
within
the
broad
reach
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
here
there
is
no
dispute.
we
concede
that
congress
had
the
authority
to
regulate
in
the
energy
area
generally,
and
with
respect
to
hydroelectric
power
specifically.
in
fact,
it
forms
the
premise
of
our
own
commerce
clause
claim
and
our
pre
emption
claim.
but
the
second
step
and
the
second
question
is
contested
here,
and
that
is
whether
congress's
action
is
reasonably
related
to
the
goal
of
regulating
interstate
commerce.
this
question,
which
is
essentially
a
limited
means
and
ends
analysis,
requires
that
there
must
be
some
showing,
however
minimal,
that
congress
has
acted
in
a
rational
manner,
and
here,
it
is
our
position
that
whether
one
looks
for
an
articulated
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
or
indeed
for
any
plausible
reason
for
congress's
action,
none
emerge
to
support
a
grant
of
authority
to
new
hampshire
which
effectively
keeps
the
benefits,
the
economic
benefits
of
hydroelectric
power
within
her
borders
at
the
expense
of
her
sister
states.
the
fact
that
similar
authority
was
not
provided
to
the
vast
majority
of
other
states
underscores
the
irrationality
of
congress's
action.
mr.
donald
k.
stern
well,
we
suggest,
your
honor,
that
labeling
it
as
a
grandfather
clause
in
this
case
doesn't
assist
new
hampshire,
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is,
it
was
a
curious
kind
of
grandfather
clause,
because
new
hampshire
argues
that
it
didn't
simply
lock
in
lawful
authority.
part
of
its
argument
is
that
it
gave
to
a
few
states
authority
which
it
didn't
have
before
under
the
commerce
clause.
but
secondly,
we
suggest
that
calling
it
a
grandfather
clause
may
describe
what
congressman
rodgers
had
in
mind,
but
in
other
instances
where
the
court
has
upheld
the
rationality
of
grandfather
clauses
it
has
looked
to
see
whether
the
locking
in
of
the
inequity,
if
we
can
call
it
that,
furthers
some
other
rational,
some
other
legitimate
purpose
which
the
legislature
or
the
city
council
in
the
case
of
new
orleans
versus
duke
had
in
mind.
here,
of
course,
it
is
not
a
temporary
solution.
it
is
a...
to
a
national
problem.
what
it
does
is
to
give
to
new
hampshire
forever
power,
important
power,
within
its
borders,
this
economic
benefit,
yet
at
the
time
same
deny
to
the
rest
of
the
union,
and
here
specifically
massachusetts
and
rhode
island,
this
very
same
power.
this
is
not
an
instance
where
congress
simply
follows
the
problem,
as
it
did
in
the
decision
which
the
court
upheld
last
year,
the
statute
which
the
court
upheld
last
year
in
hodell,
where
congress
dealt
with
a
problem,
and
after
extensive
hearings
found
that
although
the
statute,
the
strip
mining
act
fell
peculiarly
upon
virginia,
what
congress
was
doing
was
simply
following
the
problem
wherever
it
found
it.
nor
is
it
an
instance,
we
suggest,
as
in
the
voting
rights
case,
the
katzenbach
case,
where
congress
selectively
carves
out
its
remedial
powers
in
response
to
a
national
problem.
here,
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
find
themselves
on
the
receiving
end
of
action
which
we
assume
for
argument
purposes
but
for
congressional
action
would
violate
the
commerce
clause,
yet
at
the
same
time
our
action
is
judged,
of
course,
by
the
higher
standard
of
the
commerce
clause,
since
we
lack
that
congressional
grant.
we
suggest
that
such
an
unprecedented
result
is
contrary
to
the
very
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause.
this
court
has
in
the
past
found
great
meaning
in
the
silences,
in
the
great
silences
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
has
interpreted
that
provision
in
the
name
of
national
unity
and
free
commerce
as
inhibiting
the
states.
we
suggest
that
there
is
another
great
silence
in
the
commerce
clause
which
places
certain
limits
on
congress,
admittedly
very
narrow
ones.
those
limits
at
a
minimum
preclude
congress
from
selectively
choking
off
interstate
commerce
in
a
manner
that
bears
no
rational
relationship
to
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
donald
k.
stern
yes,
it
could
have,
your
honor.
we
think
that
congress
can--
mr.
donald
k.
stern
--oh,
no,
no,
your
honor.
by
mentioning
new
hampshire,
i
am
focusing
on
the
fact
that
it
is
new
hampshire
and
her
neighboring
states
that
are
before
the
court.
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
there
were
in
fact
other
states
which
arguably
fell
within
201(b).
mr.
donald
k.
stern
i
think
there
were
four,
your
honor,
and
there
now
remain,
i
think,
only
new
hampshire
and
wisconsin
which
at
all
suggest
that
they
have
any
authority.
wisconsin
is
not
before
the
court,
so
we
don't
know
what
authority
it
suggests.
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
again
make
clear
that
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
by
virtue
of
section
201(b)
intended
such
a
grant
of
authority
to
new
hampshire.
we
do
suggest
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
this
interpretation
of
201(b),
that
this
interpretation
provides
a
separate
basis
upon
which
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
