we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
new
england
power
company
against
new
hampshire.
it
appears
that
the
attorney
general
has
been
able
to
get
out
of
the
snows
and
arrive,
and
we
will
put
him
on
in
due
course.
he
must
be
anxious
to
get
back
to
those
snows
some
time
today.
mr.
huntington,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
