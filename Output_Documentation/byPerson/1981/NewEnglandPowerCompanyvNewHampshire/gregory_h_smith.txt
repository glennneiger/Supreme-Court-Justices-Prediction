mr.
gregory
h.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
without
meaning
any
disrespect
for
my
opposing
counsel,
or
for
the
counsel
in
my
office
who
drafted
the
brief
in
this
case,
which
i
approved,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
saying
to
the
court
that
in
preparing
for
this
argument,
i
reread
all
the
briefs
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
there
is
one
issue
in
this
case,
and
only
one
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
section
201(b)
of
the
1935
federal
power
act
upon
which
new
hampshire
relies
in
this
case
is
unconstitutional.
the
appellants,
to
prevail
in
this
case,
must
carry
their
burden
of
demonstrating
that
that
act
was
an
unconstitutional
act
by
congress.
if
they
do,
i
lose
this
case.
if
they
do
not,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
way
that
they
can
prevail.
i
ask
your
indulgence
to
treat
briefly
some
further
facts
which
have
already
been
referred
to
in
the
earlier
argument.
section
201(b),
as
i
think
you
know,
provided
in
fairly
explicit
terms
that
a
state
would
not
be
deprived
of
its
lawful
authority
now
exercised
over
the
exportation
of
hydroelectric
energy
which
is
transmitted
across
a
state
line.
that
act
of
congress
adopted
the
practice
then
in
existence
in
four
states
in
the
union
and
wrote
it
right
into
the
law.
the
hydroelectric
power
plants
in
new
hampshire
on
the
connecticut
river,
which
is
in
fact
wholly
within
new
hampshire,
generate
electricity
without
any
interstate
character
in
the
generation
of
the
electricity
itself.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
what
that
section
of
201(b)
means,
the
appellants
have
called
upon
the
right
state
to
give
the
answer.
that
section,
which
was
an
amendment
to
the
federal
power
act
when
it
proceeded
through
congress,
was
introduced,
was
sponsored,
and
shepherded
through
congress
by
representatives
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
in
doing
so,
the
congressman
from
the
state
of
new
hampshire
addressed
his
colleagues
by
saying,
"the
senate
bill
as
originally
drawn
would
deprive
certain
states,
i
think
five
in
all,
of
certain
rights
which
they
have
over
the
exportation
of
hydroelectric
energy
which
is
transmitted
across
the
state
line.
"
"this
situation
has
been
taken
care
of
by
the
house
committee,
and
i
hope
you
will,
when
you
come
to
it,
section
201
of
part
2
of
the
1935
power
act,
that
you
will
grant
us
the
privilege
to
continue
as
we
have
been
for
22
years,
to
exercise
our
state
right
over
the
exportation
of
hydroelectric
energy
transmitted
across
state
lines,
but
produced
up
there
in
the
granite
hills
of
old
new
hampshire.
"
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
i
do
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
that
statute,
which
was
enacted
in
1913,
applied
to
the
connecticut
river
hydro
plants
after
1926,
and
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
all
of
the
hydroelectric
plants
subject
to
this
appeal
were
built
or
taken
over
by
the
new
england
power
company
after
1926.
i
think
the
record
also
shows
that
in
1934,
the
public
utilities
commission
was
asked
by
the
new
england
power
company
or
its
predecessor
with
respect
to
these
dams
for
permission
to
export
hydroelectric
energy
out
of
new
hampshire,
and
that
permission
was
granted.
it
has
been
exercised
from
the
beginning,
and
the
owners
of
the
current
dams
have
taken
their
interest
in
these
dams,
apparently
realizing
that
expressly,
and
i
believe
there
is
reference
to
that
in
the
record.
it
is
our
position,
in
fact,
contrary
to
our
opponents',
that
that
authority
was
exercised,
and
that
the
other
states,
west
virginia,
maine,
and
wisconsin,
had
also
statutes
on
the
books
at
that
time,
and
it
was
authority
which
had
been
used.
it
was
lawful
authority,
and
we
believe
the
reference
to
lawful
authority
in
the
statute
can
have
only
one
intelligible
meaning.
it
meant
enacted
into
law.
they
were
writing
at
the
time
in
an
obvious
context.
this
particular
statute
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress,
and
it
was
with
this
particular
statute
in
mind
that
that
amendment
was
offered
and
incorporated
into
the
1935
power
act.
it
is
placed
in
the
section
in
which
the
other
authority
of
states
regulating
hydroelectric
energy
export
is
also
dealt
with.
that
is,
the
authority
to
control
interstate
shipments
for
ultimate
consumption
and
the
authority
to
regulate
wholly
intrastate
authority,
and
as
further
support
for
our
view
of
the
clear
intention
of
congress
as
expressed
in
this
act,
in
the
1978
amendments,
the
public
utilities
regulatory
policy
act,
a
further
amendment
to
201(b)
allowed
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
require
pooling,
to
mandate
interconnection
of
hydroelectric
plants,
and
there
is
an
exception
created
in
that
amendment
to
this
provision
upon
which
we
rely
today,
indicating
that
congress
had
some
idea
that
without
that
exception
the
201(b)
as
we
construe
it,
and
as
we
think
it
clearly
takes
effect
in
this
case,
would
have
prevented
mandated
pooling
ordered
by
the
federal
authorities.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
we
think
that
it
very
well
may
have
been,
and
we
think
that
reviewing
the
authorities
from
this
court,
the
control
that
a
state
may
have
over
the
natural
resources
within
its
boundaries
which
it
owns
is
a
question
that
has
been
somewhat
left
open
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--certainly
it
has
been
argued
before
this
court
today.
in
our
view,
the
states
do
have
such
authority
to
control
their
natural
resources,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
such
recent
authority
as
the
rees
versus
state
case,
the
cement
plant,
indicating
that
a
state,
when
it
owns
the
thing
of
commercial
value,
may
have
far
more
authority
to
control
the
delivery
of
that
into
the
stream
of
commerce
than
it
would
have
with
respect
to
other
matters.
it
is
our
position
here
today
before
you,
however,
that
that
is
not
the
question
before
the
court,
that
201(b)
clearly
provides
that
new
hampshire
may
exercise
its
authority
under
the
statute,
and
the
court
need
go
no
further
to
decide
this
case--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--i
would
interpret
it
the
way
i
have
now.
that
is,
that
if
i
assume,
as
you
have
asked
me
to,
that
this
section
was
required
as
a
grant
of
authority
by
congress
in
order
to
avoid
what
would
otherwise
have
affected
the
commerce
clause,
then
relying
upon
an
interpretation
of
lawful
authority
that
referred
directly
to
the
constitution
would
not
make
any
sense.
it
is
our
view
that
the
use
of
the
word
"lawful"
referred
to
the
new
hampshire
statute
which
had
been
called
to
the
attention
of
congress,
and
to
construe
it
as
a
direct
reference
to
the
constitution
when
congress
didn't
say
constitutional
or
cite
some
provision
of
the
constitution,
renders
the
entire
exercise
meaningless.
it
becomes
circular.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
take
the
position
it
does
not.
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
perfectly
clear
what
the
reference
was
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
this
particular
provision.
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
viewed
as
a
grant
or
a
savings
clause.
it
is
plain
from
the
reading
of
the
statute
that
what
congress
did
was
adopt
the
practice
of
new
hampshire
and
other
states
and
permit
us
to
go
on
doing
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
analyzing
it
rigidly
by
other
cases
which
refer
to
grants
or
savings
of
one
authority
or
another
is
somewhat
beside
the
point.
this
particular
statute
is
very
specific,
and
in
fact
was
enacted
in
order
to
authorize
exactly
what
we
were
doing
in
1935
and
what
we
are
doing
today.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
authority
for
new
hampshire
to
control
the
water
itself
at
the
time
that
section
201(b)
was
enacted
was
clearer
than
the
authority
with
respect
to
hydroelectric
energy,
and
that
is
largely
because
congress
had
acted
to
regulate
hydroelectric
energy
in
part
1
of
the
federal
power
act
of
1920
and
then
again
at
the
time
that
this
was
enacted.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
misunderstood.
there
is
authority
from
this
court
which
prevents
diverting
the
natural
flow
of
a
river
out
of
the
state,
and--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
question
is
whether
new
hampshire
might
interfere
with
the
flow
of
the
river
in
massachusetts,
as
in
this
particular
river
or
this
case,
this
river
runs
into
other
states
in
which
other
states
may
have
some
interest
in
the
flow,
certainly
the
same
interest
new
hampshire
has
in
the
flow
of
the
river,
and
the
ownership
of
the
bed
under
it
that
we
make
in
our
briefs
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
there
is
any
question
of
new
hampshire
interfering
with
the
flow
of
the
river
itself
downstream
to
such
an
extent
that
states
downstream
from
new
hampshire
are
in
any
worse
position
than
they
were
before,
and
in
fact
in
this
particular
case
the
order
which
is
before
the
court
is
one
which
does
not
even
block
the
exportation
of
hydroelectric
energy
or
the
pooling
of
that
energy
in
the
new
england
power
pool.
instead,
it
simply
requires
that
there
be
an
accounting
or
bookkeeping
which
treats
it
as
though
the
fact
that
it
had
been
sold
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
it
does
not
undo
the
new
england-wide--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--i
think
it
is
clearly
beyond
the
scope
of
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
new
hampshire
doesn't
assert
any
control
by
this
statute,
and
has
not
asserted
in
this
case
any
control
over
those
derivative
products
which
may
be
benefitted
from
the
flow
of
this
river.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
new
hampshire
asserts
control
only
over...
only
over
the
flow--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--mr.
huntington's
argument
goes
too
far.
mr.
huntington
asserts
that
new
hampshire
is
trying
to
control
any
benefits
at
all
from
that
hydroelectric
energy
wherever
it
may
be...
wherever
the
power
generated
by
that
river
may
in
fact
aid
in
some
incremental
way
in
improving
the
economic
value
of
some
other
part
of
commerce.
new
hampshire
hasn't
done
anything
of
the
sort.
new
hampshire
is
only
asserting
its
control
under
the
statute
over
the
generation
of
the
power
itself.
we
go
no
further
than
that
in
terms
of
what
happens
to
products.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute
which
would
permit
us
to
exercise
it
over
anything
more.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
that
certainly
isn't
what
is
at
issue
here.
all
we
have
is
a
statute
which
regulates
the
power
itself,
and
more
importantly,
a
statute
which--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
would
have
to
be
whether
congress
could
pass
a
statute
permitting
the
state
of
new
hampshire--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--i
think
it
could.
we
do
not
take
the
position--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--i
think
congress
could,
and
i
think
that
the
important
point
which
is
raised
by
the
argument
to
which
you
refer
is
that
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
selectivity
of
this
particular...
the
application
of
201(b).
i
think
that
the
language
in
201(b)
which
refers
to
authority
now
exercised
is
descriptive
and
not
limiting.
in
other
words,
although
it
is
not
before
the
court
today,
it
seems
to
me
it
may
be
left
to
another
day
whether
if
another
state
enacts
a
statute
like
this
it
may
argue
that
the
reference
in
201(b)
was
to
authority
like
new
hampshire's.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
they
could
pass
such
a
statute,
and
congress
could
adopt
such
a
statute,
and
i
think
that
it
would...
and
i
assume
that
it
would
apply
to
all
states
equally,
in
order
to
permit
the
regulation,
for
example,
of
flour
by
the
states
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
we
have
not
contended
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
issue
may
have
been
raised
in
the
court
below.
all
that
is
done
by
the
order
in
this
case
is
a
regulation
of
the
volume
of
hydroelectric
energy,
and
we
refer,
i
think,
in
our
brief
to
a
footnote
in
authority
of
this
court
that
evidently
that
particular
section
was
one
which
was
not
concerned
with
ratemaking,
but
rather
was
concerned
with
regulation
or
prohibition
of
the
volume
of
hydroelectric
energy
which
could
be
exported
across
state
lines.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
in
constitutional
terms,
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
any
difference.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
the
reason,
your
honor,
that
attleboro
is
not
dispositive
is
that
congress
in
fact
has
exercised
its
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
and
has
adopted
the
new
hampshire
statute,
and
has
permitted
new
hampshire
to
regulate.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
yes.
i
think
that
attleboro
was
decided
when
congress
had
not
acted.
and
attleboro
decided
that
the
states
were
without
authority
to
regulate
wholesale
interstate
shipments
of
hydroelectric
energy
as
they
were
with
respect
to
gas.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
that's
right.
that's
right,
because
congress
decided,
having
been
called
upon
by
the
attleboro
decision
to
enter
the
field,
to
allocate
the
regulatory
authority
between
the
federal
power
commission
or
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
and
the
states,
and
the
section
of
the
statute
upon
which
we
rely
is
found
in
that
section
where
congress
was
allocating
the
authority
to
regulate.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
it
allocated
it
very
nearly
like
the
attleboro
decision,
permitting
states
to
regulate
interstate
shipments
which
were
for
retail
or
ultimate
consumption,
and
states
to
regulate
wholly
intrastate
sales.
the
clause
in
201(b)
upon
which
we
rely
is
in
nearly
the
same
section,
and
in
that
section
congress
has
permitted
new
hampshire
to
regulate
the
energy
generated
at
its
hydroelectric
plants,
and
so
it
is
part
of
the
process
of
congress
in
deciding
whether
a
federal
agency
or
a
state
agency
would
be
better
suited
to
regulating
that
particular
part
of
commerce.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
well,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
whatever
suggests
that
congress
wasn't
guided
by
the
particular
statutes
which
we
can
look
to
as
the
authority,
that
is,
that
lawful
authority
meant
something
less
than
what
you
have
suggested
to
me,
your
honor.
it
meant
that
authority
or
that
kind
of
authority
which
is
being
exercised
now
by
four
states
under
their
state
law,
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
congress
was
referring
exactly
to
these
statutes.
authority
which
is
broader
than
that
i
don't
think
fairly
falls
under
that
statute.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
i
think
it
does
both,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
clearly
takes
care
of
the
pre
emption
question
by
its
very
terms,
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
when
we
look
to
the
statute
and
the
way
in
which
it
was
placed
in
the
act
that
it
also
was
enacted
by
congress
presumed
to
be
aware
of
its
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
to
adopt
the
new
hampshire
practice
and
permit
it.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
no,
i
am
saying
that
congress
may
act
when
it
chooses
to
under
the
commerce
clause
to
permit
the
states
to
regulate
where
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
regulate
without
an
authorizing
act
of
congress.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
and
i
think
that
that
power
that
congress
has
has
always
been
referred
to
as
plenary
authority
to
enter
the
field,
and
it
is
clear
that
congress
may
go
further
in
permitting
states
to
regulate
than
states
could
have
regulated
if
congress
had
not
acted.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
no,
i
think
that
congress
may
permit
the
states
to
regulate.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
well,
i
think
that
congress
in
that
case,
congress
had
not
addressed
the
matter
at
all,
as
i
recall
it.
and
it
was
clear
that
the
silence
of
the
commerce
clause
was
sufficient
to
render
unconstitutional
the
action
of
the
state
in
having
provided
the
preference
to
the
private
entrepreneur.
the
question
here,
however,
is
different.
the
question
here
is
one
in
which
congress,
not
unlike
other
situations,
has
acted,
has
acted
with
this
particular
authority
specifically
in
mind,
and
has
permitted
states
to
exercise
this
type
of
authority
in
regulating
private
enterprise.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
yes,
they
are.
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--the
grid
was
established
voluntarily
by
the
private
power
companies,
and
now--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
i
think
that
with--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--that's
correct,
and
the
1978
amendments
provide
that
for
the
first
time
the
federal
authority
may
require
interconnection
and
wheeling
of
authority
across
utilities
to
others.
before
that,
it
was
voluntary,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
clear
effect
of
that
is
that
if
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
wants
to
exercise
the
authority
it
now
has,
there
is
a
specific
provision
exempting
that
kind
of
authority,
that
is,
mandatory
pooling,
from
the
effect
of
201(b),
but
that
wasn't
so
until
1978.
congress
specifically
exempted
this
kind
of
federal
authority
from
the
effect
of
the
authority
given
the
states
under
201(b).
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
that
is
essentially...
that
is
essentially
correct,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
have
not
withdrawn--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--they
have
filed
a
brief,
and
they
do
oppose
it,
in
fact,
your
honor.
i
would
simply
like
to
conclude,
in
sum,
by
saying
that
if
201(b)
or
the
clause
upon
which
we
rely
has
any
possible
meaning,
it
must
authorize
what
new
hampshire
was
doing
in
1935
and
what
we
are
continuing
to
do
today,
and
appellants--
mr.
gregory
h.
smith
--i
don't
think
in
this
particular
case
there
would
be
any
occasion
to
do
that,
but
i
think
with
the
1978
amendments,
that
were
new
hampshire
to
have
exercised
its
authority
more
broadly,
and
to
have
required
that
the
wires
be
snipped,
as
it
said
in
the
briefs,
that
with
the
1978
amendments,
for
the
first
time
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
could
mandate
interconnection
and
wheeling,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
clear,
but
new
hampshire
has
not
exercised
authority
that
broad
in
this
particular
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appellants
can
prevail
in
only
one
of
two
ways.
they
must
either
have
met
their
burden
of
proof
that
the
act
of
congress
which
remained
unchallenged
for
45
years
is
unconstitutional,
which
they
have
not
done,
or
they
can
go
across
the
street
to
congress
and
ask
congress
to
amend
the
statute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
