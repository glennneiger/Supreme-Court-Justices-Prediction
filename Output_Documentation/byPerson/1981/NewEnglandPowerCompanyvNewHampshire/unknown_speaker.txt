unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
the
federal
power
act
of
'35
doesn't
either
hinder
or
help
you,
or
at
any
rate
you
don't
need
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is,
mr.
huntington?
unknown
speaker
where
have
you
cited
that?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
of
congressman
rodgers'
comment?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
what
do
you
think
that
clause
saved
for
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
did
it
have?
as
a
practical
matter,
what
did
that
clause
save,
in
your
view,
for
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
it
may
also
have
saved
the
power
of
new
hampshire
to
regulate
retail
interstate
sales?
unknown
speaker
as
opposed
to
wholesale?
unknown
speaker
are
there
two
federal
acts
you
are
talking
about?
because
certainly
there
is
a
considerable
lapse
of
time
between
the
attleboro
and
the
'35
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
huntington,
are
you...
you
are
arguing
first
pre
emption,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
taking
that
approach?
unknown
speaker
on
pre
emption
would
the
case
be
clear
for
you
if
201
wasn't
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
would
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
that
without
201(b)
your
pre
emption--
unknown
speaker
--well,
suppose
we
agreed
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
201(b)
did
save
state
power?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
never
get
to
the
commerce
clause
argument
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
we
must
face
the
pre
emption
argument
first?
unknown
speaker
not
if
201(b)
saves
state
power.
unknown
speaker
if
it
does,
it
doesn't
violate
the
commerce
clause,
the
new
hampshire
law
doesn't
violate
the
commerce
clause,
either.
unknown
speaker
we
at
least
have
to
construe
the
statute
in
order
to
determine
which
of
those
it
is.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
cases
like
that
and
attleboro
would
come
out
the
same
way
today?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
prudential
against
benjamin
and
cases
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
partly,
too,
your
citizens,
according
to
new
hampshire,
are
migrating
to
new
hampshire.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
a
grandfathering
thing,
according
to
the
congressman
from
new
hampshire,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
effect,
mr.
stern,
you
are
suggesting
that
this
statute
might
just
as
well
have
read,
state
of
new
hampshire.
unknown
speaker
that
that
is
the
only
one
of
the
50
states
to
which
it
could
apply?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
it
is
true
that
at
that
time,
the
state
had
never
in
effect
exercised
its
power,
is
it
not,
by
any
action
of
the
public
utilities
commission?
it
simply
had
a
statute
on
the
books
which
would
have
permitted
the
public
utilities
commission
to
have
acted?
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
would
you
also
say
that
in
the
absence
of
the
statute,
that
new
hampshire's
actions
were
lawful
under
the
commerce
clause?
in
other
words,
was
it
in
fact
a
lawful
exercise
of
authority
by
new
hampshire
at
the
time
congress
acted?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
it
is
arguable,
is
it
not,
that
at
the
time
congress
acted
the
first
time
with
201(b),
that
the
action,
whatever
it
was,
that
was
being
taken
by
new
hampshire
was
not
lawful
under
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right,
but
help
me
over
that
interpretation,
if
you
will.
assume
for
a
moment
that
it
was
unlawful
for
new
hampshire
to
be
regulating
that
at
the
time
that
201(b)
was
passed,
and
201(b)
was
a
grant
of
power
for
a
lawful
exercise
by
new
hampshire.
then
how
do
you
interpret
the
statute,
201(b),
to
help
you?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
be
an
equally
plausible
interpretation
to
say
that
it
is
a
savings
clause
in
effect,
that
congress
does
not
wish
to
pre
empt
those
states
which
are
exercising
lawful
authority
by
virtue
of
the
enactment
of
this
particular
act
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
to
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
suppose
new
hampshire
had
a
statute
that
authorized
the
state
to
divert
or
retain
within
the
state
any
waters
including
navigable
waters
for
the
purposes
of
hydroelectric
power
for
the
state
or
irrigation
or
transportation,
and
then
you
had
section
201(b)
making
a
judgment
that
that
was
presumably
a
valid
right.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
specifically,
do
you
think
new
hampshire
could
keep
all
the
navigable
waters
that
come
into
the
state
within
the
state
and
not
let
them
flow
on
through?
unknown
speaker
my
hypothetical
was
that
new
hampshire
asserted
in
a
statute
that
it
had
authority
to
do
that,
contrary
to
other
views.
would
section
201(b)
give
it
any
more
than
it
had
before?
would
it
give
new
hampshire
any
more
rights
with
respect
to
those
navigable
waters
than
it
had
before
the
passage
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
what
about
mr.
huntington's
point
about
milled
flour?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
not
any
control,
why
are
we
here?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
answer
i
want
about
flour.
unknown
speaker
could
it
exercise
that
over
the
production
of
flour?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
they
pass
such
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
could
they
pass
such
a
statute,
and
would
it
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
congress
pass
such
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
might
just
as
well
get
to
it.
i
am
going
to
keep
asking
until
you
get
to
it.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
say
they
couldn't
pass
a
statute
concerning
flour,
because
that
is
not
in
effect
today.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
lawful
authority
language
in
201(b)?
you
don't
contend
that
that
language
would
have
authorized
new
hampshire
to
regulate
the
rates
on
interstate
sales
of
electricity,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
in
constitutional
terms,
what
is
the
difference
between
a
state
regulation
of
rates
and
a
state
regulation
of
volume?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
is
no
difference,
doesn't
attleboro
establish
they
could
not
regulate
rates
and
ergo
they
could
not
regulate
volume
either?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
that
is
true,
has
it
not
also
revitalized
what
attleboro
put
an
end
to?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
why
lawful...
do
you
get
the
thrust
of
my
concern?
unknown
speaker
my
question,
in
effect,
is,
did
attleboro
remain
good
law
after
the
enactment
of
201(b)?
unknown
speaker
to
whom
did
it
allocate
that
authority?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
suppose
i
were
to
read
section
201(b)
to
mean
that
the
clause
shall
not
deprive
a
state
or
state
commission
of
whatever
lawful
authority
it
now
exercises,
and
so
on,
would
you
say
that
would
be
an
improper
construction
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
agree,
or
would
you,
that
if
your
reading
of
that
statute
takes
care
of
the
pre
emption
aspect,
it
doesn't
automatically
follow
that
it
controls
the
commerce
clause
aspect
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
interpret
the
commerce
clause
in
a
way
that
is
binding
on
everyone
else?
unknown
speaker
certainly
article
1
would
give
you
that
impression,
wouldn't
it,
when
it
delegates
to
congress
the
right
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
mean
by
that
that
if
congress
passed
a
statute
that
vested
in
the
robert
fulton
steamship
company
the
right
to
regulate
traffic
on
the
hudson
river
in
new
york,
that
that
would
be
binding
on
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
gibbons
against
ogden,
the
state
had
delegated
that
authority
to
mr.
fulton
and
his
colleagues,
hadn't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
how
would
this
preference
be
effected?
and
it
doesn't
contemplate,
does
it,
any
new
transmission
lines
or
anything,
or
does
it?
unknown
speaker
are
the
new
hampshire
customers
who
are
going
to
be
preferred
going
to
be
serviced
out
of
the
interstate
grid
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
established
the
grid?
unknown
speaker
and
approved
by
the
fec?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
statute
if
the
fec
said,
well,
maybe
you
can
preserve
your
own
power
for
your
own
new
hampshire
customers,
but
if
you
are
going
to
do
that,
build
your
own
transmission
lines,
and
don't
depend
on
the
grid?
unknown
speaker
new
hampshire
wants
to
effect
this
preference
through
the
grid
system,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
domain
for
new
hampshire
to
demand
that
its
customers
be
preferred
out
of
the
power
in
the
grid.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
fec,
fer
doesn't
agree
with
you
on
that.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
the
ferc
could
step
in
at
this
stage
and
say
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
decision
and
puc
decision
were
superseded
by
a
new
order
of
the
ferc?
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
bank
holding
company
act
enacted?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you
concede
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
pre
empt
new
hampshire's
authority
by
the--
unknown
speaker
--you
essentially
then
agree
with
the
position
of
the
united
states,
or
the
ferc,
with
respect
to
pre
emption?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
that
bear
on
pre
emption,
even
if
congress
is
wrong
as
to
its
perception
of
the
constitutional
law,
if
it
enacts
a
statute
under
that
misapprehension?
the
misapprehension
may
be
a
valid
tool
for
construing
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
the
position
of
the
united
states
or
the
ferc
and
you
on
pre
emption
is
that
however
you
construe
201(b),
that
new
hampshire
has
gone
way
beyond
whatever
congress
may
have
approved
in
that.
it
never
approved
this
approach
to
keeping
the
power
within
new
hampshire.
