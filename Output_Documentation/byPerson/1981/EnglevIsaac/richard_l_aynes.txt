mr.
richard
l.
aynes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
this
case
presents
two
overriding
issues.
first
of
all,
may
the
state
require
an
accused
to
prove
his
innocence
by
establishing
that
he
acted
in
lawful
self-defense,
and
second,
should
the
procedural
default
rule
that
this
court
last
fully
addressed
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
be
extended
to
apply
to
errors
which
affect
the
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process
and
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
guilt/innocence
determination
process.
i
think
that
on
its
fact,
these
may
appear
to
be
substantive
and
procedural
issues
that
you
can
separate,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
them,
they
are
intertwined
here.
and
i
say
that
because
i
think
the
nature
of
the
error
itself
is
relevant
not
only
to
establishing
the
error
occurred,
but
more
importantly,
to
establishing
that
the
skyes
principles
at
least
by
their
own
force
do
not
apply
to
this
case,
and
they're
also
relevant
to
determining
cause
and
prejudice.
i'd
like
to
address
the
sykes
application,
but
i'd
just
like
to
make
one
response
to
some
of
the
points
that
mr.
karas
made.
he,
in
tracing
the
history
of
the
case,
he
may
have
left
the
court
with
the
impression
that
there
was
an
exhaustion
issue
here.
i
would
simply
point
out
that
the
lowe
courts
have
found
no
question
of
exhausting
state
remedies.
i
don't
believe
that
that
defense
was
ever
asserted
in
these
proceedings.
also,
it
was
indicated
that
the
record
before
the
court
demonstrated
there
was
no
objection
to
these
jury
instructions.
i
think
that's
certainly
true
of
mr.
isaac's
case,
it's
certainly
true
of
my
client,
mr.
hughes.
but
as
we
indicated
in
the
brief,
there's
no
transcript
before
this
court,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
mr.
bell's
counsel
did
or
did
not
object.
turning
to
the
sykes
question,
i
think
if
we
focus
on
sykes,
we
see
that
in
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
davis
and
going
through
sykes,
none
of
those
cases
dealt
with
the
fundamental
integrity
of
the
guilt-determining
process.
in
sykes,
for
example,
we're
talking
about
a
voluntary...
not
even
a
voluntary
issue...
of
a
prophylactic
rule
under
miranda.
in
none
of
those
cases
did
we
have
the
factual
basis
for
the
error
in
the
record.
i
think
this
court
specifically,
in
wainwright
v.
sykes
and
in
the
course
of
the
oral
argument
inquired
about
plain
error,
and
the
response
was
of
course
no,
we
didn't
have
a
suppression
hearing,
so
therefore,
the
factual
basis
wasn't
there;
therefore,
it
couldn't
be
plain
error.
and
i
think
most
importantly,
both
counsel
for
wainwright
as
well
as
the
united
states
who
appeared
as
an
amicus
advocated
the
procedural
default
rule
and
in
presenting
that
argument
to
the
court,
they
specifically
disavowed
any
intent
to
apply
that
to
any
rule
that
would
make
a
decision
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
that's
in
marked
contrast
to
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
ohio
told
its
juries
if
the
state
does
not
dis-prove
self-defense,
at
least
by
the
robinson
decision,
then
this
man
is
innocent.
it
goes
to
the
very
heat
of
that
determination.
it
made
the
whole
difference
here
between
an
acquittal
and
punishment.
also,
the
error
is
in
the
record.
we
don't
have
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing,
we
don't
have
to
go
back
and
make
reconstructions.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
focus
upon
the
nature
of
the
error
to
this
extent.
that
in
any
other
situation,
a
conscientious
jury
could
still
come
back
with
a
proper
verdict.
if
the
prosecutor
comments
on
silence,
i
can
ignore
it.
if
the
prosecutor
makes
an
inflammatory
comment
i
can
ignore
it.
even
if
an
involuntary
confession
comes
in
i
can
ignore
it
as
a
juror
based
upon
the
very
reasons
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
excluded
it
in
the
first
place.
but
in
this
case,
a
conscientious
jury
would
have
followed
this
erroneous
statute.
and
that's
what
makes...
i'm
sorry,
the
erroneous
instruction,
and
that's
what
makes
it
so
critical
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
determining
process.
i
think
that
where
we
end
up
at
least
with
that
is
that
sykes,
by
its
own
terms,
was
not
designed
to
apply
here.
that
we
go
back
and
we
look
to
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
error,
and
it
should
suggest
that
relief
is
available
without
ever
reaching
the
sykes
question.
with
respect
to
the
state
law
question,
i
think
that
we
have
to
go
back...
and
perhaps
i
could
clarify
just
a
couple
of
points.
the
poole
case
that
my
friend
mr.
karas
makes
reference
to,
is
a
1973
ohio
supreme
court
case.
we
did
not
cite
it
in
our
brief;
he
does
cite
it
in
his
brief,
and
he
quotes
sections
from
it.
and
part
of
the
language
he
is
relying
on
is
the
ohio
supreme
court
saying
some
commentators
have
said
this
is
true.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
well,
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
i
think
we
can
track
into
an
argument
that
i
haven't
advanced,
but
it
tracks
closely
to
mr.
kingsley's
retroactivity
question.
i
wouldn't
say
fundamental
error
as
much
as
error
that
affects
the
accuracy
of
the
factfinding
process.
and
i
think
that
that's
a
very
similar
rationale
to
the
test
of
retroactivity
that
this
court
has
developed,
for
example,
in
hankerson,
deciding
whether
to
apply
mullaney
v.
wilbur
retroactively.
and
i
think
what
we
have
to
look
at
is
when
we
consider
the
jury,
not
just
is
this
an
error
in
and
of
itself,
or
even
is
it
a
constitutional
error,
but
is
this
the
type
of
error
that
raises
serious
questions
about
the
accuracy
of
the
jury
in
performing
its
function
in
making
findings
of
fact
and
determining
guilt
or
innocence.
i
think
while
we,
i
suppose,
would
have
to
go
through
a
whole
continuum
of
examples,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
when
the
burden
of
proof
is
shifted,
whether
that
burden
of
proof
is
required
by
state
statute
or
is
required
by
federal
constitutional
law,
that
that
does
impinge
upon
the
varying--
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
--i
stumble
over
the
word
retroactivity,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
i
can
answer
that
yes
and
say
that's
true.
i'd
like
to
clarify
it
only
from
this
point.
one
of
the
problems
we
have
in
the
whole
ohio
system,
i
submit
to
the
court,
is
confusion
over
where
the
source
of
this
right
comes
from.
and
that
confusion
was
indicated
in
the
brief,
i
think.
unfortunately,
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
has
not
helped
to
clarify
this
situation.
in
state
v.
robinson,
the
ohio
supreme
court
uses
language
such
as
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
clear.
it
doesn't
admit
to
substantial
doubt.
we
can't
really
have...
and
this
is
not
a
quote;
the
first
two
were
quotes...
but
we
can't
really
have
a
good
faith
argument
about
what
this
statute
means.
the
ohio
supreme
court
never
uses
the
term
retroactivity
in
any
of
its
cases.
solicitor
general
in
their
amicus
brief
argues...
and
i
understand
the
argument...
they
come
in
and
argue
that
this
right
stems
from
the
statute.
and
we
don't
really
have
a
retroactive
problem
at
all.
now
of
course,
the
problem
with
that
is
i
can
impeach
that
position,
it
seems
to
me,
by
the
ohio
supreme
court's
own
decision
in
state
v.
rogers.
if
it's
as
clear
as
you
said
it
was
in
1976
in
robinson,
how
did
you,
the
ohio
supreme
court,
make
that
mistake
in
state
v.
rogers
in
1975
when
you
told
us
it
didn't
change
the
burden
of
proof?
and
i
think
the
only
satisfactory
answer
that
i
have
been
able
to
come
up
with
to
that
is
it's
perhaps
analogous
to
this
optical
illusion
that
folks
have--
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
--well,
as
i
read
the
state
supreme
court's
opinion,
the
federal
issue
was
raised,
and
they
said
we
have
the
power
to
resolve
this
without
addressing
the
implications
of
mullaney,
an
therefore
we're
going
to
do
it--
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
--they
did
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
yes,
i
am,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
yes,
i
am,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
in
the
subsequent
cases,
state
v.
jones,
the
state
of
ohio
supreme
court
said
we're
not
talking
about
an
evidentiary
rule
here;
we're
talking
about
a
substantive
element.
in
that
case
they
struck
down
changing
the
burden
of
proof
based
on
ex
post
facto
position.
what
they're
saying,
in
effect,
is
that
this
goes
to
the
very
integrity
of
the
trial
process.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is,
for
example,
we
can
even
track
back
to
an
analogy
between
this
court's
cases,
say,
in
patterson,
that
basically
says
the
state
has
great
freedom
in
defining
what
the
elements
are
going
to
be,
what
the--
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
--they
have
not...
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
this,
though,
about
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
said
and
what
they
haven't
said.
they
have
never...
you're
absolutely
correct,
they
have
never
said
that
it
negates
an
element
of
crime,
and
they've
never
said
that
its
absence
is
an
element
of
crime.
what
they
have
said,
though,
in
the
chas,
abner
and
jones
cases
that
we've
cited
and
quoted
to
this
court,
is
that
when
the
jury
makes
its
decision
about
guilt
or
innocence,
they
consider
all
of
the
evidence.
and
as
part
of
all
of
that
evidence,
they
consider
whether
or
not
they
acted
in
self-defense.
now,
i
point
out
this
is
very
distinguishable
from
leland.
in
leland
the
insanity
case,
of
course,
the
statutory
scheme
was
that
you
considered
guilt
or
innocence;
once
you
decide
the
person
is
guilty,
you
go
on
to
consider
insanity
as
a
separate
element.
the
three
ohio
supreme
court
cases
that
post-date
this
statute
all
make
it
very
clear
ohio
doesn't
do
that.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
leland
case.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
even
under
this
case--
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
--i
think
in
terms
of
establishing
a
substantive
constitutional
violation,
i
think
we
probably
have
at
least
two
positions
on
that.
the
one
is
that
while
the
state
may
be
free
to
allocate
burden
of
proof
and
to
define
the
elements
of
the
crime,
once
it
makes
it
allocation,
this
is
so
important
it
can't
depart
from
that
without
violating
due
process.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
you're
talking
about
a
question
of
state
law,
the
court
is
then
free
to
make
that
decision?
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
what
is
ohio
is
back
in
the
position
is
perhaps
mullaney
v.
wilbur,
where
this
court
says,
in
effect,
you
don't
have
to
have
voluntary
manslaughter;
you
could
just
have
murder
one,
murder
two.
but
if
you
do
choose
to
have
voluntary
manslaughter,
then
there
are
certain
consequences
which
due
process
mandates.
and
i
think
that's
what
we're
saying
here.
that
you
may
not
have
to
accept...
you
know,
quite
frankly,
we
think
they
do
have
to
accept
burden
of
proof.
but
even
if
we
were
not
to
reach
that
point,
you
may
not
have
to
accept
the
burden
of
proof,
but
once
the
state
sets
the
agenda
and
says,
in
effect,
to
prove
a
man
guilty
we
must
prove
these
things;
any
departure
from
that
is
a
due
process
violation.
and,
of
course,
i
think
we
have
the
second
position
and
that
is,
unlike
insanity,
no
one
has
a
right
to
be
insane.
if
you
commit
an
act
that
would
otherwise
be
a
crime,
the
absence
of
intent
may
or
may
not
have
bearing
upon
whether
you
committed
that
crime.
but
under
self-defense
you
do
have
a
right
to
act
in
self-defense.
the
state
cannot
deprive
you
of
that
right.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
our
case
must
necessarily
stand
or
fall
in
that
position.
but
we
have
taken
the
position...
and
i
think
i'm
prepared
to
defend
that
position
even
though
there
are
no
decisions
from
this
court...
saying
that's
true,
that
you
have
a
constitutional
right
of
self-defense.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
no,
there
are
not,
your
honor.
but
if
the
state
tells
me,
for
example,
that
to
refrain
from
criminal
conduct
i
must
stand
here
and
allow
someone
to
assail
me
and
take
my
life,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
state
action
depriving
me
of
life
without
due
process.
if
it
says,
in
effect,
i
must
let
someone
commit
a
crime
rather
than
defend
myself,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
violation
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
i
could
go
on
with
right
of
privacy
and
other
constitutional
bases.
i
simply
point
out
on
the
sykes
issue
that
this
court
indicated
by
citing
henry-mississippi
that
in
every
case
you
must
look
to
the
specific
interests
that
are
supposed
to
be
advanced
by
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule.
those
interests
generally
coalesce
into
three
parts.
and
two
of
them
don't
exist
here.
we
don't
have
any
need
to
preserve
testimony
or
to
take
testimony
to
make
the
record
here.
we
also
don't
have
any
evidence
of
sandbagging.
my
friend
mr.
karas
has
indicated
in
his
petition
before
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
counsel
could
justify
we
lied
here.
we've
had
no
indication,
no
allegation
that
these
counsel
deliberately
withheld
these
charges
or
that
they
were
trying,
in
effect,
to
reserve
error
for
a
later
time.
the
only
interest
the
state
has
here
is
finality,
and
we're
suggesting
to
the
court
that
even
finality,
while
it
may
be
of
considerable
interest,
could
never
alone
outweigh
the
defendant's
interest,
when
we
have
an
error
of
this
magnitude.
i
think
also
there's
been
some
discussion
here
of
futility,
and
i'd
point
out
particularly
in
favor
of
my
client
mr.
hughes
that
we
had
a
binding
decision
from
the
ninth
district
court
of
appeals
which
is
unreported
but
we've
reproduced
it
in
the
addendum
that
we
lodged
with
the
clerk's
office
which
interpreted
the
statute
prior
to
mr.
hughes'
trial
and
said,
in
effect,
the
statute
didn't
change
it.
the
state's
interest
here
is
avoiding
retrials,
and
all
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
while
futility
is
generally
discussed
in
terms
of
cause,
we
would
like
the
court
to
focus
here
on
futility
in
terms
of
the
adequacy
of
the
state
grounds.
if
the
judge,
in
theory,
could
not
have
given
that
instruction,
it
serves
no
purpose
to
raise
the
objection
and
it
becomes
futile.
and
just
as
we
don't
require
futile
acts
under
the
exhaustion
requirement
which
is
comity-based,
neither
should
we
require
futile
acts
here.
of
course,
as
we've
also
tried
to
indicate
in
our
briefs,
if
the
court
goes
beyond
the
adequacy
of
the
state
grounds,
finds
it
adequate,
wants
to
look
to
cause
and
prejudice,
we
think
that
we've
demonstrated
cause
and
prejudice
here.
i'd
also
point
out
that
we
have
some...
both
of
these
individuals
filed
their
petitions
pro
se
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
cited
those
decisions...
i
guess
i
did
enter
one
of
those
cases
after
the
magistrate's
recommendation...
but
decided
those
cases
without
any
type
of
evidentiary
hearing.
and
the
only
reason
i
think
that
that
is
relevant
here
is
that
this
court
seems
to
suggest
in
its
recent
case
in
jenkins
v.
anderson
that
in
order
to
resolve
a
cause
type
of
question,
there
may
be
a
necessity
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
none
was
held
in
any
of
these
cases.
so
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
i
think
the
record
here
is
clear
enough
under
all
these
facts
that
we've
demonstrated
cause
without
that
hearing,
but
if
the
court
were
to
determine
otherwise,
then
we'd
suggest
that
perhaps
one
of
the
proper
remedies
would
be
to
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
point
out,
in
terms
of
assessing
what
counsel's
opportunity
was,
that
the
only
two
opinions
that
speak
directly
to
these
points
are
from
the
judges
closest
to
what
was
happening
in
the
state
of
ohio
come
from
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
in
ohio;
again,
an
unreported
case,
state
v.
hamilton
and
it's
in
the
addendum,
where
they
characterized
this
that
objecting
would
have
been
a
vain
act.
and
also,
judge
peck,
senior
status
on
the
sixth
circuit
who
authored
the
plurality
decision,
who
was
a
former
ohio
common
pleas
judge
and
also
former
ohio
supreme
court
judge,
and
he,
too,
looking
at
this
said
in
the
context
of
these
cases,
it
would
have
been
vain
or
it
would
have
been
futile
to
make
this
objection.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
yes,
your
honor,
on
the
theory
that
the
agenda
was
set
by
the
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
if
i
were
to
abandon
my
other
constitutional
claim
and
admit
that
that
is
purely
a
question
of
state
law
then
no,
i
don't
believe
they're
required
to
apply
it
retroactively.
mr.
richard
l.
aynes
i
think
you
can
track
that
on
either
due
process
or
almost
an
ex
post
facto
analysis
and
say
that
once
you
make
that
determination
on
the
very
important
issue
of
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof
on
self-defense,
the
state
locks
itself
into
that
position.
it's
very
similar
to
this
court's
decision
in
hicks
v.
oklahoma
where
the
state
tried
to
argue
this
is
merely
a
matter
of
sentencing.
and
the
court
came
back
and
said
no,
once
you
make
that
determination,
any
departure
from
that
is
going
to
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
thank
you.
