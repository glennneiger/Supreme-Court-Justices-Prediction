justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
clause
80-1430,
engle
versus
isaac,
the
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
case
arises
from
three
unrelated
criminal
convictions.
the
three
respondents
were
convicted
by
ohio
of
voluntary
manslaughter,
murder
and
aggravated
assault
respectively.
at
their
trials,
all
three
respondents
claimed
self-defense.
without
objections
from
the
respondents,
the
trial
judges
instructed
the
juries
that
respondents
bore
the
burden
of
proving
this
defense
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
after
the
ohio
courts
affirmed
the
convictions,
respondents
sought
federal
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
a
fair
reading
of
respondents'
habeas
petitions
informed
by
the
manner
in
which
the
district
judges
themselves
construed
the
petitions
reveals
that
each
respondent
presented
only
one
colorable
constitutional
claim
to
the
district
courts.
respondents
claim
that
the
trial
instructions
requiring
them
to
prove
absence
of
self-defense
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
conflicted
with
ohio's
constitutional
duty
to
prove
their
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
do
not
consider
the
merits
of
that
claim
because
respondents
fail
to
present
it
properly
to
the
ohio
courts.
under
ohio
law,
respondents
waived
their
objection
to
the
self-defense
instructions
when
they
failed
to
object
to
those
instructions
at
trial.
five
years
ago,
when
wainwright
versus
sykes,
we
held
that
a
state
prisoner
who
waived
the
constitutional
claim
during
state
proceedings
could
not
present
that
claim
in
a
federal
habeas
petition
unless
he
demonstrated
cause
for
an
actual
prejudice
from
a
default.
because
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
serves
important
interest
in
finality
and
on
comity,
we
reaffirmed
that
ruling
today.
we
find
that
respondents
have
shown
no
cause
for
their
procedural
defaults.
we
have
reversed
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
remanded
the
cases
per
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion.
justice
blackmun
concurs
in
the
result.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
brennan
joined
by
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
