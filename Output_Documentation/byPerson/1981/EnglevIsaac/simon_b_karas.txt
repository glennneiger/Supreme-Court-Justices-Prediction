mr.
simon
b.
karas
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
three
cases
before
this
court
for
decision,
the
state
of
ohio
is
attempting
to
give
meaning
and
content
to
the
decision
in
wainwright
v.
sykes.
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
deviceiveness
and
divergence
of
opinions
in
the
court
below,
but
i
think
that
there
is
one
word
that
is
missing
from
all
of
those
opinions
that
acts
as
a
common
defect,
and
that
is
the
absence
of
the
word
"federalism".
the
state
sees
this
issue
as
federalism,
pure
and
simple.
in
a
single
decision,
the
court
below
has
avoided
ohio's
construction
of
its
contemporaneous
objection
rule
and
has
also
overturned
a
state's
construction
of
its
own
substantive
law.
if
wainwright
v.
sykes
is
to
have
any
meaning,
it
must
be
grounded
in
the
concept
that
federalism
allows
a
state
certain
latitudes
in
the
administration
of
justice.
the
facts
in
our
case
are
relatively
simple.
prior
to
1974,
ohio
filed
the
common
law
rule
that
the
3
defendant
bore
the
burden
of
persuasion
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
on
the
affirmative
defense
of
self-defense,
insanity
and
duress.
on
january
1,
1974,
the
legislature
enacted
ohio
revised
code
2901.05(a)
which
provided
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
evidence
of
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
it
was
part
of
a
code
revision.
there
was
a
complete
revision
of
the
definitions
of
ohio
substantive
crimes;
there
was
also
a
revision
of
the
procedure.
ohio
adopted
criminal
rules
of
procedure
at
that
time
contemporaneously.
there
was
a
little
bit
of
divergence
in
the
time
when
they
took
place.
the
rule
started
in
1973
and
some
of
the
substantive
sections
in
1974.
now,
on
july
21,
1976,
the
ohio
supreme
court
decided
the
case
of
state
v.
robinson.
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
the
defendant
no
longer
bore
the
burden
of
persuasion
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
though
he
did
retain
a
burden
of
production
on
the
affirmative
defense.
the
three
cases
before
the
court
all
occurred
prior
to
the
robinson
decision.
mr.
hughes'
case
occurred
in
january
of
1975,
mr.
bell's
in
april
of
1975,
mr.
isaac's
in
i
believe
it
was
september
of
1975.
the
decision
in
state
v.
robinson
was
subsequently
held
retroactive
to
all
cases
that
had
been
tried
after
january
1,
1974,
which
was
the
date
that
the
statute
took
place.
at
none
of
the
trials
did
the
defendants
object
to
the
traditional
instruction
that
the
defendant
bore
the
burden
of
proof
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
if
he
failed
to
prove
that
defense
by
that
burden,
the
state
still
bore
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
thank
you.
i
will
pick
up
with
the
facts
because
i
believe
it's
very
important
how
these
cases
developed.
i
had
just
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
no
objection
to
the
traditional
instruction.
on
appeal,
only
one
of
the
three
defendants
raised
the
issue.
that
was
mr.
isaac.
it's
not
quite
clear
whether
he
was
raising
it
on
the
basis
that
the
state
court
should
apply
the
robinson
decision
as
to
him,
or
whether
there
was
a
simultaneous
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
traditional
instruction
as
well.
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
the
various
district
courts
decided
the
case
alternatively
on
a
lack
of
showing
of
cause,
and
also
a
lack
of
showing
of
prejudice.
on
rehearing
en
banc,
the
court
was
quite
split.
there
were
six
separate
opinions.
the
plurality
opinion
found
that
cause
was
shown
by
the
apparent
futility
of
raising
the
question
prior
to
robinson.
as
to
the
cause
question,
and
despite
the
fact
that
state
v.
robinson
was
a
state
statutory
interpretation,
the
court
found
that
ohio
had
created
an
additional
element
of
the
crime
of
absence
of
the
affirmative
defense.
now,
our
petition
has
challenged
both
the
cause
and
prejudice
rulings
by
the
court
below.
i
think
for
purposes
of
analysis
it
would
be
easier
to
start
with
the
cause
question.
i
start,
as
i
think
i
must,
with
the
decision
in
hankerson
v.
north
carolina,
footnote
8.
in
hankerson,
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
impact
of
applying
mullaney
v.
wilbur
retroactive
to
the
states.
i
think
it
ties
in
with
the
question
of
wainwright
because
hankerson
was
decided
six
days
prior
to
the
opinion
in
wainwright
v.
sykes.
now,
in
hankerson,
in
response
to
the
state's
concern
that
mullaney
would
dictate
over
700
rehearsals
of
homicide
convictions,
the
court
in
the
footnote
posited
that
the
fears
of
the
state
were
not
as
great
as
might
be
imagined
because
the
states,
if
they
wish,
may
be
able
to
insulate
prior
convictions
by
enforcing
the
normal
contemporaneous
objection
rule.
in
these
cases,
that's
exactly
what
ohio
did.
in
state
v.
williams
and
state
v.
humphries
they
found
that
the
failure
to
have
objected
was
a
waiver
of
the
question.
in
state
v.
long,
they
further
indicated
that
they
would
not
hold
a
state
v.
robinson
error
to
be
plain
error
just
merely
by
citation
to
the
case,
but
that
you
actually
had
to
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
individual
case.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
your
honor,
i
believe
that
hankerson
shows
the
correct
analysis
for
a
question
of
this
type.
i
don't
see
hankerson
as
being
a
novel
question
at
all.
i
think
it's
a
recognition
of
a
longstanding
doctrine
that
a
reviewing
court
need
not
reach
an
issue
which
a
party
complaining
of
the
error
could
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
but
did
not,
at
a
time
when
the
court
could
have
corrected
it
or
the
error
could
have
been
avoided.
now,
notice
that
i
say
the
word
could
have
rather
than
would
have,
because
i
think
that
there's
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
the
two
words,
and
also,
that
that
distinction
is
the
difference
between
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
plurality.
when
i
use
the
words
could
have
been
raised,
i
don't
mean
it
in
some
metaphysical
sense
that
you
could
always
raise
a
question;
that
counsel
should
anticipate
a
35th
amendment
to
the
constitution
that
has
not
yet
been
enacted.
i'm
also
not
indulging
in
the
legal
fiction
that
once
a
court
declares
the
law,
that
it
is
deemed
always
to
have
been
the
law
and
therefore,
a
failure
to
object
is
a
waiver
of
it.
i
think
it's
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
when
the
tools
are
available
to
construct
the
argument,
that
you
can
charge
counsel
with
the
obligation
of
raising
that
argument;
otherwise,
a
failure
to
raise
it
will
be
deemed
binding
on
the
client.
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
about
a
apparent
futility--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
is
somewhat
of
the
extension
that
the
respondents
are
trying
to
make.
they
are
going
one
step
farther
and
are
using
the
words
"should
have
raised"
the
question.
our
concern
about
wainwright
v.
sykes
is
that
if
you
don't
identify
any
middle
ground
in
which
the
actions
of
counsel
can
be
deemed
binding
on
the
client--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--and
not
incompetent,
that
you
effectively
destroy
the
decision.
if
the
objection
is
well
known,
then
the
failure
of
counsel
to
raise
it
will
be
deemed
ineffectiveness
of
counsel.
if
the
objection
is
not
well
known,
then
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
it
is
deemed
inadvertence
or
apparent
futility,
and
is
found
to
be
cause,
and
there's
no
middle
ground
between
the
two.
i
think
we're
giving
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there's
a
whole
range
of
decisions
that
counsel
are
entrusted
to
make,
and
sometimes,
the
power
to
make
a
decision
includes
the
power
to
err
or
the
power
not
to
see
a
question
that
should
have
been
raised.
take,
for
example,
the
argument
of
a
apparent
futility.
assume
that
counsel
actually
saw
the
argument
and
failed
to
raise
it
because
of
the
nature
of
the
prior
ohio
law.
that
is
as
strategic
as
any
other
decision
that
counsel
is
supposed
to
make.
now,
the
fact
that
he
does
not
raise
it
when
he
sees
the
argument
and
fails
to
raise
it
in
light
of
the
prior
law,
is,
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe,
an
inexcusable
procedural
default
of
a
known
right.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
objection
is
not
perceived
but
could
have
been
perceived--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--obviously,
the
question
was
raised,
and
any
time
you
have
an
overruling
of
a
prior
precedent
or
a
new
development
in
the
law,
somebody
has
to
make
the
first
step.
but
i
think
that
argument
can
be
shown
by
a
distinction
between
the
cases
of
o'connor
v.
ohio
and
lee
v.
missouri.
in
lee
v.
missouri,
this
court
held
that
duran
v.
missouri
was
retroactive
as
to
the
date
of
taylor
v.
louisiana;
but
indicated
that
the
failure
to
have
objected
might
be
deemed
a
waiver
of
that.
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
is
that
as
of
the
date
of
taylor
v.
louisiana,
the
objection
could
have
been
raised
even
if
it
was
not
raised
in
a
particular
case.
now,
in
the
case
of
o'connor
v.
ohio...
and
i'd
like
to
state
right
at
the
beginning
that
i
don't
believe
that
our
position
requires
the
overruling
of
o'connor
v.
ohio.
i
think
it
requires
a
different
look
at
the
case.
but
in
o'connor
v.
ohio,
the
trial
took
place
five
and
a
half
months
before
malloy
v.
hogan,
and
i
think
that
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
the
tools
were
not
even
available
for
counsel
to
have
constructed
the
argument.
it
might
be
a
different
case
once
malloy
v.
hogan
had
been
decided.
the
court
didn't
have
to
deal
with
those
types
of
questions
and
split
the
difference
between
could
have
raised
it
or
would
have
raised
it
or
should
have
raised
it,
when
you're
operating
under
the
deliberate
bypass
test.
but
once
you
go
to
the
notion
that
the
actions
of
counsel
can
bind
a
client,
then
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
a
different
light.
the
decision
in
o'connor
v.
ohio,
of
course,
was
the
decision
that
was
cited
by
the
appellate
court
as
to
why
the
result
was
dictated
that
counsel
should
not
anticipate
a
future
development
of
the
law.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
ohio
law
in
a
real
sense,
the
question
could
have
been
raised.
i'm
not
going
to
deny
that
it
was
difficult;
i
merely
say
that
the
grounds
were
there
that
counsel
could
have
raised
the
question.
first
of
all,
in
re
winship
had
been
decided
five
years
prior
to
the
development
in
these
cases.
mullaney
v.
wilbur
had
been
decided
three
months
prior
to
the
trial
in
mr.
isaac's
case.
there
was
discussion
of
this
issue.
the
first
appellate
court
decision
in
ohio
that
held
the
robinson
way
was
december
24,
1974,
which
was
well
prior
to
the
trials
in
these
cases.
if
you
look
at
the
state
v.
robinson
opinion
itself,
it
makes
reference
to
the
1979
technical
committee
report
on
the
proposed
criminal
reform.
there's
also
reference
to
a
law
journal
article,
v.
wilbur.
and
the
curious
thing
about
that
is
that
the
law
review
article
starts
out
with
the
proposition
that
the
legislature
did
not
intend
to
change
the
law,
but
then
concludes
arguing
that
mullaney
v.
wilbur
should
have
dictated
the
result.
i
would
invite
the
court
to
look
at
that
law
review
article
and
see
whether
or
not
an
ohio
counsel
could
have
raised
the
question
in
this
time
period.
there's
one
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
note
with
respect
to
the
question
of
"could
have
raised
it".
that
is
the
argument
that
has
been
made
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
bell
that
self
defense
inherently
requires
the
state
to
disprove
the
defense.
that
argument,
which
i
will
submit
is
not
correct
either
based
on
ohio
law
or
on
this
court's
decisions
in
patterson
v.
new
york
or
rivera
v.
delaware,
doesn't
depend
at
all
on
the
change
in
the
law.
the
argument,
could
it
be
constructed
accurately
according
to
ohio
law
now,
could
have
been
constructed
according
to
ohio
law
then.
robinson
didn't
change
that
at
all.
our
concern
is
that
a
limitation
of
wainwright
to
the
strategic
decision
relieves
counsel
of
the
traditional
responsibility
to
not
only
his
client,
but
to
the
court.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
state
v.
humphries
summed
it
up
very
succinctly
when
they
said
that
there
is
a
traditional
relationship
between
court
and
counsel
which
enjoins
upon
counsel
the
duty
to
raise
an
issue
before
the
court
rather
than
to,
by
its
silence,
lead
it
into
commission
of
error.
i'd
also
point
out
that
our
argument
does
depend
upon
the
ultimate
success
or
lack
of
success
in
raising
the
issue.
the
phrasing
in
wainwright
v.
sykes
is
that
if
a
person
thinks
that
the
actions
of
the
trial
court
are
about
to
deprive
it
of
constitutional
error,
then
he
has
a
duty
to
object.
not
that
he
knows
that
the
actions
of
the
trial
court
are
about
to
deprive
him
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
judge
poole's
dissenting
opinion
in
myers
v.
state
of
washington
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
because
i
think
he
very
succinctly
points
out
our
position.
he
refers
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
counsel
would
have
raised
the
question
as
a
murky
epistemology.
who
is
to
say
what
factor
will
set
off
the
creative
light
bulb
that
will
lead
to
new
development
in
the
law?
it
could
be
the
creation
of
a
new
statute,
it
could
be
a
development
in
another
state,
it
could
be
the
pendency
of
a
case
in
this
court.
it
could
be
any
one
of
numerous
factors,
and
i
think
that
if
you
apply
a
"would
have
raised"
you're
merely
stating
a
result
and
not
a
test.
it's
obvious
here
that
the
attorneys
did
not
object.
there's
no
explanation
offered
as
to
why,
and
there's
no
argument
made
that
they
could
not
have
raised
it.
i
think
our
distinction
flows
directly
from
wainwright
v.
sykes.
i
think
them
major
premise
of
that
decision
is
that
once
counsel
is
either
retained
or
appointed
for
a
criminal
defendant,
that
the
whole
range
of
strategic
and
tactical
decisions
is
entrusted
to
that
counsel.
i
also
think
that
the
result
is
fully
justified
by
the
state's
interest
in
finality.
there
comes
a
point
in
time
when
society
and
the
individual's
interest
in
finality
far
outweigh
any
possibility
of
enhanced
reliability
on
another
trial.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
well,
i
think
there
could
be
a
whole
range
of
circumstances
which
could
give
rise
to
the
conclusion
that
somebody
could
have
raised
a
particular
question.
i
don't
particularly
want
to
limit
it
to
a
clear
foreshadowing
by
a
prior
case,
though
that
certainly
fits
within
the
category
of
cases
that
i
would
consider
to
give
rise
to
a
situation
where
counsel
could
have
raised
it.
it
might
be
a
combination
of
cases,
as
opposed
to
on
particular
case.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
if
it
were
a
situation
in
which
counsel
could
have
raised
it,
yes.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
our
position
is
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
law
to
see
if
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
tried,
whether
or
not
a
competent
counsel
could
have
raised
the
question.
i
would
specifically,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
refer
to
brady
v.
the
united
states.
i
think
there
is
a
cogent
quote
there
to
the
extent
that
a
voluntary
plea
of
guilty
intelligently
entered,
in
light
of
the
law
in
existence
at
the
time,
does
not
become
vulnerable
simply
because
a
later
decision
makes
the
initial
premise
seem
faulty.
now,
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
waiver
was
of
the
person's
individual
rights,
but
it
was
done
at
the
advice
of
counsel.
the
premise
of
wainwright
is
that
with
respect
to
trial
type
decisions,
those
things
are
entrusted
to
counsel,
and
i
don't
see
why
there
should
be
a
distinction
in
the
question
of
waiver
between
the
guilty
plea
situation
and
the
situation
at
trial.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
an
example
might
help
to
illustrate
our
position
in
this
case.
assume
that
subsequent
to
leland
v.
oregon,
the
state
of
oregon
had
enacted
a
new
statute
which
was
later
interpreted
in
a
state
case
to
change
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
affirmative
defense
of
insanity
to
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
that
the
change
was
not
initially
seen
by
many
of
counsel
in
the
state
of
oregon...
you
had
a
somewhat
similar
situation
to
what
happened
here
in
ohio.
you
might
say
with
respect
to
the
instruction
that
was
given,
that
it
was
an
error
of
sate
law.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
it's
an
error
of
fundamental
justice
when
it's
the
same
instruction
which,
in
leland
v.
oregon,
was
held
to
not
violate
fundamental
fairness.
i
think
there's
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
a
decision
which
overcomes
a
defect
in
the
factfinding
process
as
opposed
to
one
which
creates
an
enhancement
of
the
factfinding
process,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
gosa
v.
mayden
in
which
the
court
refused
to
hold
o'callahan
v.
parker
retroactive.
the
state--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--the
difficulty
that
the
state
has
with
the
argument
that
if
the
state
creates
a
law
in
a
certain
fashion
that
it
must
apply
it
is
that
i
don't
see
where
you
draw
a
distinction--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--well,
i
understand
the
argument
from
the
appellate
court
to
have
been
that
once
ohio
passed
2901.05
that
they
created
an
element
of
the
crime
of
the
absence
of
the
affirmative
defense.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
justified
by
looking
at
ohio
law.
in
state
v.
poole,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
specifically
said
that
an
affirmative
defense
is
an
excuse
or
justification
usually
provable
for
the
most
part
through
the
plea
of
not
guilty,
which
is
collateral
to
the
elements
of
the
crime.
and
it
then
specifically
said
that
the
affirmative
defenses
in
ohio
are
insanity,
self
defense
and
duress.
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
if
i
may.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
if
it
were
an
element
of
the
crime,
yes.
but
i
think
that
under
patterson
v.
new
york,
the
state
may
make
the
absence
of
self-defense
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
the
ohio
court
has
specifically
held
that
it
is
a
true
affirmative
defense
which
has
no
necessary
relationship
to
the
elements
of
the
crime,
and
that
is
the
state
v.
poole
opinion,
which
is
not
even
cited
by
the
respondents.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
four
points
real
quickly.
one,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
specifically
said
in
state
v.
robinson
that
they
were
reaching
this
decision
on
the
basis
of
state
law.
i
think
the
questions
from
the
various
justices
point
out
that
if
it
is
a
question
of
state
law,
then
it
is
for
the
state
to
determine
how
far
it
is
going
to
apply
its
retroactivity.
now,
the
state
here
i
think
had
a
valid
reason
as
opposed
to
arbitrary
and
capricious,
as
called
by
the
appellate
court
for
not
making
this
applicable
to
those
who
had
not
objected,
and
that
is
that
the
result
in
this
case
is
absolutely
devastating
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
certainly,
a
number
of
persons
are
going
to
obtain
new
trials
as
a
result
of
the
holding
by
the
court
below.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
well,
two
things
on
that.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
that
is
correct.
that
was
a
function
of
the
fact
that
criminal
rule
30
did
not
apply
to
bench
trials.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
i
don't
see
anything
arbitrary
and
capricious
about
drawing
a--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--to
the
extent
that
those
cases
are
entitled
to
relief
under
ohio
law,
then
those
cases--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--i'm
sure
that's
correct,
your
honor.
one
aspect
of
finality
that
i
would
like
to
illustrate,
and
i
think
ohio
was
lucky
in
this
case
because
we're
dealing
with
a
relatively
short
time
period.
in
the
frady
case,
which
the
court
will
hear
next,
there
were
16
years
involved
between
the
time
of
the
initial
trial
and
the
finding
of
constitutional
error.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
there
is
not
in
this
particular
case.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
carter
decision
in
which
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
is
still
pending
in
the
appellate
court,
and
of
course,
they
relied
on
the
isaacs
case
for
finding
cause
in
the
failure
to
object
in
that
case,
and
it
could
apply
backwards.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
that
is
the
fact
that
mr.
hughes
and
mr.
isaac
have
actually
been
released,
and
i
think
that
illustrates
the
need
for
finality
in
the
system.
here
we
are
after
they
have
been
released
from
prison,
they
have
gone
back
to
their
jobs
or
whatever,
and
we
are
still
litigating
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
their
convictions
were
valid.
i
submit
that
is
a
result
that
should
not
be
allowed
under
our
system
of
justice.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
i'm
not
saying
that
the
question
is
technically
moot;
i'm
just
saying
that--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
the
state
would
retry
it,
nor
would
they
have
the
opportunity--
mr.
simon
b.
karas
--legally
they
could
be.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
predicate
for
n
expungement.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
probably
under
the
ohio
law
if
they're
a
first
offender.
mr.
simon
b.
karas
the
second
thing
is
that
mr.
aynes
has
referred
to
the
nature
of
the
claim.
i
think
that
is
what
gives
rise
to
the
court
of
appeals'
argument
about
presumed
prejudice,
and
the
only
point
that
i
would
make
there
is
a
quote
from
davis
v.
united
states.
"the
presumption
of
prejudice,
which
supports
the
existence
of
the
right,
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
holding
that
actual
prejudice
must
be
shown
in
order
to
obtain
relief
from
a
statutory
waiver
for
failure
to
assert
it
in
a
timely
manner.
"
the
third
thing
is
state
v.
abner
i
would
assert
actually
supports
the
state's
position.
the
court
there
held
that
there
need
not
be
a
specific
instruction
on
the
state's
burden
to
prove
the
absence
of
self-defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
argument
there
would
be
that
if
it
were
an
element
of
the
offense,
that
would
constitutionally
be
required.
the
only
counter-argument
that
the
respondents
have
made
is
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
acting
unconstitutionally
there
as
well.
and
the
last
thing
is
that
the
distinction
of
how
you
separate
the
claimed
state
error
here
from
any
other
claimed
state
error.
if
the
state
has
a
speedy
trial
act
that
is
more
restrictive
than
what
would
be
required
by
the
constitutional
claim
of
speedy
trial,
can
a
habeas
corpus
petitioner
raise
the
failure
of
ohio
to
have
abided
by
the
state
supreme
court
act,
the
state
speedy
trial
act
or
anything
other
of
the
myriad
range
of
decisions
by
which
state
courts
actually
go
beyond
what
is
fundamentally
required
by
the
constitution.
i
just
ask
the
court
to
note
that
the
hughes
case
provides
writ
granted
on
the
basis
of
isaacs;
i
expect
that
if
this
decision
is
upheld
you
will
have
writ
granted
isaacs,
writ
granted
isaacs,
and
i
have
asked
the
court
to
spare
the
state
of
ohio
this
tragedy.
