unknown
speaker
was
this
special
legislation
or
was
it
part
of
a
general--
unknown
speaker
what's
your
response,
counsel,
to
the
argument
that
up
until
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision
in
robinson
it
had
been
set
a
law
in
ohio
that
this
instruction
would
not
be
given?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
could
say
counsel
was
incompetent,
constitutionally
incompetent,
if
he
didn't
raise
it?
unknown
speaker
and
not
incompetent.
unknown
speaker
like
the
fellow
perceived
it
who
finally
raised
it
and
had
a
decision
on
it.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you're
suggesting
then
that
you
almost
need
to
have
a
spectrum
of
cases
in
order
to
make
an
assessment
of
cause
and
prejudice.
like
taylor
against
louisiana,
duren
against
missouri
and
lee
against
missouri,
one
of
which
foreshadows
a
development
or
at
least
suggests
that
there's
a
possibility
of
getting
the
argument
accepted
by
a
court.
the
second
of
which
represents
the
acceptance
by
the
court,
and
the
last
of
which
says
we
aren't
just
going
to
open
the
jail
doors
for
people
who
were
convicted
for
40
years.
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
even
if
a
state
supreme
court
has
said
the
instruction
should
never
be
given
just
the
day
before
a
trial,
the
counsel
should
have
raised
it
the
next
day
in
another
case.
unknown
speaker
well
yes,
he
could
have
raised
it,
and
he
could
always
ask
the
court
to
overrule
its
decision.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
general
karas,
do
you
concede
there
was
a
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
have
laws
retroactively
applied.
changes
in
the
law
retroactively
applied.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
the
question
a
little
differently.
what
do
you
understand
their
constitutional
claim
to
be?
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is
that
if
it
were
an
element
of
the
crime,
the
state
would
have
to
prove
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
ohio
court
said
it
was
an
element
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
because
in
a
bench
trial,
a
judge
doesn't
ordinarily
charge
himself?
unknown
speaker
indeed,
it
may
be
that
the
judge
might
really
bound
by
appellate
decisions,
and
juries
may
not
even
feel
that
way.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
though,
mr.
kingsley,
would
you
make
the
same
constitutional
claim
if
in
the...
whatever
decision
it
was
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
imposed
the
new
rule...
if
they
had
expressly
said
this
rule
should
be
prospective
only?
or
do
you
rely
entirely
on
the
equal
protection
concept?
unknown
speaker
they
construed
the
1974
statute
and
said
well,
it's
not
entirely
clear
in
the
statute
itself,
but
we
say
now
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecutor
to
negate
the
defense
of
self-defense.
say
they
had
done
that
in
1976
and
said
this
construction,
however,
will
only
apply
to
future
trials.
would
that
have
been
an
unconstitutional
action
of
the
state
of
ohio?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
ohio
court
says
the
prosecution
hereafter
is
going
to
have
to
prove
the
absence
of
self-defense,
but
that
we're
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
this
is
an
element
of
the
crime?
but
it's
just
a
state
rule
allocating
the
burden
of
proof
on--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
to
you
is
what
constitutional
violation
could
there
be
in
their
refusing
to
give
you
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
in
my
case,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
state
could
do
it
either
way.
insofar
as
any
constitutional
rule
is
concerned,
they
could
do
it
either
way.
they
could
either
put
the
burden
on
the
state
or
on
the
defendant
with
respect
to
self-defense.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
if
the
state
says
that
the
burden
hereafter...
the
burden
under
the
ohio
law
is
on
the
prosecution,
although
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime...
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
prove
the
absence
of
self-defense,
that
they
have
to
make
it
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
do--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
distinction
you're
talking
about
is
those
who
have
bench
trials
and
those
who
have
jury
trials.
unknown
speaker
and
the
distinction
follows
not
from
the
fact
that
they
have
selected
out
bench
trials
for
separate
treatment,
but
because
you
simply
don't
have
charges
to
the
judge
in
a
bench
trial.
unknown
speaker
so
if
there
are
two
parties
in
a
case
like
this;
one
had
a
bench
trial
and
one
had
a
jury
trial,
you
would
say
that
at
least
in
my
example
one
would
get
relief
and
the
other
would
not.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
person
on
the
bench
trial
wouldn't
get
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
you'd
only
have
to
object
to
those
rules
you
thought
maybe
some
day
somebody
would
think
the
instruction
was
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
true,
then
we
have
pretty
broad
collateral
attack.
because
you
can't
really
suggest
that
everything
the
judge
instructs
is
potentially
an
unconstitutional
instruction.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you're
saying
you
didn't
think
there
was
anything
unfair
about
the
rule
in
existence
at
the
time
you
tried
the
case.
unknown
speaker
defense
counsel
usually
are
sensitive
to
aspects
of
the
charge
that
tend
to
be
prejudicial
to
their
clients.
they
concentrate
on
those
things
and
object
to
those
things.
you
don't
have
to
object
to
everything.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
taught
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
the
last
word
on
federal
issues.
unknown
speaker
the
objection
in
griffin
against
california
never
would
have
been
made.
unknown
speaker
and
sometimes
lawyers
do
sense
things
that
lead
to
changes
in
the
law.
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
one
of
your
responses
to
i
think
justice
stevens'
question.
you
said
as
trial
counsel
when
this
situation
arose,
you
did
not
have
any
judgment
or
view
that
there
was
anything
inherently
unfair
about
what
was
taking
place.
unknown
speaker
even
though
there
were
decisions
which
would
have
supported
such
an
objection.
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever.
there
may
be
some
in
other
places,
too.
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
this
reaching
out
to
make
every
change
in
the
law
retroactive
may
put
a
damper
on
efforts
of
legislatures
and
judges
where
it's
within
the
power
of
judges
to
make
changes,
if
this
is
going
to
be...
if
200,
500,
600
people
are
going
to
have
the
benefit
of
some
change?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
can.
it
can
go
back
to
several
thousands.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kingsley,
would
you
agree
with
the
state
that
after
state
v.
robinson
and
under
state
v.
poole,
that
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
defense
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you
say
where
there's
fundamental
error
sykes
ought
not
to
apply.
what's
the
definition
of
fundamental
error?
unknown
speaker
you
really
are
submitting
that
if
the
ohio
supreme
court
imposes
a
rule
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
under
the
state
constitution
and
says
well,
we
understand
it's
not
required
by
the
federal
constitution,
and
if
that
rule
would,
in
your
words,
seriously
affect
the
accuracy
of
the
factfinding
process,
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
its
retroactivity?
that's
what
you're
suggesting.
i
suppose
i
hesitate,
your
honor,
only
because--
--well
isn't
that
what
your
argument
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
get
the
benefit
of
it...
must
you
get
the
benefit
of
it
under
the
federal
constitution,
even
though
your
case
was
tried
before
the
new
rule
was
put
in?
unknown
speaker
well,
changing
the
burden
of
proof
on
self-defense
didn't
result
from
any
federal
pressure,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
so
they
did
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
suggesting
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
you
have
the
benefit
of
that
ruling?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
change
was
in
state
law?
unknown
speaker
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
never
said
the
absence
of
self-defense
is
an
element
of
the
crime,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
they
just
said
the
state
has
to
prove
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
defense
claim...
if
defense
is
the
right
word...
in
leland
against
oregon,
was
in
the
nature
of
confession
and
avoidance
clearly,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white
two
questions
back,
equal
protection
was
the
route
by
which
you
get
to
your
position
when
it's
a
state
law,
not
a
federal
question
that
you're
relying
on.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
want
to
be
sure
about.
how
do
you
get
there
other
than
by
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
what
about
sunburst,
where
this
court
said
a
state
was
free
to
make
its
decision
prospective
only
or
retroactively
only.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
state
must,
under
our
federal
constitution,
provide
a
defense
of
self-defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
certainly
are
no
cases
from
this
court--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
your
constitutional
theory
for
just
a
second.
your
first
theory,
as
i
understand
it
was
that
if
the
ohio
supreme
court
changes
the
burden
of
proof,
it
must
make
the
new
rule
available
to
everyone
who
was
tried
after
the
statute
was
passed
in
1974.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
supposing
you
had
no
statute
at
all,
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
just
announced
a
new
rule
of
law
that
the
self-defense
burden
of
proof
shall
be
different
henceforth.
would
that
have
had
to
have
been
applied
retroactively?
unknown
speaker
why
do
they
have
to
apply
it
retroactively
when
it's
a
statutory
interpretation
and
not
when
it's
a
non-statutory
question?
unknown
speaker
all
the
people
who
had
bench
trials
are
going
to
get
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
the
court
said?
unknown
speaker
whatever
it's
a
function
of,
you're
going
to
have
a
class
of
convicted
defendants
who
are
going
to
get
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
there
was.
i
just
say
that
that
is...
part
of
the
devastating
impact
is
self-imposed.
unknown
speaker
there
is
certainly
more
than
one
of
them,
aren't
there?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
claim
here
that
it
goes
back
beyond
the
date
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
were
released,
they
would
have
to
be
retried?
unknown
speaker
will
they
have
to...
can
they
be
retried?
unknown
speaker
legally,
they
could
be...
they
could
be
lawfully
retried
now.
unknown
speaker
the
question
of
whether
you
can
find
your
witnesses
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
legal
issues.
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
habeas
corpus
court's
order
be
if
somebody
has
been
released?
either
retry
them
or
release
them,
or
they're
already
released?
unknown
speaker
either...
just
order
expungement,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
had
three
other
points
you
were
going
to
make?
