mr.
james
r.
kingsley
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
high
court:
ohio
unexpectedly
change
a
traditional
rule
that
the
defendant
had
to
prove
self-defense.
it
consciously
declared
that
change
be
retroactive.
in
my
opinion,
that
therefore
as
a
necessary
result
change
the
law
of
the
case
of
respondent
lincoln
isaac.
the
state
now
attempts
to
deny
lincoln
isaac
a
new
trial
because
he
failed
to
object
to
this
change
which
occurred
some
ten
months
after
his
trial.
because
criminal
rule
30
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
principle
of
retroactivity,
it
appears
that
imposition
of
this
contemporaneous
objection
rule
results
in
an
arbitrary
and
selected
denial
of
retroactive
benefits
to
some,
in
contravention
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
all
cases
after
january
1,
1974,
all
judges
and
all
juries
were
misinformed
as
to
who
had
to
prove
self-defense.
defendants,
who
were
found
guilty
by
misinformed
judges
were
permitted
new
trials
under
the
case
of
state
v.
myers.
that
judge
was
permitted
to
apply
the
same
facts
of
the
case
to
the
changed
law
with
the
possibility
of
a
changed
verdict.
however...
and
that
is
despite
counsel's
failure
to
object.
however,
those
defendants
who
were
found
guilty
by
misinformed
juries
were
not
granted
new
trials.
they
were
not
permitted
the
opportunity
to
apply
the
same
facts
to
the
changed
law
with
the
possible
result
of
a
changed
verdict.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
there
is
no
corresponding
criminal
rule
30
to
court
trials.
but
can
we
assume
that
the
judge
was
informed
of
the
proper
law?
he
instructed
the
jury
wrong.
obviously,
he
was
misinformed
in
both
cases.
he
thought
the
defendant
had
to
prove
self-defense.
why
is
there
not
a
corresponding
duty
on
counsel
to
tell
the
court,
as
a
trier
of
fact--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--i
would
trust
that's
not
a
precept
of
our
system,
but
that
may
be
a
reality.
[laughter]
in
any
event,
i
feel
there
is
no
basis
to
distinguish--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--no,
i
rely
upon
the
fact
that
if
the
state
of
ohio
wants
to
overrule
ivan
v.
new
york
and
hankerson,
they
wouldn't
have--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--and
without
the
cases
of
hankerson
and
ivan
v.
new
york,
my
personal
opinion
is
no.
the
state
has
the
right
to
declare
prospective
only.
the
major
premise
of
my
argument
is
that
once
they
make
the
conscious
decision,
it
must
be
applied
even-handedly
to
all
defendants
down
below.
because
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
difference
between
mrs.
myers
and
mr.
isaac
is
mr.
isaac
exercised
his
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
that
was
prejudiced.
now,
how
can
you
have
a
constitutional
distinction
and
the
only
difference
in
the
case
is
on
what
the
jury
trial...
that's
my
constitutional
right.
do
i
have
to
waive
my
constitutional
right
in
order
to
protect
myself
and
stop
going...
go
to
the
judge
as
opposed
to
the
jury?
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
subsequent
to
my
man's
trial?
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
would
it
be
retroactive?
is
that
the
question
to
me?
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
under
the
theory
of
ivan
v.
new
york,
if
in
fact
that
change
so
affected
the
entire
factfinding
process,
you're
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
indeed,
the
question
would
be,
did
that
change
so
affect
the
entire
trial
process
that
the
jury
was
misled
as
to
who
had
prove
what.
if
they
were--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--i
don't
disagree
with
you.
my
premise
is...
we're
starting
at
a
different
starting
point.
the
state
of
ohio
found
it
necessary
under
state
principles
to
make
it
retroactive.
not
constitutional
principles.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
if
they
do,
they
must
apply
it
even-handedly.
you
cannot
create
it
retroactively
and
treat
some
defendants
differently
to
others
when
they
are
in
the
same
factual
situation.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
correct.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
the
distinction
is
that
they
relied
upon
criminal
rule
30
saying
counsel
did
not
object.
the
classes...
there
is
only
one
class.
counsel
has
failed
to
object,
and
they
treated
all
those
people
in
that
class
of
failure
to
object
differently.
this
counsel
didn't
object,
she
got
a
new
trial.
this
counsel
didn't
object,
he
was
refused
a
new
trial.
the
class
is
counsel
had
failed
to
object--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--that's
exactly
what
happened
in
ohio.
and
i
say
there's
no
distinction,
except
that
i
demanded
my
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
the
person
in
ohio...
the
person
that
went
to
the
court,
the
bench
trial,
did
get
a
new
trial
under
state
v.
myers.
mrs.
myers
had
a
brand
new
trial
because
had
an
insanity
defense.
and
mr.
humphries
didn't.
there
are
additional
reasons
that
go
to
due
process
why
criminal
rule
30
is
not
related
to
retroactivity.
number
one,
the
purpose
of
retroactivity
is
emasculated.
if
the
state
of
ohio
found
to
be
retroactive,
that
necessarily
was
admitting
that
the
factfinding
process
was
faulty,
and
the
accuracy
of
the
verdict
was
questioned.
we
can't
let
defendants
remain
in
jail
if
we're
going
to
tell
them
that
their
verdict
may
be
in
error.
secondly,
it
requires
me
as
trial
counsel
to
object
to
everything,
to
all
the
parts
of
jury
instruction
regardless
of
legal
merit.
under
the
contemporaneous
objection
to
rules
of
evidence,
i
must
object
to--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--which
may
be
every
part
of
it.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
i
must
assume
that
as
trial
counsel
to
protect
my
client.
i
have
no
way
to
reserve
that.
i
didn't
think
in
this
trial
that
they
were
going
to
change
burden
of
proof.
i
thought
that
was
a
cornerstone
of
ohio
law
to
try--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--no
question
about
that.
it
was
not
unfair.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
well
basically,
i
saw
the
change
in
the
burden
of
proof
as
being
a
frivolous
legal
issue
because
it
was
solidly
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
and
do
i
object
and
tell
them...
do
i
come
back...
i
relied
upon
state
v.
rogers
which
was
decided
one
month
after
mullaney
and
three
months
before
my
trial.
and
in
fact,
what
happened
in
state
v.
rogers
was
they
construed
the
new
2905
statute
and
they
said
that
self-defense
is
on
the
defendant.
must
i
go
back
three
months
later
and
tell
the
supreme
court
that
they're
wrong?
or
can
i
rely
upon
i
see
it
this
way.
when
e.f.
hutton
speaks,
people
listen.
when
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
speaks,
i
listen.
i'm
taught
that
in
law
school.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
no.
and
i
raised--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
and
sometimes
it
incorporates
it.
notice
this
is
very
interesting
how
this
came
up,
because
one
raised
this
issue
in
ohio.
the
courts
found
it.
the
position
of
the
state
seems
to
be
that
the
purpose
of
criminal
rule
30
is
not
to
inform
the
trier
of
fact.
the
purpose
of
criminal
rule
30,
the
paramount
interest,
is
to
limit
the
defendant
to
one
day
in
court.
counsel
is
required
to
foresee
a
change
in
the
forged
at
a
trial
or
forever
be
barred.
now,
this
is
fair,
the
state
says,
because
all
counsel
are
not
created
equal.
those
that
are
able
will
raise
the
issue
and
will
receive
the
benefit.
the
poor
counsel
will
not
raise
it
and
their
counsel
will
be
barred.
in
this
particular
case,
the
counsel
that
raised
robinson,
mr.
tyack,
had
the
benefit
of
state
v.
matthews,
an
unreported
decision
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
robinson
decision.
he
didn't
raise
the
first
one
in
ohio.
obviously,
mr.
matthews
was
the
only
one
benefiting.
but
mr.
robinson's
counsel
got
that
decision.
in
the
state
v.
matthews,
defense
counsel
did
not
say
it's
unconstitutional.
defense
counsel
said...
the
state
raised
the
issue.
defense
counsel
said
if
you
raise
it,
you
prove
it.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
came
back
on
a
different
ground
saying
no,
the
burden
has
been
shifted.
so
here,
no
counsel
raised
the
issue,
the
court
sua
sponte
raised
the
issue,
and
mr.
robinson
got
the
benefit.
now
obviously,
mr.
robinson
and
mr.
humphries
seem
to
have
equal
counsel.
mrs.
myers
and
mrs.
humphries
had
equal
counsel,
because
neither
objected.
but
mrs.
myers'
counsel's
default
did
not
bind
her;
she
got
a
new
trial.
but
the
default
of
mr.
humphries'
counsel's
failure
to
object
bound
him,
did
not
get
a
new
trial.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
i
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
some
other
jurisdictions...
for
instance,
the
military
required
the
military
to
disprove
these
elements,
but
i
saw
an
ohio
state
decision
that
told
me
that
any
objection
i
was
going
to
make
would
be
futile
in
this
particular
case,
unless
i
was
going
to
change
the
law--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--in
the
military
law.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
i
do
not
disagree
with
that.
i
could
have
objected.
however,
they're
not
treating
counsel
equally,
either.
the
only
reason
i
should
object
is
there
is
a
case
down
there
i
should
have
seen
in
the
ohio
law.
there
was
no
case
in
the
ohio
law
and
the
major
treatises
in
the
decisions
anywhere.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
certified
as
an
instructor
and
i
was
training
counsel
to
talk
to
our
officers
on
this
case,
and
the
course
material
that
was
put
together
by
the
leading
scholars
in
ohio
didn't
say
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
was
referred
to
by
mr.
karas
here,
the
notes
of
the
committee,
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
legislative
notes
said,
we
are
going
to
change
the
language
specifically
and
say
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
persuasion.
and
they
struck
that
from
the
bill
and
they
left
it
the
same.
the
only
conclusion
could
be
was
that
they
did
not
intend
to
change
the
law
by
looking
at
this
enactment.
and
that's
exactly
what
i
assume.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
i
don't
think
it
has
to
go
back
that
far.
my--
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
--it
can,
but
i
don't
think
the
court's
or
other
changes
go
that
far.
i
raise
in
my
petition
that
those
counsel
that
foresaw
the
issue
and
got
into
the
courts
and
said
yes,
i
want
this
relief,
will
get
benefit.
three
counsel
that
i
can
see
so
far.
because
then
you've
cut
off
the
rights
of
retroactivity.
as
to
the
diligence
of
the
defendant...
if
he
didn't
see
that
change...
and
robinson
was
changed...
all
the
defendants
would
have
run
into
the
courthouse
and
said
that's
my
case.
they
didn't
do
that.
very
few
ran
into
the
courthouse
and
said
that.
therefore,
it's
their
fault
they're
not
going
to
get
the
relief
that
they
want.
let's
not
cut
it
off
at
factors
we
can't
control;
let's
cut
it
off
at
a
factor
where
the
criminal
defendant
can
control
it.
his
own
inadvertence
at
seeing
the
decision.
then
we
have
a
true
balance
struck.
we
have
relief
to
those
that
caught
it
and
asked
for
it
and
they're
not
getting
the
benefit
at
the
coattails
of
the
clients
who
did
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
logical
way
to
look
at
retroactivity
on
the
state
level
and
on
the
federal
level.
mr.
james
r.
kingsley
that
is
clearly
what
ohio
ruled
in
this
particular
case.
however,
it
did
not
say
that
my
client
still
had
to
prove
that.
my
client
is
still
required
to
prove
something
that
he
did
not
have
to
prove.
now,
the
crux
and
the
thing
that
bothers
me
about
this
case
is
that
i
raised
this
issue
22
months
after
this
thing
was
changed,
the
state
went
ahead
and
changed
it.
i
never
got
a
hearing.
thank
you.
