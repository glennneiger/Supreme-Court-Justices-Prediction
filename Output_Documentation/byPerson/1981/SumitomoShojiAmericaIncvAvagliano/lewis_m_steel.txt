mr.
lewis
m.
steel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
pick
up
this
argument
by
calling
to
your
honor's
attention
precisely
who
the
plaintiffs
are
and
what
the
class
is
that
they
seek
to
represent.
they
are
clerical
employees.
they
do
not
seek
to
be
president
of
sumitomo
america.
they
seek
to
move
up
in
an
orderly
fashion
through
training
programs
and
through
their
own
qualifications
at
this
point
in
time
to
the
lower
level
management
positions,
and
i
would
point
out
that
we
have
record
evidence
in
the
form
of
the
eeoc
reports
that
show
that
fully
40
percent
of
the
work
force
today
is
apparently
reserved
for
the
people
who
are
categorized
as
treaty
traders,
so
that
when
counsel
for
sumitomo
talks
about
high
level
executives,
in
reality,
he
is
talking
about
every
single
person
in
that
company
with
the
exception
of
a
few
white
males,
except
clericals,
so
that
we
have
a
real
live
issue
on
that
score
which
in
no
way
has
been
answered
by
the
pleadings,
and
must
be
answered
by
a
trial
on
the
merits.
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
are
presenting
here
two
propositions.
first,
we
claim
that
sumitomo
shoji
america
is
a
domestic
corporation,
and
therefore
it
has
no
rights
under
article
viii
of
the
treaty.
that
is,
the
of
their
choice
provision.
second,
we
claim
that
even
if
article
viii
were
to
apply
to
an
american
subsidiary,
then
the
of
their
choice
language
would
not
exempt
sumitomo
from
american
civil
rights
laws,
and
would
not
grant
it
a
license
to
discriminate.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
well,
i
see
many
differences.
one,
you
obviously
have
tax
differences
which
may
be
significant.
secondly--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--i
am
not
sure
i--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--no,
that
doesn't--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--well,
it
may
well
have
a
reason,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
it
may
well
have
an
important
reason.
there
may
well
be
some
advantages
which
have
not
been
developed
in
this
record
at
this
point
between
functioning
as
a
domestic
subsidiary
and
functioning
as
a
branch.
one
of
them
could
be
in
the
field
of
tax
secondly,
you
could
have
bankruptcy
questions.
thirdly,
you
could
have
questions
as
to
immunity
from
jurisdiction
of
suit.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
many
possibilities
why
a
patient
in
japan
might
well
choose
the
protection
of
using
a
corporate
form
here,
a
domestic
corporate
form
rather
than
appearing
in
this
country
as
a
branch,
and
i
think
that
some
of
those
have
been
developed
in
my
brief,
some
of
those
have
been
developed
and
alluded
to,
i
think,
in
both
the
government
brief
and
also
in
the
amicus
ajc
et
al.
brief,
and
i
think
those
well
could
be
significant,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
that
burden
of
trying
to
resolve
that
question
because,
contrary
to
counsel
for
sumitomo's
statement
that
the
treaty
is
ambiguous,
it
is
not
ambiguous
at
all.
section
22-3
has
a
precise
definition
and
precisely
states
that
companies
such
as
sumitomo
will
be
treated
as
american
corporations,
not
corporations
of
japan,
and
article
viii
within
the
article
refers
to
situations
involving
both
nationals
and
companies
of
japan
in
the
very
first
sentence,
which
discusses
the
viii
refers
to
a
situation
where
a
subsidiary
corporation
would
gain
certain
rights,
and
that
is
the
situation
where
accountants
and
other
experts
are
needed
by
the
subsidiary.
so,
you
start
out
here
in
your
analysis
by
looking
at
this
case
from
its
plain
language,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
do
that,
the
burden
is
really
on
sumitomo
to
overcome
a
very
clear
situation,
because
i
do
understand
there
are
cases
from
this
court
indicating
that
you
can
look
behind
plain
language,
but
certainly
plain
language
is
very
important.
certainly,
it
is
the
heavy
starting
point
for
analysis.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
well,
the
united
states
apparently
has
had
three
views,
and
it
has--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--yes,
your
honor,
but
it
started
out
with
a
view
that
by
a
attorney
advisor,
diane
wood...
i
don't
have
the
page
reference,
but
it
is
referred
to
in
the
brief...
saying
that
sumitomo
was
subject
to
jurisdiction.
that
is
when
eeoc
first
asked
the
state
department
for
its
opinion.
that
opinion
letter
was
then
withdrawn
by
mr.
marks,
who
promulgated
the
marks
letter,
and
then
the
marks
letter
was
withdrawn
when
the
atwood
letter
came
into
being,
but
there
is
a
very,
very
big
difference
between
the
atwood
letter
and
the
marks
letter.
marks
was
clearly
shooting
from
the
hip.
atwood,
on
the
other
hand,
clearly
stated
that
before
his
letter
was
promulgated,
the
state
department
had
carefully
reviewed
the
documents
in
question
and
the
negotiating
history.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
they
both
certainly
were
short,
your
honor,
but
when
you--
0
[generallaughter.]
that
is
cursory.
i
would
have
liked
from
mr.
atwood
more
detail.
i
agree
with
that.
but
you
see,
when
you
look
at
the
atwood
letter,
you
know,
as
we
know
now,
that
certain
documents
were
available
to
atwood
that
apparently
marks
didn't
consider.
for
example,
there
is
a
very,
very
long
communication
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief
relating
to
the
concept
of
subsidiaries
being
put
into
article
vi(4).
now,
you
have
a
back
and
forth
in
the
correspondence
between
japan
and
the
united
states
about
article
vi(4),
and
the
state
department
concludes
that
article
vi
the
way
it
was
originally
written
would
not
protect
subsidiaries
from
certain
problems,
namely,
expropriation.
in
order
to
ensure
that
subsidiaries
had
that
protection,
vi(4)
was
put
in,
which
put
into
that
section
the
concept
of
protecting
a
controlled
corporation.
so,
when
mr.
atwood
was
evaluating
the
treaty,
he
was
able
to
look
at
the
negotiating
documents,
which
made
clear
that
it
wasn't
accidental
as
to
which
sections
referred
to
controlled
corporations
and
which
sections
didn't.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
well,
he
did
say
that
he
had
it
available.
he
did
say
he
relied
on
it,
and
it
has
been
released.
we
can
certainly
assume
that
if
he
is
a
truthful
man,
he
evaluated
the
documents
that
he
released
to
the
parties,
including
this
very
significant
document.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
i
would
have
liked
more
reasoning
in
the
atwood
letter.
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
i
do
understand
that
it
may
be
entitled
to
less
weight
than
it
would
be
entitled
if
it
were
not
so
cursory.
i
do
agree
with
that.
but
if
you
look
at
the
timing
of
the
atwood
letter,
and
understand
what
atwood
had
before
him,
which
is
the
documents
we
all
have
before
us
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
letter
is
entitled
to
weight,
and
we
do
know
that
after
the
atwood
letter,
the
position
of
the
state
department
in
conformity
with
the
atwood
letter
was
communicated
to
the
government
of
denmark,
and
that
letter
is
also
in
the
record.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
major
argument
of
counsel
for
sumitomo.
even
though
i
believe
that
sumitomo,
given
the
plain
language
of
the
treaty,
has
the
burden
of
persuasion,
counsel
attempts
to
put
that
burden
on
us,
and
says,
we
have
not
shown
any
reason
whatsoever
for
the
distinction
between
branches
and
subsidiaries.
i
would
suggest
that
if
your
honors
look
at
the
section
in
our
brief
concerning
legislative
history,
which
is
the
section
involving
what
the
state
department
representatives
said
to
senator
hickenlooper
and
his
committee
when
this
treaty
and
the
series
of
treaties
in
1952
were
presented
to
that
body,
that...
those
questions
and
answers
and
those
statements
are
very
significant,
because
they
tell
us
what
we
all
know
from
understanding
our
history,
and
that
was,
back
in
1950,
and
throughout,
that
entire
period,
the
united
states
senate
was
very,
very
concerned
about
the
rights
of
americans
and
american
entities,
and
the
mood
of
the
senate
was
that
it
would
object
to
treaties
which
infringed
upon
american
sovereignty
at
home.
very
clearly,
the
state
department
representatives,
who
not
only
had
the
burden
of
convincing
foreign
governments
to
sign
treaties,
but
also
had
the
burden
of
convincing
the
senate
to
ratify
those
treaties,
was
trying
to
do
everything
that
it
could
possibly
do
to
let
the
senate
know
that
it
was
not
taking
away
from
either
the
federal
government
or
state
governments
their
traditional
powers
to
regulate
corporations.
and
if
we
have
to
speculate
as
to
why
people
would
make
that
type
of
distinction
between
branches
and
corporations,
we
have
the
dialogues
in
those
two
hearings
which
tell
us
very,
very
clearly
that
senator
hickenlooper
was
extremely
concerned
lest
this
treaty
would
take
away
the
traditional
rights
of
the
state
governments
to
regulate
corporations,
and
each
and
every
time
that
question
was
asked
of
state
department
representatives
over
a
period
of
two
years,
the
state
department
representative
made
clear
that
this
treaty
and
its
companion
treaties
would
take
nothing
away
from
the
states
to
regulate...
to
regulate
in
this
area.
now,
that
is
very,
very
significant,
because
in
1953,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
were
states
that
had
antidiscrimination
laws.
those
laws
were
in
effect,
and
it
is
clear
that
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
congress
or
of
the
senate
in
ratifying
these
treaties
to
in
any
way
infringe
upon
the
states
of
new
york,
where
sumitomo
is
incorporated,
to
enforce
its
law,
or
other
states.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
well,
let
me
say
this.
obviously,
the
state
of
new
york
is
not
in
the
same
situation
as
the
united
states
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
have
a
foreign
policy
to
consider,
but
very,
very
clearly
it
did
have
an
antidiscrimination
statute
on
its
books
which
meant
a
lot
to
it.
the
attorney
general
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
court.
and
more
importantly,
senator
hickenlooper
and
his
committee
was
very
concerned
that
these
treaties
would
not
erode
the
powers
of
the
states
to
regulate
domestic
corporations,
and
that
is
precisely
what
sumitomo
america
is,
and
i
suggest
if
we
have
to
look
for
an
answer
as
to
why
the
treaty
was
structured
in
this
way,
we
may
well
look
to
those
congressional
hearings.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
well,
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
to--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--yes,
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
that,
and
i
would
like
also
in
turning
my
attention
to
that
to
refer
to
the
senate
hearings
which
is
set
forth
on
page
23,
i
believe,
of
our
brief,
in
which
when
the
senate
was
considering
this,
the
state
department
representatives
said
that
the
treaty
rights
were
to
be,
and
i
quote,
"upon
as
favorable
terms",
and
let
me
stop
and
underline
that,
"upon
as
favorable
terms
as
the
nationals
of
the
country,
the
right
of
the
owner
to
manage
his
own
affairs
and
employ
personnel
of
his
own
choice.
"
now,
sumitomo
maintains
that
article
viii
sets
up
a
non-contingent
right,
that
it
is
an
absolute
right,
and
yet
the
state
department
representative
very
clearly
told
the
senate
committee
in
question
that
the
right
was
to
be
upon
as
favorable
terms
as
the
nationals
of
the
country.
that
is
a
contingent
right.
that
is
not
right
which
is
non-contingent,
because
it
must
be
the
same
right
as
is
available
to
nationals
at
home.
it
is
very
clear
that
the
employer...
that
the
employment
rights
in
this
treaty
are
national
rights,
are
national
treatment
rights,
and
not
rights
that
go
above
the
concept
of
national
treatment.
i
would
like
therefore
to
suggest
that
at
the
point
in
time
that
this
treaty
was
passed,
it
was
perfectly
appropriate
for
congress
to
pass
title
vii
and
not
have
that
statute
be
in
conflict
with
this
particular
treaty.
more
than
that,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
parties
could
have
contemplated
the
passage
of
title
vii,
because
of
the
u.n.
charter
provisions
which
are
in
our
brief
and
concepts
of
equality
which
were
developing
at
that
point
in
time.
secondly,
i
point
out
that
title
vii
has
specific
exemptions.
congress
well
understood,
and
i
have
a
section
in
my
brief
about
that,
that
it
could
exempt
certain
areas
from
title
vii
protection,
and
in
fact
did
so,
and
did
so
in
two
areas
relating
to
foreign
policy,
and
those
sections
are
also
set
forth
in
my
brief.
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
about
the
government.
i
believe
that
its
brief
in
which
it
wonders
whether
or
not
article
viii
constitutes
a
legislative
type
validation
for
the
top
jobs,
i
suggest
that
that
is
entirely
an
unnecessary
approach
to
take,
precisely
because
the
business
necessity
concept
under
title
vii
would
give
sumitomo
all
the
protection
that
it
needs
there,
and
you
must
remember
when
you
are
talking
about
top
jobs,
business
necessity
becomes
a
very
potent
weapon.
it
is
rather
difficult
for
a
plaintiff
to
overcome
business
necessity
at
the
top
levels
where
the
employer
says,
i
need
in
this--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--absolutely
not.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
right,
and
i
don't
believe
the
government
says
that.
it
wonders
as
to
whether
or
not
in
the
future
it
may
take
that
position,
but
i
think
the
treaty
trader
exception...
excuse
me,
the
business
necessity
approach
carefully
and
would
completely
take
care
of
that
problem.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
with
regard
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
argument
that
has
been
made
by
sumitomo
the
following.
it
strikes
me
that
the
ina
and
its
supporting
regulations
do
not
meet
the
issues
here
for
at
least
three
reasons.
one,
those
regulations
and
that
statute
involve
individual
rights,
the
individual
who
wants
to
come
into
the
country.
they
do
not
involve
corporate
rights.
they
do
not
involve
the
right
of
a
corporation,
but
instead
the
right
of
the
individual
who
applies
to
come
in
as
a
treaty
trader.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
well,
i
am
not
sure
which
one
you
are
talking--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--well,
i
think
the
main
issue
that
is
certainly
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
sumitomo
is
exempt
from
title
vii
strictures--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--and
i
think
that
there
are
a
series
of
arguments
that
have
been
made
by--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--well,
that's
right,
and
counsel
for
sumitomo
tries
to
extend
that
and
say
by
virtue
of
ina,
and
by
virtue
of
those
regulations
under--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--well,
this
case
has
now
been
going
on
since
1977.
this
is
a
civil
rights
case.
we
would
like
to
get
going
with
it.
we
would
be
most
appreciative
to
have
the
guidance
of
this
court
so
that
we
can
get
going
with
it,
and--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--i
would
rather
lose
it
now
than
lose
it
five
years
from
now,
and
frankly,
i
don't
think
we
are
going
to
lose
it.
i
am
hopeful
we
won't.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
one
person
at
present
is
an
employee.
another
person
has
filed
an
eeoc
charge
in
the
recent
months.
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
okay,
i
had
two
more
points
under
the
ina,
but
let
me
just
say
them
briefly.
one
is,
you
have
to--
mr.
lewis
m.
steel
--okay.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
