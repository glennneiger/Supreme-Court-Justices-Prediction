mr.
abram
chayes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
international
obligations
of
the
united
states
under
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce,
and
navigation
with
japan
and
similar
treaties
with
many
other
countries,
an
obligation
to
permit
a
foreign
investor
to
manage
and
control
its
investment
in
this
country
by
engaging
executives
and
other
specialists
of
its
choice.
sumitomo
shoji
america
is
a
company
organized
and
existing
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
sumitomo
japan,
a
general
trading
company
or
sogo
shoji,
with
more
than
100
offices
around
the
world.
plaintiffs
below
are
women
who
are
or
were
employed
as
secretaries
by
sumitomo.
they
brought
suit
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
alleging
two
principal
causes
of
action.
first,
in
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint,
they
allege
that
sumitomo
discriminated
against
them
by
restricting
them
to
clerical
positions
on
the
ground
that
they
were
women,
and
second,
in
paragraph
13,
that
sumitomo
had
discriminated
against
them
by
restricting
them
to
clerical
positions
on
the
ground
of
their
nationality.
sumitomo
answered
denying
the
claims
of
discrimination
and
asserting
that
its
employment
practices
challenged
in
the
complaint
were
authorized
by
the
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
treaty,
and
on
this
basis
sumitomo
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
district
court
denied
this
motion,
holding
that
sumitomo
as
a
new
york
company
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
treaty.
that
question
was
certified
for
interlocutory
appeal
under
section
1292(b)
of
the
judicial
code.
on
the
issue
certified,
the
second
circuit
reversed
the
district
court.
it
held,
as
did
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
substantially
identical
case,
spiess
versus
c.
itoh,
incorporated,
that
a
wholly
owned
u.s.
subsidiary
of
a
japanese
investor
could
indeed
invoke
the
protection
of
the
treaty,
but
contrary
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
second
circuit
went
on
to
hold
that
on
the
merits
the
treaty
did
not
preclude
examination
under
title
vii
of
sumitomo's
employment
practices
with
respect
to
senior
personnel.
on
this
ground,
it
affirmed
the
district
court's
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
we
took
our
petition
for
certiorari
from
that
decision.
now,
i
want
to
go
directly
to
the
treaty
issues
that
i
think
are
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
indeed
in
my
view,
the
deeper
question
of
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
will
faithfully
carry
out
treaty
obligations
undertaken
with
two
dozen
foreign
countries,
obligations
that
it
placed
in
the
treaty
and
placed
in
the
treaty
for
its
own
purposes.
there
are
two
issues
under
the
treaty,
two
components
to
the
treaty
question.
the
first
is
who
may
invoke
the
employment
right
under
the
treaty,
and
the
second
is
what
is
the
scope
of
that
right.
as
to
the
first,
who
may
invoke
the
right,
i
think
that
need
not
detain
us
long.
both
courts
of
appeals
decided
that
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
a
foreign
investor
was
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
employment
right.
and
why?
because
neither
court
of
appeals
could
perceive
any
sound
reason
or
basis
in
policy
for
distinguishing
in
terms
of
the
employment
right
between
foreign
investment
carried
out
through
a
branch
and
foreign
investment
carried
out
through
a
locally
organized
subsidiary.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
that
is
true.
that
is
our...
our
position
is
that
the
foreign
investor
has
a
right
to
manage
and
control
his
investment
in
the
united
states
by
engaging
executive
personnel
of
his
choice,
and
if
his
investment
is...
takes
the
form
of
a
subsidiary
of
a
subsidiary,
the
answer
is
the
same.
mr.
abram
chayes
fifty-five
percent
wouldn't
bother
me.
the
regulations--
mr.
abram
chayes
--well,
the
regulations
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
provide
and
have
provided
always
that
a
51-percent
controlled
subsidiary
has
the
nationality
of
the
state
of
its
owner.
if
you
go
below
that,
below
51
percent,
then
you
are
not
talking
about
a
controlled
subsidiary,
and
it
is
the
right
to
control
and
manage
the
investment
that
is
at
stake.
if
you
look
at
article
vii
of
the
treaty,
article
vii
says
that
the
foreign
investor
has
the
right
to
invest
in
this
country
in
any
lawful
juridical
form.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
it
is
hard
to
say--
mr.
abram
chayes
--yes.
i
was
going
to
say,
it
is
hard
to
say
in
whose
behalf
the
brief
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
was
filed,
because--
mr.
abram
chayes
--yes,
or
whom
it
supports.
0
[generallaughter.]
it
seems
to
be
that
the
brief
discloses
a
compromise
between
various
points
of
view
in
the
government,
and
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
say
on
this
branch
of
the
case.
the
essential
point
is,
there
should
not
be
distinction
as
between
branch
investment
and
subsidiary
investment.
nobody
has
been
able
to
adduce
a
reason
why
one
should
distinguish
between
investment
carried
out
through
branches
or
investment
carried
out
through
subsidiaries.
on
the
contrary,
the
major
objective
of
these
treaties,
post-world
war
two
treaties,
was
to
accommodate
investment
through
locally
incorporated
subsidiaries.
that
was
a
new
element
in
1952,
although
already
quite
popular.
by
now,
it
is
the
predominant
form
of
overseas
investment.
in
the
united
states,
85
percent
of
our
direct
investment
abroad
takes
the
form
of
locally
incorporated
subsidiaries.
that
is
why
the
state
department
said,
the
same
state
department,
justice
white--
mr.
abram
chayes
--well,
i
am
going
to
suggest
that
in
a
moment--
0
[generallaughter.]
--but
i
want
to
say
that
as
late
as
july,
1979,
the
state
department
said
that
an
interpretation
of
the
treaty
that
would
exclude
locally
incorporated
subsidiaries
would
gut
the
treaty
of
much
of
its
value
for
the
united
states.
now,
that
is
colorful
language
for
the
state
department.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
now
i
think
what
the
state
department
says
now
is
a
little
bit
different.
it
says
this.
it
says,
we
don't
want
to
call
the
locally
incorporated
subsidiary
a
company
of
japan
for
the
purposes
of
article
viii.
it
says,
we
don't
want
for
the
purposes
of
article
viii
to
pierce
the
corporate
veil.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
of
course,
the
subsidiary
is
a
corporation.
it
has
limited
liability.
it
is
taxed
as
a
separate
entity,
and
so
on.
the
branch
is
a
part
of
the
foreign
enterprise,
and
it
does
not
have
limited
liability.
it
is
a
presence
in
this
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
enterprise,
and
so
on.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
think
there
are
no
differences
for
the
purposes
we
are
here
today.
mr.
abram
chayes
functionally,
none,
and--
mr.
abram
chayes
--well,
yes,
but
not
for
the
purposes
of
employment,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
article
vii-c,
it
says,
first,
the
foreign
investor
may
establish
branches.
that
is
vii-1-a.
vii-1-b
says
it
may
establish
locally
incorporated
subsidiaries,
and
then
vii-1-c
says,
it
may
manage
and
control
its
enterprises
without
distinguishing
at
all
between
them.
now,
i
want
to
say...
i
want
to
return
to
justice
white's
question,
because
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
see
that
although
the
state
department
doesn't
want
to
call
us
the
company
of
japan
for
the
purposes
of
article
viii,
it
is
perfectly
willing
that
we
should
have
the
benefits
of
article
viii
protection
derivatively,
so
to
speak,
through
the
right
of
our
parent.
if
you
look
at
page
6
of
the
brief
of
the
united
states
in
its
summary
of
argument,
it
says
that
in
so
many
words.
accordingly,
it
says,
as
a
wholly
japanese
owned
trading
company,
sumitomo
may
continue
to
obtain
the
services
of
japanese
nationals
to
the
extent
they
qualify
for
treaty
trade
or
visas
under
the
standards
described
above
even
if
the
court
concludes
that
sumitomo
is
not
a
company
of
japan
that
may
invoke
the
special
employment
privileges
of
the
treaty,
and
you
will
find
similar
expressions
scattered
throughout
the
state
department's
brief,
wherever
one
side
or
the
other
won
the
particular
negotiating
battle.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
would
not
at
all,
sir.
i
would
say
that
that...
we
are
perfectly
prepared
that
this
court
should
decide
that
we
are
a
company
of
japan
for
the
purposes
of
article
viii,
or
that
we
get
the
right
derivatively
from
the
right
of
the
parent.
we
have
no
vested
interest
in
which
rationale
the
court
uses
to
reach
that
result,
and
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
the
courts
below
apparently
look
both
ways
on
the
question
of
rationale,
and
they
do
so
for
the
very
reason
you
say,
your
honor,
because
functionally
there
is
no
difference.
functionally,
the
right
of
the
foreign
investor
to
manage
and
control
has
got
to
be
the
same
and
was
designed
to
be
the
same
in
this
treaty,
whether
his
investment
took
the
form
of
a
branch
or
of
a
subsidiary.
now,
i
would
like,
therefore,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
abram
chayes
--well,
that,
as
you
see
from
the
briefs,
is
the
subject
of
a
lot
of
scholastic
exegesis.
i
think
that
it
performs
a
function
that
has
not
been
very
fully
called
to
our
attention,
and
that
is
this.
think
article
xxii
was
really
designed
to
say
what
companies
of...
what
kinds
of
enterprises
or
entities
in
the
foreign
country
did
we
have
to
recognize,
and
conversely,
what
kinds
of
entities
in
our
country
did
the
japanese
have
to
recognize,
and
all
this
talk
about
a
single
simple
case
is
not
a
test
about
the
nationality
of
the
company.
it
is
really
a
test
about
what
kind
of
entity
in
the
foreign
milieu
we
have
to
recognize
as
a
company,
and
the
reason
why
this
article
was
drafted
in
these
terms
was
that
previously,
previously
in
the
u.s.
treaties
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
with
germany,
for
example,
or
with
japan,
the
treaties
in
the
19
teens
and
the
twenties,
a
whole
series
of
requirements
were
established
before
a
company
could
claim
recognition
by
the
other
party.
it
had
not
be
not
only
organized
within
the
territory
of
one
party,
but
have
its
seat
there,
and
so
on,
if
you
look
at
the
german
treaty
or
the
japanese
treaty.
and
so
they
said,
now
let's
sweep
all
that
aside.
let's
have
a
simple
test
that
tells
me
when
i
have
to
recognize
a
japanese
enterprise,
and
tells
the
japanese
when
they
have
to
recognize
my
enterprise,
and
that
is
when
it
is
incorporated
in
the
other
party's...
it
is
organized
under
the
other
party's
laws.
it
has
little
or
nothing
to
do,
i
think,
mr.
justice
stevens,
with
what
we
have
to
do
about
companies
organized
under
our
own
laws.
but
even
if
you
take
that
view,
then
it
seems
to
me,
as
i
said
before,
it
may
be
that
the
state
department
has
some
concerns
about
calling
a
company
organized
under
the
united
states,
a
viii,
because
that
may
have
a
carry-over,
a
carry-over
effect
in
other
parts
of
the
treaty,
but
in
fact,
the
state
department
says,
you
can
get
there
by
a
different
route.
all
you
have
to
say
is,
it
is
the
parent
that
is--
mr.
abram
chayes
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
abram
chayes
no.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
sir.
i
think
they
say,
again,
if
you
want
to
look
at
another
example,
the
government's
brief
at
page,
i
think,
21,
"because
sumitomo's
parent
corporation"...
i
am
reading
now
down
at
the
bottom...
"apparently
is
a
company
of
japan--
"
mr.
abram
chayes
--down
at
the
bottom
of
the
government's
brief
at
page
21,
sir.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes.
and
it
says,
"apparently
a
company
of
japan".
i
don't
think
there
is
anybody
who
denies
that
sumitomo
japan
is
a
company
of
japan.
"the
parent
might
well
have
discretion
protected
by
the
treaty
to
select
japanese
nationals
for
certain
top
level
managerial
positions
in
sumitomo
through
the
exercise
of
the
parent's
right
under
article
xiii-1
to
engage
executive
personnel.
"
in
other
words,
that
is--
mr.
abram
chayes
--we
don't
claim
that
we
don't...
that
we
have
the
right
to
engage
anything
other
than
executive
personnel
and
the
other
categories
mentioned
in
article
viii
of
the
treaty,
and
if
i
could--
mr.
abram
chayes
--well,
if
i
could,
mr.
justice,
to
go
the--
mr.
abram
chayes
--that's
right.
i
want
to
talk
about
what
the
scope
of
the
treaty
right
is,
because
i
honestly
think
there
isn't
much
substance
to
the
argument
that
whatever
the
treaty
right
is,
this
company
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
it.
and
in
talking
about
the
scope
of
the
treaty
right,
i
want
to
make
two
points.
first,
sumitomo
is
not
claiming
a
general
immunity
from
title
vii.
we
are
speaking
only
of
a
narrow
group
of
top
executives
and
specialists
necessary
to
manage
and
control
the
investment,
and
second,
i
think
it
is
essential
to
keep
in
mind
that
these
employment
rights
were
put
in
the
treaty
not
by
the
japanese,
not
by
the
germans,
not
by
the
danish,
not
by
the
israelis,
but
by
the
united
states.
we
were
the
draftsmen
of
this
treaty,
and
what
we
wanted
out
of
article
viii
of
this
treaty
is
also
stated
in
the
government's
brief.
it
appears
in
footnote
14
at
page
24-25,
and
what
we
wanted
was,
it
says,
the
purpose
of
article
viii
was
to
override
these
restrictions,
host
country
restrictions
on
employment
of
aliens,
and
i
am
quoting
now,
"so
that
american
businessmen
operating
abroad
would
be
able
to
select
u.s.
nationals
for
essential
positions.
"
and
that
is
the
right
that
sumitomo
is
seeking.
now,
to
define
the
scope
of
that
right,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
government
in
sort
of
general
terms
accepts
that
statement
of
what
the
right
is,
but
then
they
say,
oh,
well,
on
this
record
we
can't
say
that
all
these
people
that
occupy
challenged
positions
are
really
executive
personnel,
are
really
specialists
of
the
kind
mentioned
in
the
treaty,
so
we
have
got
to
send
the
whole
thing
back
for
a
case
by
case
examination
of
what
these
executive
positions
amount
to
and
what
these
specialist
positions
amount
to.
your
honors,
we
believe
that
that
question
can
be
settled
as
a
matter
of
law
on
this
record
by
this
court,
and
it
can
be
settled
if
we
expand
our
horizon
a
little
bit
and
take
into
account
additional
legal
materials
that
are
not
referred
to
by
the
government,
and
essentially
the
legal
materials
involved
are
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
of
1952
and
the
regulations
thereunder.
now--
mr.
abram
chayes
--surely.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
it
is
executive
personnel,
attorneys,
agents,
and
other
specialists
of
their
choice.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
let
me
say
that
if
we
had
nothing
but
the
treaty
to
go
on,
that
would
be
a
fair
or
a
possible
reading,
but
we
do
have
more
than
the
treaty
to
go
on,
and
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
bring
into
the
picture
right
now.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
do
not,
and
i
am
saying
that
on
the
face...
we
don't
have
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
face
of
the
treaty,
because
we've
got
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act,
which
was
passed
at
the
same
time,
contemporaneously.
section
101(a)(15)(e)
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
was
the
part
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
designed
to
carry
out
these
provisions
of
the
treaty,
and
if
you
look
at
that
section
of
the
act
and
the
regulations
promulgated
thereunder,
they
evidence
contemporaneous
and
continuous
congressional
understanding
of
what
the
scope
of
that
right
was,
and
administrative
understanding
of
what
the
scope
of
the
right
was.
mr.
abram
chayes
the
entire
treaty
right.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
all
right.
i
think
it
is
the
right
that
we
are
claiming.
that
is
what
we
are
claiming.
we
are
claiming--
mr.
abram
chayes
--we
are
claiming
executives
of
their
choice,
and
we
are
saying
the
scope
of
that
right
is
defined.
we
don't
have
to
sort
of
look
at
the
ceiling
and
say,
is
it
top,
or
low,
or
what.
the
scope
of
that
right
is
defined
by
the
contemporaneous
congressional
expression
of
the
ina
and
the
contemporaneous
and
continuous
administrative
expression
of
the
regulations.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
treaty
construction,
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
we
can
use
the
contemporaneous
statute
by
which
the
congress
attempted
to
carry
out
u.s.
treaty
obligations,
and
the
regulations
thereunder,
as
defining
the
treaty
right,
as
defining
what
the
treaty
means,
and
if
you
look
at
those,
you
will
see
that
the
act
says
that
to
get
a
treaty
trader
visa,
an
e-1
visa,
you
must
be
an
alien
entitled
to
enter
pursuant
to
a
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation,
and
a
national
of
the
state
under
which
the
treaty...
under
whose
treaty
you
claim.
so
that
that
means
our
right
of
free
choice
is
limited
at
the
outset
to
nationals
of
our
own
country,
that
is,
japanese
nationals
in
the
case
of
japanese
investments
in
the
united
states,
u.s.
nationals
in
the
case
of
u.s.
investment
abroad.
that
is
exactly
what
we
wanted,
the
right
to
put
u.s.
nationals
in
our
management
positions
abroad.
then,
if
you
look
at
the
regulations,
you
see
that
there
are
further
criteria
defining
the
scope
of
this
treaty
right.
the
regulations,
which
appear
in
our
brief,
i
think,
at
page
6,
talk
about
executive
and
supervisory
positions
on
the
one
hand,
and
specialist
positions
on
the
other,
where
the
qualifications
are
essential
to
carrying
on
the
investment's
activities,
the
activities
of
the
enterprise.
yes,
sir?
mr.
abram
chayes
i
think
there
were
regulations
promulgated
at
the
time
of
the
statute.
yes,
your
honor.
they
have
been
clarified,
as
appears
in
the
footnote
of
our
brief
at
that
point.
i
think
it
is
in
the
reply
brief,
perhaps,
at
footnote...
well,
i
think
it
may
be
9
or
10
of
the
reply
brief...
footnote
11
of
the
reply
brief.
no,
i'm
sorry.
it
was
footnote
9,
but
it
appears
at
page
11.
and
it
shows
you
the
historic
evolution
of
those
regulations.
i
think
they
amount
to
a
continuous...
a
continuous
administrative
interpretation
that
is
of
much
more
interest
here
than
the
sort
of
back
and
forth
badminton
game
that
the
letterwriters
in
the
state
department
played
with
each
other.
here
is
the
way
the
united
states
construed
this
treaty
when
they
had
to
administer
it.
now,
if
you
go
further
beyond
the
regulations
you
will
see
that
there
are
interpretative
notes,
and
as
you
look
at
the
government's
brief,
the
interpretative
directions
are
provided
in
the
government's
brief
at
appendix
b-a,
i
think,
and
at
page
3-a
of
the
government's
brief,
you
will
see
what
it
says
about
executives,
and
it
says
they
do
have
to
be
top
executives
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
visa,
with
important
supervisory
functions,
and
you
will
see
what
it
says
about
specialists
at
page
6-a
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
it
is
more
than
that,
even,
your
honor.
these
general
trading
companies
are
a
very
special
kind
of
organization.
these
employees
have
been
recruited
after
college,
and
they
stay
in
this
company
for
their
lives,
for
the
most
part.
they
are
like
a
civil
service,
or
even
a
foreign
service.
they
serve
in
the
japanese
office
for
a
while.
then
they
are
sent
overseas
to
the
american
office.
then
they
come
back
to
japan,
and
go
out
again
to
the
office
in
germany
perhaps.
these
are
part
of...
these
people
are
part
of
this
company.
that's
their
lives,
is
to
be
part
of
this
company.
now,
i
want
to
say
just
one
word
about
why
we
still
shouldn't
go
back
and
find
out
whether
these
regulations
and
laws
have
been
accurately
applied.
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
to
go
back
and
decide
whether
these
positions
were
truly
executive
positions,
and
whether
the
person
truly
had
these
qualifications,
would
be
in
fact
to
review
the
consular
officer's
decision,
and
that
is
something
this
court
has
never
permitted.
mr.
abram
chayes
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
abram
chayes
they
might
agree
to--
mr.
abram
chayes
--should
not
be
reviewed.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
they
would.
i
think
they
would,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
abram
chayes
and
i
think
people
who
have
had
responsibility
in
the
justice
department
understand--
mr.
abram
chayes
--thank
you,
sir.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
think
they
understand
how
important
it
is
to
preserve
this
immunity
from
review
of
the
consular
officer's
visa
decision.
mr.
abram
chayes
there
is
no
supreme
court
case
which
states
that
the...
which
decides
the
point
exactly.
there
are
legion
of
supreme
court
cases
that
say
that
these
issues
are
committed
to
executive
and
legislative
discretion,
to
the
political
branch--
mr.
abram
chayes
--our
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
it
has
been
determined
by
the
consular
officer
that
they
do
qualify
under
the
treaty.
now
you
say,
well,
why
shouldn't
we
review
that
determination
just
like
we
review
all
sorts
of
administrative
determinations,
and
the
answer
is
that
consular
determinations
on
visa
issues
have
always
been
held
immune
to
review.
why?
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
our
position,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
our
right
extends
to
people
whom
we
have
been
able
to
convince,
the
consular
officer
under
the
state
department
regulations
and
the
ina
to
issue
an
e-1
visa.
that
is
why
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
and
that
the
determination
ought
not
to
be
reviewed,
not
because
it
wouldn't
be
a
nice
thing
to
have
a
review
of
this
administrative
determination,
but
because
for
other
reasons
having
to
do
with
the
integrity
of
the
administration
of
the
immigration
laws,
this
court
has
continuously
refused
to
subject
those
determinations
to
review.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
it
is
that,
sir,
that--
mr.
abram
chayes
--mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the
treaty,
which
might
be
ambiguous
on
its
face,
is
defined
in
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
that
was
passed
to
implement
it,
and
in
the
regulations
thereunder,
and
all
those
issues
are
determined
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
the
only
possible
argument,
as
i
suggested,
is
that
we
ought
to
review
the
consular
officer's
determination.
it
ought
to
be
entitled
to
some
kind
of
judicial
review.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
that
this
court
has
been
very
careful,
i
would
say,
has
never
permitted
the
review
of
consular
officer's
determinations
because
the
administration
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
and
the
immigration
laws
of
the
united
states
has
been
held
to
be
a
paramount
political--
mr.
abram
chayes
--well,
our
reply
to
that
is
quite
different.
we
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
executives
of
our
choice...
i
am
sorry,
i
will
have
to
answer
your
question...
as
long
as
we
have
somebody
we
want
to
put
there
and
we
can
get
an
e-1
visa
for
him.
if
we
take
him
out
of
there
and
don't
substitute
another
person
with
an
e-1
visa,
our
belief
is
that
that
position
is
then
subject
to
the
title
vii
laws.
that
is,
the
only
right
that
we
have
is
to
get
visas
for
people
entitled
to
enter
under
the
treaty.
that
is
what
the
laws
says,
entitled
to
enter
under
the
treaty.
they
must
be
entitled
to
enter
under
the
treaty,
and
there
is
no
way
they
can
be
entitled
if
they
don't
fall
within
this
category,
and
once
we
do,
that
choice
is
foreclosed,
but
if
we
don't,
title
vii
applies
just
as
it
always
does.
i
am
sorry
to
have
gone
over--
mr.
abram
chayes
--yes,
she
was,
your
honor.
we...
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
we
conceded,
and
it
appears
in
our
reply
brief,
that
as
to
that
person,
the
japanese
national,
who
was
a
plaintiff,
female
japanese
national,
she
might
have
a
claim
that
withstands
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
on
the
other
hand...
and
so
that
concession
stands
in
the
record,
and,
i
think,
meets
your
question,
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
are
talking
about
executive
personnel
of
their
choice,
and
you
are
talking
about
how
a
japanese
company
manages
its
top
executives
worldwide,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
court
might
wish
to
hesitate
before
it
imposed
our
notions,
to
which
i
subscribe
wholeheartedly,
of
non-discrimination,
on
decisions
taken
by
japanese
companies
in
japan
to
send
people
to
the
united
states,
but
that
is
by
the
side.
the
main
answer
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
we
have
conceded
that
as
to
her,
a
claim
that
is
proof
against
12(d)(6)
has
been
stated.
again,
pardon
me
for
carrying
beyond
the
allotted
time.
