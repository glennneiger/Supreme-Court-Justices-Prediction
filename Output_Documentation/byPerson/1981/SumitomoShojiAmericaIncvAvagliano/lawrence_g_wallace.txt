mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
view
of
the
united
states,
the
dispositive
issue
before
this
court
at
the
present
stage
of
the
case
is
whether
the
special
employment
privilege
of
article
viii
is
conferred
on
a
subsidiary
incorporated
in
the
host
country,
such
as
the
petitioner.
the
answer
given
by
the
treaty's
text
is
that
that
privilege
is
not
conferred
on
such
a
subsidiary,
and
the
contracting
parties
to
the
treaty
are
in
agreement
that
the
textual
answer
is
the
correct
one,
that
the
treaty
means
what
it
says
in
this
regard.
now,
the
court
has
noted
that
the
views
of
the
contracting
parties
to
a
treaty
are
entitled
to
great
weight,
and
i
think
that
principle
applies
particularly
when
we
are
talking
about
the
interpretation
of
a
provision
that
is
obviously
meant
to
impose
reciprocal
obligations
because
it
is
only
by
a
decision
agreeing
with
the
views
of
the
contracting
parties
that
the
actual
application
of
the
reciprocal
obligation
can
be
assured,
and
otherwise,
there
is
some
question
introduced
that
will
cause
questions
to
be
resolved
in
our
international
relations
of
whether
reciprocity
can
be
preserved
if
the
views
of
the
contracting
parties
are
determined
not
to
be
the
correct
views.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
one
thing
that
we
have
set
forth
with
great
clarity
is
that
both
governments,
and
the
japanese
government
has
consistently
taken
this
position,
agree
on
the
meaning
of
article
viii
of
the
treaty
with
respect
to
subsidiaries
incorporated
in
the
host
country,
and
this
view
comports
completely
with
the
plain
text
of
the
treaty.
it
is
only
by
going
behind
that
text
for
other
reasons
that
the
court
below
or
the
fifth
circuit
reached
a
contrary
result.
the
definition
that
appears,
and
the
text
of
the
pertinent
provisions
is
set
forth
in
petitioner's
brief.
the
definition
that
appears
in
article
xxii,
which
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
that
brief,
is
one
of
four
subsections
of
that
article,
all
of
which
are
definitional
in
nature,
and
none
of
which
would
have
any
function
in
the
treaty
unless
they
were
to
illuminate
the
usage
of
terms
in
other
provisions
of
the
treaty.
there
is
no
other
meaning
to
article
xxii
of
the
treaty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
really
think
there
is
a
difficulty.
perhaps
i
should
turn
to
that
immediately.
i
was
just
going
to
further
elucidate
about
article
viii
itself,
gives
an
example
of
the
usage
of
these
terms
in
a
way,
in
the
second
sentence
of
article
viii,
it
is
obviously
designed
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
subsidiary
incorporated
in
the
host
country
which
would
not
be
allowed
to
have
accountants
and
others
practicing
for
it
who
could
not
qualify
under
local
law,
whereas
the
parent
in
the
foreign
country
would
be
allowed
to
send
in
such
a
person.
and
right
there,
in
article
viii
itself,
the
distinction
is
drawn
for
a
very
plausible
reason,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
first
sentence
of
article
viii
means
anything
different,
and
let
me
try
to
clarify
what
has
been
said
about
our
discussion
of
treaty
trader
visas,
because
i
think
considerable
confusion
has
been
introduced
by
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
securing
of
a
treaty
trader
visa
in
any
way
illuminates
the
rights
of
the
employing
company.
all
we
meant
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
in
the
sentence
that
was
quoted,
if
one
hypothesizes
that
as
we
contend,
title
vii
applies
to
the
subsidiary
and
to
its
hiring
decisions,
nonetheless,
the
treaty,
through
article
i
and
through
article
vii,
gives
the
subsidiary
rights
with
respect
to
its
operations
here,
and
it
can
consider
japanese
nationals
in
filling
its
positions,
and
it
can
do
that
consistently
with
title
vii
either
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis
by
deciding
that
the
japanese
national
is
the
better
qualified
person
for
a
particular
position,
or
by
showing
as
a
matter
of
business
necessity
that
others
need
not
be
considered
for
that
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
independent
of
the
treaty.
it
is
a
right
under
title
vii,
but
what
is
needed
from
the
treaty
is
the
way
to
get
that
person
into
the
country
to
be
employed,
and
that
is
what
is
conferred
by
article
i
of
the
treaty
and
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
law
that
allows
these
people
to
come
in
under
treaty
trader
visas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
the
treaty
only...
through
article
vii
the
treaty
gives
them
the
very
valuable
right
of
standing
on
an
equal
footing
with
other
companies
incorporated
in
the
united
states.
they
are
entitled
to
national
treatment.
the
heart
of
the
treaty,
as
it
has
been
defined.
but
this
has
no
implications
for
whether
title
vii
applies
or
not.
all
we
are
pointing
out
in
this
first
part
of
the
discussion
is
that
they
can
bring
in
a
japanese
national,
but
in
doing
so
they
might
or
might
not
be
violating
someone
else's
rights
under
title
vii.
that
is
a
separate
question,
and
when
a
consular
official
issues
a
visa,
all
that
official
is
determining
is
whether
the
individual
applying
to
him
qualifies
for
the
visa.
he
makes
no
determination
about
the
company's
rights.
the
consular
official
sees
to
it
that
the
individual
who
has
applied
to
him
for
the
visa
has
been
offered
a
job
in
the
united
states
that
qualifies
as
one
of
the
jobs
for
which
he
is
entitled
to
the
issuance
of
a
visa.
it
may
be
that
the
company
in
offering
him
that
job
has
violated
someone
else's
title
vii
rights.
that
is
a
separate
question
that
is
not
even
addressed,
and
need
not
be
addressed
by
the
consular
official,
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
right
to
the
visa.
even
if
it
were
later
determined
that
title
vii
were
violated
by
that
appointment,
title
vii
remedies
do
not
bump
an
incumbent
employee
out
of
the
job.
so,
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
right
to
enter
the
united
states
to
take
the
job,
and
we
were
talking
about
something
quite
separate
on
page
21
when
we
talked
about
the
possibility
that
the
parent
company
may
claim
a
right
to
assign
certain
persons
to
the
subsidiary.
it
is
premature
in
this
case
to
know
whether
that
question
is
presented
at
all.
on
the
face
of
things,
all
of
these
people
are
employees
of
the
subsidiary,
and
there
has
been
no
proof
made
that
any
of
them
were
assigned
to
the
subsidiary
by
the
parent
company,
nor
do
we
know
yet
the
circumstances
under
which
that
assignment
was
made,
whether
it
really
could
be
argued
to
have
been
made
in
exercise
of
the
parent
company's
treaty
right
to
manage
and
control
the
subsidiary,
or
whether
it
might
have
been,
for
example,
just
part
of
a
training
program
for
the
parent
company's
personnel,
to
give
them
some
experience
here
and
there,
so
that
they
will
be
better
employees
in
the
parent
company
in
future
years,
which
would
raise
a
different
question
of
whether
there
is
a
right
under
the
treaty
to
assign
persons
for
that
kind
of
reason.
the
record
simply
is
not
developed
enough
to
address,
in
our
view,
any
question
other
than
the
article
viii
question
on
which
the
contracting
parties
agree
and
the
language
of
the
treaty
is
clear,
and
in
response
to
this,
all
the
petitioners
have
been
able
to
do
is
try
to
introduce
some
possible
ambiguities
or
inconsistencies
in
the
negotiating
history
or
the
subsequent
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
and
that
cannot
be
enough
to
overturn
the
meaning
of
the
plain
language
agreed
to
by
the
contracting
parties.
