unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
professor
chayes,
you
would
carry
that
down
to
a
subsidiary
of
a
subsidiary.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
subsidiary,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
owned
40
percent
by
a
foreign
parent,
or
55
percent?
unknown
speaker
how
wouldn't
it
bother
you?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
brief
filed
by
the
united
states
is
also
filed
on
behalf
of
the
state
department.
unknown
speaker
at
least
the
legal
advisor's
name
is
on
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
or
whom
it
supports.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
state
department
supports
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
say
that
now.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
differences
functionally
between
the
two
types
of
structures,
the
subsidiary
and
the
branch?
unknown
speaker
for
the
purposes
we
are
here
today,
what
do
you
think
are
the
critical
differences?
unknown
speaker
functionally,
they
are
the
same.
unknown
speaker
there
may
be...
conceivably
there
might
be
some
tax
consequences
of
being
one
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
distinguish
that
statement
from
a
functional
analysis?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question?
what
function
does
the
definition
in
article
xxii
perform
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
they
just
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
the
treaty
traders,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
don't
they
just
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
identifying--
unknown
speaker
--individuals
who
would
be
treaty
traders?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading?
unknown
speaker
twenty-one.
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
non-top
level
management?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
executive
personnel
isn't
top
level,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
you
are
going
to
tell
me
what
the
treaty
means,
then.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
once
more--
unknown
speaker
--because
i
want
to
get
these
levels
of
employees
firmly
in
mind,
if
i
may.
the
derivative
right
that
they
agree
you
may
have,
they
are
not...
they
are
somewhat...
on
page
21--
unknown
speaker
--is
top
level
management
through
another
provision
of
the
treaty
that
would
authorize
management
and
control
of
the
subsidiary,
which
is...
would
you
agree
that
is
not
coextensive
with
the
concept
of
people
of
their
choice,
attorneys,
agents,
and
other
specialists
of
their
choice?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
what
i
am
really
asking,
you
don't
construe
their
brief
as
conceding
that
those
two
concepts
are
coextensive.
unknown
speaker
the
scope
of
which
right,
the
top
management
right
or
the
executive
of
their
choice
right?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
two
different.
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to--
unknown
speaker
--the
executives
of
their
choice
language.
unknown
speaker
it
is
still
a
question
of
treaty
construction,
though.
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief,
you
note
that
the
regulation
comes
from
a
1981
codification.
was
the
regulation
as
contemporaneous
as
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
does
the
knowledge,
the
command
of
the
japanese
language
and
a
knowledge
of
japanese
customs
and
traditions
in
business
enter
into
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
government
thought
we
were
going
to
agree
with
you
up
to
this
point,
they
might
agree.
unknown
speaker
if
the
government
thought
we
were
going
to
agree
with
you
up
to
this
point,
they
might
agree--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
consular
decision
should
not
be
reviewed.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
may
ask
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
may
ask
them.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority
for
saying
that
the
consular
officer's
judgment
is
final
in
a
suit
in
a
federal
court
involving
some
treaty
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
true
so
far
as
letting
a
person
into
the
country,
but
the
question
here
isn't
whether
they
should
have
been
let
into
the
country
or
not,
but
whether
they
qualify
under
the
treaty
so
as
to
afford
a
defense
to
a
title
vii
action.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
question
of
whether
the
man's
visa
is
all
right.
we
are
not
asking
that
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chayes,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
that
troubles
me
about
the
way
in
which
the
case
comes
to
us?
as
i
understand
it,
the
1292(b)
appeal
was
just
on
the
issue
of
what
kind
of
a
company
is
the
subsidiary.
it
seems
to
me
not
only
do
we
have
a
possible
difference
between
top
executives
and
people
of
their
own
choice.
we
might
also
have
a
difference
between
that
category
and
the
jobs
that
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
everything
can
be
resolved
beyond
the
first
issue.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
it
is
quite
one
thing...
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
these
people
may
come
in
and
work
here,
give
them
permission
to
come,
and
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
that
necessarily
means
that
no
woman
in
new
york
can
be
eligible
for
any
of
these
jobs,
which
is
in
fact
what
they
are
claiming.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chayes,
one
of
the
complaining
women
below
was
a
japanese
national,
was
she
not?
unknown
speaker
so
title
vii
applies
to
her.
unknown
speaker
mr.
steel,
what
would
you
suggest
are
the
differences
functionally
between
a
branch
and
a
subsidiary?
unknown
speaker
how
would
they
relate
to
the
article
iii
aspect
of
the
treaty?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
affect
their
function,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
reason
why
the
japanese
parent
creates...
establishes
the
branch
or
the--
unknown
speaker
--subsidiary,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
united
states
or
the
state
department
had
a
different
view
than
it
now
expresses
in
years
gone
by,
even
in
the
face
of
this
plain
language?
unknown
speaker
as
to
this
plain
language.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
described
both
of
the
letters
as
cursory,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
unless
the
administrator
has
put
some
of
the
reasoning
into
his
communication,
we
haven't
customarily
gone
into
that
degree
of
psychoanalysis,
have
we,
of
saying
that
he
must
have
had
all
this
available,
and
presumably
he
relied
on
it
even
though
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
communication?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
so
far
as
the
supporting
reasoning,
to
the
extent
that
under
cases
like
the
swift,
skidmore
analysis
of
the
weight
that
is
given
to
administrative
construction,
neither
of
these
letters
would
appear
to
have
a
great
deal
of
supporting
reasoning
contained
in
them.
unknown
speaker
do
the
states
have
any
reciprocal
problems
with
other
states
of
the
united
states
that
americans
have
with
overseas
operations?
i
am
addressing
now
the
reciprocity
aspect
that
has
been
mentioned
of
article
viii.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understood
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
to
say
that
even
if
you
treat
subsidiaries
different
from
divisions,
he
still
doesn't
lose
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you
are
going
to...
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
that.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
agree
with
the
united
states
then
that
these
companies
can
achieve
the
same
result--
unknown
speaker
--derivatively
through
the
treaty
trader.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
the
issue
we
were
just
talking
about,
the
treaty
trader,
is
that
issue
even
here?
what
issue
do
you
think
is
before
us?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking...
what
do
you
think
the
issue
is
before
us
now?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
just
by
virtue
of
the
face
of
the
treaty.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
must
we
get
to
that
latter
part?
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
lost
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
steel,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
do
any
of
your
people
still
have
employment
with
sumitomo?
unknown
speaker
many?
unknown
speaker
you
are
now
into
your
colleague's
time,
mr.
steel.
unknown
speaker
at
his
expense.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
view
of
the
japanese
government
is
consistent
with
the
view
you
have
taken.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
should
we
stop
there,
mr.
wallace,
or
should
we
go
on
and
resolve
the
question
raised
about
the
difficulty
of
interpreting
who
is
covered
by
the
treaty
trader?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
quite
independently
of
the
treaty?
unknown
speaker
but
the
right
to
defend
the
title
vii
action
in
you
view,
doesn't
it
depend
on
the
treaty,
and
the
treaty
doesn't
give
them
anything
added?
