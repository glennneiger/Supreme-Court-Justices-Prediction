justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
under
the
collective-bargaining
contract
signed
by
petitioner
kaiser
steel
and
the
united
mine
workers
of
america,
kaiser
was
required
to
pay
into
certain
union
pension
funds,
a
specified
amount
of
money
for
each
ton
of
coal
that
it
mined.
it
was
also
--
it
also
promised
in
the
contract
to
make
similar
payments
with
respect
to
each
ton
of
coal
purchased
from
other
producers
on
which
payments
have
--
had
not
been
made
into
the
funds.
this
was
a
so-called
purchased-coal
clause.
during
the
life
of
the
contract,
kaiser
paid
the
required
money
with
respect
to
coal
that
it
mined
but
it
didnâ€™t
make
the
payments
with
respect
to
a
considerable
amount
of
coal
that
it
purchased
from
other
producers.
when
sued
by
the
pension
fund
trustees,
kaiser
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
purchased-coal
clause
was
illegal
not
only
as
a
restraint
of
trade
under
the
antitrust
laws
but
as
a
hot
cargo
clause
that
was
illegal
under
section
8(e)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
even
if
the
purchased-coal
clause
was
illegal
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
the
labor
laws,
he
promise
it
was
enforceable
in
a
suit
by
the
pension
fund
trustees.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
for
the
reasons
that
we
stated
in
opinion
on
the
file
with
the
court,
we
say
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
historic
rule
that
the
courts
will
not
enforce
illegal
promises,
so
the
judgment
is
reverse.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
