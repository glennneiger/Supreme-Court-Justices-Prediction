unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
the
reporting
requirement
was
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
the
clause
or
the
enforcement
of
the
clause
that
is
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
didn't
enforce
it?
would
there
be
any
problem?
unknown
speaker
mr.
melamed,
what
do
you
think
the
effect
of
the
1980
amendments
was?
unknown
speaker
does
the
legislative
history
of
those
amendments
indicate
that
congress
was
trying
to
put
into
place,
if
you
will,
the
benedict
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
melamed,
i
am
looking
at
page
38a
of
the
appendices
to
the
petition
of
kaiser,
in
which
the
dissenting
opinion
quotes
from
the
majority
opinion,
saying
that,
"the
narrow
issue
on
appeal
therefore
is
not
whether
an
illegal
contract
clause
should
be
enforced,
but
rather
whether
kaiser's
proffered
defense
of
illegality
should
be
entertained.
"
what
does
that
mean
to
you?
does
that
mean
that
a
defendant
can
set
up
a
defense
and
a
court
can
simply
say,
we
don't
know
or
care
whether
it
is
a
good
defense
or
a
bad
defense,
we
simply
won't
hear
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
melamed,
did
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
did
that
suggest
that
the
1980
amendments
are
inapplicable
to
any
decision
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
even
assuming
their
applicability?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
they
are
inapplicable?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
incidentally,
the
plaintiffs
here
are
really
third
party
beneficiaries,
trustees,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
parties
to
the
so
called
illegal
agreement.
unknown
speaker
they
are
third
parties
unofficially.
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
the
1980
amendments,
or
do
they,
if
if
applicable,
they
do
have
a
bearing
on
what
defenses
are
available
when
the
suits
by
the
third
party
beneficiary,
stakeholder,
whatever
you
want
to
call
the
trustees,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
you
think
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that,
i
gather,
rests
on
the
language
"not
inconsistent
with
law"?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
1980
amendments?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
they
considered
cases
precisely
like
this?
unknown
speaker
the
1980
amendments
were
adopted
within
weeks,
were
they
not,
after
the
decision
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
there
was
no
reference
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1980
amendments
to
the
pendency
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did,
i
gather,
give
a
lot
of
attention
at
least
to
lewis
and
benedict
coal
in
the
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
did
they
address
kelly
and
kosuga,
too?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
benedict
case,
doesn't
it
really
rest
on
the
theory
that
the
court
should
separate
an
employer's
obligation
to
contribute
to
a
pension
fund
from
any
grievances
the
employer
has
against
the
union?
isn't
that
the
fundamental
thrust
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
grant
you
it
didn't
involve
illegality,
but
as
i
read
the
majority
opinion,
it
might
appear
that
the
reasoning
could
include
this
case.
i
just
wondered
how
you
would
deal
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
freeing
kaiser
of
the
obligation
to
make
these
payments
mean
that
the
pension
fund
would
have
to,
in
order
to
be
solvent,
or
to
do
what
it
was
supposed
to
do,
have
to
collect
higher--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
think
at
least
we
should
judge
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
this
required
payment
was
not
deemed
to
be
part
of
the
actuarial
soundness
of
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
or
to
contribute
to
the
actuarial--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
guess
this
turns
on
what
you
just
said,
mr.
melamed,
that
kaiser
could
simply
have
discontinued
buying
any
coal
from
continental
or
anyone
else
under
that
purchase
of
coal
clause.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
the
trustees
would
have
gotten
no
payments.
that
doesn't
follow.
if
it
didn't
buy
the
coal
there,
they
would
have
had
to
produce
it
themselves,
wouldn't
they?
of
course,
it
is
a
different
kind
of
coal,
i
realize.
unknown
speaker
they
weren't
going
to
curtail
their
operations,
i
don't
suppose.
unknown
speaker
and
then
more
money
would
have
gone
into
the
fund.
of
course,
more
men
would
have
worked,
and
there
would
have
been
more
of
an
obligation.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
purchased
coal
from
a
union
producer?
unknown
speaker
that
producer
would
have
had
the
obligation,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
anything
in
this
contract
to
prevent
them
from
importing
it
if
they
could
find
an
exporter
who
had
some
coal
to
send
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing...
there
is
no
limit
on
their
importing?
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
melamed,
how
do
you
distinguish
kelly
and
kosuga?
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
suggest,
the
difference
is?
unknown
speaker
what
defenses
are
permitted
under
the
1980
amendments?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
defense?
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
not
a
valid
302(c)(5)
trust?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
is
that
the
only
defense
then
available?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
where
the
payment,
for
example,
were
a
bribe.
unknown
speaker
and
that
means
only
something
like
a
bribe,
where
the
payment
itself
is
illegal?
unknown
speaker
and
the
payment
here,
you
say,
to
the
trustees
is
not
in
and
of
itself
illegal.
the
only
illegality
relied
on
is
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--there
is
nothing
illegal
about
the
trustees
receiving
and
applying
the
receipts
to
the
pension
fund.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
in
the
1980
statute--
unknown
speaker
--congress
might
have
used
more
explicit
language
than
the
one
you
rely
on,
not
inconsistent
with
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
it.
you
have
to
give
it
a
gloss,
provided
by
the
legislative
history,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
might
have
said,
"shall,
as
long
as
the
payment
itself
is
not
illegal.
"
or
something
like
that,
instead
of
"not
inconsistent
with
law".
unknown
speaker
what
of
mr.
melamed's
argument
that
in
any
event
the
1980
statute
was
not
adopted
until
weeks
after
the
decision
in
this
case
below,
and
therefore
it
is
inapplicable?
unknown
speaker
it
was
only
nine
days?
unknown
speaker
it
is
obligated
to--
--mr.
pollak--
--go
ahead.
can't
we
really
examine,
though,
whether
the
1980
amendments
impose
new
and
anticipated
obligations
on
kaiser,
and
therefore
we
wouldn't
apply
those
amendments?
that
is
a
concern,
and
i
would
like
you
to
address
yourself
to
that.
unknown
speaker
is
that
something
of
a
reflection
of
the
doctrine
of
in
pari
delicto?
unknown
speaker
two
contracting
parties,
you
say,
agreed
to
what
is
now
asserted
to
be
an
illegal
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
suggest
that
doesn't
reach
a
third
party
beneficiary
the
same
way
it
would
one
of
the
original
parties
in
equal--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
pollak?
unknown
speaker
i
realize
that
there
is
a
nine
day
difference
between
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
the
act.
which
came
first?
unknown
speaker
so
then
your
northcross
argument
basically
is
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
when
it
decided
the
case,
we
should
affirm
it
because
the
law
has
been
changed
since
then?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
wasn't
in
effect
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollak,
just
so
i
can
understand
your
position
about
the
1980
act,
suppose
now
that
kaiser
went
to
the
labor
board
and
after
proceedings
there
this
clause
was
declared
to
be
an
illegal
hot
cargo
clause.
unknown
speaker
would
then
kaiser
have
to
nevertheless
honor
it
from
then
on?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
it
yes
or
no,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
to
honor
this
promise
that
it
made
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
board
has
declared
it
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
a
hot
cargo
clause?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that...
well,
how
about
the
future?
unknown
speaker
how
about
from
the
date
of
the
labor
board's
decision,
from
then
on?
unknown
speaker
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
would
they
have
to
make
the
payments
to
the...
continue
to
make
the
payments
to
the
pension
fund?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
that
what
congress
really
did
is
to
amend
the
labor
law
and
the
antitrust
law
in
the
1980
act
by
saying
that...
of
course,
we
know
that
hot
cargo
clauses
are
illegal,
but
if
an
employer
has
put
one
in
the
contract
and
agreed
to
it,
he
nevertheless
has
to
honor
it?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
been
thrashed
out
before
the
labor
board,
between
the
union
and
the
employer--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
labor
board
has
decided
the
contract
is
illegal.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
board
really
then
should
dismiss
the
case
is
the
first
place,
because
it
would
be
just
a
waste
of
time
to
adjudicate
it.
unknown
speaker
but
it
could
not
order
the
parties
to
quit
honoring
that
promise.
unknown
speaker
you
say,
because
congress
has
now
told
it
not
to.
unknown
speaker
but
the
existing
contract
he
must
abide
by
until
it
expires?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand,
mr.
pollak,
that
the
current
contract
does
not
have
this
purchase
clause
in
it?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
hiatus
between
1978
and
1981?
unknown
speaker
so
they
have
all
had
this
purchase
of
coal
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
is
worried
about
the
soundness
or
the
liquidity
of
the
pension
plan.
unknown
speaker
and
wanted
to
have
remedies
against
liquid
employers,
but
what
if
this
employer
obeyed
the
contract
by
just
quitting
purchasing
outside
coal?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
affect...
there
wouldn't
be
any
money
going
into
the
pension
fund.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
clear,
mr.
pollak,
that
the
benefits
for
the
people
who
are
going
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
fund
in
due
course
are
not...
the
potential
liability
for
benefits
is
not
increased
in
the
slightest
by
the
purchase
of
outside
coal,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
liability
to
the
people
who
are
going
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
fund
eventually,
the
workmen.
unknown
speaker
their
benefits
are
measured
by
their
period
of
service,
and--
unknown
speaker
--the
company
has
paid
into
the
fund
for
all
of
their
service,
so
that
if
they
buy
outside,
that
doesn't
increase
the
liabilities
to
them.
if
they
pay
on
that
coal,
it
increases
the
assets
of
the
fund,
but
without
any
corresponding
increase
in
liabilities.
unknown
speaker
but
basically
the
funding
is
computed,
is
it
not,
on
the
basis
of
how
many
hours
worked
on
the
tonnage
on
which
royalties
have
been
paid.
that
is
the
basic
measure
of
the
actuarial
soundness
of
the
plan,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
purchase
of
outside
coal
does
not
increase
the
liabilities
of
the
fund
in
this--
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
language
"unless
otherwise
contrary
to
law"?
unknown
speaker
but
we
are
faced
with
an
enacted
statutory
clause
here,
which
i
would
assume
would
take
precedence
over
committee
prints
or
floor
debate.
unknown
speaker
would
you
also
take
the
position
that
mr.
pollak
did
that
even
if
the
nlrb
had
determined
during
the
course
of
a
contract
that
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
is
illegal,
that
nevertheless
the
trustees
would
be
entitled
to
collect
those
payments
under
that
illegal
provision?
unknown
speaker
including,
you
mean,
a
remedy
that
kaiser
should
not
have
to
pay
trustees?
unknown
speaker
could
the
board's
remedy
go
that
far?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
follow
that.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
they
could
not,
as
part
of
the
remedy,
find
it
a
hot
cargo
clause
and
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
they
could
order
kaiser
not
to
make
any
further
payments
under
the
clause.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
despite
what
you
say
congress
said
in
the
1980
at.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
the
board
could
make
an
error.
is
that
what
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
should
set
that
kind
of
an
order
aside?
unknown
speaker
just
because
you
think
that
congress
really
in
a
way
amended
the
labor
laws.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
board
in
reality
couldn't
order
kaiser
not
to
make
any
further
payments
into
the
fund,
because
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
set
it
aside?
unknown
speaker
ms.
etkind,
let
me
interrupt
you
a
minute.
supposing
you
had
an
agreement,
a
term
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
just
manifestly
unlawful,
that
required
the
employer,
say,
to
charge
prices
above
a
ceiling
price,
or
to
agree
to
a
price
with
its
competitors
or
something,
and
then
provided
that
50
percent
of
the
overcharge
as
a
result
of
such
illegal
agreement
shall
be
deposited
in
the
fund.
would
you
say
that...
they
would
still
have
to
deposit
the...
enforce
such
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
how
obvious
the
illegality?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
legislative
history
supports
that
reading?
unknown
speaker
even
if
they
were
getting
it
by
robbing
banks,
holding
up
people
and
all,
they
still
put
the
money
in
the
fund?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
a
more
gentile,
civilized
hypothetical.
suppose
that
seven
manufacturers
of
certain
products
all
agreed
that
they
would
fix
prices,
clearly
unlawful,
but
they
agreed
that
if
anyone
broke
ranks,
the
one
who
broke
ranks
would
have
to
pay
a
certain
contribution
to
the
pension
funds
of
all
the
others
who
remained
loyal
to
the
price
fixing
agreement.
enforceable?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
giving
you
a
different
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
on
a
clearly
illegal
contract
that
calls
for
a
certain
payment
for
those
who
break
the
price
fixing
agreement.
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
covers
plans
as
well
as
collective
bargaining
agreements.
it
is
not
limited
to
collective
bargaining
agreements.
unknown
speaker
and
the
chief
justice
described
a
plan
to
you.
unknown
speaker
just
exactly
as
i
put
it.
seven
companies
all
make
the
same
product.
they
have
a
nice
private
agreement
they
are
going
to
fix
prices,
and
in
the
agreement,
written
out,
they
say
anybody
who
breaks
ranks
is
going
to
have
to
pay
on
some
measured
proportion
that
amount
to
the
pension
funds
of
the
other
people
who
are
loyal
to
the
price
fixing
agreement.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
to
challenge
it.
you
would
still
have
to
pay
it
by
the
terms
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
because
the
statute
wasn't
enacted
until
nine
days
after
the
decision
below,
the
statute
is
inapplicable
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
this
to
say
you
also
rely
on
bradley?
unknown
speaker
is
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
dependent
solely
on
the
applicability
of
306?
unknown
speaker
you
rely
solely
on
306?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
the
argument
was
that
congress
intended
to
amend
the
labor
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws.
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
relying
on
the
legislative
history
to
support
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
an
implied
repeal.
