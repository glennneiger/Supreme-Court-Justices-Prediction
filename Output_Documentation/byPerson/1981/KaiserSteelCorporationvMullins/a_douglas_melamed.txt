mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
one
basic
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
a
federal
court
will
enforce
a
contract
provision
that
violates
the
federal
antitrust
and
labor
laws
and
has
been
declared
by
congress
to
be
unenforceable
and
void.
until
this
case,
no
court
had
ever
enforced
a
contract
provision
that
was
alleged
to
be
illegal
without
resolving
the
illegality
defense
on
the
merits.
the
courts
below
nevertheless
made
that
unprecedented
decision.
the
basic
facts
that
should
be
presumed
are
as
follows.
since
1971,
the
united
mine
workers
union
has
insisted
on
including
in
all
of
its
contracts
a
provision
that
would
require
employers
to
make
payments
payable
to
the
umw
health
and
welfare
fund
for
every
ton
of
coal
they
purchase
from
a
non
u
w
producer.
this
provision,
called
the
purchase
of
coal
clause,
is
intended
to
induce
umw
signatories
not
to
purchase
coal
from
and
thus
to
boycott
non
u
m
w
producers,
and
to
penalize
companies
like
kaiser
steel
that
choose
to
do
business
with
those
producers.
the
payments
called
for
by
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
bear
no
relationship
to
the
amount
of
labor
services
provided
to
a
umw
signatory
by
its
union
employees.
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
was
widely
understood
in
the
industry
to
be
of
doubtful
legality,
and
many
umw
signatories,
including
kaiser
steel,
ignored
the
clause.
kaiser
steel
complied
with
all
of
the
lawful
provisions
in
its
collective
bargaining
agreements,
including
those
provisions
that
required
it
regularly
to
make
contributions
to
the
umw
health
and
welfare
funds
for
each
ton
of
coal
produced
by
kaiser
steel
and
each
hour
worked
by
its
umw
employees.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
yes.
the
reporting
requirement
was
simply
an
effort
to
facilitate
the
unlawful
purchase
of
coal
clause
and
to
monitor
purchases
by
umw
signatories
of
non
signatories
and
was
therefore
simply
an
unlawful
adjunct
to
the
purchase
of
coal
clause.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
the
clause
itself
is
unlawful.
it
is
unlawful
both
under
the--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--well,
i
think
it
would
be...
the
entering
into
the
agreement
and
the
making
an
agreement
is
technically
a
violation
of
law.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
have
any
injury
or
any
damage
action
as
a
result
of
merely
executing
the
contract
instrument.
kaiser
steel,
as
i
said,
refused
to
comply
only
with
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
which
it
believed
to
be
illegal.
the
health
and
welfare
fund
trustees,
the
respondents
here,
for
years
made
no
effort
to
enforce
the
purchase
of
coal
clause,
but
in
1978,
shortly
after
the
1974
agreement
had
expired,
respondents
commenced
a
series
of
lawsuits
seeking
to
enforce
the
purchase
of
coal
clause.
in
this
case,
respondents
alleged
a
single
cause
of
action,
kaiser
steel's
failure
to
comply
with
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
in
the
then
expired
1974
agreement.
in
defense,
kaiser
steel
alleged
that
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
respondent
sought
to
enforce
violates
both
section
80
of
the
labor-management
relations
act
and
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act,
and
is
therefore
unenforceable
and
void.
respondents
moved
for
summary
judgment,
arguing
that
they
are
entitled
to
enforce
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
even
if
it
is
illegal.
the
district
court
granted
their
motion.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
and
by
a
vote
of
seven
to
four
denied
kaiser
steel's
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc.
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
rejecting
kaiser
steel's
illegality
defense
are
unprecedented.
until
this
case,
no
court
had
ever
enforced
a
contract
clause
alleged
to
be
illegal
without
resolving
the
illegality
defense
on
the
merits,
and
satisfying
itself
that
the
contract
was
lawful.
indeed,
in
case
after
case,
this
court
and
lower
courts
have
held
that
federal
courts
do
not
enforce
illegal
contract
clauses,
and
they
have
so
held
without
regard
to
the
identity
of
the
defendant
or
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff,
even
where,
as
here,
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
accrued
monetary
obligations
and
the
defendant
has
received
the
consideration
due
him
under
the
contract.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
don't
think
the
1981
amendments,
your
honor,
have
anything
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
1981
amendments,
to
be
sure,
provide
new
procedural
vehicles
and
new
federal
causes
of
action
for
pension
fund
trustees
seeking
to
enforce
obligations
and
contracts
for
employers
to
make
contributions
to
pension
funds,
but
they
impose
those
obligations
on
employers
only
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
to
the
extent
not
inconsistent
with
law.
the
statute
nowhere
says
when
the
making
of
payments
or
contracts
calling
for
them
would
be
consistent
or
inconsistent
with
law.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
well,
there
is
no
question
that
some
congressmen
spoke
and
praised
the
lewis
v.
benedict
coal
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
addresses
our
issue.
the
congressmen
were,
to
be
sure,
concerned
that
dilatory
tactic
by
employers
had
obstructed
collection
actions,
but
every
time
they
spoke
of
their
concerns,
they
spoke
of
defenses
raised
by
employers
that
were
unrelated
or
extraneous
to,
in
their
words,
the
employer's
promise
and
the
plan's
entitlement
to
the
contributions.
now,
as
i
hope
our
briefs
made
clear,
it
is
the
law
and
it
ought
to
be
the
law
that
an
employer
cannot
defend
an
effort
to
enforce
a
lawful
contract
provision
on
the
ground
that
other
contract
provisions
or
other
agreements
or
conduct
outside
the
contract
may
be
unlawful.
that
is
what
lewis
v.
benedict
coal,
huge
v.
long's
hauling,
kelly
v.
kosuga,
and
the
other
cases
on
which
respondents
rely
are
all
about.
they
are
all
about
extraneous,
unrelated
defenses.
that
is
not
what
this
case
is
about.
in
this
case,
kaiser
steel's
defense
is
that
the
very
promise
respondents
seek
to
enforce
is
itself
illegal,
and
that
the
plans
are
therefore
not
entitled
to
the
money
called
for
by
the
purchase
of
coal
clause,
and
that
the
plans
are
therefore
not
entitled
to
the
money
called
for
by
the
purchase
of
coal
clause.
therefore,
even
if
we
could
look
beyond
the
statute
which
plainly
on
its
terms,
i
think,
leaves
unresolved
and
for
determination
in
accordance
with
the
prior
law,
the
question
when
contribution
payments
are
lawful
and
unlawful,
or
consistent
with
law
and
inconsistent
with
law.
even
if
we
look
beyond
the
statute,
and
assume
that
it
was
intended
to
embody
the
remarks
of
these
two
or
three
congressmen,
it
wouldn't
address
the
issue
here,
because
nothing
that
those
congressmen
said
or
the
cases
to
which
they
referred
said
that
an
employer
should
be
obligated
to
comply
with
an
illegal
contract
clause
or
the
court
should
enforce
such
contract
clauses.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
think
that
is
what
the
majority
held
in
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
rehnquist.
it
held
that
we
don't
care,
we
are
not
going
to
examine
the
question,
we
are
not
going
to
consider
the
impact
of
this
contract
provision
and
its
lawfulness.
i
don't
understand,
frankly,
why
it
is
that
the
majority
thought
there
might
be
a
difference
between
that
case
and
a
case
where
he
couldn't
look
the
other
way,
as
it
were,
and
had
to
acknowledge
the
unlawfulness
of
the
contract.
certainly
the
decided
cases
don't
make
that
distinction,
because
in
most
of
them
where
the
illegality
defense
has
been
raised
and
the
courts
have
refused
to
enforce
allegedly
illegal
contracts,
there
had
been
no
prior
determination
of
unlawfulness
and
the
courts
having
the
allegation
examined
the
lawfulness
of
the
contract
and
then
made
the
decision
whether
to
enforce
it
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
say,
didn't
even
do
that.
it
didn't
even
examine
the
contract
clause.
it
simply
refused
to
look
at
it
at
all.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
believe
that
the
erisa
amendments
are
inapplicable.
the
particular
response
i
made
to
justice
o'connor
was
whether
they
resolved
the
question
of
the
availability
of
the
illegality
defense.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
that's
right.
there
is
the
separate
question
of
whether
they
would
provide
jurisdiction
and
the
various
sanctions.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
think
they
are
inapplicable,
justice
brennan,
because
i
don't
know
of
a
case
in
which
a
statute
that
purported
to
create
new
statutory
duties
was
imposed
where
the
effect
of
that
was
to
impose
sanctions
for
the
breach
of
those
duties
on
someone
whose
alleged
breach
took
place
three
years
before
the
statute
became
effective.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
well,
they
are
not
the
ones
that--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--that's
correct.
judge--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--i
think
not,
justice
brennan.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
think
even
if
applicable
they
provide
a
cause
of
action,
they
would
provide
remedies
and
sanctions
available
to
any
plaintiff,
including
third
party
beneficiaries,
but
for
the
reasons
i
stated
to
justice
o'connor
i
don't
believe
they
changed
the
availability
of
the
illegality
defense.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
that's
the
statutory
language
that
i
think
preserves
legal
obstacles
to
enforcing
illegal
contracts,
and
as
i
indicated,
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
is
not
to
the
contrary.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
as
i
have
indicated,
justice
white,
i
think
the
legislative
histories
spoke
in
general
terms
of
the
need
for
federal
remedy,
an
erisa
remedy
and
erisa
sanctions
to
expedite
collection
actions.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
they
didn't
refer
to
any
cases
involving
the
illegality
defense.
significantly,
none
of
the
congressmen
in
their
various
statements
referred
to
this
case.
the
district
court
opinion
had
already
been
decided.
they
did
not
say,
we
praise
the
district
court
opinion
in
kaiser
steel
versus
mullins.
i
don't
know
whether
they
thought
of
it
or
whether
it
had
been
brought
to
their
attention,
but
they
did
not
address
a
single
case
involving
the
allegation
that
the
contract
provision
calling
for
contributions
to
the
pension
funds
was
itself
illegal,
void,
unenforceable.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
yes,
i
believe
about
two
weeks
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
last
fall.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
none
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
well,
they
gave
it
attention
insofar
as
they
said,
we
praise
lewis
v.
benedict
coal.
they
did
not
analyze
the
case.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
now,
apart
from
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
these
new
amendments
to
erisa
would
bear
upon
this
case,
the
basic
rationale
for
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
is
embodied
in
that
decision
and
that
respondents
devote
the
bulk
of
their
attention
to
is
a
rationale
that
turns
largely
on
the
court's
view
of
the
equities
between
the
litigants.
the
theories
that
respondents
were
third
party
beneficiaries
seeking
to
enforce
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
collecting
contributions
owed
to
health
and
welfare
funds.
they
should
be
permitted
to
collect
those
contributions,
the
theory
goes,
because
the
rest
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement
have
been
performed
and
kaiser
steel
has
received
the
services
of
its
union
employees.
this
theory
is
fatally
flawed,
in
our
view,
both
as
a
matter
of
equity
between
the
litigants
and
as
a
matter
of
law.
first,
as
to
the
equities,
the
critical
facts
stressed
repeatedly
in
respondent's
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
that
this
lawsuit
was
brought
for
accrued
obligations
after
the
contract
had
expired
and
kaiser
steel
had
foregone
its
various
statutory
remedies.
respondents
would
not
have
been
able
to
avoid
having
the
lawfulness
of
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
decided
if
appropriate
litigation
had
been
commenced
at
the
outset
of
the
contract
period.
if
kaiser
steel
or
a
non
u
m
w
producer
had
brought
a
lawsuit
seeking
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief,
or
had
gone
to
the
nlrb
in
1974,
as
the
court
of
appeals
evidently
believed
it
should
have,
or
if
respondents
had
brought
an
action
seeking
specific
performance
of
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
and
kaiser
steel
had
raised
the
illegality
defense,
or
had
counterclaimed
at
that
time,
then
respondents'
ability
to
enforce
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
would
have
depended
upon
its
lawfulness.
if,
as
should
be
assumed
here,
it
is
illegal,
they
would
not
then
have
been
able
to
enforce
the
clause.
now,
this
has
two
significant
implications.
for
one
thing,
it
makes
clear
that
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
enforce
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
simply
on
the
ground
that
this
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
or
kaiser
steel
is
an
employer,
or
respondents
were
third
party
beneficiaries
and
pension
fund
trustees.
those
facts
are
not
enough,
even
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents'
theory,
to
entitle
respondents
to
enforce
this
illegal
contract
clause.
the
earlier
remedies
and
their
consequences
also
make
clear
that
respondents'
claim
is
in
effect
that
they
should
be
better
off
because
this
lawsuit
was
commenced
in
1978
than
they
would
have
teen
had
there
been
litigation
commenced
by
them
or
by
anyone
else
in
1974.
now,
a
rule
that
respondents
could
enforce
the
clause
if
litigation
were
brought
in
1978,
but
not
if
it
were
brought
in
1974,
would
be
inequitable.
it
is
respondents,
not
kaiser
steel,
who
should
bear
responsibility
for
any
delay
in
litigation.
respondents
chose
not
to
bring
suit
to
enforce
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
earlier
because
it
was
their
policy
not
to
enforce
the
clause.
as
long
as
respondents
continued
to
adhere
to
that
policy,
there
was
no
reason
for
kaiser
steel
to
run
into
court
and
bring
needless,
speculative
litigation
challenging
the
lawfulness
of
the
purchase
of
coal
clause,
and
only
respondents,
of
course,
knew
whether
they
were
going
to
abandon
their
policy.
so,
if
anyone
should
bear
the
burden
of
delay
in
the
commencement
of
this
litigation,
it
is
respondents,
and
surely
they
should
not
be
entitled
to
turn
that
delay
into
an
excuse
for
having
new
legal
rules
that
would
make
them
better
off
than
they
would
have
been
had
there
been
litigation
about
the
lawfulness
of
this
clause
at
the
outset
of
the
contract
periods.
moreover,
a
rule
that
challenges
to
the
illegality
of
contract
provisions
are
waived
if
not
raised
promptly
would
trigger
premature
and
often
unnecessary
lawsuits
by
a
party
seeking
anticipatory
relief
from
illegal
contracts.
it
would
cause
parties
fearful
of
losing
their
rights
to
rush
to
federal
court
to
bring
actions,
to
rush
to
the
nlrb,
and
to
commence
litigation
where
forbearance
might,
as
had
been
the
pattern
in
this
industry,
have
avoided
litigation
altogether.
in
any
event,
regardless
of
these
considerations,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents
recognize
that
a
court
cannot
be
asked
to
enforce
illegal
conduct.
but,
they
argue,
kaiser
steel
had
refused
to
participate
in
the
illegal
boycott
and
now
all
that
is
at
stake
is
the
transfer
of
money
from
kaiser
steel
to
the
respondents.
the
gist
of
their
argument
is
this.
a
court
should
not
enforce
the
illegal
purchase
of
coal
clause
where
the
effect
might
be
to
induce
a
boycott
of
non
u
w
producers
and
thereby
injure
those
producers,
but
kaiser
steel
may
nevertheless
be
held
responsible
to
pay
penalties
and
damages
for
its
failure
to
participate
in
precisely
that
unlawful
boycott.
there
are
two
basic
flaws
in
this
theory.
first,
it
rests
on
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
both
section
80
of
the
labor-management
relations
act
and
the
antitrust
laws.
those
statutes
are
not
intended,
as
this
theory
would
have
it,
solely
to
protect
non
u
m
w
producers
from
illegal
boycotts.
in
the
national
woodwork
case,
this
court
held
that
the
primary
purpose
of
section
80
is
to
protect
employers
like
kaiser
steel
from
being
harmed
by
hot
cargo
clauses
like
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
or
by
damage
actions
brought
to
enforce
them.
that
is
precisely
what
this
case
is
all
about.
the
antitrust
laws,
too,
are
intended
to
protect
the
freedom
of
companies
like
kaiser
steel
to
do
business
with
whomever
they
wish
without
being
penalized
for
doing
so.
therefore,
if
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
violates
section
80,
or
the
antitrust
laws,
then
kaiser
steel
as
well
as
non
u
m
w
producers
is
entitled
to
invoke
the
protections
of
those
laws,
and
as
justice
stewart
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
connell
case,
and
as
senator
goldwater
said
in
his
remarks
about
section
80,
kaiser
steel
is
entitled
simply
to
ignore
and
to
refuse
to
comply
with
the
illegal
hot
cargo
clause.
second,
respondents'
theory
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
case
law.
in
case
after
case,
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
briefs,
the
courts
have
held
that
a
defendant
may
raise
the
illegality
defense
in
an
action
brought
to
enforce
an
illegal
contract
clause,
even
where
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
only
to
recover
accrued
obligations,
and
regardless
whether
the
payment
of
money
would
itself
or
in
and
of
itself
be
illegal
conduct.
no
case
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
on
the
facts
presented
in
lewis
v.
benedict
coal,
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
case,
your
honor,
but
that
case
was
not
presented
with
the
question
here,
which
is
whether
the
employer's
grievance
is
not
simply
with
the
union
for
some
kind
of
a
tort
or
ancillary
contract
violation,
but
rather
whether
the
employer's
complaint
is
that
it
is
being
asked
to
comply
with
a
contract
clause
that
is
illegal,
and--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--i
don't
think
it
does.
perhaps
one
way
to
look
at
that
is
to
bear
in
mind.
respondents'
concession
that
had
there
been
litigation
at
the
outset
of
the
contract
period
in
this
case,
respondents
could
have
enjoined
as
defendants
in
an
action
seeking
declaratory
relief
or
injunctive
relief.
that
is
a
sound
concession,
but
it
concedes
really
that
what
is
at
issue
here
is
whether...
is
a
threshold
question
whether
respondents
are
entitled
to
any
money,
whether
courts
should
lend
their
aid
to
contract
clauses
of
this
nature.
now,
let's
go
back
to
lewis
v.
benedict
coal.
if
the
employer
there
had
anticipated
the
strike
that
he
was
upset
about,
gone
into
court
to
seek
some
kind
of
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
against
the
union,
complaining
of
its
strike,
no
one
would
suggest
that
he
could
have
joined
the
pension
fund
trustees
as
defendants.
the
issue
there
truly
was
collateral.
the
issue
there
was
whether
because
the
employer
felt
he
was
owed
some
money
by
the
union,
he
could
use
that
as
a
set
off
against
money
he
clearly
owned
under
a
valid
and
lawful
provision
against
the
pension
fund
trustees.
that
is
a
very
different
case,
your
honor,
because
it
doesn't
raise
the
threshold
question,
which
is,
is
there
a
valid
instrument
here.
are
they
entitled
to
the
money?
and
should
a
court
lend
its
aid
to
a
contract
provision
that
congress
has
declared
to
be
unenforceable
and
void?
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
reflect
the
important
policies
that
underlie
the
rule
that
courts
do
not
enforce
illegal
contract
clauses,
all
of
which
apply
here.
the
rule
against
enforcing
illegal
agreements
preserves
the
role
of
federal
courts
as
enforcers
of
the
law.
whenever
a
court
enforces
an
unlawful
contract
provision,
it
undermines
that
role.
penalizing
kaiser
steel
for
its
purchases
of
coal
from
a
non
u
m
w
producer
would
cause
an
injury
that
both
the
labor
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws
are
intended
to
prevent,
and
enforcing
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
in
this
case
would
encourage
other
parties
to
include
illegal
contract
provisions
in
future
agreements
and
to
carry
out
their
illegal
terms.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
think
not,
justice
white.
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
was
not
intended
to
fund
the
pension
funds.
their
financial
plans
did
not
depend
on
it.
now,
those
facts
may
be
disputed.
we
have
affidavits
in
support
of
them,
and
on
this
appeal
from
summary
judgment
we
are
entitled
to
have
them
presumed.
if
we
had
complied
with
the
clause
and
done
what
the
union
wanted,
we
would
have
boycotted
midcontinent
coal
company,
we
wouldn't
have
incurred
any
obligations
under
the
purchase
of
coal
clause,
add
the
respondents
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
payments
at
all.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--i
think
that
fact
is
one
that
you
should
presume,
although
i
don't
think
it
is
essential
to
our
position.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
that's
right.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
it
is
certainly
possible
that
they--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--it
is
possible
that
had
they
not
purchased
coal
from
a
non
u
m
w
producer,
they
would
have
purchased
it
from--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--absolutely.
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
then
they
would
not
have
had
an
obligation
to
make
payments
pursuant
to
the
purchase
of
coal
clause.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
that's
correct,
and
he
would
have,
of
course,
had
more
employees
working
longer
hours.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
think
they
would
still
have
to
pay
the
royalties.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
yes.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
i
would
like
to
say--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--not
to
my
knowledge,
no.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
kelly
and
kosuga,
i
think,
really
helps
us.
kelly
had
two
contracts,
the
lawful
sale
agreement
sought
to
be
enforced,
the
illegal
non
delivery
agreement.
the
defendant
said,
the
illegal
non
delivery
agreement
gives
me
a
defense
against
the
lawful
purchase
agreement.
the
court
said,
to
be
sure,
you
wouldn't
have
to
comply
with
the
illegal
non
delivery
agreement
because
it
is
illegal
and
unenforceable,
but
you
can't
use
that
collateral
wrongdoing
as
a
defense
for
your
obligation
under
the
perfectly
lawful
sale
agreement.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
the
difference
here
is
that
we
are...
it
is
as
if
the
respondents
are
seeking
to
enforce
the
illegal
non
delivery
agreement
in
kelly.
they
have
come
into
court.
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
is
itself
illegal,
and
we
say
that
particular
clause
we
shouldn't
have
to
comply
with.
we
complied
with
all
your
other
clauses,
your
legal
clauses,
but
not
that
illegal
one.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
the
1980
amendments,
mr.
justice
brennan,
look
to
the
concern
which
congress
had
that
the
health
of
these
multi
employer
plans
on
which
millions
of
people
depend,
and
it
said
that
its
object
was
the
protection
of
beneficiaries.
it
recognized
that
that
purpose
of
the
statute
would
not
be
served
where
there
was
not
a
valid
302(c)(5)
trust,
and
where
the
payment
was
not
being
made
to
a
valid
trust,
therefore--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
colloquy
between
the
court
and
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
at
the
close
of
the
argument
really
draws
into
very
sharp
focus
the
difficulties
that
the
solicitor
general
and
respondents
have
in
defending
their
construction
of
the
new
amendments
to
the
erisa
statute.
in
that
colloquy,
it
was
pointed
out
that
even
in
so
clear
a
case
as
a
price
fitting
conspiracy
among
employers,
where
they
promised
to
enforce
deviations
from
that
conspiracy
by
paying
damages
to
a
pension
fund
on
the
solicitor
general's
construction
of
the
new
amendments,
the
courts
would
be
powerless
to
refuse
to
enforce
the
promise,
would
have
to
award
damages,
and
thus
lend
their
aid
to
the
unlawful
conspiracy.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
that
is
precisely
the
point,
justice
white.
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
that
is
correct,
but
the
point
is
that
the
breadth
of
the--
mr.
a.
douglas
melamed
--it
is
an
implied
repeal
not
only
of
the
labor
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws,
but
of
countless
other
statutes
that
one
could
imagine
one
might
wish
to
enforce
by
penal
or
damage
provisions
payable
to
third
party
beneficiaries
or
pension
fund
trustees.
it
would
open
a
gaping
loophole
in
the
enforcement
of
countless
federal
statutes.
it
would
leave
federal
courts
powerless
to
prevent
violations
of
law,
and
it
would
have
these
effects
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
statutory
language
purports
on
its
face
to
preserve
the
defense
that
the
conduct
and
the
contract
is
inconsistent
with
law
and
that
the
paltry
legislative
history
is
addressed
to
the
very
different
question,
the
question
illustrated
in
huge
v.
long's
hauling
of
an
employer's
effort
to
resist
compliance
with
a
perfectly
lawful
contract
clause
by
going
to
some
other
illegality
unrelated
to
the
clause
sought
to
be
enforced.
there
remains
one
matter
that
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
address
in
my
opening
remarks,
and
that
is
the
lower
court's
holding
that
the
district
court
did
not
even
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
the
purchase
of
coal
clause
is
an
illegal
hot
cargo
clause.
now,
this
matter
has
been
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief.
in
essence,
our
position
is
as
follows.
section
80
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
provides
without
qualification
that
all
hot
cargo
clauses
are
unenforceable
and
void.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
or
in
any
other
legal
authority
of
which
we
are
aware
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
something
different
from
that,
that
congress
meant
that
only
some
hot
cargo
clauses
are
unenforceable
and
void.
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute
or
in
the
new
statute
to
suggest
that
congress
might
have
intended,
as
the
solicitor
general
suggested,
that
the
nlrb
would
be
powerless
even
when
it
found
a
hot
cargo
clause
to
enjoin
its
continued
compliance
or
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order.
moreover,
there
is
ample
authority
for
the
proposition
that
courts
have
inherent
authority
to
decide
whether
contract
clauses
they
are
asked
to
enforce
are
lawful
and
that
federal
courts
may
decide
labor
law
issues
in
cases
where
they
arise,
in
cases
in
which
they
arise
that
are
properly
before
the
court
on
other
grounds.
it
is
simply
unthinkable
that
a
federal
court
should
be
required
to
enforce
a
contract
without
even
having
the
power
to
decide
whether
the
contract
is
lawful
and
valid
and
thus
whether
it
creates
any
enforceable
rights.
if
your
honors
have
no
questions,
i
am
prepared
to
end
my
argument.
