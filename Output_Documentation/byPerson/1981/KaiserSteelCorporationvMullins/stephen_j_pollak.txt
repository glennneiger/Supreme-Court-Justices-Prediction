mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
my
argument
to
the
principal
issue
in
this
suit
by
pension
fund
trustees
to
collect
delinquent
contributions
required
by
a
bargaining
agreement.
the
issue
is
whether
the
court
should
entertain
employer
claims
advanced
for
the
first
time
after
all
the
employee
services
have
been
provided,
that
the
clause
requiring
the
contributions
is
unlawful
under
the
sherman
act
and
as
an
80
hot
cargo
clause.
the
district
court
held
the
defenses
barred
on
summary
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
and
the
decision,
we
believe,
merits
affirmance
in
this
court
on
three
independent
grounds.
first,
the
multi-employer
pension
act
of
1980,
section
306,
applies
to
this
case
on
the
merits,
and
bars
the
defenses
kaiser
seeks
or
sought
to
raise,
and--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that
nature
of
defense--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that
is
the
defense
which
in
the
statements
of
the
floor
managers
was
referred
to.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
where
the
payment
itself
is
unlawful,
that
is
the
only
defense.
congress--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that's
correct.
congress
spoke
in
generic
terms.
the
clause
in...
age
page
2a
of
the
red
brief,
the
language
which
congress
selected
and
it
spelled
out
in
its
legislative
history
as
well,
the
interior
clause,
to
the
extent
not
inconsistent
with
law,
modifies
the
terms,
shall
make
contributions.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
illegality
here
is
a
matter
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
congress
spelled
out
that
its
concern
in
protecting
these
multi
employer
plans
was
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--no,
there
is
no
contention
that
there
is,
no,
and
congress's
concern
was
that
multi
employer
trusts,
one,
receive
timely
contributions,
and
two,
not
be
involved
in
lengthy,
complex,
and
costly
litigations
where
a
simple
collection
action--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
your
honor,
the
congress
language,
we
think,
is
clear
enough
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
in
which
the
managers--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
do
think
that
the
language
itself
in
which
congress
inserted
the
term
"shall,
to
the
extent
not
inconsistent
with
law,
make
such
contributions--
"
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that's
right.
you
will
find
that
language,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
views
of
the
committee
in
the
1979
committee
print
of
the
senate
on
s.
209,
at
page
44,
and
this
statute
had
the
meaning
which
we
contend
it
has
from
the
time
of
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
the
1979
bill
in
november,
1979,
through
the
floor
debates
in
which
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
stated
it
clearly.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
1980
statute
was
adopted
on
september
26th,
nine
days
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
we
contend--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--nine
days,
your
honor,
and
we
contend
that
on
this
court's
landmark
decision
reviewing
the
jurisprudence,
bradley
versus
richmond,
that
the
statute
clearly
is
intended
to
apply
to
pending
cases.
the
rule
is
that
a
statute
or
a
court
applies
the
law
in
effect
on
the
time
of
its
decision
unless
either
the
statutory
language
itself
or
the
legislative
history
or
a
manifest
injustice
looks
the
other
way.
now,
we
contend
here
that
looking
at
bradley,
that
this
case
fits
precisely
within
those
rubrics,
and
we
would
also
contend,
mr.
justice,
that
the
language
which
congress
adopted
statutorily
in
section
306(a)
says,
whoever
is
obligated,
so
we
suggest
that
on
this
day,
november
10,
kaiser
is
obligated
under
this
contract,
and
that
it
fits
directly
within
the
statutory
language.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
be
pleased
to
do
that,
madame
justice.
the
statute
does
not
impose
new
and
unanticipated
obligations.
indeed,
in
the
legislative
history
at
several
points
the
sponsors
as
well
as
the
committee
print
states
the
statute
clarifies
existing
law,
and
also
the
bradley
decision
would,
we
believe,
make
clear
that
the
obligation
that
is
being
discussed
here
is
the
obligation
provided
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
always
existed.
there
is
no
vested
right
in
kaiser
to
plead
an
illegality
defense,
a
pleading
by
a
party
that
claims
it
participated
as
a
signer
of
an
unlawful
contract.
that
pleading
of
the
illegality
is
only
permitted
when
it
serves
a
public
purpose,
and
the
public
purpose
clearly
is
arbitrated
by
the
united
states
congress.
the
united
states
congress
said
that
there
is
no
public
purpose
in
being
able
to
plead
an
illegality
defense
of
this
nature
to
a
claim
of
trustees
for
contributions
required
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so,
in
brief,
we
believe
there
is
no
new
or
unanticipated
obligation,
and
secondly,
there
is
no
vested
right
that
kaiser
possessed
to
plead
this
defense.
indeed,
there
is
in
the
mcnair
versus
knott
decision
of
the
supreme
court
a
very
pertinent
holding
which
said
that
a
party
to
an
unlawful
contract
has
no
right
to
plead
the
illegality,
and
congress
may
change
it
during
the
pendency
of
the
contract
or
after,
and
the
plea
may
not
be
raised.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
there
is
no
in
pari
delicto
of
the
trustees,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
one
of
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--the
language
which
is
at
the
concluding
page
or
second
to
concluding
page
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
kelly
v.
kosuga
says
that
it
is
an
unusual
sort
of
private
attorney
general
that
would
be
enforcing
an
unlawful
contract.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
three
independent
grounds,
the
1980
act
being
one
ground,
our
second
ground
being
benedict,
and
a
third
ground,
independent
of
the
other
two,
being
the
kelly
v.
kosuga
decision
of
this
court
in
1959,
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
under
garner
and
garvin
over
unfair
labor
practice
matters,
and
in
benedict
and
in
kelly
v.
kosuga,
there
were
considerations
there
that
the
pension
trustees,
not
in
kosuga,
but
in
benedict,
that
the
pension
trustees
should
not
be
precluded
by
employer
union
disputes,
and
we
do
consider
that
that
motivated
the
united
states
congress
in
passing
the
1960
act
which
we
contend
is
here
applicable.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
court
of
appeals
decision
occurred
first.
the
act
was
passed
nine
days
later.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
an
independent
ground
on
which
we
rely
and
the
solicitor
general
relies.
that
is
correct.
the
purpose
of
the
united
states
congress
embodied
in
the
statute
should
be
applied
by
this
court.
it
is
the
law
in
effect
at
this
time.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
exactly
correct.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
sound
and
is
supported
by
benedict
and
independently
supported
by
kelly
v.
kosuga
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
doctrine,
yes.
these
claims
of
kaiser
were
not
cognizable
at
the
time
they
were
urged
by
kaiser,
after
all
the
employee
services--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
mr.
justice
white,
this--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--kaiser
would
have
to
honor
a
contract
after
the
board
had
held--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--yes,
in
the
1974
contract.
it
may
not
after
this--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that
is
correct,
after
the
services
have
been
provided.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
future--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
believe
that
in
that
event,
the
employer's
remedies
lie
against
the
union.
they
do
not
lie,
as
we
read
congress's
statute,
against
the
trustees.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
question
isn't
here,
but
we
think
if
it
were
that
you
would...
you
should
hold
that
he
has
to
make
the
payments,
yes.
he
made
the
contract.
congress
said
that
promises--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--we
are
saying
essentially
that
congress
had
a
concern
for
multi
employer
pension
plans,
and
it
wished
disputes
between
unions
and
employers
to
be
thrashed
out
between
them.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct,
and
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--no,
it
would
not...
it
would
not
be
a
waste
of
time,
your
honor,
because
the
board
may
frame,
under
section
10(c)
of
the
nlra,
it
may
frame
remedies
respecting
the
unlawful
act
by
the
union.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--we
think
the...
particularly
after
a
ruling
of
that
nature,
the
employer
would
be
justified
in
rejecting
the
proposed
clause
asked
for
by
the
union,
and
if
the
union
struck,
the
employer
could
sue
for
damages
under
section
303.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
existing
contract
that
is
in
front
of
the
court
is
a
contract
that
began
in
1974
and
concluded
in
1977,
so
the
facts
don't
present,
but
if
he
was
in
the
middle
of
a
contract,
we
feel
constrained
by
what
we
read
to
have
been
done
by
the
congress,
that
the
remedies
would
be
against
the
union,
not
against
the
trust.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
current
contract,
the
1981
contract
does
have
a
purchase
of
coal
clause
in
it.
it
began
in
1981
and
it
runs
through
1984.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
there
was
another
contract
there.
these
are
contracts
for
three
year
terms,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
since
1974,
a
clause
in
this
particular
form
has
been
in
the
contract
which
requires
the
employers
to
pay
a
royalty
on
each
ton
of
coal
handled,
whether
produced
or
purchased,
and
that
clause
continues
in
the
contract
today.
now,
the...
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
bradley
which,
in
addition
to
the
1980
act,
we
believe,
is
an
independent
ground
for
the
decision,
and
i
would
add
that
the
congress,
the
sponsors,
both
sponsors
of
the
1980
act
and
the
floor
debates
in
support
of
their
statement
that
they
were
only
clarifying
the
law,
cited
the
benedict
case,
cited
the
long's
hauling
third
circuit
case,
and
cited
a
further
case,
each
of
which
announces
and
rests
on
the
principles
which
we
urge
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
there
is
no--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--well,
the
contract
provides
that
the
employer
pays
the
same
royalty
essentially
on
each
ton
that
it
handles,
and
if
the
employer
goes
out
of
business,
it
doesn't
pay
royalties;
if
the
employer
purchases
coal,
it
pays
a
royalty
if
the
royalty
hasn't
already
been
paid.
if
it
produces
coal,
it
pays
a
royalty.
as
the
bench
stated
in
the
colloquy
with
my
brother
opponent,
the
likely
inference
is
that
if
kaiser
does
not
purchase
coal,
it
produces
it.
in
any
event,
the
assertion
and
many
of
the
facts
as
mr.
melamed
stated,
are
disputed
here,
they
will...
raised
by
the
employer
on
a
motion
the
employer
made
for
summary
judgment
on
its
80
claim,
a
motion
which
was
denied
by
the
court
and
has
not
been
brought
to
this
court,
those
facts
are
disputed,
and
they--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--the
potential
liability--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
correct.
the
liability--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--the
liabilities
of
the
fund
continue,
and
the
concern
of
those
who
manage
the
fund
and
the
union
is
to
have
funding
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
the
basic
actuarial
measure,
as
mr.
melamed
said,
is
apparently
disputed,
but
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
provisions
that
are
in
the
contract
call
for
the
same
royalty
on
each
ton--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that
is
clear.
those
liabilities
exist.
now,
the...
i
wanted
to
say
that
the
foundation
stone
of
the
benedict
case
is
that
the
trustees
of
the
pension
fund
should
not
have
to
meet
in
a
collection
action
defenses
which
the
employer
wishes
to
raise
against
the
union,
or
which
flow
essentially
toward
union
misconduct.
that
is
what
we
believe
is
present
here.
the
employer's
concern
here
is
with
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
union
in
inserting
this
particular
clause
in
this
particular
contract.
i
want
to
say
a
word
on
the
independent
grounds,
the
third
independent
grounds
on
which
we
rely,
the
kelly
v.
kosuga
case.
that
case,
which
is
urged
to
be
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
divisible
contract,
we
believe,
was
decided
by
this
court
as
an
indivisible
contract,
the
illegality
of
which
was
the
prime
assertion
of
the
buyer
of
the
onions.
the
court
held
the
buyer
liable
to
pay
the
price
for
the
services
delivered.
