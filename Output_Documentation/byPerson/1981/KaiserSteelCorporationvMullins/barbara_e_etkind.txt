ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
but
enacting
the
multi-employer
pension
plan
amendments
act
of
1980,
and
particularly
section
306(a)
of
it,
congress
expressed
its
overriding
concern
for
the
economic
soundness
of
multi
employer
pension
and
welfare
plans.
it
is
our
position
that
in
doing
so,
congress
made
the
policy
decision
to
accord
a
higher
priority
to
curtailing
interference
with
the
collection
of
prescribed
contributions
than
to
incrementally
furthering
the
ends
of
the
antitrust
and
labor
laws
by
one
particular
means,
that
of
permitting
contracting
parties
to
defend
against
suits
brought
to
enforce
their
contract
on
the
ground
of
those
contracts'
illegality
under
the
antitrust
or
labor
laws.
under
the
amendments,
if
payments
are
due
a
contract...
are
due
under
a
contract
to
a
fund,
those
payments
are
protected
without
any
need
to
look
beyond
the
contract
to
see
whether
the
fund
really
depends
on
a
payment
of
those
contributions.
that
is
all
part
of
the
fluctuating
congress's
intent
of
facilitating
the
collection
of
contributions
due
these
funds,
and
not
cluttering
up
the
collection
process
with
other
issues.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
we
believe
that
that
language
does
take
a
gloss
from
the
legislative
history.
in
both
houses
of
congress,
the
floor
managers
of
the
bill
that
was
to
become
the
1980
amendments
delivered
carefully
prepared
and
coordinated
statements
that
were
drawn
largely
from
a
committee
print
that
explicitly
purported
to
represent
the
views
of
the
senate
committee
on
labor
and
human
resources.
the
statements
decried
the
fact
that
simple
collection
actions
brought
by
plan
trustees
had
been
converted
into
lengthy,
costly,
and
complex
litigation
concerning
claims
and
defenses
unrelated
to
the
employer's
promise
and
the
plan's
entitlement
to
the
contribution.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
of
course,
that
is
right,
but
the
legislators
zeroed
in
on
a
specific
standard
which
sheds
light
on
the
meaning
of
that
specific
statutory
language.
the
standard
they
zeroed
in
on
was
that
"federal
pension
law
must
permit
trustees
of
plans
to
recover
delinquent
contributions
efficaciously
and
without
regard
to
issues
which
might
arise
under
labor
management
relations
law
other
than
29
usc
186.
"
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
congress's
explicit
intent
to
protect
the
financial
integrity
of
multi
employer
pension
plan
funds
by
insulating
them
from
defenses
other
than
those
based
on
section
186
sheds
substantial
light
on
the
meaning
of
section
306
(a)
of
the
amendments.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
would
not
take
the
exact
same
approach.
i
think
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
broad
remedial
powers,
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
board
to
fashion
what
kind
of
remedy
it
believed
was
justified
in
this
case.
and
then
it
would
be
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
that
remedy
in
an--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
i
would
assume
that
the
kind
of--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i...
i
doubt
that
it
could,
because
i
think
its
remedy
would
be
more
like
saying...
it
could
require
the
payments...
it
could
require
them
to
not
make
payments
into
the
fund.
it
still...
i
am
sorry.
it
still
could
require
payments
into
the
fund,
but
not
require,
of
course,
the
enforcement
of
a
hot
cargo
clause
if
that
is
what
it
found
the
clause
to
be.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
am
sorry.
maybe
i--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i
am
sorry.
they
could
do
that.
i
assume
that
would
not
be
the
way
it
would
be
effectuated,
but
i
think
they
could--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i
think
they
would
have
the--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
the
board
could
do
that,
but
then
it
would
be
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
because
our
reading
of
the--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes,
i
do,
under
the
1980
amendments.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
yes,
i
do.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
because
i
believe
that
by
the
statutory
language
of
306(a),
that
implicitly
repealed
the
unenforceable
and
void
language
of
section
8(e).
the
gloss
that
i
think
the
legislative
history
brings
to
the
language
of
section
306(a)
is
that
the
legislative
history
refers
to
29
usc
186
as
the
only
possible
defense.
now,
the
outstanding
feature
of
186
is
that
it
declares
unlawful
the
very
making
of
a
payment
itself.
that
is,
the
simple
passage
of
money
from
an
employer
to
a
representative
of
its
employees,
except
in
very
narrowly
circumscribed
situations,
and
similarly,
section
306(a)
can
be
construed,
and
we
submit
in
view
of
congress's
policy
of
curtailing
interference
with
the
collection
of
contractually
prescribed
contributions
should
be
construed
so
as
to
eliminate
all
defenses
to
collection
actions
for
delinquent
contributions
except
those
based
on
unlawfulness
in
the
very
making
of
the
contribution
itself.
the
language
of
section
306(a)
easily
bears
this
reading
of
it,
since
congress
inserted
the
words
"to
the
extent
not
inconsistent
with
law.
"
so
as
to
modify
the
verb
phrase,
"every
employer
shall
make
such
contributions.
"
by
contrast,
congress
did
not
provide
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes,
i
would
believe
so,
and
then
bring
an
action.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think
that
is
right,
because
what
congress's
intent--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes.
yes,
i
do.
the
legislators
were
very...
the
main
thrust
of
the
legislation
was
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
funds,
to
protect
the
working
people
who
are
dependent
on
those
funds,
and
setting
aside
for
a
moment
the
question
of
whether
or
not
those
funds
should
in
fact
be
added
to
or
not.
meanwhile,
the
people
should
go
on
being
able
to
get
the
retirement
and
welfare
funds
they
were
dependent
upon.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
but
then
that
could
be
remedied
in
a
subsequent
action,
but
meanwhile,
not
to
enjoin
the
payment
to
the
beneficiaries.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
statutory
language
is
"any
employer
who
is
obligated
to
make
funds
under
a
multi
employer
plan
or
collective
bargaining
agreement.
"
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
i
am
not
sure
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
i
don't
think
that
section
306(a)
would
extend
to
that,
because
that
is
not
the
type
of...
that
is
not
an
agreement
made
in
the
context
of
the
collective
bargaining--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no,
either
in
a
plan
or
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
am
sorry.
a
multi
employer
pension
plan
were
you
referring
to?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
if
that
were
part
of
a
multi
employer
pension
plan,
or
part
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
then
i
think
those
payments
would
have
to
be
made,
and
then
the
legality
of
that
challenge
in
another
action.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that
is
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
statute
is
applicable
in
this
case.
the
statute
by
its
very
terms
applies
retroactively,
by
the
words,
it
shall
apply
to
everyone
who
is
obligated
on
the
date
of
enactment,
and
also,
there
is
no
manifest
injustice.
there
is
no
injustice
to
holding
the
parties
to
the
terms
of
their
own
contracts.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes,
i
do.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
we
don't
address
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1980
amendments.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
