unknown
speaker
incidentally,
mr.
grimes,
if
it
were
pre
empted,
i
guess
you
don't
get
to
the
commerce
clause
issue.
unknown
speaker
if
the
williams
act
pre
empted
your
statute.
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
grimes,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
along
the
lines
that
justice
brennan
just
asked.
there
is
a
difference...
do
you
think
judge
cudahy
would
have
written
the
same
opinion
had
the
congress
not
passed
the
williams
act?
unknown
speaker
what
would
pre
empt?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
supposing
congress
simply
had
not
gotten
into
this
field
at
all,
and
left
it
to
the
states,
the
same
way
that
it
had
attempted
to
preserve
state
blue
sky
laws
in
the
1934
or
1933
legislation.
do
you
think
that
the
seventh
circuit
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
as
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
a
constitutional,
straight
constitutional
holding,
without
any
action
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
could
have.
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
proper
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
it
to
have
done
so?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
weren't
any
claim
of
statutory
pre
emption,
just
a
straight
commerce
clause
argument,
wouldn't
the
commerce
clause
argument
be
the
same
whether
or
not
the
williams
act
existed?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
was,
if
it
were
the
same,
wouldn't
it
have
been
decided
the
same,
whether
or
not
the
williams
act
was
in
the
picture?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
the
justice
is
asking
you.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
two
separate
points.
unknown
speaker
mr.
grimes,
i
guess
if
you
consider
the
sec's
new
rules
on
the
subject,
you
would
conclude
that
it
was
indeed
pre
empted,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
authority
of
the
illinois
commissioner
to
hold
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
grimes,
supposing
the
illinois
secretary
concludes
that
although
there
has
been
complete
and
thorough
disclosure,
everything
has
been
disclosed
that
could
possibly
be
disclosed,
nevertheless,
in
his
judgment
the
offer
was
inequitable,
what
happens
then?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
is
it
not
clear
that
judge
cudahy
so
construed
it?
unknown
speaker
and
are
we
not
bound
to
accept
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
illinois
statute?
do
we
go
behind
them
and
take
a
second
look
at
what
the
illinois
statute
means?
unknown
speaker
it
is
quite
clear
he
disagreed
with
you,
and
the
fact
that
you
raised
the
point
seems
to
me
kind
of
cuts
against
you
in
a
way.
if
it
was
argued
and
he
construed
it
differently,
that
seems
to
me
all
the
more
of
a
hurdle
for
you
to
overcome.
unknown
speaker
general
grimes,
did
the
secretary
seek
a
stay
of
the
injunction
issue
by
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
address
somewhere
along
the
line
the
suggestion
that
the
case
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
are
you
criticizing
that
it
was
raised
then
for
the
first
time?
unknown
speaker
or
to
anybody--
unknown
speaker
--where
there
is
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
mite
be
held
when
everything
it
did
was
under
the
protection
of
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
an
opinion.
it's
a
flat
injunction
here
that
protects
them.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
that
you
want
to
retain
the
right
to
collect
civil
penalties
for
violation
of
the
statute,
and
that
the
judgment
below
was
just
plain
wrong,
and
you
want
it
set
aside
so
you
can
collect
civil
penalties.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
fact.
mite
never
acquired
any
shares
of
chicago
rivet?
unknown
speaker
it
never
acquired
any
shares
of
chicago
rivet?
unknown
speaker
it
also
agreed
not
to
acquire
any
in
the
future.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
likelihood
that
mite
will
make
any
effort
to
take
over
chicago
rivet
again?
they
have
agreed
not
to.
unknown
speaker
mr.
grimes,
doesn't
that
distinguish
this
case
from
leroy?
there
the
acquisition
had
actually
been
completed,
had
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
here
it
was
not.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
a
promise
that
it
will
never
come
to
pass.
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
really
trying
to
get
at,
what
is
the
basis
of
any
liability
under
the
illinois
statute
in
these
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
have
now
withdrawn
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
wasn't
any
question,
the
acquisition
had
gone
through
and
it
was
claimed
in
defiance
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
state
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
what
you
are
saying,
even
if
you
win
here,
even
if
you
win,
you
could
still
go
after--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
they
have
withdrawn
the
tender
offer.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
civil
penalty
for
doing
what
they
did,
since
they
have
now
withdrawn
it
and
promised
they
will
not
go
forward
with
it?
unknown
speaker
you
can
get
an
injunction,
can't
you.
under
your
statute
it
provides
for
injunctions,
so
if
you
prove
a
past
violation,
at
least
theoretically
an
illinois
court
can
enter
an
injunction
against
mite
ever
doing
it
again,
couldn't
it?
it's
like
a
cease
and
desist
order.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
if
you
win,
if
you
win,
and
have
the
act
held
valid,
you
could
then
go
in
and
say,
we
would
like
an
injunction
against
mite
making
another
tender
offer.
but
wouldn't
you
have
to
show
under
illinois
law
some
likelihood
that
mite
was
about
to
make
a
tender
offer?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
it
is
moot
only
if
the
state
is
deprived
of
its
right
to
collect
a
civil
penalty.
and
you
don't
think
that
is...
you
think
that
saves
it
from
mootness.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
would
be
in
violation
of
the
injunction
if
you
applied
the
act
to
some
other
company?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
in
the
ordinary
case,
if
you
get
an
injunction
and
the
person
against
whom
you
get
the
injunction
comes
into
court
and
said,
look,
i
was
wrong
and
i
am
not
going
to
do
this
any
more,
would
you
just
mind
lifting
the
injunction,
doesn't
the
court
usually
do
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
court
usually
do
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
would
usually
lift
the
injunction,
don't
they?
i
mean,
what
are
we
talking
about
here?
justice
brennan
asked
how
much
money
would
you
get.
a
dollar
and
seventy
five
cents?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you
what
is
involved
here.
they
are
not
going
to
do
it.
they
have
stopped
it.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
want?
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
of
illinois
needs
$10,000?
and
that
is
all
that
is
in
this
case,
right?
do
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
to
send
it
back
to
see,
and
let
the
seventh
circuit
decide
whether
it
is
moot
or
not?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
i
am
trying
to
find
out--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
understand
what
is
involved
here.
suppose
this
company
goes
out
of
business
right
now.
would
it
be
moot
then?
unknown
speaker
yes.
or
dropped
dead.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
where
the
harm
is
out
there.
i
don't
see
what
we
are
blowing
at,
except
$10,000.
unknown
speaker
you
are
enjoined
from
doing
so
against
mite.
unknown
speaker
and
i
would
suppose
if
you
tried
to
bring
it
against
anybody
else
there
would
be
pretty
fast
relief
granted
against
it.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
this
court
thought
it
was
moot,
it
would
not
only
dismiss
but
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
order
the
case
dismissed
in
the
district
court,
which
would
leave
no
judgments
or
opinions
in
force,
in
which
event--
unknown
speaker
--in
which
event,
you
would
be
free.
i
don't
know
what
some
district
judge,
federal
district
judge
would
do
if
some
other
company
sued
to
enjoin
you,
if
he
knew
that
he
was
just
going
to
get
reversed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
it
is
too
bad
john
barnes
isn't
still
chief
judge
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
what,
mr.
berman,
was
the
subject
of
the
public
hearings?
unknown
speaker
before
whom
were
those
hearings?
unknown
speaker
mr.
berman,
as
i
read
the
last
paragraph
of
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
it
doesn't
say
that
there
can
be
no
state
legislation
in
this
field.
it
simply
says
that
the
illinois
statute
does
not
conform
to
either
the
pre
emption
or
interstate
commerce
burden
requirements.
isn't
it
conceivable
that
whereas
perhaps
they
are
correct
about
the
illinois
statute,
perhaps
the
new
york
or
other
statute
might
pass
muster,
even
under
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
if
congress
had
said
in
the
williams
act
there
shall
be
no
review
in
the
states
of
the
terms
of
an
offer,
of
the
fairness
of
the
terms,
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
said
expressly
that
the
states
may
not
do
what
illinois
attempted
to
do
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
the
seventh
circuit
thought
it
was
doing.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
congress
have
that
authority?
to
say
that
expressly?
and
make
it
stick?
is
that
your
argument
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
yes,
but
then
what
about...
would
that
have
any
implications
for
your
present
argument?
unknown
speaker
yes.
certainly
the
shreveport
rate
cases
said
that
congress
in
exercising
its
power
over
interstate
railroad
transportation
could
regulate
to
a
certain
extent
railroad
transportation
simply
within
a
state,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
of
the
colloquy
between
senator
javits
and
senator
williams
on
the
floor
where
senator
javits
asked
senator
williams,
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
not
to
discourage
tender
offers,
is
it?
and
senator
williams
said,
no,
not
indeed.
some
of
them
may
be...
i
am
just
paraphrasing...
beneficial.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
statute
on
its
face
is
consistent
with
the
seventh
circuit's
reading.
it
does
say,
the
secretary
does
not
find
that
the
offer
is
inequitable,
and
how
does
one
read
the
word
"inequitable"
except
to
indicate
some
interest
in
the
fairness
of
the
bargain?
i
don't
care
what
the...
i
mean,
i
don't
know,
i
don't
have
the
briefs
before
the
court;
we
just
have
the
opinion
and
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
of
the
statutory
language
is
certainly
not
manifestly
untenable.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
very
often
that
we
disagree
with
a
court
of
appeals
on
what
a
state
law
is.
unknown
speaker
unless
a
state
court
has
said
it
is
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
did
you
ask
for
an
extension?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that's
right.
was
there
any
request
for
extension
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hulbert,
let
me
ask
you,
supposing
that
congress
had
never
legislated
in
this
field
at
all.
would
you
feel
that
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
is
sustainable
solely
because
the
illinois
statute
is
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
illinois
connection
be
in
that
last
example
that
you
gave?
because
there
are
limits.
i
mean,
illinois
doesn't
say
every
tender--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
might,
with
respect
to
chicago
rivets,
those--
unknown
speaker
--at
least
two
of
them
were
met
more
than
adequately.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hulbert,
don't
your
arguments,
though,
about
extraterritoriality
really
condemn
a
number
of
state
laws,
like
state
antitrust
laws
or
statutes
requiring
corporations
to
use
cumulative
voting,
and
things
like
that,
that
apply
certainly
beyond
the
borders
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
or
how
about
merger
requirements?
unknown
speaker
don't
many
of
those
in
effect
have
extraterritorial
application?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
last
reply
to
justice
o'connor
intimates
that
you
are
arguing
the
case
to
all
the
judges
of
england
sitting
in
westminster,
where
under
a
written
constitution
which
gives
some
powers
to
congress,
leaves
others
to
the
states,
gives
other
powers
to
the
individuals.
i
mean,
it
isn't
a
question
just
of
what
the
nine
members
of
this
court
happen
to
think
should
be
the
proper
mode
of
regulation.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--and
would
you
agree
that
that
doesn't
involve
federal
judges
deciding
whether
the
williams
act
or
the
illinois
act
is
the
better
of
the
two
for
the
protection
of
investors?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that
it
represents
a
different
approach
to
the
whole
problem
as
between
the
federal
and
the
state?
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
to
include
some
other
states
in
that,
then,
too,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hulbert,
certainly
congress
said
it
wanted
to
avoid
upsetting
the
balance
between
the
tender
offerors
and
the
target
companies,
but
does
that
necessarily
mean
that
congress
objected
to
letting
the
states
take
a
different
approach,
and
allowing
them
to
alter
the
balance?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
i
see
anything
in
the
congressional
scheme
that
necessarily
says
to
me
that
although
congress
perceived
that
it
wanted
to
approach
it
a
certain
way,
that
it
was
hoping
to
preclude
the
states
from
taking
a
different--
unknown
speaker
--this
obviously
is
outside
the
record,
but
are
the
economic
facts
of
life,
so
to
speak,
which
a
couple
of
you
have
referred
to,
that
the
longer
a
merger
offer
is
outstanding
and
uncompleted,
the
less
likely
it
is
to
be
completed?
unknown
speaker
or
can
you
just
not
say?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question?
is
there
any
empiric
evidence
that
shows
that
tender
offers
necessarily
are
good
and
should
be
accepted?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
a
tender
offer
necessarily
to
be
favored?
that
seems
to
be
the
philosophy
behind
the
williams
act.
unknown
speaker
is
there
evidence
that
conglomerates
promote
the
social
good?
unknown
speaker
is
there
evidence
that
tender
offers
for
the
most
part--
unknown
speaker
--encourage
conglomerates?
unknown
speaker
so
there
really
isn't
any
evidence,
i
take
it,
any
empiric
evidence
that
suggests
that
the
williams
act,
which
appears
to
favor
the
offeror
or
the
state
legislation,
which
appears
to
provide
more
time
for
the
target
company
to
present
its
views,
which
of
the
two
approaches
is
in
the
public
interest.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose,
however
unwise
the
williams
act
may
be,
if
it
is
constitutional,
then
it
does
displace
any
state
law,
and
that
is
the
end
of
it
for
us,
however
wise
or
unwise
it
may
be.
unknown
speaker
does
not
this
legislative
history
reflect
some
attitude
on
the
part
of
congress
that
there
is
some
utility
and
value
to
the
public
in--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
to
me,
that
standing
alone
is
ambiguous.
it
could
mean
that
congress
just
wanted
to
remain
neutral
as
to
tender
offers
rather
than
encourage
them,
and
senator
javits
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
the
williams
act
was
not
going
to
discourage
them.
unknown
speaker
kind
of
like
a
galepoly.
unknown
speaker
give
me
that
page
again,
counsel.
unknown
speaker
h-2.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
cumulative
voting
statutes
aren't
necessarily
confined
to
residents
of
the
state
which
enacts
them,
either.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hulbert,
did
you
bring
up
the
matter
of
mootness?
you
filed
a
suggestion
of
mootness
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--i
know.
i
just
wanted
to--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
where
would
you
be
with
respect
to
your
position
vis
a
vis
the
authorities
in
illinois
if
we
held
the
case
to
be
moot
and
had
the
judgment
below
vacated
and
the
case
dismissed
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
just
put
aside
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
we
reversed...
if
you
lost
this
case
and
we
reversed
it,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
pre
emption,
where
would
you
be
with
respect
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
whether
it
is...
mootness
or
not.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
don't
think
you
should
pay
because
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
didn't
understand
the
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
need
to
convince
the
court
of
appeals
to
misunderstand
it.
unknown
speaker
what
if
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
that
we
are
going
to
leave
the
subject
of
tender
offers
entirely
up
to
the
states,
and
each
of
them
can
do
what
they
want?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
what
if
illinois
passed
a
statute
saying,
it's
a
crime
to
deal
in
stolen
goods.
could
somebody
come
in
and
argue
and
say
this
prevents
people
in
all
50
states
from
dealing
in
stolen
goods?
unknown
speaker
could
illinois
prohibit
a
delaware
potential
seller
of
a
stolen
good
to
someone
in
chicago,
from
selling
it
to
someone
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
under
your
argument,
would
the
statute
be
valid
if
it
said
no
offer
may
be
made
to
an
illinois
resident
who
owns
stock
in
the
target
company
without
complying
with
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
federal
requirement
that
if
a
tender
offer
is
made,
it
be
made
to
all
stockholders?
in
other
words,
say
you
had
a
statute
such
as
i
propose.
could
an
offeror
make
its
offer
to
everyone
except
illinois
residents?
unknown
speaker
leave
out
certain
states?
unknown
speaker
here
this
wouldn't
escape
the
illinois
statute,
because
this
applies
even
to
transactions
between
a
new
york
resident
and--
unknown
speaker
mr.
grimes,
may
i
interrupt
you?
i
understood
mr.
shapiro
to
say
that
there
were
no
regulations
imposed
on
a
counter
offer
proposed
by
the
target
company.
is
that
correct
under
the
illinois
statute?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
again
about
the...
it
applies
to
solicitation
materials
that
relate
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--initial
tender
offer,
but
then
supposing
they
file
an
entirely
separate
group
of
documents
making
a
brand
new
offer.
would
you
say
it
also
applied
there?
if
management
made
the
second--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
