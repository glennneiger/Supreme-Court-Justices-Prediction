mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
federal
government
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded
that
the
illinois
takeover
statute
violates
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
i
would
like
first
to
explain
why
this
statute
infringes
the
commerce
clause,
and
then
describe
how
the
statute
defeats
congress's
objectives
under
the
williams
act.
ever
since
this
court's
ruling
in
cooley
against
board
of
wardens,
it
has
been
settled
law
that
the
commerce
clause
places
limitations
on
the
power
of
state
authorities
to
regulate
commercial
activity.
the
federal
government
is
empowered
to
regulate
interstate
commerce,
the
flow
of
commerce
among
the
states,
while
the
states
are
empowered
to
regulate
commerce
in
its
local
aspects,
and
when
state
regulation
has
the
side
effect
of
burdening
interstate
commerce,
that
effect
is
permissible
only
if
it
can
fairly
be
described
as
incidental
in
nature.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
could
pass
such
a
statute
under
the
commerce
clause
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
indeed,
your
honor.
rather
than
regulating
locally
and
imposing
only
an
incidental
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
the
illinois
statute
directly
governs
interstate
commerce
across
the
nation
in
pursuit
of
its
local
objective,
and
this,
we
submit,
is
a
complete
reversal
of
the
state's
proper
role
under
the
commerce
clause.
nationwide
tender
offers
for
the
shares
of
publicly
traded
companies
are
quintessentially
interstate
commerce.
the
illinois
statute
dictates
the
circumstances
under
which
that
commerce
may
proceed.
it
governs
offers
by
bidders
to
stockholders
throughout
the
country,
so
long
as
the
target
company
has
certain
connections
with
the
state
of
illinois.
in
the
present
case,
this
statute
would
directly
regulate
the
actions
of
a
bidder
in
delaware
that
wished
to
offer
$23
million
to
stockholders
across
the
entire
nation.
the
illinois
statute
requires
the
bidder
to
notify
the
target
company
of
its
confidential
tender
offer
plan,
and
then
wait
a
minimum
of
four
weeks
before
commencing
the
offer.
the
bidder
must
also
await
the
result
of
a
hearing,
if
a
hearing
is
demanded
by
the
target
company's
outside
directors,
and
the
act
imposes
no
time
limit
for
completion
of
the
hearing.
throughout
this
entire
period,
stockholders
and
arbitraguer
that
wish
to
sell
at
the
tender
offer
price
are
forced
to
wait
and
to
speculate
whether
state
officials
ultimately
will
grant
their
consent.
trading
on
national
securities
exchanges
also
was
affected
by
the
announcement
of
an
offer
which
may
never
take
place,
or
which
may
be
delayed
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time,
and
at
the
end
of
the
entire
process,
a
nationwide
offer
can
be
blocked
altogether
if
state
officials
deem
it
to
be
in
violation
of
local
law.
under
this
regime,
the
commercial
freedom
of
buyers
and
sellers
throughout
the
country
is
burdened.
the
state
of
illinois,
far
from
using
its
own
jurisdiction
as
a
laboratory
for
economic
experimentation,
is
attempting
to
use
the
entire
nation
as
its
laboratory.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
analogy
would
be
if
illinois
passed
a
law
that
attempted
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
buyers
and
sellers
in
other
states
and
impose
penalties
based
on
what
is
done
in
delaware,
new
york,
kansas,
and
in
places
beyond
its
own
borders,
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
statute
does.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
indeed
it
could.
it
could
regulate
a
local
transaction,
but
it
can't
regulate
transactions
beyond
its
boundaries,
and
that
is
what
this
statute
does.
the
decisions
of
this
court
leave
little
room
to
doubt
that
this
is
in
excess
of
the
requirements
of
the
commerce
clause.
as
the
court
stated
in
shafer
against
farmers
grain
company,
and
i
quote,
"the
right
to
buy
in
interstate
commerce
is
not
a
privilege
derived
from
state
laws
which
they
may
fetter
with
conditions,
but
is
a
common
right,
the
regulation
of
which
is
committed
to
congress
and
denied
to
the
states
by
the
commerce
clause.
"
and
ever
since
shafer,
this
court
has
adhered
to
the
view
that
individual
states
may
not
interfere
with
the
natural
functioning
of
the
interstate
market
either
through
prohibition
or
through
burdensome
regulation.
in
a
case
such
as
this,
we
submit,
which
involves
an
attempt
by
a
state
to
issue
commands
to
buyers
and
sellers
far
beyond
its
borders,
there
is
no
need
to
engage
in
a
weighing
of
local
benefits
against
interstate
burdens,
but
even
if
this
kind
of
a
weighing
test
were
appropriate,
the
illinois
statute
would
not,
we
submit,
survive
constitutional
scrutiny.
the
legislature's
stated
purpose
for
this
statute
is
to
protect
the
interests
of
illinois
security
holders
through
a
disclosure,
prohibition
of
fraud,
guarantee
of
withdrawal
and
pro
ration
rights,
and
provision
of
time
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
be
valid
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
it
still
would
have
to
pass
supremacy
clause
analysis,
which
i
will
discuss
later,
and
it
would
not
survive
if
it
had
the
terms
that
the
present
statute
does,
because
it
conflicts
with
congress's
purpose
under
the
williams
act.
even
illinois
investors,
just
like
investors
everywhere,
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
williams
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
believe
that
that
would
be
possible.
there
are
similarities
under
the
blue
sky
laws,
for
example.
the
seller
of
securities
may
attempt
to--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--go
around
the
state
that
has
an
unhospitable
local
regime,
regulatory
regime.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
precisely.
illinois
says
that
if
its
connection
test
is
satisfied,
that
regulations
across
the
country
are
governed.
we
submit
that
illinois
shareholders
already
are
protected
in
these
very
same
areas
covered
by
the
state
statute
under
the
williams
act,
under
congress's
chosen
standards.
the
williams
act
requires
disclosure
of
material
facts,
forbids
fraud,
prescribes
withdrawal
and
pro
ration
rights
for
all
tendering
stockholders,
and
it
effectively
requires
that
the
tender
offer
remain
open
for
between
seven
and
ten
days,
and
the
sec
has
rulemaking
authority
to
flesh
out
all
of
these
requirements.
since
congress
and
the
sec
have
been
vigilant
in
protecting
investors,
including
illinois
investors,
the
additional
protection
afforded
by
this
statute
is
entirely
speculative,
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded.
while
counsel
has
also
suggested
that
illinois
has
an
interest
in
regulating
control
of
local
companies,
this
statute
does
not
address
any
aspect
of
corporate
control
that
is
within
the
state's
jurisdiction.
the
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case
do
not
prescribe
fiduciary
duty
for
management
or
controlling
persons,
but
instead
focus
on
sale
transactions
between
stockholders
and
outsiders
in
national
securities
markets.
this
is
not
an
aspect
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
domestic
target
company
that
traditionally
is
subject
to
local
regulation.
in
reality,
this
statute
regulates
the
business
of
bidders
throughout
the
entire
country,
not
the
internal
affairs
of
local
target
companies.
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale,
if
one
were
to
attempt
to
apply
a
weighing
test
in
this
case,
the
illinois
statute
severely
burdens
both
buyers
and
sellers
in
interstate
commerce.
as
the
senate
report
which
accompanied
the
williams
act
stated,
pre
commencement
waiting
periods
can
delay
the
offer
when
time
is
of
the
essence,
and
when
congress
passed
the
hart-scott-rodino
act,
which
was
intended
to
dovetail
with
the
williams
act,
it
made
the
point
in
the
house
report
that
cash
tender
offers
depend
on
speed
and
surprise
to
be
successful.
congress
and
the
courts
have
recognized,
in
short,
that
pre
commencement
delay
is
a
potent
weapon
to
defeat
tender
offers
and
deprive
shareholders
of
the
opportunity
to
sell
their
shares
at
a
premium,
and
as
the
facts
of
this
case
show,
bidders
under
the
state
regulatory
regime
that
we
are
focusing
on
today
must
attempt
to
comply
with
potentially
overlapping
state
statutes,
all
of
which
have
extraterritorial
coverage.
the
number
of
states
that
ultimately
will
assert
jurisdiction
will
not
be
known
at
the
outset
of
the
offer.
this
increases
confusion,
delay,
expense,
and
opportunities
for
injunctive
orders,
all
of
which
can
severely
encumber
the
planning
and
the
execution
of
a
nationwide
tender
offer,
and
if
more
than
one
state
does
ultimately
assert
jurisdiction,
that
permits
the
state
with
the
strictest
standards
to
set
the
rules
for
buyers
and
sellers
throughout
the
entire
country.
illinois
has
not
cited
a
single
local
objective
that
justifies
these
major
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
in
addition
to
exceeding
the
bounds
of
its
authority
over
local
commercial
affairs,
illinois
has
enacted
a
statute
which
conflicts
with
the
purposes
of
congress
under
the
williams
act.
in
the
williams
act,
congress
exercised
its
plenary
power
over
commerce
to
protect
investors
across
the
country.
when
it
enacted
this
statute,
congress
recognized
that
tender
offers
often
extend
a
valuable
opportunity
to
stockholders,
and
that
they
frequently
serve
a
useful
purpose
by
providing
a
check
on
entrenched
but
inefficient
management.
in
order
to
assure
full
disclosure
to
stockholders
without
discouraging
or
hindering
the
making
of
tender
offers,
congress
adopted
a
carefully
selected
strategy.
to
achieve
its
goal,
congress
struck
a
balance
between
the
interests
of
incumbent
management
and
the
bidder,
and
it
permitted
each
side
to
fairly
present
its
proposals
to
public
investors.
an
essential
aspect
of
this
regulatory
balance
is
the
timetable
which
congress
prescribed
for
tender
offers.
under
section
14(d)
of
the
statute,
a
bidder
may
disclose
its
plan
and
begin
to
solicit
shares
simultaneously.
congress
deliberately
rejected
the
idea
that
there
should
be
a
compulsory
delay
between
announcement
and
commencement
of
tender
offers.
it
concluded
that
this
would
frustrate
tender
offers
and
disrupt
the
operation
of
the
national
securities
markets,
results
harmful
to
the
best
interests
of
the
investing
public.
this
illinois
statute
clashes
with
congress's
timetable
and
upsets
its
carefully
prescribed
balance.
illinois
requires
bidders
to
announce
their
confidential
plans
in
advance
of
the
offer,
and
then
wait
a
minimum
of
four
weeks,
and
indeed,
even
longer,
if
state
officials
so
decree,
and
while
the
bidder
waits,
with
its
hands
tied
by
state
statute,
unable
to
make
a
solicitation
or
to
present
its
views
about
the
offer,
incumbent
management
may
engage
in
defensive
maneuvers
to
defeat
the
offer,
including
the
making
of
a
competing
tender
offer
free
of
any
registration
or
waiting
obligations
under
illinois
law,
and
that
is
precisely
what
occurred
in
the
present
case.
although
economic
arguments
can
be
fashioned
to
show
that
delay
sometimes
has
beneficial
side
effects,
those
arguments
are
quite
beside
the
point
in
this
litigation.
in
order
to
protect
investors
in
the
manner
that
it
thought
best,
congress
adopted
a
schedule
for
tender
offers
and
it
prescribed
a
balance
for
tender
offers.
it
is
not
the
province
of
the
states
to
dislodge
that
balance
or
to
impose
a
schedule
which
conflicts
with
the
schedule
mandated
by
congress.
for
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
that
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
amicus
curiae,
we
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
