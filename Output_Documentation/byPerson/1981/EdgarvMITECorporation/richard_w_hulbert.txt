mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
two
issues
on
the
merits
here,
the
constitutionality
of
the
illinois
business
takeover
act
on
commerce
clause
grounds,
and
the
constitutionality
of
it
on
supremacy
clause
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
invalid
on
both
counts,
and
in
that
respect
aligned
itself
with
substantially
every
decision
by
a
federal
court
on
the
merits
of
those
questions
as
they
have
arisen
with
respect
to
state
laws
such
as
illinois'.
we
submit
that
decision
should
be
affirmed.
the
merits
of
these
questions
have
been
rather
elaborately
briefed
to
this
court
two
years
ago
in
the
leroy
case.
they
have
been
the
subject
of
three
very
lengthy
and
thoughtful
decisions
of
courts
of
appeals
of
the
third,
the
fifth,
and
the
seventh
circuits,
and
they
have
been
the
subject
of
a
mountain
of
commentary
in
the
legal
literature
and
in
the
financial
and
more
practical
press,
if
one
may
put
it
that
way.
one
would
certainly
be
rather
temeritous
in
supposing
that
one
could
add
any
great
deal
of
enlightenment
to
this
question
in
the
half
an
hour
allowed
for
oral
argument.
i
do
think
that
there
are
elements
in
the
facts
of
this
case
which
will
illustrate
in
a
specific
way
exactly
how
these
laws,
this
law,
illinois'
law
does
in
truth
burden
interstate
commerce
and
create
a
good
deal
of
confusion
and
delay,
subject
a
tender
offeror
to
the
prospects
of
the
conflicting
commands
of
different
sovereigns,
and
in
general
act
in
a
way
which,
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
no
state
assertion
of
legislative
jurisdiction
in
the
history
of
the
country
has
ever
purported
to
act.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
and
for
the
reason
that
unlike
illinois
and
other
state
regulation
in
the
blue
sky
area,
the
illinois
statute
is
a
global
regulation
of
any
tender
offer
to
which
it
applies.
it
governs
situations
in
which
there
may
be
not
a
soul
in
illinois
who
owns
shares
of
the
stock
in
question.
it
governs
companies
not
organized
under
illinois
law.
it
purports
to
tell
a
tender
offeror
in
manchester,
new
hampshire,
whether
or
not
he
can
buy
stock
from
a
shareholder
living
in
montreal,
canada,
and
it
is
insisted
that
by--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--there
must
be...
the
statute
prescribes
a
variety
of
alternate
tests.
if
the
corporation
is
an
illinois
corporation
and
either
its
principal
place
of
business
is
in
illinois
or
10
percent
of
its
capital
and
surplus
are
represented
in
illinois...
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
that
means...
the
statute
applies.
the
statute
applies
without
regard
to
anything
else
if
more
than
10
percent
of
the
stockholders
are
residents
of
illinois.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
those
tests
are
met.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
three
of
them
are
met.
rivet
is
an
illinois
corporation,
its
principal
executive
office
is
in
illinois,
and
somewhat
under
a
quarter
of
its
stockholders
are
illinois
residents.
so
there
is
no
question
that
the
statutory
tests
were
satisfied
on
several
alternative
grounds.
what
distinguishes
these
statutes,
and
what
i
think
raises
the
constitutional
question
is
the
insistence
that
regulation
to
be
effective
must
be
national,
indeed,
must
be
international,
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
effective
local
regulation
of
a
tender
offer.
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
right
or
wrong,
but
it
is
insisted
in
the
briefs
amicus
filed
on
behalf
of
the
appeal
here
that
illinois
is
justified
in
regulating
worldwide,
because
unless
it
regulates
worldwide,
it
can't
effectively
regulate
at
all,
and
that
seems
to
me,
one
really
has
to
go
back
to
the
nineteenth
century,
i
think,
to
find
judicial
discussion
of
the
characteristics
of
subjects
appropriate
for
the
national
power
and
subjects
appropriate
for
the
state
power.
there
is
language,
for
example,
in
the
decision
in
cooley
against
the
board
of
wardens
a
century
and
a
quarter
ago
saying,
"whatever
subjects
of
this
power
are
in
their
nature
national
or
admit
only
of
one
uniform
system
or
plan
of
regulation,
may
justly
be
said
to
be
of
such
a
nature
as
to
require
exclusive
legislation
by
congress.
"
what
illinois
has,
on
the
contrary,
proposed
to
do
in
this
case
by
enacting
this
statute,
and
what
every
other
state,
i
think,
that
has
done
so
likewise
proposes
it
has
the
right
to
do,
is
to
impose
an
absolute
veto
on
a
tender
offer
occurring
anywhere
in
the
world
provided
the
jurisdictional
contacts,
and
they
vary
from
state
to
state,
and
one
of
the
issues
that
arose
in
this
case
was
exactly
what
the
pennsylvania
statute
meant
when
it
said
principal
place
of
business
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
am
not
sure
about
antitrust
laws.
i
don't
know
that
a
state
has
really
ever
attempted
to
regulate
on
an
antitrust
basis
apart
from
a
concern
that
the
impact
of
the
transaction
is
local,
and
as
far
as
cumulative
voting
and
other
incidents
of
the
relations
between
stockholders
and
a
corporation,
i
agree.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
agree
that
where
one
is
dealing
with
something
that
can
fairly
be
classified
as
a
matter
of
internal
affairs
of
a
corporation,
it
has
as
a
matter
of
tradition
and
necessity
been
referred
to
state
law,
there
having
been
at
no
time
in
our
history
a
federal
law
of
incorporation,
and
in
the
interest
of
fairness
and
predictability
and
certainty
there
has
to
be
a
law
to
which
questions
can
be
referred,
and
our
practice
historically
has
been
to
refer
those
questions
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
incorporation.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
sure.
they
do.
the
problem
here
is
that
you
can
have
four
or
five
states,
at
least
in
concept,
and
in
this
case
two
states
argued
by
mite,
there
were
two
states
here,
each
of
which--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--that
is
certainly
accurate,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
assertion
by
the
state
of
illinois
of
the
power
to
regulate
on
a
global
basis,
as
it
does
in
this
act,
is
impermissible,
just
as...
answering
your
original
question
as
to
whether
taking
the
commerce
clause
issue
quite
apart
from
the
issue
of
pre
emption
one
would
come
out
where
the
seventh
circuit
came
out.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
that
obviously
does
not
answer
the
full
issues
presented
by
the
case,
because
there
is
also
the
pre
emption
argument,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
these
statutes
are
sharply
distinguishable
from
the
blue
sky
laws.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
certainly
if
one
goes
off
on
the
commerce
clause
issue,
the
williams
act
never
need
be
determined.
it
seems
to
me
on
that
issue,
to
answer
your
question,
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
illinois
act
is
quite
clear,
and
it
has
attempted
to
be
defended
on
the
grounds
that,
well,
a
tender
offer
is
really
like
a
merger
or
like
a
proxy
fight,
and
is
therefore
subject
to
rules
that
can
safely
be
analogized
to
those
that
apply
to
the
internal
affairs
of
a
corporation.
i
think
there
are
three
or
four
answers
to
that.
one
of
them
is
that
the
statute,
which
contains
a
legislative
statement
of
purpose,
says
not
a
word
on
that
subject,
and
while
that
is
obviously
not
necessarily
dispositive,
it
is
surely
somewhat
indicative.
the
location
of
the
statute
in
the
consolidated
statutes
of
illinois
is
not
where
you
would
find
it
if
it
were
a
regulation
of
corporations.
along
with
the
illinois
corporation
law,
it
is
tacked
right
onto
the
illinois
blue
sky
law.
it
applies
to
corporations
as
to
which
illinois
has
never...
no
state
has
ever,
to
my
knowledge,
asserted
the
right
to
regulate
the
internal
affairs.
it
applies
to
corporations
that
are
not
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
illinois
as
to
which
illinois
has
not
heretofore
asserted
any
right
to
control
internal
affairs,
and
lastly,
i
think
it
really
is
not
accurate,
acceptable
to
characterize
a
tender
offer
which
is
a
purchase
of
stock
as
a
matter
of
the
internal
affairs
of
a
corporation.
it
may
give
rise
to
subsequent
relations
that
do
involve
the
question
of
internal
affairs
of
a
corporation,
and
there
are
aspects
of
conduct
associated
with
the
tender
offer
that
presumably
are
covered
by
state
law.
for
example,
the
fiduciary
obligations
of
directors
faced
with
a
tender
offer.
what
may
they
do?
may
they
spend
corporate
money
to
oppose
it?
is
their
obligation
simply
to
make
sure
that
the
facts
are
on
the
table
for
the
stockholders'
decision?
there
is
plenty
of
scope
for
state
law,
and
it
does
no
disservice
to
the
solid
notions
of
state
responsibility
in
the
sphere
of
economic
regulation
properly
assigned
to
states
to
hold
that
in
this
case
illinois
has
gone
much
too
far
simply
on
commerce
clause
grounds
alone.
if
one
turns
to
the
second
branch
of
the
argument,
which
is
the
issue
as
to
pre
emption,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
will
cast
in
some
higher
light
some
of
the
assertions
that
have
been
made
with
respect
to
the
relations
between
the
illinois
law
and
the
williams
act.
it
is
said
that
illinois
imposes
a
slight
delay.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
the
time
this
tender
offer
was
proposed
to
be
made
in
january,
1979,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
it
could
have
been
made
in
seven
days,
and
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
made
in
less
than
eight
weeks,
the
20-day
pre
commencement
period
of
uncertainty
mandated
by
the
law
and
the
20
business
days
that
the
offer
at
a
minimum
had
to
be
kept
open.
in
addition,
there
are
the
hearing
provisions
which
have
been
referred
to,
and
given
the
usually
combative
nature
of
these
transactions,
it
can
safely
be
assured
that
where
a
hearing
can
be
requested
it
will
be.
the
hearing
itself
adds
a
minimum
of
another
additional
five
weeks.
the
ten
days
within
which
the
secretary
is
to
commence
the
hearing
after
he
has
been
asked
to
do
so,
and
that
date
he
is
allowed
to
extend
without
any
stated
limit
of
time.
then
there
is
a
15
business
day
period
after
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
in
which
the
secretary
is
to
render
a
decision,
although
that
period
likewise
can
be
extended
without
any
stated
limit
of
time,
and
then
of
course
there
is
the
time
required
for
the
hearing
itself.
if
these
procedures
were
strung
out
with
any
ingenuity
at
all,
with
half
the
ingenuity
that
was
displayed
in
the
various
maneuvers
that
in
truth
went
on,
you
would
be
confronting
something
16,
18
weeks,
half
a
year,
seven
months,
and
if
one
contrasts
that
on
the
one
hand
with
one
week,
which
was
the
period
under
which
an
offer...
within
which
an
offer
could
be
made
under
the
williams
act,
it
seems
to
me
one
cannot
refer
to
this
in
terms
of
slight
delay.
it
is
a
gross
alteration
of
the
whole
terms
of
the
transaction.
it
ceases
to
be
something
recognizable
to
any
draftsman
of
the
williams
act
and
becomes
something...
a
horse
of
an
absolutely
different
color,
and
indeed
probably
not
a
horse
at
all.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
mr.
chief
justice,
it
represents
a
view
by
the
state
of
illinois
that
on
a
matter
on
which
congress
has
reached
one
judgment,
the
state
of
illinois
is
entitled
to
reach
a
very
different
one,
and
i
don't
see
how
it
is
easily
possible
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
state
judgment
may
stand
in
the
face
of--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--there
are...
the
limitations
of
time
are
not
the
same
under
various
state
statutes.
the
new
york
statute
which
mr.
berman
spoke
of
is
a
very
different
statute
from
that
which
was...
the
illinois
statute
in
issue
in
this
case,
and
one
might,
i
think,
come
to
all
sorts
of
different
conclusions
about
a
number
of
features
of
the
new
york
statute
that
would
have
no
bearing
on
the
conclusion
to
which
one
ought
to
come
in
this
case.
the
question
of
the
hearing
obviously
raises
the
substitution
of
some
administrative
judgment
in
some
degree,
whether
a
true
review
of
the
literal
adequacy
of
the
price
in
somebody's
mind,
but
certainly
those
words
must
mean
something,
and
they
impose
a
procedure
which
congress
did
not
have
in
mind.
there
is
a--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--there
is
nothing
explicit
in
the
congressional...
in
the
legislative
history
that
really
bears...
that
exposes
any
overt
understanding
by
any
congressman
on
how
to
deal
with
these
state
statutes.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
there
was
only
one
of
them
in
existence
when
the
williams
act
was
first
adopted,
and
that
had
been
enacted
in
virginia
two
or
three
months
earlier,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
congress
was
even
aware
of
it,
and
the
spate
of
state
legislation
on
this
subject
has
really
occurred
only
in
the
last
four
or
five
years,
and
it
may
be
that
congress
is
quite
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
these
statutes
almost
invariably
are
knocked
down
on
constitutional
grounds
when
litigation
reaches
them.
congress
has
conferred
authority
on
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
explicitly
in
the
williams
act
to
introduce
regulatory
modifications
in
the
interests
of
investors,
and
to
a
degree
in
recent
regulations
the
commission
has
sought
to
do
so.
i
am
not...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
congressional
exchanges
there
are
do
bear
on
the
question,
and
very
clearly
bear
on
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
thought
that
it
would
be
permissible
state
practice
or
anybody's
practice
to
proceed
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
a
tender
offer
an
immensely
long,
drawn
out
thing
fraught
with
peril
and
therefore
much
less
likely
to
be
made
at
all,
and
if
made,
less
likely
to
be
something
that
a
stockholder
in
the
end
is
ever
given
a
chance
to
accept.
i
don't
know
whether
that
gets
to
the...
i
am
afraid
congress
has
not
been
as
explicit
as
one
might
like
in
expressing
its
views
about
the
state
statutes.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
well,
it
certainly--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--i
think
one
can
certainly
generalize.
the
longer
the
time
it
is
outstanding,
the
greater
the
risk
of
failure,
for
whatever
reason,
and
certainly
the
greater
the
expense.
it
is
conventional
in
these
issues,
as
it
was
here...
it
is
set
forth
in
the
sec
disclosure
document
that
mite
filed,
was
obliged
to
file,
that
certain
lines
of
credit
had
been
established
in
order
to
finance
the
purchase.
those
lines
of
credit
carry
commitment
fees.
those
fees
are
a
percentage
of
the
principal
measured
over
time,
and
the
longer
the
period
of
time,
the
greater
the
expense.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
don't
know
how...
what
one
would
define
as
evidence
that
satisfied
that
standard.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
think
there
is
a
fundamental
philosophy
that
the
existence
of
a
capital
market
unrivaled
in
the
world
has
been
of
enormous
benefit
to
this
country,
reflected
not
only
in
the
stock
exchange
but
in
the
fact
that
securities
can
be
sold
in
great
numbers,
bought
and
traded
freely,
that
mechanisms
to
increase
economic
efficiency
are
of
social
value,
that
the
possibility
that
stock
can
be
bought
in
a
way
that
may
exert
some
impetus
on
management
to
exert
a
more
active
and
effective
role
in
the
management
of
the
corporation
it
seems
to
me
in
concept,
it
would
be
consistent
to
conclude
that
that
was
of
social
value,
and
that
tender
offer,
it
seems
to
me,
promotes
these
several
circumstances.
it
makes
stock
more
salable.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
have
no
evidence
that
is
conclusive
about
conglomerates.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
think
the
question
there
is
probably
more
a
matter
of
what
they
do
than
how
they
do
it.
i
suppose
if
one
were
going
to
be
speculating
about
control
of
conglomerates,
one
would
be
dealing
with
an
aspect
of
social
judgment
that
is
perhaps
more
accurately
reflected
in
the
general
area
of
the
antitrust
laws
than
in
the
question
of
the
mechanics
by
which
stock
is
bought
and
sold.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
well,
congress
has
made
a
judgment,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
and
if
you
accept
what
the
seventh
circuit
and
other
courts
have
inferred
to
be
the
judgment
implicit
in
the
williams
act.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
would
have
thought
that
was
certainly
conventional
analysis.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
it
seems
to
me
clearly
so.
the
exchange
between
senators
javits
and
williams
goes
directly
to
that
point.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
yes,
but
i
think
there
is
another
point
that
i
haven't
yet
managed
to
get
to,
which
i
think
bears
on
this
question
of
how
free
the
states
ought
to
be
regarded
as
having
been
left
by
congress
to
intervene
in
this
area,
and
that
is
the
problem
of
conflicting
assertions
of
state
jurisdiction
over
the
same
tender
offer,
which
arose
in
this
case.
the
tender
offer
which
was
made
by
mite,
a
delaware
corporation
doing
business
in
connecticut
and
indiana,
for
stock
of
rivet,
was
the
subject
of
a
75-page
in
typed
form
disclosure
statement
filed
with
the
sec
pursuant
to
the
williams
act,
and
in
all
the
claims
and
charges
that
were
subsequently
raised
in
the
several
litigations
that
were
brought,
it
was
never
contended
by
anybody,
by
rivet
or
by
the
secretary
of
state
of
illinois,
that
there
was
anything
missing
or
unfairly
stated
in
this
disclosure
document,
or
that
any
further
disclosure
of
any
kind
would
have
been
of
any
use
to
anybody.
the
only
ground
of
objection
illinois
ever
did
assert
was
simply
the
technical
one
that
an
application
for
registration
had
not
been
made.
on
the
basis
of
publicly
available
information,
it
appeared
that
rivet,
since
it
was
an
illinois
corporation
and
had
its
principal
place
of
business
in
chicago,
would
be
subject
to
the
illinois
act.
the
illinois
act
had
been
held
unconstitutional
not
two
months
before
by
judge
collins
in
the
northern
district,
and
it
seemed
really
a
relatively
foregone
conclusion
that
if
the
same
case
were
presented
to
the
northern
district
of
illinois
on
facts
that
these
tender
offers
are
very
much
like
one
another,
there
would
be
almost
no
prospect
that
the
result
would
be
different.
the
period
of
delay
occasioned
by
complying
with
the
illinois
act
and
the
expense
that
would
undoubtedly
be
incurred
in
doing
so,
16,
18
weeks
or
what
have
you,
made
it
obviously
sensible
to
initiate
the
litigation
that
was
initiated.
unbeknownst
to
us,
circumstances
with
respect
to
rivet
gave
rise
to
the
possibility
in
the
minds
of
its
counsel
that
an
argument
could
be
made
that
the
pennsylvania
act
applied,
on
the
view
that
the
largest
single
plant
of
chicago
rivet
was
located
in
tyrone,
pennsylvania,
employing
somewhat
more
than
half
of
the
work
force,
and
producing
somewhat
more
than
half
of
the
total
production,
and
if
that
could
be
fitted
within
the
pennsylvania
statutory
phrase,
principal
place
of
business,
that
in
conjunction
with
what
seemed
obviously
enough
to
satisfy
the
substantial
assets
test,
which
was
the
other
part
of
the
pennsylvania
definition,
a
useful
second
front
might
be
established
against
the
tender
offer
by
making
use
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
and
the
various
techniques
that
could
flow
from
that,
so
that
instead
of
fighting
the
illinois
battle
on
its
merits,
rivet
and
the
secretary
of
state
showed
up
in
court
on
monday,
the
22nd,
and
said...
indeed,
they
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
because
they
were
only
relying
on
the
pennsylvania
statute
at
that
point.
so,
off
we
all
trooped
to
the
snowy
hills
of
western
pennsylvania.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
yes,
exactly.
the
state
court
action
was
removed,
and
other
action
was
brought.
rivet
applied
to
the
pennsylvania
securities
commission
to
take
jurisdiction,
and
all
in
all,
about
ten
days
of
time
was
consumed
in
what
might
probably
have
been
predicted
at
the
outset
and
certainly
proved
in
the
event
to
be
a
fruitless
caper,
and
on
february
1,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
refused
to
extend
any
further
the
injunctive
relief
that
had
been
obtained
in
the
pennsylvania
state
court,
and
so
then
the
scene
moved
back
to
illinois,
where
the
final
determination
with
respect
to
the
illinois
statute
was
made,
as
it
could
have
been
predicted
at
the
outset
it
would
have
been.
one
point
of
interest
on
this
conflict
is
that
in
the
early
posture
of
the
case,
the
secretary
of
state,
who
may
not
have
been
a
pawn,
but
certainly
appeared
to
take
no
action
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
tactical
necessities
of
rivet's
position
from
time
to
time,
asserted
in
court
that
he
was
unclear
whether
he
was
going
to
enforce
the
illinois
act
because
of
the
comity
provision
which
would
have
permitted
him
in
appropriate
circumstances
to
defer
to
another
state
administrator
if
he
felt
like
it,
but
a
day
later
or
so
decided
that
he
would
not
defer
to
the
pennsylvania
act
for
reasons
which
i
think
show
exactly
the
problem
of
conflicting
state
jurisdiction.
at
page
h-2
of
the
record,
mr.
shapiro...
another
mr.
shapiro...
appearing
as
counsel
for
the
secretary
of
state,
explained
that
the
secretary
of
state
had
decided
that
he
was
not
going
to
defer
to
pennsylvania.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
h-2.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
because
of
certain
differences
between
those
two
statutes.
the
length
of
time
the
offer
must
remain
open
was
different;
in
pennsylvania
it
was
17
days,
and
in
illinois
it
was
20
business
days.
that
the
provisions
for
pro
ration
were
not
the
same,
and
that
the
rights
of
withdrawal
were
measured
by
different
periods
of
time,
so
that
from
that
point
on
it
was
rivet's
position,
in
effect,
that
we
were
to
be
subjected
to
two
laws,
the
pennsylvania
act
and
the
illinois
act,
which
at
least
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
was
himself
confident
could
not
be
readily
reconciled,
so
that
he
was
determined
to
enforce
his,
and
presumably
pennsylvania
was
being
urged
to
enforce
its,
and
what
were
we
to
do?
whose
law
governs
the
duration
of
withdrawal
rights?
do
you
apply
pennsylvania
law
only
in
pennsylvania?
do
you
apply
illinois
law
only
in
illinois,
even
though
both
laws
purport
to
apply
everywhere?
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
congress
may
have
intended,
it
did
not
intend
that,
and
the
possibilities...
it
also
seems
to
me
as
a
matter
of
the
commerce
clause
you
cannot
readily
imagine
a
situation
in
which
several
states
are
each
free
to
assert
an
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
over
the
same
transaction.
i
don't
know
of
a
comparable
case.
the
nearest
situation
that
occurs
off...
quickly
is
the
case
where
an
issue
before
this
court
concerned
truck
mud
guards,
and
the
state
of
illinois
had
required
one
kind
of
mud
guard
and
the
state
of
arkansas
prohibited
the
use
of
that
mud
guard,
so
you
were
confronted
with
a
situation
in
which
there
was
no
truck
that
could
run
on
the
highways
of
both
arkansas
and
illinois
without
violating
one
law
or
the
other,
and
this
is
the
case
of
bibb
against
navajo
freight
lines,
and
reading
the
opinion,
one
draws
the
seemingly
clear
conclusion
that
the
court
attributed
considerable
significance
to
the
kind
of
obstructive
value
which
that
sort
of
regulation
has.
even
there,
of
course,
each
statute
purported
to
apply
only
within
its
own
borders.
that
is
not
true
of
these
tender
offer
statutes
along
the
illinois
model.
they
are
not
confined
to
the
control
of
transactions
within
illinois
or
concerning
illinois
residents,
and
i
think
it
is
in
that
regard
that
the
seventh
circuit
reserved
the
question
whether
a
valid
state
tender
offer
statute
is
conceivable.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
agree.
if
you
accept
what
i
think
is
the
very
forced
assertion
that
tender
offers
are
to
be
treated
as
regulation
of
internal
corporate
affairs,
then
the
extraterritorial
feature
ceases
to
be
a
significant
factor
in
constitutional
analysis,
but
even
there,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
got
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
these
statutes
are
not
stated
in
jurisdictional
terms
so
as
to
be
mutually
exclusive.
the
illinois
statute
does
not
apply
only
to
illinois
corporations,
and
the
pennsylvania
statute,
indeed
rivet
insisted,
rivet,
an
illinois
corporation,
insisted
that
it
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
pennsylvania
statute,
and
they
both
can't
apply
if
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
nothing
more
than
the
regulation
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
corporation.
which
one
applies?
if
the
states,
i
suppose,
all
got
together
and
each
agreed
to
have
a
series
of
state
laws
enacted
no
two
of
which
would
apply
to
the
same
circumstance,
you
would
at
least
have
the
possibility
of
knowledge
of
what
law
was
to
apply,
and
you
might
be
able
to
comply
with
it.
the
ali
federal
securities
code,
not
enacted,
but
at
one
time,
i
believe,
had
the
support
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
would
acknowledge
the
right
of
a
state
to
regulate
tender
offers
in
the
circumstance
in
which
more
than
50
percent
of
the
stock
was
owned
by
local
residents
and
they
owned
more
than...
and
they
constituted
more
than
50
percent
of
the
shareholders
and
the
corporation
was
organized
under
the
laws
of
that
state,
and
furthermore,
the
corporation
noted
somewhere
so
that
you
could
find
it
as
a
matter
of
public
record
that
it
was
a
corporation
that
met
those
tests,
and
therefore
was
subject
to
that
state's
law.
that
would
certainly
solve
many
of
the
problems
of...
it
would
solve
the
problems
of
overlapping
and
conflicting
claims
to
jurisdiction
that
now
exist.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
have
raised
it
because
i
felt
an
obligation
to
raise
it.
i
haven't
argued
it...
i
haven't
argued
it.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
i
did
raise
it.
we
felt...
as
i
understand
it,
counsel
are
obliged
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--matters
that
seem
to
suggest
the
case
may
be
moot.
we
did
that.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
where
would
we
be?
i
am
not
sure
how
much
of
life
would
have
been
retrospectively
wiped
away.
the
question
is,
could
they
now--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--proceed
as
if
there
had
been
no
litigation,
and
therefore
proceed
against
us
as
if
we
had
never
gotten
an
injunction
because,
so
to
speak,
retrospectively
the
injunction
never
existed.
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
find
it
very
hard
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
to
resort--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--i
think
we
would,
and
this
is
the
mootness
point,
i
suppose,
although
the
state
argues
that
it
has
been
decided--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--we
would
argue
that
you
can't
fine
us
or
put
us
in
jail
or
exact
penalties
even
if
you
called
them
civil.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
if
we
had
done
nothing
except
for
the--
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
--well,
not
only
we
didn't
understand
it,
judge
crowley
didn't
understand
it
either,
and
he
issued
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
w.
hulbert
and
further,
we
induced
the
court
of
appeals
to
misunderstand
it.
it
seems
to
me...
well,
there
are
very
few
cases,
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
are
very
few,
in
which
people
have
been
prosecuted
for
doing
what
they
did
under
the
protection
of
a
federal
injunction,
because
there
are
very
few
prosecutors
that
believe
that
a
case
for
prosecution
can
remotely
be
made
in
such
circumstances.
the
very
few
cases
that
do
exist
suggest
you
can't
do
that,
and
the
implications
for
constitutional
rights
in
all
sorts
of
areas
if
an
injunction
really
meant
no
more
than
sort
of
a
chip
on
a
wager
as
to
whether
the
law
was
eventually
going
to
be
sustained
in
the
direction
of
the
judicial
pronouncements
that
underlay
the
injunction.
it
seems
to
me
irreparable
injury
would
continue
to
be
irreparable
injury,
and
an
injunction
in
some
sense
would
have
no
meaning,
and
i
can't
believe
that
would
be
the
result
or
that
indeed
in
truth
an
illinois
prosecutor
could
be
found
who
would
think
that
that
state,
which
i
suppose
has
as
much
demand
on
its
prosecutorial
resources
as
any
other,
is
in
fact
likely
to
take
somebody
to
court
to
collect
a
$10,000
fine
for
having
not
bought
any
stock.
thank
you.
