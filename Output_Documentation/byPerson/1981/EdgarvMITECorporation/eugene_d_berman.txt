mr.
eugene
d.
berman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
new
york
believes
that
illinois
through
its
tender
offer
statute
serves,
if
it
is
allowed
to,
with
the
reversal
of
the
decision
below,
a
vital
function
in
shareholder
protection.
that
shareholder
protection
is
similar
to
protections
now
accorded
shareholders
under
some
36
other
state
laws.
those
states
have
decided
that
this
protection
is
necessary.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
experience
of
new
york
under
its
takeover
statute.
new
york
has
had
a
tender
offer
statute
since
1976.
after
the
new
sec
regulations
took
effect
in
1980,
new
york
determined
not
to
be
in
a
conflict
situation
with
rule
14(d)(2),
and
therefore
made
extensive
amendments
to
its
act,
so
that
under
the
new
york
act
there
is
no
longer
a
pre
offer
waiting
period.
new
york
believes
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
regulating
tender
offers
to
protect
shareholders.
since
new
york's
act
became
effective,
there
have
been
44
filings.
twenty-three
filings
were
made
since
the
1980
amendments,
and
of
those,
16
have
been
made
so
far
this
year.
new
york
has
never
ultimately
prevented
a
tender
offer
from
being
commenced
or
consummated
through
administrative
action.
the
function
of
the
new
york
attorney
general
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
full
disclosure,
and
once
that
determination
is
made,
either
that
there
is
full
disclosure,
and
the
offer
is
allowed
to
proceed
on
its
own
course,
or
is
not,
and
an
amendment
is
required,
the
offer
then
continues
in
the
same
manner
as
it
would
under
the
williams
act.
new
york
has
had
four
public
hearings,
two
before
and
two
after
the
1980
amendments.
of
those
public
hearings,
none
lasted
for
more
than
two
days.
it
is
new
york's
experience
that
state
legislation
in
this
area
does
not
frustrate
congressional
objectives
in
the
williams
act.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
there
were
four
public
hearings.
the
subject
in
all
of
them
was
whether
under
the
specific
tender
offer
in
question
the
offeror
had
made
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
all
material
terms.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
those
were
held
before
the
new
york
state
attorney
general.
new
york
believes
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
regulating
tender
offers.
a
tender
offer
is,
after
all,
a
bid
to
acquire
control
of
a
corporation.
in
the
case
before
this
court,
mite
sought
100
percent
of
the
chicago
rivet
shares.
it
sought,
in
essence,
to
buy
chicago
rivet.
the
state
has
a
traditional
interest
in
regulating
affairs
of
corporations
with
respect
to
purchases
of
that
corporation,
analogous
to
merger
transactions
or
major
asset
sales.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
cort
against
ash,
the
corporation
is
a
creature
of
state
statute.
shareholders
invest
in
a
corporation
knowing
that
the
very
existence
of
the
corporation
and
their
relationship
with
that
corporation
will
be
governed
by
state
law.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
as
your
honor
notes,
that
area
seems
to
have
been
reserved
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
opinion.
however,
there
are
certain
aspects
of
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
namely,
what
it
refers
to
as
the
potential
for
delay
under
the
illinois
statute,
which
must
be
addressed.
the
state
tender
offer
statutes
have
one
thing
in
common
for
the
most
part,
all
save
delaware's,
and
that
is
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
neutral
state
administrator
will
look
at
the
offer
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
complies
with
the
statute.
that
is,
whether
there
is
full
and
fair
disclosure
in
the
case
of
new
york
and
illinois.
although
the
seventh
circuit
leaves
the
possibility
of
some
state
statute
remaining
in
effect,
it
does
not
define
what
that
might
be.
for
example,
we
could
speculate
a
state
statute
which
merely
parrots
the
language
of
the
williams
act,
not
being
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
but
in
that
context
there
would
be
no
independent
regulatory
review
of
the
disclosures
in
the
specific
tender
offers
as
exist
now
under
the
state
takeover
statutes.
therefore,
a
key
element
which
new
york
believes
must
be
addressed
is
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
states
to
have
an
independent
regulatory
review
of
the
disclosures
at
some
point
either
prior
to
or
during
the
existence
of
a
tender
offer.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
excuse
me,
if
congress
had
said--
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
--well,
let
me
answer
that
this
way,
if
i
may.
the
states
may
not
do
what
illinois
is
alleged
to
have
felt
it
could
do,
that
is,
regulate
the
fairness.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
well,
congress
certainly
has
not
made
that
argument.
i
frankly
am
not
certain
whether
the
interstate
commerce
authority
extends
to
such
a
point
where
congress--
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
--well,
if
it
did,
then
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
but
that
would
be
a
pre
emption
question
and
not
a
commerce
clause
question.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
we
do
not
question
the
fact
that
congress
does
have
the
authority
to
regulate
commerce
and
to
regulate
commerce
within
a
state,
within
the
commerce
clause
direction
of
regulating
commerce
among
the
states.
however,
in
the
case
of
the
state
tender
offer
statutes,
we
are
given
a
different
situation
entirely.
the
role
of
state
regulation
of
securities
transactions
and
the
role
of
the
state
regulation
of
internal
affairs
of
corporations
is
one
which
has
been
traditional,
and
traditionally
upheld
by
this
court.
it
is
very
different
from
the
instance
of
transportation,
such
as
railroads
or
interstate
commerce
on
highways
going
through
the
states,
and
we
contend
that
the
slight
delay
which
may
be
imposed
by
the
illinois
statute
is
indeed
not
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
it
does
not
prevent
the
tender
offer's
ultimate
consummation.
it
merely
delays
the
tender
offer
until
such
point
as
there
can
be
a
determination
of
fair
disclosure,
and
that
fair
disclosure
is
the
same
disclosure
which
is
required
by
the
williams
act.
in
essence,
the
states
have
felt
in
this
area
that
the
williams
act
is
a
minimum
disclosure
statute
akin
to
the
various
other
federal
securities
laws.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
of
the
williams
act
indicates
that
its
purpose
or
the
purpose
of
the
drafters
was
to
fill
the
gap
in
federal
regulation
of
securities
in
this
area.
at
that
time,
the
tender
offer
was
unregulated
by
federal
law.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
yes.
that
is
true.
there
are
several
benefits
which
may
be
said.
i
believe
in
then
sec
chairman
emanuel
cohn's
testimony
before
congress,
he
mentioned
that
there
are
indeed
some
instances
where
tender
offers
would
be
beneficial
because
the
incumbent
management
is
inefficient,
but
chairman
cohn
realized
that
a
tender
offer
is
in
essence
a
corporate
opportunity
due
to
a
depressed
stock
market
price.
an
offeror
is
able
to
buy
a
bargain.
for
example,
a
stock
trading
at
$25
may
have
an
actual
value
of
$100.
the
mere
delay
in
a
tender
offer
statute
is
not
going
to
impede
an
offeror
from
buying
something
for
$25
that
is
worth
$100.
it
has
been
our
experience
in
new
york,
with
our
statute
in
existence
for
some
several
years,
that
tender
offers
are
not
frustrated
by
our
statute.
indeed,
they
seem
to
be
flourishing,
and
are
dependent
more
on
outside
economic
market
factors
than
on
any
regulation,
be
it
federal
or
state.
a
question
had
been
raised
while
mr.
grimes
was
addressing
the
court
concerning
the
seventh
circuit's
finding
that
the
illinois
statute
regulated
fairness.
new
york
respectfully
suggests
that
the
seventh
circuit
misread
a
statement
in
the
illinois
brief
before
it.
the
statement
by
the
court
that
illinois
defends
the
fairness
review
by
referring
to
impartial
review
by
a
state
administrator
is
not
what
was
stated
in
the
brief
as
is
cited
in
both
the
illinois
reply
brief
and
new
york's
brief
as
amicus.
indeed,
in
those
briefs,
it
was...
in
that
brief,
it
was
specifically
stated
that
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
does
not
interpret
the
statute
so
as
to
regulate
for
fairness,
and
the
brief
specifically
mentions
the
word
"price"
there.
illinois
would
not
say
whether
or
not
it
is
a
good
price,
and
i
believe
there
was
a
misreading
of
that
statement
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
led
to
its
conclusion.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
it
is
not
manifestly
untenable
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
however,
the
illinois
officials,
the
state
attorney
general,
representing
the
state
secretary
of
state,
has
stated
that
this
is
not
how
illinois
will
interpret
this
language.
illinois
will
interpret
this
language
only
as
meaning
that
we
will
regulate
for
disclosure,
not
for
fairness,
and
i
think
this
court
should
give
credence
to
illinois'
statement
of
how
it
will
interpret
its
own
statutes,
there
being
no
decision
by
illinois--
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
--well--
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
--yes,
and
there
is
no
such
decision
in
illinois
court.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
new
york
was
not
involved.
mr.
eugene
d.
berman
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
but
there
was
no...
there
was
no
state
court
action
at
that
time.
this
was
merely
an
administrative
review.
well,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
in
the
absence
of
any
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
