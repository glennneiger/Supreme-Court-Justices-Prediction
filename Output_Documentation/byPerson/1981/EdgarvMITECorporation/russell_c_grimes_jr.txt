mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mite
corporation
initiated
this
action
on
january
19th,
1979,
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
illinois
business
takeover
act
is
void.
mite
alleged
that
the
illinois
act
is
pre
empted
by
the
williams
act,
and
constitutes
an
impermissible
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mite
also
sought
injunctive
relief
prohibiting
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
from
applying
the
illinois
act
against
mite
in
connection
with
its
takeover
of
chicago
rivet
and
machine
company--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--i
think
the--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
preclude
getting
to
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
of
course,
within
the
seventh
circuit
or
below,
it
is
possible,
i
mean,
to
decide
both
decisions...
both
grounds
in
case
one
would
be
reversed
on
appeal,
i
would
imagine.
if
the
williams
act
were
not
passed,
there
would...
you
could
still
have,
i
suppose,
a
pre
emption
ground
even
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
nothing
to
pre
empt
here,
because,
i
mean,
with
the
section
28(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
i
am
not
sure,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
in
that
situation,
the
seventh
circuit
could
have
gone
to
the
commerce
aspect,
if
there
were
no
congressional
legislation
in
the
field.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
i
would
recognize
you
avoid
reaching...
you
know,
deciding
on
the
constitutional
issue
if
any
other
ground
is
possible,
but
of
course,
even
when
something
is
pre
empted
you
are
still
under...
it
would
be
unconstitutional
under
the
supremacy
clause.
i
am
not
sure
exactly--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--i
think
the
commerce
clause
issue
would
be
the
same
regardless--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--i
think
the
commerce
clause
would...
the
commerce--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--yes,
the
commerce
clause
issue
stands
or
falls
regardless
of
the
williams
act.
i
mean,
that
is
there
even...
i
mean,
my
first
argument
is
that
it
is
not
pre
empted
by
the
williams
act,
and
then
the
commerce
clause
analysis
will
stand
or
fall
on
its
own.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
definitely
two
separate
points.
the
seventh
circuit
i
feel
correctly
determined
that
congress
has
not
expressly
barred
states
from
coordinate
regulation
of
tender
offers,
and
even
this
court
has
said
in
section
28(a)
that
the
1934
act
was
designed
to
preserve
state
authority
as
opposed
to
limit
it.
similarly,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
correctly
determined
that
congress...
the
williams
act
is
not
a
pervasive
scheme
of
legislation
from
which
the
illinois
act
could
be
implicitly
pre
empted.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
the
new
rules,
which
of
course
are
not
at
issue
here,
create
a
direct
conflict
with
a
portion
of
the
illinois
act,
in
that
under
the
sec
rule
it
has
to
commence
or
be
withdrawn
within
five
days,
whereas
the
illinois
act
has
a
20-day
pre
commencement.
but
as
far
as...
although,
as
i
still
would
submit,
the
new
rule
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
we
do
have
examples
of
other
very
current
state
amendments
to
their
statutes,
such
as
new
york
and
maryland,
where
you
would
not
have
that
direct
conflict
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
comply
with
both.
that
would
be...
that
specific
portion...
provision
of
the
illinois
act
does
conflict
directly
with
the
new
sec
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
illinois
act
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
achieving
the
full
congressional
purposes
in
enacting
the
williams
act,
in
conflicts
under
the
hines
versus
davidowitz
test.
the
court
of
appeals
had
four
main
objections
that
it
found
with
the
illinois
act.
it
said
that
the
illinois
act
would
substitute
regulatory
control
for
investor
autonomy;
that
a
hearing
could
be
instituted
indirectly
by
incumbent
management;
and
that
the
illinois
act
provides
for
delays
grossly...
potentially
grossly
in
excess
of
those
contemplated
under
the
williams
act;
and
finally,
the
pre
commencement,
20-day
pre
commencement
notification
period.
it
is
the
state
of
illinois'
position
that
the
illinois
act
ensures
that
an
investor
will
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
make
an
informed
decision,
and
it
also
ensures
that
there
will
be
full
compliance
with
the
disclosure
requirements
in
the
williams
act.
this
court
has
said
that
the
sole
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
williams
act
was
to
protect
the
investor
confronted
with
a
tender
offer.
now,
there
are
expressions
of
congressional
neutrality
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
williams
act,
but
i
think
it
is
a...
i
believe
it
is
a
mistake
to
believe
that
general
neutrality
as
opposed
to
setting
an
unalterable
balance...
i
think
those
are
two
different
things.
if
in
fact
the
williams
act
created
a
balance
that
could
not
be
altered,
then
i
think
it
is
the
situation
now
where
the
sec
has
greatly
increased
the
minimum
time
a
tender
offer
must
remain
open
to
20
business
days.
if
it
were
an
absolute
balance
in
the
williams
act,
that
these
terms
were
fixed,
then
i
don't
think
the
sec
could
change
them.
instead,
i
think
it
is
more
a
feeling
of
general
neutrality.
they
don't
want
to
prevent
tender
offers
from
being
made,
but
as
long
as
the
illinois
act
will
not
have
the
effect
of
precluding
the
making
of
tender
offers,
it
can
exist
with
the
williams
act
by
supplementing
the
protection
afforded
an
investor.
with
the
question...
certainly
the
illinois
act
is
neutral.
it
applies
to
the
activities
of
the
target
company
as
well
as
those
of
the
offeror.
its
specific
purpose
says
it
is
to
be
interpreted
so
as
to
strike
a
balance
that
does
not
favor
either
management
or
the
target
company.
it
has
no
exemption
for
a
friendly
takeover.
getting
into
the
seventh
circuit's
problems
that
there
would
be
the
delay
under
the
act
that
would
conflict
with
the
purpose
of
congress,
there
is
no
question
speed
and
surprise
are
to
the
benefit
of
an
offeror,
but
that
doesn't
follow
that
that
is
to
the
benefit
of
the
investor
confronted
with
a
tender
offer.
the
investor's
right
to
make
an
informed
decision,
i
believe
this
is
furthered
when
you
have
reasonable
delay
because
that
investor
then
will
have
an
opportunity
to
see
what
value
the
market
places
on
the
tender
offer
that
has
been
made
for
his
shares.
to
wit,
if
another
company
would
come
in
with
a
competing
bid,
that
would
be
an
indication
of
what
the
true
value
of
his
shares
are.
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
periods
of
delay
in
the
illinois
act
would
hinder
the
making
of
tender
offers,
and
i
think
we
certainly
have
seen
that
in
the
period
of
time
since
the
sec
has
increased
virtually
by
400
percent
from
the
seven
day
minimum
period
when
it
is
a
tender
offer
for
all
the
shares
under
the
williams
act
to
now
20
business
days,
which
would
be
approximately
four
weeks,
there
has
certainly
been
no
slackening
in
the
making
of
tender
offers.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
the
hearing
provisions
of
the
act
which
the
seventh
circuit
found
again
to
be
delay,
and
there
is...
i
would
have
to
agree
that
under
the
wording
of
the
act,
incumbent
management
perhaps
indirectly
could
cause
a
hearing
to
be
held
as
required
by...
if
it
is
10
percent
of
the
shareholders
or
a
majority
of
the
outside
directors.
now,
the
securities
commissioner
is
there
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
illinois
residents
who
are
shareholders.
he
is
not
going
to
be
a
pawn
of
either
the
target
company
or
the
offeror.
the
act
does
contain
time
limits,
although
it
says
that
the
secretary
would
have
the
power
to
extend
them
if
necessary
like
for
the
protection
of
illinois
offerees.
but
the
point
is,
if
the
secretary
conducts
a
hearing,
if
he
sees...
the
purpose
of
the
illinois
act,
to
ensure
that
there
has
been
the
full
disclosure,
and
at
that
point
the
secretary
isn't
going
to
be
subject,
and
i
don't
think
we
could
assume
that
the
secretary
is
going
to
be
a
pawn
of
the
target
company.
the
hearing
at
a
very
early
time,
much
as
if...
if
the
target
company
presently
would
go
into
the
district
court
to
seek
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
anything
else.
i
think
it
is
the
same
thing
being
achieved
by
having
a
hearing
at
an
early
stage
to
see
that
the
williams
act
or
the
disclosure
under
the
illinois
act
has
been
made,
and
in
that
event
it
is
not
going
to
be
an
obstacle
to
the
tender
offer
going
ahead.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
okay.
this
provision
is
the
one
that
the
second
circuit
said
that
it
found
most
objectionable.
first,
i
would
point
out,
the
secretary
has
contended,
our
position
has
been
throughout
this
litigation,
that
he
doesn't
have
the
power
to
pass
on
the
substantive
fairness
or
the
amount
of
the
offer.
i
did
include
a
case
in
my
brief,
an
illinois
supreme
court
case,
which
said...
well,
first
of
all,
to
give
you
the
language,
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
deny
registration
if
he
finds
that
a
takeover
offer
is
"inequitable
or
would
work
or
tend
to
work
a
fraud
or
deceit.
"
i
did
argue
that
this
should
be
construed
in
the
conjunctive
as
opposed...
the
"or"
to
be
construed
"and",
that
it
is...
fraud
or
deceit.
now,
i
recognize
that
certainly
in
more
traditional
state
blue
sky
law,
where
they
do
pass
on
substantive
fairness
and
"inequitable"
is
used
in
that,
that
it...
i
mean,
that
this
could
be
reasonably
construed
as
passing
on
substantive
fairness.
i...
we
contend,
though,
that
that
is
counter
to
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
judge
cudahy
in
his
opinion
didn't
even
point
out
that
we
argued
that
it
didn't
entitle
the
secretary.
i
cite
in
my
brief
in
response,
in
my
reply
brief
here,
i
cited
the
portion
of
our
brief
in
the
seventh
circuit
where
we
argued
that
it
did
not
possess...
we
do
not
possess
this
power.
the
seventh
circuit
didn't
comment
on
that.
he
quoted
a
different
portion.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
the
point
being
that
we
don't
feel
we
have
the
power
to
pass
on
the
substantive
fairness.
the
illinois
act
does
have
a
severability
provision.
we
don't
contend...
we
think
that
is
counter
to
the
purpose
of
the
williams
act
to
pass
on
the
substantive
fairness.
that
is
the
investor's
decision,
adequate
time,
full
disclosure,
and
ensure
that
at
an
early
stage.
but
in
getting
back
to
what
i
was
saying
about
more
like
a
traditional
state
blue
sky
law,
i
mean,
that
is
a
different
situation.
if
a
new
issuing
is
being
made
in
illinois,
and
an
investor
is
putting
up
dollars
for
a
stock
certificate,
you
have
an
inherent
risk
that
you
could
lose
everything,
whereas
i
think
a
cash
tender
offer
is
a
different
situation.
the
illinois
investor
is
giving
up
his
share
of
stock
for...
well,
if
it
is
a
cash
tender
offer
for
all
the
shares...
or
some
certain...
i
would
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
illinois
act,
unless
it
could...
you
know,
the
illinois
supreme
court
decision
is
authority
that
"or"
can
be
construed
as
"and",
and
in
this
situation
i
feel
that
it
would
be
counter
to
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
have
the
power
of
substantive
review,
of
the
fairness,
substantive
fairness
review.
if
that
power
is
there,
it
is
one
that
the
secretary,
in
the
position
of
the
attorney
general's
office,
is
that
the
legislature
didn't
intend
that.
if
it
did,
i
don't
see
that
that
could
withstand
scrutiny.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
no,
it
did
not
seek
a
stay.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
there
had...
i
filed
the
notice
of
appeal
in
this
case.
some
time
after
we
filed
the
notice
of
appeal,
that...
of
course,
then
when
mite
withdrew
its
tender
offer...
i
know
in
prior
litigation
that
happened
a
couple
months
before
this
there
had
been...
a
stay
was
sought
there
in
daylin...
or
uarco
versus
daylin.
stay
was
sought
and
denied
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
also,
i
believe,
denied
by
this
court.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
yes,
i
will
be
glad
to
address
it.
the
main
reason
why
i
feel
that
this
case
is
not
moot...
this
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
mite
in
the
response
to
the
jurisdictional
statement...
is
this.
at
present,
the
secretary
of
state
is
still
permanently
enjoined--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--no.
no,
no,
but
i
am
just
pointing
out
that
the
seventh
circuit,
although
it
addressed
it,
it
was
not
argued
there,
but...
because,
i
mean,
i
realize
it
makes
no
difference
when
it
is
raised,
as
to
something
like
mootness.
but
at
present
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
is
enjoined
from
applying
the
illinois
business
takeover
act
against
mite
corporation.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
the
specific...
the
specific
injunction
was--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--right.
it
would
not
have
been
enforced
in
the
actions,
but
back
to
that
question.
if
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
would,
for
example,
bring
an
action
seeking
civil
penalty
against
mite
for
publishing
its
tender
offer
in
the
wall
street
journal
on
february
5th,
1979,
after
it
obtained
the
injunctive
relief,
the
secretary
of
state
would
be
in
contempt
of
that
permanent
injunction.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
i
would
still...
i
am
arguing,
at
least
i
argued
in
my
reply
brief
that
the
act
provides
for
both
criminal
and
civil
penalties.
since
it
provides
for
civil,
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
obviously
to
reach
any
consideration
of
criminal.
most
of
the
cases
mite
cited
in
its
reply
brief
for
all
of
them
we
are
dealing
in
a
situation
of
criminal
penalties.
in
one
case
cited
by
them,
kratz
versus
kratz,
though,
the
court
in
that
held
that
the
fact
that
it
does
not
follow
that
in
a
civil
case
reliance
upon
judicial
opinion
instructing
that
the
conduct
is
legal
must
be
available
as
a
defense
in
a
civil
case,
and
we
have...
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--well,
but
in
leroy
versus
great
western
united
corporation,
they
had
completed
their
tender
offer
after
obtaining
injunctive
relief,
but
this
court
said,
that
acquisition
did
not
moot
the
case,
however,
because
the
question
whether
great
western
has
violated
idaho
statute
will
remain
open
unless
and
until
the
district
court's
judgment
is
finally
affirmed.
well,
they--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--we
are
currently
enjoined
from
bringing
an
action
for
civil
penalties.
only
if
we
prevail
in
this
court
can
we
then
bring
that
action.
we
currently
are
enjoined
from
doing
so.
i
feel
that
if--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--mite
withdrew
its
tender
offer
on
march
5th
on
its
own.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
correct.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
with
their...
their
agreement,
yes,
with
chicago
rivet.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
they
made
an
agreement
with
chicago
rivet
that
when
they...
they
had
a
proposed,
i
guess,
amendment
to
their
tender
offer
for
$31
a
share,
and
that
if
for
any
reason
they
didn't
go
ahead
with
that
they
agreed
not
to
make
a
future
attempt.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
the
acquisition
had
been
completed.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
but
the
fact--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--i
agree
that--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--the
basis
for
the
liability
would
have
been
making
the
tender
offer
without
getting
it
registered
under
the
illinois
act.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
even
though
they
have
now
withdrawn
it,
they
made
it
without
getting
it
registered
under
the
illinois
act.
they
were
able
to
do
so
on
the
basis
of
their
injunctive
relief,
but
we
are
still
dealing
with
the
civil
sort
of
penalty,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
is
much
different,
because
in
leroy
they
acquired--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--but
the
fact
that
they
acted
under
an
injunction
in
leroy
wouldn't
have
insulated
them
if...
let's
assume
there
had
been
a
decision
on
the
merits
in
this
court,
you
know,
then
it
would
have
been
proper,
and
that
there
had
been
a
decision
in
the
lower
court
to
reverse.
then
i
think
that
there
would
definitely
be
effects
of
whether
they
might
even
have
to
rescind
the
sales
they
purchased,
or
possibly.
there
are
provisions
for
such
civil
things.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
we
can
bring
an
action
against
mite.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
but
they...
on
the
basis
of
that,
it
was
their
own
decision
to
withdraw
it.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--well,
but
the
act
has
been
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
here
they
have
agreed
never
to
make...
or
they
have
agreed
not
to
acquire.
i
think
on
that
there
would
be
problems,
but
i
am
still
saying
that
we
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
for
civil
penalties.
we
are
enjoined
from
doing
so
presently,
and
if
and
only
if
this
court
would
reverse
the
seventh
circuit
on
the
merits
could
we
bring
that
action.
i
am
suggesting
that
what
mite
is
arguing
by
way
that
it
is
moot
is
that
they
ultimately
might
have
a
defense
when
we
would
bring
that
action,
and
i
think
that
would
be
an
advisory
opinion,
to
say
that
they
would
have
a
defense
on
the
merits,
or
that
they
would
ultimately
prevail.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
i
think
that
saves
it
from
mootness
that
we
are
presently
enjoined.
the
act
has
been...
you
know,
we
can't
apply
the
act
against
mite,
although
they
were
able
to
go
ahead
with
their
publishing
of
the
tender
offer
without
getting
it
registered.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
the
injunction
itself
only
applied
to
the
secretary
of
state,
mite,
and
chicago
rivet.
there
is
a
declaratory
relief
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
affirmed.
the
secretary
of
state
has
not
been
enforcing
the
illinois
act
pending...
because
of
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
it
depends,
i
suppose--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--the
court
would
lift
the
injunction,
but
a
person
can
be
damaged
in
a
private
case;
if
an
injunction
is
improperly
issued,
there
would
be
presumed
damages.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
no,
it's--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--$10,000
per
violation
for
the
commission
of
any
act
herein
deemed
to
be
illegal.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
i
imagine
that
is
what
it
would
be
brought
for.
i
don't
know
if
we
would
recover
it.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
i
agree
at
this
point,
but
if
we
can't--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--the
seventh
circuit
decided
it
is
not
moot.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
they
said
that
the
fact
that
we
could
bring
criminal
and
civil...
an
action
for
criminal
and
civil--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--if
mite
went
out
of
business?
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
the
fact
is
that
we
could
not
bring
that
action
today.
we
are
enjoined
from
doing
so.
if
we
were--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--against
mite.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
they
haven't
enforced
the
act
because...
i
mean,
they
have
had
calls,
i
mean,
when
there
have
been
other
tender
offers,
but
with
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
the
act
has
been
obviously...
it
cannot
be
enforced
in
light
of
that.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
yes.
well,
if
this
court
found
it
to
be
moot,
it--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
--i
will
let
mr.
berman--
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
a
couple
of
remarks,
your
honor.
mr.
shapiro
said
on
a
couple
of
occasions
that
congress
struck
a
balance,
that
the
williams
act
already
protects
shareholders.
again
we
are
going
back
to
this
absolute
balance,
and
we
come
back
to
the
fact
that
the
sec
even
has
seen
fit
to
quadruple
this
balance.
i
would
point
out
that
under
the
williams
act
we
are
focusing
on
the
investor.
i
think
that
the
fact
congress
at
times
has
amended
the
williams
act,
has
not
seen
fit
to
change
that.
the
illinois
act
covers
the
activities
of
the
target
company
on
a
solicitation
for
or
against.
a
tender
offer
must
be
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
state.
it
is
clear
that
the
illinois
act
has
incidental
extraterritorial
effect,
but
in
order
to
protect
the
illinois
residents
who
are
shareholders,
that
all
shareholders
will
receive
the
same
protections.
now,
in
this
case
here
there
is
not
a
situation
where
there
were
two
states
who
were
invoking
their
tender
offers.
the
pennsylvania
securities
commission
declined
to
take
jurisdiction
with
the
pennsylvania
act
over
this
offer.
the
secretary
of
state,
as
well
as
having
the
comity
provision,
any
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
they
can
accept
the
federal
filing
of
the
14(d)
as
compliance
with
the
state
act.
and
certainly
here
we
have
a
situation
with
chicago
rivet,
an
illinois
corporation,
its
principal
executive
offices
in
illinois,
27
percent
of
the
shareholders,
43
percent
of
the
outstanding
shares
held
by
illinois
residents.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
the
way
this
came
up,
the
illinois
act
initially
as
it
defines
a
tender
offer
does
not
cover
when
an
issuer
is
purchasing
its
own
shares,
but
i
am
arguing
that
the
illinois
act
covers
all
solicitations,
and
i
cited
that
in
the
reply
brief,
requires
that
any
solicitation
of
the
target
company
management
either
favoring
or
for
the
rejection
of
a
tender
offer
must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state.
so,
with
the
chicago
rivet's
counteroffer
here
where
they
recommend...
if
they
are
recommending
that
mite's
not
be
accepted,
that
was
required
to
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
under
the
illinois
act.
it
applies
to
solicitation
material
by
both
sides.
my
point
with
chicago
rivet,
that
certainly
as
an
illinois
corporation
the
tender
offer
is
for
takeover
of
control.
it
is
like
a
merger,
a
proxy
solicitation.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
tender
offer.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
well,
i
believe
when
a
tender
offer
is...
my...
the
secretary's
interpretation,
i
believe,
would
apply
there,
because
in
the
first
instance,
if
there
is
a
solicitation
by
an
issuer
to
purchase
its
own
shares,
you
are
not
having
a
transfer
of
control
or
all
the
other
elements.
mr.
russell
c.
grimes,
jr.
but
if
you
have
the...
you
have
a
tender
offer,
you
have
a
target
company,
if
the
target
company
then...
and
if
they
solicit
their
own
shares
without
commenting
on
the
tender
offer,
i
would
still
think
that
would
be
within
the
gamut
or
within
the
scope
of
the
act
there,
because
it
is
not
that
situation
where
they
are
initially
just
purchasing
their
own
shares.
it
is
in
reaction
to
a
tender
offer.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
