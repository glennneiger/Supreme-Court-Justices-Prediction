mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit,
where
a
three-judge
panel
rendered
a
plurality
decision
containing
a
vigorous
dissent,
with
the
court
afterwards
split
five
to
five
on
en
banc
consideration.
although
this
case
involves
the
guarantee
of
freedom
of
expression
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution,
it
does
not
involve
the
utterance
of
either
pure
or
symbolic
speech
by
any
of
the
plaintiff
respondents
in
any
manner.
it
involves
the
alleged
right
of
five
public
school
students
to
receive
the
contents
of
nine
books
removed
from
the
island
trees
public
school
libraries
and
curriculum
six
years
ago
by
the
petitioner
school
board.
the
books'
contents
have
been
described
by
judge
mansfield,
dissenting
in
the
court
below,
as
containing,
with
one
exception,
and
i
quote,
"indecent
matter,
vulgarities,
profanities,
explicit
descriptions
of
sexual
relations,
some
perverted,
or
disparaging
remarks
about
blacks,
jews,
or
christ.
"
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
think
that
it
makes
very
much
difference
what
is
in--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--it
makes
a
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
is
in
them,
but
i
do
think
they
must
be
taken
as
a
whole,
and
each
board
member
did
read
the
full
volumes
that
were
involved,
but
it
was
these
alleged
profane,
vulgar,
indecent
materials
that
caused
their
initial
concern,
and
i
am
assuming
caused
the
final
action
from
plaintiff.
i
am
aware,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
are
many
other
books
that
do
contain
in
varying
degrees
some
vulgarities.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
one
of
them
in
still
in
school,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
until
this
june,
and
will
assumedly
graduate
in
june.
there
is
a
potential
question
of
mootness.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
the
resolution
of
the
board
of
education,
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
was
worded
so
that
the
books
were
to
be
removed
from
the
curriculum
and
from
the
libraries.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
the
issue
of
a
teacher
assigning
that
book
for
outside
reading
never
arose.
there
has
been
agreement
by
means
of
a
9-g
statement
that
there
has
never
been
any
threat
of
or
discipline
of
any
teacher
or
staff
member
with
respect
to
these
actions,
nor
would
there
be.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
mr.
justice
powell,
the
oldest
was,
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
a
senior
at
the
time,
and
the
plaintiffs
were
each
year
down
from
that,
so
i
am
assuming
roughly
17,
16,
15,
14,
and
13.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
they
were,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
it
did
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
there
were.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
there
were
some
of
these
books
in
the
junior
high
school
libraries
also.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
it
would
show
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
they
are...
there
are
seven
members
on
this
school
board.
it
is
a
new
york
state
school
board.
they
are...
two
are
elected
each
three
years.
they
are
three-year
terms
that
they
serve.
at
one
time
three
are
elected.
i
would
state
to
the
court,
too,
whether
it
is
of
any
import,
that
five
of
the
seven
members
are
still
on
that
board
six
years
after
the
events
complained
of.
the
respondents
have
alleged
merely
that
the
school
board
used
its
own
social,
moral,
and
political
values,
and
did
not
utilize
educational
criteria
in
arriving
at
their
decisions
with
regard
to
the
removal
of
these
books.
the
respondents
have
stated
that
the
board
is
promoting
a
favored
set
of
values.
it
most
certainly
and
assuredly
is.
the
transmission
of
the
moral,
social,
and
political
values
of
that
community
to
the
students
in
that
school
board's
charge
is
one
of
their
primary
functions.
it
is
a
responsibility
and
duty
of
that
school
board.
the
doctrine
of
content
neutrality
flies
in
the
face
of
this
basic
mission,
which
i
feel
is
a
mission
of
the
nation's
16,000
school
districts.
they
are
pluralistic
school
systems.
they
are
diverse.
they
are
very
different,
vastly
different,
each
from
the
other,
some
naturally
more
like
others,
but
they
are
very,
very
much
pluralistic.
a
true
pall
of
orthodoxy
will
settle
upon
the
nation's
school
districts
if
they
are
not
permitted
to
set
themselves
apart
and
be
distinctive
with
regard
to
value
emphasis
by
means
of
different
curricular
choices.
this
ability
to
tailor
local
programs
to
local
needs
is
healthy,
and
if
it
involves
favoring
certain
values
over
others,
it
should
not
require
the
intercession
of
the
federal
judiciary,
which
has
been
occurring
with
increasing
frequency,
in
part
because
of
the
tremendous
conflict
among
the
circuits
of
the
nation.
mr.
justice
powell
has
seen
the
importance
of
this
and
stated,
and
i
quote,
that
"no
area
of
social
concern
stands
to
profit
more
from
a
multiplicity
of
viewpoints
and
from
a
diversity
of
approaches
than
does
public
education.
"
although
this
prescriptive
model
of
public
education,
this
transmission
of
community
values
that
i
have
referred
to,
is
at
the
foundation
of
our
arguments
as
contrasted
with
the
marketplace
of
ideas
model,
which
is
one
that
holds
forth
in
the
nation's
universities
and
colleges
and
is
quite
distinct--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--this
broad
authority
to
place
on
a
shelf
resting
or
vested
in
a
school
district.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
even
though
it
is--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--i
would
say
that
a
school
board
would
be
subject
to
the
federal
and
state
laws
with
regard
to
obscenity,
and
although
they
might
have
the
power,
they
certainly
would
be
totally
irrational
and
would
subject
themselves
to
criminal
penalties,
but
do
they
have
the
power?
i
would
think
that
they
might
have
the
power,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
do
not
find
any
distinction
whatsoever
with
regard
to
the
power
to
either
put
in
or
to
take
out.
there
is,
i
know,
in
a
number
of
the
circuit
court
rules
a
concept
of
tenure
once
a
book
is
on
a
library
shelf.
i
posit
that
they
have
equal
power
to
either
select
curriculum
materials
or
to
remove
curriculum
materials.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
most
certainly
am
not
asserting
an
absolute
right,
and
there
are
a
number
of
places
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
will
articulate
them
as
best
i
can.
one
would
be
where
there
is
a
comprehensive
and
obvious
attempt
to
sanitize
a
whole
body
of
thought,
a
whole
doctrine
of
thought.
the
epperson
case
referred
to
that
measure,
in
addition
to
referring
to
a
sharp
and
direct
implication
with
constitutional
values,
an
attempt
to
establish
a
rigid
and
exclusive
indoctrination,
and
exclusive
is
important.
in
this
instance,
we
are
dealing
with
nine
books
out
of
thousands
and
thousands
in
this
school's
libraries.
an
attempt--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--absolutely
not.
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
think
it
is
obvious
from
the
record
that
that
is
not
the
attempt.
i
don't
think
that
you
could
remove
all
books
that
pertain
to
a
particular
religion,
to
a
particular
political
party.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
you
cannot
favor--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--i
think
if
that
possibly
were
the
only
book,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
the
library
pertaining
to
a
substantive
ideology,
you
might
have
some
constitutional
concern.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
then
you
are
into
the
possibility
of
mixed
motivation,
which
the
mount
healthy
case
addressed,
and
it
is
possible
that
if
there
were--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--oh,
i
am
sorry.
i
was--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--all
right.
i
was
responding
to
justice
stevens--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--with
regard
to
what
i
felt
was
the
question
concerning
the
possibility
of
mixed
motivation,
where
if
there
were
disparaging
remarks
in
this
book
concerning
blacks,
jews,
or
whomever,
whether
that
would
be
a
valid
reason
for
removing
it,
even
though
it
were
the
only
book,
mr.
justice,
that
contained
a
certain
ideology,
was
this
the--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
if
it
made
that
standard,
i
think
a
school
board
would
certainly
have
that
right,
because
it
is
not
banning
an
ideology,
it
is
not
banning
a
doctrine
of
thought.
it
is
not--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--i
would
hope
that
there
would
not
be,
at
least
in
the
face
of
a
complaint
and
a
9-g
statement
similar
to
that
in
this
case,
because
what
you
are
assuming
obviously
then
is
the
next
step,
being
a
trial.
there
are
possibly
circumstances
where
that
would
be
justiciable
and
where
it
would
raise
a
constitutional
issue,
but
justice...
judge
mansfield
did
not
state
that
any
one
book
had
all
of
those
elements
in
them.
i
have
read
the
books,
and
the
elements
referred
to
by
justice...
judge
mansfield
had
varying
of
those
things
that
he
was
disparaged
about,
but
no
one
book
had
a
combination
of
disparaging
remarks
about
blacks,
jews,
and
christ.
one
did
refer
to
christ
disparagingly.
one
or
two
referred
to
blacks
disparagingly,
and
so
forth,
and
there
were
obscenities
and
profanities
throughout
all.
so,
there
was
a
mixed
bag
with
regard
to
these
volumes.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
he
said,
with
one
exception,
and
that
exception
is
one
that
contained
a
modest
proposal,
by
jonathan
swift,
that
the
board
felt
in
bad
taste,
and
this
board
is
a
seven-man
board.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
would
ask
the
court
first
to
hold
that
the
mere
allegation
that
the
board
or
any
board
followed
its
own
social,
moral,
and
political
values
in
making
curricular
decisions
without
further
would
not
be
justiciable.
i
would
also
add
that
the
rule
that
probably
should
be
followed,
aside
from
the
balancing
of
conflicting
interests,
and
i
certainly
admit
that
there
are
many
important
interests,
but
they
are
conflicting
in
this
case,
would
be
that
of
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
state
function.
certainly,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
prove
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
public
forum.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
disciplinary
actions
against
anyone
as
a
result,
say,
of
teaching
a
proscribed
volume.
we
are
dealing
with
a
very,
very
unique
environment,
that
of
the
public
school.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
no,
justice
o'connor.
the
complaint
referred
to
moral,
social,
and
political
values,
and
failure
to
follow
educational
criteria.
my
position
is
initially
that
an
examination
of
the
record,
and
if
the
justices
choose,
the
books
themselves,
will
indicate
that
there
is
absolutely
no
political
motivation.
however,
political
in
its
good
sense
is
not
a
prohibited
action.
politics
is
the
study
of
government.
in
the
dictionary,
the
third
definition
of
the
word
"political"
is
one
that
is
pejorative,
but
certainly
the
mere
fact
that
a...
schools
are
instruments
of
political
socialization
for
the
students
in
them,
so
the
mere
existence
or
the
mere
allegation
of
the
word
"political"
does
not
taint
this
action.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
the
normal
selection,
justice
powell,
at
least
that
with
which
i
am
familiar,
and
i
represent
more
than
one
school
district,
is
basically
to
permit
the
professional
staff
from
lists
submitted
by
publishers
and
professional
journals
to
make
these
selections.
this
is
the
customary
way.
but
i
would
immediately
remind
mr.
justice
powell
of
the
fact
that
in
the
chelsey
case,
which
is
a
lower
court
case,
but
in
the
chelsey
case,
a
federal
judge
found
fit
to
restore
what
i
do
think
most
of
the
court,
if
not
all
of
the
court,
will
agree
was
a
scurrilous
vulgar
poem
to
the
school
shelves,
and
in
that
case
the
librarian,
who
selected
from
1,000
paperbacks
the
paperback
containing
this
poem,
had
not
even
read
the
poem.
so,
i
don't
want
you
to
endow
faulty
selection
processes
with
constitutional
protection.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
normally,
it
does...
it
does
not.
it
does
select
textbooks,
and
most
textbooks--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--most
textbooks--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--yes,
but
most
textbooks
also
are
in
the
library,
and
i
know
that
this
board
does
very
carefully
select
textbooks.
it
does
not,
has
not
in
the
past
selected
library
books.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
would
say
7,000,
give
or
take
1,000.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
the
chelsey
case
to
which
i
just
referred
to,
oddly
enough,
the
justice
who
restored
the
poem
to
the
shelves
did
state
that
a
district
or
a
school
district
had
the
power
to
decide
there
is
no
library
whatsoever.
in
new
york
state--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--in
new
york
state,
of
course,
we
must
have
a
library.
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
it
requires
at
least
1,000
volumes
in
each
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
school
libraries.
we
would
not
have
that
power
in
new
york.
nor
would
we
assert
it
if
we
did
have
it.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
have
not
seen
it
applied
in
book
banning
cases,
of
which
there
are
now
a
number.
motivation
may
have
some
bearing.
certainly
if
the
motivation
again
is
to
ban
a
theory
or
doctrine
of
thought,
the
motivation
is
to
assert
a
rigid
and
exclusive
indoctrination
with
regard
to
all
areas
of
thought.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
do
not
know
of
anything
supporting
that
proposition.
i
also
would
add
that
it
is
my
understanding
or
my
experience
that
motivation
is
one
of
the
most
terribly
difficult
things
to
establish
in
law,
and
if
all
that
is
needed
to
compel
a
full-blown
trial
is
merely
an
allegation
of
impure
motivation,
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
be
inundated
with
just
the
very
type
of
situation
that
i
think
the
doctrine
of
judicial
restraint
and
local
control
requires
that
we
make
every
attempt
to
avoid,
especially
in
the
school
environment.
i
think
justice
newman...
judge
newman's
concurring
opinion
in
the
plurality
is
one
that
frightened
me
greatly,
both
with
respect
to
the
motivation
situation
and
his
suggestion
that
the
trial
court
should
look
prospectively
to
see
whether
possibly
there
had
been
a
suppression
of
ideas
as
a
result
of
the
action,
even
though
apparently
there
was
no
intent
to
suppress.
that
was
a
frightening
concept,
and
i
might
remind
the
court,
with
limited
time,
that
there
absolutely
is
no
attempt
to
suppress
ideas,
and
i
am
not
making
that
statement
from
my
own
personal
knowledge.
i
am
making
that
statement
from
the
record.
there
was
a
9-g
statement
executed
by
the
parties
under
the
local
rule
in
the
second
circuit
that
states,
for
all
practical
purposes,
that
there
is
no
attempt
to
suppress
records.
the
9-g
statement
said--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--yes,
i
would.
there
are
four
9-g
statements
in
the
appendix,
justice
o'connor.
the
latter,
plaintiffs'
9-g
statement
is
at
page
142
of
the
appendix,
and
the
statement
to
which
i
am
referring
is
that,
quote,
and
it
is
paragraph
12,
"no
teacher
has
been
instructed
not
to
discuss
the
books
which
were
removed
or
to
refrain
from
discussion
or
comment
upon
the
ideas
and
positions
they
represent.
"
and
yet
starting
with
subsequent,
immediately
subsequent
to
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court,
all
i
have
been
seeing
in
the
briefs
opposing
my
position
is
that
we
have
suppressed
ideas
and
we
have
suppressed
points
of
view.
that
was
not
even
alleged
in
the
complaint,
and
it
has
been
agreed,
and
also
in
the
other
plaintiffs'
9-g
statement...
it
was
worded
somewhat
differently...
and
that
is
at
page
128
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
has
been
no
suppression
of
ideas,
and
the
record
supports
that.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
this
is
what
i
certainly
hope
is
not
the
federal
court's
job--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--to
read
these
volumes,
and
i
think
it
is
sad
that
judge
mansfield--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--i
think
a
federal
judge
is
to
attempt
to
ascertain
under
the
epperson
doctrine
whether
there
has
been
a
sharp
and
direct
conflict
with
constitutional
values
alleged.
i
think
he
must
ascertain
from
the
face
of
the
documents
before
the
court
whether
there
has
been
a
rigid
and
exclusive
attempt
at
indoctrination,
an
allegation
of
that,
or
whether
there
has
been
an
allegation
of
a
comprehensive
plan
to
ban
the
teaching
of
an
ideology
or
a
theory
or
a
doctrine,
but
not
a
mere
allegation
that
a
board
used
its
own
moral,
political,
and
social
values.
this
is
their
role,
and
if
this
court
finds
that
a
full-blown
trial
is
required
as
a
result--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--i
certainly
think
that
would
be
insufficient,
mr.
justice--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--this
becomes
an
attempt
at
banning
an
idea,
the
idea
that
blacks
are
fine
people,
and
you
could
have
a
difficulty
there,
but
you
must
also
remember
that
we
are...
well,
we
are
not
only
dealing
with
the
possibility
of
religion
or
the
possibility
of
creed,
or
with
profanity.
we
are
dealing
with
books
that
might
involve
violence.
we
are
dealing
with
something
such
as
a
modest
proposal,
which
this
board,
i
feel,
whether
its
wisdom...
whether
it
was
wise
or
not,
and
that
is
not
for
this
court
to
address,
the
wisdom
of
their
actions,
was
in
fact--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--this
board
did
submit
the
issue
to
a
committee
for
recommendation
and--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--no,
they
did
not
almost
entirely
ignore,
but
again,
it
is
in
the
record,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
they
restored
two
of
them.
the
committee
was
split
seriously,
and
they
did
give
that
committee
certain
guidelines.
those
guidelines
were
guidelines--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--well,
the
guidelines
were
not--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--the
guidelines
were
not
extensive
guidelines,
because
the
state
of
new
york
did
not
even
have
guidelines
at
that
time.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
precisely
what
guidelines
the
board
followed.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
somewhat
similar
to
judge
mansfield.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
it
was
in
fact,
he
found
that
they
may
have
been
unwise,
but
in
effect
he
used
voltaire's--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
the
judge
writing
the
plurality
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
should
be
an
investigation
into
the
suppression
of
ideas,
judge
newman
concurring.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
and
judge
mansfield
in
a
very
vigorous:
dissent
found
that
the
board
acted
admirably
and
responsibly.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
no,
he
did
not.
he
had
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
before
him,
to
which
i
appended
every
document
that
i
could
find
that
i
thought
relevant.
the
respondents
here
chose
not
to
oppose
any
of
the
affidavit
materials
or
any
of
the
evidentiary
materials,
and
that
is
what
the
record
is
before
the
court--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--oh,
absolutely.
there
hasn't
been
any
comment
about
political
motivation
or--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--until
then.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
board
had
regulations,
which
the
circuit
court
seems
to
feel
they
should
have
had,
because
none
were
required.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
the
standards,
and
i
think
this
is
an
assumption,
because
it
is
not
contained
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
marshall,
are
the
same
that
pertain
to
the
committee
that
they
appointed,
because
this
was
from
their
negotiations
contract,
and
applied
to
a
situation
where
a
parent
objected.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
at
that
time,
six
years
ago,
justice
marshall,
this
was
not
a
common
occurrence.
i
certainly,
once
this
case
is
completed,
am
going
to
recommend
that
guidelines
be
adopted.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
because
you
are
dealing,
justice
marshall,
with
so
many
facets.
you
are
dealing
with
such
imponderables
as
morals,
social
values,
ethics,
that
to
standardize
them,
to
regulate
is
going
to
be
an
unmanageable
task.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
you
can
follow
the
rule
of
minimal
rationality
which
one
writer
has
suggested,
or
the
rule
of
rationality,
and
an
examination
of
the
record
will
show
this
board
to
have
been
rational.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
there...
your
honor
is
in
error,
but
only
with
regard
to
the
number
of
times.
this
may
be
the
case.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
but
they
do
not
have
to
put
their
condemnation,
their
stamp
of
approval
upon
it,
nor
would
it
be
permitted
in
the
classroom,
and
a
disciplinary
action
against
these
students
would
be
constitutionally
permissible
for
the
use
of
that
type
of
language.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
say
that
there
is
some
imprimatur.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
good
and
bad
with
regard
to
style,
with
regard
to
content,
but
not
with
regard--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
with
regard
to
profanity
and
indecency,
mr.
justice.
i
am
reserving
time--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
would
think
that
would
be
permissible,
if
there
was
no
attempt
to
favor
one
religion
over
another.
certainly
i
feel
that
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
that...
well,
that
is
what
i
stated.
that
is
the
exception
that
i
made.
if
there
is
no
indication
of
an
attempt
to
establish
a
religion,
in
other
words,
to
favor
one
over
another,
to
inculcate
in
a
particular
religion.
that
would
make
it
a
different
situation.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
lay
to
rest
the
allegations
of
political
motivation.
i
would
like
to
do
it
by
stating
that
i
have
read
all
of
the
books
involved
very
recently.
i
have
read
the
one
book
that
is
allegedly
to
have
referred
to
malcolm
x.
that
was
a
different
edition.
the
board
banned
a
book
that
had
absolutely
no
reference
to
malcolm
x.
that
was
the
book
that
contained
a
modest
proposal.
with
regard
to
a
hero
ain't
nothing
but
a
sandwich,
not--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
their
feeling
is
that
it
was--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
they
felt
it
was
in
bad
taste.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
if
they
felt
that
that
bad
taste
was
related
to
educational
suitability,
i
would
think
they
would
have
that
right,
as
long
as
they
are
not--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--they
would
be
very
foolish,
and
if
that
were
the
sole...
if
that
were
the
sole--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--if
that
were
the
sole
reason--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--if
that
were
the
sole
reason,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i...
i
still
question
whether
that
would--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--i
realize
that.
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
i
think
it
would,
because
it
does
not
address
a
doctrine
of
thought,
an
ideology
or
favor
a
political
party
or
religion,
and
so
forth.
i
want
also
to
add
that
not
only
did
the
other
book,
a
hero
ain't
nothing
but
a
sandwich,
refer
to
george
washington
in
what
the
board
felt
was
disparaging
terms,
it
was
laced
with
obscenities.
the
political
excerpts
that
mr.
levine
has
said--
mr.
george
w.
lipp,
jr.
--well,
the
political
motivation
that
mr.
levine
is
saying
"they"
had
was
motivation
of
the
randolph
new
york
state
school
district
that
had
a
list
of
excerpts
with
these
comments,
their
own
comments,
sitting
on
a
table
at
this
conference
that
the
board
went
to
at
the
request
of
a
regent
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
want
to
remind
the
court
that
there
are
substantial
limitations
upon
the
requirement
for
content
neutrality,
among
which
are
the
young
against
american
mini-theaters
case,
where
mr.
justice
stevens
wrote
the
majority
decision.
we
have,
of
course,
the
fact
that
juveniles
do
not
have
rights
equal
with
adults.
you
have
many,
many
areas
where
there
are
erosions
upon
this
so-called
absolute
right
that
it
appears
that
mr.
levine
is
claiming.
it
is
not
absolute,
especially
in
the
area
of
public
education.
thank
you.
