unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
does
it
make
any
difference
what
is
in
the
books?
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
barred
the
st.
james
version
of
the
new
testament,
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
the
declaration
of
independence?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lipp,
perhaps
i
should
ask
your
opposition
this
one,
but
are
any
of
these
named
plaintiffs
still
in
school?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask,
just
on
the
facts,
did
the
action
taken
just
remove
the
books
from
the
library,
or
did
it
forbid
their
use
in
class,
or
as
outside
reading?
suppose
some
of
these
books
were
assigned
as
outside
reading,
and
the
children
were
told,
you
can
get
it
in
the
public
library?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
okay.
unknown
speaker
what
were
the
ages
of
the
five
plaintiffs
at
the
time
the
books
were
removed?
unknown
speaker
and
the
13
and
14
were
junior
high
school
students?
unknown
speaker
did
the
same
library
serve
both
junior
and
senior
high
schools?
unknown
speaker
there
were
separate
libraries?
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
these
books
were
in
the
senior
high
school
library?
unknown
speaker
would
the
record
show?
unknown
speaker
how
are
the
members
of
the
school
board...
how
do
they
acquire
their
positions
as
members?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
had
a
book,
counsel,
that
had
been
the
subject
of
criminal
proceedings,
and
conviction
of
someone
in
connection
with
that
book
had
been
sustained,
a
criminal
conviction.
would
you
say
that
that
book
comes
under
this
broad
authority
you
suggest?
unknown
speaker
even
though--
unknown
speaker
--the
publisher
has
been...
even
though
it
has
been
found
to
be
criminally
pornographic,
obscene?
unknown
speaker
the
power
to
put
it
in
or
to
take
it
out,
which?
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
lipp,
would
your
view
be
that
at
some
point
a
particular
decision
by
a
board
which,
if
it
were
made
to
remove
from
student
exposure
all
references
in
the
library
to
a
particular
ideology,
would
be
subject
to
examination
in
the
federal
courts?
is
there
some
place
where
you
would
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
articulate
those,
then,
from
your
point
of
view?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say,
mr.
lipp,
that
under...
just
to
get
an
example.
i
was
interested
in
the
same
question
justice
o'connor
asked.
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remove
all
books
in
the
library
that
contained
any
disparaging
remarks
about
blacks
or
jews?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
be
any
review--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
they
just
removed
one
book.
would
there
be
ever
any
federal
review
of
removal
of
one
book?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
one
book
you
removed
is
removed
because
it
has
disparaging
remarks
about
jews
and
blacks
in
it.
unknown
speaker
would
you
speak
up,
please,
sir?
it
is
very
hard
to
hear
you
when
you
are
away
from
the
microphone.
unknown
speaker
please
stay
near
the
center
of
the
two
microphones.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is,
you
started
your
argument
by
quoting
from
judge
mansfield--
unknown
speaker
--who
pointed
out
that
all
the
books
but
one
were
either
vulgar
or
contained
disparaging
remarks
about
blacks,
jews,
or
christ,
and
i
thought,
well,
let's
just...
it
is
a
summary
judgment
case.
let's
just
concentrate
on
one
book
that
meets
that
standard.
is
there
any
federal
review
of
the
board's
decision
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
ever
be
any
federal
basis
for
reviewing
a
board's
decision
to
remove
one
book
on
the
ground
that
judge
mansfield
stated,
and
if
so,
what
would
the
federal
standard
of
review
be?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
judge
mansfield
said
there
were...
he
didn't
rely
on
vulgarity
for
one
of
the
books.
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
really
trying
to
find
out
is,
what
is
the
standard
that
you
ask
the
court
to
adopt
in
deciding
whether
there
is
federal
review
of
this
kind
of
decision?
unknown
speaker
did
i
hear
you
to
say
political
values?
if
the
board
chose
to
remove
books
containing
favorable
references
to
republicans
because
it
was
a
good
democratic
board,
we
should
not
let
that
go
on
to
be
examined?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lipp,
how
are
books
normally
selected
for
the
library
in
this
school
district?
unknown
speaker
but
normally
the
school
board
would
not
have
the
time
or
the
opportunity
to
review
every
book
that
goes
into
the
library.
unknown
speaker
right.
that
is
a
different
matter.
unknown
speaker
that
is
required
by
law.
unknown
speaker
how
many
books
are
in
this
library?
unknown
speaker
would
this
board
have
authority
to
simply
say,
we
will
have
no
library
at
all
in
the
school,
just
abolish
the
library?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
to
the
new
york
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lipp,
getting
back
to
the
standard
which
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
impose
on
the
board
in
a
situation
like
this,
i
find
in
judge
newman's
concurring
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
some
suggestion
that
precisely
the
same
objective
acts
on
the
part
of
the
board
could
be
permissible
or
impermissible
depending
on
the
motive
with
which
the
board
did
them,
and
it
struck
me
that
test
certainly
has
been
applied
in
discrimination
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
haven't
seen
it
applied
in
first
amendment
cases
before.
unknown
speaker
what
position
do
you
take
on
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
find
any
authority
supporting
the
proposition
that
something
done
with
a
good
motive
is
all
right
but
something
done
with
a
bad
motive
is
not
all
right,
if
it
is
precisely
the
same
thing
that
is
done,
in
our
first
amendment
cases.
unknown
speaker
would
you
refer
us
to
a
page
in
a
book?
unknown
speaker
i
must
say,
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist,
you
indicate
motive
is
entirely
irrelevant.
is
that
your
view?
the
motive
for
the
removal?
the
federal
judge's
job
is
to
go
ahead
and
read
the
books
and
either
agree
or
disagree?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
do
i.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
a
federal
judge
to
do
when
a
complaint
of
this
kind
is
made?
what
are
the
issues
that
have
to
be
faced?
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
complaint
had
been
written
this
way,
and
said,
well,
we
allege
that
the
board
removed
a
book
that
had
some
disparaging
comments
about
blacks
in
it
and
was
otherwise
a
very
good
book,
and
we
think
we
have
a
right
to
have
that
book
in
the
library.
that
would
be
insufficient,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
supposing
it
said,
the
board
removed
all
books
which
contained
any
criticism
of
black
people
of
any
kind.
would
that
be
analogous?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
board
given
us
any...
did
the
board
act
on
the
basis
of
any
standards
or
any
indication
of
just
what
rules
it
thought
it
was
applying?
unknown
speaker
but
then
they
almost
entirely
ignored
the
committee's
recommendation.
unknown
speaker
well,
pretty
nearly.
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
follow
any
guidelines?
that
is
my
question.
they
gave
the
committee
an
assignment.
the
committee
came
back.
and
then
they
just
went
ahead
and--
unknown
speaker
--they
could
have
done
precisely
the
same
thing
without
the
committee.
unknown
speaker
no,
my
question
is,
did
the
board
act
on
the
basis
of
any
guidelines?
they
gave
guidelines
to
the
committee,
which
presumably
the
committee
followed,
but
then
they
did
not
follow
the
committee.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
we
talk
about
what
the
district
court
thought,
found,
what
basis
they...
didn't
the
district
court
say
that
the
books
were
banned
because
they
contained
vulgarity?
unknown
speaker
and
wasn't
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--wasn't
that
his
view
of
the
record
as
to
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
standard
they
used
for
banning
these
books?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
that
was
the
standard
he
found
they
applied.
unknown
speaker
that
they
banned
vulgar
books.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
he
found?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
court
of
appeals
differ
with
that,
say
that,
well,
there
should
be
a
trial
because
we
don't
agree
with
the
district
judge
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
is
just
differing
with
the
district
judge.
unknown
speaker
with
regard
to
the
district
judge,
did
the
district
judge
hear
any
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
so
he
thought
it
was
undisputed
that
they
ban
books
on
the...
for
vulgarity.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district...
the
court
of
appeals
thought
there
should
be
a
trial
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
point
to
any
standard
that
the
school
board
had?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
regulations.
i
said
standards.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
normal
to
have
standards
to
govern?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
normal
to
say
that
we
took
this
action
because
of
such
and
such
a
violation
of
such
and
such
a
standard?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
regulate
without
standards?
unknown
speaker
it
couldn't
be
just
vulgarity,
because
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
once
or
twice
during
a
year
there
is
some
vulgarity
in
the
schoolyard
there.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
when
a
school
board
puts
a
book
in
its
library,
it
puts
a
stamp
of
approval
on
that
book?
unknown
speaker
it
wants
the
students
to
read
everything
they
can,
good
and
bad?
unknown
speaker
or
good
and
bad
with
regard
to
the
standards
which,
you
don't
have.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lipp?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
a
school
board
could
remove
a
book
from
the
library
solely
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
offensive
to
a
particular
religion?
unknown
speaker
within
the
establishment
clause?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
to
you
in
that
connection
the
question
i
put
to
your
friend.
suppose
that
a
particular
look
is
involved
which
has
already
been
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
criminal
law
as
obscene,
pornographic.
could
that
be
eliminated
from
the
library?
unknown
speaker
why
is
the
judgment
of
the
jury
in
that
case
determinative
other
than
theoretically
it
expresses
the
community's
standard?
is
that
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
if
a
school...
under
new
york
law,
if
a
school
board
took
on
the
responsibility
which
it
has
been
suggested
they
haven't
the
time
they
do
it,
but
suppose
they
did
take
the
responsibility
and
said,
here
are
2,000
books
that
should
be
in
the
library,
and
no
books
are
to
be
added
except
if
they
are
cleared
with
the
school
board.
could
they
lawfully
do
that
under
new
york
law?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
were
agreed
that
the
school
board
decided
to
take
off
the
shelves
all
books
that
they
thought
were
vulgar,
and
that
there
is
an
agreement
that,
yes,
these
books
are
vulgar
by
anybody's
standards.
your
position
is,
i
take
it,
that
those
books
could
not
be
removed
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
is
short
of
obscenity,
but
let's
just
say
that
it
is
full
of
words
that
most
people
would
think
are
vulgar
words.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
that
some
people
wouldn't
think
they
are
vulgar,
but
most
people
would,
but
let's
just...
isn't
your
position,
though,
that
just
vulgarity
is
not
subject
to
being
banned
by
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
will
put
it
to
you
this
way.
your
position
is
that
none
of
these
books
that
are
involved
here
could
have
been
removed
for
"vulgarity".
unknown
speaker
could
you
articulate
the
theory
of
your
first
amendment
claim?
i
take
it
it
is
the
students'
either
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
the
press,
which
is
the
language
used
by
the
first
amendment,
which
is
being
infringed.
now,
could
you
explain
how
that
infringes
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
that
was
the
next
question,
when
you
said
yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you.
that's
all
right.
unknown
speaker
there
are
no
teachers
parties
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
case
from
this
court
do
you
think
comes
closest
to
supporting
your
position
that
the
students
are
denied
their
first
amendment
rights
if
books
are
taken
off
the
shelf
of
a
school
library
by
the
school
board?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this...
this
is
quite
different
from
tinker,
isn't
it--
unknown
speaker
--where
a
form
of
expression
was
expressly
prohibited?
i
don't
understand
any
expression
on
the
parts
of
the
students
has
been
prohibited
here.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
think
that
is
true.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
steven
pico
can
go
to
any
number
of
stores
on
long
island
and
get
the
books
he
wants.
unknown
speaker
the
state
of
new
york
hasn't
prevented
him
from
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
theory
would
certainly
cover...
mean,
then,
that
a
school
board,
if
it
participated,
or
even
teachers,
whoever
is
choosing
the
books
that
the
school
buys
may
not
decide
not
to
buy
books
because
they
are
vulgar.
you
must
also
say
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
also
the
cast
the
district
court
put
it
in.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
my
question
about
acquisition
of
books?
unknown
speaker
your
theory
would
cover
that,
too.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say,
yes,
you
would
say
that
the
board
could
not
have
decided
constitutionally
to
ban
any
one
of
these
books
that
is
involved
here,
or
decide
not
to
buy
any
one
of
these
books.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
particular
book
in
a
particular
place?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levine,
does
your
theory
apply
to
textbooks
as
well
as
books
in
the
library?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
under
state
law,
i
suppose
a
state
board
of
education
gives
the
local
boards
the
opportunity
to
select
books
within
a
group.
or
what
is
the
procedure?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
now
about
textbooks.
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
pupil
objected
to
a
textbook
or
objected
to
one
not
being
used
as
a
textbook,
i
understand
your
theory
would
still
be
applicable.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
new
york
law
clearly
does.
unknown
speaker
and
what--
unknown
speaker
--i
beg
your
pardon.
unknown
speaker
even...
a
school
board
has
no
right
to
determine
which
books
shall
be
used
in
the
various
classes,
if
students
object?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
did
arise,
would
your
theory
apply
to
it?
unknown
speaker
would
it
apply
to
what
teachers
teach
in
the
classroom?
suppose
you
had
a
teacher
who
had
the
same
view
about
that
book
that
you
have
just
described,
and
refused
to
teach
it.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
conflict
between
pupils'
rights
and
teachers'
rights?
and
who
would
resolve
that?
unknown
speaker
teachers
often
prepare
their
own
outlines.
unknown
speaker
and
use
those
primarily
rather
than
the
approved
textbooks.
unknown
speaker
if
a
pupil
disagrees
with
the
outline
used
by
the
teacher,
i
take
it
she
would
have
standing
or
he
would
have
standing.
unknown
speaker
i
know
this
case
doesn't,
but
i
am
testing--
unknown
speaker
--the
reach
of
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
yes.
it
seems
to
me--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
have
any
limiting
principle?
how
far
does
your
theory...
or
where
does
it
end?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levine,
what
are
those
limits?
that
is
what
justice
powell
and
i
would
both
like
to
know.
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
are
some
limits.
what
are
the
limits?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
assume
you
would
say
they
can
remove
obscene
books
from
the
library,
if
they
are
illegal.
i
think
you
answered
that.
but
are
there
any
other
books
that
they
may
remove
from
the
library?
i
thought
you
indicated
pervasively
vulgar
ones,
you
thought.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
already
conceded
that
the
school
board
could
say,
here
are
2,000
books,
which
would
exclude
every
book
that
they
thought
was
borderline
pornographic,
obscene,
or
vulgar.
i
understood
you
to
say
they
could--
unknown
speaker
--no,
you...
then
we've
got
to
clear
it
up.
i
thought
you,
in
response
to
my
earlier
question,
had
said,
if
the
school
board
put
2,000
books
that
they
wanted
in
the
library,
and
it
excluded
all
the
books
that
are
in
question
here,
that
they
could
do
that.
now
you
say
they
can't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
who
is
going
to
pick--
unknown
speaker
--who
is
going
to
pick
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
standard
must
the
librarian
use
in
picking
these
books?
unknown
speaker
who
prepares
the
rating
journals?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
mentioned
the
pacifica
foundation
case.
do
you
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
levine,
supposing
that
these
nine
books
had
been
acquired
by
the
school
district,
say,
in
1970
or
1971
as
a
representative
collection
of
the
kind
of
protest
literature
of
the
sixties.
i
am
not
sure
they
would
all
fit
in
that
category--
unknown
speaker
--but
supposing
they
would,
and
they
had
been
kept
there
for
ten
years,
and
then
there
was
a
series
of
books
published
about
the
history
of
early
new
york,
and
there
was
a
shelf
space
problem,
and
the
school
board
decided
to
get
rid
of
this
collection
of
the
sixties
because
it
was
somewhat
passe,
and
to
expose
the
students
to
the
history
of
early
new
york,
since
they
couldn't
do
both.
now,
there,
there
is
no
problem
of
motivation
at
all,
but
you
are
getting
rid
of
precisely
the
same
books.
unknown
speaker
do
you
get
a
different
result?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
are
saying
the
reasons
i
gave
you
in
the
hypothetical
are
not
permissible?
unknown
speaker
they
are
permissible.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
lipp.
if
the
precise
same
objective
acts
depend
for
their
constitutional
validity
on
the
motivation
of
the
people
who
perform
the
acts,
in
one
case
they
are
bad
and
in
the
other
case
they
are
good,
what
support
do
you
find
in
our
first
amendment
cases
for
the
result
depending
on
motivation?
can
you
name
one
case?
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
two
different
acts,
really.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
then
you
would
always...
anybody
who
could
draft
a
complaint
halfway
decently
could
always
get
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean,
if
it
is
motivation
that
is
on
the
front
burner,
it
is
a...
you
are
always
going
to
survive
a
summary
judgment
motion.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
going
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
am
just
suggesting
that
if
motivation
is
the
pivotal
factor,
you
are
going
to
get
to
trial
a
lot
more
often
than
if
it
were
some
objective
matter.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levine,
do
you
think
that
elementary
and
high
school
students
have
first
amendment
rights
which
are
the
same
as
those
of
adults?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
not
then
the
first
amendment
rights
of
elementary
and
high
school
students
somewhat
different,
and
don't
we
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--look
to
that
pretty
closely?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
originally
some
of
the
plaintiffs
came
from
seventh
or
eighth
grade,
which
is
not
high
school.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wasn't
post-litigation
if
the
district
judge
thought
that
that
is
what
the
school
board
turned
its
actions
on.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
very
post-litigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
then
in
your...
in
litigation
that
you
would
contemplate
the
federal
court
would
have
to
decide,
well,
why
were
these
books
really
taken
off
the
shelves,
and
if
they
found
that,
well,
they
were
taken
off
because
the
school
board
thought
they
were
vulgar,
then
you
would
have
to
decide,
the
federal
court
would
have
to
say,
well,
were
they
vulgar
enough
to
warrant
taking
them
off
the
shelf?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that...
that
is
what
you
would
contemplate?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
saying
you
are
wrong.
i
just
want
to
know
what
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
that
book
then
is
vulgar
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
are
saying,
or
let's
put
it
this
way.
is
what
you
are
saying
that
is
between
the
federal
judge
and
the
elected
school
board,
the
latter
prevails
in
the
judgment
of
this
book?
unknown
speaker
but
the
thing
you
haven't
told
us
as
far
as...
i
have
been
listening
rather
carefully
to
your
argument.
i
don't
really
know
what
your
standard
is.
why
under
your
view,
if
the
school
board
had
appointed
a
committee,
as
they
did
here,
and
they
said,
find
out
if
there
is
too
much...
read
the
book
as
a
whole
and
consider
its
literary
value,
see
if
it
has
any
relevance
to
course
material,
and
they
had
two
or
three
other
guidelines
in
there.
supposing
the
committee
had
come
back,
as
they
did,
and
they
maybe
wrote
a
full
report
on
each
book,
and
then
the
committee
followed
the
recommendations,
as
they
did
not
here,
and
removed
three
books
and
kept
five,
or
six,
or
whatever
the
number
is.
you
would
say
that
was
still
unconstitutional.
is
that
correct?
and
say
that
you
can't
dispute
their
judgment.
each
one,
any
impartial
observer,
a
teacher,
a
book
expert
would
agree
that
they
had
faithfully
followed
the
standards.
unknown
speaker
what
constitutional
right
of
whom
has
been
violated?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
have
said
to
us
every
book
here
has
a...
that
is
not
what
you
said
earlier
in
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
said
earlier
that
your
clients
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
all
the
books
retained,
even
those
that
were
unanimously
rejected
by
the
committee
and
by
the
board.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
saying
to
you,
supposing
they
gave
the
reasons
that
the
committee
followed
the
standards
and
applied
those
standards.
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
have
a
constitutional
objection
to
what
they
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
now
claim
a
constitutional
right
to
have
all
the
books
restored
to
the
shelves.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
read
the
whole
books,
according
to
the
affidavits.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
as
true?
you
didn't
file
any
countervailing
affidavits.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
mean
the
person
read
only
the
isolated
theme.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levine,
let
me
pursue
the
subject
you
were
discussing
with
justice
stevens.
i
have
page
a-97,
the
district
court's
opinion,
a-97,
top
of
the
page,
sort
of
the
concluding
statement
by
the
district
judge.
what
he
says
is,
the
pleadings,
affidavits,
and
so
forth
demonstrate
that
the
nine
books,
and
i
am
omitting
a
word
or
two,
were
removed
because
they
were
irrelevant,
vulgar,
immoral,
and
in
bad
taste,
making
them
educationally
unsuitable
for
the
district's
junior
and
senior
high
school
students.
now,
i
understand,
of
course,
that
you
don't
agree
that
they
were
educationally
unsuitable.
my
question
is,
is
not
it
the
primary
function
of
a
school
board
to
determine
what
is
educationally
suitable,
and
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
answer
that
in
the
negative.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
federal
courts
are
better
qualified
to
answer
that
question
that
school
boards?
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
think
we
are,
but
i
know
we
aren't.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
we
do
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
we
have
two
judges
one
way
and
two
the
other,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
but
somebody
has
to
make
a
decision
as
to
what
is
educationally
suitable.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
page
a-107,
the
court
made
an
even
narrower...
drew
an
even
narrower
inference
from
the
facts.
"the
board
has
restricted
access
only
to
certain
books
which
the
board
believed
to
be,
in
essence,
vulgar.
"
that
was
his
assessment
of
what
the
board
did.
that
is
judge
pratt's
assessment.
that's
correct.
i...
like
judge--
--i
know
you
disagree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
say
all
of
these
books
should
go
back
on
the
shelves.
unknown
speaker
on
that
book,
mr....
that
book,
did
you
refer...
that
one
was
not
vulgar.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
vulgarity
at
all
in
that
book?
unknown
speaker
so
the
banning
of
that
book
cannot
be
justified
on
vulgarity
grounds.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
ground
for
banning
it?
just
bad
taste?
unknown
speaker
now,
supposing
they
took...
would
it
be
permissible
for
them
to
take
every
book
out
of
the
library
they
thought
was
in
bad
taste?
what
does
bad
taste
mean?
unknown
speaker
could
they
take
every
book
out
of
the
library
that
contained
the
word
"ain't"?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judge
here
says
they
were
foolish.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
sole
reason.
they
don't
want
the
children
to
form
the
bad
habit
of
using
the
word
"ain't".
i
was
taught
that
was
a
vulgar
word.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
really
want...
this
is
a
serious
question.
i
am
not
playing
games.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
sufficient
reason
to
be
a
total
answer
to
a
constitutional
objection?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
barred
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
constitution,
which
also
recognize
slavery?
