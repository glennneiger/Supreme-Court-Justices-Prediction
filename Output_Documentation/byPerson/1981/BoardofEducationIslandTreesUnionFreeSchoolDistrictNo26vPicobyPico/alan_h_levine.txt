mr.
alan
h.
levine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
help
to
focus
on
where
the
parties
disagree
by
first
saying
a
few
things
about
which
we
do
agree.
schools,
of
course,
do
transmit
values.
local
school
boards
may,
of
course,
give
particular
regard
for
the
values
of
the
local
community
that
they
serve.
what
we
say
here
is
that
they
may
not
ignore
their
obligation
to
observe
and
respect
a
diversity
of
values.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
without
question,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
the
judgment
of
a
jury
is,
first
of
all,
a
judgment
that
a
book
has
fit
into
a
very
narrow
exception
to
first
amendment
protection,
the
obscenity
standard.
the
exception
to
first
amendent
protection
asserted
by
the
defendants
here
is
a
very
broad
one.
they
assert
the
power
to
ban
books
that
give
offense.
that
doesn't
resemble
the
obscenity
standard
at
all.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
believe
under
new
york
law,
and
certainly
there
would
be
no
constitutional
exception
to
that
process.
this
isn't
a
case
about
the
constitutional
right
of
a
particular
group
of
people
to
make
that
decision.
new
york
law
gives
the
ultimate
authority
to
the
school
boards,
and
if
they
had
the
time
and
the
inclination,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
the
problem
i
have
with
your
question,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is
vulgar
by
everybody's
standard.
now,
i
assume
you
mean
some
standard
short
of
obscenity,
since
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--well--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--just
random
instances
of
vulgarity
in
books
such
as
these
is
not
a
constitutional
basis
for
permanently
proscribing
a
book
from
a
school
district.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
absolutely.
and
let
me
make--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
assume
you
are
asking
a
different
question
from
justice
white's,
and
that
is
simply
what
is
the
first
amendment
right
at
stake
here.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
right
has
been
described
in
some
courts
and
in
some
legal
commentators
as
the
right
to
receive
information.
we
have
not
asserted
that
right.
we
think
the
right
to
read
a
book
is
so
clearly
inherent
in
first
amendment
analysis
that
even
though
most
book
cases
have
been
brought
by
book
sellers,
or
book
publishers,
surely
if
the
state
deprived
the
citizenry
of
reading
a
book,
the
citizenry
would
have
a
right...
a
first
amendment
right
to
protest
that
action.
within
the
school
context,
of
course,
the
court
has
historically
talked
about
the
right
of
academic
freedom,
and
even
though
those
cases
arise
often
with
teachers,
what
the
interest
is
that
is
underlying
those
academic
freedom
cases
is
an
interest
that
students
be
exposed
to
diverse
ideas,
and
it
is
that
diversity,
that
threat
of
orthodoxy
which
is
really
at
issue
here.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
there
are
no
teachers
who
are
parties
to
this
case.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
think
no
case...
this
is
the
first
time,
of
course,
the
issue
is
before
the
court.
the
lower
courts
have
gone
off
in
several
different
directions.
in
this
case,
the
analysis
proceeds,
we
think,
from
a
line
of
cases
from
meyer
versus
nebraska
through
west
virginia
versus
barnette,
keyishian
versus
board
of
regents,
and
tinker,
all
of
which
are
concerned
about
the
limits
of
a
school
board's
power
to
indoctrinate.
they
recognize
that
that
is
a
legitimate
concern.
we
concede
that
school
boards
may
well
give
special
regard
to
the
values
of
a
local
community,
but
there
are
limits
on
that
process.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
absolutely.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
but
i...
i
don't
think
the
court,
but
for
the
special
circumstance
of
this
taking
place
in
a
school
community,
would
have
any
question
of
steven
pico's
right
to
complain
about
the
state
prohibiting
a
book
store
from
selling
books
to
certain
people.
it
is
a--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--it
is
a
right
to
receive
information,
though
i
don't
think
the
analysis
was
just
created
with
virginia
board
of
pharmacies.
i
think
it
is
historically
assumed
that
the
right
to
read
a
book
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is
possible.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it's
possible,
but
an
agency
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
said
that
he
cannot
have
access
to
that
book
in
that
school.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
in
response
to
your
questions,
i
was
going
to
get
back
to
vulgarity,
because
it
is
the
issue
that
the
court
has
focused
on,
and
it
is
the
cast
in
which
the
defendants
prefer
to
put
the
case.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
yes,
but
not
the
circuit
court.
it
is
true
it
is
the--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--it
is
the
focus
of
judge
mansfield's
dissent,
but
it
is
important
to
understand
a
couple
of
things,
and
why
judge
newman
thought
a
trial--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
don't
think--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
do
not
think
that
if
a
school
board
said,
we
are
not
going
to
buy
the
fixer,
a
pulitzer
prize
winner,
national
book
award
winner,
because
it
contains,
according
to
this
record,
eight
dirty
words
out
of
200
some
odd
pages,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
constitutionally
defensible
decision.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
these
books.
that's
correct.
there
may
be...
there
may
be
cases
out
there
that
are
difficult
in
which
the
books
are
pervasively
vulgar.
that
is
not
these
books,
however.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
and
that
is
not
the
issue
in
the
case,
but
here
we
go
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
of
motivation
before.
when
can
a
book
be
removed?
when
can
it
be
substituted
for
another
book?
understand
here
these
books
were
not
removed
because
any
other
book
was
being
substituted
for
them.
they
got
the
names
of
these
books
from
a
list
that
they
received
at
a
conference.
they
don't
know
who
authored
the
list.
they
learned
nothing
about
them
except
the
exteriors,
and
then
they
removed
them,
but
surely,
at
least
for
a
book
that
is
in
the
curriculum,
and
only
one
of
these
was,
the
fixer,
if
they
make
the
judgment,
however
quixotic,
that
silas
marner
is
of
better
use
in
the
english
curriculum
than
the
fixer,
they
have
absolutely
no
constitutional
compulsion
not
to
replace
that
book.
no
constitutional
principle
interferes
with
that.
however,
if
they
remove
the
book
solely
because
it
contains
a
passage
that
offends
a
particular
group
in
the
community,
then
the
constitution,
then
the
first
amendment
is
concerned.
now,
what
we
have
here
about
some
of
these
books
are
explicitly
political
comments.
cleaver's
soul
on
ice,
the
excerpts
contain
one
passage
of
vulgarity
out
of
the
entire
book.
but
what
else
do
the
excerpts
tell
us?
that
he
is
a
black
panther
and
considered
a
traitor
to
his
country.
that
is
part
of
the
reason
that
book
was
banned.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
if
you
mean
curricular
books?
mr.
alan
h.
levine
in
theory,
yes,
though
the
process
would
normally
be
very
different,
and
therefore
generally
immune
to
constitutional
scrutiny,
because
the
process
by
which
one
book
is
chosen
over
another
one
will
generally
appear
to
be
neutral.
there
will
not
be
suspect
reasons.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--as
far
as
i
know,
school
districts
are
free
to
order
whatever
textbooks
they
want.
i
don't
know
if
the
procedure--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--that's
right.
you
are
not
asking
me
if
new
york
law
gives
him
any
right.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
then.
no,
i
don't
think
a
student
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
read
a
book.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
what--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--our
theory
is
simply
that
school
boards
don't
have
the
power
to
deprive
a
student
of
the
right
to
read
a
book
because--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--if
students
object,
i
don't
think
is
the
relevant
factor.
what
i
do
mean
to
say
is
that
that
process
of
selecting
one
textbook
over
another
will
rarely,
if
ever,
raise
constitutional
questions,
and
that
is
no
part
of
this
case.
that
is
not
the
process
that
went
on
at
all
here.
nine
books
were
banned
totally
from
the
library
and
the
school
district.
we
don't
have
the
more
difficult
case,
and
the
more
difficult
case,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
not
arisen
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
in
the
abstract,
if
we
found...
if
the
record
says
that
we
will
not
use
a
book
by
eldridge
cleaver
as
a
textbook
because
he
is
a
black
panther
and
considered
disloyal
to
our
country,
my
theory
would
apply.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
then
you
get
into
teachers'
constitutional
rights
and
what
they
can
be
compelled
to
do.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
unless
a
school
board
could
make
a
determination
that
a
teacher
could
forego
teaching
a
book
as
a
matter
of
conscience,
if...
i
mean,
it
would
be
difficult
to
allow
a
teacher
to
refuse
a
book
simply
because
she
thought
that
eldridge
cleaver
was
disloyal.
i
don't
think
that
comment
or
that
view
is
entitled
to
any
deference
by
the
state.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
they
do.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
have
no
doubt
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
don't
think
that
a
student
has
any
constitutional
right
not
to
read
a
book
that
is
assigned
by
a
teacher.
i
don't
think
this
case
presents
what
might
otherwise
be--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--the
limits
of
our
position.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--our
position
i
do
not
think
is
very...
a
very
extensive
one.
we
do
not
deny
that
island
trees
has
the
right
to
transmit
its
local
community
values
through
the
schools,
including
through
the
book
selection
process.
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about.
all
we
say
is
that
there
are
some
limits
on
what
they
can
do
in
the
name
of
education,
in
the
name
of
their
good
taste,
in
the
name
of
preserving
members
of
the
community
from
taking
offense.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
on
what
a
school
board
can
do?
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
have
no
standard
in
mind,
your
honor,
and
obviously
those
cases
get
us
into
first
amendment
quicksand,
but
there
may
be,
there
may
be
such
a
case,
such
a
book
which
would
fall
within
that
category.
the
problem
is
that
if
we
defer
entirely
to
school
boards
by
saying,
if
they
label
it
vulgar,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
do
not
concede
for
a
moment
that
they
could
ban
every
book
that
contains
a
vulgar
word.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
they
can't.
there
is
no--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--there
is
no--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
am
sorry.
i
was
not
clear,
your
honor.
there
is
no
constitutional
obligation
to
buy
these
particular
nine
books.
that
is
not
our
theory
at
all.
we
are
dealing
with
motive,
and
in
first
amendment--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
have
no
idea.
one
assumes...
it
is
not
in
the
record.
one
assumes
that
the
librarian
consulted
various
rating
journals.
what
is
in
the
record
is
that
every
single
one
of
these
books
is
recommended
for
use
in
high
school
libraries.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
organizations
like
the
wilson
library
journal,
the
school
library
journal,
organizations
of
librarians
and
educators.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is,
like
this
case,
a
case
that
raises
the
question
of
vulgarity.
it
is
not
a
radio
case,
and
the
court
exhibited
particular
concern
for
the
special
quality
of
radios
intruding
themselves
into
homes.
the
court
exhibited
particular
concern
for
young
six-year-old
children
who
might
hear
these
broadcasts.
the
court
exhibited
concern
for
a
monologue
that
was
pervasively
vulgar,
and
that
is
where
the
phrase
comes
from.
none
of
these
books
are
pervasively
vulgar.
they
have
random
instances
of
bad
language.
now,
we
don't
have
to
go
so
far
as
the
court
did
in
cohen
versus
california
to
say
that
each
of
these
phrases
in
these
books
is
protected,
as
the
court
did
say
in
cohen.
what
we
do
say
is
that
you
can't
ban
an
antiwar
book
because
it
reports
about
cohen's
case,
even
if
the
school
board
calls
it
vulgar.
but
there
is
something
else
to
be
said
about
this
case,
and
i
don't
want
the
court
simply
to
focus
on
vulgarity,
because
there
is
in
the
record,
and
judge
newman
was
concerned
about
the
ideological
concerns,
what
they
said
about
cleaver.
they
said
about
malcolm
x,
whose
essay
had
appeared
in
a
reader
for
writers,
that
he
was
a
traitor
to
his
country,
and
this
book
equated
him
with
the
founding
fathers.
in
post-litigation,
we
asked
him
which
of
these
books
was
anti-american,
because
a
press
release
had
said
that
one
of
the
books
was
anti-american,
and
their
example
was
a
book
called
a
hero
ain't
nothing
but
a
sandwich,
a
book
by
alice
childress,
a
national
children's
book
award
winner.
and
they
quoted
a
passage
in
which
a
black
school
teacher,
nigeria
green,
says
to
her
class
that
george
washington
was
a
slaveholder,
and
she
muses
about
the
irony
of
him,
a
founding
father,
having
been
a
slaveholder.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
i
do
not.
now
to
your
question
about
motivation
to
mr.
lipp,
it
of
course
does
come
into
first
amendment
analysis
in
the
discharge
situation.
men
and
women
can
get
discharged
from
jobs
for
legitimate
and
illegitimate
reasons.
we
don't
talk
about
tenure
here.
that
disparaging
phrase
has
been
used
by
some
of
the
courts
rejecting
our
principles.
we
simply
say
that
as
in
the
discharge
situation,
there
are
permissible
and
impermissible
reasons
for
substituting
books.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
those
are
permissible.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
they
surely
are.
no
one
is
making
a
judgment
there
that
this
book
is
being
eliminated
because
somebody
in
our
community,
or
a
group,
or
even
the
majority
in
our
community
will
be
offended
by
certain
passages
in
it.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
aside
from
the
discharge
cases,
no,
but
i
think
what
those
cases
tell
us
is
that
the
same
act
may
be
constitutional
and
unconstitutional
depending
on
the
reasons.
you
can
fire
mr.
doyle
in
mount
healthy
because
he
did
something
that
he
is
not
supposed
to
do
as
a
teacher,
but
you
can't
fire
him
because
he
advocates
a
certain
point
of
view.
you
can--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--they
are
two
different
acts,
but
in
resolving
that
constitutional
question,
one
does
have
to
look
at
motive,
and
in
substituting
a
book,
say,
like
silas
marner
for
a
hero
ain't
nothing
but
a
sandwich,
it
is
one
thing
if
they
say
silas
marner
is
a
better
written
book
and
we
are
going
to
use
that
in
our
curriculum.
it
is
something
else
to
say,
we
are
not
going
to
have
a
hero
ain't
nothing
but
a
sandwich
in
our
curriculum
because
it
says
an
unpleasant
historical
fact.
that
the
first
amendment
will
not
permit.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
am
not
sure
that
is
true,
at
least--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--well,
there
is
a
doctrine
in
1983
law
where
courts
do
scrutinize
whether
or
not
allegations
are
made
in
good
faith,
and
of
course
that
is
an
advocate's
obligation
under
the
rules.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
but
you
may
not
get...
you
may
get
up
to
summary
judgment
in
any
case
by
a
well-drafted
complaint,
but
i
don't
think
that
imposes
great
burdens
on
the
courts.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
this
cause
of
action
has
existed
for
eleven
years,
and
there
are
about
a
dozen
cases
around
the
lower
courts.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is
entirely
possible,
but
i
repeat
that
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
cause
of
action
that
invites
a
flood
of
litigation
any
more
than
it
has
in
the
past,
and
i
think
if
the
courts
abdicate,
if
the
federal
courts
say
that
anything
school
boards
say
and
do
about
books
is
beyond
judicial
review,
that
you
leave
people
remediless
for
the
assertion
of
very
important
rights.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
do
not.
i
don't
quarrel
for
a
minute,
even
if
i
could,
with
the
court's
decision
in
ginsberg,
which
says
there
are
variable
obscenity
standards,
and
i
don't
think
our
position
here
challenges
that
at
all.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
they
are.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
they
are.
important
to
say
two
things,
your
honor.
one,
no
elementary
school
children
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
high
school
children.
two--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--junior
high
school.
that's
correct.
junior
high
school.
though
the
only
book
in
the
junior
high
school
library
hear
was
a
reader
for
writers,
the
one
about
which
they
said
malcolm
x
was
a
traitor
to
his
country,
and
it
is
not
alleged
it
had
any
vulgarity
whatsoever.
let
me
say
finally
on
the
issue
of
vulgarity
that
aside
from
all
these
very
explicitly
political
references
in
the
record
which
led
judge
newman
to
think
that
a
trial
was
warranted,
there
is
also
the
critical
fact
that
this
post-litigation
concern
for
vulgarity
is
somewhat
suspect.
if
this
is
a
dominant
concern
of
this
school
board,
one
would
assume--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--well,
he
didn't
make--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--he
didn't
make...
with
respect,
your
honor,
he
didn't
make
a
finding
that
that
was
their
justification.
he
didn't
separate
out
political
from
vulgar.
what
he
said
was,
all
of
this
was
objected
to
because
it
offended
their
community
values,
and
they
have
the
right
to
do
that,
but
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
is,
if
that
is
their
concern
pre
or
post-litigation,
one
would
have
assumed
that
at
some
point
the
school
board
would
have
gone
back
to
the
library
and
seen
if
there
were
any
other
books
with
this
kind
of
language.
they
had
never
done
so
before,
and
they
have
never
done
so
since.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
know
that
is
an
unappetizing
undertaking.
i
see--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
don't
know
that
a...
i
don't--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--i
don't
know
that
a
school
board...
a
federal
court
has
to
read
all
these
books.
what
we
have
in
this
record
is
a
concern
with
eight
words
in
a
book
like
the
fixer,
and
that
is
not
a
constitutionally
permissible
basis.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
the
court
may
have
to
try
and
elucidate
some
standards,
but
i
think
the
court
has
to
begin
with
saying
that
a
half-dozen
vulgar
words
in
the
course
of
a
book
is
not
the
basis
for
banning
it.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
in
a
conflict
between
a
local
school
board
and
a
federal
judge
with
regard
to
the
banning
of
books,
a
local
school
board
must
abide
by
constitutional
standards
as
interpreted
by
the
federal
courts.
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
if
they--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--if
they
made
those
judgments
on
the
basis
of
the
kinds
of
criteria,
educational
suitability,
assuming
that
was
fleshed
out
in
relevance
to
the
community,
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible.
that
process
goes
on--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--that...
i
am
sorry--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--depending
on
the
reasons
they
give,
justice
stevens.
if
these
books--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--then
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
my--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
committee--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--because
of
the
reasons
they
gave
for
removing
these
books.
because
they
considered
the
books
solely
on
the
basis
of
excerpts.
mr.
lipp
says
before
we
agree
that
they
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
of
these
books
were
considered
as
a
whole.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
they
say
they
read
the
whole
books,
though--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--no,
we
took
that
position,
however,
and
there
are
depositions
in
this
record,
and
indeed,
the
9-g
statement,
the
southern...
the
eastern
district's
local
rule
in
summary
judgment
cases
says
that
some
of
these
books
were
banned
on
the
basis
of
isolated
themes,
even
when
the
theme
of
the
entire
book
was
to
the
contrary.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is
entirely
possible,
but
it
is
clear
that
he
made
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
isolated
passage.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
i
don't.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
do
not
whatsoever.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
and
i
don't
think
the
federal
courts
are
better
suited
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
what
has
happened...
first
of
all
we
take
issue
with
the
district
judge's
conclusion.
we
did
not
concede
that
in
summary
judgment.
that
is
his
reading
of
the
record,
and
he
draws
those
inferences,
though
judge
newman
was
not
at
all
willing
to
abide
by
those
inferences.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
we
do
have
that,
but
there
is
simply
no
disputing
what
they
say
here
about
cleaver
and
about
malcolm
x
and
about
george
washington
being
a
slaveholder.
that
is
all
in
the
record.
that
is
not
about
vulgarity.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
don't
think
that
a
school
board
can
cloak
its
political
concerns
in
the
mantle
of
educational
suitability.
they
may
say
that,
and
they
may
want
the
court
to
believe
that
is
what
went
on
here,
but
they
did
in
fact
make
some
very
explicit
political
judgments.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
reason,
your
honor,
is,
there
isn't
a
claim
that
there
is
a
single
vulgar
word
in
all
of
a
reader
for
writers.
there
is
nothing
said
about
a
reader
for
writers
that
suggests
vulgarity.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
correct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
