mr.
robert
layton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
claim
preclusion
case.
it
centers
on
a
judgment
of
the
new
york
appellate
division,
first
department,
one
of
that
state's
second
highest
appellate
courts.
in
light
of
what
has
been
said
here
earlier,
i
must
emphasize
that
this
was
a
final
judgment
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
its
finality
emanates
from
a
legislative
act,
new
york
executive
law
section
298,
which
reads
as
follows.
mr.
robert
layton
no,
sir,
your
honor.
absolutely
not.
we
don't
think
that
1739
is
in
the
remotest
way
relevant.
1739
is
a
statute
which
merely
deals
with
the
books
and
records
such
as
birth
certificate
entries,
driver's
license
entries
in
one
state
and
another
state.
it
does
not
deal
and
purport
to
deal
with
the
preclusive
effect
of
administrative
agency
determinations.
secondarily,
we
believe
title
7,
properly
read,
specifically
intended
not
to
give
preclusive
effect
to
state
agency
determinations.
that
is
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
what
is
missed
here
is
the
fact
that
this
was
a
judgment
of
a
court,
and
i
believe
that
section
1738,
under
traditional
doctrines
of
claim
preclusion
which
have
been
enforced
by
this
court
for
at
least
200
years,
is
the
proper
guide
here.
the
question
follows
thereafter
as
to
whether
title
7,
in
1964
and
1972,
repealed
in
any
manner
the
pre-existing
judicial
and
statutory
circumstances,
and
it
is
our
belief
that
without
even
reaching
the
doctrine
of
repeal,
that
these
two
statutes
are
read
together
easily
and
there
is
no
difficulty
because
the
position
asserted
by
petitioner
and
the
government
is
fundamentally
incorrect.
title
7
and
its
language,
as
justice
white
correctly
indicated,
used
the
language,
"state
and
local
authorities".
beyond
that,
in
the
statute
itself,
"state
and
local
agencies"
are
used
interchangeably
with
"state
and
local
authorities".
indeed,
as
recognized
by
the
eeoc,
its
own
regulations,
which
we
have
quoted
in
the
supplemental
appendix,
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
supplemental
appendix
page
59
to
60,
this
is
the
eeoc,
29
cfr,
deferrals
to
state
and
local
authorities.
see
706
agency
defined.
and
these
regulations
are
replete...
year
after
year
eeoc
has
defined
what
they
think
state
and
local
authorities
are,
and
they
are
agencies.
the
statutory
history
of
the
act
refers
to
state
fair
employment
agencies.
there
is
a
substantial
and
a
critical
difference
between
an
agency
and
a
court,
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
its
decision
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver,
which
has
been
cited
by
petitioner
on
its
behalf,
but
i
think
incorrectly,
and
with
respect,
at
415
us
47,
there
is
a
critical
statement
by
the
court
in
alexander
which
reads,
if
i
may,
as
follows:
"consistent
with
this
view,
title
7
provides
for
consideration
of
employment
discrimination
claims
in
several
forums.
"
and
the
court
then
cites
the
statute.
the
first
is
eeoc.
the
second
is
state
and
local
agencies.
the
third
is
federal
courts.
it
then
says,
"and
in
general,
submission
of
a
claim
to
one
forum
does
not
preclude
a
later
submission
to
another.
"
and
its
footnote
clearly
indicates
by
that
it
meant
that
commission
action
is
not
barred
by
findings
and
orders
of
state
or
local
agencies,
and
then
it
calls
attention
to
mcdonald-douglas
v.
green,
which
holds
that
proposition.
the
mere
fact
that
the
eeoc
did
not
find
probable
cause
is
no
bar.
congress,
as
recognized
by
this
court,
was
understanding
that
there
were
three
forums
involved,
the
eeoc,
state
and
local
agencies,
and
then
the
federal
court,
and
none
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
read
against
that.
mr.
robert
layton
yes.
mr.
robert
layton
that
is
a
choice.
mr.
robert
layton
that's
right.
mr.
robert
layton
yes,
he
has
that
choice,
and
i
should--
mr.
robert
layton
--well,
if
he
doesn't
go
into
the
state
courts,
he
clearly
has
the
right
to
preserve
his
right
to
a
de
novo
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
robert
layton
he
just
can't
have
it
both
ways.
he
can't
go
the
state
route,
come
to
its
conclusion,
be
dissatisfied,
and
start
again.
mr.
robert
layton
well,
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
he
is
only
precluded
from
entering
the
federal
courts
for
60
days.
on
the
61st
day
he
can
bring
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
and
i
must--
mr.
robert
layton
--if
he
has
not
gone
the
state
judicial
route.
mr.
robert
layton
now,
petitioner
has
said
that
in
some
manner
mr.
kremer
here
was
directed
virtually
or
told
that
he
had
to
appeal,
and
i
think
that
is
a
substantial
misstatement.
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix,
page
17,
which
is
the
notice
of
order,
and
what
he
is
told
by
the
state
human
rights
appeal
board
is,
"any
complainant,
respondent,
or
other
person
aggrieved
by
this
order
may.
"
--i
underscore
"may"...
"obtain
judicial
review
thereof".
the
following
sentence
says,
"such
proceeding
shall
be
brought"
if
he
decides
to
do
it.
then
if
he
wants
to
do
it
he
must
bring
it
in
the
appellate
division.
but
there
is
no
order
or
direction
to
him.
as
justice
stevens
indicated,
it
is
a
choice
that
he
has.
i
must
clear
up
one
or
two
i
think
erroneous
assumptions
regarding
the
new
york
state
administrative
procedures.
i
think
a
question
was
asked
by
justice
o'connor.
it
is
quite
plain
that
a
number
of
procedures
are
available
to
the
petitioner,
to
the
claimant.
he
must
present
sufficient
factual
material
to
convince
the
agency
to
take
the
matter
further.
in
particular,
he
must,
and
if
he
does
so,
he
is
empowered
to
have
the
agency
issue
subpoenas.
i
call
your
attention
to
supplemental
appendix,
64.
we
have
quoted
the
agency's
regulations.
application
for
subpoena.
"subpoenas
and
subpoenas
duces
tecum
may
be
issued
by
the
designated
division
officers
and
employees
upon
the
application
of
a
party
or
party's
attorney.
"
he
has
to
act.
mr.
robert
layton
at
any
stage
of
the
investigation,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
layton
before
the
division.
that
can
be
during
the
factual
investigatory
stage,
or
at
the
hearing
stage,
the
public
hearing
stage.
but,
yes,
he
doesn't
have
an
absolute
right.
i
don't
say
that
he
has
an
absolute
right.
he
simply
has
to
ask.
mr.
robert
layton
well,
the
subpoena
duces
tecum...
the
following
sentence
says
"issuance
of
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
at
the
instance
of
a
party
who
appears
without
attorney
shall
depend
upon
a
showing
of
necessity.
"
there
is
discovery
in
terms
of
the
subpoena
duces
tecum.
however,
i
don't
suggest
that
it
is
an
absolute
right
he
has.
he
asks
for
it.
if
he
shows
the
necessity,
the
division,
which
is--
mr.
robert
layton
--no.
no,
it
is
not
the
identical
type
of
discovery,
nor
is
it
a
duplication
of
the
federal
district
court,
nor
do
we
think
that
it
is
required.
we
believe
that
congress
was
dealing
with
employment
discrimination
in
the
same
manner
that
new
york
state
was
dealing
with
employment
discrimination
for
well
over
40
years.
mr.
robert
layton
with
the
following
caveat,
justice
brennan,
that
if
he
believes
that
somehow
the
agency
hasn't
treated
him
properly,
hasn't
acted
on
a
subpoena
request,
hasn't
properly
investigated
the
matter,
he
can
raise
that
issue
in
the
human
rights
appeal
board
and
before
the
appellate
division,
which
is
what
this
petitioner
did.
mr.
robert
layton
no,
once
he...
he
could
raise
that
at
the
human
rights
appeal
board.
mr.
robert
layton
but
once
he
goes
into
the
state
court,
he
is
entitled
to
raise
that
question,
but
then
he--
mr.
robert
layton
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
layton
for
whatever
reason.
all
i
am
saying
is,
along
the
way,
and
in
the
appellate
division,
he
can
raise
all
those
procedural
difficulties,
and
that
court
has
ruled
on
those
on
numerous
occasions,
and
reversed
the
division,
and
sent
the
matter
back
for
reconsideration.
mr.
robert
layton
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
layton
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
because
congress
has
specifically
said
that
for
60
days
he
has
to
go...
he
has
to
go
to
a
state
agency,
administrative
agency,
and
he
still
retains
the
right
to
come
back.
i
believe
utah
mining
is
a
case
that
holds
that
where
the
administrative
agency
procedure
in
toto
is
almost
a
replica
of
an
entire
court
proceeding,
then
it
may...
it
may
be
found
to
have
preclusive
effect.
we
don't
argue
here
that
congress
thought
by
sending
a
claimant
to
the
state
agencies
and
giving
them
an
opportunity,
primarily
through
conciliation,
and
through
some
effort
at
solving
the
problem...
it
wasn't
an
adversary
proceeding
that
congress
was
sending
them
toward
necessarily.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
what
congress
intended,
and
we
don't
think
he
should
be
precluded
there
at
all.
mr.
robert
layton
it
said
that
he
was.
mr.
robert
layton
not
precluded.
mr.
robert
layton
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
layton
i
think
it
would
be,
because
we
believe
that
that
really
is
up
to
the
new
york
state
legislature
and
the
new
york
state
courts
to
determine
what
kind
of
preclusive
effect
would
be
granted--
mr.
robert
layton
--what
we
are
concerned
about,
and
we
have
said,
is
that
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
wanted
to
trap
title
7
claimants,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
thought
that
they
should
be
relegated
to
second
class
kind
of
treatment
in
the
states.
we
do
believe
that
in
that
unusual
circumstance,
and
we
think
it
is
unusual--
mr.
robert
layton
--well,
but
your
postulate
is
a
very
narrow
right
of
appeal.
mr.
robert
layton
yes.
but
to
answer
your
question,
we
still
think
that
is
preclusive.
what
we
would
say
is
not
preclusive
is
that
the
state
set
up
a
sham
or
a
phoney
system.
i
think
congress
was
concerned
about
that,
and
we
would...
we
have
a
view
that
that
kind
of
transparent
judicial
non-review
would
not
or
should
not
command
preclusive
effect.
but
we
believe
that
congress
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
this
statute
was
aware
of
what,
if
i
may
refer
to
as
the
ordinary
rules
of
the
game,
that
litigation
exists,
that
the
ordinary
rules
have
applied
for
over
200
years,
and
there
is
nothing
that
we
have
uncovered
that
would
indicate
that
it
didn't;
to
the
extent
that
we
have
uncovered
anything,
there
would
be
an
indication,
and
the
comment
we
quoted
of
senator
javits,
that
to
the
extent
congress
considered
the
matter
at
all,
they
were
aware
that
in
1972,
claim
preclusion,
res
judicata
was
alive
and
well--
mr.
robert
layton
--yes,
we--
mr.
robert
layton
--we
don't
need
to
make
it.
yes.
mr.
robert
layton
we
don't
need
to.
mr.
robert
layton
i
would
go
a
little
further,
your
honor.
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
new
york
gaslight--
mr.
robert
layton
--i
would
just
like
to
point
out,
your
honor,
in
new
york
gaslight
against
carey,
a
decision
of
this
court,
the
state
proceeding
went
to
its
conclusion
through
the
new
york
courts.
there
wasn't
a
doubt
in
anyone's
mind,
the
court's
or
the
parties',
that
the
employer
there
was
not
free
to
relitigate
that
claim,
and
it
is
our
view
that
here
the
determination
of
the
agency
affirmed
by
the
court
was
in
the
nature
of
a
summary
judgment
treatment
of
his
claim
on
the
merit.
mr.
robert
layton
on
the
merits.
he
happened
to--
mr.
robert
layton
--that
is
as
far
as
i
need
to
go.
all
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
layton
you
mean,
compel
all
discrimination
claimants
to
appeal--
mr.
robert
layton
--slim.
i
think
the
answer
is
the
answer
i
gave
to
justice
stevens,
which
is
that
on
the
61st
day
a
claimant
would
then...
he
could
enter
the
federal
district
court.
i
do
suggest
that
if
there
were
some
devilish
scheme
that
was
concocted
which
somehow
compelled
him,
trapped
him
and
held
him
into
the
state
system,
i
do
think
that
is
a
matter
at
a
later
date,
and
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
this
court
might
well
take,
but
i
do
think
that
under
the
present
rules,
on
the
61st
day
he
has
easily
the
freedom
to
try
his
case
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
robert
layton
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
really
think
so.
i
think
that
he
still
has
a
choice,
your
honor.
you
say
trapped
by
an
appeal.
i
do
think
that
it
is
a
voluntary
act
on
the
part
of
a
litigant
to
take
an
appeal,
as
federated
department
stores
against
mortey
indicated.
the
parties
there
decided
not
to
appeal.
this
petitioner
decided
to
appeal.
there
was
no
compulsion
exercised
on
his
free
choice.
i
would
point
out
that
the...
as
i
have
indicated,
the
line
of
cases
that
we
are
aware
of
of
this
court,
starting
from
earliest
times,
through
allen
and
mccurray,
mandate
an
affirmance
here,
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
anything
further
to
add
to
what
i
have
said.
if
there
are
any
other
questions,
i
would
be
happy
to
deal
with
them.
thank
you.
