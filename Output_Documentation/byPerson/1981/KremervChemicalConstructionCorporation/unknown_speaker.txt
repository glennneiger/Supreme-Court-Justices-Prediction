unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
title
7
was
an
implied
repeal
of
section
1738,
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
address
them
in
those
terms
for
a
moment.
do
you
contend
it
was
or
wasn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly,
but
the
full
force
and
effect
of
the
review
by
the
appellate
division
in
new
york
would
not
be
given
full
effect
if
your
contention
prevails,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
suppose
that
a
formal
hearing
could
have
been
held
had
the
petitioner
requested
it.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
it
is
helpful?
unknown
speaker
would
your
position
be
different
here
if
the
court
review
was
de
novo?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes,
it
would
be?
unknown
speaker
none
of
those
cases
involved
a
state
court
determination,
though,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
in
that
regard,
section
1738
really
only
refers
to
a
state
judicial
proceeding,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
going
back
to
the
state
proceedings
in
this
case,
which
you
addressed
a
few
minutes
ago
in
response
to
my
question,
would
you
say
that
it
is
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
a
summary
judgment
proceeding
that
at
least
the
petitioner
had
an
opportunity
to
offer
testimony
or
affidavits
or
such
things
to
avoid
the
result
that
occurred,
and
simply
didn't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
he
could
not
have
offered
such
evidence
to
the
state
agency?
unknown
speaker
but
the
agency
had
the
power
to
compel
the
respondent
to
produce
records.
unknown
speaker
if
he
had
been
afforded
the
full
hearing
on
all
the
claims
he
is
now
seeking
to
make
at
the
state
level,
and
that
were
reviewed
in
the
state
appellate
court,
would
your
position
be
the
same
as
it
is
today,
that
there
still
is
a
de
novo--
unknown
speaker
--you
said,
mr.
barrett,
did
you,
that
the
claimant
can't
force
the
agency
into
discovery
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
that
belongs...
that
determination
has
to
be
made
by
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
but
had
the
agency
engaged
in
extensive
discovery
proceedings,
and
they
had
been
the
basis
of
the
decisions
both
administratively
and
in
the
appellate
division,
then
i
gather
the
district
court,
when
the
claimant
came
back
there,
would
be
in
a
position
to
perhaps
say,
well,
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done?
unknown
speaker
to
federal
employees,
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
am
just
curious,
the
way
you
put
it
and
the
way
it
is
in
your
brief.
you
say,
the
united
states
and
the
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
those
are
two
different--
unknown
speaker
--and
so
you
would
be
here
even
if
the
eeoc
wasn't?
unknown
speaker
does
the
eeoc
have
a
right
to
carry
on
its
own
litigation
up
through
this
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wallace,
take
an
entirely
different
area
of
the
law.
supposing
we
are
talking
about
security,
and
the
plaintiff
has
a
state
securities
case,
it
goes
all
the
way
up
through
the
state
court
system,
loses,
then
he
brings
an
action
under
10(b)(5)
in
the
federal
system.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
federal
securities
law
that
says
the
federal
court
has
to
give
any
sort
of
weight
to
the
state
proceedings.
would
you
say
that
1738
didn't
apply
there?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
state
court
had
found
that
there
simply
was
no
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
1738
covers
collateral
estoppel
too?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
that...
if
there
had
been
a
de
novo
determination
in
the
state
court
that
there
had
been
no
discrimination,
the
very
fact
that
is
at
issue
in
the
federal
case,
i
can't
believe
you
are
suggesting
that
title
7
then
nevertheless
mandates
that
that
independent
determination
is
not
binding.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
so
you
are--
unknown
speaker
--it
has
always
been
in
the
discussion.
unknown
speaker
what
does
your
provision
that
you
are
relying
on
say?
unknown
speaker
what
does
authority
mean?
unknown
speaker
normally,
if
you
are
talking
about
courts,
you
usually
don't
call
them
authorities,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
some
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
that
includes
courts?
unknown
speaker
that
is
one
way
of
putting
it,
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
court
decision
that
would
bind
that
person
and
the
state,
or
and
the
other
side
he
couldn't
restart
that
case
in
the
state
system.
unknown
speaker
or,
he
couldn't
relitigate
that
fact
of
discrimination,
even
if
he
brought
another
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
how
can
you
say...
suppose
in
this
very
case,
after
this
very
case,
he
brought
another
proceeding
under
another
statute
in
the
state,
and
his
claim
was
he
had
been
discriminated
against.
are
you
saying
in
that
second
state
court
proceeding
that
this
judgment
would
not
be
binding?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
wouldn't
1738
pick
it
up
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
talking
about
a
fact
determination.
we
are
talking
about
a
fact
determination.
if
that
fact
determination
would
be
binding
in
state
proceedings,
why
wouldn't
it
be
binding
in
a
federal
proceeding?
surely
the
causes
of
action
are
different.
of
course
they
are.
but
we
are
talking
about
a
factual
determination,
and
collateral
estoppel.
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
saying
that
title
7
did
effect
a
partial
repeal
of
1738.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
could
be
put
aside,
too.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
because
i
know
you
will
get
to
it
in
a
minute,
but
if
there
were
no
appeal
to
the
new
york
court,
but
really
merely
just
an
administrative
finding
in
the
new
york
system,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
you
are
making
today
but
base
it
on
1739
instead?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
you
another
question?
unknown
speaker
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
then,
is
that
if
a
plaintiff
or
a
claimant
loses
in
the
state
agency,
he
then
has
a
right
under
state
law
to
appeal
and
he
might
also
be
able
to
bring
a
federal
suit.
he
is
faced
with
an
election
then.
he
has
to
choose--
unknown
speaker
--he
has
to
choose--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
he
goes
the
appeal
route,
he
looses
his
federal
rights,
but
he
must
make
a
choice
right
then
and
there.
that
is
the
way
you
read
the
statutory--
unknown
speaker
--but
he
must
make
a
choice
there,
because
either
way
he
goes,
it
is
the
end
of
the
matter
for
him.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
he
also
really
couldn't
go
into
the
federal
court
and
appeal
on
the
state
court
because
he
might
lose
on
appeal
while
the
federal
action
is
pending.
he
really
has
to
make
a
choice,
one
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
provided
he
hasn't
gone
the
state
judicial
route.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
subpoenas
to
appear
where?
unknown
speaker
before
whom?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
comparable
to
discovery
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
discovery
in
any
event
that
he
might
have
in
your
supreme
court,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
i
must
say,
i
gather
your
position
is
nevertheless
that
if
he
is
unhappy
with
the
record
that
is
made
before
the
administrative
agency,
then
what
he
must
do
when
he
is
finished
with
the
agency
proceeding
is
to
go
right
into
federal
court.
otherwise,
he
will
lose
his
right
to
go
into
the
federal
court
if
he
takes
an
appeal.
unknown
speaker
without
forfeiting
his
right
to
go
into
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at,
as
i
understood
your
position
earlier,
he
can't
go
into
the
federal
court
once
he
goes
into
your
appellate
division.
unknown
speaker
for
whatever
reason
he
goes
there.
unknown
speaker
under
our
decision
in
united
states
against
utah
construction
company,
the
court
has
held
that
there
can
be
preclusive
effect
from
an
administrative
finding
as
well
as
a
judicial
one.
unknown
speaker
so
that
isn't
it
possible
under
your
construction
that
he
could
simply
lose
before
the
state
human
rights
agency
and
then
go
directly
into
district
court
and
still
be
precluded?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
said
that
he
wasn't,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
he
was
not
precluded?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know
there
is
some
disagreement
about
the
scope
of
the
new
york
judicial
review,
not
too
much,
but
would
it
matter
to
your
position
what
the
judicial
proceeding
entailed?
for
example,
supposing
you
had
a
state
statute
that
said
the
only
thing
that
the
court
can
review
is
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
in
the
agency.
would
that
be
enough
to
bring
1738
into
play?
they
argue,
in
effect,
as
i
understand
it
here,
that
the
appellate
process
really
doesn't
reveal
the
merits
of
the
discrimination
charge.
it
just
reviews
for
procedural
error.
suppose
it
was
for
jurisdictional
error.
would
your
view
still
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
congress
intended
to
draw
that
kind
of
distinction?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
second
class
only
in
the
sense
that
they
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
to
argue
for
any
kind
of
preclusion
here
other
than
in
a
case
where
the
state
judicial
proceeding
purports
to
include
a
judgment
that
the
discrimination
determination
was
not
arbitrary
or
unreasonable.
that
is
all
you
need
to
get
preclusion.
you
don't
need
to
say
that...
suppose
the
only
issue...
suppose
there
was
an
administrative
finding,
and
the
only
issue
that
the
claimant
took
to
the
courts
was,
he
was
denied
the
right
to...
he
was
denied
a
subpoena,
and
he
was
turned
down.
he
was
turned
down.
now,
you
are
really
making
a
res
judicata
argument
rather
than
a
collateral
estoppel
argument,
if
you
say
there
is
preclusion
there.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
need
to
make
that.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
saying
here
that
the
judgment
of
no
probable
cause
to
believe
there
is
discrimination
was
not
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to...
if
you
think
you
have
to,
you
may
lose.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
that
is
as
far
as
you
need
to
go.
unknown
speaker
mr.
layton,
under
your
theory,
now,
i
suppose
that
a
state
that
basically
were
hostile
to
title
7
claims
could
set
up
a
system
for
these
claims
to
grant,
for
instance,
an
automatic
right
to
review
in
the
state
appellate
proceedings
for
all
these
claims
and
then
preclude
everybody
thereafter.
unknown
speaker
sure.
i
mean,
wouldn't...
under
your
theory,
isn't
it
possible
that
a
state
that
basically
was
hostile
to
permitting
title
7
claims
to
be
heard
in
the
federal
courts
could
set
up
a
system
that
would
effectively
preclude
everybody?
i
am
not
suggesting
the
state
would
set
up
a
system
that
was
unfair
within
the
state
hearing
processes.
that
would
be
a
different
question,
but
isn't
that
a
possibility?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
system,
or
your
theory,
a
claimant
might
well
be
better
advised
to
lose
in
the
state
proceeding
rather
than
be
trapped
by
an
appeal
at
the
state
level.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
