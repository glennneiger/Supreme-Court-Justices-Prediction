mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
the
united
states
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
see
the
matter,
the
holding
below
is
inconsistent
with
two
aspects
of
title
7's
scheme
and
policies,
and
is
contrary
to
the
rationale
of
at
least
three
of
this
court's
title
7
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
joined
together.
the
department
of
justice,
the
attorney
general
has
some
enforcement
responsibilities
under
title
7,
and
the
eeoc
has
others.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
but
they
have
joined
in
the
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
up
through
all
courts
other
than
the
supreme
court,
by
statute.
but
we
represent
the
eeoc
in
this
court.
the
two
aspects
of
the
scheme
and
policies
of
title
7
that
i
am
referring
to
are,
one,
that
in
holding
that
a
judgment
of
a
state
court
reviewing
a
state
agency's
action
on
a
state
law
claim
may
have
preclusive
effect
on
litigation
of
federal
claims
in
federal
court,
the
holding
below
would
discourage
the
full
pursuit
of
state
remedies
by
complainants
of
employment
discrimination,
precisely
the
policy
that
this
court
expressed
concern
about
in
its
decision
in
new
york
gaslight
club
against
carey.
the
policy
of
title
7
is
to
encourage
the
full
use
and,
congress
hoped,
the
resolution
of
many
employment
discrimination
claims
through
available
state
procedures,
and
that
policy
would
be
frustrated
if
full
pursuit
of
those
procedures
would
have
adverse
consequences
on
the
ability
to
assert
the
federal
claim.
the
other
aspect
of
title
7
that
we
find
irreconcilable
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
title
7
itself
specifies
that
the
eeoc
in
conducting
its
business
is
to
give
substantial
weight,
that
it
nowhere
says
anything
about
preclusive
effect,
it
says
substantial
weight
to
the
findings
of
state
authorities
that
have
previously
been
invoked
with
respect
to
the
same
claim.
now,
in
most
instances,
to
be
sure,
the
eeoc
is
unlikely
to
find
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred
when
there
has
been
an
adverse
resolution
to
the
complainant
in
the
state
proceedings,
but
there
are
instances
in
which,
in
light
of
everything
presented
during
its
investigation,
including
the
evidence
of
the
state
proceedings,
the
commission
in
giving
those
the
substantial
weight
congress
prescribes,
the
commission
concludes
that
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute
has
occurred.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
might
apply
in
that
instance.
i
don't
really
see
that
1738
plays
a
role
in
this
case,
with
all
respect,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
if
one
looks
at
1738,
all
it
says
is
that
the
judicial
proceedings
of
any
court
of
any
state
shall
have
the
same
full
faith
and
credit
in
every
court
within
the
united
states
and
its
territories
as
they
have
by
law
or
usage
in
the
courts
of
such
state.
all
that
the
state
court
decided
in
this
case
was
that
the
state
administrative
agency
did
not
act
arbitrarily
or
capriciously
or
abuse
its
discretion
or
make
a
procedural
error
under
state
law
in
dismissing
the
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
be
a
different
question,
and
i
believe
that
the
scheme
of
title
7
would
not
give
preclusive
effect
to
that,
although
weight
would
be
given
to
it,
but
if
i
may
finish
my
thought
here,
there
is
no
attempt
to
re-examine
in
the
federal
court
whether
an
error
was
made
by
the
state
administrative
agency
in
dismissing
a
complaint
under
state
law.
the
other
aspect
of
the
new
york
scheme
is
that
if
one
asserts
this
administrative
remedy,
then
it
cannot
resort
to
any
other
remedy
under
state
law.
there
is
no
attempt
being
made
in
federal
court
to
resort
to
any
other
remedy
under
state
law.
it
is
entirely
speculative
to
think
that
the
new
york
courts
would
give
this
judgment
any
preclusive
effect
in
a
title
7
suit.
our
position,
as
we
stated
in
the
court
last
term,
is
that
the
new
york
courts
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
title
7
suits,
and
the
question
would
never
even
arise.
in
any
event,
neither
the
agency
nor
the
reviewing
court
had
any
authority
under
new
york
law
to
consider
a
title
7
case
in
this
case.
so,
i
don't
see
that
1738
is
in
the
case,
myself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does,
but
there
is
no
attempt
being
made
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
precisely
what
i
am
suggesting,
although
it
is
not
in
this
case,
mr.
justice--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
i
started
to
say,
before
1738
came
into
the
discussion,
that
title
7--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
title
7
specifies
that
the
eeoc,
when
it
concludes
that
there
is
reasonable
cause,
has
to
attempt
to
conciliate.
that
is
what
title
7
charges
the
eeoc
to
do,
after
it
has
given
substantial
weight
to
the
state
findings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
says
that
the
commission
shall
give
substantial
weight
to
the
findings
of
a
state
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statute
doesn't
specify
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
legislative
history
indicated
that
congress
meant
for
the
complainants
to
use
whatever
state
procedures
were
available.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
need
to
bring
a
lawsuit
of
their
own
in
courts,
but
as
an
integral
part
of
the
administrative
process
that
new
york
provides--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--with
respect
to
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
state
law
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
there
had
been
a
state
court
determination
of
whether
there
had
been
discrimination,
which
is
not
this
case.
there
is
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
be
in
the
second
state
proceeding,
because
under
state
law--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
there
is...
there
is
no
attempt
here
to
invoke
any
other
state
remedy,
and
new
york
state
law
provides
that
if
he
elects
to
go
to
the
administrative
remedy
he
can't
invoke
a
judicial
remedy.
the
fact
that
he
sought
review
of
the
administrative
finding
against
him
is
irrelevant
under
new
york
law
to
whether
he
could
bring
any
other
remedy.
it
isn't
because
of
any
deference
to
the
new
york
court's
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
new
york
is
free
to
decide
what
will
be
binding
in
its
proceedings
and
what
won't
be.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i
do
think
that
1738
permits
for
more
specific
statutes
to
be
given
their
full
effect,
which
is
what
is
involved
here.
it
states
a
general
principle
of
law
which,
in
our
view,
really
isn't
a
part
of
this
case,
because
all
the
new
york
court
decided
was
not
whether
there
had
been
discrimination
or
not,
but
whether--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
agency
abused
its
discretion
in
dismissing
a
claim
under
new
york
law,
and
we
will
obviously
have
to
stand
on
our
brief
for
the
remainder
of
our
submission.
