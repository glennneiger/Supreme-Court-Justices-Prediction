mr.
david
a.
barrett
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
is
here
today
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
his
employment
discrimination
claim
under
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
to
be
dismissed
by
the
district
court
without
any
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
the
only
reason
for
the
dismissal
of
the
federal
title
7
action
was
that
petitioner
had
unsuccessfully
sought
relief
for
the
same
alleged
discriminatory
conduct
under
the
new
york
state
law
that
bans
discrimination
in
employment.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
because
congress
intended
to
permit
title
7
plaintiffs
to
pursue
their
remedies
under
state
law
fully
without
losing
the
right
to
a
de
novo
hearing
of
their
claims
in
federal
court.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
i
don't
really
think
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
address
the
questions
in
those
terms,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
well,
the
entire
statutory
scheme
of
title
7
presupposes
a
system
in
which
there
is
first
a
state
proceeding,
then
a
proceeding
before
the
eeoc,
then
a
proceeding
in
federal
court,
and
i
think
what
congress
intended
was
that
all
three
of
those
steps
should
be
given
their
full
force
and
effect.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that.
the
appellate
division
decided
a
question
of
state
law,
first
of
all.
it
didn't
address
petitioner's
title
7
claims
as
such,
but
that
is
really
beside
the
point.
i
think
the
basic
point
is
that
congress
intended
in
title
7
to
set
up
a
statutory
scheme
that
had
a
certain
duplication,
a
certain
overlapping
of
remedies,
and
that
intent
is
clear,
and
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
numerous
cases.
petitioner
was
discharged
by
respondent,
chemical
construction,
from
his
job
as
a
chemical
engineer,
and
he
was
denied
re-employment
on
several
occasions,
allegedly
on
the
basis
of
his
religion
and
national
origin.
petitioner
first
filed
his
complaint
with
the
eeoc,
but
the
eeoc
could
not
act
immediately
on
the
charge,
because
section
706(d)
of
title
7
requires
it
to
refer
the
charge
to
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights
for
processing
under
the
state
human
rights
law.
the
human
rights
division
eventually
dismissed
the
charge
because
it
said
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was
true.
that
state
agency
decision
is
the
only
consideration
that
any
government
body,
state
or
federal,
administrative
or
judicial,
has
ever
given
to
the
merits
of
petitioner's
claim
of
employment
discrimination,
yet
the
human
rights
division
dismissed
petitioner's
claim
without
ever
holding
any
formal
hearing.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
no,
that
is
not
quite
right,
justice
o'connor.
it
is
the
human
rights
division
that
decides
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause.
only
if
it
decides
there
is
probable
cause
is
a
hearing
then
held.
so
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
petitioner
requesting
it.
as
petitioner
was
entitled
to
do
under
state
law,
he
appealed
the
dismissal
of
his
complaint
both
to
an
administrative
appeal
board
and
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court,
and
i
think
it
is
important
in
further
response
to
you,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
state
legislature
found
it
necessary
to
provide
that
step,
additional
step
of
judicial
review
as
part
of
the
state
process
that
it
enacted
to
deal
with
employment
discrimination
claims.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
i
think
it
is
helpful,
your
honor,
because,
as
this
court
recognized
last
year
in
gaslight
club
against
carey,
the
state
procedure
is
really
the
whole.
it
is
an
integrated
procedure.
it
is
a
whole,
and
the
resort
to
state
court,
and
of
course
the
state
court
only
hears
the
claim
under
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
administrative
review
standard,
that
resort
to
state
court
is
properly
viewed
simply
as
an
additional
step
in
the
state
administrative
process,
a
final
step
if
you
will,
and
i
understand
that
it
is
a
court,
not
a
judicial
body,
but
nevertheless,
it
is
something
that
is
part
of
the
state
system
to
which
congress
intended,
indeed,
the
state
system
as
such
required
resort
to
initially.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
your
honor,
that
would
obviously
be
a
very
different
case
from
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be.
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
because
i
think
that
congress's
intent
in
enacting
title
7
is
what
controls
in
any
event.
now,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
several
earlier
cases,
the
appropriate
thing
for
a
federal
court
to
do
in
a
title
7
case
where
there
have
been
prior
proceedings,
be
they
state,
be
they
labor
arbitration,
be
they
some
other
form
of
administrative
review,
is
to
give
those
prior
proceedings
such
weight
as
the
district
judge
considering
all
the
circumstances
of
the
earlier
determination,
to
give
them
such
weight
as
the
district
court
finds
to
be
appropriate.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
it
is
true
that
that
is
what
section
1738
refers
to.
however,
the
common
law
and
section
1739,
which
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
both
make
it
clear
that
in
general,
a
state
administrative
determination
of
an
adjudicatory
nature
would
be
equally
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
and
i
think
we
can
see
clearly
that
congress
just
didn't
intend
those
general
procedural
rules
to
apply
to
title
7
cases,
because
it
required
resort
to
those
state
proceedings.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
quite
a
fair
analogy.
the
reason
is
that,
in
the
federal
court,
for
example,
before
you
get
summary
judgment...
before
you
can
move
successfully
for
summary
judgment,
you
have
the
opportunity
for
full
discovery.
there
was
nothing
like
that
afforded
to
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
might
have
deposition
evidence.
he
would
have
a
chance
to
look
through
respondent's
business
records.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
i
suppose
if
he
could
have
stolen
it,
he
could
have
gotten
it,
but
he
didn't
have
any
way
to
get
it
and
put
it
before
the
state
agency.
he
told
them
his
story.
respondent
told
them
its
story,
or
rather,
i
should
say,
it
told
a
single
investigator
who
looked
into
its
claim,
and
respondent
presumably
presented
the
story
that
was
going
to
benefit
it
most
fully.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
if
the
agency
decided
that
that
is
what
it
wanted
to
do.
it
is
perhaps
worth
noting
that
in
a
report
just
earlier
this
year,
the
new
york
state
bar
association,
a
committee
of
the
new
york
state
bar
association
that
was
composed
of
equal
numbers
of
representatives
of
employees
and
employers
reached
the
conclusion
that
with
respect
to
both
the
human
rights
division
and
the
administrative
appeal
board,
that
neither
agency
has
been
funded
to
the
degree
necessary
to
enable
it
satisfactorily
to
perform
its
responsibilities
under
the
human
rights
law.
i
am
not
saying
that
that
necessarily
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
but
that
is
a
bit
of
the
flavor
of
the
kind
of
administrative
proceeding
that
may
exist
in
the
states.
i
would
also
just
like
to
point
out
that
once
again,
neither
the
administrative
appeal
board
nor
the
appellate
division
had
any
authority
to
hold
any
sort
of
de
novo
hearing
on
petitioner's
claim,
and
moreover,
with
respect
to
his
going
into
state
court,
the
administrative
decision
that
he
received
from
the
appeal
board
told
him,
and
i
quote,
that
he
could
"obtain
judicial
review"
and
that
"such
proceedings
shall
be
brought
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court.
"
now,
ultimately
both
of
those
state
bodies
denied
relief,
and
petitioner
finally
returned
to
the
eeoc,
which,
giving,
as
it
must,
substantial
weight
to
the
state
proceedings,
also
found
that
there
was
no
reasonable
cause.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
it
would
be
the
same,
justice
o'connor.
it
would
be
the
same
as
i
think
i
told
justice
white,
that
the
district
court
could
not
dismiss
the
case
out
of
hand
on
the
basis
of
preclusion.
it
could
give
those
proceedings
appropriate
weight
in
light
of
all
the
factors
that
you
have
described,
and
in
such
a
case
it
might
give
them
very
heavy
weight.
there
might
be,
indeed,
almost
nothing
to
do
but
to
submit
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
have
the
district
court
decide
the
case.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
that
is
essentially
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
yes.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
that
is
exactly
right,
and
the
respondent
perhaps
could
move
for
summary
judgment
on
that
basis.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
disrupts
the
very
carefully
thought
out
and
very
extensively
debated
statutory
scheme
that
congress
enacted
in
title
7.
it
allows
one
small
part
of
the
state
proceedings
to
pre-empt
the
remaining
steps
in
the
federal
system
that
congress
intended
to
be
available
to
remedy
job
discrimination.
one
way
that
we
can
see
this
is
in
this
court's
decision
in
chandler
against
roudabush.
there,
the
court
extensively
analyzed
the
history
of
the
1972
amendments
to
title
7.
it
recognized
that
congress
considered
and
rejected
proposals
to
have
an
administrative
agency...
there
it
was
the
eeoc...
exercise
what
the
court
called
primary
adjudicative
responsibility
for
title
7
cases,
subject
only
to
limited
court
review,
yet
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
to
allow
the
final
resolution
of
discrimination
claims
to
be
made
under
a
state
procedural
structure
that
is
precisely
of
the
same
kind
that
congress
rejected
for
application
in
the
federal
system,
or--
mr.
david
a.
barrett
--it
wasn't
just
the
federal
employees,
justice
brennan.
that
was
the
issue
in
chandler,
but
the
'72
amendments
as
originally
proposed
would
have
given
the
eeoc
power
to
hold
hearings
in
all
cases,
subject
to
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
the
eeoc
would
have
had
primary
enforcement
responsibility
for
private
cases
as
well.
or,
to
put
the
argument
a
little
bit
differently,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
state
legislature
apparently
believed
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
judicial
review
as
part
of
its
state
process
for
remedying
discrimination
claims.
the
decision
below,
however,
gives
the
complainants
an
unacceptable
choice.
either
they
may
participate
in
the
state
proceedings
without
invoking
the
judicial
review
that
the
legislature
thought
was
essential
as
part
of
that
process,
or
they
can
forfeit
their
right
to
a
federal
court
determination
of
their
claim,
a
right
that,
as
this
court
has
recognized
a
number
of
times,
congress
clearly
intended
them
to
have.
in
short,
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
of
title
7
that
even
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
make
any
distinction
between
state
administrative
and
state
judicial
proceedings.
it
simply
intended
in
title
7
to
allow
those
states
that
were
concerned
with
the
problem
of
employment
discrimination,
and
there
are
now
44,
incidentally,
that
have
enacted
proceedings
to
deal
with
employment
discrimination,
to
remedy
the
problem.
it
made
no
effort
to
dictate
the
particular
form
of
the
state
proceedings,
and
certainly
it
must
have
contemplated,
for
example,
because
it
mentioned
criminal
proceedings
right
in
the
statute,
that
they
would
involve
court
judgments.
yet
it
nevertheless
set
up
a
system
with
the
eeoc
and
then
the
federal
courts
to
hear
those
claims
after
the
states
had
acted
on
them.
it
makes
no
sense
in
the
context
of
such
a
scheme
to
cut
off
the
process
at
the
very
first
step.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
a.
barrett
just
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
justice
stevens'
question
concerning
section
1739,
if
you
look
at
the
operative
language
of
1738
and
1739,
it
is
identical
for
all
practical
purposes,
and
of
course
both
of
those
statutes
date
from
the
very
earliest
days
of
the
country.
they
are
very
general
procedural
statutes,
like
the
venue
statute,
for
example.
and
in
a
specific
enactment
to
deal
with
a
relatively
limited
and
specific
problem
such
as
employment
discrimination,
enacted
in
1964,
amended
in
1972,
congress
simply
acted
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
specify
the
weight
that
was
to
be
given
to
state
proceedings
that
preceded
a
title
7
proceeding
in
the
eeoc
or
in
the
federal
court.
congress
never
intended
to
force
a
litigant
to
choose
to
abandon
his
federal
remedies
by
proceeding
in
a
state.
it
wouldn't
have
set
up
this
cooperative
scheme
if
that
is
what
it
intended
to
do.
petitioner
has
been
trying
for
six
years
to
get
a
hearing
on
his
discrimination
claim.
he
has
been
thrown
out
of
court
not
for
sleeping
on
his
rights
but
for
pursuing
them
too
diligently
in
what
you
might
call
exhausting
state
remedies.
if
he
failed
to
anticipate
that
the
second
circuit
would
rule
as
it
did
in
the
sinicropi
case,
which
is
the
one
that
we
are
all
concerned
with
here,
he
was
in
good
company.
district
judge
pierce
in
a
decision
in
this
very
case
before
sinicropi
was
decided
held
that
he
was
not
precluded,
and
now
four
other
circuits,
looking
at
the
legislative
history
and
at
this
court's
decisions,
have
reached
the
same
result
as
judge
pierce.
that
is
the
proper
reading
of
a
remedial
statute
such
as
title
7,
and
it
is
the
only
result
that
is
consistent
with
the
holdings
and
the
spirit
of
this
court's
decision
in
alexander,
in
chandler
and,
i
think,
most
particularly,
in
new
york
gaslight
club,
where
the
court
looked
at
this
very
same
new
york
procedure,
clearly
saw
that
it
encompassed
judicial
review.
and
to
answer
one
final
point,
we
don't
say
that
the
employer
would
be
barred
any
more
than
the
claimant
would
be
from
litigating
in
federal
court
if
the
claimant
elects
to
pursue
his
title
7
action
there.
what
is
fair
for
one
is
fair
for
the
other,
we
think,
so
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
have
any
concern
on
that
score.
all
we
are
asking
here
is
for
the
de
novo
trial
before
a
federal
judge
that
congress
intended,
and
we
hope
that
the
court
will
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit.
thank
you.
