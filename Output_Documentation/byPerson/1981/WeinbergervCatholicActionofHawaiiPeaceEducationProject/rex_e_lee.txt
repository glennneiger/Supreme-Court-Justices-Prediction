mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
requirements
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
of
1969,
concerning
the
disclosure
of
whether
nuclear
weapons
are
or
are
not
stored
at
a
particular
site.
that
substantive
information,
the
storage
or
non
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
at
a
particular
site,
is
a
military
secret.
in
the
early
1970's,
in
response
to
the
objections
of
local
citizens
to
the
alleged
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
at
the
waikele
branch
of
the
lualualei
naval
magazine
on
the
island
of
oahu,
the
navy
considered
moving
that
storage
facility
six
miles
away
to
the
west
loch
branch
of
that
same
lualualei
naval
magazine.
the
navy
has
never
confirmed
nor
denied
that
nuclear
weapons
were
in
fact
stored
at
waikele.
in
1975,
the
navy
made
an
assessment
of
the
effect
of
that
transfer
on
the
environment,
and
in
june
of
1977
a
portion
of
that
classified
document
was
released
to
the
public
as
an
environmental
impact
assessment,
concluding
that
the
construction
of
the
48
earth
covered
magazines
and
associated
buildings
and
the
provision
of
security
for
those
buildings
would
have
no
significant
environmental
impact.
no
mention
was
made
of
nuclear
weapons
storage.
in
1978,
the
department
of
the
navy
prepared
a
candidate
or
generic
environmental
impact
statement
dealing
with
nuclear
aspects
of
naval
systems
storage.
that
candidate
statement--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
a
type
of
nepa
performance,
justice
brennan,
that
is
recognized
by
the
council
of
environmental
quality.
it
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
type
thing
that
was
done,
say,
with
respect
to
the
southwest
energy
study,
where
you
take
a
series,
a
single
prototype
that
will
be
repeated
in
a
number
of
different
instances,
such
as
the
southwest
energy
study
dealing
with
dams
along
the
colorado
river.
this
one,
by
contrast,
deals
with
a
situation
where
you
have
a
single
circumstance
that
might
be
repeated
applicable
to
a
generic
situation.
it
seemed
particularly
appropriate
in
this
instance,
given
the
secret
nature
of
storage
at
any
particular
site.
that
candidate
statement
did
conclude,
in
general...
it
is
set
forth
as
appendix
g
to
the
petition
for
certiorari...
that
the
nuclear
aspects
of
weapons
storage
do
not
constitute
an
environmental
factor
per
se,
but
it
did
not
discuss
any
issues
pertaining
to
nuclear
storage
at
any
specific
site.
this
suit
was
filed
in
march
of
1978,
alleging
that
the
west
loch
facility
would
house
nuclear
weapons,
and
seeking
to
enjoin
the
secretary
of
defense
and
various
navy
officials
from
expanding
the
facility
until
they
complied
with
nepa,
the
endangered
species
act,
and
the
national
historic
preservation
act.
the
district
court
concluded
that
none
of
those
acts
was
offended
by
the
proposed
transfer.
with
regard
to
both
the
historic
preservation
act
and
the
endangered
species
act,
the
court
relied
on
findings
that
were
made
in
the
declassified
portion
of
the
1975
assessment
that
was
released
to
the
public
as
an
environmental
impact
assessment.
with
respect
to
nepa,
the
district
judge
concluded
that
submission
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
would
conflict
with
the
security
data
provisions
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
and
also
with
the
security
classification
guides
prepared
jointly
by
the
department
of
defense
and
the
department
of
energy.
under
those
circumstances,
the
district
court
ruled
that
defendants
have
complied
with
the
national
environmental
policy
act
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
within
the
restrictions
of
the
security
classification
guides
and
the
atomic
energy
act.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
directed
the
navy
to
prepare
a
"hypothetical
environmental
impact
statement"
which
would
assess
the
potential
consequences
of
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
at
this
particular
site.
it
is
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
under
review
today.
the
issues
in
this
case
affect
two
statutes
and
three
policies.
the
primary
statute
and
the
primary
policy
are
those
of
nepa,
which
requires
federal
decision
makers
to
take
environmental
factors
into
account
in
making
their
final
judgments.
the
second
nepa
objective,
which
is
arguably
a
separate
one,
but
can
also
be
regarded
as
totally
subsumed
within
the
first,
is
to
make
certain
kinds
of
information
available
to
the
public
for
whatever
purpose
the
public
wishes
to
make
of
it.
both
of
these
objectives
contemplate
disclosure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
indeed,
justice
rehnquist,
nepa
expressly
ties
into
foia
by
its
incorporation
of
that
document
by
reference,
and
the
public
disclosure
provisions,
the
public
disclosure
language
simply
says,
disclosure
to
the
public
as
required
by
5
usc,
and
so
forth,
which
is
the
freedom
of
information
act.
on
the
face
of
things,
the
policy
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
by
contrast,
and
of
other
classification
laws,
is
the
preservation
of
secrecy
of
information
concerning
nuclear
weapons,
so
that
on
its
face
you
do
have
a
potential
tension,
and
it
is
well
settled
law
that
where
you
have
tension
between
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
another
statute,
that
it
is
nepa
that
must
yield.
but
it
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case
that
these
statutes
and
their
facially
conflicting
policies
can
be
largely
accommodated
to
a
greater
extent
than
is
true
in
the
case
of
conflict
between
the
national
environmental
policy
and
most
other
statutes.
the
key
to
this
accommodation
is
the
regulations
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
department
of
defense
that
concede...
or,
i
shouldn't
say
concede,
but
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
whether
they
would
be
required
to
have
adopted
such
regulations
or
not,
that
the
department
of
defense
regards
nepa
as
applicable
to
all
of
its
activities,
including
secret
activities,
with
the
appropriate
secrecy
protection
being
provided
by
classification
applicable
to
the
nepa
documents
themselves.
this
case
does
have
one
feature
that
complicates
it
and
that
will
not
be
present
in
most
of
these
instances
where
nepa
will
be
applicable
because
of
the
department
of
defense
regulations
to
classified
activities
of
the
military,
and
the
feature
of
this
case
that
distinguishes
it
is
this.
the
secret
is
whether
nuclear
weapons
are
or
are
not
being
stored
at
a
specific
site.
therefore,
one
of
the
things
that
cannot
be
disclosed
is
whether
environmental
considerations
pertaining
to
nuclear
storage
at
that
site
have
or
have
not
been
considered
by
the
decision
makers,
because
to
reveal
that
fact
would
reveal
the
secret
itself.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that
the
basic
approach
that
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
was
a
middle
ground,
and
the
attempt
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
say,
well,
assume
that
they
might
be
stored
there;
then
what
would
be
the
consequences?
the
drawbacks
of
that
are
that
inevitably
that
does
lead
to
the
disclosure
of
other
information
that
is
classified.
you
sacrifice,
mr.
chief
justice,
either
the
adequacy
of
the
statement,
or
you
sacrifice
the
information,
because
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
statement
which
really
calls
to
the
attention
of
the
decision
makers
what
the
real
risks
are
here,
you
have
to
discuss
things
like,
what
kind
of
weapons
will
they
be,
what
is
their
potential,
and
if
there
are
to
be
environmental
consequences,
that
depends
on
such
things
as
the
amount
of
fissionable
material,
the
quality
of
the
material,
the
security...
the
safeguards,
the
security,
and
so
forth.
much
better
approach.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
not
a
secret.
the
reason
that
it
is
not
a
secret
is
because
the
type
of
fencing
that
necessarily
surrounds,
necessarily
accompanies
a
nuclear
capable
facility
simply
cannot
be
disguised.
but
nuclear
capability
is
not
a
secret;
storage
at
a
particular
facility
is.
that
brings
me
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
principle
that
governs
the
resolution
of
this
case,
and
it
is
a
rather
simple
one.
the
key,
as
i
say,
is
the
existence
of
this
department
of
defense
regulation.
if
there
is
in
fact
no
nuclear
storage
at
west
loch,
then
the
fears
posited
by
the
respondents
are,
of
course,
groundless.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
west
loch
is
or
is
to
be
a
nuclear
storage
facility,
then
consistent
with
department
of
defense
regulations,
the
environmental
consequences
have
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
decision
maker,
and
they
have
been
taken
into
account
by
them.
the
only
problem
is
that
that
fact,
whether
or
not
the
appropriate
nepa
document
has
been
prepared
and
has
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
decision
makers,
is
the
very
fact
that
cannot
be
disclosed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
that
would
contemplate
public
disclosure,
and
that
is
the
part
that
must...
that
must
yield,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
really
am
not
certain.
the
public
disclosure
aspects
of
it,
the
public
disclosure
aspects
of
it
are
limited
by
the
same
limitation
as
the
freedom
of
information
act.
it
is
not
simply
that
you
can't
disclose
it
through
freedom
of
information
act
purposes.
it
is
that
disclosure
to
the
public
has
the
same
limitation
as
does
disclosure
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
purposes
of
filing
it
with
the
council
on
environmental
quality
is
for
purposes
of
public
disclosure,
but
what
does
happen...
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
but
what
does
happen...
what
does
happen
is
that
that
classified
document,
whose
very
existence
must
necessarily
remain
a
secret,
is
made
available
to
the
decision
makers
who...
those
who
are
ultimately
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
will
be
nuclear
storage
at
the
west
loch
facility
or
any
other
specific--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
am
not
enough
of
an
expert
on
those
kinds
of
matters
to
know
whether
it
would
satisfy
it
or
not,
but
that
question
once
again,
i
think,
contains
the
key
to
the
solution
of
this
case
for
that
reason.
i
can
make
an
argument
that
that
generic
statement,
concluding,
as
it
does,
that
there
are
no
substantial
risks
from
nuclear
storage
per
se,
together
with
the
environmental
impact
assessment
that
was
done
pertaining
to
this
particular
facility,
would
be
sufficient,
but
it
is
neither
my
background
nor
my
training
to
know
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
totality
of
environmental
document
performance.
but
those
who
are
directing
these
kinds
of
matters,
whose
stewardship
those
kinds
of
matters
fall
within,
do
have
that
within
their
sphere
of
expertise,
and
in
the
event
that
the
conclusion...
that
there
is
a
conclusion
that
these
are
not
sufficient,
then
the
regulations
require
that
additional
documents
be
prepared
and
filed.
and
nepa
really
requires
no
more,
and
this,
i
think,
is
a
crucial
point.
with
regard
to
environmental
considerations
being
taken
into
effect,
they
are,
the
regulations
required,
and
with
respect
to
public
disclosure,
nepa
expressly
exempts
from
public
dissemination,
through
its
incorporation
by
reference
of
the
public
disclosure
provisions
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
dissemination
of
classified
information.
really,
this
also
answers
the
motivating
concerns
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals'
very
proper
concern,
which
led
to
what
we
conclude
was
clearly
an
improper
kind
of
approach,
was
that
the
public
has
to
receive
some
assurance
that
when
the
decision
is
made,
the
decision
maker
will
have
been
adequately
informed
as
to
the
environmental
consequences
of
each
alternative,
and
the
department
of
defense
regulations
give
that
assurance.
the
respondents
contend
that
there
is
no
difference
between
asking
the
hypothetical
question,
well,
what
would
be
the
possible
environmental
consequences
if
a
freeway
exchange
were
built
in
a
particular
location,
and
a
hypothetical
which
asks,
what
would
be
the
possible
environmental
consequences
if
nuclear
capable
storage
bunkers
were
built
in
a
particular
location.
well,
the
question
whether
nuclear
capable
storage
bunkers
are
built
is
not
the
question
that
poses
the
issue.
it
is
whether
in
fact
those
nuclear
capable
facilities
do
have
nuclear
warheads
stored
within
them,
but
the
real
difference--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
is
either.
i
think--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
i
think
my
statement
was
inaccurate.
there
is
a
duty,
but
the
point
is
that
the
department
of
defense
regulations
simply
state
that
to
whatever
extent
nepa
is
applicable,
it
is
not
rendered
inapplicable
because
of
the
presence
of
classified
information,
of
secrets.
the
obvious
difference
between
a
hypothetical
discussion
of
what
would
happen
if
nuclear
weapons
were
stored
in
a
particular
site
and
what
would
happen
if
a
highway
were
built
in
a
particular
place
is
that
whether
a
highway
does
or
does
not
exist
in
a
particular
location
is
not
a
military
secret.
it
may
well
be
that
the
real
complaint,
and
a
complaint
raised
in
a
different
form,
a
perfectly
legitimate
one,
is
whether
that
kind
of
information
really
should
be
secret
or
not.
i
am
sure
that
lively
debate
could
be
generated
on
that
issue,
but
it
is
totally
beside
the
point,
because
the
ultimate
right
of
decision
on
that
issue
is
vested
with
those
who
have
the
responsibility
over
the
safeguarding
of
nuclear
secrets,
and
those
same
people
have
assured
that
nepa
applies
even
where
classified
information
is
involved.
one
means
of
safeguarding,
preventing
intrusion
into
governmental
secrets
in
lawsuits
that
by
their
nature
present
the
potential
for
intrusion
into
military
secrets,
is
for
the
courts
simply
not
to
entertain
those
lawsuits
at
all,
and
there
is
a
precedent
coming
out
of
this
court
that
holds
that
such
suits
are
not
justiciable.
it
is
a
century
old,
totten
versus
the
united
states,
dealing
with
a
suit
by
a
spy
allegedly
hired
by
president
lincoln
to
spy
during
the
civil
war,
and
this
court
held
that
that
kind
of
suit
is
not
justiciable,
the
rationale
being
that
public
policy
forbids
the
maintenance
of
any
suit
the
trial
of
which
would
inevitably
lead
to
disclosure
of
matters
which
the
law
itself
regards
as
confidential.
totten
is
still
good
law.
it
was
cited
with
approval
in
united
states
versus
reynolds,
and
it
has
been
relied
upon
as
the
source
of
two
holdings
coming
out
of
the
court
of
claims
within
just
recent
months,
and
it
would
be
dispositive
of
this
case.
fortunately,
however,
the
court
need
not
resolve
this
case
on
the
totten
ground,
and
the
reason,
once
again,
is
that
the
department
of
defense
regulations
make
available
another
procedure
that
permits
this
information
to
remain
secret.
i
will
reserve
some
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
government
takes
no
position
on
that,
justice
o'connor.
you
are
quite
right.
and
the
reason
that
we
take
no
position
on
it
is
simply
that
if...
if
the
district
court
is
correct,
then
of
course
what
that
means
is
that
an
environmental
impact
statement,
as
opposed
to
an
environmental
impact
assessment,
is
what
is
required.
parenthetically,
i
will
say
once
again,
referring
back
to
justice
brennan's
earlier
question,
this
is
also...
an
environmental
impact
assessment
is
also
a
document
that
is
recognized
as
appropriate
by
ceq.
the
difference
between
an
environmental
impact
assessment
and
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
not
always
a
clean,
right
one,
but
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
will
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in...
in
determining
the
extent
of
the
document
that
is
to
be
prepared
and
filed
in
accordance
with
department
of
defense
regulations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
we
have
not
appealed
from
that
aspect
of...
of
the
district
judge's
holding,
and
all
i
am
really
saying
is
that
if
it
is
a
major
federal
action,
that
it
is
an
environmental
impact
statement
that
will
have
to
be
filed.
if
it
is
not,
then
it
is
an
environmental
impact
assessment
that
will
have
to
be
filed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
'here--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
your
statement
is
accurate,
justice
stevens.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
document
that
would
bear
the
label,
environmental
impact
statement,
would
be
prepared.
in
fact,
the
difference
between
those
two
as
often,
as
i
say,
not
a
fine,
bright
one,
and
your
question
does
point
out
one
of
the...
one
of
the
problems
with
this
kind
of
approach,
which
is
that
there
will
be
instances,
there
will
be
instances
in
which
the
public
will
not
have
the
total
information
that
was
available
to
the
decision
makers
as
they
made
their
final
judgment
on
these
issues.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
they
have
regulations,
and
i
would
assume...
i
frankly
have
never
asked
that
question
of
these
people,
but
from
the
fact
that
there
was
in
1975
a
document
as
to
whose
total
content
we
are
not
aware,
that
was
prepared
and
submitted,
and
then
a
portion
of
it
later
was
released
as
an
environmental
impact
assessment.
certainly,
the
inference
is
not
only
there,
it
is
compelled
that
some
kind
of
nepa
performance
was
required,
and
i
suppose
that
the
most
logical
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
is
that
they
did
consider
it
to
be
major
federal
action,
although
i
don't
know
that
for
a
certainty.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
what
the
regulations
require,
what
the
regulations
require
is
compliance
with
nepa.
now,
one
of
the...
but
nepa
can
be
complied
with
by
preparing
a
document
whose
purpose
is
to
inquire
whether
the
particular
action
is
major
federal
action
having
a
substantial
effect
on
the
environment,
and
in
the
event
that
the
conclusion
is
no,
that
it
is
not,
then
it
is
labeled
an
environmental
impact
assessment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that
is
a
correct
statement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
has
to
be.
it
has
to
be,
because
we
haven't...
we
haven't
appealed
from
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
not.
it
could
not
be
kept--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
the
distinction
between
the
proposal
to
build
those
that
are
nuclear
capable,
that
can't
be
kept
a
secret
because
of
the
fences,
and
how
it
in
fact
proposes
to
use
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
record
does
not
show
that.
and
may
i
just
add
one
brief
point
that
will,
i
hope,
clarify
a
bit
my
closing
comments
with
regard
to
what
the
district
judge
found
with
regard
to
major
federal
action?
the
correct
statement,
i
believe,
is
as
follows.
we
do
not
take
the
position,
as
we
stated
in
the
reply
brief,
as
to
whether
this
is
or
is
not
major
federal
action.
now,
when
the
decision
makers
face
this
issue
of
the
adequacy
of
the
environmental
document
that
is
submitted
to
them
as
it
is
required
to
be
submitted
by
the
regulations,
that
is
an
issue
that
they
will
have
to
resolve.
they
will
start
from
the
premise
that
the
district
judge
so
found,
so
determined,
but
i
believe
that
that
determination
is
not
binding
on
us
because
of
the
fact
that
we
won
before
the
district
court
and
therefore
we
are
under
no
obligation
to
appeal,
and
also
because
his
finding,
as
you
re
read
it,
was
construction
and
use,
and
what
we
have
what
does
remain
a
secret
is
how
these
facilities
are
used,
and
must
remain
a
secret,
and
that
brings
me--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
have
simply
reaffirmed
the
position
that
i
was
taking.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
our
position
is
that
it
may
be,
it
may
not
be,
but
that
that
is
an
issue
that
we
took...
that
the
decision
makers
are
going
to
have
to
take
into
account,
the
same
as
anyone
else
takes
it
into
account,
at
the
time
they
decide
whether
what
is
required
is
an
environmental
impact
assessment
or
statement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
what
we
do
know
is
that
they
are
required,
that
they
are
required
by
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
and
that
they
are
required
in
a
case
like
this
at
least
to
do
an
environmental
impact
assessment
that
makes
the
preliminary
inquiry
whether
or
not
it
is
a
major
federal
action,
and
that
they
are
required
to
do
by
the
ceq
guidelines,
which
in
turn
are
incorporated
by
reference
through
the
department
of
defense
regulations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
don't
know
if
it
is
correct
to
say
they
do
not
know.
we
do
not
concede
for
purposes
of
this
litigation,
because
i
think
we
don't
need
to,
that
it
is.
we
took
the
position
before
the
district
court
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
don't
think--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
am
perfectly
willing
to
have
you
decide
the
case--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
that
even
if
it
is,
that
it
has
been
satisfied.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
only
thing
that
i
am
saying
is
that
since
we
won
before
the
district
court,
it
is
not
technically
binding
on
us
in
that
sense.
let
me
come
now
to
what
i
believe
is
the
point
that
ought
to
govern
the
final
disposition
of
this
case,
and
it
comes
out
of
the
exchange
about
whether
the
very
existence
of
the
environmental
impact
statement
must
be
kept
secret.
there
is
no
question
that
that
information
is
classified.
the
sources
of
it
are
set
forth
at
page
16
of
our
brief,
and
that
is
a
military
secret.
now,
if
you
reveal
the
fact
that
whatever
document,
environmental
impact
assessment,
environmental
impact
statement,
or
whatever,
has
discussed
that
issue,
then
you
reveal
the
secret.
this
case
is
distinct...
indeed,
it
may
be
unique...
in
that
respect.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
but
what
you
would
not
want
to
do,
justice
stevens,
is
prepare
something
that
was
an
environmental
impact
statement
that
called
to
the
attention...
and
make
public
the
fact
that
it
was
an
environmental
impact
statement
that
called
to
the
attention
of
the
decision
makers
that
there
were
nuclear
weapons
to
be
stored
there.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
in
any
event,
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
case,
as
in
others,
you
come
down
finally
to
a
distinction
between
making
the
disclosure
to
the
decision
makers
and
the
adequacy
of
the
final
judgment
and
the
adequacy
of
the
alternatives
that
are
taken
into
account.
if
you
did
disclose
publicly
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
or
whatever
nepa
document
had
been
disclosed
or
had
been
made,
then
you
do
disclose
the
very
secret
at
issue,
which
is
whether
nuclear
weapons
are
to
be
stored
at
that
particular
facility.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
do
rely
on
it,
in
rejecting...
there
are
several
approaches
that
can
be
taken.
we
rely
on
that,
in
rejecting
the
approach
that
the
court
of
appeals
took,
which
was
for
a
hypothetical
environmental
statement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
the
problem
with
that
hypothetical
environmental
statement
is
that
it
necessarily
reveals
too
much,
or
it
necessarily
leads
into
these
kinds
of
statements.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
if
you
could
have
publicly
available,
as
indeed
we
do,
because
there
was
a
classified
statement
that
was
prepared
in
1975,
that
something
was
done.
what
you
cannot
do
is
get
any
assurance
that
what
was
disclosed
in
that
was
the...
that
what
was
disclosed
in
that
is
that
nuclear
weapons
would
be
stored
there,
or
that
the
environmental
consequences
were
called
to
the
attention--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
fence
does
tell
you
that
it
is
nuclear
capable.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
that
it
is
possible.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
making
it
public.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
making
the
environmental
impact
statement
public.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
are
several
secrets
in
this
case,
and
one
of
them--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and
one
of
them,
of
course,
is
the
nature
of
the
weapons,
the
security,
and
so
forth,
but
in
addition
there
is
a
problem
merely
with
disclosing
the
fact
that
these
factors
have
been
taken
into
account
or
have
not,
because
that
implies
that
there
may
be
storage--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
would
prefer
an
in
camera
review.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
we
would
prefer
an
in
camera
review
procedure
to
the
kind
of
approach
that
was
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
that
kind
of--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
you
do
have
the
threshold
inquiries
about
the
adequacy
of
the
procedure
that
has
been
followed.
those
would
be...
those
could
be
subject
to
in
camera
review
but
we
think
that
the
risks
of
disclosure
are
sufficiently
great
that,
particularly
with
adversary
type
proceedings,
the
need
for
appeal,
and
so
forth.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely
not.
what
i
have
said
here
today
is
that
the
risks
that
are
attendant
upon
the
court
of
appeals
view
are
the
risks
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
but
that
in
addition,
there
is
the
problem
that
is
also
discussed
in
our
reply
brief,
that
the
mere
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
an
environmental
statement
has
been
prepared
may
also
disclose
the
secret
at
issue.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
