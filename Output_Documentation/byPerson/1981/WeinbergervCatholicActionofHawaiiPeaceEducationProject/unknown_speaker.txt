solicitor
general--
unknown
speaker
--"#
candidate",
is
that
a
word
of
art
or
something?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
nepa
is
much
like
foia
in
the
second
regard,
then?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
mr.
solicitor
general,
or
i
will
put
it
this
way:
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
the
hypothetical
was,
yes,
we
are
storing
nuclear
weapons
of
the
highest
power
at
this
site,
hypothetically?
unknown
speaker
would
the
inference
be
drawn
from
that,
then,
then
you
musn't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
be
a
military
secret
that
a
particular
facility
was
capable
of
storage?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
would
it
be
the
government's
position,
then,
under
the
department
of
defense
regulations,
that
if
indeed
storage
at
a
particular
site
were
contemplated,
that
the
department
of
defense
would
have
prepared
a
specific
environmental
impact
statement
which
would
have
been
given
to
the
president
and
the
council
on
environmental
quality?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
information
would
not
be
available
to
the
public,
but
how
about
to
the
council
on
environmental
quality?
unknown
speaker
i
was
not
sure
how
to
interpret
that,
and
that
is
why
i
wanted
your
views.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
your
position
that
the
generic
statement
which
was
prepared
would
satisfy
the
requirements.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
really
precisely
the
question,
or
is
it
a
question
of
whether
it
has
been
proposed
that
there
be
such
storage?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
not
a
duty
to
prepare
the
statement
when
a
proposal
is
made?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee--
unknown
speaker
--before
you
sit
down,
the
trial
court
found
the
placing
of
nuclear
weapons
near
a
major
population
center
to
be
a
major
federal
action
for
purposes
of
nepa.
does
the
government
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
i
am
puzzled
now.
if
the
government
takes
no
position
on
whether
or
not
the
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
in
this
facility
would
be
a
major
federal
action,
how
can
we
know
what
the
government's
position
would
be
with
respect
to
preparation
of
documents
if
a
proposal
to
store
such
weapons
were
made?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
isn't
that
conceivably
an
issue
on
which
reasonable
men
could
differ?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
and
supposing
judges
have
a
different
view
than
the
department
of
defense
has?
and
then
there
is
just
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
statement
would
in
fact
be
prepared.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
the
department
of
defense
has
a
different
view
than
the
district
judge
has.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
i
am
not
concerned
about,
at
this
point...
the
thrust
of
my
question
is
not
what
becomes
public
information,
but
rather
what
is
known
to
the
decision
maker
at
the
time
he
acts
on
a
proposal,
because
if
it
is
the
view
of
the
department
of
defense
that
the
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
near
a
population
center
or
in
this
particular
facility
is
not
in
any
event
a
major
federal
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
they
have
no
duty
to
prepare
anything,
no
statutory
duty
to
prepare
anything.
well,
they
have
regulations,
though.
unknown
speaker
don't
the
regulations
require--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
didn't
appeal
the
finding
of
a
major
federal
action,
then
we
must
judge
this
case
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
major
federal
action,
and
so
must
the
department
of
defense
comport
itself.
it
is
bound
by
the
judgment,
and
so
it
must
have...
you
are
submitting
that...
you
say,
assuming
this
is
a
major
federal
action,
all
of
the
requirements
of
nepa
have
been
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you
have
really
changed
your
position
a
little
bit.
unknown
speaker
because
you
originally
said,
the
united
states
takes
no
position
on
whether
it
is
major
federal
action.
now
i
think
you
are
saying
that
the
district
court
has
held
it
is
major
federal
action,
and
that
is
a
correct
view
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
ms.
stearns,
may
i
interrupt?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
precisely
what
you
are
saying.
they
said,
it
is
not
environmentally
controversial.
by
that
do
you
mean
the
construction
of
the
facility
as
described
in
the
papers,
or
the
storage
of
nuclear
weapons?
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
agree
that
their
testimony
would
be
entirely
accurate
if
they
have
no
intention
whatsoever
of
ever
storing
nuclear
weapons
there?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
you
have
answered
my
question.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
if
there
never
is
an
intention
or
never
was
an
intention
to
actually
store
nuclear
weapons
there?
would
they
have
prepared
and
filed
all
the
necessary
documents?
unknown
speaker
you
are
absolutely
positive,
for
the
purpose
of
my
question.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
don't
challenge
them
on
that
hypothesis.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
don't
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
their
documents
on
the
hypothesis
that
they
never
intend
to
store
nuclear
weapons
there.
unknown
speaker
they
will
never
propose
it.
the
proposal
is
what
triggers
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is,
assuming
they
have
decided
that
they
are
purely
a
decoy,
they
are
never
going
to
put
actual
nuclear
weapons
there,
then
do
you
question
the
adequacy
of
the
documents
on
that
hypothesis?
unknown
speaker
is
the
navy
obliged
to
tell
you
every
place
they
have
nuclear
weapons?
unknown
speaker
if
so,
then
russia
will
save
a
whole
lot
of
money.
i
mean,
spy
money.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
you
know.
i
don't.
unknown
speaker
i
said,
maybe
you
know.
i
don't.
unknown
speaker
but
i
still
want
to
know
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
your
position
that
the
navy
has
to
tell
you
that
there
are
nuclear
weapons
there.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you
to
say
you
can't
store
conventional
weapons
in
a
nuclear
bunker?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
me.
i
think
you
could
store
trucks
in
there.
unknown
speaker
beds.
kitchen
material.
you
can
store
anything
in
a
bunker.
unknown
speaker
but
could
we
have
a
nuclear
bunker
with
nothing
in
it,
with
air?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
really
want
the
navy
to
tell
you
where
their
bunkers
are.
unknown
speaker
that
you
think
as
a
citizen
you
have
that
right.
unknown
speaker
ms.
stearns,
may
i
ask,
the
words
"capability"
and
"capable"
have
been
used
quite
a
bit.
is
there
any
definition
of
a
bunker
that
has
the
capacity
or
capability
of
accommodating
nuclear
weapons?
unknown
speaker
nuclear
weapons
certainly
are
not
fungible.
i
would
assume
that
there
must
be
a
wide
variety
of
storage
facilities.
i
wonder
also
whether
we
are
talking
about
just
a
few
bases
or
hundreds
of
bases.
i
assume
airplanes
with
nuclear
weapons
aboard
fly
in
and
out
of
air
bases
all
over
the
united
states
from
time
to
time.
submarines
with
nuclear
weapons
come
into
ports.
are
the
weapons
stored
there?
i
haven't
read
the
record,
but
i
was
wondering
whether
the
record
indicates
the
magnitude
of
this
problem,
and
whether
or
not
one
knows
whether
a
particular
bunker
will
accommodate
a
small
nuclear
weapon
that
a
fighter
plane
could
carry,
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
some
permanent
storage
of
a
significant
volume
of
these
weapons.
unknown
speaker
ms.
stearns,
what
if
the
government
had
filed
an
eis
saying,
yes,
we
do
plan
to
store
nuclear
weapons
here,
and
they
are
of
such
and
such
magnitude,
and
fully
describe
them?
would
that
have
prevented
them
from
going
ahead
with
the
action?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
ms.
stearns,
which
is
the
more
informative,
the
candidate
or
the
assessment?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
the
defects
that
you
are
pointing
out
would
not
appear
in
a
statement
itself.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
stored
one
in
death
valley,
where
the
little
fish
is
that
the
chief
justice's
opinion
wrote
about,
you
might
endanger
only
the
little
fish
under
the
historic
preservation
act,
or
the
endangered
species
act,
and
nonetheless
be
just
as
much
in
violation
of
the
nepa
provisions
as
if
you
were
talking
about
a
major
airport
and
a
major
flight
route.
unknown
speaker
does
it
appear
in
this
record
whether
or
not
nuclear
bombs
can
be
ignited
or
triggered
by
any
kind
of
impact?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
my
question.
that
isn't
my
question.
is
your
answer
no,
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
different
question.
you
have
said
that
if
you
were
talking
about
this
bunker
as
just
a
non
nuclear
storage,
that
the
adequacy
of
the
statement
here
has
not
been
tried
out,
and
you
would
have
to
have
a
remand.
my
question
to
you
is,
does
the
record
sustain
one
way
or
another
whether
an
airplane
crash
crashing
into
this
bunker
could
detonate
a
nuclear
bomb.
unknown
speaker
but
ms.
stearns,
all
this...
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
one
could
believe
that
if
the
magazine
blows
up,
the
entire
island
will
be
demolished.
nevertheless,
if
the
navy
prepares
the
right
documents,
they
could
still
store
the
stuff
there.
they
could
decide
that
is
a
risk
worth
taking.
we
are
not
really
interested
in
that.
we
are
just
interested
in
what
they
must
prepare
and
file.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
to
prevent
them
from
doing
so.
unknown
speaker
they
could
say
there
is
one
chance
in
1,642,000
and
so
forth
that
the
thing
will
blow
up,
and
if
it
does
blow
up,
the
whole
island
goes.
they
could
still
store
the
stuff
there.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
real
question
here
is
whether
the
statute
has
been
triggered
by
a
proposal.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
just
building
the
facility
is
a
sufficient
proposal.
they
don't
have
to
propose
actually
to
store
the
material
there.
unknown
speaker
ms.
stearns,
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
even
the
existence
of
a
classified
environmental
impact
statement
has
to
be
kept
secret
by
virtue
of
the
other
legislation,
then
what
relief
would
you
propose?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
want
to
press
you
a
little
bit
as
to
what
you
are
specifically
proposing
in
the
event
the
court
should
determine
that
even
the
existence
of
the
eis
has
to
be
kept
secret.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
counsel,
that
litigants
such
as
the
litigant
you
represent
could
bring
a
lawsuit
and
have
the
courts
tell
the
navy
to
designate
and
reveal
all
the
ports
of
the
united
states
into
which
submarines
carrying
nuclear
weapons
come
for
supplies
or
come
for
any
other
purpose?
unknown
speaker
the
assumption
there
is
that
a
submarine
bearing
nuclear
weapons
coming
into
the
port
of
new
york
or
san
francisco
would
produce
a
comparable
risk
that
you
raise
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
kind
of
action
would
it
be?
who
controls
the
submarines
and
the
aircraft
which
carry
nuclear
weapons?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
government
planned
to
build
a
brand
new
slip
which
would
accommodate
a
nuclear
submarine,
but
which
could
accommodate
other
naval
vessels,
too?
would
that
be
major
federal
action?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
why
not,
though,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
transportation
of
huge
quantities
of
nuclear
weapons
might
be
more
hazardous
than
their
storage
in
one
place.
unknown
speaker
most
of
your
harbors
are
near
large
population
centers,
and
most
of
your
big
airports
are,
too.
you
keep
talking
about
airplane
crashes.
what
about
beside
some
of
the
highways
i
have
driven
on?
there
are
many
more
accidents
than
airplane
accidents.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
what
worries
me
about
this.
you
say
you
can
predict
how
many
airplanes
are
going
to
crash.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
you
could.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
when
the
navy
wants
to
decide
where
they
are
going
to
put
their
weapons,
they
have
to
draw
arcs
to
find
out
how
many
airplanes
have
crashed?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
i
am
glad
you
don't
handle
the
war.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
before
you
commence,
this
has
been
discussed
before,
but
i
am
not
clear
on
it.
the
district
judge
found
that
the
storage
facilities
in
question
are
capable
of
accommodating
nuclear
weapons.
does
the
government
regard
that
as
secret
information?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not?
unknown
speaker
my
question
really
gets
back
as
to
what
the
government
proposes
to
do--
unknown
speaker
--with
respect
to
putting
weapons
in
or
not.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
in
this
case
show
how
many
places,
locations
in
the
united
states
are
capable
of
storing
nuclear
weapons?
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
that,
because
i
think
you
have
changed
your
position
again,
if
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
what
is
your
position
on
the
question
whether
the
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
in
this
facility
would
be
major
federal
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
you
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
so
we
can
be
sure
that
if
the
department
of
defense
has
a
regulation
requiring
preparation
of
a
statement
whenever
major
federal
action
takes
place,
we
don't
know
whether
they
will
file
such
a
paper
or
not.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
how
they
read
the
regulation,
what
they
think
a
major
federal
action
is.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
it
all
boils
down
to
is,
the
united
states
does
not
know
whether
or
not
the
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
in
this
facility
would
be
a
major
federal
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
say
that
i
think
your
position
would
be
much
stronger
if
you
did
concede
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
you
bound
by--
unknown
speaker
--doesn't
this
case
come
here
on
the...
as
far
as
we...
shouldn't
we
judge
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
finding
in
this
case
stands,
that
this
is
major
federal
action?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
even
if
it
is,
you
have
satisfied
everything
that
is
required.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
judging
this
case,
not
a
lot
of
others
that
haven't
come
up
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
i
am
not
even
sure
that
is
right,
because
the
statute
is
triggered
by
a
proposal,
and
you
conceivably,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
is
the
right
view
of
the
case--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
could
conceivably
be
under
an
obligation
to
prepare
a
statement,
even
disclose
it
whenever
a
proposal
is
made.
that
would
not
reveal
whether
or
not
action
was
taken
on
the
proposal.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
that
is
going
farther
than
you
have
to.
all
you
would
have
to
disclose
is
that
a
proposal
has
been
made
to
store
weapons
there.
that
is
what
triggers
the
statement.
it
is
not
the
actual
storage.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
distinction
between
building
a
nuclear
capable
facility
and
making
a
proposal
to
store
something
there
may
not
necessarily
be
the
difference
between
secrecy
and
no
secrecy.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lee,
it
seems
you
don't
rely,
then...
i
seem
to
have
had
a
different
view
from
your
brief.
you
really
don't
rely
on
what
you
might
have
to
disclose
in
addition
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
likelihood
of
nuclear
weapons
being
stored
here,
namely,
information
about
the
weapons.
if
you
were
going
to
really
make
an
assessment,
you
would
have
to
know
an
awful
lot
about
the
weapons.
unknown
speaker
and
what
their
effect
is.
now,
do
you
rely
on
that
at
all?
it
doesn't
sound
like
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
proposal
that
justice
stevens
spoke
of,
if
you
are
just
going
to...
you
are
thinking
about
maybe
storing
weapons
here,
and
you
have
to
have
an
environmental
impact
statement.
now,
you
say,
if
you
said
you
had
to
have
one,
then
you
would
have
to
reveal
secret
information
about
the
weapons?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
is
possible...
can't
you
disclose...
are
you
disclosing
any
more
than
what
you
have
already
disclosed
by
your
fence,
that
it
is
a
possibility
that
nuclear
weapons
will
be
stored
here
some
time
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
the
fence
tells
you.
it
tells
you
at
least
that,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
it
is
possible.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
now,
that
much.
why
isn't
that
a...
why
doesn't
that
trigger
the
requirement
of
an
environmental
impact
statement?
if
it
does,
then
what
is
your
objection?
your
objection
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
making
what
public,
the
possibility?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
you
object
to
that
because
of
what
it
tells
you
about
the
weapons.
unknown
speaker
in
your
original
argument
you
said,
the
secret
in
this
case
is
so
and
so.
you
didn't
say
the
secret
in
this
case
is
the
characteristics
of
the
weapons.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you've
got
a
different
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
get
to
the
question,
then,
suppose
the
case
turns
on
whether
or
not
what
you
would
disclose
in
the
environmental
impact
statement
is
secret,
and
if
it
is,
whether
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
what
would
you...
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
said,
well,
even
if
it
is
secret
material
in
the
environmental
impact
statement,
it
should
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
with
in
camera
hearings
and
so
on.
i
take
it
you
didn't
want
to
get
into
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
you
would
prefer,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
is
it
your
position
that
if
it
is
secret,
if
what
would
be
in
the
environmental
impact
statement
is
secret,
that
that
is
the
end
of
it,
and
that
it
should
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
your
argument
today
is
consistent
with
your
brief,
and
you
don't
disavow
anything
in
your
brief?
