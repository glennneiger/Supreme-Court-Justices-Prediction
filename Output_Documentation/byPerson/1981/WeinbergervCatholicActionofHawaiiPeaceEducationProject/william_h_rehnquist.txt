weinberger
versus
catholic
action
of
hawaii
peace
education
project,
the
relationship
between
nepa
and
foia
freedom
information
act
does
involve.
in
1977,
the
navy
decided
to
construct
new
facilities
near
the
honolulu
international
airport
that
would
be
capable
of
storing
nuclear
weapons.
respondent
filed
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
hawaii,
asking
the
court
to
require
the
navy
to
prepare
and
disclose
to
the
public
environmental
impacts
statement
discussing
the
risk
of
nuclear
accident
resulting
from
the
proximity
of
the
new
facilities
to
the
airport
and
the
effects
such
an
accident
would
have
on
the
environment
and
populace
of
hawaii.
the
navy's
regulations
permitted
either
to
admit
nor
deny
whether
nuclear
weapons
are
actually
stored
at
this
facility.
the
navy
however
has
prepared
and
disclosed
documents
to
deal
generally
with
the
environmental
effects
of
storing
nuclear
weapons.
on
appeal
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
balance
the
publics
need
for
information
concerning
the
environment
with
the
navys
need
for
secrecy,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
invented
the
hypothetical
environmental
impact
statement
whereby
the
navy
would
hypothesize
without
specifying
the
nuclear
weapons
were
stored
at
the
new
facility.
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
is
reversed.
the
national
environmental
policy
act
in
no
way
requires
the
navy
to
prepare
and
disclose
such
as
statement.
the
public
disclosure
requirements
of
nepa
are
governed
by
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
act
in
turn
does
not
require
the
navy
to
release
any
documents
containing
classified
information
neither
does
it
require
the
navy
to
prepare
a
document
nowhere
mentioned
in
nepa.
if
the
navy
proposes
to
store
nuclear
weapons
on
it's
new
hawaii
facilities,
its
regulations
can
be
read
however
to
require
to
prepare
a
statement
solely
for
internal
purposes
even
if
such
a
document
cannot
be
disclosed
to
the
public.
the
navy
however
is
not
required
by
nepa
to
prepare
a
statement
simply
because
of
new
facilities
are
capable
of
storing
nuclear
weapons,
but
only
at
the
point
when
the
navy
actually
proposes
to
store
weapons
there.
since
by
law,
the
navy
can
either
admit
doing
that
or
deny
that
--
it
proposes
to
store
nuclear
weapons
there.
it
has
not
been
and
cannot
be
established
whether
the
navy
has
proposed
the
only
action
that
would
require
the
preparation
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
dealing
with
the
consequences
of
storing
weapons
at
the
new
facilities.
justice
blackmun
joined
by
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
