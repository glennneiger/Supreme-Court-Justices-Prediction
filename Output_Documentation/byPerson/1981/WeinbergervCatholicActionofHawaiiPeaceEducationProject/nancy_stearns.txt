ms.
nancy
stearns
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
before
this
court
can
be
simply
put:
is
it
lawful
under
the
national
environmental
policy
act
for
the
navy
to
propose
to
build
nuclear
capable
weapons
storage
bunkers
in
close
proximity
to
three
airports
without
ever
examining
the
various
possible
consequences
of
that
proposed
action,
particularly
where
one
such
consequence
could
be
an
airplane
crash
which
could
lead
to
an
accidental
explosion
which
would
render
downtown
honolulu
or
its
fast
growing
suburbs
uninhabitable?
the
question
is
not,
as
petitioners
have
suggested,
either
whether
or
not
nuclear
weapons
are
presently
in
the
west
loch
bunkers;
it
is
also
not,
as
petitioners
have
also
suggested,
whether
or
not
nepa
requires
revelation
of
military
secrets
in
a
publicly
available
eis.
recently
in
their
reply
brief,
and
again
here
today,
the
petitioners
have
suggested
something
else,
which
is
that
they
have
in
fact
complied
with
nepa.
i
think
that
it
would
be
useful
to
rid
ourselves
of
that
possibility
from
the
very
beginning.
petitioner's
own
environmental
impact
assessment,
which
did
not
discuss
the
possibility
of
nuclear
weapons
being
stored
at
west
loch,
but
considered
questions
relating
to
the
storage
of
conventional
weapons,
itself
concluded,
and
i
quote,
"it
is
concluded
that
the
project
will
have
no
significant
effect
on
the
environment,
and
will
not
be
environmentally
controversial.
"
"preparation
of
a
candidate
environmental
impact
statement.
"
--excuse
me...
yes,
"preparation
of
a
candidate
environmental
impact
statement
is
therefore
not
considered
required.
"
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
several
of
their
witnesses
reiterated
that
this
was
not
major
federal
action,
it
was
not
environmentally
controversial,
therefore
the
eia
was
all
that
was
necessary.
their
own
classification--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--they
do
not
specifically
discuss
the
storage
of
nuclear
weapons
in
this
document,
in
the
environmental
impact
assessment.
that
is
one
of
our
concerns.
ms.
nancy
stearns
your
honor,
i
can
only
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
which
said
that
as
long
as
they
are
building
nuclear
capable
bunkers,
one
must
assume
that
one
day
they
might
in
fact
be
storing
nuclear
weapons
there.
therefore,
the
question
that
triggers
the
environmental
impact
statement
process
is
the
proposal
to
build
a
bunker
which
is
nuclear
capable,
and
that,
of
course,
as
petitioners
have
conceded,
is
not
a
question
which
is
classified
or
secret
in
any
manner.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--if
they--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--if...
if
one
could
be
absolutely
assured--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--they
very
well
might
have.
i
have
not
examined
those
documents
for
their
adequacy
with
respect
to
merely
conventional
weapons.
ms.
nancy
stearns
pardon
me?
ms.
nancy
stearns
i
don't
challenge
the
hypothesis
if
in
fact
they
never
were
going
to
ever
even
consider
putting
nuclear
weapons
in
that.
however--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--and
the
proposal
is
to
build
a
nuclear
capable
bunker,
therefore,
by
definition,
i
don't
think
we
can
possibly
assume
that
they
would
never
consider
using
nuclear
weapons
in
those
bunkers.
ms.
nancy
stearns
then
i
think
we
would
have
to
be
remanded
for
trial
to
determine
whether
these
were
capable,
whether
they
were
adequate
for
a
non
nuclear
facility.
that
has
never
been
examined
in
this
record,
your
honor.
i
think
we
must
also
say
now,
however,
that
although
the
petitioners
will
not
confirm
nor
deny
the
presence
of
nuclear
weapons,
either
in
west
loch
or
in
waikele,
the
place
from
which
they
were
planning
to
move
the
nuclear
weapons,
we
must
recognize
that
there
are
photographs
in
this
record
of
waikele
and
of
nuclear
weapons
in
waikele,
that
there
are
all
of
the
indicia
at
west
loch
of
nuclear
weapons,
and
there
were
indicia
at
waikele
of
nuclear
weapons.
so,
i
think
that
we
must
go
with
the
court
below
and
say
that
as
long
as
those
bunkers
are
nuclear
capable,
we
must
in
fact
assume
that
one
day
nuclear
weapons
may
be
put
in
those
bunkers.
it
is
our
position
that
it
will
be
sooner
and
not
later,
but--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--justice
marshall,
i
think
what
we
are
saying--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--well,
more
than
likely
russia,
with
their
satellites,
just
like
we
with
our
satellites,
already
knows
where
our
nuclear
weapons
are.
ms.
nancy
stearns
pardon
me?
ms.
nancy
stearns
no--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--it
is
our
position
that
whenever
they
build
nuclear
capable
bunkers,
they
must
in
fact
prepare
an
impact
statement.
now,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
every
storage
facility
that
has
existed
for
many,
many
years
has
to
have
an
impact
statement
done
now.
ms.
nancy
stearns
that
is
a
question
which
was
never
explored
in
this
record.
it
is
not
altogether
clear
to
me
that
you
can
in
fact.
ms.
nancy
stearns
well,
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference
between
storing
trucks--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--however,
it
is...
we
do
have
an
affidavit
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
not
in
the
trial
court
record
which
raises
the
question
of
whether
you
cannot
in
fact
store
nuclear...
excuse
me,
conventional
weapons
in
a
xx
clear
capable
bunker,
because
of
the
proximity
between
the
various
bunkers,
and
the
quantity
of
conventional
explosives,
but
as
i
say,
and
that
it
might
possibly
be
more
dangerous
to
store
conventional
weapons
close
together
as
these
bunkers
are
placed
than
nuclear
weapons.
ms.
nancy
stearns
we
could
presumably
have
a
nuclear
bunker
with
nothing
in
it.
however,
just
as,
to
take
the
government's--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--no.
ms.
nancy
stearns
justice
marshal,
it
is
not
that
we
want
them
to
tell
us
where
the
bunkers
are.
we
have
a
case
before
us.
we
know
there
are
bunkers
here.
we
want
to
make
sure
that...
well,
we
would
have
liked
them
prior
to
building
those
bunkers,
but
that
is
too
late,
now.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
before
they
store
a
single
nuclear
weapon
in
those
bunkers,
they
do
all
of
the
processes
mandated
under
nepa
to
ensure
that
they
will
not
be
in
danger
of
having
the
kind
of
accident
that
could
spread
deadly
plutonium
across
the
island
of
oahu
and
make
honolulu
uninhabitable,
make
the
suburbs
uninhabitable,
cause
countless
numbers
of
cancer
deaths
over
a
period
of
years.
that
is
what
we
want
to
be
sure,
and
we
can't
be
sure
at
this
point
that
they
have
taken
those
factors
into
consideration.
ms.
nancy
stearns
that
has
not
been
defined
specifically
in
this
record.
presumably
in
the
district
court
it
was
just
assumed
that
when
the
government
was
using
the
word
"nuclear
capable"
as
it
appears
in
their
classification
guides,
that
it
merely
meant
that
one
could
store
nuclear
weapons
there,
and
presumably
there
are
some
different
factors
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account
when
building
a
bunker
that
stores
nuclear
weapons.
as
i
say,
that
was
not
explored.
ms.
nancy
stearns
this
case
is
talking
about
the
permanent
storage
of
a
significant
quantity,
because
a
significant
number
of
bunkers
were
in
fact
built
for
storage.
the
record
does
not
indicate
how
many
such
permanent
storage
facilities
exist
throughout
the
country.
that
was
never
raised
by
either
party
in
the
district
court.
there
have
been
explorations
by
private
parties,
but
it
was
never
a
factor
that
was
discussed
in
this...
in
this
court,
because
the
way
in
which
the
case
was
litigated
at
the
district
court
level
was
really
closer
to
the
pure
question
of
whether
or
not
the
atomic
energy
act
bars
preparing
an
eis
because
of
whether
or
not
it
would
necessitate
confirming
or
denying
the
presence
of
nuclear
weapons.
ms.
nancy
stearns
prevented
them
from
putting
the
nuclear
weapons
in
there?
ms.
nancy
stearns
well,
technically,
nepa
is
a
procedural
statute,
of
course.
ms.
nancy
stearns
so
that
the
conclusion
that
they
would
come
to,
even
assuming
they
concluded
it
was
a
bad
idea,
there
might
be
processes
through
the
administrative
procedures
act
to
challenge
that.
of
course,
the
other
questions
that
still
remain
in
this
case,
and
ones
that
the
court
of
appeals
remanded,
were
consideration
of
that
eis
in
relationship
to
the
national
historic
preservation
act
and
the
endangered
species
act,
so
that
it
is
possible
that
there
might
be
a
conclusion
that
the
navy
was
putting
the
weapons
into
those
bunkers
in
violation
of
one
of
those
two
other
statutes.
but
of
course
that
is
not
the
question
here
since
we
don't
have
an
environmental
impact
statement
at
all.
with
respect
to
that
point,
i
might
only
say
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
navy
did
suggest
that
they
had
met
the
requirements
of
nepa
by
having
prepared
this
environmental
impact
assessment,
which
really
only
discusses
considerations
relating
to
conventional
weapons,
for
example,
explosive
safety
zones
and
such,
and
by
doing
their
candidate
environmental
impact
statement,
which
is
a
very
superficial,
general
discussion
of
questions
relating
to
the
storage
of
nuclear
weapons,
but
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
ruled
that
that
eia,
the
environmental
impact
assessment,
and
the
ceis,
the
candidate
environmental
impact
statement,
were
not
adequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
nepa.
i
might
only
point
out
one
of
the
features
of
the
candidate
environmental
impact
statement,
which
was
supposedly
the
general
examination
of
the
question.
in
that
statement,
they
made
the
assertion
that
plutonium,
which,
of
course,
we
know
is
one
of
the
most
deadly
substances,
would
not
be
harmful
if
it
was
kept
outside
of
the
body.
however,
they
did
not
explore
how
one
in
fact
could
keep
it
out
of
the
body,
how
an
entire
population
could
keep
from
breathing
it
in
if
there
were
an
airplane
crash
that
created
a
fire
and
explosion
and
plutonium
dispersed
throughout
the
island.
ms.
nancy
stearns
with
respect
to
questions
regarding
storage
of
nuclear
weapons,
the
candidate,
but
it
has
such
major
defects
that
i
feel
i
must
say
that
that
is
not
very
informative,
either.
ms.
nancy
stearns
one
would
hope
they
would
not.
no.
a
statement
would
have
to
look
into
some
of
these
features
specifically,
and
the
statement
would
have
to
deal
with
the
one
thing
neither
of
these
documents
dealt
with,
which
is
the
question
of
storing
nuclear
weapons
right
near
major
airports.
this
weapon
facility,
remember,
is
one
mile
from
a
flight
path
to
the
honolulu
international
airport.
that
airport
alone,
forgetting
for
a
moment
that
there
are
two
military
airports
in
that
vicinity,
that
airport
alone
several
years
ago
had
a
quarter
of
a
million
takeoffs
and
landings
a
year.
that
is
a
great
number
of
planes.
that
is
all
the
planes
coming
to
and
from
the
mainland,
all
the
planes
going
to
the
far
east,
and
they
are
right
within
a
mile
of
that
flight
path,
and
lest
we
think
that,
well,
no
accident
will
ever
happen,
we
must
remember
that
two
serious
accidents
have
occurred
with
military
planes
that
crashed
unmanned,
where
the
pilots
had
to
evacuate,
right
into
the
pearl
harbor
area,
very
near
that--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--i
suppose
technically
you
would.
of
course,
here
we
don't
have
the
eis,
and
what
we
are
hoping
is
that
when
the
eis
examines
the
question,
if
there
is
a
conclusion
that
it
is
too
dangerous,
then
in
fact
the
navy
will
decide
not
to
store
nuclear
weapons
there.
up
until
now
they
have
not,
and
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
do
so.
they
could
find
an
alternative
location.
if
it
were
concluded,
after
full
examination
and
sharing
that
information
with
the
other
appropriate
governmental
bodies,
that
it
were
a
bad
decision,
that
it
were
too
dangerous,
that
decision,
of
course,
need
not
take
place.
ms.
nancy
stearns
there
is
not
specific
proof
they
can
be.
it
is
not
clear
under
what
circumstances
there
would
be
a
nuclear
detonation.
we
do
have
substantial
information
in
the
record
about
the
effects
of
a
nuclear
detonation,
which
would
be
catastrophic.
ms.
nancy
stearns
it
is
not...
it
is
not
definitive.
however,
we
do
have
information
in
the
record
about
what
might
happen
if
the
plane
crashed
into
a
weapons
bunker,
which
i
think
is
the
more
realistic
danger,
and
which
is
horrible
enough.
the
livermore
lab
did
a
study
which
indicated
that
if
a
plane
crashed
into
a
storage
bunker,
that
you
could
have
an
explosion
and
fire
that
would
lead
to
a
dispersal
of
plutonium.
ms.
nancy
stearns
it
doesn't
make
that
definitive,
but
the
other
problem...
there
are
two
possible
dangers
with
nuclear
explosives
in
a
bunker.
one
is
an
actual
full
blown
nuclear
detonation,
a
mushroom
cloud,
what
we
all
think
of
as
a
nuclear
detonation.
the
other,
and
exceedingly
serious,
is
merely
the
conventional
explosion
leading
to
the
dispersal
of
plutonium
which
is
kept
with
that
or
in
that
weapon.
that
plutonium
would
not
be
there
if
only
conventional
weapons
were
present,
and
it
is
the
dispersal
of
plutonium
alone
that
could
render,
according
to
the
livermore
labs,
100
square
miles
uninhabitable.
that
is
a
great
deal,
and
that
could
not
happen
if
it
were
only
conventional
weapons.
ms.
nancy
stearns
that
is
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
i
mean,
i
do
not
want
to
say
definitively
that
they
could
in
fact
go
on
and
store
them,
because
i
think
there
might
be
other
procedural
routes.
ms.
nancy
stearns
that
is
correct.
ms.
nancy
stearns
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
under
nepa,
it
would
not
stop
them.
there
are
other
statutes.
there
may
be
other
remedies.
but
of
course
that
is
not
the
question
here,
because
it
is
our
position
that
they
have
not
done
the--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--that's
correct.
ms.
nancy
stearns
that's
correct.
that
merely
proposing
to
build
a
nuclear
capable
bunker
is
what
triggers
the
statute.
that
is
a
major
federal
action.
that,
of
course,
is
what
the
district
court
found.
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
reiterated
that,
and
as
this
court
has
stated,
when
nepa
is
in
consideration,
one
is
supposed
to
go
through
the
process
at
the
earliest
possible
stage.
they
should
not
be
spending
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
constructing
bunkers
if
there
is
no
intention,
no
desire,
no
possibility
of
using
them.
the
bunkers
are
here
now.
but
we
do
need
an
eis,
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
has
not
been
done,
and
this
belated
hint
does
not
make
it
so.
ms.
nancy
stearns
there
are
several
possibilities.
one
would
be,
of
course,
what
can
be
done
in
other
cases
where
there
are
classified
information,
and
that
is,
it
could
be
examined
in
a
court
in
camera
to
determine,
first
of
all,
whether
or
not
everything
had
to
be
classified,
and
second
of
all,
whether
it
was
adequately
prepared.
this
court
has,
of
course,
dealt
with
questions
before
dealing
with
classified
information.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
not
all
of
it
need
be
classified,
that
the
reference
to
the
totten
case
is
an
inappropriate
reference,
because
there--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--well,
i
would
suggest
two
possibilities.
first,
i
would
suggest,
if
there
is...
either
if
it
has
been
ordered
or
if
it
is
exists
and
it
is
classified,
that
it
be
remanded
to
the
trial
court
and
that
there
be
an
examination
made
in
a
similar
fashion
to
other
classified
cases
where
perhaps
the
attorneys
be
given
security
clearances
and
be
able
to
litigate
before
the
court
whether
or
not
it
is
an
adequate
eis
and
whether
or
not
in
fact
everything
in
that
eis
need
in
fact
be
classified,
because
there
is
significant
unclassified
information,
clearly
unclassified
information
that
can
be
considered
publicly.
for
example,
merely
the
kind
of
an
arc
that
one
can
draw
around
an
airport
to
determine
the
likelihood
of
a
crash
in
a
particular
area.
in
our
record,
it
indicates
that
both
the
state
and
the
city
governments
in
honolulu
and
hawaii
feel
that
such
an
arc
should
be
drawn,
but
it
has
never
been
drawn.
so,
we
don't
know
the
likelihood
of
a
crash.
that
is
clearly
not
classified.
additionally,
the
government
is
trying
to
suggest
whether
they
have
even
done
one
is
classified.
well,
of
course,
as
we
have
already
stated,
the
question
of
whether
a
bunker
is
nuclear
capable
is
not
classified.
therefore,
it
need
not
be
classified
whether
they
have
done
one.
therefore,
what
we
have
should
be
a
document
which
might
be
partially
classified
and
partially
declassified.
the
classified
portions
are
in
classified
annexes,
just
as
the
navy's
regulations
suggest.
and,
of
course,
now
is
premature
to
determine
which
points
should
be
classified
and
which
declassified,
but
such
questions,
as
i
said,
as
the
likelihood
of
an
airplane
crash,
general
discussion
of
plutonium
dispersal,
which
has
on
previous
occasions
been
studied
by
scientists,
those
factors
can
be
considered
and
discussed
in
a
public
eis.
let
me
finally,
however,
just
refer
to
the
atomic
energy
act
question
which
has
been
raised
by
the
government,
because
we
feel
that,
too,
is
a
spurious
question.
the
petitioners
have
said
that
they
can
neither
confirm
nor
deny
the
presence
of
nuclear
weapons
specifically
because
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
and
that
that
prohibits
it.
that
is
not
true.
it
may
once
have
been
true.
that
may
have
once
been
restricted
data
under
the
act.
however,
it
is
now,
according
to
their
own
classification
guides,
what
they
call
formally
restricted
data.
what
that
means
is,
it
is
releasable
not
under
the
stringent
requirements
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
which
require
two
department
heads
to
concur
or
the
president
to
say
that
it
will
not
cause
an
unusual
risk.
rather,
it
can
be
released
to
the
public,
declassified,
merely
by
one
agency
head
or
a
designee
of
the
agency,
and
under
the
executive
order
they
specifically
say
that
even
when
there
are
occasions
that
information
is
properly
classified,
that
the
public
interest
may
be
paramount
and
may
say
that
it
is
appropriate
to
declassify
this
information,
and
therefore,
of
course,
it
would
be
critical
that
if
and
when
an
eis
is
prepared,
that
those
standards
be
applied,
and
there
not
be
an
overclassification
of
material
and
overuse
of
the
term
nepa
case.
when
the
government
in
their
reply
brief
tried
to
suggest
that
this
formally
restricted
data,
this
question
of
presence
or
absence
of
nuclear
weapons,
is
still
governed
by
the
atomic
energy
act,
they
referred
to,
i
believe
it
was
section
2162(d)
of
the
act,
which
says
that
so
long
as
the
information
remains
restricted
data,
it
can
only
be
given
to
another
nation,
if
you
go
through
the
procedures
of
the
atomic
energy
act.
that
is
true,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it
can
be
declassified
and,
as
i
said,
under
the
executive
order,
which
does
apply
once
it
is
formally
restricted
data,
it
can
be
declassified
under
the
standards
of
the
executive
order,
and
of
course,
then
that
means
the
federal
courts
can
examine,
just
as
they
do
under
the
foia,
that...
whether
or
not
that
classification
has
been
overused.
therefore--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--the
first
question--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--chief
justice
burger,
the
operative
question
under
those
circumstances
would
be
whether
or
not
the
submarine
coming
into
the
port
or
the
ship
coming
into
the
port
itself
constituted
major
federal
action.
we
had
an
entire
record
to
show
that
storage
of
nuclear
weapons,
particularly
at
this
site,
was.
i
do
not
know
whether
merely
coming
to
a
port
would
constitute
major
federal
action.
i
think
that--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--oh,
it
is
certainly
federal
action,
but
the
question
is,
under
the
mandates
of
nepa,
does
it
fit
within
the
concept
of
major
federal
action
with
a
significant
effect
on
the
environment.
that
is
what
i
am
saying
i
would
have
to
examine
much
more
closely
than
i
have.
that
has
not
been
something
i
have
considered.
and
it
is
this
whole
term
which
has
a
gloss
to
it
of
major
federal
action
with
a
significant
effect
on
the
environment
or
environmentally
controversial
that
is
what
the
court
below
and
the
district
court
both
felt
triggered
the
eis
process.
ms.
nancy
stearns
again,
i
think
that
that
would
have
to
be
studied,
because
it
is
not
just
whether
a
particular
nuclear
weapon
slips
in
and
out
of
the
port.
it
really
is
what
all
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
are,
i
think.
i
don't
think
the
very
existence
of
a
particular
weapon
anywhere
is
necessarily
a
major
federal
action,
because
that
would
presumably
mean
that
every
time
you
loaded
up
a
b-52
and
did
a
trial
run
across
the
united
states,
assuming
they
are
still
carrying
bombs
on
their
trial
runs,
that
it
would
be
major
federal
action.
i
think
that
is
unlikely.
there
may
be
a
substantial
difference
between
building
a
new
slip
and
building
an
entire
storage
facility,
particularly
a
storage
facility
located,
as
ours
is,
in
such
a
precarious
position.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
it
would
necessarily
be
a
major
federal
action.
ms.
nancy
stearns
well,
it
certainly
might
be
in
some
places.
i
would
think
that
it
might
very
well
be
if
you
have...
for
example,
if
you
have
this
new
slip
coming
in
right
next
to
an
airport
runway.
i
think
that
probably
would,
because
the
notion
is
the
significant
effect
on
the
environment
if
there
were
a
possibility
of
an
accident.
ms.
nancy
stearns
i
don't
want
to
condone
the
spots
that
the
navy
or
the
air
force
or
the
army
has
chosen.
ms.
nancy
stearns
we
can't
predict
how
many
airplanes
are--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--no,
but
what
we
can
do,
and
it
has
been
done
for
other
airports
in
hawaii,
is
draw
an
arc
which
will
consider
the
likelihood
of
an
airplane
crash.
similarly,
in...
when
we
are
now
building
nuclear
facilities,
nuclear
energy
facilities,
we
have
to
consider
certain
factors,
and
in
fact,
as
the
amicus
brief
pointed
out
of
the
national--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--i
think
it
would
probably
be
a
good
idea,
and
i
think
nepa
mandates
that.
ms.
nancy
stearns
yes,
i
do.
ms.
nancy
stearns
well,
this,
of
course,
is
not
a
wartime
question.
ms.
nancy
stearns
this
is
a
question
of
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
the
weapons
in
the
united
states,
adjacent
to
american
citizens.
it
is
not
a
question
of
what
will
happen
when
there
is
a
war
and
when
we
are
in
that
war.
it
merely
says
that
when
this
sort
of
decision
is
raised
of
storing
nuclear
weapons
in
close
proximity
to
a
major
population
and
near
a
major
airport,
three
airports,
in
fact,
that
nepa
mandates
preparation
of
an
eis.
thank
you
very
much.
