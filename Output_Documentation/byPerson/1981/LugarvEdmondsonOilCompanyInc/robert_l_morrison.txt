mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
the
court
today
is
another
challenge
of
the
pre-judgment
seizure,
somewhat
on
the
order
of
the
fuentes
case
and
its
various
progeny.
it
bears
a
rather
unusual
past
history
which
i
would
like
to
go
into
just
a
little
bit
because
it
bears
on
where
we
are
today.
mr.
lugar,
the
petitioner,
was
the
lessee/operator
of
lakewood
truck
stop
in
pittsylvania
county,
virginia,
down
near
the
north
carolina
border.
he
was
its
sole
proprietor.
mr.
barbour
is
the
president
of
edmondson
oil
company
who
sold
fuel
to
mr.
lugar
for
resale,
and
mr.
lugar
had
an
open
account
with
him.
that
was
the
only
relationship
between
edmondson
oil
company
and
mr.
lugar.
on
the
31st
of
may,
1977,
mr.
barbour
as
president
of
edmondson
oil
company
swore
out
a
pre-judgment
attachment
petition
in
the
circuit
court
of
pittsylvania
county,
which
is
the
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
virginia.
the
petition
in
question
alleged
that
mr.
lugar
was,
i
believe,
assigning,
concealing,
disposing
or
converting
his
assets
with
the
intent
to
hinder
or
delay
his
creditors.
no
fraud
was
alleged
in
the
petition.
this,
as
i
said,
was
sworn
out
on
the
31st
of
march,
1977.
on
the
1st
of
april,
1977,
it
was
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
of
the
circuit
court
of
pittsylvania
county.
the
clerk,
upon
receipt
of
the
petition
for
pre-judgment
attachment,
as
mandated
by
the
code
of
virginia,
issued
a
writ
of
attachment
to
the
sheriff
of
pittsylvania
county
directing
him
to
levy
on
mr.
lugar's
goods.
the
sheriff
did
levy,
as
is
shown
in
the
appendix,
in
his
return
on
the
1st,
the
2nd
and
the
4th
of
april
on
mr.
lugar
at
lakewood
truck
stop
and
also
on
his
bank
accounts.
at
that
point,
his
business
assets
were
frozen,
his
bank
accounts
were
frozen
and
he
was
prevented
from
doing
business.
in
virginia,
the
pre-judgment
attachment
petition
process
is
materially
different
from
the
detinue
process.
we
have
both.
for
a
pre-judgment
attachment
petition
you
need
only
appear
before
the
clerk
with
a
sworn
petition
alleging
that
the
defendant
debtor
is
concealing,
disposing,
assigning
or
converting
his
assets
with
intent
to
hinder,
delay
or
defraud
his
creditors.
now,
there
are
other
grounds
but
they
are
not
applicable
here;
they
deal
with
out-of-state
defendants.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
the
petition
for
an
attachment
is
the
filing
of
the
suit.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
the
attachment
petition
is
dismissed...
if
the
levy
is
dismissed,
i
should
say,
the
action
proceeds
as
a
motion
for
judgment,
which
is
the
same
thing
as
a
complaint
in
virginia
by
federal
procedure.
so
even
though
in
this
case
the
levy
was
dismissed,
it
went
on
as
a
motion
for
judgment
and
ended
in
a
judgment
against
mr.
lugar.
the
writ
issues
by
the
clerk
under
the
law
as
a
ministerial
act
on
the
filing
of
the
petition.
he
issues
a
writ
to
the
sheriff,
no
bond
is
required
for
the
levy,
although
a
bond
for
an
actual
physical
seizure
would
be
required.
the
sheriff
goes
and
levies
and
really
shuts
them
down,
because
the
bank
was
not
about
to
allow
him
the
use
of
the
money
with
a
levy
attached
to
it.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
i
would
say
it's
very
similar
to
fuentes
v.
shevin,
your
honor.
the
difference
that
i
would
make
between
this
and
fuents
v.
shevin
is
that
in
fuentes
v.
shevin
you
had
various
items
of
personal
property
such
as,
i
believe,
a
stove,
seized.
in
this
case
we
had
everything
seized,
or
everything
levied
upon.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
think
that
this
is
also
very
easily
comparable
to
the
north
georgia
finishing
case.
then,
when
the
sheriff
levies,
the
defendant
may
then
come
in
and
file
an
affidavit
of
substantial
defense.
when
he
files
that,
the
creditor
has
ten
days
in
which
to
post
a
bond
to
protect
his
levy.
the
levy
will
be
dismissed
if
the
bond
is
not
filed.
and
in
this
case,
a
bond
was
filed
after
the
affidavit
of
substantial
defense
was
filed
by
mr.
lugar.
the
statute
provides
that
when
the
petition
is
issued,
there
will
be
a
return
date
on
it,
and
in
this
case,
the
date
of
the
hearing
was
set
for
one
day
after
the
return
date;
the
return
date
was
the
18th
of
april,
the
hearing
date
was
set
for
the
19th,
and
a
hearing
was
held
on
that
date.
no
decision
with
respect
to
the
levy
was
received.
a
second
hearing
was
held,
i
believe,
on
the
1st
or
the
4th
of
may,
i
am
not
sure
which.
and
on
the
4th
of
may,
1977,
a
the
circuit
court
of
pittsylvania
county
finally
dissolved
the
levy
finding
that
no
grounds
whatsoever
had
been
proven
which
would
support
the
attachment.
then,
after
the
state
proceedings
were
concluded,
mr.
lugar
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
court
seeking
damages
for
deprivation
of
rights
guaranteed
under
the
constitution
under
42
u.s.
code
section
1983.
the
creditor
filed
a
motion
to
abstain,
alleging
that
a
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
might
eliminate
the
need
for
a
decision
on
federal
grounds.
that
was
the
only
thing
that
was
contained
in
that
motion.
we
briefed
the
issue
of
abstention.
the
district
court
turned
around
and
ignored
the
abstention
issue
and
dismissed
on
the
authority
of
flagg
brothers,
describing
the
conduct
in
flagg
brothers
as
more
flagrant
than
the
conduct
in
this
case.
lugar
sought
to
amend
the
judgment
or
to
have
it
modified,
was
unsuccessful
in
doing
so
on
appeal.
in
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
parties
addressed
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
reliance
on
flagg
brothers
was
appropriate.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
district
court's
reliance
on
flagg
brothers
was
not
appropriate,
but
affirmed
dismissal
on
a
different
ground
that
was,
again,
not
addressed
by
the
parties,
there
being
a
requirement
in
suits
of
this
sort
for
a...
either
an
allegation
or
a
finding
of
a
direct
conspiracy,
a
corruption,
if
you
will,
of
state
power
between
the
private
party
and
the
state
officials,
or,
in
the
alternative
as
i
understand
their
opinion,
such
an
abdication
of
control
over
state
power
is
to
make
the
state
merely
agents
or
the
state
just
gives
the
power
to
the
creditor.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
i
believe
they
do,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
this
court
has
put
a
gloss
on
the
meaning
of
under
color
of
state
law
to
include
actions
by
private
parties
which
are
joint
and
with
the
state.
and
in
this
situation
here,
the
state
acts
as
an
agent
of
the
private
party.
the
point
that
i
have
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
i
tried
to
make
to
the
district
court
was
that
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here
where
there
is
no
pre-attachment
property
interest
whatsoever
in
the
property
that
is
going
to
be
seized,
that
the
creditor
has
no
self-help
remedy
whatsoever.
if
he
was
to
act
for
a
self-help
remedy,
he
would
be
liable
for
criminal
penalties
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
if
that's
what
had
happened.
but
instead,
what
happens
is
the
state,
so
to
speak,
on
a
silver
platter
says
here,
you
may
use
us
to
take
sides
in
your
dispute
with
your
defendant
debtor
initially;
we're
going
to
seize
his
property
for
you.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
if
it
was
a
pre-judgment
garnishment,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
i
have
not
seen
any
in
my
practice,
your
honor.
i
have
filed
a
good
many
post-judgment
garnishments
against
debtors
when
i
was
conducting
collection
cases,
but
i
have
not,
that
i
can
recollect,
seen
a
pre-judgment
garnishment
in
virginia,
although
it
is
allowed
by
this
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
at
this
point
i
am,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
their
statement
is...
i
have
been
trying--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--no,
it
wasn't
briefed
and
we
never
even
addressed
the
issue
because
we
were
addressing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
flagg
brothers
applied.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
brought
it
here.
they
have
said
that
the
arguments
made
by
lugar...
and
the
district
court
has
said
the
same
thing...
amount
to
an
attack
on
the
statute
and
that
that
is
what
they
are
deciding;
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
constitutional.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
it
said
it
was
not
deciding
it
because
under
the
circumstances
it
didn't
have
to
decide
it.
it
found
that
there
was
no
action
under
color
of
state
law
by
the
private
parties.
but
what
it
said
was,
in
its
opinion
and
i
don't
know
the
exact
page
reference,
was
that
lugar
had
said
that
he
was
not
attacking
it,
but
in
fact,
that
is
what
he
was
doing.
but
what
i
was
attempting
to
do,
and
i
didn't
articulate
it
very
well,
was
say
to
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
there
is
no
need
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
because
the
state
and
the
creditor
acted
without
conforming
to
the
state
statute.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
need
for
this
court
or
any
other
court
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
if
the
creditor
and
the
state
break
their
own
law,
just
as
in
monroe
v.
pate.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would,
because
in
monroe
v.
pate
and
in
adickes
v.
kress
and
the
others,
if
the
state
is
acting
even
in
violation
of
its
law,
it
is
still
action
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
the
denial
of
due
process,
your
honor,
under
color
of
state
law.
the
power
and
authority
of
the
state
under
the
alleged
attachment
statute,
the
attachment
statute
we
are
dealing
with,
are
what
brought
the
levy
on
the
mr.
lugar's
assets.
the
state
acted.
the
state
acted
at
the
sole
behest
of
the
creditor,
but
it
acted
without
the
fraud
that
the
statute
requires
being
present
or
even
alleged.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
private
party
broke
virginia's
laws
in
the
sense
of
a...
for
instance,
a
criminal
violation.
what
happened
was
the
private
party
filed
a
petition
for
attachment
which
didn't
meet
the
full
requirements
of
the
virginia
law,
and
the
clerk
looked
at
it
and
issued
a
writ
anyway.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
in
the
virginia
court,
it
was
dismissed
as
being
improvidently--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
stand
corrected.
the
initial
question
is
whether
there
was
joint
participation
or
engagement
by
private
litigants
with
state
officials,
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
but
it--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--no,
sir,
it's
not.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is
under
shelly
v.
kramer,
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
the
erroneous
divorce
decree
is
going
to
affect
the
person
that
it's
entered
against.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
i
believe
theoretically
it
might,
but
i
know
that
virginia
has
procedures
for
dealing
with
that.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
i
agree
with
your
honor.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
this
case
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
finding
of
facts.
we
are
here
on
a
very,
very
skimpy
record.
what
is
being
attacked
in
the
district
court
is
the
action
of
the
creditor
with
the
state
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
if
they
have
to
be
made,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
your
honor,
the
original
complaint
alleged
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
color
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
that's
the
constitutional
violation.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
has
not.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir,
we'll
have
to
get--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
no,
sir,
and
i
don't
want
to
determine
it
here
because
we
don't
have
the
sufficient
facts.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
well,
your
honor,--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
understand
your
point.
the
complaint
as
filed
does
allege
a
denial
of
due
process,
and
it
alleges
that
the
parties
acted
under
the
color
of
state
law,
acted
jointly.
there
is
a
specific
paragraph
in
the
complaint
alleging
that
mr.
barbour
and
edmondson
oil
company
were
joint
participants
with
the
state
and
that
they
acted
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
the
question
presented
is
whether
on
the
facts
alleged,
there
was
no
joint
participation
or
engagement
by
private
litigants
with
state
officials,
amounting
to
action
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
no,
sir,
we
never
reached
the
due
process.
what
is...
at
least,
i
don't
believe
we
reached
the
question
of
due
process
there.
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
that
the
case
should
be
returned
for
a
decision
on
the
factual
and
legal
positions
taken
by
the
parties.
we
are
here
in
part
because
the
lower
courts
have
changed
the
grounds
of
the
decision
from
what
the
parties
were
arguing
each
time
they
made
a
decision,
so
that
the
questions
i'm
arguing
now
never
were
really
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understood
it,
because
we
were
addressing
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
flagg
brothers.
but
the
question
of
color
of
state
law--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
question
of
the
color
of
state
law,
but
we
were
arguing
about
is
whether
or
not
the
flagg
brothers
decision,
which
said
that
a
private
warehouseman's
lien
does
not
amount
to
action
under
color
of
state
law,
was
dispositive
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
well,
it
passed
on
it.
it
said
that
it
did
not
find
flagg
brothers
to
be
dispositive.
that
was
in
the
first
page
or
two
of
its
opinion.
it
specifically
made
that
statement,
and
then
it
said
that
it
was
going
to
affirm
on
other
grounds.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
your
honor,
we
are
here
with
the
initial
complaint
which
was
not
drafted
by
me,
and
i
might
say
that
it
was
drafted
by
my
then-employer
and
was
given
to
me
as
it
stood
after
it
had
been
filed
when
i
left
his
employment,
so
i
was
stuck
with
that.
the
complaint
attacks
the
action
of
the
creditor,
and
the
state
with
the
creditor,
on
the
basis
of
being
a
denial
of
due
process
under
color
of
state
law.
we've
never--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
claim
is
that
the
action
as
taken,
even
if
it
were
just
line
by
line
in
accordance
with
virginia
law...
whether
or
not
they
did
it
right,
the
claim
is
that
it
was
in
violation
of
lugar's
constitutional
rights.
i
don't
care
if
they
alleged
fraud;
we
would
still
claim--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--we
are
relying
on
the
involvement
of
the
state
of
virginia
in
a
process
which
we
believe
is,
on
the
face
of
it,
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
tried
to
draft
the
questions
presented
to
meet
the
force
and
effect
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
was
in
response--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--i
have
not
relied
directly
on
shelly
v.
kramer;
i
cited--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--no,
sir.
the
chief
justice
asked
me
about
an
erroneous
divorce
decree
as
being
an
action
under
color
of
state
law,
and
i
said
that
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be
based
on
the
shelly
v.
kramer
case,
that
a
judicial
act
is
an
act
under
color
of
state
law.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
situation
there
is
action
under
color
of
state
law.
the
state
is
fully
involved
up
to
its
neck,
figuratively
speaking,
with
the
private
party.
as
i
said,
to
do
for
the
private
party
what
the
private
party
cannot
do
for
itself,
by
any
means,
without
the
private
party
even
having
the
basic
requirement
that
was
found
to
be
important
in
the
mitchell
case
of
a
prior
property
interest
which
must
be
protected
and
prevented
from
being
depreciated.
in
this
situation,
the
creditor
simply
started
the
lawsuit
with
a
petition
for
pre-judgment
attachment,
which
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
as
submission
to
the
neutral
arbiter,
and
then
the
neutral
arbiter
turned
around
and
took
sides
immediately
and
seized
the
property.
and
when
it
seized
the
property,
it
shut
the
man
down
so
that
you
have
the
same
sort
of
effect
as
you
do
with
a
pre-judgment
garnishment
of
wages
in
both
lynch
and
sniadach.
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
under
the
circumstances,
where
the
state
is
going
to
involve
itself
to
that
extent,
that
in
fact,
there
is
action
under
color
of
state
law,
sufficient
at
least
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
as
a
result,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
send
it
back
for
trial.
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal,
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
to
address
the
last
point
made
by
mr.
haskins
first,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
complaint
clearly
states
what
the
plaintiff
alleges;
that
the
creditors
maliciously
and
jointly
with
the
state
deprived
him
of
his
rights.
and
that's
what
is
alleged.
the
flagg
brothers
opinion
in
footnote
10
specifically
accepts
that
from
the
effect
of
that
opinion,
the
pre-judgment
seizure
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
in
fuentes,
lynch,
sniadach,
north
georgia
finishing
and
in
mitchell.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
i
think
the
issue
has
to
be
raised
when
the
complaint
is
filed,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
preserved
as
best
possible.
as
i
have
said
to
the
court,
the
problem
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
rose
from
perhaps
my
misapprehension
of
the
holding
in
monroe
v.
pathe
among
others
that
action
taken
because
of
state
authority
and
power,
whether
or
not
legal
under
state
law,
still
amounts
to
state
action
under
color
of
state
law
because
the
state's
power
and
authority
is
what
makes
the
act
possible.
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
here.
the
state's
power
and
authority
is
what
has
made
the
deprivation
possible;
not
the
individual
acts
of
the
private
defendants,
taken
outside
of
the
context
of
the
state.
the
state
provided...
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
fuentes,
the
state
statute
effectively
abdicates
its
control.
the
state
provided--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--could
the
state
have
done
it
alone?
the
state
could
have
done
it
alone
if
the
state
had
the
necessary
pressing
reasons
that
this
court
has
found
in
cases
relating
to
health
or
drugs
or
cases
like--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--no,
sir.
it
took
them
both
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
it
took
them
both
to
do
it,
and
the
creditor
could
not
have
done
it
by
itself
without
being
subject
to
criminal
penalties,
because
it
had
no
self--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
i
concede
the
point.
but
the
thing
is
that
when
the
state
grants
a
divorce,
it
does
so
after
a
hearing.
it
does
so
as
a
neutral
arbiter.
that's
what
is
lacking
here.
the
state
does
not
act
as
a
neutral
arbiter;
the
state
comes
in
and
immediately
takes
sides
and
freezes
one
man's
complete
livelihood
and
assets.
and
does
it
under
color
of
state
law.
the
creditor
here
acted
with
knowledge
of
the
statute
and
with
intent
to
take
advantage
of
it,
as
this
court
has
found
to
be
a
requirement.
and
he
took
advantage
of
it,
and
mr.
lugar's
assets--
mr.
robert
l.
morrison,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
point
that
was
discussed
by
mr.
haskins
concerning
presumed
validity
of
state
judicial
proceedings.
as
i
understand
it,
any
act
by
the
legislature
is
presumptively
valid,
no
matter
what
attack
is
made
on
it
until
proven
otherwise.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
justice
stevens
has
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
there,
that
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
meant.
that
has
been
my
understanding
of
the
presumption
of
validity
of
legislative
enactments.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that's
all
i
have.
