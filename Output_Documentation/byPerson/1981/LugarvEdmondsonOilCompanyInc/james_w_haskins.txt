mr.
james
w.
haskins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
thing
that
the
respondents
specifically
disagree
with
as
stated
by
the
petitioner...
and
this
was
subject
to
comment
by
the
district
court
in
his
opinion
and,
of
course,
as
this
court
has
already
pointed
out,
subject
of
some
comment
by
the
court
of
appeals.
when
the
initial
complaint
under
section
1983
was
filed
in
the
district
court,
the
respondents
filed
a
motion
to
abstain
on
the
theory
that
the
complaint
had
to
be,
in
effect,
to
be
a
1983
action
it
had
to
be
some
sort
of
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
virginia
attachment
statutes.
the
respondents,
in
filing
the
motion
to
abstain,
requested
the
district
court
to
abstain
so
that
this
issue
could
be
properly
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
now,
in
arguing
the
motion
to
abstain
from
the
outset
of
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
affirmatively
disavowed
any
challenge
of
a
constitutional
nature
to
the
virginia
attachment
statutes.
on
page
5
of
the
district
court
record,
he
specifically
wrote
the
district
court
in
memorandum...
this
is
cited
in
our
brief...
saying
there's
no
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
being
in
issue.
now,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
this
ambivalence,
this
lack
of
any
sort
of
clear
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
persisted
in
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
on
page
53
of
the
petition
for
write
of
ceriorari,
which
contains
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
obvious
that
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
premised
in
part
on
the
presumptive,
valid
state
judicial
proceedings.
the
opinion
of
the
fourt
circuit,
taking
the
narrow
issue
as
presented
to
the
district
court
and,
of
course,
to
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
the
attachment
statutes
of
the
state
of
virginia
are
constitutionally
sound.
the
petitioner,
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
seems
to
assume
and
has
assumed
throughout
this
case,
that
state
action
and
acting
under
color
of
state
law
for
purposes
of
a
1983
action
are
the
same
thing.
now
clearly,
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
says
they
are
not
the
same
thing.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and,
of
course--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--yes,
sir.
the
complaint--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--well,
justice
marshall,
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
that
the
only
constitutional
challenge
at
that
point,
as
in
all
of
the
cases
from
fuentes
v.
shevin,
right
through
flagg
brothers,
whether
the
case
was
a
1983
case
or
whether
it
came
up
through
an
appeals
process
from
a
state
supreme
court,
there
has
been
a
direct
attack
on--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--yes,
sir,
now--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--justice
marshall,
what
the
petitioner--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--to
say
that
the
state
of
virginia,
sir,
is
responsible
in
some
way...
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment,
and
specifically
the
fourteenth
amendment,
deal
with
deprivations
of
property
by
the
state.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
i
understand
it...
and
i
would
stand
corrected
very
quickly
i'm
sure,...
but
it
offers
no
protection
from
deprivations
of
property
from
citizen
by
citizen.
in
the
entire
complaint,
the
three
counts,
sir,
the
petitioner
is
that
edmondson
oil
and
mr.
barbour,
its
president,
deprived
him
of
these
constitutional
rights.
nowhere
in
this
complaint
is
it
alleged...
in
fact,
the
petitioner,
as
i
said,
in
the
district
court
specifically
disavows
any
challenge
to
state
action.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
justice
stevens,
i'll
be
quite
frank
with
you,
sir.
i
don't
understand
that
footnote
in
relation
to
the
statement
of
the
issue
on
page
53,
some
five
or
six
pages
over.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
that's
correct,
sir,
i
agree
with
that.
but
certainly,
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals's
opinion,
again
as
they
call
it
the
dispositive
issue,
the
reasoning
that
follows
certainly
assumes
that
the
petitioner
has
invoked
presumptively
valid
state
judicial
proceedings.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
yes,
sir.
justice
blackmun,
our
position
is...
and
i
think
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
following
up
justice
stevens'
question...
that
state
action
and
acting
under
color
of
law
are
not
the
same
thing.
if
state
action
is
all
that
was
involved,
certainly
the
state
of
virginia
in
this
case,
through
the
actions
of
the
clerk
and
through
the
actions
of
the
sheriff
who
issued
the
attachment
and
levied
the
attachment,
certainly
there
was
state
action.
now,
the
question
is
where
the
state
judicial
proceedings
are
presumptively
valid,
as
in
this
case,
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
where
there
is
no
even
insinuation
that
the
clerk
and
the
sheriff
did
anything
wrong,
anything
out
of
the
ordinary,
in
fact
the
petitioner
clearly
states
that
they
acted
only
according
to
law...
he
states
that
in
the
statement
of
facts
to
the
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court.
the
question
then,
as
the
court
of
appeals
formulated
it,
is
granted
there's
state
action:
but
for
purposes
of
a
1983
action,
is
that
action
under
color
of
state
law
to
sustain
a
complaint
filed
under
the
1983
section.
and
of
course,
the
court,
of
appeals,
and
i
think
properly
so,
held
that
it
was
not.
now,
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
agree...
or
i
think
probably
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
too
severe
to
say
that
in
a
1983
action,
the
plaintiff
has
got
to
show
corruption
of
the
state
official
in
such
a
manner
that
it,
in
effect,
reduces
the
state's
power
to
a
joint
concert
and
joint
action
between
the
private
defendant.
i
think--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--yes,
sir?
what
is
my
reaction
to
that?
mr.
james
w.
haskins
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying,
justice
rehnquist,
as
pointed
out
by
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
to
flagg
brothers,
that
a
petitioner,
if
what
he
is
saying
is
simply
that
the
clerk
or
the
sheriff
in
issuing
or
levying
the
attachment,
that
there
were
just
certain
procedural
defects
in
the
virginia
law,
certainly
that
would
provide
an
alternative
basis
for
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
to
have
any
sort
of
challenge,
again
to
paraphrase
justice
stevens'
dissent
in
the
flagg
brothers
case,
for
a
jurisdictional
basis
of
1983,
there
has
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself.
as
i
read
all
of
the
cases,
fuentes,
sniadach,
north
georgia
finishing,
mitchell
v.
grant,
in
each
of
these
cases
there's
been
an
unquestioned
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute
itself
in
order
to
give
the
required
state
action
or
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
these
circuits
are
in
conflict.
justice
brennan,
in
regard
to
the
opinions
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
the
petitioner
has
cited
in
his
brief,...
there
are
some
five
or
six
from
the
various
circuits
throughout
the
country...
again,
in
each
of
these
cases
as
well
as
the
cases
that
i've
mentioned
by
this
court,
each
case
involves
a
direct
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
rights
through
the
substance
of
the
statute
itself.
that,
in
our
opinion,
sir,
is
what
is
lacking
in
this
case
as
far
as
giving
the
district
court
any
jurisdiction
under
1983.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
again,
i
will
try
to
respond
to
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
is
somewhat
in
conflict
with
the
statement
on
page
53
of
the
issue
they
framed.
they
definitely
assumed
on
page
53
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
that
the
statute
was
certainly
presumptively
valid.
and
the
judicial
proceedings
were
valid--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--well,
i
think
it
could
mean
this
also,
justice
stevens.
of
course,
this
case
was
dismissed
on
the
complaint
for
lack
of
any
federal
jurisdiction
under
1983.
what
they
are
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
due
to
the
petitioner's
constant
disavowal
that
he
is
making
any
attack
on
the
virginia
statutes,
we
must
therefore
assume
the
statute
is
valid.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
well,
i
think
this.
that
you
can
assume
the
virginia
statute
is
valid,
and
you
can
assume,
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out,
that
there
is
state
action
involved
by
the
virginia
court
clerk
and
the
virginia
sheriff.
now,
that
does
not
mean
or
does
not
necessarily
preclude
that
the
defendants,
the
respondents,
were
not
acting
under
color
of
state
law
if
some
way
there
was
some
sort
of
concerted
action
between
as
they
call
him
the
private
actor/respondent,
edmondson
oil
and
mr.
barbour,
with
a
state
official.
the
statute
can
be
perfectly
valid,
and
they
say
that
we
assume
it's
a
valid
statute.
we
assume
that
there
is
state
action.
there's
no
question
there
was
state
action.
but
a
1983
action
requires
a
third
element,
and
that
element
is
that
the
private
respondent
act
under
color
of
state
law
to
deprive
the
petitioner
of
a
federal
constitutional
right.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
in
dennis
v.
sparks.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
yes,
sir.
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
in
carey
v.
sugar,
the
new
york
case,
that
if
the
constitutionality
of
the
virginia
statute,
the
substantive
constitutionality
is
to
be
challenged,
then
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
and
this
case
should
have
been
referred
back
or
dismissed--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--no,
sir,
i
don't
think
there's
any
ambiguity
in
it.
i
think
the
virginia
statute,
as
far
as--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--well,
he
did
not
abstain,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
no,
i
thought
justice
rehnquist
said
if
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
an
issue.
of
course,
when
that
issue
came
up,
the
petitioner
clearly
wrote
the
district
court
a
memorandum
saying
he
was
not
challenging
the
constitutionality,
so
what
else
could
he
do?
in
the
trial
if
the
man
says
this
is
not
an
issue,
judge,
i'm
not
challenging
the
statute--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
says
that,
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
no,
sir.
my
point
is
this:
in
order
to
maintain
a
1983
action,
you
have
got
to
file
a
complaint
that
states
in
some
way
clearly
that
the
state
has
deprived
the
petitioner
of
a
federal
constitutional
right.
in
this
case,
if
there's
no--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--i
think
flagg
brothers
says
that.
i
think--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--on
page
6
of
my
brief,
the
red
brief,
justice
marshall,
"a
plaintiff
must
meet
two
requirements
to
show
a
valid
cause
of
action
under
1983.
"
and
this,
of
course,
is
from
flagg
brothers.
"the
deprivation
#"--
mr.
james
w.
haskins
--well,
this
is
what
flagg
brother
says.
mr.
james
w.
haskins
yes,
sir,
correct,
sir.
this
just
came
to
mind.
justice
marshall,
i
do
have
the
direct
quote.
it's
on
page
436
of
the
u.s.
reports,
page
157,
and
the
quote
is
this:
"a
claim
upon
which
relief
may
be
granted
to
respondents
against
flagg
brothers
under
1983
must
embody
at
least
two
elements.
"
"respondents
are
first
bound
to
show
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
a
right
secured
by
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
"they
must
secondly
show
that
flagg
brothers
deprived
them
of
this
right
acting
under
color
of
any
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york.
"
and
in
footnote
4,
justice
rehnquist
said
on
the
same
page,
"even
if
there
is
state
action.
"
--and
i
think
this
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
in
this
case...
"the
ultimate
inquiry
in
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
is
of
course
whether
that
action
constitutes
a
denial
or
deprivation
by
the
state
of
rights
that
the
amendment
protects.
"
i
think
clearly,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
basically
alleging
deprivation
of
his
property
by
these
malicious
creditors,
the
respondents,
not
by
the
state
of
virginia.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
dismissing
this
complaint
for
lack
of
any
1983
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
