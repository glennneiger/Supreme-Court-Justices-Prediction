unknown
speaker
but
you
filed
a
suit
either
simultaneously
or
suit
had
been
filed
either
simultaneously
or
before
that,
hadn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they
are
combined
in
one
document?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
this
is
just
like
fuents
against
shevin,
then?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it's
an
even
stronger
case
than
fuentes.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
goes
to
a
fairly
fundamental
point,
doesn't
it?
is
there
a
difference
between
the
fourteenth
amendment's
prohibition
which
is
addressed
only
to
states,
and
the
language
under
color
of
state
law
in
1983?
do
those
mean
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
it
were
a
garnishment?
unknown
speaker
host
garnishments
are
pre-judgment,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
not
clear
to
it
whether
you
were
alleging
or
asserting
that
the
virginia
statute
is
unconstitutional.
what
is
your
position?
are
you
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
virginia
statute?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
briefed,
so
it
was
hard
to
know
if
that
was
your
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
i
thought
the
issue
of
constitutionality
of
the
virginia
procedure
was
not
here.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
not
deciding
that
because
it
was
unclear
what
your
position
was.
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
be
a
1983
suit
anyway,
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
under
color
of
state
law,
but
what's
the
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
you
say...
didn't
you
have
some
appellate
remedy
in
virginia
if
the
state
broke...
or
the
private
party
broke
his
virginia's
law?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
set
aside
as
improvident
later,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
virginia
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
the
constitutional
issue
is
covered
in
your
questions
presented?
unknown
speaker
where?
i
didn't
see
it.
i
just
read
them
over
and
i
share
justice
marshall's
reaction.
it
said
federal
law,
and
i
guess
that
includes
the
constitution,
also
the
declaration
of
independence.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
not
a
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
how
far
would
you
carry
this
concept
of
state
action?
suppose
a
divorce
decree
is
entered
erroneously
in
some
way.
is
that
decree
of
the
court
state
action
in
the
sense
that
you're
arguing
it
here
today?
unknown
speaker
it
might
affect
a
person
in
the
sense
that
it
might
expose
one
or
both
of
the
parties
to
a
criminal
charge
of
bigamy
if,
in
fact,
the
divorce
was
not
a
divorce,
a
valid
divorce.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
my
comments
about
the
constitutional
issue,
don't
regard
them
as
undercutting
your
case.
i
think
your
case
is
here,
but
i
thought
the
issues
were
other
than
the
constitutional
ones.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean,
mr.
morrison,
if
you
prevail
and
there's
a
reversal
on
the
ground
that
indeed,
this
was
action
under
color
of
state
law,
then
your
allegations
of
unconstitutionality
are
still
to
be
determined
in
the
district
court
or
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
if
they
have
to
be
made?
you
don't
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
unless
you
allege
either
a
federal
constitutional
violation
or
violation
of
federal
law,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
your
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
and
that
hasn't
yet
been
determined.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
prevail,
this
conduct
was
under
color
of
state
law,
then
you'll
have
that
issue
determined.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
have
to
determine
it
here.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
don't
want
to
complicate
your
case
with
determining
it
in
any
way.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
morrison,
we
do
have
sufficient
facts
if
i
understand
the
problem
correctly.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
"under
of
color
of
state
law.
"
or
state
action
issue,
however
you
describe
it,
is
quite
different
if
you
are
alleging
a
failure
to
follow
the
virginia
statute
which
resulted
in
the
deprivation
of
due
process
on
the
one
hand,
or
are
you
alleging
that
the
virginia
statute
if
followed
to
its
letter,
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
are
making
the
latter
kind
of
contention.
it's
on
that
assumption
that
the
color
of
state
law
issue
must
be
addressed.
and
they
assume
that
if
you
merely
allege
deprivation
of
due
process
because
you
didn't
follow
the
virginia
law,
clearly
you
have
no
1983
case.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
if
i
made
that
clear
or
not,
but
they
were
quite
clear,
it
seemed
to
me,
in
saying
that
they,
despite
your
ambiguity
in
the
trial
court,
they
read
your
complaint
as
an
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
virginia
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
decide
it
because
they
said
even
as
so
read,
there's
no
state
action
or
color
of
state
law.
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
asked
me
in
argument,
do
you
think
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
said
yes,
and
i
do
think
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
and
if
you
don't
so
contend,
they
also
indicated
you
wouldn't
have
any
basis
for
a
1983
claim.
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute;
but
i
think
we
must
decide
the
state
action
issue
on
the
assumption
that
you
seek
to
challenge
the
virginia
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
that
question
is
not
here;
at
least
it
is
not
in
the
questions
presented,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
says
nothing
about
the
due
process.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
it
get
here?
if
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
consider
it
at
all,
how
does
it
get
here?
unknown
speaker
then
isn't
your
real
complaint
that
the
court
of
appeals
so
far
departed
from
normal
usage;
you
argued
a
claim
to
it
that
you
had
raised
in
the
district
court
and
it
refused
to
pass
on
it?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i'm
still
uncertain
what
your
claim
is.
do
you
now
concede
that
you
are
not
here
on
a
claim
that
the
creditor
and
the
state
acting
with
the
creditor
simply
violated
virginia's
statutory
law
and
procedure?
unknown
speaker
is
that
on
the
theory
that
the
creditor
and
the
state
simply
improperly
applied
virginia's
law?
unknown
speaker
or
improperly
applied
the
facts
to
virginia's
law?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
that
i'm
still
confused
as
to
whether
you're
relying
on
constitutionality
of
the
statute
or
on
some
erroneous
allegation
of
facts
by
the
creditor.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
your
raise
that
in
your
questions
presented?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
lost
your
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
they
said
your
case
is
over
because
there's
no
color
of
state
law
involved.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
they
were
absolutely
wrong
in
saying
there
was
no
color
of
state
law
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that's
one
of
the
things
you're
arguing
anyway.
and
you
want
whatever
the
court
of
appeals
decided
reversed,
and
what
they
decided
was
that
there
was
no
color
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you
answered
me
earlier.
if
you
prevail
as
to
that,
and
what
you
want
is
a
trial
on
your
allegations
that
the
virginia
statute
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
shelly
v.
kramer,
right?
didn't
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
rely
on
shelly
v.
kramer.
unknown
speaker
because
i
notice
it's
not
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
mr.
haskins,
they
did
allege
in
their
complaint
due
process.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
they
didn't
ever
raise
the
constitutional
point.
they
did
raise
it
in
their
complaint.
unknown
speaker
this
says
on
page
6
of
the
appendix,
giles
m.
lugar
has
been
deprived
of
his
property
by
state
action
without
due
process
of
law,
as
guaranteed
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
unknown
speaker
that's
kind
of
direct,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
ask
you
how
you
would
be
more
direct.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
haskins,
i
know
he
did
that
in
the
district
court.
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
45
of
the
cert
petition,
the
court
recognizing
this
problem,
as
a
footnote
says,
"we
construe
lugar's
claim
to
include
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute
itself.
"
now,
we
must
so
interpret
the
claim,
must
we
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
rather
unambiguous,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
make
it
quite
clear
that
if
they
thought
he
was
merely
alleging
a
misapplication
of
the
virginia
statute,
that
there
would
be
no
1983
claim
at
all.
unknown
speaker
so
in
order
to
have
something
to
write
this
rather
long
opinion
about,
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
at
least
read
the
complaint
to
include
a
challenge
to
the
statute
itself.
and
therefore,
the
state
action
issue
is
whether
the
virginia
legislature's
statute,
plus
the
involvement
of
the
clerk
and
the
sheriff,
is
enough
state
action
to
trigger
1983.
unknown
speaker
mr.
haskins,
in
your
brief
you...
i
think
you
do
anyway...
you
disavow
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals.
do
you
adhere
to
that
position
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
haskins,
it's
obvious
that
there
is
some
confusion
as
the
case
progressed
through
the
courts,
and
perhaps
further
questioning
is
not
a
satisfactory
way
of
resolving
it,
but
what
do
you
make
of
the
pen
ultimate
paragraph
of
the
footnote
1
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
44
where
they
say,
"as
will
appear,
it
has
not
been
necessary
in
our
disposition
of
the
appeal
to
address
the
question
of
whether
the
property
seizure
was
constitutionally
invalid
on
either
ground.
"
"we
therefore
note
this
confusion
only
to
observe
that
had
the
challenge
been
limited
to
a
claim
of
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute
in
the
course
of
the
state
attachment
proceeding,
we
would
have
had
a
clear
alternative
basis
for
affirmance
of
the
dismissal.
"
"it
is
well
settled
that
no
cause
of
action
lies
under
section
1983
to
redress
deprivations
of
procedural
due
process
occurring
during
state
court
litigation
between
private
parties.
"
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
haskins,
i
gather
from
the
citations
in
that
footnote
that
my
brother
rehnquist
referred
to,
there's
no
decision
of
this
court
that
no
cause
of
action
lies
under
1983
to
address
deprivations
of
procedural
due
process.
and
those
citations
indicate
that
the
circuits
are
in
conflict
over
it.
that
the
fifth
and
second
so
hold,
perhaps
also
the
tenth,
but
the
first
apparently...
note
the
"but
see
kermit"...
apparently
goes
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
not
a
procedural
default--
unknown
speaker
--again,
though,
apparently
court
of
appeals,
as
justice
stevens
suggested
earlier
to
mr.
haskins,
going
on
with
that
footnote
1,
"therefore
constitute
this
complaint
as
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute
itself.
"
and
not
merely
a
procedural
default.
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
really,
all
that
means
is
that
if
you
get
to
the
merits
of
the
statute,
the
burden
is
on
the
person
challenging
the
statute
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
validity.
that's
all
that
means.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
true
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
state
action
or
anything
else.
they
wouldn't
have
written
this
long
opinion
if
that
was
their
rationale.
i
think
he's
saying
it's
presumptively
a
valid
statute
and
therefore,
you've
got
to
have
something
more
than
the
action
of
the
clerk
and
the
sheriff
in
order
to
say
that
it
was
a
deprivation
by
the
state.
and
that
is
that
half
of
the
two-pronged
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
that's
like
analyzing
the
case
in
terms
of
the
bribery
of
the
judge
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
one
theory
and
they
reject
that
theory.
but
i
really
don't
think
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
complaint
to
say
that
he
has
alleged
that
kind
of
corruption
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me,
given
the
gloss
that
the
court
of
appeals
puts
on
it
in
its
footnotes,
it
seems
to
me
we
should
analyze
the
case
as
though
he
made
a
clear-cut
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
and
then
ask
on
that
assumption,
is
there
sufficient
state
involvement.
and
shouldn't
we
also
ask
as
to
whether
the
court
was
proper
in
denying
a
motion
to
abstain?
unknown
speaker
why
should
he
abstain?
there's
no
ambiguity
in
the
virginia
statute,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
why
would
he
abstain
then?
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you're
suggesting
now
that
he
should
have.
unknown
speaker
once
again,
give
the
case
of
this
court
that
said
that
in
order
to
maintain
an
action
under
1983,
you
must
attack
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
cite
me
a
case
that
says
that.
because
1983--
unknown
speaker
--well,
quote
it
to
me,
let
me
see
it.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
any
quote
on
this
page
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
asked
for
the
quote.
well,
with
all
respect
to
my
colleague,
justice
marshall--
--well,
with
all
due
respect
to
you,
i
have
a
right
to
ask
the
question.
well,
with
all
respect
to
you,
i
was
just
going
to
suggest
that
certainly,
the
requirement--
--go
right
ahead,
i
don't
want
to
delay
anything.
--that
the
constitutional
issue
be
raised--
--if
he
doesn't
want
to
convince
me,
it's
all
right.
and
you're
suggesting
i
won't
either.
[laughter]
--at
its
earliest
possible
moment
and
preserved
throughout,
doesn't
date
from
flagg
brothers.
it
dates
from
cases
like
holbrook
v.
chicago
and
cases
that
go
back
to
the
nineties
and
eighties,
it
is
my
recollection.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
you
don't
quarrel
with
the
proposition,
do
you,
that
if
one
is
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute,
that
issue
must
be
raised
at
its
earliest
possible
moment
and
preserved
throughout
the
case?
unknown
speaker
and
preserved?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
could
either
have
done
it
alone?
unknown
speaker
this
whole
thing
wouldn't
have
happened
without
the
filing
with
the
clerk.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
wouldn't
grant
a
divorce,
presumably,
if
no
one
asked
it
to.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
a
divorce
claimant
or
anybody
else
invoking
the
judicial
process
of
the
state,
if
he's
trained
in
the
law,
is
presumably
invoking
some
state
procedure
that
is
recognized
by
the
courts
of
that
state.
