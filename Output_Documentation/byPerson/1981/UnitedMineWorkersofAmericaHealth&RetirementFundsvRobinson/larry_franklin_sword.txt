mr.
larry
franklin
sword
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
important
at
the
outset
to
note
the
limits
of
this
case.
the
trustees
concede
three
important
points.
first,
the
trustees
concede
if
they,
the
trustees,
had
formulated
this
provision,
that
it
would
be
reviewable.
indeed,
there
is
no
disagreement
among
the
lower
courts
over
the
courts'
power
to
review
eligibility
provisions
which
have
been
formulated
by
trustees,
and
that
section
302
prohibits
the
trustees
from
formulating
eligibility
provisions
which
would
deny
coverage
to
persons
with
substantial
contributory
work
histories
while
granting
benefits
to
persons
with
lesser
contributory
work
histories,
unless
there
is
a
rational
nexus
between
the
provision
and
a
valid
purpose
of
a
302
trust.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
that
issue
has
never
been
before
this
court.
however,
in
the
case
of
nlrb
versus
amax,
this
court
noted
that
there
are
fiduciary
duties
which
are
placed
on--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--i
don't
believe
that
any
court
has
ever
said
that
their
duties
are
not
reviewable.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
i
believe
that
the
amax
case
talks
about
the
differences
between
bargaining
representatives
and
the
trustees.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
yes,
it
did.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
indeed.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
we
take
the
position
that
trustees
are...
their
duties
are
reviewable.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
in
any
of
the
cases
that
the
trustee's
actions
are
reviewable,
and
i
think
that
the
lower
federal
courts
which
have
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
trustee
formulated
eligibility
provisions
can
be
arbitrary
or
not
have
consistently
held
that
the
provisions
cannot
exclude
persons
who
have
contributory
work
histories
that
are
substantial
unless
there
is
a
rational
nexus
for
the
provision.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
except
this
one,
maybe,
and
the
congress
has
shown
in
enacting
erisa,
it
has
provided
that
trustees
are
to
follow
the
trust
documents
only
insofar
as
the
trust
documents
do
not
cause
a
breach
of
any
fiduciary
duty.
and
the
trustees
concede
a
second
point,
which
is
that
if
the
respondents'
husbands
had
quit
work
and
filed
applications
for
retirements
instead
of
continuing
to
work
in
contributory
work,
that
then
these
widows
would
be
granted
this
benefit.
the
third
point
which
the
trustees--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--not
all
persons
in
the
respondents'
class.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
some
of
them
would,
but--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--no.
the...
what
they
are
referring
to
there
is
a
death
benefit
which
is
provided
to
the
family
of
an
active
worker.
an
active
worker,
regardless
of
how
long
he
had
worked
in
the
mines,
whether
it
was
20
years
or
one
day,
if
he
passed
away
while
actively
employed,
there
was
that
payment.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
if
he
was
eligible
or
not.
the
trustees
in
effect
concede
that
this
provision
is
arbitrary.
they
have
tendered
no
justification
for
the
provision
other
than
it
was
collectively
bargained.
in
fact,
there
is
no
question
that
this
provision
is
arbitrary.
the
arbitrariness
can
be
shown
by
looking
at
the
hypothetical
of
twin
brothers.
you
could
have
one
brother
who
could
go
to
work
in
a
non-contributory
mine,
work
19
years
in
that
non-contributory
mine,
then
work
one
year
in
contributory
employment,
and
then
have
retired
and
drawn
benefits
for
a
number
of
years,
and
died.
that
brother's
widow
would
receive
this
permanent
health
care
coverage.
if
his
twin
brother
could
have
worked
for
19
years
in
a
contributory
mine,
or
even
more,
but
worked
his
last
year
in
a
non-contributory
mine,
or
you
know,
died
without
retiring,
that
brother
who
had
worked
19
years
in
contributory
employment,
his
family
would
receive
absolutely
nothing,
no
death
benefits,
his
widow
would
receive
no
health
benefits
whatsoever.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
yes.
the
contract
provides
that
the
widow
of
a
pensioner,
upon
the
pensioner's
death,
received
$2,000.
the
widow
of
an
active
miner
who
at
the
time
of
his
death
happened
to
be
working
in
a
union
mine,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he
was
pension-eligible--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--would
receive
$5,000.
it
is
more
of
a
funeral
payment.
in
fact,
the
facts
of
our
case
show
the
arbitrariness
of
this
situation.
juanita
hager's
husband
had
worked
from
the
time
he
was
a
teenager
in
the
mines.
he
had
worked
39
years
in
the
coal
mines.
the
last
24
years
that
he
worked
was
for
a
contributory
employer.
and
yet
juanita
hager
is
denied
this
benefit
because
mr.
hager
was
still
working
in
contributory
employment
at
the
time
he
died,
and
he
had
not
filed
an
application.
likewise,
gracie
robinson's
husband
had
worked
more
than
30
years
in
the
coal
mines.
the
last
21
years
of
his
life
he
spent
working
in
a
contributory
coal
mine,
paying
into
the
funds.
and
yet
these
widows
are
both
denied
this
benefit
that
is
being
provided
to
some
widows
whose
husbands
had
as
little
as
one
year
of
contributory
service.
throughout
this
litigation,
the
trustees
have
not
shown
any
justification
for
the
provision,
any
rational
nexus
between
the
purpose
of
a
fund
and
this
exclusion.
instead
they
say
that
because
it
was
collectively
bargained,
it
is
immune
from
judicial
review,
and
that
issue,
whether
the
mere
collective
bargaining
of
a
provision
can
immunize
it
from
judicial
review
is
the
only
issue
in
this
case.
this
case
presents
a
very
narrow
set
of
circumstances,
and--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--well,
be
contented
that
judicial
review
is
clearly
authorized,
that
without
judicial
review
these
beneficiaries
of
these
funds
would
in
no
way
have
protection.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
we
contend
that
that
authority
is
within
section
302
of
taft-hartley,
and
within
the
cases
that
have
interpreted
that
provision.
when
congress
enacted
section
302,
it
was
concerned
that
the
earned
contributions
of
workers
could
be
arbitrarily
disposed
of
by
the
unions
unless
there
was
some
protection
and
some
control
over
these
funds.
congress
in
1947
saw
a
potential
for
abuse
whenever
unions
had
any
control
over
these
trust
funds,
and
provided
that
there
would
be
review,
and
that...
so
that
these
funds
would
not
become
a
union
war
chest.
without
302's
protections,
eligibility
decisions
could
be
made
solely
on
terms
to
further
the
union's
benefit,
not
in
a
manner
to
further
the
beneficiaries'
benefit.
so,
congress
intended
302
to
be
remedial;
it
provided
a
private
cause
of
action,
so
that
be
enforced,
and
so
that
the
rights
could
workers
could
protect
their
rights.
subsequent
to
section
302's
enactment,
numerous
federal
court
cases
have
ruled
that
eligibility
provisions
under
a
section
302
trust
cannot
be
arbitrary,
that
you
cannot
exclude
persons
with
substantial
contributory
work
histories
at
the
same
time
you
are
granting
benefits
to
similarly
situated
persons
with
lesser
contributory
work
histories
unless
the
trustees
can
show
a
rational
nexus
between
that
provision
and
a
valid
purpose
of
the
fund,
which
is
to
reward
workers
for
their
contributory
work.
it
is
important
to
note
that
congress
has
added
a
number
of
amendments
to
section
302(c)(5)
through
the
years,
and
that
has
been,
even
though
there
have
been
two
decades
of
court
decisions
which
have
imposed
on
these
trusts
this
arbitrary
prohibition,
this
prohibition
that
you
cannot
have
these
arbitrary
provisions
in
the
trust--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
show,
you
know,
the
substantive
requirements
as
far
as
how
many
years
of
work
or
anything
along
those
lines,
but
the
legislative
intent
does
show
that
congress
couched
section
302
in
trust
terms
so
that
the
workers
would
be
protected.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
language
shows
that
congress
wanted
these
funds
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
workers,
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
union.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
we
contend
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
one
example
of,
if
there
is
no
judicial
review,
of
what
the
trust...
how
the
trust
could
be
used
to
further
union
benefits,
because
it
is
clear
in
the
negotiations
in
this
case
that
the
collective
bargainers
were
not
concerned
with
the
merits
of
any
of
the
classes.
they
were
not
concerned
with...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
not
even
consider
our
class,
but
instead
the
union
was
insisting
upon
one
group's
inclusion,
because
they
were
concerned
that
there
was
a
vocal
group
which
wanted
benefits
for
a
certain
group,
and
they
considered
that
group
a
no
compromise
item
because
of
that
vocal
group.
for
instance,
there
was
one
memorandum
which
was
drawn
up
during
the
negotiations
in
which...
concerning...
i
think
this
is
just
an
example...
benefits
for
widows
of
active
miners
regardless
of
years
of
service,
and
they
say,
"umwa
sees
no
compromise
possible
here,
views
this
as
potentially
dangerous
post-ratification
issue,
especially
in
southern
west
virginia.
"
and
the
importance
of
that
is
that
there
were
certain
groups,
the
union
was
concerned
that
there
could
be
wildcat
strikes
or
other
things
which
would
embarrass
the
union,
and
so
the--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--yes.
we
are
not
challenging
the
fact
that
there
were
benefits
provided
to
the
widows
of
miners
who
would
be
working
in
the
future.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
we
would
have
a
case
if
they
were
granting,
as
they
did
in
this
provision,
benefits
to
the
widows
of
men
who
had
quit
work
in
the
past.
the
benefits
are
provided
under
the
1950
benefit
plan
to
the
widows
of
pensioners--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--and
if
they
were
only
providing
benefits
to--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--then
we
would
not
have
the
situation
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
then
we
would
not
have
a
case.
but
the
facts
of
this
case
are
different.
they
did
grant
this
coverage
to
similarly
situated
widows,
some
of
whose
husbands
had
this
insignificant
years
of
contributory
work
history.
they
granted
it
to
widows
of
retirees
who
had
passed
away
prior
to
the
negotiations.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
the
trustees
contend
that
that
would
not
even
be
reviewable.
we
contend
that
that
would
not
be
lawful,
that
the
distinctions
between
persons
who
receive
benefits
and
the
persons
who
are
denied
benefits
must
be
drawn
on
a
rational
basis.
if
benefits
are
going
to
be
denied
persons
with
massive
contributory
work
histories,
with
many
years
of
working
in
contributing
work
employment,
while
at
the
same
time
they
are
granting
it
to
persons
with
lesser
work
histories,
there
must
be
a
rational
nexus
shown.
there
must
be
a
purpose
of
the
trust
fund
that
would
be
furthered
by
such
a
provision.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
well,
the
cases
have
shown
that
the
mere
saving
of
money
is
not
a
justification.
if
so,
any
restriction,
regardless
of
how
arbitrary,
would
be
justified.
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
after
the
various
court
cases
which
have
held
that
there
is
judicial
review
of
eligibility
provisions,
congress
did
enact
erisa,
and
erisa
was
enacted
at
a
time
when
it
was
well
established
that
there
was
judicial
review
of
eligibility
provisions
which
were
formulated
by
trustees,
and
yet
erisa
left
section
302(c)(5)
in
effect
and
erisa
in
effect
codified
and
strengthened
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
standard
which
the
courts
have
interpreted
under
302(c)(5)
to
prohibit
this
type
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
provisions.
the
congress
was
concerned
in
enacting
302(c)(5)
with
the
fact
that
workers'
contributions
could
be
subject
to
union
manipulations,
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
show
that
that
indeed
is
a
possibility
whenever
the
negotiators
are
involved
in
this
area,
and
the
protection
is
the
judicial
review.
the
trustees'
position
that
these
rules
are
unreviewable
and
do
not
have
to
bear
a
rational
nexus
to
a
valid
purpose
of
a
302
fund,
their
position
would
open
the
door
to
unions
manipulations
of
these
funds,
would
allow
the
unions
to
accomplish
at
the
bargaining
table
what
would
be
unlawful
for
them
to
accomplish
as
trustees,
and
it
would
leave
retirees
and
widows
totally
unprotected
for
under
the
trustees'
argument
these
eligibility
provisions
could
be
drawn
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
workers,
but
to
further
the
benefit
of
the
union.
the
collective
bargaining
of
a
provision
does
not
afford
any
of
the
protections
to
an
active
worker
which
is
required
under
section
302(c)(5).
the
trustees'
argument
concerning
allied
chemical
workers
is
not
correct,
because
this
case
does
not
involve
a
situation
where
the
parties
were
being
forced
to
bargain
to
impasse.
the
collective
bargainers
in
this
case
freely
undertook
to
create
a
section
302
trust.
we
contend
that
when
they
created
that
302
trust,
they
created
a
creature
of
federal
law,
that
trust
must
comply
with
federal
law.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
under
erisa,
suit
can
be
brought
against
the
trustees,
and
also
under
the
very
trust--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
we
feel
that
the
trustees
in
this
situation
could
have
sued
to
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
the
very
wage
agreement
in
this
case
and
the
trust
documents
themselves,
justice
white,
both
provide
that
the
trustees
are
to
reform
these
trusts
to
comply
with
federal
law,
that
the
trustees
are
to
reform
this
trust
to
comply
with
any
court
decisions.
we
contend
that--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--against--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--even
the
district
judge
gesell--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--we
contend
that
when
it
was
apparent
to
the
trustees
that
this
provision
was
arbitrary
and
unlawful,
they
could
have
gone
back
to
the
settlors
and
said,
this
is
arbitrary,
or
they
could
have
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
under
the
trust
documents,
because
the
provision
was
unlawful--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--they
had
the
ability
to
change
the
trust.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
when
it
was
brought
to
their
attention,
they
could
see
it,
or--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--when
it
was
brought
to
their
attention
by--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--gracie
robinson
and
juanita
hager--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--they
don't
have
to
take
their
word.
they
can
go--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--they
could
go
to
court,
ask
for
a
court's
determination--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--they
could
go
to
court,
and
they
could
go
back
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
they
would
not
have
to.
the
trust
documents
themselves
empower
the
trustees
to
reform
these
trusts.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
if
it
is--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--if
it
is
unlawful.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
if...
they
could
go
to
court
and
have
the
court
determine
that.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
they
could,
or
they
could
have
gone
back
to
the
collective
bargainers
and
asked
for--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--then
the
trustees
should
have
asked
for
a
judgment.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
we
did
not,
because
the
trust
documents
themselves
provide,
and
also
under
erisa
there
is
a
provision
that
the
plan
itself
can
be
sued.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
the
district
court
found
that
the
provision
in
the
contract
and
a
provision
in
the
trust
document
both
provided
that
the
trustees
were
empowered
to
change
this
trust
document
if
it
was
shown
that
the
exclusion
of
this
class
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
if
a
court
determined
that
the
exclusion
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
the
trustees
were
to
change
the
documents.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
the
district
judge
concluded
that
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
collectively
bargained,
that
therefore
we
were
not
entitled
to
relief.
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
he
said
that
this
provision
was
the
result
of
collective
bargaining,
and
so
therefore
it
was--
mr.
larry
franklin
sword
--that
is
what
the
district
court
found,
and
that
is
the
incorrect
standard
to
apply
to
a
section
302
trust.
the
judicial
review
which
is
normally
applied
to
collectively
bargained
contracts
is
a
limited
judicial
review.
the
review
is
normally
applicable
to
cases
in
which
you
are
dealing
with
issues
which
are
relevant
to
active
employees.
now,
the
active
employee
has
many
remedies
and
many
protections.
the
active
employee
has
nlrb
protections,
is
afforded
a
duty
to
fair
representation,
has
a
voice
in
the
union,
has
a
vote
in
the
contract,
and
yet
the
retiree
or
their
survivor
has
none
of
these
protections.
for
the
respondents'
class,
the
only
protection
is
the
requirement
in
section
302,
and
the
requirement
in
the
case
law
that
these
eligibility
provisions
not
be
drawn
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner.
the
testimony
shows
that
the
collective
bargainers
did
not
even
consider
the
fact
that
there
were
men
who
were
age
eligible
and
years
of
service
eligible
to
retire,
but
who
had
not
retired
and
filed
applications
for
pensions
because
they
had
continued
working
past
retirement
age
in
contributory
employment,
and
had
died
while
still
actively
employed.
there
was
no
good
faith,
active,
intense
bargaining
as
to
our
group.
there
was
no
consideration
of
the
cost
of
our
group
or
of
their
merits.
the
union
negotiator,
one
of
the
union
negotiators,
mr.
pearce,
noted
that
there
was
no
trade-off
and
that
the
respondents'
class
was
omitted
not
on
the
merits.
as
we
mentioned,
the
reason
that
our
class
was
omitted
was
because
they
were
not
considered.
the
union
only
considered
the
vocal
class
that
the
union
thought
would
embarrass
the
union
after
ratification
of
the
contract,
and
when
the
bargaining
stopped,
our
class
was
left
out
for
no
reason
whatsoever.
the
trustees'
position,
if
adopted,
would
mean
that
any
provision,
regardless
of
how
arbitrary,
could
be
readopted
by
the
collective
bargainers,
and
then
there
would
be
judicial
immunity.
for
instance,
the
signatory
last
employment
requirement,
which
the
defendant
funds
had,
and
which
was
invalidated
in
roark
v.
boyle
and
roark
v.
lewis,
if
the
trustees
in
those
cases
had
simply
gone
to
the
collective
bargainers
and
said,
the
court
says
this
provision
is
arbitrary,
under
their
theory,
the
collective
bargainers
could
say,
we,
the
collective
bargainers,
think
this
is
a
good
provision,
and
therefore
the
courts
would
have
no
review
whatsoever.
we
contend
that
that
position
is
not
supported
in
the
case
law,
that
that
total
abdication
of
their
fiduciary
duties
was
not
envisioned
by
congress
when
it
enacted
302(c)(5),
was
not
envisioned
by
congress
when
it
enacted
erisa,
and
that
there
is
absolutely
no
support
for
that
position.
the
trustees'
argument
that
the
cases
holding
that
302
places
restrictions
on
trust
funds
have
mistakenly
relied
on
general
equity
law
is
not
supported
from
a
reading
of
the
numerous
cases
from
all
of
the
circuits.
it
is
clear
that
the
courts
have
held
that
section
302,
because
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
concerned
that
those
persons
who
have
worked
in
contributory
employment
receive
benefits,
the
courts
have
held
that
302
does
supply
substantive
restrictions
on
the
plans
themselves.
the
trustees,
of
course,
do
not
argue
that
collective
bargaining
imposed
any
protections
on
this
class,
and
they
have
not
shown
any
way
in
which
judicial
review
would
harm
collective
bargaining.
