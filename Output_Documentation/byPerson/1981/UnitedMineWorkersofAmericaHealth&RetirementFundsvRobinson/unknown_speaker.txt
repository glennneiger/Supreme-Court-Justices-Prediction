unknown
speaker
but
it
was
bargaining,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
those
cases
are
correctly
decided?
unknown
speaker
properly
decided
under
302(c)(5)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sword,
even
though
your
opponent
concedes
that
point,
and
he
did
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
this
court
has
never
so
held,
has
it?
assume
that
discretion
was
expressly
given
to
the
trustees
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
administer
the
pension.
has
this
court
ever
held
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trustees
be
subject
to
review?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
say
anything
about
their
duties
being
reviewable
by
a
court,
the
performance
of
their
duties
being
reviewable
by
a
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
it
ever
said
that
they
are
reviewable,
is
my
question.
has
this
court
ever
said
they
are
reviewable?
how
about
amax?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
say
that
there
are
fiduciary
duties
on
trustees?
unknown
speaker
subject
to
the
supervision
of
a
court
of
equity?
unknown
speaker
so
they
are
reviewable,
their
decisions,
in
terms
of
302
standards?
unknown
speaker
well,
amax
hardly
dealt
with
the
question
of
reviewing
discretion.
that
dealt
with
the
manner
in
which
they
are
appointed.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
certainly
no
cases
around
that
say
that
the
courts
may
modify
the
eligibility
requirements.
i
mean,
that
the
trustees
may
modify
the
eligibility
requirements.
except
this
one,
maybe.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
on
that
point,
they
also
would
have
gotten
$5,000
instead
of
$2,000
in
severance
pay,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
some
of
them
would,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
are
you
contending
that
that
also
violated
the
agreement,
the
disparate
treatment,
$5,000
for
some
and
$2,000
for
others?
unknown
speaker
even
if
he
was
eligible
for
benefits?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
distinction
is
arbitrary,
the
distinction
between
the
$5,000
and
$2,000
death
benefits
is
equally
arbitrary,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
it
was
the
other
way
around,
that
the
one
who
was
the
widow
of
a
retired
miner
got
the
$5,000,
and
the
widow
of
a
pension-eligible
worker
who
still
worked...
do
i
have
it
backwards?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
question
rather
whether
it
can
immunize
it
from
judicial
review
or
whether
judicial
review
is
permissible,
or
authorized?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
to
say
that
someone
is
without
protection,
i
mean,
if
there
is
no
judicial
review.
you
have
to
point
to
some
affirmative
authority
by
which
the
courts
review
the
thing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sword,
there
really
isn't
anything,
is
there,
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
a
congressional
intent
to
set
a
substantive
standard
for
eligibility
retirements,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
every
indication
that
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
to
prevent
provision
in
the
legislation
was
to
prevent
the
union
officials
from
using
the
trust
funds
for
their
own
benefit?
isn't
that
really
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
another
reason
for
that,
too,
isn't
there?
the
people
involved
here
were
people
whose
husbands
had
died
before
the
negotiation
took
place,
so
that
i
think
it
would
be
normal
for
the
union
to
show
a
greater
interest
in
the
current
work
force.
there
would
be
no
obligation
at
all
to
provide
retroactive
benefits
for
people
who
previously
died,
would
there?
the
arbitrariness
comes
in
that
they
provided
benefits
for
some
but
not
all.
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
not
agree
that
they
could
have...
if
they
had
denied
benefits
for
all
widows
of
previously
deceased
miners,
you
would
have
no
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
say
they
denied
benefits
to
all
widows
of
deceased
miners
and
all
families
of
retired
miners.
unknown
speaker
current
workers.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
have
any
case
at
all,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
found
a
situation
in
which
they
didn't
think
they
had
enough
money
to
provide
all
the
benefits
that
they
wanted,
and
they
just
arbitrarily
said,
we
will
provide
benefits
for
the
people
in
pennsylvania,
but
not
in
ohio,
and
if
we
tried
to
do
it
equally
the
benefits
would
be
so
small
they
are
not
worth
anything,
so
we
would
rather
have
substantial
benefits
for
one
group
and
for
the
others.
i
take
it
that
would
be
illegal
under
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
purpose
always
will
be,
i
suppose,
whenever
you
deny
a
class
benefit,
you
save
a
little
money.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
sue
the
trustees,
though?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
solves
your
case
for
you
very
easily,
but
the
people
who
are
at
fault
are
the
settlors.
the
union
and
the
management.
now,
you
may
have
a
right
under
302
to
have
the
fairness
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
adjudicated,
but
i
don't
know
why
you
sue
the
trustees.
what
authority
do
they
have
to
say
they
won't
enforce
the...
or
maybe
the
trustees
could
even
have
sued
the
settlors.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
sue
the
union
and
the
management
to
have
their
agreement
declared
illegal
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
against
whom?
unknown
speaker
against
court
decisions...
maybe
court
decisions
against
the
union
and
the
management.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
the
trustees...
you
suggest
that
the
trustees
may
look
at
the
trust
agreement
and
say,
gee,
we
think
this
violates
federal
law,
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
terms
of
the
trust,
so
we
just
aren't
going
to
pay
out
the
benefits.
we
are
just
going
to
pay
them
out
as
we
see
fit.
is
that
what
you
think
they
can
do?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
wouldn't
say
they
could
act
on
their
own,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
suggest--
unknown
speaker
--well,
how
do
they
know
it
was
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
well,
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
why
do
they
have
to
take
their
word
for
the
fact
that
it
is
illegal?
unknown
speaker
well,
whose
word
do
they
take?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
they
at
least
have
to
go
to
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
they
have
to
before
they
could
vary...
disregard
the
trust
instrument?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
illegal.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
illegal.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
know
it
is
unlawful
until
somebody
decides
it?
unknown
speaker
they
would
have
to,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
the
collective
bargainers
would
say,
sorry,
but
that
is
what
we
agreed
to,
and
we
think
it
is
perfectly
fair,
and
then
the
trustees
would,
if
they
wanted
to
vary
from
the
trust
document,
would
have
to
sue.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suggest
you
sued
the
wrong
people.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
the
trustees
can
give
you
relief
by
themselves.
unknown
speaker
shown
where?
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
judge
thought
otherwise,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
he
said,
bad
bargain
or
not,
it
is
a
bargain,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
good
or
bad,
it
was
a
contract.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
union
and
management
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
some
racial
discrimination,
limited
the
benefits
to
all
blacks
or
all
whites.
would
that
be
reviewable
anywhere
in
the
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
as
a
violation
of
their
fair
representation?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
302
would
have
no
relevance
to
it?
unknown
speaker
all
of
them?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is,
there
is
no
302
remedy
for
a
situation
like
that?
that
is
your
submission?
