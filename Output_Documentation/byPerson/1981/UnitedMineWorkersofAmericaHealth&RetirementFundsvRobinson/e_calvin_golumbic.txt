mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
decided
that
the
substantive
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
embodied
in
an
employee
benefit
trust
was
subject
to
review
by
federal
courts
for
reasonableness,
under
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
provision
of
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
this
decision,
we
submit,
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
as
revealed
by
the
national
labor
laws.
the
national
labor
laws
were
based
on
private
bargaining
with
governmental
supervision
alone.
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
substantive
terms
upon
which
parties
agreed.
accordingly,
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
rejected
attempts
by
federal
courts
to
substitute
their
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
collective
bargaining
parties.
of
course,
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
collective
bargaining
parties
are
not
subject
to
unqualified
authority.
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
be
reviewed
and
revised
if
it
violates
the
constitution
or
federal
law,
but
absent
such
a
violation,
the
collective
bargaining
procedure
should
not
be
interrupted,
so
long
as
that
process
was
conducted
in
good
faith.
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
clearly
reflected
that
the
agreement
to
exclude
the
widows
and
respondent's
class
was
the
subject
of
prolonged,
intense,
and
informed
bargaining.
in
fact,
the
court
below
acknowledged
that
the--
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
--excuse
me?
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
the
issue
was
bargained
from
the
day
the
bargaining
commenced
until,
indeed,
the
parties
decided
to
agree
in
order
to
agree
to
a
final
bargaining
agreement
in
order
to
avoid
a
strike.
given
the
fact,
given
the
fact
that
the
agreement
in
this
case
was
the
result
of
good
faith
collective
bargaining,
the
court
should
have
restrained,
or
refrained
from
reviewing
it.
instead,
the
court
decided
to
become
a
party
to
the
negotiations
and
impose
its
own
view
of
a
desirable
settlement.
the
court
justifies
its
intervention
in
this
case
by
asserting
that
the
eligibility
rules
of
an
employee
benefit
trust
established
through
collective
bargaining
are
subject
to
review
for
reasonableness
pursuant
to
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
provision
in
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
court,
in
support
of
that
proposition,
the
court
relies
on
a
series
of
cases
decided
by
the
d.
c.
circuit
which
involve
acts
undertaken
by
collective
bargaining
parties...
excuse
me,
which
involve
acts
undertaken
not
by
collective
bargaining
parties,
but
by
trustees
of
employee
benefit
trusts.
these
cases
do
not
support
the
proposition
that
authority
to
review
eligibility
rules
for
reasonableness
emanates
from
section
302(c)(5).
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
i
think
those
cases
are
correctly
decided,
justice
rehnquist,
insofar...
insofar
as
they
rest
on
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
a
court
of
equity
to
review
the
discretionary
acts
of
trustees,
and
insofar
as
they
decided
that
in
those
particular
instances,
in
those
cases
the
trustees
had
abused
their
discretion.
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
the
cases
were
decided
on
the
authority
of
a
court
of
equity
to
review
the
discretionary
acts
of
trustees,
and
in
no
instance
did
the
cases
rest
on
a
jurisdictional
basis
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
such
as
section
302(c)
or
302(e).
these
cases
demonstrate
that
the
authority
to
review
in
each
of
the
cases
rested
on
the
broad
authority
of
a
court
of
equity
to
review
the
discretionary
acts
of
taft-hartley
trustees.
other
courts
also
decided
that
they
have
authority
to
review
the
discretionary
acts
of
taft-hartley
trustees,
and
these
courts
based
their
authority
on
section
302(e),
which
in
their
view
authorized
the
review
of
employee
benefit
trusts
for
a
structural
violation
of
section
302(c)(5).
the
scope
for
review
under
the
structural
violation
doctrine
remains
unsettled.
the
third
circuit
has
adopted
a
rather
broad
scope
of
review
under
the
doctrine.
the
first
circuit
has
limited
review
under
the
doctrine
to
ascertaining
whether
employee
benefit
trusts
conform
to
the
express
requirements
of
section
302(c)(5).
the
reason
for
this
diversity
of
views
on
the
scope
of
review
under
the
structural
violation
doctrine
is
apparent
when
the
structural
violation
doctrine
is
traced
to
its
origin.
virtually
every
court
which
has
adopted
a
broad
construction
of
review
under
the
doctrine
begins
with
analysis
of
section
302(c),
with
the
cases
decided
by
the
d.
c.
circuit
upon
which
the
court
below
relied.
but
as
we
have
shown,
these
cases
do
not
rest
on
an
analysis
of
section
302(c)(5),
but
rather
on
the
broad
authority
of
a
court
of
equity
to
review
the
discretionary
acts
of
trustees.
in
this
case,
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
lost
sight
of
the
equitable
origin
of
its
authority
and
decided
that
it
may
review
a
collective
bargaining
provision
for
reasonableness
under
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
provision
of
section
302(c)(5),
but
to
say
that
section
302(c)(5)
imposes
a
standard
of
reasonableness
under
which
the
courts
may
review
and
revise
the
fruits
of
collective
bargaining
is
to
ignore
the
legislative
purpose
of
congress
in
adopting
the
taft-hartley
act.
congress
adopted
the
taft-hartley
act,
among
other
things,
to
prevent
labor
unions
from
using
welfare
funds
for
their
own
purposes,
and
to
make
sure
that
those
funds
were
used
for
the
benefit
of
employees
of
contributing
employers.
it
is
apparent
therefore
that
the
requirement
in
section
302(c)(5)
that
welfare
funds
must
be
used
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
employees
was
intended
only
to
prevent
and
prohibit
the
use
of
those
funds
for
union
officials
and
other
non-employees.
it
is
equally
apparent
that
section
302(c)(5)
imposes
no
limitation
upon
the
eligibility
standards
adopted
through
collective
bargaining
for
the
payment
of
benefits
to
employees.
so
long
as
those
collectively
bargained
eligibility
standards
do
not
permit
the
payment
of
benefits
to
persons
other
than
employees,
those
standards,
we
submit,
are
not
subject
to
review
under
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
of
course,
of
course
those
standards
and
collectively
bargained
employee
benefit
plans
are
subject
to
review
for
compliance
with
erisa.
in
erisa,
congress
adopted
standards
for
employee
benefit
trusts,
including
standards
of
vesting
participation
in
funding,
standards
for
reporting
and
disclosure,
and
standards
of
fiduciary
conduct,
and
significantly,
congress
provided
that
any
violation
of
these
standards
was
subject
to
judicial
challenge
in
federal
courts.
certainly
in
enacting
this
comprehensive
legislation
governing
employee
benefit
trusts,
including
a
provision
for
the
judicial
review
of
a
violation
thereof,
congress
believes
that
it
was
filling
a
regulatory
void.
and
in
light
of
that
fact,
this...
the
existence
of
this
comprehensive
legislation
undercuts
all
arguments
for
permitting
the
judicial
review
of
collectively
bargained
employee
benefit
trusts
pursuant
to
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
i
thank
you.
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
not
necessarily,
because
the
death
benefit,
this
$5,000,
$2,000
difference
is
talking
about
a
death
benefit,
which
is
a
benefit
that
is
provided
to
the
widow
of
an
active
miner,
and
there
could
be
some
considerations
for
the
payment
of
a
larger
benefit
to
the
widow
of
someone
who
is
actively
working
at
death.
that
is
in
no
way
related
to
the--
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
it
would,
justice
white,
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
steel
and
in
howard,
as
a
violation
of
possibly
statutory
basis
upon
which
the
collective
bargaining
was
undertaken,
such
as
the
railway
labor
act,
or
it
might
be
in
violation
or
title
vii,
or
it
may
very
well
be
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
the
right
to
fair
representation
under
title
vii
and--
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
--section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act
would
merely
require
that
benefits
be
paid
to
contributing
employees,
or
to
employees
of
contributing
employers.
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
not
at
all.
in
fact,
let
me
address
my
response--
mr.
e.
calvin
golumbic
--that's
correct.
in
fact,
if
the
court
will
permit
me
in
a
few
words
to
expand
upon
my
response
to
your
question,
in
this
instance
the
exclusion
of
the
widows
from
lifetime
health
care
was
undertaken
in
good
faith
collective
bargaining,
and
the
economic
wisdom
and
judgment
of
the
collective
bargaining
parties
in
making
that
exclusion
is
not
normally
subject
to
review.
absent
a
violation
of
federal
law,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
white,
in
this
instance,
there
was
no
such
violation
of
federal
law,
although
the
court,
the
trial
court
decided
it
was
a
violation
of
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
and
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
merely
requires
that
benefits
not
be
paid
to
individuals
who
are
not
employees
of
contributing
employers.
it
does
not
impose
a
duty
upon
the
collective
bargaining
parties
to
pay
a
benefit
to
any
particular
group
of
employees
of
6
contributing
employers.
interestingly
enough,
the
respondents
argue
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
agreement
was
established
in
good
faith
collective
bargaining,
the
trustees
have
a
duty
to
modify
that
agreement
to
make
it
more
equitable.
and
may
i
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
trustees
have
no
authority
under
section
8
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
negotiate,
and
indeed,
under
section
406
of
erisa,
they
are
prohibited
from
acting
on
behalf
of
the
collective
bargaining
parties,
and
to
that
extent
the
trustees
may
not
negotiate
benefit
modifications
that
were
raised
in
collective
bargaining,
and
they
may
not
negotiate
those
benefit
modifications
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
try
to
give
effect
to
benefit
proposals
that
were
advanced
and
rejected
during
the
collective
bargaining
procedures.
to
the
contrary,
to
the
contrary,
the
trustees
under
section
404(a)(1)
of
d
of
erisa
must
comply
and
administer
the
wage
agreement
consistent
with
its
terms,
and
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
beneficiaries
designated
thereunder.
thank
you.
