mr.
john
silard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
glad
the
government
now
concedes
that
the
general
section
giving
discretion
to
the
secretary
in
the
matter
of
choosing
which
system
to
use,
which
he
read,
is
not
going
to
be
applicable
for
two
more
years,
because
we
are
now
in
the
five-year
period
where
it
is
section
8(a)(5)(b)
which
controls,
not
the
general
discussion.
when
this
full
and
fair
experimentation
required
by
this
section
is
completed
after
five
years,
the
secretary
in
his
informed
discretion
will
be
able
to
choose
which
systems
to
use
where.
but
the
point
is
that
in
section
8(a)(5)(b)
in
each
of
the
five
years
in
which
we
are
now,
the
secretary
was
commanded
to
use
these
systems;
it
says,
"the
systems
herein
shall
be
applied.
"
now,
i'm
not
a
zealot
for
plain
meaning,
but
it
says,
"the
systems
shall
be
applied",
and
it
doesn't
say
some
of
them,
or
one
of
them,
or
two
of
them.
so
i
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
i
insist
that
it
does
not
at
all
clearly
repel
he
contention
which
is
before
this
court,
which
is
essentially
this--
mr.
john
silard
--i
will
come
to
it
in
a
moment,
your
honor.
that's
an
annual
provision.
it
doesn't
imply--
mr.
john
silard
--it
does,
but
i
think
that's
an
annual...
there's
no
implication
there
that
the
secretary
can
cast
out
completely
for
the
whole
five-year
period
not
only
one
system
but
all
three
of
the
nonbonus
systems.
mr.
john
silard
the
reporting
of
that
on
an
annual
basis
is
the
one
best
inference
the
government
has,
but
i
think
the
material
i'm
going
to
give
you
will
show
you
to
be
erroneous.
there
are
eight
separate
times
in
the
legislative
history
where
three
times
the
senate,
three
times
the
house,
and
twice
the
conference
committee
said
these
systems
shall
be
used,
which
is
consonant
with
the
language
"will
be
used".
i'm
going
to
touch
on
them
very
briefly,
because
they
are
in
our
opinion
dispositive,
before
we
get
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
is
being
totally
frustrated
here
by
the
use
of
the
systems
that
are
least
likely
to
advance
competition
and
revenues.
first
of
all,
the
senate
committee
said...
and
this
is
on
page
15
in
our
brief...
that
the
bill
"authorizes"--
mr.
john
silard
--page
15.
mr.
john
silard
the
bill
"authorizes
new
leasing
systems
and
requires
their
use
on
an
experimental
basis.
"
later
on
in
the
same
page
it
says
that
"in
order
to
assure
that
these
alternatives
will
be
used.
"
--assure
that
they
will
be
used...
the
parameters
are
placed
in
the
statute.
on
page
16
the
committee
concludes
again
with
respect
to
those
parameters
that
these
limitations
are
included
to
assure
that
the
new
leasing
systems
would
be
tried.
so
the
senate
was
perfectly
clear,
but
the
house--
mr.
john
silard
--right.
well,
we
come--
mr.
john
silard
--well,
it's
clear
at
least
it
includes
some
of
the
nonbonus
systems.
that
becomes
clear
from
the
next
three
citations.
mr.
john
silard
perhaps
it
implies
not
all,
but
now
take
a
look
at
what--
mr.
john
silard
--well,
i
would
say
the
fairest
reading
is
it's
all,
but
the
case
doesn't
turn
on
that.
the
case
turns
on
this
issue:
can
he
totally
reject
the
nonbonus
alternatives?
and
that's
what
it
makes
clear.
mr.
john
silard
i
have
two
arguments.
one,
i
think
yes.
mr.
john
silard
yes.
i
would
say
initially
yes,
but
if
no,
as
an
alternative
at
least
some
of
the
nonbonus
systems
have
to
be
used
because
the
committees
expressly
said
so,
if
i
may
read
the
citation,
your
honor,
addressing
this.
on
page
18,
"it
was
the
intention
of
the
committee
that
there
be
a
clear
mandate
given
to
the
secretary
to
require
him
to
use
bidding
systems
other
than
the
cash
bonus
bid.
"
and
by
that
they
meant
that
he
had
to
use
some
of
the
non-cash
bonus
systems,
because
two
paragraphs
later,
still
on
page
18,
they
say
by
random
selection
"of
those
areas
to
be
offered
under
a
bonus
bid
system
and
those
which
would
be
offered
under
a
nonbonus
bid
system.
"
the
purpose
would
be
advanced.
and
they
finish
up
again
saying
this
is
a
"mandating
use
of
new
systems,
to
insure
they
are
tested
and
studied.
"
i
want
to
make
an
apology.
on
page
19
i
forgot
to
give
a
very
important
additional
reference
from
the
conference
report.
there
are
so
many
of
these
that
it
dropped
out,
although
it
was
in
my
opposition
to
cert.--
on
page
92
of
the
conference
report
under
the
heading
"mandate
on
use
of
bidding
systems.
"
the
conference
report
says
"bidding
systems
other
than
bonus
bidding
are
to
be
utilized.
"
that's
the
language.
and
then
it
goes
on--
mr.
john
silard
--well,
that's
clear
from
the
rest
of
the
text
on
page
19,
your
honor,
if
you
will
look
at
it.
here's
what
they
say.
in
the
same
paragraph
the
conference
committee
says
this...
and
i
will
rest
my
case
on
this
conference
extract
on
the
legislative
history,
if
nothing
else.
it
says
the
followings.
"although
there
is
no
requirement
for
random
selection.
"
--this
is
page
19
of
our
brief...
"the
secretary,
in
setting
forth
systems
for
use
shall
seek
to
secure
a
fair
selection
of
different
methods
on
different
tracts.
"
"the
purpose
of
such
a
selection
is
to
assure
that
adequate
information
is
obtained
as
to
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
various
bidding
systems,
including
the
front-end
bonus
bid
systems.
"
now,
the
way
the
government
reads
this,
congress
might
just
as
well
have
put
the
word
"only"
in
here,
including
only
the
front-end
bonus
bid
systems,
because
that's
how
they
are
reading
this
statute.
and
yet
to
insert
the
word
"only"
including
the
front-end
bonus
bid
systems
is
to
invert
the
meaning
of
this
completely.
the
very
point
that
congress
is
making
and
the
house
committee
was
making
was
we
want
to
compare
the
benefits
of
the
nonbonus
bidding
systems
where
this
big
cash
barrier
which
has
prevented
competition
and
returns
to
the
united
states
for
25
years
has
become
the
problem.
let's
see
how
those
work
which
continued
to
use
that
in
some
fashion,
and
compare
them
to
those
that
don't
use
that
in
any
fashion.
that
was
the
whole
point,
and
it's
been
totally
destroyed
by
the
reluctance
of
the
secretary.
mr.
john
silard
no.
i
rest
my
entire
reading
of
the
legislative
references
on
the
mandate
to
experiment
on
this.
my
entire
case,
your
honor,
rests
on
a
completely
different
proposition
which
was
invoked
against
this
very
agency
this
year
earlier
in
this
court's
decision
written
by
powell.
this
court
has
never
consciously
construed
a
statute
in
a
way
as
it's
being
asked
to
be
construed
by
the
government
here
which
totally
frustrates
its
central
purpose.
that
frustration
of
its
central
purpose
is
clear.
on
page
16
of
our
brief
and
on
page
17
of
our
brief
and
on
page
15
we
quote
the
central
purpose
from
the
legislative
reports.
the
senate
said
the
new
systems
are
designed
to
reduce
the
front-end
cash
bonus--
mr.
john
silard
--middle
of
page
15.
the
senate
report
said
that
the
experiment
is
designed
to
reduce
the
front-end
cash
bonus
and
increase
the
government's
return
on
actual
production.
the
house,
on
page
17,
said
almost
exactly
the
same
thing:
"to
increase
competition
for
offshore
leases
and
secure
higher
returns
to
the
public
treasury.
"
the
section
has
been
amended,
et
cetera.
so
the
whole
point
of
the
experiment
was
can
we
use
systems
where
there
will
be
more
competition.
now,
there
are
five
gao
reports
that
are
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
all
issued
between
'73
and
'78.
mr.
john
silard
well,
the
following
sentence
says,
"the
secretary
is
required
to
choose
the
new
bidding
system.
"
so
i
don't
think
the
language
is
the
answer.
the
answer
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
controlling
here.
mr.
john
silard
i'm
saying
that
the
purpose
of
the
congress
has
never
been
clearer
than
in
these
amendments.
over
and
over
again
the
reports
say
that
front-end
cash
bonus
prevents
adequate
competition.
the
five
gao
reports
which
are
in
the
record
and
which
are
cited
by
the
congressional
committees
all
said
we
have
too
few
bids
under
these
cash
bonuses...
we
have
like
two
and
three
bids
per
tract
over
the
last
25
years...
to
know
that
we're
getting
a
fair
return.
no
one
knows
how
much
this
gas
and
oil
is
worth;
so
unless
we
have
active
competition
for
the
bids,
we
have
no
assurance
at
all
the
government
is
getting
anything
like
their
fair
return.
that
was
the
central
purpose
here,
more
bidding
by
our
system
which
will
guarantee
better
return
if
it's
a
cash
bonus
system,
or
better
returns
through
high
royalties
and
profit
shares
such
as
california
gets
if
we
use
that
other
system.
now,
it's
totally
frustrated
by
what's
happened.
appendix
a
to
our
brief
shows
that
in
the
last
three
years
the
exclusive
use
of
variance
of
bonus
bidding
has
produced
no
advance
whatever
in
the
competition
and
revenue
objectives
of
the
statute.
but
you
need
not
take
it
from
me.
i
have
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
the
answer
to
three
congressional
questions
given
by
the
secretary
three
week
ago.
and
in
his
answers
to
jones
and
hubbard
question
7...
those
are
congressmen...
and
lent
and
forsythe
question
14,
and
his
answer
to
lent
and
forsythe
question
15,
the
secretary
three
times
says
the
new
systems
we
tried
are
a
failure.
they
have
not
promoted
competition.
there
is
no
reduction
of
the
bonuses.
we've
had
no
gain
at
all.
so
i
think
a
more
candid
answer
that
the
solicitor
general
may
have
made
is
that
the
secretary
now
says
we
have
gotten
nowhere,
which
is
also
clear
from
appendix
a,
over
the
last
three
years
by
using
the
bonus
bidding
varieties.
and
that's
obvious.
the
whole
problem
that
congress
was
addressing
was
these
big
bonuses
prevent
an
adequate
number
of
bidders,
and
with
so
few
bids
we
don't
know
that
we're
getting
a
market
in
which
we're
getting
a
fair
return.
when
you
continue
to
reject
the
nonbonus
three
options
that
congress
specified
and
use
only
the
bonus
options
congress
specified,
you
have
debilitated
yourself
from
the
fair
experiment
which
was
intended
to
compare
one
system
against
the
other.
you
get
no
results,
as
the
secretary
now
concedes,
you
get
no
gain
whatever,
and
you
won't
use
a
system
which
california
has
used
for
30
years
with
good
effect
and
seems
to
do
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
and
it
was
one
of
the
systems
in
here.
now--
mr.
john
silard
--yes,
your
honor,
except
i
wish
to
say
this.
if
there
is
one
issue
that
is
not
before
you
with
any
problem
in
it
it's
the
standing
issue.
congress
said
the
principal
problem
with
what
we're
doing
now
is
it
doesn't
get
enough
bids
and
enough
revenue.
let's
try
new
systems,
must
try
new
systems,
in
our
view,
which
give
a
promise
of
more
bids,
more
competition
and
more
revenue.
those
are
the
goals
i
just
read
from
the
statute.
no
question
about
it.
now,
in
the
frustration
of
that
goal
by
the
refusal
to
test
the
more
promising
systems
that
could
do
this
job,
california
is
losing
millions
of
dollars.
california
is
a
participant
in
federal
revenues
and
in
leases
right
off
its
shore
that
take
place
almost
every
year.
there
was
one
a
month
after
the
suit
was
filed,
there
was
one
this
summer,
another
one
scheduled
for
next
year.
and
when
the
five-year
experimental
period
ends,
and
this
is
supposed
to
give
us
information
down
the
road
ahead,
they're
going
to
be
lots
more
leases
in
which
california
under
this
statute
has
a
legal
interest
in
the
federal
revenues.
it's
an
involuntary
partner,
in
effect,
in
drainage
situations.
it
owns
one
side
of
the
drainage
pool
of
gas
and
oil
which
is
pumped
out
on
the
federal
land
by
the
federal
lessee.
so
the
statute
says
you,
mr.
california,
will
get
your
share
by
a
division
of
these
revenues.
now,
how
could
california
have
a
more
intimate
stake
in
compliance
with
this
statute
which
sought
to
increase
revenues.
the
solicitor
general
said
the
first
purpose
of
the
statute,
he
said
to
you
this
morning,
is
to
increase
revenues
by
these
experiments.
so
how
could
california
not
have
an
intimate
stake
in
carrying
out
that
purpose
through
good
faith
experimentation?
it
clearly
has.
it
stands
to
gain
millions
of
dollars
with
the
federal
government
on
every
sale,
billions
perhaps,
if
the
government
complies
with
what
congress
intended.
in
other
words--
mr.
john
silard
--may
i
just
finish
the
thought?
the
congressional
objective,
your
honor,
the
principle
congressional
objective
to
increase
leasing
revenues
is
one
in
which
california
as
a
co-partner
has
a
most
obvious
stake
which
gives
it
standing.
mr.
john
silard
that
argument,
your
honor,
is
essentially
a
refusal
to
accept
the
premise
on
which
congress
enacted
the
statute.
the
congress
said
let's
test
these
systems
to
find
the
one
that
will
give
us
the
best
revenue,
the
assumption
being
that
we
have
good
faith
experimentation
that
gives
us
the
answer
to
that;
a
sane
secretary
of
the
interior
not
dominated
by
oil
company
considerations
will
use
the
systems
that
maximize
revenue.
that's
the
whole
point.
so
i
think
to
say
that
an
ornery
secretary
could
do
this
experimentation,
discover,
as
california
has
discovered,
that
profit-sharing
gets
much
better
results
than
the
cash
bonus
system,
but
then
just
quixotically
say
well,
in
the
next
30
years
i
don't
like
that
system;
i'm
not
going
to
use
it.
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
impossible
that
if
this
experiment
were
conducted
and
succeeded
a
secretary
might
still
kick
it
in
the
garbage
can.
that
might
be
an
interesting
next
litigation.
but
the
premise
on
which
the
government
is
arguing
is
essentially
a
recitation
of
the
whole
premise
for
the
experimental
program,
that
we
have
secretaries
who
are
intelligent
men
who
will
use
a
successful
experiment
and
then
use
the
best
of
the
systems
that
yield
the
best
revenue.
so
congress
is
assuming
that
the
function
of
this
five-year
experimentation
is
to
give
the
secretary
an
informed
discretion
at
the
end
of
the
five
years
to
use
the
best
system.
and
i
think
we
have
to
assume
a
very
high
likelihood
that
if
he
does
what
congress
mandated
and
clearly
wanted
to
do
here,
and
the
california
system
proves
as
effective
in
use
here
as
it
does
for
california,
that
in
all
likelihood
he
will
then
use
that
system
then,
perhaps
not
on
every
sale
but
on
a
substantial
number
of
sales.
i
might
say
one
other
thing,
your
honor.
there
is
not
just
injury
here;
there
is
insult.
this
is
california's
own
oil
which
is
being
pumped
out
by
a
federal
lessee.
california
is
helpless
here.
it
would
love
to
have
the
federal
government
use
the
more
lucrative,
more
beneficial
system
it's
been
using
for
40
years
on
this
oil.
mr.
john
silard
this
co-leasing,
your
honor,
took
place
this
summer,
and
two
years
ago,
and
next
year.
it's
an
involuntary
co-leasing.
under
the
statute
where
there's
a
drainage
situation
and
the
federal
government
owns
one
side
of
the
pool
on
one
side
of
the
three-mile
line
and
california
on
the
other,
california
must
accept
a
portion
of
the
federal
lease
revenues
as
its
share
for
its
own
oil
which
is
being
pumped
out.
now,
if
it
cannot
agree
on
how
much
it
should
get,
then
the
federal
district
court
is
to
decide
what
the
fair
share
is.
but
the
point
is
the
pie
which
is
being
split
could
be,
as
congress
anticipated,
a
much
better
pie,
not
only
for
the
federal
government
and
the
state
of
california,
if,
as
congress
anticipated,
we
would
use
the
systems
which
give
promise
of
more
competition
and
more
returns.
mr.
john
silard
no.
he
said
california
has
not
gone
heavily
into
leasing
its
own
new
leases.
it's
pumping
oil
now
from
leases
in
'48,
'50
and
'68.
mr.
john
silard
oh,
under
this
federal
statute
it
has
a
legal
interest
in
the
federal
revenues
because
it's
an
involuntary
participant
and
shares
in
them.
if
that's
not
a
legal
interest
that
entities
it
to
say
mr.
secretary,
you
must
carry
through
the
experimentation
which
congress
hoped
would
increase
these
revenues
both
for
the
federal
government
and
for
us,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
and
i
may
say
it's
not
small
potatoes.
mr.
john
silard
there's
a
billion
dollars
on
deposit
for
california
from
just
these
last
two
drainage
sales.
i
found
that
in
a
collection
of
responses
that
the
solicitor
general
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
made
three
weeks
ago
by
the
secretary
to
the
congress.
mr.
john
silard
whatever
the
revenue
are,
whatever
comes
in,
california
divides.
mr.
john
silard
certainly,
but
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
penny-wise,
pound-foolish
policy
that
congress
found
that
after
25
years
was
minimizing
real
federal
revenues,
because
when
there's
a
big
discovery
and
the
federal
government
gets
12
percent
or
16
percent
of
the
revenue,
whereas
california,
for
instance,
gets
48
percent
net
share
of
the
revenue,
it's
just
a
terrible
deal.
of
course,
every
administration
wants
that
cash
up
front
to
balance
this
year's
or
last
year's
budget.
i
understand
why
administration
after
administration
has
refused
to
do
what
congress
wants,
made
very
clear.
let's
get
the
total
revenue
in
here,
even
it's
down
the
line;
then
it's
a
fair
share.
they
want
the
cash
up
front,
some
other
administration
they
don't
care
much
about.
but
congress
was--
mr.
john
silard
--i
suppose,
one,
because
they
have
confidence
that
our
litigation
would
succeed
without
their
presence.
[laughter]
there's
a
certain
immodesty
in
that,
but
i
will
say
that--
i
will
say
that
a
unanimous
court
of
appeals
found
what
i
am
arguing,
that
the
central
purpose
of
this
statute
is
being
frustrated
by
the
refusal
to
use
any
of
the
three
nonbonus
bid
systems.
mr.
john
silard
oh,
there
are.
we've
had
letters
from
oil
companies.
mr.
john
silard
well,
there
are
oil
companies,
certainly
gas
companies.
a
lot
of
them
testified
in
the
congressional
hearings
that
this
front-end
bonus
is
the
whole
problem,
and
congress
accepted
it;
that
if
we
had
a
looser
system...
and
by
the
way,
the
gas
companies
do
get
into
the
bidding
when
they're
not
precluded
by
the
cash
bonus.
alaska
tried
profit
share
bidding
only
last
year,
and
the
gas
companies
were
there
and
there
were
good
results
in
alaska.
so
this
is
a
system
that
can
work.
mr.
john
silard
no
one--
mr.
john
silard
--on
the
drilling
costs
and
exploration
costs
no
one
has
factors,
but
we
do
have
in
the
record
i
think
what
is
partially
the
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens.
what
happened
was
that
in
the
sixties
few
leases
were
let,
prices
were
stable,
and
the
property
that
was
being
let
was
relatively
known
or
there
was
a
pretty
good
hunch
as
to
what
was
there.
the
result
was
that
the
government
realized
about
35
percent...
this
is
all
in
the
record...
35
percent
net
of
the
gas
and
oil
that
was
discovered
with
a
combination
of
the
cash
bonus
and
the
16
percent
royalty.
in
other
words,
the
16
percent
royalty
represented
about
half
of
the
income
and
the
cash
bonus
about
the
other
half.
what
happened
since
is
in
the
seventies
we
started
going
into
less
known
properties,
we
started
selling
a
lot
more
of
it,
and
the
result
was
that
the
competition
level
went
down
further;
but
the
really
important
result
was
that
the
cash
bonuses,
while
they
kept
going
up
with
inflation
and
all,
started
losing
significance
vis-a-vis
the
net
result
in
a
radical
way.
so
that
as
of
the
last
three
years
in
the
seventies,
the
cash
bonus
was
adding
only
6
percent
to
the
16
percent
royalty.
we
were
now
getting...
the
federal
government
has
been
getting
22
percent--
mr.
john
silard
--no.
it
may
vary
greatly
depending
upon
the--
mr.
john
silard
--not
only
doesn't
tell
us,
it
would
vary
greatly
with
the
tract
depending
on
difficulty,
number
of
drills,
or
results.
but
what
congress
was
persuaded
of,
and
this
is
the
core
of
the
congressional
purpose
here,
congress
was
persuaded
that
the
cash
bonus...
said
so
over
and
over
again...
the
upfront
cash
bonus
is
anticompetitive.
senator
jackson
said
so,
the
house
chairman
said
so.
it's
preventing
us
from
getting
an
adequate
competition
level;
it's
squeezing
out
all
but
the
biggest
bidders
in
the
acquisition
of
the
properties;
and
worst
of
all
it
leaves
us
with
no
assurance
that
the
government's
getting
a
fair
share.
here
are
high
stake
gamblers
gambling
for
unknown
property
values,
and
only
two
or
three
of
them
get
into
the
gamble,
and
who
knows
what
the
government
really
should
get.
mr.
john
silard
no,
your
honor,
i
hope
not
for
this
reason.
the
issue
here
isn't
what
the
oil
companies
are
doing
or
not
doing.
the
issue
is
this:
the
secretary
was
commanded
to
experiment
with
a
system
that
would
maximize
revenue,
and
he's
not
doing
so.
they
concede
that
was
the
purpose.
the
state
of
california
has
an
intimate
legal
interest
in
the
success
of
that
mandated
experiment,
because
its
revenues,
if
the
government
now
uses
a
different
leasing
system
which
does
show
a
better
result...
for
instance,
california's
own
system...
its
stake
is
in
a
vast
increase
in
its
share
of
the
federal
revenues
by
the
use
of
the
new
system.
that
doesn't
depend
on
what
oil
companies
do.
the
hundred
dollar
question
is
simply
this:
when
you
have
a
substance
of
almost
unknown
but
potentially
vast
riches,
gas
and
oil
under
the
ocean,
isn't
it
sensible
to
relate
the
government's
and
california's
stake
in
what
comes
out
of
there
fairly
directly
to
the
gas
and
oil
that's
discovered,
instead
of
putting
everything
in
an
upfront,
blind
man's
gamble
upfront
where
very
few
high
bidders,
high
rollers
can
play
the
game,
very
few
play
the
game,
and
the
net
result
is
a
devastating
loss
in
competition
and
in
revenues.
i
would
like
to
conclude
on
this
score,
your
honor.
mr.
john
silard
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
would
argue
that
the
words
"shall
be
applied"
are
words
of
common
english
meaning.
mr.
john
silard
absolutely.
the
words
"shall
be
applied"
should
be
read,
but
we
don't
have
to--
mr.
john
silard
--well,
certainly
the
legislative
history
doesn't
relieve
him
of
the
duty
to
reject
all
the
nonbonus
ones
because
that
was
the
history--
mr.
john
silard
--yes,
i
would
say
first
the
legislative
history
says
this
is
a
five-year
limited
experiment.
there
are
lots
of
leases
each
year.
you've
got
to
make
some
test
of
each
of
these
six
systems.
mr.
john
silard
right.
if
i
lose...
don't
have
to
win--
mr.
john
silard
--yes.
alternatively.
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
at
the
very
least
he
must
use
some
of
the
nonbonus
systems,
because
otherwise
the
whole
purpose
they
stated,
to
compare
one
against
the
other,
can't
be
met.
mr.
john
silard
yes,
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
it
doesn't
mean
that,
but
it
would
still
mean
that
since
the
ultimate
purpose
was
to
test
the
systems
that
can
promote
competition
and
revenue,
and
it
is
even
conceded
by
the
secretary
that
all
these
variants
of
bonus
bidding
haven't
achieved
that--
mr.
john
silard
--well,
if
i
were
your
honor
addressed
by
this
question,
i
would
find
it
unnecessary
to
address
the
question
whether
the
secretary
in
the
five
years
must
use
all
six
systems,
because
it's
enough...
and
that's
what
our
complaint
is
about
here,
your
honor...
that
he
won't
use
any
of
the
non-bonus
bidding
systems.
and
this
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
are
both
so
clear
that
against
that
kind
of
a
result,
this
court...
i
won't
read
it,
partly
because
i've
lost
it
and
partly
because
my
eyesight
is
bad...
but
the
most
wonderful
sentence
from
judge
learned
hand
which
was
quoted
against
this
very
agency
by
this
court
in
its
decision
earlier
this
year
bears
recollection.
i
think
i
did
find
it
and
my
eyeglasses
notwithstanding,
i
will
read
just
one
sentence
that
justice
powell
quoted
against
this
department
in
watt
against
alaska
this
year
when
he
said,
"it
must
be
remembered
that
statutes
always
have
some
purpose
or
object
to
accomplish
whose
sympathetic
and
imaginative
discovery
is
the
surest
guide
to
their
meaning.
"
now,
i
think
the
object
of
this
statute
is
crystal
clear
from
the
history:
test
the
systems
that
will
give
us
more
competition
and
more
revenue.
the
frustration
of
that
object
is
clear
from
appendix
a
to
our
brief
and
from
the
three
quotations
which
i've
left
with
the
clerk
to
be
lodged
with
the
court,
make
clear
that
it's
just
been
knocked
into
the
wastebasket
and
we're
getting
no
progress.
mr.
john
silard
no,
but
congress
has
been
also
watching
this
lawsuit
and
knew
as
of
last
fall
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
that
we
are
right,
and
i
think
hopes,
as
i
hope,
that
this
court
will
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
frustration
of
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
statute
is
so
clear
here,
never
mind
the
specific
history
which
i've
read,
that
the
secretary
should
be
required
in
the
remaining
two
years...
and
this
is
an
emergent
matter...
to
make
some,
some
experimental
resort
to
some
of
the
nonbonus
systems.
that's
the
only
way
to
carry
through
the
underlying
objective
of
this
statute,
because
the
ridiculous
situation
is
that
congress
identified
the
cash
bonus
as
a
problem,
said
you
shall
experiment
with
three
cash
bonus
and
three
non-cash
bonus
systems.
the
secretary
in
an
ornery
fashion
insists
on
trying
those
systems
least
likely
to
solve
the
problem,
because
they
still
use
the
cash
bonus,
and
all
of
a
sudden
suggests
that
the
other
one
is
somehow
a
terrible
system
that
cannot
be
used.
the
one
rationale
he
gives
for
not
using
the
california
system
which
has
been
so
successful
in
effect
is
that
there
may
be
underproduction.
but
in
section
8(a)(3)
congress
already
addressed
that
very
point,
and
on
page
35
of
our
brief
we
quote
the
legislative
history
where
it
says
to
solve
the
problem
of
possible
underproduction
on
the
very
high
profit
share
bids
as
the
lease
starts
yielding
less
oil
and
gas,
the
secretary
can
reduce
or
remove
the
profit
share
completely.
so
congress
actually
already
addressed
the
complaint
the
secretary
is
making
about
using
or
testing
the
california
leasing
system.
we
live
in
a
world
where
there
are
theories
and
realities.
the
reality
is
that
almost
the
biggest
state
of
this
union
for
30
years
has
had
successful
resort
to
the
profit
share
system,
which
is
the
one
congress
most
hoped
would
turn
the
trick
for
the
federal
government,
which
is
the
one
that
the
secretary
absolutely
refuses
to
test,
and
by
so
doing,
in
our
opinion,
if
we
may
submit,
it
is
frustrating
not
only
the
great
public
policy
which
was
achieved
at
great
agony
in
the
congress
after
two
successive
efforts
and
after
25
years
of
patience,
after
25
years
congress
said
all
this
discretion
has
to
end;
we're
going
to
test
for
five
years
in
a
meaningful
way
to
compare
this
system
with
that
system.
well,
the
secretary
is
comparing
apples
with
apples,
whereas
congress
said
compare
the
apples
with
the
oranges.
and
it's
not
surprising
but
it's
sad,
and
both
because
of
the
public
interest
and
the
consumer
interest
and
california's
direct
financial
stake
in
this
controversy,
we
suggest,
your
honors,
that
the
court's
decision
be
that
the
law
should
be
affirmed.
and
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
of
me,
i
think
i
will
probably
rest
on
judge
learned
hand
and
hope
that
this
court
will
give
a
reading
to
this
statute
which
gives
vitality
to
what
congress
wanted
and
made
clear,
rather
than
one
which
defeats
the
obvious
intent
of
the
congress
to
give
a
new
lice
on
leafing...
a
new
life
to
leasing...
that
pays
me
back
for
trying
puns
at
the
end
of
an
argument...
but
it
was
to
be
new
life
to
leasing
that
was
to
be
given,
and
it
is
being
killed
by
the
secretary's
absolute
refusal
to
test
the
nonbonus
bidding
system.
thank
you.
