mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
federal
oil
and
gas
leasing
program
on
the
outer
continental
shelf;
that
is
to
say,
the
zone
of
the
seabed
offshore
more
than
three
or
nine
miles
of
that
belt
which
was
conceded
to
the
coastal
states
in
1953.
as
the
court
knows,
beyond
that
state
belt
the
united
states
has
the
exclusive
right
to
exploit
the
mineral
resources
of
the
shelf.
and
since
the
enactment
of
the
outer
continental
shelfs
act
in
1953
it
has
done
this
by
granting
leases
to
private
oil
companies.
those
leases
are
granted,
or
sold
as
the
term
is,
at
auction
on
the
basis
of
sealed
bids
submitted
simultaneously
for
specified
tracts
within
a
defined
area
of
the
shelf.
no
one
knows
in
advance
how
many
bidders
there
will
be
on
any
particular
tract.
in
normal
course
the
highest
bidder
wins
that
lease.
now,
traditionally
federal
oil
and
gas
leases
have
resulted
in
three
forms
of
revenue
to
the
federal
government
quite
beside
taxes:
first,
the
so-called
cash
bonus,
which
is
paid
at
the
outset
for
the
privilege
of
the
lease;
secondly,
an
annual
rental
paid
for
the
primary
term;
and
finally,
if
there
is
production,
a
so-called
royalty
or
percentage
of
the
value,
the
gross
value
of
the
minerals
actually
extracted.
until
1978
the
law
permitted
only
two
forms
of
bidding
systems
for
federal
lands
on
the
shelf.
the
first
was
bidding
on
the
amount
of
the
initial
bonus,
the
rental
and
the
royalty
being
fixed
in
advance.
the
second
system
was
bidding
on
the
royalty
rate,
in
this
case
the
amount
of
the
bonus
and
the
annual
rental
being
fixed
in
advance.
the
choice
which
of
these
two
systems
to
use
was
entirely
left
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
for
the
first
20
years,
between
1954
and
1974,
leases
were
invariably
granted
or
offered
on
the
basis
of
the
so-called
cash
bonus
system
with
a
fixed
royalty
of
one-sixth.
that
is
what
we
refer
to
as
the
traditional
bidding
system;
indeed,
as
i
say,
it
had
lasted
invariably
for
20
years.
beginning
in
1974
and
for
the
four
ensuing
years
there
were
a
substantial
number
of
tracts
offered
under
variants
of
that
system.
the
royalty
was
sometimes
fixed
at
one-third
instead
of
one-sixth;
or
it
was
fixed
on
a
sliding
scale,
varying
between
one-sixth
and
one-half
depending
on
the
volume
and
value
of
oil
or
gas
extracted
during
a
given
quarter;
or
finally,
in
a
few
cases,
the
leases
were
offered
on
the
basis
of
royalty
bidding
with
a
fixed
bonus
per
acre.
but
the
traditional
formula,
that
is,
the
cash
bonus
with
the
one-sixth
royalty,
remained
the
norm.
however,
in
1978,
effective
in
mid-september
of
that
year,
the
congress
enacted
amendments
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
and
that
is
what
provoked
the
present
lawsuit.
most
relevantly,
the
congress
provided
for
new
bidding
systems
not
previously
authorized.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
secretary
of
energy
is
required
under
these
amendments
to
promulgate
regulations
for
each
of
those
new
authorized
bidding
systems,
and
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
required
to
actually
use
each
of
those
new
bidding
systems,
notwithstanding
that
both
secretaries
may
have
determined
that
one
or
more
of
those
systems
is
not
in
the
public
interest
or
does
not
further
the
statutory
objectives.
there
is
also
a
threshold
question.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
statutory
objections
were
listed
as
several,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
primarily
to
maximize
the
revenue
to
the
federal
government
and
to
assure
that
production
was
at
its
highest
level
consistent
with--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--there
was
an
objective
to
increase
competition.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
was.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
was,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
suppose
that
those
objectives
were
intended
to
further
the
ultimate
objectives
of
increasing
revenues
and
increasing
production
consistent
with
efficient
operations,
consistent
also
with
environmental
concerns
which
are
specified
in
the
law
as
among
the
objectives.
as
i
say,
there
is
also
a
threshold
question
which
is
whether
the
particular
plaintiffs
in
this
suit,
the
respondents
before
this
court,
have
standing
to
complain
about
the
action
or
nonaction
of
the
two
secretaries,
those
plaintiffs
being
the
california
lands
commission,
which
has
charge
of
state
leasing
on
the
shelf,
the
city
of
long
beach,
which
as
a
matter
of
california
law
has
certain
privileges
with
respect
to
the
area
adjacent
to
that
city;
and
secondly,
a
group
of
consumer
groups
and
others
who
claim
standing
because
they're
affected
by
the
bidding
systems
insofar
as
they
affect
price
and
supply
of
oil.
now,
as
cases
go
this
one
has
proceeded
fairly
swiftly
to
this
court,
but
the
procedural
history
is
nevertheless
too
complex
to
detail
in
the
time
available.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
government
sides
with
the
court
of
appeal
in
this
respect:
the
court
took
the
view
that
since
it
was
reviewing
the
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
it
plainly
had
jurisdiction
of
the
case,
and
that
since
the
issues
were
pure
issues
of
law,
notwithstanding
the
finding
of
the
district
judge
that
they
were
disputed
issues
of
fact,
the
court
could,
while
entertaining
the
case
on
the
review
of
the
denial
of
preliminary
injunction,
reach
the
other
issues
in
the
case,
as
it
did.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
effect,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
having
the
case,
having,
in
our
view,
correctly
determined
that
there
were
no
outstanding
issues
of
fact,
considering
the
statutory
injunction
to
the
courts
to
resolve
these
controversies
without
undue
delay,
the
court
concluded,
it
seemed
to
us
fairly,
that
it
ought
not
remand,
direct
the
entry
of
one
or
the
other
motion
and
then
take
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment.
now,
i
couldn't
possibly
do
justice
to
the
complaint
in
this
case.
it
is
printed
in
the
appendix
and
takes
some
82
pages,
not
to
mention
45
pages
of
appendices
attached
to
it.
mr.
justice
white
has
already
indicated
that
the
case
arises
on
the
second
appeal
on
the
denial
of
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
on
the
denial
of
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
there
had
been
a
previous
appeal
from
the
denial
of
another
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
the
suit
was
originally
aimed
at
a
particular
lease
sale.
efforts
were
made
to
abort
that
sale.
when
the
sale
nevertheless
took
place
because
the
district
judge
declined
to
enjoin
it,
an
appeal
was
taken.
that
first
appeal,
resulting
in
an
opinion
by
the
late
judge
leventhal,
pointed
out,
among
other
things,
in
denying
the
appeal
that
congress
had
in
this
instance
imposed
a
degree
of
legislative
oversight
that
was
perhaps
sufficient
to
protect
the
public
interest
without
a
need
for
the
court
to
intervene.
on
this
final
appeal
from
which
our
petition
for
certiorari
is
taken,
the
court
of
appeal
first
denied
the
preliminary
injunction
but
then
in
most
respects
held
in
favor
of
the
respondents
before
this
court.
at
least
this
much
can
be
said
for
that
decision,
which
is
not
in
all
respects
unambiguous:
it
directed
the
secretary
of
energy
on
a
schedule
set
out
by
the
court
to
promulgate
regulations
for
at
least
two
of
the
optional
bidding
systems
now
provided
under
the
amendments.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
we
compute
it,
there
are
ten
new
systems,
not
to
mention
those
which
could
be
invented.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
ten
altogether.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
are,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
having
to
choose
between
the
time
available
and
the
arguments
that
seem
most
important
to
make,
i
would
rely
on
our
brief
which
i
think
fully
covers
the
question
of
standing.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so,
justice
rehnquist,
though
i
would
carry
it
one
step
further.
it's
hard
to
see
where
their
interest
lies.
the
state
and
the
city,
so
far
as
we're
aware,
are
not
and
have
not
been
leasing
their
own
areas
since
1968
at
the
most
recent.
there
is
no
indication
that
they're
about
to
do
so
now,
so
that
as
competitors
it's
not
easy
to
see
their
advantage
or
their
disadvantage
from
any
bidding
system
the
united
states
may
use
further
offshore.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
quite
agree,
justice
brennan,
that
if
either
group
has
standing,
one
needn't
be
concerned
about
the
other
group.
one
more
word
about
california
and
the
city,
the
thrust
of
this
case
is
that
the
federal
bidding
system
discourages
most
potential
bidders
because
the
front-end
bonus
allows
only
the
largest
companies
to
participate.
logically
that
should
leave
a
great
number
of
potential
bidders
who
are
ready
and
willing
to
engage
in
leasing
on
the
shelf
who
therefore
could
take
up
state
leases
if
any
were
offered.
none
have
been
offered
for
more
than
a
decade.
turning
to
the
merits,
if
i
may,
and
focusing
on
the
provision
of
section
1337
as
it's
shown
at
the
bottom
of
page
101a,
which
is
in
the
statute;
it's
an
amendment
to
section
8(a)(1)(1)
of
the
outer
continental
shelfs
act.
it
reads,
"the
secretary
is
authorized
to
grant
to
the
highest
responsible
qualified
bidder
or
bidders
by
competitive
bidding,
under
regulations
promulgated
in
advance,
any
oil
and
gas
on
submerged
lands
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
which
are
not
covered
by,
in
effect,
outstanding
leases.
"
when
we
turn
the
page
and
look
at
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph
we
see
the
following
language:
"the
bidding
shall
be
by
sealed
bid
and,
at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary,
on
the
basis
of.
"
there
follow
seven
lettered
paragraphs
describing
variant
bidding
systems;
in
fact,
those
seven
paragraphs,
as
we
read
them,
include
ten
separate
bidding
systems.
and
that,
ending
with
paragraph
(g)
on
the
following
page,
is
followed
by
the
word
"or".
and
then
we
have
subparagraph
(h)
which
is
a
provision,
a
catch-all
provision
allowing
the
two
secretaries
to
devise
permutations,
combinations
or
new
systems.
now,
if
the
matter
ended
there
it
would
be
indeed
very
strained
to
argue
that
"authorized"
meant
directed,
that
"at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary.
"
meant
that
he
had
no
choice
which
system
to
use,
and
that
the
connective
"or"
should
be
read
as
"and".
unfortunately,
we
know
that
resourceful
lawyers
and
resourceful
courts
sometimes
read
language
not
quite
so
literally
as
i've
suggested,
and
it
is
conceivable
that
if
the
statute
ended
there
a
court
might
reasonably
take
the
view
that
if
the
secretaries
declined
to
experiment
with
any
of
the
new
systems
included
in
these
amendments,
that
would
amount
to
an
abuse
of
discretion.
even
then
we
would
argue
that
congress
had
merely
widened
the
choice
available
to
the
secretaries,
had
removed
the
shackles
of
the
original
statute,
had
nudged
goaded
the
secretaries
to
experiment,
but
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
would
remain
free,
if
they
concluded
after
investigation
that
the
public
interest
would
not
be
served,
not
to
use
such
systems.
congress
might
have
been
disappointed,
but
it
would
have
been
free,
as
it
is
now,
to
issue
a
clearer
mandate
to
the
administrators.
but
in
fact,
the
amendments
themselves
resolved
this
matter.
when
we
look
at
the
critical
section
on
page
104a,
which
is
section
(5)(b),
we
see
that
the
statute
has
put
a
limit
on
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
the
two
secretaries
enjoy.
it
has
told
them
that
for
the
next
five
years
at
least
20
percent
but
not
more
than
60
percent
of
the
acreage
offered
must
be
offered
under
bidding
systems
other
than
the
traditional
one,
the
traditional
one
being
(a)
in
this
list.
even
then
there's
an
escape
hatch
which
allows
the
secretary
to
conclude
that
following
that
requirement
is
not
furthering
the
statutory
policies
and
objectives,
but
that
is
no
doubt
a
matter
which
requires
a
heavy
justification.
in
any
event,
it's
a
provision
which
the
secretary
has
not
invoked.
so
in
principle
the
limits
on
the
discretion
of
the
administrators
of
the
program
has
been
defined.
it
has
been
defined
as
follows.
for
at
least
40
percent
and
up
to
80
percent
of
the
acreage
offered
each
year
the
traditional
bidding
system
must
be
used.
and
on
the
other
hand,
for
at
least
20
percent
and
up
to
60
percent
of
the
acreage
the
alternative
systems
must
be
invoked.
now,
the
natural
inference
from
this
specific
provision
qualifying
the
secretary's
discretion
is
that
in
all
other
respects
they
are
free
to
do
as
they
think
best.
now,
it
seems
to
be
argued,
notwithstanding
this,
that
the
provision
which
i
have
just
adverted
to,
(5)(b),
because
it
says
"the
bidding
systems
authorized
shall
be
used
in
the
following
percentages.
"
that
this
means
each
and
every
one
of
them.
now,
respondents
don't
seem
to
have
the
courage
of
their
convictions,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeal.
they
seem
to
be
ready
to
excuse
the
secretaries
from
using
some
of
the
bidding
systems
that
have
been
newly
authorized.
that's
no
doubt
because
it
would
be
extreme
indeed
to
say
that
each
year
the
secretary
must
resort
to
ten
different
systems,
each
with
many
variations
possible,
not
to
mention
devising
new
systems
under
paragraph
(h).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
certainly
have
an
obligation
to
consider
whether
resorting
to
systems
not
yet
used
would
have
such
an
effect;
but
if
they
should
conclude
that
that
statutory
objective
of
furthering
competition--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--but,
justice
brennan,
they
have
considered.
they
have
considered
fully,
and
they
have
stated
their
reasons
to
the
congress
for
concluding
that
two
of
these
systems
would
not
produce
the
desired
effect
and
would
carry
substantial
disadvantages.
it
is
not
a
back
of
the
hand
approach
to
we
will
not
look
at
these
new
systems.
indeed,
the
secretary
of
energy
under
compulsion
of
court
order
has
issued
regulations
for
these
two
systems
mostly
in
dispute,
but
he
has
done
so
with
reservations,
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
concluded
after
study
and
after
consulting
with
his
best
experts,
and
after
experimenting
with
those
ingredients
in
other
ways
that
they
will
not
produce
the
desired
results.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
but
the
secretary
of
energy
in
promulgating
the
regulations
has
also
indicated
his
grave
misgivings
about
the
beneficial
consequences
of
resorting
to
net
profit
share.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
fair
statement
is
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
concluded
that
very
little
can
be
done
by
way
of
changing
bidding
systems
that
will
have
much
of
an
effect
on
the
concentration.
concentration
may
be
slightly
overstated
because
there
is
the
possibility
and
there
is
a
reality
of
joint
ventures
where
smaller
firms
can
join
together;
the
larger
ones
may
not.
but
what
deters
the
smaller
firms
is
the
enormous
costs
quite
outside
of
any
bonus,
and
the
enormous
risks,
especially
now
that
we
are
dealing
with
frontier
areas.
and
in
those
circumstances
smaller
companies
are
simply...
are
unlikely
to
be
in
a
position
to
actively
participate
in
this
offshore
leasing.
the
secretary
has
taken
the
view
that
by
enlarging
the
areas
available
he
may
make
it
more
possible
for
other
firms
not
presently
engaged
to
have
their
opportunity
to
participate.
but
this
question
of
whether
the
secretaries
must
test
each
alternative
is
in
fact
resolved
by
the
statute
itself.
when
we
look
at
section
8(a)(9),
which
is
on
the
same
page,
we
notice
a
reporting
requirement
which
requires
the
secretary
of
energy
in
consultation
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
report
annually
to
congress,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
"the
reason
why
a
particular
bidding
system
has
not
been
or
will
not
be
utilized.
"
suggesting
obviously
that
that
may
be
the
case
and
that
the
secretaries
are
entitled
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
congress
may
look
again
at
their
reasons
and
determine
that
they're
not
satisfactory
and
amend
the
statute
further.
there
is
a
similar
provision
which
appears
on
the
last
page
of
the
brief,
another
report
which
again
requires
the
secretary
of
the
interior
this
time
to
explain
the
reasons
why
a
particular
bidding
system
has
not
been
utilized.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
say
so,
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
our
view
the
text
is
perfectly
clear.
it
resolves
any
ambiguity
there
may
be
in
the
legislative
history.
what
it
seems
to
come
to
is
this:
that
some
members
of
the
congress
were
probably
persuaded
or
at
least
half
persuaded,
perhaps
by
the
respondents
who
were
very
active
in
the
legislative
process,
that
net
profit
share
was
a
promising
alternative.
others
may
have
been
persuaded
that
work
commitment
was
a
promising
alternative.
others
preferred
a
different
formula.
some
members
may
have
been
in
favor
of
compelling
the
secretary
to
adopt
their
pet
system,
though
surprisingly
there
is
no
one
who
unambiguously
says
so
during
the
legislative
debates.
many
were
in
favor
of
widening
the
options
but
leaving
the
secretaries
free
to
make
their
own
decision.
not
unusually,
these
extreme
views
were
either
compromised
or
merged
in
a
wider
consensus,
a
middle
position
which
is
reflected
in
the
enacted
statute;
that
is,
that
some
experimentation
was
indeed
mandated,
short
of
a
very
strong
finding
by
the
secretaries
that
that
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
but
which
new
alternatives
should
be
tested
for
those
experiments
was
a
matter
left
to
the
administrators
of
the
program.
now,
that's
hardly
a
surprising
conclusion.
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
bidding
system
are
not
easily
appraised
by
laymen
or
by
lawyers
or
by
judges.
when
one
reads
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
it
seems
more
addressed
to
a
specialized
tribunal
of
experts
than
it
does
an
ordinary
court
of
law.
economists
on
both
sides
have
exhausted
themselves
in
arguing
the
merits
and
demerits
of
each
system.
congress
itself
was
reluctant
to
resolve
that
technical
debate.
much
less,
as
it
seems
to
us,
did
congress
invite
the
courts
to
resolve
it.
congress
has
monitored
this
program.
there
have
been
at
least
three
legislative
oversight
hearings
since
the
program
began.
the
secretary
has
fully
advised
the
congress
of
his
actions.
the
congress
so
far
has
been
content
to
leave
well
enough
alone.
in
our
view
the
court
of
appeal
ought
not
have
interfered.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
the
end
of
each
fiscal
year.
several
reports.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
they're
addressed
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
of
the
senate,
but
they
no
doubt
are
referred
to
committees.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
concerning
the
relative
importance
of
the
bonus
as
compared
to
the
development
cost,
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
one
of
the
responses
filed,
lodged
with
the
court.
it's
a
document
which
represents
the
responses
of
secretary
watt
to
questions
asked
at
the
most
recent
oversight
hearings
in
june.
that
response
is
dated
september
14
of
this
year.
and
particularly
on
page
38
and
on
page
39
of
that
document
there
are
two
answers
to
questions
by
congressman
lowry
specifically
addressed
to
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
cash
bonus
as
compared
to
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
development
cost.
the
secretary
there
recites
that
the
development
cost
can
exceed
one
billion
dollars;
no
bonus
has
ever
reached
anywhere
near
that
amount.
turning
to
the
question
that
was
focused
on
by
justice
white,
if
our
opponents
concede
that
the
statute
does
not
require
testing
each
and
every
one
of
the
various
alternatives...
and
there
are
at
least
ten
of
them...
then
there
is
no
basis
in
the
statute
to
prefer
one
over
another.
congress
treated
these
alternative
bonus
systems
as
true
alternatives,
and
it's
no
good
saying
that
congress
really
meant
that
net
profit
was
the
only
true
alternative.
congress
simply
did
not
view
it
that
way.
one
last
thought.
the
talk
of
experimenting
is
a
little
lighthearted
when
one
appreciates
that
it
isn't
an
experiment
which
is
subject
to
repeal.
once
lease
is
granted,
if
it
turns
into
an
unprofitable
operation
either
in
terms
of
the
revenues
engendered
or
perhaps
more
important
in
terms
of
the
oil
extracted...
and
that
is
one
of
the
prime
legislative
objectives...
there
is
no
repeal.
the
secretary
has
made
a
very
serious
mistake
which
he
cannot
undo.
it
would
be
irresponsible.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
has,
if
i
may
read
his
most
recent
answer
to
secretary
lowry,
the
congressman
refers
to
an
affidavit
which
is
filed
here
in
which
the
secretary
indicates
that
he
has
no
intention
for
the
present
of
using
the
net
profit
system.
and
the
secretary
responds
as
follows:
"we
do
not
believe
that
the--
"
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--this
is
lodged,
the
complete
document
is
lodged.
my
learned
friend
lodged
a
portion
of
it.
in
turn
i
thought
the
court
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
entire
document,
and
these
are
now
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
the
court.
it's
a
document
only
dated
september
14th
and
therefore
couldn't
be
in
the
record.
the
secretary
first
makes
a
legal
argument
to
the
effect
that
he's
not
compelled
to
do
so,
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"we
do
not
believe
the
variable
net
profit
share
bidding
or
work
commitment
bidding
warrant
testing
because
of
the
strong
likelihood
that
such
systems
would
severely
damage
our
efforts
to
promote
exploration
and
development
of
the
cuter
continental
shelf
oil
and
gas
that
is
both
expeditious
and
efficient.
"
"a
substantial
body
of
analysis.
"
if
i
may
interpolate,
indicating
that
he
has
considered
and
researched
the
matter...
"a
substantial
body
of
analysis
of
bidding
system
performance
has
been
developed
over
the
past
five
years.
"
"it
can
now
be
used
to
identify
the
effects
of
such
systems
as
profit
share
bidding.
"
"unfortunately,
the
effects
of
profit
share
bidding
that
we
have
identified
include
dampening
of
exploration
and
inefficient
development
and
production.
"
"the
effect
of
work
commitment
in
this
analysis
is
substantial
overinvestment
in
exploration.
"
"in
addition,
tests
of
other
systems--
"
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--there
are
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
secretary
of
energy
has
filed
his
annual
reports,
and
indeed
in
his
recently
promulgated
regulations,
the
preambles
to
which
are
reproduced
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
he,
the
secretary
of
energy,
indicates
his
reservations
about
these
systems.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
i
regret
to
say
is
somewhat
delinquent
in
filing
his
report.
that
report
has
been
prepared.
it
is
now
under
review
and
will
shortly
be
filed
with
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
was.
no.
well,
i
think
it's
substantially
overdue.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
six
months
after
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
i
think
therefore
this
one
is
six
months
out
of
date.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice.
i
suggest
that
you
do,
as
i've
indicated,
concentrate
on
not
the
excerpts
which
my
friend
opposite
has
submitted,
but
on
those
portions
of
that
same
document
to
which
i've
referred
the
court,
specifically
pages
38
and
39,
which
do
contain
the
secretary's
most
current
evaluation
of
the
reason
why
in
his
view
it
would
be
irresponsible
to--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
we're
only
trying
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
congress
is
fully
abreast
of
the
secretary's
action,
and
in
our
submission
it
is
for
the
congress
if
it
thinks
there
has
been
a
default
to
take
corrective
action.
it
is
wholly
inappropriate
in
our
view
to
ask
a
court
to
arbitrate
this
very
technical
debate
between
experts,
i
submit.
