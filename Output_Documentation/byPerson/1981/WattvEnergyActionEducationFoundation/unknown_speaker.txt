unknown
speaker
what
were
the
statutory
objections?
unknown
speaker
was
there
also
an
objective
to
increase
the
number
of
bids
per
lease?
unknown
speaker
there
was?
unknown
speaker
and
also
to
decrease
the
concentration
of
the
leasing?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
government
have
any
doubt
that
the
court
of
appeals,
to
get
by
the
standing
question
the
court
of
appeals
properly
reached
the
matter.
wasn't
the
only
issue
there
the
propriety
of
issuing
that
preliminary
injunction
or
not
issuing
it?
unknown
speaker
the
other
issues
remain
whether
the
district
court
should
have
issued
a
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
which
still
has
an
appeal.
unknown
speaker
there
being
how
many
altogether?
unknown
speaker
in
addition
to
the
two
originally?
unknown
speaker
ten
altogether.
nine
new
ones
and
plus
a
catch-all
provision
which
authorizes
the
secretaries
to
devise
further
permutations,
combinations
and
indeed
brand-new
systems.
the
court
also
directed
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
experiment
with
at
least
these
two
systems.
the
entire
purpose
of
requiring
the
secretary
of
energy
to
promulgate
the
regulations
was
that
under
the
statute
that
is
a
necessary
first
step.
the
basic
holding
is
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
must
actually
experiment
with
these
two
systems
which
do
not
involve
a
bidding
on
the
front-end
bonus.
now,
i
will
turn
directly
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
if
i
may,
and
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
statutory
provisions.
the
relevant
provisions
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
beginning
at
page
101a.
if
one
looks--
--are
you
still
persisting
in
your
view
of
standing?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
going
to
argue
that
one.
unknown
speaker
your
position
on
standing
is
that
the
plaintiffs'
interest
is
sufficiently
tenuous
that
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
arlington
heights
or
warth
v.
seldin.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
claiborne,
that
we
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
standing
of
the
state
and
the
city.
we
don't
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
standing
of
consumer
groups.
unknown
speaker
do
you
still
say,
mr.
claiborne,
that
even
if
the
systems
now
being
employed
didn't
appreciably
increase
the
number
of
bids
per
lease
and
decrease
the
concentration
of
the
leasing
market
that
nevertheless
the
secretaries
would
have
no
obligation
under
the
1978
provision
to
employ
other
systems?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
then
that
at
least
if
that
condition
obtained
they
would
have
to
consider
whether
or
not
other
alternatives
should
be
used?
unknown
speaker
which
of
the
secretaries
has
concluded
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
either
concluded
that
the
alternatives
now
being
used
sufficiently
deconcentrate
the
leasing
market
without
resort
to
others?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
your
reliance
on
9(d)
suggests
that
if
we
accept
it,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
how
often
are
the
reports
required?
at
the
end
of
each
fiscal
year,
mr.
claiborne?
unknown
speaker
and
do
they
go
directly
to
committees
or
do
they
go
generally
to
the
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
silard,
what
do
you
do
with
9(d)?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
doesn't
this
have
some
interconnection
with
5(b)?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
say,
though,
"if
applicable,
the
reason
why
a
particular
bidding
system
has
not
been
or
will
not
be
utilized.
"
there's
no
suggestion
that
there's
any
exception
for
those
within
the
five
years.
unknown
speaker
what
page
did
you
say,
mr.
silard?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
silard,
that's
just
as
clear
as
the
statute
in
the
sense
that
the
words
"the
bidding
systems"
as
you
read
them
mean
all
of
the
bidding
systems
or
each
of
the
bidding
systems.
unknown
speaker
you
do
in
effect
say
"the
bidding
systems"
means
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
but
just
those
that
you've
read
so
far
in
the
statutory
language
doesn't
distinguish
between
bonus
and
nonbonus.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
view?
is
it
all
or
less
than
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
read
the
statute
as
requiring
that
all
of
them
be
used?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
interested
in
your
position.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
then
you
have
to
agree
on
what
bonus
bidding
means
in
that
particular
sentence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
silard,
i
want
to
be
sure
about
your
position.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
rest
your
entire
case
on
the
selection
on
page
19
of
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading,
mr.
silard?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
language
you
just
relied
upon
is
followed
by
language,
"has
been
amended
to
allow",
"to
allow
the
secretary".
does
that
mean
to
compel
the
secretary?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
legislative
history,
not
statutory
language,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
plan
to
rest
your
standing
contentions
as
to
warth
and
simon
v.
eastern
kentucky
on
your
brief,
as
did
the
government?
unknown
speaker
mr.
silards,
may
i
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--it
isn't
clear,
is
it,
whether
even
if
california
were
to
win
here
that
the
secretary
would
be
likely
to
use
the
bidding
systems
that
california
prefers
on
the
pools
that
california
shares
with
the
federal
government?
in
other
words,
since
the
secretary
would
still
be
free
to
have
other
experiments,
how
is
it
clear
that
california
in
that
way
would
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
silard,
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
when
was
the
last
time
california
engaged
in
co-leasing?
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
mr.
claiborne
to
say
that
california
had
not
participated
since
1968?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
participated
in
revenues
as
a
co-leaser
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
just
to--
unknown
speaker
--in
these
situations
where
a
joint
pool,
california
and
the
federal
pool,
is
leased,
does
california
participate
in
the
division
of
the
front-end
bonus?
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
the
bonus
is
paid,
say
the
drilling
is
unsuccessful
and
they
don't
produce
anything,
does
california
still
get
a
share
of
this?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
so
clear,
why
do
you
suppose
no
disappointed
bidders
have
joined
your
litigation?
unknown
speaker
it
is
surprising
that
there
are
no
oil
companies
that
share
your
view.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
mean
as
far
as
the
record
discloses.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
the
relative
front-end
cost
of,
a)
the
bonus...
i
don't
know
how
big
these
bonuses...
say
you
had
a
million
dollar
bonus.
what
would
the
front-end
cost
in
exploration
and
drilling
be
to
find
out
whether
there
is
oil
really
there?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
the
relative
significance
of
the
two
factors?
unknown
speaker
mr
silard,
i
don't
think
you
really
get
the
thrust
of
my
question.
my
question
goes
to
the
relative
importance
of
the
cash
bonus
as
opposed
to
other
costs
of
drilling
a
well.
for
example,
if
it
costs
a
million
dollars
to
get
the
lease
and
a
hundred
billion
dollars
to
drill
the
well,
the
million
dollar
front-end
money
really
wouldn't
be
that
significant.
unknown
speaker
but
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
is
really
what
i'm
asking.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
silard,
doesn't
that
go
back
to
the
standing
question,
that
there
are
so
many
independent
acts
following
between
the
bidding
and
the
production
that
you,
like
in
simon,
you
simply
can't
trace
accurately
one
to
the
other?
unknown
speaker
mr.
silard,
i
take
it
that
absent
the
legislative
history
to
which
you
have
referred
that
you
would
agree
that
the
statute
on
its
face
doesn't
require
the
secretary
to
use
each
one
of
those
alternatives.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
position
is
that
the
statute
on
its
face
requires.
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
legislative
history
doesn't
relieve
the
secretary
from
any
duty
to
use
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
now,
just
stick
to
my
question.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
your
front-end
argument
is--
unknown
speaker
--the
statute
on
its
face
means
use
every
one
of
them;
the
legislative
history
means
use
every
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
i'm
not
sure
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
suppose
the
statute
doesn't
mean
on
its
face
that
the
secretary
has
to
use
each
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
or
applied
just
as
though
it
said
on
its
face
"but
remember,
mr.
secretary,
you
must
use
some
of
the
non-cash
bonus
systems.
"
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that
congress
is
unaware
of
all
these
problems?
unknown
speaker
what
reason
has
the
secretary
given
congress
for
not
using
non-cash
bonus
systems?
unknown
speaker
is
this
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
claiborne,
there
are
formal
reports
required
by
the
secretary
to
congress
on
the
effects
of
the
experiments?
unknown
speaker
has
he
explained
in
those
reports
why
he
has
not
used
profit
sharing?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
that
due
the
first
of
october,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
reports
each
fiscal
year.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
suggest
we
do
what
you
have
done
and
ignore
this
last
entry
we've
had,
this
late
entry
which
appears
to
be
letters
from
mr.
watt,
that
mr.
silard
just
gave
us
a
minute
ago?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
we
start
with
a
complaint
of
60
some
pages
and
we
keep
getting
stuff
entered
into
the
record
until
this
morning,
we've
got
a
real
problem,
haven't
we?
