this
case
concerns
the
bidding
systems
the
secretary
of
the
interior
must
use
in
the
leasing
by
auction
of
oil
and
gas
tracts
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
prior
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
amendments
of
1978,
the
secretary
almost
always
auctioned
leases
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
on
the
basis
of
a
fixed
royalty
with
the
bidding
on
the
amount
of
an
initial
cash
bonus
to
be
paid
when
the
lease
was
awarded.
this
system
required
large
front-end
payments
by
the
successful
bidder.
as
a
result
that
ran
into
criticism
in
congress
because
it
required
such
large
amounts
of
capital
that
small
and
medium
size
oil
companies
often
could
not
afford
to
participate.
in
response,
congress
passed
the
1978
amendments
which
authorized
the
secretary
to
experiment
with
the
use
of
a
variety
of
new
bidding
systems.
the
present
suit
was
brought
under
the
1978
amendments
by
the
state
of
california
in
the
city
of
long
beach
joined
by
various
consumer
organizations
and
private
individuals.
they
challenged
the
secretary’s
failure
to
experiment
with
certain
of
these
new
bidding
systems.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
agreed
with
california
and
the
other
plaintiffs
that
the
1978
amendments
require
the
secretary
to
experiment
with
these
bidding
systems,
but
we
reversed.
we
read
the
amendments
to
leave
the
selection
of
bidding
systems
to
the
secretary’s
discretion
subject
of
course
to
congressional
oversight.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
