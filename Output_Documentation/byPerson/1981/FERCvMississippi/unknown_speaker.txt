unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
lee,
you
did
say
that
whatever
federal
regulations
are
needed
have
now
been
promulgated?
unknown
speaker
how
long
have
they
been
effective?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
do
you
think
congress
could
direct,
for
instance,
a
state
legislature
to
consider
certain
statutes?
mandate
that
under
the
tenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
so
in
the
commerce
area
you
would
argue
that
congress
could
go
so
far
as
to
even
mandate
state
legislatures
to
consider
certain
laws.
unknown
speaker
but
these
public
utility
commissions
of
states
are
an
administrative
arm
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government,
and
they
are
being
told
that
they
must
consider
certain
action.
they
are
not
being
told
they
have
to
implement
it,
but
they
must
consider
it,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
general
lee,
what
is
the
mechanism
by
which
the
ferc
is
entitled
to
enforce
this
duty
to
consider?
unknown
speaker
what
court
does
it
proceed
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
law
says
that
the
body
must
consider
it.
how
does
it...
if
the
agency
just...
nothing
ever
comes
before
the
agency,
they
don't
put
it
on
the
docket,
no
one...
does
somebody
suggest
to
them
that
they
are
under
a
legal
obligation?
unknown
speaker
could
appear
before
them
and
say
i
move
you
or
perhaps
you
should...
and
then
they
reject
him
and
then--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
he
can
take
them
to
state
court
to
review
an
administrative
agency--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
if
it
is
taken
to
state
court.
well,
how
does
it
ever
get
there?
the
agency
says
we
don't
want
to
go
to
court.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
decides
it
isn't
going
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
authority
or
even
if
there
isn't,
could
the
secretary
bring
a
suit
and
get
an
injunction
ordering
them
to
consider
it,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
provision
for
it,
anyway,
in
the
act.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor,
is
there
anymore
effectiveness
to
this
than
there
is
to
the
constitution's
provision
that
the
state
officers
must
take
an
oath
and
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
is
it
anymore
effective
than
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
in
the
surface
mining
case,
couldn't
the
states
continue
regulating
in
that
field
as
long
as
they
didn't
conflict
with
federal
law?
i
mean,
there
is
a
section
preserving
state
law
and
procedure
if
it
doesn't
conflict.
and
in
this
case,
the
state
can't
choose
not
to
participate
unless
it
just
wants
to
get
out
public
utility
regulation
totally.
so
the
choice
for
the
states
is
much
harder
here,
is
it
not,
than
it
was
in
the
surface
mining
case?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
curious,
mr.
solicitor,
do
we
know
what
the
recorded
vote
of
the
mississippi
senators
and
the
house
delegation
were
on
this
compromise?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
they
just
talked
congress
into
passing
a
law
that
gave
them
an
unconstitutional
order.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
federal
authority
could
have
done
all
the
things
that
they
hoped
the
states
would
do?
unknown
speaker
what
specifically
do
you
object
to?
the
fact
that...
the
act
saying
that
they
must
consider
certain
things,
put
certain
things
on
their
agenda?
unknown
speaker
does
the
act
mention
that
in
a--
unknown
speaker
--what
does
that
mean,
can
enforce
the
provisions?
unknown
speaker
well,
any
person
couldn't
do
that
without
a
case
or
a
controversy.
i
mean,
just
some
wiseacre
off
the
street
couldn't
go
in
and
enforce
it.
so
who--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
appropriate
state
court.
unknown
speaker
so
he
could
bring
an
action
in
his
own
name
against
the
regulatory
commission
seeking
an
order
or
an
injunction
or
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
make
them
carry
out
their
obligations
under
the
act.
that's
the
way
you
read
the
act.
unknown
speaker
has
any
such
action
ever
been
brought,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
if
the
act
had
said
we
request,
rather
than
order,
and
some
state
utility
commission
had
complied
with
the
request
but
rejected
all...
and
went
through
the
motions
but
then...
would
you
object
to
the
secretary
having
the
right
to
appeal
and
challenge
the
agency
decision?
unknown
speaker
under
the
tenth
amendment?
i
know
you
object
to
it,
but
would--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
meant
he
can
appear
before
the
agency,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
the
agency
has
voluntarily
gone
through
these
motions.
they
have
been
requested
to
but
not
ordered
to,
and
they
go
through
the
motions.
they
consider
all
these
things.
they
reject
them
all.
and
the
secretary
says,
well,
you
certainly
made
a
mistake;
i'm
going
to
go
to
court,
i'm
going
to
take
you
up.
and
they
say
go
ahead.
would
you
say
that's
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
conceive
the
issue
to
be
on
appeal,
say,
before
one
of
your
state
courts?
or
do
you
ordinarily
hear
an
appeal
from
the
utility
commission?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it
would
just
be
the
ordinary
state
standard,
and
would
vary
from
state
to
state,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
from
that,
the
ultimate
decision
of
your
highest
state
court
would
not
be
reviewable
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
federal
question
would
there
be?
that's
what
i...
for
1257
there
would
have
to
be
a
final
decision
on
the
federal
question,
wouldn't
there?
unknown
speaker
maybe,
but
he
intervenes.
he
intervenes
and
the
court
affirms
the
rejection
of
all
the
federal
standards.
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
you
did
violate
something
by
what
you
did
might
be
a
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
you
were
required
to
follow
them.
just
consider
them.
take,
for
example,
the--
--but
you
have
a
routine
of
how
you
consider
them.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you're
talking
about
about
the
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
say
you
considered
it
and
you
said
we
don't
like
it,
it
doesn't
work
well
in
mississippi.
wouldn't
that
discharge
your
federal
obligation?
under
title
i,
that
is.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask.
could
a
consumer
in
mississippi
raise
the
same
question
in
some
of
your
agency
procedures?
could
a
consumer
come
in
and
file
a
petition
and
say
i'd
like
to
ask
the
commission
to
adopt
a
rule
against
declining
block
rates,
or
whatever
they
are,
time-a-day
rates--
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
been
constitutional
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
the
secretary
of
energy
can
direct
25
federal
employees
within
the
city
of
jackson
to
file
such
a
petition?
who
are
all
consumers.
unknown
speaker
under
the
procedures,
you'd
be
required
to
consider
the
standard.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you
really
mean
your
statement.
there
are
a
lot
of
federal
laws
that
forbid
a
state
agency
from
doing
certain
things.
unknown
speaker
federal
laws
that
forbid
state
agencies
from
doing
certain
things.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
that
makes
a
conflict.
if
the
prohibition
is
constitutional,
that
is
a
conflict
if
the
state
agency
purports
to
do
something
that
it's
forbidden
to
do.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
this
is
different.
unknown
speaker
have
you
been
able
to
find
any
other
statute
like
this?
has
there
ever
been
one,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
state
still
had
an
option.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alston,
would
you
agree
that
at
least
some
portion
of
section
210
simply
preempt,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
some
applicable
rules
and
don't
pose
a
tenth
amendment
problem?
would
you
agree
with
that?
that
certainly
some
sections
of
section
210
don't
have
that
kind
of
a--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
that
section
210
would
significantly
hinder
states
in
their
ability
to
perform
other
functions?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
congress
could
say
not
only
consider
these,
but
what
if
congress
just
said
we
find
that
it
is
essential
to
regulation
of
commerce
that
in
ratemaking,
state
public
utilities
commissions
shall
follow
the
following
standard.
and
it
just
says
what
the
standard
is.
they
don't
say
consider
it,
they
prescribe
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
a...
there
are
a
lot
of
federal
laws
that
affect
the
rates
that
a
public
utility
commission
can
allow.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
federal
law
could
limit
the
ratemaking
activities
of
the...
say
in
the
railroad
business?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
saying
now
there
is
such
a
finding.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
preempt
it;
they
just
said,
here
is
the
standard
you
will
use.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does,
in
a
sense,
preempt.
it
says,
here
is
the
standard
you
will
use.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
this
slightly
different
question
on
what
justice
white
asked.
supposing
congress
passed
a
law
saying
that
declining
block
rates
shall
be
prohibited
throughout
the
united
states
because
we
make
findings
that
they
use
up
too
much
energy?
could
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
an
affirmative
prohibition.
could
they
say,
then,
we
will
require
time-of-day
rates
in
all
parts
of
the
country
because
they
are
in
the
interest
of
conservation?
every
state
must
have
time-of-day
rates.
and
then
if
you
say
yes,
to
that,
could
they
then
say
they
must
put
them
in
effect
unless
they
first
consider
them
and
decide
not
to
put
them
in
effect?
would
that
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
then
that
crosses
the
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens
on
there
will
be
time-of-day
rates
everywhere?
unknown
speaker
and
all
the
findings
that
you
could
possibly
think
of
are
made
in
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
that's
it.
and
the
necessity
for
it
is
spelled
out
in
the
findings.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
the...
let's
say
that
that
kind
of
a
requirement
would
be
constitutional.
and
suppose
a
utility
commission
refused
to
put
in
time-of-day
rates.
you
apparently,
if
you
say
that
rule
was
constitutional
there
must
be
some
enforcement
mechanism.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
solicitor
general's
testa
v.
katt
reliance?
there,
certainly,
the
federal
government
prescribed
a
rule
of
decision
and
said
a
state
court
had
to
follow
it.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
think
testa
v.
katt
applies
at
all
in
this
case.
as
i
read
the
case,
i
see
it
is
that
a
state
court
simply
cannot
discriminate
in
a
federal
cause
of
action
if
they
hear
state
causes
of
action
under
the
same
cause.
of
course,
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
goes
much
further.
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
today,
it
first
is
an
administrative
agency,
it
is
not
a
court,
to
start
off
with.
this
is
a
legislative
functioning,
it's
ratemaking,
it's
legislative
in
mississippi,
and
these
are
affirmative
burdens
placed
on
the
mississippi
public
service
commission.
that's
a
far
cry
from
what
testa
v.
katt
is
being
cited
for.
secondly,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
certainly,
the
public
service
commission
wouldn't
even
have
jurisdiction
over
the
question
of
wholesale
rates
in
that
connection,
and
certainly
testa
v.
katt
would
never
say
that
you
can
force
jurisdiction
on
a
court
such
as
this.
there's
no
doubt
that
a
statute
such
as
we
are
talking
about
is
attractive
to
congress.
i
can
see
where
they
can
say
that
they
do
not
want
to
take
care
of
the
burden
of
enforcing
it,
and
put
it
on
the
states
to
enforce.
this
is
where
we
say
that
you
run
into
the
questions
of
federalism,
and
this
is
where
we
say
that
we
run
into
trouble.
mr.
alston,
the
statute
may
also
be
more
attractive
to
many
states
than
the
alternative
of
total
federal
regulation,
wouldn't
you
say?
unknown
speaker
federal
preemption
would
be
preferable,
then.
unknown
speaker
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
that
middle
ground
of
preemption,
and
instead
of
taking
over
the
whole
regulatory
job
you
just
mandate
a
series
of
standards
that
must
be
followed.
there
shall
be
time-of-day
rates
everywhere,
or,
they
go
right
through
the
list.
they
say
this
is
what
the
rule
of
the
game
is.
that
doesn't...
and
if
that's
constitutional,
that
doesn't
mean
the
federal
government
is
taking
over
the
regulation.
unknown
speaker
they
tell
them
the
rules
of
the
game,
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
is
a
highway
patrolman
in
mississippi
bound
to
enforce
the
55
mile
speed
limit,
or
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
except
for
that,
he
isn't.
is
that
it?
except
for
the
fact
that
they
are
in
part
supported
by
the
federal
government?
what
about...
is
a
state
officer
required
to
enforce--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
it
isn't
tied
with
a
grant
for
federal
highways?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
55
mile
an
hour
speed
limit
is
one
promulgated
by
mississippi
because
it
feels
that
otherwise
it
would
lose
its
federal
highway
entitlement--
unknown
speaker
--let's
assume...
i
took
justice
white's
question
to
be...
that
if
there
were
no
grants
involved
and
this
wasn't
a
quid
pro
quo,
a
condition
of
the
grant,
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
for
55
mile
speed
limit
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
gasoline
and
energy
in
the
national
interest,
in
your
view,
must
mississippi
enforce
that
or
does
it
have
a
choice?
unknown
speaker
even
if
they're
related
to
commerce
and
the
national
security?
even
if
they
have
made
that
claim?
unknown
speaker
would
be
enforced?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alston,
let's
back
up
a
minute.
doesn't
your
public
service
commission
feel
itself
bound
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
so
that's...
so
it's
not
absolutely
free.
unknown
speaker
i
hear
you
talking
about
mandamus.
do
you
have
mandamus
in
your
state
laws?
unknown
speaker
right
now.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
not
anything
new,
either,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
and
it
would
apply
against
the
public
service
commission
under
the
right
state
of
facts.
unknown
speaker
and
without
this
provision
you
read
from
the
report.
unknown
speaker
in
that
respect,
you
analogize
it,
i
suppose,
to
the
55
mile
an
hour
hypothetical
that
we
proposed.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
purely
under
the
spending
clause,
or
under
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
are
you
disturbed
at
all
by
the
breadth
of
the
standing
clauses
in
this
statute?
clauses
that
provide
standing
for,
in
one
section,
any
consumer
of
electricity,
which
means
every
citizen,
really;
and
in
another
section,
standing
for
any
person
providing
attorney's
fees
and
other
reasonable
expenses?
a
field
day
for
lawyers,
at
least.
are
there
other
federal
statutes
that
have
gone
that
far
in
changing
the
state
rules
of
standing
before
regulatory
commissions,
or
courts?
