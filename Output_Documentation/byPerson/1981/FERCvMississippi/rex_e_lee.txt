mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
public
utility
regulatory
policies
act,
one
of
five
statutes
enacted
in
1978
as
part
of
a
comprehensive
effort
to
deal
with
this
nation's
energy
problems.
it
would
be
helpful
to
consider
the
statute
in
two
basic
parts.
the
first
part
consists
of
titles
i
and
iii,
which
share
three
common
statutorily-identified
goals.
the
first
is
to
promote
the
conservation
of
energy
supplied
by
utilities;
second
is
to
optimize
the
efficient
use
of
facilities
and
resources
by
utilities;
and
the
third
is
to
ensure
equitable
rights
to
consumers.
title
i
deals
with
electricity,
and
title
iii
with
gas.
title
i
requires
state
regulatory
authorities
and
non-regulated
electric
utilities
to
consider
the
adoption
of
one
set
of
standards,
six
in
number,
dealing
with
electric
rates,
and
a
second
set
of
standards,
five
in
number,
dealing
with
terms
and
conditions
of
electric
service.
the
rate
standards,
all
of
them,
and
some
of
the
electric
service
standards
are
directed
toward
two
objectives.
the
first
is
to
cut
down
the
amount
of
electric
energy,
and
therefore
imported
oil,
that
is
consumed
in
this
country.
and
the
second
objective
is
to
shift
electric
demand
away
from
peak
periods,
thereby
diminishing
the
use
of
less
efficient
generating
facilities
and
scarce
fuels;
notably,
oil.
as
to
gas,
title
iii
requires
consideration
of
only
two
of
the
terms
service
standards.
each
of
the
standards,
both
title
i
and
title
iii,
is
to
be
considered
in
a
hearing
after
public
notice,
and
a
written
statement
of
the
reasons
for
declining
to
implement
or
adopt...
in
the
event
of
a
declamation
to
implement
or
adopt...
any
of
the
standards
is
to
be
made
available
to
the
public.
in
addition,
titles
i
and
iii
require
that
within
one
year
after
enactment
of
the
statute
and
annually
thereafter
for
ten
years,
state
regulatory
authorities
and
non-regulated
utilities
report
the
progress
of
their
consideration
of
these
standards
to
the
secretary
of
energy
who
in
turn
is
to
submit
a
summary
and
analysis
of
the
reports
to
congress.
the
other
part
of
the
statute
is
title
ii,
probably
the
most
controversial.
specifically,
section
210,
whose
objective
is
to
encourage
the
development
of
cogeneration
and
small
power
production
facilities.
cogeneration
is
the
combined
product
of
both
electrical
energy
and
useful
thermal
energy
such
as
heat
or
steam
from
a
single
process.
it
has
great
potential
as
a
source
of
energy
conservation.
at
one
time
it
accounted
for
some
15
%
of
this
nation's
energy
total,
but
with
the
advent
of
cheap
fossil
fuel
power,
that
has
diminished
to
4
%.
a
small
power
production
facility
is
a
facility
having
a
capacity
of
no
more
than
80
megawatts
and
using
something
other
fossil
fuels,
defined
by
the
statute
as
biomass,
waste,
geothermal
or
renewable
resources
such
as
wind,
water,
solar
energy,
for
the
purpose
of
producing
electric
power.
congress
identified
two
impediments
to
the
potential
of
cogeneration
and
small
power
production
facilities
as
additional
sources
of
domestic
power
with
consequent
lessening
of
dependence
on
foreign
oil.
the
first
was
its
conclusion
that
subjecting
cogeneration
and
small
power
production
facilities
to
the
usual
state
and
federal
regulatory
burdens
was
unnecessary
and
would
unduly
discourage
their
development.
the
more
controversial
aspect
of
the
congressional
determination
was
the
second.
these
two
types
of
facilities
must
rely
on
traditional
electric
utilities,
both
as
a
source
of
backup
power,
and
also
as
a
market
for
their
surplus
power.
they
do
not
sell
generally
to
the
public.
they
use
them
only
for
their
own
purposes.
evidence
before
congress
showed
that
since
these
facilities
are
potential
competitors
of
public
utilities,
utilities
were
often
less
than
cooperative
in
supplying
either
backup
power
or
markets.
purpa
deals
with
each
of
these
impediments.
its
response
to
the
problem
of
surplus
and
backup
power
is
the
most
hotly-contested
of
the
act's
provisions.
what
congress
eventually
adopted
in
this
respect
represents
a
compromise.
the
administration's
proposal,
which
passed
the
house
and
was
sent
to
the
senate,
would
have
established
a
regulatory
program
virtually
identical
to
that
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
virginia
surface
mining
act
case
last
term,
under
which
the
regulatory
burden
would
have
been
assumed
by
federal
authorities
in
the
event
that
state
authorities
chose
not
to
participate.
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
the
senate
bill
would
have
required
the
secretary
to
follow
basically
the
title
i/title
iii
approach,
which
is
simply
to
recommend
guidelines
to
state
public
service
commissions
that
they
could
adopt
or
not.
opponents
of
the
administration
house
bill,
by
the
time
it
got
to
the
senate,
presented
to
congress
substantial
testimony
and
arguments
to
the
effect
that
it
was
state
rather
than
federal
officials
who
possess
the
necessary
expertise
to
implement
reforms.
the
legislation
dealing
with
these
issues
should
be
responsive
to
local
needs
and
local
differences,
and
that
what
might
be
appropriate
for
florida
might
not
necessarily
be
appropriate
for
oregon.
and
that
the
states
should
be
allowed
to
continue
to
experiment
in
the
national
interest
with
different
regulatory
approaches.
the
compromise
that
became
law
was
responsive
to
these
arguments,
which
were
grounded
in
the
preservation
of
state
interests.
the
act,
in
fact,
gives
the
authority
to
make
general
rules
to
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
in
order
to
achieve
the
general
objectives
of
the
act,
but
with
the
more
specific
authority
to
implement
the
statute
being
left
to
the
states.
the
commission
has,
in
fact,
adopted
regulations
which
afford
the
states
great
latitude
in
determining
how
the
congressional
objectives
are
to
be
achieved.
under
these
regulations,
state
implementation
may
be
accomplished
by
any
one
of
three
ways.
first
of
all,
by
the
issuance
of
regulations.
second,
and
probably
most
important
for
purposes
of
this
lawsuit,
by
the
resolution
of
disputes
between
utilities
and
qualifying
facilities
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
the
third
is
a
general
catch-all;
by
any
other
action
reasonably
designed
to
give
effect
to
the
commission's
rules.
this
suit
was
brought
by
the
state
of
mississippi
and
its
public
service
commission
with
mississippi
power
and
light
being
permitted
to
intervene,
against
the
secretary
of
energy
who
has
general
responsibility
for
titles
i
and
iii,
and
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
which
has
general
responsibility
for
title
ii,
section
210,
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
entire
act
is
beyond
the
scope
of
congress'
commerce
clause
power
and
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
state
sovereignty
as
declared
by
this
court
in
national
league
of
cities
and
towns
v.
usery.
judge
cox's
decision
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
both
grounds
preceded
this
court's
decision
in
hodel
v.
indiana
and
virginia
surface
mining,
and
this
appeal
followed.
there
are
two
independent
reasons
in
the
government's
view
why
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
must
be
reversed.
first,--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
they
are
extremely
deferential
to
the
states.
they
leave
to
the
states
as
much
discretion
as
the
proponents
of
that
approach
before
congress
said
they
should--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--they
were
adopted...
i'll
find
that
out.
the
two
reasons
why
this
decision
must
be
reversed,
in
our
view,
are,
first,
applying
the
standards
announced
by
this
court
in
hodel
and
earlier
in
usery,
there
is
no
constitutional
violation,
looking
at
it
as
an
exercise
of
congress'
commerce
clause
power.
and
second,
the
act
is
also
a
legitimate
exercise
of
congress'
power
to
provide
for
our
national
defense.
i
will
look
at
the
commerce
clause
issues
first.
last
term
in
the
virginia
surface
mining
case,
this
court
identified
three
hurdles
plus
a
balancing
test
that
a
challenge
to
a
congressional
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
on
tenth
amendment
grounds
must
surmount.
before
turning
to
a
specific
discussion
of
those
three
issues,
however,
i
would
like
first
to
point
out
the
aspect
of
this
case
that
distinguishes
it
from
national
league
of
cities
and
towns
v.
usery,
and
simply
makes
the
rationale
of
that
case
inapplicable
to
this
case.
the
evil
against
which
this
court's
holding
in
national
league
of
cities
and
towns
protects
is
intrusion
by
one
sovereign
in
a
federal
system
into
the
prerogatives
of
another.
and
that
problem
simply
does
not
exist
where,
as
here,
the
only
reason
that
the
states
are
exercising
authority
in
the
field
at
all
is
that
congress
chooses
to
permit
them
to
do
so.
this
difference
between
the
act
in
both
of
the
predecessors
to
this
case
and
this
case
is
illustrated
both
by
the
history
and
also
by
the
content
of
this
legislation.
the
appellees
concede,
as
they
must,
that
the
state
functions
of
whose
federal
invasion
they
complain
could
have
been
totally
preempted
by
congress.
the
reason
that
congress
did
not
do
so
is
that
it
was
persuaded
by
the
advocates
of
federalism
that
the
wiser
policy
and
the
more
effective
policy
was
to
preserve
a
larger
role
for
the
states.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
it
was
in
an
area,
that
if
it
was
in
an
area,
that
clearly
could
be
preempted
by
congress,
in
which
congress
itself
could
have
acted,
and
then
congress--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
course,
the
word
"mandate"
triggers
sensitive
nerves
in
the
tenth
amendment
area.
but
mandate
a
consideration,
particularly
in
a
circumstance
such
as
you
have
in
titles
i
and
iii
where
the
only
obligation
is
simply
to
consider
but
not
to
adopt
one
way
or
the
other--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
for
reasons
that
i
attempt
to
discuss,
we
believe
that
that
is
constitutional.
the
principal
reason
is,
aside
from
the
three
hurdles,
when
you
consider
the
balance
of
relevant
interests,
state
and
federal,
particularly
as
applied
to
this
kind
of
case,
it
is
not
that
much
of
an
intrusion,
certainly
not
an
unconstitutional
intrusion,
when
you're
dealing
in
areas
like
the
commerce
clause...
and
i
reiterate
that
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
turf
on
which
we
are
operating
is
federal
turf...
it
is
congressional
turf,
the
kind
of
regulatory
area
in
which
congress
could
legislate
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
instead,
what
congress
concluded
was
that
its
federal
purposes
would
be
better
served
if
it
permitted
the
states
to
consider
certain
basic
objectives,
not
to
adopt
them
but
simply
to
consider
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
duty
to
consider
the
title
i
and
iii
standards
is
vested
in
the
secretary.
and
the
mechanism
is
as
follows.
there
is
the
authority
in
the
secretary
as
to
both
title
i
and
title
iii
to
intervene
before
the
state
regulatory
proceedings.
in
the
event
that
the
matter
then
proceeds
to
court,
as
to
title
i
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
participate
as
a
party
as
an
intervenor.
as
to
title
iii,
with
respect
to
gas,
he
has
the
authority
to
participate
only
as
an
amicus.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
state
courts.
and
whatever
courts
properly
review
the
proceedings...
whatever
courts
the
states
have
designated
as
those
that
are
proper
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
suppose
the
secretary
could
appear
and
suggest
they
are
under
a
legal
obligation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
then
they
reject
him.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
as
i
read
the
statute,
what
it
is
talking
about
is
that
in
the
event
that
it
is
taken
to
state
court,
he
does
have
the
right
to
take--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--right.
the
way
the
act
handles
that,
justice
white,
is
that
in
the
event
that
the
regulatory
agency
does
not
consider
it,
then
in
the
next
rate
proceeding,
which
is
basically
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
to...
well,
whether
adjudicatory
or
legislative...
in
the
next
rate
proceeding,
it
must
consider
it
at
that
time.
now,
there
is,
of
course,--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
is
always
that
possibility
that
it
can
simply
decide
not
to.
we
assume,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
states
recognize
the
rule
of
law
and
that
this
is
an
area
of
federal
authority,
that
they
will
conform
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
apparently
not.
there
is
a--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no.
apparently,
the
only
authority
that
the
secretary
has
to
enforce
through
federal
court
is
his
right
to
intervene
in
state
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
my
opponent,
i
am
sure,
would
say
that
it
does
impose
more
extensive
obligations
than
that.
the
obligations
that
are
imposed
on
the
state
that
are
to
be
balanced
against
the
very
substantial
interest
that
the
federal
government
has
in
regulating
its
energy
program
with
concomitant
consequences
not
only
on
energy
savings
themselves
but
on
no
such
lesser
interests
as
inflation,
interstate
commerce
and
national
security
are
as
follows.
on
the
one
hand,
the
state
must
consider
it;
it
must
hold
hearings,
must
give
public
notice.
second,
it
must
give
written
determination
or
written
statements
concerning
its
reasons.
in
the
event
that
it
decides
not
to
adopt
one
of
the
title
i
or
title
iii
standards,
then
it
must
give
written
statement
of
the
reasons
to
do
so.
and
finally,
the
fourth
is
that
it
has
to
report
on
an
annual
basis
for
ten
years.
and
that's
it
under
title
i
and
title
iii.
now,
with
regard
to
section
210...
this,
as
i
say,
is
where
we
go
beyond
considering
and
actually
having
to
do
something...
it
would
be
anomalous
in
the
extreme,
i
submit,
to
hold
the
surface
mining
act,
held
constitutional
last
term,
constitutional,
and
at
the
same
time
hold
an
act
unconstitutional
which
was
enacted
as
a
compromise
in
direct
response,
in
direct
reaction,
to
federalism
interests
asking
for
lesser
intrusion
in
the
state
prerogatives
and
hold
it
unconstitutional
in
the
name
of
the
tenth
amendment,
which
of
course
preserves
state
prerogatives.
because,--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--two
answers
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
the
first
is
i
don't
think
it
was
harder
because
while
both
of
them
are
complex
pieces
of
legislation,
the
basic
approach
as
to
the
surface
mining
act
was
that
state
plans
were
submitted
to
the
secretary,
and
if
they
were
acceptable,
then
the
states
could
regulate.
otherwise,
the
state
took
over
and
regulated
directly.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me,
the
federal
government
took
over
and
regulated
directly.
but
the
more
persuasive
distinction
is
that
whatever
the
distinction,
whatever
the
comparative
intrusion
on
state
interests,
i
think
the
best
judge
of
that
has
to
be
the
states
themselves.
and
it
was
organizations
such
as
the
national
association
of
regulatory
utility
commissioners
and
others
that
presented
extensive
testimony
before
the
senate
saying
do
not
adopt
the
virginia
surface
mining
model
because
if
you
do,
three
things
will
happen.
one
is
it
will
be
a
greater
than
necessary
intrusion
in
the
state
prerogatives;
number
two,
we
need
the
flexibility
in
this
area
of
electric
generation
regulation
to
make
adaptation
for
the
differences
that
exist
from
one
locality
to
the
other;
and
the
final
one
is
we
need
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
experiment.
it
was
in...
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
the
house
bill
had
passed
it
would
be
constitutional.
my
opponents
concede
that
it
was
a
virginia
surface
mining
type
statute.
the
reason
that
the
house
bill
did
not
pass
was
because
the
advocates
of
federalism
came
in
and
said,
this
is
too
much
of
an
intrusion
under
our
prerogatives.
the
other
matter
that
needs
to
be
mentioned
in
this
respect--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
one
thing
i
haven't
checked
into,
justice
brennan.
[laughter]
but
it
is
significant
in
that
respect
that
the
group
that
is
perhaps
the
most
intensely
affected,
the
regulatory
commissioners
themselves,
were
at
the
forefront
of
this
plea,
don't
adopt
the
virginia
surface
mining
model,
and
they
were
also
the
ones
who
praised
before
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
the
approach
that
was
followed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
so
that
they
could
win
in
this
lawsuit.
[laughter]
at
least
if
they
did,
they
did
a
very
sophisticated
job
of
it
in
presenting
their
evidence
before
the
congress.
i'd
like
to
deal
now
with
the
compliance
by
the
states
with
the
section
210
requirements
for
the
sale
of
surplus
power
and
the
purchase
of
backup
power.
there
are
three
opportunities;
there
are
three
ways
that
the
states
are
given
to
comply,
and
the
third
one,
of
course,
is
the
very
broad
one,
"any
other
means"
by
which
the
policies
of
the
federal
regulation
may
be
obtained.
but
one
of
those
options
is
simply
to
entertain
disputes
between
regulated
utilities
on
the
one
hand
and
qualifying
facilities,
cogeneration
or
small
power
production
facilities,
on
the
other
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
thus
viewed,
all
that
section
210,
as
certainly
as
implemented
by
the
ferc
regulations,
does
is
simply
to
provide
a
federal
rule
of
decision
that
is
applicable
in
those
cases
where
the
state
entertains
lawsuits
for
other
type
of
adjudicatory
proceedings.
thus
viewed,
regardless
of
what
the
constitutional
rule
might
be
in
the
event
that
regulations
had
been
required,...
in
further
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question...
or
that
legislation
had
been
required,
that
obligation
can
be
performed,
can
be
satisfied,
simply
by
entertaining
disputes.
and
that
brings
the
case
squarely
within
this
court's
holding
in
testa
v.
katt,
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional
for
the
federal
government,
for
congress,
to
supply
the
rule
of
decision
applicable
in
state
adjudicatory
proceedings
so
long
as
that
same
kind
of
rule,
if
enacted
as
a
source
of
state
law,
would
be
constitutional.
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
comparative
weight
of
the
federal
and
the
state
interests
in
this
case.
this
case
demonstrates
better
than
either
of
predecessor
the
wisdom
of
what
this
court
implied
in
national
league
of
cities
and
towns,
and
expressly
stated
in
the
virginia
surface
mining
case,
that
the
federal
interest...
that
regardless
of
the
three
tests,
that
the
federal
interest
nevertheless
may
be
such
that
it
justifies
state
submission.
on
the
federal
side
of
the
balance
scale,
it
would
be
impossible
to
overstate
the
magnitude
of
this
nation's
energy
problem.
it's
important
not
only
in
its
own
right,
but
also
because
of
its
effect
on
inflation,
the
environment,
interstate
trade
and
national
security.
our
opponents
have
said
that
it's
in
the
future,
and
that
it's
not
something
that
congress
has
to
deal
with
yet.
i
submit
that
congress
is
to
be
praised,
rather
than
its
statute
to
be
held
unconstitutional
simply
because
it
anticipated
and
dealt
with
the
problem
before
we
have,
once
again,
such
severe
problems
as
we
have
had
in
the
past.
the
other
side
of
the
balance
scale
is
the
adverse
effect
on
state
interests.
i
submit
that
for
reasons
discussed,
these
are
minimal
as
to
titles
i
and
iii;
they
require
only
consideration.
and
as
to
section
210,
since
they
can
be
satisfied
by
a
means
that
has
already
been
validated
by
this
court
in
testa
v.
katt,
the
comparative
balance
between
state
and
federal
interests
clearly
favors
the
constitutionality.
and
finally,
this
statute
is
a
proper
exercise
of
congress'
national
security
powers.
the
linkage
between
national
security
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other,
the
dependence
on
foreign
oil
in
this
case
and
controlling
the
price
of
timber
sales
involved
in
case
v.
bowles
greatly
favors
the
balance
in
this
particular
case.
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue
have
uniformly
upheld
congressional
statutes
enacted
in
the
interest
of
national
security
when
attacked
on
tenth
amendment
grounds.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
two
brief
matters.
first
of
all,
the
ferc
regulations
were
promulgated
in
february
of
1980.
second,
and
finally,
aside
from
whatever
this
court's
decision
in
national
league
of
cities
and
towns
v.
usery,
may
mean
in
another
context,
we
simply
submit
that
it
should
not
apply
whereas
here,
you
have
a
true
example
of
cooperative
federalism,
where
congress
is
sharing
some
of
its
authority
with
the
states
in
the
interest
of
both
federal
and
state
government
and
out
of
plea
in
response
to
the
request
of
the
states.
and
that,
at
a
minimum,
must
be
what
this
court's
articulation
of
a
balancing
test,
both
in
national
league
of
cities
and
towns
and
also
in
hodel,
means.
with
regard
to
titles
i
and
iii,
congress
clearly
could
have
set
the
rates
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so.
what
an
anomaly
it
would
be
if
the
tenth
amendment
were
to
become
the
vehicle
for
preventing
congress
from
responding
to
state
pleas
for
flexibility
and
experimentation
in
the
perceived
interest
of
both
federal
and
state
governments
to
give
states
a
larger
role
in
that
particular
governmental
function.
with
regard
to
section
210,
mr.
alston
distinguished
testa
v.
katt
on
the
ground
that
no
state
functions
were
displaced.
really,
they
haven't
been
here,
either.
the
states
are
given
several
options
as
to
what
they
can
do,
but
they
are
not
required
to
bring
into
existence
any
new
entity
of
government.
they
are
not
required
to
have
any
of
their
existing
public
service
commissions
perform
any
functions
that
they
are
not
now
performing.
the
obligation
imposed
by
section
210
and
the
implementing
regulations
can
be
performed
by
simply
entertaining
disputes
before
appropriate
adjudicatory
entities.
and
that
does
not
mean
that
any
new
entity
must
be
brought
into
existence.
that
point
is
made,
for
example,
with
respect
to
nebraska,
which
has
no
public
utility
commission
with
authority
to
set
rates.
in
nebraska,
presumably,
that
responsibility
can
be
performed
simply
by
entertaining
that
kind
of
suit
before
the
courts.
and
that,
at
a
very
minimum,
is
what
testa
v.
katt
says.
and
in
that
respect,
testa
v.
katt
is
indistinguishable,
that
states
are
simply
required
to
observe
a
federal
rule
of
decision
that
is
prescribed
by
the
federal
government
but
to
be
observed
in
state
proceedings.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
and
clearly,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
federal
government
has
the
authority
under
the
spending
clause
to
impose
that
kind
of
an
obligation
on
the
states,
then
clearly,
under
its--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
the
spending
clause
or
the
commerce
clause.
then
clearly,
if
you
take
into
account
the
kind
of
balancing
and
recognition
of
the
comparative
weights
of
federal
and
state
interests,
particularly
where
in
many
instances,
in
the
view
of
many
states
in
this
case,
they
are
identical,
then
congress
certainly,
in
light
of
that
balancing
approach,
should
have
that
kind
of
flexibility.
and
if
it
has
that
kind
of
power
under
the
taxing
and
spending
and
the
commerce
clauses
over
a
55
mile
an
hour
speed
limit,
then
clearly,
under
its
powers
over
national
security
it
should
have
the
flexibility
to
deal
in
as
cooperative
federalism
approach
as
it
has
in
1978.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
of
course,
those
are
problems
that
will
have
to
be
worked
out
on
a
case-by-case
basis
as
those
matters
come
before
the
state.
since
most
of
the
proceedings
are
going
to
be
in
state
court,
it
is
not
the
article
iii
case
or
controversy
requirement
that
will
apply,
but
rather,
state
rules.
and
in
my
view,
they're
governed
by
state
law.
thank
you.
