mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
probably
the
best
place
to
start
with
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
purpa
would
be
look
at
the
act
itself.
the
solicitor
general
went
through
the
act
with
some
detail,
and
the
mechanics
of
the
act
that
he
did
discuss
i
do
not
disagree
with.
however,
this
is
certainly
more
than
just
simply
a
suggestion
to
the
state
of
mississippi
on
how
to
regulate
their
public
service
commission.
it's
certainly
more
than
just
a
study
telling
the
public
service
commission
what
to
do.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
findings
they
found
that
this
did
have
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
if
indeed
they
found
that
the
act
itself
was
reasonable
to
affect
the
utilities
themselves,
then
perhaps
they
could
do
that.
it
may
be
absolutely
so.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
they
may
could
have
preempted
the
area.
but
in
the
field
of
federalism,
if
we
talk
about
federalism,
that
does
not
destroy
the
principles
of
federalism.
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general.
if
the
federal
government
takes
over
an
area,
if
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
take
over
that
area
in
the
constitution
if
it's
permissible
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
federal
government
at
that
point
carries
the
burden;
they
are
the
responsible
party
to
exercise
that
law.
one
of
the
great
principles
of
federalism,
as
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
i
can
look
to
my
public
officials.
we
elect
our
public
service
commissioners.
i
can
look
to
them
to
implement,
to
promulgate
state
law.
i
do
not
want
for
them
to
implement
federal
law.
i
have
no
control
over
that.
it's
deceptively
simple
to
say,
when
they
are
looking
at
a
statute
like
this,
to
say
well,
this
is
good.
a
transient
majority
of
congress
may
say
look,
this
is
very
good
for
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
what
we'll
do
is
we're
going
to
tell
the
state
of
mississippi
what
they
are
going
to
do.
that
makes
it
easy.
but
it
completely
destroys
the
concept
of
federalism.
i'm
not
looking
now
to
my
public
service
commissioners
to
implement
state
law.
the
public
service
commission
is
the
one
that
gets
called
when
the
rates
go
up.
the
burdens
should
not
be
placed
on
them
unless
they
have
consented
to,
by
the
electorate
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
they
completely
set
up
an
agenda
for
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
i
was
just
going
to
go
over
that
before
the
question
was
asked
by
mr.
chief
justice.
it
starts
out
in
section
111,
"the
state
of
mississippi
is
ordered.
"
you
are
hereby
required...
section
111
says...
to
consider
very,
very
complicated
rate-making
standards.
okay.
section
113
says
"you
must"
you
are
absolutely
required,
public
service
commission,
to
consider
all
of
these
other
standards,
six
or
eight
standards.
turning
now
to
302,
303
in
the
gas
section,
it
says
"you
must"
consider
all
of
these
standards.
not
only
that,
if
the
court
please,
it
tells
you
the
procedure.
it
sets
the
agenda
for
my
public
service
commission,
tells
of
the
procedures
that
i
have
to
follow.
also,
if
these
procedures
disagree
with
what
the
procedures
of
the
act
are,
they
override
state
law.
it's
interesting,
too,
the
act
says,
that
the
purposes
of
this
act
supplement
state
law.
difficult
to
me
to
see
how
the
federal
government
can
supplement
the
state
law
to
give
our
public
service
commissioners
additional
discretion.
but
the
act
goes
further.
they
mandate,
they
order
that
we
do
this,
they
tell
the
procedures
that
we're
going
to
have
to
follow.
in
addition
to
that,
if
you
turn
to
section
115,
if
the
court
please,
it
says,
here's
the
evidence
you've
got
to
look
at
when
you
consider
these
standards.
you
go
to
210...
210
is
not
just
a
minor
section
of
the
act.
it
says
the
state
tax
commission
shall
give
notice
and
hearing
and
implement
the
rules
as
promulgated
by
the
federal
government,
in
connection
with
210.
as
far
as
any
enforcement
of
the
act
is
concerned,
i
submit
that
the
solicitor
general
was
just
wrong
in
his
answer
to
the
court,
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
section
123
it
says
any
person
can
enforce
upon
the
state
tax
commission
what
the
act
is
about.
you
turn
to
the
conference
report,
and
i
just
happened
to
open
to
it
when
the
solicitor
general
was
speaking...
the
conference
report
says
specifically,
this
enforcement
provision
of
obligation
of
state
regulatory
authorities
and
non-regulated
utilities
to
hold
hearings,
to
make...
comply...
requirements
a
and
b.
they
are
reviewable
under
the
orders
of
this
court,
and
they
may
be
forced...
the
enforcement
provision
contemplates
enforcement
by
writs
of
mandamus.
furthermore,
under--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes.
the
act,
in
123,
if
the
court
please,
says
they
can
enforce
these
provisions;
any
person
can
enforce
these
provisions.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
don't
know,
except
what
the
conference
report
says,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
white,
the
conference
report
says
they
can
enforce
it
by
writs
of
mandamus
or
other
proceedings.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes.
the
statute
says
any
person,
including
the
secretary,
speaking
of
the
secretary
of
energy
may
bring
an
action
to
enforce
the
requirements
of
this
title
in
the
appropriate
state
court.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
that's
exactly
the
way
i
read
it,
if
the
court
pleases.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
not
that
i
know
of.
furthermore,
under
section
210...
that's
under
titles
i
and
iii.
furthermore,
under
section
210
they
are
subject
to
civil
and
criminal
penalties,
they
are
subject
to
any
penalty
under
the
federal
power
act.
in
turning
to
the
federal
power
act,
refusal
to
comply
with
the
provisions
would
subject
you
to
the
penalties
under
that.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
believe
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes,
i
believe,
because...
mr.
justice
white,
are
you
talking
about
the
intervention
in
the
court
proceedings
and
appeal
from
that?
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
think
it
would.
the
fact
that
he
can
intervene
in
my
state
proceedings,
and
the
fact
that
this
is
not
consistent
with
the
law
of
the
state...
you
have
to
have
a
hearing,
a
determination,
whether
someone
can
intervene
in
any
state
proceedings,
if
the
court
please.
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
principles
and
the
procedures
of
our
courts.
and
then
if
he
could
appeal
any
of
these
decisions,...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
appeal
causes
me
some
concern,
mr.
justice
white,
because
if,
really
and
truly,
the
federal
government
didn't
care
whether
these
were
implemented
or
not,
if
they
did
care,
why
did
they
give
them
a
right
to
appeal?
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
guess
the
issue
on
appeal
would
be
whether
or
not
the
decision
of
the
public
service
commission
was
arbitrary
or
capricious
and
not
based
on
the
proper
standard,
if
the
court
please,
not
based
on
substantial
evidence.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
it
would
vary
from
state
to
state
except
that
the
procedure
itself
would
be
highly
changed
in
connection
with
the
state
in
the
proceeding
before
the
public
service
commission.
because
the
rules
of
evidence
and
every
other
part
of
it
would
go
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
action
was
reasonable
or
based
on
substantial
evidence.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
reviewable
under
the
act
all
the
way
up
to
the
united
states
supreme
court,
as
by
writs
of
certiorari
and
otherwise.
review
of
the
action
in
the
supreme
court
in
accordance
with
sections
1257
and
1258--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--a
federal
question
would
be
perhaps,
if
we
said
we
would
not
let
the
secretary
of
energy
intervene,
perhaps.
that--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--secondly,
if
the
court
please,
we
fail
to
follow
the
standards
as
set
out
in
115.
we
were
mandated
under
this
procedure
to
follow
the
federal
guidelines,
as
they
told
us.
we
failed
to
do
that.
it
may
be
a
federal
question
involved--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes,
you
do
have
a
routine.
if
you
take,
for
example,
the
master
metering
standard,
you
would
have
to
consider
the
master
metering
standard,
and
you're
required
to
do
it.
you
have
to
then--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--that's
true.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
think
the
rule
is
25
consumers
under
certain
procedures,
under
the
procedures
set
up
by
the
court,
could
come
in
and
ask
for
changes
in
the
rules
and
rate-making--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--i
don't
know
that
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes.
if
25
consumers
came
before
them,
they
would
have
to
make
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
they
wanted
to
proceed
further
with
whatever
was
before
them,
the
agency,
at
that
time.
if
it
please
the
court,
we
contend
that
this...
the
manner
in
which
this
act
was
written
is
most
unique.
they
did
not
follow,
the
federal
government
did
not
follow,
the
provisions
as
they
followed,
or
the
scheme
that
they
followed
in
all
of
the
other
regulatory
provisions.
they
gave
the
state
the
option
of
whether
or
not...
as
they
did
in
the
surface
mining
case,
if
the
court
please...
the
option
of
whether
or
not
they
would
desire
to
follow
the
procedures
or
not,
and
gave
them
the
right
to
get
out.
they
didn't
want
to.
under
those
circumstances,
the
federal
government,
at
that
point,
would
take
over
the
whole
administration
of
that
area.
this
is
entirely
different
from
what
we
are
talking
about
today.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
been
trying
to
find
some
statute
or
some
authority...
and
certainly
the
solicitor
general
hasn't
given
me
any
authority...
that
would
be
constitutional
where
a
statute
is
mandated
on
a
state
regulatory
commission
and
they
are
required
to
follow
the
mandates
of
that
statute.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
commandeer
the
public
service
commission's
machinery
into
going
about
this
act.
the
only
cases
that
i
think
i
saw
that
are
closest
to
it
were
the
epa
cases
that
came
up
to
this
court
in
epa
v.
brown.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
may
be
state
laws
that
forbid,
but
i
don't--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--there
may
be,
if
the
court
please,
statutes
that
forbid
state
agencies
from
doing
certain
things
where
there
is
a
conflict.
but
i
know
of
no
case.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
point
that
i--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
the
point
that
i
'm
trying
to
make,
i
know
of
no
statute
and
i
have
seen
no
case
where
affirmative
burdens
are
placed
on
an
administrative
agency
of
a
state.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any
statute
like
this.
the
closest
i
can
recall
are
the
epa
v.
brown
that
came
before
this
court.
as
you
recall,
in
that
case,
the--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--the
issue
was,
in
that
case,
whether
or
not
the
administrator
of
the
epa
could
require
the
state
to
implement
certain
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
the
solicitor
general
admitted
that
it
could
not
do
that,
and
therefore,
this
court
held,
i
believe,
in
1977
that
the
issue
was
moot.
the
only
other
time
that
i
can
recall
anything
that
has
been
considered,
if
the
court
please,
is
when
congress
was
attempting
to
pass
no-fault
insurance.
and
i
remember
that
the
then-attorney
general
edward
levy
was
asked
what
his
opinion
on
the
constitutionality
of
requiring
certain
affirmative
obligation
on
the
state,
and
he
was
quick
to
tell
congress
in
those
hearings
that
indeed,
they
could
not.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
think
section
(e)
could
have
been
passed
separately,
and
i
think
that
would
be
severable,
so
that
the
small
power
plants
and
the
cogeneration
could
be
exempted
from
the
federal
power
act.
i
would
think
that
primarily
210
was
executed
so
that
the
federal
government
would
implement
these
rules
and
the
states
were
forced
to
comply
with
these
rules
to
see
that
the
utilities
followed
the
federal
mandate.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
think
that
they
would
significantly
impair
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
public
service
commission
in
their
choices.
section
210,
they
have
not
chosen
to
go
into
the
area
that's
mentioned
in
section
210.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
don't
even
have
authority
to
go
into...
in
some
of
the
areas
that
are
mentioned
in
210,
they
have
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
over
interstate
rates.
for
example,
in
purchasing
power
from
a
small
power
plant,
that
would
be
an
interstate
transaction,
as
i
understand
the
law
on
it.
the
only
authority
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
has
would
be
to...
for
the
regulation
of
interstate
rates.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
do
i
consider
that
to
be
constitutional
under
the
tenth
amendment?
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
if
they
say
you
will
follow,
mississippi
public
service
commission,
you
will
follow
these
standards,
i
would
consider
that
to
be
an
impermissible
intrusion
on
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
of
any
such
law.
the
interstate
rates
that
are
promulgated
by
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
are
promulgated
under
the
authority
of
the
mississippi
public
service
commision,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
federal
law
that
would
change--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--i
would
think
if
there
were
a
finding
of
congress
that,
of
course,
that
intrastate
railroads
have
a
significant
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
and--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
and
they
preempted
that
area
of
regulation.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
under
those
circumstances,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
just
because...
and
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
on
this
point...
just
because
the
federal
government
could
preempt
an
area
that
is
in
its
constitutional
power
to
do--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--if
congress
wanted
to
preempt
the
area,
and
take
over
all
of
the
regulation
of
all
of
the
utilities
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
under
those
circumstances
of
course
they
could.
but
it's
a
different
thing
i
think,
your
honor.
i
think
it
touches
on
sovereignty,
the
very
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
action
is
directly
against
the
state
as
a
state,
it
touches
i
think
on
attributes
of
sovereignty.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
it's
a
possibility.
that's
not
putting
an
affirmative
burden.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
think
that
would
cross
the
line
and
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
well,
i
would
not--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--that
there
will
be
time-of-day
rates
across
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
that
perhaps
would
be
constitutional
if
that
was...
if
they
didn't
tell
the
state
tax
commission
how
they
had
to
implement
the
rules
or
how
they
had
to
go
about
the
rules
and
it
was
certainly
just
the
statement
that
everybody
had
to--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--i
don't
know
of
any
enforcement.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
more
attractive
or
not.
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
question.
i
know
it's
not
more
attractive
to
the
state
of
mississippi.
i
know
it's
not
more
attractive
to
the
state
of
louisiana,
that
also
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
no,
i'm
certainly
not
saying
federal
preemption
would
be
preferable.
but
i'm
making
the
distinction
in
opposition
to
what
the
solicitor
general.
he
said
if
you
could
preempt,
of
course,
you
have
authority
to
do
all
of
these
things
against
state
agencies.
i
say
that
just
does
not
follow.
certainly,
if
you
preempt
that
puts
the
burden
on
the
national
government.
under
our
system
of
federalism
i
know
who
to
look
to
for
my
rate
structure.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
but
what
it
does,
your
honor,
i
think
it
runs
completely
afoul
to
the
three
tests
of
hodel.
first,
they
are
telling
the
state
as
a
state
what
to
do.
certainly,--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--and
they're
telling
them
how
to
follow
it,
the
rules
they've
got
to
play,
what
they've
got
to
consider.
they've
got
to
let
anybody
intervene
under
the
rules.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
purposes
supplement
state
law,
the
procedures
would
override
state
law.
in
addition
to
that,
it
involves
attributes
of
state
sovereignty.
that's
the
paradigm
of
state
sovereignty,
the
ability
to
pass
laws
and
to
pass
regulations.
thirdly,
we
contend
that
it
significantly
impairs
the
ability
of
the
state--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
he
is.
of
course,
that's
under
a
spending
clause,
under
clauses
where
if
we
take
money
from
federal
funds,
we--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
would
be
to
enforce
the
mile
an
hour
speed
limit.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
if
it
was
not
tied
to
the
grant
to
federal
highways,
i
don't
know
that
he
would
be.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
necessary
that
it
enforce
that
obligation.
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can
force
a
state
officer
to
enforce
a
federal
regulation
of
that
nature.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
and
the
55
mile
speed
limit
is
applicable
to
all
of
them?
i
would
think
then
under
those
circumstances
that
he
would,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
i
think
we
all
are
bound
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
so.
we
are
bound
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
and
the
public
service
commission--
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
mandamus
is
an
old
remedy,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
have
followed
for
a
long
time.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
and
under
the
right
state
of
facts,
they
could.
mr.
alex
a.
alston,
jr.
mandamus
would
apply
if
the
public
service
commission
did
not
comply
with
administerial
duties
in
doing
certain
things;
the
writ
of
mandamus
may
just
apply.
in
conclusion,
i
just
wanted
to
state
that
certainly,
it's
no
question
the
government
recognizes
that
these
mandates
are
forced
on
state's
estates.
certainly,
the
right
to
make
the
laws
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
certainly
the
right
to
promulgate
the
regulations
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
is
an
attribute
of
sovereignty.
that
is
the
attribute
of
sovereignty.
we
further
contend
that
certainly,
this
impairs,
the
act
impairs
the
ability
of
the
state
of
mississippi
to
structure
its
integral
operations
in
area
of
traditional
functions,
and
this
is
indeed
a
traditional
function.
