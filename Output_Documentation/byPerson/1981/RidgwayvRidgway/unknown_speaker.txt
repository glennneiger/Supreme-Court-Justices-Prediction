unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
sure,
it's
a
little
irrelevant,
but
was
a
copy
of
the
decree,
the
divorce
decree
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
insurance
decree
before...
as
soon
as
it
was
entered,
or
soon
after
it
was
entered?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the...
i
suppose
your
answer
to
the
next
question
would
be
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
a
copy
of
the
decree
had
been
filed
with
the
armed
services
and
the
insurance
company.
unknown
speaker
and
that
authority...
that
authority
to
change
the
beneficiary
cannot
be
waived
or
diminished
by
the
insured
person?
unknown
speaker
and
the
procedures
and
forms
are
fully
complied
with
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
on
the
change.
unknown
speaker
did
the
sergeant
leave
an
estate
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
did
the
insured
sergeant
leave
an
estate,
a
probate
estate?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
there
is
an
action
for
breach
of
contract
against
the
estate,
you
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
enforceable
or
collectable.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
matter
of
irrelevance
to
you,
i
suppose.
it
would
be
of
some
concern
to
the
other
side.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
your
client
voluntarily
agreed
to
assign
the
proceeds
of
the
life
insurance
policy,
or
to
have
a
trust
imposed
on
them?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
see
what
you
mean
about
the
commas
and
clauses.
unknown
speaker
you
really
represent
prudential
then.
unknown
speaker
i'm
a
little
curious
as
to
why
prudential
is
so
involved
and
upset
and
concerned.
why
don't
they
pay
the
money
into
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
a
very
uncommon
situation
in
controversies
over
insurance
policy
proceeds,
and
insurers
are
always
paying
into
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
lot
less
time
and
energy
and
expense
than
your
coming
all
the
way
here
defending
it.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
i
just--
unknown
speaker
--does
the
maine
interpleader
statute
provide
for
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees
on
behalf
of
the
interpleader?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beale,
in
this
case,
on
the
holding
below,
supposing
you
paid
a
couple
of
months
of
benefits
to
the
wrong
party,
the
theory
of
the
court
below
wouldn't
hold
you
responsible
for
paying
the
price,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
stuck
to
the
theory
of
the
court
below,
you
don't
really
have
a
risk
of
double
exposure.
unknown
speaker
at
least
not--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
not
discussed.
unknown
speaker
how
could
that
party
possibly
recover
against
you
for
merely
doing
what
the
policy
directed
you
to
do?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
unknown
speaker
--is
this...
i'm
interested
in
justice
blackmun's
point.
is
this
problem
any
different
because
it's
a
federal
insurance,
i
mean,
you
know,
the
federal
government's
involved,
than
in
any
of
the
other
countless
situations
in
which
insurance
companies
always
have
the
risk
of
paying
the
wrong
party?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
the
arguments
in
favor
of
your
position.
i'm
not
asking
that.
assuming
you
lost
here
and
we
said
none
of
that
really
applied,
then
wouldn't
you
have
precisely
the
same
practical
problems
that
you
have
in
your
regular
insurance
business?
unknown
speaker
you're
asking
us
to
construe
the
statute
in
the
way
that
will
save
you
a
lot
of
administrative
costs
that
you
have
in
the
rest
of
your
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
those
are
reasons
why
you
may
be
right,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
if
you're
wrong
on
the
law--
unknown
speaker
--and
i'm
not
suggesting
you
are...
you
would
just
end
up
having
the
same
kind
of
practical
problem
you
do
with
the
rest
of
your
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
big
insurance
companies
have
an
enormous
number
of
policies
outstanding
normally.
unknown
speaker
to
put
it
in
another
way,
prudential
has
no
financial
stake
in
this
except
the
litigation
expense.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
$10,000.
unknown
speaker
the
stake.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
go
into
the
insurance
business?
unknown
speaker
i
still
have
great
problem
with
your
only
right
being
administrative
convenience.
unknown
speaker
that's
all,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
how
many
interpleader
cases
does
prudential
file
in
a
year?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
thousands,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
this
would
just
be
a
drop
in
the
bucket,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
only
purpose
is
you
just
don't
want
to
go
through
the
formality
of
an
interpleader
suit?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
are
here
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
quite
in
agreement
with
you,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
so
how
are
you
representing
them
and
they
don't
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
your...
it's
a
problem
that
prudential
just
doesn't
want
to
go
through
the
ordinary
interpleader
suit.
well,
i
ask,
would
the
interpleader
suit
solve
this?
unknown
speaker
it
could
have.
unknown
speaker
and
been
free
and
clear
to
do
whatever
it
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
this
is
out
of
the
goodness
of
prudential's
heart.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
don't
have
to
bother
us
with
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
beale,
what
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
change
of
beneficiaries,
and
the
first
beneficiary
alleged
that
the
second
beneficiary
had
caused
the
decedent
to
change
the
beneficiaries
by
use
of
duress
or
fraud
or
something
of
that
character,
and
so
there
really
wasn't
a
voluntary
choice?
what
would
you
do
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
plight?
would
you
say
you
must
pay
the
allegedly...
notwithstanding
the
allegedly...
the
alleged
fraud?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
way
of...
say
a
man
just,
he
changed
the
beneficiaries
at
the
point
of
a
gun
or
something
like
that
was
alleged,
he
still...
the
second
beneficiary
still
gets
the
money?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest,
mr.
beale,
that
we
can't
decide
against
you
without
overruling
wissner?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
an
nsli,
too,
and
not--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
repeat
my
question:
do
you
think
we
can
decide
against
you
without
overruling
wissner?
unknown
speaker
there's
another
difference,
too,
in
that
the
policy
holder
there
had
not
made
any
commitment
not
to
designate
anybody
else
as
a
beneficiary,
but
here
he
did.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
that's
a
difference
between
the
two
cases.
unknown
speaker
wissner,
there
was
only
one
beneficiary
designation.
the
question
was
whether
it
was
a
good
one.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
distributed
with...
in
accordance
with
the
intent
of
congress,
don't
you
actually
mean
with
the
intent,
in
accordance
with
the
intent
of
the
serviceman?
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't
his
designation
of
willingness
to
continue
the
policy
in
force
for
the
children
in
effect
an
expression
of
willingness
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
would
the
government's
view
be
different
if
it
had
received
the
necessary
writing
required
by
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
puzzles,
that
argument
puzzles
me
a
little
because
there
was
a
clear,
unambiguous
designation
of
the
first
wife
as
the
beneficiary.
unknown
speaker
of
the
first
wife
as
the
beneficiary,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
prior
to
the
divorce.
unknown
speaker
so
that
what...
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
the
case
would
be
any
different
if
you
received
an
amendment
saying,
well,
instead
of
going
just
to
the
wife,
going
to
the
wife
for
the
benefit
of
the
children,
isn't
it
still
the
same
case?
unknown
speaker
your
view,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
statute
gives
the
man
the
absolute
right
to
change
beneficiaries
no
matter
how
faithfully
he
has
promised
not
to
do
so
and
how
many
courts
have
ordered
him
not
to
do
so.
he
has
a
federal
right
to
change
beneficiary
in
breach
of
a
separation
agreement.
unknown
speaker
would
the
supremacy
clause
help?
unknown
speaker
are
you
resting
that
on
some
theory
that
the
insured
is
not
free
to
change
the
beneficiary
under
this
statute,
under
this
statutory
scheme?
is
he
or
is
he
not
free
to
change
any
time
he
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
one
of
the
reasons
they're
here
is
because
we
granted
their
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
reasons
they're
here.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
put
that
in
the
affirmative,
if
they
informed
him
that
he
was
always
free
to
change
the
beneficiary
at
any
time
he
wanted
under
all
conditions.
anything
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
that's
true
when
you
buy
private
life
insurance,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
add
to
the
hypothetical
that
when
the
recruiter
approaches
him,
his
wife
is
with
him?
do
you
think
that
the
statement
that
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
the
recruiter
make
would
give
her
a
brighter
vision
of
military
service?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
mean,
wouldn't
she
be
somewhat
upset
knowing
that...
and
perhaps
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
entering
the
military
service
if
she
knew
that
he
could
change
the
beneficiary
on
the
policy
regardless
of
any
estate
law
policy
or
interest
that
she
might
otherwise
accrue
in
the
policy?
unknown
speaker
when
that
statute
was
passed,
weren't
there
draftees?
weren't
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
you
able
to
resist
the
draft
on
the
grounds
that
you
didn't
like
the
life
insurance
policy?
[laughter]
was
that
a
good
ground?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
bound
by
his
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
webber,
let
me
ask
you,
is
there
an
estate
of
the
decedent
in
existence?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
far
as
you
understand.
don't
you
know?
unknown
speaker
and
you
came
into
this
case
only
by
our
appointments
at
a
fairly
recent
date,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
how
long
have
you
been
in
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
we
just
confirmed
an
appointment
that
had
been
made
before.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
suppose
that
the
sergeant
was
limited
in
his
recognition
of
credit
and
to
all
of
his
creditors
he
indicated,
oh,
i
have
a
national
service
life
insurance
policy
and
i
have
made
it
payable
to
my
estate,
and
i
shall
not
change
that
designation.
does
your
theory
of
the
case
go
so
far
as
to
protect
creditors?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
draw
the
line
as
between
a
first
wife,
or
children,
rather,
and
creditors?
unknown
speaker
over
a
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
there
you
have
evidence
of
conduct
which
interfered
with
the
will
and
desire
of
the
insured.
you
don't
have
that
here.
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
a
case
where
equitable
principles
ran
up
against
the
sovereignty
clause,
the
supremacy
clause?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
kind
of
case
i'd
be
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
okay.
i
missed
it.
it's
not
the
first
one
i
missed.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
one
place.
where
is
it
cited
one
place
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
three--
unknown
speaker
--you
also
cite
hisquierdo
as
saying
that,
too.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
i
missed
it.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
the
other
side
says
that's
different,
a
community
state,
property
state
is
different
from
maine.
isn't
that
their
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
was
isn't
that
their
position,
not
that
i
agree
with
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
difference
is,
is
it
not...
and
i'm
not
an
authority
on
community
property
law...
but
is
the
difference
that
at
the
time
that
they
are
alive
they
owned
the
property
jointly,
which
is
not
true
in
maine.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you're
suggesting
that
although
normally
the
premiums
are
paid
by
withholding
from
the
serviceman's
pay,
i
guess
these
policies
often
continue
after
the
man
leaves
service,
and
presumably
he
could
pay
the
premiums,
the
wife
might...
made
an
agreement
to
have
the
wife
pay
the
premiums,
you
have
the
same
sort
of
facts
you
had
in
yiatchos,
the
wife
pay
the
premiums
on
the
understanding
he
wouldn't
change
the
beneficiary,
then
he
go
ahead
and
change
it.
but
the
government
says
there's
a
federal
interest
in
letting
him
change
the
beneficiary,
even
though
the
wife
pays
the
premium,
and
he
agrees
that
that's
in
the
consideration
he
won't
change
it.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
thinking
out
loud,
i
guess,
but
that's
your
analogy.
i
think
you're
trying
to
make
the
analogy
that
even
in
a
case...
that
in
that
case,
because
the
wife
contributed
to
the
purchase
of
the
bonds,
it
was
a
fraud
on
her
to...
for
him
to
claim
the
full
benefit,
and
the
same
kind
of
thing
could
happen
with
insurance.
that's
your
argument
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
washington.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
wissner
was
decided
in
about
1949.
unknown
speaker
i
agree,
it's
not
dispositive,
but
it
represents
a
trend
in
the
laws.
unknown
speaker
well,
with
four
million
or
more
veterans,
most
of
whom
have
this
insurance,
and
many
of
whom
get
divorces,
i
suppose
it's
filtered
around
rather
widely.
unknown
speaker
sometimes
that
is
done,
is
it
not,
as
part
of
a
divorce
settlement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
webber,
we
are
speaking
practicalities
now.
with
a
private
policy
i
think
one
can
have
a
beneficiary
designation
made
irrevocable,
and
get
the
policy
turned
over
to
the
wife,
then
wife.
is
there
anything
comparable
on
the
governmental
side?
is
there
a
certificate
that
has
to
be
turned
in,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
file
a
form,
but
is
there
also
a
certificate
that
has
to
go
in,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
comparable
to
the
private
policy
then.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
question
of
unjust
enrichment
a
question
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
hasn't
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
maine
decided
it?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
hold
that
there
was
unjust
enrichment
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
they
committed
all
sorts
of
errors
of
state
law,
but
normally
we
don't
review
those.
unknown
speaker
but
again,
is
that
relevant?
would
you
agree
with
his
example
of
say
you've
got
a
beneficiary
who
murders
the
policyholder?
what
about
that
case?
unknown
speaker
the
murderer?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
hold,
that
in
that
case,
as
this,
pay
the
murderer.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
solve
the
insurance
company's
problem
if
the
trust
didn't
arise
except
in
the
hands
of
the
named
beneficiary.
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
would
be
off
the
hook
if
you
paid
the
named
beneficiary,
but
then
the
trust
would
pick
up
on
the
proceeds
in
her
hands.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday
next
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
