justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
an
insured
serviceman's
beneficiary
designated
under
a
life
policy
issued
pursuant
to
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
of
1965
prevails
over
a
constructive
trust
imposed
upon
the
policy
proceeds
by
a
state-court
decree.
it
is
another
in
a
line
of
recent
cases
that
concerns
the
impact
of
state
law
or
state
judgments
upon
statutorily
created
federal
rights.
this
is
a
dispute
over
the
proceeds
of
a
serviceman's
policy.
on
the
one
side
of
the
serviceman's
first
wife
and
their
children
and
on
the
other,
his
second
wife,
who
was
his
widow
at
his
death.
each
claimed
the
policy
proceeds.
the
former's
claim
rested
on
a
divorce
decree
of
a
maine
court.
and
the
widow's
claim
rested
on
the
beneficiary
designation
and
her
status
as
widow.
the
trial
court
felt
that
the
imposition
of
a
constructive
trust
on
the
policy
proceeds
would
interfere
with
the
operation
of
a
federal
act
and
would
run
afoul
of
the
supremacy
clause.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
ruled
otherwise
and
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
in
turn
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine.
we
hold
that
the
insured's
beneficiary
designation
prevails
over
the
constructive
trust
imposed
upon
the
policy
proceeds
by
the
state
court.
as
a
consequence
of
the
supremacy
clause,
a
state
divorce
decree,
like
other
law
governing
the
economic
aspects
of
domestic
relations,
must
give
way
to
clearly
conflicting
federal
enactments.
the
provision
of
the
act
according
the
insured
service
members
certain
rights
prevail
over
and
displace
inconsistent
state
law.
the
imposition
of
a
constructive
trust
on
the
insurance
proceed
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
anti-attachment
provision
of
the
act.
a
result
of
this
kind,
of
course,
may
be
avoided
if
congress
chooses
to
avoid
it.
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
congress.
but
thus
far,
congress
has
insulated
the
proceeds
of
this
insurance
from
attachment
or
seizure
by
any
claimant
other
than
the
beneficiary
designated
by
the
insured
or
the
one
first
in
line
under
the
statutory
order
of
precedence
of
beneficiaries.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissent
and
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
