mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
program,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case,
is
an
important
feature
of
the
united
states
military
personnel
policy,
which
was
adopted
with
the
intention
that
it
alleviate
a
unique
hardship
of
military
service,
which
is
the
simple
fact
that
meaningful
commercial
life
insurance
is
not
available
to
servicemen
protecting
them
against
the
thing
that
their
loved
ones
most
need,
that
is,
the
extra
hazards
of
military
service
in
combat
conditions
or
other
war
hazards.
the
program
was
adopted
to
boost
morale
of
service
members
by
making
available
a
safe,
convenient,
sure
form
of
insurance
protection
for
anyone
that
the
service
member
might
choose
to
favor
with
these
benefits.
as
of
the
moment,
there
are
over
3
million
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
policies
in
effect,
and
the
insured
service
members
live
in
all
50
states
in
the
united
states.
the
united
states
has
participated
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
in
this
court
because
it
has
substantial
interest
in
ensuring
that
the
proceeds
of
policies
issued
under
this
program
are
distributed
in
accordance
with
the
intentions
of
the
congress,
and
it
might
be
appropriate
to
suggest
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
early
out
to
mr.
beale,
that
while
we
do
not,
the
government
is
not
here
speaking
particularly
for
richard
ridgway,
i
suppose
that
we
are
closest
to
that
status
in
the
sense
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
is
essentially
the
interest
of
service
members
generally.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes.
we
read
the
statute,
and
we
think
it
is
quite
plain
on
its
face
that
what
congress
intended
is
that
whatever
the
service
member
intended
be
followed
through
so
that
the
two
merge
in
this
case,
in
the
instance
where
the
service
member
has
designated
a
beneficiary.
in
the
government's
view,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
fails
to
accord
proper
scope
and
effect
to
two
provisions
of
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
which
effectively
grant
each
service
member
insured
under
this
program
the
right
to
determine
who
should
determine
the
proceeds
of
his,
his
or
her
insurance
policy,
and
to
insulate
those
proceeds
from
any
form
of
collateral
attack
whatsoever.
the
first
provision
of
the
act
which
is
in
our
view
significant
here
is
the
provision
which
provides,
as
i
was
just
discussing,
that
the
service
member
has
the
prerogative
to
designate
any
person
to
take
the
proceeds
of
the
insurance,
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
congress
understood
quite
clearly
that
this
was
a
broad
leave
to
the
servicemen.
on
the
floor
of
the
congress,
represent
everett
as
quoted
in
our
brief,
stated,
this
bill
permits
you
to
leave
your
insurance
to
your
church,
your
college,
or
to
your
best
friend.
clearly
congress
had
no
illusions
as
to
the
scope
of
the
license
accorded
the
service
member.
in
so
doing,
congress
further
went
on
to
provide
that
if
no
designation
were
made,
the
proceeds
be
paid
in
the
first
instance
to
a
widow
or
widower,
in
the
second
instance
if
no
such
widow
or
widower
were
available,
to
any
surviving
children
or
descendents
of
those
children,
then
on
to
a
parent,
and
finally,
the
last
two
options
were
to
the
executor
or
administrator
of
an
estate
or
to
any
next
of
kin
prescribed
in
accordance
with
state
law.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
that
may
well
be,
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
fails
to
accord
with
the
statutory
standard
in
several
respects.
in
the
first
instance,
the
statute
provides
that
the
designation,
to
be
effective,
must
be
received
in
writing
in
the
service
office.
furthermore,
the
regulations
which
were
adopted
contemporaneously
with
the
initial
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
which
are
due
some
deference,
have
been
continuously
in
force
for
fifteen
or
so
years
now,
provide
that
the
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
is
retained
at
all
times,
and
we
believe
this
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
language
which
expressly
provides
that
the
benefits
be
paid
to
whomsoever
he
designates,
and
that
therefore
he
has
the
right
to
change
his
mind.
but
whether
or
not
that
is
true,
the
additional
point
which
was
raised
earlier
was
the
fact
that
this
was
not
receiving
in
writing.
in
fact,
although
the
record
is
somewhat
unclear
on
this
point
and
the
government
obviously
has
no
view
on
the
matter,
it
appears
that
there
was
not
in
fact,
likely
was
not
a
written
separation
agreement,
so
there
is
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
designation
of
intent
in
that
respect,
and--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--no.
the
government's
view
would
be
the
same,
but
we
would
think
it
a
closer
case.
for
instance,
it
might
be
reasonable...
and
we
would
think
it
might
be
reasonably
done
by
congress,
if
congress
deems
it
appropriate...
congress
could
provide
that
in
the
event
that
a
separation
agreement
is
entered,
particularly
if
it
were
embodied
in
a
divorce
decree,
that
a
registered
copy,
certified
by
the
clerk
of
the
court,
duly
filed
with
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
office
in
newark,
new
jersey,
providing
that
there
be
an
irrevocable
designation
might
have
that
effect.
now,
obviously
those
aren't
the
facts
here
both
because
that
is
not
what
occurred
and
that
congress
hasn't
done
so,
and
we
would
think
it
is
congress's
prerogative
to
do
that.
but
in
any
event,
there
isn't
a
clear,
written,
unambiguous,
final
assertion
of
intent
so
that
while
we
think
the
case
is
somewhat
harder
because
of
the
oral
separation
agreement,
we
don't
think
that
would
be
dispositive
here.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
of--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--prior
to
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
clearly
on
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
would
suggest
that
that
is
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
as
an
alternative
argument,
we
would
suggest
that
if...
if
the
effect
of
a
court
order
is
to
somehow
limit
that...
and
we
would
suggest
that
a
state
court
doesn't
have
the
power
under
the
statute
to
so
order...
that
may
not
be
enforced
against
the
proceeds
of
the
policy,
and
obviously
we
have
no
information
or
view
as
to
whether,
whether
there
are
other
assets
available
here,
but
we
think
it
is
not
a
small
point
that
a
distinction
be
drawn
between
enforcement
of
his
promise
as
opposed
to
imposition
of
a
constructive
trust
on
the
proceeds.
it
seems
to
us
that
one
of
the
things
that
is
essentially
different
about
this
military
service
policy
from
other
life
insurance
situations,
putting
aside
the
convenience
of
the
insurer
or
anything
such
as
that,
is
that
it
is
a
program
intended
for
mass
application
for
people
sometimes
serving
overseas.
it
is
intended
to
be
simple.
congress
designed
it
so
that
one
is
presumptively
enrolled
unless
one
opts
out.
in
the
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
you
find
references
to
things
such
as
the
fact
that
that
was
intended
to
cover
pows
in
vietnam.
it
was
all
intended
to
be
very
simple,
cut
and
dried
so
that
the
serviceman
might
know
that
when
he
signed
on
this
form
that
is
provided
by
the
military,
which
is
within...
a
copy
of
which
is
within
the
record,
that
he
could
rest
assured
that
that
beneficiary
would
receive
those
proceeds.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
maine
court,
in
supposing
that
by
getting
the
insurance
company
off
the
hook
as
they
purported
to
view,
took
a
very
restrictive
view
of
what
congress
intended.
we
would
suppose
that,
all
other
things
being
equal,
congress
would
be
more
content
to
have
prudential
litigating
this
than
to
have
donna
ridgway
or
people
in
her
position
faced
with
the
burden
of
litigating
this.
we
would
suppose
that
part
of
what
congress
meant
was
not
only
that
there
be
financial
security,
but
that
this
lawsuit
not
have
occurred,
and
yet
it
obviously
has,
and
therefore
we
share
the
view
that
a
clear
judgment
of
this
court
having
the
effect
that
this
insurance
policy
simply
could
not
be
an
asset,
could
not
be
a
chip
in
the
bargaining
in
a
separation
agreement
process
would
be
beneficial.
the
respondents
have
suggested
that
that
would
be
anomalous,
make
the
insurance
policy
worthless
and
so
on,
but
in
many
respects
that
would
place
this
insurance
on
a
similar
basis...
on
a
basis
similar
to
other
insurance.
other
insurance
may
be
cancelled
for
nonpayment
of
premiums,
it
may
be
cancelled
because
one
is
no
longer
eligible
for
health
reasons,
and
it
is,
i
think
most
divorce
lawyers
know,
a
very
risky
asset
to
take
in
a
separation
agreement,
and
contrary
to
what
respondents
suggested,
it
would
probably
be
beneficial
were
that
clear
to
all
counsel.
and
certainly
a
judgment
of
this
court
to
that
effect
would
do
so.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
address
is
that
there
really
can't
be
any
question
here
that
congress
was
aware
that
it
was
superseding
the
application
of
state
law
in
providing
the
right
to
designate
the
beneficiary
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
simply
ignore
the
existence
of
state
law.
in
the
table
of
order
of
precedence,
down
at
the
bottom,
when
you
get
to
no.
5
and
no.
6,
referring
to
the
executor
of
the
estate
or
next
of
kin
controlled
by
state
law,
those
effectively
incorporate
state
law.
so
congress,
aware
of
what
it
was
doing,
placed
state
law
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
list.
the
government's
interest
in
this
case
is
obviously
not
identical
with
sergeant
ridgway's,
and
we
don't
particularly
have
a
brief
for
the
facts
of
this
case.
our
brief
is
obviously
for
the
program,
and
we
suggest
that
in
general
it
would
be
best
if
the
sanctity
of
the
serviceman's
designation
were
upheld
in
all
respects,
and
that
if,
as
congress
may
deem
it
appropriate
to
devise
a
system
whereby
effect
may
be
given
to
a
state
judgment,
that
is
best
fashioned
by
congress.
in
this
regard,
it
might
be
worthwhile
to
point
out
that
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
briefs
in
this
case,
congress
has
adopted
legislation
which
alters
the
result
in
hisquierdo,
doesn't
overturn
the
court's
decision
nor
suggest
that
it
was
wrong.
it
creates
a
uniform
federal
solution
under
the
railroad
retirement
act
which
congress
deemed
equitable.
it
is
national
in
application.
it
does
not
turn
on
whether
it's
a
community
property
state
or
not.
obviously
this
is
something
the
court
could
not
do,
could
not
have
done
in
hisquierdo.
and
the
newspapers
also
tell
us
that
congress
is
considering
uniform
national
solutions
to
introduce
some
kind
of
equity
for
divorced
spouses
which
would
alter
the
result
in
mccarty
but
not
suggest
that
it
be
overruled
directly.
these
are
matters
which
congress
is
clearly
addressing
closely.
it
is
much
more
within
the
province
of
congress
to
make
the
kind
of
fine
adjustments
which
would
be
appropriate,
perhaps.
the
judgment
is
for
congress
in
certain
circumstances,
but
there
seems
to
no
need
to
subject
the
beneficiaries
of
a
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
policy
to
the
kind
of
constructive
trust
which
was
imposed
in
this
case.
the
court
in
its
recent
decisions
in
hisquierdo
and
mccarty
has
outlined
a
two
step
test
for
judging
matters
such
as
this
which
involve
the
question
of
preemption
of
state
law
relating
to
marital
property
when
it
is
applied
to
a
federal
benefit
program.
we
would
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
both
of
those
elements
are
satisfied
because
there
is
both
a
conflict
between
the
state
right
based
on
state
law
which
is
asserted,
and
a
clear
impairment
of
the
federal
purpose
sufficient
to
require
that
the
state
right
not
be
recognized.
the
purpose
of
the
program
as
we
understand
it
was
to
ensure
that
the
serviceman's
intent
be
enforced,
and
under
the
circumstances,
we
suggest
that
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
maine
court
is
appropriate.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
