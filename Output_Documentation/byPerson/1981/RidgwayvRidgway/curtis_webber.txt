mr.
curtis
webber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
to
begin
by
apologizing
for
the
numerous
typographical
errors
in
the
brief
which
i
discovered
when
i
was
preparing
for
this
argument.
rather
than
taking
the
court's
time
with
simply
detailing
some
of
those
which
may
be
confusing,
i
propose
to
submit
something
to
the
clerk
within
the
next
few
days
indicating
those
areas
where
there
may
be
some
confusion
because
of
the
typographical
mistakes
that
were
made.
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
serviceman
made
an
agreement
with
his
wife
prior
to
a
divorce,
a
fact
which
was
not
mentioned
by
mr.
beale
in
his
description
of
the
facts,
by
which
he
committed
himself
to
make
his
service
life
insurance
payable
to
his
children.
he
accepted
the
benefits
of
that
contract.
there
were
negotiations
between
the
parties
which
presumably
permitted
him
to
perhaps
make
lower
support
payments,
and
then
he
subsequently
refused
to
honor
it.
he
consented
to
the
entry
of
a
divorce
decree
which
made
his
obligation
to
make
these
insurance
proceeds
payable
to
his
children
part
of
the
court
order,
and
he
later
ignored
that.
i
think
that
on
these
facts...
well,
i
should
add
also
that
finally
his
second
wife,
petitioners
argue,
is
entitled
to
retain
the
proceeds
even
though
they
were
certainly
a
windfall
to
her
and
a
result
of
her
husband's
illegal
act
in
defiance
of
the
court
decree
and
his
own
agreement.
now,
on
these
facts,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
ask
what
overriding
policies
are
there
which
would
compel
this
court
to
reach
the
result
which
i
would
characterize
as
totally
absurd
and
unfair.
mr.
curtis
webber
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
really
believe
that
the
supremacy
clause
is
at
issue
here
because
i
don't
believe
there's
really
a
conflict
between
the
state
law
in
imposing
constructive
trust,
and
the
federal
statute.
mr.
curtis
webber
well,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
he
is
free
and
that
a
state
court
order
to
the
contrary
would
be
superseded
by
the
supremacy
clause.
it
is
conceivable,
however,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
carry
the
authorization
to
servicemen
that
far,
and
that
the
intention
was
solely
to
permit
changes
of
beneficiaries
where
this
would
not
be
in
contravention
of
state
law.
however,
the
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
is
still
subject
to
all
of
the
common
law
doctrines
which
have
clearly
over
the
years
made
it
clear
that
the
beneficiary
of
a...
of
insurance
policies
such
as
this
may
not
keep
the
proceeds
where
to
do
so
would
be
to
result
in
unjust
enrichment.
now,
several
of
the
justices
asked
the
attorney
for
prudential
a
question
which
has
been
puzzling
me,
which
is,
why
are
they
here?
the
administrative
inconvenience
argument
is
difficult
for
me
to
follow
since
the
maine
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
the
constructive
trust
theory
applies
only
to
the
proceeds
in
the
hands
of
the
beneficiary,
so
that
the
insurance
company
may
safely
pay
the
beneficiary
in
every
case
unless
they
are
subject
to
some
court
restraint
directing
them
not
to
do
so.
mr.
curtis
webber
that's
a
practical,
certainly
a
practical
reason
they're
here.
mr.
curtis
webber
as
several
justices
indicated
or
implied
in
their
questions,
in
any
case
where
an
insurance
company
in
the
position
of
prudential
has
been
faced
with
conflicting
demands
for
policy
proceeds
and
has
been
made
subject
to
a
court
order
not
to
pay,
it
can
simply
resolve
the
question
by
interpleading
the
parties.
this
is
certainly
a
nominal
expense
which
would
be
justified
by
the
object
of
preventing
fraud
and
unjust
enrichment
as
occurred
here.
now,
i
would
also
raise
a
question
as
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
these
proceedings.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
begins
with
a
section
entitled
interest
of
the
united
states,
and
in
that
portion
of
his
brief
he
indicates
that
the
purpose
of
the
servicemen's
life
insurance
program
is
in
part,
"designed
to
render
military
service
more
attractive.
"
and
also,
"to
maintain
morale
of
service
members.
"
now,
in
examining
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
we
must
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
as
the
court
said
in
hisquierdo,
local
law
dealing
with
family
law
problems
will
be
followed
by
this
court
unless
"there
is
major
damage
to
clear
and
substantial
federal
interest.
"
the
solicitor
general's
brief
does
not
explain
why
there
is
any
damage
to
federal
interest
as
a
result
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
and
what
objectives
will
be
frustrated
by
that
holding.
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
that
any
prospective
enlistee
in
the
military
services
would
be
dissuaded
from
doing
that
if
he
were
told
by
a
recruiter
that
we
offer
a
program
of
group
life
insurance
at
low
cost,
but
i
must
warn
you
that
if
you
intend
to
defraud
your
dependents
at
some
later
time,
under
the
holding
of
the
maine
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
so.
that
sounds
like
a
ridiculous
proposition,
but
it
certainly--
mr.
curtis
webber
--well,
i--
mr.
curtis
webber
--but
that
masks
the
concern
of
the
solicitor
general
which
is
only
in
the
case
dealt
with
here,
which
is
limited
to
those
circumstances
where
there
is
unjust
enrichment
coupled
with
a
fiduciary
relationship
or
fraud.
mr.
curtis
webber
well,
you
are
assuming
his
hypothetical
rather
than
mine,
where
the
recruiter--
mr.
curtis
webber
--i
assume
that
is
conceivable.
mr.
curtis
webber
that
was
during
the
vietnam
conflict.
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
was
a
draft...
yes,
there
was
a
draft
then.
mr.
curtis
webber
no,
but
that's
not
the
ground
offered
by
the
solicitor
general
as
supporting
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
as
an
inducement--
mr.
curtis
webber
--there's
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
service
life
insurance
program
as
it
is
outlined
by
congress
except
in
these
rare
cases
where
unjust
enrichment
and
fraud
would
result.
in
those
cases
it
would
be
stopped.
and
i
ask
what
interest
of
the
united
states
is
adversely
affected
by
that.
now,
i
have
research
the
legislative
history
insofar
as
it
is
available
to
us
in
maine,
and
i
can
find
nothing,
not
a
hint
that
congress
intended
to
carry
the
rights
of
designated
beneficiary
in
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
this
far,
to
this
extreme.
in
fact,
we
know
from
the
1974
amendments
to
the
social
security
act
that
congress
had
lost
patience
with
servicemen
who
were
refusing
to
support
their
families,
and
i
suggest
it
is
unlikely
that
they
would
have
been
in
favor
of
the
kind
of
result
which
petitioners
here
ask
this
court
to
reach.
perhaps
it's
a
point
so
obvious
that
it
doesn't
need
to
be
stated,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
result
which
petitioners
request
this
court
to
reach
also
encourages
servicemen
to
disregard
their
legal
and
moral
obligations,
in
this
case,
in
addition,
the
serviceman's
obligation
under
his
own
contract,
as
evidenced
by
the
separation
agreement
with
his
wife.
mr.
curtis
webber
the
estate
was
insolvent
as
far
as
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
webber
i...
well,
our
information
was
not
very
good.
mr.
ridgway
died
in
alabama,
and
that
was
some
distance
away,
and
communication
was
screened
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
another
marriage.
mr.
curtis
webber
no.
mr.
curtis
webber
i
have
been
in
it
since
the
time
of
the
divorce.
mr.
curtis
webber
that's
correct.
mr.
curtis
webber
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
we
would
say--
mr.
curtis
webber
--pardon?
mr.
curtis
webber
i
draw
the
line
at
the
same
place
that
this
court
drew
it
in
the
wissner
case,
between
those
obligations
which
arise
out
of
the
marital
or
parental
obligation,
which
are
not
commercial
transactions,
and
those
which
are
more
commercial
in
nature.
in
that
case
the
court,
of
course,
held
that
a
community
property
relationship
was
that
kind
of
a
quasi
commercial
relationship.
now,
justice
stevens
asked
a
question
earlier
which
is
connected
with
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
address,
that
is,
that
although
the
petitioners
have
emphasized
the
absolute
right
of
a
serviceman
to
change
the
beneficiary
under
his
policy
and
also
have
insisted
there
must
be
strict
compliance
with
that
designation,
the
fact
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
examples
which
i
assume
that
petitioners
would
acknowledged
in
which
equitable
principles
have
been
allowed
to
prevail
over
the
strict
language
of
a
statute
or
a
contract
in
which
a
particular
person
is
designated
as
the
beneficiary.
mr.
curtis
webber
yes.
let
me
give
you
some
examples.
what
if,
in
our
case,
donna
ridgway
had...
the
second
wife,
had
been
advised
by
richard
that
he
was
having
second
thoughts
and
decided
he
wanted
to
name
the
children
after
all
and
she
killed
him
to
prevent
that
from
happening,
hoping
to
get
away
with
it
but
it
was
found
out?
this
court...
excuse
me,
the
circuit
courts
have
held,
and
i
think
perhaps
this
court
has
held
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
that
when
a
person
who
murders
the
insured
is
not
entitled
to
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
on
equitable
principles,
and
in
the
sixth
circuit,
held
under
language
which
was
identical
to
that
in
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance,
this
being
language
dealing
with
federal
employees,
which
has
the
same
language
in
it
about
the
right
to
designate
beneficiaries,
that
the
murderer
could
not
receive
the
proceeds
of
the
policy.
now,
suppose
in
this
case
donna
had
been
told
by
richard
that
he
wanted
to
change
the
beneficiary
back
to
the
children
and
he
gave
her
a
form
to
send
to
new
jersey
which
would
have
accomplished
that,
but
she
surreptitiously
destroyed
it
and
did
not
do
what
he
wished.
this
is
a
case
where
unclean
hands
on
the
part
of
the
claimant,
donna,
would
bar
her
under
well
recognized
decisions
from
collecting
the
insurance
proceeds.
and
again,
this
is
an
example
of
a
situation
where
equitable
principles
were
allowed
to
prevail
over
language
of
the
statute.
and
we
cited
cases
in
our
brief
in
which
this
was
done.
these
are
cases,
again,
involving
the
federal
employees
life
insurance
program.
now,
suppose
in
our
case
that
donna
had
agreed
with
richard,
again
supposing
he
had
second
thoughts
about
changing
the
beneficiary
designation,
that
she
would
hold
the
proceeds
for
the
benefit
of
his
children
and
would
make
sure
that
they
received
them,
and
he
died
subsequently,
believing
that
that
would
be
the
case.
we
cited
two
cases
in
which
exactly
this
was
done
and
a
constructive
trust
was
imposed
and
the
language
of
the
statute
involved
was
identical
with
that
presented
in
the
case
of
bonner.
mr.
curtis
webber
but,
your
honor,
the
point
of
the
example
is
not
that
there
is
interference
with
carrying
out
the
will
of
the
insured,
but
the
fact
that
despite
petitioners'
contention
that
absolute
compliance
with
the
beneficiary
designations
must
be
insisted
upon
in
all
cases,
that
in
fact
there
are
numerous
situations
where
courts
have
invoked
equitable
principles
not
to
comply
exactly
with
those
policy
designations.
mr.
curtis
webber
yes.
mr.
curtis
webber
all
right.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
two
cases
in
particular
that
involved
united
states
savings
bonds.
one
is
free
v.
bland,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1964,
and
the
second
is
yiatchos--
mr.
curtis
webber
--yes,
it
is,
justice
marshall.
mr.
curtis
webber
free
v.
bland
is
cited
on
several
pages
in
our
brief.
the
yiatchos
case
is
cited
also
at
three
different
pages
in--
mr.
curtis
webber
--well--
mr.
curtis
webber
--yiatchos
is
cited
on
pages
3,
16
and
17.
mr.
curtis
webber
and
free
is
cited
on
3,
16,
17,
and
18.
the
case
of
free
v.
bland,
decided
in
196--
mr.
curtis
webber
--hisquierdo
distinguished,
distinguished
those
two
cases.
mr.
curtis
webber
in
free
v.
bland,
mr.
free
bought
a
savings
bond
in
the
name
of
himself
and
his
wife.
mrs.
free
died,
and
her
heirs
contested
the
fact
that
mr.
free
was
to
take,
as
a
survivor,
take
the
full
amount
of
the
bond.
this
court
held
that
the
community
property
principle
would
have
to
be
subordinated
to
the
treasury
regulation
specifying
that
the
survivor
take
the
whole
thing,
but
it
pointed
out
and
noted
a
concession
by
the
solicitor
general
who
appeared
as
an
amicus
in
that
case
that
federal
bonds
would
not
be
"a
sanctuary
for
a
wrongdoer's
gains.
"
the
yiatchos
case
followed
this,
the
case
of
free
v.
bland
two
years
later.
in
that
case,
mr.
yiatchos
bought
a
savings
bond,
but
this
time
not
in
the
name
of
himself
and
his
wife.
he
used
community
property,
and
this
was
a
community
property
state.
the
bonds
were
purchased
in
his
own
name
and
the
name
of
his
brother.
upon
mr.
yiatchos'
death,
there
was
a
contest
between
his
heirs
and
his
brother.
mr.
curtis
webber
no,
this
case
did
not
turn--
mr.
curtis
webber
--yes,
yes,
it
is
their
position.
i'd
like
to
quote
the
treasury
regulations
just
very
briefly
which
were
in
effect
covering
the
bonds
in
that
case.
they
stated
that
when
either
co
owner
dies,
"the
survivor
will
be
recognized
as
the
sole
and
absolute
owner.
"
and
also,
"no
judicial
determination
will
be
recognized
which
would
defeat
or
impair
the
rights
of
survivorship
conferred
by
these
regulations.
"
and
i
would
suggest
that
these
are
as
definitive
and
positive
expressions
of
federal
intent
as
can
be
found
in
the
cases
brought
under
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance.
yet
despite
those
regulations,
this
court
held
in
yiatchos
that
because
it
was
found
by
the
court
below
that
there
had
been
a
constructive
fraud
on
the
part
of
mr.
yiatchos
in
using
community
property
in
light
of
his
fiduciary
relationship
as
a
manager
of
that
property,
to
the
disadvantage
of
his
wife,
that
it
would
not
permit
the
federal
rules
regarding
the
disposition
of
property
to
become
an
instrument
of
fraud.
mr.
curtis
webber
that's
correct.
mr.
curtis
webber
but
there's
a
difference
in
the
fact
that
maine
is
not
a
community
property
state,
but
a
difference
which
is
not
applicable
to
the
principle
which
i
am
pressing
upon
the
court
at
this
point,
which
is
that
this
court
overrode
the
clear
language
of
the
treasury
regulations
dealing
with
the
disposition
of
the
savings
bonds
when
it
found
that
to
do
so
would
be
to
permit
a
fraud.
mr.
curtis
webber
is
that
a
question?
mr.
curtis
webber
essentially.
the
case
indicated
that
the...
i
don't
recall.
i
think
it
might
have
been...
well,
i
don't
recall
the
name
of
the
state,
but
the
state
court
held...
i
think
it
was
washington.
mr.
curtis
webber
that
the
husband
is,
under
community
property
law,
the
manager
of
the
community
property
has
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
the
spouse
in
that
situation,
and
it
was
a
breach
of
this
fiduciary
relationship
which
defrauded
her
of
her
interest
in
the
community
property
which
caused
this
court
to
say
we'll
not
permit
the
treasury
regulations
to
be
used
as
an
instrument
of
fraud
in
this
instance.
in
hisquierdo,
this
court
characterized
those
two
cases,
distinguished
those
two
cases,
and
wissner,
as
being...
excuse
me,
it
distinguished
that
case
from
wissner,
those
two,
as
being
ones...
one
in
which
survivorship
rules
in
federal
insurance
will
prevail
unless
"fraud
or
breach
of
trust
occurs.
"
so
in
hisquierdo,
this
court
recognized
that
thread
of
distinction
that
was
running
in
those
other
three
cases.
now,
i'd
like
to
speak
for
a
moment
about
something
that
mr.
schwartz
commented
on
in
the
close
of
his
argument,
that
is,
the
practical
consequences
of
the
result
which
petitioners
seek
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
that
if
the
decision
of
the
maine
supreme
court
were
overruled
that
insurance
policies
under
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
will
continue
to
be
a
trap
for
unwary
persons
and
lawyers
such
as
myself
who
aren't
aware
of
the
pitfalls
and
difficulties
of
transferring
federal
insurance,
and
with
all
due
respect
to
this
court,
i
don't
believe
that
even
a
decision
of
this
court
would
necessarily
be
calculated
to
get
the
word
out
to
all
persons
who
are
practicing
divorce
law
of
the
dangers
of
dealing
with
federal
life
insurance.
i
don't
know
how
it
is
in
other
jurisdictions,
but
in
maine
i
know
that
there...
a
very
small
minority
of
the
practitioners
read
law
week
and
keep
abreast
of
events,
especially
in
such
esoteric
fields
of
the
law
as
this.
mr.
curtis
webber
that's
true,
but
wissner
really
is
not
dispositive
of
this
case.
mr.
curtis
webber
but
in
that
case
the
court
did
distinguish
the
situation
which
would
arise
in
a
non...
where
the
obligation
of
the
husband
arose
out
of
a
marital
obligation,
and
also,
there
was
no...
as
justice
stevens
mentioned
earlier,
there
was
no
separation
agreement,
there
was
no
fraud
on
the
spouse
in
that
situation.
so
it
really
was
quite
different
than
the
case
of
bonner.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
should
take
account
of
the
fact
that
ironically,
if
the
result
that
the
petitioners
seek
is
allowed,
that
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
policies
will
become
assets
that
no
one
will
know
what
to
do
with,
assuming,
for
a
moment,
that
lawyers
practicing
divorce
around
the
country
do
become
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
are
problems
in
committing
servicemen
irrevocably
to
keep
the
beneficiaries
as
they
agree
to
keep
them
in
a
divorce
decree.
mr.
curtis
webber
all
right,
assume
it...
let's
assume
now
that
the
word
does
get
around,
as
you
suggest.
assume
that
there's
a
situation
in
which
husband
and
wife
and
their
attorneys
are
negotiating
a
settlement
and
a
division
of
marital
property,
and
one
of
the
assets
that
is
to
be
decided
upon
is
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
policy.
let's
assume
he
doesn't
have
any
other
life
insurance.
he
obligates
himself
to
support
the
children,
to
provide
for
their
medical
care,
perhaps,
clothing
allowance...
these
are
all
things
that
were
part
of
the
agreement
in
this
case...
and
then
the
parties
say,
well,
what
will
we
do
in
case
you
die?
what
will
replace
the
money
that
you
are
now
contributing
to
the
children
in
these
various
ways?
obviously
you
look
to
the
life
insurance.
well,
we
can't
look
to
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance.
if
you
assume
a
knowledgeable
attorney,
he'll
advise
the
wife,
no,
you
can't
accept
those.
we'll
have
to
insist
before
we
can
reach
an
agreement
that
the
serviceman
go
out
and
buy
private
insurance
so
that
you
can
be
adequately
protected.
mr.
curtis
webber
i
suppose
it
might
be,
but
suppose
the
serviceman
really
can't
afford
to
buy
another,
a
second
insurance
policy,
or
suppose
he
has
a
medical
condition.
the
parties
are
left
in
an
impossible
situation.
this
would
be
particularly
frustrating
to
a
serviceman
who
knew
in
good
faith
he
wasn't
going
to
cheat
his
dependents
as
sergeant
ridgway
did,
and
in
good
faith
wanted
to
make
the
proceeds
of
his
insurance
policy
available
to
them,
and
he
is
being
told
by
his
wife
and
her
attorney,
we
can't
let
you
do
it
because
we
can't
trust
you.
the
constructive
trust
doctrine
won't
apply,
no
court
order
will
apply,
and
there's
nothing
we
can
do
to
hold
you
to
your
agreement.
mr.
curtis
webber
to
change
the
beneficiary?
mr.
curtis
webber
yes.
you
have
to
file
a
form
in
which
you
indicate--
mr.
curtis
webber
--i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
curtis
webber
well,
i
can't
say
that
my
experience
with
private
policies
is
large
enough
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question
intelligently,
justice
blackmun,
but
i'm
certainly
not
aware
of
any
way
that
if
the
maine
court
is
reversed,
a
serviceman's
obligation
expressed
in
a
separation
agreement
and
a
divorce
decree
to
keep
the
policy
in
force
for
the
dependents
can
be
enforced,
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
result,
if
it
were
to
take
place,
would
be
totally
at
odds
with
the
express
purpose
of
congress
in
the
legislative
history
to
make
insurance
of
this
sort
available
to
protect
the
dependents
of
the
servicemen
in
question.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
i
could
find
no
hint
in
the
legislative
history
of
any
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
express
the
beneficiary
the
right
of
the...
to
protect,
i
should
say,
the
right
of
the
serviceman
to
change
his
beneficiary,
even,
even
when
it
resulted
in
fraud
and
unjust
enrichment.
but
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
intend
these
insurance
proceeds
to
be
available
to
protect
the
dependents
of
the
serviceman,
and
this
is
a
result
which
i
would
suggest
would
be
frustrated
if
the
maine
supreme
court's
decision
is
overruled.
