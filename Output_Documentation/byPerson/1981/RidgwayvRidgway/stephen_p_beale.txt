mr.
stephen
p.
beale
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
attempted
a
number
of
times
to
state
the
facts
in
this
case
as
a
pure
proposition
of
law
in
a
single
sentence,
and
i
find
that
whenever
i
do
it
the
sentence
necessarily
has
six
or
seven
commas
and
an
equal
number
of
semi
colons,
so
i
will
attempt
to
do
it
by
a
brief
reference
to
the
facts
and
then
develop
the
facts
in
more
detail,
followed
by
the
argument.
at
base,
the
question
in
this
case
is
who
to
have
the
beneficial
enjoyment
of
the
proceeds
of
a
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
policy.
the
two
claimants
are,
first,
the
beneficiary
designated
under
the
procedures
provided
for
by
the
federal
statute
and
regulations,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
serviceman's
ex
wife
who
claims
the
policy
proceeds
for
the
benefit
of
her
minor
children
under
a
state
court
divorce
decree.
the
facts
are
these:
richard
ridgway
was
a
career
sergeant
in
the
army
ensured
under
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
program,
which
i
will
refer
to
hereafter
a
the
sgli
insurance
program,
in
the
amount
of
$20,000.
he
was
married
to
april
ridgway.
they
had
three
children,
all
of
whom
were
minors
at
the
time
sergeant
ridgway
died.
the
marriage
deteriorated.
april
and
richard
ridgway
were
divorced
in
1977,
and
in
the
divorce
decree
sergeant
ridgway
was
ordered
to
maintain
in
effect
for
the
benefit
of
his
minor
children
his
life
insurance
policies.
the
only
life
insurance
policy
he
had
at
that
time
was
his
<sgli>
[=
sgli]
policy.
he
did
not
do
that,
however.
he
subsequently
married
donna
ridgway,
the
co-petitioner
in
this
action.
shortly
thereafter
he
changed
the
beneficiary
designation
in
the
manner
provided
for
on
the
military
form
which
embodied
an
order
of
precedent
set
forth
in
the
applicable
statute
and
regulations
of
38
u.s.c.
770(g)--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--770(a)
rather.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor,
neither
was
it
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
uniformed
services,
which
would
have
been
possibly
a
place
to
which
it
might
have
been
directed,
although
the
statute
and
regulations
specifically
provide
that
it
is
only
a
specific
form
of
writing
signed
by
the
serviceman
which
is
effective
to
create
or
to
change
a
beneficiary
designation.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
that
is
correct.
under
a
prior
form
of
insurance,
the
former
national
service
life
insurance
program,
such
a
document
might
possibly
have
been
effective.
however,
in
enacting
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
under
the
servicemen's
group
life,
the
sgli
program,
the
manner
in
which
beneficiaries
can
be
created
and
changed
is
very
specifically
set
forth
by
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
and
that
requires
that
the
beneficiary
designation
be
in
writing,
signed
by
the
serviceman
and
received
by
the
appropriate
military
unit
before
the
insured's
death.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
that
is
correct.
he
has
the
unalterable
right,
the
unlimited
right
to
change
the
designation
at
any
time,
not
to
inform
the
prior
beneficiary,
and
he
may
change
it
as
many
times
as
he
wishes.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
yes,
they
are.
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--pardon?
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
it
is...
i
do
not
know
the
exact
details
of
his
probate
estate,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
was
minimal
if
at
all,
if
he
left
an
estate
at
all.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
it
would
be
our
position,
your
honor,
that...
it's
an
open
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
an
action
permissible
against
the
estate
for
breach
of
contract,
but
if
that
were
deemed
to
be
appropriate,
i
cannot
provide
you
with
a
definitive
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
full
recovery
of
the
amount
of
the
policy
proceeds
or
not.
it's
my
understanding
that
there
would
not
be,
but
i
cannot
absolutely
say
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
we
do
not
wish
to
be
hard
hearted
about
it,
but
it
would
be
the
primary
concern
of
the
other
side
if
they
wished
to
pursue
that
potential
remedy.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
i
am
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
your
honor.
it
is
mr.
webber's...
the
serviceman
is
not
represented
by
any
party
here,
per
se,
but
the
party
who
might
have
voluntarily
agreed
you're
suggesting
would
have
been
sergeant
ridgway.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
he
is
not
represented
per
se
in
this
action.
the
claimants
are
here,
his
ex
wife
on
behalf
of
the
minor
children,
the
designated
beneficiary,
who
was
his
widow
at
the
time
of
his
death,
and
the
insurance
carrier,
and
i
am
counsel
for
the
insurance
carrier,
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
co-petitioner,
the
designated
beneficiary
and
the
carrier.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
if
i
could
continue
with
the
facts--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--that
is
correct.
but
i'm
arguing
on
behalf
of
prudential
and
the
designated
beneficiary.
the...
as
the...
after
this
divorce
and
the
subsequent
remarriage
and
the
designation
of
the
second
wife,
sergeant
ridgway...
and
he
executed
this
beneficiary
designation
in
the
manner
provided
for
under
the
statute
and
regulations
which
provided
that
the
benefits
be
paid
by
law,
which
under
the
order
of
precedence
had
the
effect
of
paying
his
widow,
if
he
had
one
when
he
died.
donna
ridgway
did
continue
to
be
married
to
sergeant
ridgway
when
he
died
several
months
later.
she
thereupon
filed
a
proper
claim
for
the
benefits
in
the
appropriate
form.
another
claim
was
filed
by
april
ridgway
on
behalf
of
the
minor
children
under
the
divorce
decree.
prudential
stated
its
affirmative
intention
to
pay
the
designated
beneficiary,
donna,
the
second
wife.
april
thereupon
sued
prudential
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
proceeds
and
seeking
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
prudential
from
paying
donna.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
because...
prudential
has
taken
an
affirmative
position
in
wanting
to
pay
the
designated
beneficiary
not
because
of
the
first
wife
second
wife
issue,
but
because
of
the
administrative
uncertainty
and
terrible
additional
administrative
burdens
which
will
be
occasioned
if
the
result
which
april
seeks
were
to
come
about.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
well,
i
think
that
what
is
going
to
happen
is
that
at
a
minimum
it
will
involve
the
insurance
carrier
in
a
very
substantial
number
of
cases
in
which
it,
even
if
has
to
just
interplead
and
pay
the
proceeds
into
court
and
attempt
to
get
out
of
this,
sir,
is
going
to
involve
a
substantial
expense
of
time
and
energy
and
legal
expense
in
doing
that.
further,
there
is
a
substantial
chance
that
the
claim
for
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--your
honor,
there
are
additional
points.
if,
for
example--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--no.
to
respond
to
an
additional
point,
justice
blackmun,
it
may
well
be
that
in
many
situations
the
carrier
would
pay
the
first
claimant
without
being
aware
that
there
was
a
prior
divorce
decree
outstanding,
and
one
of
the
additional
concerns
is
that
the
insurance
company
will
certainly
be
sued
in
almost
any
event,
whether
before
or
after
it
pays
the
proceeds.
if
it's...
the
first
rule
of
plaintiff's
counsel
is
usually
to
sue
everybody
in
sight,
and
secondly--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--no,
i
think
not,
but
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
think...
well,
we
might
have.
i
will--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--the
theory
of
the
court
below
is
not
clear
on
that
point,
your
honor.
it
might
possibly
be--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--that
we
would
get
sued
again
by
the
party
who
ultimately
ended
up
being
the
correctly
designated
beneficiary
and
prior
claimant.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
well,
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i'm
not
saying
that
they
would
prevail
in
the
action,
your
honor,
but
i'm
saying--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--they
might
initiate
the
action,
and
just
the
additional
time
and
energy
and
expense
that
is
consumed
in
trying
to
get
out
adds
a
burden.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
yes,
it's
completely
different
because
here
we're
involved
with
a
federal
statute
which
not
only
provides
affirmatively
in
order
of
precedence
for
beneficiary
payment,
but
also
contains
a
provision
against
attachment
or--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
think--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
think
that
there
is
that
and
there
is
more.
the
additional
factor
that
is
involved
here
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
military
benefit.
it
is
a
particularly
unique
form
of
benefit
which
is
made
available
to
servicemen,
and
that
there
are,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
wissner
decision
which
was
reached
some
30
years
ago,
congress
has
set
up
a
program
of
military
benefits,
a
part
of
which
was
that
military
life
insurance
would
be
an
attractive
inducement
to
service.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
yes.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
i
think
that
that
is
true,
but
except
that
it
would
be
magnified
in
degree
if
not
in
technical
definition
by
virtue
of
the
enormous
number
of
these
policies
outstanding,
the
volatility
of
military
existence,
etcetera.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
this
is
one
of
the
most
enormous
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
and
it...
well,
it
has
an
additional
stake,
your
honor.
as
any
other
party,
if
you
are
associated
with
a
program,
you
like
it
to
work
well.
prudential--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--$20,000
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
no,
no,
nothing
whatsoever,
but
there
are
interests
broader
than
that.
no
one
likes
to
be
associated
with
a
program
which
is
going
to
constantly
be
subject
to
litigation,
to
challenges
to
the
reliability
of
the
beneficiary
designation,
to
the
retention
of
the
proceeds
in
the
hands
of
the
designated
beneficiary--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--that
is
an
interesting
question.
the
military...
the
congress
has
determined
that
this
is
a
benefit
that
would
be
offered
to
the
military.
in
setting
up
this
particular
form
of
military
insurance,
in
contrast
to
prior
forms,
justice
rehnquist,
the
government
is
not
the
insurer.
the
legislation
specifically
provided
that
a
contract
would
be
entered
into
between
the
veterans
administrator
and
a
private
contract
carrier
to
provide
the
coverage,
and
that
is
prudential's
role.
it
reinsures
a
great
deal
of
this
insurance
with
other
parties,
but
it
is
standing
in
lieu
of
the
government
for
purposes
of
this
particular
insurance
program.
so
therefore,
any
ill
effects
of
it
reflect
poorly
on
the
carrier,
poorly
on
the
military,
and
may
ultimately
weaken
the
attractiveness
of
the
life
insurance
as
an
inducement
to
military
service.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
well--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--no,
i
think
it
is...
the
right,
your
honor?
no,
that
the
right
is
created
by
the
federal
statute.
the
right
in
the
designated
beneficiary
to...
in
the
serviceman
first
to
designate
his
beneficiary
absolutely
is
provided
by
statute.
the
right--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
cannot
say,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
oh,
i
think
not.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
no,
we--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--no.
as
i
have
expressed
previously,
there
are
other
purposes
in
addition
to
those
that
are
directed
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
prudential
as
an
insurance
carrier.
there
are
the
aspects
of
the
attractiveness
of
the
benefit
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
military,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
united
states.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
no,
the
united
states
is
represented
by
a
representative
from
the
solicitor
general's
office,
but--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--there
is
an
interconnection
on--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
do
not
speak
for
the
united
states,
your
honor.
there
is
an
office
which
has
been
established--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--prudential
could
potentially
have
removed
itself
from
the
action
by
interpleading,
yes.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
yes.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
yes,
it
could
have,
but
it
chose
not
to
do
so
believing
that
it
was
in
the
better
interests
of
the
legislation
and
of
the
purpose
and
the
entire
program--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
think
it
felt,
as
i
indicated
previously,
that
any
time
you
are
associated
with
a
program,
if
it
doesn't
work
well,
then
that
reflects
poorly
on
you,
so
there
is
some
self
interest
there
as
well,
admittedly.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
well,
that
is
true,
but
in
attempting
to
protect
our
self
interest
we
are
defining
here,
or
attempting
to
urge
the
court
to
recognize
a
clearly
established,
federally
created
right
which
stands
in
substantial
opposition
to
a
state
interest,
and
attempting
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
that
federally
created
right,
and
we
stand,
argue
for
this
position
because
of
this
contractual
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
private
insurance
carrier
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
i
think
so,
your
honor,
yes,
and
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--that
would
be
the
position
we
would
take,
your
honor,
yes,
and
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action
over,
it's
against
the
party
who
caused
the
wrong
in
a
separate
action,
or
against
the
action
of
that
party's
estate
as
might
have
been
the
case
here.
their
case
was
tried
on
stipulated
facts.
the
superior
court
ruled
that
it...
that
the
supremacy
clause
did
control
the
situation,
that
it
could
not
make
any
award
or
order
in
favor
of
the
minor
children,
that
it
was
precluded
from
doing
so
by
the
federal
statute
and
regulations.
the
maine
supreme
court
interestingly,
in
reversing,
held
that
there
was
no
supremacy
clause
at
issue
here
because
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
stated
federal
purpose
in
enacting
the
military
insurance
program
and
the
competing...
and
the
state
interest
in
enhancing
its
state
court
divorce
decrees.
we
find
this
inconceivable
as
a
proposition
of
law.
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
when
the
money
goes
to
one
party
under
one
program
and
would
go
to
another
under
the
state
court's
award,
that
that's
clearly
a
conflict.
we
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
unique
military
character
of
this
benefit.
the...
we
think
that
the
maine
court
was
clearly
wrong,
and
that
this
court
in
its
mccarty
decision,
in
attempting
to
focus
on
a
federal
enactment
which
clearly
set
forth
a
federal
order
of
precedence
to
which
a
state
interest
in
the
family
law
area
did
a
substantial
and
meaningful
harm
has
made
it
clear
that
in
referring
to
the
military
beneficiary
designation
provisions
at
issue
in
wissner,
that
that
was
a
model
for
both
the
court's
opinion
and
the
dissent
on
the
federal
statute
in
which
the
federal
interest
is
enunciated
with
force
and
clarity
to
which
the
competing
state
interest
did
substantial
harm,
and
it
was
resolved
in
favor
of
a
determination
of
preemption.
that
preemption
issue
was
determined
in
favor
of
the
federal
interest
by
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
wissner
was
technically
a
community
property
case,
your
honor,
and
not
one
involving
issues
directly.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
it
was
nsli,
but
the
beneficiary
designation
provisions
and
the
spendthrift
provisions,
the
anti
attachment
provisions
of
the
two
statutes
are
virtually
identical.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
i
think
it
is
possibly,
your
honor,
by...
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
community
property
interest
and
another
interest
at
issue
here,
but
i
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
same
rationale
that
is
embodied
in
wissner,
hisquierdo
and
mccarty.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
that
is
true,
but
he
subsequently
made
another,
perfectly
valid
beneficiary
designation.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
but
there
is
a
difference
in
the
two
cases.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
that
is
right,
and
wissner
is
not
a
divorce
situation
either.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
in
brief
response
to
several
points
raised
by
mr.
webber,
first,
as
to
the
unjust
enrichment
item,
the
argument
which
mr.
webber
advances
lose
sight...
loses
sight
of
one
very
fundamental,
important
point,
which
is
that
donna,
the
second
wife
and
designated
beneficiary,
is
simply
not
unjustly
enriched
here
in
that
she
has
done
nothing
wrong.
she
has
committed
no
improper
act
herself.
she
was
sergeant
ridgway's
legitimate
wife.
she
remained
his
wife
at
the
time
of
his
death.
she--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
think
it
probably
would
have
been.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
on
these
particular
facts,
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
i
understand
your
question
now.
yes,
they
did
in
effect,
and
they
not
only
declared
that
the
remedy
of
a
constructive
trust
would
potentially
be
available,
which
the
superior
court
had
decided
was
not
even
available
for
it
to
consider
because
of
the
supremacy
clause
issue,
the
maine
court
went
beyond
that
and
sua
sponte
imposed
the
constructive
trust
on
the
proceeds
without
even
remanding
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
true.
but
the
central
point
is
that
i
think
that
in
contradistinction
to
what
the
maine
court
held,
that
donna
ridgway
was
not
unjustly
enriched,
in
short,
that
holding
is
wrong.
as
to
the
supremacy
clause--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--i
think
in
that
case,
then,
again,
under
this
particular
program,
the
proceeds
ought
to
be
paid
absolutely
to
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--designated
beneficiary,
and
it
is
then
incumbent
upon
the
party
whose
interest
has
been
damaged
to
proceed
accordingly.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
to
the
supremacy
clause
question,
that
the
real
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
supremacy
clause
applies
or
not,
and
whether
there's
a
preemption
issue,
but
how
far
the
preemption
extends.
the
respondents'
argument
would
have
the
court
hold
that
the
preemption
argument
extends
only
to
the
mechanical
payment
of
the
proceeds
to
the
designated
beneficiary,
and
that
the
federal
preemption
then
stops
and
a
constructive
trust
may
be
imposed
on
the
proceeds
in
the
hands
of
the
designated
beneficiary.
well,
that's
a
hollow
argument.
it's
clear
that
the
intent
here
has
to
be
that
the
federal
preemption
must
extend
to
the
beneficial
enjoyment
of
the
proceeds.
that
point
is
made
in
the
hisquierdo
decision,
it's
made
again
in
the
mccarty
decision,
that
what
is
really
at
issue
is
where
the
beneficial
enjoyment
of
the
proceeds
ends
up
and
not
the
mere
mechanical
payment.
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
well,
this
gets
us
back--
mr.
stephen
p.
beale
--that
is
nominally
correct,
your
honor,
but
for
the
reasons
we've
discussed
previously,
we
feel
that
it
is
to
the
greater
benefit
of
the
entire
program
because
of
the
unique
position
that
the
insurance
carrier
holds
in
lieu
of
the
government
to
ensure
that
that
result
does
not
obtain
and
that
the
proceeds
are
paid
absolutely
without
restriction.
