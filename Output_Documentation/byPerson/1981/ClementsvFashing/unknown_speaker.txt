unknown
speaker
was
that
called
to
the
attention
of
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
even
after
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
municipal
judges
who
still
have
two-year
terms
are
still
subject
to
the
resign
to
run
rule?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
they
aren't.
they
are
not
subject
to
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
does
that
necessarily
destroy
the
holding
below?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
depend
on
whether
the
difference
is
relevant.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
but
what
the
state
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction
or
the
district
court
is
subject
to
article
iii,
section
19?
unknown
speaker
article
iii,
section
19.
unknown
speaker
may
i
get
back
to
just
a
moment
to
what
you
tell
us
was
the
error
of
the
district
court?
what
can
we
do
about
that?
can
we
correct
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
said
this
was
relied
on
very
heavily.
unknown
speaker
to
support
the
finding
of
unconstitutionality.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
a
matter
of
texas
law,
i
guess,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
we
don't
second
guess
holdings
of
district
judges
or
courts
of
appeals--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
what
state
law
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
we
have
to
read
the
section
that
you
said
he
misconstrued,
and
we
would
have
to
do
what?
construe
it
ourselves?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
highest
texas
court
that
would
take
care
of
a
question
like
this?
the
supreme
court?
is
it
the
texas
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
is
an
error
of
law
or
an
error
of
fact
by
the
district
judge,
by
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
but
the
real
error
was
in
not
giving
the
judge
a
chance
to
straighten
it
out.
right?
unknown
speaker
he
wasn't
given
the
opportunity.
you
didn't
call
it
to
his
attention.
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
didn't,
but
i
mean
your
office
was
responsible
for
it.
unknown
speaker
and
it
could
have
been
straightened
out
then,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say
the
judge
overlooked
the
recent
statute?
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
newly
enacted,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
his
opinion
did
not
mention
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
are
saying
is,
he
simply,
so
far
as
the
face
of
his
opinion
goes,
did
not
consider
an
article
and
section
of
the
texas
constitution.
unknown
speaker
so
he
didn't
construe
it,
he
just
apparently
didn't
cite
it
at
all.
unknown
speaker
or
consider
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
any
comparison
or
analogy
between
the
resign
to
run
provision
and
the
provision
of
article
i,
section
6,
of
the
united
states
constitution,
that
says
no
senator
or
representative
shall
during
the
time
for
which
he
was
elected
be
appointed
to
any
civil
office
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
which
shall
have
been
created
or
the
emoluments
thereof
have
been
increased
during
such
time?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
exemption
of
state
legislators
from
the
rule
was
the
result
of
compromise?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
have
to
find
that
this
is
the
result
of
a
compromise,
or
this
is
the
deliberate
choice
of
the
state
legislature
for
reasons
which
they
haven't
explained,
and
perhaps
don't
need
to
explain?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
system
of
preserving
the
legislative
history,
the
evolution
of
a
statute
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
these
were
amendments
proposed
by
the
legislature,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
each
of
these
plaintiffs
falls
within
one
of
the
categories
to
whom
section
19
applies?
i
mean,
he
is
either
a
judge
or
one
of
the
other
offices,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
each
of
them
would.
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
them
has
suggested
he
wanted
to
run
for
the
legislature
except
the
one
who
said
maybe
he
might.
unknown
speaker
general
allison,
you
say
this
is
an
equalizer,
but
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
the
classifications
here
are
not
classifications
of
persons,
but
rather
classification
of
offices.
do
i
understand
that
argument
to
mean
that
you
don't
understand
there
to
be
a
constitutional
duty
to
treat
all
offices
alike,
and
if
so,
you
don't
even
need
the
equalizer
if
that
argument
is
right?
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
if
i
understood
your
argument
about
the
difference
between
offices,
not
persons,
you
don't
even
need
a
rational
basis,
because
the
persons
just
happen
to
occupy
different
offices,
and
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
different
state
offices
have
the
same
emoluments.
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
a
county
judge
be
paid
the
same
as
a
circuit
judge,
for
example.
is
that
what
you
are
arguing?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
constitutional
requirement
that
different
offices
have
the
same
emoluments,
burdens
or
benefits?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
don't
even
need
a
rational
basis.
unknown
speaker
why?
why
couldn't
you
say,
you
need
a
college
education
to
be
a
circuit
judge,
and
you
need
a
high
school
education
to
be
a
county
judge?
what
is
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
is
not
rational.
even
if
the
one
has
greater
responsibility
than
the
other.
what
is
the
constitutional
objection?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
saying,
even
if
the
more
difficult
job
you
merely
required
a
high
school
education
for,
i
don't
know
why
the
constitution
would
prevent
the
texas
legislature
from
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
took
it
that
you
were
attempting
to
respond
to
the
rationale
of
the
fifth
circuit
on
this.
was
that
the
point
you
were
trying
to
make?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allison,
if
one
subject
to
the
resign
to
run
rule...
those
are
four-year
term
people?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
want
to
run
for
an
office
for
the
term
beginning
when
yours
expires,
you
are
going
to
have
to
start
running
while
you
are
in
office.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
have
to
resign
under
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't?
unknown
speaker
you
can
run
for
a
term
that
starts
at
the
expiration
of
your
own?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
it
is
for
re-election
of
your
present
office
or
a
new
one?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allison,
in
your
brief
you
advanced
a
number
of
arguments
justifying
the
various
classifications
in
section
65,
but
in
the
answers
to
your
interrogatories
at
the
trial
level,
or
the
interrogatories
that
were
propounded,
it
sounded
like
at
best
section
65
was
just
the
product
of
maybe
some
sloppy
legislative
drafting,
and
that
these
arguments
are
rather
an
afterthought.
is
that
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
point
that
if
the
municipal
judges
had
only
two-year
terms,
and
the
justices
of
the
peace
four
years,
that
it
is--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
he
has
less
than
a
year
to
go.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
are
you
arguing
that
the
burden
is
so
severe
that
it
is
unconstitutional
even
if
it
applied
to
everybody?
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably
when
they
ran
for
the
original
office,
they
took
it
subject
to
the
burdens
that
the
statute
imposed.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
there
is
no
equal
protection
problem.
what
else
would
there
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happens
with
states
that
say
you
can
only
serve
one
term?
unknown
speaker
there
certainly
are.
that
is
right.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
little
more
stringent
than
this
one?
unknown
speaker
under
this
one,
you
can
serve
26
terms,
provided
you
abide
by
the
law.
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
one,
you
can't
serve
but
one
anyway.
unknown
speaker
when
you
talk
about
restrictions,
i
think
you
had
better
get
another
word,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
run
knowing
that
you
can't
campaign
for
the
other
one.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
why
is
one
so
bad
and
the
other
one
is
not?
unknown
speaker
where
does
that
policy
derive?
unknown
speaker
plus,
i
don't
think
any
of
us
ran
for
this
office.
unknown
speaker
i
hope
we
didn't.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
be
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
say
that
no
federal
judge
may
run
for
the
united
states
senate
without
first
resigning?
unknown
speaker
without
first
resigning
his
judicial
office.
unknown
speaker
how
is
this
different?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
equal
protection
claim?
what
is
the
most
glaring
example
of
unfair
treatment?
there
are
so
many
offices
involved,
it
is
hard
to...
and
there
are
different
dates
of
running
and
all.
just
pick
the
two
that
you
think
are
the
worst.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
be
much
happier
if
you
told
me
about
one
in
this
particular
record,
the
two
offices
in
this
record
that
you
think
there
is
the
most
arbitrary
discrimination
between
the
two.
unknown
speaker
county
judge?
unknown
speaker
he
is
governed
by
section
19,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
be
rational
for
a
legislature
to
think
that
they
should
protect
the
public
from
confusing
these
various
courts
and
judges,
so
that
the
judge
on
this
county
court
you
speak
of
would
be
precluded
from
having
his
picture
and
his
posters
out
around
the
area,
saying,
keep
judge
moreo
on
the
bench.
the
public
might
think
they
should
keep
him
on
when
in
fact
he
is
running
for
a
different
office.
isn't
that
a
factor
a
legislature
is
entitled
to
take
into
account?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
county
judge
running
for
the
next
highest
court.
unknown
speaker
do
the
courts
have
the
same
kind
of
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
they
have
broader
jurisdiction
than
the
district
judges?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no?
i
don't
need
the
examples.
does
one
have
a
different
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
and
they
get
different
salaries?
unknown
speaker
what
is
their
claim...
what
constitutional
provision
do
they
rely
on
to
say
they
are
entitled
to
be
treated
equally?
they
are
not
treated
equally.
they
are
different
offices,
they
are
paid
different
salaries,
with
different
jurisdictions.
unknown
speaker
could
not
the
legislature,
which
now
pays
one
more
than
the
other,
change
its
mind
and
decide
to
pay
that
one
less
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
does
it
have
to
have
a
reason
other
than
they
just
want
to
save
some
money?
unknown
speaker
what
past
cases
deal
with
any
requirement
to
treat
different
offices
equally?
the
men
or
women
occupy
different
offices.
why
must
the
offices
be
alike?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
to
review
the
distinction
in
salary
or
distinction
in
jurisdiction?
why
is
there
a
federal
reason
why
those
different
offices
have
to
have
similar
treatment?
i
don't
understand
the
basic
premise
on
which
the
whole
case
rests.
why
can't
texas
create
the
xyz
court,
give
it
precisely
the
same
jurisdiction
as
some
other
court,
but
just
pay
the
judges
a
different
salary
if
it
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
and
then
why
can't
it
say,
well,
those
judges
have
to
resign
to
run,
but
other
judges
don't?
unknown
speaker
they
occupy
different
offices.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
talk
about
distinctions,
supposing
that
a
county
court
judge
is
paid
$15,000
and
a
district
court
judge
is
paid
$20,000,
and
then
the
legislature
decides
to
raise
the
salary
of
the
district
judge
to
$25,000
but
not
raise
the
salary
of
the
county
court
judge
at
all,
so
that
whereas
the
county
court
judge
used
to
make
75
percent
of
what
the
district
judge
made,
now
he
makes
60
percent.
do
you
think
that
is
subject
to
attack
under
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
supposing
this
was
something
done
back
in
'54
or
'56,
and
the
state
is
in
the
position
that
they
can't
explain
at
all
why
the
legislature
decided
to
do
this?
do
you
think
that
then
would
be
subject
to
attack
under
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
my
example
a
burden?
unknown
speaker
would
you
urge
that
we
apply
a
rational
basis
standard
then?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
distinguish
the
letter
carriers
case,
where
the
court
upheld
the
hatch
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
is
a
policy
of
long
standing
in
section
19
of
the
state
constitution.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
supposing
the
postmaster
general
put
into
effect
a
policy
against
political
activity
such
as
in
letter
carriers,
and
the
secretary
of
hew
did
not.
could
the
postal
workers
claim
a
denial
of
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
so
if
any
one
department
of
government
imposes
some
such
restriction
like
this,
it
is
invalid
unless
it
is
put
into
effect
throughout
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
starting
with
an
assumption
that
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
that
there
be
equal
treatment.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
are
a
little
too
broad
on
different
agencies.
i
know
some
agencies
in
this
government
you
can
write
and
print
whatever
you
want,
and
i
know
others
you
can't.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
this
court
has
passed
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
constitutional
decision?
unknown
speaker
it
was
meant
to
but
it
wasn't
based
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
mind
if
i
am
not
bound
by
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
the
legislature
and
the
people
of
texas
haven't
a
right
to
say
that
if
we
have
a
person
in
this
particular
office,
we
want
him
to
spend
all
his
time,
devote
all
his
energies
to
that
office,
and
not
dissipate
his
time
and
energies
by
running
for
another
office
while
he
is
holding
the
first
one
to
which
he
was
elected.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
is
another
option
that
is
always
open,
i
guess.
they
could
resign
their
offices
to
practice
law
privately
or
whatever
their
skills
might
be,
go
into
the
private
sector
and
then
run.
they
are
not
totally
disabled.
unknown
speaker
i
know
a
lot
of
judges
who
have
resigned.
unknown
speaker
that
is
really
ironic,
because
my
experience
has
been
that
most
judges
think
lawyers
are
better
paid
than
they
are.
they
don't
think
it
is
a
great
sacrifice
to
go
out
and
have
a
chance
to
practice
privately.
well,
mr.
caballero,
as
i
understand
it,
under
section
19,
the
judge
could
not
resign
and
run
for
the
legislature.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
that
score,
the
people
of
texas,
having
adopted
that,
have
expressed
the
view
that
if
we
elect
you
to
an
office,
we
expect
you
to
stay
there
until
the
end
of
your
term,
and
this
is
one
inducement,
if
not
a
pressure,
to
keep
you
there,
that
you
can't
run
for
any
other
office.
unknown
speaker
they
have
said
that
in
the
constitution,
haven't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
a
lot
of
people
in
texas
would
say
that
is
none
of
anybody's
business
except
the
people
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
article
iii,
section
19,
would
not
prevent
you
from
running
in
the
last
year
of
your
office
for
the
legislature
if
your
legislative
term
would
begin
at
the
expiration
of
your
own
term?
unknown
speaker
it
would
what?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
begin
running
whenever
you
wanted
to,
as
far
as
article
iii,
section
19,
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
the
term
for
which
you
are
running
begins
at
the
expiration
of
your
own.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
so
under
65.
