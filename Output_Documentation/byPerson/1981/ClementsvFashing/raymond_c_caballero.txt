mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
texas
in
article
xvi,
section
40,
has
a
prohibition
against
dual
officeholding.
that
means
that
you
cannot
hold
more
than
one
lucrative
office
at
the
same
time.
article
xvi,
section
65,
is
not
a
dual
officeholding
prohibition.
article
iii,
section
19,
started
out
as
a
dual
officeholding
provision,
and
in
1836,
they
added
that
clause,
"during
the
term
for
which
he
is
elected
or
appointed.
"
that
is
what
causes
the
problem
in
iii,
19,
that
i
will
be
discussing
later
on.
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
here,
section
65
of
article
xvi
was
passed
in
1954,
after
the
resolution
of
the
legislature
to
place
it
on
the
ballot
for
the
revision
of
the
constitution
at
the
general
election,
and
its
purpose,
and
if
you
look
at
the
headnote,
says
it
is
a
transitional
article
to
provide
for
the
staggering
of
elections
between
the
various
officeholders
who
had
been
granted
four-year
terms.
in
1958,
the
paragraph
in
question
here
in
section
65
was
also
made
part
of
the
constitution,
and
at
exactly
the
same
time,
verbatim,
the
same
clause
came
into
article
xi,
section
11,
that
i
will
be
discussing
here
in
just
a
second.
there
is
no
reason
that
i
know,
nor
did
the
state
advance
any
in
the
courts
below,
other
than
that
it...
well,
the
state
in
the
court
below
simply
said
that
it
was
going
to
prevent
abuse
of
office,
and
therefore
that
is
why
the
article
was
placed
in
there.
now,
the
question
was
raised
here
this
morning
that
the
district
court
made
an
error
of
fact
or
of
law
in
neglecting
to
mention
article
xi,
section
11.
that
was
the
provision
enacted
in
1958
which
allowed
cities
in
the
state
of
texas
to
give
four-year
terms
to
mayors
and
members
of
the
city
council.
they
had
to
vote
it
in.
they
didn't
give
it
automatically.
very
few
cities
took
advantage
of
that
provision
to
give
members
of
its
city
council
four-year
terms.
perhaps
counsel
here
in
rebuttal
can
mention
one.
i
don't
know
of
any,
but
there
may
be
some.
certainly
el
paso,
texas,
where
this
case
arose,
did
not
take
advantage
of
it,
and
where
judge
hudspeth
sat
at
the
time
members
of
the
city
council
and
municipal
courts
only
had
terms
of
two
years.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
apologize.
the
municipal
court
judges
had
four-year
terms,
but
under
our
provision,
we
do
not
have
the
application
in
el
paso
nor
in
most
areas
of
the
state
of
texas
of
the
four-year
article
xi,
section
11,
statute.
the
members
of
the
city
council
run
for
two
years,
but
the
municipal
court
judges
have
four-year
terms,
but
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
offices
in...
i
am
sorry,
they
have
two-year
terms.
that
statute
does
not
apply
in
el
paso.
my
confusion
is...
is
this.
the
problem
here
is
that
municipal
court
judges
run...
municipal
elections
in
texas
are
in
odd
years.
state
and
county
elections
are
in
even
years.
that
means
that
a
municipal
court
judge,
when
he
comes
around,
he
wants
to
run
in
a
state
election,
in
an
even
year,
does
not
have
to
resign
the
office,
even
though
he
is
only
holding
a
two-year
term.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
he
has
less
than
a
year
to
go.
there
is
no
prohibition
at
all
to
a
municipal
court
judge
running.
now,
the
times
here
as
far
as
the
texas
election
process
is
concerned
are
important.
the
filing
date
in
texas
since
1959
has
been
the
first
monday
in
february
of
an
even
year.
the
way
you
are
elected
is,
your
term
runs
until
january
31st
of
an
even
year.
that
means,
for
example,
if
my
term
as
a
judge
or
another
officeholder,
i
would
be
in
office
now.
if
i
wanted
to
run
for
another
office,
i
would
have
to
file
by
february
1.
however,
if
i
went
out
and
solicited
any
kind
of
support
for
that
other
office
prior
to
january
1
of
this
year,
the
statute
does
not
say
private
announcement
or
public
announcement,
it
simply
says
by
the
mere
solicitation
of
a
campaign
contribution,
or
the
announcement
of
any
kind,
i
am
going
to
be
a
candidate
for
some
other
office.
that
automatically
causes
you
to
vacate
your
office.
an
officeholder...
and
therefore
you
lose
that
office
immediately,
and
you
lose
your
livelihood
for
a
period
of
a
year,
even
if
you
win
the
office
that
you
are
now
seeking,
and
that
is
even
if
you
are
running
in
the
last
year
of
your
term.
it
is
even
worse
if
you
are
running
mid-term,
that
is,
if
you
have
a
four-year
term
and
you
are
running
two
years
into
your
term,
because
then
you
lose
three
years
of
your
term.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
that
is
one
thing
that
i
am
arguing,
that
this
statute...
and
i
argued
in
the
court
below,
this
statute
has
problems.
both
statutes
have
problems.
even
if
you...
well,
section
65
has
problems
even
if
you
applied
it
to
everyone.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
because
it
imposes
a
burden
on
voters
and
on
candidates
that
is
unnecessary.
what
goal
is
it,
your
honor,
that
you
are
trying
to
further
by
placing
a
burden?
when
you
place
a
burden
on
election
rights,
our
contention
is
there
should
be
some
reason
for
it.
the
state
has
been
able
to
advance,
according
to
the
district
court,
no
valid
reason
for
placing
such
burdens
on
candidates.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
there
are
states
that
provide
that
for
certain
offices
you
can
only
hold
office
for
one
term.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
don't
know
of
any
prohibition
against
providing
for
one
term.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
more
stringent.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
the
problem
with
this
provision
is--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
the
problem
is,
when
you
are
running
for
that
one
term,
your
honor,
you
run
for
the
one
term
knowing
that
you
were
going
to
keep
the
one
term.
the
problem--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--you
run
knowing
probably
that
you
cannot
campaign
for
any
other
office.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
think
that
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
policy
generally
should
be
that...
i
think
you
mentioned
in
one
of
your
opinions...
there
are
two...
there
are
competing
policies
here.
it
used
to
be
that,
one,
you
wanted
to
shorten
the
ballot,
and
the
other
policy
was
that
you
wanted
to
provide
people
access
to
the
ballot
and
ways
to
express
their
viewpoints.
in
this
case,
the
problem
is,
you
would
like
to
keep
people
in
office
and
have
them
tend
to
their
office
and
not
be
running
for
other
offices.
that
is
one
policy.
the
competing
policy
is,
there
are
various
judges
on
this
very
court
who
have
come
from
other
courts.
the
policy
has
been
that
you
want
people
to
move
up
the
political
ladder,
to
move
up
to
higher
office.
this
defeats
that
policy.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
it
is
not
written
anywhere,
your
honor.
just
the
policy
generally--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--no,
you--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
true,
but
in
texas,
judges
are
political,
not
appointed.
you
have
to
run
for
office
in
texas.
that
is
a
decision
made
by
the
legislature,
obviously
making
judges
political
persons,
as
opposed
to
some
states--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--without
first
resigning?
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
my
offhand
impression
would
be
that
it
would
not,
your
honor.
now,
there
is--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--it
used
to
be
the
law
in
the
state
of
texas,
and
in
the
moreo
case
there
was
a
prohibition
of
judicial
officers
running
for
non-judicial
office.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
prohibition
in
texas
was
removed
some
time
ago.
i
can
see
a
state
validly,
as
in
the
moreo
case,
with
which
we
have
no
quarrel,
saying
a
judicial
officer
may
not
run
for
non-judicial
office
without
resigning
the
judicial
office
first.
that
was
upheld
in
moreo.
in
this
case,
we
would
not
have
a
first
amendment
claim,
we
would
have
strictly
an
equal
protection
claim,
were
that
the
case.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
all
right.
i
will
give
you
a
couple.
there
is
actually
a
case,
and
you
can
take
the
cite
here,
it
is
377
southwest
2nd,
and
it
is
also
reported
in
380
southwest
2nd.
i
think
it
was
cited
in
the
earlier
briefs,
not
before
this
court,
by
the
state.
that
is
the
case
of
willis
versus
potts,
willis
versus
fort
worth.
it
involves
really
both
provisions
that
are
akin
to
the
ones
that
we
have
in
question
here
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
all
right,
i
think,
for
example,
county
judge.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
a
county
court
of
law
judge
who
desires
to
run
for
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
which
is
the
next
court
of
appeals
up
above
that
court.
contrasted
with
a
district
court
judge,
also
a
trial
judge,
sitting
alone,
who
also
reports
to
the
same
appellate
court.
the
district
judge
is
not
governed
by
section
65.
he
may
run
midway
through
a
four-year
term,
keep
office,
even
if
he
lost.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
he
may
not
run
for
the
legislature,
your
honor.
that
is
because
it
is
a
lucrative
office.
that
is
correct.
he
is
ineligible
for
that
section.
the
county
court
of
law
judge,
let's
say
that
both
seek
the
same
office.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that
is
sort
of
the...
that
is
a
factor,
but
that
is
the
judicial
officer
running
for
a
non-judicial
position,
i
think
is
what
you
are
raising,
which
is
not
really
the
question.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
you
can
say
that,
but
why
would
you
then
turn
around
and
say
that
a
district
judge
can
do
that
which
a
county
court
of
law
judge
does
not?
there
has
to
be
some
reason
for
the
distinction.
the
state
was
unable
to
come
up
with
any
reasons
at
all,
even
in
their
brief.
they
said,
we
have
already
discussed
that
distinction.
they
didn't.
they
never
did
discuss
the
distinction.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
akin.
the
county
courts
at
law,
being
creatures
of
the
legislature,
are
given
all
kinds
of
different
jurisdictions.
some
of
them
have
family,
divorce--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--for
example,
in
probate,
they
have
plenary
jurisdiction.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes.
the
district
court--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--yes,
they
do.
the
district
court--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--they
are
not
entitled
to
be
treated
equally,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
are
not
treated
equally
there
has
to
be
some
reason
for
it.
the
state--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--conceivably
they
could.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
under
your
past
cases
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
yes,
they
do
have
to
have
a
reason
when
they
treat
people--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--the
offices
do
not
have
to
be
alike,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
have
made
a
distinction,
there
has
to
be
some,
even
at
the
lowest
level
of
scrutiny.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
it
could.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
because
there,
when
you--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--when
you
are
paying
one
more
than
the
other,
perhaps
it
is
subject
to
attack.
perhaps
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
you
pay
one
judge
more
than
the
other.
i
am
just
assuming
that
one
perhaps
has
more
jurisdiction
than
the
other,
but
when
you
are
allowing
two
men
with
basically
the
same
qualifications
to
run
for
the
same
appellate
office,
they
are
both
qualified
to
run
for
the
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
on
the
one
hand,
you
say,
judge,
you
are
a
judge
of
the
county
court
of
law,
therefore
you
lose
your
office;
you
are
a
judge
of
the
district
court,
you
get
to
keep
your
office.
this
court
has
said
even
at
the
lowest
level
of
scrutiny
there
has
to
be
some
reason
for
the
distinction.
the
state
cannot
come
up
with
any.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
it
may
be
subject
to
attack
if
there
was
no
reason,
if
the
state...
i
can
see
the
state
easily
coming
up
with
a
reason
for
that
distinction.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
for
example,
if
this
court
were
to
examine
it
and
find
no
reasonable...
in
other
words,
if
you
are
placing
burdens
on
some
and
not
on
others,
and
you
are
unable
to
come
up
with
any
reason,
and
you
have
burdened
some
rights,
then
i
think
the
state
statute
is
subject
to
attack.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
suppose
it
is
a
burden
of
sorts.
i
suppose
someone
could
conceivably
come
up
with
an
argument.
here
you
are
talking
about
something
that
goes
way
beyond
a
mere
distinction
of
salaries.
you
are
talking
about
a
person
who
is
subject
to
losing
office,
and
another
person
who
is
not
subject
to
losing
office,
a
tremendous
distinction,
not
one
of
mere
degree,
but
almost
of
kind.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
your
honor,
i
am
urging
that
you
apply
a
balancing
test,
kind
of
like
you
did
in
letter
carriers,
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
below
suggested
in
moreo,
and
that
is,
the
closer...
that
is
a
good
example.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
there,
the
interests
of
the
government
were
tremendous.
there
is
a
policy
of
long
standing
that
in
civil
service
in
the
united
states,
you
want
to
keep
them
as
free
as
possible
from
political
pressures.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
your
honor,
that
is
what
i
was
saying.
i
don't
know
of
any
policy
other
than
it
is
a
legislative
enactment.
i
am
talking
about
a
reason
for
it.
for
example,
in
letter
carriers,
there
is
a
reason.
we
don't
want
civil
servants
to
become
involved
in
the
political
process
to
the
extent
where
they
themselves
become
partisans.
the
reason
behind
section
19,
the
state
of
texas
has
been
able
to
come
up
with
one.
they
said
it
that
prevents
conflicts
of
interest.
and
then
you
pose
the
hypothetical,
what
happens
if
i
resign
my
office?
therefore
there
would
be
no
possible
conflict
of
interest.
i
am
still
rendered
ineligible.
in
that
situation,
they
have
come
up
with
no
distinction
whatsoever,
no
reason
for
it.
the
policy
decision
that
i
was
speaking
of
earlier
is
not
one
that
is
contained
so
much
in
the
legislation
or
is
embodied
in
the
legislation,
but
simply
something
the
government
has
come
up
with,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
you
have
civil
service
on
the
federal
side.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
they
could,
i
would
think,
if
they--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that...
the
argument
was
raised
by
defendants
in
those
cases,
you
know,
you
can't
expect
a
legislature
to
enact
everything
all
at
once
so
everything
is
uniform,
and
this
court
has
held
that
if
someone
brings
a
complaint
that
they
are
being
treated
unequally,
that
you
cannot
guess
and
say,
well,
maybe
they...
this
statute
that
we
have
here
in
this
case
has
been
around
for
23
years.
i
don't
know
how
long
we
have
to
wait
for
the
legislature
to
come
up
with
the
provisions
to
make
it
equal
treatment.
1836,
i
would
think,
is
long
enough
on
section
19.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
there
is,
your
honor.
there
is,
equal
treatment
to
the
extent
that
there
is
not,
that
there
should
be
some
reason
for
it.
that
is
the
test
of
this
court.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that
is
true,
and
in
application--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--in
the
willis
case
that
i
was
going
to
mention
earlier,
it
is
two
cases,
and
i
think
they
really
illustrate
the
problems
with
both
cases.
willis
was
a
congressman
from
fort
worth.
willis
decided
that
he
was
going
to
run
for
the
state
senate.
willis
announced
for
election.
filed
his
application,
or
tried
to
file
his
application
with
the
democratic
chairman
there
in
tarrant
county,
and
the
chairman
said
no,
section
19
makes
you
ineligible
to
run
for
the
texas
senate
because
your
term,
even
if
you
resign
today,
would
be
extending
into
the
legislative
term
sought.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
it
was
mentioned,
but
it
was
not
based
on
the
constitution.
they
simply
went
and
upheld--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--the
court
did
not
say...
the
court
found
nothing
wrong
with
the
provisions
under
the
texas
or
the
u.
s.
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
don't
think
you
are
bound
by
the
willis
decision.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
but
i
am
mentioning
it
simply
because
of
the
facts
that
it
raises.
now,
in
willis,
after
this
person
was
held
to
be
ineligible
to
run
for
the
texas
senate,
as
soon
as
he
announced
for
the
texas
senate,
though
he
by
law
could
not
become
a
candidate,
it
was
held
by
the
fort
worth
city
council
that
he
had
resigned
his
office
because
they
had
a...
it
was
not
65,
but
it
was
something
akin
to
65
that
says
as
soon
as
you
announce
for
another
office,
you
lose
your
spot
on
the
city
council.
so
willis
then
filed
a
second
lawsuit,
and
said,
since
i
can't
be
a
candidate
for
the
texas
senate,
i
was
never
a
candidate,
i
should
not
be
losing
my
office.
and
they
held
there,
they
applied
what
in
effect
was
section
65
in
the
fort
worth
city
charter,
and
held
that
he
had
lost
his
office
also.
and
that's
the
kind
of
situation
you
get
here.
you
are
not
eligible
to
be
a
candidate.
for
example,
judge
baca
in
this
case,
who
wants
to
run
for
the
legislature,
cannot
file
for
the
legislature.
first
of
all,
he
is
ineligible.
secondly,
as
soon
as
he
files
or
announces
for
office,
he
loses
the
one
year
remaining
in
his
term.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
the
people
of
the
state
of
texas,
your
honor,
i
suppose
could
say
that,
but
what
has
happened
is
that
they
have
said
some
officeholders
we
are
going
to
apply
the
rule
to,
and
some
we
are
not.
for
example,
if
a
district
attorney
decides
to
run
for
governor,
loses
his
office;
the
attorney
general
decides
to
run
for
governor,
he
does
not
lose
his
office.
in
the
state's
brief
in
this
case,
they
say
that
it
shouldn't
be
applied
to
state
officeholders
because
they
are
unlikely
to
run
for
higher
office,
when
in
fact
this
present
attorney
general
has
already
filed...
he
has
announced
for
office.
the
previous
attorney
general,
john
hill,
filed
and
ran
for
office
and
lost.
neither
one
of
them
lost
their
terms.
texas
has
256
counties.
to
allow
you
only
37
days
to
test
the
waters,
to
see
whether
or
not
you
want
to
run
for
office,
is
so
restrictive
a
burden
as
to
be
unrealistic.
what
has
happened
also
is
that
these
provisions
were
enacted
in
1958.
at
that
time,
the
filing
deadline
in
texas
was
in
june,
which
gave
you
about
five
months
to
test
the
waters.
immediately
after
these
provisions
were
enacted,
and
i
don't
know
how
much
thought
was
given
to
it.
there
is
no
legislative
history.
in
1959,
the
legislature
moved
up
the
filing
deadline
to
the
first
monday
in
february
of
each
year,
so
you
lost
about
four
months
of
this
testing
of
the
waters
period.
before,
it
may
have
been
reasonable,
with
a
june
deadline.
now,
with
37
days,
saying
you
cannot
run
for
statewide
office
or
for
any
other
office;
if
you
merely
seek
office
you
have
lost
your
present
office,
that
has
such
a
chilling
effect
that
it
has
prevented
a
lot
of
people,
including
my
clients
in
this
case,
they
claim
in
affidavits
and
in
pleadings
that
they
will
not
run
for
those
offices
so
long
as
we
are
looking
at
these
legislative
provisions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
they
are
not
totally
disabled,
but
if
you
take
judges,
that
is
an
unrealistic
alternative.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
there
are
some
who
have
resigned,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
are
many
others...
trying
to
crank
up
a
law
practice
when
you
think
you
might
win
and
have
to
go
back
into
judicial
office--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--under
section
19,
it
makes
no
difference
if
you
resign.
you
are
ineligible
regardless.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
so
long
as
your
term
extends
into
the
next
legislative
season.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
can
see
them
saying
that,
and
i
think
it
is
a
fine
policy.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
if
it
is
such
a
compelling
policy,
why
haven't
they
said
that
for
the
other
officeholders?
it
leads
you
to
believe
maybe
it
is
not
such
a
valid
reason.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that
is
true.
that
has
been
advanced.
but
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
when
you
do
make
a
distinction
between
officeholders,
they
have
to
give
you
at
least,
even
under
the
minimum
level
of
scrutiny,
some
reason
for
it,
some
valid
reason
for
it,
and
the
state
of
texas
cannot.
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
area,
if
you
look
at
the
interrogatories
or
if
you
look
at
the
brief,
they
have
not
mentioned
any
reason
for
the
legislative
distinction
in
section
65
other
than
the
one
you
mentioned,
your
honor,
and
that
was
legislative
oversight.
that
i
contend
is
not
a
valid
reason.
they
simply
said
it
was
not
before
the
people
in
1958.
they
are
agreeing
that
they
never
even
considered
it,
your
honor,
not
that
they
had
some
reasons.
thank
you.
