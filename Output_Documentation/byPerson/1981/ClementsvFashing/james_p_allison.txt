mr.
james
p.
allison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
article
xvi,
section
65
of
the
texas
constitution,
the
resign
to
run
provision,
and
article
iii,
section
19,
concerning
eligibility
to
the
state
legislature.
the
action
was
brought
for
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
alleging
violation
of
the
first,
fifth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
u.
s.
constitution.
the
officeholder
plaintiffs
were
a
judge
of
the
county
court
at
law,
two
justices
of
the
peace,
and
a
constable.
other
plaintiffs
included
citizens
and
registered
voters.
the
defendants
were
the
local
and
state
officers
who
were
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
challenged
provisions.
the
district
court
held
that
both
article
xvi,
section
65,
and
article
iii,
section
19,
contravened
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
u.
s.
constitution,
and
therefore
the
district
court
granted
the
plaintiffs'
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
injunctive
relief.
the
u.
s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
opinion
adopted
in
the
memorandum
pending
in
the
district
court.
a
short,
very
brief
historical
background
on
these
provisions
and
the
texas
political
system
would
be
helpful
in
analyzing
these
provisions.
the
current
texas
constitution
was
adopted
in
1876.
the
constitution
provides
for
a
very
decentralized
system
of
government.
under
this
constitution,
almost
all
local
and
state
offices
are
elected,
and
from
1876
until
the
1950s
each
of
these,
almost
all
of
these
were
elected
for
a
two-year
term.
in
the
1950s,
four-year
terms
were
extended
to
most
of
these
offices.
in
1954,
four-year
terms
were
extended
to
the
precinct
and
county
offices
included
in
article
xvi,
section
65.
in
1958,
after
the
people
of
the
state
had
extended
four-year
terms
to
these
offices,
the
resign
to
run
provision
in
article
xvi,
section
65,
was
adopted.
article
iii,
section
19
has
been
included
in
the
texas
constitution
since
the
constitution
of
the
republic
of
texas
was
drafted
in
1836.
i
would
first
like
to
point
out
an
error
in
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
district
court
in
its
memorandum
opinion.
the
district
court
found
and
apparently
relied
heavily
upon
a
distinction
between
the
application
of
the
resign
to
run
rule
to
the
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
and
its
application
to
the
office
of
municipal
court
judge.
the
district
court
stated
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
is
included
under
article
xvi,
section
65,
and
the
municipal
court
judge,
who
has
very
similar
jurisdiction,
is
not,
and
found
that
to
be
a
distinction
of
some
great
importance
in
finding
that
the
resign
to
run
rule
contravened
the
constitution.
what
the
district
court
overlooked
was
article
xi,
section
11
of
the
texas
constitution,
adopted
in
1958,
at
the
same
time
as
the
resign
to
run
rule
in
article
xvi,
section
65.
article
xi,
section
11,
states
that
any
municipality
which
extends
the
terms
of
its
officers
from
two
years
to
four
years,
that
once
that
is
done,
that
those
officers
will
be
under
the
same
resign
to
run
provisions
as
offices
that
are
under
article
xvi,
section
65.
so
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
application
of
the
resign
to
run
rules,
between
the
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
and
any
municipal
office,
whether
it
be
municipal
judge--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--no,
your
honor.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
was
not.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
did
not
have
this
case
until
after
the
fifth
circuit
had
ruled
on
it.
mr.
james
p.
allison
no,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
they
are
not.
mr.
james
p.
allison
because
no
one
with
a
two-year
term
is
subject
to
the
resign
to
run
rule.
only
when
they
adopt
a
four-year
term.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
think
it
destroys
the
contrast,
because
any
time
that
a
municipal
judge
is
in
the
same
position
as
a
justice
of
the
peace,
that
is,
holding
a
four-year
term,
it
is
under
exactly
the
same
rule.
mr.
james
p.
allison
it
might.
mr.
james
p.
allison
article
iii,
section
19,
or
article
xvi,
section
65?
mr.
james
p.
allison
no,
it
is
subject
to
article
iii,
section
19.
in
analyzing
these
provisions,
i
think
it
important
to
note
the
activities
or
rights
which
are
not
restricted
under
these
two
provisions.
there
is
no
question
that
the
right
to
vote
is
not
included
and
is
not
restricted
under
either
of
these
provisions.
neither
is
the
right
to
support
other
candidates,
the
right
to
speak
out
on
issues,
or
the
right
to
test
the
water.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
don't
think...
i
think
you
can
correct
it
by
reversing
the
judgment.
i
pointed
out
simply
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion,
and
using
it--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--it
appears
to
be.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
well--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--in
this
case--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--in
this
case,
it
appears
to
be
a
conclusion
of
law
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
rule--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--i
think
you
would
have
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
application
of
resign
to
run
rules
between
these
two
offices.
mr.
james
p.
allison
if
it
were
presented
to
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
think
it
is
both.
i
think
the
court
was
in
error
as
to
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
resign
to
run
rule
applicable
to
the
municipal
court
judges,
and
then
did
arrive
at
an
erroneous
conclusion
of
law
that
article
xvi,
section
65,
creates
a
difference
in
classification
between
the
two
offices.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
do
not
know.
i
don't
know
if
the
judge
would
straighten
it
out
had
he--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--to
my
knowledge,
it
was
not.
mr.
james
p.
allison
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
it
was
called
to
his
attention
at
that
time.
mr.
james
p.
allison
right.
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
james
p.
allison
no,
sir,
he
overlooked
article
xi,
section
11,
of
the
texas
constitution.
mr.
james
p.
allison
no,
sir,
it
was
adopted
at
the
same
time
as
article
xvi,
section
65,
the
resign
to
run
provision.
it
was
on
the
same
ballot.
mr.
james
p.
allison
no,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
allison
right.
mr.
james
p.
allison
that's
correct.
i
would
further
point
out
that
among
the
activities
not
restricted
to
article
xvi,
section
65,
is
the
right
to
test
the
water,
that
persons
who
contemplate
running
for
office
in
texas
have
the
opportunity
to
go
out
and
solicit
possible
support
without
having
to
resign
an
office,
and
that
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
position
taken
by
the
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case.
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
texas
resign
to
run
rule
does
not
involve
any
suspect
classifications.
there
is
no
direct
burden
on
any
particular
portion
of
the
electorate
or
upon
any
particular
political
viewpoint.
the
only
effects
upon
the
voters
would
be
if
they
wished
to
support
a
particular
candidate
and
that
candidate
was
in
mid-term
of
an
office
he
was
holding
at
the
time,
and
he
declined
to
run
because
of
the
resign
to
run
rule.
in
that
limited
sense
you
could
say
that
the
article
xvi,
section
65,
resign
to
run
provision
has
some
slight
effect
upon
the
pool
of
candidates
available
to
the
voters.
otherwise,
it
has
none.
article
xvi,
section
65,
appears
to
be
a
unique
resign
to
run
provision.
although
a
majority
of
the
states
now
have
some
resign
to
run
rule,
article
xvi,
section
65
differs
as
nearly
as
i
can
determine
from
all
of
these,
in
that
article
xvi,
section
65,
applies
only
to
the
first
three
years
of
a
four-year
term.
in
the
last
year
of
your
term
in
texas,
you
are
free
to
run
for
any
office,
either
re-election
of
the
office
you
then
hold
or
for
any
other
office
that
you
might
choose
to
announce
for.
i
believe
this
is
important
in
weighing
the
rationale
behind
the
adoption
of
the
resign
to
run
rule.
in
1954,
when
the
four-year
terms
were
extended,
replacing
the
two-year
terms,
the
people
of
texas
staggered
the
terms
to
be
served.
that
is,
they
provided
that
approximately
one-half
of
the
officeholders
would
come
up
every
two
years,
thereby
shortening
the
ballot.
what
this
also
did
was
create
a
temptation
and
an
opportunity
for
an
officeholder
in
mid-term,
in
the
middle
of
the
four-year
term
that
had
been
extended
to
him,
to
run
for
another
office,
to
take
a
free
ride
while
continuing
to
hold
the
office
that
he
had
been
elected
to
for
a
four-year
term.
the
state
interests
served
by
the
resign
to
run
rule
have
been
widely
discussed
in
other
cases,
and
were
recognized
by
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
in
this
case.
the
resign
to
run
rule
prevents
abuse
of
office,
and
in
this
case,
by
applying
it
to
the
first
three
years
of
the
term,
it
also
prevents
neglect
of
the
duties
of
the
office,
and
that
a
person
may
not
go
out
and
use
his
time
to
run
for
office
while
occupying
the
office
he
has
been
elected
to.
it
also
prevents
abuse
of
office
by
a
losing
candidate
who
if
he
were
allowed
to
run
in
mid-term
would
return
to
the
office
that
he
had
presently
held
and
continue
to
serve
for
two
years
after
having
run
and
lost
for
another
race,
and
certainly
it
also
eliminates
even
the
appearance
of
impropriety
of
candidates
who
are
holding
an
office
being
allowed
to
run
for
higher
office
or
other
office
in
the
middle
of
their
term.
there
is
no
less
restrictive
means
to
achieve
these
ends.
the
other
possibilities,
a
leave
of
absence
provision,
for
example,
would
certainly
not
prevent
the
abuse
of
office
by
a
losing
candidate
who
would
return
to
the
office.
the
criminal
statute,
which
prohibits
abuse
of
office
or
abuse
of
official
power,
does
not
in
any
way
affect
the
neglect
of
duties
that
could
occur
while
an
officeholder
left
his
office
and
went
out
and
ran
for
another
office
in
the
middle
of
his
term.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
i
certainly
see
an
analogy
between
that
and
article
iii,
section
18,
of
the
texas
constitution,
which
has
the
same
provision,
and
i
have
cited
it
further
in
my
argument.
and
i
certainly
see
an
analogy
between
that
and
the
provisions
of
both
the
federal
hatch
act
and
the
state
hatch
act,
which
also
prohibits
candidacy.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
the
appellees
here,
argue
that
apparently
the
resign
to
run
rule
is
defective
because
it
is
under-inclusive.
they
argue
that
it
does
not
apply
to
everyone,
it
only
applies
to
them.
and
it
is
true
that
there
are
a
number
of
offices
excepted
from
the
rule.
the
process
at
arriving
at
a
decision
through
the
legislature
is
always
one
of
compromise,
and
certainly
that
was
involved
in
the
arriving
at
this
resign
to
run
rule,
but
to
hold
the
resign
to
run
rule
unconstitutional
simply
because
it
makes
too
many
exceptions
would
require
that
a
statute
or
constitutional
provision
either
go
all
the
way
in
treating
a
problem
or
not
attack
the
problem
at
all.
mr.
james
p.
allison
possibly,
though
i
would
certainly
point
out
that
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
only
serve
a
two-year
term
anyway,
so
the
resign
to
run
rule
purpose
of
preventing
them
from
neglecting
their
duties
in
mid-term
while
running
for
another
office
would
have
no
application
to
them,
because
they
have
to
run
either
for
re-election
or
for
other
office
every
two
years.
the
state
senate,
that
may
have
been
the
case.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
think
that
the
provisions
can
be
upheld
on
the
basis
of
any
rational
basis
for
their
application,
but
if
you
go
beyond
that--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--unfortunately,
at
the
time
these
provisions
were
adopted,
1954
and
1958,
there
was
no
legislative
history
as
such
in
texas.
mr.
james
p.
allison
amendments
proposed
by
the
legislature,
adopted
by
the
people.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
would
point
out
that
the
exceptions
found
in
article
xvi,
section
65,
are
not
classes
of
persons.
they
do
not
involve
any
suspect
categories.
they
are
exceptions
of
specific
positions,
and
the
presumption
there
is
that
the
legislature
based
these
exemptions
upon
some
circumstances
within
their
knowledge,
and
that
the
judiciary
will
not
normally
invade
that
province
of
the
legislature.
article
iii,
section
19,
has
been
similarly
attacked
on
the
same
basis,
that
it
creates
classifications,
and
the
same
arguments
apply.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
standing
of
these
plaintiffs
to
attack
article
iii,
section
19,
is
particularly
objected
to
by
the
appellants
in
that
there
is
no
plaintiff
who
indicated
a
definite
intention
to
run
for
the
legislature.
article
iii,
section
19,
provides
that
any
person
holding
a
lucrative
office
in
the
state
shall
not
be
eligible
for
the
legislature
during
the
term
for
which
they
are
elected.
none
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
indicated
that
they
definitely
intended
to
come
within
that
provision.
one
of
the
plaintiffs
said
that
if
it
weren't
for
article
xvi,
section
65,
that
required
him
to
resign
the
position
he
then
held,
he
might
run
for
the
legislature
or
he
might
run
for
one
or
two
other
offices
that
he
named
in
his
affidavit.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
meets
the
standard
case
or
controversy
requirement
in
order
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
article
iii,
section
19.
mr.
james
p.
allison
each
of
them
would.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
they
were
all
holders
of
a
lucrative
office.
mr.
james
p.
allison
except
the
one
who
said
he
might
run
for
the
legislature,
or
he
might
run
for
one
or
two
other
offices
mentioned.
the
district
court
also
did
not
mention
article
iii,
section
18,
which
provides
that
no
senator
or
representative
shall
during
the
term
for
which
he
was
elected
be
eligible
to,
one,
any
civil
office
or
profit
under
this
state
which
shall
have
been
created
or
the
emoluments
of
which
may
have
been
increased
during
such
term,
or
two,
any
office
or
place
the
appointment
to
which
may
be
made
in
whole
or
in
part
by
either
branch
of
the
legislature.
this
is
the
equalizer
between
the
application
of
article
iii,
section
19,
which
says
that
if
you
are
holding
a
lucrative
office
in
another
branch
you
cannot
run
for
the
legislature
during
that
term,
and
article
iii,
section
18,
states
that
if
you
are
in
the
legislature
you
cannot
run
during
your
term
for
an
office
that
you
created
or
increased
the
emoluments
of
or
that
the
legislature
may
act
upon
the
appointment.
that
provision
prevents
abuse
by
legislators.
mr.
james
p.
allison
that's
correct.
i
am
working
on
two
levels.
if
you
adopt
the
rational
basis
argument,
then
any
rational
basis
that
can
be
found
to
sustain
these
provisions
is
sufficient
to
uphold
them,
but
if
you
go
further,
and
if
you
adopt
either
the
means
to
the
end
test
or
some
type
of
balancing
test,
then
these
other
provisions
come
into
play.
mr.
james
p.
allison
not
exactly.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
don't
think
there
is
any.
mr.
james
p.
allison
well,
i
think
you
need
a
rational
basis
when
you
differentiate
or
distinguish
between
the
qualifications
to
be
a
candidate
for
an
office.
mr.
james
p.
allison
you
can.
mr.
james
p.
allison
well,
that
is
a
rational
basis.
mr.
james
p.
allison
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
it
was.
there
is
no
question
that
these
provisions
of
the
texas
constitution
create
some
restrictions
on
candidate
access
to
the
ballot,
but
this
court
in
bullock
versus
carter
set
the
standard
in
stating
that
in
approaching
candidate
restrictions,
it
is
essential
to
examine
in
a
realistic
light
the
extent
and
nature
of
their
impact
on
the
voters.
as
i
have
stated,
these
provisions
serve
legitimate
state
interests.
that
has
not
been
contested
either
at
the
district
court
or
the
fifth
circuit
level.
they
serve
them
in
the
least
restrictive
means
possible,
and
the
classifications
that
are
created
are
reasonably
related
to
the
interests
to
be
achieved,
so
regardless
of
the
standard
adopted,
be
it
rational
basis,
means
to
an
end,
the
ends-means
test,
or
even
strict
scrutiny,
these
provisions
meet
the
standards.
this
court
also
in
u.
s.
civil
service
commission
versus
national
association
of
letter
carriers,
quoted
thomas
jefferson,
stating
as
follows:
"the
right
of
any
officer
to
give
his
vote
at
elections
as
a
qualified
citizen
is
not
meant
to
be
restrained,
nor,
however
given,
shall
it
have
any
effect
to
his
prejudice,
but
it
is
expected
that
he
will
not
attempt
to
influence
the
votes
of
others
nor
take
any
part
in
the
business
of
electioneering,
that
being
deemed
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
his
duties
to
it.
"
the
people
of
the
state
of
texas
have
elected
to
require
their
officers
to
adhere
to
this
principle.
such
is
their
right
under
the
constitution.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
in
the
last
year.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
no,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
in
the
last
year
of
your
four-year
term,
you
can
announce--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
sir.
without
restriction.
mr.
james
p.
allison
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
say.
there
is
no
legislative
history
in
texas
to
support
what
the
rationale
may
have
been
for
the
provisions.
the
defendants
in
this
case
are
the
executive
officers
charged
with
enforcing
them,
and
they
had
no
role
in
the
adoption
of
the
provisions.
to
ask
them
what
was
the
rationale
or
the
basis
in
the
minds
of
the
legislature
at
the
time
they
adopted
the
provision,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
answer.
i
advanced
several
arguments
that
could
have
been,
and
that
certainly
can
be
sustained
as
a
rational
basis
for
these
provisions.
mr.
james
p.
allison
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
appellees
continue
to
state
that
the
article
xvi,
section
65,
provision
prohibits
testing
of
the
water.
and
i
continue
to
state
that
it
does
not.
they
have
cited
a
provision
of
the
election
code
that
defines
candidacy,
but
if
you
read
that
entire
section,
it
concerns
the
financial
requirements
of
candidates
and
states
at
the
beginning
of
the
section
that
the
definitions
therein
apply
only
to
that
chapter.
if
you
look
at
the
state
cases
construing
article
xvi,
section
65,
you
will
not
find
a
single
case
in
which
a
person
has
been
required
to
resign
from
an
office
in
which
they
have
made
anything
other
than
a
clear
and
definite
pronouncement
of
candidacy
for
another
office.
there
is
no
situation
in
which
a
person
has
been
required
to
resign
for
merely
testing
the
waters.
that
is
not
the
situation
in
texas.
in
fact,
the
election
code
was
recently
amended
to
provide
that
if
you
try
to
file
for
another
office
before
january
1,
and
might
thereby
inadvertently
violate
article
xvi,
section
65,
that
your
filing
will
be
declined,
and
it
will
be
refused,
and
that
you
can
only
file
after
january
1,
between
january
1
and
the
first
saturday
in
february,
thereby
preventing
any
inadvertent
violation
of
article
xvi,
section
65.
finally,
also
on
the
question
of
the
burden,
this
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment,
and
the
burden,
if
you
use
the
rational
basis
test,
was
upon
the
plaintiffs
to
show
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
these
provisions,
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
several.
number
one,
article
xvi,
section
65,
applies
to
your
basic
entry
level
stepping
stone
political
positions,
the
precinct
and
county
level
positions,
thereby
providing
a
possible
basis
would
be
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
texas
thought
that
it
is
more
likely
that
someone
entering
at
that
level
would
try
to
run
in
mid-term,
trying
to
step
up
while
trying
to
hold
onto
the
office
that
he
had.
they
are
entitled
to
make
that
distinction.
second,
on
statewide
officials,
such
as
the
attorney
general
running
for
governor,
they
do
not
serve
staggered
terms.
they
are
all
up
at
the
same
time.
their
terms
expire
at
the
same
time,
so
they
would
only
be
running
for
another
state
office
in
the
last
year
of
their
term,
as
provided
in
article
xvi,
section
65,
anyway.
we
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not
met
their
burden
in
this
situation
and
that
these
provisions
do
not
contravene
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
p.
allison
it
would.
mr.
james
p.
allison
it
would
not
prevent
you
from
running
in
the
last
year.
no,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
allison
you
could
run
in
the
last
year
for
the
legislature.
mr.
james
p.
allison
that
is
true.
mr.
james
p.
allison
that's
true.
and
the
terms
all
expire
at
the
last--
mr.
james
p.
allison
--no,
sir.
