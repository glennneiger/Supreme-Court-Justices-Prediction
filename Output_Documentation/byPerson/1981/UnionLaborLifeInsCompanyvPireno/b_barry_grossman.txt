mr.
b.
barry
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
courts:
the
two
courts
below
construed
the
complaint
to
allege
a
conspiracy
which
eliminated
competition
in
the
market
for
the
services
of
chiropractors.
in
the
government's
brief
we
indicated
why
we
think
this
alleged
competitive
restraint
is
not
the
business
of
insurance.
it
doesn't
satisfy
any
of
the
functional
or
analytical
criteria
articulated
in
this
court's
decisions.
moreover,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
challenged
restraint
in
the
chiropractic
market
does
not
satisfy
the
criteria
established
in
either
the
opinion
of
the
majority
or
that
of
the
dissent
in
royal
drug,
this
court's
most
recent
decision
on
the
subject.
now,
in
view
of
the
short
time
available
i
wont
try
to
repeat
that
brief
in
necessarily
abbreviated
form.
instead,
i'd
like
to
address
the
critical
words
"business
of
insurance"
from
a
historical
perspective,
for
after
all
the
various
criteria
articulated
by
the
courts,
whether
it's
spreading
risk
or
relationship
to
the
policy,
are
but
means
to
an
end,
and
that
end
is
of
course
to
ascertain
whether
congress
intended
a
restraint
of
the
type
alleged
here,
namely
in
a
provider
market,
a
non-insurance
market,
to
be
entitled
to
the
exemption
that
it
had
provided
for
the
business
of
insurance.
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
of
course
was
passed
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
southeastern
underwriters,
and
there
is
considerable
evidence
that
congress
was
attempting
to
undo
some,
but
not
all,
of
the
changes
that
that
decision
was
thought
to
have
brought
about.
in
southeastern
underwriters
the
majority
held
that
the
sherman
act
encompassed
alleged
restraints
among
insurers
in
the
writing
of
insurance
policies.
all
the
members
of
the
court
recognized
that
the
interstate
communications
and
transportation
incidental
to
the
writing
of
insurance
policies
were
sufficient
to
fall
within
the
commerce
clause.
but
chief
justice
stone
in
his
dissent
sought
to
distinguish
between
the
local
and
the
interstate
aspects
of
insurance
company
activities,
and
he
referred
to
the
former
as
the
business
of
insurance.
and
in
developing
his
limited
notion
of
the
business
of
insurance
which
should
be
left
to
state
primacy,
the
chief
justice
addressed
the
issue
raised
in
this
case.
and
i
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
570
and
7
of
volume
322,
where
you
will
see
that
the
chief
justice
stated
that
if
contracts
of
insurance
are
in
fact
made
the
instrument
of
restraint
in
the
marketing
of
goods
or
services,
they
are
not
beyond
the
reach
of
the
sherman
act.
contracts
not
in
themselves
in
interstate
commerce
may
nevertheless
be
used
as
the
means
of
its
restraint.
similarly,
justice
jackson
in
his
dissent
expressed
the
view
at
page
587
that
if
competition
in
goods
and
services
other
than
insurance
were
restrained
by
insurance
company
activities
that
conduct
would
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act.
now,
since
the
majority
of
the
court
felt
the
sherman
act
applied
to
the
actual
writing
of
insurance
policies,
it
can
be
assumed
that
they
too
deemed
the
federal
law
applicable
to
restraints
in
non-insurance
markets
effectuated
through
insurance
company
activities.
thus
it
could
be
said
that
the
entire
court
in
southeastern
underwriters
was
of
the
view
that
conduct
involving
an
insurance
company
would
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act
if
it
restrained
competition
in
non-insurance
markets.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
that
was
a
view
held
by
justice
frankfurter,
but
he
joined
the
dissent,
chief
justice
stone,
which
drew
this
distinction
between
insurance
restraints
and
insurance
transactions
which
result
in
a
restraint
in
a
non-insurance
market.
he
joined
that
dissent.
i
think
it
is
a
fair
statement
to
say
that
he
thereby
adopted
the
reasoning.
if
not,
then
one
member
of
the
court
did
not
address
that
issue.
this
unanimity
or
consensus
i
suggest
is
critical
to
ascertaining
what
congress'
intent
was
with
respect
to
non-insurance
restraints
of
the
type
alleged
in
this
case,
for
it
indicates
the
legal
status
quo
ante
to
which
the
drafters
of
the
mccarran
act
looked.
now,
we
all
realize
that
the
legislative
history
reveals
considerable
disagreement
as
to
how
much
of
the
exclusive
power
of
insurance
thought
to
reside
in
the
states
as
a
result
of
paul
v.
virginia
should
be
returned
to
the
states.
now,
it's
clear
that
congress
gave
back
some
of
that
power,
but
not
all.
but
more
important
to
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
language,
the
legislative
reports,
or
the
congressional
debates
to
indicate
any
congressional
intent
to
create
a
broader
exemption
from
federal
antitrust
law
for
insurance-related
activities
than
was
thought
to
exist
prior
to
southeastern
underwriters;
and
that,
since
the
court's
aversion
to
this
distinction
between
insurance
restraints
and
non-insurance
restraints
can
be
presumed
to
have
been
known
to
the
congress,
this
silence
is
extremely
important.
for
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
any
of
the
sources
that
i
have
referred
to
that
congress
desired
to
expand
the
antitrust
primacy
of
the
states
to
include
non-insurance
goods
and
services.
on
the
contrary,
they
used
the
limited
term
"business
of
insurance"
rather
than
some
broader
term,
"business
of
insurers"
or
"conduct,
transactions,
restraints,
related
to
insurance.
"
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
i
believe
that--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
--well,
if
in
fact
this
practice
is
not
the
business
of
insurance,
as
you
may
be
suggesting,
then
it
is
not
entitled
to
an
exemption.
i
think
what
must
be
kept
in
mind
in
this--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
--the
restraint
alleged
here...
and
i
think
that's
what
we
must
focus
on...
is
not
an
essential
element
of
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
what
the
allegation
is
is
that
they
have
used
this
arrangement,
which
if
used
legitimately
might
be
viewed
as
at
least
related
to
claims
adjustment,
but
they
have
abused
it,
because
they've
used
it
to
eliminate
chiropractic
competition.
now,
that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
offense,
and
if
in
fact
the
work
was
all
done
in-house
you
would
have
no
allegation
that
there
was
a
restraint
outside
the
insurance
market.
now,
whether
in
fact
this
complaint
is
true
is
a
completely
separate
issue
from
the
one
before
this
court.
but
we
have
to
take
it
as...
at
least
accept
the
allegation
for
the
purposes
of
this
exemption
question.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
i
don't
want
to
seem
to
avoid
that
question,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
probably
more
relevant
what
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
thought
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act,
because
as
this
court's
decisions
indicated
its
comments
were
very
instrumental
in
bringing
that
about.
and
if
we
look
to
those
suggestions,
the
draft
position
of
the
national
association
at
that
time,
all
of
their--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
--yes.
i'm
talking
about
the
intent
of
congress
at
that
time,
which
is
what
we
are
looking
to.
at
that
time
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
urged
that
an
exemption
be
limited
to
horizontal
activities
among
insurance
companies.
if
one
looks
to
their
recommendations,
and
they
i
think
appear
in
the
royal
drug
decision,
they
talked
about
agreements
between
providers
to
enter
into
joint
programs
of
one
type
or
another...
collection
of
cost
data,
the
adoption
of
rates--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
--well,
that
is
correct.
they
have
now
perhaps
rethought--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
--it's
certainly
possible.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
no.
my
understanding
is
that
the
first
peer
review
relationship
arose
in
around
1945,
but
they
really
did
not
become
a
frequently
used
practice
until
much
later.
and
of
course
what
is
relevant
is
what
the
intention
of
congress
was
in
1945,
not
what
might
be
wise
or
better
practice
in
1982.
