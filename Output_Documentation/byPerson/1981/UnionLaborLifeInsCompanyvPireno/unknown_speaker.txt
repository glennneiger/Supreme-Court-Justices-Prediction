unknown
speaker
what
language
in
the
policy
was
being
interpreted?
unknown
speaker
and
are
those
two
things
precisely
what
the
peer
review
committee's
attention
would
be
addressed
to,
the
question,
were
the
services
necessary;
and
secondly,
were
the
charges
usual
and
customary?
unknown
speaker
but
those...
would
that
aspect
be
the
business
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
are
they
in
effect
appraisers
in
terms
of
the
value
of
the
services?
do
they
function
as
appraisers,
in
other
words?
unknown
speaker
are
arrangements
like
this
common
in
the
industry?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
are
you
relying
on
mccarran-ferguson?
unknown
speaker
and
mccarran-ferguson
says
that
no
state
law
will
be
invalidated
because?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
regulated
in
this
particular
respect?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
regulate
how
the
company
will
interpret
necessary
and
usual
and
customary?
unknown
speaker
do
those
procedures
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
insurance
commissioner
for
approval?
unknown
speaker
are
those
regulations
in
any
way...
can
they
be
read
to
authorize
this
kind
of
peer
review
that
your
client
adopted?
unknown
speaker
they
require
it?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
if
you
did
have
the
expertise
on
your
staff
and
did
this
with
your
own
staff
employees,
there'd
be
no
question
it
would
be
business
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
to
justice
brennan
confuses
me
a
little.
you
mean
there'd
be
a
different
result
of
they
had
a
psychiatrist
and
a
chiropractor
and
a
general
practitioner
of
medicine
on
the
staff,
to
whom
these
matters
were
referred?
then
you'd
have
a
different
result?
unknown
speaker
you
think
they
concede
that
or
that
it'd
be
perfectly
obvious
there
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
unknown
speaker
or
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
i
ask
you,
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
section
2,
section
(a)
of
section
2,
says
that
the
business
of
insurance
shall
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
several
states
which
relate
to
the
regulation
or
taxation
of
such
business.
then
in
(b)
it
says
no
act
of
congress
is
to
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede
any
law.
now,
you're
saying
that
there
is
a
law
in
the
state
that
would
be
superseded
if
the
antitrust
laws
were
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
regulated
insurance
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
despite...
you
don't
even
have
to
show
that
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
impair
the
state
law?
unknown
speaker
have
we
got
cases
here
to
that
effect
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
are
the
conclusions
of
the
peer
review
group
binding
on
the
insurer
or
are
they
merely
advisory?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kennedy,
the
new
york
law
in
this
field
basically
does
not
require
peer
review,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
really
isn't,
the
peer
review
itself,
is
not
supervised,
is
it,
pursuant
to
state
law?
unknown
speaker
it
just...
the
new
york
law
prohibits
unfair
claims
practices?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
the
holding
in
the
royal
drug
case,
which
really
gave
rather
a
restrictive
definition
of
the
business
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
get
some
information
of
that
kind
just
by
paying
claims?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kennedy,
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
even
if
you
are
in
the
business
of
insurance,
even
if
this
is
business
of
insurance,
you're
still
not
regulated
by
new
york
law,
the
other
requirement
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
i
know
you
addressed
this
a
little
earlier,
but
would
you
mind
just
telling
me
what
are
the
statutes
you
rely
on
that
you
are
regulated
in
this
respect?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
does
that
regulate
this
peer
review
procedure?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
after
someone
goes
to
the
complaint
department?
what
does
the...
or
complaint
bureau.
what
does
the
insurance
department
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
do
they
enter
an
order
directing
the
company
to
pay?
unknown
speaker
in
new
york
have
licenses
been
either
cancelled
or
failed
renewal
because
of
the
way
claims
were
handled,
as
has
happened
in
some
states?
i
just
wonder
what
new
york's
is,
since
new
york
is
the
pattern
for
so
much
of
this
legislation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kennedy,
is
your
position...
it
seems
to
me
one
might
draw
a
distinction
between
the
agreement
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
group
of
doctors
to
conduct
a
particular
review
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
agreement
among
the
doctors
on
how
they
would
do
the
job.
do
you
contend
both
of
those
agreements
would
be
within
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
say
for
example
they
agreed
upon
a
schedule
of
these
they
would
consider
reasonable
and
anything
above
it
would
be
considered
unreasonable
or
not
usual
and
customary,
and
they
just
always
processed
them
according
to
that,
and
they
periodically
revised
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
in
other
words,
every
time
the
insurance
company
was
involved
it
would
be
within
the
exemption.
but
i'm
still
not
quite
clear.
what
the
doctors'
activities...
i
mean,
a
general
allegation
of
conspiracy
and
so
forth.
can
the
doctors
come
in
and
get
advantage
of
the
exemption?
that's
what
i'm
not
quite
clear
on.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
a
plaintiff
tends
to
allege
things
in
very
dramatic,
all-encompassing
terms.
and
the
doctors
come
in
and
just
say,
well,
we're...
this
was
conducted
pursuant
to
peer
review
procedures,
we're
therefore
exempt.
would
that
be
a
good
defense?
unknown
speaker
which
the
plaintiff
is
always
going
to
allege,
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kennedy,
exactly
how
is
the
peer
committee
appointed
or
chosen,
the
committee
we're
talking
about
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
know
how
it
is
chosen?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
know
how
the
association
goes
about
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
wondered
if
you
could
tell
us
briefly.
unknown
speaker
they
volunteer.
they're
not
compensated,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
any
staff?
unknown
speaker
and
do
they
have
specialists
who
are
called
in
to
sit
on
particular
cases,
or
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
but
they're
not
experts,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
they're
peers;
they're
not
experts.
unknown
speaker
more
so
than
all
the
other
chiropractors?
unknown
speaker
but
you
keep
emphasizing
the
peer,
which
means
that
they're
the
equals.
so
that's
the
opposite
of
expert.
unknown
speaker
well,
like
the
saying,
they're
all
equals
but
some
are
more
equal
than
the
others.
unknown
speaker
lawyers,
doctors,
psychiatrists.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
your
view
of
the
matter
if
the
people
conducting
the
peer
review
were
employed
by
the
insurer?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
see
as
the
functional
difference
between
the
peer
review
chiropractor
who
is
on
the
outside
and
one
who
is
on
the
staff?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
the
in-house
specialists
be
a
little
more
inclined
to
follow
the
orders
of
his
master?
unknown
speaker
ms.
jenkins,
what
if
instead
of
referring
this
matter
to
a
peer
review
committee
of
chiropractors
the
company
had
referred
it
to
retained
counsel?
would
you
use
the
same
argument,
saying
that
lawyers
are
regulated
by
the
new
york
courts
and
the
state
bar
and
therefore
they're
not
within
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
were
asked
to
construe
a
term
of
the
policy?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
that
might
have
been
within
the
definition
in
sec
versus
national
securities.
do
you
think
royal
drug
narrowed
the
definition
in
national
securities?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
say
that
was
the
only
thing
that
was
going
to--
unknown
speaker
--from
what
you
have
said
and
what
your
friend
has
said,
the
petitioner
could
solve
all
these
problems
by
simply
taking
the
same
chiropractors
who
are
now
being
used
as
peer
review
committees
and
write
them
a
letter
and
say,
we
hereby
appoint
you
on
our
staff,
review
staff,
and
we'll
pay
you
$25
or
$50
or
whatever,
or
pay
them
nothing.
that
would
apparently
solve
the
problem,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
that
isn't
consistent
with
what
you
responded
earlier,
that
if
they
were
in-house
people
there
would
be
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
if
they
took
people
from
new
jersey
and
connecticut,
chiropractors
from
new
jersey
and
connecticut?
they
aren't
competitors,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that...
there
is
a
procedure
in
new
york,
isn't
there,
for
state
authorities
to
review
an
insurance
company's
claims
settlement?
unknown
speaker
may
a
policyholder
complain
and
have
a
hearing
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose...
and
what
does
the
official
do
then,
or
the
official
body
do?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so,
but
what
if
the
official
believes
the
settlement
was
quite
proper?
what
will
he
do?
he'll
just
say,
sorry,
you'll
get
no
relief?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
determines
it
was
not
fairly
paid?
what
can
it
do
about
it?
cancel
a
license
of
the
company
to
do
business?
they
can't
order--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
can't
change
the
amount
that
the
company
is
supposed
to
pay,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
it
may?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
approves
it?
what
if
it
approves
it?
don't
you
think
that
if
the
antitrust
law
came
along
and
upset
that
claim
that
it
would
be
impairing
some
state
procedure
for
the
settlement
of
claims?
unknown
speaker
it
may
not
be
necessary,
but
nevertheless
if
it's
permissible
under
state
law
and
they
use
it
and
the
state
review
committee...
if
there's
a
complaint
and
the
state
officials
say,
why,
this
claim
was
settled
quite
well,
and
then
along
comes
the
antitrust
laws
and--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
an
insurance
commission
received
a
great
many
complaints
about
a
particular
insurer
who
was
deliberately
delaying
payment
of
claims,
and
then
a
study
was
made
and
it
developed
that
the
median
time
for
disposing
of
claims
was,
let
us
say
hypothetically,
three
months,
but
that
this
particular
company
took
12
months.
would
that
be
a
subject
over
which
the
commission
in
new
york
would
have
jurisdiction
to
act?
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
seek
any
redress
from
the
new
york
authorities
at
all?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
if
state
law
required
this
sort
of
a
peer
review
group
that
it
would
be
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws?
unknown
speaker
or
that
it
required
private
insurers
to
have
this
precise
kind
of
peer
review
group,
peer
review
committee.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that
was
justice
frankfurter's
view,
was
it?
didn't
he
think
that
the
congress
in
1890
had
in
mind
the
paul
decision
and
didn't
intend
it
to
reach--
unknown
speaker
--but
would
you
agree
that
insurers
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
engage
in
the
various
components
which
in
and
of
themselves
are
not
the
business
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
the
settlement...
isn't
this
method
of
settling
their
claims
such
a
component?
unknown
speaker
assume
it
is
not
in
itself
the
business
of
insurance,
but
is
it
or
is
it
not
essential,
an
essential
part
of
carrying
on
the
business
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they're
doing
it
the
wrong
way.
they
could
do
it
some
other
way
where
it
might
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
grossman,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
the
commissioners
of
insurance,
the
association
representing
all
of
them
in
every
state,
have
filed
a
brief
in
which
they
take
precisely
a
different,
an
opposite
view
from
that
taken
here
today
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
department
of
justice?
they
disagree
with
you
both
on
whether
or
not
this
is
the
business
of
insurance
and
also
as
to
whether
or
not
the
states
regulate
it.
and
these
are
the
people
responsible
for
the
regulation.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
when
the
mccarran
act
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
you're
saying
is
that
they
disagree
today
with
what
their
predecessors
said
a
good
many
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
possible
that
they
know
more
about
it
today
than
they
did
then?
unknown
speaker
were
there
peer
committees
functioning
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kennedy,
with
respect
to
the
basic
argument
the
solicitor
general
made,
do
you
contend
that
the
mccarran
act
does
create
an
exemption
that
was
broader
than
the
area
that
was
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
before
the
southeastern
underwriters
case
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
meet
his
argument
based
on
the
dissenting
justices
in
southeastern
underwriters?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
apparently
his
argument,
as
i
understood
it,
is
that
the
dissenters
took
the
position
that
if
the
insurance
companies
restrained
a
non-insurance
market,
that
then
the
antitrust
laws
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
a
unilateral
determination
by
the
company
wouldn't
raise
an
antitrust
problem.
but
suppose
all
the
insurance
companies
agreed
on
what
fees
they
would...
what
costs
they
would
reimburse,
and
therefore
had
restrained
competition
in
a
non-insurance
market.
do
you
think
that
would
be
covered?
