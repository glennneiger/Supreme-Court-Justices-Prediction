mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
consolidated
actions
arise
from
a
health
insurance
company's
use
of
peer
review
in
the
state
of
new
york.
specifically
my
client,
union
labor
life
insurance
company,
referred
certain
claims
for
reimbursement
for
chiropractic
treatment
to
a
peer
review
committee
of
the
petitioner
new
york
state
chiropractic
association.
the
referrals
were
necessary
because
the
company
in
its
experience
was
not
familiar
with
the
type
of
treatment
rendered
or
the
medical
necessity
of
that
treatment.
and
since
the
policy
specifically
limits
the
coverage
to
treatment
that
is
medically
necessary
and
fees
which
are
reasonable
and
customary
within
a
particular
community,
it
was
necessary
for
my
client
to
obtain
professional
advice
from
the
peer
review
committee
of
the
chiropractic
association.
now,
these
terms
of
the
policy
which
i
mentioned
are
approved
by
the
superintendent
of
insurance
of
the
state
of
new
york
under
extensive
regulation
of
insurance
in
our
state.
peer
review,
chiropractic
peer
review,
arose
in
the
early
1970's
at
the
time
that
new
york
state
insurance
law
was
amended
to
require
health
insurance
companies
to
provide
to
policyholders
reimbursement
for
chiropractic
treatment
as
well
as
medical
treatment.
and
therefore
it
became
necessary
for
the
companies
to
honor
all
claims
for
chiropractic
treatment
and
to
obtain
the
professional
advice
which
i
had
mentioned.
respondent
alexander
pireno,
a
licensed
chiropractor
in
the
state
of
new
york,
brought
this
action
in
1976
under
the
sherman
act,
alleging
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
in
the
peer
review
arrangement
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
peer
review
committee
of
the
state
chiropractic
association.
after
two
years
of
extensive
discovery
in
the
case,
it
became
obvious
that
the
only
activity
of
the
peer
review
committee
was
advising
the
insurance
company
as
to
whether
the
treatment
rendered
was
medically
necessary
or
as
to
whether
the
fees
charged
were
within
the
range
of
reasonable
and
customary
charges
in
the
particular
community;
and
that
union
labor
life
insurance
company
was
using
that
advice
in
determining
the
amount
of
reimbursement
to
be
provided
to
its
policyholders
in
connection
with
their
claims
for
chiropractic
treatment.
therefore,
it
became
obvious
that
the
pireno
claim
was
simply
that
the
company
was
using
this
advice
to
interpret
its
policy
and
he
was
disputing
the
company's
interpretation
of
the
policy
insofar
as
the
amount
of
benefits
to
be
provided
to
the
insured.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
justice
white,
there
were
specific
terms
in
the
policy
that
limited
the
extent
of
the
coverage.
one
of
the
limitations
was
that
the
treatment
had
to
be
medically
necessary,
and
another
was
that
the
extent
of
reimbursement
would
only
be
for
usual
and
customary
fees
and
charges
and
reasonable
charges
within
the
community.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
those
were
the
usual
questions,
your
honor.
there
were
additional
questions.
for
example,
the
company
does
not
provide
reimbursement
if
the
treatment
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
chiropractor's
license
to
practice.
furthermore,
if
the
treatment
is
the
result
of
a
job-related
accident
or
injury
there
is
no
coverage.
and
sometimes
it
might
be
necessary
for
the
company
to
obtain
professional
advice
in
respect
to
those
matters.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
yes,
your
honor.
as
long
as
it's
the
interpretation
of
the
policy
and
relates
to
the
extent
of
the
insurer's
obligations
to
the
insured,
we
say
it
is
the
business
of
insurance.
now,
we
therefore
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
and
that
motion
was
granted.
the
district
court
held
that,
since
peer
review
served
to
determine
the
precise
extent
of
the
insurance
company's
obligations
to
the
policyholders
and
since
it
determined,
it
helped
to
determine,
the
rights
of
the
insured
under
the
policy,
that
this
was
what
this
court
has
held
the
core
of
the
business
of
insurance.
and
this
court
so
held
that
in
the
national
securities
case
and
in
the
royal
drug
case
decided
in
1979.
the
court
held
also,
the
district
court
held
also
here,
that
this--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there
is
an
analogy
there.
the
appraiser
is
an
expert
in
a
sense
with
respect
to,
say,
automobile
damage
and
the
reasonable
cost
of
getting
that
damage
repaired.
and
so
too
are
the
chiropractors
experts
in
the
field
of
treatment.
and
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
the
insurance
company
to
have
this
medical
expertise
on
its
staff,
and
therefore
it's
necessary
for
them
to
go
to
these
professionals
to
get
this
type
of
professional
input.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
yes,
they
are,
justice
brennan.
i
think
that's
indicated
by
the
number
of
amici
we
have
here.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
mccarran-ferguson
says
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
will
apply
to
the
business
of
insurance...
will
not
apply
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
extent
that
that
business
is
regulated
by
the
state.
and
here's
there's
no
question
that
the
business
is
regulated
by
the
state
very
extensively.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
we
claim
it
is,
justice
white.
the
respondent
and
the
attorney
general
say
that
since
the
state
law
and
regulation
doesn't
mention
peer
review
specifically
that
there
is
no
specific
regulation.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
the
new
york
state
law
requires
the
insurance
commissioner
to
supervise
the
adjustment
of
losses
such
as
these
health
insurance
reimbursement
claims,
and
the
statute
requires
the
insurance
company
to
adopt
standards
providing
for
the
reasonable
and
prompt
resolution
of
these
claims.
and
the
insurance
company
is
required
under
state
law
to
make
prompt
investigation
any
time
they
have
a
question.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
the
insurance
commissioner,
justice
brennan,
oversees
the
process.
he
approves
the
policy
wording.
he
has
adopted
detailed
regulations
covering
adjustment
of
losses
and
he
has
established
a
complaint
bureau
within
the
insurance
department.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
i
think
they
may
be
read
to
require
peer
review.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
because
the...
not
specifically,
it
doesn't
mention
peer
review,
of
course.
but
it
does
require
the
insurance
company
to
make
a
prompt
investigation
and
a
complete
review
and
analysis
of
the
claim,
and
if
the
company
does
not
have
the
expertise
on
its
staff
to
determine--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--i
think
the
respondent
and
the
attorney
general
both
concede
that
fact,
that
if
the
chiropractors
were
on
the
staff
that
there
would
be
no
problem,
because
this
would
be
a
determination
wholly
within
the
company
and
they
would
not
be
going
outside
the
company.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
then
i
think
it's
conceded
by
respondent
and
amici
that
in
those
circumstances
the
exemption
provided
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
would
apply.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--i
don't
want--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--we
contend,
your
honor,
that
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
show
that
the
law
of
the
state
would
be
superseded.
i
think
the
legislative
history
here
and
a
review
of
the
debate
in
congress
will
show
quite
clearly
that
what
both
the
house
and
the
senate
intended
was
that
if
an
insurance...
if
the
state
regulated
the
business
of
insurance
the
antitrust
laws
were
not
to
apply,
period.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
as
long
as
they
regulate
the
particular
activity
involved.
for
example,
where
there's
detailed
regulation
of
claims
adjustment,
as
there
is
in
new
york
state,
then
the
antitrust
laws
should
not
be
imposed
on
top
of
that
type
of
regulation.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
i
think,
your
honor,
you
only
have
to
show
that
there
is
regulation
and
supervision
by
the
insurance
superintendent.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
i
think
in
the...
well,
not
on
the
particular
mccarran-ferguson
act,
i
think,
your
honor.
you
do
have
it
in
other
areas
of
implied
exemption,
which
are
quite
different
than
an
explicit
exemption
that
was
granted
here
by
congress.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
they're
not
binding,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
think
the
department
of
justice,
after
reviewing
the
record
in
this
case,
has
conceded
that
in
their
brief,
that
these
determinations
are
not
binding.
they
are
only
advisory
and
all
the
peer
review
committee
is
doing
is
advising
the
company
with
respect
to
the
limitations
of
the
policy.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
it
does
not
require
it.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
there
is
no
precise
wording
in
the
statute
which
says
peer
review.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
that's
correct.
and
if
a
policyholder
feels
that
he
or
she
is
not
getting
full
reimbursement
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
policy,
then
they
have
the
right
to
complain
to
the
insurance
department,
and
there's
an
elaborate
procedure
for
this.
there's
a
complaint
bureau
in
the
department.
that
was
not
done
here,
apparently,
by
any
of
pireno's
patients.
and
furthermore,
pireno
had
a
remedy
in
that
he
could
have
taken
an
assignment
of
any
of
his
insured
patients'
claims
against
the
company
and
made
a
claim
to
the
insurance
department
under
this
process
that
i
mentioned.
he
apparently
failed
to
do
that.
he
came
forward
with
no
evidence
that
he
had
tried
that.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
royal
drug
case
involved
provider
agreements
and
what
those
provider
agreements
intended
was
a
price-fixing
with
respect
to
goods
to
be
sold
to
policyholders
under
a
separate
arrangement,
entirely
separate
arrangement
with
the
insurance
company.
now,
that's
quite
different
than
here,
where
the
insurance
company
is
only
getting
advice
from
the
peer
review
committee
and
there
is
no
fixing
of
fees.
the
chiropractor
remains
free
to
charge
whatever
the
chiropractor
wishes
to
charge
to
the
policyholder.
dr.
pireno
can...
in
fact,
the
record
here
discloses
that
dr.
pireno
claims
no
loss
of
income
and
no
loss
of
patients
as
a
result
of
peer
review.
the
chiropractor
can
deal
with
the
patient,
charge
whatever
he
would
like
to
change,
and
deal
on
whatever
terms
he
wishes.
that's
quite
different
than
at
royal
drug,
where
the
participating
pharmacy
had
to
charge
a
specific
charge
set
out
in
the
agreement.
there's
no
contract
here
for
the
purchase
of
goods.
and
even
under
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
mccarran-ferguson
we
say
this
should
be
the
business
of
insurance
because
it
involves
the
spreading
of
risk.
as
the
district
court
held
here,
this
process
determines
to
what
extent
the
policyholder
is
going
to
have
to
bear
the
loss,
the
entire
loss,
or
whether
the
insurance
company
is
going
to
take
a
good
part
of
that
loss
or
the
entire
loss.
to
the
extent
the
insurance
company
takes
the
entire
loss,
then
that
risk
and
loss
has
to
be
spread
among
all
policyholders
in
the
form
of
higher
premiums.
furthermore,
peer
review
helps
the
insurance
company
determine
what
are
the
reasonable
and
customary
charges
that
it's
going
to
encounter
in
this
field
of
its
business.
a
good
part
of
underwriting
is
calculating
not
only
the
frequency,
the
number
of
times
you're
going
to
have
a
claim
under
the
policy,
but
also
calculating
the
likely
magnitude
of
those
losses.
and
unless
the
insurance
company
gathers
information,
as
it's
doing
here
through
the
peer
review
committee,
as
to
what
the
likely
fees
to
be
encountered
are,
then
it
has
no
way
of
estimating
the
amount
of
premium
and
rates
that
it
should
charge
and
file
with
the
insurance
department.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
yes,
sir,
yes,
it
does.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
insurance
company
handles
most
of
these
claims
without
consulting
a
peer
review
committee.
they
are
able
to
act
on
their
own
experience.
it's
only
when
they
encounter
the
difficult
claim,
the
unusual
treatment,
the
extensive
amount
of
treatment
that
isn't
normally
experienced,
that
they
go
to
the
peer
review
committee.
and
i
think
that's
conceded
in
the
department
of
justice
brief,
where
they
say
it's
very
rarely
used,
the
peer
review
process.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
briefed
in
both
our
main
brief
and
our
reply
brief.
there
is
a
statute
regulating
extensively
the
claims
adjustment
process,
and
that's
a
law
enacted
not
only
in
new
york
but
most
all
states.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
that
requires
the
insurance
company,
as
i
said
before,
to
make
a
prompt
investigation
of
a
claim
and
to
settle
a
claim
expeditiously
and
fairly.
and
the
insurance
company
therefore
has
to
gather
information
and
has
to
go
to
professionals
where
it
does
not
have
that
information,
and
that's
what
it's
doing
here.
again,
if
the
insurance
company
fails
in
these
obligations
then
it's
subject
to
sanction
by
the
insurance
department,
even
to
the
point
of
losing
its
license.
and
a
policyholder
that
feels
aggrieved
in
any
particular
lack
of
reimbursement
can
go
to
the
insurance
department
complaint
bureau
set
up
for
this
and
make
a
complaint
against
the
company.
as
i
said
before,
the
chiropractor
also
can
go
to
the
insurance
department
simply
by
taking
an
assignment
of
his
insured
patient's
claim
against
the
company.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
not
in
this
record
simply
because
dr.
pireno's
patients
did
not
go
to
the
insurance
department
and
he
didn't
go
himself.
however,
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
happens
is
the
insurance
department
staff
makes
an
investigation,
an
extensive
investigation.
they
contact
the
company,
they
contact
the
doctor,
the
policyholder,
and
they
get
all
the
facts
and
they
make
a
final
determination.
sometimes
these
things
are
done
for
a
matter
of
several
dollars
by
way
of
reimbursement.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
yes.
it's
not
an
order
in
the
sense
of
an
administrative
order.
it's
just
ordinarily
a
letter
sent
to
the
company
saying
that,
you
have
not
complied
with
the
statute
and
the
regulations
in
that
you
didn't
fairly
adjust
this
loss.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
know
of
personal
knowledge.
but
i
know
there
have
been
sanctions
imposed
upon
companies
for
failure
to
adjust
losses
as
required
by
the
statute
and
by
the
superintendent's
regulations.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
we
do,
justice
stevens,
to
a
very
limited
extent
in
the
second
instance,
the
agreement
among
the
doctors.
to
the
extent
that
the
doctors
have
a
procedure
as
to
how
they're
going
to
review
these
claims
and
analyze
them
and
maybe--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--justice
stevens,
the
type
of
review
the
peer
review
committee
is
asked
to
undertake
is
really
not
susceptible
to
a
fee
schedule,
because
it's
not
the
routine
claims.
if
it
were
a
routine
claim
the
insurance
company
could
deal
with
it
through
its
own
experience.
it's
the
unusual,
based
on
the
medical,
particular
medical
condition
of
a
patient
or
complications
which
arose
in
the
course
of
the
treatment.
it's
the
unusual
case
which
is
not
susceptible
to
a
fee
schedule.
but
to
the
extent
they
adopted
guidelines
on
fees
that
they
might
be
asked
to
pass
upon,
so
long
as
they
use
that
only
to
advise
the
insurance
company
and
they
didn't
tell
the
insurance
company
and
the
insurance
company
didn't
agree
that
they
were
going
to
use
those
fees,
as
long
as
the
insurance
company
maintained
its
discretion
to
make
the
determination,
then
we
say
it
is
all
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
if
the
doctors...
the
reason,
of
course--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
doctors
used
the
peer
review
process
to
accomplish
something
that--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--yes.
in
that
case
you
would
have
a
potential
abuse
which
could
result
in
the
loss
of
the
exemption.
i
think
this
happens
in
the
exemption
cases
all
the
time.
it
happened
in
the
labor
cases
cited
by
the
justice
department,
where
the
unions
agreed
with
the
employer
to
certain
conditions
which
were
designed
to
drive
competitors
of
the
employer
out
of
business.
and
this
court
held
there,
in
the
huntington
case,
that
that
was...
that
went
beyond
the
purpose
of
the
exemption
provided
to
the
unions,
and
that
purpose
was
collective
bargaining.
here
the
purpose
is
to
permit
the
states
to
regulate
insurance,
and
to
the
extent
that...
to
regulate
the
business
of
insurance...
and
to
the
extent
that
chiropractors
may
do
something,
for
example
attempt
to
operate
as
a
cartel
or
attempt
to
disseminate
their
decisions
with
respect
to
peer
review,
to
fix
prices
in
the
chiropractic
profession,
in
that
instance
you
go
beyond
the
exemption
and
obviously
it's
going
to
be
lost.
and
there
may
have
to
be
hearings
where
you
have
that
type
of
allegation.
that's
why,
your
honor,
we
went
through
extensive
discovery
in
this
case.
instead
of
simply
moving
on
the
pleadings,
we
went
through
discovery
to
see
if
there
were
that
type
of
evidence.
there
wasn't
that
type
of
evidence.
and
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
of
the
respondent
and
the
amici
on
appeal,
they
talk
about
the
potential
for
abuse
in
this
process.
but
they
don't
cite
anything
from
the
record
to
show
that
there's
any
evidence
of
that
type
of
abuse.
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case
we
say
it's
quite
clear
that
there
is
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
i
believe,
justice
powell,
that
that
is
a
matter
of
the
chiropractors
volunteered
to
serve
on
the
committee.
they're
not
compensated.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
pardon
me?
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
yes,
your
honor.
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
the
members
are...
they
volunteer
to
serve
on
the
committee
and
i
believe
they're
appointed
by
the
officers
of
the
association.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they're
not.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
i
don't
believe
so,
other
than
the
ordinary
staff
of
the
association.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
no,
they
don't,
your
honor.
but
they
have
chiropractors
from
different
communities
in
the
state,
from
different
schools
of
treatment.
that's
been
the
experience
of
my
client
in
using
them.
so
that
they're
prepared
to
answer
a
variety
of
different
questions
with
respect
to
the
treatment
obtained.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
they're
experts
in--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--well,
they're
experts,
justice
marshall,
in
connection
with
chiropractic
treatment,
and
they
are...
there
are
different--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--well,
there
are
different
schools
of
chiropractic
treatment
and
different
methods
of
treatment,
and
some
are
more
experienced
and
skilled
in
those
schools
than
others.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
the
respondent
emphasizes
they're
the
peers,
and
i
suppose
they
are
to
the
extent
that
they're
licensed
chiropractors.
but
some
have
more
expertise
in
certain
areas
than
others.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
as
in
any
other
field,
i
suppose
that's
true.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
last
point
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
of
what
it
said
in
sec
versus
variable
annuity,
that
insurance
is
an
evolving
institution
and
should
not
be
frozen
into
the
concept
that
existed
in
1945.
and
the
naic,
we
contend
what
they're
saying
today
is
not
different
from
what
they
said
in
1945
if
the
complete
legislative
history
is
reviewed.
i'd
like
to
point
out
further
what
justice
brennan
cited
in
his
dissent
in
the
royal
drug
case,
that
congress
considered
a
bill
which
would
have
limited
the
business
of
insurance
only
to
agreements
among...
agreements
between
insurance
companies
and
related
only
to
rate
methods.
that
was
senate
bill
12,
introduced
in
1945.
senator
o'mahoney,
who
advocated
the
position
of
the
justice
department
at
that
time,
said
that
he
sought
vigorously
to
get
that
bill
approved
in
committee
and
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
but
it
was
not
approved.
congress
instead
chose
to
enact
a
broad
exemption
from
the
federal
antitrust
laws
and
that
exemption
is
for
the
business
of
insurance.
and
as
this
court
has
held--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
prior
to
southeastern
underwriters
everyone
had
assumed
that
the
antitrust
laws
didn't
even
apply
to
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
well,
your
honor,
almost
everything
the
insurance
companies
do
affects
the
non-insurance
market.
for
example,
if
my
client
here
made
a
unilateral
determination
that
they
were
only
going
to
allow
$100
as
a
reasonable
fee
for
a
certain
type
of
chiropractic
treatment,
certainly
that
would
have
the
same
restraining
effect
on
chiropractors
charging
their
policyholders
as
is
alleged
in
this
case.
and
if
a
company
does
make
the
determination
as
to
what
that
reasonable
fee
should
be,
but
instead
of
making
an
arbitrary
decision
it
goes
out
and
seeks
professional
advice
as
it's
required
to
do,
to
get
expert
input,
by
the
new
york
insurance
law--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--well,
that's
the
issue
just
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
the
court
held
that
an
intra-industry
horizontal
agreement
was
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
within.
and
indeed,
the
justice
department
has
taken
that
position
in
amicus
briefs
filed
in
the
proctor
case,
i
believe,
and
in
the
quality
auto
body
case
as
well,
that
if
it's
an
agreement
solely
among
insurance
companies
it
is
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
now,
further
i--
mr.
t.
richard
kennedy
--i'd
like
to
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
