ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
claim
for
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
not
only
by
an
insurance
company,
union
labor
life,
but
also
by
a
non-insurance
entity,
a
group
of
health
care
providers,
the
new
york
state
chiropractic
association.
both
union
labor
life
and
the
chiropractic
association
seek
immunity
for
their
conduct,
claiming
that
it
constitutes
the
business
of
insurance
under
section
2(b)
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
our
position
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
that
there
would
probably
not
be
a
violation,
because
it
would
all
be
in
house
and
there
would
not
be
a
conspiracy
among
chiropractors.
as
to
the
mccarran-ferguson
issue,
we
think
that
royal
drug
expresses
three
tests
for
the
business
federal
insurance:
one
is
whether
or
not
risk-spreading
or
underwriting
are
involved;
the
second
is
whether
or
not
the
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
insured
is
involved;
and
the
third
is
whether
or
not
parties
outside
of
the
insurance
industry
are
involved.
now,
if
it
were
an
in-house
chiropractor
it
would
satisfy
the
third
test,
but
not
necessarily
the
first
or
second.
but
what
we--
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
--well,
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
there
would
be
no
conspiracy
if
it
were
an
in-house
employee
of
the
insurance
company.
as
far
as
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
concerned,
i
think
there
probably
is
not
much
of
a
functional
difference
whether
it's
in-house
or
not.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
the
insurance
company
has
access
already
to
all
their
claims
experience
information.
and
as
mr.
kennedy
agreed,
that
kind
of
information
is
already
available
to
them
to
base
their
decisions
on
claims
on.
so
it's
already
done
in-house
to
a
large
extent.
the
peer
review
committee
may
have
interests
adverse
to
the
insurance
company,
but
we
don't
think
they
do
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
it
is
important
to
recognize,
as
this
court
emphasized
in
royal
drug,
that
when
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws
are
sought
they
must
be
narrowly
construed,
and
a
statutory
exemption
should
be
limited
to
the
scope
that
was
clearly
intended
by
congress
and
to
the
market
in
which
congress
intended
to
displace
competition
with
regulation,
here
the
insurance
market.
the
market
in
which
the
chiropractors
compete
is
the
chiropractic
market
and
that
is
where
the
restraint
has
occurred
in
this
case.
the
new
york
state
insurance
supervisor
does
not
regulate
chiropractors.
peer
review
is
not
regulated
by
new
york
state
law.
and
the
new
york
state
insurance
department
would
have
no
power
over
the
kinds
of
restraints
that
are
going
on
here.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
lawyers
are
not
regulated
by
the
new
york
insurance
department
and
therefore
they're
not
within
the
mccarran-ferguson
exemption.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
i
wouldn't...
that
wouldn't
necessarily
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
but
it
certainly
would
not
be
the
business
of
insurance.
otherwise,
everyone
that
an
insurance
company
goes
to
to
seek
any
kind
of
services
in
connection
with
its
business
would
be
exempted
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
it
would
begin
to
affect
many
other
markets
besides
the
insurance
market.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
i
think
royal
drug
emphasizes
an
additional
test
beyond
the
one
in
national
securities
in
that
royal
drug
speaks
about
the
underwriting
and
risk-spreading
element
of
insurance,
which
royal
drug
says
is
an
indispensable
characteristic
of
insurance.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
no.
national
securities
is
part
of
another
test,
which
is
the
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
insured.
in
royal
drug
the
merger
involved
the
relationship
between
the
insurance
company
and
its
stockholders,
rather
than
policyholders.
we
contend
that
the
contract,
the
agreement
to
perform
peer
review
between
the
new
york
state
chiropractic
association
and
the
insurance
company
is
not
a
contract
that
concerns
the
policyholder.
the
policyholder
is
unconcerned
in
the
same
way
it
would
be
with
the
pharmacy
agreements
in
the
royal
drug
case.
the
chiropractor
in
dr.
pireno's
position
is
much
like
a
nonparticipating
pharmacy
in
royal
drug,
and
we
believe
that
that
interpretation
of
the
relationship
between...
the
contract
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured
is
what
governs
in
this
situation.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
your
honor,
no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
because
to
the
extent--
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
--what
i
would
like
to
add...
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
what
i
would
like
to
add
to
that
is,
if
they
were
in-house
people
and
were
no
longer
practicing
chiropractors
who
were
competitors
of
each
other
and
of
the
people
whose
claims
they're
reviewing.
if
they
were
totally
in-house
they
would
no
longer
be
competitors
in
the
chiropractic
market
who
were
setting
fees
for
that
market.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
they
might
be,
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
interstate
movement.
but
no,
they're
not
directly
competitors
in
the
same
extent,
and
there
would
probably
not
be
the
same
type
of
antitrust
violation
of
they
had
not
been
direct
competitors
of
dr.
pireno.
however,
i
still
don't
think
that
it
would
have
been
the
business
of
insurance.
the
legislative
history
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
shows
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
were
the
competition
and
the
stringent
regulation
in
the
insurance
market,
and
it
wished
to
preserve
state
regulation
of
the
insurance
market.
it
was
not
concerned,
congress
was
not
concerned,
with
competition
in
the
markets
in
which
insurers
function
as
buyers.
when
an
insurer
is
dealing
with
providers,
it's
basically
there
as
a
buyer
of
goods
and
services,
just
as
the
blue
shield
plan
in
royal
drug
was
a
purchaser
of
services
from
the
pharmacies.
so
i
believe
that
we
must
look
to
see
whether
the
competition
that's
allegedly
affected
in
the
complaint
is
the
competition
that
was
intended
to
be
displaced
by
regulation
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
we
think
that
there
are...
contend
that
there
are
several
points
on
which
this
case
is
governed
by
and
is
similar
to
royal
drug.
in
the
first
place,
it's
an
agreement
with
providers
by
the
insurance
company
which
the
insurer
enters
into
in
order
to
contain
its
costs,
just
as
the
blue
shield
plan
did
in
royal
drug.
it
might
be
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
companies
to
that
extent,
like
other
arrangements
for
the
purchase
of
goods
and
services,
but
it's
not
the
business
of
insurance.
this
arrangement
does
not
underwrite
or
spread
risks.
the
risks
are
spread
by
the
policy
itself
which
the
insured
purchases
from
the
insurance
company.
but
determinations
later
on
about
what
the
obligation
of
the
insurance
company
is
under
that
policy,
or
actually
advice
regarding
that,
do
not
underwrite
or
spread
the
risks.
this
peer
review
arrangement
does
not
concern
the
policyholder
directly
himself.
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
contract
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
and
it
involves
parties
outside
of
the
insurance
industry
and
outside
of
the
contract
between
the
provider
and...
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
we
also
would
like
to
stress
that
there
are
a
number
of
respects
in
which
the
provider
agreements
here
are
even
less
the
business
of
insurance
than
they
were
in
royal
drug.
in
the
first
place,
royal
drug
concerned
a
blue
shield
plan
whose
policies
themselves
promised
and
provided
the
services
that
were
being
offered,
that
is
a
service
benefit
contract,
whereas
here
only
indemnity
contracts
are
involved,
money
benefits
to
reimburse
the
insured.
the
provider
contracts
in
royal
drug
at
least
contemplated
that
some
kind
of
provider
agreements
would
be
entered
into.
in
fact,
they
were
expressly
requested
by
the
union
management
who
were
involved
in
the
group
contracts
that
blue
shield
offered
that
had
pharmacy
agreements,
whereas
here
the
agreement
with
new
york
state
chiropractic
association
is
neither
necessary
nor
related
to
the
insurer's
efforts
to
satisfy
its
obligations
to
its
policyholders,
because
there
are
other
means
whereby
the
insurer
could
get
the
same
kind
of
advice
and
information.
finally,
in
this
case
the
complaint
alleges
a
conspiracy
among
the
providers
which
arose
outside
of
the
insurance
industry
and
sought
to
affect
a
non-insurance
market,
the
market
for
chiropractic
services.
the
providers
agreed
among
themselves
and
then
persuaded
or
were
joined
voluntarily
by
union
labor
life.
and
we
think
this
makes
this
case
even
less
the
business
of
insurance
than
royal
drug.
with
respect
to
the
state
regulation
issue,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that,
first,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
reach
this
issue
in
order
to
affirm
the
second
circuit,
but
it
has
been
briefed
by
the
parties
and
we
believe
that
new
york
state
does
not
regulate
peer
review
practices
of
chiropractors
at
all,
and
it
does
not
regulate
this
particular
practice
to
the
extent
that
is
required
for
mccarran-ferguson
immunity.
furthermore,
the
first
section
of...
the
first
part
of
section
2(b)
is
particularly
appropriate,
because
there
is
no
law
of
new
york
state
that
would
be
impaired
or
invalidated
or
superseded
if
peer
review
is
simply
made
subject
to
federal
antitrust
laws.
furthermore,
because
the
peer
review
committee--
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
--yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
a
policyholder
may
complain
to
the
insurance
department
about
the
claims
settlement
it
has
received.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
as
mr.
kennedy
says,
it
contacts
the
parties,
the
insurance
company
and
the
doctor
that
provided
the
service.
it
does
not
contact
the
peer
review
committee.
it
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
peer
review
committee
and
would
not
be
able
to
deal
directly
with--
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
--if
the
insurance
department
determines
that
the
claim
was
fairly
paid,
i
imagine
that
that's
what--
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
--it
can...
i
am
sure
it
could
possibly
cancel
the
license
of
the
insurance
company,
or
reprimand
the
insurance
company.
it
could
do
nothing
whatsoever
to
the
chiropractors.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
i
think
it
could
probably
order
a
readjustment,
but
i'm
not
positive
about
that.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
can
or
not.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
because
it's
not
necessary
under
new
york
state
law
that
this
particular
means
be
used.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
it
doesn't
upset
the
insurer's
internal
determinations
on
claims
settlement.
it
just...
and
not
only
that.
i
mean,
it's
not
necessarily...
just
because
an
activity
is
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
is
not
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
it
doesn't
always
mean
that
there's
a
violation.
we
contend
there
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
the
peer
review
process
and
it
has
been
used
to
both
fix
fees
and
to
dictate
what
the
modes,
the
proper
modes
of
practice
are
that
will
receive
the
so-called
seal
of
approval
of
the
chiropractors
association.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
the
commission
would
certainly
have
jurisdiction
to
act
against
the
insurance
company,
yes.
the
insurance
company,
however,
is
not
the
only
defendant
in
this
action,
and
the
real
focus
of
the
complaint
of
respondent
was
on
the
agreement
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
chiropractic
association
and
the
activities
of
the
chiropractic
association
implementing
that
agreement.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
because
dr.
pireno
does
not--
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
--no.
dr.
pireno
does
not
accept
assignments
and
so
he
would
not
be
able
to
directly
approach
the
insurance
department.
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
if
the
state
insurance
law
required
insurance
departments
to
have
peer
review
committees?
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
well,
if
it
were
required
by
state
law--
ms.
susan
m.
jenkins
--then
i
would
imagine
that
it
would
satisfy
certainly
the
extent
of
state
regulation
test
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
it
still
might
not
necessarily
be
the
business
of
insurance.
the
business
of
insurance
might
still
be
regulated
and
not
automatically
satisfy
the
first
test
under
the
mccarran-ferouson
act.
like
agreements
with
respect
to
a
lease
or
office
supplies
or
attorneys'
services
or
investments,
contracting
with
providers
for
peer
review
is
the
business
of
an
insurance
company,
and
the
peer
review
conduct
itself
is
not
even
that;
it's
part
of
the
business
of
chiropractors.
neither
of
these,
of
this
conduct,
fits
the
definition
of
the
business
of
insurance
under
royal
drug
and
the
other
precedents
of
this
court.
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
should
be
construed
narrowly
rather
than
extended
to
give
immunity
to
parties,
conduct,
and
markets
which
congress
never
intended
to
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions?
