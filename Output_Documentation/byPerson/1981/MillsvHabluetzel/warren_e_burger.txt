--
justice
white,
and
thank
you
justice
blackmun.
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
mills
against
habluetzel.
mr.
mankins,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
look
at
our
recent
case,
i
think
under
the
connecticut
you'll
find
that
all
it
does
this
prove
who
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it's
a
negative
test
which
is
only
a
fraction
although
a
large
fraction
with
the
total,
but
it's
nothing
like
a
100%
as
you're
suggesting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
simply
an
incorrect
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
page
6
of
your
brief,
you
have
the
statement,
“blood
test
has
--
is
virtually
can
prove
or
disprove
paternity”
because
it
last
--
that
last
forever.
now,
that's
--
that
first
half
of
that
statement
is
fairly
incorrect,
isn't
it?it
doesn't
prove.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
can
only
improve
in
99%
or
whatever
the
doctor
said.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
statment
would
be
blood
tests
can
disprove
paternity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
bonner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
a
proper
remedy
would
have
been
to
bring
a
new
suit
to
a
year
ago
before
the
four
years
had
elapsed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
they
can
do
it
over
a
span
of
four
years
to
establish
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
paternity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
were
--
but
you
were
referring
to
the
other
consequences,
rights
of
inheritance
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
might
be
worth
to
--
to
you
more
than
the
support.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
are
you
--
are
you
saying
in
your
earlier
remarks
and
--
but
essentially
this
is
not
a
support
case,
this
is
just
another
paternity
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
the
support
is
simply
a
collateral
consequence
of
the
results
of
the
paternity
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

ms.
bonner,
do
you
argued
that
the
four-year
statute
had
run
and
that
he
would
be
barred
if
for
one
reason
or
another
he
went
back,
but
if
he
has
a
pending
case
which
he
surely
has,
under
the
one-year
statute,
do
you
believe
that
the
four-year
statute
has
already
run
on
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
kid
was
brought
within
the
four
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
the
arguments
next
in
foremost
--
