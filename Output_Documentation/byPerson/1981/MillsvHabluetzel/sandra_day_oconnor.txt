mr.
mankins,
would
it
be
your
position
that
a
longer
statute
of
limitations
than
the
one
year
might
be
valid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
bonner,
just
to
clarify
this
a
little
more,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
the
one-year
statute
of
limitations
invalid,
then
the
appellant
would
be
able
to
proceed
to
a
established
paternity
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then,
thereafter,
conceivably
could
seek
support
(voice
overlap)
from
the
father
if
paternity
is
established.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
were
still
asserting
the
one-year
statute
of
limitations
as
a
defense
on
behalf
of
your
client.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
