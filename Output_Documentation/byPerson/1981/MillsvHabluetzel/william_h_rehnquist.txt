justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
i
noticed
in
the
very
short
opinion
of
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
on
page
16
of
the
appendix
beginning
there
that
there's
simply
--
about
one
sentence
is
devoted
to
the
constitutional
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
provision.
they
simply
say,
by
points
of
error
such
and
such
tdhr
asserts
that
section
13.01
of
the
family
code
is
unconstitutional
or
in
the
alternative
that
is
tolled
by
the
reason
of
infancy.
we
have
addressed
these
issues
and
found
them
to
be
meritless
in
the
hernandez
case
above-mentioned.
and
based
on
the
reason
set
forth
in
hernandez,
we
overruled
points
of
error
one
through
three.
they
don't
specify
whether
it's
the
texas
constitution
or
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
hernandez,
they
don't
either,
do
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
only
13.01,
which
is
not
tolled.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell
me
mr.
mankins,
those
statutes
that
you
said
tolled
during
infancy
this
by
legislation.
would
that
include
the
proceedings
brought
by
illegitimates?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
the
limitation
without
tolling
is
limited
to
a
paternity
suit,
is
that
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
--
in
every
other
respect,
there
would
be
tolling
in
favor
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
normal
pattern
in
that
court
in
terms
of
the
time?
do
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
before
they
rise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
in
the
fort
worth
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
is
styled
and
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
the
matter
of
abd,
a
minor
child,
and
one
gets
the
impression
from
reading
it
being
--
being
unfamiliar
with
texas
procedure
the
way
as
i
am,
but
the
texas
department
of
human
resources
was
the
plaintiff.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
is
--
isn't
there
something
of
a
party's
problem
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
your
client,
lois
mae
mills
wasn't
the
party
before
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals,
can
she
then
step
in
and
be
a
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
probably
what
i
don't
understand.
she
was
a
party
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
i
get
the
impression
from
what
you've
said
earlier
that's
any
limitation
short
of
age
18
years
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
just
the
--
this
case
for
illegitimate
children.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
there
can't
be
any
statute
of
limitation,
short
of
age
18?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
a
paternity
issue
with
these
other
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
not
the
difference
that
texas
relies
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
blood
test
is
only
a
negative
test,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mankins,
the
reason
for
your
paternity
suit
i
supposed
is
to
establish
the
base
for
support.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
the
putative
father,
knowing
the
mother
tendered
support
for
18
months
and
then
decided
to
quit.
is
she
out
in
the
code?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
any
event,
you
do
concede
that
the
statute
was
the
texas
legislature's
response
to
gomez
against
perez?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
that
extent
--
it's
a
support
statute
to
that
extent
anyway.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
bonner,
do
you
know
anything
about
that
miller
case
--
it
is
the
situation
challenged
under
the
texas
constitution
as
well
as
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
guess
as
to
why
the
case
is
pending
undecided
that
they're
waiting
for
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
we
could
find
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
--
did
you
say
that
the
--
was
the
judgment
in
the
fort
worth
case
based
on
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
only?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
great
demand
from
maternity
--
maternity
suits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
several
years
ago,
on
the
case
ofd
gomez
against
perez,
we
held
that
once
a
state
posits
a
judicially
enforceable
right
of
children
to
receive
support
payments
from
their
natural
fathers,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
state
from
denying
that
same
right
to
illegitimate
children.
after
our
decision
in
gomez,
taxes
granted
to
illegitimate
children,
their
right
to
support
from
their
natural
fathers
but
provided
that
the
suit
to
enforce
that
right
must
be
brought
within
the
first
year
of
the
child's
life.
suits
initiated
after
the
child
was
one-year-old
were
barred
by
a
statute
of
limitations.
this
case
arose
when
appellant
sued
in
texas
on
behalf
of
her
illegitimate
child
to
obtain
support
from
the
child's
natural
father.
the
texas
court
held
that
the
suit
was
barred
because
the
child
was
more
than
one-year-old
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought.
when
appellant
challenged
the
one
year
limitation
is
unconstitutional,
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
held
that
it
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
was
designed
to
effectuate
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
the
prosecution
of
stale
or
fraudulent
claims.
because
the
one
year
limitation
is
so
short
that
it
effectively
denies
illegitimate
children
the
right
to
obtain
support
from
their
natural
fathers
and
because
there
is
little
or
no
evidence
of
paternity
that
would
be
lost
during
the
child's
first
year
of
life,
we
hold
that
the
one
year
limitation
is
not
substantially
related
to
the
state's
interest
in
the
avoidance
of
stale
or
fraudulent
claim
and
therefore
that
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals.

o'connor

opinion
