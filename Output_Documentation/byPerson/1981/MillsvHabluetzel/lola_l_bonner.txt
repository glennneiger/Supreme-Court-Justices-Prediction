ms.
lola
l.
bonner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellee
in
this
case
did
indeed
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
moot.
at
that
time
--
after
that
time
the
four-year
statute
of
limitation
became
ineffective
on
september
1,
1981
taking
the
position
that
a
child
born
subsequent
to
september
1,
1977.
and
texas
could
probably
file
the
suit
and
texas
would
give
retroactive
effect
to
the
new
statute
which
became
effective
on
september
1,
1981.
that
issue
has
not
been
decided
by
the
texas
courts,
which
is
the
reason
our
appellee
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
moot,
seeking
time
for
the
texas
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
give
retroactivity
to
the
new
four-year
statute.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
it's
true.
why
--
why
litigate
the
one-year
when
you
have
the
four-year
looming
before
you?
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
do.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
not
--
(voice
overlap).
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
not
at
all,
sir,
because
the
child
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
the
child
in
this
case
was
born
in
february
of
1977.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
well,
i
don't
see
that
i
was
--
that
the
appellee
in
this
case
was
in
a
position
to
do
that
because
by
the
time,
our
legislator
promulgated
and
formulated
the
new
four-year
statute.
this
case
had
already
been
refused
and
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
what
--
what
the
appellee
was
attempting
to
do
was
give
the
texas
courts
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
would
apply
a
--
retroactivity
to
the
new
statute
before
we
came
up
here,
because
it
would
appear
to
me
and
i
disagree
with
mr.
mankins
when
he
--
when
he
suggested
that
the
texas
courts
are
not
going
to
give
retroactivity
for
this
reason.
there
are
several
cases
which
referred
to
not
giving
retroactivity
to
the
one
year
statute
which
became
effective
in
our
state
on
september
1,
1975.
the
reason
to
me
is
clear.
that
was
a
substantive
right
which
was
granted
by
the
texas
legislature
for
the
first
time
as
an
avenue
for
establishing
paternity.
now,
appellant
would
had
you
--
have
you
believe
that
article
13.01
of
our
texas
family
code
is
a
support
statute
and
it
is
not.
it
is
a
paternity
statute.
now,
it
is
true
that
it
is
a
predicate
and
avenue
for
an
illegitimate
child
to
establish
paternity
where
upon
then
it
can
establish
support.
it
does
many
other
things.
it
gives
that
illegitimate
child
an
opportunity
to
declare
itself
an
heir
at
law
for
purposes
of
inheritance
from
an
interstate
biological
father.
it
gives
that
illegitimate
child
an
opportunity
to
qualify
for
social
security
benefits
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
the
worker
holding
a
social
security
account
number.
it
likewise,
gives
that
illegitimate
child
an
opportunity
to
establish
paternity
for
the
purpose
of
becoming
entitled
to
workers'
compensation,
to
life
insurance
policies,
and
those
kinds
of
things.
now,
this
avenue
in
texas
was
not
available
to
an
illegitimate
child
until
september
1,
1975.
it
was
this
court's
mandate
in
a
support
case
entitled
gomez
versus
perez.
but
it
goes
far
beyond
enabling
an
illegitimate
child
to
enforce
support.
it
does
other
things.
appellant
takes
the
position.
a
legitimate
child
in
texas
can
support
--
enforce
support
at
any
time
until
it
attains
the
age
of
18
years
under
our
texas
law.
so
can
the
illegitimate
child
if
it
will
take
the
step
to
prove
paternity.
if
the
illegitimate
child
takes
that
step
and
establishes
paternity,
then
it
too
may
enforce
support
until
it
attains
the
age
of
18
years.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
that
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
--
is
correct,
establish
paternity,
which
is
a
necessary
prerequisite
in
illegitimacy.
otherwise,
how
do
you
enforce
support?
do
you
enforce
it
against
all
of
the
men
of
the
world
or
must
you
not
establish?
this
is
the
proper
father,
biological
father
from
whom
i'm
going
to
seek
my
support.
now,
the
texas
legislature
did
not
limit
the
right
of
the
child
to
bring
this
suit
within
the
one
year
period
of
time
to
establish
this
paternity.
it
obviously
gave
the
texas
department
of
human
resources
the
right
it
gave
anyone
who
had
an
interest
in
that
child
the
right
to
bring
the
suit
including
the
father.
now,
in
--
on
september
1,
1975,
we
had
our
first
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
to
establish
paternity?
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
he
may
establish
paternity
voluntarily
by
going
into
court.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
that's
--
that
will,
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
--
but
he
may.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
yes.
he
could
--
he
could
waive
that.
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
incidentally,
i
want
--
i
want
to
touch
on
--
on
this
about
the
blood
test.
now,
i
know
nothing
about
the
blood
test.
all
i
know
is
what
i
read
from
the
opinions
rendered
by
this
court.
but
it's
my
understanding
that
a
blood
test
does
not
show
that
you
are
the
father,
it
simply
shows
that
you
are
not
the
father.
now,
at
that
point,
you
must
proceed
on
other
evidence.
if
the
one-year
statute
is
held
to
be
unconstitutional
by
this
court,
then
we
revert
to
pre-1975
law,
which
is
governed
by
gomez
versus
perez,
and
in
this
--
in
the
case
of
the
state,
the
texas
department
of
human
resources
versus
delley.
that
court
has
held
insofar
as
i
know
or
believe
this
is
the
law,
that
a
pre-1975
child
has
until
four
years
past
attaining
the
age
of
18.
so,
that
a
child
in
texas
should
this
one-year
statute
of
limitations
be
held
unconstitutional
may
wait
until
they
are
21
years,
11
months
old,
and
filed
a
suite
to
establish
paternity.
now,
if
that
blood
test
does
not
show
that
the
alleged
father
is
not
the
father,
then
the
case
proceeds
on
other
evidence.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
understand.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
it
wouldn't
help
any
child
because
his
--
his
right
to
support
has
--
has
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
only
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
only
if
this
court
says
that
that
one-year
statute
of
limitations
which
governed
this
case
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
that
is
correct.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
right.
and
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
did
at
the
trial
level
of
this
case,
yes.
the
trial
of
this
case
was
never
heard
on
the
merits.
paternity
wasn't
even
mentioned.
the
case
was
dismissed
because
it
was
barred
by
statute
of
limitations.
no
trial
on
the
merits
was
held
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
--
which
is
the
reason
i
requested
in
the
texas
court
that
the
style
will
be
changed
to
in
re
abd
in
lieu
of
the
manner
in
which
appeal
was
taken
at
united
states
of
america
because
--
and
counsel
pointed
out
the
fact
that
--
that
these
cases
are
confidential.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
we
have
my
client's
name
all
over
the
pleadings
in
these
cases
which
were
very
public.
there
had
been
articles
in
our
study
concerning
this
very
case
naming
my
client
against
whom
paternity
has
never
been
established.
but
walking
further
in
the
proof
of
these
cases
where
the
blood
test
does
not
show
that
the
father
is
not
the
child.
what
man
has
kept
records
for
21
years
and
eight
months
which
could
possibly
disprove
that
the
mother
of
the
punitive
child
had
access
to
him
or
vice
versa.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
that
is
correct.
but
if
you
had
a
16
year-old,
in
one
of
the
cases
in
which
i'm
presently
involved
we
have
three
year-old
(voice
overlap).
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
that
is
correct.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
absolutely,
absolutely.
now
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
no,
this
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
this
is
a
support
case.
i
am
suggesting
that
article
13.01,
the
statute
being
attacked
is
not
a
support
statute.
it's
a
paternity
statute.
and
our
state
legislator
has
said
“fine,
to
illegitimate
children,
we
will
afford
you
an
opportunity
to
establish
paternity.”
now
once
you
do
that,
you're
entitled
to
support,
inheritance,
social
security
benefits,
workers'
compensation,
and
on
and
on,
which
was
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make.
we
take
the
position
that
the
state
legislator
has
the
right
to
set
a
limit,
a
time
limit
on
the
right
of
the
illegitimate
child
or
its
mother
or
the
tdhr,
or
anyone
else
enlisted
in
the
child
to
--
to
bring
that.
and
obviously,
you're
going
--
you
have
more
than
12
months
anyway.
you
actually
have
21
months.under
our
statute,
they
suit
to
establish
paternity
may
be
filed
before
the
child
is
born.
now,
there
is
a
provision
that
if
that
happens,
then
the
blood
test
for
the
child
should
be
made
after
the
child
is
born.
but
a
woman
is
going
to
know
that
she
is
has
long
so
--
long
before
the
nine-month
period
of
time,
has
expired.
so
in
addition
to
that
nine
months,
then
she
has
the
one
year
period
additionally
because
the
statute
subject
of
this
case
says
that
a
suit
to
establish
paternity
may
be
brought
within
--
must
be
brought
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
the
birth
of
the
child
otherwise
it
is
barred.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
--
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
as
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
think
that's
true.
but
it
does
do
other
things.
it
does
do
other
things.
it
--
it
provides
an
illegitimate
child
an
avenue
and
the
--
in
attempting
to
look
down
the
road
as
to
what
might
happen,
i
would
hate
for
our
state
to
end
up
with
the
situation
where
we
have
discrimination
among
the
class,
that
class
being
known
as
illegitimate.
for
example,
from
and
after
september
1,
1981,
an
illegitimate
child
has
four
years
in
which
to
file
a
suit.
if
this
court
holds
that
texas
did
not
have
the
right
to
set
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
on
--
in
paternity
matters,
holds
it
on
constitutional,
under
the
existing
texas
law,
that
child
will
have
until
four
years
after
it
attains
the
age
of
18.
so,
you
have
one
illegitimate
child
who
has
four
years
to
bring
a
suit
and
you
have
another
illegitimate
child
who
has
until
they're
22
years
of
age
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
yes.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
--
they
do.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
and
at
--
frankly,
anticipated
the
question,
why
do
you
think
the
texas
legislature
said
one
year
at
first
and
now
it
is
saying
four.
and
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
is
that
you
know
the
thinking
minds
of
the
legislatures
better
than
i,
and
we
have
all
seen
in
our
lifetimes
that
when
a
new
act
or
new
law
is
effectuated
or
promulgated
and
enacted,
they
start
off
somewhat
easily
and
then
perhaps
bear
down.
we
see
that
more
frequently,
i
think,
in
the
tax
field
than
we
do
in
--in
fields
of
--
of
like
paternity.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
do.
even
if
--
even
if
our
texas
courts
gave
retroactive
effect
which
i
believe
they
will,
to
the
new
law,
the
new
four-year
statute
that
it
would
cover
children
born
from
and
after
september
1,
1977,
that
this
case
would
at
that
point
be
barred
because
of
the
birth
of
this
child
in
february
of
1977.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
that's
just
now
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
yes
sir.
that's
just
my
opinion.
that
--
that
has
--
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
article
1
of
the
texas
constitution
is
mentioned.
however,
the
case
was
decided
on
discrimination
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
but
not
because
of
illegitimate
children.
that
decision
stated
that
the
paternity
statute
discriminated
because
it
was
a
paternity
suit
and
not
a
maternity.
there
was
no
provision
for
a
maternity
suit.
and
a
consequent
result,
it
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i
would
concur
with
my
opposing
counsel.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
i'm
sure
that
this
court
could.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
yes.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
it
--
it
mentioned
in
the
texas
constitution
but
not
in
--
as
it
related
to
the
discrimination
because
it
was
a
paternity
suit
and
not
a
maternity
suit.
that
went
off
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
lola
l.
bonner
not
to
my
knowledge.
