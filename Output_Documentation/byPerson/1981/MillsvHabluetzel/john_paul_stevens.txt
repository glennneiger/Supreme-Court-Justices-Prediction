mr.
mankins,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
texas
supreme
court
has
now
under
consideration
a
case
involved
in
this
very
statute
in
(voice
overlap)
the
constitutional
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
hasn't
decided
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
waiting
for
this
court
or
should
we
wait
for
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me
whether
there
was
challenge
to
statute,
on
the
texas
constitution
in
that
case
or
is
it
just
a
federal
question
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
the
state
could
rationally
require
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
to
have
a
heavier
burden
of
proof
and
the
plaintiff
in
a
case
establishing
paternity
by
a
legitimate
parent?
in
other
words,
in
the
legitimate
case,
presumably
you
could
say
that
all
he
is
to
do
is
prove
that
--
that
the
--
the
person
who
was
married
to
his
mother
is
--
that
the
male
was
married
to
his
mother
that
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
paternity.
but
in
this
case,
could
the
state
rationally
say
that
in
addition
to
proving
that
the
two
parties
were
living
together
at
the
time
of
birth
or
prior
to
the
birth
that
they
had
certain
other
things
that
had
to
be
proved?
would
that
be
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
supposed
the
answer
that
might
be
that
the
common
experience
teaches
us
is
a
greater
probability
of
accuracy
in
one
situation
than
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
more
false
claims
in
the
illegitimacy
area
than
there
are
in
the
illegitimacy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
we
know
they
happened
in
texas
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
the
question
little
differently.
would
it
be
constitutional
for
the
state
of
texas
to
say
that
in
cases
like
this,
there
must
be
a
blood
test?
the
cases
involving
legitimate
children,
there's
no
need
for
a
blood
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is,
then
there
is
some
difference
in
the
treatment
of
their
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
definitely
a
blood
testing
hasn't
yet,
if
they
ever
can,
evolve
--
the
technology
hasn't
evolved
to
the
point
where
it
can
be
affirmative
on
the
issue
of
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
you
have
seen
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
still
leave
the
--
that
would
still
leave
the
defendants
some
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
the
doctor's
article
about
the
100%
exclusion
rate,
he
didn't
say
that's
true
with
all
cases.
just
there
was
a
particular
case
in
which
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
a
part
from
that
article,
isn't
the
general
understanding
that
the
degree
of
reliability
varies
with
the
various
factor
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
can't
make
the
statement
rely
on
a
--
on
the
one-year
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
the
--
that
defendant
--
the
defendant
has
a
--
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
one-year
statute
and
even
if
it's
repealed,
it
can
rely
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know
but
if
it's
amended
like
it
has
been.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
he
can't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
--
my
question
is
why
hasn't
the
case
moved
when
one-year
statute
is
gone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
but
it's
been
repealed.
i
mean
the
one
has
been
changed
to
four.
justice
john
paul
stevens
once
have
we
decided
on
the
one
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
state
didn't
plead
the
one-year
statute
you
wouldn't
be
barred
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
but
you
can't
--
if
the
state
got
up
and
said
he
waived
the
one-year
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
defendant's
vested
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
--
that's
the
--
and
what
does
he
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
to
make
it
hypothetical,
the
reason
you're
going
to
lose
this
case
is
because
that
one-year
statute.
that's
the
only
reason
you
can't
prove
paternity,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
hypothetical
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
four-year
statute
can't
be
involved
because
you
did
file
within
less
than
four
years,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
when
you
brought
this
proceeding,
it
was
within
four
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
four-year
statute
can't
be
barred
in
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
thing
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
one-year
statute
prevents
you
from
recovering.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
bonner,
you
represent
the
punitive
father,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
waived
that
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
now
contending
that's
an
obstacle
to
your
client
having
the
basic
work
money
are
you
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
don't
you
waive
the
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
filed
suit
less
than
four
years
after
he
was
born.
if
you
waive
--
if
the
one-year
statute
isn't
an
obstacle,
whey
don't
you
just
say,
“let's
go
to
trial.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
would
the
father
sue
in
such
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
doing
or
require
a
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
could
do
it
more
than
one
year
after
the
child
was
born,
couldn't
he?
