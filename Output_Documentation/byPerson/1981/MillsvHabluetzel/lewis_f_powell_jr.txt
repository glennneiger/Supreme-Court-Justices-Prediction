justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
reason
why
they
did
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
no
--

lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
problem
of
proof
with
paternity
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
with
respect
to
a
legitimate
child,
is
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
don't
think
that
that
difference
is
enough
to
justify
a
statute
of
limitations
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
any
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
and
did
you
represent
the
texas
department
of
human
resources
in
the
state
proceedings?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
mr.
mankins,
do
you
also
have
an
argument
that
in
any
event
illegitimates
are
discriminated
only
in
against
--
only
in
paternity
suits?
i
think
you
already
told
me.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
in
every
other
kind
of
suit
where
a
legitimate
may
benefit
from
tolling
and
--
a
minor
benefits
from
tolling
so
also
does
an
illegitimate.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
only
in
this
particular
kind
of
proceeding
that
there's
a
discrimination
against
the
illegitimate.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
it's
a
--
it's
more
than
just
a
discrimination
as
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
within
the
class
of
illegitimates
is
also
a
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
discrimination
you
can
tell.
