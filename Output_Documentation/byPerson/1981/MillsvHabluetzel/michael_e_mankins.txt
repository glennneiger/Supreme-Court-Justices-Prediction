mr.
michael
e.
mankins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
suit
today
is
to
determine
whether
the
state
of
texas
can
prohibit
illegitimate
children
over
the
age
of
one
year
from
seeking
a
determination
of
paternity
and
obtaining
child
support
from
their
natural
fathers.
this
prohibition
is
found
in
section
13.01
of
the
texas
family
code,
which
is
a
one
year
statute
of
limitations,
stated
simply
a
suit
to
establish
the
parent-child
relationship
cannot
be
filed
after
the
child
turns
one
year
old
if
the
child
is
illegitimate.
now,
what
texas
has
done
is
to
establish
two
limitations
periods,
one
of
one
year
for
illegitimate
children
and
one
of
18
years
for
legitimate
children.
there
is
no
limitation
at
all
for
legitimate
children
or
children
born
during
a
marriage,
they
can
file
for
child
support
under
texas
law
at
any
time
until
they
turn
18.
now,
it
is
important
to
note
and
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
13.01
is
the
only
limitation
period
that
applies
for
any
interest
that
a
child
may
have
in
the
state
of
texas
for
any
other
kind
of
lawsuit.
all
other
limitations
involving
an
interest
in
children
are
tolled
either
by
statute
in
texas
or
by
case
law
in
texas.
only
13.01
applies
to
an
interest
that
a
child
might
have.
this
suit
was
originally
filed
by
the
natural
mother
of
the
child,
lois
mae
mills,
and
the
department
of
human
resources
against
the
appellee.
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
archie
burton
duncan,
the
illegitimate
child
who
is
the
subject
of
the
suit
was
approximately
20
months
old.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
case
citing
13.01
on
the
--
at
that
time
respondent's
motion.
the
corpus
christi
court
of
civil
appeals
affirmed
and
did
note
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
allegations
of
the
petitioner
it
--
at
the
court
of
civil
appeals
was
meritless.
the
texas
supreme
court
refused
the
writ
of
error
and
refused
to
hear
the
case
on
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
the
only
thing
you
have
to
look
to
hernandez
itself,
i
think
we
did
quote
some
of
hernandez
in
our
joint
appendix.
they
don't
really
address
it
very
much
at
all.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
okay.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
it
was
argued
at
some
length
or
was
briefed
and
argued
at
some
length
in
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
and
that's
all
the
court
chose
to
say
about
it.
now,
there
has
been
one
change
or
a
major
change
in
this
law
since
this
suit
was
filed
and
since
it
was
determined
in
texas.
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
has
been
changed
now
under
13.01
to
a
four-year
statute
of
limitations.
this
went
into
effect
on
september
1st
of
1981.
it
doesn't
affect
this
case
in
any
way
first
because
texas
has
ruled
that
limitations
are
a
substantial
procedure
and
that
once
limitation
is
run,
it
becomes
a
vested
right
of
the
defendant
to
use
it
as
a
defense
and
secondly
the
child
in
this
suit
was
over
four
years
old
on
september
1st,
1981.
so
even
if
it
could
have
been
used,
the
child
here
could
not
have
used
the
four-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
there's
no
tolling
provision.
the
only
change
in
the
new
statute
is
they
deleted
the
word
one
and
added
the
word
four.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
yes,
it's
article
5535
of
the
texas
revised
civil
statutes
that
toll
all
of
the
limitations
found
in
title
91
of
the
texas
laws.
title
91
has
your
two-year
statute
of
limitations
for
torts,
your
four-year
statute
of
limitations
for
written
contracts,
and
all
of
your
general
land
limitations.
that's
a
5,
a
10,
and
even
a
25-year
statute.
all
of
those
are
tolled
under
5535.
there
are
other
limitations
such
as
found
in
workers'
compensation
cases
and
under
texas
law
and
municipalities
can
--
can
have
limitations
on
suits
against
cities
written
into
the
municipal
code.
those
limitations
have
been
tolled
by
common
law
that
texas
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
for
instance
in
workers'
compensation
cases
where
a
minor
has
a
workers'
compensation
claim
that
the
sixth
month
limitation
there
is
tolled
by
public
because
of
the
past
cases
and
by
public
policy.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
one
year,
if
you
look
at
what
illegitimate
children
can
do
which
is
filed
at
any
time
up
until
they
are
no
longer
minors,
which
is
18
in
texas.
texas
has
done
this
by
making
it
four
years
now.
but
since
there's
no
tolling
provision,
the
difference
between
4
years
and
18
years,
i
still
say
all
of
the
arguments
are
still
the
same
and
--
and
really
feel
that
there's
no
real
difference
since
we
have
a
difference.
texas
can
--
for
children
can
make
any
kind
of
limitation
period
they
want.
the
problem
is,
they've
made
one
for
legitimate
children
and
another
one
for
illegitimate
children.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
the
only
reason
we
have
is
what
the
texas
courts
have
said
and
this
is
the
standard
reasons
that
first-year
law
students
learned
and
also
the
standard
reasons
that's
been
cited
in
other
states
that
have
upheld
this
type
of
limitations
for
illegitimate
children.
that
is
prevention
of
stale
and
fraudulent
claims.
there
--
there
are
no
other
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
--
reasons.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
that's
my
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no.
in
texas,
it
is
presumed
that
the
legitimate
child
is
the
child
of
the
father
or
the
husband
of
the
marriage.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
don't
think
it
is
mainly
because
first,
the
blood
test
evidence
which,
i
think,
just
to
recognize
the
validity
of
which
in
little
v.
streater
in
deciding
june
of
last
year,
plus
the
fact
that
you
got
the
situation
where
--
which
has
happened
in
texas,
where
the
--
under
texas
law,
a
husband,
a
father
of
children
born
during
a
marriage
can
disclaim
paternity
at
any
time
during
a
divorce
proceeding
and
show
through
blood
test
that
he
is
not
in
fact
the
natural
father
of
the
children
or
the
child
of
the
marriage.
under
texas
law,
if
the
child
is
over
one
year
old
and
now
over
four
years
old,
that
child
is
without
a
remedy
to
go
against
his
true
natural
father
and
obtain
child
support.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
illegitimates
on
a
--
on
any
other
type
of
claim,
yes
sir.
if
a
illegitimate
(voice
overlap)
child
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
only
in
paternity
suit
it's
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that
correct.
if
the
illegitimate
child
was
struck
down
by
a
car,
the
two-year
limitation
for
torts
in
texas
would
not
start
running
until
that
child
turned
18.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
yes
your
honor.
the
texas
supreme
court
refused
the
writ,
in
our
case,
then
the
fort
worth
court
of
civil
appeals
ruled
that
13.01
was
in
fact
unconstitutional
did
--
citing
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
u.s.
constitution.
at
that
point,
there
was
a
conflict
between
two
courts
of
civil
appeal
opinions.
one
in
fort
worth,
in
our
case
in
corpus
christi
and
the
court
--
the
texas
supreme
court
did
grant
the
writ
based
on
that
and
did
hear
argument
on
this
case
in
february
of
last
year.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
has
not
decided
the
opinion
the
last
time
i
checked,
which
was
about
a
week
ago.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
i
don't
personally
don't
know.
insiders
have
told
me
that
they're
waiting
on
this
court.
but
whether
that's
correct
or
not,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
normally
they
are
much
quicker
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
they're
determined
generally
much
quicker
than
that.
ninety
days
to
six
months,
i
have
been
told.
i
don't
have
extensive
experience
and
even
the
u.s.,
in
the
texas
supreme
court,
much
quicker.
there
were
cases
i've
had
up
there
have
been
decided
quicker
than
that.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no,
your
honor.
under
a
strange
interpretation
of
the
texas
supreme
court's
rules
on
taking
conflicts,
our
case
even
though
the
fort
worth
case
was
decided
just
shortly
after
our
case
was
decided
and
before
our
case
had
gotten,
we
already
passed
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
corpus
christi,
but
we're
not
had
filed
our
writ
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
but
we
--
we
could
not
claim
conflict
under
the
texas
supreme
court
rules,
the
fort
worth
case
conflicted
with
us
but
since
--
but
our
case
does
not
conflict
with
theirs.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
in
--
in
the
fort
worth
case?
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
do
not
know.
i
do
--
the
only
i
do
know
was
challenged.
i
do
know
it
was
challenged
on
the
u.s.
constitution's
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
the
department
of
human
resources
by
both
federal
law
and
state
law,
they
were
supplying
support.
archie
burton
duncan
and
his
mother
were
receiving
afdc,
$86
a
month
in
the
state
of
texas
and
when
you
receive
afdc
both
by
federal
law
and
--
and
state
law
which
has
enacted,
automatically,
any
rights
to
child
support
are
assigned
by
law
to
the
state.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
and
the
state
must
bring
the
act
--
well,
the
mother
could
theoretically
bring
the
action
by
herself
but
generally
in
a
afdc
case,
it
will
be
the
state
who
will
bring
the
action.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
not
in
this
proceeding.
i
worked
for
the
department
of
human
resources
in
this
area
and
filed
numerous
suits
exactly
like
this.
then
i
switched
jobs
and
went
to
work
for
coastal
bend
legal
services
and
with
an
office
in
sinton
and
i
was
familiar
with
this
case
and
because
the
texas
constitution
prohibits
anyone,
but
the
texas
attorney
general,
from
representing
the
case
on
appeal
--
i
took
over
the
case
on
appeal
for
the
department
of
human
resources.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
it
was
a
party
at
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
she
was
a
party.
in
fact
in
the
original
petition,
both
her
and
the
--
a
child
were
named
as
parties.
these
--
under
texas
law,
these
are
confidential
cases
until
there's
a
final
decree
and
at
the
request
of
either
side
--
and
i
don't
know
who
request
it.
the
--
well
i
believe
it
was
the
appellee
here.
this
case
was
styled
in
the
interest
of
abd.
now,
this
case
is
the
16th
case,
i
believe,
that
this
court
had
heard
--
has
heard
involving
the
rights
of
illegitimate
children
since
1968.
now,
this
court
has,
in
these
cases
has
basically
determined
that
where
a
state
attempts
to
restrict
the
rights
of
illegitimate
children
and
where
these
rights
are
fundamental
personal
rights
then
the
state
must
show
some,
as
this
court
had
said,
significant
interest
or
significant
relationship
to
be
served.
in
other
words,
the
rule
seems
to
be
is
--
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
we're
going
to
look
behind
the
words
and
look
at
the
reality
of
the
situation,
the
reason
being
at
the
state
is
seeking
to
restrict
what
is
fundamental
personal
rights.
clearly
the
determination
of
paternity,
the
establishment
of
paternity,
and
the
obtaining
of
child
support
is
such
a
fundamental
personal
right.
texas
can
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
in
order
to
do
so,
it
must
have
some
awfully
good
reason
for
doing
so.
in
other
words,
we're
not
going
to
let
states
simply
use
any
reason
that
comes
to
mind
and
in
order
foster
a
--
a
classification
or
a
disfavored
class
of
illegitimate
children
and
clearly,
a
very
short
limitation
time
does
not
serve
the
purposes
of
children,
illegitimate
children
and
in
fact
is
--
it
hinders
their
obtaining
child
support
and
getting
their
paternity
determined.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no,
i
don't.
i
think
once
again
texas
can
establish
any
limitation
at
once
for
obtaining
child
support.
i
think
it
could
establish
four
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
it's
the
fact
that
we've
got
two
of
them
here.
that's
the
problem.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
think
as
long
as
its
legitimate
children
have
that
right
until
18,
i
think
illegitimate
children
should
have
that
right.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that
--
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
right.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
--
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
if
--
if
toll
--
if
having
this
limitation
is
important
and
the
department
of
human
resources
v.
chapman,
which
is
the
case
that
--
that
said
this
was
a
valid
law
for
the
reasons
that
we're
going
to
prevent
stale
and
fraudulent
claims,
if
that
was
so
important
a
legit
--
an
interest
that
the
state
needed
to
protect,
the
question
of
course
is,
and
why
isn't
it
important
in
any
other
case?
why
is
preventing
stale
and
fraudulent
claims
so
important
here
when
it's
not
important
in
a
workers'
comp
case?
when
it's
not
important
in
an
automobile
wreck
case
in
effect?
when
it's
not
important
if
illegitimate
has
an
interest
in
land?
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no,
you
don't.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
its
paternity
is
probably
--
paternity
suits
are
probably
better
at
withstanding
time
as
far
as
evidence
is
concerned,
the
stale
evidence
argument
for
restricting
these
cases
because
of
the
availability
of
the
blood
test.
here,
the
blood
test
that's
very
good
evidence
and
it
lasts
as
long
as
you've
got
blood
in
your
veins
and
they
can
do
these
blood
tests
at
any
time.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
it
is
a
negative
test,
but
the
exclusion
rates
are
so
high,
routinely
98
to
99%.
also
according
to
dr.
terasaki
who
is
a
pioneer
in
this,
that
now
100%
exclusion
rates
are
now
possible.
they
are
expensive
but
they
are
possible.
with
that
kind
of
evidence,
the
evidence
itself
in
the
case
doesn't
become
stale.
plus
in
--
in
paternity
cases,
generally
blood
test
evidence
is
the
only
real
objective
evidence
you
ever
had.
the
question
is,
did
the
alleged
father
have
sexual
relations
with
the
natural
mother
nine
months
before
the
birth
of
the
child
and
then
is
he
the
father
of
the
child?
whether
or
not
he
had
sexual
relations
with
the
natural
mother
is
something
only
the
natural
mother
and
the
father
going
to
know
anyway.
so
you
don't
have
any,
as
a
general
rule,
you
don't
have
any
other
witnesses
who
are
--
whose
memories
are
going
to
fade
who
are
--
who
are
going
to
get
lost
and
you're
not
going
to
be
losing
any
sort
of
documentary
evidence.
if
anybody
is
harmed
by
the
passage
of
time,
it
would
be
the
natural
mother
and
the
child
themselves,
but
clearly
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
if
there's
going
to
be
any
evidence
that's
--
that's
lost,
it's
is
going
to
be
their
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
wouldn't
see
--
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be.
clearly,
it
makes
a
better
situation
because
that's
going
to
be
easier
to
prove.
but
to
one
skin
it
would
--
what
interest
would
that
serve
in
having
a
higher
a
burden
of
proof
in
an
illegitimate
case
as
proving
paternity
as
opposed
to
a
case
where
the
father
of
the
illegitimate
child
is
trying
to
disprove
paternity.
seems
to
me
like
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
if
that
could
be
shown,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
i
have
had
simply
never
--
everybody
talks
about
these
fraudulent
claims
as
the
attempt
for
blackmail,
but
with
the
type
of
testing
procedures
we
have
in
blood
test
with
the
other
protections
that
the
alleged
father
has,
the
actual
--
the
actuality
of
fraudulent
claims
is
virtually
nonexistent.
it
does
---
it
really
doesn't
ever
happen.
certainly,
men
deny,
and
the
appellee
here
is
denying
his
father
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
--
yes,
that
would
be
where
my
experience
is
clearly.
now,
it
might
be
happening
somewhere
else,
but
it
is
not
happening
as
ruled
in
texas.
but
once
again
--
and
that's
the
problem
i
have
with
that
kind
of
ruling.
it
puts
some
extra
burden
on
--
on
illegitimates,
which
if
it
could
be
shown,
that
there
was
a
greater
possibility
or
greater
potential
for
these
kind
of
fraudulent
cases,
sure,
they
then
could
require
an
extra
burden
because
then,
the
restriction
on
fraudulent
cases
would
make
some
rational
sense.
but
i
haven't
personally
seen
it,
there's
--
there's
nothing
in
the
case
law
that
indicates
this
is
--
is
the
situation
and
the
type
of
evidence,
once
again
with
blood
test
and
the
protections
that
the
alleged
father
has
in
these
cases,
i
think
prevents
that
from
happening,
certainly
in
texas.
in
texas,
the
venues
in
the
father's
hometown
or
home
county,
if
he
wants
it,
pursue
this
confidential,
under
texas
law
if
the
mother
is
excluded,
the
mother
and
the
natural
child
take
blood
test,
and
the
father
is
excluded
the
suit
is
automatically
dismissed
on
--
on
motion.
the
mother
does
not
have,
the
mother
and
the
child
do
not
have
the
right
to
go
forward
with
evidence
even
--
even
with
an
exclusion
and
try
to
show
that
--
that
the
man
is
the
natural
father.
also,
if
the
mother
and
the
natural
child
under
texas
law
refuse
to
take
the
blood
test,
the
case
is
dismissed
whereas
if
the
alleged
father
refuses,
then
he
can
be
held
in
contempt.
but
that's
all.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
i
think
that
is
the
law
in
texas.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
there
is
some
difference
and
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
that.
i
don't
have
any
problem,
and
that
is
what
13.02(a)
but
have
--
does
require,
it
does
require
to
blood
test,
the
court
--
it
is
in
mandatory
language,
shall
appoint
blood
test
expert
to
make
these
tests.
and
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
that
at
all.
the
--
the
problem
we
have
is,
if
you
have
all
of
those,
if
the
state
recognizes
the
validity
of
blood
test,
recognizes
their
accuracy,
recognizes
the
fact
that
that
if
the
alleged
father
is
--
is
excluded,
the
case
is
dismissed
right
there,
no
trial.
if
they
recognize
all
of
that,
then
why
have
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations?
clearly,
maritarial
suits
are
being
dismissed
that
could
otherwise
be
proved
up.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
contempt,
$500
and
six
months
in
jail
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no.
texas,
13.01
in
fact,
there
is
some
disagreement
on
this
in
texas
but
under
some
of
the
of
the
trial
court
rulings,
there's
no
appellant
ruling
on
this
at
all.
the
fact
is
that
a
refusal
can't
even
be
used
in
evidence.
the
language
is
a
little
obscure
under
the
family
code
but
it
says
something
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
she's
got
real
tough
case.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no,
she
can
go
forward
with
the
law
suit.
she
can
--
she
can
go
ahead.
she
and
the
child
can
go
ahead
and
try
the
case
or
there
just
won't
be
blood
test
evidence.
it
will
be
the
standard
kind
of
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
she
may.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
she
may.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
right.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
right.
but,
the
opposite,
if
the
mother
of
the
child
refuse
to
take
the
blood
test,
the
case
is
dismissed.
so,
you
know,
that's
going
to
put
--
and
where
the
accuracy,
but
that's
going
to
put
a
serious
road
block
in
texas
to
fraudulent
claims.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
once
again
you
were
talking
about
medical
terms
and
if
it's
a
double
negative,
dr.
terasaki
says,
he
can
get
100%
exclusion
rate
now.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
it
means
that
all
possible
non-fathers
would
be
excluded.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
what
i
think.
if
all
other
potential
non-fathers
actually
give
100%
exclusion
rate,
that
means
you
have,
a
100%
inclusion
rate.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
who
could
not
be
a
father,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
i
do
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
dr.
terasaki
made
that
statement
in
one
of
his
articles
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief.
“i
have
never
seen
a
100%
exclusion
rate.
i've
seen
exclusion
rates
over
99.25,
44”
something
like
that.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
had
them
in
our
cases
where
we
have
done
blood
testing.
he
said
that
the
alleged
father
was
not
excluded
and
that
the
probability
of
exclusion
was
that
they
have
excluded
99.25%
or
99.21%
of
all
potential
fathers
based
on
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
it
still
would
leave
the
defendant
and
some
others
and
of
course
that
is
for
him
to
argue
to
the
judge
or
the
jury.
our
position
being
that
he
--
if
we
had
that
kind
of
evidence,
of
course,
you
know,
he
was
having
sexual
relations
and
we
have
this
and
this
is
the
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no.
i
understood
that
the
saying
that
they
could
test
now
for
enough
--
in
fact
genes
on
the
dna
molecule
that
they
could
get
a
100%
exclusion
rate.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
that's
the
way
i
understood.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
he
did
not
go
into
any
details
on
this.
it
is
not
currently
done
in
any
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
it
does
very
--
it
does
very
--
almost
of
them
are
in
the
90%
rate
with
about
25%
now
according
to
some
of
the
experts
we
cited
over
98%.
so
one
in
four
over
98%,
the
rest
of
them
are
probably
over
92%.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
once
again,
this
confusing
in
texas
law.
we
don't
have
an
opinion
from
the
appellate
court
in
texas
as
what
this
means.
the
family
code
says,
if
he
doesn't
take
the
blood
test,
the
fact
that
he
didn't
take
the
blood
test,
the
evidence
can
only
be
introduced
to
show
he's
not
excluded.
some
of
the
trail
court's
rule,
so
that
means
he
--
like
this
moment,
you
can't
say
that
he
didn't
do
it,
but
you
can
argue
that
no
blood
test
had
been
made
and
he
is
not
excluded
under
blood
test.
some
courts
have
--
some
trial
courts
have
said
that
--
that
you
can
open
up
the
whole
thing
to
show
that
you
tried
to
give
him
to
take
blood
test
and
he
refused.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
think
there's
abundant
protection
on
the
father.
well,
certainly
with
13.01,
your
excluding
cases
that
could
otherwise
be
tried.
and
these,
with
no
real
reason,
when
you
look
at
all
the
other
protections
given
to
the
natural
father.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
think
she
would
be
under
texas
law.
there
is
no
opinion
again
in
texas
on
an
estoppel
argument.
the
only
thing
we
have
that's
close
to
it
is
department
of
human
resources
v.
hernandez,
the
companion
case
to
this
case
decided
by
the
corpus
christi
court
of
civil
appeals.
they
--
in
talking
about
totaling
generally
and
about
why
this
case
should
not
be
told,
said
that
well,
if
we
told
if
the
case
limitations
runs
against
the
mother
but
it
didn't
run
against
the
minor
child
and
we're
defeating
the
policy
of
a
limitation
in
paternity
anyway.
implying
that
estoppel
which
would
also
defeat
the
policy
of
a
limitation
in
attorney
would
also
not
apply.
but
texas,
unlike
other
states,
doesn't
have
any
estoppel
clause
in
their
limitation
period.
other
states
which
have
limitation
periods
on
these
type
of
cases
have
in
the
limitation
itself,
the
fact
that
if
the
father
voluntarily
supports
the
child
then
their
limitation
starts
running
after
he
stops
supporting.
texas
doesn't
have
any
of
that
and
we
don't
have
an
opinion
as
to
whether
texas
would
have
that
if
that
was
used
as
a
(voice
overlap)
defense
and
limitation.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
because
four
is
simply
not
for
the
court.
it's
not
in
this
case.
i
simply,
as
my
personal
opinion
(voice
overlap)
--
think
it's
a
one
year
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
because
we
--
we
--
only
the
one
year
applies
to
us.
article
1
section
16
of
texas
constitution
and
the
decisions
by
the
texas
supreme
court
under
that
state
that
when
a
limitation
runs,
it
becomes
the
best
to
defense
of
the
defendant.
it
had
run
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well
--
i
--
my
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
think
all
the
(voice
overlap)
argument
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
the
texas
supreme
court
could
very
well
make
that
determination.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
they
would
have
to
read
the
opinion
and
if
it
was
nearly
written
only
applying
the
one
year.
certainly,
i
think
if
the
one-year
is
unconstitutional,
the
four-year
is
unconstitutional
because
it's
the
same
situation
all
over
again.
why
have
limitation
of
four
years
when
there's
no
other
limitation
involving
the
rights
of
children
or
illegitimate
children
in
any
other
kind
of
lawsuit
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no,
because
it
did,
in
one
law
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
that's
--
that's
one
thing.
it
is
not
before
this
court
at
this
time.
but
my
argument
is
that
--
that
even
though
it's
not
before
the
court,
certainly,
if
the
one-year
unconstitutional
for
all
the
same
reasons,
the
four
years
is
going
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
have
the
four-year
statute
here
when
you
don't
have
a
limitation
for
anybody
else.
and
of
course,
the
evidence
for
four-year
is
just
as
good
36
months
later
as
it
would
be
after
one
year.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
it's
incorrect
and
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
it's
incorrect
in
that
as
you
state
it
does
not
affirm
--
affirmatively
state
who
the
father
is.
but
it
excludes
so
many
people
that
coupled
with
the
other
evidence
that
you
normally
have
in
--
in
any
type
of
lawsuit
makes
a
--
a
very
strong
case.
it's
--
(voice
overlap)
it's
a
type
of
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
blood
test
can
certainly
disprove
paternity
at
anytime.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
that
is
from
a
lawyer
who's
tried
about
60
of
these
and
this
type
of
evidence
is
overwhelming
when
you
get
it
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
for
that
matter.
they're
going
to
look
at
this
and
--
and
really
this
is
very
strong
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
don't
understand
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
no,
if
it's
repealed
then
we
would
go
back
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
he
can't
rely
on
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
because
the
one-year
had
already
run
when
we
filed
the
case
under
texas
law
and
plus
the
child
was
over
four
when
(voice
overlap)
the
four-year
went
to
effect.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
it's
not
gone
in
texas.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
because
texas
court
has
not
ruled
that
it's
unconstitutional
other
than
in
the
--
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
but
there
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
because
all
children
born
after
september
1,
1975
who
are
illegitimate,
and
who
were
not
one-year
old
by
september
1,
1981,
and
who
have
not
had
a
lawsuit
to
determine
paternity
are
still
barred
by
13.01.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
because
13.01
was
the
law
that
was
in
effect
when
they
were
born.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
the
defendant
--
the
defendant,
it's
he's
vested
right
under
the
texas
constitution.
if
--
if
we
have
a
child
that
was
born
in
1977
and
i
go
back
to
san
patricio
county
--
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
defendant's
vested
right.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
he's
the
--
he's
the
alleged
father.
and
if
--
if
we
filed
a
lawsuit
in
san
patricio
county
on
a
child
born
in
1977,
the
one
--
the
defendant
today
can
plead
the
--
our
--
can
plead
the
one-year
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
i
cannot
go
back.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
well,
the
child
was
--
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
mankins
that's
correct.
