justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
say
that
if
the
putative
father
refuses
to
take
the
blood
test,
there's
a
sanction
of
contempt?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
may
also
be
a
finding
of
paternity
against
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
happens
to
the
mother's
paternity
claim
if
a
--
if
a
putative
father
refuses
to
submit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
she
cannot
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
know,
but
if
she
does,
she
may
prevail
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
judgment
of
the
of
paternity
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that's
right.
in
addition
to
the
sanction
or
contempt
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
early
in
your
argument
you
talked
about
the
change
in
the
law.must
we
decide
that
the
one
--
that
the
one
year
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
the
four
or
both?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
is
it
within
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
maybe
so,
what
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
well
therefore
because
of
that
rule,
the
one
year
statute
is
here
supposed
we
said
that
unconstitutional?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
wouldn't
you
have
to
reach
the
four-year
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
the
question
would
be
are
you
barred
by
some
other
rule
and
they
would
say,
“yes,
you're
barred
by
the
four-year
statute”,
and
then
(voice
overlap)
you'd
have
to
reach
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
you
mean
the
texas
supreme
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
--
isn't
there
another
reason
why
the
four-year
statute
isn't
before
us?
the
statute
limitation
is
an
affirmative
defense.
did
your
opponent
plead
the
four-year
statute
limitation
as
a
defense
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
how
can
it
be
before
us?
