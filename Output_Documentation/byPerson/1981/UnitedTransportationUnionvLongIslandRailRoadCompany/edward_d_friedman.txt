mr.
edward
d.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
application
of
the
federal
railway
laws
to
state-owned
and
state-operated
railroads
transporting
a
heavy
volume
of
interstate
freight
and
transporting
as
well
a
heavy
volume
of
passengers,
both
commuter
and
non-commuter.
the
challenged
statute
is
the
railway
labor
act.
the
railway
labor
act,
as
evidenced
by
the
numerous
decisions
in
this
court
involving
it,
is
a
unique
statute
involving
a
unique
industry.
it
was
negotiated
some
55
years
ago
in
conferences
between
the
railroad
industry
and
the
railway
labor
organizations
induced
by
president
coolidge
at
that
time,
and
they
worked
out
in
1926
this
statute
as
the
basis
for
developing
a
special
rule
of
labor
relations
for
the
railroad
industry.
the
date
of
enactment
was
1926.
the
challenging
railroad
is
the
long
island
railroad.
the
long
island
railroad
is
one
of
the
oldest
railroads
in
operation.
it
has
been
subject
to
federal
railway
laws
from
the
very
inception
of
the
earliest
law
in
1887,
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
the
state
of
new
york
by
its
act
of
taking
over
the
business
of
operating
the
long
island
through
stock
purchase
from
the
penn
central
railroad
in
1966
withdrew
the
railroad
from
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause
and
therefore
from
the
reach
of
the
railway
labor
act
under
the
concept
set
down
by
this
court
in
the
national
league
of
cities
v.
usery.
the
district
court
held
that
new
york
did
not
succeed
in
withdrawing
this
railroad
from
the
reaches
of
the
commerce
clause
and
of
the
railway
labor
act,
and
in
so
holding
it
found
that
this
railroad
served
as
a
critical
physical
link
in
the
movement
of
a
heavy
volume
of
interstate
freight
with
other
railroads
via
the
new
york
city
gateway
connecting
long
island
with
the
rest
of
the
united
states.
and
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
case
was
governed
by
california
v.
taylor.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
action
of
the
state
in
operating
the
railroad
was
a
sovereign
act
within
the
national
league
concept.
it
recognized
that
the
long
island
railroad
serves
as
a
crucial
link
in
the
movement
of
interstate
freight.
nonetheless,
it
found
that
the
railroad
served
an
important
function
in
moving
a
heavy
volume
of
commuters
between
new
york
and
long
island,
and
on
this
basis
distinguished
the
california
v.
taylor
case.
now,
when
the
new
york--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--long
island's
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
long
island,
however,
is
a
very
expansive
body
of
real
estate.
it
extends--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--oh,
it's
within
the
state.
this
railroad
operates
within
the
state
of
new
york,
but
it
operates
well
outside
of
the
city
of
new
york.
it
serves
the
entire
area
of
long
island,
which
is
126
miles
long
and
23
miles
wide.
it
services
the
towns
in
long
island.
but
it's
a
freight
railroad
and
it's
a
commuter
railroad.
i'll
get
to
that
in
just
a
second.
the
time
for
purchase,
the
railroad,
as
we
have
noted
in
our
brief,
assured
the
public
and
assured
the
employees
of
the
long
island
railroad
that
all
it
was
doing
was
buying
the
stock,
the
railroad
remained
a
private
corporation,
the
employees
remained
private
employees.
it
said
that
everything
was
the
same;
the
only
thing
that
was
different
was
that
there
was
a
new
set
of
owners
and
a
new
board
of
directors,
but
otherwise
the
operation
of
the
railroad
was
unchanged;
the
same
people
would
be
pounding
the
same
typewriters
and
pulling
the
same
switches,
and
that
the
railroad
employees
would
remain
railroad
employees
subject
to
federal
railway
law,
specifically
the
railway
labor
act.
and
that's
the
way
it
has
been.
now,
this
railroad
is
the
only
common
carrier
by
railroad
serving
long
island,
serving
the
nassau
and
suffolk
county
in
long
island,
the
furthestmost
reaches.
there's
a
map
of
long
island
which
i
attached
to
the
brief
to
the
sense
of
the
relationship
of
the
trackage
in
this
railroad
to
the
trackage
in
new
york
city.
the
railroad
has
something
like
325
miles
of
track
radiating
throughout
the
entire
length
and
width
of
long
island,
serving
the
long
island
towns.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
when
it's
running.
well,
i
understand,
your
honor,
that
they're--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--they're
making
efforts
to
run
it
on
time,
and
i
think
they're
succeeding
fairly
well.
the
railroad
does
connect
with...
its
terminal
is
the
pennsylvania
station
in
new
york
city,
and
it
connects
with
the
pennsylvania
station
over
the
old
penn
central
tracks,
now
the
conrail
tracks,
over
which
it
has
trackage
rights.
so
its
tracks
connect
with
the
conrail
tracks,
and
it
moves
under
the
east
river
conrail
tunnel
and
terminates
in
pennsylvania
station.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
yes.
the
freight
is
unloaded...
it
interchanges
its
interstate
freight
through
conrail
at
long
island
yards
called
fresh
ponds,
long
island.
it's
at
that
point
that
the
railroad
connects
with
the
national
railroads
throughout
the
united
states.
the
interchange
takes
place
at
fresh
ponds.
at
that
point
the
long
island
railroad
will
move
the
freight
cars
to
various
classification
yards
which
it
has
in
long
island
for
eventual
distribution
throughout
the
island.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
well,
on
this
record
the
district
court
found
41,000
freight
cars
for
the
year
1978.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
well,
if
you
look
in
those
yards--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--no...
four
percent
freight?
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
well,
the
figures
that
i
have,
and
the
reports
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
in
this
record,
shows
$20
million
of
freight--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--no.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
well,
i
think
respondent
uses
the
figure
four
percent,
but
in
using
that
figure
he's
using
the
subsidies
which
the
state
receives,
i
believe,
from
the
state
of
new
york.
if
we're
looking
at
revenue,
the
passenger
revenue
on
the
long
island
for
the
year
'78,
which
is
the
year
on
which
this
record
was
based,
was
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
$126
million,
and
the
freight
revenue
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
$20
million,
so
the
ratio
is
about
6
to
1.
although
the
railroad
is
principally
a
commuter
railroad,
it
carries
a
significant
amount
of
interstate
freight.
and
in
the
yards
one
will
see
freight
cars
bearing
the
logos
of
railroads
from
every
corner
of
the
country.
there'll
be
the
southern
pacific,
and
the
burlington,
the
illinois
central,
the
florida
east
coast--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--these
are
long
island
railroad
yards.
there
are
seven
of
them.
and
the
carriage
of
freight
is
a
principal
part
of
its
operation
as
far
as
this
area
is
concerned.
it
carried
2
million
tons
of
freight
in
1978
on
the
41,000
cars.
it
returned
those
cars
either
loaded
into
the
interstate
system
through
conrail
and
spread
throughout
the
united
states
in
the
connecting
carriers,
or
if
it
didn't
have
enough
traffic
to
fill
those
cars,
it
had
to
return
those
cars
unloaded,
and
those
unloaded
cars
would
be
returned
to
the
national
freight
car
pool
in
the
united
states
through
the
interchange
with
conrail.
the
freight
revenue
is
derived
largely
from
divisions,
and
these
divisions
are
shares
of
a
line
haul
rate
charged
by
the
originating
carrier,
which
may
be
the
burlington
coming
out
of
washington,
it
may
be
a
railroad
coming
out
of
the
middle
west.
it
will
be
deriving
its
freight
from
every
part
of
the
country.
now,
its
share
from
the
divisions,
which
is
all
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
was
about
$12
million
in
1978
exclusive
of
surcharges,
and
the
$12
million
represented
about
18
percent
of
the
line
haul
revenue.
the
long
island's
share
was
18
percent.
it
also
added
to
the
divisions
something
called
a
surcharge
under
the
railroad
retirement
act,
and
that
surcharge
was
12
1/2
percent
flat,
which
produced
another
$6
or
$7
million
in
1978.
the
surcharge,
as
the
respondents
point
out
in
their
brief,
were
recently
disallowed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
not
compatible
with
the
standards.
the
case
involving
the
surcharge
was
before
this
court
on
petition
of
the
long
island
railroad
a
few
years
ago
in
a
case
called
long
island
railroad
v.
aberdeen
and
rockfish
railroad
in
which
this
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
with
directions
as
to
the
handling
of
the
refunds
on
the
disallowed
surcharge.
long
island
at
the
time
of
the
surcharge
proceeding
filed
an
application
with
the
icc
for
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
its
divisions;
it
wanted
a
greater
share.
that
was
disallowed.
and
most
recently,
following
the
disallowance,
it
filed
a
new
set
of
surcharges
in
about
the
same
amount
as
the
disallowed
surcharges
of
12
1/2
percent,
and
this
time
its
action
was
taken
under
the
staggers
rail
deregulation
act
of
1981
which
allows
carriers
to
file
surcharges
of
this
nature.
these
surcharges
were
also
challenged
by
the
national
railroad,
and
that
proceeding
is
now
pending
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
in
addition
to
this
activity,
the
railroad
carries...
it
sells
260,000,
on
this
record,
commutation
and
non-commutation
tickets.
of
the
260,000
tickets,
about
90,000
represent
commuters
traveling
to
and
from
long
island
into
new
york.
the
balance
represents
passengers
who
are
buying
fares
at
the
basic
rate.
the
word
"commuter"
is
derived
from
the
word
"commutation"
which
means
to
lower
the
rate
in
a
situation
of
this
kind.
as
i
said,
its
revenues
from
its
passenger
revenues
were
about
$128
million,
and
its
passenger
equipment
is
similar
to
that
used
by
rail
passenger
railroads,
similar
to
that
used
by
amtrak.
the
freight
is
pulled
by
diesels.
the
passengers
are
pulled
by
electric
trains,
by
electric
cars,
and
by
diesels.
now,
the
essence
of
national
league
of
cities
is
that
tenth
amendment
shields
the
state
from
intrusions
into
its
sovereign
affairs
which
threaten
its
continued
existence
as
a
state
within
the
federal
system,
and
this
is
not
such
a
case.
in
california
v.
taylor
on
which
the
district
court
relied
and
which
we
feel
is
the
governing
case,
california
v.
taylor
held
that
when
california
elected
to
take
over
the
business
of
running
a
railroad
serving
the
san
francisco
docks,
it
placed
itself
in
the
position
of
a
railroad
employer
subject
to
the
railroad
laws
like
any
other
railroad
business.
and
we
submit
that
when
the
state
of
new
york
elected
to
take
over
the
business
of
running
the
long
island
railroad
it,
too,
placed
itself
in
the
position
of
penn
central
as
a
private
railroad
subject
to
the
federal
railroad
laws
and--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
that
was
an
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act.
that
arose,
as
i
read
the
record,
in
connection
with
the
new
development
in
which
conrail,
which
has
been
servicing
the
passenger
service
between
new
york
city
and
new
haven,
is
going
to
yield
that
service.
a
new
corporation
has
been
formed
called
the
amtrak
commuter
corporation
which
either
will
take
over
the
service
over
a
state
will
take
over
the
service.
new
york
made
its
position
known
to
the
congress
that
if
the
congress
would
amend
the
railway
labor
act
to
exclude
the
commuter
railroads
altogether,
then
new
york
state
would
be
interested
in
taking
over
the
commuter
service
to
new
haven.
congress
refused
to
amend
the
railway
labor
act
to
exclude
commuter
railroads,
but
it
did
provide
a
new
system
which
extends
this
interminable
process
of
negotiating
under
the
railway
labor
act
which
was
developed
in
1926
by
about
240
days.
now
as
a
matter--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--it
makes
it
interminable,
yes,
your
honor.
well,
it
now
provides
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
must
designate
a
presidential
emergency
board
in
the
railroad
commuter
situation
upon
application--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--the
reference
was
to
any
commuter
railroad--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--no,
your
honor.
it's
a
railroad
which
is
publicly
financed.
i
can
give
that
to
you.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
oh,
yes.
the
long
island
is
clearly
within
it
and
it's
in
consequence
of
the...
i
have
it
here.
it's
at
page
8-a
of
the
blue
brief.
it
applies
to...
"the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
apply
to
any
dispute
subject
to
this
act
between
a
publicly
funded
and
publicly
operated
carrier
providing
rail
commuter
service,
including
amtrak.
"
publicly
funded
and
publicly
operated.
this
railroad--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--there
is
an
explicit
reference.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
no.
the
definition,
which
i
do
not...
the
definition
says,
""commuter
authority"
means
any
state,
local
or
regional
authority,
corporation
or
other
entity
established
for
the
purpose
of
providing
commuter
service,
including
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority,
the
connecticut
department
of
transportation,
the
maryland
department
of
transportation.
"
et
cetera...
pennsylvania,
new
jersey,
massachusetts,
port
authority.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
the
metropolitan
transit
authority.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
mta.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
and
mta
is
a
party
to
this
action.
now,
under
that
statute
the
president
must
appoint
a
presidential
emergency
board.
under
normal
circumstances
in
the
freight
service
there's
a
60-day
moratorium
period
during
which
the
board
operates.
in
the
commuter
service
it's
now
120
days;
the
time
has
been
doubled.
and
if
that
fails
to
produce
an
agreement,
then
the
president
must
appoint
another
emergency
board,
presidential
emergency
board
at
the
request
of
the
parties
or
the
governor,
and
this
presidential
emergency
board
goes
into
something
called
a
last
offer
selection
process
in
which
it
entertains
the
positions
of
the
parties,
and
it
will--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--yes.
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
would
apply
to
prohibit
any
strike
until
such
time
as
the
case
has
been
freed
of
all
of
these
loops
through
which
the
collective
bargaining
goes.
and
there's
one
other
provision
in
that
act
which
is
new.
i
should
say
that
the
railway
labor
act
is
designed
to
avoid
strikes.
its
whole
purpose
was
to
minimize
and
avoid
strikes,
and
it's
been
successful
in
that
regard.
the
amendments
to
the
commuter
act
prohibit
secondary
strikes,
which
is
something
new
in
the
railway
labor
jargon,
if
the
court
remembers
the
secondaries
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case.
but
secondary
strikes,
strikes
by
the
freight
service
cannot
in
any
way
be
extended
to
the
commuter
service;
so
it
ensures
continued
operation
of
the
commuter
service.
if
there's
a
commuter
dispute
it
goes
through
this
interminable
process
plus
240
days.
now,
california
v.
taylor
was
expressly
confirmed
in
national
league
of
cities.
it
was
the
only
example
given
in
footnote
18
of
the
kind
of
an
activity
which
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
traditional;
and
it
was
at
that
time
said
in
explanation
that
the
states
have
never
regarded
the
operation
of
a
railroad
in
interstate
commerce
as
a
traditional
activity,
and
that's
the
case
here.
new
york
has
attested
to
this
fact.
it's
respected,
observed
all
of
the
federal
railway
laws,
including
the
railway
labor
act,
from
the
time
of
its
purchase.
it
questioned
the
railway
labor
act
alone
and
then
only
on
february
8,
1980
in
the
context
of
this
suit.
and
all
of
the
other
railroads
either
owned,
or
operated,
or
subsidized
in
the
commuter
service
or
in
the
freight
service
or
in
the
terminal
service
throughout
the
united
states
owned,
operated
or
subsidized
by
states
regard
those
railroads
as
not
sovereign
activities
but
as
activities
of
railroads
subject
to
railroad
laws.
and
so
it
must
be.
as
justice
rehnquist
noted
in
frye
v.
u.
s,
if
i
may
paraphrase
it,
the
activity
of
a
state
in
running
a
railroad
in
interstate
commerce
is
so
unlike
the
traditional
government
activities
that
it
has
always
been
regarded
as
a
part
of
a
nationwide
railway
system;
and
that's
the
fact
today.
long
island
railroad
is
unique.
it's
the
only
railroad
owned...
it's
the
only
freight-commuter
railroad
owned
and
operated
by
a
state,
carrying
the
amount
of
freight
and
the
amount
of
passengers
which
it
has.
so
we
submit
that
this
case
falls
well
short
of
satisfying
this
court's
test
of
traditionality
as
explicitly
identified
in
footnote
18.
but
even
apart
from
the
foregoing,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
feel
that
the
respondents
have
failed
to
satisfy
any
of
the
tests
of
the
national
league
of
cities;
and
i'd
like
to
refer
explicitly
to
the
intrusion
test,
the
concept
being
that
the
federal
government
may
not
intrude
into
the
sovereign
affairs
of
the
state
by
interfering
or
disrupting
its
processes
in
which
it
functions
as
a
state
within
a
national
system.
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
railway
labor
laws
have
not
intruded
into
the
long
island
railroad.
they
were
in
place
in
1887,
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
earliest
labor
act
was
in
1888.
this
law
was
passed
in
1926.
when
the
state
of
new
york
purchased
the
stock
of
the
long
island
railroad
it
knew
that
this
was
a
railroad.
it
knew
that
the
tradition
in
the
other
cases...
and
this
was
before
u.s.
v.
california,
which
is
a
1936
case...
well,
this
was
after
the
california
case,
and
it
was
after
california
v.
taylor.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
well,
it
didn't.
it
explicitly
announced
at
that
time
that
the
railway
labor
act
would
continue.
it
classified
this
corporation
as
a
private
corporation,
and
it
has
continued,
even
in
this
case
as
the
district
court
points
out,
all
of
the
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
respected.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
two
comments
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions.
i
would
like
to
say
that
new
york
has
been
operating
the
long
island
railroad
for
14
years
and
is
operating
it
today
under
federal
laws,
federal
railway
laws,
interconnecting
with
other
railroads
throughout
the
united
states;
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
its
existence
as
a
state
has
in
any
way
been
threatened
by
this
state
of
affairs.
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
proceedings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
the
freight
surcharge
it
represented
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
its
rate
structure
was
in
line
with
conrail
and
with
other
railroads.
it
also
represented
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
it
had
no
plan
of
any
kind
to
give
up
its
freight
service;
that
if
it
gave
up
its
freight
service,
some
200,000
trucks
would
be
required
to
pick
up
whatever
part
of
its
freight
that
trucks
could
carry.
and
this
railroad
carries
the
freight
of
freight
trains.
it
carries
coal,
and
copper,
foodstuffs,
paper
and
paper
products,
and
the
run
of
freight
activity.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
if
the
trackage
were
reduced?
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
yes.
all
the
indications
in
the
proceedings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
in
statements
by
the
president
of
this
organization
are
that
it
has
every
intention
of
continuing
with
this
service.
it
represented
to
the
commerce
commission,
there
were
suggestions
in
the
record,
that
the
freight
service
may
be
cross-subsidizing
the
passenger
service,
because
if
they
were
to
give
up
the
freight,
a
good
part
of
the
actual
cost
of
operating
the
freight
system
would
still
continue
necessarily
because
they
would
be
operating
the
passenger
system
over
the
same
tracks
and
the
same
facilities.
they
also
represented
or
it
was
also
said
that
the
economy
of
this
whole
region
will
be
affected
adversely
if
they
give
up
freight.
the
long
island
is
now
engaged
in
a
study
to
try
to
determine
whether
there
is
any
cross-subsidization.
the
allocation
of
cost
between
passenger
service
and
freight
service
has
created
a
problem
of
this
kind.
in
response
to
justice
white's
question
on
de
minimis...
if
i
can
call
it
that;
that's
not
raised
by
the
petition...
but
the
fact
is
that
it's
not
de
minimis.
this
railroad
has
$20
million
in
freight.
the
surcharge
has
to
be
counted.
it's
dollars
collected
for
freight
in
order
to
pay
its
expenses.
and
still
today
it
replaced
that
surcharge
with
another
surcharge.
and
it
carries
two
million
tons
of
freight...
hardly
de
minimis...
compared
with--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--i
don't
understand.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
two
percent.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
well,
i
think
the--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--i'm
thinking
that
if
the
decision
is
to
go
that
way,
it
will
be
reversing
california
v.
taylor
and
united
states
v.
california.
i
checked
the
revenue
of
california
v.
taylor,
and
that's
a
terminal
railroad
serving
the
docks
of
new
york,
about
$150,000.
you
can
hardly
compare
it...
this
is
a
connecting
carrier,
not
a
terminal
carrier.
this
carrier
is
an
important
link
in
the
interstate
movement
as
it
affects
this
area
of
long
island.
i
also
must
think
that
the
railroads,
particularly
throughout
the
northeast,
conrail
and
others
are
abandoning
unprofitable
freight
lines
and
the
unprofitable
branch
lines.
and
these
branch
lines
are
the
lifeblood
of
the
little
towns
which
depended
upon
them
more
fundamentally
than
the
90,000
passengers
on
long
island
depended
upon
this.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
no.
i
don't
believe
that
the
national
league
of
cities
touches
this
case,
because
this
is
not
a
traditional--
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
--oh,
yes.
as
i
would
read
the
case
or
understand
it,
it
would
mean
that
they
could
withdraw
from
all
federal
legislation.
mr.
edward
d.
friedman
including
rates.
