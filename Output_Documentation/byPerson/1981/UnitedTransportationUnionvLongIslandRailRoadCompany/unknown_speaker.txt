unknown
speaker
you're
saying
new
york
and
long
island.
isn't
long
island
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
is
texas,
but
it's
still
one
state.
unknown
speaker
when
it's
running.
unknown
speaker
i
used
to
live
up
there.
unknown
speaker
do
they
unload
some
of
the
freight
onto
conrail
trains?
unknown
speaker
how
many
freight
cars
do
they
have?
unknown
speaker
so
far
i've
never
seen
one.
i've
never
seen
one.
unknown
speaker
they
only
did
four
percent
freight.
unknown
speaker
four
percent
of
the
revenue
of
the
long
island
railroad
is
freight.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
where
i
got
the
four
percent.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
read
the
wrong
figure.
unknown
speaker
is
this
the
long
island
railroad's
yard
or
amtrak?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask,
did
congress
recently
amend
some
statute
addressed
expressly
to
this
railroad?
unknown
speaker
what
was
that?
unknown
speaker
it
really
makes
it
interminable.
unknown
speaker
but
what
was
the
explicit
reference
to
this
railroad?
unknown
speaker
but
not
this
one
by
name?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
whatever
the
general
language
is,
the
long
island
falls
within
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
impression
had
been,
as
there
is
here,
an
explicit
reference
to
amtrak
commuter
services
corporation.
unknown
speaker
there
is
to
it,
but
there's
no
comparable
one
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
which
one
is
it
that
operates
the
long
island?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that's
the
reference.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
a
prohibition
in
that
statute
against
striking
while
that
interminable
procedure
goes
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
have
thought
that
unless
it
purchased
it,
the
road
would
continue
to
be
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
unknown
speaker
what
if
none
of
the
statements
had
been
made
your
colleague
alluded
to?
what
if
they
had
simply
purchased
the
stock
and
operated
as
they
have
operated
with
no
public
utterances
about
the
nature
of
the
enterprise?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
way
at
all
that
a
municipal
corporation
could
buy
and
operate
a
railroad
without
being
subject
to
the
federal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
given
your
view
of
the
present
law,
is
there
any
corporate
mechanism
or
any
other
way
of
handling
the
transaction
that
would
take
them
out
from
under
the
rla?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
your
position
if
the
state
had
constituted
the
employees
of
the
railroad
employees
of
the
state,
which
i
understand
did
not
happen
here.
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
railroad
really
is
just
a
commuter
line
and
has
never
been
part
of
the
interstate
system,
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
yes,
they
can...
it
will
not
be
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
question
was
is
there
any
way
that
a
city
can
acquire
a
railroad
without
being
subject.
yes,
there
is.
unknown
speaker
to
be
within
the
reach.
unknown
speaker
and
the
purchase
of
the
state
does
not
change
that.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further
than
that,
do
you?
once
it's
declared
to
be
in
interstate
commerce,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
it
comes
under
the
rla,
and
the
fact
that
a
state
purchased
it
doesn't
change
that
point.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
was
unsuccessful
in
trying
to
get
you
not
to
rely
solely
on
the
league
of
cities.
i
don't
think
you
need
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
where
i
was
trying
to
get.
but
you'd
be
making
the
same
arguments
if
national
league
had
never
been
decided.
unknown
speaker
there
wouldn't
be
a
case
here
except
for
national.
unknown
speaker
you
perhaps
would
be
trying
to
get
us
to
decide
the
issue
the
same
way
it
was
decided
in
the
national
league
of
cities.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
had
not
the
federal
government
been
in
the
business
of
regulating
wages
for
quite
a
while
when
the
national
league
of
cities
case
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
well,
about
40
years
though,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
constitutional
distinction
between
40
years
and
60
years?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
duty
to
arbitrate?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
duty
to
bargain?
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
take
it
about
any
regulation.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
just
not
strike.
it's
right
across
the
board
any
regulation.
unknown
speaker
how
about
safety?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
it's
a
qualitative
rather
than
a
quantitative
weighing
test?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
safety
a
matter
that
traditionally
was
within
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
regulate?
unknown
speaker
a
classic
example
of
traditional
state
regulation?
unknown
speaker
so
safety
ought
to
be...
what
about
rate
regulation,
icc
regulation?
unknown
speaker
how
about
environmental
regulation?
are
they
immune
from
that,
too?
unknown
speaker
well,
also
in
a
way
that's
indistinguishable
from
when
a
private
employer
does
it.
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
strike.
i
agree
with
you
on
the
capital.
only
the
state
can
decide
where
to
puts
it
capital.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
equally
true
if
they
operated
a
spaghetti
factory?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
those
words
describe
the
railroad
business,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
was
my
spaghetti
factory.
unknown
speaker
so
what?
my
spaghetti
factory
is
going
bankrupt?
so
what
on
the
constitutional
point?
unknown
speaker
so
what?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference
whether
it
goes
broke
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
my
spaghetti
factory
is
essential
for
the
jobs
in
that
local
neighborhood
which
is
having
a
very
difficult
economic
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
the
long
island
railroad
a
private--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
just
like
the
spaghetti
factory.
unknown
speaker
just
like
some
spaghetti
factories.
unknown
speaker
do
you
comply
with
all
of
the
federal
regulations
governing
that
railroad?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
follow
all
of
the
interstate
commerce
regulations,
the
federal
ones?
unknown
speaker
well,
name
me
the
federal
rules
and
regulations
that
the
state
does
not
follow.
unknown
speaker
now
would
you
answer
my
question.
which
ones
do
they
fail
or
refuse
to
follow?
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
trying
to
get
an
answer--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
understand
my
question?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
above
the
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
united
states
a
little
sovereign,
too,
a
little
bit?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
that
case
decide
that
the
federal
government
was
not
sovereign?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaden,
i
don't
mean
to
harp
on
this
too
long,
but
i
really
would
like
to
understand
your
theory
on
it.
i
think
you're
arguing,
in
effect,
that
transportation
is
an
essential,
is
essential
for
the
citizens
of
new
york,
and
that
sort
of
lends
substance
to
your
claim.
what
if
you
felt
that
the
provision
of
food
was
essential
as
a
substitute
for
welfare,
that
the
city
felt
it
would
be
much
more
economical
and
more
essential
to
provide
the
food
directly;
hence,
a
spaghetti
factory,
other
food-producing
facilities.
wouldn't
the
argument
apply?
unknown
speaker
but
all
cases.
i
mean
they
never
would
spend
public
money
foolishly.
unknown
speaker
if
they
just
went
into
business
for
profit.
unknown
speaker
there
are
not
many
of
those.
well,
suppose
the
government
took
over
westchester
airport?
then
faa
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
follow
the
safety
regulations
here?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
to.
unknown
speaker
those
you
agree
with,
those
you
agree
with.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
didn't
agree
with
the
faa
regulations?
would
you
just
disobey
them?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
buses
or
cars
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
long
island
railroad
is
not
the
only
means
of
transportation.
unknown
speaker
create
a
great
hardship
for
people
who
rely
on
them.
but
what
about
closing
the
spaghetti
factory
for
people
who
are
hungry
and
need
that
food?
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
my
spaghetti
factory
meets
the
first
two
prongs
of
your
test.
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
bus
and
subway
system
get
into
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
subway
changed
since
i
was
there?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
stop
with
the
elevator
operators?
why
wouldn't
they
be
in
the
same
category?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
elevator
operators
go
into
as
much
interstate
commerce
as
the
new
york
subways.
unknown
speaker
your
opposing
counsel
suggested
that
that
was
a
ratio
of
about
6
to
1
freight
to
passenger.
you
suggest
it's
just
a
three
or
four
percent.
unknown
speaker
is
it
two
different
statistics?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kaden,
if
you
accept
everything
you
say
it
might
be
an
awfully
good
ground
for
construing
the
railway
labor
act
to
cover
this.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
just
the
incidental,
just
an
incidental,
as
you
say.
you
can
ignore
it.
unknown
speaker
so
what
if
there
were
no
freight?
what
if
there
were
no
freight
here?
would
this
be
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
take
what
you
say,
two
percent,
that's
nothing.
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
that
argument
or
not?
unknown
speaker
would
you
present
that
as
an
alternative
ground
to
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect?
unknown
speaker
well,
shouldn't
we
reach
a
statutory
ground
anyway
first
if
we
can,
or
you
certainly
presented
it,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
the
constitutional
problem?
what
about
the
power
of
congress
to
require
you
to
contribute
to
some
kind
of
pension
fund
for
your
employees,
as
an
employer
and
the
employees,
in
a
federally-administered--
unknown
speaker
--well,
forget
them.
just
say
you're
starting
from
scratch.
unknown
speaker
the
answer
would
be
no,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
how
about
social
security
taxes?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
the
same
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
of
course
all
state--
unknown
speaker
--well,
are
these
employees
really
employees
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
they're
on
the
official
roster.
unknown
speaker
which
they
had
been
operating
under
for
how
many
years?
unknown
speaker
so
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
awful.
unknown
speaker
all
of
a
sudden
it
became
horrible.
unknown
speaker
because
you
went
broke.
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
to
take
that
out
of
the
workers.
unknown
speaker
is
its
trackage
such
that
even
if
it
reduced
it
could
never
likely
be
eliminated?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
is
the
trackage
structure,
since
that's
not
in
this
record,
is
it
such
that
it's
going
to
continue
with
this
kind
of
freight--
unknown
speaker
--well,
even
the
national
league
of
cities
argument
includes
the
submission
that
this
is
a
negligible
proportion
of
the
long
island's
gross
revenue.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
i
heard
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
say
that
the
freight
revenue
was
only
a
very
minor
part
of
its--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
thought
that
was
an
important
point
in
making
his
national
league
of
cities
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is,
and
it's
part
of
yours
to
say
that
it's
a
substantial
part.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
to
sustain
the
national
league
of
cities
argument
would
lead
to
say
that
the
state
would
have
the
exclusive
decision
as
to
whether
the
railroad
should
be
abandoned
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
assume
we
affirm,
does
that
mean
that
the
city
would
be
the
exclusive
authority
on
abandonment?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10
o'clock.
