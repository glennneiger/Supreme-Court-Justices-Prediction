mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
has
participated
in
this
case
in
order
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
has
been
called
in
question
in
this
case
as
it
is
applied
to
a
railroad
operated
by
a
state
instrumentality.
the
case,
of
course,
involves
the
application
of
the
court's
decision
in
national
league
of
cities
v.
usery.
it
is
our
basic
submission
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
review
represents
a
substantial
and
unwarranted
alteration
and
extension
of
the
test
enunciated
in
national
league
of
cities
regarding
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunity.
and
we
submit
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
court's
opinion
and
an
examination
of
the
considerations
that
underlie
it
would
lead
the
court
to
conclude,
should
lead
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
in
national
league
of
cities
the
court
held--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--while
those
factors
certainly,
i
think,
strengthen
the
petitioner's
case
here,
we
don't
think
their
absences
would
be
sufficient
to
require
a
different
result
from
that
for
which
we
contend.
there
are
certainly
many
other
indicators
of
the
state's
subjective
intentions
in
this
respect,
and
that
in
itself,
as
i
hope
to
explain,
would
not
be
sufficient.
the
state
chose
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
classify
the
employees
of
this
railroad
as
not
state
employees.
perhaps
that's
a
public
utterance,
but
we
would
submit
it's
an
utterance
of
the
most
fundamental
kind.
if
the
state
had
taken
no
action
at
all,
we
would
think
that
one
would
still
look
to
the
conduct
of
the
other
states
and
the
expectations
of
states
generally,
and
particularly
in
this
area
we
would
look
to
this
court's
decision
in
california
v.
taylor,
which
had
been
decided
nine
years
earlier,
in
which
the
state
must
be
bound
to
have
been
aware
in
taking
over
the
railroad.
it
is
our
submission
that
a
state
could
not
by
its
unilateral
action
in
assuming
a
function
which
has
long
been
subject
to
what
we
contend
is
a
very
core
aspect
of
the
commerce
power,
cannot
remove
that
authority
away
from
congress.
we
see
this
case
as
most
fundamentally
analogous
to
the
court's
decision
in
case
v.
bowles
in
which
this
court
also
took
the
trouble
to
distinguish
rather
than
overrule
in
national
league
of
cities.
the
court
explained
that
the
power
there
involved
the
war
power
which
was
the
basis
on
which
the
court
upheld
the
emergency
price
restrictions.
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
one
of
the
purposes
for
which
the
united
states
and
the
federal
constitution
were
created,
and
that
that
required
that
the
case
be
distinguished.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
it
is
our
position
that
given
the
history
which
we
do
have
that
the
way
that
could
be
accomplished
is
by
amendment
of
the
railway
labor
act
or
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
essentially,
as
long
as
the
railroad
operates
in
interstate
commerce
pursuant
to
the
terms
defined
by
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
is
not
necessarily
true
of
all
commuter
railroads
but
has
been
held
to
be
true
here
and
is
not
challenged
in
this
court
here,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
that
would
be
our
position.
again,
that
is
one
of
the
factors
which
we
feel
tends
to
reveal
the
state's
subjective
intent;
and
there
is
at
least
language
in
the
court's
decision
in
national
league
of
cities
which
looks
to
the
state's
subjective
intent.
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
language
is
the
states
have
not
regarded.
now,
we
see
several
elements
there:
the
intention
of
the
particular
state
involved,
but
more
importantly,
the
intentions
of
the
state
generally.
one
state
with
an
anomalous
pattern
of
behavior
we
think
cannot
change
the
character
of
what
is
essential
to
federal
sovereignty
as
opposed
to
what
is
essential
to
state
sovereignty.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
right.
but
that's
not
a
change.
if
that
were
so,
that
would
already
be--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--yes,
there
is,
if
it
has
chosen
to
acquire
a
railroad
which
is
not
an
interstate
railroad.
we
would
also
submit
that
it
was
quite
obvious
to
the
state
of
new
york
that
this
was
the
character
of
the
railroad
it
was
buying;
and
there
has
been
no
contention
here,
and
i
think
we
would
stoutly
resist
any
contention
that
congress
drew
an
irrational
line
in
defining
as
carriers
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
carriers
which
do
business
in
interstate
commerce.
congress
in
fact
did
not
reach
out
to
the
furthest
recesses
of
its
commerce
power.
we
would
submit
that
it's
likely
that
the
operations
of
an
intrastate
commuter
railroad,
particularly
serving
the
city
of
new
york,
might
be
held
to
sufficiently
affect
commerce--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--yes,
but
congress
did
not
reach
out
that
far.
it
kept
its
elbows
a
little
closer
in
to
its
body,
and
we
think
reasonably
so;
and
the
state
of
new
york
nevertheless
ran
afoul
of
the
line
that
congress
drew
in
defining
those
interstate
railroads,
i.e.,
all
carriers
which
participate
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
because
after
the
decision
in
national
league
of
cities
we
would
be
obliged
to
say
that
it
is
because
of
the
sequence
there
that
is
so,
whereas
if
the
railway
labor
act
were
enacted
in
1981
and
the
long
island
railroad
had
been
a
state
function
like
many
other
states,
had
operated
for
30
or
40
years,
the
answer
might
be
different.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
driving
at,
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
is
stoutly
contended
here
that
national
league
of
cities
is
applicable.
we
resist
that.
and
it
is
the
law
of
court.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
think
that's
a
question
that's
really
inherently
incapable
of
resolution,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
all
due
respect.
i
don't
know
how
to
say
what
we
would
be
arguing.
we
would
argue
for
the
same
result,
i
am
sure.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that
is--
[laughter]
i
think
perhaps
my
brother
mr.
kaden
might
answer
that
better,
but
i
suspect
that
is
right.
in
national
league
of
cities
the
court
held
that
congress...
excuse
me.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes.
complete
with
the
recognition
that
there
are
state
functions
which
are
not
traditional
and
integral
to
state
sovereignty,
as
we
contend
here
is
the
case
with
the
operation
of
the
long
island
railroad.
i'd
like
to
compare
this
case
with
national
league
of
cities
itself
to
point
out
a
few
salient
features
which
we
think
require
distinguishing
that
case
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
the
law
with
which
we
must
contend.
the
statute
at
issue
in
national
league
of
cities
was
a
very
different
statute,
and
the
chronology
was
a
very
different
statute.
it
was
very
different.
and
we
contend
that
those
are
very
important
factors.
in
national
league
of
cities
the
court
was
confronted
with
some
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
those
amendments
eliminated
a
longstanding
immunity
for
state
and
local
government
employees
who
had
been
exempted
from
the
coverage
of
that
act.
the
act
itself
set
rigid
standards,
and
the
court
focused
on
the
rigidity
of
those
standards,
for
the
wages
and
hours
of
employees.
but
as
i
say,
state
and
local
government
employees
were
not
covered.
and
that
was
so
starting
in
1938
when
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
enacted.
congress
reversed
fields
rather
sharply
in
1974,
subjecting
what
this
court
described
as
almost
all
public
employees
employed
by
the
states
or
various
political
subdivisions
to
the
act.
among
the
functions
covered
were
police
protection,
fire
prevention,
public
health,
sanitation,
parks
and
recreation.
and
those
were
activities
which
the
court
described...
and
i
quote
again...
as
"well
within
the
traditional
operations
of
state
and
local
governments.
"
this
case
stands
in
sharp
contrast
to
national
league
of
cities.
the
statute
is
one
of
the
most
narrowly
drawn
instruments
you
could
imagine.
it
applies
to
one
industry,
an
industry
which
the
court
has
described
in
california
v.
taylor
as
a
state
within
a
state,
noting
its
unique
characteristics.
and
of
course,
as
has
been
said,
it
is
in
the
history
which
the
court
singled
out,
characterizing
in
national
league
of
cities
as
one
not
within
the
realm
of
protected
state
sovereignty.
another
factor
which
we
believe
serves
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
national
league
of
cities
is
the
pervasive
and
longstanding
character
of
federal
regulation
of
the
railroads.
it
really
needs
no
citation
to
point
out
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
1887
whose
terms
determine
the
applicability
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
the
seminal
exercise
of
the
federal
commerce
power.
it's
really
the
context
in
which
this
court
has
defined
that
power.
and
the
subject,
of
course,
was
railroads,
and
this
court
has
essentially
invariably
upheld
the
exercise
of
that
power.
there
are
few
areas--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
we
would
make
several
distinctions.
first,
it
is
not
nearly
so
long
as
it
had
been
in
the
business
of
regulating
railroads.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes.
but
the
point
that
we
consider
truly
critical--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
i
would
answer,
but
we
think
what
is
the
clear
way
of
resolving
this
case
which
avoids
some
gray
areas
which
may
exist
is
to
point
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
statute
and
cognate
statutes
had
been
in
effect
long
before
the
state
came
into
the
area.
therefore,
the
state
could
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
freedom
from
the
federal
regulation,
and
it
assumed
whatever
burden
that
regulation
carried.
we,
of
course,
contend
that
was
quite
a
minimal
burden.
in
national
league
of
cities
the
states
unquestionably
got
there
first.
there
is
some
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
exactly
how
long
the
states
had
been
doing
some
of
those
functions,
whether
police
was
a
public
function
in
the
nighttime
or
the
daytime
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
1652
or
1852.
and
we
could
debate
the
historical
points,
but
we
think
it's
simply
unnecessary
to
get
into
those
areas
which
may
have
a
shade
of
gray
because
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
federal
government
pursuant
to
its
core
commerce
power
functions
got
here
a
long
time
before
the
state.
and
although
i
don't
think
it's
necessary,
it
seems
to
me
a
fine
point
is
put
on
the
matter
by
the
fact
that
the
court
had
already
decided
california
v.
taylor
and
had
spoken
as
to
what
happens
in
exactly
this
situation.
there
may
well
be
issues
as
to
how
many
years
is
enough
to
make
something
traditional,
and
i
think
it's
probably
appropriate
to
point
out
that
those
issues
will
not
likely
escape
this
court
even
if
they
escape
decision
here.
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
both
in
respondent's
brief
and
particularly
in
the
briefs
of
some
of
the
amici
curiae
about
mass
transit
generally.
we,
of
course,
have
submitted
in
our
brief
that
these
commuter
railroads,
because
of
their
history
and
physical
nature,
are
distinct
from
mass
transit
generally.
i
don't
know
whether
i
should
telegraph
punches
to
the
justices,
but
the
justices
may
wish
to
note
that
a
district
court
in
texas
has
invalidated
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
applied
to
mass
transit.
the
court's
direct
appeal
jurisdiction
seems
relevant.
the
solicitor
general
has
not
determined
yet
whether
to
file
a
jurisdictional
statement,
but
it
has
in
other
litigation
been
the
government's
position
that
those
are
not
traditional
government
functions.
that
case
will
probably
wend
its
way
here,
and
we
urge,
particularly
because
of
that
fact,
that
there
is
no
reason
to
reach
out
for
those
issues
which
we
think
need
not
be
decided
here.
we
do
stress
that
there
are
facts
in
this
case
which
make
it
susceptible,
we
think,
of
a
uniquely
narrow
resolution.
this
is
apparently
the
only
commuter
railroad
that's
state
owned
and
also
has
a
freight
service.
it's
one
of
two,
possibly
three
commuter
railroads
that
are
operated
by
a
state
entity.
it's
generally
not
a
very
broad
question.
certainly
the
state
showed
by
its
conduct...
that
conduct
offers
exquisite
testimony
as
to
what
the
state's
expectations
were.
we
note
that
the
respondent
has
pointed
out
its
possible
interest
in
operating
some
of
the
conrail
railroads.
of
course,
one
thing
that
should
be
obvious
is
that
some
of
those,
one
of
those
at
least,
runs
over
into
connecticut.
i
gather
that
there's
a
railroad
in
the
chicago
area,
a
commuter
railroad,
that
runs
over
into
indiana.
truly
the
court
will
be
aware
of
the
problems
that
would
be
created
if
those
railroads
were
held
to
be
outside
the
federal
commerce
power.
it
strikes
us
that
these
are
precisely
the
situations
that
the
commerce
power
was
created
to
deal
with.
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
united
states
was
created
and
the
constitution
adopted,
to
eliminate
the
problems
that
might
arise
if
connecticut
attempted
to
apply
one
system
of
labor
relations
and
new
york
another
to
employees
on
a
road
that
runs
from
new
haven
to
new
york.
here
we're
getting
back
to
almost
200-year
old
conceptions
of
internal
trade
barriers.
we
submit
that
all
these
things
which
may
sound
fanciful
illustrate
the
fundamental
commerce
power
question
which
is
entailed
today.
there
are
many
reasons
why
we
believe
the
court
should
not
abandon
the
language
in
national
league
of
cities
which
comes,
as
i
understand
it,
from
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
frye
v.
united
states,
stressing
the
importance
of
traditional
functions.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
essential,
inherent
in
the
constitution
itself.
as
we
read
not
only
national
league
but
tax
immunity
cases,
the
reason
for
this
immunity
is
partly
because
the
states
were
here
before
there
was
a
united
states.
but
of
course,
that
makes
it
perfectly
appropriate
to
look
to
the
functions
which
the
states
did
or
at
least
were
akin
enough
to
those
functions
to
be
regarded
as
within
the
state
sovereignty,
as
distinguished
from
those
functions
which
were
not
at
all
akin
to
state
functions
in
place
in
the
constitutional
period.
we
would
also
note
one
very
practical
factor
touching
on
separation
of
powers
concerns.
we
would
suggest
that
if
respondent's
alternative
test
is
adopted,
congress
would
simply
have
no
way
of
knowing
when
it
enacts
a
statute
which
might
in
the
future
come
to
apply
to
a
state
instrumentality
whether
it
will
remain
constitutional.
to
adopt
the
rule
that
something
merely
deemed
essential
pursuant
to
the
political
process
of
a
state
is
within
the
state
sovereignty,
by
that
reason
alone
statutes
will
become
unconstitutional
or
not
with
shifting
social
and
economic
considerations;
congress
and
the
lower
courts
will
be
left
without
a
compass.
and
it
seems
to
us
inappropriate
to
place
on
congress
by
judicial
decree
what
is
essentially
a
sunset
requirement;
that
congress
be
faced
with
the
requirement
of
going
through
each
of
its
enactments
on
a
periodic
basis
and
determining
whether
or
not
changing
conditions
had
made
them
unconstitutional.
this
might
be
a
desirable
thing
to
do,
but
we
see
nothing
in
the
court's
decisions
or
the
constitution
itself
which
requires
it.
accordingly,
when
a
state
has
entered
into
the
domain
in
which
the
federal
government
has
long
been
supreme,
assuming
a
function
which
is
not
a
traditional
integral
state
function,
we
would
submit
that
the
state
is
not
in
the
position
to
contest
the
operation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
and
that
the
decision
in
national
league
of
cities
simply
has
no
application.
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
