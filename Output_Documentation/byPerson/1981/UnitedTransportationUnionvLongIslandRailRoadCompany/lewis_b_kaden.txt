mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
require
a
state
to
permit
certain
of
its
employees,
employees
involved
in
aspects
of
public
transit,
the
right
to
strike.
this
court
has
determined
that
the
constitution
imposes
an
affirmative
limitation
on
the
exercise
of
the
federal
commerce
power
in
certain
circumstances.
and
we
submit
that
the
facts
of
this
case...
the
fact
of
whether
the
employees
of
this
state
owned
and
operated
railroad
should
have
the
right
to
strike
by
virtue
of
federal
mandate...
fits
easily
within
the
critical
parameters
of
the
immunity
guaranteed
by
national
league
of
cities.
those
parameters
are
two:
first,
whether
the
nature
of
the
decision
is
such,
the
choice
made
the
state
is
such
that
it
touches
so
closely
on
the
essence
of
sovereignty
as
to
quality
for
immunity.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
we
believe
that
if
the
federal
government
prescribed
that
the
state
must
submit
its
disputes
to
arbitration,
it
would
be
just
as
intrusive
as
prescribing
for
the
state--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--and
the
same
would
be
true
in
the
duty
to
bargain.
the
essence
of--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--that's
right.
the
essence
of
sovereignty
is
the
displacement
of
the
state's
choice,
if
that
choice
is
in
an
area
that
indisputably
affects
an
attribute
of
sovereignty.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
it's
the
structure
of
employment
relations.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
safety
may
be
of
a
different
order.
there
may
be
matters...
and
i
think
this
is
indicated,
for
example,
in
justice
blackmun's
concurrence
in
national
league
of
cities
and
is
picked
up
in
the
restatement
of
the
national
league
of
cities
test
in
the
surface
mining
case
last
term.
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
after
a
service
provided
by
the
state
qualifies
for
this
immunity
from
federal
regulation
there
is
yet
another
test
to
apply:
whether
the
federal
interest
is
so
great
as
to
override
that
immunity.
that
is
not,
in
my
judgment,
a
balancing
test.
that
is
not
looking
at
the
weight
of
the
federal
interest
on
one
side
and
the
state
interest
on
the
other.
it
is
rather
looking
at
whether
the
state
has
qualified
for
the
immunity
and
then
asking
the
further
question
whether
the
federal
interest
is
so
great
as
to
deprive
the
state
of
the
immunity.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
it's
a
test
that
qualifies
the
immunity.
after
the
state
has
qualified
for
the
immunity,
then
there's
a
further
question
to
ask
whether
in
this
particular
case
the
nature
of
the
decision
is
such
that
the
federal
interest
supersedes
the
state
immunity.
that
would
be
true,
i
would
submit,
for
example,
in
the
55-mile
an
hour
regulation
that
was
discussed
yesterday
or
in
certain
safety
or
environmental
regulations
such
as--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--safety
is
indeed
within
the--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--exactly.
and
that
may
be
sufficient
to
qualify
it
for
the
immunity.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
rate
regulation
as
it
affects
freight
traffic
we
concede
is
subject
to
the
federal
power.
freight
traffic
affecting
or
in
interstate
commerce
is
not
the
subject
of
our
claim
to
immunity,
but
rather
commuter
transit
which
is
inextricably
tied
to
the
provision
of
transit
services
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
new
york.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
there
may
well
be
environmental
regulations
in
which
the
state
loses
its
immunity
because
of
the
need
for
uniformity
and
because,
i
suggest,
that
in
certain
circumstances
the
nature
of
the
actor
does
not
matter.
when
the
state
structures
employment
conditions,
it
is
acting
at
the
heart
of
its
sovereign
power.
on
the
other
hand,
as
you
indicated,
justice
stevens,
in
your
separate
opinion
in
national
league
of
cities,
when
the
governor's
limousine
drives
on
the
roads,
or
when
the
state
dumps
its
refuse,
or
when
the
capitol
janitor
burns
coal
in
the
furnace,
he's
performing
an
activity
that
is
indistinguishable
from
the
kind
of
activity
performed
by
private
actors
subject
to
the
commerce
power.
and
it
does
no
damage
to
the
state
sovereignty
to
say
that
the
same
regulatory
standard
will
apply
to
him
when
he's
engaged
in
those
activities.
by
contrast,
when
the
state
chooses
a
location
for
its
state
capital,
the
subject
of
coyle
v.
oklahoma,
or
when
the
state
chooses
whether
to
permit
its
employees
to
strike
or
not,
then
it's
acting
in
a
way
that
touches
the
heart
of
sovereign
power.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
it
is
at
the
essence
of
sovereignty
to
have
a
state
capital.
it
is
not
just--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--and
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
right
to
strike
it's
also
the
essence
of
the
sovereign
decision
for
this
reason.
when
a
state
chooses
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
as
opposed
to
a
private
company,
what
the
state
is
choosing
to
do
is
to
describe
a
method
of
sharing
its
governmental
responsibility.
it
is
saying
to
other
interest
groups
you
petition
the
legislature
to
get
your
share
of
state
resources,
your
share
of
the
pie,
but
it's
saying
to
employees
you
have
a
special
method
of
participating
in
decisions
affecting
you
that
the
government's
going
to
make.
that's
what
gives
rise
to
the
longstanding
debate
about
whether
collective
bargaining
in
government
is
an
undue
delegation
of
governmental
authority.
most
states,
including
new
york,
have
concluded
that
it's
not
an
undue
delegation.
but
it's
the
state's
choice
to
make,
we
submit,
because
it's
so
fundamental
a
choice
in
terms
of
the
exercise
of
state
sovereignty.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
not
necessarily?
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
the
state
goes
into
a
business.
when
the
state
is
engaged
in
an
enterprise,
as,
for
example,
the
state
of
south
dakota
is
in
the
cement
business
that
was
at
issue
in
reeves
v.
stake,
or
even
when
the
state
goes
into
the
business
of
subsidizing
some
private
activity,
then
the
state
is
entering
the
marketplace.
it's
entering
an
activity
in
which
it
interrelates,
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
city
of
lafayette,
with
private--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--no,
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
describe
this
railroad
for
this
reason.
the
railroad's
past
may
well
have
been
that
it
was
part
of
the
world
of
railroading;
it
was
part
of
the
interstate
system
of
railroads.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
but
that's
not
its
present.
the
state
entered
this
railroad
business
because
if
it
didn't
enter
it,
the
railroad
was
bankrupt
and
would
be
abandoned.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
exactly.
let
me
take
first--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--the
question
of
so
what
in
terms
of
the
constitution.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
because
the
state
made
a
judgment,
a
judgment,
as
i
say,
at
the
heart
of
its
sovereign
power,
that
the
provision
of
public
transit
service
to
this
260,000
passengers
a
day
was
essential
to
the
social
and
economic
well-being
of
the
metropolitan
new
york
area,
and
that's
what
separates
it
from
the
spaghetti
factory.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
don't
think
that
the
employment
possibilities
provided
by
a
private
business
enterprise
are
sufficiently
at
the
heart
of
the
exercise
of
sovereign
power
to
qualify
in
the
way
i
described.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
it
was
a
private
railroad
until
1966.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
at
that
time--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--at
that
time
it
was
a
bankrupt
private
railroad--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--exactly.
and
the
state
was
faced
with
the
choice
whether
to
take
that
railroad
over
and
operate
it
or
to
let
it
be
abandoned.
today
that
railroad
operates
under
state
control
with
an
operating
ratio
of
227
percent,
and
i
submit
that
we
don't
have,
even
in
these
troubled
economic
times,
you
can't
run
a
business
with
an
operating
ratio
of
227
percent.
it
runs
because
it's
a
vital
and
essential
public
service.
and
it
runs,
in
addition,
under
the
supervision
of
a
state
agency
that
has
the
responsibility
for--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--excuse
me,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
the
state
with
respect
to
its
freight
traffic
follows
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
statutes.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
the
state
takes
the
position
in
this
case
that
it
is
immune
from
those
federal
regulations
affecting
employment
conditions
on
its
passenger
railroads.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
we
take
the
position
that
with
this
court's
permission,
if
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed,
we
will
not--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--we
will
not--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--yes,
i
do.
we
will
not
be
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act,
we
will
not
be
subject
to
the
railroad
retirement
act,
we
will
not
be
subject
to
other
regulations
of
the
employment
relationship.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
we
are
not.
the
state
of
new
york
as
a
sovereign
government
under
the
national
league
of
cities
decision--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--i
submit
that
really
was
the
issue
in
national
league
of
cities.
the
congress--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--no,
not
at
all.
it
decided
that
the
states
had
an
immunity
from
the
exercise
of
certain
federal
powers,
in
that
case
the
federal
power
to
prescribe
minimum
wages
and
maximum
hours
for
certain
categories
of
state
employees.
and
the
question
before
the
court
here
is
simply
whether
this
service,
transit
service
provided
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
new
york
through
the
long
island
railroad
qualifies
or
not.
on
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
qualifies,
whether
the
structuring
of
employment
conditions
qualifies,
i
would
submit
that
that
really
has
been
decided.
indeed,
solicitor
general
bork
in
the
oral
argument
in
national
league
of
cities
conceded
in
a
response
to
a
question
that
congress
lacked
the
power
to
authorize
state
employees
to
strike.
it
was
not
a
question
that
was
directed
specifically
to
any
particular
service.
so
the
question
really
comes
down
to
whether
this
service
qualifies,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
problem
before
the
court
is
a
problem--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--let
me
suggest
the
standard
that
resolves
the
question,
because
these
problems
of
which
services
qualify
and
which
do
not
have
obviously
troubled
the
lower
federal
courts
since
national
league
of
cities
was
decided.
i
suggest
that
the
standard
is
threefold.
one,
does
the
service
engaged
in
by
the
state
at
the
time
the
case
arises
provide
a
collective
benefit,
a
public
benefit.
in
most
cases
it
will.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
the
state
might
well
go
into
a
business
enterprise
that
doesn't
involve
the
expenditure
of
public
funds
but
instead
involves
some
potential
gain,
and
that
may
not
satisfy
the
collective
benefits
then.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
exactly.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no.
the
federal
safety
regulations
applying
to
aircraft
would
still
apply.
the
question
of
whether
the
state
employees--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--yes,
we
do,
and
we
would--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--no.
as
i
indicated
before
in
response
to
justice
stevens,
we
would
continue
to
follow
those
safety
regulations
for
which
the
test
of
uniformity
requires
a
response.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no.
we
would
challenge
them
as
we've
challenged
the
application
of
the
railway
labor
act.
let
me
try
to
describe
the
standard
that
separates
in
my
judgment
qualifying
services
from
non-qualifying
services.
the
first
is
collective
benefit.
in
most
cases
that
would
be
satisfied.
the
second
is
public
dependent,
is
this
a
service
upon
which
the
public
depends.
and
the
third
and
most
important,
is
this
a
service
that
is
available
to
the
public
to
satisfy
that
need
elsewhere.
and
it's
the
third
that
separates
out,
in
my
judgment,
the
california
belt
railroad,
the
terminal
railway
in
alabama--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--we
do,
indeed.
the
buses
for
the
most
part
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority
and
are
subject,
we
submit,
to
the
same
standards
as
this
case.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
but
the
abandonment
of
public
transit
in
the
long
island
or
in
the
metropolitan
new
york
areas--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--i
think
that
transit
is...
there
may
be
circumstances.
i'm
suggesting
that
this
test
provides
a
vehicle,
a
standard
by
which
to
evaluate
the
services
that
the
state
chooses
to
engage
in
and
for
which
it
claims
immunity
from
time
to
time
as
social
needs
change.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
meets
the
third.
but
indeed,
there
may
be
circumstances
where
the
government
becomes
the
only
provider
of
food.
our
society,
our
social
fabric
will
have
changed
significantly
by
that
point.
but
in
the
case
of
the
commuter
railroad,
the
economy
and
the
social
well-being
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
my
judgment
collapses
if
we
don't
have
public
transit.
i
think
that
is
a
fact
of
which
the
second
circuit
took
notice
and
which
this
court
can
take
notice.
and
there
is
no
other
available
alternative.
unlike
the
railroad
at
issue
in
california
v.
taylor,
unlike
the
oil
and
gas
development
at
issue
in
a
national
league
of
cities
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit,
unlike
the
telephone
company
at
issue
in
another
case,
unlike
even
the
boston
street
railway
at
issue
in
helvering
v.
powers,
this
public
transit
service
in
new
york
is
provided
by
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority
with
subsidies
amounting
to
more
than
a
billion
dollars
a
year
because
there
is
no
alternative
and
because
the
public
depends
on
this
service.
if
you
take
away
the
long
island
railroad
service
from
the
260,000
passengers
a
day
and
you
take
away
the
bus
and
subway
service
from
the
millions
of
passengers
who
depend
on
it,
the
economy
and
the
society
in
new
york
as
we
know
it
collapses.
that's
why
transit
service
has
occupied
such
an
important
place
in
the
public
agenda
in
recent
years.
the
fact
that
it
didn't
have
that
place
on
the
agenda
50
years
ago
or
100
years
ago
does
not,
in
my
view,
disqualify
it
from
the
immunity
afforded
by
national
league
of
cities,
because
the
question
must
be
what
public
services
are
those
which
the
state
most
needs.
if
you
take
the
government's
view
and
say
a
railroad
is
a
railroad,
it's
still
part
of
the
national
railroad
system
because
it
does
this
little
bit
of
freight
traffic,
if
we
abandoned
the
freight,
the
case
wouldn't
be
before
you
because
the
statutory
jurisdiction
would
be
eliminated.
it
would
then
be
a
commuter
railroad
operating
in
one
state
and
not
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act
at
all.
because
we
do,
because
we
do
get
three
or
four
percent
of
our
revenue
from
freight
traffic,
a
percentage
declining
every
year,
we're
subject
to
the
statute,
and
therefore
the
constitutional
issue
arises.
but
i
suggest
that
if
you
ask
yourself,
if
the
courts
faced
with
these
problems
ask
themselves
is
this
a
service
on
which
the
public
depends,
are
there
any
available
alternatives,
the
cases
begin
to
sort
themselves
out.
the
cases
where
the
state
has
exercised
its
sovereign
power
to
go
into
a
business
enterprise,
to
go
into
an
enterprise,
as
chief
justice
burger
put
it
in
the
city
of
lafayette
case,
where
it
interrelates
and
competes
with
private
sector
actors,
those
cases
fall
aside.
there's
no
national
league
of
cities
immunity.
but
the
cases
like
this
qualify.
and
if
you
decide,
as
the
government
urges,
that
this
is
somehow
unique,
this
is
a
railroad,
it's
part
of
the
world
of
railroading
and
the
immunity
doesn't
apply,
the
next
case
to
come
before
you
is
the
bus
and
subway
system
in
new
york.
i
submit
the
bus
and
subway
system--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--if
congress--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--i
have
no
doubt
that
just
as
congress
in
1974
applied
the
minimum
wage...
or
1966...
applied
the
minimum
wage
to
the
bus
and
subway
system,
they
could
apply
a
collective
bargaining
law
if
this
immunity
established
by
the
court
in
national
league
of
cities
did
not
exist.
and
if
congress
can
tell
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
state
of
new
york
that
it
must
permit
the
bus
and
subway
workers
the
right
to
strike,
then
the
essence
of
state
sovereignty
is
clearly
affected.
my
point
is
that
the--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--i'm
not
sure
that
the
elevator
operators
are
providing
the
kind
of
service
that
meets
the
test
of
public
dependent.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
but
if
those
elevator
operators
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
private
companies
rather
than
the
state
of
new
york,
then
they
are
clearly
within
the
reach
of
this
court,
of
the
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
that
was
the
issue
decided
in
the
hodel
case,
in
the
surface
mining
cases.
now,
the
government
makes
a
good
deal
of
the
fact
that
we
are
engaged
in
freight
traffic.
we
do
have
a
certain
number
of
freight
cars.
that
connects
us
to
the
federal
railway
labor
act
and
raises
this
question
of
constitutional
immunity.
but
i
suggest
that
the
test
in
circumstances
where
the
state
is
engaged
in
some
aspect
of
its
activity
subject
to
the
commerce
power
against
a
backdrop
where
it's
underlying
character,
its
fundamental
character
of
the
service
qualifies
for
the
immunity,
the
incidental
activity
can't
dictate
the
result.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes.
let
me
clarify
the
statistics.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
don't
think
anyone
doubts
that
in
1981
we
received
some
$9
or
$10
million
from
freight
revenue
after
you
deduct
the
freight
surcharge
which
the
icc
has
required
be
reimbursed.
that
$9
or
$10
million
contrasts
with
about
$200
million
of
operating
revenue...
that's
10
percent...
and
over
$400
million
of
total
revenue,
including
public
subsidies.
and
my
figure
of
four
percent,
which
was
based
on
1979,
would
now
actually
be
about
2
1/2
percent
for
1981
if
you
look
at
the
total
revenue
picture
rather
than
just
the
fare
box
revenue.
and
i
suggest
that
on
one
level
the
statistics
don't
matter
whether
it's
four
percent
or
six
percent
or
two
percent.
what
we
do
know
from
the
historical
record
is
that
the
amount
of
freight
service
is
declining;
as
a
result
of
freight
rate
deregulation
it
is
likely
to
decline
further.
and
my
point
is
that
the
basic
character
of
the
railroad
is
a
part
of
the
transit
system
of
metropolitan
new
york
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mta,
and
that
basic
character
cannot
be
divested
by
virtue
of
four,
or
two,
or
six
percent
freight
any
more
than
the
print
shop
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
divests
the
court
of
the
national
league
of
cities
immunity,
or
any
more
than
the
mechanics
in
the
police
department
divest
the
police
department
of
national
league
of
cities.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
unfortunately,
there's
no
way
of
construing
the
railway
labor
act
that
way
in
view
of
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
applies
its
procedures
to
any
railroad
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
it's
well
established
that
freight
traffic
is
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
would
be
pleased--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--no,
it
would
not.
the
railway
labor
act
makes
clear
that
it
does
not
apply
to
a
railroad
carrying
passengers
intrastate.
if
that
were
our
sole
activity,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
statute
would
not
apply.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
would
be
pleased
if
the
court
took
that
statutory--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--i
think
that
argument
was
made
below
and
rejected
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit.
i
think--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--i
would
be
pleased
to
have
it
as
an
alternative
ground.
i
think
in
fact
the
cases
are
a
bit
against
me
in--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--in
the
respect
that
the
jurisdictional
peg...
if
there
were
no
constitutional
issue,
congress'
capacity
to--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--yes.
if
the
court
can
find
in
the
state's
favor
on
statutory
grounds,
we
would
be
most
pleased.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes.
that's
the
railway
retirement
act.
with
respect
to
existing
participants
in
that
plan
there
are
obviously
due
process
questions.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
with
respect
to
the
future,
if
you
apply
the
test
i
described--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--i
think
the
answer
would
be
no.
that
is
no
less
an
employment
condition
than
a
minimum
wage,
and
certainly
no
less
than
prescribing
a
method
of
waste
determination.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
think
in
the
case
of
social
security
the
matter
may
be
more
difficult.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
think
the
degree
of
intrusion
is
much
less.
you
are
not
necessarily
displacing,
subjecting
the
public
employees.
and
i'm
not
sure.
i
must
say
i'm
not
sure
about
the
earlier
cases
on
social
security.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes.
there's
no
question
that
now
they
are.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
they
are
on
the
official
roster
of
the
state
by
virtue
of
the
action
the
mta
took
in
1980
to
change
the
long
island
from
a
subsidiary
stock
corporation
to
a
public
benefit
corporation.
and
the
government
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
for
many
years
the
mta
consented
or
accepted
their
status
as
non-public
employees,
but
my
argument
is
that
the
important
thing
is
the
state's
choice.
the
state
will
exercise
its
sovereign
choice
sometimes
well,
sometimes
poorly,
sometimes
late;
but
what
the
constitution
protects
by
virtue
of
national
league
of
cities
is
the
power
to
make
those
choices
in
areas
at
the
heart
of
the
exercise
of
sovereignty.
if
the
right
to
strike,
if
the
prescription
of
employment
conditions
is
such
a
qualifying
decision,
then
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
that
choice
in
1980
just
as
much
as
it
had
the
right
to
make
the
choice
in
1966.
in
point
of
fact
what
happened
is
new
leadership,
new
problems
in
the
state
involving
a
transit
crisis,
a
new
attention
to
the
means
of
infusing
into
the
system
the
kind
of
capital
that
the
transit
system
needed
was
associated
with
a
judgment
that
that
capital
financing
program
had
to
be
closely
related
with
a
coordinated
approach
to
collective
bargaining.
and
you
couldn't
have
a
system
in
which
the
bus
and
subway
workers,
the
triborough
bridge
workers
were
subject
to
the
state's
collective
bargaining
procedures,
and
the
6800
employees
of
the
long
island
operated
under
an
entirely
different
regime
with
different
rules
and
different
procedures.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
since
1834,
1844.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
they
had
been
operating
as
a
railroad--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--it
became
horrible,
mr.
justice
marshall--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--exactly.
because
the
transit
system
is
broke
and
is
operating
as
a
drain
to
the
tune
of
more
than
a
billion
dollars
a
year
on
tax
proceeds.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
not
at
all.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
under
state
law,
as
has
been
true
in
the
bus
and
subway
system,
we
will
have
good
collective
bargaining,
we
will
have
fair
wage
settlements,
we
will
avoid
strikes
hopefully,
although
as
you
know,
we
did
not
in
1980,
and
we
will
have
most
of
all
the
state
of
new
york
making
its
own
choice
about
the
way
in
which
authority
is
to
be
shared
with
employee
organizations.
and
in
these
circumstances,
i
think
as
solicitor
general
bork
conceded
in
the
national
league
of
cities
argument,
that
decision
on
the
design
of
collective
bargaining
procedures
is
at
the
very
center
of
sovereign
power.
there's
no
choice,
no
decision
in
this
day
and
age
that
a
state
government
makes
that
is
as
important
to
the
exercise
of
its
governmental
authority
as
its
choice
about
how
and
when
and
whether
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining.
and
we
submit,
on
the
other
side
of
the
case,
that
there's
no
service
that
the
state
provides
that
is
as
much
at
the
heart
of
sovereign
power
in
the
sense
of
public
dependence
and
the
lack
of
available
alternatives
than
is
transit
service.
finally,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
when
the
state
of
new
york
through
the
mta
addresses
transit
problems,
it
doesn't
distinguish
between
the
long
island
railroad
and
the
bus
and
subway
system.
it
decides...
i
mean
what,
after
all,
does
the
mta
chairman
and
the
board
decide?
they
pick
people
to
run
those
services.
they
decide
on
a
capital
budget
program,
including
last
year's
authorization
for
$7.8
billion
of
improved
capital
improvements,
$750
million
on
the
long
island
railroad;
and
they
decide
how
to
structure
their
relationships
with
the
employees
who
provide
the
service,
and
how
to
negotiate
fairly
with
them.
all
those
decisions
are
made
by
the
chairman
and
the
board
of
the
mta
not
by
saying
the
long
island
is
different
from
the
bus
and
subway
system;
they're
all
part
of
the
same
system.
and
in
fact,
even
the
technology
is
hard
to
distinguish.
certainly
the
long
island
still
has
point-to-point
fares,
and
they
still
have
conductors
collecting
tickets,
but
three-quarters
of
their
passenger
cars
are
self-propelled
electrical
cars
drawing
electric
power
from
a
third
rail.
the
definition
that
apta,
the
trade
association,
has
to
distinguish
a
heavy
rail
subway
from
a
commuter
railroad
is
that
a
commuter
railroad
is
featured
by
point-to-point
fares
and
railroad
employment
practices.
and
i
suggest
that
the
question
of
whether
this
commuter
railroad
should
have
railroad
employment
practices
is
not
a
definition
that
distinguishes
it
from
subways;
it's
the
very
issue
in
the
case.
it's
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
service
that
qualifies
for
immunity
for
those
federal
commerce
regulations
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
state's
exercise
of
its
sovereignty.
thank
you.
