mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
will,
your
honor.
our
position
concisely
is
that
a
maximum
fee
agreement
has
many
of
the
objectionable
features
of
an
ordinary
price
cartel,
that
although
the
arrangement
is
denominated
a
maximum
fee
arrangement,
that
the
individual
doctors
have
very
little
incentive
to
charge
less
than
the
prescribed
maximum.
in
this
case,
it
is
stipulated
that
almost
all
of
them
do
charge
the
maximum,
and
it
is
also
stipulated
that
every
year
they
hike
the
maximum
further
and
further,
which
raises
the
costs
of
the
insurance
companies
that
do
business
with
the
foundations,
and
ultimately
redounds
to
the
detriment
of
the
consumers
that
pay
for
the
premiums
on
the
insurance
policies.
our
position
is
that
it
is
harmful
to
consumers,
and
i
will
elaborate
that
point
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
no
indication
of
their
position
in
this
record.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no
indication
of
that
in
this
record.
our
submission
is
that
the
maximum
fee
schedules
that
were
adopted
by
the
foundations
are
in
fact
per
se
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
and
we
further
contend
that
the
per
se
rule
can
be
applied
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation,
in
view
of
the
specific
admissions
which
the
foundations
made
in
the
district
court.
i
would
like
first
to
describe
the
legal
standard
which
governs
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
and
then
explain
why
arizona
was
entitled
to
summary
judgment
under
that
standard.
ever
since
this
court's
ruling
in
socony-vacuum,
it
has
been
black
letter
law
that
competitors
may
not
combine
to
restrain
independent
decision-making
on
price.
as
the
court
stated
in
socony,
and
i
quote,
"any
combination
which
tampers
with
price
structures
is
engaged
in
an
unlawful
activity.
"
and
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
kiefer-stewart,
the
court
reaffirmed
that
an
agreement
among
competitors
fixing
maximum
prices
is
subject
to
the
per
se
prohibition
just
like
a
uniform
price
agreement
or
a
minimum
price
agreement.
in
professional
engineers,
the
court
summarized
its
past
opinions
concisely
by
stating
that
any
agreement
that
interferes
with
the
setting
of
price
by
free
market
forces
is
unlawful
on
its
face.
of
course,
the
per
se
rule
must
be
confined
by
the
scope
of
its
rationale.
it
applies
to
so-called
naked
restraints
which
cut
off
competitive
or
independent
decision-making
by
independent
rivals.
it
does
not
ordinarily
apply
to
agreements
on
price
which
are
necessary
components
of
joint
productive
activity.
this
distinction
is
illustrated
by
a
familiar
example.
if
a
group
of
attorneys
gets
together
and
establishes
a
schedule
of
fees,
this
is
a
per
se
violation
as
the
court
held
in
the
goldfarb
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
minimum
fees.
and
under
kiefer-stewart,
maximum
fees
are
subject
to
the
same
pet
se
prohibition.
but
if
that
same
group
of
lawyers
gets
together
and
establishes
a
law
firm,
they
may
agree
on
the
prices
which
they
charge
their
clients.
members
of
firms
are
not
expected
to
compete
against
one
another
or
to
attempt
to
divert
business
from
each
other.
joint
productive
activity
defends
on
cooperation
rather
than
internal
competition
in
an
integrated
business
entity,
such
as
a
partnership.
accordingly,
the
relevant
inquiry
in
this
case
is
twofold.
first,
have
competitors
in
fact
entered
into
an
agreement
limiting
their
pricing,
independence,
and
second,
if
they
have,
is
that
agreement
an
essential
facet
of
joint
productive
activity,
as
in
the
case
of
a
partnership
or
a
merger
of
medical
practices
into
a
health
maintenance
organization?
in
this
case,
these
questions
can
all
be
answered
with
dispatch.
in
fact,
all
of
the
information
that
is
needed
to
render
a
judgment
on
liability
is
contained
in
the
foundation's
very
extensive
admissions
of
fact
which
are
on
pages
156
through
273
of
the
joint
appendix
in
this
court.
let
me
now
summarize
what
the
foundations
have
in
fact
admitted.
the
doctor
members
of
the
foundations
vote
by
mail
ballot
on
maximum
fee
schedules
used
to
determine
the
fees
which
insurance
companies
pay
them,
and
they
agree
to
abide
by
those
maximums.
if
an
insurance
company
wishes
to
do
business
with
the
foundations,
it
must
agree
to
pay
the
doctors
up
to
the
maximum
which
they
have
jointly
prescribed.
the
foundations
have
increased
these
maximums
nearly
on
a
yearly
basis
since
they
were
formed
in
1969
and
1971,
and
only
5
to
15
percent
of
the
doctors
in
maricopa
foundation
bill
less
than
the
prescribed
maximum.
significantly,
when
the
foundations
tried
to
identify
issues
of
fact
for
trial,
they
did
not
suggest
that
the
medical
practices
of
their
members
were
integrated
into
a
partnership
or
a
joint
venture
arrangement.
the
undisputed
fact
is
that
the
doctors
here
involved
are
hundreds
of
independent
practitioners
engaged
in
traditional
fee
for
service
medicine.
accordingly,
their
price
fixing
falls
into
the
category
of
a
naked
restraint,
and
is
not
an
essential
facet
of
joint
integrated
medical
practice.
we
note
in
this
connection
that
the
claims
payment
and
review
activities
which
the
foundations
carry
on
do
not
require
that
the
doctors
prescribe
their
prices,
and
the
foundations
have
never
made
any
contrary
assertion.
in
a
period
in
which
everyone
is
vitally
concerned
with
inflation
in
the
health
care
industry,
it
may
seem
somewhat
unusual
for
the
government
to
argue
that
doctors
should
not
ban
together
and
prescribe
maximum
prices
for
themselves.
in
fact,
however,
maximum
price
fixing
is
no
cure
for
rising
costs
in
the
health
care
industry.
maximum
price
fixing
has
many
of
the
objectionable
features
of
an
ordinary
price
cartel.
for
example,
if
the
doctors--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--thank
you,
sir.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
submission
is
that
maximum
price
fixing
has
many
of
the
objectionable
features
of
an
ordinary
price
cartel,
and
that
is
the
reason
this
court
condemned
it
in
kiefer-stewart
as
illegal
per
se.
for
example,
if
the
doctors
prescribe
a
maximum
price
of
$1,000
for
a
particular
operation,
and
most
of
them
actually
charge
that
maximum,
as
the
record
here
shows,
then
the
maximum
has
many
of
the
features
of
a
fixed
uniform
price,
and
since
it
is
always
in
the
power
of
the
combination
to
raise
the
price,
the
so-called
maximum
is
not
a
maximum
at
all,
because
it
can
be
hiked
at
will
by
the
doctors
themselves,
as
this
record
clearly
shows.
moreover,
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
a
professed
goal
of
having
reasonable
prices
is
an
excuse
for
price
agreements
among
competitors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
arizona's
point
is
that
the
agreement
could
be
used
to
keep
out
other
doctors
through
depression
of
the
price,
and
it
could
be
used
to
inflate
the
cost
of
health
insurance
through
elevating
the
costs.
it
is
the
aggregation
of
power
through
the
combination
to
do
those
two
things
that
is
illegal.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
do
not.
that
is
precisely
what
you
don't
need
to
know
in
a
case
of
naked
price
fixing,
as
this
court
held
in
socony
and
in
trenton
potteries,
and
many
of
it's
other
decisions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
the
potential,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
trenton
potteries.
it
is
the
aggregation
of
power
to...
which
could
be
pressed
to
improper
ends
that
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
condemns
as
illegal
per
se.
the
aggregation
of
power
in
a
price
fixing
combination.
this
court's...
let
me
illustrate
the
point
that
i
was
making
a
moment
ago.
if
the
foundations
were
permitted
to
enforce
their
own
conception
of
a
reasonable
maximum
price,
there
would
be
an
inevitable
tendency
to
adjust
that
price
upwards
to
promote
their
own
economic
welfare,
and
as
this
court
emphasized
in
the
socony
case,
those
who
fixed
reasonable
prices
today
would
fix
unreasonable
prices
tomorrow,
and
any
insurance
company
that
wished
to
do
business
with
the
combination
would
be
compelled
to
pay
up
to
the
fixed
maximum
price.
i
would
also
point
out
in
this
connection
that
although
the
foundation's
claim
that
a
maximum
price
is
essential
to
contain
medical
costs,
they
fail
to
suggest
a
single
reason
why
that
maximum
price
needs
to
be
prescribed
by
a
combination
of
competitors.
if
in
fact
a
maximum
price
is
a
useful
feature
in
medical
insurance
plans,
the
maximum
can
be
prescribed
by
individual
insurers
who
pay
for
the
medical
services
and
who
actually
have
an
incentive
to
reduce
medical
expenditures.
that
is
the
way
the
blue
shield
insurance
policies
operate
throughout
this
country.
the
present
price
fixing
scheme
prevents
individual
insurers
from
obtaining
competitively
negotiated
agreements
with
individual
doctors,
and
interferes
with
their
efforts
to
contain
medical
costs.
that
is
bad
for
the
consumers,
who
pay
for
the
insurance
premiums.
in
short,
this
price
fixing
scheme
poses
a
serious
threat
to
competitive
conditions.
it
can
be
enjoined
without
causing
injury
to
any
joint
productive
activity.
in
these
circumstance,
we
submit,
the
per
se
rule
is
properly
applied,
and
it
is
properly
applied
on
the
record
which
is
now
before
this
court.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
white
motors
case
some
time
ago,
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
use
summary
judgment
procedures
in
a
horizontal
price
fixing
case,
and
it
referred
to
the
kiefer-stewart
decision,
which
is
a
maximum
price
fixing
case,
in
making
that
observation.
for
there
reasons,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
justice
department's
consistent
position
has
been
that
if
individual
doctors
sign
up
individually
on
the
dotted
line,
which
is
the
procedure,
it
is
perfectly
all
right.
but
if
the
doctors
combine
together
and
use
their
concerted
power
to
negotiate
with
the
individual
insurer
to
establish
that
price,
that
is
illegal
per
se.
that
is
what
our
business
review
letters
have
said
for
the
past
decade.
thank
you
very
much.
