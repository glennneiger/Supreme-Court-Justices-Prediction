mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
what
the
lower
courts
have
characterized
as
a
controlling
question
of
law
on
which
there
is
substantial
ground
for
difference
of
opinion.
the
united
states
district
court
denied
our
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
question
of
a
violation,
on
the
ground
that
the
legality
of
respondent's
agreed
upon
fee
schedules
was
to
be
judged
under
the
rule
of
reason
rather
than
per
se
rule.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
to
be
sure,
and
we
subsequently
filed,
justice
rehnquist,
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
question
of
violation,
based
on
the
rule
of
reason.
that
motion
was
filed
in
support
of
our
papers
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
both
of
those
questions
were
before
the
ninth
circuit,
both
the
1292b
petition
for
interlocutory
appeal
and
the
appeal
of
the
denial
of
summary
judgment
motion.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
no,
your
honor.
summary
judgment
had
been
denied
by
the
district
court
under
both
the
rule
of
reason
theory
and
per
se
theory,
and
our
request
for
continuation
of
the
preliminary
injunction
was
also
denied
under
the
theory
that
it
did
not
violate
either
the
per
se
standard
and
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
show
that
it
violated
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
he
did
in
fact
give
us
leave
to
refile.
we
did
in
fact
refile
it.
he
did
in
fact
deny
it.
i
think
the
question
this
court
has
to
decide
is
how
much
additional
discovery
need
be
taken
and
on
what
additional
issues
must
discovery
be
taken
if
at
all
before
reaching
a
decision.
i
think,
as
we
talk
in
the
briefs,
there
is
talk
in
the
papers
about
disputed
facts,
about
the
desire
for
further
discovery,
but
i
think
the
facts,
justice
rehnquist,
necessary
for
this
court's
decision
are
clear
and
simple,
undisputed,
and
have
been
established
by
respondent's
own
rule
36
admissions
and
the
affidavits
respondents
themselves
have
prepared
and
submitted
and
filed
with
the
lower
courts,
and
those
facts
are
really
only
three.
one,
respondents
are
trade
associations
of
competing
physicians.
two,
as
part
of
their
activities,
respondents
formulate
and
prepare
lists
of
prices
covering
the
range
of
services
that
they
perform.
three,
as
part
of
their
function,
the
respondents
prepare
minimum
standards
which
they
utilize
in
endorsing
pre-paid
health
plans,
whether
insurance
health
plans
or
by
third
party
payors
such
as
the
state
of
arizona,
which
reimburses
health
care
plans
as
an
employer.
for
an
insurer
or
an
employer
to
receive
respondents'
endorsement,
the
third
party
payor
must
agree
to
accept
these
minimum
standards,
one
of
which
is
the
agreement
to
pay
respondent's
members
up
to
the
amount
set
forth
in
the
agreed
upon
fee
schedules.
in
return,
in
return,
respondents'
members
agree
not
to
bill
any
more
than
what
is
set
forth
in
those
fee
schedules.
those
facts,
justice
rehnquist,
are
established
beyond
cavil.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
physician
can...
a
member
of
the
society,
a
member
of
one
of
the
respondents
can
bill
less
than
the
fee
schedule.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
not
at
all.
he
could
prepare
a
piece
of
paper
that
said
more.
he
has
been
guaranteed
of
receiving
what
is
set
in
the
fee
schedule.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
he
is
under
a
contractual
obligation
as
a
member
of
the
society,
of
the
respondent
society--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--not
to
seek
to
collect--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
i
would
think
the
claim
would
be
between
the
insurance
carrier--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--there
is
not
an
arizona
court
decision
i
can
cite
you
to,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest,
justice
rehnquist,
that
questions
such
as
that
are
irrelevant.
going
back
into
the
decisions
of
this
court,
starting
out
with
justice
peckham's
opinion
in
the
trans-missouri
freight
association
case,
continuing
through
the
recent
decision
in
cases
such
as
california
retail
liquor
dealers
versus
midcal
aluminum,
any
agreement,
any
agreement
among
competitors
raising,
lowering,
stabilizing
prices
is
itself
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
your
honor,
any
agreement
among
competitors
to
set
prices
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
mr.
justice
white,
any
agreement
among
competitors
to
set
prices
is
a
per
se
violation.
any
person
obviously
has
a
legal
right
not
to
abide
by
that
agreement.
an
agreement
to
fix
prices
is
legally
unenforceable.
the
oil
companies
in
socony-vacuum
oil
company
could
not
legally
have
been
compelled
to
abide
by
the
price
fixing
agreement.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
i
would
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
because
the
agreement
among
the
physicians,
one
of
the
criteria
on
which
they
signed
their
membership
application
when
they
joined
the
foundation
is
agree
not
to
seek
recovery,
not
to
receive
more
than
the
amount
of
money
set
forth
by
the
fee
schedule.
anybody
can
file
a
piece
of
paper
and
go
down
to
court
and
seek
recovery
on
a
claim,
seek
recovery
on
a
claim,
whether
it
has
merit
or
not.
there
is
a
contractual
obligation
and
an
agreement
among
the
competing
physicians
that
they
will
accept
the
amount
set
forth
in
the
fee
schedules.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
your
honor,
i
would
direct
your
attention
to
page
9
of
respondent's
reply
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
red.
quoting,
"foundation
member
health
care
providers
agreed
to
accept
as
payment
in
full
for
patients
covered
by

insurance
the
maximum
level
of
reimbursement
from
the

for
services
rendered.
"
i
also
direct
your
attention
to
the
affidavit
of
thomas
finley,
the
executive
director
of
one
of
the
foundations.
it
appears
at
page
78
of
the
joint
appendix,
at
paragraph
16
of
his
affidavit,
and
i
think
his
statement
there
nicely
sums
up
what
is
involved
here.
this
is
an
affidavit
prepared
by
the
respondents
and
signed
by
one
of
respondent's
executives.
quote:
"the
foundation
does
exercise
direct
control
over
the
establishment
of

rates
for

services.
"
direct
control.
that
is
his
language.
"however,
these
rates
are
a
ceiling,
not
a
floor,
for
foundation
members.
"
"each
doctor
who
is
a
member
of

expressly
agrees
that

will
be
reimbursed
at
no
more
than
the
maximum
rate
established
by
the
foundation.
"
period,
close
quote.
there
is
no
question,
your
honor,
that
there
is
that
express
agreement.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
by
the
insurance
company
or
other
third
party
payor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
except
to
the
extent
of
the
deductible
coverage,
or
the
first
$100
that
may
be
paid
in
any
one
calendar
year.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
excuse
me,
justice
stevens.
i
am
not
sure
i
understood.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
this
may
be
characterized
as
a
maximum
fee
schedule
is
of
no
moment.
again,
the
cases
have
consistently
held
in
this
court
that
any
agreement
among
competitors
raising,
lowering,
stabilizing,
tampering
with
prices
is
a
per
se
violation.
justice
peckham's
opinion
in
trans-missouri
made
that
point,
one
of
the
first
price
fixing
cases
before
this
court.
the
most
recent
case
to
present
this
issue,
midcal
aluminum,
again,
maximum
price
fixing
is
unlawful.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
foundation
member
physicians
have
approximately
70
percent
of
the
physicians
in
the
area
as
members.
the
precise
market
share
i
cannot
tell
you.
your
honor,
the
precise
market
share
is
not
a
matter
that
is
relevant
either
to
a
per
se
analysis
or
rule
of
reason
analysis.
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
go
back
to
judge
addison
pipe,
and
take
it
through
to
former
solicitor
general
robert
borak's
most
recent,
i
think
very
thoughtful
analysis
of
antitrust
paradox,
makes
a
very
telling
point.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
to
be
sure,
your
honor.
fortunately,
however,
i
think
the
rationale
was
accepted
by
this
court
when
it
affirmed
the
nationwide
trailer
rental
case
and
again
in
the
broadcast
music
case
by
justice
white,
and
again
in
the
gte
sylvania
case,
and
the
point
is
this,
that
where
there
is
economic
integration,
where
there
is
a
pooling
of
productive
assets,
a
sharing
of
risk
and
benefits,
an
incidental
elimination
of
price
competition
is
permissible.
thus,
judge
taft
in
addison,
justice
white,
you
made
this
point
yourself
in
bmi
when
you
made
mention
of
partnerships--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--to
be
sure.
when
you
made
the
reference
to
partnerships,
mergers,
or
joint
ventures
as
being
examples
where
economic
assets
have
been
pooled,
there
is
a
sharing
of
risk
and
benefits.
there,
there
is
an
economic
integration.
even
where
there
are
only
two
individuals,
and
this
is
robert
borak's
example,
two
individuals
that
legitimately
form
a
partnership
and
pool
their
assets,
if
they
independently,
without
pooling
their
assets,
agree
to
eliminate
competition,
that
is
a
per
se
violation
without
regard
to
their
market
share.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
absolutely.
absent
an
economic
integration
of
the
productive
assets,
whether
it
is
10
percent
or
whether
it
is
only
two
physicians,
agreeing
on
prices,
that
is
a
per
se
violation,
absent
an
economic
integration
of
pooling
of
assets,
absent
the
sharing
of
risk
benefits.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
that
two
persons
cannot
horizontally--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--not
two
persons.
but
i
think,
justice
stevens,
if
you
refer
back
to
justice
douglas's
opinion
in
socony-vacuum,
he
did
indicate,
and
i
think
very
definitely
in
his
footnote
59,
that
it
matters
not.
the
section
1
violation
is
complete,
even
though
the
conspirators
do
not
have
the
power
to
carry
out
their
agreement.
power
to
accomplish
the
end
is
not
relevant.
it
is
not
material
to
the
violation.
so,
to
be
sure,
we
have
not
had
before
this
court
the
precise
situation
of
those
two
individuals,
but
we
have
had
the
issue
decided.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
i
think
that
is
not
necessarily
the
case,
your
honor.
in
the
opinion
in
the
nationwide
trailer
case,
which
was
affirmed
per
curium
by
this
court,
the
district
court
was
expressly
unable
to
determine
the
market
share
of
the
defendants
and
unable
to
determine
that
the
fee
schedule
had
in
fact
been
used.
it
found
that
the
members
of
the
trade
association
had
among
themselves
prepared,
agreed
upon,
and
published
a
fee
schedule.
it
had
not...
it
did
not
make
any
finding
in
its
findings
of
fact
that
expressly
said
that
it
didn't
have
the
evidence
to
make
any
finding,
that
it
was
used
or
that
it
was
followed,
and
absent
any
showing
of
market
share,
no
ability
to
show
that
they
had
the
power
to
put
it
into
effect.
nonetheless,
the
district
court
there
held
that
the
mere
preparation,
publication,
and
circulation
among
its
members
of
a
fee
schedule
was
a
per
se
violation,
and
this
court
affirmed
that
decision.
i
think
the
respondents
here
have
gone
much
further,
gone
much
further
than
anything
in
any
of
the
earlier
cases
to
come
before
this
court.
the
people
in
socony-vacuum,
the
realtors
in
national
association
of
real
estate
boards,
the
lawyers
in
goldfarb,
the
trailer
rental
operators
in
the
nationwide
trailer
case
agreed
among
themselves
on
the
prices,
on
a
price
list.
they
had
no
guarantee,
however,
that
they
would
be
able
to
receive
the
prices
that
they
agreed
upon
in
their
price
list.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
to
be
sure,
and
so
was
national
association--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--i
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
this
case
presents
a
more
egregious.
the
minimum,
and
while
it
didn't
occur
in
goldfarb,
it
did
occur
in
the
national
association
of
real
estate
boards,
where
there
was
a
stated
minimum,
a
number
of
transactions
went
down
from
there,
and
in
point
of
fact,
transactions
were
made
as
noted
by
justice
douglas
in
that
opinion,
transactions
were
made
below
the
agreed
upon
price.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
your
honor,
that
is
sufficient
to
entitle
me
to
summary
judgment
on
the
question
of
the
violation.
i
think
there
is
much
more
that
we
can
go
into
in
the
medical
profession,
but
on
the
question
of
whether
respondents'
formulation
and
preparation
of
fee
schedules
is
a
violation
of
the
law,
those
facts
those
facts
alone
are
sufficient
to
establish
a
violation.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
regardless
of
the
market
share.
the
only
exception
being
the
question,
is
there
an
economic
integration,
is
there
a
pooling
of
productive
assets?
there
is
not
here.
and
the
simple
agreement
among
non-integrated
competitors,
which
is
what
we
have,
on
a
price
schedule
is
under
the
cases
and
in
my
view
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
what
has
been
done
here
is
more
than
simply
a
minimum
violation,
minimum
fee
schedule,
rather.
the
members
of
this
society
had
guaranteed
themselves
payment
up
to
the
so-called
maximum
that
they
have
agreed
upon,
and
the
effect
of
this,
the
effect
of
this,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
is
evidenced
pretty
clearly
by
something
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
this
litigation,
wherein
the
district
court...
an
injunction
had
remained
in
effect
for
a
few
months,
and
respondents'
members
wanted
to
increase
their
prices.
they
went
into
the
district
court
and
asked
that
the
preliminary
injunction
be
lifted
so
that
they
could
increase
their
prices
an
aggregate
of
$1.8
million
a
month,
and
they
asked
that
as
a
condition
of
a
continuation
of
this
preliminary
injunction,
if
the
injunction
were
to
continue
enjoining
them
from
increasing
their
fee
schedule,
the
state
of
arizona
would
be
required
to
post
a
bond
of
$1.8
million
a
month
for
every
month
that
they
were
enjoined
from
promulgating
a
new
fee
schedule.
even
if
respondents
had
not
gotten
the
guarantee
that
they
would
receive
what
they
had
agreed
upon,
even
if
respondents
had
done
no
more
than
agree
upon
a
maximum
level
of
prices,
establish
maximum
prices,
that
agreement
would
still
be...
should
still
be
per
se
unlawful.
i
go
back
again
to
one
of
the
first
price
fixing
cases
to
come
before
this
court,
justice
peckham's
opinion
in
trans-missouri,
and
he
identified
there
the
evil,
one
of
the
evils
of
a
maximum
price
fixing
agreement
among
competitors,
and
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
of
quoting
to
the
court
from
page
323
of
166
us,
"in
business
or
trading
combinations,
they
may
even
temporarily
or
perhaps
permanently
reduce
the
price
of
an
article
traded
in
or
manufactured.
"
reduce
the
price.
"trade
or
commerce
under
those
circumstances
may
nevertheless
be
badly
and
unfortunately
restrained
by
driving
out
of
business
the
small
leaders
and
worthy
men
whose
lives
have
been
spent
therein.
"
he
went
on
on
the
next
page
to
say,
"in
this
light,
it
is
not
material
that
the
price
of
an
article
may
be
lowered.
"
mr.
peckham
was
talking
hypothetical
economics
there,
but
well
based
economics.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
i
think
the
economic
effect
of
that,
number
one,
to
show
that
justice
peckham
was
not
off
base
is
seen
in
the
second
american
tobacco
case.
the
second
american
tobacco
case,
you
will
recall,
is
where
the
major
tobacco
companies
reduced
their
price
on
the
cigarettes
they
sold
to
provide
a
competitive
alternative
to
the
so-called
ten-cent
brands.
by
reducing
their
price,
they
kept
the
ten-cent
brands
off
the
market.
the
stated
purpose
for
this...
for
the
original
inception
of
these
foundations,
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
joint
brief
in
opposition,
the
red
one,
at
page
8,
"is
a
competitive
alternative
to
the
utilization
of
closed

plans.
"
stated
differently,
a
group
of
competitors,
the
respondents
here,
reducing
their
prices
to
compete
with
hmos,
just
like...
just
like
the
major
tobacco
companies
reduced
their
prices
to
keep
the
ten-cent
cigarettes
off
the
market
in
the
second
american
tobacco
case.

i
would
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
we
could
spend
the
next
ten
years
and
after
ten
years,
or
five
years,
perhaps,
we
could
have
the
definitive
treatise
on
medical
economics.
but
chief
justice
warren
made
a
very
important
point
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
and
that
is
that
we
should
not
protract
already
complex
antitrust
cases
by
looking
into
peripheral
economic
facts.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
and
the
per
se
rule
in
northern
pacific
railroad
is
recognized
as
being
based
in
part
upon
the
necessity
and
the
wisdom
of
avoiding
unnecessary
expenditures
of
judicial
resources.
the
whole
notion
of
rule
56
summary
judgment
proceedings
is
to
decide
cases
prior
to
trial,
if
possible,
when
all
of
the
material
facts
have
been
established
beyond
dispute.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
because
under
rules
56e
and
56f,
a
party
posing
a
summary
judgment
motion
has
the
obligation
of
identifying
material
issues
of
disputed
fact
that
require
a
trial,
or
under
56f,
if
there
hasn't
been
enough
of
an
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery,
identifying
the
specific
issues
of
fact
on
which
further
discovery
is
required
that
will
require
trial.
first
of
all,
we
have
never
during
the
course
of
this
litigation
had
a
56e
statement
or
a
56f
statement.
be
that
as
it
may,
there
have
been
a
number
of
factual
contentions
that
have
been
raised
that
it
has
been
suggested
require
further
discovery
or
that
it
has
been
suggested
are
in
dispute.
justice
rehnquist,
yes,
we
could
conduct
five
years
or
ten
years
of
court
time
and
lawyers'
time
to
explore
those.
none
of
those
matters
are
material.
none
of
those
matters
require
a
trial.
the
fact
that
a
group
of
independent
competitors
agree
on
a
fee
schedule...
under
nationwide
trailer
rental,
that
is
enough
to
constitute
the
violation.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
i
think
starting
with
socony-vacuum,
justice
douglas
said
there
that
as
far
as
the
price
fixing
law
goes,
the
sherman
act
establishes
one
rule
of
law
for
all
industries,
and
again
in
goldfarb,
and
again
in
professional
engineers,
this
court
said,
this
court
held
that
the
particular
nature
of
an
industry
does
not
create
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
not
at
all.
not
on
the
question
of
violation.
mr.
kenneth
r.

to
be
sure.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
absolutely.
the
insurance
company
or
other
third
party
reimbursers,
like
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
the
third
party
reimbursement
mechanism,
your
honor,
justice
white--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--on
the
question
of
violation,
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
agreement
here
violates
the
antitrust
laws,
that
is
not
an
issue.
it
is
a
partial
summary
judgment.
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
before
this
court
simply
with
the
matter
of
whether
this
agreement
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
not
who
has
standing
to
sue,
not
the
amount
of
damages,
not
jurisdictional
issues,
not
the
mccaren
ferguson
issue.
those
are
all
matters
which
were
not
appealed
from
which
are
still
in
the
district
court.
this
is
the
narrow
controlling
question
of
law,
certified
by
the
district
court,
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
whether
the
agreement
involved
here
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
the
question
becomes
whether
the
notion
in
advance,
the
maximum
fee
schedule,
if
you
will,
should
be
set
by
the
insurance
company
unilaterally
or
by
a
horizontal
association
of
competitors.
respondents
take
issue
with
the
state
of
arizona
that
in
our
workmen's
compensation--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--the
medical
association
has
a
group.
the
sherman
act,
i
say,
prohibits
any
agreement
among
competitors
among
that.
it
does
not
prohibit
the
individual
decisions
by
individual
physicians
to
accept
a
unilateral
maximum
schedule
promulgated
by--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--that's
correct.
individuals,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
i
believe
the
number
is
four
with
regard
to
the
pima
foundation
for
medical
care,
and
seven
with
regard
to
the
maricopa
foundation
for
medical
care.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
in
order
for
an
insurance
company
to
be
endorsed
by
the
foundation,
to
be
accepted
by
the
foundation,
the
insurance
company
must
agree
to
accept
the
foundation's
minimum
standards.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
there
is
no
divergence.
there
is
one
set
of
minimum
standards
by
the
foundations
which
the
different
insurance
companies
must
accept.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
may
the
fee
schedules
change
from
year
to
year?
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
during--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--i
believe
there
is--
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
--to
be
sure.
mr.
kenneth
r.
reed
they
are
not
parties.
there
was
during
the
course
of
the
lower
court
proceedings,
when
the
desire
to
raise
prices
$1.8
million
a
month
came
up,
affidavits
were
submitted
by
the
executive
directors
of
both
foundations
saying
that
unless
we
can
increase
our
prices
by
this
amount,
an
estimate
of
one-quarter
to
one-half
the
members
of
the
maricopa
foundation
and
one-quarter
to
one-third
of
the
members
of
the
pima
foundation
were
threatening
to
resign
unless
they
could
get
this
$1.8
million
a
month
price
increase.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
