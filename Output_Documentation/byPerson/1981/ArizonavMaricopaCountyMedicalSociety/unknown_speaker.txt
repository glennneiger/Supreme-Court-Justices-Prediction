unknown
speaker
he
did
deny
it
with
leave
to
file
a
similar
motion
later
after
more
discovery
had
taken
place,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
summary
judgment
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
judge
coppel
give
you
leave
to
renew
your
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
either
standard
after
more
discovery
had
taken
place,
just
that
there
wasn't
enough
facts
in
the
record
to
say
what
the
effect
of
the
plan
was?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
physician
was
free
to
bill
the
patient
whatever
he
wanted.
unknown
speaker
what
about
more?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
patient
wishes
to
pay
him
more,
and
he
sends
a
bill
to
the
patient
for
more,
and
the
patient
pays
him
more,
he
doesn't
have
to
return
it,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
can
he
enforce
his
higher
bill
in
court
against
a
patient?
unknown
speaker
not
to.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
the
patient
defend
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
know
from
any
arizona
court
decision
whether
the
patient
can
defend
on
the
basis
of
this
agreement?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
justice
rehnquist's
question
really
goes
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
such
agreement
like
that
at
all.
if
these
doctors
are
completely
free,
despite
what
some
piece
of
paper
says,
to
charge
the
patient
more,
and
they
do,
what
kind
of
an
agreement
to
set
prices
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
saying,
is
there
an
agreement
if
the
first
line
says,
we
agree,
and
the
next
line
says,
we
don't
agree?
unknown
speaker
following
up
on
justice
white's
question,
supposing
that
the
agreement,
if
there
be
such,
of
the
foundation
says
that
you
will
not
charge
more
than...
you
will
not
be
reimbursed
or
charge
more
than
$900
for
this
service,
and
the
physician
gets
his
$900
reimbursement
but
bills
the
patient
$1,600,
and
the
patient
says,
no,
i
don't
want
to
pay
$1,600
and
doesn't
pay
the
$1,600.
can
the
physician
nonetheless
sue
him
and
collect
it?
unknown
speaker
what
makes
you
think
not?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
record
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
color?
unknown
speaker
will
be
reimbursed
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
but
not
necessarily
by
the
patient.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
a
term
of
the
agreement
that
the
doctor
will
charge
nothing
to
the
customer
except
the
reimbursible
expense?
unknown
speaker
does
not
the
overall
agreement
provide
that
the
doctor
who
joins
the
plan
when
he
is
performing
services
for
an
insured
person
under
the
plan
will
collect
all
of
his
fees
from
the
insurance
company
except
for
the
deductible
amount?
unknown
speaker
so
there
won't
be
an
additional
charge
to
the
customer
if
the
agreement
is
adhered
to.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
foundation's
share
of
the
market
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
neither
of
them
were
members
of
this
court
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
court
opinion.
the
court
did
it.
unknown
speaker
if
the
foundation
had
only
10
percent
of
the
market
in
maricopa
county,
would
that
be
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reed,
that
may
be
a
fair
inference
from
what
the
court
has
said,
but
the
court
has
never
quite
said
that,
has
it?
it
has
never
said
that
two
people
can't
horizontally
fix
prices.
there
is
no
such
case
cut
of
this
court
that
holds
that
on
all
fours.
unknown
speaker
two
corner
grocers
get
together
and
say,
we
won't
charge
less
than
a
dollar
for
hamburger.
there
is
no
such
case,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
i
think
all
the
price
fixing
cases
in
this
court
have
been
cases
in
which
the
defendants
had
market
dominance.
it
may
be
that
isn't
required,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
justice
douglas's
language
certainly
doesn't
seem
to
require
that.
unknown
speaker
but
goldfarb
was
a
minimum
fee.
a
minimum
fee.
unknown
speaker
and
a
person
could
not
get
the
service
in
this
part
of
virginia
affected
by
goldfarb
from
any
lawyer
except
by
paying
that
minimum
fee.
isn't
that
quite
different
from
a
maximum
fee?
unknown
speaker
is
your
charge
here
primarily
then
one
of
conspiracy,
and
nothing
more?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
the
market
share
or
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
but
do
we
know
that
the
same
effects
would
result
in
the
physician
patient
service
relationship
as
between
the
railroad
shipper
analysis?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
we
know
more
if
we
had
deposition
testimony--
unknown
speaker
--or
witness
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
how
do
you
know
when
all
the
material
facts
have
been
established?
unknown
speaker
whether
it
be
physicians,
a
health
group,
or
trailer
rental,
or
a
shipper
consumer,
none
of
that
varies
at
all?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to
establish
that
there
is
a
direct
connection
between
these
fees
that
you
say,
these
maximum
fees
that
were
agreed
upon
and
insurance
premiums?
unknown
speaker
why?
the
patient
doesn't
pay
the
doctor.
unknown
speaker
and
so
it
is
a
three-cornered
arrangement.
the
doctor
performs
the
services
for
the
patient,
he
charges
the
insurance
company.
unknown
speaker
so
this
isn't
like
other
cases
of
maximum
agreements,
where
the
customer
is
paying
the
price
agreed
upon.
here
the
patient
doesn't
pay
the
doctor
anything.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
there
is
any
connection
between,
or
how
do
you
know
what
the
connection
is
between
these
agreed
upon
fees
and
premiums?
that
is
what
the
patient
pays,
is
a
premium.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
facilitates
the
writing
of
medical
insurance
for
the
insurance
companies
to
have
some
notion
in
advance
of
what
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
insurance
company
comes
to
the
medical
society
and
says,
we
propose...
we
want
to
write
these
plans,
but
we
have
got
to
know
what
premiums
to
charge,
so
we
are
going
to
say
we
will
pay
you
these
figures,
and
they
propose
this
list,
and
they
say,
but
of
course
we
like
to
know
if
you
are...
we
can't
sell
any
insurance
to
anybody
unless
you
all
agree
to
these
figures.
because
no
patient
will
ever...
they
need
some
guarantees.
and
you
say
the
sherman
act
forbids
the
medical
association
from
responding
with
a
yes,
we
agree.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
the
individual
physicians
could
all
write
a
letter
and
say,
we
agree.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reed,
how
many
insurance
companies
are
parties
to
these
agreements?
unknown
speaker
do
they
make
competitive
bids
to
become
parties,
or
how
are
they
selected?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
competition
among
the
insurance
companies?
unknown
speaker
do
they
change
from
year
to
year,
or
may
they
change?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
have
any
non-members,
non-member
doctors
objected
to
this
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
at
least
none
of
them
are
parties
here.
unknown
speaker
you
would
think
they
might
have
an
objection,
because
they
don't
agree
to
limit.
unless
you
are
a
member,
you
haven't
agreed
to
limit
your
billing
to
the
patient.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
not
parties
here,
and
they
haven't--
unknown
speaker
are
the
insurance
companies
objecting?
unknown
speaker
or
of
the
non-member
doctors?
unknown
speaker
minimum.
minimum
fees.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
arizona's
primary
complaint
here
is
the
predatory
nature
of
the
agreement
or
the
keeping
out
of
other
doctors?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
need
to
know
something
about
the
market?
unknown
speaker
you
used
the
phrase
"could
be
used".
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
if
you
are
through?
you
said
there
are
two
components
of
this
agreement,
one
an
agreement
on
what
the
schedule
shall
be,
and
secondly,
each
doctor
agrees
not
to
charge
his
customers
more
than
the
schedule,
as
i
understand
it,
insured,
where
there
is
insurance,
and
you
said
blue
shield
is
different
in
that
blue
shield
specifies
the
schedule.
would
the
blue
shield
program
be
illegal
if
blue
shield
specified
the
schedule
and
if
every
doctor
that
participated
in
the
program
agreed
not
to
charge
in
excess
of
the
schedule?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
connection
shown
by
the
record
between
the
pima
foundation
and
the
maricopa
foundation?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
you
say
on
page
123
of
your
statement
in
opposition
to
summary
judgment
that
with
respect
to
plaintiff's
statement,
one,
that
membership
of
maricopa
county
foundation
includes
medical
doctors,
you
have
no
information
sufficient
to
admit
or
deny
plaintiff's
statement
with
respect
to
pima
foundation?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
the
petitioners
here
want
a
per
se
rule
applied
to
both.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
the
per
se
rule
was
not
to
be
applied?
unknown
speaker
did
it
say
on
a
remand
that
perhaps
the
evidence
would
show
that
a
per
se
rule
should
be
applied
rather
than
rule
of
reason?
unknown
speaker
do
you
leave
it
open?
would
you
say
that
you
are
not
asking
this
court
to
rule
now
that
the
rule
of
reason
should
apply?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
when
all
of
the
evidence
is
in,
it
could
be
that
you
would
lose
but
not
under
the
rule
of
reason,
but
the
court
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
apply
the
rule
of
reason
for
you
to
lose.
unknown
speaker
of
course
you
do.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not
asking
this
court
right
now
to
say
that
we
should
reverse
and
remand
for
a
trial
under
the
rule
of
reason?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
with
a
final
judgment
based
on
the
rule
of
reason.
unknown
speaker
the
answer
to
my
question
is
no,
then.
unknown
speaker
that
is
something
you
would
rely
on
if
you
were
trying
the
case
on
the
merits,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
are
you
also
suggesting
that
in
any
event
this
negates
the
idea
of
applying
a
per
se
rule?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
whether
the
record
shows
that
maximum
fees
have
been
increased
each
year?
i
think
someone
suggested
that.
unknown
speaker
how
often
since
the
agreements
first
went
into
effect?
unknown
speaker
five
increases?
unknown
speaker
over
a
period
of
how
many
years?
unknown
speaker
mr.
berelson,
may
i
interrupt?
i
may
have
misunderstood
something
you
said
before.
in
order
to
accomplish
the
objectives
you
have
just
described,
is
it
correct
that
the
doctor
members
of
the
association
agree
that
the
patients
will
not
have
to
pay
anything
more
than
the
maximum
fee
schedule?
unknown
speaker
if
he
is
covered,
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
limiting
it
to
patients
who
have
the
insurance
and
doctors
who
are
members
of
the
foundation,
is
it
clear
on
this
record
that
there
is
an
agreement
establishing
the
maximum
which
the
patients
must
pay?
unknown
speaker
well,
right,
but
the
maximum
the
insurance
company
will
pay--
unknown
speaker
--which
in
turn
allows
it
to
charge
a
lower
insurance
rate,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
clear
on
the
record
that
there
is
an
agreement
to
fix
the
maximum
fees
that
the
doctors
will
receive
for
the
services
performed
for
this
particular
segment
of
the
market.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
once
the
insurance...
it
is
a
tripartite
thing.
unknown
speaker
once
the
insurance
companies
have
accepted,
and
i
think
four
of
them
have,
there
is
then
in
effect
an
agreement
among
the
doctors
that
in
this
particular
segment
of
their
work
they
will
receive
a
maximum
of
so
many
dollars
for
such
and
such
a
service.
unknown
speaker
what
about
your
colleague's
suggestion
that
blue
cross
operates
a
little
differently?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
times,
those
sometimes--
unknown
speaker
--that
it
manages
to
run
its
business
without
having
an
agreement
among
the
doctors?
unknown
speaker
they
have
individual
doctors
who
sign
up
with
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
something
more
than
that
happens
here.
this
is
an
agreement
among
the
doctors.
in
the
blue
cross
case,
blue
cross
seems
to
be
able
to
present
their
schedules
and
get
individual
doctors
either
agreeing
or
not.
unknown
speaker
no,
something
more
than
that
happen
here.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
just
told
justice
stevens
there
was
an
agreement
among
the
doctors.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
you
told
justice
stevens
that
once
the
insurance
company
agrees
the
doctors
are
bound
to
charge
no
more
than
a
maximum
fee,
and
that
they
have
agreed
among
themselves
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
has
agreed
to
collect
from
the
customer
no
more
than
a
maximum
amount.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
as
we
read
the
record
it
doesn't
look
to
us
like
this
is
the
kind
of
an
operation
that
blue
cross
runs.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
are
suggesting
it
would
be
administratively
impossible--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
insurance
company
to
operate
with
individual
doctors
without
this
kind
of
an
arrangement.
unknown
speaker
individually,
but
he
doesn't
get
together
with
others
and--
unknown
speaker
--who
are
the
trustees
or
members
of
the
foundation?
unknown
speaker
are
there
different
insurance
companies
competing
for
the
business
of
the
foundation,
or
is
it
a
self-insurer?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
prices
have
to
be
agreed
on,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
everybody
charges
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
don't
they
all
have
to
follow
the
same
fee
schedule?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
mean
that.
don't
all
the
insurance
companies
who
sponsor
foundation
plans
agree
that
they
will
reimburse
doctors
at
the
same
rate?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
all
boil
down
to
the
question
that...
the
question
that
is
presented
is
whether
it
is
unlawful
for
a
group
that
is
not
shown
to
be
a
monopoly
to
agree
among
themselves
on
maximum
prices,
and
would
it
be
a
defense
for
them
to
show
that
those
prices
are
lower
than
the
free
market?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
record
shows
that
it
has
not
been
rejected,
it
has
been
accepted.
unknown
speaker
do
those
7
percent
of
the
people...
the
rates
of
those
people
are
enough
to
account
for
$1.8
million
a
year,
the
bond
premium?
unknown
speaker
how
many
people
are
involved,
if
there
is
$8
million
in
savings
every
year?
unknown
speaker
how
many
years
are
involved
in
the
$8
million
saving?
unknown
speaker
about
ten
years?
so
around
$800,000
a
year?
unknown
speaker
savings,
and
that
means
that
what
are
the
aggregate
amounts
of
money
paid,
then,
if
that
is
the
savings
between
what
it
would
be
under
this
program
as
against
some
other
program?
unknown
speaker
it
must
be
several
million
dollars.
unknown
speaker
is
that
just
7
percent
of
the
market
then?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
contention...
let
me
just--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
your
contention
that
even
if
the
record
convinces
us
that
there
is
an
agreement
here
to
impose
a
maximum
level
on
charges
by
doctors
to
insurance
companies
and
patients,
that
that
is
not
unlawful
unless
it
is
further
shown
that
in
a
free
market
the
rates
would
be
higher?
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
that
they
would
be
different.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
the
very
purpose
of
the
whole
arrangement
is
to
keep
insurance
costs
down,
so
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
minimize
the
insurance
costs
for
the
patients.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
you
think
it
will
work,
if
you
are
doing
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it
is
good
for
the
market
because
it
provides
cheaper
medical
care
and
cheaper
insurance,
but
i
don't
think
you
are
saying
it
is
a
totally
useless
gesture,
or
why
bother
with
it?
unknown
speaker
because
it
keeps
costs
down.
unknown
speaker
mr.
berelson,
let
me
put
it
to
you
directly.
do
you
contend
that
the
arrangement
that
you
have
described
has
any
impact
on
the
costs,
on
anybody's
charges
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
it
keeps
prices
down,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
keeps
the
prices
lower
than
they
would
be
under
a
free
market.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
keeps
them
lower
than
if
you
didn't
have
this
arrangement.
unknown
speaker
it
seems,
to
me
your
position
boils
down
to
the
contention,
and
maybe
you
are
right...
i
am
just
trying
to
think
it
through--
unknown
speaker
--that
an
agreement
to
maintain
prices
is
permissible,
if
it
will
keep
prices
down.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true
that
the
patient
can
go
to
any
doctor
he
wants
to
in
the
county?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
goes
to
a
non-member,
he
is
taking
the
risk
that
he
will
be
charged
whatever
the
doctor
wants
to
charge
him.
unknown
speaker
and
how
many,
what
percentage
of
the
patients
do
you
say
are
covered
by--
unknown
speaker
--have
insurance?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
them
go
to
doctors
that
are
members?
or
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
insurance...
that
an
awful
lot
of
doctors...
a
lot
of
patients
are
going
to
non-member
doctors.
unknown
speaker
and
the
insurance
company
seems
to
get
along
all
right.
unknown
speaker
because
they
just
announce...
the
insurance
company
just
has
a...
it
just
says
there
is
a
maximum
that
i
will
reimburse
for,
that's
all.
unknown
speaker
without
any
foundation
at
all,
why
couldn't
the
insurance
companies
sell
policies
and
say,
here
is
our
schedule,
we
will
reimburse
up
to
a
certain
amount
for
these
procedures.
if
your
doctor
happens
to
charge
you
any
more,
that
is
too
bad.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
see
why
this
arrangement
has
anything
to
do
with
insurance
rates.
it
has
got
to
do
with
whether
patients
have
some
limit
to
their
medical
bills.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any...
i
asked
before,
but
i
take
it
that
it
is
correct
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
position
of
the
non-member
doctors
in
the
community
is
with
respect
to
this
arrangement.
unknown
speaker
it
must
be
that
they
haven't
joined,
they
don't
like
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
none
of
them
have
claimed
that
what
this
really
is
is
a
conspiracy
among
the
member
doctors
to
run
them
out
of
business
by
setting
rates,
setting
low
rates
and
getting
all
the
patients
there
are
in
town?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
it,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
real
strange
that
you
say
that
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
this
whole
thing
saves
money,
when
one
of
the
large
patients,
so-called,
the
state
of
arizona,
says,
it
doesn't
save
us
any
money
at
all;
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
costs
us
money.
apparently
that
is
what
they
are
saying.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
are
they
objecting,
if
you
are
saving
them
a
lot
of
money?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
reason,
one
of
the
reasons
for
their
objection
the
feeling
that
if
your
organization
were
not
in
business,
more
hmos
would
be
in
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
are...
the
state
pays
out
a
lot
of
money
for
insurance.
unknown
speaker
so
they
don't
think
that
you
are
bringing
them
any
christmas
present.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
state
antitrust
law?
unknown
speaker
put
this
suit
wasn't
based
on
the
state
antitrust
law?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
pendent
state
claim.
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
record
do
we
find
this
information
that
has
been
alluded
to
about
the
comparison
between
the
increase
in
costs
under
this
plan
and
national
inflation
figures
and
national
medical
fees?
unknown
speaker
appendix?
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
it,
now?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
must
confess,
i
am
puzzled
about
why
we
need
to
know
more.
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
it
is
not
necessarily
unlawful.
but
can't
we
assume
that
you
are
going
to
prove
that
you
have
kept
prices
down,
or
kept
the
rates
down,
and
that
you
have
done
a
wonderful
job
for
the
people
of
the
city,
and
there
are
still
the
same
legal
issues
there?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
a
showing
that
the
prices
are
lower
than
they
would
have
been
if
they
followed
the
general
trend
in
the
economy
has
any
bearing
on
whether
it
is
price
fixing
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
all
that,
but
i
just
don't
understand
how
any
of
the
things
you
have
described
are
relevant
to
the
legal
issue.
unknown
speaker
we
have
to
decide,
a,
is
this
a
price
fixing
agreement,
and
b,
if
it
is,
it
is
obviously
maximum
rather
than
minimum,
although
i
know
there
is
an
argument
to
the
contrary,
but
i
think
you
are
definitely
right
on
that,
and
if
it
is
a
maximum
price
fixing
agreement,
is
it
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
you
are
arguing
that
you
are
creating
something
different.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
is
good,
because
it
keeps
prices
down.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
doctors
don't
perform
different
operations
under
this
plan
than
if
there
were
a
free
market.
you
don't
really
contend
that.
unknown
speaker
you
hope
they
don't,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
they
won't
charge
any
more
than
the
schedule.
unknown
speaker
your
heavy
reliance
on
broadcast
music
makes
me
wonder
if
you
are
in
effect
acknowledging
that
the
fact
that
it
is
doctors
in
the
medical
profession
doesn't
really
have
much
bearing
on
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
or
people
who
sell
music.
unknown
speaker
or
people
who
sell
music.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
most,
if
i
hear
you,
that
you
could
really
insist
on
is
that
we
ought
to
have
a
mini-trial
first
to
see
whether
the
rule
of
reason
applies,
or
whether
it
is
per
se.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
an
entire
antitrust
trial
on
the
assumption
that
the
rule
of
reason
was
going
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
it.
under
the
argument
you
are
now
making,
you
should
have
no
more
than
a
chance
to
put
whatever
evidence
in
that
might
be
useful
in
deciding
whether
this
is
per
se
illegal
price
fixing.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
a
district
judge
has
discretion
in
the
timing
of
his
decision
as
to
whether
to
grant
or
deny
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment?
