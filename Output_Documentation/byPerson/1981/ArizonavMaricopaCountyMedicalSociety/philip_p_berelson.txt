mr.
philip
p.
berelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
summary
judgment
case,
and
because
of
that
i
am
going
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
talking
about
the
facts
and
the
lack
of
facts
that
are
undisputed
and
are
in
the
record.
first,
i
would
point
out
that
respondents
have
submitted
a
statement
of
material
facts
in
issue
precluding
summary
judgment.
it
is
found
in
the
appendix,
at
page
123,
and
i
think
it
deals
with
many
of
the
issues
which
i
am
going
to
discuss.
most
important,
there
is
no
fee
schedule,
no
fee
schedule
as
petitioner
and
as
the
united
states
have
used
that
term
today.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
is
no
agreement
concerning
what
doctors
charge
patients,
and
the
district
court
so
ruled,
and
that
is
right
in
its
opinion.
what
the
petitioner
is
calling
a
fee
schedule
is
really
an
agreement
by
members
of
a
medical
foundation
which
only
affects
medical
foundation
endorsed
insurance,
and
it
is
an
agreement
to
accept
the
maximum
reimbursement
levels
as
payment
in
full
in
the
event
that
the
doctor
bills
the
patient
more
than
that
maximum
reimbursement
level
and
the
patient
is
medical
foundation
insured.
then
the
doctor
will
write
off
the
difference.
if
the
doctor
is
not
a
member
of
the
foundation,
then
the
doctor
is
free
to
charge
the
difference
to
the
patient.
this
is
accompanied
by
agreements
by
the
members
of
the
foundation
to
be
bound
by
peer
review,
not
to
use
the
foundation
to
change
the
rates
they
bill
their
patients,
not
to
discriminate
in
billing
between
foundation
insured
and
non-insured
patients,
and
it
has
absolutely
no
effect
whatsoever
without
the
additional
component
of
an
insurer
voluntarily
agreeing
to
participate
in
the
program,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
is
any
ability
to
coerce
insurers
to
participate.
indeed,
the
record
is
absolutely
empty
as
to
what
the
insurers
really
do
in
the
market.
all
we
can
say,
and
this
is
very
limited,
is
that
in
1979
maricopa
foundation,
one
of
the
respondents,
insured
about
1,000
people
out
of
a
population
of
1.5
million
in
maricopa
county,
about
7
percent,
and
in
1978,
pima
foundation
covered
about
6,000
people,
or
about
1
percent
of
the
population
of
pima
county,
and
in
that
same
year,
only
31
percent
of
the
physicians
in
pima
county
were
members
of
pima
foundation.
so,
it
is
not
an
organization
which
exercises
any
sort
of
dominance
over
delivery
of
medical
care
in
the
two
areas
where
the
respondents
are
operating.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
there
is
none.
there
is
no
showing...
since
it
is
summary
judgment
there
would
have
to
be
undisputed
facts.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
there
are
no
undisputed
facts
showing
any
connection
other
than
that
the
pima
foundation
acted
as
an
agent
for
the
maricopa
foundation
for
maricopa
foundation
endorsed
plans
when
the
patient
happened
to
be
in
pima
county.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
they
are
entirely
separate
organizations.
they
are
separate,
and
maricopa
foundation
does
not
participate
in
running
of
pima,
and
pima
does
not
participate
in
running
of
maricopa.
and
the
record
shows
that
their
reimbursement
schedules
were
different.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that
is
right.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
there
are
allegations
about
an
overall
conspiracy
throughout
the
state,
but
that
has
never
been
proved,
and
that
is
something
that
would
certainly
be
disputed.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
at
this
stage--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
decision
left
that
open.
it
is
possible.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
i
am
asking
the
court
to
rule
that
on
this
state
of
the
record,
the
rule
of
reason
must
be
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
violation
that
will
entitle
the
petitioner
to
summary
judgment,
but
when
we
have
a
trial,
then
we
will
have
a
full
record,
we
will
know
the
context,
we
will
know
the
marketplace,
we
will
have
the
experience
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
there
is
the
type
of
conduct
that
could
in
the
future
be
characterized
as
per
se--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--we
contend
that
when
all
the
evidence
is
in,
we
will
win.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
but
if
we
assume
that
the
petitioner's
facts
were
correct,
then
after
you
had
the
full
evidentiary
hearing
and
were
able
to
determine
whether
the
facts
that
we
are
putting
forth
are
indeed
the
correct
facts
or
not
the
correct
facts,
the
court
may
disagree
with
us,
and
it
may
say
this
is
a
per
se
violation.
we
don't
think
that
will
happen
on
the
facts
as
they
are
developed.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
i
am
saying--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--i
am
saying
that
in
this
particular
case
you
have
to
reverse
and
remand
for
a
trial
and
at
the
trial
when
the
evidence
is
in
the
judge
will
be
able
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
rule
of
reason
should
apply.
he
won't
know
until
be
knows
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that's
right.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
supporting
the
petitioner's
claim
that
the
maximum
reimbursement
rates
of
the
medical
foundation
result
in
physicians'
revising
prices
upward,
because
there
is
very
little
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
pricing
takes
place
in
maricopa
or
pima
counties
at
all.
what
we
do
know
from
the
record
is
that
the
maricopa
foundation
maximum
reimbursement
rates
have
lagged
well
behind
the
rate
of
increase
of
medical
fees
and
the
rate
of
increase
of
inflation
both
for
medical
and
for
general
cost
of
living,
both
national
and--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--that
is
right,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
is
that
what
the
petitioner
claims
are
undisputed
facts
are
not
facts
at
all.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
what
we
are
saying
is
that
unless
the
petitioner
can
demonstrate
an
effect
on
price
in
the
marketplace
which
it
has
chosen,
that
there
can't
be
a
per
se
violation.
they
have
failed
to
do
that.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
there
have
been
increases.
it
has
not
been
each
year.
put
what--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--it
happens...
i
think
there
have
been
five
prior
to
the
time
that
the
lawsuit
was...
prior
to
the
summary
judgment
motion,
and--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--five
increases,
and
if
you
look
at
appendix--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--since...
i
believe
that
is
from
1971
in
the
case
of
the
maricopa
foundation,
but
i
may
be
wrong
on
that
year.
the
appendix
c
to
our
brief
shows
the
amount
of
the
increases
in
the
reimbursement
levels
of
the
maricopa
foundation,
and
he
compares
it
against
published
statistics
on
the
rate
of
increase
of
medical
fees
in
maricopa
county
and
nationwide,
and
shows
that
the
rate
is
less
for
the
maximum
reimbursement
levels,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
contention
that
we
intend
to
prove
at
trial
that
the
medical
foundation
is
a
mechanism
for
holding
down
costs,
and
it
is
the
cost
to
the
insurer
of
providing
the
medical
care
that
the
insurer
has
contracted
to
indemnity.
i
would
like
to
explain
how
that
works.
you
have
to
look
at
the
three
groups
that
are
interested
here.
it
was
an
observation
from
the
court
which
is
quite
true
that
there
is
a
tripartite
situation.
you
have
the
patients.
what
does
the
patient
want?
a
patient
wants
a
commitment
from
his
insurer
to
pay
the
medical
bills.
the
patient
does
not
want
to
have
to
pay
a
difference
between
what
the
insurance
covers
and
what
the
doctor
bills.
he
wants
the
insurance
to
cover
the
medical
procedures
which
are
necessary,
not
to
be
told
that
he
can't
have
the
procedure
because
he
can't
afford
it
and
it
is
not
covered.
he
wants
the
best
quality
of
care.
he
wants
to
choose
the
doctor
who
will
give
the
care.
and
he
wants
the
insurance
cost
to
be
as
low
as
possible,
consistent
with
delivering
the
other
things
that
he
wants.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
they
agree
that
that
is
true
if
the
patient
is
covered
by--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--by
the
foundation
insurance,
and
if
the
doctor
has
become
a
foundation
member.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
and
the
record
shows
that--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--no,
it
is
an
agreement
establishing
that
the
patient
pays
nothing,
the
insurer
pays--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--exactly.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
exactly.
the
maximum
the
insurer
has
to
pay--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--no,
because
it's
an
agreement
to
make
a
proposal
to
insurance
companies,
which
they
are
free
to
accept
or
reject.
it
doesn't
fix
anything.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that's
right.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
exactly,
and
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
the
doctor
does
not
know,
because
he
doesn't
have
circulated
to
him
a
listing
in
advance
as
to
what
those
are
going
to
be.
he
is
supposed
to
charge
all
his
patients
the
way
he
ordinarily
charges
them,
and
when
the
patient
happens
to
be
foundation
insured,
the
foundation
will
pay
the
claim,
and
if
the
bill
was
more
than
what
the
maximum
reimbursement
level
is,
the
doctor
is
informed
of
this,
and
then
he
has
to
write
off
the
difference.
now,
let's
look
at
what
the
insurer
would
like.
the
insurer
would
like
to
keep
down
the
cost
of
the
medical
care
that
it
is
obligated
to
indemnify
the
patient
for.
that
means
minimizing
the
payments
for
the
treatment
that
must
be
given,
avoiding
unnecessary
treatment,
and
the
insurer
can
also
lower
the
cost
by
limiting
the
extent
o
the
coverage
of
the
insurance,
by
excluding
coverage
of
certain
procedures
or
certain
types
of
illnesses.
the
insurer
would
like
to
accurately
predict
the
costs
of
medical
care
because
that
enables
the
insurer
to
make
better
actuarial
predictions,
which
means
that
it
can
lower
its
rates
because
it
doesn't
have
to
have
a
reserve
to
cover
the
unexpected,
and
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
a
big
element
in
that
unexpected
is
usually
inflation,
and
the
possibility
of
increases
in
the
costs
of
medical
services
which
you
can't
tell
in
advance.
you
are
writing
insurance
that
covers
a
period
of
time.
you
don't
know
what
the
cost
of
a
particular
procedure
is
going
to
be
a
year
from
now
in
the
community.
the
insurer
needs
a
mechanism
to
negotiate
cost
containment.
he
needs
one
which
is
inexpensive
and
administratively
feasible.
he
cannot
go
out
and
send
his
agents
to
negotiate
individually
with
every
one
of
the
doctors
in
the
community.
in
the
record
we
see
a
number
of
1,700
in
maricopa
county,
and
keep
in
mind
that
you
are
talking
about
a
number
of
insurers
who
do
business
in
maricopa
county,
although
the
number
is
not
defined
in
the
record.
but
if
we
assume
that
it
is
even
50,
if
you
have
50
insurers
each
trying
to
negotiate
with
1,700
doctors,
you
can
see
the
administrative
nightmare
that
you
get.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
blue
cross
does
sometimes,
but
sometimes
blue
cross
runs
a
foundation
endorsed
medical
plan,
so--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--yes.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
well,
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--yes,
but
the
same
thing
happens
here.
the
individual
doctors
sign
up
with
the
medical
foundation.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
the
same
thing
happens
here.
the
maricopa
foundation--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--not
at
all.
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
medical
foundation--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--the
agreement
is
not
among
the
doctors.
it
is
between
the
doctor
and
the
medical
foundation
that
the
doctor
will
accept
the
medical
foundation
maximum
payment--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--no,
the
doctor
charges
his
usual
fee,
but
is
paid
by
the
insurance
some
amount
which
may
be
less,
and
if
it
is
less,
he
writes
off
the
difference.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
he
collects
nothing
from...
he
has
agreed
to
collect
nothing
from
the
customer,
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
deductible.
it
becomes
a
transaction
entirely
between
the
doctor
and
the
insurer
and
the
patient
is
out
of
it.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
well,
that
is
right.
it
is
not
the
type
of
operation
that
blue
cross
runs,
and
that
is
why
you
have
to
have
a
factual
understanding
of
what
it
does
do
in
order
to
understand
that
it
is
a
cost
containment
mechanism.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that
is
right.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
the
medical
foundation
does
the
same
thing
in
this
arrangement
that
blue
cross
does
in
its
plans.
blue
cross
sets
a
standard
as
to
what
the
reimbursement
will
be
on
a
blue
cross
plan.
the
doctor
accepts
it
or
rejects
it.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
exactly.
the
same
thing
happens
here,
your
honor.
what
happens
here
is,
the
medical
foundation
offers
the
doctor
the
opportunity
to
either
individually
accept
or
reject
membership
in
the
foundation,
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
of
many
doctors
who
feel
that
the
maximum
reimbursements
are
too
low,
and
they
reject
it.
nobody
is
forced
to
join
the
foundation.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
the
trustees
are
members
of
the
medical
profession
elected
by
the
membership.
now,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
a
study
performed
by
mr.
william
link
which
was
published
in
the
journal
of
law
and
economics,
and
the
important
point
of
that
study
is
that
the
empirical
evidence
and
the
theory
behind
it
demonstrates
that
when
members
of
the
medical
profession
perform
this
function
of
proposing
a
maximum
reimbursement
level,
empirically,
the
result
is
that
you
get
a
lower
level,
and
you
get
more
doctors
agreeing
to
accept
it
as
payment
in
full.
that
is
the
evidence
that
we
would
put
in
at
trial
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
pro-competitive
cost
containment
device,
and
that
there
is
no
effect
on
the
fee
that
the
patient
pays.
there
is
an
effect
in
that
the
cost
of
the
insurance
that
he
buys
may
be
lower,
and
that
is
good.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
any
insurance
company
can
offer
a
foundation
endorsed
plan.
all
they
have
to
do
is
agree
to
the
minimum
standards
of
the
foundation,
and
if
they
agree
that
the
plan
will
meet
those
minimum
standards,
it
becomes
a
foundation
endorsed
plan.
you
can
have
two
insurers
competing
for
the
same
business
with
the
foundation
with
different--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--no.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
there
is
no
limit
on
what
the
insurer
charges
for
the
insurance.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that
is
right.
the
rate
which
has
been
proposed
by
the
medical
foundation.
but
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
insurer
does
not
have
to
accept
that
proposal.
if
the
insurer
can
do
better
on
its
own,
if
the
insurer
can
negotiate
with
doctors
a
lower
reimbursement
rate,
there
is
nothing
to
stop
it
from
doing
that.
what
i
am
suggesting
to
you
is
that
as
a
empirical
matter,
which
we
can
prove
at
trial,
if
given
the
opportunity,
they
are
not
going
to
get
in
the
marketplace
a
better
deal
than
they
will
get
with
the
medical
foundation.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
that
is
not
what
it
is
at
all,
because
they
haven't
agreed
on
a
price.
they
have
agreed
on
a
proposal
that
anybody
can
accept
or
reject,
and
if
it
is
rejected,
it
is
not
the
price.
the
price
is
what
they
would
ordinarily
charge.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
it
has
been
rejected,
because
only
7
percent
of
the
people
in
maricopa
county
are
insured
under
this.
the
other
93
have
rejected
it.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
no,
that
number
just
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
number
that
is
important
is
that
for
the
people
who
have
been
insured,
the
foundation
can
show
for
maricopa
county
a
saving
of
$8
million
compared
to
what
the
medical
fees
would
have
been.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
it
is
$8
million
aggregate
from
the
start
of
the
foundation.
there
is
no
number
in
the
record
for
any
particular
year.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
is
1968
or
1971.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
okay.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
there
is
nothing
in--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--there
are
undoubtedly
millions
of
dollars
paid
out
through
this
mechanism.
no
doubt
about
it.
now,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
mechanism
reduces
that
cost
without--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--without
doing
anything
to
demonstrably
affect
the
price
that
a
patient
is
being
billed
by
his
physician.
if
the
patient
doesn't
use
the
foundation,
there
is
no
effect
from
the
foundation.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
the
rates
would
be
different,
no
higher.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
right,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
rate
that
the
doctor
charges
the
patient,
because
that
is
the
marketplace
which
the
petitioner
is
claiming
a
monopoly
or
price
fixing
in.
the
only
effect
on
price
is
the
cost
to
the
insurer.
that
is
the
effect
of
the
medical
foundation.
petitioner
complains
that
this
is
price
fixing
on
what
the
patient
is
charged.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that.
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
fixes
the
price
that
the
insurer
must
pay.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
tha
is
right,
and
let
me
explain
why--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--that's
right,
and
it
does
work
to
the
extent
that
some--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--no,
it
is
a
very
useful
thing
to
do,
and
the
reason--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--and
also
because
it
enables
the
patient
to
get
a
product
he
couldn't
get
otherwise,
because
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
type
of
insurance
that
will
cover
the
entire
cost
of
medical
care
and
not
have
the
patient
pay
the
difference
between
a
maximum
and
what
the
billing
is
is
to
have
some
type
of
operation
such
as
this.
somebody
has
got
to
get
doctors
to
agree
to
accept
the
maximum
paid
by
the
insurance
as
payment
in
full.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes,
it
reduces
the
costs--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--the
costs
of
insurance--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--there
is
a
free
market.
it
is
an
alternative
in
that
free
market
that--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--that's
right,
because
the
arrangement
gives
you
something
different
than
the
individual
doctors
could
offer,
and
in
that
way
it
is
like,
the
broadcast
music
case,
because
what
you
have
is
something
that--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--yes.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
because
there
is
no
agreement
that
is
maintaining
prices.
we
are
giving
people
an
option.
there
is
a
proposal
that
is
out
there.
if
they
accept
it,
the
cost
to
the
insurer
is
lower.
if
they
don't
accept
it,
maybe
the
insurer
can
do
better
on
its
own.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
we
have
to
explore
that.
i
am
suggesting
that
authorities,
secondary
authorities
that
we
can
look
at
and
which,
even
though
they
are
not
in
the
record,
support
our
contention,
that
we
can
prove
this
at
trial.
it
is
the
conflict
between
the
doctor's
goals,
the
insurer's
goals,
and
the
patient's
goals
that
inflict
a
market
force
on
medical
foundations
and
prevent
them
from
fixing
a
price
at
whatever
they
want.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
absolutely.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that
is
right.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
about
7
percent
of
the
people
in
the
county--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--have
this
type
of
insurance
in
1978,
i
believe.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
i
don't
think
we
can
tell
from
the
record
we
have
now.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes,
yes.
i
would
think
so.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
sure,
because
the
way
the
foundation--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--that's
right,
and
the
patient
gets
the
same
amount
paid
to
the
doctor
whether
the
doctor
is
a
foundation
member
or
not.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
effect
that
would
coerce
doctors
to
join
the
foundation,
coerce
patients
to
use
foundation
doctors,
coerce
insurers
to
use
foundation
insurance.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that
is
exactly
what
happens,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
the
difference
in
that
situation
is,
the
patient
never
knows
in
advance
whether
what
the
insurance
pays
will
cover
what
the
doctor
bills.
if
he
is
a
member
of
a
foundation
plan,
and
if
the
doctor
is
a
foundation
doctor,
then
he
knows
in
advance
that
whatever
it
costs,
the
foundation
insurance
will
pay
the
entire
bill,
and
he
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
the
difference.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
that
is
the
benefit
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
patient,
and
that
is
why
doctors
who
are
engaged
in
independent
practices
have
an
incentive
to
join
a
medical
foundation,
because
this
enables
them
to
offer
something
to
the
patient
which
looks
to
the
patient
like
an
hmo.
an
hmo
does
the
same
thing
in
the
sense
that
for
a
fixed
amount
of
money
paid
for
hmo,
you
get
all
the
medical
care
that
you
need.
a
doctor
in
private
practice
couldn't
do
that
by
himself.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
the
only
evidence--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--yes,
there
is
evidence.
one
of
the
affidavits
points
out
that
a
number
of
doctors
have
refused
to
join
because
they
feel
that
the
maximum
reimbursements
are
so
low
that
they
are
unfair
and
they
just
can't
accept
them.
that
is
the
only
evidence
that
i
am
aware
of
in
the
record
with
respect
to
non-members.
we
have
urged
that
there
is
no
showing
that
people
are
coerced
to
do
this.
people
are
free
to
do
it
or
not,
and
therefore,
the
market
forces
come
into
play.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
well,
that
is
a
concept
that
was
introduced
in
the
reply
brief
by
the
petitioner,
but
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
from
the
economic--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--that's
right.
nothing
in
the
record.
you
have
to
go
back
and
get
evidence
in
order
to
see
whether
that
had
anything
to
it
or
not.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
foundation
is
structured
so
that
market
forces
do
come
into
play.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
what
they
are
saying,
and
we
show--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--that
is
what
i
would
like
to
know,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
if
that
is
their
position,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it,
and
it
is
not
the
basis
for
summary
judgment.
yes,
that
may
well
be
what
they
ultimately
intend
to
show.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes.
we--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--well,
but
the
record
does
show
that
when
the
fostered
chosen
care
plan
for
arizona
went
from
the
maricopa
foundation
reimbursement
schedule
to
a
different
one,
the
state
paid
more
money
for
the
same
medical
services.
why
did
they
do
that?
i
submit
it
makes
no
sense
at
all.
they
did
it
because
they
thought
that
what
maricopa
foundation
was
doing
was
not
legal,
and
therefore
they
didn't
want
to
participate
in
it.
but
what
we
would
like
is
an
opportunity
to
show
that
it
is
legal,
it
saves
costs
of
insurance,
it
lowers
insurance
costs.
the
market
forces
control
what
the
maximum
reimbursement
rates
can
be.
if
the
rates
get
too
high,
insurers
will
not
write
maricopa
foundation
or
any
medical
foundation
insurance.
they
will
set
their
own
reimbursement
levels
that
are
lower.
if
the
rates
are
too
low,
the
doctors
just
won't
renew
their
membership
in
the
foundation.
unless
you
have
broad
coverage,
a
large
number
of
doctors
participating,
you
don't
get
the
attraction
of
a
lot
of
physicians
who
will
accept
payment
as
payment
in
full.
so,
that
will
cause
the
rates
to
go
up.
you
hit
an
equilibrium
which
according
to
the
link
study
is
going
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
average
or
median
charge
in
the
community.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes,
there
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
action
arose
out
of
an
investigation
that
was
supposedly
under
the
state
antitrust
law.
they
took
depositions.
they
had
a
crd
type
procedure.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
there
is
a
pendent
state
claim.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
in
the
federal
action,
which
was
not
the
basis
for
the
summary
judgment
motion
which
you
have
before
you
today,
but
it
is
there.
the
state
law
is
the
uniform
state
antitrust
law,
which
is
very
similar
to
the
sherman
act.
indeed,
it
says
that
you
look
at
the
sherman
act
precedents.
in
the
opposition
to
the
summary
judgment
motion,
the
medical
foundations
have
argued
that
the
maximum
reimbursement
levels
are
essential
to
the
concept
and
operation
of
medical
foundation
endorsed
insurance.
w
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
produce
the
evidence
and
present
it
at
a
hearing
to
determine
that.
the
situation
is
very
similar
to
the
type
of
activity
that
the
court
sanctioned
in
the
broadcast
music
case.
you
have
the
creation
of
a
new
product,
different
from
what
any
individual
doctor
could
offer
by
himself.
what
happens
is,
you
get
full
coverage
insurance,
which
pays
medical
costs
in
full,
and
a
peer
review
to
avoid
unnecessary
procedures.
the
medical
foundation
does
put
the
doctor
at
risk,
and
the
evidence
of
that
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
309.
the
doctor
is
not
compensated
for
any
additional
complexity
or
difficulty
in
treatment.
if
he
would
charge
more
than
the
maximum
reimbursement
level
because
of
complexity
or
difficulty,
it
is
too
bad,
if
he
is
dealing
with
a
maricopa
foundation
patient
and
he
is
a
maricopa
foundation
member.
he
has
to
write
it
off.
if
he
performs
a
treatment
which
he
in
good
faith
believes
is
medically
necessary,
and
peer
review
of
the
medical
foundation
disagrees
with
him,
he
is
at
risk
for
that.
he
has
to
write
it
off
and
accept
their
judgment.
if
the
costs
of
medical
services
that
he
must
buy,
if
his
costs
of
supplies
and
help
go
up
because
of
inflation,
he
can't
increase
what
he
receives
on
the
maricopa
foundation
patients.
he
is
locked
in
for
a
year
by
his
membership.
and
at
the
end
of
the
year,
he
may
decide
not
to
renew,
but
at
least
for
that
one
year
he
is
at
risk
for
the
costs
and
the
inflation
factor.
the
medical
foundation
reduces
the
transaction
costs.
it
enormously
simplifies
the
negotiations
between
insurers
and
physicians.
it
limits
the
complexity
of
establishing
understandable
maximum
reimbursement
levels
which
can
be
administratively
handled
in
payments.
it
lowers
the
cost
and
complexity
of
claim
processing,
and
one
of
the
functions
that
the
medical
foundations
perform
is
the
claims
processing
function
for
the
insurers
if
the
insurer
desires
them
to
do
that.
all
of
these
things
make
a
medical
foundation
the
same
type
of
pro-competitive
activity
that
the
court
sanctioned
in
the
broadcast
music
case.
it
doesn't
affect
the
prices
that
the
individual
doctors
charge
individually.
it
only
affects
the
prices
that
somebody
can
agree
to
accept
by
agreeing
to
maricopa
foundation
or
pima
foundation
endorsed
coverage.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
appendix
c
in
the
back
of
the
respondents'
brief.
it
is
all--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--yes,
it
is
right
at
the
back
of
the
brief,
the
very
last
pages.
you
can
see
there--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--just
turn
to
the
back,
right
inside
the
back
cover.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
and
you
can
see
that
the
rate
of
increase
and
the
average
annual
change
is
less
than
any
of
the
other
numbers
there
which
are
there
for
purposes
of
comparison,
the
national
index
for
medical
care,
the
consumer
price
index
for
physician
services,
the
metropolitan
phoenix
medical
care
index.
whether
or
not
the
same
result
could
be
accomplished
in
a
less
restrictive
way
is
something
that
is
in
dispute,
obviously,
listening
to
petitioner's
argument
and
respondents',
and
that
in
itself
shows
that
this
is
not
a
case
that
is
ripe
for
summary
judgment
at
this
time.
we
need
to
know
more.
we
need
to
know
enough
about
the
industry
in
which
this
happened.
we
need
to
know
about
what
the
effects
of
this
are.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
well,
the
legal
issue
is
whether
you
are
going
to
characterize
that
as
price
fixing,
and
what
i
am
suggesting
to
you
is
that
the
evidence
that
is
in
this
record
does
not
enable
you
to
make
that
characterization.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
because
we
are
talking
about
different
prices
for
different
things.
we
are
talking
about
a
comparison
between
what
doctors
bill
patients
and
what
insurers
pay
for
the
services
that
they
have
agreed
to
provide
to
their
insureds.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
they
are
relevant
because
they
show
that--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--well,
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
same
way
that
the
court
analyzed
the
broadcast
music
agreement.
are
you
creating
something
that
is
different?
in
broadcast
music--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--that's
right.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
no,
we
are
saying
it
is
good
because
it
offers
a
different
product
than
the
individual
doctors
offer.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes,
but
they--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--they
agree
that
they
will
not
have
the
patient
at
risk
for
the
difference--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--between
what
his
insurance
i
and
what
the
bill
is.
it
is
a
very
important
difference
if
you
happen
to
be
a
patient
and
you
don't
have
that
type
of
insurance
coverage,
and
it
is
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
you
have
in
broadcast
music,
because
you
also
have
the
alternative,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
contradict
that
everybody
has
the
alternative
of
doing
it
individually,
unilaterally,
and
that
the
pricing
of
that
transaction
is
not
affected
in
any
way
by
the
operation
of
this
particular
entity
which
is
giving
you
a
new
type
service,
a
new
type
of
product,
and
that
is
the
important--
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
--the
fact
that
it
is
doctors
in
the
medical
profession
suggests
that
we
have
to
know
more
in
order
to
see
whether
doctors
in
the
medical
profession
should
be
treated
like
people
who
sell
iron
pipe
or
people
who
sell
gasoline.
i
suggest
that
you
don't
treat
them
the
same
because
the
considerations
are
different.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
excuse
me?
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
or
people
who
sell
music.
the
considerations
are
different.
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
considerations
can
be
different.
we
have
to
have
a
full
record
to
see
whether
in
fact
they
are
different,
and
until
you
know
that,
you
can't
condemn
this,
or
you
shouldn't
condemn
this.
furthermore,
it
would
be
unfair
to
have
summary
judgment
granted
before
the
respondents
have
had
an
opportunity
to
put
in
the
record
the
evidence
that
they
claim
shows
pro-competitive
aspects
and
the
lack
of
affect
on
price
of
this
particular
conduct.
we
haven't
had
that
opportunity.
i
have
alluded
to
the
pro-complaint
discovery
that
the
petitioners
had.
because
of
the
way
this
case
came
through
procedurally,
we
just
haven't
had
discovery
on
who
is
in
the
market,
how
they
price,
whether
there
is
any
effect
all
on
their
prices.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
it
would
be
something
like
what
happened
in
the
society
of
professional
engineers
case,
in
which
you
developed
a
full
record.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
it
would
depend
upon
whether
the
judge
thought
that
would
be
the
most
expeditious
way.
he
could
have
the
full
trial
and
then
during
the
course
of
the
trial
make
that
determination.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
yes,
and
unless
the
petitioner
was
able
to
put
in
undisputed
facts
to
show
that
it
was
per
se,
then
they
cannot
prevail
on
a
per
se
theory
and
you
do
have
to
have
that
trial.
mr.
philip
p.
berelson
i
think
a
district
judge
does,
but
that
the
discretion
has
to
take
into
account
the
experience
and
the
theory
and
whether
the
precedents
which
deal
with
per
se
liability
on
price
fixing
are
applicable
and
appropriate
in
this
particular
type
of
marketplace
on
the
particular
facts
that
are
set
forth.
in
this
case,
the
district
court,
if
he
has
discretion,
exercised
it
wisely,
we
believe,
and
we
are
just
asking
you
to
uphold
that
and
to
allow
the
proceedings
to
go
back
to
their
normal
course,
have
discovery,
and
have
a
determination
after
appropriate
discovery
and
after
a
full
record.
thank
you.
