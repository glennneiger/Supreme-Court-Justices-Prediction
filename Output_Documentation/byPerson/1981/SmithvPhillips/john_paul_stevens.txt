mr.
pitler,
right
on
that
point,
who
mailed
the
letter
into
the
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather
unusual
way
to
apply
for
a
job,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
had
a
man
working
for
the
prosecutor
and
mail
the
letter
to
the
prosecutor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
fontaine
work
in
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
worked
in
the
district
attorney's
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
misunderstood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
worked
for
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
he
have
--
did
fontaine
have
further
conversation
with
people
under
the
prosecutor's
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
who
told
the
trial
--
trial
prosecutor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pitler,
under
that
rule
in
new
york,
suppose
you
have
a
juror
who
had
been
the
victim
of
armed
robbery
and
then
he
was
called
as
juror
on
an
armed
robbery
case.
he
did
disclose
the
fact
that
he
had
been
himself
a
victim
of
an
armed
robbery.
would
your
procedure
acquire
a
determination
of
actual
bias
in
that
case?
no
implied
bias?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
just
didn't
disclose
it,
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
questions
asked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
would
or
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
--
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
the
prosecutor
never
known
about
this
until
after
the
trial?
suppose
no
one
--
no
one
--
none
of
the
--
now
of
the
prosecuting
staff,
anything
about
this
said
until
after
the
trial
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
possibility
of
bias
was
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
question,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
your
view
was.
if
that
hearing
had
been
conducted
during
the
minutes
of
the
trial
and
the
judge
had
found
the
facts
the
way
it
did.
do
you
think
he
would
have
let
the
trial
go
forward
without
replacing
a
juror?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
but
you
don't
know
whether
he
would
have
construed
new
york
law,
nevertheless
to
authorize
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
other
juror?
they
did
tell
the
judge
about
the
other
juror?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
think
the
possibility
of
talking
to
the
judge
occurred
to
them
when
they
met
outside
then?
