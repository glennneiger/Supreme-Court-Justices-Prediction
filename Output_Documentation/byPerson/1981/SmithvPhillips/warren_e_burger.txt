as
the
second
circuit
holding
amount
to
reading
the
word
“may”
in

where
the
provision
is
the
court
may,
in
the
circumstances,
may
if
an
alternate

is
available
to
discharge
the
juror.
it
is
the
second
circuit
in
your
view
reading

as
the
court
must.
chief

warren
e.
burger
that's
exactly
the
second
circuit
holding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
they
make
that
pretty
plain
in
the
closing
pages
of
their
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
pretty
important
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
what
the
defense
counsel
is
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
--
if
--
are
you
suggesting
that
if
both
counsel
did
not
consent,
he
would
not
have
--
on
the
basis
of
his
statements,
he
would
not
have
disqualified

juror?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
fair
reading
his
own
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
kunstler.
chief
justice
warren
e.

judge
find
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
did
he
find
about
the
consequence
of
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
be
bias?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
finding
of
no
actual
bias
make
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
next
question
you're
suggesting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
per
se
--
you
mean
a
per
se
bias
from
the
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that's
a
little
more
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
little
more
than
an
implied
bias
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
need
any
implication
if
there's
a
per
se
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
--
do
you
usually
mean
it
and
every
other
context
where
the
phrase
is
used?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
that
problem
take
care
of
itself
in
the
majority
selection
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
take
care
of
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
be
just
--
you
mean,
if
he
disclosed
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
they
work?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
square
that
--
how
do
you
square
that
with
what
this
court
said
in
witherspoon
that
you
can
be
against,
you
can
have
contentious
objections
against
the
capital
punishment
but
you
can
still
sit
on
the
jury.
chief

warren
e.

yes.

warren
e.
burger
--
in
your
part.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
your
psychoanalysis,
or
