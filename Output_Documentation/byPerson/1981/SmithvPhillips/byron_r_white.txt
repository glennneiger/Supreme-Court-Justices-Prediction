justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
fact
took
a
per
se
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
judge
pierce
implied
bias
was
not
the
same?
you
think
it's
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
--
when
did
the
trial
prosecutor
learned
of
that
letter?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
time,
do
i
understand
that
there
were
several
alternates?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
this
been
brought
to
the
attention
under
the
trial
judge?
had
the
trial
prosecutor
told
him
about
it?
i
take
that
an
alternate
could
have
been
substituted.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
he
would
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
he
might
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
really
the
key
fact
in
this
whole
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
find
that
the
second
circuit
agrees
thought
that
is
a
matter
of
a
federal
constitution
that
--
that
situation
does
not
require
a
determination
of
actual
bias,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
event,
surely,
the
second
circuit
did
not
follow
as
you
have
now
described
it
to
new
york
law,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
do
you
understand
that?
what
do
you
--
how
does
that
differ
do
you
think
if
he
does
if
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you
think
they
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
surely,
i
thought
there
was
a
difference
between
how
you
construe
the
new
york
rule
and
the
way
the
second
circuit
looked
at
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
surely,
the
standard
applied
by
the
second
circuit
is
different
from
the
one
that
you
suggest
as
the
new
york
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
say,
and
we
reverse
because
we
think
that
fact
circumstance
establishes
a
violation
to
the
federal
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
that
they
even
trust
him,
whether
he
was
in
fact
biased.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
say
just
as
a
matter
of
per
se,
that
conduct
per
se
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
know
the
knowledge
of
the
prosecutor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
his
failure
to
disclose
it
for
the
trial
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
do
get
a
reversal.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
the
case
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
terms
of
the
possibility
of
bias,
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
whether
the
prosecutor
knew
about
it
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
the
second
circuit
would
come
out
the
same
way
if
the
prosecutors
had
found
out
about
it
or
told
the
judge
about
it,
the
judge
that
held
the
hearing
at
that
very
moment
and
come
out
just
as
he
did
in
the
hearing
here,
and
then
refused
to
remove
the
juror.
do
you
think
then
the
second
circuit
would
not
--
would
--
would
not
have
set
the
conviction
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
well
i
--
can
it
be
true
about
the
second
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
matter.
i
didn't
mean
to
ask
for
--
to
ask
for
prediction
of
the
second
--
what
the
second
circuit
would
do.
i
just
wonder
how
you
read
their
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
rule
--
what's
--
what's
the
ruling
of
the
cases
in
this
court
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
possible
bias
of
the
juror?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
--
did
the
--
did
the
prosecutor
who
was
trying
the
case
and
learned
about
this,
testified?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it
--
what
where
they
--
what
was
their
explanation
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
not
telling
the
--
for
not
telling
the
judge
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
what
--
if
--
if
--
if
they
testified,
why
they
didn't
reveal
what
they
learned
with
the
judge
in
the
middle
of
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
just
--
he
just
admitted
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
no
--
he
--
he
disaffirmed,
he
disavowed
any
tactical
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
--
you
know,
the
judge
seemed
to
have
--
i
believe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
is
--
who
do
you
--
you
distinguished
during
the
prosecutors
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
who's
trying
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
the
--
the
assistant
--
the
assistant
district
attorneys
weren't
trying
the
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
--
is
it
those
two
prosecutors
who
met
and
decided
not
to
deal
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
believe
the
two
that
you
--
that
were
--
and
they
testified.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they're
the
two
who
said
their
minds
were
so
full
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
who
is
mr.
litman?
is
he
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
prosecutors
actually
met
and
made
a
deliberate
decision
about
this,
this
isn't
--
it
wasn't
in
the
middle
of
cross-examination
is
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
they
made
any
knowing
decision
not
to
tell
their
superiors
are
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
it
--
but
certainly
it
was
a
failure
to,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kunster,
how
would
a
--
what
are
the
possibilities
of
biasing
the
jury
if
he
files
this
application
for
a
job?
what
are
the
possibilities
of
--
of
his
becoming
bias
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
the
possibilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
(inaudible)
to
convict
in
order
to
get
a
job
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
--
and
if
he
innocently
file
that
as
a
claim
is,
it
--
it
maybe
--
he
might
--
he
might
have
been
--
he
certainly
would
have
thought
or
the
argument
is
that
he
would
have
been
less
--
he
would
have
thought
it
would
hurt
his
chances
to
get
the
job
if
he
voted
to
quit,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
right
about
that,
then
if
it
did
come
up
on
voir
dire,
it
wouldn't
have
been
amazing,
you
would
have
said
that
you
--
you
had
a
challenge
for
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
don't
you
have
to
take
that
position
at
this
--
at?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
--
how
many
judges
refused
to
set
this
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
--
how
many
judges
refused
to
set
this
aside
after
this
post-trial
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
a
--
a
fellow
--
the
judge
who
held
the
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
would
be
one
out
of
your
1000?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
and
the
appellate
--
the
appellate
division?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
--
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
thank
you.
