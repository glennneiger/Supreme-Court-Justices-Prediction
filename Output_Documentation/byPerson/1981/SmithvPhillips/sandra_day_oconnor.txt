mr.
pitler,
do
you
think
there
was
role
for
a
rule
of
implied
bias
under
some
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
the
proceedings
in
new
york
for
finding
out
after
the
fact
how
a
particular
juror
voted?
does
the
juror
have
to
disclose
how
he
voted
assuming
it
were
a
hung
jury
or
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doesn't
that
militate
against
then
finding
implied
bias
for
a
juror
who
has
a
job
application
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
might
not
that
person
feel
that
nobody
would
know
or
be
entitled
to
know,
so
it
wouldn't
matter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wonder
whether
that
fact
doesn't
militate
against
finding
implied
bias.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
allege
that
the
post-trial
hearing
which
was
held
was
anything
but
fair,
do
you?
