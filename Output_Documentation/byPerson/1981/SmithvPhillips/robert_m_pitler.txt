mr.
robert
m.
pitler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
federal
habeas
corpus
has
been
granted
to
a
state
prisoner
and
causes
a
so-called
reprehensible
prosecutorial
error
even
though
an
--
an
analysis
of
the
case
demonstrates
that
this
error
is
not
prejudicially
accused.
thus,
the
issue
that
is
presented
here
is
whether
this
prosecutorial
conduct,
in
fact,
prejudicially
accused
and
if
did
not
prejudice
him,
whether
a
federal
court
to
express
disapproval
of
that
conduct
and
grant
habeas
corpus
relief
to
a
state
prisoner.
also
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
this
court
should
overrule
long
and
well-settled
precedents.
these
precedents
establish
that
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
is
one
which
only
requires
the
juries
remain
free
from
actual
bias.
the
respondent
wants
this
court
to
replace
that
principle
with
one
which
requires
removing
of
a
sitting
juror
upon
facts
showing
--
upon
facts
which
might
render
a
hypothetical
juror
biased
even
though
it
was
shown
that
the
particular
jury
in
the
case
remained
actually
impartial.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
completely
--
i
would
think
it's
a
completely
different
ground.
to
place
the
--
that
decision
in
context,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
state
proceedings
and
then
just
bring
it
to
the
second
circuit
decision
and
judge
pierce's
decision.
but
let
me
--
let
me
answer
your
question
directly,
judge
pierce
used
the
implied
bias
standard,
the
circuit
court,
i
think,
without
regard
to
prejudice
at
all
just
said
the
prosecutor's
error,
there
was
prosecutorial
error
here,
consequently
there
must
be
a
reversal.
they
didn't
look
to
imply
bias
at
all.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
i
believe
they
did.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
--
i
think
it
is
different.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
--
a
killing
on
christmas
eve
in
1968
when
they
have
to
unsuccessfully
trying
to
extort
money
from
a
person,
respondent
william
phillips,
then
a
new
york
city
police
officer,
killed
that
person
whom
he
was
extorting,
or
sought
to
extort
killed
another
eyewitness
and
sought
to
kill
even
--
killed
an
eyewitness
and
sought
to
kill
a
second
eyewitness,
that
person
survived.
three
years
later
in
1971,
respondent
was
indicted
and
his
first
trial
in
1972
ended
in
a
mistrial
because
of
a
hung
jury.
in
1974,
he
was
brought
to
trial
again
and
convicted.
during
the
voir
dire
at
the
second
trial,
the
defense
found
one
john
dana
smith
acceptable
as
a
juror.
smith
was
a
vietnam
veteran
who's
about
to
graduate
columbia
college
and
he
was
accepted
by
the
defense
even
though
he
worked
as
a
security
guard
or
a
security
position
in
bloomingdale's
and
was
then
actively
seeking
a
law
enforcement
job
and
at
the
time,
had
an
application
pending
with
the
federal
law
enforcement
agency.
subsequently
during
trial,
smith
was
having
lunch
with
a
friend,
a
court
officer
in
a
court
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
and
they're
sitting
and
talking,
and
the
court
officer
who
knew
smith's
wife
from
john
jay
college
said,
“i
am
applying
for
a
job
in
the
district
attorney's
office
as
an
investigator,
there
may
be
some
jobs
there
that
you
might
be
interested
in.”
and
so
they
asked
about
the
jobs,
they
didn't
know
much
about
it
but
smith
said,
“well,
how
should
i
apply?”
and
he
says,
“well,
write
a
resume
and
send
a
letter
to
the
district
attorney's
officer
and
i'll
find
out
more
details
on
how
to
apply
for
you.”
and
that's
what
smith
did
a
week
later.
he
sent
a
letter,
saying,
“i'm
--
i
hear
you
have
positions
open
in
a
major
felony
investigating
unit,
i
am
interested,”
signed
john
dana
smith
and
sent
his
resume.
he
didn't
mention
at
all
anything
about
him
being
a
juror.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
in
--
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
there
were.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
it
would
have
been
up
to
the
discretion
of
a
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
he
could
have.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well,
if
you
--
it
seems
to
me
that
under
new
york
--
if
you
look
under
new
york
law
at
the
time,
even
today,
the
judge
would
have
discretion
provided
he
found
the
juror
actually
biased,
will
be
actually
influence,
and
that
discretion
is
--
is
virtually
unreviewable
as
it
is
in
federal
court.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
no
--
if
he
--
no,
but
in
other
words,
in
making
that
determination,
it
would
give
great
weight
to
him
if
you
found
actual
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that
is
correct,
yes.
you
would
have
to
exclude
the
juror.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
the
--
the
exact
scope
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
that
--
in
that
context,
i'm
not
sure
of
whether
--
whether
it
would
bar
a
subsequent
trial.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
i
do
not
believe
--
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
--i
think
a
reading
of
--
of
the
state,
if
he
found
that
he
was
not
bias,
i
don't
think
the
judge
could
have
removed
him
under
new
york
law
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
believe
that's
correct
under
the
law
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
believe
--
i
believe
that
will
be
the
way
i
would
read
cpl
sections
270.35.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
criminal
procedure
law
section
270.35(2)
which
is
repeated
in
--
on
page
28
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
it's
not
clear
what
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
they
don't
really
discuss
it
and
say,
it's
good
light,
we
hear
the
judge
would
have
removed
him
and
consequently,
the
defendant
was
denied
--
the
respondent
was
denied
a
fair
trial,
that's
all
it
said.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well,
i
think
this
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
at
least
under
new
york
law,
they
would
be
suggesting
there's
a
good
chance
that
judge
would
have
found
him
actual
bias,
they'll
remove
him.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well,
if
they
were
saying
that
he
would
exercise
a
discretion,
then
i
don't
think
he
has
to
remove
the
juror
then,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
they'll
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you
correctly
there
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
don't
think
they
applied
any
standard
at
all.
i
think
what
they've
said
is
the
prosecutor
failed
to
disclose
if
this
juror
applied
for
a
job
with
his
office.
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
that
disclosure
and
wherefore,
we
reverse.
they
say
it
in
the
opinion,
we
simply
--
they
are
holding
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well,
if
--
yes.
and
if
they're
saying
that,
if
you
--
if
you're
suggesting
to
me
that
they
are
saying
that
that
jury
in
--
is
in
fact
bias.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well,
but
if
he
--
if
he
is
not
--
if
he
is
not
bias,
it's
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
what
constitute
--
constitutional
right
would
be
violated
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
the
application
for
the
job.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well
--
but
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
but
unless
the
prosecutor's
failure
prejudices
the
defendant
in
some
way.
i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
that
you
do
not
get
a
reversal.
i
mean
the
agurs
case
stands
to
that
proposition.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that
was
why
--
that's
why
they're
wrong.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
believe
that
is
why
the
case
is
here.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
thank
you
justice
white.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well,
this
is
really
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
but
i
think
they
--
if
the
judge
--
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
but
if
the
judge
in
fact
found
the
juror
bias,
i
think
the
constitution
will
require
him
to
remove
the
juror.
but
that's
not
what
the
second
circuit's
holding
is
all
about.
i
think
they
didn't
care
about
whether
this
juror
was
bias
actually
or
implied.
they
say
the
prosecutor
breached
the
duty
and
that
ends
our
inquiry.
they
don't
care
about
whether
or
not,
you
know,
what
would
follow
from
that
and
in
the
--
in
their
holding
of
the
under
opinion,
we
simply
hold,
when
someone
has
applied
for
a
job
with
a
prosecutor's
office,
he
must
dispose
it.
that's
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no
--
no
it
would
not.
although
it's
a
practical
matter
if
the
defendant
objected,
it
would
seem
to
me
he'd
probably
be
waiving
any
right
that
he
might
serve
on.
and
if
i
were
the
trial
judge,
and
i
said
to
the
defendant
that
i
think
this
juror
is
actually
bias,
the
defense
says
no,
keep
him
on,
it's
practical
that
i
leave
the
juror
on,
it's
the
defendant's
right.(voice
overlap)
unless
it
was
prejudice
against
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
not
when
if
the
defendant
consented.
i
think
he
would
be
out
of
court
in
the
new
york
courts,
if
the
defendant
consented.
certainly
he
would
be
out
of
court
in
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
don't
think
any
appellate
division
would
exercise
discretion
in
that
case
to
reverse.
but
what
i
--
assuming
that
--
i
know
this
is
going
to
be
hard,
in
some
so
--
if
we
assume
the
prosecutor
didn't
find
out
about
it
until
after
trial,
the
juror's
application.
what
this
court
has
held
the
remedy
in
that
situation
to
be
is
you
have
a
post-trial
hearing
to
determine
the
bias,
or
lack
of
bias
of
the
juror.
that's
what
this
court
has
held.
now,
unless
we're
going
to
punish
the
prosecutor
and
--
and
that
hearing
is
adequate
to
protect
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
unless
you're
going
to
say,
because
of
the
prosecutorial
misconduct,
that
procedure
is
not
adequate,
i
mean
that's
the
only
way
you
could
say
that.
and
in
fact,
what
you're
saying
is
you're
going
to
punish
the
state
for
the
prosecutor's
misconduct.
even
though
there's
a
procedure
available,
which
can
determine
whether
or
not
that
juror
was
bias.
and
we
don't
think
the
law
requires
such
a
holding
by
this
court.
now
in
agurs,
you
have
--
the
court
found
that
the
prejudice,
and
agurs
is
a
case,
of
course,
dealing
with
the
guilt
or
innocence
context
where
the
prosecutor
fails
to
disclose
really
exculpatory
evidence
or
--
or
doesn't
respond
to
a
request,
well
that's
purge
of
testimony
coming
to
trial.
and
in
that
context,
this
court
held
that
--
no,
it's
not
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal,
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
and
they
built
in
to
the
--
into
those
three
standards
of
prejudice
to
rule
effect.
they
were
saying
the
same
thing
--
a
similar
requirement
through
here
but
the
nature
of
the
right
is
different.
there,
you're
dealing
with
a
right
to
submit
evidence
to
the
jury,
and
the
only
remedy
that
you
could
have,
once
you
found
a
violation
--
a
prosecutor's
breach
of
duty,
the
only
appropriate
remedy
is
then
to
submit
the
case
to
a
new
jury.
when
you're
dealing
with
the
impartiality
of
a
juror,
however,
where
the
judge
was
going
to
hold
it
--
with
hold
an
inquiry
during
trial,
how
is
a
defendant
prejudiced
if
the
prosecutor
fails
to
hold
with
turnover
information
if
the
hearing
is
held
after
trial.
that
hearing
has
been
recognized
as
adequate.
in
other
words,
i
think
it's
--
what
justice
white
said
in
the
morrison
case.
you've
got
to
tailor
the
remedy
to
the
conduct
involved.
here,
the
conduct
involved
was
--
the
--
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
and
then
the
prosecutor
effectively
--
appropriate
remedy
under
the
remmer
case
is
to
have
the
pretrial
hearing.
now,
the
court
in
agurs
said,
“well,
we
have
to
take
into
consideration
somehow
that
the
prosecutor
failed
to
disclose.”
and
--
and
in
agurs,
what
you
did
--
what
you
said,
“well,
we'll
--
we
won't
follow
the
ordinary,
newly
discovered
evidence
rule
which
requires
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
was
--
approved
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
the
result
would
have
been
different.”
what
the
state
judge
did
here,
is
he
required
the
prosecutor
to
establish
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
the
juror
was
impartial.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
perhaps,
yes,
but
not
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
--
in
the
united
states
versus
wood
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
there
was
a
case
where
an
argument
that
government
employees,
should
automatically
be
impliedly
bias
in
--
in
any
--
in
any
criminal
prosecution
the
federal
government
brought.
and
in
that
case
held,
there
would
be
no
requirement
of
implied
bias
in
that
situation,
and
they
went
further
i
think,
because
they
talked
about
particular
circumstances,
and
they
raise
a
situation.
what
about
a
situation
where
a
juror
has
--
works,
a
potential
works
to
an
agency
very
interested
in
the
case
or
interested
in
the
case.
and
the
court
said
there,
an
inquiry
about
actual
bias
is
more
than
enough
to
deal
with
that
situation.
whether
or
not
the
situation
is
that
one
could
conjure
up
where
you
would
want
to
imply
--
find
someone
impliedly
biased,
is
the
question
is
not
before
the
court
today.
but
certainly
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
the
wood
case
would
control
and
at
least
where
a
juror
has
only
applied
for
his
job,
there
should
be
no
rule
of
implied
bias.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
the
way
the
prosecutor
found
out
is
that
the
--
the
letter
eventually
got
to
the
person
in
charge
of
hiring.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
and
--
and
a
--
a
friend
of
the
juror
mentioned
to
an
assistant
district
attorney
that
this
person
was
on
the
jury.
the
jury
himself
never
mentioned
it,
in
deed
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
his
friend
did,
there's
a
finding
both
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
the
juror
--
no
sir,
the
friend
took
in
interest,
but
the
juror
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
absolutely
not,
this
is
a
friend
by
the
name
of
fontaine,
it's
the
gentleman
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
indeed,
there's
a
find
to
the
contrary
that
the
juror
knew
anything
about
fontaine
talking
to
anybody
about
the
job.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
mr.
fontaine.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
what
happened
--
what
happened
was
that
the
juror
brought
the
letter
to
a
luncheon
meeting,
and
said,
“here
it
is,
submit
mine
when
you
submit
yours.”
it's
all
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
so.if
you
--
i
mean,
just
give
him
the
letter
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
he
did
not.
he
--
he
was
a
court
officer
in
--
on
rainey
park
in
new
york
city.
he
was
not
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
he
do
not
work
to
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
he
was.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes.
he
was
applying
for
a
job
and
the
juror
said,
“look,
while
--
when
you
submit
yours,
i'll
submit
mine.”
and
when
we
went
to
submit
his,
they
said,
“you're
not
--
that's
not
your
application.”
he
said,
“no,
we'll
only
take
yours.
so
you
personally,
why
don't
you
just
put
that
one
in
the
mail?”
and
that's
what
he
did.he
did
not
work
for
the
prosecutor's
office
at
all.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
he
worked
--
he
worked
as
a
court
officer
for
the
state.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
he
had
at
least
one
with
assistant
district
attorney
where
he
said,
“listen,
you
know
my
friend
applied
for
a
--
a
job,
he
is
a
juror.
do
you
think
there's
anything
wrong
about
that?”
i
mean
that
was
when
the
assistant
district
attorney
said,
“look,
we're
not
going
to
process
that
application.”
and
they
--
and
he
went
back
and
told
the
person
in
charge
of
hiring
and
that
person
put
a
hold
on
the
application.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
the
--
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
charged
of
hiring
for
that
position,
ms.
sudolnik.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
he
didn't
ask
him
to
mention
it.
he
just
asked
him
to
submit
the
application
with
his
because
he's
applying
in
the
same
time.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
there
was
nothing
--
no
--
nothing
discussion
on
any
problem
or
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
finding
both
by
the
district
court
and
the
state
court
judge
that
the
juror
was
totally
unaware
and
did
not
authorize
anything
that
was
going
on.
and
the
juror
testified
which
was
credited
by
the
state
judge
that
he
saw
absolutely
no
connection
with
--
with
his
job
application
and
the
service
on
the
jury,
he
did
not
know
anything
that
anybody,
you
know
was
talking
to
anyone.
you
can,
you
know
--
you
can
look
at
facts
when
you
put
one
interpretation
and
another.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
prosecutor
--
the
prosecutor
was
wrong
not
to
do
that,
we
don't
take
issue
with
that,
and
that
is
not
the
--
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
that
statute
was
subsequent.
what
happened
with
that
statute
is
subsequently
amended
so
reply
--
requiring
must
--
you
must
move
the
juror
when
the
--
when
he
finds
substantial
misconduct
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that
statute
has
been
subsequently
amended
to
require
that
--
that
a
mistrial
be
declared
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
it
--
certainly
is.
but
let's
--
you
know
the
court
hasn't
asked
me
about
why
is
this
--
why
isn't
this
hearing
--
why
is
this
hearing
adequate?
now
the
remmer
case
of
course
held
these
post-trial
hearings
are
adequate
and
they're
adequate
in
federal
court
and
adequate
in
state
court.
and
it
seems
to
me,
unless
you
want
to
say
that
you
have
a
per
se
rule
because
the
prosecutor
failed
to
disclose
it,
that
this
hearing
should
be
held
adequate
on
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
a
state
conviction.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
beneficial
for
the
court
for
me
to
--
to
tell
you
about
judge
birns'
finding,
these
are
some
concern
here.
and
here,
judge
birns
found
that
the
juror
was
honest
but
naive.
he
was
naive
because,
you
know,
he
didn't
realize
that
someone
would
see
a
connection.
he
saw
no
connection
between
applying
for
a
job.
and
--
and
the
judge
found
that
he
was
under
no
influence
during
the
trial.
on
the
voir
dire
sense,
this
is
not
like
a
juror
coming
out
from
nowhere
and
saying,
“i
want
something
in
exchange
for
my
participation.”
and
the
jury
on
voir
dire
he
indicated
that
he
was
interested
in
law
enforcement.
and
he
applied
well
into
trial,
when
he
just
met
a
friend
at
lunch.
and
he
did
nothing
else
with
respect
to
this
application,
he
merely
sent
it.
that's
what
the
findings
of
the
state
court
are
and
--
and
despite
respondent's
attempt
to
change
that,
those
are
the
facts.
he
didn't
do
anything
justice
marshall.
he
merely
sent
the
letter.
it
was
an
innocent
act
by
a
naive
young
man,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
calls
for
kind
of
habeas
corpus
review
by
a
federal
court
of
a
state
conviction.
the
state
court
held
the
hearing
of
this
court,
requires
all
the
time
in
federal
cases.
why
then,
merely
because
of
the
prosecutor's
misconduct
is
that
hearing
going
to
be
held
inadequate.
return
to
your
question
of
implied
bias
in
--
in
frazier
versus
the
united
states.
and
--
and
of
course
the
wood
case
says
that
you
have
a
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
and
with
that
constitutional
right
would
say
--
it
means
a
jury
that's
free
from
actual
bias.
and
if
the
jury
is
free
from
actual
bias,
that
really,
generally
ends
the
inquiry.
in
woods
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
he
--
he
deliberately
failed
to
disclose?
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
and
there
was
no
question
asked?
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
and
when
is
the
discovery
made?
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
think
under
the
new
york
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--
under
the
new
york
statute,
you
would
have
to
have
a
showing
of
actual
bias.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
you
would.
i
believe
--
i
believe
that's
a
law
on
new
york.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
come
--
i
doubt
very
much
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
come
out
this
way.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
because
i
think
they
focus
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
think
they
focused
entirely
on
the
prosecutor's
misconduct
and
that's
what
they
were
concern.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
(voice
overlap)
i
mean
that's
--
that's
exactly
what
they
did.
i
don't
think
they
would
have
--
they
may
have
had
a
little
bit
more
difficulty.
i
can
tell
you
during
the
oral
argument,
before
the
second
circuit
which
i
did,
that's
what
justice
nicholson
was
concerned
about.
he
wrote
the
opinion
from
the
very
start.
the
prosecutor's
conduct
--
the
prosecutor's
conduct,
and
that's
exactly
how
that
opinion
is
written.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
that's
--
that's
exactly
our
point
justice
white.
that
--
and
in
that
context,
the
post-trial
hearing
under
the
remmer
case
in
the
federal
court
would
be
more
than
adequate
to
deal
with
the
situation.
and
consequently,
you
should
be
more
than
adequate
to
deal
with
the
situation
here.
in
the
second
circuit,
the
opinion
can
only
be
rather
saying,
“we
don't
like
what
the
prosecutor
did.”
and
as
--
i
might
say,
if
the
juror,
if
the
procedure
is
adequate,
and
the
juror
was
found
to
be
actually
impartial,
i
don't
see
how
the
defendant's
conviction
has
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
--
i
do
not
think
they
would
have.
i
think,
again
a
fair
--
by
way
of
emphasis,
a
fair
reading
of
their
opinion
is
they
are
concerned
with
prosecutorial
misconduct,
what
they
do
is
prosecutorial
misconduct.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
well
--
sometimes
--
sometimes
you
can
take
a
look
at
past
opinions
and
precedents
and
predict
what
a
court
is
going
to
do,
not
all
the
time.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
although
i
would
--
i
would
say
with
all
due
respect,
i
am
right
more
often
than
i'm
wrong
although
sometimes
it's
a
closed
question.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
but
--
but
i
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
he
--
he
said
in
his
opinion,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
trial
judge.
i'll
let
the
trial
judge
speak.
he
said
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
would
not
have
found
that
juror
bias
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no
--
no
i
think
the
reality
would
have
been,
he
would
have
said
to
the
prosecutor,
“don't
you
think
you
should
consent
to
the
removal
of
the
juror?”
and
the
--
and
i
don't
know
what
the
prosecutor
would
have
done
in
that
situation,
but
that's
how
i
think
a
state
trial
judge
would
have
handled
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
--
that
situation.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
yes,
he
would
have
asked
--
he
would
have
asked
both
in
--
in
that
situation.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
i
--
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
reading
of
his
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
of
his
own
view.
that
is
correct.
again,
and
i
guess
it's
--
your
questions
to
me
brought
that
out
justice
white
that
the
--
the
second
circuit
here
is
concerned
with
the
prosecutorial
misconduct.
that's
how
they
were
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
no,
i
read
it
that
way,
but
analytically,
i
think
that
that
is
important.
and
the
reason
i
think
that
is
important,
is
if
they
would
have
come
out
the
same
way,
if
they
would
have
come
out
a
different
way,
but
for
the
prosecutorial
misconduct
involved,
then,
in
effect,
you're
punishing
the
prosecutor
--
you're
punishing
the
state,
because
the
prosecutor
has
made
a
mistake
and
the
way
i
read
the
precedents
of
this
court,
unless
the
defendant
is
prejudiced
by
the
prosecutor's
conduct,
federal
habeas
corpus
should
not
lie
without
--
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
with
respect
to
a
possible
bias
of
a
juror,
the
united
states
versus
wood
i
think
is
the
leading
case,
and
that's
the
case
i
referred
to
in
my
discussion
with
justice
o'connor.
and
that
says
that
at
least
in
jury
selection
and
i
think
is
a
toughest
standing
during
trial
that
has
to
be
actual
bias.
and
that
case
has
stood
for
45
years
as
the
law
of
this
court.
and
--
and
to
change
that
ruling,
to
go
to
an
implied
bias
standard,
based
on
this
case,
in
effect,
you'd
now
going
to
have
to
sit
and
review
all
the
various
state
implied
bias
statutes,
and
if
we
point
out
a
brief,
they
are
many
and
numerous,
and
they're
going
to
be
(inaudible)
in
direct
appeal
to
this
court
and
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
and
i
don't
think
that's
necessary.
wood
has
served
very
well
for
the
45
years
and
there's
no
reason
to
abandon
him
at
this
point
in
time.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
listening
to
mr.
kunstler
described
the
case
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
relationship
or
reality
or
the
record.
i
mean,
the
suggestion
that
the
prosecutors
deliberately
met
and
chose
not
to
decide
this
--
discloses
the
court,
it's
just
not
true.
what
happened
there
is,
that
mr.
litman
was
standing
outside,
mr.
keenan's
office
to
talk
to
him
about
another
matter
and
ms.
sudolnik
came
up
to
say
--
to
tell
him
this,
he
was
in
the
middle
of
cross-examination.
she
said,
“oh
my
god!
that's
all
i
have
to
hear
now.
just
don't
tell
anybody.
just
don't
contact
him
at
all,
have
everyone
--
to
have
no
contact.”
and
that
was
the
extent
of
the
decision
in
this
case.
and
for
mr.
kunstler
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
juror
then
made
his
move
as
soon
as
he
was
selected
the
jury,
i
recommend
--
recommend
reading
mr.
kunstler
and
to
the
court,
the
record
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
because
that
was
--
what
happened
was
that
--
it's
been
going
on
for
a
while,
they
were
getting
on
the
voir
dire
minutes
and
they
knew
about
that
for
a
while
and
they
finally
disclose
that.
mr.
robert
m.
pitler
judge,
i
--
i
really
do
not
think
so.
and
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
to
credit
the
prosecutor's
testimony
in
that
regard.
but
let
me
talk
about
the
juror
as
well,
that
mr.
kunstler
would
make
it
seem
that
as
soon
as
upon
his
being
sworn,
he
actively
run
out
for
a
job.
that's
not
true.
at
--
at
pages
--
the
record
makes
clear
throughout
that
he
applied
for
that
job
on
the
16th
of
october.
that
was
three
weeks
after
he's
been
(inaudible)
about
a
juror
and
that's
when
he
first
found
out
about
it.
so
to
try
to
create
this
impression
of
prosecutors
running
around
and
conspiring
and
the
juror
running
around
and
actively
--
see,
is
just
not
true.
it
has
no
--
if
you
read
our
brief
and
if
you
read
the
record,
you
will
see
what
happened
here,
you
had
an
innocent,
naive
juror
who
was
actually
impartial.
the
constitution
requires
no
more,
the
state
courts
requires
no
more,
and
a
federal
courts
sitting
in
habeas
corpus
review
of
the
conviction
certainly
should
require
no
more.
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
