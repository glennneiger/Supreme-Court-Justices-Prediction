mr.
william
m.
kunstler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
want
to
apologize
for
what
maybe
a
very
hoarse
voice.
it's
something
that
i
have
picked
up
in
oregon
two
days
ago
and
there's
nothing
much
i
can
do
about
it.
this
case
is
a
unique
one,
it
was
called
that
--
not
only
by
myself
in
our
brief,
but
it
was
called
by
the
trial
judge
himself
as
unprecedented
imprudence
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
unique
misjudgments
by
the
prosecutor,
extraordinary
about
the
submission
of
the
application
for
a
job
in
the
middle
of
trial.
it
involves
essentially
and
i
think
mr.
pitler
has
stated
some
of
it,
a
juror
applying
for
a
job
in
the
capital
prosecution.
and
his
course
to
the
application
began
on
the
very
day
that
he
was
selected
when
he
heard,
even
before
other
jurors
had
been
seated
when
he
heard
in
a
lunch
with
court
officers
about
the
opening
of
a
job
on
the
major
felony
squad
of
the
district
attorney's
office.
that
was
on
i
believe
september
23,
1974.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
justice
rehnquist,
i
do,
but
differently
than
mr.
pitler
does.
because
i
thought
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing
in
using
agurs
has
a
standard
was
to
say
essentially
that
the
prosecution's
misconduct
prevented
the
defendant
from
exercising
a
right
that
he
had
under
270.35.
that
because
he
didn't
know
about
it,
he
couldn't
go
to
the
trial
judge
at
a
time
when
removal
of
a
juror
is
far
simpler
than
it
is
after
conviction
and
utilized
that
statute.
and
that
statute
does
not
say
that
you
need
an
actual
bias
juror.
it
says
a
juror,
the
fact
that
a
juror
is
grossly
unqualified
to
sit
in
the
case,
that's
one
standard
or
--
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here,
a
juror
engaged
in
misconduct
of
a
substantial
nature.
phillips
never
had
that
opportunity
because
of
the
nondisclosure.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
understand
that.
but
i
think
one
of
the
aspects
of
due
process
is
preventing
the
utilization
of
available
statutes
--
remedial
statutes.
i
think
if
a
prosecutor
engages
in
conduct
that
prevents
that
utilization,
you
have
a
substantial
due
process
question
that
has
not
been
fully
briefed
on
either
side
here,
but
i
think
it's
existent.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
to
a
degree.
i
think
a
statute
that
gives
you
remedial
right
presents
a
due
process
situation.
the
second
circuit,
if
it's
read
the
way
mr.
pitler
is
saying,
it's
saying
under
agurs,
you
have
right
where
something
is
withheld
deliberately
which
may
in
some
way
affect
your
trial
to
utilize
it.
and
i
think
if
you
divorce
the
statutes
out
of
it,
270.35,
you
can
read
another
ground.
but
i
thought
the
second
circuit
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
fact
that
they
were
denied
a
right,
that
they
had
under
state
law
to
utilize
which
i
think
is
a
due
process
--
rises
to
due
process
proportions.
if
a
right
is
existent
under
state
law
and
the
prosecutor
deliberately
prevents
you
form
achieving
that
right,
i
think
it's
a
due
process
violation.
but
i'm
not
sure,
justice
rehnquist,
which
way
the
circuit
went.
i
don't
think
it's
the
most
artful
of
opinions
that
i've
ever
read,
and
you
can
read
it
under
agurs
and
you
can
read
it
under
my
interpretation
but
either
one,
i
accept
it
because
they
affirmed.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes.
he
did,
and
so
did
the
assistant
prosecutor.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
the
rationale
justice
white
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
was
in
the
middle
of
cross-examination
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
was
preparing
summation
and
therefore,
i
just
couldn't
get
around
to
it.
i
was
filled
--
my
mind
was
filled
with
that
defense.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i
think
that's
the
reason
that
he
gave,
that
he's
mind
was
so
filled
with
summation
and
so
filled
with
cross-examination
of
the
defendant
who
was
i
believe
understand
that
at
the
time.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
he
admitted
to
do
it,
but
it's
very
strange
justice
white
that
he
did
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
he
did.
i'm
not
sure
i
take
that
--
except
with
(inaudible)
but
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
he
may
have
but
a
very
interesting
thing
is
that
another
juror,
he
did
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
judge.
so
his
mind
was
not
so
filled
with
summation
and
cross-examination
to
forget
juror,
i
believe
number
three,
mr.
lawrence
bethel
or
juror
number
six,
i
can't
remember
the
numbers
who
they
found
out
in
the
middle
of
trial
was
a
witness
for
the
district
attorney
or
special
narcotics
prosecution
of
the
district
attorney.
and
they
did
bring
him
to
the
attention,
a
little
late
because
they
discovered
it
early
in
october,
and
they
revealed
it
some
time
in
november,
i
believe.
but,
i
think
that
belies
his
testimony,
that
my
mind
was
too
filled.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that
judge
was
excused,
consent
of
all
party.
i
mean
that
juror
was
excused
with
the
consent
of
all
parties.
judge
had
a
hearing
and
excused
that
juror.
and,
by
the
way
the
statute
now
reads
must
excuse
then
it
was
a
--a
may
standard.
but,
in
any
event,
phillips
never
got
the
opportunity
to
even
have
the
may
portion
of
the
statute,
put
into
operation
because
of
failure
to
disclose.
to
go
on
with
the
juror's
conduct
in
this
particular
case,
the
day
he
sworn,
he
learned
with
the
opening
from
court
officers,
he
expressed
as
an
interest,
he
gets
the
court
officer
to
find
out
for
him
how
to
apply.
and
then
the
court
officer
goes
to
or
calls
the
district
attorney's
office,
gets
the
procedure,
ultimately
finds
out
who's
in
charge.
the
district
attorney
by
the
name
of
joan
sudolnik
comes
back
to
mr.
smith,
he
says,
“here's
how
you
do
it.”
mr.
smith
fills
out
an
application
form
which
is
brief,
it's
in
the
record,
it's
very
short,
with
a
resume
and
then
mr.
fontaine
takes
it
with
the
zone
to
the
district
attorney's
office.
but
apparently,
the
district
attorney
said,
“you
must
mail
it
in
personally.
we
don't
accept
another
person's
application
from
you.”
and
so,
he
then
stamped
it
and
mailed
it
and
it
arrived
on
october
23rd
in
the
district
attorney's
office.
the
trial
was
then
into
the
third
of
its
seventh
week
at
that
time.
his
letter
went
to
a
district
attorney
convoy
who
refuted
to
ms.
sudolnik
who
was
in
charged
of
personal
recruitment
at
that
time.
she
refuted
to
an
assistant
district
attorney,
lang
who
was
sudolnik's
subordinate.
and
then
there
was
a
lot
of
communication
between
lang
and
not
only
this
court
officer,
but
another
one
in
which
lang
is
told
that
smith
is
a
juror
in
the
phillips
trial.
so,
whether
mr.
smith
told
him
to
tell
that
or
mr.
piazza
or
mr.
fontaine
did
it
on
their
own
but
both
informed
the
district
attorney's
office
that
smith
was
a
juror
in
that
trial.
i'm
sure
they
both
knew
about
it
from
meeting
him
in
the
courthouse
and
learned
it
from
him
or
from
courthouse
gossip.
but
in
any
event,
the
district
attorney
knew
it
very
shortly
after
the
application
was
received.
and
then
the
district
attorney
or
at
least
the
assistant
district
attorneys
told
the
prosecutors
on
november
14th
i
believe,
a
week
or
so
before
judgment
in
this
case
or
the
juries
verdict
that
there
was
a
juror
who
was
applying
for
a
job.
the
prosecutors
decided
to
tell
nobody
in
this
situation.
on
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
they
decided.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
they
got
together,
they
testified
at
trial
that
they
had
met
on
it,
but
they
had
discussed
it,
and
they
decided
to
do
nothing
more
but
tell
assistants,
lang,
holmes,
sudolnik
not
to
consider
it
until
after
the
trial.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
there
was
an
affirmative
decision
not
to
tell
the
judge
or
defense
counsel.
that
occurred
on
the
14th
of
november.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i'm
using
the
trial
prosecutors,
a
man
named
litman
and
his
assistance
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
who
was
trying
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
the
assistants
who
are
running
the
recruitment
program
were
not
trying
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
the
two
of
them.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
lapenta
and
litman,
the
two
trial
prosecutors.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
except
justice
brennan,
after
they
have
reached
their
decision.
they
informed
these
people
whose
names
i've
been
using,
lang
and
holmes
or
sudolnik,
they
were
informed
not
to
process
it
any
further
and
not
to
communicate
with
the
jury
until
the
trial
was
over.
they
never
told
the
district
attorney
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that's
correct.
they
both
testified.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
they
testified.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well
that
was
the
explanation
given
by
mr.
litman,
i
can't
remember
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
he
was
in
chief
trial
prosecutor.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
he
was
the
assistant
attorney
--
district
attorney
in
georgia.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
it
was
undoubtedly
recess,
evening.
in
fact,
there
was
one
meeting
on
the
15th
of
november,
the
next
day
after
the
prosecutors
discovered
it,
that
holmes,
one
of
the
district
attorneys
who
was
involved
in
the
processing
of
the
application,
what
meant
with
mr.
lapenta
who
was
the
second
in
command
of
the
trial
team
and
tried
to
talk
to
him
about
it
and
lapenta
told
him,
“i
don't
want
to
listen
to
that.
i
don't
want
to
hear
that
anymore.”
and
that
was
the
end
--
that
was
the
last
that
you
have
as
for
the
prosecutors
but
it
was
deliberate,
willful
decision
not
to
tell
anyone
including
the
district
attorney
himself,
mr.
q
who
never
learned
of
it.
after
--
as
soon
as
the
trial
ended,
then
of
course
mr.
smith
called
ms.
sudolnik
up,
the
very
next
day,
after
judgment.
after
verdict,
he
called
ms.
sudolnik
up,
he
couldn't
reach
her,
and
so
he
got
a
friend
of
his,
mr.
reilly
who
ran
and
i
think
still
does
the
bloomingdale's
security
office
in
new
york,
he
got
mr.
reilly
to
call
up
ms.
sudolnik
and
mr.
reilly
said,
“what
gives
with
smith's
application?
he
was
a
juror
and
just
completed
phillips
trial.”
and
i
think
the
implication
of
that
statement
were
hardly
lost
on
anyone.
in
any
event,
ms.
sudolnik
told
him
then
that
the
juror's
application
would
be
considered
in
the
normal
course
of
business.
that's
the
day
after
the
jury's
conviction.
the
district
attorney,
mr.
q
never
learned
of
this
until
december
4th
of
1974,
some
two
weeks
or
so
after
verdict.
when
mr.
lapenta
told
mr.
q's
assistant,
john
keenan
in
an
elevator
in
the
federal
building
where
phillips
had
a
habeas
on
another
matter
going
told
mr.
keenan
that
one
of
the
jurors
had
applied
for
a
job
during
the
trial.
mr.
keenan
told
the
district
attorney,
richard
q
and
then
five
days
later,
they
informed
the
trial
judge,
and
the
trial
judge
did
hold
a
hearing
both
on
juror
number
three
and
juror
number
six.
so
the
sequence
you
have
is
that
at
least
by
the
13th
of
november,
the
district
attorney's
office,
many
people
knew
that
smith
was
a
juror
in
the
phillips
case
and
that
smith
had
an
application
pending
in
the
office.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
did
--
i
can't
remember
the
transcript
that
well
justice
brennan
but
he
was
not
told
until
december
4th.
i
guess
the
reason
is
a
prosecutors,
the
trial
prosecutors
did
not
tell
mr.
keenan
until
that
day
when
they're
at
the
federal
court
hearing
when
he
said
in
words
or
substance,
by
the
way,
did
you
hear
this?
and
told
him
and
then
mr.
keenan
on
the
forth
told
mr.
q.
so
it
was
the
suppression
at
the
lower
level,
the
trial
prosecutor's
level
as
well
as
by
all
these
other
district
attorney's
who
knew
of
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
justice
white
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think,
as
i
remember
the
testimony
before
the
judge
birns
in
the
hearing,
the
decision
was
made
not
to
tell
the
court
or
defense
counsel
on
the
14th
of
november
and
then
the
instructions
were
given
to
the
assistant
district
attorneys
who
were
working
on
the
applications
to
just
not
do
anything
with
the
application
or
talk
to
the
juror,
communicate
with
them
until
after
the
trial.
i
don't
remember
any
testimony
saying,
“don't
tell
mr.
q.”
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
remember
that
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
he
found
in
december
9th.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
oh,
the
consequences?
he
held
the
hearing
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
chief
justice
burger
where
he
found
no
actual
bias.
he
did
not
even
consider
implied
bias,
it
isn't
mentioned
in
his
opinion
and
i
don't
know
whether
your
counsel
spoke
about
it,
or
with
the
trial
counsel
or
even
appellate
counsel
but
he
found
only
no
actual
bias
and
he
said
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
i
think
you
must
go
to
the
next
question
because
actual
bias
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that's
correct.
i
think
if
you
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--
don't
go
to
the
next
step
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
implied
bias
is
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
when
you
say
per
se
rule,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
what
you
mean
except
as
i
understand
what
you're
saying
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i
don't
see
a
per
se
rule
here.
i
see
a
rule
in
case-to-case
and
i
see
some
situations
where
bias
must
be
implied.
this
court
has
found
it
in
several
cases.
the
cases
all
refuted
to
by
mr.
pitler
on
the
district
of
columbia
cases.
is
there
an
implied
bias
in
the
man
who
works
for
bureau
of
engraving
and
printing
to
serve
on
the
federal
jury
in
a
narcotics
case?
i
agree,
there's
no
implied
bias.
but
one
time,
this
court
held
in
crawford
there
was,
but
i'm
not
so
sure
i
subscribed
to
that
or
you'll
never
get
a
jury
in
the
district
of
columbia
if
everyone
that
worked
for
the
government
was
excluded?
and
i
don't
see
implied
bias
because
you
work
for
bureau
in
--
of
printing
and
engraving.
but
take
the
situation
if
the
juror
works
for
the
prosecutor,
the
district
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
would
be
applied
bias
to
me.
i
don't
see
anybody
working
for
the
prosecutor.
it
cannot
be
impliedly
biased.
now
that
doesn't
mean
they're
actually
biased
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
would
it
take
care
of
itself?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
oh,
no.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
if
he
disclosed
it
during
the
voir
dire,
then
you
have
chance
to
take
care
of
it,
of
course,
i
agree
with
that.
in
this
case,
there
was
nothing
to
disclose
because
he
didn't
make
his
move
until
he
was
sworn.
so
that
was
precluded
from
operating.
i
am
certain,
had
it
been
disclosed,
he
would
never
have
gotten
on
the
jury.
i
have
an
application
pending
with
the
very
office
which
is
prosecuting
the
defendant.
or
if
he
had
said
so
in
the
middle,
i
am
certain
judge
birns
would
have
excused
him.
judge
birns
is
speaking
ex
post
facto.
he's
just
going
through
a
highly
publicized,
very
significant
murder
trial,
and
the
prospect
of
setting
it
aside
now
is
a
much
more
difficult
task
for
a
trial
judge
as
we
all
know,
than
doing
it
in
the
middle
of
trial
when
all
you
can
do
is
excuse
the
juror
and
put
it
all
in
this
place.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
you
never
can
tell
actually,
of
course,
because
the
only
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
the
possibilities
are
that
this
man
who
was
totally
unqualified,
if
you
--
in
the
record
you'll
find
that
his
application
was
later
rejected
because
he
was
unqualified.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
to
be
more
inclined
to
convict,
then
not.
i
think
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
hung
jury,
if
that
was
possible
in
this
case,
more
inclined
to
convict,
yes.
and
i
think
there's
one
more
point
justice
white.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think
a
reasonable
man
might
find
that
conclusion,
i
think
as
justice
marshall
said,
the
first
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
the
burr
case,
there
are
some
situations
where
we
must
comply
biased,
and
one
of
those
is
where
a
man
is
a
job
seeker
with
the
prosecutor.
in
my
lexicon
because
a
reasonable
man
or
an
ordinary
average
man
as
justice
black
used
in
the
jury
selection
clause.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yeah.
i
think
you
will
have
a
challenge
for
cause,
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
a
cause
for
challenge.
the
judge
might
say
if
he
denied
it
--
(voice
overlap)
and
the
challenges
for
cause
are
difficult
because
if
the
perspective
juror
says,
“i've
applied
for
a
job,
but
i
am
not
prejudice.
i
can
decide
this
case
fairly
and
squarely.”
many
judges
say
that's
it,
that's
not
cause
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
used
peremptory
–-
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
tried
cause
first
–-
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
when
i
came
at
proper
on
that,
i
would
go
to
the
peremptory.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i
think
that's
true.
i'm
not
so
sure
i've
always
agreed
with
some
aspects
of
witherspoon
but
i
think
you
can
have
contentious
objections
to
the
death
penalty
and
still
be
a
fair
juror.
i
don't
like
the
death
penalty
but
i'm
going
to
decide
this
case
on
the
merits.
but
that's
a
little
different
here,
because
however
you
feel
in
your
conscience,
you're
not
beholding
in
any
way
to
the
prosecutor.
you're
not
thinking
in
your
mind,
if
i
go
this
way
or
that
way,
i
have
a
better
chance
or
a
lesser
chance
for
a
job,
and
i
think
an
average
man
would
consider
this.
i
don't
believe
mr.
smith's
protestations,
i
can't
prove
it,
but
i
just
think
justice
burger,
you
have
to
take
human
life
for
what
it
is
and
the
psychology
of
people
for
what
that
is.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
not
at
all.
in
fact,
not
even
the
judges
tell
the
jurors,
“you
don't
have
to
speak
to
anybody.”
some
even
prohibit
it.
and
then
the
federal
court
that's
quite
general
now.
but
in
the
state
courts,
they
use
to
give
in
an
option.
if
the
defense
wants
to
speak
to
you
or
prosecution
and
you
want
to
talk,
you
can
talk.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
because
the
juror
has
the
option
of
being
quiet.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
if
i
find
out,
you'll
rarely
find
out
anything.
they
leave
the
courtroom
and
the
courthouse
you
try
to
talk
to
them.
many
judges
say,
“you
shouldn't
talk”,
because
that
raises
the
specter
of
upsetting
the
jury
verdict
or
contradicting
jurors.
i
don't
know
what
was
said
in
this
case.
in
most
of
the
cases
i've
been
in,
on
the
state
level,
justice
o'connor,
it's
a
may.
you
may
talk
if
you
wish,
you
may
not
if
you
don't
wish.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
think
so.
just
take
this
as
an
example.
if
they
have
gone
up
to
mr.
smith
and
questioned
him
after
the
verdict,
i
don't
think
he
would
have
said,
“listen,
by
the
way
i
send
a
letter
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.”
i
think
he
would
have
just
said
the
questions
are
--
how
did
you
decide
--
why
did
you
decide
this
way?
i
did
it
for
x,
y,
and
z.
but
you
would
never
find
about
the
letter.
and
it's
the
letter
that
makes
the
situation.
he's
a
job
seeker
with
the
prosecutor.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no.
but
it's
an
impossible
hearing.
because,
it's
--
it's
not
like
the
remmer
hearing
that
mr.
pitler
relies
on.
in
remmer,
the
standard
was
not
the
internal
workings
of
a
juror's
mind
who
is
guilty
of
misconduct,
because
everything
militates
against
saying,
“i
was
guilty
of
misconduct.”
this
man
wanted
to
go
to
law
school.
law
enforcement
was
an
interim
occupation
for
him.
he
was
going
to
take
a
job
with
the
--
the
dea,
the
drug
enforcement
agency
overseas
for
a
year.
come
back
and
go
to
a
law
school.
so,
imagine
if
he
had
ever
said
understand,
assuming
it
to
be
true.
i
decided
this
case
the
way
i
did
because
i
wanted
a
job
with
the
district
attorney's
office.
he
could
never
go
to
a
law
school.
he
could
never
get
a
job
in
law
enforcement,
and
he
might
be
prosecuted
for
contempt
certainly
if
not
under
the
criminal
statute
that
we
put
in
our
appendix.
i
don't
think
those
criminal
statutes
to
be
candid
applied
to
this
juror.
i've
tried
to
read
them
40
times
and
they
--
they
just
don't
seem
inapplicable
for
this
kind
of
misconduct,
but
certainly
contempt
would
not
be
inapplicable.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
on
the
voir
dire?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes.
he
said,
i'm
going
--
i've
been
working
as
a
security
guard
while
i'm
going
to
columbia
university,
school
of
general
studies.
i'm
graduating
in
october,
it's
a
very
--
the
month
later
after
his
selection.
i
then
intend
--
i've
applied
to
the
drug
enforcement
administration
for
a
job
overseas,
so
that
i
may
get
enough
money
to
go
back
--
to
go
to
law
school.
he
said
that
this
is
an
intermediate
step
for
me
and
so
he
really
wasn't
interested
much
in
law
enforcement
as
a
permanent
career,
but
being
an
attorney.
and,
that's
one
reason
why
i
think
that
when
he
said
what
he
said
in
the
post-trial
hearing
that
he
could
not
be
candid
if
the
truth
were
as
i
think
it
well,
may
be,
he
couldn't
say
it.
it
would
ruin
him
for
life.
and
that's
an
awful
big
burden
to
put
on
a
man
to
accept
his
word
in
all
do
conscience
as
being
the
last
word.
and
that's
what
justice
birns
did.
he
said,
“this
is
the
word
of
this
man,
he
told
me
he
would
be
fair
and
was
fair
and
i
accept
it.”
plus
all
of
the
other
evidence
had
nothing
to
do
with
him,
just
when
the
letters
were
mailed
and
who
was
spoken
to.
i
might
indicate
that
when
he
was
rejected
as
being
unqualified,
he
probably
knew
he
was
unqualified,
because
what
they
have
in
life,
he's
been
a
security
guard
at
bloomingdale's
and
he
wanted
to
get
on
the
major
case
felony
squad
of
the
district
attorney,
and
was
rejected
for
being
inadequately
prepared.
and
i
think
he
knew
that
too.
this
was
a
golden
opportunity
for
this
man.
he
got
on
the
on
the
jury
of
a
major
case
that
have
been
tended
to
for
acquittal
when
mr.
bailey
tried
it,
the
first
time
around.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
they
admit
that
in
their
brief.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
thought
it
was
all
a
speculation
from
the
newspaper
reports,
but
then
i
noticed
in
their
brief,
they
say
the
same
thing.
i
think
in
their
petition
for
certiorari,
they
said
it
was
tended
to
for
acquittal.
i
think
everybody
accepted
that
chief
justice
burger,
although
it
came
from
the
newspapers.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it
has
to
be
speculation,
but
i
think
it's
a
speculation
when
you
do
--
go
into
implied
bias,
you
have
to
do
it.
when
blackstone
said,
“you
can't
have
the
employer.”
for
example,
a
--
a
juror
on
the
jury
who
was
employed
by
the
other
side,
that's
all
speculation
too.
that
man
could
be
fair
in
some,
you
know
actual
standard
of
life.
but
there
are
some
places
you
must
say
as
chief
justice
marshall
said,
we
have
to
draw
the
line.
you
cannot
permit
people
on
jurors
who
are
seeking
favors
from
one
side
or
the
other.
and
new
york
is
so
held,
we
cited
the
tableporter
case
in
our
brief
where
a
juror's
son
applied
for
a
job
with
the
defense.
and
our
court
said,
“that's
implied
bias.”
he
implied
for
a
job
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
true
it's
only
a
municipal
court
decision,
but
it's
the
only
one
i
found
in
new
york
that
is
at
all
similar
to
what
we
have.
i
might
just
add
in
--
in
closing
because
i
see
the
orange
light,
that
we
have
submitted
a
number
of
cases,
very,
very
extremely
recent
ones.
in
hawk
against
the
state
in
indiana,
i
think
it
is
the
proper
rule
where
a
juror's
husband
had
been
offered
a
job
with
the
district
attorney's
office
and
she
knew
only
his
application
was
pending
and
they
held
that
was
an
implied
bias.
we
don't
think
that
2254(d)
applies
that
the
(inaudible)
case
has
any
applicability
here.
it's
a
wholly
different
situation
then
our
case
and
--
in
reading
the
case,
it's
mentioned
quite
prominently
in
their
brief,
we
didn't
mention
it
because
we
didn't
think
it
was
just
all
applicable
in
this
case.
we
don't
think
the
remmer
type
hearing
is
sufficient
here,
you
have
a
serious
situation
where
you
have
a
juror
who
is
expecting
a
favor,
hoping
for
a
favor
and
it's
more
important
in
this
case
because
he
is
seeking
a
job.
i
wouldn't
feel
as
strong
or
i'd
be
almost
as
strong
if
he
had
the
job
already
because
i
think
it's
harder
to
be
fired
for
voting
not
guilty
than
it
is
to
be
hired.
i
think
the
standards
are
totally
different
in
this
situation.
we've
raised
the
appearance
of
justice
standard.
i
think,
i
don't
have
to
believe
at
that
point.
i
think
it's
obvious,
is
this
man
any
different
than
the
judge
in
tumey's
case,
who
was
going
to
get
a
financial
benefit.
what
if
you
had
a
hearing
there,
and
he
said,
“i
perfectly
fair.
even
though
i
share
him
the
proceeds,
i'd
be
perfectly
fair
in
this
case.”
i
don't
think
this
court
would
accept
that
anymore
than
it
did
in
tumey.
in
rose
against
mitchell,
this
court
said,
“the
harm
is
not
only
to
the
accused
but
to
society
as
a
whole
when
the
appearance
of
justice
is
destroyed.”
and
i
know
you
can
stop
a
hundred
people
on
the
streets
in
washington
d.c.
and
say,
“do
you
think
it's
fair
that
a
juror
in
a
capital
case
has
an
application
pending
with
the
district
attorney?
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
fair
juror?”
and
i
would
be
very
seriously
surprised
if
anyone
of
those
100
or
1000
or
10,000
would
say,
“that's
fair
to
me.”
i
just
think
upfronts
the
entire
law
to
hold
that
a
juror
like
that
should
sit
on
the
juror
in
a
capital
case,
and
that
the
prosecutor
should
withhold
the
information.
i
like
the
prophylactic
standard
that
the
second
circuit
hindered
that
in
its
decision.
i
think
it's
--
there
are
some
cases
where
the
prosecutor
does
deserve
to
have
a
new
trial.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
interestingly
enough,
the
appellate
division
affirmed
without
opinion.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
judge
birns
was
one.
the
appellate
division
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
he
didn't
say,
yes,
he
would
be
one
out
of
my
10,000.
i
agree
--
i
agree
with
that.
i
--
i
wouldn't
ask
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
we
had
five
there.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
they
did
too.
but
then
on
the
same
position,
justice
white
–
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--
because
they
are
seeking
to
--
and
--
and
to
avoid
the
enormous
expense
in
setting
aside
of
a
jury
verdict
which
is
very
hard,
the
ordinary
person
that's
on
the
appearance
of
justice
--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--
is
not
a
judge
and
isn't
sitting
on
this
kind
of
a
situation.
so,
i
wouldn't
have
gone
to
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
