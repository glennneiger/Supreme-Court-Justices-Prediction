this
is
irrelevant,
but
your
statute
is
not
the
most
artfully
drawn
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
just
looking
at
the
last
sentence.
if,
and
this
is
not
this
case,
if
no
alternate
juror
is
available,
such
trial
juror
may
not
be
discharged,
and
the
trial
must
proceed
and
yet
he
might
have
been
found
to
be
grossly
unqualified
to
serve.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
a
good
thing
that
case
is
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
you
were
trying
the
case,
(inaudible)
the
juror,
i
bet
you'd
use
a
peremptory
right
quick.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
lost
out
in
the
cause
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
