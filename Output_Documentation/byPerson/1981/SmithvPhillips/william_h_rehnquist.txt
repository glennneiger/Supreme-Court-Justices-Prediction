justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
judge
pierce's
grant
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
on
the
same
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
--
then
he
would
have
risk,
i
suppose,
if
the
defense
hadn't
consented
to
it
a
charge
of
double
jeopardy
if
he
tried
to
go
ahead
with
the
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
pitler,
in
the
case
of
the
application
of
270.35,
if
the
judge
determines
somewhere
in
the
course
of
the
trial
that
a
juror
is
actually
bias
and
says,
“i'm
going
to
remove
this
juror
and
substitute
an
alternate.”
does
that
require
to
the
consent
of
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
--
then,
wouldn't
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
argue
on
appeal
under
new
york
courts
that
the
judge
improperly
applied
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
he
applying
for
a
job
too
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
in
the
same
office?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kunstler,
do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
somewhat
different
than
the
reasoning
of
judge
pierce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
--
those
are
the
state
statutes.
i
mean
you've
got
to
find
the
violation
of
a
federal
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
without
the
statute
there
would
be
no
due
process
violation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
smith
against
phillips
comes
here
from
the
second
circuit
on
federal
habeas
petition.
the
respondent
was
convicted
of
murder
by
a
new
york
state
jury.
during
his
trial
one
of
the
jurors
applied
to
the
district
attorney's
office
for
employment
for
employment
as
a
major
felony
investigator.
when
the
attorneys
prosecuting
respondent
learned
that
one
of
the
jurors
had
applied
for
such
employment
in
their
office,
they
took
steps
to
ensure
that
the
juror
would
not
be
contacted
by
the
office
but
concluded
that
there
was
no
need
to
inform
the
trial
court
or
defense
counsel
of
his
application.
four
days
after
the
trial,
the
district
attorney
himself
learned
of
the
application
and
promptly
informed
the
trial
judge
and
defense
counsel.
defense
counsel
thereupon
moved
to
set
aside
the
verdict
which
had
been
returned
in
the
interim.
in
response,
the
trial
judge
held
a
hearing
at
which
the
prosecuting
attorneys
explained
their
decision
not
to
disclose
the
application
and
the
juror
explained
that
he
had
seen
nothing
improper
in
submitting
the
application
during
the
trial.
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
presented
at
this
hearing,
the
trial
judge
found
in
his
words,
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt"
that
the
juror's
application
would
not
affected
the
verdict.
the
trial
judge
also
found
that
that
the
prosecutors
have
acted
in
a
good
faith.
respondent
then
filed
then
filed
a
petition
for
federal
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
court
of
new
york
claiming
that
the
juror's
applicant
resulted
in
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
district
court
found
insufficient
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
the
juror
was
actually
biased
by
the
application
to
the
district
attorney's
office,
but
nonetheless,
imputed
bias
to
the
juror
because
of
its
conclusion
that
the
"average
person"
would
have
been
influenced
by
the
application.
the
district
court's
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
not
on
the
basis
of
imputed
juror
bias
but
because
of
the
court
of
appeals’
conclusion
that
the
prosecutors
acted
improperly
in
failing
to
disclose
the
fact
to
the
juror's
application.
today
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
remedy
for
allegations
of
juror
impartiality
in
a
--
is
a
hearing
like
the
one
held
in
state
court
in
this
case
in
which
the
defendant
has
the
opportunity
to
prove
actual
juror
bias.
if
such
a
hearing
has
been
held
and
the
state
court
has
determined
that
no
prejudice
occurred
a
federal
court
errs
by
imputing
bias
to
the
juror.
in
cases
of
alleged
prosecutorial
misconduct
the
touchstone
of
due
process
analysis
is
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
not
the
culpability
of
the
prosecutor.
since
the
state
trial
court
found
that
respondent's
trial
was
fair,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
setting
aside
the
conviction
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
prosecutors'
conduct.
justice
o'connor
who
joins
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
statement.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
stevens.
