mr.
e.
richard
larson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
initially
i
will
respond
to
the
government's
characterization
of
several
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
thereafter,
unless
this
court
chooses
otherwise,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
standing
issue
that
was
raised
by
the
court,
and
then
to
the
three
issues
that
have
been
raised
by
the
government,
the
absolute
immunity
issue,
which
was
ruled
upon
and
rejected
by
the
court
below,
and
then
the
two
other
issues
which
were
not
ruled
on
by
either
court
below.
first,
as
to
the
characterization,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
respondents
in
this
case
charged
the
petitioners
with
refusing
to
take
any
enforcement
action
whatsoever
against
petitioners'
discriminatory
grantees.
no
enforcement
action.
more
particularly,
as
to
administrative
fund
termination
proceedings,
petitioners
in
this
case
exercised
no
discretionary
enforcement
functions.
they
did
not
function
with
discretion
in
initiating
fund
termination
proceedings,
and
i
will
elaborate
on
all
of
these.
specifically,
i
mean,
under
the
regulations
in
effect
at
the
time
that
this
action
was
brought,
indeed,
as
described
by
petitioner
velde
and
set
forth
in
the
record
in
this
case,
the
regulations
required
leaa
to
pursue
court
action
and
not
administrative
action
to
resolve
matters
of
employment
discrimination.
petitioners'
deliberate
decision
to
take
away
this
enforcement
discretion
has
deprived
them
of
the
discretionary
function
to
enforce
administratively
their
statute.
this
policy
decision,
this
refusal
to
act,
also
meant
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
exceeded
the
statutory
authority
that
had
been
placed
upon
them
by
section
518(c)(3)
of
the
crime
control
act.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
charge
that
petitioners'
refusal
to
enforce,
coupled
with
their
affirmative
provision
of
continuous
funding
to
grantees
which
petitioners
knew
were
discriminatory
constituted
a
direct
violation
of
petitioners'
fifth
amendment
steer
clear
obligation,
the
obligation
to
steer
clear
of
providing
significant
aid
to
discriminatory
institutions.
this
case,
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
indicated,
was
dismissed
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
as
we
point
out
also,
there
was
no
discovery
in
this
case
whatsoever.
we
were
denied
discovery.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
just
affidavits.
we
filed
discovery
in
the
trial
court.
the
government
moved
for
a
stay
and
obtained
a
stay
on
the
discovery.
we
moved
to
vacate
the
stay.
the
government
opposed
our
stay.
the
trial
court
never
ruled.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
let
me
respond
to
that.
there
are
two
views
of
standing
on
this
case,
and
you
are
discussing
the
view
of
standing
that
judge
tam
took,
looked
at
in
the
court
below,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
indeed,
he
found
that
we
had
standing
under
that
view
with
regard
to
redressability,
with
regard
to
the
cutoff
of
funds.
i
mean,
this
is
even
apart
from
the
fifth
amendment
obligation
and
the
violation
that
we
referred
to
with
the
federal
petitioners.
but
on
redressability,
simply
focusing
on
the
police
departments,
we
think
that
there
is
more
than
a
substantial
likelihood
that
indeed
the
grantees
would
end
their
discrimination
rather
than
lose
their
money.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
three
branches,
the
three
coordinate
branches
of
the
federal
government
have
already
recognized
the
coercive
power
of
fund
termination.
two
courts
of
appeals
have
held
it.
the
executive
has
recognized
it
on
occasion.
and
indeed
congress,
in
enacting
section
518(c),
did
so
because
it
recognized
the
coercive
power
of
fund
termination.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
with
regard
to
injury,
economic
injury,
on--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--it
is
generally
in
the
complaint,
yes.
now,
it
also
is
on
the
record,
justice
rehnquist.
i
should
point
out
that
one
plaintiff
in
this
case
has
already
established
standing
as
a
matter
of
the
record
in
this
case.
plaintiff
shumacher
is
from
new
orleans.
in
1978,
these
petitioners
had
found
the
new
orleans
police
department
to
be
discriminatory
and
in
violation
of
section
518(c),
yet
for
two
and
a
half
years
leaa
did
nothing.
in
september
of
1974...
'75,
we
filed
this
lawsuit.
immediately
thereafter
the
leaa
petitioners
in
this
case
sent
a
letter
to
the
superintendent
of
police
in
new
orleans
stating...
not
indicating
they
had
just
recently
been
sued,
but
indicating...
stating
straight
out,
and
this
is
in
the
record,
that
we
now
are
going
to
compel
you
to
come
into
compliance
immediately
or
we
are
going
to
terminate
your
funds.
within
weeks
a
letter
comes
back
from
the
superintendent
of
police
in
new
orleans
stating,
we
have
now
eliminated
the
discriminatory
practice,
under
duress,
and
only
because
of
your
threat
to
cancel
our
funding.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
as
this
court
held
only
last
week
in
watt
v.
energy
action
unanimously
per
justice
o'connor,
only
one
plaintiff
need
have
standing
in
order
to
maintain
the
action
that
we
maintain.
indeed,
i
mean
watt
is
instructive
on
another
matter,
too.
watt...
in
watt
this
court
recognized
that
the
standing
argument
which
is
being
raised
here
is
based
upon
an
improper
assumption
about
government
activity,
the
improper
assumption
being
that
local
governments
are
going
to
look
money
in
the
face
and
then
walk
away
from
it.
that
is
an
improper
assumption,
and
indeed,
as
we
have
already
demonstrated
conclusively
on
this
record,
with
regard
to
plaintiff
shumacher,
the
government,
local
grantees
will
not
walk
away
from
that
money.
they
will
stop
their
discrimination.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
certainly
think
we
should
have
an
opportunity
on
discovery
to
prove
that,
as
judge
tam
held
in
his
separate
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
let's
point
out
that
before
this
complaint
was
filed,
leaa
petitioners,
these
government
officials
never,
never
initiated
fund
termination
proceedings.
after
this
case
was
filed,
as
we
pointed
out
in
january
of
1976,
we
filed
a
preliminary
injunction
asking
leaa
to
finally
initiate
fund
termination
proceedings
against
the
philadelphia
police
department,
where
leaa
two
years
earlier
had
made
a
determination
of
discrimination
but
had
done
nothing.
in
response
to
our
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
a
letter
went
out
to
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
to
initiate
indeed
the
fund
termination
proceedings.
i
believe
that
if
we
were
given
the
opportunity
of
discovery
in
this
case
we
could
show
that
after
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit,
that
every
time
that
fund
termination
was
actually
threatened,
that
indeed
the
local
grantees
rolled
over
and
said,
we
will
stop
our
discrimination.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
assistance
here
is
considered
quite
substantial
by
the
grantee
police
departments.
they
keep
coming
back
and
asking
for
the
money.
indeed,
the
assistance
is
considered
to
be
so
substantial
by
leaa
that
they
have
exceeded
their
statutory
power
just
to
continue
the
assistance
going.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it
is
a
grant
in
aid
program,
and
of
course
one
of
the
conditions
of
this
grant
in
aid
program
is
that
the
grantee
comply
with
leaa
regulations
and
with
the
non
discrimination
requirement.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
are
claiming--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--oh,
absolutely.
i
mean,
our
complaint
with
regard
to
each
plaintiff,
it
says,
both
with
the
short
description
of
the
plaintiffs
and
then
in
the
statement
of
the
case
as
to
each
plaintiff,
we
have
claimed
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
we
have
been...
that
each
plaintiff
has
been
discriminated
against.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
component
of
the
fifth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
it
is,
absolutely.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
we
are,
but
that
is
an
issue
which
was
not
presented
or
has
not
been
presented
by
the
government
in
its
cert
petition
and
it
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
issue
has
never
been
raised
prior
to
the
supplemental
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
first
time.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
before
judgment,
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it
was
not,
no.
it
was
assumed
that
we
have
a
bivens
cause
of
action.
indeed
the
government
in
its
brief
has
stated
that
the
action
here...
they
don't
challenge
our
bivens,
carlson-green
cause
of
action.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
in
1976.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes.
much
of
the
legislative
history
is
set
forth
in
our
separate
appendix
in
our
brief.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
there
was
tremendous
frustration
in
congress
with
the
absolute
refusal
by
petitioners
to
enforce
the
mandate
that
congress
had
imposed
on
officials--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--as
one
member
of
congress
stated,
even
if
leaa
continues
to
do
nothing,
we
at
least
have
added
additional
triggers
that
will
initiate
and
require
the
fund
cutoff
that
congress
had
imposed
in
1973.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
there
may
be
a
claim.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
very
good
damage
claim
on
that.
i
mean,
this
is
a
race
and
sex
discrimination
claim
with
regard
to
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
on
those
allegations,
i
am
not
sure,
but
where
race
and
sex
have
been
alleged,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
court--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--but
the
difference
is
the
nature
of
the
invidious
discrimination,
the
race
and
sex
discrimination.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
but
certainly
subject
to
a
different
standard
of
review
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
are
claiming
that
they
exceeded
their
statutory
powers,
the
statutory
powers
set
out
in
section
518(c),
which
make
the
initiation
of
fund
termination
procedures
non
discretionary,
and
that
by
their
refusal
to
cut
off
funds
or
have
any
civil
rights
enforcement
program
coupled
with
their
affirmative,
continuous
funding
of
police
departments
that
they
knew
to
be
discriminatory,
yes,
these
petitioners
have
invidiously
discriminated
against
the
respondents
in
this
case.
that
is
the
allegation
in
our
complaint.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
know
that
legislative
history
fairly
well,
justice
blackmun.
i
am
not
sure.
with
regard
to
the
'76
conference
report?
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
i
can't
recall
what
it
says
right
now.
with
regard
to
the
standing
argument,
to
finish
up,
indeed,
there
are
two
perspectives
on
standing.
we
believe
under
judge
tam's
perspective
that
we
have
already
conclusively
demonstrated
on
this
record
that
we
do
have
standing.
let
me
point
out
that
these
documents,
these
post
filing
documents
with
regard
to
plaintiff
shumacher
appear
in
some
of
the
attachments
to
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
were
not
able,
because
we
have
never
had
discovery,
to
obtain
this
information,
but
i
think
it
was
inadvertently
attached
to
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss,
so
that
is
how
it
got
into
the
record.
we
nonetheless
maintain
that
with
regard
to
the
majority
opinion
below,
that
we
also
have
standing
directly
against...
with
regard
to
redress
directly
under
the
fifth
amendment
against
the
petitioners
here.
we
have
claimed
that
the
respondents,
the
plaintiffs
below,
were
harmed
through
pain
and
suffering
and
through
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights,
and
we
have
sought
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
and
in
our
view
those
damages
would
indeed
redress
the
past
wrongs
that
have
been
committed
by
the
leaa
officials
in
this
case.
we
also--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--they
are
not
in
government
any
more,
but
as
this
court
has--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--as
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out,
awards
of
punitive
damages
pose
a
very
strong
deterrent
effect
to
unconstitutional
action
by
government
officials,
and
we
believe
particularly--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
they
violated
the
constitution.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
they
did
so
wilfully
and
maliciously
in
our
view,
and
we
are
entitled
to--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--i
think
when
you
read
the
entire
complaint...
i
don't
think
we
have
to
say
wilful
and
malicious
in
every
paragraph.
what
we
do
say
in
virtually
every
paragraph
is
that
the
petitioners
refused,
refused.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
we
did
say
it
at
least
twice.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
don't
have
to
say
it
in
every
paragraph.
we
have
met
the
basic
rules
of
pleading
under
rule
8a
of
stating
jurisdiction
provided--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--because
of
our
two
different
claims
on
standing,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
below
on
either
theory
of
standing.
the
government's
first
argument
in
this
case
is
an
argument
in
which
they
contend
that
all
of
the
petitioners
are
protected
by
an
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity.
we
submit
that
this
contention
directly
contravenes
this
court's
decision
in
butz.
most
important
is
the
record
in
this
case.
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
outset,
the
government
petitioners
uniformly
adhered
to
an
unlawful
regulation
which
petitioner
velde
stated
in
this
record
that
that...
that
those
regulations
require
leaa
to
pursue
court
action
and
not
administrative
action
to
resolve
matters
of
employment
discrimination.
indeed,
that
regulation
and
the
interpretation
of
that
regulation
were
uniformly
followed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
there
never
was
an
initiation
of
administrative
fund
termination
proceedings
until
this
case
was
filed.
after
this
case
was
filed,
the
unlawful
regulation
was
ultimately
repealed,
and
pursuant
to
our
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
general
deterrent
effect
of
bringing
a
damage
action,
petitioners
began
to
enforce,
but
prior
to
this,
they
didn't.
in
other
words,
they
did
not
have
any
discretion
that
might
even
be
described
as
prosecutorial
discretion
because
they
had
deprived
themselves
of
that
discretion
to
go
forward.
indeed,
in
their
affidavits,
their
pre
butz
affidavits,
the
government
petitioners
in
this
case
nowhere
described
their
functions
as
prosecutorial.
they
described
themselves
as
administrators,
and
they
described
their
policymaking
functions.
indeed,
no
petitioner
in
the
affidavits
any
place
claimed
responsibility
for
not
initiating
administrative
proceedings
in
this
case.
of
course,
to
do
so
would
have
been
exactly
what
we
have
charged
the
petitioners
with,
and
that
is
exceeding
their
statutory
authority
under
section
518(c).
the
legislative
history,
as
justice
blackmun
points
out,
is
as
obvious
and
clear
as
the
statute
itself.
the
statute
says
that
whenever
the
administration
makes
the
determination,
it
shall
move
forward
and
initiate
the
administrative
proceedings.
that
was
violated
here,
and
accordingly
not
only
did
we
allege
that
the
petitioners,
the
government
petitioners
had
violated
the
fifth
amendment,
but
indeed
they
had
exceeded
the
scope
of
their
duty
under
their
statute.
with
regard
to--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
after
we
filed
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
with
regard
to
philadelphia,
they
did
so.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
there
is
not.
of
their
refusal
to
follow
their
statute
and
initiate?
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
not
for
an
individual
claimant.
there
is
no
procedure
whatsoever
under
this
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
with
regard
to
a
grantee,
a
grantee
has
under
section
509,
510,
511
of
the
act,
does
have
administrative
review
of
the
record
on
that
particular
action.
there
is
a
hearing.
there
can
be
a
rehearing,
and
there
also
is
judicial
review.
the
government's
second
argument
which
was
not
raised
below
or
ruled
on
below
is
that
the
respondents
here
do
not
have
a
fifth
amendment
cause
of
action.
as
this
court
pointed
out
earlier,
we
believe
that
this
is
basically
a
statement
of
proof.
it
is
a
question
going
to
proof,
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
discovery,
and
a
proof
argument
simply
cannot
be
turned
into
a
pleading
argument,
and
our
pleadings
are
more
than
adequate
to
state
a
fifth
amendment
cause
of
action,
as
the
government
even
concedes
under
bivens
and
under
davis
particularly,
and
also
under
carlson.
finally,
the
government
argues
that
this
case
could
have
been
decided
on
summary
judgment,
and
that
this
court
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
should
act
as
a
trier
of
fact
and
rule
on
a
summary
judgment
motion
that
was
not
ruled
on
by
either
court
below.
we
submit
that
it
would
have
been
wrong
for
the
trial
court
to
have
ruled
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue
on
summary
judgment
had
it
been
filed
in
the
trial
court,
and
indeed,
it
would
be
improper
for
this
court
to
address
this
issue
for
the
first
time
here.
but
particularly
disturbing,
indeed,
i
found
particularly
astounding
is
the
government's
argument
that
the
normal
civil...
the
rules
that
govern
normal
civil
litigation
do
not
apply
with
equal
force
in
bivens
actions
against
federal
officials.
indeed,
in
butz
v.
economou,
this
court
held
that
the
standards
that
apply
to
state
officials
apply
with
equal
import
to
federal
officials,
and
indeed
in
butz
this
court
specifically
invoked
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
holding
that
a
good
faith
immunity
on
summary
judgment
is
subject
to
a
properly
supported
motion
for
summary
judgment.
indeed,
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
this
issue
with
regard
to
the
application
of
rule
56
standards
to
the
government,
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
rule
56
expressly
state
in
the
very
first
sentence,
this
rule
is
applicable
to
all
actions,
including
those
against
the
united
states,
or
an
officer
or
agency
thereof.
as
we
have
pointed
out
quite
extensively
in
our
brief,
it
would
have
been
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
court
below
if
it
had
been
asked
to
rule
on
qualified
immunity
to
have
granted
qualified
immunity
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
on
this
record.
rule
56
was
not
complied
with
by
the
government.
for
these
reasons,
your
honors,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below
should
be
affirmed,
and
the
government's
arguments
in
this
case
rejected.
we
also
believe
for
the
reasons
that
i
point
out
that
there
is
standing
in
this
case,
that
indeed
one
plaintiff
has
already
conclusively
demonstrated
standing,
and
under
many
of
this
court's
decisions,
including
the
unanimous
decision
last
week,
in
watt
v.
energy
action,
there
is
standing
in
this
case.
