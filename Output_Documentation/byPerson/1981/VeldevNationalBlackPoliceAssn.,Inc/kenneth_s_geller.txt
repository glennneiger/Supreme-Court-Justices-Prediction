mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
constitutional
damages
action,
so
called
bivens
action
against
former
attorney
general
edward
levi,
former
head
of
the
law
enforcement
assistance
administration,
richard
velde,
and
two
former
subordinate
leaa
officials,
charles
work
and
herbert
rice.
the
plaintiffs
are
six
blacks
and
six
women,
and
an
organization
that
represents
black
police
officers.
plaintiffs
filed
this
lawsuit
in
september,
1975,
claiming
that
a
number
of
police
organizations
that
received
leaa
monetary
grants
were
engaging
in
race
and
sex
discrimination
in
employment.
plaintiffs
allege
that
the
defendants'
failure
to
institute
administrative
proceedings
under
the
leaa
statute
to
cut
off
federal
funds
to
these
organizations
violated
their
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
for
this
alleged
constitutional
violation,
plaintiffs
demanded
that
the
four
defendants
pay
them
$20
million
in
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
official
immunity
from
these
personal
damage
claims.
however,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed
by
a
two
to
one
vote.
the
majority
recognized
that
this
court
in
butz
versus
economou
had
held
that
administrative
officials
who
perform
functions
analogous
to
that
of
a
prosecutor
are
absolutely
immune
from
personal
damages
liability,
even
when
constitutional
claims
are
involved.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
however,
that
attorney
general
levi
and
the
other
defendants
were
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
here,
because
under
the
leaa
statute
as
the
court
read
it
they
had
virtually
no
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
terminate
leaa
funding
to
recipients
who
were
alleged
to
have
engaged
in
discrimination.
now,
the
department
of
justice
has
brought
this
case
to
this
court
because
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
seriously
misconstrues
governing
legal
principles
not
only
of
absolute
immunity
for
federal
officials
but
also
of
what
governmental
action
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
have
not
raised
standing
as
a
separate
issue
in
this
case,
although
we
do
think
that
the
failure
of
these
plaintiffs
to
show
how
the
defendant's
actions
violated
their
constitutional
rights
shows
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
not
allege
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
and
we
have
raised
that
question.
we
have
raised
as
our
second
question
the
failure
of
the
complaint
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
we
have
discussed
simon
in
our
brief,
in
the
section
of
the
brief
that
is
devoted
to
showing
why
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
said
that,
i
think,
in
our
petition,
but
on
further
reading
of
the
case,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
judge
tam
did
not
find
there
was
standing
as
to
the
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
now
tell
this
court
they
are
raising.
i
think
judge
tam
misconstrued
plaintiffs'
complaint
as
alleging
that
they
were
harmed
by
the
actions
of
the
grantees,
and
what
judge
tam
said
was,
well,
he
thinks
under
cases
like
simon
versus
eastern
kentucky
the
plaintiffs
are
at
least
entitled
to
a
trial
to
show
that
if
the
federal
government
had
not
terminated...
had
terminated
funding,
it
would
have
had
some
effect
on
the
actions
of
the
grantees--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
but
as
i
reread
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
just
the
other
day,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
judge
tam
is
saying
that
as
to
the
claimant,
the
plaintiffs
now
tell
the
court
they
are
raising,
which
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
discrimination
allegedly
practiced
by
the
grantees,
but
only
focuses
on
the
federal
government's
failure
to
enforce
the
laws,
he
says
that
is
essentially
a
citizen
standing
suit,
and
he
does
not
agree
that
these
plaintiffs
have
standing.
i
was
explaining
to
the
court
why
the
federal
government
thinks
this
case
is
so
important.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
think
that
the
case
should
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
whether
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action
under
the
fifth
amendment.
we
think
that
is
the
proper
analysis,
if
the
court
decides
that
the
conduct--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
really
depends
upon
how
the
court
analyzes
the
duties
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
area.
i
agree.
it
can
be
stated
in
terms
of
standing,
and
as
i--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
would
like--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think,
as
justice
rehnquist
was
alluding
to,
that
if
there
is
no
standing
here,
then
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
under
article
3
of
the
constitution,
because
there
is
no
case
or
controversy,
and
we
have
cited
the
relevant
cases
in
the
portion
of
our
brief,
and
made,
i
think,
the
relevant
arguments
that
would
be
addressed
in
a
standing
issue,
but
we
have
placed
it
in
the
section
of
our
brief
that
is
addressed
to
whether
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action.
i
think
the
analysis
is
very,
very
similar,
and
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
find
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
hence
no
standing,
because
the
actions
of
these
defendants
did
not
cause
any
harm
to
these
plaintiffs--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--right.
now,
we
have
presented
three
independent
reasons
why
the
decision
below
is
wrong.
first,
we
claim
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
the
absolute
immunity
recognized
in
butz
versus
economou
for
administrative
prosecutors.
second,
as
i
just
explained,
we
contend
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action
against
these
defendants
under
the
due
process
clause,
the
fifth
amendment.
finally,
even
if
the
complaint
could
be
construed
to
state
a
due
process
claim,
because
the
defendants
acted
in
good
faith
and
had
no
reason
to
know
that
their
actions
were
unconstitutional,
they
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law
and
should
not
be
forced
to
undergo
a
trial.
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
one
of
official
immunity.
in
butz
against
economou,
this
court
held
that
government
officials
who
must
decide
whether
or
when
to
initiate
administrative
proceedings
play
a
role
similar
to
that
of
a
prosecutor
who
must
decide
whether
or
not
to
press
criminal
charges.
for
this
reason,
the
court
held
that
administrative
officials,
like
a
prosecutor,
are
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
from
personal
damages
claims,
even
when
constitutional
claims
are
involved.
this
immunity,
the
court
said,
is
essential
to
ensure
that
agency
officials
may
exercise
their
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
bring
the
weight
of
the
federal
government
against
some
respondent
for
an
alleged
violation
of
the
law,
should
be
made
free
from
the
intimidation
that
is
inevitably
associated
with
the
possibility
of
personal
damages
liability
in
the
event
that
someone
is
unhappy
with
that
decision
to
charge
or
not
to
charge.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
defendants
collectively
were
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
enforcing
the
leaa
statute,
including
the
anti
discrimination
provisions,
and
that
when
faced
with
an
allegation
of
discrimination
by
a
fund
recipient,
they
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
start
administrative
proceedings
to
cut
off
further
federal
funding.
defendants
had
to
decide
whether
a
charge
of
discrimination
was
likely
to
have
merit,
whether
the
discrimination
alleged
was
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
the
expenditure
of
leaa's
scarce
investigative
and
prosecutorial
resources,
whether
the
ultimate
sanction
of
partial
or
complete
fund
termination
was
the
best
way
of
achieving
the
goal
of
ending
discrimination.
we
submit
that
these
are
precisely
the
sort
of
decisions
this
court
had
in
mind
in
economou
when
it
referred
to
agency
officials
performing
functions
analogous
to
that
of
a
prosecutor.
now,
the
only
reason
that
the
d.
c.
circuit
offered
for
refusing
to
accord
the
defendants
absolute
immunity
was
that
the
defendants
in
the
court's
view
had
virtually
no
discretion
under
the
leaa
statute
in
deciding
whether
to
institute
fund
termination
proceedings.
i
suppose
judge
basilon
in
his
opinion
for
the
d.
c.
circuit
viewed
the
leaa
officials
as
essentially
clerks.
once
a
charge
of
discrimination
came
in,
they
were
supposed
to
follow
each
succeeding
step
until
the
end,
and
if
in
the
end
they
determined
there
was
substantial
discrimination,
they
had
no
discretion
other
than
to
cut
off
funding,
and
i
suppose
this
would
be
the
case
regardless
of
how
many
complaints
were
filed,
and
regardless
of
how
scarce
the
prosecutor's
resources
were.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
complaint
raised
a
number
of
causes
of
action
under
section
1981,
under
executive
orders.
the
only
cause
of
action
that
currently
exists
in
this
court
is
the
one
directly
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
implied
cause
of
action
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
bivens
and
davis
against
passman.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
the
argument
that
was
pushed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
although
the
court
of
appeals
decision
does
not
address
it
at
all,
is
that
using
the
analysis
the
court
later
adopted
in
carlson
against
green,
that
there
should
not
be
a
cause
of
action
implied
here
under
the
fifth
amendment.
we
have
not
presented
that
argument
here
because
there
is
a
threshold
question
before
you
reach
the
carlson
versus
green
analysis,
which
is
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
at
all.
cases
like
bivens
and
carlson--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
but
this
court
in
davis
against
passman
has
held
that
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
there
is
an
implied--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
understand,
and
there
is
an
argument
in--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
understand
that.
i
think
it
is
more
logical,
though,
to
ask
the
question
first
whether
the
constitution
has
been
violated.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
this
case
we
think
there
is
a
very
easy
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
think
cases
like
bivens
and
carlson
against
green
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
a
constitutional
violation.
the
question
in
those
cases
was,
should
there
be
an
implied
damages
action
implied
by
this
court.
the
predicate
for
those
decisions
was
that
the
constitution
had
been
violated.
here,
we
contest
whether
the
constitution
has
been
violated,
and
we
have
raised
that
question
in
our
petition.
i
agree
with
the
court
that
there
is
a
separate
issue
available
in
this
case,
whether,
assuming
the
constitution
has
been
violated,
an
implied
cause
of
action
for
damages
should
exist.
that
is
an
issue
we
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
have
not
chosen
to
raise
it
in
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
number
of
errors
in
its
opinion.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
for
example,
on
the
question
of
mootness.
we
have
chosen
to
restrict
the
questions
presented
in
our
petition
to
the
three
i
have
previously
expressed,
and
we
do
not
disagree
with
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
would
be,
i
think,
on
behalf
of
the
defendants,
they
would
be
delighted
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
bivens
action
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case
as
well.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think,
though,
that
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
cases
like
carlson
against
green,
davis
against
passman,
it
is
a
more
difficult
analysis.
we
think
the
easier
question
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
simply
no
constitutional
violation
at
all.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
the
only
reason
that
the
d.
c.
circuit
found
that
these
defendants
were
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
is
because,
as
the
court
read
the
statute,
there
was
absolutely
no
discretion
involved.
we
think
that...
you
know,
judge
tam
dissented
on
this
point,
and
we
think
his
dissent
is
clearly
correct.
under
section
518
(c)(2)
of
the
leaa
statute,
defendants
had
to
make
an
initial
determination
whether
a
recipient
of
federal
funds
"failed
to
comply
with
the
non
discrimination
provisions
of
the
leaa
statute
and
regulations.
"
this
often
involved
difficult
questions
of
law
and
allocation
of
leaa
resources,
and
if
the
defendants
did
decide
to
investigate
a
complaint
and
found
evidence
of
discrimination,
then
under
the
statute
they
had
to
notify
the
grantee
state's
governor
and
had
to
decide
whether
the
grantee
"within
a
reasonable
time"
had
taken
appropriate
steps
to
comply
with
the
statute
voluntarily.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
don't
think
it
can,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
the
complaint
is
very,
very
poorly
drafted
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
identify
which
of
the
defendants
is
alleged
to
have
done
what.
it
simply
refers
repeatedly
to
the
defendants,
but
we
think
that
in
a
bivens
action
in
which
defendants
may
ultimately
have
to
pay
damages,
it
is
essential
that
each
defendant
be
identified
and
it
would
be
clearly
explained
in
the
complaint
what
action
that
defendant
took
that
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
plaintiffs
have
attempted
to
rewrite
their
complaint
since
this
litigation
began,
i
think
because
they
realized
the
deficiencies
of
the
complaint,
but
the
only
allegation
alleged
in
this
complaint
that
is
claimed--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
am
reading
from
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
complaint
is
reprinted,
starting
on
page
13.
the
only
allegation
of
the
defendant's
conduct
that
is
alleged
to
have
violated
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights
in
this
complaint
is
the
failure
to
terminate
federal
funding.
on
page
13,
under
the
nature
of
the
claim,
the
complaint
says,
plaintiffs
allege
that
the
defendants
have
awarded
excess
of
a
certain
figure
in
dollars
to
law
enforcement
agencies,
federal
funding
which
has
been
used
to
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
and
sex.
that
is
the
only
allegation
of
harm.
and
then,
on
pages--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
on
pages--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
understand
that
there
are
a
lot
of
allegations
in
the
complaint
about
what
collectively
the
defendants
did,
but
i
am
trying
to
focus
on
what
the
plaintiffs
have
described
as
their
constitutional
harm,
and
on
pages
14
and
15
of
the
complaint,
where
each
of
the
plaintiffs
is
identified,
and
each
of
the
plaintiffs
specifically
states
how
he
or
she
was
harmed,
in
every
single
instance
the
only
harm
that
is
identified
is
the
refusal
to
terminate
leaa
funding,
and
i
might
add
that
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
complaint
in
that
fashion.
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
where
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
reprinted,
the
very
beginning
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
on
page
2a,
judge
basilon
says
that
the
plaintiffs
allege
that
federal
agencies
and
officials
unlawfully
failed
to
terminate
federal
funding.
that
is
the
only
allegation
of
what
the
constitutional
violation
was
here,
and
judge
tam
agrees
with--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
understand
that
that
is
what
they--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
is
how
the
plaintiffs
have
described
the
defendant's
action.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
what
they
allege,
but
the
only
constitutional
action
that
the
defendants
are
alleged
to
have
taken
here
that
caused
constitutional
harm
was
the
failure
to
terminate
funding,
and
judge
tam
on
page
17a
agrees
with
that
description,
and
therefore
we
think
that
since
that
is
clearly
a
discretionary
determination
under
the
statute,
that
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
wade
through
the
rest
of
the
plaintiff's
prolix
complaint
to
see
what
other
grievances
they
have
stated.
the
only
cause
of
action
here
is
for
a
failure
to
terminate
funding.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
would,
but
i
think
it
is
important
even
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
standing.
i
think
we
have
to
determine
what
it
is
they
have
alleged
as
their
cause
of
action
in
order
to
determine
whether
these
are
people
who
can
raise
that
sort
of
a
cause
of
action
against
these
defendants,
and
i
think
that
therefore
it
is
an
important
point,
because
the
plaintiffs
had
tried
to
obscure
the
point
in
their
briefs
that
the
only
constitutional
violation
alleged
in
this
complaint
is
the
failure
to
initiate
fund
termination
proceedings.
now,
we
have
raised
two
issues
other
than
official
absolute
immunity
in
this
court.
they
are
described
in
the
brief
at
some
length.
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time,
in
light
of
the
limited
time
i
have
available,
discussing
the
cause
of
action
argument,
which
we
have
already
alluded
to.
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
could,
to
the
final
point
in
our
brief,
which
is
in
some
ways
perhaps
the
most
important
one,
and
that
is
the
question
of
qualified
immunity.
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
on
this
record,
we
think
the
court
should
have
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
record
clearly
shows
they
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law.
when
this
court
decided
butz
against
economou,
that
federal
officials
ordinarily
would
have
only
qualified
immunity
from
personal
damages
liability
in
bivens
actions,
it
did
so
on
the
expressed
assumption
that
insubstantial
bivens
suits
would
be
quickly
disposed
of
by
the
lower
courts
even
without
the
protection
of
absolute
immunity.
the
dissent
in
economou
stated
that
the
majority's
assurances
in
this
regard
reflected
optimism
rather
than
prescience.
in
view
if
the
federal
government,
based
on
experience,
defending
these
cases
over
the
last
three
or
four
years,
the
court's
assurances
in
economou
unfortunately
have
not
proven
correct.
this
case
is
a
prime
example.
the
only
allegation
in
the
plaintiff's
lengthy
complaint
or
affidavits
that
might
suggest
that
the
defendants
are
not
entitled
to
qualified
good
faith
immunity
from
damages
liability
is
the
boilerplate
assertion
at
the
very
end
of
the
complaint
that
the
defendants
acted
"wilfully
and
maliciously".
that
assertion
is
not
tied
into
any
specific
factual
allegations
in
the
complaint,
or
substantiated
in
any
other
way.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
was
not
a
trial,
but
there
were
summary
judgment
motions.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
would
be
the
case
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
on
summary
judgment
motions,
the
defendant
is
supposed
to
come
in
with
affidavits
and
the
plaintiff
is
supposed
to
counter
those
affidavits.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
was
one
of
the
issues
raised
in
butz
against
economou
as
an
example
of
why
absolute
immunity
was
needed
as
a
protection
against
lawsuits
designed
to
intimidate
or
harass.
in
ruling
against
the
government's
argument
that
there
should
be
absolute
immunity,
the
court
stated
that
"insubstantial
lawsuits
against
federal
officials
can
be
quickly
terminated
by
federal
courts
alert
to
the
possibilities
of
artful
pleading.
"
and
the
court
said,
and
again
i
quote,
"damages
suits
concerning
constitutional
violations
need
not
proceed
to
trial,
but
can
be
terminated
on
a
properly
supported
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
the
defense
of
immunity.
"
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
am
reading
from
the
court's
opinion,
and
my
point
is
that
that
was
a
basic
assumption.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
gather
as
much.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
was.
it
was
raised
in
both
lower
courts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
were...
voluminous
evidence
was
submitted
in
this
case
both
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
the
defendants,
although
the
district
court
did
not
dismiss
this
case
on
summary
judgment
grounds.
it
was
dismissed
for
failure
to...
it
was
dismissed,
the
injunctive
parts
were
dismissed
for
mootness--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
was
dismissed
on
immunity
grounds.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
decision
was
prior
to
butz
against
economou,
and
therefore
the
district
court
did
not...
it
merely
said
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
official
immunity
under
barr
versus
mateo
rather
than--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that...
i
think
even
under
the
good
faith
aspect
qualified
immunity
should
have
been
accorded
here,
but
certainly
if
the
only
inquiry
was
whether
the
law
was
clearly
established,
where
the
defendants
violated
some
clearly
established
rule
of
law,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
in
this
case
that
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
those
grounds
should
have
been
granted
since
i
don't
think
even
today
it
is
clear
that
what
the
defendants
did
here
violated
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights.
it
certainly
was
not
clear
in
1974.
the
government
has
argued,
by
the
way,
for
just
such
a
rule
of
only
an
objective
test
for
qualified
immunity
in
our
brief
last
year
in
the
kissinger
case.
we
are
not
suggesting
here
that
economou
should
be
overruled.
we
do
think,
though,
that
the
court
should
give
clear
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
that
the
liberal
rules
of
noticed
pleading
that
may
apply
generally
in
civil
litigation
do
not
apply
with
the
same
force
in
bivens
actions,
and
that
federal
officials
should
not
be
forced
to
undergo
discovery
or
a
trial
without
specific
allegations
of
wrongdoing.
allegations
in
this
case
do
not
even
come
close
to
meeting
the
appropriate
standard.
they
suggest
only
that
the
plaintiffs
had
a
disagreement
with
the
defendants
about
how
the
leaa
statute
ought
to
have
been
administered.
we
believe
that
these
sorts
of
disagreements,
if
they
are
properly
in
court
at
all,
should
be
litigated
in
injunctive
actions
such
as
those
authorized
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
not
in
personal
damages
actions
with
their
inevitable
tendency
to
harass
and
intimidate
public
officials
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
yet,
as
i
said
earlier,
this
case
was
filed
in
september,
1975,
and
six
years
later
these
defendants
are
still
trying
to
escape
from
under
this
lawsuit.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr
chief
justice.
virtually
all
of
the
arguments
that
mr.
larson
just
made
are
addressed
in
our
reply
brief,
to
which
i
would
refer
the
court,
but
there
are
a
few
things
i
do
want
to
stress
specifically.
one,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
of
course
there
is
apa
review
of
these
decisions,
and
plaintiffs
have
brought
an
apa
suit
which
is
pending.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
brought
it
in
the
district
court.
it
was
dismissed
as
being
moot.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
and
those
proceedings
have
been
held
in
abeyance
pending
this
court's
decision.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
jurisdiction
would
be
under
28
usc
1331.
second,
it
is
important
to
realize,
because
so
much
focus
has
been
on
the
1973
and
1976
amendments,
that
those
were
just
amendments
to
section
518(c)(2)
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
antidiscrimination
provision.
but
there
is
a
separate
section
which
has
been
in
the
statute
since
the
very
beginning,
section
509,
which
is
the
fund
termination
provision.
section
518(c)(2)
simply
says
if
the
administration
makes
a
number
of
findings,
then
it
should
look
to
section
509
for
fund
termination.
so,
it
is
section
509
that
arguably
is
in
the
plaintiff's
view
non
discretionary.
we
would
refer
the
court
to
the
house
report
on
section
509
which
is
quoted
at
page
22
of
our
brief,
which
says
that
under
section
509,
the
attorney
general
may
terminate
or
suspend
payments
on
a
finding
that
there
is
a
substantial
failure
to
comply,
and
that
he
has
broad
discretionary
power
over
the
fund
termination
process.
section
509
has
not
been
amended
at
any
time,
and
that
is
the
fund
termination
provision.
now,
third,
as
i
understand
mr.
larson,
he
has
changed
the
theory
of
the
plaintiff's
case
yet
again
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
earlier
questions,
because
as
i
understood
the
theory
of
plaintiff's
case
this
morning,
it
was
that
it
is
irrelevant
what
the
grantees
would
or
would
not
have
done
if
the
funding
had
been
terminated,
and
that
is
found
on
page
36
of
their
brief,
when
they
explain
why
cases
like
simon
versus
eastern
kentucky
are
irrelevant
here,
but
now
we
are
told
that
that
is
their
theory,
and
that
they
made
allegations
to
that
effect
in
their
complaint.
the
final
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
although
there
was
no
discovery
in
this
case
because
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
quickly
filed,
respondents
did
get
massive
discovery
from
leaa
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
while
this
case
was
pending,
and
they
submitted
voluminous
materials
in
response
to
the
defendant's
summary
judgment
motion.
thank
you.
