unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
are
you
also
going
to
address
the
simon
versus
eastern
kentucky
standing
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
standing
is
an
article
3
requirement
in
many
cases,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
a
jurisdictional
thing
which
both
counsel
and
the
court
are
obliged
to
notice--
unknown
speaker
--all
three
judges
below
felt
there
was
sufficient
standing
here
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are...
off
the
statement
in
your
brief
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
with
him
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
reason
doesn't
state
a
cause
of
action,
there
are
no
allegations
of
injury
flowing
from
allegedly
unconstitutional
action,
it
is
a
standing
question,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
can
be,
and
may
just
as
well,
don't
you
have
to
state
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
a
jurisdictional
question?
could
it
be
a
case
or
controversy
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
hence
no
standing?
unknown
speaker
no
injury
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
cause
of
action
that
was
attempted
to
be
stated,
a
constitutional
tort
or
complaint?
unknown
speaker
has
the
government
ever
suggested
that
there
isn't
a
private
cause
of
action
in
the
context
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
that
is
prior?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action,
you
never
get
to
the
merits.
you
are
talking
about
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
in
the...
there
you
don't
have
the
administrative
detail,
the
administrative
enforcement
scheme.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
was
a
valid
argument.
you
certainly
would
never
reach
the
question
of
a
constitutional
violation.
you
would
just
say
we
don't
have
to
adjudicate
that.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
would
like
it
answered,
but--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
like
saying,
before
you
decide
whether
you
can
sue
in
this
court,
we
will
decide
the
merits
of
your
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
that
issue
about
implied
cause
of
action,
i
would
take
it...
i
would
classify
as
a
non
constitutional
question,
and
you
are
just
telling
us
that
we
have
to
reach
a
constitutional
issue,
although
there
very
well
may
be
a
non
constitutional
way
of
disposing
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
you
can
make
us
reach
a
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
court
held
there
is
no
case
or
controversy?
isn't
that
the
end
of
everything?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
reach
bivens,
you
don't
reach
any
other
questions.
unknown
speaker
and
you
wouldn't
reach
bivens
if
you
said
there
wasn't
a
private
cause
of
action
at
all.
you
wouldn't
reach
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
i
am
not
sure,
based
on
what
has
been
said,
that
the
court
will
find
that
we
reach
the
merits,
but
assuming
that
the
court
were
to
do
so,
do
you
think
that
the
complaint
that
was
filed,
the
amended
complaint
can
be
read
to
incorporate
allegations
of
action
by
at
least
some
of
the
defendants
that
are
not
discretionary
type
actions,
which
poses
additional
problems,
of
course,
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
how
about
all
those
statements
on
page
20,
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
like
a
policy
of
not
conducting
any
pre
award
compliance--
unknown
speaker
--it
also
said
willful
and
malicious.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
quote.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
they
allege.
unknown
speaker
if
in
fact
the
case
were
to
go
off
on
standing,
and
the
court
were
to
decide
that
even
assuming
that
everything
was
true
in
plaintiff's
complaint
there
was
nothing
but
the
most
speculative
sort
of
benefit
that
would
result
to
them
from
any
judicial
relief
that
could
be
granted,
wouldn't
that
also
avoid
going
through
the
prolix
allegations
of
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
on
summary
judgment
motions
all
the
well
pleaded
allegations
are
treated
favorably
to
the
plaintiffs,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
qualified
immunity
always
involves
state
of
mind,
and
that
is
something
that
a
defendant
can't
negate.
unknown
speaker
by
repealing
the
federal
rules.
unknown
speaker
he
agrees
with
your
reading.
unknown
speaker
is
this
qualified
immunity
raised?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
goes
back,
couldn't
it
be
raised
again?
it
never
was
tried
out,
was
it?
because
you
can't
try
out
qualified
immunity
without
some
evidence,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
did
it
rule
on
qualified
immunity?
no,
it
didn't.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
rule
on
the
qualified
immunity
point?
unknown
speaker
did
not.
i
thought
so.
suppose,
mr.
geller,
that
qualified
immunity
had
only
one
inquiry,
an
objective
inquiry,
and
had
no
good
faith
aspect
to
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson--
unknown
speaker
--just
affidavits?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
a
necessary
element
of
your
case
to
be
pleaded
and
proved
be
that
the
plaintiffs'
grievances
be
redressed
if
the
action
you
sought
to
have
taken
by
the
court
were
taken,
that
is,
that
if
funding
were
cut
off,
the
police
departments
which
you
claim
were
discriminating
would
change
their
discriminatory
policies?
unknown
speaker
did
you
plead
it
in
your
complaint?
unknown
speaker
with
regard
to
the
substantial
probability
that
the
departments
would
change
their
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
fine
as
to
new
orleans,
but
you
are
asking
for
relief
against
a
great
number
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
you
can't
say
that
they
won't,
but
the
fact
that
one
police
department
has
responded
to
the
fund
cutoff
certainly
doesn't
prove
that
every
police
department
that
would
be
involved
in
this
case
would
react
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
if
you
pleaded
it,
certainly.
unknown
speaker
even
if
leaa
was
supplying
only
one
half
percent
of
their
budget?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
certainly
it
isn't
the
same
in
every
case,
is
it?
i
mean,
it
isn't
a
uniform
policy
of
funding
20
percent
of
the
police
departments
across
the
country.
it
is
specific
grants.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
rights
of
your
clients
are
you
claiming?
unknown
speaker
not
to
be
discriminated
against
by
the
leaa
officials?
unknown
speaker
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
a
constitutional
bivens
sort
of
thing
you
are
asserting?
unknown
speaker
are
you
also
claiming
that
you
have
a
right
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
claim
that
you
had
no...
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
shouldn't
be
an
implied
constitutional
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
yes,
before
judgment
there?
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn't
adverted
to
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
they
don't,
but
didn't
the
congress
at
one
point
make
more
detailed
provisions
for
administrative
review
and
cutoff?
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
dissatisfied
with
what
had
been
happening?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
provided
a
more...
they
put
more
obligations,
more
details,
procedures?
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
this
hypothetical
on
you.
suppose
allegations
of
the
complaint
stated
that
the
secretary
of
defense
and
all
his
subordinates
in
dealing
with
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
government
contracts
were
sending
98
percent
of
them
in
the
sun
belt
region
below
the
frost
line,
or
however
that
is
identified
these
days.
would
you
have
an
equal
protection
claim
based
on
denial
of
equal
protection
in
terms
of
damages
against
the
secretary
of
defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
matter
how
good
it
is,
is
it
good
enough
to
sustain...
to
survive
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
difference
that
you
see
here?
it
isn't
racial.
i
deliberately
posed
it
as
not
racial
and
not
based
on
gender.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
denial
of
equal
protection,
isn't
it,
if
they
are
sending
it
all
south?
or
sending
it
all
north,
all
the
contracts?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not
claiming
that
the
government
officials
invidiously
discriminated,
are
you?
you
are
claiming
that
they
refused
to
set
in
motion
fund
cutoff
procedures
against
local
officials
who
were
invidiously
discriminatory.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
was
interested...
i
am
interested
in
the
legislative
history.
am
i
correct,
you
did
not
cite
the
conference
report
in
your
brief?
i
think
i
am
correct
in
that,
and
i
am
curious
as
to
why
you
didn't.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
earlier.
i
found
the
conference
report
rather
remunerative
to
look
at,
but
it
is
not
cited
in
your
brief,
and
i
wondered
if
there
was
a
reason
for
it.
unknown
speaker
this
would
apply
to
some
men
who
have
been
out
of
government
for
quite
a
while.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
still
liable
to
the
$100
million?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
care.
you
think
this
is
just
tough
on
them?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wanted
your
position.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
in
one
phrase
at
one
place
in
the
complaint.
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
once.
unknown
speaker
well,
twice.
i
stand
corrected.
twice.
unknown
speaker
don't
lecture
me
on
the
rules
of
pleading,
please.
i
took
those
before
you
were
born.
unknown
speaker
the
leaa
determines
there
has
been
a
non
compliance,
and
you
say
thereupon
there
was
triggered
the
duty
to
institute
proceedings
to
terminate?
unknown
speaker
and
you
asked
them
to
do
that,
and
they
say
no,
or
they
don't
act,
period.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
am
just
wondering,
is
there
judicial
review
of
this
action?
unknown
speaker
i
know
there
is
no
particular
provision
for
it,
but
wouldn't
there
be
judicial
review
of
it
in
the
district
court
on
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard?
unknown
speaker
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
into
court
in
such
a
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
give
jurisdiction,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
