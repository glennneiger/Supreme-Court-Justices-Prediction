mr.
martin
guggenheim
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
there
is
federal
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
to
challenge
a
termination
of
parental
rights
order
where
the
challenge
is
based
upon
the
claim
that
the
state
court
lacked
constitutional
power
to
order
the
children
into
state
custody
because
the
statute
under
which
it
purported
to
act
is
federally
unconstitutional.
a
related
question
is
whether
the
petitioner,
as
the
mother
who
gave
birth
to
the
children
who
are
now
wards
of
the
state
and
nurtured
them
through
their
formative
years,
has
standing
to
challenge
on
their
behalf
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
order
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes,
related
to
the
first
question
of
whether
there
is
federal
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
whether
the
petitioner
as
the
mother
before
the
final
order
of
the
pennsylvania
courts
has
standing
in
the
federal
habeas
action
to
bring
this
case
on
the
children's
behalf.
this
case
does
not
present
any
question
respecting
the
scope
of
federal
review
in
such
a
habeas
corpus
action
or
concerning
the
relitigation
of
facts
or
the
best
interests
of
the
children.
the
court
below,
the
en
banc
third
circuit,
ruled
in
a
split
decision,
two
plurality
decisions
of
that
court,
against
petitioner;
four
interlocking,
interweaving,
but
we
would
submit
mistaken
bases
for
the
conclusion
that
jurisdiction
does
not
lie
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
mother
does
not
have
legal
capacity
to
bring
the
action
on
behalf
of
their
children.
the
second
is
that
the
children
are
not
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
other
two
grounds
are
policy
grounds:
the
fear
that
according
such
jurisdiction
would
necessarily
lead
to
including
intra-family
disputes,
such
as
child
custody
disputes
in
the
ordinary
separation
of
a
family
divorce
context;
and
the
fourth,
general
federalism
concerns
and
implications
respecting
the
appropriate
role
of
a
federal
court
in
determining
constitutional
norms
in
this
area.
we
submit
that
there
clearly
is
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
that
that
jurisdiction
derives
from
the
literal
language
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
sections
2241
and
section
2254
of
title
28.
the
first
issue
for
the
court
is
whether
the
children
are
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
resolved
that
question
numerous
times
in
the
past.
historically,
of
course,
it
was
the
act
of
1867
which
broadly
expanded
the
scope
of
federal
habeas
jurisdiction
to
all
persons
in
custody
of
the
state
in
violation
of
the
laws,
treaties
or
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
1886
this
court
in
wales
against
whitney
recognized
that
the
term
habeas,
that
the
term
custody,
is
a
term
that
applies
to
a
great
variety
of
restraints
for
which
it
is
used
to
get
relief.
confinement
under
civil
and
criminal
process
may
be
so
relieved.
indeed,
wives
restrained
by
husbands,
children
withheld
from
their
proper
parent
or
guardian,
persons
held
under
arbitrary
custody
by
private
individuals,
may
all
become
proper
subjects
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
of
course
the
question
respecting
the
definition
and
breadth
of
custody
does
not
address
solely
or
conclude
finally
whether
or
not
federal
habeas
corpus
lies.
but
it
clearly
shows
that
the
term
"custody"
in
the
statute
is
easily
met
by
children
in
this
case
who
are
wards
of
the
state.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
am
reading
from
the
court's
opinion
in
wales
against
whitney--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--at
114
u.s.--
that
exact
language
is
not
in
the
brief,
but
the
quote,
the
cite
to
wales
against
whitney
is
in
the
brief.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
both.
they
were
in
the
physical
custody
of
foster
parents.
they
were
in
the
legal
custody
of
the
state.
they
were
temporary
wards
of
the
state
prior
to
the
final
order
of
the
probate
court
which
made
them
permanent
wards
of
the
state,
at
least
until
they
might
be
adopted
in
the
future.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
in
the
brief
we
make
the
point
that
there
may
well
be
equitable
reasons
to
limit
habeas.
i
think...
it's
a
complicated
answer.
i
think
that
jurisdiction
does
exist
to
make
the
challenge,
but
i
think
that
a
court
may
determine
that
the
children
are
no
longer
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no,
no,
not
on
the
merits.
even
on
the
jurisdiction,
after
it
made
an
inquiry
into
where
the
children
were
at
that
moment.
and
the
reason
is,
wales
against
whitney,
of
course,
as
broad
as
the
language
is
that
i've
just
cited
back
in
1886
was,
if
not
reversed
by
this
court
in
jones
against
cunningham,
clearly
broadly
expanded
in
jones
against
cunningham,
and
that
the
test
in
the
twentieth
century
has
been
that
a
person
must
be
subject
to
restraints
not
shared
by
the
public
generally.
there
can
be
no
question
that
children
who
are
state
wards,
children
who
are
parentless,
children
who
don't
have
relatives,
children
who
are
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
state
to
be
moved
about
within
the
state's
care,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
smith
against
offer
case,
are
persons
who
are
restrained
of
their
liberty
in
a
manner
which
is
not
shared
by
the
public
generally.
however,
justice
rehnquist,
it
may
be...
and
this
case
does
not
raise
that
question...
that
once
the
children
have
been
adopted
they
no
longer
meet
the
test
of
jones
against
cunningham,
because
they
are
no
longer
subject
to
these
peculiar
restraints.
it
may
also
be
that
they
do
still
meet
the
test,
and
i
would
commend
to
this
court
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
in
syrovatka
against
erlich,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
in
which
that
court
ruled
that
children
who
had
been
adopted
already
were
not
within
custody--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--yes,
they
are.
there's
no
question
that
they
are.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
the
restraint
that
is
peculiar
here
is
not
merely
that
they're
in
a
foster
home.
unfortunately,
in
this
society
today
that's
not
as
peculiar
as
it
once
was.
but
it
is
combined
with
the
fact
that
they
are
permanent
wards
of
the
state.
they
don't
have
parents.
they
aren't
related
to
parents.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
it
is
the
quality
of
the
restraint
that
one
must
look
to.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
they
are
prohibited
from
visiting--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--no.
but
that's
not
the
only
question
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
"restraint".
as
justice
blackmunn
for
this
court
only
last
week
in
the
santosky
case
recognized,
children
who
never
get
to
know
their
parents
are
subject
to
a
peculiar,
if
not
restraint,
at
least
deprivation.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
he
did
not
say
restraint.
that
wasn't
the
issue
in
that
case.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
the
restraint
here
is
the
prohibition
from
being
visited
by
one's
parents,
from
being
connected
by
roots
with
one's
home.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
the
question
then
is--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
there
is
an
alternative
reliance,
which
is
the
technical
word.
the
clear
word
in
the
statute
is
"custody".
the
one
year
old
who
is
in
custody
of
the
state
in
violation
of
the
constitution
meets
the
test.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
think
not.
i
think
not,
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
answered
that
question
several
times.
in
in
re
burrus
and
in
matters
against
ryan--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
the
actual...
but
that
language
follows
from
the
very
language
which
i
read.
the
court
has
recognized
that
there
is
no
satisfactory
definition--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--unfortunately,
i'm
reading
from
the
lawyer's
edition
volume,
and
it's
279
of
that
volume.
but--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--that's
right,
and
the
court
found
he
was
not
confined.
this
court
has
really
overruled
wales
in
jones
against
cunningham.
but
my
point
is
that
where
it
found
the
naval
officer
was
not
confined,
it
found
that
wives
and
children
were
confined.
the
very
language
used
by
representative
lawrence--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--no,
it
did
not.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i'm
not
relying
on
the
wales
case
to
indicate
that
that
naval
officer
was...
had
his
rights
violated
or
vindicated,
but
only
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
jones
against
cunningham
again,
that
at
the
common
law
both
in
english
and
american
usage
the
term
"custody"...
and
i
must
emphasize
that
that's
not
dispositive
of
this
case,
but
only
that
the
term
"custody"
has
always
included
children
being
held
wrongfully
by
third
parties.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
not
ordinary
court
custody
decrees,
because...
but
yes,
i
do
think
congress
gave
the
federal
courts
authority
to
review
this
case.
as
this
court
recognized
in
ex
parte
mcardle
and
again
in
cases
within
the
last
two
decades,
the
breadth
of
federal
habeas
corpus
was
expanded
by
the
1867
act
as
far
as
constitutionally
permissible
to
include...
and
what's
the
test...
all
persons
held
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
laws
and
treaties
of
the
united
states.
what...
and
this
now
answers
both
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
and
chief
justice
burger's
question.
ordinary
court
custody
decrees
in
the
ordinary
intra-family
dispute
are
not
cognizable
under
this
statute,
not
because
the
children
are
not
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
law,
but
because
the
children
are
not
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
in
re
burrus
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
matters
against
ryan.
in
both
cases,
the
court
recognized
plainly
that
the
custody
requirement
was
met.
that's
not
what
was
lacking.
but
there
is
within
the
jones
against
cunningham
test
yet
another
reason
to
conclude
that
children
who
are
subject
to
one
parent
rather
than
another's
custody
is
not
in
custody...
are
not
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
because
of
the
jones
test,
that
they
are
not
subject
to
restraints
not
shared
by
the
public
generally.
children
must
live
with
one
or
another
of
their
parents.
if
one
parent
to
the
dispute
died,
the
other
parent
would
get
custody
automatically,
and
certainly
the
children
would
be
hard-pressed
to
claim
that
the
custody
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
this
is
entirely
different
from
court
wards,
as
these
children
are,
entirely
different.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
the
kind
of
due
process
of
law
that
may
raise
the
question
might
be
the
culco
type
case,
where
the
court
actually
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
i
can
see
that
that--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
no
fair
hearing...
we
have
the
court's
analysis
in
the
flagg
brothers
case,
where
the
court
recognized
that
private
parties
acting
pursuant
to
a
statute...
every
state
has
a
statute
that
says--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--several
federal
courts
have
allowed
that
jurisdiction,
have
found
jurisdiction
exists
in
such
a
case,
but
summarily
find
that
the
claim
is
frivolous.
in
almost
every
case--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--the
court
could
interpret
the
jones
against
cunningham
test
of
restraints
not
shared
by
the
public
generally
to
find
that
even
where...
and
the
difference
is
that
we're
not
focusing
on
the
in
violation
of
the
constitution
clause.
let's
go
back
to
the
custody.
maybe
they're
not
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute,
because
the
court
in
jones
defined
that
test
in
a
way
that
fits
very
nicely
with
this
case.
if
a
colorable
claim
were
made
that
they
are
something
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
i
suppose
that's
for
a
federal
court
to
determine.
but
there
are
very
few
types--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--yes.
the
same
question
has
already
been
posed,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
a
hedged
answer:
maybe,
maybe
not.
the
eight
circuit
in
syrovatka
said,
we're
going
to
find
that
the
parents
waited
too
long
to
bring
the
case,
the
children
are
no
longer...
the
case
cannot
be
brought.
i
think
that
the
answer
may
be,
because
the
custody
is
of
a
very
different
type,
the
answer
may
well
be
no.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
we
don't
know,
except
that
allen
against
mccurry--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
if
the
parents
are
seeking
the
return
of
their
children--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--prizer
might
require...
prizer
against
rodriguez
might
require--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
but
if
fact
or
duration
of
custody
was
being
challenged,
is
the
test.
we
don't
know
if
it
only
involved
prisoners.
we
certainly
know
it
did
involve
prisoners.
there
is
a
prizer
box
here
that
may
require
1983
not
to
be
used,
that
may
require
habeas
to
be
used.
but
if
we
get
beyond
that,
if
the
parents
sued
for
damages
only,
habeas
corpus
is
the
inappropriate
remedy.
habeas
is
our
ideal
remedy,
congressionally
imposed
on
the
federal
courts
to
change
custody.
but
allen
against
mccurry
is
involved,
too,
because
this
court
has
ruled
that
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
are
applicable
in
section
1983
cases.
in
a
case
like
the
one
before
the
court
today,
the
issues
were
fully
exhausted
in
the
state
court.
indeed,
we're
proud
of
that.
within
the
framework
of
the
federal
habeas
law,
that's
what
we're
supposed
to
do.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
might
turn
the
question
around
and
ask,
how
could
we
seriously
claim
that
a
person
who
is
merely
on
parole,
that
periodically
has
to
make
a
visit
with
a
parole
officer...
or
if
we
move
on
to
carafas
against
lavallee
or
the
other
cases
where
this
court
has
broadly
expanded
the
term
"custody"...
in
strait
against
laird,
the
reservist
who
has
to
report
for
some
future
armed
services
duty.
in
carafas
the
court
found
that
the
disabilities
of
engaging
in
a
type
of
business,
of
voting,
of
serving
as
a
labor
official
or
a
juror
was
a
sufficient
restraint.
the
answer
is,
how
are
the
children
restrained
of
their
liberty:
the
state
and
not
the
parent
is
empowered
to
consent
to
their
marriage
by
the
statute.
23
consolidated
pennsylvania
laws,
section
2521,
provides
that
the
parent...
that
the
state
and
not
the
parent
shall
consent
to
the
enlistment
in
the
armed
forces,
that
the
state
and
not
the
parent
shall
consent
to
the
major
medical,
psychiatric
and
surgical
treatment,
and
that
the
state
and
not
the
parent
shall
exercise
such
other
authority
concerning
the
child
as
a
natural
parent
should
exercise.
in
short,
as
justice
marshall
indicated,
it
is
the
totality
of
restraint,
of
conditions
on
the
child
imposed
by
the
state,
which
makes
that
person's
liberty
different
from
that
which
the
public
shares
generally,
even
other
children.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes,
that's
a
difference.
but
children
may
not
waive
constitutional
rights.
we
know
that
from
in
re
gault.
we
know
that
from
a
host
of
cases.
parham
against
j.r.
is
certainly
an
excellent
example.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
the
point,
justice
marshall,
is
that
we
don't
give
children...
in
a
case
like
gilmore
against
utah,
we
allowed
the
mother
to
come
to
this
court
and
say--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--this
has
been
described
as
the
death
penalty
of
parents.
as
this
court
recognized
last
week
in
santosky,
there
are
few
more
irreversible
or
formidable
actions
the
state
can
take
than
the
permanent
destruction--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
gilmore
the
reason
the
mother
could
not
come
forward
is
because,
as
a
knowing
and
intelligent
adult,
mr.
gilmore
waived
his
constitutional
rights.
i
suggest
it
would
be
standing
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
its
head--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--i
am
only
making
the
analogy
to
the
limited
extent
that
this
court
has
never
recognized
in
its
jurisprudence
the
principle
that
children
who
are
under
the
age
of...
at
least
not
yet
mature
minors,
in
the
baird
and
bellotti,
and
planned
parenthood
and
danforth
context...
have
the
discretion
to
waive
constitutional
rights
on
their
own.
it
is
the
presumption
of
the
parent
and
child
identity
of
interest
that
this
case
goes
to.
if
the
mother's
rights
were
permanently
severed
unconstitutionally,
she
is
the
one
to
speak
for
them
because
of
this
court's
presumption
of
identity
of
interests.
to
presume
that
that
presumption
does
not
continue
to
exist--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--not
after
allen
against
mccurry.
and
probably...
that's
the
interesting
thing,
that
this
court
in
moore
against
sims
said,
don't
come
into
court
beforehand.
in
allen
against
mccurry
it
said,
you
can't
come
in
afterwards,
because
of
collateral
estoppel
effect.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
we
did,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
congress
wants.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
we
did.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
with
three
justices
dissenting,
and
if
justice--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--we
didn't
appeal
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
is,
we
don't
have
to.
we
know
that.
brown
against
allen
and
many
cases
have
indicated
that
you
never
have
to
exercise
the
appeal,
even
though
it
exists.
the
second
is
that
the
risk
that
this
court
would,
in
the
parlance
of
this
court,
dwfsq
without
full
consideration
of
the
case
was
a
risk
that
was
concerning.
but
beyond
that,
there
was
the
concern
for
an
as-applied
and
a
facial
attack
of
the
statute
that,
frankly
confused
me
as
the
attorney
in
whether
a
full
appeal
existed
or
whether
it
should
be
a
hybrid
appeal
and
cert
petition.
and
so
the
conservative
route
taken
was
to
file
the
certiorari
petition.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
we
lost,
but
never
made
clear
to
us
that
that
was
the
final
resolution
of
the
matter,
and
unclear
to
me
that
it
was
clear
to
any
justice
of
this
court,
when
only
three
justices
voted
to
hear
the
case.
indeed,
justice
white
only
the
next...
later
that
same
term,
in
a
case
cited
in
the
brief,
brown
transportation
corp.
against
atcon,
cited
this
very
case
as
an
example
of
this
court's
overburdened
docket,
something
that
justice--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--along
with
a
lot
of
other
cases.
but
it
goes
to
this
policy
question.
and
the
answer
to
justice
blackmun's
suggestion
that
we
took
our
chance
and
lost
is,
does
this
court
want
to
make
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
the
only
avenue
of
federal
review
ever
will
be
an
appeal
to
this
court?
justice
white
in
this
very
case--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--well,
when
you
say
we
took
our
chances
and
lost--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--we
took
our
chances
and
didn't
get
review
then,
and
now
we're
still
struggling.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no,
we
don't.
but
we
know
that
frank
is
now
18
and
unless
a
federal
court
reinstates
his
parental
rights
he's
going
to
be,
if
we
know
of
a
tale
of
two
cities,
a
stateless
person.
he
is
an
orphan
made
only
by
the
state
for
no
good
purpose.
we
don't
know.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
he's
probably
an
adult
now.
but
certainly
under
the
collateral
consequences
doctrine,
he
still
has
a
colorable
action
in
this
court,
in
a
federal
court.
we
don't
know
their
views,
but
that
is,
i
think
to
answer
your
suggestion,
irrelevant
to
the
limited
point
that
that's
the
merits.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
16
and
12.
and
the
oldest
boy
was
in
four
different
foster
homes,
another
was
in
three,
and
one
was
in
only
one.
this
court
in
a
variety
of
types
of
cases
has
recognized
that
habeas
jurisdiction
exists
in
other
than
the
criminal
context,
in
other
than
the
prisoner
context.
this
is
clearly
one
where
the
court
should
accept
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
for
the
court
in
policy
grounds
to
consider
whether
or
not
to
hear
a
case.
as
justice
brennan
in
the
fair
assessment
in
real
estate
association
recognized,
this
court
through
policy
and
comity
grounds
may
delay,
but
never
deny,
permanent
review.
and
in
the
moore
against
sims
and
allen
against
mccurry
problem,
this
is
the
last
possibility
for
federal
review
at
any
level
other
than
appeal
in
this
court.
and
we
submit
that
there
are
sound
reasons
for
allowing
it
in
this
way.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
could
he
consent
to
the
adoption
by
his
mother?
mr.
martin
guggenheim
thank
you.
this
case
is
the
paradigm
of
state
action.
it's
state-initiated
proceedings
which
result
in
ongoing
state
custody.
it
may
be
that
the
prudential
concern
of
this
court
is
in
defining
custody
so
it
does
not
include
people
already
adopted.
but
there
are
strong
policy
reasons
for
a
boy
like
frank,
whose
rights
were
terminated
for
no
reason,
who
never
was
going
to
be
adopted
and
never
has
been
adopted,
to
have
the
opportunity
for
federal
review
at
some
level.
this
court,
however,
has
never
countenanced--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--had
what?
mr.
martin
guggenheim
he
had
the
opportunity
for
it
and
it
was
only
a
cert
petition.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
basically,
and
for
the
complication
that
there
was
an
as-applied
and
a
facial
attack
in
the
case,
and
only
one
of
them
would
be
cognizable
on
direct
appeal.
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute.
it
is,
in
justice
powell's
words
in
stone
against
powell,
going
to
the
heart
of
guilt
or
innocence.
it's
not
an
extra
question.
in
justice
stevens'
words
in
rose
against
lundy,
this
is
his
fourth
kind
of
habeas
claim.
it
goes
to
the
validity
of
the
judgment.
this
court
has
never
countenanced
the
denial
of
congressionally
imposed
jurisdiction
for
policy
or
prudential
reasons.
stone
is
the
limit
of
this
court
interpreting
what
the
meaning
of
"in
violation
of
the
constitution"
was,
to
say
that
the
illegal
search
didn't
meet
that
test.
but
it
has
never
gone
beyond
that.
and
finally,
this
court...
the
court
below,
the
majority
of
the
third
circuit
judges
believed
that
federal
review
was
appropriate
and
was
necessary,
but
peculiarly,
thought
it
was
better
to
reserve
the
federal
issues,
contrary
to
congress'
desire
of
exhaustion
in
the
england
type
context,
to
reserve;
in
the
first
place,
litigate
through
the
state
court,
then
go
into
federal
court
in
1983
and
say
the
statute's
unconstitutional.
i
submit
that
is
not
respecting
basic
principles
of
comity.
that
is
showing
a
greater
disregard
for
the
intelligence
and
concern
of
state
judges
than
to
require,
as
the
habeas
statute
does,
full
exhaustion
of
the
remedies
in
the
first
place.
and
finally,
although
i
won't
refer
to
a
dissent
to
rely
on
it
solely,
all
of
the
justices
of
this
court
in
the
santosky
case
recognized
that
federal
courts
should
not
and
may
not
blink
at
unconstitutional
statutes.
we
submit
that
this
is
one
and
that
this
court
should
remand
to
the
federal
court
for
a
full
hearing.
thank
you.
