unknown
speaker
the
question
is
a
little
narrower,
i
thought:
whether
she
can
do
it
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
federal
court.
is
it
not
that
narrow?
unknown
speaker
what
were
you
just
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
mr.
guggenheim,
what
was
the
exact
position
of
the
children
at
the
time
the
habeas
corpus
action
was
brought?
were
they
in
the
physical
custody
of
the
state
or
were
they
in
a
foster
home?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
habeas
corpus
extended
to
the
recovery
of
custody
of
children
who
were
already
adopted?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
mr.
guggenheim,
aren't
all
children
subject
to
restraint?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
draw
the
line
here?
i
mean,
why
is
it
more
restraint
to
be
in
a
foster
home
than
to
be
in
your
own
home,
on
the
word
"restraint"?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
working
on
the
word
"restraint".
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
difference
in
the
quality?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
start
with
a
one
year
old
child.
what
is
the
difference
in
the
restraint
in
a
foster
home
from
the
restraint
of
a
one
year
old
child
in
his
own
parents'
home?
i
mean,
he's
not
free
to
go
any
place,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
he
said
restraint.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
don't
even
know
your
parents?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
worried
about...
i'm
worried
about
you
relying
on
the
word
"restraint".
unknown
speaker
well,
on
your
theory
if
a
husband
and
a
wife,
divorced
or
separated,
get
into
an
argument
over
the
children,
you
could
have...
one
could
bring
a
habeas
case
in
federal
court
against
the
other.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
court
answer
it
in
wales
against
whitney?
since
you
didn't
discuss
it
in
your
briefs,
i
hadn't
looked
at
it
until
now.
what
i
see
there
from
a
quick
look
is
that
in
order
to
make
a
case
for
habeas
in
the
federal
court,
you've
got
to
show
an
actual
confinement
of
some
kind.
now,
where
is
the
actual
confinement
here?
unknown
speaker
what
page
of
the
opinion
was
that,
if
you
have
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
case
was
a
wholly
different
case,
in
any
event.
it
was
a
naval
officer--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
this
came
out
of
the
district
of
columbia,
didn't
it,
wales?
i
mean,
it
didn't
rely
on
the
habeas
statute
of
1867.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
totally
different
analysis.
the
district
of
columbia
had
full
municipal
jurisdiction
and
this
court
simply
sat
to
review
its
decision.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
congress
in
1967
intended
to
give
the
federal
courts
authority
to
review
court
custody
degrees?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
there
were
an
allegation
that
the
custody
decree
were
entered
without
due
process
of
law?
unknown
speaker
or
no
fair
hearing?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
a
judicial
proceeding
which
ends
up
with
awarding
a
child
to
one
parent
or
the
other,
and
the
one
who
didn't
get
the
child
says
that
the
proceeding
was
conducted
in
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is,
does
the
theory
of
your
case
encompass
that
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
take...
suppose
in
this
very
case
this
had
proceeded
all
the
way
to
an
adoption,
but
determination
of
rights,
in
violation
of
what
we
held
last
week
in
santosky,
was
based
on
a
preponderance
rather
than
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
test.
would
habeas
lie
in
that
case,
if
the
adoption
now
has
been
completed?
it's
gone...
here
i
gather
it's
pending
adoption,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the...
would
a
1983
suit
lie
in
that
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
civil
suit
for
violation...
it's
a
civil
suit
for
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
if
the
termination
was
on
the
basis
of
preponderance,
rather
than
clear
and
convincing.
unknown
speaker
suppose
they're
not.
they
want
damages.
unknown
speaker
that
involved
prisoners.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
conditional
custody
of
these
children
that
brings
it
within
the
jones
against
cunningham,
where
you
had
a
prisoner
who
was
paroled
from
prison?
what's
the
relevance
of
that
case
to
your
case?
unknown
speaker
there's
one
other
difference,
that
in
all
of
the
cases
you
mentioned,
including
jones,
the
party
involved
wanted
the
change.
unknown
speaker
you
can
go
in
any
book
and
pull
out
little
statements
like
that.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
the
death
penalty
and
child
custody.
unknown
speaker
well,
murder
is
one.
unknown
speaker
i
hope
you
do.
unknown
speaker
you
compare
that
case
with
this,
and
then
we'll
start
comparing
rocks
with
peanuts.
unknown
speaker
then
she
can
sue
under
1983,
can't
she?
unknown
speaker
maybe
we
wanted
you
to
litigate
in
the
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
didn't
petition
for
certiorari
here.
unknown
speaker
was
it
denied?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
appeal?
unknown
speaker
you
took
your
risk
on
the
certiorari
and
lost.
unknown
speaker
well,
along
with
a
lot
of
other
cases.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
didn't
imply
that
by
any
means.
unknown
speaker
well,
sure.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
lot
easier,
i
would
think,
to
get
a
note
of
probable
jurisdiction
here
than
to
get
a
grant
of
certiorari.
well,
let
me
ask
a
practical
question.
this
probably
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
case,
but
your
client
surrendered
these
three
boys
eleven
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
and
do
we
know
what
they
would
want
to
do
at
this
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
pennsylvania
law
is
he
an
adult?
unknown
speaker
under
state
law
would
your
client
have
the
right
to
custody
of
him
after
age
18?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
two
are
how
old?
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
understand
your
law,
you
don't
really
require
a
finding
of
unworthiness,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
so
how
does
this
line
of
cases--
unknown
speaker
--well,
may
i
ask,
does
that
mean,
mr.
greevy,
that...
here,
of
course,
it's
a
permanent
termination.
therefore
you
say
that
the
parent
can't
assert
any
rights
for
the
children.
would
that
be
true
if
it
were
only
a
temporary
custody,
she
were
deprived
temporarily
of
custody?
would
she
have
standing
then?
unknown
speaker
she
would?
unknown
speaker
so
you
make
the
distinction...
you
make
the
distinction,
based
on
the
fact
that
here
there
was
a
permanent
termination
of
parental
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
greevy,
i
gather
that
your
brother
is
arguing
that
if
we
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
standing
and
say
that
she
has
none,
then
we've
assumed
the
validity
of
the
very
state
court
adjudication
that
they're
challenging.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
answer
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
general
greevy,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
if
you're
correct
that
the
child
is...
that
there's
no
custody
here
and
therefore
the
habeas
corpus
statute
does
not
apply,
what
will
your
view
be
as
to
the
availability
of
a
1983
action?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
take
the
position
there's
no
such
remedy.
at
least
your
view
is
1983
is
definitely
available?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
not
time-barred.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
not
time-barred.
unknown
speaker
what
makes
you
think...
if
it
had
been
appealed
in
the
state
system
and
the
judgment
affirmed,
why
wouldn't
it
be
res
judicata
in
a
1983
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
be
available,
then.
1983
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
did
you
mean
it
was
a
choice
of
remedies
at
the
outset?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
they
made
their
choice
and
that
foreclosed
1983.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
choose
the
remedy
in
the
sense
of
initiating
the
original
proceeding.
you
chose
to
bring--
unknown
speaker
--and
are
you
suggesting
that
they
could
have...
could
they
or
could
they
not,
in
your
view,
have
filed
a
1983
case
before
they
appealed?
could
they
have
proceeded
simultaneously
with
the
two?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
only
way
they
could
rely
on
1983,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
is
to
limit
all
factual
defenses
and
merely
put
their
entire
case
on
the
claim
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they're
not
willing
to
take
that
chance,
then
they
really
had
no
federal
remedy,
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
right,
yes.
so
really,
then,
the
answer
is
in
your
view
1983
wouldn't
really
be
an
adequate
remedy.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
certainly
in
a
number
of
cases,
such
as
huffman
against
pursue
and
younger
against
harris,
we've
held
that
it's
a
perfectly
adequate
federal
remedy
to
have
the
right,
ultimate
right
of
review
here
from
a
state
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
apt
to
get
very
far
if
you
rely
on
dissenting
opinions.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
whose
dissent.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
then
you
want
santosky
overruled?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greevy,
i
suppose
you
can
lose
on
the
custody
argument
and
still
win
this
case,
couldn't
you?
that
is,
if
the
court
were
to
assume
there
was
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
you
could
still
win
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
matter
of--
unknown
speaker
--prudential
reasons.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greevy,
justice
blackmun's
question
prompts
me
to
ask
you
this.
i
guess
you
have
another
defense,
even
though
you
lost
here,
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
is
in
fact
constitutional.
so
if
we
ruled
against
you
and
sent
the
case
back,
suppose
it's
going
to
start
it's
way
back
up
on
the
basic
constitutional
issue.
so
that
i
guess
maybe
the
children
will
all
be
in
their
thirties
by
the
time--
unknown
speaker
he
had
it,
did
he
not,
in
'78?
unknown
speaker
direct
appeal
here.
unknown
speaker
for
strategic
reasons,
you
decided
to
forego
that.
