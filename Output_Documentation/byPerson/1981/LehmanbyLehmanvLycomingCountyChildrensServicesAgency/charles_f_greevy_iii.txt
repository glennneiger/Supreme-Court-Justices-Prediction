mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
as
justice
adams
stated
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
third
circuit,
this
present
appeal
compounds
the
delicate
nature
of
parent-child
relationship
with
the
intricacies
of
federal-state
court
comity.
i
might
add
to
that
also
the
historic
statutory
and
present
decisional...
decisional
balance
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
initially,
i'd
like
to
address
several
of
the
questions
or
thoughts
addressed
by
my
brother
mr.
guggenheim.
the
question
was
asked
as
far
as
frank's
status
now.
the
status
of
frank
now,
who
was
18
this
past
december,
he
can
consent
to
his
own
adoption
now
without
the
consent
of
his
parent,
a
right
which
the
court
gave
six
years
ago
when
they
took
the
parental
rights
from
marjorie
lehman.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
i
wouldn't
know
why
he
could
not
do
that,
your
honor.
certainly
he
could
consent
to
the
adoption
by
his
mother.
the
second
question
was
as
far
as
a
direct
appeal.
the
basic
foundation
that
mr.
guggenheim
is
seeking
is
a
hearing
again
on
the
merits
in
this
matter.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
he
indeed
wanted
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
he
had
that
right
back
in
january
of
1978
by
pursuing
his
right
to
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
he
gave
up
that
right.
in
fact,
he
acknowledged
in
the
third
circuit
that
it
was
a
strategic
decision
of
theirs
to
not
seek
a
direct
appeal.
it
was
sort
of
taking
a
second...
getting
a
chance
at
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
they
were
going
to
try
cert.
if
that
didn't
prevail,
then
they
would
file
the
habeas
corpus.
the
question
could
be
raised
whether
or
not
that
same
strategy
might
have
been
looked
to
in
the
santosky
case.
as
i
see
it
there,
the
new
york
court
definitely
did
rule
on
the
constitutional
issue.
i'm
wondering
whether
he
was
looking
for
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
in
santosky
if
this
court
had
not
accepted
cert.--
of
the
seven
circuit
courts
of
appeals
who
have
addressed
this
jurisdictional
issue
directly,
five
have
directly
found
no
jurisdiction,
those
being:
the
first
circuit
in
the
sylvander
case;
the
third
circuit
obviously
in
this
lehman
case;
the
sixth
circuit
in
anh
versus
levi;
the
eighth
circuit
in
syrovatka
versus
erlich;
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
doe
versus
doe.
all
of
these
above
cases
involved
termination
and
adoption
matters.
one
circuit
has
vacillated,
that
being
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
yen
versus
kissinger.
where
they
did
find
jurisdiction
where
the
federal
government
was
involved,
where
it
involved
vietnamese
children
who
were
here
on
what
was
known
as
a
parole
status,
the
tree
top
versus
smith
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
found
no
jurisdiction
in
an
adoption
case.
one
circuit,
the
fifth,
has
said
basically
okay
in
custody
matters.
indeed,
one
of
those
is
the
pending
petition
in
this
court
in
the
chastain
versus
davis
case,
which
also
addressed
the
lassiter
issue
of
lack
of
representation.
mr.
guggenheim
noted
the
question
of
standing.
i
believe
it's
a
very
important
issue
for
the
court
to
look
to.
here
we
have
marjorie
lehman,
who
has
alleged
to
be
filing
her
petition
as
the
next
friend.
goldstein
in
his
book
"beyond
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
"
states
that
a
parent
standing
in
court
as
the
real
party...
a
parent
standing
in
court
is
the
real
party
in
interest;
however,
they're
liable
to
be
defeated
by
their
own
unfitness,
and
the
demand
from
society
is
that
the
child's
interests
prevail
over
the
natural
rights
of
an
unworthy
parent.
certainly
children
have
a
right
to
a
number
of
things--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--no,
we
do
not.
we--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
had
to
show
that
there
was
an
incapacity
and
that
incapacity
would
not
be
remedied.
children
require
several
things.
they
require
security,
they
require
stability
long-term
and
of
a
continuous
nature,
and
includes
also
physical
care,
adequate
food,
shelter
and
clothing,
emotional
security,
and
certainly
sound
intellectual
and
perhaps
even
religious
training.
the
state
has
the
responsibility
to
assure
and
oversee
these
various
rights
of
a
child.
as
stated
in
santosky,
a
state's
goal
is
to
provide
the
child
with
a
permanent
home.
a
child
has
no
voice
in
the
continuing...
the
continuation
of
litigation
in
a
termination
matter.
before
termination
there
is
an
interest
that
the
parent
and
child,
and
even
the
state,
shares--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--your
honor,
certainly
she
would
have
standing--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--because
she
would
stand
in
the
stead
of
a
natural
parent
at
that
point.
that
natural
parent
would
have
that
right.
here
there
was
a
decision
by
the
court--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--that
is
correct.
after
grounds
for
termination
are
established
under
state
law,
the
child
has
a
primary
interest
in
not
only
stability,
but
also
finality
of
the
litigation,
and
the
state
has
that
same
right
in
the
well-being
of
the
child,
looking
not
only
to
physical
and
emotional
well-being,
but
perhaps
even
efforts
to
foster
good
citizens.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
i
think
that
it
brings
up
a
question
that
certainly
after
a
termination
there's
a
realignment
of
interests,
and
in
a
real
sense
perhaps
a
child
needs
a
voice
in
that
termination
decision.
the
argument
we
would
make
is
that
in
delinquency
cases,
which
certainly
the
court
has
recognized
through
habeas
corpus,
the
parent
and
the
child
would
share
an
interest
either
in
a
release
from
probation
or
release
from
even
the
supervision
of
a
probation
officer,
or
in
an
extreme
case
the
child
being
held
in
an
institution.
the
child's
need
of
continuity
conflicts
with
this
absence
of
finality
when
a
termination
is
questioned
and,
as
in
this
case,
appealed.
now,
in
pennsylvania
under
the
new
1980
statute
representation
through
a
guardian
ad
litem
is
given
to
a
child
in
an
involuntary
termination
matter.
heretofore,
and
certainly
in
this
case,
the
agency
was
overseeing
the
interests
of
the
child
in
stability
and
a
long-term
foster
care.
the
second
question
would
deal,
of
course,
directly
with
habeas
corpus.
the
stamp
of
criminal
sanctions
certainly
pervades
the
overwhelming
majority
of
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
are
filed
in
the
federal
courts.
indeed,
attorney
general
william
french
smith
noted
that
last
year
alone
there
were
7800
habeas
petitions
filed
in
the
federal
courts.
these
issues
in
regards
to
state
criminal
matters
indicate
the
judicial
and
social
perception
of
the
scope
of
the
great
writ,
sweeps
aside,
of
course,
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata,
with
no
restriction
or
perhaps
even
a
statute
of
limitation
in
which
the
petition
can
be
filed.
the
statute
looks
to
the
protection
of
individuals
against
the
erosion
of
their
private
rights.
certainly,
it
provides
relief
from
unlawful
custody,
as
was
noted
in
the
several
criminal
cases
discussed
by
mr.
guggenheim.
simply
stated,
a
single
federal
judge
can
overturn
the
highest
court
of
a
state
as
it
relates
to
constitutional
issues
and
the
direct
facts
of
the
case.
the
question
is
whether
the
restraints
are
suffered
by
the
public
generally,
which
was
discussed
in
the
hensley
case.
congress
found
it
appropriate
to
tailor
this
present
habeas
corpus
statute
to
meet
an
existing
need
and
concern
back
in
1867.
it
can
be
justifiably
argued
that
a
major
shifting
in
interpretation
such
as
advocated
by
marjorie
lehman
perhaps
should
await
some
congressional
thought
on
the
matter.
indeed,
i
think
there's
been
some
suggestions
made
by
attorney
general
smith
that
the
habeas
corpus
area
should
be
approached
and
discussed
by
congress
and
decided
what
direction
they
opt
for
here
in
our
common
age.
justices
brennan,
marshall
and
o'connor
in
the
fair
assessment
case
talked
about
that,
subject
only
to
constitutional
restraints,
congress
exclusively
determines
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts.
the
pennsylvania
statute
was
found
not...
was
found
constitutional
back
in
1978,
and
that
has
been
embedded
in
the
law
since.
simply
put,
the
wrongful
restraint
which
is
talked
about
in
habeas
corpus
is
simply
not
the
circumstance
when
we're
dealing
with
rights
termination
matters.
parents'
interests
remain
most
strong
in
preserving
the
family
relationship
after
termination.
as
we've
talked,
the
child's
right
is
in
an
end
to
that
litigation,
the
right
to
then
be
accepted
into
a
stable
home.
the
lehman
boys
have
stood
in
much
the
same
status
as
other
children.
they
are
looking
to...
they
are
subject,
of
course,
to
parental
guidance,
care,
control,
which
is
necessary
for
their
physical
or
mental
well-being.
habeas
corpus
by
its
very
nature
is
intrusive
in
nature
in
a
dual
system
of
state
and
federal
courts
and
is
uninhibited
by
traditional
rules
of
finality
and
federalism,
and
should
be
confined
to
cases
of
special
urgency,
such
as
hensley
talked.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
i
believe
that
that
is
a
proper
remedy
here.
that
was
discussed
very
thoroughly
by
justice
garth
in
the
third
circuit.
certainly
it
would
require
a
choice
of
courts.
they
would
have
to
determine
that
the
constitutional
issues
would
be
reserved
for
the
1983
and
perhaps
not
submitted
in
the
state
court
through
their
procedures.
so
it
does
not
throw
the
litigant
out
of
court.
it
simply
makes
them--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--that
would
be
my
view.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
if
it
is
not
time-barred,
that
is
correct.
here
certainly
there
was...
the
essence
of
time
was
looked
at
here,
that
they
immediately
upon
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decision
filed
the
writ
of
certiorari
within
the
time
limitation.
but
1983
could
have
been
pursued
after
an
appeal.
certainly
they
had
contested
all
the
constitutional
issues
from
the
orphans
court
on
up.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
it
would,
because
the
same
issues
would
be
raised.
they
have
raised
the--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--1983
would
not
be,
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
it
was
a
choice
of
remedies
that
they
had
back--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--that
foreclosed
the
1983.
it
certainly
would
not
have
foreclosed
the
direct
appeal
which
they
could
have
pursued.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
we
chose
that,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
it
would
be
my
position
that
they
could
not
have,
unless
they
had
another
constitutional
issue
that
they
were
going
to
raise
against
the
pennsylvania
statute.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
other
than
the
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
remedy
in
this
matter--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--it
would
not
be.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
that
is
correct.
another
issue
raised
by
mr.
guggenheim
is
that
the
granting
of
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
corpus
would
not
open
the
gates
to
a
full
range
of
other
cases.
it
is
my
strong
belief
that
it
would
open
the
case
for
private
litigants
in
particular
fact
circumstances
where
the
federal
court
would
be
looking
to
constitutional
issues,
that
we
would
have
private
litigating
parties
continuing
to
fight
while
there
was
still
a
forum
that
would
hear
their
argument,
which
is
easily
borne
out
in
this
lehman
matter.
certainly,
a
core
issue
as
recognized
by
the
third
circuit
and
herein
would
be
the
question
of
federal-state
relationships.
as
recognized
this
term,
the
principle
of
comity
refers
to
the
proper
respect
for
state
functions
that
organs
of
the
national
government,
most
particularly
the
federal
courts,
are
expected
to
demonstrate
in
the
exercise
of
their
own
legitimate
powers.
justice
rehnquist
last
week
in
santosky
stated
that
family
law
has
been
left
to
the
states
since
time
immemorial,
and
not
without
good
reason.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
but
certainly
it...
but
note,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--the
issues
here
certainly
are
very
close,
and
certainly
it
is
a
matter
that
the
court
has
to
look
to.
certainly,
it's
been
often
cited
that
the
whole
subject
of
domestic
relations
belongs
with
the
state
courts.
they
have
the
historic...
they've
historically
decided
the
issues,
they've
developed
well-known
expertise,
and
they
have
a
strong
interest
in
disposing
of
the
issues.
i
think
that
santosky
does
note--
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
--i'm
not
saying
that
it
should
be
overruled.
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
was
very
happy
to
see
that
the
lehman
case
was
cited
in
the
santosky
decision.
i
believe
that
what
santosky
does,
does
state
to
us,
is
that
this
court
has
given
some
guidelines.
they've
indicated
that
there
is
concern
when
the
family
is
involved,
not
only
natural
parents
but
foster
parents.
you
said
last
term
in
lassiter
that
the
question
of
lawyers
can
be
decided
on
a
case
by
case,
but
very
firmly
said
that
when
you're
looking
to
the
burden
of
proof
look
to
clear
and
convincing,
put
the
presumption
with
the
parents.
pennsylvania
has
used
the
clear
and
convincing.
examination
of
the...
even
the
orphans
court
decision
back
in
june
of
'76,
judge
roupt
very
strongly
stated
that
he
was...
in
fact,
the
only
case
cited
at
the
case
is
a
case
cited
in
my
brief,
in
re
geiger,
which
holds
the
clear
and
convincing
burden
necessary.
now
that
this
court
has
spoken
to
these
issues
regarding
family
matters,
i
believe
that
this
court
can
step
back,
perhaps
is
the
word,
and
let
the
states
administer
these
cases,
see
how
the
states
do
with
it.
there
is
certainly
an
overview
by
this
court,
not
only
through
the
direct
appeal
but
through
1983
in
appropriate
circumstances.
let's
give
the
states
a
chance
to
determine
how
they
are
going
to
administer
their
statutes.
don't
impose
the
intrusive
nature
of
habeas
corpus
into
this
area.
i'd
like
to
conclude
that
if
this
case
was
ripe
for
decision
on
its
merits,
then
it
was
in
1978
when
this
petitioner
chose
not
to
exercise
her
direct
right
of
appeal.
she
should
not
be
given
a
second
bite
at
that
apple
through
the
collateral
remedy
by
establishing
federal
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
the
opportunity
to
speak
very
firmly
to
the
balancing
of
parental
and
child
interests
in
this
matter
by
retaining
the
present
basis
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
affirmation
of
the
third
circuit
decision
will
promote
finality
and
stability
in
the
realm
of
children's
rights.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
in
what
manner,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
yes,
we
could.
custody
is
one
of
the
issues
here.
but
this
court
can
decide
that,
regardless
of
the
literal
interpretation
of
this
statute,
that
there
are
other
reasons
why
this
court
should
refrain
from
extending
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
mr.
charles
f.
greevy,
iii
right.
policy,
as
mr.
guggenheim
noted.
the
court
can
help
to
guard
against
the
preservation
of
a
child's
uneasy
status
quo
and
the
limbo
of
foster
care.
we
submit
that,
based
upon
the
very
thorough
and
strongly
held
first
and
third
circuit
positions,
this
court
should
reject
this
extension
of
habeas
corpus
statutes
into
the
parental
rights
termination
area
of
family
law,
which
is
controlled
and
administered
by
the
states.
mr.
charles

greevy,
iii
i
would
believe
so,
your
honor.
certainly
the
youngest
boy,
mark,
was
less
than
one
year
of
age
when
this
case...
when
he
was
put
into
a
foster
home.
he
was
a
little
over
the
age
of
seven
when
the
court
decided
that
he
could
be
adopted
by
his
foster
parents.
certainly
you've
noted
the
exhibit
attached
to
my
brief,
where
there
was
discussion
as
far
as
visitation
with
these
children
pending
the
decision
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
therein,
all
three
boys
expressed
a
desire
not
to
visit.
indeed,
the
two
youngest
boys,
mark
and
william,
were
very
anxious
for
an
adoption
by
their
foster
parents.
this
interest
and
this
desire
has
continued
to
the
present
time.
certainly,
as
discussed
initially,
frank
is
too
old
at
this
point.
in
fact,
the
middle
boy
has
been
in
the
same
foster
home
since
the
day
he
was
put
into
foster
care.
and
this
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
denial
of
federal
habeas
corpus,
and
that's
to
get
children
like
william
and
mark
and
frank
lehman
out
of
the
limbo
of
foster
care
and
into
stable
continuity
and
stable
homes.
