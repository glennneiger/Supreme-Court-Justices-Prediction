in
1971,
the
indiana
legislature
enacted
a
statute
that
provides
for
the
extinction
of
severed
mineral
interest
that
are
not
used
for
a
period
of
20
years
or
an
additional
grace
period
of
two
years
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
the
use
of
a
mineral
that
will
--
mineral
interest
that
will
prevent
it
from
becoming
extinguished
by
reason
of
non-use
is
either
the
payment
of
taxes
on
it,
the
attempt
to
exploit
it
in
some
way
or
to
develop
it
in
any
way
or
simply
to
file
a
statement
of
interest
in
the
county
reportersâ€™
office
within
the
period
to
show
that
the
owner
intends
to
maintain
ownership.
now,
this
case
is
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
by
former
owners
of
mineral
interests
whose
interest
were
extinguished
by
the
automatic
operation
of
the
statute.
they
attack
it
as
a
taking
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
as
an
impairment
of
contract
and
they
claim
that
the
failure
of
the
legislature
require
specific
notice
before
the
abandonment
or
extinction
takes
place
is
a
procedural
defect
that
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional.
for
reasons
stated
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reject
these
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statute
as
did
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
we
conclude
that
the
grace
period
of
two
years
is
sufficient
to
give
the
mineral
interest
owners
an
opportunity
to
become
aware
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute
and
that
they
have
a
duty
to
keep
informed
as
to
the
condition
of
their
own
property
within
the
state.
a
dissenting
opinion
has
been
filed
by
justice
brennan,
which
is
joined
by
justice
white,
justice
marshall,
and
justice
powell.
