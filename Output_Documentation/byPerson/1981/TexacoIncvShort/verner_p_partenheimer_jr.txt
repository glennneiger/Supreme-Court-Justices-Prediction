mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
commence
by
attempting
to
clarify
for
justice
stevens
what
i
believe
is
probably
the
situation
concerning
severed
mineral
taxation
in
both
indiana
and,
insofar
as
i
know,
the
state
of
illinois,
which
is
about
the
limits
of
my
general
knowledge
about
this
subject.
the
policy
seems
to
be
that
if
the
interest
is
being
developed
or
is
in
use,
then
it
is
subject
to
a
form
of
local
ad
valorem
taxation.
also,
if
it
is
owned
by
a
coal
company
or
some
operative
organization
which
is
in
the
process
of
producing
coal,
then
generally
that
interest
is
placed
on
the
tax
rolls
and
assessed
for
taxation.
otherwise,
interests
in
the
hands
of
individuals
are
generally
considered
perhaps
not
very
valuable
and
that
it's
not
administratively
very
remunerative
to
impose
taxes.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
in
these
states
it's
real
property
in
both
instances,
yes,
sir.
the
indiana
dormant
mineral
act
we
submit
is
essentially
a
recording
act.
the
general
assembly
determined
that
because
of
the
elusive
character
of
severed
minerals,
these
types
of
interest
required
a
re
recording
periodically
for
the
maintenance
of
the
public
records.
it
also
acts
as
a
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
claims
which
remain,
for
whatever
reason,
unrecorded
for
a
long
period
of
time.
the
type
of
severances
most
affected
by
this
act
are
severances
of
coal,
oil,
gas
or
any
or
all
of
them,
either
by
a
mineral
deed
or
by
a
reservation
in
a
general
warranty
deed,
and
these
severances
generally
are
perpetual
on
their
face.
unfortunately,
the
record
in
this
case
comes
to
the
court
without
any
factual
background
concerning
why
the
statute
may
have
been
enacted
or
why
it
was
necessary.
and
if
you
will,
i'm
going
to
ask
the
court
to
permit
me
to
indulge
in
a
few
assumptions
which
i
believe
are
reasonable
and
would
form
the
basis
of
this
statute
in
the
mind
of
a
legislator
dealing
with
it.
first
of
all,
my
home
county,
gibson
county,
has
a
total
area
of
about
320,000
acres,
or
approximately
500
sections.
there's
not
one
section
in
that
county
that
has
not
been
drilled
for
oil,
and
approximately
40
%
of
the
county
has
been
involved
in
coal
development
at
one
time
or
another.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
yes,
sir,
southwestern
indiana.
there
are
approximately
seven
mineral
producing
counties
in
southwestern
indiana,
and
the
rest
of
the
state
is
essentially
non
mineral
producing.
this
oil
and
gas
and
coal
development
has
occurred
in
really
three
phases
for
oil
and
perhaps
two
phases
for
coal,
and
it's
been
over
a
period
of
about
three
generations.
determining
the
ownership
of
land
and
interests
in
land
from
the
public
records,
as
i'm
sure
some
of
you
are
aware,
is
a
difficult,
time
consuming
and
very
expensive
job.
in
my
county,
i
have
concluded
from
my
own
estimates
that
probably
15
%
or
48,000
acres
may
be
affected
by
severed
mineral
claims.
and
if
i
project
this
throughout
the
state,
i'm
of
the
opinion
at
least
that
probably
336,000
acres
or
1
%
of
the
entire
state
is
affected
by
these
types
of
severed
mineral
claims.
so
that
it
is,
you
can
see,
a
rather
localized
problem.
in
my
opinion,
the
total
number
of
claimants;
that
is,
persons,
affected
by
this
act
throughout
the
state
may
be
as
many
as
40,000,
and
perhaps
10,000
have
had
their
rights
extinguished
under
the
act
through
their
own
failure
to
comply.
so
i
hope
that
this
gives
you
an
idea
at
least
of
what
i
consider
to
be
the
size
of
the
problem.
for
the
most
part,
these
claims
have
been
treated
as
valueless
until
they've
been
developed.
they've
not
been
assessed
for
taxes
and
estates
have
been
settled
in
which
they
have
not
been
accounted
for,
they
are
not
referred
to
in
the
preparation
of
persons'
wills.
so
that
after
a
generation
or
two
or
three,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
interests
become
very
intricately
fractionalized
and
very
difficult
to
track
down
as
a
matter
of
public
record.
so
this
is
the
situation
in
which
the
general
assembly
sought
to
construct
a
legislative
remedy.
that
remedy,
needless
to
say,
had
to
be
effective
and
efficient
and
should
not
have
been
unduly
harsh.
we
think
that
the
legislature
has
done
that.
it
may
not
be
the
proper
answer
for
all
states,
but
we
think
it's
a
proper
answer
for
indiana.
the
mineral
claimants
have
relied
on
the
pennsylvania
coal
company
case,
stating
that
the
act
effects
a
taking
without
compensation.
we
think
that
the
act
has
provided
a
means
whereby
any
claimant
can
preserve
his
interest.
it's
a
simple
and
inexpensive
means;
he
can
simply
file
once
each
20
years
periodically,
and
he
loses
nothing
if
he
complies
with
the
act.
if
you
will,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
the
act
has
simply
taken
a
single
strand
of
this
bundle
of
rights;
that
is,
the
single
right
to
hold
that
interest
perpetually
in
the
future
without
a
corresponding
duty
or
obligation
to
periodically
keep
the
public
records
up
to
date
by
making
a
re
recording.
we
think
that
the
act
in
this
regard
and
this
case
are
similar,
for
example,
to
the
eagle-relick
case,
where
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
who
suggested
that
the
appellants
in
that
case
were
attempting
to
compel
the
government
to
regulate
by
purchase.
we
think
this
case
falls
in
that
category
so
far
as
the
taking
question
is
concerned.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
the
property,
mr.
justice
white,
does
not
escheat
to
the
state
in--
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
--i
think
that
that
question
can
be
answered
with
reference
to
the
dormant
mineral
act
cases...
i
mean
the
dormant
bank
account
cases,
and
i
will
get
to
those
in
a
minute.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
well,
i
think
when
you
interpose
a
taking
by
the
state
where
the
state
itself
obtains
some
proprietary
interest,
then
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
well,
then
you
get
into
the
issue
of
a
taking
by
the
state
for
the
purposes
of
the
state.
i'm
reluctant
to
push
that
very
far--
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
--well,
we
prefer
to
think
that
it
is
an
extinguishment
for
purposes
of--
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
--for
the
purpose
of
restoring
the
integrity
of
the
property.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
recording
acts
in
various
circumstances
where
there
is
a
justifiable
public
need,
which
do
just
that.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
i
think
the--
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
--i
think
that
if
there
is
an
overriding
public
policy,
the
state
certainly
can,
and
there
are
instances
in
which
the
state
has
done
just
that.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
well,
i
grant
you
the
case
you
put
seems
rather
harsh,
and
i
suppose
it's
difficult
to
disagree
with
you,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
have
a
situation
here
in
which
there
is
notice
of
the
law
in
which
a
simple
remedy
was
provided.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
it's
conceivable,
yes,
sir.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
i
don't
assume
that
people
in
general
in
those
situations
know
the
law.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
presumptions
that
the
law
has
to
make
in
certain
circumstances,
and
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
to
be
made
in
certain
circumstances
and
this
is
one
of
them.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
probably
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
just
that;
whether
or
not
the
incorporation
of
a
traditional
grace
period
in
this
type
of
law
is
still
a
constitutionally
acceptable
method
of
making
the
law
work
retroactively.
in
connection
with
that
central
issue,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
early
dormant
bank
account
cases.
three
of
them
have
been
cited,
security
bank
v.
california,
anderson
national
bank
v.
luckett
and
standard
oil
v.
new
jersey.
in
the
security
bank
and
standard
oil
cases,
the
act
provided
for
an
adjudication,
a
final
adjudication
of
abandonment
of
these
bank
accounts,
and
at
the
same
time
provided
for
a...
more
or
less
simultaneously
provided
for...
a
seizure
of
the
bank
accounts.
the
court
in
these
two
cases
was
dealing
with
not
the
depositor
himself,
but
with
the
bank
who
naturally
wanted
to
keep
the
windfall,
wanted
to
appropriate
the
windfall
for
itself
rather
than
turn
it
over
to
the
state,
and
was
arguing
that
it
would
be
placed
in
double
jeopardy
if
it
had
to
give
up
the
deposit
without
some
kind
of
good
notice
to
the
depositor.
the
court
held
that
a
simple
newspaper
publication
was
adequate
for
a
notice
to
the
depositor,
so
far
as
protection
to
the
bank
from
double
jeopardy
was
concerned
because
it
was
an
in
rem
proceeding.
and
i
believe,
certainly
in
the
security
bank
case
and
i
believe
also
in
the
standard
oil
case,
the
court
did
not
decide
any
issues
of
constitutionality
between
the
depositor
himself
and
the
state.
i
think
those
cases
were
cases
wherein
adjudication
was
provided
for,
a
court
adjudication,
and
the
court
simply
held
that
notice
by
publication
was
sufficient.
the
luckett
case
was
a
bit
different.
in
that
case,
the
portion
of
the
act
which
was
appealed
from
only
involved
a
transfer
of
custody
of
the
deposit
from
the
bank
to
the
state
through
an
administrative
proceeding
by
the
attorney
general.
in
that
case,
the
holding
of
the
court
especially
indicated
that
all
of
us,
or
all
persons
who
deposit
money
in
banks
in
the
state
make
those
deposits
with
notice
of
the
conditions
which
the
state
imposes
by
law
upon
those
deposits,
and
that
we
must
be
presumed
to
have
notice
that
under
certain
circumstances
the
surrender
of
our
bank
accounts
to
the
state
may
be
compelled.
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
so
far
as
the
seizure
of
the
property
itself
was
concerned,
the
in
rem
matter,
that
the
posting
of
a
notice
on
the
courthouse
door
was
a
sufficient
form
of
notice
to
give
to
provide
administrative
jurisdiction
to
the
seizure.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
five
years,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
yes,
five
years
i
believe.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
no,
but
this
indiana
statute
does
not
provide
for
an
adjudication,
either.
the
thought
that
you
have
is
the
fact
that
in
the
new
jersey
case
the
statute
provided
a
final
adjudication,
but
then
said
that
anyone
who,
because
of
lack
of
privy
or
lack
of
notice,
was
not
bound
by
that
adjudication
had
a
five
year
statute
of
limitation
in
which
to
sort
of
come
in
and
reopen
the
matter.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
no,
it
does
not
because
the
statute
itself
provides
for
no
adjudication
at
all.
there
is
no
proceeding
at
all
involved.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
in
the
case
justice
brennan
put,
i
would
agree,
yes.
while
we're
on
that
subject
i
would
simply
argue
to
the
court
that
not
one
of
those
cases,
nor
any
other
case,
has
ever
held
that
an
administrative
or
judicial
proceeding
is
a
necessary
element
of
due
process
in
a
law
affecting
property
rights.
in
this
case
the
appellants
argue
for
notice
of
extinguishment
of
their
rights.
well
certainly,
notice
would
be
of
no
value
to
them
unless
they
had
the
opportunity
to
do
something
about
it
after
the
notice
were
given.
title
puritive
legislation
characteristically
has
not
done
this.
it
relies
on
independent
remedies
such
as
ejectment
and
quiet
title
proceedings,
and
we
think
there
are
some
practical
reasons
for
that
and
i'd
like
to
mention
just
two
or
three.
first,
there
is
a
great
difficulty
in
identifying
and
locating
who
are
the
persons
who
would
be...
to
whom
the
act
would
be
applicable.
we
can't
send
a
copy
of
the
general
laws
to
every
citizen,
and
if
we
did
that
still
wouldn't
provide
him
with
any
realistic
notice
of
anything.
secondly,
if
these
people
could
be
identified
and
located,
who
has
the
motivation
to
do
it?
certainly
not
the
state.
the
state
has
no
obligation.
certainly
not
the
owner
of
the
servient
interest.
why
would
that
person
who
had
the
estate
which
was
subservient,
why
would
he
be
interested
in
providing
notice
to
someone
who
was
away
and
who
had
left
his
property
and
advise
him
that
he
should
come
back
and
do
something
to
preserve
it
and
take
advantage
of
it.
there
simply
is
no
logic
that
a
statute
of
that
type
would
work.
and
finally,
the
public
policy
is
as
well
served
by
the
extinguishment
of
the
right
as
by
any
other
result.
therefore,
we
think
that
there
have
been
good
reasons
for
the
simple
use
of
grace
periods.
the
statute
is
enacted,
a
grace
period
is
allowed,
and
people
are
presumed
after
a
certain
period
of
time
to
have
had
sufficient
interest
in
a
property
to
care
for
it.
this
philosophy
and
reasoning
of
course
has
been
annunciated
many
times.
personally,
i
like
the
view
by
justice
mckenna
in
a
relatively
old
case,
ballard
v.
hunter,
that's
204
us
at
262,
and
if
i
may,
i'm
going
to
quote
just
a
little
bit
of
his
philosophy
concerning
this
matter.
he
says,
"the
law
cannot
give
personal
notice
of
its
provisions
or
proceedings
to
everyone.
"
"of
what
concerns
or
may
concern
their
real
estate,
men
usually
keep
informed.
"
"and
on
that
probability
the
law
may
frame
its
proceedings.
"
"indeed,
must
frame
them
and
assume
the
care
of
proper
to
be
universal
if
it
would
give
efficiency
to
many
of
its
exercises.
"
i
have
two
further
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
i
won't
argue
the
contract
impairment
theory
because
the
opponent
does
not
argue
it
and
we
simply
feel
that
it
is
a
slight
regulatory
impairment,
and
the
same
reasoning
applies
as
applies
with
regard
to
the
taking
issue.
the
remaining
matter
that
i'd
like
to
discuss
just
briefly
is
equal
protection.
in
the
briefs,
we
think
the
appellants'
equal
protection
arguments
are
strained
if
not
a
little
misleading.
the
section
5
of
the
act
has
not
one
but
four
requirements;
all
of
which
are
equally
important.
it
requires,
number
one,
that
the
owner
have
had
ten
or
more
interests
in
the
county.
number
two,
that
he
had
made
a
diligent
effort
to
preserve
those
interests.
number
three,
that
he
had,
in
fact,
preserved
some
interests
in
the
county.
and
number
four,
that
his
failure
to
preserve
was
through
inadvertence.
we
think
it
fair
to
say
that
the
legislature
could
have
concluded
and
reasonably
so
that
a
person
who
has
ten
or
more
interests
in
the
same
county
probably
owns
them
as
a
block,
and
probably
acquired
them
for
the
purpose
of
development
and
probably
would,
in
fact,
develop
these
rights
rather
than
simply
hold
and
speculate
on
them.
we
think
the
legislature
could
have
concluded
that
one
holding
ten
or
more
interests
might
have
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
inadvertently
losing
one
or
more
than
one
through
a
mis
filing
or
an
error
in
filing,
a
clerical
misfeasance
of
some
kind.
and
we
think
that
the
legislature
could
have
concluded
that
such
an
error
might
bring
on
a
very
significant
loss,
or
a
more
significant
loss,
to
someone
who
held
a
lost
of
interests
in
a
block
as
opposed
to
someone
who
held
only
one
or
very
few
scattered
interests.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that's
a
debatable
question.
the
extent
of
the--
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
that
would
be.
i
agree
with
you
on
the
equal
protection
question
as
such.
i
don't
know
that
the
due
process
standard
is
always
the
same,
depending
upon
the
quality
or
quantity
of
the
interest
involved.
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
means
provided
that
is
simple
and
expedient
by
a
simple
re
recording
or
re
filing
to
preserve
this
interest
indefinite--
mr.
verner
p.
partenheimer,
jr.
--oh,
no.
in
the
pennsylvania
act,
once
the
act
took
place,
their
rights
were
gone,
irretrievably.
i
have
one
final
point
to
make,
and
that
is
that
the
appellants
and
the
trial
court
in
this
case
tended
to
focus
on
the
issue
of
who
was
a
known
owner
and
who
might
be
an
unknown
owner,
and
to
try
to
distinguish
between
those.
in
the
situation
as
we
perceive
it,
the
question
of
who
is
an
unknown
owner
and
who
is
a
known
owner
can
only
be
determined
by
some
kind
of
an
objective
standard.
everyone
is
unknown
until
he
either
makes
himself
known
or
until
someone
hunts
him
down
and
makes
him
known.
we
think
that
the
statute
has
provided
an
objective
standard
to
determine
who
is
going
to
be
treated
as
known
and
who
is
going
to
be
treated
as
unknown.
those
persons
who
have
used
their
interest
or
who
have
filed
will
be
considered
known.
those
persons
who
have
not,
will
be
considered
as
unknown.
and
accordingly,
we
think
that
this
objective
standard,
together
with
the
filing
alternative
and
the
incorporation
of
the
grace
period
to
cover
the
retroactive
situation
entitles
this
law
to
be
treated
as
a
constitutional
exercise
of
the
regulatory
power
of
the
state,
and
that
the
decision
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
on
this
issue
should
be
affirmed.
