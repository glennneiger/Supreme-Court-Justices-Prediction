unknown
speaker
they've
also
been
determined
to
be
defeasible
after
20
years,
though,
have
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
part
of
indiana
property
law,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
would
say
this
act
is
perfectly
all
right
prospectively
but
not
retroactively.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
a
notice
in
any
statute
of
limitations,
do
you?
to
take
a
typical
state
statute
of
limitation
for
adverse
possession
for
real
property,
open
and
notorious
possession
for
ten
years.
when
that
time
is
run,
title
changes
and
there
isn't
any
notice
that
you
get.
unknown
speaker
but
indiana,
in
effect
then,
has
given
you
more
than
you
say
a
statute
of
limitations
would.
unknown
speaker
they've
given
you
a
grace
period.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
carroll,
suppose
it
were
a
proceeding
between
the
mineral
owner
and
the
surface
owner,
who
i
gather
is
the
beneficiary
of
this
statute,
say
to
build
a
quiet
title
brought
by
the
mineral
owner
against
the
surface
owner.
and
the
surface
owner
does
not
interpose
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
the
surface
owner
automatically
prevails?
is
that
it?
this
is
not...
statute
of
limitations
are
ordinarily
a
matter
of
defense,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
that's
unusual,
as
my
brother
rehnquist
suggests,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
can
you
suggest
any
statutes
of
limitations
that
have
notice
provisions?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
really
eliminate
the
interest.
it
eliminates
the
enforcement
of
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
the
right--
unknown
speaker
--the
right
to
enforce?
unknown
speaker
but
this
effects
a
defeasance
of
the
title,
then,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
the
transfer
of
the
title
to
someone
else.
unknown
speaker
so
for
that
reason
you
say
this
is
not
really
a
statute
of
limitations--
unknown
speaker
--it
goes
way
beyond
that.
unknown
speaker
well
congress,
shortly
after
the
second
world
war
after
this
court
had
made
its
portal
to
portal
pay
ruling
retroactively
made
them
inapplicable,
did
it
not,
and
that
statute
was
never
struck
down.
unknown
speaker
second
circuit.
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
the
state
changed
its
adverse
possession
law
from
20
to
10
years?
unknown
speaker
i
assumed
my
question
was
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
it
would
be
any
state's
adverse
possession
law...
i
don't
understand
all
these
qualifications
you're
putting
in.
it
just
says
the
same
law
that
required
20
now
requires
10,
period.
nothing
else.
what's
wrong
with
it?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
know
that
adverse
possession
was
a
statute
of
limitations.
it's
a
different
animal.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
does.
and
i
think
a
state
can
do
it,
don't
you?
can
change
it?
well,
could
the
state
change
it
to
30?
unknown
speaker
but
it
can't
change
it
to
ten?
unknown
speaker
is
that
retroactive?
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
at
your
point
about
you
have
to
give
notice.
because
i'm
waiting
for
that
case--
unknown
speaker
--i'd
like
to
see
that
case
about
this
notice.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carroll,
this
statute
had
no
retroactive
effect,
did
it?
supposing
it...
it
was
passed
in
1971,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
supposing
everybody
in
the
state
got
a
copy
of
the
statute
when
it
was
passed,
and
everybody
was
told,
in
effect,
if
you
don't
pay
any
taxes
on
your
mineral
interests
in
the
next
two
years,
they
will
no
longer
be
your
property.
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
don't
we
normally
presume
that
the
citizens
have
notice
of
the
statutes
that
are
passed?
unknown
speaker
your
case
rests
on
the
assumption
that
that's
an
unrealistic
presumption?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lot
of
people
know
the
law,
particularly
if
they
invest
in
mineral
rights
and
if
they
generally
follow
what
goes--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you've
got
two
years
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed.
unknown
speaker
two
years
in
which
to
perform
a
duty
you
should
be
performing
in
any
event.
you
have
a
duty
to
pay
taxes,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
it's
a
state
that
says
publication
is
notice.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carroll,
under
indiana
law,
may
mineral
rights
be
taxed
separately?
unknown
speaker
are
they
taxed?
unknown
speaker
is
it
up
to
the
county?
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
are
taxed
by
the
county,
does
the
county
send
out
notices
of
taxes
due?
unknown
speaker
were
any
notices
received
in
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
none
of
the
property
involved
in
this
case
involved--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
i
understand
that,
i'm
familiar
with
the
virginia
statute
in
that
respect.
but
that
would
have
put
you
on
notice
that
you'd
received
a
tax
assessment.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
knew
some
counties
in
indiana
were
taxing
mineral
rights,
would
that
have
suggested
the
desirability
of
making
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
may
be
a
more
desirable
way
to
deal
with
it,
but
don't
you
have
to
convince
us
that
the
way
indiana
has
chosen
to
deal
with
it
violates
the
federal
constitution
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carroll,
how
does
that
differ
really
in
terms
of
procedure
from
other
marketable
title
statutes
or
recording
acts
or
adverse
possession
laws?
i
just
don't
think
that
i
perceive
the
procedural
differences.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
want
to
be
concerned
with
the
purpose,
but
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you're
objecting
to
the
procedure,
and
i
don't
see
how
the
difference
in
purpose
is
significant
if
it's
the
procedural
due
process
that
you're
concerned
with.
unknown
speaker
so
would
it
be
your
position
that
the
marketable
titles
act
and
the
adverse
possession
act
nationwide
would
be
defective
on
the
same
ground?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
your
distinction
that
procedural
due
process
depends
on
whether
the
state
had
a
benign
purpose
or
a
non
benign
purpose.
i
thought
it
was
simply
procedural
due
process
meant
a
matter
of
adequate
notice,
regardless
of
the
state's
purpose.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
change
in
the
rate
of
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
a
notice
to
be
sent
to
each
taxpayer?
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute,
counsel.
an
abandonment
is
generally
intended
to
be
an
intentional
act?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
do
it
by
negligence
and
confusion
and
lapse
of
memory.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us,
in
most
states?
unknown
speaker
and
adverse
possessors.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carroll,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
indiana
practice
on
taxing
these
interests.
i
think
you
indicated
they
tax
them
in
some
counties
and
not
in
others.
unknown
speaker
but
in
those
counties
in
which
they
do
not
tax,
do
they
not
tax
any
mineral
interests,
no
matter
how
valuable,
or
is
it
that
there
is
a
practical--
unknown
speaker
--but
are
there...
are
you
suggesting
there
are
counties
in
which
they
impose
no
taxes
at
all
on
mineral
interests
regardless
of
their
value?
unknown
speaker
i
got
the
impression
it
was
kind
of
a
question
if
there
are
nickels
and
dimes
they
don't
bother
but
it
there's
a
significant
amount
of
money
involved,
they
might.
unknown
speaker
because
if
it's
such
a
petty
amount,
then
there's
kind
of
an
administrative
explanation
for
not
spending
more
money
on
notice
and
foreclosure
and
all
the
rest
in
order
to
collect
35
cents
in
tax.
unknown
speaker
your
time
is
running
now.
are
you
going
to
address
the
taking
question?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
state
passes
a
statute
and
says
that
the
state
hereby
acquires
an
easement
over
a
certain
described
part
of
the
state
and
specifically
described
the
property,
and
that
this
easement
will
not
be
paid
for
unless
somebody...
unless
everybody
who
should
know
about
this
law
comes
in
and
asks
for
it
within
two
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
also
that
it's
a
taking
even
if
there's
notice?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
it
is
real
property
and
not
personal
property
in
these
states,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
this
is
southwestern
indiana?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
case
would
be
any
different
if
the
provision
was
that
if
there's
not
the
filing
within
two
years
that
the
property
escheat
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
doesn't,
but
i
just
ask
you
would
the
question
be
the
same
if
it
did
provide
for
escheat
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
so
your
short
answer
is
yes,
it
would
be
the
same
case
on
the
taking.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
could
say
that
there
should
be...
it's
less
likely
that
there'd
be
a
taking
then
because
here,
to
the
extent
there's
a
taking
it's
a
taking
for
private
use.
it's
taking
a
fee
interest
in
the
one
piece
of
property
owned
by
x
and
giving
it
to
y.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
would.
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
i've
got
you
interrupted,
what
if
this
act
not
only
applied
to
mineral
interests,
but
to
all
real
property;
any
real
property
owner
that
didn't
file
his
statement
within
two
years
loses
his
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
i'll
just
pose
a
case
where
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
as
to
who
owns
the
property,
there's
no
doubt
about
it
whatsoever.
the
taxes
are
paid;
the
person
just
happens
to
live
out
of
the
state
and
never
heard
of
the
law,
and
doesn't
file.
do
you
think
the
state
can
take
his
property
that
way?
unknown
speaker
without
notice?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
without
paying
him
for
it
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
notice
of
the
law,
but
the
fact
is
you
say
these
dormant
interests
have
become
very
splintered
because
they
go
through
various
estates
and
there
may
be
100
different
owners
living
all
over
the
united
states.
right?
is
that
what
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
part
of
the
problem
that
you
wanted
to
cure,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
can
assume
that
all
those
people
living
in
new
york
and
alaska
would
know
that
they
ought
to
file
an
interest.
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
were
going
to
relate
this
to
the
escheat
of
bank
accounts...
abandoned,
neglected
bank
accounts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
partenheimer,
is
my
recollection
correct
that
at
least
in
the
new
jersey
case...
i
think
i
know
something
about
that
statute...
there
was
a
period
of
years
after
the
seizure
when
the
depositor
was
able
to
begin
a
proceeding
and
get
his
money
back.
unknown
speaker
was
it
a
number
of
years?
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
like
that
under
this
indiana
statute,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
but
that
does
not
happen
in
indiana
as
to
these
mineral
rights,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
that
period
allowed
is
something
like
the
redemption
period
after
the
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage
or
a
trust,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
case
that
says
that
due
process
and
equal
protection
is
measured
by
how
much
money
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
debatable
if
you
could
give
me
a
case.
i
don't
think
any
protection
has
ever
been
considered
that
it
only
applies
to
the
poor
and
doesn't
apply
to
the
rich,
or
only
applies
to
the
rich
and
doesn't
apply
to
the
poor.
that's
drawing
the
line
on
people
who
have
got
money,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
partenheimer,
may
i
ask,
what
was
your
answer
to
your
colleague's
reliance
on
mahon
on
the
taking
question?
unknown
speaker
something
not
present
under
the
pennsylvania
scheme
in
mahon?
