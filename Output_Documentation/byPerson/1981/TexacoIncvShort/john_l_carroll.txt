mr.
john
l.
carroll
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
present
here
today
four
constitutional
issues
involving
an
indiana
statute.
these
issues
relate
to
procedural
due
process,
taking,
equal
protection
and
impairment
of
contracts.
because
of
the
shortness
of
time
of
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
limit
my
argument
to
two
issues,
procedural
due
process
and
taking.
the
nature
of
the
interest
which
is
involved
and
which
we
say
has
been
unlawfully
and
unconstitutionally
extinguished
by
the
state
of
indiana
is
a
fee
simple
mineral
interest,
usually
in
the
state
of
indiana
dealing
with
oil,
gas
and
coal.
under
indiana
state
property
law,
those
fee
simple
mineral
interests
have
been
determined
to
be
vested
property
interests,
separate
and
distinct
from
the
surface
ownership--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--the
statute
itself
has
determined
that,
your
honor--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--not
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
in
terms
of
prospectively,
on
any
deeds
which
are
created
after
the
date
of
the
act,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it
being
constitutional
and
valid.
yes,
sir.
it
is
the
retroactive
nature
of
it
and
the
lack
of
notice
inherent
within
the
statute
that
we
think
has
the
constitutional
flaw.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
correct.
we
think
this
is
not
similar,
justice
rehnquist,
to
a
statute
of
limitations
because
it
is
essentially
different
in
its
character
and
primarily
different
because
the
intent
of
the
statute,
as
we
see
it
both
in
terms
of
what
briefs
have
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
and
the
state
as
well
as
the
decision
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
was,
to
extinguish
these
interests,
and
the
notice
provision,
the
grace
period
provision,
was
merely
incidental
to
that
but
it
was
not
with
the
intent
of
preserving
the
interest.
now,
statutes
of
limitation,
by
their
very
nature,
go
to
the
question
of
retaining
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process.
they're
saying
that
we
don't
want
courts
to
make
judgments
about
matters
which
are
stale
causes
of
action.
here,
there
never
was
a
cause
of
action
dealing
with
this
property
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
no,
i--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--they
have
given
us
a
grace
period,
and
even
statutes
of
limitations,
if
you're
going
to
shorten
a
statute
of
limitation,
your
honor,
requires
a
grace
period.
it
is
true
that
the
cases
say
that
there
is
no
vested
right
in
a
statute
of
limitation.
we
say
there
is
a
vested
right
in
this
property
which
is
involved
here,
but
in
terms
of
statutes
of
limitations,
everybody
understands
that
a
time
is
running
on
a
cause
of
action.
and
you
have
to
understand
there
is
a
time
limitation
after
which
it
runs
out.
that
was
not
true
of
the
interests
that
are
involved
here
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act.
and
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
a
statute
of
limitations
is
to
retain
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process,
is
a
far
cry
from
the
statute
we
have
here,
which
deals
with
an
intent
to
extinguish
a
valid
property
right
interest,
only
because
the
state
determines
that
they
think
it
could
be
better
developed
by
somebody
else.
if
you
start
with
the
premise
that
you're
dealing
with
a
vested
property
right,
and
if
you
say
that
this
statute
is
intended
to
extinguish
that
right,...
and
throughout
you
will
see
that
that
is
shown
to
be
the
intent
of
the
statute,
to
extinguish
that
right.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
to
these--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--following
notice.
that's
correct.
if
he
defaults
following
notice...
and
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
statute
if
there
was
a
notice
provision
involved
with
the
statute.
it
is
the
lack
of--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
in
the
first
place,
this
statute
is
very
unique.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
any
statute
of
limitations...
for
example,
if
a
statute
of
limitations
were
passed
saying
that
all
actions
for
personal
injury
must
be
filed
within
one
year,
let's
say.
and
prior
to
that
it
had
been
two
years.
and
that
would
apply
to
existing
causes
of
action.
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
that
interest,
because
you
cannot,
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
eliminate
the
interest.
that
would
be--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--that's
correct.
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
indiana
specifically
in
this
case
has
said
that
this
statute
eliminates
the
right.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
underlying
right
or
rights.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
i'm
talking
about
all
of
the
rights.
there
are
no
rights
left
after
this
statute
has
done
its
job
that
it
sets
out--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--it
results
in
what
the
statute
calls
an
extinguishment
of
title.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
yes,
and
that's
the
point
because
it
isn't
an
extinguishment
of
title,
the
title
doesn't
go
away,
the
interest
in
the
minerals
don't
go
away.
they
are
transferred
by
virtue
of
the
act
from
one
party
to
another,
as
part
of
the
stated
purpose
of
the
act.
now,
we
think
that
if
the
stated
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
extinguish--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--we
do
not
say
it's
at
all--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--it
goes
far
beyond
that.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
don't
think
it
was...
was
it
ruled
on
by
this
court?
mr.
john
l.
carroll
but
not
on
a
constitutional
issue
that
had
been
brought
before
this
court,
so
i'm
not
able
to
answer
that
particular
question,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
if
the
state
changed
its...
you
see,
the
problem
is
that
there
was
no
adverse
possession
law
possible
in
mineral
interests
in
the
state
of
indiana
prior
to
this
act.
there's
probably
none
today.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
if
the
state
would
change
its
adverse
possession
law
and
attempt
to
do
it
retroactively
and
say
that
all
things
in
which
there
had
been
adverse
possession
for
10
years
and
20
years,
if
the
effect
of
that
act
was
to,
as
of
the
time
of
its
passage,
eliminate
titles,
then
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
would
be
an
improper
act
and
would
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
if
that
ten
years
has
already
run,
and
prior
to
that
it
was
20
years,
then
i
think
there
are
cases
that
clearly
say
that
that's
an
unconstitutional
taking;
that
you
cannot
change
a
statute
of
limitations
so
as
to,
by
the
very
passage,
eliminate
rights
already
accruing.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
but
it
has
a
time
limit
built
within
it.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
state
can
indeed
change--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--yes,
it
can
change
it
to
ten.
the
question
is
can
it
do
it
retroactively.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
point
i'm
making,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
that
if
they
change
it
to
ten
and
it
had--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--all
i'm
saying
is
the
statute
cannot
be
used
retroactively--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--i'm
not
talking
about
notice;
i'm
talking
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
retroactive
effect
on
the
statute
of
limitations
or
adverse
possession.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
yes,
indeed.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
if
everybody
had
notice
of
the
act
in
the
manner
that
you
prescribed,
in
my
judgment
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
i
understand
the
general
principle
of
jurisprudence
about
how
everybody
is
presumed
to
know
the
law,
how
ignorance
to
the
law
is
no
excuse--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--the
case
rests
on
the
fact
that
that's
a
legal
fiction.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
true,
but
if
you're
trying
to
deal
with
a
due
process
issue,
and
if
you're
trying
to
deal
with
a
property
which
is
about
to
be
extinguished--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--you
have
a
two
year
grace
period,
which
is
meaningless--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--that's
correct.
and
if
you
have
notice
of
that
duty,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
this
statute.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
right.
that's
exactly
what
the
minnesota
case
was--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--what
the
minnesota
case
said
was
not
constitutional.
in
indiana,
the
very
act
we're
dealing
with
here,
the
manner
of
notice
by
publication
of
the
act
is
by
merely
printing
the
act
and
putting
it
in
the
clerk's
offices
of
the
various
counties.
that's
the
only
notice
that
there
is.
now,
is
that...
the
question
that
really,
i
believe,
is
before
this
court
for
decision
as
we
see
it
is,
is
that
notice
sufficient
to
comport
with
the
mullane
decision
on
procedural
due
process.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
they
may
indeed
be
taxes
separately.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
not
very
regularly.
in
some
counties
yes,
in
other
counties
no.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
is
up
to
the
county.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
does.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
no,
sir,
these
were
not
taxed
by
the
county.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
no,
because
an
exception
within
the
use
rule
relates
to
the
payment
of
taxes,
but
they
were
not
taxed.
and
along
that
same
line,
justice
powell,
if
it
were
taxed,
and
in
order
to
transfer
a
title
because
of
non
payment
of
tax
there
is
still
a
notice
requirement,--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--yes.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
well,
i
think
the
matter
of
taxation
of
mineral
interest
is
one
way
to
solve
the
problem
that
indiana
feels
that
it
has.
if
these
mineral
interests
were
taxed
in
the
way
in
which
other
real
properties
were
taxed,
and
if
they
didn't
pay
the
tax
the
property
could
be
sold
at
tax
sale
like
any
other
property,
and
that's
perfectly
legitimate,
there's
no
problem
with
that.
nothing
constitutional
about
that.
but
under
indiana
law,
as
in
virginia
law
and
most
other
state
law,
when
you
sell
property
at
tax
sale,
the
man
is
entitled
to
notice
that
his
property
is
about
to
be
sold
at
tax
sale,
with
the
right
to
redeem.
and
there
wasn't
any
such
notice
here
and
there
wasn't
any
such
right
to
redeem
following
the
two
year
grace
period.
so
i
think
it's
distinctly
different
from
the
way
in
which
taxes
can
be
treated,
but
taxation
is
the
way
to
deal
with
these
old
dormant
mineral
interests,
because
if
the
people
are
interested
in
them,
they
will
pay
the
tax,
they
will
keep
it
up.
if
they're
not
interested
in
them,
they
avoid
the
tax,
it
is
sold
at
tax
sale
and
the
problem
is
solved.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
yes,
and
i
would
like
the
opportunity,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
to
do
that
by
showing
to
you
that
here,
by
virtue
of
the
act,
just
looking
at
what
effect
the
act
had,
it
did
indeed
have
the
effect
of
taking
what
prior
to
the
act
was
a
fee
simple
mineral
interest
entitled
under
the
indiana
state
cases
to
the
firmest
protection
of
the
constitution.
two
years
later,
after
the
passage
of
that
act
for
those
that
did
not
know
that
they
had
an
obligation
to
record,
they
were
left
with
nothing
unless
they
happened
to
have
ten
or
more
interests,
in
which
they
event
they
had
a
right
to
protect
themselves
by
notice
under
certain
circumstances
if
they
otherwise
qualified.
so--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--justice
o'connor,
the
difference
between
this
and
the
marketable
titles
act,
for
example,
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
marketable
titles
act
is
to
clear
up
appendages
to
titles
that
go
back,
in
the
case
of
indiana,
50
years.
and
there,
you
must
have
a
50-year
chain
of
clear
title.
at
the
end
of
that
50-year
period
if
you
had
50
years
chain
of
clear
title,
then
the
law
under
the
marketable
titles
act
says
we
will
confirm
what
you've
always
claimed
in
that
50
years
to
have.
the
man
in
possession
gets
no
more
than
what
he
has,
in
fact,
claimed
for
the
last
50
years.
in
one
sense,
marketable
title
acts
are
like
adverse
possession
on
the
record.
on
the
record
you've
been
claiming
these
interests
for
50
years.
if
you
do
so
and
the
record
is
clear,
at
the
end
of
that
time,
the
law
says,
we're
going
to
get
rid
of
those
old
claims
and
you
have
a
perfected
title.
on
the
dormant
mineral
interest
statute,
however...
in
this
case,
for
example,
mrs.
short
who
acquired
this
property
in
1974
had
her
property
deed
to
her
specifically
setting
forth
these
mineral
interests.
now,
that
would
not
qualify
for
marketable
title
because
she
didn't
have
a
chain
going
back
50
years
back
to
remanence
of
title
that
didn't
show
these
interests.
so
what
mrs.
short
ends
up
by
virtue
of
this
statute
in
having
a
title
in
more
than
she
acquired
when
she
purchased
the
property.
in
marketable
titles
you
only
get
what
you've
been
claiming
and
no
more.
so
here,
what
you've
done
is
to
enhance
the
title
that
the
man
had
and
you
do
it
within
a
two
year
period.
and
i
think
that's
a
basic
distinction
between
marketable
titles
and
the
effect
of
this
act.
again,
though,
if...
i
want
to
recur
back
to
the
purpose
of
the
indiana
legislature
in
passing
the
act,
because
throughout
the
briefs
and
the--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--right.
first,
we
say
that
the
passage
of
the
act
itself
is
not
a
due
process
notice
that
in
any
way
satisfies
the
mullane
test.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
not
at
all.
this
court
now
has
not
passed
on
the
marketable
titles
act.
wisconsin,
or
minnesota
has
passed
on
the
marketable
titles
act
constitutionally
and
found
them
to
be
constitutional;
whereas,
they
have
found
this
act
to
be
unconstitutional
and
have
distinguished
between
the
two
acts
and
found
them
to
be
basically
different.
and
the
procedural
due
process
question
goes
to
the
issue
of
what
the
state
is
attempting
to
achieve.
marketable
titles
has
a
benign
purpose
in
terms
of
protecting
old
titles.
this
has
a
stated
state
policy
of
extinguishing
these
interests.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
i
think
that's
true,
you're
correct
in
that
statement,
justice
rehnquist.
from
that
standpoint,
except
that
it
explains
why
there
wasn't
any
notice
provision
in
this
statute
that
you
would
normally
expect
to
find
when
you're
going
to
extinguish
rights.
for
example,
if
a
taxing
statute
was
passed
saying
that
if
you
don't
pay
your
taxes
when
they
are
due
on
the
date
they
are
due,
there's
an
automatic
forfeiture
of
rights
under
that
taxing
statute.
now,
in
terms
of
expectations
of
people
owning
property,
that
goes
beyond
any
expectation
of
the
property
owner.
so
also
here,
in
terms
of
the
expectation
of
a
fee
simple
title
holder,
he
has
no
reason
to
believe
that
in
a
two
year
period
for
failure
to
register
that
his
failure
to
do
so
is
going
to
extinguish
his
property
right.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
no,
indeed,
i
do
not.
i
think
here,
however,
where
you're
talking
about
extinguishment
and
you're
talking
about
adoption
of
an
act,
and
you
give
no
notice
other
than
the
adoption
of
the
act,
and
we
all
recognize
that
the
adoption
of
the
act
is
not,
in
fact,
notice.
you
see,
the
act
has
to
premise
itself
on
a
theory
of
abandonment.
an
abandonment
is
generally
intended
to
be
an
intentional
act.
and
if
we
get
notice--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--as
it
relates
to
real
estate,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
you
cannot
abandon
real
estate
in
most
of
the
states...
california
i
think
has
an
exception
to
that.
in
most
of
the
states
and
certainly
in
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
if
your
title
is
of
record
and
the
fact
that
you
let
the
weeds
grow--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--that,
of
course,
is
a
different
issue
if
there
is
an
adverse
possessor.
but
we're
talking
about
abandonment
which
is
independent
of
anybody
else
coming
in
on
top
of
your
property.
they're
proceeding
on
an
abandonment
theory
here,
the
theory
is
that
if
they
didn't
record
their
interest
in
the
two
year
period
they
intended
not
to
be
bothered
with
it,
or
they
weren't
around
to
protect
it.
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
appellants
here
were
living
in
the
area
or
known
in
each
instance
when
there
was
a
60-day
notice
provision
given
under
the
statute,
and
within
that
60-day
period
in
each
instance,
the
appellants
in
this
case
did
respond,
did
put
their
interest
of
record
in
the
case
of
short
v.
texaco
and
did
contact
the
surface
owner
in
the
pond
v.
walden
case,
which
resulted
in
an
agreed
case
to
be
filed
testing
the
act.
but
all
of
that
was
after
the
time
that
the
two
years
had
expired,
beyond
the
time
of
the
act.
but
the
point
is
that
there
was
no
intent
to
abandon,
and
they
responded
as
soon
as
they
knew.
but
absent
that
notice
that
is
directed
toward
the
individual,
we
submit
that
that
that
does
not
comply
or
comport
with
the
general
sense
of
fairness
that
we
think
is
necessary
under
the
mullane
case
and
is
procedural
due
process.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
statute
provides
for
it,
yes.
it's
not
uniform.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
think
they're
probably
not
very
selective,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
in
some
counties
they
do
and
some
tracts
they
do.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i'm
sure
that
there
are
counties
that
do
not.
i
don't
have--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--that
may
very
well
be
the
answer.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
but
taxation,
as
is
true
in
minnesota,
is
the
way...
what
they
have
done
in
minnesota...
it
was
held
unconstitutional
in
contos
again
because
of
the
lack
of
notice,
and
it's
a
very
similar
statute
to
here,
and
there
they
even
had
publication
of
notice
statewide
and
in
the
counties.
here
we
have
no
notice.
contos
in
minnesota
had
notice
by
publication.
they
said
that
doesn't
comply
with
mullane;
that
you
must
have
the
best
possible
or
practical
notice
that
is
available
to
be
given.
but
in
the
minnesota
case
in
statute,
he
went
on
to
say
that
in
effect,
if
you
give
the
notice
and
if
you
register
the
interest,
then
it's
there
to
be
taxed.
and
they
set
forth
a
special
mineral
interest
tax.
and
if
you
don't
pay
the
tax,
you're
going
to
lose
the
interest.
and
that
is
a
perfectly
constitutional
way
to
solve
this
problem.
but
to
say
that
you've
got
a
right
to
come
in
and
give
a
two
year
grace
period
and
give
no
one
notice
of
that
two
year
grace
period
that's
going
to
severely
impact
on
his
property.
now,
and
we
get
down
to
practicalities,
i'm
sure,
if
what
we're
talking
about
what
the
imposition
of
a
tax,
and
it's
a
matter
of
a
few
dollars,
then
i
don't
think
that
the
notice
is
going
to
be
required.
but
where
the
remedy
is
extinguishment...
and
i
guess
that
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
we're
saying...
where
the
remedy
is
extinguishment
within
a
two
year
period,
then
justice
and
fair
play
would
insist
that
there
be
notice
before
that
extinguishment
take
place.
otherwise,
we
do
not
think
that
there
has
been
fair
play
and
that
there
has
been
compliance
with
the
procedural
due
process--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--yes.
i
would
like
to
just
address
the
taking
question
by
making
reference
to
the
mahon
case
which
this
court
in
most
of
the...
not
most
of
your
decisions...
in
many
of
the
decisions
in
recent
years
has
reaffirmed
the
reasoning
in
the
mahon
case
and
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
mahon
case.
in
that
instance,
there
was
declared
a
taking
because
they
could
not
take
out
all
the
subsurface
coal,
they
would
not
let
them
allow
subsidence.
they
didn't
take
all
of
the
rights;
they
took
part
of
the
rights,
and
yet
they
said
there
was
a
taking,
even
though
the
benefit
of
the
taking
accrued
to
the
surface
owner.
and
that's
what
accrues
here.
the
taking,
they
argue,
is
not
a
taking
because
the
benefit
goes
to
the
surface
owner.
and
yet
mahon
is
directly
in
point
on
the
issue
that
you
can
still
have
a
taking,
even
if
the
benefit
is
to
the
surface
owner.
so
we
think
that
the
mahon
case
and
the
later
cases
clearly
show
a
taking
assuming
that
there
is
no
valid
notice
that
would
be
required
under
procedural
due
process.
these
two
are
so
intertwined
that
the
taking
occurs
and
it
occurs
primarily
because
the
failure
to
have
a
procedural
due
process
requirement.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
think
there's
an
apt
analogy,
justice
white,
to
what
we're
talking
about
here.
where
you're
dealing
with
specific
property
and
you're
going
to
put
either
a
burden
on
that
property
of
the
kind
we're
talking
about,
then
i
am
suggesting
that
notice
is
a
prerequisite
before
the
law
enforces--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--if
there
is
notice
and
if
you
had
the
opportunity
to
protect
yourself--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--and
you
don't,
then
i
do
not
think
there's
a
taking.
thank
you.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
two
more
comments,
if
i
may.
one
is
we
somehow
have
put
this
case
based
upon
expediency,
and
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
make...
should
not
make
constitutional
judgments
about
what
is
expedient
on
the
matter
of
whether
we're
going
to
give
notice.
counsel
has
said
that
the
act
is
going
to
determine
who
is
known
and
who
is
unknown
as
an
owner.
i
submit
that
section
6
of
the
act
is
an
answer
to
the
questions
which
are
raised,
because
it
will
clarify
and
protect
your
recording
statute,
which
he
says
this
is;
it
will
put
on
the
record
those
that
are
known
or
unknown;
and
if
you
read
section
6,
it
is
a
perfect
answer
to
procedural
due
process.
the
only
problem
with
section
6
is
it
only
applies
if
you
have
ten
or
more
interests.
had
it
applied
to
all
of
the
interests,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
this
is
a
statute
which,
by
its
nature,
does
not
treat
people
who
have
less
than
ten
interests
fairly.
it
was
designed
to
terminate
their
interest.
but
if
you
look
at
section
6
you
have
a
perfect
answer
to
how
it
should
have
been
done
on
a
constitutional
basis
and
protect
everybody,
be
they
rich,
the
poor,
the
large,
the
small
owner,
put
the
interests
of
record.
because
if
they
don't
come
forward
after
the
notice,
then
you
can
assume
the
surface
owner
is
the
owner.
if
they
do
come
forward,
then
they
have
their
interest
of
record.
the
statute
does
not
do
that,
and
it
does
not
do
that
because
its
intent
is
to
extinguish
that
interest.
thank
you.
