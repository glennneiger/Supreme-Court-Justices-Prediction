justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
argued
last
session
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it's
not
a
case
that
lands
to
easy
description
but
it
seems
to
be
fairly
important
in
the
transportation
industry.
it
centers
in
the
use
of
uniforms
straight
bills
of
lading
prescribed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
in
these
bills
contained
a
provision
that
the
shipper
is
liable
for
freight
charges
unless
it
signs
a
nonrecourse
clause
contained
in
the
bill
of
lading.
in
this
case,
the
cause
was
not
signed
and
three
shipments
were
delivered
by
the
railroad
to
the
consignee
without
the
collection
of
freight
charges.
the
issue
was
whether
when
the
railroad
seeks
payment
of
these
charges
from
the
shipper,
the
latter
may
defeat
the
railroad's
claim
with
an
equitable
defense
by
showing
that
the
carrier
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
credit
regulations.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
such
a
defense
could
be
asserted
and
in
this
case
was
valid.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
unanimously
hold
that
that
ruling
was
error
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
violation
of
a
credit
regulations
does
not
bar
the
railroad's
collections
of
lawful
freight
charges
from
a
shipper
who
has
not
signed
the
nonrecourse
clause
in
the
bill
of
lading.
