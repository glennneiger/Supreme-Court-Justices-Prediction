unknown
speaker
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts,
mr.
pipkin.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
consignor
was
paid
for
the
goods?
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
is.
i
missed
it.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pipkin,
let
me
interrupt
you
a
little
bit.
what
is
the
percentage
of
consignors
that
sign
that
annotation?
unknown
speaker
i
couldn't
hear
justice
stevens's
question
and
i
may
be
repeating,
but
what
is
the
status...
does
the
record
show
the
status
of
the
southern
pacific's
suit
against
carco?
unknown
speaker
were
the
goods
ever
paid
for?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
practical
effect
of
the
non-recourse
clause?
what
incentive
does
the
consignor
have
not
to
sign
it?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
any
views
of
the
icc
in
this
case,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry,
mr.
pipkin,
would
you
tell
me
again
the
name
of
that
case,
the
icc--
unknown
speaker
--have
you
cited
it?
unknown
speaker
don't
bother,
i
will
get
it.
thank
you.
and
they
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
and
the
icc
agrees
with
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pipkin,
does
the
record
in
this
case
disclose
whether
the
carrier
made
any
credit
inquiry
of
any
nature
in
this
instance?
unknown
speaker
we
should
judge
the
case
on
the
basis
that
the
company
needn't...
you
are
suggesting
that
there
need
be
no
investigation.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
are
suggesting
that
to
come
out
where
you
want
to
come
out,
there
needn't
be
any
investigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
suggesting
that
we
construe
the
statute
that
way.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
the
regulation
construes
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
and
so
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
the
agent
or
the
railroad
deliberately
didn't
make
an
investigation.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
there
was,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pipkin,
may
i
ask
another
question,
just
looking
at
the
cfg
case
that
you
rely
heavily
on.
that
appears
to
be
an
under-charge
case
rather
than
a
non-payment
case,
isn't
it?
and
would
that
necessarily
then
have
the
same
rule
as
one
involving...
whether
a
credit
violation
excuses
payment
of
the
full
charge.
i
am
not
saying
that
you
are
necessarily
wrong,
but
i
am
just
not
sure
that
i
understand
why
that
case--
unknown
speaker
--but
then
the
agency
goes
on
to
say
it
is
a
question
to
be
determined
by
the
courts
and
not
by
the
commission
in
the
collection
situation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sudbury,
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question
on
this.
how
did
their
discount
hurt
your
client?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
they
had
checked
it
out
and
said
we
find
you
are
a
bad
credit
risk;
we
are
not
going
to
deliver
the
goods.
and
they
called
your
client
up
and
said
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
what
would
you
have
said?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
have
been
liable
for
the
freight
charges.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
have
had
the
goods
back,
but
instead
of
the
goods
you
have
got
payment
for
the
goods.
so
how
does
it...
i
don't
understand
how
you
are
that
badly
hurt.
unknown
speaker
if
you
weren't
paid
for
the
goods,
i
would
understand.
but
you
were
paid.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
i
still
don't
quite
understand
how
you
are
hurt
because
had
you
been
advised
of
the
situation,
you
could
have
gotten
the
goods
back,
but
you
still
would
have
had
to
pay
the
freight.
i
don't
know
how
much
these
goods
are
worth,
i
don't
have
any
idea,
but
i
wonder
if
you
would
have
been...
if
you
were
put
to
the
elections
of
either
taking
money
for
the
goods
or
saying
keep
the
goods
and
ship
them
back,
what
you
would
have
done.
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
record
tell
us
when
you
were
paid?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
stipulation
of
facts
really
don't
refer
to
what
an
acceptable
credit
inquiry
by
the
carrier
would
have
disclosed.
and
it
just
would
seem
to
me
that
the
record
might
have
indicated
whether
the
information,
if
disclosed,
would
have
been
acceptable
by
industry
standards.
there
just
isn't
anything
here,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
and
the
stipulation
does
not
appear
to
cover
the
further
inquiry
of
what
it
would
have
disclosed
had
an
inquiry
been
made.
unknown
speaker
what
evidence
do
you
have,
counsel,
that
the
legislative
body,
the
congress,
was
concerned
about
protection
of
the
consignee,
the
shipper,
in
enacting
section
3.2.
the
evidence
that
we
have
examined
would
indicate
that
the
concern
of
congress
was
with
the
protection
of
the
carriers,
not
the
shipper.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
the
preamble
to
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
isn't
it,
which
had
a
lot
of
provisions
in
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
true,
but
do
you
have
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
that
provision
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
the
shipper?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sudbury,
i
take
it
that
in
light
of
this
discussion
you
have
just
been
having
with
justice
o'connor,
that
you
agree
that
this
case
is
to
be
decided
in
light
of
the
act
and
the
regulations;
this
is
not
a
common
law
suit.
unknown
speaker
even
inspite
of
the
failure
to
sign
the
non-recourse
clause?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
sudbury,
is
the
non-recourse
clause
or
the
opportunity
to
sign
one,
is
that
a
matter
of
voluntary
agreement
or
is
that
somehow
required
by
law?
unknown
speaker
so
some
of
them...
bills
of
lading
do
not
include
it,
then,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
to
have
it
on
it,
what,
is
just
a
matter
of
railroad
practice
or
custom
or
something?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
say
it
has
in
it
because
some
law
requires
it.
unknown
speaker
and
the
form
promulgated
by
icc
includes?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
wonder
could
either
a
rail
carrier
or
a
consignor
insist
on
its
deletion
before
the
transaction
of
shipment
is
completed?
unknown
speaker
signed.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
consignee
could
depend
on
the
same
grounds
that
you
are
depending
on?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
enough
just
to
have
a
bare
violation
of
the
statute
and
regulation.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
one
sense,
your
client,
the
consignor,
selected
the
consignee,
and
your
argument
imposes
this
pre-selected
consignee
on
the
carrier,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
a
bit,
mr.
sudbury.
suppose
the
railroad
had
said
to
the
consignee,
cash
on
the
line
or
no
delivery.
then
they
would
have
to...
i
don't
know
whether
this
would
have
involved
a
lot
of
demurrage,
but
at
any
rate,
they
would
have
had
to,
in
effect,
impound
the
entire
shipment,
wouldn't
they,
until
paid?
unknown
speaker
now,
who
then
would
be
liable?
unknown
speaker
for
the
demurrage
and
the
freight
charges.
unknown
speaker
in
what
respects
are
you
worse
off
as
a
result
of
the
delivery?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
worse
off
by
the
amount
of
the
freight,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what
you
are
objecting
to
is
that
there
is
a
claim
for
freight
charges
against
you.
unknown
speaker
and
you
had...
they
already
had
their
money.
and
if
the
railroad
had
investigated
and
not
delivered
the
goods,
you
would
have
had
the
goods,
too.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
would
have
had
to
pay
the
freight
charges
that
the
consignee
should
have
paid,
you
could
have
taken
it
out
of
their
money.
unknown
speaker
you
couldn't
keep
all
their
money
and
the
goods,
too,
i
wouldn't
think.
you
would
only
have
to
give
back
the
money
that...
the
balance
after
you
collected
the
freight
charges.
unknown
speaker
so
you
had
the
money
already.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
could
have
gotten
the
goods
back,
too,
you
could
easily
have
paid
the
freight
charges.
unknown
speaker
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
pass
on
that
contention,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
saying
well,
the
railroad's
conduct
didn't
release
us
from
our
liability,
it
just
damaged
us.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
failure
just
released
the
consignor
from
liability,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
it
did
you
any
damage,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
breach
is
admitted,
the
breach
is
admitted,
but
you
insist
that
ipso
facto,
as
soon
as
there
is
a
breach,
you
are
released.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
holding
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
so.
maybe
they
breached
the
contract,
but
that
is
a
different
argument
than
you
are
released
from
liability
just
by
the
breach.
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
different
argument?
and
it
is
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
have
given
you
a
right
to
say
you
have
been
hurt
and
you
should
have
a
counterclaim.
but
that
is
different,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know
the
court
didn't
hold
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
what
you...
that
is
a
different
argument
than
saying
that
you
are
released.
unknown
speaker
i
know
what
it
held,
but
that
is
just
saying
that
the
railroad's
conduct
just
released
you.
i
think
the
court,
the
fifth
circuit,
has
followed
other
courts
which
have
recognized
these
equitable
defenses,
your
honor,
specifically
in
the
admiral
case,
the
case
decided
in
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
there
went
on
to
say
that
under
the
facts
in
that
circumstance
that
the
plaintiff,
the
carrier,
had
created
the
risk
of
loss
by
its
credit
practices.
it
said
it
contributed
to
the
gravity
of
the
loss
by
allowing,
in
this
case,
the
consignee's
unsatisfied
debts
to
accumulate
beyond
a
lawful
and
reasonable
time
for
credit.
under
these
circumstances,
we
find
no
difficulty
in
holding
the
plaintiff
estopped
to
collect
payment
of
the
freight
charges
from
the
defendant.
mr.
sudbury,
as
you
correctly
pointed
out,
that
is,
of
course,
a
consignee
case
where
the
consignee
would
have,
in
effect,
paid
double
if
it
was
held
liable.
are
there
any
cases
like
this
one
where
the
consignor
has
been
excused
from
his
liability?
there
are
a
whole
line
of
them,
i
know,
on
the
double-payment
situation.
unknown
speaker
which
case
was
that,
again?
