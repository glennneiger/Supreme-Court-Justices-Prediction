mr.
david
h.
sudbury
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
southern
pacific,
having
admittedly
engaged
in
illegal,
negligent
and
inequitable
conduct
today
comes
before
this
court
seeking
to
transfer
the
very
fruit
of
that
action
to
an
innocent
consignor.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act,
specifically,
section
3.2
entitled
payment
of
freight
as
a
prerequisite
to
delivery,
prohibits
a
railroad
from
delivering
any
freight
shipped
by
it
until
all
charges
have
been
paid,
except
under
express
circumstances
promulgated
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
applicable
regulations
which
counsel
has
conceded
have
been
violated,
at
least
with
regard
to
the
first
shipment
are
located
in
49
cfr
1320.1,
and
they
provide
that
a
railroad
may
extend,
only
for
a
very
limited
number
of
days,
credit
under
certain
circumstances,
provided
that
it
takes
precautions
to
ensure
timely
payment
of
charges.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
justice
stevens,
the
failure
of
the
railroad,
in
this
case,
to
take
any
precaution
with
regard
to
any
credit
check
whatsoever
of
the
consignee...
admittedly,
the
consignee
was
not
a
credit
patron
of
the
railroad,
had
never
applied
for
credit
and
had
never
been
given
credit.
the
decision
to
extend
credit
to
the
consignee
was
a
pure
act
of
voluntarism
on
the
part
of
the
railroad.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
at
that
point
in
time,
your
honor,
our
worst
expectations
would
have
been
to
have
had
possession...
or
at
least,
to
have
control
of
the
material
that
was
in
a
yard
in
california,
had
not
been
released
to
the
consignee.
once
it
went
to
the
consignee,
the
party
that
had
written
hot
checks
here
and
didn't
pay
the--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--under
section
7,
that
is
right,
your
honor,
we
would--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--the
shipment--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--the
sale
was
made
for
detroit.
what
we
received
was
the
for
purchase
price,
free
onboard
the
rail
carrier
in
detroit.
we
were
not
paid
in
this
case
for
the
freight
charges
to
california.
that
is
why
the
bill
of
lading
was,
as
the
railroad
has
admitted,
freight
collect.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
well,
the
goods
were
approximately
$46,000.
the
freight
charges
obviously
are
$14,000.
i
think
that
is
in
the
record
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
hillman.
the
point
is,
though,
that
the
control
of
the
goods,
once
they
were
let
out
of
the
railroad's
hand
without
any
credit
precautions
whatsoever,
they
gave
us
no
choice.
we
never
got
to
that
stage.
the
railroad
never
contacted
us.
it
was
strictly
in
the
railroad's
dominion
to
determine
whether
they
were
going
to
release
the
goods,
and
when
they
did
so,
in
fact,
they
didn't
contact
us
for
two
years
and
seven
months
later
to
tell
us
that
it
had
not
been
paid
for.
by
that
time,
the
record
shows,
the
railroad's
attempts
to
even
locate
the
consignee
were
impossible.
had
they
contacted
us,
we
were
in
touch
with
the
consignee,
we
could
have
perhaps
applied
some
pressure
to
make
sure
the
goods
were
paid
for.
and
i
think
even
more
specifically,
to
answer
your
question,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
facts
involved
in
the
dates
of
these
shipments.
the
first
shipment
left
detroit
on
april
11,
1974.
that
shipment
arrived
and
was
released,
admittedly
without
any
credit
check,
to
the
consignee
on
april
25,
1974.
we
didn't
even
ship
the
last
two
cars,
the
rail
cars,
they
didn't
leave
detroit
until
may
2nd,
sometime
after
the
consignee
had
the
first
car
already
in
his
possession.
specifically
to
answer
your
question,
we
certainly
would
not
have
shipped
the
second
two
if
we
knew
there
was
any
problem
with
the
first.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
by
the
consignee?
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
the
payment
for
the
goods
was
made
prior
to
shipment.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
there
is
nothing,
your
honor,
because,
of
course,
there
was
no
credit
inquiry
made.
the
stipulation
says
that
carco
had
never
even
applied
for
credit.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
it
does
not.
the
facts
are
that
the
consignee
never
paid
for
the
first
shipment,
and
the
fact
is
that
the
rail...
the
freight
charge
was
some
two
weeks
past
due
when
the
second
cars
arrived,
and
the
fact
is
that
the
railroad
released
the
second
two
cars;
one
by
an
extension
of
further
credit
when
they
took
a
check
for
less
than
the
full
amount
of
the
freight
charge,
and
both
those
checks
were
shortly
returned
by
the
consignee's
bank
marked
insufficient
funds.
from
there,
the
railroad
was
not
able
to
find
the
consignee.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
the
purpose
of
the
act,
as
set
forth
in
the
preamble,
is
to
promote
the
orderly
and
efficient
transportation
policy
throughout
the
united
states.
specifically,
it
refers
to
encouraging
sound
economic
conditions
in
transportation
throughout
the
united
states.
certainly,--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--that
is
correct.
the
railroad's
position
that
the
shipper,
or
that
the
consignor
in
this
case,
is
not
protected
by
any
legislative
history
simply
defies
the
realities
of
the
transportation
shipment.
the
fact
is
that
the
railroad
released
these
goods,
extended
the
credit
on
its
own
volition.
they
improperly
and
in
violation
of
not
only
the
regulations
but
the
law...
the
law
says
in
section
3.2
that
no
carrier
by
railroad
and
no
express
company
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
deliver
or
relinquish
possession
at
destination
of
any
freight
transported
by
it
until
all
tariff
charges
have
been
paid,
except
under
such
conditions
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
may
from
time
to
time
prescribe.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
under
the
railroad's
argument,
justice
o'connor,
the
legislative
history
was
directed
solely
toward
increasing
the
cash
floe
of
the
railroad.
certainly,
the
extension
of
credit
on
their
part
here
was
an
act
which
they
voluntarily
undertook
that
hurt
or
certainly
handicapped
that
cash
floe
in
this
case.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
no,
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
act
specifically
states
that...
in
its
savings
clause...
that
it
was
not
designed
or
intended
to
eliminate
any
remedies
that
were
available
at
the
common
law.
specifically,...
in
fact,
an
argument
which
i
will
get
to
in
just
a
minute
is
that
in
addition
to
a
violation
of
the
regulations,
this
was
a
violation
of
the
express
contract
between
the
parties.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
non-recourse
clause
is
a
means
by
which
a
consignor
can
relieve
itself
absolutely
of
any
liability,
as
a
matter
of
contract.
the
failure
to
sign
it
does
not
ipso
facto
mean
that
the
consignor
should
not
have
available
to
it
certain
equitable
defenses,
as
the
fifth
circuit
recognized
in
this
case.
that
is
really
the
thrust
of
the
railroad's
position.
our
position
is
that
the
option
to
sign
the
non-recourse
part
of
section
7
is
just
that;
it
is
a
contract
option.
it
doesn't
preclude
any
other
remedies
available
at
common
law
to
a
party
to
the
contract.
the
simple
fact
in
this
case
is
that
had
the
southern
pacific
observed
these
relatively
simple
but
mandatory
rules,
this
loss
would
not
have
occurred.
i
referred
specifically
to
section
3.2
of
the
act
previously.
specifically,
the
commission,
in
promulgating
regulations
under
that
act,
has
said
that
the
carrier,
upon
taking
precautions
deemed
by
it
to
be
sufficient
to
assure
payment
of
the
tariff
charges
within
the
credit
period
specified
in
this
part,
may
relinquish
possession
of
the
freight.
the
fact
is
in
this
case,
admittedly,
they
took
absolutely
no
precautions.
by
regulation,
therefore,
the
commission
has
made
two
requirements
for
the
granting
of
credit,
and
these
are
pertinent
to
the
issues
under
consideration.
first,
the
railroad
must
take
precautions
at
least
to
some
degree
to
assure
itself
of
timely
payment
of
the
charges.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
no,
it
is
a
matter
of
voluntary
agreement,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
my
understanding
is
that
at
least
with
rail
carriers,
all
bills
of
lading
have
that
option
on
it.
whether
it
is
signed
or
executed
or
not
is
a
matter
of
contract--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--i
believe
the
form
of
the
bill
of
lading
has
it
on
it
in
practically
every
instance
i
have
ever
seen,
yes.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
the
commission
has
promulgated
a
form
of
bill
of
lading
for
rail
carriers;
it
has
not
done
so,
my
understanding,
is
for
motor
carriers.
the
rail
carriers
do
have--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--includes
this
clause
which
may
be
executed,
yes.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
well,
the
non-recourse
part
of
section
7
does
not
come
into
play
unless
it
is
specifically--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--affirmatively
signed
by
the
consignor.
in
this
case,
it
would
not
signed,
admittedly.
the
reasons
for
it
are
unknown.
but
the
point
is
that
in
not
signing
it,
that
was
not
a
violation
of
any
regulation,
a
violation
of
any
statute.
that
was
a
matter
of
contract
option,
either
through
foresight
or
for
whatever
the
reason,
it
was
not
signed.
and
we
have
admitted
that.
and
as
the
fifth
circuit,
that
makes
us
primarily
liable,
together
with
the
consignee
who
has
accepted
the
goods,
for
the
freight
charges.
however,
that
does
not
absolutely
mean
that
we
don't
have
the
right
to
raise
whatever
defenses
that
we
are
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
well,
our...
you
mean
had
it
not
paid
the
charges
and
been
sued?
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
absolutely
not.
our
standard,
as
it
has
been
referred
to,
our
test
that
it
would
seem
logical
to
apply
is
that
you
must
have
equity
on
your
side.
certainly
a
consignee
who
received
the
goods
who
had
not
paid
the
charges
is
not
going
to
be
heard
to
complain
that
it
is
not
required
to
pay
because
the
railroad
never
investigated
its
credit
worthiness.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
have
never
suggested
that.
in
fact,
as
the
railroad
has
pointed
out,
the
large
majority
of
the
violations
of
the
regulations
are
required
where
the
consignee
receives
freight
and
does
not
make
payment
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
we
selected
to
do
business
with
this
person
on
an
fob
detroit
basis,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
did
not
instruct
the
railroad...
in
fact,
to
the
contrary,
under
the
law
and
regulations,
we
expected
that
they
would
either
collect
the
charges
at
the
time
of
delivery
or
shortly
thereafter,
certainly
within
a
matter
of
days.
again,
we
were
not
even
notified
of
this
loss
for
over
31
months.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
railroad
mailed
its
bill
for
the
first
carload
on
april
25,
1974.
this
was
for
the
carload
that
was
released
without
any
credit
check
or
payment
whatsoever.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
for
the
demurrage?
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
the
courts
have
held
that
lawful
charges
include
not
only
the
freight
charges
but
also
the
demurrage
and
not
signing
section
7,
had
the
consignee
just
refused
the
shipment
for
some
reason,
gone
out
of
business
before
it
got
there,
we
would
have
been
liable,
the
consignor
would
have
been
liable
for
the
freight,
as
well
as
the
demurrage
charges.
that
is
a
risk
or
an
expectation
that
we
were
willing
to
assume
under
the
circumstances.
what
we
were
not
willing
to
assume
was
the
total
lack
of
any
credit
check
on
the
part
of
the
railroad,
and
then
the
unbridled
extension
of
credit
on
their
part,
coupled
with
their
action
in
not
coming
back
against
the
party
to
whom
they
now
claim
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
has
principal
liability
for
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
fact.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
we
have
no...
obviously
no
ability
to
go
back
against
the
consignee,
at
least
based
on
the
record
that
the
railroad
has
in
trying
to
locate
him.
we
have
had
no
more
success.
the
counsel
for
the
railroad
suggested
that
an
agent
may
have
released
this
because
he
was
down
the
street.
well,
he
is
down
the
street
from
the
railroad
in
alhambra,
california
and
not
at
our
office
in
detroit,
michigan.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
we
were
not
paid
the
freight
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
we
were
paid
for
the
goods
fob
detroit,--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
certainly.
as
i
was
saying,
the
railroad
mailed
its
bill
for
the
first
carloads
on
april
25,
1974.
giving
the
railroad
the
benefit
of
the
most
liberal
interpretation
of
the
regulations
dealing
with
when
it
was
due,
the
first
bill
was
already
two
weeks'
past
due
when
the
second
cars
arrived
and
were
released
by
the
railroad.
obviously,
the
last
two
cars
were
released
when
the
bill
was
blatantly
delinquent.
the
counsel
for
the
railroad
has
pointed
out
that
the
railroad
accepted
two
checks
for
the
last
two
cars,
one
of
which
is
inexplicably
in
an
amount
approximately
$900
short
of
the
proper
amount.
their
brief
refers
to
some
transposition
of
numbers,
but
still,
that
amounted
to
an
extension
of
credit
on
the
part
of
the
railroad.
they
have
also
asked
how
accepting
a
check
for
the
last
two,
or
two
checks
for
the
last
two
cars,
somehow
is
related
to
the
first
car.
well,
the
facts
is
at
that
point,
they
had
a
credit
history
with
carco
whom
they
had
never
dealt
with
before.
they
had
an
account
past
due
for
some
two
weeks
which
had
not
been
paid.
they
had
nothing
in
their
credit
file
from
a
customer
who
had
never
even
admittedly
applied
for
credit.
they
took
two
checks
that
subsequently
were
returned
to
the
bank
for
insufficient
funds.
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
states
that
southern
pacific
was
in
direct
violation
of
the
act
by
extending
credit
without
any
precaution
whatsoever
and
for
a
period
of
time
in
excess
of
the
period
required
in
the
regulations.
the
question
was
asked
earlier
about
whether
we
contend
this
is
a
violation
of
the
common
law.
we
do.
in
addition
to
the
violation
of
the
act,
the
railroad's
conduct
breached
the
contract
between
the
parties.
as
the
railroad
has
admitted
and
the
case
law
is
clear,
the
bill
of
lading
is
a
common
law
contract.
this
contract
expressly
provides
that
the
service
of
a
carrier
is
to
be
performed
in
accordance
with
the
conditions
listed
on
the
back
of
the
contract
terms
and
conditions,
on
the
back
of
that
document,
which
is
unfortunately
poorly
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix,
section
7.
it
is
at
pages
37
and
41,
although
illegible.
i
would
refer
you
to
page
1(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief
of
the
national
industrial
traffic
league
which
has
the
entire
document.
it
reads
that
the
owner
of
the
consignee
shall
pay
the
freight
and
average,
if
any,
and
all
other
lawful
charges
accruing
on
said
property.
but
except
in
those
instances
where
it
may
lawfully
be
authorized
to
do
so,
no
carrier
by
railroad
shall
deliver
or
relinquish
possession
at
destination
of
the
property
covered
by
this
bill
of
lading
until
all
tariff
rates
and
charges
on
it
have
been
paid.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
an
express
contract
between
the
parties
that
was
violated.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
they
did
not
get
to...
or
address
that
point.
in
that
regard,
southern
pacific
mistakenly
portrays
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
view
of
its
role
in
determining
the
liability
of
consignors
and
consignees
under
bills
of
lading.
specifically,
at
footnote
1,
page
2
of
the
southern
pacific's
reply
brief
on
the
merits,
it
implies
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
expanded
its
jurisdiction
to
include
interpretation
of
the
liability
of
parties
to
a
bill
of
lading
contract.
in
fact,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
cgf
grain
case,
as
was
mentioned
earlier,
specifically
has
reiterated
what
it
classifies
as
its
longstanding
position
that
the
question
of
a
contract
is
to
be
resolved...
or
the
question
of
liability
under
a
contract...
is
to
be
resolved
by
the
courts.
the
commission
said
that
the
question
of
complainant's
liability
does
not
turn
on
whether
any
provision
of
the
act
has
been
violated,
but
rather
is
governed
by
the
bill
of
lading
contract
between
the
parties,
and
it
must
be
decided
by
interpreting
that
contract.
for
this
reason,
it
is
a
question
to
be
determined
by
the
courts
and
not
this
commission.
this
conclusion
is
in
accordance
with
numerous
past
cases
in
which
the
commission
has
declined
to
decide
questions
of
liability
as
between
a
consignor
and
a
consignee.
in
reply
to
the...
this
position,
the
railroad
has
once
again
in
its
reply
brief
looked
to
a
purported
historical
analysis
to
attempt
to
portray
the
first
sentence
of
section
7
as
actually
two
clauses
somehow
combined
in
history
into
a
single
sentence.
the
fact
is
that
those
two
clauses
do
relate
to
the
consignee.
when
the
bill
of
lading
is
executed,
the
consignee
is
not
even
a
party
to
the
contract;
the
law
is
he
only
becomes
a
party
to
it
when
he
accepts
the
goods
upon
delivery.
such
a
convoluted
analysis
as
called
for
or
requested
by
the
railroad
is
not
required.
the
contract
obligation
is
clear,
and
that
obligation
was
breached,
in
addition
to
the
violation
of
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
southern
pacific,
although
establishing
a
prima
facie
case
of
primary
liability
on
the
part
of
commercial
metals,
nevertheless
permitted
commercial
metals
to
raise
an
equitable
defense
based
on
the
facts.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
right,
that
it
was
an
equitable
defense
which
could
be
raised
in
the
suit
for
the
charges.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
directly
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
were
damaged.
the
trial
court's
opinion
clearly
did;
it
referred
to
the
gross
negligence
of
the
railroad
which
resulted
in
the
loss.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
the
railroad--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--your
honor,
the
railroad
came
back
against
us
when
they,
apparently
two
and
a
half
years
later,
discovered
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
able
to
find
the
consignee.
the
damage--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--well,
our
position
is--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--it
gave
rise
to
our
right
to
assert
a
defense
to
the
claim
which
the
trial
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
recognized.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
a
counterclaim
against
the
carrier?
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
that
was
not
what
the
court
so
held.
we
have
not
presumed--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--well,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
remedies
available
as
equity
give
rise
to
equitable
defenses
which
would
recognize--
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
--the
atcon
case
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
railroad
is
a
case
exactly
on
point,
although
that
case
doesn't
even...
the
facts
in
that
case
don't
reveal
whether
or
not
there
was
an
initial
violation
of
the
law
and
regulations
based
on
the
unbridled
extension
of
credit
to
the
consignee
in
that
case.
all
it
says
is
that
the
carrier's
failure
to
come
back
against
the
consignor
within
the
time
period
set
forth
in
the
regulations
is
a
violation
of
the
credit
restrictions,
and
therefore,
a
defense
can
be
raised.
mr.
david
h.
sudbury
the
atcon
versus
brown...
brown
transportation
v.
atcon,
cited.
the
court
in
admiral
stated
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
fashion
a
sword
to
insure
collection
in
all
instance
and
to
shield
or
insulate
the
carrier
from
the
legal
consequences
of
its
otherwise
negligent
or
inequitable
conduct.
that
is
exactly
what
the
railroad
seeks
here.
the
court
continued
that
these
same
considerations
lead
us
to
reject
plaintiff's
claim
that
the
principles
of
equitable
estoppel
have
no
application
in
any
action
for
the
collection
of
freight
charges.
in
considering
the
carrier's
plea
for
equitable
relief
in
the
admiral
case,
the
court
said
that
it
would
not
blind
itself
to
the
plaintiff's
unlawful
conduct
in
violating
the
credit
regulations
as
enacted
by
the
commission.
in
that
case,
the
defendant
could
not
be
charged
as
a
matter
of
law
with
knowledge
of
the
preface.
in
our
case,
we
certainly
could
not
be
charged
with
the
knowledge
of
extension
of
credit
to
a
consignee
of
which
we
had
no
knowledge
for
some
two
and
one-half
years.
permitting
recovery
in
this
case
would
serve
only
to
reward
the
carrier
for
its
unlawful
as
well
as
inequitable
conduct.
we
decline
to
turn
the
motor
carrier
act's
equivalent
of
section
3.2
inside
out
to
achieve
that
result.
equitable
estoppel
or
equitable
defenses
have
been
recognize
in
other
cases
the
mason
&
dixon
lines
and
crossville
rubber
company,
the
atcon
case,
specifically
referred
to
previously,
allied
van
lines,
aero
mayflower,
all
cases
cited
in
the
briefs.
referring
to
a
previous
decision
of
this
court
in
a
case
in
which
equitable
estoppel
defense
was
allowed,
the
eighth
circuit
in
1972
in
the
southern
pacific
transportation
company
v.
campbell
soup
case
specifically
stated
that
we
think
it
is
equally
plain,
however,
that
this
court
in
the
fink
decision,
1919
case,
did
not
intend
to
impose
a
species
of
absolute
viability
upon
consignees
by
ruling
out
the
defense
estoppel
under
all
circumstances.
we
think
the
critical
question
in
this
case
is
whether
judicial
recognition
of
an
estoppel
defense
will
contravene
the
anti-discriminatory
purpose
of
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
found
that
that
anti-discriminatory
purpose
was
not
contravened.
we
received...
commercial
metals
received
no
windfall.
we
were
not
paid
for
any
freight
that
we
are
holding
and
refusing
to
pay
someone.
forcing
us
to
pay
the
carrier
in
this
case
would
not
benefit
anyone
except
the
carrier,
and
in
fact,
it
would
be
obviously
to
our
detriment.
the
trial
court
and
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
do
not
result
in
discrimination
against
any
competitor
of
the
shipper,
nor
did
it
discriminate
against
any
locale
or
geographic
region.
as
found
in
the
court
below,
the
party
guilty
of
granting
the
preference
in
this
case
was
the
southern
pacific.
to
turn
that
illegal
preference
against
cmc
is
illogical
and
not
required
by
law.
