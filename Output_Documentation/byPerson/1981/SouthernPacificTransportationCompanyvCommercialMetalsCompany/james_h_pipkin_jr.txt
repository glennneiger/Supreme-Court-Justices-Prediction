mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
petitioner,
southern
pacific
transportation
company,
a
railroad
common
carrier
involved
in
this
action.
in
essence,
the
action
is
an
effort
by
the
carrier
to
recover
from
the
shipper
or
consignor...
in
this
case,
respondent
commercial
metals
company...
freight
charges
incurred
in
transporting
three
separate
carload
shipments
of
steel
cobble,
which
is
a
form
of
scrap
steel,
from
detroit,
michigan
to
southern
california
back
in
1974.
the
dollar
amount
involved
in
these
movements
is
small;
it
is
less
than
$14,000
total.
the
legal
issue
presented
is
of
great
significance
to
the
nation's
railroads
and
motor
carriers.
it
is
whether
a
carrier's
right
to
recover
transportation
charges
from
a
consignor
can
be
barred
by
an
implied
remedy
based
on
a
violation
of
the
icc's
credit
regulations.
or
putting
it
another
way,
it
is
whether
an
equitable
defense
should
be
added
to
the
credit
regulations
as
an
enforcement
mechanism.
the
courts
below
found
that
the
carrier
violated
the
icc's
credit
regulations
with
respect
to
all
three
shipments
here
involved,
by
delivering
the
first
shipment
without
checking
the
credit
worthiness
of
the
consignee
and
by
accepting
checks
which
were
later
returned
for
insufficient
funds,
and
one
of
which
was
for
an
amount
less
than
that
subsequently
determined
to
be
due.
though
southern
pacific
contends
that
the
actions
with
respect
to
the
second
and
third
cars
do
not
violate
the
credit
regulations,
we
concede
a
violation
with
respect
to
the
first.
so
the
question
is
what
consequences
arise
from
that
violation.
and
the
courts
below
found
that
while
southern
pacific
had
made
a
prima
facie
case
of
a
right
to
recovery
from
the
consignor,
the
credit
violation
gave
rise
to
an
affirmative
defense
which
barred
collection
of
the
charges.
the
argument
i
would
like
to
make
this
morning
is
basically
twofold.
it
is
first,
that
the
lower
court's
decision
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
credit
regulations
as
well
as
their
language
and
history
and
50
years
of
case
law;
and
second,
that
the
decision,
if
allowed
to
stand,
will
have
serious
adverse
consequences
to
the
nation's
transportation
system.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
in
the
record,
but
it
is
conceded
in
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits
that
he
was
paid.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
one
of
our
reasons
for
saying
that
the
court
below
erred
is
based
on
the
contract
between
the
carrier
and
the
consignor.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
there
is
no
information
that
is
available
that
really
would
give
an
overall
percentage
of
that.
i
understand
in
the
case
of
southern
pacific
it
is
something
like
one-third.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
the
record
doesn't
show
the
status.
it
shows
that
the
summons
and
the
complaint
were
unable
to
be
served,
both
by
special
processor
who
were
hired
by
the
carrier,
and
subsequently
by
the
marshall's
office
of
the
court.
no
service
was
ever
made,
and
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
the
carrier
was
unable
even
to
track
down
the
consignee
through
the
secretary
of
state's
office
of
the
state
of
california.
so
all
that
the
record
really
shows
is
that
service
was
unable
to
be
obtained,
and
that
the
consignee
effectively
vanished.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
was
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question.
the
consignor
is
the
party
that
requests
the
transportation
service
and
selects
the
consignee.
and
the
consignor
fills
out
a
bill
of
lading,
which
is
the
basic
contract
between
the
consignor
and
the
carrier.
its
terms
are
described
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
unless
the
bill
of
lading
explicitly
provides
to
the
contrary,
the
consignor
is
presumed
to
be
primarily
liable
for
the
freight
charges.
the
consignor
has
the
option,
however,
of
disclaiming
liability
for
the
charges
by
executing
the
so-called
"non-recourse
clause"
that
appears
on
the
face
of
the
bill
of
lading.
if
the
consignor
fails
to
sign
the
non-recourse
clause,
it
becomes
primarily
liable
for
the
freight
charge,
and
the
carrier
knows
that
if
he
is
unable
to
collect
from
the
consignee,
he
can
then
turn
to
the
consignor
for
payment.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
well,
that
involves
the
business
relationships
essentially
between
the
consignor
and
the
consignee.
any
consignee
would
rather
receive
goods
on
credit,
and
most
goods
do
move
on
credit.
approximately
95
%
of
the
goods
in
interstate
freight
transportation
move
on
credit.
if
the
consignor
signs
the
non-recourse
clause
which
says
that
he
is
not
liable
for
payment,
the
carrier
is
then
more
likely
to
deliver
that
shipment
to
the
consignee
on
a
cod
basis,
unless
he
knows
the
consignee
well
and
has
dealt
with
him
in
the
past.
the
consignee
clearly
would
rather
not
have
that
situation
arise,
and
if
he
has
two
prospective
sellers
of
goods,
one
of
which
will
not
sign
the
non-recourse
clause
and
one
which
does,
he
would
rather
get
the
goods
from
the
consignor
so
it
will
arrive
on
a
credit
basis
rather
than
cod.
but
that
is
really
a
business
judgment
and
it
involves,
to
some
extent,
almost
whether
it
is
deemed
insulting
to
the
consignee
to
receive
it
on
that
basis.
but
in
any
event,
the
continuing
liability
of
the
consignor
who
does
not
sign
the
non-recourse
clause
is
clear
from
the
language
of
the
bill
of
lading
and
clear
under
the
case
law
for
the
last
60
years,
and
in
fact,
as
this
court
has
expressly
recognized
that
in
the
illinois
steel
case
cited
in
our
briefs.
the
cases
also
indicate
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
carrier
has
a
duty
to
collect
the
freight
charge,
and
if
he
cannot
collect
it
from
the
consignee,
he
must
try
to
collect
it
from
the
consignor.
allowing
a
violation
of
the
credit
regulations
to
be
used
as
a
bar
against
collection
from
the
consignor
would
be
inconsistent
with
those
cases
and
the
essential
purposes
that
they
endorse.
apart
from
the
contract,
the
principal
reason
for
our
position
basically
is
the
statute
and
the
regulations
are
part
of
a
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme,
and
they
are
totally
silent
on
any
affirmative
defense
arising
from
violation
of
the
credit
regulations.
and
i
would
like
to
speak
just
for
a
second
about
the
history.
the
credit
regulations
can
be
traced
back
to
1918
during
the
first
world
war
when
the
director
general
of
the
railroads
then
issued
something
called
general
order
number
25,
which
essentially
put
interstate
freight
transportation
on
a
cash
basis,
with
a
few
exceptions.
the
purposes
are
undisputed
for
taking
that
action.
they
were
to
increase
the
working
capital
of
the
carriers
by
reducing
the
amount
of
freight
charges
that
would
be
outstanding,
owed
by
the
consignees,
and
to
reduce
discrimination.
and
when
in
1920
the
congress
enacted
what
became
section
3(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
issue
here
involved...
that
is
the
basis
for
the
credit
regulations.
the
continued
that
same
policy.
carriers
were
told
that
they
could
not
deliver
freight
until
the
charges
were
paid,
except
under
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
should
prescribe.
the
same
purposes
were
true,
though...
to
protect
the
carriers
and
their
working
capital,
and
to
prevent
discrimination.
and
the
regulations
adopted
by
the
commission
left
a
great
deal
of
discretion
to
the
carriers.
the
main
one
is
one
that
says
that
the
carrier
can
extend
credit
for
a
specific
period
upon
taking
whatever
precautions
are
deemed
by
it
to
be
adequate
to
assure
payment.
those
regulations
are
still
in
effect
and
have
been
for
61
years,
they
are
enforced
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
primarily
through
a
$5000
civil
penalty,
but
also
occasionally
by
cease
and
desist
orders
or
injunctive
proceedings.
and
in
this
whole
regulatory
scheme
there
is
no
hint
that
a
credit
violation
can
be
utilized
as
an
affirmative
defense,
or
that
congress
intended
that
to
be
an
enforcement
mechanism.
and
that
engrafting
such
a
defense
on
the
regulatory
scheme
would
in
no
way
further
the
purposes
of
that
scheme,
which
were
to
protect
the
carrier's
working
capital
and
to
prevent
discrimination.
in
addition,
the
icc
has
taken
a
very
clear
position
on
this
same
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
it
has
expressly
said
in
the
cgf
grain
case
that
we
cite
in
our
briefs
that
a
credit
regulation...
credit
violation,
excuse
me...
has
no
effect
on
a
consignor's
liability.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
but
we
do
have
that
clear
expression
of
their
view
on
the
precise
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
and
the
agency's
interpretation,
the
agency
that
is
responsible
for
promulgating
the
regulations
and
enforcing
them
is,
we
submit,
entitled
to
great
weight.
and
lastly,
the
decisions
shortly
after
the
credit
regulations
were
issued
uniformly
rejected
arguments
that
violations
of
the
credit
regulations
barred
recovery
of
the
freight
charges.
and
we
cite
decisions
particularly
in
1924
and
1925
that
raised
exactly
the
same
issue
where
state
supreme
courts
rejected
the
same
contention
that
is
made.
the
same
thing
had
happened
when
the
motor
carrier
credit
regulations
were
promulgated
at
a
later
time
than
those
that
apply
to
the
railroads.
the
courts
considering
that
uniformly
rejected
estoppel
as
a
defense.
for
50
years
after
that
railroad
credit
regulation
was
issued,
no
court
held
that
a
violation
could
bar
recovery
of
freight
charges.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
the
icc?
it
is
called
cgf
grain.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we
have.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
351
icc,
710.
and
it
is
referred
to
in
both
of
our
briefs.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
recognize
that
there
are
cases
cited
by
commercial
metals
in
this
case,
virtually
all
of
which
involve
a
situation
where
there
is
a
consignee
who
has
had
some
misrepresentation
made
to
him
by
a
carrier,
and
the
result
is
that
the
consignee
has
relied
on
that
misrepresentation
and
taken
some
detrimental
action;
and
where
the
court
has
found
that
if
payment
were
to
be
required,
the
consignee
would
have
effectively
paid
twice.
and
the
courts
in
those...
or,
a
number
of
the
courts
addressing
those
cases
have
held
that
there
can
be
an
estoppel
in
that
situation.
what
i
would
point
out
is
that
whatever
the
merits
of
those
decisions,
those
cases
do
not
turn
on
a
violation
of
the
credit
regulations
but
rather
on
a
misrepresentation
by
the
carrier
in
detrimental
reliance.
and
they
involve
a
consignee,
not
a
consignor,
and
the
kind
of
situation
that
is
addressed
there
cannot
arise
in
the
consignor
context.
and
there
has
been
payment
by
someone
at
least
in
most
cases
of
the
full
charge,
albeit
to
the
wrong
person.
in
only
one
aberrational
case,
prior
to
this
one,
has
any
court
held
that
a
consignor
can
take
advantage
of
a
credit
violation.
all
other
cases
have
been
resolved
by
enforcing
payment.
and
what
we
say
is
that
in
the
fact
of
that
history
where
the
credit
regulations
have
been
interpreted
consistently
from
the
time
of
their
promulgation
through
the
next
50
years,
this
court
should
not,
in
the
1980's,
engraft
a
new
affirmative
defense
upon
them.
the
other
reasons
that
we
give
for
reaching
that
conclusion
have
to
do
with
the
consequences
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
if
the
decision
is
upheld,
one
result,
simple
result,
is
the
practical
elimination
of
the
non-recourse
clause
which
has
been
in
the
bill
of
lading
for
61
years
and
which
obviously
has
been
viewed
as
having
some
purpose.
and
i
say
that
it
will
be
practically
eliminated
because
the
credit
regulations
require
that
payment
be
made
within
five
days.
if
the
shipper
doesn't
pay
it
within
five
days,
technically
a
credit
violation
will
have
occurred.
and
whenever
the
carrier
then
turns
to
the
consignor,
the
consignor
will
be
able
to
say
well,
you
violated
the
credit
regulations
by
not
forcing
payment
within
that
five-day
period,
so
in
effect,
it
will
make
no
difference
whether
the
non-recourse
clause
is
signed
or
not.
second
and
more
importantly,
more
and
more
consignors
and
consignees
will
claim
that
they
do
not
have
to
pay
because
of
some
credit
violation.
there
are
several
possible
results
to
this,
all
of
them
we
submit
bad.
first,
the
carriers,
as
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
ata
and
the
aer
indicate,
may
be
forced
to
curtail
extensions
of
credit.
as
i
mentioned,
95
%
of
freight
now
moves
on
credit,
and
the
amount
of
credit
outstanding
on
shipments
in
any
year
is
something
like
$25
billion.
if
a
carrier
knows
that
the
consignor
will
no
longer
be
liable
for
a
charge
if
he
is
unable
to
collect
from
the
consignee,
the
carrier
will
insist
on
payment
cod
in
a
much
higher
percentage
of
the
cases.
this
has
a
serious
effect
on
the
credit
relationships;
it
also
will
impair
efficient
rail
operations
because
it
will
result
in
cars
having
to
sit
there
for
a
longer
period
of
time
until
cash
can
be
obtained
from
the
consignee.
and
in
addition,
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
not
overlook
the
increased
litigation
that
inevitably
will
occur
in
order
to
ascertain
liability
for
freight
charges.
the
decision
below
will
be
read
as
saying
that
every
violation
of
the
credit
regulations
gives
rise
to
an
affirmative
defense.
that
would
be
highly
unfair,
and
even
commercial
metals
does
not
go
that
far.
when
the
icc
has
reviewed
the
operation
of
the
credit
regulations
from
time
to
time,
they
have
found
that
many
violations
occur,
many
violations
are
unavoidable,
and
that
the
majority
of
those
violations
are
actually
caused
by
shippers
rather
than
carriers.
and
that
is
because
of
this
situation
where
the
icc's
jurisdiction
is
over
the
carriers.
the
regulations
are
worded
that
payment
must
be
received
within
five
days,
if
it
is
properly
extended
in
the
first
place.
well,
the
carrier
often
doesn't
have
any
control
over
whether
that
payment
can
be
enforced
or
not
from
the
consignee.
so
it
clearly
would
be
unfair
to
say
that
there
is
any
kind
of
an
estoppel
situation
in
all
cases.
so
what
commercial
metals
has
done
in
this
case
is
take
the
position
that
there
is
a
fault
standard
which
should
be
read
into
this.
they
are
basically
saying
that
there
should
be
an
estoppel
only
when
the
violation
is
the
carrier's
fault.
but
i
suggest
that
that
is
part
of
a
standard
that
raises
many
hard
issues.
first
of
all,
what
is
meant
by
fault.
is
negligence
enough,
or
does
the
carrier
have
to
take
some
action
intentionally
in
order
to
violate
the
regulations
or
create
some
discrimination?
the
regulations
say,
moreover,
that
before
extending
credit,
a
carrier
must
take
whatever
precautions
it
deems
appropriate,
so
it
leaves
it
essentially
up
to
the
carrier
what
precautions
to
take.
well,
if
fault
becomes
the
test,
will
there
be
some
standard
read
into
that.
will
the
carrier
be
required
to
take
some
minimal
precautions
so
that
it
is
no
longer
up
to
him
entirely
what
he
should
do,
and
what
standards
would
be
applied.
failure
to
pay
within
five
days.
that
is
something
that
would
not
appear
to
be
the
fault
of
the
carrier
in
most
cases.
but
if
a
court
has
to
determine
whether
a
failure
to
collect
is
a
carrier's
fault,
can
it
impose
some
standard
on
the
carrier
to
do
something
other
than
just
sit
there
for
those
five
days?
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
the
record
indicates
that
the
carrier
did
not
investigate
the
credit
worthiness
of
the
consignee.
we
know
nothing
beyond
that.
we
don't
know
whether
the
agent
who
had
the
car
tendered
to
him
felt
that
he
knew
enough
about
the
company
based
on
his
personal
knowledge,
or
the
fact
that
it
had
a
plant
across
the
street
or
whatever,
that
he
could
make
his
own
determination,
or
what.
we
just
know
there
was
no
investigation
of
credit
worthiness.
so
in
determining
the
trick
question--
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
--i
am
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
that
would
violate
the
credit
regulations,
by--
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
--i
am
suggesting
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
blanket
rule
saying
that
in
the
case
of
consignors
who
have
the
opportunity
to
protect
themselves
by
signing
the
non-recourse
clause,
there
should
be
no--
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
that
is
the
way
it
has
been
up
until
now.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
it
is
our
position
that
there
should
be
a
blanket
rule,
but
let
me
say
further
on
that...
we
concede
that
there
is
a
violation
in
this
case.
we
don't
concede
that
there
is
any
connection
between
that
violation
and
the
loss
that
occurred,
which
is
something
we
think
the
courts
below
slurred
over
very
quickly.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
in
our
view,
it
should
not.
but
on
that
first
shipment,
there
was
no
credit
check.
but
the
carrier
in
that
case
could
have,
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
the
second
and
third
shipments,
required
a
check.
that
would
not
have
violated
the
credit
regulations,
but
the
check
would
have
bounced
the
same
way
the
other
two
did,
and
it
would
have...
the
result
would
have
been
the
same.
we
would
have
been
unable
to
collect
from
the
consignee
and
had
to
turn
to
the
consignor.
so
we
don't
think
there
is
a
causal
connection
between
those
two
events.
so
in
addition
to
determining
the
tricky
question
of
whether
a
violation
has
occurred,
the
courts,
if
the
rule
advanced
by
commercial
metals
were
to
prevail,
would
also
have
to
grapple
with
this
vague
fault
standard,
applying
it
in
particular
factual
situations
and
along
the
way,
coming
up
with
possibly
some
kind
of
substantive
standards.
and
since
the
dispute
would
be
between
two
private
parties,
there
would
be
no
assistance
from
the
agency
that
is
charged
with
enforcing
and
promulgating
the
regulations.
and
also,
since
many
of
the
actions
would
be
in
state
courts
that
might
have
their
own
different
standards
to
apply
in
equitable
estoppel
cases,
the
result
clearly
will
be
not
only
increased
litigation,
but
inconsistent
results,
and
the
result
would
be
to
take
an
issue
that
for
the
last
60
years
has
been
characterized
by
certainty
and
uniformity
and
transform
it
into
one
where
confusion
and
inconsistent
results
will
probably
prevail.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
we
don't
deny
that
the
statement
in
that
case
is
essentially
addictive,
that
it
is
a
statement
of
the
agency's
position
which
is
broad
and
covers
this
situation.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
oh,
that
is
true.
they
are
saying
that
when
that
dispute
arises
it
will
be
the
court
that
decides
it.
but
in
the
face
of
a
lack
of
support,
as
a
legal
matter,
for
the
proposition
advanced
by
commercial
metals
and
in
view
of
the
adverse
practical
consequences
that
will
occur,
i
think
the
court
has
to
ask
what
is
there
to
commend
an
affirmative
defense
in
a
situation
like
this.
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
no
policy
reasons
relating
to
the
credit
regulations
or
the
credit
statute
that
would
be
advanced
by
allowing
this
defense;
in
fact,
it
is
contrary
to
those
purposes,
and
there
is
no
policy
justification
in
terms
of
the
effective
operation
of
the
transportation
system.
and
further,
there
is
no
need
because
the
consignor
already
has
the
ability
to
protect
himself,
but
wants
this
court
to
create
an
additional
remedy
for
him.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
necessary
or
justified.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
h.
pipkin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
really
have
nothing
to
add
unless
there
are
question
by
the
bench.
