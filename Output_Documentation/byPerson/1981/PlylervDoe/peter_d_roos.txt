mr.
peter
d.
roos
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
as
mr.
schey
has
articulated,
it
is
our
view
that
the
nub
of
this
case
is
that
undocumented
children
are
similarly
situated
to
their
permanent
resident
and
citizen
classmates.
i
would
like
to
highlight
some
of
those
facts,
and
then
get
into
the
legal
discussion
that
the
chief
justice
asked
about
concerning...
and
justice
brennan,
because
the
issues
are
on
the
table.
with
respect
to
the
residency
situation,
i
think
it
is
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
doe
trial
have
been
here
for
a
number
of
years.
indeed,
the
doe
family
has
been
here
since
1964.
they
own
property
in
tyler.
they
pay
taxes
on
that
property.
their
children
attended
schools
for
five
or
six
years
before
they
were
excluded
from
those
schools.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
they
are
unlawful
aliens
in
this
country,
they
came
to
this
country
unlawfully,
but
they
have
been
here
for
15
years.
they
have
paid
taxes.
their
educational
needs
are
the
same
as
other
children.
indeed,
these
children...
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
the
unique
educational
needs
of
undocumented
children.
indeed,
undocumented
children
are
like
other
children.
some,
like
the
doe
children,
have
been
here
for
15
years,
have
no
english
language
problems,
have
no
particular
problems
whatsoever.
others
are
new
immigrants,
and
as
the
testimony
shows,
like
new
immigrants,
like
all
new
immigrants,
they
may
have
language
needs,
may
have
various
other
needs,
but
indeed,
to
fence
out
a
class
of
undocumented
children
is
to
fence
out
a
class
of
children.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
the
testimony
in
both
the
doe
trials
and
in
the
other
trial
was
that
indeed
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
very
limited
resources.
they
do
not
go
after
families
except
in
a
rare
instance.
that
is
in
the
record.
the
district--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
think
the
one--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--there
certainly
is
something
in
the
record.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
the...
yes,
in
the
in
re
alien
children
case
there
was
such
a
finding.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
we
have
two
consolidated
cases
that--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--the
in
re
alien
children
number
is
1934.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
1934,
your
honor,
and
that
finding
is
based
upon
testimony
of
leon
l.
castillo.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
the
finding
is
that
there
is
a
de
facto
amnesty
policy
in
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
yes,
and
that
was
the
testimony
of
mr.
castillo's.
that
is
not
the
official
policy,
but
that
is
the
de
facto
policy.
when
you
have--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
suppose
without
getting
into...
i
think
when
the
term
was
used
by
the
former
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
he
was
not
using
it
as
a
term
of
art,
he
was
using
it
to
describe
the
situation.
these
children
are
here.
they
are
going
to
remain
here.
and
that
testimony
was
repeatedly...
repeatedly
repeated
by
his
subordinates,
the
director
of
the
immigration
and
naturaliation
service
in
dallas
and
the
director
in
houston,
that
indeed
they
do
not
find
families.
families
generally
are
not
reported
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
and
thus
in
fact
will
remain
here.
mr.
castillo
also
in
making
the
statement
observed
that,
as
others
observed
in
the
record,
that
indeed
there
are
something
like
250
ins
border
patrol
agents
for
2,000
20
miles
of
texas
border,
a
number
that
is
substantially
fewer
than
the
number
of
police
in
dallas,
texas.
those
statistics,
i
think,
tell
us
something
about
the
commitment
to
manning
the
border,
and
certainly
tell
us
the
likelihood
of
these
children
ever
being
identified
and
deported.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
under--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--well,
hines
versus
davidowitz,
and
the
line
of
cases
under
pre-emption.
those
cases
make
clear
that
regulating
the
ebb
and
flow
of
a
national
border
is
exclusively
a
federal--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
would
certainly
argue
that
they
would
not,
and
the
policy
reasons
that
underline
hines
and
those
cases
would
militate
against
permitting
such
a
policy.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
would
think,
your
honor,
if
there
were
an
express
policy
of
the
federal
government
permitting
states
to
engage
in
this
sort
of
activity,
that
the
policy
implications
of
hines
and
other
cases
would
not
be...
would
not
be
implicated,
but
absent
essentially
a
deputizing
of
state
officials--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--what
about?
mr.
peter
d.
roos
decanas,
your
honor.
i
suppose
it
is
notable
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
of
course
decanas
was
not
an
equal
protection
case.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
yes.
well,
as
i
read
decanas,
it
allows
states
to
enact
laws
that
have
purposes
other
than
regulating
the
border,
and
if
those
purposes
have--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
such
a
purpose
ought
to
be
declared
impermissible
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
putting
aside
any
implications
it
may
have
under
pre-emption,
that
under
this
court's
rulings,
that
for
a
state
to
go
about
regulating
the
border,
to
have
as
a--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--your
honor,
we
have
given
that
matter
considerable
thought.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
it
seems
to
us
that
this
court's
alienage
decisions,
equal
protection
decisions
have
always
kept
one
eye
on
what
the
federal
government
has
done,
and
in
this
particular
area,
when
we
are
talking
about
employment,
the
federal
government
has
essentially
prohibited
the
employment
of
undocumented
aliens.
now,
it
is
our
belief
that
indeed,
that
not
only
is
this
legislation
irrational,
but
indeed
ought
to
be
measured
under
a
compelling
state
interest
test.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
even
supposing
it
isn't,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
where
there
is
an
express
federal
purpose,
such
as
barring
undocumented
people
from
work,
that
if
a
state
passes
a
law
to
essentially
implement
that
express
federal
purpose,
then
this
court
ought
to
look
at
that
with
the
deference
it
gives
to
congressional--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--first,
i
suppose
there
are
two
level
of
response,
your
honor.
the
first
level
is
that--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
will
address
that.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
if
you
would
address
your
question
again.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
let
me
address
justice
marshal's
question
briefly.
it
obviously
is
a
central--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--the
equal
protection
clause
speaks
in
terms
of
coverage
of
persons,
and
it
is
to
be
contrasted
historically
with
the
clause
that
immediately
precedes
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clause,
which
grants
privileges
and
immunities
to
citizens.
this
court
has
looked
to
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause,
or
to
the
due
process
clause
and
have
said
that
persons
are
undocumented...
include
undocumented
persons,
because
they
are
indeed
persons.
the
legislative
history
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
tells
us
really
two
things.
it
first
of
all
tells
us
that
the
primary
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
clearly
thought
of,
at
least
in
terms
of
coverage,
of
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
as
protecting
the
same
group
of
people.
in
our
brief,
we
cite
to
representative
bingham,
who
was
commonly
acknowledged
to
be
the
author
of
section
one
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
he
spoke
of
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
alike
as
protecting
the
citizen
and
the
stranger.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
were--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--certainly
with
respect
to
coverage.
we
have
found,
and
there
is
not
cited
in
any
opposing
brief,
and
there
are,
as
the
court
is
aware,
any
number
of
opposing
briefs--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--certainly.
we
found
nothing
that
would
indicate
that
insofar
as
coverage
is
concerned,
that
representative
bingham
said
anything
inconsistent
with
that.
likewise,
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
the
floor
manager
was
senator
howard,
and
senator
howard
spoke
of
the
two
clauses
in
terms
of
coverage
in
the
same
words,
and
spoke
of
them
together,
and
when
he
spoke
of
them,
he
spoke
of
them
as
protecting
whomever
should
be
within
the
country.
so,
i
believe
on
the
basis
of
the
clear
language
of
those
provisions,
the
history,
and
indeed
the
logic
which
has
been
pointed
out
earlier,
absent
the
right
of
coverage
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
state
could
do,
could
treat
undocumented
people
arbitrarily
and
irrationally.
what
would
be
the
limitations
upon
a
state
should
there
not
be
the
minimal
protection
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
so,
as
well
as
the
clear
language
and
history
of
that
clause,
we
believe
that
logic
compels
a
similar
finding.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
the
evidence
quite
clearly
reflects
that
education
is
a
minimal
pull
factor
in
terms
of
illegal
immigration.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
repeatedly--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
am
referring
to
testimony
by
the
state's
own
witnesses.
we
would,
for
example,
refer
to
shane
davies,
who
said,
as
an
attractive
factor,
no,
it
is
not.
we
would
refer
to
the
testimony
of
the
director
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
dallas,
a
mr.
heston,
who
said,
no,
indeed,
immigration,
unlawful
immigration
has
little
to
do
with...
or
education
has
little
to
do
with
unlawful
immigration.
i
would
also
point
this
court
to,
with
respect
to
undocumented
people
returning
to
mexico
after
the
statute,
the
evidence
by,
again,
the
state's
own
witness,
the
superintendent
of
brownsville,
said,
no
matter
what,
these
children
will
remain
here.
so,
i
think
that
the
fact
is,
they
will
remain
here,
that
indeed
education
is
a
minimal
pull
factor,
and
the
preclusion
of
education
will
not
appreciably
deal
with
the
unlawful
immigration
problem.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
i
am
aware
of
cases
that
have
gone
up
and
down
on
elkins--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--this
is
not
certainly
a
domicile
law.
as
we
have
pointed
out,
some--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--it
is...
it
would
certainly
be
my
view
that
one
could
not
use
domicile
as
a
proxy
for
alienage.
for
example,
well,
that
if
undocumented
persons
are
indeed
persons
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
thus
a
state
legislation
must
treat
them
minimally
rationally,
and
indeed
we
believe
insofar
as
they
are
denied...
innocent
children
are
denied
an
education
with
heightened
scrutiny,
that
that
indeed...
it
could
not
then
turn
around
and
say,
we
have
got
a
domiciliary
law,
aliens
cannot
become
domiciliaries,
and
then
keep
all
these
innocent
children
out
of
school.
that
would
seem
to
be
contrary
to
any
sort
of
basic
notions
of
justice
or
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
if
there
were
an
express
federal
policy
excluding--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--if
there
were
an
express
federal
policy
saying
undocumented
children
should
not
attend
school,
then
it
would
be
our
position
that
texas
might
well
be
able
to--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--we
are
arguing
that,
and
indeed,
as
indicated,
this
has
minimal
impact
on
keeping
undocumented
people
out
of
the
country.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
we
are--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--with
respect
to
equal
protection...
as
the
court
has
recognized,
indeed,
the
primary
thrust
of
this
case
is
an
equal
protection
case.
we
do
not
argue
pursuant
to
decanas
that
this
statute,
because
it
has
an
incidental
effect
on
immigration,
is
thus
pre-empted.
now,
we
do
make
other
pre-emption
arguments
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of.
indeed,
it
is
our
position
that
federal
education
policy
as
found
primarily
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
expresses
a
federal
policy
that
all
children,
especially
those
children
who
are
most
in
need,
and
in
many
instances
those
are
undocumented
children,
should
be
provided
with
education
if
they
are
to
be
here.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
would
restrict
decanas
to
dealing
with
the
employment
field
and
the
incidental
effect
on
unlawful
immigration.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
no,
the
pre-emption
argument
is
predicated
upon
a
different
federal
statute
or
set
of
statutes,
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act,
which
in
our
view
mandate
that
all
children,
especially
those
in
need,
receive
free
public
education,
and
we
would
point
out,
as
we
do
in
our
brief,
that
there
are
a
number
of
federal
titles
to
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
which
would
have
been...
would
invited
openings
by
congress
if
it
had
been
so
inclined.
for
example,
there
is
the
federal
bilingual
education
act,
title
vii
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act.
and
in
that
act,
one
of
the
definitions
of
who
is
entitled
to
a
program
are
people
born
in
another
country.
they
have
never
said
anything
about
undocumented
aliens.
there
is
obviously
a
common
assumption
that
undocumented
aliens
frequently
are
migrant
children.
there
is
a
title
i
migrant
program.
never
has
congress
said,
we
exclude
from
inclusion
in
the
title
i
migrant
programs
undocumented
children.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
the
distinction
that
we
draw,
and
i
tried
to
draw
with
justice
brennan,
is
that
where
the
federal
policy
is
expressed
with
respect
to
this
particular
service,
education
in
this
case--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--we
argue
that
it
would
be
offensive
to
the
principles
of
hines
and
this
court's
long
line
of
cases
that
this
would
be...
that
for
a
state
to
set
about
to
regulate
the
border,
even
if
it
were
in
pursuance
of
a
state
policy--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--yes.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
obviously--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
am
not
certain
that
it
can,
but
it
is...
i
mean,
each
case
has
to
be
decided
on
its
own.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
it
would
be
our
view
that
if
there
indeed
were
an
express
federal
policy
excluding
undocumented
children
from
school,
that
if
the
state
passed
a
law--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
would
certainly
feel
that
there
are
reasons
for
holding
that
it
would
violate
equal
protection,
but
i
understand
this
court
has
traditionally
given
deference
to
congressional
alienage
classifications.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
it
would
certainly
be--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--yes.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
there
are
distinctions--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--there
may
be
distinctions
between
elementary
and
secondary
education--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--i
would
suggest
that
the
answer
is
not
a
yes
or
no,
that
indeed
one
would
have
to
look
at
the
state
purpose
and--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--what
they
would
do,
i
believe,
under
your
hypothetical,
would
be
using
alienage
to
define
resident.
if
the--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--well,
using
illegal
alienage.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
this
court
has
at
various
times
noted
that
subclasses
of
aliens
are
still
protected
by
the
alienage
analysis
of
this
court's
ruling.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
think
that
the
analysis
would
generally
be
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
conclusion
would
generally
be
no,
but
of
course
each
case
ought
to
be
looked
at
on
its
own.
you
would
be
dealing
with
people
above
the
age
of
majority
so
the
innocent
factor
that
was
referred
to
earlier,
certainly,
the
argument
for
compelling
interest
is
not
the
same,
and
indeed
the
analysis
under
a
rational
basis
would
be
somewhat
different.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
well,
i
suppose
the
answer
is
that
49
other
states
admit
these
children
because
they
feel
that
they
are
here
and
it
is
their
obligation
to
educate
people
who
are
in
their
boundaries
and
who
in
fact
need
education.
texas
alone
among
the
states
poses
this
terrible
dilemma,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize,
as
mr.
schey
mentioned
earlier,
that
indeed
california,
for
example,
the
testimony
reflects
likely
has
twice
as
many
undocumented
persons
as
does
texas,
yet
the
court
will
note
that
an
amicus
curiae
brief
was
filed
by
the
california
state
board
of
education.
no,
i
think
that
the
texas
dilemma
is
something
that
has
been
suggested
as--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--they
certainly
are,
and
it
is
our
position
here,
of
course,
that
this
violates
the
federal
constitution.
