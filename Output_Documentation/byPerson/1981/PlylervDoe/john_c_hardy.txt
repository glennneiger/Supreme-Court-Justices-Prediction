mr.
john
c.
hardy
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
locally,
within
the
tyler
independent
school
district,
where
this
case
originated,
in
the
doe
v.
tyler
case,
we
had
a
local
policy
that
was
enacted
by
the
school
board
to
hopefully
follow
up
to
the
state
statute.
the
state
statute
requiring...
i
am
going
to
argue,
hopefully,
in
a
minute,
on
the
residency-non-residency
status,
but
the
local
policy
was
that
if
anyone
that
wanted
to
attend
the
tyler
independent
school
district
or
the
local
school
district
on
a
tuition-free
basis,
all
they
had
to
show
was
legal
residence
within
our
district,
then
that
could
be
done
even
if
they
could
show
any
entitlement
or
that
they
were
seeking
entitlement
to
be
admitted
to
this
country
legally,
a
letter
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
they
were
applying,
any
document,
not
that
they
had
actually
received
that
status,
but
they
were
at
least
attempting
to
receive
that
legal
status.
in
our
case,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
every
one
of
these
students
and
their
parents,
they
came
across
the
border
illegally.
they
were
illegal
from
the
first
time
they
walked
across
the
river.
they
did
not
overstay
a
green
card
or
a
work
permit.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes,
if
they
have
either
authorization
papers
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--no,
sir,
they
could
have
a
birth
certificate.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
from
the
united
states.
surely.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
but
my
point--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--if
the
people
that
have
come
across
are
residing
here
on
a
work
permit,
a
permit
that
would
allow--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--ins.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
any
legal
status,
any
documentation.
we
have
i
think
it's
an
i-20
that
it's
called
that
the
federal
government
has
for
a
student
permit
to--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
a
green
card
is
a
work
permit.
an
orange
card--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--ins.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
a
green
card
is
a
commuter.
an
orange
card
is
a
work
permit.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
no,
sir,
that
is
not
sufficient.
that
is
basically
a
three-day
pass
that
you
are
coming
across
into
the
country
for
a
shopping
trip
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
if
they
have
a
work
permit
and
they
are
residing
in
this
country,
that
would
allow
them
to
attend
the
schools.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
the
parents'
children.
if
the
parents--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--we
allow
them
and
would
allow
them
with
a
work
permit
to
have
their
children
in
the
school
free
of
charge.
i
would
like--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--an
illegal
alien
become
a
legal
domiciliary?
i--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--i
believe
it
is
not.
and
i
will
turn--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--justice
o'connor,
if
there
are,
i
haven't
found
them,
and
i
know
of
none.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
agree.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
that's
correct,
because
if
they
do
not
have
legal
resident
status
or
domiciliary
status
legally,
it
is
our
argument
and
our
position
that
they
cannot
attain
the
resident
status
requiring
them
to
attend...
or
allowing
them
to
attend
school
free
of
charge.
i
think
that
the
key
issue
in
this
point
is
the
classification
in
the
statute.
it
is
not
alienage
or
citizenship;
it
is
between
a
legal
resident
and
a
non-legal
resident,
or
a
residency
statute
and
a
non-residency
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
non-resident
citizens
and
non-resident
aliens
are
both
required
to
pay
tuition.
the
state
classification
was
based
upon
a
judgment
that
the
state
and
the
school
district
would
provide
a
free
education
for
those
who
are
legal
residents,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
legal
residents
is
more
than
mere
presence
within
the
boundaries.
the
court
has
continuously
held,
and
i
think
that
it
is
an
appropriate
holding,
that
in
higher
education
branches,
that
a
non-resident
of
the
state
can
be
charged
a
different
tuition
than
a
resident
of
the
state,
and
we
are
talking
about
a
resident
within
the
country
or
a
non-resident
on
legal
status,
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
distinction
that
has
to
be
to
carry
it
out
there.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes,
that
if
we
were
to
try...
texas
does
not
have
the
right
or
authority...
i
think
that
we
are
pre-empted
from
making
something
along
the
lines
of
what
is
the
legal...
how
they
can
come
into
the
country.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
don't
think
that
we
can
treat
them
as
legal
residents.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
disagree
with
that
analogy.
i
don't--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--federal
funds,
locally
our
funds
are
broken
down
2
percent
federal
funds,
40--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
well,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
a
rule
that
it
is
against
federal
law
to--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--or
for
them
just
to
walk...
to
come
into
the
country
without
some
documentation.
otherwise,
the
entire
immigration
and
naturalization
service
laws
and
the
laws
that
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
would
have
no
merit.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes.
i
would
question
the
word
"permit".
mr.
john
c.
hardy
well,
in
our
case--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--that's
correct.
there
are
some
in
this
case
that
own,
you
know,
own
property.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
absolutely
not.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
some
of
them
have
driver's
licenses.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
deny
them
fire
protection?
mr.
john
c.
hardy
okay.
if
their
home
is
on
fire,
their
home
is
going
to
be
protected
with
the
local
fire
services
just--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
because...
i
am
going
to
take
the
position
that
that
is
an
entitlement
of
the...
justice
marshal,
let
me
think
a
second.
you...
that
is...
i
don't
know.
that
is
a
tough
question.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
am
sorry?
mr.
john
c.
hardy
no.
i
think
that
they
are
afforded
all
the
due
process
procedures
and
the
other
problems
that
are
attributable
to
that.
we
are
not
talking
about
denying
them
all
rights.
i
am
talking
and
attempting
to
talk
about
the
resident
and
non-resident--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--i
don't
believe
so.
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
you
are
placing
a
one-year
requirement
on
me?
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
know
the
court's
rule
on
a
one-year
requirement.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
think
we
would
have
to
look
to
the
merits
of
that
individual
case,
on
the
basis
of,
did
they
actually
set
up
a
legal
residence
here.
they
have
a
right
to
set
up
a
legal
residence
here.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
no.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
the
difference
here
is
that
texas
has
oil
wells
for
its
university
and
virginia
doesn't.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
it
is
the
same--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--that's
possible.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
might
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
at
a
certain
age,
i
would
have
to
argue
that,
yes,
that
the
children...
i
am
realistic
enough
to
know
that
they
don't
have
either
the
know-how
or
the
knowledge
to
go
through
the
process
at
ins.
but
i
believe
that
one
of
the
key
issues
is
that
the
federal
government
has
the
law
that
provides
that
these
people
are
illegal.
they
have
violated
those
laws.
they
cannot
attain
a
resident
status.
they
cannot
become
a
legal
resident
or
a
local
domiciliary
of
this
country
or
the
state
of
texas,
and
getting
away
from
the
equal
protection
argument
and
going
to
the
resident,
non-resident
status
and
the
difference
on
the
basis
of
tuition
charging
on
that
basis
i
think
is
appropriate.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
with
all
due
respect,
may
i
ask
that
the
state
address
that
question
in
our
rebuttal?
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
absolutely.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
no.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
the
father
and
family
has
a
legal
right,
a
legal
residence,
and
a
legal
domicile
within
our
borders.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
test
on
the
domicile
of
someone
that
has
the
right
to
be
within
the
borders.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
to
me
the
analogy
is
such
that
a
virginian
or
someone
from
washington,
d.
c.,
coming
to
the
state
of
texas
has
that
right.
they
are
legal
residents
of
this
country,
and
they
can
be
domiciled
under
the
constitution
wherever
they
want
to
be.
they
have
a
status
that
cannot
be
gained
by
the
people
coming
across
the
border
from
mexico
without
some--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--no,
because
i
believe
that
the
professor
would
have
the
proper
authority
and
the
proper
identification
to
be
here
legally.
he
would
be
here
either
on
a
work
permit,
a
temporary
resident
status,
or
some
other
indication
that
would
allow
him
to
be
here
in
the
country.
under
some
color
or
title
or
interest
in
law,
he
would
be
coming
here
as
an
invitee.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
think
that
it
is
that
simple,
but
for
some
reason
i
haven't
been
able
to
boil
it
down
that
simple,
that
the
resident
and
the
non-resident
status,
i
believe,
is
the
key
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
absolutely.
i
think
that
being
a...
we
are
talking
about
a
federal
law.
being
a
u.
s.
citizen
grants
certain
rights
regarding
your
movement
within
this
country
of
any
of
the
50
states.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
i
am
sure
they
could
pass
a
law.
i
don't
know--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--no,
it
would
not.
i
don't
see
a
rational
basis.
you
are
talking
about
all
kinds
of
constitutional
problems.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
basically--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--i
don't
want
to
move
too
far...
i
can
answer
that
question,
but
one
thing
that
would
concern
me,
i
realize
it
is
only
a
federal
misdemeanor
crime--
mr.
john
c.
hardy
--i
think
that,
yes,
sir,
that
is
one
of
the
main
points.
mr.
john
c.
hardy
thank
you.
