unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
question,
counsel.
if
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
protective
of
undocumented
aliens,
could
the
state
of
texas
impose
harsher
criminal
penalties
upon
them?
unknown
speaker
there
can't
be
any
question,
can
there,
that
an
alien,
documented
or
undocumented,
brought
before
a
criminal
court
is
entitled
to
the
same
due
process
as
any
other
person
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
mr.
arnett--
--you
mean
walk
across
the
rio
grande?
unknown
speaker
there
are
small
places.
unknown
speaker
but
the
river
is
there.
the
river
is
the
boundary.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
to
cross
the
river.
unknown
speaker
general
arnett,
if
you
are
dealing
with
commuters,
people
who
reside
outside
the
district
and
come
across
just
to
go
to
school,
couldn't
you
handle
that
problem
by
just
saying
you
must
be
a
resident
of
the
district
in
order
to
attend
the
school?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you
don't
need
it
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
people
who
live
in
mexico
and
come
back
and
forth,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
really
not
trying
to
persuade
us
that
it
is
a
problem
dealing
with
people
who
commute
every
day?
unknown
speaker
mr.
arnett,
i
would
like
to
ask
you,
please,
whether
texas
interprets
the
statute
as
applying
to
exclude
only
students
not
capable
of
establishing
domicile
under
texas
law.
unknown
speaker
is
that
texas's
interpretation
of
its
statute?
unknown
speaker
assuming
that
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
to
these
students,
would
you
tell
me
how
you
would
then
analyze
it,
assuming
a
rational
basis
test
were
applied?
what
is
the
permissible
state
objective?
unknown
speaker
do
the
undocumented
aliens
in
texas
pay
taxes,
the
property
taxes,
for
example,
that
are
used
to
support
the
schools?
unknown
speaker
does
texas
have
an
income
tax,
a
state
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
you
are
relying
on
property
taxes
and
the
ad
valorem
taxes?
unknown
speaker
general
arnett,
this
may
be
sort
of
a
stupid
question,
but
i
have
some
trouble
understanding
the
facts.
if
you
know
who
all
the
illegal
alien
children
in
the
schools
are,
does
the
state
take
any
steps
to
identify
their
parents
and
suggest
to
the
federal
authorities
that
they
should
be
removed
from
the
state?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
can
identify
10,000
or
11,000
children
who
are
going
to
school
every
day,
and
you
know
they
are
residents,
it
seems
to
me
a
particularly
easy
enforcement
problem
if
you
were
desirous
of
getting
them
excluded,
if
you
know
who
they
are,
and
i
presume
you
must,
if
you
are
going
to
throw
them
out
of
class.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
not
citizens.
this
is
a
state
government.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
your
question?
this
is
the
state
government.
yes,
it
is
kind
of
a
puzzling
set
of
facts.
you
mean
ins
just
paid
no
attention
to
a
state
complaint?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
that
you
assume...
the
other
side
argues
this,
and
i
didn't
know
what
your
position
was...
that
these
children
will
remain
in
the
school
district
because
it
is
just
too
much
of
an
administrative
burden
to
get
them
deported,
so
they
are
going
to
be
part
of
the
community
anyway,
and
you
would
rather
have
them
uneducated
than
educated?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
90
percent
of
the
illegal
immigration
are
individuals
who
do
not
have
children.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
understand
you
to
say
the
problem
was
not
the
children
who
are
already
there.
i
thought
i
read
somewhere
in
the
briefs
that
so
many
of
these
come
and
go.
i
think
i
read
somewhere
that
it
was
estimated
that
90
percent
of
the
illegals
are
not
there
permanently.
they
just
come
and
go.
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
arnett,
returning
to
the
questions
with
respect
to
whether
the
school
district
should
assist
the
federal
government
in
the
deportation
of
these
people,
do
i...
i
have
the
impression
that
your
friends
on
the
other
side
take
the
position
that
this
is
purely
a
federal
matter,
and
the
states
and
local
districts
have
no
jurisdiction,
no
responsibility
for
identifying
deportable
aliens.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hardy,
before
you
commence,
what
is
the
process
for
documentation?
the
briefs
are
full
of
reference
to
undocumented
aliens.
how
does
one
become
documented?
and
who
does
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
say
they
are
illegal,
how
could
texas
determine
that
they
are
legal?
you
say
they
are
illegal
when
they
come
across,
they
stay
there
for
six
months
or
whatever,
and
you
document
them
as
being
legal
residents?
unknown
speaker
they
have
to
have
something
from
the
immigration
authorities
before
you
document
them?
unknown
speaker
from
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
so
if
they
are
still
without
evidence
from
the
federal
government
or
a
birth
certificate,
they
remain
illegal
and
not
eligible
for
the
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
parent
has
a
green
work
card,
does
that
satisfy
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
evidence
from
ins
that
satisfies
your
rule?
unknown
speaker
a
work
permit
issued
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
right.
that
is
one.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
others?
unknown
speaker
is
that
also
issued
by
ins?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
green
card?
unknown
speaker
who
issues
that?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
sufficient?
a
green
card
is
a
commuter
permit,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
a
green
card
is
not
sufficient?
is
that
right?
if
all
you
have
is
a
green
card,
that
is
only
a
commuter
card.
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
work
permit?
unknown
speaker
who
are
they?
you
mean
the
parents?
unknown
speaker
they
may
bring
their
children
with
them,
if
they
have
a
work
permit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hardy,
under
texas
law,
is
it
possible
for
an
undocumented
alien
to
become
a
legal
domiciliary
of
texas?
unknown
speaker
to
become
a
domiciliary?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
texas
cases
dealing
with
that
question,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
you
can't
become
a
legal
resident
of
the
united
states
without
some
evidence
from
the
federal
authorities.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
are
telling
me
that
without
some
documentation
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
long
an
undocumented
child
is
present
in
texas.
you
do
not
recognize
them
as
entitled
to
go
to
school
or
have
the
privileges
of
domiciliaries
or
residents.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
out
of
the
united
states
position
in
this
case.
the
united
states
suggests
that
its
immigration
policy
does
not
pre-empt
some
efforts
of
texas
to
do
what
it
is
doing.
at
least
it
suggests
that
this
provision
that
is
at
issue
here
is
not
invalid
because
of
federal
pre-emption.
do
you
understand
that
that
is
what
their
position
is?
unknown
speaker
do
you
make
out
of
that
that
the
united
states
is
also
suggesting
that
you
could
treat
these
illegal
residents
or
these
people
who...
you
could
treat
them
as
legal
residents?
unknown
speaker
the
united
states
says
that
you
can
do...
at
least
you
can
do
some
things
without
worrying
about
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true
that
before
the
statute
was
passed
you
received
federal
funds
based
in
part
on
the
enrollment
which
included
illegal,
undocumented
children?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
the
percentage,
you
did
get
some
federal
money
which
was
more
because
of
the
larger
enrollment
attributable
to
these
people,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
pretty
hard
to
say
that
the
federal
government
has
some
rule
against
them
being
there
when
it
actually
paid
you
money
because
they
were
there.
unknown
speaker
for
the
family
to
be
there.
correct.
unknown
speaker
does
texas
permit
illegal
aliens
to
own
real
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
recognize
their
titles
when
they
come
across
and
manage
to
remain
undiscovered,
or
even
if
they
are
discovered,
if
nothing
is
done
about
them?
suppose
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
you
say
to
ins,
here
are
a
dozen
illegal
aliens,
why
don't
you
deport
them
and
have
them
take
their
children
with
them?
and
they
say,
sorry,
we
are
too
busy.
and
those
dozen
people
buy
property.
and
i
suppose
there
are
a
good
many
illegal
aliens
who
aren't
destitute.
unknown
speaker
yes,
they
own
a
good
deal
of
real
estate.
you
don't
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
although
it
is
your
law
that...
with
respect
to
property,
i
suppose.
do
you
give
them
driver's
licenses?
unknown
speaker
can
they
lawfully
obtain
a
driver's
license
from
texas?
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
and
they
certainly
can
buy
cars,
though,
can't
they?
unknown
speaker
could
texas
deny
them
fire
protection?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
f-i-r-e.
unknown
speaker
could
texas
pass
a
law
and
say
they
cannot
be
protected?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
if
they
could
do
this,
why
couldn't
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
somebody's
house
is
more
important
than
his
child.
aren't
they
here
at
their
peril?
unknown
speaker
aren't
they
here
at
their
peril?
they
take
all
the
risks,
no
protection
from
the
government,
if
they
want
to
come
here
illegally?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
denying
them
all
rights
that
every
other
similarly
situated
person
has,
such
as
fire
protection,
police
protection,
garbage
collection,
things
like
that.
you
could
take
all
those
things
away,
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
state's
argument.
unknown
speaker
let
me
suggest
this.
if
a
virginian
went
to
texas
to
spend
a
year,
but
had
no
intention
of
becoming
a
domiciliary
of
texas,
would
you
allow
him
or
her
to
attend
a
texas
public
school
for
free?
unknown
speaker
no,
let's
say
six
months.
let's
say
six
months.
unknown
speaker
let's
say
six
months.
to
make
it
realistic,
let's
say
six
months,
for
one
term.
would
you
allow
the
virginian
to
go
to
the
university
of
texas
tuition-free?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
a
one-year
rule
such
as
virginia
does,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
would
you
hazard
a
guess
as
to
whether
if
one
came
to
virginia
from
texas,
and
his
house
was
on
fire
three
days
after
he
arrived,
that
virginia
would
have
any
obligation
to
put
the
fire
out?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
texas
have
a
non-resident
tuition?
unknown
speaker
what
is
a
non-resident?
unknown
speaker
somebody
who...
if
somebody
can
acquire
a
residence
in
a
day,
whenever
they
come
to
the
university,
they
become
a
resident
immediately,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
or
not?
if
there
is
a
non-resident
tuition,
it
means
that
it
is
not
enough
just
to
be
there.
you
are
going
to
have
to
pay
tuition
as
a
non-resident.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hardy,
before
you
sit
down,
please,
how
do
you
compare
the
children
of
the
undocumented
or
illegal
alien
with
the
illegitimate
children
that
the
court
considered
in
lalli?
the
children
themselves
have
a
status
over
which
they
have
no
control,
the
children
of
these
illegal
aliens.
does
the
texas
statute
then
punish
these
children
for
something
over
which
they
have
absolutely
no
control?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
equal
protection
clause
applies
to
these
children,
then
how
do
we
deal
with
the
question
of
these
children
with
relation
to
children
such
as
illegitimate
children?
do
we
have
to
apply
then
a
heightened...
standard
if
equal
protection
applies?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
it
is
unfair
to
you,
i
suppose,
but
it
demonstrates
the
interest
of
the
court.
we
don't
charge
the
question
time
to
your
time,
counsel,
so
you
can
proceed
on
that
theory.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
we
tend
to
confuse
the
situation
when
we
ask
about
university
tuition
charges.
suppose
we
have
mr.
justice
powell's
virginian
going
down
to
the
university
of
texas
as
a
visiting
professor,
but
he
has
three
elementary
school
children.
he
is
going
to
be
there
for
six
months.
do
you
let
them
into
your
public
schools?
unknown
speaker
do
you
charge
them
for
it?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
doesn't
intend
to
stay
there.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
making
the
distinction
between
the
american
citizen
from
virginia
and
the
mexican
american...
or
the
mexican
citizen.
unknown
speaker
so
if
he
were
a
visiting
professor
from
the
university
of
mexico
in
mexico
city,
you
would
have
no
problem?
unknown
speaker
does
your
argument
come
down
to
the
proposition
of
whether
the
person
is
legally
or
illegally
in
the
state?
is
it
not
that
simple?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
states
under
a
long
line
of
decisions
are
prohibited
under
all
but
the
most
narrow
circumstances
from
prohibiting
migration
from
one
state
to
another
within
the
united
states,
so
that
texas
can't
fence
off
its
borders
to
louisianans
or...
whether
they
be
aliens
or
citizens
or
anything
else.
you
are
saying,
aren't
you,
that
the
difference
is
that
this
is
a
foreign
country.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hardy,
one
last
question
so
far
as
i
am
concerned.
unknown
speaker
could
texas
pass
a
law
denying
admission
to
the
schools
of
children
of
convicts?
how
about
escaped
convicts?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
we
are
dealing
with
children.
i
mean
here
is
a
child
that
is
the
son
of
a
murderer,
but
he
can
go
to
school,
but
the
child
that
is
the
son
of
an
unfortunate
alien
cannot?
unknown
speaker
who
even
pays
his
taxes.
the
aliens,
you
know,
they
pay
taxes,
too.
unknown
speaker
isn't
your
point
the
alien
point
only?
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
unknown
speaker
i
have
great
problems
with
who
has
got
accurate
figures
as
to
aliens.
i
mean,
do
aliens
register?
no.
unknown
speaker
are
they
known?
no.
what
is
this,
a
guess?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
most
texas
school
districts,
when
you
come
for
your
kindergarten
or
first
grade
or
whatever
it
is,
ask
you
to
fill
out
a
simple
form
asking
where
you
were
born
and
what
country
you
are
a
citizen
of?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
arguing
in
the
district
court
now.
this
is
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
of
the
tyler
school
district?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
a
border--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
suggesting
they
get
these
slips
filled
out
and
use
them
to
get
federal
funds
but
do
not
admit
those
children?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
true
in
the
school
district
or
districts
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
recruiters?
unknown
speaker
recruiters
for
what?
unknown
speaker
recruiters
for
what?
unknown
speaker
was
there
testimony
that
any
of
these
recruiters
were
from
the
tyler
school
district?
unknown
speaker
dallas
is
a
considerable
distance
from
tyler.
unknown
speaker
dallas
is
a
considerable
distance
from
tyler.
there
must
be
several
school
districts
in
between.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
there
must
be
several
school
districts
in
between.
unknown
speaker
i
am
having
difficulty
seeing
what
your
observations
have
to
do
with
this
case.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
person
illegally
in
the
state
of
texas
and
in
the
united
states
is...
must
be
granted
these
services.
what
they
do
in
these
other
areas
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
you
characterize
it?
unknown
speaker
you
refer
to
her
as
documentable.
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
had
this
been
done
at
the
time
of
trial?
unknown
speaker
your
time
is
running.
isn't
your
basic
position
that
in
any
event,
however
here,
even
though
admitted
illegally,
these
children
are
persons
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
entitled
to
protection
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
that
that
has
been
denied
them,
and
that
this
statute
doesn't
satisfy
whatever
the
standard
may
be
of
state
interest?
isn't
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
going
to
argue
it?
i
haven't
heard
a
word
on
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schey,
would
you
concede
that
it
would
be
possible,
assuming
the
equal
protection
clause
applied,
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
state
to
provide
its
public
school
education
only
to
domiciliaries
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
would
concede
that
that
is
possible.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
can
a
child
of
an
alien
who
has
no
authority
to
be
in
the
united
states
of
any
kind,
and
the
child
is
not
born
here,
can
that
child
become
a
domiciliary?
unknown
speaker
under
texas
law.
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
could
a
state
legitimately
have
laws
that
would
prevent
such
a
person
from
becoming
a
domiciliary
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
you
are
now
getting
into
your
colleague's
time,
counsel.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
not
legal
residents
or
legally
authorized
aliens
in
this
country?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
explanation
for
the
parents'
continued
stay
in
the
country
unmolested
by
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
a
tacit
or
unexpressed
federal
policy
that
these
people
should
remain
in
the
country
undisturbed?
unknown
speaker
is
there
something
in
the
record
to
support
that?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
finding
by
the
courts
or
not?
unknown
speaker
in
what
case?
unknown
speaker
just
tell
me
the
number.
unknown
speaker
1934?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
finding?
unknown
speaker
so
they
are
de
facto
legally
resident
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
is
the
finding?
unknown
speaker
but
can
any
person
who
is
here
in
violation
of
an
act
of
congress
be
a
de
facto
legal
resident
if
the
act
of
congress
says
he
is
not
a
legal
resident?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
would
it
be
contrary
to
federal
law
if
state
authorities
when
they
found
aliens
who
were
illegally
in
the
country
to
escort
them
to
the
border
and
tell
them
to
go
home?
is
that
contrary
to
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
some
case
that
says
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
was
a
state
law.
that
was
a
state
law.
but
suppose
just
as
a
self-help
matter,
the
state
escorted
people
to
the
border.
do
you
think
that
is
contrary
to...
they
would
have
no
authority
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
posse
comitatus,
where
a
judge
is
theoretically,
he
may
have
difficulty
doing
it,
but
he
is
entitled
to
call
upon
bystanders
to
enforce
an
order
of
a
court.
wouldn't
the
people
escorting
these
people
to
the
border
be
much
like
a
posse
comitatus?
they
are
not
officially
endowed
with
status,
but
they
are
helping
to
enforce
a
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
decanas?
unknown
speaker
what
about
our
employment
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
just
talking
pre-emption.
that
is
all
you
were
talking
just
a
moment
ago.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
purpose
is
to
deter
coming
to
this
country?
what
about
decanas?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
if
the
state
of
texas
passed
a
law
that
said
aliens
illegally
in
the
country
may
not
be
employed,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it
isn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
federal
government
has
a
law
against
illegally
entering
the
country,
a
criminally
law,
illegally
entering
the
country.
and
they
budget
a
lot
of
money
to
keep
people
out.
now,
a
state
says,
we
would
like
to
held
the
federal
government
do
that,
just
like...
just
in
the
same
way
you
said
they
could
supplement
the
federal
with
respect
to
employment.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roos,
why
don't
you
use
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
one
of
your
responses?
well,
i
am
asking
him
about
pre-emption.
i
am
not
asking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment--
--i
haven't
heard
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
or
not
this
is
a
person
yet,
and
this
is
about
five
minutes
from
the
end
of
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
two
minutes.
unknown
speaker
i
think
some
time
we
ought
to
get
an
argument
on
whether
or
not
these
children
are
persons
within
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
you
are
on
your
own.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
mine.
i
bet
you
even
money
some
others
are
interested
in
that
point.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
representative
bingham's
comments
throughout
those
debates
were
consistent
with
one
another?
unknown
speaker
consistent
with
one
another?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
the
congressional
vote,
too.
unknown
speaker
if
texas
is
giving...
is
required
to
give
free
bilingual
education
to
all
the
illegals
who
want
to
come
to
the
united
states
from
mexico,
which
they
apparently
can
do
almost
without
any
limit
or
hindrance,
does
that
tend
to
encourage
or
discourage
the
continuance
of
this
illegal
migration
north?
unknown
speaker
what
evidence?
unknown
speaker
what
evidence
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roos--
--mr.
roos--
--after
you,
justice
brennan.
after
you.
go
on.
is
the
question
of
domicile
a
matter
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
what
did
this
court
hold
in
elkins
against
moreno?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
is
it
a
question
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roos,
are
you
arguing
that
even
if
this
statute
were
to
be
regarded
as
implementing
a
federal
policy
to
exclude
illegal
aliens,
even
so
regarded,
that
nevertheless,
you
are
entitled
to
a
holding
that
the
equal
protection
clause
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional,
even
if
it
is
implementing
of
a
federal
policy?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
take
my
hypothetical.
not
if
there
were.
assume
that
there
is
an
express
federal
policy,
and
that
this
statute
implements
that
policy.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
my
question,
mr.
roos.
my
question
is,
if
the
federal
policy
is
to
exclude
illegal
aliens
from
the
united
states,
and
this
statute
is
to
be
regarded
as
implementing
that
federal
policy,
are
you
arguing
that
nevertheless
the
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roos,
this
is
why
i
have
been
trying
to
get
in
here.
it
seems
to
me
that,
or
else
i
am
confused,
that
just
what
mr.
justice
brennan
has
asked
you
is
driving
you
from
any
pre-emption
argument
into
the
equal
protection
argument.
aren't
you
confronted
flatly
with
the
decanas
case?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
avoid
it?
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
distinguish
decanas
then
by
restricting
it
to
the
employment
field?
unknown
speaker
and
on
that
basis,
you
are
not
to
be
driven
off
your
pre-emption
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roos,
let
me
interrupt
you
to
ask
a
refinement
of
justice
brennan's
question.
you
answered,
when
he
said,
supposing
that
the
state
statute
implements
the
federal
policy
of
keeping
aliens,
unlawfully
admitted
aliens
out,
you
said
you
would
nevertheless
make
the
equal
protection
claim.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
you...
if
it
were
demonstrated
that
the
state
statute
substantially
implements
the
federal
policy,
not
just
theoretically
or
minimally,
but
if
it
could
be
shown
that
there
is
a
substantial
deterrent
as
a
result
of
a
state
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
policy
that
i
think...
at
least
i
understood
justice
brennan
to
refer
to
is
the
policy
to
keep
aliens
out
unless
they
are
lawfully
admitted,
which
is
clearly
a
valid
federal
policy.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about...
if
this
statute,
just
denying
them
an
education,
substantially
furthered
that
federal
policy,
would
you
say
that
still
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection?
you
can
just
say
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i
take
it
then
you
would
say
that
if
congress
passed
a
law
saying,
pursuant
to
our
power
to
control
immigration
and
naturalization,
we
hereby
forbid
states
to
offer
education
to
illegal
alien
persons,
people
who
are
here
illegally,
would
you
say
that
would
violate
equal
protection?
would
it
be
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
that
can
be
yes
or
no,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
that
one?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
not
if
a
state.
the
federal
government
passes
a
law
that
says
no
illegal
aliens
shall
be
educated
by
the
states.
would
that
violate
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
you
spoke
a
while
ago
of
a
15-year-old
who
came
to
the
country
when
he
was
six.
is
texas
required
to
grant
him
admission
to
all
its
state
universities
and
graduate
schools
as
a
resident,
or
could
they
charge
him
non-resident
tuition?
unknown
speaker
illegal,
now.
unknown
speaker
he
is
illegally
in
the
country.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
yes
or
no,
too,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
asking
about
university,
undergraduate
and
graduate
schools.
if
they
charge
non-residents
of
texas
three
times
as
much
as
residents
of
texas
to
make
the
stakes
high,
must
they
admit
this
illegal
on
a
texas
residence
rate?
unknown
speaker
the
state
purpose
is
already
there.
many
states
charge
non-residents,
have
a
resident
tuition
fee
and
another.
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
using
illegal
alienage?
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
an
alienage
case.
it
is
an
illegal
presence
case.
unknown
speaker
prior
protection.
due
process.
we
are
just
talking...
my
question
is,
narrowly,
tuition
at
the
university
of
texas
and
the
texas
medical
school.
must
the
state
of
texas
give
him
or
her
residence
tuition
instead
of
three
times,
if
that
were
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roos,
isn't
texas
somewhat
caught
in
a
bind
here
between
the
federal
education
policy
which
affords
funding
for
bilingual
education
and
the
federal
immigration
policy
which
renders
these
people
illegally
present
in
the
united
states,
and
therefore
in
texas,
as
one
of
the
states?
what
is
texas
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
texas
and
california
are
free
to
follow
two
different
policies
on
the
matter,
are
they
not,
unless
they
violate
an
act
of
congress
or
a
provision
of
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
mr.
arnett,
would
you
concede
that
there
are
children
who
were
not
legally
admitted
to
the
united
states
but
which
later
obtain
a
status
that
would
entitle
them
to
remain
as
residents,
and
that
the
texas
statute
would
preclude
those
children
from
being
in
school
tuition-free?
unknown
speaker
but
the
texas
statute
as
it
is
written
applies
to
exclude
those
who
are--
unknown
speaker
--is
this
just
a
matter
of
application
in
the
school
districts,
or
do
we
have
a
texas
decision?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
adopted
now?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
policy
is
that
until
you
are
documented
or
have
some
basis
for
being
here
legally,
that
no
one
can
acquire
either
domicile
or
this
quasi-residence.
unknown
speaker
but
constitutional
rights
are
individual
rights
and
are
not
permitted
to
depend
on
intuition
or
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
mckay
versus
santa
fe
and
topeka
railroad
40
or
50
years
ago
said
just
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
still
the
law.
it
is
an
individual
right.
unknown
speaker
general
arnett,
i
didn't
understand
one
thing
you
said.
you
said
that
as
a
matter
of
state
construction
of
its
own
statutes,
state
law,
that
a
person
not
lawfully
here
was
not
a
resident
within
the
meaning
of
the
laws
governing
school
attendance.
if
that
were
so,
why
did
they
need
this
1975
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
just
the
statute
in
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
it
intended...
it
was
a
reaction
to
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
