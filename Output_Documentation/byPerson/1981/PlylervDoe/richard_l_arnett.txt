mr.
richard
l.
arnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
questions
before
this
court
today
may
and
indeed
based
on
the
last
year's
experience
will
dramatically
affect
the
future
of
the
state
of
texas
and
some
of
its
school
districts.
texas
sits
geographically
right
on
top
of
the
hub
of
mexico's
population,
in
contrast
to
california,
where
the
bordering
state
of
mexico
has
a
population...
had
a
population
of
one
million
in
1970.
the
four
mexican
states
bordering
texas
had
populations
of
six
million.
it
is
approximately
one-third
as
far
to
brownsville
from
mexico
city
as
it
is
to
san
diego.
when
one
considers
the
problem
of
familial
migration
into
this
country,
it
seems
reasonably
clear
that
texas
is
indeed
the
state
which
will
be
most
dramatically
impacted
by
this
type
of
illegal
migration.
when
one
considers
the
fact
that
mexico's
population
is
doubling
approximately
every
20
years,
and
that
approximately
four
and
a
half
million
children
of
school
age
are
out
of
school
in
mexico
right
now
because
of
lack
of
adequate
facilities,
it
doesn't
take
a
great
deal
of
imagination
to
understand
the
texas
legislature's
concerns
for
the
future.
with
the
federal
government
doing
very
little
to
control
the
problem
other
than
to
deny
its
largess
to
illegal
aliens,
and
i
use
that
term
because
it
does
describe
the
people
that
texas
seeks
to
exclude
from
its
schools,
persons
who
are
illegally
present
in
the
country,
but
as
i
say,
with
the
federal
government
doing
very
little,
nothing
at
all
realistically,
to
help
the
impacted
school
districts
in
providing
a
basic
program
of
education
to
their
residents,
be
them
legal
or
illegal
presently,
the
texas
legislature
enacted
section
21031
of
the
texas
education
code
in
1975
to
curtail
the
drain
of
the
state's
educational
resources
and
those
of
its
districts,
which
drain
only
promised
to
increase
in
the
future.
now,
section
21031
basically
codifies
two
distinct
provisions.
one
denies
state
funding
on
the
basis
of
the
attendance
of
pupils
who
are
not
lawfully
admitted
into
the
state.
the
other
exempts
from
the
requirement
for
tuition-free
admission
that
is
imposed
upon
the
districts
those
children
who
are
not
lawfully
admitted
into
the
united
states.
those
two
provisions
conceivably
could
differ
in
result
in
this
case.
the
latter,
not
requiring
school
districts
to
admit
them,
in
essence
leaves
it
at
the
discretion
of
local
districts
to
review
their
circumstances.
now,
we
have
raised
the
issue,
and
it
has
been
invited
certainly
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
consistent
language
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
concerning
whether
illegal
aliens
are
in
fact
protected
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
concerns
rest
more
with
the
manner
of
the
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause
than
they
do
the
application
alone.
texas
has
no
interest
in
legislating
in
an
irrational
manner.
however,
texas
is
very
interested
in
having
their
legitimate
interests
recognized
by
this
court,
and
in
the
event
that
they
are,
we
see
no
problems
with
that.
it
largely...
the
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause
largely
presents
a
policy
issue.
we
don't
really
have
too
much
to
add
to
what
we
have
put
in
our
brief
on
that
point,
and
with
the
limited
time
we
have
here
today,
we
would
like
to
address
the
manner
of
any
application,
as
well
as
the
underlying
state
interests
at
issue
here.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
you
may
have
eighth
amendment
problems,
it
would
seem
to
me,
your
honor.
certainly
were
the
equal
protection
clause
not
applicable,
and
i
might
add
that
we
have
restricted
our
argument
in
that
respect
to
governmental
services;
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
the
one
area
which
may
do
the
most...
may
cause
the
most
judicial
interference
with
political
decisions
in
this
area.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
due
process
clause
in
that
respect
may
be
read
to
answer
the
problem
that
justice
blackmun
posed
as
well
as
that
which
is
also
posed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
but
in
addressing
the
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
first
thing
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
is
the
nature
of
the
class
at
issue.
one
of
the
intimations
and
accusations
in
this
case
that
i
would
like
to
dispel
immediately
is
that
this
statute
embodies
any
racial
animus.
this
whole
case
originated
in
1975,
when
a
district
on
the
border,
eagle
pass,
which
has
a
95-percent
mexican
american
population,
decided
to
enact
a
policy
precluding
illegal
aliens
from
admission
into
their
schools.
the
attorney
general
of
texas
was
asked
for
his
opinion
as
to
the
legality
of
that.
the
response
was
that
under
our
statutes
existing
at
that
time,
all
residents
of
any
classification,
of
any
status
had
a
right
to
go
to
school.
within
a
month,
a
brownsville
legislature...
legislator,
and
brownsville
has
a
90-percent
mexican
american
student
population,
offered
an
amendment
to
a
pending
bill
which
resulted
in
section
21031.
brownsville
and
the
valley
districts
are
the
only
districts
to
have
filed
amicus
briefs
in
this
case.
they
have
representatives
here
today.
they
have
also
suffered
a
700-percent
increase
in
the
last
year
in
illegal
alien
enrollment.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
protect
the
mexican
american
population's
education
in
texas.
it
is
not
to
discriminate
against
them.
when
one
looks
at
the
class,
and
indeed,
when
one
looks
at
the
entire
area
of
equal
protection
as
applied
to
illegal
aliens,
the
first
thing
we
see
is
the
decanas
case.
now,
admittedly,
equal
protection
was
not
directly
before
the
court,
but
i
think
several
commentators
have
noticed
that
the
language
of
the
court
in
talking
about
the
state's
interest
as
well
as
the
rights
of
illegal
aliens
in
that
context
are
very
easily
transferrable
into
equal
protection
terms,
and
indeed,
when
one
compares
decanas
with
truax
versus
raich,
it
reaches
entirely
the
opposite
result.
truax
didn't
even
involve
the
total
denial
of
employment.
decanas
seemingly
allows
that.
at
the
same
time
that
truax
was
decided,
the
doctrine
at
that
time
was
that
the
governments,
the
state
governments
could
protect
their
resources
from
legal
aliens.
that
has
been
obviously
substantially
altered
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
the
dichotomy
between
employment
in
truax
and
the
government
resources
in
truax
would
seem
to
make
our
case
much
stronger
here
than
that
of
california
in
decanas.
in
determining
what
class
we
are
looking
at,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
trial
court
in
texas
versus
certain
named
and
unnamed
undocumented
alien
children
defined
the
class
to
be
all
children
who
are
or
will
be
excluded
from
texas
schools.
he
thus
included
in
that
class
numerous,
in
fact,
who
knows
how
many...
we
feel
that
it
may
be
a
disastrous
number
in
the
future...
children
that
lived...
were
currently
and
are
currently
living
in
mexico.
the
effect
of
the
lower
court's
decision
is
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
cross
the
border,
and
this
is
not
a
border
like
going
through
customs,
when
you
come
into
the
united
states
on
an
airplane.
this
is
a
border
that
is
very
easily
walked
across,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
walk
in
and
you
will
have
your
rights.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
areas
where
the
river
is
shallow
enough
that
indeed
people
walk
across
the
river.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
sir,
if
you
stood
there
and
watched,
i
understand
that
you
can
see
quite
a
flow.
indeed,
the
border
is
largely
unregulated.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no
question.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
we
do
have
that
qualification.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
that's
right.
the
problem
would
be
people
moving
into
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
your
honor,
although
the
problems
in
enforcing
that...
that
provision
of
the
code,
which
is
21031(d),
are
profound
for
the
border
districts,
and
certainly
it
aids
in
the
enforcement
of
that
regulation
as
well,
these
other
sections
that
are
at
issue
here,
but
we
do
have
a
statutory
prohibition
that
technically
covers
that.
our
problems
stem
from
the
fact
that
all
parties
agree
that
about
90
percent
of
the
illegal
aliens
in
this
country
don't
bring
their
families,
but
with
mexico
so
close
to
texas,
and
with
mexico's
situation
as
we
see
it
deteriorating,
we
are
very
much
afraid
that
cases
like
this
involving
the
right
particularly
to
education,
which
is...
we
agree
wholeheartedly
that
education
is
extremely
important,
important
to
our
residents
as
well,
and
we
feel
like
that
the
trend
may
well
be
reversed
in
texas,
that
in
fact
many
more
may
bring
their
children
in.
i
think--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--that
question
somewhat
is
analogous
to
the
question
in
toll
versus
moreno,
and
i
think
that
one
could
take
the
texas
legislature's
decision
in
this
regard
as
being
a
judgment
that
one
legally
not
present
in
the
state
is
not
entitled
to
establish
a
domicile.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
had
that
interpretation
addressed
by
our
courts,
so
for
purposes
of
argument
here,
i
am
not
really
in
a
position
to
give
the
court
an
authoritative
construction
of
texas
law,
because
it
hasn't
been
made
by
our
courts.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
there
really
is
one
overriding
state
objective,
and
that
is
the
preservation
of
the
educational
resources
of
the
state
as
well
as
those
of
the
districts.
certainly
there
are...
the
problem
is
localized
within
texas.
brownsville
has
an
extremely
much
more
difficult
problem
than
el
paso
does,
due
to
the
differing
nature
of
the
border
city
in
mexico.
as
i
say,
brownsville
has
had
a
700-percent
increase
in
one
year.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
there
are
various
references
in
the
record
to
that
in
our
briefs.
certainly
they
are
subject...
the
property
they
live
in
is
subject
to
taxation.
now,
whether
they
in
fact
add
to
the
taxable
resources
of
the
school
district,
we
don't
think
they
do.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
sales
taxes,
but
our
sales
tax
exempts
necessaries,
so
as
i
note
in
our
brief,
it
really
involves
a
great
deal
of
questions
upon
which
there
is
very
little
evidence
in
terms
of
trying
to
determine
whether
there
is
a...
what
the
correlation
is
between
taxes
and
benefits.
concerning
our
interests,
the
one
interest
that
texas
asserts
here
which
we
have
predictably
met
with
opposition
on
as
to
whether
that
is
permissible
is
that
as
a
subsidiary
to
protecting
our
resources,
we
would
like
to
reduce
the
incentive
for
illegal
immigration,
particularly
of
families
and
of
school
aged
children.
it
has
been
said
that
we
don't
have
a
permissible
interest
in
that
regard.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court's
language
in
meyer
versus
roe,
that
the
state
has
legitimate
demographic
concerns
about
the
rate
of
its
population
growth,
and
that
such
concerns
are
basic
to
the
future
of
the
state,
dispels
with
that.
it
also
seems
to
me
that
the
court's
opinion
in
sosna
versus
iowa,
which
talked
about
the
interests
of
iowa
and
not
having
an
invasion
for
a
divorce
mill
type
of
effect
supports
that.
hines
versus
davidowitz,
citing
thomas
jefferson,
to
the
effect
that
the
states,
whatever
concerns
the
states
alone
was
left
to
them;
what
concerns
the
nation
as
a
whole
was
left
to
the
nation.
in
our
case,
this
problem
concerns
texas
far
disproportionately
to
any
other
state
in
the
country.
we
have
two
senators
in
this
nation.
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
much
done
about
it.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
your
honor,
the
testimony
in
this
trial
was
that
the
federal
authorities
get
vastly
more
references,
vastly
more
complaints
of
illegal
aliens
than
they
are
able
to
handle,
and
the
purpose
of--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--well,
what
you
do...
what
we
did
do
is
require
documentation
for
admission.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
and
we
used
those
persons
that
came
in
after
the
court's
order
when
we
talk
about
the
10,000
figure,
and
incidentally,
those
10,000
may
well
not
have
been
here
at
the
time
of
the
court's
order.
one
month
is
plenty
of
time
for
a
lot
of
people
to
cross
the
border.
as
far
as
whether
we
could
reasonably
expect
ins
to
deport
them,
we
think
not.
the
evidence
in
this
record
is
that
ins
gets
complaints
from
citizens
all
the
time
that
they
don't
follow,
including
addresses.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
your
honor--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--your
honor,
ins
apparently
doesn't
pay
much...
ins
is
so
underfunded,
it
is
not
ins's
problem.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
we
feel.
we
feel
like
it
is
clear
that
this
statute
being
on
the
books
prevents
a
substantial
number
of
these
children
from
coming
in.
houston
has
increased
60
percent
in
one
year;
as
i
have
noted
before,
brownsville
700
percent;
another
district
it
is
100
percent.
it
is
clear
that
children
are
coming
in
to
take
advantage
of
the
education.
that
is
the
problem.
the
problem
is
not
the
kids
that
are
here.
the
problem
is
the
future.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
they
don't
bring
their
families,
your
honor.
it
is
not
that
they
don't
have
them.
they
have
them
in
mexico.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
about
half
of
them
are
married.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
that
poses
problems,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
there
are
problems.
don't
get
me
wrong.
there
are
problems
resulting
from
the
children
enrolled
a
month
after
the
order,
and
mr.
hardy
will
address
some
of
those
problems
in
the
perspective
of
the
school
district.
but
the
real
serious
problem
from
the
state's
point
of
view
is
the
ease
with
which
people
can
cross
the
border
and
the
incentive
that
this
causes
for
further
migration,
and
as
we
say,
if
the
standard
of
review
was
that
we
had
to
prove
that
this
offered
an
incentive,
we
can
prove
it
now.
after
a
year,
we
can
show
the
increase.
and
the
problem
is
one
in
looking
toward
the
future.
we
have
to
plan
for
a
long
ways
in
the
future
as
a
state,
and
it
is
not
the
10,000
that
are
here
that
are...
it
was
not
the
182
that
enrolled
in
brownsville
one
month
after
the
decision.
it
is
the
1,300,
1,500
that
are
there
now
that
are
causing
serious
problems.
that
is
my
point.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
if
you
accept
the
arguments
of
the
other
side,
that
we
are
infringing
upon
a
fundamental
right,
or
this
is
a
suspect
class,
or
that
the
state
has
no
interest
whatsoever
in
this
matter,
then
how
could
a
statute
or
a
rule
which
required
us
to
have
the
districts
ask
for
documentation
and
turn
them
over
to
the
ins
be
constitutional?
that
statute
would
promote
exactly
the
same
interests
that
this
statute
promotes.
it
would
be
a
lot
less
effective.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
i
don't
have
time
to
answer
all
the
misrepresentations
and
if
not
direct,
implied,
concerning
the
record.
the...
texas
gets
25
percent
of
the
migrant
funds.
texas
gets
far
more
than
25
percent
of
the
migrant
pupils,
legal
pupils
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
agree
that
they
can
gain
the
status
at
a
later
date.
when
they
gain
that
status,
they
will
be
entitled
to
go
to
school.
furthermore--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--that
has
been
construed
to
mean
legally
present.
the
school
districts
construe
that
to
mean,
if
they
are
legally
living
here.
and
i
might
note
that
the
example
of
the
particular
children
involved,
those
children
never
went
through
the
hearing
process
of
the
state
board
of
education
to
determine
their
entitlement,
notwithstanding
any
lack
of
documentation
they
may
have
if
they
were
in
the
process
of
application.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
we
were
proposing
regulations
on
it
at
the
time
we
were
enjoined
from--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--no,
your
honor,
but
they
can
be
adopted
very
easily,
as
soon
as
we
are
not
enjoined
and
it
becomes
meaningful.
i
would
like
to
address
the
point
you
asked
about
the
innocent
children,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
dandridge,
in
lalli,
in
matthews
versus
lucas,
all
of
those
cases
affected
the
right
of
children
on
the
basis
of
the
parents'
conduct.
in
fact,
this
case
is
much
less
reprehensible,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
than
those,
because
here
the
parents'
conduct
is
now.
the
parents
are
free
to
effect
the
conduct
in
question
at
this
time.
they
were
not
free
in
lalli
once
they
were
deceased.
they
were
not
free
once
they
were
deceased
in
matthews
versus
lucas.
it
is
clear...
and
indeed,
if
you
take
the
innocent
children
line
of
reasoning,
all
children
are
a
suspect
class
or
heightened
scrutiny
for
purposes
of
residency,
whether
they
be
illegal
aliens
or
not.
our
society
is
somewhat
based
on
the
control
of
parents
over
children,
and
that
differentiates
it
from
trying
to
control
the
acts
of
parents
as
to
themselves
with
the
illegitimacy
through
restriction
on
their
children.
the
other
thing
that
has
come
up
is
domicile
versus
residency,
and
the
reason
that
has
been
somewhat
confused
is,
texas
does
not
require
strict
domicile
to
go
to
school.
we
do
not
require
an
indefinite
intent
to
remain.
we
require
sort
of
quasi-domicile,
and
i
think
that
we
call
it
residence
under
the
statutes.
it
has
been
interpreted
by
our
courts,
and
there
are
several
decisions
on
this
point,
that
it
is
not
as
much
as
domicile,
but
it
is
more
than
simply
staying
overnight,
you
know.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
that
is
exactly
right,
and
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
that
there
was
no
state
court
decision
on
it,
that
is
in
the
domicile
area.
in
the
area
of
residency,
both
the
legislature
and
the
texas
supreme
court
by
denying
the
writ
in
hernandez
and
upholding
the
statute
have
made
the
decision
that
residency
for
school
purposes
cannot
be
illegal,
it
must
be
legal,
and
so
to
that
extent
i
would
say,
yes,
state
law
does
make
that
determination.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
as
to
incentive,
if
it
is
not
an
incentive,
why
has
brownsville
grown
from
182
undocumented
alien
children
one
month
after
the
order
to
over
1,300,
1,400
this
year?
i
would
point
out
that
the
findings
of
the--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--your
honor,
vance
versus
bradley
says
it
is
not
the--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
i
would
point
out
that
vance
versus
bradley
says
it
is
not
the
office
of
findings
of
fact
to
make
conclusions
against
the
legislative
judgment,
and
that
is
exactly
what
was
done
at
the
lower
level
here,
and
furthermore,
all
the
evidence
that
they
are
referring
to
about
it
not
being
incentive
have
to
do
with
adults.
it
is
clearly
an
incentive
for
children.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
all
i
am
saying
is
that
the
statute
makes
that
determination
from
a
legislative
point
of
view,
and
that
has
been
established
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
i
think
that
is
a
legislative
definition.
i
think
it
clearly
is.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
it
was.
