mr.
peter
a.
schey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
follow
up
on
some
of
the
issues
that
the
court
has
already
raised,
and
perhaps
also
clarify
some
factual
questions.
firstly,
the
state
of
texas
seems
to
argue
that
it
is
in
a
highly
unique
situation,
and
they
downplay
the
importance
of
this
problem
to
states
like
california,
et
cetera.
this
court
should
note
that
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record...
immigration
and
naturalization
service
keeps
statistics
on
these
kinds
of
matters...
that
in
fact
the
state
of
california
has
a
much
larger
non-citizen
community
than
does
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
this
is
a
difficult--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--it
is
a
difficult
figure
to
measure.
however,
according
to,
number
one,
apprehension
statistics,
which
are
gathered
by
the
immigration
service,
and
number
two,
numerous,
in
excess
of
hundreds
of
demographic
studies
which
have
been
conducted
both
by
the
department
of
labor,
the
department
of
justice,
the
department
of
state,
they
are
able
to
ascertain
where
the
majority
of
people
are
moving
to,
where
the
majority
of
people
are
living,
where
the
majority
of
people
are
paying
taxes,
et
cetera.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
they
do,
and
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
counsel
for
texas,
the
district
court
specifically
noted
that
those
kinds
of
questions,
the
district
court
opinion
at
page
574,
that
those
kinds
of
questions
to
produce
proof
of
legal
citizenship
in
this
country
are
directly
targeted
against
spanish
surnamed
students
in
the
schools.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
just
as
a
finding
of
fact
and
in
terms
of
what
the
proof
was,
i
merely
raise
it
for
that
reason.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
not
only
did
the
state
of
texas
seek
federal
funding
for
both
bilingual
and
migrant
education
prior
to
1975,
when
they
enacted
this
statute,
but
they
have
continued
to
do
it
since
1975.
in
fact,
the
unequivocal
testimony
and
conceded
in
their
reply
brief
is
that
to
this
day
they
send
out
so-called
migrant
recruiters,
who
go
out
into
the
mexican
communities,
not
just
by
counting
these
people
for
purposes
of
the
census
count,
but
they
actually
send
out
what
they
call
migrant
recruiters
into
the
mexican
communities,
where
they
knock
on
doors,
they
go
to
the...
they
knock
on
residential
homes,
and
they
recruit
undocumented
children,
which
means
they
fill
out
little
pieces
of
paper
which
they
then
send
to
the
federal
government,
and
pursuing
this
way,
they
not
only
gain
a
windfall
by
taxing
the
parents
of
these
children
and
then
not
educating
the
children,
but
they
gain
a
further
windfall
by
submitting
these
pieces
of
paper
to
the
federal
government
and
by
getting
$250
million
per
year.
one
quarter
of
the
total
national
allocation
for
migrant
and
bilingual
education
goes
to
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
true
of
all
the
school
districts.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
true
of
all
the
school
districts
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
precisely.
that
is
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
there
are
three
or
four
witnesses
who
testified
to
that,
including
the
people
themselves
who
are
going
out--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--that
is
correct.
including...
people
testified
in
our
trial
who
went
out
and
were
knocking
on
these
doors
to
fill
out
these
applications.
some
little
church
set
up
a
little
school
where
they
had
maybe
50
undocumented
children
in
one
big
room,
and
these
recruiters
would
come
around
and
fill
out
little
pieces
of
paper.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
just
what
they
call
them.
they
call
them
migrant
recruiters.
they
are
employees
of
the
state--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--excuse
me?
mr.
peter
a.
schey
they
are
simply
recruiting
these
little
pieces
of
paper,
is
what
they
are
really
doing.
that
is
the
title
given
to
them
by
the
state
of
texas.
they
go
out
and
they
complete
little
forms
which
measure
the
total
number
of
migrant
children
and
the
total
number
of
children
needing
bilingual
education
in
the
state.
they
submit
this
to
the
federal
government,
and
the
state
of
texas
alone
ends
up
with
one-quarter
of
the
national
federal
moneys.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
am
not
sure
if
there
was.
we
had
about
five
or
six
different
school
districts
that
were
involved
in
the
consolidated
case.
i
think
that
the
particular
recruiter
who
testified
in
our
case
was
from
the
dallas
independent
school
district,
and
we
called
that
person,
but
also
a
statewide
official
testified
from
the
texas
education
agency.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
am
sorry?
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that's
correct,
but...
that's
correct,
but
this
is
a
state
program,
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
a
statewide
official
testified
that
this
was
happening.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that's
correct,
and
it
apparently
is
happening
in
every
school
district
in
between,
because
it
is
a
statewide
program.
it
is
the
texas
education
agency
that
is
doing
this.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
residency
question
has
raised
many,
many
questions
here.
the
state
has
a
residency
law,
as
they
have
pointed
out.
that
residency
law
worked
fine.
that
residency
law
worked
until
1975.
under
that
residency
law,
people
who
attempted
to
just
come
across
the
border
solely
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
school,
there
is
a
special
provision
within
their
residency
law
that
prevents
people
from
simply
coming
across
the
border
for
the
sole
purpose
of
going
to
school,
and
a
federal
challenge
to
that
statute
was
just
completed
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
that
statute
was
upheld,
so
that
a
child
cannot...
the
name
of
the
case
is
arredondo
versus
brockette,
and
there
is
a
petition
for
cert
pending.
so,
children
cannot
simply
willy-nilly
come
into
the
school,
stay
there
for
a
few
days,
solely
for
the
purpose,
leave
their
parents
behind,
and
attend
school
in
texas.
the
state
of
texas
defines
undocumented
people
as
residents
for
numerous
purposes,
trusts,
wills,
some
criminal
proceedings,
for
the
payment
of
property
taxes,
so
they
have
had
no
trouble...
neither
has
the
federal
government,
for
that
matter,
had
trouble
defining
people
who
are
in
a
questionable
immigration
status,
not
a
lawful,
permanent
status
with
the
green
card.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
characterization
of
the
issue
of
the
case,
which
is
the
way
the
state
of
texas
characterizes
it--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--illegal
aliens,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
that
is
a
term,
that
is
a
term
that
you
can
certainly
read
every
day
of
the
week
on
the
front
page
of
the
washington
post.
it
is
not
a
term
that
you
will
find
on
any
page
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
in
other
words,
the
problem
is,
and
this
court
addressed
fully
this
problem
in
decanas
versus
bica...
let
me
just
explain.
in
decanas
versus
bica,
the
state
of
california
didn't
beat
the
federal
government
to
the
punch.
the
state
of
california
only
excluded
from
employment
those
people
who
the
federal
government
had
already
determined
could
not
work
in
the
state,
and
even
with
that
this
court
was
not
satisfied,
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
finding
of
potential
conflict
with
federal
law.
but
here,
you
have
a
statute
that
every
district
court
judge
that
has
looked
at
it
carefully
and
that
has
examined
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
that
the
state
is
going
to
incorporate
a
federal
concept.
they
have
to
do
it
somewhat
carefully.
that
is
the
notion
of
pre-emption.
and
it
also
ties
into
the
rationality
of
the
statute.
who
precisely
are
they
keeping
out
of
school?
well,
in
this
particular
case
they
keep
out
of
school
"illegal
aliens".
well,
that
term
isn't
used
anywhere
in
the
immigration
or
nationality
act.
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
the
legality
of
a
person's
presence
in
this
country
is
measured
against
deportation
statutes.
the
statute
says
you
cannot
go
to
school
if
you
did
not
enter
the
country
legally,
but
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
of
children
who
did
not
enter
the
country
legally,
yet
they
are
entitled
to
remain
in
the
united
states.
there
are
numerous
statutes,
there
are
numerous
regulations,
and
these
are
all
covered
in
our
brief,
there
are
numerous
policies,
there
are
operation
instructions
which
allow
people
to
remain
here
even
though
they
did
not
enter
"legally"
as
the
district
court
held.
upon
looking
at
this
carefully,
this
particular
statute,
and
its
implementation,
has
been
a
monument
to
ambiguity.
they
really
don't
know
who
they
are
keeping
out
of
school.
let
me
give
you
one
example.
we
had
a
witness
testify
in
our
case,
not
a
plaintiff...
and
none
of
our
plaintiffs
are
under
order
of
deportation;
they
all
entered
illegally,
but
every
single
one
of
them
is
documentable
under
federal
immigration
laws...
aside
from
the
plaintiffs,
we
had
a
witness
testify.
this
witness
entered
the
united
states
at
the
age
of
four
months.
her
father
is
a
united
states
citizen
born
in
texas.
her
mother
is
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
she
has
been
in
the
united
states
for
nine
years.
she
has
attended
school
in
two
states.
this
also
gets
to
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
about
putting
up
a
wall
between
other
states.
she
didn't
come
to
texas
from
mexico.
she
came
to
texas
from,
i
believe,
missouri,
or
new
jersey,
where
she
attended
school
for
two
years.
this
child
will
never
be
deportable
from
this
country.
maybe
the
new
york
times
would
call
her
an
illegal
alien,
but
no
immigration
judge
would
ever
call
her
an
illegal
alien.
no
court
would
ever
authorize
her
deportation.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
means,
your
honor,
that
when
she
gathers
the
necessary
documents,
when
she
gathers
her
mother's
birth
certificate...
her
mother
was
born
in
the
yucatan,
and
she
is
represented
by
an
immigration
counsel,
and
her
immigration
counsel
testified
that
he
had
been
working
for
two
years
trying
to
get
the
mother's
birth
certificate
from
the
yucatan.
then
they
had
to
get
the
father's
birth
certificate
from
texas.
when
they
finally
gather
all
that
preliminary
documentation,
they
can
go
down
to
the
immigration
service
and
begin
the
process
of
documenting
that
child.
we
had
the
ex-commissioner--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--they
were
in
the...
for
two
years
they
had
been
in
the
process
of
gathering
the
preliminary
documentation.
now,
once
they
go
down
to
the
immigration
service,
the
immigration
service
doesn't
do
anything.
they
have
a
thousand
people
show
up
every
morning
filing
these
kinds
of
applications.
they
will
only
give
you
the
kind
of
letter
that
counsel
for
the
state
of
texas
keeps
talking
about.
well,
we
will
let
these
children
in
once
they
get
a
letter
saying
they
are
legally
here.
the
immigration
service
doesn't
give
out
those
kind
of
letters.
what
they
will
do
is,
once
they
have
processed
the
child's
documentation,
they
will
give
that
child
a
green
card,
or
they
may
even
decide
that
this
particular
witness
is
a
derivative
citizen,
and
they
will
then
give
her
citizenship
papers.
the
ex-commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
testified
in
our
trial.
that
process
can
take
anywhere
from
two
to
seven
years,
given
current
backlogs.
he
testified
and
an
immigration
judge
testified
subsequent
to
this
little
child
testifying
that
the
chances
of
this
child
ever
being
deported
were
simply
zero.
so,
we
can
say,
well,
who
does
this
case
involve?
doesn't
it
simply
involve
legal
versus
illegal
aliens?
unfortunately,
it
is
not
that
simple.
here
is
a
little
child
who
had
been
for
two
years
in
a
row,
she
had
gone
and
tried
to
enroll
in
the
texas
public
schools.
she
was
not
allowed
to
enroll,
even
though
she
had
an
immigration
counselor
go
down
to
the
school
with
her.
they
wouldn't
let
her
enroll.
she
is
the
child
of
a
u.
s.
citizen.
this
immigration
counselor
testified
he
had
approximately
200
open
cases
just
like
hers
in
houston
alone.
children
of
united
states
citizens
who
could
not
attend
the
public
schools
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
our
basic
position.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
our
basic
position.
our
basic
position
is
that
regardless
of
a
child's
deportability
or
non-deportability,
in
fact,
none
of
these
children
have
been
established
to
be
deportable,
the
state
has
not
established
any
rational
basis
for
excluding
these
children
from
the
texas
schools.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
and
that
is
precisely
what
happened
in
texas
until
1975.
in
1975,
let
us
assume
that
a
child--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--i
think
it
is
possible.
in
other
words--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--yes,
and
i
believe
texas
law
provides
for
that.
texas--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--under
texas
law.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
the
attorney
general
of
texas
wrote
a
memorandum,
which
is
in
evidence
in
our
trial,
to
that
effect
in
1975,
and
counsel
has
indicated
it
was
in
response
to
that
memo,
partly
in
response
to
that
memo,
that
they
enacted
this
statute.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
is
essentially
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
would,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
think
that
that
is
conceivable.
i
think
that
a
state
law
which
was
carefully
tailored
to
track
federal
immigration
laws
and
policies
as
opposed
to
this
law
where
they
conceded
at
trial
they
hadn't
even
been
in
touch
with
the
immigration
service
for
five
years,
to
update
themselves
on
policy,
but
conceivably
if
they
were
to
carefully
track
immigration
laws,
regulations,
and
policies,
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
i
could
conceive
of.
a
child
is
under
a
final
non-appealable
order
of
deportation.
the
federal
government
has
made
a
judgment
on
that
child
or
that
child's
parents'
ability
to
reside
in
this
country.
i
could...
i
am
not
suggesting
that
from
a...
i
am
not
saying
that
that
would
be
wise
legislation,
but
i
think
conceivably
it
would
be
rational
legislation.
that
is
what
california
has
done.
california
has
a
welfare
and
institutions
code,
11-104,
which--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--thank
you
very
much.
