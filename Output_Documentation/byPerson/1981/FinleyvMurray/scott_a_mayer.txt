mr.
scott
a.
mayer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
you
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
petitioner
should
enjoy
absolute
judicial
immunity
from
section
1983
damages
liability
for
acts
taken
in
discharge
of
his
duties
as
an
aide
to
the
court,
in
order
that
the
court's
judicial
duties
may
be
properly
accomplished.
the
intimate
relationship
between
the
court
clerk
and
the
court
is
clearly
reflected
in
the
record
in
this
case.
petitioner,
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
created
court
procedures
in
order
to
implement
a
general
order
issued
by
the
presiding
judge
of
the
municipal
district
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county.
the
clerk
created
these
court
procedures
in
conjunction
with
the
general
order
in
order
to
notify
the
chicago
police
department
of
warrant
recall
orders,
as
well
as
to
notify
victims
and
witnesses
of
court
dates
when
a
criminal
defendant,
such
as
respondent,
fails
to
appear
in
court
on
the
designated
court
date.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
the
clerk
would
enjoy
absolute
judicial
immunity
only
if
he
was
acting
in
his
capacity
as
clerk
in
order
that
judicial
duties
may
be
properly
accomplished.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
he
would
not
be
absolutely
immune
in
that
situation.
he
would
be
immune
only
if
he
was
acting
pursuant
to
court
order
or
directive,
within
the
scope
of
his
duties
as
the
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
in
this
case,
there
is
no
allegation
of
a
clerk
intentionally
failing
to
communicate
to
the
police
department
an
arrest
recall
warrant.
in
this
case
the
only
allegations
are
against
the
petitioner
as
the
clerk
of
the
court
in
his
official
capacity
in
creating
procedures.
these
procedures,
there
are
no
allegations
that
they
are
unconstitutional,
but
merely
that
those
procedures
were
not
followed
by
one
clerk
who,
by
mistake
or
inadvertence,
inadvertently
failed
to
communicate
the
warrant
recall
to
the
chicago
police
department.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
no,
it
is
not
relevant
whether
or
not
the
duty
is
labeled
discretionary
or
ministerial.
the
relevant
inquiry
is
not
into
that
nature,
but
into
whether
or
not
that
is
a
function
intimately
associated
to
the
court
process.
therefore,
the
question
devolves
not
on
whether
or
not
the
clerk
must
or
must
not...
whether
it's
a
ministerial
or
discretionary
duty,
but
on
the
function.
the
test
is
whether
the
clerk
is
acting
as
an
official
aide
and
whether
he
is
functioning
in
that
capacity
as
clerk,
as
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
in
fact
doing.
in
his
close
association
with
the
presiding
judge,
he
created
procedures.
there
are
no
allegations
against
any
other
clerk
in
this
case.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
the
complaint
on
its
face
alleges
that
the
petitioner
knowingly
implemented
court
procedures,
but
there
are
no
allegations
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
other
than--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--it's
correct
that
that
allegation
is
in
the
complaint.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
even
assuming,
taking
all
facts--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--yes,
that
is
true,
our
position
is
that
he
is
absolutely
immune
as
a
function
of
his
status
as
clerk,
acting
as
clerk
for
the
court.
this
would
be
no
different
than
if
the
respondent
alleged
that
the
judge
in
his
creation
of
procedures
in
his
general
order
knowingly
created
procedures
similar
to
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
he
is,
like
the
judge,
performing
a
function
as
clerk
for
the
court,
in
a
quasi-judicial
capacity,
within
the
scope
of
his
authority,
which
is
admitted
in
the
face
of
the
complaint.
the
complaint
admits
that
this
was
his
duty
as
the
court
clerk,
that
he
created
these
procedures,
and
that
all
that
he
failed
to
do
was
to
create
perfect
procedures.
when
we
discuss
the
question
of
judicial
immunity,
we
are
dealing
with
an
imperfect
world.
that
is
all
that
happened
here.
a
mere
mistake
and
a
mislaid
file
in
the
court's
office,
clerk's
office,
was
at
most
what
caused
the
failure
of
the
recall
warrant
to
be
communicated.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
it
is
irrelevant
whether
or--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--our
position
is
that
the
clerk
would
be
absolutely
immune
in
that
situation,
because
it
is...
the
policy
considerations
behind
allowing...
the
policy
considerations
are
as
follows:
that
court
clerks,
as
judges,
should
be
free
from
allegations
of...
free
from
defending
against
allegations
of
a
1983
complaint
for
acts
that
are
intimately
related
to
the
judicial
process,
whether
or
not
those
acts
are
carried
out.
the
majority
of
circuits
who
have
decided
whether
or
not
clerks
are
absolutely
immune
have
held
that
they
are
as
long
as
the
act
is
pursuant
to
a
court
order
or
directive
or
intimately
related
to
the
process.
even
the
fifth
circuit
in
williams
versus
wood
held
that
without
regard
to
scienter,
which
is
a
factor
that
is
always
taken...
which
is
never
taken
into
consideration
in
a
question
of
immunity
of
judges,
dating
back
to
bradley
versus
fisher.
it
is
irrelevant
because
the
policy
is
that
the
potential
harm
to
deny
absolute
judicial
immunity
from
section
1983
damages
is
greatly
outweighed
by
the
good
to
the
public.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
our
position
is
that
the
absolute
judicial
immunity
enjoyed
by
the
court
clerk...
he
derives
his
status
from
the
court,
but
he...
the
test
for
his
immunity
is
dependent
not
only
on
his
status
from
the
court--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--if
the
clerk
refused
to
follow
the
court
order,
we
would
still
submit
that
he
would
be
absolutely
immune
in
this
case.
it
is
a
question
of
status
and
function.
as
long
as
the
duties
are
performed
in
order
that--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
as
long
as
he
is
an
official,
yes.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
your
honor--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--the
line
should
be
drawn
at
the...
in
this
case,
based
on
the
test
that
is
applied
in
judicial
immunity
cases,
to
stop
when
the
clerk
is...
when
the
person
is
no
longer
acting
as
an
official
aide
of
the
judge
in
order
that
judicial
duties
may
be
properly
accomplished.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
absolute
judicial
immunity
has
been
applied
to
bailiffs
in
courts
where
their
acts--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
because
the
chauffeur
is
not
an
extension
of
the
court
as
the
clerk
is
an
arm
of
the
court.
the
chauffeur
has--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--the
bailiff--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--the
bailiff
acting
as
a
chauffeur--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--is
not
absolutely
immune
from
1983
damages
liability.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
because
he
is
not
acting
as
an
aide
to
the
court.
his
status...
he
is
taken
out
of
the
context
of
the
court.
he
can
be
called
bailiff
or
anything
else,
but
you
look
then
to
what
is
his
conduct,
and
if
his
conduct
as
a
chauffeur
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
court
system,
which
i
assume
it
does
not,
he
would
enjoy
no
immunity
in
his
status
as
a
chauffeur.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
our
position
is
that
in
the
sense
that
a
clerk
is
acting
as
a
judge
he
would
have
derivative
immunity.
in
the
sense
that
the
clerk
acts
as
the
clerk
and
not
the
judge,
he
enjoys
absolute
judicial
immunity
without
regard
to
the
manner
of
performance
of
the
act,
because
we
look
not
to
the
specific
result
of
whether
or
not
the
act
was
accomplished;
we
look
to
what
was
the
function
of
the
clerk
at
the
time.
in
this
case,
the
failure
of
the
warrant
recall
order
to
be
communicated
was
merely
the
result
of
at
most
inadvertence,
and
in
that
case
it
is
no
different
than
in
the
common
law
when
a
court
clerk
failed...
erroneously
entered
an
order
by
the
court.
it
was
as
if
the
clerk
did
not
enter
the
order
at
all,
but
under
the
common
law
the
clerk
did
in
fact
enjoy
immunity
from
damage
liability.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
the
clerk
should
enjoy
absolute...
the
absolute
judicial
immunity,
not
a
qualified
immunity,
because
he
would
be
forced
at
trial
to
defend
against
the
good
faith
acts
of
conduct
that
is
intimately
related
to
the
judicial
process.
the
independence
of
the
judiciary...
this
would
require
the
clerk
to
go
to
court,
to
sit
at
the
defense
table,
to
defend
against
conduct
that
may
in
the
end
turn
out
not
in
fact
to
have
been
the
result
of
negligence,
or
if
even
intentional
conduct.
the
point
is
that
the
court
system
will
be
clogged,
the
judicial
machinery
will
break
down,
if
court
clerks
are
required
to
defend
their
actions
in
court
in
1983
actions.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
court
courts
post
bond
in
their
fiduciary
capacity
as
a
trustee--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--no,
they're
not.
but
the
question
of
bonds
is
a
different
question
from
whether
or
not
the
court
in
a
1983
action
should
be
subject
to
absolute--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--a
clerk
could
be
sued
on
his
bond,
but
he
could
also...
there
are
other
alternative
remedies
that
a
clerk
can
be
sued
on
besides
his
bond.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
because
the
statute...
well,
the
state
statute
can
provide,
as
it
does
in
chapter
25,
section
10,
as
an
alternative
remedy,
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
can...
the
principal
clerk
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
his
subordinates.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
yes,
the
latter
aspect
is
the
purpose
of
the
bond
in
the
state
of
illinois,
for
the
purpose
of...
to
replace
those
moneys
that
are
taken
illegally
by
the
clerk.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
the
clerk
would
be
immune
only
if
he
was
acting
as
an
official
aide
of
the
court
in
order
to
discharge
the
court's
duties.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
the
state
can
legislate
in
this
area,
as
it
has
done
already
in
the
illinois
revised
statutes
in
the
clerk's
act.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
the
clerk
could
have
been
sued
under
state
law.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
under
state
law
today
there
is
a
statute
that
would
provide
that
the
principal
clerk
can
be
sued
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
under
state
law,
the
question
has
not
been
decided
whether
the
clerk
enjoys
judicial
immunity.
but
there
is
a
state
statute
and
there
is
case
authority
that
permits
a
clerk
to
be
sued
in
a
civil
action.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
yes,
for
the
negligence
of
his
deputies.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
well,
the
statute
that
i
referred
to
is
an
available
alternative
remedy
that
has
not
been
tested
that
i
can
tell
in
my
research.
the
statute
is
on
the
books,
but
there
is
a
question
now
raised
by
drury
versus
mclean
county,
which
has
held
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
in
illinois
has
historically
been
a
member
of
the
judiciary
branch.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
it
is
an
open
question
in
illinois.
the
drury
case
did
not--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
the
case--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--well,
the
case
is
an...
the
issue
is
an
open
issue.
my
point
is
only
that
there
is
a
state
statute
that
could
provide
a
remedy
against
the
clerk.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
it
is
not
clear,
other
than
by
the
fact
that
this
statute
exists.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
it
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief.
it's
in
footnote
3
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
that
again
is
that
acting
as
an
official
aide
of
the
judge
in
his
capacity
as
the
clerk,
it
is
not
relevant
whether
the
intended...
whether
the
intended
result
was
accomplished.
the
fact
is
that
the
policy
considerations
require
that
in
order
for
the
judicial
machinery
to
be
able
to
function
with
the
essential
court
officers,
the
clerks...
the
courts
will
be
clogged
with
petitioners
like
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
having
to
go
in
to
defend
against
actions
of
performance
or
non-performance,
it
will
disrupt
the
court
system
to
such
a
degree
that
the
potential
harm
to
deny
absolute
judicial
immunity
must
be
outweighed
by
the
public
good
to
have
clerks
clerking
and
not
sitting
in
courtrooms
defending
against
actions
and
complaints
under
1983
either
for
inaction
or
action.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
our
position
would
be
the
same,
that
an
absolute
judicial
immunity
would
exist
regardless
of
the
intent
or
the
malice
or
the
bad
faith.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
it
is
better
to...
yes.
it
is
better
to
allow
one
corrupt...
a
corrupt
clerk
to
go
free
than
to
have
the
faithful
clerks,
whose
ardor
will
definitely
be
dampened
from
performing
their
faithful
duties
if
a
policy
is
instituted
where
they
can
be
subject
to
liability
for
allegations
of
malice
or
bad
faith
in
a
complaint.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple.
the
clerk
here
is
not
alleged
to
have
done
anything
wrong.
all
he
did
was
create
procedures.
these
procedures
were
intimately--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--yes,
your
honor,
our
petition...
the
question
presented
is
limited
to
whether
or
not
he
should
enjoy
absolute
judicial
immunity
for
acts
taken
in
discharge
of
his
duties
as
an
official
aid
of
the
court,
in
order
that
the
court's
judicial
functions
can
be
properly
accomplished.
and
the
facts
in
this
case
clearly
reflect
that
when
the
clerk,
the
petitioner,
created
these
procedures
he
did
it
with
the
court's
knowledge,
with
the
court's
approval,
under
the
court's
supervision...
clearly
an
act
as
the
clerk
within
his
scope
of
authority
as
the
clerk
of
the
court.
in
this
case,
petitioner
is
clearly
and
should
be
clearly
held
absolutely
immune
for
an
act
that
is
so
intimately
related
and
integrally
related
to
the
judicial
process.
the
1983
cases
in
the
circuits
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue
have
all
held...
the
majority
of
the
cases
that
have
held
that
the
clerks
are
immune
have
held
that
the
clerk
of
the
court's
common
law
immunity
has
not
been
abrogated
by
the
enactment
of
section
1983.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
well,
if...
the
clerk's
immunity
should
still
survive
regardless
of
whether...
in
1983
actions,
the
question
is
whether--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
clerk
is
absolutely
immune
under
1983
is
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
at
common
law
the
clerk
was...
enjoyed
immunity
from
damages
when
sued
when
performing
acts
as
a
clerk
in
discharge
of
his
duties,
regardless...
and
as
the
common
law
establishes,
the
clerk
of
the
court
was
not
amenable
to
suit
when
acting
under
the
direction
and
supervision
of
the
court.
a
presumption
existed
that
when
a
clerk
acted
he
acted
with
the
authority
of
the
court
for
whom
he
acted,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
was
negligent
or
intentional.
now,
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
this
in
the
circuits
have
consistently
held
that
whether
or
not
it
was
a
failure
to
notify
someone
pursuant
to
a
court
order,
whether
it
was
a
failure
to
send
notice
of
a
copy
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
clerk
refused
to
docket
a
particular
piece
of
paper,
the
end
result
was
the
same.
the
analysis
focused
on
whether
or
not
the
clerk
acted
as
an
official
aid
of
the
judge
in
order
that
the
judicial
duties
could
be
properly
accomplished.
and
the
policy
considerations
behind
this
are
clear,
that
if
clerks
are
required
to
defend
their
actions
in
a
federal
court
plaintiffs
will
be
able
to
do
indirectly
what
they
cannot
do
directly.
the
clerk
will
be
the
one
who
will
have
to
go
in
and
defend
against
court
orders
and
court
actions,
which
cannot
be
done
if
the
judge
himself
had
been
sued
under
section
1983.
by
bringing
the
clerk
into
court,
the
court
system
will
be
bogged
down.
in
a
system
like
cook
county,
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
to
have
the
clerk
of
the
court
go
in
and
defend
every
time
a
disgruntled
person
feels
like
filing
a
section
1983
suit
based
upon
conduct
of
the--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
your
honor,
in
this
case
she
was
charged--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--the
clerk
of
the
court
agrees
that
she
is
not
a
disgruntled
person.
in
fact,
it
is
unfortunate
that
what
happened
happened
here.
the
warrant
recall
order
should
have
gotten
to
the
chicago
police
department.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
clear
that
she
was
not
the
victim
of
a
mugging.
she
was
in
fact
initially
charged
as
a
criminal
defendant
for
deceptive
practices,
and
in
this
case
the
respondent--
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
--assuming
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
taken
as
true,
yes,
that
is
correct.
but
even
under
these
set
of
facts,
we
must
go
back
to
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
clearly
reflect
that
the
respondent
acknowledges
that
the
clerk
was
acting
as
an
official
aide
of
the
judge,
acted
in
discharge
of
his
judicial
duties
to
implement
court
orders,
and
that
all
that
the
respondent
seeks
in
this
case
is
that
the
clerk
create
perfect
procedures,
which
are
impossible
in
an
imperfect
world,
where
immunity
recognizes
that
mistakes
will
occur.
and
especially
in
a
large
metropolitan
court
system,
like
the
one
in
circuit
court
of
cook
county
with
2100
deputy
clerks,
6
municipal
districts,
a
likelihood
of
one
mistake
in
a
thousand
like
this
happening
will
happen.
without
judicial
immunity,
the
clerk
should...
would
be
subject
to
having
to
leave
his
duties
and
thus
impair
the
effective
administration
of
justice
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
we
know...
it's
not
relevant
beyond
the
facts
as
they're
stated
on
the
complaint
as
to
what
happened.
we
know
what
happened
as
to
what
the
clerk
did.
the
clerk
created
the
procedures
with
the
court
to
promote
the
efficient
management
of
the
court
system.
whether
or
not
the
clerk
on
the
tenth
floor
mislaid
that
file
intentionally,
negligently,
whether
or
not
the
chicago
police
department
failed
to
execute
their
procedures,
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
the
clerk
is
absolutely
immune
as
an
official
aide,
doing
his
job
to
promote
the
efficient
management
of
the
judiciary.
we
would
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
and
extend
absolute
judicial
immunity
to
court
clerks.
i
would
ask
that
the
remaining
time
i
have
be
reserved.
mr.
scott
a.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
clearly
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
could
have
done
no
more
than
what
he
did
in
creating
the
procedures
in
conjunction
with
the
general
order
in
this
case.
furthermore,
the
courtroom
deputy
in
this
case
followed
each
of
the
procedures
that
was
assigned
to
him
and
there
are
no
allegations
that
the
deputy
clerk
involved
in
this
case
did
not
comply
or
implement
the
procedures.
as
far
as
intentional
violation
of
the
court
orders,
it
is
clear
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
is
amenable
to
alternative
available
remedies
when
he
intentionally
violates
a
court
order.
he
is
subject...
he
is
answerable
to
the
court.
he
is
subject
to
contempt.
he
is
subject
to
removal
from
office,
just
as
well
as
a
judge,
and
in
addition
would
be
subject
to
the
criminal
analogue
of
the
section
1983
act
under
section
242
for
criminal
intentional
violations
of
civil
rights.
the
clerk
would
enjoy
no
greater
immunity
than
a
judge
or
a
prosecutor
would
for
intentional
violations.
furthermore,
it's
clear
that
the
negligent
act
that
occurred
here,
the
mere
inadvertent
mislaying
of
the
warrant
recall
order,
was
something
that
could
not
have
been
prevented
even
with
the
threat
of
the
memo.
mistakes
will
happen
in
a
large
system
such
as
the
one
in
cook
county
and
merely
the
fact
that
this
memo
was
there
was
not
something
that
even
could
prevent
this
one
isolated
incident.
clearly,
the
clerk
is
intimately
related
to
the
court.
he
is
not
acting
independent
of
the
court.
as
this
court
held
in
shadwick
versus
city
of
tampa,
the
clerk
when
working
with
the
court
is
intimately
related
to
the
court.
he
is
a
judicial
officer
and,
when
acting
under
the
supervision
of
a
judge,
he
should
be
accorded
the
same
protection
of
absolute
judicial
immunity
as
the
judge
would
be
if
the
judge
in
fact
had
performed
the
act
of
failing,
in
this
case,
either
to
adequately
communicate
to
the
police
department
a
warrant
recall
order
or
in
fact
created
procedures
as
he
did.
for
these
reasons,
we've
asked
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
