mr.
john
s.
elson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
a
clerk's
liability
for
the
proper
execution
of
a
court
order.
the
complaint
alleges
both
that
petitioner
did
not
fulfil
his
duty
to
deliver
to
the
police
the
court
order
recalling
respondent's
arrest
warrant
and
that
the
failure
to
deliver
that
order
is
alleged
to
have
resulted
from
petitioner's
continued
implementation
of
policies
and
customs
that
he
knew
were
inadequate,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
reading
from
the
complaint.
mr.
john
s.
elson
the
opinions
of
this
court
on
that
question
are
not
recent
and
the
question
is
not
clear.
mr.
john
s.
elson
the
general
proposition
is
that
the
court
would
look
at
the
nature
of
the
duty,
and
this
is
an
administrative
duty,
so
that
judicial
immunity
simply
wouldn't
apply,
since
this
court
has
determined--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--i'm
sorry,
stump?
mr.
john
s.
elson
stump
versus
sparkman?
mr.
john
s.
elson
in
stump
versus
sparkman,
the
court...
one
of
the
requirements
for
judicial
immunity
was
that
the
court
act
within
its
jurisdiction.
it
seems
clear
from
the
context
of
the
case
that
the
court
was
referring
to
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
jurisdiction
to
decide
cases.
and
i
think
this
interpretation
was
augmented
in
the
court's
recent
decision
in
dennis
versus
sparks,
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
purpose
of
judicial
immunity...
that
judicial
immunity
arose
in
order
to
protect
judges'
ability
"to
exercise
their
independent
judgment
about
the
merits
of
cases.
"
the
only
precedent
on
this,
direct
precedent
on
this
subject
dates
back
to
1879
in
the
case
of
ex
parte
virginia,
in
which
the
court
was
explicit
in
saying
that...
this
court
was
explicit
in
saying
that
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
actual
function
performed
by
a
judge,
and
that
if
a
judge
performs
a
function
that
could
just
as
well
be
handled
by
anybody...
in
that
case
it
was
a
purely
ministerial
duty...
then
the
judge
has
no
immunity
simply
because
of
his
title
and
status.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
was
a
mandamus
action.
thi
court
has
looked
at
the
policies
for
mandamus
for
immunity
in
terms
of
injunctive
relief
and
damages
in
some
cases
being
related.
in
that
case
there
was
no
indication
that
the
court
would
have
had
a
different
view
in
terms
of
damages,
certainly,
in
that
case.
i
would
even
hazard
that
the
reasons
for
injunctive
relief
might
be
even
stronger
than
for
damages.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it's
just
premature
to
determine
whether
any
immunity
would
be
appropriate.
judge
swygert--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--if
a
mandatory--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--if
the
mandatory
duty
were
of
a
ministerial
nature,
then
no
immunity
would
be
appropriate.
and
this
court...
all
of
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
the
question
of
immunity
have
held
that
the
fundamental
purpose
of
immunity
is
to
protect
an
official's
discretion,
ability
to
exercise
discretion
independently.
where
there
is
no
discretion,
then
the
fundamental
purpose
of
immunity
disappears.
judge
swygert
in
his
opinion
below
noted
that,
and
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
that
in
its
leading
opinion
of
mccray
versus
maryland.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i'm
sorry.
in
his
concurring
opinion
he
noted
that,
and
referred
to
mccray
versus
maryland
in
the
fourth
circuit
as
also
holding
that.
and
that
is
in
line
with
the
historical--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
there
is.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
on
the
ground
that
factual
clarification
was
necessary
to
determine
whether
official
immunity
was
appropriate,
and
cited
to
previous
seventh
circuit
case--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--well,
the
court...
the
only
indication
was
its
reference
to
its
previous
case
in
dieu
versus
norton.
in
that
case
the
court
determined
that
a
court
clerk
had
absolute
immunity
for
actually
carrying
out
the
orders
of
a
judge
acting
pursuant
to
his
legal
duties.
so
the
implication
from
the
seventh
circuit's
remand
would
be
a
remand
for
a
factual
determination
of
whether
the
clerk
was
in
fact
acting
pursuant
to
judicial--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--and
if
not,
the
question
of
no
immunity
is
unclear.
all
we
have
is
judge
swygert's
concurrence,
in
which
he
says
that
no
immunity
would
be
appropriate.
of
course,
he
was
also
referring
to
the
problem
of
whether
negligence
is
appropriate--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--the
trial
judge
would
have
to
determine
whether
there's
qualified
or
no
immunity.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
no
immunity
on
the
theory
that
he
was
performing
purely
a
ministerial
function.
mr.
john
s.
elson
and
he
had
no
disecretion
whatsoever
and
the
ministerial...
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
immunity
for
ministerial
functions
fits
within
the
historical
background
of
section
1983.
one
of
the
requirements
for
proving
absolute
immunity
under
section
1983
is
to
show...
the
petitioner
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
an
equivalent
immunity
in
1871,
when
section
1983
was
enacted.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
i
would
not,
because
the
order
in
this
case
of
the
chief
judge
was
purely
an
administrative
order,
and
it's
our
position--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--definitely.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that's
correct.
and
the
recent
decisions,
though
not
the
historical
decisions
on
this,
would
indicate
that
a
qualified
immunity
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that's
correct,
exactly.
mr.
john
s.
elson
oh,
definitely
not.
that's
not
closed,
and
the
seventh
circuit
i
think
as
very
clear
on
that.
but
of
course,
that
is
not
the
issue
presented--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--in
this
case.
going
back
to
the
historical,
the
equivalent
immunity...
and
i
would
emphasize
that,
because
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
without
any
equivalent
historical,
any
equivalent
immunity
at
common
law,
then
the
official's
claim
to
absolute
immunity
must
fail
because
the
literal
terms
of
section
1983
require
an
all-inclusive
scope
of
liability
which
must
be
give
effect
without
the
background
of
an
equivalent
immunity.
and
here
the
law
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
absolutely
clear,
and
it
was
best
stated
in
this
court's
1870
decision
in
amy
versus
supervisors,
in
which
the
court
held,
this
court
held,
that
officials
had
not
even
a
good
faith
immunity
for
their
negligence
in
carrying
out
their
duties.
and
there's
no
reason...
and
the
law
is
very
clear
that
court
clerks
were
not
exempted
from
this
rule
of
official
liability.
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
mandatory
duty
of
the
court
clerk
was.
and
this
is
stated
in
the
appendix
at
page
23,
which
stated--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--that's
correct,
that
was
the
view
in
the
seventh
circuit
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
parrot
versus
taylor.
mr.
john
s.
elson
which
indicated
that
that
was
no
longer
the
law
in
terms
of
negligence
being
not
sufficient
to
state
a
claim
under
section
1983.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i'm
not
sure
whether
your
hypothetical
is
talking
about
the
deputy
clerk
who
failed
to
actually
physically
get
the
document
to
the
police
or
the
chief
clerk
who
was
responsible
for
the
procedures.
mr.
john
s.
elson
either
one.
well,
in
either
case
there
would
be
no...
it
would
be
our
position
that
there
would
be
no
absolute
immunity.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
believe
the
question
you're
asking
goes
to
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
violation,
and
it
could
very
well
be--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--well,
it's
our
position
that
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
violation
does
not
affect
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
here's
immunity.
those
are
wholly
separate
questions,
and
it's
given
in
any
immunity
case
that
there
is
a
sufficiently
severe
violation
to
rise
to
constitutional
proportions.
so--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--yes,
i--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--it's
unclear.
but
the
duty
was,
as
is
spelled
out
in
the
chief
judge's
order
which
is
quoted
on
page
23
of
the
appendix,
where
it
says,
three
times
actually.
"the
clerk
shall
deliver
the
warrant
recall
order
to
the
central
warrant
unit.
"
it
couldn't
be
more
explicit
in
that
regard.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
i
don't
believe
the
court
of
appeals
reached
that
level
of
inquiry
into
the
case.
there
had
simply
been
no
factual
development
to
determine
whether
there
had
been
any
violation
at
all,
and
possibly
whether
in
fact
the
clerk
may
have
acted
pursuant,
adequately
acted
pursuant
to
the
commands
of
the
judge.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
i
think
it
can
in
certain
situations,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
already
decided
that
it
can
in
its
parrot
decision.
again,
however,
i
would
emphasize
that
that
question
is
not
raised
in
this
case.
certainly
if
this
court
could
find
that
negligence
is
not...
does
not
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation,
the
issue
here
is
absolute
immunity
given
a
constitutional
violation.
even
if
petitioner
were
able
to
show
a
common
law
background
for
absolute
immunity,
petitioner
could
not
meet
the
second
burden,
independent
burden
of
establishing
immunity,
and
that
is
that
the
immunity
is
essential
to
the
proper
performance
of
a
court
clerk's
duties.
petitioner
has
no
explanation
for
why
an
absolute
immunity
is
essential
to
the
performance
of
the
court
clerk's
duties,
while
on
the
other
hand
this
court
has
held
that
such
immunity
is
not
essential
to
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
a
governor,
of
school
board
members,
hospital
administrators,
prison
administrators,
policemen.
if--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--that's
correct.
and
if
the
petitioner's
duties
in
this
case
are
anything
more
than
ministerial,
they
are
certainly
no
more
than
of
an
executive
or
administrative
nature
and
therefore
deserve
no
more
immunity
than
administrative
or
executive
officials.
indeed,
i
would
argue
that
it
deserves
less
immunity
because
normally
court
clerks
perform...
have
less
discretion
in
their
duties
than
say
governors,
cabinet
officers,
et
cetera.
petitioner's
primary
policy
argument
is
that,
as
we've
heard,
the
clerks
serve
as
an
aide
to
the
judge
and
that
they
are
important
to
judicial
proceedings.
well,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
official
immunity
depends
not
on
an
official's
status
or
his
location
in
the
judicial
process,
but
on
whether
the
judgments
of
the
official
are
functionally
comparable
to
the
judgments
of
a
judge
in
deciding
cases,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
dennis
opinion.
since
the
petitioner's
responsibility
for
the
unconstitutional
arrest
in
this
case
in
failing
to
have
adequate
procedures
had
nothing
to
do
with
deciding
the
merits
of
a
case,
this
functional
comparability
argument,
ground,
is
conclusive
that
judicial
immunity
cannot
apply.
petitioner--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--well,
insofar
as
the
judge's
secretary's
and
law
clerk's
duties
were
concerned
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
of
an
actual
case
in
the
adjudicative
process,
definitely.
if
they
were
routine
administrative
duties,
although
that
question
of
course
is
not
before
this
court,
i
would
assert
that
the
rationale
for
judicial
immunity
simply
would
not
apply.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
in
terms
of
deciding
the
case.
the
court
clerk
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
deciding
the
case.
in
certain
cases--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--that's
correct.
however,
in
certain
cases,
court
clerks
ar
given
authority
to
perform
what
may
be
called
quasi-judicial
kinds
of
functions,
like
deciding
the
appropriateness
of
probable
cause
for
arrest
or
th
appropriateness
of
bonds.
and
there
i
think
the
quasi-judicial
immunity
might
apply,
because
it's
judge-like
decision
on
a
case.
mr.
john
s.
elson
the
statute
provides
a
remedy.
i
know
of
no
cases
in
which
damages
were
actually
collected,
but
the
illinois
statute--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--certainly
implicit
in
that
is
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
legislature
that
immunity
is
not
necessary
for
a
court
clerk's
functions.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
definitely
do,
although
immunity
is
a
federal
law
matter,
as
martinez
versus
california
indicates,
it
certainly--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--well,
i
think
that
would
simply
reinforce
the
proposition
that
there
are
no
valid
policy
reasons--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--well,
i
think
one
could
rely
on
section
1988
of
title
42
to
argue
that
where
the
federal
law
is
deficient
in
any
respect,
that
is,
it
doesn't
provide
in
any
way
about
immunity,
then
you
would
look
to
state
law
that
most
effectively
serves
the
purposes
of
the
federal
statute.
and
in
that
case
you
would
look
at
the
state
law's
abrogation
of
immunity.
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
law
in
illinois
to
indicate
that
clerks
even
had
immunity
in
this
type
of
situation,
that
illinois
was
in
line
with
all
of
the
other
states
in
indicating
that
court
clerks
had
no
immunity.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
they...
for
ministerial
duties
they
had
no
immunity.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
deal
with
discretionary
duties.
mr.
john
s.
elson
under
the
statute
cited
in
the
brief,
it
indicates
that
the
clerk
would
be
civilly
responsible
for
the
failures
of
the
clerk.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
very
well
could
be.
there
is
also
a
statute
in
illinois
that
gives
immunity
for
discretionary
acts
of
officials
doing
governmental
functions,
as
in
most
states.
and
how
illinois
would
interplay
with
these
two
statutes
is
unclear
in
this
case.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
case,
the
new
case
cited
by
petitioner,
the
new
illinois
supreme
court
decision,
points
out
that
in
1870,
i
believe,
when
the
illinois
constitution
was
promulgated,
court
clerks
were
not
considered
even
non-judicial
officers
of
the
court,
that
they
were
county
officials.
so
they
didn't
even
have
that
proximity
under
the
law
at
the
time
1983
was
enacted.
petitioner
also
argues
that
immunity
is
necessary
to
promote
judicial
efficiency.
well,
the
opposite
is
true.
the
protection
of
constitutional
rights
and
the
promotion
of
judicial
administration
are
clearly
mutually
reinforcing
goals,
not
antagonistic
at
all.
the
facts
of
this
case
i
believe
demonstrate
the
possibility
of
a
clerk's
liability
for
an
constitutional
arrest
caused
by
ineffective
procedures
for
handling
warrant
recalls
would
have
two
effects.
it
would
be
an
incentive
to
have
more
efficient
procedures
and
thereby
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
unconstitutional
arrest.
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
petitioner
himself
recognized
this
effect
of
1983
liability
when
he
in
his
office
memo
to
his
clerk
that's
on
page
20
of
the
appendix...
that
memo
warns
that
deputies
who
failed
to
follow
correct
procedures
on
the
handling
of
recall
orders
may
be
subject,
as
well
as
may
subject
the
clerk's
office,
to
liability
under
section
1983.
if
such
liability
encourages
petitioner's
subordinates--
mr.
john
s.
elson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
we
recessed
for
lunch
i
was
discussing
why
absolute
immunity
is
not
necessary
to
promote
judicial
efficiency.
and
i
was
pointing
out,
the
petitioner's
own
memo
to
his
clerks,
to
his
subordinates,
showed
recognition
that
1983
liability
is
indeed
an
incentive
to
promote
efficient
judicial
procedures.
and
i
would
point
out
that
if
it's
an
incentive
to
petitioner's
subordinates
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
it
wouldn't
be
an
incentive
to
petitioner
himself
to
use
adequate
procedures.
there
is
a
third
criteria
for
establishing
absolute
immunity
from
damages,
and
that
is
that
petitioner
must
show
that
there
are
adequate
safeguards
built
into
the
process
by
which
the
court
clerk
or
any
official
acts
that
reduce
the
need
for
a
damage,
1983
damage
remedy.
this
court
has
never
found
absolute
immunity
justified
unless
there
were
adequate,
such
adequate
safeguards
built
into
the
process
by
which
the
official
acts.
and
those
safeguards,
which
were
described
in
economou
versus
butts...
the
most
essential
ones
are
the
right
to
an
adversarial
hearing,
the
right
to
appeal,
and
recourse
to
precedent.
petitioner's
failure
here
to
have
adequate
safeguards,
being
a
purely
administrative...
to
have
adequate
procedures
for
handling
these
recalls,
is
purely
an
administrative
type
of
action
and
occurred
wholly
outside
of
the
adjudicative
process.
so
there
is
no
possibility
of
such
safeguards
being
present,
and
therefore
there's
no
need...
there's
no
reduction
in
the
need
for
a
section
1983
damage
remedy
to
restrain
constitutional
violations.
and
this
is
an
independent
requirement
of
absolute
immunity
the
petitioner
has
the
burden
of
showing,
the
existence
of
these
safeguards.
in
response
to
petitioner's
argument,
i
would
point
out
that
essentially
i
think
petitioner
has
conceded
the
question
presented
of
whether
he's
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
in
his
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
as
to
whether
there
is...
as
to
whether
a
clerk
would
be
immune
if
the
clerk
violated
a
court
order
and
discriminated
against
an
individual.
in
conceding
that
there
would
be
no
immunity
in
that
case,
i
think
that
essentially
essentially
concedes
the
question
presented.
i
think
that
concession
is
dictated
in
sum,
by
the
three
separate
requirements
for
absolute
immunity
that
this
court
has
set
up
in
all
of
its
immunity
cases:
that
there
be
adequate
safeguards,
that
there
be
policy
reasons
that
make
immunity
necessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
official's
duties,
and
that
there
be
an
equivalent
historical
immunity
as
a
background.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that's
correct.
i
don't
know
if
i
would
phrase
it
as
a
derivative
immunity.
there
must
be...
the
clerk
must
perform
a
function--
mr.
john
s.
elson
--that's
correct,
because
the
legislative
aide
was
performing
a
task
that
would
be
immune
if
the
legislator
had
himself
performed
it.
derivative
immunity
of
a
court
clerk,
however,
would
be
not
a
judicial
type
of
action.
it
would
be
related
to
carrying
out
a
judge's
order,
and
therefore
almost
as
an
arm
of
the
judge.
mr.
john
s.
elson
the
task
itself
wouldn't
be
quasi-judicial
because
it's
not
functionally
like
deciding
cases.
there
would
be
a
derivative
immunity,
an
absolute
immunity.
i
think
the
term
"quasi-judicial"
has
been
used
in
many
senses,
but
there
would
be
an
absolute
immunity
because
he'd
be
carrying
out
an
explicit
order
of
a
judge.
and
in
the
same
sense
i
think
that
the
gravel
case
indicates
that
just
because
a
court
clerk
happens
to
be
an
aide
of
the
judge,
just
as
the
legislative
aide
was
an
aide
of
the
senator,
that
status
does
not
in
itself
confer
immunity.
there
has
to
be
a
functional
equivalence.
because
petitioner
has
not
met
any
of
the
three
separate
requirements
for
absolute
immunity
this
court
has
set
forth,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
claim
of
absolute
immunity
in
this
case.
