unknown
speaker
mr.
mayer,
is
it
your
position
basically
that
the
clerk
should
enjoy
absolute
immunity
here,
even
if,
for
example,
he
refused
to
forward
any
recall
orders
involving
blacks?
unknown
speaker
as
a
clerk,
he
declines
to
forward
any
recall
orders
involving
blacks.
absolutely
immune
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
that
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
duty,
then,
affect
whether
in
your
view
there
is
absolute
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
mayer,
is
it
not
true
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
those
procedures
were
knowingly
adopted
even
though
they
were
unconstitutional
procedures?
page
9
of
the
joint
appendix
has
that
kind
of
allegation.
unknown
speaker
well,
here's
the
paragraph
i
have
reference
to:
"the
conduct,
procedures
and
customs
herein
alleged
occurred
and
continued
to
occur
during
the
course
of
and
as
a
result
of
defendant's
knowing
and
unconstitutional
adoption,
promulgation,
revocation,
and
implementation
of
policies,
statements,
regulations,
and
known
custom.
"
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
that
your
client
is
immune
even
though
he
did
exactly
what's
alleged
there,
absolutely
immune?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mayer,
do
you
see
any
distinction
between
the
clerk's
act
in
carrying
out
the
order
of
the
judge
or
the
court
or
in
refusing
to
carry
it
out?
unknown
speaker
if
the
clerk
just
refuses
to
carry
out
the
judge's
order
to
transmit
recalls?
unknown
speaker
is
this
derivative
from
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
judge
said,
that
rule
you've
got
that's
set
out
on
page
9,
don't
you
ever
follow
it,
and
he
continues
to
follow
it.
is
he
still
immune?
unknown
speaker
does
that
go
to
the
property
clerk,
too?
does
your
rule
apply
to
the
deputy
clerk,
too?
unknown
speaker
and
the
assistant
clerk?
unknown
speaker
and
the
stenographer?
tell
me
when
to
stop.
unknown
speaker
and
the
man
that
opens
the
door,
and
the
man
that
sweeps
the
room?
you
haven't
told
me
to
stop
yet.
unknown
speaker
this
applies,
you
say,
to
the
judge's
bailiff?
unknown
speaker
his
chauffeur--
unknown
speaker
--why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
bailiff?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
bailiff
acting
as
a
chauffeur--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
under
your
theory,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
earlier
i
thought
you
responded
to
one
question
that
indicated
that
if
the
clerk
had
an
order
from
the
judge
and
he
failed
to
carry
that
order
out
he
would
still
have
immunity.
now,
if
it's
derivative
from
the
judge,
how
is
it
a
quasi-immunity
act
if
he's
doing
not
what
the
judge
ordered
him
to
do,
but
failing
to
do
what
the
judge
ordered
him
to
do?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
qualified
immunity
be
adequate
here,
in
terms
of
exactly
what
happened?
if
you
say
all
it
was
was
a
piece
of
negligence,
why
would
he
need
any
more
than
qualified
immunity?
unknown
speaker
why
do
clerks
ever
post
bonds?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
aren't
they
just
absolutely
immune?
are
they
just
paying
money
out
for
nothing
for
bonds?
unknown
speaker
can
you
sue
a
clerk
on
his
bond?
can
the
clerk
be
sued
on
his
bond
for
this
conduct,
for
malfeasance
in
office?
unknown
speaker
why
can
he
be
sued
on
his
bond
if
he's
absolutely
immune?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
illinois...
in
illinois
is
the
bond
required
of
a
clerk,
a
bond,
an
insurance
policy
like
the
public
liability
for
driving
an
automobile,
or
is
it
a
bond
simply
to
replace
any
money
which
he
receives
and
embezzles?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
illinois
legislature
passed
a
statute
that
says,
we
know
we've
read
all
about
this
immunity
for
state
officers
under
1983,
but
that
just
is
an
assumption
by
the
supreme
court
or
by
some
courts
that
this
kind
of
immunity
is
essential
to
get
the
public
work
done.
well,
we
hereby
declare
that
it
is
not
essential
to
get
the
illinois
public
work
done
to
have
immunity
under
1983.
there
certainly
wouldn't
be
any
immunity
then,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
doesn't
want
any
protection
for
its
officers
to
protect
its
public
business.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think...
could
the
clerk
have
been
sued
under
state
law
here?
unknown
speaker
and
he
would
not
have
been
immune?
under
state
law
he
would
not
have
been
immune?
unknown
speaker
he
could
be
sued
for
this
conduct
right
here,
and
he
would
not
be
immune
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
for
the
negligence
of
his
deputies?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
asking
the
federal
courts,
then,
to
be
more
roman
than
the
romans?
if
the
illinois
courts,
the
illinois
legislature,
permit
this
sort
of
an
action
in
state
court
against
a
clerk,
i
would
think
justice
white
is
quite
right
that
illinois
has
determined
that
absolute
immunity
isn't
necessary.
or
any
kind
of
immunity.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
it's
an
open
question--
unknown
speaker
--you
just
told
me
that
there
could
be
recovery
against
this
clerk
in
an
illinois
court
under
state
law
for
this
very
conduct.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you
just
told
me
a
while
ago.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
so
what
do
you
mean,
is
there
a
remedy
for
this
conduct
under
state
law
or
not?
unknown
speaker
is
your
state
statute
cited
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief
or
what?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
may
i
ask
this
question.
is
there
a
difference
between
action
and
non-action
by
the
clerk?
assume,
for
example,
that
the
clerk
neglected
to
issue
the
mandate
of
the
court,
just
inadvertently
failed
to
do
it.
that
would
be
non-action.
you
have
non-action
in
this
case.
does
the
immunity
for
which
you
argue
extend
regardless
of
whether
it's
action
or
non-action?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
inaction
was
deliberate?
the
clerk
just
didn't
want
to
have
the
mandate
issue
because
he
didn't
agree
with
it.
unknown
speaker
even
if
he
deliberately
ignored
the
judgment
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mayer,
you
didn't
raise
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
clerk
could
be
held
substantively
liable
under
1983.
as
i
understand
your
petition,
the
only
question
you
raise
is,
assuming
that
the
clerk
can
be
held
liable
for
these
rather
detached
and
passive
acts,
whether
notwithstanding
the
substantive
liability
he
may
assert
an
absolute
immunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it's
abrogated
by
state
law?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
this
respondent
is
not
a
disgruntled
person.
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
made
any
mention
of
the
facts
underlying
this.
she
was
a
victim,
as
i
understand
it,
of
a
robbery
or
a
mugging
or
something.
unknown
speaker
she
was
more
than
disgruntled.
unknown
speaker
but
arising
out
of
the
theft
of
her
credit
cards,
no?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mayer,
at
this
point
we
really
don't
know
what
happened,
do
we,
because
it
was
resolved
on
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
elson,
suppose
you
had
a
situation,
instead
of
hundreds
of
clerks
in
the
office,
you
have
a
justice
of
the
peace,
a
judicial
officer
out
in
the
country,
who
has
no
clerk,
no
staff,
no
secretary,
and
then
you
postulate
all
the
facts
that
happened
here:
that
he
should
have
sent
something
to
the
sheriff
or
to
the
police,
but
he
went
fishing
or
he
just
forgot
it
or
he
put
it
in
the
drawer
and
mislaid
it.
would
the
judge
have
absolute
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
general
proposition
about
judicial
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
strunk
case
should
shed
some
light
on
the
answer
to
that
question,
shouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
strunk.
stump.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
was
a
mandamus
action.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position,
counsel,
that
the
clerk
would
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
for
failure
or
refusal
to
perform
a
mandatory
duty?
unknown
speaker
just
in
abstract
terms,
not
with
reference
to
the
determination
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
assuming
that
we
had
a
clerk
who
failed
or
refused
to
perform
a
mandatory
duty--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
your
view
of
th
appropriate
of
what
would
be
appropriate?
unknown
speaker
judge
swygert's
opinion
was
a
concurring
opinion.
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
on
the
remand
for
trial,
which
i
gather
was
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
issue
of
immunity
open?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
say
whether
official
immunity.
in
what
form,
absolute
or--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
not,
no
immunity
at
all?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that,
if
on
the
remand
there
were
a
determination
there
ought
to
be
some
immunity,
that
what,
the
trial
judge
would
have
to
determine
whether
it
was
going
to
be
qualified
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no
on
the
theory
that
he
wasn't
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
ministerial
office.
unknown
speaker
mr.
elson,
before
you
leave
the
question
on
remand,
is
it
not
correct
that
there
are
three
alternatives,
rather
than
two,
even
under
your
view
of
the
law?
one
would
be
that
if
it
were
a
mere
ministerial
act
there
would
be
no
immunity
at
all.
and
the
other
extreme,
if
he's
carrying
out
a
direct
order
of
the
judge
and
if
he
does
exactly
what
the
judge
tells
him
to,
i
think
you
probably
would
agree
that's
absolute
immunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
a
little
differently.
would
there
not
be
some
situations
in
which
the
clerk
did
nothing
more
than
carry
out
a
direct
order
of
a
judge
where
he
would
be
entitled
to
absolute
immunity?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
is
there
not
an
intermediate
category
where
he
might
have...
he's
not
carrying
out
a
direct
order,
he
might
be
performing
a
discretionary
act,
such
as
drafting
new
procedures
or
something
like
that,
where
you
might
recognize
qualified
immunity?
unknown
speaker
and
this
conceivably
could
be
such
a
case,
because
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
his
procedures
are
reasonable
or
not.
unknown
speaker
so
that
actually
on
remand
any
one
of
those
three
alternatives
is
at
least
conceivable?
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
to
affirm
the
remand,
we
need
not
now
determine
what
immunity
he's
entitled
to.
unknown
speaker
mr.
elson,
i
take
it
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
the
issue
of
liability,
as
opposed
to
immunity,
isn't
totally
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeals.
as
i
read
the
author
of
the
opinion,
he
kind
of
treats
the
case
like
a
hunting
accident
and
said,
you
know,
one
of
these
five
people
must
be
liable,
go
back
and
figure
out
who.
but
it's
not
irrefutably
foreclosed
that
the
clerk
here
might
be
held
not
liable,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
clerk
had
a
mandatory
duty
to
send
this
form
along,
this
warrant
recall
form
along,
and
there
was
just
some
negligence
by
him
or
one
of
his
deputies
that...
suppose
when
the
facts
are...
it's
just
a
pure
case
of
negligence.
now,
wasn't
there
a
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
that
wouldn't...
if
it
were
just
negligence,
it
would
not
amount
to
a
1983
violation?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
suppose
all
the
clerk
did
was
negligently
fail
to
carry
out
what...
the
requirements
of
a
quite
adequate
set
of
procedures
and
regulations
that
he
and
the
judge
worked
out.
on
their
face
they're
perfectly
all
right.
he
just
negligently
failed
to
carry
it
out.
and
he's
sued
in
1983,
stating
a
cause
of
action,
and
the
facts
show
that
he
has
been
negligent.
now
what
kind
of
an
immunity
would
you
say
he
would
enjoy
in
that?
unknown
speaker
either
one.
unknown
speaker
because
he
just
negligently
failed
to
carry
out
an
order.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
my
question
doesn't.
i
thought
you
went
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
let's
assume
there
is.
negligent
conduct
may
nevertheless
amount
to
a
constitutional
violation.
assume
there
is.
now
the
question
is
immunity.
unknown
speaker
so
would
you
put
this
in
the
category
that
this
was
a
ministerial
act
that
he
failed
to
carry
out?
unknown
speaker
so
no
immunity
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
then
was
there
a
remand?
did
a
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
decide
that
there
might
be
immunity
even
though
it
was
only
a
ministerial
act?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
you
think
that
mere
negligence
rises
to
a
constitutional
violation
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
cabinet
officers.
unknown
speaker
in
the
gravel
case,
we
extended
immunity
that
was
primarily
that
of
a
senator
to
a
senatorial
aide.
would
you
think
that
judicial
immunity
might
at
least
rub
off
on
the
judge's
secretary
or
the
judge's
law
clerk?
unknown
speaker
and
you
feel
the
court
clerk
is
just
sufficiently
removed
beyond
that
intimate
connection
with
the
judge
for
it
to
rub
off
on
the
court
clerk?
unknown
speaker
he's
not
supposed
to.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there's
a
remedy
against
the
clerk
for
this
conduct
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
think
that...
is
that
a
declaration
that
the
clerk
has
no
immunity
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
that
has
any
relevance
to
the
immunity
question
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
question
of
construction
of
1983
and
what
congress
might
have
intended
when
they
passed
it
and
whether
the
intended
to
revoke
common
law
immunities.
but
if
the
common
law
in
a
certain
state
has
suddenly
changed,
been
changed
by
statute,
and
the
otherwise...
the
immunity
that
a
clerk
would
otherwise
have
in
that
state
has
suddenly
been
eliminated
by
the
state
legislature,
what
should
the
federal
courts
do
about
it
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
that
there
had
been
a
clear
decision
in
the
federal
courts
that
in
state
a
that
court
clerks
were
immune,
absolutely
immune.
and
than
there's
a
statute
passed
in
state
a
that
says
there
is
no
such
immunity,
we
don't
need
that
kind
of
immunity.
and
then
there's
a
1983
suit
brought
in
the
same
state
against
a
clerk
for
very
similar...
would
he
then
be
immune?
unknown
speaker
none
whatsoever,
qualified
or
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
for
non-ministerial?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
under
your
illinois
statute,
suppose
one
of
these
clerks,
who
i
think
you
suggested
might
fix
bond,
for
example,
or
determine
probable
cause,
do
that
in
substitution
for
the
local
magistrate,
and
suppose
he
does
it
in
some
impermissible
way.
could
he
be
liable
under
your
statute
in
state
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
for
a
judicial
act,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
it
must
be
something
paralleling
the
kind
of
derivative
immunity
that
was
defined
in
gravel:
that
if
a
senator's
aide
is
performing
a
legislative
task,
which
is
the
way
gravel
limited
the
immunity,
then
he
is
immune.
if
he
is
not
performing
something
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
what
the
senator
would
do
for
himself--
unknown
speaker
--then
there
is
no
derivative
immunity.
unknown
speaker
it's
certainly
derivative
immunity
in
the
gravel
case.
unknown
speaker
if
he
issued,
if
the
clerk
issued,
was
authorized
to
and
did
issue
a
warrant
or
a
subpoena,
would
you
say
that
was
quasi-judicial
and
subject
to
immunity?
