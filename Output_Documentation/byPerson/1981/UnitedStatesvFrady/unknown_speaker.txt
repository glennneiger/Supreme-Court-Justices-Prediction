unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
before
you
leave
the
specific
instructions,
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
these
instructions
were
given
to
the
jury
in
written
form?
or
were
they
just
read
orally?
unknown
speaker
it
appears
they
were
read
orally,
but
i
can't
really
be
sure.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
arguing
now,
mr.
frey,
that
there's
no
constitutional
error?
unknown
speaker
oh,
is
that
one
of
the
questions
you
brought
up
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
in
so
many
words
one
of
the
questions
you
listed,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
i'm
sorry,
but
you're
leaving
the
point
that
i
don't
think
was
entirely
extraneous
to
your
plain
error
point,
because
it
seems
to
me...
aren't
you
saying
that
there
must
be
constitutional
error,
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
plain
non-constitutional
error
is
not
sufficient
ground
for
collateral
attack?
unknown
speaker
unless
it
meets
the
fundamental
impact--
unknown
speaker
--i
want
to
be
sure
i
grasp
what
you
were
driving
at.
what
you
were
saying
is
that
this
instruction
read
in
context,
even
if
it
might
have
been
plain
error
in
the
sense
of
reversible
error,
non-constitutional
reasons,
nevertheless
is
not
the
kind
of
error
that's
open
to
review
on
collateral
attack.
unknown
speaker
which
would
seem
to
me
to
be
well
within
your
first
question,
if
i
understand
the
first
question.
unknown
speaker
it
just
wasn't
one
of
the
separate
question.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
assume
that
it's
a
constitutional
error
that
fundamentally
tainted
the
trial,
and
then
the
question
is
whether
plain
error,
given
those
facts,
is--
unknown
speaker
--or
wainwright.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
come
back
to
this
point
is
that
in
the
prior
case,
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made
is
that
the
wainwright
standard
simply
doesn't
apply
if
the
error
is
sufficiently
grave.
well,
that's
what
was
held
below,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
there's
nothing
about
52(b)
on
its
face
that
would
suggest
a
distinction,
does
there,
between
direct
review
or
collateral?
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
said
so?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
this
is
a
2255
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
civil
action,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
not
a
civil
action,
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
continuation
of
the
criminal
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
this
for
this
purpose?
unknown
speaker
but
otherwise,
hasn't
it
been
regarded
as
simply
a
continuation
of
the
criminal
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
davis
won,
was
it
not?
the
language
of
12(b)(2).
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
let's
just
assume
for
purposes
of
history
that
you
go
from
davis
one
to
francis
v.
henderson
to
wainwright
v.
sykes,
and
you
have
specific
language
in
davis
one;
it's
carried
over
in
francis
v.
henderson,
and
in
wainwright
v.
sykes
it's
perhaps
elaborated
on,
but
it
expresses
more
a
feeling
or
mood
rather
than
any
precise
standard
or
any
measurable
thing
as
if
it
were
dealing
with
mathematical
equations.
unknown
speaker
you
say
he
raised
these
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
deny,
do
you,
that
it
was
a
2255
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
argue
that
for
that
reason
the
contours
of
the
2255
proceeding
differ,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
local
issues
or
issues
of
local
law
as
to
which
there
were
errors?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
how
does
that
differ...
how
does
that
change
the
issues
that
this
case
presents
from
a
2255
and
some
other
federal
district--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
suggest
the
government
to
suggest
that
the
case
wasn't
properly
there,
this
2255
proceeding
is
properly
there.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
what
claims
under
local
law
are
here
in
addition
to
the
federal
constitutional
claims?
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
saying
that's
an
error
of
local
law?
unknown
speaker
although
it
might
also
be
an
error
of
constitutional
dimensions?
unknown
speaker
but
the
same
error
would
be
both.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
then
that
the
scope
of
review
under
2255
is
broader
in
he
district
of
columbia
than
it
is
in
any
other
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
came
up
in
a
federal
enclave
conviction?
unknown
speaker
in
the
assimilated
crimes,
military
reservations.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schember,
is
this
something
like
that
if
there's
an
error
of
district
law,
entirely
apart
from
whether
or
not
the
error
might
also
be
of
constitutional
dimensions,
that
in
effect,
if
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
judgment
on
the
reparation
of
an
error
of
district
law,
that's
like
a
state
court
deciding
a
case
on
a
state
ground
and
therefore,
it's
none
of
our
business
here
to
review
it?
unknown
speaker
but
those
decisions
just
go
to
whether
the
instruction
was
error.
they
are
not
local
law
decision
saying
the
scope
of
review
under
2255
is
plain
error,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
but
they
don't
go
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
scope
of
review
on
collateral
attack,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
they
established
the
fact
that
these
instructions
were
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
district
of
columbia
law.
unknown
speaker
but
that
still
leaves
open
the
question
whether
on
collateral
attack
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
anywhere
else
in
the
federal
system,
the
federal
court
may
review
a
matter
of
local
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
equal
protection
with
what?
comparing
this
litigant
with
what
other
litigant
who's
being
treated
more--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
couldn't
have
collateral
attack
if
this
is
not
the
right
rule.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
any
collateral
review
for
a
district
of
columbia
prisoner
other
than
under
2255?
unknown
speaker
what's
his
collateral
relief?
unknown
speaker
no,
are
we
talking
about
since
the
reform
act?
unknown
speaker
are
we
talking
about
the
situation
since
the
reform
act?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
of
course
these
felonies,
district
of
columbia
felonies,
are
tried
in
the
superior
court,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
then
if
there
is
to
be
collateral
relief,
there's
a
special
statute,
you're
telling
me?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there's
a
determination
that
there
has
been
some
kind
of
error
of
district
of
columbia
law,
then
there's
no
review
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
what's
you
suggestion?
do
we
have
to
review
cases
like
that?
say
no.
unknown
speaker
palmore
was
nothing
like
this.
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words,
to
treat
this
kind
of
case
where
it's
purely
district
of
columbia
law,
exactly
as
we're
required
to
treat
a
state
supreme
court
case.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
at
all
that
it
was
applying
local
law?
unknown
speaker
did
it
do
so
explicitly,
or
did
it
purport
to
apply
general
federal
law?
1--
unknown
speaker
--but
those
were
decided
before
the
court
reform
act.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
the
section
of
the
opinion
dealing
with
the
standard
of
review,
they
didn't
cite
those
cases;
they
relief
on
davis,
fay
v.
noia
and
rule
30
and
rule
52(b).
unknown
speaker
they're
the
only
cases
cited.
the
cases
that
you're
relying
on
are
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
error;
not
in
the
part
of
the
opinion
dealing
with
the
scope
of
review.
unknown
speaker
well,
equal
protection
with
what?
many
state
collateral
review
systems
do
not
allow
review
of
a
matter
that
would
just
be
raisable
on
direct
appeal.
they
have
a
similar
standard
to
the
2255
standard,
fundamental
error,
constitutional
error
and
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
district
of
columbia
case
on
which
you
rely
for
this
proposition?
unknown
speaker
well
what,
in
this
case,
is
your
submission,
was
the
fundamental
right
under
district
law
that
was
denied
frady?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
that
kind
of
error
been
held
to
be
fundamental
error
as
a
matter
of
district
of
columbia
law?
unknown
speaker
do
they
deal
with
errors
found
to
be
fundamental?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
even
if
you
are
correct
and
you're
examining
the
question
from
the
standpoint
of
prejudice,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
frady
asserted
he
wasn't
even
around
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
he
wasn't
even
there.
and
yet,
you
have
a
jury
that
found
on
the
facts
first
degree
murder.
there
wasn't
even
a
need
to
deal
with
inferred
malice,
was
there?
how
was
he
possibly
prejudiced
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
he
says
he
wasn't
even
there.
and
yet,
the
jury
found
he
was
and
found
the
evidence
to
support
first
degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
an
intimation
that
they
thought,
that
the
majority
thought
they
were
exercising
their
remaining
vestige
of
their
article
i
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
how
much
of
kaufman
do
you
think
is
left
after
stone
v.
powell?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
mr.
schember,
i
take
it
all
of
the
rule
governing
2255
actions,
even
as
to
the
district
of
columbia
errors
that
you
mentioned
in
your
submission,
would
apply,
wouldn't
they?
for
example
rule
12,
isn't
it,
of
the
2255
rules
gives
the
reviewing
court
an
option
to
take
either
the
criminal
rules
of
procedure
or
the
civil,
whichever
are
the
more
appropriate.
unknown
speaker
and
here
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
picked
out
52(b)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
that
at
all
as
a
latitude
which
rule
12
of
2255
gives
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
it
did.
they
just
selected
that
one,
did
it
not,
as
the
proper
standard
here?
plain
error
standard.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
about
your
local
law
argument.
although
the
cases,
the
d.c.
cases,
allowing
collateral
attack
for
plain
error
as
a
matter
of
local
law,
which
you
cite
in
your
brief,
do
certainly
support
that
proposition,
the
way
they
state
the
plain
error
standard
in
the
quote
on
page
9
of
your
brief
is
under
the
plain
error
standard
apparently
in
the
district,
"the
error
complained
of
must
be
so
clearly
prejudicial
to
substantial
rights
as
to
jeopardize
the
very
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
trial.
"
now,
when
you
state
it
that
way,
it's
pretty
much
like
the
2255
standard,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
a
number
of
our
cases,
aren't
there,
mr.
frey,
which
have
suggested
a
reluctance
to
review
pure
questions
of
district
of
columbia
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
miller
and
united
states,
fisher
and
a
number
of
others--
unknown
speaker
--well,
nothing
i
said
suggests
that
we
can't
review
it.
unknown
speaker
but
we've
been
very
reluctant
to.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
