mr.
daniel
m.
schember
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
has
briefed
this
case
as
if
mr.
frady
were
a
federal
prisoner
convicted
of
a
federal
offense
and
who
has
filed
a
post-conviction
relief
motion
raising
only
federal
issues.
all
three
of
those
premises
are
false,
and
the
government
completely
overlooks
this
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
frady
is
a
district
of
columbia
prisoner.
he
was
convicted
of
a
local
crime.
his
motion
for
post-conviction
relief
raised
instruction
errors
which
said,
in
effect,
that
the
instructions
given
at
the
trial
improperly
informed
the
jury
as
to
what
the
government
had
to
prove
in
order
to
establish
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
first
degree
murder.
he
also
raised
the
claim
that
these
instructions
were
also
erroneous
under
mullaney
and
sandstrom,
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
no,
i'm
referring,
your
honor,
to
his
post-conviction
relief
petition.
now,
the
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
court
of
appeals,
they
sit
in
a
unique
jurisdiction,
and
this
case
dates
from
a
time
period
when
the
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
served
as
both
a
local
court
and
the
federal
court,
exercising
both
article
i
and
article
iii
power.
in
hearing
the
post-conviction
relief
petition,
the
district
court
was
exercising
a
remaining
vestige
of
that
article
i
power
which
was
not
taken
away
in
1970
when
most
of
that
power
was
transferred
to
the
superior
court.
in
this
circumstance,
where
you
have
a
d.c.
prisoner
convicted
solely
of
a
d.c.
offense
prior
to
the
court
reform
act,
having
to
come
back
to
the
court
which
sentenced
him,
as
2255
says,
with
a
claim
that
his
conviction
is
improper
under
district
of
columbia
law
and
that's
the
only
forum
he
can
go
to
to
make
that
claim,
the
district
court
has
an
obligation
to
afford
relief
if
district
of
columbia
law
in
fact
affords
relief.
this
was
the
basic
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals'
reliance
on
the
green
and
wharton
cases,
the
primary
precedents
which
the
court
invoked
to
grant
relief
in
this
case.
green
and
wharton
involved
the
two
instructions
that
were
involved
in
the
frady
case,
and--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
2255
applies
to
any
prisoner
who
was
sentenced
by
a
court
created
by
act
of
congress.
therefore,
it
applies
to
mr.
frady.
2255
then
tells
the
prisoner
what
court
you
have
to
go
to,
and
2255
says
it's
the
sentencing
court.
the
sentencing
court
in
this
case
was
the
united
states
district
court.
why
was
the
united
states
district
court
the
sentencing
court
in
this
purely
local
case?
it
was
the
sentencing
court
because
this
case
arose
prior
to
the
court
reform
act
of
1970.
prior
to
that
time,
the
u.s.
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
try
all
local
felonies,
and
served
in
that
capacity
as
both
a
local
court
and
a
federal
court
in
a
similar
manner
as
the
federal
courts
throughout
the
country.
it
is
for
that
particular
reason
that
this
case,
which
contains
both
federal
constitutional
issues
and
local
issues,
finds
it
way
back
into
the
united
states
district
court.
the
cases
relied
upon--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--my
contention,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
kind,
a
unique
case
which
only
arises
because
of
this
unique
circumstances
and
in
a
few
years
we
won't
have
anymore
cases
of
this
kind
due
to
the
passage
of
time
and
the
fact
that
the
court
reform
act
was
passed
in
1970,
my
contention
is
that
2255
states
that
the
forum
in
which
a
pre-court
reform
act
prisoner
must
seek
relief
is
the
united
states
district
court
because
that's
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
2255
affords
relief
for
prisoners
incarcerated
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
it
also
provides
relief
in
cases
that
are
otherwise
subject
to
collateral
attack.
a
case
of
a
d.c.
prisoner
in
federal
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
of
this
unique
circumstance
is
properly
there
under
2255,
and
if--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--no.
the
point
is
can
claims
under
local
law
be
made
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
the
claim
that
the
instructions
were
plain
error;
that
the
instructions
were
erroneous
because
the
jury
was
not
properly
informed
as
to
what
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
to
establish
the
elements
of
this
d.c.
offense.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
we
maintain
that
under
the
green
and
wharton
cases,
which
are
valid
local
precedents;
they
are
decisions--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--that
is,
in
effect,
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
are
you
referring
to--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
essentially
that
act
federalizes
local
offenses
and
makes
them
a
federal
offense
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
that's
not
what's
going
on
here.
this
is
a
district
of
columbia
offense,
and
it's
tried
as
a
district
of
columbia
case,
and
it
is
in...
it
was
in
federal
court
in
1963
solely
because
at
that
time
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
had
unique
jurisdiction,
unique
in
this
country,
to
try
local
and
federal
offenses.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
my
contention,
your
honor.
that
this
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
rests
on
an
adequate
independent
ground
of
district
of
columbia
law.
that
is
reflected
in
the
green
and
wharton
decisions
upon
which
the
court
relied
in
reaching
its
result.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
they
are
local
decisions
in
the
sense
that
they
were
decided
prior
to
february
1,
1971,--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--they
do
not
expressly
address
that
question,
of
course,
because
they
were--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
i
turn
to
that
question
next.
indeed,
that
was
the
question
that
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
had
to
decide,
or
the
district
court
as
well.
here,
the
court
was
presented
with
a
district
of
columbia
case
with
a
district
of
columbia
error
in
it,
and
the
question
is
can
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
grant
relief
in
the
2255
proceeding?
our
contention
here
is
that
since
the
2255
proceeding
is
the
only
avenue
open
to
the
prisoner
in
this
situation,
that
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
has
to
afford
relief
that
would
have
been
available...
that
is
available
under
district
of
columbia
law
and
would
have
been
afforded
had
this
case
not
been
a
pre-1970
case,
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--the
other
category
of
litigants
would
be
those
tried
and
convicted
of
murder
with
these
erroneous
instructions
in
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
they
could
very
well,
your
honor.
that
is
the
point
of
our
brief.
under
the
district
of
columbia
law,
the
failure
of
the
prisoner
to
have
raised
the
instruction
errors
at
trial,
or
on
direct
appeal,
does
not
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
error.
it
changes
the
standard
of
review,
of
course,
to
plain
error
due
to
the
operation
of
rule
30
and
there's
an
analogous
rule
30
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
if
that
prisoner
was
sentenced
in
a
district
of
columbia
court,
then
the
proceeding--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--there's
a
statute
created
by
the
court
reform
act--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
the
question
of
the
degree
of
the
review
of
a
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
decision
under
the
district
of
columbia
collateral
attack
statute,
i
believe
has
not
been
raised
in
this
court
as
to
the
scope
of
the
review.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
your
honor,
the
closest
thing
you've
had
i
believe
would
be
the
palmore
case
and
swaine
v.
presley.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
you
haven't
faced
this
issue
precisely.
my
suggestion
would
be
that
the
intent
of
the
court
reform
act
was
to
make
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
the
highest
court
of
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--absolutely,
that
is
my
contention.
and
it
is
simply
because
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
and
the
u.s.
district
court
have
this
remaining
vestige
of
article
i
jurisdiction
stemming
from
this
earlier
period--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--it
did
so
indeed
by
relying
upon
its
own
precedents,
green
and
wharton,
which--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--it
expressly
relied
on
green
and
wharton.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
they
were.
and
as
such,
they
are
valid
precedents
of
local
law,
since
they
were
decided...
the
date
is
a
little
bit
different
for
that
issue.
since
those
cases
were
decided
prior
to
february
1,
1971,
and
since
they
resolved
local
issues,
they
are
valid
local
precedents.
until
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
expressly
overrules,
which
of
course
it
has
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
those
cases
were
indeed
cited.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
what
i
am
maintaining
in
this
court
is
that
when
the
federal
district
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
faced
with
a
situation
of
this
kind,
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
they
must
grant
relief--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--that's
correct,
sir.
however,
examination
of
district
of
columbia
law
indicates
that
relief
is
not
foreclosed
due
to
failure
to
raise
the
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
your
honor,
a
series
of
cases
culminating
in
the
hargett
decision.
the
hargett
decision
stated
that...
well,
i
have
to
back
up.
the
atkinson
case
is
cited
by
both
the
government
and
mr.
frady,
and
the
atkinson
case
basically
held
that
collateral
relief
is
available
for
issues
not
raised
on
direct
appeal
under
exceptional
circumstances.
then
the
hargett
case,
a
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
decision,
held
that
exceptional
circumstances
exist
when
there's
been
a
denial
of
a
basic
right
not
limited
to
constitutional
rights.
it
is
clear
under
district
of
columbia
law,
that
the
failure
to
object
to
instructional
errors
at
trial
and
the
failure
to
appeal
on
those
issues
does
not
constitute
a
procedural
forfeiture
constituting
a
waiver.
so
long
as
you
can
show
that
there
was
a
denial
of
a
basic
right,
not
necessarily
a
constitutional
right,
district
of
columbia
law
affords
relief
and
does
not
place
a
procedural
bar
to
reaching
the
merits
and
obtaining
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
the
right
to
have
the
jury
properly
instructed
as
to
the
government's
burden
of
proof
to
establish
the
offense
of
murder.
there
were
three
instructional
errors
in
this
case;
the
mullaney
error
is
here,
the
sandstrom
error
is
here
and
the
effect
of
these
multiple
instruction
errors
was
to
essentially
relieve--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--they
are...
well,
they
have
been
held
fundamental
errors
under
united
states
constitutional
law
in
mullaney
and
sandstrom,
and
certainly...
and
they
were
held
erroneous
under
green
and
wharton,
and
green
and
wharton
are
valid
local
precedents
because
they
were
decided
prior
to
february
1,
1971.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
they
dealt
with
the
very
errors
involved
in
this
case.
the
question
that
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
faced
in
light
of
its
prior
precedents
in
green
and
wharton,
which
were
direct
appeal
cases,
was
whether
the
degree
of
prejudice
of
this
type
of
error,
recognized
to
be
plain
error
in
green
and
wharton,
was
sufficient
to
warrant
relief
on
collateral
attack.
there
is
recognition
in
district
of
columbia
law
that
direct
appeal
and
collateral
attack
are
not
the
same
thing.
but
the
difference
lies
not
in
whether
a
forfeiture
or
waiver
exists,
but
in
the
degree
of
prejudice
that
must
be
shown.
now,
i
have
to
admit--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
your
honor
has
eloquently
stated
an
argument
that
many
judges
that
have
reviewed
this
case
have
made.
other
judges
have
taken
the
opposing
view,
and
i
think
for
this
reason.
it
is
true
that
the
malice...
in
light
of
the
defense,
the
third
man
defense,
i
was
not
there;
it
was
someone
else
who
did
it...
as
to
that
specific
defense,
that
was
raised
by
the
defense.
no,
the
malice
instructions
cannot
be
deemed
to
be
prejudicial
to
that
defense.
but
the
fact
that
that
was
one
of
the
theories
that
the
defense
urged
does
not
mean
that
that
relieves
the
government
of
the
burden
of
proving
malice.
and
the
government's
case,
the
government's
evidence
here
fairly
raised
the
question
whether
this
was
murder
or
manslaughter,
as
the
trial
judge
so
held.
and
i
would
note
that
the
trial
judge
was
hardly
receptive
to
this
collateral
relief
motion,
but
nonetheless
at
the
trial
had
held
that
malice
is
an
issue.
manslaughter
is
an
issue,
and
gave
an
instruction
on
manslaughter.
on
direct
appeal,
one
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
evidence
of
pre-meditation
and
deliberation,
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government,
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
other
judges
disagreed.
on
collateral
attack,
again
the
issue
of
prejudice
came
up;
again,
the
question
of
what
is
the
evidence
of
malice,
is
it
clear,
is
it
not
clear,
and
the
panel
held
below
that
the
evidence
of
malice
was
equivocal.
on
en
banc
review
there
was
quite
blistering
dissent
by
other
members,
but
the
net
result
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
whole
sustained
the
judgment
of
the
panel,
that
there
was
sufficient
doubt
as
to
the
evidence
of
malice
to
render
multiple
instruction
errors
on
that
issue
sufficiently
prejudicial
to
warrant
relief
in
this
case.
now,
the
question
becomes
what
should
this
court
do
in
light
of
this
divergence
of
opinion
on
this
kind
of
assessment
of
the
facts
and
assessment
of
the
evidence.
i
suggest
that
the
court
take
guidance
from
its
decision
in
the
fisher
case.
this
is
a
district
of
columbia
case,
it's
a
local
case,
and
the
judgments
of
the
judges
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
exercising
the
remaining
vestige
of
their
article
i
jurisdiction
should
be
deferred
to
on
a
question
of
this
kind.
i
admit
there
has
been
sharp
division
of
opinion
on
the
question,
but
i
would
submit
that
under
the
fisher
case
cited
in
our
brief,
that
it
is
not
appropriate
for
this
court--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--you
have
to
pull
it
out
of
the
opinion.
i
admit
that.
but
it
is
very
direct
in
the
fact
that
they
relied
on
their
own
precedents
of
green
and
wharton
the
government
concedes
those
are
non-constitutional
precedents,
and
if
they
are
not
decisions
under
constitutional
law,
what
are
they?
they
are
decisions
under
district
of
columbia
law,
holding
that
the
instructions
given
did
not
properly
inform
the
jury
as
to
what
the
government
had
to
prove
to
establish
the
district
of
columbia
offense
of
murder.
and
that,
your
honor,
is
a
local
question.
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
holdings
in
green
and
wharton,
and
green
and
wharton
were
the
cases
that
the
frady
court
relied
upon
in
granting
relief
in
this
case.
the
question
that
the
government
raises
in
their
petition
asks
this
court
to
hold
that
a
procedural
default
did
occur,
though
district
of
columbia
law
says
one
did
not,
and
that
the
issue
is
absolutely
waived.
where
does
this
waiver
come
from?
rule
30
does
not
impose
a
waiver
because
all
rule
30
does
is
change
the
standard
of
review
from
normal
allegation
of
error
to
plain
error.
it's
not
a
procedural
forfeiture.
this
court
has
recognized
that
principle
in
the
namet
case.
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
the
mere
failure
to
appeal
does
not
result
in
a
procedural
default
changing
the
standard
of
review
on
collateral
attack.
that's
clear
from
fay
v.
noia,
that's
clear
from
kaufman
v.
united
states,
that's
clear
from
humphrey
v.
cady.
all
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
the
mere
failure
to
appeal
does
not
by
itself
carry
implications
for
the
standard
of
review
on
collateral
attack.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
at
least
the
proposition
that
failure
to
appeal
by
itself
does
not
impose
a
procedural
default
changing
the
standard
of
review
on
collateral
attack.
that
principle
was
reaffirmed
in
humphrey
v.
cady,
your
honor.
and
it
is
also
implicit
in
fay
v.
noia,
and
that
indeed
is
what
is
also
left
of
fay
v.
noia,
i
would
maintain.
so
if
we
have
a
situation
where
failure
to
object
at
trial
merely
changes
the
standard
of
review
to
plain
error,
and
failure
to
appeal
does
not
change
the
standard
of
review
at
all,
how
can
the
government
leap
to
the
conclusion
the
failure
to
raise
the
instruction
error
at
trial
somehow
triggers
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
when
the
issue
is
first
raised
on
collateral
attack?
where
the
court
came
to
that
conclusion
in
previous
decision
was
from
the
express
provisions
of
rule
12
in
the
davis
case,
which
expressly
applied
the
standard
of
cause
and
prejudice
to
the
error
raised
there.
and
the
court
extended
that
principle
in
wainwright
v.
sykes
and
francis
v.
henderson
where
the
state
courts
had
held
a
procedural
default
to
have
existed,
and
held
the
claim
absolutely
barred.
there,
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
comity
and
respect
for
the
state
court
rulings
held
that
well,
if
the
states
are
going
to
hold
the
claim
absolutely
barred,
we
will
at
least
require
a
showing
of
cause
and
a
demonstration
of
prejudice,
a
lesser
standard
of
review
than
the
state
court
imposed
in
those
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
i
would
say
it
was
certainly
correct
for
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
to
look
to
rule
52(b)
of
the
criminal
rules
in
determining
the
proper
standard
of
review.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
it
did,
your
honor,
and
i
would
supports
its
analysis.
it
is
clear
that
the
analysis
that
the
court
of
appeals
needed
to
go
through
was
to
say
all
right,
there
appear
to
have
been
two
procedural
failings;
one,
a
failure
to
appeal.
does
that
affect
the
standard
of
review?
humphrey
v.
cady,
kaufman,
fay
v.
noia,
they
say
no.
well,
there
was
another
procedural
failing.
there
was
a
failure
to
object
at
trial.
well,
what's
the
consequence
of
that?
well,
52(b)
says
the
consequence
of
that
is
to
change
the
standard
of
review
to
plain
error
and
analyzing
the
case
under
that
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
granted
relief
and
properly
so.
in
summation,
i
do
maintain
that
since
district
of
columbia
law
affords
relief
here,
the
decision
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
rests
on
an
adequate
independent
ground
of
local
law
and
must
be
affirmed
on
that
basis.
but
second,
even
if
this
court
reaches
the
question
that
the
government
has
raised
in
its
petition,
the
application
of
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
here
is
entirely
inappropriate
since
the
application
of
that
standard
is
premised
on
a
finding
of
a
procedural
default
which
normally
bars
the
claim.
and
since
that
is
not
the
case
with
instructional
errors,
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
extend
davis,
wainwright
v.
sykes
and
francis
v.
henderson
to
this
kind
of
instructional
error,
which
the
court--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--your
honor,
the
ultimate
standard
under
district
of
columbia
law
is
whether
there
is
a
probability
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
i
would
note
that
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
in
the
frady
decision
invoked
that
very
standard
and
held
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
these
instructional
errors
created
a
probability
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
because
they
meant
that
mr.
frady
may
have
been
improperly
convicted
of
murder
when
he
was
only
guilty
of
manslaughter.
now,
this
was
the
point
that
i
was
discussing
previously;
there
is
division
of
opinion
among
the
judges
as
to
whether
in
fact
the
evidence
in
this
case
on
the
question
of
malice
is
such
that
there
was
sufficient
prejudice
to
warrant
relief
under
that
kind
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
standard.
that
is
a
question
which
is
nicely
balanced
among
the
judges,
and
under
the
fisher
case
should
not
be
disturbed
by
this
court.
