justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
cause
number
80-1595,
united
states
versus
frady,
we
have
the
case
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
respondent,
joseph
frady
was
convicted
by
a
jury
of
first
degree
murder
committed
in
1963.
he
was
sentenced
to
death
my
electrocution.
on
appeal,
frady’s
first
degree
murder
conviction
was
affirmed
but
his
death
sentence
was
overturned
and
he
was
resentenced
to
life
in
prison.
the
respondent
initiated
the
present
action
by
moving
in
the
district
court
to
have
his
sentence
vacated
under
section
2255
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
frady
argued
that
after
his
trial
and
appeal
were
over,
other
courts
have
disapproved
portions
of
the
jury
instructions
that
were
used
in
his
case.
frady
claimed
that
the
faulty
instructions
may
have
led
the
jury
at
his
trial
not
to
give
adequate
consideration
to
the
possibility
that
his
crime
was
only
manslaughter
rather
than
premeditated
and
deliberate
murder.
the
district
court
denied
frady's
motion
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed.
the
court
concluded
that
at
least
in
the
light
of
the
later
cases
decided
after
frady's
trial,
the
jury
instructions
had
been
plainly
erroneous.
relying
on
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
52(b),
the
court
vacated
frady's
sentence.
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
invoked
the
"plain
error"
standard
in
considering
frady's
belated
collateral
attack
on
the
sentence.
we
now
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
“plain
error”
standard
was
intended
for
use
on
direct
appeal
only
and
is
out
of
place
when
a
prisoner
launches
a
collateral
attack
against
a
criminal
conviction,
after
the
judgment
has
been
final
and
has
been
affirmed
on
appeal.
in
1980,
when
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
“plain
error”
standard
to
frady’s
long-delayed
section
2255
motion,
it
acted
as
though
the
clock
had
been
turned
back
to
1965
when
frady's
case
was
first
before
the
court
on
direct
appeal.
in
effect,
the
court
allowed
frady
to
take
a
second
appeal
15
years
after
the
first
was
decided.
the
proper
standard
for
review
of
frady's
motion
is
the
“cause
and
actual
prejudice”
standard
enunciated
by
this
court
in
wainwright
versus
sykes
and
other
cases.
applying
the
standard
to
frady's
case,
despite
the
use
of
jury
instructions
later
found
to
be
faulty,
we
hold
that
frady
suffered
no
actual
prejudice
of
the
degree
sufficient
to
justify
vacating
his
sentence
19
years
after
his
crime.
we
find
no
risk
of
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
in
this
case
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissent.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens,
who
joins
the
opinion
for
the
court,
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
