mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
march
1963
thomas
bennett
was
beaten
and
stomped
to
death
in
his
home.
respondent
and
a
co-defendant
were
apprehended
after
emerging
from
bennett's
home
by
police
officers
called
to
the
scene
by
neighbors.
they
were
covered
with
bennett's
blood
and
co-defendant
gordon
had
just
discarded
on
the
street
a
wallet
that
was
taken
from
bennett.
in
november
1963,
respondent
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
of
robbery,
and
sentenced
to
death
by
the
jury.
on
his
appeal,
the
case
was
heard
by
the
en
banc
d.c.
circuit,
which
reversed
the
sentence
of
death
for
procedural
improprieties,
but
affirmed
the
conviction
of
first
degree
murder.
after
a
series
of
unsuccessful
collateral
attacks
on
his
conviction
and
one
successful
one
relating
to
his
sentence,
respondent
commenced
the
present
proceeding
in
1979,
nearly
16
years
after
he
had
been
convicted.
the
challenge
in
this
proceeding
is
certain
instructions
which
were
given
to
the
jury
at
his
trial
on
the
element
of
malice,
which
is
one
of
the
elements
of
first
degree
murder.
now,
specifically,
the
instructions
that
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
were
three.
the
first
was
the
instruction
given
in
sandstrom
that
a
person
is
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
his
act.
the
court
did
not
rely
on
this
instruction
as
a
ground
for
reversal.
i'm
looking
at
page
27
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
page
28.
the
second
part
of
the
malice
instruction
that
was
troublesome
was
the
statement
that
in
determining
whether
a
wrongful
act
is
intentionally
done
and
is
therefore
done
with
malice
aforethought...
you
should
again
bear
in
mind.
now,
it
is
correct,
as
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
recognized
several
years
after
its
decision
on
frady's
original
appeal,
that
this
is
an
improper
statement
because
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
an
intentional
act
is
therefore
done
with
malice.
similarly,
in
discussing
the
significance
of
the
use
of
a
weapon
in
this
case,
on
page
28
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
district
court
said
"the
law
infers
or
presumes
from
the
use
of
such
weapon,
in
the
absence
of
explanatory
or
mitigating
circumstances,
the
existence
of
the
malice
essential
to
culpable
homicide.
"
that
instruction
also
was
disapproved
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
subsequent
cases.
no
objection
was
made
by
counsel
to
any
of
these
instructions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure.
i
will
come
back
to
the
instructions
in
a
moment
because
there's
another
point
i
want
to
make
about
them,
but
first
i'd
like
to
summarize
for
the
court
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
ordering
that
habeas
corpus
relief
be
granted
to
respondent
in
this
case.
first
it
held,
citing
this
court's
opinion
in
davis
v.
united
states,
that
the
standard
of
review
of
such
a
claim
on
collateral
attack
is
plain
error
under
rule
52(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
secondly,
it
held
that
if
the
standard
is
not
plain
error,
but
rather
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
of
davis
and
of
wainwright
v.
sykes,
then
that
was
satisfied.
the
cause
prong
satisfied
because
it
would
have
been
futile
to
object
to
these
instructions
because
they
were
standard
at
the
time
they
were
given;
the
prejudice
prong
essentially
satisfied
because
of
the
court's
conclusion
that
it
was
not
clearly
harmless
error
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case;
it
might
have
affected
the
jury's
verdict.
then
the
only
remaining
question
in
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
was
whether
the
decisions
in
which
the
d.c.
circuit
recognized
these
errors
in
the
standard
jury
instructions
should
be
applied
retroactively,
and
the
court
held,
relying
on
hankerson
v.
north
carolina,
that
because
they
relate
to
the
jury's
determination
of
factual
guilt
or
innocence,
they
do
have
to
be
applied
retroactively.
now,
the
decision,
in
our
view,
incorporates
a
number
of
serious
errors.
to
characterize
its
result,
i
would
say
that
first,
it
completely
erases
the
distinction
between
direct
and
collateral
attack
in
the
federal
system.
secondly,
it
renders
the
requirements
of
contemporaneous
objection
in
rule
30
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
a
dead
letter.
and
it
attaches
to
each
new
decision
altering
the
rules
of
evidence
or
the
proper
form
of
jury
instructions
the
consequence
of
invalidating
large
numbers
of
prior
convictions
obtained
before
the
new
decision
was
handed
down.
before
i
address
the
questions
that
the
court
of
appeals
addressed,
i'd
like
to
pause
for
a
moment
on
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
constitutional
or
a
non-constitutional
error.
this
is
something
of
a
morass
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
it
totally,
but
it
is
significant
because
if
it's
not
a
constitutional
error,
then
the
failure
to
raise
this
point
on
appeal
would
appear
to
foreclose
the
issue
under
this
court's
holding
in
sunal
v.
large.
secondly,
if
it's
not
a
constitutional
error,
while
that
does
not
absolutely
foreclose
relief
under
2255,
the
standard
announced
in
davis
two
is
that
you
must
have
a
fundamental
defect
inherently
resulting
in
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice.
now,
that
standard,
it
seems
to
me,
must
be
different
from
the
harmless
error
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
effectively
applied
in
this
case.
indeed,
if
the
error
is
non-constitutional,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
recognizing
the
error,
is
not
significantly
different
from
a
statute
that
would
be
passed
by
congress
to
correct
what
it
viewed
as
an
improper
jury
instruction,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
could
seriously
contend
that
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
in
1967,
that
frady
would
be
able
to
come
in
and
invoke
that
statute
as
grounds
for
collateral
relief.
now,
i
think
the
error
here
was
not
of
constitutional
magnitude,
and
in
this
connection
it
seems
to
me
that
the
important
case
is
sandstrom,
but
what
is
instructive
is
the
contrast
between
sandstrom
and
the
present
case.
in
sandstrom,
the
issue
was
whether
the
defendant,
who
admitted
killing
the
victim,
had
intended
to
kill
the
victim.
and
the
principal
difficulty
that
the
court
found
in
the
instruction
which
was
a
focal
instruction
in
the
case
was
that
it
may
have
caused
reasonable
jurors
to
believe
that
if
his
actions
were
such
as
would
be
likely
to
bring
about
death,
then
they
must
find
sandstrom
guilty,
no
matter
what
they
felt
about
his
own
state
of
mind.
now,
many
of
the
cases
of
this
court,
cupp
v.
naughten,
henerson
v.
kibbe,
united
states
v.
park,
in
discussing
instructions,
enjoin
the
examination
of
the
instruction
in
the
entire
context.
and
without
going
into
it
in
detail
here,
there
was
a
fairly
lengthy
instruction
on
malice,
and
this
instruction
required
the
jury
to
find
that
there
was
a
feeling
of
hatred
or
ill
will
on
the
part
of
the
defendants.
state
of
mind
showing
a
hard
regardless
of
social
duty,
a
mind
deliberately
bent
on
mischief
and
so
on.
and
in
giving
the
sandstrom
instruction
about
the
presumption
that
one
intends
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
his
acts,
the
judge
went
on
to
say
if
a
man
uses
upon
another
an
instrument
of
such
a
nature
and
in
such
a
way
and
under
such
circumstances
that
such
use
would
naturally
and
probably
result
in
death,
then
you
are
not
compelled
to
presume
that
he
intended
to
kill
from
such
acts,
but
has
the
right--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
just
making
the
point
that
in
my
view...
and
i'm
going
to
pass
on
from
this
unless
there
are
any
questions,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
error--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
it
is
built
into
the
question
of
what
the
standard--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
we
didn't
list
that
as
a
question,
but
i
do
think
it
is
material
to
the
court's
consideration
of
whether
the
failure
to
object
at
trial
and
to
raise
the
issue
on
appeal,
which
is
a
question
that
we
did
present,
should
bar
review.
but
let
me
move
on
to
the
question,
if
i
may,
of
whether
plain
error
is
the
proper
standard
for
review
in
a
collateral
attack.
i
think
the
court
has
made
several
fundamental
mistakes
in
reaching
this
conclusion.
the
first
is
that
it
has
turned
the
davis
case
topsy-turvy,
because
what
davis
said
is
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--except
in
the
extraordinary
case
outlined
in
davis.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
even
then
i'm
not
clear
in
light
of
sunal
v.
large
what
effect
the
failure
to
appeal
would
have.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
is
correct
at
least
in--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
believe
it
is.
i
wanted
to
make
the
point,
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
was
not
a
separate
question
whether
it
was
a
constitutional
or
a
non-constitutional
error.
i
did
want
to
make
the
point,
but
i
do
want
to
address
the
question
of
whether
plain
error
is
the
proper
standard.
i
will
assume
in
the
rest
of
my
argument
that
this
is
a
constitutional
error;
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
or
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i'm
not
going
to
assume
that
it
fundamentally
tainted
the
trial
because
i
don't
know
exactly
what
that
means.
i
would
rather
cast
it
in
a...
i
will
assume
that
it
is
an
error
of
a
nature
unlike
the
fourth
amendment
suppression
claim
in
stone
v.
powell
that
might
be
cognizable
in
a
collateral
attack
proceeding,
and
try
to
address
how
the
court
should
evaluate
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
make
an
objection
and
take
an
appeal
at
the
time,
and
in
that
connection,
whether
the
plain
error
standard
is
the
proper
standard,
and
also--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--or
the
wainwright
cause
and
prejudice
standard.
and
secondly,
if
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
is
the
proper
standard,
whether
the
assumed
futility
of
objection
is
a
ground.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
what
the
court
held
below
was
that
davis
dictated
the
plain
error
standard
in
the
federal
context,
because
davis
said
that
you
would
have
no
more
liberal
access
to
collateral
review
than
you
would
have
to
review
on
direct
appeal
in
the
case
of
a
procedural
default,
and
the
court
took
that
as
a
holding
that
you
would
have
equal
access
to
collateral
review
or
to
direct
review.
now,
the
use
of
the
plain
error
standard,
as
i
said,
obliterates
any
distinction
between
collateral
and
direct
review,
and
this
is
the
distinction
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
from
sunal
v.
large
if
not
earlier,
up
to
the
addonizio
case
a
couple
of
terms
ago.
the
second
thing
is
that
obviously,
the
consequences
of
applying
the
plain
error
rule
on
collateral
attack
are
far
more
sweeping
in
a
case
like
this,
potentially
hundreds
of
murder
convictions
are
subject
to
collateral
attack
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
if
you
were
confining
it
to
cases
on
direct
appeal,
you
would
have
a
much
more
limited
impact.
now,--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
doesn't
on
its
face
say
that
it's
limited.
however,--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not
aware
that
you
have
ever
said
so,
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
for
purposes--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it's
treated
as
civil
for
some
purposes,
and
it's
part
of
a
criminal
case
for
other
purposes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it's
civil,
for
instance,
for
purposes
of
the
time
limits
for
petitioners
to
certiorari
and
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
civil.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
even
if
it's
regarded
as
a
continuation
of
the
criminal
case,
a
kind
of
retrospective
look
at
the
case,
the
question
is
what
are
the
appropriate
standards
to
apply
in
making
that
look.
and
i
would
make
the
point
that
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
seems
to
me
to
be
responsive
to
the
issue
that's
presented
as
to
whether
a
procedural
default
should
or
should
not
foreclose
a
claim
on
collateral
attack.
because
it
asks
what
are
the
state's
interests
in
enforcing
a
default,
and
what
is
the
defendant's
excuse
for
the
default.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
proper
inquiry
to
be
made.
now,
if
i
can
turn
to
the
question
then
of
presumed
futility
of
objection
as
a
proper
showing
of
cause
under
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard.
this
is
the
key
issue
both
here
and
in
the
previous
case,
and
i
think
underlying
the
viewpoint
of
those
who
find
that
futility
of
objection
should
be
cause
is
the
view
that
it's
not
fair
to
defendants
and
to
their
lawyers
to
expect
them
to
anticipate
rulings
that
are
not
evident
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
now,
it
has
a
certain
superficial
appeal,
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
justified
on
close
analysis,
and
of
course,
i
remind
the
court,
as
counsel
for
ohio
says,
that
the
consequences
of
applying
it
in
the
collateral
attack
context
can
be
very
grave
indeed
in
terms
of
the
numbers
of
cases
that
would
be
affected.
now,
proper
analysis
of
this
issue
seems
to
me
to
require
consideration
of
several
subissues.
the
first
question
is
what
constitutes
futility;
is
it
that
the
trial
court
would
likely
reject
the
objection;
is
it
that
you
have
no
prospect
of
succeeding
on
appeal;
is
it
that
you
have
no
prospect
in
this
court?
i
would
say
when
you're
dealing
with
a
federal
law
or
constitutional
issue,
short
of
an
authoritative
holding
by
this
court
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
characterize
any
ruling
as
futile
to
object
to.
the
second
question
is,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
lawyer
in
this
particular
case
actually
refrained
from
objecting
on
account
of
a
judgement
that
he
made
regarding
futility.
there's
no
evidence
that
that
was
the
basis
for
the
failure
to
object
in
this
case.
and
there
are
two
possibilities.
one
is
to
do
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
presume
that
all
lawyers
who
didn't
raise
this
objection
did
so
because
they
thought
it
would
be
futile,
in
which
case
many
defendants
will
be
getting
relief
on
a
purely
windfall
basis
totally
unrelated
to
the
actual
reason
for
the
default.
or
the
alternative
is
to
conduct
what
will
be,
i
think,
a
very
difficult
and
taxing
inquiry
into
the
lawyer's
actual
motives
in
not
making
an
objection
to
something
that
was
potentially
objectionable.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
next
question
which
is,
does
it
matter
whether
the
lawyer
was
right
or
wrong
in
his
decision
that
it
would
have
been
futile.
in
our
view,
the
respondent
should
not
prevail
in
either
case.
let
me
say
preliminarily
that
any
assumption
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
indulged
that
respondent's
counsel
was
right
in
judging
that
it
would
have
been
futile
to
object
seems
to
me
completely
unsupportable
because
the
court
of
appeals,
shortly
thereafter,
in
fact
observed
on
its
own
these
errors,
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so
it
noted
that
it
must
have
been
just
a
slip
of
tongue
by
the
judge,
which
surely
would
have
been
corrected
if
he
had
noted
it.
now,
if
the
lawyer's
assumption
that
it
would
be
futile
to
object
was
wrong,
then
it
seems
to
me
his
mistake
is
no
different
from
many
others
that
defense
lawyers,
being
human,
make
during
the
course
of
a
criminal
trial.
for
example,
the
failure
to
call
a
helpful
witness,
the
failure
to
pursue
a
line
of
cross
examination
that
would
have
been
useful,
or
many
other
things.
now,
the
standard
for
assessing
whether
such
mistakes
justify
a
new
trial
on
collateral
relief,
i
think,
is
the
sixth
amendment
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
standard.
and
in
response
to
the
question
that
justice
white
asked
during
the
last
argument,
my
view
is
that
it
is
not,
i
think,
correct
to
equate
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer
in
raising
a
useful
claim
with
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
mistake
may
be
of
such
a
magnitude
and
may
have
such
a
fundamental
effect
in
undermining
the
defendant's
prospects
of
success
at
trial
and
be
so
prejudicial
that
in
all
the
circumstances,
the
court
will
judge
it
to
be
a
constitutional
violation.
in
any
event,
my
point
here
is
simply
that
a
mistaken
judgment
about
the
futility
of
raising
an
objection
is
really
no
different
from
any
other
kind
of
mistake
that
a
defense
lawyer
can
make.
now,
i
note
in
this
connection
that
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
does
perform
a
very
important
function
because
by
insisting
on
a
contemporaneous
objection,
you
do
improve
the
chance
that
the
error
will
be
avoided
or
corrected
at
the
trial,
that
it
will
not
occur.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
a
statute
that
was
being
interpreted,
but
that's
the
policy
that
underlies
the
statute
in
large
part.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
davis
one
is
different
from
this
case
because
it
involved
the
grand
jury
question
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
determining
process
in
the
sense
that
this
case
arguably
does.
i
assume
my
brother
will
suggest
that
it
has
a
substantial
effect.
i
don't
agree,
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
i
think
it
does
express
a
policy.
it
doesn't
explain
what
cause
means
and
what
prejudice
means,
but
it
certainly
reflects
a
policy
which
this
court
has
adopted,
that
there
has
to
be
an
excuse
for
a
procedural
default
before
the
habeas
corpus
defendant
will
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
seek
relief.
he
has
to
justify
it.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
now;
is
what
constitutes
this
sufficient
justification.
and
i
have
indicated
that
in
my
view,
a
mistaken
belief
that
it
would
be
futile
to
object
cannot
possible
be
a
sufficient
justification.
so
let's
now
turn
to
the
perhaps
more
difficult
question;
that
is,
assuming
that
the
lawyer
is
right
in
his
view
that
that
objection
would
be
futile,
whatever
is
necessary
to
satisfy
that...
let's
say
the
situation
in
sunal
v.
large
where
the
appellate
second
circuit
had
definitively
rejected
claims
by
other
defendants,
and
this
court
had
denied
certiorari
on
those
claims.
so
let
us
say,
if
it
can
ever
be
said,
that
the
lawyer
is
correct
in
assuming
futility.
nevertheless,
substantial
reasons
exist
for
enforcing
the
procedural
default
and
for
not
treating
this
accurate
assessment
of
futility
as
cause.
first
of
all,
i
come
back
to
the
consequences
of
a
rule
that
does
treat
it
as
cause
whenever
you
have
a
change
in
the
law.
whenever
you
have
a
change
in
the
law
with
regard
to
a
proper
instruction,
with
regard
to
a
commonly
occurring
evidentiary
ruling,
with
regard
to
any
of
the
things
that
may
come
up
at
trial
with
some
frequency,
the
effect
of
saying
that
the
lawyer
couldn't
have
known
that
the
law
would
change
and
therefore,
everybody
who
had
this
issue
treated
adversely
to
them
in
their
trial
is
entitled
to
collateral
relief
is
quite
substantial.
and
that,
i
think,
was
the
point
of
footnote
8
in
hankerson.
it
was
an
effort
to
confine
this
effect,
while
still
recognizing
the
retroactivity
that
people
who
had
felt
the
claim
was
important
enough
that
they
were
going
to
raise
it
and
try
to
insist
upon
it
and
try
to
get
it
litigated,
the
court
felt
it
was
not
fair
to
deprive
them
of
the
benefit,
but
the
people
who
didn't,
this
was
a
limiting
principle
that
i
think
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
secondly,
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
there
is
no
penalty
attached
to
the
default,
that
if
a
lawyer
looks
at
a
particular
issue
that
he
might
raise
and
says
there's
no
point
in
my
raising
it,
therefore
i
won't,
and
if
it's
all
right
for
him
to
say
that
and
he
has
full
access
to
collateral
attack
when
somebody
else
does
raise
it
and
does
prevail,
you've
removed
the
incentives
to
counsel
for
raising
claims
that
may
bring
about
improvements
in
the
law.
in
fact,
if
somebody
who
raised
it,
as
in
davis
two,
and
lost...
if
somebody
who
raised
it
and
lost
might
be
foreclosed
on
the
ground
of
law
of
the
case,
but
somebody
who
didn't
raise
it
would
have
access
to
collateral
relief,
you
would
actually
have
created
some
disincentives
to
raising
claims
like
this.
another
point
about
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
and
the
reliance
on
the
default
as
a
ground
for
foreclosing
access
to
collateral
relief,
is
that
a
contemporaneous
objection
is
one
of
the
best
ways
we
have
of
judging
whether
the
issue
was
important
to
the
defense
in
the
context
of
the
particular
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
cannot
indulge
the
assumption
that
every
potential
issue
that
was
in
a
case
on
which
the
law
at
some
time
in
the
future
changes,
indulge
the
assumption
that
that
was
important
to
the
defendant
and
justifies
giving
him
collateral
relief,
even
though
he
didn't
say
a
peep
about
it
at
trial
and
he
didn't
raise
it
on
appeal.
now,
if
i
can
sum
up,
the
issue
here
is
a
balance
between
the
interests
of
our
system
in
finality
in
criminal
cases
against
the
concern
in
our
system
that
substantial
injustice
not
be
done,
that
innocent
defendants
not
be
incarcerated.
these
are
important
values,
and
obviously,
we
don't
insist
on
the
same
degree
of
finality
in
criminal
cases
that
we
do
in
civil
cases.
nevertheless,
it
does
remain
of
significant
value
in
our
system
and
the
court
has
often
recognized
it,
and
it's
not
to
be
overridden
lightly,
but
only
when
there
are
compelling
justifications
for
such
an
action.
this
is
so
even
when
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
are
not
at
all
blameworthy
with
respect
to
some
error
at
trial.
and
i
think
i
can
best
illustrate
this
point
for
you
by
reference
to
the
treatment
of
motions
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
if
you
have
newly
discovered
evidence
which
raises
some
question
about
the
defendant's
guilt;
that
is,
it
might
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
there
are
two
points
to
notice
about
it.
first
of
all,
if
the
lawyer
did
not
exercise
due
diligence
in
discovering
this
evidence,
even
though
the
client
is
in
no
way
to
blame
for
this,
relief
of
new
trial
is
foreclosed
for
the
lack
of
due
diligence.
this
is
to
ensure
that
the
trial
itself
is
the
main
event,
as
the
court
said
in
wainwright,
and
not
a
tryout
on
the
road.
that
is
analogous
to
the
lawyer
who
mistakenly
thinks
that
an
objection
would
be
futile.
now,
even
where
the
newly
discovered
evidence
could
not
have
been
found
in
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
and
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
are
therefore
in
no
way
to
be
blamed,
the
witness
comes
back
from
tibet
and
suddenly
discloses
information,
we
don't
apply
a
standard
like
the
court
of
appeals
applied
in
this
case
that
if
it
might
have
affected
the
trial;
the
standard
that
is
applied
is
that
it
would
have
to
probably
have
resulted
in
an
acquittal
before
a
new
trial
is
granted.
now,
this
may
seem
harsh,
but
it
is
the
accommodation
that
our
system
makes
between
two
competing
important
interests;
the
interest
in
finality
and
the
interest
in
not
incarcerating
innocent
defendants.
if
the
court
accepts
the
reasoning
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
this
case,
there
is
no
balance
struck
between
those
interests;
there
is
no
value
afforded
to
finality
in
criminal
cases.
there
is
nothing
but
a
harmless
error
inquiry
in
every
case
when
a
defendant
comes
up
with
some
new
principle
or
some
new
fact
which
he
can
call
to
the
court's
attention
years
and
years
later.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
let
me
start
off
by
putting
out
to
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
case
that
you
were
looking
at
was
a
direct
review
case.
we
have
addressed
this
question
of
local
law,
which
i
think
is
a
complete
red
herring,
in
our
reply
brief.
let
me
just
say
that
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
that
remotely
suggests
that
they
would
apply
a
different
rule
if
this
case
had
arisen
as
a
result
of
a
murder
on
the
capitol
grounds
or
some
other
federal
enclave
in
the
district
of
columbia.
secondly,
there
is
nothing
in
the
decisions
of
the
local
courts
that
remotely
suggests
that
they
would
excuse
a
procedural
default
on
collateral
attack.
what
there
is
are
decisions
are
saying
that
they
are
going
to
strictly
enforce
procedural
defaults
on
direct
appeal,
and
only
consider
under
the
plain
error
standard
a
very
limited
category
of
cases.
it
is
difficult,
i
think
impossible,
to
convert
that
into
an
understanding
that
they
would
be
very
liberal
with
such
claims
on
collateral
attack.
now,
with
regard
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
whether
this
is
like
an
adequate
state
ground
claim,
it
is
not
like
an
adequate
state
ground
claim
because
the
district
of
columbia
courts
are
not
state
courts,
and
in
fact,
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
the
highest
expositor
of
district
of
columbia
law,
even
local
law
questions,
as
i
learned
somewhat
to
my
chagrin
in
the
whalen
case
a
few
years
ago--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
but
as
i
say,
the
last--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
are
cases,
southall
realty.
but
in
whalen
there
was
no
reluctance
to
review
a
purely
local
law
question.
the
point
is
you
can
review
it.
in
this
case
i
don't
think
it's
material
because--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
just
saying--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
just
saying
it
is
a
little
different
from
an
independent
state
ground
question.
now,
on
the
question
of
harmless
error,
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked,
i
do
think
that
it
may
have
been
that
if
this
objection
had
been
preserved
at
trial
and
raised
on
direct
appeal,
there
would
be
arguably
be
a
close
question
i
think
as
to
whether
the
error
would
be
harmless
and
the
conviction
ought
nevertheless
to
be
affirmed.
the
instruction
on
manslaughter
was
given
because
there
was
some
evidence
which
the
jury
might
not
have
credited
about
premeditation
involving
the
driving
by
the
premises
beforehand,
the
picking
up
and
putting
on
gloves
before
they
went
into
the
premises,
the
conversation
at
the
restaurant
and
so
on.
now,
let
me
close
on
the
question
of
futility
and
the
point
about
the
effect
of
a
failure
to
appeal.
i
don't
often
quote
justice
douglas
but
in
this
case
i
think
his
words
in
sunal
v.
large
are
appropriate.
he
discussed
the
question
of
assumed
futility
and
he
said
he
did
not
think...
i
see
my
time
is
up,
so
you
can
read
it
for
yourselves.
thank
you.
