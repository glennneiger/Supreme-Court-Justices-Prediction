80-518,
u.s.
industries
against
the
director
of
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs,
the
department
of
labor.
this
workmen's
compensation
case
arising
out
of
an
incident
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
workmen's
compensation
law
is
governed
by
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act.
the
respondent
awoke
in
the
early
morning
of
november
20,
1975
with
a
very
severe
pain
in
his
neck,
shoulders,
and
arms
which
were
later
attributed
by
doctors
to
an
exacerbation
of
an
arthritic
condition.
he
retained
a
lawyer
and
filed
a
workmen's
compensation
claim
in
which
he
alleged
that
he
suffered
an
accident
the
preceding
day
at
work
while
working
on
duct
work
and
that
that
accident
was
what
gave
rise
to
his
injury.
there
was
a
hearing
held
in
which
the
hearing
examiner
concluded
that
no
accident
had
in
fact
occurred
and
that
the
testimony
of
the
respondent
was
not
to
be
believed.
the
benefits
review
board
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
compensation
and
he
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
reversed
and
held
that
even
though
he
failed
to
prove
that
the
particular
accident
on
which
he
relied
had
occurred
that
nevertheless
the
pain
that
he
suffered
in
the
morning
when
he
awoke
at
home
was
an
injury
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
to
which
a
presumption
of
compensability
apply
and
held
that
therefore
the
employer
had
a
duty
to
rebut
the
possibility
that
the
pain
arose
as
a
result
of
something
that
happened
at
work.
we
granted
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
and
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
two
errors
in
its
disposition
of
the
case,
first,
by
applying
the
statutory
presumption
of
compensability
to
a
claim
that
the
respondent
had
not
himself
advanced
but
rather
was
not
made
properly
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
and
secondly,
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
correctly
define
the
term
injury
which
under
the
statute
refers
to
harm
that
arises
out
of
in
the
course
of
employment
and
the
court
of
appeals
rather
treated
the
injury
as
though
it
was
the
harm
that
happened
at
home.
and
therefore,
in
the
opinion
we
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
