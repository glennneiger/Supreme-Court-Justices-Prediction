mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
as
counsel
has
indicated,
the
respondent
supports
the
judgement
below
on
alternative
grounds.
first,
we
support
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
two
occasions,
the
occasion
of
the
interlocutory
appeal
and
the
present
appeal,
that
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
of
speedy
trial
was
violated
in
this
case.
alternatively,
and
independently,
we
urge
that
the
trial
prejudice
which
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
after
its
very
full
examination
of
the
record
warrants
a
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
as
well,
though
it
is
quite
true
that
the
court
of
appeals,
having
decided
as
it
did
the
sixth
amendment
question,
stated
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
it
to
decide
the
fifth
amendment
issue.
it
did
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
issues
of
trial
prejudice.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
district
court
concluded
that
it
had
conducted
a
fair
trial.
that
is
quite
so,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
accepted
the
jury's
verdict,
certainly.
i
would
like
to
address
first
the
sixth
amendment
issue
of
a
speedy
trial
guarantee.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
the
findings
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
trial
prejudice
would
warrant
an
affirmance
on
that
ground.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
numerous
claims
of
trial
error
which
the
court
of
appeals
never
reached.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
there
was
a
reversal
of
the
judgment,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
counsel
has
indicated
the
sequence
of
events
in
this
case,
that
the
military
made
charges
in
the
spring
of
1970,
they
were
investigated
for
a
period
of
some
six
months
by
an
army
investigating
officer,
charges
having
been
brought
by
the
military.
he
made
an
elaborate
report,
finding
that
the
charges
were
not
true
and
recommending
that
the
civilian
authorities
investigate
the
involvement
of
one
helena
stokley,
of
whom
i
will
say
more
later,
in
connection
with
the
issue
of
trial
prejudice.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
under
the
marion
case,
the
public
accusation
makes
the
difference.
that
triggers,
as
the
court
there
held,
the
speedy
trial
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
think
the
court
put
it
that
arrest
triggers
the
provision
even
though
there
has
been
no
formal
indictment,
and
so
our
case
so
far
as
the
sixth
amendment
is
concerned
rests
upon
the
proposition
that
there
had
been
an
arrest,
that
dr.
macdonald
was
held
under
restraint,
that
this
public
accusation
caused
wide
notoriety
and
public
obloquy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
certainly
true,
your
honor,
that
suspicion
may
attach
to
somebody
who
is
under
investigation,
who
hasn't
been
arrested,
who
hasn't
been
formally
charged.
as
with
many
other
constitutional
protections,
so
also,
i
think,
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
of
speedy
trial,
when
a
public
act
is
taken
by
the
sovereign,
protections
that
weren't
previously
available
come
into
play,
and
i
think
marion
makes
quite
clear,
i
think
the
government
doesn't
disagree,
that
the
speedy
trial
provision
was
activated
by
the
arrest
and
the
restraint.
rather,
it
contents
that
it
was
deactivated
during
an
interim
period
between
the
dismissal
of
the
initial
indictment
by
the
military
and
the
pre-indictment
by
the
civilian
authorities.
now,
i
should
say
that
the
department
of
justice
monitored
this
case
from
its
very
beginning.
it
was
hardly
a
case
of
a
dual
prosecution
in
any
sense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
am.
let
me
first,
if
i
may,
point
out
what
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
with
respect
to
the
four
factors
in
barker
against
wingo.
as
to
the
substantiality
of
the
delay,
it
was
a
delay
of
close
to
two
and
one-half
years
after
the
investigation
and
the
re-investigation
and
a
sixth
month
period
to
report
the
result
of
the
investigation
had
taken
place.
as
to
that
two
and
a
half
year
period,
both
panels
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
was
inexcusable,
that
nothing
was
taking
place,
that
the
department
was
letting
the
case
lie
on
the
shelf,
that
it
reflected,
in
the
words
of
judge
murnaghan
below
"a
calloused
and
lackadaisical
attitude"
and
was
irresponsible.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly
when
any
legitimate
prosecutorial
purpose
is
being
served,
that
would
justify
delay.
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
is
that
nothing
was
being
done,
and
it
found
that
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
was
submitted
to
it.
the
united
states
attorney
responsible
for
this
case,
when
asked
why
this
had
been
delayed
more
than
two
years,
said,
just
bureaucracy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
am
suggesting
that
where
a
prosecution
is
initiated
and
then
dismissed,
and
then
there
is
a
continuing
investigation
in
which
the
same
person
is
the
target,
and
that
is
accompanied
by
wide
notoriety
and
he
is
on
notice
that
he
is
still
an
accused
person
because
macdonald
through
his
counsel
was
requesting
throughout
this
period
that
the
department
make
a
resolution
of
the
matter,
i
am
saying
in
those
circumstances
the
interests
implicated
by
the
sixth
amendment
continue
to
play
a
role--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--no.
no,
i
think
in
any
case
where
there
is
the
triggering
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
where
there
is
a
subsequent
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
and
that
is
followed
by
an
inordinate
delay,
that
the
government
has
is
followed
by
an
inordinate
delay,
the
burden
of
establishing
some
plausible
or
legitimate
reason
for
that
delay,
and
the
court
here
found
twice
over
that
the
government
had
not
been
able
to
do
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
am
relying
on
the
fact
that
i
think
is
a
critical
fact
on
the
basis
of
the
marion
decision,
that
here
there
had
been
a
public
accusation,
there
had
been
a
charge,
an
arrest
and
an
indictment
which
was
dismissed.
seven
of
the
federal
circuits
have
considered
in
speedy
trial
cases
periods
that
fell
between
the
dismissal
of
an
initial
indictment
and
a
re-indictment,
and
several
of
those
courts
of
appeals
have
pointed
out
that
if
a
prosecutor
could
avoid
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
speedy
trial
guarantee
by
the
expedient
of
nol
prossing
or
requesting
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
and
then
re-indicting
at
leisure,
that
the
interests
protected
by
the
speedy
guarantee
would
be
thereby
defeated.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
an
inordinate
delay,
that
there
was
no
justification
for
it,
that
the
effects
of
the
initial
charge
continued
unabated,
that
they
caused
stress
and
obloquy,
and
further,
and
i
mean
to
develop
the
question
of
prejudice,
that
the
long
delay
resulted
in
serious
impairment
of
the
defendant's
ability
to
defend
against
the
charges.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
of
course,
there
is
a
societal
interest
in
the
solution
of
all
crimes,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
suggest
otherwise.
i
do
suggest
that
there
is
not
a
societal
interest
in
neglect,
in
inordinate
delay,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
have
taken
place
here,
because
that
exposes
the
individual
to
all
the
dangers,
the
pressures
and
the
dangers
of
impairment
of
his
defense
against
which
the
speedy
trial
guarantee
is
designed
to
safeguard
one.
i
wanted
to
conclude
my
reference
to
the
barker
against
wingo
factors.
i
have
mentioned
the
substantiality
of
the
delay,
the
court's
findings
as
to
reasons
for
delay.
it
also
found,
as
i
think
the
court
is
aware,
that
dr.
macdonald
persistently
asserted
his
right
to
have
the
matter
promptly
resolved,
and
that
brings
me
then
to
the
question
of
prejudice,
and
i
am
going
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
prejudice
at
trial,
quite
apart
from
the
factors
of
pretrial
prejudice,
the
matters
of
stress,
anxiety,
financial
expenditure.
dr.
macdonald's
account
of
the
crime
was
that
his
home
was
invaded
by
four
intruders.
no
motives
for
charging
him
with
this
crime
have
ever
been
suggested
or
shown.
dr.
macdonald
stated
that
he
was
first
attacked.
he
in
fact
was
found
to
have
suffered
17
wounds,
one
that
penetrated
to
the
lung.
the
government's
theory
when
it
finally
brought
the
case
by
going
to
the
grand
jury
almost
five
years
after
the
crime
had
occurred
was
based
entirely
upon
a
hypothetical
reconstruction
of
the
crime.
the
government
produced
experts
who
testified
that
in
various
particulars,
physical
artifacts,
laboratory
tests
showed
inconsistencies
between
dr.
macdonald's
account
and
their
findings.
let
me
refer
the
court--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--no,
there
is
no
indication
of
that,
your
honor.
dr.
macdonald
was
initially
attacked,
and--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--i
thought
your
honor
was
referring
in
the
nature
of
the
wounds
to
the
kind
of
instrument
that
might
have
been
used.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
was
testimony
that
the
wounds
that
dr.
macdonald
suffered,
like
those
that
were
true
of
the
wounds
suffered
by
the
other
members
of
the
family,
had
been
caused
by
a
sharp
instrument.
dr.
macdonald's
account
was
that
he
was
severely
attached,
whether
the
intruders,
we
don't
know.
he
was
rendered
unconscious,
thought
that
he
had
likewise
been
killed.
we
don't
know.
certainly
the
wound
that
penetrated
to
the
lung
was
a
life-threatening
one
which
raised
serious
questions
as
to
whether
that
could
have
been
or
would
have
been
self-inflicted--
i
want
to
refer
the
court,
if
i
may,
to
the
court
of
appeals
finding
based
upon
its
full
examination
of
this
lengthy
record,
and
it
was
a
six
or
seven-week
trial.
the
court
found
there
was
almost
certain
memory
erosion
on
the
part
of
the
government's
investigators.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
do
you
want
me
to
locate
that,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
will
provide
the
reference.
i
think...
well,
if
i
may,
i
will
provide
the
reference
in
a
moment,
your
honor.
it
said
"almost
certain
memory
erosion",
and
this
is
a
quotation
that
i
am
reading
from
in
my
brief,
"on
the
part
of
the
government's
investigators.
"
and
that
this,
an
i
quote
again,
"rendered
it
virtually
impossible"
for
th
defense
to
probe
their
recollections
and
to
test
th
premises
and
assumptions
upon
which
their
"scientific
speculation",
and
scientific
speculation
"is
again
the
language
of
the
court,
rested.
"
now,
in
a
case
in
which
the
government's
whole
case
rests
upon
a
hypothetical
reconstruction,
i
think
a
finding
that
the
defendant's
ability
to
test
that
case
effectively
by
cross
examination
was
rendered
virtually
impossible
is
certainly
a
finding
of
severe
prejudice
which
goes
to
the
issue
of
due
process,
as
well,
of
course,
as
t
the
issue
of
prejudice
if
the
court
decides
that
the
sixth
amendment
here
applies.
but
i
would
like
to
talk
about
a
more
concrete
instance
of
trial
prejudice
to
which
the
trial
court...
i
am
sorry,
the
court
of
appeals
also
adverted.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
a
divided
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
think
that
reflects
a
division
on
the
court
as
to
the
sixth
amendment
issue.
the
opinions
don't
indicate
that
they
were
seriously
addressing
the
alternative
claim
that
i
am
now
advancing.
dr.
macdonald,
when
the
military
police
arrived
following
his
call
for
help
gave
a
description
of
the
four
intruders.
one
of
them,
he
said,
was
a
woman;
the
other
three,
males.
he
described
the
woman
as
having
blonde
hair,
wearing
a
white
floppy
hat...
this
was
february,
mind
you...
and
boots.
he
described
one
of
the
other
men
as
a
black
male
wearing
an
army
type
field
jacket
with
sergeant
stripes.
based
on
that
description,
a
fayetteville
police
officer
who
was
called
into
the
case
prompted
by
the
military
police
decided
that
he
thought
he
knew
who
that
woman
was.
that
officer,
an
officer
named
beasley,
had
used
helene
stokley
as
a
drug
informant.
helene
stokley
was
the
daughter
of
an
army
colonel
at
fort
bragg
who
had
left
home
promptly
after
graduating
from
high
school,
had
entered
the
drug
culture
in
fayetteville.
beasley
went
to
stokley,
because
he
knew
that
the
description
that
dr.
macdonald
gave
seemed
to
answer
her
description,
and
he
knew
further
that
her
close
friend
and
associate
was
a
black
male
who
typically
wore
an
army
type
field
jacket
with
e-6
stripes.
promptly
when
he
went
to
see
stokley,
she
admitted...
i
said
in
the
brief
it
is
a
hedged
admission,
and
i
think
that
is
a
fair
characterization.
she
said,
i
had
it
in
my
mind
that
i
was
there,
but
i
was
heavy
on
mescaline,
which
is,
of
course,
a
narcotic.
two
or
three
days
later,
helene
stokley's
neighbor,
one
posey,
who
had
seen
her
returning
to
her
home
at
about
5:00
a.m.
on
the
morning
of
february
17th,
and
the
crime
took
place
during
the
hours
between
midnight
and
5:00
a.m.,
posey
spoke
to
helene
stokley,
and
she
told
him
that
she
had
held
the
light
during
the
commission
of
the
crime,
but
that
she
herself
would
not
kill
anybody.
dr.
macdonald
had
told
the
military
police
when
they
arrived
on
the
scene
that
the
female
intruded
had
a
flickering
light
on
her
face
as
if
she
were
holding
a
candle.
some
time
later,
stokley
was
interviewed
by
an
army
cid
agent
named
brisentine.
she
told
brisentine
that
she
had
been
involved,
and
she
spoke
of
blood
on
the
bed,
and
the
words
"kill
the
pigs"
had
been
written
on
the
headboard
of
the
bed
in
the
macdonald
home.
she
told
him
further
that
she
would
name
the
participants
in
this
crime
if
granted
immunity.
she
was
not
granted
immunity,
of
course.
stokley
in
all
made
admissions
to
seven
different
out
of
court
auditors,
acquaintances,
friends,
law
enforcement
officers.
many
of
these
admissions,
in
fact
i
think
i
might
say
all
of
these
admissions,
were
fragmentary,
and
she
would
immediately
equivocate
for
reasons
that
are
obvious.
she
would
make
an
admission,
apparently
impelled
by
the
feeling
that
she
needed
to
relieve
herself
of
her
feelings,
and
then
she
would
promptly
turn
around
and
say,
well,
i
won't
say
any
more,
i
have
already
said
too
much.
let
me
now
turn
to
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
stokley's
testimony.
the
court
said
that
the
failure
of
stokley
to
verify,
because
stokley
when
she
took
the
stand
claimed
she
no
longer
remembered
what
had
happened
on
the
night
in
question,
the
failure
to
verify
dr.
macdonald's
account
from
the
witness
stand
may
well
have
been
disastrous
to
the
defense.
had
she
testified,
judge
murnaghan
goes
on,
"as
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
she
might
have
testified,
the
injury
to
the
government's
case
would
have
been
incalculably
great.
"
and
then
he
adds
that
the
reason
she
asserted
under
oath
was
failure
of
memory,
and
finally,
that
the
government's
inexcusable
delay
was
a
probable
cause
of
the
defendant's
inability
to
get
an
account
from
her
when
she
took
the
stand.
stokley,
incidentally,
did
acknowledge
that
she
remembered
where
she
had
been
at
midnight
on
february
17th.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
am
going
to
deal
further
in
a
few
moments,
if
i
may,
to
some
of
the
circumstances
which
corroborate,
independent
circumstances
that
corroborate
stokley's
admissions.
of
course,
there
are
other
possibilities,
but
the
credibility
of
stokley's
story
was
for
the
jury,
had
she
testified,
and
the
court
has
made
a
finding
here
that
a
probable
cause
of
her
not
appearing
to
testify
before
the
jury,
at
least
as
to
these
matters,
was
the
long
delay
for
which
the
government
was
responsible.
now,
it
is
perfectly
true
also
that
there
is
another
possibility,
that
she
may
have
been
feigning
when
she
was
called
into
the
public
forum
a
lack
of
memory
as
to
these
events,
because
she
did
remember
where
she
was
at
midnight,
and
she
did
remember
returning
to
her
home
at
5:00
a.m.,
so
it
appears
that
she
was
abroad
during
this
five
hours
when
the
crime
took
place,
and
nobody
has
ever
offered
any
innocent
explanation
of
that
activity.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
wouldn't
suggest
it
was
unique.
i
think
it
was
probably
commonplace.
it
also
appeared
from
the...
one
of
stokley's
admissions
that
she
had
testified...
i
am
sorry,
she
had
stated
out
of
court
that
one
of
the
parties
to
this
crime
had
been
driving
a
blue
mustang,
and
she
was
seen
by
posey
returning
at
5:00
a.m.
in
a
blue
car
with
several
men.
so,
there
is
a
loss
of
stokley's
testimony.
she
was
called
a
witness,
and
she
claimed
she
could
no
longer
remember
ten
years
later
what
had
taken
place,
and
she
denied
any
recollection
of
all
the
out
of
court
statements
that
she
had
made
to
the
various
auditors
who
heard
those
admissions
against
interest.
i
was
about
to
say,
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
is
also
the
possibility
that
she
was
feigning
loss
of
memory
on
the
stand.
i
don't
think
that
would
alter
the
conclusion
that
the
defendant
was
seriously
prejudiced,
because
it
is
not
possible
to
say
that
she
would
have
had
the
temerity
to
deny
recollection
if
this
trial
had
been
promptly
held,
or
that
the
jury
in
that
circumstances
would
have
credited
her
denial
of
recollection.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
concern
here
is
that
the
stokley
story
never
got
to
the
jury.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
never
heard
the
story.
they
never
heard
what
she
could
have
testified
to,
would
have
testified
to
had
she
testified
in
court
as
she
had
spoken
out
of
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
took
the
stand,
and
then
when
questioned
denied
she
had
any
recollection
of
the
relevant
five-hour
period.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
certainly
said
she
had
been
on
drugs.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
prejudice
that
stokley
was
unavailable
and
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
fact
that
one
could
not
determine
how
she
would
have
testified
had
she
been
promptly
brought
to
the
witness
stand,
could
have
been
cured,
if
the
jury
had
been
permitted
to
hear,
as
we
think
it
should
have
been
permitted
to
hear,
the
admissions
against
interest
that
she
made.
the
trial
court
excluded
the
testimony
of
the
seven
witnesses
who
heard
all
of
these
out
of
court
admissions.
that,
we
submit,
was
an...
that
was
an
indefensible
ruling,
we
believe,
and
one
which
the
government
urged
upon
the
court.
the
district
judge's
reason
for
that
ruling,
as
he
stated
it,
was
that
stokley
was
a
pathetic
figure,
and
she
had
equivocated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
in
this
sense.
perhaps
i
should
modify
that.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
government
may
rule,
having
objected
to
the
admission
of
the
out
of
court
declarations,
but
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
decide
definitively
that
evidentiary
issue.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
issue
would
be
open,
and
i
am
referring
to
the
substance
of
these
out
of
court
declarations--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--for
two
reasons.
one,
to
show
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
unavailability
of
the
stokley
story
which
the
court
of
appeals
attributed
as
a
likely
consequence
of
the
government's
delay.
secondly--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--i
don't
have
to
prove
what
of
course
can't
be
proved
here
in
this
court,
the
truth
of
those
out
of
court
declarations,
to
say
that--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--well,
the
rules
of
evidence
say
that
there
must
be
corroborating
circumstances.
the
rules
of
evidence
do
not
say
that
the
declarant
must
be
a
person
of
good
character
and
habits
rather
than
a
pathetic
figure.
and
here
there
were
repeated
corroborating
circumstances.
the
fact
that
the
very
description
that
macdonald
gave
when
the
police
first
arrived
led
the
police
directly
to
somebody
who
in
turn
made
an
admission
that
she
had
been
there--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--no,
i
think
if
that
question
did
not
go
also
to
the
question
of
due
process,
a
new
trial
would
be
mandated
by--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
unavailability
of
the
stokley
testimony
because
of
her
asserted
loss
of
memory
resulting,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
was
likely
to
be
the
consequence
of
the
long
delay,
that
that
was
compounded
when
it
could
have
been
allayed
or
cured
had
the
government
not
insisted
and
successfully
insisted
upon
the
exclusion
of
this
critical
evidence.
here
was
the
one
identified
living
person
other
than
the
defendant
who
could
have
spoken
to
the
question
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
his
account,
evidence,
i
think,
that
any
observer
of
this
case
would
regard
as
the
most
critical
in
deciding
whether
there
was
truth
to
dr.
macdonald's
account,
and
the
jury
never
heard
a
particle
of
that
testimony.
thank
you,
your
honor.
