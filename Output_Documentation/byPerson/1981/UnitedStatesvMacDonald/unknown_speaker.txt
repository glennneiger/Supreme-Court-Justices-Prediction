unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
he
has
remarried?
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
is
that
massive
report,
as
you
referred
to
it,
is
that
lodged
here
with
the
court?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
respondent
now?
is
he
incarcerated?
unknown
speaker
say
that
again.
he
is
free
on
bail,
what?
unknown
speaker
and
who
freed
him?
unknown
speaker
bail
was
denied
at
one
time,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
judge
dupree
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
there
was
prejudice
as
a
result
of
the
delay?
unknown
speaker
if
the
government
was
completely
free,
why
did
they
make
this
long
report
to
the
department
of
justice?
unknown
speaker
they
still
were
considering
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
there
is
some
comment
in
the
briefs
about
a
change
in
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowizt,
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant
by
virtue
of
the
delay.
had
there
been
a
finding
of
prejudice,
would
you
then
feel
that
the
speedy
trial
clause
was
still
inapplicable,
or
would
you
reach
relief
under
the
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
understand
your
position.
you
would
feel
that
it
is
inapplicable
even
if
a
finding
of
prejudice
had
been--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
horowitz,
was
he
aware,
however,
of
the
ongoing
investigation?
does
the
record
show
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
many
cases
are
distinguishable,
because
here
he
had
been
charged,
and
the
charges
were
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
really
mean
he
is
in
a
better
position
than
if
he
had
been
acquitted,
do
you?
if
he
had
been
acquitted,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
some
analogy
to
the
bartkus
against
illinois,
the
dual
sovereignty
concept
of
jeopardy
that
even
though
a
state
may
try
and
acquit,
the
federal
government
may
still
prosecute?
unknown
speaker
certainly
the
defendant
after
he
has
been
acquitted
by
the
state
may
well
learn
that
the
federal
government
is
still
investigating.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
realize
that,
but
i
mean,
as
to
the
factual
matter
of
anxiety
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
or,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggests,
a
fellow
who
has
been
indicted
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
or
even
convicted
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
before
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
then
that
wouldn't
be
a
matter
of
dismissing
the
charges--
unknown
speaker
--but
abandoning
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
due
process
argument.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
sixth
amendment
claim,
then
what
should
this
court
do
with
the
due
process
argument?
does
it
require
any
fact
finding?
unknown
speaker
certainly
justice
harlan's
concurrence
in
klopfer
suggests
that
it
is
just...
was
to
him,
at
any
rate,
almost
a
matter
of
semantics.
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
mr.
horowitz,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
that
if
you
prevail
there
are
still
other
issues
open
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
but
trial
error
is
still
open
o
remand,
wouldn't
it
be?
unknown
speaker
which
were
contrary
to
the
district
court's.
unknown
speaker
that
it
and
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
it
and
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
mr.
spritzer--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
your
submission
that
if
you
don't
prevail
on
the
sixth
amendment
that
we
ought
to
reach
the
other
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
did
address
it
and
didn't
agree
with
you
about
that,
what
is
left
for
determination?
unknown
speaker
so
it
will
have
to
go
back
in
any
event
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
resolution
of
those
questions?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
would
your
case
be
any
different,
ms.
spritzer,
if
no
charges
had
ever
been
brought
by
the
military
process,
and
the
doctor
had
resigned
his
commission
in
the
army
and
gone
back
into
civilian
life,
and
then
all
of
these
other
events
occurred?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
had
been
no
formal
arrest,
and
the
army
had
spent
six
months
investigating
it,
would
not
that
have
been
essentially
the
same
with
or
without
an
arrest?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
it
be
deactivated,
mr.
spritzer?
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
get
to
that.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
doesn't
the
lovasco
case
permit
that
kind
of
a
delay,
while
the
state
weighs
the
evidence,
or
the
prosecuting
authority?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting,
then,
that
in
every
murder
case
brought
by
the
united
states
or
any
prosecution
brought
by
the
united
states,
that
the
courts
are
free
to
weigh
the
diligence
of
the
government
in
bringing
the
case?
unknown
speaker
then
you
want
a
rule
just
for
this
case,
basically.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
suggesting,
in
effect,
that
any
time
there
is
an
ongoing
investigation,
the
subject
of
the
investigation
is
a
de
facto
accused
under
the
fifth
amendment?
or
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
there
aren't
countervailing
societal
interests
in
the
solution
of
a
crime
such
as
this,
would
you,
mr.
spritzer?
unknown
speaker
was
part
of
that
related
to
the
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
wounds
on
the
deceased
people
and
the
nature
of
the
wounds
on
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
one
ultimate
indication,
that
the
three
people
died
of
the
wounds
and
one
didn't.
unknown
speaker
or
whether
they
could
be
self-inflicted.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
that,
mr.
spritzer?
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
just
give
me
the
page.
unless
you
don't
have
it
handy.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
don't
have
it
handy--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you,
mr.
spritzer,
what
was
the
vote
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court--
unknown
speaker
--equally
divided?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
court
of
appeals
also
say
that
the
possible
reasons
why
stokley
did
not
so
testify
are
several,
and
then
in
the
footnote
say
a
likely
one
is
that
she
was
not
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
at
all?
unknown
speaker
in
that
subculture
that
you
have
described
she
was
part
of,
was
there
anything
unique
about
roaming
and
prowling
around
in
those
hours,
as
there
might
be
for
some
other
people
not
part
of
that
subculture?
unknown
speaker
but
those
general
types
of
questions
are
left
to
juries
in
criminal
cases
subject
to
the
motion
for
new
trial,
et
cetera,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that,
too,
is
a
factor
that
is
generally
weighed
by
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
but
she
did
take
the
stand
in
court,
didn't
she?
unknown
speaker
but
she
remembered
why
she
didn't
have
any
recollection.
at
least
she
testified
as
to
why
she
didn't
have
a
recollection.
unknown
speaker
well,
she
remembered
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
she
had
testified
in
court
the
day
after
the
event,
and
she
had
said
the
same
thing,
the
jury
would
have--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we
don't
know
that
she
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
if
you
believe
her
ten
years
later,
that
is
what
she
would
have
testified
to
the
day
after.
unknown
speaker
was
that
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
was
an
indefensible
ruling,
and
if
we
agreed
with
the
government
and
reversed
this
judgment,
that
issue
would
be
open.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
assuming
the
truth
of
what
the
out
of
court
statements
would
have...
you
are
assuming
the
truth
of
what
those
witnesses
would
have
testified.
unknown
speaker
if
they
were
inadmissible,
it
is
because
they
are
unreliable.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
judgment
would
be
that
if
the
case
only
involved
this
evidentiary
issue
and
you
won
on
it,
the
judgment
would
be
reversed,
i
mean,
the
conviction
would
be
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
meant,
a
new
trial.
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
how
many
judges
who
wrote
opinions
in
this
case
found
no
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
it
started
with
the
district
judge.
unknown
speaker
and
only
two
actually
joined
an
opinion
of
prejudice,
as
i
recall.
