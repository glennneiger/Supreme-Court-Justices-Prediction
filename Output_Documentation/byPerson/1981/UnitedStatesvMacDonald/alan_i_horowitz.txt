mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
primary
question
presented
here,
and
the
one
which
i
will
devote
most
of
my
attention
to
in
argument
is
simply
whether
the
speedy
trial
clause
applies
to
a
period
when
a
person
is
under
no
form
of
restraint
and
has
no
charges
pending
against
him.
there
are
also
two
subsidiary
questions
presented
here.
first,
if
the
court
rejects
the
government's
view
that
the
speedy
trial
clause
is
not
applicable
to
such
a
period,
it
is
our
contention
nevertheless
that
the
application
of
the
barker
v.
wingo
factors
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
there
was
no
sixth
amendment
violation
here.
second,
respondent
contends
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
that
in
any
event
the
pre-indictment
delay
here
violated
the
due
process
clause.
the
background
of
this
litigation
is
as
follows.
on
february
17th,
1970,
respondent's
wife
and
two
children
were
bludgeoned
and
stabbed
to
death.
respondent
called
the
military
police,
and
when
they
arrived
at
the
crime
scene,
he
told
them
that
he
had
been
attacked
by
a
group
of
intruders
and
knocked
unconscious,
and
that
when
he
regained
consciousness,
he
discovered
the
bodies
of
his
family.
respondent,
who
gave
investigators
a
detailed
account
of
his
actions
upon
regaining
consciousness,
was
originally
viewed
as
a
victim
of
the
crime,
not
as
a
suspect.
however,
as
the
investigation
proceeded,
and
the
investigators
came
to
realize
that
the
physical
evidence
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
was
inconsistent
with
several
aspects
of
respondent's
story,
he
did
become
a
suspect.
on
april
6th,
1970,
respondent
was
advised
that
he
was
a
suspect.
he
was
relieved
of
his
duties
as
a
physician
and
confined
to
his
quarters.
on
may
1st,
1970,
he
was
charged
with
murder
under
article
30
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
and
pursuant
to
article
32
of
that
code
an
investigating
officer
was
appointed
to
investigate
the
charges
and
recommend
whether
they
should
be
referred
to
a
court
martial
for
trial.
after
a
hearing,
the
investigating
officer
recommended
that
the
charges
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
evidence.
on
october
23rd,
1970,
the
commanding
general
of
respondent's
unit
accepted
the
recommendation
and
dismissed
the
charges
on
the
ground
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
warrant
convening
a
court
martial.
in
december
of
1970,
respondent
was
honorably
discharged
from
the
army,
and
shortly
thereafter
he
moved
to
california
and
established
himself
as
a
practicing
physician.
at
the
justice
department's
request,
the
army--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
don't
think
it
is
in
the
record.
as
far
as
i
know,
he
hasn't.
at
the
justice
department's
request,
the
army
criminal
investigative
division
continued
its
investigation.
cid
submitted
a
massive
report
on
this
investigation
to
the
justice
department
in
june
of
1972,
and
in
response
to
further
specific
inquiries
for
investigation
from
the
department,
it
submitted
supplemental
reports
in
november,
1972,
and
august,
1973.
in
the
summer
of
1974--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
am
not
certain.
i
understand
that
parts
of
it
are
in
the
record
and
are
lodged
with
the
court.
a
grand
jury
was
convened
in
the
summer
of
1974,
and
respondent
was
indicted
in
january
of
1975.
respondent
filed
several
pretrial
motions
in
1975
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
including
motions
to
dismiss
on
speedy
trial
and
double
jeopardy
grounds.
when
the
district
court
denied
these
motions,
respondent
took
a
pretrial
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit,
which
ordered
the
indictment
dismissed
on
speedy
trial
grounds.
in
1978,
this
court
vacated
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
on
the
ground
that
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
speedy
trial
grounds
could
not
be
appealed
before
a
trial.
on
remand,
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
respondent's
double
jeopardy
claim,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
the
case
was
then
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
trial.
after
the
district
court
denied
a
pretrial
speedy
trial
motion,
and
the
court
of
appeals
denied
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus,
respondent's
trial
commenced
in
july
of
1979,
and
he
was
found
guilty
on
three
counts
of
murder.
he
again
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
speedy
trial
grounds
after
the
trial,
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court,
and
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
respondent
had
been
denied
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
and
that
the
indictment
should
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
he
is
free
on
bail
and
working
in
california
as
a
physician.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
working
as
a
physician
in
california.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--at
one
time,
yes,
but
in
light
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
i
believe
the
district
court
changed
the
bail
conditions
and
allowed
him
out
on
bail.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
judge
dupree
wrote
an
opinion
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
i
believe
it
is
pages
56
to
63
that
are
relevant,
and
he
found
that
he
had
been
carefully
watching
during
the
trial
for
any
signs
of
prejudice,
and
that
there
was
no
prejudice
at
all
as
a
result
of
the
delay.
i
should
note
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
found
that
the
primary
part
of
the
delay
that
it
considered
ground
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
the
two-year
period
between
the
submission
of
the
cid
report
to
the
justice
department
and
the
convening
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
the
critical
period
here
for
this
court's
attention
is
the
period
between
the
dismissal
of
the
military
charges
in
october,
1970,
and
the
return
of
the
indictment
in
january
of
1975.
that
is
the
period
over
which
the
parties
are
in
dispute.
respondent's
contention
is
that
his
speedy
trial
right
attached
during
this
period,
one
during
which
no
charges
were
pending
against
him.
that
conclusion,
we
submit,
is
at
odds
both
with
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
with
the
policies
underlying
the
speedy
trial
clause.
the
sixth
amendment
provides,
"in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
"
and
it
then
goes
on
to
enumerate
several
other
protections
that
an
accused
is
entitled
to
in
the
course
of
criminal
prosecutions.
now,
during
the
period
after
dismissal
of
the
military
charges,
respondent
was
not
the
subject
of
the
criminal
prosecution,
nor
was
he
the
subject
of
a
public
accusation,
and
hence
could
be
called
an
accused
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
thus,
by
the
express
terms
of
the
constitutional
provision,
he
had
no
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
indeed,
the
right
makes
no
sense
in
this
context,
because
the
government
cannot
reasonably
be
required
to
speedily
try
a
person
on
charges
that
do
not
even
exist.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
i
mentioned
before
the
break,
we
believe
that
the
speedy
trial
clause
is
not
applicable
to
this
period
by
its
express
terms,
because
respondent
was
not
accused
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
this
is
quite
clear
from
this
court's
decision
in
marion,
where
the
court
specifically
focused
on
the
question
of
when
a
person
becomes
an
accused
such
that
a
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
right
attaches.
the
court
explained
at
page
320
of
its
opinion
in
marion,
and
i
quote,
"it
is
either
a
formal
indictment
or
information
or
else
the
actual
restraints
imposed
by
arrest
and
holding
to
answer
a
criminal
charge
that
engaged
this
protection.
"
here,
the
government
agrees
that
respondent's
sixth
amendment
right
did
attach
when
he
was
held
to
answer
a
criminal
charge
filed
under
article
30
of
the
code
of
military
justice,
but
the
government's
constitutional
obligation
was
completely
satisfied,
and
the
pendency
of
this
speedy
trial
right
was
necessary
extinguished
by
the
speedy
dismissal
of
that
charge
and
respondent's
release
from
all
restraints
on
his
liberty.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
government
was
freed
of
its
obligation
under
the
speedy
trial
clause,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
was
freed
of
its
obligation
to
try
to
bring
the
perpetrators
of
this
crime
to
justice,
so
they
continued
to
investigate
the
crime.
they
felt
that
they
had
enough
evidence
that
they
were
still
under
an
obligation
to
try
to
prosecute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
certainly
they
were
considering
prosecution.
as
long
as
there
was
an
unsolved
crime,
they
were
considering
prosecution.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
we
have
explained
in
our
reply
brief
that,
first
of
all,
the
one
witness
really
didn't
change
his
testimony,
and
explained
why
his
medical
opinion
had
changed;
the
second
witness
explained
why
she
could
not
recall
what
she
had
been
asked
about
when
she
was
first
interviewed,
and
then
later
did
recall
in
1975.
neither
one
of
these
has
anything
to
do
with
delay.
first
of
all,
the
speedy
trial
clause
really
doesn't
protect
the
defendant
against
the
strengthening
of
the
government's
case.
what
it
protects
him
against
is
prejudice
to
his
defense
because
of
the
passage
of
time.
when
the
charges
against
respondent
were
dismissed,
the
criminal
prosecution
was
terminated,
and
there
was
no
charge
left
to
which
a
speedy
trial
claim
could
attach.
now,
respondent
argues
that
his
case
is
markedly
similar
to
that
of
klopfer
versus
north
carolina,
and
i
think
it
is
instructive
to
address
this
contention,
because
in
our
view
it
is
the
differences
between
this
case,
the
situation
of
a
defendant
against
whom
no
charges
are
pending,
and
the
situation
of
the
defendant
in
klopfer
that
are
significant
for
sixth
amendment
purposes.
under
the
state
procedure
used
in
klopfer,
the
defendant
was
subjected
to
an
unliquidated
criminal
charge
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
the
state
simply
took
a
pause
in
its
prosecution
of
the
defendant,
a
pause
that
could
have
lasted
indefinitely,
and
it
was
free
to
pick
up
the
prosecution
again
at
any
time
right
where
it
left
off,
simply
by
calling
the
case
for
trial.
moreover,
the
statute
of
limitations
was
tolled
during
this
period,
and
thus
it
was
effectively
eliminated
as
a
protection
for
the
defendant.
here,
by
contrast,
the
government
could
try
respondent
only
by
beginning
a
prosecution
from
scratch
that
is,
by
convening
a
grand
jury,
convincing
the
grand
jury
to
return
an
indictment,
and
all
of
this
would
have
to
be
done
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
indeed,
the
court's
opinion
in
klopfer
indicates
that
a
speedy
dismissal
of
the
charges
against
an
accused
satisfies
the
sixth
amendment
right
just
as
surely
as
if
he
is
given
a
speedy
trial.
the
court
there
noted
at
page
216
of
its
opinion,
in
discussing
the
north
carolina
procedure,
that
the
procedure
provided
no
means
for
the
defendant
to
obtain
either
a
dismissal
or
a
trial.
now,
the
policies
underlying
the
speedy
trial
protection
similarly
have
no
applicability
to
a
period
when
no
charges
are
pending.
in
marion--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
in
our
view,
the
first
question
is
whether
the
speedy
trial
clause
is
applicable.
if
the
speedy
trial
clause
is
applicable
to
a
period,
then
you
look
at
the
barker
v.
ringo
factors,
and
one
of
those
factors
is
prejudice.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
he
would
still
have
his
fifth
amendment
argument.
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
in
marion,
this
court
discussed
the
policies
that
are
the
subject
of
a
sixth
amendment
protection.
a
formal
charge
brought
by
the
state
is
a
public
accusation
that
the
government
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
accused
has
committed
a
crime.
this
public
accusation
entails
certain
adverse
consequences
to
the
accused,
and
i
would
like
to
examine
those
adverse
consequences
as
listed
by
this
court
at
page
320
of
its
opinion
in
marion,
and
that
is
reprinted
in
our
brief
at
page
20.
in
our
view,
it
is
clear
that
these
consequences
are
dispelled
by
the
dismissal
of
the
charge,
just
as
surely
as
they
would
be
dispelled
if
the
accused
had
been
brought
to
a
speedy
trial
on
those
charges.
hence
a
dismissal
must
terminate
the
applicability
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee.
the
first
interest
identified
by
the
court
is
that
the
public
accusation
seriously
interferes
with
the
defendant's
liberty.
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
interest
protected,
because
it
is
the
one
that
is
unique
to
the
speedy
trial
context.
once
a
charge
is
brought,
the
defendant
is
under
some
restriction
on
his
liberty.
even
if
he
is
not
incarcerated,
he
would
probably
be
released
under
certain
conditions
of
bail.
of
course,
in
this
case,
this
interest
is
not
applicable
at
all,
because
defendant
was
completely
released
when
the
military
charges
were
dismissed
against
him
and
he
was
honorably
discharged
from
the
army.
he
had
no
restrictions
whatsoever
on
his
liberty.
another
interest
identified
by
this
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
record
shows
that
at
some
point
he
became
aware
of
the
ongoing
investigation.
i
don't
know
at
the
exact
time
that
he
was
discharged
if
he
was,
but
certainly
during
this
period
he
was
aware
of
the
investigation.
of
course,
that
is
always...
that
is
going
to
be
true
in
many
cases
of
pre-indictment
delay,
and
in
marion
this
court
explicitly
said
that
the
fact
that
an
accused...
that
a
person
may
have
some
anxiety
over
a
criminal
investigation
against
him
does
not
mean
that
his
speedy
trial
right--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
true.
the
public
obloquy
to
which
he
was
subjected,
we
submit,
was
dispelled
by
the
equally
public
exoneration
that
he
received,
that
is,
the
dismissal
of
the
charges
and
his
honorable
discharge.
this
put
him
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
been
tried
and
acquitted.
indeed,
he
was...
for
purposes
of
the
public
obloquy
interest,
he
was
in
a
better
position
because
there
had
not
even
been
a
finding
of
probable
cause
against
him,
whereas
had
he
been
acquitted,
the
public
could
reasonably
presume
that
there
had
been
probable
cause
to
charge
him
with
the
crime.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right,
but
that
is
only
because
he
would
have
been
put
in
jeopardy,
and
he
could
have
been...
another
prosecution
couldn't
have
been
brought
against
him,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
separate
the
interests
that
we
are
talking
about.
the
speedy
trial
clause
doesn't
give
him
the
right
to
jeopardy,
to
double
jeopardy.
obviously,
he
would
have
preferred
to
be
acquitted,
but
as
far
as
these
specific
interests
that
the
court
has
identified
in
connection
with
the
speedy
trial
clause,
i
don't
think
the
public
obloquy
to
which
he
was
subjected
after
his
dismissal
was
any
worse
than
if
he
had
been
acquitted.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
the
rule
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
protect
against
a
second
prosecution
brought
by
the
federal
government
after
by
the
state.
now,
in
this
situation
it
is
considered
to
be
a
single
sovereign,
so
if
he
had
in
fact
been
tried
by
the
military--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
as
to
the
factual
matter
of
anxiety,
i
think
the
only
thing
that
is
fair
to
say
is
that
he
is
in
the
same
position
as
a
person
who
has
been...
excuse
me,
as
a
person
who
is
under
investigation,
and
knows
that
he
is
under
investigation.
now,
that
creates--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
or
someone
who
has
been
indicted
by
the
state.
now--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--there
is,
of
course,
an
additional
anxiety
once
he
is
subject
to
a
pending
indictment.
that
is
the
anxiety
that
the
speedy
trial
clause
protects
against,
and
that
is
the
anxiety
that
has
been
dispelled
by
his
public,
by
the
dismissal
of
the
charges.
the
lingering
anxiety
that
he
still
has
over
the
possibility
that
he
may
still
be
prosecuted
is
no
different
than
what
the
defendant
in
marion
had.
i
think
just
as
the
policies
underlying
the
speedy
trial
clause
militate
against
respondent's
position,
so,
too,
do
considerations
of
the
sound
administration
of
justice.
as
this
court
explained
in
lovasco,
there
are
important
reasons
for
permitting
the
prosecutor
to
exercise
his
discretion
as
to
whether
and
when
to
institute
criminal
charges.
these
considerations
are
equally
applicable
if
the
charge
has
already
been
filed
and
dismissed,
and
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
there
are
many
legitimate
reasons
for
a
prosecutor
deciding
to
dismiss
a
charge
that
has
already
been
filed.
now,
the
filing
of
a
criminal
charge
against
a
defendant,
particularly
for
murder,
is
a
decision
not
to
be
made
lightly
or
hastily.
as
this
court
stated
in
lovasco,
the
fact
that
a
prosecutor
takes
a
long
time
and
carefully
considers
whether
to
bring
such
a
charge
is
an
exercise
of
principles
of
fair
play
and
decency,
not
in
opposition
to
those
principles.
the
administration
of
justice
is
advanced
if
a
prosecutor
is
free
to
exercise
his
discretion
without
the
threat
of
the
severe
sanction
of
dismissal
of
the
indictment
for
all
time
hanging
over
his
head
if
he
does
not
act
with
what
a
court
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
later
determines
to
be
sufficient
expedition.
now,
the
respondent
has
suggested
in
this
case,
at
page
19
of
his
brief,
that
he
does
not
necessarily
insist
that
there
be
a
general
rule
applying
the
speedy
trial
clause
to
a
period
after
dismissal,
but
he
does
contend
that
the
protection
should
apply
to
this
period
in
his
special
case.
he
does
not
really
explain
what
factors
justify
a
special
exception
for
him,
and
indeed,
we
contend
that
whatever
special
aspects
there
are
to
this
case
argue
even
more
forcefully
against
applying
the
speedy
trial
clause
here.
first,
the
charges
were
brought
by
a
different
prosecuting
authority,
by
the
military,
so
there
is
not
the
same
specter
of
the
same
prosecutor
making
a
mistake,
bringing
charges,
and
then
dismissing
them.
second,
he
was
never
indicted
at
all.
and
third,
and
perhaps
most
important
is
the
extraordinary
severity
of
the
crime
involved
here,
which
should
argue
against
a
special
exception
for
speedy
trial
purposes.
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
however,
that
it
is
important
that
there
be
a
general
rule
on
which
prosecutors
can
rely
in
this
area.
prosecutors
are
entitled
to
know
when
making
the
charging
decision
whether
the
speedy
trial
time
is
running
against
them.
they
should
not
have
to
be
exposed
to
the
possibility
that
a
court
will
later
decide
that
a
particular
case
calls
for
an
exception,
and
a
sort
of
retrospective
application
of
the
speedy
trial
clause
to
a
period
where
the
prosecutor
would
not
have
expected
the
time
to
be
running.
this
general
rule,
we
suggest,
is
a
simple
one.
it
is
the
one
that
was
stated
by
this
court
at
page
313
of
its
opinion
in
marion.
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
a
person
who
is
subject
to
a
public
accusation
the
right
to
a
speedy
disposition
of
the
charges
pending
against
him,
no
more.
now,
this
case
has
a
narrow
focus,
and
that
is
the
applicability
of
the
speedy
trial
clause.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
a
person
has
legitimate
interests
concerning
the
possibility
of
prosecution
even
when
no
charges
are
pending
against
him.
but
our
system
of
justice
provides
other
protections
for
those
interests,
not
the
speedy
trial
clause.
for
example,
a
person
has
an
interest
in
repose
against
the
possibility
that
charges
will
eventually
be
brought
against
him,
or
that
stale
charges
will
be
brought.
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
is
the
protection
for
that
interest.
he
also
is
entitled
to
protection
against
unfair
pre-indictment
delay
or
government
misconduct,
but
the
due
process
clause
protects
him
against
that.
and,
of
course,
he
is
entitled
to
protection
against
a
second
prosecution
once
a
first
prosecution
has
advanced
to
a
certain
stage,
but
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
the
source
of
that
protection.
these
protections
are
adequate
to
serve
their
purposes,
and
there
is
no
need
to
supplement
them
here
by
wrenching
the
sixth
amendment
from
its
proper
context
to
apply
to
a
situation
when
no
charges
are
pending
against
the
accused.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly,
if
i
could,
to
the
subsidiary
questions
that
are
raised
by
this
case.
on
respondent's
contention
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
dismissal
under
the
fifth
amendment,
we
think
this
contention
is
insubstantial.
there
is
clearly,
by
respondent's
own
admission
in
this
case,
no
intentional
or
unfair
government
delay
in
this
case,
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
fifth
amendment
violation.
moreover,
as
discussed
in
our
brief,
there
was
no
actual
prejudice
to
the
accused's
defense
at
trial.
with
respect
to
the
sixth
amendment
question,
which
this
court
need
reach
only
if
it
rejects
the
government's
primary
contention
that
the
speedy
trial
clause
does
not
apply
to
this
period,
we
suggest
that
the
delay
between
the
dismissal
of
the
charges
and
the
return
of
the
indictment
was
justifiable,
and
should
not
be
held
against
the
government.
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
was
an
extraordinarily
complex
case
that
required
detailed
analysis
of
the
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
that
there
was
no
undue
delay
in
the
preparation
and
submission
of
the
cid
report
up
until
1972,
and
it
took
the
justice
department
time
to
digest
the
material
in
this
report
and
to
decide
whether
a
case
could
be
made
against
the
respondent.
moreover,
a
murder
charge
is
a
very
serious
matter,
and
it
was
the
government's
position,
as
it
should
be,
that
it
did
not
want
to
charge
the
respondent
with
the
murders
unless
it
felt
it
could
obtain
a
conviction.
there
were
certain...
there
were
obviously
certain
factors
which
respondent
has
pointed
to
in
his
brief
that
made
it
at
least
questionable
whether
a
conviction
could
be
obtained
in
this
case.
they
had
to
worry
about
the
decision
made
by
the
article
32
hearing
already,
which
had
held
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
convene
a
court
martial,
an
the
fact
that
the
case
was
essentially
circumstantial,
and
that
there
was
no
obvious
motive.
finally,
i
should
point
out
that,
contrary
to
respondent's
suggestion,
this
careful
consideration
and
time
that
the
department
gave
to
the
case
was
not
in...
excuse
me,
was
not
in
opposition
to
the
desires
that
they
expressed
for
a
prompt
resolution
of
the
case.
now,
there
are
letters
that
respondent's
counsel
sent
to
the
department
of
justice
asking
about
the
case
asking
about
its
status,
asking
that
it
be
dismissed
because
of
his
innocence,
and
wondering
what
was
happening.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
during
the
period--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
am
sorry.
that
the
investigation
be
terminated,
and
that
the
department
abandon
its
efforts
to
establish
a
case
against
him.
now,
respondent's
counsel
did
not
ask
that
the
government
go
forward
promptly
and
indict
him.
rather,
they
asked
that
it
give
careful
consideration
to
all
the
factors
before
deciding
to
proceed
with
an
indictment,
and
unfortunately,
these
letters
were
in
the
record.
they
are
not
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
appeal.
they
were
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
court
in
macdonald
one,
and
i
would
like
to
read
one
portion
from
page
94
of
that
joint
appendix.
this
was
written
by
mr.
malley,
respondent's
counsel,
to
mr.
snead,
the
deputy
attorney
general,
and
he
asks
the
department,
"it
at
all
possible
to
take
whatever
steps
you
feel
appropriate
to
ensure
that
dr.
macdonald's
case
is
carefully
evaluated.
"
this
letter
was
written
in
april
of
1973,
which
was
already
into
the
time
period
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
the
government
should
already
have
indicted
him.
the
court
of
appeals'
suggestion
essentially
is
that
as
soon
as
the
government
got
this
report,
it
should
have
run
in,
convened
a
grand
jury,
and
indicted
him,
but
here
you
have,
in
the
middle
of
this
period,
respondent
is
still
asking
for
careful
consideration
by
the
government
before
reaching
such
a
decision.
another
factor
in
the
barker
analysis
is
the
prejudice.
i
think
the
prejudice
to
the
defense
is
adequately
discussed
in
the
briefs.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
support
in
the
record
for
respondent's
assertion
that
publicity
and
expense
to
which
he
was
subjected
continued
unabated.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
step
back
and
consider
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here.
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
brutal
crime,
the
murder
of
his
wife
and
two
children,
after
what
this
court
must
assume
to
have
been
a
fair
trial.
nevertheless,
he
has
been
set
free
forever,
never
to
answer
for
that
crime.
this
has
been
done
because
the
government
took
great
care
and
time
to
consider
his
case
before
deciding
to
charge
him,
and
an
appellate
court
has
determined
with
hindsight
that
the
decision
could
have
been
reached
in
less
time.
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
require
such
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
the
respondent
has
raised
it,
and
i
think
it
is
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
so.
the
respondent...
i
mean,
there
is
the
matter
of
prejudice,
but
the
respondent
has
never
tried
to
put
any
evidence
in.
there
have
been...
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
claims,
there
have
been
whatever
evidence
there
would
be
on
prejudice.
he
says
that
the
record
is
adequate
to
decide
it,
and
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
justice
harlan
was
resistant
to
the
idea
of
incorporating
the
bill
of
rights
into
a...
to
apply
to
the
states,
so
he
wanted
to
decide
the
case
on
due
process
grounds,
but
it
was
decided
on
sixth
amendment
grounds.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
respondent
has
raised
the
sixth
amendment
issue
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
i
think
that
issue
is
before
the
court.
it
wasn't
decided
below,
and
the
court
could
remand,
but
i
am
not
sure
it
would
serve
any
purpose
to
remand
it.
we
thin
it
is
a
pretty
straightforward--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
the
actual
sixth...
application
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
these
facts
would
no
longer
be
before
this
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
oh,
yes.
on
remand,
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
think
it
serves
any
purpose
to
really
discuss
here
whether
helena
stokley
committed
these
murders
or
not.
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing,
though.
this
contention
was
never
raised
in
the
district
court
at
all,
or
on
the
first
appeal.
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
in
1979,
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
not
quite
the
obvious
prejudice
that
the
respondent
suggests.
in
fact,
i
think,
as
we
pointed
out
adequately
in
our
brief,
and
as
the
dissenters
in
the
court
of
appeals
suggest,
there
was
absolutely
no
prejudice
at
all
in
this
regard.
she
testified
shortly
after
the
crime,
she
stated,
rather,
shortly
after
the
crimes
that
she
didn't
remember
where
she
was
because
of
drugs,
the
same
thing
that
she
said
at
the
trial.
there
is
just
no
support
in
the
record
for
any
finding
of
prejudice
to
the
defense.
second,
there
is
also
no
support
in
the
record
for
finding
that
the
justice
department
was
indifferent
during
this
period
when
it
was
deciding
whether
to
prosecute.
in
fact,
the
record
indicates
that
the
case
was
always
under
active
consideration
by
the
department.
of
course,
nothing
happened
in
the
sense
that
an
indictment
wasn't
brought
until
it
was
decided,
but
that
is
because
there
was
an
internal
dispute
in
the
department
as
to
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
get
a
conviction,
and
the
department
took
its
time
in
deciding
that...
until
it
decided
that
it
finally
could
get
a
conviction
and
to
bring
the
charges.
in
response
to
what
mr.
justice
brennan
said
before,
there
are
grounds
for
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
if
this
court
decides
the
due
process
question
there
are
no
grounds
on
which
the
indictment
could
be
dismissed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
grounds
on
which
a
new
trial
could
be
ordered.
with
respect
to...
getting
back
to
the
sixth
amendment
question,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
the
prosecution
does
not
avoid
the
speedy
trial
guarantee
by
the
expedient
of
dismissing
the
indictment
and
then
reindicting.
the
period
during
which
the
indictment
is
pending
is
always
countered
with
the
speedy
trial
guarantee,
so
you
can't
just
dismiss
the
indictment
and
then
go
in
the
next
day
and
get
a
new
indictment,
and
evade
the
speedy
trial
clause
that
way.
i
suggest
the
prosecutors
have
better
things
to
do
than
to
go
out
and
get
indictments
and
then
dismiss
them
and
then
wait
ten
years
and
get
another
indictment.
that
just
doesn't
happen
unless
there
is
a
good
reason
for
it.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
again
to
this
letter
from
mr.
malley
with
respect
to
respondent's
contention
that
the
adverse
effects
of
the
charge
were
continued
unabated
during
this
period
when
no
charges
were
pending
against
him.
in
this
letter,
as
i
pointed
out,
he
asked
the
government
to
consider,
carefully
consider
before
bringing
an
indictment
against
him,
and
he
points
out
that
during
the
period
since
the
military
proceedings
ended
he
has
been
getting
his
life
back
together,
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"some
of
the
things
you
must
consider
is
any
sort
of
formal
attempt
to
accuse
him
again
will
result
in
devastating
publicity,
enormous
financial
loss,
and
personal
humiliation
to
him.
"
thus,
respondent
himself
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
period
when
no
charges
are
pending,
after
they
have
been
dismissed,
and
a
period
when
a
formal
charge
is
pending.
this
is
at
pages
101
to
102
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
dissenters
on
rehearing
addressed
the
prejudice
issue,
so
there
it
was--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
district
judge
found
no
prejudice,
so
that
makes
it
six
to
five,
i
guess,
in
favor
of
no
prejudice.
i
think
the
dissenters'
opinion
is
quite
adequate
in
this
regard.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
the
other
ones,
we
don't
know
what
they
did.
they
just
didn't
vote
for
a
hearing.
thank
you.
