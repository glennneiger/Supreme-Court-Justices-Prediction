mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
general
questions
presented
are:
whether
the
congress,
in
passing
section
1014
of
title
xviii
of
the
united
states
code
intended
to
proscribe
the
deposit
of
a
bad
check
or
1014.
in
this
case
there
were
three
counts
of
an
indictment
and
mr.
williams,
the
petitioner,
was
convicted
on
all
three
counts.
the
first
count
was
a
misapplication
count
and
really
is
only
indirectly
in
issue
in
this
case.
the
other
two
counts
both
involved
an
allegation
of
the
overvaluation
of
a
security,
that
is
a
check,
in
order
to
influence
the
action
of
a
federally...
excuse
me...
insured
bank
on
an
advance
or
extension
of
credit.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
two
counts.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
yes,
sir.
now,
in
this
case
the
court
has
limited
the
consideration
on
certiorari
to
two
counts,
counts
two
and
three.
but
i
think
it's
significant
that
we
consider
what
counts
two
and
three
were.
count
two
was
the
overvaluation
of
58,500
which
was
deposited,
drawn
on
the
winn
state
bank
and
deposited
in
the
pelican
state
bank.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
at
a
time
when
there
were
insufficient
funds
to
support
it,
yes,
sir.
and
the
government--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--yes,
sir.
it
was
a
check
that
did
not
have
funds
to
support
it,
yes,
sir.
now,
that
check
did
clear
the
bank
in
the
normal
course
of
things.
it
was
not
dishonored;
it
was
paid,
and
it
never
came
back.
the
other
check
was
a
$60,000
check
drawn
on
the
pelican
state
bank,
which
was
deposited
in
the
winn
state
bank,
and
that
covered
the
first
check.
that
check
too
was
paid
by
the
bank
and
was
not
returned
for
insufficient
funds,
although
at
the
time
it
was
deposited
there
were
not
funds
in
the
bank
sufficient
to
cover
it.
now,
the
pelican
state
bank,
which
was
where
it
all
started,
had
the
choice
in
that
instance
of
bouncing
the
check
or
extending
credit
on
the
check,
which
resulted
in
an
overdraft.
it
chose
to
extend
credit
and
have
an
overdraft.
now,
when
this
transaction
started
williams
had
an
overdraft
at
the
pelican
state
bank.
now,
we
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
started
off
with
an
overdraft
at
the
pelican
state
bank
on
may
the
9th
of
something
over
$58,000.
the
whole
transaction
ended
on
may
the
11th,
two
days
later,
with
an
overdraft
at
the
pelican
state
bank
of
something
less
than
$60,000.
no
check
was
dishonored.
no
check
was
bounced.
and
it
was
two
separate
checks.
now,
we
mention
that
because
we
raised
this
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
under
section
1014.
the
court
of
appeals
summarily
dismissed
that
by
saying
that
the
argument
was
without
merit,
because
the
two
transactions
at
the
two
banks
constitute
classical
check
kiting,
and
under
payne,
which
was
a
fifth
circuit
case,
this
check
kiting
falls
within
the
scope
of
section
1014.
now,
that's
significant
because
they
used
both
counts
of
the
indictment
to
create
the
concept
of
check
kiting.
and
as
we
know
and
as
this
court
has
held,
you
cannot
do
that.
each
count
must
stand
on
its
own
and
you
cannot
say
that
if
both
counts
constitute
an
offense
then
one
can
be
used
in
the
other
count
unless
it's
incorporated
therein
by
reference.
in
this
case
it
wasn't
done.
now,
the
argument
in
this
case
ought
to
be
simple,
then.
in
its
simplest
terms,
no
crime
was
alleged
in
the
indictment
under
counts
two
and
three
and
no
crime
was
proved
within
section
1014.
however,
the
case
has
become
complicated.
it's
become
complicated
because
the
government
contends
that
a
check
is
a
security,
a
security
under
section
1014.
now,
i
remind
the
court
of
the
language
of
section
1014.
it
says:
"whoever
makes
a
false
statement
or
report,
or
whoever
overvalues
land,
property
or
security
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
a
federally
insured
bank
to
extend
credit
or
make
advances.
"
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
it
uses
the
word
"security",
not
"a
security".
but
in
this
case
the
government
claims
that
a
check
is
a
security
and
therefore
this
constituted
the
overvaluation
of
a
security.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
a
check
could
be
property,
but
not
in
the
sense
of
this
code
section.
a
check
could
be
property.
but
this
says
"land,
property
or
other
security.
"
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
a
check
could
be
property.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
and
the
government
makes
that
argument.
but
not
in
the
context
of
that,
and
i'll
get
further
into
that.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
it
says
"land,
property
or
security".
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
stocks
or
bonds
would
be
covered
if
they
are
pledged
as
security.
but
they're
talking
about
security
in
the
sense
of
collateral,
and
this
was
not
that.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
yes,
sir.
and
security
in
th
sense
of
collateral.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
yes,
sir.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
oh,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
i
think
that
it's
security
in
the
sense
of
collateral.
i
think
you
may
apply
the
doctrine
of
eiusdem
generis
and
say
that
it
relates
back
to
the
type
of
security
that
land
or
property
is.
but
i
really
say
that
it
talks
about
security
in
the
sense
of
collateral,
not
a
security
in
the
sense
of
a
stock
or
a
bond
used
for
something
other
than
collateral.
the
government's
position
is--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--yes,
sir.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct,
sir.
that
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir,
because
there're
are
two
elements
of
it.
one
of
it
says
"whoever
shall
knowingly
makes
a
false
report
or
statement.
"
"a
false
statement
or
report".
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
now,
that's
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
but
it's
about
if
you
overvalued
security
in
that
sense,
that's
correct,
it's
not
about
collateral.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
i
think
you
could
read
it
that
way,
sir.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
i
don't
know
whether
you
could
or
not.
you
could
read
it
the
way
it's
written,
i
guess.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
it
is
property,
yes,
sir.
but
it
was
not
used...
it
says
"for
the
purpose
of
extending"...
"of
an
extension
of
credit
or
an
advance
or
a
loan.
"
it's
talking
in
terms
of
commercial
and
consumer
credit.
it's
not
talking
about
the
presentation
of
a
check
to
a
bank
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
bank
collect
it
or
whatever
purpose
the
bank
used
it
for.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
but
you
have
two
things
that
occur.
one
is
the
crediting
your
account
is
not
an
extension
of
credit.
that's
been
held
by
one
of
the
circuits,
the
crown
case
which
was
recently
decided.
it's
not
an
extension
of
credit.
but
if
you
say
that
they
draw
on
that,
that
that
constitutes
a
commercial
loan
transaction,
then
that's
one
thing.
but
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
doesn't,
and
in
order
to
reach
that
result
in
this
case
it
requires
such
convoluted
reasoning
that
it
does
not
give
a
person
any
warning
that
under
this
statute
they
are
violating
a
criminal
law.
and
we
say
that...
now,
we
didn't
raise
the
constitutional
question
of
impermissible
vagueness,
but
that's
what
the
principle
is
about.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
one
of
the...
you
ask
about
the
legislative
history.
let
me
address
that
question
by
stating
this.
this
statute
up
until
1970
did
not
include
any
institution
that
could
accept
checks
from
private
customers
for
deposit.
in
1970
the
congress
merely
passed
a
law
adding
certain
federally
insured
banks
and
federal
savings
an
loan
institutions.
there
was
nothing
that
did
anything
but
that.
that's
all
they
did.
now,
at
the
same
time
this
congress
amended
a
bad
check
law
in
the
district
of
columbia.
that
bad
check
law
covers
the
conduct
that
the
government
says
ought
to
be
covered
here.
in
that
law
they
use
the
words
"check,
draft
or
other
instrument.
"
used
at
a
bank,
or
that
sort
of
thing.
they
made
it
clear
what
they
were
talking
about.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
include
a
check
or
a
draft
under
this
statute,
all
they
had
to
do
was
what
they
did
when
they
amended
the
district
of
columbia
act.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
a
check--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--a
check
is
property,
but
not
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
oh,
no,
sir.
i
say
a
check
is
property.
a
check
can
even
be
security,
because
if
i
tender
to
a
bank
several
checks
and
say,
hold
this
for
a
loan,
when
i
get
an
extension,
when
i
borrow
money
from
the
bank,
it
can
be
security.
but
in
the
terms
of
this
statute
and
this
situation,
it
is
not.
and
the
statute
was
never
intended
to
include
that.
if
they
did,
why
did
they
say
"land,
property
or
security"?
why
didn't
they
say
what
they
said
in
the
same
year,
1970,
when
they
passed
the
last
amendment
to
this
act,
when
they
added
banks
and
federal
savings
and
loan
institutions?
why
didn't
they
say
"check"
instead
of
"land,
property
or
security"?
we
think
that's
part
of
the
legislative
intent.
in
addition
to
that,
we
cite
in
our
brief
several
situations
where
we
quote
from
the
house
banking
and
currency
committee
when
they
say
it's
intended
to
cover
a
borrower.
we
quote
from
the
senate
banking
and
currency
committee,
which
talks
about
the
1970
amendment
and
says
it
simply
adds
institutions
that
are
covered
under
the
act.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
what
i've
got
is
a
normal--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--oh,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
i
would.
but
that
happens--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--well,
not
under
the
terms
of
this
statute.
let
me
explain
it
this
way,
because
i
don't
want
to
dodge
the
question.
under
louisiana
law,
when
you
present
a
check
to
a
bank
for
deposit
you
engage
that
you
will,
upon
notice
of
dishonor,
make
that
check
good.
that's
what
you
engage.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
it's
in
the
form
of
a
note,
yes,
sir.
it's
in
the
form
of
a
note.
and
what
you
do,
you
engage
that,
and
that's
the
only
representation
you
make,
unless
you
orally
or
in
writing
make
some
other
representation.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
right.
you
are
getting
it
on
an
uncollected
check.
you
promise
to
pay
only
if
the
check
is
dishonored
and
the
bank
protests
and
gives
you
notice
of
dishonor.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
yes,
sir,
because
in
that
instance
it
is
a
commercial
transaction
where
you
are
borrowing
money.
in
the
other
instance
you
are
merely
depositing
a
check
and
they
are
giving
you
immediate
credit,
which
is
a
unilateral
decision
on
the
bank.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
it
was
interest-free.
this
was
an
overdraft.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
yes,
sir.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
if
he
gives
them
a
check
on
a
nonexistent
bank
where
the
signature
is--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
he
has.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
not
this
statute,
no,
sir.
whether
he
has
violated
all
50
states'
bad
check
laws,
which
is
another
thing
that's
involved
in
the
history
and
rule
of
lenity,
and
that
is
that
all
50
states
in
1970
had
bad
check
laws
that
covered
that
conduct
and
this
has
historically
and
traditionally
been
the
subject
of
state
regulation.
and
if
congress
had
intended
to
make
such
broad
inroads
and
intrusions
into
state
law,
then
certainly
it
should
have
said
something
to
let
people
know
that
that's
what
it
was
doing.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
it
does
not
require
that.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
it
is
broad,
and
it
says
"to
influence
the
extension
of
credit
or
advance.
"
or
forebearance
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
it
does
not
have
to
actually
influence
as
long
as
it
was
intended
to
influence.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir,
because
they're
talking
about
extensions
of
credit,
advances,
loans,
commitments,
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
your
reasoning
is
good
up
to
the
point
where
the
interpretation
of
the
word
"commitment"
is
used
to
commit
to
open
a
bank
account.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
it's
an
agreement
to
make
a
loan
or
to
extend
credit
in
a
commercial,
consumer
type
setting.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
i
know
it
is.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
the...
i
don't
know
what
"or
otherwise"
means.
the
only
time
it
has
been
interpreted
was
in
the
pinto
case,
and
in
that
case
what
they
did
there...
i
believe
it
was
the
pinto
case...
where
the
man
had
gotten
an
erroneous
credit
of
$193,000
when
it
was
supposed
to
be
$193.
and
after
it
was
all
found
out
that
he
had
gotten
the
erroneous
credit,
he
lied
to
the
bank.
he
told
an
intentional
falsehood
in
order
to
get
them
to
defer
action
or
otherwise.
and
they
used
it
in
the
sense
of
defining
deferring
action.
and
i
don't
know
what
it
means
other
than
that.
but
it
certainly
cannot
cover
a
bad
check.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so,
for
two
reasons:
number
one
is,
when
you
put
the
check
in
the
bank
you
are
not
making
a
statement
other
than
what
the
law
says
you're
making,
and
that
is
that
you
will
pay
the
check
in
the
event
it
is
dishonored
and
you
have
notice
of
dishonor.
all
right,
that's
number
one.
number
two,
it
is
not
security
for
anything.
it
is
not
security
for
anything.
now,
admittedly
under
louisiana
law
they
have
a
lien
on
an
uncollected
item
until
such
time
as
they
send
it
out
for
purposes
other
than
collection
or
until
such
time
as
it's
collected.
but
again,
if
you
have
to
take
the
uniform
commercial
code
or
if
you
have
to
take
the
louisiana
revised
statutes
and
compare
them
and
then
say
that
because
they
have
a
lien
at
some
time
for
some
period
on
uncollected
items,
then
that
fits
into
security
or
the
influencing
of
a
loan
in
this
case,
then
that's
too
convoluted
to
come
under
a
statute
which
talks
about
land,
property
or
security
for
the
extension
of
credit.
and
that's
one
of
the
points
we're
making.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
it's
influenced
them
to
issue
money
on
an
uncollected
item.
it
has
done
something.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir,
it's
not
a
violation.
it's
a
violation
of
a
state
statute,
and
if
they
can
prove
intent
to
defraud
it
may
even
come
under
other
statutes.
of
course,
you'd
have
to
use
the
wire
or
the
mails
to
do
that.
but
this
statute
is
sort
of
a
strict
liability
statute.
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
they
intended
to
defraud,
and
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
mere
giving
of
a
check
that
at
the
time
it's
presented
to
the
bank
does
not
have
sufficient
funds
to
cover
it
if
he's
given
immediate
credit
on
it
constitutes
a
violation.
i
submit
to
your
honors--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir.
he
says
"knowingly",
knowing
that
at
the
time
it's
presented
for
deposit
that
there
aren't
sufficient
funds
to
cover
it.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
doesn't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
to
cover
it
when
it's
presented,
and
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
i
submit
that
everybody
has
done
that,
deposited
a
check
in
the
bank
and
covered
it
the
next
day
at
the
receiving
bank,
the
drawee
bank.
but
that's
what
is
contended
to
be
a
crime,
and
you
don't
even
have
to
prove,
under
the
government's
contention,
that
there
was
an
intent
to
defraud,
because
this
statute
does
not
embrace
the
intent
to
defraud.
now,
the
deposit,
in
response
to
mr.
chief
justice's
question,
if
you
take
that
just
a
little
bit
further
and
you
make
that
a
certified
check
that
is
known
to
be
false,
then
i
think
you
could
have
a
violation
of
this
statute.
now,
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
if
i--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--no,
sir.
the
difference
is
what
the
legal
representation
is.
as
i
said
before,
when
you
have
a
check
uncertified
the
legal
representation
under
louisiana
law
is
that
you
will
honor
it
on
notice
of
dishonor.
okay.
now,
if
it's
a
check
drawn
on
a
bank
and
it's
certified,
then
the
representation
is
that
the
bank
has
the
funds
already
on
hand
to
cover
that
check
and
that
it
will
be
honored.
if
you--
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
--has
been
set
aside,
and
that's
the
representation
you
make
by
the
mere
presentation
of
the
check.
and
if
you
know
that
to
be
false,
then
you
have
made
a
false
representation.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
property,
land
or
security.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
well,
it
depends.
if
you
got
immediate
credit,
it
might
violate
the
other
portion
of
the
statute,
your
honors,
the
false
statement
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
extension
of
credit.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir.
there
are
two
separate
elements.
a
false
statement
or
report
has
to
do
with
one
element
to
influence.
the
other
is
the
overvaluation
of
land,
property
and
security.
now
that's
one
of
the
problems
here.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
you
see?
one
of
the
problems
here
is
they
didn't
charge
this
man
with
the
first
element,
that
is
making
a
false
statement
or
report.
they
charged
him
with
the
second
element
and
they
tried
to
fit
it
in
by
calling
it
a
security.
and
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
yes,
sir.
that's
two
separate
offenses.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir.
i
was
making
the
opposite
point.
the
distinguishing
factor
is
that
one
of
them
is
a
false
statement,
and
the
security
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
i
can
make
a
false
statement
just
by
telling
you
i'm
a
millionaire.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
it
would
be
a
false
statement.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
he
was
charged
with
overvaluing
"a
security,
that
is
a
check.
"
but
they
underpin
that
and
try
to
fit
it
into
the
false
statement
section
by
saying
that's
based
on
the
fact
that
he
misrepresented
or
caused
to
be
misrepresented
the
value
of
the
check
because
he...
because
he
represented
it
to
be
in
the
face
amount
of
the
check.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
it
was
honored.
the
funds
weren't
there,
but
the
bank
paid
it.
it
didn't
come
back
and
it
wasn't
bounced.
but
the
lower
court
put
the
two
counts
together
and
said,
this
is
check
kiting
and
since
payne
holds
that
check
kiting
comes
under
1014
then
that's
what
we've
got
here.
and
that's
a
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
what
this
charged.
that's
all
it
charged.
you've
got
to
combine
the
counts
to
make
it
charge
anything
else.
and
i
say
it's
a
very
dangerous
precedent.
people
do
that
every
day.
now,
the
state
check
laws
cover
that
if
it
is
an
intent
to
defraud,
and
that's
a
horse
of
a
different
color.
i'm
saving
some
time
for
rebuttal,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
can
make
just
two
quick
points.
one
of
them
has
to
do
with
what
this
indictment
is
all
about.
they
say
we
didn't
raise
the
issue
of
false
statement
until
we
got
up
here.
the
statute
is
couched
in
the
alternative.
it
says
either
a
false
statement
or
overvaluing
security.
now,
they
didn't...
if
you
look
at
the
indictment,
it
says
that
he
overvalued
security
in
that
he
presented
the
check
and
represented
it
was
of
a
value
in
its
face
amount.
they
did
not
make
a
specific
charge
of
making
a
false
statement.
they
used
that
to
underpin
the
charge
of
overvaluing
a
security.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
no,
sir,
this
is
the
first
time
we
realized
this,
when
we
got
cert.
to
this
court.
we
used
it
as
an
argument
because
it
underpins
the
overvaluing
of
a
security.
and
let
me
mention
one
other
thing.
this
case
was
tried
on
check
kiting.
that's
the
unfortunate
thing
about
this
case
and
that's
why
if
this
court
determines
that
in
this
case
the
court
was
in
error
and
it
should
be
reversed,
it
should
reverse
count
one,
too.
the
judge
charged
the
jury
that
the
defendant
was
being
charged
with
check
kiting.
the
two
witnesses...
the
fbi
agent
testified
it
was
check
kiting,
and
a
back
examiner
testified
it
was
check
kiting.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
that's
correct.
and
i
really
don't
know
what
check
kiting
is.
black's
gives
three
definitions
and
words
and
phrases
gives
two
other
that
are
broader.
and
let
me
tell
you
just
one
other
minute
about
it.
opposing
counsel
has
stated
that
this
wasn't
check
kiting.
in
the
joint
appendix,
we
show
the
government
charges
that
mr.
williams
was
involved
in
check
kiting,
and
that's
a
direct
quote.
let
me
give
one
other
example
about
what
justice
o'connor
mentioned.
let's
assume
that
a
person
has
two
banks
that
they
operate
out
of,
that
on
the
way
to
bank
a
to
deposit
a
check
they
stop
at
bank
b
and
deposit
a
check
on
bank
a.
they
have
the
check
in
their
pocket
to
deposit
in
bank
a.
they
then
go
to
bank
a
and
deposit
that
check,
but
until
they
deposited
that
bank
a
did
not
have
sufficient
funds
to
cover
the
check
at
bank
b.
that
is
a
violation
under
this
indictment
as
charged
in
this
case
of
the
law,
and
that's
all
it
takes...
no
intent
to
defraud,
as
long
as
that
bank
credits
their
account
with
that
check
instead
of
waiting
for
collection.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
even
if
they
don't
do
it.
that's
a...
now,
opposing
counsel
said
it
was
a
bank's
decision
to
use
overdrafts
to
wipe
out
that,
and
that's
true,
it
was
the
bank's
decision.
my
time's
up.
i
wanted
to
make
one
other
point.
mr.
nickolas
p.
chilivis
thank
you,
your
honors.
