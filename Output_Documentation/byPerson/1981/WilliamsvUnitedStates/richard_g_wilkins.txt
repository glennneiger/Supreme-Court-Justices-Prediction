mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
straightforward
question
of
statutory
construction.
that
question
is
whether
petitioner's
deceptive
check-writing
conduct
falls
within
the
reach
of
the
federal
statute
that
specifically
prescribes
the
making
of
intentional
misrepresentations
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
credit
decisions
of
a
federally
insured
bank.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
counts
two
and
three
of
the
indictment
charge
petitioner
with
knowingly
an
willfully
overvaluing
a
security.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
also
contains
representation
that
he
presented
the
checks
and
caused
to
be
represented
to
said
bank
that
said
check
was
of
a
value
equal
to
the
face
amount
of
the
check,
when
in
truth
and
fact
this
defendant
then
well
know
that
there
were
no
sufficient
funds.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that's
from
page
3
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
the
indictment
clearly
contains
factual
statements
underlying
an
allegation
of
false
statement.
furthermore,
petitioner's
contention
at
this
state
of
the
litigation
that
the
indictment
does
not
charge
him
with
a
false
statement
was
not
raised
either
before
the
trial
court
or
the
fifth
circuit.
it
is
here
being
raised
for
the
first
time
with
this
court
and
is
reviewable
only
under
the
plain
error
doctrine.
we...
the
government
contends
that
viewing
the
statute
or
reading
the
indictment,
the
clear
language
of
the
indictment
meets
the
sufficiency
requirement
set
forth
by
this
court.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
the
jury
in
this
case,
your
honor,
was
instructed
that
a
check
is
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
section
1014
as
a
matter
of
law
the
only
question
put
to
the
jury
under
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
was
whether
or
not
that
check
or
that
security
was
overvalued.
and
as
even
petitioner
concedes
in
his
reply
brief,
the
question
of
overvaluation
and
false
statement
in
the
context
of
this
case
are
the
same.
the
check
is--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no.
if...
if
a
check
is
not
a
security--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--if
it's
just
property,
for
example;
the
only
question
that
was
put
to
the
jury
was,
is
this
a
false
statement,
is
it
an
overvaluation.
the
jury
concluded
that
the
check
was
a
false
statement,
which
is
a
sufficient
ground
for
conviction
under
the
statute.
so
if
this
court
disagrees
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
check
is
not
a
security--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
but
even
assuming
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
legal
theory,
it's
not
a
security,
the
only
factual
conclusion
reached
at
the
trial
below
was
that
it
was
overvalued.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
but
even
if
that
is
erroneous,
the
fact
still
remains
that
petitioner
was
properly
convicted--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--under
the
theory
that
it
is
a
false
statement.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
of
making
a
false
statement.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
false
statement
is
that
he
would
have
had
money,
that
the
checks
were
represented
by
funds
and
would
have
been
paid
in
the
normal
course
of
collection,
when
in
fact
such
was
not
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
a
bank
upon
a
loan,
advance
or
commitment,
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
count
two
of
the
indictment
clearly
states
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
an
advance
of
money.
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
that
each
check
was
presented
for
the
bank
to
obtain
that
advance,
and
petitioner
did
use
them
to
obtain
that.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no.
all
we
have
to
prove
is
that
the
check
was
deposited
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
bank
upon--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
petitioner
contends
that
a
check
can't
be
a
false--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
right.
it
is
unnecessary
to
get
to
the
overvaluation
of
security
to
sustain
petitioner's
conviction.
petitioner
contends
that
a
check
cannot
be
a
false
statement
because
it
is
simply
a
promise
to
pay
a
sum
certain
upon
presentment
and
notice
of
dishonor.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
because,
your
honor,
this
statute
only
reaches
the
deposit
or
making
of
knowingly
false
statements
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
a
bank
upon
a
loan,
advance
or
commitment.
this
construing
section
1014
to
reach
this
conduct
does
not
sweep
up
all
bad
check
prosecutions
throughout
the
united
states.
bad
check...
state
bad
check
laws
will
continue
to
apply
to
bad
checks
that
are
given
to
the
neighborhood
grocer.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if
that
check
is
deposited
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
am
not
aware.
i
know
that
there
are
many
state--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--excuse
me?
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
the
federally
insured
banks
were
added
to
the
statute
in
1970.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
there
are
numerous
state-chartered
institutions
that
are
not--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
many
of
them
are.
petitioner
contends
that
a
check--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--knowing
that
there
are
insufficient
funds
to
pay
the
check
in
the
course
of
collection,
if
you
intend
to
influence
that
bank
to
extend
you
credit.
now,
for
example,
in
the
circumstances
of
the
crown
case--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no.
take
the
example
of
the
crown
case
the
petitioner
brought...
mentioned
this
morning.
in
that
case
the
defendants
presented
checks
to
a
bank
that
were
drawn
on
a
fictitious
bank.
they
were
merely
deposited
in
someone's
account,
there
was
a
credit
entry.
no
one
was
allowed
to
withdraw
any
funds
against
that
check.
there
was
no
advance
of
credit.
and
the
court
said
there's
no
violation
of
1014
here
because,
although
there's
a
false
statement,
there
was
no
advance
of
credit.
all
there
was
was
a
bookkeeping
entry.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
but
in
the
facts
of
this
case
petitioner
deposited
a
check
on
may
9th,
it
was
immediately
credited
to
his
account
and
to
wipe
out
approximately
$58,000
in
overcharges.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
jury
found
on
the
facts
of
this
case...
the
jury
was
instructed
the
petitioner
could
not
be
convicted
unless
defendant
intended
to
write
checks
which
he
could
not
reasonably
expect
to
cover
and
therefore
defraud
the
bank.
and
on
the
evidence
presented
or
the
evidence
before
the
jury
in
this
case
demonstrated
that
petitioner
certainly
was
aware
that
the
bank--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
depends...
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
factual
question.
it
depends
on
what
the
defendant
intends.
of
course,
the
defendant's
knowledge
of
a
bank's
accounting
practices
would
certainly
be
material
in
determining
whether--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no,
your
honor.
if
there
are
facts
showing
that
he
intended
to
receive
credit.
in
this
case,
on
may
8th
federal
and
state
bank
examiners
arrived
to
commence
an
audit.
there
was
a
$58,000
overcharge
in
his
account.
mr.
williams,
the
petitioner,
was
certainly
and
justifiably
concerned
to
eradicate
this
overdraft
status,
and
he
deposited
the
check
to,
and
he
did
in
fact
achieve--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would...
that
the
intention
to
influence
a
bank
on
an
extension
of
credit
would
have
to
be
a
determination
that
would
be
made
in
light
of
all
of
the
facts
and
evidence
that
was
presented
in
an
individual
case.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in
some
circumstances
i
can
see
that
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no...
he
deposited
the
check
intending
to
obtain
an
extension--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--that
defendant
i
presume
would
have
violated
the
statute
because
he
would
have
presented
a
false
statement
with
the
intent
to
influence
a
bank
upon
an--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--even
though
it
was
impossible.
the
statute
is
geared
to
protect
federally
insured
banks
against
false
statements
that
are
designed
to
influence
them.
whether
or
not
they're
actually
influenced
is
irrelevant.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
because
it
only--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--this
only
extends
to
false
statements
that
are
made
to
federally
insured
banks
for
this
purpose.
the
vast
majority
of
insufficient
funds
checks
cases
do
not
involve
statements
that
are
made
to
federally
insured
banks.
they
involve
statements
that
are
made
to
grocers
or--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--to
a
federally
insured
bank,
yes,
your
honor.
a
check...
the
alternative
ground
for
liability
under
section
1014,
as
we
have
mentioned,
is
that
a
check
constitutes
overvalued
land,
property
or
security.
a
check
clearly
qualifies
as
overvalued
security
within
the
meaning
of
section
1014,
because
the
term
18
of
the
united
states
code
includes
any
item
that
stands
for
some
other
thing
of
value.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
is
generally
applicable,
or
that
definition
may
be
used
to
ascertain
congress'
probable
intent
in
using
the
word
"security"
in
this
statute.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
for
example,
8
u.s.c.
2311,
the
national
stolen
property
act,
and
the
general--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
it's
for
purposes
of
that
act.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it's
not
directly
applicable,
your
honor.
it's
only
applicable
to
show
that
as
the
term
has
been
defined
in
other
contexts,
general
criminal
law
contexts,
it
has
been
defined
to
include
any
item
that
stands
for--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
broad
term
of
the
statute
nevertheless,
we
contend,
should
be
used
consistently
as
the
term
18
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
it's
just
an
alternative
argument
and
this
court
need
not
agree
that
a
check
is
a
security
to
affirm
petitioner's
conviction.
petitioner
spends
considerable
effort
detailing
in
his
brief
the
legislative
history
of
section
1014,
but
he
has
been
unable
to
demonstrate
a
clearly
expressed
legislative
intent
to
exclude
his
conduct
from
the
reach
of
the
statute.
petitioner
at
argues
from
sparse
legislative
history--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--it
is
the
burden
of
the
government,
of
course,
your
honor,
to
show
that
he
is
covered.
but
there
would
be
a
presumption,
i
assume,
the
burden...
in
the
face
of
clear
statutory
language...
this
court
has
often
stated
that
where
you
have
clear
language,
in
the
absence
of
a
clearly
expressed
legislative
intent
to
the
contrary,
the
statute
will
be
given
its
clear
plain
meaning.
the
fact
that
there
is
no
express
mention
of
petitioner's
conduct
in
the
legislative
debates
of
section
1014
is
of
course
irrelevant.
as
this
court
stated
in
barr
v.
united
states,
"if
congress
has
made
a
choice
of
language
that
fairly
brings
a
given
situation
within
a
statute,
it
is
unimportant
that
a
particular
application
might
not
have
been
contemplated
by
the
legislators.
"
the
federalism
concerns
noted
by
petitioner
in
his
brief
and
in
argument
do
not
loom
large
in
this
case.
the
federal
government
has
a
paramount
and
indeed
a
very
important,
a
very
strong
interest
in
maintaining
the
viability
and
the
assets
of
federally
insured
institutions.
the
conclusion
that
section
1014
extends
to
the
presentation
of
all
knowingly
worthless
checks
that
are
presented
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
a
credit
decision
of
a
federally
insured
bank--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--knowingly
overvalued.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if
it
is--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
if
it
is
done
knowingly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
you
have
to
know,
your
honor,
that
the
check
will
not
be
paid
in
the
due
course
of
collection.
plus
in
the
instructions
in
this
case,
the
court
specifically
instructed
the
jury
here
that
petitioner
had
to
be
engaged
in
conduct
where
he
well
knew
that
the
checks
would
never
be
paid
and
he
engaged
in
this
solely
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
time
and
credit.
the
rule
of
lenity
so
often
invoked
by
petitioner
applies
only
where
there
is
a
grievous
ambiguity
in
the
language
or
structure
of
the
act,
that
is
entirely
lacking
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
the
numerous
hyper-technical
objections
to
his
indictment
and
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court,
as
i've
already
mentioned,
were
raised
for
the
first
time
before
this
court
and
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
plain
error
requiring
reversal
of
his
conviction.
petitioner's
final
argument
is
that
his
conviction
must
be
reversed
because
a
check
kiting
conviction
requires
the
prosecution
to
prove
an
intent
to
defraud.
the
short
answer
to
this
contention
is
that
the
petitioner
was
not
indicted
for
check
kiting.
he
was
indicted
for
making
an
intentional
false
statement
or
willfully
overvaluing
a
security
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
a
federally
insured
bank
upon
a
loan,
advance
or
commitment.
each
count
of
his
indictment
clearly
sets
forth
those
facts,
clearly
sets
forth
those
allegations,
and
is
sufficient
to
sustain
a
statutory
violation.
the
term
"check
kiting"
as
used
throughout
this...
the
government's
brief
and
by
petitioner
is
simply
descriptive
of
petitioner's
conduct.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
this
conduct
requires
some
specific
intent
to
defraud
in
order
to
be
culpable,
but
rather
whether
petitioner's
conduct
that
can
be
described
as
check
kiting
falls
within
the
reach
of
a
federal
statute
that
prohibits
intentional
misrepresentations
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
credit
decisions
of
a
federally
insured
bank.
as
stated
in
petition's
reply
brief,
the
overall
question
is
whether
the
allegations
of
counts
two
and
three
are
subject
to
prosecution
under
section
1014,
regardless
of
how
they
are
labeled.
no
matter
how
one
labels
the
conduct
of
petitioner,
it
clearly
comes
within
the
reach
of
section
1014
and
states
a
violation
of
that
statute.
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
