unknown
speaker
all
three
counts
were
under
1014?
unknown
speaker
two
counts.
unknown
speaker
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
funds
to
support
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
something
to
do
with
its
value,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
suppose
that
a
check
could
be
property
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
look
just
at
"security"
in
view
of
the
broader
term
of
"property".
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
says
"other
security",
"other
security".
unknown
speaker
so
i
mean,
the
only
property
it's
talking
about
is
property
that's
security.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
it
does
say
"other
security",
does
it?
unknown
speaker
"or
security",
yes.
it
doesn't
say
"other".
stocks
would
clearly
be
covered,
wouldn't
they,
stocks
or
bonds?
unknown
speaker
you
say
whatever...
you
say
that
it
should
be
read
as
meaning
"other
security".
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
the
legislative
history
helps
you
on
that?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
it
would
help
you
if
it
read
"other
security"
rather
than
just
"security"?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
this
wouldn't...
if
you
were
going
to
a
bank
for
a
loan
and
they
made
you
fill
out
a
loan
application
and
they
wanted
to
know
what
your
assets
were,
and
you
fill
it
out
and
you
overvalued
the
property
that
you
own
by
about
ten
times.
unknown
speaker
and
many
times
banks
don't
take
security
on
all
of
your
property.
they
just
want
to
know
how
much
property
you
got.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
doesn't
mean
collateral.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's
not
just
about
collateral.
unknown
speaker
no,
so
that
you
wouldn't...
so
that
section
isn't
limited
to
property
that's
collateral.
it's
limited...
it
just
says
"property",
if
overvaluing
that
property
might
influence
a
bank
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
must
not
the
statute
be
read
by
having
the
word
"any"
modify
all
the
terms
that
follow,
that
is,
"any
land",
"any
property",
or
"any
security"?
unknown
speaker
could
you
read
it
any
other
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
check
"any
property"?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
bank
practice,
though,
is
to
immediately
credit
the
account,
which
was
true
in
this
case?
if
you
can
immediately
draw
on
that
credit
and
if
it
turns
out
that
the
check
isn't
collected,
the
bank
can
sue
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
certainly
are
extending...
you
certainly
are
getting
credit
from
the
bank
if
the
bank
gives
you...
lets
you
use
that
money
without
ever
having
collected
the
check.
unknown
speaker
well,
long
before
you
get
to
a
constitutional
principle
of
impermissible
vagueness,
you
get
to
some
sort
of
a
principle
of
leniency
in
statutory
construction.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
concede,
then,
that
a
check
is
property--
unknown
speaker
--for
purpose
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
concede
a
check
is
property?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
go
to
a
bank
and
present
a
check
drawn
on
another
bank
and
ask
for
cash
and
the
bank
gives
you
cash
without
having
collected
the
check,
and
you
know
very
well
that
the
check
isn't
any
good,
d
you
think
you've
got
a
loan
from
the
bank?
unknown
speaker
what
have
you
got?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you'd
end
up
owing
the
bank
some
money?
unknown
speaker
have
you
been
extended
credit?
unknown
speaker
like
if
you
give
me
the
cash
or
give
me
the
credit,
you
can
treat
this
check
as
a
note,
and
i
promise
to
pay.
unknown
speaker
i
promise
to
pay
for
this,
pay
you
back
for
this
extension
of
money
or
credit?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
really
any
different
if
you
go
to
the
bank
and
say,
please
loan
me
$500,
and
they
say,
fine,
sign
this
check,
sign
this
note,
and
you
sign
the
note?
unknown
speaker
it
should
be
even
worse,
because
it's
interest-free.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
a
man
that
has
a
good
standing
with
a
particular
bank,
good
standing
in
the
community,
so
he's
trusted--
unknown
speaker
--he
goes
to
the
bank
and
hands
them
a
$50,000
check
on
a
nonexistent
bank,
and
the
signature
is
forged.
would
he
have
violated
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
forged
signature,
but
it's
payable
to
him,
and
the
bank,
because
it
trusts
him,
simply
says,
yes,
here's
your
$50,000.
has
he
violated
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
so?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
i
wonder
if
the
statute
requires
that
credit
be
extended
pursuant
to
a
false
application.
in
other
words,
supposing
you
went
into
a
bank
and
said,
i
want
to
open
a
checking
account
and
i'm
going
to
file
an
application,
and
you
make
a
lot
of
false
statements
on
where
your
other
accounts
are.
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
language
is
awfully
broad.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
such
an
application
were
merely
intended
to
influence
the
bank,
a,
to
open
the
account,
and
b,
to
put
you
on
their
list
of
good
customers,
so
the
next
time
you
come
in
they'll
treat
you
well,
wouldn't
that
violate
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
it
says
it's
a
false
statement
and
so
forth,
upon
any
application,
comma,
advance,
comma,
discount,
comma,
purchase,
purchase
agreement,
repurchase
agreement,
commitment
or
loan.
now,
they'r
making
a
commitment
to
you
that
they'll
deal
with
you
a
a
depositor.
or
any
change
or
extension
or
any
of
the
same--
it's
awfully
broad
language.
but
you
jus
think
it
does
require
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
can
understand
that's
the
central
thrust
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
this
one-sentence
statute,
two
pages
long;
it's
difficult
to
parse
down.
unknown
speaker
but
in
going
to
that
section,
that
part
of
it
that
my
brother
stevens
just
referred
to,
what's
"deferment
of
action
or
otherwise"?
that's
the
broadest
possible,
isn't
it?
"or
otherwise";
it
seems
to
embrace
almost
anything.
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
put
a
check
into
a
bank,
do
you
not,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
influence
the
bank
to
extend
you
the
credit
that
goes
with
that?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
and
see
if
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
question.
a
man
goes
to
the
bank
with
a
$50,000
check.
it's
no
good.
because
of
his
standing,
they
either
give
him
cash
or
let
him
cash
a
check
on
his
personal
account
for
anywhere
up
to
that
amount.
has
not
his
conduct
influenced
the
bank
to
do
something
very
important
here?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
knows
that
it
won't
be...
that's
it's
an
overdraft.
unknown
speaker
well,
surely
the
"willfully"--
unknown
speaker
--what's
the
difference?
what's
the
difference,
except
the
one
is
more
impressive
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
money
had
been
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
made
a
false
representation...
i
realize
that
a
certified
check
may
be
different
in
that
respect.
but
i
thought
you
said
that
a
check
was
not
either
land,
property
or
security,
and
therefore
i
don't
see
why
that
element
of
the
offense
would
be
proved
any
more
by
a
certified
check
than
by
a
personal
check.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
concede
that
a
certified
check
might
violate
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
the
false
statement
has
to
be
with
respect
to
any
land,
property
or
security,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
willfully
overvalue
land,
property
or
security.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
the
second
element...
this
is
in
the
disjunctive,
isn't
it?
those
are
two
separate
offenses,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you...
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
were
saying
the
offense
had
to
show
two
elements,
a
false
statement
and
willful--
unknown
speaker
--i
see
your
point.
unknown
speaker
what
were
you
charged,
what
were
you
charged...
what
was
your
client
charged
with?
was
he
charge
under
one
subsection
or
under
one
clause?
unknown
speaker
which
of
course
it--
unknown
speaker
--your
point...
can
i
just
follow
up?
your
point
is
that
if
their
theory
is
right
any
time
you
deposit
a
check
drawn
on
an
account
that
doesn't
have
enough
funds
in
it
that
you
have
then
violated
the
statute,
because
you've
then
overvalued
a
security--
unknown
speaker
--under
their
view?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
before
you
get
into
that,
is
he
not
correct
that
the
indictment
is
confined
to
the
willfully
overvaluing
portion
of
the
alternatives--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
the
intentional
false
statement
is
not
quoted
in
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
what
if
as
a
matter
of
a
law
a
check
were
not
security
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute?
it
may
have
been
property,
but
you
didn't
say
overvaluing
property.
you
said
a
security.
suppose
as
a
matter
of
law
a
check
was
not
a
security.
and
suppose
count
two
was
the
only
count
in
the
indictment.
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
prove
he
made
a
false
statement,
could
you
convict
him
under
count
two?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
check
were
not
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
you
would
have
to
reverse,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
because
the
jury...
because
the
trial
court
misunderstood
what
a
security
was.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
property,
rather
than
a
security.
unknown
speaker
but
you
charged
that
it
was
a
security
and
that
it
was
overvalued.
unknown
speaker
that's
because
the
judge
took
away
from
the
jury
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
security
or
not,
by
charging
them,
under
justice
white's
hypothesis
erroneously,
that
the
check
was
a
security.
unknown
speaker
of
what?
unknown
speaker
of
what?
unknown
speaker
about
what?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what
the
indictment
alleged
the
falsity
of.
the
falsity
is
that,
"when
in
truth
in
fact,
as
the
defendant
well
know,
there
were
no
sufficient
funds
in
the
other
bank.
"
unknown
speaker
that's
all
that's
required.
unknown
speaker
so
that
all
that...
in
order
to
make
out
the
offense
under
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
you
make
a
deposit
with
a
check
that
you
know
does
not
have
enough
funds
in
the
drawee
bank
at
the
time
of
the
deposit.
unknown
speaker
well,
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
better
bank
account
that
you
can
draw
against.
that's
all
you
allege
here.
in
count
two
all
you
really
do
is
allege
that
the
balance
in
the
account
was
therefore
debited,
i
guess
it
would
be,
and
they
could
therefore
draw
more.
you
don't
allege
an
actual
drawing
against
that
in
count
two.
you
can't
rely
on
count
three.
or
you
don't
even
say
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
anything.
no,
just
that
was
the
illegal
purpose,
that
you
knew
the
other
bank
was
short
of
the
funds.
unknown
speaker
but
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
advance
would
have
been
achieved
whether
he
ever
in
fact
drew
against
the
account,
wouldn't
it?
he's
in
a
position
where
the
balance
has
gone
up,
and
therefore
there
are
funds
he
can
draw
against.
isn't
that
all
you
have
to
prove?
do
you
think
you
had
to
prove
that
there
was
a
drawing,
a
withdrawal,
following
the
deposit?
unknown
speaker
it's
future
course
of
conduct.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
falsity
was
what,
an
implied
representation
that
there
were
funds
to
cover
it--
unknown
speaker
--when
in
fact
he
knew
that
there
were
not?
unknown
speaker
that
then
would
be,
i
gather,
a
conviction
resting
only
on
"whoever
knowingly
makes
any
false
statement
or
report.
"
unknown
speaker
and
you
never
get
to
overvaluing.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
your
theory
is
right,
why
isn't
any
deposit
of
an
insufficient
funds
check
within
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
listened
to
your
exchange
with
justice
stevens,
it
sounded
like
that
was
exactly
what
you
were
saying,
and
that
any
time
somebody
deposits
a
check
knowing
that
there
are
insufficient
funds
to
cover
it
this
section
has
been
violated.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
deposited
in
a
federally
insured
bank.
unknown
speaker
in
a
federally
insured
bank.
that's...
knowing
that
there
aren't
funds
to
cover
it.
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
to
be
a
deposit...
do
we
have
many
no-federally
insured
banks
any
more?
unknown
speaker
this
was
an
addition
to
the
statute,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
this
an
addition
to
the
statute,
the
federally
insured
bank
provision?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
take
in
almost
all
of
the
banks
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
lots
of
state-chartered
institutions
are
federally
insured.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least,
if
i
may
get
through
justice
o'connor's
question,
this
surely
means
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
deposit
a
check
in
a
federally
insured
bank
knowing
that
there
are
insufficient
funds
to
cover
it
and
you've
violated
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
deposit
it
and
they
credit
it
to
my
account,
or
i
cash
it.
in
either
instance,
the
requirement
for
the
purpose
of
extending
credit
is
satisfied,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
some
banks
have
that
as
a
practice.
they
don't...
this
check
that
you've
deposited
is
just
not
subject
to
being
drawn
on
until
we
collect
it.
unknown
speaker
did
he
know
when
he
deposited
it
that
he
would
have
immediate
credit?
unknown
speaker
at
least
you
would
say,
then,
that
any
time
that
somebody
knows
it's
the
custom
of
the
bank
to
give
you
immediate
credit
and
you
deposit
a
check
that
you
know
has
insufficient
funds
behind
it,
but
that
you
know
you'll
get
immediate
credit
that's
useable,
that
then
this
statute
is
violated?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
does
it
depend
on
what
the
defendant
intends
or
does
it
depend
upon
what
the
bank
does
in
its
accounting
practices,
or
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
every
defendant
who
deposits
an
insufficient
funds
check
intend
that
he
receive
credit
for
it?
unknown
speaker
can't
the
trier
of
fact
reasonably
infer
from
any
deposit
slip
that
the
depositor
intends
to
get
credit?
unknown
speaker
but
can
you
conceive
of
anyone
in
their
right
mind
giving
a
bank
a
check
that's
not
sufficient
funds
to
cover
it
and
simply
planning
to
wait
and
let
the
check
go
through
the
clearinghouse
and
be
returned
nsf?
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
isn't
the
intent
of
any
rational
person.
unknown
speaker
so
isn't
justice
o'connor
right
when
she
says
that
anyone
who
presents
an
nsf
check
must
be
planning
to
get
credit
on
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
bank
has
a
practice
of
not
permitting
withdrawals
until
the
check
has
been
collected.
even
though
this
was
not
known
to
the
depositor
and
the
depositor
deposited
it
knowing
that
there
were
insufficient
funds
at
the
time,
would
he
be
guilty
in
that
context?
unknown
speaker
he
did,
but
unknown
to
him
at
the
time
the
bank's
practice
was
it
would
not
permit
any
withdrawals
against
the
check
until
it
had
been
collected.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
was
impossible
that
he--
unknown
speaker
--then
it
seems
to
me,
as
my
colleagues
down
here
have
said,
that
this
covers
every
bad
check
case.
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
you
know
that
you
haven't
got
insufficient...
that
you
do
not
have
sufficient
funds.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
guy's
a
fool
otherwise.
he
must
be.
he
knows
that
the
check
is
no
good
and
he
goes
to
the
bank
and
presents
it.
why
is
he
presenting
it
if
he
knows
he's
not
going
to
get
the
money
until
the
bank
finds
out
that
there's
no
money?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
all
right.
but
then
you
say
it
would
cover
all
cases
presented
to
a
federally--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
now,
you
say
that
it's
been
generally
defined
that
way
throughout
the
united
states...
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
do
you
mean
that
definition
covers
the
word
1014?
unknown
speaker
what
section
do
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
just
defines
it
for
purposes
of
that
act,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well
then
why
do
you
say
it's
applicable
to
this
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
the
inference
is
quite
the
contrary,
that
if
congress
has
taken
occasion
to
define
it
broadly
and
said
for
purposes
of
some
other
act,
the
fact
that
it
has
not
taken
occasion
to
define
it
broadly
here
may
cut
against
you.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
this
is
just
an
alternative
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
feel
it's
the
burden
on
a
criminal
defendant
to
show
that
he's
not
covered
by
the
statute,
or
that
it's
the
burden
of
the
government
to
show
that
he
is
covered
by
it?
unknown
speaker
not
knowingly
worthless,
knowingly
overvalued.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
ten
cents
over,
i
suppose,
and
still...
i
mean,
if
the
amount
in
the
other
account
is
only
a
couple
of
dollars
below
the
amount
of
the
check,
you'd
still
have
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
to
be
worthless--
unknown
speaker
--right.
you
have
to
know
what
your
balance
is.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
you
didn't
know
you
were
facing
a
charge
of
a
false
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
statute
anywhere,
is
there,
that
describes
it
in
terms
of
check
kiting?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
statutes
drafted
that
way.
unknown
speaker
or
even
if
they
don't.
