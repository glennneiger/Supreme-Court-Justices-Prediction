unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
give
you
a
broader
mandate
than
judge
toro
had
done,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
do
those
drugs
have
a
component
of
tranquilizer
in
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schultz,
do
you
disagree
with
the
district
court's
findings
about
the
drugs
themselves,
that
they
are
mind-altering
and
they
have
significant
side
effects
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
one
question--
unknown
speaker
--about
the
basic
facts
that
i
just
didn't
recall
as
you
are
developing
your
argument.
the
institution
houses
both
voluntarily
committed
and
involuntarily
committed
persons.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
rough
proportion
of
the
two?
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
recall
that
those
who
are
voluntarily
committed
do
have
a
right
to
refuse
this
treatment?
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
something
comparable
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
procedure
being
followed
with
respect
to
the
90
percent
who
are
voluntarily
committed?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
basically
what
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
you
must
follow
with
respect
to
the
10
plus
percent,
because
presumably
the
number
would
grow
by
reason
of
the
circumstances
you
describe,
whether
you
must
follow
the
same
procedure
with
respect
to
them
that
you
follow
with
the
other
patients
in
the
hospital.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
has
ordered
you
to
follow
certain
procedures
before
you
involuntarily
administer
these
drugs
to
the
10
percent
who
have
been
involuntarily
committed.
unknown
speaker
and
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
applying
those
procedures,
or
substantially
those
procedures,
as
to
the
90
percent
of
the
people
in
the
hospital.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
10
percent
must
be
treated
like
the
rest
of
the
patients.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
they
don't
leave.
if
you
could.
you
may
not
be
able
to.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schultz,
i
would
like
to
pursue
something
that
may
be
somewhat
similar
to
justice
stevens'
question.
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
required
that
an
individualized
estimation
be
made
by
the
physicians
in
attendance
of
the
possibility
and
type
of
violence
in
which
the
patient
might
engage,
and
the
likely
effects
of
the
particular
drugs
on
the
patient,
and
an
appraisal
of
the
alternative
means
of
treatment,
and
then
if
the
physicians
determine,
having
applied
that
standard,
that
the
drug
should
be
given,
it
may
be
given
involuntarily.
now,
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said.
i
also
believe
that
that
is
the
procedure
that
you
have
outlined
in
your
brief
that
you
assert
the
state
follows
anyway.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
does
massachusetts
require
to
be
found
in
the
case
of
a
commitment?
unknown
speaker
well,
counsel,
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
if
the
physician
determines
that
there
is
this
element
of
violence
which
is
a
possibility,
and
as
you
have
indicated,
to
commit
the
person
in
the
first
place
the
court
had
to
decide
that
violence
was
a
substantial
possibility,
i
don't
understand
why
the
court
of
appeals
requirement
adds
anything
in
addition
to
what
the
doctors
would
be
looking
at
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
here,
the
court
of
appeals
gave
alternative
standards.
it
said
that
the
petitioner...
the
hospital
may
forcibly
administer
drugs
without
a
finding
of
incompetence
if
it
is
reasonably
believed
to
be
necessary
to
prevent
further
deterioration
in
the
patient's
mental
health
or
the
other
standard
that
i
have
been
talking
to
you
about.
unknown
speaker
now,
isn't
that
enough
to
encompass
the
patient's
needs
and
the
hospital's
needs
as
well?
unknown
speaker
in
addition
to
the
initial
finding
on
commitment.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
one
of
the
exceptions
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
modified
the
district
court
was
that
the
patient
could
be
forcibly
medicated
without
a
finding
of
incompetence
when
it
is
reasonably
believed
to
be
necessary
to
prevent
further
deterioration
of
the
patient's
mental
health.
well,
what
they
say
is
for
the
significant
deterioration,
and
you
run
into
two
situations.
first
of
all,
what
does
significant
mean?
you
take
the
rennie
versus
klein
case.
i
will
use
that
as
an
example
of
the
facts.
this
is
an
individual
who
slowly,
when
the
district
court
told
him
he
couldn't
be
forcibly
medicated,
he
slowly
deteriorated.
where
was
the
significant
deterioration?
it
was
on
a
daily
basis,
until
his
life
was
endangered.
because
of
the
district
court
opinion
that
you
had
to
have
a
determination
of
incompetency,
mr.
rennie's
life
was
unnecessarily
endangered.
so
why
not
focus
on
significant?
second
of
all,
you
have
the
problem
of,
we
are
talking
about
a
milieu
setting.
what
about
the
patient
who
is
seriously
ill,
who
is
suffering,
who
is
in
agony
and
distress,
but
isn't
deteriorating?
he
is
already
so
deteriorated.
what
about
that
particular
patient?
i
think
it
is
important
to
maybe
look
again
at
some
of
the
examples.
maybe
i
can
help
answer
your
question
by
looking
at
some
specifics
of
what
is
in
the
record
of
this
case.
i
have
an
example
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
her
name
is
betty
bybel,
and
the
testimony
is
that
when
betty
bybel
was
deteriorated,
not
only
could
she
become
violent,
but
one
thing
she
would
do
is
sadistically
taunt
the
other
patients
about
their
personal
lives,
causing
a
deterioration
in
their
health.
that
wouldn't
fall
under
any
of
these
exceptions,
yet
under
the
first
circuit
betty
bybel
is
going
to
continue
to
cause
the
other
patients
to
deteriorate.
the
record
is
that
when
betty
bybel
would
start
yelling,
everybody
would
start
yelling.
that
is
not
covered
under
either
of
those
exceptions.
there
is
no
significant
deterioration
in
betty
bybel.
there
is
nothing
about
dangerousness,
but
the
hospital
is
going
wacky,
and
going...
the
hospital
is
going
up
at
that
time,
because
of
the
effect
in
the
milieu,
which
is
not
discussed
in
either
of
the
opinions.
you
have
an
example
of
another
patient,
james
colleran.
he
would
sadistically
taunt
female
patients
sexually.
all
right.
for
the
female
patients,
you
might
have
the
question
of
dangerousness,
but
what
happens
is
that
he
set
up
some
of
the
male
patients
who
had
their
own
sexual
hang-ups
and
couldn't
stand
james
colleran
taunting
the
female
patients,
and
the
male
patients'
illnesses
deteriorated,
and
there
are
just
example
upon
example
of
example
of
these
kinds
of
situations,
and
you
must
recognize
that
we
are
talking
about
a
milieu
here,
we
are
talking
about
the
state's
ability
to
perform
its
legitimate
objective
of
maintaining
order
in
these
hospitals,
and
neither
opinion
deals
with
this
very
fundamental
reason
that
there
should
not
be
a
right
to
refuse
treatment.
mr.
schultz,
you
say
that
treatment
with
antipsychotic
drugs
is
the
standard
fare
with
maybe
90
percent/or
at
least
the
great
majority
of
your
patients.
there
is
a
group
of
patients
that
you
don't
use
drugs
on.
unknown
speaker
so
you
must
have
some
criteria,
some
criterion
for
separating
out
those
you
use
them
on
and
the
ones
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
medical
judgment.
well,
if
the
courts
had
said
to
you,
well,
you
have
two
groups,
the
ones
you
use
them
on
and
the
ones
you
don't,
if
you
decide
that
a
certain
person
belongs
in
the
group
that
you
are
going
to
give
drugs
to,
you
should
go
through
a
procedure
to
decide
that.
now,
do
you
say
that
those...
nothing
about
the
commitment
helps
you
decide
which
group
you
give
the
drugs
to
and
which
you
don't.
they
have
all
gone
through
this
process
of
being
involuntarily
committed.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
there
had
to
be
some
findings
before
there
was
an
involuntary
commitment,
either
danger
to
themselves,
to
others,
or
they
couldn't
take
care
of
themselves.
the
reason
you
have
committed
them
is
for
treatment
maybe,
but
nevertheless
you
had
to
make
those
findings.
unknown
speaker
could
you
be
specific
on
what
type
of
review
the
hospitals
do
employ?
could
you
describe--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
discussed
with
the
patient?
unknown
speaker
are
the
patients'
desires
concerning
medication
considered
then?
unknown
speaker
and
do
the
physicians
consider
the
dangerousness
of
the
patient
or
the
propensity
for
violence?
unknown
speaker
and
they
consider
the
alternative
forms
of
treatment
for
medication?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
they
consider
in
these
rounds
or
in
these
meetings
whether
the
patient
needed
the
medication,
what
do
you
mean
by
need?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
that
they
need
the
medication?
need
it
for
what?
need
it
for
treatment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schultz,
does
the
record
show
anything
about
the
adequacy
of
staffing
in
these
hospitals?
we
hear
a
lot
of
complaints
over
the
country
about
understaffing,
insufficient
number
of
psychiatrists
and
other
attendants.
does
the
record
show
anything
here?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
from
your
remarks,
these
frequent
sessions
and
the
like,
that
there
was
no
problem
with
staffing.
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
let
me
put
one
at
you
that
we
have
got
you
stopped.
i
get
a
feeling
reading
this
record,
the
massive
record,
this
case
went
on
how
many
weeks?
unknown
speaker
i
get
a
feeling,
and
i
wonder
what
your
reaction
is,
whether
i
am
being
led
astray,
that
the
judges,
as
we
judges
tend
to
do,
were
reading
this
testimony
in
this
record
as
though
mental
illness,
psychiatric
problems,
are
like
physical
illness,
that
you
can
take
someone's
temperature
or
pulse
or
blood
test
and
then
you
know
something
about
what
is
going
on
inside
that
person.
is
that
a
strange
reaction
that
i
get,
or
would
you--
unknown
speaker
--a
diabetic
patient,
for
example,
if
he
is
getting
near
diabetic
coma,
they
can
find
that
out
by
a
blood
test,
can't
they?
but
you
are
saying
that
you
can't
do
that
with
the
psychotic
or
the
schizophrenic.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schultz,
i
take
it
there
is
a
regular
procedure
at
these
hospitals
for
periodically
determining
if
the
grounds
for
commitment
still
exist.
unknown
speaker
so
that
presumably
in
between...
just
take
a
particular
patient,
mr.
a.
in
between
the
times
that
his
case
is
reviewed
for
that
purpose
and
the
next
time
it
is
reviewed
for
that
purpose,
presumably
he
still
fits
the
definition
of
a
proper
committee,
that
he
is
either
dangerous
to
himself
or
to
others
or
can't
take
care
of
himself.
unknown
speaker
so
we
are
talking
about...
the
court
of
appeals
is
talking
about
saying
you
must
determine...
you
must
get
the
consent
of
someone
who
right
now
is
dangerous
to
himself
or
to
others
or
can't
take
care
of
himself.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
don't
qualify
any
longer
for
commitment,
they
should
be
turned
loose.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schultz,
the
opinion
in
this
case
is
based,
of
course,
in
part
on
the
fact
that
in
massachusetts
someone
can
be
an
involuntarily
committed
patient
and
under
massachusetts
law
is
still
competent
legally
to
make
a
variety
of
decisions.
is
that
not
true?
unknown
speaker
dispose
of
property.
unknown
speaker
can
they
vote
in
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
well,
part
of
the
decision
here
may
be
affected,
may
it
not,
by
this
provision
of
massachusetts
law
providing
that
they
continue
to
be
legally
competent,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schultz,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
apart
from
procedures
that
have
been
adopted
in
response
to
this
litigation...
just
assume
we
didn't
have
the
case...
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
hospital
draws
any
distinction
in
its
day
to
day
administration
between
voluntarily
and
involuntarily
committed
patients?
unknown
speaker
the
voluntary
patient
always
had
the
right
to
leave.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
other
than
that,
in
terms
of
medical
decisions
and
the
like,
they
are
treated
alike?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schultz,
we
have
been
taking
your
time
that
you
wanted
to
reserve
to
reply,
and
perhaps
the
court
will
give
you
additional
time.
you
have
not
responded
to
the
motion
of
the
other
side
that
we
dismiss
this
case
in
light
of
the
court's
decision
in
your
state
in
roe.
unknown
speaker
you
did
briefly,
but
that
is
a
rather
important
issue,
at
least
for
me.
unknown
speaker
without
going
into
that
detail,
let
me
ask
you
this.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
roe
decision
changed
the
law
of
massachusetts
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
totally
irrelevant
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
about
the
record.
does
the
record
indicate
what
happened
in
the
event
that
there
were
commitment
proceedings?
were
the
patients
who
refused
treatment
invariably
committed?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
are
able
to
weigh
it.
unknown
speaker
who
says
they
are
able
to
weigh
it?
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
district
court
know
about
these
things,
any
more
than
most
judges
know
about
the
processes
that
go
on
in
a
medical
hospital?
unknown
speaker
and
this
should
be
ultimately
relegated
to
the
decision
of
one
district
judge,
or
of
a
court
of
appeals,
or,
for
that
matter,
this
court?
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
these
people
are
competent
adult
persons,
of
these
inmates?
unknown
speaker
all
of
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
i
understand
your
view
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
being
committed
for
statutory
reasons
and
being
mentally
incompetent.
is
it
your
view
that
the
test
of
incompetence
for
things
such
as
making
wills
and
voting
and
entering
into
contracts
should
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
test
for
competence
to
make
this
medical
decision?
unknown
speaker
but
are
there
grades
of
incompetence
in
massachusetts?
you
could
be
incompetent
to
vote,
but
not
to
enter
into
a
contract
or
not
to
make
a
will?
unknown
speaker
under
massachusetts
law,
is
the
test
of
competence
merely
one
of
the
intellectual
ability
to
know
what
is
best
for
oneself,
or
does
it
also
require
something
to
do
with
the
kind
of
self-discipline
that
might
be
necessary
to
make
the
decision?
unknown
speaker
some
people
weigh
the
benefits
and
risks
of
stopping
smoking,
but
then
they
go
ahead
and
smoke.
unknown
speaker
the
test
is
really
an
intellectual
test.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
say
here
is
a
particular
person
who
is
involuntarily
committed,
and
there
has
been
the
proper
finding
that
he
is
either
dangerous
to
himself
or
to
others
or
he
can't
take
care
of
himself
by
reason
of
mental
illness,
and
so
he
is
committed,
and
the
judge
has
found
that
he
is
in
that
condition.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
is
found
that
he
cannot
take
care
of
himself
by
reason
of
some
mental
illness?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
same,
in
or
out.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
same,
inside
or
outside.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
are
dangerous
to
yourself,
i
suppose
it
is
the
same
inside
or
outside.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
the
day
after
he
is
committed,
and
he
goes
into
the
institution,
the
doctor
says,
i
want
to
treat
him,
i
want
to
give
him
an
antipsychotic
drug.
now,
you
say
at
that
point
the
doctor
must
go
through
some...
he
must
decide
whether
the
person
is
competent
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
if
the
doctor
decides
in
his
own
mind
that...
he
says,
this
person
right
this
very
minute
is
either...
is
dangerous
to
himself
or
to
others
or
he
can't
take
care
of
himself
by
reason
of
mental
illness.
now,
suppose
he
says,
of
those
three,
this
person
is
dangerous
to
others,
right
now.
now,
does
he...
is
that
mutually
exclusive
to
being
competent
to
decide
whether
to
take
a
drug?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
have
very
great
difficulty
understanding.
he
might
be
very
competent,
but
can
you
be
competent
to
refuse
treatment
that
the
doctor
wants
to
administer
to
keep
you
from
hurting
others?
unknown
speaker
well,
any
time
then...
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
will
be
no
barrier
to
any
doctor
who
says,
this
person
is
dangerous
to
others,
or
this
person
is
dangerous
to
himself,
or
he
can't
take
care
of
himself
by
reason
of
mental
illness
right
this
very
minute?
then
competency
is
beside
the
point?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
either.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
have
brought
the
suit
if
that
was
all
that
was
involved.
unknown
speaker
who
if
they
were
out
might
be
committable
but
if
they
are
in,
they
are
not
necessarily
dangerous
to
anybody
or
themselves.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
what
you
object
to
in
the
medical
decision.
i
don't
suppose
the
doctors
involved
are
just
interested
in
giving
medication
willy-nilly.
there
is
a
range
of
reasons
that
they
use,
i
suppose.
what
reasons
do
you
particularly
object
to?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
he
giving
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
suggest
that
even
if
those
are
the
reasons,
and
valid
ones,
nevertheless
the
patient
should
be,
if
he
is
competent,
should
be
able
to
say,
sorry,
i
don't
care
to
take
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
patient,
if
he
is
competent,
should
say,
well,
i
would
rather
be
the
way
i
am
than
be
that
other
way.
unknown
speaker
not
25
to
50
percent
of
the
class.
you
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
many?
unknown
speaker
because
i
got
the
impression
from
the
district
court's
finding
that
this
is
a
very
serious
possible
side
effect,
but
the
actual
litigants,
at
least
the
named
plaintiffs,
you
are
right,
had
not
suffered
that.
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
a
danger,
but
one
that
didn't
materialize
very
often
within
this
class.
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
be
correct
that
when
a
patient
gets
that...
is
in
that
unfortunate
group,
that
somebody
has
made
a
medical
misjudgment?
unknown
speaker
the
difficulty
with
your
argument
that
i
see,
at
least,
is
that
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
accurately
appraise
the
risk,
it
seems
to
me
the
less
wisdom
there
is
in
saying
that
the
layman
should
make
the
medical
judgment.
unknown
speaker
but
even
a
competent
doctor
apparently
can't
appraise
it
accurately.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
of
course
this
doesn't
show
up
until
there
has
been
medication
over
a
prolonged
period
of
time,
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
apply
the
same
procedures
justice
white
asked
you
about
where
the
man
is
dangerous
to
himself
and
so
forth,
you
would
apply
the
same
procedure
whether
the
patient
has
ever
had
the
drug
before
or
whether
he
has
been
using
it
for
ten
years.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
this
is
the
more
serious
one,
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
cole,
suppose
the
doctor
says,
well,
the
reason
i
am
interested
in
giving
these
drugs
is,
i
think
i
can
maybe
restore
you
to
the
community,
maybe
even
cure
you,
or
at
least
get
you
stable
enough
that
i
can
turn
you
loose,
and
the
state
has
a
major
interest
in
doing
that,
no
matter
what
you
think.
now,
is
that
an
improper
consideration?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
it
is
a
consideration
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
trying
to
remove
these
people
from
the
institution
if
they
can
by
curing
them.
unknown
speaker
is
anyone
in
this
whole
universe
of
patients
ever
released
because
they
have
gotten
better
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
not
many?
unknown
speaker
enough
that
some
people
are
released.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
their
interest
isn't
satisfied.
their
interest
is,
they
don't
want
to
keep
the
people
there.
that
is
a
great
expense
to
the
taxpayer.
they
want
to
get
them
out
if
they
can.
what
is
wrong
with
that
as
an
interest?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
person
should
be
able
to
say,
sorry,
no,
i
would
rather
stay
here,
and
live
on
you
for--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
have
decided
to
get
him
in
to
treat
him,
that
he
is
dangerous,
they
want
to
treat
him,
and
perhaps
he
will
no
longer
be
dangerous.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
the
state,
if
it
came...
if
push
came
to
shove
in
a
situation
like
this,
would
be
free
to
release
the
person--
unknown
speaker
--if
they
felt
the
person
were
so
disruptive
and
still
refused
to
submit
to
what
the
doctors
thought
was
proper
medication?
unknown
speaker
no.
if
he
is
just
such
a
disruptive
force
in
the
hospital
that
although
all
the
reasons
for
commitment
were
still
there,
his
right
to
refuse
treatment
is
producing
such
a
disruptive
effect
that
the
state
says,
we
would
rather
have
one
guy
like
this
on
the
outside
rather
than
have
him
on
the
inside,
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
committing
court
gave
them
permission?
is
there
any
constitutional
argument
against
their
doing
it?
unknown
speaker
and
restrain
him--
unknown
speaker
--doesn't
the
doctor
run
some
risk
of
being
second-guessed
in
a
1983
action?
unknown
speaker
they
are
still
subject
to
a
jury
trial.
they
may
have
to
litigate
forever.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the...
of
course,
this
is
a
constitutional
case.
we
are
trying
to
decide
what
the
constitution
requires
massachusetts
to
do,
and
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
if
massachusetts
passed
a
statute
and
said
that
a
commitment
this
kind,
even
if
accompanied
by
a
finding
that
this
kind
of
treatment
may
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
patient,
and
the
finding
specifically
authorized
the
doctor
to
administer
this
treatment
whenever
it
was
found
to
be,
after
a
full
hearing
and
all
the
rest,
in
the
best
interest
of
the
patient,
he
still
couldn't...
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
because
your
standard
is
that
as
long
as
the
individual
is
mentally
competent
to
make
the
decision,
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse,
notwithstanding
medical
judgment
that
it
would
be
in
his
best
interest
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i
am
talking
about
the
non-violent,
the
non-violent
person
but
does
have
an
illness
of
some
kind
that
there
is
a
reasonable
difference
of
opinion
on
whether
he
could
be
cured,
and
a
medical
judgment,
the
state
could
not
provide
that
the
medical
judgment
would
ever
prevail
over
his
will
if
he
is
intelligent
enough
to
weigh
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
you
have
been
talking
about
the
right
of
patients
in
massachusetts
to
refuse
treatment.
does
that
right
extend
in
your
state
to
the
right
to
die?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
patient
is
in
a
condition
that
is
terminal.
the
doctor
so
advises
him,
and
says,
we
can
keep
you
alive
for
another
year
or
two
or
three
by
these
treatments,
and
the
patient
says
no,
the
illness
is
terminal,
i
have
a
right
under
massachusetts
law
to
refuse
treatment.
is
that
the
law
of
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
the
right
to
refuse
treatment
in
massachusetts
includes
the
right
to
die?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
would
you
clarify
for
me
your
position
as
to
the
constitutional
right
that
may
exist
for
the
patient
who
is
committed
and
who
is
incompetent
by
court
finding?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
states
have
commitment
laws
that
incorporate
a
finding
of
incompetence?
unknown
speaker
or
have
the
effect
of
incompetence
by
virtue
of
the
commitment?
unknown
speaker
what
happens,
laying
aside
for
a
moment
the
mental
illness
problem,
what
happens
if
a
patient
develops
an
attack
which
the
hospital
physician
diagnoses
as
possible
ruptured
appendix
that
should
be
operated
on
immediately.
do
they
have
to
get
the
consent
of
the
patient?
unknown
speaker
well,
competent.
you
have
used
that
phrase
so
much,
but
how
many
of
the
people
in
this
10
percent
are
competent
in
the
sense
that
they
are
capable
of
making
the
day
to
day
decisions
of
life
that
presumably
the
rest
of
us
outside
are
capable
of
making?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
expert
testimony
as
to
the
percentage
of
serious
schizophrenic
patients
who
ever
get
well?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
be
very
important
for
any...
if
judges
are
going
to
get
into
this
business,
wouldn't
it
be
important
to
know
whether
certain
categories
of
mental
illness
are
treatable
and
have
any
possibility
of
recovery
and
some
are
not?
that
is
certainly
known,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
different
from
being
cured.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
expert
testimony
that
pointed
out
that
a
great
many
patients
who
show
improvement,
not
a
cure,
but
an
improvement
in
the
protected
environment
of
a
hospital
nevertheless
are
not
subject
to
release
because
if
they
are
out
of
that
protected
environment,
with
all
the
stresses
of
outside
life,
they
would
regress?
was
there
any
testimony
along
that
line?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question
about
your
constitutional
theory?
i
take
it
your
claim
of
a
constitutional
liberty
interest
here
is
limited
to
the
case
in
which
there
is
this
kind
of
very
serious
permanent
damage?
but
you
make
the
same
claims,
to
the
patient,
assuming
a
competent
and
non-dangerous
person,
to
refuse
less
severe
treatment,
such
as
flu
shots
or
an
exercise
program
or
something
he
just
didn't
want
to
do.
you
wouldn't
contend
he
had
a--
unknown
speaker
--but
a
non-committed
person
would
have
a
right
to
refuse
those
things,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
used
as
non-punishment.
unknown
speaker
for
it
to
be
a
constitutional
violation,
are
you
taking
the
view
that
it
has
to
be
viewed
as
a
form
of
punishment?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
what
you
object
to
and
a
man
refusing
flu
shots?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking,
is
that
what
you
are
asking
us
to
hold.
say
he
doesn't
want
to
go
on
an
exercise
program,
he
is
overweight
or
something.
unknown
speaker
crosses
what
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
is
a
fundamental
liberty
interest
if
i
don't
want
flu
shots.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
just
give
me
in
a
word
what
you
think
the
decision...
what
is
the
name
of
the
decision?
unknown
speaker
in
a
word,
what
is
the
impact,
if
any,
of
that
case
on
this
one?
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
just
competent
persons?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
competent
person,
so
that
if
a
person
is
competent,
the
state
foreswears
any
parens
patriae
interest
in
treating
him?
unknown
speaker
over
his
objection.
unknown
speaker
so
that
means
that
under
state
law
necessarily
you
are
going
to
have
to
sort
out
the
competent
from
the
incompetent.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
exactly
what
you
want
done.
unknown
speaker
and
also
if
he
is
competent,
that
case
provides
exactly
what
you
want
done.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
we
should...
did
you
move--
unknown
speaker
--to
what,
remand?
unknown
speaker
dismiss
as
moot?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
decide
whether
this
case
is
mooted
out
by
the
decision
of
the
massachusetts
court.
if
you
are
right,
we
should
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
you
don't
need
it.
unknown
speaker
your
judgment
should
be
vacated.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
mean
what
you
say,
that
is
exactly
what
we
should
do.
that
would
be
our
normal
practice,
is
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
order
the
dismissal
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
we
should
vacate
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
there
is
anything
left
of
the
case
or
not.
unknown
speaker
should
we
do
that
or
should
the
court
of
appeals
do
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
certification.
we
may,
of
course,
under
blotty,
we
may
certify.
unknown
speaker
why
should
we?
why
shouldn't
we
leave
that
to
the
court
of
appeals?
you
say
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
the
police
power
aspect.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
could
do
a
better
job
of
it
than
we
can.
unknown
speaker
certainly
the
roe
case
is
factually
distinguishable
from
this
in
the
sense
that
it
involved
non-institutionalized
patients.
am
i
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
get
from
your
position
that
if
judges
are
going
to
be
running
your
institution,
you
would
rather
have
massachusetts
judges
doing
it?
is
that
right?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
what
was
your
motion
filed
here?
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
granted
your
motion
to
dismiss,
it
would
be
on
the
grounds
of
mootness,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
want
us
to
grant
your
motion.
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
moot?
do
you
think
the
case
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
because
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
lawsuit.
that
satisfies
everything.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
case
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
your
motion
was
to
dismiss
as
moot.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know
whether
it
is
moot.
unknown
speaker
so
you
withdraw
your
motion?
unknown
speaker
should
it
be
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
possible...
i
am
sorry.
is
it
possible
that
although
they
haven't
squarely
decided
it,
that
massachusetts
law
might
require
the
very
procedures
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
ordered?
do
we
know
that
massachusetts
law
does
not
require
these
procedures?
unknown
speaker
did
roe
rest
on
the
united
states
constitution
at
all?
unknown
speaker
did
the
roe
decision
rest
on--
unknown
speaker
--did
it
rest
on
it?
unknown
speaker
did
the
supreme
judicial
court
rest
the
decision
on
it?
unknown
speaker
on
what
provision
of
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
didn't
roe
expressly
disavow
any
intent
to
decide
an
involuntarily
committed
patient's
right
to
refuse
medication?
