mr.
stephen
schultz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
argument
today
i
would
like
to
focus
on
what
the
defendants
believe
to
be
the
two
fundamental
reasons
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
refuse
treatment.
first
would
be
that
allowing
one
patient
to
refuse
treatment
is
necessarily
going
to
negatively
impair
the
state's
ability
to
perform
its
legitimate
objective
of
maintaining
order
in
its
hospitals,
and
second
of
all,
of
treating
those
patients
who
are
not
themselves
refusing
treatment.
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
to
allow
one
patient
to
refuse
treatment,
there
will
necessarily
be
an
increase
of
violence
in
our
institutions.
the
first
circuit
talks
about
allowing
forced
medication
for
emergency
situations,
but
they
simply
do
not
focus
on
the
fact
of
the
unpredictability
of
violence
in
mentally
ill
patients,
the
impulsivity
of
violent
acts,
the
fact
that
mental
patients
are
acting
upon
irrational
thoughts,
and
that
this
simply
cannot
always
be
predicted.
the
second--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--there
is
no
doubt
that
the
first
circuit
opinion
in
our
mind
is
less
wrong
than
the
district
court
opinion.
i
could
say
that
maybe
less
people
will
be
hurt
under
the
first
circuit
opinion
than
would
be
hurt
under
the
district
court
opinion.
i
hardly
feel
that
justifies
the
opinion.
the
second
point
that
i
want
to
make
as
to
this
first
fundamental
reason
is
that
if
you
allow
one
patient
to
remain
in
your
hospital
in
a
deteriorated
state,
this
is
going
to
affect
the
health
of
other
patients,
whether
or
not
there
is
violence.
a
hospital
is
a
milieu
setting,
and
if
you
have
patients
who
are
deteriorated,
this
will
set
off
the
illnesses
of
other
patients,
and
i
will
talk
about
this
more
later.
the
second
major
point
that
i
want
to
discuss
in
argument
today
which
we
believe
to
be
a
second
fundamental
reason
is
that
we
suggest
that
the
original
decision
to
commit
an
individual
against
his
will
for
treatment
purposes
when
it
is
known
at
the
time
that
the
patient
is
committed
that
antipsychotic
medications
are
a
necessary
part
of
the
treatment
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
seriously
mentally
ill
acts
as
a
sufficient
predicate
for
the
later
administration
of
this
medication
against
the
patient's
will
after
the
commitment.
in
other
words,
let
me
just
reword
what
we
consider
this
basic
argument
to
be
all
about.
there
is
no
determination
of
incompetency
at
the
time
that
a
patient
is
committed,
yet
the
state
is
empowered,
despite
this
lack
of
a
finding
of
incompetency,
is
empowered
to
commit
an
individual
against
his
will
for
treatment.
we
suggest
similarly
without
any
finding
of
incompetency
the
state
should
be
empowered
to
carry
out
that
treatment
against
the
patient's
will
which
was
ordered
at
the
time
of
commitment.
in
order
to
fully
understand
these
two
fundamental
arguments
that
we
believe
necessitate
there
being
a
finding
of
no
right
to
refuse
treatment,
i
think
it
is
first
necessary
to
focus
very,
very
briefly
on
what
exactly
is
the
role
of
antipsychotic
medications
in
our
state
hospitals.
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear
that
antipsychotic
medications
are
a
necessary
part
of
the
treatment
for
the
vast
majority
of
seriously
mentally
ill
patients.
mr.
stephen
schultz
they
do,
but
they
are
not
very
good
tranquilizers.
you
shouldn't
use
them
and
it
wouldn't
be
proper
practice
to
use
them
as
a
tranquilizer.
they
are
a
poor
tranquilizer,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
do
tranquilize,
the
sedative
effects
wear
off
in
two
or
three
weeks.
if
you
want
to
tranquilize,
there
are
other
drugs
which
are
tranquilizers.
we
are
talking
about
a
specific
group
of
patients,
and
it
must
be
recognized,
and
that
group
of
patients
are
patients
who
are
so
seriously
mentally
ill
that
they
could
be
committed,
plus
it
is
acceptable
medical
practice
to
use
antipsychotic
medications
for
those
patients.
mr.
stephen
schultz
i
certainly
disagree
with
the
finding
that
they
are
mind-altering.
what
they
do
is
restore
a
chemical
imbalance
in
the
brain
to
the
original
balance.
it
is
the
psychosis
that
is
mind-altering,
as
i
think
a
very
cogent
article
points
out.
the
non-conformist
treated
of
his
illness,
the
psychotic
non-conformist
will
remain
a
non-conformist.
a
conformist
treated
of
his
illness
will
remain
a
conformist.
they
don't
alter
the
mind.
the
psychosis
alters
the
mind.
as
for
the
effects,
the
side
effects,
there
are
side
effects,
but
simply
put,
the
state's
position,
and
i
think
the
first
circuit
so
found,
is
that
the
dangers
of
psychosis
untreated
are
far
greater
than
the
dangers
of
any
of
these
side
effects.
the
one
other
point
that
i
can
point
out
about
the
side
effects
is
that
there
has
sort
of
been
a
pendulum
in
the
knowledge
of
these
side
effects.
at
first
there
wasn't
much
knowledge
of
them.
then
everybody
thought
everything
was
a
side
effect,
and
now
they
are
finding
that
the
side
effects
are
more
limited
than
they
thought,
and
are
certainly
more
treatable.
let
me
turn
back
to
the
question
of
what
these
medications
are
all
about.
a
point
which
the
defendants
want
to
emphasize
is
not
only
is
the
record
clear
that
these
medications
are
effective
when
taken
voluntarily;
the
record
is
also
overwhelming
that
these
medications
are
effective
when
forcibly
administered,
the
district
court's
finding
notwithstanding.
there
is
no
way...
to
argue
that
these
drugs
are
not
administered...
are
not
effective
when
administered
forcibly
simply
ignores
the
tens
of
case
histories
in
this
case
of
patients
who
refused
antipsychotic
medication
and
deteriorated,
and
then
against
their
will
were
forcibly
medicated
and
improved,
and
there
is
simply
no
explanation
for
that
other
than
the
fact
that
these
are
chemicals,
and
they
make
the
brain...
they
restore
an
imbalance,
and
this
balance
is
restored
whether
or
not
a
person
voluntarily
takes
these
medications
or
whether
a
person
is
forced
to
take
these
medications.
let
me
turn
to
what
the
commonwealth
feels
is
another
very
important
point
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
recognition
that
we
are
talking
about
seriously
mentally
ill
individuals,
as
the
patients
who
have
been
given
the
right
to
refuse
medication,
and
specifically,
what
do
we
know
about
the
serious
mental
illness
which
is
sufficient
to
commit
an
individual?
we
know
that
an
acutely
psychotic
patient
is
terrorized,
in
a
state
of
panic,
unbearable
agony,
pain,
and
distress.
that
is
undisputed
in
the
record.
we
know
that
schizophrenic
patients,
which
are
the
majority
of
patients
for
whom
it
would
be
a
proper
practice
to
give
antipsychotic
medications,
don't
think
rationally,
that
they
think
on
their
own
autistic
terms.
we
know
that
a
classic
symptom
of
mental
illness
which
leads
these
patients
to
being
committed
is
ambivalence,
including
ambivalence
to
treatment.
we
know
that...
it
is
undisputed
in
the
record
that
many,
many
patients
who
were
forcibly
medicated
in
the
past,
after
they
were
forcibly
medicated,
thanked
the
doctors
for
forcibly
medicating
them
when
they
weren't
speaking
their
own
true
mind.
now,
despite--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--certainly.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
schultz
i
believe
it
is
90
percent
voluntary
and
around
10
percent
involuntary.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
massachusetts
the
laws
changed
in
1970
requiring
you
to,
even
if
you
could
commit
somebody,
ask
them
if
you
wanted
them
to
come
in
voluntarily,
because
they
felt
there
would
be
a
benefit
to
patients
being
voluntary
patients.
there
is
not
necessarily
much
of
a
difference
in
the
illnesses
between
the
two.
mr.
stephen
schultz
or
leave
the
hospital,
or
face
a
petition
for
their
commitment.
mr.
stephen
schultz
yes,
except
that
many
of
them...
it
used
to
be
felt
that
you
could
ask
them
to
leave
the
hospital
and
if
you
didn't
you
could
forcibly
medicate
them.
now
what
is
happening
is,
after
this
opinion,
if
you
feel
they
have
to
be
forcibly
medicated,
they
are
making
them
involuntary
patients.
so
when
the
patient
refuses
medication
now,
there
could
well
be
a
shift
in
this
percentage,
given
if
the
kind
of
opinions
that
the
first
circuit
and
the
district
court
issued
would
have
become
the
law.
i
simply
don't
know
the
statistics
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
change
over
the
last
several
years.
mr.
stephen
schultz
i
am
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
schultz
well,
what
they
are
doing
with
the
90
percent
is
saying,
you
have
a
choice
of
leaving,
if
you
want,
and
if
you
don't,
we
are
going
to
make
you
an
involuntary
patient.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
schultz
no,
that
is
not
right,
because
what
they...
first,
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is,
they
set
up
two
procedures
for
what
they
call
dangerous
patients
and
non-dangerous
patients.
what
happened
before
the
temporary
restraining
order,
there
was
no
decision
about
dangerousness.
it
was
recognized
that
this
was
not
something
which
was
predictable
necessarily
for
these
patients.
it
was
decided
whether
or
not
the
medication
was
medically
necessary
on
an
individual
basis,
but
there
was
never
a
decision
made
on,
do
i
believe
that
because
the
possibility
of
dangerous
outweighs
the
individual's
private
rights,
which
is
what
the
individual
decision
has
to
be
according
to
the
first
circuit,
that
decision
wasn't
made.
yes,
it
was
an
individual
determination,
but
the
questions
that
were
asked
were
quite
different.
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
point
of
who
these
patients
are,
because
i
want
to
talk
briefly,
because
the
state,
i
think,
has
been
misconstrued
on
this
point
in
both
courts
below,
on
who
is
this
competent
mentally
ill
patient
that
is
talked
about
by
the
two
courts
below.
the
district
court
found
that
a
majority
of
the
committed
patients
are
capable
of
appreciating
the
benefits,
the
risks,
the
side
effects
of
these
medications.
the
commonwealth
suggests
simply
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
in
the
record
for
that
finding,
but
putting
that
aside,
the
major
problem
with
both
the
district
court
opinion
and
the
first
circuit
opinion
in
this
respect
is
that
nobody
discusses
what
they
mean
by
such
terms
as
appreciate,
benefits,
competent,
or
capability.
and
it
is
quite
one
thing
to
say
that
a
patient
is
able
to
understand
that
there
may
be
risks
to
medication
and
to
understand
that
he
has
been
told
he
will
get
better
if
he
is
given
the
medication,
and
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
a
seriously
mentally
ill
patient
can
appreciate
the
benefits
of
being
well
when
by
definition
part
of
his
illness
is
that
he
doesn't
understand
that
what
he
is
is
not
well,
and
let
me
make
the
commonwealth's
position
clear
here.
we
are
not
stating
that
a
petition
of
commitment
is
the
same
as
a
legal
finding
of
incompetency.
we
recognize
that
people
may
be
delusional
in
some
aspects,
but
clearheaded
in
other
aspects
of
their
life.
mr.
stephen
schultz
at
a
commitment
there
must
be
a
finding
of
mental
illness,
there
must
be
a
finding
of
a
serious
risk
of
harm
to
an
individual
by
reason
of
mental
illness.
serious
risk
of
harm
is
defined
as
three
types
of
patients,
danger
to
others,
danger
to
yourself,
or
incapability
of
taking
care
of
yourself.
let's
look
at
those
three
kinds
of
patients.
you
talk
about
the
kind
of
patient
who
is
a
serious
risk
to
himself.
this
patient
by
definition,
if
he
is
going
to
be
committed,
is
seriously
depressed,
his
affect
is
impaired,
he
feels
that
there
is
really...
he
doesn't
understand
that
there
is
a
better
world.
he
feels
usually
that
the
only
way
out
is
by
killing
himself.
now,
certainly,
this
patient
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
understand
the
benefits
of
what
it
means
to
be
well,
because
in
his
world
the
whole
world
is
bleak.
look
at
the
second
kind
of
patient.
the
second
kind
of
patient
is
a
patient
who
is
a
danger
to
others.
this
person
by
definition
has
basically...
has
a
distorted
view
of
interpersonal
relations
with
somebody.
classically,
he
is
either
in
a
state
of
rage
or
he
is
in
a
state
of
panic,
a
rage
at
somebody
or
a
panic
that
somebody
else
is
going
to
hurt
him.
yes,
the
rage
and
the
panic
may
wax
and
wane
on
a
given
day
or
in
a
given
period,
but
the
basic
underlying
problem
of
his
illness
is
that
he
doesn't
understand
that
his
rage
or
panic
is
unreasonable,
and
there
is
no
way
that
patient
can
weigh
the
benefits
of
what
the
medication
is
going
to
be--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--what
the
court
of
appeals
does
is
require...
they
say
that
the
fact
of
violence
at
the
time
of
commitment
is
not
enough
to
later
forcibly
medicate
the
person
in
the
hospital.
they
say
that
dangerous
on
the
outside
may
not
mean
dangerousness
on
the
inside.
and
they
set
up
this
arbitrary
distinction
of,
you
can
forcibly
medicate
some
people
if
you
think
they
are
violent,
and
forcibly
medicate
other
people
if
what
you
want
is
treatment.
what
the
commonwealth
says
is,
everybody
is
committed
for
treatment.
it
is
simply
not
accurate
to
say
that
there
is
anybody
in
massachusetts
hospitals
because
they
are
dangerous.
that
is
not
why
they
are
there.
they
are
there
because
they
are
dangerous
by
reason
of
mental
illness.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
schultz
no,
absolutely
not.
under
the
first
standard...
it
is
more
than
that.
they
require
that
they
go
to
a
court
to
get
a
finding
of
incompetence,
and
the
question
is,
why--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--that's
right.
this
is
the
first
circuit
and
the
district
court.
they
say
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
to
treat
the
patient,
that
in
your
mind
treatment
may
be
necessary,
unless
you
can
find
these
exceptions
that
you
gave,
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
to
a
court
for
a
finding
of
competence,
and--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
schultz
medical
judgment.
mr.
stephen
schultz
what
they
were
all
involuntarily
committed
for
was
appropriate
treatment,
we
would
suggest.
we
would
suggest--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--well,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways,
if
i
can,
and
i
think
i
can
deal
with
the
questions
you're
raising.
this
case
is
not
a
procedural
case,
is
my
first
answer.
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
are
simply
talking
about
the
first
circuit
setting
up
additional
procedural
safeguards.
the
first
circuit
is
talking
about
changing
the
substance
of
law,
of
setting
up
a
different
class
of
patients
within
the
hospital,
a
group
which,
procedures
aside,
is
going
to
be
called
your
mentally
ill
competent
patient,
who
is
allowed
to
stay
in
the
hospital,
as
the
defense
puts
it,
demand
hotel
service
instead
of
treatment,
and
refuse
their
medication.
they
are
talking
about
another
group
of
patients
that
is
going
to
be
set
up
that
just
didn't
exist
before,
which
is
a
group
called
incompetent
patients
but
for
whom
there
is
going
to
be
a
substituted
judgment
that
if
they
were
competent
they
should
be
allowed
to
refuse,
and
those
patients
are
going...
somebody
else
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
say,
they
should
be
allowed
to
refuse
their
medication.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
setting
up...
this
is
not
the
procedural
question.
the
first
circuit
opinion
doesn't
even
mention
procedural
due
process.
this
isn't
an
opinion
which
talks
about
the
state's
rights
and
the
individual
rights
and
the
need
to
have
some
type
of
mechanism
which
will
lead
to
an
accurate
assessment,
which
we
would
suggest
in
our
brief
the
hospitals
do
have,
which
is
the
second
half.
we
believe
the
type
of
review
that
takes
place
at
these
hospitals
is
constitutionally
adequate,
but
what
i
want--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--at
these
hospitals,
there
are
rounds
every
day
in
which
medications
are
discussed,
at
which
a
doctor
must
be
present.
mr.
stephen
schultz
at
team
meetings
twice
a
week,
it
is
discussed
with
the
patient.
at
one
of
the
units
at
the
team
meetings,
the
medical
supervisor
attended
the
team
meetings.
mr.
stephen
schultz
the
record
shows
that
they
are.
that
that
was
always
a
factor.
that
they
would
listen
to
the
reasons
that
the
patients
gave
as
one
factor
they
would
take
into
account.
mr.
stephen
schultz
before,
not...
not
really.
i
mean,
dangerousness
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
mental
illness.
yes,
they
considered
it
to
the
extent
that
because
these
people
are
mentally
ill,
because
some
of
them
certainly
have
a
history
of
dangerousness,
that
these
patients
need
treatment,
but
i
cannot
honestly
say
that
dangerousness
was
one
of
the
factors
that
they
took
into
account.
what
they
took
into
account
was
whether
or
not
these
particular
patients
needed
the
antipsychotic
medication.
mr.
stephen
schultz
there
is
not
an
alternative
form
of
treatment
for
most
of
these
patients.
i
mean,
i
cannot
honestly
tell
you
that
they
went
through...
we
have
proposed
remedies
in
this
case,
where
the
other
side
suggests
under
the
doctrine
of
least
restrictive
alternative
there
are
12
other
alternatives
that
must
always
be
considered,
one
of
them
being
seclusion,
which
they
suggest
is
less
restrictive
than
forcible
medication.
the
doctors
did
not
do
that.
would
the
doctors
prescribe
antipsychotic
medication
if
they
didn't
believe
that
was
the
best
treatment?
no.
and
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
consideration
of
the
alternatives,
but
it
was
not
a
matter
that
they
said
to
themselves,
which
is
the
least
restrictive
form
of
treatment
that
could
be
given.
instead,
what
they
would
say
to
themselves
is,
what
is
the
best
form
of
treatment
that
they
could
be
given.
let
me
go
back
on--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--well,
it
would
be
a
consideration
of,
one,
what
are
the
side
effects
this
patient
is
having,
are
the
side
effects
so
serious
that
we
should...
first
of
all,
one
of
the
units
had
specific
meetings
simply
where
the
patients
could
raise
complaints
about
the
medication.
now
it
is
the
full
purpose
of
the
meeting
every
week.
so
obviously
in
that
situation
they
consider
what
the
patient
complained
about.
mr.
stephen
schultz
need
it
for
treatment,
and
does
the
need
outweigh
whatever
side
effects
this
particular
patient
might
be
experiencing
at
this
time.
is
the
patient's
health
changed
sufficiently?
it
may
be
one
can
start
other
therapies
in
addition
to
medication.
these
were
teaching
hospitals,
both
of
these
hospitals
that
we
have
here.
so
there
were
residency
programs.
the
residents,
as
in
any
teaching
facility,
would
regularly
be
meeting
with
their
supervisors.
they
would
be
regularly
meeting
with
the
patients.
and
these
are
hospitals
that
had
a
lot
of
feedback,
that
had
a
lot
of
periodic
review
of
the
various
medications.
one
other
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
that
i
think
both
courts
below
simply
have
misinterpreted
what
parens
patriae
power
and
what
police
powers
are
all
about.
police
power
is
talked
about
in
terms
of
a
policeman's
ability
to
prevent
dangerousness,
and
the
defendant
suggests
that
simply
is
not
what
the
police
power
is.
the
police
power,
according
to
past
cases
in
this
court,
is
the
ability
to
protect
the
general
welfare,
including
to
protect
the
public
health
of
its
citizens.
the
commonwealth
would
suggest
that
this
ability
to
protect
the
public
health
is
clearly
implicated
when
you
are
talking
about
the
need
to
treat
patients
against
their
will
who
have
already
been
committed
against
their
will
for
treatment
purposes.
as
to
the
parens
patriae
power,
i
simply
want
to
say
that
this
notion
of
competency
seems
to
have
been
invented
by
the
first
circuit
to
justify
its
opinion.
you
will
find
nothing
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
that
tie
this
variable
competency
that
can
change
in
one
day,
where
one
day
you
are
competent
and
one
day
you
are
not
competent,
to
the
parens
patriae
power.
the
state
is
the
sovereign,
as
a
sovereign
is
the
guardian
over
all
idiots
and
lunatics,
according
to
the
opinions
of
this
court.
this
court
has
never
mentioned
incompetency.
this
notion
of
incompetency,
the
commonwealth
would
suggest,
is
one
that
has
been
brought
in
from
the
rear
to
justify
the
opinion.
it
simply
is
not
necessary.
the
parens
patriae
powers
and
the
police
powers
are
more
than
adequate
to
justify
the
actions
taken
by
the
doctors
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
stephen
schultz
it
shows
that
they
were
half
of
what
you
might
find
in
a
private
hospital,
where
they
were
compared
to
mclean
hospital
in
boston
for
the
comparison
in
staffing.
they
were
far
above
the
minimum
standards
that
were
set
out
in
such
cases
as
wyatt.
mr.
stephen
schultz
the
staffing
could
have
been
better,
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
there
were
not
doctors,
there
were
not
good
registered
nurses,
there
were
not
residents.
i
mean,
that
kind
of
staffing
was
there.
mr.
stephen
schultz
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
of
trial
and
74...
i
guess
72
trial
days
and
two
days
of
closing
argument.
mr.
stephen
schultz
no,
i
think
that
is
certainly
there,
and
i
think
that
goes
to
this
problem
of
the
inability
to
predict
the
violence
of
some
patients,
the
unawareness
that
people
who
do
not
think
rationally
are
going
to
act
impulsively
on
those
irrational
thoughts.
there
is
simply
no
recognition
by
either
judge
of
those
particular
problems.
mr.
stephen
schultz
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
there
are
certainly
many
patients
you
cannot
do
that
for.
there
are
some
patients
that
might
have
a
clear
history
that
if
they
do
something,
they
do
something
first.
then
you
know
that
something
else
almost
always
follows.
then
you
have
a
history
showing
you
for
those
psychotic
patients
that
when
they
start
winding
up
you
have
got
to
look
out,
the
next
thing
they
are
going
to
do
is
punch
somebody.
but
if
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
history,
certainly
you
have
that
problem.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that's
correct.
there
is
an
affirmative
obligation
on
the
superintendent
to
release
a
patient
who
is
no
longer
mentally
ill
or
felt
no
longer
mentally
ill
and
dangerous.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
a
six-month
periodic
review
and
then
another
six-month
periodic
review
at
the
beginning,
then
they
are
yearly
after
the
first
six
months,
and
in
addition,
there
is
what
is
known
as
a
section
9
petition,
where
any
time
the
patient
himself
wants
to
petition
the
court,
he
can
do
so.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that
is
correct.
i
mean,
what
they
say,
without,
we
suggest,
any
real
support,
is
that
once
you
are
in
the
institution,
they
say
the
finding
is
dangerousness
on
the
outside,
not
necessarily
what
is
on
the
inside.
we
say
the
finding
is
dangerous
because
of
mental
illness,
and
that
they
are
just
missing
the
point
of
what
the
mental
illness
does
to
the
individual.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
schultz
all
massachusetts
law
says
is
that
you
are
competent
to
do
some
very
specific
things,
write
a
will,
manage
your
affairs.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that's
right.
it
says
nothing
about
that
you
are
competent
to
make
treatment
decisions.
that
is
gloss
that
the
first
circuit
and
the
district
court
opinion
have
put
on
the
massachusetts
law.
mr.
stephen
schultz
yes,
they
can.
but
again,
this
goes
to...
we
accept
that
somebody
may
be
delusional
in
some
areas
and
not
delusional
in
other
areas.
mr.
stephen
schultz
i
don't
think
it
should
be.
i
don't
think...
one,
competency
is
relevant,
as
i
have
discussed,
competency
is
a
variable
thing,
so
that
you
can
be
more
competent
one
day
than
the
next
day,
and
really
what
is
relevant
is
why
you
are
committed.
beyond
that,
massachusetts
law,
i
think,
is
clear.
it
does
not
recognize
a
right
to
refuse
treatment.
it
sets
out
in
the
law
specifically
that
there
is
a
right
to
refuse
electric
shock
and
lobotomy,
and
does
not
mention
antipsychotic
medication.
i
think
under
normal
rules
of
statutory
interpretation
the
right
interpretation
of
massachusetts
law
is
that
it
does
not
recognize
the
right
to
refuse
treatment
with
antipsychotic
medication.
mr.
stephen
schultz
they
did
not
before
this
suit
except
to
the
extent
that
for
the
voluntary
patient
they
would
say,
you
can
leave,
but
if
they
didn't,
then
they
treated
them
like
involuntary
patients,
without
bothering
to
commit.
mr.
stephen
schultz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
schultz
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
schultz
well,
i
have
certainly
responded
by
brief.
mr.
stephen
schultz
well,
i
can
do
no
more
than
really
repeat
what
i
think
are
the
basic
points
in
our
brief,
so
i
will
do
that
very
briefly,
if
you
would
like.
i
think
the
roe
decision,
first
of
all,
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
say
that
they
weren't
deciding
this
case.
on
four
different
occasions
they
said,
we
are
not--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--okay.
mr.
stephen
schultz
it
is
hard
to
say,
because
the
roe
decision
deals
with
a
moot
situation
which
is
never
going
to
come
up
again,
and
i
really
don't
think
the
roe
decision
is
going
to
have
any
impact
whatsoever
in
massachusetts.
mr.
stephen
schultz
absolutely.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
schultz
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
significance
of
the
roe
case,
because
there
simply
is
none,
and
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
that
this
case
should
not
be
vacated
and
should
not
be
certified.
in
roe,
the
court--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--excuse
me?
no,
it
should
not
be
affirmed
either,
in
our
view.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
started
today
by
saying
there
were
two
fundamental
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
issue
is,
what
does
it
mean
when
you
are
committed
for
treatment.
does
that
necessarily
act
as
a
sufficient
predicate
for
the
later
treatment
against
a
person's
will.
i
said
the
second
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is,
what
is
the
effect
on
the
hospital
of
allowing
some
patients
to
remain
in
the
hospital
refusing
treatment?
well,
roe
simply
didn't
say,
we
are
not
discussing
institutionalized
patients.
they
specifically
said
one
thing
we
are
not
going
to
discuss
is
what
is
the
effect
and
what
does
it
mean
that
you
have
already
had
a
commitment
hearing,
and
what
does
that
allow
the
state
to
do?
that
was
my
first
fundamental
issue
that
they
say
in
a
footnote,
we
are
not
discussing.
the
second
fundamental
issue
is,
they
say
the
one
thing
we
are
not
going
to
discuss
is,
what
is
the
effect
on
the
institution
if
you
allow
people
to
refuse
treatment?
certification
makes
absolutely
no
sense
for
answering
these
kinds
of
questions.
there
is
no
way--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--massachusetts
law
is
constitutional
law,
is
all
i
can
tell
you.
the
roe
decision--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
schultz
roe
turns
on
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
stephen
schultz
excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
schultz
in
our
opinion,
yes.
they
say--
mr.
stephen
schultz
--on
the...
i
believe
they
hit
the
right
to
privacy,
and
i
don't
know
if
they
tied
it
to
the
ninth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
roe,
they
said
there
are
three
factors
that
they
are
deciding
that
case
on.
they
said,
on
the
constitution,
on
the
power
over
guardians.
now,
certainly
that
is
not
relevant
in
this
case,
because
we
are
discussing
whether
or
not
a
guardian
has
to
be
appointed
in
the
first
place.
and
then
they
said,
on
the
common
law,
and
quoted
one
new
york
case
for
the
common
law
talking
about
what
are
basic
liberty
interests,
which
is
the
exact
same
question
you
would
ask
as
to
what
constitutionally
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
basic
liberty
interest.
roe
is
a
constitutional
case.
roe
doesn't
decide
on
any
statutes
or
on
any
massachusetts
regulations.
it
is
a
constitutional
case
which
is
reviewable
by
this
court,
which
didn't
have
the
record
that
this
court
has
to
decide
what
is
the
effect
on
an
institution
of
allowing
patients
to
refuse
treatment.
if
one
were
to
certify,
one
would
have
to
send
down
the
entire
74-day
record,
and
have
the
sjc
look
at
that
record
to
decide
what
the
effect
on
institutions
would
be.
mr.
stephen
schultz
absolutely.
they
say
it
four
times,
and
why...
the
other
side
is
saying
it
is
definitive,
but
if
a
court
ever
went...
they
are
right,
we
intervened
in
roe,
and
what
did
the
commonwealth
do
when
they
intervened
in
roe?
we
said,
don't
interfere
with
this
case.
this
case...
roe
does
not
involve
institutionalized
patients,
and
i
wrote
half
of
my
brief
saying
don't
interfere
with
this
case.
and
they
bought
it.
four
times
in
their
opinions,
they
say,
we
are
not
interfering
with
the
rogers
case.
and
i
just
don't
know
how
it
could
be
any
clearer
under
the
circumstances.
i
briefly
want
to
mention
just,
i
think,
a
very
basic
issue
that
justice
o'connor
raised,
and
that
is,
how
many
states
determine
incompetency
at
the
time
of
commitment?
according
to
the
psychiatric
brief,
they
state
one,
and
i
will
take
it
as
true.
utah.
and
what
the
commonwealth
asks
is,
if
you
have
to
determine
competency
to
treat
a
person
against
his
will,
why
can
you
commit
that
person
against
his
will
for
treatment
without
that
same
determination
of
incompetency?
and
what
is
really
being
challenged
in
this
case
is
the
commitments
in
those
49
states,
because
those
people
were
not
committed
for
dangerousness.
you
can't
commit
anybody
because
he
is
dangerous.
that
is
preventive
detention.
they
were
committed
because
they
were
dangerous
by
reason
of
mental
illness,
which
the
mental
illness
means
they
are
either
subject
to
care
or
treatment.
we
don't
necessarily
say
everybody
is
treatable,
but
we
are
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
they
are
treatable,
that
that
is
why
they
were
committed.
dangerous
by
reason
of
mental
illness.
not
dangerousness.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
talk
about
police
power
commitments,
to
say
that
the
state's
interest
is
satisfied
when
they
are
taken
off
the
street.
the
state's
interest
is
not
taking
people
off
the
street.
the
state
cannot
go
around
saying,
you
are
dangerous,
you
are
dangerous,
you
are
dangerous,
you
should
go
off
the
street.
they
have
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
massachusetts
that
they
are
dangerous
by
reason
of
mental
illness,
or
that
they
are
incapable
of
taking
care
of
themselves
by
reason
of
mental
illness.
the
state
can't
send
somebody
to
a
mental
hospital
simply
because
they
are
incapable
of
taking
care
of
themselves.
i
think
the
parens
patriae
power
might
let
them
send
them
some
place
else,
but
why
are
they
sent
to
a
mental
hospital?
because
they
are
mentally
ill,
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
fundamental
