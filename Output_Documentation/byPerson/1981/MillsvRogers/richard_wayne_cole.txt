mr.
richard
wayne
cole
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
try
to
clear
up
two
comments
that
were
made
at
the
end
of
the
argument
in
terms
of
commitment.
the
roe
case
specifically
dealt
with
whether
or
not
merely
because
someone
is
being
committed
for
dangerous
in
the
community,
dangerousness
in
the
community,
whether
it
means
that
a
person
would
be
necessarily
dangerous
in
the
hospital,
the
supreme
judicial
court
said
specifically
it
does
not
mean,
and
i
will
give
an
example
of
that.
someone
may
be
dangerous
to
their
family
because
hey
are
having
problems
with
their
family,
and
they
are
dangerous,
and
they
are
put
in
the
hospital.
now,
they
cannot
be
discharged,
because
if
they
are
again
discharged
into
the
community,
they
would
be
dangerous
in
the
community,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
would
be
dangerous
in
the
hospital.
in
fact,
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
based
on
the
evidence
presented
by
the
defendants,
that
only
25
percent
of
the
patients
in
the
hospital
are
in
fact
potentially
dangerous,
and
i
will
address
that
later.
second
of
all,
in
terms
of
the
practice
dealing
with
voluntary
patients,
they
were
treated
specifically
like
involuntary
patients.
what
happened
was
that
patients
weren't
told
that
they
had
a
right
to
leave.
they
were
told
that
if
they
refused
their
drugs,
they
would
be
forcibly
medicated,
and
that
if
they
tried
to
leave,
they
threatened
them
with
commitment.
so
there
wasn't
such
a
thing
that...
they
are
called
conditional
voluntary
patients,
where
the
patient
has
to
give
three
day
notice
to
the
hospital,
and
during
that
period
of
time
the
hospital
has
the
right
to
petition,
and
the
record
was
consistent
in
the
patients
who
testified
and
staff
who
testified
that
patients
were
threatened
that
if
they
did
refuse
and
they
tried
to
leave,
that
they
would
attempt
to
commit
them.
i
would
like
now
to
go
to
certain
brief
points
concerning
this
case.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
concerning
that.
most
patients,
at
least
the
testimony
that
we
have
from
staff
and
patients
was
that
the
patient
would
not
sign
the
voluntary...
or
withdraw
the
voluntary
under
the
threat
of
commitment.
but
there
was
no
record
concerning
what
was
the
rate
of
those
individuals
who
refused
and
whether
or
not
they
would
be
committed.
first
of
all.
i
would
like
to
make
the
point
that
respondent
in
this
case
had
never
sought
to
restrict
the
use
of
antipsychotic
drugs
on
individuals
who
were
able
to
weigh
the
risks
and
benefits
of
these
drugs
and
who
voluntarily
agreed
to
take
them.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
the
district
court
found,
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
presented
below,
that
most
patients
in
the
hospital
as
a
matter
of
fact
were
able
to
weigh
the
risks
and
benefits
of
the
drugs,
specifically
and
particularly
those
patients
who
had
experienced
antipsychotic
drugs
before.
now,
85
percent
of
the
patient
population
were
either
patients
who
were
chronic
patients
or
patients
who
had
been
rehospitalized
previously,
and
one
can
assume
by
both
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
as
petitioner
says
that
almost
all
those
patients
had
antipsychotic
drug
experience
in
the
past.
secondly,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
if
patients
are
provided
with
the
right
to
refuse
antipsychotic
drugs,
that
many
patients
will
be
without
treatment.
now,
the
petitioners
have
here
asked
for
de
novo
review
of
a
number
of
facts
found
by
the
district
court
after
a
72-day
trial,
a
voluminous
record
with
testimony
which...
some
of
it
was
in
dispute,
but
which
the
district
court
found...
but
the
district
court
found,
and
based
on...
by
statements
made
by
the
defendants
themselves,
that
the
vast
majority
of
patients
after
the
district
court
order
accepted
some
form
of
antipsychotic
drug,
though
not
necessarily
the
drug
or
dosage
the
doctors
originally
prescribed,
as
long
as
the
doctors
tried
to
use
discourse
to
discuss
with
the
patient
the
risks
and
benefits
rather
than
the
previous
practice
of
using
force
on
the
patients.
now,
this
was
a
different
practice,
and
the
defendants
admitted,
there
are
admissions
in
the
record
that
the
defendants'
practice
in
the
past
was
for
patients,
some
patients
who
were
able
to
make
rational
decisions,
that
they
would
ignore
or
disregard
patients'
complaints
about
the
adverse
side
effects,
and
medicate
them
anyway
because
the
doctors
believed
that
it
was
in
their
best
medical
interest.
secondly,
the
district
court
found
that
a
number
of
effective
alternatives
are
available
to
the
hospital
for
those
competent
patients
who
refuse
antipsychotic
drugs.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
your
honor,
there
was
substantial
testimony
from
a
number
of
national
experts
on
both
sides
concerning
alternatives--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case
is,
we
perceive
as
a
fundamental
historic
right
in
our
society
that
an
individual,
a
competent
adult
individual
has
a
right
to
refuse
treatment
recommended
to
them
by
a
doctor,
even
if
they--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
roe
case,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
the
highest
state
court,
specifically
said
that
patients
are
competent
to
make
treatment
decisions
even
though
committed,
so
in
their
interpretation
of
state
law--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--no,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe
that
all
of
them
are,
but
as
the
roe
case
said,
and
as
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
for
those
patients
who
are
unable
to
weigh
the
risks
and
benefits,
there
is
a
state
procedure
present,
and
in
fact,
the
petitioners
followed
that
same
state
procedure
for
medical
treatment
for
those
same
patients,
the
surgical
treatment
for
those
same
patients,
and
for
psychosurgery
and
electroshock.
that
means
that
if...
that
they
either
have
to
get
the
consent
of
those
same
patients
who
are
in
the
hospital
who
they
say
they
don't
have
to
get
for
antipsychotic
drug
treatment,
and
if
they
believe
they
are
incompetent,
that
they
have
to
go
to
the
probate
court
to
get
an
adjudication
of
legal
incompetency
before
they
can
be
forcibly
treated
for
medical
treatment,
surgical
treatment,
electroshock
and
psychosurgery,
and
this
treatment
could
be
ongoing
also.
for
example,
medical
treatment
could
for
the
same
patient
be
ongoing
and
involves
drugs
also,
the
drug,
for
example,
dilantin,
phenobarbital,
dealing
with
seizures.
they
are
ongoing.
and
they
need
the
consent
of
the
patient
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
your
honor,
the
answer
is,
each
type
of
situation
for
competency
to
vote,
for
contracting,
are
all
individual
legal
determinations
that
are
made
by
courts
of
law
in
massachusetts
traditionally.
in
fact,
dealing
with--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--there
is
a
belief
in...
there
is
law
that
in
massachusetts
someone
can
be
specifically
incompetent
in
one
area
and
not
legally
incompetent
in
another
area.
but
in
terms
of
medical
treatment,
procedure
follows
the
state
case
that
we
cited
in
court
dealing
with
lane
versus
candura,
where
a
doctor
believed
that
a
patient
who
was
going
to...
refused
surgery,
and
the
doctor
believed
the
patient
was
incompetent,
and
they
went
to
court,
and
the
court
says,
even
though
the
doctor
believed
that
the
decision
by
the
patient
was
unwise
and
foolish,
and
maybe
even
incompetent,
that
in
fact
she
was
still
legally
competent
under
massachusetts
law.
and
the
roe--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--i
think
the
massachusetts
law,
though,
it
is
not
clear,
is
that
if
a
person
understands
and
is
able
to
weigh
the
benefits
and
risks
of
the
type
of
treatment,
even
though--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--our
society
believes
that
an
individual
has
a
fundamental
liberty
interest
in
making
certain
decisions
except
for
in
certain
extraordinary
situations.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
the
finding
is
only
that
the
person
is
mentally
ill
and
dangerous
if
the
person
remains
in
the
community,
but
there
is
not
a
finding
that
the
person
is
mentally
ill
and
dangerous
in
general.
that
means
it
will
follow
the
person.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
the
third
category.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
the
inability
to
care
for
themselves
in
terms
of
the
basic
necessities
of
life.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
correct
in
terms
of
the
use
of
drugs
for
treatment
for
parens
patriae
circumstances.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
okay.
in
that
situation,
the
court
of
appeals
directly
addresses
that
circumstance.
in
a
situation
where
a
person...
and
the
respondents
have
always
conceded
this...
that
even
if
a
person
is
competent
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
threat
to
the
institution,
that
there
are
institutional
needs
that
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration,
and
in
that
circumstance
the
individual's
fundamental
liberty
interest
can
be
overridden.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
under
the...
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
is
that
because
a
patient
is
not
necessarily
dangerous
in
the
institution,
in
fact,
in
terms
of
violence,
there
are
only,
according
to
the
petitioner's
testimony,
approximately
25
percent
had
the
potential
for
violence,
that
all
the
doctor
has
to
do
is,
if
the
doctor
makes
an
individualized
assessment...
that
is
all
we
are
asking...
that
that
particular
patient
creates
a
danger
to
self
or
others
at
that
time,
then
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
overriding
the
competent
individual's
right
to
refuse.
and
so
that
is
correct
the
fact
is,
if
that
was
the
issue,
and
all
they
had
to
do
was
that,
the
petitioner
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
we
wouldn't
either,
because
that
would
end
the--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that's
right.
the
fact
is
there
are
a
large
percentage
of
patients
who
do
not
fit
into
that
category.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that's
correct.
an
example,
as
i
said,
was
an
individual
who
may
have
shown
violence
to
his
family,
and
has
a
pathology
with
his
family,
but
you
separate
them
from
the
family,
and
they
are
in
the
environment
of
the
hospital,
they
are
not
dangerous
to
anyone
else,
their
danger
was
specific.
they
were
dangerous
to
the
family
themselves.
and
they
can't
discharge
them
because
that
danger
continues
if
they
are
released,
and
society
has
decided...
i
mean,
the
patient
didn't
ask
to
be
there
in
the
first
place.
society
has
decided
that
they
have
an
interest,
a
police
power
interest
in
taking
that
individual
off
the
street.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
if
i
can
first
begin
to
answer
by
saying
that
the
first
thing
we
take
is
that
these
drugs
are
extremely
dangerous
drugs.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
these
are
not
relatively
risk-free
drugs.
and
what
we
are
saying
is,
in
an
individual
who
is
not
dangerous,
that
means,
the
doctor
does
not
believe
there
is
a
potential
for
harm
in
the
institution,
number
one,
and
who
is
not
causing
the
kind
of
security
problems
which
belong
to
the
police
power--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--then
he
is
only
giving
it
in
order
to
what
they
believe
to
benefit
the
individual,
to
have
them
improve
their
health
in
the
institution,
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
state--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that's
right.
that
is
particularly
important
in
this
case,
because
we
are
not
talking
about
relatively
risk-free
drugs.
we
are
talking
about
a
drug
which
the
district
court
found
that
30
to
50
percent
of
the
patients
are
getting
a
syndrome
called
tardive
dyskinesia,
which
is
the
deforming,
often
irreversible
and
untreatable
symptom
that
causes
patients
to
have
facial
contortions
and
grimaces,
to
have
lip-smacking
and
tongue
protrusions
that
can't
be
controlled
by
the
patient,
that
when
this
syndrome
gets
fully
manifested
patients
find
that
they
cannot
speak,
that...
and
speech
becomes
incomprehensible,
swallowing
and
breathing
are
impaired
as
well
as
all
motor
activity.
now,
if
this
was
only
1
or
2
or
3
percent
of
the
patient
population
involved--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that's
correct,
and
we
are
saying
that...
we
are
not
saying
this
for
all
treatment.
we
are
saying
that
there
are
particular
types
of
treatment,
such
as
psychosurgery,
electroshock,
that
raise
such
fundamental
interests
in
terms
of
what
these
drugs
can
do.
the
petitioners
say
these
drugs
don't
affect
the
mind.
well,
the
district
court
found...
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
this
case...
that
these
drugs
can
blunt
the
consciousness,
impair
cognition,
learning
ability,
problem-solving
ability.
mr.
cole,
none
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
suffered
any
of
these
effects,
did
they?
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
there
were
admissions
given...
the
distinction
that
is
being
drawn
is
between
the
main
plaintiffs
and
the
class
of
patients,
where
there
was
substantial
evidence
dealing
with
both,
and
there
was
admissions
concerning
the
effects
of
these
drugs,
and
doctors
admitted
that
some
patients
had
from
these
drugs
in
the
class,
had
clouded
consciousness.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
no,
in
terms
of
tardive
dyskinesia,
which
is
the
side
effect,
the
only...
they
agree
that
many
patients
had
tardive
dyskinesia
in
admissions.
the
only
specific
evidence
they
had--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--there
was
no...
in
the--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--we
only
raised
it
for
one
named
plaintiff,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
on
one
ward,
the
testimony
they
had
in
specifics
of
one
ward
in
the
hospital
during
one
period
where
a
defense
witness,
a
doctor
who
worked
there,
testified
that
10
to
15
patients
out
of
70
to
75
patients
on
that
ward
had
clear
cases
of
tardive
dyskinesia.
that
is
a
20
percent
rate
of
patients
who
have
tardive
dyskinesia,
clear
cases.
we
are
not
talking
about
subtle
signs
of
tardive
dyskinesia.
the
testimony
was
clear
cases
of
tardive
dyskinesia.
so
that
there
was
evidence
for
the
district
court.
the
district
court
also
used
the
medical
literature
and
the
expert
testimony,
and
there
was
a
lot
of
national
experts
who
testified
about
what
is
the
general
rate
of
patients
who
are
getting
this
deforming,
disabling
syndrome,
and--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--no,
your
honor.
any
patient
who
gets
antipsychotic
drugs
is
at
risk.
the
problem
with
these...
i
mean,
one
of
the
problems
is,
not
only
do
the
drugs
cause
tardive
dyskinesia,
but
they
can
also
mask
the
development
of
the
syndrome,
that
means,
the
manifestations
of
the
syndrome,
initially,
so
often
by
the
time
the
doctor
finds
out,
even
using
the
best
medical
standards,
by
the
time
the
doctor
finds
out
that
the
patient
has
the
syndrome,
it
is
often
irreversible,
often
untreatable.
not
always,
but
often.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
if
there
is
bad
practices.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
what
we
are
saying
is,
is
that
the
patient
is
the
one
who
has
to
assume
the
risk
of
this
irreversible
side
effect,
and
a
competent
individual
should,
just
like
other
competent
adults
in
our
society--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
the
question
is
not
whether...
one
can
competently
say
that
20
to
50
percent
of
patients
over
the
long
term
who
are
taking
these
drugs
are
getting
tardive
dyskinesia.
that
is
a
risk
that
one
can
understand.
one
can't
selectively
say
that
this
particular
patient
is
going
to
get
it.
just
like
when
someone
has
an
operation
and
the
doctor
says
there
is
a
one
in
100
chance
of
death,
they
don't
know
if
specifically
that
one
person
is
going
to
be
the
person
who
is
going
to
die.
of
course,
that
person
wouldn't
take
the
therapy.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
the
record
reflects
that
within
three
months
of
antipsychotic
drug
treatment,
there
have
been
reports
that
patients
have
had
tardive
dyskinesia.
within
a
year
of
antipsychotic
drug
treatment,
the
patient
is
at
high
risk.
now,
you
have
to
remember
that
a
number
of
these
patients
have
been
on
antipsychotics
in
the
past.
we
are
not
talking
about
one
year
straight.
we
are
talking
about
one
year.
eighty-five
percent
of
the
patient
population
are
either
chronic
patients
or
patients
who
are
being
readmitted
to
the
hospital
who
have
had
prior
hospitalizations,
and
therefore
have
taken
antipsychotic
drugs,
so
the
risk
is
great
for
that
85
percent
immediately
if
they
have
had
any
history
of
antipsychotic
drugs.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that's
correct,
because
that
is
not
the
only
side
effect
that
a
patient
experiences.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
it
is
the
one
that
in
terms
of
permanent
affect
is
there,
but
there
are
a
number
of
other...
a
patient
can
experience
a
number
of
side
effects
that
last
the
course
of
being
on
antipsychotic
drug
treatment,
very
painful
syndromes,
disabling,
not
only
of
the
body
but
also
of
the
mind.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
tradition
in
our
society
has
been
a
competent
individual
has
the
right,
even
if
we
believe
it
is
wrong,
to
refuse
treatment
as
long
as...
and
in
this
situation
we
are
talking
about
extremely
dangerous
treatment,
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest
involved,
and
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
weigh
the
strong
patient's
interest
and
the
institutional
interest,
and
we
feel
that
the
weighing
was
responsible,
giving
due
deference
to
the
state
and
the
institutional
needs,
but
at
the
same
time
recognizing
dangers
of
these
drugs
and
the
important
patient's
interest
in
being
able
to
refuse,
especially
considering
that
we
are
really
talking
about
and
focusing
on
patients
who
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
says
are
competent
to
make
these
rational
treatment
decisions.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
no.
we
recognize
that
it
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
interest
when
it
is
the
state
that
initially
had
decided
on
putting
him
into
the
hospital
in
the
first
place.
and
that
interest,
for
example,
is
under
the
police
power
to
protect
society
in
general.
and
we
are
saying,
does
that
interest
standing
alone
for
competent
individuals
dealing
with
these
dangerous
drugs
outweigh
the
patient's
interest.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
your
honor,
the
evidence
demonstrated
that
the
vast
majority
of
patients
did
not
refuse
antipsychotic
drugs
over
the
long
term
when
the
doctors
responded
to
the
patients
complaints
about
adverse
side
effects,
maybe
changed
the
drug
or
the
dosage.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
i
assume
that
there
have
been
patients
who
have
been
released
because
they
have
gotten
better.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
no,
i
think
there
was...
we
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
these
drugs
have
some
efficacy.
we
challenge
the--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--enough
that
some
people
are
released.
that
is
correct.
but
the
question
is,
the
state
has
decided
to
commit
the
individuals,
and
has
the
interest...
and
their
interest
has
been
satisfied
by
committing
them.
in
a
committing
hearing--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--as
i
said,
we
concede
that
that
is
a
legitimate
state
interest,
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
that.
the
evidence
doesn't
bear
out
that--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
the
thing
is,
the
misperception
about
that
is
that
the
state
has
decided
to
put
the
person
in
the
hospital,
especially
under
the
police
power,
that
has
nothing
to
do--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--there
is
no
finding
nor
necessary
finding
in
a
commitment
court
to
find
whether
or
not
a
patient
has...
whether
or
not
treatment
is
available,
whether
or
not
treatment
will
be
effective.
if
you
take
a
look
at--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--so
patients
who
cannot
be
treated
at
all,
the
state
still
commits.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
if
the
person--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--if
the
doctors
in
their
medical
judgment
believed
that
that
person
is
no
longer
dangerous
in
the
community,
they
can--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--the
response
is,
they
can't
release
them,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
police--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
they
would
probably
have
to
go
to
the
committing
court
to
ask
for
permission,
but
let
me--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--no,
absolutely
not.
let
me
just
mention
that
the
individual
who
is
wreaking
havoc
on
the
institution,
the
police
power
standing
of
the
first
circuit
takes
care
of
that
individual.
if
the
risk
of
institutional
security,
if
the
doctor
believes
that
it
is
affecting
other
patients,
significantly
deteriorating
other
patients,
then
the
hospital
can
do
that
if
there
are
no
other
alternatives.
they
can--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
they
can
use
medication
to
deal
with
that
situation.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
if
the
doctor
in
good
faith
and
honestly
complies
with
the
standard,
they
can
make
a
mistake
and
still
not
be
held
liable.
in
the
situation
of
this
case--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
a
risk.
however,
an
example
of
this
situation
was
in
our
case,
where
the
court,
district
court
found
the
defendants
violated
the
state
seclusion
statute,
and
knew
or
should
have
known
that
they
violated
it,
but
they
were
not
held
liable
because
the
court
said
they
couldn't
have
anticipated
that
they
violated
the
statute,
and
even
though
they
made
a
mistake,
the
court
found
that
they
were
not
liable.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
situation...
whatever
standard
we
are
going
to
use,
whether
or
not...
if
we
are
going
to
use
a
standard
of
that
doctors
can
only
treat
when
they
think
it
is
necessary,
the
doctors
can
be
sued
by
patients
if
the
patient
believes
it
is
not
necessary.
that
is
always
the
risk.
whatever
the
standard,
as
long
as
they
act
in
good
faith,
even
if
they
are
mistaken,
they
can't
be
held
liable.
now,
massachusetts,
dealing
with
malpractice,
has
a
malpractice
tribunal
to
deal
with
frivolous
complaints
and
to
screen
them
out,
but--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--our
belief
is
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
except
in
circumstances
where
the
institutional
security
or--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that's
correct.
in
fact,
that
is
the
procedure
that
the
defendants...
the
petitioners
use
in
a
situation--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--in
situations
of
electroshock
and
psychosurgery.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
you
are
asking
whether
or
not
the
patients
in
the
hospital--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--yes,
that
is
the
law
of
massachusetts.
the
secowitz
case,
which
dealt
with
an
institutionalized
mentally
retarded
individual,
was
specifically
that
case.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
it
includes
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
use
extraordinary...
in
that
case,
it
was
a
situation
where
whether
or
not
the
patient
could
refuse
treatment
that
may
extend
their
life
a
year,
maybe
two
years,
that
they
had
a
right
to
refuse
that
kind
of
treatment.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
our
view
is
that
this
court
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
issue
because
there
is
a
state
procedure
that
is
available
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
roe
says
that
that
is
the
procedure
to
follow
in
that
situation.
our
view
is
that
this
court
should
apply
the
state
procedure
dealing
with
that.
in
terms
of
what
we
believe
is
constitutionally
due,
our
view
is
that
competency
is
a
legal
determination.
it
has
been
in
every
context
in
our
society,
including
medical
care.
it
has
been
in
massachusetts,
certainly,
both
in
the
secowitz
case,
lane
versus
candura,
and
the
other
cases
we
have
cited,
has
always
been
a
legal
determination.
number
one,
we
believe
that
even
if
state
law
didn't
apply
and
require
a
competency
proceeding,
that
constitutionally
an
individual
would
be
required
to
have
it,
and
once
again,
it
emphasized
the
defendants
follow
that
procedure
for
medical,
surgical
treatment,
electroshock,
and
psychosurgery.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
i
don't
believe--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--i
believe
the
american
psychiatric
association
tries
to
indicate...
indicates
in
its
brief
that
there
are
certain
states...
i
don't
think
there
are
a
lot
of
states
that
have
that
finding,
and
they
recognize
that
massachusetts
is
not
one
of
those
states
that
actually
have
that
finding
in
their
brief.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
no,
your
honor.
that
is
an
emergency
situation,
and
the
attorney
general
of
massachusetts
wrote
an
advisory
opinion
to
the
department
of
mental
health
and
said
that
surgery
of
individuals
who
are
committed,
that
except
for
cases
of
an
emergency,
that
you
must
get
the
consent
of
the
individual
in
order
to
treat,
so
that
would
be
just
like
we
are
saying,
that
there
are
emergency
exceptions
to
the
rule,
but
that
the
general
rule
is
that
when
there
is
not
that
kind
of
an
emergency,
that
the
competent
individual--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--the
district
court
didn't
give
a
number.
what
the
district
court
said
was
that
most
patients
who
are
involuntarily
committed
are
competent
to
make
that...
to
weigh
the
risks
and
benefits.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
i
don't
believe
there
was...
there
was
medical
articles
dealing
with
comparing
patients
who
were
on
antipsychotic
drugs
versus
not
using
antipsychotic
drugs.
but
there
wasn't
any
percentage
of
the
number
of
patients--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that's
correct.
there
was
testimony
concerning
the
rate
of
improvement
with
antipsychotic
drugs
and
without,
dealing
generally,
not
dealing
with
the
particular
wards
here,
in
general,
and
it
was...
for
example,
the
chief
of
pharmacology
of
the
department
of
mental
health
testified
that
at
most,
50
percent
of
schizophrenic
patients
benefit
from
antipsychotic
drugs,
benefit,
improve
at
all.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
improve
at
all.
and
in
our
brief
we
indicate
what
the
different
kinds
of...
what
improvement
means,
and
that
improving
could
be
limited
to
the
extent
that
someone
may
at
that
point
be
able
to
cloth
himself.
that
is
considered
improvement,
but
as
this
doctor
said,
who
was
the
chief
psychopharmacologist,
that
approximately
50
percent
of
patients
with
schizophrenia
improve
at
all
on
antipsychotic
drugs.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
there
was
testimony
concerning
that,
your
honor,
that
even
though
someone
may
improve,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
would
be
released
necessarily.
improve
in
the
limited
sense
that
they
would
be
released.
approximately
50
percent
of
the
patients
in
this
hospital
were
long-term
patients,
were
long-term
chronic
patients.
that
was
testified
by
one
of
the...
dr.
gill,
i
believe,
that
approximately
50
percent
were
long-term
patients.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
no.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
i
think
we
are
talking
about
a
balancing
test
that
this
court
has
used
with
institutions,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
situations
which
deal
with
conditions
of
confinement,
that
there
is
a
different
test
than
dealing
with
fundamental
intrusions.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
used
as
non-punishment,
but
that
involve
fundamental
liberty
interests.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--no.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
it
is
the
significance
of
the
intrusion.
i
am
not
saying
that
with
a
flu
shot...
the
fact
is,
the
petitioners
say
that
someone
with
a
flu
shot
has
the
right
to
refuse
in
the
hospital,
so
they
do
have
that.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
i
think
that
would
be
termed
a
condition
of
confinement,
where
as
long
as
there
was
a
rational
reason
for
the
state
to
do
that,
that...
what
i
am
trying
to
distinguish
between
those...
there
is
a
balancing
test
in
an
institutional
setting,
and
that
when
a
treatment
crosses
the
line,
electroshock,
psychosurgery,
maybe
antipsychotic
drugs,
cross
that
line--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--crosses
a
line
in
terms
of
raising
a
fundamental
liberty,
a
fundamental
liberty
interest.
and
our
view
is
that
wherever
the
line
is
going
to
be
drawn
in
the
future--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--the
question
is,
it
is
a
fundamental
liberty.
the
question
is,
does
the
state
have
the
ability
to
override
that
in
an
institutional
setting.
that...
the
analysis
is,
our
view
is
that
in
a
situation
where
it
is
so
intrusive
that
the
state
in
many
situations
doesn't
have
the
legitimate
interest
to
overcome
that
general
right,
we
are
saying
there
are
certain
other
situations
where
the
state
may
have
that
interest,
but
that
is
not
as
significant
an
intrusion
as
we
have
with
antipsychotic
drugs.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
in
the
matter
of
guardianship
of
richard
roe
iii.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
our
view
is
that
it
disposes
of
this
case
under
state
law.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
because
the
court
attempted
to
analyze...
it
is
hard
to
say
briefly.
under
parens
patriae
the
court
said
that
the
state
does
not
have
a
parens
patriae
justification
for
forcibly
drugging--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
without
an
incompetency
determination.
second
of
all,
dealing
with--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that
is
correct.
and
secondly,
in
terms
of
the
police
power,
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
said
is,
when
drugs
are
used
to
protect
safety,
they
are
being
used
as
a
chemical
restraint.
the
massachusetts
legislature
and
the
department
of
mental
health
have
their
regulations
dealing
with
drugs
when
they
are
using
restraints,
when
they
are
used
for
restraints.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
yes,
we
did.
we
filed
a
motion
to--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--to
either--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--to
either
dismiss
it
or
certify
the
questions
to
the
supreme
judicial
court--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--exactly.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
before
we
do
that--
0
[generallaughter.]
before
we
do
that,
i
would
say
that
i
think
it
is
important
that
patients--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--well,
i
think
that
there
is
sufficient
uncertainty
about
the
police
power
situation,
and
the
problem
is,
the
case
said,
it
was
talking
about
institutionalized.
it
talked
specifically
about
the
rogers
case
for
institutionalized.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
our
view
is
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
certify
certain
questions
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
we
feel
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy,
this
case
has
been
going
on
for
seven
years.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that's
right.
the
court
has
in
the
past.
we--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--that's
correct.
because
we
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy,
it
would
be
faster,
so
we
don't
have
to
come
back
up
if
in
fact
there
is
any
issue
left
open.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
and
you
won't
have
to
travel

mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that's
correct,
though
it
did
discuss
the
rights
of
institutionalized
in
the
context
of
that
decision,
and
that
is
the
confusion
that
is
part
of
the
case,
and
while...
we
felt
that
it
could
be
certified
questions
to
the
judicial
supreme
court
and
get
clarity
about
which
way...
whether
or
not
those...
the
state
law
applies.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
we
believe
that
massachusetts
has
a
system
to
deal
with
this
situation
after
roe.
now,
prior
to
roe
there
wasn't
any
clarity
about
what
the
rights
were,
and
the
fact
is
that
both
parties
here
intervened
in
roe
and
were
a
party
in
roe.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
a
motion
to
either
dismiss
or
to
certify
questions
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
to
clarify
these
issues.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
no,
we
believe
that
you
could...
we
still
hold
to
that.
my
understanding
is
that
it
has
been
denied.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
well,
as
i
said,
i--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--we
would...
what
we
would
ask
for
is
this
court
to
certify--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--i--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--i
suppose...
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
what
we
are
interested
in
is
more
certification.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
i
would
say
that
it
is
too
confusing
to
know
whether
or
not
it
is
moot
at
this
time.
seriously,
it
is
based
on
the
supreme
judicial
court
opinion.
what
we
would
have
to
do
then--
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
--we
don't
know.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
wayne
cole
we
withdraw
that
part
of
the
motion,
your
honor,
i
suppose,
and
ask
that
the
questions
be
certified.
thank
you.
