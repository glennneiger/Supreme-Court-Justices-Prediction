mr.
donald
c.
walker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
just
to
say
a
few
things
on
the
facts
of
this
case
which
i
think
have
been
stepped
over
a
little
lightly.
on
the
prosecuting
witness,
the
defense
counsel
of
the
trial
had
shown
certain
bias
on
the
prosecuting
witness,
and
then
on
redirect
the
deputy
district
attorney
tried
to
rehabilitate
the
state
witness.
the
attorney...
mr.
attorney
general
stated
that
the
deputy
da
was
goaded
into
it.
now,
there
was
a
recess
the
day
of
the
trial,
so
the
deputy
district
attorney
had
all
evening,
and
the
testimony
is
that
she
met
the
witness
in
the
hall
and
discussed
it,
found
out...
it
came
out
in
the
facts
of
the
case
that
the
prosecuting
witness
did
not
know
the
defendant,
had
never
done
business
with
him,
and
they
like
to
go
over
the
fact
that
it
was
a
seven-word
question.
it
was
a
commenting
statement
more
than
a
question,
and
then
it
goes
more
to
an
objection
as
to
the
proprieties
of
a
question
on
hearsay
or
the
fact
that
the
question
could
have
been
asked
another
way.
she
knew
that
she
had
no
basic
testimony
to
extract
from
the
prosecuting
witness,
and
went
ahead
anyway.
so,
i
think
that
it
is
more
than
a
technical
breach.
the
district
attorney
should
be
able
to
go
maybe
a
lifetime
without
making
such,
i
think,
an
overreaching
and
flagrant
statement.
now,
one
thing,
too,
that
should
be
pointed
out,
that
when
this
happened,
the
trial
judge
did
not
even
seek
argument.
he
said,
granted.
so,
i
mean,
i
think
we
have
to
take
in
the
circumstances,
the
surrounding
circumstances
more
than
just
the
written
word
that
was
taken
down
in
the
transcript.
there
was
no
question,
and
then
where
the
trial
judge
says,
well,
you
went
over
the
line,
it
was
overreaching.
one
other
thing
that
i
think
is
important
to
know
here
is
the
history
of
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
gillette.
judge
gillette
had
this
case
before
him,
and
before
that
was
the
rathbun
case,
which
is
cited
in
his
opinion.
the
rathbun
case
was
the
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
bailiff.
when
that
case
came
up,
judge
gillette
is
the
one
that
heard
that
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
held
that
it
was
more
like
jury
bias
rather
than
overreaching
or
that
sort
of
thing,
and
so
he
overruled
the
trial
court.
that
went
up
to
the
oregon
supreme
court,
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
overruled
judge
gillette.
so,
when
judge
gillette
in
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
then
has
the
kennedy
case,
he
has
the
latest
decision
in
oregon
stating
that
a
bailiff's
misconduct,
and
that
is
the
rationale
of
the
case,
where...
is
abhorrent,
is
the
case
that
was
used
in
that
decision.
so,
if
the
rationale
and
the
bailiff's
subjective
intent
was
not
important,
so
judge
gillette
had
that
precedent.
so
he
followed
that
case.
i
disagree
that
he
was
following
his
own
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
well,
i
think,
regardless
of
how
he
says
that,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
the
oregon
rule
and
the
rationale,
i
think
he
might
have
been
trying
to
show
some
face-saving
interest
in
his
own
court
of
appeals
decision,
but
the
thing
that
is
interesting
in
the
kennedy
decision
by
judge
gillette
is
that
he
cites
as
dictum
u.s.
jorn
and
dinitz,
but
then
he
says,
the
court,
oregon,
or
state
versus
rathbun,
287
oregon,
so
what
is
in
the
court?
the
only
case
that
is
really
in
point
is
state
versus
rathbun,
and
the
oregon
rule
is
that
an
officer
of
the
court,
a
bailiff,
misconduct
that
goes
to
that
point
where
it
did
is
flagrant
and
is
overreaching.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
definitely.
i
think
that
the
bottom
line
is,
what
is
the
oregon
rule,
and
the
oregon
rule
is
the
supreme
court
rule
of
state
versus
rathbun,
and
that
is
what
he
was
following,
i
think,
in
that
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
question
about
this
case
being
before
this
court.
first
is
that
i
think
the
oregon
kennedy
case
is
not
ambiguous,
and
i
think
it
is
founded
on
state
law,
because
when
you
say
a
court,
that
is...
i
looked
it
up
in
black's
law
dictionary.
it
says
that,
as
a
judge
would
say,
i
concur,
i
accord,
and
therefore,
i
think
we
are...
we
look
back
then
to
state
versus
rathbun.
it
definitely
states,
we
are
not
deciding
this,
we
are
not
going
to
speculate
what
the
united
states
supreme
court
will
do.
we
are
deciding
this
on
oregon
constitutional
grounds,
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
rationale
of
state
versus
rathbun,
which
was,
i
think,
adopted
in
state
versus
kennedy.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
yes.
true.
i
think--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--you
can't
ignore
that,
but
i
think
that
when
the
state
judge
is
trying
to
uphold
a
constitutional
guarantee,
he
has
to
be
concerned
with
what
is
the
state
law
that
is
involved,
and
then
he
can't
ignore
the
federal
law,
but
the...
so
he
has
to
reconcile
both.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
well,
i
think
that's
the
correct
procedure,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be...
perhaps
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
he
had
done
that.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
that's
true.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
that's
right,
and
he
had
a--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--that's
right,
and
i
think
probably
that
that
message
will
get
through
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
that
that
might
make
the
job
for
everyone--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--yes,
i
think--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--the
state
versus
cupp,
which
i
think
is
a
recent
case
in
290
oregon...
it's
in
one
of
the
briefs...
why
states,
first
you
look
to
the
oregon
law,
and
if
you
look
to
the
oregon
law
and
decide
it
on
the
oregon
constitution,
that's
the
first
analysis,
and
that's
one,
and
if
you
follow
your
state
constitution--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--well,
i
think,
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
my
second
point
is
at
most
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
ambiguous,
and
if
it
is
ambiguous,
then
it
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
clarification,
but
i
think,
though,
that
sometimes,
you
know,
when
things
move--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--by
all
means.
and--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--that's
right.
and
i
think
that
restraint
should
be
exercised,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
state
courts
should
be
more
innovative,
and
i
think
they
should
exercise
that
responsibility.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
no,
i
don't
mean...
no.
i
think
that
they
should...
i
think
that
due
process,
part
of
due
process
is
following
your
own
state
constitution,
and
since
the
defendant
kennedy
has
basic
rights
under
the
oregon
constitution,
and
neither
of
the
counsel
here
have
suggested
the
fact
that
maybe
his
state
due
process
rights
haven't
been
taken
care
of
by
their
argument.
i
would
say
this,
and
my
third
point
on
the
question...
my
first
point
being,
i
think
that
when
it
says
the
court...
state
versus
rathbun,
i
think
that's
the
case
that's...
that
jorn
and
dinitz
don't
really
take
care
of
kennedy.
the
dictum
is
referable
all
right,
but
state
versus
rathbun
is
right
on
point.
if
a
bailiff
is
a
court
officer,
certainly
a
deputy
district
attorney
is
a
court
officer,
and
that
case,
i
would
say,
was
practically
on
all
fours.
but
the
third
point
that
even
though
this
court
thought
it
was
not
ambiguous
and
it
was
decided
on
federal
law,
it
still
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
oregon
to
accept
the
responsibility
of
deciding
their
own
law
first,
as
justice
lindy
has
stated,
and
then
make
that
decision,
but
in
that
process,
then,
the
state
of
oregon
would...
certainly
the
scope
of
it
would
be
to
see
that
if
kennedy's
due
process
rights,
both
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
under
the
oregon
constitution,
were
protected,
and
it
is
not
enough
just
to
look
at
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
also
the
oregon
constitution.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i
say
that
even
if
it
is
based
on
that,
that
it
is
in
line
with
jorn
and
versus
dinitz,
and
in
substance,
it
is
the
basis
for
a
double
jeopardy
bar,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--well,
i
think
the
fact
that
in
the
second
prosecution
that
there
was
the
harassment,
there
was
threatened
multiple
trials,
and
bad
faith,
and
i
think
those
are
the
terms,
i
think,
used
both
in
jorn
and
dinitz,
and
they...
both
of
those
cases,
the
footnotes
refer
to
u.s.
versus
tateo,
that
the
converse
of
the
rule...
i
think
we
all
realize
that
we
are
on
the
exception
to
the
general
rule.
where
the
defendant
moves
for
a
mistrial,
usually
that
is
not
a
bar.
the
exception
being
is
what
is
discussed
in
jorn
and
dinitz,
and
both
footnotes
of
those
cases
refer
to
tateo.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i...
yes.
i
think...
i
think
that
it
is
implicit
in
that
statement,
that
commenting
question,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
end
result,
and
i
think
to
say,
and
to
put
the
prosecutor
on
the
stand
and
say,
well,
was
that
your
intent,
i
don't
think
that
is
practical.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
of
course,
then,
i
think
it
would
be
the
basis
for
reversal,
and
i
agree
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
bar,
but
there
is
one--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--no.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i
don't
agree
with
that,
and
i
think
that
counsel
have
been
shown
a
lack
of
faith
in
trial
judges,
and
they
say
that
the
term
"overreaching"
is
vague.
the
word
"manifest
necessity"
can
be
vague
also.
what
does
that
mean?
but
i
think
it
is
a
guideline,
it
is
a
tool,
and
i
think
it
was
in
jorn
where
the
court
has
said,
we've
declined
the
invitation
to
place
these
in
nice
little
categories
of
what
the
conduct
will
be.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--there
was...
i
think
the
language
that
we
are
not
going
to
use
the
bright
line
rule,
and
that...
in
other
words,
they...
it
would
be
pretty
difficult
for
this
court
to
make
certain
refinements
that
would
take
care
of
every
situation,
and
i
think
that
a
trial
judge
who
sees
the
method
of...
the
behavior
of
the
prosecuting
attorney,
maybe
the
raising
or
lowering
of
voice,
and
the
temperament
of
the
whole
situation,
is
in
that
position,
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
trial
judges
are
that
flimsy
in
their
decision-making
power.
there
comes
a
time,
you
take
in
the
perez
decision,
where
you
say
that
a
hung
jury,
that
is
the
basis
for
a
mistrial,
and
no
bar
to
reprosecution.
everybody
would
agree
with
that,
because
that
is
an
easy
example
of
the
manifest
necessity
rule.
but
what
if
you
had
a
ten-day
criminal
trial,
and
then
the
judge,
trial
judge
declared
a
mistrial
after
the
jury
had
been
out
an
hour
and
a
half,
for
no
really
apparent
reason.
i
think
the
defendant
would
certainly
jump
to
the
conclusion
and
jump
to
his
feet
after
that
say
that
would...
he
had
a
right
for
the
double
jeopardy
bar.
so,
any
rule
that
the
court
may
make
has
to
stand
eventually
on
its
own
two
feet,
in
common
sense
of
a
trial
judge,
and
this
trial
judge,
you
see,
there's
like
has
been
mentioned
here
before,
the
trial
judge
immediately
granted
the
mistrial.
then
another
trial
judge,
when
it
was
going
to
be
up
for
the
trial
the
second
time,
then
hears
the
statement
of
the
prosecutor,
and
i
would
say
in
answer
to
the
questions
of
the
finding
of
fact,
you
can
find
the
trial
judge
can
make
certain
findings
of
the
fact,
but
it's
the
constitutional
impact
or
the
consequences
of
those
facts
that
the
appellate
court
can
say,
well,
those
facts
warrant
this.
we're
not
changing
the
facts,
but
we're
saying
that
the
constitutional
consequences
of
those
facts
lead
us
to
this
legal
conclusion.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i
couldn't
agree
more,
and...
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
the
finding
of
facts
that
they
are
relying
on
is
a
second
trial
judge
who
was
different
than
the
first
one
who
granted
the
mistrial
just
spontaneously,
and
so
i
think
that
the
findings
by
the
second
trial
judge
is
one
thing,
but
when
the
appellate
judge,
judge
gillette,
says,
we
are
saying
that
in
spite
of
those
findings,
the
consequential
impact
of
those
findings
are
that
it
is
still
flagrant
overreaching,
and
remember,
he
had
state
versus
rathbun
right
before
him,
and
state
versus
rathbun
says
that
the
conduct
of
the
bailiff
was
abhorrent,
so
what...
now,
if
you
say
the
state
of
oregon
rule
is
that
the
bailiff's
conduct
is
abhorrent
by
talking
to
the
jurors,
i
think
there's
a
greater
duty
on
the
prosecuting
attorney,
and
so
then
he
comes
along
and
doesn't
use
the
word
"abhorrent"
but
i
think
it
is
synonymous,
"flagrant",
and
so
i
think
that
those
situations
are
very
similar.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i
think
that...
there
again,
i
think
that
decision-making
power
has
to
be
with
the
trial
judge.
you
know,
when
these
cases
come
up
and
no
trial
judge
probably
prepares
himself
basically
ahead
of
time,
maybe
it's
a
criminal
case
on
questions
of
search
and
seizures
and
all
that.
he
is
probably
not
thinking
about
double
jeopardy
and
a
mistrial.
so
then
somebody,
some
counsel
might
cite
him
this
case,
and
he
reads
it
over.
he
hasn't
read
it
maybe
over
in
depth
like
we
do
in
preparing
for
an
argument,
and
so
he
has
to
be
guided
by
certain
common
sense
guidelines.
the
term
"bad
faith",
"overreaching",
"manifest
necessity",
"deliberate
intent",
and
all
that.
it
would
be...
and
i
think
the
most
vague
one
and
the
most
difficult
is
the
word
"deliberate
intent".
i
think
"bad
faith"
and
"overreaching"
are
much
easier
to
arrive
at.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
well,
yes,
i
know,
but
if
it
is
hard
to
arrive
at,
justice
rehnquist,
and
this
is
subjective,
i
can't
imagine...
and
i
think
we
could
go
through
many,
many
cases,
and...
to
find
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
would
say,
yes,
that
was
my
deliberate
intention.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
well,
i
think
that
what
that
means
to
me,
justice
brennan,
is
that
you
have
to
take
the
objective
remarks
and
what
is
the
objective
conduct
of
the--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--well,
that's
right,
but
in
following
state
versus
rathbun,
state
versus
rathbun
just
before
this
case
on
the
conduct
of
the
bailiff,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
says,
we
can't
speculate
on
the
mind-reading
of
the
bailiff,
and
so
i
think
judge
gillette
had
that
in
mind
when
he
wrote
that.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
yes.
but
i
think
that
the
defendant
kennedy
is,
perhaps,
on
this
procedure
that
was
followed
in
oregon,
is
only
getting
half
a
loaf,
because
the
real
person
that
can
make
that
judgment
better
than
anybody
else
is
the
trial
judge
who
declared
the
mistrial,
and
he
said
granted,
right
away,
so
several
weeks
after
then
another
judge
who
hasn't
had
the
atmosphere
of
the
first
case
firsthand,
and
then
just
listens
to
the
prosecutor,
that
was
the
only
witness,
and
then
says,
well,
i
don't
find
any
deliberate
intent,
i
don't
think
that
takes
us
away
from
bad
faith
or
overreaching
or
even
the
deliberate
intent,
getting
back
to
the
subjectiveness
of
it.
in
the
first
place,
the
trial
judge
might
say,
i
don't
find
by
her
testimony
that
she
had
the
deliberate
intent.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i
think
it's
different
here
in
the
fact
that
we
have
two
different
trial
judges.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
that's
right.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--i
think
that
puts
trial
judges
down
a
little
bit.
i
don't
think
that
trial
judges
are
going
to
be
that
weak
in
making
decisions.
i
think
they
have
an
equal
responsibility
under
the
united
states
and
the
oregon
constitutions
to
say
when
a
person's
prize
guarantee
has
been
violated,
and
to
respond
to
the
question
of
the
trier
of
the
fact
might
decide
something,
we
know
all
types
of
situations
where
they
might
decide
a
fact,
and
it
might
require
gross
negligence.
well,
the
court
will
say,
in
spite
of
your
finding
that
is
a
fact,
as
a
legal
consequence,
that
is
not
gross
negligence.
so,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
constitutional
consequences
of
a
finding
of
fact
are
still
up
to
the
appellate
court
on
the
legal
consequences.
and
when
the
solicitor
general...
i
think
it
puts
a
heavy
burden
in
this
case
on
kennedy
to
use
this
case,
which
should
be
decided
on
oregon
law,
as
a
basis
for
reconciling
conflicts
maybe
in
the
various
circuits,
and
i'm
not
so
sure
there
is
that
much
conflict.
i
mean,
there's...
because
every
case
has
its
own
facts,
and
any
proposed
test,
we
are
still
going
to
set
down
to
somebody
can
say,
well,
that's
too
vague,
and
no
matter
what
you
do,
whether
you
say
bad
faith,
overreaching,
deliberate
intent,
whatever.
and
i
think
that
it
is
safer
to
leave
the
decision-making
to
where
you
have
a
common
sense
guideline,
and
i
think
jorn
and
dinitz
do
that.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i
think
that
would
be...
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think
it
might
be
a
100
percent
situation
where
that
the
appellate
court
couldn't
review
it
if
it
was
just
a
misconstruing
of
the
law
as
to
those...
what
he
said
was
deliberate
intent.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
i
think
most
likely.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
well,
i
think...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question
fully,
but
if--
mr.
donald
c.
walker
--well,
the
point
there,
i
think,
in
some
of
these
cases
that
involve
a
faulty
indictment,
i
don't
that
is
probably
embraced
in
your
question.
mr.
donald
c.
walker
well,
maybe
i
can
answer
it
this
way.
in
dinitz,
if
it
had
been
the
prosecutor
who
had
made
those
contemptuous
remarks
in
the
opening
statement,
and
then
was
admonished
by
the
trial
judge,
and
he
went
on,
and
the
trial
judge
finds
that
on
those
set
of
circumstances
there
was
deliberate
intent,
i
think
definitely
it
would
be
under
the
rule
that
would
be
a
bar
to
retrial.
but
getting
back
to,
i
think,
the...
so
in
substance
i
still
think
that
the
oregon
court
is
not
out
of
line
with
jorn
or
dinitz,
but
getting
back,
i
think,
to
a
very
fundamental
proposition
on
the
case
being...
or
this
case
should
be
disposed
of,
first,
that...
i
don't
think
you
can
ignore
a
court
in
state
versus
rathbun
and
its
opinion,
and
certainly
what
does
that
mean?
it
isn't
meaningless,
and
you
can't
find...
and
that
case
is
on
point.
but
even
if
it
is
ambiguous,
then
we
reverse
and
remand.
but
on
the
cases
that...
and
this
court
has...
in
herb
versus
pitcairn
and
other
cases,
i
think
that
the
oregon
court
certainly,
if
it
went
back
to
the
oregon
court,
i
think
judge
gillette
would
end
up
with
the
same
decision,
and
then
if
it
went
to
the
oregon
supreme
court,
the
oregon
supreme
court
is
going
to
follow
the
rule
of
state
versus
rathbun,
and
follow
justice
lindy's
statements
and
policy
that
we
first
look
to
our
own,
and
we
cited
the
oregon
constitution
in
our
briefs
originally
in
the
appellate...
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
i
think
that
kennedy
is
entitled
to
due
process,
which
includes
an
analysis
of
the
oregon
law,
first
by
the
oregon
court
in
that
sequence.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
why,
i
have
tried
to
cover
the
waterfront.
