mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
state
of
oregon
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
prevent
retrial
of
the
defendant
after
a
mistrial
is
declared
at
his
request
or
with
his
consent,
provided
only
that
the
prosecution
did
not
deliberately
provoke
the
mistrial
request
or
the
defendant's
consent.
in
the
federal
system,
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
now
adhere
to
that
rule.
however,
some
have
held
or
stated
that
reprosecution
may
be
barred
where
the
mistrial
request
is
caused
by
prosecutorial
overreaching
or
gross
negligence
or
bad
faith
or
intentional
misconduct.
in
the
brief
time
allotted
to
me
this
morning,
i
will
attempt
to
show
that
none
of
these
alternative
standards
is
workable,
and
that
all
would
produce
highly
undesirable
practical
consequences.
first,
all
these
terms
are
simply
too
vague
to
provide
any
real
guidance
to
courts
or
litigants.
overreaching,
for
example,
is
simply
a
conclusory
term.
it
means
conduct
that
reaches
or
goes
too
far.
it
is
not
a
question
of
fact.
since
it
means
conduct
that
reaches
or
goes
too
far,
virtually
all
prosecutorial
or
judicial
error
that
causes
a
mistrial
would
appear
to
constitute
overreaching,
because
by
definition
it
is
conduct
that
went
too
far.
it
caused
the
mistrial.
gross
negligence
is
an
equally
vague
standard.
this
court's
decision
in
lee
in
1977
stands
for
the
proposition
that
simple
negligence
on
the
part
of
a
prosecutor
or
a
judge
is
not
sufficient
to
bar
retrial,
and
no
one
has
ever
adequately
explained
the
distinction
between
gross
negligence
and
simple
negligence.
in
the
field
of
torts
from
which
that
term
was
borrowed,
the
concept
has
now
been
generally
repudiated.
the
terms
bad
faith
and
intentional
misconduct
have
similar
flaws.
apparently
these
terms
refer
to
any
conduct
that
is
not
inadvertent,
and
that
the
prosecutor
or
judge
knows
is
wrong
or
improper.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
in
that
case
the
remedy
would
be
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--or
if
a
mistrial
was
not
declared,
reversal
on
appeal.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
under
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
he
might,
if
he
took
some
action
that
irreparably
prejudiced
the
defendant's
ability
to
obtain
a
fair
trial.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
remedy
there
is
simply
a
mistrial
reversal
of
a
conviction.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
right.
the
defendant
has
a
valued
right
to
have
his
trial
completed
by
a
particular
tribunal,
but
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
he
has
no
right
to
a
single
errorless
trial
or
even
a
single
trial
that
is
free
of
highly
prejudicial
reversible
error.
that
proposition
was
effectively
settled
more
than
80
years
ago,
when
this
court
held
in
ball
that
a
retrial
was
permitted
following
reversal
of
conviction
on
appeal,
and
there
are
sound
reasons
for
that
rule.
it
would
simply
be
impossible
as
a
practical
matter
to
guarantee
criminal
defendants
a
single
errorless
proceeding.
criminal
trials
are
simply
too
complicated.
too
many
things
can
go
wrong.
things
happen
spontaneously
and
unexpectedly.
prosecutors
and
judges
are
required
to
say
and
do
many
things
without
the
opportunity
for
leisurely
reflection,
and
requiring
a
single...
requiring
the--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--certainly.
if
she
deliberately
intended
to
provoke
a
mistrial,
then
double
jeopardy
would
have
barred
reprosecution,
but
the
trial
level
court
found
that
she
did
not
have
such
an
intent,
and
that
has
not
been
disputed
by...
that
was
not
reversed
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes,
i
doubt
that
there
will
be
very
many
cases
in
which
a
prosecutor
will
admit
that
he
set
out
to
cause
a
mistrial,
but
i
think
that
there
will
be
circumstantial
evidence
from
which
an
experienced
trial
judge
could
determine
without
great
difficulty
whether
the
prosecutor
deliberately
provoked
a
mistrial.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
as
i
understood
your
hypothetical.
justice
stevens,
there
the
prosecutor
did
not
have
the
intent
to
provoke
a
mistrial.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
if
the
judge
believed
him,
and
based
on
the
circumstantial
evidence,
how
was
the
case
going
for
the
prosecutor,
what
was
his
manner
when
he
made
the
fatal
error,
what
is
his
background,
what
was
his
reaction
to
the
defense
mistrial
request,
based
on
all
of
those
and
other
factors,
if
the
trial
judge
believed
that
he
lacked
the
intent
to
provoke
the
mistrial,
then
double
jeopardy
would
not
bar
reprosecution.
as
i
was
attempting
to
show,
these
alternative
standards
that
have
been
adopted
by
some
of
the
lower
federal
courts
and
by
some
state
courts
are
simply
too
vague
to
provide
any
real
guidance
to
courts
or
litigants.
they
will
produce
inconsistent
and
inequitable
results.
they
will
result
in
confusion
on
the
part
of
trial
judges
who
must
decide
whether
to
grant
defense
mistrial
requests.
because
those
judges
will
be
fearful
that
granting
a
request
will
bar
future
prosecution,
they
will
probably
be
more
reluctant
to
grant
defense
mistrial
requests,
and
that,
of
course,
will
work
to
the
disadvantage
of
defendants.
it
will
also
lead
them
to
be
more
inclined
than
they
are
at
present
to
permit
the
completion
of
tainted
proceedings,
knowing
that
a
reversal
on
appeal
would
not
bar
reprosecution,
and
that
would
result
in
more
appellate
reversals,
needless
appellate
litigation,
and
many
wasted
days
of
trial
while
tainted
proceedings
are
permitted
to
run
their
course.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
that's...
that's
absolutely
correct.
i
have
no
idea
what
overreaching
means.
it
is
simply
a
conclusory
term.
it
is
not
a
finding
of
fact
which
in
the
federal
system
would
be
governed
by
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
it
is
simply
a
conclusion
that
the
judge
draws,
and
i
would
venture
to
say
that
in
any
arguable
case,
there
are
many...
there
is
room
for
many
opinions
as
to
whether
the
conduct
at
issue
constituted
overreaching.
in
sum,
we
don't
think
that
any
of
these
alternative
standards
is
workable.
they
would
all
produce
highly
undesirable
practical
consequences,
and
we
therefore
respectfully
urge
that
the
judgement
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes.
we
think
that
is
the
finding
of
fact
that
wasn't
disturbed
and
decides
this
case
under
the
rule
that
we
advocate
and
that
this
court
has
adopted
repeatedly
at
least
in
dicta
in
recent
decisions.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think...
i
don't
believe
this
court
would
disturb
such
a
finding
made
by
a
trial
level
state
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
justice
marshal,
i
would
not
regard
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
that
the
prosecutor's
conduct
constituted
flagrant
overreaching
as
a
finding
of
fact.
that
was
simply
a
conclusion
that
the
court...
a
conclusion--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--no,
i
don't
believe
you
are.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
there
are
two
reasons.
one
is
a
finding
of
fact,
and
the
other
is
simply
a
conclusion
of
law.
one
was
made
by
a
trial
level
court,
and
the
other
was
made
by
an
appellate
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
but
the
trial
level
court
took
testimony
on
this
issue,
and
was
able
to
observe
the--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
trial
level
court
took
testimony
from,
i
believe,
from
the
prosecutor.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
she
didn't,
and
the
trial
level
judge
believed
her,
and
made
a
finding
of
fact
to
that
effect.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
powell.
it
said
under
oregon--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that's
correct.
thank
you.
