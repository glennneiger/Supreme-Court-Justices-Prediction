unknown
speaker
didn't
your
court
say
he
was
a
key
witness?
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
we
take
his
word
over
yours?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
general
frohnmayer,
the
hearing
on
the
double
jeopardy
issue
was
conducted
by
a
different
trial
judge
than
the
first
one.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
normal...
maybe
these
things
don't
arise
that
often,
but
was
that
pursuant
to
any
special
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
your
view
of
the
case
if
the
same
trial
judge,
the
judge
who
was
conducting
the
trial
had
conducted
the
hearing
on
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
and
you
had
exactly
the
same
record
at
the
original
trial,
and
the
same
testimony,
and
the
judge
said,
well,
my
impression
is
that
the
case
was
going
badly
for
the
prosecutor,
and
so
the
prosecutor
took
a
few
chances,
and
was
trying
to...
hoping
to
get
a
better
result,
so
although
there
was
not
a
subjective
intent
to
provoke
a
mistrial,
it
is
tantamount
to
that,
and
therefore
i
will
find
that
it
was
the
equivalent
of
an
intent
to
cause
a
mistrial,
and
that
is
unfair
to
the
defendant?
would
that
be
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
supposing
the
first
trial
judge
said,
i
understand
that
the
prosecutor
testified
she
didn't
intend
to,
but
i
really
don't
believe
her,
i
think
that
she
was
pretty
desperate,
she
wanted
a
second
chance,
and
so
i
will
find
on
the
very
facts
we
have
in
this
case
that
it
was
deliberately
done
to
provoke
a
new
trial.
then
i
take
it
there
would
be
double
jeopardy.
unknown
speaker
so
that
on
this
record
it
could
have
gone
either
way.
unknown
speaker
depending
on
what
the
trial
judge
found.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rule
on
that
point.
it
ruled
on
flagrant.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
and
said,
however,
this
case
of
flagrant
overreaching
lies
outside
that
rule.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
ruling
of
the
court?
it
is
the
last...
next
to
the
last
sentence.
unknown
speaker
flagrant?
do
you
agree
with
flagrant?
unknown
speaker
that
is...
your
court
used
that
word.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
stupid
would
have
been
a
better
characterization.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frohnmayer,
even
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
in
your
argument
here
today
as
far
as
the
federal
rule
is
concerned,
if
the
case
were
to
go
back
to
oregon,
would
oregon
apply
a
more
stringent
test,
as
has
been
suggested
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
so
that
under
the
oregon
constitution
and
under
oregon
law,
for
example,
in
the
rathbun
case,
is
a
stricter
standard
applied?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
cited
its
rathbun
decision,
meant
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
rathbun,
and
not
the
later
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
possibility
that
oregon
law
would
apply
a
different
standard
than
that
which
you
are
arguing
should
be
applied
by
us?
unknown
speaker
but
would
not
the
proper
disposition
be,
if
we
agreed
with
you,
to
send
it
back
to
that
court
to
be
sure
that
they
do
not
think
there
is
a
state
rule
that
adequately
supports
their
determination?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
so,
mr.
attorney
general,
if
we
were
to
reverse,
our
mandate
is
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion,
so
i
should
suppose
if
your
court
of
appeals
wanted
then
to
determine
a
state
constitutional
ground,
it
would
be
free
to
do
so
under
our
mandate,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
may
have,
but
we
have
no
choice
after
we
decide
the
federal
question,
if
we
do,
in
your
favor,
but
to
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
unknown
speaker
and
i
would
suppose
that
would
leave
your
court
of
appeals
open
to...
if
it
wants
to
change
its
mind,
to
apply
a
state
ground.
unknown
speaker
your
state
supreme
court
declined
to
review
this
case,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand,
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
law
of
oregon
gives
two
reasons
for
applying
double
jeopardy.
one,
the
trial
court
found
didn't
apply,
and
the
second
one
was
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on,
and
you
haven't...
i
mean,
aren't
we
to
give
deference
to
their
holding
that
this
was
overreaching?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
specifically
say
it
is
overreaching?
unknown
speaker
but
he
says,
this
is
a
case...
well,
do
you
deny
that
there
was
overreaching?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
law
of
oregon
that
overreaching
is
a
ground?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
law
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
their
finding
that...
you
admit
that
this
man
was
overreaching.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
do
you
agree
with
it,
that
it
is
overreaching,
end
of
quote?
unknown
speaker
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
case
to
test
your...
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
prosecutor
toward
the
end
of
his
case
knew
he
didn't
have
enough
evidence
to
convict,
but
he
had
had
an
interview
off
the
record
with
some
witness
that
was
not
admissible,
and
he
thought,
well,
the
only
possible
way...
i
know
justice
demands
that
we
convict
this
man...
would
be
to
get
this
evidence
before
the
jury,
so
he
deliberately
told
the
jury
about
some
inadmissible
evidence,
and
then
the
other
side
moves
for
a
mistrial.
would
that
be
permissible?
he
didn't
even
think
about
the
consequences
of
a
mistrial.
but
a
rather
flagrant
example.
unknown
speaker
and
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
could
he
do
anything
bad
enough
to
justify
a
final
determination
of
innocence
if
he
didn't
really
think
about
the
mistrial
problem
and
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
in
this
particular
trial.
he
just
did
everything
that
you
can
think
of
that
would
make
the
trial
unfair,
but
he
just
was
very
inexperienced
and
very
zealous
and
very
eager
to
get
justice
done
in
the
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
and
a
second
trial.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
granted
all
that,
maybe
you
don't
joint
the
attorney
general's
concession,
but
on
these
very
facts,
if
this
young
lady
had
deliberately
intended
to
get
a
mistrial
by
asking
that
question,
you
would
agree
that
then
there
would
be
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
how
does
one
prove
the
subjective
intent
of
the
prosecutor?
could
you
ever
do
it
if
the
prosecutor
denied
that
intent?
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
the
hypotheticals
i
gave
you.
that
wouldn't
be
adequate.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
got
on
the
stand
before
the
judge
and
said,
well,
i
just
didn't
think
about
this
consequence,
and
i
haven't
had
much
experience.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is
that
with
a
subjective
rule
that
almost
requires
psychoanalyzing
the
prosecutor,
the
safe
thing
for
a
trial
judge
to
do
is
simply
say,
let
it
go,
and
then
let
them
go
the
regular
appeal
route,
correct
the
error
on
appeal,
and
then
they
will
be
retried?
unknown
speaker
and
you
stand,
i
take
it,
on
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
found
and
the
reviewing
court
did
not
disturb
the
finding
that
there
was
no
invidious
or
improper
intent.
unknown
speaker
are
we
bound
by
that
finding,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
can
we
also
take
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we
bound
by
that
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
we
are
bound
by
one
and
the
other
is
what?
unknown
speaker
and
the
trial
level
is
above
the
appellate
level.
unknown
speaker
did
it
take
testimony?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
so
in
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
the
prosecutor
didn't
say
i
violated
the
laws.
unknown
speaker
i
understood
that
the
appellate
court
did
accept
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
that
there
was
no
intent
to
bring
about
a
mistrial.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
you
had
mentioned
that.
so
you
have
a
two-court
rule,
don't
you,
on
that
finding
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
correct,
mr.
walker,
why
does
he
cite
the
rathbun
case
first
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
then
simply
say
reversed
on
other
grounds,
and
cite
the
supreme
court
decision?
unknown
speaker
you
disagree,
then,
with
the
attorney
general
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
use
of
the
term
"reversed
on
other
grounds".
unknown
speaker
but
he
also
relies
on
jorn,
the
decision
by
this
court,
several
times.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
can't
ignore
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
if
the
oregon
law
is
tougher
on
the
prosecution
in
the
area
of
double
jeopardy,
he
would
first
go
to
oregon
law.
unknown
speaker
but
he
didn't.
he
cites,
as
justice
marshal
said,
jorn.
then
he
cites
dinitz.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
justice
lindy,
at
least,
of
your
supreme
court
write
opinions
all
the
time
encouraging
reliance
on
your
state
constitution
rather
than
on
the
federal
constitution,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
he
counsels
doing
it
very
explicitly,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
has
your
supreme
court
yet
told
the
court
of
appeals
that's
the
procedure
to
follow?
unknown
speaker
put
it
if
possible
on
the
state
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but
can
we
say
that
was
done
by
your
court
of
appeals
in
the
kennedy
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me,
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
and
think
this
is
on
a
federal
ground,
and
were
to
affirm
it,
or
reverse
it,
rather,
going
back
to
my
colloquy
with
the
attorney
general,
wouldn't
your
court
of
appeals
still
be
free
to
follow
justice
lindy's
counsel?
unknown
speaker
then
they
are
making,
in
that
case,
they
are
making
the
decision
on
their
own
responsibility.
they
are
accountable
to
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
voters,
if
you
have
an
elective
system
there.
unknown
speaker
by
innovative,
do
you
mean
ignore
the
opinions
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
now,
addressing...
if
you
will
agree
with
me
on
the
premise
that
this
does
rest
on
an
interpretation
of
federal
constitutional
law...
just
assume
that
with
me.
then
what
do
you
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
phrase
the
test
whether
or
not
the
mistrial
was
a
second
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
question
which
had
been
referred
to
and
described
somewhere
here
in
one
of
the
briefs
as
stupid,
that
that
question
was
a
deliberate
effort,
a
calculated
effort
to
provoke
a
mistrial.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
judge,
the
trial
judge,
now,
had
simply
said
that
to
the
jury,
that
remark
was
not
a
question,
it
was
a
remark,
it
was
wholly
unprofessional
and
out
of
line,
has
no
place,
and
you
will
disregard
it,
and
then
reprimand
the
prosecutor
in
open
court,
and
then
go
on
with
the
trial?
then,
if
a
conviction
had
occurred,
then
what?
unknown
speaker
then
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
let
the
trials
go
on--
unknown
speaker
--never
declare
a
mistrial.
unknown
speaker
was
that
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
jorn?
there
wasn't
a
court
opinion,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
court
opinion.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
trial
judge
who
has
been
watching
this
whole
proceeding
the
best
person
to
make
an
evaluation
of
whether
there
was
or
was
not
an
improper
intent
without
relying
on
what
the
prosecutor
claims
is
his
intent?
unknown
speaker
how
does
one
distinguish
between
flagrant
conduct
and
abhorrent
conduct,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
dinitz
characterized
the
prosecutor's
conduct
as
"improper"
conduct?
unknown
speaker
well,
"deliberate
intent"
certainly
isn't
imprecise.
it
may
be
hard
to
arrive
at.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
walker,
i
thought
this
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
footnote
1,
indicated
the
court
of
appeals
was
very...
had
real
reservations
about
subjective
intent.
"we
are
not
sure
that
the
subjective
intent
of
the
prosecutor
should
necessarily
play
a
pivotal
role
in
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
prior
jeopardy
forbids
retrial.
"
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
so
deliberate
intent,
to
the
extent
that
is
subjective,
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
thought
was
not
too
good
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walker,
even
if
subjective
intent
is
the
standard
to
which
we
address
ourselves,
the
trial
judge
can
make
the
determination
on
factors
other
than
the
prosecutor's
admission
of
intent.
isn't
that
true?
the
trial
judge
can
look
at
the
whole
circumstances,
and
regardless
of
what
the
prosecutor
says
was
intended,
make
that
determination.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact-finding
of
deliberate
intent
in
this
setting
is
not
different,
is
it,
from
the
fact-finding
that
the
triers
or
trier
must
make
on
the
intent
in
a
criminal
act,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
ever
object--
--never
mind
two
different
trial
judges.
let's
stay
on
the
one
question.
is
it
any
different
from
the
problem
of
finding
intent
which
judges
and
jurors
do
not
find
from
express
admissions,
they
find
it
from
a
series
of
objective
facts,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
then
decide
that
all
of
these
facts
taken
together
either
do
or
do
not
show
an
intent.
now,
i
notice
here
that
there
is,
in
one
of
the
opinions,
i
think
the
second
one
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there's
a
footnote
admonishing
judges
to
see
to
it
that
their
bailiffs
are
instructed
not
to
talk
to
jurors,
and
so
forth.
if
you
were
to
prevail
here,
perhaps
that
would
invoke
or
provoke
an
admonition
to
trial
judges,
in
view
of
this
fog
bank
of
meaning
on
the
difficulty
of
making
the
subjective
determination,
we
commend
to
trial
judges
the
idea
of
never
granting
a
mistrial,
let
it
go
to
its
determination,
and
let
it
be
corrected
if
error
on
appeal,
and
then
you
won't
have
a
double
jeopardy
question.
that
might
be
the
result,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
a
unanimous
opinion.
it
might
be
a
result
of
such
a
holding.
unknown
speaker
if
a
trial
judge
in
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
after
some
dubious
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
then
made
a
finding
that
this
was
deliberate
and
calculated
conduct,
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
that
would
be
the
equivalent
then
under
the
rule
you
propose
and
perhaps
the
rule
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
to
dismissing
the
indictment
with
prejudice,
would
it
not,
because
there
could
not
be
another
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the
judge
making
the
finding
that
this
was
deliberate
and
calculated,
inexcusable,
unprofessional
conduct,
whatever
terms
you
want
to
use,
then
said
on
that
basis,
in
light
of
the
decisions,
i
dismiss
the
indictment
with
prejudice.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
a
trial
judge
ought
to
do
that
if
he
knew
that
the
consequence
was
to
create
a
double
jeopardy
situation?
that
is,
bite
the
bullet,
and
take
the
ultimate
decision?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
is
saying
it
is
calculated,
deliberate
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
under
the
theory
you
advance
and
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
that
is
equivalent
to
saying
he
cannot
be
tried
again,
and
so
then
why
not
do
it
directly
and
openly,
and
say,
the
indictment
is
dismissed
with
prejudice
on
this
ground?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
just
conduct.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
that
is
the
test,
and
if
we
make
it
the
test,
every
prosecutor
presumably
would
know
that,
and
therefore
every
time
a
prosecutor
intended
to
abort
the
trial
in
that
way,
he
would
also
intend
to
acquit
the
defendant,
because
that
would
be
as
a
matter
of
law
the
consequence
that
would
follow,
isn't
it?
so
it
has
to
be
an
intent
to
acquit
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
so
it
would
have
to
be
a
secret
intent
by
definition,
because
if
he
did
it
overtly,
he
would
be
acquitting
the
man.
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
to
presume
the
situation
in
which
the
prosecutor
is
prepared
to
testify
falsely
that
this
was
not
his
real
intent.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
ultimate
inquiry
is,
what
did
he
really
intend
to
accomplish,
and
if
he
really
did
intend
to
accomplish
a
deliberate
mistrial,
and
if
he
presumably
knows
the
law,
he
then
was
intending
to
accomplish
an
acquittal.
it
is
a
very
strange
combination
of
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
sure.
something
sufficiently
prejudicial
could
have
happened.
you
don't
think
there
should
never
be
a
mistrial,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
take
the--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
agree
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
the
rathbun
case
expressly
rejected
the
notion
of
subjective
intent?
they
there
said
the
bailiff
intended
merely
to
help
get
a
conviction,
didn't
intend
at
all
to
get
a
hung
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
went
on.
i
happened
to
get
the
opinion.
"there
is
nothing
to
suggest
the
bailiff
sought
to
cause
a
mistrial.
"
"we
dare
say
that
nothing
was
further
from
her
mind
than
causing
a
hung
jury.
"
"on
the
contrary,
her
apparent
purpose
was
to
assist
the
state
in
securing
a
conviction.
"
and
then
they
say,
but
nevertheless
we
just
have
got
to
apply
an
objective
standard.
that
would
seem
to
be
the
rule
in
oregon.
you
don't
look
to
subjective
intent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
you
know,
seriously,
the
missing
witness
in
this
case
is
the
trial
judge,
and
i
want...
my
question
is,
suppose
the
hearing
was
held
before
him.
you
would
be
pretty
well
bound
by
his
ruling,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
you
didn't
have
a
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
didn't
make
this
decision.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
by
trial
judge,
i
am
talking
about
the
original
trial
judge.
i
think
we
have
to
explain
that.
