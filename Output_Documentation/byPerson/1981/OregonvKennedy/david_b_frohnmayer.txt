mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
oregon
court
of
appeals.
that
court
reversed
defendant's
theft
conviction
despite
the
fact
that
defendant's
earlier
trial
was
terminated
by
defendant's
own
successful
mistrial
motion.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
held
that
reprosecution
itself
was
barred
because
of
jeopardy
grounds
due
to
the
events
preceding
defendant's
successful
mistrial
motion
in
the
aborted
trial.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
convicted
thief
ought
to
be
able
to
escape
the
occasion
of
that
conviction
through
the
consequence
of
his
own
deliberate
trial
strategy.
the
relevant
facts,
we
believe,
are
few
and
simple.
early
in
defendant's
first
trial,
the
prosecution
asked
an
admittedly
improper
seven-word
question.
before
the
witness
answered,
defense
counsel
objected,
moved
for
a
mistrial,
and
asked
that
the
matter
be
reset
for
trial.
the
trial
court
granted
defendant's
motion
over
the
strenuous
objection
of
the
prosecution.
prior
to
his
retrial,
defendant
then
asked
a
different
judge
to
dismiss
the
case
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
the
trial
court
declined
to
do
so
after
making
explicit
findings
that
the
prosecutor's
conduct
was
not
intentional,
that
the
question
was
not
asked
in
bad
faith,
and
that
it
was
not
grossly
negligent.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
however,
reversed
defendant's
subsequent
conviction,
finding
that
there
was
nonetheless
a
fifth
amendment
jeopardy
bar
because
the
prosecutor's
question
constituted
something,
to
wit,
called
overreaching.
the
proposition
we
would
put
to
this
court
is
simple,
and
that
is
that
a
defendant
who
elects
to
move
for
a
mistrial
cannot
raise
a
jeopardy
bar
to
his
retrial
except
in
one
narrow
circumstance,
and
that
is
where
the
prosecutor's
conduct
itself
is
intended
to
provoke
that
very
mistrial,
and
we
note
at
the
outset
the
anomaly
that
under
the
settled
law
of
this
court,
had
defendant
merely
objected
to
the
question,
been
convicted,
and
then
secured
successful
reversal
upon
appeal,
he
could
be
retried.
so,
the
issue
is
whether
the
defendant,
by
himself,
shortcircuiting
the
trial
process
in
a
full
trial
on
the
merits,
can
be
allowed
to
achieve
a
different
result
because
his
well-taken
mistrial
motion
was
granted.
we
contend
that
the
defendant
cannot
create
these
anomalous
results
and
cannot
complain
except
in
the
narrow
circumstance
where
the
prosecutor
intends
that
the
trial
not
be
completed,
and
where
the
prosecutor's
conduct
was
intended
to
provoke
that
very
mistrial.
we
believe
that
our
proposed
test
would
assist
both
the
public
and
criminal
defendants,
and
we
believe
that
to
affirm
this
case
would
do
grave
injury
to
both.
an
affirmance
would
clog
court
calendars.
it
would
multiply
appeals
about
the
precise
degree
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
or
error
which
should
lead
under
a
blameworthiness
standard
of
some
kind
to
a
double
jeopardy
finding.
it
would
also,
we
believe,
deter
trial
judges
from
granting
mistrials
in
cases
where
they
are
appropriate,
because
they
would
know
for
certain
that
the
defendant
would
go
scot
free.
under
those
circumstances,
the
delay,
the
time,
the
anxiety,
the
multiplication
of
appeals,
and
the
cost
to
the
public
of
hearing
clearly
meritorious
appeals
would
be,
we
think,
a
prohibitively
high
cost
for
such
a
different
rule.
we
believe
that
the
rule
for
which
we
argue
is
compelled
by
an
understanding
of
the
history
and
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
that
it
is
implicit,
at
least,
in
the
dicta
and
holdings
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
a
draconian
sanction
of
barring
retrial
altogether
when
the
prosecution
makes
an
error
ignores
the
fact
that
there
exist
equally
effective
sanctions
against
prosecutorial
misconduct,
and
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
ease
and
certainty
of
application
of
our
rule
make
it
a
justifiable
and
appropriate
one.
we
note
at
the
outset,
of
course,
that
one
of
the
pieces
of
the
history
and
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
prevent
against
repeated
harassment
of
a
defendant
by
the
prosecution
when
the
prosecution
suddenly
realized
that
the
case
is
going
badly.
in
that
sense,
this
court
has
spoken
of
the
defendant's
valued
right
to
decision
by
a
first
tribunal.
on
the
other
hand,
we
can
find
no
decision
of
this
court
which
has
ever
found
that
the
double
jeopardy
bar
applies
where
a
mistrial
motion
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
is
granted
at
the
defendant's
request,
and
that,
we
believe
is
for
a
good
reason,
and
that
is
because,
as
this
court
has
explicitly
recognized,
in
lee
and
in
other
cases,
a
mistrial
declaration,
when
it
is
properly
made,
serves
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy.
it
is
a
deliberate
election
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
avoid
a
jury
verdict
which
it
is
his
right
to
achieve,
and
to
challenge
whatever
error
there
may
be
in
the
record
on
appeal.
at
the
same
time,
that
very
mistrial
motion
ordinarily
acts
as
sufficient
and
complete
punishment
for
whatever
prosecutorial
error
or
unfair
advantage
there
might
have
been,
and
of
course,
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
there
is
and
must
be
balanced
against
whatever
right
there
is
to
a
first
tribunal,
or
policy
there
is
in
favor
of
a
first
tribunal,
an
important
social
interest
in
the
completion
of
criminal
proceedings
against
a
defendant
once
and
for
all,
a
rationale
which
was
re-emphasized
as
recently
as
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
scott.
we
think
the
policies
that
lie
behind
this
and
behind
this
court's
earlier
dicta
on
the
question
make
an
enormous
amount
of
sense,
because
ordinarily
mistrial
is
itself
a
very
significant
sanction
against
the
prosecutor.
it
is
very
easy,
i
think,
to
envision
the
displeasure
of
the
prosecutor's
supervisor
and
the
public
at
the
expense
of
a
new
trial,
let
alone
the
fact
that
a
new
trial
probably
for
the
prosecution
will
be
more
difficult
to
carry
through.
however,
the
limited
exception
to
the
rule,
which
we
believe
is
implicit
in
this
court's
dicta,
at
least,
is
that
if
the
prosecutor
wishes
that
very
sanction
in
this
trial
to
be
imposed,
then
of
course
it
loses
its
character
as
a
sanction
for
misconduct,
and
under
those
circumstances,
a
more
serious
sanction
would
be
called
for,
because
if
it
is
not,
then
the
consequence
is
the
deliberate
harassment
of
the
defendant
within
the
central
meaning
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
itself.
in
this
case,
of
course,
none
of
the
factors
that
would
call
forth
that
rule
exist.
we
have
already
noted
that
under
the
facts,
the
error
of
the
prosecutor
occurred
early
in
the
trial.
two
perfunctory
witnesses
were
heard.
the
third
had
testified
not
to
essential
elements
of
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence,
but
was
merely
testifying
as
to
the
value
of
the
rug
that
was
in
question.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
there
is
no
question,
justice
marshal--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes,
you
certainly
may.
i
did
not
mean
to
intimate
that
any
witness
was
not
a
key
witness.
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
witness
was
not
testifying
directly
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant,
which
is
one
of
the
points
which
earlier
decisions
of
this
court,
i
believe,
place
special
emphasis
upon.
the
point
is
that
the
trial
judge
did
make
findings,
justice
marshal,
precisely
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
conduct
in
which
the
prosecutor
had
engaged.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
was
not
to
my
knowledge
pursuant
to
any
special
rule,
although
it
would
not
be
a
typical
for
oregon's
largest
county
for
a
different
judge
to
hear
the
motion
calendar
than
had
heard
the
case.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would.
it
would
go
mainly
to
the
issue
of
who
evaluates
the
record.
it
is
our
view
that
this
rule
should
give
appropriate
deference
to
the
trial
judge's
finding,
whether
it
is
a
different
judge
who
evaluates
the
first
conduct
or
the
one
who
was
there.
in
the
example
that
you
posit,
it
seems
perfectly
appropriate
that
the
judge
who
was
even
closer
to
the
actual
conduct
of
the
criminal
trial
and
therefore
who
might
be
able
to
judge
and
know
of
his
own
observation
of
the
nuances
of
defendant's
and
prosecutor's
demeanor
might
be
an
even
better
place
to
make
such
a
decision.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
of
course,
it
is,
and
we
believe
that
it
is
within
the
purview
of
the
trial
judge
to
evaluate
not
merely
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
the--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
findings
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
which,
justice
marshal--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
understand
that
that
is
in
fact
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
characterization
of
the
prosecution's
conduct
as
being
improper.
what
we
simply
state--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
a
characterization
that--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
that
is
a
characterization
of
the
court
of
appeals
by
which
i
assume
that
we
are
bound.
however,
it
does
differ,
i
must
say,
in
at
least
emphasis
or
epithet
from
that
which
was
given
to
it
by
the
trial
judge
whose
findings
the
court
of
appeals
accepted.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
we
come
to
this
court
with
no
apologies
for
the
prosecutor's
conduct,
and
i
hope
that
is
clear
to
this
court.
what
we
are
simply
saying
is
that
however
flagrant
the
conduct
may
be,
whatever
epithet
had
been
attached
to
it,
it
was
not
of
the
character
and
kind
which
this
court's
prior
decisions
and
dicta,
at
least,
quite
properly
indicate
should
be
the
occasion
for
finding
that
the
mistrial
motion
was
one
into
which
the
defendant
was
goaded
without
any
real
option
or
without
any
real
choice.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
i
am
glad
that
you
asked
the
question,
because
it
does
give
me
a
chance
to
point
out
that
the
amicus
brief
which
raises
the
rathbun
case
raises
the
wrong
rathbun
case.
it
refers
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
case
in
the
rathbun
case,
but
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
whose
decision
we
are
contending
today
is
erroneous
cited
deliberately
its
own
opinion,
and
pointed
out
that
the
supreme
court
rathbun
case
was
decided
on
other
grounds.
the
other
grounds
on
which
the
oregon
supreme
court
case
was
decided
were
in
fact
state
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind,
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
more
clearly
other
than
stating
it
explicitly
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
been
saying
that
it
was
deciding
the
case
on
federal
grounds,
because
it
cites
its
own
opinion,
says
that
the
other
opinion
is
reversed
on
other
grounds,
the
other
grounds
on
which
it
was
reversed
were
state
constitutional
grounds,
so
there
is
no
question
but
that
we
are
here
on
federal
grounds.
but
to
address
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
not
clear
what
the
rathbun
case
would
dictate,
because
at
the
time
the
supreme
court
decided
rathbun,
it
noted
that
there
was
no
state
or
federal
constitutional
authority
precisely
on
point
on
the
double
jeopardy
question
where
a
bailiff
attempts
improperly
to
influence
a
jury,
and
there
still
is
no
such
federal
case,
so
we
would
have
to
know
whether
or
not
this
court,
for
example,
would
extend
double
jeopardy
protections
to
a
defendant
where
a
bailiff
engaged
in
improper
conduct.
we
did
note
that
in
the
rathbun
case
decided--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes,
it
is
a
possibility,
and
what
we
represent
to
this
court,
however,
is
that
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
chose
deliberately
to
determine
the
case
on
federal
grounds,
apparently
believing,
since
the
state
constitutional
grounds
were
argued
to
it
at
least
in
the
briefs
of
both
defendant
and
state,
that
the
federal
ground
was
the
appropriate
and
dispositive
ground.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
i
don't
believe
so
at
all,
because
the
oregon
courts
know
when
they
wish
to
cite
a
state
ground.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
really
explicit
in
the
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
citing
other
cases.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
suppose
that
it
would,
except
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
explicit
in
our
judgment
that
it
rejected
the
viability
of
any
state
constitutional
grounds
because,
had
it
wished
to
address
those--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
however,
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--our
state
supreme
court
had
a
crack
at
this
case
and
did
decline
discretionary
review,
and
that
is
why
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
to
take
this
issue
directly
to
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wish--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--their--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--overreaching
is
an
epithet,
your
honor,
which
is
taken
directly
from
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
federal
cases
purporting
to
construe
this
court's
precedents
in
double
jeopardy
cases.
that
is
a
line
of
cases
which
we
believe
to
be
erroneous,
and
one
which
i
will
respectfully
address
on
rebuttal,
as
will
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
we
have
never
contended
that
the
nature
of
the
prosecutor's
conduct
was
appropriate.
we
are
merely
saying
it
does
not
fit
the
characterization
of
intentional
misconduct
designed
to
abort
a
trial
because
the
prosecution
wishes
a
more--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no,
it
is
the
law
of
the
federal
constitution
which
the
oregon
court
is
purporting
to
construe.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
is
the
law
of
the
case
of
state
versus
kennedy,
which
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
characterization
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
several
points.
first
of
all,
in
my
colloquy
with
you,
justice
marshal,
the
term
"overreaching"
arose.
the
origin
and
pedigree,
of
course,
of
that
term
comes
from
a
dictum
in
the
jorn
decision
by
this
court
which
was
construed
in
aberrant
ways
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
it's
clear
from
the
very
use
of
that
term
by
judge
gillette
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
oregon
that
in
fact
he
was
referring
to
a
line
of
aberrant
federal
cases.
that
leads
us
to
the
second
point,
which
is
really
a
combination
of
questions
and
concerns
raised
by
justice
stevens
and
justice
rehnquist,
concerning
intent,
various
kinds
of
epithets
used
to
characterize
the
prosecutor's
misconduct.
what
is
at
issue
is
the
importance
of
giving
a
predicate
to
those
particular
epithets.
that
is,
not
misconduct
in
the
abstract,
but
misconduct
which
is
deliberately
designed
to
accomplish
something,
i.e.,
aborting
the
trial.
that
seems
to
be,
to
us,
the
critical
question,
and
the
one
on
which
this
court's
decision--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
an
attempt
at
least
to
abort
the
trial.
perhaps
he
would
also
intend
not
to
be
discovered
doing
it,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
suppose
that
is
true.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
i
don't
think
so,
and
that
really
raises
another
point,
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
strong
analogy
to
the
rule
that
we
are
advancing
in
this
case
in
the
pre-indictment
delay
cases
and
discriminatory
prosecution
cases.
this
type
of
inquiry
is
not
unknown
to
this
court
or
to
the
federal
courts.
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
by
circumstantial
evidence
indeed
in
a
criminal
trial
by
circumstantial
evidence
and
inference
to
conclude
what
the
intent
was
of
a
defendant
who
never
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense.
so,
i
don't
think
that
it's
quite
the
paradox
or
the
dilemma
or
the
difficulty
for
a
trial
court
making
those
findings
as
might
appear
at
first
blush.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
but
one
has
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
at
best
a
very
narrow
exception
to
a
general
rule
that
the
issue
ought
not
ordinarily
to
be
before
the
court
at
all,
because
by
choosing
to
move
for
the
mistrial,
the
defendant
normally
is
electing
not
to
go
to
the
first
jury
at
all.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
i
do
not.
in
fact--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--in
fact,
it's
the
very
purpose
of
the
rule
that
we
are
announcing
to
make
it
clear
that
where
an
egregious
error
has
been
committed
in
the
trial,
that
the
defendant
and
the
trial
court
will
feel
free
to
start
the
trial
process
over
again
if
initiated
by
the
defendant.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
they
rejected
it
at
least
in
the
sense
that
it...
under
the
oregon
statutes,
which
were
also
part
of
the
decision
setting
forth
what
it
is
that
the
bailiff's
duties
were,
that
was
the
case,
but
let's
bear
in
mind
here
that
in
rathbun
there
was
a
hung
jury--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
at
least
in
the
context
of
the
rathbun
case,
but
the
rathbun
case
had
been
decided
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
i
think
that
one
of
the
appropriate
things
that
stems
from
the
rule
that
we
advance
is
that
the
trial
judge
is
in
a
position
to
make
those
findings,
and
we
will
accept
those
findings.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
a
different
trial
judge
made
the
decision.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
was
a
trial
judge
panel.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
i
suppose
under
unusual
circumstances,
of
course,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
one
to
seek
an
affidavit
from
that
judge
if
it
were
a
matter
on
which
they
felt
strongly.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
