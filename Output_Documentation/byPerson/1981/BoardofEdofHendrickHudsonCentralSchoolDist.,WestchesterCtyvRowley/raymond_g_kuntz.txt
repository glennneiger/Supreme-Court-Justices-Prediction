mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is:
did
the
hendrick
hudson
central
school
district
meet
the
requirements
of
public
law
94-142,
the
education
of
all
handicapped
children
act
of
1975,
when
it
provided
amy
rowley
with
an
educational
program
which
resulted
in
outstanding
academic
achievement
and
social
success,
although
it
did
not
comply
with
her
parents'
wishes
that
a
sign
language
interpreter
be
placed
in
her
classroom.
in
one
respect
the
case
that's
before
you
is
an
age
old
problem
that
confronts
every
public
school
board.
it's
not
unusual
in
the
course
of
any
child's
education
that
the
parents
disagree
with
the
program
prescribed
or
dictated
by
the
local
school
board.
and
the
question
before
you
then
becomes,
how
does
this
act
handle
a
disagreement
with
a
program
or
a
placement
developed
by
a
local
school
district
by
the
parents
when
the
parents
are
the
parents
of
a
handicapped
child.
according
to
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case,
if
they
are
able
to
persuade
a
court
that
they
have
a
rational
basis
for
the
program
that
they
advocate...
that
it's
a
slightly
better
program,
if
it
results
in
somewhat
improved
performance...
it's
their
claim
that
the
act
allows
them
to
go
to
court
and
to
have
the
court
dictate
to
the
local
educational
institution
that
better
program.
now,
this
is
not
a
case
where
no
services
were
provided
to
amy
rowley.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
extraordinary
care
was
taken
to
ensure
benefit
from
the
placement
that
was
developed
for
her
by
the
local
school
district.
before
amy
rowley
enrolled
in
the
hendrick
hudson
school
district,
plans
were
made
for
her
arrival
in
this
particular
school.
the
school
district
has
several
elementary
schools
and
in
this
particular
elementary
school
this
was
the
first
time
that
this
elementary
school
was
to
educate
a
deaf
child.
and
the
first
determination
made
by
the
school
district
prior
to
the
entry
of
amy
into
the
classroom
was
that
she
would
not
be
sent
to
a
school
for
the
deaf,
but
that
the
school
would
make
an
effort,
an
attempt
to
educate
her
in
a
regular
classroom.
now,
having
made
that
determination,
the
school
then
prepared
to
receive
her.
the
teachers
in
the
school
took
a
sign
language
course,
because
they
knew
that
amy
was
somewhat
familiar
with
sign
language
and
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
amy.
they
did
not
know
amy,
but
they
wanted
to
do
everything
that
they
thought
they
could
to
prepare
themselves
for
her
arrival
at
the
school.
the
school
district
purchased
a
teletype
machine
which
they
installed
in
the
office
of
the
principal.
amy's
parents
are
both
deaf,
they
have
a
teletype
machine,
and
consequently
the
school
and
the
parents
can
communicate
visually
by
means
of
the
teletype
machine.
the
school
then
went
a
little
bit
further.
they
hand
picked
amy's
teacher.
they
gave
her
a
teacher
that
they
thought
would
be
responsive
to
the
problems
provided
by
a
deaf
child.
they
put
her
in
a
small
classroom.
they
made
that
classroom
visually
oriented,
so
that
instead
of
ringing
bells
they
flashed
lights.
they
seated
amy...
they
gave
her
a
preferential
seating
so
that
she
was
in
a
position
to
see
everything
that
went
on;
in
other
words,
to
make
use
of
her
natural
facilities
to
enable
her
to
understand
what
was
going
on
in
that
classroom.
then
they
agreed
with
the
parents
that
an
experimental
program
would
be
conducted.
that
is,
during
the
first
year,
the
kindergarten
year,
would
be
a
time
of
trial
where
various
methods
would
be
experimented
with
to
see
what
was
appropriate
for
amy.
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
do
nothing,
so
that
they
could
have
some
base
data
upon
which
to
compare
the
results
of
the
other
experiments.
then
they
tried
a
variety
of
hearing
aids
to
see
what
kind
of
hearing,
supplemental
electronic
hearing,
worked
best.
they
tested
amy.
they
had
her
hearing
tested.
they
discovered
that
she
had
significant
residual
hearings
in
the
lower
frequencies.
that
means
that
the
vowel
sounds
are
audible
to
amy,
and
that
when
her
hearing
is
electronically
supplemented
she
can
understand
a
good
portion
of
what's
spoken
to
her.
they
tried
a
sign
language
interpreter
in
her
kindergarten
classroom.
they
put
the
sign
language
interpreter
in
for
a
two
week
trial
period
to
see
what
effect
this
would
have
upon
the
educational
program.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
two
week
period
everybody
who
participated
in
that
experiment,
including
the
sign
language
interpreter,
determined
that
it
was
not
a
useful
service
for
amy
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
might
be
a
distraction
for
amy.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
a
full
classroom.
there
was
also
a
constant
monitoring
of
her
program,
not
only
by
her
teachers
but
by
the
school
principal,
who
visited
her
classroom
almost
daily
to
make
sure
that
her
educational
program
was
progressing
satisfactorily.
now,
the
results
of
this
program
were
quite
satisfactory
to
the
school
district.
when
amy
entered
the
first
grade
there
was
a
determination
made
by
the
committee
on
the
handicapped,
and
it's
that
determination
which
is
ultimately
before
you
today.
she
was
classified
as
a
handicapped
child
and
she
was
classified
as
severely
deaf.
the
committee
on
the
handicapped
conducted
an
investigation
of
what
was
an
appropriate
placement
for
amy
in
first
grade.
they
visited
other
classrooms.
they
sent
one
of
their
members
to
see
amy
in
her
first
grade
classroom
setting
and
to
see
how
she
was
doing
there
with
the
services
that
had
been
provided
in
kindergarten.
the
committee
on
the
handicapped
dispatched
several
of
its
members
to
visit
other
classrooms
in
other
school
districts,
to
visit
a
school
for
the
deaf,
to
visit
a
board
of
cooperative
educational
classroom
where
deaf
children
were
taught
as
a
group.
they
consulted
experts
on
the
education
of
the
deaf.
they
read
articles
and
gathered
professional
materials
and
expert
opinions.
at
the
conclusion
of
that
process
they
came
back
in
early
october
and
determined
that
what
they
would
do
for
amy
was
to
place
her
in
a
regular...
to
allow
her
to
remain
placed
in
a
regular
first
grade
classroom,
to
supplement
her
hearing
with
an
fm
wireless
system
which
amplifies
the
sound
spoken
into
the
sending
unit,
thereby
blocking
out
all
other
sounds.
the
receiving
units
pick
up
only
what's
sent;
consequently,
it
doesn't
amplify
everything
and
background
noise
is
thereby
eliminated.
it
decided
that
what
they
would
do
is
give
her
the
services
of
a
speech
therapist
three
times
a
week;
that
she
would
receive
the
services
of
a
certified
teacher
of
the
deaf
an
hour
a
day,
who
would
serve
as
a
tutor
for
amy
during
the
regular
school
day.
she
was
again
placed
in
a
small
classroom.
it
was
again
very
visually
oriented.
her
teacher
was
again
hand
picked
so
that
the
teacher
would
be
responsive
to
amy's
needs.
now,
the
result
of
this
placement
was
outstanding
academic
and
social
success
for
amy.
she
went
into
the
first
grade
as
a
non
reader,
a
typical
thing
for
a
child
entering
the
first
grade.
when
she
left
the
first
grade
she
was
a
reader.
she
had
high
standardized
test
scores
developed
for
non
deaf
norms.
she
had
an
equivalent
class
rank.
in
other
words,
amy
placed
in
her
class
exactly
as
you
would
expect
her
to
place,
given
her
iq,
in
terms
of
how
that
iq
compared
with
everybody
else
in
that
particular
class.
she
had
excellent
peer
relationships
and
she
had
excellent
rapport
with
her
teachers.
this
program
shows
on
the
part
of
the
hendrick
hudson
school
district
a
deep
caring
for
amy
rowley.
the
school
district
believes
that
it
has
an
objective
view
as
to
what
is
the
best
program
for
amy.
it
believes
that
the
sign
language
interpreter
is
a
disservice.
the
school
district
has
built
bridges
of
meaning
to
amy,
and
the
court
dismantled
those
bridges
and
substituted
a
different
program
based
upon
what
we
contend
is
an
inaccurate
view
of
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
its
requirements.
it's
our
contention
that
the
act
is
a
funding
statute
and
that
as
a
funding
statute
the
provision
of
free
appropriate
public
education
is
a
goal;
that
it
requires
no
specific
services;
that
the
act
could
have
described
specific
services
and
it
did
not.
we
believe
that
education
is
a
state
matter
and
that
the
provision
of
services
and
the
determination
of
the
content
of
the
education
is
left
to
the
states
under
the
constitution.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
amy's
in
the
fourth
grade.
i
did
not
mention
it,
your
honor.
she's
in
the
fourth
grade
at
the
hendrick
hudson
school
district.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes.
as
a
result
of
the
affirmance
by
the
second
circuit
of
the
district
court
decision,
a
sign
language
interpreter
was
placed
in
her
classroom
early
in
the
third
grade.
our
review
of
the
progress
of
amy
indicates
that
she
has
continued
as
one
would
expect
her
to
continue,
that
she's
made
the
same
progress
with
the
sign
language
interpreter
that
she
made
without
the
sign
language
interpreter.
we
see
no
significant
difference.
while
she
has
made
some
increase
in
her
spelling
skills,
her
mathematics
skills
declined
somewhat,
but
not
precipitously
in
either
case
and
we
find
that
her
progress
has
continued
on
the
same
upward
satisfactory
level
that
it
did
prior
to
the
time
that
the
sign
language
interpreter
was
placed
in
her
classroom.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
because
that
happened
all
post
the
record.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
we
feel
that
there's
a
presumption
that
congress
passed
the
act
in
accord
with
traditional
principles.
we
feel
there's
nothing
in
the
act
or
its
history
that
points
to
an
intention
of
congress
to
act
in
derogation
of
the
principles.
we
believe
that
the
specifics
of
a
free
appropriate
public
education
are
limited
by
the
state
plans
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
education
under
the
act,
particularly
to
each
class
of
disability.
we
believe
that
this
view
is
consistent
with
the
description
and
purposes
of
a
state
plan
as
mandated
by
the
act.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
your
honor,
that's
our
position.
it's
the
contention
of
the
respondents
that
the
state
and
the
local
educational
agency,
in
acceding
to
the
provisions
of
section
1315
of
the
act,
that
is
that
they
will
guarantee
procedural
safeguards
with
respect
to
the
provision
of
free
and
appropriate
public
education,
lets
in
through
the
back
door
what
congress
declined
to
let
in
through
the
front
door;
in
other
words,
that
each
court
can
determine
a
particular
educational
program
under
the
remedial
sections
of
the
act.
and
we--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--yes,
we
believe
that,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
send
it
back.
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
simply
set
aside
the
state
plan
and
substitute
a
different
methodology
of
education.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
not
in
those
words.
it
provides
that
the
court
shall
receive
the
proceedings
of
the
administrative
agency,
at
the
request
of
either
party
shall
receive
new
evidence,
and
taking
all
of
that
into
consideration
make
its
determination
based
upon
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
granting
such
remedy
as
it
deems
appropriate.
but
we
say
even
if
it--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--yes,
i
suppose
it's
as
de
novo
as
you
can
get.
but
it
does
require
the
receipt
of
the
administrative
records
and
the
prior
determinations.
if
it
was
totally
de
novo,
i
would
think
that
the
requirement
to
receive
those
records
would
not
be
found
in
the
statute.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
there
are.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i
would
have
thought
so.
and
we
believe
that
the
proper
way
to
reconcile
those
differences
is
to
look
at
1415
as
remedial
only.
the
respondents
look
at
it,
and
some
of
the
amici
and
frankly
many
if
the
circuits
look
upon
it,
as
a
statute
granting
them
absolute
authority
to
write
a
new
substantive
program
without
regard
to
the
state
plan
and
without
regard
to
the
cost
of
whatever
program
they
devise.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
has
explicitly
ruled
that
cost
is
no
consideration
when
the
court
makes
its
determination
as
to
what
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
that
circuit
also
said
that
it
included
as
a
subset
of
appropriate
remedy
an
appropriate
education,
holding
that
when
it
had
the
power
to
devise
an
appropriate
remedy
that
included
within
that
power
was
the
power
to
devise
an
appropriate
education.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
in
our
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
we
specifically
set
forth
the
portions
of
our
brief
where
we
made
those
arguments.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i
would
think
that
in
that
particular
situation,
that
the
first
thing
that
would
occur
is
a
finding
that
the
procedure
had
not
been
followed.
i
seriously
doubt
whether
a
proper
view
of
the
child...
that
is,
the
act
requires
the
local
school
district
to
plan
for
the
unique
needs
of
that
child.
i
think
that's
a
procedural
requirement.
i
think
that
once
there's
an
explanation
of
what
those
needs
are
and
once
there
is
some
rational
relationship
developed
between
the
response
to
those
needs
and
the
program
that's
provided,
that
in
most
cases
the
local
school
district
will
come
out
with
an
adequate
and
acceptable
program.
i
tend
to
think
in
your
situation
that,
in
your
example,
that
you
would
find
so
many
procedural
errors
in
arriving
at
that
determination
that
there
would
be
no
need
to
get
into
a
substantive
determination.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i
would
hate
to
think
that
there
would
be
no
situation
where
the
court
couldn't
step
in
and
cure
a
totally
arbitrary
and
capricious
act.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i
totally
agree
with
you.
i
feel
that
there
is
that:
once
you
grant
one
case,
then
every
other
case
follows
behind
it,
and
it's
only
a
question
of
degree.
but
i
truly
believe
that
congress
did
not
in
this
particular
statute
move
in
and
determine
for
each
local
school
district
that
ultimately
what
is
to
be
the
governing
philosophy
in
that
particular
school
district
is
what
a
court,
federal
or
state,
tells
the
agency.
and
i'm
afraid
that's
what
happens
when
you
carry
the
logic
to
its
extreme
on
the
other
side.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
they
did.
they
not
only
complied
with
the
state
plan
as
it
specifies
services
for
deaf
children
whose
audiological
loss
is
within
the
range
that
amy's
is,
but
they
provided
extra
services
far
over
and
beyond
what
they
were
required
to
do.
i
think
critical
to
the
school
district's
position
is
that
program
that
they
developed
worked,
and
that
the
program
that
the
court
substituted
does
not
particularly
appear
to
the
school
district
to
be
that
much
better.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
school
district
believes
that
ultimately
in
the
long
run
it
does
amy
a
disservice,
because
it
does
not
take
advantage,
so
to
speak,
of
her
residual
skills.
it
does
not
take
advantage
and
promote
use
of
her
residual
hearing,
of
her
excellent
ability
to
lip
read.
and
those
skills
will
atrophy.
and
to
come
back
to
justice
marshall's
point
before,
while
it's
not
in
the
record
because
the
developments
occurred
post
the
trial,
it's
the
school
district's
finding
that
that's
what's
occurring
in
amy's
situation.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
i
think
because
they--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--then
it
becomes
a
case
about
amy,
as
the
court
said
in
its
opening
sentence:
"this
is
a
case
about
amy.
"
it's
also
a
case
about
the
law,
and
every
case
that's
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
precedent.
i
simply
don't
know
how
any
court
is
going
to
distinguish
amy's
case
from
the
case
of
any
other
deaf
child.
amy's
situation
is
not
an
unusual
situation.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
i
believe
that
they
have
to
adhere
in
the
individual
in
order
to
be
effective.
but
also,
i
would
say
that
all
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
become
precedent
for
all
other
factual
situations
which
are
similar
in
content
and
nature
to
the
one
addressed
by
the
court,
and
consequently
that
court
can't
simply
invoke
a
rule
which
has
no
purpose
in
this
particular
situation
and
attempt
to
limit
its
application.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
well,
they
attempt
to
invoke
rule
23
of
their
local
rules,
which
is
designed
to
limit
the
effectiveness
of
rulings
from
the
bench
that
are
made
in
the
course
of...
or
at
the
conclusion
of
arguments.
they
cannot
be
cited
as
precedent
before
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
attempted
to
invoke
its
rule
in
this
case
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
published
opinion
and
a
substantial
decision
by
judge
mansfield.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i
think
they
were,
and
i
think
the
implication
of
that
rule
reveals,
to
me
anyway,
that
they
were
somewhat
leery
of
the
precedent
that
they
were
creating
and
that
they
were
attempting
to
limit
it.
i
don't
think
that
they
were
deciding
on
the
law.
i
think
they
were
deciding
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
out
of
sympathy
to
amy.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i
would
say
that
if
a
substantive
right
has
been
created
at
all,
that's
where
it's
created.
it's
created
in
the
submission
of
the
state
plan
to
the
then
commissioner
and
now,
under
the
amendments
to
the
law,
to
the
secretary
of
education.
and
that's
the
only
place,
if
at
all,
that
a
substantive
right
appears.
i
think
there
are
substantive
rights
insofar
as
a
right
to
the
procedure
is
concerned.
but
i
think
that's
the
only
right
of
substance
that
was
enacted
by
the
statute.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
no,
it
wasn't,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
why
that
occurred
is
that
when
the
school
district
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
educational
program
provided
to
amy
was
in
conformity
with
the
state
plan,
on
the
hearing
of
that
motion
the
respondents
admitted
that
the
plan
had
been
developed,
that
the
plan
had
been
accepted
by
the
then
commissioner
of
education,
that
the
school
district
was
in
compliance
with
the
plan,
but
that
that
was
irrelevant.
and
consequently
the
plan
never
became
a
part
of
the
record,
because
it
was
never
at
issue.
we
felt
that
the
district
court
should
have
dismissed
the
case
at
that
point,
but
it
did
not.
it
did
not
address
itself
to
that
issue
in
its
decision
on
that
motion.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
we
believe
that
it
did.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
we
would
disagree
with
the
standard.
we
feel
that
the
full
potential
standard
is
something
that's
beyond
the
power
of
the
local
school
district.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
we
say
that
we
feel
that
there
are
standards
in
the
act.
we
think
the
act
defines
free
appropriate
public
education.
we
think
that
as
part
of
that
definition
the
definition
is
constrained
by
the
state
plan
submitted.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
they
contended
that,
but
that's
inaccurate.
we
did
not
make
that
concession.
i
have
reserved--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--we
agree
that...
we
contend,
rather...
excuse
me...
that
the
district
court
standard
is
not
an
appropriate
standard.
we've
written
four
briefs
to
this
court
specifically
with
that
allegation,
and
i
think
we've
analyzed
the
full
potential
standard
and
shown
two
things:
one,
that
that's
not
a
requirement
that
can
be
fulfilled
by
any
school
district.
the
full
potential
standard
is
an
impossible
standard.
the
tests
devised
by
judge
broderick
to
determine
whether
the
full
potential
had
been
met
are
simply
unworkable
tests.
there
are
no
measurements
to
gauge
what
the
potential...
the
fulfillment
of
that
potential
would
be.
there
are
no
tests
to
gauge
the
shortfall,
and
no
tests
to
gauge
the
comparison,
as
he
suggested,
between
the
shortfall
experienced
by
normal
children
and
the
shortfall
experienced
by
handicapped
children.
we
think
that
that
standard
is
simply
impossible.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
it
did
go.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
it
did
go
to
the
commissioner
of
education
and
the
commissioner
of
education
made
a
finding,
and
that
finding
is
in
the
record.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i'm
reserving
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
just
a
few
brief
comments
in
rebuttal.
in
answer
to
two
questions
raised
by
justice
stevens,
the
government's
brief
states
that...
i
think
you
have
the
figures
correctly...
around
$27,000.
consequently,
the
cost
is
about
$160
per
handicapped
child.
that
does
comport
with
the
national
average,
which
is
between
$150
to
$200.
and
the
state
of
new
york
received
$45
million
for
approximately
200,000
children.
so
consequently
the
statistics
show
that
a
significant
portion
of
that
burden
is
not
borne
by
the
federal
government.
the
records
also
show,
developed
by
congress
through
the
reports
submitted
to
congress
and
required
by
congress
and
submitted
by
the
secretary,
that
the
percentage
of
funding
is
on
a
decreasing
level.
it's
now
down
to,
in
this
last
fiscal
year,
approximately
eight
percent
of
the
cost
of
educating
the
average
child.
i
also
wanted
to
deal
just
for
a
moment,
too,
with
your
question
before
to
counsel
for
the
respondents
about
whether
the
decision
requires
every
child
to
have
a
sign
language
interpreter.
the
court
made,
in
our
view,
an
unwarranted
leap
from
an
audiological
test
conducted
in
isolation
in
a
laboratory
setting,
which
found
that
amy
only
could
hear
59
percent...
it
was
a
word
discrimination
test.
the
court
leapt
from
that
fact
to
a
conclusion
which
we
believe
is
unwarranted,
that
is
that
amy
understands
only
59
percent
of
what
transpires
in
her
class.
we
say
that
the
unrebutted
evidence
is
that
she
understands
nearly
all
of
what
transpires
in
her
class.
now,
the
court
was
able
to
reach
the
decision
it
did
by
adopting
the
philosophical
approach
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
and
that
approach
was
that
every
deaf
child
does
better
with
a
sign
language
interpreter
in
their
class.
amy
is
deaf,
consequently
she
does
better.
they
adopted
that
syllogism.
the
rationale
for
that
syllogism
was
presented
by
the
respondents'
experts
at
the
trial
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
case
was
tried
before
the
independent
hearing
officer
the
respondents'
case
consisted
of
three
witnesses
and
a
total
of
about
13
pages
of
testimony.
those
witnesses
established
these
facts:
amy
is
deaf,
amy's
parents
were
deaf,
amy's
parents
wanted
a
sign
language
interpreter
in
her
and
class,
and
written
evidence...
that
is,
expert
opinion...
was
to
the
effect
that
a
sign
language
interpreter
was
required
for
every
deaf
child.
the
parents
introduced
no
evidence
whatsoever
at
either
the
trial
before
the
independent
hearing
officer
or
at
the
trial
before
the
district
court
as
to
how
amy
was
doing
in
class,
because
in
their
view
that
consideration
was
irrelevant
because
of
the
philosophical
premise
adopted
by
the
particular
theory
of
deaf
education
promulgated
by
the
experts
brought
to
testify
on
amy's
behalf,
none
of
whom
had
ever
seen
amy
in
the
classroom.
and
to
the
contrary,
all
of
the
experts
testifying
on
the
district's
behalf,
all
had
observed
amy
in
the
classroom.
and
we
refer
you
to
the
joint
appendix,
where
we
have
put
the
testimony
by
one
of
the
witnesses
at
the
independent
hearing
and
one
of
the
witnesses
before
the
district
court.
and
we
think
that
that's
moving
and
convincing
testimony
that
amy
understands
nearly
all
of
what
transpires
in
her
classroom.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
if
you're
referring
to
what
services
the
school
district
provided,
i
believe
that--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--the
school
district
took
no
philosophical
position
on
what
it
should
do
for
deaf
children
as
a
class.
what
it
did
was
in
this
particular
case,
which
it
believes
it's
required
to
do
under
the
procedure--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--it
was
on
an
individual
basis.
it
then
developed
a
program
in
accordance
with
the
state
plan,
based
upon
amy's
unique
needs.
it
believes
that
it
met
the
tests
of
the
state
and
it
believes
that
it
succeeded
almost
beyond
expectation
in
achieving...
building
bridges
of
understanding
and
meaning
to
amy
so
that
she
could
succeed
in
her
classroom.
thank
you.
