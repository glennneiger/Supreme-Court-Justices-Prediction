mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
my
portion
of
the
argument
i
would
like
to
address
several
of
petitioner's
contentions
that
raise
fundamental
questions
about
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
in
1975.
relying
on
this
court's
recent
decision
last
term
in
pennhurst,
petitioners
argue
that
the
act
does
not
entitle
individual
handicapped
children
and
their
parents
to
claim
a
substantive
right
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
they
also
contend
that
the
judicial
review
provisions
of
the
act
limit
review
to
matters
of
procedure
and
do
not
permit
a
handicapped
child
and
his
or
her
parents
to
challenge
determinations
of
state
and
local
school
authorities
concerning
particular
services
that
are
to
be
given
to
an
individual
child.
instead,
petitioners
assert
that
the
act
merely
requires
that
the
services
provided
to
a
child
conform
to
the
state
plan
prepared
by
the
state
commissioner
of
education
pursuant
to
the
act,
and
that
if
the
individual
program
complies
with
the
plan
there
is
no
further
recourse.
these
claims
are
completely
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
as
reflected
in
the
language
and
history
of
the
statute.
unlike
the
state
at
issue
in
pennhurst,
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
requires
as
a
condition
for
receipt
of
federal
funds
that
each
recipient
state
have
in
effect
a
policy
that
assures
all
handicapped
children
the
right
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
the
act
also
requires
the
states,
as
a
condition
of
receiving
funds,
to
develop
a
plan
setting
forth
in
detail
the
procedures
and
policies
that
it
intends
to
provide
in
order
to
assure
that
a
free
appropriate
public
education
will
be
available
to
all
handicapped
children
within
the
state
within
certain
periods.
the
act
also
requires
as
a
condition
of
receiving
funds
that
the
states
establish
procedures
to
assure
that
to
the
maximum
extent
appropriate
handicapped
children
receive
supplemental
aids
and
services
to
allow
them
to
be
educated
together
with
non
handicapped
children.
the
legislative
history
confirms
that
congress
meant
to
establish
a
statutory
right
of
individual
handicapped
children
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
for
example--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--your
honor,
we
do
not
agree
with
that
particular
part
of
the
district
court's
opinion.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
it
did.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
did
not
rely
on
that
part
of
the
district
court's
opinion.
on
page
a-6
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
court
of
appeals
quoted
that
part
of
the
district
court's
opinion
that
stated
that
under
the
act
the
educational
authorities
involved
in
this
case
are
required
to
bring
amy's
educational
opportunity
up
to
a
level
of
educational
opportunity
being
offered
to
her
non
handicapped
peers.
in
other
words,
the
emphasis
is
not
on
potential
or
shortfall
from
potential,
but
on
the
making
available
to
handicapped
children
the
same
opportunities
that
are
available
to
non
handicapped
children
to
benefit
from
the
regular
educational
program
that
the
state
or
local
school
authorities
provide.
mr.
elliott
schulder
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
understand
the
petitioners'
contention,
but
unfortunately
for
petitioners
the
act
specifically
provides
an
express
private
right
of
action
to
every
handicapped
child
and
his
parents
regarding
any
complaint
concerning
any
matter
relating
to
the
provision
of
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
your
honor,
we're
only
dealing
with--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no.
well,
the
statute
does
provide
for
a
right
of
access
to
the
court.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
only
in
a
very,
very
small
number
of
cases--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
act
specifically
provides
for
access
to
courts
after
the
exhaustion
of
appropriate
administrative--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--theoretically
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
act
provides
that
the
district
court's
decision
shall
be
based
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
it
specifically
permits--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--about
any
matter
relating
to
the
provision
of
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
statute
provides
that
the
children
and
their
parents
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
regarding
any
matter
relating
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
don't
believe
that
would
necessarily
be
inconsistent
with
the
act,
no.
mr.
elliott
schulder
absolutely.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
is
or
is
not.
the
district
court
made
specific
findings
that
are
not
challenged
here.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no...
well,
he
may
have
said
that,
but
the
way
we
view
the
statute
the
appropriate
test
would
be
whether
or
not
a
handicapped
child
has
equal
access
to
the
same
educational
program
as
non
handicapped
children.
mr.
elliott
schulder
we
don't
talk
about
potentials
here.
we're
simply
talking
about
access
to
the
same
information.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
that
may
have
figured
in
congress'
enactment
of
the
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
may
have
figured
as
a
factor
in
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
that
aspect
of
the
district
court's
decision.
and
we
do
not
submit
that
the
court
needs
to
go
that
far
in
upholding
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
your
honor.
the
state
plan
is
simply
a
general
administrative
mechanism
for
the
state
to
develop
to
show
the
secretary
of
education
that
it's
in
general
compliance
with
the
goals
of
the
statute.
the
act
provides
that
the
free
appropriate
public
education
that
is
to
be
provided
the
handicapped
children
must
meet
the
unique
needs
of
each
child.
mr.
elliott
schulder
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
act
to
find
that
the
particular
school
district
has
developed--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
your
honor.
under
the
act,
the
plan
has
to
provide
that
the
educational
program
offered
and
made
available
to
each
handicapped
child
must
meet
the
child's
unique
needs.
that's
part
of
the
definition
of
the
appropriate
education
that,
as
a
condition
of
receiving
funds,
the
authorities
must
make
available.
mr.
elliott
schulder
we
don't
think
the
court
has
to
measure
potential,
but
we
do
believe
that
the
court
has
to
make
an
independent
determination
whether,
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
the
plan
as
developed
provides
the
child
in
question
access
to
the
same
educational
opportunity
available
to
non
handicapped
children.
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
clearly
supports
this
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
we
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief
that
states
that
new
york
received
in
fiscal
year
1980
$45
million,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
do
not
know
offhand.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
there
is
a...
i
do
know
that
there's
a
very
minimal
number
of
cases
that
reach
the
federal
or
state
courts,
your
honor.
in
the
amicus
brief
for
the
association
for
retarded
citizens,
at
pages
18
to
19
there
are
two
footnotes,
23
and
24,
that
indicate
that
very,
very
few
individual
cases
even
get
into
the
state
administrative
system,
and
a
very,
very
small
number,
between
200
and
300...
excuse
me?
mr.
elliott
schulder
excuse
me?
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
do
not
have
any
information
that
confirms
that,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
the
information
was
developed
from
sources,
studies
made
by
the
department
of
education.
the
act
in
question
here
has
two
basic
themes:
one
is
the
requirement
that
to
the
maximum
extent
appropriate
handicapped
children
are
to
be
mainstreamed,
that
is
educated
together
with
non
handicapped
children.
the
second
theme
of
the
act
is,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
providing
a
full
educational
opportunity
for
all
handicapped
children.
the
legislative
history,
as
i
said,
clearly
demonstrates
congress'
intent
that
participating
states
ensure
that
handicapped
children
have
an
equal
educational
opportunity.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
that
they
have
access
to
the
same
educational
program
that
is
available
to
other
non
handicapped
children
in
the
particular
school.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
congress
realized
that
there
were
wide
ranges
of
handicapping
conditions
anal
it
did
not--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--congress
did
not
fix
into
the
statute
a
particular
standard.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
dealing
with
a
particular
child
and,
it
decided
that
this
particular
child
has
above
average
intellectual
ability,
and
for
her
to
be
receiving
an
equal
educational
opportunity--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--not
that
it
applies
only
to
this
case,
but
it
would
apply
to
cases
of
children
with
average
or
above
average
intellectual
abilities.
in
other
words--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i
think
the
court
would
make
the
ultimate
determination,
but
would
clearly
rely
on...
excuse
me?
mr.
elliott
schulder
but
would
rely
on
information
developed
by
local
school
authorities
and
professional
experts.
in
fact,
in
the
development
of
an
individualized
education
program
there
are
several
factors
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration.
one
is
the
specific
testing
and
evaluation
of
the
student
involved.
the
other
is
professional
expertise
concerning
appropriate
programs
that
are
available.
mr.
elliott
schulder
we're
not
here
to
defend
the
wisdom
of
the
statute,
but
this
is
what
congress
appears
to
have
enacted,
your
honor.
and
we
feel
that,
for
the
reasons
that
we've
stated
here
and
in
our
briefs,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
your
honor.
congress
was
aware
that
providing
educational
services
for
handicapped
children
would
require
substantial
expenditures.
and
i
believe
the
estimates
that
were
developed
by
congress
or
at
hearings
before
congress
prior
to
passage
of
the
act
indicated
that
the
average
cost
of
educating
a
handicapped
child
would
be
approximately
1.9
or
2
percent
times
the
average
cost
of
educating
a
non
handicapped
child.
the
brief,
the
amicus
brief
of
the
cerebral
palsy
association
contains
statistics
that
show
that
the
actual
average
cost
that
statistics
have
been
prepared
for
since
the
act
has
been
in
effect
show
that
the
cost
has
been
within
the
range
that
congress
had
anticipated
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
that
the
goal
of
the
congress
was
to
provide
a
base
of
25
percent
of
the
total
cost,
but
i
believe
that
that
percentage
was
supposed
to
be
increased
from
year
to
year,
from
the
beginning.
the
first
year
that
the
act
was
to
take
effect,
which
was
i
believe
three
years--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
am
not
aware
of
the
particular
information.
but
if
the
school
district
believes
that
it
is,
as
a
result
of
the
statute,
being
placed
under
an
unnecessary
burden,
it
is
free
to
opt
out
of
the
program.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
the
district
i
believe
can,
as
well
as
the
state,
your
honor.
thank
you.
