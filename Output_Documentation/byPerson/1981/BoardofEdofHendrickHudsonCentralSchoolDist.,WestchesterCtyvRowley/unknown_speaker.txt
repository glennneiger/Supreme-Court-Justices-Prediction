unknown
speaker
were
there
other
children
in
the
classroom
while
these
experiments
were
going
on?
unknown
speaker
a
full
classroom?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kuntz,
perhaps
you
mentioned
it,
but
were
is
amy
now?
unknown
speaker
and
has
she
maintained
her
place
with
the
others?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
in
the
record,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
get
it
straight.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
take
it
that
under
the
state
plan
in
question
it's
your
position
that
the
school
district
could
have
furnished
an
interpreter,
but
was
not
required
to?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
contention
that
the
review
in
the
civil
action
provided
for
in
the
federal
district
court
in
1415
is
to
guarantee
only
the
procedural
safeguards
in
the
previous
administrative
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
the
section
does
provide
for
de
novo
review,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
pretty
de
novo,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
there
are
really
inconsistencies
on
cross
currents
in
the
statute,
are
there
not?
unknown
speaker
because
certainly
if
it
were
a
substantive
determination
that
the
judge
were
to
make,
you
would
expect
that
congress
would
have
provided
for
some
deference
to
the
administrative
record.
unknown
speaker
did
you
take
the
same
position
as
you're
now
expressing
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kuntz,
may
i
ask,
is
it
your
view
that
a
federal
judge
may
merely
require
compliance
with
the
procedures
specified
in
the
act
and
that
there
is
no
substantive
standard
that
the
federal
judge
may
apply
to
define
what
is
a
free
appropriate
public
education?
say
you're...
in
this
case,
i
know
it
is
not
the
case.
but
supposing
what
you
did
is
have
a
teacher
with
a
loud
voice
and
nothing
more,
or
something
like
that,
that
most
people
would
say
was
clearly
not
sufficient.
could
the
federal
judge
correct
anything
at
all
substantively?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
board
had
a
meeting
and
said,
we
really
can't
afford
to
buy
the
fm
wireless
and
we
can't
afford
to
have
our
teachers
take
the
time
off
to
take
sign
language
training,
as
you
did,
and
we
can't
afford
any
of
these
things.
we're
just
going
to
do
the
best
we
can,
which
is
to
select
the
teacher
we
think
would
have
the
best
rapport
and
has
the
best
diction,
but
did
very
little
other
than
that,
for
reasons
that
very
well
might
make
good
sense
for
a
board
that
has
a
tight
budget.
unknown
speaker
the
problem
i
have
with
the
case
is,
as
soon
as
you
acknowledge
that
there's
some
substantive
review,
then
what's
the
stopping
point?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that
this
school
board
has
done
more
than
they
were
required
to
do?
unknown
speaker
but
this
court
of
appeals
limited
its
decision
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
so
it
wasn't
any
broad,
general
sweep
like
you're
talking
about,
was
it?
it
said
that
you
were
wrong
in
this
case
for
the
facts
that
were
before
it
at
that
time.
what's
wrong
with
that?
isn't
that
the
normal
way
to
decide
a
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
all
constitutional
rights
individual?
unknown
speaker
what
rule
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
were
afraid
of
it
as
a
precedent?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
there
is
under
the
act
a
substantive
right
to
a
free
appropriate
education,
but
that
what
the
free
appropriate
education
would
consist
of
would
be
those
things
spelled
out
in
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
namely
an
individual
education
program
in
conformity
with
a
state
plan
which
has
been
approved.
would
you
concede
that
that
certainly
would
appear
at
least
to
be
within
the
framework
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kuntz,
is
the
new
york
plan
part
of
the
record?
unknown
speaker
is
the
new
york
plan
part
of
the
record?
was
it
introduced?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
adopt
the
district
court's
standard,
the
full
potential
standard?
unknown
speaker
suppose...
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you
say
that
even
if
that's
the
standard
you
don't
need
a
sign
language
interpreter
to
reach
that
standard.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
were
quite
clear
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
sign
language
interpreter
to
realize
a
person's
full
potential.
do
you
disagree
with
that
standard?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
that
the
state
need
not,
under
this
act,
live
up
to
that
standard?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the...
i
take
it
that
the
respondents
suggest
that
you
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
did
not
disagree
with
judge
broderick's
statement?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
necessarily
have
to
attack
the
standard,
because
you
do
have
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
agreeing,
as
i
understand
it,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
sign
language
interpreter
was
required
to
satisfy
the
full
potential
standard?
it's
difficult
for
us
to
go
behind
two
courts
who
agree
on
a
matter
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
place
in
the
record
to
show
why
this
case
didn't
originally
go
to
the
state
board
and
the
board
of
regents?
unknown
speaker
it
did.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chatoff,
did
the
evidence
show
at
the
trial
court
level
that
the
school
district
had
found
that
having
an
interpreter
present
was
a
distraction
to
the
child,
and
that
she
did
not
need
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt?
mr.
chatoff,
will
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
require
every
school
board
to
provide
a
sign
language
interpreter
for
every
deaf
child
in
the
country?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chatoff,
what
is
there
in
the
act
itself
or
the
accompanying
regulations
that
would
yield
the
precise
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied,
the
measurement
of
the
potential
and
determining
the
shortfall
and
applying
that
standard?
the
language
of
the
act
and
the
regulations
appear
to
require
no
more
than
an
individual
educational
program
and
in
accordance
with
the
state
plan.
unknown
speaker
how
does
one
get
from
there
to
the
standard
that
apparently
the
district
court
used
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
willing
to
see
used
in
this
case,
that
each
handicapped
child
be
given
an
opportunity
to
achieve
his
full
potential
commensurate
with
the
opportunity
provided
to
other
children?
unknown
speaker
it
came
out
of
the
law
review,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
petitioners
say
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
each
individual
handicapped
child
has
a
right
to
go
to
court.
unknown
speaker
the
petitioners
say
that
they
don't
want
each
individual
handicapped
child
to
litigate
his
particular
problem.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
the
child
says,
or
the
parents,
that
we
have
three
books
and
we
should
have
four,
we
go
to
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
my
hypothetical.
would
you
mind
dealing
with
it?
or
you
can
ignore
it.
it's
all
right
with
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
say,
to
get
closer
to
this
case,
if
they
say
you
need
a
number
72865
machine,
and
they
say
that's
the
wrong
machine,
we
need
another
machine.
that
would
be
litigated?
obviously
you
don't
mean
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
is
that
that
would...
they
could
go
to
court
on
that?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
can
they
or
can't
they.
unknown
speaker
they
can?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
you
haven't
answered
yet
what
the
standard
should
be
on
review.
it's
not
inconsistent
with
what
the
act
says,
even
if
it's
a
de
novo
hearing,
that
all
the
district
court
might
be
allowed
to
do
is
to
determine
whether
the
school
had
acted
arbitrarily,
rather
than
arriving
at
some
independent
judgment
about
what
a--
unknown
speaker
--about
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
but
what's
this
court
supposed
to
do?
independently
make
its
own
judgment
or...
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
act
of
the
district
court
said,
all
i'm
allowed
to
do
is
to
decide
whether
the
school
acted
arbitrarily?
is
that
inconsistent
with
the
act?
unknown
speaker
so
i'm
not
going
to
decide
it
independently,
as
though
i
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
inconsistent
with
the
act?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case?
it
is
not,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
certainly
disagreed
with
the
school,
and
he
didn't
say...
their
standard
certainly
wasn't
arbitrariness.
it
was
just
that
this
plan
doesn't
provide
for
full
development
of
the
child.
unknown
speaker
to
do
what?
to
fulfil--
unknown
speaker
--maybe
we
need
to
talk
about
this
potential,
because
that
certainly
figured
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it
figured
in
the
decision
of
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
to
believe
that
as
long
as
there
is
an
individual
educational
program
and
plan
made
for
the
child
which
is
within
the
meaning
and
requirements
of
the
state
plan,
which
has
been
in
turn
approved
by
the
appropriate
federal
official,
that
that
is
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
you
didn't
hear
my
question.
i
said,
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
act
to
find
that
the
school
district
has
complied
with
it
if
it
has
an
individual
educational
plan
for
that
individual
child
which
is
in
conformity
with
the
state
plan,
which
in
turn
has
been
approved?
is
that
inconsistent
with
the
act?
unknown
speaker
if
a
court
is
faced
with
the
problem
that
it
was
faced
with
the
problem
that
it
was
faced
with
here
and
it
determines
that
the
school
district
has
developed
an
individual
plan
for
the
child,
considering
the
handicap
and
the
requirements,
and
that
the
plan,
the
individual
plan,
is
consistent
with
the
state
plan,
is
that
not
enough
under
the
act?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
the
school
district
says
that
it's
done
that
by
developing
its
individual
plan,
why
does
the
court
have
to
go
further
and
measure
potential
and
try
to
develop
shortfall
and
make
other
inquiry?
why
isn't
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
do
you
know
how
much
federal
money
new
york
receives
under
this
act
every
year?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
children
are
benefited
by
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
of
these
cases
reach
the
federal
courts
every
year?
unknown
speaker
does
your
office
agree
with
that
information?
unknown
speaker
does
your
office
agree
with
that
information
in
the
amicus
brief?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
recognition
whatever
in
your
submission
that
the
degree
of
disability
varies
very
widely?
sadly,
there
are
some
children
with
iq's
of
40,
deaf
and
dumb.
what
is
a
state
required
to
do
with
respect
to
such
a
child?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
to
set
up
a
special
school?
unknown
speaker
but
this
court
has
prescribed
a
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
your
position
that
the
standard
of
the
second
circuit
is
not
a
general
standard,
although
you've
been
using
it
throughout
your
argument,
but
applies
only
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
who
determines
average
or
above
average
ability?
a
court?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you.
unknown
speaker
and
so
federal
courts
would
be
reviewing
decisions
of
state
boards
of
education
in
every
one
of
these
cases
in
which
the
parents
chose
to
bring
a
suit?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
follow
up
question
to
what
i
believe
justice
blackmun
asked
you
about
cost.
i
don't
recall
the
exact
figure
you
gave,
but
i
think
there's
something
in
the
brief
to
the
effect
that
this
particular
district
received
about
$27,000
for
i
think
140
or
150
handicapped
children,
which
means
they
get
somewhere
between
$150
and
$200
a
child.
is
that
what
would
be
the
typical
amount
of
federal
support?
unknown
speaker
that's
cost
to
the
state
school
district.
my
question
really
concerned
what
is
the
magnitude
of
the
federal
support
per
child.
what
is
the
federal
contribution?
unknown
speaker
are
you
able
to
tell
me...
and
if
you're
not
it's
perfectly
all
right...
how
many
dollars
per
handicapped
child
in
this
school
district
congress
actually
provided?
the
federal
contribution
is
based
on
the
number
of
handicapped
children
in
the
district,
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
or
does
the
record
tell
us
how
much
was
given
to
this
school
district
per
child?
in
other
words,
how
much
of
the
burden
of
paying
for
the
interpreter
has
the
federal
government
assumed,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
the
district
can,
or
the
state?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kuntz,
where
will
i
find
in
the
record
the
best
statement
of
the
school
board's
policy
on
this
particular
matter?
unknown
speaker
what
is
their
program?
where
can
i
find
exactly
what
they
propose
to
do
about
handicapped
children,
specifically
deaf
children?
is
there
anyplace
i
can
find
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
on
an
individual
basis?
