mr.
michael
a.
chatoff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
is
this:
has
a
school
district
that
receives
funds
under
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
upon,
its
commitment
to
provide
each
handicapped
child
with
a
free
appropriate
public
education
fulfilled
that
obligation
when
it
fails
to
provide
a
specific
deaf
child
with
the
services
necessary
for
that
child
to
receive
an
educational
opportunity
equivalent
to
the
educational
opportunity
provided
to
other
children?
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
amy
rowley,
who
is
deaf...
she
is
now
ten
years
old
and
in
fourth
grade...
and
her
parents
clifford
and
nancy
rowley.
this
is
not
your
typical
everyday
family.
clifford
and
nancy
rowley
are
deaf,
too.
upon
learning
of
amy's
deafness,
they
began
training
amy
in
the
use
of
total
communication,
the
mode
of
communication
used
in
their
home.
total
communication
is
a
flexible
mode
of
communication
using
lip
reading,
amplification
of
residual
hearing,
if
any,
sign
language,
finger
spelling,
and
visual
cues.
the
lower
court
found
that
relying
upon
lip
reading
and
amplification
only
amy
does
not
have
access
to
more
than
two
thirds
of
all
communications.
the
lower
court
found
that
relying
upon
total
communication
amy
has
access
to
100
percent
of
all
communications.
therefore,
the
lower
court
found
that
a
program
relying
upon
lip
reading
and
amplification
only
would
not
be
appropriate
for
amy
rowley.
recipients
of
funds
under
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
commit
themselves
to
provide
each
handicapped
child
within
its
borders
with
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
a
free
appropriate
public
education
is
specially
designed
instruction
to
meet
the
handicapped
child's
unique
needs
in
order
to
provide
that
child
with
an
equal
educational
opportunity.
the
petitioners
and
their
amicus
concede
that
the
goal
of
the
act
is
to
provide
handicapped
children
with
equal
educational
opportunities.
among
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
determining
what
is
a
free
appropriate
public
education
for
each
child
is
the
extent
of
that
child's
disability
and
that
child's
upbringing.
amy's
unique
needs
are
obvious.
the
shortfall
in
her
comprehension
is
precisely
the
deficiency
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
directed
recipients
to
provide
for
the
unique
needs
of
each
handicapped
child.
amy
needs
a
visual
depiction
of
oral
communications.
she
can't
learn
if
she
can't
understand,
and
she
can't
understand
if
material
is
presented
to
her
in
a
mode
of
communication
that's
closed
to
her.
an
interpreter
merely
provides
amy
with
access
to
the
same
education
as
available
to
every
other
student,
no
more
and
no
less.
mr.
michael
a.
chatoff
the
trial
court
found
that
the
school
district
said
that
providing
an
interpreter
would
be
a
distraction
to
amy.
however,
relying
upon
expert
evidence
and
written
statements
in
the
record,
the
trial
court
determined
that
an
interpreter
would
not
be
a
distraction
for
amy.
amy
is
not
special
because
she's
deaf.
any
has
special
needs
resulting
from
her
deafness.
it
is
those
special
needs
that
congress
directed
recipients
to
accommodate
in
order
to
fulfil
its
obligations
under
the
act.
if
amy
is
special...
and
even
the
witnesses
for
the
petitioners
concede
that
she
is...
she
is
special
because
of
her
intelligence
and
her
creativity
and
her
enthusiasm
and
her
rapport
with
others.
i
don't
believe
anyone
would
question
the
fact
that
there
have
been
past
deficiencies
in
the
education
of
deaf
children.
but
that's
all
water
under
the
bridge.
we
can't
correct
past
deficiencies
by
providing
amy
with
anything
on
a
silver
platter.
this
is
a
tough
world.
it's
going
to
be
as
tough
for
amy
as
it
will
be
for
every
other
child.
she'll
have
no
preparation
for
that
world
if
things
are
handed
to
her
in
a
silver
lining.
but
if
she
is
going
to
compete
in
this
world,
she
must
receive
an
education
equivalent
to
other
children.
this
court
said
that
education
is
the
principal
instrument
for
preparing
the
child
for
later
professional
training
and
helping
that
child
to
adjust
normally
to
its
environment.
once
amy
gets
an
education,
an
equivalent
education,
what
she
does
with
that
education
is
up
to
her.
the
school
district
has
no
obligation
to
guarantee
her
any
particular
level
of
achievement,
only
the
same
opportunity
to
achieve
as
everyone
else.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
accommodate
the
unique
needs
of
each
handicapped
child
so
that
the
deficiencies
of
the
past
do
not
reoccur
in
the
future.
the
act
covers
gifted
handicapped
children,
and
amy
has
the
intelligence
and
the
desire--
mr.
michael
a.
chatoff
--definitely
not.
the
statute
requires
an
individual
determination
of
the
needs
of
each
handicapped
child.
the
deaf
community
is
not
a
monolithic
entity.
although
all
deaf
children
have
in
common
their
hearing
loss,
their
other
characteristics
are
all
different.
every
child
is
different.
every
child
is
brought
up
differently.
some
use
strictly
oral
methods
of
communication.
some
use
oral
speech.
some
use
the
rochester
method.
some
use
what
is
known
as
american
sign
language.
we
discussed
that
in
the
trial
court.
not
every
deaf
child
can
be
educated
in
the
public
school.
in
fact,
very
few
can.
amy
happens
to
be
one
of
those
very
few.
children
who
are
educated
in
special
schools
or
in
research
rooms
have
no
need
for
interpreters.
children
raised
using
the
oral
method
have
no
need
for
interpreters.
it
will
be
only
very
specific
instances.
this
case
does
not
establish
that
any
or
every
other
child
is
entitled
to
an
interpreter.
the
commissioner
of
education
of
new
york
state
held...
this
decision
is
the
appendix
to
the
brief
submitted
by
the
national
association
of
the
deaf...
that
merely
because
amy
is
entitled
to
an
interpreter
does
not
mean
that
any
other
deaf
child
is
entitled
to
an
interpreter.
this
case
involves
amy
and
only
amy
and
does
not
go
beyond
amy's
particular
and
individual
needs.
mr.
michael
a.
chatoff
the
act
requires
specific
individualized
instruction
for
each
handicapped
child.
the
equal
educational
opportunity
standard
is
set
forth
in
the
senate
report
and
in
the
congressional
debate
accompanying
the
act.
i
think
that
that
should
be
responsive
to
your
question.
i
would
only
add
that
if
amy
receives
the
proper
education
she
can
become
a
doctor,
a
lawyer,
an
engineer.
the
only
occupations
that
are
closed
to
her
would
be
those
of
disc
jockey
and
telephone
operator.
congress
made
a
legislative
determination
that
each
child's
opportunities
shall
not
be
limited
beyond
those
restrictions
inherent
in
the
child's
disability.
thank
you.
