mr.
david
h.
allshouse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
action
brought
under
42
usc
section
1983
by
a
mentally
retarded
resident
of
pennhurst
state
school
and
hospital.
the
plaintiff
seeks
damages
in
this
action
based
on
his
treatment
while
there
from
three
supervisory
officials
at
pennhurst.
in
the
district
court
the
case
was
tried
before
a
jury
which
found
in
favor
of
each
of
the
defendants.
on
appeal
the
third
circuit
vacated
and
remanded
the
case,
holding
that
the
institutionalized
mentally
retarded
had
a
number
of
substantive
due
process
rights,
including
first
a
right
to
treatment
which
must
be
acceptable
in
light
of
present
scientific
or
medical
knowledge,
and
also
must
be
the
least
intrusive
available
under
certain
circumstances.
secondly,
a
right
to
be
free
of
restraint
absent
a
showing
of
substantial
or
compelling
necessity
by
the
state
and
also
a
showing
that
the
least
restrictive
alternative
was
used.
and
finally,
it
held
that
there
was
a
right,
a
constitutional
right
to
be
protected
from
harm
absent
a
showing
by
the
state
of
substantial
necessity.
it's
our--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
one
of
the
critical
flaws
in
the
third
circuit
decision.
this
is
an
area
where
experts
continue
to
disagree
as
to
the
types
and
benefits
of
various
levels
of
treatment.
and
an
example
of
the
way
the
third
circuit
has
ignored
this
court's
warning
as
to
the
fact
that
courts
are
poorly
equipped
to
make
medical
judgments
are
what
it
has
done
with
the
treatment
standards
and
the
particular
standards
that
would
apply
to
the
various
rights
which
it
found.
for
example,
it
would
use
such
phrases
as
"least
intrusive",
"compelling
necessity",
"least
restrictive"
to
those
concepts.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
absolutely,
your
honor.
these
buzz
words
are
difficult
for
the
health
care
professionals
who
are
responsible
for
implementing
those
standards
to
understand
and
apply,
and
the
danger
of
applying
such
concepts
in
this
area
is
to
force
health
care
professionals
to
make
decisions
not
necessarily
based
on
their
professional
opinion
as
to
what
is
best
for
the
mentally
retarded,
but
rather
on
what
the
third
circuit
would
require
based
on
its
decision
in
this
case.
a
good
example
of
the
way
in
which
the
third
circuit
has
made
medical
psychological
judgments
is
what
it
has
done
with
the
concept
of
restraints.
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
use
of
restraints
is
presumptively
punitive,
and
to
quote
the
court
below,
"has
been
relegated
to
the
closets
of
an
earlier
age.
"
nevertheless,
federal
regulations,
the
various
amici
organizations
in
this
court,
and
even
plaintiffs
recognize
the
use
of
restraints
under
certain
circumstances.
in
addition,
in
the
very
limited
circumstances
where
the
court
below
would
recognize
use
of
restraints
on
the
mentally
retarded,
it
did
so
only
for
protection
of
the
resident
himself
or
for
treatment.
once
again,
however,
the
various
amici
organizations
and
federal
regulations
recognize
use
of
restraints
in
some
circumstances
either
for
protection
of
the
resident
or
for
protection
of
others.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
in
this
case
as
to
the
use
of
restraints,
we
don't
have
specific
findings
by
the
jury,
but
the
record
does
reflect
that
the
use
of
restraints
being
challenged
here
is
use
of
restraints
which
occurred
while
mr.
romeo
was
in
the
medical
ward,
the
hospital
ward
at
pennhurst.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
your
honor,
under
the
proper
standard,
which
we
would
urge
this
court
to
adopt,
no
purpose
would
be
served
by
a
remand.
under
the
proper
standard
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
moreover,
the
third
circuit
has
clearly
in
an
en
banc
decision
decided
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
institutionalized
mentally
retarded.
that
decision
will
apply
on
remand
in
this
case
and
will
apply
to
all
other
cases,
at
least
in
the
third
circuit,
so
long
as
that
decision
stands.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
your
honor,
this
record,
in
our
view,
contains
all
the
facts
necessary
for
the
court
to
make
its
decision.
under
the
standard
we
urge
the
third
circuit
should
have
adopted,
the
traditional
due
process
test
would
apply;
and
that
is,
whether
or
not
conditions
of
confinement
are
rationally
related
to
some
legitimate
state
interest.
such
interest
in
the
context
of
care
of
the
mentally
retarded
in
state
institutions
include
provision
of
care,
provision
of
treatment,
protection
of
the
resident
or
protection
from
others,
and
certain
administrative
concerns
in
the
management
of
the
institution.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
we
urge
that
the
issue
of
good
faith
immunity
is
an
alternative
basis
for
affirming
the
district
court's
judgment
in
vacating
the--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
we
did
not
separately
raise
cross
appeal
on
the
issue
of
good
faith
immunity,
because
when
a
defendant
prevails
in
the
district
court,
we
do
not
understand
that
is
any
such
burden.
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
discussing
the
right
to
treatment,
discussion
of
such
cases
as
wood,
procunier
and
scheuer
was
included
in
our
discussion
of
those
rights.
therefore,
we
believe
the
court
erred,
independently
of
its
finding
of
constitutional
rights,
in
remanding
the
case
without
ruling
that
these
individuals
were
entitled
to
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
immunity
issue
as
defined
by
this
court's
decisions
reflects
that
there
is
both
an
objective
element
and
a
subjective
element.
as
to
the
objective
element,
the
rights
which
we
argue
about
today
certainly
were
not
clearly
established
between
1974
and
1978.
as
to
the
subjective
element,
the
record
reflects
here
that
while
mr.
romeo
suffered
injuries
on
various
occasions
while
he
was
at
pennhurst,
the
record
also
reflects
that
mr.
romeo
was
a
very
aggressive,
violent
individual
both
toward
himself
and
toward
others,
and
that
while
he
was
at
pennhurst
he
sustained
a
number
of
injuries
which
were
self
inflicted,
a
number
of
injuries
which
occurred
as
a
result
of
other
patients
retaliating
against
him
for
his
aggressive
behavior,
and
a
number
of
the
injuries
were
simply
accidents.
therefore,
as
to
that
aspect
there
could
be
no
finding
of
malice.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
would
not.
as
to
the
question
of
restraints,
the
offered
expert
testimony
would
have
said
that
restraints
were
used
for
the
convenience
for
the
staff.
that,
i
submit,
is
not
the
question.
restraints,
even
if
that
testimony
were
admitted,
restraints
could
be
used
for
the
convenience
of
staff
and
still
used
for
the
protection
of
mr.
romeo
and
others.
indeed,
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
restraints
were
used
for
the
protection
of
mr.
romeo
and
especially
protection
of
others.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
i
would
respectfully
disagree
in
the
sense
that
the
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
restraints
were
used
for
convenience
of
the
staff
does
not
go
to
the
constitutional
issue;
and
that
is,
whether
there
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
for
use
of
restraints.
the
record
reflected
in
this
case
that
restraints
were
used
in
the
hospital
ward
and
were
used
only
when
prescribed
by
a
physician,
none
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
moreover,
the
restraints
were
used
because
mr.
romeo
was
in
close
proximity
to
other
patients,
some
of
whom
had
intravenous
tubes
attached,
some
of
whom
were
in
traction.
and
given
his
aggressive
behavior,
he
posed
a
danger
to
these
individuals.
moreover,
mr.
romeo's
very
presence
in
the
hospital--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--no.
i
could
not
go
that
far,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
the
convenience
of
the
staff
alone
would
not
answer
the
question
if
those
restraints
were
not
used
either
for
protection
of
the
resident
or
protection
of
others.
also,
there
is
an
aspect
of
reasonableness
to
the
rational
relationship
test.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
chief
judge
sites'
test
is
essentially
a
modified
malpractice
standard.
it
still
requires
a
weighing
of
the
professional
and
medical
judgments
in
this
area,
and
essentially
comes
to
the
bottom
line
of
deciding
whether
there's
a
substantial
departure.
as
such,
it's
phrased
in
malpractice
terms.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
in
practical
effect
it
may
very
well
be.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
your
honor,
the
standard
proposed
by
chief
judge
sites
in
his
concurrence
was
proposed
as
an
alternative
bases
or
his
view
as
to
what
the
district
court
jury
should
be
instructed
on
remand.
we
submit
that
under
the
proper
standard
that
the
jury,
if
instructed
under
that
basis,
or
based
on
this
record
that
the
jury
would
have
had
to
find
in
our
favor;
in
essence,
would
have
had
to
find
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
because
under
the
standard
the
jury...
well,
even
without
the
standard
the
jury
was
instructed
by,
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
such
that
it
would
have
mandated,
and
in
fact
the
district
court
judge
should
have
granted
a
directed
verdict
for
defendants.
under
the
standard,
the
rational
relationship
test
which
we
proposed,
as
a
matter
of
law
defendants
would
be
entitled
to
a
judgment.
now,
while
chief
judge
sites'
test
is
different
in
wording,
we
would
submit
that
under
his
test
the
case
is
still
in
a
posture
where
it
would
be
necessary
for
a
remand,
and
indeed,
chief
judge
sites
indicated
that
was
the
case.
under
the
test,
the
rational
relationship
test
which
we
proposed,
defendants
are
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
correct.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no.
it
would
have
to
be
a
legitimate
state
interest
in--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--well,
it
may
be
that
if
a
decision
were
made
purely
for
the
convenience
of
the
staff
that
we
could
defend
that
as
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
in
the
facts
of
this
case
the
court
need
not
reach
that
question,
because
in
this
case
it's
clear
that
restraints
were
only--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--yes.
we
recognize
that--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--well,
i
would
answer
that
there
are--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--there
is
a
liberty
interest
to
the
extent
that
the
state
must
show
some
rational
relationship
for
use
of
restraints.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
on
the
right
to
treatment,
we
submit
that
the
way
that
issue
must
be
resolved
is
that
you
start
with
the
premise
that
the
states
are
under
no
affirmative
obligation
to
provide
government
services.
when
they
choose
to
provide
those
services,
they
have
wide
discretion.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
we
submit
that
care
is
a
constitutional
basis
for
commitment,
and
that
once
a
state
assumes
an
obligation
to
care,
and
we
recognize
that
we
do--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--yes.
we
disagree
completely
with
the
third
circuit
on
that.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
yes.
we
would
recognize
some
liberty
interest,
although
not
fundamental
in
the
way
in
which
this
court
has
described
fundamental
liberty
interest.
there
are
liberty
interests
much
in
the
nature
of
this
court's
holding.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
it
would
have
to
be
tried
on
that
issue.
although
based
on
the
record
in
this
case,
particularly
on
the
protection
from
harm
issue,
you're
faced
with
a
situation
where
plaintiff
proposed
three
jury
instructions
on
protection
from
harm.
all
three
were
granted.
therefore,
the
jury
tried
the
protection
from
harm
issue
as
plaintiff
had
phrased
the
constitutional
standard.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
essentially
it
was
phrased
in
terms
of
if
defendants
knew
or
had
reason
to
know
that
attacks
were
occurring
on
mr.
romeo
and
did
nothing
to
prevent
it
or
failed
to
take
all
reasonable
steps
to
prevent
it,
then
a
constitutional
violation
had
occurred.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
on
that
issue
the
third
circuit
sua
sponte
addressed
that
issue.
the
issue
was
never
before
the
third
circuit,
and
on
that
basis
alone
the
protection
from
harm
issue
should
be
vacated.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
they
went
beyond
what
the
district
court
judge
and
plaintiffs
had
suggested
below.
now,
as
to
the
treatment
issue
before
the
jury,
the
reason
why
remand
would
not
be
necessary
on
that
issue
is
that
the
only
testimony
offered
was
expert
testimony
to
suggest
that
different
programs
could
have
been
used
or
better
programs.
that
does
not,
in
our
view,
constitute
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
constitutionally
that
that
is
a
sufficient
standard,
as
long
as
it's
rational.
this
court
has
in
the
bell
case
provided
the
caveat
that
if
the
means
used
are
somehow
excessive
and
totally
beyond
rational
interest
that
that
also
would
be
a
consideration.
i
think
that's
part
of
the
concept
of
being
reasonable
or
rational,
and
therefore,
that's
part
of
the
same
concept.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
based
upon--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--based
on
the
evidence
presented
at
trial,
the
physician
who
prescribed
the
restraints
testified
that
he
prescribed
them
to
protect
mr.
romeo
and
to
protect
others;
and
there
was
no
evidence
presented
to
the
effect
that
that
was
not
the
purpose
behind
the
restraints.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
for
two
reasons.
either
based
on
good
faith
immunity
where
there
is
no
evidence--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--that's
correct.
but
whereas
here
you
have
no
evidence
which
would
support
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
where
the
case
indeed
should
not
have
even
gone
to
the
jury,
we
submit
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
decide
the
issue
on
that
basis.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
on
the
current
state
of
the
record
this
case
would
go
back
to
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
jury
would
be
instructed
precisely
as
the
third
circuit
had
provided.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
we
think
that
in
addition
to
the
other
factors
there's
a
judicial
economy
interest
in
not
having
what
originally
was
a
week
and
a
half
trial
and
could
easily
be
a
long
trial
occur
again,
when
if
we
are
correct
it
would
be
a
futile
act
in
all
likelihood.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
why
should
the
third
circuit--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--well,
the
third
circuit
did
not
agree
with
our
standards,
and
therefore--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--well,
that,
of
course,
is
an
alternative
way
of
deciding
the
case.
it's
our
position
that
where
you're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
a
person
such
as
mr.
romeo,
who
is
unable
to
care
for
himself,
is
committed
to
a
state
institution...
and
there's
no
dispute
that
he
was
unable
to
care
for
himself
when
he
was
committed
in
1974...
that
the
state
does
assume
an
obligation
to
care
for
him;
but
beyond
that
it
does
not
thereby
constitutionally
incur
the
obligation
of
trying
to
treat
or
habilitate
him.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
the
term
"warehousing"
has
very
negative
concepts,
but
custodial
care
or
care,
namely
food,
shelter,
clothing,
medical
care,
and
reasonable
safety,
is
what
we
mean.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
there
is
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
obligation,
your
honor.
while
the
state
may
decide
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
policy
to
provide
habilitative
services
to
the
mentally
retarded...
and
indeed
pennsylvania
does
and
commits
a
large
portion
of
its
budget
for
that
purpose
every
year...
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
mandate
that
it
do
so.
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
worded
in
such
affirmative
terms,
and
thus,
where
the
state
assumes
this
obligation,
it
does
not
incur
the
duty
to
attempt
to
habilitate,
which
is
consistent
with
fiscal
reality
in
a
time
of
budget
crises
at
all
levels
of
government.
under
the
third
circuit
standard
a
state
might
be
faced
with
a
very
difficult
choice
between
deciding
whether
or
not
to
provide
lifesaving
care
to
a
large
number
of
mentally
retarded
individuals
or
providing
the
more
comprehensive
habilitative
services
required
by
the
third
circuit's
decision
to
a
substantially
reduced
number
of
people.
it's
our
position
that
the
state
should
not
be
faced
with
a
choice
like
that
or
a
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
it
can
afford
to
financially
assume
this
obligation
of
habilitation
before
it
simply
acts
to
prevent
the
mentally
retarded
who
are
unable
to
care
for
themselves
from
freezing
or
starving
to
death.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
that
may
be
a
very
compelling
question
of
social
policy,
whether
or
not
a
state
should
allow
that
to
happen,
but
constitutionally
there
is
no
requirement
either
in
the
mental
institution
setting
or
in
prison
settings
to
maintain
skills,
to--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--that's
correct.
because
if
the
state
were
required
to
assume
an
obligation
to
maintain
skills,
what
you
could
be
faced
with
is
a
situation
where
an
individual
prior
to
the
time
he
was
committed
had
received
excellent
services
from
a
private
source
and
had
high
skill
levels
comparatively.
when
that
person,
for
example,
out
of
loss
of
money,
lost
that
private
source,
was
unable
to
care
for
himself,
when
the
state
thereby
commits
that
person
it
would
here
to
assume
a
very
high
obligation
to
him
if
it
had
to
maintain
his
skills.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no,
your
honor.
the
concept
of
psychiatric
care
can
be
separated
from
the
concept
of
medical
care.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no.
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
situation
where
an
individual
presents
a
danger
to
himself
or
to
others,
and
in
that
circumstance
the
concept
of
care,
of
reasonable
protection
of
both
that
individual
and
other
individuals
may
require
certain
action
by
the
state.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
the
question
of
psychiatric
care
and
medical
care
are
admittedly
very
similar
concepts.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
and
it's
difficult
to
distinguish
where
care
ends
and
habilitation
begins.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
we
believe
that
while
even
the
third
circuit
below
recognized
the
distinction
between
care
and
habilitation,
that
that
is
a
valid
distinction;
that
the
question
of
habilitation
in
terms
of
preserving
skills
or
improving
someone's
functioning
level
is
a
different
question
than
just
care.
and
it
may
well
be
on
certain
fact
situations
that
psychiatric
care.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
we
believe
to
provide
conditions
that
are--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--yes.
under
the
traditional
rational
relationship
test.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--well,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
our
view,
provides
for
conditions
reasonably
related
to
legitimate
interests.
care...
if
we
did
not
provide
care,
we
would
not
be
providing
such
conditions.
however,
as
to
the
question
of
habilitation,
we
don't
view
that
as
included
in
legitimate
state
interests
which
the
state
must
provide.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
not
at
all,
your
honor.
essentially
what--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--constitutionally,
he
may
well
decide
that
medical
care
includes
that
type
of
care,
and
under
those
circumstances
would
be--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
and,
you
know,
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--yes.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no.
what
we're
saying
is
that
medical
care
is
a
distinct
concept
from
providing
the
type
of
habilitative
services
or
maintenance
of
skill
services
which
the
third
circuit
provided
below.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
that
was
my
answer,
your
honor.
i
perhaps
should
have
qualified
it
by
saying
that
there
is
a
concept
of
habilitation
involved
in
psychiatric
care,
and
in
a
given
fact
situation,
habilitation
may
be
distinct
from
medical
care,
and
indeed
in
most
cases
can
be
separated.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
the
question
is--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--constitutionally,
i
can't
say
that
he's
mandated
to
provide
that
care.
while
we're
talking
about
questions
of
medical
judgments,
these
are
questions
that
are
better
resolved,
because
of
the
obvious
difference
in
experts
on
these
various
issues,
better
resolved
by
the
state
courts
under--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--care
i
would
define
as
food,
clothing,
shelter,
medical
care,
reasonable
safety,
whereas
habilitation,
the
definition
used
by
the
third
circuit,
is
that
education
and
training
required
for
the
mentally
retarded
to
reach
their
maximum
development.
to
the
extent
we're
getting
into
a
situation
where
we're
dealing
with
an
individual
who
is
mentally
ill,
which
is
the
question
as
to
psychiatric
care,
that
is
a
slightly
different
question,
and
that
case
is
not
before
the
court
today.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
treatment,
we
accept
that
definition.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
well,
constitutionally--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--it
may,
for
example,
in
a
medical
condition,
mean
improvement
from
having
a
broken
arm
to
having
the
arm
improve
to
the
point
it
was
usable.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
that
is
the
definition
used
by
the
court
below.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
not
necessarily.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
the
mentally
retarded
are
committed
either
because
they're
unable
to
care
for
themselves...
that
is
this
case,
and
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court
here...
unable--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--no.
unable
to
provide
for
their
daily
needs.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
it
may
be,
although
you
may
be
also
faced
with
a
situation
of
someone
who
is
physically
abusive
to
himself
as
opposed
to
an
individual
who
just
can't
provide
his
daily
needs.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
at
least
in
this
case
that's
the
case.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
that's
correct.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
it
could
provide
those
services
other
than
by
commitment.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
it
has
that
option.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
there
is
no
affirmative
obligation
to
provide
government
services.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
that's
correct.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
that's
correct.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no,
your
honor.
if
there's
no
chance
of
improvement--
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
--not
a
constitutional
obligation.
we
believe
those
decisions
should
be
left
to
legislators,
policymakers,
or
health
care
professionals.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
that
is
an
alternative,
although
we
also
have
the
option
of
continuing
to
provide
basic
human
needs,
humane
care.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
yes.
we
would
have
to
treat
them
so
long
as
they're
committed.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
no.
we
can
always
discharge
our
constitutional
obligation
by
releasing,
of
course
subject
to
the
court's
approval
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
court
ordered
commitment.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
allshouse
thank
you.
