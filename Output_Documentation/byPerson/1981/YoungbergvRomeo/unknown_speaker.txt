unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
a
body
of
medical
opinion
defining
what
is
the
appropriate
or
proper
medical
treatment
for
each
of
the
conditions
that
you're
dealing
with?
unknown
speaker
what
judge
aldus
referred
to
as
constitutional
buzz
words?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
all
these
things
as
a
matter
of
record
facts?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
have
been
better
off
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
position
had
you
let
the
case
go
back
and
be
tried
to
get
a
full
record
instead
of
coming
up
here
in
the
condition
in
which
it
is?
unknown
speaker
at
least
you're
asking
us
to
pass
on
this
case
without
a
developed
record.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allshouse,
under
that
standard...
oh,
excuse
me.
what
about
the
issue
of
immunity?
unknown
speaker
was
this
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
allshouse,
as
i
recall
from
reading
the
briefs,
there
was
some
testimony
excluded
by
the
trial
court
that
according
to
the
plaintiffs
and
the
court
below
would
have
been
testimony
on
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
restraints
that
were
used.
and
would
that
not
go
to
the
very
question
of
any
qualified
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
the
trier
of
fact
have
to
determine
that
after
listening
to
the
excluded
testimony?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
restraints?
as
i
understand
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us,
you
have
the
burden
not
only
of
persuading
us
that
judge
adams'
opinion
is
unsound
but
also
that
chief
judge
sites'
test
is
not
an
acceptable
test.
and
in
order
to
illustrate
the
difference
between
the
test
you
proposed
and
judge
sites'
test,
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
under
your
test
you
prevail
if
you
show
that
restraints
were
imposed
for
the
convenience
of
the
staff?
that's
all
you
have
to
show,
because
that's
rational.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not?
isn't
that
rational?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
to
be
more
than
just
purely
rational.
you
have
a
somewhat
higher
standard
than
mere
rationality
then.
and
if
you
do,
what
is
the
difference
between
your
test
and
judge
sites'
test?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
close
to
what
you're
getting
to
in
your
test,
though.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
we
should
probably
affirm
rather
than
reverse
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
jury
was
not
instructed
under
the
standard
that
you
now
propose,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
there
not
necessarily
going
to
be
a
new
trial
in
all
events?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
a
rational
relationship
to
the
two
acceptable
purposes,
either
one
of
the
acceptable
purposes.
unknown
speaker
to
protect
themselves
or
others.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
say...
as
you
said
to
justice
stevens,
it
just
wouldn't
be
just
any
purpose.
unknown
speaker
well,
convenience
of
staff
might
be
a
legitimate
state
interest,
but
you
put
that
aside.
you
say
it
has
to
be
a
different
one.
now,
that
certainly
is
beyond
the
rational
relationship.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
aren't
proposing
that,
though.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
concede
then
in
this
case
that
some
constitutional
rights
are
involved?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
liberty
interest.
there
are
liberty
interests
here?
unknown
speaker
the
state
must
have
a
good
enough
excuse
to
impose
restraint?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
the
right
to
treatment?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
the
state
wouldn't
need
to
treat
at
all.
they
would
just
need
to
care.
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
totally
wrong
in
saying
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
care...
i
mean
to
treatment.
unknown
speaker
but
you
concede
there
are
liberty
interests
involved
in
the
sense
of
restraint
and
protection.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
complaint
didn't
state
a
cause
of
action
with
respect
to
restraint
or
protection.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
to
be
tried
out.
unknown
speaker
what
was
that?
how
was
it
phrased?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
what
basis
could
they
appeal?
unknown
speaker
so
they
sort
of
treated
it
as
plain
error
in
a
sense.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
i
understand
your
position
then
that
with
respect
to
treatment
or
protection...
i
mean
with
respect
to
restraint
or
protection
that
yes,
the
state
must
have
a
good
enough
reason
to
restrain
or
to
fail
to
protect,
but
that
you
think
the
standard
is
that
any
acceptable
medical
judgment
should
be...
well,
any
fair
medical
judgment
or
any
honest
medical
judgment
ought
to
be
accepted?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
know
in
this
case
that
the
medical
judgments
were
made
in
terms
of
the
standard
which
you
now
embrace,
namely
the
protection
of
the
patient
or
protection
of
others?
unknown
speaker
rather
than
just
staff
convenience?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
case
wasn't
tried
on
your
standards,
so
why
should
we
attempt
to
examine
the
record
and
make
a
judgment
in
terms
of
your
standards
which
weren't
applied
in
the
trial
court
either?
unknown
speaker
that's
another
fact
bound
issue,
the
way
immunity
is
presently
administered.
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
some
court
does,
but
would
we?
would
you
really
ask
us
to
canvass
the
record?
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
we
took
your
standard,
we'd
at
least
remand
to
them
to
judge
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
i
understand
why...
i
may
not
agree
with
you,
but
i
understand
why
you
object
to
the
court
of
appeals
standards.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
correct
on
our
standards,
though,
why
shouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
then
deal
first
with
the
case
under
your
standards?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
they
do
it
rather
than
us
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
they're
told
what
the
standards
are.
unknown
speaker
is
mere
warehousing
then
a
standard
that
you
would
apply
for
those
who
are
committed
because
they
can't
care
for
themselves?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what
about
those
individuals
who
with
some
treatment
could
be
returned
to
the
community
and
provide
care
for
themselves,
is
there
an
obligation
in
those
instances
on
the
state
with
a
committed
patient
to
provide
that
treatment?
unknown
speaker
what
about
those
patients
who
are
committed
and
who
actually
regress
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
care
for
themselves
without
treatment
in
the
institution,
who
actually
get
worse?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
state
took
the
step
of
committing
that
individual,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
along
these
lines?
you
concede
an
obligation
to
provide
medical
care.
would
that
include
or
not
include
psychiatric
medical
care?
i
suppose
if
someone
acquired
pneumonia,
contracted
pneumonia,
medical
care
would
be
provided;
but
if
the
patient
had
severe
psychiatric
problems
would
that
sort
of
care
be
provided?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
there's
no
obligation
to
provide
psychiatric
care?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
this
case
suggests
that
certain
action
was
taken,
but
it
wasn't
psychiatric
care
action;
it
was
confining
the
individual.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
where
do
you
get
the
requirement
to
give
them
any
care?
unknown
speaker
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
what
part
of
the
constitution
draws
the
line
between
ordinary
medical
care
and
psychiatric
care?
unknown
speaker
no
provision,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you
put
yourself
over
and
above
the
doctors?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
doctor
says
the
medical
treatment
that
this
man
needs
is
psychiatric
treatment?
you
would
say
he
cannot
make
that
decision,
the
doctor.
your
doctor
can't
make
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
did,
would
you
honor
it?
unknown
speaker
if
he
did,
would
you
give
him
psychiatric
care?
unknown
speaker
you
would
provide
psychiatric
care.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
you
here
for?
you
just
said
you
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
justice
powell
asked
you
was
"psychiatric",
and
you
said,
"no",
i
thought,
but
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
doctor
says
this
man
is
a
danger
to
himself
and
to
his
fellow
people,
but
if
given
psychiatric
care
for
about
two
months
he
would
be
cured.
would
he
get
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
please
don't
add
anything
to
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
because
it
seems
to
be
critical
to
your
position,
how
would
you
best
phrase
the
distinction
between
care
and
treatment?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
meant
to
ask
you
in
the
context
of
the
mentally
retarded.
the
treatment
there
would
be...
you
would
define
treatment
as
attempting
to
enable
the
patient
to
attain
the
maximum
potential
that
he's
capable
of.
unknown
speaker
but
care
might
involve
some
improvement
in
the
mental
condition
of
the
patient.
you
wouldn't
deny
that,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
not
simply
status
quo.
unknown
speaker
but
the
obligation
to
treat
that
you
say
does
not
exist
is
an
obligation
to
enable
the
individual
to
achieve
his
maximum
potential.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
allshouse,
aren't
we
dealing
here
only
with,
or
are
we,
with
people
who've
been
involuntarily
committed?
unknown
speaker
and
aren't
we
therefore
by
definition
dealing
with
those
who
are
a
danger
to
themselves
or
to
others?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
mean
you
involuntarily
commit
people
for
other
reasons
in
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
unable
to
care
for
themselves?
you
mean
their
economics
or
their--
unknown
speaker
--well,
isn't
that
within
the
broad
definition
of
danger
to
themselves?
if
the
can't
take
care
of
themselves,
they're
dangerous
to
themselves.
unknown
speaker
they
will
expire
if
you
don't
do
something
with
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
you
nevertheless
are
dealing
with
people
who
in
the
end
would
not
survive
if
you
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--and
so
those
are
the
only
people
that
we're
really
focusing
on
here,
people
who,
broadly
speaking,
are
dangerous
to
themselves
or
others.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
suggest...
i
take
it
that
you
would
take
the
position
that
the
state
need
not
commit
these
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
must
it
provide
the
services?
could
it
just
say
we
do
not
commit
people
who
are
dangerous
to
themselves
or
to
others?
unknown
speaker
even
the
third
circuit
left
you
with
that,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
so
that
your
duty
arises
when
you
purport
involuntarily
to
hold
some
person,
to
commit
someone.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
this
question
now
to
get
back
where
i
opened
up
with
a
question
to
you.
the
key
is
whether
the
condition
is
treatable
in
the
first
place,
and
if
the
person
is
in
this
condition
of
unable
to
care
because
of
a
permanent
brain
damage,
for
example,
whether
from
disease
or
accident,
then
do
you
say
that
if
the
psychiatrists
determine
that
it
is
not
a
condition
that
can
be
improved
or
changed
by
treatment,
then
i
take
it
you
say
there
is
no
obligation
to
treat,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
now
determined
that
the
condition
is
treatable
with
some
prospect
of
improvement,
what
do
you
say
about
an
obligation
to
provide
treatment?
is
there
an
obligation
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i
say
if
there
is
a
chance,
if
the
psychiatrists
come
out
with
a
report
after
examination
and
say
this
can
be
improved,
then
is
there
an
obligation
to
treat?
unknown
speaker
the
alternative
then
would
be
if
they
say
we
haven't
the
facilities
to
treat,
so
we'll
turn
this
person
back
to
the
family
and
just
put
them
out
of
the
institution?
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
have
that
option
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
you
would
either
have
to
turn
them
loose
or
treat
them.
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals
majority
opinion
that
would
preclude
you
from
simply
discharging
the
patient,
saying
go
back
home.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
a
legislature
didn't
provide
the
resources,
the
budget
to
do
these
things,
then
you
might
be
up
against
sending
the
person
back
home.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
question
that
he
had
some
of
those
behavioral
patterns
himself?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
solve
your
problem,
your
client's
problem,
if
the
state
said
you're
discharged,
go
somewhere
else.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
you
contend
then
that
he
is
treatable
and
curable.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tiryak,
was
this
an
action
just
for
damages
in
view
of
the
jury
trial,
or
was
it
also
an
action
for
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
it
not
be
something
of
a
pyrrhic
victory
that
you
won
in
the
third
circuit
if
the
state,
as
everybody
appears
to
concede,
is
free
if
it
does
not
wish
to
provide
treatment
to
simply
release
the
person?
unknown
speaker
so
you
view
it
basically
as
a
damage
action
on
behalf
of
your
client.
unknown
speaker
are
you
also
relying
on
the
state
constitution
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
he
confined
for
the
purpose
of
treatment
or
confined
for
the
purpose
of
protection?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
can
do
it
for
either,
but
your
client
was...
is
there
any
definition
in
this
record
as
to
why
he
was
committed?
unknown
speaker
but
if
your
client
was
committed
just
for
treatment,
he
could
get
out.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest
that...
do
you
think
that
pennsylvania
is
insisting
that
under
the
constitution
it
may
commit
people
involuntarily
simply
because
they
would
benefit
from
treatment?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
don't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
your
client
would
be
constitutionally
entitled
to
release?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you
concede
the
state
may
keep
him
there
as
long
as
they
live
up
to
what
you
think
their
obligations
are.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
a
statutory
claim
for
violation
of
the
state
statute
and
not
providing
treatment?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
have
you
made
a
claim
that
that
statute's
been
violated
by
these
defendants?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
view
that
whatever
the
statute
may
provide,
it
provides
everything
that
you
say
constitutionally
you're
also
entitled
to?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
have
a
statutory
claim
then?
why
didn't
you
allege
one?
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
mills
v.
rogers
from
the
first
circuit
which
is
going
to
be
argued
wednesday?
unknown
speaker
there,
there
seemed
to
be
no
question
in
the
mind
of
the
first
circuit
that
the
public
officials
involved
were
entitled
to
immunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
keep
talking
about
the
one
issue,
physical
safety,
but
there
are
two
other
items.
one
is
restraint,
and
the
other
is
treatment.
now,
you
wouldn't
suggest
at
the
time
of
these
events
that
the
constitutional
right
to
treatment
in
a
context
like
this
had
been
clearly
enunciated?
unknown
speaker
under
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
they
never
have
been
decided
here.
unknown
speaker
and
was
there
some
clearly
enunciated
constitutional
right
not
to
be
restrained
in
a
context
like
this?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
deal
with
involuntarily
committed
people,
though.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
deal
with
involuntarily
committed
people.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
have
a
patient,
an
inmate
who,
so
the
behavioral
experts
decide,
can
be
restrained
from
hurting
himself
or
other
people
only
by
being
kept
under
constant
restraint
or
constant
tranquilizers
or
both?
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
staff
convenience
do
you
mean
so
the
staff
can
go
out
and
play
golf,
or
do
you
mean
by
convenience
the
maintenance
of
an
orderly
medical
institution?
unknown
speaker
that's
because
a
district
court
tried
it
on
an
eighth
amendment
theory
and
excluded
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
go
ahead
with
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
finish
your
answer
to
the
chief--
unknown
speaker
--what
you're
just
saying
is
not
consistent
with
what
the
majority
opinion
in
the
third
circuit
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
got
much
more
out
of
the
third
circuit
than
you
ever
asked
the
district
court
to
instruct
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
is
you
just
lost
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't...
were
some
of
your
instructions
turned
down,
a
lot
of
critical
ones?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
you
took
the
least
restrictive
alternative
approach,
precisely
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
by
that
do
you
mean
they
were
illegal
in
the
sense
that
they
were
more
than
were
necessary?
unknown
speaker
necessary
in
the
eyes
of
whom?
unknown
speaker
so
that
every
time
someone
is
involuntarily
committed
and
subject
to
restraints,
the
person
who
authorizes
the
restraints
is
subjecting
himself
to
possible
damage
recovery.
unknown
speaker
but
since
it's
ultimately
a
jury
question,
presumably
there
will
be
numerous
differences
of
opinion,
and
if
you
can
find
an
expert
witness
who
will
support
you,
it
could
be
in
any
number
of
other
contexts,
too.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
no
medical
reason?
what
if
the
reason
is
they
want
to
protect
him
from
harming
himself
and
harming
others?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
medical
reason?
unknown
speaker
well,
doctors
did
the
confining,
didn't
they?
it
was
on
doctors'
orders.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes,
it
was
on
medical
orders.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you--
--i
still
have
great
problem
with
this
medical.
if
a
guy
beats
up
on
anybody
he
sees
24
hours
a
day,
is
it
a
medical
decision
to
restrain
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
suggest
that
you
not
try
it
and
wait
for
a
medical
person
to
protect
you.
i
mean
any
imprisoned
person
can
be
decided
to
need
restraint
and
it's
not
medical.
i
don't
see
why
you
keep
stressing
medical.
what's
the
magic
of
medical,
the
word
"medical"?
unknown
speaker
because
you
keep
saying
they're
denied
medical
treatment.
is
it
they
are
denied
or
that
they're
not
given?
you
know,
they're
two
different
things.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
if
you
don't
need
medical
treatment,
you're
not
denied
it,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
that
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
training
is
a
component
of
care.
your
opponent
says
that
there's
no
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
treatment
in
the
sense
of
achieving
the
person's
maximum
potential.
do
you
contend
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
treatment
that
would
enable
your
client
to
achieve
his
maximum
potential?
unknown
speaker
do
you
really
differ
between
the
two
of
you
on
what
the
constitutional
right
at
stake
is?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
parties
in
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that's
a
part
of
the
minimum
care
that's
required.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
he
disagrees
with
you.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
be
hurt
then,
i
suppose,
or
you
wouldn't
have
standing
to
object
if
they
simply
isolated
your
person
from
dangerous
people.
if
they
protected
him
anyway
from
harm
and
successfully
did
so,
you
couldn't
complain
that
they
weren't
treating
other
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
treatment,
the
maximum
potential
business,
you're
not
defending
the
third
circuit.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way.
if
the
third
circuit
announced
a
right
to
treatment
in
the
sense
of
treatment
to
achieve
maximum
potential,
if
that's
what
they
said,
you
don't
defend
that.
you
may
agree
with
it--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
they
did,
i
take
it
you
do
not
defend
that.
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
you
don't
press
it
here.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
more
judge
sites
than
the
majority?
unknown
speaker
on
restraint?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
on
treatment.
unknown
speaker
including
me,
apparently.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
have
a
tri
level
arrangement.
unknown
speaker
they
have
one
standard
for
restraint,
another
standard
for
protection,
and
still
another
one
for
treatment.
unknown
speaker
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
concrete,
i
hope
concrete
hypothetical
which
may
bear
on
it.
suppose,
taking
the
record
of
what
this
man's
past
shows,
that
he
injured
himself
before
he
was
ever
confined,
he
injured
himself
after
he
was
in
custody,
he
injured
other
people,
and
finally
the
attendants
draw
this
all
to
the
attention
of
one
of
the
psychiatrists,
and
the
psychiatrist
looking
it
over
says
on
this
record
there's
only
one
thing
to
do
and
that's
restrain
this
fellow.
and
so
he
enters
an
order
that
he's
to
be
placed
under
regular
full
time
restraint
so
as
not
to
injure
himself
or
others.
now,
what
kind
of
immunity
or
qualified
immunity
does
the
doctor
have
for
that
good
faith
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
know
in
the
abstract.
unknown
speaker
the
doctor
has
said
they
are
necessary,
and
he's
trained
and
that's
his
field
and
there's
nothing
in
it
for
him.
he's
exercised
his
best
medical
judgment
in
that
hypothetical,
that
he
must
be
restrained.
now,
can
he
be
held
liable
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
fully
aware
of
what
they
held,
so
i'm
not
sure
he
could
be.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
not
how
a
jury
would
react.
what
is
this
doctor's
liability
and
responsibility.
does
he
have
to
call
a
lawyer
first
and
say
here's
what
i'm
going
to
do;
what
will
happen
to
me
in
a
damage
suit
if
somebody
brings
a
damage
suit
for
restricting
this
man's
liberty?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
has
made
sure.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
about
that.
he's
made
the
judgment
in
terms
of
these
standards,
but
there
is
testimony
offered
by
you
that
they
weren't
necessary
at
all,
and
another
doctor
has
said
of
course
they
weren't
necessary.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
question
that
you
could
always
get
a
psychiatrist
to
testify
to
the
contrary,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it's
a
reality?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it's
a
reality?
unknown
speaker
well,
having
reviewed
hundreds
of
records
in
thirteen
years
on
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
a
constant
pattern
in
every
criminal
case
with
the
defense
asserted
that
one
psychiatrist
would
say
it's
black,
and
the
other
would
say
it's
white.
unknown
speaker
but
he's
dependent
upon
what
a
jury
would
decide
between
these
two
psychiatrists
then.
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
safe
thing
for
this
psychiatrist
to
do
would
be
to
enter
an
order
that
there's
nothing
more
we
can
do
for
this
man
here,
i
order
him
released.
is
that
a
solution
to
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
then
if
he
goes
out
and
injures
somebody
after
that
release,
then
the
doctor
is
going
to
be
sued
for
having
released
him.
he
also
has
a
little
trouble
with
the
hippocratic
oath,
too,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
suggested
jury
instructions
that
are
appended
to
its
opinion.
do
you
approve
of
all
three
of
those?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
in
at
least
two
of
the
three
instructions
the
language
used
refers
to
the
need
for
showing
compelling
reasons
and
for
employing
least
restrictive
means.
are
they
standards
you
urge
us
to
accept?
unknown
speaker
in
the
context
of
what?
unknown
speaker
it's
also
used
in
connection
with
shackling
and
with
failure
to
provide
care.
unknown
speaker
but
returning
to
my
question,
just
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
position,
if
we
remand
the
case,
for
example,
suppose
we
just
remand
it
because
there
has
been
no
jury
trial,
would
you
urge
the
three
instructions
on
the
district
court
that
have
been
suggested
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
would
approve
of
the
use
of
the
language
compelling
need
and
least
restrictive
means?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
what
your
standards
would
be.
this
is
a
difficult
question
in
the
case
for
me.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
necessary.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
that
standard?
unknown
speaker
well
i
thought
you
said
some
time
ago
in
your
argument
that
your
approach
in
the
trial
court
or
your
submission
that
you
took
the
least
restrictive
alternative
approach.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
say
you
retreat
from
them
and
you
take
the
necessity
standard,
is
that
it?
it
seems
to
me
like
you've...
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
with
respect
to
what
did
you
tell
justice
powell
that
the
least
restrictive,
least
intrusive
approach
was
not
constitutionally
required,
or
at
least
you
weren't
pressing
it?
with
respect
to
what?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you're
quite
right.
