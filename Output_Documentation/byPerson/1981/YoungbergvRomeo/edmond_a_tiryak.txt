mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
central
controversy
in
this
case
arises
around
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
at
all
a
distinction
or
at
least
is
there
always
a
distinction
between
care
and
treatment.
we
reject
the
concept,
and
we
believe
the
facts
of
this
case
can
show
that
it's
impossible
in
all
cases
to
provide
decent
care
without
providing
some
habilitation.
example:
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
respondent
was
injured
on
77
occasions
in
a
two
year
period
while
confined
at
pennhurst.
he
was
confined
with
people
who
were
confined
because
they
had
behavioral
patterns
which
made
them
aggressive.
thus,
these
same--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--your
honor,
there
was
a
major
factual
dispute
about
exactly
how
aggressive
my
client
was,
and
our
contention...
part
of
our
contention
was
that
it'd
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
live
in
the
conditions
he
was
confined
under
without
developing
some
aggressive
patterns.
it
was
a
very
hotly
disputed
issue
at
trial
and
something
that
the
jury
would
ultimately
have
to--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--no,
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
solve
our
problem
because--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--because
he
needs...
precisely
because
he
needs
habilitation.
he
was
committed
under
state
law
because
of
his
inability
to
care
for
himself
and
because
he
needed
treatment,
and
that
finding
by
the
court--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well,
he
will
never
become
a
person
who
is
not
retarded,
your
honor.
he
can
learn
skills.
he
can
learn
not
to
be
violent.
and
our
testimony,
for
example,
which
was
excluded
by
the
district
court...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
excluded
all
of
our
expert
testimony...
but
our
testimony
would
have
showed
that
had
they
used
programs
that
they
had
available
at
pennhurst
that
the
violence
on
his
ward,
the
aggression
of
the
patients
would
have
been
diminished
or
eliminated.
now,
the
question
i
have
is
is
that
care
or
is
that
treatment?
if
my
client
is
injured
repeatedly
by
aggressive
people
who
are
not
receiving
habilitation,
and
if
i
can
show
to
the
jury
with
my
expert
testimony
that
that
would
have
happened,
and
if
they
had
the
resources
available
to
do
that,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
question
is
just
as
much
a
question
of
right
to
decent
care
as
it
is
right
to
decent
treatment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
your
honor,
at
this
posture
it's
just
an
action
for
damages.
at
the
district
court
stage
we
filed
preliminary
injunctive
relief
asking
the
court
to
transfer
him
to
another
institution.
the
district
court...
it's
not
in
the
record...
the
district
court--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--no.
it's
not
before
you.
just
simply
a
damage
action
before
you.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
if
the
state
were
to
make
a
decision
not
to
confine
people
at
pennhurst
under
the
conditions
that
they're
being
confined
in,
it
could...
that's
a
political
question,
and
that's
a
legislative
question,
and
that's
something
that
will
be
fought
in
a
different
forum.
put
my
client
was
injured.
he
was
injured
very
seriously
during
his
stay
at
pennhurst.
and
if
we
recover
damages,
we'll
have
other
resources
with
which
to
provide
him
treatment.
so
it's
not
simply
a
question
of
what--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--yes.
that's
the
way
we
view
it.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
our
position
is...
the
second
point.
i'd
like
to
make
besides
the
fact
that
care
and
treatment
are
the
same
thing
when
we're
talking
about
confining
people
who
can't
take
care
of
themselves,
we
believe
that
when
states
confine
people
under
state
law
for
the
purpose
of
treatment,
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
that
they
receive
some
amount
of
treatment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
the
statute
says
care
and
treatment,
your
honor.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
if
you're
talking
about
as
a
matter
of
fact
why
he
personally
was
committed,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
decision
by
the
state
court.
however,
we've
provided
for
you
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
under
which
he
was
committed,
which
demonstrates
quite
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
that
statutory
provision
was
to
provide
people
with
treatment.
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation...
this
is
in
footnote
29
of
our
brief...
saying
if
we
pass
this
statute
we'll
now
know
that
everybody
in
our
state
schools
and
hospitals--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--i'm
sorry,
but--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--no,
no.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
statute
says
he
was
committed
for
the
purpose
of
care
and
treatment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
in
the
sense
that
he
could
not
take
care
of
himself
or
with
the
held
of
his
friends?
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
no,
no.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
procedural
challenge
to
his
commitment
or
a
challenge
to
the
state's
ability
to
commit
people.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
we
believe
there's
a
right
to
treatment
under
the
state
law.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
indirectly
through...
we
don't
have
a
pendant
state
claim,
no.
our
claim
is
that
that
statute
creates
a
due
process
liberty
interest
in
treatment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
yes,
yes.
and
we
believe
that
the
state's--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--simply
because
the
immunity
situation
under
state
law
in
pennsylvania
was
extremely...
it's
different
now,
but
at
the
time
we
filed
this
case,
petitioner
youngberg,
for
example,
was
absolutely
immune
from
damages
under
an
offshoot
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
that
has
since
changed,
but
only
after
a
large
portion
of
our
claims
would
have
expired
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
problem.
so
we
couldn't
get
relief
from
the
state
court,
and
we
couldn't
get
relief
in
damages
from
the
state
court.
we
couldn't
get
relief
with
a
pendant
state
claim,
but
we
believe
that
we
can
get
relief
from
this
court
without
facing
the
question
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
and
of
itself
requires
states
to
do
these
things.
we
believe
this
court
has
in
the
past
and
should
in
this
case
say
if
you
confine
somebody
for
care
and
treatment,
if
that's
your
stated
purpose,
then
you
must
give
them
some...
there
must
be
some
reasonable
relationship
between
your
purpose
in
the
commitment
and
the
nature
of
the
commitment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
i
read
the
opinions,
yes.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
you
know,
the
facts
will
differ
in
different
situations.
here,
we
had
a
situation
where
someone
is
a
superintendent
of
a
facility.
he
is
a
repeatedly
informed
by
outside
officials
that
a
particular
resident
is
being
physically
abused.
we
have
expert
testimony
that
he
had
at
his
disposal
the
means
to
prevent
it
from
occurring
and
failed
to
do
it.
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
struck
me
as
a
very
different
situation
than
in
rogers,
because
in
rogers
at
least
the
official
could
day
i
didn't
know
that
i
couldn't
provide
you
with
this
medication
to
begin
with.
here,
the
petitioners
don't
claim
that
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
physical
safety
while
he
was
committed
to
pennhurst.
so
i
don't
see
good
faith
immunity
as
something
that
could
be
decided
by
the
court.
i
could
see
the
jury
concluding
good
faith.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
there
were
a
number
of--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--there
were
a
number
of
court
decisions
that
we
cite
for
you
in
the
brief
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
no,
but
this
court
has
never
held,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
do,
that
this
court
would
have
to
make
a
ruling
on
point
for
the
good
faith
immunity
to
get
to
the
point
of
being
a
jury
question.
i
mean
that
would
basically
take
away
the
damage
remedy
in
civil
rights
actions.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
this
court
in
the
ingraham
case
referred
to
freedom
of
bodily
movement
as
being
an
historic
liberty
interest
recognized
from
colonial
days.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
pardon
me?
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
that's
true,
but
it
seems
to
me
as
judge
adams
below
notes,
freedom
of
bodily
movement
was
probably
the
most
traditional
concept
in
terms
of
what
liberty
meant
in
due
process
from
colonial
times
until
today.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
we
believe
that
if
restraints
are
necessary
to
protect
the
patient
or
to
protect
others
or
to
maintain
the
type
of
institutional
order
that's
necessary
to
provide
treatment,
then
they're
justified.
what
we
have
here,
what
we
sought
to
prove
here
was
not
that
but
that
our
client
was
restrained
for
virtually
all
his
waking
hours
for
a
period
of
over
a
year,
and
our
expert
was
prepared
to
say
that
there
was
no
medical
reason
for
this
but
it
was
for
staff
convenience.
now,
that--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well,
i
can
tell
you
what
i
mean.
unfortunately,
the
record...
you
know,
the
expert
never
got
to
testify,
and
all
we
have
is
my
proffer
of
proof.
so
the
record
really
doesn't
find
that--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well,
your
honor,
even
if
an
eighth
amendment
standard
would
be
used
in
the
district
court's
decision,
we
think
it's
wrong.
in
the
estelle
case
you
would
still
be
able
to
use
expert
testimony--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
oh,
i'm
sorry.
our
feeling
is,
your
honor,
is
that
all
we
wanted
to
do
is
be
able
to
show
a
jury
evidence
which
we
believe
would
take
this
case
away
from
a
situation
where
a
doctor
was
making
a
reasoned
medical
choice
to
put
somebody
in
restraints
for
a
legitimate
reason.
i
don't
think
we
disagree
on
what
the
legitimate
reasons
are.
we're
claiming
abuse
here.
we
think
that
repeated
daily,
hourly,
yearly
restraint
of
an
individual
in
the
absence
of
providing
treatment
when
unnecessary,
and
if
we
can
convince
a
jury
that
that
was
unnecessary,
that's
sheer
abuse,
so
it's
not
a
question
of
differing
medical
judgments.
we
concede
that
psychologists
can
use
restraints
as
part
of
behavior
modification
programs.
we
want
programming
for
our
clients.
any
retarded
person
would
not
want
to
be
in
a
restraint,
so
if
we
had
a
retarded
person
who
had
an
aggressive
tendency,
we
could
design
a
program
to
restrain
him
for
a
minute
or
two
minutes
each
time--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well,
i
recognize
that
there
is
some
unclarity
there.
this
case
revolves
around
a
complaint
about
abuse
with
restraints.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said...
we
believe
in
that
context
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct...
that
mental
retardation
professionals
have
eliminated
that
as
a
reasonable
thing.
and
indeed,
the
amici
that
have
come
in
here
to
this
court
from
many
professional
associations
have
indicated
that
you
can
abuse
people
with
restraints.
it's
not
always--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--i'm
not
sure
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
instructed--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--yes.
the
district
court
would
not
instruct
the
jury
that
we
had
a
right
to
treatment
in
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
we
took
a
least
restrictive
alternative
approach
to
this
case.
the
district
court
denied
that
approach,
and
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
our
treatment
claim
said
that
we
were
wrong.
we're
not
contesting
that
on
this
appeal.
we
accept
that
decision,
and
we
accept
their
definition
of
treatment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
okay.
i'm
sorry.
we
are
claiming
that
the
restraints
were
illegal,
and
we
wanted
a
jury
instruction
to
show
that
the
restraints
were
illegal
unless
it
was
the
least
restrictive
means
of
dealing
with
whatever
problem
they
were
trying
to
solve
with
the--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--that
is
a
definition
of
least
restrictive
alternative.
my
own
feeling
is
that
there
are
so
many
definitions
of
least
restrictive
alternative
at
this
point
that
it's
difficult
to
separate
them
out.
so
we've
just
basically
accepted
the
court
of
appeals
position,
which
is
restraints
are
legal
if
they're
necessary.
this
is
in
the
context
of
these
restraints,
not
a
behavior
modification
program.
a
behavior
modification
program
it
would
seem
to
me
would
fall
under
an
entirely
different
review
in
terms
of
what
treatment
is
appropriate.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
it
would
be
a
jury
question,
your
honor.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
in
the
context
we
have
here,
the
facts
here
deal
with
long
term
custodial
use
of
restraints.
in
that
situation
i
think
the
answer
is
appropriately
yes.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
the
law
could
expand
beyond
this
point.
but
it
seems
to
me
here
we're
talking
about...
all
we're
seeking
to
do
is
show
that
somebody
was
restrained
for
over
a
year
for
no
medical
reason.
we
had
evidence
that
was
excluded
to
that
effect.
now,
if
we
can't
convince
a
jury
of
that,
it
seems
to
me
then
we
would
lose.
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
imply
that
a
short
term
restraint
necessary
would
be
even
encompassed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
i--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--i
consider
that
a
medical
reason.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
the
mechanism
that
was
used
was
the
nurses
would
observe
my
client
and
make
telephone
calls
to
a
doctor
who
would
issue
an
order
for--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--okay.
in
that
sense,
yes.
however,
petitioner
youngberg
has
a
duty
under
state
law,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noticed,
to
prevent
people
in
his
institution
from
being
restrained
unless
absolutely
necessary.
it's
not
under
pennsylvania
law
viewed
as
necessarily
a
medical
judgment.
it's
a
judgment
that
the
superintendent
of
facility
is
required
to
make
about
use
of
restraints.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
i
would
say
yes,
if
you're
in
a
hospital
that
would
be
a
medical
decision.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
i
think
you're
probably
right,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
there
is
a
magic
to
that
term.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
could
i
answer--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--that's
correct.
certainly
if
you
don't
need
it,
you
wouldn't
be
denied
that.
but
for
example,
let's...
this
gets
back
to
the
question
of
care
and
treatment.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
my
client
confined
in
a
ward
under
state
law
where
the
residents
aren't
toilet
trained.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
they're
there
is
because
they
don't
have
those
type
of
skills.
they
are
not
given
any
toilet
training,
no
rehabilitation
to
learn
how
to
do
that.
as
a
result,
his
injuries,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
became
infected
from
feces
that
were
on
the
ward.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
his
need
for
decent
care
in
that
situation
has
to
encompass
at
least
some
duty
on
the
part
of
petitioners
to
eliminate
the
cause
of
the
filth
on
the
ward.
and
that
can
be
done
in
one
way
through
rehabilitation.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
no.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
yes.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
the
difference
is
that
our
feeling
is
that
petitioners
are
obligated
to
use
behavioral
programming
to
prevent
violent
people...
to
reduce
violence
and
prevent
aggressive--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--that's
right.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
okay.
i
would
consider
that
a
step
forward.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
that's
one
of
the
things
they
could
do.
there
are
others,
other
things.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
i
think
the
third
circuit's
opinion
has
been
very
seriously--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--no.
i
don't
think
that's
what
they
said.
i
think
what
the
third
circuit--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--no.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
i
don't
think
it's
this
case.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
get
that
far.
i
think
the
third
circuit
ruled
with
respect
to
habilitation.
basically
it
just
rephrased
jackson
v.
indiana.
it
said
if
they
can
show
a
coherent
relationship
between
the
treatment
given
and
what
his
needs
are,
then
they're
not
liable.
in
jackson
v.
indiana
this
court
unanimously
ruled
that
there
had
to
be
some
reasonable
relationship
between
the
purpose
and
the
commitment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
no.
that's
the
majority
opinion.
see,
what
happens
in
this
case--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--no.
this
is
treatment.
we're
on
treatment.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
everybody
keeps
looking
at
the
first
sentence.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--that
treatment
be
acceptable
in
light
of
present
knowledge.
but
if
you
go
on--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--they
define
what
acceptable
is,
and
that
is--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--pardon?
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
appropriate.
i
think
if
we're
talking
about
the
medical
use
of
restraints
by
psychologists,
that's
part
of
a
treatment
program
which
we
would
want.
it
would
be
reasonable
to
look
at
the
habilitation
standards.
but
if
we're
talking
about
just
having
somebody
bound
because
he's
less
trouble
that
way,
i
don't
view
that
as
something
we'd
view
as
a--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--we
believe
that
if
the
restraints
are
necessary,
then
they're
legal,
and
we
don't
need--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--oh,
i
see.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
i
assume
the
doctor
is
aware
of
the
third
circuit
opinion,
so
he
doesn't
have
a
good
faith
immunity.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
you're
asking
me
to
say
how
a
jury
would
react
to
that.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
advice
i
would
give
him
would
be
that
if
you're
going
to
use
restraints
on
somebody
not
as
part
of
a
treatment
program,
then
make
sure
that
they're
necessary.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
then
he
has
no
fear
of
liability
under
our
theory.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
correct.
and
then
a
jury
would
decide.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
i
would.
i
think
that's
sort
of
a
standard
joke
around
these
days,
your
honor,
but
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
psychiatric
community.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
pardon
me?
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there
are
often
situations
where
psychiatrists
differ,
but
i
don't
think
you
could
always
get
a
psychiatrist--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well,
you
bring
more
into
this
than
i
do,
your
honor.
i
can't
say
i
have
that
much
experience.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
if
he
wants
to
restrain
people
for
long
periods
of
time
as
we
have
here...
to
rule
in
our
favor
here
we're
not
talking
about
short
term
emergency
situations.
the
court
of
appeals
mentions
that.
we're
talking
about
long
term,
protracted,
daily
use
of
restraints
not
for
a
treatment
purpose.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
it
might
be
a
solution
to
the
problem
for
the
doctor.
i
doubt
a
doctor
would
do
that.
you
know,
we
have
our
duties
as
lawyers;
doctors
have
theirs
as
doctors.
and
i
don't
think
doctors
would--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--yes.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
well,
first
of
all
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
they
didn't
command
the
district
court
to
use
these
instructions.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
in
this
case
the
trial
court
was
in
need
of
some
assistance
in
formulating
jury
instructions.
our
standards
differ
slightly.
we've
noted
the
standard
we
have
in
our
belief.
for
example,
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
requires
habilitation
for
all
retarded
people.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
the
least
restrictive
standard
used
in
the
context
of
prefrontal
lobotomies
is--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--lobotomies,
psychosurgery
when
they
operate
on
your
brain,
is--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well,
your
honor,
it
was
an
alternative
ground.
our
feeling
is
that
the
primary
ground
on
restraints
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
was
the
correct
one,
the
necessity
standard,
or
they
talk
about
essential,
but
we
think
a
necessity--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would...
i
think
that
this
is
what
we
have
been
bound
by
the
opinion,
so
i'm
not
sure
it
would
make
much
difference
what
we--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--i'm
sorry.
i
realize
i'm
being
confusing
to
you,
your
honor.
i
apologize
for
doing
so.
let
me
try
to--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--we
don't
feel
as
though
the
least
intrusive
standard
is
a
standard
that
is
necessary
to
be
used
to
decide
this
case.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
used
that
standard,
we
don't
feel
it's
necessary.
we
accept
the
fact
that--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--yes.
it's
unnecessary
to
decide
the
case,
to
get
to
those
issues.
and
we
haven't
urged
them
in
our
brief.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
in
the
abstract...
if
you
say
something
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative
that
is
necessary
to
resolve
the
need...
for
example,
restraints...
to
say
that
there
are
lesser
restrictive
standards
that
are
available
is
another
way
of
saying
that
the
restraints
would
be
necessary.
so
if
you
look
at
least
restrictive
alternative
in
the
appropriate
way,
we
believe
that
it
comes
out
to
mean
necessary.
the
problem
is
that
least
restrictive
alternative
is
a
standard
that
can
be
looked
at
and
has
been
looked
at
by
courts
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
and
is
susceptible
to
a
variety
of
different
interpretations.
that's
the
problem
we
have
with
the
standard,
and
that's
the
reason
we've
just
retreated,
shall
we
say,
into
the
necessary
standard
because
of
that's
appropriate.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
yes,
we
did.
we
asked
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
treatment
claims
to
find
there
was
a
least
restrictive
alternative,
and
we
lost
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
--the
problem
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
least
restrictive
in
three
different
situations,
okay.
the
first,
in
a
treatment
claim,
is
dicta
as
far
as
we're
concerned
because
those
claims...
the
situation
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
can
use
the
least
restrictive
alternative,
like
involuntary
sterilizations,
are
situations
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
in
the
general
right
to
treatment
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
is
no
right
to
least
restrictive
alternative.
they
said
that
using
a
least
restrictive
alternative
approach
in
day
to
day
treatment
decisions
would
be
a
mess
because
they...
so
we
lost
there.
mr.
edmond
a.
tiryak
okay.
so
on
that
part
of
it
we
accept
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
we'll
take
their
standard
on
that.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
also
as
an
alternate
holding
on
the
shackling
claim
used
least
restrictive
alternative
after
their
primary
holding,
which
is
shackles,
custodial
shackles,
would
be
necessary...
would
be
illegal
if
they
weren't
necessary.
now,
in
that
situation
with
restraints
we
like
the
necessary
standard.
we
think
it's
a
clarification
in
a
sense
of
the
least
restrictive
alternative
standard.
it's
sort
of
a
mess,
i
agree.
