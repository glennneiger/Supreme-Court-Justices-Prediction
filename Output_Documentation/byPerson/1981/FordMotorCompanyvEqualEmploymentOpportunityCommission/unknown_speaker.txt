unknown
speaker
did
that
coincide
with
the
filing
of
charges?
unknown
speaker
how
long
after?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
saying
that
when
the
offer
of
reinstatement
was
made,
it
was
rejected
out
of
hand?
unknown
speaker
with
no
conditions--
unknown
speaker
--except
that
the
employees
said
they
wouldn't
come
back
unless.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
got
the
implication
that
you
were...
at
least
an
intimation
that
the
employees
were
attaching
conditions.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wester,
is
it
clear
what
the
salary,
the
wage
rate
that
was
offered
was?
was
it
what
would
have
been
paid
when
they
were
originally
denied
employment,
or
was
it
the
current
wage
rate?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
wage
rate
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
1971?
unknown
speaker
and
the
government
gives
us
a
hypothetical
in
their
brief...
pardon
me--
unknown
speaker
--but
we
don't
know
whether
it
fits
this
case
or
not.
unknown
speaker
they
weren't
offered
the
seniority
they
would
have
had
if
they
had
been
hired
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
had
been
there
that
long,
would
they
have
not
only
seniority,
but
would
they
have
had
higher
wages?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
had
been
hired,
if
they
had
been
hired
when
they
were
turned
down,
when
they
weren't
hired,
when
they
were
allegedly
turned
down,
would
they
have
been
making
higher
rates
in
1973
than
new
employees
would
make?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wester,
is
it
your
position
that
the
claims
for
both
women
should
be
tolled,
even
though
only
one
job
was
available?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
not
have
been
undermined
had
there
been
no
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
the
offer
is
made
later.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
the
way
we
have
to
accept
this
case,
as
though
there
was
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
would
you
take
the
same
legal
position
if
there
had
been
a
finding
but
you
were
appealing
it?
unknown
speaker
you
would
still
say
that
notwithstanding
the
finding,
as
long
as
you
make
an
offer,
that
would
cut
off
back
pay
from
the
date
of
the
offer?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
how
would
that
affect
the
seniority
of
incumbent
employees,
mr.
wester,
if
you
simply
hired
people?
don't
you
have
to
hire
them
with
kind
of
advanced
seniority?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wester--
unknown
speaker
--i
am
still
confused.
are
you
saying
that
this
record
does
not
show
a
finding
of
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
here?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
avoid
that?
i
mean,
you
are
hung
with
that
finding,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
offer
seniority.
unknown
speaker
which
means
that
the
complainants
are
not
made
whole.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
they
could
continue
litigating
it.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is,
in
effect,
that
eventually
these
claims
will
be
resolved
by
a
court,
and
the
court
will
decide
what
things
in
addition
to
employment,
back
pay,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
if
anything,
the
successful
plaintiff
should
get,
but
that
the
employer
before
that
sort
of
a
determination
is
made
or
before
a
finding
of
discrimination
is
made,
the
employer
should
have
some
way
of
limiting
the
back
pay
liability
when
he
does
not
know
what
the
outcome
of
the
lawsuit
will
be.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
have
trouble
with
your
unconditional
offer
which
denies
seniority
status.
unconditional,
and
denied.
is
there
any
tension
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
had
offered
her
a
job
at
half
the
salary.
would
that
be
good?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
offered
them
a
job
with
half
of
their
seniority.
would
that
be
good?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
offered
it
with
no
seniority.
unknown
speaker
which
is
worse.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
to
give
somebody
full
seniority
hurts
them?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
also
require
them
to
pay
some
money,
too.
unknown
speaker
that
to
my
mind
is
not
an
unconditional
offer.
unknown
speaker
to
the
contrary,
it
is
a
conditioned
offer.
unknown
speaker
we
will
give
you
a
job
provided
you
waive
your
seniority.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
they
could
still
litigate
that
either
in
the
courts
or
by
arbitration
proceedings
if
there
were
arbitration
proceedings
available?
unknown
speaker
could
they
also
litigate
the
health
benefits
and
all
those
other
things?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
say
is,
we
will
give
you
a
piece
of
it
and
you
can
litigate
for
the
rest
of
it.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
in
the
world
could
you
stop
them
from
litigating?
do
you
control
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
love
this
very
generous
offer
that
ford
says,
you
are
free
to
go
to
court.
they
were
already
in
court.
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
you
haven't
given
up
anything.
unknown
speaker
nor
did
they
give
up
anything.
unknown
speaker
did
they
give
up
their
claim
for
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
involved?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
were
you
settling?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
settle?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
offer
for
settlement?
the
job.
unknown
speaker
the
bare
bones
job.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wester,
is
it
fair
to
state
that...
you
describe
the
offer
as
being
one
that
said,
you
can
have
the
job
plus
whatever
back
pay
and
seniority
is
determined
to
be
available
in
litigation.
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't
have
to
offer...
the
government
says
the
correct
offer
would
have
been
the
job
plus
seniority
plus
whatever
back
pay
may
be
found
to
be
due
in
litigation.
you
both
contemplated
further
litigation
of
one
or
the
other
issue.
you
just
say
there
are
two
issues.
they
say
there
is
one
that
had
to
be
litigated.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
difference.
nobody
thinks
it
settled
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
an
unconditional
settlement?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--that's
right.
it
is
not
even
a
settlement.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
was
any
request
made
by
either
one
of
these
ladies
for
seniority
rights
or
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
none
whatever.
unknown
speaker
while
i
am
asking
you
a
question,
was
there
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
effect
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
and
what
about
seniority
rights
being
given
in
light
of
the
provisions
of
it?
unknown
speaker
it
would
displace
people
who
had
been
working
there.
unknown
speaker
their
seniority.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
square
your
statement
just
made
with
footnote
5
in
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
speaks
of
articulation.
i
guess
i
don't
read
it
the
way
you
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
use
of
the
one
phrase
in
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
lends
some
force
to
your
argument.
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
hasn't
been
consistent
either
in
pre-burdine
cases,
and
burdine
came
down
just
a
very
short
time
before
the
fourth
circuit's
case
here.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
wester,
on
this
same
point,
didn't
the
court
in
the
footnote
say
that
ford
neither
articulated
nor
established?
i
mean,
how
can
you
read
it
any
other
way?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wester,
wasn't
that
claim
really
an
afterthought,
and
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
show
that
ford
raised
this
hire
in
order
of
application
defense
in
a
timely
fashion?
unknown
speaker
it
looks
very
much,
frankly,
like
an
afterthought.
unknown
speaker
and
there
apparently
was
no
request
that
the
findings
of
fact
be
amended
to
clarify
it.
nothing.
i
mean,
all
of
a
sudden
it
is
here.
unknown
speaker
was
this
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
it?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
would...
your
submission
was
that
it
was
dispositive.
i
mean,
you
are
suggesting
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
strange,
for
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
address
it
at
all,
if
it
even
recognized
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
suppose
we
can
look
in
your
briefs
to
see
what
you
said
about
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
how
did
this
injure
them,
pending
resolution
finally
of
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
until
there
was
a
layoff,
that
wouldn't
arise.
that
would
be
purely
speculative,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
such
as
here,
can
an
employer
without
the
benefit
of
a
court
order
offer
somebody
retroactive
seniority
to
the
detriment
of
other
employees
there?
is
that
even
possible
to
do?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
isn't
that
very
hazardous
for
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
really
puts
him
on
a
spot.
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
they
haven't
given
it
up
in
an
agreement,
which
might
be
the
typical
case,
but
even
if
they
haven't,
then
what
does
that
do
to
the
innocent
other
employees
who
are
affected
by
inserting
someone
laterally?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
rights
similar
to
that
will
be
affected
in
the
future
if
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
stands,
because
then
the
employers
will
be
given
an
incentive
to
place
someone
in
a
higher
seniority
position
than
opening,
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
will
you
spell
out
for
me
exactly
what
offer
ford
should
have
made
to
these
people,
in
your
estimation?
unknown
speaker
if
that
had
been
what
happened,
what
would
happen
to
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
the
lawsuit
would
have
gone
on.
unknown
speaker
and
then
suppose
the
lawsuit
was
lost.
then
what
happens?
do
these
ladies
stay
in
with
the
seniority
and
all
the
other...
all
the
rest
of
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
not,
they
would
retain
the
seniority
you
say
should
have
been
offered.
unknown
speaker
even
though
ultimately
they
lost
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
effect
prohibited
that,
then
if
the
employer
made
that
kind
of
an
offer,
they
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
open
the
company
up
to
a
strike,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
the
appropriate
remedy,
the
cutoff
of
back
pay
award,
depend
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
nature
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
i
mean,
you
speak
as
if
there
were
only
one
conclusion
that
could
be
drawn
in
this
case
as
to
the
appropriate
type
of
offer
that
would
cut
off
a
back
pay
award,
but
actually
this
is
the
first
time
i
think
the
court
has
considered
it,
and
i
suppose
there
are
two
sides
to
every
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
offer
had
been
to
give
them
provisional
security...
seniority,
dependent
upon
adjustment
after
the
matter
was
litigated?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
exactly
my
hypothesis,
that
they
would
be
put
provisionally
in
that
position
dependent
on
whether
they
could
establish
their
right
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
that
they
could
not
continue
to
litigate
these
issues?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
back
pay
award
unless
they
win
the
lawsuit?
no.
unknown
speaker
you
still
tell
me
that
if
they
lose
the
lawsuit,
they
still
are
slotted
in
with
the
increased
seniority,
and
with
all
the
other
benefits
that
go
with
it,
the
training
that
you
just
now
suggested,
even
though
they
lost
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
you
have
said
that
they
can't...
could
not
have
made
a
proper
offer
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation
without
also
offering
them
the
seniority
that
would
be
theirs
had
they
been
employed
back
in
1971.
would
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
now
they
are
given
that.
you
say
that
is
what
they
must
be
given,
and
they
are
given
that,
the
two
ladies
are.
unknown
speaker
they
go
out
in
the
lawsuit
and
they
lose
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
but
they
still
retain
the
seniority.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
are
qualified,
they
can't
be
fired
just
because
they
lost
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
if
the
employer
did
not
want
them,
he
should
have
taken
his
chances
and
not
offered
them
a
job
at
all.
unknown
speaker
your
position
puts
the...
puts
ford
in
the
same
place
they
would
be
if
they
had
never
made
them
any
offer,
if
ford
had
never
made
any
offer.
unknown
speaker
cutting...
everything.
everything.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
mr.
strauss,
is
there
any
significance
in
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
offer
was
made
they
were
both
employed
at
gm?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
so
if
they
were
unemployed
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
their
taking
of
the
job
at
gm
have
cut
off
the
running
of
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
it
cut
it
off
totally,
as
taking
other
employment?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
it
turned
out
to
be,
what
you
mean
is,
they
left
it
after
a
year
or
so,
don't
you?
or
they
were
laid
off?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
supposing
they
had
stayed
with
gm
for
five
years
and
the
plant
closed.
would
the
employer's
liability
for
back
pay
be
cut
off
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
employer's
plant
closes
after...
gm's
plant
closes
after
five
years,
and
they
are
unemployed
for
three
years,
so
the
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth
year
after
the
offer
was
made,
is
ford
liable
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
comes
a
point
at
which
you
can't
do
it
on
a
house
that
jack
built
basis,
you
know,
where
you
don't
have
reverberations
after
ten
or
fifteen
years.
i
think
the
commission's
approach
here
seems
to
be
quite
different
from
the
common
law
approach
that
people
are
to
be
encouraged
to
settle,
encouraged
to
mitigate
damages,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
pending
the...
encouraged
to
settle,
pending
litigation.
you
seem
to
take
the
position
that
you
want
a
pound
of
flesh.
unknown
speaker
but
this
was
an
effort
to
mitigate
damages
on
the
part
of
ford,
or
to
cause
the
employees
to
mitigate
damages.
unknown
speaker
to
reduce
the
amount
of
liability
on
the
part
of
ford--
unknown
speaker
--and
to
encourage
the
employees
to
mitigate
damages.
unknown
speaker
was
ford
required
to
offer,
in
your
view,
the
seniority
that
these
people
had
at
gm,
which
was
17
months--
unknown
speaker
--or
the
seniority
they
would
have
had
at
ford?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
you.
i
am
not
sure
i
got
your
answer.
the
one
where
he
asked,
what
if
this
offer
had
been
made
provisionally,
seniority
provisionally,
if
they
won
their
lawsuit.
this
is
not
sufficient,
in
your
estimation.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
it
eradicate
the
injury
if
the
seniority
is
offered
provisionally,
that
is,
provisionally
on
their
winning
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
oh,
of
course
it
is
less
secure,
but
maybe
they
didn't
deserve
any
more
security.
unknown
speaker
they
keep
their
job.
they
just
don't
keep
the
seniority.
unknown
speaker
legally,
your
position
can't
depend
on
the
fact
they
were
working
at
general
motors,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
legally,
you
wouldn't
take...
it
seems
to
me
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
they
are
just
unemployed
and
they
said,
well,
we
don't
think
we'd
better
take
this
job
unless
we
get
seniority.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
are
not
arguing
for
mitigation.
they
are
just
arguing
under
the
labor
act
principle
that
the
unconditional
offer
terminated
the
right
to
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
and
would
it
not
have
done
so
had
they
not
been
employed
at
gm?
unknown
speaker
that
just
guarantees
them
the
right
to
partially
win
his
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
the
employee.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
does.
he
does.
he
may
offer
him
a
job,
but
why
does
he
have
to
guarantee
him
the
seniority?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
put
the
risk
of
losing
on
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
risk
of
losing...
if
the
employee
lost
his
lawsuit,
he
wouldn't
get
any
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
or
any
seniority.
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
understand
why
you
think
it
is
some
injury
to
him,
the
employee,
the
woman,
if
they
accepted
provisional
status
of
their
seniority.
that
is,
they
would
get
just
what
they
were
asking
for
subject
to
the
proposition
that
if
they
lost
their
lawsuit
they
would
give
it
up.
they
are
going
to
give
it
up
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
seniority
is
one
of
the
issues
in
the
lawsuit,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
and
if
they
lose
on
that
issue,
are
you
going
to
say
that
they
have
some
kind
of
constitutional
right
to
it?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
repeatedly.
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
were
unemployed
and
he
made
them
this
conditional
offer.
i
offer
you
a
job,
and
i
offer
you
conditionally
on
your
winning
the
lawsuit
seniority
equal
to
what
you
would
have
had,
and
the
employee
takes
the
job,
takes
the
job,
and
continues
to
litigate.
he
wants
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
he
loses
the
lawsuit,
and
so
he
gets
no
back
pay,
and
the
employer
suggests
that
he
should
then
not
have
his
seniority.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
the
employee
says,
no,
sorry,
i
will
not
take
the
job
because
you
didn't
make
me
an
unconditional
offer
of
seniority.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
employee
goes
on
and
loses
the
lawsuit.
what
does
he
get?
unknown
speaker
completely
unemployed.
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect?
just
the
job?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
loses
the
lawsuit,
he
isn't
going
to
get
anything,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
logic
of
your
position
would
require
an
offer
of
back
pay
because
the
employee
could
often
come
in
and
say,
i
have
had
to
borrow
money,
and
so
forth,
to
pay
hospital
bills
and
the
like.
unless
i
get
back
pay,
i
am
not
in
the
position
i
would
have
been
had
there
been
no
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about...
the
statement
of
the
labor
board
principle
as
you
phrase
it,
it
seems
to
me,
would
really
always
justify
the
employee
in
saying,
i
am
not
made
whole
unless
you
give
me
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
seniority
is
not
collateral?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what
is
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
both
correct
then.
seniority
and
back
pay
then
should
be
treated
alike.
is
that
what
that
seems
to
suggest?
unknown
speaker
it
does
if
he
can't
pay
off
the
loan
that
he
had
to...
you
know,
he
can't
make
the
payments
for
the
washing
machine
and
the
car
and--
unknown
speaker
--if
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
date
of
the
application
for
the
job,
which
there
often
is,
say
they
tried
one
or...
i
take
it
the
employer
to
be
safe
would
have
to
give
the
maximum
amount
of
seniority,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
cut
off
the
running
of
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
prevented
ford
from
offering
seniority
rights
retroactively,
what
incentive
would
there
have
been
for
ford
to
make
any
re-employment
offer?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
be?
because
back
pay
would
continue
to
run?
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
for
nine
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
have
to
offer
something
that
you
have
no
contractual
right
to
offer,
you
are
not
in
a
very
strong
position
to
settle,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
like
what?
unknown
speaker
like
more
money.
unknown
speaker
so
the
government
is
really
taking
a
position
that
discourages
settlement,
it
seems
to
me.
is
that
the
position
of
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
offering
re-employment.
if
you
are
advising
the
employer,
the
employer
had
a
contractual
right
that
prohibited
it
offering
retroactive
seniority,
i
would
say,
just
sit
tight
and
litigate.
why
offer,
because
back
pay
continues
to
run,
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
running
in
any
event
under
your
theory.
why
offer
anything?
unknown
speaker
which
is
everything
they
ask
for.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
they
have
got
to
give
everything
that
is
being
demanded
or
else
they
can't
mitigate
the
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
add
up
two,
three,
four,
and
five,
it
adds
up
to
exactly
that.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
this
was
a
complete
futility
to
make
this
offer
of
reinstatement
on
the
job
subject
to
having
the
unresolved
matters
decided
in
a
routine
way.
unknown
speaker
it
has
not
yet
been
decided
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
has
been
suggested
three
or
four
times
in
questions
from
the
bench
that
what
the
position
of
eeoc
is,
or
amounts
to,
is
that
employers
are
wasting
their
time
to
make
offers
of
reinstatement
in
the
position
while
the
other
issues
are
being
resolved.
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
had
been
no
seniority
system.
all
the
facts
are
the
same,
except
no
seniority
system
at
all,
and
he
made
the
offer,
and
then
the
person
was
employed
at
general
motors
at
what
he
thought
was
a
better
job,
so
he
just
stayed
with
general
motors,
and
then
his
job
at
general
motors
ran
out
and
he
sued
for
back
pay
at
ford.
he
wouldn't
get
back
pay
for
any
time
after
the
offer,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
say
it
was
reasonable
to
stay
at
general
motors.
his
back
pay
at
ford
certainly
wouldn't
run
beyond
the
offer.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
no
seniority
system.
they
just
offered
him
a
job.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
allege
discrimination,
don't
you,
because
at
this
time
it
has
not
been
determined
whether
there
was
or
was
not
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
but
before
the
determination
both
parties
are
kind
of
looking
at
their
whole
card,
really.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
the
commission
take
the
position
as
far
as
possible
consistent
with
the
statute,
encourage
mitigation
of
damages,
encourage
employees
to
cut
liability,
and
encourage
settlement?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
final
answer
on
the
chief
justice's
question
about
a
provisional
offer?
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer
is
that
that
kind
of
offer
would
not
suffice.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss...
oh,
excuse
me.
did
you
finish
your
answer?
i
don't
think
you
can
phrase
your
test
in
terms
of
whether
it
is
reasonable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
employee,
because
in
the
example
justice
white
gave
you,
if
there
were
no
seniority
system
at
ford,
and
they
were
employed
at
general
motors,
and
very
reasonably
decided,
well,
i
don't
think
i
will
take
the
ford
offer,
you
agree
that
would
nevertheless
cut
off
their
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
so
it
does
not
turn
just
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
employee's
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
need
to
be
bound
by
the
labor
board
principle,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
and
anyway,
isn't
that
just
some
discrete
application
of
a
mitigation
rule?
unknown
speaker
why
should
the
labor
board
rule
be
important
in
this
context
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
weren't?
then
how
would
we
come
out
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
just
on
a
straight
mitigation.
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
would
come
out
differently
on
your
provisional
offer.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
he
wouldn't
continue
to
suffer
if
he
won
the
lawsuit,
but
if
he
lost
it,
why
should
he
continue
to
have
his
seniority
that
he
didn't
deserve
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that
is
just
the
labor
board
rule.
your
only
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
was
the
labor
board
rule.
unknown
speaker
on
a
mitigation
theory,
i
can't
imagine--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
unknown
speaker
if
you
admit
that,
why,
this
is
a
provisional
offer
case,
isn't
it,
because
in
effect
they
said,
you
get
the
job,
and
provided
you
win,
you
get
everything
else,
too.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
