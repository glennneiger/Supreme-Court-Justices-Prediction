mr.
david
a.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
first
address
the
back
pay
issue.
we
are
willing
to
assume
arguendo
that
the
nlra
principle
governs
this
case,
although
we
don't
think
that
conclusion
is
obvious,
but
there
is
no
support,
either
in
the
law
developed
under
the
labor
act
or
in
the
logic
of
the
labor
act
principle
for
holding
that
the
july,
1973,
offer
to
gaddis
and
starr
cut
off
their
back
pay
awards
at
that
date.
the
best
way
to
understand
what
that
principle
is
and
why
those
offers
did
not
cut
off
the
back
pay
awards
is
to
understand
the
rationale
of
the
labor
act
principle,
and
that
straightforward
rationale
is
that
if
an
employer
can
ensure
that
after
a
certain
date
an
employee
will
suffer
no
further
effects
from
an
alleged
discriminatory
act,
then
the
employer
should
not
continue
to
accrue
liability
after
that
date.
in
other
words,
if
the
july,
1973,
offer
had
placed
gaddis
and
starr
in
such
a
position
that
after
that
date
they
would
not
continue
to
suffer
the
effects
of
the
petitioner's
discriminatory
refusal
to
hire
them,
then
under
the
labor
act
principle
petitioner
would
not
continue
to
accrue
back
pay
liability,
but
the
july,
1973,
offer
to
gaddis
and
starr
was
not
sufficient
to
prevent
further
injury
to
them
because
that
offer
left
them
at
a
continuing
seniority
disadvantage.
they
were
at
a
two-year
seniority
disadvantage
that
was
entirely
the
result
of
petitioner's
refusal
to
hire
them
in
1971.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
would
have
injured
them
in
a
number
of
ways.
it
would
have
reduced
the
health
and
life
insurance
benefits.
it
would
have
exposed
them
to
a
greater
risk
of
layoff,
and
less
job
security.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
they
would
have
been
at
that
disadvantage.
they
would
have
had
that
much
less
security,
as
well
as
a
variety
of
other
disadvantages
in
the
warehouse.
i
don't
know
the
details,
but
customarily
bidding
on
overtime
and
bidding
on
more
attractive
jobs
are
all
functions
of
seniority.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
details
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
just
haven't
been
litigated
on
that
point.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
may
well
be.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
may
well
be
that
the
employer
has
given
up
his
right
to
make
the
sort
of
offer
that
would
be
necessary
to
cut
off
the
back
pay
award
in
the
course
of
collective
bargaining,
but
that
is
no
different
from
many
litigants
who
find
that
their
chances
to
improve
their
litigating
position
by
making
a
settlement
offer
or
in
some
other
way
to
improve
their
position
are
blocked
by
a
contract
they
have
entered
for
mutual
advantage.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
are
really
two
points
to
be
made
about
that.
the
first,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
those
employees
are
only
being
placed
in
the
position
they
would
have
been
in
had
the
employer
never
discriminated,
but
the
second,
and
perhaps
more
fundamental,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
holding
doesn't
do
anything
to
the
rights
of
those
employees.
whatever
rights
they
have
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
whatever
remain
intact,
and
unaffected
by
this
decision.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
their
collective
bargaining
agreement
permits
it,
they
will
presumably
do
that,
but
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
permits
it,
then
there
is
no
sense
in
which
the
incumbent
employees
have
rights,
because
they
have
only
the
rights
given
to
them
by
the
collective
agreement.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
should
have
said,
to
summarize,
that
they
will
be
put
in
the
position
in
1973
they
would
have
been
in
had
they
been
hired
in
1971.
if
those
jobs
were
now...
if
they
would
have
received
a
routine
pay
increase
or
routine
promotion,
they
would
be
hired
at
that
position,
and
since
they
would
have
received
two
years'
seniority,
they
would
be
entitled
to
those
two
years'
seniority
with
the
company,
health
and
life
insurance
benefits,
and
layoff
protection.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
then
there
would
be
no...
the
back
pay
award
would
be
cut
off
at
that
date,
so
that
when
gaddis...
when
the
commission
proved
the
discrimination--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
lawsuit
would
have
gone
on.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
would
be
subject
to
the
same
terms
as
the
other
employees.
if
they
were
incompetent,
they
could
be
fired,
and
so
on.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
don't
know
that
they
would
have
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
they
might
have
violated
the
collective
bargaining.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right,
but
the
issue
is
whether
gaddis
and
starr's
back
pay
award
is
going
to
be
cut
off.
now,
it
would
be
anomalous
to
say
that
the
amount
of
their
back
pay
award
depends
on
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
ford
entered
for
its
advantage
with
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees.
there
may
well
be
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
would
permit
this
sort
of
remedial
slotting
in,
and
if
there
were,
there
could
be
no
claim.
that
argument
that
gaddis
and
starr's
back
pay
award
should
be
cut
off
simply
could
not
be
made.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
i
suppose
there
are
two
sides
also.
it
may
be
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
the
offer
would
not
have
to
include
the
two
years'
seniority.
there
is
just
no
suggestion
that
those
circumstances
existed
here.
for
example,
if...
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
if
in
1973
the
jobs
gaddis
and
starr
were
denied
in
1971
included...
would
have
included
after
two
years
additional
responsibilities
for
which
they
had
not
been
trained,
then
some
arrangement
could
have
been
worked
out
so
they
would
receive
the
training
before
taking
on
those
responsibilities,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that
here.
there
is
no--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
they
have
to
be
given...
they
have
to
be
put
in
the
position
they
would
have
been
had
they
been
hired
in
1971.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
my
understanding
of
the
labor
board
principle
is
that
that
would
be
a
conditional
offer.
if--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--oh,
of
course
they
could
continue--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--they
can
continue...
well,
they
can
continue
to
litigate
the
issues,
no
matter
what.
the
question
is
whether
they
can
cut
off
the
back
pay
award,
and
in
order
to
cut
off
the
back
pay
award,
they
have
to
ensure
that
that
employee
will
not
be
injured
after
the
date
at
which
they
proposed
to
cut
it
off.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
isn't.
that's
right.
there
is
no
back
pay
award,
of
course.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
aren't
required
to
be
slotted
in.
the
employer
chose
to
give
them
that
job
offer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right,
proper
meaning
cutting
off
back
pay.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
um-hm.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
um-hm.
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
are
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
employees.
now,
if
they
lose
the
lawsuit,
for
example,
because
the
court
found
that
they
were
not
qualified
for
those
jobs,
and
they
remain
unqualified
for
the
jobs,
they
can
be
fired,
if--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
not...
if
the...
well.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right.
that's
right.
i
suppose
if
it
is
an
at
will
contract,
they
could
be
fired
at
will,
but
if
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--as
far
as
cutting
off
the
back
pay
award
is
concerned.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right,
because
the
offer
was
neither
sufficient
to
cut
off
the
back
pay
award
nor
did
it
give
them
an
opportunity
to
mitigate
damages
which
they
did
not
take.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
is
significant
to
the
mitigation
of
damages
question.
there
is
an
argument
that
had
they
not
been
employed
at
gm,
and
had
they
refused
to
take
ford's
offer,
that
would
have
been
an
unreasonable
failure
to
mitigation
damages,
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
that's
right.
but
there
is...
petitioner
doesn't
even
seriously
contend
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
them
to
keep
their
gm
jobs
instead
of
coming
with
two
years'
seniority
that
they
had
gone
out
and
earned
at
gm
after
having
been
discriminated
against
by
ford.
it
was
unreasonable
for
them
not
to
give
that
up.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
taking
of
the
job
at
gm
reduced
the
running
of
the
back
pay
award.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
short
answer
is
that
they
would
not
be
made
whole
if
it
cut
them
off
entirely.
the
gm
job,
i
don't
know
if
it
paid
more
or
paid
less,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
less
good
job,
and
they
were
forced
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no,
the
plant
closed.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
wouldn't
be
cut
off,
but
it
would
probably
be
zero,
or
it
would
be
very
low,
because
all
the
wages
they
earned
at
gm
would
be
deducted
from
the
back
pay
award.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
the
matter
hasn't
been
settled
by
then,
hasn't
been
litigated
out
by
then,
yes,
it
would,
because
they
are
in
the
gm
job,
don't
forget,
because
ford
discriminated
against
them.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
i
think
this...
in
the
first
place,
this
case
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
settlements.
there
is
no
settlement
offer
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
tries
to
present
this
as
a
settlement
offer.
it
wasn't.
it
was,
as
he
emphasizes,
an
unconditional
offer.
settlements
remain
where
they
were
before,
and
the
incentives
to
settle
remain
where
they
were
before.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
was
an
effort
to
reduce--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
it
was
an
effort
to
reduce
the
amount
they
would
be
liable
for,
but
it
comes
to
us
in
the
posture
that
ford
has
been
found
to
have
discriminated,
and
the
question
now
is,
is
the
back
pay
award
going
to
be
reduced
below
the
amount
that
would
be
needed
to
make
them
whole.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
seniority
they
would
have
had
at
ford.
that's
the
labor
board
principle.
the
seniority
and
the
wages
and
so
on
that
they
would
have
had
at
ford.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that,
if
it
were
made
in
those
terms,
it
would
not
be
sufficient.
they...
if
they
were
hired,
they
would
be
under
the
same
rules
as
every
other
employee,
and
if
they
were
unqualified
for
the
jobs
and
could
be
fired
for
that
reason,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
ford
from
hiring,
but
ford
does
not
eradicate
their
injury,
does
not
prevent
a
further
accumulation
of
their
injury.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
at
that
point,
they
are
still
placed
in
a
position
that
is
less
secure
than
they
would
have
been
had
they
not
been
discriminated
against.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right,
and
that,
i
think,
is
what
the
mitigation--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
that
is
what
the
mitigation
principle
is
designed
to
deal
with.
i
think
then
the
question
becomes,
was
it
reasonable
for
them
to
keep
the
jobs
they
had
gone
out
and
found
after
they
were
discriminated
against,
as
opposed
to
taking
ford's
job,
and
the
two
courts
below
found
that
it
was
reasonable
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
not
on
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
are
two
different
principles
at
stake.
one
is
the
labor
act
principle,
and
the
other
is
the
mitigation
of
damages
principle.
the
labor
act
principle
does
not
depend
on
their
working
at
gm.
the
mitigation
principle
does.
either
can
justify
reducing
a
back
pay
award.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
to
the
extent--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
that's
right.
that's
right,
and
to
the
extent
their
argument
is
limited
to
the
labor
act
principle,
it
is
irrelevant,
but
in
answer
to
the
suggestions
that
justice
blackmun
was
making
that
it
is
somehow
unfair
to
the
employer
to
say,
you
can't
give
them
a
provisional
offer
of
seniority,
i
think
that
would
not
be
unfair
because
the
employee
remains
under
a
duty
to
act
reasonably,
and
if
that
was
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
mitigate
damages,
then
the
employee
should
have
taken
it,
eyed
though
it
was
provisional
seniority.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
guarantees
whom,
justice
white?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
doesn't...
the
employer
can
stand
pat.
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
give
up
anything.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
employer
doesn't
have
to...
well,
the
risk
of
losing
is
on
the
employer
the
way
the
risk
of
losing
every
lawsuit
is
on
a
party
to
the
lawsuit.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right,
and
if
the
employer
lost
his
lawsuit,
he
would
be
liable
for
everything.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
at
the
time
that
offer
was
made
to
them,
they
had
jobs
that
didn't
have
this
condition
on
it
that
they
had
to
win
their
lawsuit
in
order
to
retain
their
seniority.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right,
but--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--oh,
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
of
course
not.
well,
as
i
said,
the
employer
could
simply
stand
pat
and
offer
them
nothing,
and
take
his
chances
on
the
lawsuit.
he
chose
not
to
do
so.
he
made
them
an
offer.
now,
at
the
time
he
made--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--um-hm.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
would
be
fine.
the
employee
accepted
the
offer
and
could
be
fired.
there
is
certainly...
i
mean,
perhaps
i
misstated
myself.
there
is
certainly
no
suggestion
that
the
employer
is
prohibited
from
making
such
an
offer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
um-hm.
and
the
employee
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--was
the
employee
unemployed
at
the
time
this
offer
was
made?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
then
it
would
quite
possibly
be
a
failure
to
mitigate
damages.
that
would
depend
on--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--according
to
the
common
law
principle
that
if
you
have
an
opportunity
to
mitigate
damages,
you
should
take
it,
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
if
he
loses
the
lawsuit,
he
is
not
going
to
get
anything.
that's
right.
if
he
wins
the
lawsuit,
his
award
might
be
reduced
for
the
failure
to
mitigate
damages
if
he
were
unemployed
at
the
time
he
rejected
the
offer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
that
would
be
the
only
possible
argument
that
could
be
made
for
back
pay.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
require
back
pay.
there
is
a--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
the
reason
it
does
not,
justice
stevens,
is
that
there
has
been
an
historic
difference
recognized
by
this
court
in
a
case
called
gullet
gin,
between
the
collateral
and
the
direct
effects.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
seniority,
i
think,
is
a
direct
effect.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
back
pay
is
awarded
for
the
direct
effects,
and
not
for
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no,
the
back...
the
offer
does
not
have
to
include
back
pay
accrued
up
to
that
point,
because
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
injuries
occurring
after
that
point.
the
question
is,
what
kind
of
offer
cuts
off
the
further
accrual
of
the
back
pay
award.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
those
are
collateral...
those,
i
think,
are
historically
regarded
as
collateral
consequences.
if
the
lawsuit
were
litigated
straight
through
to
completion
without
any
offers
and
the
employee's
back
pay
was
then
being
computed,
it
would
be
computed
on
the
basis
of
lost
wages
and
so
on,
and
there
wouldn't
be
extra
damages
for
his
inability
to
pay
off
his
loan.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
would
be
litigated
out
at
the
end,
to
be
absolutely
certain.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
in
order
to
be
absolutely
safe,
although
he
would
be...
it
could
be
litigated
out
at
the
end
when
the
application
was
made.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
is
always
an
incentive
to
settle.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
they
could
always
settle.
there
is
always
an
incentive
to
settle.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
have
precluded
a
settlement
offer
including
seniority,
they
could...
would
have
had
to
have
offered
the
employee
something
else
to
get
it
settled.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
whatever
the
employees--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--would
take,
like
more
money.
they
could
still
settle.
it's
important
to
see
that
the
employer
can
still
settle
the
case
on
whatever
terms--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--not
at
all,
justice
powell.
i
think
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
settlements.
the
employer
here
claims--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
he
can...
back
pay
would
continue
to
run.
he
may
have
precluded
himself
from
making
an
offer--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
he
can
settle.
he
can
still
settle.
he
can
still
offer
whatever
will
get
the
employees
to
give
up
their
suit,
and
that
is
unaffected
by
this--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--which
is
whatever...
they
will
assess
their
chances
of
winning
the
case.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
absolutely
not.
that
is
absolutely
not--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--if
they
want
to
cut--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
turned
out
not
to
do
the
employer
any
good
because
it
was
not
reasonable
for
the
employees
to
take
it,
and
in
justice
white's
hypothetical,
they
have
been
unemployed,
and
might
have
been--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--both
courts
below
believed
it
was
reasonable
for
them
not
to
give
up
their
gm
jobs
to
take
the
ford
job
back.
had
they
not
reached
that
decision,
it
might
have
been
far
from
complete
futility.
the
question
is
whether
that
offer
cut
off
the
back
pay
award.
that
is,
whether
gaddis
and
starr
are
no
not
to
be
made
whole
by
not
receiving
any
back
pay
after
1973
because
they
turned
down
those
offers.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
not
at
all.
there
are
at
least
two
reasons...
three
reasons
why
they
are
not.
they
can
try
to
settle
the
case,
and
that
is
completely
unaffected
by
the
decision
below.
they
can
make
an
offer
that
will
get
the
employee
assessing
his
chances
of
winning
and
losing
to
give
up,
and
justice
brennan,
that
may
be
something
very
much
less
than
what
the
employee
is
asking
for
if
he
thinks
his
chances
of
winning
are
not
great.
he
may
settle
for
something
very
little.
second,
he
can
put
them
in
the
position
they
would
have
been
in
had
he
not
discriminated,
and
if
he
says
at
this
point,
if
he
says
to
the
employee,
at
this
point
we
are
drawing
the
curtain,
and
we
will
continue
to
litigate
about
any
injuries
you
have
suffered
up
until
now,
but
from
now
on
i
am
putting
you
in
the
position
you
say
you
would
have
been
in
if
i
had
not
discriminated
against
you.
if
the
employer
says
that,
then
he
has
cut
off
the
back
pay
award
under
the
labor
act
principle.
or,
third,
he
can
give
the
employee
an
opportunity
to
mitigate
damages,
and
then
the
question
becomes,
does
the
employee
act
reasonably
in
not
accepting
that
offer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
would
depend
on
whether
his
decision
to
stay
at
gm
was
reasonable.
that
is
the
old
common
law
principle
of
having
a
reasonable--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--oh,
if
the
offer
gave
him...
put
him
in
the
position
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--then
it
would
cut
off
the
offer.
of
course,
the
job
would
have
to
be
at
1973
wages,
not
1971
wages.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
we
are
talking
about
cutting
off
a
back
pay
award,
reducing
back
pay
below
the
amount
that
would
be
needed
to
make
victims
of
employment
discrimination
whole,
and
there
has
to
be
some
reason
for
chopping
off
the
award,
not
just
reducing
it
by
the
amount
of
subsequent
earnings
or
subsequent
amounts
that
could
have
been
earned,
but
chopping
off
the
award
at
the
date
of
the
offer.
now,
there
is
some
logic
to
doing
that.
if
the
offer
takes
the
form
of
saying,
from
now
on,
you
will
suffer
no
further
the
effects
of
the
discrimination,
then
it
makes
sense
to
say,
you
will
not--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right,
but
of
course
the
employer
is
not
liable
at
all
for
any
back
pay
if
he
is
not
found
to
have
discriminated.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right.
that's
right,
but
in
that
they
are
in
the
same
position.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
absolutely
do
all
three
of
those
things,
and
if
this
had
been
an
unreasonable
decision
by
the
employees,
if
they
had
been
unemployed
and
had
turned
down
a
good
job
offer,
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
failure
to
mitigate
damages.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
the
offer
has
to
be
to
place...
and
i
think
this
is
the
board
rule.
the
offer
has
to
be
to
place
them
in
the
same
position
as
other
employees.
they
can't
be
under
a
cloud--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
sort
of
offer
would
not
suffice,
although,
although
they
would
be
in
no
better
position
than
other
employees,
and
if
they
proved
to
be
incompetent
or
unqualified,
and
that
were
a
ground
for
dismissal,
they
could
be
dismissed
subsequently.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
if
ford--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
back
to
the
two
principles.
the
labor
act
principle
is
distinct
from
the
mitigation
principle.
the
labor
act
principle
says,
if
you
are
put
in
a
position
such
that
you
will
not
continue
to
suffer
the
effects
of
the
alleged
discrimination,
that
cuts
it
off
no
matter
how
reasonable
it
was
to
take
that
job.
then
there
is
a
separate
way
the
employer
can
reduce
his
back
pay,
and
that
is
by
showing
that
the
employee
had
a
reasonable
chance
to
take
a
job,
whether
or
not
that
job
was
identical
to
the
one
he
would
have
had
had
he
not
been
discriminated
against
and
he
failed
to
do
that.
either
of
those
avenues
can
be
used
by
the
employer
to
reduce
back
pay.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
that's
right.
in
fact,
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
certainly
serves
the
same
policies
as
the
mitigation
rule,
justice
white.
the
reason
i
am
distinguishing
it
so
sharply
is
that
i
think
analytically
they
rest
on
different
foundations,
and
it
is
important
to
see
the
rationale
of
the
board
rule.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
it
is
not
obvious
that
it
should.
we
are,
as
i
said,
accepting
arguendo
that
it
should
because
the
remedial
provision
of
title
vii--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
certainly
don't
think--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
certainly
don't
think
there
is
any
logical
sense
in
cutting
off
the
back
pay
award
at
a
date
if
the
employee
continues
to
suffer
injury
after
that
date
on
account
of
the
employer's
discrimination.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
he
continues
to
suffer
the
injury
of
being
under
the
provisional
cloud
which
he
would
not
have
been
under.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
are
cutting
off
back
pay,
and
we
are
saying,
no
back
pay--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
agree,
the
provisional--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--a
provisional
offer
would...
may
well
suffice
to
mitigate
damages
in
certain
circumstances.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
do
think
there
is
a
possible
mitigation
argument
in
this
case.
the
problem
is
that
both
lower
courts
found
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
decline
the
ford
offer,
and
it
is
a
reasonableness
test.
