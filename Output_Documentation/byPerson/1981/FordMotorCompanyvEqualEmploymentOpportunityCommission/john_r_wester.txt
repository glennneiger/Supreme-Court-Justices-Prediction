mr.
john
r.
wester
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
presents
two
issues
of
employment
discrimination
law.
the
first
issue
is
whether
an
employer's
potential
back
pay
liability
to
a
discrimination
claimant
continues
to
accrue
after
the
claimant
has
rejected
the
employer's
unconditional
job
offer
of
employment.
the
second
issue
is
whether
ford
was
improperly
required
to
prove
its
explanation
for
its
employment
decisions
in
this
case.
the
resolution
of
the
back
pay
issue
may
well
affect
the
handling
of
almost
any
employment
discrimination
case
in
which
an
employer
finds
itself
able
to
offer
employment
to
a
discrimination
claimant
before
the
determination
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
the
facts
essential
to
the
resolution
of
this
issue
may
be
stated
briefly.
on
july
21,
1971,
judy
judy
gaddis
and
rebecca
starr
applied
to
work
at
the
ford
motor
company's
parts
warehouse
in
charlotte,
north
carolina.
both
had
recently
been
laid
off
from
general
motors
warehouse,
where
each
had
worked
for
some
ten
months.
neither
was
hired.
ms.
gaddis
then
wrote
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
charged
that
ford
had
not
hired
ms.
starr
or
her
because
they
were
women.
neither
ms.
gaddis
nor
ms.
starr
resumed
regular
employment
again
until
january
of
1973,
although
ford
did
employ
both
women
in
its
parts
warehouse
for
some
six
weeks
in
late
1972.
in
july
of
1973,
seven
months
after
the
women
had
returned
to
work
at
general
motors,
ford
had
a
vacancy
for
a
permanent
warehouse
job,
the
same
job
for
which
ms.
gaddis
and
ms.
starr
had
initially
applied.
that
vacancy
was
the
first
ford
had
had
for
a
permanent
position
since
ms.
gaddis
had
charged
ford
with
employment
discrimination.
ford
offered
the
position
first
to
ms.
gaddis,
and
she
declined
it.
ford
then
offered
the
position
to
ms.
starr.
she
declined
it.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no,
sir,
it
occurred
some
two
years
after,
nearly
so,
following
the
filing
of--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--the
offers
to
these
claimants
occurred
some
two
years
following
the
charges
that
were
filed,
nearly
two
years.
neither
of
ford's
offers
included
seniority
or
back
pay,
nor
did
either
offer
require
ms.
gaddis
or
ms.
starr
to
abandon
any
aspect
of
their
discrimination
claims
against
ford.
two
years
later,
in
july
of
1975,
the
commission
brought
this
suit.
the
district
court
concluded
that
ford
had
discriminated
against
gaddis
and
starr
when
it
did
not
hire
them
in
1971,
and
also
concluded
that
ford's
offers
in
1973
had
no
effect
on
the
amount
of
back
pay.
mr.
john
r.
wester
ford's
back
pay.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
am
saying
that
it
was
rejected
in
both
cases.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
wester
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no.
no,
your
honor.
let
me
say
that
there
were
no
conditions
attached
to
the
offer
by
ford.
with
respect
to
the
claimants'
response,
the
evidence
is
that
both
testified
to
ford's
administrative
clerk
who
delivered
the
offers
by
wire
and
by
telephone,
that
neither
wanted
to
be
the
only
woman
in
the
warehouse.
there
was
just
one
position,
and
neither
wanted
to
be
the
only
woman.
that
is
what
she
said.
and
neither
woman
mentioned,
i
might
add,
any
claim
for
retroactive
seniority
or
back
pay
at
the
time
the
offers
were
made.
there
was
no
evidence
that
that
was
mentioned.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no,
sir,
they
did
not.
mr.
john
r.
wester
they
were
offered
1973
jobs,
your
honor,
the
same
jobs
they...
1973
jobs
in
the
warehouse.
there
has
been
no
question
about
that
in
the
evidence.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
am
unaware
of
that.
there
has
been
no
issue
of
that,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
think
not.
the
current
rate
is
what
all
the
evidence
indicates.
they
received
1973
offers
at
the
1973
wage.
they
had
worked
there,
as
you
well
recall
from
the
statement
of
facts,
just
previous
to
that,
and
from
all
the
record
shows,
they
were
offered
1973
rates
when
they
were
offered
these
jobs.
mr.
john
r.
wester
that's
correct.
they
were
not.
neither
was.
and
there
was
no
discussion
of
it
at
the
time.
mr.
john
r.
wester
they
would
have
had
the
wages
determined
by
the
bargaining
agreement
with
the
united
auto
workers.
it
would
not--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--i
am
unaware
of
that,
and
it
would
require
me
to
speculate
outside
the
record
to
answer,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes,
your
honor,
because
both
women
were
offered
jobs.
the
offers
occurred
first
to
ms.
gaddis,
who
declined
it.
then
it
was
offered
to
ms.
starr,
and
she
declined
it.
that
is
our
position.
the
district
court
held
ford's
liability
to
gaddis
and
starr
with
allowances
for
interim
earnings
extended
to
the
end
of
1977,
the
date
the
court
entered
its
findings
in
the
case.
over
a
dissent,
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
its
conclusion
rejecting
ford's
contention
that
its
unconditional
offers
of
employment
cut
off
the
accrual
of
back
pay.
ford
submits
that
the
fourth
circuit's
holding
should
be
reversed,
first
because
it
is
unfair
to
employers,
to
incumbent
employees,
and
to
claimants,
second,
because
it
is
unworkable
for
the
title
vii
process,
and
third,
because
there
is
a
rule
available
that
is
better
in
all
respects,
and
that
is
the
rule
followed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
circuit
courts
reviewing
the
board's
decisions.
the
fourth
circuit's
holding
means
that
an
employer
charged
with
employment
discrimination
can
be
assured
that
a
job
offer
will
stop
the
accrual
of
back
pay
liability
only
by
offering
not
only
the
job
initially
sought,
but
also
retroactive
seniority,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
indicates,
back
pay
as
well.
thus,
to
shut
off
the
back
pay
meter,
the
employer
must
offer
the
claimant
essentially
all
relief
that
the
claimant
could
be
awarded
should
he
or
she
ultimately
prevail
at
a
trial.
the
practical
effect
of
this
holding
is
to
require
that
employers
give
up
any
meaningful
right
to
contest
and
defend
against
the
claimant's
allegations.
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
is
also
unfair
to
incumbent
employees,
because
job
offers
that
comply
with
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
will
undermine
their
seniority
rights,
although
these
employees
are
third
parties
totally
removed
from
the
discrimination
controversy.
mr.
john
r.
wester
well,
yes,
your
honor,
but
when
the
offer
was
made,
there
is
no
finding
of
any
discrimination.
the
offer
is
made--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--the
offer
is
made
following
the
alleged
discriminatory
act.
at
the
moment
the
offer
is
made,
the
matter
of
discrimination
is
a
matter
of
allegation
alone.
mr.
john
r.
wester
to
the
contrary.
it
is
fundamental
to
our
position
that
the
court
understand
the
posture
in
which
these
offers
were
made,
that
is,
before
any
finding
of
discrimination.
there
is
no
question
that
this
court
has
stated
that
both
back
pay
and
retroactive
seniority
would
have
to
be
provided,
if
there
was
to
be
a
valid
offer
or
a
reinstatement
offer
following,
or
instatement
offer
for
this
case,
following
a
finding
of
discrimination.
to
the
contrary,
in
this
case,
this
offer
occurred
before
a
suit
was
even
brought,
and
some
four
years
before
a
finding
of
discrimination.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes,
because
there
still
is
no
adjudication
of
discrimination.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice
stevens.
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
is
unfair
to
incumbent
employees
because
it
requires
an
employer
to
award
seniority
to
a
claimant
who
has
never
worked
for
that
employer,
although
such
an
award
will
necessarily
dislodge
from
their
positions
on
the
seniority
ladder
all
employees
who
have
been
hired
subsequent
to
the
date
the
applicants
applied
for
work...
the
claimants
applied
for
work.
if
the
employer
is
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
award
of
seniority
will
breach
any
standard
seniority
provision
of
that
agreement.
apart
from
the
obligations
under
any
such
agreement,
however,
an
employer
in
ford's
view
should
not
be
encouraged
to
protect
itself
from
continuing
back
pay
liability
by
sacrificing
the
interest
of
present
employees
who
have
earned
and
who
rely
upon
their
seniority
standing.
this
court's
decisions
have
carefully
delineated
the
basis
upon
which
seniority
rights
of
incumbent
employees
may
be
altered.
in
each
such
decision,
this
court...
the
predicate
set
by
this
court
for
permitting
those
seniority
rights
to
be
affected
was
either
a
finding
of
discrimination
or
the
adoption
through
collective
bargaining
of
a
comprehensive,
narrowly
drawn,
and
temporary
affirmative
action
plan
designed
so
as
not
to
affect
unnecessarily
the
seniority
interest
of
employees
in
the
plant.
the
fourth
circuit's
rule,
we
submit,
has
no
such
foundation.
instead,
it
encourages
an
employer
to
make
self-interested
ad
hoc
decisions
whether
in
any
given
case
the
employer
wishes
to
cut
off
its
back
pay
liability
instead
of...
cut
off
its
back
pay
liability
at
the
expense
of
the
seniority
interest
of
incumbent
employees.
mr.
john
r.
wester
to
the
contrary.
what
was
necessary
here
for
ford
to
do,
and
the
rule
that
it
advocates
this
court
should
adopt
in
this
case,
is
precisely
what
it
did,
make
an
offer,
make
an
unconditional
offer
that
there
are
no
strings
attached
to
the
prosecution
of
the
claim,
but
without
any
rights
of
seniority
that
may
be
indeed
the
due
of
the
claimants
once
they
have
established
a
claim.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes.
mr.
john
r.
wester
it
certainly
does
show
such
a
finding,
your
honor,
and
the
key
to
that...
and
the
key
to
that
is
that
it
occurred,
the
finding,
at
a
trial
some
four
years
following
the
date
these
unconditional
offers
were
made,
and
the
key
to
our
position--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--well,
your
honor,
the
second
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
the
finding
was
proper,
whether
the
correct
burden
of
proof
was
applied,
but
putting
that
aside,
we
are
by
no
means
hung
with
the
finding
for
the
purposes
of
analyzing
the
first
issue,
the
back
pay
issue,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
employer
ought
be
entitled
to
a
cutoff
of
further
back
pay
liability.
let
me
emphasize
that
if
ford
is
indeed
and
should
be
held
liable
for
sex
discrimination,
ford
is
liable,
but
through
the
point
of
the
offer
for
back
pay
and
seniority,
and
there
can
be
no
question
of
that.
our
point
is
that
past
that
point,
past
that
point,
there
is
no
subsequently
accruing
back
pay
liability
because
it
is
shut
off
by
the
unconditional
offer
that
ford
makes.
mr.
john
r.
wester
quite
right.
we
did
not,
nor
should
we
have,
for
if
we
had,
it
would
have
required
the
surrender
difficulty
that
i
have
just
described,
and
would
have
also
impacted
certainly
on
the
seniority
interest
of
other
incumbents.
mr.
john
r.
wester
precisely.
they
are
not
made
whole
at
the
time
the
offer
is
made,
but
they
give
up
no
item
whatever,
in
no
respect
whatever,
their
ultimate
right
to
be
made
whole.
mr.
john
r.
wester
absolutely,
and
that
is
the
crux
of
our
position,
and
because
they
can
continue
litigating,
ford's
back
pay
liability
should
have
ended.
mr.
john
r.
wester
that
is
our
entire
argument.
in
fact,
it
would
seem
to
us,
in
light
of
this
court's
holding
in
franks,
that
an
award
of
retroactive
seniority
is
not
always
appropriate
even
after
a
finding
of
liability,
that
it
would
be
anomalous
to
require
an
employer
just
to
cut
off
subsequently
accruing
back
liability
to
throw
in
an
award
of
retroactive
seniority
that
may
turn
out
never
to
have
been
appropriate
at
all.
the
rule
followed
that
we
advocate
and
that
i
have...
the
rule
we
advocate
in
this
case
is
a
rule
that
has
been
developed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
followed
by
all
of
the
circuits
who
have
reviewed
the
board's
findings
on
this
issue.
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
consistently
held
that
an
unconditional
offer
of
reinstatement
or
of
employment
tolls
any
subsequent
accrual
of
back
pay
liability.
the
remedial
provision
of
title
vii,
as
this
court
has
noted
on
several
occasions,
is
derived
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
so
that
the
board's
decisions
provide
again
in
this
case,
as
they
did--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
the
key
is
that
ford
was
obliged
to
make
an
offer
of
the
job
initially
sought,
about
which
there
has
been
no
dispute,
and--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--no,
sir,
that
would
not
be
good,
because
ford
was
obliged--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--that
would
be...
no,
sir,
that
would
not
be
good.
the
key
is--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no,
sir,
half
seniority
would
have
been
bad
just
like
full
seniority
is
bad.
what
we
had
to
offer
was
none.
mr.
john
r.
wester
it
would
have
hurt...
it
would
have
required
ford...
by
no
means
would
it
have
hurt
them,
but
it
would
have
required
ford
to
surrender
its
right
to
defend
against
seniority
benefits
that
the
claimant
would
enjoy.
mr.
john
r.
wester
and
would
also...
absolutely.
and
would
also
require
the
impact
on
the
third
parties
in
the
plant,
the
other
employees.
mr.
john
r.
wester
well,
your
honor,
i
was--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--all
right,
sir.
i--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--no,
sir.
that
is
exactly...
it
is
important
that
i
note
that
is
not
what
ford
offered.
ford
did
not
make
any
such
offer
in
this
case.
to
the
contrary,
its
offer
did
not
require
in
any
respect,
and
the
record
is
undisputed,
the
waiver
of
any
seniority,
the
waiver
of
any
back
pay.
it
required
nothing
of
the
sort.
mr.
john
r.
wester
precisely.
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
the
offer
was
unconditional.
it
has
never
been
challenged
in
either
court
as
other
than
unconditional.
the
district
court's
findings
and
the
fourth
circuit's
findings
do
not
fault
ford's
offer
in
that
respect.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes,
sir,
most
certainly,
because
again
ford's
offer
required--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--well,
sir,
it
depends
on
how
you--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--it
depends
on
how
you
define
a
piece
of
it.
the
piece
of
it
ford
would
give
them
was
the
job
they
initially
sought
and
unconditionally
so,
with
no
strings
whatever
attached
to
their
continuing
right
to
litigate
fully
their
claims
and
to
receive
full
make
whole
relief.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no,
sir.
there
has
been
no
intimation
that
we...
that
we
tried
to
stop
them
from
litigation.
to
the
contrary--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--they
were
already
in
court.
that's
quite
right.
mr.
john
r.
wester
well,
precisely,
nor
should
we
be
required
to.
that
is
our
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wester
nor
did
they
give
up
anything,
and
that
is
the
rest
of
our
point.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no,
sir,
not
in
any
way.
mr.
john
r.
wester
it
was
not
involved
at
that
stage,
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
pending
claim
for
back
pay
by
reason
of
their
charge,
as
well
as
for
seniority
and
all
other
benefits--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--and
all
other
benefits
that
attend--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--sir?
mr.
john
r.
wester
we
offered
not
for
settlement--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--no,
sir,
it
wasn't
a
settlement
offer.
it
was
offer...
you
are
quite
right,
the
bare
bones
job,
but
unconditionally
so,
with
no
attendant
conditions
of
any
sort.
that
is
what
we
offered.
mr.
john
r.
wester
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
wester
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
wester
no,
sir.
no
one
does.
mr.
john
r.
wester
because
it
is
not--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--it
is
not
a
settlement,
your
honor.
it
is
an
unconditional
offer.
mr.
john
r.
wester
and
it
was
not
purported
to
be,
nor
do
we
argue
that
it
is.
mr.
john
r.
wester
it
is
simply
an
unconditional
offer.
mr.
john
r.
wester
none,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wester
none
whatever.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes,
your
honor.
the
seniority
provisions
were
explained
by
ford's
warehouse
manager
at
the
trial,
who
testified
that
seniority
was
earned
by
working
there.
you
earned
it
after
90
days,
and
if
you
did
work
90
days
or
more,
then
your
seniority
started
from
the
first
day
you
started
work.
we
would
contend
that
this
sort
of
offer
would
have,
of
course,
since
these
claimants
had
never
worked
there,
given
them
in
these
circumstances
two-year
seniority,
and
they
would
have
move
down
all
those
on
the
seniority
ladder
hired
subsequent
to
their
applications.
mr.
john
r.
wester
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
wester
without
any
question.
displace
all
of
those
who
were
hired
subsequent
to
these
applications.
we
submit
that
the
decisions
from
the
board
and
the
circuit
courts
reflect
a
striking
of
a
careful
balance
between
the
rights
of
alleged
victims
of
discrimination,
the
interests
of
employers
in
retaining
their
right
to
defend
against
such
charges,
and
the
rights
of
incumbent
employees
to
maintain
their
seniority
standing.
ford
submits
that
that
rule
provides
the
employer
an
incentive
to
offer
the
claimant
the
job,
provides
the
claimant
an
incentive
to
accept
it,
requires
neither
employer
nor
claimant
to
waive
any
defense
or
claims,
and
avoids
any
unnecessary
interference
with
the
rights
of
incumbent
employees.
we
would
command
that
rule
to
this
court.
there
is
another
issue
presented
in
this
case.
this
concerns
the
standard
the
fourth
circuit
applied
in
assessing
ford's
explanation
of
its
failure
to
hire
gaddis,
starr,
judy
gaddis,
rebecca
starr,
the
claimants
whom
i
have
been
discussing,
and
a
third
claimant,
zettie
smith.
ford
contends
that
the
fourth
circuit
imposed
a
burden
of
proof
on
ford
that
this
court
expressly
rejected
in
texas
department
of
community
affairs
versus
burdine.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
square
it,
your
honor,
because
that
footnote,
if
anything,
confirms
what
the
fourth
circuit
said
in
its
introductory
remarks
concerning
the
burden
of
proof
ford
bore.
what
the
district
court...
what
the
court
of
appeals...
i
beg
your
pardon...
stated
in
footnote
5
was
that
ford
had
failed
to
convince
the
fourth
circuit
of
the
truth
of
its
explanation.
the
district
court
found
the
facts
to
be
otherwise,
i
believe
was
the
language
employed.
mr.
john
r.
wester
well,
i
think
it
does
speak
of
articulation
and
establish,
and
speaks
of
some
of
the
words
that
have
been
approved
by
this
court.
my
point
is
the
analysis
employed
makes
it
clear
to
us
when
the
entire
portion
of
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
is
read
in
that
regard
to
indicate
ford
had
to
prove
its
rebuttal
case.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
this
court
in
burdine
actually
just
more
fully
stated,
perhaps,
the
standards
of
proof
and
what
was
required
to
meet
those
standards,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
i
read
footnote
5,
what
actually
it
does
show
is
that
ford
did
not
satisfy
at
the
rebuttal
stage
the
district
court
of
the
truth
of
its
explanation,
and
that
was
a
matter
left
for
the
pretext
stage.
ford
was
therefore
convicted,
so
to
speak,
on
the
force
of
the
prima
facie
case,
and
was
denied
the
effect
of
a
rebuttal
it
should
have
had.
mr.
john
r.
wester
there
is
no
question
the
fourth
circuit
said
that.
because
ford
did
articulate,
your
honor,
through
the
evidence
it
introduced
into
trial,
because
ford
did
articulate,
the
use
of
those
words
confirmed
that
the
burden
imposed
on
ford
was
one
of
proof,
and
no
less
than
that.
to
explain
why
it
did
not
hire
these
claimants,
gaddis
and
starr,
ford
introduced
evidence
that
for
legitimate
and
non-discriminatory
reasons
ford
had
not
actually
reached
their
applications
in
the
course
of
the
review
conducted
by
the
warehouse
manager.
he
did
not
after
he
identified
two
male
applicants
proceed
to
later
filed
applications,
and
thus
had
no
occasion
to
make
any
comparison
of
the
males'
applications
with
these
later
filed
claimants'
applications.
even
assuming
gaddis
and
starr's
applications
had
been
on
file
at
the
time
the
decisions
were
made,
ford's
evidence
that
the
applications
were
not
reached
in
the
ordinary
course
is
an
adequate
articulation,
in
our
view,
of
the
legitimate
reason
for
not
hiring.
mr.
john
r.
wester
it--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
think
it
is
not
all
of
a
sudden
at
all,
your
honor,
and
for
this
reason.
this
evidence
came
out
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
testimony
by
the
warehouse
manager
who
made
the
decision.
it
came
at
the
very
start
of
that.
it
came
as
soon
as
he
explained
that
he
was
the
person
who
made
the
decisions,
and
explained
the
hiring
procedure,
and
explained
the
qualifications
of
the
males
that
were
selected,
and
explained
that
he
never
made
any
comparison.
in
fact,
he
repeated
it
three
times
in
the
course
of,
i
think,
two
pages,
which
are
set
out
in
the
opening
brief.
in
ford's
earliest
brief
on
appeal,
in
ford's
earliest
brief
on
appeal,
we
noted
specifically
that
even
though
there
was
some
ambiguity
about
whether
the
offers
were
actually
communicated
before
these
claimants
were
hired...
before
these
claimants
applied,
there
was
no
question,
the
record
was
unambiguous
that
ford
actually
made
the
decisions
without
the
benefit
of
or
comparison
with
the
females'
applications.
now,
ford
has
raised,
i
submit
to
you,
contrary
to
the
commission's
suggestion
about
that,
this
issue
in
a
timely
manner,
that
it
certainly
did
clearly
articulate
its
reason.
it
came
from
exactly
whom
the
court,
the
district
court
would
expect
it
to
come,
the
person
who
made
the
decisions,
and
it
did
it
in
a
direct
manner.
mr.
john
r.
wester
it
was,
your
honor,
in
the
passage
that
i
just
referred
to--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
that
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wester
it
is...
it
certainly
would
be.
mr.
john
r.
wester
well,
i
can't
explain
that,
and
wouldn't
know
how
to
characterize
it.
i
should--
mr.
john
r.
wester
--you
can.
we
have
set
that
out
at
page
16
of
the
opening
brief
and
reproduced
it
at
page
18
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
r.
wester
i
would
suggest
that
the
reasonableness
analysis
employed
in
the
mitigation
cases
to
which
mr.
strauss
has
referred
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
and
the
reason
it
does
not
apply
is
because
the
reasonableness
analysis
in
those
cases
has
always
come
from
the
context
where
the
courts
or
the
board
were
evaluating
whether
a
job
other
than
the
one
that
was
the
subject
of
the
claim
was
being
offered,
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
it
was
the
job
that
was
the
subject
of
the
claim
that
was
being
offered.
all
of
the
mitigation
damages
concerned
interim
or
alternative
employment
other
than,
distinct
from
the
job
initially
sought.
except
for
that
clarification,
i
shall
be
pleased
to
address
any
questions
anyone
might
have
of
me.
otherwise,
i
shall
waive
the
remainder
of
our
allotted
time.
