unknown
speaker
mr.
coven,
you
have
used
the
word
"impasse".
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
word
of
art?
what
is
an
impasse?
unknown
speaker
where
there
is
a
real
breakdown
in
negotiations,
not
just
a
failure
to
come
to
terms
on
one
particular
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
in
this
very
case
negotiations
did
resume.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
as
soon
as
this
company,
the
employer
withdrew,
they
made
an
example
out
of
him
by
striking
him,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
they
closed
all
that
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
coven,
at
the
time
of
the
withdrawal,
had
all
the
strikers
been
replaced?
unknown
speaker
but
not
until
the
time
of
the
withdrawal?
unknown
speaker
had
been
replaced.
well,
would
you
have
had...
why
do
you
say
that
your
duty
to
bargain
hadn't
ended?
if
you
had
replaced
them
all...
you
had
replaced
them
all
permanently?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
that
all
of
your
employees,
your
new
employees
were
union
members,
or
might
have
been.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
coven,
you
say
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
an
impasse
has
been
reached,
and
yet
you
say
there
is
no
generally
accepted
meaning
of
the
term
"impasse".
unknown
speaker
well,
what
kind
of
a
stipulation
is
that?
unknown
speaker
did
the
board
explain
its
change
from
its
1958
ruling
to
its
1950
ruling?
unknown
speaker
mr.
coven?
unknown
speaker
mr.
coven?
unknown
speaker
has
the
board,
either
in
this
case
or
in
other
cases,
determined
basically
whether
employers
do
in
fact
withdraw
from
bargaining
units
because
other
members
have
reached
interim
agreements,
and
to
what
extent
unions
in
fact
use
the
whipsaw
tactics?
now,
i
know
that
is
the
theory
on
which
this
decision
rests.
now,
either
in
this
case
or
in
other
cases,
has
the
board
made
determinations
about
those
matters?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
factual
finding
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
it
was
the
negotiations
by
the
other
two
employers
with
the
union
that
triggered
the
petitioner's
withdrawal?
unknown
speaker
were
these
independent
negotiations
of
the
two
employers,
did
they
take
place
before
or
after
the
petitioner's
withdrawal
from
the
group?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
a
finding
that
at
those
meetings
interim
agreements
had
been
arrived
at?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
that
any
action--
unknown
speaker
--all
that
happened
is
that
there
had
been
these...
you
labeled
them
secret
meetings.
unknown
speaker
but
no
agreements
reached.
unknown
speaker
he
also
added,
did
he
not,
that
they
didn't
even
reach
the
level
of
negotiations?
unknown
speaker
mr.
coven,
suppose
when
the
union
struck
your
client,
your
client
had
said,
well,
let's
negotiate
an
agreement,
and
the
union
said,
all
right,
that's
exactly
what
we
wanted.
this
is
a
selective
strike.
so
you
negotiated
an
agreement.
would
that
agreement,
would
you
think
that
you
would
have
had
the
right
to
say
to
the
union,
well,
i
will...
we
will
negotiate
an
agreement,
but
i
am
withdrawing
from
the
unit,
and
this
agreement
that
i
am
negotiating
with
you
will
not
be
subject
to
revision
if
you
then
negotiate
with
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
and
arrive
at
a
different...
at
a
different
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
union
says,
well,
we
don't
agree
with
you
at
all,
we
will
negotiate
an
agreement
with
you
but
if
we
then
negotiate
an
agreement
with
the
unit,
this
contract
that
we
are
going
to
sign
with
you
will
be
subject
to...
we
will
throw
it
out
the
window.
you
would
say
that
you
would
have
the
right
to
hold
them
to
the
interim
agreement?
unknown
speaker
the
union
says,
sure,
we'll
reach
an
agreement
with
you,
but
it
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the...
to
revision,
and
you
say,
well,
we
will
sign
the
agreement,
but
it
won't
be
subject
to
revision.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
interim
agreements
signed
with
individual
employers--
unknown
speaker
--when
there
is
a
selective
strike.
unknown
speaker
is
it
always
understood
then
that
they
will
be
subject
to
revision?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
board's
position,
mr.
coven,
that
those
interim
agreements
are
subject
to
displacement
by
the
agreement
finally
arrived
at
by
the
unit?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
thought
the
board's
position
was
that
as
a
matter
of
law--
unknown
speaker
--those
interim
agreements
fall
as
soon
as
the
unit
has
negotiated
an
agreement
for
the
industry.
unknown
speaker
it
is
all
right,
but
it
is
subject
to
displacement
by
the
final
agreement
reached.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
find
out
from
mr.
come.
i
thought
the
board's
position
was
as
i
have
stated
it.
unknown
speaker
if
the
nlrb
were
subsequently,
for
example,
to
determine
that
it
wouldn't
permit
interim
agreements
to
be
reached
by
individual
employers
within
the
bargaining
unit,
or
if
at
some
point
this
court
were
to
make
that
determination
so
that
interim
agreements
were
not
possible
to
be
reached,
would
you
then
find
that
the
nlrb's
unusual
circumstance
test
would
be
satisfactory
on
withdrawal?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
then
at
some
point
of
impasse,
for
instance,
after
it
has
lasted
a
long
time,
as
was
the
case
here,
that
that
in
and
of
itself
should
be
an
unusual
circumstance,
and
that
you
can
disregard
the
interim
agreement
problem
altogether?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
can
a
single
employer
be
forced
to
join
a
multi-employer
agreement?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
employers
themselves
could
agree,
could
they
not,
that
they
won't
permit
any
of
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit,
the
employers
in
the
unit
negotiate
a
separate
interim
agreement.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
that
be
a
provision
of
the
employer
bargaining
unit
agreement?
unknown
speaker
there
wasn't
such
an
agreement
here.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
nature
of
the
agreement
that
caused
them
to
negotiate
as
a
group?
the
letter
of
withdrawal
in
november
of
'75
refers
to
an
earlier
letter
of
february
19,
1975,
authorizing
group
negotiation.
unknown
speaker
does
the
february
19
letter
appear
in
the
record?
i
couldn't
find
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
if--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
agree
that
under
that
letter,
if
there
had
been
no
impasse,
but
one
of
the...
say
your
client
just
didn't
like
the
final
agreement
that
was
negotiated,
would
it
have
nevertheless
been
obligated
to
sign
that
agreement
if
everybody
else
was
willing
to
sign
it?
unknown
speaker
you
do.
unknown
speaker
that
point
is
covered
in
your
brief,
counsel.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position,
mr.
come,
that
an
unwilling
employer
can
be
forced
by
the
board
into
a
multi-employer--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
board's
definition
of
"impasse"?
unknown
speaker
in
its
brief
or
in
its
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
the
board's
view
is
that
an
impasse
is
something
that
occurs
fairly
regularly.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
petitioners
here,
uncertain
of
the
board's
reasoning,
and
not
familiar
with
the
interpretation
which
you
have
just
given
to
the
word
"impasse",
felt
that
there
had
been
a
total
breakdown
in
the
bargaining
framework,
and
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
accomplished
by
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come?
unknown
speaker
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
say
whether
or
not
the
board
has
ever
considered
that
the
mere
passage
of
time
has
brought
an
impasse
as
defined
to
an
end
so
that
the
employers
were
free
to
bargain.
suppose
it
happened
for
a
year
and
a
half
instead
of
for
half
a
year.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
there
were
unusual
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
this
impasse
had
lasted,
say,
for
two
years,
the
board's
position
would
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
longest
time
for
a
so-called
impasse?
this
six
months,
is
this--
unknown
speaker
--is
this
in
itself
very
long?
unknown
speaker
has
the
board
in
this
situation
ever
dealt
with
one
that
lasted
as
long
as
a
year?
unknown
speaker
anything
longer
than
a
year?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
each
instance
where
it
has
lasted
a
year
or
longer,
your
answer
still
to
my
brother
powell
is
that
the
board
has
said
that
that
impasse
is
not
an
unusual
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
but
the
board
might
reach
a
conclusion
that
a
two-year
impasse
did
present
an
unusual
circumstance,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
factors
such
as
what
kind
of
an
industry,
what
impact
on
the
public,
a
whole
range
of
factors,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
an
impasse
by
itself,
no
matter
how
long
it
lasts,
never
is
considered
an
unusual
circumstance
which
would
permit
withdrawal
by
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
board's
position
also
that
it
is
a
policy
of
the
board
to
ensure
equality
of
withdrawal
rights
from
these
units,
both
from
the
standpoint
of
employers
and
unions?
unknown
speaker
then
how
do
you
really
distinguish
between
the
ability
of
an
employer
to
withdraw
in
the
event
of
an
impasse
versus
permitting
interim
agreements
to
be
signed?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
for
example,
if
the
union
happens
to
strike
one
of
the
employers?
unknown
speaker
well,
buffalo
linen
didn't
say...
it
said
the
union
can
do
that,
but
it
didn't
say
what
the
consequence
on
the
employer
is
with
respect
to
the
multi-employer
unit.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
board
says
that
follows,
it
is
superseded,
i
gather,
whether
or
not
the
parties
agree
that
it
shall
be
superseded.
unknown
speaker
i
am
speaking
now
of
one
of
the
interim
agreements,
as
you
have
defined
them.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
of
a
separate--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
the
interim
agreement
must
say
in
terms
that
this
shall
be
superseded
by
the
agreement
reached
with
the
multi-employer
unit.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
situation
if
the
parties
agree?
then
i
gather
it
is
not
an
interim
agreement.
unknown
speaker
they
make
the
agreement,
and
they
say,
and
this
shall
not
be
superseded
by
any
final
agreement
reached
by
the
unit.
then
what
is
the
position
of
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
employer.
may
the
employer
now
pull
out?
is
he
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
that
says
to
me
the
board
would
not
find
him
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
for
making
that
kind
of
agreement
and
withdrawing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
could
we
decide
this
case
without
discussing
interim
agreements?
and
if
so,
should
we?
unknown
speaker
but
we
do
have
to...
we
will
certainly
have
to
consider
what
the
impact
of
a
selective
strike
is.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
said
the
impact,
though,
what
the
consequence
is
on
the
employer
with
respect
to
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit.
unknown
speaker
you
thought
you
were
home
free.
unknown
speaker
justice
o'connor?
thank
you.
mr.
come,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
something
about
the
hi-way
billboards
case,
which
indicated
that
when
an
impasse
is
reached,
that
the
parties
under
those
circumstances
can
take
certain
action.
the
union
can
call
for
a
strike,
the
employers
can
engage
in
a
lockout,
the
employer
could
hire
replacements,
the
employer
could
make
unilateral
changes
in
working
conditions
rejected
by
the
union.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
all
those
things
except
maybe
the
working
conditions,
which
didn't
appear
to
be
an
issue,
had
been
done,
and
yet
the
impasse
continued.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
that
it
was
an
unusual
circumstance,
after
all
those
other
things
have
been
tried,
because
that
is
the
purpose
of
letting
them
be
tried?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
withdrawal
from
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
an
economic
weapon
which
a
party
may
use
without
the
board's
supervision?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
is
it
clear
that,
bearing
in
mind
the
consensual
nature
of
the
formation
of
the
multi-employer
unit,
if
at
the
time
the
employers
agreed
to
bargain
as
a
group,
each
of
them
put
in
his
agreement
with
the
others
that
should
there
be
a
period
of
three
months
where
no
progress
is
made
in
negotiations,
then
each
of
us
shall
have
the
right
to
withdraw
and
bargain
separately,
and
that
was
made
known
to
the
union,
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
aren't
multi-employer
bargaining
units
certified?
are
they
ever?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
event,
you
wouldn't
think
that
the
agreements
would
hold,
would
they,
upon
withdrawal?
unknown
speaker
with
the
board's
rule
about
units.
unknown
speaker
yes.
was
the
unit
in
this
case
certified?
unknown
speaker
but
the
board
sort
of
treats
it
like
a
certified
unit,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they
were
free
to
do
just
what
he
did,
though,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
having
locked
out,
what
was
to
prevent
them
from
hiring
on
the
open
market?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
my
first
question.
unknown
speaker
precisely
what...
will
you
pinpoint
precisely
what
is
the
reason
why
that
is
an
impermissible
economic
weapon
on
the
part
of
an
employer
who
withdraws?
i
am
speaking
now
of
this
petitioner.
unknown
speaker
then
my
next
question
would
be,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
come's
response
to,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
employers
going
into
a
multi
unit
could
condition
it
that
90
days
after
the
negotiations
had
been
going,
if
no
result
was
achieved,
they
would
be
able
to
withdraw?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
they
must
get
an
agreement,
and
they
couldn't
get
such
an
agreement
from
a
union.
unknown
speaker
your
response
suggests
that
there
may
be
some
right
on
the
part
of
the
union
to
multi-party
bargaining
units.
unknown
speaker
you
say
those
are
the
rules,
but
if
i
understand
mr.
come's
explanation
of
the
law,
the
law
is
that
the
parties
can
make
any
rules
they
want
to,
if
everybody
agrees.
unknown
speaker
or
because
of
a
strike.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
the
very
first
formal
negotiations
session,
don't
you
have
what
is
in
effect
an
impasse?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
what
point
do
you
know
you
have
an
impasse?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
union
from
singling
out
one
employer
and
negotiating
with
him
privately?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean,
and
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
an
interim
agreement.
they
arrive
at
a
separate
one
which
they
regard
as
final.
what
is
the
consequence
for
the
employer
in
terms
of
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
then
he
is
home
free,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
you
mean
that
automatically
breaks
up
the
multi
unit?
unknown
speaker
but
under
that
view,
then
the
union
is
free
any
time
it
wants
to
to
make
a
separate
agreement
with
an
individual
employer.
unknown
speaker
well,
forget
the
antitrust,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
your
view
of
the
labor
act,
a
union
is
free
to
make
a
binding,
long-term
agreement
with
one
member
of
the
multi-employer
unit
any
time
it
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
putting
interim
agreements
to
one
side.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
view
of
the
law,
it
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
union
to
enter
into
a
binding,
long-term
agreement
with
one
member
of
the
bargaining
unit.
unknown
