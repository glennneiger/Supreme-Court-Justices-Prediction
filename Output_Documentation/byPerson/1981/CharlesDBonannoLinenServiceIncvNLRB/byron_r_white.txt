the
first
of
these
cases,
no.
80-931,
the
bonanno
linen
service,
inc.
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
here,
there
was
a
prolonged
impasse
in
bargaining
between
a
labor
union
and
a
multiemployer
bargaining
agent
representing
petitioner
and
other
employers.
the
union
called
a
selective
strike
against
petitioner,
the
other
employer
has
responded
with
a
lockout
and
the
impasse
continued.ultimately,
petitioner
announced
that
it
was
withdrawing
from
the
unit.
the
lockout
was
then
ended
and
negotiations
were
reopened
and
a
contract
was
signed.
petitioner,
however,
refused
to
sign
the
agreement
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
that
an
impasse
such
has
occurred
in
this
case
did
not
warrant
the
withdrawal
from
the
unit
and
accordingly
found
the
petitioner
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
court
of
appeals
enforced
that
order
and
we
granted
certiorari
because
the
judgment
below
was
in
conflict
with
the
judgments
of
other
courts
of
appeals
on
similar
or
identical
questions.
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
agreeing
with
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
our
reasons
were
stated
at
length
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
rehnquist.
justice
o'connor
also
dissents
in
an
opinion
in
which
justice
powell
has
joined.
