mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
buffalo
linen,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
24
years
ago,
the
court
indicated
that
in
1947,
at
the
time
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
proposals
were
made
to
limit
or
outlaw
multi-employer
bargaining,
but
these
proposals
failed
of
enactment
because
there
was
cogent
evidence
that
in
many
industries
the
multi-employer
bargaining
basis
was
a
vital
factor
in
the
effectuation
of
national
labor
policy
by
promoting
labor
peace
through
collective
bargaining.
the
court
concluded
that
congress
thereby
intended
to...
that
the
board
should
continue
its
established
practice
of
certifying
multi-employer
bargaining
units,
and
intended
to
leave
to
the
board...
the
board's
specialized
judgment
the
inevitable
questions
concerning
such
a
relationship
that
may
arise
in
the
future.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
enacted
section
8(p)(1)(b)
of
the
act
in
'47
which
would
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
strike
an
employer
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
him
into
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit.
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
is
a
consensual
arrangement,
but
once
you
have
that
consent,
then
the
board
in...
pursuant
to
its
function
of
establishing
appropriate
bargaining
units,
has
devised
certain
rules
for
governing
that
relationship
so
as
not
to
unstabilize
the
relationship
that
has
been
established,
and
one
year
after
buffalo
linen,
the
retail
associates'
rules
were
formulated.
under
those
rules,
either
party
is
free
to
get
out
of
a
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
which,
as
i
indicated,
was
voluntary
to
begin
with,
at
the
outset
of
negotiations,
but
once
negotiations
have
started,
neither
party...
and
these
rules
apply
to
the
union
as
well
as
to
the
employers...
can
get
out
absent
mutual
consent
or
unusual
circumstances.
now,
for
the
23
years
that
these
rules
have
been
in
effect,
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
had
occasion
to
pass
on
them
as
a
general
proposition
have
accepted
them.
the
controversy
has
been
over
whether
an
impasse
in
bargaining
is
an
unusual
circumstance
that
would
warrant
an
untimely
unilateral
withdrawal
from
a
bargaining
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board,
and
i
think
it
has
stated
it
as
well
as
anywhere
on
page
41
of
its
opinion
in
this
case--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--it
is
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
that
is
the
board
decision.
and
they
are
quoting
from
their
opinion
in
hi-way
billboards,
which
was
the
first
case
in
which
they
attempted
to
really
spell
out
why
an
impasse
was
not
an
unusual
circumstance,
and
they
point
out
that
an
impasse
is
only
a
temporary
deadlock
or
hiatus
in
negotiations,
which
in
almost
all
cases
is
eventually
broken
either
through
a
change
of
mind
or
the
application
of
economic
force.
skipping
down
a
bit,
suspension
of
the
process
as
a
result
of
an
impasse
may
provide
for
reflection
and
the
cooling
of
tempers.
it
may
be
used
to
demonstrate
the
depth
of
a
party's
commitment
to
a
position
taken
in
the
bargaining,
or
it
may
increase
economic
pressure
on
one
or
both
sides,
and
thus
increase
the
desire
for
agreement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
board
concluded
that
an
impasse
should
not
be
regarded
as
an
unusual
circumstance.
it
is
something
that
is
quite
normal
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
that
would
not
have
availed
them
under
the
board's
view,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
board
has
concluded
that
an
impasse
should
not
be
a
basis
for
getting
out.
an
impasse
may
be
difficult
to
determine
in
a
particular
set
of
negotiations.
sometimes
it
occurs
fast,
sometimes
it
occurs
after
more
prolonged
negotiations,
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
in
the
board's
view,
as
the
authorities
in
our
brief
show,
in
the
view
of
experienced
negotiators
and
mediators
in
the
field,
the
impasse,
experience
shows,
is
ultimately
broken.
it
does
not
signal
a
complete
and
final
breakdown
in
the
negotiations.
it
is
the
time
when
the
mediators
step
in,
if
there
is
one.
it
is
the
time
when
the
parties
may
resort
to
economic
pressure,
as
they
did
in
this
case,
because
you
had
a
strike
against
bonanno
which
is
privileged
under
buffalo
linen,
followed
by
a
lock-out
on
the
part
of
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
factor
to
be
considered,
but
it
is
not
the...
it
is
not--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
the
board
in
determining
what
is
unusual
circumstances
has
confined
that
term
basically
to
two
types
of
situations,
one
where
severe
economic
hardship,
such
as
bankruptcy
or
its
equivalent,
would
result
to
the
employer
who
feels
that
he
has
to
withdraw,
or
a
situation
where,
as
a
result
of
the
union
permitting
or
consenting
to
withdrawals
on
the
part
of
a
substantial
number
of
employers
has
so
fragmentized
the
multi-employer
unit
that
you
have
only
a
shell
of
that
relationship
that
remains.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
have
no
case
that
would--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--this
is
not--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
it
is
not.
i
think
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes,
it
has.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
there
have
been
some
that
have
lasted
longer
than
a
year.
there
have
been
others
that
have
lasted
shorter.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
board
is...
within
these
rules
does
try
to
look
at
these
things
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
think
that
it
could.
we
certainly
don't
have
anything
atypical
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is...
that
is
the
board's
position.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
it
is.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
first
thing
that
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
there
were
no
interim
agreements
here,
but
in
all
candor,
that
has
been
the
problem
with
the
courts
that
have
had
trouble
with
not
regarding
an
impasse
as
an
unusual
circumstance,
so
the
board
in
this
case
and
in
subsequent
cases
has
attempted
to
clarify
its
position
with
respect
to
interim
agreements,
as
distinguished
from
what
may
be
called
final,
separate
agreements.
the
interim
agreement
that
the
board
says
does
not
privilege
an
employer
from
withdrawing
from
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
is
an
agreement
similar
to
the
one
that
i
believe
justice
white
was
discussing,
where
the
union
either
as
a
result
of
its
volition
or
the
employer
who
is
hurting--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
right,
and
buffalo
linen
says
that
they
can
do
that.
the
other
members
are
free
to
lock
out.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
economic
weapons
that
parties
are
free
to
use
in
collective
bargaining,
and
what
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is.
the
point
that
i
am
getting
to
is,
though,
that
the
interim
agreement
that
the
board
would
say
is
in
the
economic
weaponry
area
rather
than
destructive
of
the
unit
is
an
interim
agreement
that
enables
the
struck
employer
to
operate
either
under
the
prior
contract
or
on
the
basis
of
the
terms
that
the
union
has
thus
far
offered
to
the
association,
but
it
is
contingent
upon
being
superseded
by
the
ultimate
agreement,
whether
it
is
better
or
worse
than
the...
than
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is...
well--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
the
parties
would
have
to
so
provide
for
the
board
to
regard
it
as
an
interim
agreement.
if
they
didn't
so
provide--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--then
it
would
be
in
the
category
of
a--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--of
a
separate
agreement,
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
and
in
the
board's
view,
that
is
no
more
destructive
of
the
multi-employer
unit
than
a
situation
where
you
have
a
selective
strike
and
the
employers
lock
out,
but
then
after
a
while
one
of
them
feels
that
he
can
no
longer
take
the
heat,
and
he
resumes
operations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
would
be
the
position
of
the
board
then?
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
would
find
that
such
separate
agreements
do
provide
an
unusual
circumstance,
at
least
where
they
would
be
substantial
enough
to--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--if
he
withdrew--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes.
more
than
that.
the
board
in
a
case
called
olympia
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
here
has
found
that
in
that
situation,
the
association
can
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
against
the
union
and
the
offending
employer
for
refusing
to
bargain,
so
that
i
think
in
terms
of
these
separate
agreements,
they
are
not
going
to
be
a
very
frequent
occurrence,
if
at
all,
in
view
of
the
board's
present
clarification
of
the
total
area,
and
the
only
thing
that
we
are
left
with
are
the
interim
agreements
which
are
contingent
upon
the
ultimate
association-wide
agreement,
and
we
don't
even
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
you
can
decide
it
without
reaching
interim
agreements.
judge
campbell,
who
concurred
in
the
court
below,
thought
that
you
could
do
so.
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
reach
the
question
because
the
third
circuit
in
the
beck
case
had
held
that
even
though
there
wasn't
any
interim
agreements
in
that
case,
the
mere
possibility
of
interim
agreements
required
that
the
court
had
to
address
the
interim
agreement
question.
from
the
board's
standpoint,
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the...
of
the
parties
engaged
in
multi-employer
bargaining,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
get
the
entire
area
clarified.
however,
it
is
not
essential
for
the
court
to
decide
that
question
in
order
to
sustain
the
board
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
but
i
think
that
buffalo
linen
answered
that
question.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
with
buffalo
linen,
the
argument
that
the
second
circuit
made
in
buffalo
linen,
and
it
was
rejected
by
this
court,
was
that
the
mere
fact
that
in
a
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
the
union
selected
one
employer
as
a
strike
was
tantamount
to
withdrawing
from
that
unit
or
destroying
the
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
those
are
merely
examples
of
some
of
the
things
that
could
be
done.
they
don't
exhaust
the...
either
the
arsenal
of
the
economic
weapons
that
are
available
to
the
parties
or
what
could
be
done
to
break
the
impasse.
a
mediator,
for
example,
was
not
brought
in,
which
is
often
the
case,
and
does
result
in
breaking
the
impasse,
and
the
fact
is
that
an
agreement
was
ultimately
reached
here
in
the...
in
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit.
i
know
my
brother
would
suggest
that
that
was
due
to
the
withdrawal
of
bonanno,
but
i
submit
that
it
is
equally
possible
that
that
is
not
so,
because
the
parties
did
not
prior
to
bonanno's
leaving
the
unit,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
those
within
the
unit
that
thought
that
the
way
to
break
the
impasse
was
to
increase
the
wage
offer
that
was
being
given
to
the
union,
and
that
was
what
was
ultimately
one
of
the
ways
in
which
the
log
jam
was
broken.
at
that
point
the
union
withdrew
its
demand
for
compensation.
so,
it
is
equally
as
fair
an
inference.
i
submit
that
bonanno's
departure
retarded
the
forces
that
were
building
up,
because
it
wasn't
until
several
more
months
after
he
left
that
they
finally
got
back
on
the
track
and
worked
out
a
solution
to
the
problem.
the
point
of
it
is
that
the
board
leaves
insofar
as
possible
to
the
parties
the
bargaining
process,
and
doesn't
sit
in
judgment
in
the
economic
weapons
that
they
can
use.
as
this
court
has
indicated
many
times,
the
use
of
economic
weapons
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
system
of
collective
bargaining,
and
the
board's
rule
with
respect...
not
regarding
impasse
as
an
unusual
circumstance,
i
submit,
is
consistent
with
that
general
philosophy,
and
also
with
the
practice
of
collective
bargaining
as
it
works
in
the...
in
the
real
world.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
you
start
with
the
premise
which
we
submit
congress
declared,
that
there
is
a
positive
value
in
multi-employer
bargaining,
insofar
as
its
making
for
efficient
collective
bargaining
and
industrial
peace.
it
follows
that
you
need
some
rules
to
govern
the
conduct
of
that
relationship,
because
if
you
can
withdraw
at
will
after
negotiations
have
started,
the
unit
becomes
a
bargaining
lever
in
the
negotiations,
and
experience
has
shown
that
that
is
not
conducive
to
effective
and
efficient
collective
bargaining,
because
the
parties
have
to
know
what
the
dimensions
of
the
unit
are
before
they
can
determine
what
offers
they
have
to
make,
how
much
strength
they
have
in
the
unit,
and
so
on.
it
is
for
that
or
those
policy
reasons
that
the
board
has
formulated
the
retail
associates
rules
and
why
it
has
concluded
that
impasse
alone
is
not
an
unusual
enough
circumstance
to--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
it.
i
don't
know
that
i
have
seen
such
a
case.
there
may
be
one
after
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
can
be,
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
that
case,
such
a
limited
agreement
might
run
into
conflict
with--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
with
the
principle
of
ray
brooks
that
says
that
for
a
certification
year--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
it
was
not
certified.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
true
when
you
have
a
contract
that
is
negotiated,
but--
