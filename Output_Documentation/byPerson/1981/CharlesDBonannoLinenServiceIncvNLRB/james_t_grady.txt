mr.
james
t.
grady
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
just
trace
these
facts,
because
they
seem
to
be
running
together.
when
the
union
struck
bonanno
on
june
23rd,
1975,
the...
immediately
the
remaining
employers
locked
out
in
support
of
bonanno,
locked
out
their
employees,
so
that
what
started
for
one
day
as
bonanno
only
strike,
the
second
day
of
the
strike
became
all
nine
employers,
including...
in
addition
to
bonanno,
there
was
a
strike,
so
the
multi-employer
strike
was
taking
place.
it
wasn't
bonanno.
it
was
in
support
of
bonanno
that
these
other
employers
locked
out
their
employees.
they...
the
parties
continued
to
meet
during
the
summer
of
1975,
and
the
strike
went
on.
some
of
the
employers
were
able
to
hire
replacements,
some
were
not.
some's
business,
i
am
sure,
was
adversely
impacted
as
a
result
of
the
strike.
the
only
thing
that
happened
on...
between
june
23rd,
when
the
strike
started,
and
november
21st,
when
bonanno
seat
his
letter
to
the
association
effectively
withdrawing,
the
only
thing
that
happened
that
is
in
the
record
is
that
he
successfully
had
replaced
all
his
struck
employees
with
non-union
or
at
least
non-teamster
employees,
so
he
was
effectively
running
a
non-union
shop,
and
had
effectively
beaten
the
strike.
that
is,
he
had
beaten
the
teamster's
union
and
was
now
non-union.
at
this
juncture,
at
this
point
it
was
no
longer
to
his
interest,
economic
interest
to
continue
in
this
multi-employer
situation,
so
he
just
withdrew,
leaving
those
employers
who
had
come,
in
effect,
to
his
rescue,
out
on...
with
their
employees
out
on
the
street.
what
did
they
do?
they
immediately
ended
the
strike.
mr.
james
t.
grady
no,
your
honor.
the
multi-employer
negotiations
were
continued,
continuing,
so
they
could...
they
could
lift
their
lockout
at
any
time
they
saw
fit.
so
they
did.
negotiations
continued
from
november
until
april--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--they
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
grady
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
james
t.
grady
well,
precisely,
your
honor,
it
just
weakens
the
whole
fabric
of
multi-employer
bargaining.
the
glue
that
keeps
multi-employer
bargaining
together
from
the
union
point
of
view
is
the
realization
that
down
the
end
of
the
road
when
we
finally
reach
an
agreement
all
the
employers
in
this
association
are
going
to
be
bound
by
the
terms
and
conditions
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
james
t.
grady
i
believe
he
also...
justice
stevens
indicated
that
there
would
be
notice
to
the
union
of
this
condition.
in
my
opinion,
the
union
would
not
participate
in
such
negotiations,
because
it
would
be
counterproductive.
what
happens
in
this...
in
the
situation
of
an
impasse
alone--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--we
would
say
that
conditioning
the
bargaining
with
such
a
condition
precedent
as
a
term
to
commence
negotiations,
we
would
say
would
be
improper
and
unrealistic,
because
what
happens,
if
i
may
further
answer
your
question,
when
these...
when
we
find
that
the
negotiations,
if
an
employer
can
withdraw,
as
the
petitioner
would
have
it,
we
would
then
have
to
follow
that
employer
and
have
individual
negotiations
with
that
employer,
and
then
the
next
one
goes,
individual
negotiations.
our
resources
are
limited.
we
have
only
so
many
business
agents.
instead
of
having
one
set
of
negotiations
for
nine
employers,
we
would
have
nine
separate
sets
of
negotiations
being
carried
on
simultaneously,
with
the
possible
result
of
uneven
terms
and
conditions
being
negotiated.
as
this
court
well
knows,
we
have
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
so
if
employer
a
has
different
terms
than
employer
b,
and
the
employees
are
doing
the
exact
same
work,
we
will
get...
organizationally
it
would
be
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
us.
mr.
james
t.
grady
it
is
a
consensual
matter,
your
honor.
we
don't
have
to
accept
it.
if
the
employers
wish
it
and
we
agree
with
it,
then...
and
everyone
is
voluntarily
getting
into
it,
just
as
bonanno
did
in
this
case,
right
at
the
outset...
he
volunteered
in
february...
but
we
say,
once
you
are
in,
and
the
board
says,
you've
got
to
conform
to
the
rules,
and
the
rules
are,
you
don't
quit
in
the
middle
of
negotiations.
call
it
impasse
if
you
will,
but
impasse
is
a
common
factor.
in
fact,
the
statute
contemplates
30
days
before
the
end
of
the
agreement
you
must
notify
federal
mediation
conciliation.
well,
in
practice,
before
the
mediator
comes
in,
you
are
already
at
odds.
you
have
said,
well,
i
guess
we
are
not
going
anywhere,
let's
get
the
mediator
in
here
and
see
if
he
can.
now,
technically,
that
is
an
impasse.
mr.
james
t.
grady
it
is
consensual
right.
and
we
would
say
in
the
bonanno
situation,
the
rules
are
what
the
board
law
was
in
effect
at
the
time
bonanno
started,
and
the
rules
at
that
time,
as
they
are
now,
were,
and
are,
that
you
can't
draw
solely
because
of
impasse,
and
i
think
justice...
judge
campbell
in
his
concurring
opinion
was
quite
accurate
in
this--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--right,
strikes
are,
unfortunately,
also
part
of
negotiations,
just
like
impasses.
it
is
the
use
of
economic
strength
by
the
lockout
and
the
strike.
they
are
to
he
expected
in
negotiations
in
the
private
sector.
judge
campbell
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
address
this
whole
question
of
interim
agreements.
he
says,
this
interesting
but
nonessential
matter.
there
was
no
interim
agreements
in
this
case.
an
attempt
to
raise
meetings
to
negotiations
and
to
an
interim
agreement,
it
is
just
not
there.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
there
were
no
interim
agreements.
this
is
strictly
an
employer,
when
he
saw
the
appropriate
opportunity
for
him
withdrawing
from
the
association,
abandoning
his
fellow
employers,
as
it
were,
and
the
important
thing
is,
we
did
reach
a
contract
with
the
remaining
employers
in
april,
and
the
reason
we
reached
it,
in
almost
a
year
of
negotiations,
and
what
some
would
describe
during
an
impasse
period,
is,
the
union
gave
up
its
demand
for
commissions.
mr.
james
t.
grady
no,
because
the
parties...
usually
at
the
first
session
the
ground
rules
are
developed,
and
the
first
proposals
are
exchanged.
then
the
issues
are
narrowed,
and
typically
the
parties
will
say,
all
right,
we
can
agree
on
this
clause,
we
can
agree
on
that,
what
is
left?
and
then
you
go
over...
and
then
you
make
moves.
you
may
increase...
or
the
union
side
would
reduce
its
wage
proposal,
the
employer
may
increase
its
wage
offer,
so
you
may
be--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--i
would
say
a
genuine
impasse
is
when
there
are
no
meetings
scheduled
and
no
plans
to
discuss
anything
any
further,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
james
t.
grady
well,
if
we
did
that,
we
would
again
get
back
to
the
question
whether
it
would
be
an
interim
agreement
or
not.
the
board
says,
if
it
is
an
interim
agreement
and
subject
to
being
modified
and
solely
dependent
on
what
the
ultimate
association
agreement
is,
that
is
permissible.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
an
absolute
agreement,
regardless
of
what
ultimate
contract
is
reached
with
the
association,
then
the
board
seems
to
be
saying
that
that
is
improper,
and
if
you
have
enough
of
them,
particularly
if
you
have...
then
it
is
disruptive
of
the
entire
association,
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
having
an
association--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--i
wouldn't
characterize
it--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--i
don't
see
any.
mr.
james
t.
grady
it
is
just
broken
up.
the
parties
are
back
to
square
one
again,
individual
negotiations
will
take
over
from
there.
mr.
james
t.
grady
i
don't
think
the
law
is
that
clear,
your
honor.
i
think
one
agreement
wouldn't
do
it,
but
if
you
had...
half
your
employers
had
signed
solid
agreements
that
are
not
subject
to
change,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
have
an
association
any
more.
it
is
gone.
mr.
james
t.
grady
i
think
they
do
so.
there
is
another
issue
that
has
not
been
raised
that
i
am
cognizant
of,
and
that
is
some
possible
restraint
of
trade
considerations
with
an
interim
agreement.
mr.
james
t.
grady
it
wouldn't
be
long-term,
your
honor.
it
would
say
by
its
terms,
the
preamble
would
say,
this
agreement
is
an
interim
agreement,
subject--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--oh,
okay.
mr.
james
t.
grady
i
would
prefer
to
have
the
consent
of
the
remaining
employers.
mr.
james
t.
grady
i
would...
if
we
did
that,
it
would
not
violate
the
law,
but
i
would
anticipate
that
it
is
the
end
of
multi-employer
bargaining.
mr.
james
t.
grady
the
board
has
yet
to
define
how
many
of
those
let's
call
them
solid
agreements
add
up
to
breakup--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--the
case
that
they
cite,
i
believe,
was
consensual
in
terms
of
the
remaining
employers.
they
didn't--
mr.
james
t.
grady
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
grady
i
don't
see
that
at
all,
your
honor.
it
is
all
consensual
to
start
off
with,
so
that
if
the
parties
want
to
have
multi-employer
bargaining,
they
can
have
it.
if
they
want
to
end
it,
they
may
do
it.
the
interim
is
not
ending
it.
clearly,
just
walking
out
on
impasse
is
improper,
and
that
is
what
we
are
here
for,
and
that
is
the
only
issue
before
this
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
