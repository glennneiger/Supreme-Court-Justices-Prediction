mr.
sidney
a.
coven
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
please,
the
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
and
in
what
circumstances
an
employer
may
withdraw
from
multi-employer
collective
bargaining
after
negotiations
have
commenced.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
contends
that
the
occurrence
of
an
impasse
during
such
bargaining,
in
this
case
one
which
had
existed
for
more
than
six
months
at
the
time
of
the
withdrawal,
and
which
had
been
followed
by
a
selective
strike
against
petitioner
alone,
not
all
the
members
of
the
group,
justifies
its
withdrawal
from
the
multi-employer
group.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
well,
the
labor
board
has
never
made
an
exact
definition
of
an
impasse.
they
have
found
in
many
cases
that
an
impasse
has
existed,
and
many
cases
have
turned
on
the
question
as
to
whether
there
is
an
impasse,
but
neither
the
board
nor
the
courts
have
ever
precisely
defined
an
impasse.
my
definition
of
an
impasse
is
a
situation
where
the
parties
have
reached
the
point
where
there
is
no
longer
any
progress.
they
have
reached
a
deadlock
or
a
stalemate,
and
neither
party
has
indicated
any
possibility
of
any
movement
whatsoever.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
that's
correct,
your
honor,
in
my...
in
my
opinion.
the
courts...
neither
the
board
nor
the
courts
have
ever
said
precisely
that,
but
that
would
be
the
way
i
would
define
an
impasse.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
yes,
your
honor.
negotiations
did
resume,
and
eventually
there
was
an
agreement,
but
of
course
we
can't
tell
at
this
point,
looking
at
it
from
hindsight,
whether
such...
whether
the
impasse
would
ever
have
been
broken
if
the
petitioner
had
not...
had
not
withdrawn
from
the
bargaining
unit.
if
the
parties
had
remained
locked
in
that
ice
jam,
possibly
this
might
have
gone
on
for
years
and
years.
it
might
have
gone
on
forever
without
any
movement.
it
was
only
when
the
petitioner
did
withdraw
that
we
had
what
might
be
called
the
first
beginning
of
a
thaw
in
the
ice
jam,
and
there
were
certain
actions
triggered
which
i
will
refer
to
later,
which
in
our
opinion,
at
least,
did
provide
the
circumstances
under
which
the
impasse
or
the
log
jam
or
the
ice
jam
was
finally
broken.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
no,
your
honor.
the
strike
took
place
five
months
before
the
impasse.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
the
employer
was
not
closed.
he
hired
replacements,
and
he
continued
to
operate
under
the...
under
the
handicaps
of
a
strike,
and
i
might
add
that
there
were
certain
factors
in
the
strike
which
were
the
subject
of
litigation
in
another
matter,
but
are
not
before
the
court
here
today.
may
i
make
it
clear
at
this
point
that
the
employer,
in
withdrawing
from
the
multi-employer
group,
had
no
intent
to
extinguish
its
bargaining
obligation
to
the
union.
it
offered
to
continue
bargaining
with
the
union
on
a
single
employer
basis.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
well,
the
record
is
not
clear
how
long
before
the
withdrawal
this
happened.
the
record
only
shows
that
at
the
time
of
the
withdrawal,
all
of
the
strikers
had
been
replaced.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
there
are
certain
circumstances
under
which
the
board
presumes
there
is
a
continuing
majority.
we
never
approached
the
point
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
such
a
continuing
majority.
the
employer--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--it
may
be.
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
the
labor
board
in
this
case,
contrary
to
the
petition
then
held
by
five
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
held
that
the
withdrawal
constituted
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
the
circuit
court
for
the
first
circuit
has
affirmed
this
position.
i
make
note,
your
honors,
that
since
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
two
of
the
five
circuit
courts
which
had
formerly
refused
to
follow
the
board
position,
have
adopted
the
board's
position,
and
would
go
along
with
the
board
position.
the
other
three
courts
are
still
standing
by
their
positions.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
were
essentially
stipulated.
the
company
is
in
the
business
of
laundering,
rental,
and
distribution
of
linens
and
work
uniforms.
over
a
period
of
many
years,
or
quite
a
number
of
years,
the
company,
the
petitioner
here,
had
engaged
in
multi-employer
bargaining
with
a
group
of
employers
who
dealt
with
the
teamsters
union
for
the
driver
employees
of
each
of
those
companies.
each
company
had
a
relatively
small
number
of
employees,
and
they
all
joined
together
in
collective
bargaining.
in
1975,
just
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
then
current
contract,
the
parties,
the
employers
again
joined
together
in
this
group,
the
petitioner
and
nine
other
employers,
and
commenced
bargaining
with
the
union.
the
president
of
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
group's
bargaining
committee.
after
a
number
of
meetings,
a
proposed
contract
was
submitted
to
the
employees
for
ratification.
the
contract
or
the
proposed
contract
provided
for
an
increase
in
wages,
and
was
based,
as
the
previous
contracts
had
been,
on
an
hourly
rate
of
pay.
the
employees
rejected
that
proposed
contract,
and
the
union
came
back
at
the
next
meeting
and
proposed
that
instead
of
the
hourly
rate
of
pay
the
employees
be
paid
on
a
commission
basis.
this
was
rejected
by
the
employer's
group.
now,
thereafter,
and
the
parties
have
stipulated
that,
and
the
board
has
found
an
impasse
in
bargaining
was
reached
on
may
15th,
1975,
and
the
main
issue
in
the
impasse
was
whether
or
not
the
employees
should
be
paid
on
a
commission
basis
or
the
hourly
basis.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
well,
i
believe
that
the
parties
stipulated
that
whatever
the
board
defines
as
an
impasse
had
been
reached.
in
my
view,
as
i
said
before,
an
impasse
means
that
the
parties
have
reached
the
point
where
they
were
just
at
loggerheads,
and
nobody
was
showing
any
signs
of
movement,
and
that
is,
i
believe,
what
the
parties
stipulated
to,
and
that
is
what
the
board
found.
on
june
23rd,
1975,
approximately
five
weeks
or
six
weeks
after
the
impasse
had
been
reached,
the
union
called
a
selective
strike
against
only
petitioner,
not
all
the
rest
of
the
employers,
but
only
against
petitioner,
one
of
the
ten,
and
all
of
petitioner's
drivers
joined
the
strike.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
the
union
chose
the
petitioner
only,
why
they
didn't
strike
anybody
else,
but
it
stands
to
reason
that
we
must
assume
that
the
union
had
some
purpose
in
singling
out
the
petitioner,
but
as
i
say,
the
record
doesn't
show
what
that
purpose
was.
at
that
point,
substantially
all
the
other
employers
in
the
bargaining
group
locked
out
their
employees.
thereafter,
the
parties
all
hired
replacements,
and
continued
to
operate
with
the
limitations
of
the
strike.
subsequently,
there
were
a
number
of
additional
meetings
between
the
union,
the
union
and
the
negotiating
committee
of
the
employers.
this
went
on
for
several
months.
there
were
no
results.
the
parties
were
simply
locked.
neither
party
would
move.
the
union
maintained
that
it
wanted
commissions,
to
be
paid
on
a
commission
basis.
the
employers
refused
to
do
so.
and
despite
the
efforts
of
a
federal
mediator,
there
was
no
movement
by
either
party.
this
went
on,
as
i
say,
for
approximately
six
months.
during
this
period
the
petitioner
received
information
that
two
members
of
the
group
had
been
meeting
secretly
with
the
union,
and
although
no
separate
agreements
were
reached,
the
adminstrative
law
judge
of
the
board
who
heard
this
case
specifically
found
"that
before
petitioner
withdrew,
two
other
employees
in
the
group
secretly
had
been
in
direct
touch
with
the
union,
presumably
in
an
effort
to
make
a
separate
settlement.
"
after
the
petitioner
learned
of
the
secret
meetings,
it,
by
letter
dated
november
21st
of
1975,
and
as
i
say,
this
was
more
than
six
months
after
the
impasse,
and
almost
five
months
after
the
strike
against
the
petitioner
had
started,
the
petitioner
notified
the
union
and
the
employers'
group
that
it
was
withdrawing
from
the
group,
and
that
it
would
thereafter
bargain
directly
with
the
union.
now,
on
receipt
of
this
notice
by
the
group,
the
remaining
members
of
the
group
terminated
the
lock-out
and
rehired
all
of
the
persons,
the
employees
who
had
been
previously
locked
out,
and
they
all
returned
to
work.
thereafter,
the
group
and
the
union
continued
to
meet.
at
the
first
meeting
held
after
the
withdrawal,
the
union
representative
merely
noted,
without
saying
anything
more,
that
the
petitioner
had
withdrawn,
and
the
employers'
group
indicated
or
stated
that
another
employer
had
been
designated
as
a
member
of
the
group's
negotiating
committee
to
replace
the
petitioner's
president.
the
parties
had
a
number
of
meetings.
there
was
no
change
in
positions
by
either
party
until
april
the
13th
of
1976,
approximately
four
and
a
half
months
later,
when
the
union
finally
receded
from
its
insistence
on
payment
on
a
commission
basis,
and
agreement
was
reached
on
a
new
contract.
thereupon,
the
union,
which
had
never
communicated
with
the
petitioner
after
receiving
notice
of
withdrawal,
advised
the
petitioner
that
it
considered
it,
the
petitioner,
to
be
bound
by
the
contract
reached
by
the
group,
and
at
that
point
the
petitioner
refused
to
sign
the
contract,
stating
that
it
was
not
bound
since
it
had
withdrawn
from
the
group
a
long
time
ago.
the
union
then
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
labor
board.
the
board,
after
a
hearing,
found
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
had
indeed
occurred,
although,
as
i
stated
before,
five
courts
which
had
considered
that
question
prior
to
that
point
had
held
to
the
contrary.
now,
with
respect
to
the
legal
principles
involved,
may
i
go
back
to
1950,
when
the
board
in
its
morand
brothers
decision
held
that
employers
have
"unlimited
freedom
unilaterally
to
fashion
the
scope
of
or
to
completely
destroy
multi-employer
bargaining
at
their
will
or
fancy.
"
and
squarely
ruled
that
the
parties
were
free
to
bargain
individually
after
an
impasse
had
been
reached
in
association-wide
bargaining.
that
was
the
state
of
the
law
until
1958,
when
the
board
in
its
retail
associates
decision
set
forth
a
new
policy.
the
board
said
that
any
employer
who
is
a
member
of
a
group
can
withdraw
from
that
group
at
an
appropriate
time
before
the
date
fixed
for
commencement
of
bargaining,
has
full
latitude,
is
absolutely
free
to
leave
the
group
at
that
point
without
any
inhibitions
whatsoever,
but
that
once
the
bargaining
is
commenced,
the
employer,
an
employer
may
not
withdraw
from
the
group
absent
mutual
consent
or
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
no.
no,
they
never
referred
to
the
morand
decision
at
all.
they
just
ignored
it.
and
it
did
not
address
the
question
of
whether
an
impasse
was
within
the
category
of
what
the
board
called
unusual
circumstances.
i
may
state
that
in
a
number
of
cases
since
then
the
board
has
subsequently
limited
the
"unusual
circumstances"
to
cases
where
an
employer
can
demonstrate
that
it
is
faced
with
dire
economic
consequences,
such
as
bankruptcy,
or
impending
bankruptcy,
or
to
cases
where
the
multi-employer
group
has
been
significantly
fragmented
as
a
result
of
consensual
withdrawal.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
in
1964--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
well,
this
question
as
to
whether...
as
to
the
effect
of
so-called
interim
agreements
has
been
only
a
fairly
recent
matter
that
has
been
considered
by
the
board.
the
board
has
said
that
where
there
has
been
a
significant
fragmentation
of
the
unit,
the
employer
is
free
to
withdraw,
but
it
is
not...
they
have
never
made
it
clear
whether
there
would
be
significant
fragmentation
by
interim
agreements.
the
board
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
discussed
the
difference
between
what
they
call
separate
agreements
and
interim
agreements.
they
had
never
discussed
that
before.
now,
it
is
still
not
clear
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
consider
the
execution
of
a
number
of
interim
agreements
or
how
many
interim
agreements
as
fragmentation
of
the
group.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
finding
at
all
on
that
question
as
to
what
triggered
it.
the
only
question
was
whether
or
not
the
employer
was
free
to
withdraw
at
that
point
because
of
the
impasse
situation.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
they
took
place
before
the
withdrawal.
the
evidence...
the
evidence
shows
and
the
board
found,
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
the...
these
separate
meetings,
these
separate
secret
meetings
had
been
held
before
the
withdrawal
took
place,
and
it
was
after
the
employer
learned
about
this,
and
there
is
no
finding
as
to
whether
that
triggered
it
or
what
triggered
the
withdrawal.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
there
was
a
finding
that
there
were
no...
no
separate
agreements
found,
but--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--yes.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
no
agreements
were
reached,
but
as
i
say,
the...
as
i
said
before,
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
there
had
been
these
meetings,
secret
meetings
"presumably
in
an
effort
to
make
a
separate
settlement.
"
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
that
might
have
been
possible,
and
if
the
union
had
agreed,
and
if
the
members
of
the
association--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--well,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
matter
for
negotiations,
and
if
there
were
no
agreement
reached
there--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--then
we
have
no
agreement,
your
honor.
now,
to
go
back--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--yes.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
interim
agreements--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--that
depends
on
whatever
the
parties
agree
to
in
their
interim
agreements.
now,
there
have
been...
there
are
a
variety
of
interim
agreements
which
i
think
have
been
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
there
are...
the
briefs
filed
by
the
graphic
arts
employers
group
indicates
that
there
are
several
varieties
of
interim
agreements
which
are...
have
been
entered
into
in
that
particular
type
of
industry.
the...
most
of
the
interim
agreements
that
i
have
been
familiar
with
have
provided
that
if
and
when
there
is
an
agreement
with
the
multi-employer
group,
that
those
terms
will
become
effective.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
well,
i
think
the
board...
the
board
says
that
most
interim
agreements...
i
don't--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
they
say
if
such
a
type
of
agreement,
what
they
call
an
interim
agreement,
has
been
reached,
that
is
all
right,
but
if
those--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--not
unless
the
parties
have
agreed
to
it,
because
otherwise
you
have
what
the
board
now
calls
separate
agreements.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
well,
i
am
sorry.
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
the
board's
position.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
facts...
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
here,
i...
my
own
feeling
is
that
it
isn't
necessary
really
to
go
into
the
question
of
interim
agreements.
i
think
the
interim
agreement
argument
that
the
courts
have
examined
buttresses
our
argument,
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
parties
had
been
locked
in
deadlock,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
movement
for
six
months.
there
is
no
prospect
that
there
is
ever
going
to
be
any
movement.
nobody...
if
things
had
continued
that
way,
this
might
have
gone...
might
still
be
going
on.
we
say
at
this
point,
bargaining
has...
or
collective
bargaining
on
the
multi-employer
basis
has
failed.
it
has
broken
down
completely,
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
is
irretrievable.
we
say
there
is
no
point,
there
is
no
reason,
there
is
no
logic
for
the
board
to
insist
that
an
employer...
that
all
the
employers
stay
locked
in
that
frozen
position.
the
board
allows
people
to
withdraw
at
will
before
bargaining
starts.
why
is
the
multi-employer
unit
so
sacred
that
at
this
point,
after
bargaining
has
broken
down,
they
don't
permit
them
to
withdraw?
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
that
is
our
main
point
here.
that
is
our
main
argument,
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
encourage
collective
bargaining
and
to
avoid
industrial
strife
by
means
of
collective
bargaining.
now,
this
matter
of
this
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
is
something
that
is
not
set
forth
in
the
act
itself.
the
board
under
the
act
must
make
a
determination
as
to
what
unit
is
appropriate.
there
may
be
many
appropriate
units.
at
certain
points,
a
multi-employer
unit
may
be
appropriate,
may
be
the
best
under
the
circumstances,
but
there
reaches
a
point
where
if
the
multi-employer
unit
has
become
completely
ineffectual
and
goes
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
statute,
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
the
board
should
insist
that
that
continue.
in
this--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
no...
it
is
strictly
consensual.
the
multi-employer
unit
is
created
by
the
consent
of
the
parties.
of
course,
there
may
be
situations
where
we'll
say
that
the
teamsters
union
has
a
nationwide
or...
a
nationwide
freight
agreement,
and
there
is
an
independent
employer
who
is
organized
by
the
teamsters,
and
they
say,
well,
in
order
to
have
an
agreement,
you
must
adhere
to
the
terms
of
this
multi-employer
group.
in
that
way,
he
is
forced
to,
but
still
it
is
a
matter
of
consent.
if
he
doesn't
consent,
there
is
no
agreement,
and
then
he
gets
struck.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
they
could.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
it
could
be,
your
honor.
in
this
case--
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
--there
wasn't...
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
such...
such
an
agreement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
employer...
the
petitioner
here
withdrew
from
the
unit,
the
employer's
group
apparently
were
happy
to
see
it
happen
because
they
could
then
terminate
the
lockout
and
get
their
people
back
to
work,
and
then
they
started
negotiations
again.
they
weren't
unhappy
about
it.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
yes.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
what
it...
before
negotiations
started,
each
of
the
members
of
the
group
wrote
a
letter
to
the
union
saying,
we
are
authorizing
the
group
to
bargain
for
us.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
now,
if
i
may,
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
one
matter
that
the
board
has
raised,
and
where
the
circuit
court
talks
about
the
deference
due
the
board
decision.
in
our
opinion,
your
honor,
the...
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
sidney
a.
coven
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
