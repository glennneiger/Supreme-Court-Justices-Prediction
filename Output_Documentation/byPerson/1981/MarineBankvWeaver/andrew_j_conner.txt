mr.
andrew
j.
conner
good
morning.
to
understand
this
case,
the
posture
of
this
case,
is
to
understand
some
of
the
factual
background.
i
think
simply
stated,
sam
and
alice
weaver
go
to
the
bank
at
the
bank's
request
in
early
march
of
1978.
they
have
acquired
a
$50,000
certificate
of
deposit
a
couple
weeks
ago
prior
to
them
going
into
the
bank.
they've
already
been
solicited
to
make
an
investment
in
the
columbus
business
by
the
bank,
and
in
early
march
of
1978
they
in
effect
traded
the
certificate
of
deposit,
the
$50,000
certificate
of
deposit
they
had,
which
was
of
a
maturity
of
six
years,
which
you
undoubtedly
understand
is
critical
because
it
gets
it
outside
the
exception
within
the
'34
or
the
'33
act
that
has
the
nine
month
exclusion,
and
they
traded
that
for
this
particular
agreement,
that
is,
an
investment
position
in
the
columbus
business.
all
of
these
events
occurred
within
a
couple
days
of
each
other
or
a
couple
weeks
of
each
other,
and
one
was
the
consideration
for
the
other;
in
other
words,
they
trade
their
certificate
of
deposit
for
the
right
to
obtain
the
profits
from
columbus.
a
critical
thing
here
in
the
bank's
involvement
is
that
the
bank
induced
this
transaction
for
their
own
benefit,
and
the
reason
why
it
was
to
their
own
benefit
is
that
they
in
effect
were
a
risk
lender
to
columbus
and
unprotected
at
the
time.
and
the
reason
why
they
were
unprotected
is
they
forgot
to
file
their
equipment
liens
properly
in
the
right
county;
so
in
effect
they
had
a
$30,000
or
$40,000
loan
outstanding
that
they
couldn't
collect.
columbus
is
insolvent
at
the
time.
columbus
is
overdrawn
at
this
bank
in
the
checking
account;
in
other
words,
there
is
a
checking
account
and
they're
overdrawn.
i
think
the
record
indicates
way
back
in
'77
that
they
had
been
overdrawn;
they
had
been
overdrawn
continuously.
the
bank
kept
on
honoring
their
checks
to
keep
them
afloat,
if
you
will,
to
keep
columbus
afloat
so
that
they
could
stay
in
business,
so
that
they
could
figure
out
a
remedy
to
this
problem,
because
the
bank
couldn't
collect
on
their
loans
because
they
hadn't
perfected
their
equipment.
so
as
a
consequence
of
that,
they
had
told
columbus,
mr.
piccirillo,
to
go
get
an
investor,
and
they
introduced...
that
is,
mr.
piccirillo
introduced
mr.
weaver
to
the
bank
because
the
bank
in
effect
was
approving
whoever
was
going
to
get
in
business
with
mr.
piccirillo,
and
mr.
weaver
in
february
of
1978
refused
to
get
involved
in
the
business.
he
refused.
he
said
it
was
too
risky;
he
didn't
know
columbus
financial
status.
so
what
happened
was
then
the
bank,
realizing
that
mr.
weaver
was
going
to
be
the
way
that
they
could
enhance
their
position,
that
is,
that
they
could
get
their
overdrawn
checking
account
solved
and
get
the
loans
taken
care
of,
went
out
and
actively
went
after
mr.
weaver
to
get
involved
in
columbus.
and
they
solicited
him
out
at
his
farm,
and
they
finally
persuaded
him
to
come
in
with
his
certificate
of
deposit
and
pledge
it;
and
they
told
his
that
if
he
pledged
the
certificate
of
deposit,
they
would
loan
columbus
$65,000,
and
all
or
substantially
all
the
$65,000
would
go
for
working
capital.
this
was
perceived
by
mr.
weaver
to
be
a
safe
investment.
it
was
perceived
by
mr.
weaver
to
be
safe
for
many
reasons,
one
of
which
was
the
fact
that
the
bank
told
mr.
weaver
that
in
fact
the
bank
had
filed
proper
liens
against
columbus'
equipment,
and
they
were
protected,
and
they
had
sufficient
collateral
to
protect
mr.
weaver.
those
three
statements,
affirmative
statements
by
the
bank
were
false.
they
weren't
going
to
lend
columbus
$65,000.
they
were
going
to
take
the
$65,000,
just
as
they
did
in
this
case,
and
pay
themselves
off,
leaving
little
or
no
money
for
columbus.
and
the
second
and
third
statements
were
false,
that
is,
that
they
had
perfected
liens,
because
they
filed
them
in
the
wrong
county.
it's
a
quirk
here.
columbus
is
right
on
the
county
line
between
erie
county
and
warren
county,
and
the
bank's
main
office
is
in
erie
county;
and
in
any
case
they
filed
the
equipment
liens
in
the
wrong
county
so
they
were
unprotected.
that
was
false,
and
the
third
statement
was
false,
the
third
representation,
that
there
was
sufficient
assets
there
that
if
anything
went
wrong
with
the
loan
that
weaver
would
collect.
now,
perceiving
that
to
be
a
safe
investment
and
a
safe
transaction,
that's
what
mr.
weaver
in
effect
did.
he
came
in,
he
pledged
it,
and
a
couple
days
prior
to
that
he
had
agreed
to
take
this
profit-sharing
agreement
with
columbus.
now,
you've
got
to
understand
the
fact
that
there
is
absolutely
no
question
we're
here
under
a
rule
56
action
for
summary
judgment,
and
the
facts
are
to
be
construed
favorably
to
the
weavers.
the
weavers
are
elderly
people.
sam
is
over
80
now.
and
to
reasonably
expect
that
he
was
going
to
actively
participate
in
this
business,
a
slaughterhouse
business,
which
is
hard
physical
labor,
for
generating
profits
is
just
unrealistic.
and
those
facts
are
to
be
construed
in
our
favor.
now--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
i
would
say
that
it
was
literally
within
the
act,
but
in
the
context
of
that
transaction
may
not
be
a
security.
the
distinguishing
factor
in
this
case
is
it
is
a
secondary
transaction
that
we're
complaining
about.
we
are
not
complaining
about
the
original
issuance
of
the
certificate
of
deposit,
and
this
distinguishes
many
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
in
this
particular
field.
we're
complaining
about
the
second
transaction,
that
is,
the
transaction
which
was
the
transaction
in
which
he
trades
that
position
for
an
investment
position.
and
i
think
there's
a
distinction
between
the
primary
issuance
situation
and
the
secondary
transaction.
i
think
in
the
primary
issuance
transaction
it
may
literally
fall
within
the
note
or
bond,
or
if
you're
within
the
'33
act
within
the
term
"evidence
of
indebtedness".
but
within
the
context
of
that
particular
issuance,
it
may
not
be
a
security
transaction.
but
in
the
secondary
transaction...
and
we've
cited
the
case
with
meason
v.
bank
of
miami
draw
as
that
distinction,
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
case.
there
is
no
fed
second
citation
because
it's
so
recent.
it's
an
august
or
september
of
1981
decision.
i
don't
think
there's
a
fed
second
citation.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
a
state
claim
has
been
filed,
but
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
problems
there
specifically
because
there
is
a
one-year
statute
for
security
violations
in
pennsylvania.
and
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a
pendant
state
court
claim
attached
to
the
federal
claim,
and
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
this
case
was
not
filed
until
the
eve
of
trial,
which
was
a
couple
years
after
the
events
here;
and
hence,
we
would
be
late
with
regard
to
any
securities
violation
in
the
state
court
even
though
it's
been
filed.
we
have
a
procedure
in
pennsylvania
where
we
file
by
a
summons.
so
there
is
a
substantial
statute
of
limitations
defense.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
i'm
not
conceding
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
we
have
not
pursued
the
state
claim,
that's
correct.
as
you
undoubtedly
know,
in
this
particular
case
the
third
circuit
had
directed
the
district
court
to
hear
the
pendant
state
court
claims
in
this
particular
case.
that
was
dart
of
the
order,
the
reversal
in
this
particular
case
was
to
hear
the
pendant
state
court
claims.
and
under
the
authority
of
rosado
v.
wyman,
which
was
decided
by
this
court,
the
pendant
claim
considering
all
of
the
equities
and
the
circumstances
can
be
heard
by
the
district
court
no
matter
what
this
court
would
do
with
regards
to
either
of
the
securities
contentions
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
i
believe
there's
a
two-year
statute
with
regard--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--yes,
sir.
going
back,
there
was--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
well,
not
in
this
particular
case
they
wouldn't
be
if
they
were
resolved
by
the
district
court
because
they
were
timely
pled
with
the
original
federal
securities
claim.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
that's
correct.
but
if
we
were--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--the
pendant
state
court
claims
in
this
case
were
filed
timely.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
the
problem
was
that
after
the
statute
had
expired
in
the
state
court
proceedings
and
just
on
the
eve
of
the
trial
of
this
particular
case,
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
on
the
entire
case.
and
the
district
court
in
this
particular
case
dismissed
not
only
the
federal
securities
claim
and
also
dismissed
the
pendant
state
court
claim.
now,
going
to
the
question
of
the
certificate
of
deposit
made
reference
to
by
the
bank
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
that
a
change,
that
is,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
a
certificate
of
deposit
is
not
a
security,
that
that
would
be
a
change
in
the
law
as
opposed
to
the
contrary.
and
the
reason
why
i
said
that
is
this.
the
national
bank
administrator
had
specifically
told
the
presidents
of
the
national
banks
back
in
1967
that
time
deposits,
according
to
the
sec,
were
considered
securities
within
the
antifraud
sections
of
the
1933
an
1934
act.
and
that
reference
was
identified
specifically
in
the
federal
register
and
made
reference
to
in
the
amicus
briefs.
so
the
national
banks
at
least
since
1967
up
and
through
the
present
time
have
been
on
notice
that
certificate
of
deposits
were
in
fact
held
to
be
securities
within
the
antifraud
sections
of
the
1933
and
1934
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
just
noted.
it
didn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
it
just
said
in
so
many
words
that
the
sec
at
that
point
in
time
had
taken
the
position
that
the
deposits
and
share
accounts
are
subject
to
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
1934.
and
this
was
also
made
reference
to
in
the...
you
might
have
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
time
deposit
would
be
a
certificate
of
deposit
within
that
context.
and
in
the
superintendent
of
insurance
v.
bankers
life
the
district
court
so
indicated.
it
did
not
express
an
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
certificate
of
deposit
was
a
security,
but
so
indicated
that
that's
what
they
were
alluding
to.
so
if
the
court
would...
it's
our
submission
in
this
case
that
if
you
would
hold
to
the
contrary,
that
it's
not
a
certificate
of
deposit
or
that
it's
not
a
security,
that
that
would
be
a
change
in
the
law,
because
considering
this
has
been
out,
we
would
submit
that
the
banks
have
been
on
notice
at
least
since
that
time
period
that
certificate
of
deposits
would
be
considered
securities
within
the
antifraud
sections
of
the
'33
and
'34
act.
one
other
point--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--to
my
knowledge
they
have
not,
and
to
my
knowledge
the
best
answer
that
i
can
give
to
you
with
regard
to
that
is
that
the
sec
in
various
cases
have
appeared
amicus
taking
various
positions
on
whether
or
not
a
cd
in
the
context
of
a
transaction
is
a
security.
for
example,
in
the
meason
case
v.
bank
of
miami
they
appeared
amicus,
and
in
that
case
it
was
a
secondary
transaction.
they
contended
it
was
a
security
within
these
acts.
and
think
that
in
the
burrus
case
that
after...
there
was
a
burrus
case
that
came
down
that
originally
held
that
a
certificate
of
deposit
was
not
a
security.
they
filed
amicus,
and
subsequently
that
decision
by
the
court
was
withdrawn.
so
at
various
times
they
have
appeared
amicus
and
contended
that
a
certificate
of
deposit
is
a
security.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
i
account
for
it
in
the
following.
i
think
they
filed
a
joint
brief--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--a
joint
brief
between
the
fdic,
the
sec,
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
and
i
think
they
take
the
position
that
it's
in
the
context
of
this
transaction
as
opposed
to
the
literal
question
about
whether
or
not
it's
a
security
for
all
purposes.
and
i
would
say
that
it
sounds
like...
it's
just
a
guess...
that
they
voted
between
the
other
people
that
vote
there
in
the
government.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
i
understand
that.
but
they
say
specifically
in
the
brief,
they
say
specifically
that
it's
only
in
the
context
of
this
transaction
and
not
a
question
whether
or
not
in
other
cases,
because
they're
very
careful
to
say
that
in
other
cases
they
may
take
a
different
position.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
no,
sir.
they
said
that
with
regard
to
the
cd.
one
other
thing
that
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of
is
the
fact
that
the
opposition
has
indicated
that
the
fact
that
the
certificate
of
deposit
is
not
mentioned
specifically
in
the
definition,
that
that
would
indicate
that
because
it's
not
mentioned
specifically
and/or
because
they
mention
the
word
"certificate
of
deposit"
for
a
security,
which
we
acknowledge
is
a
different
instrument,
that
that
would
be
some
indication
that
a
certificate
of
deposit
was
not
meant
to
be
literally
within
the
act.
this
court
in
joiner
in
a
very
similar
issue
specifically
held
that
that
type
of
analysis
was
incorrect.
there
is
a
reference
to
oil
leases,
for
example,
in
joiner,
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
divided
interest
in
oil
leases
as
opposed
to
an
undivided
interest
in
oil
leases
was
a
security.
and
the
court
held
that
just
because
they
were
making
reference
in
the
statute
to
an
undivided
interest
and
that
they
did
not
mention
a
divided
interest,
that
that
did
not
mean
that
the
divided
interest
was
held
to
be
or
would
be
held
to
be
a
security.
in
fact,
the
court
so
held.
now--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--your
honor,
my
understanding
is
on
page
6,
if
you'll
see
that
the...
right
down
at
the
bottom
of
paragraph
2
it
says,
"examination"...
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
my
understanding
is
that
in
the
brief
here...
and
i
have
lost
the
particular
point
where
they
have
said
this...
that
in
this
particular
brief
they
so
indicate
that
they
did
not
want
it
held
for
all
purposes.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
that's
their
position.
i
think
that...
because
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
sec's
position
in
other
cases,
and
specifically
the
bank
of
miami
case
that's
so
recent,
because
they
are--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--and
they
say,
"the
better
reasoned
decisions
of
the
lower
court
did
not
view
the
question
of
whether
a
certificate
of
deposit
is
a
security
in
the
abstract.
"
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
well,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
not
taking
that
firm
a
position,
because
obviously
certificates
of
deposit
can
be
traded
in
all
sorts
of
secondary
transactions.
and
i
think
that
they
recognize
that,
and
i
think
that
if
they
came
out
hard
and
fast
that
there
would
be
all
sorts
of
secondary
transactions;
and
we
just
differ
on
the
facts
in
this
particular
secondary
transaction
as
to
whether
or
not
it
formed
a
consideration
for
an
investment
position.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
well,
one
primary
practical
advantage
is
the
fact
that
in
the
securities
law,
that
is,
in
the
10b
case
or
the
17
case,
it
includes
omissions,
as
opposed
to
commissions;
that
is,
situations
where
a
party
fails
to
disclose,
as
would
apply
to
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
it
would
apply
to
a
situation
where
the
misrepresentation
was
purely
misrepresentation
by
silence,
where
they
failed
to
tell
people
something.
in
this
case
there
is
that
element
in
that.
they
failed
to
tell
the
weavers,
for
example,
in
this
case
that
columbus
was
insolvent
and
was
going
to
be
insolvent
even
though
they
went
through
this
loan
transaction.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
they
may
not
be
a
cause
of
action
under
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania,
because
the
common
law
draws
a
narrower
line
with
regard
to
what
is
an
actionable
fraud.
i
think
the
distinguishing
factor
with
regard
to
this
secondary
transaction,
we
differ
from
the
government
because
i
don't
think
the
government
analyzes
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
to
identify
that
the
bank
specifically
identified
weaver
as
an
investor.
they
in
their
testimony
in
this
case
specifically
identified
weaver
as
an
investor
as
opposed
to
a
guarantor
or
proposed
guarantor.
they
said
he
was
an
investor,
one.
two,
they
said
that
he
was
making
an
investment
transaction.
they
testified
to
that
in
their
pretrial
depositions...
and
we're
entitled
to
the
benefit
or
favorable
construction
of
that...
and
said
that.
they
never
said
that
he
was
just
acting
as
a
guarantor.
and
thirdly,
they
specifically
identified
the
amount
of
his
investment
as
being
$50,000,
and
they
so
stated
in
the
record
in
this
particular
case.
now,
separate
and
apart
from
the
certificate
of
deposit
issue
is
the
related
issue
of
the
piccirillo
agreement,
as
to
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
a
security
within
the
securities
law.
and
we
would
submit
that
it
fits
within
any
one
of
the
one,
two,
or
three
definitions
within
the
subspecies
of
security
such
as
profit-sharing
agreement,
certificate
of
interest,
or
in
fact
an
investment
contract.
and
the
court
has
laid
down
three
basic
guidelines
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
agreement
constitutes
an
investment
contract:
whether
or
not
you
have
an
investment
of
money,
whether
or
not
it's
a
common
enterprise,
and
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
expectation
of
profits
from
the
efforts
of
others.
and
i
think
clearly
in
this
case
that
we
meet
all
of
the
elements.
there
is
no
question
about
it
that
there's
a
$50,000
investment.
the
bank
in
fact
so
stated
that
that
was
a
channel
which
the
money
was
being
channeled
into
columbus.
and
there's
little
question
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
profits
could
be
expected
from
the
efforts
of
piccirillo
and
not
weaver.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
that
he
was
going
to
do
anything
that
was
going
to
contribute
to
the
profits
in
this
case.
the
bank
argues
that
it's
not
a
common
enterprise,
but
the
$50,000
investment
of
mr.
weaver
gets
pooled.
they
say
there
is
no
pooling.
it's
in
fact
pooled
with
the
assets
of
columbus.
it's
no
separated.
it's
co-mingled.
there's
also
another
question
about
whether
or
not
in
this
particular
case,
considering
the
bank
is
in
an
unsecured
position,
their
assets
are
pooled
there,
too.
and
there
were
other
people
who
were
loaning
money,
the
original
seller
of
the
business.
so
if
there
is
a
question
about
just
multiplicity
of
investors
on
a
vertical
standpoint
as
opposed
to...
horizontal,
excuse
me,
as
opposed
to
a
vertical
standpoint--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--that
is,
the
landowner
leases
it
to
the
farmer?
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
that
may
be.
i
think
there's
a
distinction,
and
the
distinction
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--the
distinction
is
that
in
our
case
we
are
contributing...
we
are
making
a...
providing
capital
at
risk--
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
--the
owner
gets
the
land
back,
and
we
don't
get
the
certificate
of
deposit
back
if
the
business
fails.
we
lose
it,
where
the
owner
of
the
land
gets
the
land
back.
he
has
not
made
an
investment
at
risk
like
mr.
weaver
does
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
there
would
be
certain
leasehold
rights,
that
he
would
have
the
right,
assuming
that
there
is
a
written
lease,
he
would
have
certain
rights
to
take
the
land
back.
eventually
he
gets...
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
he
would
get
his
land
back,
and
he
does
not
sake
the
commitment
that
an
investor
makes
when
he
provides
capital
at
risk
that
mr.
weaver
does
in
this
particular
case.
this
particular
case,
the
only
chance
he's
going
to
get
his
deposit
back
is
if
in
fact
columbus
has
sufficient
working
capital
to
make
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
that's
a
possibility,
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
you're
getting
closer
to
that
particular
case,
and
i'm
sure
that
you
can
draw
arrangements
that
get
closer
to
this
particular
situation.
and
i
think
that
we
meet
all
of
the
elements.
the
court
said
they
were
not
dealing
with
a
full
record
in
this
particular
case,
and
the
question
before
the
third
circuit
was
not
whether
or
not
after
a
full
trial
whether
or
not
we
had
met
the
full
definitions
of
an
investment
contract
or
a
profit-sharing
agreement
or
a
certificate
of
interest,
if
you
will,
but
whether
or
not
there
was
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
we
met
those
requirements.
and
we
would
submit
that
on
the
record
before
that
court
and
on
the
record
before
this
court
there's
certainly
an
issue
of
fact.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
see,
the
original
idea
of
this
whole
transaction
was
mr.
weaver
was
just
going
to
give
piccirillo
$50,000,
and
then
he
backed
off
because
of
the
risk
involved,
and
the
bank
became
concerned
and
went
back
and
told,
well,
listen,
there
is
a
less
riskier
way
of
doing
this;
you
give
us
the
$50,000
cd,
we
will
loan
the
business
$65,000.
and
the
bank
was
doing
that,
you
see,
because
that
was
the
only
way
at
that
point
that
they
could
solve
their
own
problems.
and
from
weaver's
standpoint
it
seemed
like
a
relatively
safe
investment,
because
he
sees
somebody
who
he
trusts,
the
bank,
and
they're
telling
him
that
they
have
the
equipment
protected,
that
they're
going
to
give
him
$65,000,
and
the
bank
themselves
said
that
piccirillo
needed
$10,000
to
make
it,
and
the
bank
knew
that
he
wasn't
going
to
get
$10,000.
he
got
$3,800
out
of
a
$65,000
loan.
now,
there
was
just
no
possible
way
that
columbus
was
going
to
make
it;
that
they
were
headed
for
insolvency
or
bankruptcy
irrespective
of
this
loan
transaction.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
certainly
the
courts
have
held
that
risky
loans,
a
long-term
loan
at
risk
is
a
security.
the
second
circuit
specifically,
i
believe
in
the
zeller
case
that's
made
reference
to
in
the
briefs,
has
indicated
that
long-term
loans
like
that
are
securities.
mr.
andrew
j.
conner
no,
no.
i
didn't
say
that.
i'm
sorry.
it's
a
loan
that's
at
risk
where
the
only
chance
of
paying
it
back
is
a
profit
situation,
and
that
was
the
only
chance
in
this
case.
the
only
chance
that
weaver
was
going
to
get
his
certificate
of
deposit
back
is
in
fact
if
columbus
somehow
was
going
to
make
it.
and
so
we
would
submit
that
whether
you
call
it
an
investment
contract
or
whether
you
call
it
a
profit-sharing
agreement
or
a
certificate
of
interest,
that
there
is
at
least
under
rule
56
a
factual
issue
that
would
allow
a
court
or
jury
to
make
a
conclusion
that
investment
contracts
or
one
of
these
other
subspecies
in
fact
exist.
and
i
think
that
the
arguments
about
their
not
being
a
common
enterprise
are
not
correct.
there
was
in
fact
a
pooling
of
assets,
a
true
pooling
of
assets.
there
was
no
specific
segregation
of
weaver's
investment
from
mr.
piccirillo's
investment.
and
certainly
the
third
element
is
made,
would
be
satisfied
in
a
full
trial.
we
would
submit
that
the
third
circuit
is
correct,
that
there
are
factual
support
for
our
position
that
the
piccirillo
agreement
is
a
profit-sharing
agreement
or
a
certificate
of
interest
or
investment
contract;
that
in
this
particular
case
the
third
circuit
is
also
correct
that
the
certificate
of
deposit
in
this
secondary
transaction
was
made
by
an
investor
for
investment
purposes,
that
it
was
in
fact
a
sale.
this
particular
court
held
in
the
rubin
case
that
even
though
it
was
a
loan
transaction,
the
person
got
convicted
under
section
17
when
they
made
a
pledge,
and
that
was
just
as
much
a
commercial
loan
as
this
particular
case.
and
if
it
applies
in
a
criminal
case,
then
it
certainly
would
apply
in
a
civil
case.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
third
circuit
was
correct
in
directing
the
district
court
to
remand
the
case
to
hear
the
pendant
state
court
claims.
and
we
would
submit
that
under
rosado
v.
wyman
that
that
would
be
the
outcome
no
matter
what
this
particular
court
would
decide
on
the
federal
securities
questions.
thank
you
very
much.
