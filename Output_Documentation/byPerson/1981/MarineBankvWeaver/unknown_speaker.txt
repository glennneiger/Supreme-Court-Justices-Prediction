unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
you
haven't
mentioned
the
facts.
you
don't
have
to
because
we
know
what
they
are.
but
you
represent
the
bank
here.
unknown
speaker
these
old
people
are
out
their
$50,000,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
is
the
officer
of
the
bank
who
handled
this
transaction
still
employed
by
the
bank?
unknown
speaker
without
reprimand?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
in
tcherepnin
the
thing
was
more
like
a
share
of
capital
stock?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
question
that
would
be
a
security.
unknown
speaker
has
a
state
action
been
instituted?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
it's
status?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
get
the
latter.
unknown
speaker
no
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
mr.
conner.
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
weavers
had
simply
come
in
and
purchased
a
$50,000
certificate
of
deposit
and
then
later
been
dissatisfied
or
thought
there
were
fraudulent
misrepresentations
in
connection
with
it,
would
you
contend
that
was
a
security?
unknown
speaker
mr.
conner,
i
asked
your
opposition
whether
a
state
claim
had
been
filed.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
conceding
that
that
defense
is
a
good
one?
unknown
speaker
but
you
haven't
pursued
the
state
claim.
unknown
speaker
mr.
conner,
is
there
a
state
common
law
fraud
claim
as
well
as
the
security-type
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
a
one-year
statute
as
to
that
claim?
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
the
same
problem
of
limitation.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
mr.
conner.
i
didn't
understand.
both
these
state
claims
you
say
are
pendant
claims
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
are
they,
too,
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
they
were
decided
as
pendant
claims,
even
though
state
claims,
there
would
be
no
statute
of
limitation.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
because
they
were
filed
in
time.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
did
the
administrator
express
approval
of
that
construction
by
the
sec
or
simply
note
it?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
has
the
sec
ever
changed
its
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
account
for
the
solicitor
general's
brief
then
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
a
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
chief
counsel
of
the
commission
is
on
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
said
that
about
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
mr.
conner,
let
me
call
your
attention
to
page
6
of
the
government's
brief
here
where
they
say
at
the
end
of
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
conclusion
that
the
certificate
of
deposit
involved
here
is
not
a
security
subject
to
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
law
harmonizes
the
federal
securities
and
banking
laws
and
avoids
overlapping
jurisdiction
that
would
"serve
no
general
purpose",
citing
our
daniel
case.
now,
i
had
taken
that
as
a
fairly
explicit
statement
of
their
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
page
22
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
that
where
you
have
a
regulated
bank
you
just
don't
treat
cds
as
securities.
they
didn't
want
any
general
rule
about
certificates
generally
in
unregulated
areas.
but
with
respect
to
a
bank
that's
regulated,
i
thought
they
just
said
put
it
aside;
the
other
laws
will
take
care
of
this,
not
the
securities
laws.
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
that
may
be,
but
what
about
on
page
20
beginning
at
paragraph
4?
that
just
repeats
what
justice
rehnquist
said.
then
it
says,
"the
foregoing
analysis,
however,
may
not
necessarily
apply
in
other
contexts.
"
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i
thought
their
position
was
if
you're
dealing
with
a
regulated
bank,
the
answer
is
clear.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
practical
advantages
of
proceeding
under
the
act
as
opposed
to
in
the
state
causes
of
action?
unknown
speaker
and
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
conner,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
if
one
owned
farmlands
and
leased
the
lands
to
a
farmer,
the
compensation
to
be
a
division
of
profits
or
a
share
of
the
profits
under
the
lease
arrangement,
would
that
be
analogous
to
the
contract
you
are
discussing
here
this
morning?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
the
compensation
to
the
landowner
is
a
share
in
the
profits,
a
very
common
arrangement.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
distinction?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
land
in
the
example
i
put?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
lease
is
for
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
in
the
example
i
put,
the
owner
of
the
land
might
receive
no
profits
whatever
for
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing...
to
modify
justice
powell's
example
a
little
bit...
supposing
in
addition
to
the
arrangement
with
the
tenant
who
would
work
the
land
and
provide
a
profit,
they
then
pledged
or
mortgaged
the
land
to
the
bank
and
borrowed
the
working
capital
to
buy
the
farm
equipment.
then
i
suppose
you'd
have
the
same
case,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
to
make
the
investment
contract
aspect
of
this
case
a
security
you
must
have
as
a
part
of
the
overall
transaction
a
pledge
of
the
certificate
of
deposit?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
bank
had
made
misrepresentations
about
this
company
and
convinced
the
people
to
make
a
loan
directly
to
the
company,
same
result?
say
you
took
back
a
note
from
the
company.
unknown
speaker
so
any
note
issued
by
a
borrower
may
be
a
security?
