mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
two
separate
and
distinct
instruments:
one,
an
fdic-insured
certificate
of
deposit
in
the
amount
of
$50,000
bearing
interest
at
7
1/2
percent
and
maturing
in
six
years;
secondly,
an
agreement
between
a
loan
customer
of
the
bank
and
a
guarantor
of
the
customer's
loan
to
the
bank
about
which
the
bank
had
no
knowledge
at
the
time
the
loan
was
made.
petitioner
marine
bank
requests
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
which
found
that
both
instruments
were
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
definitions
of
the
'33
and
'34
acts.
the
fdic-insured
certificate
of
deposit
is
not
specifically
mentioned
as
an
enumerated
item
in
the
'33
and
'34
act
definitions.
however,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
applied
several
tests:
one,
the
"any
note"
test:
and
secondly,
whether
it
was
an
investment
contract.
in
the
investment
contract
issue,
the
howey
case
decided
by
this
court
clearly
establishes
what
the
test
is
and
has
been
since
1946,
and
that
test
was
further
elaborated
upon
by
this
court
in
the
tcherepnin
case
cited
a
few
years
later;
and
that
test
being
a
document
is
a
security
if
it's
a
contract,
transaction
or
scheme
whereby
a
person
invests
money
in
a
common
enterprise
with
the
profits
to
come
solely
from
the
efforts
of
others.
we
believe
that
that
test
has
been
misapplied
by
the
circuit
court,
and
there
are
three
circuit
court
decisions,
in
the
fourth,
fifth
and
seven
circuits:
the
burrus
case
in
the
fourth,
the
bellah
case
in
the
fifth,
and
the
fingland
case
in
the
seventh,
which
hold
that
certificates
of
deposit
are
not
securities
within
the
meaning
of
those
cases
of
this
court.
is
it
any
note?
the
statutes
say
unless
the
context
otherwise
requires
any
note
and
so
forth.
is
the
cd
any
note?
in
this
event
we'd
like
you
to
address
the
matter
the
way
you
did
in
the
daniel
case
which
looked
at
the
substance
of
the
transaction
and
not
what
it
is
called.
if
you
look
at
the
substance
in
daniel,
as
you
did,
you
found
that
a
pension
plan
document
did
not
establish
a
security.
now,
the
third
circuit
here
said
that
this
was
functionally
the
equivalent
of
a
corporate
note.
we
don't
believe
that
that's
correct.
a
corporate
note
contains
an
earnings
risk
and
a
risk
of
repayment.
this
fdic-secured
certificate
of
deposit
does
not
have
a
payment
or
repayment
risk
being
an
insured
deposit,
and
it
has
a
fixed
rate
of
interest.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
yes,
i
do.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
well,
there
was
recovery,
your
honor,
mr.
justice,
against
other
collateral,
but
there
would
be
a
substantial
portion
of
that
lost,
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
yes,
he
is.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
he
has
not
been
reprimanded,
to
my
knowledge.
i
believe
the
third
circuit
erred
in
its
analogy
calling
this
an
investment
contract.
the
tcherepnin
case
held
there
was
no
voting...
the
fact
of
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
voting
right
connected
with
the
instrument
is
important.
in
tcherepnin
that
was
a
savings
and
loan
certificate
which
contained
the
element
of
voting.
the
cd
contains
no
element
of
voting.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
yes.
it
was
more
like
an
investment
in
a
savings
and
loan.
the
savings
and
loan
had
no
other
investment
vehicle
other
than
selling
shares
or
investment
certificates
as
they
were
called
in
tcherepnin.
but
in
this
case
the
bank
has,
of
course,
capital
stock
issued
pursuant
to
the
pennsylvania
banking
laws,
which
is
where
the
investment
would
be
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
that
certainly
is
a
security.
the
legislative
history
of
the
enactment
of
the
'33,
i
believe,
and
'34
acts,
in
the
congressional
hearings
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
banking
industry
clearly
said
that
the
stock
of
a
national
bank
would
be
an
investment.
in
looking
at
this
you
might
think
of
it
as
to
whether
it's
a
commercial
instrument
or
an
investment
instrument.
we
believe
that
commercial
instruments
are
not
covered
by
the
securities
definitions
and
investment
instruments
are.
legislatively,
the
'33
and
'34
acts
were
part
of
a
package
of
acts
that
were
enacted
in
those
years
and
which
regulated
banking
in
several
respects.
one
was
the
glass-steagall
act
and
another
was
the
fdic
act.
now,
those
acts
provided
a
parallel
system
of
regulation
of
banking
in
this
country,
that
is
to
say,
federally
regulated
banking
institutions,
through
the
fdic
or
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
the
legislative
history
of
the
glass-steagall
act
shows
that
there
was
an
attempt
when
it
was
passed
to
separate
banking
from
investment
activities.
and
the
third
circuit,
we
believe,
erred
in
blurring
that
distinction
and
putting
it
back
together
again.
the
respondent
weaver
does
have
a
remedy.
the
pennsylvania
securities
act,
as
referenced
in
the
complaint
of
the
respondent
filed
in
the
district
court,
does
claim
account
under
the
pennsylvania
securities
act
where
there
is
essentially
the
same
language
as
rule
10b-5.
also,
there
is
a
pennsylvania
common
law
fraud
count
alleged.
both
of
those
are
pendant
claims,
and
so
there
is
a
state
court
remedy
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
yes,
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
we
understand
it's
been
filed.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
been
served.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
i
understand
it
has
been
filed.
i
do
not
believe
it
has
been
served.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
i
wouldn't
express
an
opinion
on
that.
there
probably
is
a
question
on
that.
is
the
piccirillo
agreement
an
investment
contract?
i
think
there
are
four
elements
of
investment
contract
that
need
to
be
looked
at.
one,
is
there
a
multiple
investor
situation?
there
is
none
here.
is
there
a
pooling
of
funds?
was
there
a
public
offering?
none
here.
was
it
solely
from
the
efforts
of
the
promoter
piccirillo?
no,
for
two
reasons.
this
agreement
provided
that
mr.
weaver
could
pasture
his
cows
and
use
the
barn
of
mr.
piccirillo.
and
secondly,
and
very
most
importantly,
he
could
veto
any
future
loans
in
mr.
piccirillo's
business.
so
it
was
not
solely
from
the
efforts
of
the
promoter
piccirillo.
even
if...
and
don't
admit
that
it
is...
but
even
if
this
piccirillo
agreement
is
a
security,
the
bank
had
no
knowledge
of
it.
the
depositions
of
both
mr.
weaver
and
mrs.
weaver,
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
and
quoted
in
most
of
the
briefs,
clearly
established
that
they
did
not
tell
marine
bank
of
the
existence
of
this
side
agreement
between
them:
and
marine
bank
therefore
cannot
be
held
under
the
ernst
and
ernst
case
decided
in
this
court
as
an
aider
and
abettor
in
the
securities
fraud
which
has
been
alleged.
we
can't
predicate
10b-5
liability
on
the
alleged
negligence
of
failure
to
inquire
about
something
we
didn't
know
was
there.
the
closest
case
in
the
circuit
court
is
in
the
fifth
circuit,
a
case
of
woodward
v.
metro
bank
cited
about
five
years
ago.
whether
a
cd
or
the
piccirillo
agreement
is
or
is
not
a
security
is
a
matter
of
law
and
not
of
fact.
the
circuit
court
erred
in
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
remanding
for
trial.
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
and
is
the
proper
method
to
resolve
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
the
broad
security
definition
cited
by
judge
gibbons
at
the
conclusion
of
the
third
circuit
opinion
is
clearly
in
error.
the
sec
agrees,
as
do
the
other
regulatory
authorities,
as
to
the
result
in
this
case.
under
the
analysis
of
howey,
tcherepnin
and
daniel
cases
in
this
court,
these
two
instruments
are
not
securities
and
cannot
be
the
basis
of
10b-5
liability
or
a
10b-5
claim.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
i
didn't
ask
for
any
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
will
accept
your
invitation
to
make
one
comment.
mr.
daniel
l.
r.
miller
i'll
say
that
there
are
a
series
of
cases,
the
note
and
mortgage
cases,
and
all
of
them
in
the
circuit
courts
have
decided
generally
that
a
note
and
mortgage
situation
referenced
by
justice
powell
and
justice
stevens
were
not
securities.
in
response
to
one
of
the
questions
concerning
the
existence
of
the
state
court
action,
it
is
my
clear
understanding
that
the
cases
were
filed
in
the
state
court
on
a
timely
basis
but
were
not
served
on
marine
bank
on
a
timely
basis,
and
therefore,
they
are
out
of
time
as
far
as
state
court
action
goes.
thank
you.
