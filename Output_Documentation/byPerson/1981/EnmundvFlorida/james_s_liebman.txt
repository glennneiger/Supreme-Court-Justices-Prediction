mr.
james
s.
liebman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner,
earl
enmund,
has
been
sentenced
by
the
state
of
florida
to
be
executed
for
the
crime
of
murder.
now,
two
factual
determinations
of
the
florida
supreme
court
surrounding
mr.
enmund's
actual
involvement
in
that
crime
are
critical
here,
and
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
to
summarize
those
findings.
first,
the
florida
supreme
court
determined
that
earl
enmund
did
not
himself
take
life.
rather,
it
determined
that
sampson
armstrong,
mr.
enmund's
confederate
in
a
robbery,
killed
both
of
the
victims,
that
is,
mr.
thomas
kersey
and
mrs.
eunice
kersey,
in
an
exchange
of
gunfire
that
was
initiated
by
mrs.
kersey.
the
florida
supreme
court
determined
that
during
these
events
and
during
the
robbery,
petitioner
was
not
on
the
scene
but
was
200
yards
away
in
the
get-away
car.
more
importantly,
the
florida
supreme
court
secondly
expressly
determined
that
the
killings
committed
by
sampson
armstrong
were
not
intended
or
contemplated
as
a
part
of
the
robbery
scheme
with
which
mr.
enmund
had
associated
himself
and
had
helped
plan.
rather,
the
florida
supreme
court,
in
its
own
words,
determined
that
those
killings
by
sampson
armstrong
"were
spontaneous
and
were
precipitated
by
the
armed
resistance
of
mrs.
kersey.
"
again,
at
a
time
when
earl
enmund
was
200
yards
away,
and
was
not
at
all
able
to
take
any
part
in
that
spontaneous
decision
by
sampson
armstrong
to
return
mrs.
kersey's
fire.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no,
your
honor.
the
evidence
on
the
gun
is...
on
the
guns
is
extremely
confused.
in
fact,
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
both
in
the
opening
argument
and
in
the
closing
argument
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
tell
them
anything
about
the
guns
or
even
how
many
guns
there
were.
they
didn't
know
that.
now,
all
we
know
is
that
sampson
armstrong
had
a
gun
and
mrs.
kersey
had
a
gun.
beyond
that--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--two,
at
least
two.
there
were
some
bullets
that
they
did
not
trace
to
either
gun,
but
they
couldn't
tell
whether
they
were
from
those
guns
or
others.
they
just
couldn't
do
a
ballistics
test.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
that
is
unclear
also,
but
there
were
at
least
sampson
armstrong,
jeanette
armstrong
and
earl
enmund,
and
possibly
ida
jean
shaw,
and
then
there
was
mr.
and
mrs.
kersey
at
the
scene.
one
other
fact
that
i
should
mention
is
that
sampson
armstrong
told
j.b.
neil,
his
friend,
who
testified
at
trial
against
sampson,
that
both
sampson
and
jeanette
armstrong
had
guns.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
there's
a
reasonable
inference
that
there
were
at
least
two.
i
think
the
state's
statement
to
the
jury
that
it
couldn't--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no.
no,
your
honor.
i
misspoke
if
i
said
that.
there
were
two
that
they
could
identify,
and
all
of
the
other
bullets
could
have
come
from
one
of
those
two
guns.
they
just
couldn't
determine
it,
because
those
bullets
were
too
injured
to
allow
conclusive
ballistics
determinations.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
mr.
kersey
was
shot
twice.
mrs.
kersey
was
shot
six
times.
they
found
a
total
of
nine
bullets,
those
eight
plus
an
additional
ninth
bullet,
but
they
could
only
do
successful
ballistics
tests
on
five
of
the
bullets.
now,
in
order
to
affirm
petitioner's
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
on
those
findings
that
i
just
mentioned,
the
florida
supreme
court
found
it
necessary
and
said
that
it
found
it
necessary
to
rely
on
two
what
it
has
called
in
the
past
constructive
devices,
and
to
establish
murder,
the
court
first
relied
on
florida's
constructive
malice
doctrine.
under
that
doctrine,
a
person
who
is
engaged
in
a
robbery
who
kills
is
conclusively
presumed,
despite
any
other
evidence,
to
be...
to
have
intended
that
death,
and
thus
to
be
a
murderer.
the
court
then
applied
florida's
accessorial
rule
under
which
all
of
the
robbery
confederates
who
are
either
actually
or,
as
the
florida
supreme
court
determined
was
actually
the
case
here,
are
only
constructively
present
at
the
time
the
killings
took
place
are
also
conclusively
presumed
to
have
an
intent
to
kill,
and
therefore
to
be
murderers.
now,
i
want
to
stress
that
under
the
florida
rule,
including,
and
this
is
stated
in
the
pope
case
which
is
cited
repeatedly
by
the
supreme
court
in
affirming
petitioner's
conviction,
and
also
the
hampton
case,
and
both
of
those
cases
are
cited
on
page
13
of
our
opening
brief,
the
florida
courts
have
clearly
held
that
in
a
case
in
which
the
jury
would
find
that
there
is
no
foreseeability
that
the
deaths
would
occur,
that
there
was
no
contemplation
by
the
accomplices
of
any
possible
death,
even
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
florida's
felony
murder
rule
and
its
accessorial
rules
apply.
now,
in
this
record,
mr.
enmund's
principal
submission,
which
we
have
set
out
in
point
1
of
our
opening
brief,
is
that
execution
is
an
excessive
and
disproportionate
punishment,
in
violation
of
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
for
one
who
did
not
himself
take
life,
attempt
or
assist
in
taking
life,
and
for
one
who
did
not
intend
that
life
be
taken
by
another.
now,
at
the
outset
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
petitioner's
submission
here
does
not
in
any
way
challenge
florida's
authority
to
devise
rules
governing
accessorial
liability
or
its
ability
to
define
the
crime
of
felony
murder
or
to
punish
those
crimes
severely,
but
petitioner's
first
submission
does
raise
the
single
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
inflicting
the
one
punishment,
the
unique
punishment
of
death
on
one
who
has
not
taken
part
in
a
design
himself
to
take
life
or
to
have
it
taken
by
another.
and
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
question,
that
death
is
a
disproportionate
punishment
in
that
situation,
is
mandated
by
this
court's
prior
decision,
the
logic
of
its
decision
in
coker
versus
georgia.
in
coker,
the
court
decided
a
question
that
gregg
versus
georgia
had
left
open,
and
that
was
whether
there
are
certain
crimes
short
of
deliberate
homicide
committed
by
the
defendant
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
the
states
from
punishing
by
death,
and
indeed,
the
court
determined
in
coker
that
ehrlich
coker
could
not
constitutionally
be
executed
for
the
serious,
in
fact,
the
often
life-threatening
crime
of
rape,
even
where
that
crime
in
that
particular
case
had
been
carried
out
in
part
by
the
offender
holding
a
knife
to
the
victim's
throat
during
the
rape.
now,
the
crucial
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
in
condemning
earl
enmund
to
death,
the
state
of
florida
has
proved
nothing
more
on
his
part
than
a
degree
of
participation
in
the
crime
of
robbery
that
is
identical
to
ehrlich
coker's
degree
of
participation
in
the
crime
of
rape.
insofar
as
anything
the
two
men
did
or
intended
or
even
foresaw,
they
are
the
same.
now,
here
it
is
true
that
two
deaths
occurred,
but
i
want
to
stress,
i
think
it
is
important
for
purposes
of
eighth
amendment
decision-making
here
that
that
was
at
the
hands
and
at
the
decision
of
sampson
armstrong,
and
as
the
florida
supreme
court
expressly
determined,
that
was
not
by
any
design
or
act
on
earl
enmund's
part,
apart
from
being
himself
a
part
of
the
robbery,
and
therefore
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
florida
courts
all
the
way
along,
the
instructions,
in
order
to
link
mr.
enmund
to
those
deaths,
they
could
not
rely
on
anything
he
did
or
intended,
and
they
did
not
purport
to.
rather,
they
linked
him
to
those
deaths
solely
by
virtue
of
the
constructive
malice
and
constructive
presence
devices.
those
are
the
only
links,
and
those
are
the
links
that
the
florida
supreme
court
expressly
relied
on.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
the
first
point,
your
honor,
is
that
on
the
instructions
given
here,
the
jury
was
not
asked
to
confront
that
point
and
made
no
finding
on
it,
and
the--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
on
the
proof
that
we
have
in
this
case,
that
would
be
a
difficult
inference
for
the
jury
to
draw.
i
don't
know
if
i
can
say
it
would
be
an
irrational
inference,
but
it
would
be
extremely
difficult,
because
the
only
time
the
state
actually
connected
mr.
enmund
to
those
guns
was
two
days
later,
when
he
participated
in
a
plan
with
sampson
armstrong
and
ida
jean
shaw
to
dispose
of
the
weapons.
now,
we
know
something
about
the
calibers.
we
know
that
there
was
a.22-caliber
gun,
and
that
that
belonged
to
ida
jean
shaw.
she
disposed
of
that
weapon
and
said
it
was
her
gun.
she
also
said
that
the.38-caliber
weapon
that
she
disposed
of
was
one
that
she
had
seen
in
the
hands
of
either
sampson
armstrong
or
jeanette
armstrong
some
time
before
these
events
occurred.
so,
all
of
the
evidence
is
at
least
consistent,
with
the
possibility
that
those
guns
were
on
the
persons
only
of
the
armstrongs
and
mrs.
kersey,
and
that
petitioner
didn't
know,
and
of
course
the
jury
here
was
instructed
that
if
there
are
two
possible
inferences
that
it
can
draw
from
the
evidence,
you
know,
equally
strong,
then
it
must
draw
the
inference
in
favor
of
the
defense,
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
instruction
here
would
make
it
quite
difficult
for
the
jury
to
determine
that
earl
enmund
knew
something
about
the
guns.
but,
of
course,
in
any
event,
the
jury
was
not
asked
here
to
make
any
determination
about
the
guns.
the
state
said
it
couldn't
really
prove
very
much
about
the
guns,
and
it
just
didn't
have
to,
because
the
felony
murder
rule
that
it
was
acting
under
allowed
it
not
to
have
to
prove
that
sort
of
thing.
and
i
want
to
stress
that
for
purposes
of
criminal
liability
and
for
purposes
of
severe
punishment,
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
vicarious
devices
and
these
conclusive
presumptions
that
the
florida
supreme
court
relied
upon
are
perfectly
okay
to
establish
a
nexus
between
what
the
offender
actually
did
and
these
killings,
but
here
the
punishment
is
death,
and
in
that
qualitatively
different
situation,
the
eighth
amendment
implies
it
requires
that
the
courts
apply
qualitatively
different
standards.
and
in
particular,
as
this
court
stated
so
recently
in
eddings
versus
oklahoma,
what
the
eighth
amendment
requires
in
death
penalty
cases
is
a
sensibility
to
the
uniqueness
of
the
individual
offender.
what
this
court
repeatedly
has
called
in
woodson,
roberts,
lockett,
a
concern,
a
concern
for
the
individual
culpability
of
that
offender
for
his
particular
offense,
and
for
his
particular
character,
and
what
we
suggest
here
is
that
that
crucial
eighth
amendment
concern
in
death
penalty
cases
for
individual
culpability
simply
will
not
permit
the
gap
between
what
earl
enmund
actually
did
and
intended
here
as
a
robbery
and
the
kerseys'
deaths
at
the
hands
of
sampson
armstrong
to
be
bridged
by
nothing
more
than
what
is
really
a
legal
fiction.
in
short,
the
eighth
amendment
requires
that
actual
individual
culpability
be
the
touchstone
of
how
we
determine
who
lives
and
who
dies.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
let
me
explain
why
i
call
it
that,
because
i
did
carefully
use
those
terms.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
stated
that
even
in
a
case
where
it
is
in
fact
provable
and
the
defendant
could
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
did
not
intend
death,
that
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
reasonable
likelihood
of
death,
that
no
death
was
contemplated,
even
in
that
situation,
the
felony
murder
presumption,
conclusive
presumption
of
malice
applies,
and
in
that
case,
where
the
defendant
could
make
that
proof,
it
has
to
be
a
fiction,
because
the
jury
could
be
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
no
intent,
there
was
no
malice,
and
yet
they
would
be
forced
to
find
malice.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
your
honor,
that's
why
i
say
that
that
type
of
reasoning
is
okay.
there
is
no
constitutional
wrong
there
so
far
as
finding
criminal
liability
or
even
punishing
the
person
with
a
severe
term
of
years,
but
where
the
problem
comes
in
with
that
is
in
the
eighth
amendment
area,
where
the
death
penalty
is
involved,
because
there
individual
culpability
must
be
crucial,
and
we
can't
just
say
that
because
in
most
cases
this
would
be
true,
we
are
going
to
presume
that
it
is
true
in
all
cases.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that's
true,
but
the
reasons
that
are
held
out,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
those
reasons
in
the
eighth
amendment
area,
where
the
death
penalty
is
imposed,
is
inconsistent
with
the
requirement
of
focusing
on
individual
culpability
in
determining
who
lives
and
who
dies.
now,
to
take
your
example,
ehrlich
coker
went
into
a
rape.
he
held
a
knife
to
the
victim's
throat.
he
committed
a
crime
for
which
death
was
a
foreseeable
result.
there
is
no
question
on
the
facts
of
coker
that
death
was
a
foreseeable
result,
and
georgia
argued
because
of
that
that
that
was
a
crime
that
serious
harm
or
death
was
so
likely
that
they
should
be
able
to
punish
it
severely,
as
if
death
had
occurred,
and
this
court--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--he
is
guilty
of
murder.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no,
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear
over
and
over
again.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
the
punishment
for
felony
murder
in
florida,
where
there
is
no
death
penalty,
is
life
in
prison
without
possibility
of
parole
for
25
years.
mr.
enmund
is
at
this
point--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--it
is
life
in
prison
without
possibility
of
parole
for
25
years.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
after
25
years,
the
parole
board
then
can
exercise
its
discretion.
and
for
purposes
of
that
punishment
or
even
a
mandatory
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
any
parole--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem
with
what
has
happened
here.
i
think
that
the
woodson
case
makes
it
quite
clear
that
while
we
have
no
problem
with
mandatory
sentences,
mandatory
severe
sentences
where
the
death
penalty
is
not
involved;
where
the
death
penalty
is
involved,
we
have
a
different
issue,
and
what
i
am
arguing
here
is
that
where
you
have
that
different
issue,
and
the
crucial
part
of
that
different
issue
is
individual
culpability,
when
we
are
separating
who
lives
and
who
dies,
we
must
look
at
the
individual
culpability
of
the
offender.
and
when
we
look
at
the
individual
culpability
of
earl
enmund
and
ehrlich
coker,
it
is
indistinguishable.
the
two
culpabilities
of
the
two
men
are
indistinguishable,
and
therefore
on
this
individual
culpability
measure
the
eighth
amendment
simply
cannot
rationally
be
seen
as
tolerating
mr.
enmund's
sentence
of
death
at
the
same
time
as
it
conclusively
and
for
all
cases
says
that
mr.
coker
cannot
be
punished
by
death.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
you
are
assuming,
i
think,
by
that
statement
that
there
was
a
but
for
connection
between
mr.
enmund
and
the
death,
and
even
that
has
not
been
proved
as
a
matter
of
florida
law.
all
you
need
to
do
is
prove
that
he
took
part
in
a
robbery,
and
that
a
death
occurred
as
part
of
that
robbery.
but
there
is
no
proof
here...
they
left
mr.
enmund
out
at
the
car.
he
knew
the
kerseys,
so
they
left
him
out
at
the
car,
because
he
could
be
identified,
but
there
is
no
proof
here
that
they
wouldn't
have
left
him
at
home
and
gone
ahead
and
done
it
if
he
didn't
go
along.
so
that
even
on
that
assumption
you
don't
have
that
proof
here,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
death
is
not...
it
cannot
be
enough.
otherwise,
if
we
had...
we
could
have
the
death
penalty
for
negligent
vehicular
homicide,
or
for
a
person
who
jaywalks
negligently,
steps
out
in
front
of
a
car,
the
car
swerves
to
avoid
him,
and
there
is
a
death.
there
is
a
causation.
there
is
a
criminal
violation
by
jaywalking,
and
there
is
a
death
there,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
death
penalty
simply
would
be...
would
be
too
extreme
a
penalty
for
that
crime.
what
this
case...
this
court's
cases
have
looked
at
very
clearly
is
not
the
disembodied
injury,
but
the
injury
caused
by
the
design
of
the
offender.
it
looks
to
the
connection
between
the
offender's
design,
his
acts
that
he
took
in
furtherance
of
that
design
and
the
harm
that
results,
and
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
that
the
connection
between
the
design
with
which
petitioner
took
place,
that
is,
a
design
to
commit
a
robbery,
the
connection
between
that
and
the
killings
is
purely
by
virtue
of
these
constructive
malice
devices.
the
florida
supreme
court
had
nothing
else
to
go
on,
and
in
that
sense
there
is
no
difference
between
ehrlich
coker,
who
did
everything
that
earl
enmund
did,
but
there
was
no
death
resulting
at
the
hands
or
by
the
decision
of
somebody
else,
but
in
terms
of
individual
culpability,
ehrlich
coker
did
everything,
thought
everything,
foresaw
everything
that
earl
enmund
did,
and
if
the
constitution...
if
the
eighth
amendment
with
its
crucial
focusing
on
individual
culpability,
says
that
mr.
coker
falls
below
the
line
and
cannot
be
constitutionally--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--i
would
be
glad
to.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
in
our
submission,
the
culpability
that
should
be
the
determining
factor
is
the
intent
to
take
life,
conscious
purpose
to
take
life
as
you
defined
it
in
your
concurring
decision
in
lockett.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
your
honor,
at
common
law,
at
the
common
law--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--we...
our
submission
is
that
in
that
situation,
the
person
has...
he
has
intended
death,
if
only
in
a
conditional
circumstance.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
but
he
has
intended
death,
and
therefore
he
falls
above
the
line,
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
common
law
rule.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
is
correct.
or...
it
can't
come
down
to
him
saying
it.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
it
would
be
a
jury
question
as
to
whether--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--he
had
actually
thought
that,
or
had
been--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--exactly,
your
honor,
which
is
precisely
what
every
case
on
intent
entails.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
on
this
record,
i
think
would
it
be
an
extremely
close
question,
and
the
reason
that
i
say
that,
it
is
not
only
my
reading
of
the
record,
but
as
i
read
the
florida
supreme
court
decision,
they
looked
into
the
question
of
intent,
they
looked
into
the
question
on
this
record
of
the
design
with
which
mr.
enmund
had
taken
part,
because
intent
was
relevant
at
various
points
of
their
analysis.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
and
what
they
said
was,
repeatedly,
he
involved
himself
in
a
design
to
rob,
and
they
used
those
terms
several
times,
49
through
50
of
the
appendix,
and
they
determined
that
the
deaths
that
occurred
occurred
spontaneously
at
sampson
armstrong's
decision.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
as
to
sampson
armstrong
that
you
couldn't
say
that
there
was
an
intent,
but
they
occurred
spontaneously
at
a
time
when
earl
enmund
was
no
more
part
of
the
enterprise,
and
therefore,
because
the
intent
to
kill
or
whatever
state
of
mind
there
was
arose
at
that
time,
when
earl
enmund
was
no
more
on
the
scene
and
couldn't
have
participated
in
it,
for
that
reason,
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
proposition,
to
find
intent,
when
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court,
looking
at
the
record,
has
said
that
there
is
no
intent.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
there
can
be
an
inference
drawn
from
the
fact
that
he
pulled
the
trigger--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--that
he
intended,
but
there
could
be
an
inference
drawn
from
many
other
factors
even
if
he
doesn't
pull
the
trigger.
i
would
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
cardoza
opinion
for
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
people
versus
emialeta.
it
had
to
look
at
precisely
this
question.
there
were
several
people
involved,
and
did
they
all
intend
death,
and
judge
cardoza
for
that
court
determined
that
they
did,
looking
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
the
non-trigger
men
plus
the
trigger
men
were
found
to
have
participated
in
a
design
to
kill.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
your
honor,
in
that
situation,
it
would
be
a
jury
question,
and
as
you
said
in
coker,
the
jury
system
is
designed
and
operates
successfully
to
decide
just
that
question.
you
give
them
a
standard
and
you
give
them
the
facts.
but
if
the
jury
determined,
and
i
don't
think
juries
are
quick
to
believe
this
kind
of
thing,
but
if
the
jury
did
determine
that
it
was
pure
accident,
that
there
was
no
intent,
then
the
death
penalty
would
be
inappropriate
because
the
jury
would
have
thereby
decided
that
this
person
was
not
at
the
intent
level
of
culpability,
but
fell
way
below
it.
it
fell
at
a
much
lower
point
because
there
was
not
an
intent,
and
criminal
law
has
long
recognized
that
the
difference
between
intent
and
non-intent
is
a
big
step.
it
is
the
widest
divide
that
we
have
in
our
mental
states
that
we
look
at
in
criminal
law,
and
therefore,
by
finding
that
this
person
was
below
that
divide,
i
think
that
they
would
be
finding
a
very,
very
different
level
of
culpability
that
if
the
i
person
had
intent.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
foreseeability
of
the
harm,
particularly
because
ehrlich
coker
had
not
only
carried
the
knife
but
wielded
it
and
used
it
in
a
way
that
was
very
dangerous.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that's
true,
although
he
did
hold
it
to
the
victim's
throat,
and--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--created
a
very
dangerous
situation.
i
think
that
i
have
laid
out
our
principal
submission
under
coker,
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
begin
with,
i
was
rather
startled
that
mr.
kaden
argued
or
appeared
to
be
arguing
that
earl
enmund
was
inside
that
house,
and
that
the
trial
court
made
the
correct
finding
on
that.
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
state
of
florida
took
the
following
position
about
the
facts
of
mr.
enmund's
participation
in
the
case.
i
am
reading
from
their
brief
on
appeal
at
page
33:
"appellant
enmund
in
this
case,
being
constructively
present
some
200
yards
away
and
aiding
in
the
escape,
was
therefore
a
second
degree
principal,
and
therefore
guilty
under
florida's
felony
murder
rule.
"
they
argued
there
and
they
took
the
position
that
the
facts
were
only
enough
to
support
exactly
what
the
florida
supreme
court
found,
that
he
wasn't
at
the
house,
that
he
was
200
yards
away,
and
i
just
think
that
if
the
court
reviews
the
record,
it
will
see
that
the
florida
supreme
court,
whose
findings
are
do
respect,
as
this
court
held,
for
example,
in
sumner
v.
mada
so
recently,
that
those
findings
are
absolutely
correct
on
the
record,
and
the
state
took
that
position
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
now,
turning
to
justice
o'connor's
argument
or
question
during
my
opponent's
argument,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
page
55
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
tan
appendix.
on
that
page,
the
florida
supreme
court
finds
that
two
of
the
four
aggravating
circumstances
that
the
trial
court
had
found
were
not
present
in
the
case,
and
then
it
cites
the
elledge
case
in
the
middle.
the
elledge
case
is
the
florida
rule
that
if
there
are
any
aggravating
circumstances
that
are
rejected
and
there
is
any
mitigating
evidence,
any
mitigating
circumstance
at
all,
then
you
have
to
remand
for
resentencing.
and
what
did
the
florida
supreme
court
say,
having
wiped
out
two
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
the
case
and
then
applying
the
elledge
rule?
it
said,
and
i
am
quoting,
and
this
is
from
the
very
last
two
sentences
on
the
page,
"the
finding"...
it's
referring
to
the
trial
court's
finding...
"the
finding
that
no
mitigating
circumstances
were
present
was
not
error.
"
"therefore,
the
sentence
of
death
is
appropriate,
and
we
approve
it.
"
they
found
not
that
there
was
some
mitigating
circumstances
or
whatever,
they
found
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances.
they
say
it
no
less
than
three
times
on
that
page.
sandra
lockett
helped
plan
the
murder
in
the
lockett
case.
she
pointed
out
the
store,
the
pawn
shop
that
was
robbed.
sandra
lockett
hid
a
gun
from
the
police
while
the
police
were
searching
a
taxicab
she
was
in.
sandra
lockett
hid
two
of
her
cohorts
in
the
attic
when
the
police
were
searching
her
house.
and
yet
this
court
held,
and
even
in
justice
blackmun's
more
narrow
rule
in
the
lockett
case,
that
the
lack
of
involvement
in
the
homicide
and
i
am
quoting
justice
blackmun's
opinion
there,
it's
"involvement
in
the
homicide
was
a
mitigating
circumstance
that
if
no
other
circumstance
was
considered
had
to
be
considered.
"
and
here,
i
think,
in
black
and
white,
at
least
three
different
occasions
on
page
55,
the
court
has
said
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances,
that
it
did
not
consider
those.
moving
to
a
question
that
your
honor,
chief
justice
asked--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
they
do
define
in
the
statute
that
there
are
eight
mitigating
circumstances,
but--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--that's
right,
but
the
way
that--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
as
i...
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
florida
rule,
it
is
not
mitigating
circumstances
within
the
statute,
but
mitigating
circumstances.
but
in
any
case,
for
the
court
to
turn
dire
consequences
on
whether
there
are
mitigating
circumstances
but
they
are
statutory
or
non-statutory,
i
think,
would
also
violate
the
principle
in
lockett
that
all
of
these
mitigating
circumstances
have
to
be
considered,
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
what
the
trial
court
found,
and
i
believe
that
this
is
on
page
34,
if
i
am
not...
well,
it's
on
page
28.
"the
court
can
find
no
mitigating
circumstances
as
it
applies
to
this
defendant.
"
that
is
what
the
trial
court
said.
that
is
the
finding
that
the
surpeme
court
said
was
not
in
error,
and
based
on
which
it
affirmed.
if
i
could
turn
for
just
a
moment
to
a
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
about
a
statute
saying
that
guns
would
be
enough,
if
guns
were
involved
and
everybody
knew
about
it,
could
that
be
enough.
my
opponent
also
mentioned
senate
bill
114
and
the
model
penal
code.
all
of
those
examples,
i
want
to
point
out,
involve
a
subjective
state
of
mind
with
regard
to
the
homicide
that
was
not
proved
here.
now,
we
think
the
intent
line
is
the
best
line,
but
there
is
also
another
line
that
would
be
a
subjective
state
of
culpability
with
regard
to
the
homicide
be
it
recklessness,
serious...
some
sort
of
awareness
of
it,
and
that
was
not
found
in
this
case.
it
would
be
enough
under
the
model
penal
code.
it
would
be
enough
under
senate
114.
but
it
was
not
found
here.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
thank
you,
your
honor.
