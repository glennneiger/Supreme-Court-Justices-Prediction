mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
real
issue
in
this
case
today
is
whether
a
state
legislature
could
rationally
conclude
that
a
death
sentence
should
be
available
for
a
defendant
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
based
on
his
extensive
participation
in
an
armed
robbery
which
he
planned,
procured
accomplishes
for,
weapons,
participated
in,
and
helped
to
cover
up.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
answered
this
question
in
the--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--that's
right,
your
honor.
there's
a
very
reasonable
inference
which
the
jury
evidently
accepted
that
the.22
pistol
that
ida
jean
shaw
kept
in
her
glove
compartment
was
used,
earl
enmund
had
control
of
that
car
also.
earl
enmund--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--ida
jean
shaw
testified
that
she
kept
a.22
gun
and
a
pistol
in
her
car.
she
also
testified
at
some
place
in
the
record,
and
the
records
are
voluminous...
i
can't
tell
you
what
page...
that
earl
enmund
owned
a.38
caliber
pistol.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
that's
right,
your
honor.
earl
enmund
was
arrested
for
possession
of
a
concealed
weapon,
for
possession
of
a
weapon
by
a
convicted
felon.
earl
enmund,
in
an
attempt
to
alibi
his
involvement,
went
out
and
made
a
big
record
in
the
town
there,
the
local
town,
of
buying
a.38
caliber
pistol
for
defense
two
or
three
days
after
the
murders.
he
was
trying
to
show
that
at
the
time
he
didn't
have
a
pistol
at
the
time
of
the
murders.
i
don't
think
the
jury
believed
that.
in
any
event,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
answered
that
question
i
presented
in
the
affirmative,
and
i
think
that
based
upon
common
sense
and
legal
precedent,
this
court
must
do
the
same.
the
court
should
refuse
to
read
an
absolute
intent
requirement
into
the
eight
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
this
issue
has
not
precisely
been
decided
by
this
court
before,
i
realize
that,
or
we
wouldn't
be
here.
however,
the
court
has
provided
general
constitutional
guidelines.
florida
has
followed
these
guidelines.
florida's
legislative
determination
comports
with
all
the
constitutional
requirements
previously
set
forth
by
this
court.
the
record
before
the
court
presents
a
good
case
where
the
state
courts'
factual
determinations
must
be
accepted.
now,
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
petitioner
argued
this
point,
and
i
quote,
"absence
of
direct
proof
that
the
defendant
intended
to
cause
the
death
of
the
victim
is
highly
relevant
in
determining
the
appropriate
penalty.
"
highly
relevant.
we
don't
contest
that.
now,
however,
petitioner
is
claiming
that
absence
of
proof
of
actual
intent
to
kill
should
be
an
absolute
constitutional
bar
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
he
is
asking
too
much
from
the
constitution.
florida's
position,
as
was
reiterated
in
our
brief
numerous
times,
is
that
the
court
should
refrain
from
drawing
a
bright
line
in
a
case
like
this
in
an
area
which
has
traditionally
been
left
to
the
state
legislatures.
now,
petitioner
counters
with
the
fact
that,
well,
death
is
different.
the
legislature
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
control
this.
yes,
death
is
different,
but
it's
different
for
the
innocent
victims
as
well
as
the
defendant,
and
that
is
the
precise
reason,
the
precise
reason
this
case
is
different
from
coker
v.
georgia.
in
coker,
the
court
has
already
drawn
a
bright
line.
unless
this
court
can
be
persuaded
to
recede
from
that
line,
that
is
where
the
line
should
stay.
if
the
victim
dies,
the
death
penalty
should
be
available.
if
the
victim
lives,
then
death
is
out
of
the
question.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
of
course
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
is
a
legislative
determination,
not
a
judicial
one.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
if
it
complied...
if
their
legislative
determination
complied
with
all
the
factors
previously
enunciated
by
this
court,
with
the
aggravating
factors
and
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
the
weighing
process.
i
doubt
that
could
be
done,
but
the
legislature
does
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
after
coker,
your
honor.
now,
the
florida
legislature
has
constructed
a
statutory
framework
for
imposing
death
sentences
which
complies
with
all
this
court's
previous
opinions.
in
florida,
death
sentences
are
not
automatic.
this
is
proffitt.
the
statute
requires
that
any
evidence
proffered
in
mitigation
must
be
considered
by
the
sentencing
authorities.
this
was
lockett
before
lockett
was
decided.
finally,
the
statute
requires
that
the
sentencing
decision
be
based
upon
the
entire
record.
in
petitioner's
case,
all
three
parts
of
florida's
three-tiered
system
agreed
that
death
was
appropriate.
this
is
a
factual
determination.
the
judgment
of
the
jury,
the
trial
court,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
should
be
respected
by
this
court.
florida
has
based
culpability
in
terms
of
foreseeability.
a
criminal
becomes
fully
responsible
for
his
criminal
conduct.
a
criminal
who
creates
situations
from
which
violence
can
occur
must
suffer
the
consequences
once
that
violence
occurs,
in
this
case
death.
someone
like
earl
enmund,
who
originated
the
idea
for
this
robbery,
procured
the
weapons
and
accomplices,
extensively
participated
in
the
crime,
helped
to
cover
up
the
crime
by
directing
that
the
weapons
be
disposed
of
by
directing
from
his
jail
cell
that
other
defendants
in
the
case
perjured
themselves,
someone
like
earl
enmund,
who
used
the
ill-gotten
gains
from
the
murders
to
pay
off
his
bad
debts,
someone
like
earl
enmund
should
be
eligible
for
the
maximum
penalty,
but
again,
in
florida,
just
because
a
defendant
is
eligible
for
a
maximum
penalty,
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
is
going
to
automatically
get
it.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
the
difference--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--would
be
negligible.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
they
are
still
engaging
in
foreseeably
dangerous
conduct,
depending
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
that
hypothetical.
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
being
prepared
and
willing
to
use
a
weapon
would
be
death,
and
that
is
what
precisely
occurred
here.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
well,
justice
white,
i
have
talked
to
the
prosecutor,
and
he
would
like
to
have
been
able
have
proved
intent,
but
he
couldn't
do
it
because
there
was
no
one
left
who
was
willing
to
talk.
the
two
victims
were
dead.
if
one
of
the
victims
had
lived,
there
is
a
very
good
chance
that
premeditated
murder
could
have
been
proven,
but
just
because
the
defendants
are
skillful
in
killing
their
victims
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
is
left
without
the
right
to
exact
the
maximum
penalty.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
i
didn't
say
earl
enmund
killed
anyone,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
earl
enmund
is
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
based
on
his
participation
under
florida
law.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
any
constitutional
bar
to
that.
that
is
basically
the
felony
murder
rule,
except
you
added
the
part
about
the
firearms.
the
felony
murder
rule
is
beyond
constitutional
challenge.
this
court
has
said
that.
also
the
fact
that
aiders
and
abetters
can
be
held
equally
responsible,
that
is
also
beyond
constitutional
challenge.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
death
is
never
required
in
florida's
statutory
framework.
the
decision
to
impose
death
is
a
mixture
of
considerations.
the
jury
makes
a
recommendation
based
on
the
facts
of
the
crime
and
the
facts
pertaining
to
the
individual,
the
defendant,
and
he
makes...
the
jury
a
recommendation
to
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
can
accept
or
reject
that
recommendation,
and
that
decision
by
the
trial
court
is
then
subject
to
appellate
review.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
do
you
mean
like
treason
or
kidnapping?
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
under
premeditated
murder,
you
have
to
prove
intent
to
kill.
under
felony
murder,
you
have
to
prove
the
participation,
the
actual
participation
in
the
underlying
felony,
and
the
felonies
are
not
just
any
felonies,
like
forgery
is
not
included.
it
would
be
just
dangerous,
violent
felonies,
like
armed
robbery,
or
sexual--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
intent
is
presumed
by
the
participation,
the
willing
participation
in
the
dangerous,
foreseeably
dangerous
conduct.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
that's
right.
you
have
to
prove...
the
jury
has
to
find
that
they
were
participating
in
the
underlying
felony.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
the
death
sentence
in
florida
is
not
automatic.
florida
has
a
statutory
mitigating
circumstance
which
the
jury
must
consider
and
the
trial
court
must
consider.
that
circumstance,
that
mitigating
circumstance
specifically
directs
their
attention
to
an
accomplice's
degree
of
involvement
in
the
felony,
in
the
capital
felony.
if
an
accomplice
is
truly
a
minor
accomplice,
like
earl
enmund
claims,
then
he
is
going
to
have
the
benefit
of
this
mitigating
circumstance.
however,
the
jury
rejected
and
the
trial
court
factually
found
that
earl
enmund
was
a
major
accomplice.
his
involvement
was
major.
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
disturb
that
finding.
that
must
be
accepted
by
this
court.
earl
enmund's
participation
was--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
i
realize
that.
that
argument
is
not
valid
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
i
am
saying
that
florida
directs
that
this
mitigating
circumstance
be
considered.
in
addition
to
that,
the
statute
requires
that
the
individual
nature
of
the
defendant,
the
character
of
the
defendant
and
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
crime
must
be
considered,
and
this
is
taken
from
the
whole
record,
and
in
fact
that's
what
the
trial
court
did.
you
can
read
the
trial
court's
specific
findings.
now,
petitioner
has
attempted
to
cloud
his
culpability
in
this
case
by
making
reference
to
the
spontaneity
of
the
crime,
the
fortuitousness
of
the
crime.
in
other
words,
he
has
claimed
that
his
conduct
was
technically,
technically
no
different
from
coker's,
therefore
he,
like
coker,
can't
get
a
death
sentence.
unfortunately
for
petitioner,
but
more
unfortunately
for
his
victims,
earl
enmund's
case
is
fatally
different.
by
his
willful,
reckless
participation
in
a
foreseeably
dangerous
felony
involving
deadly
weapons,
petitioner
took
the
risk
that
death
might
result,
and
once
that
risk
came
to
fruition
and
once
death
did
result,
the
rationale
behind
coker
is
no
longer
constitutionally
controlling.
the
best
and
the
only
solution
is
to
make
intent
merely
one
of
the
numerous
factors
which
make
up
the
sentencing
equation.
several
of
the
members
of
this
court
have
already
recognized
that.
this
is
what
lockett
requires,
and
this
is
exactly
what
florida's
law
has
done.
intent
should
be
just
a
factor.
now,
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
has
said
that
we
have
grudgingly
admitted
that
intent
can
be
relevant.
we
would
be
trying
to
fool
the
court
if
we
said
intent
was
not
relevant.
but
intent
is
not
controlling.
intent
should
not
be
controlling.
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
eighth
amendment
for
intent
before
a
death
sentence
can
be
imposed.
now,
in
coker,
the
court
set
forth
a
two-pronged
test.
the
first
part
of
the
test
was
whether
a
particular
punishment
contributed
to
the
acceptable
goals
of
punishment
as
recognized
by
society.
the
first
part
that
needs
to
be
discussed
is
deterrence.
now,
petitioner
has
argued
that
one
who
does
not
intend
death
can't
be
deterred.
he
can't
be
deterred
from
what
he
didn't
intend
to
commit.
but
petitioner
has
missed
the
point.
the
point
is
that
florida's
law
is
designed
to
prevent
the
commission
of
the
the
underlying
felony,
the
foreseeably
dangerous
underlying
felony
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
which
is
death.
if
there
was
no
felony
in
this
case,
no
attempted
robbery,
or
no
robbery,
there
wouldn't
have
been
deaths.
if
the
death
penalty
is
made
unavailable
in
situations
like
this,
shrewd,
cunning
criminals
will
insulate
themselves
from
the
death
penalty
by
procuring
less
mentally
gifted
criminals
to
do
their
dirty
work.
that
would
defy
common
sense.
that
would
be
going
against
public
policy
of
allowing
the
states
to
enforce
their
criminal
justice
systems
and
protect
their
citizens
by
criminal
laws
which
need
to
be
enforced.
a
second
situation
that
could
occur
would
be
where
a
smart
criminal
procures
a
juvenile
who,
depending
on
what
happens
in
eddings,
might
not
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
again,
this
would
be
against
public
policy.
a
second
goal
of
punishment
which
a
death
penalty
in
this
type
of
situation
achieves
is
moral
outrage,
or
retribution.
florida's
law
meets
this
goal,
too.
earl
enmund's
moral
guilt
was
presupposed
by
his
participation
in
this
violent
felony.
he
has
been
made
fully
responsible
for
what
he
has
done,
the
old
"an
eye
for
an
eye,
a
tooth
for
a
tooth,
and
a
life
for
a
life.
"
this
theory
of
retribution
allows
society
to
strike
back
for
earl
enmund's
deliberate
act
which
upset
the
moral
order
of
society.
in
fact,
a
felony
murder
is
even
more
reprehensible
than
the
average,
if
you
have
an
average
premeditated
murder.
that
is
because
the
victim
of
a
felony
murder
is
randomly
selected.
there
is
no
rhyme
or
reason.
it
happens
to
be
the
poor
student
who
is
working
in
a
gas
station
at
night,
or
the
poor
person
that
happens
to
be
on
duty
at
a
convenience
store
on
the
late
shift.
there
is
no
reason
for
them
to
die,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
victim.
they
are
murdered
whether
they
are
felony
murdered,
premeditatedly
murdered,
or
whatever
theory
you
want
to
use.
society
is
hurt
the
same
way.
the
victim
is
still
dead,
and
society
has
the
right
to
strike
back
on
the
person
who
caused
these
deaths.
a
final
theory
which
florida's
law
meets
is
incapacitation.
if
a
criminal
who
has
killed
once
is
executed,
he
can't
kill
again.
now,
you
might
say
that
this
doesn't
come
up
very
often,
but
just
the
week
before
last
the
florida
supreme
court
affirmed
a
death
sentence
for
a
prisoner
who
had
been
sent
to
prison
for
murder,
and
he
had
a
life
sentence,
and
he
murdered
again.
if
he
had
been
executed
that
first
time,
no
second
murder
would
have
occurred.
the
second
part
of
the
proportionality
test
that
was
set
forth
in
coker
is
whether
the
punishment
is
grossly--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--he
can't
be
retried
again.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
he
can
be
retried
once.
the
second
part
of
the
proportionality
test
is
whether
the
punishment
is
grossly
out
of
proportion
to
the
severity
of
the
crime.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder,
and
he
hasn't
even
begun
to
attempt
to
challenge
his
conviction.
therefore,
coker's
proportionality
test
is
satisfied.
that
is
all
the
constitution
requires.
the
court
shouldn't
draw
any
further
line
than
what
has
already
been
done.
leave
it
to
the
legislatures.
now,
while
this
is
not
controlling
before
the
court,
it
certainly
should
be
persuasive
that
approximately
half
the
states
have
legislatively
determined
that
death
should
be
available
if
the
constitutional
principles
are
satisfied
in
a
situation
like
this.
this
was
recognized
by
justice
blackmun
and
justice
rehnquist
in
the
lockett
decision.
also
relevant,
but
i
won't
say
controlling,
is
what
congress
is
doing.
i
discuss
this
in
my
brief.
petitioner
disagrees.
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
read
senate
bill
114
for
itself,
but
i
think...
i
am
satisfied
the
court
will
find
that
congress
has
favorably
passed
out
of
committee
a
law
which
would
allow
the
death
penalty
to
be
imposed
on
the
non-homicidal
crimes
of
espionage,
treason,
and
attempted
assassination
of
the
president.
that--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--that
is
the
last
time,
your
honor.
there
is
an
execution...
in
fact,
sampson--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
1965.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
that's
right,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
--sampson
armstrong,
the
co-defendant
here,
is
scheduled
to
die
next
week.
right
now,
at
this
minute,
he
is
having
a
hearing
in
bartow
i
don't
know
what
the
outcome
of
that
is.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
partow,
florida,
in
the
state
court
system
there.
actually,
i
think
it
is
hardee
county,
florida,
where
the
murders
were
committee.
the
federal
statute
i
just
mentioned
would
also
allow
the
death
penalty
where
an
accomplice
intentionally
participates
in
an
act
in
which
there
is
a
risk
of
death
and
the
victim
dies
as
a
direct
result
of
that
act.
the
direct
result
question
would
be
a
jury
question,
but
it
would
allow
for
a
death
sentence
to
be
imposed
in
the
context
like
earl
enmund's
case.
the
house
is
currently
considering
a
similar
bill.
i
don't
have
a
number.
this
bill
was
introduced
after
my
brief
was
filed.
also
persuasive,
but
not
controlling,
is
the
model
penal
code.
the
model
penal
code,
as
outlined
by
the
brief
filed
by
the
washington
legal
foundation
in
this
case,
specifically
includes
accomplices
to
robbery
as
persons
who
could
be
capitally
punished
if
death
occurs.
the
intent
and
recklessness
is
presumed
if
the
murder
is
committed
during
a
robbery.
as
the
foundation
pointed
out,
if
the
model
penal
code
had
been
in
effect
in
florida
when
these
murders
occurred
and
when
the
trial
occurred,
petitioner
could
have
been
sentenced
to
death
under
that
model
penal
code.
next,
i
would
like
to
discuss
petitioner's
argument
that
the
florida
supreme
court
has
eliminated
the
death
sentence
in
cases
like
this.
petitioner
has
cited,
oh,
eight
or
ten
cases
at
the
conclusion
of
his
brief,
but
what
petitioner
fails
to
tell
this
court
is
that
those
cases
all
involved
jury
recommendations
of
life
sentences
which
the
trial
court
overruled
and
the
florida
supreme
court
rejected.
petitioner's
jury
recommended
a
death
sentence.
petitioner's
second
argument
in
his
brief
was
that
this
record
cannot
support
his
death
sentence.
this
argument
should
not
be
persuasive.
the
trial
court
specifically
found,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
upheld
this
finding,
that
earl
enmund's
involvement
was
major,
not
minor,
as
earl
enmund
would
have
you
believe.
but
for
earl
enmund,
these
murders
would
not
have
occurred.
the
jury,
the
trial
court,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
all
agreed
that
death
was
the
appropriate
sentence
for
petitioner.
this
decision
was
reached
after
they
considered
the
unique
circumstances
of
earl
enmund's
character
and
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
crimes.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
it
doesn't
affect
it
at
all
in
this
case
because
there
were
two
valid,
unchallenged
aggravating
circumstances,
no
mitigating
circumstances.
when
there...
under
florida
law,
when
there
is
one
aggravating
circumstance,
no
mitigating
circumstance,
death
is
presumed.
if
the
florida
supreme
court
made
any
mistakes
at
all
in
this
case,
it
would
be
throwing
out
that
factual
finding
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
was
aware
from
the
trial
that
jeanette
armstrong,
who
had
gone
up
to
the
murder
scene,
was
seriously
wounded.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
she
blacked
out.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
victims'
bodies
had
two
different
types
of
bullets
found
in
them,
the
trial
court
took
the
reasonable
inference
that
earl
enmund
had
either
left
the
car
or
never
been
in
the
car
and
gone
up
and
done
the
shooting.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
no,
that
was
based
on
the
entire
record.
mr.
lawrence
a.
kaden
that
was
based
on
the
entire
record,
which
showed
that
he
was
the
one
who
originated
the
plan,
he
planned
the
thing,
he
was
seen
driving
in
the
car
out
there,
seen
driving
back.
he
covered
it
up
by
directing
that
ida
jean
shaw
dispose
of
the
murder
weapons.
his
involvement
was
major.
that
factual
determination
must
be
accepted
by
this
court.
what
the
florida
supreme
court
didn't
say,
and
it
was
not
brought
out
by
the
state,
although
this
is
in
the
record,
willie
lee
testified
that
early
on
the
morning
of
the
murders,
he
observed
the
vehicle
which
was
seen
in
front
of
the
house,
he
observed
it
drive
by
his
place
where
he
was
standing
waiting
for
a
ride.
inside
the
car,
he
testified
that
absolute...
excuse
me,
he
testified
that
ida
jean
shaw
was
driving,
earl
enmund
was
in
the
passenger
seat,
that
there
were
two
unidentified
blacks
in
the
back
of
the
car,
a
male
and
a
female,
two
young
blacks.
he
testified
that
he
was
still
waiting
for
his...
the
same
ride
when
the
vehicle
returned.
this
time,
earl
enmund
was
driving
at
a
reckless
rate
of
speed,
ida
jean
shaw
was
in
the
passenger
seat,
and
one
of
the
blacks
who
had
been
in
the
back
to
begin
with...
i
shouldn't
say
that.
one
of
the
people
in
the
back
seat
was
slumped
over.
okay.
you
might
ask
what
relevance
does
that
have.
all
right.
another
witness
testified
that
she
saw
a
black
male
in
the
car
out
in
front
of
the
victim's
residence.
however,
another
witness
testified
that
the
person
in
the
car
that
he
saw...
this
is
robert
davis.
he
testified
on
cross
examination
that
the
person
he
saw
had
long
hair.
earl
enmund
is
bald.
i
think
the
trial
court
could
take
notice
of
that.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
therefore,
the
only
reasonable
inference
which
the
trial
court
can
make
was
that
earl
enmund
was
not
in
that
car,
since
the
person
who
was
seen
in
the
car
had
long
hair
long
hair.
that
is
in
robert
davis's
testimony,
and
that
wasn't
discussed
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
i
don't
know
why.
finally,
florida
disagrees
with
petitioner's
assertion
that
he
presented
evidence
in
mitigation
in
this
case.
the
record
is
clear
that
he
did
not.
petitioner's
attorney
did
make
a
brief
statement
in
his
closing
argument
concerning
earl
enmund's
involvement,
but
in
florida
as
well
as
probably
most
of
the
other
states,
what
an
attorney
says
is
not
evidence.
even
petitioner's
trial
attorney
recognized
this
when
asked
by
the
trial
court
during
the
sentencing
phase
if
he
had
any
evidence
to
present.
he
replied,
and
i
quote,
"we
have
no
evidence".
that
is
page
1,677
of
the
record.
i
don't
see
how
petitioner
can
come
into
this
court
and
argue
now
that
the
florida
supreme
court
or
the
trial
court
refused
to
consider
what
he
didn't
present.
despite
his
failure
to
present
evidence
in
the
sentencing
phase,
it
is
clear
from
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion
and
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
that
the
entire
record
was
considered.
if
there
had
been
any
evidence
in
mitigation,
it
would
have
been
found.
there
was
none
in
this
case.
florida's
legislative
and
judicial
conclusions
comport
with
all
the
principles
previously
enunciated
by
this
court.
in
short,
there
is
no
constitutional
barrier
to
prevent
the
state
of
florida
from
carrying
out
the
death
sentence
which
was
ordered
six
years
ago
on
this
defendant
for
a
crime
which
was
committed
nearly
seven
years
ago.
the
state
of
florida
urges
this
court,
let
the
constitution
be
controlling
rather
than
individual
notions
of
what
is
fair
in
a
case
like
this.
the
court
must
continue
to
allow
the
various
state
legislatures
to
make
the
laws
and
to
allow
these
laws
to
be
enforced.
crime
needs
to
be
stopped.
the
states
should
be
allowed
to
enforce
their
criminal
laws.
based
on
this
record
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
earl
enmund's
death
sentence
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
